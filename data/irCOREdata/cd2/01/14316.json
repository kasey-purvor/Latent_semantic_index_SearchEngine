The\naccommodation of individual learning styles is often regarded as a way of increasing\nlearning effectiveness. The idea that we can classify a learner and then employ methods and\nactivities that match the way they prefer to learn is an attractive one. The main goal of this\npaper is to examine how software for teaching and learning (courseware) can accom-\nmodate differences in preferred learning style.\nWhat is a learning style?\nBefore presenting some learning style classifications from the literature, it is important to\nclarify what we mean by the term 'learning style'.\nMany learner attributes that can affect performance on a learning task have been identified\n(see Goodyear et al, 1991). They include: intelligence, prior knowledge of the subject\nmatter or skill, motivation, level of anxiety, estimation of learning ability (the learner's\nself-concept), the amount of learner control offered, and preferred cognitive or learning\nstyle (these terms are often used interchangeably).\nA learning style can be defined as the preference that an individual may have for processing\n42\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\ninformation in a particular way when carrying out a learning activity. Learning styles involve\nthe cognitive processes that are implicated in learning, and can be thought of as learning\n'habits' that allow a learner to benefit more from some experiences than from others.\nIt is claimed that accommodation of a learner's preferred learning style is one of several\nfactors that must be in place for effective learning to take place (for example, Corno and\nSnow, 1986; de Corte, 1990). If pedagogical activities accommodate different learning\nstyles, it is argued that motivation will increase and that consequently learning will be more\nenjoyable, effective and efficient. Table 1 shows examples of the different ways in which a\nlearner might approach a learning activity (Goodyear et al, 1991; Groat and Musson\n1995). Note that each category represents a spectrum of possibilities rather than a\npolarized definition. For example, a learner may fall part of the way along the deep-surface\nspectrum, rather than being either wholly a deep learner or wholly a surface learner.\nA global or an analytic orientation towards a subject Tests\nfor this are often visual \/ perceptual.\nThe extent to which learning is meaningful rather than a\nmemorization exercise.This is often related to perception of\nreward.\nImmature learners have a simplistic, dualistic approach, and\nmore mature learners take a more complex, relativistic\napproach.\nConcern with maximizing external rewards (e.g. marks)\nrather than with learning for its own sake.\nThe degree of differentiation or hierarchic integration of\ncognitive structures.\nThe extent to which learners approach tasks with either\nspeed or accuracy as their main objective.\nThe degree to which learners are willing to take chances\nwhen working towards a goal.\nA tendency to converge towards or diverge away from the\n'obvious' when hypothesizing.\nDeep learning involves active engagement with content;\nsurface learning concentrates more on surface form.\nTable I: Examples of learning styles\nA review of learning style classifications\nThree main learning style classifications can be identified as having had some influence on\nthe design of paper- and computer-based learning materials.\nHolists and serialists\nPask (1976) classifies learners as either serialists or holists. Holists prefer to work 'top-down'.\nThey try to build a conceptual framework for the subject matter they are learning, and try to\nlocate elements of their learning within that framework. Detailed understanding of basic\nconcepts is deferred until a later stage: they prefer to get hold of the 'big picture' first.\nSerialists prefer to work 'bottom up'. They prefer to learn one step at a time, acquiring a\nField\ndependence\nMeaningful\nDualistic\nInstrumental\nCognitive\ncomplexity\nReflectivity\nRisk-taking\nConvergence\nDeep\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nIndependence\nRote\nRelativistic\nLearning\nachievement\nSimplicity\n(mpulsivity\nSafety\nDivergence\nSun!ace\nKaren Valley Learning styles and courseware design\ndetailed understanding of basic concepts before gradually moving on to more complicated\nissues. Serialists are initially much less interested in the bigger picture than holists.\nPask claims that this classification is stable across the different tasks a learner might carry\nout (i.e. holists are always holists ho matter what they are doing), and that there is a\nnotable decrease in performance if learners are forced to adopt the non-preferred style of\nlearning. However, the empirical basis for these claims is rather narrow. In addition, Pask\ngeneralized his findings from work on psycho-motor skills to cognitive tasks, and there is\nlittle evidence that this is the case.\nDivergers, assimilators, convergers and accommodators\nKolb's Learning Style Inventory (LSI) measures an individual's relative emphases on two\nbi-polar approaches to learning: the abstract ('thinking') \/ concrete ('feeling') dimension,\nand the active ('doing') \/ reflective ('watching') dimension (Kolb, 1984). Kolb's claim is that\nevery learner has aspects of each classification in his or her preferred learning style, and\nthat these will vary between learners, with different emphases being placed on different\nfactors. The LSI is a 9-item questionnaire where for each item respondents rank-order four\nwords in a way that best describes their preferred learning style. The LSI places learners as\nrelying primarily on dominant learning abilities in one of four categories: diverger,\nconverger, assimilator and accommodator. In summary:\n\u2022 divergers prefer concrete experiences and reflective observation;\n\u2022 convergers prefer abstract conceptualization and active experimentation;\n\u2022 assimilators prefer abstract conceptualization and reflective observation;\n\u2022 accommodators prefer concrete experience and active experimentation.\nTheorists, pragmatists, reflectors and activists\nHoney and Mumford (Honey and Mumford, 1982) found that Kolb's descriptions and\nrelated inventory did not fit with their experiences, and were not meaningful to trainers\nand managers in commercial organizations. They developed a classification and a Learning\nStyles Questionnaire (LSQ) built around recognizable statements of learning behaviour,\nsuch as 'I thrive on the challenge of tackling something new and different', and 'I am\ncareful not to jump to conclusions too quickly'. Respondents are asked to check each\nstatement as either correct (positive) or incorrect (negative). There are no right and wrong\nanswers, and all responses have equal weight. The completed questionnaire is then\nanalysed and the learner's preference for each of four learning styles is established.\nAt a general level, Honey and Mumford's four styles have much in common with Kolb's.\nHowever, their descriptions of learner characteristics and preferred learning activities are\nmore detailed than and are different from the Kolb classification. In summary:\n\u2022 theorists adapt and integrate observations into complex, logically sound theories - they\nthink problems through step-by-step;\n\u2022 pragmatists like to try out ideas, to see if they work in practice - they enjoy\nexperimenting with new applications;\n\u2022 reflectors like to stand back to ponder experiences and observe them from different\nperspectives;\n44\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\n\u2022 activists involve themselves fully in new experiences - they are open-minded and\nenthusiastic about anything new.\nThe Honey and Mumford classification is the most well known among commercial\ntrainers, and recently seems to be receiving a significant amount of attention in education.\nThis is partly due to its accessibility and ease of practical application: a set of positive and\nnegative learning activities is presented for each of the four learning styles. For example, it\nis claimed that activists learn best from activities where there are new experiences and\nopportunities from which to learn; they can become engrossed in short here-and-now\nactivities; and there is a range of diverse activities. They learn least from activities where\nthe task has non-obvious context or apparent purpose, the situation emphasizes emotions\nand feelings, activities are unstructured, and uncertainty and ambiguity are high.\nTailoring learning for learning styles\nThe idea that we can classify learners according to their preferred learning style, and can\nthen match a set of complementary learning activities to that style is an attractive one. It\nhas implications for the development of learning materials and learning activities, and also\nfor decisions regarding the selection of learning opportunities.\nFrom a teaching perspective, it should be possible to identify a set of activities that match\neach learning style, to match appropriate activities to an identified learning need, to\ndetermine the activities most likely to be effective for an individual with that learning need,\nand then to design resources accordingly. Similarly, it should be possible for a learner to\nreview the learning resources and pedagogical activities associated with a particular\nlearning opportunity such as a course or a module, and to assess how these relate to their\npreferred learning style. A course can then be selected or rejected depending on its match\nwith a prospective learner's preferred way of learning.\nA recent paper on this subject (Groat and Musson, 1995) discusses a possible mapping\nbetween learning styles and teaching strategies, and a subsequent translation into\npedagogical methods. The latter includes decisions about the type of learning task\npresented, as well as techniques and strategies for providing feedback, examples, hints,\nreminders, and evaluations. Groat and Musson's analysis is based on the Honey and\nMumford classification. It begins by mapping the four learning styles onto the bi-polar\ndimensions of two teaching strategies (concrete\/abstract and safety\/challenge). Pragmatists\nare in the concrete\/safety sector; activists in the concrete\/challenge sector; theorists in the\nabstract\/challenge sector and reflectors in the abstract\/safety sector. This mapping is then\ntranslated into the pedagogical methods that are seen as appropriate for each sector. For\nexample, graphics are deemed to be better than text for presenting concrete examples, and\n'clear structure' is better than 'freedom to explore' for learners who prefer safety to\nchallenge. Thus, learners in the concrete\/safety sector (pragmatists) are given graphical\nexplanations and demonstrations, and are shown how to do a task before being given an\nopportunity to perform similar tasks.\nKey issues\nWhile it is clear that individuals can exhibit a preference for learning in a particular way, it is less\nclear that this preference is stable and reliable. Honey and Mumford claim that the LSQ has\n4S\nKaren Valley Learning styles and courseware design\nhigh validity with regard to classifying learners. Although there is some research attempting to\ntest this claim (Allinson and Hayes, 1990, and Fung et al, 1993 are two examples), there is little\nconclusive evidence. A number of key issues must be addressed in this regard.\nAre learning styles constant over time?\nWhile it may be possible to classify a learner on one occasion, there is little evidence that\nthe classification will apply the next time we encounter that learner. We can think of a\nnumber of internal and external factors that may affect a preference for one way of\nlearning over another on any one occasion. Internal factors are considered under learner\nattributes (see below). External factors include the time available for learning (for example,\nhaving time to experiment and hypothesize versus a need to find out information quickly),\nthe learning objective (for example, learning for learning's sake versus learning for job\nperformance), and the nature of available learning resources (for example, the media\nemployed, such as text, video, audio, graphics).\nAre learning styles subject-dependent?\nThere is little evidence to suggest that a preference for learning one topic in a particular\nway will carry over to any other topic. It is not even clear that preferences are constant\nwithin a topic: a learner may prefer to learn different aspects of a topic in different ways.\nHow does preferred learning style interact with other learner attributes?\nA number of learner attributes that might affect performance: intelligence, prior\nknowledge, motivation, anxiety levels, self-concept, and learner control. As a crude\nmeasure, we can imagine that each attribute will have a 'level' somewhere between 'none'\nand 'high' on any learning task. The attributes cannot be independent: the level of one\nmust affect that of others. It should therefore be assumed that the attribute levels in play\nfor any learning task will also affect learning-style preference.\nShould learners always be able to learn in their preferred way?\nPask (1976) claimed to observe a decrease in performance if learners were 'forced' to learn\nin their non-preferred style. However, it may not always possible for learners to learn in\ntheir preferred way: the very nature of the subject matter or skill to be learned may dictate\nthe most appropriate style of learning, and this may be incompatible with the preferred\nstyle. In addition, a learning-style preference may be largely down to habit. Jt is possible\nthat helping learners to be more flexible and to employ different learning strategies where\nrequired is more appropriate than trying to accommodate individual preference.\nIs it feasible to classify learners?\nIn addition to issues of validity and predictive value, there are practical issues regarding\nthe classification of learners using a tool such as the LSQ. Even if a computer-based\nversion of the tool is available, it is highly impractical to hope to classify anything other\nthan a small number of learners. In higher-education teaching, where intakes can often run\ninto the hundreds, classification of individual learners may simply not be feasible.\nImplications for courseware design\nIt is clear that there are different styles of learning, even if a preference for any one style\nmay not be stable and reliable. One way of making courseware more effective may be to\nensure that it takes account of learning-style preference. If possible, this must be done in a\n46\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 2\nway that addresses the issues raised above. In this section we present two courseware design\nsolutions that demonstrate how courseware can accommodate preferred learning style.\nEach is illustrated by an example showing its practical application. The first solution\nfollows on from traditional research into learning styles, and assumes that it is possible to\nclassify learners in advance. The second addresses some of the issues identified above.\nHoney and.Mumford's classification is used for illustrative purposes in all examples.\nDesigning for a known learning-style preference\nThe first design solution assumes that it is possible to classify learners as having a preferred\nlearning style in advance of their using the courseware. This could be done by having the\nlearner use a tool such as the LSQ, either paper-based or computer-based. Alternatively, a\nlearner profile could be entered in advance for each learner who will use the courseware, stating\nhis or her preferred learning style as perceived by himself or herself or by tutors. Regardless of\nmethod, the assumption is that the learner's preferred style is known by the system.\nlearner\nactivist, pragmatist, reflector or theorist\noption 1 option 2 option 3 option 4\nif learner = activist\nthtn present option 1\nif learner = pregmatist\nthtn present option 2\nif learner = theorist\nthtn present option 3\ny learner =reflector\nth tn presen t opti on 4Figure I'.Courseware design solution\nwhere preferred learning style is known\nFigure 1 illustrates this design solution. The learner is classified in advance as either an\nactivist, pragmatist, reflector or theorist. All subsequent interaction between the system\nand the learner, such as the presentation of material, any feedback given, remediation\nactivities, and the amount of control offered to the learner, is influenced by the initial\nclassification. At each stage of the interaction, there are four options, representing a\ndifferent learning style classification. Each option prompts a different set of interactions,\nlinked to the most appropriate methods and activities for that classification.\nFigure 2 presents an example of the practical application of this solution. The courseware\nis required to provide feedback in response to a question that the learner has answered\nincorrectly. The feedback given will depend on the initial classification of the learner:\n\u2022 if the learner is a pragmatist, the system will present some related examples and re-ask\nthe initial question;\n\u2022 if the learner is an activist, the system will give the correct answer straight away, and\nwill move on;\n47\nKaren Volley Learning styles and courseware design\nif the learner is a theorist, the system will explain why the learner's answer is wrong in\nterms of the theoretical framework behind the topic, and will re-ask the question;\nif the learner is a reflector, the system will review the material already presented, asking\nhim or her to think about specific points, and will then re-ask the original question.\nlearner=X\nX = activist, pragmatist, reflector or theorist\nPresent related examples\nRe-ask question\npragmatist N ^\n(\nreflector ^s\nReview material\nRe-ask question\n^ \u2014 ^\nProvide\nfeedback\nGive correct answer\n\\yyactmsl\nExplain why answer is wrong\nRe-ask question\nfigure 2: Courseware\ndesign example where\npreferred learning style is\nknown\nWhile this is a relatively simple example, it serves to show how a piece of courseware could\naccommodate individual preference for learning in a particular way, where the preferred\nlearning style is known in advance. However, the solution does not address the issues raised\nabove: the stability of learning styles over time, their interaction with other learner\nattributes, and their constancy across and within topics, as well as the feasibility of\nclassifying learners in advance.\nDesigning for an unknown learning-style preference\nThe second design solution demonstrates how courseware can accommodate different\nlearning styles without having an initial learner classification. This solution is attractive\nbecause it overcomes some of the problems discussed above. It acknowledges a preference\nfor learning in different ways, while taking account of the fact that it may not be possible to\nclassify learners in advance, and that preferences may not be stable and reliable. Figure 3\nillustrates this design solution. For any interaction between the system and the learner,\nsuch as the presentation of material, provision of feedback, selection of remediation\nactivities, and the amount of control offered to the learner, there are four options available.\nAs with the first solution, each option corresponds to a set of activities that are\nappropriate for each of the four learning styles. However, there are two versions of this\nsolution.\nIn the courseware-controlled version, the courseware would choose a default option,\nperhaps based on a heuristic such as 'always select the activist option because most people\nare activists'. Having presented the activities associated with the selected option, the\n48\nALT-] Volume 5 Number 2\nC interaction J\noption 1 option 2 option 3 option 4\nCoursttt are-con trolled\nSystem presents default option, m onitorj\nperform an ce and re-presents m aterial using\nalternative options if necessary\nLiarn tr-controlled\nLearner selects options according to current\nlearning style preferencefigure 3: Courseware design solution where\nthe preferred learning style is not known\nsystem would monitor learner performance, and could re-present the material by selecting\none of the other options if necessary. This would require careful monitoring of user-\nperformance, and, depending on the sophistication of the monitoring techniques\nemployed, could easily come up against many of the problems faced by the learner-\nmodelling community (see Self, 1988; Wenger, 1987). A simpler solution would be to adopt\na 'wide-net' approach, presenting activities linked to all four options. This ensures that at\nleast some will match the learner's preferred learning style. There may also be additional\nbenefit from having learners tackle a topic in a number of ways. While not ideal, this is\nconsiderably better than the one-size-fits-all approach taken by most courseware.\nIn the learner-controlled version of the courseware, learners would select their preferred\noption. Any number and combination of the four options could be selected. This would\nallow learners to select learning activities according to their preferred learning style at that\ntime, for that subject. It would also allow them to have access to the same material in a\nnumber of ways.\nfigure 4: Courseware design example where the\npreferred learning style is not known\n.Presented within\ntheoretical framework\nFigure 4 presents an example of the practical application of this design solution. The\ncourseware has four ways of presenting a topic to the learner. Although the options have\nbeen developed with reference to suitable activities for the four identified learning styles,\nthe learner's preferred style has not been established in advance.\n49\nKaren Valley Learning styles and courseware design\nIn the courseware-controlledVersion of this example, the courseware could initially present,\nas the default option, a highly interactive activity related to the topic. The learners'\nsubsequent interaction with the courseware, such as their responses to questions, would be\nmonitored. Any perceived under-performance would be remediated by re-presentation of\nthe material using one of the other methods, such as applying the subject matter to a real-\nlife situation. Monitoring and re-presentation could continue until all four activities had\nbeen presented. In the simpler implementation of this version, avoiding performance\nmonitoring, all four activities would be presented to the learner in a pre-defined order (for\nexample: present material within a theoretical framework, present passive activity, apply\nmaterial to real life situation, and finish with highly interactive activity).\nIn the learner-controlled version of this example, the courseware would offer the learner\nfour options regarding presentation of the topic. The learner would select the most suitable\nactivity for his or her currently preferred way of learning. For example, one learner might\nfeel that for him or her the topic under discussion would be more easily comprehended if\npresented within a theoretical framework. A different learner might prefer to see how the\nsubject applies to real-life situations before taking on board more theoretical concepts.\nConclusions\nIn this paper we outlined a number of ways of classifying learners according to preferred\nlearning style, and raised a number of issues regarding the feasibility of tailoring learning\nto accommodate learning styles. We presented two solutions that illustrate how courseware\ndesign can take into account individual preference for learning in a particular way. The\nfirst solution assumes that it is possible to classify a learner in advance. The classification\ndetermines the nature of any subsequent user-system interaction, such as the learning\nactivities presented, the feedback given, methods used for remediation of errors and the\namount of learner-control offered. The solution follows on from traditional research into\nlearning styles in assuming that preference is stable over time, task, topic and so oh. The\nsecond solution requires no advance classification of the learner. It provides an\nopportunity for learners to address a topic through a range of activities, appropriate for all\nlearning styles, under the control of either the courseware or the learner. This solution\nmakes no assumptions about the stability of learning-style preference. Both solutions are\ntechnically feasible for courseware developed using general purpose programming\nenvironments such as Visual Basic or C or relatively sophisticated authoring systems such\nas Authorware and IconAuthor (which allow global variables and which can accommodate\nbranching and looping constructs).\nHowever, the pedagogical feasibility of accommodating learning-style preference must also\nbe considered, whether we are discussing the design of computer-based or paper-based\nlearning materials. Although some speculative research has been carried out (Groat and\nMusson, 1995), there is not yet a sufficiently clear mapping between learning styles,\nteaching strategies and learning activities. With regard to computer-assisted learning in\nparticular, it is unclear which specific characteristics of a learner interact with particular\nfeatures of a piece of courseware, or how this interaction affects learning effectiveness. It is\nnot sufficient to present learners with a range of suitable activities: there must be\ninteraction between the learner and the courseware that actively engages the learner, in the\nlearning process. Recent research on learning with interactive media suggests 12\n50\nALT-J Volume 5 Number 2\npsychological processes (or learning functions) that must be engaged if learning is be\neffective (Shuell, 1992). Examples include prior knowledge, hypothesis generation, and\nmotivation. Further research in this area could usefully focus on mapping learning styles,\ncomputer-based teaching strategies and a range of interactive learning activities that seek\nto stimulate relevant cognitive processes. This includes issues surrounding the appropriate\nuse of multimedia resources, including video, audio, images and animation\nI would argue that currently very little is known about the stability of learning styles, across a\nnumber of dimensions. Attempting to classify learners and to present only those activities\nwhich match their preferred style is therefore not a useful or worthwhile activity. However, a\nsignificant amount is known about the different ways in which any group of learners might\nprefer to learn. We should therefore at least aim to accommodate potential preference by\npresenting learners with a range of activities, even if at this stage we can only speculate about\nthe most appropriate teaching strategies and pedagogical activities for each style.\nReferences\nAllinson, C.W. and Hayes, J.
