Interest in the introduction of trees in arable systems in Europe is \nincreasing to diversify the farm landscape, promote biodiversity, enhance \nproductivity, and benefit from the function of trees as windbreaks or as protection \nagainst nitrogen leaching, flooding and erosion. In recent years, European agricultural \npolicy has sought to reduce arable surpluses and increase the number of trees planted on \nfarms (Burgess et al., 2000). Unlike monoculture forestry, silvoarable agroforestry can \nprovide an annual income. This is obtained from an arable intercrop which is grown for \nthe initial or full duration of the tree rotation, depending in part on the tree density. In \ntropical countries, there are economic benefits from timber and non-timber tree products \non arable land and the production of annual intercrops in plots planted with trees (Graves \net al., 2004). Such diversification contributes to economic resilience to external \nfluctuations in markets. When the tree and crop component in their respource use, for \ninstance, when the trees use a resource, such as water in deeper soil layers, that is not \naccessible to the crop (Droppelmann et al., 2000), the productivity in agroforestry can \nexceed the productivity in equivalent areas of arable or forestry monocultures.  \nComplementarity may also exist when tree stands are young and do not capture all the \navailable light. Complementarity lays a basis for higher economic returns.  \n \nTo express the benefits of mixed cropping systems various characteristics have been \nproposed (Vandermeer, 1989). In the current analysis a choice has been made for the use \nof the Land Equivalent Ratio LER), first proposed by Mead and Willey (1980). LER is \ndefined as: ratio of the area needed under sole cropping to the area of intercropping at \nthe same management level to obtain a particular yield. LER is calculated as the sum \nof the fractions of the yields of the intercrops relative to their sole crop yields: \n \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n3\n1 2\n1 2\n... n\nn\nII ILER\nM M M\n= + + +  [1] \nwhere \nI is the yield of crop when intercropped; M is the yield of crop as a monoculture; 1 is \none crop; 2 is another crop; n is the nth crop. \n \nIn agroforestry systems, which are characterized by differences in growing period of \nthe component plant species of the mixture, many approaches are possible to calculate \nan integrated value of LER over multi-year periods. In this paper we calculate LER in \ntwo ways. The first method integrates productivity over the whole rotation, \ncalculating LER as the sum of (1) average value of relative crop yield, compared to \nmonocrop crop yields, and (2) cumulative timber production compared to the \nmonoculture (Equation 2): \n \nrotation\nSilvoarable crop yield Silvoarable timber volumeLER Average\nMonoculture crop yield Monoculture timber volume\n\u239b \u239e= +\u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0 [2] \n \nThe second method of calculating LER produces an estimate for each year i in the tree \nrotation. This estimate is calculated as the sum of (1) the relative crop yield in year i \n(compared with monocrop crop yield in the same year) and (2) cumulative timber \nproduction from year 1 through i (compared with monoculture tree growth from year \n1 through i) (Equation 3). \n \nSilvoarable crop yield Silvoarable timber volumeLER\nMonoculture crop yield Monoculture timber volume\ni i\ni\ni i\n= +  [3] \n \nThus, LERi of Equation 3 integrates the relative crop yield in agroforestry in a single \nyear i with the timber volume, accumulated from the start of the agroforestry stand \nuntil year i, standardized against the timber volume accumulated in monoculture.  \n \nTwo of the key factors in determining adoption and maintenance of silvoarable systems \nare their profitability relative to alternative enterprises and their feasibility, in terms of \nthe use of farm resources (Burgess et al., 2000; Graves et al., 2005b). The profitability of \nsilvoarable systems, relative to pure arable agriculture and forestry, can be determined by \ncomparing their net present value (NPV), calculated from cost-benefit analysis by \ndiscounting and aggregating future benefits and costs (Graves et al., 2005a). The \nfeasibility of the system, within a specific farm depends, among others, on the \navailability of and requirements for labour or finance. Fundamental to both assessments, \nis the need for biophysical data on yields of crops and trees in silvoarable as well as in \narable and forestry systems. As empirical data on silvoarable systems are scarce, an \nalternative method is necessary to generate long-term time series of yields based on \ninteractions of trees and crops in mixed systems. Such a method is the use of dynamic \ncomputer simulations that predict the effect of climate, tree and crop species, soil type \nand management choices on tree and crop production, economics and the environment.  \n \nThe need for a minimal modelling approach \nKey issues in the analysis of dynamic simulation models are stability, sensitivity of \nthe output to parameter values, uncertainty propagation and identifiability. \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n4\nIdentifiability analysis attempts to answer the question: can we estimate a unique \nvalue for specific parameter, given sufficient data? In general, identifiability decreases \nwith increasing complexity of a model, because of the potential interactions between \nparameters. If, for a complex model, poorly identifiable parameters are estimated \nfrom experimental data, errors in parameter estimates may become very large. As a \nconsequence, uncertainty in model predictions will become large. Hence, from the \nviewpoint of restricting uncertainty in model predictions, a minimal modelling \napproach, allowing estimation of a maximum set of identifiable parameters, is \npreferred (Young, 1984; Ljung, 1987). The need for a minimal modelling approach is \nhigh for agroforestry systems, because of the lack of quantitative long term data on \nthe productivity of those systems. \n \nCurrently available biophysical models for agroforestry systems, such as WaNulCAS \n(Van Noordwijk & Lusiana, 1999) and HyPAR (Mobbs et al. 1999) are highly \ncomplex and rich in parameters, and the above-mentioned drawbacks of complex \nmodels apply. As an alternative approach, a very parameter sparse, yet process-based \nmodel is proposed and presented here. The conceptual and algorithmic simplicity of \nthis model, called YIELD-SAFE1, allow the application of powerful mathematical \nmethods for parameter estimation, and the analysis of uncertainties in model \npredictions. The model can be easily adapted to different crops and environmental \nconditions by adjusting parameter values and input functions (Graves et al., 2007), \nand its code is compact enough to be included in agro-environmental modelling \nenvironments that aim at levels of aggregation above the field level (Rabbinge & van \nLatesteijn, 1992; van Ittersum & Donatelli, 2001). \n  \nThe ultimate goal of the YIELD-SAFE model is to predict dynamically site-specific \nlong-term tree and crop yields under competitive conditions on the basis of historical \nor generated weather data, i.e. solar radiation, temperature and precipitation and \nrelevant soil physical characteristics. Growth of trees and crops can essentially be \ndescribed as the conversion of primary resources, i.e. light, water and inorganic ions \ninto useful organic material, and can therefore be described in terms of the availability \nof these resources and their utilization efficiency (Monteith, 1990). The objective of \nthe current version of the model is to describe conditions where availability of plant \nnutrients is not a limiting factor for crop production, hence light and temperature as \nyield-determining factors and water as (possible) yield-limiting factor (van Ittersum \nand Rabbinge, 1997) are taken into account.  \n \nThe objectives of this paper are: \n- To describe and justify the conceptual background and equations of Yield-SAFE; \n- To provide the first calibration and validation of Yield-SAFE, using published \nyield tables for poplar stands and two experimental data sets pertaining to the \ngrowth of an agroforestry system with poplars and arable crops at two sites in the \nUnited Kingdom. \n- To provide a sensitivity analysis of Yield-SAFE. \n \n                                                 \n1 YIeld Estimator for Long term Design of Silvoarable AgroForestry in Europe \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n5\nMATERIALS & METHODS \n \nModel description \nThe objective of the YIELD-SAFE model is to describe the dynamics of competitive \nresource acquisition and the associated growth of the constituent components in an \nagroforestry stand with the minimum number of equations. Such an equation- and \nparameter-sparse approach is chosen because it provides the best chance that robust \nparameter values can be identified from experiments. Dynamic equations for the \nfollowing state variables were identified as essential: \n \n(1) biomass of tree \n(2) leaf area of tree \n(3) number of shoots of tree \n(4) biomass of crop \n(5) leaf area of crop \n(6) heat sum \n(7) available soil water \n \nBiomasses of tree and crop are used to derive temporally-integrated timber volumes \nand crop yields. Leaf area of tree and crop are essential because they govern radiation \ncapture, and thus the capacity for dry matter production and the associated water loss \nthrough transpiration. The number of shoots per tree is required because it governs the \npotential leaf area within a given year. By contrast the intra-annual leaf area dynamics \n(at the time scale of days to months) are primarily governed by the growth of leaf area \nper shoot. Available soil water is included to account for differential growth \nconditions across Europe with respect to the degree of water limitation, due to \nvariation in precipitation, soil depth and water holding properties of soils. Finally, \nheat sum is integrated each season to define phenological development of the crops. \nNutrient dynamics are not included, because of lack of information from existing \nagroforestry trials necessary to determine pertinent parameters. The model can be \nreadily extended to include nutrient dynamics, e.g. by quantifying the minimum \nnutrient uptake required to produce calculated water-limited yields (cf. van Keulen & \nWolf, 1988).  \n \nEquations and associated parameters were developed as follows: \n \nPotential tree growth \nThe potential growth rate of the woody biomass of the tree (Bt) is described as: \n \nt t td\nd\nB I f\nt\n\u03b5\n\u03c1=  [4] \n \nwhere Bt is the woody biomass of the tree (g dry matter per tree); I is the global \nradiation, incoming to the forestry or agroforestry stand (MJ per m2 per day); tf  is the \nproportion of incoming radiation (I) intercepted by the trees; \u03b5t is the radiation use \nefficiency of the trees (g woody dry matter per MJ intercepted global radiation), and \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n6\n\u03c1 is the tree density (number of trees per m2 silvoarable area).  The variable t \n(italicized) is time (d), while the subscript t (in roman type) indicates parameters and \nvariables for the tree. \n \nThe fraction of radiation intercepted by the trees in the agroforestry system is \ncalculated as: \n \nt t\nt 1\nk Lf e\u2212= \u2212  [5] \n \nwhere kt is the radiation extinction coefficient of the tree leaf canopy; Lt is the leaf \narea index of the tree stand (m2 tree leaf area per m2 silvoarable stand). \n \nWater limited effective tree growth \nUnder water-limiting conditions, and accounting for biomass losses due to \nmaintenance or attrition such as branch senescence and storm damage, Equation [4] is \nmodified into: \nt t t t\nt\nd\nd\nB I f w aB\nt\n\u03b5\n\u03c1= \u2212  [6] \n \nwhere tw  expresses the relative effect of soil water potential on the tree growth rate \nand a is the relative rate of biomass loss due to maintenance and attrition. The factor \nwt is calculated as:  \n \nc t\nPWP\nc PWP t\nPWP c\nPWP t\npF pF : 1\npF pFpF pF pF :\npF pF\npF pF : 0\nw\nw\nw\n\u23a7 \u2264 =\u23aa \u2212\u23aa < \u2264 =\u23a8 \u2212\u23aa\u23aa > =\u23a9\n [7] \n \nwhere pF is the soil water tension, defined as the negative log of the water potential in \ncm water. Hence as long as pF is below the critical value (pFc), there is no reduction, \nwhen pF is between the critical value and the permanent wilting point ( PWPpF ), the \ndegree of reduction is proportional to the difference between current pF and PWPpF  as \nscaled by the difference between pFc and PWPpF , while the reduction is 100% when pF \nis greater than PWPpF  (Fig. 1). \n \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al.

Outside the growing season, the rate of change \nof tree biomass is set to 0. \n \nWater use by the tree \nThe amount of water that is used by the trees per unit area per day is calculated by \nmultiplying the water-limited growth rate per tree with the tree density (\u03c1) and a \ntranspiration coefficient, t\u03b3 : \n \nt\nt t\nd\nd\nBW\nt\n\u03b3 \u03c1=  [8] \n \nwhere tW is the tree water use (m\n3 water per m2 silvoarable area per day); t\u03b3  is the \ntranspiration coefficient of the trees (m3 water per g woody dry matter) \n \nLeaf area of the tree \nThe rate of increase in leaf area index of a tree leaf canopy ( tL ) is calculated as: \n \nt md\nd\nL A AN\nt\n\u03c1 \u03c4\n\u2212=  [9] \n \nwhere Lt is the leaf area index of the tree (m2 tree leaf area per m2 silvoarable area); \u03c1 \nis the density of trees (number of trees per m2 silvoarable area); N is the number of \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n8\nshoots on a single tree (see below); Am is the maximum leaf area per shoot on a tree \n(m2); A is the current leaf area per shoot on a tree (m2; see below); \u03c4 is the time \nconstant of the leaf unfolding process (day) as driven by re-allocation of reserve \ncarbohydrates in the spring (Versteeg and van Keulen, 1986) \n \nThe rationale for Equation 9 is that early leaf growth in trees is not an autonomous \npositive feedback process as in crop plants, governed by incident radiation \ninterception, but a translocation and conversion process from reserve carbohydrates, \nstored at the end of the preceding season, to new leaf biomass. Hence, the dynamics \nare fundamentally different. The state variable N, the number of shoots on a tree, \nexpresses the \u201cmemory\u201d of the tree with respect to preceding year\u2019s number of \nbranches and storage of reserve carbohydrates. Leaves start to unfold at time tb, the \ndate of bud burst and all leaf canopy is shed at the day of leaf fall (tf).  \n \nNumber of shoots per tree \nThe number of shoots per tree is calculated on the basis of a saturating curvilinear \nMonod function of tree biomass, according to: \n \nt\nm\nt N\nBN N\nB K\n= +  [10] \nwhere Nm is the maximum number of shoots on a mature tree; KN is the biomass of a \nsingle tree at which the number of shoots is half the maximum.  As KN is difficult to \nestimate from data, an expression for the growth of N was derived from which the \nparameter KN is eliminated. \n \nFrom Equation 10 we derive: \n \nm\ntN\nN NK B\nN\n\u2212=  [11] \n \nAfter differentiation of Equation [10] and substitution of Equation [11] one obtains: \n \nt\nt m\ndd 1\nd d\nBN N N\nt t B N\n\u239b \u239e= \u2212\u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n [12] \n \nwith unknown initial condition N(t0) where t0 is the planting date of the trees. In \npractice, N(t0) is easier to estimate from experimental data than KN, hence this \nreformulation of the model. Furthermore, Equation 12 allows a straightforward \nadjustment of the tree growth in case of pruning. \n \nPruning and thinning \nWhen pruning takes place, biomass and number of shoots are reduced by appropriate \nfactors \u03c0B and \u03c0N, which can, in principle, be different. Thinning is effectuated by \nreducing tree density \u03c1 by a thinning factor \u03c0\u03c1.  \n \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n9\nPotential crop growth \nWithin each cropping season, crop biomass starts at an initial value of Bc(te) where te \nis the date of crop emergence. The subsequent potential growth rate of the crop is \ndescribed as: \n \nc\nc c c\nd\nd\nB I f\nt\n\u03b5=  [13] \n \nwhere Bc is the above-ground biomass of the crop (g dry matter per m2 silvoarable \narea); Ic is the radiation available to the crop (MJ per m2 silvoarable area); fc is the \nproportion of Ic intercepted by the crop; \u03b5c is the radiation use efficiency of the crop (g \nabove-ground dry matter per MJ intercepted global radiation) \n \nThe radiation available to the crop is calculated as: \n \n( )c t1I f I= \u2212  [14] \n \nwhere tf is the proportion of incoming global radiation intercepted by the tree crowns \nand I is global radiation, incoming to the agroforestry stand (MJ per m2 per day) \n \nThe fraction of radiation intercepted by the crop ( cf ) is calculated as: \nc\nc\nc 1\nLk\nCf C e\n\u2212\u239b \u239e= \u2212\u239c \u239f\u239d \u23a0\n [15] \nwhere C is the proportion of the total area that is cropped (m2 cropped area per m2 \nsilvoarable area); kc is the radiation extinction coefficient of the crop; Lc is the leaf \narea index of the crop (m2 crop leaf area per silvoarable area) \n \nWater-limited crop growth \nUnder water limiting conditions, Equation [13] is modified into: \n \nc\nc c c c\nd\nd\nB I f w\nt\n\u03b5=  [16] \n \nwhere cw  expresses the reduction in crop growth rate, relative to the potential growth \nrate. This is calculated in the same way as the value for wt (Equation 7, Figure 1), but \nwith crop specific parameter values for pFc and pFPWP. \n \nWater use by the crop \nWater use by the crop is calculated by multiplying the water-limited growth rate by a \ntranspiration coefficient, c\u03b3 : \nc c\nd\nd\ncBW\nt\n\u03b3=  [17] \nwhere Wc is the crop water uptake (m3 water per m2 silvoarable area per day)  \nc\u03b3  is the transpiration coefficient of the crop (m3 water per g above-ground dry \nmatter.

Leaf \narea starts at an initial value of Lc(te) where te is the date of emergence.  Leaf area \ngrowth is set to zero when the heat sum at harvest (Sh) is attained (see below). \n \nHeat sum \nThe increase in cumulative temperature (heat sum) is calculated as:  \n \n[ ]bd max 0,d\nS T T\nt\n= \u2212  [19] \n \nwhere S is the heat sum since crop emergence (\u00b0C d); T is daily average temperature \n(\u00b0C); bT is the base temperature for phenological development (\u00b0C); the function max \n[ ] takes the maximum value of the arguments. \n \nPartitioning of dry matter to leaves in the crop \nPartitioning of dry matter to leaves decreases linearly with crop development stage, \naccording to: \n \n1 0\n2\n1 2 0\n2 1\n2\n:\n:\n: 0\nS S P P\nS SS S S P P\nS S\nS S P\n\u23a7 \u2264 =\u23aa \u2212\u23aa < \u2264 =\u23a8 \u2212\u23aa\u23aa > =\u23a9\n [20] \n \nwhere P0 is the proportion of above-ground biomass initially partitioned to leaves; S1 \nis heat sum where partitioning of dry matter to leaves starts to decline; S2 is heat sum \nwhere the partitioning coefficient becomes zero. \n \nSoil water dynamics \nThe model assumes a homogeneous soil of depth D (m) and volumetric water content \n\u03b8, which is described by:  \n( )irr gw c t actd 1d R W F W W Et D\u03b8 = + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212  [21] \nwhere \u03b8 is soil volumetric moisture content (m3 per m3); R is precipitation (m3 per m2 \nsilvoarable area per day); Wirr is irrigation (m3 per m2 silvoarable area per day); Fgw is \ndrainage of soil water below the potential rooting zone (m3 per m2 silvoarable area per \nday); Eact is actual soil evaporation (m3 per m2 silvoarable area per day) \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al.

For ease of notation, the \ntension is then expressed in terms of pF, where pF = log10(\u03c8), with \u03c8 is expressed in \ncm water tension. The relation between \u03c8 and \u03b8 is given by the van Genuchten (1980) \nequation: \nPWP PWP\n1( )\n1 ( )\nm\ns n\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b1\u03c8\n\u23a1 \u23a4= + \u2212 \u23a2 \u23a5+\u23a3 \u23a6  [22] \n \nwhere s\u03b8 is soil water content at saturation (m3 per m3); PWP\u03b8 is soil water content at \npermanent wilting point (the lower limit of plant-available water in m3 per m3); \u03b1 , m \nand n are soil-type specific parameters; \u03c8  is soil water tension in cm water. \n \nPrecipitation and irrigation are introduced as forcing functions.

A default \nvalue of 2 is assumed for \u03d5. If soil water data is available, \u03d5 will be estimated \nbetween 1 and 4 depending on the water distribution in the soil, which depends on \nmany factors, but especially on soil characteristics.  \n \nEvaporation from the soil surface (Eact) is calculated as: \n \nact s sE I w\u03b7=          [25] \n \nwhere \u03b7 is the heat of vaporization (m3 water per MJ); Is is the radiation incident on \nthe soil (MJ per m2 per day); sw is a factor accounting for the reduction in soil \nevaporation due to drying of the soil, and is calculated in the same way as the \nreduction factor for the tree (Equation 7; Fig. 1) \n  \nRadiation incident on the soil (Is) is calculated as: \n \n( )s t c (1 )I I f Cf C= + \u2212  [26] \n \nwhere ft is the proportion of incoming radiation intercepted by the trees, fc is the \nradiation interception by the crop as a fraction of the amount of radiation incident on \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n12\nthe crop, and C is the proportion of cropped area. The formula combines the \ncontributions of cropped area ( t c I f Cf ) and uncropped area ( t (1 )I f C\u2212 ) to the total \nradiation incident on the soil. \n \nModel implementation \nThe model has been implemented as a set of difference equations on several computer \nplatforms including MatLab (Stappers et al., 2003) and Microsoft\u00a9 Excel (Burgess et \nal., 2004b). These references give further implementation details that are omitted here \nfor clarity. \n \nPoplar validation data \nTwo agroforestry experiments with poplar (Populus species) were carried out in the \nUnited Kingdom. Full initial details of the experiments are provided by Burgess et al. \n(2004a), but the key features are summarised here. The cooler and most northerly site \nis at the Leeds University Farms at Bramham near Tadcaster in West Yorkshire \n(53\u00b053\u2019 N, 1\u00b015\u2019 W); the warmest site is at Silsoe in Bedfordshire (52\u00b00\u2019 N, 0\u00b026\u2019 W) \nin eastern England. Soils at the Leeds and Silsoe sites are sandy clay loam over \nlimestone and clay over clay, respectively. At both sites the main experiment covered \n2.5 ha and comprised three replicate blocks that included each combination of four \npoplar hybrids and three or four arable treatments.  \n \nPoplars were planted as unrooted sets in spring 1992 at a rectangular spacing of 10 m \nbetween tree rows (in a North-South orientation) and 6.4 m between trees within the \nrows. Part of the alleys between the tree rows were cropped yearly in the middle 8 m \n(leaving a 2 m uncultivated strip for the tree row), while another part of the alleys was \nleft uncropped and weed free in subsequent years in order to obtain estimates of the \nyield of poplar in an agroforestry situation compared to a pure poplar stand at the \nsame density. An area of the same field at least 15 m from the trees was used as an \narable monocrop area. Starting in 1992, the rotation at Leeds comprised spring barley \n(Hordeum vulgare L.), peas (Pisum sativum L.), two crops of winter wheat (Triticum \naestivum L.), winter barley, spring mustard (Brassica alba L.), winter wheat, winter \nbarley, two winter wheat crops, winter barley and winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus \nL.). At Silsoe, following poor crop yields in the initial three years, there were three \nwinter wheat crops followed by winter beans (Vicia faba L.), spring wheat, winter \nwheat, fallow, winter barley and spring beans. Crop management was the same for \nintercrop and monocrop. The poplar cultivars were Beaupr\u00e9, Gibecq, Trichobel and \nRobusta. From 1992 to 2000 the trees were regularly pruned, by removing the lower \nwhorls of branches, in order to maintain a canopy depth equal to about half the tree \nheight (Burgess et al., 2003).  \n \nMeasurements \nFrom 1992 onwards, the height of each tree in each arable treatment was measured \nafter leaf fall. The diameters of the same trees were measured at breast height (1.3 m \nabove the ground) each winter from 1994 onwards at the Leeds University site at \nBranham and from 1995 onwards at the Cranfield University site at Silsoe. Timber \nvolume was estimated by first assuming the trunk is a perfect cylinder, with a volume \ncalculated from height and diameter, and then multiplying this calculated volume by a \nform factor to account for taper of the trunk (Burgess et al., 2004a). The form factor \nwas derived from poplar yield tables, given in Christie (1994).  \n \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n13\nEach year, grain, bean or pea yield within each poplar-hybrid x arable-treatment plot \nwas determined by harvesting with a plot combine. Corresponding measurements \nwere also taken within the monocropped control area. \n \nModel calibration for poplar and intercrops \nFor the calibration of Yield-SAFE the following approach was used. First, the \npotential growth of monoculture stands of tree and crop species were fitted under \nspecific climatic conditions in Europe, using yield tables for trees (e.g. Thomas et al. \n1998) and validated model calculations for crops (Brisson et al., 2003). Potential \ngrowth is determined foremost by temperature (which drives developmental and \nphenological processes) and radiation (which drives photosynthesis) but is unaffected \nby water and nutrients as these are assumed to be non-limiting under the potential \ngrowth assumption (van Ittersum & Rabbinge, 1997). Second, given actual \nmonoculture yields of tree and crops as \u201creference\u201d yields for a specific experimental \nsite the model was fine-tuned by adjusting \u2013 within physiologically meaningful \nbounds - the transpiration coefficient (\u03b3) and harvest index (HI) and by introducing \u2013 \nif necessary \u2013 a management factor (between 0 and 1) that reduces the radiation use \nefficiency (\u03b5). Hence, yield in agroforestry stands is predicted from the resulting \nmodel, which is \u2013 as described - calibrated to represent site-specific monoculture \nbehaviour of trees and crops as affected by temperature and radiation driven growth \npotential in combination with site specific limitations due to water and nutrients, soil \nproperties, and the local effects of weeds, pest, diseases and management \nshortcomings. \n \nThe calibration of model parameters for the potential growth of poplar trees was \nconducted using published yield tables for unthinned poplar (monoculture) stands \nwith 8 x 8 spacing and a site class of 58 (Thomas et al., 1998). Because timber growth \nis expressed in terms of timber volume, it was necessary to convert the biomass yield \ninto a timber volume. The timber volume of a tree (Vt; m3 tree-1) was derived from: \n \ntimber t\nt\ntimber\nHI BV \u03c1=  [27] \n \nwhere HItimber is the proportion of the total woody-biomass partitioned to timber, and \ntimber\u03c1 is the density of the timber (g m-3). \n \nOn the basis of practical identifiability analysis we decided to estimate the initial \nnumber of shoots, N(t0), and the radiation use efficiency, \u03b5t. Other parameter values \nwere fixed at biologically plausible parameter values, based on literature (see results). \nAttempts to estimate additional parameters led to unreliable results and did not \nimprove the fit. A least-squares optimization algorithm was used to estimate both \nN(t0) and \u03b5t. \n \nAs the crop data available related to harvested crop yield (Yc) rather than crop \nbiomass, it was necessary to assume a crop harvest index (HIc). \n \nc c cHIY B=  [28] \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n14\n \nSimulation data from STICS (Brisson et al., 2003), given appropriate parameters for \nan Atlantic climate was used to provide potential growth curves for winter wheat.  \n \nIn particular, the following parameters were adjusted: \u03b5c, S0 (heat sum after sowing \nwhen crop emerges), S1, S2, Sh (heat sum at harvest) and harvest index HIc. Again, a \nleast-squares optimization was performed to identify the parameter values from the \ndata.  \n \nModel validation for poplar agroforestry systems \nGiven the calibrated parameters related to potential growth, in a second step only \nthree parameters: transpiration coefficient ( t\u03b3 or c\u03b3 ), harvest index (HItimber or HIc) and \na management factor were adjusted to fit actual yields (i.e. locally attained yields; van \nIttersum and Rabbinge, 1997) for the monoculture tree and crop systems at a specific \nsite, in our case Silsoe (UK). The model was then used to predict tree and crop growth \nwithin a silvoarable system using these site-specific parameters, and these results \nwere compared with experimental data collected over 12 years. \n \nSensitivity analysis \nIn this paper the objective of the sensitivity analysis is to investigate how different \nbiophysical parameters influence the land equivalent ratio (LER). The model \nparameters were analyzed by systematically changing their nominal values by adding \n\u00b110%. The nominal values were obtained from the calibration of Yield-SAFE using \nthe procedure described in the previous section. Then, after running the model with \nthe perturbed parameters, the outputs were stored and the sensitivity was calculated \nfrom \n \n( ) ( )\n2\ni i i i\ni i\ny p p y p py\np p\n+ \u2206 \u2212 \u2212 \u2206\u2206 =\u2206 \u2206  [29] \n \nwhere ( )i iy p p+ \u2206 and ( )i iy p p\u2212 \u2206  denote the simulation model output (e.g. LER) \nwhen only the ith parameter is changed up or down by a small amount \u2206pi while \nkeeping the other parameters fixed at their nominal value.

(2007) \n15\nRESULTS \n \nAgroforestry experiments with poplar \nDuring the first 12 years, the UK field experiments showed that poplar tree growth \nwas reduced by the presence of arable crops, rather than a bare-fallow, between the \nrows of poplars (Fig. 2). The effect on timber volume per tree (or equivalently, per \nhectare) was approximately minus 30% after 12 years of poplar growth, both in Silsoe \nand in Leeds. Growth in Silsoe was marginally greater than in Leeds but the effect of \ncrop competition on tree growth was similar at the two sites. During the initial nine \nyears, the mean crop yield in the silvoarable system was 94% of the monoculture \nyield on a cropped area basis, and 75% on a total area basis, after allowing for the \n20% of the area that was uncropped (Fig. 3). After the ninth year, relative crop yields \nstarted to decline substantially due to the cessation of pruning and the development of \nlarge tree canopies. A trend of the resulting LER is provided in Fig. 4, showing \ninitially high values and a decline after nine years. Different ways of calculating LER, \ngive different results. In Fig. 4, LER was calculated according to Equation 3, that is \nby summing relative tree growth in SAF as shown in Fig. 1, and relative crop growth \nin SAF (Fig. 2). Initial calculations (results not shown) indicate that an annual LER, \ncalculated as the sum of annual crop yields (normalized by comparison with \nmonoculture) and the annual increment in timber volume (also normalized by \ncomparison with monoculture) maintained stable values of the order 1.3-1.4 for any \nyear in the experimental period. \n \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nYear\nTi\nm\nbe\nr v\nol\num\ne \npe\nr t\nre\ne \n(m\n3 ) Silsoe monoculture\nLeeds monoculture\nSilsoe agroforestry\nLeeds agroforestry\n \nFigure 2 Growth of poplar in agroforestry stand and monoculture Silsoe (UK) and Leeds (UK), \n1992-2003. \n \n \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al.

(2007) \n18\n \nThe next stage was to calibrate the tree and crop components of the Yield-SAFE \nmodel for the specific conditions of Silsoe. For the tree component, the model was \ncalibrated by assuming a timber volume per tree at the end of the tree rotation, in this \ncase, of 30 years. At Silsoe, the increase in timber volume during the first 12 years \nmatched that of the yield tables provided by Christie (1994) for an 8 m x 8 m poplar \nstand with a maximum mean annual increment of 13 m3 ha-1. Hence from the yield \ntable, a reference timber volume of 2.41 m3 tree-1 was assumed for year 30. Using the \nYield-SAFE model, and meteorological and soils data for Silsoe, the values of the \ntranspiration coefficient and the harvest index were modified (Table 2) so that the \nmodel predicted a timber yield of 2.41 m3 tree-1 in year 30 (Fig. 7). The tree growth \npredicted by Yield-SAFE lags somewhat behind during early tree growth; this may \npartly be due to the assumption of a constant harvest index. \n \nA continuous rotation of winter wheat was assumed for the crop component of the \nagroforestry system and a reference yield of 8.23 t ha-1 was derived from regional \nfarm surveys. To obtain such a mean value over 30 years, it was necessary to modify \nthe transpiration coefficient for the wheat to 0.316 m2 kg-1 (Table 2), which is within \nthe plausible range for temperate conditions. It was not necessary to modify the \nharvest index. Thus, the model was calibrated to a site-specific reference yield using \neco-physiologically meaningful values for all the parameters. This is evidence that the \nmodel structure is eco-physiologically appropriate. \n \n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n0 10 20 30\nTi\nm\nbe\nr v\nol\num\ne \n(m\n3 \/t\nre\ne)\nYield-SAFE forestry\nSilsoe forestry measured\nSilsoe forestry predicted YC=13\n \nFigure 7 Calibration of Yield-SAFE: Model prediction of tree growth in a poplar agro-forestry \nstand, compared to yield tables (YC 13; Christie, 1994) and tree growth in the forestry treatment \nat Silsoe (1992-2003). \n \nTable 2 Reference yields and calibrated values for transpiration coefficient and harvest index for \npoplar and wheat at Silsoe.

The predicted relative crop yields for the first twelve years (Fig. 8) generally \nmatched the experimental results. This match between data and simulation results in \nthe agroforestry situation provides further evidence for the validity for the modelling \nconcept and calibration philosophy. Remember that the model was not fitted to any \ndata from the agroforestry stand, but only to data from pure stands of crops or trees. \nThus, the rather good fit of the model to the yields in an actual agroforestry \nexperiment provides evidence that it correctly captures the essence of the crop-tree \ninteractions. \n \n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n0 10 20 30\nTime from tree planting (a)\nR\nel\nat\niv\ne \ncr\nop\n y\nie\nld\nArable\nSilvoarable\nSilsoe\nLeeds\n \nFig. 8: Validation of Yield-SAFE: model prediction of relative yield of continuous winter wheat, \ncompared with monoculture wheat yield, in a poplar agroforestry stand (156 trees ha-1), \ncompared to observed relative crop yields in Silsoe and Leeds agroforestry experiments, 1992-\n2004 (open symbols). \n \nSensitivity analysis \nUsing the Yield-SAFE model it was possible to predict the LER over a tree rotation of \n30 years, using Equation 2. Assuming a continuous rotation of wheat the predicted \nLER, at the end of the tree rotation of after 30 years, was 1.34. Perturbations of plus \nor minus 10% in the parameters used for this analysis resulted in values of LER \nranging from 1.30 to 1.39 (Table 3). Thus, LER estimates by Yield-SAFE are \nmoderately robust to parameter inaccuracies. The parameters kt, \u03b5t, N(t0) and Am had \nthe greatest relative effect on LER (cf. Keesman et al., 2005). These tree parameters \ndefine to a large extent the shading of the tree on the crop. \n \nA sensitivity analysis (Dennis & Schnabel, 1983) was also undertaken to determine \nhow the elasticity of the LER to specific parameters changed during the tree rotation \nand with the light extinction coefficient. For this analysis, LER in a specific year was \ndetermined using Equation 3. The default parameter sets, with varying values for the \ntree light extinction coefficient are given in Table 4. The results from both datasets \nmatched the tree and crop growth during the first 12 years of the agroforestry stand, \nbut resulted in a long term overestimation of tree growth, compared to yield tables of \nChristie (1994). No water limitation was taken into account.  \n \nAs a result of the different choice of nominal kt in the two parameter sets, different \nvalues are obtained for other parameters, notably those that affect the early growth of \nthe tree: \u03b5t and the initial number of shoots, N(t0).

The importance of the tree parameters in \ndetermining the complementarity of resource use, as expressed by the value of LER, \nis also shown in a mathematical analysis by Keesman et al. (2005). Complementarity \nunder potential growing conditions is entirely the result of the tree leaf canopy \ntransmitting light that can be utilized by the crop component in the system. The \nmaximum number of branches of the tree (Nm) has very low elasticity initially, but \ngains in importance as the trees grow. For mature trees, the maximum amount of \nshading by trees is determined in part by Nm; hence this parameter influences LER in \na mature stand more than in a young stand.  \n \n \nThe crop\u2019s partitioning coefficient to leaves showed large sensitivity during the early \nyears of the tree rotation. Surprisingly, some crop parameters attained greater relative \nimportance to LER during the late years (20 and 25) of the tree rotation. For instance, \nin year 25, when the maximum number of shoots is (almost) achieved and the shade is \nsevere and the contribution of crop growth to LER small, the crop parameters light \nextinction (kc) coefficient and light use efficiency (\u03b5c) still become important. This is \nbecause, due to the large leaf area of the tree leaf canopy, changing the value of kt by \na factor 0.002 (0.2 %) has only a small effect on the amount of light available for the \ncrop. Given the shade condition, a small change (0.2 %) of the value of P, kc and \u03b5c \n(responsible for light interception and light use efficiency by the crop) has an impact \non crop growth and LER. The effect is clearest at the greater nominal value of tree \nlight interception (kt = 0.8; Table 5). \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n22\nTable 5.

In support of \nthis approach the following arguments can be given: a simpler model is often easier to \nparameterise and may produce more robust results; it is less work to build; and it is \neasier to explain and understand. This results in a shorter learning curve when the \nmodel is used in upscaling studies, and this may favour its inclusion in higher level \nstudies, e.g. explorations of land use. Of course, a simple model may be \nunderparameterised and unable to represent real situations using the few equations \nthat were chosen as essential. We have not encountered data sets in which this is the \ncase. This model was built with the philosophy that it could be extended when \nsimulation of realistic situations required further detailing. This might be necessary, \nfor instance, when agroforestry at different nutrient levels and nutrient limitation is \nsimulated. However, the current set of parameters can represent many realistic \nsituations without expanding the set of variables or equations, by simply adjusting \nvalues of parameters to specific conditions. For instance, the effect of nutrient \nlimitation on growth rates can be captured in the value of the light efficiencies \u03b5c and \n\u03b5t. Our philosophy with Yield-SAFE is that the model should keep its present simple \nstructure until it is unable to represent real situations due to lack of structure or \ndegrees of freedom. In this sense we follow Peters\u2019 (1991) plea for simple, useful and \npredictive models in ecology. \n \n Yield-SAFE  van der Werf et al. (2007) \n23\nIn the current model version, the leaf area of the trees was assumed to spread out over \nthe whole of the agroforested area, without explicitly accounting for clumping of tree \nleaf area in the tree crowns. Reasoning from existing literature on light distribution in \ncrops (e.g. Goudriaan & van Laar, 1994) indicates that the extinction coefficient \nmight change at low tree densities as the canopy is more heterogeneous. Initial use of \nthe model has suggested that it may be necessary to modify the light extinction \ncoefficient in such situations. An alternative approach is to use detailed models on \nlight distribution (e.g. Pronk et al., 2002) to estimate parameters for Yield-SAFE. \nLikewise, detailed models for root distribution and activity in agroforestry might be \nused to parameterize Yield-SAFE functions for water capture by crops and trees. \n \nDuring the same project an elaborate model was built for agroforestry system \nperformance, based on details of resource use processes in agroforestry systems. This \nmodel is called Hi-SAFE to indicate the high level of process detail contained in it. \nThe applications of Hi-SAFE are more geared towards shorter time scales, and \ndetailed questions regarding spatial configuration in agroforestry designs, whereas \nYield-SAFE focuses on issues of production and resource use in the longer term. For \nboth models, parameter estimation is an issue. Yield-SAFE requires long term data on \ntree growth for parameter estimation and validation of model results. Such data are \nnot yet available for agroforestry systems, but they may become available in the \nfuture as the experiments that have been planted in the 1990s mature and accumulate \ntimber. It is quite important that minimal data are collected in such experiments to \nallow estimation of parameters of the model proposed here. In this respect it would be \nvery helpful if records were taken of leaf area index and\/or soil cover by the crop as \nwell as the trees at different times during the season. Moreover, allometric \nrelationships for widely-spaced trees are needed. At the present time, for studies on \nfuture land use, there is a pressing need for models that can be built with the limited \ninformation on agroforestry that is now available, as very few agroforestry systems \nhave yet been planted in Europe. A simple model like Yield-SAFE can play a pivotal \nrole in land use explorations by predicting production in agroforestry systems by \nintegrating the vast information on forestry and arable systems, based on well proven \neco-physiological principles, that \u2013 as this study shows \u2013 hold up as well in \nagroforestry as in agriculture and forestry. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThe research presented here was carried out as part of the collaborative research \nproject SAFE: Silvoarable Agroforestry for Europe. Support for SAFE was provided \nby the Quality of Life Programme of the European Union (contract number QLK5-\nCT-2001-00560). The silvoarable experiments in the UK were conducted with support \nfrom, what is now, the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. \n \nREFERENCES \nBrisson, N., C. Gary, E.
