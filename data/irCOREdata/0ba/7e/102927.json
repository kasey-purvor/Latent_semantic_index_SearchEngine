R5.2Background\nStreptomycetes represent an unusual and complex bacterial\ngenus. They display a mycelial 'multicellular' life cycle that\nculminates in sporulation [1] and possess remarkable meta-\nbolic diversity, both in their ability to catabolise complex sub-\nstrates and in their prodigious capacity to produce chemically\ndiverse 'secondary' metabolites, including the majority of nat-\nurally occurring antibiotics and other bioactive compounds\nused in medicine [2,3]. These characteristics form the major\njustification for basic studies of streptomycete biology. Since\nthe completion of the genome sequence of the principal\nmodel streptomycete, Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) [4],\nnumerous systems-level studies have been initiated, encom-\npassing transcriptomic\/proteomic approaches and genome\nscale metabolic network construction [5-8].\nTo date, Streptomyces DNA microarray-based studies have\nbeen restricted largely to the use of spotted PCR products or\npre-synthesized long oligonucleotides, with a single probe\nrepresenting each gene [9]. Such arrays are not generally suit-\nable for genome wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-\nchip (ChIP-on-chip) analysis of transcription factor binding\nsites [10]. The ChIP-on-chip technique has become an essen-\ntial tool for system wide analysis of biological systems (for\nexample, [11-15]) since it provides a comprehensive assess-\nment of the direct targets, in vivo, of the transcription factor\/\nDNA-binding protein under investigation; this is a pre-requi-\nsite for reconstructing cellular transcription regulatory net-\nworks. Here we report the development of ink-jet in situ\nsynthesized (IJISS) DNA arrays for ChIP-on-chip analysis of\nS. coelicolor.\nStreptomycetes are unusual in possessing genomes of very\nhigh G+C content. The S. coelicolor genome is 72.4% G+C\nand individual coding sequences often exceed 80% G+C. This\nextreme base composition compromises the design of suita-\nble probes for array-based detection of complementary\nnucleic acid sequences because G+C-rich probes often\nhybridize poorly with targets or they display a lack of specifi-\ncity. Consequently, in this study we adopted an experimental\napproach to test a large collection of arrayed probes for sensi-\ntivity and specificity prior to selecting a subset for the final\ngenome arrays. The objective was to produce a versatile\nexperimentally optimized array that could be used for both\ngenome-wide ChIP-on-chip analysis and global gene expres-\nsion profiling.\nThe HspR heat-shock regulatory system of S. coelicolor [6]\nwas exploited to test and validate the sensitivity and specifi-\ncity of the IJISS arrays. HspR was selected because it repre-\nsents a well-characterized repressor with a small number of\nknown targets. Streptomycetes have adopted diverse strate-\ngies to rapidly adjust to sudden changes in the environment,\nfor example, from heat stress or other physico-chemical and\nphysiological stresses. As in all living organisms, they induce\nexpression of many genes in response to heat stress, including\nthe well characterized and universally conserved members of\nthe hsp70 (dnaK) and hsp60 (groEL) gene families (see [16-\n18] for reviews). In Streptomyces and most Gram-positive\nand Gram-negative bacteria the heat shock stimulon is under\nthe control of negative transcriptional regulators [19], unlike\nEscherichia coli where the heat shock stimulon is under the\npositive regulation of the alternative sigma factors \u03c332 and \u03c324\n[20,21]. The heat shock stimulon mostly comprises two major\nclasses of genes encoding, respectively, molecular chaperones\nand proteases that are induced under conditions that cause\nprotein misfolding\/denaturation in order to maintain protein\nquality control, or eliminate protein aggregates or badly dam-\naged proteins that would otherwise have a deleterious effect\non cell survival.\nThree negative transcriptional regulators have been charac-\nterized in Streptomyces species: HrcA, controlling the\ngroES\/EL1 operon and groEL2 (for a review, see [22]); RheA\ncontrolling hsp18 in Staphylococcus albus [23,24]; and HspR\ncontrolling the dnaK operon, clpB molecular chaperone and\nlon protease-encoding genes [25-27].\nThe HspR repressor has since been identified in some other\nbacterial systems: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, where it con-\ntrols the expression of the hsp70 operon, clpB and acr2 genes\n[28]; and Corynebacterium glutamicum [29], where it con-\ntrols the clpP1\/P2 operon together with two other regulators,\nClgR and \u03c3H. Furthermore, the HspR system has been\nreported in other bacteria not belonging to the Actinomyc-\netales family, such as the Gram-negative Helicobacter pylori,\nwhere HspR functions in conjunction with HrcA to regulate\nthe groES\/EL and hrcA-dnaK-grpE operons [30-32], Deino-\ncoccus radiodurans, where HspR controls two novel mem-\nbers of the regulon (hsp20 and ftsH) in addition to known\nmembers such as dnaK, dnaJ, grpE, lonB and clpB [33], Bifi-\ndobacterium breve [34] and Campylobacter jejuni [35].\nIn the present study we have optimized methods for chroma-\ntin immunoprecipitation and have produced optimized high\ndensity arrays for ChIP-on-chip analysis of S. coelicolor. Here\nwe exploit this technology (to our knowledge applied for the\nfirst time with Streptomyces) to redefine the HspR regulon of\nS. coelicolor. The microarray design allows gene expression\ndata to be superimposed for the same probes, enabling dis-\ncrimination between indirect effects of either over-expressing\nor disrupting a regulator gene from the direct effect resulting\nfrom the in vivo binding of the respective regulator to its tar-\nget genes. In addition to confirming dnaK, clpB and lon as in\nvivo targets of HspR, the ChIP-on-chip studies reported here\nindicate that HspR also has a role in regulation of expression\nof ribosomal RNA and specific transfer RNA genes, for incor-\nporation of Gln and Glu, the latter potentially linked with\ntetrapyrrole biosynthesis. This suggests that HspR fulfils a\nbroader role in adaptation to stresses, such as heat-shock,\nthan was previously recognized - influencing expression of\nkey components of the translational apparatus in addition toGenome Biology 2009, 10:R5\nhttp:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2009\/10\/1\/R5 Genome Biology 2009,     Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R5       Bucca et al. R5.3major molecular chaperone and protease-encoding genes. It\nis envisaged that these IJISS arrays will find wide application\nin systems level studies of Streptomyces biology.\nResults and discussion\nDNA microarray design\nTwo different S. coelicolor IJISS DNA microarrays were\ndesigned, featuring, respectively, 22,000 (Sco-Chip2-v1) and\n44,000 (Sco-Chip2-v2) 60-mer oligonucleotide probes. In\neach case the same experimental optimization approach was\nused (Figure 1) where a large set (approximately 1 million) of\n60-mer probes were printed in parallel with corresponding\nprobes that had a 3-nucleotide mismatch. Cyanine-3 (Cy3)\nand Cyanine-5 (Cy5)-labeled S. coelicolor genomic DNA was\nhybridized against the test arrays and the probe performance\nwas scored using the following equations. Firstly the Cy3 and\nCy5 background-subtracted signals, designated 'g' and 'r',\nrespectively, obtained by feature extraction of the arrays\nusing the Agilent feature extraction software (Version 9.1.3.1)\nwere entered into the following formula:\nA = (gMM\/gPM + rMM\/rPM)\/2\nwhere the signal from the perfectly matched probe is desig-\nnated 'PM' while that from the corresponding mismatched\nprobe is designated 'MM'. For values of A greater than 1, A\nwas set to 1 before entering it into the second equation:\nR = [1 - arctan (A \u00d7 \u03c0\/2)] \u00d7 [1 - exp(- (gPM + rPM)\/2000)]\nThe resulting R-value was used to rank all tested probes. The\nhigher the value, the better the probe performance. This\nmethod of ranking probes was developed within Oxford Gene\nTechnology Ltd and has been applied to various prokaryotic\norganisms for empirical microarray probe design.\nSets of probes within a defined region, either gene or inter-\ngenic, were ranked. All probes were considered relative to\neach other without applying thresholds and the desired den-\nsity of probe coverage was achieved by selecting top-ranked\nprobes where possible. Performing the above experimental\noptimization approach is, in our opinion, a necessary step,\ngiven that approximately 40% of the in silico designed probes\nfailed quality control. Sufficient probe coverage was obtained\nusing fewer than 5% of probes ranked below the median value\nof the ranking distribution. The remaining 95% of the opti-\nmized probe set were picked from probes performing above\naverage with a strong bias for very well performing probes.\nFor both array formats the probes were deposited at random\npositions on the slide surfaces to minimize the risk of any\nposition-specific artifacts.\nSco-Chip2-v1 array\nAll possible 60-mer probes for all targets (both coding and\nnon-coding sequences) in the S. coelicolor genome (based on\nthe S. coelicolor A3(2) [EMBL:AL645882.2]) were designed.\nFor this version of the array all non-coding sequences\nupstream of protein-encoding genes were selected (sequences\nwhere transcription factors are most likely to bind) and mul-\ntiple 60-mer probes targeting those regions were selected\nfrom the 'all possible probes' set. Following this initial selec-\ntion, a total of 84,268 probes were experimentally tested and\nthe best performing 21,064 probes that represented all\nupstream intergenic regions (an average of 3 approximately\n110 bp spaced probes to each upstream site) in the genome\nwere synthesized on the array.

The average spacing of probes in the\ngenome was approximately 135 bp.\nGenome-wide identification of in vivo HspR binding \nsites\nThe experimentally optimized Sco-Chip2-v1 and Sco-Chip2-\nv2 arrays were used consecutively to identify in vivo targets of\nHspR. The latter array was designed to also enable quantifi-\ncation of gene expression. In order to validate the sensitivity\nand specificity of these arrays, we chose the well-studied tran-\nscriptional repressor HspR, which was previously known to\nbind to only three promoter regions in the genome of S. coeli-\ncolor: upstream of the dnaK operon; the protease-encoding\ngene lon; and the clpB gene, which is transcribed in an operon\nwith SCO3660. These results were based on transcriptome\nanalysis of an hspR disruption mutant and complementary in\nsilico genome wide searches for HspR binding sites [6].\nFor the ChIP-on-chip experiments, samples of S. coelicolor\ncultures at early stationary phase were treated with formalde-\nhyde and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) as described\nin Materials and methods. For these experiments, S. coeli-\ncolor was cultivated under non-heat-shock conditions in a\nrich liquid medium containing 10.3% sucrose to support dis-\npersed growth of the mycelium and provide sufficient bio-\nmass for the ChIP protocol; this was to maximize\nformaldehyde penetration and to determine the genomic dis-\ntribution of HspR under non-stressed conditions (the 'rest-\ning' state). Following the IP reaction, the DNA was recovered,\nlabeled with Cy3-dCTP and then co-hybridized onto the Sco-\nChip2-v1 and Sco-Chip2-v2 arrays together with the Cy5-\ndCTP-labeled total chromatin as reference (Sco-Chip2-v1) or\nwith Cy5-dCTP labeled mock 'no-antibody' IP chromatin\n(Sco-Chip2-v2) (see Materials and methods). The results pre-\nsented in Figures 2 and 3 (and Additional data file 3) repre-\nsent the average of two biological replicates. They confirm\nthat HspR does bind, in vivo, to the dnaK, clpB and lon pro-\nmoter regions and, importantly, have served to identify addi-\ntional putative HspR targets. The statistical approaches used\nto score probe enrichment ratios (gene targets) as significant\ndiffered between the two array formats because in Sco-Chip2-\nv1 the probes were focused only on promoter regions while in\nSco-Chip2-v2 the probes were relatively evenly spaced across\nthe genome (see Materials and methods). The targets scored\nas significant using Sco-Chip2-v1 were dnaK, clpB, lon and\nSCO5639 and those on Sco-Chip2-v2 were dnaK, clpB, lon\nand probe sequences between SCO3019-SCO3020 and\nSCO5549-SCO5550, corresponding, respectively, to the pro-\nmoter region of the rrnD ribosomal RNA operon and a five-\ntRNA cluster encoding tRNAGln and tRNAGlu species; if the\ncut-off threshold was slightly relaxed for the Sco-Chip2-v2\ndata, then SCO5639 was also identified.\nThe respective nucleotide sequences of the new putative sta-\nble RNA targets of HspR had been excluded from Sco-Chip2-\nv1 because they are non-protein-coding and are positioned\nbetween convergently transcribed genes. The discovery that\nHspR may regulate specific tRNA and rRNA genes is unprec-\nedented and suggests a more global role for HspR in the stress\nHspR-mediated enrichment of array probes across the S. coelicolor genomeFigure 2\nHspR-mediated enrichment of array probes across the S. \ncoelicolor genome.

The HspR-specific probe enrich-\nments in the previously known and the new putative HspR\ntargets are shown in Figure 3 (and Additional data file 3).\nThe heat-shock stimulon of S. coelicolor\nThe versatility of the Sco-Chip2-v2 design allowed us to detect\ngene expression using the same probe set. Thus, in Figure 3\nthe expression data from two pairs of comparisons are also\nsuperimposed on the ChIP enrichment data: the ratio of\nexpression from hspR disruption mutants relative to the wild-\ntype strain; and the ratio of expression from cultures heat-\nshocked at 42\u00b0C relative to non-heat-shocked control cul-\ntures. It is noted that the observed reduction of relative tran-\nscript levels of operonic genes more distal from the operon\npromoter (as in the dnaK operon; Figure 3a) is consistent\nwith general observations of polarity of expression of Strepto-\nmyces operons [36].\nThe gene expression studies were conducted using RNA sam-\nples from strains cultivated on supplemented minimal\nmedium agar plates, rather than rich liquid medium. This was\nfor several reasons. First, the magnitude of the heat-shock\nresponse is relatively lower and less reproducible in heat-\nshocked mycelium cultivated in the rich YEME+10.3%\nsucrose liquid medium, compared with the heat-shock\nresponse of the surface-grown minimal medium cultures.\nSecond, the hspR disruption mutants used in this study are\nunstable because hspR is an essential gene [6,27]. The disrup-\ntion of hspR is via a single integration event of a non-replicat-\ning plasmid and there is a strong selective pressure for its\nexcision. Thus, in liquid culture the mycelium in which the\ndisruption plasmid has excised outgrows the mutant myc-\nelium, which is at a growth disadvantage, leading to a domi-\nnant wild-type revertant phenotype. In surface-grown\ncultures this reversion is markedly attenuated, where a low\nfrequency of reversion maintains viability. Third, the RNA\nsamples used here for comparison with the ChIP data have\nbeen extensively validated by other methods [6,27]. The\nabove experiment allowed, for the first time, a comprehensive\nidentification of the heat-shock stimulon of S. coelicolor at\nthe transcriptome level, where rank products analysis\nrevealed 119 up-regulated genes (based on a probability of\nfalse prediction (pfp) threshold of <0.15 (see Materials and\nmethods)) as a result of heat-shock (Additional data file 4).\nThe use of such thresholds has been reported elsewhere\n[7,37].\nTwo genes on the heat-shock list with relatively high pfp val-\nues (SCO3202, pfp = 0.12; SCO4157, pfp = 0.13) were selected\nfor independent validation by quantitative real time PCR\n(qPCR) to confirm true heat-shock induction (Additional data\nfile 9); furthermore, SCO3660, a known member of the HspR\nregulon [6], had a pfp value of 0.12. This justified the use of\nthe pfp threshold adopted here. The significantly up-regu-\nlated heat shock genes include all members of the dnaK\noperon, clpB, lon and the chaperonin-encoding groES-\ngroEL1 operon and groEL2. Two more protease-encoding\ngenes are also present in the heat-shock list: SCO4157, encod-\ning the homologue of E. coli HtrA, a serine protease involved\nin degradation of periplasmic misfolded proteins, and\nSCO6515. Notably, eight oxidoreductase-encoding genes are\npresent, some of them being strongly up-regulated by heat-\nshock and transcribed in an operon (SCO1131-SCO1134). The\noperon encoding different subunits of the nitrate reductase\n(SCO0216-SCO0219) and the nitrite\/nitrate transporter-\nencoding gene SCO0213 are also heat-inducible together with\nthe principal 'gas vesicle protein'-encoding operon\n(SCO6499-SCO6508) [38], the cytochrome oxidase-encoding\ngenes SCO3945-SCO3946 and two genes of sigE operon (sigE\n(SCO3356) and the lipoprotein-encoding gene cseA\n(SCO3357)) [39]. It is of interest that more than 10% of the\nheat-shock-induced genes (14) encode transcriptional regula-\ntors and included SCO0174 (the most induced), five sigma\nfactors (HrdD (SCO3202), SigB (SCO0600), SigE (SCO3356),\nSigL (SCO7278) and SigM (SCO7314)) and an anti-sigma fac-\ntor antagonist (SCO7325). A separate, complementary analy-\nsis of the heat-shock response in wild-type S. coelicolor\ncultivated under identical conditions in YEME to those used\nfor the ChIP-on-chip studies demonstrated that most of the\nabove 119 heat-shock induced genes (102\/119) were also heat-\ninduced in the YEME medium (Additional data file 11); how-\never, the level of induction of the well-known molecular chap-\nerone-encoding genes was attenuated relative to the surface\ngrown SMMS cultures. It is interesting to note that 16 of the\n17 genes not heat-induced in the YEME cultures are clustered\nin a discrete region at the left end of the chromosome between\nSCO162 and SCO219; this may reflect the differences in the\nwidely different nutritional compositions of the two growth\nmedia and these genes may require additional transcription\nfactors for their induction.\nThe list of 55 genes significantly up-regulated in an hspR dis-\nruption mutant relative to the wild-type is presented in Addi-\ntional data file 5 (cut-off pfp < 0.15). It includes all previously\nknown members of the HspR regulon and other notable genes\nthat, on the basis of the ChIP-on-chip analysis, are not con-\nsidered to be directly controlled by HspR; their induction\ncould be a consequence of the up-regulation of molecular\nchaperone or protease-encoding gene expression in the HspR\nmutant. Genes for five putative transcriptional regulators are\nrepresented in the list.\nNew putative targets of HspR\nThe sensitivity of the IJISS arrays was deduced to be high\nsince all previously known HspR targets were identified on\nboth array designs. SCO5639 was not identified as belonging\nto the HspR regulon in a previous study [6]. SCO5639\nencodes a hypothetical protein of 176 amino acids in length\nand, unusually for streptomycete genes, has a low G+C con-\ntent (approximately 53%) and is flanked by genes also of low\nG+C content: SCO5638 (55% G+C), which encodes an inte-\ngral membrane protein, and SCO5640 (54% G+C), whichGenome Biology 2009, 10:R5\nhttp:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2009\/10\/1\/R5 Genome Biology 2009,     Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R5       Bucca et al. R5.7encodes a hypothetical protein. Moreover, the adjacent gene,\nSCO5641, encodes a putative transposase, suggesting that\nSCO5639 could have been laterally acquired recently. Pfam\n[40] searches of the deduced amino acid sequence of\nSCO5639 returned the 'domain of unknown function'\nDUF1863, corresponding to a domain that adopts the 'flavo-\ndoxin fold' with \"a probable role in signal transduction as a\nphosphorylation-independent conformational switch pro-\ntein\". Other proteins that contain this domain (37 known in\ntotal, including another actinomycete, Corynebacterium effi-\nciens) are also uncharacterized. Similarly, blastp [41,42]\nresults identified further hypotheticals (at E-value < 1e-10) and\nfound a similarity, albeit low (35% identity), to the phospho-\nrylation site of the calcineurin temperature suppressor (Cts1)\nof Cryptococcus neoformans (a yeast), which is responsible\nfor restoring growth of calcineurin mutant strains at 37\u00b0C\namong other functions such as cell separation and hyphal\nelongation [43]. This link with temperature would be consist-\nent with SCO5639 being a target of HspR.\nThe HspR binding motif\nIn previous work the minimal consensus operator for HspR\nbinding, generated by the alignment of upstream sequences\nof clpB, lon and dnaK, was documented as 5'-TTGAG-\nYNNNNNNNACTCAA [6]. A MEME (Maximum Em for Motif\nElicitation) alignment (see Materials and methods) of the\nupstream sequences of these three genes and SCO5639 pro-\nduced a modified consensus sequence of 5'-TKGARTNN-\nNYNNRAYTCA (Figure 4). This new consensus sequence was\nused to search the S. coelicolor genome using RSAT [44,45]\nwith default settings; five matches were found, SCO4410 and\nthe above four genes.\nIn vitro analysis of new HspR targets\nGel shift assays were conducted using DNA sequences\nupstream of the dnaK operon as a positive control [26] (data\nnot shown), SCO5639 and SCO4410. The results indicate that\nHspR binds in vitro to the putative HspR motifs of SCO5639\nand SCO4410 (Figure 5). However, a convincing gel-shift was\nonly obtained for SCO5639 and SCO4410 with the HspR-con-\ntaining E. coli cell extracts and not with the purified, refolded,\nHspR, suggesting that additional factors might be required\nfor an efficient binding\/stabilization of HspR at the SCO5639\nand SCO4410 promoters; such factors would need to have a\ncounterpart in E. coli to explain these results. An alternative\nexplanation could be that the HspR-DnaK complex in the\nSCO5639 and SCO4410 promoter regions is weaker and that\nthis binding is not necessarily responsible for modulating\nheat-shock regulation of these genes. Expression of these two\ngenes following heat-shock and in a hspR disruption mutant\nwas assessed by qPCR (Additional data files 9 and 10).\nSCO5639 was only modestly heat-induced (by 23%) but,\nimportantly, it was up-regulated approximately fivefold in a\nhspR disruption mutant. It is possible that SCO5639 is co-\nregulated by other factors that are not influenced directly by\nheat.

R5.8approximately 3-fold by heat-shock and it was up-regulated\napproximately 15-fold in a hspR disruption mutant. On the\nbasis of these results, SCO4410 and SCO5639 are considered\nto be genuine targets of HspR. The SCO4410 gene, which is\npredicted to encode an anti-anti-sigma factor was not identi-\nfied in the ChIP-on-chip experiments. It is known that false\nnegatives occur in such studies and they are considered to\narise due to sequestration of the transcription factor in nucle-\noprotein complexes, rendering them inaccessible to the spe-\ncific test antibody used for the IP reaction; it should be noted\nthat one of the best studied protein-DNA complexes, the\nCRP-lac promoter complex of E. coli, was not identified in\nChIP-on-chip analysis of CRP binding in E. coli [12].\nStable RNA genes as putative targets for HspR\nThe observation that HspR appears to bind to the promoter\nregion of the rrnD operon and to multiple sequences within\nthe five-tRNAGln\/Glu cluster is unprecedented. Other than the\npreviously known HspR targets, these were the only two\nregions identified as statistically significant by the data clus-\ntering method reported in this study for the Sco-Chip2-v2-\nderived data. Previous studies would not have identified sta-\nble RNA genes as potential targets because representative\nprobes had not been printed on the arrays. Furthermore, the\ntypical 'transcription factor binding site' consensus sequence\nidentification technique is based on searching the upstream\nregions of protein-encoding genes and\/or a set threshold is\napplied in silico, which may not be able to simulate the true in\nvivo binding that occurs. Indeed, the in silico analysis carried\nout in this study (discussed in Materials and methods),\nrevealed only partial recognition of the defined HspR consen-\nsus (Additional data file 6) whilst the in vivo data (ChIP-on-\nchip enrichment ratios) indicate HspR binding. Thus, it is\nlikely that other transcription factors also bind to these\nregions, or that other DNA sequences facilitate HspR-bind-\ning, and it is possible that such factors could positively influ-\nence the binding of HspR, relieving its dependence on a\nsubstantial consensus sequence match. In this context it is\nnotable that the most highly enriched probes flank both the\nbeginnings and ends of the rrnD operon and five-tRNA clus-\nter (Figure 3d,e, respectively); it is conceivable that HspR\nforms a looped complex at both of these stable RNA-encoding\nregions. A MEME analysis (see Materials and methods)\nrevealed a non-palindromic motif shared between the HspR\ntargets identified with the Sco-Chip2-v2 array (Additional\ndata file 7); the biological significance of this motif is not\nclear.\nHspR regulates the DnaK chaperone machine, a system that\nplays an important role in the cotranslational folding of pro-\nteins [46] in addition to assisting folding of unfolded or par-\ntially unfolded mature polypeptides. It could be rationalized\nthat HspR inactivation also facilitates expression of rRNA\nand tRNAs following heat-shock, or other stresses, as part of\nthe transient adaptive response to environmental stresses.\nFrom the gene expression analysis (Figure 3; Additional data\nfiles 14 and 15) there is a detectable enhancement (albeit\nsmall) of rrnD and tRNAGln\/Glu transcript levels in heat-\nshocked cultures and in an hspR disruption mutant; a high\nover-representation would not be expected because these\nparticular stable RNA genes are highly expressed under nor-\nmal growth conditions (data not shown) and a transient\n(approximately 15 minute) induction of one of the rRNA\noperons would not have a major impact on the large pre-exist-\ning pool of these stable species within the cytoplasm. From\naveraging of signals from the multiple probes in this region,\nthe increase in the rrnD 16S rRNA transcript level was \u2265 10%\nfollowing heat-shock and \u2265 20% in an hspR disruption\nmutant. We suggest that HspR-mediated control of rrnD\ntranscription facilitates the maintenance of rRNA transcrip-\ntion following heat-shock. There are precedents for heat-\nstimulated transcription of rRNA operons in both Streptomy-\nces and E. coli. Le\u00f3n and Mellado demonstrated partial heat-\nshock stimulation of some rRNA promoters in the closely\nrelated species S. lividans [47]. In E. coli the heat-shock\nsigma factor \u03c332 was shown to direct transcription of the rrnB\nP1 promoter and the authors suggest that \u03c332-directed tran-\nscription of rRNA promoters might play a role in ribosome\nsynthesis at high temperatures [48]. There are also reports of\ndevelopmental regulation of rRNA and ribosomal protein\nsynthesis in S. coelicolor [49,50]. The upstream region of\nrrnD of S. coelicolor displays significant differences from that\nof other rRNA promoters in this genome (S. coelicolor con-\ntains six rrn operons). In this context it is of relevance that a\nrecent study suggests that the p3 and p4 promoters of rrnD\nGel-shift assays of putative new HspR targets: SCO5639 and SCO4410Figure 5\nGel-shift assays of putative new HspR targets: SCO5639 and \nSCO4410.

R5.9are differentially regulated by additional (as yet unidentified)\nfactors [51]. It is tempting to speculate that HspR-mediated\ninduction of rrnD transcription may result in the production\nof a subset of ribosomes with a specific role in translation of\nstress-responsive proteins.\nTransient stimulation of transcription of the tRNAGln\/Glu clus-\nter may lead to an enhancement in the cellular level of\nuncharged tRNAs - particularly since Gln-tRNAGln formation\nrequires transamidation of Glu-tRNAGln [52]. In this context\nit might be relevant that the tRNAGln\/Glu cluster encodes the\nonly two tRNAGln species in S. coelicolor and the transient\naccumulation of uncharged tRNAs is known to be a major\ntrigger for the stringent response [53].\nMost organisms contain only one Glu-tRNAGlu species [54].\nThe tRNAGln\/Glu cluster identified in this study encodes three\nGlu-tRNAGlu species (recognizing the GAG codon); one other\nGlu-tRNAGlu gene is encoded elsewhere in the S. coelicolor\ngenome and recognizes the GAA codon, which is a very rarely\nused streptomycete codon. Glu-tRNAGlu has two major roles\nin the cell. In addition to its role in protein synthesis, Glu-\ntRNAGlu is a substrate in the first step of tetrapyrrole biosyn-\nthesis, to produce heme, for example [54,55]. Inspection of\nthe predicted protein products from the S. coelicolor genome\nindicates that this is the only available route for tetrapyrrole\nbiosynthesis in this organism. It is possible, therefore, that\nthere is an enhanced requirement for tetrapyrrole production\nfollowing heat-shock (and concomitant oxidative stress), to\nprovide heme, for example, for cytochrome biosynthesis and\nfor catalase and superoxide dismutase production and this\ncould be achieved by HspR-mediated regulation of Glu-tRNA-\nGlu expression.\nAn additional possible explanation for enhanced expression\nof this sub-set of tRNAs could be that there is a higher tran-\nsient demand for Gln and Glu in protein synthesis immedi-\nately following heat-shock. Transcript levels of two of the five\ntRNA species was enhanced approximately 10% in hspR dis-\nruptants (Figure 3; Additional data file 15). Indeed, the Gln\/\nGlu frequency (the percentage of Gln\/Glu codons in a codon\nset) in the heat-shock up-regulated gene set (Additional data\nfile 4) is higher than that obtained for the entire genome\n(9.76% versus 8.32%). To estimate the significance of this\nfinding, 10,000 random subsets of genes from the entire\ngenome, of the same size as the up-regulated gene list, were\ncreated and their Gln\/Glu frequency was calculated. It was\nfound (through the use of the Z-score) that the heat-shock up-\nregulated gene set had an enhanced Gln\/Glu codon frequency\ncompared to any of the random sets, yielding a significance p-\nvalue of < 1.06 \u00d7 10-7. It is concluded that there is statistically\nsignificant enrichment of Gln\/Glu codons in the heat-shock\nup-regulated genes and we speculate that HspR mediates\ntransient stimulation of expression of the relevant tRNAs.\nAlthough the biological significance of this finding is not\nclear, it may be relevant that Glu (and Lys) tend to be over-\nrepresented in thermostable proteins [56]. The difference in\namino acid composition of the heat-shock genes relative to all\ngenes, for all amino acids and amino acid pairs, is given in\nAdditional data file 8.\nConclusion\nHigh density IJISS DNA arrays have been developed for glo-\nbal analysis of Streptomyces gene expression and transcrip-\ntion factor binding.

For the gene expression studies the previ-\nously reported two independent hspR disruption mutants,\nMT1151 and MT1153, were used together with the two inde-\npendent, otherwise isogenic, hspR+ integrants, MT1152 and\nMT1154 [58]. The heat-shock conditions were as reported\npreviously [26].\nChromatin immunoprecipitation\nIn order to obtain Streptomyces chromatin of high quality, it\nwas found that rapid, low temperature, physical disruption of\nthe mycelium constituted a more reproducible method than\nthe conventional lysozyme treatment methods. S. coelicolor\nMT1110 was cultivated at 30\u00b0C in 50 ml YEME liquid medium\nin 250 ml flasks with springs (supplemented with 10%\nsucrose, glycine and MgCl2 as specified in [58] up to early sta-\ntionary phase (OD450 approximately 2.0). Cultures were\ndivided into 20 ml aliquots and formaldehyde treated (final\nconcentration, 1%) for 10 minutes at 30\u00b0C in order to in vivo\ncrosslink proteins to DNA; glycine (final concentration of 0.5\nM) was added to quench the formaldehyde and the culture\nwas incubated for a further 5 minutes at 30\u00b0C. Mycelium was\nharvested by centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen and\nthen transferred to a 7 ml PTFE shaking flask with cap (which\nwas also immersed in liquid nitrogen to cool it down). Myc-\nelium was disrupted in a Mikrodismembrator U mechanical\ndevice (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Epsom, Surrey, UK) for 2 \u00d7\n1 minute at 2,000 rpm with one 10 mm diameter chromium\nsteel grinding ball and contents of one tube of lysing matrix B\n(Q-BIOgene, Cambridge, UK). Chromatin processing and IP\nwere based on previous methods [59,60] with additional\nmodifications. The pulverized mycelium was transferred to aGenome Biology 2009, 10:R5\nhttp:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2009\/10\/1\/R5 Genome Biology 2009,     Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R5       Bucca et al. R5.10tube containing 1 ml lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20%\nsucrose, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, Protease Inhibitor Cock-\ntail (Roche, Burgess Hill, West Sussex, UK); one tablet per 10\nml); 3 ml IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl,\n0.5% Triton X-100, plus Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) was\nadded and the chromatin was sheared by sonication (Sonics\nVibraCell VCX130, CH-1217 Meyrin\/Satigny, Switzerland) on\nice. One 2 ml aliquot was sonicated 2 \u00d7 20 s power ON at 50%\npower, 40 s power OFF and the other 2 ml chromatin sample\nwas sonicated 4 \u00d7 20 s power ON at 50% power, 40 s power\nOFF, to obtain the optimal DNA size range of 0.5-1.0 kb. Cell\nlysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 25\nminutes. To assess chromatin quality, aliquots of the chroma-\ntin (70 \u03bcl) were treated with proteinase K (100 \u03bcg, Roche) for\n2 h and the DNA-protein complexes were de-crosslinked at\n65\u00b0C for 6 h; 5 \u03bcl aliquots were subjected to electrophoresis\nand the chromatin fraction(s) with optimal size range were\nsubjected to IP either with specific antibody or with no anti-\nbody (mock IP) as control. The IgG fraction containing anti-\nHspR polyclonal antibodies [61] and the fraction from pre-\nimmune serum from the same rabbit used for immunization\nwere purified through Nab Protein A spin columns (Pierce,\nThermoFisher Scientific, Cramlington, Northumberland,\nUK). Chromatin IP was carried out with 100 \u03bcl specific anti-\nbody added to 800 \u03bcl of chromatin overnight at 4\u00b0C on a\nrotating wheel at 12 rpm; 80 \u03bcl of either sepharose protein A\n(Sigma, Gillingham, Dorset, UK) or Ultralink immobilized\nProtein A\/G beads (Pierce; previously washed twice in phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS), once in PBS containing 5 \u03bcg\/ml\nbovine serum albumin and resuspended in one half bead vol-\nume of PBS containing a protease inhibitor cocktail) were\nadded to the immunoprecipitated chromatin and incubated\nfor a further 3-4 h at 4\u00b0C on a rotating wheel at 12 rpm. The\nDNA-protein complexes bound to the beads were pelleted at\n3,300 rpm for 1 minute and washed four times by resuspen-\nsion in 1 ml ice cold IP buffer (wash 1), IP buffer plus salt\n(wash 2, as wash 1 but with 500 mM NaCl), wash buffer (wash\n3, 10 mM Tris pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% nonidet\nP-40 and 0.5% Na deoxycholate) and TE pH 7.6 (wash 4),\nwith incubation at 4\u00b0C in a rotating wheel for 15 minutes and\ncentrifugation at 3,300 rpm for 1 minute. After the first wash\nthe protein A\/G bound DNA protein complexes were trans-\nferred to a non-stick microfuge tube.\nImmunoprecipitated complexes were eluted overnight at\n55\u00b0C in Tris-EDTA, pH 7.6 (TE), 1% SDS, 100 \u03bcg Proteinase K\n(Roche) in 240 \u03bcl volume. A 170 \u03bcl aliquot of input chromatin\n(not subjected to IP) or mock-IP chromatin was incubated in\nparallel under the same conditions with 240 \u03bcl of elution\nbuffer. Crosslinks were dissociated at 65\u00b0C for 30 minutes fol-\nlowed by centrifugation at 3,300 rpm for 1 minute. The pro-\ntein A\/G beads were washed in 50 \u03bcl TE and the supernatants\nwere pooled. The immunoprecipitated and input chromatin\/\nmock-IP samples were extracted twice with phenol\/chloro-\nform\/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) pH 8, then once with chloro-\nform and the DNA was ethanol precipitated in the presence of\n20 \u03bcg glycogen as carrier, resuspended in 20 \u03bcl ultrapure\nwater and quantified with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer.\nNucleic acid labeling and IJISS array hybridizations\nImmunoprecipitated and input control DNA were labeled\nwith Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP, respectively, using the Bio-\nPrime kit (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). DNA (0.1-1 \u03bcg) was dena-\ntured at 94\u00b0C for 3 minutes in 40 \u03bcl including 20 \u03bcl 2.5\u00d7\nrandom primer mix and kept on ice. Nucleotide mix (5 \u03bcl; 2\nmM dATP, 2 mM dGTP, 2 mM dTTP, 0.5 mM dCTP), 3.75 \u03bcl\nCy3\/Cy5-dCTP (Perkin Elmer, Beaconsfield, Bucks, UK) and\n1.5 \u03bcl of Klenow fragment were added and the reaction was\nincubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. The labeled DNA was purified\nusing the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Crawley,\nWest Sussex, UK) and the incorporated Cy3\/Cy5-dCTP was\nquantified with the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer.\nFor gene expression analysis, cDNA synthesis and labeling\nwere conducted as described previously [62].\nFor hybridization on Sco-Chip2-v1 arrays, 40 pmol of Cy3-\nlabeled immunoprecipitated DNA was co-hybridized with the\nsame amount of Cy5-labeled total input chromatin DNA in\n500 \u03bcl Agilent hybridization buffer (1 M NaCl, 50 mM MES,\npH 7, 20% formamide, 1% Triton X-100 buffer), in an Agilent\nTechnologies hybridization chamber, rotated at 55\u00b0C for 60 h\nin an Agilent Technologies hybridization oven. For hybridiza-\ntion on Sco-Chip2-v2 arrays, 10-40 pmol of Cy3-labeled\nimmunoprecipitated DNA were co-hybridized with the same\namount of Cy5-labeled control mock IP DNA in 120 \u03bcl Agilent\nhybridization buffer as above. To control for Cy-dye bias, the\nhybridization was repeated with the same IP DNA samples\nlabeled in the opposite dye orientation. Two biological repli-\ncates were hybridized on both array formats.\nThe arrays were washed once in 50 ml of 6 \u00d7 SSPE, 0.005%\nN-lauryl sarcosine and once in 0.06 \u00d7 SSPE, 0.18% polyethyl-\nene glycol 200, both for 5 minutes at room temperature. The\narrays were briefly immersed in Agilent Technologies stabili-\nzation and drying solution prior to processing in an Agilent\nTechnologies scanner. The probe signals were quantified\nusing Agilent's Feature Extraction software (version 9.1.3.1).\nTwo different types of dual hybridizations were conducted on\nthe arrays. With the Sco-Chip2-v1 arrays, HspR-IP chromatin\nwas co-hybridized with Cy5-labeled total input chromatin as\nreference and the mock 'no-antibody' IP chromatin was also\nco-hybridized with total input chromatin on a separate array;\nthe enrichment ratios for each probe were calculated as the\nsignal from the former divided by that from the latter array.\nWith Sco-Chip2-v2, the HspR-IP chromatin was co-hybrid-\nized directly with the mock 'no antibody' IP chromatin - the\nsample processed in the same way as the HspR-IP, but with-\nout the specific antibody. To compensate for any dye bias in\nthe latter experiments, replicate hybridizations were con-\nducted with both Cy3\/Cy5 dye orientations on different\narrays. It should be noted that the experimental design inGenome Biology 2009, 10:R5\nhttp:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2009\/10\/1\/R5 Genome Biology 2009,     Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R5       Bucca et al. R5.11terms of hybridizations are different for Sco-Chip2-v1 (IP or\nmock IP versus total chromatin) and Sco-Chip2-v2 (IP versus\nmock IP), being comparable, respectively, to 'traditional'\nmicroarray (expression) experimental designs of indirect and\ndirect hybridizations. However, both designs are valid since\nultimately the same output ratio of interest (IP\/mock IP sig-\nnal) is calculated. The direct hybridization approach, intro-\nduced for Sco-Chip2-v2, is preferred because there is likely to\nbe a reduction in variance (as fewer arrays are used to derive\nthe same ratios).\nRNA isolation analysis, cDNA synthesis and labeling\nThe RNA preparations used during this study were the same\nas those reported in [27]. The RNA was isolated from 36 h S.\ncoelicolor MT1110 cultures grown on SMMS agar, by the\nmethod reported previously [57]; RNA from YEME plus 10%\nsucrose was isolated from 40 h batch cultures by the RNeasy\nmethod described in [27]. RNA quality and integrity was re-\nassessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The Cy3\/\nCy5-dCTP labeled cDNA was synthesized from 10 \u03bcg RNA\nsamples following the methods described in [27].\nMicroarray data pre-processing\nAll (ChIP-on-chip and expression) hybridized arrays were\nscanned using an Agilent Technologies microarray scanner\nand resultant intensities calculated using Agilent Technolo-\ngies Image Analysis and Feature Extraction software (version\n9.1.3.1) with local background correction. Log2 signal\/refer-\nence ratios were calculated for all arrays, the reference chan-\nnel either representing total input chromatin (Sco-Chip2-v1\narray), mock 'no-antibody' IP (Sco-Chip2-v2 array) or cDNA\n(Sco-Chip2-v2 array).\nChIP-on-chip array data were not normalized as the typical\nmicroarray normalization assumptions do not hold [63]. All\nexpression arrays were normalized by the Loess method\nusing the LIMMA package [64,65] in R (version 2.5.0\n[66,67]). For the heat-shock experiment, across array nor-\nmalization was applied such that the median absolute devia-\ntions (MADs) were similar (scale function in LIMMA); no\nfurther normalization was applied to the data from the hspR\nmutant\/wild-type comparison.\nWithin the output of the Feature Extraction software (Agilent\nTechnologies) there are four binary (1 for bad, 0 for good) var-\niables (gIsFeatNonUnifOL\/rIsFeatNonUnifOL, gIsBGNonU-\nnifOL\/rIsBGNonUnifOL, gIsFeatPopnOL\/rIsFeatPopnOL\nand gIsBGPopnOL\/rIsBGPopnOL) that describe outliers in\neach channel on an array. Spots on the Sco-Chip2-v1 array\nwere flagged as poor quality if at least one of the four Feature\nExtraction variables for the total input chromatin reference\nchannel had the value 1 (bad). Spots on each of the Sco-Chip2-\nv2 arrays were flagged if at least one of the two channels was\nclassed as an outlier by Feature Extraction.\nAll data were filtered such that only those probes were\nretained for analysis that had good quality data (not flagged)\nin each replicate array (to control dye bias) within each inde-\npendent experiment: 20,586 probes for Sco-Chip2-v1 array;\n43,056 probes for Sco-Chip2 (ChIP-on-chip); and 43,263\nprobes for the Sco-Chip2-v2 gene expression analysis.\nMicroarray expression data analysis\nThe filtered data sets for the gene expression experiments\nwere analyzed using rank products analysis [37] via the Rank-\nProd package in R (version 2.5.0) [68]. This method has been\nshown to be robust in the identification of true differentially\nexpressed genes in data sets where there are few replicates\nand\/or large variance [69,70]. Differentially expressed genes\nwere identified as having a pfp value [37] less than or equal to\n0.15, equal to a false discovery rate of approximately 15%, a\nthreshold value lower than that applied in the literature with\nthis technique [37]. The microarray-derived expression data\nhave been deposited in ArrayExpress (accession numbers [E-\nMAXD-44], [E-MAXD-46] and [E-MAXD-49]).\nChIP-on-chip data analysis\nSco-Chip2-v1 array\nGenes were identified as having upstream regions enriched\/\nbound by HspR by the following steps. Step 1, probes that had\na significant (corrected p-value < 0.05, non-parametric t-test\n[71] (using Bioconductor package [65])) difference between\nlog2 'antibody IP'\/total chromatin and log2 'no-antibody IP'\/\ntotal chromatin were identified. Step 2, the average (across\nbiological replicates) log2 antibody IP\/total chromatin - log2\nno antibody IP\/total chromatin distribution of significant\nprobes was plotted. Step 3, the right tail, the region of the dis-\ntribution that departs from the typical Gaussian curve of the\ndistribution, was identified and used as the threshold (Addi-\ntional data file 1). Step 4, enriched probes were identified as\nhaving a ratio (average log2 antibody IP\/total chromatin - log2\nno antibody IP\/total chromatin) > threshold (Figure 2a). Step\n5, genes that had at least two probes enriched in a promoter\nproximal region were scored as likely targets of HspR (Addi-\ntional data file 3).\nSco-Chip2-v2 array\nGenes\/regions considered to be directly controlled by HspR\nwere first identified using steps 1-4 (see Additional data file 2\nand Figure 3) as described above with the following excep-\ntions: significant probes were determined by the difference\nbetween log2 'HspR antibody IP'\/'no-antibody IP' and log2\n'HspR pre-immune serum antibody IP'\/'no-antibody IP' (step\n1); average (across biological replicates) log2 'HspR antibody\nIP'\/'no-antibody IP' distribution of significant probes was\nplotted (step 2) to determine the threshold (>1.5 on log2 scale)\nof selection (step 3). Then the novel approach, for ChIP-on-\nchip analysis, of clustering enriched probes was undertaken\nas follows such that identified probe clusters corresponded to\nthe most likely targets of HspR. Steps 1-4 were as above. Step\n5, enriched probes were represented by their correspondingGenome Biology 2009, 10:R5\nhttp:\/\/genomebiology.com\/2009\/10\/1\/R5 Genome Biology 2009,     Volume 10, Issue 1, Article R5       Bucca et al. R5.12position in the genome. A distance matrix was constructed\nbased on the Euclidean distance between each pair (within\nthe enriched probes set) of probe positions, when represented\non a log scale. Step 6, the distance matrix was normalized\nsuch that each distance was between 0 and 1 and converted\ninto a similarity matrix by subtracting each normalized dis-\ntance from 1. Thus, probes with a similarity score of 0 are dis-\ntant from each other in the genome and probes with a\nsimilarity score close to 1 are near each other in the genome.\nStep 7, the similarity matrix was given as input to the cluster-\ning algorithm CAST (Clustering Affinity Search Technique)\n[72], which intrinsically calculates the optimal partitioning of\na data set (via addition and removal of members to a cluster\nsuch that the affinity of a cluster remains 'tight') given a cer-\ntain threshold. The threshold of 0.5 was used to cluster\nprobes; this threshold is equivalent to grouping enriched\nprobes that occur within 2.9 kb of each other in the genome.\nStep 8, clusters of size greater than 1 were annotated with\ngene names (SCO numbers) and designated as genes\/regions\nbound by HspR.\nThe ChIP-on-chip data have been deposited in ArrayExpress\n(accession number [E-MAXD-48]).\nNucleotide sequence motif analysis\nIdentification of putative HspR target sites with HspR consensus \nsequence\nFor each gene identified experimentally as having a putative\nHspR binding site, the respective upstream sequence, 300\nnucleotides upstream of the translational start codon and 200\nnucleotides downstream of the translational start codon, in\nthe correct transcriptional orientation, was extracted from\nthe annotated genome file of S. coelicolor. The entire set of\nupstream sequences was then aligned independently to the\npreviously published HspR consensus sequence (5'-\nTTGAGYN(7)ACTCAA) [6] using ClustalW [73].\nDerivation of a new HspR consensus sequence\nThe set of upstream sequences representing putative HspR\nbinding sites was submitted to the MEME (Multiple Em for\nMotif Elicitation) server [74,75] using default settings except\nfor: minimum width of the motif to search for was set to 5\nnucleotides and maximum width to 30 nucleotides (to reflect\nthe common transcription factor recognition site length in\nprokaryotes); and maximum number of sites to find was set to\n10, to restrict the amount of data obtained.\nQuantitative real time PCR analysis of selected differentially \nexpressed genes\nSpecific primers and probes for SCO4410, SCO5639,\nSCO3202 and SCO4157 were designed using Primer 3 soft-\nware and used for qPCR as described previously [7]. The\nsequences for the forward and reverse primers and dual\nlabeled probes were: SCO4410 forward primer 5'-GTGTCG-\nGGCGAACTGG, reverse primer 5'-CCGGGACGCGATGA, and\ndual labeled probe 5'-TCTGCGATTCCAGCGGGGTC;\nSCO5639 forward primer 5'-ACCATGAAGACGAGAGA-\nGAGG, reverse primer 5'-GTGCACGAACACGTCT, and dual\nlabeled probe 5'-ATGCCGGGCGACGTGCTAAA; SCO3202\nforward primer 5'-CTGATCCAGGAGGGCAAC, reverse\nprimer 5'-GCGTACGTGGAGAACTTGAA, and dual labeled\nprobe 5'-TCCGCGCGGTCGAGAAGTTC; SCO4157 forward\nprimer 5'-GACGTACAAGGCGATCCAG, reverse primer 5'-\nATGATGTTGCCGTTCATGTC, and dual labeled probe 5'-\nCCCTCAACCCGGGCAACTCC.\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assays\nGel-shift assays were conducted using the Light Shift Chemi-\nluminescence EMSA kit (Pierce), following the manufac-\nturer's instructions. The 3'-biotinylated oligonucleotides\ncomprising the HspR binding site, IR3 [26] in the promoter\nregion of the dnaK operon, and similar motifs in the promoter\nregions of SCO5639 and SCO4410 were annealed to their\ncomplementary strands and 200 fmol were used in the bind-\ning reaction together with either purified DnaK-refolded\nHspR (as described in [61]) or a JM109 E. coli cell extract\nover-expressing hspR [26]. In competition experiments a\n200-fold excess of the same, but non-biotinylated, DNA was\nincluded in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction.\nThe dnaK biotinylated probe used in gel shift assays was 5'-\nTGCACACTTGAGCCTGTTCCACTCAAGTCAGCTGGAG; the\nSCO5639 biotinylated probe was 5'-TCGGATTGGAAT-\nTACTAAGATTCAGGATGCAGCACGCATCGT and the\nSCO4410 biotinylated probe was 5'-CGTTTCGGGTGAATC-\nCCGAAAATTCCAGACGTTCCGACGAGG.\nAbbreviations\nChIP-on-chip: chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip;\nCy3: cyanine-3 dye; Cy5: cyanine-5 dye; IP: immunoprecipi-\ntation; IJISS: ink-jet in situ-synthesized; MEME: Maximum\nEm for Motif Elicitation; pfp: probability of false prediction;\nqPCR: quantitative real time PCR.\nAuthors' contributions\nGB performed the microbiological and molecular biology\nwork, including most of the ChIP method development and\nmicroarray-based experiments.
