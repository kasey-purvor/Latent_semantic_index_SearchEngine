Almost all\nrecognised risk factors are potential rather than confirmed. A\nsystematic review found that most previous studies on risk\nfactors for obesity were unable to adequately account for\nconfounding variables (particularly socioeconomic status),5 were\nmainly cross sectional, were underpowered,4 5 and failed to inves-\ntigate the effect of several potential risk factors simultaneously.4 5\nWe identified and quantified risk factors for obesity at age 7\nyears in children who were participating in the Avon\nlongitudinal study of parents and children (ALSPAC). The study\nconcerns a large contemporary cohort in which confounding\nvariables are being considered and potential risk factors are\nbeing tested simultaneously. For the present study, we took into\naccount only risk factors supported by a priori hypotheses.\nMethods\nThe Avon longitudinal study of parents and children is a longi-\ntudinal birth cohort study of the determinants of development,\nhealth, and disease during childhood and beyond. This study is\ndescribed in detail elsewhere.6 Briefly, 14 541 pregnant women\nwith an expected date of delivery between April 1991 and\nDecember 1992 were enrolled; 13 971 of their children formed\nthe original cohort. About 85-90% of eligible mothers took part\nin the study. Parents gave informed written consent for their\nchildren to participate. Data have been collected from question-\nnaires completed by the parents, medical records, and biological\nsamples. We randomly selected a subsample of children from\nthe last six months of recruitment (children in focus group),\naged from 4 months to 5 years, and invited their parents to\nbring them in for regular physical examinations. From age 7\nyears onwards these examinations were extended to the whole\ncohort.\nAnthropometric variables\nWemeasured height to 0.1 cm using the Harpenden stadiometer\n(Holtain; Crymych,Wales). Weight was measured to 0.1 kg. From\nthese values we calculated the body mass index (weight\n(kg)\/(height (m)2). Body mass indices were converted to standard\ndeviation scores relative to UK reference data in 1990.7\nDefinition of obesity\nWe defined obesity as a body mass index equal to or greater than\nthe 95th centile, equivalent to a standard deviation score of 1.64\nor more. This definition has high specificity and moderate sensi-\ntivity for identifying the children with highest body fat\npercentage within the British population.8 9 Obesity defined in\nthis way is also biologically meaningful as it identifies those chil-\ndren who are most likely to experience comorbidity, such as per-\nsistence of obesity, presence and clustering of cardiovascular risk\nfactors, and psychological problems.2\nPotential risk factors\nWe chose putative risk factors on the basis of previously reported\nassociations with obesity, or plausible prior hypotheses. We cross\nchecked the results of our literature search against a systematic\nreview.5 Overall, we identified 31 potential risk factors. Measures\nfor 21 of these risk factors were available for the entire cohort of\nthe Avon longitudinal study of parents and children. A further\nfour potential risk factors relating to growth in infancy and early\nchildhood were available for the children in focus subsample\n(table 1).\nStatistical analyses\nWe carried out a multivariable analysis for the prevalence of\nobesity in three stages using multivariable binary logistic\nBMJ Online First bmj.com page 1 of 7\nCite this article as: BMJ, doi:10.1136\/bmj.38470.670903.E0 (published 20 May 2005) \n Copyright 2005 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd\nregression models. Firstly, owing to the strong association\nbetween maternal education (as a proxy for socioeconomic sta-\ntus) and childhood obesity, we assessed whether the effect of\npotential risk factors was confounded by the mother\u2019s\neducation. Secondly, in an effort to reduce colinearity and to\nminimise the likelihood of producing misleading estimates for\nthe variables (data not shown), we analysed putative risk factors\nfor childhood obesity (the effects of which were found to be\nindependent of maternal education) simultaneously within each\nof the four risk factor groups (intrauterine and perinatal factors;\ninfant feeding and complementary feeding (weaning) practice;\nfamily characteristics and demography; and lifestyle in early\nchildhood). Finally, risk factors that were independently signifi-\ncant (P < 0.10) at the within group stage were then entered into\na final model in which we analysed all variables simultaneously.\nIn the final model we further adjusted the variables for sex (we\nhad a priori reasons for believing that sex might mediate some\nof the effects of some risk factors, although in practice its inclu-\nsion or exclusion made little difference to the odds ratios in the\nfinal model); maternal education (to control or adjust for socio-\neconomic status); and, for the food group variables,10 the child\u2019s\nestimated energy intake at age 3 years. We used \u00012 tests for lin-\near trend for ordered categorical variables and Fisher\u2019s exact\ntest in contingency tables when the expected frequency in any\ncell was less than 5.\nTo assess the effect of the four growth related risk factors\n(measured in the children in focus subsample only) on obesity,\nwe used multivariable binary logistic regression models, while\ncontrolling for all other statistically significant risk factors\nobtained from the analysis of the whole cohort. Owing to the\ncorrelation between these growth related risk factors, we\nindependently assessed their effect on obesity. We produced five\nseparate models for the four risk factors. One risk factor, size in\nearly life, was measured at age 8 and 18 months.\nTable 1 Potential risk factors and confounders, method and time of data collection, and factor level of analysis\nVariables Method and time of data collection Factor level of analysis\nPotential confounders:\nMaternal social class (SES) Self report (derived from maternal occupation) at 32 weeks\u2019\ngestation\nI (highest), II, IINM, IIINM,IV,V (lowest)\nMaternal education Self report at 32 weeks\u2019 gestation CSE or no qualification (lowest), vocational, O level, A level,\ndegree (highest)\nEnergy intake of child Food frequency questionnaire at age 30 months Megajoules per day, continuous\nIntrauterine and perinatal factors:\nBirth weight Measured in delivery room Continuous (unit 100 g)\nSex Medical records Male or female\nMaternal parity Self report questionnaire at 18 weeks\u2019 gestation Number of previous pregnancies resulting in live birth or\nstillbirth: 0, 1, \u22652\nMaternal smoking during pregnancy (28-32 weeks\u2019\ngestation)\nSelf report questionnaire at 32 weeks\u2019 gestation Daily: none, 1-9, 10-19, \u226520\nSeason of birth Date of birth on medical records Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sept, Oct-Dec\nGestational Age Derived from last menstrual period Weeks: <37, 37-42, >42\nNo of fetuses Medical records 1, 2 (twins)\nInfant feeding:\nBreast feeding Child feeding questionnaire at six months post partum Exclusive breast feeding at two months; stopped or\nnon-exclusive breast feeding; never breast fed\nAge at introduction of complementary feeding Child feeding questionnaire at six months post partum Time (months): <1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-6, not yet introduced\nFamily characteristics:\nParents body mass index prepregnancy Maternal self report questionnaire during pregnancy Body mass indices: both parents <30; father only, >30; mother\nonly, >30; both parents >30\nNumber of siblings of child at 18 months Child based maternal self report questionnaire at 18 months\npost partum\nNumber of siblings younger and older: 0, 1, 2, \u22653\nEthnicity of child Maternal self report questionnaire at 32 weeks\u2019 gestation White, non-white\nAge of mother at delivery Enrolment cards, clinical records, notification of delivery Years: <20, 20-24, \u226525\nChildhood lifestyle:\nTime spent watching television per week (at 38 months) Questionnaire Hours: \u22644, 4.1-8, >8\nTime in car on weekdays per day (at 38 months) Questionnaire Not at all, <1 hour, \u22651 hour\nTime in car on weekend days per day (at 38 months) Questionnaire Not at all; <1 hour; \u22651 hour\nDuration of night time sleep (at 38 months) Questionnaire Quartiles of sleep duration (hours: <10.5, 10.5-11.4,\n11.5-11.9, \u226512)\nDietary patterns Food frequency questionnaire at 38 months Factor loadings for food categories from principal components\nanalysis scores in quartiles: junk, healthy, traditional, fussy or\nsnack*\nRisk factors in children in focus subsample:\nWeight standard deviation score at eight months Measurement as part of children in focus study In quartiles at eight months\nWeight standard deviation score at 18 months Measurement as part of children in focus study In quartiles at 18 months\nRapid catch up growth 0-2 years Weight gain of >0.67 standard deviation scores in first two\nyears\nCatch down, no change, catch up\nAdiposity rebound Change in body mass index up to 60 months Very early (by 43 months), early (by 61 months), later (after\n61 months)\nWeight gain in first 12 months Calculated from variable weight at 12 months minus birth\nweight\nContinuous: weight gain between birth and 12 months (units\n100 g)\n*Definitions taken from North and Emmett.10 Factor loading score (highest first): food group 1, Junk type\u2014fizzy drinks, sweets and confectionery, chocolate, chips (fries), fried foods, sausages,\nburgers, crisps, takeaway meals, pot noodles, cook in sauces, bread, pizza, biscuits, and flavoured milks; food group 2, healthy type\u2014pulses, vegetarian foods, rice, pasta, salad, fruit juice,\nfruit, water, eggs, cheese, and fish; food group 3, traditional type\u2014meat and vegetables as meals, meat, poultry, root vegetables, potatoes (not fries), green vegetables, and legumes (peas,\nsweetcorn); food group 4, fussy or snack type\u2014puddings, cakes and buns, biscuits, squash, crisps, cheese, and fruit.\nPapers\npage 2 of 7 BMJ Online First bmj.com\nResults\nIn total, 8234 children attended the clinic at age 7. Measures for\nheight and weight were available for 7758 children (3934 boys\nand 3824 girls; 55.5% of the original 13 971 children) median\nage 7.6 years (range 6.9-8.5 years). The prevalence of obesity did\nnot differ significantly between the sexes (9.2% for boys (n = 362)\nand 8.1% for girls (n = 309; P = 0.08)). Overall, 5493 children\n(70.8% of those with measures for height and weight who\nattended at age 7, 39.3% of the original cohort) had complete\ndata for the multivariable analyses.\nRisk factors in entire cohort\nIntrauterine and perinatal factors\nIncreasing birth weight was independently and linearly\nassociated with increasing prevalence of obesity at age 7 (table 2).\nObesity at age 7 was also significantly associated with maternal\nsmoking between 28 and 32 weeks\u2019 gestation, with some indica-\ntion of a dose response (\u00012 test for linear trend 27.17).\nInfant feeding and weaning practice\nThe apparent protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding on\nobesity at age 7 observed in the univariable analysis remained\nwhen breastfeeding was considered together with the other\ninfant feeding and weaning practice variable (adjusted odds ratio\n0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.91), but had disappeared\nin the final model (table 2). In the final model, timing of\nintroduction of complementary feeding was not significantly\nrelated to the risk of obesity at age 7.\nFamily characteristics and demographics\nWhen only one parent was obese, the risk of obesity at age 7 was\nincreased. The risk was higher when both parents were obese\n(adjusted odds ratio 10.44, 5.11 to 21.32; table 2).\nLifestyle in early childhood\nSleep Sleep duration in children aged 30 months was\nindependently associated with prevalence of obesity at age 7\n(table 2). Children in the lowest two quarters of sleep duration\n( < 10.5 hours and 10.5-10.9 hours) were more likely to be obese\nat age 7 than children in the highest quarter ( > 12 hours; \u00012 test\nfor linear trend 17.8).\nSedentary behaviour The odds ratio for obesity increased\nlinearly as the number of hours of television viewing increased\n(\u00012 test for linear trend 26.7). For children reported to watch tel-\nevision for 4-8 hours per week at age 3 the adjusted odds ratio\nfor obesity at age 7 was 1.37 (1.02 to 1.83). For those reported to\nwatch more than eight hours per week the adjusted odds ratio\nwas 1.55 (1.13 to 2.12).\nDietary patterns We found no conclusive evidence of an asso-\nciation between dietary patterns at age 3 and risk of obesity at\nage 7. A junk food type dietary pattern at age 3 was significantly\nassociated with risk of obesity at age 7, although the association\nonly just reached significance at the 10% level in the final model\n(table 2).\nRisk factors in children in focus subsample\nThe prevalence of obesity at 7 years in the children in focus sub-\nsample was not significantly different from that in the entire\ncohort (8.7%; 79\/909). Children in the highest quarter for weight\n(standard deviation scores) at age 8 months and 18 months were\nmore likely to be obese at age 7 than children in the lower quar-\nters (table 3). Early adiposity or body mass index rebound,\ncatch-up growth between birth and two years, and high rates of\nweight gain in the first 12 months were also independently asso-\nciated with obesity at age 7 (table 3).\nDiscussion\nWe found that eight of 25 putative early life risk factors for obes-\nity in childhood were significantly related to risk of obesity. Our\nstudy supports the hypothesis that the environment in early life\ncan determine risk of later obesity, and suggests several\ninfluences in early life that might be suitable targets for future\nobesity prevention interventions. Our study has advantages over\nprevious similar ones because of its contemporary nature, large\nsample size, longitudinal design, and the use of multivariable\nanalysis. The most critical observers of causes for obesity4 11\nbelieve that evidence suggests a causal role for sedentary behav-\niour, consumption of sugar sweetened drinks, and, possibly,\nformula feeding during infancy. Risk factors for obesity in child-\nhood were, however, uncertain, and evidence based targets for\npreventive strategies were lacking.4 5 We found evidence that the\nlist of potential risk factors for childhood obesity and targets for\npreventive interventions should be extended.\nPotential risk factors not supported by present study\nMany putative risk factors for obesity in our study were not inde-\npendently associated with the risk of obesity in childhood: sex,\nparity, season of birth, gestational age, number of fetuses, timing\nof introduction of complementary feeding, number of siblings,\nethnicity, maternal age, and time spent in the car.\nInconclusive potential risk factors\nWe did not observe an independent protective effect of exclusive\nbreast feeding on obesity in our final model, despite strong uni-\nvariable associations, and in contrast to our previous studies.12\nThe change in direction and magnitude of the odds ratio\nbetween univariable and multivariable models in the present\nstudy, combined with recent evidence of an interaction between\nbreast feeding and maternal smoking during pregnancy,13 led us\nto test for an interaction of this type. Breast feeding in women\nwho did not smoke during pregnancy (but not in women who\nsmoked during pregnancy) was significantly associated with a\nreduced risk of obesity at age 7 years. Evidence from both human\nstudies and animal models show that maternal smoking during\npregnancy may increase the risk of obesity later in life, and that\nthis may operate by programming the regulation of appetite.14 15\nOur measures of dietary patterns were generally not signifi-\ncantly associated with the risk of obesity in the final model, but\nassociations of this kind may be worthy of further investigation.\nPotential risk factors supported by present study\nIn the entire cohort, birth weight, parental obesity, sleep\nduration, and television viewing remained independently associ-\nated with the risk of obesity in the final model. A further four\nfactors were significant in the children in focus subsample: size in\nearly life (standard deviation scores for weight at age 8 months\nand 18 months), weight gain in infancy, catch-up growth, and\nearly adiposity or body mass index rebound (before 43\nmonths16).\nParental obesity may increase the risk of obesity through\ngenetic mechanisms or by shared familial characteristics in the\nenvironment such as food preferences.17 Duration of night time\nsleep may alter later risk of obesity through growth hormone\nsecretion, or because sleep reduces the child\u2019s exposure to\nfactors in the environment that promote obesity, such as food\nintake in the evening. Alternatively, duration of night time sleep\nmay be a marker for some other variable such as level of physical\nPapers\nBMJ Online First bmj.com page 3 of 7\nTable 2 Associations between 21 risk factors and obesity at age 7 years in cohort of Avon longitudinal study of parents and children.

We were unable to analyse sev-\neral potential risk factors\u2014notably physical activity and energy\nexpenditure, parental control over feeding in childhood,22 and\nmaternal diabetes during pregnancy.23 The use of definitions of\nobesity based on body mass index is acceptable as an outcome\nmeasure, but no definition of obesity is ideal at present.7\u20139\nThe Avon longitudinal study of parents and children cohort\nis broadly representative of the UK population,6 although ethnic\nminority groups are slightly under-represented. We cannot rule\nout the possibility that we underestimated the effect of some risk\nfactors that are more prevalent in these groups. When we\nconsidered multivariable effects in our models, the sample size\nwas reduced. The degree of attenuation of effect sizes towards\nthe final models was, however, generally small, and univariable\nodds ratios were usually similar to the multivariable odds ratios,\nwith the exception of breast feeding.\nImplications\nIntrauterine life, infancy, and the preschool period (around the\ntime of the adiposity or body mass index rebound) have all been\nconsidered as possible critical periods during which the long\nterm regulation of energy balance may be programmed.24 Our\nstudy provides evidence of the role of the early life environment\nin the later risk of obesity. Prevention strategies for childhood\nobesity to date have usually been unsuccessful and typically focus\non change in lifestyle during childhood or adolescence. Future\ninterventions might focus on environmental changes targeted at\nrelatively short periods in early life, attempting to modify factors\nin utero, in infancy, or in early childhood, which are\nindependently related to later risk of obesity.\nWe thank the participants of the Avon longitudinal study of parents and\nchildren. The study team comprises interviewers, computer technicians,\nlaboratory technicians, clerical workers, research scientists, volunteers, and\nmanagers who continue to make the study possible. The Avon longitudinal\nstudy of parents and children is part of the WHO initiated European longi-\ntudinal study of pregnancy and childhood.\nContributors: JJR, AS, JA, and PME obtained funding. JJR, ARD, AS, JA, and\nAN were responsible for the concept and design of the study. PME, IR, and\nCS collected the data. JJR, AS, and JA drafted the manuscript. AS, CS, and\nAN provided statistical expertise. All the authors were responsible for the\nanalysis and interpretation of data and for critical revision of the\nmanuscript. The funding bodies had no role in the decision to publish or\nthe content of this article.\nFunding: This secondary analysis was funded by the Scottish Executive\nHealth Department.
