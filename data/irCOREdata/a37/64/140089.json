Aluminium alloys such as 5083 H32 are established light-weight armour materials. As \nsuch, the shock response of these materials is of great importance. The shear strength of a material \nunder shock loading provides an insight into its ballistic performance. In this investigation embedded \nmanganin stress gauges have been employed to measure both the longitudinal and lateral components \nof stress during plate-impact experiments over a range of impact stresses. In turn, these results were \nused to determine the shear strength and to investigate the time dependence of lateral stress behind the \nshock front to give an indication of material response.   \nKeywords: Al 5083, plate-impact, lateral gauge, armour. \nPACS: 47.40.-x, 47.40.Nm., 62.20.M-. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nLow density and high strengths have led to the \nwidespread adoption of aluminium alloys for \narmour applications.  Consequently, knowledge of \nthe high strain-rate behaviour of such alloys is \nadvantageous.  Various authors have investigated \nthe shock response of different grades of \naluminium.  For example, the dynamic response of \nAl 6061 over the stress range 4-22 GPa was \ninvestigated by Huang and Asay [1], who showed \nthat the strength of Al 6061 increased with shock \nloading at the same rate, independent of processing \nhistory.  Similar results were found in a study of \nthree FCC metals, where Millett et al. [2] \ninvestigated strengthening phenomenon in Al \n6082-T6.  Further, by incorporating lateral gauges \ninto the targets and noting the behaviour of lateral \nstress following shock arrival, it was suggested that \nlittle additional work hardening occurred.  This \nwas thought to be due to the presence of dispersed \ninter-metallic particles which acted to suppress the \nformation of dislocation cells. \nThe wrought alloy Al 5083 combines low \ndensity with high strength (due to a high Mg \ncontent) and resistance to corrosion [1,3].  Work on \nAl 5083 has centred on ballistic and relatively low \nstrain-rate testing, either to validate armour \nconcepts or to provide data for model evaluation.  \nE.g. B\u00f8rvik et al. [3] investigated the penetration \nmechanisms in Al 5083-H116 plate.  This data was \nused along with other similar experimental work \n[4] to calibrate a Johnson Cook constitutive model \nby Clausen et al. [5] for strain-rates \u22641,500 s-1.  \nDespite its use as an armour material, relatively \nlittle information exists in the literature on the \ndynamic response of Al 5083 at higher strain-rates.  \nBoteler and Dandekar [6] conducted plate-impact \nexperiments on two armour-grade tempers of \nAl5083 \u2013 H131 (strain-hardened) and H32 (strain-\nhardened\/partially annealed) at impact stresses of \n1.5-8.1 GPa.  Hugoniot equations-of-state were \nestablished and Hugoniot elastic limits (HEL\u2019s) of \n0.57 (H131) and 0.44 (H32) GPa determined from \nthe recorded shock histories.  Elastic-plastic \nresponses involving (i) an initial elastic rise up to \nthe HEL; (ii) elastic-plastic work hardening, \nbefore; (iii) a plastic rise to the Hugoniot stress, \nwere noted for both tempers.  Despite this work, \nwhile studies have been conducted on Al 6082-T6 \n[2], no investigation of lateral stress (and therefore \nshear strength) either at or following shock arrival \nhas been undertaken in Al 5083.  In this paper \nplate-impact experiments involving embedded \nlateral manganin stress gauges are used to measure \nthe lateral stress response of Al 5083 (H32) at \nstrain-rates >5,000 s-1.  In addition, by comparison \nto measured longitudinal impact stresses and the \nestablished US-uP Hugoniot for Al 5083 H32 [6], \nthe variation in shear strength behind the shock is \ninvestigated [7]. \n \nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE  \n  \nElastic properties \n \nSound speeds were measured ultrasonically \nusing a Panametrics 5077PR pulse receiver in the \npulse-echo configuration using appropriate \nPanametrics 5.0 MHz transducers as: cL = 6.32 \u00b1 \n0.10 mm\/\u00b5s, and; cS = 3.11 \u00b1 0.10 mm\/\u00b5s.  The \ndensity was taken as 2.668 \u00b1 0.004 g\/cm3 [6].  \nFrom these results, elastic properties were \ncalculated as: c0 = 5.19 \u00b1 0.10 mm\/\u00b5s (in good \nagreement with the value of c0 = 5.36 \u00b1 0.02 \nmm\/\u00b5s for Al 5083 from [6]) and \u03bd = 0.34 \u00b1 0.02. \n \nPlate-impact experiments \n \nPlate-impact experiments [7] were conducted \nat impact velocities of 80-960 m\/s using a \u220550 mm \nbore single-stage gas-gun [8].  The target, adhered \nto a mounting ring, was placed at the end of a \nsacrificial barrel extension which was attached to \nthe muzzle of the gun according to the arrangement \nshown in Fig. 1.  All surfaces perpendicular to the \nimpact axis were finished to a surface roughness of \n<5 \u00b5m.  Impact velocity was measured by \nsequentially shorting a series of pins, while data \nrecording was started by shorting two trigger pins. \nSealed gun\/barrel\nsection Velocity pin\nblock\nBarrel\nGauge assemblyTrigger pins\nTarget ring\nSabot Flyer plate\nAl 5083 \ntarget\n \nFigure 1. Lateral gauge plate-impact experimental setup. \n \nTarget plates contained a centrally located \nembedded lateral manganin gauge (type J2M-SS-\n580SF-025, manufactured by Vishay Micro-\nMeasurements), situated 2 mm from the impact \nface and insulated from the surrounding Al by 25 \n\u00b5m thick Mylar.  A modified form of the \nimpedance matching technique was used for lateral \ngauge interpretation.  This approach assumed that \nthe strain in a thin (foil) laterally embedded gauge \nwas equivalent to that of the surrounding material \n[9].  Both the elastic-plastic [10] and pressure \nresponse below the HEL [11] were also accounted \nfor.  Hugoniot stress data was established using \nlongitudinal gauges (Vishay Micro-Measurements \n& SR-4 type LM-SS-125CH-048) in both rear \nsurface (at 438 m\/s) and longitudinal-only \nconfigurations [7].  Calibration was in line with \n[12], with interpretation following the impedance \nmatching technique [7].  Examples of these \nconfigurations for the lateral and rear surface \ngauges are shown in Fig 2.

Lateral gauge traces. \n \nVarious common features on the un-processed \ngauge traces presented in Fig. 3 are discussed in \nTable 2.  In addition, two slightly anomalous \nfeatures were apparent on the 438 m\/s.  A kink in \nthe rise at (i) was noted to possess a frequency \nsimilar to that of the overshoot at (c), and was \nconsequently attributed to ringing within the gauge \npackage.  At (ii) noise was linked to the initial \nresponse of the rear-surface longitudinal gauge.  \nGauge failure following the start of the initial \nplateau on the 657 m\/s shot is also apparent, while \na notable initial plateau in lateral stress is \nhighlighted on the 450 m\/s shot. \nShear strength, \u03c4, is related to the longitudinal \nand lateral stresses by [7], \n YX \u03c3\u03c3\u03c4 \u2212=2 ,  (1) \n \nApplying Equation (1) to the data presented in \nTable 1, the variation of shear strength with \n(calculated) impact stress \u2013 assuming a constant \nHugoniot stress \u2013 is shown in Fig. 4.  Errors were \nconsistently smaller than the data points and are \ntherefore not included for clarity.

Variation of shear strength with impact stress. \n \nThe measured shear strengths lie below the \nelastic response, confirming that shock loading \nleads to plastic deformation.  Deviation from the \nelastic response represents the onset of plastic \ndeformation.  Consequently, the intercept with the \nmeasured shear strength data should represent the \nHEL of the shocked Al 5083 (H32).  From Fig. 4, \nthis approach gives \u03c3HEL = 0.47 GPa, in good \nagreement with the value of 0.44 \u00b1 0.02 GPa \nmeasured for Al 5083 H32 in [6].  This good \ncorrelation with the literature, despite the \nassumption of some Hugoniot stress data from [6], \ngives confidence in the observed lateral \nstress\/shear strength behaviour of Al 5083. \nTABLE 2. Key features of lateral traces presented in Fig. 3. \nPoint Description \n(a) Initial ramp \u2013 as the gradient was independent of impact stress, this was attributed to a gauge response. \n(b) A rise to a peak lateral stress. \n(c) An initial overshoot \u2013 a low duration of c.100 ns meant this was attributed to establishment of stress \nequilibrium in the gauge encapsulation, rather than a material response [3]. \n(d) An approximately constant lateral stress (with a slight gradient in some cases). \n(e) A two-stage (elastic and plastic) unloading, following arrival of release waves from the rear of the flyer. \nAssuming a constant Hugoniot stress, \nEquation (1) implies that lateral gauge responses \ncan be used to interrogate changes in shear strength \nbehind the shock [2].  While still controversial \n[7,13], this approach is considered here.  Some \nstructure is apparent in the traces in Fig. 3.  \nFollowing the initial gauge overshoot, a plateau \noccurs followed by a decrease to a constant lateral \nstress which is then maintained until release.  This \ninitial feature (highlighted for the 450 m\/s shot in \nFig. 3) becomes more pronounced at higher impact \nvelocities.  From Equation (1), this decrease in \nlateral stress might be interpreted as strengthening \nbehind the shock [2].  However, these phenomena \nhave a short duration (typically c.200 ns) and, as \nwell as being in close proximity to the initial \novershoot, in all cases are followed by a rapidly \nevolving constant lateral stress.  Consequently, it \nappears there is insufficient information to suggest \nthat strengthening occurs behind the shock.  A \nsimilar conclusion was reached for the similar \nmaterial Al 6082-T6 in [2]; attributed to the \npresence of dispersed fine intermetallic particles \nacting to suppress the formation of dislocation cells \n(and therefore hardening) post-shock. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nThe evolution of lateral stress in Al 5083 \n(H32) has been studied using plate-impact \nexperiments.  Embedded lateral manganin gauges \nhave been used to show that plastic deformation is \noccurring.  The intercept between (measured) \nplastic and (calculated) elastic shear strength \ncurves has yielded an HEL of c.0.47 GPa \u2013 in good \nagreement with results found elsewhere.  In \naddition, while a small initial plateau was noted, \nthe lack of a long-range gradient behind the shock \nin recorded lateral gauge traces suggested little \nstrengthening behind the shock in this temper of Al \n5083.  In line with analysis of Al 6082-T6 reported \nin the literature, this is likely due to the presence of \ndispersed intermetallic particles acting to prevent \nthe formation of ordered dislocation cells. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe authors are grateful to Mr Gary Cooper \nand Mr Andrew Roberts for experimental support.  \nBritish Crown Copyright \u2013 MOD\/2009. \nREFERENCES \n1.
