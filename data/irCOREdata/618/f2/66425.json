We discuss, in detail, two processes with\nrapidity gaps: exclusive Higgs production with tagged outgoing protons and production\nby Weak Boson Fusion, in each case taking H \u2192 bb\u00af as the signal. We make an extensive\nstudy of all possible bb\u00af backgrounds, and discuss the relevant experimental issues. We\nemphasize the special features of these signals, and of their background processes, and\nshow that they could play an important role in identifying a light Higgs boson at the\nLHC.\n1 Introduction\nThe identification of the Higgs boson(s) is one of the main goals of the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) being constructed at CERN. According to current theoretical prejudice it is likely that\na Higgs boson will exist in the mass range 114 < MH < 135 GeV. In the Standard Model de-\nscription of electroweak data, the virtual effects favour a Higgs with mass at, or just above, the\nLEP bound of 114 GeV. Moreover, in the Minimal Supersymmetric Model a scalar Standard-\nModel-like Higgs boson with mass below 135 GeV should exist1. However, the experimental\ndetection of such a \u2018light\u2019 Higgs boson at the LHC will be challenging. There is no obvious\nperfect detection process. Rather there is a range of complementary possibilities, as illustrated\nin Table 1. The Table shows the number of identified Higgs events and the number of back-\nground events, for a Standard Model Higgs boson of mass MH = 120 GeV for the integrated\nluminosity of 30 fb\u22121 planned for the first two or three years of LHC running, for each of the\nvarious proposed detection channels. A glance at the Table shows that, either large signals are\naccompanied by a huge background, or the processes have comparable signal and background\nrates for which the number of Higgs events is rather small.\nBesides containing the conventional processes for the detection of a light Higgs boson, the\nTable also lists processes (c,d,f) with a rapidity gap on either side of the boson, which provide\na clean environment for its production. These processes are often overlooked, but they have\nspecial advantages. Here we shall study two of these processes in detail.\nFirst, in Section 2, we discuss the exclusive process pp \u2192 p + H + p, where the + sign\nindicates the presence of a rapidity gap. We show that it is possible to tag the outgoing\nprotons such that the Higgs may be identified, and its mass measured to an accuracy of about\n1 GeV, using the \u2018missing mass\u2019 method. That is using tagged protons we have MH = Mmissing\nwith \u2206Mmissing \u223c 1 GeV. Importantly, the process allows an independent measurement of the\nHiggs mass via the H \u2192 bb\u00af decay, MH =Mbb\u00af, although now the resolution is much poorer with\n\u2206Mbb\u00af \u223c 10GeV. The existence of matching peaks, centred about Mmissing = Mbb\u00af, is a unique\nfeature of the exclusive diffractive Higgs signal2. Besides its obvious value in identifying the\nHiggs and in sharpening the determination of its mass, we will see that the mass equality also\nplays a key role in reducing background contributions. Another advantage of the H \u2192 bb\u00af signal\nis that, at leading order, the gg \u2192 bb\u00af background process is suppressed by a Jz = 0 selection\nrule, see Section 2.3 [8, 9].\nOf course, we have to pay a price for the survival of the rapidity gaps, so the event rate\nis low. Nevertheless the process has the advantage that the signal exceeds the background.\nThe absolute value of the pp \u2192 p + H + p cross section has been calculated in Refs. [4, 10].\nThe derivation is outlined in Section 2.1. Moreover the predicted value can be checked exper-\nimentally by measuring the rate of the double-diffractive production of dijets (of comparable\n1A discussion of, and references for, the current status of allowed masses and other properties of Higgs bosons\ncan be found, for example, in Ref. [1].\n2This may be contrasted with the search for a Higgs peak sitting on a huge background in theM\u03b3\u03b3 spectrum,\nsee process (a) of Table 1.\n1\nmass). The uncertainties of the calculation of the pp \u2192 p +H + p cross section are discussed\nin Section 2.2.\nEqually important to the calculation of the exclusive double-diffractive p + (H \u2192 bb\u00af) + p\nsignal, is the estimation of the bb\u00af background. The background processes are found to be\nsuppressed by their spin and colour structure, and are interesting in their own right. The\nvarious sources of the background are discussed in Sections 2.3 and 2.4. First, in Section 2.3,\nwe summarize the sources, together with their sizes relative to the Higgs signal, and then, in\nSection 2.4, we give the detailed justification of the results. Section 2.5 is devoted to a study of\nproduction by soft Pomeron-Pomeron collisions. We find that it gives a negligible contribution\nboth to the exclusive H \u2192 bb\u00af signal and to the background. In Section 2.6, we turn to a\ndiscussion of the experimental issues connected with the exclusive diffractive signal. We study\nthe experimental efficiencies, the choice of cuts, the accurate determination of the \u2018missing\nmass\u2019 via the measurement of the forward protons and, finally, the problems connected with\nthe \u2018pile-up\u2019 of multiple interactions in each beam crossing.\nThe second process that we study is the central production of a Higgs boson via WW fusion\npp\u2192 qWWq\u2192 jet +H + jet,\nsee Section 3. We may suppress the background to this process by exploiting the fact that the\ncross section is rather flat as a function of the transverse momentum, qt, of the Higgs boson,\non account of the large W boson mass. Moreover, since this process is mediated by t channel\nW exchange, which is a point-like colourless object, there is no corresponding bremsstrahlung\nin the central region [11, 12, 13, 14] and hence no Sudakov suppression of the rapidity gaps.\n2 Exclusive diffractive H \u2192 bb\u00af production\nIn this section we make a detailed study of the third process of Table 1, namely [10, 9]\npp\u2192 p+H + p\nwhere the Higgs decays via the bb\u00af mode. We assume that the outgoing protons and the b and b\u00af\njets can be identified and measured, and that there are no other particles in the final state. We\nquantify both the signal and the background for this exclusive process and, moreover, discuss\nthe relevant experimental issues.\n2.1 Calculation of the p+H + p cross section.\nThe basic mechanism for the process is shown in Fig. 1. It turns out that the typical values\nof the transverse momentum Qt of the gluon, which screens the colour, are much smaller than\n2\npp\nQt\nH\nx2\nx1x1\u2032\nx2\u2032\nFigure 1: Schematic diagram of the exclusive double-diffractive production of a Higgs boson,\nthat is the process pp\u2192 p+H+ p, in which the + signs indicate the presence of rapidity gaps.\nMH , but are yet sufficiently large for perturbative QCD to be applicable.

In this domain the skewed unintegrated densities are given\nin terms of the conventional (integrated) densities g(x,Q2t ). To single log accuracy, we have\n[10]\nfg\n(\nx, x\u2032, Q2t ,\nM2H\n4\n)\n= Rg\n\u2202\n\u2202 lnQ2t\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\u221a\nT\n(\nQt,\nMH\n2\n)\nxg\n(\nx,Q2t\n)\uf8f6\uf8f8 (4)\nwhere T (Qt, \u00b5) is the survival probability that the gluon remains untouched in the evolution\nup to the hard scale \u00b5 = MH\/2. This Sudakov factor T is the result of resumming the virtual\ncontributions in the DGLAP evolution. It is given by\nT (Qt, \u00b5) = exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u00b52\nQ2\nt\n\u03b1S(k\n2\nt )\n2\u03c0\ndk2t\nk2t\n\u222b \u00b5\/(\u00b5+kt)\n0\n[\nzPgg(z) +\n\u2211\nq\nPqg(z)\n]\ndz\n)\n. (5)\nThe square root of T arises in (4) because the survival probability is only relevant to the\nhard gluon. Note that the gluon with x\u2032 \u2243 0 is almost \u2018at rest\u2019 and so there is no possibility of\n3\nQCD radiation [15]. The multiplicative factor Rg is the ratio of the skewed x\n\u2032 \u226a x integrated\ndistribution to the conventional diagonal density. For x\u226a 1 the factor is completely determined\n[16]. We find Rg \u2243 1.2 at the energy of the LHC.\nThe radiation associated with the gg \u2192 H hard subprocess is not the only means to\npopulate and to destroy the rapidity gaps. There is also the possibility of soft rescattering\nin which particles from the underlying event populate the gaps. The probability, S2, that the\ngaps survive the soft pp rescattering was calculated using a two-channel eikonal model, which\nincorporates high mass diffraction [17]. The parameters of the model were obtained from a\nglobal analysis of all available soft pp (and pp\u00af) scattering data. In this way, we find S2 = 0.02\nfor the process p+H + p at the LHC. Including this factor, the cross section is predicted to be\n[4]\n\u03c3(pp\u2192 p+H + p) \u2243 3 fb (6)\nfor the production of a Standard Model Higgs of mass 120 GeV at the LHC.\nIn Section 2.2 we estimate a factor of two uncertainty in the cross section prediction given\nin (6). On the other hand it is frequently quoted that the predictions of the cross section for\ndiffractive Higgs production cover many orders of magnitude, and for this reason the many\nauthors choose not to consider this Higgs signal. This is unfortunate. Sometimes the rates\nof different diffractive mechanisms are compared. Sometimes models are used to predict the\nexclusive signal which are not valid. Indeed, care must be taken when comparing the theoretical\npredictions for the exclusive pp\u2192 p+H+p process with the results of Monte Carlo simulations.\nFor example, when implementing the Soft Colour Interaction (SCI) prescription [18] in PYTHIA\n[19], it was found [20] that hard production in single diffractive processes observed at the\nTevatron could be described reasonably well, but that the generator hardly ever produces any\n\u2018double-Pomeron-exchange\u2019 events. Finally, an extremely low limit was claimed [21] for the\nexclusive pp\u2192 p+H + p cross section.\nThe fact that such a generator yields an extremely low probability for exclusive processes\nis not surprising. The generator was created to simulate inelastic processes. It operates by\nstarting from the hard subprocess and generates the parton showers by backward evolution.\nThe generator never accounts for the important coherence between different parton showers,\nnor for the colourless nature of the initial particles. The incoming protons are just considered\nas a system of coloured partons. As a consequence, the probability not to emit additional\nsecondary jets (and so to reproduce an exclusive process) turns out to be negligibly small. In\nparticular, such a generator is unable to reproduce the elastic cross section. Such generators\ncreate many secondary minijets at the parton shower stage and the probability to screen all\nthese minijets by colour interchange is extremely low. Such generators were not constructed to\nreproduce exclusive processes, where the colour coherence effects and colourless nature of the\nincoming hadrons are important.\n4\n2.2 Uncertainty in the cross section prediction\nNote that, in principle, (6) is an absolute prediction for \u03c3(p+H+p). Of course, the various in-\nputs are subject to uncertainty. Let us discuss these in turn. First we have the large suppression\nfrom the probability S2 = 0.02 that the rapidity gaps survive soft pp rescattering. From the\nanalysis [17] of all soft pp data we estimate the accuracy of the prediction for S2 is \u00b150%. One\ncheck of the eikonal model calculations of S2 is the estimate of the diffractive dijet production\nrate measured by the CDF collaboration [22] at the Tevatron. The rate, when calculated using\nfactorization and the diffractive structure functions obtained from HERA data, lies about a\nfactor of 10 above the CDF data. However, when rescattering corrections are included, and the\nsurvival probabilities computed, remarkably good agreement with the CDF measurements is\nobtained [23]. There is, perhaps, a small tendency that an even stronger suppression is required,\nso the true survival probabilities S2 may be a bit smaller than our predictions.\nSecond, although, on account of the Sudakov form factor, the Qt integral in (1) is infrared\nsafe, the cross section may have some contribution from the non-perturbative region. Again, we\nexpect an accuracy of \u00b150%, but in this case the + sign looks more realistic. The uncertainties\nin the gluon densities fg in the integrand are estimated at \u00b15%, leading to a \u00b122% error on\nthe cross section. This estimate takes into account the accuracy of the value of Rg and the\nuncertainty on the integrated gluon density xg, at x \u223c 0.01 relevant to the LHC. Finally, we\nhave NLO contributions to the Sudakov T factor (\u00b120%) and NNLO corrections to the gg \u2192 H\nvertex factor (\u00b120%). Adding these errors in quadrature gives a factor two uncertainty in (6).\nWe stress that the predicted value of the cross section can be checked experimentally. All\nthe ingredients, except for the NNLO correction to the gg \u2192 H vertex, are the same for our\nsignal as for exclusive double-diffractive dijet production, pp \u2192 p + dijet + p, where the dijet\nsystem is chosen in the same kinematic domain as the Higgs boson, that is M(jj) \u223c 120 GeV\n[4, 10]. Therefore by observing the larger dijet production rate, we can confirm, or correct, the\nestimate of the exclusive Higgs signal.\nOf course, so far our discussion has been within the confines of the Standard Model. We\nshould not overlook the possibility that the exclusive Higgs signal may reveal New Physics. For\nexample, the Higgs cross section will be 4 (or even 9) times larger if there were to exist a fourth\ndoublet containing one (or two) quarks heavier than the Higgs.\n2.3 Summary of the backgrounds to the p+ (H \u2192 bb\u00af) + p signal\nFor a light Higgs boson the dominant decay channel is H \u2192 bb\u00af. However, it is impossible to\nobserve this decay in an inclusive process at the LHC, since it is overwhelmed by a huge QCD\nbb\u00af background. The advantage of exclusive double-diffractive Higgs production with forward\ngoing protons is that there exists a Jz = 0, parity even, selection rule, which strongly suppresses\nthe leading order ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af background subprocess. The PP superscript is to indicate that\neach gluon comes from a colour-singlet t channel state. One way to see the Jz = 0 selection\n5\nrule is to note that, in the equivalent gluon approach (or in a planar gauge), the polarisation\nvectors of the t channel gluons in Fig. 1 are aligned along the transverse component of the\nloop momentum ~Qt [4, 9]. Integrating over ~Qt leads to the amplitude M of the ggPP fusion\nsubprocess being formed from the average over the two transverse polarisations \u03b51, \u03b52 of the\nincoming gluons\nM = 1\n2\n\u2211\n\u03b51,\u03b52\nM(\u03b51, \u03b52)\u03b4\u03b51,\u03b52. (7)\nThe delta symbol reflects the Jz = 0, parity even, character of the di-gluon gg\nPP incoming state.\nFor colour-singlet bb\u00af production the Born-level contributions of Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) cancel each\nother, in the massless mb \u2192 0 limit, due to summation (7). More generally, as a consequence\nof helicity conservation, and P and T invariance, for the real parts of the Jz = 0 gg\nPP \u2192 bb\u00af\namplitudes [24], the corresponding contributions to the cross section vanish with decreasing\nquark mass as m2b\/E\n2\nT , where ET \u223cMH\/2 is the transverse energy of the b or b\u00af jet.\n(a)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nb\nb\n(b)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nb\nb\nFigure 2: Colour-singlet gg \u2192 bb\u00af production, where \u03b1 denotes the colour of the incoming\ngluons.\nIt is convenient, first, to list the possible sources of the bb\u00af background to the exclusive\np + (H \u2192 bb\u00af) + p Higgs signal and to state the size of each background in terms of the signal.\nThe justification for the numerical values is given in the next subsection, 2.4. We quote the B\/S\nusing the anticipated missing mass resolution, \u2206Mmissing = 1 GeV, expected from employing\ntaggers for the outgoing protons.\nAt leading order (LO) there are ggPP \u2192\u201c bb\u00af \u201d background contributions, despite the Jz = 0\nselection rule, which we summarize below.\n(i) The prolific ggPP \u2192 gg subprocess may mimic bb\u00af production since we may misidentify the\noutgoing gluons as b and b\u00af jets. Assuming the expected 1% probability of misidentification\nand applying 60\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 120\u25e6 jet cut, we estimate B\/S \u223c 0.06.\n6\n(ii) There is an admixture of |Jz| = 2 production, arising from non-forward going protons [9].\nIt gives B\/S \u223c 0.08.\n(iii) For a massive quark there is a contribution to the Jz = 0 LO cross section of orderm\n2\nb\/E\n2\nT ,\nleading to B\/S \u223c 0.06.\nAt next-to-leading order(NLO), we have the possibility of ggPP \u2192 bb\u00afg background contri-\nbutions.\n(iv) The extra gluon may go unobserved in the direction of a forward proton. This background\nmay be effectively eliminated by requiring the approximate equality Mmissing =Mbb\u00af.\n(v) The extra gluon is collinear with either the b or b\u00af jet. We will show that this is suppressed\nfor soft radiation by the specific spin structure of the process3, and leaves a background\ncoming from three jet bb\u00afg production with B\/S \u223c 0.06.\nWe also consider NNLO bb\u00afgg background contributions.\n(vi) There is a NNLO bb\u00af contribution, which comes from the diagram formed by the product\nof the NLO amplitudes, which is negligibly small.\n(vii) Another source of this background may be called central inelastic production [4], where\nthe H \u2192 bb\u00af signal or QCD bb\u00af background is accompanied by central soft gluon radiation.\nWe will show that it causes a 1\u20132% high mass tail to the \u2018missing mass\u2019 Higgs signal, and\nagain gives a negligible contribution to the background.\nFinally, we consider the effects from the collisions of two soft Pomerons. After imposing the\nmissing mass equality, we find that production by Pomeron-Pomeron fusion gives a negligible\ncontribution to both the H \u2192 bb\u00af signal and the bb\u00af background. Pomeron-Pomeron fusion is\ndiscussed separately in Section 2.5.\nIn summary, taking all these sources of background into account, we would expect a sig-\nnal\/background ratio of about four. The reliability of this signal-to-background estimate,\nS\/B \u2243 4, with respect to the theoretical uncertainties, is much better than the factor of\ntwo uncertainty in the signal itself. This is because the gap survival probability, S2, the unin-\ntegrated gluon distributions, fg, the NLO T -factor and even the contribution from the low Qt\nnon-perturbative domain are common4 to both the signal, S, and the background, B. Thus the\nmain theoretical uncertainties cancel in the ratio. However, there is another source of uncer-\ntainty due to the higher-order virtual corrections to the background processes. We call these,\n3This extension of the Jz = 0 selection rule suppression to soft radiation is true for soft radiation at any\nangle.\n4Except for the |Jz| = 2 admixture which has a different structure in the Qt loop integral for the signal and\nthe background.\n7\nat present unknown, contributions the background K factor. Since we have included the K\nfactor for the Higgs signal in (2), we conservatively take the same K factor for the background.\nThe effect is to reduce S\/B to about 3.\nOf course, the experimental uncertainties depend on the values of the mass resolutions,\n\u2206Mmissing and \u2206Mbb\u00af, the probability to misidentify a gluon as a b-jet, the b-jet tagging efficiency\nand on the appropriate choice of the jet cone size \u2206R; see Section 2.6. Here we have taken\nvalues which should be attainable, but clearly, in practice, these have to be optimized with\nreference to the detector, and further gains are possible.\n2.4 Determination of the individual backgrounds\nHere we quantify each of the potential backgrounds listed above. As a reference point we start\nwith the largest exclusive signal, that is one in which we have no b jet identification. In other\nwords, we have the central production of a pair of high ET jets together with tagged outgoing\nprotons. For this situation the ratio of the background to the Higgs signal5 is\nB(ggPP \u2192 gg)\nS(ggPP \u2192 H \u2192 jj) \u2243 600\n(\n\u2206M\n1 GeV\n)\n, (8)\nwhere we have normalised the ratio to the expected experimental missing mass resolution,\n\u2206Mmissing = 1.0GeV. For clarity, we omit this factor in brackets from now on in this subsection.\nIn (8), the QCD background has been suppressed by imposing the polar angle acceptance cut,\n60\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 120\u25e6, in the jet-jet centre-of-mass frame. The cut removes half of the bb\u00af Higgs signal,\nbut more importantly removes the ggPP \u2192 gg infrared singularity.\nUsing (8) as a reference point, we now estimate the background\/signal for the exclusive\nprocess for each of the sources of background listed in Section 2.3. We divide them into\nbackground contributions at LO, NLO and NNLO.\n2.4.1 The LO bb\u00af backgrounds\n(i) Clearly, for the exclusive double-diffractive Higgs signal to be of value, we must reduce\nB\/S of (8). We therefore need to tag both the b and b\u00af jets. Even so, there is a chance that\nthe gluons are misidentified as b and b\u00af jets. The expected probability of misidentification\nis about 1%. Therefore by observing the b and b\u00af jets we reduce the background by 104,\nand hence\nB(ggPP \u2192 gg \u2192 \u201c bb\u00af \u2032\u2032)\nS(ggPP \u2192 H \u2192 bb\u00af) \u2243 0.06. (9)\n5Note that the NLO K factor is included for the gg \u2192 H vertex, (2), but in (8) we omit the virtual NLO\ncorrections to the background. For presentation purposes, the denominator in (8) actually refers to only the\nH \u2192 bb\u00af component and does not include the H \u2192 gg decays; for MH = 120 GeV, including the H \u2192 gg mode\nwould enlarge the denominator by about 10%.\n8\n(ii) Of course, there is a background from QCD bb\u00af production itself. We have emphasized\nthat at LO this vanishes in the massless quark limit, mb \u2192 0, due to the Jz = 0 selection\nrule. However, there is an admixture of |Jz| = 2 caused by the transverse momenta ~pit\nof the outgoing protons. In the exact forward direction, the Jz = 0 selection rule is\nsimply a consequence of angular momentum conservation and the absence of spin-spin\ncorrelations between particles separated by a large rapidity gap6. However, violation of\nthe rule can come from orbital angular momenta, pitr. For our process, the distance r\nis controlled, not by the size of the proton, but by the effective size of the t-channel gg\nstate. Hence r \u223c 1\/Qt. Therefore the admixture of |Jz| = 2 states is strongly suppressed\nby the ratio 4p21tp\n2\n2t\/Q\n4\nt . It was estimated in [9] that the mean |Jz| = 2 admixture is less\nthan 1.5%. In addition, bb\u00af production (even for |Jz| = 2) is suppressed in comparison to\ngg production by a factor 27\u00d74 due to the colour and spin 1\n2\ncharacter of the quark. The\nfactor represents the exact ratio of the subprocess cross sections at \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 (see equations\n(49) and (52) of [4]). Thus we have\nB|Jz|=2(gg\nPP \u2192 bb\u00af)\nS(ggPP \u2192 H \u2192 bb\u00af) \u2261\nB\u00af\nS\n\u00d7 (|Jz| = 2 admix.) \u223c B\u00af\nS\n\u00d7 0.015 \u223c 600\u00d7 0.015\n27\u00d7 4 \u223c 0.08, (10)\nwhere B\u00af would have been the ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af background if the Jz = 0 selection rule had not\nexisted, that is if we had averaged over the incoming gluon helicities in the usual way (as\nfor inclusive production), rather than as in (7).\n(iii) A second way to avoid the Jz = 0 prohibition of the LO background process, gg\nPP \u2192 bb\u00af,\nis to allow for the b quark mass. At LO the cross section is suppressed by a factor m2b\/E\n2\nT\nin comparison to bb\u00af production B\u00af in the absence of the Jz = 0 selection. It is even\nsmaller if we account for the non-Sudakov double-logarithmic suppression [25]. For the\nacceptance cut 60\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 120\u25e6 the jet transverse energy ET >\u223c 10mb, and thus\nBmb(gg\nPP \u2192 bb\u00af)\nS(ggPP \u2192 H \u2192 bb\u00af)\n<\u223c\n600\u00d7 10\u22122\n27\u00d7 4 \u223c 0.06. (11)\n2.4.2 The NLO bb\u00afg backgrounds\nThe NLO subprocess ggPP \u2192 bb\u00afg also generates a background for our exclusive double-\ndiffractive Higgs signal. First recall that the virtual NLO \u03b1S correction has already been\nincluded in the gg \u2192 H vertex, (2). Of course, the extra gluon jet may be observed experimen-\ntally in the central detector and so these background events can be readily eliminated. The\nexceptions are the emission of the gluon, first, in one of the beam directions and, second, at\nlarge angles, either with small energy \u03c9 \u226a ET or in the b or b\u00af jet direction.\n6Here we refer to the correlation between \u2018two spin-flips\u2019. It is very small, and moreover decreases rapidly\nwith beam energy, in soft processes. At small distances it is described by the spin structure function g2(x),\nwhich, in comparison with the unpolarised structure function, is suppressed by a power of x. That is the\ncorrelation is suppressed exponentially by the size of the rapidity gap.\n9\n(iv) Extra gluon radiation in either of the beam directions cannot be observed directly. On\nthe other hand we know it must be energetic. The size of the initial colour-singlet system\nis 1\/Q0 < 1 GeV\n\u22121. Therefore the transverse momentum of the emitted gluon should be\ngreater than 1 GeV. If the gluon is to go unobserved outside the calorimeter, that is to\nhave \u03b7 > 5, then the gluon energy E = pt cosh \u03b7 > 75 GeV. This considerably violates\nthe required equality Mmissing = Mbb\u00af for a Higgs signal, and so this background can be\neliminated.\n(v) Now we come to the background associated with large angle gluon emission. First we\nnote that soft gluon emission from the b and b\u00af quark jets themselves is not a problem,\nsince for this case we retain the cancellation between the graphs of Fig. 2. Next we note\nthat emission from the virtual b quark line is suppressed by at least a factor of \u03c9\/E (and\nmaybe an even higher power7 of \u03c9\/E), where \u03c9 and E are, respectively, the energies of a\ngluon and outgoing b quark in the ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af centre-of-mass frame. Formally, the factor\narises from the large virtuality of the extra b quark propagator, and reflects the fact that\nthe 1\/\u03c9 formation time of the extra soft gluon is much larger than the lifetime of the\nvirtual t channel b quark.\n(a)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nb\nb\nt\u03b1\nt\u03b2\n(b)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nb\nb\nt\u03b1\nt\u03b2\n(c)\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nb\nb\nt\u03b3\n\u03b2\nFigure 3: Colour-singlet gg \u2192 bb\u00afg production, where \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are gluon colour labels and\nwhere the ti are the colour matrices for the quark-gluon vertices.\nThe potential danger is emission from one of the incoming t channel gluons. At first\nsight it appears to be a rather large contribution of order (\u03b1SNC\/\u03c0) ln(MH\/Q0), where\nthe large log comes from the d\u03c9\/\u03c9 integration embracing soft gluon emission. On the\nother hand, to accuracy \u03c9\/E, we deal with pure classical emission which does not change\nthe spin structure of the amplitude. Therefore we might expect the same cancellation\n7An explicit calculation for the \u03b3\u03b3(Jz = 0)\u2192 bb\u00afg cross section shows a (\u03c9\/E)4 suppression, see for example\n[24]. This is a consequence of the Low-Burnett-Kroll theorem [26], see [27].\n10\nbetween the graphs of Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) as was obtained in Fig. 2. But now the bb\u00af system\nis in a colour octet state and the commutator\n[t\u03b1, t\u03b2] = if\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3t\u03b3 (12)\nspoils the cancellation. Here ti are the colour matrices of the quark-gluon vertices. All is\nnot lost, however, since now we have a third diagram, Fig. 3(c), which has precisely the\ncolour and spin structure to restore the cancellation. Thus soft gluon emissions from the\ninitial colour-singlet ggPP state factorize (see, for example, [28]) and, due to the overriding\nJz = 0 selection rule, QCD bb\u00af production is still suppressed. In this way the ln(MH\/Q0)\ncontribution is neutralised and we are left with O(\u03b1S) large angle hard gluon emission.\nSuch three jet bb\u00afg production can be observed and excluded experimentally, except for\nhard gluon radiation along the b and b\u00af jet directions. If we denote the cone angle needed\nto separate the g jet from the b (or b\u00af) jet by \u2206R, then the expected background from\nunresolved three jet events is of about8\n(\u03b1SCF\/2\u03c0) (\u2206R)\n2B\u00af(ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af) \u223c 0.01B\u00af(ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af) (13)\nfor \u2206R \u223c 0.5, where CF = (N2C \u2212 1)\/2NC = 4\/3. In (13) we sum the contributions from\ngluon emission in the directions of both b and b\u00af jets. Recall that B\u00af is the ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af rate\nin the absence of the Jz = 0 selection rule. Noting (8) and (10), we thus see that we have\na background-to-signal ratio of\nB(ggPP \u2192 bb\u00afg)\nS(ggPP \u2192 H \u2192 bb\u00af) \u223c\n0.01\u00d7 600\n27\u00d7 4 \u223c 0.06. (14)\nThis source of background may be further suppressed by choosing smaller size b and b\u00af jet\ncones, \u2206R. The price is the presence of an extra Sudakov form factor which accounts for\nthe absence of bremsstrahlung outside the more confined cone, that is radiation which\nwould normally be allowed in the jet hadronisation. As we need to exclude only hard\ngluon radiation, this is a single, not double, logarithmic form factor. It is present in both\nthe signal and the background, and so does not change the S\/B ratio. However, it reduces\nthe number of selected events. The form factor is estimated to be \u223c \u2206R0.8. On the other\nhand it is possible that if we take a smaller \u2206R then we will improve the efficiency of the\nb and b\u00af identification. In this way, the Sudakov suppression arising from a smaller \u2206R\ncould be partly compensated. Of course, in practice, we should choose the jet cone size\n\u2206R to optimize the significance of the signal.\n2.4.3 The NNLO bb\u00afgg background\n(vi) There is a contribution to the bb\u00af QCD background cross section at NNLO, which comes\nfrom the \u2018square\u2019 of NLO amplitudes, in which the Jz = 0 amplitude for the gg\nPP \u2192 bb\u00af\n8We thank Andrei Shuvaev for calculating this higher-order contribution (see also Ref. [29], where the\nformalism to obtain the helicity amplitudes for the gg \u2192 bb\u00afg subprocess is given).\n11\n(a) Central-inelastic (b) soft I  IP P\nIP\nIP\n=\n(c) Low-Nussinov\nFigure 4: Double-diffractive production of a Higgs boson (shown by the bold central arrow)\naccompanied by gluon emission in diagram (a) and by Pomeron remnants in diagram (b).\nDiagram (c) shows the Pomeron-Pomeron production process from a QCD viewpoint, in which\neach Pomeron is represented by two-gluon exchange.\nsubprocess does not vanish, even in the massless quark limit. Note that, for the imaginary\npart of the one-loop box diagram, the arguments based on T invariance are redundant [24].\nHowever, numerically, this bb\u00af background contribution appears to be very small (see [30]\nfor an explicit calculation in the case of \u03b3\u03b3(Jz = 0)\u2192 qq\u00af, and also [25]). This is because\nit is suppressed by the two-loop factor (NC\u03b1S\/4\u03c0)\n2, where \u03b1S is taken at a large scale\nof the order of MH\/2. Therefore the corresponding ratio B\/S does not exceed 0.01, and\ncan be safely neglected.\n(vii) Finally, there is a background to pp\u2192 p+(H \u2192 bb\u00af)+p due to central inelastic production,\nwhere the bb\u00af pair (or Higgs boson) is accompanied by soft QCD radiation in the central\nregion, see Fig. 4(a). Hard radiation is excluded by requiring the mass equalityMmissing =\nMbb\u00af, as noted above. Moreover, recall that soft radiation from the final b or b\u00af quark\nlines is already included in the jet finding algorithm. So we are left with central soft\nradiation from the t channel lines. Due to factorization of soft gluon radiation from the\ncolour-singlet ggPP state (see, for example, [28]), this emission does not alter the signal-\nto-background ratio. However, it could blur out the sharp missing-mass peak of the Higgs\nsignal. Fortunately, the phase space for such radiation is strongly limited by requiring\nthe Mmissing = Mbb\u00af mass balance. Consider the emission of two extra soft gluons, that\nis the NNLO subprocess ggPP \u2192 Hgg. (One extra gluon cannot be produced together\nwith the Higgs boson from the colour-singlet ggPP state, and the bb\u00afg QCD background\nhas already been considered in (iv) above.) Using factorization, the probability of the\n12\nemission of the extra two gluons is\n(\n1\nN2C \u2212 1\n)\n1\n2!\n[\n2\n(\n\u03b1SNC\n\u03c0\n) \u222b\nd\u03c9\n\u03c9\ndp2t\np2t\n]2\n, (15)\nwhere the first factor reflects colour-singlet production, 1\/2! accounts for the identity\nof the two gluons, the factor 22 allows for emission from both incoming gluons and the\nfamiliar double-log accounts for emission with gluon energies \u03c9 > pt > Q0, as discussed\nbefore. The energy \u03c9 may be bounded by experimentally requiring Mmissing = Mbb\u00af. If we\nassume an experimental resolution \u2206Mbb\u00af = 10 GeV and take \u03b1S = 0.25 at the low Q0\nscale, then the probability (15) is about 1\u20132%. This Hgg background does not affect the\nsignificance of the exclusive Higgs signal, but produces a small tail on the high side of the\nmissing mass peak. Due to the factorization of soft gluon emission, which we discussed\nin (v), the direct QCD bb\u00afgg production is additionally suppressed by the Jz = 0 selection\nrule, and is hence negligible.\n2.5 Production by soft Pomeron-Pomeron collisions\nIn addition to the central inelastic production, Fig. 4(a), studied above, there exists another\nclass of diagrams, Figs. 4(b or c), in which the colour flow is screened in a different way.\nThese diagrams describe production by soft Pomeron-Pomeron inelastic collisions9. Within\nthis approach, one may use the factorizable, a la Ingelman-Schlein [31], model in which the\nHiggs (or bb\u00af pair) is created by a gg \u2192 H (or gg \u2192 bb\u00af) subprocess that is driven by the \u2018gluon\nstructure functions\u2019 of the Pomerons themselves [32, 33, 34].\nHere we check the size of the background to the exclusive Higgs signal which comes from soft\nPomeron-Pomeron collisions. We use the Donnachie-Landshoff parameterization [35] to calcu-\nlate the Pomeron flux and take the gluon structure function of the Pomeron to be zgP (z) \u2264 0.7,\nwhich is consistent with the H1 analysis [36]. Besides the relatively low values of the Pomeron\nflux and of gP , the main suppression comes from the requirement that the Pomeron-Pomeron\nmass (MPP =Mmissing) measured by the tagged protons, should lie within theMbb\u00af+\u2206Mbb\u00af mass\ninterval. This mass balance requires that the gluon in the Pomeron has momentum fraction z\nclose to 1, where the structure function gP (z) becomes small. To allow for uncertainties in the\nH1 analysis we conservatively take gP (z) = 0.7, even in this large z domain. Then the cross\nsection for the Pomeron-Pomeron fusion subprocess is, see Ref. [4]\n\u03c3(IPIP \u2192 bb\u00af) =\n\u222b\ndz1g\nP (z1)\n\u222b\ndz2g\nP (z2)\u03c3\u02c6(gg \u2192 bb\u00af)\n<\u223c (0.7)2 2\n(\n\u2206Mbb\u00af\nMPP\n)2\n\u03c3\u02c6(gg \u2192 bb\u00af). (16)\n9From a QCD viewpoint the soft Pomeron-Pomeron interaction, Fig. 4(b), should be regarded as Fig. 4(c)\nwhere the soft Pomerons are replaced by (Low-Nussinov) two-gluon exchange. We note that diagram 4(c)\ncontains an extra factor of \u03b1S , as compared to diagram 4(a). Of course the coupling is taken at a low scale, but\nnevertheless we should not be surprised when we find the contribution of 4(c) is less than that of 4(a).\n13\nWe mentioned that the phenomenological flux of the soft Pomeron is relatively small. Indeed,\nfor MPP = 120GeV the effective Pomeron-Pomeron luminosity is a factor two smaller than the\ncorresponding luminosity for the exclusive process, which was calculated in terms of the unin-\ntegrated gluon distributions (compare the curves denoted by \u2018soft IPIP \u2019 and \u2018excl\u2019 in Fig. 2(c)\nof Ref. [4]). So, finally, the suppression factor in going from the exclusive process to Fig. 4(b)\nis\n1\n2\n(\n\u2206Mbb\u00af\nMPP\n)2\n<\u223c 4\u00d7 10\u22123, (17)\nif we take \u2206Mbb\u00af = 10 GeV. Even though the Jz = 0 selection rule is absent for Pomeron-\nPomeron production, it gives a background which is much less than the background caused by\nthe |Jz| = 2 admixture of (ii).\nIf we consider Pomeron-Pomeron production of the H \u2192 bb\u00af signal, then there is an addi-\ntional suppression coming from a factor 1\/ (2(N2C \u2212 1)), since the gluons producing the Higgs\nmust have the same helicity and colour. In practice such a soft Pomeron-Pomeron source of\nthe signal appears to be very small, even for MPP \u226b MH .\nOur estimates of the inclusive double-diffractive background bb\u00af production, when translated\nto Tevatron energies, agree reasonably well with the Monte Carlo simulation of Ref. [32]. Of\ncourse, in Ref. [32] only the contribution of Fig. 4(b) was considered, but the result was nor-\nmalized to the CDF data [37] and in this way the major contribution coming from Fig. 4(a)\ntype of diagrams was accounted for. On the other hand, we do not reproduce the results of\nRef. [33].\n2.6 Experimental issues concerning pp\u2192 p+H + p\nThe most prominent characteristic feature of diffractive Higgs production is the formation of\nrapidity gaps between the Higgs decay products and the scattered protons. The gaps will\nbe however of limited use at the LHC collider, when the machine is operated at medium\n(1033 cm\u22122s\u22121) and high (1034 cm\u22122s\u22121) luminosity, due to pile-up, as discussed in Section 3.2.\nTo select these events in the experiment it is important to tag the scattered protons. This\nhas furthermore the crucial advantage that the mass of the Higgs particle can be precisely\nreconstructed from the missing mass to the protons, as detailed below. Due to the relatively\nlow mass of the central (Higgs) system, the scattered protons have small \u03be values, in the range\nof 10\u22123\u201310\u22122, where \u03be is the momentum fraction lost by the proton in the interaction. A\nclassical technique to detect scattered protons at small t and with small relative momentum\nloss, is by using so-called Roman Pot detectors. Recently a new type of detectors, called\nmicrostations [38], has been proposed for this purpose. Studies of the LHC beam optics [39]\nreveal that, in order to access these small \u03be values, the Roman Pot detectors or microstations\nneed to be installed at about 425 m from the interaction region. These detectors can have an\nacceptance in \u03be down to 1\u20132\u00d710\u22123, and a parametrization of the acceptance was included in\nthe event estimates in this paper.\n14\nIn order to efficiently record and measure the diffractively scattered protons in Roman Pot\ndetectors or microstations, they have to be sufficiently separated from the beam particles. The\ndetectors, which are located at 420 m and 430 m from the interaction point, could then be used\nto define the proton momenta by measuring, with respect to the beam axis, the difference in\nhorizontal displacement at the two locations as a function of the average proton deflection.\nWe observe that a variation of \u2206\u03be = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 produces a 80 \u00b5m difference in the hori-\nzontal displacement of a diffractively scattered proton. With state-of-the-art silicon microstrip\ndetectors this difference can be measured with a precision of the order of 5\u00b5m. The expected\nmomentum spread of the beam protons is \u2206\u03be\/\u03be = 10\u22124. For a symmetric event configuration\n(\u2206 = |\u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2| \u2264 0.04), we then expect in the most optimistic case a mass resolution of the\norder of \u2206Mmissing\/Mmissing better than 1% [39]. This leads to the value \u2206Mmissing = 1 GeV,\nwhich is used in Table 1.\nThe acceptance of diffractively scattered protons is limited by the minimum measurable\ndeflection and, on the other hand, by the aperture of the last dipole magnet (B11) of the LHC\nlattice, i.e., 30mm, and leads to a range of observable missing masses of 20 GeV < Mmissing <\n160 GeV. A similar reason restricts the observable rapidity interval of the central produced\n(Higgs) system. Since we do not measure \u03be smaller than 1\u20132\u00d710\u22123, we are unable to select\nevents with Higgs rapidity |yH| >1.2\u20131.6. As a result, the efficiency of proton tagging is 60%\nfor MH = 120 GeV. In calculating acceptances, the detector edge effects (guard ring, shielding,\npossible possible insulation layer, etc.) play a significant role and can be further minimised.\nEffects due to detector alignment accuracy have still to be assessed carefully.\nFor selecting the central diffractive events, a sufficient suppression of the huge non-diffractive\nevent rates has to be provided. An event selection strategy could consist of the following three\nsteps:\n(i) At the first trigger level, select events with a pair of jets in the central detector (|\u03b7| < 2.5)\neach with ET > 40 GeV and with the difference between their azimuthal angles \u03c61\u2212\u03c62 =\n180\u25e6 (within a given cell size of \u2206\u03b7\u00d7\u2206\u03c6). Furthermore, one can make use of the absence\nof significant additional central activity in these events.\n(ii) At a later stage of data collection, or in off-line analysis, use the forward-backward proton\nmeasurement to calculate the missing mass, and\n(iii) analyse the events of interest by using the central detector data.\nWith condition (i), a relative suppression of background to central diffractive events of the\norder of 104 is obtained. Therefore, a well recordable first level trigger rate may be achieved [39].\nPile-up events will also be important for the Roman Pot detectors. The PYTHIA [19] Monte\nCarlo program was used to estimate the probability to have an additional proton accepted on\none side of the interaction region from single soft diffraction for the different luminosities, and\n15\namounts to 8% (medium luminosity), 40% (high luminosity) and 200% (SLHC10). Hence at the\nSLHC special care is needed to control the combinatorics generated by background from pile-up\nevents. Since by then the mass of the Higgs to some accuracy will be known, an appropriate\nmass window can be chosen to select genuine scattered protons that belong to the diffractive\nHiggs event.\nThe next issue is the efficiency \u03b5b of tagging a b jet. The value is correlated with the\nprobability P (g\/b) to misidentify a gluon as a b jet. As we have seen in (i) of Section 2.4.1,\nwe require P (g\/b) = 0.01 to reduce the gg background to an acceptable level. For this value\nof P (g\/b), the present estimate of the efficiency of b and b\u00af tagging is (\u03b5b)\n2 = 0.3, but it is not\ninconceivable that this could be improved to a larger value, perhaps as large as (\u03b5b)\n2 = 0.6.\nIf it turns out that this is impossible for P (g\/b) = 0.01, then it is better to accept a worse\nmisidentification probability P (g\/b) in order to obtain a higher value of (\u03b5b)\n2. This will raise\nthe background, but will result only in a relatively small reduction in the significance of the\nsignal. For this reason we use (\u03b5b)\n2 = 0.6 in our estimates.\nTherefore the event rate in (c) of Table 1 includes a factor 0.6 for the efficiency associated\nwith proton tagging and 0.6 for b and b\u00af tagging. Besides this the signal has been multiplied by\n0.5 for the jet polar angle cut and 0.67 for the H \u2192 bb\u00af branching fraction. Hence the original\n(\u03c3 = 3 fb)\u00d7 (L = 30 fb\u22121) = 90 events is reduced to an observable signal of 11 events, as shown\nin Table 1.\n3 Higgs production by Weak Boson Fusion (WBF)\nWe have seen in Section 2 that the selection of events with large rapidity gaps is an effective way\nof suppressing the QCD background. Recall that rapidity gaps appear naturally in Weak Boson\nFusion (WBF) [11, 13]. One can thus exploit this property to suppress the QCD background\nand to observe a light Higgs boson produced by WBF via its main H \u2192 bb\u00af decay mode,\nin addition to the rather rare decay modes, \u03c4\u03c4 , WW \u2217, etc. usually proposed for WBF, see\nTable 1 and Refs. [2, 5, 40]. Another special feature of Higgs production by WBF is the high\nmomentum transfer, pt \u223c O(MW ). The hard subprocess may be written as\nqq \u2192 jetW W jet\u2192 jet +H + jet (18)\nwhere again a + sign denotes a rapidity gap. The process is sketched in Fig. 5.\n3.1 The WBF H \u2192 bb\u00af signature\nTwo alternative signatures of the WBF H \u2192 bb\u00af events exist. First, we may select events with\nlarge pt (quark) jets in the forward and backward directions, separated from the H \u2192 bb\u00af decay\n10The Super LHC luminosity is taken to be 1035 cm\u22122s\u22121.\n16\npp\nq\nH\nq\nW\nW\nFigure 5: Higgs production by weak boson fusion at the LHC, which is accompanied by forward\nand backward going quark jets.\nby rapidity gaps. Alternatively we may select events with a high qt Higgs (or bb\u00af system), with\nrapidity gaps on either side.\nIn practice the H \u2192 bb\u00af decay should be observed in the central detector. We choose the\nrapidity |yHiggs| < 2.1, and impose the polar angular cut 60\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 120\u25e6 on the b and b\u00af jets\n(as discussed in Section 2.4). The accompanying quark jets are observed in the forward and\nbackward calorimeters. For these we take11 3 < |\u03b7jet| < 5. The results presented in the upper\nentry of (f) in Table 1 correspond to the selection of events with pt > 30 GeV (quark) jets\nin the forward and backward directions, which are separated from H \u2192 bb\u00af by rapidity gaps.\nFor the alternative signature, shown by the lower entry of (f) in Table 1, we impose the cut\nqt > 30 GeV on the H \u2192 bb\u00af system. The detailed kinematics are described in Ref. [41].\nThe leading order QCD background for process (18), with H \u2192 bb\u00af, is rather large, even\nafter imposing the presence of rapidity gaps and the high pt (or qt) cuts. There is, therefore,\nno need for a detailed discussion of the higher-order background contributions in this case.\nAlthough S\/B is relatively small, the cross section is considerably larger than for the exclusive\nprocess and so the significance of the signal looks good. In fact in some respects, this signal is\nsimilar to the search for the decay H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 in an inclusive process; compare entries (a) and (f)\nof Table 1.\nThe main problem is that it is hard to identify rapidity gaps in inclusive reactions at high\nluminosity, where pile-up becomes significant. The possibility to identify the vertex of Higgs\nproduction, and to separate off the particles associated with other interactions, is discussed in\nSection 3.2.\nThe survival probability S2 of the rapidity gaps to soft rescattering is an ingredient in the\ncalculation of both the signal and the background of these j+(bb\u00af)+j events. It is informative to\n11If we were to enlarge the coverage up to \u03b7jet = 7 then we would increase the cross section by only 3%,\nleaving the signal-to-background ratio essentially unaltered.\n17\ndiscuss the values of S2 that are obtained. Recall that the survival of the gaps, at the hadronic\nlevel, are computed using a two-channel eikonal model for soft rescattering [17, 23]. For WBF\nthe probability S2 depends more sensitively on the model than the previous calculation of S2\nfor pp \u2192 p + (bb\u00af) + p of Section 2. The incoming partons which participate in the WBF\nsubprocess qq \u2192 q + (bb\u00af) + q are rather hard. They have large x and a larger scale. Thus in\na multi-channel eikonal approach, it is probable that such partons belong to the component\nwith the lower absorptive cross section. Hence the survival probability S2 is larger. Clearly the\nresults will depend on how the partons (of the global analysis12) are distributed between the\ndifferent diffractive eigenstates, that is different channels of the eikonal.\nHere we have used model II of Ref. [23], which looks the most realistic and which provides a\ngood description of the CDF data for the diffractive production of a pair of high ET jets. For the\nfirst WBF signature (upper entry of (f) in Table 1), the corresponding values of S2 are 0.30 and\n0.25 for the signal and background respectively; whereas for the Higgs qt > 30 GeV signature\n(lower entry) the values of S2 are 0.26 and 0.21 for the signal and background respectively.\nIn model I of Ref. [23], which may be regarded as an extreme case, it is assumed that\nall the valence quarks are concentrated in the eikonal component with the smaller absorption\ncross section and the gluons in that with the larger cross section13. In this case the QCD bb\u00af\nbackground, which originates mainly from gluons, has gaps with a smaller survival probability\n(S2 = 0.09 for both signatures (f) of Table 1) and the significance of WBF Higgs signal would\nbe increased to about 8\u03c3.\n3.2 Experimental issues associated with Higgs production by WBF\nwith rapidity gaps\nBoth the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC prepare to measure jets and energy flows\nas far out as \u03b7 = 5, matching the cuts in Section 3.1. Hence the forward jets can be tagged\nand measured. For the trigger typically four jet final states need to be selected, supplemented\nwith topological requirements, if one wants to go down in jet ET threshold as much as 30 GeV.\nWhen the LHC collider operates at medium and high luminosity, the recorded events will\nbe plagued by overlap interactions in the same bunch crossing. At medium luminosity (i.e.,\n1033 cm\u22122s\u22121) on average 2.3 inelastic events are expected to be produced each bunch crossing.\nHence the rapidity gaps will often be destroyed by these additional pile-up events. In particular,\nfor the high luminosity operation (1034 cm\u22122s\u22121), on average 22 additional events are overlaid\non top of the signal event, which will essentially always destroy the gap.\nIt is, however, possible to use the detector information to try to reconstruct the gap in\nthe hard scattering events. The vertices of the individual collisions will be (non-uniformly)\ndistributed along the beam axis in the interaction region over a distance of 10\u201320 cm. The\n12We use MRST partons [42].\n13This was the model used to generate the results in the lower half of Table 1 of Ref. [41].\n18\nprecise tracking subdetectors of the experiments will, however, allow the reconstruction of vertex\npositions with a precision of a few tens of microns, and even soft tracks can be associated to\ntheir corresponding vertex with a precision of a fraction of a millimeter. Thus one can imagine\nan event selection that checks for rapidity gaps based on the charged particles associated with\nthe proper vertex. Furthermore, the transverse energy of particles from the soft overlap events\nis generally low and, for example, considering only particles with an ET value larger than of\norder 1\u20132 GeV will often reveal the underlying rapidity gap of the hard scattering event.\nAll rapidity gaps in the events should be detectable by vertex and\/or soft energy cuts\nparticularly for the data taken at medium luminosity, and probably also for high luminosity\ndata samples. However, it is unlikely that these techniques can be used for the SLHC type of\nluminosity of 1035 cm\u22122s\u22121.\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Measurement of Higgs couplings\nAs emphasized in the Introduction there is no single obvious best discovery channel for a light\nHiggs boson at the LHC. Rather the search should employ all possibilities. The comparability of\nchannels has some advantages in the measurement of Higgs couplings. The Double-diffractive\nHiggs production processes (entries (c) and (d) of Table 1) are mediated by the subprocess\ngg \u2192 tt\u00af\u2192 H , and are thus proportional to the H\u2013tt\u00af coupling (squared). The same is true for\nproduction processes (a) and (b). For process (a) the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay is mainly controlled by the\nH\u2013WW coupling, while processes (b) and (c) are proportional to the H\u2013bb\u00af coupling (squared).\nFrom Table 1 we note the relatively large significance of the WBF processes, (e) and (f), in\nwhich the Higgs signal is separated from forward and backward high pt jets by rapidity gaps.\nThese WBF processes are, of course, driven by the H\u2013WW coupling. If the H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 decay\nprocess is observed, then we can study the Higgs-lepton coupling. The estimates presented in\nTable 1 for this qq \u2192 qHq \u2192 j\u03c4\u03c4j process are taken from Ref. [2]. The values agree reasonably\nwell with the results14 shown in Table 1 of Ref. [41]. Thus by measuring combinations of the\nabove processes it is possible to determine the Higgs coupling to b and t quarks, W bosons and\nthe \u03c4 lepton.\n4.2 Conclusion\nThis paper has concentrated on the production of a light Higgs boson accompanied by rapidity\ngaps. In Section 2 we discussed exclusive double-diffractive (CP-even) Higgs production\npp\u2192 p+H(bb\u00af) + p, (19)\n14The \u03c4\u03c4 results in Table 1 of [41] included a 10% efficiency to identify the two \u03c4 leptons.\n19\nand in Section 3, Weak Boson Fusion via the subprocess\nqq \u2192 q +H + q \u2192 jet + bb\u00af+ jet. (20)\nIn both cases we estimated the cross section for the H \u2192 bb\u00af signal and for the QCD bb\u00af\nbackground, at the LHC. The results obtained are summarised in entries (c) and (f) of Table 1.\nProvided that appropriate proton taggers are installed (see Section 2.6), process (19) has\nthe special advantage that the Higgs can be identified by a sharp peak in the protons\u2019 \u2018missing\nmass\u2019 spectrum and, simultaneously, as a peak in the bb\u00af mass spectrum. The required equality\nMmissing = Mbb\u00af, allowing for resolution, is of great value, not only to establish the signal, but\nalso to suppress the bb\u00af + ng background. In addition, the existence of a Jz = 0 selection rule\nautomatically greatly suppresses the leading order (LO) QCD bb\u00af background. We estimated\nthe LO, NLO and NNLO contributions to the bb\u00af + ng background. It turned out that, for\nproduction from a colour-singlet two-gluon system, the special colour and helicity structure of\nthe subprocess is such that even the higher order (NLO, ...) contributions to the background\nare suppressed. In summary, we find15\nSignal\nBackground\n\u2243 3 (21)\nfor the exclusive double-diffractive production of a light Higgs boson, decaying via bb\u00af, at the\nLHC. The favourable signal-to-background ratio is offset by a low event rate, caused by the\nnecessity to preserve the rapidity gaps so as to ensure an exclusive signal. Nevertheless, entry (c)\nof Table 1 shows that the signal has comparable significance16 to the standard H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 and\ntt\u00afH search modes (entries (a) and (b)).\nThe cross section for the production of a 120 GeV Higgs boson at the LHC, via the exclusive\npp \u2192 p + H + p process, was calculated to be 3 fb (see Section 2.1), but after including the\nH \u2192 bb\u00af branching fraction, and the acceptance and efficiency cuts, we arrive at only 12% of the\nsignal. The breakdown of the depletion of the signal is summarized at the end of Section 2.6.\nThus for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\u22121 (300 fb\u22121) we would register 11 (110) events.\nNoting the B\/S ratio of (21), we see that these signals have a significance of about 3\u03c3 and 9\u03c3\nrespectively. We estimate a factor of two uncertainty in the cross section for this exclusive Higgs\nsignal (see Section 2.2), but a much better reliability for the signal-to-background prediction,\n(21), since the main theoretical uncertainties cancel in the ratio (see Section 2.3).\nThe Weak Boson Fusion signal, (20), does not need the installation of proton taggers, and\nhas a favourable significance; see Section 3 and Table 1. As discussed in Section 3.2, the main\nproblem is to identify these rapidity gap events from the additional pile-up events, that is from\noverlap interactions in the same bunch crossing. There is good reason to believe that, at the\n15Here, and in Table 1, we (conservatively) assume that the higher-order virtual contribution to the back-\nground has approximately the same relative size (that is the same K factor) as the signal.\n16However, when the NLO contributions to the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 signal and background are included, the significance\nof this signal is increased to about 7\u03c3 for 30 fb\u22121 LHC luminosity and Higgs mass MH \u2243 120 GeV [7].\n20\nmedium luminosity of 1033 cm\u22122s\u22121 of the LHC, the problem can be overcome, and that we can\ngo a considerable way to achieving the numbers quoted in entry (f) of Table 1.\nIn conclusion, we have shown how the rapidity gap processes, (19) and (20), may play a key\nrole in identifying and studying a light Higgs boson at the LHC.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Andrei Shuvaev for valuable help in the calculations of the QCD bb\u00af background,\nand Marco Battaglia, Michael Kraemer, Jerry Lamsa, James Stirling, Theodore Todorov and\nPeter Williams for useful discussions.

The mass of the Higgs boson is taken to be 120 GeV and the\nintegrated luminosity is taken to be 30 fb\u22121. The notation ggPP is to indicate that the gluons originate within\noverall colour-singlet (hard Pomeron) t-channel exchanges; see, for example, Fig. 1. The entries for the various\nprocesses are taken, or scaled from the results for 100 fb\u22121 luminosity, from references (a) [2], (b) [3], (d) [4], (e)\n[2, 5], (g,h) [2] and (i) [6], where the K factors have been omitted. Processes (c) and (f) are discussed in detail\nin Sections 2 and 3, respectively, of this paper. A detailed study of the NLO contributions to the background\nto the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 signal shows the K factor is 0.65 that of the signal [7]. Taking these K factors into account the\nauthors find that the significance of the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 signal is increased to 7\u03c3.\n25\n"}
