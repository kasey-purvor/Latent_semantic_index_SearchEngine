INTRODUCTION\nThose teaching law to business students commonly debate two teaching issues. One is essentially practical, whilst  the\nother is academic. First, there is a tension between what business students require and what law  tutors  are  trained  or\nconditioned to provide. The tutors generally will have formal legal  training,  with  many  having  experience  of  legal\npractice. As most of the authors are these same tutors, it is no surprise that most business law textbooks and  materials\nfollow a law school approach, \u201cheavy on cases and ... black letter law.\u201d[1] Yet few, if any, of their  students  aspire  to\nbecome lawyers. In these terms, tutors and  students  are  mutually  alien.  To  achieve  their  business-oriented  goals,\npeople in business prefer to resolve conflicts and prevent legal problems.[2] Litigation is not desirable.\n               A second - academic - issue is  that  business  students  invariably  struggle  with  the  legal  problem-solving\nexercises provided in their assessments.[3] This is because  they  are  not  steeped  in  the  necessary  legal  reasoning,\nanalysis and logic associated with dedicated law students.\n               These apparently unrelated  needs  of  business  students  share  common  skills:  (1)  identifying  issues,  (2)\norganising and analysing facts, and (3) decision-making. A seemingly  unrelated  discipline  is  the  science  of  proof,\nwhich was developed most graphically in 1913 by John Henry Wigmore.\n               Wigmore\u2019s thesis was that legal studies focused on the admissibility of  evidence  whilst  failing  to  develop\nany science of proof. Wigmore addressed this shortcoming with his chart method of analysing  facts.  He  presented  a\nvisual method of identifying issues, organising and analysing facts accordingly,  and  consequential  decision-making.\nHis, and other developments that followed, invariably were based upon famous criminal law cases. But the  principles\ndeveloped are adaptable for uses beyond reviewing a criminal trial. So it should not be difficult or  alien  for  business\nlaw lecturers to teach these skills, which would provide genuine  benefits  for  business  law  students.  The  key  is  to\nadapt the Wigmore model for these needs.\n               The aim of this paper is to explain the Wigmore chart method, derive the essence  of  the  necessary  thought\nprocesses, and adapt the chart method to suit  the  needs  of  business  law  students,  providing  basic  skills  that  will\nenhance work-related decision-making and academic legal problem-solving. It is possible to adapt Wigmore\u2019s method\nfor levels ranging from year one undergraduate to post-graduate; and for all lengths ranging  from  a  one  hour  lesson\nintegrated into a substantive law course, to a dedicated course lasting a month or longer.\nII. THE WIGMOREAN CHART METHOD\nIn 1913, John Henry Wigmore published The Problem of Proof,[4] his \u201cnovum organum\u201d[5] (new instrument) for the\nstudy of judicial proof. His contention was that although the work of legal practitioners fell into two  distinct  parts  of\nadmissibility and proof, the principles of admissibility had \u201cmonopolized\u201d  formal  studies  of  evidence.[6]  Wigmore\ninstead focused on proof. His purpose was to establish a science of proof. Wigmore employed his  method  to  analyse\nthe evidence admitted in famous trials. Over the years, others have adopted and developed Wigmore\u2019s method, and  in\nthe main based their studies upon criminal trials.[7]\n               Wigmore\u2019s new instrument was a form of flow chart, mapping the  issues,  evidence,  and  inferences,  using\nnumbered symbols and connecting lines, with a separate key explaining the issue, evidence, or  inference  represented\nby each symbol. Its logic is binary, with every proposition tending support or undermine the ultimate issue.\n               There are a number of tasks in drafting a chart. Some should be completed before  starting  the  chart,  others\nwhilst drafting it. It is a fluid process. For instance, one may offer a fact to the chart, then consider its probative value,\nand symbolise this accordingly. The primary task is to identify the issues. Normally  there  will  be  an  ultimate  issue\n(did A. murder X.?), and one or more necessary sub-issues (e.g. whether A. had the  requisite  intent  to  harm,  and\/or\nwhether the killing was unlawful).  Then  the  evidence  must  be  organised  and  considered  for  its  probative  value\ntowards the ultimate issue, via the sub-issue(s). This is achieved by analysing each supposed piece  of  evidence  \u201cinto\nall its subordinate inferences.\u201d[8] The chart  can  help  distinguish  facts  as  alleged  from  facts  as  believed.[9]  The\nmethod is to make necessary and reasonable inferences  from  each  fact.  \u201cAny  scheme  which  fails  to  provide  this\nwould be like a bridge with the bolts left out of the truss angles.\u201d[10] Sometimes it is  necessary  to  make  a  chain  of\ninferences. In aid of the process, where appropriate, the chart can illustrate the issues, pieces of  evidence,  inferences,\nweakening and strengthening inferences, and supposed general truths being used in support of a particular inference.\nWigmore suggested a range of at least 30 symbols. The principal ones were:\n[pic]       (Circle) Circumstantial evidence.\n[pic]       (Square) Testimonial evidence.\n[pic]       (\u201cMore than\u201d) Explanatory evidence. For circumstantial evidence, this weakens an inference  by  offering  an\nalternative explanation. For testimonial evidence, it discredits the testimony. \n[pic]       (Closed triangle)  Corroborative  evidence.  For  circumstantial  evidence,  strengthening  the  inference,  and\nclosing down other possible explanations; for testimonial evidence, closing down possibility of witness error.\nWhere the explanatory evidence detracts from the desired inference, an arrowhead is placed on the line connecting the\ntwo, but only after  the  chart-maker  has  considered  the  matter  (an  example  of  the  fluid  nature  of  this  method).\nCorrespondingly, an \u2018X\u2019 is placed on the connecting line if corroborative evidence is considered  effective.  Wigmore\noffered slight variations to distinguish the prosecution and defence arguments, and provided a number of marks  (such\nas dots, arrows  and  small  circles)  to  qualify  a  symbol,  say  endorsing  the  proposition  it  represents,  or  marking\nevidence presented to the  senses  of  the  tribunal.  Where  an  inference  is  based  on  a  supposed  general  truth,  the\nsupposed general truth may be added with an appropriate symbol, say a circle (for  circumstantial  evidence),  with  its\nprincipal symbol number repeated with qualification letter, e.g. \u201c4a\u201d.\nAn  introductory  example  used  by  Wigmore  supposes  that  a  prosecution  witness  at  trial   demonstrates\nhostility towards the defendant, and that recently the defendant had fired this witness. The  probity  of  the  witnesses\u2019\nevidence may be charted thus:\nKEY\n1. D. carried knife into his apartment.\n2. Witness statement to that effect.\n3. Witness was biased against D.\n4. Witness recently fired by D.\n4a. A person recently fired by a defendant will be biased against that defendant.\n5. When testifying, witness displayed hostility towards defendant.\n6. Statements by D. and Witness to that effect.\nHere, 1 is an alleged fact that the defendant carried a knife into his apartment, and 2  is  the  testimony  to  this  effect.\nThe witnesses\u2019 bias is charted by 4 and the general truth behind this assertion by 4a. The inference is reinforced by 5.\n                Note  how  the  chart  works  from  top  to  bottom  and  from  right  to  left.  Wigmore   proposed   that   the\nprosecution\u2019s (or claimant\u2019s) evidence be allotted to the right, with the defendant\u2019s case on the left. The arrowhead on\nthe connecting line between 2 and 3  signifies,  that  after  weighing  matters,  the  chart-maker  thinks  the  weakening\ninference discredits the testimony. The extra line on symbol 3  merely  denotes  that  this  is  evidence  offered  by  the\ndefendant in a case.\nIII. ADAPTING WIGMORE\u2019S CHART METHOD FOR BUSINESS LAW STUDENTS\nA. Factors to Consider\nThere are four major  factors  to  consider  before  adapting  the  Wigmorean  analysis  for  business  students:  (1)  the\nteaching time available; (2) the type of student; (3)  moving  the  emphasis  from  criminal  to  civil  law;  and  (4)  the\ncomputer age.\nFirst, it is unlikely that such a skills course would be allocated the same  teaching  time  as  other  substantive\nlaw courses. Indeed, one option is to integrate it into another course (e.g. Employment  Law,  Corporate  Governance,\nNegligence,  Product  Liability,  Agency,  Contract  etc.  etc.).  As  such,  the  proposed  model  could  be  used   (with\nappropriate adaptations of length,  details,  legal  topic,  and  even  jurisdiction)  where  between  one  and  four  hours\nteaching time is available.\n               Second, the most obvious feature of the students is that they are not law students,  although  it  is  likely  that\nthey would have studied some law. These students would not have spent their studies devoted entirely to legal  topics,\nabsorbing forensic techniques daily. They will come to the course without the benefit of in-depth legal  reasoning  and\nanalysis expected of law students. However, business students are at no disadvantage  simply  because  they  have  not\nstudied the rules of evidence, as Wigmore provided a method of proof, not admissibility.\nBusiness students normally are  keener  than  law  students  to  see  the  practical  benefits  of  their  learning.\nAmongst other things this means  learning  how  to  avoid  legal  problems  and  how  to  resolve  conflicts.[11]  Thus,\ndecision-making skills are useful and attractive to business students. These skills are likely  to  be  required  earlier  in\nthe process in business than they would  in  a  legal  environment.  For  instance,  for  a  human  resource  department,\nconflicts can arise and be resolved long before litigation is even contemplated or lawyers are consulted. By the time  a\nmatter comes to the lawyers, the decision-making  is  likely  to  centre  on  whether  to  go  to  trial,  or  even  the  trial\nstrategy. Where the chart method is taught on graduate courses, many students will have practical experience of  these\nmatters. This suggests that a less-technical broad-brush approach is appropriate.\n               Business students, who notoriously struggle with legal problem-solving exercises,[12] also would  hope  that\nany skills course would enhance their academic abilities. The most obvious benefit would be applying the  disciplined\nand analytical thinking required by the chart method to legal problem-solving exercises. Where students (try to) adopt\nthe conventional four-stage approach[13] of (1) identifying the issue (Wigmore\u2019s ultimate issue), (2)  stating  the  rule\n(sub-issues), (3) applying the rule to the facts provided in the  problem  (organising  and  showing  the  relevance  and\nprobative value of each fact), and (4) concluding or providing \u201cgood advice\u201d (decision-making), the benefits of \u201cchart-\nmethod thinking\u201d become obvious.\nThird,  moving  the  emphasis  toward  civil  law  need  not  be  an  obstacle  at  all.  Although   perhaps   less\nprominent, civil wrongs are made up of elements in same way as criminal offences. For instance, a  simple  breach  of\ncontract  claim  may  rest  on  whether  a  contract  existed,  with  the  elements  being  agreement,  legal   intent,   and\nconsideration.  \u201cAgreement\u201d  itself  may  be  sub-divided  into  offer  and  acceptance,  where  relevant.  In  any   case,\nbusinesses may have to deal with criminal law for a number of reasons, ranging from  corporate  fraud  to  health  and\nsafety regulations. Further, some civil claims may turn on the criminal law (and vice versa),[14]  as  illustrated  in  the\nJoyce  v.  Bingo  example  below.  So  criminal  law  is  not  redundant.  However,  other  factors  may  become   more\nprominent in the civil law arena, such as  litigation  costs,  the  amount  of  compensation  at  risk  if  the  matter  were\nlitigated, and the potential liability to others following an unfavourable precedent.[15] These factors could be relevant\nto the decision-making of an employer, worker, producer, or consumer, and so on. The Wigmore chart method cannot\naccount for these factors. So business students should  be  informed  of  these  limitations.  The  chart  focuses  on  the\nlikelihood of the truth of a particular proposition, and as such it is a major - but not necessarily the only  -  contributor\nto the decision-making process.\nFinally, back in 1913, Wigmore advised that a sharp pencil and ruler was required  for  the  task.  Of  course,\nnowadays, students would expect to draft their charts on a computer rather than by  hand.  So  suitable  software  must\nfound.\n               This shapes the  purpose  of  a  Wigmore  course  for  business  students.  First,  it  should  provide  practical\ndecision-making skills for non-lawyers working in  a  business  environment,  especially  where  the  decision-making\nmay have legal consequences. Second, it should provide academic skills,  especially  for  legal  problem-solving.  The\ntask is to provide this without losing the essence of the Wigmorean method, which is  identifying  issues,  marshalling\nfacts, and decision-making. It should enable users to identify the relevance, credibility  and  probative  value  of  facts,\nwhich means retaining the inferential skills and binary  logic  employed  by  Wigmore.  The  chart  method  inherently\ninvolves disciplined construction, analysis, and criticism of arguments.[16]\nB. The Business Law Model\nAny course should provide these skills at least at a basic level and preferably  at  a  level  that  students  could  employ\nand develop, both practically and academically. Of course, it is not necessary that students draw  a  chart  whenever  a\nproblem arises. The essence of this method is the disciplined analytical thinking  employed  during  fact  management\nand decision-making exercises. Familiarity with the Wigmore  chart  method  can  empower  students  in  these  tasks.\nMany will benefit simply by being able to visualise the necessary thought processes.\nWith these factors in mind, it becomes obvious that Wigmore\u2019s  chart  method  needs  to  be  simplified.  The\nmodel proposed here has been pared down to a minimum to show how the basic goals can  be  achieved.  Tutors  may\nrestore and develop details to suit their own requirements.\n               The major change is the abolition of a key list to  the  symbols.  Instead,  the  explanatory  words  have  been\nplaced inside text boxes, which are appropriately marked with symbols. This makes  the  chart  easier  and  quicker  to\ncomprehend, without the need to shift one\u2019s attention back and forth between the chart and the key list.  Even  a  basic\nchart will contain some 30 or so symbols (and corresponding explanations), and so this is a considerable benefit.\nThe next stage is to decide which symbols to retain. The pared down  model  retains  only  issues,  inferences\n(including  weakening  and  strengthening  ones),  evidence,  common  beliefs  (named  supposed  general   truths   by\nWigmore), and indicators of the strength of belief by the chart-maker in a fact. This retains the essence of  Wigmore\u2019s\nchart. The chart loses some of the original detail, such as marking defence or prosecution material, evidence  that  will\nbe presented to the senses of a tribunal, or some of the more detailed indicators of credibility accredited by  the  chart-\nmaker to a piece of evidence. The first two are closely associated with the trial stage and so  are  less  urgent  for  non-\nlawyers. The more detailed indicators have been discarded for two reasons. First, to make  the  chart  clearer.  Second,\nunlike the legal practitioner, students will be required (in most cases) to explain and justify their fact management and\ndecision-making. Indicators on the chart make sense to the  chart-maker,  but  less  so  to  others.  For  the  purpose  of\nteaching, it is better to require students to offer their opinions in class or by an accompanying explanatory note, which\nwould vary in length depending on the size  of  the  task.  A  written  explanation  is  necessary  if  the  work  is  to  be\nassessed. Finally, one symbol will be added. Some elements  of  any  crime  are  likely  to  be  uncontested.  Wigmore\nsensibly assumed that for practitioners this went without saying. Such an  assumption  should  not  be  made  for  non-\nlawyers. For the sake of completeness and clarity of thinking, students should indicate any uncontested elements.\nC. Appropriate Software\nThe obvious software to choose is Microsoft Office, because of  its  widespread  availability.  However,  its  flowchart\nfacility is so multi-disciplinary, fragmented and complex, it is very time-consuming and  unnecessarily  demanding  to\nset up and use. Nonetheless, a guide and example  have  been  provided  below  should  this  be  the  only  option  (see\nAppendix D). Other more dedicated software is available, such as  SmartDraw  Legal[17]  and  Rationale.[18]  Whilst\nSmartDraw offers detailed charts, Rationale provides the basic needs and is easier to use. Hence,  the  illustrations  are\nin Rationale, and a guide to use is provided in the student handout (Appendix A).\nThe Rationale Group chart allows  the  chart-maker  to  build  the  chart  box-by-box.  The  boxes  are  easily\nconnected (or disconnected), or made into sub-groups, which is useful where a large chart  needs  to  be  displayed  on\nseparate pages. These boxes can be colour coded, e.g. red to highlight a weakening inference.  Symbols  are  available\nrepresenting strengthening and weakening inferences (plus and minus signs), evidence (Quote) and  supposed  general\ntruths (Common Belief). Boxes suggesting a  proposition  can  be  marked  with  a  tick,  cross,  or  question  mark,  as\nindicators of the chart-maker\u2019s  opinion  of  the  content.  Although  this  opinion  should  explained  separately,  these\nindicators will aid the chart-maker.\nWhatever software is chosen, where the charts are to be assessed, it is better to provide just one template and\ninsist that candidates use it. As well as  minimising  the  marking  time  for  tutors,  this  will  help  the  grading  to  be\nconsistent and transparent. The content rather than the format of the chart should be assessed, and markers should  not\nbe distracted by a candidate\u2019s choice of software or format.\nD. Preparing Exercises\nWriting scenarios for any particular course is straightforward. There are plenty of models in the case  books,  or  other\nreports of first instance trials. Others may be drawn from experience in legal  practice.  Simply  convert  the  evidence\ninto a number of statements,[19] and adapt the volume of evidence according the  exercise.  To  test  inferential  skills\nfully, use circumstantial evidence. The benefit of drawing the scenarios from actual  cases  is  that  the  exercises  will\nhave a ring of truth for the practically-minded business students, enhancing the course\u2019s credibility.\nWhere necessary, the legal issues or elements raised by a problem should be specified to the students. Unlike\nlaw students, they may not be expected to know the elements of an offence or civil wrong, nor do any  legal  research.\nThe information provided will vary depending on the scenario, legal topic(s) involved, and  (perhaps)  jurisdiction.  In\nthe Joyce v Bingo exercise (below, Appendix A), students are  told  that  this  civil  matter  may  turn  on  the  criminal\noffence of theft, and so the elements of theft are provided.\nD. Grading Formal Exercises\nFormal exercises are graded according to the skills required to draft a chart. As noted above, it  is  better  the  students\nfollow a single format (using same software, symbols etc. etc.), as this helps discussions, commentary and grading.  A\nchart, with any accompanying explanatory note, should be graded according to following skills displayed:\n(a) Identifying the standpoint of the chart-maker (e.g. union official, HR manager; historian);\n(b) Collecting and ordering facts.\n(c) Identifying the relevance of the facts to the (legal) issues.\n(d) Identifying any disputed facts.\n(e) Showing the strengths and weaknesses of a case.\n(f) Making proper inferences.\nCandidates will not be expected to show:\n(a) Knowledge of categories of evidence.\n(b) Knowledge of admissibility of evidence.\n(c) Sufficiency of evidence (i.e. producing sufficient evidence on an issue in order for that evidence to be submitted to\nthe jury (or tribunal of fact).\n(d) Knowledge of any legal issues beyond those provided in the exercise.\nA piece of work can be graded according the number and quality of the skills displayed. Some may prefer  to  allocate\na particular weighting to each skill, whilst others may consider this too  restrictive  or  pedantic.  The  quality  may  be\nclassified in the context  of  the  level  of  expectation  from  the  candidates  according  to  their  level  (e.g.  graduate,\nundergraduate year one etc. etc.) and the particular institution\u2019s guidelines or practice. As this may be a  short  course,\nit might be helpful to students to indicate the weighting of the mark within their overall studies.\nE. The Classes\nWhere just one hour is  available,  the  model  could  be  used  simply  to  implant  the  necessary  thinking  processes,\nproviding the most basic skills for students to build upon and integrate into their legal  studies  and  working  life.  For\nthis purpose, simply use the lecture in Appendix A. Where more time is on hand, students can  prepare  exercises  and\ndiscuss them in class, with the goal, perhaps, of a large formal  assessment  containing  some  20  witness  statements.\nExperience showed that where larger  charts  are  required  for  the  formal  exercise  (say,  with  some  ten  to  twenty\nstatements necessitating some 70-100 symbols), at least two seminars practicing charts on that scale are desirable.\nThe model proposed here is set someplace between. It is based  on  three  hours\u2019  teaching  with  a  goal  of  a\nformally assessed exercise, containing four pieces of evidence, envisaging a chart containing  around  30-40  symbols.\nThe three-hour allocation is divided into one lecture and two seminars, each a week apart. For the sake of  illustration,\nsome of the exercises are set in Manchester, but the location can be varied, or even disregarded, as appropriate.\nIV. CLASS METHODOLOGY\nA. The Lecture\nIn the lecture, the notion of fact management is explained, along with the acquired skills and  academic  and  practical\nbenefits. Then the basic Wigmore method is explained, by first distinguishing admissibility and  proof  (this  is  easily\nillustrated using a well-known rule of evidence, such as the hearsay rule). Then, step by step, the tutor shows how  the\nbuild a chart, using a single employment case of dismissal  for  theft.  This  scheme  integrates  and  demonstrates  the\nthree basic skills (identifying issues, managing facts and decision-making). With suitable AV equipment the tutor  can\nbuild the chart on-screen for all to see. Otherwise, students can follow the process with the  incremental  charts  in  the\nhandout.[20] This is followed by a four-stage protocol  on  how  to  draft  a  chart  (Standpoint,  Issues,  Theories,  and\nDrafting). Finally, a few words on how to use the software chosen to draft the chart (with a demonstration  if  the  AV\nequipment allows).\nB. Seminar One\nThe first exercise is based on one aspect of the infamous murder trial of  Dr  Crippen.  Although  this  criminal  matter\nmay not be directly relevant to most business students, it is well-known and so has the benefit  of  engaging  students\u2019\ninterest.  Of  course,  other  examples  are  available,  which  may  be  better  known  to  the  students  in  a   particular\njurisdiction or locality, or studying a particular course.[21] Students are asked to prepare a chart on the single issue  of\nwhether the alleged victim, Mrs Crippen, was in fact dead. A suggested chart is provided in Appendix C.\nC. Seminar Two\nThis exercise is based on a  racial  discrimination  complaint,  in  the  fictional  case  of  Prince  v.  China  Centre.[22]\nStudents  should  prepare  a  chart  based  upon  four  pieces  of  evidence,  comprising  three  statements  and  the  job\nadvertisement. In addition, students should provide a written statement  (no  more  than  500  words)  explaining  their\ndecision. This exercise, being about the same size, is a dress rehearsal for the formal assignment.\nD. The Formal Assignment\nThe formal assignment, Jones v Handy Betting[23] will be on the same  scale  and  subject  matter  (here  employment\nlaw) as the exercise used for seminar two.\nAppendix A\nSTUDENT HANDOUT\nFACT MANAGEMENT AND DECISION-MAKING\nTHE WIGMORE CHART METHOD\nINTRODUCTION\n1.

Practical application in decision-making, adaptable\nfor any area, say employment, corporate responsibilities, negligence, products liability etc. etc.\n(4) Transferable into academic legal problem-solving, for instance, combined with the four-part approach to\nproblem-solving (identifying the issues, stating the rule, applying the rule, concluding (providing \u201cbest\nadvice.\u201d))\n2. What is fact management?\nOrganising and analysing facts according to relevant issues.\nFor instance, a prosecution barrister will be handed a case in the form of a bundle of documents, typically\ncontaining a statements by witnesses (and perhaps experts). It is hardly ever in any sort of order and the\nfirst tasks are to sort out this bundle and assess the strength of the case and decide whether to prosecute.\nThat is fact management.\nSimilarly, a line-manager, supervisor, or HR-manager could be presented with a \u201cbundle\u201d of facts, often\ndisorganised, and will be required access the facts to make a decision, relating to e.g. discipline, dismissal\nor a grievance.\nIn 1913, Wigmore devised and published a clinical method of doing this task.\nAlthough most lawyers would not draw up a Wigmore chart for every case, the chart represents their\nthought processes.\n3. The Wigmorean analysis\nTwo principles of Evidence\n(1) Proof\n(2) Admissibility (including sufficiency)\nWe are going to look at proof only. The Wigmore method helps to (1) identify the relevant issues, (2) organise\nand analyse the facts, and so (3) make best decisions.\nNote the limitations of this method. It does not include other factors relevant to your decision-making, such\nas the costs, or the amount of compensation at risk, if the matter were litigated. This applies from the\npotential claimant\u2019s or defendant\u2019s standpoint.\n4. Further reading\nThe articles are available via Athens. None of this reading is necessary to complete the assessment.\nPerhaps the most useful and accessible is Wigmore\u2019s original article, The Problem of Proof.\nJohn H. Wigmore, The Problem of Proof 8 Ill L Rev 77 (1913); The Science of Judicial Proof, Little, Brown\nand Company (3rd ed. 1937); Principles of Judicial Proof (Rothmans, Colorado, 1971) (1931).\nWilliam Twining, Theories of Evidence: Bentham & Wigmore (Weidenfeld and Nicholson 1985).\nTerence Anderson, David Schum and William Twining, Analysis of Evidence: How to Do Things with Facts\nBased on Wigmore\u2019s \u201cScience of Judicial Proof\u201d.

Program\nLecture - The Wigmorean analysis\nSeminar One - A single-issue chart: Dr Crippen\nSeminar Two - A full chart based upon four pieces of evidence, Prince v. China Centre\nFormal Assignment: Jones v. Handy Betting Ltd\nHAND IN DATE:\nTHE WIGMORE CHART METHOD\n1. Ultimate Issue\nThe starting point is the ultimate issue (something that must finally be proved) e.g.:\nCrippen murdered his wife.\nChina Centre discriminated against Ms Prince on the ground of race.\nBingo Ltd rightfully fired Joyce.\nNote here how the standpoint of the chart-maker varies. It may be as a historian (Crippen), a worker\n(Prince), or an employer (Bingo).\n2. Sub-Issues\nTo prove the ultimate issue it will normally be necessary to prove a number of matters which lead directly to\nit. These matters are the sub-issues. Take the example where Bingo Ltd fired Joyce for theft of company\nproperty. As the charts become more detailed, it is not strictly necessary to insert the phrase sub-issue into\nthe boxes. Simply state the facts that (if true) would correspond to the issues, and do so in the context of\nthe case. You will see this done in the more detailed examples further below.\nIn the case of Joyce v. Bingo Ltd, the issues could be charted thus:\n3.          Chains of Inference\nThe employer may review its decision to fire Joyce for a number of reasons. She may be suing for wrongful\ndismissal. Or the manager may wish to reassure himself that that an otherwise exemplary member of staff\nreally did commit the theft, perhaps with a view to rehiring her, or for writing a recommendation. So much\nwill turn on whether Joyce stole the DVD[[24]](the sub-issue on the right of the chart).\nIn most jurisdictions, to prove a case of theft the prosecution must show that there was (i) an unlawful\nappropriation (ii) of property belonging to another (iii) with, at the time, the intention of depriving that other\npermanently of the property. These have been chartered as further sub-issues (or sub-sub-issues) in the\nchart below.\nWhere legal elements form issues, the task can be quite challenging, because it is where law and fact\nmerge. You have to decide what facts are required to establish a particular legal element. The chart below\nshows this.\nThe person reviewing the evidence almost certainly does not directly know the facts. They were inferences\ndrawn from other information. In this case one piece of such information is a statement made by Bingo\u2019s\nsecurity guard. It read as follows:\n\u201cMy job is wander around the store looking for any security issues. At about 5.25, just before closing time, I\nsaw J. take a DVD disc from the shelf behind the counter for a customer. The customer apparently\nchanged his mind. Suddenly, the siren of a passing fire engine distracted people in the store. At this\nmoment, instead of replacing the DVD, J. dropped it into her handbag. I then watched her finish her duties\nand leave the store, at 5.35 pm, without paying for the DVD. Immediately afterwards I reported the matter\nto the store manager, and gave this statement.\u201d\n4. Common beliefs\nWe can see that the four facts in the second row were drawn directly from the evidence. However, those\ninferences rely upon other - external - factors as well. These are common beliefs and are represented by a\nCommon Belief symbol:\nThe object of the chart is to clarify matters - too much detail will defeat that object. So do not be too\npedantic. But the point is to remember that most inferences at least partially will be based upon common\nbeliefs, some of which are so important that they ought to be charted. It is a matter of judgment in each\ncase.\n5. Strengthening and Weakening Inferences\nNormally, any piece of the evidence is not as decisive as the security guard\u2019s statement first suggests:  the\nstore may have been crowded at the time, giving him only an interrupted view of the defendant; or the fire\nengine may have distracted the guard also. On the other hand, the assistant manager may be able to\nconfirm her security guard\u2019s statement. Alternative theories might be that Joyce paid for the DVD earlier\nthe day, or that she merely borrowed it to watch that evening. Represent strengthening inferences with a\nplus symbol in a green box, and weakening inferences by with a minus symbol in a red box.\n\nHere, the chart-maker has evaluated the evidence and decided that the assistant manager\u2019s confirmation\noutweighs any doubts of mistaken observation, and uses a tick symbol to indicate a belief in the\nproposition.\nAnother argument may be that Joyce paid for the DVD earlier in the day (note the common belief used\nhere).\n6. Uncontested Facts.\nSome issues may be uncontested and so require no proof. For instance, it is unlikely that either party\nwould deny the employment contract.[[25]] Show this on your chart with a green box:\n7. Larger charts\nWhere the chart becomes too large to be legible on one sheet of paper, transfer one or more branches to a\nseparate page. Mark the original thus:\nHOW TO PREPARE A CHART[26]\n1. Clarify standpoint.[27]\nIt is important to identify (i) you role, (ii) the objective, (iii) the materials available, and (iv) the time you come to  the\nmatter.\nYour role could be a manager or supervisor, or trade union official, evaluating a worker\u2019s grievance or an  employer\u2019s\ndecision to take disciplinary action or dismissal. To do this you will need to evaluate the  strength  of  your  -  and  the\nworker\u2019s - case. The objective, of course, is the best possible outcome, but this could vary. For example, as a manager\nyou may desire a compromise to preserve goodwill. Alternatively, where legal action is a possibility, you may aim for\na decision that is safe legally. As a trade union official your  primary  objective  may  be  a  complete  victory  for  the\nworker.\nYou should also consider the materials\/evidence available to you. For example, some witnesses  may  be  reluctant  to\ncome forward, yet could be subpoenaed should the matter reach litigation. If there are gaps in the material, you should\naccount for this.[28]\nThe time when you come to matter could decide your objective. For instance, as a supervisor at  the  early  stage  of  a\ngrievance, you wish to resolve the matter informally and preserve goodwill. On the other hand, if  litigation  is  likely,\nyou may be aiming for a safe decision, for example, by  not  making  informal  concessions  that  could  prejudice  the\nemployer at trial.\nIn other scenarios you may be studying the evidence as an barrister, deciding whether to go ahead with a  prosecution.\nOr you may be a historian, reviewing the evidence  relating  to  a  cause  celebre  (such  as  Dr  Crippen,  below).\nHere, you may be trying to show that a convict was in fact innocent. This of course would be  in  retrospect,\nperhaps with new evidence, and outside of court\n2. Establish the ultimate issue and the sub-issues.\nHere you must first understand the elements of the alleged wrongdoing. For instance, in most jurisdictions,\nto prove a case of theft the prosecution must show that there was (i) an unlawful appropriation (ii) of\nproperty belonging to another (iii) with, at the time, the intention of depriving that other permanently of the\nproperty. Thus if you were minded to fire a worker for theft, you could evaluate the evidence according to\nthese elements. In a typical claim for direct discrimination, the claimant (i) must be a worker\/applicant, and\n(ii) must belong to a protected group (e.g. by race, sex etc.), and (iii) be less favourably treated (iv)\nbecause of that claimant\u2019s race, or sex etc.\nThere is no need for legal research, as the relevant legal elements are provided for each exercise.\n3. Develop your theories.\nYou should formulate the strongest theories for each side. In the Joyce v Bingo case, for instance, one theory\nshould be that Joyce stole the DVD, by slipping it in her bag whilst people were distracted, and then\nleaving without making payment. On the other side, the theory may be that she did not take the DVD at all\n(witness was distracted), or that she had paid for it earlier. (More than one theory is permissible.)\nYou should show the strongest case for each side. You may wish to draft a separate chart for the defence,\nor integrate it with weakening inferences (as done in the illustrations).\n4. Drafting your chart\nDraft the chart from top to bottom and from right to left. Where there is choice, place the most important\nsymbols to the right, say evidence to the right of a common belief, as shown above in \u201c5. Strengthening\nand Weakening Inferences.\u201d Place strengthening inferences to the right of a proposition, and weakening\ninferences to the left.\nRemember that the chart works on binary logic, with every proposition tending support or undermine the\nultimate issue. Work on the basis that one box stands for one proposition and no more.\nSOFTWARE TO DRAFT YOUR CHART\nIn Rationale (Austhink.com) click File in the top left corner, then click New.

Crippen[[29]]\nThe mild-mannered Doctor Hawley Crippen and his showgirl wife, both Americans, lived together in London.\nAcquaintances said their marriage had disintegrated, with Cora Crippen teasing her husband by taking a\nstring of lovers. Meanwhile the cuckolded Dr Crippen fell in love with Ethel Le Neve. The prosecution\u2019s\ntheory was that the Doctor poisoned his wife, clinically dismembered her body, and buried her corpse\nunder the cellar of their home; a grisly crime of passion perpetrated by a ruthless and dangerous man,\nallowing him to spend the rest of his life with his mistress. He was found guilty and hanged on 23\nNovember 1910.\n               One problem for the prosecution was proving that Cora Crippen was in fact dead. For some time after her\ndisappearance, Dr Crippen told friends that his wife had died when visiting California. When interviewed by\nInspector Dew of Scotland Yard, Crippen changed his story. The embarrassing truth, he confessed, was\nthat she had left him for another man.\n               However, the persistent Inspector searched the Crippen home several times and after his cane slipped on a\nloose brick in the cellar floor, he discovered some buried human remains. The head, bones and some organs had all\nbeen clinically removed, rendering it impossible to tell if the remains were male or female, let alone those of\nMrs Cora Crippen.\n               But there was a clue. There was a mark in the shape of an isosceles triangle on the abdomen. Cora\nCrippen\u2019s sister testified that, when young, Cora Crippen had undergone an operation on her abdomen. A\nprosecution expert testified that this mark was consistent with an abdominal operation some years earlier,\nallowing for spread as the person got fatter as she aged. However, a defence expert stated that the mark\nwas more consistent with a fold in the skin than a scar. Inspector Dew testified to the finding of the\nremains. Whilst the experts gave their evidence, a saucer containing the relevant piece of flesh was shown\nto the jury. The decision was theirs.\nDraft a Wigmore chart to represent:\n1. The ultimate issue;\n2. The sub-issues;\n3. Extend the chart only to display the evidence as to whether or not the remains found were those of Mrs\nCrippen. Use only the information given above.\nAt the time, English common law held that murder consisted of (i) the unlawful killing, (ii) of a person in being, (iii)\nunder the King\u2019s peace, (iv) with malice aforethought, (v) and death occurring within a year and a day.\nEXERCISE TWO - SEMINAR TWO\nPrince v. The China Cultural Exchange Centre[[30]]\nMs Prince, of Chinese origin, failed in her application for the post of Deputy Director of the Centre. She now\nalleges that the China Centre rejected her because of her Chinese origin.\nYou are the HR Officer charged with deciding whether to settle this claim, or fight it in litigation. Assume that a\ntribunal would admit all the evidence. Your first task is to decide whether Prince has a credible case of\ndirect discrimination.\nFrom the information provided (below) draft a Wigmore chart showing the supporting and opposing\nevidence to her case. Write an accompanying note explaining (1) the credibility of each piece of evidence\ncharted, (2) your belief in any fact charted, (3) any inferences that require further information, (4) whether\nPrince has a credible case of direct race discrimination, and (5) any other explanations you consider\nnecessary. This note should be no longer than 500 words.\nThe law: the claimant (i) must be a worker\/applicant, and (ii) must belong to a racial group, and (iii) be less\nfavourably treated by the Defendant (iv) because of that claimant\u2019s race. Note that Prince\u2019s Chinese origin\nqualifies her as belonging to a racial group.\nThe Manchester Bugle 24 March 2009.\nEmployment Opportunities - Executive\nDeputy Director\nCHINA CULTURAL EXCHANGE CENTRE\n\u2022 Reference: CA 07-08\/25\n\u2022 Location: , Manchester.\n\u2022 Industry: Public Sector Non-Governmental Organisation\no Senior executive - General,\no Senior executive - Public sector\n\u2022 Contract: Permanent\n\u2022 Hours: Full Time\nSalary: Starting Salary \u00a334,508\nAn exciting opportunity has arisen to work in the China Cultural Exchange Centre, based in Manchester.\nWe are looking for a bright committed candidate to carry out the functions commensurate of a deputy\ndirector of an international organisation, with a view eventually to succeed to current director.\nThe Deputy Director\u2019s duties include detailed arrangements for exchange visits between\nManchester and China, providing information to enquirers, editorship of the three-monthly newsletter and\nroutine accounting duties, as well as deputising for the director in the latter\u2019s absence. The Deputy Director\nmust have an excellent command of Chinese especially the spoken language with first hand experience of\nChina. The Deputy Director makes a working visit to China about once a year.\nClosing Date: 5pm Wednesday 13 April 2009\nFor further information and how to apply, please visit our website at www.Chinaexcentre.gov.uk\nMs Prince\u2019s letter of complaint\n28 April 2009\nDear Ms Orf,\nOn 1 April 2009, I applied for the post of Deputy Director of your Centre. I attended an interview on 20 April.\nI was most upset to receive your letter of rejection dated 25 April, and the reasons given make no sense to\nme.\nAs you are aware, I am of Chinese origin, had the requisite experience and qualifications. I speak fluent Chinese\n(Mandarin) and am familiar with China, having lived there until aged 21, and having made several return visits to\nrelatives. (Although I have not visited for some 5 years). I have an upper-second class honours degree in\neconomics from Manchester Metropolitan University.\nI noticed at the interview, that out of eight candidates, I was the only non-white person. Further, no one on\nthe interview panel (comprising four persons) was of Chinese origin, indeed, all the other staff I saw there\nwere white English persons. In short, I felt that \u2018my face didn\u2019t fit\u2019.\nMy sad, but inevitable conclusion is that I was not chosen because of my Chinese origin, and I consider this to be\nracial discrimination. If you do not settle this matter promptly, I will have no choice but to instigate formal\nproceedings.\nYours sincerely,\nMs Prince\nChina Exchange Centre\u2019s letter of rejection\n25 April 2009\nDear Ms Prince,\nIt is with regret we inform you that you were not successful on this occasion in your application for the post of\nDeputy Director. There was an extremely strong field of candidates.\nYours sincerely,\nMs N. Orf\nHR Manager\nStatement of chair of the interview panel.\nMr V. Biast\nThe panel considered that Ms Prince was not suitable because she had made no recent visits to China and the job\nrequires recent Chinese experience; her employment history shows that she had changed jobs frequently,\nwhich counted against her because we were looking for a person with the long-term potential to succeed\nthe Director; and her work experience is mainly in journalism, which by its nature involves independent\nwork, which might make her less amenable to working closely with the Director.\nThe successful candidate was a female aged 24 and white. She had a degree in modern languages with\nupper second-class honours in Chinese from Manchester Metropolitan University, which involved spending\na year studying in China. Since graduating, aged 22, she worked continually (for 18 months) as a civil\nservant in social security. She also gained work experience during her university vacations. We considered\nthat her recent Chinese experience and relatively stable employment record made her the most suitable\ncandidate.\nI acknowledge that all 24 members of staff (including the interview panel) at the China Centre are white, as were\nall the short-listed candidates, bar Ms Prince. But we are an equal opportunities employer. We choose our\nstaff on merit only. Ethnic minority candidates should expect no special favours.\nSigned\nDated: 3 May 2009\nEXERCISE 3 - FORMAL ASSIGNMENT\nJones v. Handy Betting Ltd.\nMr Jones worked as one of three shift managers in the Manchester branch of Handy Betting, which is one\nof a chain of betting shops owned by the employer. Along with the other two managers, Mr Jones holds a\nkey to the shop\u2019s safe. Last week he was fired, apparently for theft. He has now written to the company\u2019s\nHR department, complaining that he was fired not because of the theft, but because of his race. It is\nuncontested that Jones\u2019 co-managers, the area manager, and the appeal panel were white, whilst Mr\nJones is black.\nYou are the HR Officer charged with deciding whether to settle this claim. Assume that a tribunal would\nadmit all the evidence. Your first task is to decide whether Jones has a credible case of direct race\ndiscrimination.\nFrom the information provided (below) draft a Wigmore chart showing the supporting and opposing\nevidence to his case. Write an accompanying note explaining (1) the credibility of each piece of evidence\ncharted, (2) your belief in any fact charted, (3) any inferences that require further information, (4) whether\nJones has a credible case of direct discrimination, and (5) any other explanations you consider necessary.\nThis note should be no longer than 500 words.\nThe law: the claimant (i) must be a worker\/applicant, and (ii) must belong to a racial group, and (iii) be less\nfavourably treated (iv) because of that claimant\u2019s race.\nMr Jones\u2019 letter of complaint\n1 August 2009\nDear Ms Golightly,\nAs you might be aware, I have worked for several years in the Manchester branch of Handy Betting and\nhave never received a complaint about my work. I share the managing of the shop with two others, one\nJohn Handy, and one Elizabeth Handy, who are the son and daughter respectively of the business\u2019s owner\nPeter Handy. We work shifts. The shop is open from 7am to 11pm, Monday to Saturday. We normally work\nseparate shifts, and at times (typically weekday mornings or late evenings) each of us could be alone in the\nshop, but at busy times (such as Saturdays) two of us are likely to work the same shift, along with other\nmembers of staff.\nLast Tuesday the area manager made an unannounced visit to the shop, and fired me on the spot. He said\nit was because over several weeks money had gone missing from the shop\u2019s safe, and I was the only\nsuspect.\nI was shocked and now very upset. I wish to appeal against this decision because I am wholly innocent of\nany theft from the company.\nYours,\nPaul Jones\nHandy Betting\u2019s response\n8 August 2009\nDear Mr Jones,\nAfter hearing your appeal, I regret to inform you that it was unsuccessful. The panel unanimously agreed\nthat, despite your unblemished employment history with us, it was perfectly logical to hold you responsible\nfor the theft of money from the shop safe, as you spend time alone in the shop and have a key to the safe.\nThe only other two key-holders were close and trusted relatives of the owner of the business, and so could\nnot be considered suspects. The area manager had no option but to dismiss you.\nYours sincerely,\nMs Anne Golightly\nHead of Human Resources and Chair of the Appeal Panel,\nHandy Betting Ltd\nStatement of Area Manager\n4 August 2009\nI am the area manager for Handy Betting Ltd, and have responsibility for the overall running and security of\nour outlets in Manchester. In July 2009 it came to my attention that on three occasions cash had been\nstolen from the safe of the Manchester branch. Only three persons have the key to that safe, Paul Jones,\nJohn Handy, and Elizabeth Handy. As John and Elizabeth are the children of the business\u2019 owner, I did not\nsuspect them. So I confronted the only suspect, Paul Jones. It was important for obvious reasons that\ndishonest workers do not remain on the premises. He denied stealing the money, but I had little choice but\nto fire him. He became verbally aggressive, but I affected an American accent and told him: \u201cGet your sorry\nblack ass out of here.\u201d I now regret that statement, but it had nothing to do with my decision to fire him.\nAfter that Paul Jones immediately collected his belongings and left.\nSigned\nDouglas Sarky\nMr Jones\u2019 Response to the Appeal Panel\u2019s Decision\n12 August 2009\nDear Ms Golightly,\nI acknowledge the receipt of your letter dates 8 August denying my appeal.\nI still protest my innocence and as a black person, I think I have lost my job because of my race, and not\nany proper evidence of dishonesty. Douglas Sarky made that very plain when he fired me. I add the\nobservation that the area manager, my co-managers, and the appeal panel of three were all white persons.\nIn fact, I was the only black person involved.\nIf you do not reconsider, I will instigate formal proceedings for racial discrimination.\nYours sincerely,\nPaul Jones\nAppendix B\nPrince v.

Great Britain China Centre [1992] I.C.R. 516 (Court of\nAppeal), where the claimant prevailed.\n[23] This exercise is inspired by two British cases: Igen (formally Leeds  Careers  Guidance)  v.  Wong  [2005]  I.C.R.\n931 (Court of Appeal) where a black worker won her claim for  discriminatory  dismissal  confirmed  by  an  all-white\nappeal panel, and Frames Snooker v. Boyce [1996] I.R.L.R. 472 (Employment  Appeal  Tribunal),  where  a  manager\nwas fairly dismissed for theft, even though the owner\u2019s daughter (who was not dismissed) also had access to the safe.\n[24]Alternatively, as (in the United Kingdom), an employer can defend an Unfair Dismissal claim by showing it acted\n\u201creasonably.\u201d In a case such as this, it would have to show only that it held a reasonable belief that Joyce stole the\nDVD. Unlike breach of contract claims (wrongful dismissal), it is not necessary to prove that the worker actually\ncommitted the wrongful act: British Home Stores v. Burchell [1980] I.C.R. 303 (Employment Appeal Tribunal),\napproved Foley v. Post Office [2000] I.C.R. 1283 (Court of Appeal). Cf Boston Deep Sea Fishing & Ice Co. v.\nAnsell (1888) 39 Ch. D. 339 (Court of Appeal).\n[25] The causative issue (Bingo fired Joyce because she stole the DVD) can be particularly decisive in UK Unfair\nDismissal claims, where the employer cannot use retrospective evidence or reasons to justify a dismissal. So if she\nwere fired for another reason, she may prevail irrespective of whether she stole the DVD.\n[26] For a detailed \u2018seven-step protocol\u2019 for doing this see Anderson et al (2005), supra note 7, at 124-134.\n[27] Anderson et al have developed the standpoint from the original model, see Anderson et al (2005),  supra  note  7,\nat  p 115-117.\n[28] \u2018The failure to identify an objective that can be achieved based on the materials available is a common error  that\ncan have serious consequences.\u2019 (Anderson et al (2005), supra note 7, at  116).\n[29] This exercise is based on one provided by Christopher Allen, of the Inns  of  Court  School  of  Law,  London.
