Lynch\u20212\nFrom the \u2021Trinity College Institute for Neuroscience, Physiology Department, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland and the \u00a7School of\nPharmacy, University of Bradford, Bradford BD7 DP, United Kingdom\nInflammatory changes, characterized by an increase in pro-\ninflammatory cytokineproduction andup-regulationof the cor-\nresponding signaling pathways, have been described in the\nbrains of aged rats and rats treated with the potent immune\nmodulatory molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These changes\nhave been coupled with a deficit in long-term potentiation\n(LTP) in hippocampus. The evidence suggests that anti-inflam-\nmatory agents, which attenuate the LPS-induced and age-asso-\nciated increase in hippocampal interleukin-1\u0001 (IL-1\u0001) concen-\ntration, lead to restoration of LTP. Here we report that\natorvastatin, a member of the family of agents that act as inhib-\nitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, exerts\npowerful anti-inflammatory effects in brain and that these\neffects are mediated by IL-4 and independent of its cholesterol-\nlowering actions. Treatment of rats with atorvastatin increased\nIL-4 concentration in hippocampal tissue prepared from LPS-\ntreated and aged rats and abrogated the age-related and LPS-\ninduced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferon-\u0002\n(IFN\u0002) and IL-1\u0001, and the accompanying deficit in LTP. The\neffect of atorvastatin on the LPS-induced increases in IFN\u0002 and\nIL-1\u0001 was absent in tissue prepared from IL-4\u0003\/\u0003 mice. The\nincrease in IL-1\u0001 in LPS-treated and aged rats is associatedwith\nincreased microglial activation, assessed by analysis of major\nhistocompatibility complex II expression, and the evidence sug-\ngests that IFN\u0002may trigger this activation.We propose that the\nprimary effect of atorvastatin is to increase IL-4, which antago-\nnizes the effects of IFN\u0002, the associated increase in microglial\nactivation, and the subsequent cascade of events.\nThe adverse effects of inflammation in the brain have been\nshown to include down-regulation of synaptic function. One\nmanifestation of this is a decrease in the ability of rats to sustain\nlong-termpotentiation (LTP),3 a formof synaptic plasticity that\nis considered to be a potential biological substrate for learning\nand\/or memory. Inflammatory changes, typified by an increase\nin concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleu-\nkin-1\u0001 (IL-1\u0001), have been observed in aged rats (1, 2) and in rats\ntreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS (3, 4)) or \u0001-amyloid pep-\ntides (A\u0001 (5)). In each of these conditions, LTP is impaired and,\nin some cases, the impairment is abrogated by strategies that\nrestore IL-1\u0001 concentration to the lower values observed in\ncontrol conditions (4). A role for IL-4 inmodulating IL-1\u0001 pro-\nduction has been demonstrated (6), and we have observed that\ntwo treatments with anti-inflammatory properties, the polyun-\nsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (6) and rosiglita-\nzone,4 abrogate age- and LPS-induced neuroinflammation by\nincreasing IL-4 concentration in hippocampus. These data\nhighlight the potential of anti-inflammatory treatments to\nrestore functional deficits associated with inflammation and\ndraw an interesting parallel with the observation that the inci-\ndence of Alzheimer disease is reduced in individuals undergo-\ning anti-inflammatory treatments for other conditions (7).\nIt seems likely that the increase in IL-1\u0001 concentration in the\nbrain in inflammatory conditions is derived from activated\nmicroglia, and therefore parallel changes in IL-1\u0001 concentra-\ntion and microglial activation have been identified in brain of\naged and LPS-treated rats (8). However, the trigger leading to\nactivation of microglia has not been identified, although results\nfrom several studies have suggested that one of themost potent\nactivators of microglia in vitro is interferon-\u0002 (IFN\u0002 (9\u201311)).\nRecent work has identified anti-inflammatory properties of\n3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors\n(i.e. statins) that are distinct from their ability to lower choles-\nterol. It has been shown that statins reduce A\u0001 deposition and\ninflammatory changes in mouse models of Alzheimer disease\n(12\u201314), block paralysis in chronic and relapsing experimental\nautoimmune encephalomyelitis (15), reduce infarct size in\nischemia, and improve neurologic outcome by directly up-reg-\nulating brain endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (16). Statins\nhave also been shown to decrease symptoms and mortality in\nstroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (17).\nBecause of their reported anti-inflammatory effects, it might\nbe predicted that statins will counteract the inflammatory\nchanges induced by age and by LPS treatment. To test this pre-\ndiction, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin treatment on\nthe age-related and LPS-induced changes in rat hippocampus.\nWe report that the age- and LPS-associated microglial activa-\ntion, increase in concentrations of IFN\u0002 and IL-1\u0001, and deficit\n* The costs of publication of this articlewere defrayed in part by the payment\nof page charges.

Because\natorvastatin failed to attenuate the LPS-induced increases in\ncytokine concentrations in tissue prepared from IL-4\u0001\/\u0001mice,\nwe propose that the primary action of atorvastatin may be to\ntrigger production of IL-4 and thereby prevent the IFN\u0002-in-\nduced microglial activation.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nAnimals\u2014Twenty-four, 2- to 3-month-old male Wistar rats\n(BioResources Unit, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland), were\nused in the first study, and 18 aged (22\u201324 months) and 12\nyoung (3\u20134 months) animals (Bantham and Kingman, UK)\nwere used in the second study. We also used 24 2- to 5-month-\nold C57BL\/6 (Harlan UK Ltd.) and C57BL\/6 IL-4-defective (IL-\n4\u0001\/\u0001)mice (B&KUniversal, UK). Ratswere housed in groups of\n2\u20136, and mice were housed singly, under a 12-h light schedule.\nAmbient temperature was controlled between 22 and 23 \u00b0C,\nand animals were maintained under veterinary supervision\nthroughout the study. These experiments were performed\nunder a license issued by the Department of Health (Ireland)\nand with ethical approval from the local ethical review group.\nAtorvastatin Treatment Regimen\u2014Food and water intake\nwas assessed daily for 1 week, and animals were then randomly\nassigned to a control treatment or atorvastatin treatment\ngroup. Atorvastatin (5 and 10 mg\/kg\/day in the case of rats and\nmice, respectively; Lipitor, Pfizer-Parke Davis, Ireland) was\ngiven orally for 3 weeks in the laboratory chow. In the first and\nthird studies, the control- and atorvastatin-treated groups of\nrats and mice were subsequently subdivided into those that\nreceived saline intraperitoneally and those that received LPS\n(100 \u0003g\/kg Escherichia coli serotype 0111.B4, Sigma-Aldrich,\nUK) intraperitoneally on the day of the experiment. In the sec-\nond study, young and aged rats were subdivided into control-\nand atorvastatin-treated groups, and treatment continued for 8\nweeks. Rats and mice were given their daily allowance of food\nand monitored to ensure that they received their full daily dose\nof atorvastatin. Animals were weighed at intervals throughout\nthe study to ensure that similar weight changes were occurring\nin the different treatment groups. At the end of the treatment\nperiod, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, the brain was\nrapidly removed, dissected on ice, sliced (350\u0002 350\u0003m) using\na McIlwain tissue chopper, and stored in Krebs buffer contain-\ning CaCl2 (1.13 mM) and 10% Me2SO at \u000180 \u00b0C as previously\ndescribed (1) until required for analysis. Rats were assessed for\ntheir ability to sustain LTP.\nInduction of LTP in Vivo\u2014Young rats were anesthetized by\nintraperitoneal injection of urethane (1.5 g\/kg), and aged rats\nwere initially given 1.2 g\/kg urethane with further increments\nto a maximum of 2.0 g\/kg when required. The absence of a\npedal reflex was considered to be an indicator of deep anesthe-\nsia. In the case of the experiments in which the effect of atorv-\nastatin was assessed on LPS-induced changes, LPS (100 \u0003g\/kg,\nSigma, UK) or saline was injected intraperitoneally and 3 h later\nanimals were assessed for their ability to sustain LTP. In some\nexperiments rats were injected intracerebroventricularly (2.5\nmm posterior, and 0.5 mm lateral, to Bregma) with IFN\u0002 (50\nng\/ml, 5\u0003l, Chemicon International, Inc.), IL-4 (20 ng\/ml, 5\u0003l,\nR&D Systems, UK) or both, and 30 min later these rats were\nassessed for their ability to sustain LTP in perforant path-gran-\nule cell synapses as described previously (1). Briefly, a bipolar-\nstimulating electrode and a unipolar-recording electrode were\nstereotaxically positioned in the perforant path (4.4 mm lateral\nto lambda) and dorsal cell body region of the dentate gyrus (3.9\nmm posterior, and 2.5 mm lateral, to Bregma), respectively.\nTest shockswere delivered at 30-s intervals, and recorded for 10\nmin before and 45 min after tetanic stimulation. The stimula-\ntion paradigm used involved delivery of 3 trains of stimuli (250\nHz for 200 ms) with an intertrain interval of 30 s, which has\nbeen shown to induce saturable LTP in perforant path-granule\ncell synapses in young adult rats (18); this stimulation paradigm\nhas revealed a deficit in LTP in aged rats.\nAt the end of the recording period, rats were killed by decap-\nitation, the brains were rapidly removed, and the hippocampus\nwas dissected. One-third of the hippocampus was flash-frozen\nin liquid N2 for later analysis of mRNA (see below), and slices\n(350\u0002 350\u0003m) were prepared from the rest of the tissue using\na McIlwain tissue chopper. These slices were stored in Krebs\nbuffer containing CaCl2 (1.13 mM) and 10% Me2SO at \u000180 \u00b0C\nas previously described (1) until required for analysis. Cortical\ntissue was similarly prepared and stored for later analysis of\ncholesterol.\nAnalysis of IL-1\u0001, IFN-\u0002, and IL-4\u2014The concentrations of\nIL-1\u0001, IFN\u0002, and IL-4 were assessed by enzyme-linked immu-\nnosorbent assay (R&D Systems, UK) in the stored hippocampal\nslices prepared from rats (2). IFN\u0002 and IL-1\u0001 concentrations\nwere also assessed in tissue prepared from wild-type and\nIL-4\u0001\/\u0001 mice. Slices were thawed, rinsed, homogenized, and\nequalized for protein (19). For analysis of rat tissue the follow-\ning antibodies were used to coat 96-well plates; 1.0 \u0003g\/ml goat\nanti-rat IL-1\u0001 antibody (R&D Systems, UK), or 2.0 \u0003g\/ml\nmouse anti-rat IFN\u0002 antibody, or 2.0\u0003g\/mlmouse anti-rat IL-4\nantibody (diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3). For\nanalysis of tissue prepared from mice, 1.25 \u0003g\/ml goat anti-\nmouse IFN\u0002 antibody (BIOSOURCE,UK) or 4\u0003g\/ml goat anti-\nmouse IL-1\u0001 antibody (R&D Systems, UK) were used. Plates\nwere incubated overnight at room temperature, washed,\nblocked, and incubated with standards (0\u20131000 pg\/ml) or sam-\nples for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed and incu-\nbated with the following antibodies: 350 ng\/ml biotinylated\ngoat anti-rat antibody for IL-1\u0001, 150 ng\/ml biotinylated goat\nanti-rat antibody for IFN\u0002, or 50 ng\/ml biotinylated goat anti-\nrat antibody for IL-4, each diluted in phosphate-buffered saline\ncontaining 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum, or 100 ng\/ml\nbiotinylated goat anti-mouse IL-1\u0001 antibody, and 125 ng\/ml\nbiotinylated goat anti-mouse IFN\u0002 antibody (R&D Systems,\nUK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:200)\nand substrate solution (1:1 mixture of H2O2 and tetramethyl-\nbenzidine) were added, incubation continued in the dark for\n20\u201330 min, and the reaction was stopped using 1 M H2SO4.\nAbsorbance was read at 450 nm, and values were corrected for\nprotein in the case of homogenates and expressed as pico-\ngrams\/mg of protein.\nAnalysis of Expression of MHCII\u2014We assessed OX6 mRNA\nexpression as an indicator of MHCII. Total RNA was extracted\nfrom hippocampal tissue using TRI reagent (Sigma), reverse\ntranscription-PCR was undertaken (5), and cDNA synthesis\nIL-4 in Atorvastatin-associated Neuroprotection\nJANUARY 25, 2008\u2022VOLUME 283\u2022NUMBER 4 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 1809\n by guest, on Decem\nber 16, 2010\nw\nw\nw\n.jbc.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nwas performed on 1 \u0003g of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers\n(Superscript reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen Ltd., UK).

The cycling conditions were\n95 \u00b0C for 300 s, 65 \u00b0C for 60 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 120 s. The reaction\nwas stopped by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. These\nprimers generated OX-6 PCR products at 245 bp and \u0001-actin\nPCR products at 250 bp. Equal volumes of PCR product from\neach sample were loaded onto 1.5% agarose gels, and bands\nwere separated by application of 90 V, photographed, and\nquantified using densitometry. The target genes were normal-\nized to \u0001-actin mRNA expression (i.e. the housekeeping gene).\nNo change in \u0001-actin mRNA was observed with treatment.\nWestern Immunoblot Analysis of JNK, c-Jun, p38, and NF\u0004B\u2014\nPhosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, p38, and NF\u0004B was analyzed in\nsamples prepared from hippocampal tissue as described for\nanalysis of JNKphosphorylation (20); JNKphosphorylationwas\nassessed in nuclear and cytosolic fractions and c-Jun phospho-\nrylation, p38, and NF\u0004B activation in nuclear fractions only.\nThe cytosolic fraction was prepared by homogenizing hip-\npocampal slices in lysis buffer (composition in mM: 20 HEPES,\npH 7.4, 10 KCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 1 dithiothreitol,\n0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, containing pepstatin A (5\n\u0003g\/ml), leupeptin (2\u0003g\/ml), and aprotinin (2\u0003g\/ml)), incubat-\ning for 20min on ice, and centrifuging (15,000\u0002 g for 10min at\n4 \u00b0C).

Blots\nwere stripped (Reblot Plus, Chemicon) and reprobed with an\nanti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); in the case\nof JNK, c-Jun, and NF\u0004B, antibodies raised against the\nunphosphorylated form were used to confirm equal loading.\nCholesterol Analysis\u2014NMR spectra were recorded at\nroom temperature on a JEOL ECA600 NMR spectrometer\noperating at 600-Hz proton frequency. The spectra were\nacquired in the Fourier transformation mode with 32 K data\npoints, using a 45\u00b0 pulse width. The residual monodeuter-\nated water signal at \u00044.7 ppm was suppressed by the appli-\ncation of a continuous and selective secondary irradiation\nduring the relaxation delay. Chemical shifts were referenced\nto the residual methanol peak at 3.31 ppm. Spectral assign-\nments were made by reference to data already in the litera-\nture (21, 22). Cholesterol was identified and quantified by its\ncharacteristic C-18 methyl singlet at 0.68 ppm.\nStatistical Analysis\u2014Data were analyzed, as appropriate, using\neitherStudent\u2019s t test for independentmeansora two-wayanalysis\nof variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Student Newman-\nKeuls test to determinewhich conditionswere significantly differ-\nent from each other.

The present results\nsupport these observations and\nshow that, in parallel with the\nincreases in IL-1\u0001 concentration\nand JNK and p38 activation, LTP is\nimpaired in LPS-treated animals.\nThus, high frequency stimulation of\nthe perforant path led to an imme-\ndiate and sustained increase in pop-\nulation EPSP slope in control rats,\nwhereas LTP was markedly attenu-\nated in rats injected with LPS (p \u0005\n0.001, ANOVA, Fig. 3a).

Because previous evidence indicated that\nIFN\u0002 triggers activation ofmicroglia in vitro (24) we considered\nthat it might also trigger the response observed here in vivo.\nMean IFN\u0002 concentration was significantly increased in tissue\nprepared from LPS-treated rats (*, p\u0005 0.05, ANOVA, Fig. 4a),\nand this was attenuated by atorvastatin so that IFN\u0002 concen-\ntrationwas similar in tissue prepared fromLPS-treated rats that\nreceived atorvastatin and in tissue prepared from control-\ntreated rats.\nIL-4 Mediates the Effects of Atorvastatin and Blocks IFN\u0002-\ninduced Changes\u2014It has been reported that atorvastatin can\ninduce a Th2 response characterized by increased secretion of\nanti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4 (15); because of this and\nbecause we have previously shown that IL-4 inhibits LPS-in-\nduced changes in hippocampus (3), we considered that the\naction of atorvastatin might be mediated by IL-4. We report\nthat IL-4 concentration was significantly enhanced in hip-\npocampal tissue prepared from atorvastatin-treated compared\nwith control-treated rats (*, p\u0005 0.05, ANOVA, Fig. 4b) but that\nIL-4 concentration was significantly decreased in tissue pre-\npared from LPS-treated rats that did not receive atorvastatin\ncompared with those that did (\u0006, p\u0005 0.05, ANOVA, Fig. 4b). If\nIL-4 mediates the effects of atorvastatin, then it must be pre-\ndicted that atorvastatin will not exert any effect in tissue pre-\npared from IL-4\u0001\/\u0001 mice, and to check this we compared its\neffect on LPS-induced changes in these and wild-type mice.

In con-\ntrast, whereas LPS increased IFN\u0002 and IL-1\u0001, albeit insignifi-\ncantly, in samples prepared from IL-4\u0001\/\u0001 mice, there was no\nevidence of an effect of atorvastatin in these animals.\nIf IL-4 mediates the effect of atorvastatin, and if the key LPS-\ninduced action leading to degenerative change is an increase in\nIFN\u0002, then it must be predicted that IL-4, like atorvastatin, will\nantagonize the effects of IFN\u0002. Intracerebroventricular injec-\ntion of IFN\u0002 significantly increased hippocampal MHCII\nmRNA expression, IL-1\u0001 concentration, and JNK activation\n(**, p\u0005 0.01, ANOVA, Fig. 5, a\u2013c), and these effects were atten-\nuated in tissue prepared from rats treated with IFN\u0002 and IL-4\n(\u0006, p\u0005 0.05 in the case of MHCII expression and \u0006\u0006, p\u0005 0.01\nin the case of JNK activation, ANOVA). Consistent with our\nprevious findings, the increases in microglial activation, IL-1\u0001\nconcentration, and JNK activation were coupled with a deficit\nin LTP. Thus LTP was significantly attenuated in IFN\u0002-treated\nrats (Fig. 6, a and b); the mean percentage changes in popula-\ntion EPSP slope in the last 10min of the experiment (compared\nwith the mean value in the 5 min prior to stimulation), were\n129.9\u0007 0.72 in control-treated rats and 86.36\u0007 0.73 in IFN\u0002-\ntreated animals (***, p \u0005 0.001, ANOVA, Fig. 6b). IL-4 treat-\nment completely abrogated the effect of IFN\u0002; the mean per-\ncentage change in population EPSP slope was 135.1 \u0007 0.81,\nwhich was not significantly different from that in control-\ntreated rats, but was significantly greater than the value\nobserved in rats that received IFN\u0002 alone (\u0006\u0006\u0006, p \u0005 0.001,\nANOVA, Fig. 6b).\nAtorvastatin Attenuates the Age-related Inflammatory\nChanges and the Deficit in LTP\u2014Previous studies from this\nlaboratory have identified similarities in signaling events\nbetween LPS-treated rats and aged rats, in particular signaling\nevents triggered by increased IL-1\u0001 concentration (1, 3, 4).\nHere we report that there were significant age-related increases\nin concentrations of IFN\u0002 and IL-1\u0001 and in MHCII mRNA\nexpression in hippocampal tissue prepared from aged, com-\npared with young rats (*, p\u0005 0.05; **, p\u0005 0.01, ANOVA, Fig. 7,\na\u2013c) and that treatment with atorvastatin blocked these age-\nrelated changes so that the values in tissue prepared from hip-\npocampus of aged atorvastatin-treated rats were significantly\ndecreased compared with those in tissue prepared from aged\nrats that did not receive atorvastatin (\u0006, p\u0005 0.05; \u0006\u0006, p\u0005 0.01,\nANOVA). Although atorvastatin completely reversed the\nIFN\u0002-induced increases in cytokine concentration, its effect on\nMHCII was partial, and, therefore, the mean value in tissue\nprepared from aged rats that received atorvastatin was signifi-\ncantly greater than in both groups of young rats (*, p \u0005 0.05,\nANOVA).\nThe data show that there was a significant age-related\ndecrease in IL-4 concentration (*, p \u0005 0.05, ANOVA, Fig. 7d)\nand that this was significantly attenuated by atorvastatin so that\nmeanhippocampal IL-4 concentrationwas significantly greater\nin tissue prepared from aged rats that received atorvastatin\ncomparedwith aged control rats (\u0006, p\u0005 0.05, ANOVA, Fig. 7d).\nImportantly the atorvastatin-induced changes were associated\nwith rescue of the age-related deficit in LTP; LTP was signifi-\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n- +                    - +    LPS\nControl                    Atorvastatin\n*\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100 *\n+\n- +                    - +    LPS\nControl                    Atorvastatin\na.\nb.\n0\n100\n200\n300\nIF\nN\n\u03b3\n(p\ng\/\nm\ng)\n*\n+\n- +       - +                  - +        - +   LPS\n- - +         +                  - - +        +   ATV\nWildtype IL-4-\/-\n0\n25\n50\n75\nIL\n-1\n\u03b2\n(p\ng\/\nm\ng)\n***\n++\n- +       - +                  - +        - +   LPS\n- - +         +                  - - +        +   ATV\nWildtype IL-4-\/-\nc.\nd.\nIF\nN\u03b3\n(p\ng\/\nm\ng)\nIF\nN\u03b3\n(p\ng\/\nm\ng)\nIF\nN\u03b3\n(p\ng\/\nm\ng)\nIL-\n4 (\npg\n\/m\ng)\nIL-\n4 (\npg\n\/m\ng)\nIL-\n4 (\npg\n\/m\ng)\nIF\nN\n\u03b3\n(p\ng\/\nm\ng)\nIF\nN\n\u03b3\n(p\ng\/\nm\ng)\nIL\n-1\n\u03b2\n(p\ng\/\nm\ng)\nFIGURE 4.

We report that\nmicroglial activation, IFN\u0002, and IL-1\u0001 were increased in hip-\npocampal tissue prepared from aged and LPS-treated rats and\nthat these changes were accompanied by inhibition of LTP.We\nhypothesize that the primary action of atorvastatin is to\nincrease IL-4 and that this prevents the IFN\u0002-induced micro-\nglial activation, which triggers the cascade of events. This\nhypothesis is supported by the find-\ning that atorvastatin fails to attenu-\nate the LPS-induced increases in\nIFN\u0002 and IL-1\u0001 in tissue prepared\nfrom IL-4\u0001\/\u0001mice.\nOur data describe an age-related,\nas well as an LPS-induced, increase\nin IL-1\u0001 concentration in the hip-\npocampus paralleled by increased\nmicroglial activation, which is con-\nsistent with the view that these cells\nare the likely source of IL-1\u0001 (6,\n25, 26). We considered that IFN\u0002\nmight trigger the activation of\nmicroglia in the hippocampus of\nLPS-treated and aged rats, because\nit a potent activator of microglia in\nvitro (24, 27). We found that hip-\npocampal concentration of IFN\u0002\nwas increased in parallel with the\nincrease in microglial activation in\nthe hippocampal tissue prepared\nfrom LPS-treated and aged rats,\nwhereas these changes were also\nobserved following intracerebrov-\nentricular injection of IFN\u0002. Recent\nevidence from studies in aged rats\nhas indicated that the impairment\nin LTP is associated, not only with\nincreased IL-1\u0001, butwith an array of\nchanges in pro-inflammatory and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines, (26,\n27); specifically, an inverse correla-\ntion between hippocampal concen-\ntrations of IL-1\u0001 and IL-4 has been\nidentified as being critical in deter-\nmining the ability of aged rats to\nsustain LTP (28). Significantly, we\nhave previously reported that\nincreasing hippocampal IL-4 con-\ncentration reverses the age-related\nandLPS-induceddeficits in LTP and that intracerebroventricu-\nlar injection of IL-4 partly attenuates the age-related deficit in\nLTP (6, 29).\nWe addressed the possible role of IL-4 here by asking\nwhether the atorvastatin-induced modulation of IL-1\u0001 was\ncoupled with a change in IL-4, and our data show that IL-4\nconcentrationwas indeed increased in atorvastatin-treated rats\nthat received LPS and that atorvastatin treatment was associ-\nated with a reversal of the age-related decrease in IL-4. We\ndemonstrate that IL-4 attenuates the IFN\u0002-triggered increases\nin MHCII expression and IL-1\u0001 concentration and, in parallel,\nantagonizes the IFN\u0002-induced inhibition of LTP. This antago-\nnistic effect of IL-4 on IFN\u0002-induced changes indicates that the\natorvastatin-induced increase in IL-4 inhibits the cascade of\nevents triggered by the age- and LPS-induced increase in the\nhippocampal concentration of IFN\u0002 and the subsequentmicro-\nglial activation.

Intraperitoneal injection of LPS increased both\nIFN\u0002 and IL-1\u0001 in brain tissue prepared from wild-type mice,\nand these effects were attenuated in the atorvastatin-treated\nmice. In contrast, atorvastatin exerted no effect on LPS-in-\nduced changes in tissue prepared from IL-4\u0001\/\u0001 mice, demon-\nstrating that the effect of atorvastatin is IL-4-dependent. Con-\nsistent with these data, Youssef and colleagues (15) suggested\nthat the beneficial effects of atorvastatin in attenuating the det-\nrimental changes associated with experimental autoimmune\nencephalomyelitis were achieved by up-regulating release of\nTh2-derived cytokines, which include IL-4, from splenocytes.\nAlthough the data presented here suggest that the atorvasta-\ntin-induced increase in IL-4 is the key factor in decreasing\nmicroglial activation, there is a lack of concordance in the liter-\nature regarding the effect of statins onmicroglial activation. On\nthe one hand certain statins have been reported to induce\ninflammation, for instance lovastatin has been shown to\nincrease IL-1\u0001 concentration in brain tissue of transgenic\nmice, which overexpress human amyloid precursor protein\n(30), and TNF\u0005 concentration in cultured hippocampal slices\n(13). Similarly, cerivastatin and fluvastatin have been reported\nto up-regulate IL-1\u0001- and IFN\u0002-induced changes in smooth\nmuscle (31, 32) and hepatoma cells (32). In contrast, simvasta-\ntin and lovastatin block the A\u0001-induced increase in IL-1\u0001 pro-\nduction inmonocytes and BV2 cells (33) and the IFN\u0002-induced\nincrease in release of TNF\u0005, IL-1\u0001 and IL-6 in cultured micro-\nglia (34). We have recently reported a beneficial effect of ator-\nvastatin treatment in vivo against A\u0001-induced increases in\nmicroglial activation and IL-1\u0001 concentration (35). This anti-\ninflammatory role is supported by a large body of evidence indi-\ncating that certain statins are protective in ischemia (36\u201339)\nand experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (see Ref. 40)\nin which the degenerative effects are attributed, at least in part,\nto inflammation and microglial activation.\nWe demonstrate that the effects of LPS and atorvastatin on\nmicroglial activation and IL-1\u0001 concentration were mirrored\nby changes in activation of JNK and c-Jun and in activation of\np38 and NF\u0004B. The importance of these signaling cascades in\nmodulating LTP has been highlighted by the demonstration\nthat the LPS-induced inhibition of LTP was blocked by inhibi-\ntors of JNK, p38, and NF\u0004B (3, 23). To our knowledge there are\nno data showing that statins can attenuate LPS-induced and\/or\nIL-1\u0001-mediated signaling cascades in brain in vivo and few data\ndocumenting a modulatory effect in vitro (41). In contrast, sev-\neral studies have revealed that statins block stimulus-induced\nactivation of JNK and\/or c-Jun in myocytes (42), Chinese ham-\nster ovary cells (43), and macrophages (44), whereas a similar\nantagonistic effect on stimulus-induced activation of p38 and\nNF\u0004B in monocytes (45), vascular endothelial cells (46), and\nmacrophages (47, 48) has been reported. A significant finding\nof this study is that atorvastatin treatment abrogates the inflam-\nmatory and signaling changes in rat hippocampus which we\nbelieve are mediated by increased IL-1\u0001 concentration. The\nevidence suggests that a key action relies on its ability to mod-\nulate the IFN\u0002-induced microglial activation in LPS-treated\nand in aged rats. One downstream consequence of this is that\natorvastatin restores LTP in both groups of rats. Results from\nepidemiological studies indicate a beneficial effect of statin\ntherapy on cognition (49\u201353), which is consistent with the\npresent data. However, it has also been suggested that statins\nmay exert a negative effect on cognitive function (54), although\na recent report indicated that atorvastatin (10 mg\/day) had no\nsuch effect (55). We have previously reported a small but sta-\ntistically significant atorvastatin-induced decrease in LTP in\nyoung rats following a 3-week treatment period (35), and the\ndata presented here concur with this, but treatment for 8 weeks\ndid not modulate LTP.\nOne of the key issues raised regarding the potential effects of\nstatins in the central nervous system relates to their ability to\ncross the blood-brain barrier (56). Some researchers have\nasserted that atorvastatin is lipophilic (57, 58), whereas others\nsuggest it is not (59).Wedetected small amounts of atorvastatin\n(\u000430 pg) in the brains of atorvastatin-treated animals (data not\nshown), which suggests that it can enter the brain, but whether\nthis is a result of blood-brain barrier breakdown following LPS\nchallenge, facilitated transport via atorvastatin transporters, or\nsimple diffusion remains to be determined. Whether a statin\nthat can cross the blood-brain barrier is advantageous or not is\na question that remains, and it must be concluded that the\neffect of statins is dependent on the specific statin, the tissue\nunder investigation, and the stimulus upon which the modula-\ntory effects are analyzed.\nImportantly, althoughwe observed an age-related increase in\ncholesterol concentration in brain tissue (though LPS exerted\nno effect), atorvastatin failed to modulate brain cholesterol\nconcentration. We conclude that the effects of atorvastatin\ndescribed here are unrelated to its well described cholesterol-\nlowering action. The data suggest that its beneficial effects\nderive from its ability tomaintainmicroglia in a quiescent state,\nand in particular, from its ability to increase IL-4.\nREFERENCES\n1. Martin, D.
