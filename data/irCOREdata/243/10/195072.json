This paper considers the work-related identities middle leaders construct \u2013what they think \nit means to be a middle leader - within the social and policy contexts of their secondary schools. \nThe complexity of their work becomes clear and the centrality to their work of negotiation and \ninfluence \u2013 the micro-political processes of organisations - becomes stark. At the core of their \nactions lie values that guide how they interact with colleagues, students and senior management \nstaff when trying to shape and implement departmental and school policies  \n \n \n \n \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  4 \nBeing a middle leader: exploring professional identities  \n \n \n \n \nDeveloping professional selves in institutional contexts \n \nThe pursuit and enactment of self-identity by people is a central aspect of their development of \nagency (Giddens, 1991). Greenfield (1993) perceives this process being made up of acts of \nindividual will and practice, an existential view according to Ryan (2003). Giddens (1984) \nconstrues it as part of an interactive process in which people engage with other people to construct \nsocial systems and structures. The notion of identity derives from where and how people locate \nthemselves within a society or a community (LaFontaine, 1985; Bourdieu, 1990), as well as from \nthe Greek notion of persona or mask that allows people to play particular ascribe parts in a \ncommunity, whether on not it is a fictional one on a stage (Hollis, 1985). So the notion of \ndeveloping personhood (Aubrey et al , 2000) is complex, made up of individual and social elements \nand, in the contexts of institutionalised work, of elements that are related to a person\u2019 work-related \nlife and elements that are not. The latter are often not visible to work-based colleagues. \n \nPeople develop their work-related (professional) self-identities through their interactions with other \npeople in a variety of milieu through time. These identities are grounded in people\u2019s individual \nhistories, personalities and work-related experiences (Nias, 1999; Goodson, 1992; Thomas, 1995a), \nincluding, for staff in schools, their experiences as students in various institutions (e.g. Gersten, \n1995). Students and staff use these dialogic and reflective ways to develop core educational and \nsocial values to guide their actions consciously and unconsciously. (Hodgkinson, 1991; Begley, \n1999). In doing this, as Smyth et al (2000) point out, teachers (and they could have included \nstudents and support staff, too) \u2018have to contend with the power relationships that operate in schools \nand educational systems\u2019 (p.149), as well as with contextual factors of race, gender, creed and \nsocio-economic status (SES) (Smyth et al, 2000).  \n \nTo people workers, such as teachers and leaders at any level in schools, understanding people\u2019s \nactions in terms of how they are constructing their self identities in particular contexts is essential to \nbeing able to work with them successfully. However this is not a value-free process. The bully and \nthe autocrat as well as the marketing manager and the diplomat, to be successful in their practices, \nhave to have sound understandings of other people. Some use this to exert power over people, to \ncoerce them (Etzioni, 1961), others use it to manipulate or manage them. Blase and Anderson \n(1995) suggest leaders in schools use power in a variety of ways to shape the work of colleagues \nand students. The sources of power on which people can draw are multifaceted and only partially \nrelated to the authority that is associated with the formal posts they hold (French and Raven, 1968; \nBusher, 2001). One of these is knowledge about persons. The choices that individual leaders make \nabout how to use their knowledge of students\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 developing work-related selves \ninvolve value-laden or moral decisions about how to act to create more or less harm and in whose \ninterests. Teachers are sharply aware of this when working with students. Middle leaders, too, on \nsome of whom this paper focuses, also have to be conscious of this when working with teachers and \nother staff as well as with students. Middle leaders encompass a wide range of people in schools \nsuch as subject leaders, heads of department, pastoral leaders (e.g. heads of year), SENCOs \n(Bennett. et al, 2003). Busher and Saran (1995) stretched the list to include some members of the \nsupport staff, such as site supervisors, too.  \n \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  5 \nIn the view developed here, persons, not systems, are perceived as the centres of knowing and the \nconstructors of meaning (Harrison, 1994:177) in and of institutions. So schools as communities are \nconstructed through dialogical processes between individuals and between individuals and \ncollectivities, such as departments or groups of students or external stakeholders. The outcomes \nfrom these evolving discussions are shaped more by the differential access to power which \nparticipants can gain to assert their preferred definitions of situations than by the coherence of an \nargument or the rationality of a suggested approach to resolving problems that may be put forward \nby participants in the dialogue.  Outcomes also depend on policy imperatives imported into schools \nfrom the macro socio-political contexts outside them. It leads Ribbins (1999) to argue that all \ndecision-making in schools involves political acts that encompass value-laden choices between \ndifferent possible actions. For example, allocating resources to some people and projects rather than \nto others, since only some can be afforded, involves moral as well as financial and personnel \njudgements about which people should receive and who should be deprived. \n \nSchools in this paper are construed as sites of policy processes (Grace, 1995; Bowe and Ball, 1992) \nthat are sustained by asymmetrical and negotiable relationships of power between school members. \nIn these institutions organisational structures are no more, though no less, than the historical \noutcomes of negotiative processes, the reflections of past and present hierarchical relationships \nwithin the school that are sustained and eroded by changing socio-political contexts. The external \ncontexts relevant to a study in England, UK, include central and local government policies as well \nas shifts in public attitudes and the socio-economic status of members of the communities which \neach school serves (Riley et al. 2000; Busher and Barker, 2003). At national government level are \nto be found policies such as the National Curriculum, OFSTED inspections, Key Stage Three \nstrategies and the introduction of performance management into schools, as well as curriculum \nframeworks policed by public examination boards on behalf of central government. At local or \nregional government level are policies defining from which communities a schools\u2019 students come, \nwhat levels of support particular students might receive, and how schools can most successfully \nimprove the quality of learning and teaching. The internal policy contexts are constructed and \nprojected by a school\u2019s senior management team (Grace, 1995). Like leaders at all levels in a school \nmiddle leaders mediate the values and demands from these contexts to their colleagues, students \nand their students\u2019 parents and carers, as well as taking account of their colleagues\u2019, students\u2019 and \nstudents\u2019 parents\u2019 values and beliefs.  \n \nThe construction of school policies, teaching and learning practices, and school cultures and sub-\ncultures, is a moral and a political activity involving the managing, monitoring and resolving of \nvalue conflicts, where values are defined as concepts of the desirable (Hodgkinson, 1999:7). \nAlthough this work is carried out by all participants in a school some, especially formally \ndesignated leaders at all levels, have more access to power to influence the shaping of these \nprocesses. Construction involves leaders confronting moral dilemmas about the distribution of \npeople, resources and power. Resolving these ethically and transparently in keeping with previously \nestablished social and moral norms of the school community seems to be central to successful \nleadership in English schools. MacBeath and MacDonald (2000) suggest that decision-making \nbased on the use of moral authority grounded in shared professional and social values is most likely \nto promote the social cohesion and collegiality that can lead to improved practice.   \n \nSuch approaches to decision making are more likely to be sustained by the values embedded in \ndistributed leadership (Gronn, 2000; Woods et al, 2003) than by leadership styles that are more \nautocratic or corporate in focus. Distributed leadership embodies particular approaches to working \nwith and using power with other people (Blase and Anderson, 1995). This includes fostering \npositive interpersonal relationships based on shared values between people to construct a sense of \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  6 \ncommunity  (Sergiovanni, 2001), and allowing leadership for particular aspects of joint activity to \nbe shared amongst members of the group or community (Gronn, 2002). This cannot, however, \noverlook the force of personality which some people project whatever their formal post in an \ninstitution, and has led Allix (2000) to question the extent to which transformational leadership in \nthe hands of such a person may be as coercive as other non-consultative approaches to leadership. \nIn communities where there is trust between members Smyth et al, (2000) argue that participants \nare likely to sustain a critical dialogue between themselves, whatever position they hold, about the \npractices of teaching and learning and the development of those to better meet the needs of all \nstudent. Hopkins (2001) perceive trust as crucial to creating cultures in schools and departments \nthat can facilitate the implementation of organisational change and the improvement of teaching and \nlearning practices. Gunter et al (2001) translate this into teachers\u2019 practices in the classroom, \ndiscussing how teachers as leaders of learning in the classroom \u2013 meaning any site where formal \nlearning is intended to take place \u2013 work successfully with students to construct learning processes \nthat are meaningful and relevant to all of them. \n \nThe same approaches to leadership that are likely to improve the quality of teaching and learning \nare likely to foster staff professional development, leading to the emergence of what have been \ncalled professional learning communities (Senge, 1990; Bottery, 2003). Empowering other people \ncreatively to develop themselves and their performance of practice requires leaders to foster \nparticular organisational cultures that have been described as collegial (Hargreaves, 1994) and that \nincorporate collaborative styles of working (MacGregor, 2000). Murphy (1992) suggests that \nleaders who veer towards being creative and empowering might be \u2018servant leaders\u2019 or educative \nleaders (Duignan and McPherson, 1992) who try to promote the interdependence and professional \ndevelopment of colleagues (Ribbins, 1992) within the constraints of the internal organisational and \nextra-organisational policies and structures that currently exist. However, given that some people in \nschool have greater access to power and authority than others, it is doubtful to what extent genuine \ncollegiality or democracy can be achieved in hierarchical organisations such as schools \n \n \nResearch design and methods  \n \nThis study focuses on the work of six middle leaders (three men and three women) in departments \nin four secondary schools in the Midlands of England, UK, in 2001\/02, following the work of \nMeasor and Sikes (1992). Siskin (1994) points out that subject areas are critical sites for developing \nteachers\u2019 practices. As the study included subject and pastoral leaders, the term middle leader is \npreferred except where indicating a person\u2019s particular status. The study used an interpretative \napproach to explore how people constructed and construed meanings in their social situations, \nfollowing Ribbins (1997) view that is only by listening to people\u2019s voices that one really finds out \nwhat it is like to be and to work in an institution like a school. This study merely sets out to record \nand analyse what appeared to be happening in the departments in the schools in this study, not to \npredict or propose what practices and enacted values might lead to particular outcomes. \n \nParticipants were selected opportunistically from among schools and departments that regularly \nhave PGCE students on placement with them. They came from a variety of different sized \ndepartments, following the views of Busher and Harris (1999), and included two pastoral \ndepartments (Sixth Forms); a history department; a humanities faculty (including history, \ngeography and RE departments); and an English department. I interviewed them on one occasion \nand then work-shadowed them for one day mid-week, observing them teach and work with their \ndepartmental colleagues and with students in lessons, interviewing them again at the end of the day. \nI also interviewed some of their departmental colleagues (10 in all:  four men and six women) and \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  7 \none member of senior staff each (four men and one woman) about their work, finding these \nparticipants by using snowball sampling. Most of these collateral interviews took place during the \ndays I was in school visiting the middle leaders. Although the snowball sampling minimised ethical \nproblems of talking with people about others without permission, and was an expeditious means of \nfinding such participants, it left the middle leaders with power to shape the view I might have of \nthem through their selection \/ non-selection of participants. The triangulation of middle leaders\u2019 \nviews of their work with that of staff colleagues was intended to strengthen the authenticity of the \nstudy by addressing doubts about the trustworthiness of single authored texts (Thomas, 1995b). It \nallowed me to check their espoused theories of practice against their enacted theories (Schon, \n1987). All the interviews were semi-structured, as were the observations. The interviews were tape-\nrecorded and transcribed. The observations were recorded by hand in real time. In addition relevant \ndocuments about each school and department were collected. In this paper mainly middle leaders\u2019 \nvoices are heard although observation of teachers and students\u2019 interactions with the middle leaders \nunderpin the discussion and cast interesting lights on the leaders\u2019 proclaimed values and views on \nteaching and learning. \n \n \nExploring the identities that middle leaders construct  \n \nBiographies and values \n \nMiddle leaders biographies made a deep impact on their professional identities (Busher, 2002). \nMany made reference to their childhood and how this had affected their views and values on \nteaching, learning and leading.  One referred to her father\u2019s love of knowledge and the location of \nthe family home. The latter encouraged in her interest in outdoor activities. Another, female subject \nleader, commented how her parents were always interested in how well she was doing at school, \namongst other things checking what homework was set and whether or not she had done it. \n \nThe values that the middle leaders carried with them into teaching, were derived from a variety of \nsources. Some came from their family backgrounds. Others came from teachers with whom they \nhad worked as students when at school themselves or in higher education and from teachers with \nwhom they had worked early in their careers. The values to which they laid claim covered a range \nof aspects of their work: working with students; the importance of their subject area; teaching; \nworking cultures in their subject area; and the allocation of resources to students (Busher, 2003).  \n \nIn particular, their reflections on their experiences at school and university had shaped their views \nof successful teaching. Several of them chose to develop their own practice for teaching and \nmanaging out of the creative and caring examples modelled by their teachers who had mediated the \neducational contexts they had experienced during their struggles as students. \n \n \nWhy they chose to become a middle leaders \n \nSeveral participants identified skills they possessed that they thought suited them for leadership, \nincluding those of being effective organisers outside the classroom. Others celebrated the creativity \nof being a middle leader \n \nmaking up schemes [of work] \u2026 Having the chance to have a budget, plan it, implement it \nand see it actually happening in front of your eyes [male subject leader] \n \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  8 \nOthers commented on the broader perspectives on education holding a middle leader post gave \nthem, or had given them, as well as the opportunities it offered to understand their work in wider \npolicy contexts and to interact more with those contexts. \n \nSome of them perceived promotion to middle leadership as an opportunity to assert their voice and \ntheir ideas more strongly within their school. Some claimed this had not been apparent to them in \ntheir first years of teaching, but other, usually more experienced teacher had helped them to realise \nthe possibilities. Promotion shaped their sense of their work-related identity, their views of \nthemselves being bound up with the formal positions they held in the school hierarchy. \n \n \nBeing a middle leader \n \nThe middle leaders in this study thought there were six key functional aspects to their work \u2013 see \nTable One \u2013 and held remarkably homogeneous views on their preferred departmental cultures. \nThis surprising homogeneity in a study that was sited in well-scattered schools within a region may \nbe due to the way in which the middle leaders were sampled. These views were largely supported \nby the other teachers and senior staff in the study and by observations of the middle leaders working \nwith students and colleagues.  \n \n \nTable One Key functional aspects of middle leaders\u2019 work (about here) \n \n \n1) Developing and projecting a vision \n \nMiddle leaders considered it important to have a clear vision, encapsulating certain educational and \nsocial values, for the development of their departments, and to project this to their colleagues. They \nthought they should have a view of how their department was going to improve the curriculum, \nalthough they then tried to work with colleagues to achieve this. \n \nIn subject departments the values were related to the subject area and to its diverse pedagogic \npractices. For example, one middle leaders wanted to  \n \nmake my subject accessible to all students [using] a variety of teaching styles that apply to \ndifferent learners. Some get a real kick out of writing reams \u2026 [some] are more into hands \non learning, like games \u2026 discussion work, card activities \u2026 Yet \u2026 they are still learning \nabout the past \u2026 still developing key historical skills [female subject leader] \n \nIn pastoral departments the vision focused on values concerned with student personal growth and \ndevelopment based on a watchful trustfulness by teachers of students\u2019 efforts to learn. \n \nOther values middle leaders wanted to project related to \u2018professional\u2019 practice by colleagues. One \nexpected his colleagues  \n \nto treat the RE lessons with vigour and seriousness \u2026 to be professional and as efficient as \npossible, within limits of time \u2026 I expect them to follow the schemes of work, which has \nnot always happened, and I expect them to do the assessments. I expect them to file the \nresources!  [male subject leader] \n \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  9 \nThese values were linked to social ones about how colleagues should interact with each other. This \nmiddle leader thought that good interpersonal relationships between staff made it easier for them to \nwork as a departmental team.  \n \n \n2) The will to use power \n \nTo create and implement policy successfully in their departments, middle leaders claimed that they \nhad to have the energy to want to do so \u2013 a notion of will power. They wanted to implement their \nown vision of a successful department. This they thought could be most successfully achieved by \nworking with and through colleagues to ensure that policies were successfully carried out. In one \nfaculty subject leaders met weekly formally but also held a lot of informal conversations to clarify: \n \nour priorities for the department. Then we will feed that down to the department [staff] to \u2026 \ntake on board their ideas \u2026 we may have to listen to the department and [change the] way \nwe will do it \u2026 it could be about workload, which is a real issue \u2026 The bottom line is I am \nthe head of faculty and this is how we are going to do it, like it or not [female subject leader] \n \nThe emphasis here seems to have been on tough but open consultation with colleagues about \ndecisions. In other cases it was having the energy to persuade colleagues to uphold previously \nagreed departmental practices such as putting resources away in designated locations or completing \nstudent assessments on time. Yet others perceived this projection of power as taking the form of \ncreating a strategic framework for action by departmental colleagues and then checking up that \ntargets had been met, as well as providing support to colleagues to help them meet these.  \n \nThe asymmetrical power relationships in departments were most visible when middle leaders were \nco-ordinating and monitoring the progress of work. Through monitoring student performance, \nmiddle leaders were able to exercise surveillance of staff performance, as middle leaders and staff \nacknowledged: \n \nMaking sure that everybody has \u2026 information on the computer. Reports sorted out. People \nhave done what they should be doing, like assessments at the right time; books marked; \nmeeting requirements for teaching [female subject leader] \n \nHowever teachers in the departments seemed to accept this surveillance as a legitimate part of the \nmiddle leaders\u2019 work in its current socio-political contexts so it did not appear to threaten the \ncollaborative cultures of the departments. This acceptance seems to have been facilitated by the \nconsultative manner in which these processes were constructed and implemented by middle leaders. \n \n \n3) Working with staff \u2013 the core of middle leadership \n \nNegotiating and interacting with colleagues lay at the core of middle leaders\u2019 work with staff. Some \nperceived it as quite challenging. According to one female subject leader the hardest part of her job \nwas to persuade her colleagues to follow the same policy and practice, particularly as the \ndepartment was made up of \u2018quite diverse people\u2019, and impossible to get them all moving at the \nsame speed towards agreed educational goals. Middle leaders countered this tendency to dispersion \nof practice by colleagues by using their access to various sources of power. This was most visible \nwhen they acted as agents for a school\u2019s senior staff to ensure teachers in their departments were \n \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  10 \nproducing \u2026 everything connected with their subject \u2026 in the classroom, and the \npaperwork, and what the [school] hierarchy needs, and what the LEA or government \nrequires  [male subject leader] \n \nThis structuring of practice and performance included planning curriculum targets in keeping with  \npublic examination bodies and the National curriculum at the appropriate Key Stage for the \nstudents, and monitoring progress on meeting these targets to ensure that teachers and students did \nnot become the focus of criticism by the school\u2019s senior management. Middle leaders\u2019 colleagues \nwelcomed the planning of work for the department to create targets for the students and staff as it \ngave them an administrative framework within which they could focus on working with their \nstudents. \n \nIf control and constraint was one element to middle leaders practice, support and facilitation of the \nwork of colleagues and students was another equally important one. They supported staff in various \nways, including setting work for supply teachers and disciplining students who disturbed other \nteachers\u2019 lessons: \n \nbecause I am the [teachers\u2019] line manager \u2026 and knowing staff as I do, I know which kids I \nneed to sort out [female subject leader] \n \nObservations indicated that middle leaders spent a considerable amount of their non-contact time \ndealing with students who flouted school rules and contacting and relating to parents because of \nthis. \n \nTo help colleagues meet curriculum targets middle leaders tried to manage their departments \neffectively \u2013 as is discussed below -, acted as advocates for their colleagues\u2019 views to the senior \nmanagement team, and worked with colleagues to resolve problems that threatened t the \nachievement of the targets, as their colleagues acknowledged. \n \nThese instrumental activities were supported by the middle leaders\u2019 interpersonal relationships with \ntheir colleague teachers and support staff.  The values they expressed through these helped to \nconstruct collaborative departmental cultures, which the middle leaders and their colleagues said \nthey preferred. Both commented how people in their departments liked working together and \nsharing some social time together, in some cases out of school hours. \n \n \n4) Co-ordinating departments effectively \n \nTo carry forward the enterprise of improving teaching and learning for all students, middle leaders \nthought they had to manage their departments effectively. To do this they carried out a considerable \nrange of administrative tasks:  \n \nfiling and buying the books. \u2026 the exam entries, the mocks [exams] \u2026 I have created a \nshelf of specialist RE books for people taking religious assemblies \u2026 I find myself flying \nthe flag for RE [male subject leader] \n \nand created centralised management systems: \n \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  11 \ncentral resources and common schemes of work, common assessment, common [student] \nrecords that we put on to Excel that can be monitored to see how different classes are doing \nand that staff are meeting deadlines [female subject leader] \n \nAlthough this restricted the autonomy of teachers, many accepted it as a necessary and normal part \nof working in a school department and some welcomed the clear administrative framework as a \nsupport to shape their decision-making.  \n \nI have got a folder of all the assessments at the front and the scheme of work and all the \nvarious work sheets for different abilities [of students] \u2026[Subject leader] also looks for \ntextbooks. All the textbooks are in a box \u2026 and on the wall there is a sheet where we can \nbook the textbooks out [female teacher] \n \nThe centralised management systems were intended to ensure appropriate resources were allocated \nequitably. As well as physical resources middle leaders provided intellectual resources including \nspecialist knowledge on the subject and its pedagogy, as several teachers acknowledged, by  \n \ntrying to share ideas, mainly through schemes of work, putting teaching methods down, for \nexample [female subject leader] \n \nThe allocation of resources was a value-laden process, not just a technical one, as several middle \nleaders acknowledged: \n \n Value for money  \u2026 I would hope in every school, that we \u2026 spend the money fairly and \nequally across all the pupils [male subject leader] \n \nHowever such communitarian values were in conflict with the market-oriented policies of central \ngovernment \n \n \n5) Mediating contexts: engaging in arenas \n \nMiddle leaders in this study engaged in an endless round of negotiation with people in various \narenas. These ranged from classroom arenas (any site where formal learning was intended to take \nplace), usually with students; to departmental arenas, usually with teacher colleagues, which has \nalready been discussed; to school organisation policy arenas that involved a wide range of staff such \nas support staff, other middle leaders, senior staff and school governors; to local or civic social and \npolicy arenas; and to national policy arenas, often concerning syllabus changes and the entry of \nstudents to examinations.  \n \nIn the school organisation policy arena middle leaders had multi-faceted and ambiguous \nrelationships with senior management. At times they acted as agents for the senior staff:  \n \nwho feeds to the department the aims of the school, where the school is going, and how we \ncan bring those aims down through into the department and in to a classroom level [female \nsubject leader] \n \nIn part this was because they were dependent on senior staff for the successful implementation of \npreferred departmental policies  \n \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  12 \nfor instance, we are able to bid for money through a capital bid and I have always been very \nwell supported by SMT in the budget [female subject leader] \n \nand for developing a strategic vision and plan for their departments. One middle leader had \ndifficulty \n \norganising mock exams for RE, which is only a GCSE short course, for one year, but it is \ncompulsory for all students \u2026 and they [Senior staff] would not timetable them at the same \ntime as the other mocks but expected them to be done in lesson time [male subject leader] \n \nHowever they also acted as advocates for their colleagues with senior staff, representing their views \non school policy and defending them against senior management prejudices and policies.  \n \nMiddle leaders negotiated with colleagues in other departments, formally through school middle \nleaders meetings, when trying to implement departmental policy such as the undertaking of \nfieldwork with a group of students. \n \nFrom the civic and national arenas middle leaders mediated the impact of different policies on their \nand their colleagues\u2019 work with students, for example, by modifying aspects of the curriculum to \nreflect local sensibilities and perspectives. However several said that the flood of new government \ninitiatives during the 1990s had taxed their resourcefulness \n \nthe amazing amount of new initiatives \u2026 The amount of paper work, the amount of admin. \ninvolved \u2026 has changed beyond all recognition. \u2026 we [now] have less time to spend with \npupils, and more of our time is being spent on what we would call bureaucracy [male \nsubject leader] \n \nApart from the National Curriculum middle leaders referred to government literacy, numeracy and \nKey Stage Three strategies, the impact of OFSTED inspections, and the impact which performance \nmanagement was having on their relationships with colleagues.   \n \nAnd after the last OFSTED I am going to have to monitor their marking and observe, which \nshould be an interesting challenge [female subject leader] \n \nIn some cases OFSTED inspections had enhanced the influence of middle leaders in the school \nbecause inspectors\u2019 reports had praised the work of their departments. \n \n \n6) Being a teacher \n \nSeveral middle leaders considered that being a good teacher was essential for being respected and \nregarded as effective by his or her colleagues.  \n \nNot the most innovative but the most effective. If you can show that to colleagues through \nthe response of the students that you teach [male subject leader] \n \nObservational data showed that middle leaders used a variety of teaching strategies to encourage \nstudents to engage with learning through differentiating the curriculum to suit their particular \nlearning needs. Students appeared to spend most of their time on task in well-organised lessons that \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  13 \nhad clearly defined objectives, sometimes put on a board at the start of a lesson, and suitable \nresources for the intended variety of activities.  \n \nMiddle leaders debated the impact of holding office on the quality of their teaching. Some thought \nit improved their work because they were more aware of the broader educational and social \ncontexts. Others thought that it made them less effective teachers for those students who needed \nmore detailed preparation of their work. They no longer had time available for this, spending their \ncreative energy on managing their departments. Observed middle leaders were frequently late for \ntheir lessons as a result of trying to meet other teachers\u2019 needs although this did not appear to affect \ntheir control of their classes. They often had to undertake administrative tasks during lessons, when \npupils were getting on with their own work, in order to meet deadlines imposed by senior staff or \noutside sources. They spent a lot of their non-contact time visiting colleagues, senior colleagues and \nadministrative offices, and pursuing troublesome students on their own or colleagues\u2019 behalf \nsometimes to arrange detentions or contact parents. \n \n \nReflections \n \nWhat emerges from this small scale study of middle leaders in some secondary schools is the \nimportance to their professional identities of the educational and social values they developed \nthrough their historical biographies and their professional experiences. In doing this they located \nthemselves in their educational communities and donned the mantles of their respective ascribe \nroles to play their part in the theatre of school politics. Not surprisingly, then, the subject leaders \nemphasised the importance of their subject to the centrality of their work and those of their \ncolleagues, while the pastoral leaders emphasised the importance of students\u2019 social and personal \ndevelopment. All the middle leaders felt obliged to act as advocates for their departmental \ncolleagues and policies to the senior management team in their schools while also acting as agents \nfor senior management in representing school policies to their departmental colleagues. This janus-\nfaced performance by middle leaders has been noted elsewhere by Gunter (2001).  \n \nCentral to middle leaders\u2019 professional identities was continuing to be experienced and effective \nclassroom practitioners who could give advice and guidance to their colleagues and to students on \nthis basis. Some of the younger subject leaders were criticised by a few of their older colleagues for \nlacking this experience, even when their colleagues acknowledged they were successful teachers. \nMiddle leaders did not locate themselves as part of the management echelon of the school, \nidentifying themselves instead with the teachers. This identification emerged most clearly in the \nlanguage they did not use. They did not refer to themselves as managers. Indeed when they and \ntheir departmental colleagues talked about managers they referred almost exclusively to \u2018senior \nmanagers\u2019, meaning vice principals and principals in their schools. Middle leaders located \nthemselves and their work as part of that carried out by the professional workers or cadres of the \nschool \u2013 and their colleagues in their departments seemed willing to support this view. They \nperceived middle leaders as one of themselves, not part of the management hierarchy, although \nmiddle leaders visibly occupied promoted posts, in some cases of some seniority in their schools. \nThis construction of professional identity raises some interesting questions about the extent to \nwhich middle leaders can or should be considered teacher leaders, as is discussed below.  \n \nIn this context it is not surprising that middle leaders preferred to facilitate collaborative cultures \nwithin their departments (MacGregor, 2000). The cultures could not really be described as collegial \nsince the asymmetrical power relationships in the departments were clearly visible and often \nacknowledged, even in small matters such as who chaired meetings. None the less the cultures \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  14 \nseemed to have shared norms and values that were student centred, promoted equitable support to \nstudents, focused on improving the quality of teaching and learning to meet inclusively the needs of \nstudents, and fostered staff development. These cultures showed social cohesion amongst staff not \nonly in their professional work but also, to some extent, in their social contacts outside work, \nindicating the development of a sense of professional community in these departments certainly \namongst some of their members. \n \nPart of the development of that shared culture seemed to be the emergence of distributed leadership \n(Gronn, 2002), with various teachers in each department taking responsibility for different aspects \nof the department\u2019s operations as well as engaging in discussions about departmental policy through \nformal and informal consultations. None the less the distribution of leadership remained influenced \nby the asymmetrical power relationships that existed in the departments, and was openly \nacknowledge, that invested formally designated middle leaders with access to a wider range of \nsources of power than many of their colleagues. Middle leaders and their colleagues perceived their \nstyle of leadership as one that was consultative and transformational, promoting the core values \ndiscussed earlier. In part this was enacted by trying to help colleagues to enhance their capacities as \nmembers of the department through attending courses and in part by sharing in the leadership of the \ndepartment. Middle leaders perceived themselves as \u2018primus inter pares\u2019, although none of them \nused that term, a form of leadership that Gronn (2002) identifies as indicative of the institutionalised \npractices of distributed leadership. \n \nYet the departments were not cosy clubs but arenas of policy-making and negotiation which \npurposefully focused on implementing certain educational and social values to enhance the quality \nof teaching and learning for all students, a characteristic of learning communities noted by Bottery \n(2003). Further there were potent and accepted inequalities of power between middle leaders and \ntheir colleagues. These emerged most clearly when the former exercised managership\u2019 (Gronn, \n2003) to create an organisational framework for the effective running of their departments against \nwhich they monitored its performance and the performance of their colleagues. This was the \nenactment of middle leaders\u2019 passions to create effective departments that reflected their values and \ntheir positive and negative experiences of departments and teachers earlier in their careers and when \nstudents themselves. This tends to substantiates Greenfield\u2019s (1993) existential notion of leaders \nhaving to have the will to power if they are to be successful, but it does place limits on the extent to \nwhich the leadership of these departments can be considered distributed and the extent to which \ntheir cultures can be considered genuinely collegial (Hargreaves, 1994), although they certainly \nwere collaborative and at least professionally cohesive. \n \nThat such naked use of power over people (Blase and Anderson, 1995) did not appear to wreck the \ncollaborative cultures that operated in the departments may have been due to the legitimacy that \nteacher colleagues accorded the middle leaders\u2019 actions. There was a form of consent to their \nactions that was frequently renewed through middle leaders\u2019 formal and informal interactions with \ntheir colleagues in the specific policy contexts of the school. This consent was based on several \nstrands, firstly on that of consultation itself. Secondly it acknowledged that such actions fitted with \ncurrent socio-political and educational policies in the macro-sphere: middle leaders and teachers \nwere demonstrably keenly aware of these. Thirdly it accepted the sense of moral mission that \nmiddle leaders claimed to improve the quality of teaching and learning for all students and to create \neffective departments.  \n \nThe location of middle leaders in the internal policy processes of schools is important for an \neffective organisational analysis of schools. So it is important, finally, to consider whether they can \nor should be considered teacher leaders. Muijs and Harris (2003) think that teacher leaders can \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  15 \ninclude middle leaders so long as those middle leaders continue to have a major part of their work \nbased in the classroom and seek to work collectively with their teacher colleagues. In this study all \nthe middle leaders spent at least two thirds of their time teaching. Several, indeed complained that \nthey did not have sufficient time to carry out the supervisory work with colleagues that they needed \nto. On the other hand, Katzenmeyer and Moller (2001), admittedly writing in an American context \nwhere middle leaders are often no longer classroom practitioners, thought middle leaders could not \nbe considered teacher leaders, although they conceded that where middle leaders did spend a \nsubstantial mount of their time in the classroom they might be described as teacher leaders. Only \nFrost and Durant (2003) firmly confine the notion of teacher leadership to people holding non-\npromoted posts in schools but who take a lead in decision-making in a school beyond the doors of \ntheir classrooms. They argue this is presenting an alternative understanding to hierarchically based \nconceptions of leadership, disregarding the impossibility of having institutions without \nasymmetrical power relationships, and therefore hierarchies. On balance then it might be reasonable \nto consider the middle leaders in this study as teacher leaders. \n \nHowever, a different question is whether it is useful to consider middle leaders as teacher leaders \nwhen analysing the dynamics of educational organisations. To do so obscures the important \ndifferences there might be between leadership offered by post holders individually, with their access \nto various sources of power including those that arise through the offices they hold (Busher, 2001); \nleadership offered conjointly by formally designated leaders with their colleagues (Gronn, 2002; \nWoods et al, 2003); and those people in non-promoted posts, be they teachers, support staff or \nstudents, who offer leadership in a variety of ways to the whole school or to a department of it. \nFrom this perspective of analytical clarity it is probably more satisfactory not to refer to middle \nleaders as teacher leaders. None the less the centrality to their professional identities of being \nclassroom teachers and not managers has to be acknowledge if scholars are to better understand the \ndynamics of school decision-making and the implementation of policies for the improvement of \nteaching and learning for all. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBeing a middle leader \/  July 2003  16 \n \nReferences \n \nAubrey, C.
