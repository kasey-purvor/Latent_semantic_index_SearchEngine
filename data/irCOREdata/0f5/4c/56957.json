Rules are a tangible\nmeans of assessing the flexibility or inflexibility of the ward\nsocial system because the way in which they are applied\nand the relative importance attached to them, indicates the\nresponsiveness of nursing regimes towards patients\u2019 needs.\nRigidity may reflect the intractability of ward systems and\nthe  inability to provide individualized nursing care in the\nform of one-to-one contact with patients (Pilgrim & Rog-\ners 1994).\nSince the inception of the hospital closure programme\nand the advent of care in the community, huge changes\nhave occurred within psychiatry. Firstly, the function of\nacute admission wards has altered radically. Bed shortages\nand emphasis on acuity have put pressure on nurses to con-\ntain and intensively treat psychotic patients (Taylor & Tay-\nlor 1989, Thomas 1996). Consequently, ward rules may be\nimplemented rigidly because patients are expected to com-\nply rapidly with the treatment regimen so that they can be\ndischarged.\nThe Department of Health (DOH 2001) recommended\nthat a code of conduct for inpatients should incorporate\nbehavioural expectations. The code should also contain\nguidance on ward rules, which should be negotiated with\nservice users, and they should be given written information\nupon reception to the wards. The DOH also identified a\nneed for regular forums that encourage service-user\ninvolvement in deciding how the ward is organized, and\nrecommended that they address appropriate rules for\npatient conduct.\n \nSearch methods\n \nA search of CINAHL and PSYCHLIT electronic databases\nyielded 660 nursing articles related to ward rules and struc-\nture, 198 of which were selected and reviewed. The search\nterms used were: rule, ward, regime, atmosphere, routine,\nmanagement, structure, boundaries, limit setting, disobedi-\nent, discipline, authority, conform, compliance, non-\ncompliance, non-cooperative, resist, norm, regulate, order,\ncontrol, restrict, conduct. Not all were relevant, but those\nthat were appropriate were analyzed in chronological order\nof publication. This mode of analysis was chosen because it\n J. Alexander & L. Bowers \n \n624 \u00a9 \n \n2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing \n \n11\n \n, 623\u2013631\n \ntracked institutional changes within psychiatry, which\nmight be reflected at ward level in nurses\u2019 attitudes towards\ncontrol.\n \nThe literature\n \n1967\n \nA comparative study by Jungman & Bucher (1967) evalu-\nated the influence of ward milieu on patient behaviour.\nThey concluded that differing ward management systems\nin terms of rule clarity, structure and defined staff roles\naccounted for variations in the frequency of rule breaking\nbetween the two wards in the study. However, one of the\nwards contained a group of long-stay chronic patients, and\nthis might have confounded the results. Arguably, the par-\nticular clinical management problems with this patient\ngroup rather than the ward social system alone could\naccount for differences in outcomes.\n \n1971\n \nIn a descriptive study, Jurgensen (1971) advocated consis-\ntent limit setting in the management of hospitalized ado-\nlescent patients, and perceived that this approach should\nnot be confined to the management of disruptive or anti-\nsocial behaviour, rather it should form an intrinsic part of\nthe patient\u2019s care plan, and not be confined to the enforce-\nment of hospital rules.\n \n1976\n \nSimilarly, Bursten & Geach (1976) analyzed whether the\nstep system was justified on therapeutic grounds. This sys-\ntem curtails patients\u2019 autonomy in order to control their\nbehaviour, and aims to resocialize them by using a graded\nseries of privileges or activities. Rule breaking and the step\nsystem are interlinked; for example, patients who leave the\nward without permission may be grounded, so that they\nlearn to ask permission in the future. Only one of the study\nwards operated a formal step system, but no differences in\npatient outcomes were found, and the authors questioned\nwhether the use of the formal step system was therapeuti-\ncally justified. The study was limited because it used a ret-\nrospective method to evaluate therapeutic outcomes, but the\nresults contrasted with Jungman & Bucher\u2019s (1967) find-\nings, in which high structure improved patient compliance.\n \n1978\n \nAlden (1978) recorded nurse\u2013patient interactions, and used\nthe Ward Atmosphere Scale (WAS) to measure patients\u2019\nperceptions of the psychosocial environments of eight psy-\nchiatric wards. The WAS (Moos 1979) contains eight\ndimensions, one of which has a subscale on control, which\nmeasures how strictly nurses enforce rules and schedules.\nCertain patients tended to be withdrawn, and they per-\nceived the staff as very rigid, but they expressed less hos-\ntility than those patients within wards where the expression\nof anger was less strictly controlled. These patients were\nmore communicative, but they also tended to be more hos-\ntile and independent. This study elaborated on previous\narticles by focusing on specific patient outcomes produced\nby different ward nursing regimes. Jungman & Bucher\n(1967) and Bursten & Geach (1976) provided a generalized\nbehaviourist overview. Alden (1978) highlighted the nega-\ntive psychosocial effects of rigid regimes, and demonstrated\nthat the achievement of patient compliance may impede\nrecovery.\n \n1979\n \nLevinson & Crabtree (1979) found that adherence to the\nward structure was helpful in the management of crises in\na therapeutic community setting for hospitalized adoles-\ncents. However, the findings were based on the authors\u2019\nexperiences within one unit with no systematic methods of\ndata collection. A similar study by Watkins (1979) dis-\ncussed role ambivalence amongst residential and medical\nstaff about the use of authority. He argued for rule clarity,\nand interdisciplinary decision making in order to integrate\nthe use of authority in treatment.\n \n1980\n \nBursten \n \net al\n \n. (1980) analyzed the therapeutic value of\nrestrictive and coercive ward policies in a comparative\nstudy of patient outcomes on three wards. Ward A oper-\nated a formal step system, Ward B1 was highly restrictive\u2013\ncoercive, and compliance with treatment was mostly\noptional in Ward B3. Nurses, patients and family mem-\nbers rated outcomes during admission and at discharge.\nPatients and their significant others rated outcomes at 6-\nmonth follow-up. Ward A patients showed better adjust-\nment than those in Ward B1 or Ward B3 patients, and\nWard B1 patients\u2019 outcomes surpassed those of the Ward\nB3 sample. However, a lack of inter-rater reliability may\nhave skewed the results and the ratings may have been\ninfluenced by the patients\u2019 close relationships with their\nsignificant others. The self-rating patients may have lacked\nobjectivity. Further, they may have feared the conse-\nquences of reporting their actual levels of functioning, or\nan overly compliant group may have responded. Hypo-\nthetically, the rest of the patient sample might report\n \u00a9 \n \n2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing \n \n11\n \n, 623\u2013631\n \n625\n \nAcute psychiatric ward rules: a literature review\n \naccurately because their inpatient experiences were less\ncoercive and restrictive. The study reflects and expands on\nJungman & Bucher\u2019s (1967) findings. However, they con-\nflict with Bursten & Geach\u2019s (1976) results, which failed\nto identify different patient outcomes, but this study was\nrestricted to inpatients. Bursten \n \net al\n \n.\u2019s (1980) findings\nalso contrast with Alden\u2019s (1978) results in which patient\noutcomes were adversely effected by rigid ward nursing\nregimes, but Alden\u2019s sample was larger and restricted to\ninpatients. Alden\u2019s study was important because it began\nto question the role of staff attitudes, and the influence of\nnurse\u2013patient communication.\n \n1981\n \nFlaherty \n \net al\n \n. (1981) used WAS as a means of testing\nwhether black and white patients within the same ward\nperceived the atmosphere differently or not. The white\npatients\u2019 duration of stay was longer, and more black\npatients left the ward against medical advice. White\npatients also enjoyed more autonomy, and the authors\nhypothesized that treatment variance might have influ-\nenced differing perceptions of the ward atmosphere\nbetween the two groups. They acknowledged that cultural\nfactors might have influenced the black patients\u2019 negative\nperceptions of the ward atmosphere in that they might have\ndifferent expectations of the ward environment, which\nmight have caused them to react negatively during admis-\nsion. Further, they hypothesized that staff may have\nresponded to this behaviour with increased defensiveness.\nHowever, although diagnoses were matched, the samples\nwere undifferentiated by chronicity, and this could explain\nsome of the black patients\u2019 responses towards the\nenvironment.\n \n1983\n \nJohansen (1983) discussed the behaviour of personality-\ndisordered patients, and observed that their low tolerance\nfor frustration caused them to disregard ward rules fre-\nquently. He described a situation in which the ward became\nless flexible following an arson incident, and recommended\nconstant flexibility to facilitate individualized care. He\nwarned that chronically ill patients might be neglected\nwhen nurses impose limits on patients  with personality dis-\norder who use the rules to gain more attention. He also rec-\nommended greater structure, but this may be difficult to\ncombine with rule flexibility in the management of person-\nality disorder. Johansen\u2019s views contrasted with Levinson\n& Crabtree\u2019s (1979) recommendations in that they advo-\ncated constant adherence to the rules in order to avoid arbi-\ntrary decision making during ward crises.\n \n1988\n \nLanza (1988) studied the relationship between ward rules\nand patient assaults, and found that many incidents (32%)\noccurred within a limit setting context, or during the daily\nward routine. Nurses\u2019 recall for the antecedents of the inci-\ndents was patchy, but they reported that many attacks\noccurred in silence, without warning and with intent to do\nharm. Lanza leant towards a psychopathologic explanation\nof patient aggression, but the retrospective design, and the\ngrouping of diverse behaviours meant that there was no\nway of identifying whether aspects of the interaction trig-\ngered incidents or not. The findings contrasted with Alden\u2019s\n(1978) study in that, despite the emphasis on high struc-\nture, the staff did not intimidate the patients. This also\nreflected the reactions of patients, who were cared for in\nthe less restrictive wards in Alden\u2019s study, but Alden\nrecorded nurse\u2013patient interactions, and Lanza studied vio-\nlent incidents rather than patients\u2019 perceptions of the ward\natmosphere. The patient samples also differed in that\nLanza included psycho-geriatric groups, and their misper-\nceptions of the environment might have triggered aggres-\nsion. Despite this, it does appear that the nurses in Lanza\u2019s\nstudy might not have been overcontrolling, and if so, psy-\nchopathology could have been a factor in aggression.\n \n1989\n \nWard rules were central to a theoretical framework for\npatient violence devised by Morrison (1989). She hypoth-\nesized that patient aggression was associated with  lack of\nrule clarity and inconsistency. This hypothesis was sup-\nported by the results in that Morrison found that a rise in\nthe inconsistent application of the rules was associated\nwith an increase in non-compliance. She used the results to\ngenerate five predictors of violence, which included the dis-\ncrepant interpretation of the therapeutic rules, the incon-\nsistent enforcement of the social rules, a diagnosis of\nschizophrenia or substance abuse, and the patients\u2019 inabil-\nity to adhere to the social rules.\nPsychodynamic theory offers an alternative perspective\non the role of ward rules in patient care. Kologjera \n \net al\n \n.\n(1989) used this to describe the therapeutic use of seclusion\nin the management of disruptive adolescent behaviour.\nThey held that insecure parental boundaries did not allow\nchildren to experiment safely with new behaviours in\nsocially acceptable ways. The non-compliance by adult\npsychiatric patients may also represent an attempt to pro-\nvoke parental figures to provide clearly defined boundaries,\nand a holding environment. Kologjera \n \net al\n \n. argued that\nrule consistency could help patients test boundaries within\na secure and supportive environment. They perceived that\n J. Alexander & L. Bowers \n \n626 \u00a9 \n \n2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing \n \n11\n \n, 623\u2013631\n \nabused children compulsively repeat early experiences of\nabuse because they learned to provoke punitive parental\nattention as a means of maintaining closeness at an early\nstage of development. Nurses could be drawn into repeti-\ntions of similar punitive responses towards non-compliant\npatients, but they could provide a corrective emotional\nexperience through appropriate responses wherein the\npatient learns that support and discipline need not be puni-\ntive. This study elaborated on recommendations by Jur-\ngensen (1971), Levinson & Crabtree (1979), and Watkins\n(1979), and reflected similar ward management principles.\nThese studies contrast with Johansen\u2019s (1983) theory,\nwhich advocated rule flexibility in the management of ward\ncrises.\n \n1990\n \nLutzen (1990) found that the dominant psychiatric ideol-\nogy conflicted with nurses\u2019 moral values. Four of the cate-\ngories that emerged from the data were concerned with\nwritten or unwritten rules. When they complied with the\nauthority of the hospital, nurses followed the written rules,\nbut they subverted this when they followed the unwritten\nrules, and came to an implicit agreement that in practice,\nall the written rules could not be adhered to. Nurses felt\nthat controlling activities conflicted with their basic values,\nand they felt that they could not provide authentic nursing\ncare. They managed role ambivalence by maintaining pro-\nfessionalism, and interpreted this as distancing themselves\nfrom patients. Group alliance was another way in which\nthey coped with ideological conflict.\n \n1991\n \nRoper & Anderson (1991) found that patient violence was\nassociated with nurses\u2019 attitudes towards control. The\nresults showed that staff used the ward structure and the\ndenial of patients\u2019 requests on order to maintain control.\nThe authors made negative interpretations of limit setting,\nand seemed to divorce this from the care context. The\nauthors\u2019 perspective contrasted with that of Kologjera\n \net al\n \n.\u2019s (1989) views and those of Levinson & Crabtree\u2019s\n(1979) who advocated firm boundaries in the management\nof patients.\nIn a descriptive study, De Laune (1991) wrote about the\nmanagement of manipulative patients. She discussed the\nway that nurses tend to label this type of behaviour, and\navoid manipulative patients. This increases patients\u2019 anxi-\nety, and reinforces the behaviour. She advocated limit set-\nting as the most effective way of managing various types of\nmanipulation with the aim of:\n \n\u2022\n \nestablishing boundaries;\n \n\u2022\n \npreventing escalation; and\n \n\u2022\n \ncounteracting resistance.\nThis study strengthened the recommendations of Jurgensen\n(1971), Levinson & Crabtree (1979), Watkins (1979), and\nKologjera \n \net al\n \n. (1989) , and reflected similar ward man-\nagement principles, which conflict with Johansen\u2019s (1983)\ntheory about rule flexibility in the management of ward\ncrises.\n \n1993\n \nPatients may not perceive ward rules as punitive or\ncontrolling, and may view boundary setting as an expres-\nsion of nurses\u2019 support or concern. Caplan (1993) used\nWAS to measure the influence of the ward environment on\npatients\u2019 perceptions of control. The results highlighted dif-\nferences between the nurses\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions of\nrule clarity. Many patients were unclear about rules and\nbehavioural expectations. They also perceived higher levels\nof control than the staff, but both groups identified good\nlevels of support within the environment. Caplan suggested\nthat patients viewed control positively because it was\nimposed within a caring context. This hypothesis reflected\nKologjera \n \net al\n \n.\u2019s (1989) theory about the efficacy of a\nholding environment for patient management.\n \n1994\n \nLanza \n \net al\n \n. (1994) investigated the relationship between\npatient autonomy, ward rules and assault. The authors\nargued that ward rules reflect basic issues about patient\nautonomy and the extent of staff control. The ward with\nthe highest number of assaults in the study scored lowest\non autonomy. Conversely, the ward with the least number\nof assaults scored highest on autonomy, practical orienta-\ntion and personal problem orientation. This ward also had\nthe lowest score on staff control, and the ward with the\nhighest rates of assault also had the greatest reported levels\nof control. The authors advocated the incorporation of\ntherapeutic community ideals within psychiatric wards so\nthat rule consistency is combined with high engagement.\nLanza\u2019s \n \net al\n \n.\u2019s arguments for consistency corresponded\nwith those of Morrison (1989), but they found that auton-\nomy and low staff control produced fewer assaults. These\nresults contrasted with Alden\u2019s (1978) findings in which\nsimilar factors increased patient hostility.\nIn 1994, Morrison (1994) discussed the conclusions of\nher 1989 study, and found that they conflicted with an ear-\nlier pilot study, in which nurses associated inconsistency\nwith violence. The findings failed to predict a significant\ndegree of violence, which led her to conclude that consis-\ntency might not be vitally important, and this brought into\n \u00a9 \n \n2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing \n \n11\n \n, 623\u2013631\n \n627\n \nAcute psychiatric ward rules: a literature review\n \nquestion the value of violence prevention methods based on\nconsistency. She perceived that the model had poor pred-\nicative power, and this may have been caused by design\nproblems. The nursing staff sample was split almost\nequally between qualified nurses and aides. Both groups\nmight have approached their patients differently, and they\nmight have made different interpretations of patient behav-\niour. Diverse behaviours were grouped together, and it was\ndifficult to identify which specific aspects of nurse\u2013patient\ninteraction influenced patient outcomes. The use of quan-\ntitative methods to assess qualitative interactions seems\nproblematic. This study elaborated on previous work that\nadvocated persistent and clear limit setting for psychiatric\npatients, but also casts doubt on their recommendations\n(Jungman & Bucher 1967, Levinson & Crabtree 1979,\nBursten \n \net al\n \n. 1980).\n \n1995\n \nThe importance of rule clarity emerged in Bensley \n \net al\n \n.\u2019s\n(1995) study, which compared the views of hospital staff\nand patients about ward regimes. The results showed that\npatients and staff shared many concerns, but patients alone\nidentified a lack of rule clarity as a primary factor in influ-\nencing assaults. The study recommendations reflected Mor-\nrison\u2019s (1989) suggestions about the importance of rule\nclarity and consistency. Ward rules may be used to exert\npower over patients.\nHewison (1995) argued that nurses controlled interac-\ntions, gave orders routinely and used language to exert\npower over patients. However, the study was conducted on\none care of the elderly ward over a 3-month period, and the\nauthor generalized the findings to embrace all nurse\u2013\npatient interactions within psychiatry.\nRichardson (1995) argued that rules for patient conduct\nmust be properly devised, and established by statute in con-\nsultation with patients. Rule justification and the exercise\nof authority must be directly associated with institutional\nrequirements to maintain safety and control. A formal sys-\ntem of sanctions may not be appropriate for acute mental\nhealth units, but a modified version of the process might\nprovide a consistent, and less arbitrary response to rule\nbreaking by patients.\nA project by Morales (1995) aimed to decrease the use\nof restraints and seclusion within an acute unit through\nprevention and early intervention. The use of restrictive\nmeasures decreased by 50% through the use of verbal de-\nescalation, medication, limit setting, quiet time and listen-\ning to soft music. However, it is unclear whether the study\nthat took place on one ward for chronic psychiatric inpa-\ntients could be generalized to embrace acute wards with\nhigh levels of patient acuity and turnover.\n \n1996\n \nIn a study of the use of seclusion, Muir-Cochrane & Har-\nrison (1996) used grounded theory to gather data, and a\ncore category \u2018controlling\u2019 emerged in the practice of seclu-\nsion. They found that staff set arbitrary limits based on the\npatients\u2019 individual responses to individual nurses. The\nauthors acknowledged that the findings were not general-\nizable, but they argued that they provided a rich insight\ninto the social processes involved in the use of seclusion.\nHowever, it was unclear which behaviours were restricted\nbecause diverse behaviours were grouped together, which\nmeant that information on the antecedents and conse-\nquences of individual incidents was lacking. The study ech-\noed the findings of Roper & Anderson (1991) in which\nstaff made constant references about the need to control\npatients.\nThe number of ward rules may reflect the ward social\nclimate. Aubrey \n \net al\n \n. (1996) used WAS to measure the\nimpact of environmental changes on staff and patients in\nan acute psychiatric unit, which had relocated from a men-\ntal institution to a general hospital site. Specific changes\nwere implemented, which included rule clarity, fewer\nsearches, door locking and the flexible use of the step sys-\ntem. It was difficult to ascertain how these changes were\nachieved, but patients perceived improvements in four out\nof five social climate areas of the WAS. However, nurses\nperceived that they had less control over the ward. This\nstudy augmented previous research that advocated rule\nclarity (Morrison 1989, Bensley \n \net al\n \n. 1995).\nThe way that nurses interact with patients during the\ncourse of their duties is associated with violence, and this\nincludes rule enforcement. Whittington & Wykes (1996)\nanalyzed how often violence was preceded by a nursing\napproach or demand that patients perceived as unpleasant.\nThey identified three main precipitants of violence, which\nincluded frustration, perceived attack and activity demand.\nThey found that 86% of assaults against nurses were asso-\nciated with the adverse stimulation of patients, during the\ncare process, and they recognized that patients\u2019 mental\nstates might cause them to misinterpret non-aversive staff\nbehaviour. However, they suggested that certain nurses\nbehaved unprofessionally with the deliberate aim of\nadversely stimulating patients, e.g. by insulting, threatening\nor criticizing them. This study elaborated on the work of\n(Lanza 1988, Morrison 1989). All of the authors investi-\ngated the association between patient aggression and the\nnursing role.\nFinnema \n \net al\n \n. (1996) analyzed the association between\nrule enforcement and the levels of high expressed emotion\namongst staff. They hypothesized that nurses may create\nward environments dominated by rules in order to manage\n J. Alexander & L. Bowers \n \n628 \u00a9 \n \n2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing \n \n11\n \n, 623\u2013631\n \ndifficult situations, and designed an educational pro-\ngramme to help them use alternative interventions with\npsychotic patients. They evaluated the impact of the pro-\ngramme on levels of high expressed emotion, and the num-\nber of ward rules. The authors found that the nurses\u2019 levels\nof high expressed emotion did not change, but the number\nof ward rules decreased. However, confounding factors\ncould have caused the change, and the researchers did not\nuse a control group. The study augmented Whittington &\nWykes\u2019 (1996) findings in that high expressed emotion may\nevoke negative reactions from patients in much the same\nway as aversive stimulation, but high expressed emotion\ndiffers in that nurses may unconsciously rather than delib-\nerately display these attitudes during interactions with\npatients.\n \n1997\n \nPsychiatric nurses frequently impose rules in the denial of\npatients\u2019 requests. Nijman \n \net al\n \n. (1997) investigated the\ncircumstances surrounding aggressive incidents within a\nclosed acute psychiatric unit. The authors used the Staff\nObservation of aggression Scale (SOAS) to record the loca-\ntion and characteristics of the incidents. The findings\nshowed that out of 164 violent incidents, 32% were pre-\ncipitated because the nurses denied the patients\u2019 requests,\nbut there was no way of knowing whether other elements\nof nurse\u2013patient interaction triggered aggression. Nijman\n \net al\n \n. recognised that communication problems between\nstaff and patients might have been an important cause of\naggression. This study expanded on previous studies that\nexplored the relationship between the frustration of patient\nautonomy and aggression (Lanza 1988, Morrison 1989,\nRoper & Anderson 1991).\nOne of the categories in a qualitative study by Letendre\n(1997) showed that users held negative perceptions of the\nward regime. They felt oppressed by the degree of control\nover their activities, and identified a number of extra rules\nthat were not applied in the wider society or in other hos-\npital wards.\nCrichton (1997) analyzed the moral judgements made\nby nurses when patients break the rules. He used a case\nvignette design whereby nurses rated the management of an\nincident, and the scale included one question designed to\nmeasure perceived moral responsibility. Nurses were asked\nwhether they felt that rule breaking was driven by mental\ndisorder, free choice or lack of self control. Crichton iden-\ntified a censorious element in the responses, which raised\nquestions about the regulation of nurses\u2019 reactions towards\nnon-compliant patients. Crichton recommended the devel-\nopment of a system that acknowledged the influence of\nmoral judgements, and the incorporation of procedures\nthat might ensure justifiable responses to patient misde-\nmeanour. He acknowledged that the vignette design iso-\nlated patients\u2019 behaviour from the context, but did not\nconsider that nurses\u2019 personal experience of violence might\ninfluence the degree of censure. Crichton\u2019s recommenda-\ntions reflected Richardson\u2019s (1995) ideas, but he focused on\nthe role of nurses in making moral judgements, and Rich-\nardson focused on formalising responses after the decision\nwas made. Both studies made an important point about the\nneed to regulate institutional responses to patient misde-\nmeanour because arbitrary or subjective responses may\nlead to the inappropriate or punitive imposition of ward\nrules and sanctions.\n \n1998\n \nA comparative study by Crichton \n \net al\n \n. (1998) compared\nthe attitudes of Canadian and British nursing staff towards\nthe management of patient misdemeanour. The nurses were\nshown case vignettes, and completed a semi-structured\nquestionnaire. The Canadian results mirrored the findings\nin Crichton\u2019s (1997) study in that responses involving\nmoral censure were perceived as more useful. The results\nshowed that the use of medication and seclusion received\nhigher ratings in the Canadian sample. Conversely, talking\nand relaxation techniques were rated higher in the British\nsample. Crichton \n \net al\n \n. acknowledged that differences in\nthe data collection methods, and in the work experience\nof the participants may account for these results, but the\nauthors also hypothesized that differences in the base rate\nof serious violence in North America might be a factor.\nCrichton (1998) discussed how psychodynamic theory\nmight help the staff to understand and respond to rule\nbreaking. Classical dynamic theory gives a perspective on\ninternal control and rule keeping.\nHe draws a parallel between the encouragement of com-\npliance with psychiatric ward rules and the parental func-\ntion, and discusses how patients\u2019 previous experiences of\npoor parenting may be re-enacted by the institution if the\nstaff are not helped to manage the feelings engendered by\nrule breaking. This paper elaborates on the work of\nJurgensen (1971), Levinson & Crabtree (1979), Watkins\n(1979), and Kologjera \n \net al\n \n. (1989). Crichton\u2019s recommen-\ndations are similar, but like Johansen (1983) he advocates\nrule flexibility in certain circumstances.\nThe effect of a culture of control on the behaviour of\nnurses is pertinent to a study of ward rules. Morrison\n(1998) used causal modelling to test the hypothesis that\nstaff might display rigid attitudes towards patients if they\nperceived that organisational structures neglected personal\ndevelopment and relationship issues in favour of control.\nShe identified satisfaction with the hospital as the predom-\n \u00a9 \n \n2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing \n \n11\n \n, 623\u2013631\n \n629\n \nAcute psychiatric ward rules: a literature review\n \ninant emergent variable, and found that satisfied staff laid\nless emphasis on rules. She found that males were more\nauthoritarian than females, and nurses from lower socio-\neconomic groups were more controlling than those from\nhigher groups. She concluded that rigidity might stem from\na combination of individual characteristics and organiza-\ntional factors, but did not seem to consider that staff from\nlower socio-economic groups might not have high levels of\nqualifications or skills, and yet might be in most contact\nwith patients, which could cause them to be more restric-\ntive. Greater exposure to patient aggression amongst male\nnurses might result from social expectations of the male\nrole, and this might account for the higher incidence of this\nvariable in Morrison\u2019s analysis of the data. The study aug-\nmented the work of previous authors on the authoritarian\nattitudes of ward-based nurses (Alden 1978, Roper &\nAnderson 1991, Hewison 1995).\n \n1999\n \nThere is evidence that patients abscond because of the\nrestrictions placed upon them when they are in a hospital.\nIn a prospective study of absconding, Bowers \n \net al\n \n. (1999)\ninterviewed patients who absconded from acute admission\nwards. This study linked absconding, which could be\nviewed as a form of rule breaking with the insensitive appli-\ncation of ward rules, and with the trivialization of patients\u2019\nrequests. The role of psychiatric nurses in evoking aggres-\nsion and other negative reactions in patients during the per-\nformance of their duties emerged in several of the studies\nthat have been reviewed (Roper & Anderson 1991, Whit-\ntington & Wykes 1996).\nCrichton (1999) examined staff attitudes towards dis-\nruptive behaviour in group homes for people with learning\ndisability. Moral judgement emerged as a major factor.\nAppearance degree of learning disability and apparent dan-\nger were major variables in staff con captions of the degree\nto which residents were judged to be morally responsible\nand culpable residents. This study augmented Crichton\u2019s\n(1997) findings in which he also recommended stronger\nmanagement systems to counter the effect of censoriously\ndriven responses to patient misdemeanour. Crichton\nacknowledges the limitations of the case vignette design,\nwhich divorced the incident from its social context, but he\ndid not seem to consider that staff that had experienced\nviolence might give more censorious responses.\n \n2002\n \nMistral \n \net al\n \n. (2002) analyzed the impact of therapeutic\ncommunity principles on a high-care, 14-bed ward for the\nmanagement of detained patients. The interventions incor-\nporated improvements in communication regarding the\naims and clarity of ward rules. Clear rules and sanctions\nwere created, and were communicated to all staff and\npatients. The rules related to smoking, alcohol, the use of\nillegal substances, and communal responsibility for the\nmaintenance of the environment. Staff morale improved\nand the intervention had a positive effect on the functioning\nof the ward. The main areas of improvement were in rule\nclarity, mutual respect between staff and patients, better\ncommunication and an improved physical environment.\nHowever, the authors acknowledged that these improve-\nments might be difficult to sustain once the intervention\nphase ended. This study augmented previous research that\nadvocated rule clarity (Morrison 1989, Bensley \n \net al\n \n. 1995).\n \n2003\n \nLowe \n \net al\n \n. (2003) used case scenarios of real conflict\nevents, which were rated by nurses. The results indicated\nthat limit setting and structure were perceived as vital by\npsychiatric nurses, but that they could not be isolated from\ninterventions that demonstrated respect for patients\u2019\nautonomy. Differences in judgements between nurses of\ndifferent status emerged from the results, and higher grades\nof staff were significantly more likely to favour autonomy\nconfirming interventions.\n \nDiscussion\n \nSeveral themes emerged from the research. Many studies\nhighlighted an association between nurse\u2013patient interac-\ntion and ward rules. Arguments about the importance of\nclear communication, rule clarity and consistency emerged\nfrom the literature. The absence of these factors was linked\nto patient aggression. Most of the studies provided no rich\ntextual information about the actual content of nurse\u2013\npatient interaction.\nSeveral studies advocated high structure to modify\naggression, but an almost equal number concluded that\nrigid environments engender patient violence. The litera-\nture is divided in respect of the pros and cons of high struc-\nture, and needs to be more firmly grounded in evidence.\nThis division of opinion means that we cannot establish\nwhether rigid or flexible environments are the best way of\nmanaging psychiatric wards. The psychodynamic articles\nprovide an alternative perspective on the use of ward rules.\nThe authors argued that highly structured environments\nprovide a corrective emotional experience, particularly for\npatients with personality disorder. What appears to be\nmissing is a study that identifies the specific rule that is\nbeing implemented together with the antecedents and\nconsequences.\n J. Alexander & L. Bowers \n \n630 \u00a9 \n \n2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, \n \nJournal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing \n \n11\n \n, 623\u2013631\n \nThe issue of sanctions was explored, but only one study\nconsidered whether rule imposition is ethically justifiable\nor not in terms of patient outcomes. The ethical conflicts\nexperienced by nurses in carrying out prescribed care for\npatients was analyzed by one researcher, but it is surprising\nthat there are no studies focusing on the ethics of rule\nimplementation. This issue may be highly sensitive because\na study of ward rules highlights the relationship between\npunishment and treatment within psychiatry.\nThe potential to abuse ward rules to elicit patient com-\npliance is not fully explored, and this is where issues about\ntreatment and punishment converge. The boundaries\nbetween the treatment of psychiatric disorder and the con-\ntrol of behaviour are often blurred. A study designed to\nexplore the ethical decision-making processes of nurses in\nrelation to rule imposition and rule breaking might illumi-\nnate this grey area. Only one study was found that\nexplored the relationship between race and rule implemen-\ntation. A study focusing on the association between ethnic-\nity and ward rules might help to define a framework that\nmight embrace the differing cultural backgrounds of\npatients.\nThe view that patients are not just objecting to rule\nimposition during violent incidents emerges from the liter-\nature, and so does the argument that patient aggression is\nnot solely produced by psychopathology. Several research-\ners intimated that the way in which nurses\u2019 approach\npatients during rule imposition is important in the preven-\ntion of aggression. The studies indicated that patients\nmight refuse to comply and become aggressive when the\nrules are imposed in an insensitive and punitive manner.\nHowever, patients may view rules positively, if they per-\nceive that the motivation for rule implementation arises\nfrom concern for their welfare.\nThe data related to ward rules tended to be group\ndiverse behaviours, and most failed to identify specific\naspects of nurse\u2013patient interaction. Therefore, informa-\ntion about the rule that was being implemented and inter-\nactive elements are lost. This review has identified a gap in\nthe literature in relation to a specific and comprehensive\nstudy of ward rules. However, the evidence points to an\nimportant relationship between ward rules and patient vio-\nlence, and to a link between nurse\u2013patient interaction and\nrule implementation. The findings reviewed above do not\nlead to sufficiently firm conclusions upon which to base\npatient care. An in-depth study of ward rules could address\nthe important issues raised in this review of the literature.\n \nReferences\n \nAlden L.
