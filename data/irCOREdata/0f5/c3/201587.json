But \norganizations use a wide variety of means to \nmotivate their workers. One such method, which \nhas not been studied much to date, is the explicit \ncreation of status rewards attached to good per-\nformance.\u0004 Under such schemes, an agent is \ngiven a positional good\u2014such as a job title or \na medal\u2014whose value comes from its scarcity. \nSome organizations, such as the military, make \nextensive use of medals as status rewards rather \nthan making cash payments. Academia, too, is \nawash with job titles, fellowships, and prizes \nwhose value is mostly symbolic, but which con-\nvey status on their recipients.\nIn this paper, we consider the role of such \nstatus awards as an incentive device. We allow \na principal to reward an agent for good perfor-\nmance in conventional terms (i.e., with money) \nand\/or by giving him a positional good. We sup-\npose that the latter has a zero marginal cost. \n(We have in mind rewards like \u201cemployee of the \nmonth\u201d or \u201cfull professor\u201d or \u201cvice president.\u201d) \nTo the extent that the positional good is valued, \nthe organization is exploiting a preference for \nstatus to motivate agents. However, the extent of \nthe status conveyed depends on how scarce the \nreward is and requires a well-defined rule that \nrewards only the deserving.\nThe paper studies a model with moral hazard \nand limited liability which limits the ability of \nan organization to achieve its desired effort level \nusing monetary incentives. In addition to the \n\u0004  Exceptions include Benny Moldovanu, Aner Sela, and \nXianwen Shi (2007), Bruno Frey (2007), and Emmanuelle \nAuriol and R\u00e9gis Renault (forthcoming).\nStatus Incentives\nBy Timothy Besley and Maitreesh Ghatak*\nstandard problems that stem from this, we add the \npossibility that desired output is hard to measure. \nSpecifically, even if the final output is observable, \nwe assume that it is not verifiable. The principal \nneeds to condition rewards on an imperfect, but \ncontractible, signal of achievement. Even if the \nprincipal can observe the true output, it will not \nbe ex post incentive compatible for him to pay \na reward to an agent who has produced it.2 The \nfact that status incentives are costless means that \nthey are ex post incentive compatible in such cir-\ncumstances. By the same token, status incentives \nalso increase effort while reducing the optimal \nlevel of monetary incentives.\nThe economic implications of the idea that \nhuman beings have a craving for status has been \nwidely studied (see, for example, Robert H. \nFrank \u0004985). A key component of the quest for \nstatus comes from the fact that humans make \nsocial comparisons when assessing the value of \nwhat they receive, something that has recently \nbeen found in brain activity (see K. Fleissbach \net al. 2007) and in studies of subjective happi-\nness (see Richard Layard 2005). This paper is \nalso linked to the literature on how concerns \nabout fairness and inequality affect wage struc-\ntures within firms. Recent empirical evidence \nby Gordon D. A. Brown et al. (forthcoming) \nsuggests that an individual\u2019s rank in the wage \ndistribution affects job satisfaction even when \nmonetary wage differentials are controlled for. \nOur paper is also related to the work of Ernst \nFehr and Klaus M. Schmidt (\u0004999) who empha-\nsize the role of relative rewards within organi-\nzations due to perceptions of fairness and their \nimplications for the design of incentives.\nThis paper is part of a wider project that \nconsiders how organizations foster effort using \nmeans other than  the promise of money (or pri-\nvate goods). The use of status is a way of creating \n\u201cmotivated agents\u201d in the sense of Besley and \n2 This clearly depends on the fact that we have a static \nmodel. For example, we do not consider the use of relational \nincentive contracts along the lines of George P. Baker, \nRobert Gibbons, and Kevin J.

It is also related to recent work \nby George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton (2005) \nwho discuss the importance of creating identi-\nties to improve organizational performance.\nI.\u2002 The\u2002Benchmark\u2002Model\nA principal employs a continuum of agents of \nsize one, each of whom works independently on \na project whose success depends on effort and \nis uncorrelated across the agents. The project \nyields an output p0 in all states of the world. In \naddition, it generates p . 0 for the principal if \nis successful. The agent\u2019s effort e determines \nthe probability of success. We assume e [ 30, \u00044 \nand the cost of effort is c\/2 e2. The agent has an \noutside option of u which we set at zero.\u0004 We \nassume also that the agent has no wealth, i.e., \nthere is limited liability.\nFollowing Baker (\u0004992), we assume that \nthe stochastic part of the principal\u2019s payoff is \nobservable but not verifiable. However, there is \na contractible signal s [ 50,  \u00046 on which con-\ntracts can be conditioned. It is important to note \nthat, even though the principal\u2019s payoff may \nbe observable, the fact that it is not verifiable \nmeans that there is no ex post incentive-com-\npatible means of rewarding the agent when he \nproduces p. This is because the principal would \nalways have an incentive to lie after p is real-\nized in the event that s 5 0 and the output is \np. This weakens the ability of the principal to \ncreate incentives for the agent to overcome the \nmoral hazard problem.\nLet g 1\u00042 denote the probability that the sig-\nnal is s 5 \u0004 when the project is successful and \nlet g 102 denote the probability that the sig-\nnal is s 5 \u0004 when the project is a failure. We \nassume that the signal is (weakly) informative \nin the sense that g 1\u00042 $ g 102 . If g 1\u00042 5 \u0004 and \ng 102 5 0, then output is perfectly observed.\nAll agents are identical, so we can study the \ndetermination of incentives for a representative \nagent. As a benchmark, consider the first best \nwhere effort is chosen to maximize the joint \nsurplus of the principal and agent. This yields \neffort level\n e* 5 arg max\ne\n eep 2 c2  e2f 5 pc .\n\u0004 It would be straightforward, although taxanomic, to \nextend the model to the case where the participation con-\nstraint binds.\nWe assume p\/c , \u0004 to focus on interior solutions.\nA contract is a pair 5b 1s2 6s[50, \u00046 . It is \nstraightforward to solve for the optimal incen-\ntive scheme. Let D 5 g 1\u00042 2 g 102 . First, observe \nthat the optimal effort level of the agent is\n e\u02c6 5 arg max\ne\n 5eD 3b 1\u00042 2 b 102 4\n 1 3g 102 3b 1\u00042 2 b 102 4\t 1 b 102 2 c2  e24 6\t 5 D 3b 11 2 2 b 10 2 4c .\nPlugging this into the principal\u2019s payoff func-\ntion, she chooses the contract to maximize\n \nD 3b 11 2 2 b 10 2 4\nc  3p 2 D 3b 1\u00042 2 b 102 4 4\t \t \t 2 g 102b 1\u00042 2 1\u0004 2 g 102 2b 102 .\nThis yields:\nPROPOSITIOn \u0004. the optimal contract sets \nb 10 2 5 0 and\n b 1\u00042 5 max e0, pD 2 g 10 2c2D2 f .\nthe corresponding effort level is\n e 5 max e0, b 11 2Dc f .\nThis result is intuitive. It is optimal to reduce \nb 102 down to the minimum possible level (given \nlimited liability), i.e., 0, as extra effort can be \nelicited while reducing the principal\u2019s cost. The \ninteresting issue is whether it is worthwhile to \noffer a bonus when the verifiable signal s 5 \u0004 \nis observed. Here, Proposition \u0004 says that, if the \noutput is sufficiently well measured, there is pos-\nitive incentive pay to elicit effort. Specifically, \nthis will be the case if\n \np\nc  $ \ng 10 2\nD\n,\nwhich is more likely to be satisfied the higher is \ng 1\u00042 and the lower is g 102 . In particular, it will \nalways hold when g 102 is close enough to zero. \nIf this condition does not hold, it is not worth-\nwhile for the principal to use any incentive pay \nMAY 2008208 AEA PAPERS AND PROcEEDINGS\nat all. This is basically the main finding of Baker \n(\u0004992) applied to this framework.\nII.\u2002 Introducing\u2002Status\u2002Incentives\nWe now allow the principal to introduce a \npurely nominal reward\u2014a pure positional good \nto the agent in the event that he produces high \noutput for the principal. As discussed above, \nthis could be a job title change (promotion from \nassociate to full professor), granting some agents \ninterior offices rather than open-plan desks, or \ncalling some employees \u201cemployee of the week.\u201d \nWe focus on the case where this good is com-\npletely free from the principal\u2019s point of view.\nWe denote the award of a discrete positional \ngood by h [ 50, \u00046 and suppose that this good \ngenerates utility of h 1e\u02c6 2\twhere e\u02c6 is the fraction \nof workers in the organization who are awarded \nthe positional good. Assume that h9 1e\u02c6 2 , 0 and \nh 1e\u02c6 2 5 0 for e\u02c6 $ e\u2013 where e\u2013 # \u0004. This says that \nthere is a crowding effect\u2014if everyone gets the \npositional good, then its value goes to zero.\u0004\nWe assume that granting the honor is part of \nan implicit contract and could, in principle, be \nconditioned on p rather than just s. However, \nit has to be incentive compatible for the prin-\ncipal to award the positional good to everyone \nwho produces p after output is realized. This \nis where the fact that the positional good has a \nzero marginal cost plays a key role and differs \nfrom monetary incentives. The principal is actu-\nally indifferent about awarding the positional \ngood to anyone, so it is weakly optimal for him \nto commit to a rule h 1p2 5 \u0004 and h 102 5 0, i.e., \nstatus is conferred only on those who produce \nhigh output. This is an important feature of \npurely nominal rewards, which we record as:\nPROPOSITIOn 2: Even though the principal\u2019s \npayoff is not verifiable, it is incentive compatible \nfor the principal to award the positional good to \nevery agent who produces high output.\n\u0004 It is possible to provide more explicit micro-foundations \nfor this preference. Consider, for example, a simple career-\nconcerns setting. Suppose that there are high-ability types \nin the population who always produce high output and a \nfraction a of the agents is of that kind. Status (and possibly \nfuture rewards) come from being this type. Then, with com-\nmon effort level e\u02c6 among the low ability agents, the prob-\nability that the agent is good conditional on having received \nthe award is a\/ 1a 1 1\u0004 2 a 2 e\u02c6 2 , which is decreasing in e\u02c6. \nOf course, the case where the positional good \nis costless is the extreme case, but there is a \n difference between rewards that exploit status \nfrom those that require money (as in a dynamic \nmodel along the lines of Baker, Gibbons, and \nMurphy \u000499\u0004) since it will generally require less \nstringent reputational enforcement in a dynamic \nsetting.\nWe now consider how awarding positional \ngoods to all agents who produce p affects the \nchoice of monetary incentives. To get a simple \nclosed-form solution, suppose that\n u 2 le\u02c6 if e\u02c6 # u\/l\n h 1e\u02c6 2\t5 \u2022\t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t \t .\n 0 otherwise\nThus, e\u2013 5 u\/l is the fraction of agents produc-\ning high effort above which the value of status \ngoes to zero.5\nIn this case, organizational effort (in a nash \nequilibrium) will be\n e\u02c6 5 \nu 1 D 3b 11 2 2 b 10 2 4\nc 1 l ,\nwhich we assume is less than u\/l. Repeating the \nlogic that lead to Proposition \u0004, we now have:\nPROPOSITIOn \u0004: the optimal contract sets \nb 10 2 5 0 and\n b 1\u00042 5 max e0, 1p 2 u 2  D 2 g 10 2 1c 1 l 22D2 f .\nthe corresponding effort level is\n e 5 \nu 1 Db 11 2\nc 1 l .\nIt is clear, upon inspection, that b 1\u00042 is lower \ncompared to the previous case. The condition \nfor e to be lower in this case is D\/c , u\/l, which \nholds given our assumption above that e\u02c6 , u\/l, \ntogether with the fact that b 1\u00042 , 1p 2 c 2\/2D.\nThis result gives a clear idea of how adding \nstatus incentives has an impact on the choice of \nmonetary compensation. They relax monetary \n5 One possible interpretation of this formulation is as \nfollows. Suppose that u 5 l. Then 1\u0004 2 e\u02c6 2 is the percentage \nof workers who do not succeed, and hence the size of group \nto whom the successful group feels superior.\nVOL. 98 NO. 2 209StAtuS INcENtIVES\nincentives in two distinct ways. First, there is a \ndirect effect due to the fact that status incentives \ncreate motivated agents in the sense of Besley and \nGhatak (2005). Second, there is an indirect effect \ndue to crowding whereby increasing monetary \nrewards reduce the value of status and hence \nreduce the principal\u2019s use of monetary incentives.\nWe will now see a bonus being offered when \ns 5 \u0004 if, and only if,\n \np 2 u\nc 1 l  $ \ng 10 2\nD\n.\nThe condition for the use of incentive pay to be \noptimal for the principal is more stringent than \nin the absence of status incentives. Intuitively, \nincentive pay is costly while status is costless \nfrom the principal\u2019s point of view.\nWhat is the incentive of the firm to use status \nincentives? We show that firms that use status \nincentives will have higher payoffs, other things \nbeing equal. The expected payoff of the princi-\npal from a single agent, in the case of an interior \nsolution, is\n P 5 p0 1 ep 2 Deb 1\u00042 2 g 102b 1\u00042 .\nAs b 1\u00042 5 3 1c 1 l 2 e 2 u 4\/D, this can be viewed \nas a function of e. Since the principal can be \nviewed as \u201cchoosing\u201d e via b 1\u00042 by the envelope \ntheorem, only the direct effect of u needs to be \nconsidered. This turns out to be\n(\u0004)  \n'P\n'u\n 5 e 1 \ng 10 2\nD\n . 0.\nThat is, the principal always benefits from \nhaving a status-motivated agent, and since cre-\nating status incentives is costless in our frame-\nwork, will always do so. The intuition is simple: \nanything that raises effort for \u201cfree\u201d will raise \nexpected profits.\nIII.\u2002 Implications\nOur model has implications for the balance \nof monetary and status incentives that we are \nlikely to see an organization use. Even though \nan organization faces no variable cost in creating \n status incentives, suppose that it bears a fixed \ncost in setting up such a system of rewards. We \nare interested in understanding which firms will \nmake use of such incentives.\nDifferentiating (\u0004) yields\n \n'2P\n'u'p\n 5 \n1\n2 1c 1 l 2  . 0.\nHence, firms with higher returns from high out-\nput will tend to benefit most from introducing \nstatus incentives. To see this, observe that how \nmuch expected profits go up when u increases \ndepends on e which is increasing in p.\nThe model also predicts that the case for \nstatus incentives is stronger the more severe is \nthe problem of measuring p. To see this most \nclearly, we normalize g 1\u00042 1 g 102 5 \u0004 and let \nq ; g 102 5 \u0004 2 g 1\u00042 . The higher is q, the less \ninformative is s as a measure of high output. \nnow it is straightforward to show that\n \n'2P\n'u'q  5 \n1\n2 11 2 2q 2 2  . 0.\nTo understand this, note that an increase in \nu raises expected profits via two channels. \nFirst, it raises effort for a given bonus level. \nSecond, it enables the firm to reduce the \nbonus. Bonuses are a costly and inefficient \ninstrument to elicit effort when the signal of \noutput is noisy. As a result, if q goes up, even \nthough the first source of the gain is smaller, \nthe second source of the gain is large and the \nnet effect is to raise the marginal gain from \nhaving motivated workers.\nWe record these facts as:\nPROPOSITIOn \u0004: All firms gain from using \nstatus incentives, but the gains are higher for \nfirms where output is harder to verify and the \nreturn to higher output is greater.\nThe finding that status incentives are incen-\ntive compatible hinges on there being no possi-\nbility of agents bribing the principal to receive \na status reward. Since such rewards can be cre-\nated for free and they are valuable to agents, \nthere is the possibility of corruption within in \nthe organization, which would undermine the \nsuccess of these rewards, since in the limit they \nwill be sold by the principal to a point where \nh 1e 2 5 0. This explains why, in practice, orga-\nnizations that use status incentives may go to \npains to point out that they are given out only \nMAY 2008210 AEA PAPERS AND PROcEEDINGS\nto the deserving, and that there is no market in \nsuch rewards.\u0004\nStatus incentives work by creating social divi-\nsions. So far, we have assumed that they raise \nthe utility of the winner while having no impact \non the utility of those who are not awarded \nthem. But this need not be the case. It could even \nbe true that the disutility from the shame that \naccrues from not receiving a positional good \noutweighs the utility from the honor among \nthose who receive it.7 This creates a potential \ncost to the principal of introducing status incen-\ntives. In the current setting, however, where the \nagent gets a rent from working for the principal, \nthis cost is not internalized by the principal.8 So \nstatus incentives could be introduced even in sit-\nuations where the welfare of agents goes down.\nTo illustrate this formally, for simplicity, sup-\npose that g 1\u00042 5 \u0004, g 102 5 0, and l 5 0. Suppose \nthat status yields utility u\u2013 and failure to achieve \nstatus yields 2u\u2013. now, e\u02c6 5 1p 1 u\u2013 1 u\u2013 2 \/2c \nand b 1\u00042 5 3p 2 1u\u2013 1 u\u20132 4\/29. It is straightfor-\nward to show that introducing a status reward \nraises agent utility if, and only if,\n \n1\n8  1p 1 u\u2013 1 u\u201322 2 18 p2 . c u\u2013.\nThis can never hold if u\u2013 5 u\u2013 5 u, i.e., when the \ndisutility of low status exactly offsets the utility of \ngaining status.\u00040 The intuition is simple. Suppose \nwe set u\u2013 5 0 and consider a small increase in \nu\u2013 starting from 0. By the envelope theorem, the \neffect via e can be ignored. However, the bonus \nwill go down and, in addition, there is a first-\norder negative effect on the agent\u2019s utility condi-\ntional on failure. As a result, he is worse off. In \n\u0004 The creation of honor from a status reward also comes \nfrom a general perception that those who receive the reward \nhave produced high output. This would be the case we have \nassumed where p is observable, but not verifiable. However, \nit would be interesting to explore the role of status rewards \nwhere whether an agent has produced p is not observed by \neveryone in the organization.\n7 Of course, the same could also be true of regular \nincentive pay. However, for positional goods, as opposed to \nmoney, this effect seems more plausible.\n8 This would not be the case if the outside option con-\nstraint was binding.\n9 This assumes that p . u\u2013\n \n1 u\u2013.\u00040 To see this, observe that this condition reduces to 1p 1 u 2\/2c . \u0004, which contradicts the requirement that e\u02c6 \n5 1p 1 2u 2\/2c , \u0004. \ncontrast, if u\u2013 goes up from 0, by a similar logic \nthe bonus will go down, but this will be domi-\nnated by the first-order effect of the utility con-\nditional of success. naturally, the higher is u\u2013 the \nmore likely the agent is worse off.\nIV.\u2002 Concluding\u2002Comments\nThis paper has studied the role of status \n incentives by firms to increase effort. In future\nwork it would be interesting to look at broader \naspects of status incentives, especially the con-\ntrast between those created within firms with \nthose creating outside firms (such as national \nhonors systems and professional honors).\nREFEREnCES\nAkerlof,\u2002 George\u2002 A.,\u2002 and\u2002 Rachel\u2002 E.\u2002 Kranton.\u2002\n2005. \u201cIdentity and the Economics of Orga-\nnizations.\u201d Journal of Economic Perspectives, \n\u00049(\u0004): 9\u2013\u00042.\nAuriol,\u2002 Emmanuelle,\u2002 and\u2002R\u00e9gis\u2002 Renault.\u2002Forth-\ncoming. \u201cStatus and Incentives.\u201d\u2002RAND Jour-\nnal of Economics.\nBaker,\u2002George\u2002P.\u2002\u0004992. \u201cIncentive Contracts and \nPerformance Measurement.\u201d Journal of Politi-\ncal Economy, \u000400(\u0004): 598\u2013\u0004\u0004\u0004.\nBaker,\u2002 George\u2002 P.,\u2002 Robert\u2002 Gibbons,\u2002 and\u2002 Kevin\u2002\nJ.\u2002 Murphy.\u2002 \u000499\u0004. \u201cSubjective Performance \nMeasures in Optimal Incentive Contracts.\u201d \nQuarterly Journal of Economics, \u000409(\u0004): \n\u0004\u000425\u20135\u0004.\nBaker,\u2002George\u2002P.,\u2002Robert\u2002Gibbons,\u2002and\u2002Kevin\u2002J.\u2002\nMurphy.\u20022002. \u201cRelational Contracts and the \nTheory of the Firm.\u201d Quarterly Journal of \nEconomics, \u0004\u00047(\u0004), \u00049\u20138\u0004.\nBesley,\u2002 Timothy,\u2002 and\u2002 Maitreesh\u2002 Ghatak.\u2002 2005. \n\u201cCompetition and Incentives with Motivated \nAgents.\u201d American Economic Review, 95(\u0004): \n\u0004\u0004\u0004\u2013\u0004\u0004.\nBrown,\u2002Gordon\u2002D.\u2002A.,\u2002Jonathan\u2002Gardner,\u2002Andrew\u2002\nOswald,\u2002 and\u2002 Jing\u2002Qian.\u2002Forthcoming. \u201cDoes \nWage Rank Affect Employees\u2019 Well-being?\u201d \nIndustrial Relations.\nFehr,\u2002 Ernst,\u2002 and\u2002 Klaus\u2002 M.\u2002 Schmidt.\u2002 \u0004999. \u201cA \nTheory of Fairness, Competition, and Coop-\neration.\u201d Quarterly Journal of Economics, \n\u0004\u0004\u0004(\u0004): 8\u00047\u2013\u00048.\nFleissbach,\u2002K.,\u2002B.\u2002Weber,\u2002P.\u2002Trautner,\u2002T.\u2002Dohmen,\u2002\nU.\u2002Sunde,\u2002C.\u2002E.\u2002Elger,\u2002and\u2002A.\u2002Falk.\u20022007. \u201cSocial \nComparisons Affects Reward-Related Brain \nVOL. 98 NO. 2 211StAtuS INcENtIVES\nActivity in the Human Ventral Stratum.\u201d Sci-\nence, \u0004\u00048(585\u0004): \u0004\u000405\u201308.\nFrank,\u2002 Robert\u2002 H.\u2002 \u0004985. choosing the Right \nPond: Human Behavior and the Quest for \nStatus. new York: Oxford University Press.\nFrey,\u2002Bruno\u2002S.\u20022007. \u201cAwards as Compensation.\u201d \nEuropean Management Review, \u0004(\u0004): \u0004\u2013\u0004\u0004.\nLayard,\u2002Richard.\u20022005.
