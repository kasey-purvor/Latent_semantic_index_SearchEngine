In a \ndeveloped country setting the majority of OAG cases will remain undiagnosed \nby current case finding strategies (9).  \nRisk factors for developing OAG are raised intraocular pressure (IOP), increasing \nage, black ethnicity, family history of glaucoma, myopia and diabetes (9). A key \ncriterion for a screening programme is that early detection leads to a better \noutcome than late detection. A systematic review (two trials, 500 patients) of \ntreatment effectiveness, demonstrated that treatment reduces the risk of \nprogression in early disease (16).   Population screening for OAG might allow the \nearly treatment and hence reduce the incidence of visual impairment and \nblindness.  However, it is important to know if the screening for OAG is cost-\neffective but existing economic evaluations are insufficient for evidence-based \nrecommendations (13). The aim of this study was to model the cost-effectiveness \nof screening for OAG compared with current practice, in the UK, of opportunistic \ncase finding.   \n \n2 Methods \nThe Model \nWe developed a Markov Model (MM)(Figure 1) (7;20). Health state definitions \n(see website, Box 1) were based on the severity of binocular visual field loss, \n5 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nadapted from a scoring system of the integrated visual field,  reported by Crabb \nand colleagues (10). \nThe model structure allows individuals to enter as healthy (no OAG), and at \nvarying degrees of OAG severity. Over time, healthy individuals can develop \nOAG (i.e. new incident cases), while those with OAG can develop more severe \ndisease and eventual visual impairment. The treatment states refer to treated \ndisease at each stage. The absorbing state in the model is death and individuals \ncan move into this state from any other state within the model. \nThe model allows for a cohort of the population, some with OAG, to pass \nthrough different strategies.  The model identifies that strategy which leads to the \nlargest proportion of individuals with OAG \u201ccrossing the bridge\u201d into treatment \n(Figure 1).  A complete version of the model can be obtained from the authors.  \nModel strategies  \nWe considered three strategies within the model: current practice and two \nalternative screening strategies.  Current UK practice involves the opportunistic \nidentification of cases by community optometrists as part of a routine eye test. \nThere are many tests and configurations of testing arrangements that are \npotentially suitable for an OAG screening programme; the modelled pathways \nwere determined by consensus by an expert panel.  The two alternative screening \nstrategies vary in how screening would be organised. In one, individuals are \ninvited for a screening examination by a glaucoma trained optometrist and \nundergo a complete glaucoma assessment involving a measure of IOP, an \nassessment of the optic nerve and a visual field test.  In the second strategy, \nindividuals are invited for an automated test quantifying functional visual field \n6 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nloss or structural damage of the optic nerve, together with a measurement of IOP, \nby a technician and individuals identified as at risk are then referred for a full \nglaucoma assessment by a glaucoma optometrist.  In all three strategies any \nindividual identified as positive at the end of screening or case finding would be \nreferred to an ophthalmologist for definitive diagnosis and, if necessary, \ntreatment. \nGlaucoma treatments \nOnce OAG is diagnosed, we have assumed that treatment would be initiated.  \nThere is a cascade of eye drop treatment options for each disease stage as well as \ntheir combination with laser or surgical treatment.  Evidence on their \neffectiveness suggested that these could be approximated by a single effect size \nbut treatment might vary by OAG severity and progression rate. We assumed \ninitial medical treatment by a beta blocker or prostaglandin analogue, followed   \nby an additional drop of another class of medications if initial treatment was \nineffective.  For those for whom this fails, argon trabeculoplasty or surgery \n(trabeculectomy) is the next treatment step.  In addition to medications, \ntreatment involves visits to the ophthalmologist every six weeks at the beginning \nof treatment and a full assessment every six months.  After surgery the patient \nwould be seen at an ophthalmology outpatient clinic at one, two, four, eight, 12, \nand 26 weeks post surgery.   \nParameter estimates used in the model \n We obtained the model parameter estimates (Table 1) from a series of systematic \nreviews of test accuracy, epidemiology, treatment effectiveness and cost-\n7 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \neffectiveness as well as other systematic, focused searches. Detailed description \nof the parameters estimates can be found in Burr and colleagues (9). \nProbabilities \nTable 1a reports the prevalence, incidence and progression of glaucoma \nparameters used.  As there were many potential target groups, each with \ndifferent risk levels, we ran the model for a range of prevalence values, aiming to \nidentify a prevalence where screening might be considered worthwhile, and thus \nthe population most likely to benefit from screening.  \nData on the annual probabilities of having an eye test, by sex and age came from \nthe British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) (4). We obtained screening \nacceptance data from the epidemiology review (9). \nWe did not identify any studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of current \npractice, thus we derived sensitivity and specificity estimates from Tuck and \ncolleagues (23), the most appropriate, in terms of geographical coverage, number \nof patients seen and number of participating optometrists.  \nThe accuracy of the glaucoma optometrist testing was taken from a recent study \nby Azuara-Blanco and colleagues (6), a Scottish comparative, masked, \nperformance study. Data from the Baltimore Eye Survey (19) were used for the \nestimation of the proportion of normal or OAG patients with one of the main risk \nfactors for OAG, IOP \u2265 26mmHg (19). Estimation of the proportion of people able \nto perform the test (rate of indeterminancy) required for the \u2018technician\u2019 \nscreening strategy came from the systematic review of screening tests (9).  The \nmodel used sensitivity and specificity values for the technician further test equal \n8 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nto or greater than 0.8. As the systematic review showed that no one test or test \ncombination was clearly more accurate and acceptable, we included a range of \nsensitivity and specificity values in the model, rather than modelling the \nperformance of one test or combination thereof. Finally, ophthalmologist \nassessment was assumed as the reference standard.  For probabilistic sensitivity \nanalysis we assumed beta distributions for all parameters except for: technician \nfurther test indeterminacy, sensitivity and specificity and the proportion of \npeople referred for observation as glaucoma suspects by an ophthalmologist\u2019s \ndiagnostic assessment (uniform distributions).  \nCosts \nTable 1b shows the cost data used (2006 pounds sterling).  We used a 2% inflation \nrate for adjustments into a common price year, where no inflation rate indices \nwere available. Where no information on ranges was obtainable we assumed a \ntriangular distribution and rates of 0.5 and 1.5 times the likeliest value were used \nas lower and upper limits.  We obtained the cost for the optometrist test from the \nNHS \u2018sight\u2019 test fees (3).  For the purposes of costing we assumed that the IOP \ntesting used Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) with disposable tips, and  \nthat the glaucoma optometrist assessment used the same test combination as \nophthalmologist diagnosis (a combination of IOP measurement by GAT, slit \nlamp examination, fundoscopy, and a visual field test). The cost of \nophthalmologist diagnosis was based on the cost of two standard ophthalmology \noutpatient consultations (5) and for the observation state cost where patients \njudged at risk would be seen yearly for up to five years or until OAG was \ndiagnosed.  \n9 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \n We estimated the treatment costs from a European study including data from \n194 patients, containing data for the UK by severity of glaucoma (22).  The \nlikeliest value for the cost of visual impairment was taken to be the mean value of \nthe last two disease stages (22) as these corresponded to the visual impairment \ncategory used in this study.  We assumed a triangular distribution for \nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis. \nWe used the NHS fees for optometrists in Scotland for the glaucoma optometrist \nassessment (2), and costs for the \u2018technnican screening strategy\u2019 from the Scottish \nDiabetic Retinopathy Screening study (1), and the screening invitation costs \n(Table 1.b) from the same study.  \nQuality of life and Utilities \nWe used EQ-5D utility estimates from a recent UK study involving almost 300 \nparticipants (8),  including a subjective and objective assessment of glaucoma \nseverity.  We used the objective scores for each health state for the base case and \nsubjective scores in the sensitivity analysis (Table 1b).  We developed the utility \nstate for visual impairment using weight data for the glaucoma severe state and \nthe relative difference from Gupta and colleagues (12). We attached Beta \ndistributions to these glaucoma utility weights parameters.(web site  Briggs 2006)  \nWe assumed that there were no differences in the utility between undiagnosed \nOAG and treated OAG at each level of severity.  \nBase case analysis \nWe ran the base case analysis for cohorts of 40, 60 and 75 year old males, for a \nrange of prevalence values, for a lifetime horizon with screening occurring every \n10 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nthree years, and conducted from the UK National Health Service (NHS) \nperspective.   The cycle length was set at one year and a 3.5% discount rate was \nused.(web site NICE 2004)  The results are presented in incremental cost-\neffectiveness ratios (ICERs).  We undertook probabilistic analyses for ranges of \nOAG prevalence from 0.1% to 10%.   \nSensitivity analysis \nOne way, two-way and multiway sensitivity analyses for the main parameters \nwithin the model were conducted, almost all of which were combined with \nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis.  \nIn these analyses we explored the effects of longer screening intervals (e.g. five \nand ten years) and varying the annual probability of a community optometrist \neye test (2%, 13%, 37%) uptake rates using one-way sensitivity analysis.  We \nvaried the sensitivity and specificity of the technician test within plausible ranges \nof 0.5 to 1.0 for sensitivity and 0.8 to 1.0 for specificity.  \nAdditionally, we performed several targeted sensitivity analyses on a 40 year old \ncohort, at a 5% (except where otherwise stated) OAG prevalence rate and a ten \nyear screening interval (a combination which seemed most likely to be cost-\neffective). As the group of individuals with higher OAG prevalence rate would \nhave a higher chance of visiting the optometrist, we conducted an analysis \nassuming 1.5 times and twice the probability of having an eye test for current \npractice strategy. We used alternative triangular probability distributions for \nprogression and incidence using lower and upper base case limits as more likely \nvalues.  We also explored the impact of using subjective glaucoma severity based \nhealth state utilities (8). We also conducted high and low cost scenario analyses.   \n11 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nFinally, we used one-way sensitivity analysis to identify threshold values for the \nannual cost of visual impairment to explore the effect of widening the \nperspective of the analysis. This final analysis was conducted for 1% and 5% \nprevalence rate of OAG. \n \n3 Results  \nTable 2 reports the estimated relative cost-effectiveness by screening strategy at \ndifferent levels of prevalence of OAG for cohorts aged 40, 60 and 75 years \nrespectively.  In each analysis as prevalence increases, costs increase and QALYs \nfall for all three strategies and all age cohorts.  In each analysis at each prevalence \nlevel and age group considered, current practice is the least costly but also the \nleast effective of the three strategies.  Adopting a \u2018technician\u2019 stategy is more \neffective but more costly than current practice and screening by a glaucoma \noptometrist is more effective but more costly than the \u2018technician\u2019 screening \nstrategy. \nFor each age group considered the ICER from adopting \u2018technician\u2019 screening \ncompared with current practice falls as prevalence increases.  Similarly, for each \nage group considered, the ICER gained from adopting \u2018glaucoma optometrist\u2019 \nscreening compared with \u2018technician\u2019 screening also falls as prevalence increases. \nIn the base case analysis for a 40 year-olds cohort a \u2018technician\u2019 screening strategy \ncompared with current practice has an ICER that society might be willing to pay \nwhen prevalence is approximately 6% to 10% (Table 2) and over 10% for a 60 \nyear-olds.  For a 75 year-olds cohort, current practice strategy has an ICER that \nmight be considered worthwhile (Table 2) even when prevalence level is 20% \n12 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \n(not shown).  Furthermore, for no age cohort and no prevalence level is screening \nby the glaucoma optometrist instead of screening by the technician associated \nwith an ICER less than \u00a330,000. \nSensitivity analysis performed around the base case \nThe probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Table 3) indicates for every cohort group \nand at prevalence levels of 1% or less, the likelihood that any screening strategy \nwould be more cost-effective than current practice is small.  At 5% prevalence for \nthe 40 year-olds cohort level there is less than 50% likelihood that \u2018technician\u2019 \nscreening might be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay for a QALY \nof \u00a330,000.  Glaucoma optometrist screening is unlikely to be considered cost-\neffective. \nIncreasing the screening interval reduces the ICER for each age group and each \nprevalence level, as OAG on average, progresses relatively slowly and QALY \nreduction is more than compensated for by costs reduction. Varying the annual \nuptake rates for community optometrist testing led to both cost and QALYs \nrising as uptake increased. The higher the uptake, the better the current practice \nstrategy performs. The results of the sensitivity analysis on sensitivity and \nspecificity of the test following the measurement of IOP in the \u2018technician\u2019 \nstrategy indicate that the ICER is relatively insensitive to changes in these \nvariables.   \nTargeted sensitivity analyses \nFurther sensitivity analysis for a 40 year old cohort, ten year screening interval \nand a 5% OAG prevalence indicated that screening with the \u2018technician\u2019 strategy \n13 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nmight be considered worthwhile (see web site Table 4a). Probabilistic sensitivity \nanalysis demonstates that the uncertainty around model parameter estimates \nwas important, e.g.  even though the ICER for the comparison of the \u2018technician\u2019 \nwith the current practice strategy is \u00a320,571 there is only 42% likelihood that the \ncost per QALY would be less than \u00a320,000. \nFurthermore, sensitivity analyses on uptake of community optometrist testing \ndemonstrated that the QALY gain for the current practice strategy more than \ncompensates for its\u2019 higher cost.  The ICER of the \u2018technician\u2019 strategy compared \nwith current practice increased, as did the ICER for the comparison of the \n\u2018glaucoma optometrist\u2019 strategy compared with the \u2018technician\u2019 strategy. \nChanges to the rate of OAG incidence did not greatly alter cost-effectiveness, \nhowever, as the rate of progression increased (See web site Table 4.b \u2019high\u2019) then, \nthe likelihood that either screening strategies could be considered cost-effective \nincreased, as screening is likely to detect more cases and hence delay \nprogression.  Using alternative valuations for health utilities, varying the cost of \ndiagnosis by the ophthalmologist, the costs of treatment, inviting people to be \nscreened or their subsequent tests had little effect on cost-effectiveness.   \nThe threshold analysis for the cost of visual impairment and 1% OAG prevalence \nshows the \u2018technician\u2019 strategy dominates the current practice strategy when the \nannual cost for visual impairment is around \u00a316,000; moreover, the ICER is less \nthan \u00a330,000 if the cost of visual impairment is greater than \u00a38,800.  For the \n\u2018glaucoma optometrist\u2019 strategy to be considered cost-effective compared with \nthe \u2018technician\u2019 strategy would require the annual cost of visual impairment to be \ngreater than \u00a340,000. (see web site, Figure 2)  \n14 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \n \n4 Discussion \nWe conducted a model based cost-utility analysis of the screening for OAG that \ncompared technician or glaucoma optometrist based screening with current \npractice (e.g. opportunistic case finding). Data to populate this model came from \na series of systematic reviews of the literature and incorporated extensive \nsensitivity analyses to the imprecision surrounding parameter estimates and \nother forms of uncertainty.  The distributions used to characterise the statistical \nimprecision varied by parameter but were consistent with prior experience about \nwhich type of distribution would be appropriate for the type and nature of the \ndata available.(web site Iverson 1984, Philips 2004) Although, the best use was \nmade of, in some cases, limited data, further information on the value of almost \nall parameter estimates would be useful. \nOur study suggests that general population screening is unlikely to be cost-\neffective as the prevalence of OAG in the younger cohorts (estimated 0.9% at \naged 50), most likely to enjoy the benefits of screening for longer, is too low. \nHowever, screening might be cost-effective for selected \u2018at risk\u2019 sub-groups.  \nTargeted screening of 40 to 50 year-olds with a risk factor, (e.g. black ethnicity or \nthose with a family history of glaucoma), is more likely to be cost-effective \nassuming a prevalence of OAG between 3% to 4% and a screening interval of ten \nyears. These groups account for about 6% of the UK population. \nIn our model costs increase as prevalence increases because a larger proportion \nof individuals in the cohort incur the costs of diagnosis and the continuing costs \nof treating the OAG.  The mean cost per person and estimated QALYs are higher \n15 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nfor the 40 year-old cohort than the older cohorts because they are less likely to die \nduring the time horizon of the model.  Estimated mean QALYs fall as prevalence \nincreases because a greater proportion of the cohort experiences the adverse \nhealth effects of OAG.   \nThe model was sensitive to the annual costs for visual impairment (VI).  The \nhigher the annual cost of VI the more likely screening to become cost-effective. \nThe thresholds for this to happen are not dissimilar to the costs estimated by \nMeads and Hyde(17) (e.g. annual cost of VI of approximately \u00a37900 for the first \nyear and \u00a37700 for subsequent years).   \nThe more likely people are to have an eye test in the current practice strategy (i.e. \nthe comparator), the less likely screening is cost-effective. A relative high \nattendance for eye tests in the current practice setting might explain the \nsomewhat counterintuitive results.  \nA review of other cost effectiveness evaluations of screening for OAG (13) \nidentified only one previous study that attempted to compare an active screening \nstrategy with current practice (11).  This study also concluded that screening for \nOAG was not cost-effective.  However, a recently published cost-utility analysis \nof OAG screening in Finland (24) concluded that a screening programme could \nbe cost-effective, especially in older groups where prevalence rates are higher.  In \ncontrast to the Finnish analysis our model assumes that no one in the cohorts was \nreceiving treatment prior to screening or opportunistic case detection.  The net \neffect of relaxing this assumption is unclear. Stopping inappropriate glaucoma \ntreatment could make screening more cost-effective. However, care should be \ntaken to consider cost and consequences of those individuals identified as \n16 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \ninappropriately treated (e.g. raised IOP but no glaucomatous visual field loss). \nFurthermore, if individuals were treated appropriately, there would be no benefit \nfrom screening and its cost-effectiveness would be lower.  A further factor \ndriving the difference between the conclusions of the Finnish study and our work \nwas the inclusion by the Finnish study of the costs of visual impairment.  Our \nresults were also sensitive to the inclusion of these higher costs.   \nOne limitation of our study was that the utility associated with treated and \nuntreated glaucoma was assumed to be the same.  This ignores any utility loss \nassociated with adverse effects of treatment.  Adverse treatment effects are \nestimated to reduce quality of life by between 7 and 11% depending upon \nseverity of these effects, as estimated by Burr and colleagues (8). Future studies \nshould consider using a measure appropriate for use within an economic \nevaluation in people whose glaucoma has not progressed, both before and after \ntreatment has started.   \nThe systematic review identified insufficient evidence to meaningfully \ndistinguish between the variety of tests that might be used in practice.  This led \nto the simplification of the care pathways where the battery of tests used by a \nglaucoma optometrist was represented by a single value for sensitivity and \nspecificity of a test.  This and other simplifications (such as the small number of \nstages to represent disease progression) were made following consultation with \nexperts.  Further research to develop the model structure and the associated \nparameter values is required.   \nOverall, although the evidence on cost-effectiveness should be treated cautiously, \nthe results indicate some patient groups where the organisation of targeted \n17 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nscreening, i.e. a surveillance programme, might be given further consideration.  \nHowever care pathways would need to be in place for those not eligible for \nscreening.  In situations where it might be feasible to organise a service for the \ntarget population further primary research on the effectiveness and cost-\neffectiveness of such a programme is required. A randomised controlled trial is \nthe optimal study design  but prior to such a study being undertaken further \nresearch is needed to develop feasible strategies to identify individuals in \u2018at risk\u2019 \ngroups and the optimal configuration of screening strategies to maximise \nscreening attendance. \n \n5 Conclusion \nGeneral population screening is unlikely to be considered cost effective.  \nHowever, screening for OAG is associated with an ICER that society might be \nwilling to pay for particular cohorts of patients, namely, targeted screening for 50 \nyear-olds at high risk (e.g familiy history and\/or black ethnicity) may be \nworthwhile. Results are sensitive to the assumed annual cost of visual \nimpairment.  \nFurther data related to both improving the estimates available for some of the \nparameters in the model but also from a well designed controlled study \ncomparing viable screening strategies in the cohorts of patients for whom this \nresearch has indicated that screening might be potentially cost-effective, are \nrequired to confirm the findings. \n \n18 \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \u201cEconomic evaluation of screening for open angle glaucoma\u201d \nReferences \n \n 1  Organisation of services for diabetic retinopathy screening.
