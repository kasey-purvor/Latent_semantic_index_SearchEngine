In the Devonian (following collision of the Argentine Precordillera terrane to the 29 \nnorth), the site of magmatism jumped to the western and southwestern margins of the 30 \nNorth Patagonian Massif, although as yet the tectonics of this magmatic event are poorly 31 \n 2\nconstrained. This was followed by Early Carboniferous I-type granites representing a 32 \nsubduction-related magmatic arc and mid-Carboniferous S-type granites representing 33 \ncrustal anatexis. The disposition of these rocks implies that the North Patagonian Massif 34 \nwas in the upper plate, with northeasterly subduction beneath Gondwana prior to the 35 \ncollision of a southern landmass represented by the Deseado Massif and its probable 36 \nextension in southeastern Patagonia. This \u2018Deseado terrane\u2019 may have originally rifted off 37 \nfrom a similar position during the Cambrian episode. Intense metamorphism and granite 38 \nemplacement in the upper plate continued into the Early Permian.  Known aspects of Late 39 \nPalaeozoic sedimentation, metamorphism, and deformation in the Sierra de la Ventana and 40 \nadjacent Cape Fold Belt of South Africa are encompassed within this model.  It is also 41 \ncompatible with modern geophysical and palaeomagnetic data that do not support previous 42 \nhypotheses of southward-directed subduction and collision along the northern limit of 43 \nPatagonia. Subsequent Permian break-off of the subducted plate, perhaps with 44 \ndelamination of the lower part of the upper plate, allowed access of heat to the overlying 45 \nGondwana margin and resulted in voluminous and widespread silicic plutonism and 46 \nvolcanism throughout Permian and into Triassic times. Thus the new model addresses and 47 \nattempts to explain three long-standing geological enigmas \u2013 the origin of the Gondwanide 48 \nfold belts, the origin of Patagonia, and the cause of widespread Permian silicic magmatism 49 \n(Choiyoi province) in southern South America. Differing significantly from previous 50 \nmodels, it has new implications for the crustal structure, mineral resources, and the plant 51 \nand animal distribution in this part of Gondwana, since the southern landmass would have 52 \nhad an independent evolution throughout the Early Palaeozoic.  53 \n 54 \n 55 \nKeywords: Patagonia; Gondwana; Sierras Australes; Cape fold belt; continental collision; U\u2013Pb zircon. 56 \n 3\n 57 \n 4\n1. Introduction 58 \nPatagonia, conventionally considered as the continental region south of the Rio 59 \nColorado (Fig. 1), has long been recognized as differing from the rest of South America in 60 \nterms of its topography, environment, flora, fauna and palaeontological record. The idea 61 \nthat it could have had a separate geological history (Keidel, 1925) was stimulated by the 62 \nrecognition of terrane accretion processes in the early 1980s. Ramos (1984; 1986) 63 \nproposed that an allochthonous (exotic) Patagonian terrane collided with cratonic South 64 \nAmerica (supercontinental Gondwana) along the R\u00edo Colorado zone in Carboniferous 65 \ntimes. In his model, the suture (obscured by much younger sediments) formed by closure 66 \nof a previously intervening ocean, due to southwest-dipping subduction beneath the North 67 \nPatagonian Massif. In more recent reviews of the tectonic evolution of Patagonia, Ramos 68 \n(2002, 2004) has modified this idea to include a prior Early Palaeozoic collision within the 69 \nDeseado Massif, also thought to result from southward-direct subduction, prior to Late 70 \nPalaeozoic collision of the combined landmass so formed with cratonic South America, as 71 \nbefore. In partial support of these models, Devonian\u2013Carboniferous penetrative 72 \ndeformation, southward-verging folds and southward-directed thrusting of supracrustal 73 \nrocks of the northeastern North Patagonian Massif was described by Chernikoff and 74 \nCaminos (1996) and elaborated in a detailed structural study by von Gosen (2003), who 75 \nargued for Permian rather than Carboniferous crustal shortening, and possibly a 76 \nnortheastward-directed accretionary process. 77 \nFIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE 78 \nHowever, geophysical data (Chernikoff and Zappettini, 2004;  Kostadinoff et al., 79 \n2005) fails to reveal any significant crustal discontinuity beneath the R\u00edo Colorado basin, 80 \nand the physiographical boundary of Patagonia has been moved south to the line of the 81 \nHuincul fault, which in its eastern part follows the R\u00edo Negro. Nevertheless, Kostadinoff et 82 \n 5\nal. (2005) interpret gravimetric anomalies as indicating a basement of probable Early 83 \nPalaeozoic age extending yet farther to the south.  84 \nMoreover, plate subduction and collision should result in a recognized pattern of 85 \nrelated magmatism, metamorphism and crustal melting. The original allochthonous 86 \nPatagonia hypothesis suffered a set-back when it was shown that supposedly 87 \nCarboniferous granites in the North Patagonian Massif were in fact Permian to Triassic in 88 \nage (Pankhurst et al., 1992).  All existing collision models lack supporting magmatic 89 \nevidence for the postulated subduction and collision phases (i.e., subduction- and collision-90 \nrelated granite belts, and related metamorphism, of the right age and in the right 91 \nrelationship to the plate model).  92 \nWe present the results of extensive study over the past six years of the ages and 93 \ngeochemistry of igneous and metamorphic rocks that form the pre-Mesozoic basement in 94 \nPatagonia, and the provenance of some pre-Permian metasedimentary rocks. It must be 95 \nemphasized that these outcrops are very small (often only a few hundred metres in plan) 96 \nand sparsely distributed, due to the later extensive covering of Jurassic volcanic rocks, 97 \nCretaceous\u2013Quaternary sedimentary basins, and Tertiary basaltic lavas. Nevertheless, the 98 \nresults, when combined with existing constraints, suggest that the North Patagonian Massif 99 \nwas already part of Gondwana in Ordovician times. In contrast, southern Patagonia seems 100 \nto have belonged to an allochthonous entity that collided with the North Patagonian Massif 101 \nin mid-Carboniferous times as a result of north-easterly ocean-floor subduction. The 102 \nimplications and consequences of this model are reviewed, especially in relation the role of 103 \ncontinental collision in the formation of the Gondwana fold belts of South America, Africa 104 \nand West Antarctica, as well as the distribution of Early Palaeozoic faunal provinces. 105 \n 106 \n 6\n2. Analytical methods 107 \nThroughout this programme, we have dated the crystallization ages of zircon in 108 \nigneous and metamorphic rocks by U\u2013Pb geochronology using SHRIMP (Sensitive High-109 \nResolution Ion Microprobe) technology at The Australian National University, Canberra 110 \n(Williams, 1998). The relevant data, together with precise sample localities, are presented 111 \nas a Supplementary Appendix to this paper, and are summarised on a sketch map of 112 \nnorthern Patagonian (Fig. 2). In addition to dating metamorphic events by analysis of 113 \nmetamorphic overgrowths, where possible, the detrital zircons in metasedimentary rocks 114 \nhave been dated to provide information on provenance of the protoliths. We have also 115 \nundertaken whole-rock geochemistry (Table 1) and Sr-Nd isotope analysis (Table 2) in an 116 \nattempt to constrain the tectonic environment of magmatism. 117 \nFIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE 118 \nA parallel study using conventional U\u2013Pb zircon dating has been published recently 119 \nby Varela et al. (2005), in which earlier Rb\u2013Sr and K\u2013Ar are also reviewed (some of which 120 \nmust now be regarded as of dubious reliability in terms of crystallization age but, as 121 \npointed out by these authors, more probably relate to cooling and\/or metamorphic effects). 122 \nAs indicated by Varela et al. (2005), the main events in the evolution of Patagonia are of 123 \nPalaeozoic age, and metasedimentary rock units that can be ascribed to the latest 124 \nPrecambrian are mainly restricted to the northeastern North Patagonian Massif. 125 \nIn view of the wide time-span covered by the Palaeozoic evolution of Patagonia, it is 126 \nconvenient to present the new results and discuss them for each of the tectonic various 127 \nstages that we now recognise. The time-scale used is that of Gradstein et al. (2004) 128 \n3. Cambrian rifting 129 \nThe oldest stable area of continental basement in southern South America is the 130 \n2000\u20132200 Ma R\u00edo de la Plata craton (Santos et al., 2003). The Palaeozoic sedimentary 131 \n 7\nsequence of Sierra de la Ventana (also known as the Sierras Australes de Buenos Aires) 132 \ncrops out south of the proven extent of the craton, and rests on younger (Neoproterozoic) 133 \ncrystalline basement with crustal anatectic granite at 607 \uf0b1 5 Ma and I-\/A-type granites at 134 \n531 \uf0b1 4 and 524 \uf0b1 5 Ma (Rapela et al., 2003).  These igneous events correspond to the 135 \nBrasiliano\/Pampean orogenic cycles of South America farther north, and may now be 136 \nthought of in terms of the final assembly of Gondwana (Veevers, 2005).  The culminating 137 \nphase of igneous activity here is represented by Late Cambrian (~510 Ma) peralkaline 138 \nrhyolites that were derived from lithospheric mantle, and may be interpreted as recording 139 \nextensional tectonics related to rifting of this part of the Gondwana margin. Rapela et al. 140 \n(2003) suggested that this rifting episode resulted in the separation of a continental 141 \nfragment but could not specifically identify it within the present-day Pacific margin of 142 \nWest Antarctica, which is a collage of small crustal blocks (see Rapela et. al., 2003, figure 143 \n7). However, other authors agree that a Late Cambrian passive margin was established at 144 \nthe southern edge of Gondwana (as elsewhere, with reference to present-day geographical 145 \ncoordinates) along the span of the subsequent Gondwanide fold belt, e.g., Curtis (2001).  146 \nDalziel (1997) suggested that the rifted away portion was a large plateau area attached to 147 \nLaurentia and that this subsequently collided much farther to the north in the Ordovician, 148 \nleaving behind a fragment represented by the Argentine Precordillera. 149 \n4. Ordovician magmatism 150 \nIn northwest Argentina, the Early Cambrian Pampean orogenic belt lies to the west 151 \nof the Rio de La Plata craton, and was partially overprinted by the Early to Mid Ordovician 152 \nFamatinian magmatic arc (Pankhurst et al., 1998, 2000), with intensive deformation in the 153 \nLate Ordovician. The Famatinian belt has been considered as a continental marginal arc 154 \nrelated to subduction during the approach and collision of the Precordillera terrane. 155 \nHowever, recent geochronological and structural analysis suggests that Mesoproterozoic 156 \n 8\n\u2018Grenvillian\u2019 rocks exposed in the Western Sierras Pampeanas may have become part of 157 \nautochthonous Gondwana much earlier, being accreted to the R\u00edo de la Plata craton during 158 \nthe Pampean event (Escayola et al., 2005; Mulcahy et al. 2005; Rapela et al. 2005a). Such 159 \na continental basement, thinned during the Late Cambrian rifting, seems a likely candidate 160 \nfor the crust underlying the Sierra de la Ventana and, perhaps, the northwestern part of the 161 \nNorth Patagonian Massif (see below).  162 \nFIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE 163 \nPrevious geochronological evidence has been advanced for extension of the 164 \nFamatinian magmatic belt southeastwards through La Pampa province, as far as 165 \nChadileuv\u00fa just north of the R\u00edo Colorado and on to the Arroyo Salado area (Fig. 1) in the 166 \neastern part North Patagonian Massif (Tickyj et al., 1999; Varela et al., 1998). Our data 167 \nconfirm these results and establish the precise contemporaneity of magmatism in these 168 \nareas, yielding indistinguishable Early Ordovician U\u2013Pb SHRIMP ages of 474 \uf0b1 6 Ma and 169 \n475 \uf0b1 5 Ma for a (locally) early granodiorite and a late granite from Pichi Mahuida (Fig. 170 \n3a), 475 \uf0b1 6 and 476 \uf0b1 4 Ma for two granite bodies from the Arroyo Salado area, and 476 171 \n\uf0b1 6 Ma for granite at Sierra Grande 25km to the SW (Fig. 3b). Amphibolite-grade 172 \nmetamorphism associated with the Famatinian event in the North Patagonian Massif is 173 \nrecorded in quartzo-feldspathic gneiss from Mina Gonzalito (Fig. 4a), where new zircon 174 \ngrowth during amphibolite-grade metamorphism is dated at 472 \uf0b1 5 Ma (Pankhurst et al., 175 \n2001, recalculated).  176 \nFIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE 177 \nThese Ordovician granites of the North Patagonian Massif do not show signs of the 178 \ndeformation characteristic of the contemporaneous Famatinian granites of northwest 179 \nArgentina, but since the latter is thought to be a direct result of the collision of the 180 \nPrecordillera terrane, this would not be expected along the entire length of the magmatic 181 \n 9\nbelt, and there is no evidence for terrane collision at this time in the Patagonia region. 182 \nGeochemical and isotopic data (Tables 1, 2) show that these are equivalent to the igneous 183 \nintrusions in the main part of the Famatinian belt, which are almost entirely intermediate to 184 \nsilicic, metaluminous, with evolved initial 87Sr\/86Sr ratios (0.707-0.710) and \uf065Ndt values 185 \n(-2 to -6).  It is possible that the magmatism throughout the belt was initiated by post-186 \ncollisional lower crustal melting following the Pampean event, modified only in the 187 \nnorthern areas by further collisional compression.  188 \n5. Pre-Carboniferous sedimentation 189 \nThe country rocks of these granites in northeastern Patagonia consists of fine-grained 190 \nmeta-sandstones \u2013 the El Jag\u00fcelito and Nahuel Niyeu formations (see Fig. 2). Gonz\u00e1lez et 191 \nal. (2002) argue for Cambrian deposition of the former on the basis of its relationship to 192 \nthe granites and its trace fossil content. Detrital zircons from the El Jaguelito Formation 193 \n(Fig. 4a) have a youngest age peak at ~535 Ma consistent with this assignment: although 194 \nthis is strictly constraint on the maximum possible age, the dominance of this peak 195 \nsuggests erosion from a nearby active arc and in such cases it is commonly observed that 196 \nthe youngest detrital zircons effectively date deposition. That for the Nahuel Niyeu 197 \nFormation is slightly younger at ~515 Ma (both have a very few grains with even younger 198 \nages that probably reflect partial Pb-loss during Ordovician granite emplacement or 199 \ndeformation). The older provenance of both samples is typically Gondwanan with ages of 200 \n550\u2013750 Ma (Pampean and Brasiliano) and ~1000\u20131200 Ma (\u2018Grenvillian\u2019), as well as a 201 \nsmall component of older ages, including some at ~2200 Ma.  These patterns could relate 202 \nto major provenance from the areas immediately to the north in Early to Mid Cambrian 203 \ntimes, including the R\u00edo de la Plata craton (there is a very minor input of 2200-1900 Ma 204 \nzircons), whereas the \u2018Grenvillian\u2019 component is consistent with a local basement similar 205 \nto the Western Sierras Pampeanas as suggested above. The zircon cores from the Mina 206 \n 10\nGonzalito gneiss are similar, most notably in having their main provenance at 535\u2013540 Ma 207 \n(Fig. 4a), also suggesting Early Cambrian deposition and generation of the gneiss from the 208 \nsandstone protolith by Famatinian-age metamorphism. Thus the metapelitic rocks of the 209 \nnortheastern North Patagonian Massif appear to have been originally deposited as 210 \nsediments on a continental shelf at the southern margin of Gondwana. 211 \nFollowing intrusion of the Ordovician granites, the Sierra Grande sandstone-212 \nironstone formation was deposited in Silurian or Early Devonian times (Limarino et al., 213 \n1999), one of the very few such deposits known after the Precambrian era. Its probable 214 \ndepositional environment was a quiescent platform on a stable passive margin, with no 215 \nvolcanic input (Spalletti, 1993). The invertebrate marine fauna is of Malvinokaffric type, 216 \nsimilar to that found in the Falkland Islands. Palaeomagnetic data from this formation are 217 \nconsistent with Permian folding, but a prior pole position consistent with stable Gondwana 218 \nwas used to argue against it being part of a far-travelled exotic Patagonian terrane 219 \n(Rapalini, 1998). A sample of ferruginous sandstone from just outside the Sierra Grande 220 \nmine has a complex detrital zircon pattern (Fig. 4a) containing all the provenance elements 221 \nseen in the El Jag\u00fcelito and Nahuel Niyeu formations, as well as a youngest peak at ~500 222 \nMa. This suggests sediment derivation from the same source areas to the north, but after 223 \nthe eruption of the Late Cambrian rhyolites associated with rifting. One discordant grain 224 \nhas an apparent age of 470 Ma, but the general absence of Ordovician zircons suggests that 225 \nthe Famatinian granites were not exposed in the Silurian\/Early Devonian source areas. 226 \nThus one interpretation of the NE North Patagonian Massif is that it is underlain by 227 \nbasement rocks that were already part of the Gondwana continent by Cambrian times, 228 \nperhaps thinned during the Late Cambrian rifting event, and affected by Famatinian 229 \nplutonism in the Early Ordovician, then becoming a largely passive margin until post-Early 230 \nDevonian times. Its essential integrity with the Gondwana margin in the Early Palaeozoic 231 \n 11\nis consistent with the observation of Kostadinoff et al. (2005) that crustal magnetic 232 \nsignatures are continuous across the Huincul fault zone. 233 \n6. Devonian magmatism 234 \nFIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE 235 \nAfter the Ordovician, active magmatism reappeared at the western margin of the 236 \nNorth Patagonian Massif. Varela et al. (2005) have reported conventional 238U\u2013206Pb 237 \nzircon ages of 419 \u00b1 27 Ma (MSWD = 43) and 390.0 \u00b1 4.8 Ma (MSWD= 9) for tonalites 238 \nnear San Martin de los Andes (Fig. 2), and of 348 \u00b1 11 Ma (MSWD= 63, possibly 239 \nCarboniferous \u2013 see below) and 386.6 \u00b1 5.4 Ma (MSWD= 9.3) for deformed leucogranites 240 \ncutting schists about 50 km farther to the southwest. They ascribed these to a period of 241 \nDevonian magmatism and migmatization associated with the Chanic orogenic event 242 \nidentified in the areas north of Patagonia (San Rafael, Precordillera and Sierras Pampeanas 243 \n(Sims et al., 1998)). We have confirmed and refined the age of this magmatism in NW 244 \nPatagonia with U\u2013Pb zircon SHRIMP ages of 401 \uf0b1 3 Ma for the San Martin tonalite (Fig. 245 \n5a) and 395 \uf0b1 4 Ma for an undeformed granite at Lago Lolog about 10 km farther north 246 \n(Fig. 5b). Figure 5a also illustrates ages of 371 \uf0b1 4 Ma for megacrystic granite near Gastre 247 \nin the southwestern North Patagonian Massif and 394 \uf0b1 4 (recalculated from Pankhurst et 248 \nal., 2001) for a similar megacrystic granite at Col\u00e1n Conhue 300 km southeast of Bariloche 249 \n(Fig. 2) which, as suggested by Varela et al. (2005), may represent further extension of this 250 \nbelt. At this stage, the lack of geochemical data for this suite precludes assignment of the 251 \ntectonic environment of the magmatism for the porphyritic granites, but the San Martin 252 \ntonalite and Lago Lolog granite have initial \uf065Ndt values of about -4 and Sm\u2013Nd model 253 \nages of ~1400 Ma (in part recalculated from Varela et al., 2005, see Table 2), consistent 254 \nwith a Mesoproterozoic crustal component. If this belt, at least in its northwestern part, 255 \nrepresents a subduction-related arc in the west at this time, it further reinforces the 256 \n 12\nargument above that most of the North Patagonian Massif was autochthonous to 257 \nGondwana during the Early Palaeozoic. The jump in the magmatic arc position across the 258 \nNorth Patagonian Massif after mid-Ordovician times is presumably related in some way to 259 \nthe change of the regional tectonic scheme following collision of the Precordillera to the 260 \nnorth. 261 \n7. Carboniferous subduction 262 \nFIGURE 6 ABOUT HERE 263 \nI-type granitoids of Carboniferous to Permian age form the core of the Coastal 264 \nCordillera of Chile from 33\uf0b0 to 38\uf0b0S where they are seen in the Cordillera de Nahuelbuta 265 \n(Fig. 1). Southeasterly extension of this belt and its metamorphosed envelope has been 266 \nsuggested, as far as the Piedra Santa complex near the northwestern boundary of the North 267 \nPatagonian Massif (Franzese, 1995), but no supporting geochronology or geochemistry are 268 \navailable and until now it could not be traced any further. However, our results 269 \ndemonstrate the existence of a 120 km-long belt of Early Carboniferous I-type 270 \ngranodiorites in the eastern North Patagonian Massif, along the Cord\u00f3n del Serrucho, 271 \nbetween San Carlos de Bariloche and El Mait\u00e9n (41\uf0b0 to 42\uf0b015\u2019S) (Fig. 2). Two samples 272 \nyield well-defined Early Carboniferous (~Visean) crystallization ages of 323 \uf0b1 3 and 330 \uf0b1 273 \n4 Ma; a sample of the El Platero tonalite in the R\u00edo Chico, about 50 km to the southeast, 274 \ngave a comparable age of 329 \uf0b1 4 Ma (Fig. 6a). A two-point conventional 238U\u2013206Pb 275 \nzircon age of 321 \uf0b1 2 Ma has been independently reported for a sample from the same 276 \nlocality as MOS-043 (Varela et al., 2005).  All three samples analysed, which are 277 \nrepresentative of continuous outcrop, are foliated metaluminous hornblende-biotite 278 \ngranitoids with low abundances of lithophile trace elements, rare earth element (REE) 279 \npatterns typical of Andinotype calc-alkaline arc rocks, positive \uf065Ndt values (+0.1 to +2.8), 280 \nand low initial 87Sr\/86Sr (0.7034\u20130.7046) indicating a long-term light-REE depleted source 281 \n 13\nsuch as the upper mantle (Table 1). Other authors have previously suggested Carboniferous 282 \nmagmatism in the western areas of the North Patagonian Massif, but mostly on the basis of 283 \nimprecise Rb\u2013Sr whole-rock errorchrons or K\u2013Ar geochronological data (see Varela et al. 284 \n2005 for a summary).  285 \nTABLES 1 and 2 ABOUT HERE 286 \n8. Carboniferous collision-related magmatism 287 \nTwo previously undated granite bodies in the southwestern North Patagonian Massif 288 \nhave yielded mid-Carboniferous (Serpuhkovian\/Bashkirian) crystallization ages: 314 \uf0b1 2 289 \nMa from Paso del Sapo and  318 \uf0b1 2 Ma from Sierra de Pichi\u00f1anes (Figs 2, 6b). These are 290 \nboth peraluminous S-type garnet-bearing leucogranites with high SiO2 contents, strongly 291 \ndepleted heavy-REE patterns, high K2O\/Na2O ratios, unradiogenic \uf065Ndt values (-5.0 to 292 \n-6.0 on four samples) and relatively high initial 87Sr\/86Sr (0.7078\u20130.7098) indicative of 293 \ngeneration by upper crustal melting (Table 2). They have multistage Sm\u2013Nd model ages of 294 \n~1500 Ma that could represent the age of their deep crustal source region. 295 \nThese results show that in the southwestern part of the North Patagonian Massif a 296 \nshort-lived episode of subduction was followed by crustal anatexis during the mid-297 \nCarboniferous. The Cord\u00f3n del Serrucho runs approximately N\u2013S (Fig. 2), but the 298 \nequivalence of the El Platero tonalite suggests that the arc was orientated more NW\u2013SE, 299 \nand the S-type granites occur somewhat to the northeast of this trend line. Although the 300 \nwider distribution of I- and S-type granites in Patagonia is not clear, and the lack of 301 \noutcrops may unfortunately prevent further elucidation, both are typically emplaced in the 302 \noverriding plate above the subduction zone before and during plate collision, respectively 303 \nand their disposition thus strongly suggests subduction of an oceanic plate from the 304 \nsouthwest. 305 \n 14\n9. Deformation and metamorphism 306 \nThe folded Lower Palaeozoic sequences of Sierra de la Ventana, the Cape region of 307 \nSouth Africa, the Falkland Islands (in their pre-Jurassic position off the eastern Cape) and 308 \nthe Ellsworth Mountains of West Antarctica, consist of predominantly continental shelf 309 \ndeposits, commencing in the mid-Cambrian, with prominent Devonian quartzite horizons, 310 \nand with Early Carboniferous diamictites often interpreted as of glacial origin. In the Sierra 311 \nde la Ventana, deformation includes intense penetrative folding and cleavage and 312 \nsubsequent large-scale folding about approximately E\u2013W axes, together top-to-the-313 \nsouthwest thrusting. Prior assumptions of a Late Permian age for deformation in both the 314 \nSierra de la Ventana and the Cape fold belt has been dependant on older publications of K-315 \nAr data on illite and muscovite, together with the observation that the Permian strata at the 316 \ntop of the sequences have been deformed. However, there is notably less intense 317 \ndeformation in the Permian shales and sandstones at the top of the sequence, which were 318 \nremagnetized within the fold and thrust belt, compared with the Lower Permian part of the 319 \nsequence, which records stronger pre-folding magnetization northeastwards towards the 320 \nforeland (Tomezzoli, 2001). Schematic cross-sections drawn by von Gosen et al. (1991) 321 \nalso illustrate the more intense thrust deformation in the Curamalal and Ventana groups 322 \nbelow the level of an Early Permian unconformity. This was explained by proximity to the 323 \ninferred collision zone, but could alternatively indicate that deformation began before this 324 \ntime but continued through the deposition of the Permian-to-Triassic Pillahuinco Group. 325 \nThe general context of deformation is compressive, although in the Cape Fold Belt dextral 326 \ntranspression is important. If resulting from a continental collision to the south of this belt, 327 \nthe main collision must have occurred in mid-Carboniferous times, as originally postulated 328 \nby Ramos (1984; 1986), with less intense deformation continuing into the Permian. The 329 \ntiming of deformation of the Palaeozoic sedimentary series in the Cape Fold Belt, Falkland 330 \n 15\nIslands and Ellsworth Mountains is mostly considered to be Permian in age, but this is also 331 \nlargely based on K\u2013Ar dating of secondary mica in folded rocks, which can only be 332 \nregarded as a minimum. Deformation certainly affects the Permian strata, but there is no 333 \ntime constraint on when it began.  334 \nFIGURE 7 ABOUT HERE 335 \n Intense deformation following southward thrusting of the metasedimentary 336 \nbasement in the northwest part of the North Patagonian Massif has been ascribed to the 337 \nPermian (von Gosen, 2003). However, the main constraint for the timing of deformation 338 \nhere is the age of the Navarrette granodiorite which post-dates the thrust tectonics but was 339 \naffected by a late stage of NW\u2013SE compression. We present a U\u2013Pb zircon age of 281 \uf0b1 3 340 \nMa (15 points, MSWD= 2.3) which falls well within the Early Permian (Artinskian) and 341 \nrequires thrust tectonics to have been completed prior to this time (Fig. 7a). In the same 342 \narea, Basei et al. (2002) have reported a conventional U\u2013Pb zircon age of 300 \uf0b1 6 Ma for 343 \nthe Tardugno deformed granite, interpreted by von Gosen (2003) as a maximum age for 344 \nthrust tectonics. 345 \nCarboniferous (?) tectono-metamorphism occurred in the southern and western parts 346 \nof the North Patagonian Massif. Greenschist to lower amphibolite facies metamorphism 347 \nwas attained during peak deformation, forming extensive mylonite and ultramylonite 348 \nductile shear zones (Llamb\u00edas et al., 2002 and references therein). As noted above, the 349 \nigneous rocks of the Cordon del Serrucho are strongly foliated, and are associated with 350 \nsheared and mylonitic schists (Garc\u00eda-Sansegundo et al., 2005).  A sample of amphibolite-351 \ngrade paragneiss from south of El Mait\u00e9n has zircon with metamorphic overgrowths 352 \nrecording events at 330, 340 and 365 Ma, and zircon cores with a major provenance at 440 353 \nMa (Fig. 4b); it probably represents continental marginal sediments into which the 354 \nCarboniferous arc was emplaced. Medium-pressure, garnet-bearing metapelitic schists, 355 \n 16\ngneisses and migmatites of the Cushamen Formation at R\u00edo Chico (L\u00f3pez de Luchi and 356 \nCerredo, 1997), of which this is probably an equivalent, are intruded by leucogranites with 357 \nK\u2013Ar muscovite ages of ~280 Ma and have been proposed as higher-grade derivatives of 358 \nlow-grade schistose rocks at Esquel (Fig. 2) (Duhart et al., 2002). Other possibly pre-359 \nPermian gneisses and migmatites are found at R\u00edo Collon Cura, where Varela et al. (2005) 360 \nrecorded a U\u2013Pb age of 348 \uf0b1 11 Ma, see above, and at La Potranca, south of the R\u00edo 361 \nChubut, where altered orthopyroxene-garnet granulites host the S-type granite POT-316 362 \n(289 \u00b1 2 Ma, Fig. 7c).  363 \nIn contrast, the Tepuel basin in central-east Patagonia (Fig. 2, c. 43.5\u00b0S, 70.5\u00b0W) has 364 \na lower section of highly deformed but low-grade Early to mid-Carboniferous 365 \nmetasediments, dominated by diamictites and siliciclastic rocks for which glacial, epi-366 \nglacial and marine environments are documented (Limarino et al., 1999). The upper 367 \nsection, located in the western sector of the basin, is also folded and comprises a deltaic 368 \nsequence of conglomerates, sandstones and pelites carrying abundant Early Permian flora, 369 \nand also includes also restricted levels with marine invertebrates (our unpublished U\u2013Pb 370 \ndetrital zircon data are consistent with derivation predominantly from areas containing 371 \nSilurian igneous rocks, such as the Deseado Massif). 372 \n10. Permian magmatism 373 \nPermian (and Triassic) I-type magmatism is known from the La Esperanza area in 374 \nthe northern part of the North Patagonian Massif on the basis of Rb\u2013Sr whole-rock dating 375 \n(Pankhurst et al., 1992; Rapela et al., 1996), and recently from the western North 376 \nPatagonian Massif, where Varela et al. (2005) obtained 238U\u2013206Pb zircon ages of 272 \uf0b1 2 377 \nto 286 \uf0b1 13 Ma (albeit mostly with MSWD values of 18 to 76 that must cast some doubt 378 \non the accuracy of their error estimates).  379 \n 17\nOur U\u2013Pb SHRIMP results show that Early Permian granites are very extensive, in 380 \nboth time and space, occurring across the entire width of the massif (Figs 2, 7a). The oldest 381 \nconfirmed Permian intrusions, some of which show evidence of deformation, include the 382 \n\u2018Tunnel tonalite\u2019 at Rio Chico (295 \uf0b1 2 Ma, dated at 286 \uf0b1 13 Ma, MSWD= 39 by Varela 383 \net al. (2005)), the Laguna del Toro granodiorite near Gastre (294 \uf0b1 3 Ma, previously dated 384 \nas Carboniferous by Rapela et al., 1992), a weathered two-mica granite from Piedra de 385 \nAguila (290 \uf0b1 3 Ma), and leucogranite associated with migmatite at La Potranca, south of 386 \nthe R\u00edo Chubut  (289 \uf0b1 2 Ma). These may well have been generated during continued 387 \ndeformation. They are closely followed by the Navarrette granite (281 \uf0b1 3 Ma), and a 388 \nmuscovite migmatite west of Mamil Choique (281 \uf0b1 2 Ma). Many of these rocks, for 389 \nwhich disparate age estimates have been previously published, belong to what has been 390 \ndenominated the Mamil Choique or R\u00edo Chico complex, once supposedly Precambrian 391 \ncrystalline basement. Unlike the Carboniferous I-type granitoids, these characteristically 392 \ncontain zircon inherited from the older continental crust of Gondwana, as discrete grains or 393 \ncores of polyphase crystals. We have not made a systematic study of the inherited 394 \ncomponents, but they typically have ages of ~320 Ma, ~460 Ma, 500\u2013650 Ma and ~1000 395 \nMa, representing the younger part of the Gondwana spectrum, with pre-Carboniferous 396 \ncomponents essentially the same as in the Cambrian metasediments of the northeastern 397 \nNorth Patagonian Massif (Fig. 7a).  398 \nWe have re-dated samples of the granites and associated volcanic rocks from La 399 \nEsperanza in the northern North Patagonian Massif using the U\u2013Pb SHRIMP zircon 400 \nmethod (Fig. 7b). As is frequently observed, the U\u2013Pb ages are slightly older, but 401 \nconsistent with the previously published Rb\u2013Sr ages, with a total range of 246\u2013275 Ma. 402 \nFinally, An isolated outcrop of Permian granitoid from the southeastern North Patagonian 403 \nMassif, the Boca de la Zanja granodiorite from near Dolavon (Fig. 2), gave 257 \uf0b1 2 Ma. 404 \n 18\nThe younger age range for these rocks (mostly Mid to Late Permian) than for the western 405 \nand southern outcrops, suggest a northwesterly progression of magmatism during the 406 \nPermian.  407 \nThe composition of these Permian granitoids is quite variable (Figs 8, 9), including 408 \nrocks of both metaluminous I-type and peraluminous S-type affinities (60\u201378% SiO2), and 409 \n\uf065Ndt values range from \u20132 (Navarrette) to \u20136 (Mamil Choique), and even to \u201310 (for the 410 \nDonosa granite, La Esperanza, not dated in this study, but bracketed by the Prieto and 411 \nCalvo granites according to field relationships), equivalent to source model ages 1200\u2013412 \n1900 Ma. Their initial 87Sr\/86Sr ratios range from 0.7036 to 0.7119. Trends in the Sr-Nd 413 \nisotope diagram (Fig. 9) are distinct from that exhibited by the Ordovician granitoids and 414 \nthe Carboniferous S-type granites; whereas the latter show a shallow trend to higher initial 415 \n87Sr\/86Sr ratios, which is characteristic of upper crustal involvement, the Permian data 416 \nencompass a steeper decrease in \uf065Ndt values, especially in the Mid to Late Permian 417 \ngranites of La Esperanza, that is indicative of lower crustal components. The Permian 418 \nintrusions thus appear to represent a major hybrid magmatic episode involving melting 419 \nthroughout the crustal section.  420 \nFIGURES 8 and 9 ABOUT HERE 421 \nThe North Patagonian Massif is thus a major site of Permian granitoid magmatism in 422 \nsouthwest Gondwana. Emplacement began in earliest Permian times (c. 295 Ma), gradually 423 \nmoved towards the northwest during the Mid Permian, and reached a climax after the main 424 \ndeformation of the Sierra de la Ventana fold and thrust belt.  We attribute the more 425 \nvoluminous and widespread nature of this magmatism to major access of heat to the crust 426 \nfollowing break-off of the subducted slab after a continental collision that was initiated in 427 \nCarboniferous times. In principle it extends as far north as the rhyolite volcanism of Lihue 428 \nCalel in La Pampa province and Lopez Lecube syenite (258 \u00b1 2 Ma, Fig. 7) near the Sierra 429 \n 19\nde la Ventana (Fig. 1), where the alkaline character of the magmatism reflects its intraplate 430 \nposition, and continued into the Triassic (Rapela et al., 1996). These granites can be 431 \nidentified as the most important source so far recognised for the provenance of Permo-432 \nTriassic detritus in Late Palaeozoic sedimentary rocks along this part of the Pacific margin 433 \nof Gondwana (Herv\u00e9 et al., 2003).  434 \n11. Discussion: a new tectonic model  435 \nThe latest information on the history of magmatism, including all new data obtained 436 \nin this study, has been integrated with the sedimentary and tectonic record of the region 437 \nextending from the Gondwana margin of the Sierra Ventana to southernmost Patagonia in 438 \nFig. 10. In the remainder of this section we develop our interpretation of these data in 439 \nterms of the separate Early Palaeozoic evolution of southern Patagonia, largely represented 440 \nby the Deseado Massif, and its collision with Gondwana in the mid-Carboniferous. 441 \nFIGURE 10 ABOUT HERE 442 \nDu Toit (1937) was among the first to apply the idea of continental drift to global 443 \ntectonics. He recognized the essential continuity of stratigraphy and deformation in the 444 \nEarly Palaeozoic fold belts of Sierra de la Ventana in South America and the Cape region 445 \nof South Africa, defining his \u2018Samfrau Geosyncline\u2019. Prior to the dispersion of Gondwana 446 \nas separate continental fragments, these belts would have been contiguous and collinear, 447 \nand presumably extended to the Early Palaeozoic sequences of the Falkland Islands and the 448 \nEllsworth Mountains of West Antarctica. They share, at least in part, semi-continuous 449 \nsedimentation from Mid-Cambrian to Permian, and have several remarkable common 450 \nfeatures.   With the arrival of plate tectonic theory, modern explanations of these sequences 451 \nand their \u2018Gondwanide\u2019 deformation were sought, falling into two groups: those in which 452 \nfolding was ascribed to compression in a back-arc situation over a distant north-dipping 453 \nsubduction zone (Lock, 1980; Dalziel and Grunow, 1992; Trouw and de Wit 1999, Dalziel 454 \n 20\net al., 2000), and those invoking continent\u2013continent collision (Winter, 1984; Ramos, 455 \n1984; 1986). Cawood (2005) has proposed that this deformation represents the final stage 456 \nof a long-lived \u2018Terra Australis orogen\u2019, that began in the Neoproterozoic, was developed 457 \nalong the entire Gondwana margin of South America, East Antarctica, and southeast 458 \nAustralia, and that was primarily accretional in nature, although this would allow for the 459 \naccretion of small continental terrane fragment in certain places and at various times. Since 460 \nthe Cape Fold Belt faces the South Atlantic ocean, there is no remaining evidence of any 461 \npossible colliding continental mass, but the landmass of Patagonia lies to the south of the 462 \nSierra de la Ventana.  463 \nIn Figure 11, we have attempted to demonstrate a genetic connection between the 464 \nevidence presented above for Carboniferous\u2013Early Permian collision in Patagonia with the 465 \ndeformation of the Gondwanide fold belts. Continental plate reconstruction of the SW 466 \nmargin of pre-Mesozoic Gondwana is complicated by major changes during break-up in 467 \nJurassic and Cretaceous times. These include rotation and translation of fragments such as 468 \nthe Falkland Plateau (Taylor and Shaw, 1989) and southern Patagonia (Viz\u00e1n et al., 2005), 469 \nmovements on major dextral fault zones (Rapela and Pankhurst, 1992; Jacques, 2003), 470 \nopening of the San Jorge and Magellanes sedimentary basins during the Cretaceous 471 \n(Macdonald et al., 2003; Spalletti and Franzese, in press), growth of the westernmost areas 472 \nby accretion of smaller terranes (Forsythe and Mpodozis, 1979), and crustal extension 473 \nduring the emplacement of granitic batholiths (Rapela et al., 2005b). Nevertheless, most 474 \nrecent models, e.g., Ghidella et al. (2002), concur with respect to placing the Deseado 475 \nMassif much closer to the southern tip of South Africa and the northern tip of the Antarctic 476 \nPeninsula outboard of southernmost Patagonia. These factors have been incorporated as far 477 \nas possible into the schematic of Fig. 11.  478 \nFIGURE 11 ABOUT HERE 479 \n 21\nWe suggest that the geological data summarised in this paper for the tectonic 480 \nevolution Patagonia can be best explained by mid-Carboniferous collision on the southwest 481 \nside of the North Patagonian Massif, resulting from ocean closure by subduction towards 482 \nthe northeast beneath an autochthonous Gondwana that included at least the greater part of 483 \nthe North Patagonian Massif. The only possible colliding crustal block is southern 484 \nPatagonia, where the main exposure of Palaeozoic basement is the Deseado Massif (Fig. 485 \n11), which has a history of Neoproterozoic sedimentation and metamorphism followed by 486 \nSilurian and Devonian granite magmatism (Pankhurst et al., 2003). The strongest doubt 487 \nabout such a collision being the main cause of deformation of the Gondwana fold belts is 488 \nthe relatively small size of the exposed massif, but its subsurface extension to the southeast 489 \nis suggested by geophysical data showing the presence of an offshore basement high, the 490 \nRio Chico-Dungeness Arch (Biddle et al., 1986). Even in the most recent model of 491 \naccretionary rather collisional orogeny (Cawood, 2005), Patagonia is recognised as 492 \ndiffering in nature from other accreted areas of the Gondwana margin, being classified as a 493 \n\u2018peri-Gondwana continental assemblage\u2019. Moreover, other continental basement areas in 494 \nthe West Antarctic collage could have been involved at this stage, viz. the Antarctic 495 \nPeninsula, where the west coast shows evidence of Late Palaeozoic magmatic episodes 496 \nsuperimposed on older metasedimentary rocks (Millar et al., 2002). Ultimately, even if 497 \noverall plate kinematic readjustments Cawood (2005) were preferred in order to explain 498 \nGondwana-wide folding, our evidence and arguments would still suggest that southern 499 \nPatagonia, perhaps together with parts of West Antarctica, was continental crust to the 500 \nsouth of the major plate boundary, so that its annexation was nevertheless an essential 501 \nelement in the Gondwana orogeny. 502 \nThe suture zone would lie beneath the Mesozoic sediments of the San Jorge basin.  503 \nThe occurrence of a pre-collisional subduction-related arc and of post-collisional anatectic 504 \n 22\ngranites in the southwestern part of the North Patagonian Massif also indicate that this was 505 \nthe upper plate and that ocean floor was subducted northeastwards beneath this active 506 \nmargin. The southern continental block is thus presumed to have had a passive margin, on 507 \nwhich a foreland mid-Carboniferous\u2013Early Permian basin represented by the Tepuel Group 508 \nwas formed before, during and after collision. Deformation was transmitted to the 509 \nPalaeozoic sedimentary sequences of the Sierra de la Ventana, Cape region of South 510 \nAfrica, the Falkland Islands and the Ellsworth Mountains of West Antarctica as they were 511 \nforced up against the back-stop of the R\u00edo de La Plata and Kaapvaal cratons, and continued 512 \ninto Mid Permian times. These relationships are illustrated in the schematic cross-sections 513 \nof Fig. 12. 514 \nFIGURE 12 ABOUT HERE 515 \nIt is apparent that the colliding block could have consisted largely of continental 516 \ncrust that rifted off from the Gondwana margin in Cambrian times, and that was formerly 517 \npart of the Neoproterozoic precursor of Gondwana \u2013 in tectonic terms it could be described 518 \nas parautochthonous rather than allochthonous. This would be consistent with the 519 \noccurrence of Cambrian magmatism similar to that of the Sierra de la Ventana in both the 520 \nCape fold belt basement and beneath the Jurassic volcanic cover of Tierra del Fuego 521 \n(S\u00f6llner et al., 2000; Pankhurst et al., 2003).  Separation may not have been very great 522 \nduring the Cambrian\u2013Carboniferous interval, which would explain the very short period of 523 \nsubduction (no more than 20 m.y.) preceding collision. 524 \nLarge-scale crustal melting as a result of slab break-off was also the mechanism 525 \ninvoked by Mpodozis and Kay (1990) to explain the Permian Choiyoi magmatism, which 526 \nresulted in voluminous rhyolitic volcanic rocks and granites in the Frontal Cordillera and 527 \nthe San Rafael Massif, central western Argentina, 28-35\u00ba S. These extensive volcanic 528 \nsequences unconformably overlie marine and continental Carboniferous and Early Permian 529 \n 23\ndeposits (Caminos and Azcuy, 1996).  Mpodozis and Kay (1990) postulated collision of an 530 \nunidentified exotic terrane in the west (\u2018Terrane-X\u2019), immediately prior to slab break-off. 531 \nGeological evidence for this has never been established, although there is some evidence 532 \nhere also for Mid Carboniferous subduction-related magmatism, e.g., the Tabaquito pluton 533 \n(Llamb\u00edas and Sato, 1995) which is affected by pre-Permian fragile deformation. We 534 \nsuggest that an alternative to the Terrane-X hypothesis would be propagation of a 535 \nprogressive rupture in the slab (\u2018slap tear-off\u2019) initially induced by the relatively small-536 \nscale Patagonian collision proposed in this paper. Detailed chronology of the magmatism 537 \nof the Choiyoi volcanism that could provide support for this idea has yet to be carried out, 538 \nbut we note that the time-lag between the postulated collision at about 320 Ma and the start 539 \nof Permian magmatism is comparable to that of 20-30 m.y. observed in the Himalaya after 540 \ncollision between India and Asia (Kohn and Parkinson, 2002). 541 \n12. Consequences of the new model 542 \nIf the southern continental block represented by the Deseado Massif (etc.) was 543 \nseparated from SW Gondwana from Cambrian until Carboniferous times it could be 544 \nexpected to have a different early\/mid Palaeozoic crustal history and basement evolution. 545 \nThere are already some notable distinctions (Pankhurst et al., 2003, and Fig. 10): i.e., it 546 \nlacks Ordovician magmatism (although it was close to a source of Ordovician granite 547 \nboulders by Permian times) and instead was the site of emplacement of Silurian S-type 548 \ngranites, which are also apparent in the detrital zircons of the Tepuel basin (our  549 \nunpublished data).   550 \nIt is quite possible that Cambrian rifting south of the North Patagonian Massif 551 \noccurred along a pre-existing structural weakness, and thus the deep crustal structure of 552 \nPatagonia south of the San Jorge basin could differ in age and origin from that to the north 553 \nbeneath the North Patagonian Massif. The recent discovery of Au mineralization 554 \n 24\nassociated with crust-derived Jurassic rhyolites in the Deseado Massif has not so far been 555 \nrepeated in similar rhyolites that cover the North Patagonian Massif, possibly as a result of 556 \nits different deep geological composition. The flora and fauna developed during the 557 \nPalaeozoic could also have followed significantly different evolutionary paths, depending 558 \non the geographical and climatic separation of the two continental areas. The Silurian-559 \nDevonian fauna of Sierra Grande in northwestern Patagonia is of Malvinokaffric type, 560 \nsimilar to that in South Africa, the Falkland Islands and Sierra de la Ventana (M\u00fcller, 561 \n1964; Turner, 1980, Mance\u00f1ido and Damborenea, 1984), which would be easily explained 562 \nif this were part if the Gondwana margin at this time. 563 \nWe conclude that mid-Carboniferous collision between continental areas represented 564 \nby the Deseado and North Patagonian massifs was probably responsible for initial 565 \ndeformation of the Gondwanide fold belts, the effects of which lasted until the Mid 566 \nPermian. Early Permian slab-break-off resulted in voluminous granite magmatism. Further 567 \ntests for this model could come from examination of the few remaining unstudied pre-568 \nMesozoic rocks, from deep seismic evidence for the nature of the deep crust of  beneath 569 \nthe San Jorge basin, and further evaluation of the consequences of the model indicated 570 \nabove.  571 \nAcknowledgements. 572 \nThis research was started while RJP was employed by British Antarctic Survey.

The data (not corrected for common Pb content) are displayed in Tera-828 \nWasserburg diagrams with 68.4% confidence limit error ellipses. The calculated age is the 829 \nweighted mean of 207Pb-corrected 238U-206Pb ages for the white ellipses: light grey ellipses 830 \nare for spots assumed to have suffered Pb-loss, and the dark grey ellipses are for those 831 \nthought to contain a significant inherited component; n = number of points in age 832 \ncalculation\/total number of areas analysed, \uf0b1 2\uf073 errors, MSWD = Mean Square of 833 \nWeighted Deviates. The derived ages of granite intrusion in these two areas are 834 \nindistinguishable, and fall within the range of Famatinian granitoids in northwestern 835 \nArgentina. 836 \n 837 \nFigure 4. (a) U\u2013Pb zircon provenance age patterns for metasedimentary samples from NE 838 \nPatagonia (see Fig. 2). The curves in the main diagrams are relative probability trends 839 \n(Ludwig, 1999) based on the preferred age derived from individual measurements, which 840 \n 36\nare also shown as inset histograms. For ages less than 1000 Ma, the 238U-206Pb age is used 841 \nafter correction for initial common Pb using the 207Pb measurement; for ages of 1000 Ma 842 \nand more, the 204Pb-corrected 207Pb\/206Pb age is preferred. Representative portions of the 843 \ncathodo-luminescence for each sample are shown on the right, with individual spot ages. 844 \nThe Mina Gonzalito gneiss zircons have Ordovician high-grade overgrowths on complex 845 \nnuclei that have age patterns similar to the El Jag\u00fcelito Formation schist.

Geochemical variation plots for the Carboniferous and Permian granitoids 871 \nanalysed in this study, showing clear distinctions in petrogenesis. The Early Carboniferous 872 \npre-collisional group are I-type, with lithophile-element depleted signatures and primitive 873 \nisotopic compositions, indicating a juvenile subduction-related source. The mid-874 \nCarboniferous collisional granites are lithophile-element rich and isotopically evolved (S-875 \ntype), and have heavy REE depletion indicating anatexis at garnetiferous crustal depths. 876 \nThe widespread Permian, post-collisional granites are intermediate in composition, and 877 \nhave patterns compatible with variable hybridization of crust- and mantle-derived magmas. 878 \n 879 \nFigure 9. Sr\u2013Nd initial isotope composition plot for the Palaeozoic igneous rocks of 880 \nPatagonia, based on the data in Table 2. The Early Carboniferous granitoids have primitive 881 \ncompositions largely in the long-term lithophile-element depleted quadrant, consistent with 882 \na dominant mantle-derived input. All the other granitoids have evolved initial isotope 883 \ncompositions indicating crustal contributions. Whereas the Ordovician and Carboniferous 884 \nS-type granites  follow a shallow trend suggesting young upper crustal sources with high 885 \nRb\/Sr ratios, the Permian (and Triassic) granites are far more dispersed, with the steeper 886 \ntrend for La Esperanza granites in particular indicating older, low Rb\/Sr sources associated 887 \nwith deeper continental crust.
