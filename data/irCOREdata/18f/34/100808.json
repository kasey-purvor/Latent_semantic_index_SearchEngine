Barton\nWright Nuclear Structure Laboratory, Yale University, 272 Whitney Avenue, New Haven, Connecticut 06511\n~Received 2 June 1999; published 26 October 1999!\nThree new high-K multiquasiparticle intrinsic states, Kp5(291), Kp5301, and Kp5(341), have been\nassigned in 178W. The configurations of these states are based on ten, eight, and ten, unpaired nucleons,\nrespectively, and they represent the highest-seniority intrinsic K states observed to date. The g-ray intensity\nbranching ratios and associated ugK2gRu values have been used to contribute to the specifications of the\nunderlying single-particle configurations of the states. Configuration-constrained potential energy surface cal-\nculations indicate that the nucleus retains stably deformed axially symmetric shapes. This evidence, coupled\nwith the experimental g-ray decay rates, suggests that K remains a good quantum number in these highest-\nseniority intrinsic state configurations. The aligned angular momenta of the Kp5(291), Kp5301, and Kp\n5(341) bands are observed to be lower than those of the other eight quasiparticle, Kp5251 and Kp5282\nbands in 178W. These differences are interpreted as the effects of reduced pairing due to blocking by the\nconstituent particles. While the dynamic moments of inertia are similar, they remain substantially less than\nthose of a classical rigid rotor, apparently saturating at a value of about 56\\2 MeV21.\n@S0556-2813~99!03611-0#\nPACS number~s!: 27.70.1q, 21.10.Jx, 21.10.ReI. INTRODUCTION\nIt has long been established that the reduced moments of\ninertia observed for rotational bands in deformed nuclei are a\nconsequence of the nuclear pairing force @1\u20134#. This force is\nresponsible for coupling pairs of nucleons together in an\nanalogous manner to the paired electrons in the BCS theory\nof superconductors @5#. However, the analogy is restricted\nbecause nuclei are finite systems and the pairing correlations\ninvolve only a few particles. Recently, much evidence has\nbeen presented for the demise of nuclear pairing correlations\non the basis of increasing angular momentum @6#. In this\ncase the Coriolis force destroys the pairing correlations\ngradually ~unlike the first-order phase transitions observed in\nsuperconductors!. In contrast, the demise of pairing correla-\ntions based on the number of unpaired nucleons ~the senior-\nity of the state! is not so well established. As the nuclear\npairing force becomes quenched with increasing seniority,\nthe nuclear moment of inertia is observed @7# to increase\ntoward that of a classical rigid body, although shell effects\nmay be important @8#. The large number of high-K multiqua-\nsiparticle states identified in 178W @9,10# have offered a\nunique opportunity to study this effect and an extension of\n*Present address: Department of Physics, University of York,\nHeslington, York YO10 5DD, U.K.0556-2813\/99\/60~6!\/064301~11!\/$15.00 60 0643the available experimental information would be valuable.\nThe highest-K rotational band, prior to this experiment,\nwas the Kp5282 eight-quasiparticle band in 178W @9#.\nThere are, however, predictions @11# that higher-K states\nshould compete to form the yrast line in 178W. This paper\ndiscusses the search for higher-seniority states in 178W, the\nobservation of an eight-quasiparticle Kp5301 band, and\ncandidates for the ten-quasiparticle Kp5291 and Kp5341\nstates. It is significant that the Kp5301 and Kp5(341) con-\nfigurations do not include the alignable h9\/2 proton ~which\nhas been noted to mask alignment and moment-of-inertia\nchanges when it is a component of a multiquasiparticle con-\nfiguration @7#!, giving improved insight into the influence of\nseniority on moments of inertia.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nHigh-spin states were populated in 178W with the\n170Er(13C,5n) reaction. The 13C beam was supplied by the\n88-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Berkeley National Labo-\nratory and the data were recorded with the one hundred and\ntwo escape-suppressed germanium detectors of the GAMMA-\nSPHERE array @12#. The natural beam pulsing frequency of\n5.66 MHz resulted in a beam pulse every 177 ns. Energy and\nefficiency calibrations were obtained with 133Ba and 152Eu\nsources which were placed at the target position. Ta and Cu\nabsorbers of thickness \u20190.1 mm were used in front of the\u00a91999 The American Physical Society01-1\nD. M. CULLEN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 60 064301FIG. 1.

It should also be noted that the maximum input angular momentum of the reaction was about 40 \\ .germanium detectors to reduce the number of x rays being\ndetected.\nThe experiment was performed in two complementary\nparts. First, a thick target of 170Er ~enriched to 96.88%! with\nthickness 4.6 mg\/cm2 was used. This stopped most of the\nnuclear recoils in the focus of the array. A 0.25-pnA beam\nwith energy 86 MeV was used and a total of 9.731010 un-\npacked triple-coincident events were collected. The second\npart of the experiment utilized a thin target of 170Er ~en-\nriched to 96.88%! with a thickness of 0.6 mg\/cm2, in order\nto enhance the observation of the higher-spin states in 178W.\nA 5-pnA beam with energy 83 MeV was used with this tar-\nget and a total of 3.631010 unpacked triple-coincident events\nwere collected. The beam current was adjusted in both cases\nto limit the singles rate in the individual germanium detec-\ntors to 4\u20135 kHz, which resulted in an event rate of approxi-\nmately 15 kHz. The g-g coincidence timing window was\ndefined such that the maximum time difference between any\ntwo germanium detectors was 1 ms.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS\nThe partial level scheme for states above the K515 iso-\nmer at 3654 keV in 178W is shown in Fig. 1. The states with\nK<15 were also extended to higher spin. For example, two\nnew transitions ~1013 and 1037 keV! are assigned as the\n321\u2192301 and 341\u2192321 members of the ground-state\nband, respectively. The scheme was deduced from a variety\nof two-, three-, and four-dimensional histograms. The use of\none hundred and two escape-suppressed spectrometers06430yielded triple or higher-fold g-ray events. The time coinci-\ndence information, with respect to the beam pulsing of the\ncyclotron, enabled various delayed-early ~across isomer! his-\ntograms to be created. In particular, a delayed-early matrix\nwas constructed from gating on the delayed 763-, 389-, and\n373-keV transitions, which lie below the 220 ns Kp5251\nisomer, and selecting any prompt transitions (629 ns from\nthe primary beam pulse!, which were part of the same event.\nGates were placed in these histograms and the g-ray inten-\nsities and coincidence relationships were used to determine\nthe order of the g rays in the level scheme. These data were\nanalyzed using both the \u2018\u2018RADWARE\u2019\u2019 @13# and the \u2018\u2018UPAK\u2019\u2019\n@14# software packages. Tables I and II list the energies and\nintensities for the transitions in the Kp5151 band and those\nabove the Kp5251 state at 6571 keV, respectively. Figures\n2~a!\u20132~d! show selected spectra for the Kp5151,Kp\n5251,Kp5282, and Kp5301 bands in these data, respec-\ntively. In the analysis it was noted that the thin-target reac-\ntion data were useful in extending the level scheme to higher\nrotational frequencies using the four-dimensional histogram.\nThe multipolarities of the g rays were obtained from an\nangular correlation analysis using the method of directional\ncorrelation from oriented states ~DCO! @15#. The directional\ncorrelation ratios extracted from these matrices,\nRDCO5\nIg~forward!1Ig~backward!\nIg~90\u00b0 !\n, ~1!\nwere used to deduce the multipolarity of the g rays, except\nfor the weaker transitions.

The absolute intensity of the 931.2-keV transition is approximately\n1% of the 41\u219221, 351-keV transition in the ground-state band.\nBand, Kp Eg6DEg Ig6DIg RDCO Ii\np\u2192I fp\n251 287.860.1 1347642 0.1760.01 261\u2192251 M1\n251 357.260.1 1000611 1.0560.03 271\u2192261 M1\n251 394.360.1 589629 1.5260.06 281\u2192271 M1\n251 423.660.1 251656 2.1660.16 291\u2192281 M1\n251 449.360.1 282658 301\u2192291 M1\n251 473.460.1 116627 311\u2192301 M1\n251 496.160.1 106610 1.1260.05 321\u2192311 M1\n251 517.760.3 71616 331\u2192321 M1\n251 536.960.3 29611 341\u2192331 M1\n251 556.560.3 \u2014 351\u2192341 M1\n251 645.060.1 261617 1.2160.05 271\u2192251 E2\n251 751.260.2 37566 1.5360.17 281\u2192261 E2\n251 817.960.1 25465 1.0360.14 291\u2192271 E2\n251 873.260.2 22166 1.1060.09 301\u2192281 E2\n251 923.460.2 18265 311\u2192291 E2\n251 970.760.2 20566 0.7860.03 321\u2192301 E2\n251 1014.160.1 84610 331\u2192311 E2\n251 1055.560.3 91610 341\u2192321 E2\n251 1095.560.7 30610 1.2860.36 341\u2192321 E2\n281 327.760.1 198613 0.2060.05 292\u2192282 M1\n281 421.560.1 9563 302\u2192292 M1\n281 463.660.2 79621 312\u2192302 M1\n281 493.760.8 \u2014 322\u2192312 M1\n281 524.060.2 \u2014 332\u2192322 M1\n281 537.660.1 \u2014 342\u2192332 M1\n281 748.960.1 \u2014 302\u2192282 E2\n281 884.860.2 4569 312\u2192292 E2\n281 957.660.2 \u2014 322\u2192302 E2\n281 1017.760.7 \u2014 332\u2192312 E2\n281 1060.560.7 \u2014 342\u2192322 E2\n281 324.460.1 181612 0.6060.11 301\u2192292 E1\n281 864.460.1 15369 0.6860.13 292\u2192281 E1\n281 931.260.1 274620 0.6260.03 282\u2192271 E1\n(291) 757.260.2 7467 0.7560.24 (291)\u2192282 E1\n(291) 437.060.1 6466 (301)\u2192(291) M1\n(291) 464.060.1 2564 (311)\u2192(301) M1\n(291) 492.960.1 2964 (321)\u2192(311) M1\n(291) 483.960.2 1964 (331)\u2192(311) M1\n301 559.160.1 10068 1.0760.17 311\u2192301 M1\n301 572.460.1 5867 0.4860.10 321\u2192311 M1\n301 594.160.2 3365 1.1160.05 331\u2192321 M1\n301 765.860.1 4666 1.1060.20 301\u2192291 M1\n301 1132.060.5 561 (321)\u2192(301) E2\n301 1166.160.4 1062 (331)\u2192(311) E2\n301 1187.360.4 1161 301\u2192281 E2\n(341) 549.660.1 3565 (341)\u2192(331) M1\n(341) 621.760.1 3266 (351)\u2192(341) M1064301-4\nHIGH-K MULTIQUASIPARTICLE CONFIGURATIONS . . .

The lower-\nseniority states have been well studied recently in Ref. @10#.\nIn the present work all of the multiquasiparticle rotational\nbands with K>15 have been extended to higher rotational\nfrequencies ~see Fig. 1!. For example, the band built upon\nthe Kp5151 state has been extended from spin 25 to spin\n39. A g-ray spectrum of this band is shown in Fig. 2~a!. This\nextension of the band encompasses a band crossing and rep-\nresents the highest-K , highest-seniority band crossing, where\nthe entire alignment gain has been observed. In addition,\ncandidates for the first few states in the continuation of the\nlower-seniority band to rotational frequencies above the\ncrossing are also observed, as shown on the left-hand side of\nFig. 1.\nThe Kp5182, Kp5212, and Kp5222 bands have all\nbeen extended in this work to higher rotational frequencies.\nSome new transitions have also been observed which link\nthese bands to the lower-spin states and thereby remove am-\nbiguities in the previous configuration assignments @10#. For\nexample, in the Kp5182 band, the new observation of the\ntwo lowest E2 transitions in the band ~391 and 456 keV!\nallow the bandhead spin and parity to be firmly placed as\n182. Similarly, the observation of the 740 keV 232\u2192212\ntransition in the Kp5212 band is consistent with the 212\nbandhead spin and parity assignment.\nThe states in the Kp5251 band have been extended over\nthose established in Refs. @9,10# @see Figs. 1 and 2~b!#. A\nnew transition of 864 keV was observed to feed into this\nband at the 281 state, linking it to the 292 state in the Kp\n5282 band as discussed below. The states in the Kp5282\nband have been extended and reordered over those discussed\nin Refs. @9,10# above spin 30. A spectrum of this band is\nshown in Fig. 2~c!. The assignment of Kp5282 is confirmed\nby the multipolarity of the linking transitions from the DCO\nresults given in Table II. The 931-keV transition has a DCO\nratio of 0.6260.03, which is consistent with it being a pure\ndipole transition, and since it shows little mixing, it is likely\nto be an E1 transition. Similarly, the 864-keV linking tran-06430sition, discussed above, has a DCO ratio of 0.6860.13 and is\nalso assumed to be an E1 transition. A new intrinsic state\nwas also observed at an excitation energy of 8904 keV. This\nstate decays by a 757-keV transition to the Kp5282 band-\nhead state at 8147 keV. The large uncertainty, 32%, in the\nDCO ratio for this transition does not permit a definite mul-\ntipolarity to be established, hence a tentative assignment of\nKp5(291) is given in Fig. 1. The associated in-band E2\ntransitions were not observed and were reasoned to be below\nthe sensitivity of the present experiment.\nIn the analysis a new intrinsic state at an excitation energy\nof 8798 keV was observed. This state, assigned as Kp\n5301, is connected by a 324-keV transition to the 292 state\nin the known Kp5282 band, and by 766-keV and 1187-keV\ntransitions to the 291 and 281 states in the Kp5251 band,\nrespectively. The assignment of Kp5301 arises from the use\nof the DCO ratio of the 324-keV g-ray linking transition,\n0.6060.11, to deduce its E1 nature. The 766-keV g-ray\nlinking transition has a DCO ratio of 1.1060.20, which is\nconsistent with a mixed I\u2192I21, M1\/E2 assignment, albeit\nwith a large uncertainty. The spin and parity of this Kp\n5301 state are, however, firmly established due to the com-\nbination of the observed E1, M1, and E2 transitions. Any\nother assignment is much more unlikely based on transition\nrate arguments. For example, if the 1187-keV transition were\nM2 ~which would be K-forbidden!, then a measurable half-\nlife would be expected. Figure 2~d! shows a spectrum of the\nKp5301 band and from the inset it can be observed that the\nin-band E2 transitions are very weak. In addition, in coinci-\ndence with the highest-spin transitions in the band, a 550-\nkeV transition is observed to connect this band to a new state\nat an excitation energy of 11 073 keV @see Fig. 2~d!#. This\nnew state is a candidate for a Kp5(341) intrinsic state\nwhich would represent the highest-K , highest-seniority in-\ntrinsic state observed to date and is the first intrinsic state\nabove 10-MeV excitation energy to be observed in a well-\ndeformed nucleus. The 621-keV transition is tentatively as-1-5\nD. M. CULLEN et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 60 064301sumed to be the first member of the rotational band that is\nexpected be built upon this state.\nIV.

Quasiparticle calculations of energies and shapes\nIn order to estimate the validity of the proposed underly-\ning quasiparticle configurations of the high-K intrinsic states\nin 178W, the experimental excitation energies have been\ncompared with those predicted from theoretical calculations.\nThe theoretical values were calculated from potential energy\nsurfaces with the method of Xu et al. @17# for the specific\nconfigurations that are expected to be low in energy from the\nfixed-deformation calculations @11#. The shape calculations\nuse the Woods-Saxon potential and Lipkin-Nogami pairing.\nFor each quasiparticle configuration the occupied orbitals are\nfixed ~diabatic blocking! and the quadrupole and hexadeca-\npole deformations, b2 , b4, and g , are varied in order to\nminimize the excitation energy. The monopole pairing\nstrength is determined self-consistently, by fitting the odd-\neven mass differences, while allowing the different ground\nstates to have different shapes. Residual nucleon-nucleon in-\nteractions are not taken into account, but these do not affect\nthe calculated shapes.\nThe specific quasiparticle configurations are given in\nTable V, where the experimental and calculated bandhead\nenergies are compared. There has been no attempt to obtain\ndetailed energy fits. ~The calculations contain no adjustable\nparameters and no residual interactions.! Rather, the empha-\nsis has been on obtaining realistic, configuration-constrained\nshape parameters.

With the fixed-shape, Nilsson-\nplus-BCS calculations of Jain et al. @11# ~including residual\ninteractions!, the difference is even greater, 860 keV. There\nappears to be a limited predictive power for the calculation\nof excitation energies at very high seniority, and further\nwork is needed to understand the origin of the discrepancy.\nThe calculated shapes are also of interest. These are sen-\nsitive to the configurations, but not to the excitation energies\nas such. The Kp5251 state @17# has one of the largest b2\ndeformations ~0.261! in 178W, while the Kp5341 state is\npredicted to have the smallest b2 value ~0.215!. The princi-\npal difference lies in the change in orbital occupation, from\nthe prolate-driving 1\/22@541# proton orbital, to the oblate\ndriving 11\/22@505# proton orbital. Nevertheless, the shape\ndifference effect on the rigid-body moments of inertia would\nbe small ~less than 2%! and, for each configuration, axial\nsymmetry is preserved (g\u201900) indicating that the K quan-\ntum number should remain valid. The angular-momentum\nlimit to the K quantum number does not yet appear to have\nbeen reached. However, in the absence of sufficiently\nK-forbidden transitions to generate significant half-lives\nabove the Kp5251 isomer ~see the following section!, it is\nnot yet possible to test this aspect of the 178W shape calcu-\nlations for K.25.\nC. Half lives and transition rates\nThe lifetimes of the intrinsic states in 178W are expected\nto be strongly influenced by the K-selection rule.

This limit results\nfrom the fact that gates placed on transitions above the band-\nhead state are observed in prompt coincidence with those\nbelow the bandhead state in the thin target reaction data. If\nthe lifetime of the intrinsic state was longer than a few ns\nthen the nuclear recoils would decay after they had recoiled\nTABLE VI.

A centroid-shift analysis,\nsimilar to that performed in Ref. @10#, of the time difference\nbetween two germanium events, one gated above and the\nother gated below the state of interest, was also performed.\nHowever, the large volumes of the GAMMASPHERE detectors\nare not suited for measuring such short half lives (,1 ns)\nand consequently only upper limit half lives of ,1 ns could\nbe determined for the Kp5282, Kp5(291), Kp5301, and\nKp5(341) intrinsic states, respectively.\nIn order to discuss the implications of these lifetime limits\nof the intrinsic states, it is useful to consider the \u2018\u2018hindrance\nper degree of K forbiddenness\u2019\u2019 or reduced hindrance factors\nfor the decays. The reduced hindrance factor is defined as\nf n5$T1\/2g \/T1\/2W %1\/n, ~7!\nwhere T1\/2\ng is the partial g-ray half life, T1\/2\nW is the Weisskopf\nsingle-particle half-life estimate, and n is the degree of K\nforbiddenness, DK2l . In order to take account of the gen-\nerally observed strong E1 hindrance compared with the\nWeisskopf estimates @18,19# and, therefore, to allow com-\nparisons with the strength of other multipolarities, the\nE1 T1\/2\nW value is multiplied by 104 before f n is calculated.\nThe reduced hindrance limits for the transitions which decay\nfrom the Kp5282, Kp5(291), Kp5301, and Kp5(341)\nintrinsic states are shown in Table VII. Upper limits of f n\n<20 are determined. This may be compared with f n525 for\nthe E1 decay of the Kp5251, 220 ns isomer @10#.\nIn Ref. @10# the decay of the high-K states in 178W was\ndiscussed on the basis of the f n reduced hindrance values for\nthe transitions. It was reasoned that large f n values (.20)\nsignified that the g-ray intensity decay path would follow the\nK selection rule and transitions would decay via the route\nwith the minimum change in K. Under these circumstances,\nK was reasoned to be a good quantum number even at these\nhigh seniorities. However, when the f n values were small\n~,2!, then the decay path would proceed by the route with\nthe highest transition energy as was observed in, for ex-\nample, 176W @20#. In the intermediate region, 2, f n,20,\nmost of the decays proceed via the minimum changes in K,\nbut there are some competing branches, as was observed in,\nfor example, 174Hf @21#.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 60 064301Kp5282, Kp5(291), Kp5301, and Kp5(341) intrinsic\nstates all have upper limit f n values ,20 ~see Table VII!.\nThese decays may indeed be reasonably well retarded and\nthe K quantum number may remain a good quantum number,\neven up to states with a seniority of ten, however, improved\nhalf-life data are required in order to provide a critical evalu-\nation. Figure 4 shows that these Kp5282, Kp5(291), Kp\n5301, and Kp5(341) intrinsic states are all near yrast.\nD. Total aligned angular momentum, Ix,\nand pairing correlations\nThe Kp5301 state is the highest-K state, observed to\ndate, with more than one rotational transition which, there-\nfore, allows its dynamic moment of inertia to be extracted. It\nmight be intuitively expected that static pairing should be\ngreatly reduced for this band because there are four unpaired\nprotons and four unpaired neutrons. If pairing is greatly re-\nduced then the kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia,\nI(1) and I(2), should be equal. It has previously been ob-\nserved @9# that this is not the case for the eight-quasiparticle\nKp5251 band in 178W, where I(1).I(2) and this observa-\ntion is contrary to the idea of simple classical rigid body\nrotation with no contribution from single-particle alignments\n@6,22#.\nIn order to discuss these moments of inertia it is useful to\nuse the same representation employed by Purry et al. @9,10#\nFIG. 4.

The values, Ix , for\nthe Kp5151, Kp5251, Kp5282, Kp5301, and the\nground-state-band, Kp501, in 178W are shown in Fig. 5.\nThe \u2018\u2018apparent alignment\u2019\u2019 in this figure is obtained from the\nextrapolation of the rotational axis component of the angular\nmomentum, Ix , to zero rotational frequency. For the Kp\n5251 band it was previously noted @9# that the value at the\nintercept, measured in the present data to be 2.660.1\\ , was\nconsistent with the Coriolis effect on the aligned angular\nmomentum of the h9\/2 1\/22@541# proton in its eight-\nquasiparticle configuration. Calculations in Ref. @7# show\nthat the Coriolis effect and, therefore, the net alignment, for\nthe h9\/2 nucleon persists, despite reduced pairing. This is\nbecause the proton Fermi level is close to the V51\/22 or-\nbital, whereas, the i13\/2 neutron alignment drops because the\nneutron Fermi level is higher in the shell, between the V\n57\/21 and V59\/21 orbitals. In a similar manner the total\naligned angular momentum, Ix , at zero rotational frequency\nfor the Kp5282 band is 2.760.1\\ because its configuration\nalso contains the h9\/2 1\/22@541# proton. In contrast, the new\nKp5301 band shows a value of approximately zero (0.0\n60.1\\), which is consistent with it having no alignable\nhigh-j , low-V particles in its eight quasiparticle configura-\ntion. Indeed compared with the Kp5251 configuration, the\nconfiguration for this band has the 1\/22@541# proton re-\nplaced by the 11\/22@505# proton.\nFrom Fig. 5, the kinematic and dynamic moments of in-\nertia can easily be deduced by I(1)5\\Ix \/v and I(2)\n5\\dIx \/dv . These moments of inertia are shown for the\nKp5251, Kp5282, Kp5(291), Kp5301, and Kp\n5(341) bands in Table VIII. It can be observed that the\ndynamic moment of inertia for the Kp5251 band, I(2)\n551\\2 MeV21, is very much greater than that of the\nground-state band of 29\\2 MeV21. However, this still only\nrepresents 60% of the rigid-body value of 85\\2 MeV21\nshown by the full line in Fig. 5.

PHYSICAL REVIEW C 60 064301momentum beyond which no bands cross at low rotational\nfrequency @7#. These observations may be reconciled with\nthe fact that the ground-state band ~below the first band\ncrossing! has all particles fully paired and, therefore, the\nlowest moment of inertia. In contrast, the eight quasiparticle\nbands have eight unpaired particles, which are expected to\nlead to a substantial erosion of the nuclear pairing force\nand, therefore, a larger moment of inertia. One important\nfeature of this figure and Table VIII is that the Kp5301\nband is the only band which has equality in its dynamic and\nstatic moments of inertia, I(1)555.8\\2 and I(2)\n555.9\\2 MeV21. This is precisely the behavior that would\nbe expected for a rigid body. However, these values are still\nvery much less than the 85\\2 MeV21 rigid-body value. The\nKp5301 band, therefore, represents a better rotor than the\nKp5251 band, with no apparent alignment, but it still does\nnot show a fully rigid moment of inertia even with eight\nunpaired particles. This is consistent @7# with the substantial\npairing energy obtained in the Lipkin-Nogami calculations\n~see Sec. IV B! given in Table V, with Dn5599 keV and\nDp5707 keV.\nIn Ref. @7# Dracoulis et al., argued that if pairing correla-\ntions persist for these high-seniority states then, despite add-\ning nucleons ~not the h9\/2 proton!, the apparent alignment\ndecreases. The implication is that the fall in alignment,\ncaused by the reduction of pairing, is greater than the effect\nof an underlying increase in the collective moment of inertia\nwhich, when using the reference appropriate to the low-\nseniority states, would lead to an apparent increase in align-\nment. For these new data in the present work the alignments\nof the 10 quasiparticle Kp5(291) and Kp5(341) bands\ncan be compared with their respective underlying configura-\ntions, the Kp5301 and Kp5251 bands coupled to an addi-\ntional two neutrons (7\/22@503# ^ 1\/22@521#) in each case.\nThis comparison is shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the\nalignment indeed reduces for the Kp5(291) band compared\nwith the Kp5251 band, which seems to indicate that pairing\ncorrelations are still having an effect, at least at the eight-\nquasiparticle level. However, the alignment apparently does\nnot reduce in the Kp5(341) band ~for which there is only a\nsingle data point! compared with the Kp5301 band.\nOne interpretation of this is that the behavior of the Kp\n5(341) band is just that expected if the pairing is indeed\nalready quenched in the Kp5301 band, as implied by the\nTABLE VIII.

The further implication is that those moments of iner-\ntia ~close to 56\\2 MeV21) correspond to the underlying un-\npaired moment of inertia for 178W. The blocking of two\nextra neutrons to form the Kp5(341) configuration from the\nKp5301 configuration ~see Table V! can then have no ad-\nditional effect on the pairing and, therefore, on the apparent\nmoment of inertia. The absence in the present results of ro-\ntational transitions above the first member of the Kp\n5(341) band means, unfortunately, that the dynamic mo-\nment of inertia is not defined. A crucial test of this proposi-\ntion would be provided by such higher data points which, if\nthe proposition is valid, should define the same slope for the\nKp5(341) and Kp5301 bands in the Ix versus \\v curves\nof Fig. 5.\nAs stated previously, shell effects have been identified @8#\nas a mechanism which would produce moments of inertia\ndifferent from the classical rigid-body values, even when\npairing is quenched. Furthermore, zero-pairing tilted-axis-\ncranking calculations, of the type described by Frauendorf\n@23# have been carried out @24# for the Kp5301 band in\n178W. These calculations are successful in reproducing I(1)\n5I(2)556\\2 MeV21, and lend support to the interpretation\nproposed here.\nV. SUMMARY\nIn summary, three new high-K multiquasiparticle intrinsic\nstates, Kp5(291), Kp5301, and Kp5(341), based on ten,\neight, and ten, unpaired nucleons, respectively, have been\nassigned in 178W. Configuration-constrained potential en-\nergy surface calculations indicate that the nucleus retains sta-\nbly deformed axially symmetric shapes. This evidence,\ncoupled with the experimental g-ray decay rates, suggests\nthat K remains a good quantum number in these highest-\nseniority intrinsic state configurations. The aligned angular\nmomenta of the Kp5(291), Kp5301, and Kp5(341)\nbands are observed to be lower than those of the other eight\nquasiparticle, Kp5251 and Kp5282 bands in 178W. These\nproperties have been interpreted as evidence for the quench-\ning of pairing and imply a saturation of the low-frequency,\nhigh-seniority moments of inertia for 178W at a value of\n56\\2 MeV21.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank D.C.
