A near consensus complex social \nnetwork is a social network with nontrivial topological features \nand steady state values of the decision certitudes of the majority \nof the nodes being either higher or lower than a threshold value. \nBy using eigen theories, the relationships among the vectors \nrepresenting the steady state values of the decision certitudes of \nthe nodes, the influence weight matrix and the set of vectors \nrepresenting the initial state values of the decision certitudes of \nthe nodes that satisfies a given near consensus specification are \ncharacterized. \nI. INTRODUCTION \nA complex network is a network with nontrivial \ntopological features. Complex networks appear in various \ncontexts in our daily life. Over the last decade, complex \nnetworks have drawn the attention of many researchers from \ndifferent fields of physical and social sciences, such as \nmathematics, computer science, engineering, biology, \neconomics and social sciences. A social network is a network \nmade of individuals, called nodes, which interact with each \nother. As many social networks have nontrivial topological \nfeatures, social networks are actually complex networks. \nIn the past, complex social networks were investigated \nusing lattice and graph theory [1]. Existing studies assume that \nthe complex social networks satisfy an exact consensus \nproperty (i.e., the steady state values of the decision certitudes \nof the nodes are all equal to either 1 or -1 [2]). Because of this \nstrong property, the complex social networks have to contain \nspanning trees [4], [5]. In reality, the steady state values of the \ndecision certitudes of the majority of the nodes are either \nhigher or lower than a threshold value [3]. Some complex \nsocial networks do not contain the spanning trees [4], [5]. \nThus, it is useful to extend the definition of the exact \nconsensus property to that of a near consensus property so that \nthe conditions on containing the spanning trees are relaxed. In \nthis paper, the near consensus property is referred to the \nproperty that the steady state values of the decision certitudes \nof the majority of the nodes are either higher or lower than a \nthreshold value. Deriving the near consensus property is a key \nto the analysis of practical social networks [3]. However, by \nextending the definition to the near consensus property, the \nrelationships among the vectors representing the steady state \nvalues of the decision certitudes of the nodes, the influence \nweight matrix and the set of vectors representing the initial \nstate values of the decision certitudes of the nodes that \nsatisfies a given near consensus specification are unknown. \nThe aim of this paper is to address the above issues. \nNote that this investigation is challenging as the set of \nvectors representing the steady state values of the decision \ncertitudes of the nodes that satisfies a given near consensus \nspecification is nonconvex. So far, no results have been \nreported on the near consensus complex social networks. \nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. A model of \ncomplex social networks and eigen theories are reviewed in \nSection II and Section III, respectively. In Section IV, a near \nconsensus complex social network is defined. By using eigen \ntheories, the relationships between the vectors representing the \nsteady state values of the decision certitudes of the nodes, the \ninfluence weight matrix and the set of vectors representing the \ninitial state values of the decision certitudes of the nodes that \nsatisfies a given near consensus specification are \ncharacterized. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section V. \nII. REVIEW ON A MODEL OF COMPLEX SOCIAL \nNETWORKS  \nLet N  be the total number of nodes of a complex social \nnetwork. Denote \uf028 \uf029kxn  as the decision certitude of the n\nth \nnode of the complex social network at the time index k , \nwhere 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Nn \uf04c  and 0\uf0b3k . Here, when \u201c \uf028 \uf029kxn  is close \nto 1\uf02d \u201d, the decision of the n th node at the time index k  tends \nto vote against a given proposal, while when \u201c \uf028 \uf029kxn  is close to \n1\u201d, the decision of the n th node at the time index k  tends to \nvote for the given proposal. Let \nnmw ,  for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Nm \uf04c  and \nfor 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Nn \uf04c  be the influence weight factor between the \nnode m  and the node n . Then, we have \nThis  paper is supported by an Australia research grant \nfrom Australia Research Council. \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf0e5\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf03d\uf02b\n1\n0\n,1\nN\nm\nmmnn kxwkx  for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Nn \uf04c  and for 0\uf0b3k . \nDenote \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05dTN kxkxk 10 \uf02d\uf0ba \uf04cx  for 0\uf0b3k  as the vector \nrepresenting the decision certitudes of the nodes at the time \nindex k  and \n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0ba\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02d\n1,10,1\n1,00,0\nNNN\nN\nww\nww\n\uf04c\n\uf04d\uf04f\uf04d\n\uf04c\nW  as the influence \nweight matrix, where the superscript T  denotes the transpose \noperator. Then, the dynamics of the complex social network \ncan be written in a matrix form as \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kk Wxx \uf03d\uf02b1  for 0\uf0b3k . \nDefinition 1. A complex social network is said to achieve an \nexact consensus property if there exists a 00 \uf0b3k  such that \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 110 \uf03d\uf03d\uf03d \uf02d kxkx N\uf04c  or \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 110 \uf02d\uf03d\uf03d\uf03d \uf02d kxkx N\uf04c  for 0kk \uf0b3 . \nIf a complex social network achieves the exact consensus \nproperty, then the decision certitudes of the nodes are all \nequal and all the nodes have 100% decision certitudes. \nHowever, in practical situations it is difficult to get all the \nnodes having the same decision certitudes. Even though all the \nnodes have the same decision certitudes, it is difficult to get \nthe 100% decision certitudes. \nIII. REVIEW ON EIGEN THEORIES FOR EXACT CONSENSUS \nCOMPLEX SOCIAL NETWORKS \nFrom a complex social network viewpoint, the decision \ncertitudes of the nodes have to converge. Also, the steady state \nvalues of the decision certitudes of the nodes could not be all \nequal to zero. Otherwise, a final conclusion on a given \nproposal cannot be drawn. If the complex social networks \nachieve the exact consensus property, then the steady state \nvalues of the decision certitudes of the nodes have to be all \nequal and the steady state values are either 1 or -1. Define \n\uf05b \uf05dT11 \uf04c\uf0ba\u03b9 . In order words, the vector representing the \ndecision certitudes of the nodes have to converge to either \u03b9  \nor \u03b9\uf02d . However, in general the model of complex social \nnetworks discussed in Section II does not guarantee the \nsatisfaction of this property. It is important to characterize the \nconditions on the influence weight matrix and the set of \nvectors representing the initial state values of the decision \ncertitudes of the nodes so that the above property is satisfied. \nTo address this problem, eigen theories are applied. \nLemma 1. Let \nn\u03be  be the eigenvectors of W  corresponding to \nthe eigenvalues \nn\uf06c  for 1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf03d Nn \uf04c . Then, \uf028 \uf029kx  converges \nto a nonzero fixed vector for each \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d0x \\0 N\uf0c2\uf0ce , where N\uf0c2  \ndenotes the N -dimensional Euclidean space, if and only if \nthere is at least one eigenvalue equal to 1 and all other \neigenvalues are always having modulus less than 1. \nLemma 1 states that the necessary and sufficient \nconditions for the vectors representing the decision certitudes \nof the nodes to converge to a nonzero fixed vector for each \nnonzero initial condition are that there is at least one \neigenvalue equal to 1 and all other eigenvalues are always \nhaving modulus less than 1. \nLemma 2. Suppose that \uf028 \uf029kx  converges to a nonzero fixed \nvector for each \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d0x \\0 N\uf0c2\uf0ce . Denote \uf028 \uf029k\nk\nxx\n\uf02b\uf0a5\uf0ae\n\uf02a \uf0ba lim . Denote \n\uf028 \uf02910 ,, \uf02d\uf0ba Ndiag \uf06c\uf06c \uf04cD  and \uf05b \uf05d10 \uf02d\uf0ba N\u03be\u03beT \uf04c . Assume that W  is \ndiagonalizable, that is 1\uf02d\uf03d TDTW . Let the first r  columns of \nT  be the first r  eigenvectors of W  corresponding to the \neigenvalues equal to 1. Define \uf05b \uf05d10 \uf02d\uf0ba r\u03be\u03beV \uf04c , \n\uf05b \uf05d1\uf02d\uf0ba\uf0a2 Nr \u03be\u03beV \uf04c  and \uf028 \uf0290~ 1xT\na\na\na \uf02d\uf0ba\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0a2\n\uf0ba , where \nrC\uf0cea  and \nrNC \uf02d\uf0ce\uf0a2a . Here, rC  denotes the set of all r -dimensional \ncomplex-valued vectors. Then, Vax \uf03d\uf02a . Furthermore, \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf02a\n\uf02b\uf0a5\uf0ae\n\uf03d xxW 0lim k\nk\n for each \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b aVxx \uf0a2\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf02b\uf0ce \uf02a0 , where \uf07drNC \uf02d\uf0ce\uf0a2\uf0a2a . \nLemma 2 reveals that, for a given \uf028 \uf029 0x \uf0b90  and a \ndiagonalizable W , if \uf028 \uf029kx  converges to 0x \uf0b9\uf02a , then \uf02ax  is \nuniquely defined by \uf028 \uf0290x  and W , in which the relationship is \ngoverned by \uf05b \uf05d\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029011 1xT0VVax \uf02d\uf02a \uf03d\uf03d \uf04cdiag . In other \nwords, the vector representing the steady state values of the \ndecision certitudes of the nodes can only be expressed as a \nlinear combination of the eigenvectors of the influence matrix \ncorresponding to the eigenvalues equal to one. As \n\uf028 \uf02901xT\na\na \uf02d\uf03d\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf0a2\n, the vector consisting of the linear combination \ncoefficients (the vector a ) is clearly dependent on the initial \ncondition. If a complex social network achieves the exact \nconsensus property, then \uf05b \uf05d\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029 \u03b9xT0Vx \uf03d\uf03d \uf02d\uf02a 011 1\uf04cdiag  \nor \uf05b \uf05d\uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d \uf028 \uf029 \u03b9xT0Vx \uf02d\uf03d\uf03d \uf02d\uf02a 011 1\uf04cdiag . In other words, if a \ncomplex social network achieves the exact consensus \nproperty, then \u03b9  or \u03b9\uf02d  can only be expressed as a linear \ncombination of the eigenvectors of the influence matrix \ncorresponding to the eigenvalues equal to one and the vector \nconsisting of the linear combination coefficients is dependent \non the initial condition. On the other hand, for a given 0x \uf0b9\uf02a  \nand a diagonalizable W , \uf028 \uf0290x  is not uniquely defined. Let \n\uf07b \uf07d1,, \uf02dNrS \u03be\u03be \uf04c\n be the subspace spanned by the set of vectors \n\uf07b \uf07d1,, \uf02dNr \u03be\u03be \uf04c , and let \uf07b \uf07d\n\uf02a\n\uf02d\nx\n\u03be\u03be 1,, Nr\nS \uf04c  be the linear translation of \n\uf07b \uf07d1,, \uf02dNrS \u03be\u03be \uf04c\n by the vector \uf02ax . \uf07b \uf07d\n\uf02a\n\uf02d\nx\n\u03be\u03be 1,, Nr\nS \uf04c  is called a linear variety \nof \uf07b \uf07d1,, \uf02dNrS \u03be\u03be \uf04c . Obviously, \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b aVxx \u03be\u03be \uf0a2\uf0a2\uf0a2\uf02b\uf03d \uf02a\n\uf02a\n\uf02d1,, Nr\nS \uf04c , where \n\uf07drNC \uf02d\uf0ce\uf0a2\uf0a2a , and we have \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d\n\uf02a\n\uf02d\n\uf0ce x \u03be\u03bex 1,,0 NrS \uf04c . In other words, a \ncondition for the vector representing the decision certitudes of \nthe nodes to converge to a given vector \uf02ax  is that the vector \nrepresenting the initial state values of the decision certitudes \nof the nodes have to be in the linear translated subspace \nspanned by the set of eigenvectors of the influence matrix \ncorresponding to the eigenvalues NOT equal to one and the \nlinear translation is exactly represented by the vector \uf02ax . If \nthe complex social networks achieve the exact consensus \nproperty, then \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d \uf07b \uf07d\u03b9 \u03be\u03be\u03b9 \u03be\u03bex \uf02d \uf02d\uf02d\uf0ce 11 ,,,,0 NrNr SS \uf04c\uf04c \uf055 . In other words, if a \ncomplex social network achieves the exact consensus \nproperty, then the vector representing the initial state values \nof the decision certitudes of the nodes have to be in the union \nof two linear translated subspaces spanned by the set of \neigenvectors of the influence matrix corresponding to the \neigenvalues NOT equal to one and the linear translations are \nexactly represented by the vector \u03b9  and \u03b9\uf02d . \nFor the completeness, it is worth noting that exist works on \ncomplex social networks usually assume the following \ncondition: 1\n1\n0\n, \uf03d\uf0e5\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nN\nn\nnmw  for each \uf07b \uf07d1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf0ce Nm \uf04c . A necessary \ncondition between the eigenvectors of W  and the above \ncondition is summarized in the following lemma. \nLemma 3. Suppose that W  is diagonalizable. Assume that \nthere exists a \uf07b \uf07d1,,0 \uf02d\uf0ce Nj \uf04c  such that \u03b9\u03be \uf0b1\uf03dj  corresponding \nto 1\uf03dj\uf06c . Then, 1\n1\n0\n, \uf03d\uf0e5\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nN\nn\nnmw  for each \uf07b \uf07d1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf0ce Nm \uf04c . \nIt is worth noting that this condition is not a necessary and \nsufficient condition for complex social networks to achieve \nthe exact consensus property. Even though Lemma 3 is \nsatisfied, the decision certitudes of the nodes could diverge. In \nthis case, the complex social networks do not achieve the \nexact consensus property. \nIV. NEAR CONSENSUS COMPLEX SOCIAL NETWORKS  \nNow, the exact consensus property of complex social \nnetworks is extended to a near consensus property. \nDefinition 2. Let \uf02a\nix  be the ( 1)\nsti \uf02b  element of \uf02ax , where \n1,,0 \uf02d\uf03d Ni \uf04c . For a given threshold value of 10 \uf0a3\uf0a3\uf064 , if \nthere exist \n1,k 10 ,k N\uf0a3 \uf0a3  different values of \uf07b \uf07d1,,0 \uf02d\uf0ce Ni \uf04c  \nsuch that \uf064\uf02d\uf0b3\uf0b3 \uf02a 11 ix , or alternatively, if there exist 1,k  \n10 ,k N\uf0a3 \uf0a3  different values of \uf07b \uf07d1,,0 \uf02d\uf0ce Ni \uf04c  such that \n11 \uf02d\uf0b3\uf0b3\uf02d \uf02aix\uf064 , then the complex social network is said to \nachieve a Nk1  near consensus property with the threshold \nvalue of \uf064\uf02d1 . Let \n1,k\nX \uf064  be the set consisting of all such \n\uf02ax . \nNk1  is the percentage of the total number of nodes that \nthe steady state values of the decision certitudes of these nodes \nare either between \uf064\uf02d1  and 1 or between -1 and 1\uf02d\uf064 . \nDifferent complex social networks have different minimum \npercentage of the total number of nodes to pass or to deny a \ngiven proposal. The value of \n1k  should be set accordingly. \nAlso, different complex social networks require different \nthreshold values on the steady state values of the decision \ncertitudes of the nodes to vote for or against the given \nproposal. The threshold value of \uf064  should be set accordingly. \nFor example, if a complex social network requires at least \n70% of the total number of nodes to pass or to deny a given \nproposal and each node is required having at least over 90% of \nthe steady state value of its decision certitude to vote for or \nagainst the given proposal, then 7.01 \uf03dNk  and 1.0\uf03d\uf064 . \nObviously, if 0\uf03d\uf064  and Nk \uf03d1 , then the near consensus \nproperty reduces to the exact consensus property. Note that \n1,k\nX\uf064  is, in general, nonconvex. \nAs most complex social networks are scale free networks,  \nwe consider scale free complex social networks in this paper. \nLemma 4. Suppose that there are n  hubs with high \nconnectivity. Assume, without loss of generality, that these n  \nhubs are located at the first n  nodes of the complex social \nnetwork. Also, assume that the decisions of these n  hubs are \ninfluenced by each other only, but not by the other nodes (i.e., \n0, \uf03dmiw  for each \uf07b \uf07d1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf0ce ni \uf04c  and for each \n\uf07b \uf07d1,,1, \uf02d\uf02b\uf0ce Nnnm \uf04c ). Moreover, the decisions of the \nfollowing k  nodes are influenced by these n  hubs and these \nk  nodes themselves, but not by the other nodes.

This is important, because \nthe dimensions of \nAW , BW  and CW  are much lower than that \nof W , and scale free networks usually consist of many nodes. \nThe set of eigenvalues of W  is the union of the sets of \neigenvalues of \nAW , BW  and CW  only. According to Lemma \n1, \uf028 \uf029kx  converges to a nonzero fixed vector for each \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d0x \\0 N\uf0c2\uf0ce  if and only if there is at least one eigenvalue in \nthe set \uf07b \uf07d\n10100\n,,,,,,,,\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d\uf02d nkknN AABBCC\n\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c \uf04c\uf04c\uf04c  equal to 1 and \nall other eigenvalues are always having modulus less than 1. \nBy combining the results in Lemma 2 and Lemma 4, we \nobtain the relationships between the vectors representing the \nsteady state values of the decision certitudes of the nodes and \nthe influence weight matrix of a near consensus complex \nsocial network. Re-arrange the columns in T\uf0a2  and the \ncorresponding diagonal elements in D\uf0a2  to give, respectively, a \nnew matrix T  and a new matrix D  such that the first r  \ncolumns of T  are the first r  eigenvectors of W  \ncorresponding to the eigenvalues which are equal to 1. Then, \nthe vectors representing the steady state values of the decision \ncertitudes of the nodes are a linear combination of the first r  \neigenvectors of W  corresponding to the eigenvalues equal to \none. The corresponding linear combination coefficients are \ndependent on the initial condition. \nCorollary 1. If the steady state values of the decision \ncertitudes of some of these n  hubs are nonzero, then there \nexist an \uf07b \uf07d1,,1,0 \uf02d\uf0ce ni \uf04c  such that 1\uf03d\niA\n\uf06c . \nCorollary 1 indicates that if the steady state values of the \ndecision certitudes of some of these n  hubs are nonzero, then \nat least one eigenvalue of the influence matrix is equal to one. \nIn order to check whether the steady state values of the \ndecision certitudes of some of these n  hubs are nonzero, it is \nmore easy to check whether there exist eigenvalues of \nAW  \nwhich are equal to one. \nTheorem 1. The set of vectors representing the initial state \nvalues of the decision certitudes of the nodes that satisfies a \ngiven near consensus specification is: \n\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d1 11, ,,  where   and   T T N rk kF X C\uf064 \uf064\uf02d \uf02a \uf02a \uf02d\uf0a2 \uf0a2\uf0a2 \uf0a2\uf0a2\uf0ba \uf02b \uf0ce \uf0ceV V V V x V a x a . \nBased on Definition 2, \n1,k\nX \uf064  is uniquely defined for a \ngiven near consensus specification on \uf064  and 1k . However, not \nall the vectors in \n1,k\nX \uf064  can be expressed as a linear \ncombination of the eigenvectors of W  corresponding to the \neigenvalues equal to one. Theorem 1 characterizes the set of \nvectors representing the initial state values of the decision \ncertitudes of the nodes that satisfies a given near consensus \nspecification. \nLemma 5. Consider a special case where 2\uf03dn  and BW  is a \ndiagonal matrix. Assume that \uf028 \uf029kx  converges to a nonzero \nfixed vector for each \uf028 \uf029 \uf07b \uf07d0x \\0 N\uf0c2\uf0ce .

Suppose that 01 \uf0b3\uf0b3 c . Then, the complex social \nnetwork achieves at least the Nk1  near consensus property \nwith the threshold value larger than or equal to \uf064\uf02d1 . \nLemma 5 refers to the case where there are two hubs with \nhigh connectivity, in which the decisions of these two hubs are \ninfluenced by one another, but not by the other nodes. Also, \nthe decisions of the following k  nodes are influenced by these \ntwo hubs, but not by themselves and by the other nodes. \nMoreover, the sums of the influence weight factors of all the \nnodes are normalized to one and the vectors representing the \ndecision certitudes of the nodes converge to a nonzero vector. \nLemma 5 reveals that \n1,k\nX \uf064  consists of two hyperplanes (i.e., \n\uf05b \uf05d\uf07b TNkk xxccX \uf02a \uf02d\uf02a\uf03d 1, 1 \uf04c\uf04c\uf064 : 01 \uf0b3\uf0b3 c  or \uf07d10 \uf02d\uf0b3\uf02d\uf0b3 c ). \nNote that no conclusion can be drawn on the decisions at the \nrest of \n1kN \uf02d  nodes. Fig. 1 shows a numerical computer \nsimulation result on the steady state values of the decision \ncertitudes of the last ten nodes of the scale free network. It can \nbe seen from Fig. 1 that the steady state values of the decision \ncertitudes of some of these ten nodes are not equal, which \nshow that the exact consensus property is not satisfied. On the \nother hand, those nodes which are influenced by these two \nhubs only are all equal and the value is equal to that of these \ntwo hubs. This implies that the near consensus property is \nsatisfied. \n490 492 494 496 498 500\n-0.8\n-0.7\n-0.6\n-0.5\n-0.4\n-0.3\nNode index\nFi\nna\nl d\nec\nis\nio\nns\n a\nt \ndi\nff\ner\nen\nt \nno\nde\ns\n \nFig. 1.

CONCLUSION  \nIn this paper, an exact consensus property of complex \nsocial networks is extended to a near consensus property, \nwhich is more realistic and practical. It is shown that the \nvectors representing the steady state values of the decision \ncertitudes of the nodes are linear combinations of the \neigenvectors of the influence weight matrix corresponding to \nthe eigenvalues equal to 1. Furthermore, the set of vectors \nrepresenting the initial state values of the decision certitudes \nof the nodes that satisfies a given near consensus specification \nis characterized. \nREFERENCES \n[1] J.
