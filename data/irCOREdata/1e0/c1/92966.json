Globalisation links countries more closely to world systems and at one level the world \nand its policy problems have come to appear more homogeneous. As Castells says  \n\u2018for the first time in history the whole planet is organised round a largely common set of economic \nrules.\u2019 (Castells, 2000: 369). States and policymakers face problems that are apparently similar \nacross nations and are encouraged by supranational organisations such as the European Union, \nOECD, World Bank or IMF to apply standard solutions (Deacon, 1997). Researchers are called on \nto provide data that allow comparison of policies across nations and that bolster beliefs that policy \nmakers in one country can learn from the success or failure of policy making in another. \u2018Within a \nmore integrated European environment, it is becoming increasingly important to allow access \nacross national and linguistic boundaries so that decision-makers can be provided with a broader, \ncomparative picture of society across the continent\u2019 (Matthews and Wilson, 2000). Such statements \nimply an approach to the translation of information that will eliminate as much cultural variation as \npossible in order to produce standardised and comparable data. It is also an approach that obscures \nthe power relations inherent in the production, translation and use of information.  \n \nHowever to suggest that globalisation is a set of processes that simply homogenise nations would be \none sided. The \u2018paradox\u2019 of globalisation applies in the field of translation as in most others. \nHistorical or cultural differences may be ignored or taken for granted until they are highlighted by \nthe import of concepts or policies that are acceptable in an international global context but begin to \nappear alien once they come into contact with local realities. At the same time as acting as a \nhomogenising force, the attempt to translate information across nations or from international to \nnational or local levels may make cultural and historical differences between countries more salient.  \n \nThe issues of culture and power relations outlined above can be considered in terms of the different \nparadigms that frame the efforts of translators. The highly \u2018scientific\u2019 is seen as the standard for one \nparadigm and the highly contextual as another. In either case there are issues of power relationships \nbut the \u2018scientific\u2019 paradigm is virtually certain to incorporate top down power relationships, while \nthe contextual can, but often does not, take a bottom up approach. The roots of the \u2018scientific\u2019 \nparadigm lie in early beliefs about the language of the natural sciences which were, and still may \nbe, deemed to be culture free (see quote from Matthew and Wilson below). Social scientists aimed \nto emulate natural science and develop technical languages that all practitioners in a discipline \nwould use and that would become international modes of communication, recognised by all. Terms \nand concepts were to be precisely defined and meanings were meant to be value free and \nunambiguous. Economics and the more positivistic branches of demography have been able to \ndevelop this paradigm most successfully (even though some would dispute that demography was a \nsocial science (Caldwell, 1996). Many researchers and policy makers subscribe to this ideal of value \nfree research, and they provide strong support for translators who work within a scientific paradigm. \nTranslation becomes much less problematic if it can be assumed that each country has its own set of \ntechnical social science terms that are clearly defined and are either used internationally or are \nsubject to internationally recognised forms of translation. If the actual data is in the form of \nnumbers then, according to this paradigm, the only issue of one of definition. Numerical data can be \nseen as more  or less culture free once they have been satisfactorily harmonised. For example every \ncountry in Europe collects statistics on part time working in ways that suit their own local \nadministrative systems, but careful definition and annotation can harmonise them into cross national \ndata sets with standardised categories, at least in theory (see below).  \n \nThe translation of data becomes very much more obviously contestable once researchers step \noutside the scientific paradigm. Data of any type are produced by different actors: those who collect \nthe data; those who will read or use text or tables in the original country or language; those who will \ntranslate it; and users in other countries or international organisations. All are likely to bring \ndifferent cultural influences to their understanding of the meaning of the data, and they are likely to \noperate within different systems of power relations. The raw material for social policy research is \nusually produced via administrative, social and political systems that embody power relations that \nare rooted in history, culture, and economic organisation, among other aspects of society. Data in \nthe form of administrative records of one sort or another \u201care shaped by the political context in \nwhich they are produced and by the cultural and ideological assumptions that lie behind it. They are \nmost obviously shaped by general cultural assumptions with specific manifestations in such ideas as \n\u2018individual responsibility\u2019 and \u2018the sanctity of life\u2019, and widely accepted sexist, patriarchal and \nracist values.\u201d (Scott, 1990: 60). These values may seem entirely \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018natural\u2019 to those who \nproduce the text, and those for whom the text is intended. On the other hand they may arouse strong \nfeelings of hostility or disempowerment in others who are opposed ideologically to aspects of \ndominant culture, or who feel oppressed or threatened by a status quo that excludes them in some \nway. When such texts are translated, those who accept the dominant values may find nothing to \ncontest. They can ignore the power relations embodied in the data because they are at home within \nthem and can assume (possibly correctly) that meanings, which they attach to text embodying \ndominant values, are similar across cultures. Others, such as women or ethnic minorities, may find \nthe translation even more unsatisfactory than home grown dominant discourses.  \n \nA related point for cross-national researchers is that different values systems and power relations \ncan result in different data gaps. The policy agenda is controlled in ways that allow some problems \nto emerge and others to stay hidden. The same goes for data collected. For example there may be \nlegal texts dealing with domestic violence in one country but none in another. On the statistical \nlevel, youth homelessness may exist as a category or it may not. Its absence should not be \ninterpreted as indicating that there are no youths without homes. Larger numbers are involved in the \nmassive under enumeration of women headed households in most of Latin America (Moser,) or the \nfailure to count certain minority groups.   \n \nOne strength of text, as opposed to numerical data, is that problems with words or concepts can be \nsignalled in different ways. Words or concepts representing cultural differences can be left \nuntranslated on the grounds that cultural differences are best signalled by leaving words in their \noriginal language and making no attempt at translation. This approach has the advantage of clearly \nindicating that a word, phrase or concept cannot easily be translated. It is flagged as problematic by \nitalics or some other typographical indicator that a different language is being used. Readers can \nchoose whether to inform themselves of the cultural background that makes this practice advisable, \nor they may not. However unless they go further they will not be aware of the power relations that \nproduced the cultural difference being signalled. One alternative as in MIRE (date ? Jean Paul How \ndo we reference your glossary ) is to provide cultural information that not only highlights policy \nrelated historical differences across countries, but is specifically aimed at policy makers and so \nimplicity takes a top down perspective.  \n \nAlthough the influence of culture, theory and power relations can be seen clearly in text (for those \nwho wish to recognise them) the same influences are at work in quantitative data. Mukherjee and \nWuyts (1998) for example address their readers in the following terms \u2026.\u2019data are always theory \ninspired. But this should not lead you to think that the substance of data is entirely reducible to \ntheories and concepts or is purely subjective in nature\u2026\u2026To say that national accounts data are \ntheory inspired means that theory determines which data are deemed to be relevant  and informs the \nway that these data are collected and structured into meaningful policy-relevant macro-aggregates \nsuch as GDP, national income, consumption, investments, savings , and so on\u2019 (Mukherjee and \nWuyts, 1998: 248).  Although they see the value of standardisation of theoretical frameworks across \ndata sets and countries, they are aware that the attempt to eliminate local differences can lead to a \nuniformity or comparability that may be highly misleading. They go on to say. \u2018This often leads \nresearchers who work with secondary data and who are mostly consumers (rather than producers) of \nthese data, to see them as hard facts because a lot of the variability and uncertainty within such data \nhave been carefully removed\u2026. Not uncommonly, therefore, these researchers (macro-economists, \nsociologists working with survey data, or demographers) tend to be more affirmative in their views \nof reality, and see their conclusions as being more objective than those of researchers involved in \nfield work.\u2019 (Mukherjee and Wuyts, 1998: 248). Such uncritical approaches also imply a passive or \neven an active acceptance of the power relations that informed the collection of the data. Feminists, \nfor example would see the failure to count women\u2019s unpaid work as part of national accounting data \nas a serious source of bias. Mainstream economists or policy makers are more likely to view the \ndata as sound, and feminists as biased \u2013 at least until opinion in their countries moves in favour of \nfeminist theories of reality. Translators can work with or against the values of those who produced \nthe original data. \n \nThe location and contextualisation text or numbers within their own cultural or national \nbackgrounds is greatly to be welcomed. Translation and comparison is less likely to be misleading \nor to result in the failure of policy transfer if differences can be signalled. On the other hand the \nproblem of the contextualisation of power relations remains. The question becomes: whose history \nor culture is relevant to the data under consideration? It may be reasonable to assume a common \nunderstanding of power relations. For example statistical data that are used in a pan European \ncontext are virtually all collected by government or under government auspices (academics financed \nby government or quasi governmental bodies). They are likely to incorporate top down values and \ncommon European patriarchal and racist attitudes. However the impact of common values can still \ndiffer across religious or historical contexts. For example the definition of single parent families and \nthe collection of data that is deemed to be policy relevant in most European countries (Finland has \nno tradition of differentiating between children with one or two parents) differs by country. Beliefs \ninfluencing the formulation of policy problems are relevant: Is single parenthood is seen as a \nproblem for mothers (how many single parents are there?) or for children (how many children live \nin single parent households?). It might seem obvious to collect data on both aspects but this is not a \npan European standard. (Corden, this vol).  \n \nMeta data \n \nWhatever the problems of contextualising translated data, the reality is a massive upsurge in cross-\nnational data sets. They have in the past been produced mainly by international organisations but in \nthe future the data archives of individual countries will be accessible cross-nationally. The \npossibilities of comparison are almost limitless. Some will deny that such data can be used without \nintense annotation, but others will use it anyway. The question then becomes: What constitutes \n\u2018good enough\u2019 cross-national data? As noted above by Mukherjee and Wuyts, quantitative archives \nappear to present less challenges to translators than qualitative and they are also more likely to be \nused by policy makers who see them as \u2018scientific\u2019. Since the data are already numerical there is no \nneed to translate the vast bulk of it but researchers still need to access the data by name or \ndefinition. The response is to develop meta data which can describe existing data sets. For example \nthe UK Data Archive has over a 20 years period developed the Humanities And Social Science \nElectronic Thesaurus (HASSET ). Even within this monolingual thesaurus Miller has noted that \nthere are areas where the terms used have become very culturally and institutionally biased (Miller, \n2000). The thesaurus provides a \u2018controlled vocabulary\u2019 which is arranged in hierarchies so that for \nexample a search for \u2018old age\u2019 will produce \u2018elderly\u2019 as a narrower term and \u2018ageing\u2019, \u2018geriatrics\u2019, \n\u2018social disadvantage\u2019, \u2018social problems\u2019 as related terms, while the whole search falls under the top \nlevel heading of \u2018age groups\u2019. It is clear that the thesaurus embodies a negative view of old age and \nits meta data would be seen as ageist by any critical gerontologist.  \n \nA monoliguistic culturally biased thesaurus in one thing, but multilingual thesauri have to face \nmuch more severe problems. In the future there will be multi-lingual tools for user access to data in \nsocial science archives across Europe. Still more complex, this data will be integrated with data \nfrom non-social science domains. Users will be able \u2018to retrieve and communicate it in the \nlanguage(s) of their choice, as a basis for further research, policy making and planning by \nindividuals, companies and government organisations. . . . It will also allow data from social policy \nsets to be correlated with information from other domains, such as environmental (e.g. weather, \npollution), geographic (e.g. GIS) and health (e.g. genetics)\u2019 ( Matthews and Wilson, 2000). These \nare areas which may in future be part of social policy and access to more cross-cultural data could \nstrengthen new developments in social policy formulation and research. At the same time, \nbroadening the scope of the meta data required to access the archives will raise still more problems \nin terms of cultural difference and power relations. For example, anything that opposes local needs \nto the interests of global capitalism, as issues of pollution so often do, also involves careful \nconsideration of power relations. The absence of data in sensitive areas, as noted above, also needs \nto be recognised as political. \n \nThe basic language of  development for the Language Independent Metadata Browsing of European \nResources (LIMBER) project in English. Given the way that UK social policy has diverged from \nthat in the rest of Europe, this maybe a handicap as far as social policy researchers are concerned. \nThere is likely to be more cultural similarity between the countries of continental Europe and a \ndifferent core language might have been a better choice. The developers are aware of the problems \neven though they operate largely within the scientific paradigm. Matthews and Wilson (2000) state \nthat a \u2018major problem in providing terms in other languages, is that the \"equivalent term\" in other \nlanguages may not provide an exact match (my emphasis); this is particularly a problem in social \nscience (as opposed to the physical sciences) where the exact meaning of terms is culturally \ndependent. This problem may be further exacerbated when the thesauri are arranged in hierarchies. \nThe broader or narrower terms appropriate in one culture may not be appropriate in another\u2019. Ken \nMiller (2000) in a report on a different workshop notes that \u2018Translating from English to each \nlanguage might lead to non-equivalence between the other languages. The need for backward and \nsideways translations was thought essential\u2019.  \n \nAs noted above the data itself will not require translation but the definition of fields and values will \nhave to be translated in ways that make clear how the numerical data can be interpreted. For \nexample part time and full time work are categories that overlap even within countries. The number \nof hours of work per week that determines the boundary between work classified as part time and \nwork classified as full time is very different across countries. Simple totals of the two categories \nwill be highly misleading if tabulated cross-nationally. On the other hand meta data that clarified \ndefinitions for each country would help greatly in allowing researchers to compare like with like, or \nto highlight sources of inaccuracy or bias.  \n \n \nConclusions \n \n \nTranslation from one language to another can be considered on a continuum from the uncontested \nto the highly contested. However it can be argued that all data used in social policy research and \npractice represents the taken for granted assumptions of a certain set of beliefs and power relations \nand so social policy translation is always contestable. The production of numbers obscures but does \nnot eliminate issues of culture and the relationships of power, but the processes involved are clearer \nin translating text.  \n \nWe can therefore contrast text and numbers in terms of the overt problems they pose for translation \nand for cross national social policy research. Text composed of words, phrases, sentences or in \nparticular forms such as legal documents, is easily linked to history and culture. If differences are \nnoted, readers can position themselves in relation to the data, as supporters of the status quo or other \ndominant discourse, supporters of an alternative set of values or ideological positions, or take some \nother, even apparently neutral, stance. We may contrast text with the process of accessing \nquantitative survey data across national and linguistic boundaries. New developments involving the \nproduction of meta data that \u2018translate\u2019 national statistical categories into any European Community \nlanguage and allow researchers to access data in their own languages may be seen as the ultimate \ncase of the apparent obliteration of history, culture and differential power relations from the \npresentation of policy related data. Those who are developing this meta data are aware of the \nproblems, even though they work within a highly scientific paradigm of translation where \nequivalence of terms is deemed possible, though problematic.  There will be purposes and users for \nwhom this data is \u2018good enough\u2019, but there will also be many cases where the concerns of the \ndevelopers are ignored and data is assumed by users to be culture free.  \n \nAny translation may reinforce the limitations of the original data by ignoring cultural difference. It \nmay also reinforce unequal power relations by its implicit acceptance of the position of those who \ncreated the data, or those who will be using them when translated. Ethical questions may arise here \nsince so much of social policy already deals with deprived groups and as globalisation multiples the \nforces of social exclusion (Castells, 2000). Translations then become contested not on the grounds \nof cultural difference but because they represent manifestations of contested power relations.  \n \nThe outcomes of globalisation are contradictory. On the one had there is much greater \nunderstanding of the problems of translation as concepts and policies are transferred and the short \ncomings of simple translation become clearer. On the other had the thrust to make data bases \navailable to supra national organisations and comparative researchers appears unstoppable. The \noutcome is likely to be growing harmony and comparability of both text and numerical information. \nThis will be accompanied by a degree of obliteration of history and culture in the interest of \nproducing standardised and more fully comparable data sets. The same process will encourage the \nchoice and prioritisation of certain, mainly top down power relationships, but this too is likely to \nhighlight the need for alternative data sets that manifest other values and other power relationships \n \n \n \nReferences \nCaldwell, J.C., ( 1996), 'Demography and Social Science', Population Studies, 50, 3, 305-331 \nCastells, M., (2000), End of Millennium Vol III, Oxford, Blackwells \n \nDeacon, B., (1998), Global Social Policy, London, Sage \n \nHantrais, L. and Mangen,S.
