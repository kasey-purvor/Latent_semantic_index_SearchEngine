Riometers are used, often in conjunction\nwith other instruments, to study ionospheric processes which\nin turn relate to space weather and high frequency (HF) com-\nmunications links. Most of the ionospheric absorption occurs\nin the D region of the ionosphere, primarily due to high en-\nergy particle precipitation (electrons and protons) and ioniza-\ntion by UV and x rays. For riometry purposes the average\nheight of the absorbing layer is usually considered to be 90\nkm. Riometers are typically classified as either wide beam or\nimaging; both are now introduced in more detail.\nWide-beam riometers consist of a simple antenna\nsystem with an azimuthally symmetric radiation pattern;\nconsequently, they have a wide field of view but no imaging\ncapabilities. The antenna is connected to a receiving device\nwhich measures the power of the incoming \u201csignal\u201d (cosmic\nbackground noise). In the absence of geomagnetic activity\nthe received power forms a baseline, or \u201cquiet day curve\u201d\nfrom which absorption measurements can be derived. Due\nto their relatively simple construction, wide-beam riometers\nare inexpensive to build and operate. They are useful for\na general overview of the current state of the ionosphere,\na)Electronic mail: f.honary@lancaster.ac.uk.\nbut do not provide any information on the spatial structure\nand dynamics within their field of view. There are over 50\nwide-beam riometers in operation worldwide.\nUsing a narrow-beam antenna Nielsen and Axford2\ndemonstrated that the high-energy electron precipitation had\nspatial and dynamic structures similar to those observed op-\ntically for lower energies in association with the aurora.\nKikuchi, Yamagishi, and Sato3 used a scanning riometer\nsystem4 to observe cosmic noise absorption pulsations with\na large azimuthal m-number that wide-beam riometer chains\nwould have difficulty in observing. However, the scanning ri-\nometer could only observe a cross-shaped area of the sky. The\nneed for higher spatial resolution and simultaneous observa-\ntion of the viewing area led to the development of imaging\nriometers. There are currently more than 25 imaging riome-\nters in operation globally, working at frequencies between 30\nand 40 MHz.\nThe first imaging riometer, known as IRIS (imaging\nriometer for ionospheric studies), was deployed at the\nSouth Pole in 1998.5 Utilizing 8 \u00d7 8 = 64 crossed-dipoles\nconfigured as a filled phased array6, 7 and a modified two-\ndimensional (2D) analog Butler matrix,8 it produces 7 \u00d7 7\n= 49 imaging beams. Beam width at the zenith is 12.8\u25e6,\nwhich translates to 20.2 km at a height of 90 km. To\nsimplify the hardware requirements IRIS scans each row\nonce every second; thus, only 7 riometers (one per column)\nare required instead of 49 (one per beam). As a result of the\nscanning process each beam is switched to a riometer for\n95 ms, and the noise-balancing technique employed means\n0034-6748\/2011\/82(3)\/031301\/15\/$30.00 \u00a9 2011 American Institute of Physics82, 031301-1\n031301-2 Honary et al. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 82, 031301 (2011)\nthat the antenna signal is observed for just 47.5 ms. Further\ndevelopment led to a smaller 4 \u00d7 4 antenna system with\n16 beams for use in automated geophysical observato-\nries (PENGUIN IRIS);9 the low power requirements also\nnecessitated a reduction in cadence to 12 s. By cadence\nwe mean the time interval between the start of successive\nmeasurements, as defined by the Space Physics Archive\nSearch and Extract (SPASE) data dictionary.10 Based on\nthe successful IRIS design other groups around the world\nconstructed similar instruments, such as an 8 \u00d7 8 system\nusing an unmodified Butler matrix to create 64 beams,11\ndeployed at Tjornes, Iceland. While the unmodified But-\nler matrix results in an enlarged field of view, modeling\nshows that it comes at the cost of increased side lobes in\nthe outer and corner beams. The system at Tjornes also\ndiffers in that the antenna spacing has been increased to\n0.65\u03bb, which reduces the field of view to increase angular\nresolution.\nThe largest phased array imaging riometer is located\nat Poker Flat, Alaska.12 It utilizes 16 \u00d7 16 = 256 antennas\nand standard Butler matrices to produce 256 beams with\na maximum cadence of 1 s. It achieves a beam width of\n6.6\u25e6 at the zenith. However, for 48 phasing patterns with\nlobes at larger zenith angles there is no production of a\nclear main lobe; thus, the number of usable beams is 208.\nTo increase the spatial resolution of a filled phased array\nantenna by n, the number of required antenna elements\nincreases with n2, rendering very high resolution phased\narray antennas impractical. A 16 \u00d7 16 antenna array presents\na significant expense, which is one reason why only one such\nsystem exists. The physical requirements are substantial, a\n256 antenna array operating at 38.2 MHz requires a flat area of\nover 60 \u00d7 60 m due to the antenna spacing dimensions at this\nfrequency.12\nThe measurement precision limit at present is around\n0.04\u20130.05 dB at 1 s cadence for an 8 \u00d7 8 antenna\nfilled array system.5, 13 The need for yet higher spatial\nresolution to resolve small-scale structure, for example, in\nstudies utilizing riometer and optical data,14, 15 and riometer\nand radar data,16 plus the requirement for better measurement\nprecision, for example, to determine the quiet absorption\nlevel,17 has led to a new design of digital imaging riometers.\nIn this paper we show how digital beam forming provides a\nrange of configurable options to fulfill the requirements of\nhigher spatial resolution, greater measurement precision, and\nhigh time resolution. We describe three different imaging\nriometer implementations in their chronological order of\ndevelopment. First, the Advanced Rio-Imaging Experiment\nin Scandinavia (ARIES) is based on the Mills cross design\nwith 32 + 32 = 64 antennas. In our implementation there are\n63 antennas; the 15th antenna in each arm being common to\nboth arms. However, this is not a necessary condition so we\nwill use the notation 32 + 32 = 64 for a Mills cross system\nwith two arms of 32 antennas each. We also describe two\ndesigns of filled phased array imaging riometers, one using\nan 8 \u00d7 8 = 64 antenna array and the other with a 4 \u00d7 4 = 16\nantenna array. All systems use the same modular hardware\nand we report the performance improvements obtained by\neach system.\nII. MILLS CROSS SYSTEM, WITH 32 + 32 ANTENNAS\nThe Mills cross technique18\u201320 provides a means to ful-\nfill the requirement of higher spatial resolution. Such a ri-\nometer is based on the principle of cross-correlating signals\nfrom the two perpendicular fan beams formed by the per-\npendicular linear phased arrays, as first conceived and used\nby Mills21 and Christiansen and Mathewson22 albeit not for\nriometry purposes. The main advantage of this type of an-\ntenna arrangement is that it can achieve high spatial resolution\nwith significantly fewer antenna elements when compared to\na filled array antenna.23 To achieve n times the resolution, the\nnumber of antenna elements required now only increases lin-\nearly with n and not n2. A three-dimensional illustration of\nthe beam-forming process for a Mills cross antenna array is\nshown in Fig. 1. The process can be broken down into two\ndiscrete stages:\nStage One\u2014Fan beams. Initially, each arm of the cross is\nconsidered as a separate linear phased array. Each arm forms\nseveral \u201cfan beams,\u201d the pointing directions of which are de-\ntermined by a one-dimensional (1D) digital beam-forming\nmatrix. By themselves, the fan beams still cover a large solid\nangle, the spatial resolution in one direction is still very poor.\nStage Two\u2014Pencil beams. The concept that turns the\nMills cross antenna array into a high resolution array is to\ncross-correlate the signals from two perpendicular fan beams.\nOne can consider the cosmic background as many indepen-\ndent noise sources distributed over the visible hemisphere.\nThe cross-correlation process extracts the signals that origi-\nnate from the overlapping region of the two fan beams (our\n\u201csignal\u201d). Noise sources which are within the two fan beams\nbut outside of the common area degrade the signal-to-noise\nFIG. 1. (Color) Beam forming for a Mills cross imaging riometer system.\nThe two small panels on the left show an example of a fan beam formed by\na linear array of antennas along the x-axis (top panel) and along the y-axis\n(bottom panel), respectively. The small inset in the upper right-hand corner\nof each panel shows the \u20133 dB outline of the fan beam in plan view. The\nlarge panel on the right-hand side depicts the cross-correlation process. Two\nperpendicular fan beams (shaded) are cross-correlated to produce a narrow\npencil beam (solid) pointing in the direction where the two fan beams inter-\nsect. The inset shows the \u20133 dB contour of the pencil beam at the same scale\nas the other inset diagrams.\n031301-3 Honary et al. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 82, 031301 (2011)\nFIG. 2. Mills cross block diagram. The total number of antennas actually used is 63, 32 in each arm with one antenna common to both arms. (ARCOM denotes\nAdvanced Riometer Components software.)\nratio (SNR). This illustration forms the basis of the model by\nNielsen, Honary, and Grill.23 A narrow pencil beam is there-\nfore formed for each combination of fan beam from one arm\nwith a fan beam from the other arm of the Mills cross.\nA drawback of a Mills cross-type system, compared to a\nfilled phased array system of similar resolution, is that the\nachievable noise performance is worse due to the reduced\naperture of the antenna array. This issue has been investi-\ngated in Nielsen, Honary, and Grill23 and Hagfors, Grill, and\nHonary 24 showing that it is theoretically feasible to success-\nfully implement a riometer system based on the Mills cross\ntechnique. To achieve this, the bandwidth\u2013time product must\nbe maximized by increasing the receiver bandwidth and the\nproportion of each second for which data is integrated.\nBased on the Mills cross design we have devised a work-\ning imaging riometer system, the Advanced Rio-Imaging Ex-\nperiment in Scandinavia (ARIES), an overview of which is\ngiven in Fig. 2. The system can be separated into three main\nparts, antennas and receivers, digital beam forming, and data\nacquisition and processing.\nA. Antennas and receivers\nThe ARIES antenna array consists of two arms of\n32 antennas aligned in geographic North\u2013South and East\u2013\nWest directions. Each antenna is a freestanding half-wave\ncrossed dipole25 with an azimuthally symmetric radiation\npattern and spaced at \u03bb\/2 from its neighbors. The dipoles\nare aligned NE\u2013SW and NW\u2013SE. There are 63 antennas\nin total, the central one is shared between the two arms.\nThe crossed dipoles are circularly polarized to match the\npolarization of the more strongly absorbed X-mode incom-\ning \u201csignal\u201d from the cosmic noise background. Each an-\ntenna is mounted on a wooden mast at a height of 1.96 m,\ni.e., \u03bb\/4 for the center frequency of 38.235 MHz.\nThe mast and each of the four antenna elements are supported\nby guy ropes. A ground plane one wavelength wide, made of\nmetal mesh, is laid out under both arms of the array. Low-\nloss coaxial cables of electrically identical length (to within\n\u00b11\u25e6 phase accuracy at 38.235 MHz) connect each antenna to\nthe receiver hardware in the hut. The signal from the com-\nmon antenna is fed into one receiver whose output is digitally\nduplicated for both the X and Y arms.\nA low-noise multichannel simultaneously sampled re-\nceiver has been developed specifically for use in digital ri-\nometry. A modular approach was taken to allow for ease of\nconstruction, development, testing, and on-site servicing. The\nreceiver channels are paired so that two receiver channels are\ncolocated on a standard 220 \u00d7 100 mm Eurocard printed cir-\ncuit board. The block diagram of a single homodyne channel\nis shown in Fig. 3. Each channel has two inputs to allow for\nthe receiver to be switched to a calibration signal, which is\nimportant for the accurate power calculations required. The\ncontrol lines for all solid-state RF switches are connected to-\ngether and are controlled by the data recording computer. The\nfiltered RF signal is amplified by a Minicircuits MAR-8ASM\nmonolithic microwave integrated circuit amplifier and split\ninto two separate signals. One is mixed with the local oscil-\nlator (LO) signal and the other with a 90\u25e6 phase-shifted ver-\nsion of the LO signal to form in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q)\nsignals.\nThe diplexer provides the mixer with 50 \u0003 termination\nover a wide frequency range. This ensures the intermodula-\ntion and port isolation performance of the mixer is not de-\ngraded. After down-conversion the baseband signals undergo\nthree cascaded amplifications and filter stages before entering\na simultaneously sampling 14 bit analog to digital converter\n(ADC). The gain of the second amplification stage can be pro-\ngrammed from the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) us-\nDiplexer\nDiplexer\nBPF\nAmp.\nSplitter\nAmp.\nAmp.

Instrum. 82, 031301 (2011)\ning a 3 bit digital control; gain controls for all receiver mod-\nules are ganged together. At the third amplification stage the\ngain of the I and Q signals can be trimmed to enable a precise\nmatch, and dc offsets can be removed separately.\nTo obtain the required measurement precision the\nbandwidth\u2013time product was maximized by setting the re-\nceiver bandwidth to 1 MHz as opposed to the typical 200 kHz\nused by analog beam-forming imaging riometers; an earlier\nsite survey had found no man-made sources of noise in the\nband 37.7\u201338.7 MHz. Additionally, by employing indepen-\ndent receivers, data from each beam are integrated for more\nthan 95% of each second [the remaining 5% is used by the\nFPGA for transferring the data to the host personal computer\n(PC)] as opposed to less than 5% for typical IRIS-type ri-\nometers, which multiplex one receiver between seven beams\nand switch between received power and calibration noise\nsource with a duty cycle of 50% (noise-balancing technique).5\nThe receiver bandwidth requirement of 1 MHz was met by\nthe ADC sampling at 1.47 MHz. Each ADC outputs multi-\nplexed in-phase and quadrature serial data onto a single data\nline, thus reducing the wiring between receiver rack and PC-\nmounted signal processing card. The inputs to each receiver\nboard are the local oscillator signal, the control signals for the\nprogrammable gain amplifier, the digital clock, and the con-\nvert signal for the ADC.\nAll receiver boards required for the complete system are\nhoused along with the local oscillator, digital clock generator,\ncalibration noise source, and other peripheral electronics in\nan industry-standard 12 U 19\u2032\u2032 subrack. The three supply volt-\nages (12 V, \u22125 V, and +5 V) required for the receiver elec-\ntronics are provided by a set of linear power supplies. These\nare also modular in construction and are housed in an addi-\ntional 19\u2032\u2032 subrack.\nThe digital clock signal is generated by a commercial\ntemperature-compensated crystal oscillator module operating\nat 50 MHz. The digital clock is divided by a factor of 34 to\nproduce the ADC convert signal at 1.470588 MHz. The local\noscillator signal is generated by a Colpitts oscillator with the\ncrystal operating as a filter; the entire LO circuitry is housed\nwithin a temperature-controlled oven. To prevent harmonics\nof the convert signal affecting the receiver, the local oscillator\nfrequency was set to 38.235294 MHz; thus, the 26th harmonic\nof the ADC convert signal exactly matches the local oscillator\nfrequency; any harmonics from the convert signal which en-\nter the receiver either fall outside the pass band or are mixed\nto a dc signal which is blocked by the ac coupling between\namplifier stages. The calibration signal source is derived from\na noise diode and outputs white noise over the receiver pass\nband; both the noise diode and distribution amplifier oper-\nate inside a miniature temperature-controlled oven. The local\noscillator and calibration signals are buffered and distributed\nto all receivers via power-splitters and phase-matched coaxial\ncables.\nB. Digital beam forming\nPrevious imaging riometer designs (e.g. Detrick and\nRosenberg,5 Murayama et al.,12 and Yamagishi et al.11) have\nbeen constructed using analog Butler matrices. Technological\nadvances have enabled us to implement one-dimensional dig-\nital Butler matrices using an FPGA to evaluate a fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT), which is the digital equivalent of the analog\nButler matrix.6 The digital approach provides a number of\nadvantages: size and cost are greatly reduced, programmable\ntapering of the array is readily implemented, reduced losses\nand variability due to the reduction in analogue electronics,\nand better real-time diagnostic capability of individual\nantennas and receiver channels. However, the computational\nrequirements are demanding; the receivers output data at a\nrate of 2.63 Gbit\/s (64 receivers \u00d7 2 complex channels \u00d7 14\nbits\/sample \u00d7 1.47 Msamples\/s). In addition, beam forming\nfor a Mills cross requires the cross-correlation of data from\nall sets of perpendicular fan beams in real time. Through\nappropriate parallelization it was possible to implement both\nbeam-forming stages and the cross-correlator onto a single\nXilinx Virtex-IITMXC2V8000 field-programmable gate array.\nAlthough the beam-forming process creates 1024 beams\nnot all of these are deemed usable; for some the fans beams\ndo not fully intersect (i.e., their \u22123 dB gain contours do not\nintersect), while others with large zenithal angles (>55\u25e6) have\nlarger side lobes than is desirable. Although data from all\n1024 beams are recorded the postprocessing software nor-\nmally uses data from the 556 beams with zenith angles <55\u25e6\nand for which the pair of perpendicular fan beams fully inter-\nsect. A Mills cross riometer comprising two arms of 32 anten-\nnas each can theoretically achieve a beam width at the zenith\nof 4.5\u25e6, although with higher side lobes (\u20136.5 dB) than for a\nfilled array. ARIES utilizes cosine tapering to reduce the side\nlobes, which range from \u201317.4 dB at the center of the field\nof view to \u201313.1 dB for beams with zenith angles of 54.9\u25e6;\nthis is actually better than for IRIS riometers, which range\nfrom \u201313.3 dB for the zenithal beam to \u20135.37 dB for the cor-\nner beams (or \u20139.09 dB for the beams adjacent to the corner\nbeams). As a result of tapering the beam width at the zenith\nis enlarged to 6.56\u25e6. This beam width is achieved with 63 an-\ntennas; for comparable performance from a filled-array 256\nantennas would be required.\nA block diagram of the FPGA processing software is\nshown in Fig. 4. The 32 in-phase and quadrature outputs from\nthe X-arm are double-buffered and then converted to one se-\nrial data stream. To remove any offsets from the ADCs the\nsignals are then passed through a first-order high-pass digi-\ntal filter with a corner frequency of 9.7 Hz. The dc offset re-\nmoval is applied independently to each of the 64 serial data\nvalues. Each receiver output can be tapered and\/or rotated by\nmultiplying the in-phase\/quadrature pair with a complex ta-\npering coefficient (real and imaginary parts are each signed\n16 bit values). The 32 receiver signals are passed through\na one-dimensional FFT which outputs 32 complex signals\n(analogous to 32 fan beam outputs) to the cross-correlator.\nAn identical parallel processing stream operates on data from\nthe Y-arm. From its 64 complex inputs the cross-correlator\ngenerates 1024 complex signals, each with a data rate of\n1.47 Msamples\/s. All 1024 complex signals are accumulated\nand output as 64 bit values at 1 s cadence. The FPGA also\ncomputes and outputs the signal power from each receiver,\nagain at 1 s cadence (analogous to 63 independent wide-beam\nriometers).\n031301-5 Honary et al. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 82, 031301 (2011)\nFIG. 4. (Color) Block diagram of the FPGA processing for the ARIES Mills cross. Filled boxes show stages processed within the FPGA. (ARIES denotes\nAdvanced Rio-Imaging Experiment in Scandinavia. FIFO denotes a first in, first out buffer.)\nThe entire processing system is controlled by a finite-\nstate machine, which is synchronized to the start of the sec-\nond boundary by a pulse-per-second (PPS) signal from an\nexternal global positioning system (GPS) receiver. Periodi-\ncally, the finite-state machine switches the receiver RF inputs\nto the calibration noise source to enable autonomous calibra-\ntion by the postprocessing software. The default behavior can\nbe modified by uploading a parameter block containing var-\nious configuration parameters, including the tapering coeffi-\ncients, on\/off durations for the calibration interval timers, and\nthe number of samples to integrate per second. The block di-\nagram shows the latest revision of the FPGA processing soft-\nware. Originally, the filters for dc offset removal were not in-\ncluded as it was thought that the circuitry contained in the\nreceivers would provide the necessary functionality. How-\never, it was found that temperature variations experienced\nin the field caused changes in the dc offsets of the ADC;\nthe cross-correlation is very sensitive to such common-mode\nchanges which manifest as an apparent increase in power for\nthe four near-zenithal beams. The introduction of digital filter-\ning overcame this problem. Calculation and recording of re-\nceiver power were added to provide wide-beam riometer data.\nAdditional FPGA programs provide support for system\ntesting and maintenance operations, such as adjustment of\nthe receiver offset and gain controls and inspection of the\nraw data samples. Execution of the test programs requires the\nstandard recording software to be stopped and the test pro-\ngram to be uploaded to the FPGA, which then reprograms its\ninternal logic gates.\nC. Data acquisition and processing\nARIES operation is controlled and monitored by an\nindustry-standard PC that connects to the beam-forming\nFPGA through the industry-standard Peripheral Component\nInterconnect (PCI) bus. Bespoke Advanced Riometer Compo-\nnents (ARCOM) software26 running on the PC is responsible\nfor encapsulating the raw data into an appropriate streaming\ndata format similar to the format used in digital video broad-\ncasting. Data can be disseminated to remote file servers both\nin real time and in nightly bursts as well as stored locally.\nAdditional processing, for example, postintegration, and vi-\nsualization components can be plugged in and out as required\nand without interrupting system operation. All components\ncan be controlled and monitored remotely. The archived raw\ndata stream from ARIES during standard operation amounts\nto 1.5 GB\/day. Offline data processing, creation of quiet day\ncurves, etc., are performed using the Multi-Instrument Anal-\nysis (MIA) package27 for MATLAB.\nOne factor which can affect imaging riometer data qual-\nity is scintillation from point sources, in particular the cos-\nmic radio sources Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A in the northern\nhemisphere and Sagittarius A* in the southern hemisphere.\nScintillation is caused by ionospheric irregularities and pro-\nduces rapid fluctuations in the apparent power level, thereby\nmaking absorption measurements on short time scales inaccu-\nrate. With knowledge of the beam radiation pattern and loca-\ntion of the radio sources, it is possible to predict which beams\nmay be affected and when. Based upon this approach a fil-\nter in MIA is able to remove or smooth data which may be\naffected by scintillation. The level at which this filter is acti-\nvated can be adjusted, with the threshold given in decibels rel-\native to gain in the beam-pointing direction. The occurrence\nand number of beams potentially affected by scintillation for\nvarious radio sources are given in Table I.\nAnother factor which can affect data quality in a Mills\ncross system derives from the correlation process; the antenna\ngain is complex, which creates both \u201cpositive side lobes\u201d and\n\u201cnegative side lobes.\u201d24, 28 When strong signals enter the neg-\native side lobes an apparent decrease in signal power can re-\nsult. If a negative side lobe coincides with a region of iono-\nspheric absorption the decrease in power is reduced; thus, an\napparent increase in signal power is seen. Traditional algo-\nrithms for generating the quiet day curve, which often look\nfor the upper received power envelope, must be used with\ncaution.\n031301-6 Honary et al. Rev. Sci.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 82, 031301 (2011)\nThe variation on received power by sources passing\nthrough side lobes is not unique to Mills cross riometers, al-\nthough filled arrays only feature positive side lobes, and il-\nlustrates why the control of side lobes is so important. As\nmentioned previously (Sec. II B) the side lobes in ARIES\nare better controlled than side lobes of filled array riometers\nsuch as IRIS. As a result of the weak side lobes the negative\nside lobe effect is limited to when the strongest sources, Cas-\nsiopeia A and Cygnus A, pass through the negative side lobes,\nit is not observed at any other time. Thus potentially affected\nperiods can be predicted based upon beam and sidereal time.\nMIA contains a filter which can remove samples potentially\naffected by the negative side lobes, similar to the method em-\nployed for removing data affected by scintillation.\nBased on the theoretical beam projection the occur-\nrence of the radio sources Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A pass-\ning through the negative side lobes has been analyzed. It\nwas found that, for ARIES, the loci of Cassiopeia A and\/or\nCygnus A pass through a negative side lobe for 448 of the\n556 beams. The minimum number of beams affected at any\none time is zero, the maximum 31, the mean 12, and the per-\ncentage of total samples affected is just 2.12%. The presence\nof negative side lobes is more complicated than considering\njust the loci of radio sources as the effect is also dependent on\nthe strength of the signal received in the main lobe. In prac-\ntice, the effect is not often noticed but as the possibility of it\noccurring is predictable, potentially affected portions of the\ndata can be automatically blanked out if required. Filled array\nimaging riometers do not use a correlation process, their an-\ntenna gain is not complex, and the issue of negative side lobes\ndoes not arise.\nD. Operation and results\nThe ARIES riometer system began collecting data in Jan-\nuary 2006. Based on the Mills cross approach, previously un-\nproven for riometry, the initial deployment was made using\nanalog Butler matrices. To counteract for signal losses in the\nButler matrices, preamplifiers were installed between the an-\ntennas and the Butler matrices. It was found that temperature\nvariations in the hut caused gain changes in the preampli-\nfiers and as they were outside of the calibration loop it was\nnot possible to compensate for the changes. Various improve-\nments took place including the replacement of the analog But-\nler matrices with the digital approach described previously.\nOperation as a full \u201cproduction\u201d\u2019system, as described in this\npaper, began on March 5, 2007.\nThe higher spatial resolution afforded by ARIES has al-\nlowed a number of scientific discoveries which would not\nhave been possible with existing 8 \u00d7 8 imaging riometers.\nFor instance, Fig. 5 shows phase maps of pulsations at\n3.2 mHz for both IRIS and ARIES riometers for January 17,\n2007 05:30 UT. The high m number, 120, is close to the\nlimiting spatial resolution for IRIS. The higher resolution of\nARIES enables detection of much higher m number events,\nup to 380, some of which are not detectable with other imag-\ning riometers.29\nARIES has also recorded the first direct measurements\nof absorption caused by ionospheric modification (\u201cheating\u201d)\n12\u00b0E 15\u00b0E 18\u00b0E 21\u00b0E 24\u00b0E\n70\u00b0N\n69\u00b0N\n68\u00b0N\n12\u00b0E 15\u00b0E 18\u00b0E 21\u00b0E 24\u00b0E\n71\u00b0N\n68\u00b0N\n69\u00b0N\n70\u00b0N\n71\u00b0N\n30\u2032\n30\u2032\n30\u2032\n30\u2032\n30\u2032\n30\u2032\nFIG. 5. Phase maps showing high m number magnetospheric waves at\n3.2 mHz on January 17, 2007 05:30 UT. While the IRIS riometer (top panel)\ncan observe the waves, the ARIES riometer (bottom panel) is capable of re-\nsolving much greater detail.\nof the D-region by high-power HF radio waves.30 Due to\nthe high-spatial resolution one of the ARIES beams is able\nto fit inside the heater beam. ARIES recorded an absorption\nvalue of \u22480.08 dB, incomplete coverage (such as would oc-\ncur with a riometer with poorer spatial resolution) would have\nreduced the measured absorption value, probably below the\nlimit of the measurement precision. ARIES data have also\nbeen used in conjunction with data from the Kilpisj\u00e4rvi IRIS\nriometer to measure the height of the absorbing layer and\nthus estimate the characteristic energies of the precipitating\nelectrons.31 Similar studies have previously included optical\ndata (e.g., Kosch et al.32), limiting the procedure to cloud-free\ndark periods, whereas the riometer-only approach can be used\nwithout regard to weather or time of day.\nARIES ceased operation in August 2008 due to termina-\ntion of its funding.\nIII. FILLED ARRAY, WITH 8 \u00d7 8 ANTENNAS\nThe modular design used in ARIES enables a filled array\nsystem with 8 \u00d7 8 = 64 antennas to be implemented using\nthe same design with only two minor changes, the antenna\nlayout and the FPGA program. While the spatial resolution\nis not better than the existing IRIS-type design the much\nhigher integration time (952 ms compared to just 95 ms for\n031301-8 Honary et al. Rev. Sci.

Copyright 2010\nLancaster University.\na 1 s cadence) results in a much improved measurement\nprecision. Such a system was deployed at And\u00f8ya, Norway\n(And\u00f8ya IRIS, known as AIRIS) shortly after operation of\nARIES commenced. The electronics hardware is identical\nto that used in ARIES, except for a few component changes\nin the receiver modules to reduce the receiver bandwidth;\nconsequently, only the differences will be discussed below.\nThe antenna array comprises 64 crossed-dipoles, circu-\nlarly polarized for X-mode signals, arranged in an 8 \u00d7 8 grid\nwith each antenna spaced \u03bb\/2 from its neighbor. The sides of\nthe antenna array are aligned with geographic North and East\nand the dipoles are aligned NE\u2013SW and NW\u2013SE. The anten-\nnas are of a different mechanical design to the ARIES anten-\nnas but otherwise are electrically identical. The bandwidth\u2013\ntime product for a filled array is much less critical than for\na Mills cross system, so to reduce the possibility of interfer-\nence the receiver bandwidth was reduced to 250 kHz. A block\ndiagram of the FPGA processing is shown in Fig. 6. In com-\nparison to the ARIES FPGA processing (Fig. 4), it can be\nseen that the dual linear Butler matrices (1D FFT) have been\nreplaced by a single two-dimensional Butler matrix, imple-\nmented as a 2D FFT operation. The cross-correlator has been\nremoved, which significantly decreases the computational re-\nquirements (see Table I). As a result the entire system can be\nimplemented on a single Xilinx Virtex-II XC2V6000 field-\nprogrammable gate array, which is a cheaper version of that\nused for ARIES, with a smaller number of programmable\ngates. The tapering and ADC offset removal functionality are\nnot included as the FPGA program precedes those additions\nto the ARIES FPGA program. An almost identical system was\nlater deployed at Ny-\u00c5lesund, Svalbard in October 2008. As\nNy-\u00c5lesund is a radio-quiet location, where the probability of\nencountering interfering signals is much lower, the bandwidth\nof the system was enlarged to 1 MHz to offset the smaller\nabsorption values typically found inside the polar cap com-\npared to those in auroral oval locations such as Kilpisj\u00e4rvi\nand And\u00f8ya.\nIV. FILLED ARRAY, 4 \u00d7 4 ANTENNAS\nThe modular hardware design used in ARIES and\nAIRIS has permitted the development of a smaller 4 \u00d7 4\nfilled array imaging riometer system, with the advantages\nof lower cost and smaller footprint. The first system was\ndeployed at the Indian Antarctic research station Maitri in\nFebruary 2010. The design follows that of the 8 \u00d7 8 filled\narray system, albeit with a reduced number of antennas (16)\nand receivers (16). The standard Butler matrix design (16\nbeams, with no zenithal beam) was implemented as with\nfewer antennas; the corner beams do not suffer from grating\nlobes.\nThe block diagram of the FPGA processing, shown in\nFig. 7, incorporates a number of software developments from\nthe ARIES FPGA program. The 16 in-phase and 16 quadra-\nture outputs from the ADCs are double-buffered and are then\nconverted to one serial data stream. The signals are then\npassed through a first-order high-pass digital filter (as used in\nARIES, fc = 9.7 Hz) to remove any offsets from the ADCs.\nThe dc offset removal is applied independently to each of the\n32 serial data values. Inside the gain control the signal level of\neach in-phase\/quadrature pair is scaled with a 16 bit unsigned\ninteger value. Each signal can be tapered and\/or rotated by\nmultiplying the in-phase\/quadrature pair with a complex ta-\npering coefficient (real and imaginary parts are each signed\n16 bit values). If desired the dc offset removal, gain, and taper-\ning stages can all be independently bypassed (not shown in the\nfigure). The serial data stream is reordered to four serial data\nstreams based on the antenna rows and a two-dimensional\nFFT computed. The signal values from each beam are squared\nand accumulated to provide a single power value for each\nbeam.\nIn addition to the beam-formed output the FPGA also\noutputs power data from each receiver, which is equivalent to\n16 wide-beam riometer outputs. For debugging purposes the\ninput values for the power computation can be selected from\none of several locations in the signal processing chain; before\nthe dc offset removal stage, or after the dc offset removal, gain\nor tapering stages. A completely new feature is the inclusion\nof raw data recording, with a memory depth of 4094 samples\nrecorded each second. This memory can be assigned to record\nfrom one receiver or split between two and operates in parallel\nto the normal beam-formed data.

These refinements permit eas-\nier operation in remote locations; during installation of the\nsystem at Maitri, Antarctica it was discovered that one re-\nceiver module was not operating correctly, affecting data from\ntwo antennas. System testing carried out remotely from Lan-\ncaster, UK, indicated that the most likely fault was a local os-\ncillator cable having worked loose during transit, which was\nconfirmed when the back panel was removed. Hence, these re-\nfinements have proven extremely useful for fault recognition\nand remote operation.\nV. BEAM FORMING AND VALIDATION\nThe beam projection for the ARIES Mills cross system\nis given in Fig. 8. Figures 9 and 10 show the beam projection\nfrom the 8 \u00d7 8 and 4 \u00d7 4 filled array systems, respectively.\nIn all cases the field of view is approximately the same, 200\n\u00d7 200 km, and the beams are numbered row by row, starting\nfrom 1 in the NE corner.\nThe validity of the beam-forming process can be con-\nfirmed by comparing the received signal power from cosmic\nradio sources with the expected profile calculated using the\ntheoretical antenna response. Provided that the beam-forming\nprocess is correct and the beam points in the correct direction,\nthen the profiles of the measured and modeled radio source\nsignal powers, including the timing of the maxima, will\nagree. Pointing errors which move the beam directly toward\nor away from the point where the radio source is closest to\nthe beam center will not affect the timing of the maxima but\nthe measured power level will not match the modeled value,\nother pointing errors will affect both the measured power\nlevel and the timing of the maxima.\nFor riometers located in the northern hemisphere the\nradio source Cassiopeia A was used and for Maitri in the\n\u2212150 \u2212100 \u221250 0 50 100 150\n\u2212150\n\u2212100\n\u221250\n0\n50\n100\n150\ndistance (km)\ndi\nst\nan\nce\n (k\nm)\nFIG. 8.

The large circle shows the wide-beam riometer field of\nview. The 16 imaging beams are numbered.\nthose beams we have estimated the radio source signal power\nby subtracting the background noise power obtained from a\nlinear fit between the times when the radio source enters and\nleaves the \u201320 dB gain contour of the main antenna lobe. The\nradio source signal power calculation assumes that the diffuse\ncosmic background (i.e., excluding the contribution from\nthe radio source) varies linearly in the region surrounding\nthe radio source; the validity of this assumption decreases as\nthe beam width increases. To avoid problems arising from\nionospheric scintillation the power values are taken from\nquiet day curves which were created using a method similar\nto that described by Browne, Hargreaves, and Honary.13\nTo confirm the validity of the method we present the re-\nsults obtained for the IRIS system at Kilpisj\u00e4rvi (Fig. 11),\nwhich uses analog Butler matrices. The figure shows 12 pan-\nels, one for each of the beams through which Cassiopeia A\npasses. The beam number is displayed in the lower left-hand\ncorner of each panel. The x-axis represents time and on each\npanel the x-axis limits differ and are chosen to highlight the\npassage of the radio source through the beam. On the y-axis\nthe radio source power is displayed (in decibels), relative to\nthe power that would be received if the radio source were to\npass through the center of the zenithal beam or the beam clos-\nest to the zenith for those systems without a zenithal beam.\nThe y-axis scaling is identical for all panels (\u221220 to 0 dB).\nTo account for the unknown system gain the recorded radio\nsource signal powers have all been scaled by a common fac-\ntor to provide the best fit against the modeled signal powers.\nFrom Fig. 11 it can be seen that there is good agreement be-\ntween the measured and modeled signal powers and, in partic-\nular, with the times of the maxima. The minor discrepancies\nin signal powers we ascribe to errors in removing the cos-\nmic background level. The analysis of the Kilpisj\u00e4rvi IRIS\nsystem assumes an untapered system; in practice, a small de-\ngree of tapering exists due to unequal losses from the differ-\nent antenna cable lengths. A similar beam-forming validation\nmethod is used by Senior et al.30\nFigure 12 shows the modeled and measured radio source\nsignal powers for ARIES; from the excellent agreement, we\ndeduce that the beam-forming process is working correctly.\nThe results for AIRIS (Fig. 13) show good agreement, errors\nare of similar magnitude to the results seen for the Kilpisj\u00e4rvi\nIRIS system. The results for the Maitri system, Fig. 14, show\ngood agreement for beams 2, 3, 5, and 8. The results for beams\n1 and 4 appear less convincing; however, the radio source\npasses close to the edge of these beams where the change in\ngain is most severe, so that small errors have a large effect\non signal power (>1 dB per degree at the theoretical loca-\ntions). It should also be remembered that the beams in the\n4 \u00d7 4 system are larger and that the validity of the assump-\ntion of linearly varying cosmic noise background decreases\nas beam size increases. We believe these results show that the\ndigital beam-forming process is working correctly for all sys-\ntem configurations.\nVI.

(AIRIS denotes And\u00f8ya Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric\nStudies.)\nThe signal-to-noise ratio has been measured from five\ndifferent riometers using the same method; for each beam\nthe ratio of the mean to standard deviation (using detrended\ndata) in a 15 min sliding window over an entire day was com-\nputed and the lowest value recorded in order to eliminate any\npossible adverse effects from scintillation. The median of the\nper-beam SNR values is then used as the system signal-to-\nnoise ratio. The results are given in Table I. As validation of\nthe SNR measurements it can be seen that the measured preci-\nsion of the IRIS riometer system at Kilpisj\u00e4rvi is only slightly\nless than that can be achieved theoretically.\nTheoretical calculations of the SNR performance of a\nMills cross system by Hagfors, Grill, and Honary24 suggested\nthat the time\u2013bandwidth product must be increased by a fac-\ntor of 100\u2013900 compared to a filled array for similar per-\nformance to be achieved. The bandwidth\u2013time product for\nARIES is just over 50 times greater than that for IRIS; how-\never, the absence of noise balancing in ARIES results in an\neffective increase of just over 100 times. Thus the measure-\nment precision of ARIES is predicted to be comparable to that\nof IRIS.\nNielsen, Honary, and Grill23 gave an equation for the ex-\npected signal-to-noise ratio for a Mills cross system.

The contribution to the received power\nfrom Sagittarius A* is shown by solid lines, the modeled values are shown by dashed lines.\nmeasured value for ARIES is better than this, 0.045 dB. This\nis possible because the assumptions of even cosmic back-\nground and equal antenna gain for each subdivision are not\ncorrect; certain combinations of fan beams and sidereal times\ncan result in a stronger signal appearing in the intersecting re-\ngion compared to the nonintersecting parts of the fan beams,\nresulting in a higher SNR than predicted.\nThe motivation for creating a filled phased array sys-\ntem with digital beam forming was to improve the measure-\nment precision compared to the existing riometers. Table I\nshows that for AIRIS the theoretical precision, 0.0089 dB, is\nnearly five times better than any other system operating with a\n1 s cadence and also better than the PENGUIN IRIS system\noperating at 12 s cadence. Comparable noise performance\nfrom an IRIS system would require that the data be post-\nintegrated to 25 s cadence. The performance increase arises in\npart from the enlarged bandwidth (25% increase), the absence\nof noise balancing, but mostly from the much larger integra-\ntion time (10\u00d7 increase). With its wider 1 MHz bandwidth\nthe similar system at Ny-\u00c5lesund performs even better. The\n4 \u00d7 4 = 16 filled array system at Maitri offers identical noise\nperformance to AIRIS. Although it features fewer beams, its\nsmaller footprint enables deployment to sites which lack the\nspace requirements for an 8 \u00d7 8 = 64 antenna array, such as\nthat found at Maitri.\nIncluded in Table I is a calculation of how much data are\npotentially affected by scintillation, as determined by the loci\nof the radio sources Cassiopeia A, Cygnus A, and Sagittar-\nius A* intersecting with the \u20133 dB gain contour of the beams.\nThe susceptibility is largely determined by the instrument\u2019s\nlatitude; however, the riometer design is also a factor. Typ-\nically, only one beam at any time is affected by a given ra-\ndio source; hence, riometers with a larger number of beams\nappear less affected.

Instrum. 82, 031301 (2011)\nsuch systems mean that scintillation is likely to be stronger at\nthe times when it does occur, as less comic background signal\nis received.\nVII. SUMMARY\nA new class of imaging riometers, using digital beam\nforming, has been implemented; with modular hardware\nthe design can be easily optimized for improved spatial\nresolution or measurement precision. We have shown, for the\nfirst time, that a riometer system based upon the Mills cross is\na viable alternative to a filled phased array, giving improved\nspatial resolution and comparable measurement precision for\nthe same cadence and number of antennas when compared\nto existing analog imaging riometers. The higher spatial\nresolution achieved by ARIES has resulted in a number of\nimportant scientific discoveries, as described in Sec. II D.\nWe have also shown that a filled phased array system\nutilizing digital beam forming with independent receivers for\neach antenna can provide much better measurement precision\ncompared to existing imaging riometers using analog But-\nler matrices. Improved measurement precision is useful for\nvarious scientific studies, e.g., in order to measure the solar-\ncontrolled absorption.\nThe digital implementation allows a number of improve-\nments to be easily incorporated. For system testing and diag-\nnosis the FPGA can be reconfigured so that outputs from each\nantenna\/receiver can be viewed either as integrated 1 s data or\nas raw data samples. As physical access is not required this\nsimplifies operation in harsh and remote environments such\nas the Arctic and Antarctic. In the latest software version,\nas deployed to Maitri, this functionality is part of the stan-\ndard FPGA program so that some testing is possible without\ndisturbing normal data recording, as well as providing wide-\nbeam riometer data.\nFurther improvements with a digital beam-forming\napproach are possible. For instance, it is possible to im-\nplement both modified and nonmodified Butler matrix\ndesigns simultaneously in order to obtain overlapping beam\nradiation patterns for higher spatial resolution. Alternatively,\nby computing and recording the cross-products any beam\narrangement could be obtained by postprocessing of the data.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are deeply indebted to the late Tor Hagfors, who pro-\nvided invaluable advice and input, especially during his three-\nmonth visit to Lancaster University made possible through a\nRoyal Society Visiting Fellowship.
