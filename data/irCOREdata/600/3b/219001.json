Mediterranean Crossings \nfocuses on the five hundred years from the early sixteenth century to the present:  the \nperiod which marks the emergence and development of \u2018cartographies of power and \nknowledge that charted European expansion on a planetary scale\u2019 (p.2).  In this \nrespect the Mediterranean exemplifies global patterns of shared encounter, \ncolonialism, trade and imperial ambition.  Readers should not expect, however, a \nlinear narrative or an exhaustive account of cultural encounters across the region.  \nInstead, Chambers investigates what he calls the \u2018liquid materiality\u2019 of the area:  the \nways in which \u2018overlapping territories and intertwined histories\u2019 suggest \u2018the making \nof a more multiple Mediterranean\u2019, where borders are \u2018both transitory and zones of \ntransit\u2019 (p.3-5).  The purpose here is to cut through so-called \u2018thickets of \nprovincialism\u2019; in other words, to escape the narrow and restrictive identity politics of \nmodern nationalism.  Chambers is interested in the \u2018visible and invisible networks\u2019 \nbetween cultures and is scathing about the artificial separation of those connections by \nideological and literal borders.  In making this case, he employs a very wide range of \nmaterial, though some of the discussions are regrettably brief.  Among the eclectic \ntopics mentioned are:  thirteenth-century Jewish merchants; the Mediterranean slave \ntrade; the Crusades; the Algerian novelist Assia Djebar; Neapolitan popular music; \nMediterranean cuisine; the politics of the veil; the evolution of the Arabic \u2018oud into \nthe lute and the guitar; Caravaggio; rubbish collection and the Camorra; and, \ncrucially, the occlusion of Muslim culture from modern ideas about Europe.  One of \nthe book\u2019s declared projects is to challenge received understandings of European \ncultural history by questioning the comfortable certainties of classicism, nationalism, \nand relentless \u2018progress\u2019 (p. 40). \n \nChambers is a professor of postcolonial studies and this specialism allows him to \nreposition the Mediterranean in terms of what \u2018the West\u2019 has \u2018marginalised, culturally \nrepressed [and] physically (and metaphysically) eradicated\u2019 (p. 26).  Occasionally, \nhowever, Chambers\u2019s arguments close down more sophisticated understandings of \ncultural encounter.  He generalises very readily about \u2018the West\u2019, and sometimes uses \nthe terms \u2018First World\u2019, \u2018Occidental\u2019, \u2018European\u2019 and \u2018modern state\u2019 apparently \ninterchangeably.  He mentions, for example, the \u2018global imminence of Occidental \nwhiteness\u2019 and the \u2018essential violence on which the authority of the modern state \ndepends to secure its legitimacy\u2019, specifically law courts, policing and education (p.5).  \nThese statements are methodologically problematic because they simplify or suppress \nmore complex cultural interactions.  Not only do they assume that \u2018the West\u2019 has been \nand remains homogenous, but they further assert that Western modernity is always \nand everywhere characterised by violent oppression, an idea which makes cultural \nencounters uncomfortably formulaic and shuts down other interpretative possibilities.  \nChambers argues, for instance, that Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Egypt exemplifies the \n\u2018civilising mission\u2019 with which \u2018Europe has taken possession of the rest of the world\u2019 \n(p.12).  In some respects this is persuasive, but it also implies that cultural encounters \nand influences flow only in one direction, from a homogenous and appropriative \n\u2018Occident\u2019 to an equally uniform but passive \u2018Orient\u2019.  This risks oversimplification:  \nNapoleon, after all, also \u2018laid claim\u2019 to Roman and Carolingian history with his \nEuropean invasions and propaganda.  Furthermore, Egypt was itself a rebellious \nprovince of the Ottoman Empire; the ruling Marmelukes had declared independence \nin 1786 before struggling bitterly against a Turkish army sent to recapture the \nterritory.  Napoleon\u2019s invasion certainly reveals an imperialist purpose, but it is also \npart of multi-faceted encounters between various transnational empires, colonised \nplaces, and different cultures in the Mediterranean.  His proclamation to the people of \nEgypt, for example, mixes French Revolutionary and Islamic political language and \nthus exhibits a form of cultural interaction even at the moment of colonial \nappropriation. \n \nThe excellent chapter on Naples, however, avoids these problems by showing how \ndifferent cultural traditions interact and morph in specific contexts.  Naples, Chambers \nsays, is a place \u2018of innumerable invasions and incursions\u2019 which \u2018embodies and \nincorporates foreign elements\u2019 while maintaining its initial form (p.81).  This is the \nhighlight of the book:  Chambers illustrates the fluid malleability of cultures and \nhistories, while simultaneously remaining grounded in the local and the concrete.  He \nusefully describes the Mediterranean, and the places within it, as \u2018composite \nlocalities\u2019, made unique by the wider negotiations of cultural encounters.  \n \nPaul Stock \nSchool of English and Humanities \nBirkbeck, University of London     \n"}
