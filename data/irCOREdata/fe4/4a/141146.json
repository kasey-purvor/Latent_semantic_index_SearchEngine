INTRODUCTION303\n304\nModern waste management, whilst advocating avoidance and minimisation of waste305\nproduction, has strong focus on recycling and recovery. However, even with the most306\nsuccessful source separation schemes, there remains a significant quantity of residual waste.307\nInternationally, mechanical biological treatment (MBT) technologies are being adopted for308\ntreating this residual waste1-7. Interest has been strongest in Germany8, 9, Austria10, 11, Italy309\nand Spain, with other countries starting to follow; for example, the UK12-14, France15,310\nGreece16 and Portugal17. MBT is also a potential option for environmentally developing311\ncountries18, 19: e.g. Brazil20, south-east Asia21 and China22.312\n14\nThis review provides an account of MBT plants that produce RDF\/SRF from municipal313\nsolid waste (MSW), focusing on material flow and performance. The review complements a314\nrecently published assessment of the generic aspects of MBT5, and is timely because MBT315\nplants are increasingly adopted in Europe to help meet landfill diversion targets. We provide316\nan assessment of the science and process technology of MBT, including the performance of317\nunit processes within MBT plants, so that waste managers, regulators and policy makers can318\nassess the strategic contribution that MBT can make to sustainable waste management. The319\nuse of terminology in this field, especially pertaining to fuels, is clarified. An assessment of320\nthe policy-related aspects of MBT and SRF adoption is made elsewhere23.321\nMBT technologies were developed in Germany and Italy, with the first plants established322\nca. 1995. Similar systems exist, to a lesser extent, in Australia and the US. Over the last 15323\nyears, a considerable capacity of MBT has been installed within Europe6, 7. In Germany,324\nmore than 6.35 million tonnes of residual waste are treated through MBT plants per year9.325\nThis is largely a response to the European Union (EU) Landfill Directive (LFD)326\n(99\/31\/EC)24. The LFD requires a phased reduction in the amount of biodegradable waste327\ndisposed of to landfill, because of its potential to produce landfill gas and leachate.328\nA fundamental question is: how does MBT serve the need for the effective management329\nof material flows, as an integral part of sustainable resource management? Elemental and330\nbiological composition is the critical factor for extracting value from waste, rather than its331\norigin 25. The EU thematic strategy26 has re-orientated efforts at recovery according to waste332\nproperties, and the challenge in exploiting value is now in extracting homogeneous fractions333\nof known composition from heterogeneous matrices harbouring potentially harmful334\nbiological and chemical constituents27. Using process technology to secure relatively335\n15\nhomogenous output materials of specified composition should enable: (1) the concentration336\nof contaminants for onward disposal or treatment and (2) production of recyclate to a desired337\nquality, prolonging their utility28. MBT plants are designed for effective materials flow338\nmanagement. They use integrated mechanical processing and biological reactors to convert339\nand separate residual waste into output streams of suitable quality. Typical outputs include340\nbiostabilised material, dry recyclate, waste-derived fuels (WDFs), contaminated solid reject341\nfractions, and controlled releases to liquid media and air.342\nThe thermal recovery of waste through production of WDFs (termed refuse-derived fuel343\n(RDF) or solid recovered fuel (SRF)) has also gained significant impetus29-40. A significant344\noption for MBT plants is to produce a waste-derived fuel (WDF)5, 14, 23, 41-44. Alternative345\nprocess configurations, such as MBT plants optimised for the production of a compost-like346\noutput (CLO) to be applied on land, have been reviewed elsewhere4. The MBT-derived347\nRDF\/SRF concentrates the combustible, high calorific value (CV) fraction, enabling thermal348\nrecovery in a series of potential end uses, such as cement kilns and power plants23 as an349\nalternative to fossil fuels.350\nWe seek to address a number of key questions in this review. What is the desired quality351\nof such fuels and how can this be monitored through quality management schemes?352\nRDF\/SRF marketability is increasingly dependent on compliance with existing and emerging353\nquality standards45, 46. Different end-uses pose different challenges for the desired quality.354\nQuality management initiatives in Europe are discussed. This review also addresses how355\nchoices over mechanical processing operations (such as air classifiers and ballistic separators)356\nand their arrangement in the process flow sheet affect final RDF\/SRF quality. The design of357\nwaste processing plants largely remains semi-empirical47, 48 and limited modelling has been358\n16\nattempted. Published information is collated for the material management performance of359\ntypical mechanical processing equipment.360\nWhat descriptors and tools are suitable for evaluating the material flow performance of361\nMBT plants? Established approaches such as yield and purity are covered along with the362\napplication of material flow analysis (MFA) to MBT49, 50.363\nCan the desired RDF\/SRF quality be achieved by MBT plants? Previous experience in364\nthe mechanical processing of waste identified a limited ability to generate outputs of the365\ndesired chemical composition49, 51. First generation RDF production plants that operated on366\nmixed municipal solid waste (MSW) failed in both the US and Europe because of high levels367\nof contaminants and a high degree of variability in RDF quality49, 52. This failure is also368\nattributable to the prevailing economics that were driven by widespread availability of low-369\ncost landfill. The quality and yield of RDF\/SRF also impacts on the residual (reject) fraction,370\nwhich will determine the overall economic success of MBT plants producing RDF\/SRF.371\nHere, data available in the literature for MBT-derived RDF\/SRF properties are statistically372\nanalysed to reflect the currently achievable quality.373\nBiodrying is a form of composting that can be used for drying waste before subsequent374\nmechanical separation. Biodrying MBT plants are optimised for RDF\/SRF production. A375\nsignificant quantity of readily biodegradable substances is contained within residual waste376\n(ca. 68% w\/w in England)53. In biodrying MBT plants, most of the biomass content from the377\ninput can be incorporated into the RDF\/SRF, reducing the biodegradable material for landfill378\nand producing a partly renewable fuel. However, biodrying is a relatively new technology379\nand, despite having been subject to research and development54, 55, is neither fully understood380\n17\nnor optimised56. A separate evaluation of biodrying for RDF\/SRF production is in381\npreparation.382\nIn order to understand the science and engineering of MBT processes adequately, it is383\nnecessary to make reference to commercially available technologies. These are described384\naccording to the manufacturer or trade name. The authors have no interest in promoting or385\nendorsing specific technologies.386\n387\n1.1. Terminology for MBT-derived fuels388\nMBT output fractions intended as secondary fuels fall into the category of WDFs, also389\nreferred to as solid waste fuels, secondary fuels, substitute fuels, or alternative fuels. In the390\nabsence of a legal definition or universally accepted term, the two most established terms391\nrelevant to thermally recoverable waste fractions are RDF and SRF. Many other partially392\noverlapping terms exist and are discussed elsewhere5, 32, 57. Conventionally, RDF refers to a393\ncombustible, high CV waste fraction (e.g. paper, card, wood and plastic) produced by the394\nmechanical treatment of municipal or similar commercial\/industrial waste.395\nSRF is a recently introduced term that denotes a WDF prepared to a quality specification.396\nA technical committee of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) (CEN\/TC 343)397\nworks to unify the various approaches to WDF, providing quality management guidance.398\nAccording to CEN\/TC 343, SRF should be30: \u201csolid fuel prepared from non-hazardous waste399\n[as defined in Directive on hazardous waste (91\/689\/EEC); the input waste can be specific400\nwaste streams, municipal solid waste, industrial waste, commercial waste, construction and401\ndemolition waste, sewage sludge, etc.58] to be utilised for energy recovery in incineration or402\n18\nco-incineration plants, and meeting the classification and specification requirements laid403\ndown in CEN\/TS WI00343003\u2019 [now available as DD CEN\/TS 15359:2006].404\nRDF or SRF may originate from sources other than MBT, such as source-segregated405\npaper\/card\/plastic fractions. However, in this review these terms will refer to fuel produced406\nby MBT plants, and for clarity a distinction is made between MBT-derived RDF and SRF.407\nFIGURE 1 shows the relationship between different terminologies.408\n409\n<<Figure 1>>410\n411\n\u201cSRF\u201d is any MBT-derived WDF that follows (or can be reasonably anticipated to follow)412\nthe CEN quality management procedures. The WDF produced by biodrying is typically SRF.413\nThese processes are optimised to produce a partially stabilised fuel of consistent and high-414\nquality composition as their primary output. Such MBT configurations could achieve CEN415\ncertification when trading the WDF in third party markets. \u201cRDF\u201d is any MBT-derived WDF416\nthat was not, or could be reasonably anticipated to meet, the CEN quality management417\nprocedures in the immediate future. This might be any WDF produced as a co-product of418\nMBT optimised for different primary products, such as biogas from anaerobic digestion (AD)419\nor biostabilised output for landfill storage. Hence, we interpret SRF as a WDF following a420\nquality management; but not necessarily exhibiting better quality compared with an RDF.421\nHowever, because the quality management procedures relate to SRF production, much higher422\nreliabilities for SRF can be anticipated when compared to RDF. In the US, the term RDF has423\nbeen applied to WDFs of standardised quality, according to ASTM standards 57. The term424\n\u201cRDF\/SRF\u201d is used within this review.425\n19\n1.2. MBT characteristics, classification and design objectives426\nMBT is a generic term that encompasses a range of waste technologies. Most MBT unit427\noperations have been employed in predecessor treatment plants operated on mixed waste,428\nsuch as highly-mechanised in-vessel composting (\u201cdirty\u201d composting) and RDF production429\nplants. In its most advanced role, MBT is a material flow management facility that uses a430\nflowsheet of unit operations to split and bio-convert waste; processing the substances present431\nin waste into suitable outputs, and preferably, marketable products59. In this sense, MBT432\nplants are at the forefront of sustainable resource management, enabling a re-direction of433\nsubstances contained in the waste to the most appropriate intermediate or final sinks.434\nOverviews of the current state-of-the-art regarding geographical expansion, roles and435\nperspectives of MBT technologies are available5-7, 9, 41. Key distinguishing features of MBT436\nplants are5, 13: (1) the input (mixed or residual MSW) includes a biodegradable fraction; (2)437\neach plant integrates biological (e.g. aerobic composting, biodrying, anaerobic digestion438\n(AD)) and mechanical unit operations (e.g. size reduction, separation); (3) plants are439\nconfigured and optimised to produce an array of marketable outputs (secondary products) or440\nat least a stabilised biowaste (SBW) fraction, suitable for disposal in a final storage quality441\nlandfill; and (4) plants are enclosed and equipped with air emission control systems e.g.442\noperating under negative pressure and biofilters.443\nThe key objectives of biological waste treatment processes vary significantly. A444\ndistinction exists between processes configured for pre-treatment before landfill, and those445\nattempting to add value to the waste stream by producing marketable outputs, such as SRF,446\nbiogas, or a CLO27. When MBT processes are used as a pre-treatment to landfill, the447\nobjectives should relate to minimising the adverse consequences of disposal, including448\n20\nvolume reduction, biodegradability reduction to minimise landfill gas and odour emissions,449\nand immobilisation of leachate pollutants. According to Juniper5 one of the most important450\ndifferentiating features of MBT processes is the type of main bioconversion reactor (TABLE451\n1).452\n453\n<<Table 1>>454\n455\nOther approaches take into account the possible differentiations in the series of456\nmechanical and biological unit operations, diversifying between the terms MBT and457\nbiological-mechanical treatment (BMT)13. FIGURE 2 provides a schematic for different flow458\nline approaches to MBT plants. Distinction is made regarding the positioning of core459\nbiological treatment in the overall flow chart of MBT plants and the stage of RDF\/SRF460\nproduction. Alternatively, MBT processes can be classified according to their primary461\noutputs5.462\n463\n<<Figure 2>>464\n465\nMBT processes may be designed and optimised for the production of one or more primary466\noutputs: (1) biostabilised output, to be disposed of in landfill; (2) WDFs, such as RDF or467\nSRF; (3) biogas, for energy and heat production; and (4) CLO for application on land. Dry468\nrecyclates (ferrous and non-ferrous metals, aggregates, glass) are co-products found in most469\nprocess configurations. Products may be marketable subject to creating and securing viable470\nmarket outlets. If not, as is predominantly the case, they may render zero or negative value or471\n21\nend up in landfill. Biostabilised output is intended for landfill disposal: despite not being a472\nproduct, it has to meet quality criteria. Juniper5 provide an extensive list of potential end-473\nuses for MBT process outputs (TABLE 2). Most of them still have to overcome significant474\ntechnical, legal, and market barriers, if they are to be successfully adopted.475\n476\n<<Table 2 >>477\n478\n2. MECHANICAL PROCESSING FOR MBT479\n480\nA variety of mechanical equipment is used in MBT plants. Most unit operations were481\ndeveloped in the mining industry (e.g. coal and ore processing) and adapted for waste stream482\ninputs. Process units, such as hammermills and trommel screens, have been used for treating483\nmixed MSW e.g. for size reduction before disposal in landfill, recovery of a high CV fraction484\nfor RDF production and recycling of materials such as metals and aggregates. There is485\nsignificant experience of RDF production plants in the US61 and Europe62 from the 1980s.486\nHowever, in the case of MBT plants, these unit operations are fed with new inputs (residual487\nrather than mixed or source separated waste). In this section an introduction to mechanical488\nunit operations for MBT plants is provided with a review of the main waste characterisation489\nproperties necessary to evaluate the performance of mechanical processing. Emphasis is on490\nperformance relating to material flow management. Other aspects, such as energy efficiency,491\nor processing that does not change the final chemical composition of the fuel, such as492\npelletisation, are not covered. The main equipment used for size reduction in MBT plants is493\npresented, including operating principles and performance results where available.494\n22\n495\n2.1. The role and objectives of mechanical unit operations496\nMechanical unit processes change the physical characteristics of waste, so as to facilitate497\nremoval of constituents, specific components and contaminants from waste streams63.498\nFunctions served by mechanical unit operations in MSW include size reduction499\n(comminution), mixing and homogenisation, classification and separation (sorting),500\ndensification (compaction), and materials handling, including transport, loading and storage61,501\n63, 64. As-received, residual waste usually undergoes an initial mechanical preparation stage502\n(typically bulky item removal, bag splitting or comminution, size separation) before further503\nmechanical or biological treatment steps. Additional mechanical handling and processing504\nsteps can be placed both before (pre-treatment) and after (post-treatment) the core biological505\nunit. The throughput rate of individual processing lines of MBT plants is in the range of 20-506\n30 t h-165. In some instances, mechanical units form part of the core biological step e.g.507\nbucket wheels used for turning at in-vessel composting systems.508\nThe key objectives for mechanical unit operations are to5, 13: (1) prepare the input waste509\nfor the core biological treatment unit (pre-conditioning); (2) maximise resource recovery by510\nseparating out recyclable\/recoverable fractions; (3) remove input waste constituents that may511\ninhibit the effectiveness of further processing steps (contraries), or are inappropriate for the512\noutputs; (4) serve specific process control purposes as part of the core biological unit; and (5)513\nrefine the outputs so they are fit for the intended use. The processing objectives for each514\nfacility are site-specific and influenced by legislative and market demands for outputs.515\nJuniper5 provide an overview of the policy, legal, and market issues affecting mechanical516\n23\nprocessing in an EU and UK context. TABLE 3 lists typical mechanical operation units517\nemployed in MBT plants.518\n519\n<<Table 3>>520\n521\n2.2. Waste characterisation for mechanical processing522\nWaste characterisation refers to the quantities, composition and physical and biochemical523\nproperties of waste. A thorough understanding of these properties for input and output524\nstreams is vital for effective design and operation of MBT plants48. Important descriptors of525\nthe physical-mechanical state and behaviour of waste include, but are not limited to63, 66:526\nwaste material composition; moisture content (MC); density descriptors (e.g. bulk density,527\nparticle density, etc); elastic properties (material stress and strain descriptors); granulometric528\ndescriptors (particle shape, size and particle size distribution (PSD)); electromagnetic529\nbehaviour; CV descriptors; and optical properties (colour, texture). These aspects of530\nmechanical processing have been partially reviewed elsewhere48, 61, 67, 68. Barton69 provides a531\nqualitative review of selected properties for recyclable municipal waste components. Our532\nfocus is on the elastic and granulometric properties of waste.533\n534\n2.2.1. Elastic properties of waste and comminution535\nComminution (size reduction\/shredding) behaviour of waste depends largely on its elastic536\nproperties70. Schubert and Bernotat70 investigated the basic distinction between brittle and537\nnon-brittle (i.e. more ductile) materials during shredding. Brittle waste materials include538\nrubble, glass, cast iron and cast non-ferrous metal scraps. Non-brittle materials show little539\n24\ndeformation and high stresses in their stress-strain characteristics. These materials include540\n\u201crubber-elastic\u201d materials, elastic-plastic materials, and elastic-viscous materials. Mixed541\nMSW, residual waste and the organics fraction tend to exhibit predominantly non-brittle542\nbehaviour. Our current understanding of the micro-processing behaviour of non-brittle543\nmaterials does not allow these processes to be effectively modelled.544\n545\n2.2.2. Granulometric waste properties546\nGranulometric properties, such as waste particle size and distribution of waste components or547\nfractions, are conventionally the most significant descriptors47. These properties are used to548\ndescribe the performance of comminution and separation equipment, to model and simulate549\ntheir operation, for process control of biological treatment units, and for developing sampling550\nprotocols for waste characterisation and quality control. There is no universally accepted551\napproach to defining waste particle size, due to the irregularity and variability of waste552\nparticles. An overview of the possible types of particle shape, morphology, texture and553\nangularity descriptors, and measuring techniques applicable to the mining industry is554\nprovided by Pourghahramani and Forssberg71. Tchobanoglous et al.63 proposed formulas that555\nattempt to account for the three-dimensional, non-isotropic forms of waste particles by556\nestimating an effective particle size (de). Material-specific shape categories and characteristic557\nsize indicators have been proposed for waste materials, such as metallic scraps and shredded558\nplastics47. Hogg et al.72 discuss the role of particle shape in size analysis and evaluation of559\nmining comminution processes, through the measurement of an equivalent sphere diameter.560\nThere is a good understanding of particle size measurement methods. Extensive561\ninformation on application to fine materials such as powders is available73. A standard562\n25\nmethod for sieving waste methods has been developed by ASTM since 198574. Detailed563\nguidance on particle size measurement pertaining to SRF has recently been released by CEN,564\ncovering both manual and automated sieving for particles >25 mm75. Nakamura et al.76565\napplied optical determination and image analysis to enable accurate determination of the566\nwaste particle size, as well as shape factors such as aspect ratio (AR), roundness (circularity)567\nand sphericity76, 77. This method is potentially useful for modelling combustion behaviour of568\nWDFs and evaluating comminution performance. Nevertheless, the practical determination569\nof waste particle size through screening has encountered many restrictions47. For example,570\nductile materials (about 75% of MSW) can exhibit a significantly lower \u201cprojected\u201d particle571\narea, depending on the forces acting on them (e.g. a 1 m x 1 m piece of textile can be forced572\nthrough a 10 cm opening). The operating mode and performance of the screening apparatus573\ncan affect the results. Waste items may not move along the sieving surfaces as expected,574\nresulting in the maximum particle size passing through an opening that is less than the actual575\nsize of the screen. Furthermore, the wide range of sizes can cause fragmentation of the576\nmeasurement process78, producing results that are not directly comparable. For instance,577\nseparate size identification for items above and below a certain size, e.g. 40 mm, is not578\nuncommon47. Measurement apparatus and software is commercially available for the fines579\nrange, with the CEN SRF standard suggesting machine sorting for samples <25 mm, and580\nmore specialised methods, such as laser detection, for samples <1 mm75. However, certain581\nsieving standards do not cover oversized items, for example, the German mining standard582\nDIN 22019 (part 1) only covers up to 80 mm79. In addition, the particle equivalent diameter583\ncan be geometric or hydrodynamic\/aerodynamic, depending on the measurement method80.584\nFurthermore, the heterogeneity and high water content of waste can result in fines adhering to585\n26\ncoarse fractions and thus being measured as coarser fractions78. The CEN guidance addresses586\nthis by proposing air drying of SRF samples with moisture contents greater than 20% w\/w75.587\nAs a result of lack of standardisation and the technical challenges outlined above, a certain588\ndegree of improvisation on methods for determining particle size has occurred.589\nPSDs Y(d) (equation 1) have been extensively used in minerals processing, but have had590\nlimited application in solid waste management. The cumulative weight percent of oversize or591\nundersize, in relation to the size of the particles, is most frequently used47. Appropriate592\ngraphical representation of PSD data can disclose valuable information about the593\nperformance of mechanical processing and enable informed decisions on the configuration of594\ndownstream unit operations.595\n596\n63.2\n( ) 1 exp\nn\nd\nY d\nd\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf0e6 \uf0f6\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf03d \uf02d \uf02d\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0e8 \uf0f8\uf0eb \uf0fb\nEquation 1597\n598\nThere is evidence that PSDs for both raw mixed and shredded waste may be fitted, at least599\npartially, to a Rosin Rammler Sperling Bennet function (RRSB function)47, 81. RRSB is600\nsuitable for materials that do not exhibit a well defined upper size limit, but that can describe601\nwith accuracy the cumulative weight fraction above a certain sieve size. RRSB distributions602\nplot as a straight line in RRSB grid diagrams (or Weibull diagrams).603\nTrezek and Savage82 discussed the effect of size reduction, air classification and screening604\non PSDs of ferrous metal, aluminium, glass, paper and plastic. Ruf83 studied PSDs of the605\nmain components of MSW (unprocessed and comminuted) and provided a general indication606\nof the size ranges of comminuted waste constituents. Hasselriis61 described how with607\nmixtures of materials, such as mixed MSW, the RRSB graphs are determined by the relative608\n27\namounts of the materials and the degree to which their PSDs overlap.609\nAnother approach for graphical representation is the proposed method for analysis of610\nwaste deposited in landfills, stemming from geological applications84. According to611\nPfannkuch and Paulson85, logarithmic-phi units could be used, enabling the calculation of612\ncommon statistical measures, such as arithmetic and geometrical mean, median, standard613\ndeviation, skewness and kurtosis of the distributions.614\nTypically defined quantities in PSD determination are:615\n1. cumulative fraction finer than dx, where x is the percentage (undersize fraction,616\nunderflow) passing through the screen\/sieve with aperture size d;617\n2. characteristic particle size d63.2 corresponding to Y(d) = 0.632, in other words, the618\nparticle size that 63.2% of the cumulative fraction is smaller than (63.2%619\ncumulative passing);620\n3. nominal product size d90 (i.e., aperture\/particle size with 90 % cumulative passing)621\nor nominal top size d95, which can be used to define the product size of622\ncomminution process or the upper size of a fraction retained between two623\nconsecutive sieves; and624\n4. measure of uniformity (breadth) of PSD n, calculated as the slope of the linear fit625\ntrend in a RRSB grid diagram. The steeper the slope of the line, the tighter the size626\nrange of the particles. A narrow size range indicates finer shredding and grinding627\nthan coarser cutting, leading to a larger proportion of fine material61.628\nPSDs have been criticised as not producing meaningful results for solid waste629\nmanagement, because of the problems in size determination and measuring. Instead, particle630\nmass distributions have been proposed, which initial evidence suggests can adequately631\n28\ndescribe the distribution of unit masses (weight fractions of different materials)47.632\nThe size reduction ratio \u03b7dmesh (Equation 2) is a performance descriptor for comminution633\nunit processes. It is defined as the ratio of the mass of the comminuted product to the mass of634\nthe input material, given that the particle size of the comminuted product is lower than the635\nsize of the mesh and that of the input material is larger than mesh size86.636\n637\nmesh\nmesh\nmesh\nP d\nd\nI d\nm\nm\n\uf068 \uf03c\n\uf03e\n\uf03d Equation 2638\nWhere:639\nmP<dmesh is the mass of the comminuted product640\nmI>dmesh is the mass of the input material641\n642\n3. COMMINUTION PROCESSES643\n644\nComminution is a unit operation used to reduce the size of materials. Within the waste field,645\nequipment is generally refered to as as \u201cshredders\u201d or \u201cgranulators.\u201d Primary size reduction646\nrefers to comminution of as-received waste; whereas secondary shredding refers to further647\ncomminution of a waste stream that has undergone primary shredding66.648\nObjectives met by comminution include61, 63, 70, 87: (1) meeting (commercial) product649\nspecifications in terms of particle size and shape, e.g. compost standards or RDF particle650\nspecifications to suit the intended method of thermal recovery; (2) fracturing and reducing651\nthe size of particles to increase their biochemical reactivity, e.g. lignocellulosic material in652\nanaerobic digestion processes; (3) dismantling assemblies of items into their653\nsubcomponents, or cutting them into pieces, enabling separation of desirable and undesirable654\n29\nconstituents by downstream mechanical treatment, e.g. closed cans; (4) reduce the bulk of655\nmaterials for better handling or disposal; (5) disaggregating materials to enable effective656\nseparation, e.g. magnets cannot effectively remove metals from a mixture of other large657\nobjects; and (6) partially homogenising heterogeneous mixtures. For RDF\/SRF production658\npurposes, the combustible fraction should be comminuted finely enough to be easy to659\nconvey, store, retrieve, feed and air-classify61.660\n3.1. Size reduction in MBT plants661\nSize reduction is commonly one of the first unit operations in MBT processes. Secondary662\nshredding is employed during RDF\/SRF processing or to adjust final product size. Typical663\nmechanical unit operations that serve as the initial treatment step for the input waste, along664\nwith their operating principles are reviewed by Enviros13. Shredding has conventionally665\nbeen the first unit operation in most separation systems designed to produce RDF, but in the666\n1980s some systems that employed trommels as the first processing step appeared88. The667\nfirst biodrying MBT plants resorted to primary shredding of the as-received input, possibly668\nafter removal of bulky\/unsuitable items. The shredded discharge (e.g. Eco-deco: 200-300669\nmm; Herhof: < 200 mm or 150 mm) was directly fed into the biodrying stage. At the670\nNehlsen plant in Stalsund, Germany, after pre-shredding and ferrous material separation,671\nonly the underflow of a 65 mm disk sieve is fed into biodrying cells89. However, other672\nrecent approaches that avoid initial comminution exist. Eco-deco and Nehlsen use673\nsecondary shredding in the post-treatment stage, with Eco-deco using comminution as the674\nfinal refining stage to produce an SRF with the appropriate PSD, and Nehlsen as part of the675\nmaterial separation process of the biodried output.676\nIn MBT plants that do not use biodrying, but are able to produce a WDF fraction,677\n30\ncomminution is also important. MBT processes that use aerobic composting as the core678\nbiological unit usually have shredding as their first unit operation, followed by trommel679\nseparation (e.g. commercial reference sites of Biodegma, Horstmann, Linde, or New Earth)5.680\nDifferent size reduction solutions may be employed by other technology providers. For681\nexample, Hese uses a cascade-ball mill merged with a trommel; Sutco uses a crasher to feed682\na sieve drum; Wright Environmental uses a pulveriser, followed by a magnetic separator and683\nthen a trommel; and Wastec uses a bag splitter to feed their proprietary kinetic streamer.684\nSome MBT processes that use AD or percolation as the core biological unit use size685\nreduction equipment for primary shredding (e.g. Hese uses a cascade ball mill, and OWS686\nuses a shredder) or at the material recovery\/pre-conditioning stage that precedes the687\nAD\/percolation unit(s). For example, shredding is used by BTA and Grontmij. Shredders688\nare also used in wet pre-treatment processes such as Arrowbio and STB.689\n3.2. Process control and performance of comminution processes690\nComminution operations for the mining and food industries have been widely modelled87691\nand the PSDs from various types of shredding equipment can be predicted by computer692\nsimulation of the comminution process90. Mathematical modelling and simulation of693\ncomminution processes in minerals processing and in general have been summarised694\nelsewhere91, 92. However, modelling of size reduction in waste management processes is still695\nunder-developed. Van Schaik et al.93 attempted to model the recycling rate of secondary696\nmetals during shredding of end-of-life vehicles, drawing from minerals processing theory,697\nusing particle size reduction distributions and liberation as key model parameters.698\nSize reduction performance in MBT plants should be measured against their ability to699\ndeliver the desired output characteristics, which depend on the unit position in the overall700\n31\nprocess flow and the plant configuration. For example, primary shredding will have701\ndifferent goals from shredding for up-grading a final output, and different waste particles702\nsize ranges are optimal for composting, fermentation, and RDF\/SRF thermal recovery703\npurposes. Selective comminution can be beneficial for material flow management in MBT704\nplants, particularly when different categories of materials, contained in the size reduced705\noutput, concentrate in different size ranges. Each type of material tends to occupy a706\ncharacteristic range of sizes in the as-received waste61, 83, (FIGURE 3) and comminuted707\nmaterials with different properties also tend to concentrate in certain size ranges. This could708\nbe useful for separation unit operations, such as screens, to separate out fractions rich in709\ncertain materials63.710\n711\n<<Figure 3>>712\n713\nShredding can also cause problems, and trade-offs are inevitable in downstream714\nprocessing61, 62. Comminuted output PSDs and liberation\/concentration of certain715\nsubstances, or set of components within defined size ranges, could be used as characteristic716\nperformance indicators for comminution machinery. However, there is evidence that the717\nspread of waste component PSDs generally increases after comminution (FIGURE 4)718\nmaking classification on an item basis by particle size (screening) increasingly difficult.719\n720\n<<Figure 4>>721\n722\n32\nThe most important options for (primary) comminution are hammermill shredders, rotary723\nshears, flail mills and cascade-ball mills. Their operating principles, performance in relation724\nto material flow management, and results from MBT plants are discussed below. TABLE 4725\nsummarises their main features.726\n727\n<<Table 4>>728\n729\n3.3. Hammermill shredder730\nHammermill shredders are commonly used for MSW comminution (FIGURE 5) and are731\nhighly varied in energy requirements, and specific configuration (TABLE 4).732\nHammermill shredders, initially developed for crushing of minerals, are versatile in733\nprocessing different materials: from sticky clay to tough fibrous solids like leather or734\nsteel87. Their performance is specific to the input material composition and machinery735\nconfiguration. The important input properties are ductility, moisture content, temperature,736\nbulk density, and shear strength63, 64.737\n738\n<<Figure 5>>739\n740\nHammermills can be designed either in horizontal-shaft or vertical-shaft741\nconfigurations. Horizontal-shaft hammermills have a bottom discharge grate with742\nspecific sized openings. Shredded waste remains within the chamber and comminution743\ncontinues until it reaches the appropriate size to pass through the openings. Vertical-744\nshaft hammermills have a cone-shaped housing that narrows down to a throat section66.745\n33\nVertical-shaft hammermills can be beneficially fed with very-low density materials due746\nto associated windage64. The swinging hammers create a vortex\/fan effect (\u201cwindage\u201d747\ntowards product flow) that complements gravity in pulling the waste down into the unit748\nchamber. Grinding occurs more in the lower part beneath the neck section. The ground749\nproduct is usually comminuted to such a degree that no screening discharge grate is750\nneeded.751\nVertical-shaft hammermills were specifically designed for MSW processing, but the752\nmajority of hammermills in place use the horizontal-shaft configuration. A hammermill753\nshredder is a heavy duty cylindrical or tapered casing, equipped with a number of754\nhammers extended radially to form a rapidly rotating central shaft or disc. Size reduction755\nis achieved by the combined actions of impaction and tearing by the swinging steel756\nhammers. To avoid damage to equipment, hammers can be mounted flexibly on the757\nshaft, allowing for rotation over bulky or very dense waste components. Input waste758\ncomponents enter the mill from the top and move downwards under gravity. A759\ncomponent entering the shredding zone will inevitably be struck by the hammers,760\nimposing sufficient force to crush items. Size reduction is continued by waste being761\nstruck against stationery breaker plates or cutting bars fixed around the inner housing762\nwall of the grinding chamber.763\nHammermills are versatile, suitable for production of specific PSDs and for the liberation764\nof assemblies of parts70. Comminution of mixed waste by a hammermill shredder765\nsignificantly changes the PSD of input constituents, enabling subsequent screening of766\nselective fractions. Despite the spreading effect for some component PSDs, it can be767\nbeneficial for others. For instance, brittle materials such as glass, sand and rock form a768\n34\nhigher proportion of the fine particles range, compared with ductile materials, such as ferrous769\nand non-ferrous metals. Barton et al.62 provide data on selective shredding for UK RDF770\nproduction at the former Byker plant, showing the concentration of the non-combustible and771\nputrescibles in the <10 mm fraction (with the exception of metals).772\nHowever, a higher degree of size reduction is not always desirable. High-speed rotation773\nand impaction within hammermills pulverises materials, which may compromise RDF\/SRF774\nquality by cross-contamination62. Fine particles can become embedded in softer materials,775\nsuch as paper and textiles, contaminating these with unwanted substances. Despite the776\nbeneficial use of shredders for selective reduction, the shredding of highly polluted waste777\ncomponents, such as electronic equipment, batteries and composite materials, should be778\navoided, as it results in contamination of the less polluted items5, 49. If glass is contained779\nwithin the input waste, paper items may become laden with shards of glass that contribute to780\nthe ash content62. Additionally, fine glass particulates can fly in a subsequent air classifier781\nand become incorporated into the RDF stream, increasing its ash content61. The organic782\nfraction of MSW can also be contaminated with minerals63, 66. In addition, over-pulverisation783\nis not desirable in the case of material intended for biostabilisation through composting.784\nThe modelling of impact crushers for mining applications is long-established and785\nsatisfactory simulation has been achieved (e.g. Nikolov95). Modelling aspects of primary786\ncomminution of MSW has been attempted96, 97. The single most important parameter787\naffecting the shredded output PSD is the mean residence time (\u03c4), defined as the time a feed788\nparticle remains within the shredder. Testing results imply that a longer residence time could789\nlead to a smaller characteristic particle size. A smaller output product size can be achieved790\nby operating the hammermill fully loaded (choked). Selection of the size of discharge grate791\n35\nopenings in horizontal-shaft hammermills allows for more accurate control over the upper792\nlimit of the ground-waste overall PSD. However, tests on MSW commercial scale shredding793\nshowed a consistently unpredictable PSD for the output97, 98. Validation of the hammermill794\nunit operation of the GRAB99, 100 computer model of 1985 by data from UK RDF plants795\nshowed unsatisfactory results101. Parameters used were residence time, residence time796\ndistribution, selection function and breakage function, with the last two exhibiting797\nproblematic behaviour.798\n3.4. Rotary shear799\nRotary shears or shear shredders are commonly used in waste management operations,800\nincluding RDF\/SRF production plants65 (TABLE 4). Rotating knives or hooks rotate at a801\nslow speed with high torque. The shearing action tears or cuts most materials.802\nMulti-rotor types are the most common63, 66, with two or four parallel counter-rotating803\nshafts each equipped with a series of perpendicularly mounted disks with comminution804\ntools. Shafts are arranged alternately so that the rotors overlap and the cutting tools act805\nas scissors. Different types of tool geometry may be used, to allow for different806\nfeedstock and shredding objectives. In radial-gap rotary shears comminution occurs in807\nthe radial gap between the rotor knifes and the appropriately adapted stator, resulting808\nfrom shearing stress102. The cutting tools are usually indexable knives of rectangular,809\ntriangular or circular shape. In axial-gap machines the comminution process takes place810\nboth in the axial and radial gaps. The shredded output of radial-gap shear rotors typically811\nconsists of smaller fragments than the multi-rotor axial-gap, due to the greater number of812\nrotor knives, defined comminution geometry and the use of discharge grates in the radial-813\ngap rotary shears102. Particles that exhibit elastic-plastic deformation behaviour can be814\n36\nadvantageously stressed at low temperatures70.815\nFeeding devices (force feeders) can be employed, especially for oversized bulky816\nwaste and for radial-gap machinery, usually pushers, swivel arms, feed rollers, and feed817\nconveyors. The shredded output drops or can be pulled through the unit. In most cases818\nthe rotating shafts can be automatically reversed in the event of obstruction, resulting in819\nreduced down time due to blockage.820\nShear shredders tend to produce a more uniformly sized output and lower contamination821\nthan hammermills63, because of the lower rotation speed and absence of impact as a822\ncomminution mechanism. Hence, they are preferred over hammermill in RDF\/SRF823\nproduction lines65. The cutter spacing between the shafts can be adjusted, ranging from824\nseveral mm to cm. This may allow glass and other items to fall through the rotors without825\nbeing shredded66. Qualitative data concerning rotary shear fed with mixed MSW, including826\ntyres and oversized materials, showed that a ca. 5 cm cutter spacing reduced the size of glass827\nwithout pulverising it; and a ca. 10 cm spacing allowed several bottles and cans to pass828\nthrough the rotors and report to the output unbroken88.829\nLimitations of rotary shears include the production of a coarsely shredded output and the830\nneed to remove large steel and other durable items prior to shredding, as they may cause831\nexcessive wear and tear. Mathematical modelling of rotary shears performance is thought832\nby some authors to be virtually impossible, due to the large number of variables involved64.833\n3.5. Flail mill834\nThe flail mill is similar to the hammermill, providing coarse shredding as input passes835\nonly once through the comminution chamber. There are some important differences63.836\nInstead of hammers, comparatively thin flail arms, spaced farther apart, are mounted837\n37\non the rotating shaft, with their thickness ranging from ca. 1 cm to ca. 2.5 cm64. They838\nare usually single-pass machines, with the input material being shredded only during839\nthe passage from the rotor area, as they have no discharge grate. Input material is840\nstricken by the flails and smashed against the anvil plates on the inner side of the841\ncomminution chamber. Sufficiently small input particles can pass through the mill without842\nundergoing size reduction. Comminution of paper and card rich fractions is thought to be843\nbetter achieved by flail mills than by hammermills64. Another design variation operates844\nwith two counter-rotating shafts. Flail mills have increasingly being used for shredding of845\nthe combustible fraction in RDF production plants and as bag openers63, 64.846\n3.6. Cascade\/ball mill847\nA cascade mill equipped with grinding balls (or ball mill) is a type of tumbling mill, which848\nhas been widely used for mechano-chemical processing operations, from minerals processing849\nto advanced materials production (FIGURE 6)103.850\n851\n<<Figure 6>>852\n853\nRotating drums use heavy balls to break up or pulverise waste. Tumbling mills have been854\nwidely used for intermediate and fine reduction of abrasive materials87. In a typical855\ntumbling mill, a continuously or batch-fed cylindrical or conical steel chamber with856\ntampered ends, appropriately lined in the inner side, rotates slowly around a horizontal857\naxis, with about half its volume filled with a solid grinding medium87. In ball mills858\nmetallic balls cascade within the shell and centrifugal forces lift the balls, in contact with859\nthe shell walls and each other, up to where they lose contact and fall. Falling balls and860\nother hard substances contained within the input waste impact on waste feedstock,861\n38\nmainly whilst striking the bottom of the milling chamber. Pressure and shear stresses862\nimposed on the waste constituents result in differentiated comminution, according to863\ntheir physical-mechanical properties.864\nIn MBT processes they have been used for primary shredding. An early European865\nexample of a ball mill use is the Loesche GmbH case, operated from the mid-1980s by the866\nWaste Management Association of Kaiserslautern (ZAK), Germany. Another ball mill based867\nprocess operates on residual waste in Brandenburg. In 2005 a plant was under construction at868\nthe Nentzelsrode landfill to treat the residual waste from Norhtren Thuringia, Germany869\n(140,000 Mg a-1). In the UK, an 180,000 Mg a-1 nominal capacity plant that accepts residual870\nwaste began operating in Leicester in 2005106.871\nPerformance data have been published for the Loesche-Hese cascade mill106-108 and for an872\nOutukumpu-Hese cascade mill, similar to the Harding type, operated in cataract mode109.873\nThe attached trommel separates two output size ranges, namely underscreen (fine and874\nintermediate fraction, 5-40\/35 mm) and overscreen (coarse fraction, 35\/40-80 mm). For the875\nLoesche-Hese mill, the degree of size reduction is in the order of organic portion <876\npaper\/cardboard < plastics\/glass\/batteries < wood\/stones\/metals106. For the Outukumpu-Hese877\nmill, the order is organic portion < sand < paper\/cardboard < plastic films\/glass < stones <878\nvisco-plastic\/tenaciously plastic\/shoes\/rubber109.879\nCascade mill action has been found to have a selective effect on different waste880\nconstituents. Organic material is crushed or torn and disaggregated, whilst for wood and881\ntextiles the action primarily concentrates the coarser fraction (40-80 mm). Ferrous (Fe)882\nmaterial and batteries mostly deform, compress and become rounded at the edges, but do not883\n39\nreduce in size, whilst non-Fe materials deform slightly. This observation is in agreement884\nwith the wider experience of the behaviour of ductile, laminated materials in ball mills72.885\nIn terms of suitability of the output for further treatment, the two-dimensional886\ndeformation of non-ferrous material is beneficial for effective separation in eddy-current887\nseparators. Operators claim that metallic material is cleaned, enhancing its saleability after888\nseparation. Mechanical energy input transformed into heat flow after collisions in-shell leads889\nto temperature rise up to an average of 50-60 \u00b0C, resulting in grinding having a drying effect890\non waste108. Drying particularly takes place with respect to coarser, hydrophobic plastics,891\nfacilitating downstream separation106.892\n3.7. Other comminution processes893\nWith rotating drums, material is lifted up the sides of a rotating drum and then dropped894\nback into the centre. This method uses gravity to tumble, mix, and homogenize waste.895\nDense, abrasive items such as glass or metal help break down the softer materials, resulting896\nin considerable size reduction of paper and other biodegradable materials. In wet rotating897\nmills with knives, waste is wetted, forming heavy lumps that break against the knives898\nwhen tumbled in the drum. In bag splitters, such as flail mill or shear shredders, a more899\ngentle shredder is used to split plastic bags whilst leaving the majority of the waste900\nintact.901\n3.8. Comparison of PSDs of comminution processes902\nPreliminary results on the PSDs of various comminution methods110 allow ranking of the903\nprocesses. More intensive comminution (i.e. higher cumulative mass passing, d20) was found904\nfor ball mills ca. 68%; mixing drum; hammermill ca. 26%; and screw mill ca. 21%. Results905\non the size reduction ratio for primary and secondary comminution of residual waste in MBT906\n40\nplants were reported by Zwisele50. Results on comparative performance of different907\nsecondary size reduction of SRF for subsequent pelletising can be found in Porteous67, with908\nthe knife mill showing the best performance in terms of PSD (FIGURE 7). Vertical-shaft909\nhammermills can achieve a higher degree of pulverisation compared to horizontal ones66.910\n911\n<<Figure 7>>912\n913\n4. CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION914\nMechanical units for classification and separation of waste streams are central to the material915\nflow management of MBT processes. The appropriate splitting of input waste into outputs916\nwith desirable characteristics is a challenging task. Trade-offs are inevitable, and must be917\nresolved according to what is technically and economically feasible, satisfying both legal and918\nmarket requirements. This section discusses classification and separation units, emphasising919\nRDF\/SRF production processes. An assessment of the most appropriate formulas, descriptors920\nand tools for performance evaluation of classification\/separation units is included. Some921\nmechanical solutions of emerging importance are presented in more detail than conventional922\noptions such as screening and air classification.923\n4.1. Function of classification and separation operation units924\nSeparation and classification unit processes are used to segregate input streams into output925\nsub-streams with desirable characteristics. Output streams can either contain sorted desirable926\nitems, for example, paper and card in the light fraction of an air knife (termed \u201cseparation\u201d);927\nor can be separated out on the basis of their size, for example, fine fraction of a trommel928\nunder-flow (termed \u201cclassification\u201d). Possible objectives include separation of certain size929\n41\nfractions, concentration of certain materials, separation of fractions with specific properties930\n(e.g. organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), high CV fraction), and removal of931\nundesirable particles. From a material flow management point of view,932\nseparation\/classification leads to a redistribution of properties\/materials, enabling their933\nenrichment or dilution in output streams. The operating principles of separation\/classification934\nunits depend on the physical properties of the input waste materials or items. Categories of935\nequipment according to main operating principles are94 size (and shape) separation,936\ndensity\/elastic properties separation, magnetic separation, electric conductivity separation,937\nand optical\/image properties separation (chemical properties are also involved). Each of938\nthese categories can be further sub-divided.939\nTABLE 5 lists some types of equipment used in MBT plants. Pretz and Onasch48 and940\nDiaz and Savage68 reviewed operations of mechanical processing equipment suitable for941\nMBT plants.942\n943\n<<Table 5>>944\n945\n946\n4.2. Separation and classification processes in MBT plants947\nInput into these units is usually a previously comminuted waste stream, either sorted or prior948\nto size reduction. As-received waste can also pass directly through classification to avoid949\ncontamination of fractions by subsequent comminution, or because the separation unit does950\nnot demand a comminuted input, as might be the case for ballistic separators. Classification951\nas the initial treatment unit is common in plants that use AD technology, such as the Iska,952\n42\nBuchen plant; Linde, Barcelona plant; Ros Roca, Avila plant; SBT, Heerenveen plant; and953\nWhehrle5. More frequently, classification\/separation units are placed downstream in the954\nflowsheets. Most data refer to the combination of comminution and classification, such as955\nhammermill followed by screens or ball-mill followed by trommel.956\nOther typical functions in MBT flow-lines include post-treatment within biodrying plants957\naimed at separating combustible high CV materials low in minerals and chemical pollutants,958\nto form RDF\/SRF; pre-treatment of input material (comminuted\/not) for composting\/AD to959\nseparate out a high CV fraction and concentrate the organic-rich, contamination-free fraction;960\npost treatment of composted\/anaerobically digested material for CLO production; and961\nseparation of dry recyclate fractions, typically Fe and non-Fe metals and aggregates.962\n4.3. Performance evaluation of classification and separation processes963\n4.3.1. Conventional performance descriptors964\nThe performance of mechanical processing unit operations can be assessed in different ways965\nand by using various descriptors. For instance, considered as heat engines, the efficiency of966\nenergy conversion of machinery can be defined as the ratio of the useful mechanical energy967\nproduced over the total energy consumed113. Whilst a mechanical and energy efficient968\napproach is significant for both financial and sustainability considerations, we focus on969\ndescriptors appropriate to evaluate the material flow performance of MBT plants.970\nTwo main approaches are identified. The first approach stems from the mining industry,971\nwhere the performance of a classification of different size fractions is most important during972\nprocessing (e.g. sharpness of cut, selectivity). Klumpar114 discusses these aspects in detail in973\nrelation to the performance of air separators. The second approach originates from separation974\nof phases or fractions according to other material properties. As there is no uniformity in the975\n43\nrelated performance terminology, two clarifications are necessary. Firstly, in the literature976\nthe term \u201cefficiency\u201d is often misused to denote various descriptors of performance. Rather977\nthan accurately being used to refer to the ratio of effective use of resources over the overall978\nspent resources, it is used to describe the degree to which an operation is effective e.g. the979\nsegregation of items achieved by a separation process relative to the ideal. We take the view980\nthat the term \u201ceffectiveness\u201d should be preferred for the descriptors that try to measure \u201cwhat981\nis achieved vs. what could be, or would be desirable to have been achieved\u201d, similar to the982\napproach used by Hasselriis61. The term \u201cefficiency\u201d should be reserved for descriptors that983\nmeasure the degree of losses in conversion processes. Other relevant terms, such as \u201cyield,\u201d984\n\u201crecovery\u201d and \u201cpurity\u201d are clarified and they are discussed below. Secondly, variety and985\ninconsistency in the terms used to describe the outputs of classification and separation986\nprocesses often leads to confusion. The input (or in-feed) stream is split into two or more987\noutput streams (fractions). In the case of one main useful output fraction, which concentrates988\nthe desirable component(s) at the highest purity of all outputs, this can be referred to as the989\n\u201cproduct\u201d or \u201cextract\u201d or \u201caccepts,\u201d whilst the rest of the output fraction(s) can be referred to990\nas \u201creject(s)\u201d.991\nFor example, in the case of an air separator with only two output streams, used in RDF992\nproduction, the material carried away and separated from the air stream would be the extract,993\nand the other stream the reject. For these outputs the historic terms \u201clights\u201d or \u201clow-gravity\u201d994\nfraction vs. \u201cheavies\u201d or \u201chigh-gravity fraction\u201d, \u201ccombustibles\u201d vs. \u201cincombustibles\u201d, and995\n\u201corganics\u201d vs. \u201cinorganics\u201d have been used respectively. These terms all denote a principal996\nfeature, commonly shared by the items in the streams separated. They either refer to the997\nseparation operating principle (e.g. low-gravity) or to a desirable property of the stream (e.g.998\n44\ncombustibility, or organics). All constitute simplifications which if taken literarily can be999\nmisleading. To illustrate, the separation in an air classifier does not solely depend on density,1000\nbut on aerodynamic and sometimes elastic waste particle properties. The term \u201corganics\u201d1001\nreflected unrealistic early expectations from air separators and has been proven wrong,1002\nbecause the air separators cannot effectively separate organic from inorganic materials.1003\nIn the case of size classification into two streams, the terms \u201coverscreen fraction,\u201d1004\n\u201coverflow\u201d or \u201covers\u201d and \u201cunderscreen fraction\u201d or \u201cunderflow\u201d or \u201cunders\u201d or \u201cfines\u201d have1005\nbeen used. However, modern equipment typically has more than two output streams and1006\nnone of them may be considered useless (i.e. a reject stream), as they are part of a continuing1007\nmaterial flow management process, depending on their position in the overall flow-chart of1008\nthe plant. Hence, all output streams should be called \u201cproducts\u201d and, if possible, suitably1009\nidentified by terms that approximately describe their anticipated constituents. These1010\ncomplexities suggest that careful interpretation of the existing literature on performance is1011\nimperative.1012\nThe performance of each process unit should be evaluated against the role it plays within1013\nthe material separation process. No single parameter can describe all aspects of a mechanical1014\nunit operation performance. The most important descriptors for material flow management1015\nare defined below. The varying nomenclature that is evident in the literature is expressed in1016\nsymbols compatible by large with the MFA according to Rotter et al.49. Conventional1017\ndescriptors of separation unit operations performance are yield, recovery, purity, and overall1018\neffectiveness61, 80, 113-117. These are defined for the generic case of a separation unit with1019\nmultiple input and output streams (products). The mode of operation of the separation or1020\n45\nclassification equipment affects the results. During measurements effort should be taken to1021\nachieve a constant state of operation over a given time frame118.1022\nThe purity (cleanness or composition) evaluates the degree of contamination by1023\nundesirable impurities, or denotes the mass-based material composition (input)80. Purity1024\nC(CM)Pl is defined as the ratio of the mass of a component (or set of components) in the1025\nproduct over the total mass of the product (TABLE 6).1026\n1027\n<<Table 6>>1028\n1029\nIt denotes the mass fraction of certain useful waste component(s), such as the combustible1030\nitems, suitable for RDF\/SRF production, present in the corresponding product. An ASTM1031\nstandard covers the determination of purity121. The numeric values measured for purity are1032\naffected by the exact determination process that is followed, for example, with Fe materials,1033\nmanual sorting for waste characterisation or proximate analysis are both plausible.1034\nThe yield Y(Pl) of a product Pl is defined as the ratio of the mass (or mass flow rate) of the1035\nproduct over the total mass (or mass flow rate, respectively) of the input (TABLE 6). It1036\ndenotes the overall mass fraction, irrespective of its composition, which is transferred to a1037\ncertain output stream, and characterises the separation process80.1038\nThe recovery R(CM)Pl of a waste component (or set of components) into a product is1039\ndefined as the ratio of mass (or mass flow rate) of these component(s) in the product, over the1040\noverall mass (or mass flow rate) of these components in all the input streams (TABLE 6). It1041\ndenotes the mass fraction (or percent if multiplied by 100) of a set of components present in1042\nthe input that reports in a certain product80, 114. An ASTM standard covers the determination1043\n46\nof recovery118. In continuous processes, purity is easier to determine than the mass (or mass1044\nflow rates). Hence, the recovery in the typical case of one input, two products and two sets of1045\ncomponents (CM) and other-than-CM (NCM) can be estimated in practice through the1046\nmeasured purities (TABLE 6)80, 114, 118.1047\nThe minimum requirements to describe the performance of a material separation device1048\nare that purity and recovery should be identified118. However, the idea of combining1049\nelements of the above descriptors to produce a single overall performance descriptor is1050\nestablished. More than one total effectiveness formula (in the case of binary separation) that1051\ncombines recovery and purity can be found in the literature. Rietema113 reviewed the1052\nliterature for the definitions of overall efficiency E, and assessed them according to a list of1053\nmandatory and desirable requirements that such a formula should fulfil, proposing the most1054\nappropriate formula (TABLE 6). Worrell and Vesilind115 proposed another formula that1055\nresults in similar values. However, it has not been verified as to whether it satisfies the full1056\nlist of the requirements proposed by Rietema113.1057\nIn the case of size classification, i.e. screening, the effectiveness of the separation can also1058\nbe assessed through the grade efficiency (or partitioning, classification) curve114, 119. The1059\nmass based grade efficiency (or selectivity) G(dNF)Pl is the recovery descriptor of the portion1060\nof waste particulates of a given size (narrow size range dNF) into a product Pl (TABLE 6). It1061\nexpresses the mass fraction of these waste particulates of given size range that reports into a1062\nproduct. For example, this descriptor can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the1063\nseparation of a screen for a waste component(s) for which there is evidence that it occupies a1064\ncertain range of sizes after selective comminution or in the as-received waste.1065\n47\nThe grade efficiency curve is the plot of the grade efficiency for the consecutive narrow1066\nsize range dNF that input can be divided into vs. the waste particle size. The main portion of1067\nthe curve is anticipated to be roughly linear and determines the sharpness of cut. Sharpness1068\nof cut k25\/75 can be conventionally defined as the ration of the waste particle sizes that1069\ncorrespond to certain selectivity points, typically 25 % and 75 % (TABLE 6)114, 120.1070\nIn practice, performance descriptors cannot reach the unit. Composite items (e.g.1071\ncomplex domestic appliances) or composite materials (e.g. fibre-reinforced plastics) are1072\nconstituents that cannot be fully liberated during the comminution that typically precedes1073\nseparation and\/or classification65. Contamination effects are particularly important in waste1074\nprocessing, because of input heterogeneity and possible comminution.1075\nA lower than expected performance in air separation units can be attributed to stochastic1076\neffects introduced by solid particles that interact with each other or with process unit walls.1077\nAdditionally, unsteady air velocities occur122. These effects restrict the effectiveness of1078\nseparation. As a result, trade-offs are inevitable and isolated use of any descriptor regarding1079\neffectiveness can result in misleading conclusions about material flow management1080\nperformance113. For example, the above overall effectiveness relationships can be used in1081\nany separation process that sorts out two different output streams. However, in real systems1082\none performance objective may be more important than the other. The need for high purity1083\nof a product may necessitate a low product yield, or vice versa 61. Data from the SRF plant in1084\nNeuss, Germany, illustrated the inverse relationship between purity and yield44. Advanced1085\nprocessing with the objective of lowering the chlorine (Cl) content of SRF, (i.e. prioritising1086\npurity) resulted in a lower SRF yield. Overall efficiency formulas cannot allow for this1087\nvarying relative importance of purity and yield.1088\n48\n4.3.2. Mass flow modelling and simulation for waste processing plants1089\nThe need for an accurate and comprehensive picture of material flows within a processing1090\nsystem has led to the development of system descriptions based upon mass balances123.1091\nThese were particularly applied to RDF production plants. Diaz et al.124 developed a system1092\nof recovery transfer function matrices to describe each unit operation, based on waste1093\ncomponents found in input and output materials. Hasselriis, in a similar approach, developed1094\nspreadsheets describing the split of waste components into output streams61. For both1095\nprediction and design purposes, modelling of processing units and overall plants has been1096\nattempted. In the 1980s, Argonne National Laboratory in the US developed the computer1097\nprogramme GRAB, for simulating the operation of MSW processing plants99, 100. Warren1098\nSpring Laboratories produced a detailed evaluation of the software using data from the former1099\nRDF plants at Byker and Doncaster in the UK101. However, satisfactory simulation was not1100\nachieved.1101\nA recent application in general SRF production can be found in Caputo and Pelagagge125.1102\nChang et al.126 developed regression analysis models based on mass balances of waste1103\ncomponents and chemical elements (ultimate analysis) to predict the heating value of RDF1104\nproduct for a specific production line. Chemical composition models exhibited better1105\nprediction capability. Zwisele et al.127 developed the software interface and the initial version1106\nof a simulation tool of mechanical processing for waste treatment plants such as MBT. This1107\nincludes a material database of input waste properties, computing algorithms describing unit1108\noperations, calculation of flows, and quantifying the statistical uncertainty. Mass flows,1109\naverage material composition and PSD are used for each of the substance sub-groups of light1110\nsolids, high-gravity solids, minerals, ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals. The limited1111\n49\npublished validation data shows an acceptable goodness of fit; parameterisation was done1112\nwith empirical data of the specific plant and a stationary plant model was assumed. The1113\nauthors recognised that dependencies on time (residence time), capacities (load), moisture1114\ncontent, etc have to be taken into account in future developments and that the model has still1115\nto be validated with other case studies.1116\n4.3.3. Novel material flow analysis approaches1117\nMFA constitutes a systematic analysis of the flows (inputs and outputs) and stocks of1118\nmaterials both spatially and temporally as defined by Brunner and Rechberger25. As well as1119\nproviding a systematic approach, descriptors are adapted for combination with societal1120\nevaluation methods such as cost benefit analysis25, 128. In MFA, transfer coefficients (TC) (or1121\ntransfer factors) describe the partitioning of a substance into the outputs of a process25. The1122\ntransfer coefficient of a substance into a product is defined as the ratio of mass (or mass flow1123\nrate) of the substance in the product, to the overall mass (or mass flow rate) of the substance1124\nin all the input streams. Practically, TCs are equivalent to the mass-based recoveries of1125\nconventional performance descriptors, with the mass fraction of waste components C(CM)1126\nbeing replaced by the mass-based concentrations of substances cm(s) (TABLE 6).1127\nThe TCs can depict the partitioning of a preserved property, such as overall mass and1128\nabsolute element quantities, over the various output streams of a process. Generally TCs are1129\nsubstance-specific and depend on the input characteristics and the process conditions, such as1130\nthe unit operation design and operating regime. The moisture content of the waste matrix is1131\naffected by both bioconversion (e.g. biodrying) and mechanical processing (e.g.1132\ncomminution). Therefore, calculations or measurements of TCs should reflect this.1133\nIn addition to the use of TCs, Brunner and St\u00e4mpfli51 and Rotter et al.49 advocated the use1134\n50\nof material enrichment coefficients (MEC). The MEC (on a mass basis) is defined as the1135\nratio of the mass concentration of a substance over the mass concentration in the input1136\n(TABLE 6). MECs indicate whether the content of a substance, such as mercury (Hg), is1137\nincreasing (concentrating, enrichment, MEC>1) or decreasing (diluted, depletion, MEC<1) in1138\nan output stream of a process compared to the input. MECs can also be expressed on an1139\nenergy content (EC) basis, which is in accordance with the CEN approach to classification for1140\ntrace elements of concern. In another approach based on MFA principles, distributions of1141\nproperties of sets of waste components are plotted against their size range50, 86. The MFA1142\nframework enables an expansion of the description of waste processing units, plants and1143\nsystems beyond the conventional mass based descriptors of yield, recovery and purity.1144\nContradicting objectives such as high yield and low pollutant content require a quantification1145\nof recoveries49.1146\nThere is little published MFA-based experimental data for MBT-related SRF production.1147\nData is available for construction waste sorting plants25, 51, 129 and EfW plants130, 131,1148\nenhancing our understanding of substance flows. However, limited MFA research has been1149\nconducted on the performance of classification\/separation for MBT plants and RDF\/SRF1150\nproduction lines. Rotter et al.49 experimented with urban and rural residual waste in an1151\nattempt to identify suitable mechanical processing units for SRF production, in terms of yield,1152\nrecovery, CV and pollutant loads. Yield, MEC and TCs, reported on a mass and energy basis,1153\nwere measured for various combinations of separation and classification unit operations,1154\nincluding screening, air classification, ballistic separation and magnetic separation. Pre-1155\ntreatment was restricted to bag openers and removal of oversize items, without comminution.1156\nThis restricts the applicability of the conclusions regarding the current MBT configurations,1157\n51\nas most of them use primary comminution. Theoretical mass balance results from MFA1158\nstudies for German MBT plant variants have been reviewed by Fehringer et al.132. In most1159\ncases, the data reliability cannot be assessed, as results are based on theoretical models and1160\nassumptions derived from existing practical experience.1161\nThe combination of conventional performance descriptors with MFA related formulas can1162\nconvey a more detailed and accurate description of separation and classification unit1163\noperations, and mechanical processing plant in general. These descriptors of mechanical1164\nprocessing performance are summarised in TABLE 6.1165\n4.4. Performance of separation and classification units for RDF\/SRF production1166\nAlmost every MBT plant configuration is capable of separating a RDF\/SRF product. In1167\n1985, Barton et al.62 in a detailed overview accounted for the earlier phase of RDF production1168\nplants in Europe, covering plant flowcharts, mass balances and detailed operating1169\nexperiences from commercial references processing mixed MSW. Thom\u00e9-Kozmiensky1331170\nhas summarised both recent MBT and mechanical processing plant designs for RDF\/SRF1171\nproduction. For MBT plants a main distinction can be made between plant configurations45.1172\nThose in which production of SRF is their principal objective, which employ an initial1173\nbiodrying step coupled with downstream extensive mechanical processing; and those where1174\nRDF is a by-product of only mechanical pre-treatment, with the aim to optimally separate the1175\nOFMSW fraction for subsequent biogas production through AD or stabilisation through1176\ncomposting; for indicative process configurations see H\u00fcttner134. Additional variations with1177\nminor capacities exist. For instance the Nehlsen Stralsund biodrying plant (FIGURE 8)1178\ndirects the >65 mm pre-shredded material directly to the SRF mechanical refining part and1179\nmixes it with the suitable fractions of undersize which is biodried89.1180\n52\n1181\n<<Figure 8>>1182\n1183\nAnother possibility is the inclusion of dewatered and dried digestate residue from an AD1184\nprocess into the RDF product135.1185\nThe SRF output should be produced to a specification that is increasingly subject to1186\nspecific commercial agreements with the end-user, in addition to national and international1187\nquality assurance and control (QA\/QC) procedures. From the perspective of an MBT plant1188\noperator, this translates into three objectives49. The first is to achieve a high yield of the SRF1189\nproduct. It has been estimated that ca. 20-30% w\/w of the German residual household waste1190\nin urban areas and ca. 18% w\/w in rural areas, could be recovered as a fuel, without the1191\ninclusion of the OFMSW, after separation and possible drying losses49. Pretz and Onash481192\nestimated lower values of ca. 10-15% w\/w and Thom\u00e9-Kozmiensky133 estimated 25-50% w\/w,1193\npossibly including part of the OFMSW and before any losses. Experience from biodrying1194\nMBT plants suggests an upper limit at ca. 40-50% w\/w ar of input residual waste, if most of1195\nthe biogenic content is incorporated.1196\nSecondly the operator seeks to raise the heating value, compared with the plant input; and1197\nthirdly to reduce the chemical (e.g. volatile trace elements of concern, such as Hg) and1198\nphysical contamination (stones, glass, porcelain, ceramic, concrete, Fe and non-Fe metals) of1199\nthe RDF\/SRF fraction. In order to achieve high recovery rates for the RDF\/SRF fraction1200\neffective concentration of combustible particles, such as plastics (excluding long-lasting1201\nplastic products), papers and cardboard, packaging composites, textiles, and wood, is needed.1202\n53\nIn the case of biodrying, inclusion of the biomass fraction is attempted, with the possible1203\nexclusion of any particulates that fall in the fine fraction (e.g. <10 mm). Incorporation of the1204\nbiogenic content into the SRF can be highly desirable in an EU\/UK environment. It1205\nconcurrently serves the main target of diverting biodegradable content away from landfill,1206\nand results in a secondary fuel high in biogenic content, which in certain cases qualifies for a1207\nsubsidy as an alternative to fossil fuel derived sources of energy.1208\nAchieving high net calorific value (NCV) is crucial for RDF\/SRF marketability. NCV of1209\nthe biodried output has already been increased by removing a significant percentage of the1210\nmoisture. Mechanical processing can further improve this by separating out the1211\nincombustible mineral fraction, which largely constitutes of dry recyclables such as Fe and1212\nnon-Fe metals, and secondary aggregates (stones, sand, glass, ceramics, porcelain, etc.).1213\n4.4.1. Size classification (screening) performance1214\nScreening unit operations are the most established processing units in waste management136,1215\n137. They are used in MBT plants to sort waste particles, mainly according to their size.1216\nFrom the great variety of classification equipment designs, rotating drum screens (or1217\ntrommels) are the most widespread, followed by vibrating screens and disk screens68.1218\nTypical applications are immediately downstream of the primary comminution; or even as the1219\nfirst unit operation to exclude items from the primary comminution that do not need size1220\nreduction. They can also be used at many other process points. For example, use of1221\ntrommels to remove the fine fraction contamination (e.g. <10 mm) from the low-gravity1222\noutput of air-classifiers, intended for SRF production82; or for removal of batteries138.1223\nTrommels are reported as the most proven type of classification equipment, regarding1224\neffectiveness and reliability, especially with inputs high in moisture content, \u201cstringy\u201d1225\n54\nmaterial and with PSDs widely spread over both fine and coarse sizes68. A common1226\nperformance problem of trommels is caused by plugging of the screening media, especially in1227\nthe case of coarse screening. Material that fills and obstructs the openings can restrict their1228\neffective aperture size and reduce the mass flow rate able to report to the underflow48.1229\nAspects of the design, function and performance of trommels have been modelled1230\nempirically or from the first principles99, 139-142. Earlier theoretical attempts to predict1231\nperformance of trommels, such as the GRAB99, 100 model, have been criticised as generally1232\nunsatisfactory101. Empirical modelling of recovery of the input sizes fractions 20-40 mm, 10-1233\n20 mm, and <10 mm of mixed household waste to the underflow product for a 50 mm1234\naperture size trommel was attempted, through the development of a \u201cfeed-rate index\u201d. This is1235\ndefined as the flow-rate of the true oversize particles divided by the trommel cross-sectional1236\narea139. Model predictions were close to actual values when the trommel was operated1237\naround the specified operation regime; but at lower feed rates, model predictions were much1238\nhigher. It was suggested that the model did not account for the different characteristics of the1239\ncomminuted output upstream of the trommel.1240\n4.4.2. Screening performance without upstream comminution1241\nScreening before comminution (typically after a mild bag splitting unit) has been proposed as1242\na simple solution to problems caused by front end pulverisation, such as cross-contamination.1243\nHowever, research by Rotter et al.49 showed that simple screening as a first and single step1244\nfor mechanical pre-treatment before the biological stage cannot effectively separate the easily1245\ndegradable organic fraction from the high CV fraction. This is particularly evident for1246\nresidual waste that has a low initial CV and that is produced in areas with effective recycling1247\nschemes based on source separation. On the one hand, increased source segregation in1248\n55\nGermany has led to a lower potential energy based yield for SRF\/RDF fraction streams49. On1249\nthe other hand, other separation units performed much better in the same comparative test1250\nruns. One possible partial explanation is that for screening at 40 mm this could be1251\nanticipated; experience with the use of trommels has shown that significantly different1252\naperture sizes result in different sets of components reporting to the overflow. Coarse1253\nscreening at 200 mm concentrates mainly paper, textiles and film-shaped plastics; whilst1254\nscreening at the range of 40-60 mm, will in addition contain metals, dense particles and1255\nputrescibles139.1256\nHowever, in agreement with Rotter et al.49, Soyez and Plickert59 reported results for the1257\nCV of uncomminuted residual waste, showing that for coarser screening, the increase in the1258\nCV content of the overflow, was small: even for screening at 150 mm, the CV remained1259\nrelatively low, below 14 MJ kg-1 (FIGURE 9).1260\n1261\n<<Figure 9>>1262\n1263\nHence, Soyez and Plickert59 believe that a comminution stage may be unavoidable for the1264\nseparation of a high CV fraction, because no screen overflow of uncomminuted waste was1265\nable to meet an indicative German market threshold of 15 MJ kg-1. However, as Rotter et1266\nal.49 have shown, other separation techniques, such as ballistic separation, may be effective1267\nwithout preliminary size reduction.1268\nIn terms of chemical purity of the SRF product, Rotter et al.49 suggested that the1269\ninsufficient reduction of pollutants in the SRF product implies that PSDs do not correspond1270\n56\nwell to the distribution of hazardous chemicals, rendering screening unsuitable for selective1271\nremoval of highly chemically polluted waste particulates.1272\n4.4.3. Performance of comminution followed by screening1273\nThe simplest configuration for mechanical processing before a core biological stage of in-1274\nvessel composting consists of comminution followed by screening, as illustrated at the1275\nBiodegma, Neumunster plant and Linde, Linz plant5. A usual objective of this configuration1276\nis to separate a high CV coarse fraction from a rich-in-organics fine fraction. Organic1277\ncompounds present in the OFMSW can contribute to the overall potentially to recoverable1278\nenergy present in the waste and to the biogenic content of the RDF\/SRF. However, a higher1279\nyield for the coarse fraction achieved by a higher inclusion of organic matter may lead to a1280\nlower overall CV. The optimal compromise between the options should be informed by input1281\ncharacteristics and market requirements. Fricke and Mueller143 and Soyez and Plickert59 have1282\nexemplified the relevant complexities.1283\nSoyez and Plickert59 examined the performance of comminution followed by screening.1284\nGerman law (No. 30 BImSchV) sets maximum limits for the CV of waste to be landfilled to 61285\nMJ kg-1, and the minimum for energy recovery of RDF\/SRF at 11 MJ\/kg. An indicative1286\nmarket minimum, adopted for illustration purposes could be 15 MJ kg-1. From an RDF\/SRF1287\nproduction point of view, the revolving composting drum performed best. Energy based1288\nyield to the RDF output reached up to 48% w\/w for the 40 mm screen overflow, whilst CV1289\nwas only slightly below the assumed quality demand of 15 MJ kg-1,MJ\/kg. For the 80 mm1290\nscreen overflow, the respective values were 31% w\/w and slightly above the CV limit.1291\nDespite the highest CV values being reached by the hammermill and the roll crusher whilst1292\nscreening at 150 mm, their energy based yield was only 7% w\/w and 16% w\/w respectively.1293\n57\nThe combination of a revolving composting drum with screening at 40 mm provided1294\nacceptable results. The load of organic dry matter from biological origin in the underflow1295\nalmost doubled compared to non-crushed MSW. The slightly higher values reached by the1296\nhammermill crusher were negligible compared to the large difference in the quality of RDF1297\noutput.1298\nHammermill comminution followed by screening at 25 mm is used in the Linde MBT1299\nprocesses144. Results verified a selective size reduction, with maximum content in hard and1300\nvegetable matter between 2-6 mm; and in paper at ca. 10 mm. However, a low recovery rate1301\n(only 8-10% w\/w) was evident for the plastics to the overflow (>50 mm), used for RDF1302\nproduction107. The rest of the plastic mass, down to the very fine size of 2-5 mm, did not1303\nenable a maximum recovery of high CV material in the coarse fraction.1304\nKnowledge of the input PSD and the size ranges in which waste particles concentrate can1305\nenable more effective use of the screening units by informing the appropriate separation size.1306\nPretz and Onash48 reported on an example of successful screening (of unknown boundary1307\nconditions, e.g. type of input) after appropriate selection of the aperture size by use of PSD. A1308\n60 mm squared hole drum screen enabled the enrichment of OFMSW in the underflow and a1309\nfraction intended for SRF production in the overflow.1310\n4.4.4. Performance of cascade-ball mill with flanged trommel1311\nIn such process configurations the emphasis is on separating an OFMSW optimised for1312\nsubsequent AD or composting. The PSD of size-reduced output of the ball mill-trommel1313\ncombination is generally log-normal and does not strictly follow RRSB distribution. Results1314\nfrom Koch107 show that the cumulative weight fractions plotted in a RRSB diagram give a1315\nstraight line only for the finer ground materials, with an interruption commencing at ca. 15-1316\n58\n40 mm. Data for the similar Outukumpu-Hese ball mill case were compared to other1317\ncomminution processes coupled with screening (FIGIURE 10).1318\n1319\n<<Figure 10>>1320\n1321\nPSD results for the similar Outukumpu-Hese ball mill site were compared to other1322\ncomminution processes coupled with screening. The histogram of cumulative mass1323\nfrequency distribution (FIGURE 11) indicates that organic-origin material was effectively1324\nconcentrated in the <40 mm fraction, with less than 3% w\/w being above 25 mm106. Around1325\n64% w\/w of the organic material reported to the 0-5 mm screenings and 35% w\/w to the 5-401326\nmm fraction. Similarly, the 0-40 mm fraction, processed by a Outukumpu-Hese cascade mill,1327\nconcentrated 97% w\/w of the organic material contained in the input waste109. Operators of1328\nthe process claimed that compared with the size reduction achieved by hammermills, the1329\nfraction 0-40 mm contained lower levels of metals, inert material and textiles1330\ncontamination109. Recoveries to the 0-40 mm underscreens were plastics 33% w\/w, cardboard1331\nand paper 80% w\/w, nappies 80% w\/w, and textiles 4% w\/w.1332\n1333\n<<Figure 11>>1334\n1335\nKoch109 suggested that concentration of the maximum amount of organic mass in the fine1336\nfraction (<5 mm) could be favourable for the two fractions intended for RDF\/SRF production1337\n(e.g. 5-40 mm and 40-80 mm). Such a fine size range OFMSW could beneficially1338\nconcentrate the bulk of material that is high in moisture content. This stream would have to1339\n59\nbe adjusted to higher moisture content levels during the upstream aerobic composting or1340\nanaerobic digestion, whilst its separation could free fractions intended for RDF\/SRF1341\nproduction from unwanted water content. Advocates of such a process configuration1342\nconsider it to be more energy efficient than processes that employ less sophisticated1343\nmechanical pre-treatment and resort to drying of the total waste input for RDF\/SRF. Plastic1344\nfilms, paper and cardboard are distributed in the particle size range of 10-40 mm, reporting in1345\nthe intermediate output fraction (5-40 mm). As this fraction is intended for RDF\/SRF1346\nproduction it should not be finely ground. The 40-80 mm product constitutes ca. 25% w\/w,1347\nbefore separation, primarily concentrating wood and textiles, hard plastics, and metals. Metal1348\nand inert materials can be easily separated out.1349\n4.4.5. RDF production and optimisation of the PSD of organic fraction for1350\nsubsequent bioconversion1351\nOne of the important objectives of comminution in MBT plants that use bioconversion1352\nprocesses, is to optimally pre-treat OFMSW for the subsequent biological process. The1353\nOFMSW should be concentrated in the fines range, leaving the material in the coarser stream1354\nfor either RDF production, or for direct landfill disposal. The yield and quality of RDF is1355\naffected by the specific mechanical pre-treatment choices for the intensity of primary1356\ncomminution and the aperture in the subsequent screening. Conflicts between RDF1357\nproduction and optimal OFMSW bioconversion may arise.1358\nSignificantly different capabilities and restrictions for separation of the RDF fraction1359\nexist for AD and composting configurations of MBT plants. Much more extensive1360\nmechanical pre-treatment is necessary for the preparation of a suitable OFMSW for AD. In1361\nturn, this results in MBT plants being equipped with sophisticated mechanical processing1362\n60\nunit operations, capable of effective separation of the RDF fraction. However, as there is1363\nevidence that fine comminution of the OFMSW is beneficial for biogas yield and effective1364\nfermentation, an initial pulverisation step might be included, which could result in1365\ncontamination of the RDF fraction with finely comminuted impurities. MBT plants using1366\ncomposting to biostabilise the input for landfill disposal or CLO production, need much less1367\nsophisticated mechanical pre-processing and the need for size reduction of the OFMSW is1368\nlower. The objective here is to minimise the capacity of the composting unit and the yield to1369\nbe landfilled, which may necessitate complex mechanical pre-processing. However,1370\nobjective conflicts may also arise because some of the waste components could be included1371\nin both the OFMSW and RDF fractions. To illustrate this point, wood is of high CV, but1372\ncan also have a beneficial role in aerobic decomposition, functioning as structural material.1373\nLegislation stemming from national waste policies can specify the appropriate split of1374\nmaterials, in terms of biodegradability or CV implications for the final MBT outputs.1375\nSubstrate particle size affects (amongst many other parameters) the performance of1376\nbioconversion. For composting biostabilisation, primary size reduction is generally1377\nsufficient, whilst for AD an additional maceration stage may be attempted upstream of the1378\nseparation of the OFMSW, usually not affecting the RDF product. Many possible1379\nmechanisms exist, through various aspects of the bioconversion, which are dependent on the1380\nparticle size, shape and condition of the substrate. Generally, the objectives to be met by1381\noptimising the PSD of the substrate are to obtain a more extensive degree of bioconversion1382\nand to reduce the process time. For instance, in the case of AD these could be exemplified by1383\nachieving higher biogas yield, reducing the digestion time, and minimising the amount and1384\nimproving the quality of the digestate146.1385\n61\nOptimal size ranges for substrate particulates are significantly different for the anaerobic1386\nand aerobic types of bioconversion. Smaller particles are thought to be optimal in the case of1387\nAD, where size reduction through mechanical pre-treatment is able to accelerate the1388\nbioconversion, possibly through increasing the available specific surface147, 148; especially for1389\nsubstrates of low biodegradability146. However, the relevant mechanisms are complicated1390\nand the PSD of the substrate is not the only or necessarily the most influential parameter1391\naffected by comminution that may impact on the bioconversion performance. Another factor1392\nthat has not yet been investigated is the cutting principles (type of loading mechanism)70, 149.1393\nComparative results on the influence of different degrees of substrate size reduction pre-1394\ntreatment (shredding at 14 mm and maceration at 1.7 mm) showed virtually no difference on1395\nthe biogas yield of laboratory scale anaerobic digestion of OFMSW for organic loading rates1396\nfrom 2 to 5 kgVS m-3 d-1 110.1397\nOrganic material comminuted in a cascade mill exhibits a relatively large active surface1398\nand is optimally homogenised for subsequent AD treatment, compared with other1399\ncombinations of size reduction pre-treatment106. Further separation at d (mm) (d=3, 5 or 8)1400\nhas been proposed to provide a fine fraction (0-d) rich in organics intended for biological1401\ntreatment107. However, whilst a 0-10 mm fraction could concentrate around 86% w\/w of1402\norganics, a 0-3 mm fraction could achieve only an estimated 45% w\/w. This seems to be in1403\nagreement with the relatively low biogas yield for laboratory tested anaerobic digestion of the1404\n>3 mm fraction of residual waste, pre-treated with a Loesche-Hese cascade mill-trommel1405\ncombination, followed by flip-flop screening, in comparison to average values for biowaste1406\ninput108. A similar <5 mm fraction containing mainly paper and inert material in addition to1407\nthe organic mater, had a 30% w\/w yield and a characteristic particle size at ca. 3 mm109. This1408\n62\nmaterial flow approach biostabilises only a small fraction of the input waste (30% w\/w).1409\nHowever, the success of such an MBT configuration depends on securing markets for the two1410\ntypes of RDF that are produced from the 5-40 mm and 40-80 mm mechanically separated1411\noutputs (FIGURE 12).1412\n1413\n<<Figure 12>>1414\n1415\nOther typical MBT approaches resort to limited or different types of mechanical pre-1416\ntreatment and aerobically stabilise significantly larger mass percentages of the input waste.1417\nKoch109 showed that biostabilisation through composting of a fine fraction (<5 mm) after1418\ncomminution by a ball mill reduced treatment time to achieve the German legal stipulations1419\nfor landfill storage. This outcome is partially surprising, as optimal ventilation in composting1420\nis enhanced by larger particle sizes with a higher volume of void spaces. If structural1421\nconditioning did not take place in this specific process, the result might be explained by1422\nenhanced oxygen diffusion transport, anticipated for particle sizes of about 10 mm or1423\nlower150. Additional results from the Brandenburg Recycling Park Hese cascade-mill1424\nindicated effective biodegradation reduction by a short intensive composting stage (FIGURE1425\n13).1426\n1427\n<<Figure 13>>1428\n1429\nSilvestri et al.151 investigated the performance of comminution by hammermill shredding1430\nfollowed by trommel at 80 mm, with the objective of optimally concentrating the organic1431\n63\nfraction in the underflow for aerobic stabilisation, enabling in parallel the separation of an1432\noverflow with sufficiently low biodegradability potential, suitable for direct disposal. The1433\ninput was residual MSW from three areas (Trento, Zuclo and Iscle di Taio) in the Province of1434\nTrento, Italy, after source segregation of recyclables, including kitchen and green waste.1435\nResults showed that an overflow with respiration index lower than the legal limit of 1300 mg1436\nO2 kgVS-1 h-1 was not always achievable at 80 mm, possibly because of a high content of paper1437\nand card in the overflow, in addition to the organics (TABLE 7).1438\n1439\n<<Table 7>>1440\n1441\n1442\nThe authors speculated that screening at larger apertures (e.g. at 100 mm) could be1443\neffective in lowering the biodegradability content of the overflow. However, if the overflow1444\nmaterial was used for RDF production this would be counterproductive, as it would lead to1445\nhigher quantities of high CV materials, such as paper, reporting to the underflow.1446\nThe Nehlsen biodrying plant in Stralsund, Germany, has input of residual domestic,1447\ncommercial and bulky waste. A 65 mm disk sieve is employed to separate the pre-shredded1448\nmaterial into overflow that goes directly to SRF processing from the underflow that is1449\nbiodried; the finest fraction of biodried output (<10 mm, 27% w\/w of input) is further1450\nstabilised before landfill disposal89.1451\n4.4.6. Air-flow (or pneumatic) separation1452\nAir-flow separators (or air classifiers, AC) are typically present in RDF\/SRF production lines1453\nof MBT plants. Air classifiers have long been established in industrial applications, such as1454\n64\nagriculture and minerals processing, where they are used to separate components from dry1455\nmixtures61, 63, 80. In solid waste management (SWM) they were applied as a key part of1456\nconventional RDF production plants, operated initially on MSW and later commercial or1457\nsource-separated waste62. Expectations for AC performance were initially high but a phase of1458\nscepticism followed in the 1990s. This can be attributed to off-the-shelf applications of ACs1459\nproven in other industrial operations, but not adapted or optimised to waste, combined with1460\nunrealistic expectations (e.g. separation of organic from inorganic items, despite their similar1461\ndensimetric properties)61, 63, 153. Currently the confidence in the effectiveness of ACs has1462\nbeen re-established in practice65.1463\nWithin MBT plants, ACs are mainly used for concentrating the high CV combustible1464\nfraction in their low-gravity product65. Other specialised uses include the separation of a1465\nhigh-plastic film and paper fraction for subsequent material recovery, and for the removal of1466\nplastic from waste intended for landfill disposal in Germany, where legislative upper limits1467\napply on the CV of landfilled material65. Application of AC for compost product refinement,1468\nwith emphasis on the removal of plastics, has recently been considered, with limited1469\nsuccess154. Timmel65 reported a typical throughput rate of ACs after the preceding1470\nclassification at less than 15 Mg h-1.1471\nShapiro and Galperin80 provided a thorough overview of modern classification1472\napplications, including operation principles, features and performance parameters. However,1473\ntheir emphasis was not on waste separation, but on particle size separation applications.1474\nTimmel65 focused on residual and commercial waste treatment and an older RDF-production1475\nrelated overview can be found in Hasselriis61 TABLE 8 provides relevant data from Timmel651476\nand other publications.1477\n65\n1478\n<<Table 8>>1479\n1480\n1481\nIn typical configurations, separation is based on the differences in inertial (such as1482\ndensity) and aerodynamic properties (such as size and shape, i.e. measured as granulometric1483\nproperties) of the in-feed particles. Air flows through the in-feed waste mixture causing1484\nhigh-gravity waste particles (constituting the reject) to either fall freely or to be deflected1485\ntowards different chutes or conveyors. The low-gravity particles (being the extract) are either1486\ncarried away with the off-gasses, to be concentrated downstream in cyclones or fabric filters,1487\nor are deposited on spacious settling chambers. Up to 70% of the classifying air can be re-1488\ncirculated, in cross-flow designs48. Within mining processing, separation occurs according to1489\nparticle size80, however, in waste treatment the density-dominant separation is more1490\nappropriate and efficient117, 122, 155. Other sophisticated types of ACs have been developed1491\nthat incorporate additional material properties, such as elastic behaviour65. In residual and\/or1492\ncommercial waste separation, only gravity separators are used, and so far, centrifugal1493\nseparators have not been introduced. Cross-flow separators prevail, in which the classifying1494\nair flows perpendicular to the waste and deflects the particles at various distances65 (FIGURE1495\n14).1496\n1497\n<<Figure 14>>1498\n1499\nThe performance of ACs depends on the particular design, the mode of operation and the1500\ncharacteristics of the in-feed stream. Generally, for optimal separation the following are1501\n66\ndesirable65, 80: (1) sufficiently narrow particle size ranges in the in-feed; (2) constant, and if1502\npossible, isolated feed of the individual particles; (3) well-defined and stable air-flow and1503\nreduced turbulence; (4) pneumatic conveying through pipelines applied to the low-gravity1504\nmaterial; (5) separation of the low-gravity material from the classifying air; and (6) repeated1505\ncleaning of all fractions.1506\nHasselriis61 and Everett and Peirce117 summarised the research that preceded the1507\ndevelopment of pulsed air classification. Bartlett156 showed that the performance of a zig-zag1508\nair classifier is compromised at high moisture content of the input, and the amount of1509\nadsorbent materials present in the input was identified as an important parameter. The main1510\neffect was on paper density and agglomeration, although plastics were also affected and1511\nreported to the low-gravity product. The composition of the feed, such as the paper-glass1512\nratio, is also important157.1513\nBoth first principles and empirical modelling of the performance of air classifiers has1514\nbeen attempted, particularly outside waste management. For example, Wang et al.120 used1515\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of cross-flow AC performance for size1516\nclassification and Klumpar114 examined performance optimisation of air classification in1517\nclosed circuits with grinding. There is little research that is directly relevant to waste sorting.1518\nHowever, the principles for density-dominant separation through pulsed air classification are1519\ndiscussed in Vesilind122 and Everett and Peirce117. Validation of the air classifier unit1520\noperation of the GRAB99, 100 computer model using data from UK RDF plants showed1521\nadequate results for the raw mixed waste at that time, but different coefficients would be1522\nnecessary for pulverised waste101. Parameters used were air flow, particle size and density,1523\nshape, and coefficient of variation. He et al.155 showed that non-waste simulation of airflow1524\n67\npatterns within passive pulsing air classifiers can raise total effectiveness by 6-8% compared1525\nwith conventional ACs. Biddulph and Connor158 used effective diffusivity to model and1526\nevaluate the performance of low-gravity and high-gravity products for different duct designs1527\nof ACs, operated at high values of air\/solid ratio, reporting better performance for lower1528\nvalues.1529\nThe exact performance of air-separators has to be evaluated by pilot tests, as accurate1530\ndesign calculations are thought to be impossible because of the problems associated with the1531\ngranulometric description of waste particles65. The selection criteria for the appropriate air-1532\nseparation equipment include waste composition, particle size of waste stream to be sorted,1533\nrequired throughput rate and required performance65.1534\nRotter et al.49 presented a large scale comparative study on configurations of separation1535\nand classification equipment for SRF production for residual waste. This study provided1536\ninsights into the material flow management performance of ACs. AC unit performance was1537\namong the top performing ballistic separation processes, which include air knife and1538\ncrosswise. They achieved high enrichment in lower heating value (LHV) because of the high1539\nplastics percentage. However, this led to a high Cl content. Additionally, failure to1540\nincorporate the wet components into the SRF caused a high enrichment of cadmium (Cd).1541\nThese results indicate that for the purpose of mechanical post-treatment of biodried output,1542\nair-classification may perform closer to ballistic separation both in terms of yield and Cl1543\ncontent, as it would be less difficult to incorporate the paper, card and textile fractions.1544\nTABLE 9 reviews results on air classification performance.1545\n1546\n<<Table 9>>1547\n68\n1548\n4.4.7. Ballistic separation1549\nBallistic separation has a wide range of applications, including removal of mineral1550\ncontaminants from grains and nuts, sorting construction waste, concentration of paper and1551\npackaging material in MRFs, sorting of plastics160, conventional mechanical RDF production1552\nplants, and various roles in MBT plants5. Possible applications within MBT flowcharts1553\ninclude initial separation and classification upstream of the typical primary comminution step1554\n(typically performed by a trommel), removal of mineral and metallic contamination from the1555\nRDF\/SRF fraction (typically performed by air classifiers), and refinement of the biologically1556\ntreated output for landfill disposal, for example, to meet a maximum CV restriction, or for1557\nCLO production152.1558\nThe operating principles of ballistic separators depend on differences in specific density1559\n(densimetric separation) in conjunction with other material properties, such as elastic1560\nproperties (hardness), shape, and size. It combines separation with classification, resulting in1561\nat least three output streams. The waste components are separated by following different1562\ntrajectories as they impact on a series of parallel, inclined, metallic belts (paddle plates) that1563\nvibrate by rotating eccentrically and against each other (FIGURE 15)).1564\n1565\n<<Figure 15 >>1566\n1567\nFirst the low-gravity, soft, flat\/foil-shaped (2-D), particles (such as paper, cardboard,1568\ntextiles, plastic foils and bags) bounce or are moved forwards and upwards in a circular1569\nmovement by the rotating action of the paddles, reporting to the so-called \u201clow-gravity1570\n69\nmaterial\u201d or \u201clight fraction\u201d162. Secondly, the high-gravity, hard, 3-D particles (e.g. minerals1571\nlike glass and stones, containers such as tins and steel, wood, hard\/massive plastic particles)1572\nroll or bounce in a downwards diagonal reverse direction, transported to the so-called \u201chigh-1573\ngravity material\u201d or \u201cheavy fraction.\u201d Thirdly, in addition to separation, screening is also1574\nachieved by the use of perforated paddles that enable the small-size particles (such as sand,1575\nkitchen waste, dust) to fall through and be collected in the \u201cscreenings\u201d or \u201cunderscreens\u201d or1576\n\u201cfine fraction.\u201d1577\nVarying designs options enable optimisation of ballistic separators for specific inputs and1578\nobjectives. The main distinction can be made between one, two or three stage designs152.1579\nAdditional screens can be added (stacked on top of each other) increasing throughput and the1580\nnumber of screening outputs. Possible adverse impacts on performance aspects are the purity1581\nof outputs163, caused by material falling from the upper screens and interfering with the1582\noperation of the lower decks. Different types of paddle perforations (e.g. punched or net-1583\nshaped) and aperture sizes can be specified according to the in-feed material composition.1584\nFurther adaptability is offered by controlling the in-built adjustable angle of inclination of the1585\ncomplete set of paddles152, and the frequency of paddle rotation68.1586\nNo detailed modelling of the performance of ballistic separators was found in the1587\nliterature. However, there is a considerable difference in the density of non-combustible1588\ncomponents (stones, glass, ceramic, porcelain and metal) with densities above 2 g cm-3 and1589\nthe combustible components (plastics, wood, paper, textiles) with densities around 1 g cm-31590\n164. Densimetric separation could thus in principle be used for separating combustible from1591\nnon-combustible waste fractions for RDF\/SRF production. However, in a ballistic separator1592\nadditional physical-mechanical properties are used for separation and classification resulting1593\n70\nin the recovery of waste components not being based entirely on their density. In addition,1594\nabsorbed water may change the density of the waste particles, as is often the case for paper1595\nand card.1596\nExperiments on a two-step ballistic separator with horizontal first level paddles in the1597\naerobic stabilisation MBT plant at Linkenbach, Germany (treating residual domestic and1598\ncommercial waste) were conducted in November 2002152. The performance of the ballistic1599\nseparator was measured in the main air classifier role, aiming at the concentration of1600\ncombustibles in the low-gravity, >45 mm product, by directing minerals in the high-gravity,1601\n>45 mm product, with the parallel objective of enriching the organic fraction in the <45 mm1602\nscreenings for subsequent aerobic stabilisation. In-feed was the overflow of a drum screen1603\nwith round mesh at 100 mm, treating comminuted waste. In the first two paddle levels of1604\nballistic separator 45 mm screen apertures were used.1605\nThe low-gravity, >45 mm product reached a yield of ca. 77% w\/w, in which accumulation of1606\nthe high CV fraction was evident by the high recovery of paper\/cardboard (91% w\/w), films1607\n(97.2% w\/w), sanitary products (97.3% w\/w.), etc). However, the high-gravity fraction1608\naccounted for a yield of 13% w\/w with a relatively high LHV (9.2 MJ kg-1), resulting in an1609\nenergy-based yield for the low-gravity product of 83.1% w\/w. This was exemplified by the1610\nrecovery of some high CV materials into the high-gravity product, namely wood (46.0%1611\nw\/w.), plastics (16.2% w\/w), composite materials (21.4% w\/w), and textiles\/shoes (14.7% w\/w).1612\nAccording to the authors, this would necessitate a further treatment step for recovery of a1613\nlight, high CV fraction from the high-gravity stream. A high-gravity solid trap proved1614\neffective in this role, rendering a high in LHV low-gravity product at a 55% w\/w yield152. On1615\nthe other hand, most of the combustible components that were not satisfactory recovered to1616\n71\nthe ballistic separator low-gravity product (hard\/bottle plastics, composites and textiles\/shoes)1617\nare generally components of a high specific chemical pollution load, as indicated by Rotter et1618\nal.49. Hence, the current outcome, despite being partially detrimental to the overall process1619\nenergy-based yield to the RDF\/SRF stream, might be desirable in terms of lowering the level1620\nof chemical contamination of the RDF\/SRF product. MFA results for the ballistic separation1621\nof uncomminuted residual urban waste, with upstream removal of bulky items and metals and1622\nscreening at 40-150 mm, provided lower values for yields of the unit operation input to the1623\nlow-gravity product TABLE 10)49.1624\n1625\n<<Table 10>>1626\n1627\nIn the same Linkenbach MBT set of tests, glass was entirely directed to the ballistic1628\nseparator screenings (recovery 100%) in which the organic fraction was also concentrated152.1629\nAlthough this is beneficial for RDF quality, it would highly contaminate the organic fraction,1630\nfor non-landfilling or landfill cover uses. Organic content was largely split between the low-1631\ngravity product and screenings. A significant percentage of the metal content (63.8% w\/w)1632\nwas recovered in the low-gravity fraction. Effective separation of metals would demand1633\nsubsequent treatment of both the low and high-gravity fractions.1634\nIn a second Linkenbach MBT set of tests, ballistic separator performance was evaluated1635\ndirectly upstream of the primary comminution and compared with an existing drum screen at1636\n100 mm152. The three-fold aim was to concentrate the RDF-intended fraction in the low-1637\ngravity product, achieve high recovery of minerals and metals in the low-gravity product and1638\nseparate an OFMSW of low LHV in the screenings. In each run identical paddle apertures1639\n72\nwere used in both decks, at 75 mm and at 45 mm. The low-gravity fraction yield was 31.9%1640\nw\/w. and 36.4% w\/w respectively, comparing favourably to the 28.3% w\/w reached by the drum1641\nscreen. The overall energy-based recovery was also higher for the ballistic separator runs,1642\ndue to the higher mass yield and only slightly lower LHV (11.9 MJ kg-1 ar for the drum1643\nscreen and at 11.0 MJ kg-1 ar for both the ballistic separator tests). Rough optical inspection1644\nindicated that the mineral content of the ballistic separator low-gravity product was composed1645\nof smaller particles with planer shape in comparison to the drum screen overflow. The1646\nauthors speculated that this could cause fewer problems during a final size reduction step for1647\ncontrol of the RDF PSD than the larger mineral particles apparent in the drum screen output.1648\nHowever, experience from the use of ballistic separators for plastics sorting has indicated that1649\neffectiveness as a \u201cprimary\u201d separator of plastics can be low, especially if the input has been1650\ncompacted in refuse collection vehicles, as plastic bottles that would normally report to the1651\nhigh-gravity product become flattened after compaction and report to the low-gravity1652\noutput163. On the other hand, for RDF\/SRF production purposes this may be desirable,1653\ndepending on the chemical pollution load of the misplaced components.1654\nOther large-scale MFA tests conducted by Rotter et al.49, with similar objectives but with1655\nuncomminited waste, provided evidence for the generally superior performance of ballistic1656\nseparators as the first sorting unit operation. However, performance on lowering the chemical1657\ncontamination load for the RDF\/SRF intended product was better than on mass yield grounds.1658\nComparative tests included screening at 30 mm, three stage air knife classification, two-stage1659\ncrosswise air classification, foil suction combined with infrared (IR) plastic detection, and1660\nballistic separator units with paddle openings at 40 mm, with or without upstream screening.1661\nIn all cases, bulky item removal and magnetic separation took place. Yield on an as received1662\n73\nmass basis ranged from 5% w\/w ar for foils-suction with IR plastic detection to 60% w\/w ar for1663\nscreening at 30 mm. TC values were in accordance with the identified yields. In most cases,1664\nCl enrichment took place in the final product, up to 70%. Energy-based MECs resulted in1665\nlower pollutant elemental enrichment, in comparison to the mass-based.1666\nApparently contradictory results initially warned against the danger of generalisation1667\nwhen dealing with the material flow management performance of separation and1668\nclassification unit operations. The fact that the yield to the low-gravity output of the ballistic1669\nseparator (ca. 45% w\/w ar; of after 11% w\/w ar of the test input removal of bulky and ferrous1670\nitems) was lower than to the 40 mm overscreens of the size classifier (ca. 62% w\/w ar; after1671\n8% w\/w ar of the test input removal of bulky and ferrous items)49 seemingly contradicts with1672\nthe previous results152. However, the two cases treat waste inputs significantly differently1673\n(uncomminuted versus comminuted), the screening is operated at different openings (40 mm1674\nversus 100 mm) and different designs of ballistic separators were used. This apparent1675\ncontradiction could be explained by the much higher yield anticipated for the overscreen of1676\n40 mm for an uncomminuted waste input, compared with the yield anticipated for the 1001677\nmm overscreen treating a comminuted input.1678\nTests with ballistic separators were the only way to achieve significant dilution of1679\npolluting substances (negative MEC) in the final SRF product, with the best results reported1680\nfor direct application of ballistic separation, without previous screening49. This can be1681\nattributed to the greater ability of ballistic separators to incorporate wet high CV items1682\n(paper, cardboard and textile) into the low-gravity stream. For example, paper has a Cl1683\ncontent lower than 0.5% w\/w d, which is below the average in residual waste. Additionally,1684\nhigh recovery of the highly chemically polluted components in streams other than the low-1685\n74\ngravity products enables the concentration of a low-polluted SRF stream. This is in1686\nagreement with evidence from Herhof MBT plants that reduced specific load for some trace1687\nelements of concern was reached in the low-gravity product of the ballistic separator164.1688\n4.4.8. Sensor detection and sorting1689\nVarious sensor detection and separation technologies are available including optical sensors,1690\nimage recognition, X-ray fluorescent, X-ray transmission, and IR and near-infrared (NIR),1691\neach with different strengths and weaknesses94. This technological field is currently1692\nsignicifantly developing. Harbeck and Kroog comprehensively reviewd emerging1693\ntechnologies applied in the mining industry, a constant source of technology transfer to the1694\nwaste processing165. They considered as most promising detaction methods the X-ray1695\ntransmission, evaluation of thermographic images and electromagnetic measurements,1696\nbecause they are independent of the item surface, dirt or moisture, qualities similarly1697\ndesirable in waste sorting. Colour-based sorting devices (optical sensors) have been used for1698\nover 20 years. Relatively new developments are X-ray systems166, image detection and NIR1699\ndetection coupled with pneumatic discharge48. These technologies offer novel capabilities for1700\nchemically-based waste sorting waste, in line with the emerging higher requirements for1701\neffective material flow management. If their effectiveness can be demonstrated, this could1702\nconstitute a major breakthrough in waste handling. Promising combinations of NIR with1703\nimage analysis, using sophisticated cameras, enable separation of materials based on1704\nspecialised optical characteristics, such as the surface design.1705\nIn NIR, a fast scanning spectrometer analyses the molecular structure of moving objects1706\nby NIR light. Spectrums of the most commonly used materials have been developed,1707\nenabling selective recovery of materials. Air nozzles, activated for a fraction of a second,1708\n75\nblast the identified waste particle, blowing it out of its trajectory to an appropriate discharge1709\ngate. Throughputs of 7-9 Mg h-1 are achievable with a machine width of 2000 mm48.1710\nRecovery percentages as high as 90% for high CV components (e.g. plastics, wood, paper,1711\ncardboard, diapers) are thought to be feasible. Nevertheless, cellulose-based items can only1712\nbe detected at lower percentages of 50-60%.1713\nUse of NIR in MBT plants could theoretically be used for removal of plastics with1714\nchlorinated compounds like polyvinylchloride (PVC). However, this technology is not able1715\nto detect chloride salts present in kitchen\/yard waste or in other kitchen waste contaminated1716\ncomponents167. However, the organic-bound chlorine fraction present in plastics (ca. 85%1717\nw\/w. of overall Cl) is the most detrimental part. The potential to use NIR to separate out the1718\nplastic fraction from RDF\/SRF produced via biodrying MBT, so as to increase its biogenic1719\ncontent, has been investigated in Germany168, with promising results.1720\nHowever, these technologies still need to overcome some challenges. In a large-scale test1721\nof a foil suction apparatus combined with IR plastic detection for SRF production from1722\nuncominnuted urban residual waste, mixed results were reported. Despite the high separation1723\nof the components with high chemically polluted content, the yield to the SRF product was1724\njust 5% (after bulky items and metal recovery)49. Zeiger166 reported some of the potential1725\nlimitations of the NIR applications, when used as an alternative or supplement to air1726\nclassification for RDF\/SRF production. The detected and removed output intended for1727\nRDF\/SRF production contained mainly light-coloured plastics, untreated wood and various1728\ntextiles ca. >50 mm. Many dark plastic components, coated and treated woods, and mixed1729\nmaterials that are difficult to treat cost-efficiently with NIR remained in the residual fraction1730\n(0-50 mm and high-gravity items).1731\n76\nDue to these difficulties, Zeiger166 proposed the use of X-ray sorting. Typical applications1732\nin a RDF\/SRF producing MBT could be removal of SRF impurities (inorganic matter and1733\nhighly chemically polluted matter), and separation of the high-gravity fraction from domestic1734\nand commercial waste input, for the effective concentration of the OFMSW.1735\n4.4.9. Separation of metals and batteries1736\nEffective processes to separate Fe and non-Fe waste particles are generally available and1737\nhave been summarised elsewhere94. Typical equipment for Fe metals are overhead belts and1738\ndrum magnets, with magnetic separators with alternating pole systems being particularly1739\neffective; and eddy-current separators for non-Fe48, using either centric or eccentric polar1740\nsystems. Downstream of these two basic unit operations, sensor sorting systems (inductive,1741\nNIR, and X-ray) can also be used for more sophisticated separation112. The role and1742\nobjectives of magnetic separation equipment in MBT plants vary68, but include protection of1743\ndownstream equipment from wear and tear, extraction of secondary raw material according to1744\nend-user specifications (e.g. detinning industry, and iron and steel industry), and removal of1745\ncontamination from RDF\/SRF or the OFMSW stream to be treated in AD.1746\nRecovery of Fe-metals can be up to 95%48. Eddy-current separators effectively separate1747\nnon-Fe metals, particularly for flat and isolated items, which makes screen sizing upstream1748\nand feeding with a vibration conveyor beneficial. From the non-Fe metals, aluminium (Al) is1749\nthe most important, both commercially and as a contaminant for SRF, with achieved yields1750\nup to 90%, and purities ca. 60-70%, as Al often comes combined with other materials.1751\nBatteries constitute a main source of chemical pollution. Until effective systems of1752\ncollection at source are implemented, they will continue to constitute a major challenge for1753\nmaterial management in MBT plants. Possible contamination of SRF, OFMSW or secondary1754\n77\nraw metals is evident. Avoiding breakage and effective separation are imperatives for1755\nsustainable resource management. Around 90% of batteries are magnetic or slightly1756\nmagnetic164 and can report to the fine-particle Fe fraction. For example, in the Herhof-Asslar1757\nplant, they are manually picked from the ferrous material conveyor and returned to the1758\nmanufacturers for appropriate recycling. For best results, permanent magnetic neodymium1759\ndrum separators can be used48. However, they do attract weak magnetic items contaminated1760\nwith organic adhesives.1761\nThere is evidence that for certain process configurations, waste particles with high1762\nspecific loads in trace elements of concern report to the metal product. In experiments with1763\ndifferent process configurations for SRF production, Rotter et al.49 reported that batteries,1764\nelectronic waste and other composite materials partially concentrate in the metal stream1765\nproduct, resulting in mainly Cd, and to a lesser extent lead (Pb), enrichment in the metal1766\noutput. Further evidence from Herhof MBT plants showed enrichment of the non-Fe metals1767\noutput with trace elements of concern, possibly because of electronic scrap particles164. The1768\ncontamination of the Fe and\/or non-Fe secondary raw products with trace elements of1769\nconcern creates problems with their quality and marketability. In addition, the problem of the1770\nsame high-pollution components contaminating the SRF product is not fully avoided by1771\nmagnetic separation, as some of these items still report to the fuel stream output49.1772\n4.4.10. Position and performance of unit operations in MBT plant flow-charts1773\nA challenge observed in RDF production plants during the 1980s using hammermills was to1774\nliberate and selectively reduce the size of coarse items, whilst avoiding over-pulverisation1775\nthat leads to cross-contamination62. Recently, rotary shears have been used in preference to1776\nhammermills. Another possible partial improvement could include use of screening1777\n78\nequipment ahead of the hammermill. Retrofitting the RDF Byker plant, UK, by including a1778\nbag splitter followed by a trommel before the primary shredder achieved positive results in1779\nthe final RDF quality: extensive test results, including impact on downstream operations are1780\navailable169.1781\nScreening is often used upstream of other separation processes as a pre-treatment.1782\nExperience indicates that a coarse pre-screening of 100-300 mm can be beneficial. If this1783\ncoarse pre-screening is omitted, screening of mixed MSW input at <100 mm can lead to1784\nsubstantial agglomeration, resulting in contamination of the overflow with material intended1785\nfor the underflow48.1786\nOperating experience from RDF production plants in the 1980s has shown that1787\nappropriate feedstock preparation is important for the effective operation of separation1788\nunits62. Whilst comminution is not mandatory, ACs should be at least preceded by a size1789\nclassification unit operation, such as a trommel, to optimize the sorting effect49, 65. With air-1790\nknife and crosswise air classification, the maximum allowable particle size in the AC in-feed1791\nis in the range of 250-350 mm49. However, the use of trommels ahead of ACs can affect their1792\nperformance65. Unwanted secondary composites, such as large textile agglomerations, may1793\nbe formed and lead to AC operational faults. Bar-shaped particles can report to the trommel1794\nunderflow, even if one of the other dimensions of the particle is larger than the aperture size1795\nof the trommel, resulting in items exceeding the maximum desirable size.1796\nOn the other hand, ballistic separators are non-sensitive to a dispersed PSD of the input1797\nstream. When treating residual waste previously screened at 0-150 mm, the performance was1798\nslightly worse than treating the unscreened stream49. This indicated that screening ahead of1799\nballistic separators may not render the desired result.1800\n79\nIt is evident that drying of waste facilitates can facilitate the flow of waste matrices621801\nand subsequent mechanical processing. Moisture content of the as delivered residual waste1802\n(ca. 15-40% w\/w 164; ca. 35-55% w\/w 133) is unfavourable for efficient screening. Typically,1803\nbiodried output has moisture content lower than 15% w\/w, but fluctuations are common.1804\nReduction of moisture content by biodrying reduces the formation of lumpy material that1805\nsticks together and creates problems for efficient separation. Low-gravity yield of air1806\nclassifiers for RDF\/SRF production could benefit from a dried input. For example, eddy-1807\ncurrent separators, separating non-Fe metallic material, can particularly benefit from1808\noperating with a comminuted dried and disaggregated material48, 164. They are most1809\neffective with a mono-layer of single particles. However, ballistic separators can effectively1810\nincorporate wet input fractions into the low-gravity product49. This indicates that if such a1811\nunit is used before composting\/AD for RDF\/SRF production, the output would have1812\nincreased drying needs. Alternatively, after biodrying, this problem could be avoided. If1813\nprocessing SRF into hard pellets is necessary, e.g. for subsequent shaft reactor gasification, a1814\nmoisture content not exceeding 10% should be achieved133.1815\n4.5. Mechanical processing conclusions1816\nEvolving objectives of material flow management and higher standards determine the needs1817\nfor mechanical processing in MBT plants that produce RDF\/SRF. Segregating out waste1818\nfractions with the desired chemical composition progressively becomes more important in the1819\ndesign of these systems. For example, with the objective of high-grade SRF production, it is1820\nnot sufficient to separate a comminuted coarse fraction just on a PSD basis. The need to1821\nobtain the maximum achievable yield in high CV, low in pollutant load and possibly high in1822\n80\nbiogenic content SRF demands definition and selective separation of waste fractions on the1823\nbasis of their biochemical properties49, 170.1824\nSpecific material flow performance descriptors and overall analytical tools can1825\nsignificantly facilitate the achievement of plant objectives. For example, PSDs can be a1826\nuseful tool to inform the quality of waste fractions to be processed, if used properly. MFA1827\nhas recently been employed to accurately map and predict behaviour of MBT systems, along1828\nwith the conventional performance descriptors of mass-based yield, recovery and purity.1829\nMFA can depict the partitioning of preserved properties of waste, such as content in trace1830\nelements of concern, into the output fractions. Despite some very promising experimental1831\nresults reported in recent studies, most of the data comes from theoretical investigations.1832\nThere is a need for additional experimental MFA research on a test and commercial reference1833\nplant scale.1834\nResults on mechanical processing of residual waste in MBT plants are limited, often come1835\nfrom non-peer-reviewed sources, and some lack application of standardised methods and\/or1836\nstatistical analysis. Data from MBT plants comes from a variety of plant configurations,1837\noperated towards different objectives and with specific feedstock. This restricts their1838\ncomparability and possible wider applicability of results.1839\nBiodrying appears to provide the advantage of optimally preparing the waste for1840\nmechanical treatment. Promising results in terms of selective comminution and fast1841\nbiodegradation were achieved by ball-mill pre-treatment. Overall MFA data verified the1842\ndifficulty of effective chemical separation solely by mechanical means. Zinc (Zn) and Cl are1843\ndifficult to dilute in SRF produced from residual MSW, because of the highly diffused1844\n81\ndistribution within various waste components49. Advances in processing equipment, such as1845\nballistic separators or NIR and X-ray sorting, may provide better solutions for specific uses.1846\n1847\n5. RDF\/SRF QUALITY MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES1848\n1849\n5.1. Importance of quality management for RDF\/SRF marketability1850\nQuality management for RDF\/SRF plays a key role in efforts to establish viable market1851\noutlets, not least by creating confidence in suppliers, end-users,46 and regulators75. Quality1852\nmanagement is concerned with activities that direct an organisation to fulfil the requirements1853\nof involved parties171. Quality management systems (QMS), consist of: quality planning,1854\nquality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) schemes, and a general framework for a1855\nQMS for SRF has been provided by CEN75. At the current stage of the development for1856\nRDF\/SRF this has been largely limited to QA\/QC. Quality assurance (QA) addresses the1857\nwhole range of customer requirements, including the quality of organisation performance1858\n(documentation, timing, logistics, and proper use of equipment), and product quality, in terms1859\nof reproducable levels of key properties172. Product requirements can be specified by: the1860\nregulator, related institutions, associations, or pressure groups, specific customers; or the1861\nproducer in anticipation of customer requirements. These may take the form of product1862\nand\/or process standards (e.g. product certificates provided on the basis of an assessment1863\nguideline), technical specifications, contractual agreements between producers and1864\nretailers\/end-users, trade and\/or involved parties provisional agreements (e.g. quality marks),1865\nor regulatory requirements (e.g. regulations in permits)171, 173.1866\n82\nStandardisation, namely the development of classes and specifications for key product1867\nfeatures against which fuels can be controlled, is an important part of QA. Market1868\nconfidence in waste-derived products can be built, when standards are in place and adequate1869\nquality control is implemented. Encouraging examples in the UK context are the \u201cCompost1870\nQuality Protocol\u201d174, a quality protocol for the production and use of compost, (a recent1871\nupdate from the previous BSI PAS 100:200, a publicly available standard for composted1872\nmaterials175); and the code of good practice for landspreading of biosolids, commonly known1873\nas the \u201csafe sludge matrix\u201d176. Lasaridi et al.177 have argued for EU compost quality1874\nstandards, which would harmonise the wide range of limit values currently in place within the1875\nvarious member states. According to CEN30, 58, European Standards (ENs) for SRF could1876\npotentially guarantee the quality of fuel for energy producers, enabling the efficient trading of1877\nSRFs and increasing public trust. Standards could provide access to permits for SRF use;1878\nenable the rationalisation of design criteria for thermal recovery units; result in cost savings1879\nfor co-incineration plants, reducing the need for compliance monitoring; facilitate trans-1880\nborder movements; aid communication with equipment manufacturers; and ease reporting on1881\nthe use of fuels from renewable energy sources. However, standardisation in isolation cannot1882\nguarantee increased market share 172. The European market for SRF\/RDF is still developing1883\nand remains unpredictable. For example, in Germany, the ban on landfilling of thermally1884\nrecoverable and untreated biodegradable fractions of MSW has resulted in an increase in1885\nMBT-derived RDF\/SRF production, far exceeding the available utilisation capacity45. This1886\nshortfall in the capacity for MBT-derived RDF\/SRF has led to some material being treated in1887\nconventional waste incineration plants (WIP), whilst the surplus RDF is temporarily baled1888\nand stored in \u201cdepositories\u201d in landfill sites178. From 2008, the RDF\/SRF utilisation capacity1889\n83\nis anticipated to rise, mainly through the construction of new mono-combustion plants45.1890\nRecent scenarios predicting an overall surplus of RDF availability to at least 2013178 have1891\nbeen superseded by a predicted shortfall for RDF\/SRF during 2011-201237, 42.1892\nThe marketability of MBT-produced RDF\/SRF depends largely on successful1893\nimplementation of QA\/QC schemes, especially, in the light of the wider technical, financial,1894\npolicy and legislative challenges23, 37, 42, 45, 179, Juniper, 2005 #713, 180-182. RDF\/SRF is anticipated to1895\nface high competition from standard fossil fuels and proven substitute fuels, such as biosolids1896\n(sewage sludge), used tyres and rubber, used oils and solvents, ground offal, biomass, scrap1897\ntimber, carpet scraps and bleaching soils5, 45. An analysis of current and future quantities and1898\nprospects for these secondary fuels has been compiled by Thom\u00e9-Kozmiensky133.1899\nStandardisation and development of guidance on quality assurance plans for the European1900\nmarket of solid biofuels has also advanced recently172, 183, 184.1901\nMBT-derived RDF\/SRF product quality encompasses three critical aspects; the degree of1902\nvariability, level of desirable properties and level of contaminants. It is critical for MBT1903\nplants to attain and ensure WDFs of acceptable variability. Competitive secondary fuels1904\nproduced from less variable commercial\/industrial waste streams or mono-batches may have1905\nan inherently more acceptable profile185. A quality-certified SRF does not necessarily imply1906\na high fuel quality. Instead, it relates to a more consistent, continuously produced fuel that1907\nmeets the quality demanded by end-users and their regulators. Producing SRF of known and1908\nconsistent quality out of the mixed\/residual MSW input to MBT processes, characterised by1909\nhigh temporal variability and heterogeneity, is a major technical challenge5, 49. However, in1910\naddition to MBT-derived SRF of invariable quality, the development of specialised SRF1911\nproducts, adapted to specific thermal recovery end-uses, produced by suitably designed MBT1912\n84\nplants, could prove similarly critical for its future competitiveness36, 181. The recent1913\nretrofitting of the Nehlsen biodrying plant in Stralsund to provide three different qualities of1914\nSRF vividly illustrates this need89.1915\nThe RDF\/SRF contaminant properties and combustion behaviour critically affects its1916\npotential applications. Problems with low quality RDF characteristics, particularly high1917\nchlorine and trace metals content, have led to a decline in co-combustion applications in1918\nGermany49, 52. The ability of mechanical flow-stream separation in MBT plants to fully1919\nachieve the desired low levels of chemical contamination has been questioned5, 49, 52. RDF1920\nacceptability problems have been attributed to both unfavourable properties and variability in1921\nRDF input5. The existing surplus in RDF\/SRF production in countries such as Germany is1922\nlikely to force MBT operators to produce SRF of higher and\/or more application-specific1923\nquality, leading to lower SRF yield and a higher volume of residual fraction that needs1924\nadequate disposal (incineration or landfill). This would imply higher technical difficulties1925\nand may demand retrofitting of existing SRF production lines, with more acute dilemmas for1926\nmaterial flow management; and increased operational costs for MBT plants45. One1927\nimplication of moving towards more technically complex unit processes in order to produce1928\nSRF of more consistent and required quality is the additional energy consumption associated1929\nwith a lower yield of SRF and more reject materials. An optimal balance among the1930\nobjectives of SRF product quality, cost and overall health and environmental protection,1931\nshould be sought.1932\nQuality management can build consensus upon perceived RDF\/SRF quality.1933\nMeasurements pertaining to the same RDF batch conducted with different sampling plans and1934\nanalytical determination, performed at varying points of product life (e.g. within the1935\n85\nproduction plant or just before end-use), by different laboratories, and for stakeholders with1936\npartly conflicting interests, may result in surprisingly diverging results, as has been reported1937\nfor Germany186. Hence, implementation of appropriate QA\/QC for MBT production lines of1938\nRDF\/SRF based on a sound scientific basis is imperative. In this manner, actual and1939\nperceived issues stemming from unfavourable constituents and variability in residual waste1940\ninput composition can be addressed185. In addition, the production of a consistent, fit-for-1941\npurpose product, that is acceptable to regulatory authorities can be verified, possibly at a1942\nreduced cost through avoidance of duplicate or unnecessarily frequent QC183.1943\n5.2. Standards and quality assurance\/control for RDF\/SRF1944\nQuality assurance and control systems for WDF already exist and new ones are under1945\ndevelopment. In the 1980s in the US, the American Society for Testing and Materials1946\n(ASTM) defined classes of RDF based on the form of final product and type of production1947\nprocesses57, 187. In Europe, QA\/QC schemes have been applied internally by producers and\/or1948\nend-users, for example, RWE Umwelt AG185. Many national initiatives were launched1949\naround 2000, achieving different degrees of implementation. Quality control procedures and1950\nstandards for RDF\/SRF have been described and discussed elsewhere5, 30, 32-34, 46, 49, 75, 185, 186,1951\n188-190. TABLE 11 summarises the current QA\/QC initiatives for WDFs in Europe.1952\n1953\n<<Table 11>>1954\n1955\nThese attempts at WDF quality management differ substantially. They may apply1956\nnationally or regionally; be legally binding or constitute trade provisional agreements; rely1957\nupon waste input origin or final product quality; or refer to all or specific end-users. Schulz-1958\n86\nEllermann33 provides an overview of the current status of European standards and QA\/QC1959\nschemes for SRF. TABLE 12 lists the limits for key properties from existing European SRF1960\nquality standards.1961\n1962\n<<Table 12>>1963\n1964\nIn the following section the CEN European standard for SRF is briefly presented. This is1965\nfollowed by a discussion of the key properties of SRF that should be taken into account1966\nduring the design and operation of the MBT processes, from the perspective of specific end-1967\nusers.1968\n5.3. SRF classification and specification by CEN1969\nThe CEN technical standard for SRF specification and classes constitutes part of the wider1970\nextensive ongoing research and development effort for a European SRF QA\/QC system58.1971\nMajor findings of the pre-normative research were published as a technical report1972\ndocument196, where the relative scientific evidence and rationale for final choices is detailed..1973\nDevelopment of this standard has been adapted to customer-specific requirements, both1974\ntechnical and legislative, such as meeting the Waste Incineration Directive (WID) emission1975\nlimits. Achievable quality of WDFs has also been considered. It applies at the interface1976\nbetween SRF producer and intended end-user, rather than being input oriented58.1977\nClass codes (1-5), defined by boundary values without overlapping (i.e., closed intervals),1978\nhave been finally adopted for each of three key fuel properties196. They serve as indicators of1979\nSRF performance with respect to economics (mean NVC), measured as received); technology1980\n(mean chlorine content, measured dry); and environment (median and 80th percentile values1981\n87\nfor Hg content, measured dry - specific statistics apply depending on the available number of1982\nmeasurements)58, 190. Each property should be determined according to specified sampling1983\nplans, including sample preparation and analytical techniques. The degree of chemical1984\ncontamination can be expressed either on per mass (mg kg-1) or per energy output (mg MJ-1)1985\nbasis190, 196. The most appropriate method depends on the intended information required.1986\nEach property value can fall within five classes. The SRF is assigned a class number for1987\neach property and the combination of the three class numbers defines its class code. TABLE1988\n13 summarises the recommended classes, descriptors and values.1989\n1990\n<<Table 13>>1991\n1992\nFour other key SRF descriptors have been proposed, but not included in the final1993\nclassification scheme for simplicity and practicality reasons. They are ash content (% d),1994\nmoisture content (% ar), and sum of heavy metals (mg kg-1 d)190, 196. The sum value of Cd1995\nplus thallium (Tl) (Cd+Tl) has also been proposed as an important environmental descriptor.1996\nIn the final CEN draft, Cd+Tl was rejected on the basis that Hg alone mostly results in a1997\nhigher or equal classification than the Cd+Tl value of the same SRF, resulting in a more1998\nconservative and hence sufficiently environmentally safe coding, and Tl has no influence on1999\nthe classification of Cd+Tl, because of the relatively low value of Tl compared to Cd.2000\n5.4. SRF product quality standards for specific end-uses2001\n5.4.1. Specifications for end uses vs. classification2002\nClass codes are a tool for identifying and pre-selecting SRF by giving an immediate, but2003\ninevitably simplifying, image of the SRF quality. However, class codes cannot predict the2004\n88\nactual performance of SRF when used (see TABLE 2) for a list of possible RDF\/SRF uses).2005\nDefinition of specific SRF properties and value ranges, thresholds and limits most relevant to2006\neach SRF utilisation plant in accordance with the particular technical characteristics, and2007\nlegal demands of each thermal recovery process, is imperative for its marketability36.2008\nIn order to appropriately characterise SRF, physical-mechanical, chemical and biological2009\ndescriptors should be identified. Ultimate and proximate analyses are the minimum2010\nprerequisite to assess the thermal recovery behaviour and performance of a fuel197.2011\nSpecifying SRF according to the CEN guidance demands a general list of obligatory and2012\nvoluntary descriptors to be quantified. Properties should be measured according to2013\nappropriate, existing, or under development, CEN standard methods190. However, Thom\u00e9-2014\nKozmiensky133 and Beckmann et al.36 stressed that effective use in varying applications2015\ndemands the determination of a more complete list of properties (TABLE 14).2016\n2017\n<<Table 14>>2018\n2019\nFor example, characterisation of the reaction-related properties is critical, especially for2020\nco-combustion applications. For instance, Hilber et al.198 have recently developed a method2021\nfor assessing the process-specific combustion behaviour of low in char-formation RDF\/SRF:2022\nthe de-volatilisation of SRF at specific temperatures is measured by multi-sample thermo-2023\ngravimetric analysis (TGA). In the case of biofuel QA\/QC, which has similarities with2024\nWDFs, the significance and interrelationships of important physical-mechanical fuel2025\nproperties have been investigated by Hartmann199; and the chemical properties reviewed by2026\nObernberger et al.200. Eckardt and Albers46 investigated the current use of specification2027\n89\nproperties and limits proposed by plant operators in various thermal recovery applications of2028\nSRF.2029\nHowever, even within each specific category of RDF\/SRF end-uses, it can be2030\nchallenging to agree upon defensible specifications that are applicable to every end-use. A2031\nwealth of available expertise has been incorporated in the relevant CEN report196. Despite2032\nthat it might still be evident that there is limited understanding of RDF\/SRF behaviour within2033\nthe various possible thermal recovery systems, resulting in the absence of robust technical2034\nand environmental criteria for their use as substitute fuel46. Furthermore, generalisation on2035\nfuel combustion behaviour is not advisable, and plant-specific investigations are preferable,2036\nbecause, for instance, transfer factors for elements of concern are highly process and2037\noperation mode-specific36, 196, 198. In addition, it is usual practice for each plant to prepare its2038\nown unique blend of substitute and raw fuels, leading to varying, case-specific contract2039\nspecifications5, 46.2040\nIn co-combustion of RDF\/SRF with fossil fuels (and other WDFs), the actual degree2041\nof substitution varies, depending on the comparable quality of the RDF\/SRF with the rest of2042\nthe fuels, along with any related legal stipulations. Substitution of the original fuels by2043\nRDF\/SRF depends on compatibility of the RDF\/SRF properties with the thermal recovery2044\nprocess, typically designed for fossil fuels. For example, pulverised hard coal-fired plants2045\nwith wet bottom boiler types (i.e., with molten slag with cyclones) (WBB) are more tolerant2046\nto the shape and dimensions of SRF, in comparison to plants with dry bottom boilers2047\n(DBB)196. It has been estimated that coal-fired plants may reach up to 20% w\/w. substitution2048\nin the long run190; for cement kilns the percentage may vary between 50-100% w\/w.2049\nDedicated fluidised bed combustion (FBC) and gasification\/pyrolysis plants are not2050\n90\nconstrained by such limitations. However, Beckmann and Thom\u00e9-Kozmiensky45 stressed2051\nthat substitution rates as low as 1% w\/w. have been established for various thermal SRF2052\nrecovery applications in the German state of North Rhine Westphalia. Even these low2053\nsubstitution rates have to be proven in future practice and for higher rates process-specific2054\nlimit values should be convincingly defined for reaction kinetic properties. For2055\nconfidentiality reasons, contract-based specifications do not often fully reach the public2056\ndomain. This constrains the development of a wider consensus on what constitutes accepted,2057\nfit-for-purpose RDF\/SRF quality.2058\nNevertheless, it has been argued that maximum acceptable concentrations of trace2059\nelements of concern in SRF may be used to indicate its environmental suitability for a certain2060\nend-user190. Maximum values exist in national legislation regarding blending of wastes with2061\nfossil fuels. They usually apply to the most volatile elements, namely Hg and Cd or Cd+Tl.2062\nStandards also apply to the \u201csum of other heavy metals.\u201d33. An indicative list of SRF2063\nenvironmental classes that could be accepted for certain technologies, based on conservative2064\nassumptions for trace elements is presented in TABLE 15.2065\n2066\n<<Table 15>>2067\n2068\nvan Tubergen et al.190 calculated estimations for the value ranges of SRF class-coding2069\nproperties that could be accepted for different end-uses. For comparison, Eckardt and2070\nAlbers46 provided data on Cd, Hg and Tl limits specified for SRF by certain thermal recovery2071\ncommercial references in Germany.2072\nThe most important descriptors and acceptance values\/classes for the main SRF end-2073\n91\nusers, focusing on potential properties of concern, are discussed below. Beckmann and2074\nThom\u00e9-Kozmiensky36 have detailed the experience in Germany. SRF particle form, size and2075\nshape exemplify the differences in the end-user specifications and NVC are discussed2076\nseparately.2077\n5.4.2. Cement industry2078\nThe cement industry has a long-established experience with use of WDFs189, especially for2079\nwet processes, but increasingly for modern dry ones190. Use of substitute fuels up to 50%2080\nw\/w. has led to changes in the operating features of the cement industry, such as flame2081\ncharacteristics, shape and stability, and ignition properties36. The wide range of values for2082\nproperties of RDF\/SRF required by cement kiln operators indicates the resilience of this end-2083\nuse196; but also reflects the variety of cement kiln configurations. NCV is the most important2084\nsingle parameter for substitute fuel selection in the cement industry181, 190. The German2085\ncement industry has the highest median NCV of RDF used (not exclusively MBT-derived),2086\ncompared with other end-uses, being ca. 21 MJ Kg-1. TABLE 16 provides an overview of2087\nexisting standards applicable to RDF\/SRF used in the European cement industry.2088\n2089\n<<Table 16>>2090\n2091\nConcerns have arisen about the possible major technical and environmental problems that2092\nrelate to fuel properties. These are outlined below and were reviewed in detail by van2093\nTubergen et al.190, the subsequent CEN technical report196, and Beckmann and Thom\u00e9-2094\nKozmiensky36.2095\n92\n(a) Kiln system operation: various possibilities exist for firing SRF in different types of2096\ncement production plants, leading to different SRF specifications201, 202. For example, SRF2097\nclinker firing in a dry method is possible in36 kiln exit (primary firing), where only high CV2098\n(LHV ca. 20 MJ Kg-1), dispersible SRF is suitable to achieve gas temperatures ca. 1600 \u00b0C2099\nand avoid reducing conditions. This is also possible in kiln entrance (secondary firing),2100\nwhich is less demanding in LHV terms. Use in the calcinatory is even less demanding 36, 181:2101\nlarger SRF material, of lower LHV and higher ash content can be accepted. Cl, sulphur (S)2102\nand alkali content (Na, K) can form compounds that build up in the kiln system, causing2103\naccumulation, clogging and unstable operation189. Excessive Cl content in dry processes may2104\nblock the pre-heater with condensed volatile chlorides, according to end-users\u2019 experience,2105\nand as acknowledged by specifications from Belgium, Germany and France190. Acceptable2106\nCl content depends on the degree of substitution, K and Na content, and existence of salt2107\nbypass. Wet processes are more tolerant, accepting up to 6% w\/w ar input Cl content.2108\nRecently developed chlorine bypass equipment has been reported to be able to achieve2109\nthermal substitution rates of fossil energy above 30%, reducing chlorine content in the hot2110\nmeal by approximately 50%203. Nevertheless, in general salt bypass systems result in loss of2111\nmass and energy, incurring additional operational costs46. High moisture content can reduce2112\nthe kiln productivity and efficiency. Ash content affects the chemical composition of the2113\ncement, and may necessitate adjustment of the raw materials mix189.2114\n(b) Air emissions: most of the trace elements are absorbed in the clinker product with the2115\nexception of the volatile elements Hg and thallium (Tl) that transfer to the raw flue gas, but to2116\na lesser degree compared with other thermal recovery technologies. In the case where2117\nRDF\/SRF with high ash content is used, the subsequent low NCV (e.g. 3.2-10 MJ kg-1 ar),2118\n93\nresults in ca. ten times higher values of Hg concentrations, expressed on an energy2119\nsubstitution basis (mg MJ-1 ar), compared with low-ash RDF\/SRF (NCV ca. 11.7-25.5 MJ kg-2120\n1 ar)196. However, there is evidence that Hg can be virtually removed from off-gasses by2121\nelectrostatic precipitators in the kiln system. Juniper5 reviewed literature on dioxins and2122\nfurans emissions from cement kilns that substitute fossil fuels with a percentage of WDFs,2123\nand found no significant increase in the measured concentrations in the stack gasses due to2124\nthe use of WDFs. A recent report concluded that co-processing of alternative fuels fed to the2125\nmain burner, kiln inlet or the preheater\/precalciner does not appear to influence or change the2126\nemissions of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including pesticides, hexachlorobenzene2127\n(HCB), industrial chemical polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PCDD\/Fs202.2128\n(c) Clinker and cement product quality: the concerns of the cement industry focus2129\naround Cl, S and alkali content (affecting overall product quality); phosphate content, which2130\ninfluences setting time; and chromium, which can cause an allergic reaction to sensitive2131\nusers189. An investigation of the potential effects of co-combustion of various WDF (other2132\nthan RDF\/SRF) in the cement production industry showed only a slight increase in trace2133\nelement concentrations (Antimony (Sb), Cd, Zn) in the final product201. Cd, Copper (Cu) and2134\nSb from municipal waste fuel constituted a relatively more significant input to the clinker2135\ncomposition compared with other fuel sources. Despite the significant differences among2136\nindividual leaching characteristics of trace elements, it has been established that the release of2137\ntrace elements from concrete is negligibly small during its operational life-span; and that2138\nthere is no systematic correlation between the total content of trace elements in cement2139\nmortar and the leaching from mortar, even under the worst-case scenario.2140\n94\nWith respect to the use of substitute fuels containing elevated concentrations of trace2141\nelements in clinker production, Opoczky and Gavel measured a positive effect on its2142\ngrindability204. Chromium (Cr), Zn, barium (Ba), nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), and phosphorus2143\n(P) generally improve grindability of clinkers by facilitating the clinker formation process2144\nduring the molten phase and by forming solid solutions with silicate minerals (alite, belite)2145\nduring clinker burning.2146\n5.4.3. Direct co-combustion in coal-fired power plants2147\nIn Europe there is limited recent experience of SRF use for electricity generation, which is2148\nmainly restricted to small-scale plants in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy190, and in the2149\nUK205. To illustrate this, RECOFUEL has been a considerable EU research programme that2150\nbegun in 2004 to investigate the potential use of WDF in large-scale coal-fired power2151\nplants190, 206. Deposits of metallic aluminium and aluminium oxides were evident at the2152\nbeater mill surfaces, which could have resulted from the relatively high Al2O3 content of the2153\nspecific SRF used at the trial206.2154\nRequirements vary according to plant design and coal type, but are generally higher than2155\nalternative options for RDF\/SRF thermal recovery181. The J\u00e4nschwalde brown coal power2156\nplant (BCPP) in Germany uses SRF at an average calculated substitution rate of 1.8% w\/w,2157\nwithout any significant impact on operational performance and emissions36. However, for a2158\nmore conclusive evaluation, results from continuous long-term operations are required. More2159\ndemanding specifications apply for the Werne hard coal power plant (HCPP)207, as reported2160\nby Beckmann and Thom\u00e9-Kozmiensky36. A summary of the relevant specifications can be2161\nfound in Beckmann208, cited by Beckmann and Thom\u00e9-Kozmiensky36. Specific technical and2162\n95\nenvironmental issues with SRF quality during direct co-combustion with various types of2163\ncoal, in different boiler technologies have been identified:2164\n(a) Air emissions and air pollution control: it may prove difficult to control emissions2165\nof highly volatile trace elements, such as Hg, Cd, and Tl190. These emissions largely remain2166\nin the vapour phase or become absorbed on ultra fine particulates for which air pollution2167\ncontrol removal efficiencies are low. Increased capture of volatile trace elements2168\npreferentially partitioning in the flue gas will demand use of capital-expensive equipment and2169\ncreate secondary hazardous waste in need of careful management and costly2170\ntreatment\/disposal5. In addition, control of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur dioxide (SO2)2171\nemissions to WID limits may demand the use of additional air pollution control (APC)2172\nequipment. If selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is used for NOx abatement, accelerated2173\naging and deactivation of the SCR catalyst should be anticipated in both high and low dust2174\ndesigns, because of the higher RDF\/SRF content in alkali metals5.2175\n(b) Airborne particulate matter (PM): initial results from test runs of the RECOFUEL2176\nproject at the Weisweiler RWE power plant, co-combusting Rheinish brown coal with low2177\nLHV (8.15 MJ kg-1) with RDF\/SRF of higher LHV (15.4 MJ kg-1) (REMONDIS SBS\u00ae2178\nproduced from sorting of residual MSW) at relatively high thermal substitution rate (8.5% of2179\noverall thermal input) showed no significant changes of the flue gas emissions that could be2180\nallocated to the SRF use206. Trace elements such as Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn are of concern for2181\ntheir presence in airborne PM, associated with acute respiratory symptoms in humans.2182\nEvidence by Fernandez et al.209 indicates that concentrations of these elements in ash can be2183\nhigher when MBT-derived RDF\/SRF is co-combusted than when only German bituminous2184\ncoal is combusted209. However, comparison of ash-derived PM of non-MBT RDF co-2185\n96\ncombusted at 30-34 % w\/w substitution rate, with that of German bituminous coal alone, did2186\nnot reach conclusive results on the health impacts of long-term exposure on mice. Exposure2187\nto coal\/RDF ash particles was found less desirable than exposure to coal ash particles alone.2188\nStaged operation mode of coal\/RDF co-combustion (leading to low NOx emissions)2189\nexacerbated only short-term lung injury in mice.2190\n(c) Quality of marketable by-products: concerns have been expressed regarding the2191\npotentially adverse impact on the quality of marketable by-products i.e. boiler ash, pulverised2192\nfly ash (PFA) and gypsum. Their chemical, physical and mineralogical properties may be2193\naffected5. Possible increases in trace element content and higher contents of unburned carbon2194\nand alkaline metal species could result in values that are unacceptable by secondary raw2195\nmaterial standards or customer specifications. However, combustion studies at a pulverised2196\nhard coal DBB using dried sewage sludge, which typically has a higher trace element2197\nconcentration compared with typical MBT-derived SRF, showed insignificant change in the2198\nby-product quality190. Bulky contaminants in the RDF\/SRF can become incorporated in the2199\nby-products lowering their quality. RDF\/SRF should be free from bulky undesirable2200\nconstituents that are incombustible (metal particles) or may not be completely combusted2201\nbecause of insufficient residence time in the combustion chamber (e.g. hard plastics,2202\npolystyrene, and wood chips)46. Chlorine may adversely influence the ash quality intended as2203\nfiller in cement, accordingly limiting the acceptable substitution rate.2204\n(d) Plant operation: WDFs have been reported as having lower softening point (SP) and2205\nmelting point (MP) temperatures than coal, resulting in an increased scaling or corrosion2206\npotential36. The corrosion potential is enhanced by a lower S content, higher alkali and2207\nhigher trace elements of concern, estimated as low for S\/Cl>4 and as high for S\/Cl<279, as2208\n97\ncited by Beckmann and Thom\u00e9-Kozmiensky36. Hence, the Cl concentration of the overall2209\nfuel mixture should be restricted to prevent high temperature corrosion. Design and2210\nconstruction materials of the boiler affect the maximum allowable Cl content, estimated up to2211\n0.2% w\/w in the Netherlands and 0.4% w\/w in the UK190. Alkali metals are molten at2212\ncombustion temperatures (slagging), increasing the risk of accumulation of fused deposits on2213\nthe heat transfer surfaces (fouling)5. Abrasive RDF\/SRF constituents, such as grit and glass2214\nparticulates, may erode the heat transfer tubes5. Heavy wooden and plastic compounds even2215\nat particle size of 20 mm exhibit different combustion behaviour than pulverised hard-coal2216\nand have to be separated out181. A higher moisture content of SRF (10-20 % wt.) compared2217\nwith that of coal (ca. 5% w\/w.) could result in increased gas water content and subsequently2218\nincreased gas volume in the boiler, restricting the substitution rate of SRF to 5-10% w\/w.5.2219\nAdditional operational end-user issues regarding RDF\/SRF storage, mechanical pre-2220\nprocessing, blending, conveying and feeding have been summarised elsewhere5.2221\n5.4.4. Co-combustion in industrial boilers2222\nUS Department of Environment data indicates that ca. 25% of the fuels currently used in2223\nindustrial boilers, furnaces and process heaters, to satisfy steam and heat production needs,2224\nare solid and can potentially be substituted by SRF5. In the UK, the most viable cases are the2225\npaper and pulp, and metallurgical industries. In these cases, potential corrosion of the heat2226\ntransfer surface by Cl and S can prove critical to the performance of an industrial boiler. In2227\nthe steel industry, there is limited possibility for using RDF\/SRF, mainly by injecting it2228\ndirectly into the blast furnace to provide additional heating energy. This may demand low2229\nconcentrations of Cl, S, major inorganics and trace elements of concern.2230\n98\n5.4.5. Indirect co-combustion and dedicated mono-combustion2231\nThermal pre-treatment of RDF\/SRF creates various attractive alternative scenarios for their2232\nuse5, 45, 46, 205. These include mono-combustion, for example, by fluidised bed combustion2233\n(FBC), namely thermal recovery in a dedicated plant that uses RDF\/SRF as the only fuel2234\nsource, and indirect thermal recovery of RDF\/SRF, by feeding with RDF\/SRF pyrolysis2235\nand\/or gasification systems, or FBC prior to introducing the char\/syngas to conventional2236\npower plants. The term combustion is used here within the terms co\/mono-combustion to2237\ndenote any thermal recovery process (e.g. pyrolysis), following the established terminology2238\nwhich does not restrict it to its accurate scientific definition.2239\nIn Germany such plants run in continuous operation, typically using lower quality RDF.2240\nExamples include gasification of RDF in circulating FBC with the produced gas used at the2241\ncalciner firing of a kiln at the Ruedersdorf cement works, pyrolysis of RDF in a rotary kiln2242\nand feeding of the syngas and the appropriately processed char in to the boiler of the Hamm2243\npower station, and combustion of the pyrolysis coke in an FBC45. Hamel et al.210 reviewed2244\nthe literature of gasification process configurations with the thermal recovery of SRF derived2245\nfrom biodrying MBT; they have also developed and tested a fit-for-purpose two-stage2246\ngasifier, based on a parallel arrangement of fixed bed gasifier and bubbling fluidised bed2247\ncombustor modules.2248\nRelevant SRF quality standards for such end-uses are thought to be less demanding than2249\nthose for co-combustion in power and cement plants5, 36, 46, 181. Ibbetson and Wengenroth1812250\nhave stressed that for dedicated RFD\/SRF plants that produce steam and power (FBC or grate2251\nfired systems) the important quality parameters are the ones affecting steam temperature and2252\n99\nplant availability (particle size, metallic Al, alkali metals content, glass chlorine content),2253\nrather than CV.2254\nFor circulating FBC, least variable fluidisation behaviour and narrow PSD are required,2255\nwhilst the process is more tolerant to wider ranges of elemental analysis and LHV36. In2256\ndedicated gasification for subsequent syngas use in power plant boilers, fouling and corrosion2257\nof heat transfer surfaces by compounds of released alkali metals such as Na and K salts,2258\ncould be a problem. In FBC co-combustion the most harmful elements are Cl and alkali2259\nmetals causing corrosion and fouling; and Al, which can lead to bed agglomeration and2260\nblocking of air injection ports34. Kobyashi et al.211 provided evidence that mixing of calcium2261\ncompounds into RDF\/SRF can effectively remove HCl from the flue gases, even in a high2262\ntemperature regime, for circulation FBCs; the mechanism of removal has been initially2263\ndiscussed by Liu et al.212. Volatile matter content was found to be the critical parameter to2264\nwaste biomass gasification performance for air-stream gasification213.2265\nKilgalllon et al.214 have reviewed the literature and performed thermodynamic modelling2266\non the fate of trace contaminants in various gasification systems co-gasifying coal with2267\nbiomass-rich fuels. They concluded that fuel gas compositions vary significantly between2268\ngasification systems, and the most trace and alkali metals exhibit increased volatility when2269\ncompared with their behaviour in combustion systems, with their volatility being influenced2270\nby the S and Cl concentrations. Na and K, and trace elements Pb, Zn, Cd, tin (Sn) (and2271\nvanadium (V) in certain systems) can pass to the gas turbine through the fuel gas path at2272\npotentially harmful levels; Hg, boron (B), Sb, and selenium (Se) also can pass through the gas2273\nturbine.2274\n100\nRDF\/SRF can be treated by pyrolysis to produce a homogenised, high CV char fuel215,2275\nwith Cl, S and the content of trace elements of concern the most relevant properties in2276\ntechnical and environmental terms. Enrichment of certain trace elements (Cd, Cr, cobalt2277\n(Co), Ni, Pb, Zn) has been observed in the char, demanding a more intensive removal of these2278\ncontaminants during the RDF\/SRF production. Similarly, enrichment in the Cl content in the2279\nchar (char: 1.30% w\/w. d, from Herhof dry-stabilate RDF\/SRF: 1.05% w\/w. d), because of2280\nabsorption on inorganic ash compounds after its release, could cause acceptability problems.2281\nIn another case, only the pyrolysis gas from rotary-tube pyrolysis of SRF is fed into the steam2282\ngenerator of a power plant, with the char undergoing additional separate treatment36.2283\n5.4.6. RDF\/SRF particle form, particle size limitations and homogeneity2284\nParticle form and size are obligatory descriptors in the CEN SRF specification. Kock2162285\nproposed a new modelling method for characterisation of combustion properties of2286\nheterogeneous flues as RDF\/SRF, relying on the PSD of RDF\/SRF. Conveying and dosing of2287\nRDF\/SRF into the processes, and firing technology, affect the appropriate delivery form2288\n(pellets, bales, briquettes, chips, flakes, fluff, powder, etc), size range and shape of2289\nRDF\/SRF46. TABLE 15 provides suitable preparation forms and storage for intended uses.2290\nClear differences exist in the preferred medians and tolerated ranges of the feeding2291\nparticle sizes appropriate for RDF\/SRF46. RDF\/SRF used in the cement industry should be2292\nappropriately small in size to avoid blockage of conveyors. Hard plastic particles should be2293\n<15 mm. In addition, contractual practice for cement kilns shows that the fine fraction2294\n(typically <10 mm particle size) is not favoured to form part of SRF. Two-dimensional SRF2295\nparticles have been specified in a recent UK contract for cement kiln use.2296\n101\nIn fluidised bed gasification at the Ruedersdorf Cement Works, 3-D WDF size2297\nspecifications apply217 (ca. 30 x 10 x 5 mm), as cited in Beckmann and Thom\u00e9-2298\nKozmiensky36. The lowest mean particle size is demanded by the electricity generating2299\nplants designed for pulverised coal, so that the required trajectory in the boiler can be2300\nachieved, incurring more of a cost than a technical challenge205. The J\u00e4nschwalde BCPP2301\nspecifications for SRF are maximum permissible particle size of non-pelletised material 252302\nmm, with 3 % wt. allowance for oversize <50 mm36. The specifications for the Werne HCPP2303\nare higher, with dispersible SRF of particle size <20 mm, suitable for direct injection in to the2304\nfiring process207 (cited in Beckmann and Thom\u00e9-Kozmiensky 36).2305\nThe case of the Nehlsen biodrying plant in Stralsung, Germany, exemplifies the need for2306\nmultiple SRF qualities produced to specifications of different end-users. Three SRF qualities2307\nare produced89: (1) pelletised SRF with bulk densities between 0.25 and 0.35 Mg m-3 and2308\nparticle size <25 mm, suitable for power plants and the cement industry; (2) post-shredded2309\nSRF, with bulk density 0.15-0.25 Mg m-3 and particle size 50-80 mm, for industrial firing2310\nplants; and (3) raw SRF with bulk density 0.15-0.25 Mg m-3 and particle size <200 mm,2311\nintended for the heat and power plant in Stavenhagen.2312\nThe size of RDF pellets was shown to influence the temperature distribution inside the2313\npellet during their combustion in an internal recirculation FBC211. Eco-deco SRF, used in2314\nFBC, has to be shredded to a mean particle size of 100-150 mm5. Circulating fluidised bed2315\ncombustion systems demand a narrow SRF PSD; in the Neumuenster plant, particle sizes2316\n<250 mm are accepted36. Herhof Stabliate\u00ae SRF produced in the Dresden plant is pelletised2317\nin 20 mm, to be used in a methanol production plant218. At the Osnabrueck plant, SRF output2318\nis post-shredded to 40 mm, pelletised in soft pellets and pressed for loading on trucks, for use2319\n102\nin cement kilns219. It has been speculated that the degree of homogeneity of RDF\/SRF can2320\naffect performance of APC equipment present in end-use industries. If greater homogeneity2321\nis achieved, pollutant emission peak loads, typical in thermal recovery of unsorted waste,2322\nmay be significantly reduced164.2323\n5.5. Biogenic content of SRF2324\nAdvances in alternative and renewable energy fuels aim to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and2325\nmitigate the contribution of waste management in global warming potential. As a result, the2326\nbiogenic (or biomass) content of waste included in RDF\/SRF is becoming increasingly2327\nimportant environmental descriptor, reflecting policy and financial drivers179. The draft CEN2328\nstandard (CEN\/TS 15440:2006) defines \u201cbiogenic\u201d as material \u201cproduced in natural2329\nprocesses by living organisms but not fossilised or derived from fossil fuels\u201d75, namely as a2330\ncharacteristic stemming from the origin of the material rather than as a measurable property.2331\nCEN has issued guidance on the relative difference between biogenic and biodegradable2332\nfractions of SRF, which whilst despite largely overlapping should not be treated as identical2333\n(CEN\/TR 14980:2004)220. Determination of the biogenic content of SRF is gradually being2334\nincorporated into standard practice, and could prove critical for its marketability as a quality-2335\ncertified fuel, as well as for earning subsidies. The relative financial importance of biomass2336\ncontent for RDF\/SRF use has been discussed by Juniper5. The wider policy framework for2337\nMBT-derived RDF\/SRF use in Europe has been analysed by Garg et al.23.2338\nIn terms of renewable energy production in the EU, specialists have agreed a minimum2339\n50% biogenic content for MSW-derived RDF\/SRF to qualify as a renewable energy2340\nsource168. However, in the UK, the renewables obligation certificates (ROCs) set the2341\nthreshold values much higher. All electricity that is produced by waste from thermal2342\n103\ntreatment by gasification and pyrolysis qualifies. Additionally, any biogenic percentage of2343\nwaste-derived fuels qualifies for ROC subsidisation in the case of combined heat and power2344\nenergy from waste plants (CHP EfW)221. The overall biogenic content percentage that has to2345\nbe met by a fuel to qualify has been lowered from 98% to 90%, still a challenging target for2346\nMBT-derived SRF, which typically also concentrates high CV materials of fossil fuel origin,2347\nsuch as plastics. A public ROC consultation process was opened with the aim to revisit2348\nprevious decisions, based on a report on carbon balances222 In the US a recent report2349\nprepared by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) has estimated that 56% of the2350\nheating value available in the MSW comes from biogenic sources223.2351\nIn terms of alternative energy sources, carbonaceous emissions released during energy2352\nproduction stemming from the biomass content of fuels are considered as \u201cCO2-neutral\u201d from2353\na global warming potential point of view. Hence, the CO2 emission factor of fuels is based2354\nmerely on the fossil carbon content and the biogenic content is ignored224. This is reflected in2355\nthe EU emission trading scheme (EU-ETS).2356\nStipulations for biomass content of waste-derived fuel in order to qualify for ROCs and2357\nEU-ETS will determine the processing objectives for the biomass fraction in MBT plants.2358\nEnabling implementation could favour concentration of biomass content of residual waste2359\ninto RDF\/SRF. Currently existing measures clearly favour CHP EfW and not the co-2360\ncombustion of RDF\/SRF in conventional electricity generating plants.2361\nScientifically appropriate analytical determination of biogenic content of contaminated2362\nbiomass fuel streams has recently been investigated, with the so called \u201cselective liberation2363\nmethod\u201d being the currently applicable state-of-the-art173, 194. Selective liberation has been2364\nadopted by the CEN QA\/QC guidance as normative, along with the manual sorting method,2365\n104\nand the informative reductionistic method75, 225. CEN has agreed to further develop another2366\navailable method for the determination of biogenic content, the carbon isotope method (\u201c14C2367\nmethod\u201d). It is hoped this will overcome the restrictions faced by the selective liberation2368\nmethod. The 14C method is anticipated by CEN to be standardised in 2008226, with current2369\nprogress summarised in the relevant CEN published document227. It has the relative2370\nadvantage that can be applied to either the fuel itself or the off-gasses produced during the2371\nthermal recovery. The selective liberation method has been the most practiced the previous2372\nyears, as confirmed by Flamme224, who reviewed European methods; and denoted by the2373\nGerman government adopting it for immediate use. In the UK, the DTI\/Ofgem Biomass2374\nFuels Working Group has issued sampling guidance but has not yet adopted a position on the2375\nactual measurement228.2376\nPotential co-combustion of SRF with other fuels (purely fossil or biomass) has led to the2377\ndevelopment of measurement methods applicable at the location of SRF thermal recovery.2378\nFellner et al.229 proposed the determination of biogenic content during EfW co-incineration2379\nusing a model based upon typical process\/ regulatory monitoring data; Mohn et2380\nal.230compared this method with the 14C off-gasses method finding their results in good2381\nagreement. Recently, Staber et al.231 provided an up-to-date comparison of the available2382\nmethods.2383\n5.6. SRF quality management conclusions2384\nThe importance of implementing quality management schemes to the SRF production line of2385\nMBT plants is gaining recognition. The CEN\/TC 343 initiative for harmonisation across2386\nEurope is significant in setting a new benchmark. This is exemplified by the requirements for2387\nrobust sampling plans when dealing with highly heterogeneous material streams such as2388\n105\nresidual waste. Most of the available drafts for development from CEN are still under2389\nvalidation processes. It is necessary to apply the required quality management schemes in a2390\nway that fulfils the intention to avoid duplication of quality control by producers and end-2391\nusers, whilst achieving optimal, scientifically defensible sampling.2392\nSatisfactory understanding of the exact behaviour of MBT-derived SRF during the many2393\navailable thermal recovery processes is still to be gained. This would demand use of2394\ncharacterisation techniques, such as TGA, along with those conventionally used. Biogenic2395\ncontent is becoming an increasingly important descriptor, reflecting the increased recognition2396\nof the potential global warming effect of waste. Accurate determination of biogenic content is2397\nnecessary. Sufficient characterisation and long-term operational data at higher degrees of2398\nsubstitution in co-combustion outlets are necessary in order to estimate the technical2399\nfeasibility for SRF. Such results could result in more detailed and scientifically defensible2400\nspecifications becoming available.2401\nDifferentiation of SRF production to meet specific end-user requirements is also2402\nimperative for the future marketability of SRF. For instance, certain SRF quality criteria for2403\nco-combustion in power plants are higher than those applying for cement kilns. It might be2404\ntechnically (and financially) challenging for many MBT process plants to produce suitably2405\nhigh SRF quality, whether achieving desirable levels of properties or low variability,2406\nespecially for these more demanding applications. From a material flow management point2407\nof view, achieving a lower pollution potential for RDF\/SRF raises the issue of appropriate2408\nintermediate and final sinks for the pollutants that should be directed away from the2409\nRDF\/SRF stream. The inevitable trade-off questions do not have established or unanimously2410\naccepted answers.2411\n106\n2412\n6. MBT-DERIVED RDF\/SRF: QUALITY ACHIEVED2413\n6.1. Introduction2414\nThis review has illustrated the need for quality assured SRF, summarised existing and2415\nupcoming European standards, and the science, environmental engineering and performance2416\nof the main processes from which RDF\/SRF can be produced. In this final section the SRF2417\nquality that has been achieved by European MBT plants is discussed.2418\nMBT-derived RDF\/SRF is poorly characterised, resulting in uncertainty about the quality2419\nachieved. A review of the literature shows that little data is available in the public domain2420\nand from which very few data are reported in peer-reviewed publications. This refers both to2421\nelemental\/substance composition and physical\/biochemical properties, both necessary for2422\nproduct quality assurance, evaluation of its environmental performance, and sustainable2423\nmaterial flow management purposes.2424\nData from available and reliable resources were statistically analysed in an effort to2425\nimprove understanding of RDF\/SRF quality and the magnitude of variation. European data2426\noriginates from MBT plants in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.2427\n6.2. RDF\/SRF produced by biodrying MBT plants2428\n6.2.1. Herhof: Stabilat\u00ae2429\nSRF produced by the Herhof plant in Asslar (FIGURE 16) is used as co-fuel for local2430\ncombustion and district heating systems. SRF from the Rennerod plant is used in cement2431\nkilns and other non-specified co-combustion operations. SRF from Dresden is co-combusted2432\nwith coal for methanol production5.2433\n2434\n107\n<<Figure 16>>2435\n2436\nFIGURE 17 presents PSD data for Stabilat\u00ae (or Trokenstabilat\u00ae, (TST)), derived by sieve2437\nanalysis. It shows that the fractions with particle size lower than 60 mm are largely2438\ndominated by material high in biomass content168. The biomass content on a mass basis2439\nconstitutes 92% of the 3-10 mm, 74% of the 10-25 mm, and 70% of the 25-60 mm. The 60-2440\n250 mm fraction has biomass content lower than 35%. The method for determining the2441\nbiomass content is not mentioned, and so the results should be regarded with some2442\nreservation. Herhof maintains that the native-organic content of Stabilat\u00ae is around 65-70%.2443\n2444\n<<Figure 17 here>>2445\n2446\nThe environmental performance of Stabilat\u00ae in terms of greenhouse gas emissions during2447\ncombustion compares favourably with fossil fuels168. According to Herhof\u2019s results, specific2448\nfossil CO2 emissions of Stabilat\u00ae was 24 gCO2 MJ-1, less than half that of natural gas (562449\ngCO2 MJ-1), which is the fossil fuel with the lowest value. TABLE 15 shows values relevant2450\nto the SRF performance as an alternative fuel, suitable for fossil fuel substitution. FIGURE2451\n18 presents indicative values for the Stabilat\u00ae item composition.2452\n2453\n<<Figure 18>>2454\n2455\n<<Table 17>>2456\n2457\n108\n6.2.2. Nehlsen: Calobren\u00ae2458\nSRF from the Rugen plant is used in a cement kiln. Nehlsen maintains that the measured2459\nvalues for SRF are all less than 75% of the threshold values specified in the cement kiln2460\ncontract5.2461\n6.2.3. Eco-deco SRF2462\nSRF from MBT plants that use the Italian Eco-deco biodrying process is produced in Italy2463\nand the UK. In the London Frog Island plant the 39% w\/w of the input waste is processed into2464\na SRF with NCV of ca 16 KJ kg-1(June 2006 data); higher values up to ca 18.5 KJ kg-1 have2465\nbeen reported for the Italian plants233. SRF is used as a co-fuel in cement kilns and in an on-2466\nsite fluidised bed boiler. SRF specification results from two Italian plants indicate that it2467\ncomplies with the standard class quality of the Italian UNI 9903-3 quality control system5. In2468\nthe UK the SRF outputs have to meet specifications agreed with the specific cement industry2469\nend-users. Ultimate analysis including measurements made at various points during 2003 at2470\nthe Montanaso plant showed mean concentrations of carbon (C) 42.22% w\/w; hydrogen (H)2471\n6.06% w\/w; and nitrogen (N) 0.83% w\/w (basis of reporting, d or ar, not denoted).2472\n6.3. Content of trace elements of concern in SRF2473\nThe quality of MBT-derived SRF has not been extensively evaluated. Rotter et al.492474\ncompared the content of trace elements of concern in SRF from early MBT plants against the2475\nlimit concentrations of the Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forest and Landscape2476\n(BUWAL) standard for cement kilns (FIGURE 19)49.2477\n2478\n<<Figure 19>>2479\n2480\n109\nAlmost all the median values of the examined elements exceed the guide limits, apart2481\nfrom rare elements such as beryllium (Be) and vanadium (V). However, if this SRF was2482\ncompared with other, less strict standards, it would perform much better. For example,2483\naccording to the CEN proposed standards, Hg class code, based merely on median value (80th2484\npercentile were not provided), would be Class 2 (0.02<0.03 mg MJ-1 ar). According to a2485\nCEN published document, a cement kiln may be willing to accept waste up to Hg class code2486\n4196. Careful use of standard is necessary in order to evaluate the suitability of SRF for each2487\nspecific intended use, because every set of limit values serves different purposes and reflects2488\nvarying underlying realties. For example, the BUWAL standard is based on strict2489\nconsiderations regarding cement production material flows. Conversely, the CEN standard2490\nclassification is general and indicative, and has incorporated considerations of the achievable2491\nSRF quality into the proposed limits.2492\n6.4. Comparison of fossil fuel with substituted RDF\/SRF2493\nHeilmann and Bilitewski170 compared coal with RDF produced from German MBT-treated2494\nresidual waste. Gendebien et al.32 compared the toxic load of SRF produced by biodrying in2495\nGermany with other primary and substitute fuels. Heering et al.164 showed that the per2496\nenergy unit generated heavy metal concentrations of the Herhof dry-stabilate and the range of2497\nvalues variation are of the same order of magnitude with certain fossil fuels it substitutes.2498\nStabilat\u00a9 compares favourably in terms of content in trace elements of concern with coal.2499\nHerhof declared an average NCV of 15 MJ kg-1 for the Stabilat\u00a9, rendering it comparable to2500\nthe CV of dried and processed lignite168.2501\n110\n6.5. Statistical analysis of available MBT-derived SRF data-series2502\n6.5.1. Input data quality and SRF statistical analysis limitations2503\nIn this section, statistical analysis of a heterogeneous compilation of existing data on MBT-2504\nderived RDF\/SRF, derived under diverging boundary measurement conditions, is presented.2505\nStatistical analysis is challenging for many reasons, including paucity of data and different2506\nstatistics reported in the literature data (e.g. mean or median to estimate location). TABLE 182507\nsummarises background information on data sources. Available data is mainly found in2508\nreports5, 32, 190, 194, along with a few peer-reviewed publications164, 215, 234. These data series2509\nare mostly derived from quality assurance systems internally implemented by MBT plant2510\noperators to satisfy end-user contractual requirements and\/or to demonstrate compliance with2511\nnational standards. The RDF\/SRF has been produced from varying input materials (different2512\ncountries\/regions and residual or mixed waste collection schemes), treated in MBT plants2513\nwith different design and operational configurations (but predominantly biodrying), prepared2514\nfrom different fractions of the input waste (e.g. partially including or excluding the biomass2515\nfraction), and prepared to different national standards and end-user requirements (mainly2516\ncement kilns, but also dedicated FBC and power plants).2517\n2518\n<<Table 18>>2519\n2520\nDifferent objectives and methodologies applied alongside the entire measurement process,2521\nincluding sampling plans, sub-sampling and sample preparation, analytical determination2522\ntechniques, and dissimilar statistical analysis before final reporting of data in the literature2523\nrestrict the potential for meaningful comparison of data by further statistical analysis.2524\n111\nAdditionally, not all the diversifying methodological details of measurement are clearly2525\nstated for each case. It has been proposed that the number of analyses performed for each2526\ndata series can cautiously be used to guarantee a minimum reliability of the data190. The2527\nmajority of the data sets used in our analysis are based on >10 samples\/analyses (lower limit2528\nproposed by CEN).2529\nThe effect of sampling plans on specific data series is anticipated to be critical, and much2530\nhigher than the uncertainties introduced by differences at the analytical stage. The CEN2531\nguidance for SRF sampling plans237 DD CEN\/TS 15442:2006 incorporated elements of the2532\nlatest developments in Gy\u2019s theory of sampling238-241, developed over the last fifty years242.2533\nEnhanced reliability can be expected for data series that followed the sampling theory, such2534\nas the TAUW investigation194; compliance with national quality assurance systems, such as2535\nthe Italian Eco-deco data5; and constituting average measurements over long time periods2536\n(Nehlsen plant)5; those that have been assessed had independently, such as the Herhof-2537\nStabilate\u00ae SRF, investigated by Niederdr\u00e4nk et al.215.2538\nPublicly available data is statistically analysed to produce the most representative and2539\nthorough overview of the achieved quality by MBT-derived RDF\/SRF to date. Available2540\nstatistics of input data on RDF\/SRF sample properties is largely limited to: (1) measure of2541\n(central) location of the sample population (mean and\/or median); (2) measure of the upper2542\nlimit (80th percentile and\/or max) values; and (3) limited reported values for their spread2543\n(typically in the form of standard deviation).2544\nThe selection and validity of statistical tools for describing properties of waste is highly2545\ndebatable. Certain aspects of the ongoing debate are addressed by van Tubergen et al.190 and2546\nPehlken et al.78. Simplifying, it can be generally assumed that population distributions (or2547\n112\nprobability density function curves) for many of the properties of waste-derived products2548\nexhibit skewness and lengthy distribution tails (long-tailedness)78. Typically positive2549\nskewness is evident.2550\nDuring the pre-normative research for CEN SRF standards TAUW investigated the type2551\nof statistical distribution that is suitable to describe the properties of SRF. The study included2552\noutputs from biodrying plants and from mechanical sorting of the high CV fraction of2553\nresidual waste, analysing 35 samples for each case. Results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test2554\nfor Cl, Hg, Cu, and Cr have shown that for both plant cases the type of distribution that best2555\nfits these properties was log-normal rather than normal, with the exception of Hg for2556\nbiodrying which was normally distributed194. However, the CEN technical committee draft2557\nhas opted for Cl to be classified by the mean rather than the median, implying a normal2558\ndistribution would suffice; indeed there is a certain degree of overlap between the two forms2559\nof distribution. Conversely, Hg has to be classified according to both median and 80th2560\npercentile values, implying that a skewed long-tailed distribution is anticipated.2561\nOther data reported on SRF from Eco-deco and Nehlsen biodrying processes 5 indirectly2562\nverify that many properties are not fully normally distributed. Data series for which values2563\nfor both mean and median are available show varying degrees of difference between these2564\ntwo statistics, establishing that their distributions are skewed, hence not normal. For instance,2565\nPb and Cr show clear positive skewness in all three available data sets; whilst Hg shows2566\nmixed behaviour, including one case of negative skewness.2567\nThe central trend and the spread of the values for each property are estimated by2568\ncalculating and graphically presenting in box-plots the minimum, lower quartile, median,2569\nupper quartile and maximum value for both median and 80th percentile of input data.2570\n113\nCalculations and graphics were made with Statistica 8\u00ae243, following typical box-plot2571\nconvetions (see FIGURE 20). Preferably statistical analysis should be performed only on2572\nmedian and 80th percentile input SRF data statistics, but in practice means were also used to2573\nindicate the location. Median and 80th percentile are measures of location and upper values2574\nrespectively, independent of the form of distribution and robust to outliers. They are2575\ntherefore suitable to describe properties of RDF\/SRF that show log-normal distribution or2576\nskewness and longtailedness in general. In the case of normally distributed property, median2577\nis identical to the arithmetic mean. High percentiles, like the 80th percentile, are particularly2578\nuseful for estimating the upper values of concentrations of trace metals of concern (e.g. Cd),2579\nas demanded in practice. The alternative would be to employ data points that are statistics2580\nbased on normally distributed populations (arithmetic mean, standard deviation etc);2581\nhowever, this assumption does not hold for many of the waste measurands, especially for2582\nanalytes expected to be present at trace concentrations.2583\nHowever, median values were not available for all the cases; as a compromise mean2584\nvalues were also used to indicate the location of input data series. For properties that exhibit2585\npositive skewness, the overall average central trend of the median values is biased towards2586\nhigher values when means are used instead of medians. However, the differences between2587\nmedians and means, despite evidence for non-symmetrically distributed properties, are not2588\nsignificant in all cases, as shown by the cases for which comparative data are available. The2589\nnumber of means used instead of medians for each property are shown in TABLE 19. For Pb2590\nonly mean values were used, as there were very limited median values. Given that Pb exhibits2591\npositive skewness, the average location of Pb is then overestimated.2592\n114\nThe significance of the results is also restricted by the fact that data series of different2593\nreliability are given equal, non-weighed treatment (e.g. values resulting from long and short2594\ntime series results); and by the low number of available data-series on RDF\/SRF properties,2595\nranging from 14 to 4 (properties with fewer data points available are not analysed). As2596\nreceived (ar) values were converted to dry basis (d) for the properties necessary to do so, by2597\nusing the median(\/mean) moisture content values, where available. As received net calorific2598\nvalues were transformed into dry basis by applying the proposed CEN formula244for the2599\ncalculation of analyses to different bases245. This has rendered certain NCV (d) to be much2600\nhigher than values reported in the literature (e.g. Eco-deco values5), possibly calculated by a2601\ndifferent conversion formula. Nevertheless, given the limitations, calculation of medians and2602\nuse of box-plots can provide the most appropriate, accurate and clearly presented account for2603\nthe RDF\/SRF properties.2604\n6.5.2. Results and discussion of statistical analysis on MBT-derived RDF\/SRF2605\nproperties2606\nResults related to key technical, environmental and economic aspects of RDF\/SRF quality are2607\nsummarised in TABLE 19. Box-plots are used to graphically represent the main findings2608\n(FIGURE 20- FIGURE 26).2609\n2610\n<<Table 19 >>2611\n2612\n<<Figures 20-26>>2613\n2614\nResults were generally within the expected range and are logically consistent. The 80th2615\npercentile values are higher than the median values, with certain exceptions, such as the2616\n115\nmaximum values of Hg reported on a mass basis. Coefficients of variation (CV) (%) are2617\ncalculated for each statistic to estimate the scale-free dispersion of the analysed populations.2618\nThe CV ranged from 13.1% for the location of NCV ar, to 95.9% for the location of Cu.2619\nThe location of median NCV ar (FIGURE 20) falls within the range of Class 3 of the2620\nproposed CEN classes, with the lower and upper quartiles being at 15.4 MJ kg-1 ar and 16.82621\nMJ kg-1 ar respectively, showing a narrow spread. The location of MC medians (FIGURE2622\n21) is at 13.4% w\/w ar, with the maximum value being more than three times the interquartile2623\nrange higher than the upper quartile (Q3= 14.2% w\/w ar) and hence depicted as an extreme2624\nvalue (star) in the box-plot. The ash content location of medians (FIGURE 21) is at 21.1%2625\nw\/w, but the upper quartile reaches as high as 25.1% w\/w, which can be uninviting for the2626\nmost demanding end-uses of RDF\/SRF.2627\nThe Cl content quality achieved by MBT-derived SRF appears generally good (FIGURE2628\n22), but this result should be cautiously interpreted. The central trend of Cl content median2629\nvalues is at 0.50% w\/w d; a hypothetical SRF with the same value would be classified as Cl2630\nclass 2. The maximum reported location value is at 1.05% w\/w d. However, the data series2631\nincluded RDF\/SRF with unexpectedly low location values for Cl, especially for2632\nmeasurements reported on a dry basis and stemming from plants that do have not yet2633\nincorporated sophisticated sorting (e.g. NIR) to screen out high-Cl components: the minimum2634\nbeing at 0.29% w\/w d. Detailed calculations by Schirmer et al.246 established that the average2635\ntotal Cl content (TCC) in MBT-derived RDF\/SRF produced from residual MSW can be2636\nanticipated to fall in the range of 0.6-0.8% w\/w d. Anticipated values for RDF\/SRF produced2637\nfrom biodrying plant configurations are ca. 0.1% w\/w d higher than values for MBT plants2638\nthat just separate mechanically RDF\/SRF before biological treatment246. We speculate that2639\n116\nthe unexpectedly low values reported in the literature could reflect difficulties in the sampling2640\nmethods and analytical measurements used. Schirmer et al.167 have pointed out the particular2641\nchallenge of determining total chlorine. Importantly, they stressed that combustion digestion2642\nmethods underestimate the inorganic portion of Cl in samples with high ash content, which is2643\nproblematic for QA\/QC purposes.2644\nThe data indicate that the content of MBT-derived RDF\/SRF in trace elements of concern2645\n(often called \u201cheavy metals\u201d) is generally acceptable in most of the cases (FIGURE 23-26).2646\nThis can be illustrated by comparing the upper quartile of the location data for trace elements2647\n(range that includes the 75% of the population values, from low to high) with, for example,2648\nthe German limits for SRF186 ): As: Q3[As]=3.4 mg kg-1 d < German limit=5 mg kg-1 d; Cd:2649\nQ3[Cd]= 2.2 mg kg-1 d < German limit=4 mg kg-1 d; Cr: Q3[Cr]=90 mg kg-1 d < German2650\nlimit=125 mg kg-1 d; Ni: Q3[Ni]=40 mg kg-1 d < German limit=80 mg kg-1 d. From the2651\nelements for which sufficient data series existed for statistical analysis, only Cu (Q3[Cu]=2652\n448 mg kg-1 d < German limit=350 mg kg-1 d), and Pb (Q3[Pb]=208 mg kg-1 d < German2653\nlimit=190 mg kg-1 d) upper quartiles of location exceed the limits. The spread of the Cu2654\nvalues reported in the literature is much higher than that of Cr, as can be seen from their2655\ninterquartile ranges in FIGURE 23. For data regarding each plant the 80th percentile values2656\nare considerably higher than the median in many cases. This could verify the need to resort2657\nto statistical description and classification of trace element content with an indication of both2658\nlocation (median) and upper values (80th percentile).2659\nHowever, this is slightly less evident for Hg. Reported on mass basis (FIGURE 25), the2660\nlocation of medians is at 0.46 mg kg-1 d and location of 80th percentile at 0.53 mg kg-1 d.2661\nReported on an energy basis (FIGURE 26), in agreement with the CEN classification system,2662\n117\nlocation of Hg medians is at 0.023 mg MJ-1 ar and location of 80th percentiles is at 0.024 mg2663\nMJ-1 ar, showing unexpectedly similar values. This may be due to fewer data points for the2664\n80th percentile. Hence, an equivalent imaginary SRF with same median and 80th percentile2665\nvalues would be cautiously classified as CEN Hg class 2, which is towards the high end of2666\npossible qualities.2667\n2668\n7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS2669\nA significant objective for MBT is to achieve effective material flow management of residual2670\nwaste that involves extracting homogeneous fractions of known biochemical composition.2671\nThe benefits of this are twofold: to concentrate contaminants separately and direct them2672\ntowards appropriate onward disposal or treatment mechanisms; and to produce recyclates to a2673\ndesired quality, prolonging their residence time in the anthroposphere.2674\n7.1 Appropriate descriptors for evaluating unit process operations2675\nSince MBT is a generic process that can be broken down into many process unit operations, it2676\nis important to understand, through characterisation studies, the relative contribution that2677\neach unit makes by using appropriate descriptors. Conventional descriptors such as yield and2678\npurity of waste components have typically have been applied. PSD, if used appropriately, can2679\nbe useful in describing comminution results and for modelling size-dependent mechanical2680\nprocessing. The move from a predominantly disposal-led waste sector to one that is more2681\nresource based, demands the use of analytical tools such as MFA. MFA, via TCs and MECs,2682\ncan provide the ability to map flows of preserved properties of waste, such as trace elements,2683\ninto the output fractions. This can enable the optimisation of MBT processes to effectively2684\nseparate waste fractions into outputs of desired quality e.g. known chemical composition.2685\n118\nThis is of value to waste companies because it provides the basis for a targeted reduction in2686\npollution load of MBT outputs that potentially has a positive effect on end-user emissions.2687\n7.2 Performance of process units and implications for output quality and MBT design2688\nMFA has recently been employed to accurately map and predict behaviour of MBT plants.2689\nDespite some very promising experimental results reported in recent studies, most of the data2690\ncomes from theoretical investigations. There is a need for additional experimental MFA2691\nresearch on a test scale and full commercial basis.2692\nMFA data have so far demonstrated the difficulty in achieving effective chemical2693\nseparation solely by mechanical means. The recent application of additional processing2694\ntechnology combined with mechanical methods in MBT plants, such as NIR sorting, 3-stage2695\nballistic separators and x-ray sorting, offers a significant opportunity to improve this2696\nsituation.2697\nThere is invariably a trade off between achieving a high quality of recoverable outputs2698\nand the properties of reject material e.g. RDF\/SRF with a low Cl content can result in a2699\nsignificant yield of rejects that require subsequent treatment or disposal. The selection of2700\nintermediate and final sinks of materials diverted away from RDF\/SRF production therefore2701\nneeds careful consideration. Adittionally, attempting to produce SRF of higher specifications2702\nand more consistent quality may demand resorting in more energy demanding plant2703\nconfigurations, adversely affecting the sustainability of such choices.2704\nRecent studies have provided results for particular aspects of process unit operations.2705\nBiodrying systems appear to offer the advantage of optimally preparing the waste for2706\nmechanical treatment. Promising results for selective comminution and fast biodegradation2707\nwere achieved by ball-mill pre-treatment. Zn and Cl in particular are difficult to dilute in2708\n119\nRDF\/SRF produced from residual MSW because of their highly diffused distribution in waste2709\ncomponents. There is a need for careful selection of unit operations, their arrangement in the2710\nflow line and improvements in their design or use of new developments to achieve higher2711\nquality recoverable outputs. For example, with the objective of high-grade SRF production, it2712\nis not sufficient to separate a comminuted coarse fraction just on a PSD basis.2713\n7.3 Quality management for SRF production2714\nThe importance of implementing quality management schemes to the SRF production line of2715\nMBT plants is gaining recognition. The CEN\/TC 343 initiative for harmonisation across2716\nEurope is significant in setting a new benchmark, but still under validation.2717\nWhen dealing with highly heterogeneous material streams such as residual waste or SRF,2718\nthe adoption of robust standardised sampling plans based on established sampling theory that2719\ntakes account of the inherent heterogeneity of waste materials is vital.2720\nDifferentiation of SRF production to meet specific end-user requirements is vital for the2721\nfuture marketability of SRF due to the different needs of end-users e.g. certain SRF quality2722\ncriteria for co-combustion in power plants are higher than those applying to SRF-dedicated2723\nthermal recovery facilities such as gasification plants. A satisfactory understanding of the2724\nexact behaviour of MBT-derived SRF during the many available thermal recovery processes2725\nis still to be gained. Sufficient characterisation and long-term operational data at higher2726\ndegrees of SRF substitution as an alternative fuel in co-combustion outlets are necessary in2727\norder to estimate the technical feasibility for SRF. Such results could inform the debate2728\nsurrounding specifications.2729\nBiogenic content is becoming an increasingly important descriptor, reflecting the2730\nincreased recognition of the potential global warming effect of waste. There is a need to2731\n120\nstandardise the measurement methodology before biogenic content can be determined2732\naccurately. Data produced from validated methodologies could support scientifically sound2733\nregulation.2734\n7.4 Statistical analysis for MBT-derived SRF2735\nResults from literature data on MBT-derived RDF\/SRF were generally within the expected2736\nrange and logically consistent. SRF achieved quality could potentially prove able to respond2737\nto legislative and market needs if improvements are achieved e.g. reduction of the Cl content.2738\nCoefficient of variation ranged from 13% to 96%, which reasonably reflect the variability in2739\nSRF production, properties and measurement conditions.2740\nThe location of median net calorific values (ar) falls within the range of Class 3 of the2741\nproposed CEN classes, showing a narrow spread. The ash content location of medians is at2742\n21% w\/w, but the upper quartile reaches as high as 25% w\/w, which is less appealing to the2743\nmost demanding end-users of RDF\/SRF. The Cl content appears generally good; the central2744\ntrend of Cl content median values is at 0.5% w\/w d. However, we speculate that the2745\nunexpectedly low values reported in the literature could reflect unresolved issues related to2746\nsampling plans and the analytical methods used. Reported data indicate that the content of2747\ntrace elements in MBT-derived RDF\/SRF is generally acceptable in most cases (within end-2748\nuser specifications or regulatory limits). From the elements for which sufficient data series2749\nexisted to enable statistical analysis, only Cu and Pb showed a high potential to exceed the2750\nGerman specification limits.2751\n7.5 General evaluation2752\nMost of the unit operations currently used in MBT plants have an established track record.2753\nThe waste input materials, specific MBT plant objectives and output requirements have2754\n121\nevolved considerably since the earlier RDF plants and associated \u201cdirty\u201d composting plants2755\nthat relied on mechanical processing. However insufficient scientifically-derived data is2756\navailable in the public domain on the performance of individual process unit operations that2757\nwould inform the design of MBT plants to meet the needs of the modern sustainable resource2758\nmanagement agenda.2759\nMixed MSW is a challenging waste stream for waste treatment processes such as MBT.2760\nHowever, through improved upstream source separation (e.g. removal of dry recyclates, food2761\nwaste or green waste for composting), segregation and recognition of changing waste2762\nstreams, the properties of residual MSW are changing significantly. The biodegradable2763\ncontent for example may be expected to significantly reduce during the next 10 years. This2764\nwill have an impact on the performance of MBT systems that are yet to demonstrate an2765\nability to adapt.2766\nThis review relates to material flow management. However, there are important wider2767\nconsiderations to be made. MBT is generally a highly mechanised process that is energy2768\nintensive. A wider sustainability appraisal of MBT performance, compared with alternative2769\ntechnologies such as anaerobic digestion, therefore warrants investigation to consider issues2770\nsuch as energy consumption, emissions and value in materials recovery.2771\nAdditional data on specific material properties (e.g. physical properties) are needed to2772\nbuild confidence on MBT-derived SRF as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Further research2773\nis needed to enhance our understanding of what constitutes appropriate data at the operational2774\nand regulatory level and suitable statistical analysis for MBT-derived SRF and other waste-2775\nderived products to enable appropriate and harmonised reporting in the future. The2776\nperformance of MBT systems requires continued scrutiny to establish a viable waste2777\n122\ntreatment technology for improved handling of material flows in accordance with sustainable2778\nresource management.2779\n8.
