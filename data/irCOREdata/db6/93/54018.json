In an inclusion task participants aimed to complete \nthree-letter word stems with a previously studied word, in an exclusion task the aim was \nto avoid using studied words to complete stems.  Performances under inclusion and \nexclusion conditions were contrasted to obtain estimates of controlled and automatic \nmemory processes using process-dissociation calculations (Jacoby, 1991).   \nAn age-related decline, evident from middle age was observed for the estimate of \ncontrolled processing, whereas the estimate of automatic processing remained invariant \nacross the age groups. This pattern stands in contrast to what is observed in AD, where \nboth controlled and automatic processes have been shown to be impaired.  Therefore, the \nimpairment in memory processing on stem completion that is found in AD is \nqualitatively different from that observed in normal ageing.  \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \nStudies of stem completion in the normal elderly and in individuals with \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) typically deploy task dissociation methods that assume explicit \n(e.g. cued recall) and implicit (e.g. word stem completion) memory tests are mediated by \ncontrolled and automatic retrieval processes respectively.  In these paradigms patients \nwith AD relative to elderly controls (Carlesimo et al., 1995; Partridge et al., 1990), and \nolder adults relative to younger adults (Mitchell and Bruss, 2003; Ryan et al., 2001) show \nreliable deficits on cued recall tasks, which is assumed to reflect a normal age-related \nimpairment in controlled retrieval processes that is exacerbated in AD.  In contrast, the \nstatus of automatic retrieval processes in both groups is equivocal since intact (AD: \nDeweer et al., 1994; Partridge et al., 1990; normal aged: Clarys et al., 2000; Mitchell and \nBruss, 2003) and impaired (AD: Carlesimo et al., 1995; Russo and Spinnler, 1994; \nnormal aged: Davis et al., 1990; Hultsch et al., 1999) word stem completion rates have \nbeen reported.    \nIn recent years, the validity of using implicit test performance as an index of \nautomatic processing has been questioned (Reingold and Toth, 1996) on the basis that \nconscious uses of memory may be facilitative (Jacoby, 1991; Jennings and Jacoby, 1993; \nToth et al., 1994).  If conscious contamination occurs it is plausible that reduced stem \ncompletion rates observed in AD patients and in the normal elderly may not actually \nreflect reduced automatic memory processes per se, but arise from the greater capacity of \ncontrol subjects to use intentional memory processes.  Although attempts have been made \nto manipulate the degree of contamination on stem completion (Chiarello and Hoyer, \n1988; Habib et al., 1996; Mitchell and Bruss, 2003), the process-dissociation procedure \n(Jacoby, 1991; Jacoby et al., 1993; Toth et al., 1994)\n1\n offers a direct method for obtaining \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \nseparate estimates of automatic and controlled processing within a task and is therefore \nuseful for comparing the processing changes that occur through normal ageing with those \nassociated with pathological ageing.    \nIn the stem completion process-dissociation method (e.g. Jacoby et al., 1993; Toth \net al., 1994) subjects are instructed to use stems as a cue to recall a studied word, and \nthen either use that word (inclusion condition) or use an alternative word (exclusion \ncondition) to complete the stem. Under inclusion conditions the probability of completing \na stem with a studied word is due to the additive probabilities of controlled memory \nprocessing (C) plus automatic influences of memory (A) when conscious recollection \nfails (1 \u2013 C).  Under exclusion conditions this probability is due to automatic processes \n(A) plus a failure of conscious recollection (1 \u2013 C).  Estimates of controlled memory \nprocesses are derived from the difference in stem completion rates between inclusion and \nexclusion conditions; estimates of automatic uses of memory are computed by the \ncalculation: exclusion\/(1 \u2013 C).  \nRecently, Hudson and Robertson (2007) deployed the process-dissociation \nprocedure to examine the contribution of automatic and controlled uses of memory to a \nstem completion task in AD.  The results showed deficient stem completion rates in AD, \nwhich was determined by a profound impairment in controlled memory processing \ntogether with a reduced level of automatic memory processing (see also Knight, 1998; \nSmith and Knight, 2002).  The current study aimed to directly extend these findings by \nusing the same materials and procedure to examine how the pattern of impairment in \nmemory processing found in AD differs from normal age-related changes.  Variations of \nprocess-dissociation have been used in a few ageing studies and normal ageing has been \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \nfound to reduce the contribution of controlled memory processes to source recognition \n(Jennings and Jacoby, 1993; Titov and Knight, 1997) and stem completion (Salthouse et \nal., 1997; Schmitter-Edgecombe, 1999; Zelazo et al., 2004), but in contrast to AD leave \nestimates of automatic processes invariant.  However, comparisons between the \nprocessing changes in retrieval that occur with normal ageing and those found in AD \nhave so far relied on drawing conclusions across studies that have used different \nprocedures and different materials.  Automatic processes are not constant but should be \nregarded as context-dependent (Neumann, 1984) and therefore determined by the \nparameters of the task (Jacoby, 1991).  By using the same methods as Hudson and \nRobertson (2007), this study rules out between-study differences as a possible confound, \nand enables a direct comparison between normal ageing and AD to be made on the same \nstem completion task.  In addition, in this study middle-aged adults were also included to \nsee whether age-related changes in processing progress uniformly across the adult life \nspan or whether there is a threshold effect.  \n  \nMethod   \nSubjects:  Forty-eight adults participated in the study, 16 from each of three age \nbands (19-39; 40-59; 60-78); these consisted of undergraduate students, academic and \nnon-academic university staff and people living in the Lincolnshire community.  The \nmean age of each group was 26 years (SD = 7.1, 9 female, 7 male), 48 years (SD = 4.4, \n10 female, 6 male) and 69 years (SD = 3.8, 10 female, 6 male) respectively.  Based on the \nNational Adult Reading Test (Nelson 1982) the average estimated FSIQ for each group \nwas, 117.63 (SD = 4.28) for young subjects, 119.87 (SD = 4.08) for middle-aged subjects \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \nand 116.81 (SD = 4.48) for older subjects.  The older adults all obtained a score of 27 or \nabove on the Mini Mental Status Examination (Folstein et al., 1975).  The data of 16 AD \npatients reported by Hudson and Robertson (2007) were included in the study.  This \ncohort met the clinical criteria for probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984; Morris et al., \n1989), they had a mean age of 68 years (SD = 10.1, 8 female, 8 male) and a mean MMSE \nof 18.4 (SD = 3.3).  \n  \nStimuli:  The stimuli and procedure were the same as those described by Hudson \nand Robertson (2007).  In brief, the stimulus set consisted of four blocks of 12 words (5-7 \nletters in length); each word had a unique three-letter stem within the set.  The blocks \nwere rotated to allow each stem to correspond equally to a studied or unstudied word in \ninclusion and exclusion test conditions.  All stimuli were printed on cards.   \n   \nProcedure:  Subjects were tested individually, first under inclusion conditions \nthen under exclusion conditions.  The basic study-test format for both conditions was \nidentical.  At study, subjects read aloud words from one block (plus 6 buffer words).  At \ntest, two blocks of word stems (one studied, one new) were presented in a pseudorandom \norder.  Under inclusion conditions subjects tried to complete stems with a studied word, \nunder exclusion conditions they tried to use an alternative word.  Following the \nexperiment, the NART was administered; older adults also completed the MMSE.   \n  \nResults   \nThe proportion of stems completed with target words were entered into separate \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \none-way ANOVA\u2019s (see Table 1).  For the inclusion task, younger subjects produced \nmore target completions than older subjects [F (2, 45) = 8.56, p < .001], the middle-aged \ngroup was intermediate and did not differ significantly.  For the exclusion task, both \nyounger and middle-aged subjects produced less target completions than older subjects [F \n(2, 45) = 20.42, p < .0001].  A 3 \u00d7 2 ANOVA which treated Group (young, middle-age, \nold) as a between-subjects factor and Condition (inclusion or exclusion) as a within-\nsubjects factor showed that the proportion of base rate responses, and therefore response \ncriterion did not vary between tasks or group (all F\u2019s < 1).   \n[INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]  \nEstimates derived from the process-dissociation calculations revealed an age-\nrelated decline in controlled processing [F (2, 45) = 26.72, p < .0001); younger adults \ndisplayed greater control than middle-aged adults (p < .01), who in turn displayed greater \ncontrol than older adults (p < .0001).  In contrast, age did not impair automatic memory \nprocesses [F (2, 45) < 1].  Relative to data from AD patients, the normal aged produced \nmore target completions under inclusion [t (30) = 5.88, p < .0001] and less under \nexclusion conditions [t (30) = 2.04, p < .05].  Patients with AD were impaired in both \ncontrolled [t (30) = 6.55, p < .0001] and automatic memory processes [t (30) = 3.22, p < \n.003].   \n  \nDiscussion  \nThis study used the process-dissociation procedure to measure controlled and \nautomatic retrieval processes in young, middle-aged and older adults, and compared these \nestimates with existing data from patients with AD, to examine whether changes in \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \nmemory processing due to pathological ageing are qualitatively different to normal age-\nrelated changes.  Relative to younger and middle-aged adults, older adults completed less \nstems with target words under inclusion conditions, but produced more target \ncompletions under exclusion conditions.  This pattern parallels the performance of AD \npatients relative to age-matched controls (Hudson and Robertson, 2007; Knight, 1998; \nKoivisto et al., 1998), and as indicated by the NART scores did not arise from a decline \nin verbal competence.  The estimates derived from the process-dissociation calculations \nconfirmed that the reduction in cued recall with age was entirely attributable to an age-\nrelated deficit in controlled memory processing which was detectable from middle-age.  \nThe availability of automatic processes remained invariant between age groups \n(Schmitter-Edgecombe, 1999; Zelazo et al., 2004).  Importantly, these estimates are not \nlikely to be due to a differential response bias since the proportion of base rate \ncompletions did not differ between groups or across inclusion and exclusion conditions. \nTo date, very few studies have used process-dissociation methods to examine \ncontrolled and automatic processing in middle-aged adults.  However, the study of this \ngroup and indeed additional age cohorts is important for understanding the relationship \nbetween adult age and memory processing across the life span.  Data from the middle-\naged group reported here concurs with Titov and Knight (1997), indicating that \nimpairments in controlled retrieval processes in older adults do not have a sudden onset \nbut occur in a continuous manner across the adult life span.  The finding that the \ncontribution of controlled memory processes to stem completion declines with normal \nageing and is further exacerbated in AD, whereas automatic memory processes are \nunaffected by normal ageing but decline in AD\n3\n, has also been shown through the \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \ncombined findings of Schmitter-Edgecombe (1999), Zelazo et al., (2004) and Knight \n(1998).  This pattern is also consistent with task dissociation studies which have shown \nthat manipulations which reduce the potential for conscious contamination decrease the \ndifference between completion rates of older and younger adults (Chiarello and Hoyer, \n1988; Habib et al., 1996; Mitchell and Bruss, 2003), but do not effect the difference in \ncompletion rates between patients with AD and healthy older adults (Meiran and Jelicic, \n1995).  But notably, these conclusions are drawn from different studies that have used \ndifferent materials and test characteristics.  However, memory processes are specific to \nelements of the task (Neumann, 1984) and can fluctuate according to experimental \ndemands (Jacoby, 1991).  An important contribution of the present study is that any \npotential between-task confounds have been eliminated because both pathological and \nhealthy participants were administered the same task.  \nThe dissociation between AD patients and elderly controls in automatic \nprocessing indicates that the nature of the stem completion impairment found in AD is \nqualitatively different to that observed in normal ageing.  If a dimensional model of AD \nis accepted (e.g. Huppert, 1994), automatic memory processing may be a discriminating \nentity on a continuum from normal ageing through to AD.  Further, the status of \nautomatic processes may help discriminate between patients with AD from other memory \nimpaired groups in which automatic memory processes are intact.  These include \nindividuals with depression (Jermann et al., 2005), or with non-dementing forms of \namnesia (Cermak et al., 1992).  \nThe finding that automatic memory processes are impaired in AD but intact in \nnormal ageing on the stem completion task used here, is not necessarily a pattern that \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \nwould generalize to other tasks.    Although there are no reports of impaired automatic \nprocessing in normal ageing (but see La Voie and Light, 1994; Light et al., 2000) \nnumerous reports of normal implicit memory performance on a range of tasks contends \nthat under certain conditions automatic memory processes are available to AD patients \n(see Fleischman and Gabrieli, 1998).  Hypotheses regarding the specificity of automatic \nprocessing in AD and normal ageing do need to be directly tested.  Indeed, not all \nprocess-dissociation studies involving patients with AD have reported impaired \nautomatic processing.  Both Koivisto et al. (1998) and more recently Adam et al. (2005) \nfound that patients with AD had deficits in controlled memory processes but preserved \nautomatic memory processes, which would suggest that the processing impairment in AD \nonly differs quantitatively to normal age-related changes.  There are however, two \ncaveats that question this conclusion.  First, in Koivisto et al. (1998) the validity of the \nautomatic estimates is uncertain as there was variance in the base rate completions \nbetween inclusion and exclusion conditions.  In Hudson and Robertson (2007) base rate \ncompletions were comparable.  Second, in Adam et al. (2005) a highly significant \nnegative correlation between automatic memory processes and dementia severity was \nfound, indicating that automatic memory processes may be preserved in the earlier stages \nbut are susceptible to the progression of AD.  This finding may account for the \ninconsistency between that study and Hudson and Robertson (2007) where the MMSE \nmeans for the AD sample were 21.6 (mild) and 18.4 (moderate ~70% < 21) respectively.  \nIn sum, the findings from this study and Hudson and Robertson (2007) show that \nthe stem completion deficit in AD is qualitatively different to that observed in healthy \nolder adults relative to younger adults.  Whereas normal ageing produces impairments in \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \ncontrolled uses of memory which are notable in middle-age, in AD both controlled and \nautomatic processing is impaired.  In addition to being theoretically relevant, the status of \nautomatic processing in AD may have clinical relevance and help differentiate between \nnormal age-related and pathological memory impairment.      \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \nFootnotes  \n1\n The validity of the process-dissociation estimates depends on the assumption that \ncontrolled and automatic memory processes are independent.  This assumption and other \nissues of contention relating to the procedure have been debated elsewhere and will not \nbe discussed in detail here (see Curran and Hintzman, 1995; Graf and Komatsu, 1994; \nJacoby, 1998; Reingold and Toth, 1996; Richardson-Klavehn et al., 1996).  \n  \n2\nThe finding that AD reduces automatic uses of memory may explain why the stem \ncompletion rates by patients with AD tend to be lower than other amnesic patients who \nhave more circumscribed lesions (Gabrieli et al., 1994) and do not exhibit an impairment \nin automatic memory processing (Cermak et al., 1992).  \n  \n3\nEvidence from PET studies may help to explain the neural basis for this pattern.  \nDeploying controlled memory processes has been shown to robustly increase activation \nof the frontal cortex (Schacter et al., 1996), and marked pathological changes to the \nfrontal lobes occur through normal ageing (Albert and Killinay, 2001; Fuster, 1989), and \nstill more extensively in AD (DeKosky and Scheff, 1990).  In contrast, word stem \ncompletion has been associated with reductions in occipital activation, which purportedly \nreflects the less effortful and more automatic reprocessing of studied stimuli (Squire et \nal., 1992; Schacter et al., 1996).  This particular property has been observed in healthy \nolder adults (B\u00e4ckman et al., 1997) but is abnormal in AD (B\u00e4ckman et al., 2000).  \n     \nAutomatic memory in ageing and AD \nTable 1.
