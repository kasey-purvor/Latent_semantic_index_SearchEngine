Introduction\n[2] Black aurora is recognized as a spatially well defined\nregion within uniform diffuse aurora that lacks optical\nemissions [Royrvik, 1976; Davis, 1978]. These black\nregions can be broadly categorised into two groups; those\nassociated with shear motions, which often evolve into\nblack vortex streets [Kimball and Hallinan, 1998b], and\nblack patches which are not associated with shear [Kimball\nand Hallinan, 1998a].\n[3] Black aurora exhibit a variety of forms, from curls\nand vortex streets (with a sense of rotation opposite to that\nof auroral curls [Hallinan and Davis, 1970]), to elliptical\nand stretched patches (black arcs) [Trondsen and Cogger,\n1997; Marklund et al., 1997; Kimball and Hallinan, 1998a,\n1998b]. Mapped to an altitude of 100 km, black patches are\ntypically around 5 \u0002 1 km in extent, are common in the late\nrecovery phase of an auroral substorm, and move predom-\ninately in the eastward direction with a speed of 1 to 2 km\/s.\n[4] Black vortex structures are understood to be due to\ndownward field-aligned currents (FACs) within regions of\nnarrow diverging electric fields [Royrvik, 1976;Marklund et\nal., 1997], that is, similar, but opposite, to auroral curls.\nHowever, our understanding of non-sheared black aurora is\nless well established. To date no simultaneous optical and\nin-situ radar observations of black aurora exists, and the\ngeneration mechanism for non-sheared black aurora is still\nunder debate. Recent observations by Peticolas et al. [2002]\nindicate that black patches are found within narrow regions\nwhere the loss cone is partially empty of energies larger than\n2 keV, and they suggest that where scattering into the loss\ncone is locally hindered, black aurora occurs. This means\nthat black aurora are not associated with downward FAC\u2019s\nbut merely the lack of precipitating electrons.\n[5] As explained in section 4, it is likely that a downward\ncurrent within the black aurora would lower the ionospheric\ndensity. We present observations of black patches from a\ncoordinated optical-radar experiment during the evening of\n5 March 2002 from EISCAT, Troms\u00f8, where we searched\nfor any such density depletions within black aurora using\nincoherent scatter radar measurements of plasma density\ncombined with an auroral imager to determine the position\nof the black patches. These are the first reported observa-\ntions of black aurora using incoherent backscatter radar.\n2. Instrumentation\n[6] EISCAT (the European Incoherent Scatter radar) in\nTroms\u00f8 (69.58\u0002N, 19.22\u0002E) was used for direct observa-\ntions of ionospheric electron density. EISCAT was pointing\nalong the local magnetic field line, and ran the tau3\nprogramme, which yields a time resolution of 5 s, and an\nunambiguous range resolution of 5.4 km. The radar beam\nhas a full opening angle of about 0.6\u0002, which corresponds to\nabout 1 km at the altitude of typical auroras (105 km).\n[7] For visual observations of the black patches the\nOptical digital imager (Odin) of University of Troms\u00f8 was\nused. The video signal is digitized in real time and syn-\nchronized through GPS satellites to achieve exact timing. A\nF0.95 50 mm lens was used, which yields a 14.3 \u0002 10.9\u0002\nfield of view.\n3. Observations\n[8] The Odin imager and the EISCAT radar was running\nin parallel on the evening of 5 March 2002, when several\nblack arcs where observed between 2000 and 2100 UT.\nGeomagnetic activity was high (Kp = 5), and the observa-\ntions took place after an auroral breakup which terminated\nat around 1930 UT.\n[9] Between 2004:11 and 2004:30 (event A), and\n2013:53 and 2014:46 UT (event B) black arcs were seen\nto enter the radar beam. The black arc in event A was about\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 31, L06813, doi:10.1029\/2003GL019244, 2004\nCopyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/04\/2003GL019244$05.00\nL06813 1 of 4\n1.5 km wide, and moved southward at \u00010.1 km\/s. The\nblack arc in event B moved slowly northward (\u00010.05 km\/s),\nand deformed slightly from being \u00012 km wide to \u00011 km\nwide during its passage through the radar beam. The black\narc in event A never filled the radar beam completely, while\nthe arc in event B occupies the whole radar beam for at least\n10\u201315 s (see Figure 1).\n[10] By plotting the total light intensity within the radar\nbeam (so called in-beam luminosity) as function of time we\nsee in Figures 2 and 3 how the presence of the black arcs\nlowers the observed intensity. Note that the auroral imager\nis not calibrated, so the background level is not known in\nthe luminosity plots.\n[11] As can be seen from Figure 2, the black arc in event\nA reaches the radar beam at about 2004:10 UT. The black\narc passed rather quickly through the radar beam and the in-\nbeam luminosity was not greatly affected. In event B the\nthin black arc moved through the radar beam around\n2013:55 UT. A clear drop in in-beam luminosity is seen\nin Figure 3 for nearly 60 s. Both black arcs were observed\nfor about 2 minutes. During that time no signs of shear flow\nin the surrounding diffuse aurora were observed.\n[12] Figure 4 shows the 30 s integrated electron density\nmeasured by EISCAT. The noise level is clearly visible\nalthough the integration does increase the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) significantly. The median SNR is about 20, with\na standard deviation of about 15.\n4. Discussion\n[13] Auroral arcs are associated with a matched pair of\nFACs, the upward current centered above the arc while the\ndownward current is found either poleward or equatorward\nof it depending on the direction of the background convec-\ntion electric field. In the region of the downward current it is\ncommon to observe enhanced electric fields [Marklund et\nal., 1981; Bru\u00a8ning and Goertz, 1986] and low ionospheric\nplasma density, which is understood to be an effect of\ncurrent continuity through the arc boundary [Doe et al.,\n1995; Blixt and Brekke, 1996].\n[14] The same effect should be present in black aurora if\nthey are associated with downward currents. We expect a\nlow plasma density within the black region because the\ndownward current is carried by upward moving thermal\nelectrons of ionospheric origin, while the closing horizontal\nPedersen current is carried by ions, leaving behind a\ndepleted region.\n[15] To study the loss process due to a downward current,\nwe start with the ion continuity equation, but neglect\nrecombination which only increases the loss. We adopt a\nsimplified \u2018\u2018box\u2019\u2019 like ionosphere of height h, which is\nhomogeneous in the direction parallel to the black arc (like\nthat shown in Figure 1).\n[16] To derive the relationship between the ionospheric\nplasma density and the FAC, one further assumes that the\nPedersen current is mainly carried by ions in the collision-\nally dominated ionosphere, and that the downward field-\naligned current is mainly carried by upward moving cold\nionospheric electrons. The detailed derivation was treated\nby Blixt and Brekke [1996] and is not repeated here. It\nyields:\n@\n@t\nn \u0003 jk\nhe\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere n is the average plasma density in the region of the\nionosphere carrying the closure current (\u0003E-region), e is the\nFigure 1.

By integrating\nequation (1) from when the depletive mechanism becomes\nactive (t0) to t1 = t0 + t (assuming the FAC to be constant)\nwe get\njk \u0003 n0het\nn1 \u0007 n0\nn0\n\u0001 \u0002\n: \u00f02\u00de\nThus, equation (2) estimates how large the current density\nmust be to yield a given density depletion ((n1 \u0007 n0)\/n0).\nEquation (2) cannot be used in the upward current region, as\nprecipitation causes considerable additional ionization.\n[17] For the effect of the depletive mechanism to be seen\nin noisy electron density data, the depletion must be greater\nthan the radar noise level given by the SNR, thus j(n1\u0007n0)\/\nn0j > 1\/SNR. By using this in equation (2) we get\njk\n\u0003\u0003 \u0003\u0003 > n0he\nt\n1\nSNR\n\u0001 \u0002\n: \u00f03\u00de\nTo estimate the time the depletive mechanism is active (t)\nwithin the diffuse aurora we must know if the downward\ncurrent of the black aurora moves with the ionospheric\nplasma (E\u0002B velocity corresponds to the motion of the\naurora), or if the current system moves relative to\nthe ionospheric plasma. In the first case, t corresponds to\nthe effective lifetime of the black aurora, while in the latter\ncase t can be approximated with the halfwidth of the black\narc divided by the relative motion of the black segment.\nAny relative motion requires a potential drop along the\nmagnetic field, and the lack of any optical signatures of\nvelocity shears indicates that the potential drop in this case\n(if any) is very small. The diffuse aurorae, which contain the\nblack patches, are large scale features. It is known that large\nscale electric fields map directly along the magnetic field\n[Lyons, 1980], while it is only within small scale auroral\narcs that we can expect a differential motion between the\naurora and the ionospheric plasma. We therefore argue that\nthe effective time of the mechanism is equal to the lifetime\nof the black patch. Black patches and arcs have much longer\nlifetimes than black vortex streets. Kimball and Hallinan\n[1998a] noticed that black patches generally survive the\ntime it takes to pass through the imager\u2019s field of view (5 to\n10 s) but also tracked individual patches for up to a minute\nin all-sky imager data. As noted by Davis [1978] black\npatches can not be observed more than 30\u0002 off-zenith,\nwhich limits their observing duration. In contrast, the black\naurora observed here move slowly and last up to 120 s, so it\nis realistic to assume a lifetime of about 30 to 90 s.\n[18] We expect the depletion to be most effective in the\nE-region where the conductivity peaks (or more exactly, the\nregion where the electron density is enhanced, which is\nwhere perpendicular currents will close in the ionosphere).\nAs seen from Figure 4 this approximately corresponds to the\n106 to 166 km altitude region (h = 60 km). The height\naveraged electron density of this altitude region is shown in\nFigure 5 for 30 s integrated data (solid line) and 15 s\nintegrated data (dotted line). The electron density is around\nn \u0003 8 \t 1010m\u00073 and the additional height averaging over\n7 radar range gates further improves the electron density\nSNR, increasing it from 20 to around 50 in the 30 s\nintegrated data.\n[19] By inserting the above values into equation (3) we\nobtain the results shown in Figure 6. It is evident that for a\nblack auroral life time of 60 s (which is likely), and for\nSNR \u0003 50, the current needs to be stronger than 0.3 mA\/m2\nfor it to yield a density depletion deep enough to be seen\nthrough the noise in the radar data. We have chosen to use\nthe SNR level from the 30 s integrated EISCAT data\nbecause, as discussed in more detail below, the time\nresolution of that experiment is sufficient in resolving the\nblack auroral passage in event B.\n[20] Marklund et al. [2001] observed currents in the\nrange of 0.1\u20130.2 mA\/m2 in the downward FAC adjacent\nto auroral arcs with the Cluster satellites. This corresponds\nto 10\u201320 mA\/m2 at ionospheric altitudes, but at a horizontal\nscale an order of magnitude larger than the black aurora.\nKosch et al. [2000] observed downward current densities of\n\u00011 mA\/m2 adjacent to an auroral arc. While a typical\nstrength for upward currents associated with individual\nauroral arcs is around 1\u201310\u2019s mA\/m2, recent studies indicate\nthat the current strength is roughly inversely proportional to\nscale size [Stasiewicz and Potemra, 1998], and currents up\nto several 100\u2019s (even 1000) mA\/m2 have routinely been\nobserved [Stasiewicz and Potemra, 1998; Neubert and\nChristiansen, 2003] on sub-kilometer scales onboard low-\naltitude satellites. Marklund and Karlsson [2001] argue that\nthe current can be as strong as 30 mA\/m2 within a black\naurora. Our observations and estimates of the FAC strength\nmakes it likely that if black aurora were associated with a\nFAC, the depletive effect would be seen in our data.\n[21] As can be seen in Figure 5 there are several occa-\nsions when the plasma density exhibits a minor decrease.\nThe largest decrease occurs right after event A (about\n1 minute later), and there is also a smaller one after event\nFigure 5. Average electron density variation with time.\nThe solid line shows the 30 s integrated data while the\ndotted lined shows the 15 s integrated data. The average is\ntaken from 106 to 166 km altitude and the vertical lines\nshow events A and B.\nFigure 6. The time a downward current density, for a\ngiven SNR, can be active before it yields a density depletion\nlarge enough to be detected above the radar noise.\nL06813 BLIXT AND KOSCH: BLACK AURORA L06813\n3 of 4\nB, but it is clear that the direct passage of the black arcs\ndoes not alter the electron density significantly. One possi-\nble cause for this could be that the black arc only partially\nfills the radar beam, so that the whole volume covered by\nthe radar beam is not depleted by the same amount. We can\ntake this into account by assuming the worst case scenario.\nThe passage of the black arc in event B takes nearly two full\nradar integration periods (60 s). As the black arc has about\nthe same width as the radar beam, we can assume that it\nonly fills half the radar beam for two consecutive radar\nintegration periods.\n[22] Another possibility is that the black arc is associ-\nated with a very weak current, or no current at all. Event\nA is probably too short lived (the black arc passes through\nthe radar beam in less than 30 s) to give an observable\neffect. However, for event B, if we take into account the\nfactor of two in the worst case scenario, we find that the\ncurrent must be less than 0.6 mA\/m2. We note that this is\nan overestimate, since the assumed black aurora lifetime of\n60 s is relatively short compared to the observed lifetime\nup to 120 s. Since currents at small spatial scales, like that\nof the black aurora, are found to be much stronger than\nlarge scale currents, it is very likely that the black patches\npresented in this paper were not associated with any\nsignificant downward FAC.\n[23] Marklund et al. [2001] showed that the downward\ncurrent region is characterized by intense diverging electric\nfield structures at the typical altitudes of the Freja satellite,\nand Marklund et al. [1997] associated these downward\ncurrents with black aurora. It is well established that the\nsheared motions (and curls) found in auroral arcs are due to\nconverging electric fields. The lack of any shear motion in\nthe diffuse aurora surrounding the black aurora presented\nhere is because they are not associated with any intense\ndiverging electric field. We interpret this as another indica-\ntor that the black arcs are not associated with any downward\ncurrent.\n5. Conclusion\n[24] Results from the first coordinated optical and inco-\nherent scatter radar campaign for observations of black\naurora are presented.\n[25] We show that the presence of a downward field-\naligned current would give rise to a decrease in the iono-\nspheric electron density, and if the current strength is over a\ncertain threshold (depending on the signal-to-noise ratio in\nthe electron density data) the decrease would be measurable\nby the EISCAT radar. Black aurora are often claimed to be\nassociated with a downward FAC, and would in this case,\nby the argument above, be associated with a plasma density\ndecrease.\n[26] Observations of two black arcs that drift through the\nradar beam are discussed. The first passage is short lived,\nwhile the second passage lasts for about a minute. No\nevidence of an electron density decrease during the black\narc passages was seen in the EISCAT measurements.\n[27] We show that if a downward FAC exists within these\nblack aurora, it must be less than \u00010.6 mA\/m2. Based on the\nfact that small scale currents are generally stronger than\nlarge scale currents (10\u2013100\u2019s of mA\/m2 as compared to\n<1 mA\/m2 for large scale currents), and that the black arcs\nare not sheared and thus not associated with intense diverg-\ning electric fields, we conclude that the black arcs presented\nhere are not associated with any significant downward field-\naligned current.\n[28] Acknowledgments.
