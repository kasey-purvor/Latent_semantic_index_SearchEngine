We report the findings of\na project that involved the design, testing and evaluation of a set of computer-based tutorials\nemploying multiple-choice questions with 700 students on postgraduate and undergraduate\nintroductory Marketing modules. The computer-based tutorials were designed to meet two main\nobjectives, namely to help students in their formative assessment and to help staff monitor any\ndifficulties students were experiencing with module content. However, students incorporated the\ntutorials into their learning in ways that had not been anticipated specifically; they used the\ntutorials for a number of related but different purposes, and their usage patterns varied\nconsiderably.\nIntroduction\nThe importance of feedback in the learning process is self-evident and well documented\n(Rowntree, 1987; Brown & Knight, 1994). Students tend to place high value on the\nfeedback they obtain from teaching staff through the assessment process. Assessment can\nconsume as many staff hours as teaching (Gibbs & Jenkins, 1992). With increasing class\nsizes, teaching staff are encouraged to find ways to reduce the demands the assessment\nprocess places on their time. Peer and computer-marked assignments can help in this\nrespect.\nOur aim was to develop a Computer-Based Tutorial (CBT) that would provide students\nwith early and frequent opportunities to assess their own progress. The CBT contains\neleven separate tutorials corresponding to the main topic areas covered on the\nIntroduction to Marketing module. When students select a tutorial, they are presented,\nwith twenty-five multiple-choice questions (MCQs) selected at random from a bank of\nover fifty. Students have two chances to answer each question, and if they still answer\nincorrectly they are told the correct answer and directed to the appropriate page in the\ntext (see Figure 1). On completion of the tutorial, students are given their score and taken\n86\nAITJ Volume 3 Number I\nIf Uonfiir, a hairdryer Manufacturer\u00ab is focusing on custoner\nsatisfaction, it uill find that what corauners really want i\nFigure \/: Typical MCQ from the test bank\nback to the main menu where another choice can be made. Students are able to access the\nCBT on campus machines or, if they have a machine at work or at home, a take-away\nversion is available on floppy disk.\nA pre-pilot study with fifty-seven students during the 1993 summer semester revealed that\nstudents were using the CBT more frequently and for longer periods of time than was\nanticipated. Their recommendations for improving it suggested they were using it for\nreasons other than self-assessment.\nThe main pilot was undertaken during the winter and spring semesters of 1993-94, during\nwhich time over 700 students had been given access to the CBT. Log files were used to\ncapture data on the frequency and patterns of CBT usage on both on- and off-campus\nmachines. Feedback from a sample of student users was obtained by structured\nquestionnaire, unstructured interviews with individual students, projective techniques and\ndirect observation. The main pilot confirmed earlier findings, and these are reported in\ndetail elsewhere (Catterall & Ibbotson, 1994). In the remainder of this paper, we discuss\nthe findings of both the pre- and main pilot studies, and present our understanding of\nhow and why the CBT is incorporated into the student learning process.\nMain findings\nPart-time students are the heaviest users\nPart-time students were more likely to use the CBT, use it more frequently and for longer\nperiods of time. For example, single sessions of up to one hour were not uncommon\namong part-time students.\n87\nMiriam Caaerall and Patrick Ibbotson The use of computers as substitute tutors\nOne of the reasons for this difference was the availability of the CBT on a take-away disk\nfor use with off-campus computers, at home or at work. While under 10% of full-time\nstudents obtained take-away disks, over 60% of part-time students did so. However, part-\ntime students without access to off-campus machines were more likely to use the CBT\nthan their full-time counterparts, even though they are on campus for considerably fewer\nhours per week.\nUse decreases over time\nUse of the CBT decreased over time among all groups of students including part-timers\nand those with access to off-campus machines. To illustrate: 74% of a group of full-time\nundergraduates used the CBT regularly over the first half of the semester; during the\nsecond half, only 32% were still regular users.\nThere are a number of possible explanations for this finding:\nMCQ Assessment. Half of the groups or classes who participated in the pilot study were\ngiven an MCQ test (pen and paper) as one of their coursework assignments. This MCQ\ntest was administered at the halfway point in the semester. It is reasonable to assume that\na number of CBT users were practising for this test, and on its completion would no\nlonger feel the need to use the CBT. However, since CBT usage decreased also in groups\nthat were not assessed by MCQ test, this is not a complete explanation.\nNovelty. Very few students who participated in the pilot had any previous experience of\nthis type of computer-based learning. It could be hypothesized that a new and different\nlearning resource will hold some novelty value for students that will wear thin after a few\nuse-experiences. Evidence to support or reject this is not immediately apparent.\nWe did find some evidence that newer learners were more likely to perceive the CBT as a\nuseful learning resource than more experienced learners.\nFull-time postgraduate groups (experienced learners) were the least likely to use the CBT.\nA number of students in these groups reported that 'real' study involves texts and journal\narticles, and that in their perception CBTs are of marginal value. By contrast, students\nnew to the university environment (first-year undergraduates) and those returning after a\nbreak from formal education (part-time postgraduates) were more likely to use the CBT\nand look upon it as part of the total package of learning resources. One group of part-\ntime undergraduates who studied Marketing as their first module assumed that other\nmodules would also be offering CBTs as part of the learning resources, and were\nsurprised and disappointed to find this would not be the case.\nThe need for support reduces? On the basis of the evidence we have on how students use\nthe CBT and the reasons why they use it, it appears reasonable to conclude that the need\nfor the type of learning support provided by the CBT will decrease over time.\nStudents used the CBT in a variety of ways and for,\/different reasons, including:\nPreparation for learning. This involves working through a tutorial as quickly as possible\n(any answer will do) to identify the subject matter of the questions and the concepts or\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\nlearning points that are questioned most frequently. This gives the student clues as to\nwhich concepts or issues are most important and where effort needs to be concentrated.\nThis is likely to be more important for students in the early weeks of a new module\nwhen every bit of information seems vital. As the weeks progress, they may be better\nable to differentiate between key learning points and interesting information during\nlectures.\nConfidence building. The student has not read the lecture notes or the text, and works\nthrough the CBT trying to answer the questions correctly. Good luck or common sense\nwill ensure that they get some answers correct. Students report that this gives them a sense\nof achievement and confidence. In other words, they already know something about this\nsubject even before they begin to study it. They report that this makes the study of text\nand notes a less daunting prospect. This is also likely to be more important to the student\nduring the first weeks of a new module. As they learn more about the subject and become\nfamiliar with the text, they may need this type of CBT support less frequently, if at all.\nStudying. The student has not studied the lecture notes or the text, though he\/she may\nhave read them through once or twice. The student works through the CBT with the\nnotes and text to hand, answering the questions and checking the appropriate reference in\nthe textbook. As the weeks progress, and the student becomes more familiar with the\nmaterial, the need for this type of support should diminish. This type of studying\nappeared to be very time-consuming though many students continued to use it\nthroughout the semester. When asked why, the most frequent responses were that they\npreferred to learn this way and it helped them concentrate.\nSelf assessment. After having studied the material, students use the CBT to assess their\nlearning. When asked about the benefits of this approach, they reported that it gave them\na sense of achievement and confidence. Part-time students reported that it was important\nto feel they had achieved something early on in the module. In other words, in the first\nfew weeks they were uncertain as to whether they had made the right decision in returning\nto study: would they be able to study, were they studying enough or too little? The early\nfeedback from the CBT provided reassurance in these respects. Again, it could be argued\nthat as students' confidence increases, the need for this kind of CBT support reduces.\nDrawbacks with heavy CBT usage\nThe design of the CBT was based on the following assumptions:\n\u2022 a typical CBT session would involve the student using a single tutorial; and\n\u2022 a single tutorial would typically take up to fifteen minutes to complete.\nThe data reveals that there is no typical session or typical session-length. Some students\nwould use five or more different tutorials or the same tutorial five or more times in a\nsession. Very few users would undertake only one tutorial in a session. Tutorial times\nvaried in length between four minutes (presumably for preparation for learning) to forty\nminutes or more (probably using with a textbook).\n89\nMiriam Catlerall and Patrick Ibbotson The use of computers as substitute tutors\nGiven the long duration of many individual sessions, it is not surprising that a number of\nstudents reported suffering from eye strain. It emerged also that question design can\ncontribute to this; specifically, questions where the answer options were long and wordy\ndid not work well. Ideally, when designing MCQs for the screen, the answer options need\nto be short and sharp.\nA number of students reported that the CBT was easy and fun in the beginning but\nbecame monotonous and boring in later weeks. This is understandable, given the very\nheavy use made of the CBT by these students in the first half of the semester.\nWe have addressed this issue in two ways:\nMore variety in question design. The MCQ format is flexible and offers many advantages\nover other question types (Ebel & Frisbie, 1986). The addition of graphics to illustrate\nquestions should be an improvement on the current all-text format. The number of\nanswer options is now more varied, ranging from two to five, when previously all\nquestions had five options. The design of open questions will reduce the monotony of\nsimply using the mouse to point to and select the chosen response.\nProgression. One of our original design specifications was that progression should be built\ninto the CBT. Specifically, later tutorials should contain more difficult questions than\nearlier tutorials, and later tutorials should build on knowledge and comprehension of\nearlier tutorial material. Earlier tutorials do contain a higher proportion of easy questions,\nand this was identified by students. The proportion of difficult questions in later tutorials\nhas been increased. Designing MCQs is acknowledged to be a time-consuming and\ndifficult task (Osterlind, 1989). Designing MCQs sufficiently short and sharp for the screen\nthat also build on earlier tutorial material is proving difficult to realize.\nConclusions\nThe most disturbing finding from the pilot study was that the number of users of the CBT\nand their frequency of use decreased over time. Further, some of the disadvantages\nidentified by students give cause for concern; notably that it becomes boring and causes\neye strain. However, it would be inappropriate to take these findings at face value and\nconclude that the CBT has failed to engage students sufficiently.\nThe CBT was created with the overall aim of providing students with early and frequent\nopportunities to assess their progress on the Marketing module. In the event, self-\nassessment was only one of the reasons why students used the CBT. Students were as\nlikely to use the CBT to help prepare them for learning and to build confidence as to self-\nassess what and how much learning had been achieved.\nIn this respect, the CBT proved especially useful for part-time students who needed the\nreassurance in the first few weeks of the module that, under ideal circumstances, a human\ntutor would be able to provide on a one-to-one basis. As students gain confidence and\nfamiliarity with the subject matter and their study of it, the need for the kind of support\nthe CBT provided will reduce.\n90\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nThe disadvantages identified by students need to be addressed. For example, if some\nstudents are experiencing eye strain from sitting for long periods in front of the screen,\ninstructing them not to do so is unlikely to solve the problem. Similarly, if students get\nbored because they use the CBT far more frequently than was ever intended, telling them\nto use it less frequently is not a helpful response. To this end, we have attempted to\nintroduce more variety into the question format, reduced the amount of text that appears\non screen and made tutorials progressively more challenging.\nThe pilot study revealed the likely demand among students for computer-based learning\nresources that can be used off the campus. The majority of part-time students have access\nto off-campus machines. There are a number of advantages in encouraging students to\nuse CBT off-campus material, not least of which is that it reduces the demand for on-\ncampus machines to the benefit of students without off-campus access.\nMarketers employ research to identify how consumers perceive and relate to products,\nsince consumers will identify new uses and benefits not envisaged by manufacturers. Our\npilot study illustrates this applies equally to CBT development.\nReferences\nBrown, S. and Knight, P.
