Images of mesospheric airglow and radar-wind\nmeasurements have been combined to estimate the difference\nin the vertical flux of horizontal momentum carried by high-\nfrequency gravity waves over two dissimilar Antarctic sta-\ntions. Rothera (67\u25e6 S, 68\u25e6 W) is situated in the mountains\nof the Peninsula near the edge of the wintertime polar vor-\ntex. In contrast, Halley (76\u25e6 S, 27\u25e6 W), some 1658 km to\nthe southeast, is located on an ice sheet at the edge of the\nAntarctic Plateau and deep within the polar vortex during\nwinter. The cross-correlation coefficients between the ver-\ntical and horizontal wind perturbations were calculated from\nsodium (Na) airglow imager data collected during the aus-\ntral winter seasons of 2002 and 2003 at Rothera for com-\nparison with the 2000 and 2001 results from Halley reported\npreviously (Espy et al., 2004). These cross-correlation coef-\nficients were combined with wind-velocity variances from\ncoincident radar measurements to estimate the daily aver-\naged upper-limit of the vertical flux of horizontal momentum\ndue to gravity waves near the peak emission altitude of the\nNa nightglow layer, 90 km. The resulting momentum flux\nat both stations displayed a large day-to-day variability and\nshowed a marked seasonal rotation from the northwest to the\nsouthwest throughout the winter. However, the magnitude\nof the flux at Rothera was about 4 times larger than that at\nHalley, suggesting that the differences in the gravity-wave\nsource functions and filtering by the underlying winds at the\ntwo stations create significant regional differences in wave\nforcing on the scale of the station separation.\nKeywords. Meteorology and atmospheric dynamics (Gen-\neral circulation; Middle atmosphere dynamics; Waves and\ntides)\n1 Introduction\nAtmospheric gravity waves, with spatial scales of ten to a few\nhundred kilometers and temporal scales between five min-\nutes and several hours, are typically generated in the lower\nCorrespondence to: P. J. Espy\n(pje@bas.ac.uk)\natmosphere through the action of weather systems or oro-\ngraphic lifting of air masses (Fritts and Alexander, 2003, and\nreferences therein). These waves grow in amplitude as they\npropagate into the rarified mesosphere, where some break\nand dissipate their energy and momentum locally. Depend-\ning upon the filtering action of the winds below, this input of\nmomentum closes the mesospheric jets, limiting wind speeds\nand driving the mesopause winds and temperatures far from\nradiative equilibrium (Haurwitz, 1961; Garcia and Solomon,\n1985; Lu\u00a8bken et al., 1990; Fritts and Luo, 1995; Luo et al.,\n1995; Espy and Stegman, 2002; Fritts and Alexander, 2003).\nGiven the role of gravity waves in determining global cir-\nculation and thermal balance, they are an essential element\nof global circulation models (GCMs). However, most of the\ngravity-wave spectrum that is important for maintaining the\nmean circulation is not explicitly resolvable in current GCMs\n(Vincent, 1984), and consequently, the effects of these waves\nmust be parameterized a priori (Hamilton, 1996). More im-\nportantly, GCMs require spatial and temporal variations in\nthe gravity-wave parameterization in order to reproduce the\nwave-driven circulation effects (e.g. Rind et al., 1988; Hamil-\nton, 1995), particularly in the Antarctic where these varia-\ntions are critical for GCM performance but where measure-\nments are scarce (Garcia and Boville, 1994; Hamilton, 1996).\nHence, knowledge of the seasonal and latitudinal behaviour\nof the gravity-wave momentum flux is essential to both guide\nand constrain these parameterizations.\nIn this paper, we present optical-imaging Na airglow mea-\nsurements that provide an independent measure of the cross-\ncorrelation between the vertical and horizontal wind pertur-\nbations caused by gravity waves in the mesosphere. Combin-\ning these with wind-velocity variances from coincident radar\nmeasurements, the daily averaged upper-limit of the verti-\ncal flux of horizontal momentum due to gravity waves may\nbe inferred. The measurements were undertaken at Rothera\nfor comparison with the climatology of momentum flux re-\nported from Halley (Espy et al., 2004). The two Antarctic\nstations are separated by 8\u25e6 of latitude, and each is subject\nto extremely different wind regimes and orography. Halley\nis located on the Brunt Ice Shelf at the edge of the Antarctic\nplateau and separated from the Trans-Antarctic Mountains\n82 P. J.

In addition, at 76\u25e6 S, it is located deep\nwithin the polar vortex during winter. In contrast, Rothera\nis situated within in the mountains of the Antarctic Penin-\nsula, and at 67\u25e6 S sits near the edge of the strong winter-\ntime polar vortex winds. Thus, the two stations are likely to\nhave differences in their gravity-wave fields. For example,\nErn et al. (2004), using \u223c2 weeks of satellite temperature\ndata, observed high values of gravity-wave momentum flux\nat 25 km at the point where the Peninsula meets the edge of\nthe Antarctic polar vortex near Rothera due to a localized\nregion of short horizontal wavelength gravity waves. This\npresent study provides an extensive, climatological charac-\nterization of the mesospheric gravity-wave fields at two dis-\ntinct stations that show not only the seasonal and day-to-\nday variation of gravity-wave momentum flux in the critical\nAntarctic region, but also the regional variations in that flux\nindicative of differences in wave forcing on the scale of the\nstation separation, 1658 km.\n2 Instrumentation and observations\nThe sodium (Na) airglow, which originates from a thin\n(\u223c8 km thick) layer centred near 90 km, is modulated as at-\nmospheric wave-induced density and temperature perturba-\ntions move through the layer (Swenson and Gardner, 1998).\nAs part of a collaboration between Utah State University\n(USU) and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), observations\nof the gravity-wave induced intensity fluctuations of Na night\nairglow in two-dimensions were made using a monochro-\nmatic imaging system developed by USU. The camera used\nin this investigation, which has been described in detail else-\nwhere (Espy et al., 2004), consisted of a cooled (\u201345\u25e6C),\nbare, 512\u00d7512 (effective) charge coupled device (CCD) ar-\nray. This was coupled to a fast, f \/4, telecentric lens system\nto produce an all-sky image. Although a filter wheel was\nused to observe several airglow emissions, only the Na was\nused to calculate the momentum flux as it was the least sus-\nceptible to auroral contamination.

Each\nimage was then integrated on the CCD for 90 s before being\ndigitized to 16 bits, and the images were acquired at \u223c6 min\nintervals.\nSodium images could be acquired whenever the sun had\nset 14\u25e6 or more below the horizon. In addition, the imager\ncould tolerate a partial moon (\u223c40% disk) at elevations as\nhigh as 5\u25e6 before the CCD saturation spread and contam-\ninated other pixels. Automated software was used so that\nimages were acquired only under these conditions. With the\nhigh sensitivity of the camera system, gravity-wave pertur-\nbations of the Na airglow intensity of a few percent were\nreadily observed. Waves observed by the imager are char-\nacterized by vertical wavelengths greater than 12 km, short\nhorizontal wavelengths (\u03bb<150 km) and large phase speeds\n(CI>40 m\/s) (Swenson and Gardner, 1998). An example all-\nsky Na image is shown in Fig. 1, where the north-to-south\noriented gravity-wave structure is apparent.\nNightly sequences of these Na images were used to cal-\nculate the normalized momentum flux using the technique of\nGardner et al. (1999), which is described in the next section.\nTo estimate the daily averaged upper-limit of the vertical flux\nof horizontal momentum due to gravity waves, these normal-\nized values were multiplied by the RMS wind perturbation\ndue to the gravity waves. At Rothera, this was determined\nusing coincident MF radar wind measurements and calculat-\ning the velocity variance over the same period to estimate the\ngravity-wave wind fluctuations (Meek et al., 1985).\nThe Rothera MF radar (Jarvis et al., 1999) is a coherent\nspaced-sensor radar system used for measuring horizontal\nwinds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere through\nthe observation and analysis of D-region partial reflection\nechoes. The radar employs a single broad-beam transmit\nantenna that illuminates an area commensurate with the all-\nsky imager field-of-view used in the analysis (Greet et al.,\nP. J. Espy et al.: Regional variations of mesospheric gravity-wave momentum flux 83\n2000), and three spaced receive antennas in a triangular ar-\nray. The radar operates at a frequency of 1.98 MHz, with a\npeak transmitter power of 25 kW and full width half maxi-\nmum pulse width of 25\u00b5s. This corresponds to a height res-\nolution of \u223c4 km sampled at 2-km height intervals between\n50 and 100 km, with the majority of echoes returned from\naltitudes between 75 and 95 km. The received echoes are an-\nalyzed using the full-correlation analysis technique (Briggs,\n1984) from which profiles of the zonal and meridional com-\nponents of the horizontal wind are derived every two minutes\n(Vincent and Lesicar, 1991; Holdsworth et al., 1995).\nThe optical and radar observations were carried out during\nthe austral winter seasons of 2002 and 2003 at Rothera for\ncomparison with the results from the winter seasons of 2000\nand 2001 at Halley (Espy et al., 2004). Despite the high ge-\nographic latitude of the stations, they are situated at lower\ngeomagnetic latitude (L=2.7 and 4.5 for Rothera and Halley,\nrespectively) than their northern latitude counterparts. Nev-\nertheless, aurora could occasionally severely contaminate the\nimages. Thus, the data for each night were screened for\nboth auroral and meteorological cloud contamination using\nother, broadband spectral channels. For each night, a sin-\ngle contiguous image sequence that was free of aurora and\ncloud was selected for further analysis. The sequence length\nvaried throughout the season from a maximum near solstice\nof 14.4 h to a minimum of 1.2 h near the equinoxes. In to-\ntal, 49 days in 2002 and 28 days in 2003 were analysed at\nRothera, in comparison to the 40 days in 2000 and 39 days in\n2001 that had been used for Halley. Figure 2 gives the annual\nsampling distribution of usable imager observations in hours\nfrom Rothera. The MF-radar derived RMS wind at 90 km,\nthe nominal peak of the nighttime Na emission, was derived\nthroughout the portion of the night during which airglow ob-\nservations were available. The radar winds were available\nfor all but 6 nights during 2002 at Rothera, in comparison to\n4 missing nights of wind data in each of the two seasons at\nHalley.\n3 Analysis\nIn this study, the measured azimuthal distribution of the rel-\native airglow intensity variance is used as a proxy for the az-\nimuthal distribution of the horizontal velocity variance in a\ngravity-wave model to predict the momentum flux as a func-\ntion of azimuth angle. The technique for estimating momen-\ntum fluxes using airglow imager data in this way has been\ndescribed fully by Gardner et al. (1999), and can be used to\nestimate the momentum fluxes associated with the full spec-\ntrum of both monochromatic as well as quasi-random wave\nperturbations. The technique has been validated against Na\nwind lidar measurements of momentum flux when applied to\nboth monochromatic waves (Swenson et al., 1999) and the\nfull wave spectrum (Gardner et al., 1999), and has been used\nto infer the seasonal variation of the momentum flux in the\nNorthern and Southern Hemispheres (Tang et al. 2002; Espy\net al., 2004)\nBriefly, the 3-D Fourier spectrum in frequency, \u03c9, and\nthe zonal, k, and meridional, l, horizontal wave numbers,\nwas computed for the nightly sequence of all-sky Na im-\nages using the processing techniques detailed in Gardner et\nal. (1996) and Coble et al. (1998). The unambiguous 2-D\nhorizontal wavenumber spectrum, describing the distribution\nof gravity-wave energy as a function of horizontal scale and\npropagation direction, was computed by integrating over fre-\nquency. This included the effects of waves with observed\nperiods between 12 min (the temporal Nyquist limit) and\n2 h, and horizontal wavelengths between 2.4 km (the spatial\nNyquist limit) and 150 km. The unambiguous 2-D spectrum\nwas then integrated over this wavenumber range to create an\nangular spectrum representing the azimuthal distribution of\nrelative Na intensity variance.\nGardner et. al. (1999) has shown that the cross-correlation\ncoefficients between the vertical and horizontal winds, which\nare the momentum fluxes normalized by the respective RMS\nwind perturbations, can be expressed as a simple integral\nover this azimuthal distribution of intensity variance as:\u2329\nw\u2032\n(\nu\u2032\nv\u2032\n)\u232a\nw\u2032rms\n(\nu\u2032rms\nv\u2032rms\n) =\nG \u00b7\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c6\n\u2329\nI \u2032Na(\u03c6)2\n\u232a\nI\u00af 2Na\n(\nsin (\u03c6)\ncos (\u03c6)\n)\n[\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c6\n\u2329\nI \u2032Na(\u03c6)2\n\u232a\nI\u00af 2Na\n\u00b7\n2pi\u222b\n0\nd\u03c6\n\u2329\nI \u2032Na(\u03c6)2\n\u232a\nI\u00af 2Na\n(\nsin2 (\u03c6)\ncos2 (\u03c6)\n)] , (1)\nwhere w\u2032rms , u\u2032rmsand v\u2032rms are the RMS values of verti-\ncal and horizontal zonal and meridional wind perturbations,\nwhile I\u00afNa and I \u2032Na are the mean value and relative pertur-\nbation of the Na emission intensity caused by gravity waves\nmoving in the azimuthal direction, \u03c6. The vertical flux of\nhorizontal momentum is directly proportional to these cor-\nrelation coefficients scaled by the standard deviations of the\nhorizontal and vertical winds derived from the radar data.\nThe above relations and the factor, G, which sets the\nrange of the cross-correlations coefficients, were developed\nusing the gravity wave polarization relations and employing a\ncanonical power-law model for the frequency distribution of\nhorizontal velocity variance. As a model frequency spectrum\n(spectral slope =2) is integrated from the inertial to the Brunt\nfrequency, it is not necessary to compensate for the Doppler\neffects associated with the mean background wind. For the\nexact form of G and uncertainties of the zonal and merid-\nional cross-correlation coefficients, the reader is referred to\nGardner et al. (1999). As the method assumes that all waves\npropagate upwards and are not ducted, it provides an up-\nper limit to the momentum flux (Fritts, 2000). However,\nthis does not appear to be a serious shortcoming. By ad-\njusting the integration limits, Tang et al. (2002) showed that\nthe ducted waves, typically with horizontal wavelengths less\nthan 20 km (Fritts and Alexander, 2003), contribute less than\n10% to the momentum fluxes inferred using this method,\n84 P. J. Espy et al.: Regional variations of mesospheric gravity-wave momentum flux\nFig. 3. The unambiguous 2-D horizontal wavenumber spectrum, (a), and the angular spectrum, (b), for the sequence of images acquired\nduring the night of 28\/29 July 2002 from Rothera. The scales for both spectra are logarithmic, and the 2-D spectrum is in units of (relative\n% wave amplitude\/ wavenumber)2, whilst the angular spectrum has units of (relative % wave amplitude)2\/radian. For comparison, the\nwavenumber spectrum, (c), and the angular spectrum, (d), for the same night during 2001 at Halley are shown.\nand those results have been confirmed in the present anal-\nysis. In addition, Gardner et. al. (1999) successfully vali-\ndated the momentum fluxes derived using this imager-spectra\ntechnique against those measured directly by a dual-beam Na\nwind lidar. Due to the extended gravity-wave spectrum ob-\nserved, Swenson et al. (1999) found that the magnitudes of\nthe imager-spectra and Na-lidar momentum fluxes reported\nby Gardner et al. (1999) were larger than those derived from\nimaging specific monochromatic waves or the climatologi-\ncal values derived from radars (Vincent, 1984). Thus, only\nmomentum-flux magnitudes derived using this same imager-\nspectra technique described by Gardner et. al. (1999) will be\ncompared here.\nTo employ this procedure, the true zenith pixel and north-\nward direction were determined using star positions. The\nimages were then re-centred on this position and rotated so\nas to align the cardinal directions along the Cartesian axis.\nNext, the images were flat-fielded to remove the van Rhijn\neffect and to correct for the variations in the response of\nthe fish-eye lens and CCD (Coble et al., 1998). Finally,\nthe stellar contamination was removed using the gradient-\nbased edge technique described by Tang et al. (2003). To\navoid the severe distortions and loss of spatial resolution in-\ntroduced by the fish-eye lens, only the centre 150-by-150 km\nfield-of-view was interpolated to a 256 square grid on geo-\ngraphic co-ordinates. The unambiguous 2-D Fourier spec-\ntrum of the airglow perturbations was then calculated for\neach night using the sequence of these re-sampled images\n(Gardner et al., 1996; Coble et al., 1998; Tang et al., 2002).\nThe angular spectrum, which gives the distribution of wave\nenergy as a function of propagation direction, was calcu-\nlated for each night by integrating the resulting unambigu-\nous Fourier spectrum radially over horizontal wave numbers\nfrom 2pi \/(150 km) to 2pi \/(2.4 km), the maximum field and\nspatial Nyquist limit, respectively.\nAs an example, the unambiguous 2-D horizontal\nwavenumber spectrum and the angular spectrum for the night\nof 28\/29 July 2002 from Rothera is shown in Figs. 3a and b.\nFor comparison, the same day in 2001 from Halley is shown\nin Figs. 3c and d. The 2-D spectra show extensive wave\namplitudes at both Rothera and Halley. However, the grav-\nity wave amplitudes at Rothera are predominantly in the\nP. J.

The direction of the\nwave field is more clearly indicated by the angular spectra\nof Figs. 3b and d. Qualitatively, more gravity-wave ampli-\ntude is seen in the westward propagating direction than the\neastward at Rothera, which suggests a large zonal momen-\ntum flux there. Also, the gravity-wave amplitudes at Halley\nare more nearly balanced in the eastward and westward di-\nrections, implying a smaller net zonal momentum flux there.\nUsing this angular spectrum, the relative Na intensity vari-\nance was then determined as a function of azimuth angle for\nuse as a proxy for the horizontal velocity variance in the ex-\npressions for the cross-correlation coefficients between the\nhorizontal and vertical winds (Coble et al., 1998; Gardner et.\nal., 1999). The radar winds over the Na airglow layer alti-\ntude, 90 km, were binned into half-hourly medians, and the\nmean and tidal components fitted over sliding 3-day inter-\nvals were removed (Charles and Jones, 1999). The variance\nof the residuals was calculated over the same time period as\nthe imager data so as to capture the same frequency content,\nand this was used to represent the variance due to gravity\nwaves with periods between 4 min (the Nyquist period) and\nthe length of the data segment (Meek et al., 1985). Averag-\ning three adjacent range bins to approximate the response of\nthe thicker Na layer did not significantly affect the variance\ndetermination, but reduced the number of points available for\nthe tidal fit. As the effects were negligible, and in order to im-\nprove the quality of the tidal fits and more closely duplicate\nthe Halley analysis, only the 90 km range bin was used to de-\ntermine the wind variance. To estimate the errors associated\nwith these wind variances, this procedure was performed to\ncalculate daily variance values throughout the years of oper-\nation at each station. The variance levels were at their lowest\nduring the summer periods due to lower gravity-wave fluxes\n(Lu\u00a8bken et al., 1990), and the absolute minimum daily value\nwas taken to be a measure of the uncertainty in the vari-\nance for use in the error analysis. Although this estimate\nof uncertainty may contain residual geophysical variations,\nit represents an upper limit of the uncertainty in the calcu-\nlated wind variance. These wind variances were then used\nto scale the correlation coefficients so as to determine the\nnightly averaged vertical flux of horizontal momentum in the\nzonal and meridional directions, and the error estimates for\nthe variances and correlation coefficients propagated through\nthe calculation to provide an uncertainty estimate for the mo-\nmentum flux. For the nights where radar winds were not\navailable, the average yearly values of the wind variances\nwere used as scaling factors (Tang et al., 2002; Espy et al.,\n2004).\n4 Results\nThe results for the two seasons at Rothera are shown in\nFig. 4. Here we see that the momentum fluxes in both zonal\nand meridional directions show a great deal of day-to-day\nvariability, a feature noted in other seasonal studies, partic-\nularly at Halley (Murphy and Vincent, 1993; Swenson et.\nal., 1999; Tang et al., 2002; Espy et al., 2004). However,\ndespite the variability, there is a tendency for the large west-\nward (negative) zonal values to occur near winter solstice and\nto approach zero near the equinoxes. Those points for which\n86 P. J.

Also shown in (b) are\nthe monthly averages from Halley, on a vertical scale 5 times smaller than the Rothera results. The solid and dashed lines are weighted\nleast-squares fits to the zonal and meridional data, respectively.\nthe average values of the wind variances were used as scaling\nfactors, shown by the open data points, do not show a signif-\nicant trend, indicating that this approximation does not bias\nthe results. Also, the zonal fluxes appear to be generally in\nthe westward direction and much stronger than the northward\n(positive) tending meridional fluxes.\nThe individual nightly gravity-wave momentum-flux mea-\nsurements from the two years at Rothera were averaged\nto monthly means to examine the climatological seasonal\nbehaviour. The uncertainties in each nightly value were\nused to weight the values in the monthly average, which\nare shown along with their standard errors of the mean\nin Fig. 5a. For comparison, the Halley monthly averages\nfrom Espy et al. (2004), obtained using the same analy-\nsis technique, are reproduced in Fig. 5b. The momentum\nfluxes from both stations show a clear trend to shift from\nthe north and strongly westward at mid-winter towards the\nsouth and weakly westward near the equinoxes, consistent\nwith the filtering of gravity waves by the underlying wind\nfield (Espy et al., 2004). This behaviour is in agreement\nwith other southern-hemisphere seasonal observations (Mur-\nphy and Vincent, 1993) and with northern-hemisphere re-\nsults, although there the meridional trends are of course re-\nversed (Swenson et. al., 1999; Tang et al., 2002). Whilst\nboth Rothera and Halley display wintertime westward and\nnorthward flux, the magnitude of the monthly average flux\nat Rothera is \u223c4 times greater. The trend in both the sea-\nsonal variation and the difference between the Rothera and\nHalley momentum fluxes are observed in the raw correla-\ntion coefficients derived from the imager, which is common\nto the two sites. These variations and differences are then\namplified when the correlation coefficients are scaled by the\nwind variances to obtain the momentum flux. The two dif-\nferent radar techniques used to obtain these wind variances,\nMF at Rothera and IDI at Halley, have each been found to\ncompare favourably with meteor wind radars (Hocking and\nThayaparan, 1997; Thayaparan and Hocking, 2002; Jones\net al., 2003), indicating that the larger momentum fluxes at\nRothera are not the result of the different radar techniques. In\nfact, the tendency for MF radars to underestimate the winds\nabove 90 km (e.g. Hocking and Thayaparan, 1997; Thaya-\nparan and Hocking, 2002) would further increase the Rothera\nmomentum fluxes.\nAveraging the individual daily values shown in Fig. 4\nyields a mean flux at Rothera of \u201332 m2\u00b7s\u22122 and 4.0 m2\u00b7s\u22122\nin the zonal and meridional directions, respectively. As with\nthe monthly averages, this is significantly higher than the\nwintertime average flux observed using the same technique\nat Halley of \u20137.5 m2\u00b7s\u22122 in the zonal and 1.6 m2s\u22122 in the\nmeridional directions (Espy et al., 2004). However, the zonal\ndifference is much smaller when the Rothera flux is com-\npared to that observed at a similar mountainous site at 35\u25e6 N\nusing the same technique. There, Tang et al. (2002) ob-\nserved an average wintertime flux at 35\u25e6 N of \u201320 m2\u00b7s\u22122\nand \u201312 m2\u00b7s\u22122 in the zonal and meridional directions, re-\nspectively.\nOne possibility is that higher stratospheric winds may pro-\nduce more efficient filtering of the eastward gravity waves\nat the different sites, thus creating more asymmetry in the\nwave field and correspondingly greater westward momen-\ntum flux reaching the mesosphere. However, the Horizon-\ntal Wind Model (HWM-93) (Hedin et al., 1996) shows a\nP. J. Espy et al.: Regional variations of mesospheric gravity-wave momentum flux 87\nwintertime stratospheric zonal-wind maximum at Rothera\nof \u223c53 m\u00b7s\u22121, as compared to \u223c57 m\u00b7s\u22121 at 35\u25e6 N and\n\u223c40 m\u00b7s\u22121 at Halley. Thus, while decreased efficiency of\nthe stratospheric wind filtering may play some role in the\nlow zonal flux at Halley, it cannot explain the zonal flux at\nRothera being 50% larger than that at 35\u25e6 N. Similarly, the\nHWM-93 stratospheric meridional winds, which are similar\nat the three sites, cannot explain the differences observed in\nthe meridional-flux.\nA more likely explanation is that the gravity-wave source\nfunctions themselves differ at the three sites. While similar\nat the mountainous sites, Halley\u2019s flat topography, as well as\nits distance from the Trans-Antarctic Mountains, the storm\nsystems of the South Atlantic and the shear zones of the win-\ntertime polar vortex, all contribute to a smaller gravity-wave\nsource function there. This would account for the significant\nregional differences in the momentum flux between Rothera\nand Halley, and hence the wave forcing, on the scale of the\nstation separation.\n5 Conclusions\nShort-scale gravity waves play an essential role determin-\ning the global circulation and thermal balance. GCM pa-\nrameterizations of these waves must be both guided and con-\nstrained by measurements of critical parameters, such as the\ngravity-wave momentum flux, its seasonal change and its re-\ngional variation, particularly in the critical Antarctic regions.\nTo that end, we have used 77 nights, distributed over two\nyears, of Antarctic Na-airglow imaging observations and co-\nincident MF-radar winds from Rothera to derive the momen-\ntum flux using the 3-D spectral analysis technique of Gardner\net. al. (1999). The resulting seasonal momentum-flux clima-\ntology may then be directly compared to that reported from\nHalley using a similar technique (Espy et al., 2004) to ex-\namine regional variations indicative of differences in wave\nactivity on the scale of the station separation, 1658 km.\nThe results from Rothera show a great deal of day-to-day\nvariability in the derived momentum flux, but a distinct ten-\ndency for the mid-winter, strong westward momentum flux to\napproach zero near the equinoxes. Combining the data into\nmonthly averages, the seasonal variation showing the turning\nof the momentum flux from the north and strongly westward\ndirection at mid-winter towards the south and weakly west-\nward direction at the equinoxes is seen clearly. This seasonal\ntrend has been shown to be consistent with the stratospheric\nwinds preferentially removing gravity waves with their same\ndirections through critical-level filtering (Alexander, 1998;\nFritts and Alexander, 2003; Espy et al., 2004). Thus, the re-\nmaining gravity-wave field in the mesosphere is observed to\nrotate so as to track the summer pole (Tang et al., 2002).\nAlthough this rotation of the momentum flux is observed\nat both Rothera and Halley, the magnitude of the Rothera\nzonal flux climatology is \u223c4 times greater than that ob-\nserved at Halley. This is in agreement with the results of\nErn et al. (2004), who observed a similar spatial maximum\nof gravity-wave momentum flux near Rothera during a two-\nweek period. Similarly, the zonal fluxes at Rothera are\u223c50%\nlarger than those observed using the same technique at a\nnorthern mid-latitude site with similar orographic forcing.\nThese flux differences cannot be explained by variations in\nstratospheric wind filtering alone, indicating that the gravity-\nwave sources are systematically stronger at Rothera.\nIn summary, the observational results presented here show\nthat the seasonal variation of the horizontal momentum\ncarried upward through the Na airglow region by high-\nfrequency gravity waves is directed opposite to the strato-\nspheric wind direction. In both Antarctica and the north-\nern hemisphere, this results in wintertime fluxes that are\npredominantly zonal while the meridional fluxes display a\nmarked rotation towards the summer pole throughout the sea-\nson. In addition, Rothera, which is located on the moun-\ntainous Antarctic Peninsula, must also have stronger gravity-\nwave sources to account for its flux being approximately four\ntimes greater than that observed at Halley on the Brunt Ice\nShelf. Thus, differences over \u223c1700 km in both the gravity-\nwave source functions and possibly filtering by the underly-\ning winds can create significant regional differences in mo-\nmentum flux and consequent wave forcing over Antarctica\nthroughout the autumn through spring seasons.\nAcknowledgements.
