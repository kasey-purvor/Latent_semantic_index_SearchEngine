The development of\nInformation Communication Technologies (ICT) and the Internet in particular is changing\ncommunication between consumers and vendors dramatically. The Internet offers superior\nfacilities for relationship building compared to conventional means. Marketing is therefore\ncalled to capitalise on the emerging new tools and to enhance the relationship between\ncompanies and consumers towards adding value, improving service and ultimately\ncontributing to the profitability of enterprises. Thus reducing the data handling problems so\ncommon in marketing (Wang, Head and Archer 2000). Consumer Centric Marketing\n(CCM) is a relatively new trend in marketing. It aims to streamline data used by companies\nand to take Customer Relationship Marketing (CRM) one step forward.\nThe ultimate aim of CCM is for companies to gain insight into the general characteristics of\ntheir individual clients, by becoming experts in the customer motivations, habits, attitudes\nand values that shape the consumers\u2019 opinion about the brands the company is offering\n(Wright, Nancarrow and Michel, 2002). In addition, CCM provides the electronic tools to\nenable consumers to customise the product they purchase to their personal needs and\nrequirements. Customers take an active role in the design of their product by declaring their\npreferences and customising their product packages accordingly. Hence CCM elevates the\ncustomer-company relationship to its rightful position in the organisation. Such strategy\nalso forms the basis for differentiation and greater value creation leading to loyalty and\nprofitability and thus provides the organisation with long term return on their investment\n(Bolton, 2004; Mello, 2002; Wright, Stone and Abbott, 2002). Once the company embraces\n3customer centric marketing they are also implementing an integrated customer centred\nmanagement style (Sheth, Sisodia and Sharma, 2000; Paulin, Ferguson and Payaud, 2000).\nFurthermore, companies that aim to establish regular communication with their customers\nwill increasingly enjoy trust-based relationships (Lietz, 2003; Maney, Flink and Lietz,\n2002). As such CCM on its own has not created head waves in marketing; it is the\ncombination of CCM philosophy and technological advancements that allow for a more\nsophisticated data collection and manipulation as well as personalisation of products,\nservices and experiences that whets the appetite of even seasoned Marketing Managers.\nThe internet has changed the way goods and services are purchased. The web environment\nhas empowered the consumers on three levels, firstly, to make informed purchases as\nindependent reports now are more accessible to them; secondly, to \u2018join forces\u2019 with other\ncustomers and exchange opinions or experiences with consumers from around the world\nthus enabling e-word-of-mouth communication at unprecedented levels (e.g. bulleting\nboards and news groups). Finally, the communication between consumers and companies\nhas achieved new levels of interaction where personalised messages enable \u2018mass\nproduction\u2019 of tailor-made products. The Consumer Centric Marketing (CCM) is based on\na positive cycle of learning from customers \u2013 allowing the customers to take the driving\nseat in designing the product features - offering customers products with higher perceived\nvalue \u2013 increasing customer life time value.\nThis paper aims to explore the CCM concept and to demonstrate several applications in the\ntourism, travel and hospitality industries. Tourism related products and experiences are\nideal candidates for exploring CCM as consumers have been combining a wide range of\nproducts and services towards creating their service package and total experiences. The\n4tourism package is by definition an amalgam of often independently produced products and\nservices that include, for example, airline seats, hotel rooms, restaurants, guided tours,\ntheme parks, taxi rides etc. In most cases, consumers dynamically package their own\nproduct, often at the same time as consuming it (i.e. whilst at the tourism destination). They\ncustomise their product by communicating their wishes to suppliers through a range of\nmedia, including telephone requests, email and even face-to-face communication. For\nexample, consumers may request a window or aisle seat on an aircraft, a sea view or a non-\nsmoking room at a hotel or an extra pepperoni pizza at the restaurant. Technology not only\nenhances the channels of communications but also provides tools for the organisation to\nadapt proactive and reactive marketing strategy towards customising products and\nsatisfying customer demand (Buhalis, 2003).\nThe evolution of the CCM\nCCM builds on the techniques designed for Customer Relationship Management (CRM)\n(Daniel et al., 2003; O'Leary et al., 2004; Varey et al., 2002,). CCM is a more advanced\nmarketing philosophy than CRM in a sense that CCM truly \u2018places the customer in the\nmiddle\u2019: CCM also allows the organisation to gather very detailed information of their\ncustomers, thus accumulate a very deep understanding of customers served. This is enabled\nby networks, databases, data warehousing and data mining applications. The Web is used to\nenable consumer interactions, data collection and analysis. The Web also enables the\nidentification and tracking of the consumers (Wang et al. 2000).\nFurthermore, CCM derives from and finds its natural home in the packaged goods industry\nand much of the published work derives from this same sphere (Mello, 2002). This\n5business-to-consumer (B2C) approach could be explained as the \u2018good, old-fashioned\nservice\u2019, e.g. where the village doctor was able to know his clients very well and had the\nexpertise that helped to change the client\u2019s life. Yet CCM implies the organisation is\ncommunicating with multiple clients globally and is able to offer tailor-made products to\neach of them. Thus, it enables organisations to create one-to-many or B2C products and\nservices that are perceived unique or personalised by their customers. In essence, CRM\nrefers to the accumulation of knowledge about a consumer's needs and the utilization of\nthat knowledge to deliver customer satisfaction.\nThe major advancement by CCM is that the consumer is able to participate in the actual\nproduct design thus achieving greater customisation. The customers are invited to become\nthe \u2018architect\u2019 for the goods and services purchased, even giving the clients the opportunity\nto personalised and make changes to the products they have ordered. Furthermore, \u2019reach\n(people\/locations) and range (variety)\u2019 of CCM business opportunities has expanded\nglobally owing to the development of the Internet. Manufacturers, such as Dell or General\nMotors, can therefore communicate directly with the end-users and allow them to\npersonalise their products and services (Wang et al., 2000, p. 375).\nDefining Consumer Centric Marketing\nConsumer Centric Marketing can be defined as \u2018the discipline of capturing and deploying\nconsumer insights to enhance marketing effectiveness and better serve those consumers that\nare brand\u2019s best prospects\u2019 (Maney et al., 2002 p.3). In essence, the CCM is a three-step\nprocess:\n1) the collection and arrangement of information and data on individual customers,\n62) the utilisation of that information to more effectively target those existing customers\nand\n3) allowing the customer to customise and personalise the service to match their own\nneeds and preferences.\nTake in Figure 1\nOrganisations focus on creating value by providing the clients with the service they require\n(i.e. client-perceived value). In CCM this value creation is achieved through a combination\nof technology-driven processes and human inputs. These build a transaction environment\nthat allows customers to be the centre of the transaction, helping him design the product\nfeatures or choosing the most appropriate level and type of service and informing them\nabout new products relevant to them. This client-perceived value is critical and is often\nregarded as:\n\u2022 \u2018the fundamental basis for marketing (Parasuramam, 1997),\n\u2022 what holds transactions together as relationships (Mattson, 1997),\n\u2022 a key strategic variable to help explain repeat purchase behaviour, brand\nloyalty and commitment (Patterson and Spreng, 1997),\n\u2022 the next source of competitive advantage (Woodruff, 1997) and\n\u2022 one of the most successful competitive strategies of the 1990s (Ravald and\nGroonroos, 1996)\u2019 (as cited in Paulin et al., 2000, p. 456).\n7The prerequisites for successful CCM can be summarised in the following points: firstly the\ncompany needs to have a substantial amount of relevant information about the customers.\nMost companies do keep records\/databases of some kind but fail to put this data into\nunderstandable information and actionable knowledge. Secondly, the company needs to\noffer their clients suitable communications platforms or selling points (e.g. internet and call\ncentres) where the client can select the elements of their product (e.g. Bridge the World\noffers prospective clients the opportunity to design their own vacations and DELL\ncomputers allow clients to customise the design of their own PC on-line). Here technology\nis used to enable transactions between the customer and the company, reduce the costs of\nsuch interactivity, make these transactions more efficient as well as to strengthen the\nrelationship between the parties and create a degree of (perceived) interdependency (Mello,\n2002; Paulin, et al., 2000). In addition, technology enables the consumer to select what is\nimportant for them and to decide what they would like to pay for. Finally, the accumulated\nknowledge allows the design of personalised and meaningful messages to the customer\nregarding the features of the brand.\nCCM is based on a cyclical notion of building from a database to meaningful (two-way)\ncommunication with the end-use customer. Furthermore, the dialogue created re-enforces\nthe power of the database, thus allowing for more insightful communication with customers\nand building their trust towards the company. Customer satisfaction is also increased\nthrough this process of communication and customisation establishing a dialogue (B2C as\nwell as C2B) rather than a monologue. CCM is, therefore, a philosophy building on the\ntraditional market orientation, as well as innovation orientation, where managers learn from\ntheir customers and the customers learn from the technology enabled communication\n8originating from the company (Berthon, Hulbert and Pitt, 2004; Lietz, 2003). Organisations\nand customers interact dynamically to create the best possible solution which on the one\nhand adds value to the total customer experience and one the other improves loyalty and\nultimately profitability.\nCCM is also characterised by dynamic knowledge management, empowered by efficiencies\ngained through the 24\/7 communication utilising multiple points of communication\/entry\nbut feeding to centralised databases. This single repository of information reduces further\ndata duplication (e.g. for several Internet based services it is now a \u2018norm\u2019 to log on with a\ncustomer specific username) and increases the depth and value of the data held about each\ncustomer. It also enables organisations to deal consistently with the customer across\ndifferent locations and distribution channels.\nUltimately the company can deal with a target segment of just one customer. Thus \u2018firms in\nthe future will build their success on how much they know about their customers, how they\nwill provide them [customers] with information about their products and services, and how\nthey will profitably distribute those products and services in an information based\nenvironment\u2019 (Olsen and Connolly, 2000, p. 30). As service can be easily configured to\nindividual needs, CCM will enable organisations to deliver this level of service.\nCCM within the tourism industry context\nThe tourism, travel and hospitality industries have been revolutionised by the emerging\ntechnologies. Both interaction with customers and industry structures have experienced\ndramatic changes in the last decade (Buhalis, 2003; Werthner and Klein, 2000; Minghetti,\n2003; Piccoli, O'Connor, Capaccioli and Alvarez, 2003). On one hand, ICTs facilitate the\n9expansion of the industry and the enlargement of the market and on the other the growing\nvolume of demand require advanced ICTs for the management of tourism organisations.\nTechnological developments also propel a wide number of changes in the tourism industry\nmarketplace, particular in distribution and globalisation. A number of key trends in the\nglobal tourism industry have further accelerated the use of ICT in tourism as demonstrated\nin Table I.\nTake in table I\nThe emergence of CCM applications is a natural outcome of these following trends: brand\nand product proliferating; the fragmentation of traditional media and the emergence of new\ncommunication methods; the changing consumers; the increased channel power and\ndevelopments in ICT. The Product Lifecycles are becoming shorter and new innovative\nproducts are emerging regularly. Many of these products are \u2018educating\u2019 the consumers to\nchange their buying habits, e.g. the low cost airlines are encouraging travellers to depart\nfrom the traditional ready-made holiday packages and make private arrangements for their\nvacations, thus teaching consumers to seek out information from independent sources and\ndesign the features of their own vacations. The changes in the media are transparent as\nwell; digital TV and radio are being introduced together with interactive services. The 3G\nmobile technology will soon change the way we buy goods and services. E-mail, SPAM,\nWWW and WAP are already well established. As a result, on one hand, the consumers are\nbombarded by messages and their attention is now even harder to capture. On the other\nhand, technology can also be used to filter out unwanted messages thus allowing consumers\n10\nto choose which organisation they wish to enter into dialogue with. Permission based and\nhighly personalised marketing is now adding value to goods and services. The competition\nis likely to become more fierce (Maney et al., 2002).\nRelating CCM to traditional segmentation practice in tourism\nEvery tourist is different, carrying a unique blend of experiences, motivations and desires.\nThe Internet has revolutionised flexibility in both consumer choice and service delivery\nprocesses. Increasingly customers become much more sophisticated and discerning.\nTourists as consumers also become demanding, requesting high quality products and value\nfor their money and perhaps more importantly value for time for the entire range of their\ndealings with organisations.\nHaving experienced several tourism products and destinations, experienced, sophisticated,\ndemanding travellers rely heavily on electronic media to obtain information about destinations\nand experiences, as well as to be able to communicate their needs and wishes to suppliers\nrapidly (Buhalis, 2003). A wide range of personalisation approaches are emerging in the\nmarketplace, including recommender systems (Gretzel, et al., 2004; Minghetti, 2003; Ricci,\n2002).\nThe marketing practice, therefore, gradually evolves from mass marketing to effective\nsegmentation and targeting, advocating one-to-one (121) ICT-enabled marketing.\nTechnology and dynamic interaction for the first time ever makes customisation cost\neffective at large scale. It also offers the possibility to provide personalised products and\nservices at competitive prices. Figure 2 demonstrates how CCM relates to mass\/segmented\nmarketing:\n11\nTake in figure 2\nMass marketing typically involves goods that hold little importance in the eyes of the\nconsumer (low involvement). For that reason the customer is happy to accept marketing\ncommunication with no personalisation and there is no need to cultivate relationships\nbetween the supplier and the end-user (e.g. mass tourism sun-sand-sea packages).\nTraditionally consumers have been seen at the end of a \u2018chain\u2019, simply receiving the output\nof actions taken place earlier in this production chain. Yet consumers also perform their\nown marketing functions as they \u2018analyse their needs, seek information, compare the value\nof alternatives, and make decisions\u2019. Moreover, the Internet has empowered the consumers\nto make better informed decisions by introducing more transparency and making data\ngathering easier (Wang et al. 2000, p. 376). The consumers can also choose to begin a\nrelationship with the company by signing up for an Internet based service, thus providing\ndetails of their needs and wants, listing products of interest as well as contact details\n(mobile number and e-mail address). The more sophisticated the data provided by the\ncustomers the more satisfaction he can gain from this transaction. Hence it is in the\nconsumer\u2019s best interest to provide accurate and detailed information about themselves and\ntheir product preferences, thus creating the positive cycle of CCM.\nTargeted marketing is the classic segmentation approach where there is some understanding\nof the needs of the end-user and some degree of relationship may develop between\ncustomers and producers (e.g. pony trekking holidays targeted to riding club members).\nOne-to-one type of marketing is based on gaining real insight into the needs of the tourist\n12\nwith high degree of personalisation. For example, as demonstrated in Figure 3\norganisations such as Lastminute.com encourage consumers to register on their web site\nand declare personal information including age, marital status, number of children at home,\nhome ownership status and preferred airport. This information is then used to drive their\nnewsletters targeting specifically consumers according to family life cycle, income and life\nstyle. It is also used for allowing service providers to dynamically package different\nproducts and services by suggesting value added options that fit the customer profile as\ndemonstrated on the example by Lastminute.com in Figure 4. Effectively consumers are\ncreating their own experience by amalgamating or even customising tourism products to\ntheir needs and requirements.\nTake in Figure 3\nTake in Figure 4\nIn addition by allowing the client to customise his purchase by \u2018mixing and matching\u2019\ndifferent elements of the tourism product the online interactions can enhance the service\nfurther. A deep relationship between a tourist and a travel supplier may emerge (when, for\nexample, arranging a wedding in a foreign country) by using electronic media to facilitate\ninteraction. A \u2018cyber relationship\u2019 may also emerge between supplier and the traveller\nwhen the prospective client is allowed to customise parts of their purchase over the\nInternet. For example Air India allows the clients to select from a menu of over twenty\ndifferent types of meals at the time of booking.\n13\nHaving the possibility of identifying a target segment of just one customer can lead to\ntechnology myopia. It is important that such tunnel vision will not overshadow traditional\nmarketing wisdom and diminish the requirement for \u2018long term financial success for the\ncompany\u2019. It is therefore pertinent to revisit the segmentation concept. As a holiday\npurchase moves across the continuum towards the 1-to-1 type service model, the more\nimportant the traditional marketing wisdom and professional expertise about the product on\noffer becomes. The whole target market can be divided into three key segments ranging\nfrom A to C according to their ability to conform to products offered by an organisation, as\ndemonstrated in Table II.\nTake in table II\nHere is where the greatest risk for technology myopia lies. The initial investment of funds,\nstaff training and recruitment can create pressures to maximise the use of this technology\nthus extending the service offer to segments that would not have been considered viable for\n\u2018traditional\u2019 marketing. Although new viable segments are likely to emerge from such\nshifting of the marketing focus it is important to note that some customers, albeit ready to\nadopt CCM, will never create profits for all companies. Therefore the traditional marketing\nconcept of matching customers\u2019 wishes to company\u2019s products is still required. The fact\nthat CCM utilizes databases of customer buying behaviour potentially enables the sub-\nsegmenting of clients according to their profit potential. Hence critical appreciation of the\nnew applications needs to be exercised.\n14\nInformation Gathering Strategies\nCurrent use of the internet is already educating the consumer that they can exchange\npersonal information in return for better service, discounts, offer alerts, newsletters, ease of\nservice and customisation. By signing-up for an account with e-retailers and logging-in to\npersonalised account consumers can store their details and preferences; and, organisations\ncan track purchasing patterns to the degree of a \u2018segment of one\u2019. Furthermore, incentives\nlike discounts, loyalty points\/rewards, and prizes can be used to entice the consumers to\ncomplete an on-line survey. For example, Expedia and Eurostar allows registered\ncustomers to save regular services\/purchases and retrieve them instantly on return log-in.\nCookies can also be used to identify web based customers.\nIncreasingly recommender services emerge that employ intelligent agents and artificial\nintelligence to \u2018cut through\u2019 unlimited information and reach personalised solutions (Ricci,\n2004). Mobile phones are becoming invaluable assistance and support for people on the\nmove. The development of website services and a combination of 3G as well as location\nbased services will enable telecommunications networks and service providers to access\ncustomer profile, even current location and then send information of the relevant products\nand services.\nConsumers will be happy to part with personal information only when this serves a clear\nobjective of providing value adding services from specific organisations. If the organisation\nmisuses sensitive information or sells on to third parties they should be prepared to face the\nunhappy customers, negative WOM (multiplied by the power of e-communication) and\npotential legal action. Most importantly, consumers will loose trust and will break the\n15\nrelationship with the organisation. The Data Protection Act and other legislation also\ncontrol the use of personal information.\nInformation Utilization Strategies and future CCM prospects\nTourism CCM applications will be featuring services available to travellers before \u2013 during\n\u2013 after their trip. Much of the CCM of today focuses on the before the trip services, e.g.\ninternet sites that track the availability of flights, accommodation and holiday packages\naccording to the criteria set by users. CCM applications will follow the traveller whilst\naway from home, and will include wireless technology applications and made-to-order\nproducts and services. The digital format of the Web based interaction makes it easier to\nrecord communications between businesses, business partners and consumers as well as\nconsumer-to-consumer (C2C) (Wang et al., 2000). The after trip communications could\ninclude invitation to join moderated web discussion groups featuring special interests\ncentral to recent vacation (thus building towards customer loyalty and future bookings).\nWireless technology is becoming more common, as 3rd Generation mobile services, WIFI\nand Bluetooth applications increasingly allow two-way-always-on connectivity regardless\nof location. The early adopters are already comfortable with wireless connectivity, and soon\nthe mass market will start to demand opportunities to connect to the internet without being\ntied to a PC. There is a further trend of increasing use of hand-held devices that are\nbecoming smaller and more affordable whilst, mobile phones incorporating data based\napplications are already regarded as a necessity rather than luxury. Such data applications\ninclude logging expenditure; currency conventions; GPS based tracking of location\n16\n(Location Based Services, LBS) and automated messages of local partners, services.\nServices controlled through Internet browsers are also becoming increasingly popular, thus\nemphasising the importance of networking and sharing data about local attractions with\nglobal partners. Mobile applications will increasingly allow customers to check-in at\nairports and hotels; communicate boarding passes, vouchers and authentication information\nrequired for travel and immigration purposes. Furthermore, M-money can become the\ntravel currency of the future enabling consumers to \u2018load up\u2019 currency to their mobile\nphones and then pay for services simply by dialling up the service provider\u2019s numbers.\nMobile applications will enhance CCM as consumers will increasingly be able to\ncommunicate preferences electronically to service providers where they are. For example, a\ncustomer carrying Bluetooth enabled device will be automatically directed to a room of his\npreference when arriving in a CCM enabled hotel. Furthermore, this room will feature a\ncustomised welcome message including the customer\u2019s favourite picture, favourite music,\nroom temperature is automatically adjusted to his preference and the customers preferred\nbeverages will be available.\nThe made-to-order (MTO) concept appears to be at the centre of the CCM philosophy\nand is already in some use in the tourism industry. Typically a holiday package is made of\naccommodation + transport + meals + experience\/entertainment. Most of these sub-\ncomponents of vacation can be substituted by a competing supplier with no great\ncomplication. Internet providers such as expedia.co.uk and lastminute.com are already\nenabling this whilst Kuoni enables the customisation of the holiday packages according to\n17\nconsumer\u2019s requests. These systems are gradually becoming adaptive by learning from past\nexperience and projecting the declared preferences.\nThe CCM organisations use intelligent agents (based on artificial intelligence and neural\nnetworks) so the travellers can \u2018educate\u2019 the software of their preferences. Initially the\n\u2018Shopbots\u2019 will seek for services including specified attributes (e.g. adventurous holidays)\nand ignore other types of products. The programme monitors decisions made by the tourist\nand \u2018learn\u2019 from these transactions to be able to provide even more accurate matches to the\nsearch terms. This improves the suggestions offered to travellers whilst a comparison\nbetween users with similar profiles also educates the system about customer preferences.\nHence filtering away services that do not add perceived value to these individuals (Olsen\nand Connolly, 2000). \nA range of new technologies are emerging to assist consumers that have predetermined\nprofile or are guided by specific needs to reach tourism products and services that will\nsatisfy their needs and requirements. For example recommender systems are commonly\ndefined as applications that e-commerce sites exploit to suggest products and provide\nconsumers with information to facilitate their decision-making processes. They implicitly\nassume that we can map user needs and constraints, through appropriate recommendation\nalgorithms, and convert them into product selections using knowledge compiled into the\nintelligent recommender. Knowledge is extracted from either domain experts (content- or\nknowledge-based approaches) or extensive logs of previous purchases (collaborative-based\napproaches). For travel and tourism, the two most successful recommender system\ntechnologies are Triplehop\u2019s TripMatcher (used by www.ski-europe.com, among others)\nand VacationCoach\u2019s expert advice platform, Me-Print (used by travelocity.com). Both of\n18\nthese recommender systems try to mimic the interactivity observed in traditional\ncounselling sessions with travel agents when users search for advice on a possible holiday\ndestination (Ricci, 2002). A simpler application of that is the Expedia \u201cinspiration\u201d that\nencourages consumers to determine few variables and recommends products and services\naccordingly, as demonstrated in Figure 5.\nTake in Figure 5\nElectronic word-of-mouth: ICT is also allowing for positive and negative word-of-mouth\n(WOM) communication at an unprecedented scale across geographical borders. The\nRealholidayreports http:\/\/www.realholidayreports.com\/ displays feedback from ordinary\ntourists about the facilities in a destination. Internet search engines have also created\nunusual \u2018experts\u2019 of tourism products where a private web page may achieve the most hits\nfor a destination. Moreover, the information-savvy tourists are well connected through\nvirtual communities (e.g. www.virtualtourist.com and www.igougo.com ) where members\nhave the option to maintain their own travel web pages. These web pages can be visited and\nranked by other users of this service, hence appealing for the competitive instinct of the\ntourist and providing an incentive to provide accurate and enjoyable reports on travel\ndestinations and services. To conclude, such information based services can also achieve\nthe much coveted loyal clientele since \u2018the most successful competitors will collect and\nsynthesise information about their customers\u2019 buying patterns and convert this knowledge\nto a highly personalised service\u2019 (Olsen and Connolly, 2000, p. 31).\n19\nCaveats of CCM\nSeveral caveats are worth mentioning. CCM is already happening and while the CCM can\nbe labelled as an extension on CRM, its increasing importance in a rapidly fragmenting\nmarket-place makes it worthy of attention. Since ICT is putting CCM into the reach of\neveryone competition is intensifying as technological means to access individual customers\nare becoming easier. This is a conundrum and a double-edged sword and increasingly only\ninnovators will be able to maintain sustainable competitive advantage. Although the\ncustomers will be demanding the latest ICT solutions, the service industry may not be able\nto comply due to the initial investment required to achieve this as well as the difficulty to\ncalculate any rate of return for this investment (Olsen and Connolly 2000, p.32).\nCCM can also be cost inefficient as customisation has a higher per unit cost of production\nand this may affect the price of product as well as the its competitiveness. As with any new\ntechnology advancement, there will be initial resistance to sign-up for new services until\nconsumers understand and appreciate the value of this service and also until the security of\neach transaction can be guaranteed. Furthermore, the downloading times at the moment are\nrelatively slow, which limits the richness of data sent to the tourist whilst on vacation. The\n\u2018at destination\u2019 communication of today would involve mainly text, but once data roaming\nprocedures and downloading times can be reduced more multimedia communications can\nbe introduced and services such as \u2018virtual guides\u2019 and LBS will be introduced.\nWe speculate that the real \u2018bottle neck\u2019 for the implementation of these technology based\nmodels is the relatively low number of truly ICT savvy customers. The technology\ndescribed here is currently used by the consumers from the early adopters\/early majority\ngroup. The late majority group is potentially frustrated by their lack of understanding and\n20\nskill required to set up these ICT systems and the laggards are concerned with the perceived\nrisks associated with internet based transactions, in essence, lack of trust causes them to\nreject these new services (e.g. 84% of Americans worry about threats to privacy; 78% feel\nthey have lost control of how their personal data is used; Wang et al., 2000). Some of these\nconcerns can be counter-balanced by CCM organisations adhering to strict privacy controls\nand placing such policies prominently on their web pages. Credit card companies are also\neasing the discomfort felt by consumers by offering their customers protection against\nfraudulent use of their cards. External bodies like http:\/\/www.truste.com and\nhttp:\/\/www.webtrust.net\/ also offer guidance to organisations regarding customer privacy\nand data security. They can also help in lowering the perceived risk of on-line transactions\nby offering a \u2018seal of approval\u2019.\n21\nConclusions\nCustomer orientation and innovative thinking have been cited as the basis for best business\nperformance (Paulin et al., 2000). The balance between savings from technological\neffectiveness and providing customer centred service atmosphere is not an easy one.\nTechnology myopia can be a very alluring way to streamline customer service functions.\nYet this is not the true philosophy of CCM (Berthon et al., 2004). Like marketing itself,\nCCM is a philosophy, and approach that needs to be adopted and promoted throughout the\nfirm. Moreover, ICT is not the panacea for all marketing ills. However the need for, and\nopportunities arising from, individual consumer-focused marketing activities have perhaps\nnever been more relevant as \u2018it is the customer who determines what a business is\u2019\n(Drucker, 1954, p.37)\n22\nBibliography\nBerthon, P.
