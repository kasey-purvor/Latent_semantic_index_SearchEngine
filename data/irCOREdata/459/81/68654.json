Because they must reflect ongoing processes that\nnormally occur unseen, within the interior of the body, such signals repay close\nattention. In particular, they can be used to diagnose incipient pathophysi-\nological conditions before symptoms become obvious. A well-known example\nis the electrocardiogramme (ECG) signal, representing the electrical activity\nof the heart. ECG measurements have been used for diagnostic purposes for\nalmost a century. For the first several decades of such measurements, atten-\ntion was focussed mainly on the detailed shape of the approximately periodic\npulses seen in the signal. More recently, however, attention has shifted to the\nseparation of the pulses because it has become apparent that the heart of a\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\nPublished in Physica A 314, 69-76 (2012).\nhealthy human in repose does not beat at a constant rate. Rather, the car-\ndiac frequency varies in time, a phenomenon known as heart-rate variability\n(HRV).\nGene Stanley and his group have probably done more than anyone to try to\ncharacterise and analyse cardiovascular signals, so it is a particular pleasure\nto have been invited to present a paper on this topic in Messina. Approaches\nto the problem introduced by different authors have included, for example,\nstudies of: Fourier spectra [1]; chaotic behaviour[2,3]; wavelet spectra [4\u20136];\nKarhunen-Loe`ve decomposition [7]; scaling properties [8\u201313]; Lyapunov expo-\nnents [14]; multifractal properties [15,16]; correlation integrals [17]; 1\/f spectra\n[18\u201320]; and synchronization properties [21\u201325]. The two extreme perceptions\nof HRV consider it to be deterministic in origin, e.g. sometimes resulting in de-\nterministic chaos [2,3], or stochastic [26]. It is not immediately obvious which\nof these several diverse approaches is the most promising: the criteria to be\nmet, presumably, are that the technique of analysis should (i) be able to deal\nsuccessfully with time variations of characteristic frequencies and amplitudes,\nand that (ii) it should yield some insight into the physiological processes re-\nsponsible for the HRV, so that (iii) their individual function \u2013 normal or\npathological \u2013 can be evaluated separately for diagnostic purposes.\nIn this paper we focus on the results obtained through use of one of the\ntechniques mentioned above, wavelet analysis [4,27], and we point out that it\napparently meets all three criteria. In Sec. 2 we summarise the experimental\ninformation obtained by this method and, in Sec. 3 we show how it can be\naccounted for in terms of mutually interacting oscillatory processes each of\nwhich appears to relate to a distinct physiological mechanism. In Sec. 4 we\nreport the present status of attempts to model the cadiovascular system as\na set of coupled oscillators, showing that important features of the measured\nsignals can be reproduced by the model. In Sec. 5 we draw conclusions and\ntry to point the way forward.\n2 Cardiovascular signals\nMany different protocols have been used for acquiring cardiovascular data, one\nof the most thorough being that described in [27] where ECG, blood pressure,\nand blood flow rate are recorded simultaneously over a period of about 20\nminutes. Interest centres on the bloodflow circulatory control mechanisms,\nand so any processes occurring on timescales longer than about 1 minute\n(the average circulation period) are ignored. For healthy subjects in repose,\nthe results are typically as in Fig. 1(a); Fig. 1(b) shows the averaged wavelet\ntransform of the same data, but calculated over the full 20 minutes. A detailed\ndiscussion of such results is presented in [27], but it is immediately evident\n2\nRespiration (a)\nECG\nHRV\nBlood pressure\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\nBlood flow 1\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nBlood flow 2\nTime (s)\n(b)0.18 Hz\n1.1 Hz\n0.18 Hz\n0.36 Hz\n0.18 Hz0.09 Hz\n0.026 Hz0.011 Hz\n1.1 Hz\nAv\ner\nag\ne \nwa\nve\nle\nt t\nra\nns\nfo\nrm\n1.1 Hz\n0.11 Hz0.03 Hz\n0.014 Hz\n0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 1\n1.1 Hz0.18 Hz0.091 Hz\n0.032 Hz0.012 Hz\nFrequency (Hz)\nFig. 1. Samples of cardiovascular signals (a) and time averages of their wavelet\ntransforms (b). The positions of the peaks are almost the same for all signals, while\nthe corresponding amplitudes may be considerably different. After [27].\nthat \u2013\n\u2022 There are (at least) five characteristic spectral peaks.\n\u2022 Remarkably, the same, or almost the same, peaks appear in all the spectra,\nregardless of where or how the corresponding signals were recorded, though\nthere are considerable differences in amplitude.\n\u2022 All the peaks are broadened.\nA clue to the origin of some of the broadening can be found by inspection of\nthe full time-frequency wavelet spectrum, part of which is shown in Fig. 2. It\ncan be seen that both the instantaneous amplitudes and central frequencies\nvary in time, giving rise to a considerable part of the broadening observed in\nthe averaged spectra of Fig. 1(b).\nWhat is the origin of this frequency and amplitude wandering? It appears that\nthe instantaneous frequency of any given spectral peak oscillates. It does so at\nthe frequency of the spectral peak next-lowest in frequency, with contributions\ncoming from all of the other oscillatory processes too. HRV, for example, is a\nsignal representing the variations of the cardiac frequency, and from Fig. 1(b)\nwe can see (third spectrum from the top) that its oscillations are also mod-\nulated by the processes with frequencies near 0.011, 0.026, 0.10, and 0.18 Hz\n(as well as its own second harmonic at 0.036 Hz). Such observations can be\nconstrued as evidence that the five oscillatory processes are mutually coupled.\nThey seem to influence each other via couplings at least some of which are\nparametric, thus giving rise to the observed frequency modulation.\n3\n540\n550\n560\n570\n3\n1\n0.3\n0.1\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\nTime (s)Frequency (Hz)\nW\nav\nel\net\n tr\nan\nsf\nor\nm\n (A\nU)\n540 545 550 555 560 565 570\n100\n150\n200\n250\nAm\npl\nitu\nde\n (A\nU)\n540 545 550 555 560 565 570\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n1.15\nFr\neq\nue\nnc\ny \n(H\nz)\nTime (s)\nFig. 2.

On the right are plotted the amplitude and frequency variations of the\nheartrate peak. After [5].\n3 Interacting oscillatory processes\nWith varying degrees of confidence, all of the oscillatory processes can now be\nrelated to underlying physiological mechanisms. Their characteristic average\nfrequencies vary slightly between individuals, and, in some cases, between dif-\nferent measurement locations, but in each case they lie within definite limits.\nThe physiological origins of the peaks at 1 Hz (heart beat), and 0.2 Hz (respi-\nration) are obvious. It is reasonably well established that the peak at 0.1 Hz\nis attributable to intrinsic myogenic activity of smooth muscles [28\u201330]. The\n0.03 Hz peak is apparently connected to autonomous nervous control [31,32]\n(neurogenic), and there is strong evidence that the 0.01 Hz peak arises from\nmetabolically related endothelial activity [33,34].\nThus wavelet analysis of signals from the cardiovascular system provides a\nnoninvasive technique for acquiring information about these distinct physio-\nlogical processes. Additional information, yielding deeper insight into the dy-\nnamics, can also be inferred from the couplings between the processes. These\ncan manifest themselves either through mutual modulation (Fig. 2) or through\nsynchronization between two or more of the processes. Which of these phe-\nnomena occurs in any given case probably depends partly on the strength\nof the coupling and partly on how close in frequency low harmonics of the\nprocesses would be to each other in the absence of coupling. In practice, mea-\nsurements on healthy subjects show transient episodes of cardio-respiratory\nsynchronization lasting typically a few tens of seconds. The average length\nof these episodes depends on the physiological state, and differs between e.g.\nathletes, sedentary individuals, and patients with pathological conditions such\nas diabetes.\nSynchronization effects are potentially of particular interest because of the\n4\ninformation they carry about the couplings. But, with the exception of the\ncardio-respiratory coupling, they have not yet been closely studied. A major\ndifficulty is that, unlike the heart and respiration, the lower-frequency pro-\ncesses do not give rise to separate signals that can be acquired noninvasively.\nIn practice, therefore, it is necessary to infer the existence or absence of syn-\nchronization from univariate time series. This challenging problem is already\nbeing approached in three distinct ways: (i) filtration of the univariate data\nto create two \u201cseparate\u201d signals that can then be tested for mutual synchro-\nnization [23] using established techniques such as synchrogrammes [21] or syn-\nchronization indices [35]; (ii) the use of angles-of-return-time maps [25,36]; and\n(iii) bispectral analysis [37]. In each case, it has been possible to derive infor-\nmation about the presence or absence of synchronization between the 0.1 Hz\n(myogenic) process and respiration or heartbeat. Problems of resolution \u2013 in\ntime, frequency and phase \u2013 have so far made it impossible to obtain synchro-\nnization information for the 0.03 Hz (neurogenic) and 0.01 Hz (endothelial)\nprocesses.\nNote that the three lower frequencies are derived in each case from spatially\ndistributed processes. Within each of them, there must be significant global\nsynchronization because, if this were not the case, low frequency oscillations\nwould be undetectable in centrally measured quantities such as HRV (Fig.\n1(b)) because they would all have averaged out.\nTo make further progress, it is necessary to develop a model to which the\ncardiovascular data can be fitted. One may then hope to characterise different\nphysiological and pathophysiological conditions quantitatively in terms of the\nmodel parameters.\n4 A coupled oscillator model of the cardiovascular system\nGiven the clear evidence of (a) well-defined spectral peaks (implying the pres-\nence of oscillatory processes) and (b) amplitude and frequency modulation,\nand synchronization effects (all indicating the existence of inter-oscillator in-\nteractions), it is natural to try to model the system with a set of oscillators\n[38] whose couplings [39] can be adjusted to try to reproduce the observed\nphenomena.\nLittle experimental information exists yet about either the nature of the cou-\nplings or the details of the oscillators. So we have used [38] the Poincare\u00b4\noscillator\nx\u02d9i = \u2212xiqi \u2212 \u03c9iyi + gxi(x),\ny\u02d9i = \u2212yiqi + \u03c9ixi + gyi(y), qi = \u03b1i(\n\u221a\nx\n2\ni + y\n2\ni \u2212 ai),\n(1)\n5\nwhere, x, y are vectors of the oscillator state variables, \u03b1i, ai, and \u03c9i are\nconstants and gyi(y) and gxi(x) are linear coupling vectors. Although to some\nextent this choice is arbitrary, (1) possesses properties of structural stability,\nrobustness and symmetry consistent with physiological understanding and the\nanalyses of measured time series.\nUsing a numerical simulation [39] of five coupled oscillators (1), with character-\nistic frequencies chosen to accord with measured data (Fig. 1), and amplitudes\nset initially to unity, we find that we can generate signals that to the eye seem\nin many respects to resemble those from the cardiovascular system. We were\nespecially interested to establish whether frequency and amplitude modula-\ntion would occur with short episodes of synchronization at random intervals,\nas observed in the experiments. The investigations are still at an early stage,\nbut we have already established: (a) that the observed depth of modulation\nrequires parametric couplings (as expected); (b) that with appropriately cho-\nsen parameter values parametric modulation indeed gives rise to episodes of\nsynchronization, but of course in a totally deterministic fashion with equal in-\ntervals between the episodes; and (c) with purely linear couplings, and added\nnoise (random fluctuations), the synchronization episodes occur briefly and\nrandomly just as observed in reality. An example showing the modelling of\ncardiorespiratory synchronization is shown in Fig. 3. It appears, therefore,\nthat both linear and parametric couplings exist and that it is essential to take\ninto account the influence of stochastic effects resulting from the (unmodelled)\nrest of the system.\n5 Conclusions\nInformation derived from analysis of cardiovascular signals in the time-frequency\nand time-phase domains has led to a coupled oscillator model able to reproduce\nmany features seen in the data. From the model, we conclude that cardiovascu-\nlar signals have a strong deterministic element, but that random noise (i.e. ex-\nternal influences and all effects not explicitly considered) also plays a crucially\nimportant role. Our approach meets all three of the criteria mentioned in Sec.\n1. In particular, it relates the underlying physiological processes to particular\nspectral peaks and thus allows them to be studied individually. Furthermore,\nit promises quantitative evaluation of the couplings between them. The latter\nfeature is potentially of particular interest for diagnosis and treatment because\nit enables the function and health of the cardiovascular system as a whole to\nbe evaluated.\n6\n0 50 100 150 200\n\u22121\n0\n1\nx1\ntime, s\n(a)\n0 50 100 150 200\n\u22122\n0\n2\nx2\ntime, s\n(b)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4\n10\u22125\n100\nS(f)\nf, Hz\n(d)\n0 50 100 150 200\n0\n2\n4\n6\nph\nas\ne \nm\nod\n 2\npi\ntime, s\n(c)\nFig. 3.
