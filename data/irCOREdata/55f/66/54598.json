Unlike \nprevious techniques, the resulting converter provides near constant steady-state output current over an \nextended load range when excited at the resonant frequency, through use of a self-oscillating \ncontroller.  \nIntroduction \nIt is well established that resonant converters are advantageous in-terms of size and efficiency. This \npaper first establishes that an LCC current-output converter can be made to perform as a constant \ncurrent-source at the resonant frequency and then provides a simple design process. \n \nMany of the underlying equations used in the proposed methodology have been previously reported \n[1-3]. The design process utilises the accuracy of Fundamental Mode Approximation (FMA), at the \nresonant frequency, and the potential for rapid analysis that it provides. The analysis is based on the \nLCC current-output resonant converter shown in Figure.1.  \n \nCf RL vo vcf\nCpvcp\nLs Cs\nvcs\nIr \nVi \nVdc \nN : 1\nLfIlf \n \n(a) \n \n \n \n  \n(b) (c)  \n \n \nFig. 1: LCC current-output resonant converter (a) schematic (b) prototype converter  \n(c) self-oscillating phase lock controller \n \nDesign Methodology \nIn [3] it is shown that the tank components are related to the tank gain at resonance Gtr, the \ntransformer turns ratio N , the resonant switching frequency fr, the parallel to series capacitor ratio \n(A=Cp\/Cs) and load resistance RL as follows: \n \nwhere A=Cp\/Cs, Gtr is the tank gain at resonance i.e Vo=Vin Gtr \/N at resonance, fr is the resonant \nfrequency and RL is the load resistance. \n \nIt is now shown that as the load resistance is increased, the converter output current tends to a constant \nvalue.  Solving both (1) and (2) for fr equating the results and further solving for Gtr gives:  \nNow, for a given output current, the tank gain at resonance can be calculated as follows: \nsubstituting (3) into (4) gives an expression for the output current as load is varied and the converter \nswitched at resonance. \n \nrL\ntr\np fRN\nG\nC 23\n42 16\n\u03c0\n\u03c0 \u2212\n=  \n(1) \n( )( )\n164\n161\n4223\n422\n\u2212\n\u2212+\n=\n\u03c0\u03c0\n\u03c0\ntrtrr\ntrL\ns\nGGf\nGARNL  \n(2) \nXACRNL\nL\nG pLs\ns\ntr +++= )1(644\n2 424\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n \nwhere ( ) ( )282484242 111284096 ++\u2212+= ACRNACRNLLX pLpLss \u03c0\u03c0  \n(3) \nNR\nGVI\nL\ntrin\no =  \n(4) \nThe output current ideally tends to a constant minimum value as the load resistance is increased and \nthe converter switched at resonance. This can be shown by taking the limit of (4) as RL\u2192 \u221e (open-\ncircuit) after Gtr is eliminated through the use of (3) giving: \nThis is the minimum output current the converter will produce when excited about the resonant \nfrequency. When the load resistance is lowered, the output current will be larger. Given that the \nmaximum current (at minimum load resistance) is K times larger than the minimum current \n(Io_max=K.Io_min) allows the required value of A to be calculated.  Solving (5) for Cp\/Ls then yields: \nDividing (1) by (2) , eliminating Gtr through the use of (4), replacing Io with K.Io_min and RL with RL_min, \nequating the result with (6) and finally solving for A gives: \nIt is now possible to generate a constraint on the minimum and maximum allowed values of N for a \ngiven design specification. To generate the minimum, the value of A must never be -ve, hence, solving \nfor N in (7) at A=0 gives: \nTo generate the maximum value, solving (7) for the limit of N as A \u2192 \u221e gives the following \nconstraint: \nHence, for a given specification, the range of N must first be calculated, the transformer turns ratio N \nspecified, the capacitor ratio A calculated from (7), the Gtr calculated at the minimum load by \nassuming Io=K.Io_min and solving (4), and finally computing the required components from (1) and (2). \nThe minimum resonant frequency corresponds to fr. The peak resonant frequency will correspond to \nthe resonant frequency of the converter with the rectifier disconnected. \n \nThe methodology is now applied to the design of a constant current converter. The specifications for \nthe supply are provided in Table 1.  \nTable 1 \u2013 DC-DC Converter Specifications \nDC Input \nVoltage \nCurrent source \nRange \nOutput voltage Range \n18V 0\u00c61A 10\u00c620V \n \n \nThe theoretical open circuit output current, at resonance, is selected to be 10% larger than the required \npeak current, thereby ensuring that parasitic effects (such as diode voltage drops) will not reduce the \ns\npin\no L\nACNV\nI\n2\n1\nmin_\n+\n=  \n(5) \n22\n2\nmin_\n)1(\n4\nin\no\ns\np\nVAN\nI\nL\nC\n+\n=  \n(6) \n( )\n( )( )2242min_22min_2\n222242\nmin_\n22\nmin_\n161\n)1(161\ninLo\ninLo\nVKRNIK\nKVKKRNI\nA\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212+\u2212\n\u2212=\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n \n(7) \nN\nKRI\nV\nLo\nin <2\nmin_min_\n4\n\u03c0\n \n(8) \n1\n4\n2\nmin_min_\n2\n\u2212\n<\nKIR\nVN\noL\nin\n\u03c0\n \n(9) \ncurrent so as to make the design ineffective and will ensure above-resonance operation at the peak \nrequired output current,. Therefore Io_min=1.1A. Now, selecting K = 1.1 ensures that at the minimum \nspecified load resistance, the output current at resonance will not exceed 1.21A.  Equations (8) and (9) \nprovide a constraint on the range of N. At 1A output, the minimum load resistance is 10\u2126, hence \n0.60<N<1.45. Selecting an N of 1 for simplicity and reduction in converter cost, gives a Gtr=0.672 and \nfrom (7) the value of A is therefore found to be 0.582. Assuming a minimum switching resonant \nfrequency of 133kHz, the required tank components from (1) and (2) are Cp=128nF Cs=220nF and \nLs=13.6uH. \n \nFor the component values selected above, Fig. 2 provides the steady-state output current when \nswitched at resonance, as the load is varied. The data is obtained from a prototype converter, ideal \nsimulation, and design process (see equations (3) & (4)). \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n1.15\n1.2\n1.25\nLoad resistance, Ohms\nO\nu\ntp\nu\nt c\nu\nrr\nen\nt, \nA\nExperimental\nSimulated\nDesign process\n \n(a) \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n1\n1.02\n1.04\n1.06\n1.08\n1.1\nLoad resistance, Ohms\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n \no\nu\ntp\nu\nt c\nu\nrr\nen\nt\nNormalised Experimental\nNormalised Simulation\nNormalised Design Procedure\n \n(b) \n \nFig. 2:  (a) Output current (b) normalised output current w.r.t ideal converter simulation as load is \nvaried from 5\u2126 to 10\u2126 when switched at resonance \n \nFrom Fig. 2(a) it can be seen that the prototypes\u2019 steady-state output current varies little as the load is \nchanged and the converter switched at resonance. Since a series-inductor resistance of 0.15\u2126 is \npresent in the converter, it is expected that the experimental output-current data will be slightly lower \nthan that of the ideal simulated converter. Note that from an ideal perspective the presence of a \nforward voltage drop should not reduce the output current below the theoretical open-circuit current \nsince the diodes effectively make the load resistance appear larger, thus forcing the converter to \nnaturally compensate by increasing the resonant tank current. Figure 2(b) provides a measure of error \nin the proposed analysis. In the presented data, the largest error between the analysis and simulated \nideal converter is approximately 4%. The maximum error between experimental output-current and \nthe analysis occurs at the highest output power, and is approximately 10%. This makes the design \nprocess ideal for prototype component selection especially when one considers the simplicity of the \nequations.  \n \n  \nA benefit of the proposed design procedure, when a constant load current is desired, is the ability to \noperate near resonance across the full load range. This maximises the converter efficiency since less \nreactive power is present in the resonant tank. Figure 3, provides the efficiency of the prototype \nconverter for the load range specified in Table 1, when switched at resonance. \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\n85\n86\n87\n88\n89\n90\n91\n92\n93\n94\n95\nLoad resistance, Ohms\nCo\nn\nv\ner\nte\nr \ne\nffi\nc\nie\nn\nc\ny,\n \n%\n \nFig. 3:  Prototypes efficiency when operated at resonance over the specified load range \n \nConclusion \n \nAn LCC resonant converter current-source design methodology, based on the FMA analysis \ntechnique, has been presented. The steady-state output current has been shown to remain near constant \nover an extended load range when switched at the resonant frequency. If supplied by a constant \nvoltage, the converter is capable of virtually constant output-current regulation in open-loop via a self-\noscillating at resonance switching mechanism. Results from a prototype converter have validated the \nproposed methodology.  \n \n \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n[1] R. L.
