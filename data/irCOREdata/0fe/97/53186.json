Introduction \nA great many laser processing procedures are intrinsically influenced by the depth to which a laser \nbeam is absorbed by a material\u2019s surface. It is therefore essential for both scientists and engineers to \nhave knowledge of how far a particular laser beam is absorbed by a certain material. Such \ninformation is clearly necessary for those interested in the laser processing of cement and concrete. \nTo date, many studies have been carried out to investigate the laser processing of concrete. Most of \nthe research, however, has concentrated on the laser cutting of concrete and reinforced concrete using \nhigh power CO2 lasers [1-3], the sealing\/fixing radioactive contamination onto concrete surfaces [4-7] \nand the production of novel surfaces [8-10] by means of CO2 laser glazing of the ordinary Portland \ncement (OPC) surface of the concrete. In all of these studies, however, spallation and excessive \ncracking and porosity formation were found to be major problems undermining the performance of \nthe laser glazed region. In contrast, the treatment of the OPC surface of concrete using a high power \ndiode laser (HPDL) has been shown to occasion a glaze that does not suffer from spallation or display \nexcessive cracking and porosity formation [11, 12]. It is believed that the absorption length of the \nlaser radiation for the OPC surface of the concrete has a significant influence on these observed \ndifferences in performance.  \n2. Experimental procedures \nIn this work a CO2 laser (Rofin-Sinar) emitting at 10.6\u00b5m with a maximum output power of 1 kW and \na HPDL (Diomed) emitting at 810\u00b120nm with a maximum output power of 60 W were employed. \nThe CO2 laser beam was delivered to the work surface by focusing the beam through               a 150 \nmm focal length KC1 lens to give a stable diverging beam. The HPDL beam was delivered to the \nwork area by means of a 4 m long, 600 \u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of which                     \nwas connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly. In both instances the laser optics were protected by \nmeans of a coaxially blown Ar shield gas jet a rate of 5 l min-1. Both lasers produced a multi-mode \nbeam. The laser fluences were set such that no melting occurred. The absence of melting was verified \nby subjecting the irradiated areas to an X-ray diffraction (XRD) to ensure the OPC retained its \ncrystallinity. In order to obtain results of a practical and useful nature the cement used in the \nexperiments was the common \u2018as cast\u2019 OPC surface of concrete. In this case the OPC surface of the \n  4 \nconcrete had a thickness of 2.5 mm. For the purpose of experimental convenience the as-received \nconcrete blocks were sectioned into squares (120 x 120 x 20 mm) prior to laser treatment. The cement \nwas treated with both lasers at room temperature and in normal atmospheric conditions.  \n3. Determination of absorption length \nAs one can see from figure 1 and figure 2, the ablation depth rate per shot, h, for the OPC surface of \nthe concrete irradiated with both lasers was seen to exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the laser \nfluence, E. An optical profiling system (ProScan) was employed to determine the values of h for the \nvarious values of E. It is evident from both figure 1 and figure 2 that a threshold for discernible \nmaterial removal exists, with the minimum required fluence being approximately 68 J cm-2 for the \nCO2 laser and approximately 135 J cm\n-2 for the HPDL. Although this approach has been adopted \npreviously to examine pulsed lasers (excimer) and shown to be sound [13], the technique has also \nbeen used to investigate continuous wave (CW) lasers [14]. Moreover, the distinct linearity of the \ndata points further validates the use of this approach for the examination of CW lasers. It is important \nto note that this would assume a minimum conduction loss. However, concrete has relatively low \nthermal conductivity, thus it is reasonable to suppose the laser power densities used were high \nenough and the pulses short enough to minimise the thermal conduction loss. \nSince the energy deposition profile will be governed by the optical absorption coefficient, \u03b1, then the \ndepth of material removed per shot, h, is given by Beer-Lambert\u2019s law: \n h\nE\nE\nt\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\n1\n\u03b1\nln  (1) \nwhere, Et, is the threshold value of the fluence at which significant material removal occurs and is \ndefined as [13] \n \n( )\nE\nH C T\nR\nt\np d=\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c1\n\u03b1 1\n (2) \nHere, H is the latent heat of fusion, \u03c1 the density, Cp the specific heat and R the reflectivity. Td is \nsome critical temperature at which rapid thermal degradation of the material occurs leading to the \nproduction of volatile fragments within the thermal time scale of the experiments. It is important to \nnote that (1) takes no account of absorption of incident radiation by the plume of removed material \n  5 \nand likely changes in the material\u2019s level of absorption as removal progresses. Nonetheless, as the \nwork of Andrew et al. [13] and Schmidt et al. [14] demonstrated this simple form of the expression is \nquite adequate as a first approximation. By rearranging (1) in terms of the absorption length, 1\/\u03b1, \nthus: \n \n1\n\u03b1\n=\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f7\nh\nE\nE\nt\nln\n (3) \nthen it is possible to determine the absorption length of both CO2 and HPDL radiation into the OPC \nsurface of the concrete. By introducing the ablation depth rate per shot, h, and the corresponding \nvalue of laser fluence, E, for each data point into (3) it was possible to calculate the average \nabsorption length for each laser under the actual experimental conditions. These were found to be \n1\/\u03b1=470\u00b122 \u00b5m for the CO2 laser and 1\/\u03b1=177\u00b115 \u00b5m for the HPDL. \n4. The effects of differing absorption lengths on the depth of melting \nThe practical implications of the significant differences in the absorption length of the CO2 laser and \nthe HPDL can be seen in figure 3. Here the incident beams of both lasers on the OPC surface of the \nconcrete were traversed across the surface thus generating a single melt track. In both instances the \npower density was fixed at 780 W cm-2 (power 55 W and spot diameter 3 mm) whilst the traverse \nspeed was set at 540 mm min-1. As one can see clearly from figure 3, the maximum depth of melting \nachieved when employing the CO2 laser was 600 \u00b5m compared with around 300\u00b5m when using the \nHPDL. This is perhaps surprising when one considers the thermal diffusion length, zt, which is given \nby \n z at\nt\n= 2  (4) \nwhere, a, is the thermal diffusivity of the material and, t, is the beam material interaction time. \nClearly, according to (4), the thermal diffusion length, and hence melting, is a function of the \nmaterial. Therefore some other factor must come into play in order to cause the differences in the \nmelt depth experienced by the OPC surface of the concrete when exposed to CO2 and HPDL \nradiation. \n  6 \nThe two most prominent factors that may influence the melt depth differences are arguably the \nabsorption length, 1\/\u03b1, and the actual absorptivity of the OPC surface of the concrete. Absorptivity \nmeasurements made at room temperature revealed that the OPC surface of the concrete absorbed \naround 75% of CO2 laser radiation and around 69% of HPDL radiation. Since these figures are \nsimilar, it is perhaps reasonable to assume that absorption length is the primary influence on the melt \ndepth. \n5. Conclusions \nBy employing Beer-Lambert\u2019s law, the laser beam absorption lengths of CO2 and a high power diode \nlaser (HPDL) radiation for concrete were determined. The absorption lengths for concrete of CO2 and \na HPDL radiation were 470\u00b122 \u00b5m and 177\u00b115 \u00b5m respectively. Further, this difference in \nabsorption length was apparent from a cross-sectional analysis of the melt region produced by both \nlasers, which revealed melting occurred to a greater depth when the CO2 laser was used. \nThe primary factors that may influence the melt depth differences are arguably the absorption length \nand the actual absorptivity of the OPC surface of the concrete. But, absorptivity measurements made \nat room temperature revealed that the OPC surface of the concrete absorbed around 75% of CO2 laser \nradiation and around 69% of HPDL radiation. Thus, since these figures are similar, it is reasonable to \nassume that absorption length is the principal influence on the melt depth. \n \n  7 \nReferences \n1. Sugita K, Mori M, Fujioka T.
