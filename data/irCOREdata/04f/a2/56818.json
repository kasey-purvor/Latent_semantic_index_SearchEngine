First, it provides a critical appraisal of the theoretical accounts of globalisation\/regionalisation provided by the left \\ud\nstructuralist or \u2018hyperglobalist\u2019 approach and the new constitutionalist version of the neo-Gramscian approach. It is argued that both approaches have been essentially negative in their evaluation of the role and position of organised labour in the changing IPE. Such pessimism is particularly marked (perhaps not surprisingly) in the left structuralist approach, but nevertheless (and more\\ud\nsurprisingly) still pervades the new constitutionalism.
