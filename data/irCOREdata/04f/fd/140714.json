The deposition \nprocess has been investigated using 125I labelled anti-digoxin to determine optimal fabrication \nprotocols.  Antibody integrity and activity, together with non-specific binding of antigen on the \nconducting matrix have also been investigated using tritiated digoxin to probe       \npolypyrrole\/anti-digoxin films.  Amperometric responses to digoxin were recorded in flow \nconditions using these films, but the technique was limited in use mainly due to baseline \ninstability. \nAnti-BSA - polypyrrole matrices were investigated in more detail in both flow and \nquiescent conditions. No observable response was found in flow conditions, however under \nquiescent conditions (in non-stirred batch cell), anti-BSA \u2013 polypyrrole films have been \ndemonstrated to function as novel quantitative chronoamperometric immuno-biosensors when \ninterrogated using a pulsed potential waveform. The behaviour of the electrodes showed that the \nantibody\/antigen binding and\/or interaction process underlying the response observed was \nreversible in nature, indicating that the electrodes could be used for multiple sensing protocols.  \nCalibration profiles for BSA demonstrated linearity for a concentration range of 0-50 ppm \nbut tended towards a plateau at higher concentrations. Factors relating to replicate sensor \nproduction, sample measurement and reproducibility are discussed. \n 2\nINTRODUCTION \nSince the principle of immunoassay was first published by Yallow and Berson in 1959 [1] \nthere has been an exponential growth in both the range of analytes to which the technique has \nbeen successfully applied and the number of novel assay designs.  Developments in \nimmunoassay techniques have led to improvements in user-friendliness and sensitivity compared \nwith many other traditional techniques such as mass spectrometry and gas liquid \nchromatography.  The development of enzyme-labelled immunoanalytical techniques e.g. \nEnzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) has also provided analytical tests without the \nsafety risks associated with radiolabelling-based techniques. \nA direct immunosensor that does not rely on the use of a detectable label could lead to \nsimpler assay formats and ideally lower times of detection.  The rapid measurement of analytes \nof clinical significance e.g. towards various disease markers could in turn permit earlier \nintervention, which in a medical setting is frequently of utmost importance.  A reusable and rapid \ndetection system would, moreover, allow for continuous real-time measurement, so helping to \nmaintain optimal homeostatic conditions.  The development of reversible immunosensors \ntowards measurement of the antibody-antigen reaction in real time has been limited by the nature \nof the antibody-antigen reactions, many of which are not readily reversible.  Antibodies bind \nsolely to their antigens and achieve specificity via a complex series of multiple non-covalent \nbonds. In such processes there are no newly formed molecules, protons or electrons that are \neasily detectable, which has limited the development of direct antibody affinity-type sensors.  \nAdditionally, since the antibody-antigen binding event is often irreversible (affinity binding \nconstants typically range from 105 to 1011 mol. l-1) many contemporary immunosensors are only \nof use for \u201cone-shot\u201d analyses and therefore must be disposable in nature. \n The incorporation of antibodies into conducting polymer films was first reported by John et \nal [2]. Anti-human serum albumin (anti-HSA) was incorporated into a polypyrrole film, which \n 3\nwas galvanostatically polymerised onto a platinum wire substrate.  When grown in the absence of \na counterion, a poor polymeric film, both in appearance and electrochemical properties, resulted \nsuggesting that the presence of a counterion was necessary for the polymerisation process to be \nsuccessful. Amino acid analysis of the polymer using a leucine marker showed that \napproximately 0.1% w\/v (0.2\u00b5g) of the antibody was incorporated into the matrix. When the \npyrrole anti-HSA electrode was exposed to 50\u00b5g ml-1 HSA for ten minutes, a new reduction peak \nwas observed at a potential of approximately +600mV vs. Ag\/AgCl. This peak increased in \nmagnitude after a further thirty minutes in the same solution and it was suggested this could be \ndue to an antibody\/antigen interaction with the polymer. Further work by the same group gave \nrise to reports of a reversible real-time immunosensor [2]. Using a square wave potential pulse \nwaveform, a transient amperometric response was measured that appeared proportional to the \nconcentration of antigen in the sample, with detection limits being reported as low as 5 ppm [3]. \nThis technique of pulsed amperometric detection was transferred to other analytes, including      \np-cresol [4], Thaumatin [5] and polychlorinated biphenyls [6].  \n  Other workers have attempted to reproduce the work on HSA reported in these papers with \nlittle success [7], however during our investigations into the production of conducting polymer \nantibody loaded films an antibody response was observed to a pulsed waveform and it is from \nhere that the results described in this communication were developed.  Also it must be noted that \npotentiometric deposition protocols almost always resulted in electroactive films, whereas \ngalvanostatic protocols tended to give overoxidised films that were not electroactive, even though \nthe observed coverage of the sensor surface appeared to be more complete. This may be a \nfunction of the antibodies used, however, in most reports to date, pure antibodies have not been \nprepared (most commercial sources have other proteins added as stabilisers) and other \ncomponents such as nitrate ions have been included in the polymerisation matrix to enable \n 4\nelectroconductive, galvanostatically prepared films to be produced.  In this work only \npotentiostatically deposited films were used in the electrochemical interrogation experiments \ndescribed.  It has been reported by Yuan et al that overoxidised polypyrrole films containing \nK4[Fe(CN6)] and formate dehydrogenase + NAD were produced at potentials of 800mV over a \n20 minute period [8], thus the potential of 900mV used in these studies would clearly produce \nnon-conducting overoxidised films when deposition was carried out galvanostatically over the \ntimescales used.  \nAntibody-antigen interactions are by their very nature complex and the reproducible \nresponse characteristics of immunosensors requires that the affinity reaction occurring is \nminimally perturbed by the fabrication procedure.  It has been shown in our work here that \nantibodies may be successfully incorporated into conducting polymer films by entrapment in a \ngrowing polypyrrole film with no detrimental effect to antibody activity.   The process of \nimmunosensor manufacture is an important issue that is often overlooked and we have taken time \nto focus on the methods of immunosensor production, together with the use of 125I as a radiolabel \nto directly quantify the amount of antibody entrapped in the conducting films produced. The \nwhole sensor was counted, together with the appropriate controls to give a clear result of \nantibody incorporation. Similarly we have direct evidence that the binding of antigen to the \ncorresponding antibody occurs by using a tritium labelled antigen and incubating this with \nantibodies entrapped in conducting polypyrrole films. This part of the work was carried out using \nthe purer antibody preparation, anti-digoxin IgG to minimise interferences from extraneous \ncontaminants.   \nOur initial interrogation studies were based on the pulsed amperometry technique \ndescribed for the detection of human serum albumin [3] using both an anti-BSA and the anti-\ndigoxin immunosensors produced in the first part of the work and a Dionex PAD II detector.  \n 5\nThis technique was originally used for the measurement of carbohydrates via their amperometric \noxidation at the surface of either a gold or platinum electrode [9, 10].  \nSadik and Wallace adapted this pulsed amperometry methodology for the monitoring of \nantibody-antigen interactions on a polymer-modified electrode [3].  One of the main limitations \nto the development of an immunosensor is the large binding energy between the antibody and \nantigen, which in many instances give rise to interactions that are not readily reversible.  The \nfindings by Sadik and Wallace suggested, however, that by pulsing the potential between two \nsuitably chosen values, the surface of the working electrode could be regenerated and in this way \na sensor might be used for further measurements.  A Dionex PAD-II system was used for the \npolarisation of antibody-loaded polypyrrole films via a pulsed potential waveform, in conjunction \nwith a time-dependent current monitoring regime. It was reported that this technique produced a \ndirect immunosensor that could be used for multiple analyses with typical response times of less \nthan one minute [3, 11, 12].  \nWhile this work showed great promise we have found great difficulty in reproducing the \nresults reliably using both the anti-BSA and anti-digoxin immunosensors produced and \nencountered problems of day-to-day reproducibility of manufacture of individual sensors, as well \nas baseline instability of the sensors produced.   \nTo attempt to understand the source of these irreproducibilities, we also interrogated \nimmunosensors produced using anti-BSA IgG using a repeating polarising waveform in batch \nmode and collected the entire current transient using an oscilloscope.  The results obtained have \ndefinitively proved that a reproducible signal is contained within the current transient obtained \nand in this paper we have gone some way towards developing the reliability of the technique as \nan immunosensors format.  \n \n 6\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nChemicals and Reagents \nAll reagents were analytical grade unless otherwise stated.  Concentrated sulphuric acid \nwas purchased from Fisher Scientific UK (Leicestershire, UK). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), \npyrrole, sodium dichromate, platinum gauze, platinum foil, bovine anti-IgG and sheep anti-BSA \nantibodies were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. (Dorset, England). Anti-digoxin \nantibodies were purified using an affinity column technique according to the method described by \nGrant [13], to give an essentially pure preparation of lyophilised sheep anti-digoxin IgG.  Starting \nmaterial was immunised sheep serum kindly donated by Therapeutic Antibodies Ltd.  125I \nlabelled anti-digoxin IgG was prepared by Dr P. A. Milner, School of Biochemistry and \nMolecular Biology, University of Leeds, using the purified antibodies prepared previously. \nTritium labelled digoxin was obtained from New England Nuclear.  Screen-printed electrodes \nwere purchased from Gwent Electronics Materials Ltd.  Deionised water was obtained from a \nMillipore Milli-Q purification system.  \nApparatus \nSonication of cleansed platinum wire electrodes was performed using a Kerry Sonicator. \nA Thompson E Series Ministat potentiostat was used for deposition of antibody-polypyrrole films \nonto platinum wire. \nA wall-jet configuration flow cell was kindly donated by Professor Lo Gorton \n(Department of Analytical Chemistry, University of Lund), which consisted of a platinum wire \ncounter electrode, a Ag\/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum working electrode constructed \n\u201cin house\u201d.  A Gilson Minipulse 3 peristaltic pump, a Gallenkamp Datatrace chart recorder and \nan Anachem Ltd Universal Valve Switching Module Injection system were interfaced to the \nsystem. \n 7\nPolymerisation of pyrrole unlabelled immunosensors, was performed using a Sycopel \nAEW2 computer-controlled potentiostat that recorded all output parameters directly via software \nversion 1996-97.  The deposition protocol was carried out in a 3-electrode cell incorporating \nreference, working and auxiliary electrodes (Fig.1).  Labelled immunosensors were prepared in a \ncontrolled environment using the same deposition protocols, but an EG&G Model 362 manual \npotentiostat was used for electropolymerisation. \nA Dionex Pulsed Amperometric Detector-II (PAD-II) was linked to a Gallenkamp \nDatatrace Chart Recorder.  The Dionex PAD-II system operates as an integral potential square-\nwave generator, potentiostat and current data recorder.  Thus potential, E1 and E2 can be changed \nand in this way the square waveform defined, although the current was always recorded during \nthe last 20ms of E2 (Fig.3). \nPlatinum wires were inserted into a purpose-built plastic case (Fig.1).  A silicon seal was \ncreated around the platinum and a flush edge achieved using epoxy resin surrounding the \ncircumference of the protruding platinum wire.  A multi-core wire was soldered to the external \nend of the platinum wire to create a secure connection.  Injection of samples into the flow-cell \nsystem was accomplished using a Universal Valve Switching Module purchased by Anachem \nLtd. \n \nPreparation of Platinum Electrodes \nPlatinum wire was immersed in chromic acid (300\u00b5g sodium dichromate dissolved in 30 \nml concentrated sulphuric acid) for 10 minutes followed by a thorough rinsing in de-ionised \n(ELGA-Milli Q) water and sonication for 5 minutes in de-ionised water. \nPlanar platinum electrodes were used as supplied from Gwent Electronic Materials Ltd. \nand used directly from the packaging material to avoid contamination. \n \n 8\nPyrrole Purification. \nPyrrole was distilled twice under vacuum before use using a Quick Fit micro-distillation \napparatus in batches of approximately 10ml. After distillation the pyrrole was placed in a \ndarkened container and deoxygenated by bubbling nitrogen through the solution. Pyrrole was \nstored in a sealed container at -20 \u00b0C and was warmed to room temperature before use. \n \n \nPreparation of Polypyrrole\/Anti-BSA Solution \n       Anti-BSA solution was dialysed for 2 hours against ELGA water to remove low \nmolecular weight contaminants and then 200\u00b5l (equivalent to 480\u00b5g protein) was added to 5 ml \nof 0.5M pyrrole solution in ELGA water (173\u00b5l of distilled pyrrole into 5ml water) and stirred \ngently to fully disperse the reagents. \n \nPreparation of Polypyrrole\/Anti-digoxin Solution \n       Anti-digoxin \/ pyrrole solution used to prepare the platinum wire electrodes was \nprepared from 20mg anti-digoxin lyophilisate (10.4 mg protein the remainder NaCl) added to 5 \nml of 0.5M pyrrole solution in ELGA water (173\u00b5l of distilled pyrrole into 5ml water) and stirred \ngently to fully dissolve the reagents.   \nSolutions used to prepare planar platinum electrodes were prepared using the same \nprocedure but at a lower concentration of 100\u00b5g anti-digoxin per ml. Radio-labelled experiments \nusing anti-digoxin used this concentration and 1\u00b5g of 125I labelled anti-digoxin added to 3ml of \npyrrole \/ unlabelled anti-digoxin solution (300\u00b5g in total). In these experiments pyrrole \nconcentration was varied between 0.1M and 0.5M in 0.1M steps. \n \n 9\nDeposition of Antibody-Containing Polypyrrole Films onto Platinum Electrodes \nPolypyrrole films containing anti-BSA or anti-digoxin were deposited onto cleaned, \nplatinum wire electrodes previously described or planar platinum electrodes of 3.14mm2 working \narea using a potential of 900mV vs. Ag\/AgCl with a platinum gauze auxiliary electrode.  To \navoid contamination of the Ag\/AgCl reference electrode and any leakage of the reference \nelectrode electrolyte into the polymerisation formulations, a double junction reference electrode \nwas used in all polymerisation protocols, Fig.1. A deposition time of 10 minutes was employed \nas standard, however for the time course experiments 5, 10 and 15 minutes were evaluated.  After \ngrowth the electrode was washed in ELGA water three times to ensure a clean surface.  \nPotentiostatic deposition protocols were used to ensure the polypyrrole films produced remained \nelectroactive as it was previously known [8] and confirmed by us that galvanostatically produced \nfilms were often overoxidised and therefore non-electroactive when the antibodies described \nwere used.  Galvanostatically deposited films were prepared for comparative purposes using a \ncurrent density of 1mA cm-2. \n \nDetermination of calibration curve for 125I labelled anti-digoxin polypyrrole films. \nPyrrole (134\u00b5l) was mixed with 0.1M potassium chloride (100\u00b5l) and made up to 4ml \nwith Milli Q grade water and films were deposited at a constant potential of 950mV Vs Ag\/AgCl \n(Sat KCl) for 5 minutes. In total 18 films were grown by this method using 3 batches of the \nsolution just described. Various amounts of the 125I anti-digoxin were pipetted onto the surface of \nthe prepared pyrrole films and allowed to dry. The screen-printed electrodes were then counted \nfor 60 seconds in a Alloc 1470 Wizard Automatic gamma counter in the pre-described orientation \nand an appropriate calibration curve was constructed, Fig.3. Due to the relatively short half-life of \n56 days for the 125I isotope, this calibration curve was retained and recounted with every set of \nexperiments performed. \n 10\n Measurement of Digoxin \nDigoxin was dissolved in ELGA water with exhaustive stirring to give 100\u00b5g.L-1 stock \nsolutions.  Standard solutions were prepared to the desired concentrations from these stocks.  \nPlatinum working electrodes were placed into a 3-electrode, purpose built cell, through which \nanalytes and\/or buffer could be pumped by means of a peristaltic pump.  Diluent (ELGA water) \nwas passed through the cell at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1 for thirty minutes prior to each set of \nsample injections to allow a stable baseline to be established.  The Dionex PAD-II apparatus was \nconnected and 20\u00b5L samples were injected into the flow, still at 1 ml min-1.  The Dionex \napparatus was programmed to repetitively generate a pulsed potential starting at 0.0V vs. \nAg\/AgCl (for 60ms duration) before stepping to +0.7V for 540ms and then returning to 0.0V to \nbegin the next cycle.  This long pulse duration is a function of the Dionex design which is for \ncarbohydrate analysis [9, 10]. The current was then sampled repetitively during the last 20ms of \nE2 (+0.7V).  Output from the Dionex apparatus was monitored using a Gallenkamp Datatrace \nchart recorder.  \n \nData Capture for Total Current Transients \nFor interrogation of the whole waveform from the anti-BSA immunosensors, a Thurlby \nand Thander TG215 Function generator was used in conjunction with a Thompson E Series \nMinistat Potentiostat and the output monitored using Picoscope capture software. Comparable \nparameters to those created using the Dionex PAD-II apparatus were achieved, producing a \nwaveform between 0 and 0.7V vs Ag\/AgCl at a frequency of 10Hz (equivalent to a pulse width of \n50 ms) across a 3-electrode unstirred, batch type cell to remove any interferences from solution \nflow.  We are not trying to replicate the polarisation\/interrogation regime of the Dionex but rather \nare trying to understand and record the nature of a current transient following pulse polarisation \n 11\nof the system. These measurements cannot be directly compared to earlier FIA work [3] due to \nthe different sample introduction regime, but because this experiment gives rise to current \ntransients related to analyte (antigen) concentration in a repeatable manner, the implication is still \nthe same that the antibody-antigen reaction appears to be reversible in nature. \n \nAnalytical Protocol \nThe platinum working electrode, Ag\/AgCl reference electrode and platinum gauze \ncounter electrode were placed into a small glass vessel and covered with purified ELGA water (5 \nml). The working electrode was repeatedly polarised by means of the staircase waveform for \nthree minutes to establish a baseline.  The water was then replaced with 5 ml of a known \nconcentration of BSA sample and the pulsed waveform monitored for 3 minutes.  The cell was \nwashed three times with water before re-establishing a baseline for the next determination. BSA \nconcentrations ranged from 0 to 100ppm with multiple current transients being recorded per \nconcentration and for varying time intervals. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nAntibody Loading of Polypyrrole Films \n Direct incorporation of anti-digoxin antibodies into growing polypyrrole films has been \ndemonstrated using 125I labelled anti-digoxin added to the polymerisation solution before \ndeposition.  Increasing the concentration of pyrrole in the polymerisation solution has a small \neffect on the amount of anti-digoxin incorporated into the film, with higher concentrations giving \nmore consistent and even films on visual observation, which is an indicator of better film-to-film \nreproducibility.  Increasing the polymerisation time from 5 minutes up to 15 minutes also \ninfluenced the overall amount of anti-digoxin incorporated. \n 12\nThe results are summarised in Fig.4.  Based on these results and the fact that a higher pyrrole \nconcentration gave more even coverage of the planar platinum electrodes used, a concentration of \n0.5M pyrrole, with a polymerisation time of 10 minutes was used throughout the remainder of the \nwork. The same charge was consumed during galvanostatic and potentiostatic growth as \nconfirmed by charge integration techniques for films containing both antibody and the chloride \ncontrols. \nDuring polymerisation the anti-digoxin is entrapped into the growing film to give an \naffinity surface as evidenced by the selective affinity reaction between the anti-digoxin entrapped \nand the radiolabelled digoxin shown in Fig.5.  The incorporation of a non-selective bovine anti-\nIgG as a control gave virtually no counts in each of the pyrrole concentrations tested, clearly \nshowing non-specific binding of the labelled digoxin was minimal.  The anti-digoxin results \nshown in Fig.5 are averages of triplicate films produced at each concentration of pyrrole. It is \nclear that the anti-digoxin incorporated into the growing polypyrrole films is immuno-active and \navailable for antigen binding events to occur at the surface of the deposited films. Scanning \nelectron microscopy of prepared films indicated that the planar platinum electrodes displayed \nsurface roughness yet deposition by potentiostatic protocols covered the platinum surface with a \nthin layer of polypyrrole incorporating entrapped antibody. Galvanostatic protocols gave films \nthat appeared thicker, but as described previously often these were non-electroactive and \ntherefore useless as immunosensors. Films prepared using chloride as a counter ion were much \nthicker in nature and had a different morphology.  Electron micrographs of the deposited films \nare shown in Fig.6. \n \nAntigen Detection Using DC Pulsed Amperometry \nAttempts have been made by other workers to repeat the work of Sadik and Wallace [3], \nhowever great difficulty has been experienced in attaining reproducible results [7]. There have, \n 13\nhowever, been several reports in the literature of the technique being successfully exploited by \nthe same authors e.g. for the detection of human serum albumin [3], p-cresol [4], Thaumatin [5] \nand polychlorinated biphenyls [6].  The authors have informed us that the majority of these \nresults were obtained using one particular Dionex PAD-II machine (personal communication \nProf G G Wallace 1999).  It appears that attempts to transfer the technique across to a nominally \nsimilar machine of identical type and model have been only partially successful and in most other \ncases, where the same type of electrochemical interrogation techniques have been used, other \nacademic groups have not been able to reproduce the results reported.  Direct discussions with \nDionex (Technical Support Dept, 1999) revealed that differing machines that \u201cappear to be \nidentical\u201d do in fact monitor current at different relative timings within the pulsing cycle, even if \nthey are set at what should be identical sampling according to the control dials on each individual \nmachine.  We later determined this, as will be described in forthcoming discussions, to be one \nsource of the discrepancies reported by different groups [7].  \nFig.7a shows representative chronoamperometric current transients in response to \ninjection of a 1mg.l-1 digoxin sample into the flow cell containing an anti-digoxin antibody \nimmunosensor, giving rise to peak currents of ~20nA.  Addition of differing concentrations of \ndigoxin to the same type of electrode produced on a different day but with exactly the same \ndeposition parameters, Fig.7b gave one series of peaks that indicated a concentration dependant \nresponse. The baseline drift can be clearly seen and the signal response to the same concentration \nof digoxin is different between the different electrodes addressed. These two series of responses \nwere the only ones clearly observed using the Dionex PAD II system, therefore it was concluded \nthat the Dionex interrogation of antibody loaded sensors was insufficiently reliable for \nimmunosensors interrogation. \nIn both cases, injections of distilled water gave no signal, which tended to indicate that the \nsignal was due to the antibody response to the digoxin injected. These responses were only \n 14\nobserved on a sporadic basis however, as 1) the baseline tended to drift erratically and could not \nbe compensated for and 2) the responses were irregular and non-reproducible as can be seen for \nthe differential responses for 1mg.l-1 digoxin in Figs 7a and 7b.  No clear results were observed \nfrom the anti-BSA immunosensors using this form of immunosensor interrogation.  Clearly the \nmethod was unsuitable as an analytical technique, however on a positive note there was some sort \nof signal generation occurring. \n \nDetection of BSA Using Current Transient Analysis \nWith the understanding of the Dionex sampling regimen, and with the current transients \noccurring at slightly different relative timings depending on the machine being used, experiments \nwere conducted to pulse the immunosensor surface and then to record the whole current transient \nresponse.  Due to easier availability of anti-BSA the development of a usable analytical protocol \nwas aimed towards anti-BSa immunosensors. \nAs described within the experimental section, the antibody-containing films were \npotentiostatically pulsed at a frequency of 10Hz from 0 to 0.7 V vs Ag\/AgCl and the current \noutput for the entire waveform recorded using a Thompson E Series Ministat Potentiostat in \nconjunction with Picoscope capture software.  At the beginning of each polarisation, not the end \nof the pulse, the observed current curve was shown to rapidly rise to a maximum which decayed \n(Fig. 8a). The greatest consistency in the output from successive peak to peak was found to be at \nthe initiation of the pulse, with the output just before the pulse was terminated being rather \nirreproducible. Using this initial current response, a BSA calibration curve was constructed by the \nmeasurement of the initial peak currents from the current transients traces, Fig.8b.  The \ncalibration profile showed near-linear behaviour between 0 and 50ppm BSA (r2=0.996), at which \npoint the curve started to tend towards a plateau.  The original baseline was always re-established \nupon washing of the electrode with deionised water between samples. The calibration curve \n 15\nconstructed was from a single anti-BSA electrode that was washed successively between BSA \nadditions and which remained connected to the signal generator at all times during the \nexperiment, i.e. the surface was continually pulsed.  \nThe technique of constantly pulsing films has been used by other workers. They found \nthat resultant signals were more easily interrogated at shorter time-scales following pulsing in \nagreement with our findings [14,15]. \nThe results obtained were very clear in comparison to the Dionex interrogation of the \nimmunosensors and in control experiments performed using anti-BSA loaded films; distilled \nwater additions did not produce any change in the current observed, and therefore the evidence is \nthat the current transients observed are due to an interaction of the anti-BSA in the \nimmunosensors with the BSA solution added  [11,12].  Also it must be noted that the differing \nconcentrations of BSA used were not introduced to the immunosensor surface sequentially, but \non a random basis to ensure the responses recorded did not result from an attenuation of the \nsensor surface.  Samples were measured on ten electrodes with multiple injections (minimum 4 \nper sample) over several days. In all cases the response profiles were found to be reproducible, \ndisplaying a maximum standard deviation of 5 pA (5 x 10-3 nA). \nThe reversibility of the sensor in generating the reproducible responses to each of the \nBSA concentrations introduced has clearly been demonstrated in this case, (minimum 4 repeats \nfor each sensor). Ten sensors were used and the spread of data is shown by the error bars in \nFig.8b, and correspond to a maximum standard deviation of 0.5.   This is consistent with the \nearlier reports where reversibility was observed and multiple assays could be carried out on a \nsingle immunosensors.  \nControl experiments in which BSA samples were exposed to antibody-free polypyrrole \nfilms, made with chloride doped polypyrrole showed no increase or change in current output, \nconfirming that the currents observed were due in some way to the antibody-antigen interaction \n 16\n[11, 12].  In each case the reported results corresponded to peak currents, observed immediately \nfollowing the beginning of a polarisation pulse for the first five pulses.  This approach of \ncapturing the entire current transient proved significant in furthering our understanding towards \nattaining reliable and reproducible interrogation into these effects. \nThis approach contrasted significantly with the method of the Dionex PAD-II system \nwithin our laboratory, which sampled the current 520ms after the initial polarisation of the \nsurface.  Since the current transients tend rapidly towards a plateau at this point, monitoring a \nfaradaic reaction generated by the antibody and antigen would prove to be difficult, indeed it can \nbe shown that the interaction giving rise to this effect occurs over a time scale of a few tens to \nhundreds of milliseconds. To further complicate matters we subsequently determined from \nDionex that apparently similar machines manufactured at different times actually monitor current \nat slightly different relative times during the timespan of a pulse and we believe in the main, that \nthis accounts why different groups have previously obtained widely differing results from \napparently identical instrumentation. In essence each machine is internally calibrated to be \naccurate but different machines are not absolutely electronically identical with each other, \ntherefore the settings that are set on one machine may be subtly different from another set on the \nsupposed same settings, leading to the incorrect interrogation of identical immunosensor surfaces.  \nIt should be realised in this context that the Dionex instrument was produced for the measurement \nof steady state current for the determination of carbohydrates and other oxidisable analytes and \nfor this purpose such relative timing differences are irrelevant - even though they prove critical to \nwork involving antibody loaded polypyrrole films. \nThe actual source of the signal is as yet unclear, but it has been observed that the \npolypyrrole matrix has to be electroconductive for a signal to be observed.  Non-conductive, \noveroxidised matrices give no measurable responses on addition of antigen. This would indicate \nthat the actual signal generation is linked to the matrix, rather than a direct product of the \n 17\nantibody \u2013 antigen interaction alone and further work into the mechanism of signal generation \nwill be reported in a future publication. \nIn summary, BSA has been shown to bind reversibly and measurably to antibody \nmodified electrodes and gave excellent calibration profiles over a working concentration range of \n0-50 mg.l-1, so demonstrating the principle of antibody - and indeed practical significance behind \nthis approach for a novel electrochemical immunosensor format. \n 18\n CONCLUSIONS \nWe have definitively proved incorporation of antibody into growing polypyrrole films and \nthat such antibodies retain affinity properties for their antigens using radiolabelled probes.      \nNon-specific adsorption of the radiolabelled probes has been found to be extremely low.  \nPotentiometrically deposited films were more often electroactive than galvanostatically deposited \nfilms, and retention of the electroactivity of the films was necessary to observe any signal \ngeneration. \nWe have determined that subtle differences in the commercial Dionex machines are most \nlikely responsible for the variability of results reported in the literature for different antibody \u2013\npolypyrrole electrode systems. A methodology based upon the captivity and interrogation of \ncurrent transients upon square waveform potential excitation has allowed for a novel generic \napproach for a reversible immuno-electrochemical sensor regime. Demonstration of this approach \nhas been initially shown by the fabrication of an anti-Bovine Serine Albumin \u2013 polypyrrole   \nmodified platinum electrode based sensor with a practical working concentration range of 0-100 \nmg.l-1 BSA, and which showed a linearity of r2=0.966 over a 0-50 mg.l-1 concentration range.  \nReversibility of the antibody \u2013 antigen interaction has be demonstrated using a single \nimmunosensor continuously pulsed at a frequency of 10Hz, between 0.0V and  +0.7V vs \nAg\/AgCl. \n 19\n ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nWe wish to thank the EPSRC for a studentship for S.
