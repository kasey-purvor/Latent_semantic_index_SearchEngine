His air pressure data have been studied in detail, \nthrough comparisons to information from other UK stations, and via investigation of the \nsea level response to air pressure change as observed in his own tidal measurements. A \nfirst attempt has been made to construct a Liverpool air pressure time series spanning \n1768-1999, by means of combination of Hutchinson\u2019s data with later information from \nthe Liverpool docks and Bidston Observatory. \n \n 2\n1. Introduction \n \nWilliam Hutchinson was born near Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1716, and rose from being a \ncommon sailor to the command of a privateer during the first part of the Seven Years \nWar (1756-1763). He was appointed Dockmaster and Water Bailiff at Liverpool in 1759. \nHe managed to combine these demanding positions with an extensive set of other \nactivities. At various times he was an inventor, author, civic leader, philanthropist, trader \nand, what we would now call, scientific researcher. Anyone wanting to know more about \nthis remarkable person can do no better than read his own publications (Hutchinson, \n1777, 1791).  \n \nThe research for which Hutchinson is most well-known is his compilation of data sets of \ntidal and meteorological information spanning almost 30 years. He measured the height \nand time of almost every Liverpool high water between 1764-1793, providing the UK\u2019s \nfirst record of long term sea level variability (Woodworth, 1999a,b; Woodworth and \nBlackman, 2002). The first four years of data were given to Richard and George Holden \nto produce some of the first publicly-accessible high water prediction tables (Woodworth, \n2002) and are now lost. However, two copies of the remaining information were \npreserved safely in Liverpool libraries. \n \nThe high water data have been inspected by a number of tidal specialists through the \nyears (e.g. Lubbock, 1836), with general agreement that the measurements are of good \nquality. However, Hutchinson was obviously a busy man and he left no detailed \ndescriptions of how he worked. Therefore, a possibility needs investigating that the \nmeasurements (made twice a day for almost three decades at all times of day and night \nand in all weathers) might not be as good as one might believe. More recent quality \ncontrol checks have confirmed that the tidal data are as good as we might hope \n(Woodworth, 1999a). However, it is impossible to apply the most sensitive test of all, \ncomparison to data acquired over the same period (and ideally by the same method) from \na nearby station. \n \n 3\nAnother way of forming an impression of the likely quality of the tidal measurements is \nto make use of Hutchinson\u2019s meteorological data. Over the same period, he collected a \nnear-complete set of information on air pressure and temperature, rainfall and wind speed \nand direction, using instruments in, or on the roof of, his four-storey house situated close \nto the Liverpool Old Dock (adjacent to the present-day Albert Dock estate). Some of \nthese meteorological data have been used by previous authors and found to be of good (or \nat least reasonable) quality. For example, the air temperature data were used in the \nconstruction of the Lancashire and Central England records (Manley, 1946, 1953, 1974), \nand the rainfall data were employed in a UK regional time series (Craddock, 1976). \nConsequently, if one can form an assessment of the quality of Hutchinson\u2019s \nmeteorological data, and therefore of how good a weather observer he was, then one can \nform an indirect impression of how good a tidal observer he might have been.  \n \nThe air pressure data are particularly important in that they can provide a direct, rather \nthan an indirect, assessment of the quality of the tidal data. Sea levels along the west \ncoast of England are known to have an approximate \u2018inverse barometer\u2019 response to \nchanges in air pressure (e.g. Thompson, 1980). Therefore, a test of the quality of both the \ntidal and air pressure information is to see how well the anticipated response manifests \nitself in his data. \n \nAn assessment of Hutchinson\u2019s ability to make meteorological and tidal measurements \nwas the main objective of the study. A second important objective was to employ his air \npressure data in the construction of a near-continuous time series of Liverpool air \npressure from 1768. While air pressure records of similar length are available from \nLondon, Edinburgh and Dublin (Figure 1), there are no comparable records from NW \nEngland. A Liverpool air pressure record spanning almost two and half centuries would \nbe a major addition to the set of long European time series, which, when used in \ncombination, provide insight into the magnitudes and timescales of variability in the \nEuropean atmospheric circulation (Kington, 1980; Jones et al., 1999; Slonosky et al., \n1999, 2000, 2001).  \n \n 4\nA third important objective was to assemble as much of Hutchinson\u2019s meteorological \ndata as possible in computer-accessible form. This will enable any future researcher to \nmake ready use of the data sets, without the need to consult either the original tabulations \n(permission for which has to be obtained from Liverpool Local Studies and Public \nRecord Office) or the microfilmed copies of the tabulations (Woodworth, 2000). All \ncomputer data sets can be obtained through the British Oceanographic Data Centre \n(http:\/\/www.bodc.ac.uk). \n \n2. Hutchinson\u2019s Tabulations \n \nThe original Hutchinson tabulations (sometimes known inappropriately as his \u2018Journals\u2019) \nconsist of four bound volumes, for 1768-1772, 1773-1779, 1780-1786 and 1787-August \n1793. The first volume shows evidence for sheets having been cut out, and it is possible \nthat it contained the now missing data for 1764-1767.  \n \nThe layout of the information for each month is essentially the same throughout with \nminor variations (see Woodworth, 2000 for full details). In 1768, the journals contained \ntabulations of: \n \n\u2022 Day number and day of the week \n\u2022 Lunar information including Age of the Moon (i.e. days since New \nMoon), lunar distance in miles, declination and southing. These will have \nbeen abstracted from a nautical almanac. \n\u2022 Morning (with its usual meaning of midnight to noon) time of high water \n(hour and minutes). \u2018Time\u2019 here means apparent solar time (as measured \nby a sun dial). \n\u2022 Morning height of high water (feet and inches) \n\u2022 Wind direction measured from the true meridian and speed measured on a \nscale of 1-60 miles per hour \u2018according to Mr Smeaton\u2019s rules\u2019. \n\u2022 Weather conditions \n\u2022 Evening time and height of high water, wind direction and speed and \n 5\nweather conditions. \n\u2022 Tides daily difference (hours and minutes). These appear to be sometimes \nthe differences between consecutive morning tides, and sometimes \nbetween consecutive evening tides. In any case, this information is \nredundant as the times of the individual tides are recorded. \n\u2022 Height of the barometer in inches of mercury. \n\u2022 Height of the thermometer in degrees Fahrenheit.  The thermometer kept \nin doors, at the head of a staircase four stories high. \n \nIn August 1769, the barometer and thermometer information was moved to the middle of \nthe page and clearly labelled as \u2018Noon\u2019. From June 1774, the noon entries acquired an \nextra column for \u2018Rain in 1\/8ths\u2019 (i.e. eighths of an inch as measured by a rain gauge, \npresumably for the 24 hours up to noon) and usually the total for each month was shown \nat the bottom of the page. At the end of each December, the total amount of rain for the \nyear was stated and confirmation given that the measurements were made \u2018from the top \nof my house about 41 feet above high water mark\u2019. \n \nA manuscript copy of the tabulations was made in 1814 by J. Lang, a local printer, and \nhas been preserved in good condition in the Liverpool Athenaeum Library. The \ninformation in the copy is essentially the same as in the original, but in certain places it is \neasier to read. Microfilmed copies of the tabulations contain images of both versions \n(Woodworth, 2000). \n \nThe computer data sets constructed in the present project were made by inspection of the \nmicrofilm copies. The images of the original tabulations were naturally the primary \nreference, but the Lang images were consulted when the need arose (e.g. when the \nhandwriting in the originals was unclear). All air pressure, air temperature and rainfall \nvalues were double (and sometimes treble) checked. Computer data sets of morning and \nevening wind speed and direction, and Hutchinson\u2019s brief descriptions of morning and \nevening weather conditions, have also been assembled but have so far not been studied in \ndetail. The wind measurements were made \u201caccording to Mr Smeaton's rules\u201d. However, \n 6\nwind measurements in ports and towns are prone to many difficulties, even today, and \none suspects that Hutchinson\u2019s wind data are less useful than his other tabulations, a fact \nwhich was recognised at an early stage (e.g. see pp.601-607 of Garnett, 1796). \n \n3. Remarks on Each Parameter \n \n3.1 Air Temperature \n \nHutchinson\u2019s first set of temperature measurements were made at noon only, but from 26 \nJanuary 1778 he started to record at both 8 am and noon. There are many mentions in the \ntabulations of thermometers being \u2018broken\u2019 or \u2018out of order\u2019, and for the last 8 months of \n1770 there were no temperature measurements at all. This suggests that systematic errors \nin the time series could be important. Computer data sets have been made of all \ntemperature information but only the noon data have been inspected in detail. There is \nclear bias in the noon temperatures (tabulated in degrees Fahrenheit) towards even \nvalues, approximately twice as many even values being recorded than odd values. \nIdiosyncratic features of this kind also exist in Hutchinson\u2019s tidal data (Woodworth, \n1999a). \n \nBefore the 17 January 1777 entry, a mark \u2018O.D.\u2019 in the tabulations denotes (one assumes) \n'Out Doors'. This mark does not appear in the Lang copy, so there is some doubt as to \nwhether it was made by Hutchinson himself. (Manley, 1946 gives this date as a day \nearlier.) Up to that date, Hutchinson had made use of a thermometer at the top of the \nstairs leading to the roof of his house. The outdoor measurements were made \u201cunder a \ntable (to prevent the rain having any effect), facing the north, in an open observatory, as \nmuch exposed to the open air as possible\u201d (Garnett, 1796). Garnett states that this \ninformation was extracted from Hutchinson\u2019s Journals, but such a statement about the \nobservatory cannot be found in the surviving copies.  \n \nFigure 2 shows the time series of monthly mean noon air temperatures obtained from \nHutchinson\u2019s measurements. The seasonal cycle is quite evident but with a smaller \n 7\namplitude prior to 1777. As one might expect, the monthly mean summer temperatures \nrecorded in-doors and out-doors were comparable, whereas monthly mean winter \ntemperatures obtained inside the house were approximately 10 degrees higher than those \nobtained outside. \n \nManley (1946, 1953) discussed the curious 18th century practice of making air \ntemperature measurements \u201cin a shady room without fire\u201d as recommended by Jurin \n(1723), or, as in Hutchinson\u2019s case, at the top of a house. Consequently, Hutchinson can \nhardly be blamed for following in his earlier years what had been accepted procedure. In \nspite of the biases, Manley was able to incorporate useful information from Hutchinson\u2019s \ndata within his Lancashire and Central England temperature time series (Manley, 1946, \n1953). \n \n3.2 Air Pressure \n \n3.2.1 Construction of an Adjusted Time Series \n \nHutchinson (1777) refers to a Tampion (sic, i.e. Tompion, the first maker of Hooke\u2019s \nwheel barometer and many other instruments) portable barometer which he had used \nduring his time at sea.1 However, the records provide no information on what kind of \nbarometer was used at his house in Liverpool. One assumes it to have been some kind of \nwheel or cistern barometer, both of which were in common use at the time. The standard \ninstruments of the day would have been prone to many problems (e.g. presence of \ntrapped air in the mercury column) and effective long-term calibration would have been \ndifficult if not impossible (Middleton, 1964). Nevertheless, one would have expected air \npressure to have been one of the more robust of the meteorological parameters recorded \nby Hutchinson.  \n \n                                                 \n1 This would have been a good instrument for the time (Anita McConnell, private communication. See \nMcConnell, 2005 for a history of the marine barometer). \n 8\nHowever, on transferring the data into computer form, it immediately became apparent \nthat there were a number of problems. A problem in the first six months is that \nHutchinson noted air pressure to only 1\/10 inch (approximately 3 mbar) which is a \ncoarser resolution than one would like for time series analysis. On 16 June 1768 he \u2018left \ntown to go for London', which coincided with a change to include an extra decimal place \n(approximately 0.3 mbar), which became the standard for the rest of the record. However, \nat times towards the end of the record (e.g. in June 1791), even though the pressures are \nexpressed to two decimal places, rounding to one decimal place again seems to have \ntaken place. \n \nA second problem became apparent when monthly mean pressures were compared to \ndata from Edinburgh and London (Jones et al., 1999). These records start in 1770 and \n1774 respectively and end in 1995, and are assumed to contain mean sea level pressures \n(MSLP) throughout. Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of Hutchinson and Edinburgh monthly \nmean pressures, indicating three main sections of data: \n \n1: From January 1770 \u2013 December 1780 and December 1789 \u2013 August 1793, when \nEdinburgh minus Hutchinson pressure (\u0394P) was approximately 1.7 mbar (using \narithmetic average pressure differences, median pressure difference also being 1.7 mbar). \n \n2: August 1787 \u2013 November 1789, when \u0394P was approximately 15.5 mbar (or 15.8 mbar \nmedian pressure difference). \n  \n3: January 1781 - July 1787, when \u0394P was approximately 6.0 mbar (or 5.3 mbar median \npressure difference). \n \nThe beginning and end of each section of data was estimated partly by inspection of the \ntime series of \u0394P (and the corresponding pressure-difference series using London data) \nand partly from knowledge of possible problems with the Hutchinson barometer. For \nexample, on 26 July 1787 the tabulations state that the barometer is \u2018out of order\u2019, and \nthere is a gap until measurements recommenced on 4 August. Therefore, it seems likely \n 9\nthat whatever changes were made at the beginning of August (perhaps a change of \ninstrument) introduced a systematic shift. On the other hand, there are no \u2018out of order\u2019 \nstatements towards the end of 1780 which would explain precisely when and why a shift \nhad occurred. The years 1779 and 1780 contain many unexplained data gaps which could \nbe alternative choices for the time of the shift, instead of the end of 1780 chosen. \nInspection of the \u0394P series (and the corresponding series using London pressure data) \ndoes not provide a definite conclusion. The shift towards the end of 1789 seems clear \nfrom the \u0394P series but there are no data gaps at all in 1789, and then not until March \n1790, and no informative remarks. Inter-comparison of time series shows that a small \nnumber of additional outliers exist in each section of the Hutchinson data, and are also \npresent in the Edinburgh and London records.   \n \nAn \u2018adjusted\u2019 Hutchinson air pressure data set was constructed by applying the above \u0394P \n(arithmetic average) offsets to the three sections of data, such that Liverpool and \nEdinburgh air pressures were on average the same for 1770-1793. The resulting \ncorrelation coefficients between monthly means for the adjusted Hutchinson record and \nEdinburgh and London are 0.817 and 0.830 respectively. The high value for the latter is \nparticularly gratifying as it provides an independent check on the adjustment. The \ncorrelation coefficient between Edinburgh and London monthly means in the same period \nis slightly lower at 0.691, which is partly explainable by the further distance apart. \n \nNo Edinburgh or London data exist for 1768-1769. Consequently, a comparison for these \nearlier years is not possible. Their \u2018adjusted\u2019 data were computed using the offset of \nsection 1. The resulting time series of adjusted annual mean air pressures (defined as the \naverage of the available monthly values for each year) for the entire Hutchinson record, \nand for Edinburgh and London, are shown in Figure 4. The low value in the first year is \nalmost certainly an artifact of pressures being recorded to only 1\/10 inch. Correlations \nbetween the adjusted series and Edinburgh and London yield coefficients of 0.662 and \n0.605 respectively, which are lower than the coefficients from the monthly means. In \naddition, the root-mean-square (rms) of the adjusted annual means is approximately 25% \nlarger than those for the other two sites for the years in common (which does not include \n 10\nthe suspect year of 1768). This suggests (among other possibilities) the difficulty \nHutchinson may have had of maintaining the accuracy of the pressure measurements over \nmany years; this issue will be returned to below. \n \nNone of a long set of corrections has been made to the Hutchinson pressure data. \nHowever, it is important to list them, to demonstrate that they have not been forgotten \nand to estimate their importance. In principle, a temperature correction could be applied \nto some of the pressures as noon temperature data exist. One can assume that the \nbarometer was located in-doors, the seasonal temperature variation of which was \napproximately \u00b1 10 \u00b0F or 5 \u00b0C (first part of the time series in Figure 2).  That would \nresult in a seasonal correction to the pressure of approximately \u00b1 1 mbar (Diem, 1962; \nMiddleton, 1964; Slonosky et al., 2001). However, the correction could not be applied \nsystematically on a daily basis for the second part of the time series when the temperature \nmeasurements were out-doors; one would be forced to resort to the use of average in-door \nseasonal temperatures. It was decided that corrections for temperature fluctuations were \nadequately small for present purposes and they have not been applied. An overall \npressure correction for mean temperature has also been omitted, given that the \nHutchinson pressure data were adjusted to the Edinburgh information (and in turn will be \n\u2018re-adjusted\u2019 to a combination of Edinburgh, London and Bidston information below). A \nfurther set of corrections, such as scale errors and capillarity, which are dependent on the \nparticular instrument used, should also be made (Middleton, 1964; Slonosky et al., 2001). \nHowever, as mentioned above, information on the instrument is not available. A \ncorrection for the height of the barometer above mean sea level would normally be \napplied to convert station pressure to MSLP. If the barometer was about 41 feet above \nhigh water, or approximately 20 m above mean sea level, then the correction would be \naround 2 mbar. However, as in the case of the overall pressure correction for mean \ntemperature, it was unnecessary to consider this time-independent term in the present \nanalysis. \n \nA final consideration concerns bias in the Hutchinson data due to sampling air pressures \nonly at noon, rather than the several times a day sampling used for most of the later \n 11\nMSLP records. Again, this is largely a constant, rather than a time-dependent, bias. It can \nbe estimated from knowledge of the worldwide distribution of solar diurnal and semi-\ndiurnal atmospheric tides (Chapman and Lindzen, 1970; Dai and Wang, 1999), or \nempirically from local high-frequency (e.g. hourly) air pressure measurements over many \nyears. From both sets of information we conclude that such an MSLP noon bias would be \nof the order of several 1\/10 mbar, which is less than, or comparable to, the measurement \nprecision. \n \nOne concludes that, even though the Hutchinson pressure record contains a number of \nsystematic shifts, the time series in between them appears to be well-measured, even \nwithout applying temperature and other corrections. Furthermore, it is possible to identify \nthe major shifts and to adjust the record for them (with greater confidence for sections 1 \nand 3 than 2, as reflected in the differences between average and median \u0394P for each \nsection). Even though one would like to know more about why the shifts occurred (e.g. if \nthere was a change in recording position or instrument), and even though this somewhat \nad hoc \u2018adjustment\u2019 procedure is not perfect (as discussed further below), it is gratifying \nthat the resulting \u2018adjusted\u2019 time series is as good as it is, comparing well to both the \nEdinburgh and London records. From this evidence, one can recognize the care that \nHutchinson must have taken in his routine recording. \n \n3.2.2 Quality Assessment via the Inverse Barometer \n \nHutchinson (1777) observed A... Notwithstanding gales of winds affect the tides, I \nobserve it is more in the height than in the time ...@. This statement is correct: the ocean \ntide at Liverpool has such a large amplitude that the weather (winds and air pressure \nchanges resulting in storm surges) has very little effect on the time of high and low tide. \nHowever, storm surges can modify significantly the height of the tide. \n \nHe also stated: A... I cannot perceive, as has been imagined, that the tides are affected ... \nby the different weight of our atmosphere, as shewn by the barometer ...@. This statement \nis incorrect, sea level changes along the west coast of England being to a great extent an \n 12\n\u2018inverse barometer\u2019 (IB), whereby sea level is depressed (raised) by approximately 1 cm \ngiven an increase (decrease) of 1 mbar in air pressure. \n \nThe discovery of the >IB effect= is often credited to Sir James Clark Ross (1854) based on \nobservations at Port Leopold, Canada in 1848-49. However, analysis of Hutchinson\u2019s \ndata by Lubbock (1836), and also work by Daussy using data from Brest, had already \ndemonstrated the effect many years previously, as Ross acknowledged in a postscript to \nhis paper. The Swedish scientist Nils Gissler has also been credited with an early \nobservation of the effect (Roden and Rossby, 1999). \nFor the purpose of the present study, the IB effect offers a means by which Hutchinson\u2019s \ntidal and air pressure data can be validated. If one or both data sets were to be of poor \nquality, then the tidal and air pressure monthly mean time series would show low or no \ncorrelation. On the other hand, if both data sets were acceptable and if the IB effect was a \ngood representation of the local sea level response to air pressure change, then there \nwould be a high negative correlation between the two series and a linear regression, using \nair pressure as the independent variable, would yield a regression coefficient of \napproximately -1 cm\/mbar. At some locations, the effects of winds and other \nmeteorological and oceanographic factors can result in different coefficients. However, a \nclose approximation of the IB response is known to be valid for the west coast of England \nat monthly time scales (Thompson, 1980).   \nFigure 5 shows time series of monthly mean air pressure (adjusted as described above) \nand Mean High Water (MHW), the latter computed from Hutchinson\u2019s tabulations \n(Woodworth, 1999a,b). Each time series has been deseasonalised by removing its average \nseasonal cycle (defined so as to have zero mean), and an additional lunar nodal (18.61 \nyear) term has been removed from the MHW time series. The latter has an amplitude of \n11.0 cm with maximum values at times determined by the lunar equilibrium tide (i.e. \n1773.8 and 1792.4) (Woodworth, 1999a). (A significant corresponding lunar term will \nnot exist in an air pressure record. However, the record could contain energy at nodal \nperiod from other sources of atmospheric variability. Such a \u2018nodal\u2019 fit to the Hutchinson \ndata yielded an amplitude of 1.5 mbar.) \n 13\n \nIf MHW responded to air pressure as suggested by the IB effect, and if the IB effect was \nthe only process which resulted in MHW change, then the rms of the two series would be \nsimilar (MHW and air pressure measured in cm and mbar respectively). In fact, one sees \nthat rms air pressure is smaller than that of MHW (5.4 mbar compared to 8.2 cm) and the \ncorrelation between the two series is -0.590 instead of -1. This can be easily accounted \nfor by a realisation that it is far harder to measure variability in ocean level than in \nbarometer level, that there are other oceanographic processes than the IB effect that \ncontribute to MHW change, and, to a lesser extent considering the timescales of air \npressure and non-tidal sea level change, that the air pressures were recorded at noon and \nnot at the times of high water. In spite of the additional \u2018noise\u2019 in the MHW series, a \nregression analysis between the two yields a coefficient of -0.891 \u00b1 0.072 cm\/mbar, \nconsistent with previous studies of monthly sea level change on the west coast of England \n(Thompson, 1980). The residuals of the regression have an approximately normal \ndistribution. However, an exception to the generally good correspondence between \nparameters is evident in the first year of Figure 5 (1768), consistent with the concerns \nover the precision of the air pressure measurements at this time as demonstrated in Figure \n4. Removal of that year from the analysis modifies the coefficient to -0.897 \u00b1 0.074 \ncm\/mbar. (Removal of the \u2018nodal\u2019 component of air pressure, as described above, \nmodifies the coefficient by only 0.02 cm\/mbar.)  \n \nAn experiment was conducted in which the monthly MHW measurements were replaced \nby monthly MHW values computed using Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory tidal \nprediction software. This MHW time series contains signals of tidal origin only, and does \nnot contain a predicted sea level response to air pressure. Seasonal and nodal components \nwere removed as before. The correlation coefficient between that residual series and the \nmeasured monthly air pressures was found to be -0.053, which is consistent with zero \ncorrelation as expected. This altogether provides a confirmation that genuine air pressure \neffects are indeed reflected in the measured MHW values.   \n \n 14\nOne concludes that the Hutchinson adjusted air pressure and MHW time series must both \nbe of generally good quality, otherwise the anticipated IB correlation coefficient would \nnot have been obtained. Therefore, Hutchinson must have been a good observer of both \nparameters. \n \n3.3 Rainfall \n \nHutchinson began his rainfall measurements in June 1774 using a rain-gauge \u2018on the roof \nof my house 41 foot above the highest water mark\u2019. When away from home, rain totals \nwere accumulated into a value shown on the day of return. As a result, some rainfall will \nbe included in the total for the following month. The rain column often indicates \u2018snow\u2019; \nthose days were treated as having no rain. Sometimes, Hutchinson showed a series of \ndays of snow with the words 'snow accumulated to' followed by a rain value; that amount \nwas treated as if it had been ordinary rain. The Hutchinson snow remarks were not \nconsistent from year to year, and individual winter monthly totals may have been \nmisrepresented to some extent. However, Liverpool tends to experience limited periods \nof snow, and one would expect the reported annual rainfall totals to be affected by only a \nsmall amount. \n \nA monthly rainfall total was defined, provided that at least 20 days had a rain record. Any \ngaps in the month were then accounted for by scaling up the recorded total by the number \nof days in the month. Figure 6 shows the resulting monthly mean rainfall totals in the \nunits Hutchinson used (eighths of an inch), demonstrating considerably higher rainfall in \nthe later part of the record. These data were employed by Craddock (1976) within a study \nof changes in rainfall in the English regions since 1725. As a consequence, the values for \nthe Liverpool region in his analysis for the late-1780s and early-1790s appear \nanomalously high compared to values for almost any period since. \n \nOne might suspect from Figure 6 that Hutchinson must have changed his rain gauge, its \nlocation or some other aspect of his method of working at some point in the late 1780s. \nHowever, it is clear from other data sets from the region, including the extensive rainfall \n 15\ninformation for Manchester which was not included in the Craddock analysis, that this \npart of England had at least 20% more rainfall than normal in this period (Manley, 1972). \nThis high rainfall was not accompanied by especially low air pressure, as one might have \nexpected (Woodworth, 1985; Murphy and Washington, 2001). \n \nTen years of the Hutchinson record possess monthly rainfall totals (calculated as above) \nfor all 12 months and are unaffected by a large number of snow days. These have been \naveraged to compute an average annual rainfall total  of 37.93 inches and an average \nrainfall seasonal cycle: 2.87, 1.99, 1.90, 2.47, 3.01, 2.69, 3.81, 4.15, 3.64, 3.72, 3.59, 4.07 \ninches for January-December respectively. \n \nOne can compare these totals to those presented by Reynolds (1953) for the nearby \nBidston Observatory over the period 1867-1951, although absolute comparisons must \nalways be problematic when different rain gauges have been used at different, even \nnearby, locations. Nevertheless, the annual average rainfall total obtained by Reynolds \n(28.68 inches) and the Hutchinson average total are consistent, when one recalls that the \nHutchinson period is known to have been wetter than normal. The seasonal cycle in the \ntwo data sets is almost identical with lowest values in February-April. Summer (April-\nSeptember) accounts for 52 and 50 % of the annual total in the Hutchinson and Reynolds \ndata sets respectively. As far as one can make conclusions from short records, this \nsuggests little long term change in the seasonal cycle of rainfall at Liverpool, in contrast \nwith evidence from Paris which indicates increasing amounts of rain in winter over the \nlast three centuries (Slonosky, 2002). \n \nIn summary, the Hutchinson rainfall record appears to be consistent with information \nfrom elsewhere in NW England and with later rainfall measurements obtained nearby. \nConsequently, there is good reason to claim that Hutchinson was a conscientious \nobserver of rainfall also. \n 16\n \n4. A Long Term Liverpool Mean Sea Level Pressure Record \n \nIn 1845, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board established an Observatory at Waterloo \nDock in order to provide services to shipping (calibration of chronometers, provision of \ntidal, meteorological and astronomical data etc.). In 1866, the Observatory transferred to \nBidston on the Cheshire side of the Mersey, where meteorological measurements were to \ncontinue for more than a century (Reynolds, 1954; Jones, 1999). The quality of the \nmeasurements deteriorated after 1999, and they were discontinued in 2004 prior to the \ntransfer of the work of the Observatory (now the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory) \nto a new building in Liverpool. I shall refer to the combined Waterloo\/Bidston MSLP \ntime series to the end of 1999 as simply the \u2018Bidston\u2019 record. It can be downloaded from \nhttp:\/\/www.pol.ac.uk\/appl\/met.html.  \n \nFigure 7 shows annual MSLP values for Bidston, Edinburgh and London. Over the \ncommon observation period 1846-1995, the interannual variability in MSLP is similar at \nall three sites, correlation coefficients of the annual means being 0.849 (Bidston and \nEdinburgh), 0.856 (Bidston and London) and 0.818 (Edinburgh and London). \nConsequently, the time-dependence of each record is similar. However, there is a \nquestion concerning their average values. On average, Bidston MSLP is 0.67 mbar higher \nthan at Edinburgh and 2.70 mbar lower than at London. In other words, MSLP at Bidston \nis on average higher than at Edinburgh by only 20 % of the London-Edinburgh MSLP \ndifference. As Bidston is located roughly half-way between London and Edinburgh \n(Figure 1), one might have expected a higher percentage. \n \nA check of the quality of the Bidston MSLP record was made by comparison of annual \nmean values to those from Dublin, the record of the latter spanning 1831-1995 (Jones et \nal., 1999). Dublin is at a similar latitude to Bidston (Figure 1) and one might expect \nMSLP values to be similar. The correlation coefficient of annual MSLP over the period \n1846-1995 was found to be 0.893, while the rms of annual MSLP-difference was 0.74 \nmbar, and the average Dublin-Bidston MSLP difference was 0.71 mbar. One concludes \n 17\nthat the two MSLP records are in excellent agreement with regard to their time-\ndependence, but one (or both) could have a systematic offset. A second check was made \nwith the MSLP record from the nearby Manchester Airport for the period 1951-1999. \nManchester is also at a similar latitude to Bidston, but in the opposite direction to Dublin \n(Figure 1). The Manchester record also demonstrated excellent correlation with Bidston \n(0.954), rms of annual MSLP-difference of 0.47 mbar, and average Manchester-Bidston \nMSLP of 0.60 mbar. One concludes that Bidston\u2019s entire MSLP record might be biased \napproximately 0.6 mbar too low; more detailed checks demonstrate that a similar bias \nthroughout the record. (An identical conclusion is obtained with the use of median \npressure-differences between Bidston and other sites as with average pressure-\ndifferences.) \n \nFigure 7 includes the \u2018adjusted\u2019 Hutchinson record for 1768-1793, \u2018re-adjusted\u2019 by means \nof an overall offset such that the London-Liverpool and Liverpool-Edinburgh pressure \ndifferences are in the same proportion as for the 1846-1995 data (i.e. 4:1). This re-\nadjustment was undertaken using the calibration period 1774-1792 (less 1785) for which \ndata exist for all three sites. In fact, the average MSLPs for Edinburgh and London in this \nperiod are exactly the same as the averages during 1846-1995. Therefore, it was \nstraightforward to construct the re-adjusted Hutchinson record by setting its average \nduring the calibration period to equal MSLP at Bidston 1846-1995. This re-adjustment \nrequired a small increase to the pressures of the \u2018adjusted\u2019 series of 0.47 mbar. \n \nAs remarked on above in the discussion of Figure 4, the first years of the Hutchinson \nrecord appear far noisier than later, partly due to the lack of precision of the early \nmeasurements (especially for 1768). In addition, the Hutchinson annual means have a \nlarger rms than Edinburgh and London values over a common period (2.12 and 1.70 mbar \nusing 24 years of \u2018adjusted\u2019 Hutchinson and Edinburgh data respectively, and 1.90 and \n1.50 mbar using 19 years of \u2018adjusted\u2019 Hutchinson and London data respectively), and a \nlarger rms than the values from all sites during 1846-1995 (1.59, 1.54, 1.44 and 1.59 \nmbar for Bidston, Edinburgh, London and Dublin respectively). Therefore, the \ninterannual component of the Hutchinson record almost certainly has a poorer accuracy \n 18\nthan that of the other time series. This is in spite of the evident good quality at monthly \ntimescales, and the reasonably successful attempts at \u2018adjustment\u2019 for the larger shifts. A \ndifficulty in maintaining barometer calibration over many years might have been \nexpected, especially given Hutchinson\u2019s use of (what seems to have been) a single \ninstrument.  \n \nFigure 7 also includes 7 years of data spanning 1828-1834. These measurements were \nmade at Prince\u2019s Dock on the Liverpool waterfront, under the supervision of Jesse \nHartley, the Liverpool Dock Engineer, and were archived at the Royal Society. Similar \nbarometer measurements supervised by Hartley were made at two other docks (Salthouse \nand Queen\u2019s) but their records have faded badly and have not been used. Air pressures \nwere noted at each high water, providing approximately 60 samples for a monthly mean. \nNo other measurement details are available. One suspects that the barometers were every-\nday instruments read by the dockmasters\u2019 assistants. The Prince\u2019s data have been \u2018re-\nadjusted\u2019 to lie between Edinburgh and London using a similar procedure as for the \nHutchinson data. The correlation coefficients between annual mean values at Prince\u2019s and \nthose at Edinburgh and London are 0.555 and 0.638 respectively, compared to 0.897 \nbetween Edinburgh and London in the same period. (In principle, the Prince\u2019s high-water \nair pressures could be adjusted for the local lunar atmospheric tides. However, their \namplitudes are an order of magnitude lower than the solar tides which were themselves \ndemonstrated above to be small, Chapman and Lindzen, 1970.) \n \nThe \u2018re-adjusted\u2019 time series still has major gaps between 1794-1827 and 1835-1845 \nduring which several significant meteorological events are known to have occurred. For \nexample, the \u2018Great Storm\u2019 of 6 January 1839, possibly the worst storm in Liverpool in \nthe last few 100 years and in which about 200 people died, falls in one of the gaps (Lamb, \n1991). Dublin MSLP could be \u2018re-adjusted\u2019 to fill the second gap. However, an \nalternative procedure, suitable for both gaps, is simply to scale the Edinburgh and \nLondon values in a manner consistent with experience of the later Bidston record, such \nthat the Liverpool value is higher than at Edinburgh by 20 % of the London-Edinburgh \nMSLP difference. Figure 7 demonstrates the resulting annual MSLP time series for \n 19\nLiverpool from 1768 to 1999, based primarily on the Bidston record, together with a \ncombination of Hutchinson, Prince\u2019s and scaled Edinburgh and London data. A \nsystematic uncertainty of approximately 0.6 mbar can be attached to the entire \nLiverpool\/Bidston time series for the reasons given above, with the series possibly biased \nlow by that amount. The source of this bias is so far unknown. \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nThis study has demonstrated that most of the Hutchinson meteorological information is of \ngood quality. As a result, it has shown William Hutchinson to have been a conscientious \nand accurate observer of the weather. By implication, it is most probable that his tidal \ndata were of good quality also. A test of the validity of the \u2018inverse barometer\u2019, using the \nHutchinson monthly air pressure and tidal data sets, confirmed that both records must \nhave been well-measured. The Hutchinson air pressure record has been combined \nsatisfactorily with later data from Liverpool to make a near-continuous time series from \n1768 to the end of the 20th century.  \n \nIn spite of accuracy limitations of the Hutchinson air pressure data on longer \n(interannual) timescales, his time series is a valuable contribution from NW England to a \ndeveloping set of UK and European meteorological \u2018data archaeology\u2019 (e.g. Ansell et al., \n2006), with air pressure records from some northern European sites now extending back \nto the late 17th or early 18th centuries (e.g. Bergstr\u00f6m and Moberg, 2002; K\u00f6nnen and \nBrandsma, 2005). As more long air pressure records are extracted from archives, \nconverted into computer-accessible form, and subjected to a level of quality control \nwhich is possible only when multiple time series are available for analysis, then \nsignificantly greater insight will be obtained into long term air pressure and atmospheric \ncirculation change. \n 20\n \nAcknowledgements \n \nPeter Burgess did an excellent job in transferring most of the Hutchinson meteorological \ndata into computer files.
