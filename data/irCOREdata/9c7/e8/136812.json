INTRODUCTION  \nDriven by a widespread understanding of the Internet\u2019s \ncapabilities, the power of e-commerce, and advances in \nwireless technologies and devices, mobile commerce is rapidly \napproaching the business forefront. According to independent \nresearch findings, m-commerce, which is defined as the \ncommercial transactions conducted through a mobile device \nover a wireless telecommunication network in a wireless \nenvironment [1, 2], will soon be a dominant force in business \nand society. The ITU recently announced that subscriber \nnumbers had passed the 1.6 billion mark worldwide by early \n2005, and with half of the mobile devices Internet-enabled. \nFurthermore, the major research findings by IDC estimate that \n80% of the UK\u2019s population will own and regularly use an \nInternet-enabled phone by 2005.  Worldwide, there were 94.9 \nmillion users of m-commerce in 2003 and this is expected to \ngrow to 1.67 billion in 2008, resulting in estimated global \nrevenue of US $554.37 billion [3]. This phenomenal growth in \nmobile device ownership along with the integration and \ninteroperability of Wireless Local Access Network (WLAN) \nand the third generation (3G) technologies is driving: \napplication developers to invent more value-added-services \nthat attract more Internet-enabled mobile users, and researchers \nto investigate the contextual influence behind m-commerce. \nM-Commerce enables a new mode of information exchange \nand purchases, and it presents an unexplored domain. To \nconsumers, it represents convenience; merchants associate it \nwith a huge earning potential; service providers view it as a \nlarge unexplored market; governments look it as a viable and \nhighly productive connection with their constituents [4]. \nMobile commerce is more than a mobile and wireless \nextension of the Web-based e-commerce. It is an entirely new \nsales and promotion channel and is the enabler for a whole \nrange of new services such as buying air tickets, paying tax, \nreserving a table in a restaurant. Most importantly, it follows \nthe user and is available anytime and anywhere. \nIn this paper, the current technologies that apply to m-\ncommerce are discussed - WAP and i-mode, and their status \nreviewed. According to the characteristics of m-commerce, the \npaper proposes an ideal m-commerce architecture, and two \nscenarios are used to illustrate this architecture by simulation. \nThe key findings from the authors\u2019 currently running web-\nbased market survey strongly support the results of the \nsimulation. Finally, the paper concludes with suggestions for \nfuture work. \nII. STATE OF THE ART OF MOBILE COMMERCE \nIn order to allow access to the Web from mobile devices, \nthe WAP promoted by the WAP Forum is optimised for the \nwireless environment. It is the most popular Internet-enabling \ntechnology being adopted by handset manufactures and \nservice providers in Europe and America [5].  Moreover, in \nJapan there exists a proprietary wireless data and mobile \nInternet access service promoted by NTT-DoCoMo called i-\nmode, which attracted 43 million customers by February 2005 \n[6]. \nA. WAP for m-commerce \nThe WAP 1.0, published in 1998, is a broadly used and \naccepted protocol standard designed to enable different kinds \nof wireless devices to communicate and access the Internet. \nThis was a major diffusion of innovation [7]. The WAP 1.0 \narchitecture is based on a client-server relationship. The WAP \nclient communicates with the WAP gateway by sending its \nrequest and receiving the content from the Internet. This \narchitecture\u2019s goals were: to provide a layered, scalable and \nextensible architecture that would support as many wireless \nnetworks as possible; to optimize communication for \nnarrowband bearers, such as Short Message Service (SMS); to \noptimize the use of local device resources, such as memory and \npower consumption; to provide secure applications for the \n745\n2005 Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications, Perth, Western Australia, 3 - 5 October 2005.\n0-7803-9132-2\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE.\nwireless devices; and to provide a programming model for \ntelephony services and integration. \nThe existence of the gateway in WAP is one of the \nfundamental differences between the WWW and the WAP \nprogramming model. The functionality of the WAP gateway is \nto translate the request from HyperText Markup Language \n(HTML)\/ HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\/Internet \nProtocol (IP) to a WAP format, which is better suited for Over-\nThe-Air (OTA) transmissions, and to send the response to the \nWAP client. Even though the gateway can act as a proxy server \nand therefore can be anywhere on the network, it usually \nbelongs to a third-party vendor. Taking into account the mobile \ncommerce transaction, this model raises two major concerns: \nscalability and security. From the scalability point of view, the \ngateway represents a single point of failure and a bottleneck \ndue to the end-to-end flow control. From the security point of \nview, as it provides protocol translations and compression of \ncontent, it acts as a \u201cbuilt-in man in the middle\u201d and is \nvulnerable to hackers\u2019 attacks. WAP has defined Wireless \nTransport Layer Security (WTLS), with the aim of solving this \nproblem and providing privacy, data integrity and \nauthentication between mobile phones and WAP gateways. \nHowever, WTLS does not provide end-to-end security between \nclient and merchant servers if the merchant server is not \nequipped with the whole WAP protocol stack [8]. In such a \nsituation, a company such as a bank or a large financial \ninstitution has to own and manage a WAP gateway within a \ntrusted environment when they perform the m-commerce \ntransaction procedures. \nDue to the problems that come with the gateway, Version \n2.0 of WAP suggests not to use the gateway but use instead \nInternet\u2019s standards: eXtensible HTML (XHTML), \nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) \/IP, HTTP and Transport \nLayer Security (TLS). The most important goal for WAP 2.0 is \nto bring the mobile Internet services and standardization closer \nto Internet standards [9].  \nB. i-mode for Mobile Commerce \nWith i-mode, mobile phone users gain easy access to more \nthan 88,000 Internet sites form anywhere, anytime in Japan. As \ni-mode is not an open standard, the amount of available \ninformation and its breadth of use are limited at the moment to \nJapan and a few experiments around the world, particularly in \nEurope [6].  \n \nFigure 1.  i-mode network architecture \ni-mode is an enormous client-server network  that resides on \ntop of a packet data network. In the case of Japan this is \nDoCoMo\u2019s proprietary Personal Digital Cellular-Packet system \n(PDC-P), which runs on the PDC telecommunication system, \n1500 MHz air interface. However, if and when i-mode is \nexported to other countries it will need to run on other packet \ndata networks such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) \nand Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). \nFig. 1 shows the i-mode network architecture. \nThe Packet Gateway Module (PGW) is responsible for \ntransition to other networks, e.g. to offer a Virtual Private \nNetwork (VPN). The Mobile-Service Control Point (M-SCP) \ndeals with the authentication of user data - this point is similar \nto voice communication. The Packet Processing Module \n(PPM) between the Base Station (BS) and PGW or M-PGW \nimplements the packet connection with the mobile end-devices. \nThe Mobile Message-Packet Gateway Module (M-PGW) \ntransforms the TCP with the i-mode server and Transport \nLayer Protocol (TLP) with PPM [10]. \nThe core of this network is the i-mode centre, which serves \nas the relay for transmissions between the i-mode network and \nthe Internet. When subscribers access i-mode or exchange mail, \nall of the information passes through the centre. The i-mode \nserver, which represents the contents of \u201cContent Providers\u201d, \nconsists of multiple server systems. Each server system is \nresponsible for special tasks. The i-mode system housed in the \ncentre has three main functions: 1) it provides functions to send \nand receive i-mode mail; 2) it relays information from the \nservers maintained by both official and unofficial Content \nProviders (CPs) to \u201ciMenu\u201d; and 3) it relays accesses from i-\nmode compatible mobile phones to the Internet [11]. The i-\nmode server also has a database that stores the personalized \n\u201cMy Menu\u201d site lists and other information for subscribers. \nThe server sends information associated with subscriber \nrequests every time subscribers access \u201ciMenu\u201d from their \nmobile phones.  \nThe idea behind i-mode is to use the HTML and HTTP as \nmuch as possible. As the i-mode service is not based on WAP, \nit does not require Wireless Markup Language (WML) to \nproduce front-end applications for mobile phone screens. The \ni-mode services are based on compact HTML (cHTML) as its \nmarkup language and it supports high-resolution colour \ncontent, hence one of its successful attributes in attracting \nsubscribers to the wireless Internet compared to WAP access. \nThe main advantage of i-mode is the fact that the service is not \ngarden-walled like many of the wireless service portals \navailable in Europe and the USA [5]. Companies and \nindividuals alike are able to create their own compatible \nInternet sites that can be accessed through the i-mode service. \nIII. CURRENT STATUS-CONVERGENCE VS. COMPETITION \nBoth WAP and i-mode are popular standards for writing m-\ncommerce applications. The mobile industry is working hard to \nevolve new applications for m-commerce. Currently, there are \nnumerous companies providing e-commerce services through \nWAP around the world, and with the huge mobile telephone \nsubscriber base, the potential for m-commerce is tremendous \n[12].  Even though WAP has had a slow start, both in the \ndevice and the applications, it is starting to gather some \nmomentum technically and must now be considered on its \nP PDC Packet System\nInternetM-SCP PGW M-PGW\nPPM PPM\nBS BS BS BS\nMS MS MSMS\nOfficial\nCP\nUnofficial\nCP\nConnection Network\nPDC-P\nNetwork Access\nServer\nData\nBase\nData\nBase\ni-mode server\ni-mode Centre\nPDC: Personal Digital Cellular\nTelecommunication System\nPDC\n746\ntechnical merit. WAP will gradually merge into the HTTP \nstack, and with more reliable and better networks, the only \nvalid reason for keeping it would be for WML, which caters to \nsmall form factor devices. However, WML 2.0 is also expected \nto merge into XHTML. With mobile networks such as GPRS \nand UMTS, WAP can access mobile Internet with high data \nrate, \u201calways-on\u201d, and be charged by volume. Most of the \neffort in redesigning an application for WML is to migrate to \nan eXtensible ML (XML) model. Once that is done, the actual \nsyntax of the markup language is almost a trivial factor. \nAt the same time, the growth in the number of i-mode \nsubscribers has far exceeded the expectations held at the time i-\nmode was launched. To cope with this and the advance in i-\nmode features, DoCoMo has currently updated the i-mode \ncentre with the deployment of the new CiRCUS system, which \nis an advanced network technology that realizes state-of-the-art \nreliability. The CiRCUS system can incorporate many servers \nthat are normally idle to solve the glitch occurring in a server \nand adopt a kind of parent-child structure that utilises master \nand replica servers by the difference in the level of their \nauthority to create information detours [11].  \nOf course, i-mode is a serious competitor of WAP 2.0. It has \nbeen suggested that WAP may push ahead of i-mode in \npopularity because WAP has a large community of developers, \nwhereas the tightly NTT-controlled i-mode may be stifled by \nlack of development mass [13]. As i-mode evolves towards \nsupport of XHTML and TCP, with the current WAP evolution, \nthese two technologies will probably converge by evolving i-\nmode platforms to support WAP users by enabling WAP \nphones to access i-mode content. This is being done in Japan, \nand it is one way for i-mode manufacturers and service \nproviders to sell more equipment and services. By enabling a \nWAP user to obtain i-mode content, an i-mode service provider \ncould use the product as a way of convincing the WAP user to \nbuy their primary service from the i-mode carrier. Most likely, \na gateway function will be used to act as a mediation and \nconversion access point. \n In all probabilities, cHTML will become the common \nmarkup language for both i-mode and WAP. This convergence \nfor the technologies will create more opportunities for content \nproviders and the Internet industries, resulting in more \napplications to m-commerce users, which can then expand the \nsubscriber base in order to grow the revenue stream. \nIV. M-COMMERCE APPLICATION SCENARIOS \nThe range of applications that characterise m-commerce \nactivities can be largely divided into three categories [14]: \n\u2022 Content Delivery: The roaming user can be provided \nwith information, alerts, entertainment or \nadvertisements based on their location. \n\u2022 Financial Transaction: Location-based transactions are \nperhaps the most complex set of services. The main \nthrust of the business model is billing based on the \ncustomer\u2019s location, while a mobile banking \napplication can be customised to quickly deliver secure \nbanking services and provide another value-added \nbenefit. \n\u2022 Location Based: Driving directions and the tracking of \nfreight, packages and people are a core segment of the \nemerging Location-Based-Service (LBS) market. \nIntelligent transportation systems are being introduced \naround the world, and location-based technology plays \na key part in almost every solution.  \nAccording to the characteristics of m-commerce business-to-\nconsumer (B2C) commerce, an ideal mobile e-commerce \narchitecture is as shown in Fig. 2. Such a system shall support \nthe following: 1) Client authentication, 2) Server authentication, \neach party needs to be able to be authenticated by their \ncounterpart to ensure that the counterpart is who they claim to \nbe. 3) Secure channel, i.e., encrypted channel. 4) User-friendly \npayment scheme supporting micropayment, i.e., buy small \nthings and to pay small amounts of money. The administrative \ncharges for such payments must be small compared to the \npayments. 5) Receipt delivery, which contains reservation and \ntransaction information. 6) Simple user interface, which is \nsuitable for the mobile users to enter their personal data in any \nkind of situation [14, 15]. \nIn order to test and write applications to be readable by \nWAP-enabled devices, WAP emulator software can be used on \ncomputers. This software can then be used to simulate and test \nthe actions of both WAP gateway and WAP-enabled mobile \ndevices, which are currently the main technology devices \nutilising WAP. A number of freely available WAP emulation \nsoftware application packages exist to simulate WAP effects.  \nIn the following, two m-commerce execution scenarios are \ndeveloped using the Nokia WAP emulator version 4.0 and \nshowcased in detail in order to further elaborate Fig. 2 - the \nideal m-commerce architecture.  \nThe first scenario, which is illustrated in Fig. 3, is concerned \nwith a LBS service that provides a list of restaurants, which are \nlocated near to the current location and match a set of user \npreferences. This reservation service starts with the request \nfrom the browser to its Profile Agent (PA). The PA requests \nthe list of context components such as network type and user \nlocation. In the presented example, the user is located in \nBirmingham; the PA forwards this information to both \nNetwork Agent (NA) and Local Restaurant Service Provider \n(LRSP) and requests the restaurant list from the LRSP. After \nobtaining the local restaurant report, the PA forwards it to the \nuser together with the user\u2019s preference. The PA processes the \nuser\u2019s requirement and sends confirmation to the SMS-C. This \nservice is completed with a displayed confirmation on the \nuser\u2019s mobile phone from SMS-C. For this reservation service, \ntourists are a key customer segment requiring the location-\nbased information, since they are most often found in \nunfamiliar geographic surroundings. \n \nFinancial Institution\nUser\nPrivate Key\nCrypto\nFunction\nCrypto\nFunction\nMerchant\nPrivate Key\nShort Message Service-Centre\nSMS-C\nFinancial Institution\nFinancial Institution\nCredit Card Validation\nReceipt\nSecure Communication\nServer Authentication\nClient Authentication\nClient\nConfirmation\nSigh message\nServerContent Request\nContent Response\n \nFigure 2.

Mobile ticket ordering procedures and signalling flow \n \nThe second scenario, illustrated in Fig. 4, presents a whole \nfinancial transaction procedure by purchasing an air ticket \nwhile mobile. This is more complicated than the first scenario \nas it involves a money transaction and payment procedure. The \ninitial steps are similar to the first scenario, which inputs a set \nof user preferences, such as departure time, destination and \nticket type. Following this information, the user comes to a \nsecure domain, which hosts financial institutions or banks. This \nstep is a significant part in m-commerce applications. The \nmoney transaction will be performed in this secure channel by \nselecting the payment type. After the user performs the digital \nsignature for the contract sent by the SMS-C which captures all \nthe information about the transaction, the bank will generate a \nreceipt and then sends it together with the Uniform Resource \nLocator (URL) continuation to the browser via the WAP \ngateway, and at the same time, the SMS-C sends a mobile \nticket with bar-code. This kind of mobile ticket service creates \nan extra purchase possibility for public transportation tickets \nvia the mobile phone. Even though the scenarios described \nabove are complicated, from the mobile users\u2019 point of view, it \nis transparent and offers the benefit of being able to purchase \ngoods and request services at anytime, anywhere, without the \nconstraints of opening hours and physical distribution points, \nand most importantly, it is a cashless payment.  \nFrom the procedures that have been presented in the two \nscenarios, it is clear to see that there are two critical procedures \nthat urgently need to be solved: user input usability between the \nclient and server, and credit card payment security, which is \nperformed by financial institutions. As the mobile phone user \nhas to scroll through the information categories available for \nrequest and select the category by pressing a key on the phone \npad, a wireless device must be easy to use. In this respect, \nusability could be the critical limitation. Security is still the \nmain concern of business to adapt m-commerce for Intranet \nand extranet applications.

WEB-BASED MARKET SURVEY \nThe importance of the factors affecting or determining \npatterns of m-commerce usage has been emphasised in the \nprevious section. Taking this into account, the authors \nconducted a research study of  user preference on mobile \nservices in early 2005, which is available at [16]  in order to \ninvestigate the perception and acceptability rates of different \nmobile services among current and potential users. The study \nwas based primarily in Europe, with more than 200 respondents \nfrom different communities, age groups, professions, etc. \nHowever, the teenagers\/young adult age group (19-30 years) \nwas chosen as being the major focus group, since this \ngeneration is known to have the most familiarity with and \naccess to the latest wireless technologies. \n   The range of different applications offered presents an \ninteresting theme to study. As three categories are addressed \nabove, content delivery has been divided into Information \nServices and Entertainment Services, which together with \nFinancial Transactions and Location Based Services, provide \nfour types of service to rank by user\u2019s preference. One of the \nmost important results of the research was a comparative \nevaluation of all the above services by the participants. This \nprovides a useful insight into the user\u2019s choices and \npreferences. This is an important input to design content \nstrategy formulation, and could also be an important issue to \nconsider for developing marketing strategy. The research \nfindings show that in spite of all the marketing hype about the \nrange of services that m-commerce promises to provide, 70% \nof people still ranked traditional information services as their \nmost important preference. Both entertainment services and \nfinancial transactions have been ranked as the least important \nby one-third of the respondents [17].  Moreover, from the first \n200 respondents, 78% selected \u201cease of use\u201d and 79% selected \n\u201csecurity\u201d as \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cvery important\u201d factors, which \ninfluenced their adoption of the mobile services. When asked \nthe reasons for interest in buying a 3G mobile phone, \u201cservices \navailable\u201d was the main reason, and followed by the \u201cbattery \nlife\u201d, \u201cease of use\/functionality\u201d and \u201chandset size\/colour \nappearance\u201d. \nVI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS \nWith the exception of cost, the major factors that influence \nmobile users are usability and security. The rich content is still \nthe key attraction from the user\u2019s perspective. These research \nfindings provide an insight into the user\u2019s perception of the \ntelecommunication sector and suggest that interface developers \nneed to consider the application-specific functionality, ease of \nuse and the ability to interact among different user tasks. \nApplication developers should also consider the interaction \nbetween the context of the environment, e.g. the location, and \nthe device. A comparative framework for evaluating the \nusability and security of m-commerce applications is necessary.  \nThere are also many other factors that may influence the \nadoption of m-commerce, such as lack of killer applications \nand cultural influences. Having said that, the benefits from m-\ncommerce touch on many aspects of the value chain. For \nservice providers, it can add significant value to their existing \nvoice offerings by adding m-commerce based data services; the \nintegration of a microbrowser into the product line would allow \na handset manufacturer to meet the demands of today\u2019s \nadvanced service providers; application developers can reach \nthe largest audience when they write their applications in \nXHTML; ultimately, the subscribers are the most important \nbeneficiaries of m-commerce applications [18]. \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] S.J.
