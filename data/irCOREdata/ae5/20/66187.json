This suggests that the greater involvement of men in aggression \nmight derive from men\u2019s higher levels of anger or from their lower levels of \nfear and fear-related inhibition.  A review of the relevant literature strongly \nsuggests that there are no sex differences in anger but pronounced \ndifferences in fear, especially of physical danger.  Three forms of behavioral \ninhibition (reactive, effortful and self control) which build developmentally on \nan infrastructure of fear, show negative associations with aggression and sex \ndifferences generally favouring females.  Cognitive inhibition shows weaker \nassociations with aggression (when IQ is controlled) and inconsistent sex \ndifferences.  Empathy and guilt, both of which are correlated with inhibition, \naggression and sex, are also considered as possible mediators. The relative \nutility of evolutionary and social role theories in accounting for this pattern of \nfindings is considered. \n \n \n \n \n 3\nMen engage in more direct aggression than women, although the effect \nsize varies as a function of the seriousness of the act and the data source.  \nThe results of several meta-analytic reviews are summarised in Table 1.  The \nmain conclusion to be drawn is that the magnitude of the sex difference \nincreases with the increasingly dangerous nature of the behavior1.  Physical \naggression shows stronger sex differences than verbal aggression and this is \nconsistent across data sources and across nations (Archer, 2004).  Sex \ndifferences are larger in real-world than in experimental settings and men are \nclearly over-represented in the more dangerous forms of aggression (Archer, \n2004).  Data from the United States (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2000) show \nthat the rate of violent offending by men is 1 offender for every 9 males aged \n10 or over, while the comparable rate for women is 1 in 56, giving a per capita \nrate six times higher among men than among women.  As the act of violence \nbecomes more serious, the proportion of women\u2019s involvement decreases. \nFourteen per cent of simple assaults (attacks without a weapon resulting \neither in no injury or a minor injury) are perpetrated by women compared to \nten per cent of homicides and aggravated assaults (which involve a weapon \nor serous injury) (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2002).   \nOffering a complete psychological explanation of these figures requires \na consideration of both gender and aggression.  Yet in the past, the \ncontribution of these two fields of study has not been equal.  The sex \ndifference in aggression has most often been approached as an issue within \n                                                 \n1  Indirect forms of aggression are not considered in the present article. They \nshow a highly variable sex difference between d = -.02 and d=-.74, depending \non the method of data collection (Archer, 2004).  Speculatively, it might be \nsuggested that higher levels of fear and inhibition among females contribute to \ntheir greater involvement in this form of aggression. \n \n 4\nthe field of sex differences in social behavior more generally.  Gender schema \n(Martin, Ruble & Szkrybalo, 2002), social role (Eagly, 1987) and social \ncognitive (Bussey & Bandura, 1999) theories ascribe a central role to \nstereotypic representations of gender which, through different proximal \nmechanisms, drive conformity.  This approach has been used to explain \ndifferences in a variety of domains such as leadership (Eagly & Johnson, \n1990), helping behavior (Eagly & Crowley, 1986) and interpersonal style \n(Cross & Madson, 1997), as well as aggression (Eagly & Steffen, 1986).  The \npresent article seeks to redress the balance by examining recent \ndevelopments in aggression research in order to identify candidate \npsychological mediators which may underlie the sex difference.   \nStudies of the effect of provocation and emotional arousal provide a \nuseful roadmap with which to begin this journey.  Provocation increases \naggression (Berkowitz, 1989; Bettencourt and Miller, 1996).  Provocation also \ndiminishes the magnitude of the sex difference, from d = .33 to d = .17 \n(Bettencourt and Miller, 1996).  Knight, Guthrie, Page and Fabes (2002) \nexamined emotional arousal as an explanation of this effect.  They proposed \nthat at very low levels of arousal, sex differences are small because both \nsexes are able to regulate their emotion and behavior. At high levels of \nemotional arousal, processes necessary for emotional and behavioral \nregulation are likely to be equally disrupted in both sexes. However at \nintermediate levels, men either experience greater emotional arousal or \nweaker ability to control their emotional behavior. Confirming this hypothesis \nthey found a curvilinear pattern in which effect sizes favouring males were \ngreatest at small and medium levels of arousal but small when arousal was \n 5\neither at baseline or very high.  Hence real world sex differences may be \nattributable either to women\u2019s lower levels of anger (impulsion) or their greater \nability to inhibit or control the expression of anger through aggressive acts \n(restraint).  \nThis distinction between impelling and restraining forces forms the \norganisational structure of this paper.  Aggression can be thought of as a \ncontingent strategy that results where the value of the rewards multiplied by \nthe probability of obtaining them exceeds the value of the costs multiplied by \nthe likelihood of incurring them (Campbell, 2005).  The costs include the \npossibility of injury or death. The rewards include the acquisition or \nmaintenance of valued resources.  In recent years, the role of emotion in \nguiding such decision making has been increasingly explored (Bechara, \nDamasio & Damasio, 2000; Cosmides & Tooby, 2000; Frijda, 1986; Le Doux, \n1996; Lerner & Keltner, 2000, 2001; Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee & Welch, \n2001; Rogers, Ramnani, Mackay, Wilson, Jezzard, Carter et al., 2004).  While \nanger energises behavior and impels attack, fear (and psychological \nprocesses that are built on an infrastructure of fear) inhibits behavior and \ncounsels withdrawal (Blanchard & Blanchard, 2003; Harmon-Jones, 2003; \nPanksepp, 1998).  Hence it is reasonable to propose that the likelihood of \naggression depends upon the relative strength of these two emotions.  In the \ncontext of sex differences in aggression, do men and women differ in the \nstrength of their anger (impulsion) or in fear and fear-related inhibition \n(restraint)?   \nAlthough the present article focuses upon these emotional and \nmotivational bases, this in no way diminishes the importance of cognitive \n 6\nprocesses or the possibility of sex differences in them.  It is increasingly clear \nthat emotion and cognition are intimately connected (Cosmides & Tooby, \n2000) especially in the control of aggressive behavior.  Anger can affect depth \nof processing, facilitate recall, and prime aggressive scripts and knowledge \nstructures (Anderson & Bushman, 2002).  Fear -provoking stimuli (detected \nsupraliminally or preconciously) recruit selective attention (Mogg & Bradley, \n1998) eliciting coordinated cognitive and behavioral activity designed to deal \nwith the threat (\u0150hman, 1993).  While, for reasons of space, I confine myself \nchiefly to consideration of emotion, sex differences in the link between \nemotion and cognition warrants serious consideration.  \nIn order to evaluate the present proposal, I first identify psychological \nfactors that enhance and diminish the probability of aggression. Ideally, we \nwould want to demonstrate that, when each of these candidate variables is \ncontrolled, the magnitude of the sex difference in aggression is eliminated or \nsignificantly reduced.  Where such analyses have been undertaken, they are \ndiscussed.  However, because of the novelty of the present proposal, such \ndata are often unavailable.  In these cases, I review evidence for each \nvariable\u2019s association with aggression and for evidence of sex differences.  \nMy aim here is preliminary rather than definitive: To narrow the range of \npossible mediating variables so that future studies can directly address their \nutility in explaining sex differences in aggression.                \nFactors enhancing aggressive behavior. \nAnger \nAnger is an unpleasant or negative emotion that typically occurs in \nresponse to threat, disruption of ongoing behavior or deliberate and unjustified \n 7\nharm (Kring, 2000; Panksepp, 1998).  Although anger may not be a necessary \nprerequisite for some forms of instrumental aggression, in reactive aggression \nit is a common emotional response to provocation. Few sex differences have \nbeen found in the frequency or intensity of anger, and those that do tend to \nfavour women (Averill, 1982; Brody, 1997; Grossman & Wood, 1993; Kring, \n2000; Sharkin, 1993).  In a poll of over 2,000 Americans, women reported \nmore episodes of anger during the last seven days than men even after \ncontrolling for sex differences in emotional expressiveness (Mirowsky & Ross, \n1995).  Experimental studies which elicit anger through the presentation of \nfilm clips or slides do not generally find sex differences in anger intensity \n(Kring & Gordon, 1998; Wagner, Buck & Winterbotham, 1993).  Experiments \nusing vignettes to elicit descriptions of hypothetical emotional reactions \nsimilarly find few overall sex differences in anger intensity (Manstead & \nFisher, 1995; Milovchevich, Howells, Drew & Day, 2001) and, where they \nappear on subsidiary analyses, they favour women (Brody, Lovas & Hay, \n1995; Harris, 1994).   \nArcher and Mehdikhani (2003) in a meta-analysis of psychometrically \nassessed anger derived from 22 samples found no sex difference, d = .006.  \nIn a larger study of 46 self-reported anger studies published between 1967 \nand 2000, Archer (2004) also found no sex difference, d = -.003.  Studies \nappearing since that time have generally supported this conclusion (Birditt & \nFingerman, 2003; Costa, Terracciano & McCrae, 2001; Deffenbacher, \nDeffenbacher, Lynch & Richards, 2003; Paixao, Oliveira, Page, Uwah & \nCarlton, 2001; Ramirez, Santisteban, Fujihara & Van Goozen, 2002; \nYarcheski, Mahon & Yarcheski, 2002; Zwaal, Prkachin, Husted & Stones, \n 8\n2003).  Brebner (2003) used a large Australian (N=2199) and international \nsample (N=6868).  In both samples, women reported a slightly greater \nfrequency of anger, d= -.06 and d= -.05, and in the international sample \nwomen rated their anger as somewhat more intense than that of males, d= -\n.14.  Similarly, in a United States sample (Simon & Nath, 2004), women and \nmen did not differ in anger frequency, although in a subsample of those \nexperiencing anger once a day during the previous week, women\u2019s anger was \nmore intense and long lasting.   \nIn Berkowitz\u2019s (1989) model of aggression, negative affect mediates \nthe relationship between provocation and aggression.  Negative affect may \nwell include anger but is sufficiently broad to include other negative emotions \nor moods experienced in response to provocation.  Bettencourt and Miller \n(1996) examined the possible role of negative affect (operationalised as \njudges\u2019 ratings of the extent to which the participant would feel \u201cunpleasant or \nnegative emotions\u201d) as a moderator of sex differences in aggression. Higher \nlevels of judged negative affect were associated with smaller sex differences \nin aggression, beta = -.13, suggesting that the elicitation of negative mood \nstates diminishes the sex difference in aggression.  However male and female \njudges did not differ in these ratings and hence \u201cgender differences in \nsubjective negative affect did not affect gender differences in aggression\u201d \n(Bettencourt & Miller, 1996, p.440).  Men\u2019s more frequent use of aggression \ndoes not seem to arise from the fact that they experience higher levels of \nanger or negative affect. \nAnger expression \n 9\nThough men and women do not differ in frequency or intensity of \nanger, they may differ in their readiness to express it.  Studies of anger \nexpression typically employ self-reports, spontaneous facial and vocal \nexpressions and psychophysiological measures of face muscle activity (Kring, \n2000).  In self\u2013report studies of anger expression, sex differences have not \nbeen found (Allen & Haccoun, 1976; Balswick & Avertt, 1977; Burrowes & \nHalberstadt, 1987; Dosser, Balswick & Halverson, 1983; Ganong & Coleman, \n1985; King & Emmons, 1990).  Studies that have used Spielberger\u2019s Anger \nExpression Inventory (Spielberger, Johnson, Russell, Crane, Jacobs & \nWorden, 1985) also find no sex differences in reports of anger expression and \nanger suppression (see Kring, 2000). In vignette studies sex differences are \nrare but, where they are significant, more women than men report that they \nwould express their anger (Brody, 1993; Dosser et al., 1983; Timmers, \nFischer & Manstead, 1998 but see Ramirez et al., 2002).  Studies that employ \nspontaneous facial expressions find either no sex differences or that women \nare more expressive of anger than men (see Kring, 2000; Zwaal et al., 2003).  \nIn summary, women and men differ little in the degree to which they openly \nexpress their anger to others. Hence sex differences in aggression are \nunlikely to be attributable to sex differences in willingness or ability to \ncommunicate anger.    \nHowever a number of studies have found that men and women express \ntheir anger in different ways.  Men are more likely to directly confront the \ntarget of their anger and to verbally and physically assault people (Timmers et \nal., 1998; Deffenbacher, Oetting, Lynch & Morris, 1996).  Women are more \nlikely discuss their anger with uninvolved people (Simon & Nath, 2004) and to \n 10\ncry (Averill, 1982; Campbell, 1993; Eagly & Steffen, 1986; Hoover-Dempsey, \nPlas & Wallston, 1986; Timmers et al. 1998; Zemen & Garber, 1996).   \nIn summary, there is little evidence for more intense or more frequent \nanger among men whether the data are collected from self reports, \npsychometric inventories, experiments or responses to hypothetical scenarios.  \nThe absence of sex differences in anger means that it is a weak candidate for \nmoderating sex differences in aggression (Bettencourt & Miller, 1996).  While \nthere are few differences in willingness to express anger, women are less \nlikely to directly challenge or attack their provoker, suggestive of the possibility \nof greater emotional and behavioral control by women.  \nFactors diminishing aggressive behavior. \nFear.  \nFear is \u201can evolutionarily conserved affective-motivational system that \ncan be activated under conditions of novelty, sudden or intense stimulation, \nreactions to danger prepared by evolution, social interactions with unfamiliar \nconspecifics and conditioned responses to punishment\u201d (Rothbart & Bates, \n1998, p. 109).  The fear system is \u201cdesigned to detect danger and produce \nresponses that maximise the probability of surviving\u201d (LeDoux, 1996, p.128).  \nThe amygdala in the temporal lobes plays a central role in coordinating \nimmediate response to fear-provoking stimuli (Davis, 1992).  Le Doux\u2019s (1996) \npioneering research on conditioned fear responses has identified two \nincoming neural pathways that are activated when the organism faces threat. \nThe \u201cfast\u201d route delivers crude sensory information from the thalamus to the \namygdala within 50 ms of a threat, allowing for an immediate response.  \nThrough the second \u201cslower\u201d system, the amygdala receives a more detailed \n 11\nevaluation of the threat from the relevant sensory cortex. This allows for more \nfinely discriminated and contextualised interpretations of the input.  Amygdala-\ncortical connections are bidirectional so that emotional states (such as fear) \nmay direct information processing to threatening stimuli and, reciprocally, \ncortical representations of threat can activate an emotional response \n(Damasio, 1994; Derryberry & Reed, 1994).  Once activated, the amygdala\u2019s \nconnections to a variety of other brain structures cause increases in heart \nrate, blood pressure, respiration, vigilance, ACTH secretion, and cortical \narousal.  Behaviorally, it triggers freezing and \u201cthese inhibitory connections \nallow the anticipatory activity in the fear system to suppress approach \nresponses that might lead the organism into a harmful situation\u201d (Derryberry & \nRothbart, 1997).  Fear and anger systems follow very similar neural pathways.  \nThe fear system runs from the central and lateral amygdala through the \nventral anterior and medial hypothalamus to the periagueductal gray (PAG) \nmatter; anger runs from the medial amygdala through the medial \nhypothalamus to the PAG (Panksepp, 1998).   \nIndividual differences in fearful behavior appear from about nine \nmonths of age and remain extremely stable over time (Kagan, 1998; Rothbart \n& Bates, 1998).  Infant fear is negatively related to later impulsivity and \naggression (Caspi & Silva, 1995; Rothbart & Bates, 1998).  Many studies \nhave found concurrent associations between fearlessness and externalizing \nproblems (Cimbora & McIntosh, 2003; Rothbart, Ahadi & Hershey, 1994). \nConversely children with high fear of novelty are more likely to develop \ninternalizing problems (Fox, Henderson, Marshall, Nichols & Ghera, 2005; \n 12\nKagan, 1998; Kagan, Snidman, Zentner & Peterson, 1999).  Is there evidence \nthat the sexes differ in the frequency or intensity of fear?  \nDevelopmentally, girls express fear earlier than boys (Nagy, Loveland, \nKopp, Orvos, Pal & Molnar, 2001).  In infancy, girls show more hesitation in \napproaching novel objects and greater distress (Gartstein & Rothbart, 2003; \nMartin, Wisenbaker, Baker, & Huttunen, 1997; Rothbart, 1988).  Cross-\nculturally, according to parental reports, boys show stronger approach \nbehavior than girls (Carey & McDevitt, 1978; Hsu, Soong, Stigler, Hong, & \nLiang, 1981; Maziade, Boudreault, Thivierge, Caperaa & Cote, 1984). In a \nlarge longitudinal Canadian sample establishing trajectories of personality \ndevelopment, more girls than boys were on the high fearfulness trajectory \n(Cote, Tremblay, Nagin, Zoccolillo and Vitaro, 2002). \nAmong adults, reviews have generally concluded that women \nexperience fear more intensely than men (Brody & Hall, 1993; Crawford, \nKippax, Onyx, Gault & Benton, 1992; Fischer, 1993; Gullone, 2000) although \nsome have argued that the sex difference is context specific (LaFrance & \nBanaji, 1992).  A 37 nation study found significant sex differences in the \nintensity, duration and nonverbal expression of fear (Fischer & Manstead, \n2000).  A more recent international survey (Brebner, 2003) found a significant \nsex difference in the reported frequency, d = -.17, and intensity. d = -.14, of \nfear in an international sample.  Differences have also been found in anxiety \nboth in the United States and cross-culturally (Simon & Nath, 2004; Costa et \nal., 2003; Feingold, 1994).  Women show greater increases in skin \nconductance and a more marked startle reflex to physically threatening \nscenes (Bradley, Cuthbert & Lang, 1999; McManis, Bradley, Berg, Cuthbert & \n 13\nLang, 2001).  Women express their fear more intensely, both verbally and \nnon-verbally, than do men (see Madden, Feldman Barrett & Pietromonaco, \n2000).  While women are superior to men in accurately identifying emotions, \nthey show a greater accuracy for decoding fear than other emotions (Hall, \nCarter & Horgan, 2000).       \nA phobia is a marked and persistent fear of clearly discernable \ncircumscribed objects or situations which the sufferer recognises to be \nexcessive or unreasonable (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, pp. 143).  \nTest norms and meta-analysis of the Fear Survey Schedule confirm that \nfemales score higher than males (Arrindell, Kolk, Pickersgill & Hageman, \n1993; Gullone & King, 1993).  Following adjustment for the influences of \nmasculinity, femininity, masculine gender role stress and dissimulation, \nbiological sex remains a consistent predictor for each of the 5 types of fear \n(social; agoraphobic; bodily injury, death and illness; sexual and aggressive \nscenes; and harmless animals) with females scoring higher than males \n(Arrindell et al., 1993).  In a study of animal fears, female biological sex also \nemerged as a consistent predictor of fear after controlling for gender role, \ndisgust sensitivity, neuroticism, psychoticism and age (Arrindell, Mulkens. Kok \n& Vollenbroek, 1999).  Anxiety sensitivity is a fear of harmful physical, social  \nand psychological consequences of fear itself.  Among women, scores are \nhighest on the physical factor on which they are significantly higher than men \n(Stewart, Taylor & Baker, 1997), while men show the reverse pattern, scoring \nlowest on physical fears.   The same pattern is found among children and \nadolescents (Walsh, Stewart, McLaughlin & Comeau, 2004).  Females appear \n 14\nto be specially sensitized to threats to their physical integrity while males show \nstronger fear of threats to their mental health or social standing.  \nMen make riskier decisions than women (Hersch, 1997). Because this \nsex difference is especially marked when the risks are physical or life-\nthreatening (Hersch, 1997) and when risky behavior rather than hypothetical \nchoices are examined, it has been suggested that \u201cfear responses may \nexplain gender differences in risk taking more adequately than the cognitive \nprocesses involved in the reflective evaluation of options\u201d (Byrnes, Miller & \nSchafer, 1999, pp. 378).  Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee and Welch (2001) \npropose that current theories of risk overestimate the role of cognition and \nunderestimate the impact of fear.  While reflective cognition is useful for \nmaking true-false decisions, emotions are central to approach-avoidance \ndecisions (Frijda, 1986).  Fear favours cautious, risk-averse decisions (Lerner \n& Keltner, 2000, 2001).  In contrast to expected utility models, fear is \ninsensitive to probability variation: \u201cFeelings of fear\u2026 may be sensitive to the \npossibility rather than the probability of negative consequences\u201d (Loewenstein \net al. 2001, p.276).  Fear, like a good fire alarm, has a low threshold of \nresponse because a false positive is less harmful than a false negative.  As \nthe prospect of an aversive event approaches in time, fear increases although \nthe probability and negative utility remain constant.  In explaining the sex \ndifference in risk taking, Loewenstein et al. (2001) identify women\u2019s higher \nlevel of fear as particularly relevant.  The relationship between sex, fear and \nrisk assessment has been examined in relation to the 9\/11 terrorist attacks on \nthe United States (Lerner, Gonzalez, Small, & Fischhoff, 2003). Replicating \nprevious work, fear increased risk assessment while anger diminished it. \n 15\nFemales reported greater fear and lower anger than males and their risk \nestimates (with respect to the nation, the average American and themselves) \nwere higher. Differences in fear and anger explained 61 per cent of the effect \nof sex on risk evaluation. \nThere are two sources of direct evidence that fear mediates the \nmagnitude of sex differences in aggression.  Eagly and Steffen (1986) had \n200 judges rate 63 experimental studies on a 15-point scale in terms of \u201cHow \nmuch danger you would face if you enacted this behavior?\u201d.  Female judges \nrated danger as significantly higher than male judges and sex differences in \naggression were larger to the extent that women estimated that they would \nface more danger than males (beta = .41). Danger-to-self entered as the \nstrongest predictor in a multivariate regression testing six variables \n(beta=.38). The amplifying effect of danger on the magnitude of sex \ndifferences was strongest in situations where there was freedom of choice to \naggress (beta = -.56).  Bettencourt and Miller (1996) also found significant sex \ndifferences in danger judgements and again effect sizes for aggression were \nlarger where female judges perceive greater danger than males (beta = .18).  \nThe authors concluded that this was \u201cespecially interesting given that (a) \nexperimental inductions were objectively identical for male and female \nparticipants and (b) with few exceptions experimental paradigms provided little \nif any expectation that targets would have opportunities to retaliate\u201d \n(Bettencourt and Miller, 1996, p.440).  Faced with the same low level of \nobjective danger, women found the situation more dangerous and this \npredicted their lower level of aggression relative to men. \n 16\nIn summary, evidence from a variety of disciplines and methods \nsuggest that there are sex differences in fear.  These are evident self reports, \npsychometric inventories, reactions to real or hypothetical events and \nvulnerability to pathological fear.  The sex difference in fear accounts for a \nconsiderable portion of the differences observed in aggressive behavior.   \nInhibition. \nFear as a situated emotion can directly restrain aggressive behavior, \nbut we also have the capacity to inhibit aggression where there is no \nimmediate physical threat.  Despite provocation, we routinely inhibit \naggression as a function of target (children, old people, bosses), setting \n(aggression is more likely at a football game or nightclub than in our friends\u2019 \nhomes), and personal moral standards (our conception of ourselves as \n\u2018reasonable\u2019 people).   \nThis requires an examination of the literature on inhibition.  The \nconcept which has been widely used but incompletely specified and there is \nlittle consensus on a meaningful typology.  In organising this material (Figure \n1), I begin with an early-developing form of behavioral inhibition (reactive \ninhibition) that depends directly upon fear. I then consider two further forms, \nbuilt upon it, which appear later in development; effortful control which \nappears during the toddler stage and self control which appears in later \nchildhood or adolescence.  Developmentalists and clinicians have proposed \nthat individual differences at in each of these forms of inhibition constrain the \ndevelopment of later forms but that the attainment of effortful and social \ncontrol subsumes rather than supersedes reactive inhibition.  As a point of \ncomparison, I lastly consider cognitive inhibition, associated with executive \n 17\nfunction, which does not depend upon differences in fear (see Table 2).  I use \nthis developmental trajectory as a heuristic device; the focus is upon sex \ndifferences in each of these domains rather than the validity of the \ndevelopmental sequence.  \nReactive (fear-based) inhibition.  The proposal that behavioral inhibition \nrests on an infrastructure of fear is widespread. However this basic idea has \nbeen described using various terminologies and empirical assessments. In \nRothbart\u2019s developmental model of temperament (Rothbart & Bates, 1998), \nthe term \u2018reactive control\u2019 is used to describe the early-developing process \nwhereby fear \u2018automatically\u2019 drives attentional processes such that highly \nanxious individuals show enhanced attention to threats (Derryberry & Reed, \n1994, 1996). The positive feedback between individual differences in fear and \nthese attentional biases results in the development of cognitive \nrepresentations that are differentially sensitised to threat.  Reactive control is \ndescribed as a passive or involuntary system that is later complemented by \neffortful control. This model shares much with Block and Block\u2019s (1980) \nconcept of an early developing ego control which forms the basis for later ego \nresiliency (see also Fox et al. 2005)  \nIn the behaviorist paradigm, conscience and the passive avoidance \nassociated with it, has been seen as a conditioned response to fear \n(Dienstbier, 1984; Eysenck 1977; Mowrer 1960).  Individuals who are \ntemperamentally low in fear are likely to be relatively insensitive to aversive \nconditioning during socialization and less likely to show inhibition of \naggressive behavior (Raine, 1997).  Gray\u2019s (1982) influential approach-\navoidance theory of motivation is based on the relative strength of the BIS \n 18\n(behavioral inhibition system) and the BAS (behavioral activation system) with \nBIS having the capacity to override BAS activation in the face of threat.  \nStimuli that have been conditioned to punishment or frustrative nonreward \nactivate the BIS which inhibits behavior, increases arousal and allocates \nattention to relevant threats in the environment. Individuals with BIS systems \nthat are under-responsive, relative to the BAS, are likely to exhibit disinhibited \nbehavior.  They are predicted to have particular difficulties with passive rather \nthan active avoidance situations since the deficit specifically affects behavioral \ninhibition rather than activation. \nFrom a neuropsychological perspective, Davidson (Davidson & Irwin, \n1999; Davidson, Jackson & Kalin, 2000; Davidson, Putnam & Larson, 2000) \nproposes that fear, which triggers amygdala activation, also increases activity \nin the orbitofrontal and ventromedial areas of the prefrontal cortex, \nresponsible for modulating  a variety of negative emotions, including fear and \nanger (Liberzon, Zubieta, Fig, Phan, Koeppe & Taylor 2002).  The prefrontal \ncortex has a high density of serotonin receptors, implicated in the inhibition of \nimpulsive aggression (Miczek, Weerts, Haney, & Tidey, 1994; Niehoff, 1999) \nand it is suggested that impulsive aggression is associated with a \u201ca failure to \nrespond appropriately to the anticipated negative consequences of behaving \naggressively\u201d (Davidson, Putnam and Larson, 2000, p. 591).  This absence of \ncontrol may originally derive from under-responsive fear registration by the \namygdala (Blair, 2004; Mitchell, Colledge, Leonard & Blair, 2002).    \nA considerable volume of research has successfully explored these \nideas in relation to psychopathy demonstrating lower resting EDA, weaker \nEDA responses to aversive conditioning paradigms, poor passive avoidance \n 19\nlearning, slow resting heart rate, smaller amygdala volume and diminished \namygdala response to negatively valenced words, such as \u201chate\u201d (Fowles, \n1993, 1994; Hare, 1978; Kiehl, Smith, Hare, Mendrek, Forster, Brink et al., \n2001; Lorber, 2004; Raine 1993, 1997; Tiihonen, Hodgins, Vaurio, Laakso, \nRepo, Soininen et al., 2000).  Are similar deficits seen with respect to \naggression in non-clinical populations?  \nEisenberg has examined Rothbart\u2019s reactive control (which she terms \nlow \u201cimpulsivity\u201d) in her work on externalizing problems.  Reactive control is \nmeasured chiefly by adult ratings on the Child Behavior Questionnaire or the \nBlock and Block Q-sort.  In these studies, association between low reactive \ncontrol and externalizing problems have been found both concurrently and \npredictively in children and adolescents (Eisenberg, Cumberland, Spinrad, \nFabes, Shepard, Reiser et al., 2001; Eisenberg, Spinrad, Fabes, Reiser, \nCumberland, Shepard et al., 2004; Eisenberg, Sadovsky, Fabes, Losoya, \nValiente, Reiser et al., 2005; Oldehinkel, Hartman, de Winter, Veenstra & \nOrmel, 2004;  Valiente, Eisenberg, Smith, Fabes, Losoya, Guthrie et al., \n2003).  Although reactive and effortful control (see below) are correlated at \nbetween r= -.47 and r= -. 53, the former nonetheless makes an independent \ncontribution to models of externalizing problems, especially at younger ages.   \nLow resting heart rate has been found to be concurrently and \npredictively associated with antisocial behavior, after controlling for a variety \nof confounds such as height, weight, drug use, motor activity and \npsychosocial adversity (Raine, 2002).  Raine (1996) reported an effect size of \nd = .56 over 29 studies, with a similar magnitude in females, d = .63, and \nmales, d = .50.  In a sample of 16 studies specifically examining aggression, a \n 20\nlower but significant estimate of d = -.38 was given by Lorber (2004).  During \npresentation of negatively-valenced stimuli, heart rate was lower among more \naggressive individuals, d= -.23.  Although aggression showed weak \nconditional associations or none at all with electrodermal activity in his \nanalysis, some studies which have employed EDA reactivity as an \nindependent variable have found longitudinal associations with later \naggression (Fowles, 2000). \nExamination of the role of medial and orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex \n(jointly referred to as ventromedial PFC) in reactive control of aggression has \nemployed the Iowa Gambling Task (Bechara et al., 2000). Participants draw \ncards one at a time from four decks.  Each card either awards or demands \nmoney. Two of the four decks are \u2018good\u2019 choices (lower immediate gain but \nsmaller future losses i.e. a long term gain) while two are \u2018bad\u2019 (high immediate \ngain but larger future losses i.e. a long term loss).  Patients with damage to \nthe ventromedial cortex show a marked failure to avoid the \u2018bad\u2019 decks in \ncomparison with normal and brain-damaged controls, despite the fact that \nthese subjects perform normally on the Wisconsin Card Sort which assays \ndorsolateral function.  Control participants show a change in skin conductance \nprior to selecting a card from one of the less favourable packs while patients \nwith VM lesions show such a change after, but not before, such a selection \n(Bechara, Tranel, Damasio & Damsio, 1996).  This suggests that the VM-PFC \nmay be responsible for anticipatory somatic markers (Damasio, 1994) or for \nthe selection of appropriate responses to conditioned and unconditioned \nstimuli (Rolls, 1996).  Violent, but not non-violent, offenders (Fishbein, 2000), \npatients with intermittent explosive disorder (Best, Williams & Coccaro, 2002) \n 21\nand boys and men with psychopathic tendencies (Blair, Colledge & Mitchell, \n2001; van Honk, Hermans, Putman, Montagne & Schutter, 2002) similarly fail \nto avoid the \u2018bad\u2019 packs.  Studies have supported the role of the orbitofrontal \nand the ventromedial cortices in inhibiting aggressive behavior in humans \n(Giancola & Zeichner, 1994a; Grafman, Schwab, Warden, Pridgen, Brown & \nSalazar, 1996; Lapierre, Braun & Hodgings, 1995). Stimulation of these areas \ninhibits anger and aggression, while corresponding lesions increase \nbehavioral aggression and disinhibition.  Murderers show lower glucose \nmetabolism in these regions compared to non-violent controls (Raine, \nBuchsbaum, Stanely, Lottenberg, Abel & Stoddard, 1994; Raine, Buchsbaum \n& LaCasse, 1997).   \nTo what extent are sex differences found in fear-based inhibition?  In \ndevelopmental studies of reactive control, consistent sex differences favouring \ngirls have been found (Eisenberg et al. 2001; Eisenberg et al. 2004; \nEisenberg et al. 2005; Kockanska & Knaack, 2003; Oldehinkel et al. 2004; \nValiente et al. 2003). There are marked sex differences in resting heart rate \nthe general population with males showing lower resting rates from the age of \nabout 3 years (Raine, 2002).  In women, a single administration of \ntestosterone is followed by cardiac acceleration to angry faces, associated \nwith low levels of elicited fear and a willingness to attack (Van Honk, Tuiten, \nHermans, Putman, Kopeschaar, Thijssen et al., 2001).   \nThe Iowa Gambling Task, have produced especially interesting results. \nTypically the dependent variable is the average percentage of \u201ccorrect\u201d (i.e. \nlong-term beneficial) card choices over blocks of trails.  Using this measure, \nevidence for sex differences has been mixed (Hooper, Luciana, Conklin & \n 22\nYarger, 2004; Kerr & Zelazo, 2004; Overman, 2004).  But when the \ndependent variable is altered to the proportion of times a choice is made from \ndecks bearing a lower percentage of loss cards (i.e. packs bearing few minus \nsigns), women exceed men (Hooper et al., 2004; Overman, 2004).  Women \nappear to systematically avoid the packs that more frequently contain \npenalties suggesting that women are more acutely avoidant of penalising \nstimuli.  Recall that research on decision-making under uncertainty, discussed \nearlier, shows that fear is insensitive to probability variation (Loewenstein et \nal., 2001).  Furthermore, when presented with threatening stimuli, adults make \ndecisions based on short-term outcomes rather than possible long-term \nconsequences (Gray, 1999). If negative stimuli arouse a stronger amygdala \nresponse in females, estimation of long-term net outcomes may be over-\nridden.   \nVolumetric MRI studies of the amygdala have produced inconsistent \nresults of sex differences with reports of larger volume in boys and men \n(Caviness, Kennedy, Richelme, Rademacher & Filipek 1996; Giedd, Snell, \nLange, Rajapakse, Casey, Kozuch et al., 1996; Goldstein, Seidman, Horton, \nMakris, Kennedy, Caviness et al., 2001), larger volumes in women (van Elst, \nWoermann, Lemieux & Trimble, 2000) and no sex difference (Gur, Gunning-\nDixon, Bilker & Gur, 2002).  Larger frontomedial (Goldstein et al., 2001) and \norbitofrontal (Gur et al., 2002) cortices have been found in women, although \ntwo studies which failed to adjust for intracranial volume found no sex \ndifference (Raz, Gunning, Head, Dupois, Mc Quain, McQuain et al., 1997; \nSzeszko, Bilder, Lencz, Pollack, Alvir, Ashitari et al., 1999).  Interpreting their \nfinding of greater female orbitofrontal volume in tandem with equal amygdala \n 23\nvolumes, Gur et al. (2002, p.1001-2) suggest that \u201cwomen have greater tissue \nvolume available for modulating amygdala input.  This finding may explain sex \ndifferences in emotional behavior, particularly aggression\u201d.  Serotonin has \nbeen implicated in inhibitory control of aggression and women\u2019s 5-HT binding \npotential has been found to exceed men\u2019s in a number of brain regions \nincluding the frontal cortex, orbital and medial PFC, and the amygdala (Biver, \nLotstra, Monclus, Wikler, Damhaut, Mendlewicz et al., 1996; Parsey, \nOquendo, Simpson, Ogden, Van Heertum, Arango et al., 2002).   \nThe amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex are involved in the \nrecognition of facial emotion, especially fear and anger (Adolphs, 2002; Zald, \n2003).  Females are more accurate than males in decoding facial expressions \nin infancy2, d = -.25, childhood and adolescence, d = -.13 and adulthood, d = -\n.32 (Hall, 1978, 1984; McClure, 2000).  Despite this, surprisingly few \nneuroimaging studies have examined sex differences (Adolphs, 2002).  \nDifferences that have been reported are small and not yet firmly replicated \n(Kesler-West, Andersen, Smith, Avison, Davis, Kryscio et al., 2001; Killgore & \nYurgelun-Todd, 2001).  Unambiguously threatening faces trigger greater \nactivation in the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex in women compared to \nmen or adolescents of either sex (McClure, Monk, Nelson, Zarahn, Leibenluft, \nBilder et al., 2004).  Fearful faces also trigger increased activation in the \nprefrontal cortex of adult women but not men despite the fact that during \nchildhood levels of amygdala activation are similar in both sexes (Killgore, Oki \n& Yurgelun-Todd, 2001).  Other studies have reported  a similar pattern of \n                                                 \n2 Throughout (and in keeping with predominant usage) a negative effect sizes \nindicate that females score higher than males. In some cases, I have added a \nminus sign to bring the reported results in line with this convention.  \n 24\nsmall childhood differences (Thomas, Drevets, Whalen, Eccard, Dahl, Ryan et \nal., 2001) followed by a female post-pubertal shift to greater greater frontal \nlobe activity (Idiaka, Okada, Murata, Omori, Kosaka, Sadato et al., 2001).  \nInteresting results that directly address inhibition of aggression have \ncome from an inventive PET study in which participants were asked to vividly \nimagine a series of events associated with aggression (Pietrini, Guazzelli, \nBasso, Jaffe & Grafman, 2000).  In the baseline condition, participants \nimagined an elevator ride with their mother and two men. They were also \nasked to imagine that the two men assaulted their mother while they simply \nwatched (cognitive restraint), that they were held by one of the men and \nprevented from assisting their mother (physical restraint) and that they were \nable to attack the men with all their strength (unrestrained aggression).    \nDuring the three conditions involving aggressive content, the subjects showed \nsignificant rCBF decreases in the medial orbitofrontal cortex compared to the \nneutral condition with the largest changes occurred in the unrestrained \naggression condition.  Under cognitive restrain, there was significantly greater \nrCBF bilaterally in the medial frontal gyri suggesting that \u201cfunctional \ndeactivation of these frontal cortical areas was strongest when subjects were \ninstructed to express rather than to try to inhibit their aggressive behavior\u201d \n(Pietrini et al., 2000, p. 1777; see also Blair, Morris, Frith, Perett & Dolan, \n1999; Dougherty, Shin, Alpert, Pitman, Orr, Lasko, Macklin, Fischman & \nRauch, 1999). Unrestrained aggression also showed increases in limbic \nsystem activation, heart rate and systolic blood pressure that were inversely \ncorrelated with medial frontal activity.  Congruent with earlier studies, limbic \nsystem activity was greater in women (Pietrini, Guazzelli & Grafman, 1998; \n 25\nPietrini, Guazzelli, Jaffe, Sandhu & Grafman, 1998) and women also showed \ngreater deactivation in the OFC than men (Ricciardi, 2004) indicating stronger \ndisinhibition when taking (imagined) aggressive action.   \nEffortful control.  Following the early manifestation of reactive control, \nDerryberry and Rothbart (1997) describe the later development of effortful \ncontrol (\u201cthe ability to inhibit a dominant response to perform a subdominant \nresponse\u201d, Rothbart & Bates, 1998, p. 137).  This second system of control \ndevelops during the toddler period providing a form of self-regulation that goes \nbeyond the reactive impact of fear.  With age, effortful control explains more of \nthe variance in children\u2019s social behavior than reactive control in line with its \nincreasing power to modulate behavior (Eisenberg et al., 2001; Murphy, \nEisenberg, Fabes, Shepard & Guthrie 1999).  Effortful control operates \nthrough conscious selective attention and, while it can theoretically be \nmobilised to oppose the dominant underlying motivational system, it more \nusually works to enhance it: A child low in reactive fear is unlikely to effortfully \ndirect attention to threatening cues in the environment. (Derryberry & \nRothbart, 1997, p.648).  Fearfulness has been empirically linked to better \neffortful control (Kockanska, Coy & Murray, 2001; Kockanska & Knaack, \n2003).     \nAlthough the definition of effortful control appears to some (Carlson, \n2003) to overlap with executive inhibition, Posner and Rothbart (2000) \nemphasise that it this form of control is temperamental rather than cognitive.  \nWhile executive inhibition addresses the cognitive ability to focus attention on \na single dimension of a task and to ignore competing stimuli (see below), \neffortful control centres on the child\u2019s competence in controlling their behavior; \n 26\n\u201cthe skills inherent in effortful control are used to regulate emotion and \nbehavior associated with emotion\u201d (Liew, Eisenberg & Reiser, 2004, p. 300).  \nIt has been operationalized behaviorally as the child\u2019s ability to follow \nexperimenter instructions in a variety of tasks requiring them to inhibit their \npreferred response or by parent or teacher report on the Child Behavior \nChecklist.  Effortful control is positively associated with a variety of moral \nbehaviors, including restraint from touching forbidden objects and resistance \nto cheating in games (Kochanska, Murray, Jacques, Koenig & Vandegeest, \n1996; Kochanska, Murray & Coy, 1997).  Negative relationships, both \nconcurrent and prospective, between effortful control and eternalising \nbehaviors including aggression have been frequently reported (Eisenberg, \nFabes, Guthrie, Murphy, Maszk, Holmgren et al., 1996; Eisenberg, Guthrie, \nFabes, Shepard, Loyola, Murphy et al., 2000; Eisenberg et al., 2005; Gilliom, \nShaw, Beck, Schonberg & Lukon, 2002; Kochanska & Knaack, 2003; \nKochanska, Murray & Harlan, 2000; Murray & Kochanska 2002;  Oldehinkel et \nal., 2004; Rothbart & Bates 1998; Ruff & Rothbart, 1996; Valiente et al. 2003).   \nA number studies have confirmed girls superiority in complying with \nadult proscriptions. Maccoby and Jacklin (1974) concluded that girls show \nhigher levels of obedience. Recent work on effortful control has consistently \nsubstantiated this conclusion (Eisenberg et al., 2001; Eisenberg et al., 2004; \nGervai, Turner & Hinde, 1993; Kochanska & Aksan, 1995; Kochanska et al., \n2001; Kochanska & Knaack, 2003; Kochanska et al., 2000; Kochanska et al., \n1997; Kochanska et al., 1996; Liew et al., 2004, Olson, Schilling & Bates, \n1999; Valiente et al. 2003).  Bjorklund and Kipp\u2019s (1996) narrative review of \nchildhood sex differences in resistance to temptation, found a moderate \n 27\nfemale advantage with 6 out of 11 studies favouring girls.   A quantitative \nreview of 98 studies investigating resistance to temptation found only a weak \neffect size, d = -.06, favouring females (Silverman, 2003a3).  However this \nanalysis included studies of cheating in examinations or tests, an active and \ninstrumental behavior to a temporally remote goal rather than a failure to \nsuppress an immediately attractive behavior.  When studies investigating \nresistance to touching a forbidden object were considered, a much stronger \neffect size, d = -.41, was found favouring girls.  \nSelf control \/ Impulsivity.  While impulsivity has been defined in a \nbewildering number of ways (Evendon, 1999), it is broadly accepted to be a \ntendency to act on the spur of the moment, without consideration of long-term \nconsequences. Hirschi (1969) proposed that the attractions of antisocial \nbehavior are immediate and evident, and that desistance not involvement \nrequires explanation.  Among children, social control is normally imposed by \nfamilies, schools and other institutions. By adolescence, this externally-\nexerted control becomes internalized as self control.  Antisocial and criminal \nbehavior is proposed to result from low self-control in interaction with \nsituational opportunities (Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1990).  Following their initial \nconceptualization, self-control has been operationalized chiefly as a \ncombination of impulsivity, risk seeking, present orientation, temper, and \ncarelessness in psychometric instruments.  Their proposal has been tested in \ntwenty-one empirical studies with over 49,727 participants.  The effect size3 \nfound for low self-control, d = .41, ranks as \"one of the strongest known \ncorrelates of crime\u201d (Pratt & Cullen, 2000, p.952) and is unaffected by the \n                                                 \n3  The effect size in the original article is given as r but has been converted to \nd  to maintain continuity with other effect sizes reported. \n 28\nmeasure used to assess self-control.  Although the items employed on self-\ncontrol questionnaires have generally been found to be unidimensional across \nand within sex (Grasmick, Tittle, Bursik & Arneklev, 1993; LaGrange & \nSilverman, 1999; Piquero & Rosay, 1998, but see Longshore, Turner & Stein, \n1996), the impulsivity and risk seeking subscales have been found to be \nalmost as predictive as the full scale (Arneklev, Grasmick, Tittle & Bursik, \n1993; Deschenes & Esbensen 1999; Nakhaie, Silverman & LaGrange, 2000; \nPiquero & Rosay, 1998; Wood, Pfefferbaum & Areneklev, 1993). \nImpulsivity forms a key part of Moffitt\u2019s (1993) account of the etiology of \ndelinquent behavior.  She proposes that persistent involvement in antisocial \nand violent behavior stems from impulsivity which results from the confluence \nof early neuropsychological problems, difficult child behavior and poor \nparenting skills.  Although impulsivity was seen as the behavioral \nmanifestation of the child\u2019s executive and verbal neurological dysfunction, a \nstudy which examined the factor structure of a variety of impulsivity tasks \nfound that it was behavioral rather than cognitive impulsivity that correlated \nmost highly with delinquency (White, Moffitt, Caspi, Bartusch, Needles & \nStouthamer-Loeber, 1994; see also Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter & Silva, 2001).   \nVulnerable children who experience inconsistent parenting practices are less \nlikely to achieve effortful compliance with parental demands.  Such effortful \ncontrol may form the basis for, and be internalised as, self control or low \nimpulsivity.  In longitudinal studies, impulsivity has been found to be predictive \nof offending in both the United States and England (Farrington & Loeber, \n1999).  Impulsivity is prospectively predictive of violent offending (Farrington, \n 29\n2003; Henry, Caspi, Moffitt & Silva, 1996) and is more closely related to \nstranger violence than to partner violence (Krueger, Caspi & Moffitt, 2000).  \nPsychometrically, impulsivity has been measured with a wide variety of \ninstruments.  Data collected using 21 such scales from nine inventories have \nrevealed four factors (Whiteside & Lynam, 2001) that have been replicated \nusing confirmatory factor analysis (Lynam & Miller, 2004).  The factors are; \nLack pf Premeditation (a tendency to act without reflection), Urgency \n(tendency to act rashly when under experiencing negative affect), Sensation \nSeeking (seeking exciting and adventurous activities) and Lack of \nPerseverance (maintaining attention on a task).  The first two of these \ncorresponds to impulsivity as here conceptualised.   Lack of premeditation \nand urgency, weakly inter-correlated at r = .28, are more strongly associated \nwith self reported aggressive and delinquent acts than the other two \nimpulsivity scales (Miller, Flory, Lynam & Leukfeld, 2003).  Lack of \npremeditation is associated with both selecting and enacting an aggressive \nresponse while urgency is more closely associated with a hostile attribution \nbias (Lynam & Miller, 2004).  Relations are as strong for women as for men.    \nSex differences have been found in tests of self-control theory (Burton, \nCullen, Evans, Alarid & Dunaway, 1998; La Grange & Silverman, 1999; \nNakhaie et al., 2000; Tittle, Ward & Grasmick, 2003) and these seem to be \nespecially pronounced for the subscales of impulsivity and risk seeking \n(LaGrange & Silverman, 1999).  Self control eliminates or significantly reduces \nthe effect of sex on general and violent offending (Burton et al. 1998; Gibbs, \nGiever & Martin, 1998; La Grange & Silverman, 1999).  In a longitudinal New \nZealand study (Moffitt et al., 2001), boys age 5-11 were higher then girls on \n 30\nhyperactivity (including impulsivity) measured by both parents\u2019 reports, d = \n.25, and teachers\u2019 reports, d = .54.  Childhood hyperactivity explained 35 per \ncent of the sex difference in adolescent antisocial behavior.  By age 18, \nninety-six per cent of the sex differences in adolescent anti-social behavior \ncould be explained by scores on two MPQ higher order personality traits; \nNegative Emotionality and Constraint (defined as an inability to modulate \nimpulsive expression).  Constraint showed a very significant sex difference, d \n=.-59. The correlation between Constraint and self-reported delinquency was \nidentical for both sexes, r=-.44 (Caspi, Moffitt, Silva, Stouthamer-Loeber, \nKrueger & Schmutte, 1994, see also Miller & Lynam, 2001).      \nHowever, sex differences among undergraduates on Whiteside and \nLynam\u2019s (2001) four factor model of impulsivity are weak, with the exception \nof Sensation seeking, d = .60, on which males score higher (Lynam, 2005).  \nInternational data using Zuckerman\u2019s sensation seeking scale also show a \nmarked sex difference in the male direction (Roberti, 2004; Zuckerman, 1994).   \nSensation seeking assesses a positive appetite for risky activities rather than \nan inability or unwillingness to control impulsive expression.  This raises two \npossibilities about how sensation seeking might mediate the sex-aggression \nrelationship.  The first is directly congruent with a fear-based proposal.  \nSensation-seeking is negatively associated with risk appraisal and fear \n(Roberti, 2004).  Individuals with high sensation seeking scores evaluate a \nrange of activities including criminal behavior as less risky (Horvath & \nZuckerman, 1993).  High sensation seeking is also associated with a less \nthreatening interpretation of fear-eliciting objects and situations (Franken, \nGibson & Rowland, 1992). Hence sex differences in sensation seeking may \n 31\ndirectly reflect underlying differences in fear.  If so, the current argument that \nfear and fear-based inhibition explain sex differences in aggression remains \nplausible.   \nHowever sensation seeking has also been conceptualised in terms of \nbehavioral compensation for underarousal (Eysenck, 1997; Raine, 2002; \nZuckerman, 1994).  For individuals with relatively stronger parasympathetic \nand \/ or weaker sympathetic nervous system reactivity, maximum hedonic \ntone is experienced at higher levels of stimulation relative to the population at \nlarge.   Low arousal as measured by heart rate is associated with antisocial \nbehavior and females have higher heart rates then males (see Reactive fear-\nbased inhibition).  Underarousal may be phenomenologically experienced as \nboredom due to lack of external stimulation and men show significantly higher \nrates of boredom proneness (Dahlen, Martin, Ragan & Kuhlman, 2004; Lynam \n2005).  Men\u2019s greater involvement in aggressive behavior may reflect not a \nlack of impulse control but a higher threshold for the point at which stimulation \nturns from hedonic to dysphoric.  The escalation of a verbal argument would, \nin this model, become distressing to women at a much earlier point than it \nwould to men, resulting in earlier submission, withdrawal or emotional \noverload, such as crying.  In this model, the role of fear is more indirect, acting \nto alter preferred or tolerable levels of arousal. Further research could usefully \npit these two potential mediators of the sex-aggression relationship against \none another. \nPreference for a smaller immediate reward rather than a more valuable \ndelayed reward has been taken by some to be a behavioral measure of \nimpulsivity (Evendon, 1999).  Impulsivity is thus conceived of as a problem \n 32\nwith the ability to delay gratification.  Delay of gratification is uncorrelated with \nresistance to temptation (Toner, Holstein & Hetherington, 1977) and cognitive \ninhibition tasks (Olson, Schilling & Bates, 1999; Solanto, Abikoff, Sonuga-\nBarke, Schachar, Logan, Wigal et al., 2001; Swann, Bjork, Moeller & \nDougherty, 2002).  Criminals are argued to show a steeper time discounting \nfunction preferring immediate to delayed rewards and particularly discounting \nfuture aversive events such as punishment (Wilson & Herrnstein, 1985).  Male \nand female parolees with a history of violent crimes choose more immediate \nrewards (Cherek, Moeller, Dougherty & Rhoades, 1997; Cherek & Lane \n1999).  Preference for immediate reward is highly correlated with performance \non a laboratory measure of aggression, the Point Subtraction Paradigm \n(Cherek et al., 1997).  Immediate smaller rewards are more often selected by \nIndividuals low in premeditation and this same trait is significantly associated \nwith higher aggression (Lynam & Miller, 2004).  In children also, delay of \ngratification has been shown to be associated with aggression and delinquent \nbehavior (Mischel, Shoda & Rodriguez, 1989).   \nWith regard to sex differences, Bjorklund and Kipp (1996) concluded \nthat there was a weak female advantage in delay of gratification studies. \nSilverman (2003b3) subsequently reviewed 33 studies of delay of gratification \nconfirming a small effect size favouring women, d = -.12.  Using preferences \nfor immediate or delayed lottery payouts, Kirby and Marakovic (1996, see also \nKirby & Marakovic, 1995) found that men discounted delayed rewards more \nsteeply than women suggesting greater impulsivity in men.   \nExecutive function inhibition.  Executive functions are largely, but not \nexclusively, associated with the dorsolateral region of the frontal lobes.  They \n 33\ninclude attention, concentration, reasoning, concept formation, formulating \ngoals, anticipation, planning, programming and initiating sequences of \nbehavior, self-monitoring, self awareness, inhibition of unsuccessful, \ninappropriate or impulsive behaviors, interruption of behavior and shifts to \nmore adaptive alternative behaviors (Henry & Moffitt, 1997, p. 281).  These \nfunctions appear to encompass virtually every process required for goal-\ndirected, intelligent and integrated behavior.  Given their ubiquity, they have \nbeen implicated in a very wide variety of syndromes including depression, \nobsessive compulsive disorder, neurofibromatosis, effects of preterm birth, \nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, alcoholism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, spina bifida and \nalcoholism. \nThey have been intensively examined in relation to disinhibitory and \nexternalizing disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct \ndisorder, antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy. A meta-analysis of \nstudies using six commonly-used EF tests (Morgan & Lilienfeld, 2000) found \nmodest effect sizes for clinical syndromes (ASPD, d= .08; CD d = .36 and \npsychopathy, d= .25) but more marked effects for criminality, d= .94, and \ndelinquency, d = .78.  Are similar relationships found for aggression in non-\nclinical populations?  \n  A number of studies have reported associations between poorer EF \nperformance and aggression (Hughes, White, Sharpen and Dunn, 2000; Lau, \nPihl & Peterson, 1995; Seguin, Arsenault, Boulerice, Harden and Tremblay, \n2002; Seguin, Pihl, Harden, Tremblay & Boulerice, 1995; Stanford, Greve & \nGerstle, 1997). However the tasks used to assess EF correlate very highly, r > \n.90, with the g factor of general intelligence (Kane, Hambrick & Conway, 2005; \n 34\nKyllonen, 1996).  Debate continues as to whether EF and IQ are essentially \nthe same construct and, if not, the role of EF in facilitating performance on \nvarious IQ tests (Ackerman, Beier & Boyle 2005; Blair, in press).   Whatever \nthe outcome, it is clearly important to control for IQ because it has shown \nconsistent associations with antisocial behavior (Lynam, Moffitt & Stouthamer-\nLauber, 1993) and with aggression (Giancola & Zeichner, 1994b).  \nStudies which have systematically controlled for IQ have used two \nmeasures of EF: the Self Ordered Pointing task (SOP), which assesses the \nability to organise, plan and monitor a sequence of responses and the \nConditional Association Task (CAT), which assesses the ability to learn a \nseries of conditional associations between unrelated stimuli.  Like most EF \ntasks, they tap cognitive rather than behavioral impulsivity:  While the \noutcome measure necessarily involves a motor response the focus of interest \nis the ability to control cognitive processes, chiefly sustained attention and \nmemory.  Combining these two measures, Hoaken, Shaughnessy and Pihl \n(2003) designated participants as low or high quartile EF scorers.  Because \nthere was a significant between-group difference in IQ, this was used as a \ncovariate in the analysis.  Low EF individuals gave higher shock intensities in \nthe Taylor Aggression Paradigm although the experimental design does not \nallow examination of the relative contribution of the two tasks.  Giancola and \nZeichner (1994b) found no relationship between aggression and SOP.  But \nwhen IQ and SOP performance were controlled, there was a significant \nrelationship between CAT errors and aggression.  Using similar measures, \nSeguin, Boulerice, Harden, Tremblay & Pihl (1999) found that the CAT task \nproduced an anomalous pattern in which unstable-aggressive boys performed \n 35\nmore poorly than both stable aggressive and non-aggressive boys.  These \nlatter two groups did not differ when IQ and general memory were controlled.  \nHowever the SOP revealed both aggressive groups to do worse than non-\naggressive boys after controlling for IQ and general memory.  Some of these \nparticipants were tested again at age 20 (Seguin, Nagin, Assaad & Tremblay, \n2004).  The young men were classified into low and high aggression trajectory \ngroups and EF was assessed by SOP, CAT and Number Randomisation. \nThere were significant between group differences on all three EF tests, even \nafter controlling for IQ and general memory.  However these controls \n\u201cconsiderably attenuated\u201d the relationship (Sequin et al., 2004, p.609). \nCapacity to focus attention has emerged from factor analytic studies of \npsychometric impulsivity (White et al., 1994; Whiteside & Lynam, 2001).  The \nassociation between this factor and aggression has been non-significant \n(Lynam & Miller, 2004) or considerably weaker than behavioral impulsivity \nmeasures (White et al., 1994). In this latter study, cognitive impulsivity, unlike \nbehavioral impulsivity, was unrelated to antisocial behavior when IQ was \ncontrolled (Loeber, Farrington, Stouthamer-Loeber, Moffitt, Caspi & Lynam, \n2001).   \nThe marked sex differences in disinhibitory pathologies and in \ncriminality have suggested to some commentators the possibility of a sex \ndifference in underlying executive function (Paschall & Fishbein, 2002).  Few \nstudies have examined sex differences in EF performance in the normal \npopulation and most have been performed on children.  Sex differences have \nnot been found using the parent-report Children\u2019s Executive Functions Scale \n(Navarette, Goulden & Silver, 1998).  The Continuous Performance Test \n 36\n(which requires participants to press a button when a designated letter \nappears on the screen) has produced inconsistent results (Greenberg & \nWaldman 1993; Kirchner & Kopf, 1974; Levy & Hobbes, 1979).   While boys \nshow faster reaction times, they do not generally achieve greater accuracy \n(Pascualvaca, Anthony, Arnold, Rebok, Ahearn, Kelam et al., 1997; Rebok, \nSmith, Pascualavaca, Mirsky, Anthony & Kellam, 1997) and Finnish girls aged \n3-12 performed better than boys on an auditory Continuous Performance \nTask with a markedly higher cognitive load (Klenberg, Korkman & Lahti-\nNuuttila, 2001).  The Digit Cancellation task appears to favour girls at 7-8 \nyears who show faster completion times and fewer errors (Pasculavaca et al. \n1997). Girls also outperform boys on a visual attention task (analogous to \nDigit Cancellation) in a Finnish sample of 3-12 year olds (Klenberg et al., \n2001).  However between the ages of 10 and 13, while girls continue to \ncomplete the task more quickly, there are no differences in accuracy (Rebok \net al. 1997). No sex differences are found in children on the Wisconsin Card \nSort Test (Pasculavaca et al. 1997; Rebok et al. 1997) or on the Tower of \nLondon test (Klenberg et al. 2001).  Among adults, using the Tower of Hanoi, \nmen show lower number of moves (Leon-Carrion, Morales, Forastero, \nDominguez-Morales, Murillo, Jimenes-Baco et al., 1991), shorter move \nlatency and fewer illegal moves (Ronnlund, Lovden & Nilsson, 2001).  WISC \nsubtest measures are taken by some to be tests of EF.  While girls and boys \nperform similarly on arithmetic and digit span subtest of the WISC, girls \nachieve higher scores on the coding subtest (Pasualavaca et al. 1997; Barr \n2003).  In general, sex differences appear to be absent, weak or inconsistent \non EF tests. To the extent that such tasks correlate highly with or are used as \n 37\nmeasures of IQ, the inconsistency and weakness of sex differences is \nperhaps not surprising.   \nSummary. \nIn developmental studies, reactive control is associated with \naggression and externalizing disorders and girls show consistent evidence of \nsuperior control.  In terms of physiological reactivity, aggression is associated \nwith a lower resting heart rate (but not weaker electrodermal activity) and \nheart rate is lower in men than in women in community samples. Orbitofrontal \nand ventromedial regions of the prefrontal cortex are associated with reactive \ninhibition of aggression. Although studies of sex differences have not been \nconclusive, there is some preliminary evidence that women may have greater \norbitofrontal volume and a higher density of serotonin receptors associated \nwith the modulation of emotion.  Frontal activity, assayed by the IGT, is \nassociated with aggression. Although sex differences have not been found on \nthe traditional dependent measure, some studies have found that women are \ndifferentially sensitive to and avoidant of penalties.   \nDevelopmental studies that have simultaneously addressed both \neffortful control and externalizing \/ aggressive behavior have found an \nassociation and female superiority.  However to the extent that resistance to \ntemptation is an assay of effortful control, a much weaker female advantage \nhas been found. Criminological studies have found associations between low \nself control or high impulsivity and antisocial and aggressive behavior.  Sex \ndifferences in these measures mediate the magnitude of sex differences in \nantisocial behavior.  However using a psychometric instrument derived from \nestablished psychological measures of impulsivity, sex differences have not \n 38\nbeen found in undergraduate populations with the exception of the sensation \nseeking scale on which men score higher.  There have been only a few \nstudies of delay of gratification in relation to aggression: They are suggestive \nof a possible relationship but sex differences seem quite modest.   \nFew studies of aggression and executive function have controlled for \nIQ. Those that do, report some associations with aggression though these are \nnot always consistent.  Studies which have included measures of impulsivity \nas well as cognitive inhibition find a stronger relationship with aggression for \nthe former. Sex differences in executive function tasks among normal \npopulations are neither consistent nor strong.  \nCorrelates of fear and effortful control. \nBelow I briefly consider two ancillary domains, empathy and guilt, \nwhich are associated with fear, inhibition and aggression and which show \nsome evidence of sex differences.  Future work may reveal the temporal and \ncausal associations between these variables. \nEmpathy can be defined as an affective response that stems from the \napprehension or comprehension of another\u2019s emotional state or condition and \nis similar to what the other person is feeling or would be expected to feel \n(Eisenberg, 2000).  It has been proposed that empathic concern for another \nperson enhances the inhibition of aggressive behavior (Blackburn, 1993; \nDavis, 1996; Feshbach, 1978).  The neural structures subserving empathy \ninclude the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala (Grattan, Bloomer, Archambault \n& Eslinger, 1994; Spielberger, Johnson, Russell, Crane, Jacobs & Spinella, \n2002) and hence overlap with those involved in emotional recognition and \nregulation.  Greater empathy is associated with higher levels of fear and even \n 39\nmore strongly with effortful control (Rothbart, Ahadi & Hershey, 1994).  The \nrelationship is of equal strength for both sexes.   \nEmpathy is negatively related to aggression and antisocial externalizing \nproblems, although the effects are more marked for questionnaire methods as \ncompared to other indexes such as facial and gestural expressions, and \npicture and experimental inductions (Eisenberg, 2000; Miller & Eisenberg, \n1988).  Empathy is also lower among offenders, d = -.28, particularly violent \noffenders, d = -.39 (Jolliffe & Farrington, 2004) and the relationship appears to \nbe of equal magnitude for both sexes.   \nAmong children, girls demonstrate greater empathic concern for \nanother\u2019s distress whether measured by maternal report (Kochanska, DeVet, \nGoldman, Murray & Putnam, 1994) or behaviorally (Zahn-Waxler, Radke-\nYarrow, Wagner & Chapman 1992; Zahn-Waxler, Robinson & Emde, 1992).  \nSex differences in empathy have been found in experiments using self report \nmeasures but are less evident when physiological or nonverbal reactions are \nassessed (Eisenberg & Lennon, 1983).  Psychometric measures of empathy \nconsistently report a higher mean for female samples (e.g. Baron-Cohen & \nWheelwright, 2004; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1978).  Empathy forms a central \ncomponent of measures of nurturance and expressivity on which women \nscore higher than men (Hoyenga & Hoyenga, 1993).  Ickes, Gesn and \nGraham (2000) found an effect size, d = -.26, favouring women over fifteen \nstudies of empathic accuracy. However when they included only those studies \nthat cued the participant to the importance of accuracy, the effect size rose to \nd = -.56.   \n 40\nGuilt can be defined as an agitation-based emotion or painful feeling of \nregret when the actor actually causes, anticipates causing, or is associated \nwith an aversive event (Ferguson & Stegge, 1998, p.20).  It has been \ndistinguished from shame on the basis that the latter is more concerned with \nother\u2019s evaluation of the self as a whole and need not involve behavior that is \naversive to others (e.g. a poor public speaking performance).  Because these \ntwo concepts are not always operationally distinct, I will focus on guilt.  Guilt is \npositively correlated with empathy (Tangney, 1991; Tangney, Burggraf & \nWagner, 1995) and, like empathy, guilt is associated with both fear \n(Kochanska et al., 1994) and effortful control (Rothbart et al., 1994).    \nPreschoolers who exhibit signs of conscience are less prone to \ntransgressions (Kochanska et al., 1994) and these children, when implicated \nin contrived mishaps, showed affective and behavioral evidence of guilt \n(Kockanska, Casey & Fukumoto (1995).  Guilt is associated with lower levels \nof aggression (Tangney, Wagner, Hill-Barlow, Marschall & Gramzow, 1996).  \nVery low levels of guilt are associated with externalizing problems (Eisenberg, \n2000), conduct disorder (Cimbora & McIntosh, 2003), antisocial personality \ndisorder (Dinn & Harris, 2000) and psychopathy (Morrison & Gilbert, 2001). \nIn self report studies, women rate themselves as more likely to \nexperience guilt in response to hypothetical incidents than men (Ferguson & \nEyre, 2000). However fewer sex differences are found in studies that assess \nguilt intensity in response to real or hypothetical events, or the frequency of \nguilt in everyday life.  It is likely that the nature of the precipitating event may \nbe critical for sex differences: Ferguson and Eyre (2000, p.266) conclude that \n\u201cwomen see themselves as likelier to experience guilt than men for behaviors \n 41\nthat clearly contradict feminine gender roles (e.g., anger, aggression, being \ninconsiderate to others).\u201d  Preschool girls generally display greater distress \nthan boys after engaging in or witnessing aggression and this is confirmed by \nparental reports (Ferguson & Eyre, 2000).  Among both adults and children, \nsex differences have been found in social representations of aggression \nindicating that women, more than men, view aggression as a failure of self \ncontrol resulting in feelings of guilt (Campbell 1993; Campbell & Muncer \n1994).  Frodi, Macauley and Thome (1977) concluded that guilt about acts of \naggression is higher in women and is an important mediator the sex difference \nin aggression.    \nEagly and Steffen (1986) tested this proposal in their meta-analysis.  \nThey asked judges to rate each dependent variable used in the studies in \nterms of \u201cHow much anxiety or guilt would you feel if you enacted this \nbehavior?\u201d. The wording here is unfortunate because anxiety and guilt are not \nsynonymous and anxiety may have been interpreted to mean fear. This would \ncreate a confound between this analysis and their consideration of danger-to-\nself as a mediator.  Unfortunately, correlations between the judges\u2019 ratings of \ndanger and anxiety\/guilt are not reported but, when sex differences in both \nvariables were entered in a multivariate regression, the impact of anxiety\/guilt \ndiminished from beta=.38 in the univariate regression to beta=.30 suggesting \nonly a moderate confound.  Guilt and anxiety associated with aggression \nmade a significant contribution to explaining the magnitude of the sex \ndifference.  Female judges rated the participants\u2019 aggressive actions as \nsignificantly higher in anxiety\/guilt than did male judges. Nonetheless guilt \n 42\nmay vary as a function of the sex of the victim; men feel more guilt about \ncross-sex aggression than do women (Archer, 2000; Harris, 1994).   \nConclusions \nIf we conceive of aggression as a trade-off between impelling and \ninhibitory emotions, the sex difference does not appear to reside in the former.  \nFear inhibits aggression, shows sex differences and significantly explains the \nsex difference in aggression.  Researchers have noted that aggression \ndiminishes with age as inhibitory processes develop in childhood and \nadolescence (Tremblay & Nagin, 2005).  To the extent that these processes \nare built upon fear, they are critical in explaining aggression more generally \nand sex differences in particular.  The evidence presented here makes a \nprima facie case for sex differences in those forms of inhibition most closely \nallied to fear levels.  \nMethodological issues.  \nFirm conclusions about the present proposal must await resolution of \nterminological, conceptual and measurement issues in the field of inhibitory \nprocesses. Within behavioral inhibition research, confusion exists as to the \ndistinctiveness of impulsivity, self-control, sensation seeking, risk-taking, lack \nof planning, hyperactivity and other usages.  Even within impulsivity, the \nvarious measures bear inconsistent relationships with one another (Hoaken et \nal., 2003). Among studies of cognitive inhibition, some see behavioral \ninhibition as the key developmental competence that allows for the \nemergence of executive control (Barkley, 1997), some see behavioral \ninhibition as a facet of executive function (Pennington & Ozonoff, 1996), some \nsee deficits in behavioral inhibition as the manifestation of failure in cognitive \n 43\nexecutive functions (Hoaken et al., 2003) and others view them as distinctive \nentities (White et al., 1994).   In short, it is unclear whether behavioral \ninhibition is a precursor, manifestation, result or fellow-traveller of cognitive \ninhibition.  It is also frequently unclear whether terms such as impulsivity or \ninhibition are being used to indicate a deficit in specific task performance (a \ncompetence problem) or a characteristic preference (a personality trait) \n(Solanto et al., 2001).  Clarification of the relationship of these various \nconcepts and measures to one another and to aggressive behavior, together \nwith data on sex differences, will be important in firmly establishing the \nmediators of sex differences in aggression. \nTheoretical issues.  \n In recent years, two approaches to sex differences have taken center \nstage and been involved in vigorous debate; social psychological and \nevolutionary approaches (Archer, 1996; Bussey & Bandura, 1999; Eagly, \n1997).  Despite internal diversity and disagreement, social and developmental \ntheorists share the view that sex differences arise from the internalisation of \nsocietal norms or roles about the appropriate behavior of men and women, \nvarying in the extent to which they invoke modelling (Bussey & Bandura, \n1999), gender schematic processing (Martin , Ruble & Szkrybalo, 2002) or \nconformity (Wood & Eagly, 2002) as the mediating process.  According to \nsocial role theory (Eagly, 1987; Eagly & Wood, 1991), sex differences result \nfrom the sexual division of labour, especially into family and occupational \nroles. The tasks assigned to each sex tend to enhance congruent skills and \nbeliefs, and to give rise to gender role expectancies (of women as communal \nand men as agentic) to which people conform or are socialised.  Wood and \n 44\nEagly\u2019s (2002) more recent biosocial theory proposes that men\u2019s greater \ninvolvement in warfare and aggression derives from two anatomical \ndifferences between the sexes: Men\u2019s greater size, speed and upper body \nstrength, and women\u2019s obligatory role in childbearing and nursing infants.  \nTheir causal chain can be broadly summarised thus: Men\u2019s greater body \nstrength makes them better suited for warfare while women\u2019s role in child care \nprevents them from travelling far from home; consequently \u2018warrior values\u2019 are \nincorporated into the male stereotype; males but not females are socialised \ninto and conform to this stereotype resulting in sex difference in aggressive \nbehavior.  The magnitude of sex differences varies with local ecological and \neconomic pressures.  In common with other gender theorists, Wood and \nEagly reject any essential psychological differences between the sexes; \u201cOur \nbiosocial model does not assume that sexual selection pressures that \ncontributed to physical dimorphism between the sexes are major influences \non sex-typed psychological attributes\u201d (Wood and Eagly, 2002, p.702).  \nRather, psychological differences between men and women are acquired \nthrough cultural conformity and socialization.  Not surprisingly, these and \nother gender theorists align themselves against evolutionary perspectives \n(Bussey & Bandura, 1999; Wood & Eagly, 2002).  \nAn evolutionary approach emphasises that, across many species \nincluding our own, asymmetries of parental investment have had a significant \nimpact on those aspects of psychology that have consequences for inclusive \nfitness.  Sex differences are not monolithic (where selection pressures act \nequally on both sexes, no differences are expected) but do appear in those \ndomains associated with sex-specific reproductive success.  Evolutionary \n 45\nanalyses have been offered of sex differences in both aggression and \ninhibition.  Daly and Wilson (1988) argue that males\u2019 higher level of \naggression derives from their greater fitness variance compared to females.  \nUnder effective polygyny (and there is much morphological evidence that this \nwas present during hominid evolution, Daly & Wilson, 1983), men had very \nhigh incentives in terms of reproductive success for establishing intra-sexual \ndominance and, in consequence, securing a large number of mates.  This \nselective advantage meant that more aggressive males out-reproduced their \npeers and the net result is seen in the gene pool today.  Daly and Wilson \n(1994) are agnostic as to the psychological mechanisms underlying this \nadaptation, recognising that the mechanism could involve an increased \nappetite for risk or lower levels of fear or inhibition.  Campbell (1999, 2002) \nsuggested the latter in a complementary view which focuses on female \ndisincentives for aggression.  In this view, women\u2019s desistance from \naggression is not a function of fewer incentives (inherited dominance in \nfemale-bonded primates is associated with greater reproductive success; \nEllis, 1995) but because direct aggression incurs higher potential costs.  \nOffspring\u2019s greater dependence on the mother than the father, women\u2019s \nhigher parental investment in each offspring and the limited number of that a \nwoman can bear in a lifetime relative to a man mean that women\u2019s \nreproductive success depends upon avoiding injury and death to a greater \ndegree than men\u2019s. Because this approach emphasises costs rather than \nrewards, the proposed psychological mechanism is an inhibitory one.  The \navoidance of direct physical risks is mediated by higher levels of fear of bodily \ninjury and is manifested in women\u2019s avoidance of high risk activities generally, \n 46\nincluding direct forms of aggression.  Taylor, Klein, Lewis, Gruenewald, \nGurung and Updegraf (2000) concur that a woman\u2019s mothering role and her \nneed to avoid direct aggression are central to explaining their contemporary \ndesistance from aggression.  They propose that testosterone mediates the \nrelationship between threat and attack and, in consequence, females show \nlower rates of aggression.  Bjorklund and Kipp (1996) argue that inhibitory \nability was more critical to women\u2019s reproductive success than to men\u2019s in \nrelation to mate choice and the need to prioritise the interests of offspring and \nrestrain aggression against them.   \nGender and evolutionary theories lead to divergent predictions with \nregard to the proposal that sex differences in aggression arise from differential \nfear and fear-based inhibition.  Three such predictions are described below.  \nCross-cultural consistency.  Social role theorists propose that \u201cthe \nfemale gender role emphasises avoiding physical harm to oneself\u201d but that \nless traditional forms of this role \u201cinclude an emphasis on assertiveness\u201d \n(Eagly & Steffen, 1986, p.310).  A reasonable prediction would be that fear \nshould be greater among women who accept traditional female gender roles.  \nYet, as noted earlier, correction for gender role adherence and dissimulation \ndoes not eliminate significant sex differences in fear (Arrindell et al., 1993).  \nWhile evolutionary psychology does not discount environmental factors (the \nessence of a successful adaptation is the \u2018goodness-of-fit\u2019 between the gene\u2019s \nproduct and the specific environment), fear is here posited as a sex-linked and \nspecies-typical adaptation.  Hence it is expected that women would show \nhigher fear across a range of cultures, albeit with variation in effect size as a \nresult of facultative adaptation.  Sex differences in fear show \u201cstrong cross-\n 47\nnational consistency\u201d (Gullone, 2000, p.444).  Similar evolutionary predictions \nwould apply to behavioral inhibition, although the prediction of schematic and \nrole theories in this domain is unclear since inhibitory processes are not \nreadily visible and hence not directly available for integration into gender \nschemata or stereotypes.  One cross-national study using ratings and \nobservations of 4 year old children in Britain and Hungary found sex \ndifferences, but not cultural differences, in self control favouring girls (Gervai \net al., 1993).  Further multi-national studies will be critical in examining the \ncultural specificity or universality of sex differences in inhibition.  \nDevelopment.  If sex differences are acquired through a cumulative \nprocess of socialization or enculturation as social theories suggest, then it \nwould seem reasonable to suggest that sex differences should increase with \nage. However this has not been found to be the case (Hyde, 1984) and \ngender theorists now suggest that the age effect may not be linear (Martin, \nRuble & Szkrybalo, 2002).  Either way, the effect size for aggression, d = .53, \ndoes not vary significantly across three age groups investigated (Archer & \nCote, 2004).  Fear has been found to diminish with increasing age in both \nobservational and self rating studies and this is true cross-nationally (Gullone, \n2000), probably reflecting children\u2019s increasing ability to regulate their \nemotions.  However the sex difference is marked in childhood, adolescence \nand adulthood (Brebner, 2003; Gullone, 2000).  A longitudinal study found \nsimilarity in the developmental trajectory of fear and impulsivity in boys and \ngirls (Cote et al., 2002, see also Roberts & DelVecchio, 2000).     \nBecause gender theorists identify stereotypes as the key to sex \ndifferences, it was originally suggested that a child would not be expected to \n 48\nshow sex-typed behavior until such cognitive representations were in place \n(Martin, 1993; Martin & Halverson, 1981).  However sex differences in fear \n(Gartstein & Rothbart, 2003) and aggression are apparent by the age of 2 \n(Archer & Cote, 2004) despite the fact that gender labelling, a necessary \nprerequisite for gender stereotypes, is not firmly achieved until six months \nlater.  Longitudinal studies have generally found weak evidence that gender \nknowledge predates gender-congruent behavior (Aubry, Ruble & Silverman, \n1999; Campbell, Shirley & Candy, 2004; Fagot & Leinbach, 1989;Trautner, \n1992).  Acknowledging this, schema theorists have proposed that the ability to \nperceptually discriminate males and females, which may appear in the first \nyear of life, is sufficient for the initial development of gender schema (Martin, \nRuble & Szkrybalo, 2002; Ruble & Martin, 1998).  Investigation of these \nrudimentary schema will require ingenious research methodology but may \ndemonstrate an earlier understanding of the sex-linkage of fear, inhibition and \naggression.  Nonetheless, such schema would not be expected to guide sex-\ncongruent behavior until the child was able to categorise themselves as male \nor female, an ability that is unlikely to be in place before the age of two years \n(Campbell, Shirley & Caygill, 2002).    \nGender schema theorists also accept that early-appearing sex \ndifferences may be related, inter alia, to \u201cbiological influences\u201d (Martin, Ruble \n& Szkrybalo, 2002 p.918).   Such biological influences may include genetic or \nhormonal factors associated with fear and anxiety which underpin the \nresponsiveness of the child to agents of socialisation and their consequent \nimpulsivity.  Substantial genetic mediation has been found in two different twin \nsamples for the correlation between impulsivity and aggression (Seroczynski, \n 49\nBergman & Coccaro, 1999; Vierikko, Pulkkinen, Kaprio & Rose, 2004).  An \nimportant question for future biological research is the extent to which such a \ncommon genetic predisposition is sex-limited (gene expression depends upon \nhormone levels, such as testosterone) or sex-linked (including non-random X \ninactivation in females, Craig, Harper & Loat, 2004). \nCoherence.  A strong criterion for the identification of an adaptation is \n\u201cspecial design\u201d; the components involved are integrated, efficient, specific \nand coordinated to solve some evolutionary relevant problem.  If the present \nproposal represents an adaptation, we would expect to find the pattern of \nsignificant correlations between fear, behavioral inhibition and aggression.  \nThese correlations should hold equally for both sexes although the values \nassociated with the components would differ with boys in general showing \nhigher aggression and lower fear and inhibition.  According to schematic and \nrole theories, each gender role has a number of associated attributes (e.g. for \nfemales, not exposing oneself to danger and demonstrating concern for \nothers) but the internalisation of one is not contingent on the internalisation of \nothers.  The molecular parts are not functionally integrated at a psychological \nlevel.  It seems reasonable to propose that there is considerable scope for \nindividual differences, in both sexes, in the extent to which they internalise \nand behaviorally conform to each of the various gender-relevant attributes.  If \nthis is the case, the correlations between aggression, fear and inhibition \ndocumented by developmental psychologists require explanation.  \nGender and aggression theorists have much to learn from one another. \nI have suggested that gender theorists could develop a more specific and \nsophisticated account of sex differences by considering recent research in \n 50\naggression, especially the developmental emphasis upon the child\u2019s \nincreasing ability to manage aggressive behavior by emotional and cognitive \nforms of control (Anderson & Bushman, 2002).  Equally, aggression theorists \nhave often failed to appreciate that a theory that does not implicitly predict sex \ndifferences is problematic.  Studies have often used exclusively male samples \nor treated sex as a covariate or side issue---apparently failing to realise that \nthe ability to explain the sex difference in aggression constitutes a sine qua \nnon for any adequate theory.  It is hoped that by explicating a possible model \nof how emotion and inhibition may mediate sex differences in aggression, a \nclearer framework for integrative research uniting both camps may emerge. \n \n \n 51\nReferences \nAckerman, P.L., Beier, M.E. & Boyle, M.O.
