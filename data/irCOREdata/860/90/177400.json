In\nparticular, it is not clear how the surface and the subsurface flow within the permeable bed interact\nand influence each other. In order to clarify this issue we carried out two sets of experiments, one\ninvolving velocity measurements in open channel flows over an impermeable bed composed of a\nsingle layer of spheres, and another one where velocities were measured over and within a\npermeable bed made of five such layers. Comparison of surface flow velocity statistics between the\ntwo sets of experiments confirmed that bed permeability can significantly affect flow resistance. It\nwas also confirmed that even in the hydraulically rough regime, the friction factors for the\npermeable bed increase with increasing Reynolds number. Such an increase in flow resistance\nimplies a different distribution of normal form-induced stress between the permeable and\nimpermeable bed cases. Subsurface flow measurements performed within the permeable bed\nrevealed that there is an intense transport of turbulent kinetic energy \u0001TKE\u0002 occurring from the\nsurface to the subsurface flow. We provide evidence that the transport of TKE toward the lower bed\nlevels is driven mainly by pressure fluctuations, whereas TKE transport due to turbulent velocity\nfluctuations is limited to a thinner layer placed in the upper part of the bed. It was also confirmed\nthat the turbulence imposed by the surface flow gradually dissipates while penetrating within the\nporous medium. Dissipation occurs faster for the small scales than for the large ones, which instead\nare persistent, although weak, even at the lowest bed levels. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Physics.\n\u0003doi:10.1063\/1.3276292\u0004\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn general, the domain of an open channel flow over a\nporous bed can be divided into surface and subsurface flow\nregions, which are located above and within the bed, respec-\ntively \u0001Fig. 1\u0002. The transition layer is defined as that portion\nof the subsurface flow which is influenced by the turbulent\nmotion of the surface flow \u0001Fig. 1\u0002. The hydrodynamic pro-\ncesses that control the interaction between surface and sub-\nsurface flows play an important role in the functioning of\nstream ecosystems and ecologically relevant mass transfer\nprocesses occurring at the sediment water interface of natural\nstreams \u0001i.e., the so called hyporheic exchange processes\u0002.\nFurthermore, the generic problem of flows over permeable\nwalls is relevant for a range of environmental and industrial\napplications such as urban buildings, coastal defense, and\nheat exchangers.\nDespite its importance, the behaviors of turbulent open\nchannel flows over permeable surfaces have not been suffi-\nciently investigated and many issues concerning the interac-\ntion between surface and subsurface flows need to be eluci-\ndated. In particular, it is not clear how the permeability of the\nbed influences the turbulence properties of the surface flow\nand in turn, how the surface flow interacts with the subsur-\nface flow within the transition layer. Sections I A\u2013I C present\na review of the current knowledge on these two topics, high-\nlight the associated shortcomings, and outline the contribu-\ntion from the present paper.\nA. The effects of permeability on the surface flow\nIn many engineering applications, permeability is usu-\nally neglected and turbulent flows over porous beds are con-\nsidered equivalent to standard rough-wall turbulent boundary\nlayers over impermeable beds. However, there is a substan-\ntial difference between flows over impermeable and perme-\nable beds. In the former case, the no-slip condition applies to\nthe solid surface whereas in the latter case, the flow is able to\npenetrate into the bed and to interact with the interstitial\nfluid. Such interaction includes mass, momentum, and en-\nergy exchange between the surface and subsurface flows. A\nfew experimental and numerical studies have provided some\nevidence that permeability can indeed influence the proper-\nties of the surface flow. Zagni and Smith1 conducted experi-\nments with open channel flows over permeable beds com-\nposed of spheres. The size and grading of the bed material\nwere varied extensively in order to investigate the effects of\nvarious beds having different values of permeability on the\nfriction coefficients. The main finding was that even at Rey-\nnolds numbers for which one would expect hydraulically\nrough flow-regime friction factors for permeable beds in-\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Zippe and Graf2\nperformed experiments comparing measurements taken over\npermeable and impermeable beds having the same roughness\ntexture in order to isolate the effects of permeability on the\nsurface flow. The bed material was composed of spheres and\nvelocities were measured by means of a single velocity com-\nponent hot film anemometer. The flows investigated were in\nthe fully rough regime since the size of the roughness ele-\nments was much larger than the viscous length scale. Results\nshowed that the friction factor was higher for the permeable\ncase and it was Reynolds number dependent, hence substan-\ntiating the findings of Zagni and Smith.1 Furthermore Zippe\nand Graf2 observed that the normalized intensity of the\nstreamwise velocity fluctuations for the permeable and im-\npermeable wall collapsed reasonably well.\nRecently, Breugem et al.3 presented Direct Numerical\nSimulations \u0001DNS\u0002 of the volume-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes\nequations for a channel flow bounded by a smooth wall at the\ntop and a permeable wall at the bottom. The volume averag-\ning procedure was applied to a flow region big enough to\nsmooth inhomogeneities at the pore scale but also small\nenough to resolve the flow dynamics of interest at larger\nscales. This approach, besides being computationally less de-\nmanding than a standard DNS proved to be reliable for the\ndescription of flow statistics above and within the permeable\nwall. Breugem et al.3 point out that permeable walls are also\nunavoidably rough. The effect of surface roughness on the\nturbulent flow depends on the roughness Reynolds number\ndefined as Red=du\u0001 \/\u0001, where d is the characteristic diameter\nof the particle composing the bed. The effects of permeabil-\nity on the flow may be quantified by the permeability Rey-\nnolds number defined as ReK=\u0005Ku\u0001 \/\u0001, where K is the wall\npermeability and \u0005K is a length scale of turbulence acting at\nthe pore scale. ReK represents a ratio between effective pore\ndiameter and the viscous length scale \u0001 \/u\u0001. For large values\nof ReK eddies are able to penetrate the permeable wall and\nthe effects of permeability are significant, whereas for ReK\n\u00021 the wall can be considered impermeable. Breugem et al.3\naimed at studying the effects of permeability exclusively;\ntherefore a small particle diameter was imposed in the simu-\nlations in order to have a small Red and high ReK. This\nguaranteed that the effects of permeability were enhanced\nand those of roughness minimized. The analysis of mean\nvelocity profiles showed that the higher the bed permeability,\nthe higher the resistance imposed on the flow. When com-\npared to the smooth wall case, vertical profiles of turbulence\nintensity \u0001i.e., rms of velocity fluctuations\u0002 for the permeable\nwall showed a decrease in the peak of the streamwise veloc-\nity component and an increase in the peak of the spanwise\nand wall-normal components. This effect was explained as a\nconsequence of the absence of longitudinal low- and high-\nspeed streaks destroyed by the turbulent transport across the\npermeable surface.\nThe main outcome from the studies listed above is that\nfriction factors for permeable beds are Reynolds number de-\npendent even in the hydraulically rough regime and, in gen-\neral, are higher than the friction factors related to imperme-\nable beds having identical roughness texture. Zagni and\nSmith1 claimed that the flow mechanism responsible for such\nan increase in friction factors is associated to shear penetra-\ntion within the permeable bed. In other words, they argued\nthat the increase in flow resistance is associated to a more\nefficient energy dissipation caused by the exchange of mo-\nmentum between the surface and subsurface flows, across the\nbed surface. The main shortcoming of the previous experi-\nmental studies is that they are mainly focused on first order\nvelocity statistics and the effects of permeability on other\nrelevant turbulence quantities have been largely neglected.\nB. Turbulence properties of the transition layer\nIn existing literature, there are many experimental and\nnumerical studies of the flow properties of the transition\nlayer in the case of laminar boundary layers.4\u201312 In contrast,\ndue to technical difficulties and heavy computational costs,\nthe number of experiments and numerical simulations explic-\nitly designed for investigating the transition layer between a\nturbulent boundary layer and a porous medium region is\nmuch more limited.13\u201315,3\nRuff and Gelhar13 performed velocity measurements in\npipe flows where the porous medium was composed of foam.\nVelocities were measured by means of hot-wire anemometry.\nResults showed that mean velocities and turbulence intensi-\nties decayed exponentially within the porous medium.\nAnother experimental attempt to gain insight into the\nturbulence characteristics of the subsurface flow was pre-\nsented by Vollmer et al.,15 where pressure fluctuations were\nmeasured at different levels within a gravel bed of an open\nchannel flow, in order to investigate the effects of coherent\nstructures on the exchange of solutes between the surface\nand subsurface flows. The rms of pressure fluctuations were\nfound to decrease exponentially inside the bed where the\nhigh frequency components of the pressure signal vanished\nmore rapidly than low frequency components. It was also\nargued that high frequency pressure fluctuations were caused\nby \u201cbursting\u201d events such as sweeps and ejections, whereas\nlow frequencies were induced by the large scale flow struc-\ntures scaling with the water depth.\nAlthough the main focus of the numerical work by Breu-\ngem et al.3 was investigating the effects of permeability on\nthe surface flow, plenty of results are also presented about\nthe flow within the permeable wall.

In particular,\nexperimental studies on this topic are scarce \u0001only the studies\nfrom Ruff and Gelhar13 and Vollmer et al.15 provided some\ninsight\u0002. More needs to be done to provide data for future\nmodel validations and also to gain more insight into the\ntransport mechanisms responsible for the coupling between\nthe surface and the subsurface flow.\nC. Aims and objectives\nWithin the context of the study of open channel flows\nover permeable beds, the general objectives of the present\npaper are as follows: \u0001i\u0002 investigating the influence of perme-\nability on the turbulence properties of the surface flow, with\nparticular focus on flow resistance, second order velocity sta-\ntistics, and the vertical distribution of shear stress compo-\nnents; \u0001ii\u0002 investigating, with unprecedented experimental\ndetail, the turbulence properties of the subsurface flow within\na packed bed underlying turbulent open channel flows at two\ndifferent Reynolds numbers.\nIn order to fulfill the objectives listed above, we have\ndesigned and carried out two sets of experiments: one set\ninvolved open channel flows over a single layer of spheres,\nwhile for another one the bed was made of five such layers.\nThe one layer bed was considered as rough and imperme-\nable, whereas the five layer bed was considered as rough and\npermeable. The main difference between the two is that the\nlatter allows for the surface flow to interact with a volume of\nfluid below the bed surface, which is much larger than the\ntypical size of the bed roughness. Since the two bed configu-\nrations are characterized by the same roughness texture, the\ncomparison of surface flow velocity statistics between the\ntwo allowed to isolate the effects of permeability.\nThe permeable bed chosen for the experiments is char-\nacterized by a very large value of ReK \u0001Table I\u0002, which ac-\ncording to Breugem et al.,3 classifies the bed as highly per-\nmeable. It is therefore plausible to expect differences in\nsurface flow characteristics between the permeable and im-\npermeable bed cases.\nThe experimental data pertaining to the surface flow ve-\nlocity statistics were computed and interpreted following the\ndouble averaging methodology \u0001DAM\u0002. More details on the\ncharacteristics of such methodology and on its application to\nour set of data are provided later in the text.\nThe packing of the spheres composing the bed was cho-\nsen in order to allow velocity measurements to be performed\nwithin the voids of the permeable bed and therefore to inves-\ntigate the turbulence properties of the subsurface flow. Such\nmeasurements helped identifying the dominant scales of tur-\nbulence characterizing the subsurface flow and to clarify the\ntransport mechanisms which control the exchange of turbu-\nlent kinetic energy \u0001TKE\u0002 between the surface and subsur-\nface flows.\nFollowing the description of the experimental proce-\ndures and methods presented in Sec. II, this paper is orga-\nnized as follows: Sec. III is devoted to the description and\ninterpretation of the results. This section is divided into two\nparts: The first deals with the effects of permeability on the\nsurface flow whereas the second includes the results obtained\nfrom the subsurface flow measurements. Then, in Sec. IV we\npresent a general discussion of the experimental results and\nSec. V summarizes all the main findings of the paper.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE AND PROCEDURES\nAll the experiments were carried out using an 11 m long\ntilting hydraulic flume with a 0.4 m wide rectangular cross\nsection. The bed was covered with 12 mm diameter glass\nballs packed in a cubic pattern and arranged in two bed con-\nfigurations: one characterized by one layer of spheres \u0001con-\nsidered as the impermeable bed\u0002 and another by five layers\n\u0001considered as the permeable bed\u0002. The cubic-packed bed\nextended in both cases for half of the flume length, i.e., for\n5.5 m. All experiments were conducted at uniform fully de-\nveloped turbulent rough flow conditions. The width-to-depth\nratio was kept in all cases higher than 5, for which it is\npossible to assume that the flow was two dimensional, at\nleast in the central part of the flume.16 The experiments were\nconducted with two Reynolds numbers for each bed configu-\nration. Hereafter we refer to these two flow conditions as the\nlow and high Reynolds number \u0001Re\u0002 experiments \u0001Table I\u0002.\nThe permeability of the five layer bed reported in Table I was\ndetermined using a separate rig similar to conventional\n\u201cDarcy apparatus.\u201d Please see Ref. 17 for a detailed descrip-\ntion of the experimental apparatus and the analysis of the\ndata.\nTABLE I.

Surface flow measurements\nFor both bed configurations velocity measurements\nwithin the surface flow were carried out by means of particle\nimage velocimetry \u0001PIV\u0002. PIV is a quantitative flow visual-\nization technique that relies on the illumination of a plane\narea of the flow, which is seeded with small neutrally buoy-\nant particles. In these experiments, hollow glass spheres with\na mean diameter of 15 \u0007m were used as the seeding mate-\nrial. PIV images were obtained from vertical planes of the\nflume by repeatedly illuminating the flow measurement area\nwith a double pulsed Nd-YAG \u0001yttrium aluminum garnet\u0002\nlaser \u0001frequency doubled to produce visible green light\u0002,\nwhich was synchronized with a digital camera \u0003Kodak\n\u0001roper\u0002 megaplus ESI\u0004 that records image pairs with a 1008\n\u00061008 pixels resolution, directly to a high-specification PC\nwith frame-grabbing hardware. VIDPIV analysis software was\nthen used to analyze the images in order to work out the\nvelocity field. The software applies a cross-correlation algo-\nrithm, for each image pair, to regions of the flow called in-\nterrogation areas, where it determines the average particle\ndisplacements in pixel units. Hence, with the knowledge of\nthe time delay between laser pulses and the scale of the digi-\ntal image, the software calculates particle \u0001and flow\u0002 veloci-\nties. Interrogation areas can be overlapped to increase the\nnumber of measurement points and better resolve spatial\ncharacteristics of the flow.\nIn our experiments velocities were measured along the\nbed-parallel and bed-normal directions, which are here de-\nnoted with \u0001u\u0002 and \u0001w\u0002, respectively. The laser light sheet\nwas placed at two streamwise oriented vertical planes \u0001Fig.\n2\u0002: one over the tops of the balls \u0001top section\u0002 and another\nover their connections \u0001valley section\u0002. The spanwise posi-\ntion of the valley and top sections was chosen as close as\npossible to the central cross section of the flume. For each\nmeasurement section, the flow region investigated covered at\nleast one sphere diameter in length. This allowed to have\nenough measurement detail to estimate spatially averaged\nflow statistics.18\nFor each experiment, 2200 images were recorded at a\nsampling frequency of roughly 13 Hz. The random error of a\nPIV measurement was estimated to be \bv=0.0025 m \/s. It\nwas computed as \bv=\bs \/\bt, where \bs corresponds to 1\/10\nof 1 pixel physical dimension, and \bt is the time delay be-\ntween the subsequent images.19 For each experiment the time\ndelay was set as \bt=0.001 s. PIV measurements were vali-\ndated by checking the closure for momentum balance in the\nsurface flow. This was carried out by comparing the shear\nstress obtained from the linear interpolation of spatially av-\neraged Reynolds stress to the level of the bead tops and the\nshear stress estimated from global momentum balance; the\nlatter was calculated in the following two ways:\n\u0004R = \u0005gSR , \u00011\u0002\n\u0004H = \u0005gSH , \u00012\u0002\nwhere \u0005 is the water density, g is the acceleration due to\ngravity, S is the slope of the bed, R is the hydraulic radius,\nand H is the flow depth measured from the bead tops to the\nwater free surface. The representative value of the shear\nstress at the measurement location should lie between the\nestimates provided by Eqs. \u00011\u0002 and \u00012\u0002, respectively.20 Equa-\ntion \u00011\u0002 provides the minimum possible value for the shear\nstress since it is estimated assuming that the flow resistance\nexerted by the sidewalls of the flume is the same as that\nexerted by the bed. Instead Eq. \u00012\u0002 provides the maximum\nvalue since the sidewall effects are neglected. It is encourag-\ning to see that the shear stress estimated from the Reynolds\nstress profiles lies between \u0004R and \u0004H for all the experiments\n\u0001Table I\u0002.\nB.

UVP can measure instantaneous velocities at many lo-\ncations along the measurement axis, permitting calculation\nof both time and space-averaged flow variables. In this ap-\nplication, velocities were measured by means of a 4 MHz\nMet-Flow UVP probe,21 which was inserted in a hole drilled\nin the bed and oriented along the flow, as shown in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002.\nThe probe measures instantaneous velocities at 128 locations\nor bins within a length of about 95 mm. Each measurement\nbin is characterized by a disk shaped sampling volume with\na 0.74 mm thickness and an \u00065 mm diameter. The bin di-\nameter grows with distance from the probe head \u0003Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004\ndue to the divergence of the US beam. Each bin is indepen-\ndent from the other and there is no overlapping among them.\nThe echo signal detected by the probe was monitored\nwith an oscilloscope, which was particularly helpful for rec-\nognizing and then removing obstacles accidentally standing\nalong the measurement axis such as air bubbles or debris\nparticles. In the location of the UVP measurements, glass\nbeads were replaced with a 40 cm strip of plastic beads \u0001Del-\nrin plastic material\u0002 with the same diameter \u000112 mm\u0002 and the\nsame cubic packing. Plastic beads were used because varia-\ntion in their diameters was appreciably lower compared to\nthe glass beads, and this helped avoiding anomalous reflec-\ntions of U.S. from the beads. Furthermore, it is much easier\nto drill holes through plastic than through glass. The holes\nwere used for inserting the UVP probe within the pores of\nthe bed. For the remaining part of the flume, glass beads\nwere preferred because of their much lower cost.\nIn order to improve the quality of the echo signal, seed-\ning was added upstream the test section; instant coffee\nproved to be excellent for this purpose. During the flume\nexperiments the bed-parallel velocity component u was mea-\nsured at several heights of the bed moving the UVP probe at\nfour positions \u0001pores 1\u20134\u0002 whereas bed-normal velocities w\nwere measured placing the probe perpendicularly to the\nflume \u0003Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004. The use of only one UVP probe did not\nallow the simultaneous measurement of both velocity\ncomponents.\nIn a UVP system, the velocity resolution Vmin \u0001i.e., the\nminimum measurable velocity\u0002 can be tuned by setting a\nmaximum measurable velocity Vmax. The lower Vmax the\nsmaller Vmin, i.e., the higher the resolution of velocity\nmeasurements.21 The former was chosen just big enough to\ncover the higher velocity magnitudes in order to have the\nlowest possible Vmin. The Vmin for bed-parallel velocities was\nin the range of 0.8\u20131.1 mm\/s, whereas for the vertical com-\nponent Vmin was 0.7\u20130.9 mm\/s.\nAll the advantages and shortcomings of UVP for mea-\nsuring velocities within packed beds are discussed in depth\nin Ref. 22. Nevertheless, here we list the main results from\nthis previous study: \u0001i\u0002 the UVP probe influences the pore\nflow only in the first 10 mm along the measurements axis;\n\u0001ii\u0002 instantaneous UVP measurements at each location repre-\nsent an average velocity of a fluid parcel contained within\nthe disk shaped sampling volume characterizing each mea-\nsurement point; \u0001iii\u0002 despite the divergence of the US beam,\nflow measurements are reliable and reasonably uniform for at\nleast a length of 90 mm from the probe head.\nIII. RESULTS\nIn the following text, all the results are presented by\nplotting velocity statistics using the roughness tops as the\norigin for the vertical coordinate. The shear velocity used for\nnormalization of velocity statistics is defined as u\u0001=\u0005\u0004RS \/\u0005.\nThe velocity statistics pertaining to the surface flow were\nanalyzed and computed following the DAM. This methodol-\nogy relies on an averaging procedure which follows two\nsteps: \u0001i\u0002 time averaging is applied in order to compute flow\nstatistics for each measurement point contained within the\nflow regions captured by PIV; \u0001ii\u0002 flow statistics resulting\nfrom time averaging are spatially averaged along thin boxes\nparallel to the bed.18 The streamwise extent of such boxes is\none bead diameter and, in the lateral direction, they include\nmeasurement points located in the top and valley section. By\nvirtue of the PIV methodology the thickness of the averaging\nboxes is equal to the height of the interrogation areas. Ide-\nally, at each elevation, the averaging boxes should contain\nenough measurement points to cover all the spatial heteroge-\nneity of the near-bed flow. In our experiments PIV measure-\nments were performed at two lateral sections, where we ex-\npected to capture the largest spatial variations of the flow.\nSpatially averaged statistics computed from more detailed\nFIG. 3.

In order to gain insight\ninto the effects of permeability on the flow structure charac-\nterizing the near-bed flow region, we also present some ve-\nlocity statistics which describe the variability and coherence\nof the time-averaged flow. This includes the \u201cintensity of the\nspatial variability\u201d and covariance of time-averaged veloci-\nties, i.e., \u0005\u0007u\u02dc2\b, \u0005\u0007w\u02dc2\b, and \u0007u\u02dcw\u02dc\b, where the wavy overbar\nidentifies the spatial variations of the time-averaged flow\nwith respect to the double-averaged \u0001DA\u0002 flow \u0001i.e., u\u02dc= u\u00af\n\u2212 \u0007u\u00af\b\u0002. The two quantities \u0005\u0007u\u02dc2\b and \u0005\u0007w\u02dc2\b and the covari-\nance \u0007u\u02dcw\u02dc\b are usually called normal and shear \u201cform-\ninduced\u201d stress, respectively.23,24 The latter represents a fluid\nshear stress term appearing within the DA momentum equa-\ntions. In particular, \u0007u\u02dcw\u02dc\b accounts for the momentum flux\ninduced by the heterogeneity and covariance of the bed-\nparallel and bed-normal time-averaged velocities.25,26 For a\ncomplete review of the DAM methodology and the associ-\nated DA transport equations, see Refs. 27 and 28.\nA. Surface flow: A comparative analysis\nFigure 4 shows DA velocity and spatially averaged Rey-\nnolds stress for the permeable and impermeable bed experi-\nments. Throughout the whole flow depth, DA velocities nor-\nmalized with the shear velocity are lower above the\npermeable bed than those above the impermeable bed. The\nassociated increase in friction factor is 21% in the high Re\nexperiment and 6% in the low Re experiment \u0001Table I\u0002. The\nenhancement of friction factors due to permeability and their\ndependence on the Reynolds number is in line with the find-\nings of Zagni and Smith1 and Zippe and Graf.2\nIn general, the vertical profiles of the spatially averaged\nturbulence intensities \u0001\tu \/u\u0001 ,\tw \/u\u0001\u0002 and shear Reynolds\nstress \u0001\u0007u\u0001w\u0001\b \/u\u0001\n2\u0002 follow curves which agree well with those\ntypical of rough-bed open channel flows. In proximity of the\nbed surface, \tu \/u\u0001 and \tw \/u\u0001 reach the standard maxima of\nroughly 2 and 1, respectively. Further above, \tu \/u\u0001 and\n\tw \/u\u0001 decrease with height following a well known\nexponential-law behavior.29,16 The spatially averaged shear\nReynolds stress linearly increases with decreasing elevation\nuntil it reaches a maximum at z \/d=0.05 and then decreases\ntoward the bed surface. Such a decrease in \u0007u\u0001w\u0001\b \/u\u0001\n2 is due\nto non-negligible form-induced and viscous shear stress,\ncontributing to momentum balance in the near-bed flow re-\ngion \u0001see Fig. 6 below and Ref. 18\u0002. Below the roughness\ncrests, form and viscous drag are also responsible for the\nrapid decrease in the spatially averaged Reynolds stress. Un-\nlike mean velocities, \tu \/u\u0001, \tw \/u\u0001, and \u0007u\u0001w\u0001\b \/u\u0001\n2 show no\nobvious difference between permeable and impermeable bed\nexperiments, except for \tu \/u\u0001, which seem to be slightly\nsmaller for the permeable bed.\nThe normalized TKE production term due to the work of\nthe spatially averaged Reynolds stress against DA mean flow\n\u0001Fig. 5\u0002 is very similar for the permeable and impermeable\nbeds at both Re. This means that the increase in the friction\nfactor for the permeable bed is not a result of enhanced tur-\nbulence production within the surface flow. Therefore, as ar-\ngued by Zagni and Smith1 such additional frictional drag\nmust occur within the bed and probably as a result of en-\nhanced shear penetration.\nFigures 6 and 7 show \u0005\u0007u\u02dc2\b, \u0005\u0007w\u02dc2\b, and \u0007u\u02dcw\u02dc\b normal-\nized with the friction velocity u\u0001 and the local DA velocity\n\u0007u\u00af\b, respectively.

Indeed, \u0005\u0007w\u02dc2\b \/u\u0001 is higher for the impermeable\nbed, at the high Re experiment, but lower at the low Re\nexperiment.

From a\nphysical point of view, this means that the higher the DA\nvelocities, the stronger are the spatial variations of the time-\naveraged flow.\nB. Subsurface flow\nWe now investigate the turbulence properties of the sub-\nsurface flow. The reader should be aware that in this section,\nwe include figures where PIV and UVP data \u0001pertaining to\nthe surface and subsurface flows, respectively\u0002 are shown\ntogether in order to provide a complete picture of the whole\nflow domain, over and below the bed surface. However, the\nvelocity statistics computed from the two sets of data are not\nperfectly comparable since PIV and UVP measure velocities\nwithin significantly different sampling volumes. PIV data are\nused to plot velocity statistics for z \/d\n\u22120.17, whereas UVP\ndata for z \/d\u000b0.

Figure 8 shows time-\naveraged bed-parallel velocities u\u00af measured by the UVP at\nall four levels within the bed. Due to continuity, time-\naveraged velocities increase in the narrower sections of the\npores and decrease in the larger ones. This gives the wavy\nshape profile of u\u00af shown in Fig. 8.\nIn analogy with the surface flow, bed-parallel velocities\nmeasured by UVP, within the subsurface flow, were averaged\nfirst in time and then in space. However, for UVP, the spatial\naveraging window covers a flow region placed between 12\nand 97 mm \u0001seven bead diameters\u0002 from the face of the\nprobe. The first 12 mm of the measurement window were\nneglected because the velocities in this region were influ-\nenced by the probe itself.22 DA velocities are shown together\nin Fig. 9 for all flow conditions.\nIn the upper parts of the bed, where the flow is strongly\naffected by the turbulent stream, DA velocity profiles show a\npeculiar feature: intuitively one would say that mean veloci-\nties within the subsurface flow should decrease uniformly\nwithin the bed due to the weakening of the shearing effect\ninduced by the surface flow. In the experiments presented\nherein, this happens for the flow region 0\u000bz \/d\u000b\u22120.17\nwhere velocities decrease almost linearly with z \u0001measure-\nments of linear velocity profiles within the roughness layer\nof various rough beds are also reported by Nikora et al.30\u0002. In\ncontrast, mean velocities \u0007u\u00af\b below pore 1 \u0001z \/d\u000b\u22121\u0002 start to\nincrease creating an unexpected dip in the velocity profile.\nThe validation of this result as well as a plausible explana-\ntion for this anomalous behavior are discussed in Ref. 25.\nFigure 10 shows turbulence intensities. It is worth noting\nthat due to the technicality of the measurements, the \tw pro-\nfiles contain somewhat inconsistent data. While for PIV data\nit was possible to compute DA of the bed-normal velocity\nstatistics; for the UVP data such spatial averaging could not\nbe applied because velocities were measured only along a\nsingle vertical. The same applies to all the statistics involving\nthe vertical velocity component.\nWithin the bed, turbulence intensity decays following an\nexponential form as observed by Ruff and Ghelar13 and\nBreugem et al.3 The exponential shape is well observable\nonly from the profile of the bed-normal velocity component\nwhich, along the vertical, is resolved by many more points\nthan the bed-parallel component.\nFigure 10 shows that going from pore 4 to 1 \u0001i.e., from\nz \/d=\u22124 to z \/d=\u22121\u0002, turbulence intensities \tu \/u\u0001 increase\nvery slowly. This result may give the wrong perspective of\nthe subsurface flow being characterized by a fairly uniform\nlevel of turbulence. However, such a slow increase can be\njustified by the significant drop of DA velocities observed in\nFig. 9. In fact, turbulence intensities normalized with local\nDA velocities \u0001Fig. 11\u0002 increase at a much higher rate, indi-\ncating that the turbulence activity significantly increases go-\ning from pore 4 to 1.\nFigure 12 shows the third order velocity moments for the\nbed-parallel and bed-normal velocity components, i.e.,\nMuuu= \u0007u\u00013\b \/\tu\n3 and Mwww= \u0007w\u00013\b \/\tw\n3\n, respectively.

Muuu are negative\nthroughout the whole subsurface flow, indicating that large\nvalues of bed-parallel velocity fluctuations occur mainly\nwhen they are negative.\n1. Two-point statistics and spectral analysis\nWe now present two point statistics and spectral analysis\nto investigate the dominant scales of turbulence characteriz-\ning the subsurface flow. The analysis of two point statistics is\nhere focused on the cross-correlation function of the type\nRHuu\u0001r,t\u0002 = u1\u0001\u0001x1,t\u0002u2\u0001\u0001x2,t + \u0004\u0002\/\tu1\tu2, \u00013\u0002\nwhere r= \tx2\u2212x1\t is the streamwise distance between two\npoints taken along the measurement window, \u0004 is the time\nlag, u1\u0001 and u2\u0001 are time fluctuations of the streamwise veloc-\nity component at positions 1 and 2, respectively, and \t1 and\n\t2 represent the standard deviation of the streamwise veloc-\nity component at locations 1 and 2, respectively. Figure 13\nshows cross-correlation functions calculated for spatial lags\nr=24 and 48 mm; x1 was fixed at 24 mm from the head of\nthe probe, in a position where the section of the pore is\nlargest. Since r was chosen as a multiple of the diameter of\nthe spheres, \u0001i.e., d=12 mm\u0002, x2 was also positioned where\nthe pore has its largest section.\nAt pores 2\u20134, the shape of RHuu indicates that the flow is\ncharacterized by eddies having two well distinguished turn-\nover time scales \b\u0004 : \u0001i\u0002 a large one, which imposes non-\nnegligible values of RHuu for turnover time scales roughly\nten times larger than H \/Ub, which is the typical time scale of\nthe largest eddies generated within the surface flow \u0001i.e.,\n\b\u0004\n10H \/Ub\u0002 and \u0001ii\u0002 a small one which instead is respon-\nsible for the appearance of small spikes characterized by\n\b\u0004\u000bH \/Ub. We argue that the large turnover time scales are\ncaused by large scale turbulent motions generated in the sur-\nface flow and then imposed onto the subsurface flow. In-\nstead, the small spikes are associated with pore-scale eddies\nlocally generated within the porous medium in the form of\nwakes forming around the beads. It is not clear why second-\nary peaks do not appear at pore 1. At this location the influ-\nence of the surface flow is strongest and turbulence intensi-\nties are significantly larger than in the lower pores \u0001Figs. 10\nand 11\u0002. It is plausible that the velocity fluctuations associ-\nated to such turbulent flow may be responsible to move wake\neddies in and out of pore 1. This means that such wake\neddies may not be able to travel along pore 1 for distances\nequal to r= \tx2\u2212x1\t and therefore to contribute to RHuu\u0001r , t\u0002.\nCorrelation maxima imposed by the large scale eddies\ndecrease in magnitude from pore 1 to pore 4, indicating that\nthe energy of the large scales of motion imposed by the\nsurface flow progressively weakens when they penetrate\nwithin the bed. Such weakening of large scale eddies is con-\nsistent with the decay of turbulence intensities observed in\n0 0.5 1\n\u22125\n\u22124\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n1\n2\n\u03c3 u\/ <u >\nz\/\nd\nLow Re\nHigh re\nFIG. 11.

At pore 4, RHuu display a weak contribution from\nlarge scale eddies so that pore-scale turbulence become the\nmajor contributors to correlation.\nRHuu maxima for r=24 and 48 mm, being associated to\nlarge or wake-scale eddies, are shifted along the \u0004Ub \/H axis.\nThis is a result of eddy advection. For one spatial lag r, the\nmaxima of RHuu associated to large and wake eddies occur at\ndifferent time lags, which suggest that these two scales of\nturbulence have a different advection velocity Ua. Such ve-\nlocity can be estimated as the ratio between the spatial lag r\nand the time lag at which the maxima in RHuu occur. Advec-\ntion velocities for large and wake-scale eddies were calcu-\nlated for the high Re experiments for which such maxima\nwere most visible. Ua for both eddy scales have been calcu-\nlated for three values of r in order to have a more robust\nstatistics. Figure 14 shows that within the bed, large scale\neddies move much faster than pore-scale eddies. Their ad-\nvection velocity is indeed comparable with the bulk mean\nvelocity Ub of the surface flow. This confirms that such large\nscale eddies must be generated within the surface flow and\nthen imposed within the subsurface flow. Instead, pore-scale\neddies are generated locally because they move at velocities\nwhich are comparable with local\/subsurface mean velocities\n\u0007u\u00af\b\u0001z\u0002.\nPower spectra are usually obtained in the frequency do-\nmain as they are computed from single-point velocity mea-\nsurements. It is possible to go from the frequency to the\nwave number domain by applying the Taylor hypothesis of\nfrozen turbulence and hence have information on the spatial\nstructure of turbulence. This hypothesis relies on the assump-\ntion that turbulent eddies at different length scales are ad-\nvected by a velocity equal to the local mean velocity. In this\nstudy, the horizontal deployment of the UVP probe allowed\nhaving instantaneous measurements of u at 128 points along\nthe x direction so that it was possible to compute spectra\ndirectly in the wave number domain Kx=2\f \/x, where x is\nthe spatial scale of interest. This represents a great advantage\nsince as we have observed from two point correlation func-\ntions, within the bed, eddies of different scales advect with\ndifferent velocities and therefore the Taylor hypothesis is not\napplicable.\nIn order to obtain spectra directly in the wave number\ndomain, one should consider measurements covering a\nlength scale which contains the largest eddies in the flow so\nthat each instantaneous measurement covers most of the tur-\nbulence scales of interest. This condition is best satisfied for\nthe five layer low Re experiment, for which the measurement\nlength covers up to four times the flow depth, which is\nroughly considered as the length of the largest eddies gener-\nated in turbulent open channel flows.31\u201333 We acknowledge\nthat much larger scales have been recently observed in tur-\nbulent boundary layers and pipe flows \u0001up to 20 times the\nboundary layer thickness, see Ref. 34\u0002 but their measurement\nand detection are well beyond the capabilities of our mea-\nsurement system.\nSpectra in the wave number domain were computed as\nfollows: First, instantaneous spectra Su\u0001kx , t\u0002 were calculated\nfor each instantaneous profile of velocity fluctuations u\u0001\u0001x , t\u0002\nusing a fast Fourier transform technique. Instantaneous spec-\ntra were also normalized with the variance of the velocities\nmeasured within each profile. Second, all the spectra ob-\ntained from instantaneous realizations of the flow were aver-\naged at each wave number in order to decrease the confi-\ndence interval pertaining to each spectral estimate.\nSpectra at all elevations are shown in Fig. 15. At pore 1,\nturbulent eddies at low wave numbers \u0001within the range 2\n\rkxH\r10 corresponding to eddies of size between one and\nfour times the flow depth\u0002 are the major contributors to spec-\ntral energy \u0001Fig. 15\u0002.

The damping of spectral energy for such scales is\nconsistent with the decrease in cross-correlation maxima ob-\nserved in Fig. 13. Within the range of 2\rkxH\r10, such\ndamping occurs faster for the higher than for the lower wave\nnumbers. This is consistent with the concept of the porous\nmedium acting as a low pass filter for surface flow turbu-\nlence. Such concept was first introduced in Ref. 15 where\npressure fluctuations were measured within a gravel bed un-\nderneath an open channel flow. The rms of the pressure fluc-\ntuations were observed to quickly decrease within the bed\nand it was found that the bed dissipated high frequency fluc-\ntuations faster than the low frequency components; the signal\nof which was instead persistent even at the lowest bed levels.\nAt pores 2\u20134, power spectra develop a large peak at\nkxH\u000640 which corresponds to an eddy length scale of\n\u00063\u20134 mm \u0003this is particularly visible in Fig. 15\u0001b\u0002 where\nspectra are plotted in premultiplied form\u0004. Such a spectral\npeak mirrors the appearance of the small spikes in the cross-\ncorrelation functions RHuu of Fig. 13 and is associated to a\nwake type of turbulence generated by the flowing of water\naround the beads.\nIt should be noted that in general, in a fully developed\nturbulent flow RHuu computed with r=24 or 48 mm would\nnot be able to capture the contribution of eddies with size of\n3\u20134 mm. This happens because eddies lose their coherency if\nthey travel for distances much larger than their size. How-\never, our experiments \u0001at pores 2\u20134\u0002 were performed at a\nmaximum pore Reynolds number Rep\n250 which, accord-\ning to Ref. 17, supports the occurrence of a transitional\nrather than a fully turbulent flow regime \u0001using the same\nporous bed as in this paper, Horton and Pokrajac17 defined\nthe pore Reynolds number as Rep= \u0007u\u00af\bp \/\u0001, where p\n=5 mm is the pore diameter\u0002. At this regime, wake eddies\nare occasionally shed from the spheres and are free to travel\nalong the pores for fairly long distances without losing their\ncoherency. Indeed, we observed \u0001not shown here\u0002 that at pore\n4 the secondary peak in RHuu is still visible up to lags\nr=72 mm.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nIn the present paper the effects of permeability on the\nsubsurface flow have been isolated by comparing the veloc-\nity statistics of a flow over a single layer of spheres and a\nflow over five layers of spheres. The one layer case is con-\nsidered as an impermeable bed which maintains the same\nsurface roughness as the five layer bed. One may argue that\na layer of half spheres could be a better choice than a layer of\nspheres because it is \u201cmore impermeable\u201d while it still main-\ntains the same surface roughness as the five layer bed. How-\never, the use of spheres instead of half spheres allows evalu-\nating the implications of some of our results for applications\nin river engineering. Indeed, hydraulic engineers usually es-\ntimate parameters related to flow resistance, such as the\nManning coefficient, from the measurement of a characteris-\ntic diameter of the grains composing a river bed surface. By\napplying such a procedure, one would have predicted the\nsame Manning coefficient for both our bed configurations.\nWith our experiments we show that this is not correct be-\ncause the permeable bed has higher friction factors than the\nimpermeable bed composed of identical grains. Therefore\nflow resistance of natural streams with highly permeable\nbeds should be predicted by examining not just the layer of\ngrains composing its surface but also the underlying porous\nstructure. Using half spheres instead of spheres would mask\nthis result because the equivalent diameter of half spheres is\nsmaller than sphere diameter \u0001it is between d and d \/2\u0002 so it\nwould have been perfectly plausible to observe higher fric-\ntion factors for the permeable bed.\nThe experimental data presented in this paper allow\nidentifying the mechanisms of production and transport of\nturbulence in open channel flows over permeable beds: the\nlevel slightly above the roughness tops represents the major\nsource of TKE production \u0001Fig. 5\u0002. Below this level, the\nturbulent transport of TKE diverges, splitting into upward\nand downward contributions \u0001Fig. 12\u0002. The transport of TKE\nby means of turbulent velocity fluctuations vanishes one\nbead diameter below the roughness tops; however more\nTKEs are transported further down within the bed. Indeed\ncross-correlation functions and spectra \u0001Figs. 13 and 15\u0002\nclearly show how large scale eddies generated within the\nsurface flow influence the subsurface flow even at the lowest\nbed levels. Since turbulent transport due to velocity fluctua-\ntions is not responsible for such TKE transfer, this must be\npromoted by pressure fluctuations. This finding is consistent\nwith the results of Breugem et al.:3 in their simulations, the\npressure transport term is the only one \u0001among the other\ntransport terms\u0002 that survives at the deepest positions within\nthe permeable wall.\nThe analysis of our data revealed that in turbulent flows\nover permeable beds, there is a significant exchange of TKE\nbetween the surface and the subsurface flow. Therefore it\nappears surprising, to the authors, why such an interchange\nof energy does not impose any significant difference in the\nturbulence intensity profiles between the permeable and im-\npermeable cases \u0001Fig. 4\u0002. However, we also acknowledge\nthat our results are limited to flows at relatively low Rey-\nnolds numbers. Since we have seen that the effects of per-\nmeability on the surface flow increase with increasing Re, it\nis plausible to expect more influence on the turbulence sta-\ntistics as higher Re are approached.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nVelocity measurements have been carried out in open\nchannel flows over and within a permeable bed composed of\nfive layers of beads. Comparison of flow statistics with an\nimpermeable bed made of just one layer of such beads al-\nlowed investigating the influence of permeability on the sur-\nface flow statistics. Measurements of velocities within the\nfive layer bed allowed investigating the turbulence properties\nof the subsurface flow and its interaction with the surface\nflow above. The analysis of results lead to the following\nmain findings.\n\u0001i\u0002 The permeable bed offers a higher flow resistance\nthan the impermeable bed. Flow resistance increases\nwith increasing Reynolds number. As argued in Ref.\n1, such an increase seems to be caused by enhanced\n125109-11 Turbulence structure of open channel flows Phys.

Since the permeable bed generates\nhigher flow resistance than the impermeable bed, the\nsame quantities, when scaled with u\u0001, become larger\nfor the impermeable bed.\n\u0001iii\u0002 Within the bed, we can recognize two types of turbu-\nlence, one generated at the pore scale and another one,\nmore energetic, remotely generated within the surface\nflow and then imposed onto the flow within the bed.\nThe associated transport of TKE by means of turbu-\nlent velocity fluctuations is limited to the upper part of\nthe bed, whereas the pressure fluctuations allow TKE\nto be transported to much lower bed levels.\n\u0001iv\u0002 Analysis of spectra and two point statistics revealed\nthat the turbulence imposed by the surface flow\ngradually dissipates while penetrating within the po-\nrous medium, which behaves as a low pass filter. In-\ndeed dissipation occurs faster for the small scales of\nturbulence than for the large ones, which instead are\npersistent, although weak, even at the lowest bed\nlevels.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was funded by the United Kingdom Engineer-\ning and Physical Sciences Research Council under Grant No.\nGR\/R51865\/01.
