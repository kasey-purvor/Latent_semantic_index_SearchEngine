The results shows that yolk 27\nsac larvae originating from the HR strain is more sensitive to environmental stressors, in that they 28\nshowed a shorter reaction time to low oxygen levels. Previous studies on adult and juvenile 29\nindividuals from these strains have demonstrated a number of correlated physiological and 30\nbehavioural differences. In yolk sac larvae growth and development depend mainly on internal 31\nfactors, which suggest that at least some aspects of stress coping styles are inherent to the 32\nindividual, before factors such as exposure to social experience or variable access to food resources 33\ncould modify behavioural strategy.34\n35\nKey words: Personality, heritability, plasticity, teleost, fish, development36\n37\nIntroduction38\nDiffering behavioural strategies to cope with situations which challenge the fitness of an individual 39\nhave been suggested to maintain genetic variation in a population (Korte et al., 2005). These 40\nbehavioural strategies correlate with consistent physiological traits, and have been referred to as 41\nstress coping styles (Koolhaas et al., 1999), behavioural syndromes (Sih et al., 1985), temperaments 42\n(Boissy, 1995; Clarke & Boinski, 1995) or animal personality traits (Buss, 1991; Gosling, 2001). 43\nBoth genetic and environmental factors [e.g. social interactions and previous exposure to stress] 44\ncontribute to extensive inter-individual variation in how stressful experience affects behaviour and 45\nphysiology (Carere et al., 2005; Frost et al., 2007; Korzan & Summers, 2007). The tight 46\nrelationship between stress coping style and social stress is demonstrated both by the influence that 47\nprevious social interactions have on physiology and aggressive behaviour (H\u00f6glund, et al., 2001;48\n3\u00d8verli et al. 2004b; Summers et al. 2005), and by how the capacity to react to stressful conditions 49\nwith adaptive neuroendocrine responses predicts social position (Korzan et al., 2006; \u00d8verli et al.,50\n2004a).51\nSince most of the studies of behavioural traits associated with stress coping styles 52\nhave been done on individuals with social experience, studies of socially na\u00efve individuals could 53\nprovide information of the genetic component of an individuals stress coping strategy, verifying the 54\nheritability of these traits. Furthermore, during yolk sac absorption, the growth and developmental 55\nrate of fish are mostly dependent on internal resources (Jobling, 1985).  Effects of social 56\ninteractions and current food supply are thus less important in yolk sac fry than in juvenile and 57\nsexually mature fish, making fish in early developmental stages a promising model for investigating 58\nthe genetic impact on stress coping strategy. However, very little is known about the presence and 59\nexpression of different stress coping styles in these developmental stages in fish.60\nThe present study was designed to investigate effects of parental stress coping style on 61\nbehaviour of rainbow trout at the yolk sac stage (Oncorhyncus mykiss). Early studies indicating the 62\npresence of individual stress coping styles in rainbow trout reported pronounced variation in the 63\nresponse to reduced environmental O2 levels (vanRaaij et al., 1996). Hence, it is of particular 64\ninterest to investigate whether variation in avoidance behaviour in response to low O2 is an acquired 65\nor inherited response.  This question was addressed by exposing larvae, originating from strains that 66\nhave previously been demonstrated to have contrasting  stress coping styles (\u00d8verli et al., 2007;67\n\u00d8verli et al., 2005), to low oxygen levels. The results demonstrate that strain origin affected 68\nbehaviour during exposure to low oxygen levels, indicating that parental stress coping style affect 69\nbehaviour in early developmental stages in fish. 70\n71\n72\n4Material and methods73\nGametes were collected from sexually mature adult fish of the F3 generation from two 74\nrainbow trout strains (HR and LR), selected for divergent stress responsiveness to a standardized 75\nstressor (for details see (\u00d8verli et al., 2007). Fertilization was performed 27 December, 2005, at 76\nSolbergstrand research station. To minimize inbreeding depression, allelic variation in 6 micro-77\nsatellite markers were considered, when the 8 HR and 10 LR F4-families were formed. Stripping 78\nand fertilization was performed with standard methods. Eggs and larvae were incubated at 6,5-7,5 79\noC. Experiments were performed on mixed batches of these families.80\nBehaviour of isolated yolk sac larvae was studied at 550 degree-days after fertilization 81\nin glass boxes (50 mm deep, 10 mm wide and 80 mm high) containing water at 7 oC and either 100, 82\n35 or 10% O2 saturation. The required levels of oxygen saturation were obtained by bubbling N283\nwhile monitoring dissolved O2 concentrations using an O2 electrode (Oximeter 323A, WTW, 84\nWeilheim, Germany).  One individual was placed in each box, whereupon the boxes were sealed 85\nwith a glass lid. During each experiment, the behaviour of two LR and two HR larvae was recorded 86\nsimultaneously on video during exposure to water with the same O2 saturation level, starting 2 87\nminutes after being inserted in glass boxes in random order. Video tapes were analysed for time to 88\nthe initiation of avoidance swimming, defined as the time point at which fry first moved more than 89\nhalf its body length in one continuous movement. Time to the expression of avoidance behaviour 90\nwas set to 450 sec if the fry did not move within 7.5 minutes of the start of the test period. In total, 91\neight larvae from each strain were filmed during exposure to each treatment (10, 35 or 100 % O292\nsaturation). 93\nData are presented as mean +\/- standard error of mean.  Data on time to avoidance94\nwere log-transformed and subjected to a two way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with parental 95\n5stress responsiveness (HR and LR) and oxygen saturation as independent variables, followed by the 96\nTuckey honest significant test (HSD) posthoc test (Statistica 5.1, StatSoft Inc.).97\n98\nResults99\nThe two way ANOVA indicated that lag time to expressing avoidance behaviour was 100\nsignificantly affected by both parental stress coping style (F1,42=4.88, P<0.05), oxygen saturation 101\nlevel, (F2,42=16.8, P<0.001), and an interaction between these two factors (F2,42=3.69, P<0.05). The 102\neffect of reduced O2 levels was strongest in HR larvae, where time to avoidance differed 103\nsignificantly between 10 % and 35 % O2 saturation (P<0.001), as well as between 10% and 100% 104\nO2 saturation (P<0.001; Fig 1). In LR larvae, this relationship between was reflected in a non 105\nsignificant trend for shorter lag time at reduced O2 levels; 10 % compared to 100 % O2 saturation106\n(P>0.05) and 35% compared to 10 % O2 saturation (P>0.05; Fig 1). Latency to express avoidance 107\nbehaviour differed significantly between HR and LR larvae exposed to 10 % oxygen levels108\n(P<0.05), with HR larvae showing the shortest response times (Fig 1). There were no significant 109\ndifferences in lag time to express avoidance behaviour between the HR and LR line at 35% 110\n(P>0.05) or 100 % (P>0.05) O2 saturation, or between 35 % and 100% O2 saturation within the HR 111\n(P>0.05) or the LR (P>0.05) larvae.112\n113\nDiscussion114\nIn the present study, decreased oxygen levels resulted in a shorter lag time for the 115\ninitiation of avoidance behaviour in both the HR and LR strains. Furthermore, in the lowest oxygen 116\nsaturation (10 %) the HR larvae initiated this behaviour earlier than the LR larvae. 117\nPrevious studies of adults and juveniles originating from the strains selected for high 118\n(HR) or low (LR) plasma cortisol response to confinement stress, demonstrate a number 119\nphysiological and behavioural differences between the lines when challenged by a stressor 120\n6(reviewed by; (\u00d8verli et al., 2005). Behavioural studies suggest that increased locomotor activity is 121\na general characteristic of the stress response in the HR strain (\u00d8verli et al., 2005; Schjolden et al.,122\n2005). Different behavioural responses to hypoxic conditions have been shown to correlate with 123\nother physiological and behavioural traits, describing an individuals\u2019 stress coping style in juvenile 124\nand adult salmonid fish (Brelin, et al., 2005; vanRaaij et al., 1996). Hence, it seems likely that the 125\ndifferent responses to hypoxic conditions exhibited by HR and LR larvae in the present study, 126\nreflects parental stress coping style.127\nThe heritability of different stress coping styles has been suggested to maintain 128\ngenetic variation in a population (Korte et al., 2005). However, theoreticians suggest that the 129\nbehavioural output during a challenge should be plastic in order to adopt a behaviour which is 130\nbeneficial for an individual in an actual situation (Dall et al., 2004). In addition to genetic factors  131\n(Koolhaas et al., 1999; Koolhaas et al., 2007; \u00d8verli et al., 2007), environmental factors and 132\nexperience, such as social stress, modulate individual stress coping style (Carere et al., 2005; Frost, 133\net al., 2007; Korzan and Summers, 2007). The present study demonstrates the presence of divergent 134\nstress coping styles during the yolk sac stage in rainbow trout. These differences reflect the 135\nrespective parental stress coping style, and are present before exposure to social stress or other 136\nenvironmental inputs, such as variable or insufficient food supply. This suggests a rather strong 137\nheritability in this species.  The mechanisms for this inheritance have to be further investigated. In 138\nthe present study maternal effects, such as egg size or yolk composition was not investigated. 139\nHowever, earlier studies of these strains do not indicate any difference in egg size (Pottinger and 140\nCarrick, 2000). If other maternal effects, such as hormone deposition in eggs and\/or yolk 141\ncomposition, affect individual stress coping style needs further studies.  142\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrates that decreased oxygen levels induces a 143\nshorter lag time for expressing avoidance behaviour in rainbow trout  yolk sack larvae. 144\n7Furthermore, the observation that yolk sack larvae originating from the HR strain showed stronger 145\navoidance to hypoxic conditions than the LR strain, suggest that strain differences in behaviour are 146\nexpressed before social experience or other environmental factors could modify an individual\u2019s 147\nstress coping style.148\n149\nAcknowledgements150\nThis study was supported by the Norwegian Research Council.151\n152\n8References153\n154\nBoissy, A.
