It aims to provide one point of entry to MacIntyre\u2019s work \nfor readers who have not been introduced to it and makes some novel suggestions \nabout its development for those who have.  Following some initial comments on \nMacIntyre\u2019s approach to social science it traces the development of his ideas on \norganisation from 1953 to 1980 before outlining the general theory of virtues, goods, \npractices and institutions which emerged in the publication of his seminal After Virtue \nin 1981.  Finally the paper outlines some of the uses to which these ideas have been \nput in the organisational literature.  \n \nIntroduction \n \nAlasdair MacIntyre is known as a moral philosopher rather than as an organisation \ntheorist and he has indeed been self-critical in respect of his lack of attention to, what \nhe has termed, the \u201cproductive crafts\u201d (MacIntyre 1994a: 284).  However the growth \nof his influence across social science since the publication of his seminal After Virtue \nin 1981 (Soloman 2003: 142) has extended to work within organisation science \nthough much of this work continues to be contested. \n \nIt is in this context that we have written this paper. Its purposes are threefold.  First to \nintroduce MacIntyre\u2019s ideas on virtue in the context of organisation, second to trace \nthe development of these ideas and finally to sketch some of the uses to which they \nhave been put in the organisational literature. If successful, it will provide one point of \nentry to MacIntyre\u2019s work for readers who have not been introduced to it and make \nsome novel suggestions about its development for those who have. \n \nMacIntyre\u2019s critique of contemporary organisations has formed a remarkably \nconsistent feature of work that has in wider respects been noted for the changes \nevident in its ideological commitments (Horton and Mendus 1994: 1; Borradori 1994; \nMacIntyre 1994b). In attempting to present elements of his work to make this case, \nour selections reflect authorial intent more than the structure of his original \narguments. We hope that we have done no violence to the original but are aware that \nthis paper is no substitute for it.  \n \nThe paper begins with some preliminary commentary on epistemology, without which \nour notion of his \u2018general theory\u2019 might too easily be seen as a set of abstractions. It \ntraces MacIntyre\u2019s occasional work on contemporary organisations between 1953 and \n1980 and suggests that his empirical research with practicing managers in the power \nindustry alerted MacIntyre to the parallels between the compartmentalisation of moral \npositions within individuals\u2019 roles as managers, citizens and family member and the \nvictory of emotivism over other moral philosophies in the modern age.  The paper \nthen provides an account of what we claim to be his \u2018general theory\u2019 of virtues, \ngoods, practices and institutions which appeared with After Virtue.  It concludes with \nan account of the use of MacIntyre\u2019s ideas in the organisational sciences literatures.  \n \nMacIntyre as critical realist \n \nAmong the relatively fixed points of MacIntyre\u2019s moving ideological commitments is \nhis critical realist approach to method in social science (see Turner 2003). MacIntyre \nsees relations between social structures, social roles (and characters) and the \nframework of ideas in which agency comes to be understood as intimate. The factors \nthat agents take to be motives for and justifications of action are historically rooted in \nthe type of social roles and ideologies which frame the relations between motives and \naction.   \n \nFor example, the modern noumenal self needs little justification for action other than \nit be freely chosen, whereas the ancient self of Greek civilisation could not have so \njustified her action because she had not acquired a notion of free choice. For her, \nfreedom to choose extended only to alternative means of fulfilling a social role in a \nset of circumstances whose understanding included that of the range of actions \nrequired by those who inhabit her social role (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 58-59).   \n \nIt follows that MacIntyre has consistently rejected understandings of social science as \nscience (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 88-108), in which human behaviour can be \nexplained, predicted and at least in part controlled through the identification of \nrelationships between variables, precisely because the understanding of those \nvariables is peculiar to social structures in which concepts express relationships \ncharacteristic of those structures (MacIntyre 1978 [1971]: 83-84). \n \nMacIntyre presents an extended argument in Chapters 6 to 8 of After Virtue in which \nthese notions are applied to the claim to expertise relied on by managers for their \nauthority (pace Weber).  This is the claim \u201cto possess systematic effectiveness in \ncontrolling certain aspects of social reality\u201d (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 74).   MacIntyre \nargues that such expertise (and the education that promises its transference) requires \nthe demonstration of law-like generalizations, hypotheses of causation which predict \nand explain in the same way as those in natural science (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 88-\n105).  However, sources of unpredictability in human action (including the notions \nthrough which behaviour is understood) are such to render knowledge of this kind \nimpossible. \n \nMacIntyre concludes that the idea of management\u2019s expertise in controlling social \noutcomes is a myth whose purpose is the maintenance of an ideology in which the \ndistinction between manipulative and non-manipulative action is obscured in the \nname of effectiveness (see also Brehony 2002).  The limits MacIntyre places around \nthe claims of social science are no proxy, however, for a commitment to social \nconstructivism (and its post-modern allies) in its denial of the possibility of truth (see \nfor example, Borradori 1994: 265).   \n 2\n \nMacIntyre\u2019s position is liable to cause readers some confusion and one commentator \nhas observed that \u201cit may be MacIntyre\u2019s special distinction to strike half of his \nreaders as an old-fashioned universalizing metaphysician (since he defends a version \nof tradition and teleology) while striking the other half as a dangerous relativist\u201d \n(Higgins 2004: 35).   \n \nAchtemeier (1994) offers a solution to this problem in arguing that MacIntyre\u2019s \napproach to social science may be labelled \u2018critical realist\u2019 (Bhaskar 1975; Hartwig \n2005).  At the risk of over-simplification critical realism can be characterised as an \napproach which maintains the existence of an objective reality (hence exhibits a \nrealist ontology) while being sceptical toward our ability to understand it (hence a \ncritical epistemology).  MacIntyre\u2019s scepticism carries a unique historical flavour but \nthere is enough here that echoes critical realism for MacIntyre\u2019s work to suffer from \nthe same misunderstandings that have beset critical realist work.  Part of this problem \nis that readers schooled in modern treatments of research methods have learned \nneither to distinguish between ontology and epistemology nor to recognise that \nabjuring this distinction is itself characteristic of a distinctive position.  \n \nNowhere is this more evident than in Burrell and Morgan\u2019s (1979) collapsing of \nontology and epistemology into a single subjective-objective axis which along with \nthe axis of stability and change serves to locate alternative research paradigms.  For \nMacIntyre such approaches fail in their definition of axes and consequently in their \nattempt to fix boundaries around ideological commitment. What is missing from such \naccounts includes any notion of time.  For MacIntyre intelligibility requires narrative \nand narrative requires historical awareness (1990, 1985 [1981]: 206, 210).   \nSummarising MacIntyre\u2019s entire project Murphy writes: \n \n\u201cThe path out of the moral wilderness is the formulation of an ethics of human \nnature where human nature is not merely a biological nature but also an \nhistorical and social nature \u2013 and the formulation of an historical, but not \nrelativistic, account of rationality in inquiry.\u201d (2003: 7) \n \nMacIntyre\u2019s commitment to historical understanding of the development of ideas is \nbound up with his critical realism \u2013 such is the intimacy of the relations between ideas \nand social structures that changes to both over time render redundant any attempt at a \nonce-and-for-all determination of paradigms. Accustomed as we are to thinking about \nobjectivist and subjectivist assumptions as either opposites or polarities along a \ndimension, an understanding of MacIntyre\u2019s position requires us to recognise that this \nway of thinking about ideas within social science is itself historically specific \n(Tsoukas and Cummings 1997). Indeed in Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry \n(1990) MacIntyre traces and dissects the histories of both objectivist and subjectivist \napproaches to moral enquiry (labelled as Encyclopaedia and Genealogy respectively). \n \nIn writing such an account historically and not analytically he was committed to, \nargued for and exemplified a different approach to doing social studies \u2013 one he labels \nnot as \u2018critical realist\u2019 but as \u2018tradition\u2019. In this approach enquiry is undertaken \nthrough using the best methods we have discovered up to now to determine the most \naccurate rendering of the truth that can be given up to now. And part of doing \n 3\nintellectual work this way is the acknowledgment of the historical rootedness of our \nideas, methods and results. \n \nIt turns out that we can only understand this if we have available to us a notion of \ntradition in which today\u2019s \u2018best so far\u2019 is only \u2018best so far\u2019 because it gives a better \n(according to the \u2018best so far\u2019 criteria we have of establishing merit) account of \nwhatever it is we are considering than have previous accounts (see Borradori 1994: \n262 for a brief version of this argument and MacIntyre 1988 for an extended version).  \nThe traditional approach to enquiry holds to a notion of truth which seeks neither the \ntimelessness of law-like generalisations nor the dissolution of categories through \nwhich enquiry is undertaken (the end point of genealogy). Skinner and Foucault are \nlikewise rejected. \n \nIf social theory involves neither testing hypotheses to adduce relations between \nvariables in the cause of developing law-like generalisation allowing for control of \nsocial phenomena, nor deconstructing postulates in the cause of unmasking power \nrelations, then what does it involve?  For MacIntyre, social theory is active self-\nreflection in the context of practice; the notion of disengaged theorising is illusory. As \nearly as 1953 he wrote that, \u201cHegel forgot what Kierkegaard remembered when \nKierkegaard said that the tragedy of the speculative philosopher is that he must turn \naside from his place as a spectator of time and eternity in order to sneeze\u201d (MacIntyre \n1995 [1953]: 16-17), and this opposition to speculative theory remains his position in \nhis mature work (MacIntyre 1994a: 289).   \n \nHis commitment to an engaged philosophy marks an aspect of MacIntyre\u2019s rejection \nof utilitarian and other supposedly \u2018rational\u2019 systems constructed in the \nEnlightenment. An early MacIntyre text (1964) captures this. Here he uses Dickens\u2019 \ncontrast of Gradgrind\u2019s functional definition of a horse in Hard Times with the \u201cliving \nskill\u201d of horse-riding (MacIntyre 1964: 5-6) to illustrate the point that abstract \nknowledge has \u201cnothing to do with an ability to handle horses\u201d (MacIntyre 1964: 6). \nOver thirty years later, his commentary on Marxism\u2019s detachment from practice \nechoes the same point (MacIntyre 1995 [1953]: xxviii-xxx).      \n \nFrom his earliest writings onwards, before his concept of a \u2018practice\u2019 became central \nto his mature project (for example MacIntyre 1995 [1953]: 60), through his \ncommitments to and rejections of large portions of Marxism (Borradori 1994: 258-\n259), he has maintained that social theory should embody features of practical social \nlife and that the proper purpose of theory is to enable practitioners to develop better \nunderstandings of that life.  Further, the ability to resolve the disputes between or \ninconsistencies within previous theories rather than the ability to explain, predict and \ncontrol behaviours is the hallmark of successful theorising (MacIntyre 1977a: 460).   \n \nHaving set out the broad direction of MacIntyre\u2019s understanding of theorising and \ndistinguishing it from what usually is required for systematic thinking to be labelled \n\u2018theory\u2019 we now turn to a representation of MacIntyre\u2019s theorising about \norganisations.  Although subsequent reflections demonstrate MacIntyre\u2019s rejection of \nsome key theses in his first significant publication in this area (particularly his preface \nto its most recent reissue (1995 [1953]: v-xxxi) Marxism and Christianity contains the \ncondemnation of the capitalist mode of organisation that has persisted in his work \n(Murphy 2003: 3). In the section that follows we focus on two main features of this \n 4\ncriticism of contemporary organisations \u2013 the centrality of utilitarianism to corporate \ndecision-making and the effects of work under capitalism. We then turn to After \nVirtue in 1981, as it is only from this point that a positive account of work in \nconditions of human flourishing can be found and the centrality of a conception of the \nvirtues emerges.   \n \n \n \nMacIntyre on contemporary organisations, 1953 - 1980 \n \nDecision-making in the capitalist mode \n \nThe focus of MacIntyre\u2019s comments on contemporary organisations prior to After \nVirtue is overwhelmingly critical. MacIntyre does not detain readers long with \ndistinctions between types of organisation within capitalism but consistently identifies \ncapitalism both with modernity and bureaucracy as a mode of production. The \ndistinction between public and private organisations is also subsumed in his work \n(MacIntyre 1964: 11; 1985 [1981]: 25) and there is no evidence to suggest, in so far \nas they take on bureaucratic form, that voluntary organisations are in any way exempt.  \nHis position explicitly follows Weber: \n \n \u201cOnce the executive is at work the aims of the public or private corporation \nmust be taken as given \u2026 The business executive does not differ in this view \nof his task from other bureaucrats.  Bureaucracies have been conceived, since \nWeber, as impersonal instruments for the realization of ends which \ncharacteristically they themselves do not determine.\u201d (MacIntyre 1977b: 218) \n \nBureaucratic organisations resolve allocation questions through a utilitarian mode of \ndecision-making that suffers all the incoherencies of both act and rule utilitarianism \nmore widely. These are outlined in MacIntyre\u2019s paper Against Utilitarianism in 1964 \nand extended to include a wider range of arguments in the chapter cited above on \nUtilitarianism and Cost Benefit Analysis (1977), a precursor to work contained in \nCorporate Modernity and Moral Judgment: are they Mutually Exclusive? (1979).    \n \nUtilitarianism dominates organisational decision-making because \u201cit provides us with \nour only public criterion for securing agreement on moral and political questions\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1964: 2) but fails in its inability to discover ends or purposes. The \nmanager learns to operate without noticing this failure because the boundaries that \ndefine corporate responsibility ostensibly leave issues of public good to government \nand the goodness of the product to the consumer (MacIntyre 1977b: 219). With such \nconsiderations apparently externalised the manager generates options for action, gives \nscales to incommensurable alternatives, establishes the weighting of options and \ndetermines both range and time-scale of affects to be accounted for, using a series of \nnon-utilitarian normative and evaluative commitments (MacIntyre 1977b: 220-224).  \nIt is only once these decisions have been taken that the formal processes of cost-\nbenefit analysis, job evaluation and so on provide the veneer of objectivity and allow \nthe manager to \u2018crunch the numbers\u2019. \n \nIn an interesting echo of Milton Friedman (1970) MacIntyre asserts that one of the \nfunctions of this is to avoid the unmanageable conflict that would ensue from any \n 5\nserious engagement with the claims that would follow should boundaries around the \nresponsibilities of the role be removed (MacIntyre 1977b: 236-237).  The difference is \nthat for Friedman, unlike MacIntyre, ensuring that such questions do not arise is a \ngood thing. \n \nThe effects of work \n \nIn 1953 MacIntyre wrote approvingly of Marx\u2019s notion of alienation as a description \nof the condition of the worker under capitalism: \n \n\u201cHence it is the worker\u2019s personality, his chance of a properly human life that \nis destroyed by his loss. In this the economic system is not interested. The \nworker owning only his own labor is, in the present system, nothing else but \nhis labor, a mere commodity, no longer a person, but a thing.\u201d (MacIntyre \n1995 [1953]: 51, emphasis added) \n \nPutting aside the question of whether this is an accurate portrayal of this or that or \nindeed of every worker\u2019s predicament under capitalism or indeed within any \nbureaucratic organisation, it is the notion of a \u201cproperly human life\u201d and later an \n\u201cessentially human life\u201d (MacIntyre 1995 [1953]: 52) against which to contrast the \nassessment that is of particular interest. At this stage all MacIntyre offers by way of a \npositive notion of human life is repetition of Marx\u2019s nostrum of the \u201crealized \nnaturalism of men\u201d (MacIntyre 1995 [1953]: 55). MacIntyre later argued that this \nnotion found its origin in the German Romantic ideal (MacIntyre 1965 reprinted in \n1978 [1971]: 66).  \n \nBy this time he had already noted the limits industrialisation puts in the way of any \nsuch realisation, for it entails that, \u201call specifiable tasks for human beings can be \nreduced to routine movements which a machine can perform\u201d (MacIntyre 1962: 67), \nthereby reducing any sense of \u201crealized naturalism\u201d or a \u201cproperly human life\u201d to a \ngrimly ironic and peculiarly undefined joke. It also engenders the distinction between \nthose who manipulate and those who are manipulated that plays a central role in After \nVirtue some 16 years later, and which forms a core part of his contention that \nmodernity is characterised by emotivism (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 11-12).   \n \nThe manipulators were themselves no nearer realising an \u201cessential humanity\u201d. By the \nmid-1960\u2019s MacIntyre had taken Weber\u2019s description of the bureaucratic manager as \nread and accepted the transformation from individualist to what may be labelled \nmanagerial capitalism (Nielsen 2002) in a way that was not evident a decade earlier \nin Marxism and Christianity: \n \n\u201cThe earliest critics of capitalism saw social power as in the hands of \u2018Them\u2019, \nwhen it ought to serve \u2018Us\u2019. But power is now, although it is no nearer \u2018We\u2019, \nnot so much a matter of \u2018They\u2019 as \u2018It\u2019.\u201d (MacIntyre 1964: 13)    \n \nAnd from this point forward the \u2018It\u2019 increasingly attracts MacIntyre\u2019s attention in the \ncharacter of the bureaucratic manager. His descriptions in the 1964 paper prefigure \nmuch of what was to follow. Using Hegel\u2019s concept of \u2018the spiritual Zoo\u2019 he identifies \nmanagers as sharing the morality of those \u201cwho live in separate cages and choose not \n 6\nto ask why there are bars or what lies outside them\u201d (MacIntyre 1964: 14) but instead \noccupy themselves fully with the issues that lie to hand.  \n \nIn similar vein A Short History of Ethics in 1967 sees the managers of the holocaust \nas epitomizing a utilitarian orientation in which \u201cspecialists such as Eichmann \u2026 \nboasted that they merely discharged their function in arranging for so much transport \nto be provided between point X and point Y. Whether the cargo was sheep or Jews, \nwhether points X and Y were farm and butcher\u2019s slaughterhouse or ghetto and gas \nchamber, was no concern of theirs\u201d (MacIntyre 1967: 207-208).   \n \nMacIntyre next addresses workplace issues in something other than passing \ncommentary some twelve years later through his involvement with a University of \nNotre Dame Project involving executives in the electrical power industry. This \nresulted in his most detailed work on organisations to date. His role in this project, \ncoming at a time of \u201csometimes painful self-critical reflection\u201d (Reddiford and Watts \nMiller 1991; Miller 1994: 268) appears significant to his wider corpus as the papers \nthat resulted presage a number of the arguments subsequently found in After Virtue. \n \nThe role of the bureaucratic manager was still geared to the performance of utilitarian \ncalculations designed to enhance organisational effectiveness but a more dramatic \nimplication had become evident. For while the manager (in any bureaucratic \norganisation) remained in the spiritual zoo, systematically excluding from his purview \nconsiderations \u201cwhich he might feel obliged to recognise were he acting as parent, as \nconsumer, or as citizen\u201d (MacIntyre 1979: 126), he also carried roles as parent, \nconsumer and citizen. Those who fulfilled these roles were now seen as \ncompartmentalised selves for whom adaptability in changing their ostensive character \nwas an essential quality: \u201cin the modern corporate organization character has become \nmore like a mask or a suit of clothing; an agent may have to possess more than one\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1979: 125).  In private correspondence MacIntyre has confirmed to us that \nhis thinking was in part developed through empirical work in which hypothetical \nscenarios were put to the power company executives (6 October 2005).  \n \nIn a world \u201cdominated by corporations\u201d (MacIntyre 1979: 128) their presentation as \nmoral beings \u201csplinters morality into disassociated parts\u201d (MacIntyre 1979: 124), a \npartitioning unique to corporate modernity. The importance of MacIntyre\u2019s work with \npracticing managers is that the publication which followed introduces for the first \ntime in his writing the contrast between the partitioned morality of corporate \nmodernity and the integrated morality of practice-based communities in \u201ca total order \nwhich both integrates diverse roles and subordinate orders\u201d (MacIntyre 1979: 132).  \nThe observed weaknesses of managers\u2019 utilitarian thinking and the fragmented \nexistence of managers under corporate capitalism both illustrates the intimacy \nbetween social structures and social ideology and justifies the project of creating an \nalternative, a project he was to begin with After Virtue: \n \n\u201cWhat positively would have to be the case to provide the conditions for a \nsociety in which man as such and of rational criteria could have a place?  To \nanswer this question would require more than a single paper.\u201d (MacIntyre \n1979: 132) \n \n 7\nMacIntyre on contemporary organisations, 1981 - 1999: a \u2018general theory\u2019 of \nvirtues, goods, practices and institutions \n \nAfter Virtue combines an account of the failure of the Enlightenment project of \ndeveloping a universal rational morality with a case for recovering the virtue-based \naccount of morality that it wrongly attempted to supersede. Reflecting MacIntyre\u2019s \ncontinuing view of the intimacy of theoretical and practical social developments is an \naccount of social development and particularly that of the fragmented morality of the \ncorporate organisation that both reflects and fosters the state of moral theory. Part of \nwhat the Enlightenment forgot and bureaucracies private or public have never fully \naccounted for is a distinction between the two categories of good whose creation \nresults from socially co-operative practices. As early as 1964 MacIntyre hinted at this \nissue: \n \n\u201cThe production of consumption is as much a mark of our society as the \nconsumption of what is produced. Hence each becomes a means to the other \nand we find once more a chain of activity in which everything is done for the \nsake of something else and nothing is done for its own sake.\u201d (MacIntyre \n1964: 8-9, emphasis added) \n \nThe obliteration of ends, as we have seen, is a central weakness of the utilitarian mode \nof decision-making, the corporate form that masks it and the men and women whose \nlives it characterises. \n \nIn After Virtue MacIntyre introduced a new language to describe both the distinction \nbetween goods that are proper ends \u2013 internal goods, and those \u201cdone for the sake of \nsomething else\u201d \u2013 external goods, and the relationship of these to virtues, practices \nand institutions. Parts of this \u2018general theory\u2019 have been used by various \ncommentators, with the emphasis usually on the notions of virtues and practices. But \nit is clear that MacIntyre intended his contribution to be an integrated schema (one \nexception to this partial usage is that by Moore 2002, 2005a, 2005b.). \n \nThere is then a tension between these two different types of goods (MacIntyre 1985 \n[1981]: 188-189). Internal goods, such as those obtainable from loving relationships, \nplaying or listening to a piece of music, or from various kinds of intellectual \nstimulation are generally derivable from the exercise of the virtues in a search for \nexcellence within the context of a particular practice. By contrast external goods such \nas prestige, status or money can be achieved in a variety of alternative ways not linked \nto any particular practice. These are referred to as \u201cgoods of effectiveness\u201d, as \nopposed to internal goods which are \u201cgoods of excellence\u201d. That these different types \nof goods (they are both genuinely \u201cgoods\u201d) are mutually reinforcing should be \nevident. As MacIntyre puts it: \n \n\u201cIt would be a large misconception to suppose that allegiance to goods of the \none kind necessarily excluded allegiance to goods of the other \u2026 Thus the \ngoods of excellence cannot be systematically cultivated unless at least some of \nthe goods of effectiveness are also pursued. On the other hand it is difficult in \nmost social contexts to pursue the goods of effectiveness without cultivating at \nleast to some degree the goods of excellence \u2026\u201d (MacIntyre 1988: 35) \n \n 8\nHowever, while in the ideal situation these different kinds of goods are mutually \nreinforcing, it is clear from MacIntyre\u2019s work that internal goods should be privileged \nover external goods if the good life is to be achieved. The danger is that the opposite \noccurs. MacIntyre warns: \u201c[w]e should therefore expect that, if in a particular society \nthe pursuit of external goods were to become dominant, the concept of the virtues \n[necessary for the achievement of internal goods] might suffer first attrition and then \nperhaps something near total effacement, although simulacra might abound\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 196). \n \nThere is the beginning here of the link between virtues and goods, but in order to \nunderstand this more fully we require MacIntyre\u2019s concept of a practice. His oft-\nquoted definition is as follows: \n \n\u201cAny coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human \nactivity through which goods internal to that form of activity are realized in \nthe course of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which are \nappropriate to, and partially definitive of, that form of activity, with the result \nthat human powers to achieve excellence, and human conceptions of the ends \nand goods involved, are systematically extended.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: \n187) \n \nThe concept of a practice allows MacIntyre to move from an initial definition of \nvirtues (\u201cdispositions not only to act in particular ways but also to feel in particular \nways. To act virtuously \u2026 is to act from inclination formed by the cultivation of the \nvirtues\u201d (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 149)), to link virtues with internal goods and \npractices more specifically: \n \n\u201cA virtue is an acquired human quality the possession and exercise of which \ntends to enable us to achieve those goods which are internal to practices and \nthe lack of which effectively prevents us from achieving any such goods.\u201d \n(MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 191) \n \nMacIntyre illustrates this relationship between virtues and practices by reference to \nexamples including football, chess, architecture, seascape painting and cricket \n(MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 187, 191) and argues that, \u201cit is not difficult to show for a \nwhole range of key virtues that without them the goods internal to practices are barred \nto us \u2026\u201d (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]:: 191). It is also clear that there is considerable \nbreadth in his concept of a practice (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 188), and this can be \nregarded both as a strength and, as we shall discuss below, a weakness of his \u2018general \ntheory\u2019. \n \nVirtues, however, are not simply practice-specific, but span and are applicable to all \npractices and situations in which an individual is involved. Not only this, but the \nvirtues are also set within the context of the notion of telos \u2013 the good for man (sic): \n\u201c[t]he virtues are precisely those qualities the possession of which will enable an \nindividual to achieve eudaimonia [generally defined as well-being] and the lack of \nwhich will frustrate his movement toward that telos\u201d (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 148). \nThus we have a situation in which the virtues enable the individual to achieve the \ngoods internal to practices, and the achievement of those goods across a variety of \n 9\npractices and over time is instrumental in the individual\u2019s search for and movement \ntowards their own telos. \n \nWe thus arrive at a point in MacIntyre\u2019s \u2018general theory\u2019 at which the concept of a \nquest becomes important. For the virtues are clearly not ends in themselves but means \nto the end of achieving the individual\u2019s telos. MacIntyre makes the point that without \nsome partly determinate conception of the final telos there could not be any beginning \nto a quest. This initial conception of the telos comes from the amalgamation of the \ninternal goods from individual practices to some notion of the good. But in addition to \nthis, there is within the concept of the quest the idea that it is a search for something \nwhich is not yet \u201cadequately characterised\u201d and that it is through the search that the \ngoal of the quest is finally to be understood. So the telos is both partially known and \nunknown, and in the quest for the unknown, we also refine our understanding of the \nknown (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 218-219). \n \nThis brings us to the concept of the unity of a person\u2019s life, in which a life can be \nconceived of and evaluated only as a whole. But to evaluate a person\u2019s life as a whole \nrequires the context of the relationships they are involved in and the possible shared \nfuture of those relationships \u2013 and this in turn requires that we understand the \u201cstory\u201d \nof that person\u2019s life. \n \nMen and women are narrative animals \u2013 that is, life is lived inside a story of which the \nindividual is the subject, but also in which there are interlocking narratives with others \n(MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 217-218). This is to say that an individual\u2019s story began \nbefore she was born (and will continue after she dies) and that she entered life as part \nof a continuing narrative. It is only within the context of this continuing and \ncommunal narrative that she can make sense of herself and that she can begin to make \nsome sense of her telos. Initially this telos is derived from the experiences of early \nchildhood, but gradually it becomes hers as she embarks on her own narrative quest. \nThus, the narrative quest (\u201cwhere is my story going?\u201d) is both teleological and also \npart of its own answer. In other words, as we have noted, it is not a quest for the \nalready known, but a quest in which the telos will become clearer on the way.  \n \nThis concept of the narrative quest leads MacIntyre to a further refinement of his \ndefinition of the virtues: \n \n\u201cThe virtues therefore are to be understood as those dispositions which \nwill not only sustain practices and enable us to achieve the goods \ninternal to practices, but which will sustain us in the relevant kind of \nquest for the good, by enabling us to overcome the harms, dangers, \ntemptations and distractions which we encounter, and which will \nfurnish us with increasing self-knowledge and increasing knowledge of \nthe good.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 219) \n \nIt is important to emphasise that this sense of telos and the narrative quest is by no \nmeans an individual matter. McCann and Brownsberger summarise MacIntyre well at \nthis point and helpfully link the concepts of practice and community. It is worth \nquoting them at length: \n \n 10\n\u201c\u2026 the normative character of MacIntyre\u2019s definition of a social practice \u2026 is \nsecured within a larger account of the moral life as a whole. There must be \nsome telos to human life, a vision anticipating the moral unity of life, given in \nthe form of a narrative history that has meaning within a particular \ncommunity\u2019s traditions; otherwise the various internal goods generated by the \nrange of social practices will remain disordered and potentially subversive of \none another. Without a community\u2019s shared sense of telos, there will be no \nway of signifying \u2018the overriding good\u2019 by which various internal goods may \nbe ranked and evaluated.\u201d (McCann and Brownsberger 1990: 227-228) \n \nThis, then, affirms the essential intertwining of the individual, and his or her own \nnarrative quest, with the community, and its shared sense of telos. It is in community \nthat the virtues are developed and (partially) for whose good they are exercised. \n \nHowever, this initial virtues-practice schema, in which internal goods attainable at the \nindividual level are to the fore but in the context of community, needs to be extended \nby the addition of the institution that houses the practice \u2013 at which point both \nexternal goods and organisations (as a particular form of institution) enter the frame. \nMacIntyre writes: \n \n\u201cInstitutions are characteristically and necessarily concerned with ... external \ngoods. They are involved in acquiring money and other material goods; they \nare structured in terms of power and status, and they distribute money, power \nand status as rewards. Nor could they do otherwise if they are to sustain not \nonly themselves, but also the practices of which they are the bearers. For no \npractices can survive for any length of time unsustained by institutions. Indeed \nso intimate is the relationship of practices to institutions \u2013 and consequently of \nthe goods external to the goods internal to the practices in question \u2013 that \ninstitutions and practices characteristically form a single causal order in which \nthe ideals and the creativity of the practice are always vulnerable to the \nacquisitiveness of the institution, in which the cooperative care for common \ngoods of the practice is always vulnerable to the competitiveness of the \ninstitution. In this context the essential feature of the virtues is clear. Without \nthem, without justice, courage and truthfulness, practices could not resist the \ncorrupting power of institutions.\u201d (MacIntyre 1985 [1981]: 194) \n \nThus, institutions form an essential part of MacIntyre\u2019s \u2018general theory\u2019. Without \nthem his schema is incomplete. With them we begin to understand why MacIntyre \ntakes such a critical stance towards capitalist organisations \u2013 organisations which in \nhis view have, in effect, \u2018won\u2019 over the practice that is actually at their core and \nwhose justification is the pursuit of the goods of effectiveness. MacIntyre\u2019s critique, \nas we have seen above but expressed now in the terms of his \u2018general theory\u2019, is that \n\u201cmuch modern industrial productive and service work is organised so as to exclude \nthe features distinctive of a practice\u201d and in such a way that this type of activity is \u201cat \nonce alien and antagonistic to practices\u201d (MacIntyre 1994a: 286). Thus, capitalist and \nother bureaucratic organisations fail to provide the kind of conducive environment \nwithin which the virtues may flourish and internal goods (the goods of excellence) \nmay be achieved. \n \n 11\nIt might be thought that, within the context of his \u2018general theory\u2019, MacIntyre would \nhold out some sympathy towards managers, locked as they are inside such capitalist \norganisations. In his 1999 lecture Social structure and their threats to moral agency, \nMacIntyre addresses this by returning both to Eichmann and to the life of managers as \ncompartmentalised selves. He discusses the extent to which social structure \nundermines the development of the type of understanding required by agents to see \nthemselves as having a moral identity distinguishable from their social role(s). \nHowever, his position on the moral responsibility of managers has been amended. \n \nWhereas the 1964 MacIntyre asserts that, \u201c[t]he faceless men of the contemporary \ncorporation are themselves instruments not by virtue of some act of will of their own   \n\u2026 but by virtue of the structure of the corporation\u201d (MacIntyre 1964: 13, emphasis \nadded), such determinism is heavily conditioned in the 1999 account. Here, although \n\u201cthere is indeed a type of social structure that warrants for those who inhabit it a plea \nof diminished responsibility\u201d (MacIntyre 1999a: 325), the plea is not accepted for \nmanagers in contemporary organisations. \n \nDrawing again from the studies of power company executives, MacIntyre\u2019s notion of \ncompartmentalisation sees managers as playing a more active part. The ability to \nchange roles and role requirements as the agent moves between social settings is \nnamed as a peculiarly modern virtue, a \u201cdramatic feat\u201d (MacIntyre 1999a: 326). \nMoreover MacIntyre now asserts that its achievement necessarily involves a \ndeliberate termination of the agent\u2019s practical reasoning in order to resist inescapable \nquestions that might undermine the conduct of the managerial role. For MacIntyre this \nhabitual discipline of intellectual abstinence requires the active co-operation of the \nindividual manager who is thus regarded as a co-author of his or her own divided state \n(MacIntyre 1999a: 327).    \n \n \nMacIntyre in the Organisational Sciences \n \nFrom the publication of After Virtue onwards MacIntyre\u2019s influence and reputation \nhave grown.  This is  replicated in the literatures of a number of professions (for \nexample, Lambeth 1990; Sellman 2000; Leeper and Leeper 2001), in business ethics \n(for example, Beadle 2002; Brewer 1997; Dawson and Bartholomew 2003; Dobson \n1996, 1997, 2001; Horvarth 1995; McCann and Brownsberger 1990; Mintz 1996; \nMoore 2002, 2005a, 2005b; Wicks 1996, 1997) and organisational thought (for \nexample, Alvesson and Willmott 1992; Anthony 1986; Du Gay 1998, 2000; \nMangham 1995).    \n \nThe distinction we draw here between these literatures belies some of their similarities \nbut trends can nevertheless be discerned. The professional literatures commonly \nattempt to establish the relevant profession as a practice, hence Lambeth\u2019s (1990) \nargument in respect of journalism, Sellman\u2019s (2000) for nursing, Brewer\u2019s for \nmanagement (1997), Leeper and Leeper\u2019s (2001) for public relations and most \nrecently Dunne and Hogan (2004) on teaching, a volume of papers animated by the \nrejection of MacIntyre\u2019s view (MacIntyre and Dunne 2002) that teaching is not a \npractice itself, and in which some contributors go almost so far as to assert that \nMacIntyre does not understand his own concept.   \n \n 12\nWhilst each of these papers merits individual consideration a degree of commonality \nis evident. Many engage in the same arguments as one another whilst appearing \nignorant of each other\u2019s existence and of MacIntyre\u2019s work beyond the pages of After \nVirtue. All identify relevant internal goods with the ambition of establishing these as a \nwarrant for awarding their profession the status of a practice. The problem with this \nhowever (and not the only problem for some, see Beadle 2002) is that the \nestablishment of internal goods is a necessary but insufficient condition for the \nidentification of a practice \u2013 the neglected conditions being around the role of the \npractice in the narrative of an individual\u2019s life, the tradition of the community to \nwhich individuals belong and the inter-connected role of institutions. These are \nexactly the conditions that MacIntyre identifies as being absent in teaching where he \nasserts: \n \n \u201cit is part of my claim that teaching is never more than a means, that it has  \n no point and purpose except for the point and purpose of the activities to \nwhich it introduces students. All teaching is for the sake of something else and \nso teaching does not have its own goods. The life of a teacher is therefore not \na specific kind of life.\u201d (MacIntyre and Dunne 2002: 9) \n \nThe project of elevating professions to the status of practices turns on the specificity \nof the kind of life in which practitioners engage and this is just one more reason why \nsmall working communities are the ideal environment for the development of the \npractices and why industrial society, by drawing work outside the context of such \ncommunities and households, is so destructive of them (MacIntyre: 1985 [1981]: \n229).   \n \nThe ongoing contestability of MacIntyre\u2019s concept of a practice is problematic \nhowever. In part this is MacIntyre\u2019s own fault.  The paucity of his organisational \nexamples and the ambiguity of his definition (Miller 1994) perhaps encourages the \nrationally interminable debate, of which he has written in other contexts, to be a \nfeature of arguments about his own work. \n \nThe business ethics literature runs up against a somewhat different range of \nconceptual and practical difficulties (Knight 1994: 283). In his paper Does applied \nethics rest on a mistake? (1984) MacIntyre\u2019s affirmative answer appears to rule out \nany normative business ethics for sharing with other areas of applied ethics a falsely \nelevated notion of the philosophical importance of immediate factual context. This \nhas not put business ethicists off, however. Horvarth (1995) goes so far as to argue \nthat a MacIntyre-style Virtue Ethics should become the paradigm for business ethics, \napplying MacIntyre\u2019s critiques of Enlightenment thinking to suggest that utilitarian \nand deontological approaches provide inadequate bases for business ethics, whilst \nlargely sidestepping MacIntyre\u2019s own condemnation of corporate modernity. \nSimilarly, McCann and Brownsberger (1990) argue that business can be a context for \nthe development of the virtues. A contest between Dobson and Wicks in their 1996 \nand 1997 papers broadly turned on the justification for MacIntyre\u2019s condemnation of \ncapitalism, an issue revisited by Beadle (2002) and Moore (2002) and summarised by \nDobson and Bartholomew (2003).   \n \nThe literature we broadly identify as falling within organisational theory has been \nmore critical of MacIntyre and in particular of his condemnation of management.  \n 13\nAnthony (1996) argues that MacIntyre mistakes the activity of management with \nWeber\u2019s characterisation of it (174-180), while Du Gay\u2019s (1998, 2000) criticism is \neffectively a justification of context-specific rationalities such as that established by \nWeber for management (though Tester (2000) argues from the opposite perspective \nthat MacIntyre does not so much oppose as misreads Weber). The critical \nmanagement literature tends to cite MacIntyre loosely as a fellow traveller (Alvesson \nand Willmott 1992) in the condemnation of management and capitalism while \nignoring his opposition to their post-modern epistemology, though Mangham (1995) \nis an exception. \n \nConclusion  \n \nThis paper has attempted to show that MacIntyre\u2019s judgments on the bureaucratic \norganisations that characterise the institutional form of modernity have remained \nconsistent from the 1950s. What has developed is a theory for authoritatively \njustifying these judgements \u2013 a theory both about capitalism and about why it is \nwrong. MacIntyre established the centrality of the task of authoritatively justifying \nMarxism\u2019s condemnation of capitalism as early as 1953 (MacIntyre 1995 [1953]) and \nits notion of human life unencumbered by capitalism in 1965 (reprinted in MacIntyre \n1978 [1971]: 66). \n \nIts resolution has required the development of both a substantive notion of human \nnature to which the virtues are central (MacIntyre 1985 [1981], 1999b) and a theory \ndemonstrating their systematic dependence on a form of institutionalisation alien to \nthe dominant forms of corporate modernity whether public or private sector. Indeed \nMurphy sees the vindication of MacIntyre\u2019s condemnation of capitalism as the central \ntask of MacIntyre\u2019s work (Murphy 2003: 7). In developing this latter argument \nMacIntyre has critiqued both the effects of corporate modernity and its conceptual \nconfusions (MacIntyre 1977b, 1979 and 1985 [1981]).  The relationship between \nthese is intimate but the responsibility of individual managers for their own vice is \nclearer in more recent work (MacIntyre 1999a) than in earlier representations. \n \nDeveloping MacIntyre\u2019s ideas in the context of organisations has, however, run up \nagainst a series of obstacles and the application of MacIntyre\u2019s work evidences the \ntype of rational interminability (and indeed repetitiveness) that MacIntyre regards as \nemblematic of modern moral dialogue as a whole. The problem of applying \nMacIntyre\u2019s concepts, as he himself has admitted, is that a great deal more needs to be \nsaid about the concept of a practice and the idea of internal goods than has been said \nso far (Reddiford and Watts Miller 1991: 273-274). The dispute over the status of \nteaching is emblematic of the uses to which the definitions he has given can be put. \nEqually those who contest his condemnation of capitalism and those who support it \nappear locked in interminable struggle. \n \nWhat is also evident is the lack of empirical work undertaken using MacIntyre\u2019s \nconcepts. This sits oddly with his emphasis on practice and with the clear task of \nfilling in the gaps in the dynamic aspects of his theory. MacIntyre has, as we noted \nabove, maintained that social theory should embody features of practical social life \nand that the proper purpose of theory is to develop better understandings of that life.  \nMuch more needs to be done to establish how the virtues work (literally) in practice to \n 14\nenable the creation of internal goods and how such development is corrupted by the \nlure of external goods.   \n \n \nReferences \n \nAchtemeier, P.M. 1994. \u2018The truth of tradition: Critical Realism in the thought of \nAlasdair MacIntyre and T.F.
