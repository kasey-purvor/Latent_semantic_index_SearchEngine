The stochastic web concept dates back to the early 1960s\nwhen Arnold showed [2] that, in non-degenerate Hamiltonian systems of dimension\nexceeding 2, resonance lines necessarily intersect, forming a web of infinite-size in the\nPoincar\u00e9 section. It provides in turn for a slow chaotic (sometimes called \u201cstochastic\u201d)\ndiffusion over infinite distances in the relevant dynamical variables.\nIt was discovered at the end of 1980s [3-5] that, in degenerate or nearly degenerate\nsystems, stochastic webs can arise even for dimension 3\/2. An archetypal example of\nsuch a low-dimensional stochastic web arises when a 1D harmonic oscillator is perturbed\nby a weak traveling wave whose frequency coincides with a multiple of the natural\nfrequency of the oscillator [1, 4, 6]. Perturbation plays a dual role: on the one hand, it\ngives rise to a slow dynamics characterized by an auxiliary Hamiltonian that possesses\nan infinite web-like separatrix; on the other hand, the perturbation destroys this self-\ngenerated separatrix, replacing it with a thin chaotic layer. Such a low-dimensional\nstochastic web may be relevant to a variety of physical systems and plays an important\nrole in the corresponding transport phenomena: see [1, 4, 6] for reviews on relevant\nclassical systems. There are also quantum systems the dynamics of whose transport\nreduces to that of the classical model described above. One example is a nanometre-scale\nsemiconductor superlattice with an applied voltage and magnetic field [7, 8]. Moreover,\nthere is evidence that, if a classical system possesses a stochastic web, then transport in\nthe quantum analogue of that system is much stronger than where the classical system\ndoes not possesses a web [9, 10], a finding that may be relevant e.g. to the transport of\nultra-cold atoms in optical lattices [9].\nOne might assume that, like the Arnold web, the low-dimensional stochastic web\ndescribed above should be infinite, so that it would provide for transport between the\ncentre of the web and states situated arbitrarily distant in coordinate and momentum.\nHowever this is not the case. Provided that the perturbation is not exponentially strong,\nthe real web is confined to the region within just a few inner loops of the infinite web-like\nresonant separatrix (cf. [1, 4, 6]). The reason is as follows. The resonant Hamiltonian\npossesses a single, infinite, web-like separatrix only in the first-order approximation of\nthe averaging method [11]; with account taken of the next-order approximations, the\nseparatrix splits into many separate complex loops successively embedded within each\nother. Non-resonant terms of the perturbation dress the separatrices by exponentially\nnarrow chaotic layers. If the perturbation is not small, the chaotic layers manage to\nconnect neighbouring separatrix loops situated close to the centre. However, the width\nof the chaotic layer decreases exponentially fast with increasing distance from the centre\n[1, 4, 6]. As a result, coalescence of the chaotic layers associated with adjacent loops\nonly occurs among the few loops closest to the centre.\nIf the resonance between the perturbation and the oscillator is inexact, or if the\noscillator is nonlinear, the separation of neighbouring loops is typically much larger:\nit is already apparent in the first-order approximation of the averaging method [1, 5, 6].\nSo, the number of the loops connected to the centre by chaotic transport is even smaller\n[1, 5, 6] than in the case of an exact resonance.\nHow can one modify the perturbation in order that the transport should become\nunlimited or, at least, significantly extended? One possible answer was obtained at the\nvery beginning of the studies of low-dimensional webs [3]: if the perturbation consists of\nshort kicks that are periodic in space and time, and if the frequency of the kicks is equal\nto a multiple of the natural frequency, then a so called uniform web is formed covering\nthe whole phase space. Such a perturbation seldom applies in practice, however, and\neven where it does the chaotic transport is still exponentially slow [1, 6].\nIs it possible to obtain a web of form similar to the original one [4] but substantially\nextended in the phase space? Our present work leads to a positive answer based on the\nfollowing simple idea. The chaotic layer in the web is exponentially narrow because the\nfrequency of the non-resonant perturbation of the resonant Hamiltonian is necessarily\nmuch higher than the frequency of small eigenoscillations in the cell of the web-like\nseparatrix [1,3-6]. So, we need to modify the perturbation in such a way that the\nresonant Hamiltonian does not change while its perturbation contains, in addition to\nthe conventional terms, a low-frequency one. One may do this by modulating the wave\nangle at a low frequency or by adding one more wave of frequency shifted slightly\nfrom the original one. The latter option will be considered elsewhere together with\na generalization for the uniform web (leading to a huge enhancement of the chaotic\ntransport through it). Our present work concentrates on the first option since it may have\nimmediate applications to nanometre-scale semiconductor superlattices in electric and\nmagnetic fields [7, 8].\nSLOW MODULATION OF THE WAVE ANGLE\nFig. 1 demonstrates the efficiency of our method. We integrate the equation\nq\u00a8+q = 0.1sin[15q\u22124t\u2212hsin(0.02t)], (1)\nfirst for h= 0 (i.e. for the conventional case with parameters as in [1, 4, 6]), and secondly\nfor h = 0.1. Although the modulation in the latter case is weak (its amplitude is small\ncompared to the 2pi period of the wave angle), the resultant increase in size of the web\nin coordinate and momentum is large: a factor of about 6\u00d7.\nTo account for these results we develop the analytic theory, generalized for the off-\nresonant case [1, 5, 6], using a general method developed recently in [12]. It is antici-\npated that the method can also be generalized for uniform webs [1, 3, 6], leading to an\nexponentially strong enhancement of chaotic transport through them.\nFIGURE 1. The Poincar\u00e9 section for a trajectory of the system (1) with initial state q = 0.1, q\u02d9 = 0\n(at instants tn = nT where T \u2261 2pi\/0.02 is the period of the modulation and n = 1,2,3, ...600000) for\nh = 0 (left panel) and h = 0.1 (right panel). A symplectic integration scheme of the fourth order is used,\nwith an integration step tint = 2pi40000 \u2248 1.57\u00d7 10\u22124, so that the inaccuracy at each step is of the order of\nt5int \u2248\u00d710\u221219. The left panel corresponds to the conventional case considered in [1, 4, 6]. The right panel\ndemonstrates that the modulation, although weak, greatly enlarges the web sizes (note the different axes\nscales), thereby greatly enhancing the chaotic transport.\nAPPLICATION TO SEMICONDUCTOR SUPERLATTICES\nWe now consider application to quantum electron transport in nanometre-scale 1D\nsemiconductor superlattices (SLs) subject to a constant electric field along the SL axis\nand to a constant magnetic field [7, 8]. The spatial periodicity gives rise to minibands for\nthe electrons. In the tight-binding approximation, the electron\u2019s energy E as a function\nof its momentum ~p in the lowest miniband is given by\nE(~p) =\n\u2206[1\u2212 cos(pxd\/h\u00af)]\n2\n+\np2y + p\n2\nz\n2m\u2217\n, (2)\nwhere x is the direction along the SL axis, \u2206 is the miniband width, d is the SL period,\nm\u2217 is the electron effective mass for the motion in the transversal (i.e. y\u2212 z) direction.\nThus, the quasi-classical motion of an electron of charge e in an electric field ~F and a\nmagnetic field ~B is described by:\nd~p\ndt\n=\u2212e{~F +[\u2207~pE(~p)\u00d7~B]}. (3)\nIt was shown in [7] that, for constant electric field along the SL axis ~F = (\u2212F0,0,0) and\nconstant magnetic field with a given angle \u03b8 to the axis ~B = (Bcos(\u03b8),0,Bsin(\u03b8)), the\ndynamics of the z-component of momentum pz reduces to the equation of motion of an\nauxiliary harmonic oscillator in a plane wave. At certain values of the parameters, the\nratio of the wave and oscillator frequencies takes integer values (as in Eq. (1) with h= 0)\ngiving rise to the onset of the stochastic web. This leads in turn to a delocalization of the\nelectron in the x-direction and, consequently, to an increase of the dc-conductivity along\nthe SL axis. The experiment [8] appears to provide evidence in favor of this exciting\nhypothesis.\nAt the same time, the finite size of the web and, yet more so, the exponentially fast\ndecrease of the transport rate as the distance from the centre of the web increases, seem\nto place strong limitations on the use of the effect. We now suggest a simple and efficient\nway to overcome these limitations: if we add to the original (constant) electric field F0\na small time-periodic (ac) component Fac cos(\u2126act), then the wave angle in the equation\nof motion of pz is modulated by the following term (cf. Eq. (1)):\nhcos(\u2126t)\u2261 Fac\nF0\n\u21260\n\u2126ac\ncos\n(\n\u2126ac\n\u21260\nt\n)\n, \u21260 \u2261 eF0dh\u00af . (4)\nThis allows us to increase drastically the size of the web and the rate of chaotic transport\nthrough it. For example, for the case shown in Fig. 1, where we have an increase of the\nweb size by the factor of 6\u00d7, it is sufficient to add an ac component of electric field of\nfrequency 0.02\u00d7\u21260 and amplitude Fac = 0.1\u00d70.02\u00d7F0, i.e. an amplitude that is 500\u00d7\nsmaller than the original constant field F0!\nREFERENCES\n1.
