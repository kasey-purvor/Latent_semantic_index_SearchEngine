Much has been learned about their structures in recent years, leading to\nintensive, fundamental, and applied research in both biology and physics. How ion\nchannels are able to conduct selectively at rates comparable to free diffusion is still not\nwell understood, despite intensive and ever-growing research. In this paper, we discuss\nthe influence of charge fluctuations on an ion\u2019s transition through the channel. The\nmodel is used for comparison with experimental measurements of the single-channel\nGramicidin current at different concentrations. The theory allows for the dependence\nof the interfacial concentration on the applied potential across the lipid bilayer, and is\ntherefore able to reproduce the ion channel\u2019s fast conduction self-consistently. By taking\ninto account the access resistance to the channel, we are able to observe the saturation of\nthe current at higher concentrations. We consider the problem in three steps: (i) definition\nof the boundary conditions in a self-consistent manner, using coupled solutions of the\nPoisson and Nernst-Planck (NP) equations in the channel and in the bulk; (ii) theory of\nthe transition rate through the channel in the presence of fluctuations; and finally (iii)\ncomparison with experiment.\nMETHODOLOGY\nWe use self-consistent Poisson and Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations\n\u2207 \u00b7 [\u03b5(r)\u2207\u03c6\u02dc(r)] =\u2212\n[\nN\n\u2211\ni=1\nz jen\u02dc j(r)+ ep\u02dcex(r)\n]\n, (1)\nand combine them with the drift-diffusion NP equation to accommodate the flux of\nmobile ions\n\u2202 n\u02dc j(r, t)\n\u2202 t\n=\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 J\u02dc j = 0, ( j = 1, ...,N),\nJ\u02dc j =\u2212D j(r)\n[\n\u2207n\u02dc j +\nz je\nkBT\nn\u02dc j(r)\u2207\u03c6\u02dc\n]\n. (2)\nThe potential and the concentrations are thus determined in the bulk (i.e. away from) and\nclose to the mouth of the channel with boundary conditions set at infinity [1]. The PNP\nequation inside the channel is solved analytically. The solutions obtained in the bulk and\nin the pore are then combined using an iterative procedure. The current and potential\ngradient calculated in the pore are utilised to set boundary conditions for the solution\nin the bulk. The bulk solution is in turn used to set the boundary conditions of the PNP\nequation in the pore, until convergence is achieved.\nWe use a 1D approximation of the Poisson equation inside the channel. Applying\nBrownian dynamics (BD) simulations of ions in the solutions\nmi~\u00a8xi = \u2212mi\u03b3i~\u02d9xi+\n[\nqiq j\n4pi\u03b5\u03b50r2i j\n+\n9U0R9c\nr10i j\n(3)\n+AU0 exp\n(\nRi j\u2212 ri j\nae\n)\nsin\n(\n2pi\nRi j\u2212 ri j\naw\n\u2212\u03b1\n)]\n~ri j\nri j\n+~Fch+\n\u221a\n2mi\u03b3ikBT~\u03bei(t),\nwe determine their arrival distribution at the channel mouth. It has been shown that this\ncorresponds to a Poisson distribution [2]. Having estimated the arrival rates of ions at the\nchannel mouth, we use this information to develop a theory of the transition rate through\nthe channel. We assume that the channel is occupied most of the time by only one ion,\nand that the transition rate of ions through the channel is mainly determined by escape\nover the potential barrier at the selectivity site. Therefore the effect of the many-body ion\ndynamics in the bulk on ion motion in the channel is twofold: (i) a delivery of the ions to\nthe channel mouth and (ii) modulation of the channel potential by the charge fluctuations\nat the channel mouth. Under these physiologically plausible assumptions we separate the\nion motion in the channel from the many-body ion dynamics in the bulk. The resultant\nion dynamics in the channel may be described by the overdamped Langevin equation,\nm\u03b3 x\u02d9 =\u2212dV (x, t)\ndx\n+\n\u221a\n2m\u03b3kBT \u03be (t), (4)\nwhere the potential V (x, t) has three main contributions: (i) the potential of Coulomb\ninteraction with ions in the bulk solution VC; (ii) the electrostatic potential induced by\ninteraction with the channel protein Vch; (iii) the potential of Coulomb interaction with\nthe wall charge at the selectivity site. By an averaging procedure, the effect of multi-ion\nmotion in the bulk solution is reduced to Coulomb interaction with ions arriving at the\nchannel mouth. The latter process can be viewed as a stochastic Poisson process or as\nshot noise that modulates the potential barrier for the conducting ion at the selectivity\nsite. We estimate analytically the effect of this potential modulation on the channel\nconductivity. To quantify the effect of multi-ion motion in the bulk on the conducting\nion at the selectivity site, we have simulated the ion\u2019s Brownian dynamics in the bulk.\nThe mean arrival time for Na+ and Cl\u2212 ions at the channel mouth (approximated\nas a cylindrical section of radius R and length R) are \u03c4+ = 365 ps and \u03c4\u2212 = 471 ps\nrespectively. These estimates are in agreement with the theoretical estimates in [4]\n\u03c4arrival =\n1\n2picDR\n(5)\nwhere c is the ion concentration and D is the diffusion coefficient. The time evolution\nof the charge in the channel mouth is a Poisson process with the three main states +1e,\n0, and \u22121e Fig. 1(left). As a first approximation we divided the states of the channel\npotential affected by the charge fluctuations into two effective states: (i) a state of high\nconductivity, corresponding to +1e, and (ii) a state of low conductivity, corresponding\nto a charge of either 0 or \u22121e at the channel mouth. In this approximation the effect of\nthree states of the potential is taken into account by asymmetry of the transition rates\nbetween the two effective states. The corresponding transition rates can be estimated\nas \u03b1\u00b1 = 1\/\u3008T\u00b1\u3009, where \u3008T\u00b1\u3009 are mean residence time of two effective states, giving\n(\u03b1+)\u22121 = 0.22 ns and (\u03b1\u2212)\u22121 = 0.38 ns. The occupation probabilities of these two\nstates are 0.36 and 0.64 respectively.\nThe effect of charge fluctuations on the channel potential is estimated by solving the\nPoisson equation for various positions of the conducting ion along the channel axis in\nthe two cases: (i) when there are no other ions at the channel entrances; (ii) when there\nis one positive ion at the left entrance to the channel.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION\nOur self-consistent 1D solutions of the PNP equations in the bulk and inside the channel\nallow us to determine the potential and concentration in both the bulk and the channel.\nOn this basis, we have reconstructed the statistical properties of the charge fluctuations\nfrom 3D Brownian dynamics simulations of multi-ion motion in the bulk solution, as\nshown in Fig. 1(left). We find that the distributions of ion arrival times at the channel\nmouth are exponential. These charge fluctuations strongly modulate the potential barrier\nfor the conducting ion at the selectivity site due to amplification of electrostatic interac-\ntions in long narrow channels of low dielectric constant. These findings have allowed us\nto model the mean ion transition time through the channel as an ionic escape from the\npotential well at the selectivity site induced by thermal fluctuations and by modulation\nof the height of the barrier by stochastic Poisson processes.\nWe can compare our simulation results with the experimental measurements of the\nion current in the Gramicidin channel performed by Andersen et al. [3] in the range\nof concentrations 50 mM to 2M. Fits to the experimental data for two values of the\napplied potential 75 mV and 100 mV are shown in Fig. 1(right). It can be seen from\nthe figure that the experimental data exhibit a significant saturation of the ion current\nas a function of concentration, a dependence that is well-reproduced in our simulations.\nA more accurate model that takes into account the 3 states of the potential is currently\nunder development.\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n\u22122\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\nt, ns\nCh\nar\nge\n, e\n0.01 0.1 1 2\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n2\nI (p\nA)\nC (M)\n100mV\n75mV\n65mV\n110mV\nFIGURE 1.
