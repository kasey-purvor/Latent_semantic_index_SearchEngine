They also suggest that stress gradient coupling is ineffective at transmitting\nbasal motion anomalies to the upper part of the glacier, in contrast to findings from an\nearlier flow line study at the same glacier. We suggest that stress gradient coupling is\nlimited through the effect of high drag imposed by a partially frozen bed and friction\ninduced by valley walls and significant topographic pinning points. Our findings imply\nthat stress gradient coupling may play a limited role in transmitting supraglacially forced\nbasal motion anomalies through Arctic valley and outlet glaciers with complex\ntopographic settings and highlight the importance of dynamically incorporating basal\nmotion into models predicting the response of the Arctic\u2019s land ice to climate change.\nCitation: Bingham, R.

Introduction\n[2] Intra-annual variations in ice motion, with higher\nvelocities during the melt season, have been observed at\nseveral predominantly cold polythermal glaciers [Bingham\net al., 2003; Mu\u00a8ller and Iken, 1973; Rabus and Echelmeyer,\n1997; Rippin et al., 2005] including the Greenland Ice Sheet\n[Zwally et al., 2002]. Such seasonal speedups have typically\nbeen attributed to \u2018\u2018supraglacial hydraulic forcing,\u2019\u2019 the\neffect of supraglacial meltwater penetrating to the glacier\nbed and generating excess basal water pressures (or reduced\nbasal friction) and enhanced basal motion [Bingham et al.,\n2005; Zwally et al., 2002]. These processes offer significant\npotential to accelerate the response of ice masses to climate\nwarming by facilitating the rapid transmission of increasing\nvolumes of surface runoff to the subglacial hydraulic\nsystem, thereby potentially increasing basal motion and\nraising the overall rate of ice flux to lower elevations\n[Parizek and Alley, 2004; Rignot and Kanagaratnam,\n2006]. The concern is particularly acute over the High\nArctic (>75\u0001N), where substantial warming and correspond-\ning increases in surface melting have been observed over\nthe last two decades [Abdalati and Steffen, 2001; Hanna\net al., 2005; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC), 2007; Steffen et al., 2004], and many glaciers\nterminate offshore, where calving provides an efficient mass\nsink through which ice loss is translated rapidly into sea\nlevel rise. However, most current models used to project the\ncontribution to sea level from the High Arctic\u2019s land ice do\nnot incorporate any dynamic feedbacks in response to\nincreased melt rates [Alley et al., 2005; IPCC, 2007; Rignot\nand Kanagaratnam, 2006], due in part to limited knowl-\nedge of the mechanism(s) by which supraglacial water\npenetrates to the base and induce(s) a dynamic response.\nRare exceptions to date are Parizek and Alley\u2019s [2004]\nsimulations of the Greenland Ice Sheet\u2019s response to three\ndifferent global warming scenarios incorporating seasonally\nenhanced basal motion, and Pattyn et al.\u2019s [2005] model\nof polythermal McCall Glacier, Alaska, which highlights\nthe potential significance of basal motion for the annual\nflow regime.\n[3] Recent research by van der Veen [2007] has shown\ntheoretically that supraglacial-subglacial connections can be\nestablished through ice several hundreds of meters thick\nover periods of only a few hours by the water-driven\npropagation of crevasses.

The mechanism\nhas been observed directly at John Evans Glacier, Canada\n[Boon and Sharp, 2003]; and satellite observations of supra-\nglacial lakes forming and draining seasonally over the\nGreenland Ice Sheet imply its wider occurrence [McMillan\net al., 2007; Sneed and Hamilton, 2007]. These findings\nconfirm that supraglacial hydraulic forcing is likely in the\nHigh Arctic, but the requirement for surface water to\novercome the thermal barrier of cold ice at the surface means\nit occurs via far fewer and more widely spaced supraglacial-\nsubglacial connections than on temperate glaciers. In a\ntypical temperate glacier, supraglacial hydraulic forcing\ncauses speedups in basal motion where supraglacial inputs\nlocally reduce basal traction; this then alters the stress fields\nin the surrounding ice, such that the initial speedup is\ntransmitted through the ice to the surface and adjacent\nregions by stress gradient coupling [Blatter et al., 1998;\nNienow et al., 2005]. What remains unclear in High Arctic\nice masses is the extent to which meltwater inputs limited to\nfewer and more widely spaced locations can cause either\nlocalized or more spatially extensive speedup events.\n[4] In this paper, we investigate seasonal variations in the\ndistribution of basal sliding under a polythermal (predom-\ninantly cold) High Arctic glacier, and their effects on the\noverall flow regime. More specifically, we use an existing\nthree-dimensional, finite difference glacier flow model\n[Blatter, 1995; Hubbard et al., 1998] to assess the extent\nto which localized perturbations in basal traction, such as\nthose typically provided by supraglacial hydraulic forcing,\ncan be transmitted through such a glacier by stress gradient\ncoupling, particularly along the (longitudinal) direction of\nthemain flow line.We apply themodel to JohnEvansGlacier,\nNunavut, Canada, where detailed field measurements of ice\nmotion and hydrologywere obtained between 1994 and 2002.\nIn doing so, we aim to improve the current understanding of\nthe length scales of stress gradient coupling in predominantly\ncold ice masses, which has important implications for the\nresponse of High Arctic glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet\nto supraglacial hydraulic forcing.\n2. Background and Methodology\n2.1. Physical Setting\n[5] John Evans Glacier (79\u0001400N, 74\u0001000W; hereafter\nJEG) covers 165 km2 and flows 15 km from an altitude of\n1500 m to terminate on land at 100 m above sea level (a.s.l.)\nnear the head of Allman Bay, eastern Ellesmere Island\n(Figure 1a). Ground-based radio echo sounding (RES),\nconducted at 3200 points across the glacier, has been used\nto determine its thickness and basal thermal conditions\n[Copland and Sharp, 2001]. Over the lower ablation zone\n(LABZ; 0\u20135 km above the terminus), the lower accumula-\ntion zone (LACZ; 8\u201311 km above the terminus) and the\nupper accumulation zone (UACZ; 11\u201315 km above the\nterminus), ice is typically 100\u2013200 m thick. Over the upper\nablation zone (UABZ; 5\u20138 km above the terminus) ice\nattains depths up to 400 m, and flows across an overdeep-\nened trough (Figure 1b). At the upper boundary of the\nUABZ, i.e., approximately at the equilibrium line altitude\n(ELA; 8 km above the terminus and 800 m a.s.l.), ice flows\neither side of a nunatak, while at the lower limit of the UABZ\n(4 km above the terminus) the ice thins significantly over a\nsubglacial bedrock riegel (Figure 1b). Thermal conditions\nwere determined by analyzing all traces for residual bed\nreflection power (BRPr), the bed reflection power corrected\nfor ice thickness, for which values >1 generally indicate\nwarm basal ice [after Gades et al., 2000]. Over most of the\nablation zone, but not at the margins and terminus, high\nBRPr (Figure 1c) indicates warm basal ice. In the LABZ an\ninternal reflector up to 40 m above the bed was interpreted as\nthe boundary between warm basal ice and cold overlying ice\n[Copland and Sharp, 2001]. Throughout the whole accumu-\nlation zone and over the margins, terminus and riegel, low\nBRPr (Figure 1c) implies cold basal ice. Thermistors\nemplaced 15 m below the ice surface across the glacier\nyielded values ranging from \u20139.5\u0001C to \u201315.1\u0001C (Figure 1c),\nconfirming that surface ice remains cold all year round.\nResults from the radar survey therefore suggest the glacier\nis polythermal but almost entirely cold, with warm ice only\ndetected at and near the ice bed interface within the ablation\nzone (Figure 1d). Hereafter we use the phrase \u2018\u2018predomi-\nnantly cold\u2019\u2019 to describe the thermal regime of JEG, to\ndistinguish it amongst the full continuum of polythermal\nregimes which can exhibit widely contrasting hydrology\/\ndynamics relationships (see Blatter and Hutter [1991] for a\nrange of polythermal regimes; JEG manifests the form\nshown in their Figure 1d).\n2.2. Observed Motion Patterns\n[6] Measurements of glacier surface motion between\n1998 and 2002 [Bingham et al., 2003; Copland et al.,\n2003b] reveal an annual pattern of ice motion with fastest\nflow (\u000320 m a\u00011) in the LABZ (Figure 2a). Superimposed\nonto this pattern is a more complex picture of glacier-wide\nseasonal variations in ice motion (Figures 2b\u20132d). In\nparticular, we identify three key periods of the year over\nwhich distinct motion distributions are observed (as\nreported in more detail by Bingham et al. [2003]). These\nperiods may be summarized as follows.\n[7] 1. Winter (September\u2013May; Figure 2b). During this\nperiod, there is very little, if any, surface melting, no surface\nrunoff reaches the base, and there is no subglacial outflow.\nIce flows more slowly at this time of year across all parts of\nthe glacier than at any other time.\n[8] 2. Spring (mid-June to late June; Figure 2c). Over the\nmonth preceding this period, surface melt is generated down\nglacier of the ELA. In the LABZ it drains over the surface to\nthe margins, but in the UABZ most drains instead into a\nseries of surface ponds. The beginning of \u2018\u2018spring\u2019\u2019 is\ndefined by the sudden drainage of these surface melt ponds\ninto the glacier interior via five moulins that open over the\nriegel at the lower limit of the UABZ (h1\u2013h5, Figure 1a;\nalso cf. Figure 2c), and a corresponding outburst of melt-\nwater from the subglacial outlet at the terminus which\ntypically occurs 1\u20132 days later. Surface motion across the\nLABZ dramatically increases at this time, often exceeding\ntwice the mean annual speed during the first 2\u20133 days\n[Copland et al., 2003a; Bingham et al., 2006], after which it\nslows but remains around 1.2\u20131.5 times winter speeds.\nSurface motion also increases over the UABZ and the\nLACZ, but no increase in surface motion is observed over\nthe UACZ.\n[9] 3. Summer (July; Figure 2d). During this period, the\nsnow line retreats into the UACZ, and surface runoff occurs\nF02006 BINGHAM ET AL.: HIGH ARCTIC GLACIER SEASONAL DYNAMICS\n2 of 13\nF02006\nwidely across the glacier. Supraglacial melt continues to\ndrain into the five riegel moulins (h1\u2013h5), but much up-\nglacier melt now drains into the glacier interior via two\nfurther moulins (h6 and h7) which open 11 km above the\nterminus (i.e., defining the boundary between the LACZ\nand the UACZ). Peak seasonal flow velocities are observed\nthroughout the UABZ and LACZ; flow increases above\nwinter levels in the UACZ; and high flow continues across\nthe LABZ.\n[10] The higher velocities observed across the glacier\nduring spring and summer undoubtedly result from supra-\nglacial hydraulic forcing. In particular, faster ice motion\nthrough the LABZ during spring is associated with wide-\nspread surface uplift over the same region [Copland et al.,\n2003a; Bingham et al., 2006], and is consistent with surface\nmelt suddenly gaining access to an inefficient subglacial\ndrainage system via the freshly opened riegel moulins\n[Bingham et al., 2005]. However, what is not clear is the\nextent to which this localized dynamic response down\nglacier of the riegel is transmitted up glacier through stress\ngradient coupling. Copland et al. [2003b], using a single\nflow line model, postulated that supraglacial hydraulic\nforcing beneath the LABZ was sufficient to draw down\nice from the accumulation zone provided the longitudinal\ncoupling length exceeded 4 times the ice thickness. They\nsupported this assertion with the theoretical inference that\nlongitudinal coupling is significantly more effective in cold\nice than temperate ice [Kamb and Echelmeyer, 1986]. Since\nthat interpretation, however, a number of issues have arisen.\nFirst, Copland et al. [2003b] compared winter motion only\nwith \u2018\u2018summer\u2019\u2019 motion, where their definition of \u2018\u2018sum-\nmer\u2019\u2019 comprised an amalgamated period combining the\nFigure 1.

As we\nhave seen, the glacier\u2019s dynamic response, and probably\ntherefore the nature of its forcing\/coupling mechanisms,\nevolves markedly as the melt season progresses, most\nnotably up glacier of the LABZ (cf. Figures 2c and 2d).\nSecond, they neglected the existence of the accumulation\nzone moulins (h6 and h7 at the head of the LACZ), whose\nconnectivity to the subglacial outlet has been confirmed by\ndye tracing [Bingham et al., 2005]. The existence of these\nhigher-altitude moulins raises the possibility that supra-\nglacial hydraulic forcing may impact directly on basal\nsliding some way up glacier of the riegel moulins (i.e.,\nacross the LACZ and\/or the UABZ), so that we do not\nnecessarily need to appeal to extensive longitudinal cou-\npling with supraglacial hydraulic forcing further down\nglacier (as do Copland et al. [2003b]). Finally, Bingham\net al. [2005] have demonstrated that the subglacial drainage\nsystem beneath the LABZ can evolve rapidly into a highly\nefficient configuration in the days following the spring\nevent, reducing the impact of supraglacial hydraulic forcing\non basal motion across the LABZ later in the summer.\n[11] Here we attempt to resolve the seasonal distribution\nof basal sliding, and reassess the possible glacier-wide\nimpact of localized perturbations in basal sliding rate via\nlongitudinal stresses, using a fully three-dimensional, finite\nFigure 2.

Model Description\n[12] The model is based on that developed by Blatter\n[1995], which provides first-order solutions to the mass\nbalance and force balance equations for three-dimensional\ngrounded ice masses in steady state. Model derivation,\nnumerical implementation, proof through comparison with\nan idealized case solution, and its application to studying\nbasal motion beneath the temperate Haut Glacier d\u2019Arolla\nare given by Blatter [1995], Blatter et al. [1998], Colinge\nand Blatter [1998], Hubbard et al. [1998], and Nienow et al.\n[2005], respectively. The model has been validated in a\nrecent Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for Higher-\nOrder Models (ISMIP-HOM) [Pattyn et al., 2007] for both\nreal and hypothetical glacier geometries with a variety of\nfixed and mixed basal boundary conditions. It calculates\nlongitudinal and lateral stress gradients, handles a nonlinear\nconstitutive relation and calculates the steady state stress\nand velocity fields for a given geometry and a prescribed\nvelocity or traction distribution at the glacier bed and a\nvanishing shear traction at the surface. It does not explicitly\nincorporate a physical description of the mechanisms that\ninduce spatial variations in basal drag (such as supraglacial\nhydraulic forcing); rather, the model is used heuristically to\nderive the thermal and basal motion fields that replicate the\nobserved surface flow fields, and interpret the likely mech-\nanisms which may bring about the optimum basal velocities\nretrospectively in the context of the field observations\ndescribed above.\n[13] The model is fully thermodynamic and the computed\nthree-dimensional stress field is coupled to strain rates\nthrough a constitutive relation which takes the form of\nGlen\u2019s law given by\nD \u00bc A IP \u00fe t0\u00f0 \u00de n\u00011\u00f0 \u00de=2S\nwhere D is the strain rate tensor, A is the \u2018\u2018rate factor,\u2019\u2019 IP is\nthe second invariant of the stress deviator (S), n is the flow\nlaw exponent (taken as 3), and t0 is a nominally small\nconstant which ensures a finite viscosity is retained when\napproaching the limit of zero stress at ice divides [Blatter,\n1995]. Specifically, the thermal regime couples to the\nrate factor, A, which can be treated as a constant for\nisothermal conditions, or can vary as a function of\ntemperature (or other physical qualities) following the\nArrhenius relation [Paterson, 1994, p. 86]. For simulating\npolythermal conditions, the model calculates the three-\ndimensional temperature field on the basis of horizontal and\nvertical advection, conduction and internal strain and basal\nfrictional heating which are explicitly coupled to the\nmechanical component. Upper and lower boundary condi-\ntions are provided by the mean annual surface temperature\n(obtained from thermistor measurements 15 m beneath the\nglacier surface; Figure 1c) and the geothermal heat flux\nwhich is assumed constant across the bed. The thermal\ncomponent of the model is spun-up under an initial\ncondition of isothermal ice (\u0003\u000110\u0001C) which is iterated\nthrough time in consort with the ice mechanics until the\nthermomechanical regime attains equilibrium. Sensitivity\nexperiments reveal that the result is robust and independent\nof the initial spin-up condition, though initiating with colder\n(\u0003\u000112\u0001C) rather than warmer ice leads to a quicker steady\nstate solution.\n[14] The model requires six inputs: bed and surface\nslopes, surface temperature, ice thickness, the basal motion\nfield and the geothermal heat flux. The model is run at\n250 m horizontal grid resolution, with the glacier geometry\n(thickness and slopes) derived directly from the bed and\nsurface DEMs produced by Copland and Sharp [2001] and\nkept constant for all the experiments presented. The model\nsolves the coupled thermal and mechanical components in\nconsort by integrating vertically from the bed to the surface\nusing a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme to satisfy the\nsurface boundary condition of negligible shear stress,\nand the unknown basal shear traction is modified using\na fixed-point iteration scheme [Hubbard et al., 1998].\nThe computed steady state thermal and velocity fields\ngenerated are then compared with the field measurements\nmade at JEG.\n2.4. Control Experiments\n[15] Before proceeding with the main series of modeling\nexperiments, two control runs were conducted in which\nbasal motion was precluded (i.e., basal motion was pre-\nscribed as zero), and only thermal conditions were allowed\nto alter. The aim was to discern whether the model could\nsimulate observed surface motion at any time without\nrecourse to basal motion. As an initial control (JEG01),\nthe model was applied in temperate isothermal mode,\nequivalent to raising all ice to the pressure-melting point\n(PMP) by specifying a constant rate factor for temperate ice\n(A = 2.148 \b 10\u000116 kPa\u00013 a\u00011 [Paterson, 1994, p. 97])\nacross the entire domain. The objective of JEG01 was to\ndetermine the highest velocities that could be accounted for\nby internal deformation alone, taking the extreme (and\nunrealistic) end-member that JEG is temperate and isother-\nmal. In other words, it tests the degree to which warming\nthe ice, rather than introducing basal motion, would be\nreflected in surface ice flow.\n[16] The steady state surface velocity field produced by\nexperiment JEG01 is shown in Figure 3a. Significantly,\nmodeled surface velocities through much of the ablation\nzone remain close to or below those observed at any time of\nyear (Figure 3b), even during winter, when the slowest\nsurface motion is recorded (Figure 3c). Thus, even by\nraising all ice to pressure-melting point we cannot account\nfor the observed magnitudes of ice motion through the\nablation zone by appealing to internal deformation alone,\nhence another mechanism must be responsible. By apparent\ncontrast, across much of the accumulation zone the temper-\nate and isothermal experiment massively overestimates ice\nflow (Figures 3a and 3c). This is not especially meaningful,\nhowever, because we know that in reality ice throughout the\naccumulation zone is almost entirely cold, and therefore will\nexperience much lower rates of deformation than are\nimplied by this isothermal run. It does demonstrate, how-\never, that internal deformation is highly sensitive to the\nthermal evolution, and so it is necessary to investigate more\nrealistic thermal boundary conditions.\n[17] We therefore ran a second control experiment,\nJEG02, with zero basal motion but a fully evolved steady\nstate polythermal regime. We prescribed surface temper-\nF02006 BINGHAM ET AL.: HIGH ARCTIC GLACIER SEASONAL DYNAMICS\n5 of 13\nF02006\natures across the glacier ranging between \u000112\u0001C and\n\u000110\u0001C on the basis of the 15-m thermistor measurements\nmade during the field observations (Figure 1c), and set a\nvalue of 60 mW m\u00012 for the geothermal heat flux after\ndirect measurements made at the similar geophysical setting\nof Barnes Ice Cap, Baffin Island [Classen, 1977].\n[18] The steady state surface velocity field (contoured)\nand basal temperature field (graduated shading) derived by\nJEG02 are shown in Figure 3b. JEG02 demonstrates two\nthings. First, in terms of the glacier\u2019s dynamics, it reveals\nthat with no basal motion, surface velocities are under-\nestimated across all parts of the glacier regardless of the\ntime of year. Modeled surface velocities across the LABZ\nare 2\u20134 times lower than observed over winter and an order\nof magnitude lower than those observed over summer\n(Figure 3c); and modeled surface velocities across the\nFigure 3.

The left plots show basal\ntemperature (color scale) and surface velocity (contours) at steady state, and the right plots show surface\nvelocity field relative to the annual (color scale) with absolute velocities superimposed. (c) Velocity\nprofiles along the long profile shown in Figure 2a for experiments JEG01 and JEG02, compared with\nobserved values in winter, spring, and summer.\nF02006 BINGHAM ET AL.: HIGH ARCTIC GLACIER SEASONAL DYNAMICS\n6 of 13\nF02006\naccumulation zone similarly underestimate observed speeds\n(Figures 3b and 3c). JEG02, in combination with JEG01,\ntherefore strongly suggests that significant basal motion\nmust be occurring across zones of this predominantly cold\nglacier. Second, in terms of the glacier\u2019s thermal conditions,\nJEG02 evolves a steady state basal temperature field\n(Figure 3b) that reasonably approximates that measured\nby RES (cf. Figure 1c), with colder basal ice in the\naccumulation zone than in the ablation zone (Figure 3c).\nHowever, nowhere in the ablation zone do basal temper-\natures in JEG02 attain PMP. This may be because the\ngeothermal heat flux we specify (60 mW m\u00012) is too low,\nalthough the region\u2019s geology and longstanding tectonic\nstability provide no evidence that geothermal heating in this\nregion should be significantly higher. Furthermore, sensi-\ntivity experiments indicate that even with geothermal heat\nflux increased by a factor of 50% to 90 mW m\u00012, nowhere\ndoes the bed of JEG attain PMP under equilibrium con-\nditions with basal motion precluded. A more tangible\nexplanation could be that the heat deficit results from the\nmodel not accounting for sensible heat transferred by water\nfrom the surface to the bed, and the frictional heating that\nresults from englacial and subglacial water flow. Such\nfrictional heating is probably an important heat source\nthroughout at least the LABZ, where RES indicates warm\nbasal ice and supraglacial hydraulic forcing is known to\noccur [Bingham et al., 2005]. We therefore believe that the\nthermal conditions used to force JEG02 represent a good\nthermal model within the limits of this study.\n[19] Thus we used the control runs described above to\ndetermine reasonable thermal conditions for the model, and\nto confirm that basal motion is required beneath all or part\nof JEG to replicate the observed surface motion fields\nthrough all parts of the year. The main series of modeling\nruns we describe below was therefore designed to determine\nthe degree to which basal motion is required to replicate the\nobserved surface motion fields at different times of the year,\nand to assess to what degree the required forcing can be\nlocalized around supraglacial inputs or may be transmitted\nto adjacent regions of the glacier through stress gradient\ncoupling.\n2.5. Modeling Experiments\n[20] In the following series of experiments, we used the\nsame thermal inputs as those used for JEG02, but varied\nthe magnitude of basal forcing and the areas over which\nit is active for different times of year. We estimated the\nmagnitude of basal forcing over given periods on the\nbasis of the differences between observed surface motion\nfields (Figures 2b\u20132d) and the modeled surface motion\nfield resulting from no basal motion (JEG02; Figure 3b).\nThis makes the implicit assumption that any measured\nsurface motion over any given period that exceeds that\nproduced by JEG02 at steady state is a direct surface\nexpression of enhanced basal motion. We thereby derived\n\u2018\u2018residual\u2019\u2019 winter, spring and summer basal motion fields\nby subtracting the JEG02 surface motion field (Figure 3b)\nfrom the winter, spring and summer surface motion fields\n(Figures 2b\u20132d), respectively.\n[21] We performed five numerical experiments, as follows.\n[22] JEG03 was forced with residual winter motion\n(Figure 4a), i.e., the residual of Figures 3b and 2b. The\nrationale was to investigate the degree to which surface\nvelocities observed across the glacier over winter may result\nfrom a basal component of motion.\n[23] JEG04 was forced with residual summer motion\n(Figure 4b), i.e., the residual of Figures 3b and 2d. The\nrationale for this experiment was to investigate whether the\nfaster velocities observed over the glacier during summer\nmay adequately be explained by increasing the basal com-\nponent relative to winter, such as might result from supra-\nglacial hydraulic forcing.\n[24] JEG03 and JEG04 assume basal motion is ubiqui-\ntous. However, given the highly localized nature of the\nsupraglacial-subglacial connections we have observed, and\nthe relatively short periods over which they are active (1\u2013\n2 months per year), it may be more reasonable to suppose\nthat when supraglacial hydraulic forcing is taking place (i.e.,\nduring spring and summer), the resultant basal forcing is\nconcentrated around and downstream from supraglacial\ninput locations. Therefore in experiments JEG05, JEG06,\nand JEG07 we test the effects of prescribing only partial\nbasal motion fields across selected zones of JEG during\nspring and summer.\n[25] JEG05 was forced with residual spring basal motion\nonly across the LABZ (Figure 5a). The rationale for this\nexperiment was to investigate (1) the effect of a localized\nincrease in basal forcing beneath the LABZ, over a period\nwhen we know localized supraglacial hydraulic forcing is\ntaking place because of meltwater inputs into moulins h1\u2013\nh5 (Figure 1a), and (2) the degree to which this localized\nexcess ice flow can be transmitted up glacier through\nlongitudinal coupling alone. We consider the spring period\nfor this test because this is when peak velocities are\nobserved across the LABZ, so we would expect up-glacier\nstress gradient coupling to be at its strongest.\n[26] JEG06 was similar to JEG05, but with the active\nbasal motion field extended up glacier to the head of the\nUABZ (Figure 5b). This represents the known up-glacier\nlimit of warm basal ice [Copland and Sharp, 2001]; hence\nthe up-glacier limit of any expected basal motion, although\nno supraglacial inputs have been observed up glacier of the\nLABZ during spring. Here again we test the efficacy of\nlongitudinal coupling, by testing whether expanding the\nlimit of basal motion up glacier has any positive effect on\nice motion through the cold accumulation zone.\n[27] JEG07 was forced with residual summer basal mo-\ntion only across the UABZ (Figure 5c). This reflects our\nexpectation that later in the melt season the region of\nhighest basal forcing may migrate up glacier from the\nLABZ to the UABZ because of (1) the onset of drainage\ninto the accumulation zone moulins (h6 and h7, Figure 1a),\ndelivering surface runoff that might first encounter warm\nbasal ice at the head of the UABZ, and (2) the increased\nefficiency of subglacial drainage through the LABZ evident\nby July [after Bingham et al., 2005], which would act to\ndampen basal forcing down glacier of the UABZ.\n3. Results\n[28] Figure 4 shows the results from model experiments\nJEG03 and JEG04, respectively, forced with residual winter\n(Figure 4a) and residual summer (Figure 4b) basal motion\nfields. The attempt to reproduce the winter surface motion\nF02006 BINGHAM ET AL.: HIGH ARCTIC GLACIER SEASONAL DYNAMICS\n7 of 13\nF02006\nfield (JEG03; Figure 4a) replicates well the general dynamic\nbehavior observed at the surface, although along the glacier\ncenterline surface velocities are generally slightly under-\nestimated (Figure 4c). At steady state, warmer basal temper-\natures are found more generally in the LABZ than\nelsewhere (Figure 4a), although for the most part the base\nremains well below melting point and nowhere is the\nmodeled basal temperature field at melting point. The\nattempt to reproduce the summer surface motion field\n(JEG04; Figure 4b) also performs reasonably in terms of\nthe basic pattern, simulating the increase in velocities\nobserved across much of the surface with respect to winter.\nAlong the glacier centerline (Figure 4c) the model generally\nunderestimates the observed surface velocity by 15\u201330%\n(3\u20137 m a\u00011), except in the LABZ, where the observed\nsummer flow is overestimated by 60% (15 m a\u00011), and in the\nlowest 2 km, where it is underestimated by 15% (\u00033 m a\u00011).\nThe increased flow through most of the glacier warms more\nFigure 4.

Nevertheless, PMP is still not attained\nanywhere at the glacier base.\n[29] Figure 5 shows the results from experiments where\nonly partial basal forcing fields were prescribed. JEG05 and\nJEG06, forced with residual spring basal motion only in the\nLABZ (Figure 5a), and only down glacier of the nunatak\n(Figure 5b), respectively, both reproduce well the observed\ndynamic behavior in spring wherever basal motion is\nprescribed (Figure 5d). Notably, as soon as the boundary\ninto the zero basal motion field is crossed (i.e., up glacier of\nthe riegel in JEG05 and up glacier of the nunatak in JEG06)\neach model significantly underestimates observed flow.\nThis conclusion is also valid for JEG07 (Figure 5c), in\nwhich surface velocities are massively underestimated\nFigure 5. Results from experiments (a) JEG05, (b) JEG06, and (c) JEG07, in which basal forcing was\nprescribed only beneath selected areas of the glacier.

The most significant\nfinding from these three models is that wherever zero basal\nmotion is prescribed, the local surface velocity response fails\nto attain the observed magnitudes (Figure 5d); the implica-\ntion is that high velocities at the surface result from locally\nhigh rates of basal motion, rather than from stress gradient\ncoupling. This is highlighted by the failure of all three\nmodels to replicate observed velocities in the accumulation\nzone through stress gradient coupling alone. Once again, it is\nalso notable that although the modeled basal temperature\nfields reproduce the general pattern of observed variation in\nBRPr, nowhere does even the warmest modeled basal ice\nquite reach pressure-melting point (Figures 5a\u20135c).\n4. Discussion\n[30] Our model results support the contention, based on\nearlier field observations, that a substantial component of\nthe annual flow of JEG results from basal motion, despite\nthe prevalence of cold ice throughout much of the glacier. It\nis notable that regardless of the time of year, and even when\nthe temperature of all the ice is raised to PMP, significantly\nincreasing the internal deformation rate, a considerable\nbasal perturbation is required in the ablation zone for the\nobserved surface velocities to be modeled. These findings\nare entirely consistent with our field observations that basal\nice in the ablation zone is at PMP, permitting basal motion,\nand that during spring and summer basal motion beneath the\nablation zone is enhanced by supraglacial hydraulic forcing.\nWe have also learnt that even during winter a significant\nbasal motion component is required beneath the ablation\nzone, and that during spring and summer basal motion is\nlikely beneath the LACZ.\n[31] Critically, the modeling suggests that almost all\nexcess motion observed at the surface is a direct expression\nof local basal motion, and in particular the effect of stress\ngradient coupling on transmitting basal motion anomalies\nup glacier is muted. The evidence for minimal longitudinal\ncoupling is provided by those experiments (JEG05\u2013JEG07;\nFigure 5) where we restricted basal forcing to localized\nsectors of the bed. Enhancing basal motion only across the\nLABZ during spring (JEG05; Figure 5a), when the most\npronounced surface speedup is observed across the LABZ,\ncauses a negligible increase in surface flow up glacier, and\ndoes not induce an increase in surface motion in the\naccumulation zone. Expanding the basal motion field up\nglacier additionally to incorporate the UABZ (JEG06;\nFigure 5b) also has a negligible effect on ice flow in\nthe accumulation zone, and even raising basal motion\nbeneath the UABZ to the maximum summer levels\n(JEG07; Figure 5c) fails to increase flow up glacier of the\nablation zone. Our findings therefore do not support the\ncontention of Copland et al. [2003b], derived from two-\ndimensional (flow line) modeling, that JEG has a longitu-\ndinal coupling length of 4 times the local ice thickness. This\nhas three implications: first, significantly different conclu-\nsions can be drawn concerning the efficacy of longitudinal\ncoupling depending on whether modeling is conducted in\ntwo or three dimensions; second, we need to explain why\nstress gradient coupling is less effective than suggested by\nCopland et al. [2003b]; and third, the high motion observed\nin the accumulation zone likely results directly from basal\nmotion in the accumulation zone suggesting that at least part\nof the bed in this region is at PMP.\n[32] Earlier research at the temperate Haut Glacier\nd\u2019Arolla, Switzerland, has highlighted the possibility of\noverestimating the effectiveness of stress gradient coupling\nusing a flow line model rather than a three-dimensional\nmodel. Blatter et al. [1998] applied a flow line model to\nthe glacier which derived a longitudinal coupling length scale\nof 3\u20135 times the ice thickness; but the same formulation\nincorporated into a three-dimensional model [Nienow et al.,\n2005] suggested that up-glacier coupling actually occurred\nover distances of less than one ice thickness. The discrepancy\nmay arise for a number of reasons. In the Arolla work, it was\nsuggested that transverse stresses, not taken into account by\nsingle flow line models, significantly reduce the efficacy of\nlongitudinal stress gradient coupling, effectively producing a\nrapid longitudinal dissipation of supraglacially forced basal\nmotion anomalies [Nienow et al., 2005]. Lateral variations in\nbasal drag, such as might be imposed by \u2018\u2018sticky\u2019\u2019 patches of\nbasal ice away from a subglacial channel, or by friction\nagainst valley walls, are also neglected in the two dimen-\nsional case. At JEG, patches of cold basal ice may addition-\nally act as significant sticky spots. JEG also flows over, and\/\nor around, at least two significant topographic pinning\npoints, the riegel between the LABZ and the UABZ, and\nthe nunatak between the UABZ and the LACZ, and these\nmight also suppress longitudinal stress gradient coupling.\n[33] Our conclusion that stress gradient coupling is inef-\nfective at transmitting down-glacier basal motion anomalies\nFigure 5. (continued)\nF02006 BINGHAM ET AL.: HIGH ARCTIC GLACIER SEASONAL DYNAMICS\n10 of 13\nF02006\nup glacier of the nunatak suggests that basal motion must be\nresponsible for the significant speedup observed during\nsummer in the LACZ. This means that we must reconcile\nthe existence of basal motion there with RES data that\nsuggest the basal interface is cold (Figure 1c). The most\nlikely explanation is that at least some parts of the basal\ninterface in the LACZ are at PMP, and were not detected by\nRES. This raises two issues: first, howmay warm basal ice be\ngenerated beneath the LACZ despite modeled thermal con-\nditions to the contrary, and second, why was it not detected\nduring RES surveying? On the first point, some \u2018\u2018relict\u2019\u2019\nwarm basal ice may survive from a period of thicker glacial\ncover, when ice thickness in the LACZ was sufficient to raise\nbasal ice to pressure melting point and insulate it from the\ncold climate above. This same argument has been put forward\nto explain anomalous warm sectors of polythermal Laika\nGlacier, Canadian Arctic [Blatter and Hutter, 1991], and\nMcCall Glacier, Alaska [Pattyn et al., 2005]. Alternatively, or\nin addition, heat supplied by surface runoff accessing the\nsubglacial interface (e.g., through moulins h6 and h7) may\nmaintain parts of the basal interface at pressure melting point.\nOn the potential failure of the RES technique to identify\nwarm ice beneath the accumulation zone, the interpretation of\nhigh BRPr as a reliable indicator of cold ice may be\noverstated, or it is possible that the RES coverage simply\nmissed areas of warm ice.\n4.1. Future Model Development\n[34] As with any modeling exercise, our study has limi-\ntations that future efforts must address. First, while we have\nmodeled the effect of perturbing basal motion fields on\nsurface motion, we have not explicitly incorporated the\nmechanism responsible for perturbing the basal motion fields\nin the first place, i.e., the supraglacial hydraulic forcing\nmechanism. This requires an incorporation of fracture me-\nchanics into the ice flow component which was beyond the\nscope of this study, but which should be incorporated into an\nimproved holistic formulation of the system. Second, al-\nthough we have reproduced well the general pattern of basal\ntemperature variation over the glacier as determined from\nRES, our modeling has shown a general tendency to under-\nestimate basal temperatures such that PMP was not attained\nanywhere at the base. As discussed in relation to control\nexperiment JEG02, we attribute the discrepancy to the model\nnot incorporating heat supplied to the base by seasonal inputs\nof water, and frictional heating generated by this water as it\nmelts a passage beneath the glacier. Therefore future simu-\nlations might be improved with an explicit incorporation of a\nwater-derived heat expression. Finally, there may be a\nproblem in assuming that longitudinal coupling only affects\nthe deformational component of flow. It seems intuitive that it\nwill also affect the rate of basal sliding with the potential that\nlocal perturbations in basal traction could propagate velocity\nperturbations over greater distances than suggested by our\nmodeling. Unfortunately, there is currently no theoretical\nbasis for addressing this issue and it is a problem inherent to\nall higher-order ice flow models.\n4.2. Wider Implications for the Dynamic Response of\nHigh Arctic Land Ice to Climate Warming\n[35] The findings from this study have a number of wider\nimplications for predicting the likely response of High Arctic\nice masses, including the Greenland Ice Sheet, to projected\nclimate warming. The recent Fourth Assessment report of the\nIPCC [2007] has suggested that dynamic processes related to\nice flow could increase the vulnerability of the ice sheets to\nwarming, but effectively incorporating these processes into\nmodels remains one of the greatest challenges in predicting\nthe future contribution of ice sheets to sea level. The same\npoint is equally applicable to the smaller High Arctic glaciers\nand ice caps, which are also responding rapidly to climate\nwarming and are also contributing to rising sea levels. As we\nhave noted, seasonal speedups have been observed and\nattributed to supraglacial hydraulic forcing at a number of\nHigh Arctic glaciers [Bingham et al., 2003;Mu\u00a8ller and Iken,\n1973; Rippin et al., 2005], but it has been difficult to\napportion the surface response between localized basal\nmotion and stress gradient coupling with a nonlocal basal\nanomaly. Longitudinal stress gradient coupling has generally\nbeen considered more effective in colder ice [Copland et al.,\n2003b; Kamb and Echelmeyer, 1986], and this has been used\nto suggest that even small amounts of basal forcing in one\nlocation can drive a widespread speedup through a large\nproportion of an ice mass. This is a serious concern taken in\nthe context that summers across the High Arctic are becom-\ning longer and warmer, generating larger volumes of surface\nrunoff over longer periods, and increasing the number and\nduration of supraglacial-subglacial hydraulic connections.\nHowever, our study suggests that other factors, such as lateral\nvariations in basal drag, or the presence of topographic\npinning points, significantly reduce the efficacy of longitu-\ndinal coupling, at least in a valley-glacier setting, and limit\nthe dynamic response to localized areas of supraglacial\nhydraulic forcing.\n[36] Our study also underlines the importance of incorpo-\nrating basal motion into models predicting the response of\nHigh Arctic glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet to climate\nwarming. Clearly, at JEG, despite the vast majority of the ice\nbeing cold, a significant proportion of the ice flow results\ndirectly from basal motion. Only by including this basal\nmotion in our model can we simulate the current flow regime\nat the glacier, hence any study seeking to project the response\nof High Arctic glaciers to climate warming must incorporate\nat the very least a sliding \u2018\u2018law,\u2019\u2019 if not a more complex\nincorporation of subglacial processes, and should take into\naccount supraglacial hydraulic forcing. Seasonal speedups\nobserved on Greenland outlet glaciers [Joughin et al., 1996;\nMohr et al., 1998] also suggest they have a warm basal\ninterface, and therefore that basal motion is an important\ndynamic process at least at the fringes of the continental ice\nsheet. Recently it has come to light that many of Greenland\u2019s\noutlet glaciers are accelerating over annual\/decadal time-\nscales [Howat et al., 2005; Luckman et al., 2006; Rignot\nand Kanagaratnam, 2006; Stearns and Hamilton, 2007], and\nmany possible causes for this phenomenon have been pro-\nposed, including an increased influence of supraglacial\nhydraulic forcing [Zwally et al., 2002], or oceanic warming\n[Payne et al., 2005], leading to ice shelf removal and\/or ice\nfront retreat, reducing resistance to flow. Whatever the\ncatalyst(s) for these marked accelerations, it is certain that\nbeneath Greenland\u2019s outlet glaciers much basal ice is warm,\nthus basal motion forms a significant component of the\ndynamic response and must be incorporated into models\nF02006 BINGHAM ET AL.: HIGH ARCTIC GLACIER SEASONAL DYNAMICS\n11 of 13\nF02006\nseeking to project the response of all High Arctic land ice to\nclimatic warming.\n5. Conclusions\n[37] John Evans Glacier experiences significant seasonal\nincreases in surface velocity every melt season [Bingham et\nal., 2003]. This phenomenon has been linked to \u2018\u2018supra-\nglacial hydraulic forcing,\u2019\u2019 whereby surface meltwater drains\ninto a distributed subglacial drainage system, and induces\nenhanced basal motion across unspecified parts of the bed.\nWhat has remained unclear until now is the extent to which\nsuch a basal perturbation over one part of the bed may be\ntransmitted more widely through the glacier through the\neffect of stress gradient coupling. We have used a three-\ndimensional, thermally coupled flow model incorporating\nstress gradient coupling to investigate where, and by how\nmuch, the basal velocity field needs to be perturbed to\nreproduce the surface velocity fields at different times of\nthe year. Prescribing zero basal motion in the model but\nvarying thermal conditions, we were unable to simulate the\nsurface velocity field at any time of year in all parts of the\nglacier except the upper accumulation zone. Hence we infer\nthat basal motion takes place down glacier of all known\nsupraglacial-subglacial hydraulic connections during at least\npart of the year. By varying the magnitude and pattern of the\nbasal velocity perturbation, the model was better able to\nreplicate the observed surface velocity fields at different\ntimes of the year.\n[38] The modeling reported here implies that an earlier\nreported longitudinal coupling length scale of 4 times the ice\nthickness for this mostly cold glacier, based on a single flow\nline model [Copland et al., 2003b], is a significant overesti-\nmate. Rather, by varying the areas of active basal motion at\nthe bed, we have found that it is difficult to transmit basal\nmotion anomalies up glacier by more than one ice thickness,\nand in some sectors of the glacier the coupling length is\nseverely reduced through the effect of topographic pinning\npoints, especially around the nunatak marking the divide\nbetween the accumulation and ablation zones. This has two\nsignificant implications. First, it shows that radically different\nestimates of the efficacy of longitudinal stress gradient\ncoupling are obtained when modeling in three, as opposed\nto two, dimensions, and the former dramatically reduces the\nestimated longitudinal coupling length scale relative to the\nlatter. The reasons for this need to be further investigated, but\nthe implication is that although longitudinal coupling has\npreviously been stated to be more effective in colder ice\nmasses, its role in transmitting basal motion anomalies over\nlarge distances may have been overstated. Hence, second,\nmost surface velocity increases, such as those observed here,\nand at glaciers with comparable thermal regimes, probably\narise directly from local basal forcing, and do not reflect stress\ngradient coupling with nonlocal basal forcing. Recent studies\nhave highlighted the neglect of potentially critical dynamic\nprocesses in models seeking to predict the contribution of\nHigh Arctic glaciers and the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea level\nrise. Our experiments highlight the importance of incorpo-\nrating a basal motion component into future formulations.\n[39] Acknowledgments. This research was developed under the UK\nNERC-ARCICE program.
