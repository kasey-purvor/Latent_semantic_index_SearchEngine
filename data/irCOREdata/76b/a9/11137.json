A previous case study found a relationship be-\ntween high spectral width measured by the CUTLASS Fin-\nland HF radar and elevated electron temperatures observed\nby the EISCAT and ESR incoherent scatter radars in the post-\nmidnight sector of magnetic local time. This paper expands\nthat work by briefly re-examining that interval and looking\nin depth at two further case studies. In all three cases a re-\ngion of high HF spectral width (> 200 ms\u22121) exists poleward\nof a region of low HF spectral width (< 200 ms\u22121). Each\ncase, however, occurs under quite different geomagnetic con-\nditions. The original case study occurred during an interval\nwith no observed electrojet activity, the second study dur-\ning a transition from quiet to active conditions with a clear\nband of ion frictional heating indicating the location of the\nflow reversal boundary, and the third during an isolated sub-\nstorm. These case studies indicate that the relationship be-\ntween elevated electron temperature and high HF radar spec-\ntral width appears on closed field lines after 03:00 magnetic\nlocal time (MLT) on the nightside. It is not clear whether\nthe same relationship would hold on open field lines, since\nour analysis of this relationship is restricted in latitude. We\nfind two important properties of high spectral width data on\nthe nightside. Firstly the high spectral width values occur on\nboth open and closed field lines, and secondly that the power\nspectra which exhibit high widths are both single-peak and\nmultiple-peak. In general the regions of high spectral width\n(> 200 ms\u22121) have more multiple-peak spectra than the re-\ngions of low spectral widths whilst still maintaining a ma-\njority of single-peak spectra. We also find that the region\nof ion frictional heating is collocated with many multiple-\npeak HF spectra. Several mechanisms for the generation of\nhigh spectral width have been proposed which would pro-\nduce multiple-peak spectra, these are discussed in relation to\nthe data presented here. Since the regions of high spectral\nwidth are observed both on closed and open field lines the\nuse of the boundary between low and high spectral width as\nCorrespondence to: E. E.

Ionosphere (auroral ionosphere; ionospheric ir-\nregularities)\n1 Introduction\nThe Doppler spectral width parameter observed by coher-\nent HF radars is associated with the turbulent characteristics\nof the plasma irregularities being illuminated by the radar.\nIf one thinks of the spectral width (defined here as the full\nwidth at half maximum) in terms of the power spectrum it\ndescribes, then it is essentially a measure of how variable the\nDoppler line-of-sight velocity has been during the integra-\ntion period and within the spatial range of the radar obser-\nvation cell. However, the power spectra returned from the\nradar sometimes contain two or more separate and well de-\nfined peaks at different velocities. Under these circumstances\nthe standard spectral width parameter does not tell the whole\nstory and the spectra themselves require inspection. For\nsome time now, the spectral width parameter observed by the\nSuper Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) coherent\nHF radars (Greenwald et al., 1995), has been used as an iono-\nspheric proxy for the position of the low-altitude cusp on the\ndayside. It is thought that within the cusp region the spectral\nwidth is high (> 150 ms\u22121) and variable (Baker et al., 1990,\n1995; Pinnock et al., 1995, Andre\u00b4 et al., 1999, 2000a; Mi-\nlan et al., 1999; Moen et al., 2001; Rodger, 2000; Milan and\nLester, 2001; Pinnock and Rodger, 2001), although this is not\nalways the case (Rodger et al., 1995). This feature is believed\nto be the result of the problems that the standard parame-\nter fitting software (FITACF) (Villain et al., 1987) has fitting\nauto-correlation functions (ACFs) which lead to power spec-\ntra that have several large peaks. Hence the spectral width\nand line-of-sight velocity are both more variable where the\nspectra have multiple-peaks, and the errors associated with\nthe fitting of these parameters are increased (e.g. Andre\u00b4 et\n1400 E. E. Woodfield et al.: Nightside studies of coherent HF Radar spectral width behaviour\nal., 2000a). The low-latitude boundary layer (LLBL) has\nbeen associated with double-peak spectra from the Super-\nDARN radars (Schiffler et al., 1997; Huber and Sofko, 2000)\nand multiple-peak spectra (Baker et al., 1995). Regions of\nionospheric backscatter with similar spectral width features\nto those seen in the cusp are also found frequently on the\nnightside (Lewis et al., 1997; Dudeney et al., 1998; Lester et\nal., 2001; Woodfield et al., 2002).\nSeveral suggestions for mechanisms responsible for these\nmultiple-peak spectra have been made. Looking at the cusp\nspectra, Andre\u00b4 et al. (1999, 2000a), have simulated high\nspectral widths in the radar data by the use of a time-varying\nelectric field with a frequency in the Pc1\/Pc2 band (0.1 to\n5 Hz). The occurrence of such waves is observed to increase\nin a step-like manner when low-altitude satellites enter the\ncusp region (e.g. Maynard et al., 1991; Matsuoka et al.,\n1993). Work by Schiffler et al. (1997), and following on from\nthis, by Huber and Sofko (2000), on the double-peak spectra\nwhich these authors associated with the LLBL, has ruled out\n(i) oppositely moving plasma waves, (ii) a steady or step-\nlike change in the velocity within the radar range cell within\nthe integration time and (iii) factors relating to the propaga-\ntion of the radar beams (both vertical propagation and side\nlobe effects). Their preferred mechanism is the presence of\nsmall scale (< 26 km) and shortlived (< 4 s) vortices within\nthe radar field of view. They suggested these vortices could\nbe formed either by the presence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability or from the radial electric field produced around\na core of filamentary electron precipitation away from which\nions spread radially (Davidson, 1965). Simulations by Andre\u00b4\net al. (2000b) suggest that several plasma vortices within a\nrange cell could produce a multiple-peak spectrum.\nThus far, work on the mechanisms responsible for this fea-\nture of the spectral width has concentrated in and around the\ncusp area on the dayside. The mechanisms proposed for this\nfeature on the dayside could also be responsible for the high\nand variable spectral width observed on the nightside. Cer-\ntainly within the auroral oval there are likely to be filamen-\ntary field aligned currents that could generate vortical turbu-\nlence. Also the velocity shear at the flow reversal boundary\n(FRB) could be a source for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nthat in turn could generate small vortices in the ionospheric\nplasma. Satellites have also detected the presence of electric\nfield variations of the appropriate frequency in the region of\nthe auroral oval (Gurnett et al., 1984; Gurnett, 1991). There-\nfore, all mechanisms proposed for the cusp\/LLBL are also\npossible on the nightside.\nAnother feature frequently observed on the nightside is a\nsharp gradient between the areas of low (< 200 ms\u22121) and\nhigh (> 200 ms\u22121) spectral width (Lewis et al., 1997; Du-\ndeney et al., 1998; Lester et al., 2001; Woodfield et al., 2002)\nwhich, in general, is not associated with a gradient in the\nbackscatter power, unlike cusp data (Milan and Lester, 2001).\nThis well-defined nightside gradient in spectral width has\nbeen given two different interpretations. Lester et al. (2001)\nsuggested that the gradient is the radar representation of the\nopen\/closed field line boundary (OCFLB), at least for part of\nthe interval discussed. Alternatively the gradient could be re-\nlated to the central plasma sheet (CPS)\/plasma sheet bound-\nary layer (PSBL) boundary (Lewis et al., 1997; Dudeney et\nal., 1998). In the first interpretation all high spectral width\nwould occur on open field lines. In the second, the high spec-\ntral width would be on both open and closed field lines. Since\nthe spectral width boundary is frequently observable by the\nSuperDARN radars it would make a good ionospheric proxy\nfor a magnetospheric boundary. However, the veracity of the\nproposals must first be investigated thoroughly and this paper\naims to further test them.\nThe presence of the EISCAT (European Incoherent SCAT-\nter) and ESR (EISCAT Svalbard Radar) radars within the\nfield-of-view of the CUTLASS radars (Co-operative UK\nTwin Located Auroral Sounding System) provides an ideal\nopportunity for more detailed observations of the plasma\nconditions where large spectral widths are found. The inher-\nent differences in the techniques of incoherent and coherent\nscatter supply more information on which to base conclu-\nsions. The CUTLASS radars cover a large area with data\nbeing taken continuously providing the basic parameters of\nreturned power, line of sight velocity and spectral width. The\nEISCAT and ESR radars have a more restricted viewing area\nand operate for only part of the time, but provide more details\nabout the temperature and structure of the plasma as well as\nthe ion velocity and other parameters. Thus the two datasets\ncompliment each other very well. Elevated electron tem-\nperature can be an indicator of precipitation (e.g. Kofman\nand Wickwar, 1984) and could therefore be linked to small\nplasma vortices. Similarly, ion frictional heating signatures\nare an indication of changing conditions in the plasma, where\nthe difference in the relative velocities of the ions and neu-\ntrals is significant (e.g. Rees and Walker, 1968; St-Maurice\nand Hanson, 1982; Davies et al., 1999). Such a region of\ndiffering velocities could lead to the Kelvin Helmholtz in-\nstability and general turbulence, which would in turn affect\nthe spectral width observed by coherent radars. Woodfield\net al. (2002) found in one case that high spectral width (as\nseen by the HF radar) was associated with elevated electron\ntemperature (as measured by incoherent scatter radars), but\nthat high electron temperature was not necessarily associated\nwith wide HF spectra. The analysis conducted in this case\ndemonstrated that high spectral width can occur on closed\nas well as open field lines, thus casting doubt on the pro-\nposal that the spectral width gradient is an identifier for the\nOCFLB. This paper extends the work by Woodfield et al.\n(2002), briefly revisiting the first case study, and then intro-\nducing two further case studies and looking in more detail at\nthe power spectra from the received backscatter.\n2 Experimental overview\nThree case studies are presented in this paper all of which\nmake use of both coherent HF radar data from the Finland\nradar of the CUTLASS, and low elevation incoherent radar\ndata from the EISCAT mainland VHF system.

The two CUT-\nLASS radars are located at Pykkvib\u00e6r, Iceland (64.5\u25e6 N,\n68.5\u25e6 E geomagnetic coordinates), (Altitude Adjusted Cor-\nrected Geomagnetic (AACGM) co-ordinates based on the\nwork of Baker and Wing (1989) will be employed throughout\nthis paper) and at Hankasalmi, Finland (58.6\u25e6 N, 104.9\u25e6 E).\nOnly Hankasalmi data will be presented in this paper, and the\nlocations of the field-of-view and beams 7 and 9 are shown\nin Fig. 1. In common mode both CUTLASS radars scan\nthrough 16 azimuthal beams (numbered 0 to 15) arranged\nsymmetrically about the radar bore site with a beam width of\n\u223c3.25\u25e6. Each beam is separated into 75 range gates (num-\nbered 0 to 74, 0 closest to the radar). In standard common\nmode these range gates are 45 km in length with a distance\nto the first gate of 180 km. The radars can operate at fre-\nquencies between 8 and 20 MHz. The operating modes used\nin the three case studies were different in terms of time res-\nolution on the beams in each case, the spatial extent of the\nrange gates was as described above. On 20 December 1998\nfrom 01:00 UT to 05:00 UT, the dwell time was 7 s on each\nbeam, while the beams were not scanned successively as in\nthe common mode, but in the order 15, 5, 14, 5, 13, 5, 12\netc. This gives a time resolution of 14 s on beam 5 and\n224 s for a full scan. Then at 05:00 UT the scan order re-\nturned to consecutive beams and the temporal resolution for\nbeam 9 from 05:00 UT to 06:00 UT was therefore reduced\nfrom 224 s to 120 s. On 22\u201323 November 1999, the radar\nwas running common mode, which has a dwell time of 7 s on\neach beam and the scans are synchronised to start at beam 15\n(for Finland) every two minutes. On 21\u201322 August 1998,\nbeam 9 was run in high time resolution mode to coincide\nwith the ESR beam. The dwell time was 2 s with the beams\nscanned in the following order: 15, 9, 14, 9, 13, 9, 12, etc,\nthus the temporal resolution of beam 9 was 4 s and for the\nwhole scan 64 s.\nAll three of the case studies presented herein utilise the\nEISCAT mainland VHF radar (Rishbeth and Williams, 1985)\nin CP4 mode. This consists of two low-elevation beams from\nthe VHF radar (which operates at a frequency of 224 MHz).\nBeam one has an azimuth to geographic north of 345\u25e6 and\nbeam two has an azimuth of 359\u25e6. The elevation of both\nbeams is 30\u25e6. Only long pulse data has been included in\nthese studies, which for the elevation of the beam used covers\naltitudes from approximately 280 km to 1050 km in 20 gates.\nThe ESR (Wannberg et al., 1997), which was running for 2 of\nthe events studied, was directed at an azimuth of 161.6\u25e6 with\nan elevation of 30\u25e6 on 20 December 1998 and 31\u25e6 on 21 to\n22 August 1998. The long pulse code from the ESR for this\nscan covers altitudes from approximately 90 km to 470 km in\n27 gates.\n3 Results\n3.1 20 December 1998\nThis case study has been looked at previously by Woodfield\net al. (2002) and consists of a clear example of a steep gradi-\nent between low (<200 ms\u22121) and high (>200 ms\u22121) spec-\ntral width in the post-midnight sector. This interval is briefly\nrevisited here. The IMF and solar wind parameters are pre-\nsented in detail in Woodfield et al. (2002), but a brief descrip-\ntion follows here. The IMF conditions were variable during\nthis interval, with periods of southward Bz (in GSM coordi-\nnates). The IMF By component also underwent many rever-\nsals between positive and negative. The solar wind speed\ngradually increased from \u223c350 kms\u22121 at 00:10 UT (a de-\nlay time of 10 min was estimated and has been added to the\ntimes given here) to \u223c420 kms\u22121 at 03:40 UT where it re-\nmained until decreasing to 400 kms\u22121 at 05:30 UT. The solar\nwind density varied around 11 cm\u22123 for the most part, ex-\ncept for two sudden excursions to 7 cm\u22123 between 01:30 UT\nand 02:30 UT and then 05:30 UT to the end of the interval at\n06:00 UT.\nObservations of electron density, electron temperature, ion\ntemperature and line-of-sight ion velocity from the ESR are\npresented in Fig. 2, panels (a) to (d), respectively. The spec-\ntral width and line-of-sight velocity data from the Finland\nCUTLASS radar are shown in panels (e) and (f) (the latitude\nrange has been restricted to correspond to the ESR data in\nthe other four panels). Negative (positive) velocities repre-\nsent flow directed away from (towards) the Finland radar for\nboth the CUTLASS and ESR data.

There were\ntwo regions of high and variable spectral width in the CUT-\nLASS Finland data within this latitude and time range. The\nfirst started at 01:30 UT and moved poleward out of the lati-\ntude range shown at 02:30 UT. The second started where the\nequatorward edge of the high spectral width moved back to\nbelow 74\u25e6 N at 03:00 UT and finished with the equatorward\nedge moving poleward beyond 74\u25e6 N at 04:45 UT. These re-\ngions of high width roughly coincide with regions of elevated\nand structured electron temperature, more noticeably in the\nsecond interval.\nAn analysis of the data between 71\u25e6 N and 72\u25e6 N has been\nconducted to determine the relationship between spatially\nand temporally coincident measurements of electron and ion\ntemperature from the EISCAT and ESR radars and the spec-\ntral width measurements from CUTLASS Finland. This band\nof latitude has been chosen as the altitude of the EISCAT\nand ESR measurements are close to 300 km. The CUTLASS\nFinland observations in this region were also expected to be\nfrom around this height in the F-region. An investigation of\nthe elevation angle data confirms that the scatter originates\nin the F-region. Coincident data from the EISCAT radars\nand the CUTLASS Finland radar during the interval 01:00 to\n06:00 UT are plotted in Fig. 3 as a scatter plot for data bins\nE. E.

(2002). Combined with magnetometer measurements\nof the FLR from the IMAGE chain (Viljanen and Hakkinen,\n1997) the OCFLB was given a lower limit of 72.9\u25e6 N for the\ntime span 02:00 UT to 06:00 UT in Woodfield et al. (2002).\nThis conclusion was based on the fact that FLRs are only ob-\nserved on closed field lines. Thus we can reasonably assume\nthat the scatter plots in Fig. 3 are all derived from closed field\nline phenomena.\nFigure 5 presents an example of CUTLASS Finland broad\n(291.5 ms\u22121) single peak spectrum for range gate 34 of\nbeam 9 (approximately 73.7\u25e6 N) taken from the scan of\nbeam 9 at 02:02:35 UT (this fast Fourier transform (FFT) of\nthe ACF has been normalised). The fitted, normalised power\nspectrum for the FITACF parameters of velocity and width\nhas been overlaid for comparison, where an exponentially\ndecaying ACF has been assumed (Villain et al., 1987). The\npower fitted by FITACF, 35.3 dB, was high and well above\nnoise levels (>3 dB). The majority of the spectra with high\nspectral width had only one peak (the number of peaks be-\ning defined here as those peaks with power above half that\nof the maximum peak). In the high spectral width regions\nthe tendency was for either a cluster of spectra with many\npeaks to occur over several minutes and range gates or for\n1404 E. E.

There was a cluster of multiple-\npeak spectra at latitudes greater than 73\u25e6 N in the period\n02:00 UT to 02:30 UT. However, in the region 71\u25e6 N to 72\u25e6 N\n(roughly gates 29 to 31 for beam 9 of CUTLASS Finland)\nwhere the scatter analysis was conducted, there were virtu-\nally no instances of multiple-peak spectra.\n3.2 22 to 23 November 1999\nDuring the interval 20:00 UT on 22 November 1999 to\n06:00 UT on 23 November 1999 the WIND spacecraft was\nlocated at approximately (\u221213, \u221267, 15) RE in (x, y, z)\nGSM coordinates. Data from the WIND MFI and SWE in-\nstruments are described below (data not shown) (Lepping et\nal., 1995; Ogilivie et al., 1995). The time delay from obser-\nvation at the spacecraft until incidence on the magnetopause\nis estimated at 3 \u00b1 15 min. From 20:00 UT to 03:30 UT\nBz (GSM) varied between 0 and +6 nT. From 03:30 UT Bz\nmoved almost linearly from 0 nT to\u22128 nT at 06:00 UT when\nit turned sharply northwards again within a few minutes.\nThe By component was positive and relatively large (+4\nto +7 nT) from 20:00 UT until 02:00 UT, when it became\n\u223c0 nT for 30 min before rising steadily to+7 nT at 03:30 UT.\nIt remained at +7 nT until 04:30 UT when it decreased to\n\u22124 nT at 06:00 UT and then turned sharply in a few min-\nutes to +8 nT. The solar wind velocity was 450 \u00b120 ms\u22121\nthroughout the interval. The proton density was steady at\n\u223c6 cm\u22123 from 20:00 UT to 03:00 UT after which 3 bursts\nof enhanced density occurred, each approximately 1 h in\nduration and 12 cm\u22123 in magnitude. In summary, the so-\nlar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions\nwere relatively stable with Bz northwards from 20:00 UT un-\ntil \u223c03:30 UT when there was a steady change to Bz south-\nwards passing 0 nT at 04:00 UT.\nData from the x-component of the IMAGE network (not\nshown) indicated quiet conditions until \u223c00:45 UT when\nthere was a deflection in the magnetic signature at the Bear\nIsland station (BJN, 71.3\u25e6 N) of\u2212100 nT from the mean field\nvalue. This was the station where the largest deflection was\nseen, smaller deflections were seen poleward and equator-\nward, decreasing in magnitude the further in latitude away\nfrom BJN. The x-component at BJN returned to previous\nvalues at 02:30 UT when wave activity with an amplitude\nof \u223c25 nT and frequency of \u223c2 mHz ensued in the stations\nfrom BJN to Ny Alesund (NAL, 76.0\u25e6 N). Similar patterns\nwere seen in the stations south of BJN, but of smaller am-\nplitude \u223c10 nT. This wave activity continued around a con-\nstant and small, 0\u201325 nT, offset from the mean field, un-\ntil 05:20 UT when a sharp, short-lived (\u223c5 min) bay in the\nx-component occurred. The bay was negative from Han-\nkasalmi (HAN, \u223c58.5\u25e6 N) to S\u00f8r\u00f8ya (SOR, \u223c67.1\u25e6 N) and\npositive from BJN to NAL. Following this bay, all of the\nmeasured x-components steadily decreased. The magnitude\nof the change was largest at BJN where the deflection started\nat \u223c0 nT at 05:20 UT to \u223c100 nT at 06:00 UT and then in-\ncreased in the same manner from the minimum at 06:00 UT.\nDuring this decrease, the stations from SOR to Ouluja\u00a8rvi\n(OUJ, \u223c60.8\u25e6 N) observed a wave signature (\u223c30 nT ampli-\ntude from 05:20 UT to 05:30 UT, then with a smaller ampli-\ntude to 06:00 UT) with a frequency of \u223c4 mHz in all three\ncomponents. The amplitude of this wave was much reduced\nat all the stations north of SOR, similar to the wave signature\nobserved in the first case study. It seems likely that this was\nanother FLR, although not as clear an example as the previ-\nous case, making it harder to identify where the last closed\nfield line was. Fortunately, as will be described shortly, there\nwas another signature of the OCFLB available to us in the\nEISCAT data which we have used.\nFigure 6 presents data from this interval from beam two\nof the EISCAT VHF radar and beam 9 of CUTLASS Fin-\nland for the latitude range 70\u25e6 N to 78\u25e6. Panels (a) to (d) of\nFig. 6 present the electron density, electron temperature, ion\ntemperature and line-of-sight ion velocity from the EISCAT\nVHF beam 2, respectively (equivalent to altitudes of approxi-\nmately 280 to 510 km). From 20:00 UT to 23:00 UT the elec-\ntron density in the latitude range 70.5\u25e6 N to 74\u25e6 N was large\n(> 2.7 \u00d7 1011 m\u22123). At 23:00 UT the electron density de-\ncreased, although remaining structured, until 02:00 UT when\nit returned to levels prior to 23:00 UT. The electron temper-\nature observations (Fig. 6b) exhibited complex structuring\nfrom 23:00 UT until the end of the interval at all latitudes.\nThe electron temperature enhancements at 23:00 UT coin-\ncided with the first evidence of enhanced ion temperature\nwhich appeared to move equatorward (panel c). The sub-\nsequent electron temperature enhancements (after 02:00 UT)\nwere particularly large. From panel (c) we have identi-\nfied three intervals when strong and consistent ion frictional\nheating was observed. Ion frictional heating occurs when\nthe imposed electric field changes direction or magnitude.\nThis changes the ion flow vector Vi , but has little immediate\nE. E.

The ions then collide with the neutrals causing an ion\ntemperature enhancement that is proportional to the square\nof the vector difference, (Vi \u2212 Vn)2. Momentum transfer\nfrom ions to neutrals (ion drag) causes the neutral velocity\nVn to become more aligned (in both magnitude and direction)\nwith the new velocity and thus (Vi \u2212 Vn)2 and the ion heat-\ning is reduced (e.g. Rees and Walker, 1968; St-Maurice and\nHanson, 1982; Davies et al., 1999). The first of the ion fric-\ntional heating signatures was the equatorward moving feature\nthat moved from 76\u25e6 N at 23:00 UT to 70.5\u25e6 N at 23:30 UT.\nThis was a weak signature that was collocated with a veloc-\nity shear presented in panel (d). The second ion frictional\nheating signature started at 70.5\u25e6 N at 00:45 UT and moved\nsteadily poleward reaching 75\u25e6 N at 01:30 UT. The third ion\nfrictional heating signature moved equatorward from 76.0\u25e6 N\nat 04:15 UT to 70.5\u25e6 N at 06:00 UT. These last two features\nwere in the same region as shearing in the velocity as well\nas depletions in the F-region electron density. In general, the\nline-of-sight ion velocities were highly variable and struc-\ntured during this interval.\nPreviously Lockwood et al. (1988) have shown that such\nmoving bands of ion frictional heating associated with ve-\nlocity shear such as those identified above, follow the motion\n1406 E. E.

The width of the ion frictional heating region\nis controlled by the length of time for which the difference\nin velocity between the ions and neutrals is significant and\nhence (Vi \u2212 Vn)2 is large. If the electric field conditions re-\nmain stable then the width of the ion frictional heating band\nwill reflect the length of time it takes the neutrals to align\nwith the ions. When the polar cap is contracting (expand-\ning) the FRB is the poleward (equatorward) edge of the re-\ngion of hot ions (Lockwood and Fuller-Rowell, 1987a, b). In\nthis case study it seems reasonable to use these ion frictional\nheating signatures (particularly the last two) as ionospheric\nproxies for the FRB. The FRB can in turn be used as a rep-\nresentation of the OCFLB. The FRB will always be equa-\ntorward of or equal to the latitude of the OCFLB with two\npossibilities to cause separation of the two. Regions of high\nconductivity such as may well occur in the auroral region\nequatorward of the OCFLB tend to cause a deviation in the\nplasma flow such that it avoids the high conductivity region\nand thus moving the FRB equatorward also. The second pos-\nsibility is viscous interaction with a convection cell on closed\nfield lines, close to the OCFLB (e.g. Lockwood et al., 1988).\nFox et al. (1994) demonstrated how such viscous cells could\nactually often be driven by nightside reconnection, as sug-\ngested by Lockwood and Cowley (1992). Therefore, when\nthe polar cap is contracting the poleward edge of the region\nof hot ions shows is a reasonable proxy for the OCFLB, but\nwhen the polar cap is expanding the equatorward edge of the\nhot ions can be on closed field lines and so can be considered\nas the minimum latitude limit for the OCFLB\nFigure 6f presents the line-of-sight velocity from CUT-\nLASS Finland beam 9. The overall form of the CUTLASS\nvelocity data was similar to that from the VHF system in\nFig. 6d. The CUTLASS and VHF velocity data both show\nvery complex flows from 20:00 UT to 00:15 UT. An inves-\ntigation of the global plasma velocity pattern during this\ntime was performed using the spherical harmonic potential\nfitting of the \u201cpotential map\u201d technique (Ruohoniemi and\nBaker, 1998), utilising all the northern hemisphere Super-\nDARN radars. The flow patterns from 20:00 UT to 23:00 UT\nwere highly complex, although it appeared that the locations\nof the EISCAT and CUTLASS radar beams were essentially\nin the region of anti-sunward flow out of the polar cap and\nas such the location of the FRB could not be located unam-\nbiguously during this time. The CUTLASS data indicated\nthat the FRB was close to 70\u25e6 N shortly after 23:30 UT and\nremained there until the majority of the ionospheric scat-\nter disappeared at 00:15 UT. When the ionospheric scatter\nreturned at 00:30 UT the FRB identified from spatial plots\nof the CUTLASS line-of-sight velocities from both radars\nmoved poleward following the motion of the second ion fric-\ntional heating signature. The latitude range of particular in-\nterest is 71\u25e6 N to 72\u25e6 N as this is the latitude range in which\ndirect comparison between electron temperature and spectral\nwidth is made. The OCFLB was located poleward of 72\u25e6 N\nfrom 20:00 UT to \u223c23:15 UT (also reasonable since the pre-\nvailing IMF and solar wind conditions would indicate that the\npolar cap was reasonably small at this time), from 23:15 UT\nto \u223c01:15 UT the OCFLB was equatorward of 72\u25e6 N, then\nfor the remainder of the interval (01:15 to 06:00 UT) the\nOCFLB was located poleward of 72\u25e6 N. This interpretation\nagrees with that obtained from the ion frictional heating sig-\nnatures, namely that in the latitude range 71\u25e6 N to 72\u25e6 N the\nfield lines are closed from 20:00 UT to 23:15 UT, open from\n23:15 UT to 01:15 UT and closed again from 01:15 UT to\n06:00 UT.\nTo consider the HF spectral width data in Fig. 6e we\nhave split the dataset into two distinct subintervals, 20:00 to\n23:15 UT and 01:15 to 06:00 UT. The first of these subinter-\nvals contained a large region of high spectral width with an\nill-defined boundary. In the second, a very definite boundary\nbetween high and low spectral width existed and moved in\nlatitude with time. Thus we avoid the interval of open field\nlines from 23:15 UT to 01:15 UT. The HF spectral width in\nthe first subinterval (20:00 to 23:15 UT) did not appear to be\nrelated to any elevated electron temperatures. In the second\nsubinterval a well defined gradient in the spectral width was\nevident, with high values poleward of low values. The equa-\ntorward boundary of the region of high spectral width fol-\nlowed the motion of the velocity shear and previously iden-\ntified ion frictional heating features where they were present.\nIn between the last two ion frictional heating features (01:15\nto 06:00 UT) the high values of spectral width appear to be\nrelated more to the electron temperature enhancements, as in\nthe first case study.\nE.

Top row, EISCAT beam 1, bottom row, EISCAT beam 2.\nThe very different nature of the two subintervals of spec-\ntral width behaviour becomes apparent when comparing the\ntime series for collocated EISCAT and CUTLASS Finland\ndata. This has been done for both the VHF beams and is\npresented in Fig. 7a beam 1 (gate 1,\u223c71.4\u25e6 N corresponding\nto beam 7, gate 29 of CUTLASS Finland) and (b) beam 2\n(gate 1, \u223c71.3\u25e6 N corresponding to beam 8, gate 28 of CUT-\nLASS Finland). As in the first study, a height of 300 km is\nassumed since the elevation angle is indicative of F-region\nscatter. As before, the spectral width is in red, electron tem-\nperature is in black and ion temperature is in blue (dotted). At\n00:15 UT in both VHF beams there is a large spike in the ion\ntemperature corresponding to the poleward motion of the re-\ngion of ion frictional heating. As this passes through the lat-\nitude from which these cells are taken, the spectral width be-\nhaviour changes distinctly from being high to being generally\nlow. Then, a few minutes after 05:30 UT when the ion fric-\ntional heating returned equatorward, the spectral width ap-\npeared to be returning to its former wider behaviour just be-\nfore 06:00 UT. Within the interval of 01:15 UT to 06:00 UT,\nthe OCFLB is poleward of the cells from which the data in\nFig. 7 is taken, thus the observations were again made on\nclosed field lines. The scatter plots for electron temperature\nand HF spectral width generated in the same way as for the\nfirst case study are presented in Fig. 8. The ion temperature\ncomparison in the region 71\u25e6 N to 72\u25e6 N is similar to that\nin Fig. 3 (i.e. with no clear effect on spectral width) and is\ntherefore not shown here.

Data from 21 to 22 August 1998. Panels (a) to (d) are observations from the ESR radar, electron density, electron temperature,\nion temperature and ion line-of-sight velocity (negative values are towards the radar) respectively. Panel (e) shows CUTLASS Finland,\nbeam 9, spectral width data and panel (f) shows the beam 9 line-of-sight velocity (negative values are away from the radar) both at high time\nresolution.\nson. This figure demonstrates the variability in the number\nof peaks of the spectra seen in high spectral width regions\nand how large widths can come from both single and mul-\ntiple peak spectra. Panel (b) also demonstrates that when\nthe spectrum has more than one peak the FITACF veloc-\nity does not show the whole story. This is generally re-\nflected by an increase in the parameter which indicates the\nestimated error in the FITACF fitting (Andre\u00b4 et al., 2000a).\nIn particular the third ion frictional heating signature (from\n04:15 UT to 06:00 UT) has very large spectral widths, often\nover 1000 ms\u22121. The spectra from this last heating signa-\nture have typically more than one peak (again identifying the\nnumber of peaks in the spectrum as those with more than\nor equal to half the power or the main peak). This phe-\nnomenon has been well studied on the dayside in the cusp\n(e.g. Andre\u00b4 et al., 1999; 2000a). In the regions where there\nis no ion frictional heating essentially all the HF spectra are\nsingle peaks with only a few being multiple-peak. All the\nother high spectral widths from the entire interval are as in\nthe previous case study, mainly single-peak spectra with a\nfew double or triple peak spectra distributed widely. The\nvery high spectral widths at the end of the interval from\n\u223c04:30 UT could be related to the cusp since the strongly\npositive By component in the IMF would shift the cusp to\nE. E. Woodfield et al.: Nightside studies of coherent HF Radar spectral width behaviour 1409\nearlier MLT. There are several indicators that this could be\ncusp data even at this early MLT (04:30\u201306:00 UT corre-\nsponds to about 06:45\u201308:15 MLT): the presence of large and\nvariable spectral widths in the CUTLASS data (e.g. Baker\net al., 1995), the poleward moving forms in the velocity\ndata (this is clearer in the EISCAT ion velocity data) (e.g.\nThorolfsson et al., 2000; Lockwood et al., 2000), the increase\nin electron density following the depletion due to the passage\nof the ion frictional heating region (likely due to cusp precip-\nitation, Yeoman et al., 1997; Newell and Meng, 1992). Per-\nhaps most indicative is the oppositely directed motion of the\nFRB and the ions from \u223c04:30 UT. This behaviour is con-\nsistent with a non-adiaroic OCFLB implying that there is re-\nconnection occurring in this local time sector which opens\nfield lines and moves them into the polar cap. It is hard to\nseparate the spectra found in the presence of ion frictional\nheating and those located in the cusp in this final part of the\ndata, indeed some of the ion frictional heating may be due to\nlarge flows observed in the cusp. However, the more pole-\nward in the region of hot ions one looks, the more clustered\nthe multiple-peak spectra are and the more peaks they have.\nIt seems likely therefore, that the truly multiple-peak spec-\ntra are related to the cusp, and in the region of ion frictional\nheating the spectra are single, double and occasionally triple-\npeak.\n3.3 21 to 22 August 1998\nThe final case study presented here is taken from 21:00 UT\non 21 August 1998 to 01:00 UT on 22 August 1998. The\nionospheric flows in this interval have been studied previ-\nously as an example of isolated substorm plasma flow be-\nhaviour (Yeoman et al., 2000). The CUTLASS Finland radar\nwas running a high time resolution mode on beam 9 which is\nideal for comparison with the low elevation mode of the ESR\nthat was running during the SP-UK-CSUB EISCAT and ESR\ncampaign at that time. The mainland EISCAT VHF system\nwas running in split beam, CP4 type mode during the night\ntime runs undertaken.\nData from the ESR are presented in Fig. 10 along with\nthe high time resolution observations from beam 9 of CUT-\nLASS Finland. Panels (a) to (d) show electron density, elec-\ntron temperature, ion temperature and line-of-sight ion veloc-\nity from the ESR data, respectively. Panels (e) and (f) show\nthe spectral width and line-of-sight velocity from CUTLASS\nFinland beam 9. The onset of the substorm growth phase be-\ngins at \u223c21:15 UT, with expansion onset from 22:50 UT and\nfull recovery by \u223c23:40 UT (Yeoman et al., 2000). There\nare two equatorward moving auroral forms observed between\n21:20 and 22:20 UT in the electron and ion temperature data\n(panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 10). These features are typical\nof the growth phase of an isolated substorm (Persson et al.,\n1994). Then, after the expansion phase onset at 22:50 UT\nidentified by Pi2 pulsations in the IMAGE ground magne-\ntometer network (Yeoman et al., 2000), there is a poleward\nexpanding auroral form seen in the electron and ion temper-\nature, the substorm associated auroral bulge.

The\nion frictional heating could indicate (as in the second case\nstudy) the motion of the FRB as the substorm expansion\nphase destroys open flux in the polar cap.\nOnce the CUTLASS Finland ionospheric scatter becomes\npredominant over the ground scatter at \u223c21:40 UT the equa-\ntorward edge of the region of scatter moves equatorward\nin accordance with previous substorm growth phase studies\n(Lewis et al., 1997), although this is out of the latitude range\nof Fig. 10e and f. The line-of-sight velocities (where there\nis ionospheric scatter) are comparable to those seen by the\nESR and VHF radar as shown by Davies et al. (2000), the\nESR data is presented in Fig. 10d. Yeoman et al. (2000) as-\ncribed the first dropout of ionospheric data (at 23:00 UT) to\na reduced number of irregularities due to suppressed elec-\ntric fields. The second (at 23:10 UT) they assume to be due\nto the changing HF propagation conditions as the substorm\n1410 E. E. Woodfield et al.: Nightside studies of coherent HF Radar spectral width behaviour\nprogresses (Gauld et al., 2002). Then, as the substorm sub-\nsides, the ionospheric scatter returns and moves poleward.\nThe beam-swinging analysis performed by Yeoman et\nal. (2000) on the data from the two VHF beams indicates\nthe location of the FRB for the majority of the interval\nfrom 22:30 UT to 23:30 UT. The FRB moves equatorward\nof 72\u25e6 N at approximately 22:45 UT and then returns pole-\nward of 72\u25e6 N at about 23:05 UT, for the rest of the interval\nit would seem to be above 72\u25e6 N given the absence of mag-\nnetic activity before the substorm onset and the expanded au-\nroral bulge later on. Little backscatter is observed between\n71\u25e6 N and 72\u25e6 N during these 20 min, thus for the majority\nof the interval which is analysed and presented as a scatter\nplot of electron temperature and HF spectral widths as for\nthe other two cases (Fig. 11), the data are from regions of the\nionosphere threaded by closed field lines: Fig. 11a is for the\nEISCAT beam 1 data, Fig. 11b for the EISCAT beam 2 and\nFig. 11c for the ESR. F-region scatter is assumed from the\nrange of the data although the elevation angle data in this\ninterval is unclear. The form of the relationship between\nelectron temperature and spectral width does not resemble\nthat of case study at all. Firstly the overall electron tempera-\nture level is \u223c1000 K higher than previously. This could be\nattributed to the increase in solar radiation due to the time\nof year although the electron density is not increased. Sec-\nondly, there is no distinct absence of low spectral widths at\nhigh electron temperatures, as in the pre-midnight UT half\nof the second case study. If there is any dependence, it is\nthat spectral widths decrease slightly with increased electron\ntemperature.\nThe spectra observed in this final case study show many\nmultiple-peak examples, particularly in the region of high\nspectral width observed from \u223c23:45 UT in the main band\nof scatter from \u223c70\u25e6 N to \u223c75\u25e6. It is interesting in this case\nthat there are multiple-peak spectra in the presence of high\nspectral widths and elevated electron temperatures, but we do\nnot see the relationship between high widths and high tem-\nperatures as in the first study. It is possible that the smaller\nintegration time for the CUTLASS Finland data in this case\nis showing up more of the multiple-peak spectra that may\nnot be observable in the larger integration times of the other\ncases.\n4 Discussion\nThe three case studies presented in Sect. 3 cover a varied\nset of geophysical conditions all of which have high spec-\ntral width data from the CUTLASS Finland coherent HF\nradar. There is evidence that the turbulence creating these\nlarge widths is generated by more than one physical mech-\nanism, although it is possible to have a dominant mecha-\nnism. The evidence presented in the three case studies can be\nsummarised in three key points, (i) high widths (>200 ms\u22121)\noriginate from both single and multiple-peak spectra, (ii) the\nrelationship between electron temperature and high spectral\nwidth is not consistent in the different intervals, and (iii)\nhigh spectral width can occur on both open and closed field\nlines. That more than one generating mechanism probably\nexists is unsurprising in such a dynamically complex region\nas the ionosphere. The question following from this is can\nwe associate particular mechanisms with specific geophysi-\ncal conditions and\/or locations and perhaps specific forms of\nthe power spectra. This has been done on the dayside with\nmultiple-peak spectra associated with the cusp (Baker et al.,\n1995; Andre\u00b4 et al., 1999, 2000a) and for double-peak spec-\ntra associated with the LLBL (Schiffler et al., 1997; Huber\nand Sofko, 2000). The aim here is to apply similar proce-\ndures on the nightside. The physical mechanisms proposed\nfor the dayside, namely temporal electric field variations in\nthe Pc1\/Pc2 frequency band (Andre\u00b4 et al., 1999, 2000a) and\nsmall scale vortices in the plasma (Schiffler et al., 1997; Hu-\nber et al., 2000; Andre\u00b4 et al., 2000b) are equally applicable\nto the nightside.\nThe analysis of the 20 December 1998 case study indi-\ncates a relationship between electron temperature and spec-\ntral width, namely that high spectral width is associated with\nelevated electron temperatures, but not vice versa. This anal-\nysis took place at \u223c300 km, 71\u25e6 N to 72\u25e6 N and on closed\nfield lines in the post-midnight sector. The spectra that are\nobserved in the region of high spectral width are primarily\nsingle-peak spectra with a cluster of multiple-peak spectra\nbetween 02:00 to 02:30 UT and\u223c73\u25e6 N to\u223c83\u25e6 N. There are\nmore observations of multiple-peak spectra in the high spec-\ntral width region than in the low spectral width region. In\nthe region of detailed investigation between 71\u25e6 N and 72\u25e6 N\nthere are virtually no multiple-peak spectra. Elevated elec-\ntron temperature in incoherent scatter radar data is a good\nindicator that there is particle precipitation present (Kofman\nand Wickwar, 1984) and this is often also related to field\naligned currents. Since high spectral widths are associated\nwith high electron temperatures in this interval in the region\n71\u25e6 N to 72\u25e6 N, it is reasonable to say that the large spec-\ntral widths could be related to precipitation. It should be\nnoted that this is not a straightforward conclusion, because\nthere are many low spectral widths at high electron temper-\natures, but there are no high spectral widths at low electron\ntemperatures. Thus, at this time, elevated electron tempera-\nture appears to be necessary, but not sufficient, to give high\nspectral widths. This perhaps shows us that several processes\nare in progress that have different effects on the ionospheric\nplasma. The lifetime and drift of the backscatter targets could\nhave an effect on the data that were observed, however the\nlifetimes of the irregularities are short, of the order of sec-\nonds and will not have a large effect. It would appear, from\nthe one-sided nature of the electron temperature to spectral\nwidth relationship, that not all high temperature electrons are\nrelated to large widths but high temperatures are required if\nthere are to be large widths. This could lead to the conclu-\nsion that different processes are involved, one which shows\nup as high electron temperature and is related to large spec-\ntral widths and one which just has a high electron tempera-\nture signature. At this time we can only speculate as to what\nthis difference maybe. If, for example, the high tempera-\nE. E. Woodfield et al.: Nightside studies of coherent HF Radar spectral width behaviour 1411\nture is indicative of precipitation, then there could be vor-\ntices caused by the mechanism suggested by Schiffler and\nSofko (2000). These would be discrete objects and may not\ncause large widths in every range cell analysed but would all\nbe within the region of high electron temperature. There is\nalso optical auroral activity in this region at this time veri-\nfying the presence of particle precipitation (Woodfield et al.,\n2002). Whether there is likely to be filamentary particle pre-\ncipitation, suitable for the generation of vortices of a scale\nsize less than that of the radar cell, remains unclear, but the\nfact that precipitation is present is supporting evidence that\nhigh spectral widths may be generated in this fashion. The\nfact that there are almost no multiple-peak spectra in the re-\ngion 71\u25e6 N to 72\u25e6 N however, does not support the vortex\nidea and also the region of optical activity extends equator-\nward of the high spectral width values. The comparison with\nion temperatures is unrevealing except to say that there is no\nobvious correlation between the spectral width and the ion\ntemperatures in this interval. As the second case shows, this\nis not always the case.\nThe second case study, 22 to 23 November 1999 is split\ninto two parts, the first (20:00 UT to 23:15 UT) has a poorly\ndefined boundary between high and low spectral width. The\nline of sight velocities in this interval are also highly vari-\nable indicating a highly turbulent plasma environment. The\nvast majority of the coherent power spectra in this part of the\ninterval have only one peak indicating that neither the tem-\nporal electric field, nor the vortex mechanism for generating\nhigh spectral width is likely to be present. It seems that the\nhigh spectral width is due simply to the variation of the line-\nof-sight velocity about a central value during the integration\ntime in a regime where the velocity is very variable. The\nanalysis of electron temperature and spectral width for this\npart of the interval indicates no clear relationship between\nthe two parameters. This is not to say that there is no precip-\nitation going on as the structure in the electron density and\nelectron temperature indicate that there most likely is precip-\nitation. The first subinterval of this case study is probably on\nclosed field lines given the geophysical conditions and the\npossible FRB motion equatorward at \u223c23:00 UT (shown in\nthe ion temperature) during this time. This conflicts with the\nfirst case study electron temperature comparison results since\nthat was also on closed field lines. The main difference be-\ntween these two intervals is the data location in MLT, in this\ncase the data are from the pre-midnight sector.\nThe second part of the interval (from 01:15 UT to\n06:00 UT) has a clear example of ion frictional heating at\na velocity shear indicating the location of the FRB. This in\nturn gives an approximate location for the OCFLB. The be-\nhaviour of the spectral width parameter changes dramatically\nas the FRB passes poleward of the region being analysed.\nOnce the analysis is on closed field lines again (01:15 UT to\n06:00 UT) the relationship of electron temperature to spec-\ntral width is similar to the first case study. The power spec-\ntra at the latitudes being analysed for this relationship again\nhave mainly single peaks. Therefore, as in the first interval,\nthere is no evidence for the presence of vortices in the region\nwhere we find the large spectral widths are related to high\nelectron temperatures. However, the power spectra in the re-\ngion of the second ion frictional heating event and FRB have\nmore than one peak (typically two peaks) and such a velocity\nshear could cause vortices by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabil-\nity. In the last hour and a half of the data it is difficult to\ntell which of the spectra are related to ion frictional heating\nand which are due to the cusp. The spectral width parameter\nfrom the FITACF software in this last section of the data is\nvery large as FITACF reaches the limits of its ability to fit to\nthese difficult spectra. It is likely that part of this is early cusp\nactivity due to the large, positive By at this time. Other indi-\ncations that these data are from the cusp are the presence of\npoleward moving forms (e.g. Thorolfsson et al., 2000; Lock-\nwood et al., 2000), the increase in electron density probably\ndue to soft precipitation such as is observed in the cusp re-\ngion (Yeoman et al., 1997; Newell and Meng, 1992), and\nthe rotational (as opposed to shear) nature of the FRB at this\ntime, indicating a non-adiaroic OCFLB at this time.\nThe third case study is an example of spectral width be-\nhaviour during an isolated substorm following a prolonged\nperiod of northwards IMF. The previous two case studies\nconsidered alone would lead one towards the conclusion that\nthe electron temperature to spectral width relationship found\nin the first case study happens on closed field lines. The\nthird case study does not give the same result, on this occa-\nsion there is no obvious relationship between the two param-\neters, despite the analysis being performed on closed field\nlines for the vast majority of the data. This may be related\nto the overall higher electron temperature, in general nearly\n1000 K larger than the other two studies. This could be due\nto the time of year in which this case study occurs. The so-\nlar illumination, and hence atmospheric ionisation, is high in\nAugust whereas in the other two studies, conducted in late\nNovember and December, the illumination is low. Although\none might expect the observed electron density to also be\nincreased in summer, this need not be the case since other\nprocesses may deplete the electron density. In particular, in\nthis case there is ion frictional heating also present and this\nis known to reduce the electron density. The spectra are also\nsomewhat different in this case, showing more multiple-peak\nexamples.\nThe first case study and the second part of the second\nstudy are the times during which there is a coincidence be-\ntween elevated electron temperature and the high HF spec-\ntral width. These intervals are both approximately located\nbetween 03:00 MLT and 08:00 MLT whereas the other inter-\nvals are in the range 22:00 MLT to 03:00 MLT. The discrimi-\nnating factor seems to be whether the data are from before or\nafter \u223c03:00 MLT on the nightside. The physical origin of\nthis difference is not clear.\n5 Summary\nThree intervals of data with combined measurements from\nthe CUTLASS Finland coherent HF radar and the EISCAT\n1412 E. E. Woodfield et al.: Nightside studies of coherent HF Radar spectral width behaviour\nand ESR radars have been investigated. A comparative ana-\nlysis of electron temperature data from the incoherent scat-\nter radars and spectral width data from the Finland coherent\nradar performed at an altitude of \u223c300 km, 71\u25e6 N to 72\u25e6 N\nfinds a relationship between the two parameters in two of the\ncase studies. The following key points have been identified:\n(1) The relationship between electron temperature from the\nincoherent radar data and spectral width from the coher-\nent radar data is not unique, nor is it universal. It appears\nto occur on closed field lines in the range 03:00 MLT to\n08:00 MLT (08:00 MLT is the limit of the observations\npresented here).\n(2) The power spectra from the coherent radar in the regions\nof high spectral width have both single and multiple-\npeaks. In general the single, wide peaks dominate.\n(3) The regions of high spectral width occur on both open\nand closed field lines.\n(4) The ion frictional heating in case study two is associated\nwith large spectral widths in coherent radar data with\nmore multiple-peaked spectra.\n(5) Several causes of high spectral width on the nightside\nseem to exist, therefore its use as an ionospheric proxy\nmust be approached with caution. The geophysical con-\nditions and magnetic local time locations where it could\nperhaps be used as a proxy must be investigated further.\nAcknowledgements.
