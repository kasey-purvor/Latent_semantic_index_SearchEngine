Different \ntypes of support demonstrate different effects for men and for women: managerial support has \na more beneficial impact on women\u2019s well-being, and organizational time demands have a \nmore detrimental impact on men\u2019s well-being. Recommendations for managers to boost \nemployee well-being include shifting the focus away from presenteeism and toward work \noutputs in order to reduce gender stereotypes and improve attitudes toward those using \nflexible work practices and family-friendly initiatives, incorporating work-home \nsupportiveness into the managerial performance appraisal process, and compensating or \notherwise recognizing employees taking on absent colleagues\u2019 workloads. \n \n \nKeywords: \nStrain; work-family culture; work-home interference; work-family conflict \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   4 \n \nOver the last twenty years, the intersection of paid work and home life has received an \nincreasing amount of attention in both the academic and popular press. The tendency towards \nlonger working hours for much of the labour force in the UK and North America (Brannen, \n2000; Duxbury and Higgins, 2001), along with escalating numbers of dual-income families \nand employed single parents (Office for National Statistics, 2007), creates increasing \nopportunities for multiple roles to clash with one another. The negative effects of such \ninterference between work and home have been well-documented, and include both \norganizational repercussions such as increased absenteeism and decreased job performance \n(Anderson, Coffey, and Byerly, 2002; Frone, Yardley, and Markel, 1997), and individual \noutcomes such as reduced life satisfaction and increased physical and psychological strain \n(Ford, Heinen, and Langkamer, 2007; Hammer, Saksvik, Nytr\u00f8, Torvatn, and Bayazit, 2004). \nThe degree to which an organization\u2019s culture exhibits support for its employees\u2019 efforts to \nbalance work and personal responsibilities can therefore be seen to be of paramount \nimportance.  \nWork-home culture is defined as the assumptions, beliefs and values among \norganizational members regarding the extent to which an organization supports and values the \nintegration of employees\u2019 work and personal lives (Thompson, Beauvais and Lyness, 1999). \nThis definition is consistent with existing conceptualizations of organizational culture as \nbeing rooted in values, beliefs, and assumptions held by organizational members (Denison, \n1996). Three distinct components of work-home culture can be identified in the literature: \norganizational time demands, or expectations that employees prioritize work over family or \npersonal responsibilities; negative career consequences associated with using \u2018family \nfriendly\u2019 practices or otherwise devoting time to family or personal responsibilities; and \nmanagerial support and sensitivity to employees\u2019 family or personal responsibilities. Work-\nhome culture is also conceptually similar to the construct of organizational support, in that it \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   5 \n \ncan be viewed as a type of support provided by the organization (Jahn, Thompson, and \nKopelman, 2003).  \nOrganizational cultures supportive of work-home issues have been shown to impact a \nnumber of work- and family-related outcomes (Kinnunen, Mauno, Guerts, and Dikkers, \n2005). Perceptions of work-home support have been linked to greater job satisfaction (Allen, \n2001), increased organizational commitment (Lyness, Thompson, Francesco and Judiesch, \n1999), and decreased turnover intentions (Thompson et al., 1999). Team members who \nperceive that management is supportive of family leave policies have been found to report \nlower levels of work stress and increased levels of family integrity (Kim, 2001), while work-\nhome support from immediate supervisors has been associated with satisfaction with home \nlife and increased family well-being (Clark, 2001).  \nAlthough organizational work-home culture has demonstrated effects on work-related \nstress and family well-being, its ability to influence individuals\u2019 overall health and well-being \nhas been under-researched. Aside from Burke (2001), who found that female managers \nperceiving organizational values more supportive of work-personal life balance reported \nfewer psychosomatic symptoms and more positive emotional well-being, and Thompson and \nProttas (2005), who showed that a supportive work-home culture was linked to lower levels \nof employee stress and depressive symptoms, little is known about the relationship between \nwork-home culture and employee well-being.  \nGiven the costs to organizations incurred by stress and health-related absenteeism, \nestimated at \u00a311 billion per year by the Department of Trade and Industry (2000), greater \nknowledge of how organizations contribute to employees\u2019 well-being would be useful in \nminimizing this phenomenon and its associated expenses. This study endeavours to extend \nprevious research by examining the impact of work-home culture on employee strain \nsymptomology. There are three possible routes by which a relationship between \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   6 \n \norganizational work-home culture and employee strain may take place. First, work-home \nculture may predict employee strain directly. Second, the effect of work-home culture on \nstrain may be mediated by work-home interference. Alternatively, work-home culture may \nmoderate the relationship between work-home interference and employee strain. This paper \nwill outline these three possibilities in order to generate hypotheses that can be tested \nempirically. A model depicting this combination of mediated and moderated relationships can \nbe found in Figure 1.  \nThis study will also investigate the presence of sex differences in the relationships \namong work-home culture, work-home interference, and employee strain. Previous research \nhas found significant sex differences in both antecedents to and outcomes of work-home \ninterference (e.g., Gignac, Kelloway, and Gottlieb, 1996; Higgins, Duxbury, and Johnson, \n2000). In order to investigate these differences more thoroughly, it has been recommended \nthat men and women be studied separately (Tenbrunsel, Brett, Maoz, Stroh, and Reilly, 1995; \nParker and Hall, 1992), but most research to date neglects to differentiate between the sexes. \nThere are, however, a handful of studies that have found some intriguing results with regard \nto sex differences in strain-based outcomes of work-home interference. Both Matsui, Ohsawa, \nand Onglatco (1995) and Nelson, Quick, Hitt, and Moesel (1990) found that work-home \ninterference resulted in increased psychological strain only for the women in their samples. \nBeatty (1996) found a link between work interference with home and depression only for \nwomen with children. However, Parasuraman, Greenhaus, and Granrose (1992) uncovered an \nassociation between work-home interference and life stress that existed only for men. In order \nto shed more light on these results, the present study will treat men and women as separate \nsample groups when examining mediated relationships, and also use sex as a moderator when \ninvestigating moderated relationships amongst work-home interference, work-home culture, \nand strain.  \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   7 \n \nDirect Relationship Between Work-Home Culture and Employee Strain \nResearch on organizational support provides both conceptual and empirical \nconfirmation of a direct link between employees\u2019 perceptions of a supportive culture and \nindividual strain. Organizational support theory posits that perceptions of organizational \nsupport meet employee needs for emotional support in the workplace (Rhoades and \nEisenberger, 2002). Perceived organizational support is thought to reduce psychological and \npsychosomatic strain by indicating to employees that material aid and emotional support are \navailable when needed to cope with high demands at work (George, Reed, Ballard, Colin, and \nFielding, 1993), and has been associated with reduced burnout and fewer somatic complaints \n(Cropanzano, Howes, Grandey, and Toth, 1997; Richardsen, Burke, and Mikkelsen, 1999). \nAlthough general support offered by organizations or by organizational members \ndiffers from targeted work-home organizational support, it is logical to expect that an \norganizational culture supportive of work-home issues can help to directly reduce strain \nexperienced by employees through the provision of helpful managers, sympathetic colleagues, \nand reasonable expectations concerning employees\u2019 work hours and priorities. This premise is \nsupported by existing research in the field. Employees who perceive that their supervisors and \nco-workers are unsupportive of work-home concerns have reported increased stress levels \n(Thompson and Prottas, 2005), whereas those who perceive that their team managers facilitate \nthe taking of family leave have reported reduced work stress (Kim, 2001). Thomas and \nGanster (1995) found that instrumental organizational work-home support in the form of \nflexible scheduling had a direct, negative relationship with employees\u2019 somatic complaints \n(e.g., headaches, insomnia, sweaty palms). Managerial women who perceive that their \nemploying organization\u2019s values are supportive of work-home balance have been found to \nreport lower levels of work stress, fewer psychosomatic symptoms, and more positive \nemotional well-being (Burke, 2001), and family-supportive supervisor behaviours have been \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   8 \n \nassociated with higher levels of job satisfaction and greater positive work-family affective \nspillover among employees (Hammer et al., 2009).  \nOn the basis of these findings, it seems reasonable to suppose that the extent to which \nan organizational culture is supportive of work-home issues may contribute directly to \nemployee strain. Employees who perceive organizational pressures to work long hours and to \nprioritise their jobs over their family or personal lives are likely to experience higher levels of \nstrain. Those who conform to organizational time demands may suffer from role overload, an \nestablished job stressor, while those who do not conform to such time demands may still \nexperience strain, as awareness of non-compliance with tacit organizational standards may \nfunction as a stressor. Perceptions that taking time off work to deal with personal or family \nconcerns may negatively affect one\u2019s career prospects and incur the resentment of one\u2019s co-\nworkers are also likely to act as a source of strain for employees. In contrast, managers who \nare supportive of work-home issues may help to ease strain by providing sympathy and \nunderstanding, by not penalizing an employee for his or her attempts to balance work and \nhome responsibilities, or by providing instrumental assistance with this balancing act (such as \npermission to work flexible hours or to miss early-morning meetings).  \nHypothesis 1a: There will be a direct, negative relationship between managerial \nsupport and levels of employee strain for men and women. \nHypothesis 1b: There will be a direct, positive relationship between organizational \ntime demands \/ negative career consequences and levels of employee strain for men \nand women. \nMediated Relationship Between Work-Home Culture and Employee Strain \nAnother way in which organizational work-home culture may affect employee strain \nis through the mediating variable of interference between work and home. Work-home \ninterference can be defined as a form of inter-role conflict in which the demands of the work \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   9 \n \nrole and the demands of the home role are mutually incompatible (Parasuraman and \nGreenhaus, 1997), such that meeting demands in one domain (e.g., home) makes it difficult to \nmeet demands in the other (e.g., work). Research has established the appropriateness of \ndifferentiating between work interference with home, in which work activities impede \nperformance of family or other non-work roles, and home interference with work, in which \nlife-role responsibilities hinder performance at work (Frone, Russell, and Cooper, 1992). \nThe effect of organizational work-home culture on employee strain may very well be \nmediated by interference between work and home. According to Frone et al.\u2019s (1997) \nconceptual model of the work-family interface, supportive attitudes and behaviours from \nmanagement and co-workers are likely to reduce the extent to which work interferes with \nhome life, and this reduced interference contributes in turn to lower levels of family-related \ndistress or dissatisfaction. The present study proposes to extend this theoretical support for a \nmediated relationship by arguing that supportive managers and co-workers may reduce \nemployee levels of home interference with work, as well as those of work interference with \nhome.  \nExisting research has identified other mediators in relationships among variables \nsimilar to the ones investigated in the present study. Thompson and Prottas (2005) found that \nperceived control mediated the relationship between work-home culture and employee stress \nlevels, and Sonnentag, Kuttler and Fritz (2010) demonstrated that psychological detachment \nmediated the link between low work-home boundaries and emotional exhaustion. This paper \nargues that work-home interference encompasses many of the mechanisms by which work-\nhome culture may impact strain, and is thus of primary interest when exploring a mediated \nrelationship. For instance, instrumental support from an employee\u2019s immediate supervisor \nmay lessen the employee\u2019s work interference with home, by providing increased flexibility or \ncontrol over the employee\u2019s work schedule and tasks. Attitudes of upper management that \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   10 \n \nconvey sympathy and understanding of work-life issues may also contribute to reduced work-\nhome interference, through the creation of an organizational climate in which line managers \nare encouraged to be considerate of employees\u2019 work-life concerns and helpful in resolving \nthem. For example, a manager who permits an employee to work from home, rather than \ntaking a day\u2019s annual leave when he or she has a child home sick from school, may reduce \nhome interference with work by reducing the time pressures inherent in falling behind on \none\u2019s work tasks. Preoccupation with work when at home is one way in which work \ninterference with home manifests (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985); this too may be reduced \nwhen the organizational work-home culture is supportive. These reductions in work-home \ninterference may then lead to decreased levels of employee strain.  \nEmployees who perceive that overt efforts to balance work and home responsibilities \nmay result in diminished prospects for career progression, and be met with resentment from \none\u2019s co-workers, may take less time away from work in order to avoid these negative \nsanctions. This may contribute to increased work interference with home. In addition, an \nemployee who attempts to balance work and home demands in such a way as to maintain his \nor her regular level of \u201cface time\u201d at the workplace may find that this domination of work \ntime and reduction of flexibility results in home responsibilities accumulating to a point \nwhere they produce higher levels of home interference with work. Organizational time \ndemands, meanwhile, can evoke pressures that dominate the time of the employee and \ninterfere with the fulfilment of responsibilities at home, creating work interference with home. \nSpending longer hours at work necessitates spending fewer hours at home, and might also \nresult in fewer opportunities to deal with home-related demands. These responsibilities are \nthen likely to build up and \u201cspill over\u201d into the work domain, creating home interference with \nwork. Increased levels of interference between work and home may, in turn, contribute to \nhigher levels of employee strain. \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   11 \n \nThere is empirical evidence to support the influence of organizational work-home \nculture upon levels of work-home interference among employees. The prospect of negative \ncareer consequences for those making overt attempts to balance work and home \nresponsibilities has been associated with increased work interference with home, as have \norganizational expectations for employees to work long hours, while supervisory work-home \nsupport has been related to lower levels of work interference with home (see Kinnunen et al., \n2005, for a review). On the other hand, employees perceiving a work climate that encourages \nthe sacrifice of family concerns in favour of work demands have reported higher levels of \nboth work interference with home and home interference with work (Kossek, Colquitt, and \nNoe, 2001).  \nAs a type of environmental stressor, work-home interference has been linked on many \noccasions to the outcome of employee strain. Both directions of interference have been \nconnected with increased levels of psychosomatic strain symptomology, which includes such \nsensations as anxiety, fatigue, and depression, and physical complaints such as headaches, \npalpitations, and insomnia (see Eby et al., 2005, for a review).  \nDespite these demonstrated links between work-home culture and work-home \ninterference, and between work-home interference and strain, few studies have investigated \ninterference between work and home as a mediator of the potential relationship between \nwork-home culture and employee well-being. Thomas and Ganster (1995) found an indirect \nrelationship between supervisor work-home support and employees\u2019 somatic complaints, \nmediated by general interference between work and home; the more supportive the \nsupervision, the less interference was experienced, which in turn was associated with fewer \nsomatic complaints such as headaches, insomnia, and sweaty palms. Similarly, Mauno, \nKinnunen and Pyykk\u00f6 (2005) found that work interference with home partially mediated the \nimpact of work-home culture on symptoms of distress among a portion of their sample, while \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   12 \n \nPeeters, Wattez, Demerouti and de Regt (2009) found that general interference between work \nand home mediated the link between an unsupportive work-home culture and employee \nburnout.  \nHypothesis 2: The relationship between organizational work-home culture and levels \nof employee strain will be mediated by work-home interference for men and women. \nModerated Relationship Between Work-Home Culture and Employee Strain \nA third way in which work-home culture may influence employee strain is by acting \nas a coping resource and moderating the relationship between work-home interference and \nstrain. Much of the psychological and organizational literature on coping methods has focused \non the potential for social support to buffer the impact of stressors on strain (e.g., Orpen, \n1992). Lazarus and Folkman\u2019s (1984) cognitive transactional model of stress posits that stress \nconsists of three processes: primary appraisal is the process of perceiving a threat to oneself, \nsecondary appraisal is the process of bringing to mind a potential response to the threat, and \ncoping is the process of executing that response. In the work-home context, individuals may \nchoose to seek support from the organization in order to eliminate the threat of work-home \ninterference perceived during primary appraisal.  \nEmpirical evidence for this moderated relationship have been mixed. Hypotheses \nconcerning the moderating effect of social support on the relationship between work-home \ninterference and strain were not supported by the findings of Frone et al. (1995) or \nParasuraman et al. (1992). However, research by Mauno, Kinnunen, and Ruokolainen (2006) \ndemonstrated that a supportive work-family climate buffered the negative effects of strain-\nbased work interference with home on physical symptoms such as headache, backache, and \npalpitations. O\u2019Driscoll et al. (2003) found that work-home related supervisor support \nmoderated the relationship between work interference with home and strain, such that work \ninterference with home led to more strain when support was low.  \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   13 \n \nPerceptions of a supportive organizational work-home culture may influence the \ndegree to which work-home interference results in higher levels of strain among employees. \nBoth work interference with home and home interference with work may have fewer \ndetrimental effects on employee strain when managers are perceived as being supportive of \nwork-home issues. The assistance, both practical and emotional, that managers can render \nmay lessen the degree to which intruding demands from one domain of life to the other affect \npersonal experience of strain. For example, if an employee arrives late at work one morning \ndue to a childcare emergency, a manager who is understanding and reassuring might reduce \nthe extent to which the employee worries about missed meetings and falling behind on work \ntasks. In this way, the strain experienced as a result of home interference with work would be \nreduced, although the interference itself remains constant. Similarly, if an employee must \ntravel on business and miss an important family gathering, sympathy from a manager and \npromises to ensure a similar conflict will not reoccur may reduce the strain arising from work \ninterference with home. The interference itself may remain unaltered, but its effects on strain \nwill be reduced. \nEmployees whose work and home responsibilities collide may also experience greater \nstrain if they perceive that taking time off work to attend to demands from home will \nnegatively impact their career and their relationships with co-workers. Employees perceiving \na more supportive environment may experience less strain as a result of work-home \ninterference, being safe in the knowledge that taking time away from work to manage \nresponsibilities at home will not damage their career prospects.   \nIn terms of organizational time demands, an employee whose work interferes with the \nfulfilment of responsibilities at home may experience additional strain if there are \norganizational pressures to work long hours and prioritise work above all other activities. \nThese pressures would increase the overall amount of work demands and reduce levels of \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   14 \n \nwell-being. When there is pressure to give precedence to work activities and to de-emphasize \ndemands from other areas of life, an employee whose responsibilities at home interfere with \nthe completion of work tasks might experience greater strain because he or she is not fitting in \nwith the organizational norm. As outlined above, all three components of work-home culture \nmay therefore influence the extent to which work-home interference affects employee strain. \nHypothesis 3a: The relationship between work-home interference and employee strain \nwill be moderated by managerial support for men and women, in such a way that the \nrelationship between interference and strain will be weaker in the presence of higher \nlevels of managerial support. \nHypothesis 3b: The relationship between work-home interference and employee strain \nwill be moderated by organizational time demands \/ negative career consequences for \nmen and women, in such a way that the relationship between interference and strain \nwill be stronger in the presence of higher levels of organizational time demands \/ \nnegative career consequences. \nSex Differences in the Relationship Between Work-Home Culture and Employee Strain \nAccording to gender role theory, social pressures encourage people to behave in ways \nconsistent with their prescribed gender roles (Eagly, 1987), prompting individuals to \ninternalize cultural expectations about their sex (Kidder, 2002). Given the gendered nature of \nthe work-home interface, with men\u2019s primary domain traditionally seen as work, and women \nheld primarily responsible for the home, it is reasonable to expect some sex differences in the \nrelationship between work-home culture and employee strain. Despite evidence that men\u2019s \nparticipation may be growing in some areas of domestic work (Hill, 2005), the great majority \nof household work and childcare is still performed by women (Nordenmark, 2004; Scott, \n2001). Employed women spend significantly more time in work and household activities \ncombined than do men (Duxbury, Higgins, and Lee, 1994), report higher levels of work-home \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   15 \n \ninterference (Kamenou, 2008), and are apt to report more psychological distress resulting \nfrom their combined roles of employment and marriage \/ parenthood (Nordenmark, 2002; \nVoydanoff and Donnelly, 1989). By internalizing these gender role expectations for greater \nparticipation in the home domain, employed women appear to be more susceptible to the \nnegative impact of work-home issues. They may, in turn, be more susceptible to the resources \nprovided by a supportive manager. There is a large body of empirical research demonstrating \nmen\u2019s ambivalence toward contravening the norm for masculine self-sufficiency by seeking \nor accepting help when experiencing problems (see Addis and Mahalik, 2003), and studies \nhave shown that social support may have a more protective effect against strain symptoms \nsuch as depression for women than for men (Kendler, Myers, and Prescott, 2005). For these \nreasons, managerial support may play a stronger role in predicting women\u2019s levels of strain, \nboth directly and indirectly via work-home interference. Managerial support may also be \nmore effective in alleviating the positive relationship between work-home interference and \nstrain for women, rather than men. \nIn an earlier volume of this journal, Broadbridge and Hearn (2008) identified various \nways in which the management of organizations is gendered. One of these was the valuing of \norganizations and paid work over work in the personal domain. Because men are subject to \ngender role expectations that they take on a \u201cbreadwinner\u201d role that involves paid \nemployment but little participation in family life, they have traditionally experienced work \ndemands as dominant over home demands (Cornelius and Skinner, 2008), and suffered \nstronger penalties than women for not complying with work role expectations and for their \nefforts to accommodate family responsibilities (Butler and Skattebo, 2000; Powell, 1997). \nStudies of organizations in the USA and Australia reveal widespread employee impressions \nthat using available work-home options would damage men\u2019s career prospects, more so than \nwomen\u2019s (Bittman, Hoffmann, and Thompson, 2004; Nord, Fox, Phoenix, and Viano, 2002). \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   16 \n \nThe presence of organizational time demands and negative career consequences for \nemployees who take leave to deal with personal responsibilities may therefore result in higher \nlevels of strain for men, both directly and indirectly via work-home interference. These two \nelements of work-home culture may also exacerbate the relationship between work-home \ninterference and strain for men more than for women.  \nHypothesis 4a: The relationship between managerial support and employee strain will \nbe stronger for women than for men. \nHypothesis 4b: The relationship between organizational time demands \/ negative \ncareer consequences and employee strain will be stronger for men than for women. \nHypothesis 5a: The relationship between managerial support and employee strain will \nbe mediated more strongly by work-home interference for women than for men. \nHypothesis 5b: The relationship between organizational time demands \/ negative \ncareer consequences and employee strain will be mediated more strongly by work-\nhome interference for men than for women. \nHypothesis 6a: The moderating effect of managerial support on the relationship \nbetween work-home interference and employee strain will be stronger for women than \nfor men. \nHypothesis 6b: The moderating effect of organizational time demands \/ negative \ncareer consequences on the relationship between work-home interference and \nemployee strain will be stronger for men than for women.  \nMethod \nSample \nParticipants in this study were drawn from a local government in the south of England. \nSurveys were mailed out to all regular (i.e., not seasonal or temporary contract) employees. \nTwo hundred and thirty-one surveys were returned, yielding a response rate of 29%. Seven \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   17 \n \nsurveys were excluded from the final analyses due to missing responses, generating an \neffective sample size of 224.  \nAs Casper et al. (2007) make clear in their review of work-home research methods, \nstudies of work-home interference disproportionately focus on parents of young children. \nGiven demographic trends toward single-person households, increasing eldercare \nresponsibilities, and involvement in community and volunteer activities (ONS, 2003, 2005), it \nis important that individuals with non-work commitments other than dependent children also \nbe represented in the research literature. The present study therefore includes in its sample all \nemployees of the target organization, not just those with dependent children.  \nThe majority of respondents were women (62.3%). Participant ages ranged from 17 to \n68, with an average age of just over 41 years. Sixty-nine men (82.1%) and 108 women \n(77.7%) reported living with a spouse or partner; of these, 58.3% of men and 71.2% of \nwomen were members of dual-earner households, where the spouse or partner was also \nemployed. Sixty-one men (72.6%) and 79 women (56.8%) reported having children; the \naverage age of the youngest child was 15.5 for men, and 13.6 for women. Ages ranged from \n9.6  months to 34 years. Thirteen men (15.5%) and 20 women (14.4%) reported having \ncaregiving responsibilities for adult dependents (other than children).  \nMeasures \nStrain symptomology was measured using Gottlieb, Kelloway, and Barham\u2019s (1998) \nten-item scale. Items assessed the extent to which respondents had experienced anxiety, \nfatigue, depression and overall strain during the past six months (e.g., \u201cHow often have you \nfelt that you carried your problems with you wherever you went?\u201d). Participants were asked \nto indicate the extent to which they had experienced each sensation in the past six months on \na seven-point scale ranging from \u201cnever\u201d = 1 to \u201calways\u201d = 7 for each item. Cronbach\u2019s alpha \nfor this scale was .95. \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   18 \n \nFor all items in each of the remaining scales used in this study, participants were asked \nto indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with statements on a seven-point scale \nranging from \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d = 1 to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d = 7.  \nOrganizational work-home culture was measured using Thompson et al.\u2019s (1999) \nthree-component scale. Items assessed the extent to which respondents perceived that \nmanagers in their organization were understanding of work-home issues (managerial support), \nthat career progression in their organization was negatively affected by having personal or \nfamily responsibilities (negative career consequences), and that job success in their \norganization was dependent upon sacrificing personal time for work (organizational time \ndemands). Sample items include \u201cIn general, managers in this organization are quite \naccommodating of personal or family-related needs\u201d (managerial support); \u201cMany employees \nare resentful when men in this organization take leave to care for newborn or adopted \nchildren\u201d (negative career consequences); \u201cEmployees are regularly expected to put their jobs \nbefore their personal lives or families\u201d (organizational time demands). Reliability alphas were \n.94 for organizational time demands, .77 for negative career consequences, and .91 for \nmanagerial support. \nWork interference with home was measured using the six time-based and strain-based \nitems from Carlson, Kacmar, and Williams\u2019s (2000) multidimensional measure of work-\nfamily conflict. The statements were modified in order to be applicable to respondents both \nwith and without family responsibilities. For example, \u201cI have to miss family activities due to \nthe amount of time I must spend on work responsibilities\u201d was modified to read, \u201cI have to \nmiss family or social activities due to the amount of time I must spend on work \nresponsibilities\u201d. Items assessed the extent to which respondents experienced both time- and \nstrain-based interference from the work to the home domain. The reliability alpha for this \nscale was .92. \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   19 \n \nHome interference with work was measured using the six time-based and strain-based \nitems from Carlson et al.\u2019s (2000) measure of work-family conflict. Again, items were \nmodified in order to be applicable to respondents both with and without family \nresponsibilities. Items assessed the extent to which respondents experienced both time- and \nstrain-based interference from the home to the work domain (e.g., \u201cTension and anxiety from \nmy personal or family life often weakens my ability to do my job\u201d). Cronbach\u2019s alpha for this \nscale was .84. \nMeasurement models \nBefore the hypotheses were tested, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was \nconducted to examine the distinctiveness of the measures used in this study, using Amos \nsoftware and maximum-likelihood estimation. Goodness of fit was interpreted using the \ncomparative fit index (CFI), normed fit index (NFI), and root mean square error of \napproximation (RMSEA), and commonly accepted cutoff values (CFI < .90, NFI < .90, and \nRMSEA > .08) were used as indicative of poor fit (e.g., McDonald and Ho, 2002). A one-\nfactor model, in which all items in all measures loaded on a common factor, was compared \nwith the hypothesized six factor model in which strain, work interference with home, home \ninterference with work, managerial support, negative career consequences, and organizational \ntime demands loaded on distinct factors. This model produced better fit (\uf0632 = 1256.56, df = \n615; CFI = .90, NFI = .81, RMSEA = .07) than the one-factor model, and all factor loadings \nwere significant, warranting the examination of the variables as distinct constructs.  \nTo alleviate concerns about the potential for common method variance to account for \nrelationships discovered amongst these variables, confirmatory factor analysis was also used \nto determine the prevalence of common method variance in the data. Using Harmon\u2019s single-\nfactor test (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff, 2003), the lack of fit of the single-\nfactor measurement model can be interpreted to mean that common method variance was not \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   20 \n \na sizeable problem. This test does have limitations, however, so an additional approach was \ntaken: an examination of the results of adding a latent common methods factor to the \nhypothesized six-factor measurement model (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The potential increase in \nmodel fit obtainable by accounting for the common methods factor was explored, as well as \nthe variance extracted by this common factor. The first examination of this model yielded a \nnegative error variance for one of the items measuring organizational time demands, so the \nmodel was rerun with the associated error variance fixed to zero (Dillon, Kumar, and Mulani, \n1987). The fit of this model was slightly superior to that of the hypothesized six-factor model \n(\uf0632 = 1030.95, df = 578; CFI = .93, NFI = .85, RMSEA = .06), but the variance extracted by \nthe common methods factor was only .20, which falls below the .50 cutoff that Hair, \nAnderson, Tatham, and Black (1998) suggest as indicating the presence of a latent factor \nrepresenting the manifest indicators. Consequently, although it is possible that common \nmethod variance may be present in the data, it does not appear as though common methods \nbias was a serious issue hindering the satisfactory testing of our hypotheses.  \nAnalysis \nOLS regression analysis was used to test the model, using SPSS 16.0 software. \nControl variables were entered in step 1 of the equation, followed by work-home culture in \nstep 2. In the third step, work interference with home and home interference with work were \nentered. The interaction terms were entered in the final fourth step, permitting the significance \nof the interactions to be determined after controlling for the main effects of the independent \nvariables. The predictor variables were centred before forming interaction terms, in order to \nreduce the multicollinearity often associated with regression equations containing interaction \nterms (Aiken and West, 1991). Changes in R\n2\n were used to evaluate the ability of the \ninteraction terms to explain variance beyond that accounted for by the main effects in the \nequation. \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   21 \n \nThe control variables included were hours worked weekly, presence of children aged 16 \nand under in the respondent\u2019s household (present\/absent, dummy-coded), and current use of at \nleast one work-home option provided by the organization, such as flexitime or telework \n(use\/non-use, dummy-coded). In previous research, these demographic variables have been \nestablished as important explanatory variables in their own right in terms of strain. Individuals \nwith young children have been found more likely to show signs of psychological disturbance \n(Elliott and Huppert, 1991), and working long hours is a confirmed source of strain (Jex and \nBliese, 1999). Employees using some form of flexible working offered by their employers have \nbeen found to report better psychological health than those not using such work-home options \n(Houston and Waumsley, 2003). \nTo test for mediation, the procedure recommended by Baron and Kenny (1986) was \nused, and the Aroian test conducted (MacKinnon, Warsi, and Dwyer, 1995). For these \nanalyses, men and women were treated as separate samples. In the Baron and Kenny \nprocedure, three regression models are investigated. First, the mediator (work-home \ninterference) is regressed on the independent variables (work-home culture); second, the \ndependent variable (strain) is regressed on the independent variables (work-home culture); \nand third, the dependent variable (strain) is regressed simultaneously on the independent \n(work-home culture) and mediator (work-home interference) variables.  \nMediation is present if the following conditions hold true: the independent variable \naffects the mediator in the first equation; the independent variable affects the dependent \nvariable in the second equation; and the mediator affects the dependent variable in the third \nequation. The effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable must be less in the \nthird equation than in the second. Full mediation occurs if the independent variable has no \nsignificant effect when the mediator is in the equation, and partial mediation occurs if the \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   22 \n \neffect of the independent variable is smaller but significant when the mediator is in the \nequation.  \nWith regard to moderation, significant interactions were probed using procedures \nrecommended by Aiken and West (1991). The regression equation was restructured to \nrepresent the regression of employee strain on the independent variables at different levels of \nwork-home culture. Low, medium, and high values of work-home culture were established \n(Cohen and Cohen, 1983) and entered into the transformed regression equation so as to \ncalculate three regression equations. Low, medium, and high values of work-home culture \nwere calculated as one standard deviation below the mean, the mean, and one standard \ndeviation above the mean, respectively. T-tests were then performed on simple slopes of the \nequations to determine if they differed from zero. In addition, the Dawson and Richter (2006) \ntest for differences between slopes was used to probe gender differences in significant three-\nway interactions. \nResults \nDescriptive statistics and direct effects \nThe means and standard deviations for each of the study variables are shown in Table \n1, along with t-test results for differences between men and women in their average scores. \nWith regard to work-home culture, men reported significantly higher levels of organizational \ntime demands (t = 2.09, p < .05) and negative career consequences (t = 1.98, p < .05) than did \nwomen. Men also worked significantly longer hours than did women (t = 3.68, p < .001).  \n (Tables 1 and 2 about here) \nCorrelations among the variables are displayed in Table 2, and the results of the \nregression analyses are presented in Table 3. Hypotheses 1a and 1b were not supported. None \nof the work-home culture variables had a significant, direct relationship with strain when all \nother variables were present in the equation.  \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   23 \n \n(Table 3 about here) \nIndirect effects \nThe results of the mediation analyses are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Hypothesis 2 \nwas partially supported; work interference with home fully mediated the effects of \norganizational time demands on strain for women, and partially mediated the effects of \norganizational time demands on strain for men. An Aroian test with the unstandardized \ncoefficients and standard errors (MacKinnon et al., 1995) supported a significant indirect \neffect of organizational time demands on strain through work interference with home for \nwomen (Z score = 4.32, p < .001), and for men (Z score = 2.06, p < .05). Neither managerial \nsupport nor negative career consequences was mediated by either work interference with \nhome, or home interference with work.  \n (Tables 4 and 5 about here) \nHypothesis 3a was partially supported; the hypothesized two-way interaction between \nwork interference with home and managerial support was significant (\u03b2 = -.16, p < .05). As \ndepicted in Figure 2, simple slope analysis (Aiken and West, 1991) revealed that the \nrelationship between work interference with home and employee strain was weaker in the \npresence of high levels of managerial support (one SD above the mean; \u03b2 = .29, p < .01) than \nin the presence of low levels of managerial support (one SD below the mean; \u03b2 = .65, p < \n.001). \n(Figure 2 about here) \nManagerial support did not moderate the link between home interference with work \nand strain. Organizational time demands and negative career consequences were not \nsignificant moderators of either direction of work-home interference, providing no support for \nHypothesis 3b. \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   24 \n \nNo support was found for Hypotheses 4a or 4b; there were no significant interactions \nbetween sex and work-home culture. Hypothesis 5a, predicting a stronger mediated \nrelationship between managerial support and strain for women than for men, was not \nsupported. Hypothesis 5b was not supported either, as the mediated relationship between \norganizational time demands and strain was stronger for women, rather than for men as was \npredicted (see results for Hypothesis 2 above). For women, the indirect effect of \norganizational time demands on strain, (.57)(.55), = .31, and its direct effect is .30, yielding a \ntotal effect coefficient of .61. Accordingly, .31\/.61, 51% of the effect of organizational time \ndemands on strain is mediated through work interference with home, and .30\/.61 = 49% is \ndirect. For men, 28% of the effect of organizational time demands on strain is mediated by \nwork interference with home, and 72% is direct. These direct effects may, of course, include \nthe effects of mediators not included in the present model. \nHypothesis 6a was partially supported. A significant three-way interaction predicting \nstrain was found among sex, managerial support, and work interference with home (\u03b2 = -.17, \np < .05), such that the positive relationship between work interference with home and strain \nwas weaker in the presence of high managerial support more so for women than for men (see \nFigure 3). The Dawson and Richter (2006) test revealed a significant difference between the \nslopes for high managerial support women and low managerial support women (t = - 2.71, p < \n.01), whereas the difference between the slopes for high managerial support men and low \nmanagerial support men was not significant. There was no significant three-way interaction \ninvolving sex, managerial support, and home interference with work.   \n(Figure 3 about here) \nHypothesis 6b was also partially supported. Although there were no significant three-\nway interactions involving negative career consequences, significant interactions were found \namong sex, organizational time demands, and both work interference with home (\u03b2 = .18, p < \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   25 \n \n.05) and home interference with work (\u03b2 = -.21, p < .05). As predicted, the positive \nrelationship between work interference with home and strain was stronger in the presence of \nhigh organizational time demands more so for men than for women, as depicted in Figure 4. \nThe Dawson and Richter (2006) test demonstrated a significant difference in the predicted \ndirection between the slopes for high organizational time demands men and low \norganizational time demands men (t = 1.92, p < .05), but not for high organizational time \ndemands women and low organizational time demands women. Contrary to predictions, \nhowever, there was a stronger link between home interference with work and strain for \nwomen, rather than men, when organizational time demands were high (see Figure 5). The \ndifference between the slopes for high organizational time demands women and low \norganizational time demands women was significant in the hypothesized direction (t = 1.65, p \n< .05), whereas that for high organizational time demands men and low organizational time \ndemands men was not. \n(Figures 4 and 5 about here) \nDiscussion \nThe aim of this study was to determine how work-home culture influences employee \nwell-being, and whether sex differences exist in the relationships between these variables. To \ndo so, a model with a mix of mediated and moderated relationships was tested. Findings \nindicate that an organization\u2019s support for work-home issues has a significant impact on \nemployees\u2019 well-being. This effect takes place indirectly for women, by influencing their \nlevel of work-home interference, and operates both directly and indirectly for men. Different \ntypes of organizational work-home support were also found to be effective for women \ncompared to men.  \nSome of the study\u2019s findings are consistent with previous research, while others \nextend knowledge in the field. The study extends previous research in several ways: by \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   26 \n \ninvestigating all three possible routes by which work-home culture may influence employee \nstrain; by demonstrating that work interference with home mediates the relationship between \none of the components of work-home culture \u2013 organizational time demands \u2013 and strain; by \nshowing that organizational time demands has a moderating influence on the link between \nwork-home interference and strain; and by revealing sex differences in these relationships.  \nResults indicate that for the employees in this study, work-home culture is, largely, \nindirectly rather than directly related to strain. The effect of organizational time demands on \nstrain symptomology was fully mediated by work interference with home for women, and \npartially mediated for men. For the participants in this study, the degree to which \norganizational norms demand that employees subjugate their personal lives to their work \nresponsibilities influenced the amount of work interference with home experienced, which in \nturn predicted increased levels of psychosomatic symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue, and \ndepression. Contrary to predictions, this mediated relationship was stronger for women than \nfor men. Given that society continues to emphasize women\u2019s responsibilities as primary \ncaretakers of home and family, there is a certain logic to the idea that for women, the route to \nstrain from organizational time demands would involve a diminished ability to deal with \nhome-related demands. For men, who are subject to greater societal expectations to prioritize \nthe work role, it makes sense that this type of pressure from the organization renders them \nmore vulnerable to reduced levels of well-being directly, in addition to increased levels of \nwork interference with home.  \nIn addition to the mediation effects described above, evidence for moderation was also \nfound. Women reporting high levels of managerial support were less likely to experience \nstrain as a result of work interference with home than were women reporting lower levels of \nsupport. This finding supports previous research by O\u2019Driscoll et al. (2003), who found that \nthe effect of work interference with home on psychological strain was moderated by work-\nWork-home culture and employee well-being   27 \n \nhome related supervisor support. Managers who offer emotional and\/or instrumental support \nfor their employees\u2019 work-home concerns appear able to reduce the extent to which their \nsubordinates \u2013 at least, their female subordinates - suffer strain arising from the interference \nof work demands with their responsibilities at home. An employee whose long work hours are \ninterfering with her ability to spend time with friends or family is liable to experience less \nstrain when management appears supportive and willing to help than when management is \nperceived as uncaring and not interested in employees\u2019 lives beyond the workplace. This \neffect did not take place for men, suggesting that they are less responsive to this type of \nsupport. This is perhaps due to gender norms stipulating independence for men, and \ndiscouraging them from seeking or accepting assistance from others (Helgeson, 2005).   \nOrganizational time demands moderated the links between work interference with \nhome and employee strain for men, and between home interference with work and strain for \nwomen. Under conditions of low organizational time demands, there was virtually no \nrelationship between work interference with home and strain for men. A significant, positive \nrelationship between interference and strain was present only under conditions of high \norganizational time demands. For women, the association between work interference with \nhome and strain was positive regardless of organizational time demands. This finding adds \nanother dimension to the literature on men and work-home culture. We know that men \nperceive higher levels of organizational time demands, and that they are subject to stricter \nsanctions for not complying with them (Beauregard, 2006; Powell, 1997). Now we also see \nthat organizational time demands have the power to regulate some of the negative \nrepercussions of work interference with home that men experience. When time demands are \nlow, even though work hours themselves may remain high, men will not experience strain as \na result of their work commitments interfering with their personal lives.  \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   28 \n \nFor women, a different relationship was found with regard to organizational time \ndemands and home interference with work. When organizational time demands were high, a \nsignificant, positive relationship between interference and strain was present. Under \nconditions of low organizational time demands, women experienced decreasing amounts of \nstrain as home interference with work increased. We can interpret this result using the \nconservation of resources theory of stress (Hobfoll, 1989), which posits that interference \nbetween work and home results in stress (or strain) because valued resources are lost in the \nprocess of balancing demands from both domains (Grandey and Cropanzano, 1999). \nIndividuals with greater resources are more capable of resource gain, while those with fewer \nresources are more vulnerable to resource loss (Hobfoll, 2001). In support of this proposition, \nprevious research has found that women in possession of at least one type of individual \nresource (such as spousal support, or self-control skills) experienced less work-home \ninterference than women with no such resources (Rosenbaum and Cohen, 1999). In the \npresent study, women with access to the resource of low levels of organizational time \ndemands appear less susceptible to some of the negative repercussions of home interference \nwith work; this resource appears to act as a buffer against the outcome of strain.  \nThe question remains, why was this moderated relationship between home \ninterference with work and strain not found for men? The results of this study show that \norganizational time demands disproportionately affect men. One possible explanation derives \nfrom the fact that, as discussed previously, women tend to have more responsibility than men \ndo for dealing with home-related demands (Nordenmark, 2004). When the employing \norganization pressures women to spend more time in the work role, this may render women \nless likely to be able to manage home demands while simultaneously living up to the \norganization\u2019s expectations. Women are thus \u201cstuck between a rock and a hard place\u201d \u2013 \ncaught between organizational expectations for their time, and societal expectations for \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   29 \n \npriority given to the home role. Men may be unlikely to feel these competing pressures as \nkeenly, as there is less of a disconnect between organizational and societal expectations of \ntheir primary role - both emphasize men\u2019s role as paid workers. Hence, the effect of \norganizational time demands on the link between home interference with work and strain \nwould not be as strong for men as it is for women. \nManagement implications \nThe results of this study highlight the link between work-home interference and well-\nbeing, demonstrating a strong positive relationship between interference and strain. The \ndeleterious effects of strain on employee job performance are well-known, and include \nincreased absenteeism and turnover intentions, as well as reduced productivity (e.g., \nArsenault and Dolan, 1983; O\u2019Driscoll and Beehr, 1994; Veloutsou and Panigyrakis, 2004). It \nis, therefore, clearly in management\u2019s interest to initiate efforts to reduce the work-home \ninterference, and thereby the strain, of their workforce. While the implementation of work-\nhome options such as flexible working hours, childcare and eldercare referral services, and \nteleworking has been linked to lower levels of work-home interference, absenteeism, and \nturnover intentions (Anderson et al., 2002; Dalton and Mesch, 1990; Thompson et al., 1999), \nit is widely acknowledged that the mere availability of options is not sufficient to diminish the \ndetrimental outcomes of interference to a large degree. The findings of the present study, in \nwhich a strong link was established between interference and strain despite controlling for the \nstudy participants\u2019 use of work-home options, supports this view. The development of an \norganizational culture supportive of work-home balance is necessary for organizations to fully \nreap the benefits of their work-home options and alleviate work-home interference (see \nBeauregard and Henry, 2009, for a review).  \nIn this study, interference has been shown to increase when employees perceive that \ntheir co-workers, superiors, and the organization in general expect them to put in long hours \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   30 \n \nand assign priority to work over home in order to progress in their careers. Management of \nsuch expectations is an area in which managers can and should play a key role. Long hours \nand an emphasis on presenteeism is generally thought to be unrelated to productivity, and \nmay even be detrimental to employee performance (Simpson, 2002). Increasing awareness of \nunreasonable expectations among management and staff and addressing the potentially \nnegative consequences of taking leave for personal reasons could contribute to a shift in \nworkplace culture to acknowledge the importance of employees\u2019 family and non-work roles. \nThis culture change is overdue and entirely necessary should managers wish to reduce levels \nof work-home interference amongst their employees. Making a special effort to encourage \nmen in their efforts to balance work and home demands may help to reduce some of the sex \ndifferences identified in this study, and create a more level playing field, as recommended by \nCornelius and Skinner (2008) in an earlier volume of this journal.  \nThe knowledge that managerial work-home support can work to reduce the amount of \nstrain experienced by employees as a result of work interference with home may also lend \nitself to practical initiatives. Assessment of managers\u2019 work-home awareness and \neffectiveness in rendering assistance to affected employees could be incorporated into the \nperformance appraisal process, as a means of strengthening management incentive to work \nwith employees towards a solution to the problem of interference. Increased managerial \nsupport for work-home issues may then have a \u201ctop-down\u201d effect on improving staff attitudes \ntowards employees taking time off for personal or family reasons. Measures to ensure that \nabsent employees\u2019 workloads are not routinely reallocated to remaining employees without \nsome form of compensation or recognition (e.g., extra vacation days) may also help to \neradicate co-worker resentment toward those struggling to balance competing work and home \ndemands.  \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   31 \n \nLimitations and Future Research \nSome limitations to the present study should be noted. The cross-sectional design of \nthe study does not allow for conclusions regarding causality. It is possible that an employee\u2019s \nexperience of work-home interference may result in the conclusion that his or her employing \norganization is unsupportive of work-home issues, or that strain contributes to employee \nlevels of work-home interference. Future research employing a longitudinal design would be \nbetter placed to assess issues of directionality, and research collecting multi-source data \nwould be better placed to avoid the potential for common method bias associated with the use \nof a single data source, such as the self-report questionnaires employed by the present study. \n None of the interactions explained a significant amount of variance in the dependent \nvariable; a larger sample size may have produced better results, and would also help to ensure \ngreater accuracy and generalizability of results in future, as would a higher response rate than \nthat obtained by the present study. The average age of the youngest child for participants in \nthis study was in the early teens; respondents with younger families may have different \nexperiences balancing work and home responsibilities, which may have generated different \nfindings.  \nThis study\u2019s findings regarding the moderating role of work-home culture in the \nrelationship between work-home interference and strain generate a number of research \nquestions. Might other coping resources, such as scheduling activities in one domain to \naccommodate demands in the other, also influence the degree to which interference between \nwork and home affects employee strain? Do elements of work-home culture moderate the link \nbetween work-home interference and other organizational outcomes, such as commitment or \nworkplace deviance? Research investigating group or organization level outcomes such as \nthese may wish to treat work-home culture as a group level variable, and assess the level of \nagreement among respondents in a particular work group or organization, rather than view \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   32 \n \nperceptions of work-home culture as an individual level variable as done in the present study \n(and in the preponderance of work-life balance research). Examining gender differences in \ndual-earner couples at the level of the couple may also yield revealing findings concerning \ncross-over effects of organizational support on work-home interference and strain.  \nBecause the respondent sample was composed entirely of public sector employees, it \nis a matter of debate as to whether the findings obtained can be generalized to other \npopulations, such as individuals employed in the private sector. A number of differences have \nbeen shown to exist between public sector and private sector employees with regard to \nexpectations of and satisfaction with work-home interference. For instance, compared to their \ncounterparts in the private sector, public sector workers have been found to report higher \nlevels of stress, be more critical of their organisations, have less trust and confidence in their \nsenior managers, and perceive less employer fulfilment of the psychological contract with \nregard to work-life balance promises (CIPD, 2006; Willemab, De Vosc, and Buelens, 2010). \nWhile public sector workers report greater levels of satisfaction with their working hours, \ndisplaying a preference for trading off work challenge and pay in exchange for reduced work-\nhome interference, they do not report greater levels of organisational assistance with work-\nhome interference than do those employed in the private sector (Buelens and Van den Broeck, \n2007; CIPD, 2006; Ipsos MORI, 2006). These differences may influence the extent to which \nthe relationships among variables found in this study are applicable to employees of private \nsector organizations.  \nIt is worth noting, however, that while this sample of UK public sector employees may \nbe quite specific, these employees differ in age, socio-economic status, intelligence, \nhardiness, and so on. The relationships among the variables tested can therefore be presumed \nto exist despite such differences among the survey respondents, rendering generalizability \nsomewhat less of a problem (Cook and Campbell, 1979). Still, future research comparing \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   33 \n \npublic to private sector employees may reveal differences in the way each responds to \norganizational work-home culture, and thus yield meaningful implications for how \norganizations in each sector should provide and communicate work-home support.  \n \n \n \nWork-home culture and employee well-being   34 \n \nReferences \nAddis, M.
