LLOYD*\nDepartment of Geography, University of Durham, South Road, Durham, DH1 3LE, UK\nABSTRACT\nBenthic foraminifera were investigated from 20 grab\nsamples collected from a large marine embayment, Disko\nBugt, along the west Greenland margin. Agglutinated and\ncalcareous foraminifera were found throughout Disko Bugt,\nwith agglutinated species dominating 19 out of the 20 samples.\nThe most common species are Adercotryma glomerata,\nSpiroplectammina biformis, Textularia earlandi, Cribrosto-\nmoides crassimargo and Reophax fusiformis. Six faunal\nassemblage zones were identified from cluster analysis and\ndetrended correspondence analysis. The relationship between\nthe foraminifera and environmental variables was investigated\nusing canonical correspondence analysis. From this analysis,\nbottom water salinity and water depth were identified as the\nmost important environmental variables explaining the fora-\nminiferal assemblages. This result suggests water mass\ncharacteristics in Disko Bugt are an important control on the\nbenthic foraminiferal assemblage zones. Where the warm and\nsaline West Greenland Current water mass impinges on the\nseafloor, the assemblage is dominated by A. glomerata, T.\nearlandi, R. fusiformis and Reophax pilulifer. Sites with the\ncold, lower salinity Polar Water mass at the seafloor are\ndominated by S. biformis and A. glomerata, with common\nCuneata arctica and C. crassimargo. In shallow locations with\na relatively warm and low salinity surface water mass and\ncoarse sediments the fauna is dominated by Cibicides\nlobatulus. In similar hydrographic locations with fine-grained\nsediments a mixed faunal assemblage dominated by Ammos-\ncalaria pseudospiralis and Eggerella advena is found.\nINTRODUCTION\nStudies of the present day distribution of foraminifera\nfrom high latitude continental shelves in recent decades\nhave increased our understanding of these sensitive\nenvironments. In particular, such studies have provided\ncontemporary analogues for paleoenvironmental recon-\nstructions, increasing our understanding of the interaction\nbetween climate change and high-latitude environments\n(e.g., Osterman and Nelson, 1989; Bilodeau and others,\n1994; Jennings and others, 1996; Polyak and Mikhailov,\n1996; Jennings and others, 2002). There have, however,\nbeen few studies of foraminifera from the west Greenland\nmargin. Herman and others (1972) investigated foraminif-\nera from southwest Greenland fjord sediments; Feyling-\nHanssen and Funder (1990) investigated the foraminiferal\nfauna from a number of sections near Thule in northwest\nGreenland; and Elberling and others (2003) used forami-\nniferal stratigraphy to investigate pollution in a west\nGreenland fjord. Studies have tended to concentrate on\nthe east Greenland margin (e.g., Jennings and Helgadottir,\n1994; Jennings and Weiner, 1996; Madsen and Knudsen,\n1994) and the Canadian Arctic and Arctic Ocean (e.g.,\nVilks, 1969, 1980, 1989; Osterman, 1984; Schafer and Cole,\n1986; Schroder-Adams and others, 1990a; Scott and Vilks,\n1991; Bilodeau and others, 1994; Wollenburg and Mack-\nensen, 1998a, 1998b). In this paper, foraminiferal, conduc-\ntivity-temperature-depth profiles (CTD) and sedimentolog-\nical data are presented from a large marine embayment,\nDisko Bugt, along the west Greenland margin and the\nassociation of faunal assemblages with environmental and\nsedimentological variables is investigated. Disko Bugt is\na particularly interesting location to investigate due to the\nrelatively large proportion of the Greenland ice sheet that\ndrains out through this section of the west coast. Disko\nBugt receives the output from Jakobshavn Isbrae, one of\nthe fastest moving ice streams in the world, draining\napproximately 7% of the Greenland ice sheet (Clarke and\nEchelmeyer, 1996; Bindschadler, 1984). Disko Bugt is,\ntherefore, one of the most important outlets of meltwater\nand icebergs from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Deep and\nshallow water circulation are highly sensitive to such\nmeltwater fluxes. This area is also close to the Labrador\nSea, which, along with the Nordic Seas, is the main area of\ndeepwater formation at the present day in the Northern\nHemisphere (e.g., Hillaire-Marcel and others, 2001). It is,\ntherefore, important to understand the link between iceberg\nand meltwater flux from Disko Bugt and the impact on\nocean circulation. This study provides baseline data that\ncan be used as a basis for paleoenvironmental reconstruc-\ntion from core material collected from Disko Bugt.\nTHE STUDY AREA\nDisko Bugt is a large embayment in the west coast of\nGreenland (Fig. 1). The embayment is relatively shallow,\nwith water depths ranging from 200 m to 400 m, but with\na trough up to 990 m deep at its western edge. This deep-\nwater trough, \u2018\u2018Egedesminde Dyb\u2019\u2019 (Fig. 2), extends beyond\nDisko Bugt towards a major fan system at the edge of the\ncontinental shelf (Brett and Zarudzki, 1979). At the last\nglacial maximum, the Greenland Ice Sheet extended west\nbeyond Disko Bugt some distance across the continental shelf\n(Funder and Hansen, 1996). Egedesminde Dyb was most\nlikely produced by glacial erosion by the Jakobshavn\nIcestream during such periods of ice extension (Long and\nRoberts, 2003). Indeed a series of ridges midway across the\ncontinental shelf seaward of the entrance to Disko Bugt have\nbeen interpreted as moraines marking ice-limit positions\nduring previous glaciations (Brett and Zarudzki, 1979). Some\nof the major fjord systems draining the inland ice are also\ndeeper than 600 m; for example, Torssukatak is over 800 m\n(northern Disko Bugt) and Jakobshavn Isfjord, emptying\ninto central Disko Bugt, is over 1000 m deep in places.* E-mail: J.M.Lloyd@durham.ac.uk\nJournal of Foraminiferal Research, v. 36, no. 4, p. 315\u2013331, October 2006\n315\nThe northward-flowing West Greenland Current (WGC)\ndominates the present day surface ocean circulation in this\narea (Fig. 1). The WGC forms from two distinct currents\nfound off southern and eastern Greenland, the cold and\nrelatively fresh East Greenland Current (EGC), originating\nfrom the Arctic Ocean, and the warm relatively saline\nIrminger Current (IC), an extension of the North Atlantic\nCurrent (Andersen, 1981). On rounding Cape Farvel (the\nsouthern tip of Greenland), these two currents mix to form\nthe WGC, which then flows through Davis Strait into\nBaffin Bay. A cyclonic gyre forms in Baffin Bay as the\nWGC flows north then turns west at several locations and\nmixes with the cold and relatively fresh water Baffin\nCurrent. The Baffin Current enters Baffin Bay from the\nArctic Ocean via several narrow straits (Barrow Strait,\nSmith Sound, Jones Sound and Lancaster Sound; Ingram\nand Prinsenberg, 1998), flows south along the coast of\nBaffin Island, and mixes with the WGC and Hudson Strait\nwater to form the Labrador Current south of the Davis\nStrait. The WGC is not fully mixed on rounding Cape\nFarvel; a poorly mixed component of the EGC actually\nflows northwards as a shallow coastal current termed Polar\nWater by Buch (1993). The IC component flows north-\nwards below and to the west of this Polar Water and is\nbounded to the west by the relatively cold Baffin Current\n(BC). The two water masses continue to mix within the\nWGC on their journey northwards, but can still be\ndistinguished to the southwest of Disko Bugt (Andersen,\n1981). Off southern Greenland, the main core of the IC\ncomponent of the WGC has a temperature of 4\u20137.3 uC and\nsalinity close to 35 psu; by the time it reaches the latitude of\nDisko Bugt, due to cooling and mixing with the EGC\ncomponent, it has a temperature of 2.5\u20133.5 uC and salinity\nof 34.5\u201334.8 psu (Andersen, 1981). The coastal EGC\ncomponent also receives input of relatively cold and fresh\nwater from the western margins of Greenland and has\ntemperatures ranging from 1\u20133 uC and salinity of 32\u2013\n33.7 psu (Andersen, 1981; Buch and Stein, 1989; Buch,\n2000). Water circulation and the water masses within Disko\nBugt are heavily influenced by the components of the WGC\nentering the bay from the southwest shown in figure 2\n(Andersen, 1981). Due to the relatively shallow nature of\nthe embayment, the colder deeper water within Baffin Bay,\nthe Baffin Bay Deep Water (Osterman and Nelson, 1989),\ndoes not penetrate Disko Bugt. Disko Bugt is also\ninfluenced by the annual formation of sea ice during\nDecember\u2013January and melting by April\u2013May (Andersen,\n1981), and significant meltwater flux from coastal glaciers\nand icebergs. Based on measurements from 1971 to 2000,\non average, sea ice forms in Disko Bugt from mid to late\nDecember, reaches a southern maximum position of\napproximately 65 uN by late February, then retreats from\nDisko Bugt during late April to May (Environment\nCanada, 2002). The melting of icebergs and sea ice produces\na steep halocline and thermocline during summer, with\nfresher and colder water down to between 150 and 200 m\nand warmer more-saline deeper water (Andersen, 1981).\nAutumn storminess and subsequent formation of sea ice\nbreak down the halocline and thermocline.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe samples used in this study were collected during\nAugust and September 1999 during a cruise on the Danish\nresearch vessel Porsild. Grab samples were collected in\nDisko Bugt using a Van Veen sampler at each of the sample\nsites shown in figure 2.\nFIGURE 1.

In the laboratory, a standard\nvolume of sediment (10 ml) was sieved at 63 mm, and\nforaminifera counted from the wet residue fraction coarser\nthan 63 mm (samples were counted wet to reduce any loss,\ncaused by drying, of the more fragile arenaceous species,\nas advocated by Scott and Vilks, 1991). Foraminifera from\nhigh latitude areas have been counted from various size\nfractions, and there has been some debate about the size\nfraction most suitable for counting; coarser than 63 mm,\n100 mm or 125 mm (Schro\u00a8der and others, 1987; Jennings\nand Helgadottir, 1994). In this study, the use of the coarser\nthan 63 mm fraction is advocated for two reasons; firstly\nto allow comparability with other studies from the Baffin\nBay-Canadian Arctic region and northwest Atlantic high\nlatitudes in general (e.g., Williamson and others, 1984;\nSchafer and Cole, 1986; Vilks and Deonarine, 1988;\nSchro\u00a8der-Adams and others, 1990a, 1990b; Scott and Vilks,\n1991); secondly for the practical reason that foramini-\nferal absolute abundances are relatively low in this area.\nThe use of the finer sieve fraction in this study will have\nan influence on comparison with studies using a coarser\nfraction, predominantly those from the eastern or \u2018\u2018Euro-\npean\u2019\u2019 Arctic (e.g., Madsen and Knudsen, 1994; Hald\nand Korsun, 1997; Rytter and others, 2002; Husum and\nHald, 2004). The finer fraction used in this study will\nproduce a relatively higher proportion of smaller taxa\nsuch as Cuneata arctica, Textularia earlandi, Spiroplectam-\nmina biformis and Reophax gracilis. Whilst direct compar-\nison with studies using a coarser fraction may not be\npossible, general comparisons between the fauna can\nstill provide useful information and are made in the\ndiscussion.\nWhere possible at least 300 specimens were counted from\neach sample, although in some samples with low abun-\ndances this was not possible (counts of over 100 were made\nfrom all samples). Although the samples were stained with\nrose Bengal to identify living specimens, statistical analysis\nand discussion of assemblages is based on the total (living\nplus dead) specimens. This is due to problems identifying\nlive specimens from the samples. It proved difficult to\nidentify whether many of the agglutinated specimens had\ntaken up the stain. Since the fauna in Disko Bugt is\ndominated by agglutinated specimens, it was decided to use\ntotal specimens in analysis. The use of live, dead or total\nassemblages has been discussed extensively in the literature,\nand it has been argued that total assemblages are more\nlikely to be comparable to fossil assemblages, and therefore\nof more use in environmental reconstruction (Scott and\nMedioli, 1980; Jennings and Helgadottir, 1994; Hald and\nKorsun, 1997). However, other studies have argued that to\nprovide a full understanding of the relationship between\nfauna and environmental variables and also possible post-\nmortem changes in the fauna, the live and dead fauna\nshould be evaluated separately (Murray, 1982; Murray and\nAlve, 1999; Murray, 2000). Unfortunately, due to the\nproblems mentioned above in this study, only total\nassemblages could be evaluated.\nENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES\nEight environmental variables were recorded for each site\n[water depth, bottom water temperature, bottom water\nsalinity, percent of clay, silt and sand, total organic carbon\n(TOC) and total nitrogen (TN)]. During the cruise, water\ndepth was measured at each site and a CTD hydrographic\nprofile collected using a Seabird Electronics (SeaLogger 25)\nsystem. Data collected from the CTD included temperature\nand salinity. Clay, silt and sand fractions were measured in\nthe laboratory using a Coulter Counter laser granulometer.\nTotal organic carbon was measured using a Thermo\nFinnigan Total Carbon Analyzer with solids module. Total\nnitrogen was measured using a Costech Instruments\nelemental combustion system. For both TOC and TN,\nsamples were freeze-dried and ball-milled to produce\na homogeneous sample for analysis.\nDATA ANALYSIS\nCluster analysis and detrended correpondence analysis\n(DCA) were used to analyze the benthic foraminiferal\nassemblage data. Only species that reach an abundance of\n.2% in at least 1 sample were used in data analysis.\nUnconstrained incremental sum-of-squares cluster analysis,\nbased on unweighted Euclidean distance, was used to\nclassify the samples into homogeneous clusters (Prentice,\n1986; Van Tongeren, 1987). Cluster analysis, which is an\neffective way of classifying the samples according to the\nforaminiferal assemblage, was carried out using the TILIA\nprogram (Grimm, 1987, 1993).\nDetrended correspondence analysis was applied to\nrepresent samples as points in a multi-dimensional space,\nin which similar samples are located together, while\ndissimilar samples tend to be dispersed. Detrended corre-\nspondence analysis provides a means of evaluating the\nreliability of cluster analysis (Prentice, 1986), and was\ncarried out using the CANOCO program, version 4.51 (Ter\nBraak, 1988).\nThe relationship between the 8 environmental variables\nand the foraminiferal species data was investigated using\ncanonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Canonical cor-\nrespondence analysis is used to extract synthetic environ-\nmental gradients from ecological datasets (Ter Braak,\n1986). The independence and relative strength of individual\nenvironmental gradients were estimated using a series of\npartial CCAs (Borcard and others, 1992). The significance\nof the relationship between species and environmental\nvariables calculated using CCA was tested using a Monte\nCarlo permutations test to calculate the F-ratio and P-value\nbased on the sum of all canonical eigenvalues. The CCA\nanalyses used the CANOCO program, release 4.51 (Ter\nBraak, 1988).\nRESULTS\nTHE WATER MASSES OF DISKO BUGT\nThe CTD data (Fig. 3) show a relatively consistent\npattern throughout Disko Bugt. Three distinct water\nmasses can be identified based on salinity and temperature\ncharacteristics that broadly correspond to the water masses\nFORAMINIFERA FROM DISKO BUGT, GREENLAND 317\nidentified by Andersen (1981) and Buch and Stein (1989)\ndiscussed earlier. These are surface water (temperature 4\u20138\nuC, salinity below 33.4 psu) generally found from 0\u201350 m,\nbut as deep as 100 m; Polar Water (temperature 1\u20133 uC,\nsalinity 33\u201333.9 psu) with varying thickness and position in\nthe water column between 50\u2013280 m depending on loca-\ntion; WGC water (temperature 2.5\u20134 uC, salinity . 34 psu)\nfound below 200\u2013280 m throughout Disko Bugt. The\nrelative thickness of these water masses is controlled by\nthe location within Disko Bugt. The depth and gradient of\nthe seasonal thermocline between the Polar Water and\nsurface water is variable. The surface water consists of low\nsalinity meltwater from seasonal sea ice, icebergs and\nglacier melt that is considerably warmer than Polar Water\ndue to heating by solar insolation. More exposed areas\n(e.g., sites 1, 2 and 18) have a shallow and steep thermocline\nwith a thin surface water layer while the more sheltered\nlocations (e.g., sites 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) have a substantial\ntransitional zone down to 150 m with gradually decreasing\ntemperature (Fig. 3). Sites close to Jakobshavn Isfjord,\npresently the major source of icebergs and meltwater into\nDisko Bugt, have a surface meltwater cap close to 0 uC with\na very low salinity, , 30 psu (sites 21 and 23, labeled\nmeltwater, MW, on Fig. 3). The core of the Polar Water\nbelow this surface water has a relatively consistent\ntemperature and salinity signature. It represents the poorly\nmixed remnant of the EGC combined with meltwater from\nicebergs and glaciers from the western edge of the ice sheet.\nStein (1991) and Buch (1993, 2000) identified this shallow\n(0\u2013200 m) coastal remnant of the EGC flowing northwards\nat Fylla Bank off southwest Greenland. The WGC water\nbelow has a well-constrained temperature and salinity\nsignature. The transition between the WGC and the Polar\nWater is relatively sharp in the southern sites, close to the\npoint of entry of both water masses flowing into Disko\nBugt from the southwest (e.g., sites 3\u20139). The more\nnorthern and exposed locations (e.g., sites 1, 2, 14, 15, 18\nand 19) exhibit a gradual transition produced by the two\nwater masses continuing to mix as they circulate around\nDisko Bugt. Indeed, a temperature-salinity plot of basal\nconditions at each site (Fig. 4) identifies a transitional water\nmass, here termed mixed WGC water, formed by the\nmixing of WGC water with Polar Water.\nThe contrasts in water mass thickness and characteristics,\nalong with the variable bathymetry of Disko Bugt, have\nproduced sample sites with a range of bottom water\ntemperature and salinity (Fig. 4). For example, sites close\nto the mouth and to the north of Jakobshavn Isbrae tend to\nhave a thicker Polar Water layer (close to the source of cold\nand low salinity water and influenced by Coriolis de-\nR\nFIGURE 3.

The\ntemperature-salinity plot (Fig. 4) illustrates this point \u2013 the\nsample sites can be split into groups based on the basal\nwater mass characteristics. Samples have been collected\nfrom the three significant water masses identified from the\nCTD data along with the additional transitional water mass\n(mixed WGC water) identified from figure 4.\nFORAMINIFERAL ANALYSIS\nFrom the 20 samples studied, a total of 65 species of\nforaminifera were identified, 29 agglutinated and 36\ncalcareous species (see Appendix 1 for full faunal list).\nFor statistical analysis, only species with a maximum\nabundance .2% were included (Fig. 5). The number of\nspecies included in statistical analysis was reduced to 30; 17\nagglutinated and 13 calcareous species. The absolute\nabundances of foraminifera are relatively low ranging from\n100 to 400 specimens per 10 ml of sediment (Table 1). In\ngeneral, the assemblages are dominated by agglutinated\nspecies (66\u2013100% of the assemblage, Table 1). The only\nexception is sample 11, which is dominated by calcareous\nspecies (76% of the assemblage). The most common\nagglutinated species include Adercotryma glomerata, Cri-\nbrostomoides crassimargo, Reophax fusiformis, S. biformis\nand T. earlandi (illustrated in Plate 1, figs. a, d, g, j and k,\nrespectively). The most common calcareous species include\nCibicides lobatulus, Melonis barleeanum, Nonionellina lab-\nradorica and Islandiella helenae (illustrated in Plate 2, figs.\nb, i and f). The relatively low abundance of calcareous\nforaminifera may in part be due to poor preservation. Poor\npreservation of calcareous tests was noted in most samples,\nrecorded either as organic test linings, or by etched or partly\ndissolved specimens (see Plate 2, fig. k for an example of\na partly dissolved specimen). Dissolution of calcareous\nfauna is a common problem in high latitude areas,\nassociated with cold CO2-rich Polar and Arctic waters\n(e.g., Aksu, 1983; Hald and Steinsund, 1992; Jennings and\nHelgadottir, 1994). Although low numbers of calcareous\nforaminifera are found in surface samples throughout\nDisko Bugt, sufficient numbers for assemblage analysis\nand radiocarbon dating have been found in Holocene\nsediments (e.g., Lloyd and others, 2005; Lloyd, 2006).\nFaunal Assemblage Zones (FAZs)\nCluster analysis separates the samples into six distinct\nfaunal assemblage zones (FAZs; Fig. 5). Detrended corre-\nspondence analysis supports this zonation; samples from\nthe 6 cluster zones identified in figure 5 are grouped\ntogether on the DCA plot of sample scores from axis 1\nplotted against axis 2 (Fig. 6). Different symbols are used\nfor each FAZ in figure 6. The first two axes of the DCA\nexplain 47.9% of the variance in the species data. The\nsummary information from DCA is shown in Table 2. The\nspatial distribution of the six assemblage zones is shown in\nfigure 7 and the dominant characteristics of each zone are\ndescribed below.\nFAZ 1: Faunal assemblage zone 1 contains 6 samples\nand is overwhelmingly dominated by agglutinated species\n(.85%). This zone is dominated by S. biformis (15\u201345%;\nPlate 1, fig. j) and A. glomerata (20\u201338%; Plate 1, fig. a).\nOther common species include C. crassimargo (7\u201321%;\nPl. 1, fig. d), C. arctica (4\u201319%; Plate 1, fig. m), Porta-\ntrochammina bipolaris (1\u201314%; Plate 1, fig. c) and Textu-\nlaria torquata (0\u20137%; Plate 1, fig. l). Samples from this zone\nare found in relatively shallow coastal areas along the\neastern margins of Disko Island, immediately west of\nJakobshavn Isfjord and in southeastern Disko Bugt\n(Fig. 7).\nFAZ 2: Faunal assemblage zone 2, containing 4 samples,\nis dominated by agglutinated species but also has significant\nproportions of calcareous species (15\u201335%). The most\nabundant species is A. glomerata (18\u201327%), with the\ncalcareous species M. barleeanum (10\u201315%) being the\nsecond most abundant species. Other common species\ninclude P. bipolaris (4\u201310%), Saccammina difflugiformis (5\u2013\n7%, Plate 1, fig. i), R. fusiformis (3\u201310%) and variable\namounts of N. labradorica (0\u201310%). Samples from this zone\nare found in towards the center of Disko Bugt (Fig. 7).\nFAZ 3: Faunal assemblage zone 3 contains 6 samples and\nis dominated by agglutinated foraminifera (.80%). It is\ndominated by A. glomerata (16\u201335%), with T. earlandi (8\u2013\n18%; Plate 1, fig. k), R. fusiformis (6\u201316%), Reophax\npilulifer (1\u201310%, Plate 1; fig. h) and C. crassimargo (3\u2013\n13%) also common. The calcareous species M. barleeanum\nand N. labradorica are present in low abundances through\nthis zone. Samples from this zone are found in two groups,\njust south of Disko Island and in coastal and fjord areas in\nsoutheast Disko Bugt (Fig. 7).\nFAZ 4: Faunal assemblage zone 4 contains 2 samples,\nand is dominated by agglutinated specimens (85\u201395%), T.\nearlandi (48\u201355%) in particular. Other species common in\nthis zone include I. helenae (3\u20137%; Plate 2, fig. f), R. gracilis\nFIGURE 4. Temperature versus salinity biplot of basal-water\ncharacteristics from sample locations. The data can be grouped into\nfour water masses that impinge on the seafloor at the sites sampled in\nDisko Bugt.

Samples are labeled.\nFORAMINIFERA FROM DISKO BUGT, GREENLAND 319\n(1\u201318%), S. biformis (5\u20138%), and C. crassimargo (5\u20137%).\nSamples from zone 4 are found in close association with\nsamples from zone 3 in southeastern Disko Bugt (Fig. 7).\nFAZ 5: Faunal assemblage zone 5 contains 1 sample (11),\nand is the only zone that is dominated by calcareous\nspecimens (76%), predominantly C. lobatulus (46%; Plate 2,\nfig. b). This zone has a high diversity of species and contains\nminor abundances of Astrononion gallowayi (6.2%; Plate 2,\nfig. a) and Elphidium excavatum forma clavata (3.6%;\nPlate 2, figs. g, h) amongst many other species. The single\nsample from this zone comes from a shallow coastal area\nimmediately east of Disko Island (Fig. 7).\nFAZ 6: Faunal assemblage zone 6 also contains only 1\nsample (17) and is dominated by agglutinated species\n(80%). There are 4 co-dominant species in this zone;\nAmmoscalaria pseudospiralis (17.5%; Plate 1, fig. b), C.\ncrassimargo (19.3%), Eggerella advena (21.4%; Plate 1, fig. e)\nand S. biformis (19.6%). The single sample from this zone\ncomes from a shallow basin on the eastern margins of an\nisland in northeastern Disko Bugt (Fig. 7).\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAUNA AND\nENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES\nThe environmental variables measured for each sample\nare presented in Table 3. Canonical correspondence anal-\nysis was used to investigate the relationship between the\nenvironmental variables and the ecological data. The results\nof the CCA are summarized in Table 4. The sum of all\neigenvalues is the sum of the length of the maximized\nspread of species along hypothetical environmental gradi-\nents. The sum of all canonical eigenvalues is the sum of the\nmaximized spread along environmental gradients, which is\na linear combination of the measured environmental\nFIGURE 5.

By comparing these two values, it is possible\nto ascertain how well the environmental variables mea-\nsured explain the data. The environmental variables\nmeasured in this study explain 48.5% of the variance\nin foraminiferal data. A combination of CCA axes 1 and 2\nexplain 41.1% of the foraminiferal data (eigenvalues\n0.524 and 0.216, respectively; Table 4). To determine\nthe individual contribution of each environmental vari-\nable in the analysis, a series of partial CCAs were carried\nout (Borcard and others, 1992; Table 5). The percen-\ntage contribution can be calculated by comparing the\neigenvalues of the partial CCA to the sum of the\neigenvalues from the main CCA. The partial CCAs show\nthat the most significant individual contributions are made\nby bottom-water salinity and water depth (20.4% and 20%\nrespectively) with all other variables contributing , 10%\neach. This suggests that water mass characteristics are an\nimportant control on faunal distribution measured in this\nstudy.\nThe statistical significance of the relationship between the\nspecies and environmental variables identified by the CCA\nis evaluated using a Monte Carlo permutations test (Ter\nBraak and Smilauer, 2002). The test statistic (F-ratio)\nproduced by a test of significance of all canonical axes is\n1.610 and the P-value is 0.05. This indicates that the results\nof the CCA are significant at the 5% level.\nThe environmental, species and sample values generated\nby CCA for the first 2 axes are plotted in figure 8. The\nlength of the arrows approximates the relative importance\nof the environmental variables in explaining the data and\nthe direction demonstrates the approximate correlation to\nthe ordination axis, other environmental variables, species\nand samples. The correlation of environmental variables\nwith axes 1 and 2 (Fig. 8a) indicates that salinity and depth\nare negatively correlated with axis 1, sand and temperature\nare positively correlated with axis 1, clay and silt are\npositively correlated with axis 2 and nitrogen and carbon\nare negatively correlated with axis 2. On the sample\u2013\nenvironment biplot (Fig. 8b), samples plotting to the right\ntend to be from shallow, low-salinity areas (e.g., samples 11,\n17 and 12) while those to the left are from deeper more\nsaline locations. Samples plotting towards the bottom of\nFig. 8b are dominated by sandy sediments (e.g., samples 23,\n11 and 12) and those towards the top from clay- and silt-\ndominated sediments (e.g., samples 4, 5, 17 and 21). On the\nspecies - environment biplot (Fig. 8a), the position of\na species projected perpendicularly onto the environmental\narrows approximate their weighted average optima along\neach environmental variable (Fig. 8a). Species tolerances of\nparticular environmental variables can be identified from\nthis biplot.

Sediment\nsubstrate (clay and sand) is next in importance, with\nbottom-water temperature, TOC and TN less important.\nOther studies of foraminifera in high-latitude fjord and\nshelf areas have found a range of environmental variables\ninfluencing their distribution. Water mass characteristics\nare commonly identified as important variables, particu-\nlarly salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen content\n(e.g., Schafer and Cole, 1986; Osterman and Nelson, 1989,\nHunt and Corliss, 1993; Jennings and Helgadottir, 1994;\nRytter and others, 2002; Husum and Hald, 2004; Jennings\nand others, 2004). Other important factors that have also\nbeen identified include food supply and substrate texture\n(Jennings and Helgadottir, 1994; Korsun and Hald, 1998;\nHusum and Hald, 2004; Jennings and others, 2004); glacial\nproximity (Nagy, 1984; Vilks and others, 1989; Korsun and\nHald, 1998) and duration of sea-ice cover (Schro\u00a8der-Adams\nand others, 1990a, 1990b, Osterman and others, 1999).\nNot all of these variables have been measured in this\nstudy, some of the variability seen in the faunal data may be\ndue to these unmeasured variables. Variation in sea-ice\ncover is one of the variables that has not been directly\nmeasured. Observations of duration of sea-ice cover in the\nBaffin Bay and Davis Strait area show relatively rapid\nformation and break-up of sea ice in Disko Bugt\n(Environment Canada, 2002). The relatively small geo-\ngraphical range of sample locations suggests that variations\nin sea-ice cover between sites would be small, so is unlikely\nto produce major variation in assemblages between\nsamples. Schro\u00a8der-Adams and others (1990a) identified\na fauna similar to that of this study characterized by poor\ncalcareous preservation and dominance of agglutinated\nfauna (species such as S. biformis, C. crassimargo, A.\nglomerata and S. difflugiformis) from Lancaster Sound and\nBaffin Bay. They suggested the relatively long ice-free\nsummer period and subsequent increase in meltwater flux\ncompared to the Arctic Ocean influenced dissolution of the\ncalcareous fauna. A similar situation may partially explain\nthe fauna seen in Disko Bugt, large volumes of meltwater\nproduced by sea ice and glacial flux influencing preserva-\ntion and water mass characteristics. Seasonal sea-ice cover\nalmost certainly influences the fauna preserved in Disko\nBugt, but is unlikely to explain variation in fauna found\nwithin the area.\nThe possible influence of proximity to glaciers has also\nnot been directly measured in this study, but can be assessed\nqualitatively. The main influence of glaciers would be\nsupply of meltwater and sediment. The main tidewater\nglaciers in Disko Bugt that are likely to have an influence\non fauna are Jakobshavn Isbrae, Sermeq Kujatdleq and\nSermeq Avangnardleq (Fig. 2). The influence of glacier\nproximity can be seen in lower bottom-water salinity and\ntemperature close to these tidewater glaciers. This is\nparticularly apparent in sites close to Jakobshavn Isfjord\n(sites 20 and 21, FAZ 1, Fig. 7). There does not seem to be\na clear influence of glacier proximity on particle size,\nhowever. The position of glaciers in Disko Bugt may well\ninfluence the fauna, but because the major influence of\nglacier proximity is on water temperature and salinity\n(hence water-mass characteristics), it is actually taken into\naccount by CTD measurements.\nThe dominant influence of bottom-water salinity (hence\nwater-mass characteristics) on faunal distribution in Disko\nBugt is supported by the bottom-water temperature-salinity\nbiplot (Fig. 4). This highlights the dominant role salinity\nplays in characterizing water masses in Disko Bugt. The\nWGC, Polar Water and surface water are clearly differen-\ntiated based on salinity along with the transitional water\nmass (mixed WGC water). Water depth also has an\nFIGURE 6.

The samples are labeled and different\nsymbols are used for each faunal assemblage zone as identified by\ncluster analysis. The clear grouping of samples by zone supports the\nzonation produced by cluster analysis.\nTABLE 2.

Faunal assemblage zones 5 and 6 identified in\ncluster analysis and DCA are formed from single samples\nand are found within the surface water (samples 11 and 17,\nFig. 4) and are characterized by shallow water and lowest-\nsalinity values. Several of the important species in these\nzones are commonly associated with relatively shallow\nwater (see discussion below). The other four FAZs also\nshow a good correlation to water mass characteristics: FAZ\n1 incorporates all the samples from the Polar Water along\nwith two samples from the mixed WGC, FAZ 2 contains\nthe remaining three samples from the mixed WGC water\nand one sample from the WGC water, and FAZs 3 and 4\ncontain samples found exclusively within the WGC water.\nThe CCA results show substrate (particularly percent\nclay and sand) also has an influence on the Disko Bugt\nfauna. This is most clearly seen in high levels of sand from\nsample 11 (FAZ 5) differentiating this sample. FAZ 4 also\nshows relatively high levels of clay, while FAZ 1 is\ndominated by relatively high levels of sand.\nFood supply, assessed in this study through measurement\nof TOC and TN, also has an influence on faunal\nassemblage zones. The highest values for both TOC and\nTN are found in FAZ 3 (average TOC, 1.4%; TN, 0.18%).\nFIGURE 7. Spatial distribution of faunal assemblage zones in Disko Bugt identified by the cluster analysis and DCA.\nFORAMINIFERA FROM DISKO BUGT, GREENLAND 325\nFAZs 2 and 4 also have relatively high levels of TOC and\nTN compared to FAZs 1, 5 and 6. This might also be\nrelated to the water-mass characteristics. Faunal assem-\nblage zones 2, 3 and 4 with higher TOC and TN levels are\nfrom WGC waters (organic material and nutrients carried\nfrom the North Atlantic) while FAZs 1, 5 and 6 with lower\nvalues are from Polar Water and surface water (lower\norganic material and nutrients from Arctic sourced EGC\nwaters and also diluted by meltwater influx).\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORAMINIFERA AND\nENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES\nThe two samples from the surface water mass shown in\nFig. 4, samples 11 and 17, form the single sampled FAZ 5\nand FAZ 6. Faunal assemblage zone 5 (Sample 11) is\ndominated by C. lobatulus (Fig. 5). Cibicides lobatulus is\ncommonly found in relatively shallow-water, high-energy\nenvironments, and is often found associated with coarse-\ngrained sediments (e.g., Hald and Steinsund, 1992; Jennings\nand Helgadottir, 1994; Hald and Korsun, 1997; Polyak and\nothers, 2002). The two other species closely associated with\nthis zone (Figs. 5, 8a and 8b), Elphidium excavatum f.\nclavata and Astrononion gallowayi, are commonly found in\nrelatively cold, low-salinity waters, often associated with\nproximal glaciomarine conditions (Vilks, 1981; Osterman\nand Nelson, 1989; Hald and Korsun, 1997; Korsun and\nHald, 2000; Polyak and others 2002; Husum and Hald,\n2004). Low water salinity and temperature is consistent\nwith the occurrence of this assemblage zone in Disko Bugt\nin a shallow coastal location with abundant sand under the\ninfluence of low-salinity surface water (most likely influ-\nenced by meltwater from the nearby ice cap on Disko\nIsland, Fig. 7). Faunal assemblage zone 6 (Sample 17) is\ncharacterized by relatively high abundances of two species\nrare in all others samples \u2013 E. advena and A. pseudospiralis\n(Fig. 5). These species are commonly found in relatively\nshallow waters, e.g., Vilks and Deonarine (1988) report E.\nadvena common in water depths of 50\u201360 m, and are clearly\nassociated with shallow waters in Disko Bugt. The\nrelatively high abundance of S. biformis in FAZ 6 attests\nto the relatively low-salinity nature of the surface water in\nthis area.\nFaunal assemblage zone 1 contains all of the samples\nfound under the influence of the Polar Water mass (Fig. 4)\nalong with two samples from the mixed WGC water mass\n(samples 14 and 15). Notably, these samples are dominated\nby S. biformis with C. arctica also common. Korsun and\nHald (2000) find S. biformis in a glaciomarine environment\nfrom a Svarlbard glacial fed fjord; it is one of the first\narenaceaous species to appear moving away from the\nglacier (along with T. earlandi). Schafer and Cole (1986)\nfound C. arctica (called Reophax arctica) in fjords of\neastern Baffin Island influenced by cold arctic waters. The\nabundance of these species in FAZ1, characterized by\nrelatively cold and low-salinity waters, is in agreement with\nprevious studies where these species are common in high-\nlatitude locations under the influence of cold arctic waters\nand also in glaciomarine conditions (e.g., Vilks, 1964;\nSchafer and Cole, 1986; Madsen and Knudsen, 1994;\nJennings and Helgadottir, 1994; Hald and Korsun, 1997;\nKorsun and Hald, 1998; Korsun and Hald, 2000).\nHowever, the relatively high abundance of A. glomerata\nin this zone, a species often found associated with\n\u2018\u2018Atlantic\u2019\u2019 sourced waters in high latitudes (e.g., Hald\nand Korsun, 1997), highlights the influence of Atlantic\nTABLE 3.

This is not surprising given\nthe dominance of the WGC on the present day circulation\nsystem in Disko Bugt. It is likely to be the result of partial\nmixing of the warmer IC component of the WGC with the\nrelatively cold EGC component that forms the Polar Water\nmass in Disko Bugt (identified from the CTD data, Figs. 3\nand 4).\nFaunal assemblage zone 2 contains the three other\nsamples found within the influence of mixed WGC waters\nalong with sample 18 influenced by the main body of the\nWGC. These samples, and also the samples from FAZ 3 (all\nsamples within the WGC field, Fig. 4), are dominated by A.\nglomerata, but also have significant abundances of S.\ndifflugiformis, R. pilulifer and R. fusiformis. All these species\nare common in high-latitude areas influenced by Atlantic-\nsourced waters with relatively high salinity (Vilks, 1980;\nBilodeau and others, 1994; Jennings and Helgadottir, 1994;\nHald and Korsun, 1997). The calcareous species M.\nbarleeanum and N. labradorica are also common in FAZs\n2 and 3, both species are closely linked to the availability of\norganic matter (e.g., Wollenberg and Mackensen, 1998;\nRytter and others, 2002; Jennings and others, 2004).\nMelonis barleeanum is an infaunal species that feeds on\nburied organic matter (Corliss, 1985, 1991) while N.\nlabradorica is common in areas of high productivity (Polyak\nand others, 2002) and areas with fresh phytodetritus (Hald\nand Steinsund, 1992). Both species are associated with the\nhighest levels of TOC and TN in the Disko Bugt samples.\nTheir abundance here is to a large extent controlled by\navailability of organic material, but this is influenced in\nDisko Bugt by the distribution of water masses. Higher\nTOC levels and TN are associated with a stronger influx of\nAtlantic-sourced WGC waters. This linked association with\norganic matter and Atlantic-sourced waters has been seen\nin Baffin Island fjords (Schafer and Cole, 1986), east\nGreenland fjords and shelf (Jennings and Helgadottir,\n1994), Svalbard fjords (Hald and Korsun, 1997), and the\nnorth Icelandic shelf (Jennings and others, 2004). The\noccurrence of C. arctica and P. bipolaris in moderate\nabundances in FAZ 2 suggests the influence of the slightly\ncolder, less-saline Polar Water on these samples (supported\nby the grouping of most of these samples in the mixed\nWGC field of Fig. 4). Vilks (1989) and Jennings and\nHelgadottir (1994) found P. bipolaris under polar waters in\nthe Canadian Arctic and fjords of eastern Greenland,\nrespectively.\nSamples from FAZ 3 and FAZ 4 are all found in areas\nwithin the influence of the WGC. In general, samples from\nFAZ 3 have a higher proportion of species commonly\nfound under the influence of Atlantic-sourced water\ncompared to the other samples from Disko Bugt (e.g., A.\nglomerata, S. difflugiformis, R. pilulifer and R. fusiformis).\nFaunal assemblage zone 4 has a rather different fauna\ndominated by T. earlandi with a much lower abundance of\nA. glomerata. Many studies from high latitudes find T.\nearlandi associated with S. biformis and common in areas\ninfluenced by relatively cold, low-salinity Arctic water and\noften in glaciomarine environments (e.g., Schafer and Cole,\n1986; Jennings and Helgadottir, 1994; Madsen and\nKnudsen, 1994; Korsun and Hald, 2000). In Disko Bugt,\nthese two species have slightly differing ecological prefer-\nences. Spiroplectammina biformis is dominant under the\ninfluence of colder less-saline bottom water, while T.\nearlandi has a higher abundance in areas with a stronger\nAtlantic water influence (FAZs 3 and 4). Textularia earlandi\ndominates FAZ 4. Samples from this zone have an average\nbottom water temperature of 3.3uC and salinity of 34.3 psu\nwhile S. biformis dominates FAZ 1 with lower average\nbottom-water temperature and salinity values of 2.1 uC and\n33.9 psu, respectively. However, a stronger control on the\ndistribution of T. earlandi appears to be substrate rather\nthan water-mass characteristics with a strong affinity for\nfine grained sediments. Faunal assemblage zone 4 has the\nhighest average clay composition (54%). Faunal assemblage\nzone 3 also has moderately high abundances of T. earlandi,\nand the second highest average clay composition (43.4%).\nThis interpretation is supported by the CCA results. T.\nearlandi plots very close to the clay arrow in figure 8a,\nFIGURE 8. Canonical-correspondence-analysis biplots of (a) fora-\nminiferal species \u2013 environment and (b) sample \u2013 environment. Only\nspecies with abundance .2% are included. For species abbreviations\nsee Fig. 5. The relative length of arrows represents the importance of\nindividual environmental variables and the direction represents their\ncorrelation with the CCA axes 1 and 2.\nFORAMINIFERA FROM DISKO BUGT, GREENLAND 327\nsuggesting clay is an important environmental variable\ncontrolling the distribution of this species.\nMost of the samples from Disko Bugt have relatively\nhigh abundances of A. glomerata (the exception being the\nvery shallow samples 11 and 17). This species is widespread\non continental shelf areas of high latitudes, and is\ncommonly found associated with Atlantic-sourced waters\n(sometimes described as \u2018\u2018transformed\u2019\u2019 Atlantic water, e.g.,\nHald and Korsun, 1997). The abundance of this species,\nalong with the relatively low abundance of cold glaciomar-\nine species such as E. excavatum forma clavata and the near\nabsence of the common Polar Water species Cassidulina\nreniforme, in the present day samples from Disko Bugt\nsuggests Atlantic-sourced waters (from the IC) have an\ninfluence throughout Disko Bugt, even within the water\nmass defined here as Polar Water. The only exception to\nthis is within the shallow surface waters dominated by low-\nsalinity glacial meltwater. The abundance of C. reniforme\nmay also be lower than expected due to greater dissolution\nthan other calcareous species due to the relatively small size\nand thin wall of this species.\nThe faunal data presented here show that agglutinated\nforaminifera are very important discriminators of environ-\nmental conditions in Disko Bugt. Past studies of fossil\nmaterial collected from high latitudes often focus on the\ncalcareous faunal component due to poor preservation of\nagglutinated taxa (e.g., Elverh\u00f8i and others, 1980; Bennike\nand others, 1994; Vosgerau and others, 1994). However, the\nimportance of agglutinated foraminifera in paleoenviron-\nmental reconstruction is highlighted by recent studies of\nHolocene sediments collected from Disko Bugt (e.g., Lloyd\nand others, 2005; Lloyd, 2006). Fossil material collected\nfrom Disko Bugt tends to have good preservation of\nagglutinated fauna and rather variable preservation of\ncalcareous fauna. Indeed, Jennings and Helgadottir (1994)\ndiscuss the differential preservation of agglutinated versus\ncalcareous foraminifera in different water masses in high\nlatitudes, highlighting the importance of including the\nagglutinated fauna in studies from high-latitude continental\nshelves.\nThe data presented here suggest that foraminifera are\na suitable proxy to identify changes in water-mass\ncharacteristics in the Disko Bugt area from recently\ncollected gravity and piston cores (e.g., Lloyd and others,\n2005; Lloyd, 2006). In particular there is a clear differen-\ntiation between a fauna indicative of relatively saline and\nwarm WGC waters and a fauna indicative of relatively\nlower-salinity and colder meltwater or Polar Water. It is,\ntherefore, possible to reconstruct changes in the strength of\nthe WGC, and also the relative contribution of the EGC\nand IC components of the WGC through identification of\nchanges in relative bottom water salinity conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on the analysis of 20 samples from Disko Bugt on\nthe west Greenland margin the following conclusions can be\nmade:\n1. A wide range of both agglutinated and calcareous\nforaminiferal species are found throughout Disko\nBugt at the present day, but the fauna is dominated\nby agglutinated species. Cluster analysis and DCA\nidentify 6 faunal assemblage zones.\n2. The relationship between environmental variables and\nforaminifera was investigated using CCA. The envi-\nronmental variables measured in this study explain\n48.5% of the variance in foraminiferal data. The most\nimportant variables are bottom-water salinity and\nwater depth, explaining 20.4% and 20% of the\nexplained variance in foraminiferal data, respectively.\n3. Based on the CCA, foraminifera in Disko Bugt appear\nto be controlled most strongly by water mass\ncharacteristics at the sea floor. Shallow water environ-\nments within the relatively warm, low-salinity surface\nwater are dominated by C. lobatulus in areas of coarse\nsediment and a mixed assemblage with high abun-\ndances of A. pseudospiralis and E. advena in finer-\ngrained sediments. Sites influenced by the colder, low-\nsalinity Polar Water (the poorly mixed East Greenland\nCurrent component of the West Greenland Current)\nare dominated by S. biformis, with A. glomerata and C.\narctica also common. Sites influenced by the warmer,\nmore-saline West Greenland Current water mass are\ndominated by A. glomerata, with high abundances of\nR. fusiformis, R. pilulifer and T. earlandi (the dominant\nspecies in finer grained sediments). The mixed West\nGreenland Current water mass identified from the\nCTD data, forming a transition between Polar Water\nand WGC water, is less well-defined by foraminiferal\ndata, but is dominated by A. glomerata, with moderate\nand variable abundances of M. barleeanum, P.\nbipolaris, C. arctica and S. biformis.\n4. This modern faunal dataset provides a basis for\nreconstructing changes in the oceanography, in par-\nticular the relative strength of the WGC (and the\nrelative proportion of the EGC component of the\nWGC) from a series of gravity cores and piston cores\ncollected from Disko Bugt.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis research was completed as part of a NERC\nARCICE (Arctic Ice and Environmental Variability)\nthematic grant (Grant No. GST022189), \u2018\u2018Late Quaternary\nIce Sheet Dynamics in West Greenland.\u2019\u2019 I would like to\nthank the Board of the Arctic Station, University of\nCopenhagen, for the excellent logistical support provided\nby the skipper and crew of the MV Porsild and the Arctic\nResearch Station, Qeqertarsuaq.
