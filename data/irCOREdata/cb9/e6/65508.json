Stewart and Yonghong Xiang\nAbstract\u2014In this paper, we give precise solutions to problems posed by Wang et al. and by Hsieh et al. In particular, we show that Qkn\nis bipanconnected and edge-bipancyclic, when k \u0002 3 and n \u0002 2, and we also show that when k is odd, Qkn is m-panconnected, for\nm \u00bc n\u00f0k\u00031\u00de\u00fe2k\u000362 , and \u00f0k\u0003 1\u00de-pancyclic (these bounds are optimal). We introduce a path-shortening technique, called progressive\nshortening, and strengthen existing results, showing that when paths are formed using progressive shortening, then these paths can\nbe efficiently constructed and used to solve a problem relating to the distributed simulation of linear arrays and cycles in a parallel\nmachine whose interconnection network is Qkn, even in the presence of a faulty processor.\nIndex Terms\u2014Interconnection networks, k-ary n-cubes, bipanconnectivity, bipancyclicity.\n\u00c7\n1 INTRODUCTION\nTHE choice of interconnection network is crucial in thedesign of a distributed-memory multiprocessor. As to\nwhich network is chosen depends upon a number of\nfactors relating to the topological, algorithmic, and com-\nmunication properties of the network and the types of\nproblems to which the resulting computer is to be applied.\nOne of the most popular interconnection networks is\nundoubtedly the n-dimensional hypercube Qn. Some of its\npleasing properties, with regard to parallel computation,\ninclude the following: it is vertex- and edge-symmetric; it\nis Hamiltonian; it has diameter n; it has a recursive\ndecomposition; and it contains, or \u201cnearly\u201d contains (as\nsubgraphs), almost all interconnection networks currently\nvogue in parallel computing (see [18] for these results and\nmore on the hypercube). Some of the commercial\nmachines whose underlying topology is based on the\nhypercube are the Cosmic Cube [23], the Ametek S\/14 [2],\nthe iPSC [10], [11], the Ncube [7], [11], and the CM-200 [8].\nHowever, every vertex of Qn has degree n, and,\nconsequently, as n increases so does the degree of every\nvertex. High degree vertices in interconnection networks\ncan lead to technological problems in parallel computers\nwhose underlying topology is that of the said interconnec-\ntion network. One method of circumventing this problem,\nso as to still retain a \u201chypercube-like\u201d interconnection\nnetwork, is to build parallel computers so that the under-\nlying topology is the k-ary n-cube Qkn. The k-ary n-cube Q\nk\nn\nis similar in essence to the hypercube, but by a judicious\nchoice of k and n, we can include a large number of\nvertices yet keep the degree of each vertex fixed. For\nexample, the hypercube Q12 has 4,096 vertices and every\nvertex has degree 12. However, Q163 has 4,096 vertices and\nevery vertex has degree 6. Of course, one usually loses out\nin some other respect (for example, in terms of diameter),\nbut often, this loss is not too catastrophic. The k-ary n-cube\nQkn has not been investigated to the same extent as the\nhypercube, but it is known to have the following properties\n(among many others): it is vertex- and edge-symmetric [3];\nit is Hamiltonian [4], [6]; it has diameter nbk=2c [4], [6]; it\nhas a recursive decomposition; and it contains many\nimportant interconnection networks such as cycles (of\ncertain lengths) [3], meshes (of certain dimensions) [4],\nand even hypercubes (of certain dimensions) [6]. Machines\nwhose underlying topology is based on a k-ary n-cube\ninclude the Mosaic [24], the iWARP [5], the J-machine [21],\nthe Cray T3D [16], and the Cray T3E [1].\nOf interest to us in this paper are the different paths and\ncycles embedded within k-ary n-cubes. Path and cycle\nnetworks are fundamental in parallel computing; not only is\nthere a multitude of algorithms specifically designed for\nlinear arrays of processors and cycles of processors but also\npaths and cycles appear as data structures in many more\nalgorithms for parallel machines whose processors are\ninterconnected in a variety of topologies. For example,\nhaving a collection of processors connected in a cycle means\nthat all-to-all message passing can be undertaken by \u201cdaisy-\nchaining\u201d messages around the cycle. Of particular interest\nto us are questions relating to Hamiltonicity, pancyclicity,\npanconnectivity, bipancyclicity, and bipanconnectivity\n(these concepts are defined in the next section). These\nproperties can be described as \u201cstrong Hamiltonicity\u201d\nproperties and their existence in an interconnection net-\nwork enables a much higher degree of flexibility with\nregard to the simulation of linear arrays of processors or\ncycles of processors.\nThe notions in the preceding paragraph have been\ninvestigated in the context of a number of interconnection\nnetworks: for example, in crossed cubes [12], [31], Mo\u00a8bius\ncubes [14], augmented cubes [20], alternating group\ngraphs [9], star graphs [29], bubble-sort graphs [17], and\nin hypercubes and hypercube-like networks [13], [19],\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 20, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009 25\n.

In\nparticular, it was proven in [27] that Qk2 is almost-\nHamiltonian connected, bipanconnected, and bipancyclic;\nthat Qkn is almost-Hamiltonian connected, for any k; and\nthat Qkn is Hamiltonian-connected, for odd k. Recently, it\nhas been proven in [15] that Q3n is edge-pancyclic. It was\nposed as an open problem in [27] as to whether their\nresults on bipanconnectivity and bipancyclicity for Qk2\ncould be extended to Qkn, for arbitrary n, and it was\nposed as an open problem in [15] as to whether their\nresults on panconnectivity and pancyclicity could be\nextended to Qkn, for arbitrary k. In this paper, we provide\nprecise answers to both these questions. In addition, we\nshow that when k is odd, Qkn is m-panconnected, for\nm \u00bc n\u00f0k\u00031\u00de\u00fe2k\u000362 , and \u00f0k\u0003 1\u00de-pancyclic (these bounds are\noptimal). We also strengthen the results in [15] and [27]\nby introducing a path-shortening technique, called pro-\ngressive shortening, and show that the construction of\npaths using this technique enables us to efficiently\nconstruct paths in a distributed fashion and so solve a\nproblem relating to the distributed simulation of linear\narrays and cycles in a parallel machine whose inter-\nconnection network is Qkn, even in the presence of a faulty\nprocessor (even in Qk2, the solution to this problem is not\npossible using the paths constructed in [27]).\nIn the next section, we present some basic definitions and\nresults, before improving the constructions from [27] in Qk2\nin Section 3. In Section 4, we look at the general case when k\nis even, and in Section 5 when k is odd. We outline our\napplication in Section 6 before presenting our conclusions in\nSection 7.\n2 BASIC DEFINITIONS AND RESULTS\nThe k-ary n-cube Qkn, for k \u0002 3 and n \u0002 2, has vertex set\nf0; 1; . . . ; k\u0003 1gn, and there is an edge \u00f0\u00f0un\u00031; un\u00032; . . . ; u0\u00de;\n\u00f0vn\u00031; vn\u00032; . . . ; v0\u00de\u00de if, and only if, there exists d 2\nf0; 1; . . . ; n\u0003 1g such that minfjud \u0003 vdj; k\u0003 jud \u0003 vdjg \u00bc 1,\nand ui \u00bc vi, for every i 2 f0; 1; . . . ; n\u0003 1g n fdg. Many\nstructural properties of k-ary n-cubes are known, but of\nparticular relevance for us is that a k-ary n-cube is vertex-\nsymmetric; that is, given any two distinct vertices v and v0 of\nQkn, there is an automorphism of Q\nk\nn mapping v to v\n0.\nThroughout, we assume that addition on tuple elements is\nmodulo k. The parity of a vertex \u00f0vn\u00031; vn\u00032; . . . ; v0\u00de of Qkn is\ndefined to be \u00f0\u0002n\u00031i\u00bc0 vi mod 2\u00de (note that if k is even, then\nevery edge of Qkn joins an even parity vertex to an odd\nparity vertex).\nAn index d 2 f0; 1; . . . ; n\u0003 1g is often referred to as a\ndimension. We can partition Qkn over dimension d by fixing\nthe dth element of any vertex tuple at some value a, for\nevery a 2 f0; 1; . . . ; k\u0003 1g. This results in k copies\nQd\u00f00\u00de; Qd\u00f01\u00de; . . . ; Qd\u00f0k\u0003 1\u00de of Qkn\u00031 (with Qd\u00f0a\u00de obtained\nto fixing the dth element at a), with corresponding\nvertices in Qd\u00f00\u00de; Qd\u00f01\u00de; . . . ; Qd\u00f0k\u0003 1\u00de joined in a cycle of\nlength k (in dimension d). Such a partition proves to be\nextremely useful.\nIt has long been known that every k-ary n-cube Qkn is\nHamiltonian, i.e., it contains a cycle passing through every\nvertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian path in a graph is a path\njoining two vertices on which every vertex of the graph\nappears exactly once, and a graph is Hamiltonian-connected if\nthere is a Hamiltonian path joining any pair of distinct\nvertices. Note that any (nontrivial) bipartite graph cannot be\nHamiltonian-connected, though there might exist almost-\nHamiltonian paths, i.e., paths joining pairs of distinct vertices\nupon which all but one of the vertices of the graph appear; a\nsolitary vertex not appearing on an almost-Hamiltonian\npath is called the residual vertex. Irrespective of whether a\ngraph is bipartite or not, we say that a graph is almost-\nHamiltonian-connected if there is a Hamiltonian path or an\nalmost-Hamiltonian path joining any pair of distinct\nvertices. It is proven in [27] that every k-ary n-cube Qkn is\nalmost-Hamiltonian-connected, and that if k is odd then Qkn\nis Hamiltonian-connected.\nWe say that a graph G on n vertices is pancyclic\n(respectively, m-pancyclic) if it contains a cycle of every\npossible length between 3 and n (respectively, m and n).\nThe graph G is almost-pancyclic if it contains a cycle of every\npossible length between 4 and n, and bipancyclic if it\ncontains a cycle of every possible even length between 4\nand n (the definition of bipancyclicity is intended primarily\nfor bipartite graphs but can be applied to any graph). A\ngraph G is edge-bipancyclic if every edge e of G lies on a cycle\nof every even length between 4 and n. The graph G is\npanconnected (respectively, m-panconnected) if for any pair of\ndistinct vertices u and v, there is a path joining u and v of\nevery length between d\u00f0u; v\u00de (respectively, m > d\u00f0u; v\u00de) and\nn\u0003 1, where d\u00f0u; v\u00de is the length of a minimal length path in\nG joining u and v. The graph G is bipanconnected if for any\npair of distinct vertices u and v, there is a path joining u\nand v of every length from {l : l \u00bc d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe 2i, where\n0 \u0004 i \u0004 n\u0003d\u00f0u;v\u00de2 }. It is proven in [27] that Qk2 is bipancon-\nnected and (edge-) bipancyclic; however, as to whether Qkn,\nfor n \u0002 3, is bipanconnected or bipancyclic was left as an\nopen question. However, in relation to this question, it was\nproven in [15] that Q3n is edge-pancyclic, for all n \u0002 2.\nOur final definition concerns the alteration of paths\njoining two distinct vertices in Qkn. Let u and v be distinct\nvertices of Qkn, and let \u0002 be a path joining u to v of length m,\nwhere m\u0003 d\u00f0u; v\u00de is even. Suppose that there are paths\n\u0002d\u00f0u;v\u00de; \u0002d\u00f0u;v\u00de\u00fe2; . . . ; \u0002m \u00bc \u0002 such that\n. the path \u0002i joins u and v and is of length i, for each\ni \u00bc d\u00f0u; v\u00de; d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe 2; . . . ;m;\n. for each i \u00bc d\u00f0u; v\u00de; d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe 2; . . . ;m\u0003 1, the path\n\u0002i\u00fe1 is of the form\nu \u00bc u0; u1; . . . ; ui\u00fe1 \u00bc v\nwith \u0002i of the form\nu \u00bc u0; u1; . . . ; uj; uj\u00fe3; uj\u00fe4; . . . ; ui\u00fe1 \u00bc v;\nfor some j 2 f0; 1; . . . ; i\u0003 2g.\nThen, we say that \u0002 can be progressively shortened to obtain\npaths of all lengths from fl : l \u00bc d\u00f0u; v\u00de; d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe 2; . . . ;mg.\nAs we shall see, it will be crucial that our paths can be\nprogressively shortened.\n26 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 20, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.

Restrictions apply.\n3 EXISTING BIPANCONNECTIVITY RESULTS\nThe result from [27] that Qk2 is bipanconnected (irrespective\nof whether k is odd or even) is important to our forth-\ncoming results (as the base case of inductions). However,\nwe need to refine the proof from [27] that Qk2 is\nbipanconnected in order to obtain a stronger result,\ninvolving progressive shortening, and so that we can apply\nthis stronger result later. We remark that it is also crucial\nthat any residual vertex is as stated in Proposition 1. Our\nstronger result is as follows:\nProposition 1. Let k \u0002 3 and let u and v be distinct vertices\nof Qk2:\n1. If k\u00fe d\u00f0u; v\u00de is odd, then there exists a Hamiltonian\npath joining u and v such that this path can be\nprogressively shortened to obtain paths of all lengths\nfrom fd\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe 2i : 0 \u0004 i \u0004 \u00f0k2\u00031\u0003d\u00f0u;v\u00de\u00de2 g.\n2. If k\u00fe d\u00f0u; v\u00de is even, then there exists an almost-\nHamiltonian path joining u and v such that the\nresidual vertex is adjacent to v and such that this path\ncan be progressively shortened to obtain paths of all\nlengths from fd\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe 2i : 0 \u0004 i \u0004 \u00f0k2\u00032\u0003d\u00f0u;v\u00de\u00de2 g.\nIn particular, Qk2 is bipannconnected.\nBefore we prove Proposition 1, let us illustrate why the\nproof from [27] that Qk2 is panconnected will not suffice.\nConsider Case (a) of [27, Fig. 2] (in this case, k is even).\nWe have reproduced this figure in Fig. 1a. The authors\nclaim (in a statement prior to Theorem 3) that the almost-\nHamiltonian path joining u and v can be shortened to\na path of length d\u00f0u; v\u00de so that paths of lengths\nd\u00f0u; v\u00de; d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe 2; . . . ; k2 \u0003 2 are obtained, and this is\nindeed the case. However, regard the path from u to v\nas a curve on the plane and close this curve as shown in\nFig. 1 with the dotted line. No matter how we progres-\nsively shorten the almost-Hamiltonian path, the residual\nvertex (shaded in gray) must lie inside the closed curve,\nand hence, we cannot shorten the almost-Hamiltonian\npath to a path of length d\u00f0u; v\u00de (as any such path must lie\nwithin the top-left shaded grid). We have corrected this\ndeficiency in Fig. 1b.\nSimilarly, the cases in [27, Figs. 2c and 3d] are\ndeficient in the same way and have been reproduced in\nFigs. 2a and 2c. These deficiencies are corrected in\nFigs. 2b and 2d. Thus, Proposition 1 follows (as all other\ncases in [27] are such that the paths can be progressively\nshortened).\n4 THE GENERAL CASE WHEN k IS EVEN\nWe begin by examining whether Qkn is bipanconnected or\nnot when k is even (we reiterate that Qkn is bipartite when k\nis even). As remarked earlier, this question was posed as an\nopen problem by Wang et al. in [27]. We answer this\nquestion precisely.\nTheorem 2. Let k \u0002 4 and n \u0002 2, with k even, and let u and v be\ndistinct vertices of Qkn.\n1. If d\u00f0u; v\u00de is odd, then there exists a Hamiltonian path\njoining u and v such that this path can be progressively\nshortened to obtain paths of all odd lengths between\nd\u00f0u; v\u00de and kn \u0003 1, inclusive.\n2. If d\u00f0u; v\u00de is even, then there exists an almost-Hamilto-\nnian path joining u and v such that the residual vertex is\nadjacent to v and such that this path can be progressively\nshortened to obtain paths of all even lengths between\nd\u00f0u; v\u00de and kn \u0003 2, inclusive.\nIn particular, Qkn is bipannconnected.\nProof. The vertex-symmetry of Qkn means that, w.l.o.g., we\nmay suppose that u \u00bc \u00f00; 0; . . . ; 0\u00de and v \u00bc \u00f0vn\u00031; vn\u00032;\nvn\u00033; . . . ; v0\u00de, where vi \u0004 k2 , for i \u00bc 0; 1; . . . ; n\u0003 1, and\nwhere v 6\u00bc \u00f0vn\u00031; 0; . . . ; 0\u00de. For brevity, denote vn\u00031 as a.\nLet ui \u00bc \u00f0i; 0; 0; . . . ; 0\u00de, for 0 \u0004 i \u0004 k\u0003 1; hence, u \u00bc u0\nand v 6\u00bc ua. Partition Qkn over dimension n\u0003 1 to obtain\nQkn\u00f00\u00de; Qkn\u00f01\u00de; . . . ; Qkn\u00f0k\u0003 1\u00de. We proceed by induction on\nn. There are two cases: d\u00f0ua; v\u00de is odd and d\u00f0ua; v\u00de is even.\nCase 1. d\u00f0ua; v\u00de is odd.\nSo, by the induction hypothesis applied to Qkn\u00f0a\u00de,\nthere exists a Hamiltonian path \u0002a from u\na to v in\nSTEWART AND XIANG: BIPANCONNECTIVITY AND BIPANCYCLICITY IN k-ARY n-CUBES 27\nFig. 1.

Note that\ncorresponding vertices of the paths \u00020; \u00021; . . . ; \u0002k\u00031 induce\ncycles of length k in Qkn, e.g., u\n0; u1; . . . ; uk\u00031; u0 is a cycle\nof length k, as is v0; v1; . . . ; vk\u00031; v0. In particular, the\nedges of these induced cycles and the edges of the paths\n\u00020; \u00021; . . . ; \u0002k\u00031 yield a k\u0005 kn\u00031 grid, with rows 1; 2; . . . ; k\nand columns 1; 2; . . . ;m, where m \u00bc kn\u00031, with \u201cwrap-\naround\u201d column edges.

As was the case in Case 1,\ncorresponding vertices of the paths \u00020; \u00021; . . . ; \u0002k\u00031\ninduce cycles of length k in Qkn. In particular, the\nedges of these induced cycles and the edges of the\npaths \u00020; \u00021; . . . ; \u0002k\u00031 yield a k\u0005 \u00f0kn\u00031 \u0003 1\u00de grid, with\nrows 1; 2; . . . ; k and columns 1; 2; . . . ;m\u0003 1, where\nm \u00bc kn\u00031, with \u201cwrap-around\u201d column edges.

Let k \u0002 3 and n \u0002 2, with k odd, and let u and v be\ndistinct vertices of Qkn.\n1. If d\u00f0u; v\u00de is even, then there exists a Hamiltonian path\njoining u and v such that this path can be progressively\nshortened to obtain paths of all even lengths between\nd\u00f0u; v\u00de and kn \u0003 1, inclusive.\n2.

The proof is very similar in structure to that of\nTheorem2, andweadopt the exact samenotation as in that\nproof. Again, we proceed by induction on n, and there are\ntwo cases, according to whether d\u00f0ua; v\u00de is odd or even.\nCase 1. d\u00f0ua; v\u00de is even.\nSo, by the induction hypothesis, there exists a Hamilto-\nnian path \u0002a from u\na to v in Qkn\u00f0a\u00de, which can be\nprogressively shortened to obtain paths of all even lengths\nbetween d\u00f0ua; v\u00de \u00bc d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u0003 a and kn\u00031 \u0003 1, inclusive.

Let k \u0002 3 and n \u0002 2, with k odd. Qkn is\nedge-bipancyclic.\nAs remarked earlier, bipanconnectivity and bipancycli-\ncity are concepts which make most sense in the context of\nbipartite graphs, such as the graphs Qkn, for k even.\nHowever, when k is odd, Qkn is not bipartite, and it is\npossible that odd cycles might exist, as well as odd and\neven length paths between vertices u and v. As we shall see,\nthis is indeed the case but not universally.\nHenceforth, k is odd.

Such a path must alternate\nbetween odd parity and even parity vertices; thus, such\npaths are either all of even length or all of odd length\n(depending upon whether d\u00f0u; v\u00de is even or odd). Suppose\nthat d\u00f0u; v\u00de is odd (and so all such paths are of odd\nlength). Let i be such that vi is maximal from among\nfvn\u00031; vn\u00032; . . . ; v0g.

Consequently, there are no even length paths from u\nto v of length less than d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe k\u0003 2vi. Identical reasoning\nimplies that if d\u00f0u; v\u00de is even, then there are no odd length\npaths from u to v of length less than d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe k\u0003 2vi.\nConsequently, we have a lower bound on the length of a\nshortest path, joining u and v and of parity different from\nthat of d\u00f0u; v\u00de.\nChoose the vertex v of Qkn to be such that vn\u00031 \u00bc 1 and\nvj \u00bc 0, for j \u00bc 0; 1; . . . ; n\u0003 2. Thus, there exists a vertex v\nsuch that d\u00f0u; v\u00de is odd and there are no paths joining u and\nv of even length less than d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe k\u0003 2. There clearly also\nexists a vertex v0 such that d\u00f0u; v0\u00de is even and there are no\npaths joining u and v0 of odd length less than d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe k\u0003 2.\nConsequently, as we are interested in general statements\nconcerning all pairs of distinct vertices from Qkn, we shall\nonly look for even (respectively, odd) length paths joining u\nand v of length at least d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe k\u0003 2, when d\u00f0u; v\u00de is odd\n(respectively, even).\nTheorem 6. Let k \u0002 3 and n \u0002 2, with k odd, and let u and v be\ndistinct vertices of Qkn. There are paths joining u and v of all\nlengths in fi : d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe k\u0003 3 \u0004 i \u0004 kn \u0003 1g. Furthermore,\nthis result is optimal in that there exist distinct vertices u and\nv of Qkn for which d\u00f0u; v\u00de is odd (respectively, even) and there\nare no even-length (respectively, odd-length) paths joining u\nand v of length less than d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe k\u0003 2.\nProof. The proof is very similar in structure to that of\nTheorem 4, and we adopt the exact same notation as in\nthat proof (and in the proof of Theorem 2).

We can easily lengthen this path to\nobtain a path of length d\u00f0u; v\u00de \u00fe k\u0003 2 joining any distinct\nvertices u and v. Hence, no matter which vertex v is,\nTheorem 4 yields paths as in the statement of the result.\nOptimality follows by the argument presented prior to\nthe statement of the result. tu\nNote that putting k \u00bc 3 in Theorem 6 yields the result\nfrom [15] that Q3n is edge-pancyclic, and also resolves the\nquestion for arbitrary k, as was posed in [15]. The\nfollowing corollary is immediate, given the fact that the\ndiameter of Qkn, when k is odd, is\nn\u00f0k\u00031\u00de\n2 .\nCorollary 7. Let k \u0002 3 and n \u0002 2, with k odd. The k-ary n-\ncube Qkn is m-panconnected, for m \u00bc n\u00f0k\u00031\u00de\u00fe2k\u000362 , and\n\u00f0k\u0003 1\u00de-pancyclic.\nAs remarked earlier, the bounds in Corollary 7 are optimal.\n6 AN APPLICATION\nWe give here the outline of an application where we require\nour paths to be progressively shortened and where\nalternative shortening methods will not suffice.\nConsider a parallel machine whose underlying inter-\nconnection network is a k-ary n-cube, and where this\nmachine is required to solve problems specifically designed\nfor a cycle of processors (among other problems), with the\nnumber of processors involved in the cycle being variable.\nMoreover, there is known to be a faulty processor in the\nmachine, and this faulty processor cannot be used in any\nembedded cycle. Furthermore, the location of the fault is\nnot known and any cycle must be constructed in a\ndistributed fashion, through message-passing between\nprocessors.\nFor simplicity, suppose that k is even and n \u00bc 2;\nconsequently, any cycle we construct must have even\nlength. We begin our construction by processor (0, 0)\nattempting to construct a Hamiltonian path to processor\n(0, 1) according to the construction in Proposition 1.\nActually, the path is constructed as in Case 1.3 of [27,\nTheorem 1]. It is important to note that the constructions\nin Proposition 1 (and [27, Theorems 1 and 3]) are of such\na uniform nature that the processor at the head of the\npath constructed so far can calculate in constant time the\nname of the next processor on the path, and can send a\nmessage to this processor, thus extending the path\nconstructed so far. If there were no faults, then this\nconstruction would terminate with a Hamiltonian path\nfrom (0, 0) to (0, 1) laid out in the k-ary 2-cube. However,\nthe construction will halt when the faulty processor is\nencountered (we assume that the processor immediately\nbefore the fault on the constructed path can detect that\nthe next processor is faulty).\nLet p be the processor that detects that the faulty\nprocessor is the next processor on the path, and suppose\nthat this faulty processor is f \u00bc \u00f0i; j\u00de. The processor p sends\na message to processor s \u00bc \u00f0i\u00fe 1; j\u00de (over at most four hops,\nwith addition modulo k) that it should use the construction\nof Proposition 1 to embark on the construction of a path of\nlength k2 \u0003 2 to the processor \u00f0i; j\u0003 1\u00de. Note that the path,\nas shown in Fig. 2b (that is, the amended construction of a\ncase from [27]), avoids the faulty processor f . We reiterate\nthat the uniform nature of the construction is such that the\nprocessor at the head of the path constructed so far can\ncalculate in constant time the name of the next processor on\nthe path, and can send a message to this processor, thus\nextending the path constructed so far. Having reached the\nprocessor \u00f0i; j\u0003 1\u00de, we actually truncate the path at\nprocessor t \u00bc \u00f0i\u00fe 1; j\u0003 1\u00de. Thus, we have a path of length\nk2 \u0003 3 from processor s to t, avoiding processor \u00f0i; j\u0003 1\u00de\nand the faulty processor f . Moreover, this path can be\nprogressively shortened so as to obtain any odd length path\n(of length, at most, k2 \u0003 3) joining s to t (and avoiding f).\nFurthermore, again because of the uniformity of the\nconstruction and also the uniformity of the progressive\nshortening, this progressive shortening can easily be\ncompleted by message-passing between the processors. In\nfact, message-passing can be used so that every processor q\non the path computes a list of triples of the form \u00f0q\u00fe; q\u0003; i\u00de\ndetailing that q appears on a path of length i from s to t so\nthat that the processor q\u0003 (respectively q\u00fe) is the next\nprocessor on this path moving towards s (respectively t).\nThe existence of the edge \u00f0s; t\u00de gives our embedded fault-\navoiding cycles of varying lengths.\nThe above construction can be generalized to an\nanalogous construction of fault-avoiding paths and cycles\nin Qkn, where there is a faulty processor. As we stated\nabove, we have not presented the precise details of this\ngeneralization; what suffices is that the general principle\nhas been presented and any interested reader could\nimplement the construction if needs be. We envisage that\nthere are many other applications of progressive short-\nening but we have chosen not to explore these applica-\ntions here.\n7 CONCLUSIONS\nIn tandem with [15] and [27], we have resolved\ncompletely the main questions concerning panconnectiv-\nity, bipanconnectivity, pancyclicity, and bipancyclicity for\na k-ary n-cube Qkn, when k \u0002 3 and n \u0002 2. In doing so,\nwe have introduced the new concept of the progressive\nshortening of a path and shown how this concept can be\nused to solve a problem related to the embedding of\nlinear arrays and cycles of processors in a distributed-\nmemory multiprocessor whose interconnection network is\na k-ary n-cube and where there is one faulty processor.\nAs directions for future research, we would like to see\nmore applications of progressive shortening (and feel that\nthe concept will prove to be more widely applicable).\nAlso, we would like to see results on panconnectivity,\npancyclicity, and so forth, extended to k-ary n-cubes in\nwhich there may be (a limited number of) faulty vertices\nor edges.\n32 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS, VOL. 20, NO. 1, JANUARY 2009\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Durham.
