Introduction\n[2] The erosion of organic carbon from the continents and\nits transfer to the ocean constitutes an important component\nof the global carbon cycle. It is estimated that rivers deliver\nbetween 90 and 240 \u0002 106 tC a\u00011 of particulate organic\ncarbon (POC) to the ocean [Ittekot, 1988; Berner, 1992;\nMeybeck, 1993; Stallard, 1998; Meybeck and Vo\u00a8ro\u00a8smarty,\n1999; Ludwig et al., 1996; Chen et al., 2001]. This riverine\nPOC transfer is comparable to the estimated global CO2\nconsumption by silicate weathering of 104 \u0002 106 tC a\u00011\n[Gaillardet et al., 1999].\n[3] It has been suggested that fluvial transfer of POC is\nstrongly correlated with the transfer of clastic sediment\n[Ludwig et al., 1996]. A large proportion of the world\u2019s\nsediment discharge to the oceans originates in active moun-\ntain belts [Milliman and Syvitski, 1992]. High-standing,\ntectonically active islands in Oceania contribute \u000333% of\nthe total global clastic sediment input to the oceans from only\n\u00033% of the Earth\u2019s landmass [Milliman and Syvitski, 1992]\nand the associated riverine POC transfer may constitute a\nsimilar proportion of the global riverine total [Stallard, 1998;\nLyons et al., 2002].\n[4] Emergent, active mountain belts are likely to be\nimportant sources of POC delivered to the oceans. Firstly,\nthey have small floodplains and therefore limited potential\nfor subaerial storage and oxidation of sediment. Secondly,\ntheir clastic input to active margins drives very high\nsedimentation rates, for which the efficiency of organic\ncarbon burial is high [Canfield, 1994]. Finally, many small\nmountain rivers discharge a significant amount of their total\nsediment load at hyperpycnal concentrations, where the\ndensity of the water sediment mixture at the river mouth\nis greater than that of the seawater into which it flows\n[Mulder and Syvitski, 1995; Warrick and Milliman, 2003;\nHicks et al., 2004a; Dadson et al., 2005; Milliman and Kao,\n2005]. Hyperpycnal plumes underflow seawater and may\ntransfer sediment and POC direct into poorly oxygenated,\ndeep marine basins. They may also cause rapid deposition\nof thick layers of sediment (decimeter to meter scale) in\nwhich organic carbon can be shielded effectively from\noxidation.\n[5] To assess the impact of riverine transfer of POC on the\nglobal carbon cycle, it is important to determine not only its\nmagnitude but also the source of POC. Riverine POC is\ncomposed of fossil organic carbon, derived from sedimen-\ntary rocks, and nonfossil biogenic, organic carbon (either\nliving biomass or recent, partially degraded material). The\ntransfer of nonfossil biogenic POC to sedimentary basins\nwill contribute to the drawdown of atmospheric CO2\n[France-Lanord and Derry, 1997]. In contrast, the transfer\nof fossil POC from sedimentary rocks to sedimentary basins\nhas no impact on atmospheric composition at that time,\nwhile its oxidation will contribute CO2 to the atmosphere.\n[6] Published estimates of the fossil component of river-\nine POC in small mountain catchments range from less than\n10% up to 75% [Blair et al., 2003; Komada et al., 2005;\nLeithold et al., 2006]. These estimates are mostly for rivers\naffected by human activity [Kao and Liu, 1996; Gomez et\nGLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES, VOL. 22, GB1017, doi:10.1029\/2006GB002905, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge,\nUK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0886-6236\/08\/2006GB002905$12.00\nGB1017 1 of 12\nal., 2004a], which may explain some of this variability. In\norder to assess the human impact on POC yields and the\nrole of riverine POC transfer on longer timescales, it is\nimportant to understand the natural controls on carbon\nfluxes in unperturbed catchments. Moreover, many previ-\nously sampled catchments are located in accretionary tec-\ntonic settings [Leithold et al., 2006] where weak\nsedimentary rocks build subdued relief. Little data is avail-\nable on POC sourcing in mountain belts with high, steep\ntopography in metamorphic bedrock [Burbank et al., 1996;\nHovius et al., 1997]. In both settings river sediment yields\nare high but the mechanisms by which POC is harvested\nand routed from the catchments may not be the same\n[Leithold et al., 2006], and the proportion of fossil and\nnonfossil POC in rivers and the likelihood of its sequestra-\ntion may differ as a result.\n[7] The west flank of the rapidly eroding Southern Alps,\nNew Zealand, has minimal anthropogenic disturbance of\nnatural vegetation. There, small mountain rivers export\nlarge amounts of sediment direct to the ocean [Hicks and\nShankar, 2003]. The associated POC transfer has been\nestimated to be >20 times the global average [Lyons et\nal., 2002; Scott et al., 2006]. However, neither the source of\nthe POC nor the mechanisms of its liberation and transfer\nhave been identified, and the sustainability of the POC\ntransfer remains to be established in the context of the net\nprimary productivity (NPP) in the mountain belt. Here, we\npresent new constraints on the source of riverine POC,\nusing stable isotopes of organic carbon (d13Corg) to distin-\nguish between fossil and nonfossil sources. We then esti-\nmate the transfer of nonfossil biogenic POC and compare it\nwith other significant carbon transfers from the west flank\nof the Southern Alps, and investigate the routing of the\nnonfossil materials on the mountain belt scale, using the\nbulk organic carbon to nitrogen ratio (C\/N) of landslide\ndeposits and suspended load [Townsend-Small et al., 2005,\nHoltvoeth et al., 2005].\n2. Study Area\n[8] The Southern Alps of New Zealand are a linear,\nasymmetric mountain belt formed along the oblique com-\npressional boundary of the Australian and Pacific plates\n[Walcott, 1978]. Moisture-laden northwest winds from the\nTasman Sea drive orographic precipitation of up to 10\u2013\n15 m a\u00011 on the west flank of the mountain belt [Griffiths\nand McSaveney, 1983]. There, sustained rapid mass wasting\nand fluvial incision have exhumed high-grade metamorphic\nrocks at rates of up to \u00037 mm a\u00011 [Bull and Cooper, 1986;\nTippett and Kamp, 1993]. Along the range bounding Alpine\nfault exposed metasedimentary rocks of Mesozoic age\n[Roser and Cooper, 1990] have amphibolite grade mineral\nassemblages formed at 600\u2013650\u0001C and around 10 kbar. The\nmetamorphic grade decreases eastward into the range to\ngreenschist facies (450\u0001C, 6\u20138 kbar) around the main\ndivide [Mortimer, 2000]. Sediment discharge from the west\nflank of the mountain belt is dominated by landslide-derived\nmaterial [Hovius et al., 1997; Korup et al., 2004], sourced\non slopes with a modal steepness of 35\u0001, and transferred in\nsteep bedrock rivers without significant floodplains. The\nspatial and temporal patterns of landsliding over the last\n\u000360 years are well known (Figure 1). Over this time\ninterval landslides have occurred throughout the landscape,\naffecting high and low segments of hillslopes in equal\nmeasure, and sometimes clearing entire valley sides. The\nresult is a patchwork of forest segments with different age\nand biomass.\n[9] Below the tree line at \u00031200 m, high rainfall supports\ntemperate rainforest dominated by softwood\/broad leaved\nhardwood C3 species: Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu),\nPodocarpus dacrydiodes (kahikatea), Wienmannia race-\nmosa (kamahi), and Metrosideros umbellata (southern rata)\n[Wardle, 1984]. The aboveground standing biomass carbon\nstore (including coarse woody debris) is large but variable,\n\u000318,200 \u00b1 12,600 tC km\u00012 (P. J. Bellingham, unpublished\ndata, 2003). In long-lived hillslope hollows Acid Brown\nSoils, Orthic Podzols and Perch-Gley Podzols have devel-\noped and on alluvial patches Fluvial Raw Soils and Fluvial\nRecent Soils are found [Tonkin and Basher, 2001]. These\nsoils tend to be organic carbon rich (5\u201327%) in the upper AH\nhorizons, but concentrations decline rapidly with increasing\ndepth, approaching zero at \u000315 cm depth [Basher, 1986].\nNevertheless, the montane soil carbon store is significant,\n\u00036500\u201313,000 tC km\u00012 [Coomes et al., 2003]. There is little\nanthropogenic disruption of the natural upland state in the\nwestern Southern Alps [Leathwick et al., 2003] in stark\ncontrast to other small mountainous rivers studied for POC\nyields [Kao and Liu, 1996; Gomez et al., 2003].\n3. Materials\n3.1. River Sediment\n[10] At or near the mountain front, samples of suspended\nsediment and bed material of 10 rivers were collected\nbetween 13 September and 6 October 2004 (Figure 2).\nAdditional bed material samples were also collected along\nthe course of the Copland River further into the mountain\nbelt. Rivers were sampled while turbid and sampling was\nrepeated up to three times during the field period. For each\nsample, 4 L of turbid water were collected from the surface\nof the main channel (in a vessel thoroughly rinsed with river\nwater). At suspended load sampling sites, bed material was\ncollected during low discharge. To do this, the upper \u00032 cm\nof the river bed sediment were disturbed, and 4 L of\nsediment and water were collected in order to recover all\nfine-grained material.\n[11] Samples were left to settle in order to separate\nparticulates from the river water. The remaining fluid was\nfiltered through 0.2 mm nylon membrane filters to catch the\nfinest size fraction and this sediment was then added to the\nseparated particulates. Filters were checked for damage after\nfiltration to detect possible sample contamination. The sed-\niment concentrate was then dried at <80\u0001C to evaporate\nremaining water, and finally stored in airtight glass vials.\nBlanks (BK-1, n = 3) of quartz sand torched at 600\u0001C for 3 h\nwere subjected to the same filtration and drying procedure.\n3.2. Landslide Debris and Bedrock\n[12] Landslide deposits were sampled in August 2003.\nFresh, unvegetated exposures of landslide debris were\nGB1017 HILTON ET AL.: LANDSLIDE MOBILIZED POC\n2 of 12\nGB1017\nsampled at \u000310 cm depth intervals from the top surface of\nthe deposit. Samples consisting of approximately 125 cm3\nof material were dried at <80\u0001C on the day of collection and\nthen sieved to isolate the \u2018\u2018sand\u2019\u2019 (63\u2013500 mm) and \u2018\u2018clay\nsilt\u2019\u2019 (<63 mm) fractions. Together, these fractions span the\nsize range of the riverine suspended sediment. Samples\nwere collected from deposits of landslides with different\nsize, area and prefailure vegetation maturity. These attrib-\nutes were determined from time series air photographs,\nLandsat TM imagery and field observations in 1994,\n2003, and 2004 (see Figure 1). All sampled sites are located\nclose to the Alpine fault where exhumation rates are fastest.\n[13] Sites 1, 2, and 3 are in Gaunt Creek, a tributary of the\nWaitangitaona River (Figures 1 and 2). Site 2 and 3 are\nin deposits of a large, slope-clearing landslide (area\n\u00030.318 km2, width \u0003300 m) which failed prior to 1948.\nThis large but rare landslide is of a type that contributes\nsignificantly to the sediment export from the mountain belt\n[Hovius et al., 1997]. The other sample sites are in smaller\nlandslides that dominate the surface area disturbed by mass\nwasting due to their high frequency of occurrence [Stark\nand Hovius, 2001]. Site 1 was fed by small landslides (area\n\u00030.010 km2, width \u000350\u201370 m) that scoured the large\nfailure surface at Gaunt Creek. Site 4 is situated in the\nWhataroa catchment, in a shallow bedrock slide (area =\n0.021 km2, width \u000335 m) with its crown at \u0003400 m asl,\n\u0003150 m below the ridge crest. This landslide reached the\nvalley floor, spreading its debris on grassland \u0003800 m away\nfrom the river channel. Site 5, in the valley floor of HareMare\nCreek, was sourced by a small landslide (area = 0.010 km2,\nwidth\u000340 m) originating at the top of the adjacent hillslope,\nat an elevation of \u0003460 m asl.\n[14] Site 1 was sourced after 1985 by landslides reactivat-\ning a surface that was previously cleared \u000340 years earlier\n(Figure 1). Since then the hillslope has been chronically\nunstable [Korup et al., 2004] and vegetation has not yet\nreached maturity. Similarly, at site 5 the source landslide\noccurred after 1985 on a surface previously cleared by a\nlarger landslide prior to 1948. The large landslide connected\nto sites 2 and 3 occurred on a fully vegetated slope, and site\n4 was supplied by a landslide that occurred after 1994 on a\nhillslope populated by dense, temperate rain forest.\n[15] A suite of unweathered bedrocks were collected by\nPitcairn et al. [2005] and as part of this study. Samples from\nFigure 1. Waitangitaona River catchment in the western Southern Alps, New Zealand. Inset shows the\nregional tectonics of South Island, New Zealand. Box shows area of sampling (Figure 2), and arrow\nshows location of Waitangitaona catchment. Waitangitaona is a typical mountain river: Its upstream\ndrainage area is \u000370 km2, and sediment yield \u000312,500 t km\u00012 a\u00011 [Korup et al., 2004]. Landslides are\nthe dominant source of sediment [Hovius et al., 1997]. Fresh landslide scars have been mapped from air\nphotographs (1948, 1965, 1973, 1980, and 1985 [Hovius et al., 1997]) and Landsat TM (2002, this\nstudy); shown are the temporal and spatial patterns of sediment production over the last \u000360 years.\nSediment samples collected for this study are also shown (also see Figure 2).\nGB1017 HILTON ET AL.: LANDSLIDE MOBILIZED POC\n3 of 12\nGB1017\nthe Alpine Schist were taken along cross-isograd transects\nin the Haast, Franz Josef and Fox catchments (Figure 2).\n4. Methods\n[16] All samples were homogenised by grinding in an\nagate mill. The ground mass was acidified with 6 N HCl\nand placed on a hotplate at <80\u0001C for 4 h to remove\ncarbonate [France-Lanord and Derry, 1994]. Blanks were\nsubjected to the same procedure. Concentrations of organic\ncarbon (Corg) and nitrogen (Norg) were determined by\ncombustion at 1020\u0001C in a Costech CHN elemental ana-\nlyzer, using an acetanilide standard. All values reported for\nriver sediment have been corrected for a full procedural\nblank average (BK-1) of Corg = 0.0033% Norg = 0.00032%.\nLandslide sediment and bedrock samples have not been\nfiltered and have only been corrected for a blank average\n(BK-2, n = 3) of Corg = 0.0010% and Norg = 0.0018%\ncorresponding to contamination from the homogenisation\nand carbonate removal steps.\n[17] A subset of samples was analyzed for stable carbon\nisotopes on a Costech elemental analyzer coupled via a\nCONFLO III to a MAT 253 stable isotope ratio mass\nspectrometer. Reanalysis of samples after a year in storage\nhas shown that the bulk Corg and Norg concentrations, and\nd13Corg, have not changed significantly after initial drying of\nthe sample at 80\u0001C in the field. Long-term reproducibility is\nto 2% and 4% for Corg, and Norg, respectively. The long-\nterm reproducibility of d13Corg values is 0.06% based on 25\nduplicate measurements of river suspended sediment.\n5. Results\n5.1. River Sediment\n[18] Suspended sediment samples were collected at a\nrange of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) varying\nfrom 9.6 mg L\u00011 to 660 mg L\u00011 with a mean for all samples\ncombined of 114 mg L\u00011 (Table 1). This is similar to the\nreported temporal mean SSC of the Hokitika and Haast\nrivers of 133 mg L\u00011 and 119 mg L\u00011, respectively and\ncomes close to the published flux-weighted average SSC of\n645 mg L\u00011 and 700 mg L\u00011 for these two rivers [Hicks et\nal., 2004b].\n[19] The mean POC concentration in the river suspended\nload is Corg = 0.51 \u00b1 0.12% which is at the lower end of\nvalues measured in other mountain rivers [Kao and Liu,\n1996; Masiello and Druffel, 2001; Gomez et al., 2003]. The\nmean POC concentration in river bed material is 0.23 \u00b1\n0.06% and for each catchment the ratio (bed material Corg)\/\n(suspended load Corg) is <1.\n[20] The d13Corg of the river suspended load ranges from\n\u000122.70% to \u000128.02% with a mean of \u000124.9 \u00b1 1.6%\nFigure 2. Suspended sediment, bed material, and landslide sediment sample locations. Arrows show\npublished annual sediment discharge [Hicks et al., 2004b].\nGB1017 HILTON ET AL.: LANDSLIDE MOBILIZED POC\n4 of 12\nGB1017\n(Table 1). When data from all sampled catchments along the\nwestern Southern Alps are combined, a correlation is found\nbetween Corg and d\n13Corg (Figure 3). When the isotopic\ncomposition and the concentration of the same chemical\nelement are considered, the mixing of two distinct end-\nmembers defines a linear relationship between the inverse of\nthe concentration (1\/C) and the isotopic composition (d13C).\nThus the linear fit of the suspended load data (Figure 3) is\nmost simply explained by a binary mixing of two end-\nmembers with distinct Corg and d\n13Corg. Results for the three\nriver bed sediments analyzed for d13Corg are consistent with\nthe binary mixing as described by the suspended load\n(Figure 3).\n[21] River suspended load has a mean C\/N of 14.8 \u00b1 2.1,\nwith a range from 8.3 to 22.5 (Table 1). The mean C\/N of\nbed material is 11.9 \u00b1 1.7, with a range from 8.9 to 14.3, at\nthe lower end of suspended load values.\n5.2. Bedrock\n[22] Measured bedrock samples have Corg ranging from\n0.01% to 0.29% for the dominant quartz-feldspathic lithol-\nogy (Table 2). The d13Corg ranges between \u000118.85% and\n\u000126.17% with a mean of d13Corg = \u000121.1 \u00b1 1.1% (and an\nassociated mean Corg = 0.15 \u00b1 0.05%). Thus bedrock has\nlower Corg and is isotopically heavier than the suspended\nsediment (Figure 3).\n[23] Only five bedrock samples have Norg distinguishable\nfrom the blank. For these samples, C\/N ranges from 4.8 to\n18.9 with a mean of 9.0 \u00b1 5.2 (with an associated mean\nCorg = 0.17 \u00b1 0.10%). This is within the range of values\nmeasured in sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks else-\nwhere [Kao and Liu, 2000; Gomez et al., 2003].\n5.3. Landslide Deposits\n[24] In the five landslide sites, Corg ranges from 0.15% to\n3.33% and there is marked variability between sites (Table 3).\nThe mean Corg of the clay silt fraction ranges from 0.31 \u00b1\n0.01% at site 1 to 2.77 \u00b1 0.51% at site 4. The mean Corg of the\nsand ranges from 0.15 \u00b1 0.01% at site 1 to 2.31 \u00b1 0.45% at\nsite 4. There is marked homogeneity in Corg for each grain\nsize fraction at each site (Table 3). The measured C\/N ranges\nfrom 11.0 to 37.8. The mean C\/N of clay silt ranges from\n11.5 \u00b1 0.5 at site 5 to 30.8 \u00b1 4.7 at site 2. The mean C\/N of\nsand ranges from 13.4 \u00b1 0.8 at site 5 to 28.7 \u00b1 7.4 at site 2.\n[25] Depth transects reveal a lack of vertical trends in both\nCorg and C\/N (Figure 4) at individual sites.

Riverine POC Transfer\n[26] We have combined published estimates of suspended\nsediment transport for some rivers in the study area with our\nobservations to estimate POC export (Table 4). Most of our\nsuspended sediment sediment samples were collected at\ntimes when SSC was below the flux-weighted average\nSSC (Table 1) [Hicks et al., 2004b], which may lead to an\noverestimation of POC transfer if an inverse relation be-\ntween SSC and Corg is assumed [c.f. Ludwig et al., 1996].\nHowever, these small mountain rivers show a weak corre-\nlation between SSC and Corg and a nearly constant Corg at\nSSC above \u0003100 mg L\u00011 (Table 1). We therefore assume\nthat the Corg values presented in this study are representative\nof average SSC conditions. We estimate that the mean POC\nyield from the western Southern Alps is 57 tC km\u00012 a\u00011\n(Table 4). This is >30 times the global average [Ludwig et\nal., 1996] and similar to estimates from other small moun-\ntainous catchments [Gomez et al., 2003]. Our estimate of\nthe specific yield of POC in the catchment of the Hokitika\nriver, 47 tC km\u00012 a\u00011, is similar to previous estimates of 43\nand 44 tC km\u00012 a\u00011 [Lyons et al., 2002; Carey et al., 2005].\nHowever, our estimate for the Haast catchment of 15 tC\nkm\u00012 a\u00011 is much lower than the previous estimate of 71 tC\nkm\u00012 a\u00011 [Lyons et al., 2002], due in part to a downward\nadjustment of the sediment yield from the catchment from\n12,700 t km\u00012 a\u00011 to 4500 t km\u00012 a\u00011 [Lyons et al., 2005].\nIf the exhumation rate across the western Southern Alps is\n\u00035 mm a\u00011 [Bull and Cooper, 1986; Tippett and Kamp,\n1993], then the long-term sediment yields from this domain\nare \u000312,500 t km\u00012 a\u00011. Therefore the POC yield presented\nhere for the Haast is a minimum. To prepare a further\ndiscussion of the riverine transfer of POC from the western\nSouthern Alps we must first consider the origin of the POC.\n[27] The d13Corg and Corg measured in suspended sedi-\nment define a binary mixing of two distinct end-members\n(Figure 3). One end-member is isotopically light and\nenriched in Corg, the other is isotopically heavy and depleted\nin Corg. The mean of carbon values measured in bedrock\nsamples from the study area lies on the mixing line (Figure 3),\nand we propose that fossil POC in bedrock best defines the\ndepleted end-member. The enriched end-member sits within\nthe field of isotopic compositions characteristic of C3\nvegetation growing at <2000m elevation [Ko\u00a8rner et al.,\n1988] and of soils in montane catchments [Bird et al.,\n1994]. Therefore the range of concentrations and isotopic\ncompositions of the POC in suspended sediment and bed\nmaterials of rivers in the western Southern Alps can be\nTable 2.

This can be done\nin two ways. One considers only the Corg of the sediment\nand assumes that any enrichment of organic carbon in the\nsuspended load, above the Corg of the fossil end-member, is\ndue to an addition of nonfossil POC. For this purpose, the\nfossil POC end-member is assigned the mean measured\nbedrock value of Corg = 0.15%. The other method makes\nuse of the isotopic composition of the carbon. The fossil\nPOC, end-member is assigned a value of d13Corg =\n\u000121.1%, the mean value measured in bedrock, and the\nnonfossil end-member is attributed a value of d13Corg =\n\u000128.3%, obtained by extrapolation of the best fit to the data\n(Figure 3). These two approaches produce compatible\nestimates of the fraction of fossil POC, with an average\ndiscrepancy of 0.03. There are more measurements of Corg\nthan of d13Corg (Table 1), and on the basis of this charac-\nteristic we estimate that the fossil fraction of POC in river\nsuspended load is on average 0.37 \u00b1 0.07, with a range of\n0.13 to 0.75 (Table 4), comparable to estimates from other\nsmall mountain rivers [Kao and Liu, 1996; Masiello and\nDruffel, 2001; Blair et al., 2003; Komada et al., 2005;\nLeithold et al., 2006]. Thus the fossil contribution to the\nPOC load is large despite the dense hillslope organic carbon\nstore, minimal upland anthropogenic disturbance and low\nCorg in metasedimentary bedrock in the western Southern\nAlps.\n[29] Using the mean suspended load Corg and the mean\nfraction of nonfossil Corg for each catchment (Tables 1 and\n4), the mean nonfossil biogenic POC transfer for the\nwestern Southern Alps is 39 tC km\u00012 a\u00011, ranging from 9\nto 87 tC km\u00012 a\u00011 for individual catchments (Table 4).\nThese POC yields do not account for bedload transport\nwhich can represent as much as 50% of the total riverine\ntransport of sediment in an active orogen [Galy and France-\nLanord, 2001; Dadson et al., 2003], and may contain a\nsignificant amount of biogenic POC when coarse woody\ndebris is rigorously considered. The suspended sediment\ntransfer of nonfossil POC represents \u00030.1% of the hillslope\ncarbon store of \u000328,000 tC km\u00012 [Coomes et al., 2003] and\n\u00034% of the annual net primary productivity of \u00031100 tC\nkm\u00012 a\u00011 [Whitehead et al., 2002]. From this we conclude\nthat the high measured yields of nonfossil POC are sustain-\nable on long timescales in a densely vegetated biome\nundergoing rapid uplift and erosion, such as the western\nSouthern Alps.\n[30] Burdige [2005] has estimated the burial efficiency of\nterrestrial organic matter (relative to the riverine input) for\nnondeltaic continental margin sediments at \u000317%, and at\nsediment accumulation rates greater than 0.1 g cm\u00012 a\u00011\nmeasured burial efficiency is consistently above 10%. Galy\net al. [2007] have reported even higher burial rates in the\nBay of Bengal. On margins receiving sediment from small\nmountain rivers, sedimentation rates may approach 5 g\ncm\u00012 a\u00011 [Gomez et al., 2004b]. Moreover, rivers draining\nthe western Southern Alps may on occasion discharge large\namounts of sediment to the ocean at hyperpycnal concen-\ntrations [Mulder and Syvitski, 1995]. Hyperpycnal river\nplumes can turn into turbidity currents and result in thick\nsediment beds. Thus they provide a mechanism for deliv-\nering terrestrial POC rapidly to deep sea depocentres [Walsh\nand Nittrouer, 2003; Nakajima, 2006] and for shielding\ndeposited POC from oxygenated ocean water. Therefore it\nseems reasonable to assume that at least 10% of the POC\noutput from the western Southern Alps is preserved in long-\nlived sedimentary deposits. At this conservative preserva-\ntion rate, the transfer of eroded biogenic POC to sediment is\n\u00034 tC km\u00012 a\u00011. Considering that the rate CO2 drawdown\nby silicate weathering in the same area is 3.5 tC km\u00012 a\u00011\n[Jacobson and Blum, 2003; Lyons et al., 2005], the transfer\nand burial of nonfossil biogenic POC is likely to be the\nmore significant way in which the Southern Alps consume\natmospheric CO2 on geological timescales. By extrapola-\ntion, the harvesting and burial of modern biogenic POC in\nbasins fed by steep river catchments in active mountain\nTable 3.

Routing of POC\n[31] The occurrence of a single nonfossil end-member is\nintriguing, given that at the scale of individual plant species,\nlitters and soils there can be a large range in both d13Corg\n[Guehl et al., 1998] and Corg [Hart et al., 2003]. The d\n13Corg\nof soils and vegetation tend to overlap in montane catch-\nments [Bird et al., 1994; Townsend-Small et al., 2005]. The\nvariable proportion of nonfossil POC in the riverine sedi-\nment (Table 4) could therefore represent a fairly stable\namount of POC derived from rock and soil but a variable\ncontribution from vegetation. The C\/N of POC can be used\nto distinguish between nonfossil carbon from soil and\nvegetation [Townsend-Small et al., 2005; Holtvoeth et al.,\n2005]. C\/N is 16 to 25 in surface soil horizons [Basher,\n1986]. By contrast, in C3 vegetation in an indigenous\nmontane forest ecosystem similar to that studied here, C\/\nN is around 40 in the leaf component, 78 to 157 for twigs\nand small branches, through \u0003250 for bark, to >600 in stem\nwood [Hart et al., 2003].\n[32] Unlike the Corg and d\n13Corg data, the C\/N and Corg\ndata for river sediment in the western Southern Alps shows\nsignificant scatter. Hence a simple binary mixing model\ndescribed by the linear best fit with C\/N = (a \u0002 Corg + b)\/(c\n\u0002 Corg + d) does not describe the data well, R2 = 0.29\n(Figure 5a). Some of the suspended sediment and most of\nthe bed material have C\/N and Corg close to the average\ncomposition of the Alpine Schist bedrock (Figure 5a),\nreemphasising the significant contribution of fossil POC\nfrom bedrock inferred from d13Corg.

For example, the Hokitika River is characterized\nby the mixing of bedrock and soil material, the Poerua River\nhas nonfossil POC derived mainly from vegetation, and\nnonfossil POC in the Whataroa and Waitangitanoa Rivers\nappears to be a mixture of materials derived from soils and\nvegetation (Figure 5a and Table 1). Notwithstanding this\ncomplexity, our data suggest that at the catchment scale,\nmobilization of POC occurs by processes that reduce the\nheterogeneity of the nonfossil POC and mix it with signif-\nicant amounts of fossil POC from bedrock.\n[33] The processes by which this mixing occurs can be\nexamined by looking at landslide deposits and the nature of\nPOC within individual deposits. Hillslopes in the western\nSouthern Alps have significant stores of carbon in standing\nbiomass, partially degraded litter and coarse woody debris,\nand surface soils [Coomes et al., 2003; P. J. Bellingham,\nunpublished data, 2003]. The measured compositions of\nPOC in landslide debris occupy a section of the ternary\nmixing space of bedrock, soil and vegetation end-members\nlarger than the river sediment discussed above (Figure 5b)\nHowever, their range is restricted when compared with Corg\nand C\/N measured in soil and vegetation, and values for\nPOC in landslide debris plot very near the bedrock end-\nmember. This shows that POC from vegetation, soil and\nbedrock have been mixed in landslide debris.\n[34] All sampled landslide deposits show a lack of vertical\ntrends in profiles of both Corg and C\/N (Figure 4). This\nhomogeneity most likely originates from destruction, and\neffective mixing of hillslope biomass and soil with bedrock\nduring mass wasting. In addition, the ratio of Corg in the\nclay silt\/sand fractions is always >1 (Table 3). This may not\nbe expected for landslide sediment where fresh bedrock\nmay have been broken into a large range of grain sizes. It\nsuggests that POC is dominantly fine grained and that a\nlarge proportion of the POC is probably associated or bound\nto mineral surfaces. As mean C\/N values are very similar for\nthe clay silt and sand fractions in landslide debris (Table 3),\nthe POC at these grain sizes has essentially identical\nsources. Its concentration is set by mineral dilution. Taken\ntogether, these observations suggest that the composition,\nconcentration and distribution of POC in landslide debris\nare due to a combination of two processes. Landsliding\nharvests bedrock, soil and standing biomass. During down-\nslope transport the grain size of this material is mechanically\nreduced, and contributions from different sources are mixed.\nThis results in homogenization of POC in landslide debris,\nand a dilution of high concentrations of POC in soil and\nTable 4.

How-\never, this mechanism cannot fully explain the dominance of\nfine POC in landslide deposits and its association to mineral\nsurfaces. These attributes are likely to be due to pedogenic\nprocesses [Sollins et al., 1996] acting on hillslope materials\nprior to slope failure, and on landslide debris after deposition.\n[35] Given that the POC in landslide debris is a mixture of\nmaterials from fossil and nonfossil sources, the bedrock\nend-member (Figure 3) can be used to estimate that the\nnonfossil component of the POC ranges from 0% to 95% of\nthe total. Considerable intersite variability, seen both in Corg\nand in C\/N (Figure 5b), can best be explained with reference\nto the characteristics of the sampled landslides. The depth of\na landslide sets the relative bedrock contribution, and the\nstate of hillslope vegetation prior to landsliding determines\nthe biogenic input to landslide debris. In agreement with\nthis notion, in the small, shallow landslide of site 4 the mean\nCorg is 4 to 6 times higher than at sites 2 and 3 in debris\nsourced from a large, deep failure with a greater contribu-\ntion from the bedrock. Moreover, the differences in Corg and\nC\/N between these sites (Figure 5b) may reflect differences\nin the source of the nonfossil carbon\u2013standing biomass for\nsites 2 and 3, and soil and biomass for site 4. Site 5 was fed\nby a recent landslide located within an older (>60 years),\nlarger landslide scar on which vegetation had not reached\nfull maturity when failure reoccurred. In contrast, site 4 was\nsourced from a slide that disrupted mature forest. Lower\nvalues of Corg and C\/N at site 5 relative to site 4 (Figure 5b)\nmay reflect depleted biomass and thin soil in the source area\nof site 5 prior to failure. Together, the five sites at which we\nhave sampled landslide deposits span a range of source\nareas from \u00030.01 km2 to \u00030.3 km2. This covers a substan-\ntial segment of the total size range of landslides mapped in\nthe western Southern Alps [Hovius et al., 1997]. Therefore\nwe are confident that our sample of landslide deposits\nshould provide a reasonable constraint on the composition\nand abundance of POC contained in landslide debris\nthroughout the mountain belt.\n[36] At the mountain belt scale a large number of bedrock\nlandslides contribute sediment to rivers [Hovius et al.,\n1997]. For example, analysis of a time series of aerial\nphotographs has revealed that in the Whataroa catchment\nalone (Figure 2) at least 315 landslides occurred between\n1965 and 1985. If rivers source their sediment and POC\nmainly from the numerous landslide deposits in their\ncatchment area, then the POC load of a river at the mountain\nfront represents the integral of contributions from all active\nlandslide sources. Mixing of the biogenic POC from differ-\nent hillslope stores has already happened in the landslides\n(Figure 5b), and this is why the composition of POC in river\nsuspended load can simply be described as a binary mix of\nmaterial from fossil and nonfossil sources (Figures 3 and\n5a). Surface runoff, which can deliver organic rich partic-\nulate material from standing biomass and litter, cannot\nexplain the large fossil POC component measured in the\nrivers of the western Southern Alps. Landslides explain the\nlow biogenic component in the riverine POC (of 63 \u00b1 7%)\nand should be important in the routing of POC from other\nrapidly uplifting mountain belts where metamorphic bed-\nrock builds steep topography.\n7. Conclusions\n[37] Using the organic carbon concentration (Corg), stable\ncarbon isotopes (d13Corg) and the organic carbon to nitrogen\nratio (C\/N) we have determined the main sources of POC\nexported by rivers from the tectonically active western\nSouthern Alps, New Zealand, where anthropogenic distur-\nbance is minimal. There, landslides mobilize standing\nbiomass and soil POC and dilute it with bedrock. Their\ndeposits comprise a mixture of these sources. At grain sizes\n<500 mm they contain between 0% and 95% nonfossil\nbiogenic POC. Variations between landslide deposits are a\nconsequence of differing vegetation state of the hillslope\nprior to failure, and the depth of the landslide (i.e., propor-\ntion of bedrock). Mechanical breakdown of coarse POC and\nmixing during mass wasting and pedogenic processes that\nassociate organic carbon with mineral grains act to homog-\nenize POC within deposits. At the catchment scale, rivers\nsource POC from many landslide deposits and heterogene-\nities are integrated. As a consequence the suspended load\ncan be described by a binary mixing of fossil and nonfossil\nPOC. We estimate that 63 \u00b1 7% of the suspended load POC\nis from nonfossil biogenic sources. This is similar to\nestimates from mountain rivers elsewhere despite the dense\nhillslope organic carbon store (\u000328,000 tC km\u00012), Corg-\npoor metasedimentary bedrock, and minimal upland anthro-\npogenic disturbance in the western Southern Alps, and we\nattribute dilution of nonfossil POC to the dominant role of\nbedrock landsliding in the mobilization of POC in this\nmountain belt.\n[38] In the western Southern Alps the atmospheric CO2\ntransfer via transport of terrestrial biogenic POC is on\naverage 39 tC km\u00012 a\u00011, an order of magnitude greater\nFigure 5b. Landslide sediment samples together with the\nsame mixing relationships (Figure 5a). Solid and open\ntriangles show clay silt (<63 mm) and sand (<500 mm,\n>63 mm) fractions, respectively. Numbers correspond to\neach landslide site (Table 3).\nGB1017 HILTON ET AL.: LANDSLIDE MOBILIZED POC\n10 of 12\nGB1017\nthan the published CO2 consumption by silicate weathering\nin the same area. The huge hillslope carbon store and high\nnet primary productivity mean that the POC transfer is\nsustainable on long timescales. If 10% or more of this\nPOC escapes oxidation, which is likely on active margins\nwhere continental sediment supply is high, then the harvest-\ning of POC from hillslopes and its sequestration in foreland\nsediments is the most significant way in which this active\nmountain belt impacts atmospheric composition. This may\nbe true for many active orogens drained to the ocean by\nshort, steep rivers, which are known to account for a large\nproportion of the global riverine POC transfer.\n[39] Acknowledgments.
