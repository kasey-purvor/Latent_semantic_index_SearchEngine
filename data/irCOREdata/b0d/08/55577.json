INTRODUCTION 83 \n1.1. Motivation 84 \nThe southern Bellingshausen Sea (Fig. 1) is a major outlet for ice draining 85 \nboth the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and the Antarctic Peninsula Ice 86 \nSheet (APIS). Compared to the Antarctic Peninsula margin and the West 87 \nAntarctic continental margin in the Weddell, Amundsen and Ross seas, 88 \nhowever, the southern Bellingshausen Sea and its hinterland are poorly 89 \nstudied areas. Until recently, no huge ice-drainage system had been observed 90 \nthere (e.g. Drewry, 1983), but a ground-based radar survey in 2009\/2010 has 91 \nrevealed that directly to the south of Eltanin Bay (Fig. 1) an ice stream 92 \nextends ~120 km landward into the WAIS, thereby draining a catchment of 93 \n~12,000 km2 through a ~12 km wide and \u22643 km deep subglacial trough 94 \n(Bingham et al., 2010). 95 \nBoth the WAIS and the APIS have shown dramatic signs of ice loss over the 96 \nlast few decades (e.g. Rignot et al., 2004, 2008; Scambos et al., 2004; 97 \nThomas et al., 2004; Vaughan, 2008; Pritchard et al., 2009; Wingham et al., 98 \n2009). The WAIS is largely grounded below sea level and therefore 99 \nconsidered to be the most vulnerable part of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (e.g. 100 \nOppenheimer, 1998; Vaughan, 2008). A complete WAIS collapse would raise 101 \nglobal sea level by ~3.3 m to 5 m (e.g. Vaughan, 2008; Bamber et al., 2009). 102 \nIf recent WAIS drawdown observed in the Amundsen Sea sector continues, 103 \nthis melting alone will cause global sea level to rise by ~1.5 m (Vaughan, 104 \n2008). A collapse of the land-based APIS would raise global sea level by 105 \n~0.24 m (Pritchard & Vaughan, 2007), but the significance of its contribution 106 \nto sea-level rise in the near future is under debate (cf. Shepherd & Wingham, 107 \n5 \n2007; Pritchard & Vaughan, 2007; Rignot et al., 2008). 108 \nCurrently it is unclear to what extent the modern, negative ice-mass balance 109 \naffecting the APIS and the WAIS is connected to the longer term deglaciation 110 \nprocesses, which started at the termination of the last ice age and may have 111 \ncontinued well into the Holocene (e.g. Bindschadler, 1998; Conway et al., 112 \n1999; Pudsey & Evans, 2001; Stone et al., 2003; Alley et al., 2005; Domack et 113 \nal., 2005; Bentley et al., 2006, 2009; Heroy & Anderson, 2005, 2007; 114 \nDowdeswell et al., 2008b; Johnson et al., 2008). Similarly, it is unclear if 115 \nAntarctic deglaciation since the last glacial period has contributed to 116 \nprominent global meltwater pulses (Clark et al., 2002; Peltier, 2005; Licht, 117 \n2004; Bassett et al., 2007). Therefore, knowledge of the history of the WAIS 118 \nand the APIS since the last ice age is crucial not only for a better 119 \nunderstanding of fundamental ice-sheet dynamics, but also for a reliable 120 \nprediction of future WAIS and APIS behaviour in response to modern global 121 \nwarming (Alley et al., 2005; Vaughan, 2008). 122 \nIn this paper, we present multi-proxy datasets from marine sediment cores 123 \nfrom the West Antarctic continental shelf in the southern Bellingshausen Sea. 124 \nThe subglacial and glaciomarine sequences span the time from the last glacial 125 \nmaximum (LGM) to present (note: the LGM in Antarctica is generally assumed 126 \nto have occurred between 19.5-16.0 ka B.P., e.g. Gersonde et al., 2005, but 127 \nhere we use the term \u2015LGM\u2016 in a regional sense, defining the LGM as the time 128 \nof the last maximum ice-sheet advance in the study area). The new data from 129 \nseabed surface sediments and sediment cores comprise physical properties, 130 \ngrain-size distribution, contents of organic carbon (Corg) and calcite (CaCO3), 131 \nCorg\/nitrogen ratios and isotope geochemical composition of organic matter 132 \n6 \n(14C, 13Corg), planktonic foraminifera tests (\n18O, 13C, 14C) and bulk 133 \nsediments (210Pb). We combine the new data with previously published core 134 \ndata (clay mineral assemblages, shear strength) to refine the lithological 135 \nclassification of the sediments and the reconstruction of their depositional 136 \nenvironments. On the basis of our distinction between subglacial, grounding-137 \nline proximal, sub-ice shelf\/sub-sea ice and seasonal open-marine facies, we 138 \nestablish a radiocarbon chronology that, for the first time, provides a timeline 139 \nof WAIS and APIS retreat from the southern Bellingshausen Sea shelf since 140 \nthe LGM. 141 \n1.2. Study area 142 \nThe southern Bellingshausen Sea is located on the Pacific continental margin 143 \nof Antarctica (Fig. 1). Water depths on the middle and outer shelf are mostly 144 \nbetween ~450 m and ~650 m, with water depth in deep basins on the inner 145 \nshelf ranging from ~800 m to ~1200 m (Fig. 1; Miller & Grobe, 1996; \u00d3 146 \nCofaigh et al., 2005b; Wellner et al., 2006; Jenkins & Jacobs, 2008). Glaciers 147 \nand ice streams drain ice from the WAIS via narrow ice tongues into Eltanin 148 \nBay and via small ice shelves into bays and inlets along the English Coast 149 \nand the western Bryan Coast. In contrast, ice drainage from the APIS is 150 \nmainly via the George VI Ice Shelf that flows into Ronne Entrance. 151 \nAdditionally, small ice shelves along the western coast of Alexander Island 152 \ndrain a local ice cap resting on this island, which we consider to be a part of 153 \nthe APIS. 154 \nSurface water currents on the shelf of the southern Bellingshausen Sea are 155 \ndriven by the westward flowing \u2015Antarctic Coastal Current\u2016 (e.g. Glasby, 156 \n1990). Current speeds seem to be faster over the shelf break and continental 157 \n7 \nslope because of the presence of an oceanographic front, the \u2015Southern 158 \nboundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current\u2016 (SBACC) (Orsi et al., 1995). 159 \nSurface and deep waters north of the SBACC flow eastward as part of the 160 \nclockwise flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), whereas bottom-water 161 \nflow on the upper continental rise is affected by a westward flowing current 162 \n(Hillenbrand et al., 2003). The Antarctic Slope Front, which is an almost 163 \ncircum-Antarctic oceanographic feature associated with a westward flowing 164 \ncurrent along the continental slope, was not observed in the study area 165 \n(Whitworth et al., 1998). At present, upwelling of relatively warm Circumpolar 166 \nDeep Water (CDW) takes place at the continental margin in the southern 167 \nBellingshausen Sea (Jenkins & Jacobs, 2008). CDW locally protrudes far onto 168 \nthe shelf, where it causes intense basal melting of ice shelves (e.g. Jacobs et 169 \nal., 1996). 170 \n1.3. Previous work 171 \nThe first marine geoscientific data published from the southern 172 \nBellingshausen Sea were multi-channel seismic profiles crossing the outer 173 \nshelf, continental slope and rise (Nitsche et al., 1997, 2000; Cunningham et 174 \nal.; 2002; Scheuer et al., 2006). The seismic stratigraphy on the outer shelf 175 \nand slope shows a general transition from aggradational to progradational and 176 \nthen back to aggradational geometries. The seismic profiles revealed 177 \nunconformities on the outer shelf and evidence for debris flows and slumps on 178 \nthe slope. These depositional patterns were interpreted as results of repeated 179 \nWAIS advances and retreats across the shelf during the Pliocene and 180 \nQuaternary (Nitsche et al., 1997, 2000; Cunningham et al., 2002; Scheuer et 181 \nal., 2006). Nitsche et al. (1997, 2000) noted that the slope in the study area is 182 \n8 \ngentler (1-2\u00b0) but that the shelf break prograded further (~32 km) than in other 183 \nareas of the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas. Moreover, Nitsche et al. 184 \n(2000) concluded that bathymetric data point to a broad sediment lobe on the 185 \nslope, centred at ~87.5\u00b0W (cf. Dowdeswell et al., 2006). 186 \nMulti-beam swath bathymetry data published by Wellner et al. (2001, 2006) 187 \nrevealed that the seafloor on the shelf north of Eltanin Bay exhibits a wide 188 \nrange of subglacial bedforms including large-scale P-forms eroded into 189 \nbedrock on the inner shelf evolving into elongated drumlins and mega-scale 190 \nglacial lineations (MSGL) on the middle shelf. Wellner et al. (2001) argued 191 \nthat the bathymetric data point to the presence of a large cross-shelf trough 192 \nand that sediment cores collected from the MSGLs recovered soft tills. 193 \nWellner et al. (2001, 2006) inferred from these observations that the WAIS 194 \nhad expanded onto the southern Bellingshausen Sea shelf at the LGM. 195 \nIn a more comprehensive study, \u00d3 Cofaigh et al. (2005b) presented multi-196 \nbeam swath bathymetry and sub-bottom profiler data from the shelf and slope. 197 \nThe data revealed the existence of a ~250 km long, \u2264150 km wide and 500-198 \n1200 m deep cross-shelf trough (\"Belgica Trough\"; Fig. 1). On the outer shelf, 199 \nBelgica Trough is 600-680 m deep with adjacent shallower banks, where 200 \nwater depths decrease to 400-500 m. A small second-order trough is eroded 201 \ninto the main trough on the outer shelf. The floor of Belgica Trough from the 202 \nmiddle to the outer shelf is characterised by MSGLs, which are overprinted by 203 \niceberg furrows on the outermost shelf. The MSGLs are formed in an 204 \nacoustically transparent substratum consisting of a massive diamicton with 205 \nlow shear strength that is interpreted as soft subglacial till (\u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 206 \n2005b, 2007). \u00d3 Cofaigh et al. (2005b) concluded that a grounded ice stream 207 \n9 \nflowed through Belgica Trough to the outer shelf (and probably to the shelf 208 \nbreak) at the LGM. This ice stream was fed by ice draining both the WAIS 209 \nthrough Eltanin Bay and the APIS through Ronne Entrance, with the area of 210 \nthe drainage basin probably exceeding 200,000 km2. Apart from the MSGLs 211 \nand iceberg scours within Belgica Trough, the authors observed streamlined 212 \nbedrock and drumlins on the inner shelf and grounding zone wedges on the 213 \ninner and middle shelf (cf. \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2008). Moreover, \u00d3 Cofaigh et al. 214 \n(2005b) demonstrated that the sediment lobe on the slope adjacent to Belgica 215 \nTrough is an associated trough mouth fan (\u2015Belgica TMF\"; Fig. 1). Gullies, 216 \nchannels and small slide scars with associated debris flows were detected 217 \nalong the shelf break and on the continental slope (Dowdeswell et al. 2008a; 218 \nNoormets et al. 2009). 219 \nThe first detailed geological investigation of marine sediments from the study 220 \narea was carried out by Hillenbrand et al. (2003), who inferred modern 221 \ndepositional processes, transport pathways of terrigenous detritus and modes 222 \nof biological productivity by analysing seabed surface and near-surface 223 \nsediments. The main objective of subsequent work on long sediment cores 224 \nrecovered from the continental shelf, slope and rise of the southern 225 \nBellingshausen Sea was the reconstruction of subglacial and glaciomarine 226 \ndepositional processes since the LGM. Hillenbrand et al. (2005) investigated 227 \nthree gravity cores recovered from the western Belgica Trough and the 228 \nwestern flank of Belgica TMF and focussed on the interpretation of 229 \nlithologically similar soft diamictons. The authors used a multi-proxy approach 230 \nto distinguish subglacial soft till from glaciomarine diamicton and glaciogenic 231 \ndebris flows. Recently, Hillenbrand et al. (2009) presented lithological logs, 232 \n10 \nclay mineral data and preliminary facies interpretations for an additional 18 233 \nsediment cores from the shelf and slope. This work deciphered the 234 \nrelationship between the provenance of subglacial, ice marginal and seasonal 235 \nopen-marine (i.e. post-glacial) sediments, which revealed a complex pattern of 236 \nsubglacial erosion, reworking and deposition, and discussed the implications 237 \nfor the reconstruction of ice-drainage patterns at the LGM. Both the studies of 238 \nmulti-beam swath bathymetry data and acoustic sub-bottom profiles (\u00d3 239 \nCofaigh et al., 2005b; Dowdeswell et al., 2008a; Noormets et al., 2009) and 240 \nthe analyses of sediment cores (Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009) concluded that 241 \nthe WAIS and APIS advanced to the shelf break in the southern 242 \nBellingshausen Sea at the LGM. 243 \n2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 244 \nUndisturbed seafloor surface sediments were recovered with box and multiple 245 \ncorers and longer sedimentary sequences were collected with gravity corers 246 \nduring cruises JR104 with RRS James Clark Ross in 2004 and ANT-XI\/3 with 247 \nRV Polarstern in 1994 (Miller & Grobe, 1996; Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). 248 \nThe sediment cores were described visually and from X-radiographs prepared 249 \nat the British Geological Survey (Edinburgh, UK). Volume-specific magnetic 250 \nsusceptibility (MS) and wet-bulk density (WBD) of whole cores were 251 \nmeasured with GEOTEK multi-sensor core loggers at the British Ocean 252 \nSediment Core Research Facility (BOSCORF, Southampton, UK) and the 253 \nAlfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI, Bremerhaven, 254 \nGermany), respectively. Contents of total carbon (TC), organic carbon (Corg) 255 \nand total nitrogen (Ntot) were determined on dried, homogenized bulk 256 \nsediment samples using LECO Carbon Determinators (CS-125, CS-400 and 257 \n11 \nCNS-2000) at AWI. Relative analytical precision was 1% for the TC 258 \nmeasurements and 3% for the Corg measurements, respectively. The CaCO3 259 \ncontents of the samples were calculated from the TC and Corg contents. In 260 \naddition, Corg\/Ntot ratios were calculated. 261 \nGrain-size distribution was analysed on bulk sediment samples (all samples 262 \ncollected on cruise JR104) and decalcified sediment samples (all samples 263 \ncollected on cruise ANT-XI\/3), respectively. Grain-size distribution of the 264 \ncoarse fraction (>62.5 \u00b5m) was investigated by dry sieving, and that of the fine 265 \nfraction (<62.5 \u00b5m) of cores GC357, GC366, GC368, GC372 and GC374 was 266 \nanalysed by laser granulometry using a MALVERN microplus 5100 267 \nmastersizer at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). In this study, we use the 268 \ngrain-size data to refine the lithological core descriptions presented in 269 \nHillenbrand et al. (2009). The mineralogical analysis of the clay fraction (<2 270 \n\u00b5m) and measurement of shear strength were previously described in 271 \nHillenbrand et al. (2009). 272 \nStable oxygen ( 18O) and carbon ( 13C) isotopes of planktonic foraminifera 273 \ntests (Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral) picked from the coarse fraction 274 \n(>62.5 \u00b5m) of gravity cores GC352, GC357, GC368, GC370, GC371, GC372 275 \nand GC374 were analysed with a Thermo-Finnigan MAT 253 mass 276 \nspectrometer at the Godwin Laboratory for Palaeoclimate Research 277 \n(Cambridge University, UK). Those from multiple core PS2543-3 were 278 \nanalysed with a Thermo-Finnigan MAT 251 mass spectrometer at AWI. 279 \nDown-core excess 210Pb activity profiles of box cores BC364X, BC369Y and 280 \nBC373Y were measured at the Scottish Association for Marine Science 281 \n(SAMS) Dunstaffnage Marine Laboratory (Oban, UK). The excess 210Pb 282 \n12 \nactivity was determined by analysing total 210Pb and 226Ra on bulk samples 283 \nusing gamma spectroscopy. Approximately 10 g of freeze-dried sediment at 1 284 \ncm-intervals were carefully weighed into a plastic lid, pressed, and sealed for 285 \nat least 24 days prior to analysis using high purity germanium detectors (Hp 286 \nGe). 287 \nAll samples selected for AMS radiocarbon dating were prepared and analysed 288 \n(14C, Corg, \n13Corg) at the AMS Radiocarbon Facility of the Institute for Physics 289 \nat Erlangen University (Germany). If present, we dated calcareous material, 290 \nmainly foraminifera tests of N. pachyderma sin. (~10 mg) picked from 1-2 cm 291 \nthick sediment slices, because these 14C dates provide the most reliable 292 \nradiocarbon ages (e.g. Domack et al., 2005; Heroy & Anderson, 2007; 293 \nRosenheim et al., 2008). All other 14C ages were obtained by dating the acid-294 \ninsoluble organic fraction (AIO) of bulk sediment samples (cf. Licht et al., 295 \n1996, 1998; Domack et al., 1999, 2001; Licht & Andrews, 2002; Pudsey et al., 296 \n2006). We give the radiocarbon ages as conventional, i.e. uncorrected, and 297 \ncorrected 14C years before present (B.P.; relative to AD 1950). We corrected 298 \n14C ages obtained from calcareous material by subtracting the regional marine 299 \nreservoir effect (MRE). The MRE in the study area was inferred from the 300 \nuncorrected 14C age of a scaphopod (Dentalium majorinum; pers. comm. K. 301 \nLinse, BAS), which was sticking in the sediment surface of box core BC364 302 \nrecovered from site GC365 on the inner shelf in Eltanin Bay (Fig. 1). This 303 \nregional MRE of 1,294\u00b151 yrs B.P. is in agreement with the MRE range of 304 \n750-1,300 14C years determined in other parts of the Southern Ocean (e.g. 305 \nGordon & Harkness, 1992; Harden et al., 1992; Berkman & Forman, 1996; 306 \nDomack et al., 2005). 307 \n13 \nWe corrected the AIO ages of the seafloor surface sediments by subtracting 308 \nthe MRE and the local contamination offset (LCO) inferred from the 14C ages 309 \nof the calcareous (micro-)fossils. The LCO is caused by the mixing of fresh, 310 \nrecently formed organic matter (formed mainly by diatoms) with reworked, 311 \nfossil organic matter (e.g. Licht et al., 1996; Andrews et al., 1999; Pudsey et 312 \nal., 2006; Ohkouchi & Eglinton, 2008; Rosenheim et al., 2008; Hillenbrand et 313 \nal., 2010). At core sites, for which 14C dates from calcareous material were 314 \nunavailable, we assumed that the surface sediments are of modern age. 315 \nFollowing common practice, we corrected the down-core AIO ages by 316 \nsubtracting the core-top ages of box cores taken from the same site or nearby 317 \nlocations (e.g. Licht et al., 1996, 1998; Domack et al., 1999; Licht & Andrews, 318 \n2002; Mosola & Anderson, 2006; Pudsey et al., 2006). 319 \nFor supplementary data see 320 \nhttp:\/\/doi.pangaea.de\/10.1594\/PANGAEA.742532. 321 \n3. RESULTS 322 \n3.1. Lithostratigraphy 323 \nWe previously described and interpreted the lithological units of the studied 324 \nsediment cores (Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009). Here, we refine the original 325 \nlithological classifications (which were mainly based on visual and smear-slide 326 \ndescriptions) by considering the new grain-size data and summarize the main 327 \ncharacteristics of the lithological units from core base to core top (Figs. 2, 3). 328 \nThe lower lithological unit at sites GC352, GC362, GC365, GC366 and 329 \nGC368 comprises 0.45-2.1 m thick, terrigenous, olive grey to dark brown, 330 \nmassive gravelly diamictons, which we had originally described as gravelly 331 \nsandy muds (Hillenbrand et al., 2009), and structureless to slightly stratified 332 \n14 \nmuddy diamictons with low to medium shear strength values (\u226412 kPa; Fig. 2). 333 \nCores GC357, GC359, GC360, GC370, GC371, GC374, PS2533-2, PS2542-334 \n2 and PS2543-1 recovered 0.80-1.65 m thick, grey, terrigenous, mainly 335 \nmassive and occasionally crudely stratified muddy diamictons at their bases, 336 \nwhich are distinct by their medium to high shear strength values (\u226435 kPa) 337 \n(Fig. 2; Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009). Shear planes were identified in the 338 \nmuddy diamictons of cores GC359 (at 110 cm below seafloor [cmbsf]) and 339 \nGC374 (at 181 cmbsf; see Fig. 3). The lower lithological unit at site GC372 340 \nconsists of a massive muddy diamicton with medium shear strength values 341 \noverlain by a structureless to moderately stratified gravelly diamicton with high 342 \nshear strength values. 343 \nAt all sites apart from GC365, the lower lithological unit is overlain by a 0.15-344 \n1.10 m thick middle lithological unit that consists of structureless to slightly 345 \nlaminated or crudely stratified, but rarely bioturbated, gravelly sandy muds 346 \n(Figs. 2, 3). Initially, we had classified these sediments as sandy muds and 347 \nmuddy sands (Hillenbrand et al., 2009), but the grain-size data reveal also a 348 \nsignificant concentration of gravel grains in this unit (Fig. 2). The middle 349 \nlithological unit is mainly terrigenous. Only occasionally does its top part 350 \ncontain microfossils, for example at site GC368. A soft-sediment clast of 351 \nfaintly laminated mud is observed in the middle lithological unit of core GC362 352 \n(Fig. 3). 353 \nThe upper lithological unit comprises the near-surface sediments and consists 354 \nof ~0.20-0.80 m thick, olive to brownish, diatom-bearing to diatomaceous 355 \nmuds with low concentrations of iceberg-rafted debris (IRD) on the inner shelf 356 \n(Figs. 2, 3; Supplementary Figure 1a). The upper lithological unit on the 357 \n15 \nmiddle to outer shelf and at site GC352 from just beyond the shelf edge 358 \nconsists of ~0.02-0.15 m thick, brown, foraminifera-bearing to foraminiferal 359 \nmuds (Figs. 2, 3; Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009) with manganese-coated, 360 \ngravel- to pebble-sized IRD often scattered on the core surfaces 361 \n(Supplementary Figure 1b). The upper lithological unit is mainly bioturbated or 362 \nhomogenous. Crude stratification is only observed in core GC358 (Fig. 2). 363 \n3.2. Physical properties 364 \nThe lower lithological unit is characterised by relatively constant values of 365 \nmagnetic susceptibility (MS), wet-bulk density (WBD) and water content (Fig. 366 \n2). The shear strength and, to a lesser extent, the WBD often decrease up-367 \ncore in the gravelly and muddy diamictons, while the water content slightly 368 \nincreases. In most cores, shear strength, MS and WBD reach maximum 369 \nvalues and water content reaches a minimum within the lower lithological unit. 370 \nDiscrete peaks in the physical properties of the diamictons are associated with 371 \nlarger cobbles and pebbles. In the middle lithological unit water content, MS 372 \nand WBD show higher variability than in the other units (Fig. 2). At sites 373 \nGC359, GC360, GC362 and GC366 on the inner shelf the MS reaches 374 \nmaxima within the gravelly sandy muds, and at sites GC359 and GC362 also 375 \nthe WBD shows maximum values. Water content often increases up-core into 376 \nthe biogenic muds of the upper lithological unit, whereas MS, shear strength 377 \nand WBD decrease. The diatom- and foraminifera-bearing sediments are 378 \ncharacterised by low values of MS, shear strength and WBD that coincide with 379 \nhigh water contents (Fig. 2). 380 \n3.3. Grain-size distribution and clay mineral assemblages 381 \nThe gravelly diamictons of the lower lithological unit usually contain 10-50 382 \n16 \nwt.% gravel, 20-35 wt.% sand and 30-55 wt.% clayey silt, while the muddy 383 \ndiamictons contain <15 wt.% gravel, 20-40 wt.% sand and 55-75 wt.% clayey 384 \nsilt (Fig. 2). In the middle lithological unit sand contents are 10-45 wt.% and 385 \ngravel contents are generally 2-15 wt.%, with gravel maxima (\u226450 wt.%) 386 \noccurring at sites GC359 and GC362 on the inner shelf (Fig. 2). The 387 \nsediments of the upper lithological unit are dominated by clayey silt with sand 388 \ncontents usually <40 wt.% (Fig. 2). Significant gravel concentrations (5-30 389 \nwt.%) are only observed at sites GC360 and GC362 on the inner shelf and 390 \nsites GC372 and GC374 on the outer shelf. The sand-silt-clay data reveal that 391 \nsurface sediments on the inner shelf are dominated by silty clay and clayey 392 \nsilt with only low contents of sand (Fig. 4). Sand content generally increases 393 \noceanwards, with the highest concentrations occurring on the outer shelf and 394 \nthe upper continental slope. Contents of sand-sized calcareous foraminifera 395 \ntests are also higher on the outer shelf and beyond the shelf break. However, 396 \n,the seaward increase in sand contents of decalcified samples documents that 397 \nthis increase is at least partly caused by higher concentrations of terrigenous 398 \nsand particles because the corresponding sediments lack other non-399 \ncalcareous sand-sized microfossils, such as radiolarians (cf. Hillenbrand et al., 400 \n2003). The silt-clay ratios show large variabilities down-core (Fig. 2). At sites 401 \nGC366, GC372 and GC374 they tend to be lower in the near-surface 402 \nsediments and reach maximum values in the diamictons of the lower 403 \nlithological unit. 404 \nWe previously reported the geographical distribution and the down-core 405 \nvariations of the clay mineral assemblages in the southern Bellingshausen 406 \nSea (Hillenbrand et al., 2003, 2005, 2009). The clay minerals comprise mainly 407 \n17 \nsmectite, illite and chlorite and only minor contents of kaolinite. Their down-408 \ncore variations predominantly reflect the major lithological changes (Fig. 2). 409 \n3.4. Contents of inorganic and organic carbon and Corg\/Ntot ratios 410 \nWithin the lower lithological unit, the Corg and CaCO3 contents are remarkably 411 \nconstant and range mainly from 0.05 to 0.25 wt.% and 0.3 to 2 wt.%, 412 \nrespectively (Fig. 2). The muddy diamictons generally contain more Corg than 413 \nthe gravelly diamictons (e.g. GC372), and the muddy diamicton of core 414 \nGC360 shows a CaCO3 maximum in its upper part. The Corg\/Ntot ratiosare <10 415 \nin the muddy diamicton of core GC352 from the uppermost continental slope 416 \nand in the gravelly diamictons of cores GC362, GC365 and GC366 from the 417 \ninner shelf west of Smyley Island (Fig. 2). They vary mainly between 10 and 418 \n30 in the diamictons at the other core sites (Fig. 2). Corg\/Ntot ratios of marine 419 \norganisms typically range from ~4 to ~10 and those in terrestrial plants from 420 \n~12 to ~45 (e.g. Meyers, 1997; Lamb et al., 2006). Corg\/Ntot ratios up to 30 421 \nhave been reported from Holocene Antarctic shelf sediments and were 422 \nattributed to enhanced supply of terrestrial organic material or (lipid-rich) 423 \norganic matter from marine benthic algae in combination with limited nitrogen 424 \navailability under sea-ice cover (e.g. Yoon et al., 2000, 2010; McMinn et al., 425 \n2001; Presti et al., 2003). Inorganic nitrogen is likely to contribute to the low 426 \nCorg\/Ntot ratios in the gravelly diamictons at sites GC362, GC365 and GC366, 427 \nbecause these sediments are characterised by the highest illite contents in the 428 \nstudy area (Fig. 2). Illite is well known to contain more inorganic-fixed nitrogen 429 \nthan other clay minerals (e.g. De Lange, 1992). 430 \nThe Corg content in the middle lithological unit is generally 0.05-0.20 wt.%, but 431 \nshows minimum values (compared to the other units) at all sites. Apart from 432 \n18 \nsites GC359 and GC362, the CaCO3 content in this unit is <1 wt.% and also 433 \nat its minimum. The Corg\/Ntot ratios in the middle lithological unit are similar to 434 \nthose of the lower unit, but often decrease towards the top of the unit (Fig. 2). 435 \nWithin the upper lithological unit the Corg contents increase towards the 436 \nsurface, with the diatom-bearing sediments on the inner shelf exhibiting the 437 \nhighest Corg contents. A similar pattern is observed in the CaCO3 contents of 438 \nthe foraminifera-bearing sediments from the middle to outer shelf and beyond 439 \nthe shelf edge (Fig. 2; cf. Hillenbrand et al., 2003, 2005). Here, the CaCO3 440 \ncontents mainly reflect the concentrations of N. pachyderma sin. tests. At 441 \nmost core sites the Corg\/Ntot ratios are \u226410 in the upper lithological unit and 442 \nthus exhibit a relative minimum when compared to the Corg\/Ntot ratios of the 443 \nother units. 444 \nThe seafloor surface sediments contain 0.1-0.7 wt.% Corg, with the highest 445 \nvalues (0.3-0.7 wt.%) observed on the inner shelf (Fig. 4; cf. Hillenbrand et al., 446 \n2003). The CaCO3 contents are 0.3-2.1 wt.% on the inner shelf and range 447 \nfrom 15.1 to 18.1 wt.% on the middle and outer shelf in Belgica Trough, and 448 \nfrom 5.5 to 8.4 wt.% on the outer shelf beyond the trough. The highest CaCO3 449 \ncontent of 46.6 wt.% was found on the upper continental slope (Fig. 4). Thus, 450 \nthe geographical pattern of the CaCO3 contents resembles that of the sand 451 \ncontents (cf. Hillenbrand et al., 2003). 452 \n3.5. Stable isotopic composition of planktonic foraminifera tests 453 \nOnly the near-surface sediments from the middle and outer shelf and 454 \nuppermost slope contained enough calcareous foraminifera to analyse the 455 \n18O and 13C composition of their tests. The 18O signal in the gravity cores 456 \nfrom the shelf varies less than 0.15\u2030 around an average value of ~3.45\u2030 457 \n19 \nand shows only a minor down-core increase at sites GC368, GC370 and 458 \nGC372 (Fig. 5a). In multiple core PS2543-3 the 18O signal is relatively 459 \nconstant, too, but varies around a lower average value of ~3.1\u2030. Taking into 460 \naccount the consistent down-core pattern at all shelf sites, we consider the 461 \n18O offset of ~0.35\u2030 in core PS2543-3 to be a methodological artefact (the 462 \n18O values for this core were analysed in a different laboratory with a 463 \ndifferent mass spectrometer, see section 2). Also core GC352 shows only 464 \nminor 18O variations around a mean value of ~3.45\u2030, but its lowermost 465 \nsample exhibits a 18O value of 3.9\u2030, the heaviest 18O value measured at 466 \nany of the sites (Fig. 5a). The near-surface 13C values range from 1.1-1.2\u2030 467 \nand decrease down-core by ~0.3-0.5\u2030 to a sub-surface minimum at all sites 468 \n(Fig. 5b). In cores GC370, GC371, PS2543-3 and GC372 the 13C values 469 \nshow a slight increase below this minimum. 470 \n3.6. Excess 210Pb activity 471 \nSub-core BC364X was taken from site GC365 on the inner shelf in Eltanin 472 \nBay and shows a reasonably high excess 210Pb activity of 283 Bq\/kg at the 473 \ncore top (Fig. 6). Non-local mixing caused by bioturbation is evident at a depth 474 \nfrom 6-9 cmbsf, and also affects the lowermost interval of the excess 210Pb 475 \nprofile. Sub-core BC369Y was recovered from site GC368 on the middle shelf 476 \nin Belgica Trough and exhibits a classic decay profile with a very high excess 477 \n210Pb activity of 466 Bq\/kg at the surface (Fig. 6). Sediment mixing by 478 \nbioturbation is very minor and mainly affects the lower part of the profile. In 479 \nsub-core BC373Y, which was collected from site GC372 on the outer shelf in 480 \nBelgica Trough, excess 210Pb activity is just 85 Bq\/kg at the surface and could 481 \nonly be detected down to 5 cmbsf depth (Fig. 6). This indicates condensed 482 \n20 \nsedimentation and possibly a lack of modern sediments at the core top. 483 \n3.7. Radiocarbon dates 484 \n3.7.1. AMS 14C ages of seafloor surface sediments 485 \nIn the surface sediments, the uncorrected AMS 14C ages of calcareous 486 \n(micro-)fossils increase from ~1.3 ka B.P. on the inner shelf to ~1.9 ka B.P. on 487 \nthe middle shelf and ~2.5-3.4 ka B.P. on the outer shelf (Table 1; Figs. 4, 6). 488 \nThe oldest surface 14C age of 6.6 ka B.P. was obtained from foraminifera tests 489 \nat site BC355 located just beyond the shelf edge. The seaward increase of 490 \n14C ages resembles the spatial pattern observed in the sand and CaCO3 491 \ncontents. The uncorrected AMS 14C ages of the AIO in the surface sediments 492 \nrange from ~3.9-5.1 ka B.P. on the inner shelf, ~6.1-6.4 ka B.P. on the middle 493 \nshelf, and ~3.8-4.5 ka B.P. on the outer shelf (Table 1; Figs. 4, 6). The AIO 494 \nages are consistently older than the 14C ages obtained from the calcareous 495 \nmaterial, which we attribute to the contamination of the organic carbon with 496 \nrecycled, fossil organic matter. 497 \n3.7.2. AMS 14C down-core ages 498 \nUncorrected AMS 14C ages obtained from calcareous foraminifera in the 499 \nupper lithological unit and the top part of the middle lithological unit vary 500 \nbetween 3.7 ka B.P. at site GC371 and 6.1 ka B.P. at site BC369\/GC368, with 501 \nthe corresponding corrected ages ranging from 2.4 ka B.P. to 4.8 ka B.P. 502 \n(Table 1; Figs. 2, 7). Uncorrected AMS 14C ages of AIO samples from the 503 \nbasal part of the upper lithological unit vary between 8.4 ka B.P. at site GC360 504 \nand 21.4 ka B.P. at site GC358, corresponding to corrected ages of 4.0 ka 505 \nB.P. and 16.3 ka B.P., respectively. The uncorrected AMS 14C ages of AIO 506 \nsamples from the basal part of the middle lithological unit range from 23.6 ka 507 \n21 \nB.P. at site GC360 to 34.9 ka B.P. at site GC359, while the corrected AIO 508 \nages vary between 19.1 ka B.P. at site GC360 and 31.5 ka B.P. at site 509 \nGC374. The uncorrected AIO dates from the lower lithological unit span 22.5 510 \nka B.P. at site GC371 to 41.8 ka B.P. at site GC357, while the corrected AIO 511 \nages from this unit vary between 20.0 ka B.P. at site GC371 and 38.8 ka B.P. 512 \nat site GC372. The only age reversals are observed in the middle and lower 513 \nlithological units of core GC371. At most core sites, the corrected AMS 14C 514 \nages from the top part of the middle lithological unit are significantly younger 515 \nthan those from its basal part (Fig. 2), which is reflected by a corresponding 516 \nkink in age-depth profiles for the cores (Fig. 7). These profiles illustrate that 517 \nthe 14C age increase from the top part of the middle lithological unit into its 518 \nbasal part is more pronounced than the 14C age increase into the underlying 519 \ndiamictons. 520 \n3.7.3. AIO radiocarbon dates and their relation to Corg content and \n13Corg 521 \ncomposition of the organic matter  522 \nIn addition to their different depositional ages, the 14C dates obtained from the 523 \nAIO may be affected by significant changes in i) the Corg content of the 524 \nsediments and ii) the origin of the dated organic material (cf. Licht et al., 1998; 525 \nLicht & Andrews, 2002; Ohkouchi & Eglinton, 2006). A low Corg content may 526 \nresult from a low supply of fresh organic carbon and a dominance of 527 \nreworked, fossil organic matter, which would offset the AIO 14C date towards 528 \nan older age. Enhanced supply of reworked, fossil terrestrial organic 529 \nsubstance may be identified by a Corg\/Ntot ratio >12 and a strongly depleted 530 \n13Corg ratio (e.g. Meyers, 1997; Lamb et al., 2006). 531 \nThe Corg contents of the dated samples from the southern Bellingshausen Sea 532 \n22 \nshelf range from 0.04 to 0.70 wt.% (Table 1). In general, the samples with low 533 \nCorg contents have older AIO \n14C ages (Fig. 8a). However, these samples 534 \nwere taken from the gravelly sandy muds and diamictons, i.e. from sediments 535 \nthat are stratigraphically older and have a mainly terrigenous composition 536 \n(Fig. 2). Among samples taken exclusively from mainly terrigenous sediments 537 \nno systematic relationship between AIO 14C ages and Corg contents is evident 538 \n(Fig. 8a). The same applies to samples exclusively taken from diatom- and 539 \nforaminifera-bearing sediments of the upper lithological unit (Fig. 8a). 540 \nThe Corg\/Ntot ratios in most diamictons and the lower part of the gravelly sandy 541 \nmuds exceed 10 and thus are relatively high (Fig. 2). However, it remains 542 \nunclear, if these high ratios result from enhanced supply of fossil, terrestrial 543 \nplant material or marine benthic algal material in combination with nitrogen 544 \nlimitation caused by ice coverage (see section 3.4.). The 13Corg ratios of the 545 \nradiocarbon-dated organic material from the southern Bellingshausen Sea 546 \nvary mainly between -23.7\u2030 and -26.5\u2030 (Table 1; Fig. 8b). Only in core 547 \nGC359 the two lowermost samples taken from the lower and the middle 548 \nlithological unit exhibit strongly depleted 13Corg ratios of -29.2\u2030 and -28.4\u2030, 549 \nrespectively. With the exception of site GC359, the down-core variability of the 550 \n13Corg values at the core sites is \u22641.1\u2030 (Table 1), which is comparable or 551 \nless than at core sites from other parts of the Antarctic shelf (e.g. Harden et 552 \nal., 1992; Domack et al., 1998, 1999, 2001; Licht & Andrews, 2002; \u00d3 Cofaigh 553 \net al., 2005a; Pudsey et al., 2006; Hemer et al., 2007; McKay et al., 2008; 554 \nHillenbrand et al., 2010). The 13Corg composition of marine particulate organic 555 \nsubstance typically ranges from -18\u2030 to -27\u2030 (e.g. Harden et al., 1992; 556 \nMeyers, 1997; Lamb et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2006). More depleted 13Corg 557 \n23 \nvalues down to -29.4\u2030 were reported for the organic material in sediments 558 \nfrom the Ross Sea shelf (Andrews et al., 1999; Domack et al., 1999). These 559 \nvery low 13Corg values are attributed to the occurrence of the prymnesiophyte 560 \nPhaeocystis antarctica (Ohkouchi & Eglinton, 2006), which is a major 561 \nphytoplankton primary producer in the Ross Sea and around the Antarctic 562 \nPeninsula (e.g. Abelmann et al., 2006). With the exception of the two 13Corg-563 \ndepleted samples from core GC359, the 13Corg ratios in the samples from the 564 \nsouthern Bellingshausen Sea shelf suggest that the radiocarbon-dated 565 \norganic matter is predominantly of marine origin. Importantly, no obvious 566 \nsystematic link exists between the uncorrected AIO 14C dates and the 13Corg 567 \nratios of the organic substance, if the two samples from core GC359 are not 568 \nconsidered (Fig. 8b). 569 \n4. DISCUSSION 570 \n4.1. Sedimentary facies and depositional environments 571 \n4.1.1. Subglacial facies and proximal grounding-line facies 572 \nWe have previously classified the sediments of the lower lithological unit as 573 \nsubglacial soft tills (GC357, GC359, GC360, GC362, GC368, GC370, GC372, 574 \nGC374), sub-ice shelf diamictons (GC357, GC359, GC360, GC362, GC365, 575 \nGC366, GC368, GC370, GC372, GC374), glaciogenic debris flows (GC352, 576 \nGC365, GC366), iceberg-rafted diamictons (GC362, GC365, GC366, GC368) 577 \nand iceberg turbate (GC371), respectively, mainly based on their continuously 578 \nterrigenous and coarse-grained lithology, shear strength values and 579 \nhomogenous clay mineral composition (Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009). Here, 580 \nwe refine this classification by taking into account the additional physical 581 \n24 \nproperties and grain-size data and the sedimentary structures (Table 2). Our 582 \ninterpretations are largely consistent with published facies classifications from 583 \nelsewhere on the Antarctic shelf (e.g. Kurtz & Anderson, 1979; Anderson et 584 \nal., 1980; Wright & Anderson, 1982; Licht et al., 1996, 1998, 1999; Domack et 585 \nal., 1998, 1999, 2005; Anderson, 1999; Pudsey & Evans, 2001; Wellner et al., 586 \n2001; Evans & Pudsey, 2002; Brachfeld et al., 2003; Evans et al., 2005; 587 \nHeroy & Anderson, 2005; Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2010; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 588 \n2005a; Mosola & Anderson, 2006; Pudsey et al., 2006; McKay et al., 2008; 589 \nSmith et al., 2009). 590 \nWe interpret muddy diamictons of the lower lithological unit, which are 591 \ncharacterised by medium to high shear strength values, low CaCO3 contents 592 \nand only minor fluctuations in MS, water content, WBD and grain-size 593 \ncomposition, as subglacial soft tills (ST) deposited at the base of the ice 594 \nstream that had advanced through Belgica Trough (Table 2, Fig. 2). For cores 595 \nGC359 and GC374, this interpretation is corroborated by the observed shear 596 \nplanes (Fig. 3) that resemble structures reported from soft tills on the western 597 \nand eastern Antarctic Peninsula shelf (\u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005a, 2007; Evans et 598 \nal., 2005). In contrast, we assign muddy diamictons, which do not fulfil these 599 \ncriteria and overly the soft tills (Table 2, Fig. 2), to a sub-ice shelf setting (SIS) 600 \nnear the grounding line of the retreating ice stream. In such a depositional 601 \nenvironment sediment is mainly delivered by melt-out of basal debris near the 602 \ngrounding line with minor advection of fine-grained particles by ocean 603 \ncurrents. Variability in sediment supply and current-induced sorting is reflected 604 \nin the muddy diamictons of our cores by the variability of physical properties 605 \nand grain-size composition (cf. Domack et al., 1998, 1999; Licht et al., 1999; 606 \n25 \nEvans & Pudsey, 2002; Hillenbrand et al., 2005). In the upper muddy 607 \ndiamicton of core GC374 we observe a stratified interval (Fig. 2), which is 608 \nconsidered to be characteristic for glaciomarine diamictons (e.g. Domack et 609 \nal., 1998; Licht et al., 1999; Evans & Pudsey, 2002; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005a, 610 \n2008). 611 \nThe only exceptions in the assignment of muddy diamictons with low to 612 \nmedium shear strength to a proximal sub-ice shelf setting are cores GC352 613 \nand GC371 (Fig. 2). Core GC352 was recovered from a water depth of 718 m 614 \njust beyond the shelf break. We therefore interpret its muddy diamicton as a 615 \nglaciogenic debris flow (GDF) and iceberg-rafted sediment (IS), respectively 616 \n(Table 2). The debris flow was deposited, when subglacial debris released at 617 \nthe grounding line of the ice stream in Belgica Trough was redeposited down-618 \nslope (Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009; Dowdeswell et al., 2008a). Core GC371 619 \nwas collected from an iceberg-furrowed area in outer Belgica Trough (\u00d3 620 \nCofaigh et al., 2005b). Therefore, we interpret the upper diamicton at this site 621 \nas an iceberg turbate (IT), while we classify the lower diamicton as a soft till 622 \n(Table 2). Our interpretation is supported by the inverse radiocarbon 623 \nstratigraphy at site GC371 (Table 1, Fig. 2). 624 \nThe lower lithological unit at several sites, mainly from the inner shelf, 625 \ncomprises gravelly diamictons with variable, in most cases low to medium 626 \nshear strength values (Fig. 2). We classify the gravelly diamictons at sites 627 \nGC365, GC366, GC368 and GC372 as proximal grounding-line sub-ice shelf 628 \nsediments (SIS prox), because they also show variable MS, WBD and water 629 \ncontents (Table 2; cf. Domack et al., 1999; Evans et al., 2005). Core GC365 630 \nfrom Eltanin Bay additionally bears gravelly diamicton with relatively constant 631 \n26 \nWBD and MS values at its base. The clay mineralogical signature of this lower 632 \ngravelly diamicton differs from that in the upper gravelly diamicton by the 633 \npresence of smectite, and thus resembles the clay mineral assemblage of the 634 \nupper lithological unit (Fig. 2), which suggests sediment supply from various, 635 \nmore distal sources (cf. Hillenbrand et al., 2009). Therefore, we interpret the 636 \nlower gravelly diamicton at site GC365 as iceberg-rafted sediment (IS; Table 637 \n2). The same interpretation is preferred for the gravelly diamicton at site 638 \nGC362, which is also characterised by relatively constant WBD and MS 639 \nvalues. 640 \nThe CaCO3 content in the lower lithological unit is ~1 wt.%, while the Corg 641 \ncontent ranges from ~0.05-0.10 wt.% in the gravelly diamictons to 0.10-0.25 642 \nwt.% in the muddy diamictons. Assuming that both the organic and inorganic 643 \ncarbon is of biogenic origin, the significant Corg and CaCO3 concentrations in 644 \nthe diamictons suggest considerable subglacial reworking of older interglacial 645 \nshelf sediments (cf. Domack et al., 1999) and\/or fossil biogenic sedimentary 646 \nstrata (cf. Nishimura et al., 1999; Pudsey & Evans, 2001). This detritus was 647 \napparently incorporated into the till at the base of the ice stream and the 648 \nderived proglacial sediments. 649 \n4.1.2. Distal sub-ice shelf\/sub-sea ice facies 650 \nThe predominantly terrigenous composition, the general lack of bioturbation 651 \nand the high variability of grain-size composition and physical properties in the 652 \nmiddle lithological unit (Fig. 2) indicate its deposition in a glaciomarine 653 \nenvironment under an ice shelf distal from the grounding line or under 654 \npermanent sea-ice coverage (cf. Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009). This 655 \ninterpretation is in agreement with the relatively high Corg\/Ntot ratios of this unit, 656 \n27 \nwhich may result from nitrogen limitation in response to ice cover (e.g. 657 \nMcMinn et al., 2001; Yoon et al., 2010). In cores GC358, GC359, GC360, 658 \nGC362, GC370, GC371, GC372 and PS2533-2 the increasing influence of 659 \nseasonal open-water conditions towards the top of the gravelly sandy mud is 660 \nreflected by an increase of Corg and\/or CaCO3 concentrations, the onset of 661 \nbioturbation and\/or the increase of silt and clay contents (Fig. 2; Hillenbrand et 662 \nal., 2005). At sites GC357, GC359, GC360, GC368, GC370, GC372 and 663 \nGC374 the transition to more open-marine conditions is also suggested by the 664 \ndrop of the Corg\/Ntot ratios to values \u226410 towards the top of the gravelly sandy 665 \nmud unit (Fig. 2), because such ratios are typical for marine phytoplankton 666 \nproduction in open water (e.g. Meyers, 1997; Lamb et al., 2006). 667 \nAt site GC359 the lower part of the middle lithological unit differs from the 668 \nupper part by maxima in gravel content and MS, high WBD variability, a 669 \nminimum in water content and a stratified interval (Fig. 2). Therefore, we 670 \nassign this lower part of the gravelly sandy mud to a more proximal sub-ice 671 \nshelf setting. In core GC362 the middle lithological unit is expanded, shows a 672 \nhigh variability of MS, WBD, water content and gravel content (Fig. 2) and 673 \ncontains a mud clast (Fig. 3). Also these characteristics point to a depositional 674 \nsetting in relative proximity to the grounding line. The middle lithological unit at 675 \nsite GC371 exhibits an inverse 14C stratigraphy (Table 1) suggesting that the 676 \ngravelly sandy mud is part of the iceberg-turbated sequence (Fig. 2). The 677 \npresent water depth at site GC371 is 595 m, corresponding to an LGM water 678 \ndepth of ~465 m (assuming no significant glacio-isostatic depression of the 679 \nouter shelf). The modern maximum iceberg-keel depth in the study area is 680 \nonly ~150-200 m (Ferrigno et al., 1998; Dowdeswell & Bamber, 2007). Thus, 681 \n28 \nthe iceberg scouring near site GC371 is more likely to have occurred during 682 \nthe last deglaciation, when the APIS and the WAIS calved much larger 683 \nicebergs. 684 \nThe middle lithological unit was apparently deposited during the transition 685 \nfrom a subglacial\/proximal grounding-line setting to a seasonal open-marine 686 \nenvironment (cf. Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009). This transition is particularly 687 \nevident from the clay mineral assemblages (Fig. 2). At most sites (GC352, 688 \nGC359, GC368, GC370, GC372, GC374, PS2533-2; Fig. 2, Hillenbrand et al., 689 \n2005, 2009) the clay mineral composition of the middle lithological unit 690 \nchanges from an assemblage resembling that of the underlying diamictons to 691 \nan assemblage similar to that of the overlying foraminifera- or diatom-bearing 692 \nmuds. In some cores, however, the clay mineral assemblage of the gravelly 693 \nsandy muds is rather distinct (e.g. GC357, GC360, GC362, GC371, PS2542-694 \n2; Fig. 2, Hillenbrand et al., 2009), which we attribute to the time-transgressive 695 \ndeglaciation of the various source areas for the clay mineral assemblages (for 696 \ndetails see Fig. 15 in Hillenbrand et al., 2009). 697 \n4.1.3. Seasonal open-marine facies 698 \nWe previously classified the upper lithological unit as a seasonal open-marine 699 \nfacies based on its microfossil content, its bioturbation and its mixed clay 700 \nmineralogical composition (Hillenbrand et al., 2005, 2009). Such a 701 \nglaciomarine setting, which prevails in the southern Bellingshausen Sea 702 \ntoday, is characterised by deposition of terrigenous detritus supplied by 703 \nicebergs and tidal- and wind-driven currents from a relatively wide source area 704 \nin the West Antarctic hinterland and of planktonic microfossils, such as 705 \ndiatoms and foraminifera (cf. Hillenbrand et al., 2003, 2005, 2009). The 706 \n29 \nelevated Corg concentrations of the upper lithological unit across the shelf, 707 \ntogether with the high CaCO3 contents at sites on the middle to outer shelf 708 \nand from beyond the shelf break (Figs. 2, 4), support the interpretation of the 709 \nupper lithological unit as a seasonal open-marine facies. 710 \nThe highest Corg contents occur in the upper lithological unit of cores located 711 \nin the southern part of the study area. This geographical pattern probably 712 \nresults from i) high sedimentation rates at these core sites, which are 713 \nindicated by the young uncorrected 14C ages obtained from the calcareous 714 \n(micro-)fossils and\/or the high excess 210Pb concentrations in the surface 715 \nsediments (Figs. 4, 6), ii) significant concentrations of diatoms in the 716 \nsediments on the inner shelf, and iii) high mud contents at those core sites 717 \n(>80 wt.%; Fig. 2). Higher sedimentation rates may be the most important 718 \nfactor because they favour the preservation of both Corg and diatom frustules 719 \n(e.g. DeMaster et al., 1996). Diatom frustules contain large amounts of 720 \norganic matter and are mainly silt sized, i.e. they may also contribute to a fine 721 \ngrain-size of the sediment. 722 \nThe observed seaward increase of calcareous foraminifera, CaCO3 and 723 \nterrigenous sand contents in the surface sediments, which coincides with an 724 \nseaward increase of the 14C ages of calcareous (micro-)fossils (Fig. 4), 725 \nprobably results from sediment condensation and\/or non-deposition on the 726 \nmiddle-outer shelf and the upper continental slope in response to current-727 \ninduced winnowing (cf. Hillenbrand et al., 2003). We have assumed that the 728 \nregional MRE is given by the conventional 14C age of 1,294 yrs B.P. obtained 729 \nfrom a scaphopod at site BC364\/GC365 in Eltanin Bay (see section 2). This 730 \nassumption is validated by the high excess 210Pb concentration at site BC364 731 \n30 \nindicating modern sedimentation (Fig. 6). On the middle shelf, the 14C ages 732 \nobtained from planktonic foraminifera exceed the regional MRE by ~600 years 733 \n(Fig. 4). However, the excess 210Pb profile at site BC369\/GC368 indicates 734 \nmodern sedimentation (Fig. 6) on the middle shelf. Therefore, we attribute the 735 \nslightly older 14C ages to a condensation effect (about 1,000-2,000 736 \nforaminifera tests per sample were picked for radiocarbon dating, and the 737 \ntests from the base of this 1 cm-thick sample are likely to be older than those 738 \nfrom the top of the sample). The foraminiferal 14C ages from the outer shelf 739 \nand upper slope exceed the MRE even more, by ~2,000-5,300 yrs (Fig. 4). 740 \nHowever, the excess 210Pb profile at site BC373\/GC372 (Fig. 6) suggests that 741 \nthese old 14C ages of the seabed surface are caused by sediment 742 \ncondensation rather than by non-deposition or erosion. Condensation caused 743 \nby winnowing is also indicated by the high abundance of manganese-coated, 744 \ncoarse-grained IRD on the outer shelf (Supplementary Figure 1b), because 745 \nformation of manganese crusts requires sedimentation rates of \u22641 mm\/ka 746 \n(e.g. Roy, 1981). 747 \nBecause the Antarctic Slope Front is not present in the study area, the only 748 \ngeostrophic current that may have reduced the sedimentation rates on the 749 \nmiddle-outer shelf and the upper continental slope by winnowing is a current 750 \nassociated with the SBACC. The SBACC, which runs along the shelf break 751 \ntoday, may have repeatedly swept onto the shelf of the southern 752 \nBellingshausen Sea during the last few thousand years (cf. Hillenbrand et al., 753 \n2003). Such southward shifts of the SBACC would also have advected more 754 \nCDW onto the shelf (e.g. Walker et al., 2007), which may have resulted in 755 \nenhanced oceanic melting of ice shelves and glaciers along the coast (cf. 756 \n31 \nJacobs et al., 1996). The location of the SBACC may actually be constrained 757 \nby the shelf break itself (Orsi et al., 1995; Jenkins & Jacobs, 2008). Similar as 758 \nin the Amundsen Sea embayment (Thoma et al. 2008), seasonal changes in 759 \nthe wind system may have caused stronger deep-water advection onto the 760 \nshelf of the southern Bellingshausen Sea and thus winnowing of the 761 \nsediments. 762 \n4.2. Reconstruction of the ice-sheet history on the southern 763 \nBellingshausen Sea shelf 764 \nAll 14C dates mentioned in this section, including those taken from the 765 \nliterature, are reported as corrected, uncalibrated 14C ages. The two oldest 766 \nAIO 14C dates from core GC359 are not considered because of the extremely 767 \ndepleted 13Corg ratios of the organic matter in the corresponding samples, 768 \nwhich may indicate extremely high contamination with fossil carbon (see 769 \nsection 3.7.3.). 770 \n4.2.1. Timing of ice-sheet advance 771 \nWe have obtained AIO 14C ages from the subglacial tills (GC357, GC372) and 772 \nthe proximal-grounding line diamictons (GC372, GC374). The corrected ages 773 \nfrom the soft tills range from 38.8 ka B.P. (GC372) to 36.0 ka. B.P. (GC357), 774 \nwhile those from the sub-ice shelf diamictons have similar or slightly younger 775 \nages between 37.7 ka B.P. (GC374) and 32.7 ka B.P. (GC372) (Table 1, Fig. 776 \n2). The 14C dates from the subglacial diamictons have to be considered as 777 \nmaximum ages for the ice-sheet advance across the shelf, because the ice 778 \nprobably eroded older, interglacial shelf sediments at its base and 779 \nincorporated their organic matter into the till (cf. Domack et al, 1999; Licht et 780 \nal., 1996, 1999; Heroy & Anderson, 2007). Subglacial recycling of fossil 781 \n32 \nbiogenic material is indicated for the tills from the southern Bellingshausen 782 \nSea by both their Corg contents (and possibly also their CaCO3 contents; Fig. 783 \n2) and their high Corg\/Ntot ratios. Reworking of old sedimentary detritus into the 784 \ndiamictons is also evident from their clay mineral composition (see 785 \nHillenbrand et al, 2009). At each core site the clay mineral assemblage of the 786 \nsoft till and the overlying proximal grounding-line diamicton is very similar 787 \n(Figs. 2, 9; Hillenbrand et al, 2009), which may also explain their similar AIO 788 \nradiocarbon ages. We attribute the relatively young 14C age of the sub-ice 789 \nshelf diamicton at site GC372 to the dilution of the old, reworked organic 790 \nmatter with some fresh organic carbon advected from open-water areas 791 \nbeyond the ice-shelf front into the ice-shelf cavity (cf. Domack et al., 1999; 792 \nLicht et al., 1996, 1999; Hemer et al., 2007). 793 \nWe conclude that the last ice-stream advance through Belgica Trough must 794 \nhave occurred after 36.0 ka B.P. and possibly later than 32.7 ka B.P.. These 795 \nages pre-date corrected 14C ages for the advance of the APIS across the 796 \nouter shelf west of the Antarctic Peninsula (~15.5 ka B.P., Nishimura et al., 797 \n1999) and of the WAIS across the outer shelf of the western Ross Sea (~27.0-798 \n26.5 ka B.P., Domack et al., 1999; Emslie et al., 2007), the inner shelf of the 799 \ncentral Ross Sea (~17.8 ka B.P., Licht & Andrews, 2002) and the outer shelf 800 \nof the central-eastern Ross Sea (~21.0 ka B.P., Mosola & Anderson, 2006; 801 \n~13.8 ka B.P., Licht & Andrews, 2002). 802 \n4.2.2. History of ice-sheet retreat 803 \nThe time of the post-LGM ice-sheet retreat from the Antarctic shelf is often 804 \ndetermined by dating the base of the post-glacial biogenic sediments, i.e. by 805 \ndating the onset of seasonal open-marine sedimentation (e.g. Pudsey et al., 806 \n33 \n1994; Licht et al., 1996, 1999; Domack et al., 1999, 2001; Anderson et al., 807 \n2002; Licht & Andrews, 2002; Heroy & Anderson, 2005; Mosola & Anderson, 808 \n2006; McKay et al., 2008). These dates actually provide only minimum ages 809 \nfor ice-sheet retreat, but they are considered to be the most reliable 810 \nradiocarbon ages available. This is because the underlying terrigenous 811 \ntransitional sediments deposited more proximal to the retreating grounding 812 \nline usually lack calcareous microfossils, while the organic carbon contents in 813 \nthese transitional sediments are subject to significant contamination with 814 \nsubglacially reworked, fossil organic matter (e.g. Domack, 1992; Domack et 815 \nal., 1999; Heroy & Anderson, 2007; Rosenheim et al., 2008; Hillenbrand et al., 816 \n2010). In age-depth profiles for sediment cores, this higher degree of down-817 \ncore contamination is visible as a pronounced kink, sometimes referred to as 818 \na \"dog leg\" (Fig. 7 inset; e.g. Licht et al., 1998; Heroy & Anderson, 2007). 819 \nIn the cores from the middle and outer shelf of the southern Bellingshausen 820 \nSea the corrected 14C ages obtained from calcareous foraminifera tests are 821 \nnot older than 4.8 ka B.P., with the oldest age occurring at site BC369\/GC368 822 \non the middle shelf (Table 1, Fig. 2). These ages that mark the post-LGM 823 \nonset of biological productivity are very young and therefore unsuitable for 824 \nconstraining initial ice-sheet retreat in our study area. On the other hand, the 825 \ncorrected AIO 14C ages from the middle lithological unit, which comprises the 826 \ntransitional sediments deposited subsequent to grounding-line retreat, 827 \ndrastically increase down-core at most of the core sites (Table 1, Fig. 2) and 828 \napparently exhibit dog legs in age-depth profiles (Fig. 7). 829 \nIn order to evaluate the reliability of the AIO 14C ages for ice-stream retreat in 830 \nBelgica Trough we used the information about changes in sediment 831 \n34 \nprovenance provided by the changes in clay mineral assemblages (Fig. 2; 832 \nHillenbrand et al., 2009). We expect these changes in clay mineralogy to 833 \nreflect variations in the degree of contamination with fossil carbon and\/or in 834 \nthe age of the contaminating organic matter. We consider that the most 835 \nreliable down-core AIO 14C ages are those, which were obtained from 836 \nsediments with a clay mineral composition resembling that of the open-marine 837 \nsediments (Fig. 9). These ages are obtained either from the base of the 838 \nseasonal open-marine facies or the upper part of the distal sub-ice shelf\/sub-839 \nsea ice facies. The similarity in provenance of the corresponding samples may 840 \njustify the correction of their AIO 14C dates by simply subtracting the MRE and 841 \nthe LCO inferred from the seafloor surface sediments. In contrast, we expect 842 \nall dates from the base of the middle lithological unit to be unreliable, because 843 \nthey were obtained from sediments with a \"glacial\" provenance. As a 844 \nconsequence of changes in the ice-stream catchment and subglacial 845 \nreworking of older shelf sediments during the last glacial period (Hillenbrand 846 \net al., 2009), this provenance is different from the provenance of the Holocene 847 \nand modern sediments. Therefore, the dates from the base of the middle 848 \nlithological unit are likely to be overprinted by a higher contamination with 849 \nolder fossil carbon (Fig. 9). 850 \nFollowing this concept, we reconstructed the post-LGM ice-sheet retreat from 851 \nthe outer (sites GC374, GC372), middle (site GC368) and the inner shelf in 852 \nthe southern Bellingshausen Sea (sites GC357, GC360 and GC366) (Fig. 10). 853 \nAll these cores sites are located on palaeo-flow lines of ice feeding into and 854 \nflowing through Belgica Trough (see Fig. 1). In the samples that we consider 855 \nto provide the most reliable ages for ice-stream retreat (Fig. 2), the 13Corg 856 \n35 \nratios of the organic matter are \u2265-25.7\u2030 (Table 1). Apart from cores GC368 857 \nand GC372, the Corg\/Ntot ratios of the corresponding sediments are \u226410 (Fig. 858 \n2). Thus, the 13Corg and Corg\/Ntot ratios suggest a predominantly marine origin 859 \nof the dated organic material in most of the selected samples (see sections 860 \n3.4. and 3.7.3.). According to our chronology, the outer shelf deglaciated at 861 \n~25.5 ka B.P. and the grounding line of the ice stream then retreated slowly 862 \ntowards the mid-shelf, which was ice-free by ~19.8 ka B.P. (Fig. 10). 863 \nGrounding-line retreat towards the inner shelf in Eltanin Bay then continued at 864 \na similar rate, and site GC366 became ice-free at ~12.3 ka B.P.. The rate of 865 \nice retreat from site GC366 towards the present WAIS grounding line 866 \napparently was slower (Fig. 10a). 867 \nIce-stream retreat from the middle shelf towards Ronne Entrance shows a 868 \ndifferent pattern. Site GC357 in northern Ronne Entrance did not become ice 869 \nfree until 6.3 ka B.P. (Fig. 10b). Afterwards, the ice stream retreated more 870 \nrapidly to site GC360, which became ice free at ~4.0 ka B.P., and then to the 871 \nmodern ice front of the George VI Ice Shelf (Fig. 10b). The slow-down of ice-872 \nstream retreat from site GC368 to site GC357 and its apparent acceleration to 873 \nsite GC360 may have been controlled by the shelf bathymetry because a 874 \nbathymetric high is located seaward of site GC357 (indicated by the 600 m 875 \nwater depth contour in Fig. 1), while a deep basin is located just to the north of 876 \nsite GC360 (indicated by the 800 m water depth contour in Fig. 1). The 877 \npalaeo-ice stream in Belgica Trough was marine-based, and therefore an 878 \ninverse bed slope may have accelerated the retreat of its grounding line (e.g. 879 \nThomas & Bentley, 1978; Oppenheimer, 1998; Schoof, 2007; Vaughan & 880 \nArthern, 2007). 881 \n36 \nOur chronology for ice-stream retreat is consistent with the minimum age of 882 \n20.0 ka B.P. for the iceberg scouring of site GC371 (Table 1, Fig. 2). 883 \nComparison of our preferred deglaciation chronology with the chronology 884 \nbased on the corrected AIO 14C ages from the lower part of the distal sub-ice 885 \nshelf\/sub-sea ice facies reveals similar patterns (Fig. 10). However, the ages 886 \nin the latter chronology are several thousand years older and exhibit an 887 \ninconsistency for ice-stream retreat from site GC357 to site GC360 (Fig. 10). 888 \nTherefore, we consider those ages to be too old and unreliable for recording 889 \nice-sheet retreat. 890 \nOur preferred chronology for the ice-sheet retreat from the southern 891 \nBellingshausen Sea shelf indicates that initial deglaciation was very early 892 \nwhen compared to other regions of the West Antarctic shelf. For example, the 893 \nAPIS began to retreat from the north-western shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula 894 \nat ~15 ka B.P. and from its south-western shelf at ~12 ka B.P. (Heroy & 895 \nAnderson, 2005, 2007), while the WAIS began to retreat from the eastern 896 \nAmundsen Sea shelf between ~20 and 16 ka B.P. (Lowe & Anderson, 2002) 897 \nand from the Ross Sea shelf between ~21 and 14 ka B.P. (Licht et al., 1996, 898 \n1998, 1999; Bindschadler, 1998; Domack et al., 1999; Conway et al., 1999; 899 \nLicht & Andrews, 2002; Mosola & Anderson, 2006). However, the eastern 900 \nWeddell Sea shelf may have started to become free of grounded ice at the 901 \nsame time as the southern Bellingshausen Sea shelf, while the Cosmonaut 902 \nSea shelf may have deglaciated as early as ~30 ka B.P. (Anderson et al., 903 \n2002, and references therein). Early initial ice-sheet retreat at ~30 ka B.P. is 904 \nalso reported for the Bunger Hills, East Antarctica (Gore et al., 2001). 905 \nIt is important to note that Belgica Trough is larger than any other glacial 906 \n37 \ntrough along the Pacific margin of West Antarctica (cf. \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 907 \n2005a,b; Shipp et al., 1999; Wellner et al., 2001, 2006; Lowe & Anderson, 908 \n2002; Heroy & Anderson, 2005; Walker et al., 2007; Larter et al., 2009). The 909 \nice stream flowing through Belgica Trough also probably differed from other 910 \nWest Antarctic ice streams, because it drained an area >200,000 km2 in the 911 \nhinterland (see Fig. 9 in \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005b). Additionally, modern uplift 912 \nrates and crustal uplift in the direct hinterland of Belgica Trough seem to be 913 \nthe highest in the whole of Antarctica and suggest significant glacial isostatic 914 \nadjustment of this area (Ivins & James, 2005; Riva et al., 2009). All these 915 \nobservations are consistent with a rather unique glacial history of the southern 916 \nBellingshausen Sea shelf and its hinterland and with a continuous, prolonged 917 \nice-sheet retreat as it is indicated by our chronology (Fig. 10). In any case, the 918 \ntimelines of ice-stream retreat in the study area (Fig. 10) strongly suggest that, 919 \nsimilar to the Ross Sea shelf (Bindschadler, 1998; Conway et al., 1999), post-920 \nLGM deglaciation of both the WAIS and the APIS is still in progress. 921 \nOur ice-retreat chronology indicates that the deglaciation of the southern 922 \nBellingshausen Sea shelf may have contributed to global meltwater pulses at 923 \n17.1, 12.5 and 9.5 ka B.P. (Fairbanks, 1989; Clark et al., 2002, 2004), but was 924 \nprobably not responsible for any particular meltwater pulse (Fig. 10). The ice-925 \nstream retreat through Belgica Trough was apparently slower than the retreat 926 \nof other palaeo-ice streams from the West Antarctic shelf (Licht et al., 1996, 927 \n1998, 1999; Bindschadler, 1998; Domack et al., 1999; Conway et al., 1999; 928 \nLicht & Andrews, 2002; Lowe & Anderson, 2002; Mosola & Anderson, 2006; 929 \nHeroy & Anderson, 2005, 2007; McKay et al., 2008). The slower retreat in our 930 \nstudy area may result from the slightly seaward dipping middle-outer shelf 931 \n38 \nprofile in the southern Bellingshausen Sea (slope angle ~0.08\u00b0, see Fig. 1 in 932 \nHillenbrand et al., 2005), which is unusual for the West Antarctic shelf, but 933 \nmay have delayed grounding-line retreat (Thomas & Bentley, 1978; Schoof, 934 \n2007). 935 \nOur reconstructed velocities for the ice-stream retreat from Belgica Trough 936 \nrange from 7 to 55 m\/yr, which is very slow when compared to the grounding-937 \nline retreat velocity of ~550 m\/yr observed for Pine Island Glacier (Amundsen 938 \nSea) between 1992 and 1996 (Rignot, 2002). However, grounding-zone 939 \nwedges were observed in Belgica Trough by \u00d3 Cofaigh et al. (2005b), which 940 \nindicate that the ice-stream retreat was episodic (\u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2008; 941 \nDowdeswell et al., 2008b). Thus, it is conceivable that there may have been 942 \nconsiderable variations in retreat rates between grounding-line positions. 943 \nThese variations may not be captured by our deglaciation chronology because 944 \nit provides only mean velocities. 945 \nThe lithology of the sediment cores from the southern Bellingshausen Sea 946 \nshelf indicates that the ice stream retreating from Belgica Trough terminated 947 \nin an ice shelf (sections 4.1.1. and 4.1.2.; Hillenbrand et al., 2005). A recent 948 \ntheoretical, glaciological study concluded that ice shelves fringing marine-949 \nbased ice streams have a major buttressing effect (Goldberg et al., 2009). 950 \nTherefore, the ice shelf of the ice stream flowing through Belgica Trough may 951 \nalso have delayed post-LGM grounding-line retreat and contributed to the 952 \nobserved slow and prolonged retreat pattern (Fig. 10). 953 \n4.2.3. Open questions 954 \nOur preferred deglaciation chronology raises some crucial questions. First, the 955 \nages for ice-stream retreat from sites GC366, GC368, GC372 and GC374 are 956 \n39 \nsignificantly older than the ages further up-core (Fig. 2). Do even some of our 957 \npreferred deglaciation ages lie in the lower limb of the \"dog leg\" as the age-958 \ndepth profiles suggest for cores GC366, GC368 and GC374 (Fig. 7)? Not 959 \nnecessarily, we think, because during ice-sheet retreat a sub-ice shelf setting 960 \nmay be characterised by extremely low sedimentation rates or even no 961 \ndeposition (cf. Licht et al., 1998). When an ice shelf is large and\/or the rate of 962 \nretreat is slow, a core site may remain for quite a long time in a zone roughly 963 \nhalf way between the grounding line and the ice-shelf front, where 964 \ndepositional rates are extremely low due to the lack of particle supply (the 965 \n\"null zone\" as defined by Domack et al., 1999). The same should apply for a 966 \ncore site that experiences a long period of permanent sea-ice cover. 967 \nNevertheless, it remains a possibility that the AIO 14C dates obtained from the 968 \nmiddle lithological unit or the base of the upper unit in our cores may be 969 \nunreliable ages for ice retreat. Although unlikely, we cannot entirely rule out 970 \nthat these dates provide the ages of reworked fossil organic material supplied 971 \nfrom the grounding line of the retreating ice stream rather than the ages of 972 \nfresh organic matter produced by planktonic organisms that lived subsequent 973 \nto grounding-line retreat. In this scenario, ice-sheet advance and retreat 974 \nacross the shelf of the southern Bellingshausen Sea could only have occurred 975 \nduring a time window represented by a gap in the obtained AIO 14C dates. 976 \nThe only apparent gaps in our dates span the time intervals from 24.5 to 20.5 977 \nka B.P. and 12.0 to 8.0 ka B.P., respectively (Fig. 7). Ice-sheet retreat during 978 \nthe former interval would indeed be consistent with the deglaciation history of 979 \nother parts of the West Antarctic shelf (section 4.2.2.), while deglaciation 980 \nduring the latter interval seems to be too young. More sophisticated 981 \n40 \ntechniques of radiocarbon dating, such as compound-specific AMS 14C dating 982 \nof the organic matter (e.g. Ingalls et al., 2004; Hatt\u00e9 et al., 2008; Ohkouchi & 983 \nEglinton, 2008; Rosenheim et al., 2008), are required to test these 984 \nhypotheses. 985 \nSecond, according to our preferred stratigraphy ice retreated from site GC357 986 \nat 6.3 ka B.P. (Figs. 2, 10). This date is close to the age of 6.6 ka B.P., which 987 \nwe consider as deglaciation age for site GC359 near Beethoven Peninsula 988 \n(Fig. 2). However, core GC358, which is located in close proximity of site 989 \nGC359 (Fig. 1), recovered an expanded seasonal open-marine facies, whose 990 \nbasal age is 16.3 ka B.P. (Fig. 2). Is the older age from core GC358 more 991 \nreliable than the age from site GC357? Again, it could be argued that the old 992 \nage at site GC358 results from significant contamination, which may be 993 \nsupported by a slight kink in the age-depth profile (Fig. 7). However, even if 994 \nthe earlier deglaciation age is correct, we have to keep in mind that sites 995 \nGC358 and GC359 were affected by ice flow towards NNW, but not into 996 \nBelgica Trough (Fig. 1; \u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005b). Therefore, ice-sheet retreat 997 \nfrom sites GC358 and GC359 may have been decoupled from the ice-stream 998 \nretreat along Belgica Trough (which controlled the deglaciation age of site 999 \nGC357) and may have started significantly earlier. 1000 \nThird, our reconstructed early start of deglaciation of the outer and middle 1001 \nshelf is not corroborated by the 18O profiles from the corresponding core 1002 \nsites (Fig. 5a). Our 18O data do not show the average global 18O decrease 1003 \nof ~1.0\u00b10.2\u2030, which was caused by the melting of terrestrial ice-sheets and is 1004 \ntypical for foraminiferal 18O profiles spanning the last termination at 14 ka 1005 \nB.P. (e.g. Imbrie et al., 1984; Duplessy et al., 2002). Does the lack of the 18O 1006 \n41 \nshift indicate that the sediments are younger than 14 ka B.P.? Due to a lack of 1007 \ncalcareous benthic foraminifera, we had to analyze N. pachyderma sin. tests. 1008 \nThe data may be overprinted by local temperature and salinity changes in the 1009 \nsurface waters. Hendry et al. (2009) showed that on the shelf west of the 1010 \nAntarctic Peninsula, which is significantly affected by the seasonal freezing 1011 \nand melting of sea ice, the 18O values of recent planktonic foraminifera may 1012 \nvary up to 0.7\u2030 throughout the year. Using salinity data that were measured 1013 \nwithin the habitat of N. pachyderma sin. (i.e. within the upper 300 m of the 1014 \nwater column) in our study area (Jenkins & Jacobs, 2008), we calculated 1015 \nhypothetical 18O values for seawater on the southern Bellingshausen Sea 1016 \nshelf. We found that even today the 18O values may vary from -0.8\u2030 to 1017 \n+0.3\u2030 (using the equation of Kohfeld et al, 2000) and from -0.9\u2030 to +0.1\u2030 1018 \n(using the equation of Duplessy et al., 1991), respectively. This local variability 1019 \nof seawater 18O could indeed wipe out any global termination signal in the N. 1020 \npachyderma sin. tests. However, the low amplitudes of the 18O fluctuations in 1021 \nthe cores from the southern Bellingshausen Sea (Fig. 5a) seem to contradict 1022 \nthis explanation. 1023 \nFourth, a grounded ice stream, which extended north of the modern George 1024 \nVI Ice Shelf through Marguerite Trough to the shelf break of the Antarctic 1025 \nPeninsula, retreated from the outer to the inner shelf between ~12.1 and 8.4 1026 \nka B.P. (\u00d3 Cofaigh et al., 2005a; Heroy & Anderson, 2007). Thereafter, the 1027 \nnorthern part of the George VI Ice Shelf collapsed (or at least its northern front 1028 \nretreated significantly south of its modern position) at ~8.1 ka B.P. (Bentley et 1029 \nal., 2005). The northern part of the ice shelf re-established (or its northern 1030 \nfront re-advanced) after 7.3 ka B.P.. Our post-LGM ice-retreat reconstruction 1031 \n42 \nfor the southern part of the George VI Ice Shelf indicates that grounded ice or 1032 \nan ice shelf cleared the inner shelf in Ronne Entrance not before ~4.0 ka B.P. 1033 \n(Fig. 10b). Are these different deglaciation histories for the northern and 1034 \nsouthern parts of the George VI Ice Shelf feasible? Probably, they are only 1035 \ncompatible, if the deglaciation of the southern Bellingshausen Sea shelf was 1036 \ndecoupled from the post-LGM ice-sheet retreat in other areas of the APIS and 1037 \nthe WAIS (cf. section 4.2.2.). 1038 \n5. CONCLUSIONS 1039 \n In sediment cores from the continental shelf and uppermost slope of the 1040 \nsouthern Bellingshausen Sea down-core changes in clay mineral 1041 \nassemblages allow the identification of the most reliable AIO 14C ages for 1042 \nice-sheet retreat from the core sites. 1043 \n The last advance of a grounded ice stream through Belgica Trough must 1044 \nhave occurred after 36.0 ka B.P., and possibly after 32.7 ka B.P.. The outer 1045 \ntrough deglaciated at ~25.5 ka B.P., the middle part of the trough at ~19.8 1046 \nka B.P., the inner shelf in Eltanin Bay at ~12.3 ka B.P., and the inner shelf 1047 \nin Ronne Entrance at ~6.3 ka B.P.. 1048 \n The retreat of the WAIS and the APIS from the shelf of the southern 1049 \nBellingshausen Sea started earlier than in other parts of the West Antarctic 1050 \nshelf, suggesting a unique ice-sheet history. In the study area, post-LGM 1051 \ndeglaciation of both the WAIS and the APIS may still be in progress. 1052 \n The style of ice-stream retreat from Belgica Trough was episodic, slow and 1053 \nprolonged. The deglaciation of the southern Bellingshausen Sea shelf may 1054 \nhave contributed to global meltwater pulses at 17.1, 12.5 and 9.5 ka B.P., 1055 \nbut did not cause a particular meltwater pulse. 1056 \n43 \n Some problems regarding the chronology of ice-sheet retreat from the 1057 \nsouthern Bellingshausen Sea shelf are still unresolved and should be 1058 \naddressed by compound-specific AIO 14C dating in the future. 1059 \n6.

The continuous profiles are based on corrected AMS 14C dates, which 1560 \nare unlikely to be contaminated by reworked fossil organic carbon, and 1561 \ntherefore provide the most reliable chronology of ice-sheet retreat from the 1562 \nshelf. The dashed profiles are based on corrected 14C ages from the base 1563 \nof the transitional sedimentary unit. These dates are likely to be 1564 \nsignificantly contaminated with recycled fossil organic matter and therefore 1565 \nprovide unreliable ages for deglaciation.
