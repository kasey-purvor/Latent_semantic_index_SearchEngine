Our measurement strategy differentiates first between specific worries and diffuse anxieties in emotional responses to crime, and second between productive and counterproductive effects on subjective well-being and precautionary activities. Drawing on data from a representative survey of seven London neighbourhoods, these distinctions are combined into an ordinal scale that moves from the \u2018unworried\u2019, to low-level motivating emotions, to frequent and dysfunctional worry about crime. We demonstrate that different categories of \u2018fear\u2019 have different correlates and explain different levels of variation in public confidence in policing.

Pushing and pulling in various directions over the past few decades, this \nbackground has provided a springboard for enquiries into inter alia \u2018fear of crime\u2019 (Ferraro, 1995), \n\u2018anxiety about crime\u2019 (Hough, 1995) and \u2018public sensibilities towards crime\u2019 (Girling et al., 2000). \nOver the years, studies have generated knowledge about perceptions of risk and feelings of \nvulnerability (Lupton, 1999), the construction of public concerns about anti-social behaviour (Burney, \n2005), relational concerns regarding neighbourhood breakdown, social change and moral consensus \n(Jackson, 2004; Farrall et al., 2009), and the tolerance (Patillo, 1998) and resilience that people \ndevelop to mitigate risks they are exposed to by crime (Innes and Jones, 2006; Vale and Campanella, \n2005),  \nNow an organising force of public and political life (Lee, 2007), public insecurities about \ncrime are evident in numerous public and political tensions about crime and justice (Garland, 1996; \n2001). Fear of crime has been linked to real and palpable effects on individual and community \nbehaviour (Pain 1997; Stanko, 1990) and well-being (Stafford et al., 2007; Jackson and Stafford, \n2009). Yet, despite the centrality of emotions to this (and other) criminological debates, there have \nbeen few detailed analyses of the cognitive and behavioural processes involved in the construction of \nemotional responses to crime. While the study of emotions has become au courant across the \nhumanities and social sciences (in psychology, Frijda, 1986; in sociology, Turner and Stets, 2005; in \nsocial psychology, Parrott, 2001; and in social philosophy, Goldie, 2000), few criminological studies \nhave undertaken systematic exploration of the mobilization or expression of emotions about crime (de \nHann and Loader, 2002; Gray et al,, 2008a). Notably, a series of critiques of standard survey tools has \nbrought to light the methodological difficulties involved in measuring worry about crime, with \nscholars identifying some of the empirical and theoretical misspecifications commonly involved in \n\u2018fear of crime\u2019 research (Garofalo and Laub, 1978; Ferraro and LaGrange, 1987; Hale, 1996; Farrall \net al., 2009). New avenues of research must therefore be investigated if we are to develop more valid \nand reliable research tools, to dig more deeply into the reality of this social phenomenon, and to \nexamine its variety, its effects, its causes and its very empirical nature.  \nWe seek in this paper to open up fresh lines of enquiry in the fear of crime. Building on recent \nadvances in the meaning and measurement of this contested concept \u2013 and addressing both the nature \nand the impact of emotional responses to crime \u2013 we develop a more comprehensive understanding of \nhow crime-emotions affect the ways in which individuals navigate their social worlds and respond to \nexternal stimuli. We introduce a new ordinal measure that locates various emotional and behavioural \nresponses to crime on a scale. After first testing the socio-demographic and perceptual correlates of \nour new measurement strategy, and second exploring the relationship between fear of crime and \npublic confidence in policing, we close with a discussion of the promise of longitudinal research into \nthe dynamic nature of fear of crime over the life-course.   \n \nAdvancing the definition of fear of crime \nDefining feelings \nThe measurement procedure presented in this paper combines two recent advances in the field.  The \nfirst line of enquiry distinguishes between everyday worries about crime and more diffuse anxieties \nabout crime (Farrall et al., 2009). According to this account, \u2018worry\u2019 refers to concrete mental events \nof concern (Farrall and Gadd, 2004) while \u2018anxiety\u2019 refers to a more diffuse mental state (Hough, \n2004). The second line of enquiry distinguishes between functional\/productive and \n                                                 \n1 Historically, scholars have referred to the body of work on emotional responses to crime as \u2018fear of crime\u2019 \nresearch. For example, in his review of the literature Hale (1996) uses this very term. It has operated as a \nclumsy, but nevertheless common catch-all phrase for a variety of emotional responses to the threat of \nvictimisation \u2013 which may include studies of \u2018fear\u2019 but also other negative and even neutral emotions.  \n \n4 \n \ndysfunctional\/counter-productive effects of everyday worries and anxieties. We turn, first, to the \ndistinction between worry and anxiety. \nVictimisation surveys routinely ask respondents to summarise their levels of \u2018worry\u2019 (UK) or \n\u2018fear\u2019 (US) about specific crimes or their perceived likelihood of victimisation (in line with an \ninfluential article by Ferraro and LaGrange, 1987). Since 1982, for example, the British Crime Survey \n(BCS) has routinely asked respondents a standard question; \u201chow worried are you about being \n[burgled\/ robbed\/ having your car stolen]?\u201d2 Yet these intensity measures may often collate not just \neveryday worries or fears, but also some emotionally-tinged \u2018attitude\u2019 towards risk (Tourangeau et al., \n2000; Jackson, 2006; Farrall et al., 2009) or future-oriented anxiety (Sacco, 2005). Respondents may \nbe thinking less about past emotional experience, and more about whether they are generally troubled \nby the thought of the risk of being victimized. \nConversely, frequency measures may better explore how often people have experienced \nmemorable events of worry about being burgled, robbed and so forth over the past twelve months \n(Farrall and Gadd, 2004; Gray et al., 2008b) or the past month (see Jackson, 2005). The question \nwording allows participants to report a \u2018raw count\u2019 of the number of worrying events over the given \nperiod, employing a narrow time frame that gives respondents a limited reference period for more \naccurate recalls of situated and concrete moments of concern. Importantly, when the 2003\/2004 BCS \nfielded both standard and new frequency measures3, the resulting analyses showed that the two \nindicators gave quite different estimates of the distribution of fear of crime across England and Wales \n(Gray et al., 2008b). For many individuals the two measures did not map neatly onto one another (see \nFarrall et al., 2009 for a full discussion of these results); some people who reported that they were \nworried about crime (to the standard question), also stated that they could not recall a recent event of \nworry (on the time-limited frequency measure).  \nBy combining the standard (intensity) and frequency measures, it was possible to differentiate \nbetween those who we classified as i) the \u2018unworried\u2019 \u2013 they reported that they were \u2018unworried\u2019 on \nboth measures, ii) the \u2018worried\u2019 \u2013 who state they worry on the standard question and could recall \nrecent episodes of worry via the frequency measure, and iii) the \u2018anxious\u2019 \u2013  participants who said that \nthey were worried on the standard question but could not recall a recent event of worry when asked \nthe frequency question (this \u2018anxious\u2019 response to crime has been described by Hough (2004) as a \n\u2018rumbling state of unease\u2019). The most common grouping referred to those who reported they were \nunworried on both measures.4 The most interesting category was the \u2018anxious\u2019, i.e. those respondents \nwho said they were worried about a particular crime but were unable to recall a recent episode of \nworry. These individuals described an emotional experience that was more diffuse and more \nintangible than any memorable or conspicuous event.  \n \nDefining functions \nThe second development revolves around the notion of \u2018functional fear\u2019 (Jackson and Gray, 2010; cf. \nFattah, 1993; Warr, 2000). By eroding well-being through a range of negative cognitive effects (such \nas pessimism and problem exaggeration) and detrimental affective states (such as emotional \ndiscomfort and depression), worry can be dysfunctional and counterproductive. But the psychological \nliterature has also highlighted some \u2018functional\u2019 and motivational properties of low-level worry \n(Tallis et al., 1994; Gladstone and Parker, 2003; Holaway et al., 2006; cf. Nolen-Hoesksema et al., \n2008). According to this account, worry can be helpful and adaptive: a problem-solving activity that \nhelps people anticipate and prepare for threat (Borkovec et al., 2004) by prompting adaptive vigilance \nand routine precaution.  \nProviding support for this conceptual and empirical distinction in fear of crime, a recent study \nfound that around one-quarter of individuals who said that they were worried about crime, also \nreported that i) they took precautions, that ii) these precautions made them feel safer, and that iii) \nneither their precautions nor their worries about crime reduced their quality of life (Jackson and Gray, \n2010). In such circumstances \u2018fear\u2019 might be better viewed as a natural and functional defence against \ncrime involving straightforward adaptations and behaviours: a socially beneficial activity that allows \n                                                 \n2 Response alternatives are \u2018very worried\u2019, \u2018quite worried\u2019, \u2018a bit worried\u2019 and \u2018not at all worried.\u2019 \n3 Both questions were field to a sub-sample, \u2018follow-up D\u2019 of the British Crime Survey (2003\/2004).  \n4 The size of the categories were as follows: 62% unworried, 23% anxious, 15% worried (Farrall et al., 2009)   \n5 \n \nindividuals to exert control over perceived risks, encouraging them to behave in a responsible \nfashion.5  \nSpecifically, Jackson and Gray (2010) measured (a) self-reported worry about crime, (b) the \nprecautions that respondents did or did not take against crime, and (c) individuals\u2019 own tacit sense of \nthe resulting impact on their quality of life. The method identified two distinct reactionary behaviour \npatterns: one which could be characterised as \u2018functional,\u2019 the other as \u2018dysfunctional.\u2019 \n\u2018Dysfunctional\u2019 worry occurred when participants took precautions to protect themselves from crime, \nbut reported that these actions reduced their quality of life. By contrast, \u2018functional worry\u2019 resulted in \nthem taking precautions, feeling safer, but without their quality of life being reduced by the \nprecautions they took or the levels of worry they experienced in relation to this.6  \n \nMethod \nThe current study integrates these two methodological developments into a new and improved \nmeasurement tool. By examining whether the functional and dysfunctional properties of fear sit \nalongside evidence that worry about crime may manifest as memorable episodes or more diffuse \nanxiety, we develop a new ordinal index that, the available evidence may suggest, operates along a \ncontinuum. The continuum moves from \u2018unworried\u2019 to positive then to negative emotional responses, \ndepending on the success or otherwise of participant\u2019s management of risk and emotion. \u2018Functional \nanxiety\u2019 sits at the positive end: subjects manage their emotions (so they rarely, if ever, find \nthemselves in threatening situations) and use their low-level anxiety to motivate precautions. \n\u2018Dysfunctional worry\u2019 sits at the negative end: individuals experience concrete moments of worry and \nfeel that their well-being is reduced by their worries or precautions.  \n \nThe survey \nThe 2007 Safer Neighbourhoods Survey obtained data around 400 residents in each of seven electoral \nwards that were chosen to represent a diverse cross-section of London. Electoral wards are \nadministrative geographic units used to elect local government councillors. The sampling had three \nstages. First, there was random probability sampling of household addresses. Second, there was \nrandom selection of a dwelling unit in cases where a single address included more than one unit. \nThird, there was random selection of an adult to be targeted for interview in cases where a household \ncontained more than one adult. The response rate was 43%. The final sample size was 2,844.  \n \nMeasures \nThis study focuses on worry about robbery, treated here as one of a number of possible indicators of \nworry about falling victim of personal crime in public space. Because measures of worry about \npersonal crime typically load on one factor when factor analysis techniques are used (Ferraro, 1995; \nJackson, 2005; Farrall et al., 2009), we treat our single indicator as an imperfect proxy for the joint \ndistribution of worry about personal crime in public space, i.e. the tendency for individuals to feel \nworried about falling victim of a common type of personal crime in public space. \n\u2018Worry\u20197 and \u2018anxiety\u20198 about crime were measured using both standard and frequency-based \nquestions. Focusing on robbery, the standard measure was phrased: \u2018How worried are you about being \n                                                 \n5 It is important to emphasise that by defining a \u2018functional\u2019 manifestation of worry we are only referring to the \nsorts of worries that individuals themselves confirm do not impact on their quality of life and provide protective \nand satisfying benefits. These experiences can be contrasted with the sort of worrying responses that become \ndamaging and involve negative cognitive (e.g. pessimism, problem exaggeration) and affective (e.g. emotional \ndiscomfort, depression) consequences as well as behavioural concomitants.  \n6 It should be noted that there may be \u2018hidden costs\u2019 to the precautionary behaviour employed by respondents. \nSome may report that their quality of life and wellbeing was not reduced by their worries or pre-emptive \nactivities, without acknowledging the full practical, financial and emotional costs.  \n7 Worry is defined here as tangible and recent episodes of emotional arousal which participants can recall via \nboth the frequency and \u2018standard\u2019 measure (Farrall et al., 2009).  \n8 Anxiety is defined here as diffuse concern without the memorable \u2018spikes\u2019 of worry (as above). This group \nreport that they are worried about crime to the standard measure but also state they cannot recall a recent \nepisode of worry.  \n6 \n \nmugged\/robbed?\u2019 [response alternatives were: very, fairly, a bit, or not at all]. As in Gray et al. \n(2008b) and Farrall et al. (2009) the frequency measures were phrased: \n \nQ1: \u2018In the past year, have you ever felt worried about being mugged\/robbed?\u2019 \nQ2: [if YES at Q1] \u2018How frequently have you felt like this in the last year\u2019 [response: n times \nrecorded] \nQ3: [if YES at Q1] \u2018On the last occasion how fearful did you feel?\u2019 [responses: not very \nworried, a little bit worried, quite worried, very worried or cannot remember].  \n \nTo measure the functional or dysfunctional aspects of worry about crime, we follow Jackson and \nGray\u2019s (2010) approach. This has three sequential steps:  \n \n1. Measure worry about crime using \u2018standard\u2019 measures (as above);  \n2. If those who say they are worried about crime also say their quality of life is reduced either by \ntheir worries or their precautions against crime (if taken), then assign these individuals to the \n\u2018dysfunctional fear\u2019 group; and, \n3. If those who say they are worried also say that the precautions they take make them feel safer, \nand that their quality of life is not reduced by either their worries or their precautions, then \nassign these individuals to the \u2018functional fear\u2019 group (and assume that worry acts as a \nproblem-solving activity, motivating attention and activity). \n \nRespondents were asked how often (if at all) they avoided (because of crime) public transport, certain \nstreets or areas during the day, and certain streets or areas at night. A dichotomous variable was \nconstructed to denote whether an individual took precautions or not. They were also asked: \u2018As a \nresult of the precautions you take against crime, to what extent do you feel safer?\u2019 (the response \nalternatives were: \u2018not at all\u2019, \u2018a little\u2019, \u2018moderately\u2019, \u2018quite a bit\u2019 and \u2018very much\u2019). This variable was \nalso dichotomised: zero equalled \u2018not at all\u2019; one equalled either \u2018a little\u2019, \u2018moderately\u2019, \u2018quite a bit\u2019 \nor \u2018very much.\u2019 Respondents then reported how much (if at all) their quality of their life was affected \nby i) worry about crime and ii) the precautions they took to guard against crime [the response \nalternatives were \u2018not at all\u2019, \u2018a little\u2019, \u2018moderately\u2019, \u2018quite a bit\u2019 and \u2018very much\u2019]. Again, both \nvariables were dichotomised: zero equalled \u2018not at all\u2019 or \u2018a little\u2019; one equalled either \u2018moderately\u2019, \n\u2018quite a bit\u2019 or \u2018very much\u2019.  \n \nResults \nWe begin with overall levels of worry about crime within our sample. In response to the standard \nquestion, 31% of respondents said they were worried about being robbed (24% \u2018fairly\u2019 and 7% \n\u2018very\u2019). When asked the frequency questions a more modest 21% said they had worried about robbery \nduring the previous 12 months; 3% said they had worried 1-3 times, 5% said they had worried 4-12 \ntimes, 3% said they had worried 13-51 times, and 10% said they had worried 52 times or more.9  \nThe differences in the overall proportions (31% compared to 21%) suggest that individuals \ncan give different answers to the standard and frequency questions. Combining the standard and \nfrequency measures to create three groups (see Farrall et al., 2009 for a detailed rationale), we found \nthe following: \n \n\u2022 65% of the sample were \u2018unworried\u2019: they reported that they were \u2018not at all\u2019 or \u2018not very\u2019 \nworried about robbery, and reported no episodes of worry in the past year; \n                                                 \n9 As stated above, participants were asked to produce a \u2018raw count\u2019 of the number of worrying episodes over the \npast 12 months, but figures were categorised post-survey for brevity. It is clear from the raw data that \nparticipant\u2019s answers did involve an element of guessing. Farrall et al (2009) found that raw scores from this \ndata tended to collect at distinctive points, such as 6, 10, 12, 20, 50, 52, 100, 300, 365. Following Tourangeau et \nal. (2000) it is likely these reported frequencies reflect two types of estimation, rounding-up (10, 20, 50 etc) and \ncalculated averages (\u201cevery other month\u201d, \u201conce a month\u201d, \u201ceveryday\u201d etc.). See Farrall et al., 2009 for further \ndiscussion on the distribution of raw scores.  \n7 \n \n\u2022 21% were \u2018worried\u2019: they said they were \u2018fairly\u2019 or \u2018very\u2019 worried and they had experienced \nat least one episode of worry over the previous year; and, \n\u2022 14% were \u2018anxious\u2019: they said they were \u2018fairly\u2019 or \u2018very\u2019 worried, but they also reported that \nthey had not experienced one episode of worry over the past year. \n \nInvestigating next the functional fear classification (Jackson and Gray, 2010), we found that \naround one-quarter of individuals who admitted some level of worry about crime, additionally \nexhibited a kind of emotional experience which, according to their self-report, resembled a motivating \nand problem-solving activity. They took precautions; they felt safer as a result; and their quality of life \nwas unaffected by worries and precautions. This method generated three groups: \n \n\u2022 65% of the sample were unworried; \n\u2022 27% of the sample was in the dysfunctional worry group. Respondents reported being i) \nworried about crime but also ii) that their quality of life was reduced by either their worries or \ntheir precautions (or both); and, \n\u2022 8% of the sample were \u2018functionally worried\u2019. They reported being i) worried about crime; ii) \nthat they took precautions that made them feel safer; and iii) judged their quality of life \nunaffected by either their worries or their precautions. \n \nTable 1 then combines these two methods of differentiating public insecurities about crime \ninto one ordinal scale. Firstly, around two-thirds were \u2018unworried\u2019. Just under one-tenth reported \nfunctional \u2018fear\u2019 (whether anxiety or worry), while around one-quarter reported dysfunctional \u2018fear\u2019 \n(whether anxiety or worry). In short, the largest group was the unworried and the proportions of the \nremaining fear groups increased exponentially as the effect of worry and precautionary behaviours \nbecame stronger. Importantly, the order of the categories had a significant meaning; as the negative \nimpact of emotional responses to the risk of victimisation increases, so too did the proportion of cases \nreporting such effects. In other words, the most common \u2018fear group\u2019 also suffered the most damaging \nemotional effects. Specifically, the \u2018anxious \u2013 functional\u2019 group managed their emotions (they rarely \nexperienced episodes of worry) and their sense of safety (they felt safer because of the precautions \nthey took and their quality of life was not harmed by their precautions or emotions), this group had the \nlowest frequency (3%). The \u2018worried \u2013 functional\u2019 group (next most common at 5%) managed their \nsense of safety, but their \u2018fear of crime\u2019 manifested in concrete mental events of worry. Perhaps such \nindividuals can recall moments of worry \u2013 where they encountered, for example, certain threatening \nindividuals in public space, but they generally take precautions by crossing the street or taking \ndifferent routes, which make them feel safer.  \n \n    INSERT TABLE 1 HERE.  \n \nThe \u2018anxious \u2013 dysfunctional\u2019 group (11%) may rarely (if ever) worry, but still believe their \nquality of life is reduced by their precautions and\/or their concerns. This may reflect the negative \nimpact of long-term and persistent anxiety. Finally, the \u2018worried \u2013 dysfunctional\u2019 showed both \nnegative aspects. They experienced worry and their well-being was reduced by their actions and \nemotions. This is the most common fear group at 16%.  \nWe hypothesised that the \u2018anxious\u2019 group would be more likely to exhibit functional fear than \nthe \u2018worried\u2019 group. We predicted that those who rarely, if ever, worried about crime, may be in a \nposition to successfully manage their sense of risk, perhaps through various precautionary activities. \nLikewise we expected those who recalled recent episodes of worry might feel their quality of life was \nharder to maintain or have low confidence in the precautions they took. Yet counter to our expectation \nwe found that equal proportions of the \u2018anxious\u2019 and \u2018worried\u2019 exhibited \u2018functional fear.\u2019 Amongst \nthe anxious, 24% took precautions that made them feel safer and reported that their quality of life was \nnot damaged by precautions or worries. Amongst the worried, the figure was 25%. \n \nWhat were the empirical implications of this new categorisation of \u2018fear\u2019? \n8 \n \nOnce the new categories were established, we then examined whether the correlates and consequences \nof fear changed as a result of our new definition. We begin with the correlates. \n \nCorrelates of \u2018fear\u2019 \nWe first used hierarchical multinomial logistic regression to predict membership of each of our new \ncategories. Since respondents were clustered within neighbourhoods (an average of around 400 in \neach of the seven wards), we used a fixed effects model.10 The explanatory variables comprised a set \nof socio-economic characteristics, victimisation, perceptions of neighbourhood breakdown, and \nbroader concerns about social change and moral decline. The Appendix provides further details of the \nrelational concern measures.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 2 shows the comparison between membership of the \u2018unworried\u2019 group and \nmembership of each of the four \u2018fear\u2019 groups. Findings highlight the extent to which values of the \nexplanatory variables predict higher or lower odds of individuals falling in each group. We can thus \nassess whether certain social, psychological and demographic factors are associated in different ways \nwith membership of the four different \u2018fear\u2019 groups. Model I includes as explanatory variables \nvictimisation, self-reported health, age and gender (curvilinear and interaction effects involving age \nand gender were not statistically significant). Model II adds (i) perceptions of neighbourhood disorder \nand (ii) perceptions of collective efficacy. Model III adds (iii) concerns about the decline of moral \nvalues and (iv) concerns about long-term social change. \nBeginning with Model I, gender was a statistically significant predictor of membership of all \nfour of the \u2018fear\u2019 groups: females were more likely than males to be \u2018functionally anxious\u2019, \n\u2018dysfunctionally anxious\u2019, \u2018functionally worried\u2019 or \u2018dysfunctionally worried.\u2019 To interpret the \ncoefficients, consider the odds ratio of 2.08 (p<.001) for the \u2018female\u2019 explanatory variable (in Model \nI, in the comparison of \u2018unworried\u2019 and \u2018dysfunctional worried\u2019). The odds of being \u2018dysfunctionally \nworried\u2019 compared to being unworried were around two times higher for females than they were for \nmales (the 95% confidence interval of 1.64 to 2.63 meant that our best guess of the odds ratio in the \npopulation of the seven London wards is somewhere between 1.6 and 2.6). Victimisation (over the \npast twelve months) was associated with being \u2018dysfunctionally anxious\u2019, \u2018functionally worried\u2019 or \n\u2018dysfunctionally worried.\u2019 Strikingly, the odds ratio for \u2018dysfunctionally worried\u2019 was considerably \nlarger than for the other statistically significant contrasts. Similarly, self-reported health was only a \nstatistically significant predictor for \u2018dysfunctionally worried\u2019. This suggests that \u2013 compared to the \nother \u2018fear\u2019 groups \u2013 dysfunctional worry is associated strongly with victimisation experience and \npoor health (cf. Jackson and Stafford, 2009). \nTurning to Model II, perception of neighbourhood disorder was found to be a significant \npredictor of membership of each of the four groups. The odds ratio of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.28) for \ndysfunctional worry meant that a unit increase in public concerns about disorder was associated with a \npredicted increase in the odds of being dysfunctionally worried (compared to being unworried) of \n23%. Perception of collective efficacy was also a statistically significant predictor for all the groups. \nReplicating the work of previous studies, these results highlight the importance of non-criminal social \nconditions in helping individuals manage their worries about crime (Ferraro, 1995; Taylor, 1996; \nJackson, 2004). Moreover, that perception of collective efficacy was most strongly related to \ndysfunctional worry may suggest that dysfunctional responses (which harm well-being) tend to \n                                                 \n10 We also used ordinal regression, which allows one to specify a categorical variable as the response. Unlike \nmultinomial logistic regression, ordinal regression takes into account the ordered nature of the measure. We \nreasoned that the current categorisation might be seen to have a natural, monotonic order with equal thresholds \nfrom one category to the next. We tested the three models (see Table 2) and conducted the Brant test of parallel \nodds assumption for each model. Only perceived disorder violated the parallel odds assumption, something \nborne out by inspection of the multinomial logistic regression results (Table 2), which showed that disorder was \na predictor of each of the contrasts but the effect size was roughly similar across these contrasts. However, \nbecause perceived disorder is a key variable in the current investigation, we chose multinomial logistic \nregression for the main analysis. \n9 \n \nemerge not just from signs of disorder, but more generally from the perceived erosion of a more \ntrusting and generally cooperative social climate.  \nModel III adds broader relational concerns. Concerns about long-term social change did not \nemerge as a significant predictor of membership of the fear grouping categories. However, both \nworry-groups were significantly more likely to be apprehensive about moral decline. As prior studies \nhave stressed, public unease about the health of a local neighbourhood, community fragmentation and \nmoral authority lie at the heart of worry about crime (Dowds and Ahrendt, 1995; Girling et al., 2000; \nElster, 2004). Notably, in addition to the perceptual variables, the dysfunctional worry group in this \nmodel remained statistically more likely to be recent victims of crime. This analysis suggests that \nemotional reactions to crime can be at their most damaging when citizens are positioned both at the \n\u2018coal-face\u2019 of crime and disorder, while  suffering the perceived loss of community bonds, collective \nefficacy and a decline in moral authority.  \n \nOne potential consequence of \u2018fear\u2019 \nFinally, by way of testing the potential utility of the new categorisation, we examine if the approach \ncasts new light on one potential consequence of the fear of crime: trust and confidence in the police \n(c.f. Innes et al., 2004). The available empirical evidence suggests little  support for an instrumental \nmodel of public confidence of policing, which states that people think about their local police in terms \nof crime and risk (when they worry for their safety they lose confidence in police activities and \nefficacy). Instead, the data are more consistent with a \u2018symbolic\u2019 or \u2018expressive\u2019  model, which holds \nthat crime and disorder challenge the moral structure of society, and that people look to agents of \nsocial control to channel group outrage and facilitate order (Tyler and Boeckmann, 1997; Jackson and \nSunshine, 2007; Jackson and Bradford, 2009). Previous studies have measured worry about crime \nusing standard measures (\u2018How worried are you \u2026?\u2019) rather than frequency measures (\u2018In the past \nyear, how often have you \u2026 ?\u2019). Moreover, they have not unpacked the concept into functional and \ndysfunctional elements. This leaves it open to question whether the new categorisation would detect \nhitherto undiscovered variation in the effects of insecurities about crime on confidence in policing.  \nTable 3 shows the parameter estimates from a linear regression model, where the response \nvariable is an index of public confidence in police effectiveness.11 Model I includes victim status, \nhealth, gender and age, but also four dummy variables that provide contrasts between \u2018unworried\u2019 and \neach of the four \u2018fear\u2019 groups (functional anxiety, dysfunctional anxiety, functional worry, and \ndysfunctional worry). The results indicate that those in the functional anxiety group had similar levels \nof confidence in police effectiveness compared to those in the unworried group, holding constant the \nother predictors in the model. However, confidence was lower for the other three \u2018fear\u2019 groups, with \nthe effect strongest for \u2018dysfunctional worry.\u2019  \n \n    INSERT TABLE 3 HERE.  \n \n Model II adds in public concerns about neighbourhood disorder and social cohesion\/informal \nsocial control. Both were statistically significant predictors of public confidence. As with previous \nstudies, controlling for public concerns about neighbourhood disorder and social control reduced the \neffect of worry about crime on confidence in policing. Finally, Model III adds in broader public \nvalues and attitudes regarding a loss of moral authority and sense of community in society. Only \nconcern about long-term social change was a statistically significant predictor, and controlling for \nthese variables further dampened down the estimated effect of the fear of crime dummy variables. The \n\u2018dysfunctionally worried\u2019 had the least confidence in police effectiveness compared to the unworried \nor the other three \u2018fear\u2019 groups. \n                                                 \n11 Confidence in police effectiveness was measured by asking respondents: \u2018Here is a list of services that the \npolice provide. For each one, I would like you to tell me firstly how well you think the Metropolitan Police \nactually carry out each of them. Please use a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 = Not at all well and 7 = Very well.\u2019 The \nfunctions\/activities\/services were: prevents terrorism; responds to emergencies promptly; provide a visible \npatrolling presence; tackle gun crime; \u2018support victims and witnesses\u2019; \u2018police major events in London\u2019; \u2018tackle \ndrug dealing and drug use\u2019; \u2018tackle dangerous driving\u2019; and \u2018enforcing road legislation to improve traffic flows.\u2019 \n10 \n \n Previous work on public confidence in policing has \u2018lumped together\u2019 diverse aspects of fear \nof crime. Disentangling these aspects, we found that one aspect of \u2018fear\u2019 (functional anxiety) was not \na statistically significant predictor of confidence. By contrast, dysfunctional worry was the strongest \npredictor. It may therefore be that only the more frequent and counterproductive patterns of emotions \nabout crime erode public confidence in police effectiveness.  \n \nDiscussion \nIn summary, almost two thirds of the sample could be described as \u2018unworried\u2019 about crime, 21% \ncould be described as \u2018worried,\u2019 and 14% could be described as \u2018anxious.\u2019 Similar proportions of the \nworried and anxious group stated that their actions to guard against crime made them feel safer, \nwithout compromising their quality of life (thereby displaying what we call a \u2018functional\u2019 emotion). \nThis paper provides further evidence that worry does not necessarily diminish well-being, but can \ninvolve psychologically low-cost, potentially beneficial behaviours that leads to the aversion of \nthreats and hazards (Jackson and Gray, 2010).  \n Exploring the correlates of our new categorisation, we also found that \u2013 unlike the unworried \n\u2013 the remaining \u2018fear\u2019 groups were significantly affected by perceptions of disorder and levels of \ncollective efficacy in the neighbourhood. Disorder (or, as is often referred to in the media, anti-social \nbehaviour) and community bonds thus appear to be intimately condensed within the expression of \nboth worry and anxiety about crime (Farrall et al., 2009).  In this sense, crime related fears can be \nattached to micro, meso and macro dynamics; to the ways in which people actively navigate and \nexperience social spaces; to people\u2019s relationships with neighbours and local groups and their \nperceptions of the \u2018health\u2019 of their communities\u2019 social and moral structures.  Previous studies have \ninvestigated the links between disorder and fear of crime, finding that disorder signals to observers a \nloss of community controls and a breakdown in the norms and values that underpin cooperation \n(Skogan and Maxfield 1981; Wilson and Kelling, 1982; LaGrange et al., 1992; Robinson, et al., \n2003). Notably, we found that concerns about moral decline in society were only related to functional \nand dysfunctional worry (not anxiety).  \n The new categorisation was able to disentangle key differences within the fear groups. \nIndividuals who worried about crime, without benefitting from the functional advantages of these \nemotions (the dysfunctionally worried), were at greater risk than the other three categories of being \neffected by entrenched social and health problems. They were also more likely to be recent victims of \ncrime, to suffer ill-health or disability, to have negative perceptions of community bonds and concerns \nabout moral decline, as well as perceiving high levels of disorder in their neighbourhood. This result \nunderlines the theoretical and empirical value in further interrogating samples beyond a dichotomy of \nworried\/ not worried. Clearly some individuals in this study were in a stronger position to manage \ntheir emotional responses to crime, while others, provoked by a host of related personal and social \nproblems, were particularly vulnerable to the negative impact of crime-fears.12     \nWe also used the new index as a predictor of one possible outcome of fear of crime: public \nconfidence in policing. Again, those in the dysfunctional worry group \u2013 who experienced regular \nepisodes of worry and whose precautionary behaviour had a negative impact on their quality of life \u2013 \nhad the least confidence in their local police force. This is important. Previous studies have found that \nthe association between fear of crime and confidence in the police tends to disappear when one \ncontrols for more fundamental relational concerns. Our study indicates that future work on this issue \nneeds to unpack the functional and emotional aspects of fear of crime more carefully.  \n \nFurther considerations on method \n                                                 \n12 Consistent with previous research, our analysis suggests that perceptions of disorder shape fear of crime. We \nacknowledge, however, that the arrow of influence can be pointed in the other direction (Jackson et al., 2010). \nIndividuals who are already worried about falling victim of crime \u2013 and who are already concerned about levels \nof collective efficacy and the loss of authority and discipline in society \u2013 may be more likely to judge \nambiguous neighbourhood cues as problematic (and were therefore more likely to see their environment as \n\u2018disorderly\u2019) than individuals without these prior worries and concerns. It is for future research to disentangle \nthe potentially reciprocal effects of perceived disorder and fear of crime.  \n11 \n \nThe aim of this paper has been to stimulate empirical and theoretical debate on the relationship \nbetween human emotions, behaviour and public insecurities about crime.  The development of new \nmeasures of fear is, however, the first in many potential steps forward. We recognise, for example, \nthat cross-sectional survey research into the fear of crime \u2013 like the present study \u2013 tends to portray \nthe topic as a static creature. While cross sectional data provides a useful first step in illuminating \nimportant ideas, results from such data are often provisional. For example, the research herein \nsuggests that there are several groups of people, some who fear crime \u201ca lot\u201d, or \u201cnot much\u201d and in \nsome instances \u201cnot at all.\u201d  \nIt might thus appear that our respondents fit neatly into one of five different groups in terms \nof their worries or anxieties and the nature of the behaviours they adopt in response.  But this only \ntells us half the story; does group membership operate as temporary or stable variable over time? It is \nlikely that at one stage in an individual\u2019s life they might successfully manage their sense of risk, with \noccasional worries or anxieties motivating seemingly efficacious precautionary activity. At another \nstage, worry and anxiety might \u2018tip over\u2019 into negative outcomes \u2013 and drain their sense of well-\nbeing. Fear of crime may also be a reciprocal process, where an individual becomes sensitised to \ndisorderly cues in the environment, and where perceptions of neighbourhood disorder in turn \npenetrate their assessment of the environment \u2013 maintaining or even elevating anxieties about crime \n(Jackson et al., 2010). \n Other pertinent questions relating to the fear of crime turn out, on closer inspection, to contain \na temporal element. For example, is worry about crime a rare \u2018event\u2019 that takes place say once or \ntwice a year, or are some people more likely to experience worry every day? Is worry experienced on \na cyclical basis with worrying episodes concentrated at weekends rather than weekdays? Are people \nwho worry frequently able to develop \u2018resilience\u2019 through the adoption of behaviours which minimise \nthe negative effects of these emotions?  \nResearch which is able to include a dynamic and temporal perspective would allow us to \nconsider how time impacts emotional responses to crime. Questions concerning the passage of time \u2013 \nover a day, a season or other relevant period of time or even the life-course are most directly \naddressed with \u2018repeated measures\u2019 and panel data, and are only poorly addressed with cross-sectional \ndata.  Similarly, questions about behaviour change are most accurately addressed by data on the same \nindividuals on a repeated basis. In short, the inclusion of information that goes beyond static self-\nreports offers much promise for a more nuanced understanding of fear about crime.  \nNotably, other researchers have found inspiration from cross-sectional surveys and \nsubsequently adapted and honed their methods to discover new conceptual avenues within fear of \ncrime research. One relevant example is Genn (1988), who revisited (and temporarily lived with) a \nsub-sample of women identified from a large-scale survey (Sparks et al 1977) who had claimed to \nhave been victimised multiple times. She provided a remarkable account of the way that the lives of \nthese women were blighted by frequent domestic sexual and physical assaults. In addition to this \ntheoretical insight, she raised important methodological questions about the need for research to \nrecognise the temporal process of emotional development; \u201cIt is clear that violent victimisation may \noften be better conceptualised as a process rather than a series of discrete events. This is most evident \nin cases of prolonged and habitual domestic violence, but there are also other situations in which \nviolence, abuse and petty theft are an integral part of victims\u2019 day to day existence\u201d (1988:91).   \nThinking specifically about our research, one question that we are unable to answer with \ncross-sectional survey data, is to what extent the new frequency of fear estimates may fluctuate over \ntime, within individuals. We believe that the frequency questions are better at capturing \u2018experiences\u2019 \nof worry about crime, while standard questions are more likely to be measuring aspects of the fear of \ncrime concept - including broader attitudes or judgements about crime. But, if the culture of \u2018high \ncrime\u2019 societies is the product of long term social change, cultural adaptations and a resultant \u2018crime \ncomplex\u201913, it is conceivable that entrenched \u2018attitudes\u2019 will be more resistant to change than those \n                                                 \n13 Garland states: \u201cthe development of a crime complex produces a series of psychological and social effects that \nexert an influence upon politics and policy. Citizens became crime-conscious, attuned to the crime problem, and \nmany exhibit high levels of fear and anxiety. They are caught up in institutions and daily practices that require \nthem to take on the identity of actual or potential crime victims, and to think, feel, and act accordingly\u201d \n(2001:164). \n12 \n \neveryday experiences of worry \u2013 as \u2018worry\u2019 may vary more rapidly in response to everyday stimulus. \nIn sum, the two different measures may not only capture different aspects of fear of crime, but it is \npossible that these measures may also behave very differently over time.  \nBut how, exactly, should we measure the dynamic qualities of the frequency of crime related \nworries? Farrall et al. (2009) found that worry was in fact a rare event in many people\u2019s lives14 which \nmay complicate decisions about the length of any study period.  Yet interestingly, the authors also \nidentified a small but theoretically interesting \u2018frequently worried\u2019 group; 9% of those who worried \nabout robbery, worried on average more than once a week (52 or more times).15  For these individuals \n\u2013 who were more likely to live in high-crime areas, have direct or indirect experience of victimization \nand reported that their quality of life was negatively affected by crime \u2013 worry over one\u2019s personal \nsafety was a recurrent and, sadly, familiar experience. It is possible that this group of people, once \nidentified, could be revisited to complete short-term diaries to study micro fluctuations in their \neveryday emotions.  A method that is more common in psychology, \u2018day reconstruction\u2019, asks \nparticipants to recall the previous day by completing a structured self-administered questionnaire or \ndiary entry. This method helps participants remember how they felt through each day and record any \nsubsequent emotional responses or behaviours. The advantage of diary-based data lies in the reduction \nin recall and measurement errors \u2013 and with it, the increase in validity and reliability.  In addition, \nsuch data could potentially reveal whether fear of crime took place on a constant basis throughout the \nday, whether it was concentrated at certain times or in particular places and even how the feelings \nwere managed by the individual (for an example see Scherer et al., 2004). \nYet, the vast majority of people do not experience worrying episodes about crime on a \nfrequent enough basis to warrant the use of diary methods. For most sample members, where the \nimpact of crime is likely to unfold over a longer period of time, longitudinal panel or cohort designs \nwould facilitate an examination of individual and group behaviour.16 These studies, which collect data \nfrom a subject periodically in \u2018waves\u2019 or \u2018sweeps\u2019, are particularly informative when change is \nexamined during key individual or social transition points (e.g., becoming employed, a parent or a \nvictim of crime; a change of government or during war). They are able to address some of the most \nchallenging research questions \u2013 helping to determine the antecedents, correlates and consequences of \na phenomenon.  They can also evaluate whether individuals differ in these processes, and if so, \ndetermine the sources of the individual differences. At the same time, this methodology can capture \ngroup statistics to examine development at an aggregate level.  \nRecent analytic developments in relation to longitudinal data also allow much greater \nheadway to be made in teasing apart the relative contributions of multiple variables to create stronger \ncausal inferences (see Nagin, 2005). For example, longitudinal analysis can incorporate multivariate \nor higher order specifications, multiple populations, accelerated data collection, non-linear and \ninteractive effects, multilevel or hierarchical structures and complex relations including recursive and \nnon-recursive relationships. In short, self-reported cross-sectional data are no substitute for \nlongitudinal designs that utilise more sophisticated methodological approaches.   \nDespite the advantages of longitudinal research, most studies concerning public insecurities \nabout crime do not take a life-course approach.17 The financial cost, time investment and \nmethodological complexity of these studies make them a significant undertaking (see Menard, 1991 \nfor a full review of the method).  However, we believe developmental processes have much to offer \n                                                 \n14 In their study, 85% of people had not worried about robbery in the previous 12 months, of those who had \nworried, 60% had worried less than once a month (1-11 times). \n15 The range of worries about robbery in the past 12 months went from 52 \u2013 365, suggesting that for some \npeople it was a daily occurrence (Farrall et al., 2009).  \n16 In the 1980s there were a series of debates between Hirschi and Gottfredson and various others about the \nrelative merits of longitudinal research on criminal careers. We have no intention of continuing that (or a \nsimilar) debate, and take it as self-evident that the insights into criminal careers gained from longitudinal \nresearch have been so vast, and of such policy relevance as being enough to warrant a general acceptance of the \nvalue of this style of research.  \n17 A number of notable exceptions are Robinson et al, 2003; Stafford et al. 2007; Jackson & Stafford, 2009, \nwhich involve longitudinal designs. The US National Crime Survey also has a revolving panel design, with \nsome subjects being retained for a period of time before dropped and replaced by other subjects.  \n13 \n \nand should become more salient features of the ways in which we understand and conceptualise \nemotional responses to crime. \nIt is also possible to apply longitudinal designs to qualitative data. Qualitative longitudinal \nresearch (Holland and Thompson. 2004; Farrall, 2006) consists of in-depth interview based work \nwhich returns to interviewees to explore incremental emotional changes and the processes associated \nwith these developments. The emphasis is on shifts in meaning, self-awareness and identity and the \nlegacy of key events for respondents (e.g. victimisation, contact with the police, and so forth). Such \nmethods may throw light on how an individual\u2019s feelings about crime interact with other stimulus and \nhow worries are managed within their everyday life. These methods are particularly valuable if one \nwishes to take a psycho-social or narrative approach to emotional management.  We recommend \nfuture longitudinal qualitative research that pays special attention to dysfunctional and functional \nelements and the various emotional experiences that \u2018spike up\u2019 and \u2018bubble away.\u2019  \n \nConclusions \nEmotions shape our beliefs, our relationship with others, and the ways in which we operate in private \nand public spaces. Emotions about crime impart important information about how we feel about our \nneighbours, communities and culture. They can also influence our perceptions of the social world, and \naffect our quality of life and our physical and psychological health. We have sought to demonstrate \nnew methods for investigating fear of crime. Combining two recent advances in survey measurement \n(Farrall et al., 2009; Jackson and Gray, 2010), we have disentangled different manifestations of \u2018fear \nof crime\u2019 \u2013 to illuminate the light and shade, the positive and negative, and the emotional costs and \nbenefits which accompany public responses to crime. This is not to suggest that the types of worry \ndiscussed are not related to one another. Fear of crime involves a variety of ways of negotiating the \nsocial and cultural environment and arises out of lay judgements of risk. However, the manner in \nwhich information about crime is processed, understood and acted upon can vary in its severity and \nimpact on our daily lives, and it is these details we have sought to uncover.   \nThe new index allowed us to differentiate between those who felt at immediate risk of \nvictimisation, and those who expressed more diffuse concerns about crime and society. Because the \nscale also integrated precautionary activity that could be subsumed into everyday life, it was possible \nto assess the everyday emotional costs of fear of crime.  The benefit of our new categorisation is that \nit is neither unduly simplistic nor subjective, but is able to disentangle crucial emotional and \nbehavioural corollaries of crime-fears at an aggregate level. Such methods can be applied to large \nscale research, and thus provide opportunities to understand complex patterns of emotional and \nbehavioural responses to public insecurity.   \nOf particular policy relevance was the evidence that certain precautionary behaviours allowed \nindividuals to successfully manage their worries about crime, without having a negative impact on \ntheir quality of life. Likewise, the \u2018dysfunctional worry\u2019 category emerged as a group of considerable \nsignificance; worry about crime for these individuals was accompanied a damaging sequence of \npersonal and social problems. Their worries were not relieved by their precautions, their quality of life \nwas damaged on account of the insurmountable nature of their crime-fears; they were more likely to \nbe recent victims of crime, to suffer ill-health or disability and to have weak connections with their \ncommunity - which was perceived to suffer the ill-effects of moral decline and disorder. Perhaps the \nresult of longer-term social disadvantage or neglect, this group of people were particularly vulnerable \nto the hard edges of crime and disorder.  \nFollowing previous research, we uncovered links between fear of crime and heightened \nperceptions of neighbourhood disorder, concerns about collective efficacy and moral decline. These \nresults chime with the idea that fear of crime absorbs people\u2019s understandings of social order, justice \nand community cohesion. Indeed, the desire to establish neighbourhood security is multifarious and \nhighly political. Some of these responses contribute to fear as a \u2018social problem\u2019: the individual and \nthe community can be negatively affected by feelings of threat and vulnerability, the restriction of \ndaily activities and damaged social trust. It is apposite therefore, that criminologists and policy \nmakers seek to measure how and why fear of crime impacts individuals and communities. With \nimproved precision and better research design, we believe it is possible to generate yet more dynamic \nand thoughtful considerations of this topic.   \n14 \n \nFunding: This work was supported by The London Metropolitan Police Service.   \n15 \n \nAcknowledgements: We are grateful for the comments of two anonymous referees and of the Editor \nin Cheif of the British Journal of Criminology.  \n \n16 \n \nReferences \nBorkovec, T.D.

First, social cohesion was measured by asking respondents whether they agreed or \ndisagreed (using a 5-point scale) with the following statements: \n \n\u2022 People around here are willing to help their neighbours; \n\u2022 This is a close-knit neighbourhood; and, \n\u2022 People in this neighbourhood can be trusted. \n \nSecond, perception of informal social control was measured by asking respondents whether \nthey agreed or disagreed (using a 5-point scale) with the following statements: \n \n\u2022 If I sensed trouble whilst in this area, I could \u2018raise\u2019 attention from people who live here for \nhelp; \n\u2022 The people who live here can be relied upon to call the police if someone is acting \nsuspiciously; and, \n\u2022 If any of the children or young people around here are causing trouble, local people will tell \nthem off. \n \nAs in previous research (e.g. Jackson and Gray, 2010), a scale of public perception of collective \nefficacy was created by linking (a) mutual trust and shared expectations among residents, and (b) the \nshared willingness to intervene to defend social order.  \nBroader relational concerns were broken down into concerns about a decline in moral values \nand concerns about long-term social change in the community. Concerns about moral decline (or \nconservative views of moral living, see Dowds and Ahrendt, 1995) were measured by asking \nrespondents to agree or disagree (five-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree) to each of \nthe following statements: \n \n\u2022 Young people today don\u2019t have enough respect for traditional British values; \n\u2022 People who break the law should be given stiffer sentences; and, \n\u2022 Schools should teach children to obey authority. \n \nConcerns about long-term change in the community were measured by asking respondents whether \nthey thought each of the following had increased, not changed or decreased since they had lived in the \nlocal area (five-point scale): \n \n\u2022 A sense of belonging to the community;  \n\u2022 A sense of shared values amongst people who live here; and, \n\u2022 A sense of right and wrong amongst people who live here.   \n"}
