It is clear from this review that in both \npre- and post-demographic transition societies family matters: the presence of certain \nrelatives improves child survival and well-being, though which relatives matter differs \nbetween populations. This provides support for the hypothesis that humans are cooperative \nbreeders: mothers cannot raise children alone but need help from other individuals to support \ntheir reproduction. We then go on to review the evidence that relatives matter for women\u2018s \nfertility outcomes. The picture here is less clear cut, but again suggests that the presence of \nparents or parents-in-law affects outcomes such as age at first birth and length of birth \nintervals. Overall this survey suggests that women are influenced by, and reliant on, their kin \nduring their reproductive lives, so that changing patterns of association with kin may have a \ncausal role to play in the demographic transition. The implications of these still changing \npatterns of kin association and child-raising relate not only to the effect they may have on \nfuture demographic change, but also to how children are socialised and what effect this may \nhave on future social change. \n \n 3 \nIntroduction \nHillary Clinton may have popularised the proverb \u2017it takes a village to raise a child\u2018 in her \n1996 book, but interest in who raises children had been widespread among both \ndemographers and anthropologists for some time by the late 1990s. Part of this interest stems \nfrom the potential effects of child-rearing patterns on fertility rates. Women who can rely on \nothers for support in caring for children during their reproductive years can spare more time \nand energy for giving birth to more children. Support from others may therefore be critical \nfor high fertility rates. While both demographers and anthropologists have acknowledged this \nto some degree, the two disciplines have tended to focus on different helpers. The \ncontribution of older children to the household economy has long been of interest to the \ndemographic community, arising particularly from Caldwell\u2018s influential wealth flows \nhypothesis: he argued that when children contribute to the household economy fertility is \nhigh, but fertility falls as modernisation results in children becoming an economic burden \nrather than an economic asset (Caldwell 1978). Research in the 1970s demonstrated that \nchildren do indeed contribute substantial labour to the household economy in high fertility \nsocieties (Cain 1977). A recent resurgence of interest in this topic convincingly argued that \nparents may only be able to sustain high fertility rates by making use of the labour of older \nchildren, even though each child is overall a net drain on the household economy (Lee and \nKramer 2002; Kramer 2005).  \n \nEvolutionary anthropologists, taking a comparative cross-species perspective, were typically \nmore interested in men, and for a long time argued that contributions from fathers are the key \nfactor which distinguish human child-rearing from that of closely related primate species \n(Lovejoy 1981). More recently, however, evolutionary researchers have broadened their \nfocus, and over the last decade or so have begun to develop the hypothesis that humans are \n 4 \ncooperative breeders, a relatively unusual breeding system in which mothers receive help \nfrom many other individuals in raising offspring (Hrdy 2009). While this help may \nsometimes come from fathers, or other men (Hill and Hurtado 2009), more reliable helpers \nare likely to be relatives of the woman, particularly her own mother and older children \n(Hawkes, O'Connell, and Blurton Jones 1989; Turke 1988). Overall, however, the \ncooperative breeding hypothesis suggests that the best strategy is a very flexible one, \nwhereby women co-opt a wide range of other individuals, including men, her own kin and \nher husband\u2018s kin into helping raise children, depending on who is available and willing to \nhelp (Hrdy 2005). This cooperative breeding hypothesis suggests that where women receive \nlittle help in raising offspring, they will reduce family size, since they cannot rear large \nfamilies alone \u2013 thus potentially contributing part of the explanation for the demographic \ntransition (Draper 1989, Turke 1989). This hypothesis dovetails with (and indeed built on) \nearlier work by demographers, who observed that fertility tends to be higher in couples living \nin extended families, compared to those living without the support and influence of kin in \nnuclear family households (e.g. Davis and Blake 1956: see Burch 1970 for a critical review \nof this early literature on family structure and fertility).  \n \nThis paper will review the evidence that humans do receive important help from other \nindividuals in raising children, by drawing together empirical evidence that the availability of \nfamily members affects child health and well-being, and female fertility rates. The first \nsection of the paper will concentrate on the evidence for the effects of kin on child survival in \npre-demographic transition societies. The second section will tackle the effects of kin on \nchildren in post-transition societies. The third will present evidence that kin may affect \nfertility rates.  \n \n 5 \nKin effects in pre-transition societies \nIf family members are helping women to raise children, then there should be evidence that \nthe presence of family members improves child health and well-being. Since child survival is \na fairly unambiguous signal of health and well-being, we have focussed here on studies \nwhich have investigated the effects of relatives on child survival. We concentrate on studies \nwhich look at the effects of named family members on the probability of child survival, since, \nas well as the fact of help itself, we are also interested in finding out who helps. We have \ndrawn together all published studies which have investigated the effects of fathers, maternal \nand paternal grandmothers, maternal and paternal grandfathers, and older siblings of the child \non child survival. We found 37 populations where the effect of the presence of at least one \nrelative, apart from the mother, has been correlated with child survival rates (Tables 1-3, \nFigure 1: all tables slightly updated from Sear and Mace 2008, where a more detailed \ndiscussion of this dataset can be found). All are populations with high mortality and fertility \nrates. These studies are divided into two groups. Table 1 shows those studies where at least \nreasonably sophisticated statistical analysis was used to examine these correlations: at a \nminimum these studies used multivariate analysis so that potentially confounding factors \ncould be controlled for. Table 2 shows studies which only demonstrated a simple bivariate \ncorrelation between the presence of relatives and children. Table 3 provides a summary of \nTables 1 and 2. A \u2017+\u2018 in Tables 1 and 2 indicates that the presence of that relative improved \nchild survival, \u2017none\u2018 indicates no effect, a \u2017\u2013\u2017 indicates the presence of that relative reduced \nchild survival.  \n \nWe include fathers in the table, since there is debate in the literature about exactly how much \nmen help and what they do for children (see e.g. Winking 2006). In a previous study, we also \ncollated published data on the 32 studies which have investigated the effects of the presence \n 6 \nof the mother on child survival. All 32 found, unsurprisingly, that the absence of the mother \nwas correlated with lower child survival (summarised in Table 3: see Sear and Mace 2008 for \nmore details; the additional studies not included in Sear and Mace 2008 are Oris, Derosas and \nBreschi 2004, Penn and Smith 2007, van Bodegom et al 2010 and Willf\u00fchr 2009). However, \nthis mother effect declined with the age of the child in all populations where an age \ninteraction was investigated, and older children often appeared to have rather high survival \nchances even in the absence of the mother. A number of these studies found that children as \nyoung as two years old apparently suffered no higher mortality in the absence of the mother, \nsuggesting that other individuals must be stepping in to help these motherless children out \n(Sear, Mace, and McGregor 2000; Zaba et al. 2005; Masmas et al. 2004; Andersson, \nH\u00f6gberg, and \u00c5kerman 1996). The data presented in Tables 1 and 2 suggest who those other \nindividuals might be. \n \nThe first thing to note from these data is the number of \u2017+\u2018s that appear in the tables. In the \nmajority of the studies at least one relative appears to be positively correlated with child \nsurvival (in fact, in all cases where the presence of two or more relatives was examined, at \nleast one relative was found to be important \u2013 the exceptions which found no correlations \nwere studies which only looked at the effect of either the father or the paternal grandmother). \nWhich relatives are correlated with higher child survival differs between populations, \nhowever. One of the most reliable helpers is the maternal grandmother: in more than two-\nthirds of cases her presence improved child survival rates. Paternal grandmothers were also \noften associated with positive survival outcomes, though somewhat less consistently: in just \nover half of cases they improved child survival. Numerically, the most consistently positive \nrelative were older siblings of the child (beneficial in over 80% of cases). However, there \nwere rather few studies in this category (n=6) because we used a fairly restricted definition of \n 7 \nolder siblings: only older siblings we thought were potential \u2017helpers-at-the-nest\u2018 were \nincluded, that is, siblings several years older than the child (exact definition depends on \nstudy). Siblings close in age are more likely to be in competition with one another for \nhousehold resources, and several studies find a detrimental effect of having elder siblings on \nchild mortality when all siblings are considered (e.g. Muhuri and Menken 1997).  \n \nFathers were rather unimportant: in only just over a third of all cases did they improve child \nsurvival, though this proportion rises to half if only statistically sophisticated studies were \nincluded. Grandfathers on the whole made little difference. Maternal grandfathers showed \nfew correlations with child survival. Paternal grandfathers were roughly evenly split between \nthose studies where a difference was found and those where they had no effect. But in those \nstudies where paternal grandfathers did matter, in more than half of cases they actually \nreduced, rather than improved, child survival rates. It is also worth noting that not even \ngrandmothers or fathers were always beneficial to children. One study found the presence of \nfathers increased the mortality of girls (rural Ethiopia: Gibson 2008); one found a detrimental \neffect of maternal grandmothers (rural Malawi: Sear 2008); and two found detrimental effects \nof paternal grandmothers (historical studies in Germany and Japan: Beise 2002; Sorenson \nJamison et al. 2002). Family relationships may sometimes be characterised by conflict, rather \nthan cooperation. \n \nWe conclude from this survey that the evidence does support the hypothesis that humans are \ncooperative breeders. Children do better in the presence of certain relatives, including \ngrandmothers, older siblings and, occasionally, fathers. Data on kin effects on the survival \nrates of children may even underestimate the effects of relatives since mortality is an extreme \nindicator of child well-being. For example, in the Spanish study included in Table 2, though \n 8 \nfathers had little effect on the survival of their young children, teenage boys were shorter in \nthe absence of fathers (Reher and Gonz\u00e1lez-Qui\u00f1ones 2003). We note some caveats, \nhowever. First, a review such as this based on published literature inevitably runs the risk that \nstudies which find positive associations between relatives and child survival may be more \nlikely to be published than those which find no associations. We hope this problem is not too \nsevere in this case, at least partly because many authors have included a wide range of \nrelatives in their analysis and published the results whether positive or null. A second \nproblem is that the studies we have presented show correlations between the presence of \nrelatives and child survival, not necessarily causal relationships. The studies in Table 1, at \nleast, attempt to control for some potentially confounding factors (e.g. maternal age, which is \nlikely to be correlated both with child survival and the probability that a child has a living \ngrandparent; a number also control for heterogeneity between mothers in child survival). But \nmany studies use the survival status of relatives as a proxy for whether they are available to \nhelp mothers, and it is possible that shared genes or shared environment might result in \npositive associations between the survival of children and their relatives. Such a possibility is \ndifficult to exclude entirely, but many of the studies in Table 1 have demonstrated that only \nsome relatives are correlated with child survival and not others. If shared genes or \nenvironment were the explanation then one might expect to see positive correlations with all \nrelatives not just some. Further, some studies investigated whether the effects vary by age or \nby sex of child. In the Gambia (Sear, Mace, and McGregor 2000; Sear et al. 2002), historical \nGermany (Beise 2002) and Canada (Beise 2005), grandmaternal effects are age-specific. In \nEthiopia (Gibson and Mace 2005), Malawi (Sear 2008) and Japan (Sorenson Jamison et al. \n2002), the effects of paternal grandmothers are sex-specific (see Fox et al 2010 for a \nhypothesis to explain why grandmaternal effects are sex-specific). Again, if shared genes or \n 9 \nenvironment were the explanation, these effects might be expected to be seen at all ages and \nfor both sexes.  \n \nMore convincing evidence that kin do indeed help would be detailed research on what exactly \nit is that relatives do within the household. A handful of studies in Table 1 also collected \nadditional data which supports the hypothesis that kin are actively helping mothers out. \nUsefully, the study in rural Ethiopia collected time-budget data on what individuals within \nthe household were actually doing (Gibson and Mace 2005). This research found that \ngrandmothers were contributing household labour, though maternal grandmothers tended to \nhelp out with heavy domestic tasks, paternal grandmothers with agricultural labour. The \nproductive nature of grandmothers has been confirmed in other African agricultural (Bock \nand Johnson 2008) and hunter-gatherer societies (Hawkes, O'Connell, and Blurton Jones \n1989) Similarly, recent empirical work, including a reanalysis of Cain\u2018s original data, has \nconfirmed that children do contribute both domestic and productive labour to the household \n(Robinson, Lee, and Kramer 2008; Kaplan 1994).  \n \nRelatives may also help out directly with childcare. Earlier research in the Gambian \npopulation included in Table 1 demonstrated that maternal grandmothers have an important \nrole in childcare when children are weaned: mothers send children away to a relative during \nthis period so that they will \u2017forget the breast\u2018, and the majority of children are sent away to \ntheir maternal grandmother (Thompson and Rahman 1967). It is notable therefore, that the \neffect of maternal grandmothers in this population was seen around the time of weaning, but \nnot before. Several other behavioural studies by anthropologists have confirmed that \nindividuals other than the mother are frequently heavily involved in caring for children. \nAmong two different forager groups in Central Africa (Ivey 2000; Fouts and Brookshire \n 10 \n2009), infants actually spend more time in allomaternal care than maternal care; one of these \nstudies found infants were cared for, on average, by 24 individuals (Ivey 2000). In an agro-\npastoralist African population, the quality of allomaternal care was found to be high whether \nor not the mother was present, such that the distress of the infant did not increase during the \nmother\u2018s absence (Borgerhoff Mulder and Milton 1985). That kin are the most important \nhelpers is suggested by further studies among both Martu aborigines in Australia and Hadza \nhunter-gatherers in Tanzania finding that the degree of genetic relatedness affected both the \nprobability of caring for infants, and the intensiveness of care: more closely related \nindividuals do more care and more intensive care (Scelza 2009; Crittenden and Marlowe \n2008).  \n \nQualitative research has also demonstrated that grandmothers, in particular, seem to have \ninfluential roles around the perinatal period and in child feeding practices, by giving advice \nand practical support, which may provide a mechanism for affecting child survival rates. \nDouglass and McGadney-Douglass (2008) found that Ghanian grandmothers (usually, though \nnot always, paternal) played an important role in improving child survival rates from \nKwashiorkor, by recognising illness and ensuring the child\u2018s parents complied with the daily \nregime of nutritional treatment. In Northern Malawi (Bezner Kerr et al. 2008) and Nepal \n(Masvie 2007) paternal grandmothers are influential in perinatal care (for example, assisting \ndelivery) and child feeding practices. A community health programme in Senegal \ndemonstrated that including grandmothers in programmes aimed at improving nutritional \npractices related to pregnancy and infant feeding was successful in improving these practices \namong reproductive-aged women (Aubel, Toure, and Diagne 2004, in whose population \"A \nhome without a grandmother is like a house without a roof\"). Sharma and Kanani (2006) \nfound that grandmothers appeared to improve the calorie and nutrient intake of children \n 11 \n(especially aged 6-11 months) leading to improvements in nutritional status. Such helpful \npractices surrounding child feeding may be part of the reason why the positive effects of \nrelatives on child survival in both Ethiopian and Gambian studies in Table 1 were mirrored \nby positive effects on nutritional status (Sear and Mace 2009; Sear, Mace, and McGregor \n2000; Gibson and Mace 2005).  \n \nGrandparental effects in post-transition societies \nIn our survey of kin effects in post-transition societies, we have chosen to focus on the effects \nof grandparents. There is a large literature on the involvement of fathers and their impact on \nchild well-being, overall suggesting fathers may be more important in post- than many pre-\ntransition societies, however this large literature requires a separate review (see Amato and \nRivera 1999; Sigle-Rushton and McLanahan 2004). It is also difficult to analyse the effects of \nolder siblings in post-transition societies since, by definition, far fewer siblings are available \nto provide care in low fertility societies. Moreover, siblings tend to be close in age, thereby \nviolating our principle of only analysing the effects of potential helpers at the nest (who are \nrather older than the focal child), and both social and legal prohibitions, together with \nuniversal and extended education, make sibling contributions to the household economy \nmuch less likely. So we focus here solely on grandparental effects on child well-being. Low \nfertility rates and low childhood mortality rates in post-transition societies make \ngrandparental influences on classic fitness indicators difficult to assess. Rather, because of \nthe low fertility rate and ever increasing investment per child, it is likely grandparental \ninfluences, if they exist at all, will be found in measures of child development such as \npsychological adjustment, mental health, cognitive ability and well-being (see Coall and \nHertwig 2010). \n \n 12 \nExtending a previous review (Coall and Hertwig 2010) to include grandparental effects \nacross a range of family types, we identified 19 articles that examined the influence \ngrandparents have on grandchild outcomes in post-transition societies: 13 examining \ngrandchildren\u2018s psychological adjustment (see table 4), three examining depression (Botcheva \nand Feldman 2004; Ruiz and Silverstein 2007; Silverstein and Ruiz 2006), two examining academic \nachievement (Falbo 1991; Scholl-Perry 1996), and one examining mental and physical \ndevelopment (Tinsley and Parke 1987). The 13 studies exploring grandparental influences on \ngrandchildren\u2018s psychological, social and emotional adjustment form a relatively \nhomogeneous group and will be the focus of this review. \n \nGenerally, the majority of studies (77%) reviewed here suggest grandparents continue to have \na beneficial impact on grandchild development in post-transition societies (see Table 4). \nGrandparental involvement and contact with their grandchildren and the quality of their \nrelationships appear to influence grandchild well-being, specifically psychological \nadjustment. In family situations where fewer parental resources are available (e.g., step and \nsingle parent families) the resources grandparents bring appear to have a stronger positive \nassociation with grandchild well-being (Henderson et al. 2009; Lussier et al. 2002). Having a \ncustodial grandparent seems to result in poorer grandchild outcomes, however, this is likely \nto be a result of the preceding family situation that resulted in the grandparent assuming that \nrole (Pittman 2007). Perhaps surprisingly, three studies have found weak negative \nassociations between grandparental childcare and grandchild outcomes (Cherlin and \nFurstenburg 1986; Fergusson, Maughan, and Golding 2008; Hetherington 1989). \nUnfortunately, none of these studies have been able to consider the quality of childcare \nprovided to establish whether it is grandparental childcare or underlying familial factors that \ncontribute to this association. It is considered more likely that in difficult financial or \n 13 \nbehavioral situations parents are more likely to turn to grandparents for help, rather than \ngrandparental childcare having a negative influence on grandchildren (Cherlin and \nFurstenburg 1986; Hetherington 1989; Pittman 2007).  \n \nLike the role of fathers, in contrast to pre-transition societies, grandfathers in post-transition \nsocieties appear to have an equal if not larger impact on grandchild development than \ngrandmothers. Interestingly, grandfathers appear to have a more positive impact even though \nthey have less contact with grandchildren than grandmothers. This finding may, in part, be \ndue to the availability of family members. For example, in the studies that explicitly chose \nfamilies with a biological mother present and biological father absent, a resident grandfather \nhad a large influence on grandchild development. This may reflect the grandfather assuming \nthe father figure role while the grandmother, usually the maternal grandmother, has a smaller \nrole beyond that of the mother (Oyserman, Radin, and Benn 1993; Radin, Oyserman, and \nBenn 1991). It must be noted, however, that studies focusing on grandmothers, especially co-\nresiding grandmothers, find consistent beneficial influences (e.g., Henderson et al. 2009). \nThere is some evidence that maternal grandparents have a more beneficial effect than \npaternal grandparents (Bridges et al. 2007; Lussier et al. 2002), however, a clear limitation in \nthe post-transition literature is the lack of distinction between grandparent types, which seems \nto be influential in pre-demographic transition societies. \n \nThe effects grandparents have on grandchild development are generally of a small size (but \nsee Henderson et al. 2009; Radin et al. 1991). The fact that these associations are found \nacross grandchild ages, study designs and diverse populations, and generally take into \naccount a range of potential confounding variables adds strength to these findings. At this \npoint it must be emphasized again that the direction of the causal association cannot be \n 14 \nestablished from these correlational studies. From the current literature it cannot be establish \nwhether grandparental investments specifically improve grandchild outcomes. Rarely, is it \npossible to rule out the alternative explanation that grandparents are more attracted to \nfriendly, caring, happy, responsive grandchildren and their increased investment is purely a \nside effect of this interaction. Likewise, it may be that grandchildren live with custodial \ngrandparents when the most difficult of circumstances have befallen a family and these \nconditions, not the grandparents\u2018 investment, influence grandchild development. However, \nthe ability in longitudinal studies to adjust for earlier measures of the grandchild\u2018s \nenvironment and development are showing promise (see Coall and Hertwig 2010). For \nexample, in a longitudinal analysis that controlled for earlier psychological adjustment, \nPittman and Boswell (2007) found that grandchildren who moved into custodial grandparent \nhouseholds demonstrated improved psychological adjustment. Moreover, like the \nethnographic data, these findings are supported by qualitative analyses that show it is not the \ngrandparent-grandchild relationship per se that makes a difference, rather it is what \ngrandparents actually do with their grandchildren that is crucial (see Alawad and \nSonugabarke 1992; Botcheva and Feldman 2004; Griggs et al. 2010; Coall and Hertwig 2010; \nKennedy and Kennedy 1993).  \n \nThe burgeoning field of grandparental investment in post-transition societies does suggest \ngrandparents play a crucial supportive role to mothers and grandchildren reminiscent of that \nfound in many pre-transition societies. With the demographic transition the child outcomes \nhave changed, however, the evidence that grandparents have a positive influence on \ngrandchild development, especially in the trying times of divorce, re-marriage and economic \nhardship, are growing. \n \n 15 \nKin effects on fertility \nSo, kin appear to help women out in both pre- and post-demographic transition societies, but \ndo kin also affect fertility rates? Such help reducing the costs of child-raising may plausibly \naffect fertility rates in both pre- and post-demographic. In pre-transition, poorly-nourished \nsocieties, relieving some of the energetic burden of reproduction from women may result in \nfaster conceptions and higher birth rates. In both types of population, women may be more \ninclined to have children, and have more children, when they are surrounded by supportive \nkin networks, since such support will reduce the costs, or perceived costs, of child-rearing. \nNewson has also proposed that kin may have an active role in encouraging child-bearing, at \nleast when conditions are suitable for successfully raising children, so that social norms may \nbe more pro-natal in situations where women are surrounded by kin (Newson et al. 2007). \nHere, we review those studies which contribute empirical data to the question of whether kin \ninfluence fertility (a more detailed description of this dataset is in preparation: Sear and \nMathews in prep). We restrict our review to published studies which have investigated the \nimpact of the presence of parents or parents-in-law on women\u2018s fertility. We do not include \nthe many studies which have investigated whether sibship size influences fertility, since we \nare keen to restrict our analysis to those kin known to be available to influence a woman\u2018s \nfertility during her reproductive years. We have also only included those studies which \nindicated whether named relatives were available to the woman, rather than including the \nseveral studies which have analysed the effects of family form or household composition on \nfemale fertility (such as living in a nuclear versus extended family), since such analyses also \ndo not provide precise data on which kin are available to influence fertility. We argue that it \nis important to know exactly who is available to women, since different relatives may have \ndifferent roles to play within the household. \n \n 16 \nWe identified 39 populations in which the effects of parents and parents-in-law on female \nfertility has been statistically investigated (Tables 5 and 6 for multivariate and univariate \nstudies respectively, substantially updated from Mace and Sear 2005, and summarised in \nTable 7). Each row in these tables represents a different sample of women: in some cases \nmore than one row relates to the same national population, but the sample of women is \ndifferent in each case; where clearly distinct populations of women were identified in the \nsame study (such as ethnic groups with different postmarital residence patterns) and analysed \nseparately a separate row is devoted to each distinct sample of women. These tables and \nfigure should therefore be interpreted with caution, since this dataset may both over- and \nunder-estimate the effects of kin on fertility (for example, because different samples from the \nsame national population are not necessarily independent datapoints; and because analysing \nlarge national populations may hide kin effects if they are only found in some sections of the \npopulation). A variety of fertility outcomes are included \u2013 mostly age at first birth (in some \nstudies proxied by teenage birth), length of birth intervals and total number of children born \n(which may or may not be restricted to post-reproductive women). A \u2017+\u2018 in Tables 5 and 6 \nrepresents an increase in fertility in the presence of kin (so that + means an earlier age at first \nbirth, shorter birth intervals and higher total number of children born), a \u2017-\u2017 a decrease in \nfertility and \u2017none\u2018 no effect. In this case the relationship of each kin category refers to the \nwoman herself, so that \u2017mothers\u2018 in this table are equivalent to \u2017maternal grandmothers\u2018 in \nTables 1 and 2, etc. Since these studies include both pre- and post-demographic societies, we \nhave divided up Tables 5 and 6 into \u2017high\u2018 (top panels: fairly arbitrarily defined as TFR \u22653) \nand \u2017low\u2018 (bottom panels: TFR < 3) fertility populations.  \n \nThis preliminary survey should be interpreted with due caution: as with the data on child \nwell-being, a review of published empirical findings such as this may be distorted if studies \n 17 \nwhich find significant effects are more likely to get into print, and these studies only \ndemonstrate correlation not causation. The picture for female fertility is a little less clear-cur \nthan that for child survival: Table 5 suggests that the effects of kin on fertility are not always \nconsistent across all measures of fertility. Some conclusions may perhaps be tentatively \ndrawn, however. First, kin effects are again common \u2013 in only 5 (13%) of the 39 populations \nwas there no evidence that parents or parents-in-law influenced fertility. But which relatives \nare important differs somewhat from those important for improving children\u2018s well-being \n(compare Figures 1 and 2). The direction of the effect is also more variable than for child \nmortality: a woman\u2018s parents, in particular, seem to if anything rather more likely to reduce \nthan increase her fertility. Many, but not all, of these parental anti-natal effects can be \nattributed to the protective effects of living with both parents against teenage childbearing in \nlow fertility societies. A woman\u2018s parents-in-law almost invariably increase her fertility, \nthough note here the few studies including parents-in-law in low fertility societies (since \nmany such studies focus on teenage childbearing, which is frequently outside marriage). If \nwe focus on high fertility societies (see Table 7), we can still perhaps very tentatively \nconclude that a woman\u2018s parents-in-law tend to have pro-natal effects, where the effects of a \nwoman\u2018s own parents may be more variable. More data really need to be collected, however, \nbefore such a conclusion can be drawn with any confidence. \n \nA further caveat we should note is that it is more difficult to interpret these fertility results \nthan those on child well-being. While all family members should be interested in improving \nchild health and well-being once they are born (with certain exceptions), whether family \nmembers are interested in increasing or decreasing the number of children produced is more \ndifficult to determine. Giving birth to many, closely spaced children may not be in a woman\u2018s \nbest interest, for example, since it can lead to maternal depletion (Jelliffe and Maddocks \n 18 \n1964). Her husband, however, may be keen to have many children and may desire a higher \nfertility than is optimal from the woman\u2018s point of view (since he does not bear the same \ncosts of reproducing that she does). Studies of fertility preferences in men and women tend to \nshow that, where they differ (and mostly they don\u2018t), men are more pro-natal than women \n(Ratcliffe, Hill, and Walraven 2000; Gebreselassie 2008). A woman\u2018s husband and his family \nmay therefore encourage high fertility, whereas a woman\u2018s own family may attempt to \nprotect her from the high fertility demands of her husband and in-laws, and not encourage \nrapid childbearing (Mace and Colleran 2009; Sear, Mace, and McGregor 2003). Evidence for \nthis hypothesis comes from a recent study in rural Africa which found that a woman\u2018s kin \nmay actually assist her uptake and use of modern contraception, thereby potentially reducing \nher fertility (Borgerhoff Mulder 2009), but perhaps optimising the total output of children to \nmaintain her own health.  \n \nGrandparental childcare and fertility \u2013 post-transition societies \nAs with the analysis of child survival, correlations between the availability of relatives and \nfertility do not necessarily demonstrate causal relationships. We have argued that one \npotential pathway through which parents could influence their children\u2018s fertility is by \nproviding practical help with raising grandchildren, and data collected from post-transition \nsocieties suggests that grandparents still play a pre-eminent role as childcare providers in \npost-transition societies (see Hank and Buber 2009). Despite this, surprisingly few studies \nhave examined in detail these grandparental influences on fertility. Using population-level \ndata Coall and Hertwig (2010) examined the association between total fertility rate and \ngrandparental childcare across ten European countries; we extend their analysis and present it \ngraphically here (see Figure 3 and 4). The percentage of grandparents who took care of their \ngrandchildren, without the presence of their parents, regularly (almost weekly or more often) \n 19 \nor at all (any) over the last 12 months was taken from Hank and Buber\u2018s analysis of the \nSurvey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe. If grandparents rated frequency of child \ncare for more than one of their children, the child who received the most frequent care was \ncounted. Total fertility rates are the 2009 estimates from the CIA\u2018s world fact book (Central \nIntelligence Agency 2009). Figure 3 shows a strong negative association between regular \nchildcare by grandmothers and total fertility rate across Europe (r = -.90) with a slightly \nweaker association for grandfathers (r = -.88 not shown). Perhaps surprisingly this means that \ncountries where grandparents provide less regular care fertility is higher and where a higher \nproportion of grandparents provide regular care the fertility rates are lower. In line with Hank \nand Buber\u2018s interpretation we suggested this reflects the inadequate provision of institutional \nchildcare and support for women to return to work after having a family in countries such as \nGreece and Italy. In these countries it would appear that if women want a career and a family, \ngrandparents must step up to provide regular childcare. Evidence from a German study \nsuggests when state-funded childcare provisioning is inadequate it is this informal childcare \nthat impacts parents\u2018 fertility decisions (Hank and Kreyenfeld 2003). Importantly, \ngrandparental childcare in nations with adequate state-funded childcare has not been crowded \nout it has merely changed. As Figure 4 shows, a higher proportion of grandmothers from the \nhigher fertility nations provide any childcare (r = .82; and for grandfathers r = .66). This \nsuggests that grandparents in the lower fertility Mediterranean countries are less likely to care \nfor their grandchildren at all. A range of cultural, demographic and historical factors could \nconceivably explain this association. However, Hank and Buber (2009) show this association \nholds after adjustment for, among other things, grandparental age, health, lineage, partner \nstatus, employment status, and distance to child\u2018s residence. These analyses suggest that even \nin post-demographic transition societies grandparents still influence classic fitness indicators \nsuch as fertility. \n 20 \n \nConclusion: implications for the demographic transition \u2013 past and future \nThis survey suggests that relatives are clearly beneficial in raising children in pre-transition \nsocieties. Investigating kin effects in post-transition societies is less easy, but the evidence \navailable also broadly suggests having grandparents around does improve child outcomes. \nTentatively, there is also evidence that kin affect fertility, though not always by increasing \nfertility. Does this have any relevance for the demographic transition? The demographic \ntransition tends to follow economic development. As societies move away from a subsistence \neconomy into an industrial wage-based economy, fertility declines. This shift in subsistence \nstrategy tends to be accompanied by changing social networks: individuals often associate \nmore with non-kin and may physically move away from kin to enhance their prospects of \nwork. This doesn\u2018t mean that kin become unimportant, just that the relative significance of, \nand frequency of interactions with, non-kin increase. This reduction in kin-based social \nsupport networks may increase the perceived costs of childrearing, since mothers and parents \nhave to shoulder far more of the burden of childcare than when a large network of helpful kin \nis available. In post-demographic transition societies, it seems that parents still need help to \nraise children: though they may be raising fewer children, a shift from an emphasis on the \nquantity of children to the quality of children means that parents are still investing very \nheavily in their children (Becker 1991; Mace 2007). But in post-demographic societies, \nparents may instead have to rely on non-kin help, such as that bought in or provided by the \nstate, which may be less reliable, of lower quality, or less available compared to a supportive \nnetwork of kin.  \n \nThe availability of kin will also change as societies move through the demographic transition. \nGrandparents may well become more available, as mortality rates decline, but in the later \n 21 \nstages of the demographic transition at least, may also spend a longer period of time in ill-\nhealth and therefore require help from their children rather than being able to provide it. As \nfertility declines, older children will be less available as helpers, and the overall size of kin \nnetworks will also decline, reducing the availability of siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles. \nThe demographic transition undoubtedly has many contributing factors, not all of which will \nnecessarily apply in any one case, but a loosening of kin ties, which increases the costs and \nperceived costs of raising children, is a plausible contributing factor.  \n \nIt has recently been suggested that these changing patterns of kin association and childcare, \nalong with demographic changes, may affect more than just future demography. Children in \ncontemporary developed populations now require much less intense care in order to survive, \nsince child mortality is so low in such societies. They also tend to receive care from a \ndifferent set of individuals than was typical in the past. Hrdy (2009) has proposed that it was \nthe evolution of a cooperative breeding strategy which was responsible for our cognitive \ndivergence from other apes. One of the hallmarks of our species is our ability to \u2017read minds\u2018, \nand empathise with and understand the intentions of others (Tomasello 1999), a characteristic \nwhich, according to Hrdy\u2018s model, arose through the needs of infants to acquire care from a \nvariety of individuals, not just the mother. But Hrdy\u2018s suggestion is that now contemporary, \nlow fertility populations are no longer raising children in cooperative kin networks, our \ncognitive abilities may not develop in the same way, so that our ability to understand and \ncooperate with others may begin to decline (Hrdy 2009). We\u2018ll leave the last, rather gloomy, \nword on the long-term implications of demographic and child-rearing changes to her:  \n \n\u201cTo all the reasons people might have to worry about the future of our species\u2026add one \nmore having to do with just what sort of species our descendants millennia hence might \nbelong to. If empathy and understanding develop only under particular rearing \n 22 \nconditions, and if an ever-increasing proportion of the species fails to encounter those \nconditions but nevertheless survives to reproduce, it won\u2019t matter how valuable the \nunderpinnings for collaboration were in the past. Compassion and the quest for \nemotional connection will fade away as surely as sight in cave-dwelling fish.\u201d  \n         Hrdy, 2009, p293 \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank Ron Lee and David Reher for organising the workshop on Long-term \nimplications of the demographic transition and inviting us to contribute; the participants at \nthe workshop and Monique Borgerhoff Mulder for helpful comments and Ralph Hertwig and \nPaul Mathews for assistance while writing the manuscript.
