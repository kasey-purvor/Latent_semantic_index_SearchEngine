[S0031-9007(98)05610-5]\nPACS numbers: 05.40.+ j, 02.50.\u2013 rThe macroscopic variables characterizing the behavior\nof very many physical systems are fluctuating quantities,\nand the fluctuations often become more pronounced as\nthe system size decreases. The description of their time\ndependent probability laws is a formidable problem for\nwhich no general solution exists. Sometimes, one is inter-\nested mainly in stationary situations such that the one-time\nprobability distribution has reached a time independent\nfunctional form. In such cases, it is well known that the\nsmall amplitude equilibrium fluctuations of stochastic vari-\nables around their stationary points are described by Gauss-\nian distributions whose widths scale with the noise strength\n(which, in the case of thermal systems, corresponds to the\ntemperature). In practice, however, it is often the large\nexcursions of the system variables away from their steady\nvalues that are of greatest physical significance. These\nlarge rare fluctuations are responsible for many important\nphysical phenomena including nucleation at phase transi-\ntions, switching between stable states in optically bistable\nsystems, stochastic resonance, and the dynamics of Brown-\nian ratchets. They are also of crucial importance in chemi-\ncal kinetics where, for example, the reaction rate in thermal\ncharge transfer reactions is largely determined by the sta-\ntistics of large solvent fluctuations.\nThe statistical description of large rare fluctuations is a\ndaunting problem [1\u20133]. One technique that has been used\nextensively to describe them relies on a path-integral for-\nmulation of the probability distribution (see, e.g., [4]). The\n(quasi)stationary probability density for large deviations\nfrom the average can be evaluated in terms of the optimal\npath originating from the neighborhood of the stationary\npoint. A few years ago, a new approach to the investiga-\ntion of large fluctuations was proposed, based on the idea\nof the prehistory distribution [5]. Briefly, this distribution\ncan be defined as follows. Let us consider a system at equi-\nlibrium so that its one-time probability density is given by\nP1sxd. As a consequence of a large fluctuation away from\nits steady value xst, the stochastic variable is observed to\nreach, for the first time at time tf , its final value xf . We are\ninterested in the probability density phsx, t; xf , tfd that the\nsystem passed through a point x, intermediate between xst0031-9007y98y80(11)y2273(4)$15.00and xf , at an earlier time t , tf . We will always consider\nthat either xst , x , xf or xst . x . xf . Where several\nstable points exist, we will be interested in time intervals\nmuch smaller than typical transition times between stable\npoints, so that the termination point xf always lies within\nthe same region of attraction as x and xst.\nBy comparison of the results of analog electronic ex-\nperiments with a path-integral calculation of the prehis-\ntory distribution, Dykman et al. showed [5] that, in the\nlimit of very small noise strength, the time evolution of the\nmaximum of the prehistory distribution follows the theo-\nretically predicted optimal path. Indeed, following the\nmaximum of the prehistory distribution is a convenient\nway of visualizing the optimal path in a real physical sys-\ntem where D \u00de 0. There is a tube of trajectories around\nthe optimal path whose width corresponds to the disper-\nsion of the prehistory distribution. It was noted [5] that,\nfor an overdamped particle moving in a bistable potential\nand subject to additive white noise, the dispersion could\nsometimes exhibit a nonmonotonic evolution with time:\nthis unexpected feature was investigated both analytically\nand through the analog experiments. Subsequent numeri-\ncal simulations corroborated these ideas [6] and allowed\nverification of the analytic results in the limit of very small\nnoise intensity.\nDispersion of the prehistory distribution is important,\nnot only for its own intrinsic interest, but also because it\nprovides a direct measure of how useful the widely used\n(see, e.g., [2\u20134,7]) concept of the optimal path is going\nto be under the given circumstances: small dispersion\nimplies that almost all paths lie close to the (idealized,\nD ! 0) optimal path, and vice versa.\nThe aim of this Letter is to analyze the behavior of the\ndispersion and, in particular, to clarify the relationship be-\ntween its monotonicity and the shape of the potential in\nwhich the Brownian particle is moving. The work was\nprompted in part by the observation in [6] that the dis-\npersion parameter shows a monotonic evolution with time\nalong the optimal path when the termination point in a\nbistable potential is located farther from the local maxi-\nmum of the potential than one of the stable points. Thus,\u00a9 1998 The American Physical Society 2273\nVOLUME 80, NUMBER 11 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 16 MARCH 1998the fact that the potential is bistable does not necessarily\nimply that the dispersion will evolve in a nonmonotonic\nfashion. Let us consider a simple system described by a\nvariable xstd satisfying the Langevin equation (in dimen-\nsionless form)\n\u00d9xstd \u00ad 2U 0sxd 1 jstd , (1)\nwhere Usxd represents a potential and jstd is a Gaussian\nwhite noise with\nkjstdl \u00ad 0, kjstdjssdl \u00ad Ddst 2 sd . (2)\nIn the limit of very small noise strength, the prehistory\ndistribution is of Gaussian form, centered around the\noptimal path,\nphsx, t; xf , tfd \u00ad f2pDsst; xfdg21y2\n3 exp\n\u00b5\n2\nfx 2 xoptst; xfdg2\n2Dsst; xf d\n\u00b6\n, (3)\nwhere the optimal path, xoptst; xfd, is given as the solution\nof\n\u00d9xoptstd \u00ad U 0sxoptd . (4)\nThe width of the Gaussian has been expressed as Dsst; xfd\nso that the dispersion parameter, sst; xf d, is independent\nof the noise strength. It is given by the expression [5]\nssx; xfd \u00ad fU 0sxdg2\nZ xf\nx\ndy fU 0s ydg23,\nx \u00ad xoptst; xfd .\n(5)\nNotice that U 0s yd \u00de 0 for any point inside the integration\ninterval.\nFor bistable potentials, the dispersion parameter as a\nfunction of x can exhibit a nonmonotonic evolution when\nxst , x , xf , xun where xun is the unstable point and\nxst is one of the stable points [5]. This effect becomes\nmore pronounced as the final point xf gets closer to the in-\nstability point. On the other hand, the behavior of ssx; xfd\nis monotonic when xf , x , xst , xun [6]. Clearly, the\nsame holds true if one analyzes fluctuations around the\nother stationary point but with the signs of the inequalities\nreversed. For quartic potentials with a single minimum,\nssx; xf d is monotonic regardless of whether the interval\nof interest is on the right or the left of the minimum. The\nquestion naturally arises, therefore, as to whether or not\nbistability is a necessary condition for the occurrence of\nnonmonotonic behavior of the dispersion parameter. We\nnow point out that this is not, in fact, the case: the existence\nof nonmonotonic behavior is independent of the bistable\/\nmonostable character of the potential. This can be seen\nby considering Eq. (5). Nonmonotonicity of the disper-\nsion occurs if the slope of ssx; xf d is equal to zero at some\npoint within the interval of interest. Equivalently, if for a2274given final point xf there exists at least one solution of the\nequation\n2U 00sxdssx; xf d 2 1 \u00ad 0 (6)\nin the interval sxst, xfd, the dispersion will show a non-\nmonotonic behavior. Here ssx; xfd is given by Eq. (5).\nIf (6) has several solutions, then ssx; xfd will show sev-\neral extrema. If, for a given potential and final termina-\ntion point xf , no solution of (6) exists, then the dispersion\nparameter ssx; xfd will be monotonic.\nTo check these ideas we have carried out experiments\nand numerical simulations of the Langevin equation for\nseveral types of potential. Analog electronic circuits\ndriven by white noise have been constructed [8] to model\nthe equations of interest. Starting with the system in\nthe vicinity of one stable state, successive blocks of xstd\ntime series were digitized with a Microstar DAP3200A\/\n415 ADC (analog-to-digital converter) [9], and examined.\nThe moment at which xstd eventually reached a given\nfinal point xf was recorded, and the path followed by the\nsystem in reaching that point was also recorded. The pro-\ncess was then repeated, so as to build up an ensemble av-\nerage of the paths leading to xf . We have also solved the\nLangevin equation (1) numerically, using standard tech-\nniques [10]: the prehistory distribution and its parameters\nwere obtained through similar procedures to those used\nin the analog experiments, but with an important differ-\nence. As discussed previously, provided that the detailed\nbalance condition holds in the system under study, it can\nbe exploited to evaluate the prehistory distribution in a\nrelatively rapid and efficient manner [6]. For a Markov\nprocess with detailed balance, we can write\nphsx, t; xf , tfd \u00ad w1j1sx, jt 2 tf j; xfd, st , tfd ,\n(7)\nwhich shows that, for times t prior to the final observation\ntime tf , the prehistory distribution can be found from a\nknowledge of the forward conditional probability density.\nRather than waiting for the fluctuating system to arrive\nnaturally at xf as in the analog experiments, therefore, we\nproceed by generating trajectories starting from xf at time\ntf \u00ad 0, and we allow the system to evolve forward in time.\nThe construction of phsx, t; xf , tfd from the resultant sto-\nchastic trajectories is then straightforward. Note that this\ntechnique would not be applicable to systems for which de-\ntailed balance does not hold. This is the case in the model\nanalyzed by Maier and Stein [3]. Even though an equi-\nlibrium distribution exists, the potential conditions are not\nsatisfied for certain values of the parameters characteriz-\ning the model, and the system lacks detailed balance. The\ntechnique is also inadequate for externally driven systems\nwhere a time independent equilibrium distribution does not\nexist. These last two examples, showing that the time-\nreversal symmetry of the fluctuations is broken, have been\nrecently studied in [11].\nVOLUME 80, NUMBER 11 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 16 MARCH 1998As a first explicit example, let us consider the potential\nUsxd \u00ad 2\nx2\n2\n1\nx4\n20\n2 20x , (8)\nwhich is asymmetric around the single minimum located\nat xst \u00ad 5. A numerical analysis of Eq. (6) indicates that\nit has a single solution when xf , xst, while no solution\nexists for xf . xst. Thus, one expects that the prehistory\ndistribution will have a width with a nonmonotonic depen-\ndence on time in the first case, while its behavior should\nbe monotonic when xf . xst. For instance, for xf \u00ad 2.49,\nEq. (6) has a single root at the point x \u00ad 4.14. In Fig. 1,\nwe plot the results of the analog experiments and the nu-\nmerical solution of the Langevin equation for two different\nvalues of xf located on either side of the potential mini-\nmum. Agreement between the results obtained through\nthese very different approaches may be regarded as satis-\nfactory. The analog data reach the abscissa axis slightly\nfarther from the potential minimum than the chosen xf in\neach case on account of the coarse graining in coordinate\nand time introduced by the ADC, which means that there\nis on average some overshoot before a crossing of xf is de-\ntected, and the same effect also causes the maximum value\nof s to be underestimated. The numerical trajectories, by\ncontrast, start from the chosen value of xf in each case\n(prior to the use of time reversal under the detailed balance\ncondition, as discussed above), so there is no possibility of\nan overshoot. The most important feature, clearly shown\nby both the analog and numerical results, is the marked\ndifference in behavior according to whether xf is larger or\nsmaller than xst.\nWhen the final point is to the right of the minimum,\nxf \u00ad 7.0 . xst, the dispersion is monotonic, just as ex-\nFIG. 1. Dispersion parameter for the asymmetric single-\nminimum potential (8) plotted in the inset. Numerical (curves)\nand analog experimental (points) data with D \u00ad 4 are shown\nfor arrivals at two different termination points: xf \u00ad 2.0\n(circles and full curve) and xf \u00ad 7.0 (squares and dashed\ncurve), respectively. At large negative times, the system\napproaches its stationary state at x \u00ad 5 in both cases.pected. When xf \u00ad 2.0 , xst, on the other hand, there is\na clear nonmonotonicity of ssx; xf d. Its maximum occurs\nvery near the theoretically predicted position. Thus, non-\nmonotonic behavior can indeed exist even in the absence of\nan instability point in the potential. It should be mentioned\nthat the matching of the experimental and numerical results\nprovides further [11] corroboration of the expectation that,\nwhen detailed balance holds, the main fluctuational paths\naway from the stable point are time-reversed mirror images\nof the relaxational paths towards it.\nAs a second example, we consider the prehistory prob-\nlem for a more complicated potential that has been used\nto describe several aspects of the dynamics of fluctua-\ntions in SQUIDS (superconducting quantum interference\ndevices) [12]\nUsxd \u00ad 0.15sx 1 2pd2 2 cossxd . (9)\nThis potential has a single minimum at xst \u00ad 22p , about\nwhich it is symmetric, as seen in the inset of Fig. 2. The\nexistence of solutions of Eq. (6) depends upon the location\nof xf . For xf very close to xst, there are no solutions of\nEq. (6), and, therefore, ssx; xf d is monotonic. Actually,\nit follows from Eq. (5) that, regardless of the shape of the\npotential, the dispersion is always monotonic provided that\nxf is sufficiently close to the stable point. Once the final\npoint is sufficiently far from the stable point, however,\nsolutions of Eq. (6) exist. Their number increases as the\ndistance of the observation point from the minimum is\nincreased. A new extremum of the dispersion parameter\nappears corresponding to each of these solutions. In\nFig. 2, we compare the results of the numerical simulations\nand the analog experiments for the potential of Eq. (9), for\na noise strength D \u00ad 2.54 and xf \u00ad 3. This end point\nis far from the minimum of the potential, and Eq. (6)\nFIG. 2. Dispersion parameter for the symmetric single-\nminimum potential (9) plotted in the inset. Numerical (curve)\nand analog experimental (points) data with D \u00ad 2.54 are\nshown for arrivals at xf \u00ad 3. At large negative times, the\nsystem approaches its stationary state at x \u00ad 22p . Only one\nextremum is resolved.2275\nVOLUME 80, NUMBER 11 P HY S I CA L REV I EW LE T T ER S 16 MARCH 1998has three roots located at x1 \u00ad 0.89, x2 \u00ad 20.52, and\nx3 \u00ad 24.41. It is clear from the plots that the dispersion\nparameter shows a very distinct maximum located at x \u00f8\n24, but that the other two predicted extrema do not appear.\nThe shift in the position of the main maximum and the\nabsence of the other two extrema are both attributable\nto the finite value of D used in the experiments. Note\nthat Eq. (6) was derived in the asymptotic D ! 0 limit,\nso that it cannot necessarily be expected to give good\nresults for finite noise values. To test this explanation,\nwe have repeated the numerical experiments for much\nweaker noise intensity, with D \u00ad 1028. The results are\npresented in Fig. 3 in the form of a semilog plot to exhibit\nthe extrema to best advantage. The numerical error can be\nestimated from the technique used (fourth-order Runge-\nKutta with 1000 trajectories, a time step of 0.001, and\na total run time of 15 000), from the total number of\ntrajectories or, perhaps more conveniently, directly from\nthe small statistical deviations that are visible about a\nsmooth curve in the figure. In all cases, one concludes that\nthe numerical uncertainty is considerably smaller than the\ndifference (0.137) between the ssx, xf d values computed\nat the local minimum and the smaller local maximum. It\nis clear, therefore, that for this very small value of D all\nthree extrema are unambiguously resolved.\nIn conclusion, analog experimental and numerical so-\nlutions of Langevin equations show that the dispersion\nparameter of the prehistory distribution as a function of\nposition along the optimal path can have a nonmonotonic\ndependence on x \u00ad xopt, even for monostable, symmet-\nric potentials. The monotonicity property is related to\nthe global aspects of the potential indicated by Eq. (6).\nThe theoretical predictions are asymptotically valid in the\nlimit of very small noise intensity. Experimental data are\nalways obtained for finite noise strength, and their com-\nparison with theoretical predictions requires finite noise\neffects to be properly taken into account. Even for finite\nnoise, the comparison between the numerical and experi-\nmental data can be regarded as very satisfactory. On the\nother hand, stochastic simulations based on the detailed\nbalance property can be carried out for extremely small\nvalues of D. Thus, they provide results which are well\nwithin the asymptotic limit where they can be matched di-\nrectly against theoretical predictions.\nWe acknowledge valuable discussions with M. I.
