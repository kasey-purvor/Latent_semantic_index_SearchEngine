Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \n \nGrapes contain non-flavonoid com-\npounds in the pulp while flavonoid \ncompounds are essentially located in \nthe seeds and skin. An in-depth \nknowledge of the structures of the latter \nis of interest to explain their role in the \nevolution of wine during the \nvinification and aging processes. The \nmain 3-flavonoid monomers in grape \nare (+) catechin and its isomer (-) \nepicatechin. The former (Fig. 1a) has \ntwo benzene cycles bound by a \nsaturated oxygen heterocycle. This \nstructure contains two asymmetrical \ncarbons (C2 and C3) that gave rise to \nfour isomers. Catechins may not be \nconsidered as tannins, as their \nmolecular weight is too low [290.3 for \n(+) catechin] and they have very \nrestricted properties as compared with \ntannins, which have molecular weights \nranging from 600 to 3500. The \nmolecular weight of catechins in their \ndimer form is high enough for binding \nto proteins. Catechins degradation in \nsynthetic wine containing tartaric acid \nand iron traces yields dimers in which \nthe two catechin units (the simplest \nprocyanidin) are bound by an ethane \ngroup (Fig. 1b). These dimers are \ncolourless, but they undergo a fast \nevolution to yellow forms with higher \nabsorption than the products formed by \neither enzymatic oxidation or catechin \nautooxidation (Flanzy, 2000). This \nmechanism seems to play an important \nrole in the non-enzymatic browning of \nwhite wines, which is directly corre-\nlated with flavanoid contents (Flanzy, \n2000). \n \no\nH\nOH\nH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nOH 2\n3\n \n \n \n \nOH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nOH\no\no OH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nOH\nHOOC-CH\n \n \n \n Figure 1. (a) Catechin estructure. (b) \nCatechin dimer involving an ethane bound.   \n \nThere are two common methods for \ndetermining catechin contents in wines. \nThe first method, proposed in 1959 by \nSwain and Hillis for the catechin assays \nin wines and also applied to vinegars \n(a)\n(b)\nInnov.Food Sci.E.Technol., 2002, Vol. 3, 289-293   \n \n3 \n(Garc\u00eda-Parrilla, Heredia, Troncoso & \nGonz\u00e1lez, 1997), is based on chemical \nderivatisation using vanillin to yield a \nquinoid product whose colour ranges \nfrom pale to intense pink-red with an \nabsorption maximum at 500 nm. The \nsecond method is based on HPLC with \ndifferent detectors to obtain levels of \nindividual catechins and procyanidins \ncompounds  (Carando, Teissedre, Pas-\ncual-Mart\u00ednez & Cabanis, 1999). Capil-\nlary electrophoresis is also being used \nat present (Prasongsidh & Skurray, \n1998). There are no references in the \nliterature on flow injection methods for \nthe determination of  catechins.  \nThe objective of this work was to \ndevelop a flow injection method for \ndetermining catechins in their usual \nrange of concentrations in Montilla-\nMoriles white wines (Sherry type) (15-\n35 mgL-1) (Fabios, L\u00f3pez-Toledano, \nMayen, M\u00e9rida & Medina, 2000) and \nred wines (10-100 mgL-1) (Mayen, \nM\u00e9rida & Medina, 1995), showing a \nprecision as required for wineries and \nfaster than the methods used at present. \n \nExperimental \n \nApparatus and instruments  \nThe manifold used is outlined in Fig.2. \nIt was built using a four-channel Gilson \nMinipuls-3 peristaltic pump (Villiers le  \nBel, France) fitted with a rate selector, \ntwo Rheodyne 5041 injection valves \n(one of them acting as selection valve) \n(Elkay, Galway, Ireland), and PTFE \ntubing of 0.5 mm i.d. (Scharlau, \nBarcelona, Spain). A PU 8625 spectro-\nphotometer (Cambridge, UK) equipped \nwith a Hellma 138-QS flow-cell \n(Hellma, Jamaica, NY) and connected \nto a Knauer recorder were also used. \nStatistical treatments were made using \nStatgraphics\u2122 plus for windows 2.1. \n \nReagents and solutions \nFor both the reference and proposed \nmethod, a 0.25 gL-1 catechin solution \n(purity 98%) from Merck (Darmstadt, \nGermany) in ethanol, 37% hydrochloric \nacid, 1 and 2,5% vanillin solutions \n(puity> 99%), respectively, and abso-\nlute ethanol from Panreac (Barcelona, \nSpain) were used.  \nBidistilled water of high purity \nobtained from a Millipore Milli-Q plus \nsystem (Bedford, MA, USA), was used. \n \nReference procedure \nDetermination of catechin (Swain and \nHillis method). A 0.25 gL-1 catechin \nstandard solution was prepared. 0, 1, 2, \n3, 5 and 10 mL of standard solution, 10 \nmL of 37% hydrochloric acid and 5 mL \nof 1% ethanol solution of vanillin were \nmixed in 25-mL flasks. After 20 min \nthe absorbance at 500 nm was \nmeasured in cuvettes of 10-mm path-\nlength. Ten milliliters of white wine \nand aliquots of 10 mL of 1:10 diluted \nred wine were poured instead of the \nstandard solutions and the procedure \nwas applied as described before. Blank \nsamples contained all reagents but \nvanillin. \n \nProposed method \nFigure 2 shows the manifold used for \ncatechins determination. The sample \nwithout dilution was introduced into the \nJ.

Manifold for the determination of catechins. PP= peristaltic pump, q= flow-rate, \nSV= selection valve, IV= injection valve, R= reactor, D= detector, w= waste. \n \nThe pink product of the deriva-\ntisation reaction was monitored at 500 \nnm. After this, the selection valve (SV) \nwas switched to the position for \nintroducing solution 2 (35% HCl) and a \nnew sample aliquot was injected. The \ndifference of absorbance between the \ntwo measurements at 500 nm was \nrelated to the catechins and procyanidin \ncontents. \n \nResults and discussion \n \nOptimisation of the method \nThe variables which affect the method \nfor the determination of catechins were \nstudied by univariate and multivariate \napproaches depending on their inter-\ndependence and the optimum values \nobtained are summarised in Table 1. \n \nChemical variables \nFigure 3 shows a plot of the absorbance \nvalues versus both the hydrochloric \nacid and vanillin concentrations in \nsolution 1. As the P-value in the \nANOVA table is less than 0.05, there is \na statistically significant relationship \nbetween the variables at 95% \nconfidence level. The R-squared \nstatistic indicates that the model ex-\nplains 98,87% of the absorbance \nvariability. The equation of the fitted \nmodel is: A= 0.0470 \u2013 7.68x10-3 [HCl] \n+ 0.0228 [vanillin] + 3.36x10-4 [HCl]2 + \n1.46x10-3 [HCl][vanillin] \u2013 0.071  \n[vanillin]2, where A is expressed in \nmilli-absorbance units and the concen-\ntration of vanillin in % (m\/v).  \n \nTable 1.

In \norder to increase the sensitivity, a 37% \nHCl concentration was chosen for \nfurther experiments. The range of \nvanillin concentrations studied showed \nthat there were small differences in the \nabsorbance when concentrations higher \nthan 0.5% were used. A value of 2.5% \nwas chosen in order to increase the \ninstrument response. The optimum \nconcentration of HCl in the carrier \nstream was 18 % (v\/v). \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Response surface of the multi-\nvariate analysis: evolution of absorbance \nversus hycrochloric acid (%, v\/v) and \nvanillin concentration (%, m\/v) in \nsolution 1. \nFlow injection variables \nThe function of reactor (indicated as R \nin Fig. 2) was to provide both \nappropriate reagent-sample mixture and \nenough development of the deriva-\ntisation reaction before reaching the \ndetector. A length of 75 cm was \nsufficient for these purposes. The flow-\nrate of the reagents was studied in the \nrange 0.4-1.3 mL min-1 at constant \ncarrier flow-rate of 0.4 mL min-1. An \noptimal value of 0.7 mL min-1 was \nfound for q1 (see Fig.2). A flow rate of \n0.4 mL min-1 was selected for the \ncarrier channel (q2) in order to minimise \ndispersion. The sample volume was \ntested from 50 to 500 \u03bcL and no \nsignificant differences in the \nabsorbance response were found above \n100 \u03bcL. \n \n \nCharacterisation of the method \n \nCalibration curves \nCalibration curves were run using as \nstandard solutions white and red wine \nsamples spiked with known concen-\ntrations of catechin (between 10 and 40 \nmg L-1 and between 10 and 250 mg L-1 \nfor white and red wines, respectively) \nin order to minimise matrix effects. \nEach point in the curves was obtained \nas the average of a triplicate injection. \nLinear responses were found in the \nrange of concentrations studied.

Each result was the average of a \ntriplicate injection. The protocol for \nassessment consisted of studying \nparameters such as traceability with a \nreference method, repeatability, re-\nproducibility, detection and quan-\ntification limits and sample throughput. \nA robustness study was also developed.  \nRepeatability (r). The F-test was \napplied in order to establish if the \ndifferences in repeatability of the \nmethods was significant. With this aim, \nthe Fobs=Sr2 \/ Sref2 was compared with \nthe F1-\u03b1 obtained from F tables for \n\u03b1=0.05 (P=95%). As can be observed \nin Table 2, Fobs<F1-\u03b1, so the repeat-\nabilities of the FI and reference method \nare similar. It is worth to noting that the \nrepeatability of the flow injection meth-\nod is better than that of the reference \nmethod.  \nReproducibility (R) (30 days). \nTable 2 also shows the R values \nobtained as well as the results from the \napplication of the F-test. The repro-\nducibility of the FI method is better \nthan that of the reference method. Both \nmethods are statistically equal.----------. \n \nTable 2.

Table 2 shows that the best \nLOD and LQ correspond to the \nreference method but the values of \nthese parameters in the FI method are \nnot far from those of reference method.   \nTraceability. The traceability of the \nmethods was studied by comparing the \nresults obtained from 30 samples of red \nand white wines analysed by both the \nreference and proposed methods. Fig. 4 \nshows the regression of the flow \ninjection method versus the reference \nmethod for catechins in both red wines \n(Fig. 4a) and white wines (Fig. 4b). The \nregression equations, (A) y= 0.998 x + \n0.462 (r= 0.993) and (B) y= 0.984 x + \n0.451 (r= 0.993) show good correlation \nInnov.Food Sci.E.Technol., 2002, Vol. 3, 289-293   \n \n7 \nbetween data from both methods. \nConfidence limits of 95% are shown in \nthe figure in dotted lines. In both cases \nthe traceability was assured using the t-\ntest.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Correlation graphs of the \nreference method versus the FI method for \nthe determination of catechins in: (A) red \nwine (B) white wine. Confidence interval: \n95%.  \n \nSample throughput. The results in \nTable 2 show that the FI method \nprovides a sampling frequency much \nhigher than that of the reference \nmethod. This is a consequence of the \nnon-equilibrium but fixed-time con-\nditions in which FI measurements are \nperformed. Thus, there is not necessity \nfor waiting until reaction completion.  \nRobustness study. The study was \ndeveloped using the Younden-Steiner \nprocedure. Critical variables of the \nsystem are hydrochloric acid, vanillin \nconcentrations in solution 1 and flow-\nrate. These variables were modified \n\u00b110% of their optimum values. All \nerrors were below 5%, except in the \ncase of hydrochloric, which yields \nchanges of 50% in the analytical signal \nin the range under study. \n \nConclusions \n \nThe proposed method enables the \noverall determination of catechins in \nred and white wine with characteristics \nsimilar or better than those of current \nexisting methods. Thus, the proposed \nmethod is simple, inexpensive, presents \na good correlation with the reference \nmethods commonly used for these \nanalytes and can be easily implemented \nin a winery for monitoring catechins in \nboth white and red wines. Other advan-\ntages of the method are a sampling \nthroughput higher than that of the meth-\nods routinely used in wineries and its \ncapability for either partial or full auto-\nmation.  \nThis method constitutes the unique \napplication of flow injection for the \nJ. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al   \n \n 8 \ndetermination of catechins in white and \nred wines proposed so far and offers the \nadvantage of reducing time and costs.  \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThe Spanish Comisi\u00f3n Interministerial \nde Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CICyT) is \nthanked for financial support (Project \nBQU 2000\/0241).
