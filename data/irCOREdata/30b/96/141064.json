On in real operational machinery it is often only \npractical to take AE measurements from non-rotating members, at or on the bearing housing. \nConsequently, AE signals originating from the rotating shaft will incur significant attenuation across the \ntransmission path to an AE receiver attached at the bearing housing. This can be related to \ninhomogenities and scatterers within the structure, reflections at acoustic boundaries, interference and \nattenuation effects across the bearing interfaces. Moreover, the AE signal will be further coloured by the \ncharacteristic frequency response of the AE transducer itself. In light of these factors, interpretation of \nthe AE signals is not trivial and often departs from the classic AE signal model [6,7]. \n \nIn recent years various signal processing and pattern recognition techniques have been successfully \napplied to AE signals for diagnosing the severity and location of defects in various types of rotating \nmachinery. Notably artificial neural networks (ANN) [8] and clustering [4,9] have been adopted for AE \nsignal classification. Regardless of the classification engine employed, it is invariably identification of \nthe key resolving features or descriptors within the AE signal that is paramount for successful \nclassification. Generally, the size of the feature vector chosen depends upon the specific application and \nrecognition requirements. Previous studies [10] employed relatively large feature vectors for the AE \nsignal classification problem. However, for discriminating between different classes of rub signatures, it \nwas considered useful to define a feature vector with a minimum number of parameters.  \n \nTypical features extracted from AE signatures in condition monitoring include peak or total energy, \nstandard deviation, median, AE counts, r.m.s voltage and duration. However, these are all related to \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n3\nabsolute energy levels of the measured waveform or rely upon pre-set amplitude thresholds. As such, the \nquantities exhibit considerable variability from one bearing measurement to the next and are thus \nextremely dependent upon factors such as background noise, in addition to AE transducer positioning \nand coupling. Consequently, it is believed that such features are not ideal for AE waveform \nclassification, especially in cases where several measurement positions are required. Alternative features \nmore related to the amplitude statistics of the measured AE waveforms and independent of absolute \nenergy levels have also been considered. Notably, the fourth statistical moment known as kurtosis and \nthe ratio of peak to r.m.s voltage known as crest factor have been applied for condition monitoring in \nrotating machinery. However, laboratory tests conducted as part of this research have indicated both of \nthese quantities to be unsuitable for classification.  \n \nIn contrast, it has been shown that modelling an AE signal as an autoregressive stochastic process, as \ndescribed by Melton [11] and later Mba [4], can provide good AE classification results. However, the \nuse of AR coefficients as signal features approximating the shape of the signal has some disadvantages. \nPrimarily, it is always necessary to determine the number of AR coefficients necessary to adequately \nrepresent each AE signal. Although numerous algorithms exist for determining the model order, it \nshould be noted that the classification results could be sensitive to the AR model order. Secondly, it was \nevident from this study that AE signal classification using AR model coefficients was severely impaired \nwhen the measured AE signals was modulated by small levels of background acoustic noise.  \n \nIn light of this discussion, it is postulated that a robust AE signal feature based upon amplitude statistics \nand independent of absolute energy levels or pre-defined thresholds, and less effected by pre-signal \nprocessing, can be a useful addition to AE signal classification. This paper proposes that the standard \nKolmogorov-Smirnov statistic can provide such an AE waveform feature parameter for classifying \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n4\ndifferent types of rubbing in rotating machinery. To demonstrate this, classification results are presented \nfrom rub experiments conducted on a journal bearing test rig that rotates at 1500 rev\/min (rpm). In \naddition, classification performance of this technique was tested by modulating the measured AE signals \nwith background noise taken from bearings of an operational 550 MW turbine unit.   \n \nAcoustic Emission and rubbing in rotating machinery  \n \nFundamentally, a light frictional rub between the central shaft and surrounding stationary components, \nsuch as the seals within a turbine, will cause microscopic perturbation and a transient release of \nbroadband strain energy referred to as Acoustic Emissions. Although originating from a different \nmechanical process, this wave motion is in practice very similar to the wave energy that propagates from \nmicroscopic cracks within solid structures. A number of reasons can be identified for the onset on light \nrubbing in a rotating plant. These include thermal effects, foundation movement, component movement, \nrotor unbalance or misalignment. Regardless of the exact relationship between cause and effect, the \nexistence of rubbing is unwanted as it can often develop into more significant mechanical distress. Two \nmain categories of light rubbing can be identified. Primarily partial rubbing constitutes distinct or \nintermittent rub events occurring instantaneously within the period of the shaft rotation. Secondly \ncontinuous rubbing involves more sustained contact between shaft and surrounding components. \nAlthough the mechanisms by which rub phenomena escalate are complex, it is suggested that for \nmachinery of higher rotational speeds, a high concentration of partial rub events can lead to more \nsustained rubbing, which in turn can induce more serious vibration via mechanisms such as thermal \nbending of the shaft. Consequently, it is considered in this paper that an AE system capable of \ndiagnosing individual partial rub events might promote the early diagnosis of impending mechanical \ndistress.  \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n5\n \nSato [2] reported that AE measurement can provide a valuable complementary tool for diagnosing \nrubbing in fast rotating plant such as turbine generators. For this investigation, signatures were measured \nat frequency bands greater than 100 kHz, overcoming much of the mechanical background noise whilst \nincreasing the probability of direct rub detection. To detect rubbing using AE, it is generally \nadvantageous to minimise both the physical distance and number of interfaces between the location of \nrubbing and the AE receiver. This is because significant acoustic attenuation will occur, especially at \nhigher frequencies (>100 kHz), due to frequency-dependent absorption, geometric spreading losses and \nreflection at interfaces.  In some slow rotating cases, it is possible to place transducers directly on the \nrotating shaft, [4]. However in many types of operational rotating machinery, such as in turbine-\ngenerators, it is only practical to make measurements remotely at the bearing housing. In such cases, AE \nsignals produced by rubbing on the shaft will incur considerable attenuation as the signatures propagate \nalong the shaft surface to the bearing, across an oil film and into the bearing housing. This attenuation \nissue is considered to be the limiting factor for AE in many examples of large-scale machinery. \n \n \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n6\n \nTheory \n \nFigure 1 shows an example AE signal measured at the bearing housing of a test rig whilst rotating at \n1500 rpm. This signature was a result of simulating a partial rub on the shaft with a steel seal fixture. \nClearly, the AE burst shows some resemblance to the shape of a classic AE waveform produced by \ncrack propagation or a Hsu-Nielson source, although it is not possible to identify individual extensional \nand flexural wave modes as can be often obtained by the Modal AE approach in thin plates. A notable \nfeature of this rub waveform is the initial onset of acoustic energy through the succession of initial high \nenergy peaks prior to the exponential decay. Therefore, it might be inferred that useful signal features \nmight include kurtosis or crest factor as they describe the extreme values in the amplitude distribution. \nHowever, investigation of numerous rub signatures has shown considerable inconsistency in these \nparameters under stable experimental conditions. Consequently, they are not considered suitable \nparameters for classifying rubbing. \n \n0 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 0.005 0.006 0.007 0.008 0.009 0.01\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\nTime (\/seconds)\nAm\npli\ntu\nde\n (\/v\nolt\ns)\n \nFig 1  A shaft-seal rub induced AE signal measured at the journal bearing of a test rig. \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n7\nAlternatively, it is conceived that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic [12] might provide a more \nappropriate feature vector for classifying AE rub signals. In essence, this standard goodness-of-fit test \nquantifies the difference between the amplitude statistics of the measured AE signal and a specified \ntheoretical distribution function model. It is defined as the maximum absolute difference (D) between \nthe empirical cumulative distribution function SN2(x) and a hypothesised theoretical distribution function \nSN1(x), see equation (1) \n \n )()(max 21 xSxSD NNx\n\u2212=\n\u221e<<\u221e\u2212  (1) \n \nAs SN1(x) and SN2(x) are non-decreasing and SN2(x) is considered to be constant between the defined \nvalues of amplitude x, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the maximum deviation between the two curves will occur \nat one of the defined observation points x1,x2,x3\u2026xn. It should also be noted that the distribution of D, in \nthe null hypothesis, can be calculated to give the significance of any observed non-zero value of D. \nMoreover the statistic is invariant under re-parametrisation of x. For example, the same significance \nexists under x as for log (x).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2  \u2018D\u2019 is the greatest distance between an empirical distribution Sn2(x) and the theoretical \ndistribution model Sn1(x). \n \n \nThe basic algorithm devised for this paper is summarized in figure 3. Primarily, each digital AE signal \nwas decimated by a factor of 5 to reduce the KS computation time. This decimation was not expected to \ndegrade classification results because of the high initial sampling rate used in the analogue-to-digital \nconvertor (ADC) (4 MHz). Following this stage, theoretical distribution models for each of the AE \nsignals were derived, assuming the null hypothesis that each signal belongs to the candidate family of \ndistributions. These theoretical cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves were derived directly by \nthe method of moments as opposed to a maximum likelihood approach. For example, for the Gaussian \nmodel, the mean \u03bc and variance \u03c32 of each input signal was determined and the model estimate of the \nCDF evaluated using the two parameter given in equation (2).

The classification procedure described was used to assess whether KS features \nassociated with AE signatures was sufficiently robust to cluster known rub classes into the correct \nnatural groups. \n  \nExperimental set-up \n \nA Physical Acoustic Corporation wideband (WD) piezoelectric sensor was employed for this work with \na range of 100 kHz \u2013 1000 kHz. Pre-amplification ranged from 40 to 60dB. The signal output from the \npre-amplifier was connected (i.e. via BNC\/coaxial cable) directly to a commercial data acquisition card \nthat occupies one of the ISA slots within a Pentium host PC. This AEDSP acquisition card provided up \nto 8 MHz sampling rate and incorporated 16-bit precision giving a dynamic range of more than 85 dB. \nPrior to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), the card employed anti-aliasing filters that can be \ncontrolled directly in software.  Moreover, an extended local memory allowed the sequential recording \nof signals containing up to 256,000 samples. This corresponded to the continuous measurement over \nmore than 0.06 s at a sampling rate of 4 MHz. \n \nFigure 4 (a) depicts the rotating test rig. As shown, the shaft is supported by two journal bearings. An \nacoustic wave-guide made contact with the inner bearing housing and the receiving AE sensor was \nattached to the other end, ensuring a direct transmission path.

Figure 4 \n(b) illustrates how partial rubs are simulated using this device. Essentially, a non-concentric dummy \nshaft fixture is attached to the rotor so as to rub against a supported seal fixture on every shaft rotation. \nThe seal fixtures employed were machined in mild steel or brass. The reaction pressure exerted by the \nseal upon the incident shaft was set by masses applied to the rub fixture as shown in Fig. 4(b). These \nmasses applied a force of approximately 140 N throughout the measurements. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 4 (a)  The journal bearing test rig,    (b)  The rub simulation mechanism. \nDrive Motor \n1219mm \n\u2264 3600rpm \nAQUISITION \nSYSTEM \n   A-A \n1 2 3 4 5\n1 \n2 \n  Rub-Simulator\nJournal \nBearing\nJournal \nBearing \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n12\n \nResults and discussion \n \nUsing the aforementioned system, AE signals were recorded for different types of partial shaft-seal \nrubbing. Primarily signals from the partial rubbing of steel and brass seal fixtures were taken. Secondly, \npartial rub signals were taken from three steel seal fixtures exhibiting different states of wear. Finally, \nrub signatures were taken from three seal fixtures with faces of different geometric shape. This section \npresents results pertaining to the use of the KS statistic to classify the defined rub classes by employing \nhierarchical clustering. By comparing the results to alternative AE feature extraction methods, the \npotential of the KS statistic is demonstrated.  \n \nIt must be noted that identically shaped brass and steel seal fixtures were employed, see figure 5. In each \ncase, fifteen AE signatures are recorded under the same experimental conditions, i.e., the shaft period \nand the load applied to the rub simulation mechanism remained constant.  Examples of the AE signals \nproduced from steel and brass seal rubbing are shown in figure 6. \n \n \n \nFigure 5 Steel and brass seal fixtures \n \n \n \n  16mm \n22mm \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n13\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\nx 104\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\nSteel seal fixture\nTime (\/sample no)\nAm\npli\ntu\nde\n (\/v\nolt\ns)\n \n(a) \n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\nx 104\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\nBrass seal fixture\nTime (\/sample no)\nAm\npli\ntu\nde\n (\/v\nolt\ns)\n \n(b) \nFigure 6   Examples of the AE signals produced using (a) steel and (b) brass seal fixture \n \nAppendix A lists mean and standard deviation values for extracted AE features for the example steel and \nbrass signals. The KS values were obtained using the Gaussian, Rayleigh and exponential distribution \nfamilies. Gaussian KS values for each of the signals multiplied by two were also shown and it should be \nnoted that these values are not significantly different to the Gaussian KS values obtained from the \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n14\noriginal signals. Although many established AE signal features were considered, only the r.m.s, median, \nkurtosis and autoregressive (AR) coefficients are detailed as they proved more significant rub indicators.  \n \nPrimarily, use of the KS values derived from the Gaussian model for all thirty signals are considered as \nthe input vector to the clustering algorithm. The achieved clustering results are depicted using the \ndendrogram plot in figure 7. As shown, the x-axis represents the steel fixture rub signals by labels 1 to \n15 and the signals produced using the brass fixture as signals 16 to 30. Moreover, the y-axis shows the \nEuclidean distances between the input KS values. It is evident that the two main clusters discriminate \nbetween the brass and steel rub classes. Moreover, ignoring signal-6 and signal-12 corresponding to \nsteel rubbing, the separation is relatively pronounced. \n \nFigure 7  Gaussian KS discrimination, single-linkage (nearest neighbour) \n \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n15\nThe algorithm used to determine KS values involves the generation of a random reference signal and \nhence produces slight variation in the KS value for a given AE signal over repeated calculation. \nHowever, this variability did not prevent adequate separation between brass and steel signals over many \nindependent experiments.  Moreover, it was apparent that using a signal feature vector that constitutes \nrepeated KS evaluations for a specified reference distribution could improve the clustering results. \nFigure 8 shows the clustering achieved using a feature vector consisting of four independent KS \nevaluations assuming the Gaussian model. In this plot, Ward\u2019s method of clustering is employed in \npreference to the single-linkage (i.e., nearest neighbor). This is a procedure in which the similarity used \nto join two clusters is calculated as the sum of squares between the two clusters summed over all \nvariables. It is effective in increasing the \u2018within cluster\u2019 homogeneity and prevents chaining.  \n \nFigure 8  Gaussian KS discrimination, Ward\u2019s method \n \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n16\nIn contrast to the robust KS results, clustering of the thirty partial rub signals using established AE \nsignal features such as peak energy, total energy, R.M.S, median, standard deviation, counts and peaks \nwithin an FFT revealed poor separation between brass and steel signals. The most appropriate of such \nfeatures was the signal kurtosis. This energy independent measure of signal spikiness generally yielded \nlarger values for steel rubbing signals than from brass rubbing. However, repeated tests revealed a \nnumber of spurious clustering results. This was attributed to the large spread of kurtosis values obtained \nacross all of the AE signals measured.  \n \nAlthough the KS technique outperformed established signal features dependent upon energy or extreme \nvalues within the amplitude distribution, it is noted that application of autoregressive coefficients as \ninput AE signal features also produced effective discrimination between brass and steel rubbing. This \ntechnique [16] involves modelling each AE signal as an Nth order stochastic process and using the \nsubsequent AR coefficients within the clustering algorithm to represent the signal \u2018fine-scale\u2019 shape to \nwithin a certain accepted prediction error. The optimum order (N) for the AR model is often the lowest \norder at which the minimum mean-squared error becomes stationary and can be determined via the \napplication of the final prediction error (FPE) and Akaike\u2019s information criterion (AIC) [17,18]. \nHowever, it was considered that the success of subsequent AE signal clustering was extremely sensitive \nto the number of AR coefficients employed, as the optimum order varied for different classes of rub \nsignal. In addition to this draw back, it became clear that the AR approach to partial rub classification \nbreaks down when the measured rub signals are modulated by background acoustic noise. \n \n \nTo demonstrate the effect that background noise can have upon rub classification, acoustic noise from \nthe bearings of an operational 500 MW turbine unit was added to the brass and steel rub signals. Figure-\n9 shows hierarchical clustering results achieved from fifteen noisy brass signals and fifteen noisy steel \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n17\nsignals using a 20th order Autoregressive model as the signal descriptors.  This clearly demonstrates that \nthe AR approach becomes inappropriate for brass and steel classification when even low levels of \nbackground noise are present. In contrast, it became clear that KS-based rub classification is less \naffected by the addition of real noise. Figure-10 depicts a typical clustering result using the KS \nalgorithm described earlier. In this case, the same levels of turbine noise was added to the thirty rub \nsignals and the same bandpass filter was applied. As shown, AE signal classification using KS \ndescriptors is more suitable than that based upon the more established AR technique. \n \n \nFigure 9 AR(20) discrimination with low levels of real noise measured from a 500MW turbine \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n18\n \nFigure 10  KS discrimination with low levels of real noise measured from a 500MW turbine. \n \nSecondly, it was proposed that some diagnosis of the \u2018wear state\u2019 of rubbing seals might be inferred \nfrom AE measurement at the bearings. Three mild steel V-groove seals at different stages of wear were \nprepared. These are shown in Fig. 11 and are referred to as unworn, mid-wear and worn. Applying each \nof these fixtures to the partial rub simulator in turn, AE signatures were recorded at the bearings. Figure \n12 shows examples of the signatures obtained for the three wear states at the bearing-1. By inspection, it \nis obvious that the unworn signal appears to be more complex than the other two wear state signals. \nSpecifically, it is clear that two smaller bursts appear in the tail of the unworn AE waveform.  However, \nvisually identifying the difference between the mid-wear and worn state is more difficult, especially as \nthe peak amplitudes of all three are very similar. \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n19\n \n \n \nFigure 11   Unworn, mid-wear and worn steel seal fixtures \n \n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nx 104\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nTime (\/sample Number)\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (\/\nv)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nx 104\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nTime (\/sample Number)\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (\/\nv)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nx 104\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nTime (\/sample Number)\nA\nm\npl\nitu\nde\n (\/\nv)\n \n(a)              (b)       (c) \n \nFigure 12 Example AE signals from a V-Grooved steel seals exhibiting \n(a) No wear (b) Mid-wear (c) Extreme wear \n  \nTo illustrate an automatic classification approach for these wear states, fifteen example signals were \ntaken; five from each of the wear states. Initially, the AR model approach to clustering was applied. \nInspection of the residual error plot, using the Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion, suggested that an AR \norder of 8 was sufficient to represent the signature shape. To test the applicability of the AR approach, a \nplot of the clustering achieved by measuring Euclidean distances between centriod values of AR \ncoefficients associated with each signature is shown in figure14. No pattern in the cluster was observed \n  16mm \n22mm \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n20\nand it was deduced that the AR classification approach is not suitable for determination of the wear state \nof the rubbing seal. \n \nFigure 14  Clustering achieved using 8 AR coefficients for unworn (signals 1-5), mid-wear (signals \n6-10) and very worn (signals 11-15) shaft-seal rubbings. \n \nTo investigate using the KS statistic for distinguishing between the unworn, mid-wear and worn partial \nrubbing states, the same fifteen signals were used. Only the Gaussian distribution was used as the \nreference within the KS algorithm and the cluster result can be seen in figure 15. It is clear from this that \nreasonably good wear classification has been achieved. Primarily, the two major clusters discriminate \nbetween the unworn AE signals and the other two types. This may be justified in that the second and \nthird smaller bursts within the unworn signals cause significant deviation from Gaussian amplitude \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n21\nstatistics. Secondly, the Gaussian KS statistic proved sensitive enough to separate mid-wear and very \nworn rubbing signals within the broader cluster group.  \n \nFig. 15 Clustering achieved using the KS-statistic for unworn (signals 1-5), mid-wear(signals 6-10) and \nvery worn(signals 11-15) shaft-seal rubbings. \n \nFinally, it was of interest to investigate whether the AE technique could distinguish between partial seal \nrubs from different shapes of seal, machined from the same material. This is because the seal and gland \ntip geometry within operational turbines will often differ depending upon the desired radial clearance. \nThe seal shapes considered for this study (figure 16) were all machined from the same grade of mild \nsteel and are known as two-grooved flat labyrinth (2GFL), one-grooved flat labyrinth (1GFL) and the \ntwo-grooved knife-edged (2GKL) seals. Examples of the three classes of signature measured at bearing-\n2 are shown in figure 17. \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n22\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 16: (a) Steel 2GFL seal (b) Steel 1GFL seal (c) Steel 2GKL seal fixtures after experimentation \n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\nx 10\u22123\n\u22120.04\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.01\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\nThe Amplitude\/Time\u2212domain representation of the AE signal\nTime (\/secs)\nA\nm\np\nlit\nu\nd\ne\n (\/\nvo\nlts\n)\n2 4 6 8 10 12\nx 10\u22123\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.01\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\nThe Amplitude\/Time\u2212domain representation of the AE signal\nTime (\/secs)\nA\nm\np\nlit\nu\nd\ne\n (\/\nvo\nlts\n)\n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 0.012 0.014 0.016\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.02\n\u22120.01\n0\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\nThe Amplitude\/Time\u2212domain representation of the AE signal\nTime (\/secs)\nA\nm\np\nlit\nu\nd\ne\n (\/\nvo\nlts\n)\n \n      (a)            (b)            (c) \n \nFigure 17: (a) Steel 2GFL signal (b)  Steel 1GFL signal (c) Steel 2GKL signal \n \n \nAgain, it was found that there were no obvious differences in the amplitude levels of each signature \nclass, as supported by figure-17. Again, this rendered classification based upon absolute values \nimpractical. Moreover, it was found that the AR technique was not sensitive enough to distinguish \nbetween the different shape classes. This is demonstrated by taking five signals from each seal geometry \nclass and effecting the same AR clustering technique. Figure-18 depicts the relatively poor seal shape \n  16mm \n22mm \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n23\nclustering result achieved for an AR(20) model. Similarly, the clustering results observed using kurtosis \nwere not adequate for resolving partial waveforms into separate clusters for different shaped fixtures. \n \nConversely, it was again found that the best classification results were achieved using the KS technique. \nFigure-19 depicts a dendrogram for the five AE signals considered from the three different seal shapes. \nThis indicates that the KS statistic can separate the 2GKL seal from the other two types. However, it was \nconsistently found that distinction between the 2GFL and the 1GFL seal signals was not achieved using \nthe KS statistic. This proved to be the case no matter what combination of reference models (i.e. \ncandidate distribution families as described in the Theory section) were used to evaluate KS values \nwithin the input feature vector.   \n \nThis consistent lack of success in distinguishing between the 2GFL and 1GFL seals of the same material \nmay be justified in terms of the physical rub mechanism. By closer inspection of the two seal types, it is \nobserved that the contact surface areas of the 2GFL and 1GFL seals are exactly the same. Therefore \nduring partial rubbing, an equivalent total flat area of each seal will come into contact with the rotating \nshaft. Hence, it is postulated that for such flat labyrinth shaped seals, a similar total number of asperity \ncontacts occur during the partial rub duration, even though there might be some difference in localised \npressure. Consequently, this results in a statistical similarity between the measured AE waveforms.  \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n24\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.2\n 4  7  5  1  9  3  2  6 10  8 11 14 15 12 13\n \nFigure-18: AR(20) Clustering for Steel 2GFL signals (1-5), Steel 1GFL signals(6-10), Steel 2GKL \nsignals (11-15). \nDistance \nSignals 1-5      = 2GFL \nSignals 6-10    = 1GFL \nSignals 11-15  = 2GKL \nSignal \nNumber \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n25\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\n0.18\n0.2\n12 13 14 11 15  1  3  2  9  5  4  8  6 10  7\n \nFigure 19: Gaussian KS-Clustering for Steel 2GFL signals (1-5), Steel 1GFL signals(6-10) Steel 2GKL \nsignals (11-15). \n \nConclusions \n \nThis paper introduces the use of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic as a useful signal descriptor \nin AE analysis. The KS results presented via hierarchical dendrograms indicate the potential of this \nstatistic in classification of partial rubbing on shafts of fast rotating machinery. Moreover, the success of \nKS classification has been shown when the measured AE rub signals were modulated by background \nnoise from a real operational 500-MW turbine.  \n  \nThe KS technique offers a different and versatile way of probing the shape of the amplitude distribution \nfunction or CDF. It is noted that the KS statistic tends to be more sensitive around the medium value \nDistance \nSignals 1-5      = 2GFL \nSignals 6-10    = 1GFL \nSignals 11-15  = 2GKL \nSignal \nNumber \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n26\n(i.e. where P(x) = 0.5 within the CDF) and less sensitive at the extreme ends of the distribution, where \nP(x) approach either 0 or 1. This is because the KS value does not have a probability distribution \nindependent of amplitude (x). Therefore, whilst the KS statistic is good at finding shifts in the \nprobability distribution, especially changes in medium value, it is not always so good at finding spreads, \nwhich more strongly affect the tails of the probability distribution [12]. Consequently, the KS statistic is \nrobust and not too sensitive to variability in amplitude outliers as is the case with the fourth moment \nkurtosis. Thus it is concluded that the KS statistic provides a suitably stable feature for broadband AE \nsignals that characterises the entire amplitude statistics.  \n \nPhysical interpretation of individual AE signal waveforms from partial rubbing is difficult. However, it \nis suggested that the Gaussian derived KS statistic may be used to relate to the incident physical rub \nmechanisms. Specifically, it is considered that a form of the Central Limit Theorem can be applied. That \nis, a rub induced AE waveform, formed by the addition of a number of temporally close but independent \nasperity contacts, has a probability density function, which approaches the Gaussian distribution, as the \nnumber of contributors or AE sources increases. Consequently, it is postulated that absolute KS values \nfor a Gaussian fit directly quantify the number of concentration of asperity events within the rub event, \nthereby inferring more detailed rub diagnosis such as the rub force or severity. Finally, it is noted that \nthese classification results were achieved using a high-fidelity wideband AE transducer. However, it is \nrealised that the KS technique could break down using low fidelity resonant devices.  \n \n \n \n \nMechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 18 (4), pp. 849-868, 2004 \n \n \n27\nReferences  \n \n1.
