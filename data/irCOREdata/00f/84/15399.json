Although \nprevious research has established that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) \nhave diminished episodic memory, episodic future thinking has not previously been \ninvestigated within this population.  In the present study, high-functioning adults with \nASD were compared to closely matched typical adults on a task requiring participants to \nreport a series of events that happened to them in the past and a series of events that \nmight happen to them in the future.  For each event described, participants completed two \nmodified \u201cMemory Characteristics Questionnaire\u201d (MCQ) items to assess self-reported \nphenomenal qualities associated with remembering and imagining, including self-\nperspective and degree of autonoetic awareness.  Participants also completed letter, \ncategory, and ideational fluency tasks.  Results indicated that participants with ASD \nrecalled\/imagined significantly fewer specific events than comparison participants, \ndemonstrating impaired episodic memory and episodic future thinking.  In line with this \nfinding, participants with ASD were less likely than comparison participants to report\ntaking a \u201cfield\u201d (first-person) perspective, and more likely to report taking an \u201cobserver\u201d \n(third-person) perspective, during retrieval of past events (but not during simulation of \nfuture events), highlighting that they were less likely to mentally re-experience past \nevents from their own point of view.  There were no group differences in self-reported \nlevels of autonoetic awareness or fluency task performance.  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 3\nKeywords\nAutism spectrum disorder; autonoetic consciousness; episodic future thinking; episodic \nmemory; imagination; prospection\n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 4\nIntroduction\nIt is widely accepted that there are various \u201ctypes\u201d of memory (Gardiner, 2008).  \nAccording to the influential \u201csystems\u201d theory, memory is underpinned by multiple \nseparate, but interacting, neuro-cognitive systems, each with unique functions and \nproperties (Schacter & Tulving, 1994).  The \u201csemantic\u201d and \u201cepisodic\u201d systems are two \nsuch hypothetical memory systems.  Broadly defined, semantic memory refers to \nmemory for de-contextualised factual information (e.g., knowledge of the boiling point of \nwater), and episodic memory refers to memory for personally experienced events (e.g., \nremembering boiling a kettle of water to make tea this morning).  For a number of years, \nit has been argued that the ability to remember one\u2019s past experiences is closely related to \nthe ability to imagine one\u2019s possible future experiences (e.g., Suddendorf & Corballis, \n1997; Wheeler, Stuss, & Tulving, 1997).  This latter ability is generally referred to as \n\u201cepisodic future thinking\u201d (e.g., Atance & O'Neill, 2005) or \u201cprospection\u201d (e.g., Buckner \n& Carroll, 2007).  \u201cAutonoetic consciousness\u201d \u2013 a type of self-consciousness that \ninvolves becoming aware of past, present, or future states of self \u2013 is considered to be one \nof the key hallmarks of both episodic memory and episodic future thinking (Wheeler, \nStuss, & Tulving, 1997).  Becoming autonoetically aware of a past or possible future \nstate of self is said to give rise to a sense of \u201cmental time travel\u201d, whereby one mentally \ntravels backwards or forwards through time in order to mentally re-experience a past \nepisode or pre-experience a possible future episode (Suddendorf & Corballis, 1997).  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 5\nThere is considerable evidence for the proposed overlap between episodic \nmemory and episodic future thinking.  For example, individuals with amnesia, who are \nunable to remember past personal experiences, and individuals with depression or \nschizophrenia, who show attenuated memory for past personal experiences, show a \ncorresponding deficit in imagining future personal experiences (D'Argembeau, Raffard, \n& Van der Linden, 2008; Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002; Tulving, 1985; Williams et \nal., 1996).  Episodic memory and episodic future thinking also appear to emerge at \nsimilar points in typical development \u2013 at around 4 years of age (e.g., Atance, 2008; \nPerner, Kloo, & Gornik, 2007) \u2013 and are highly correlated amongst typical adults \n(D'Argembeau, Raffard, & Van der Linden, 2008) and children (Busby & Suddendorf, \n2005).  Moreover, using a meta-analysis, Spreng, Mar, and Kim (2009) established a set \nof functional neural correlates common to both episodic memory and episodic future \nthinking (within medial-prefrontal, medial-temporal, and parietal regions, as well as the \nlateral prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, and occipital lobe).  \nIn order to construct a coherent event representation during either episodic \nmemory retrieval or episodic future thinking \u2013 a process sometimes referred to as \u201cscene \nconstruction\u201d (Hassabis & Maguire, 2007) \u2013 it is necessary to \u201cbind\u201d various multimodal \nfeatures together (e.g., Schacter & Addis, 2007b).  Although both episodic memory and \nepisodic future thinking are thought to involve this type of constructive process, the \nconstructive processes involved in imagining future events need to be considerably more \nflexible than those involved in remembering past events.  Therefore, episodic future \nthinking is likely to be more cognitively demanding than episodic memory.  It has been \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 6\nsuggested that the simulation of future events involves the selective, recursive sampling \nand recombination of event features stored in episodic memory as well as general \nsemantic knowledge (Corballis, 2003; Suddendorf & Busby, 2005).  This feature of \nepisodic future thinking allows one to entertain unlimited potential future scenarios, each \nwith unique combinations of features.  In this way, the processes involved in episodic \nfuture thinking closely resemble those involved in imaginative processes per se.  Indeed, \nrecent research demonstrates that imagining fictitious or fantastic events (that are not \ntemporally displaced) has similar neural correlates to imagining plausible future events \nand remembering past events (Hassabis, Kumaran, & Maguire, 2007).  \nFrom an evolutionary perspective \u2013 and following the more general logic that \nlearning and memory, of whatever type, are only useful insofar as they inform future \nbehaviour \u2013 it has been argued that episodic future thinking, rather than episodic \nmemory, is the primary evolutionary function of the episodic memory system (Schacter \n& Addis, 2007b; Suddendorf & Corballis, 1997, 2007).  According to this view, the \nability to mentally simulate future events allows individuals to test alternative plans of \naction without the potential risks associated with actually carrying out those (potentially \nflawed) plans of action (Currie, 1995).  Thus, simulation of future events may \nconsiderably improve the chances of forming optimal plans of action to guide adaptive \nfuture behaviour.  Moreover, through allowing an individual to consider multiple possible \ncourses of action, episodic future thinking is thought to facilitate behavioural flexibility \nand self-control (Suddendorf & Corballis, 2007).  For example, the capacity for foresight \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 7\nhelps enable individuals to forego immediate gratification in order to achieve long-term \ngains.  \nThese considerations may be relevant to our understanding of autism spectrum \ndisorder (ASD).  ASD comprises a range of developmental disorders including autistic \ndisorder, Asperger\u2019s disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise \nspecified\/atypical autism.  These disorders are characterized by impairments in social \ninteraction and also impairments in one or both of the domains of communication and \nbehavioural flexibility, as manifested in a restricted and repetitive repertoire of \nbehaviours and interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; World Heath \nOrganisation, 1993).  In addition to these behavioural impairments, individuals with ASD \nalso tend to exhibit uneven cognitive profiles, including peaks and troughs in their \nmemory abilities (Ben Shalom, 2003; Boucher & Mayes, in press; Bowler, Gaigg, & \nLind, in press).  For example, whilst individuals with ASD (at least those without \nadditional intellectual disability) demonstrate intact semantic memory, they show \nsignificant impairments in episodic memory.  They show diminished memory for \npersonally experienced events (e.g., Bruck, London, Landa, & Goodman, 2007; Crane & \nGoddard, 2008), source memory (e.g., Lind & Bowler, 2009a; Russell & Jarrold, 1999), \nand free recall (e.g., Boucher & Warrington, 1976), each of which is considered to index \nepisodic memory (e.g., Wheeler, Stuss, & Tulving, 1997).  Bowler, Gardiner, and Gaigg \n(2007) have also directly shown that individuals with ASD are less likely to experience \nautonoetic awareness, the hallmark of episodic memory, during recognition memory \ntasks (suggesting a greater reliance on semantic memory).  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 8\nIndividuals with ASD also characteristically show significantly diminished \nimaginative skills (Harris & Leevers, 2000; Wing & Gould, 1979).  For example, the fact \nthat children with ASD show impoverished spontaneous pretend play (Jarrold, 2003) may \nbe taken as evidence of diminished imagination.  Thus, given that people with ASD have \nimpaired episodic memory and imagination, and given that amongst typical individuals \nepisodic memory, imagination, and episodic future thinking are thought to rely on \noverlapping processes, it seems reasonable to predict that episodic future thinking will \nalso be impaired in ASD.  \nOne plausible explanation for observed deficits in episodic memory and \nimagination (and predicted deficits in episodic future thinking) in ASD is that each of \nthese difficulties stem from executive difficulties with strategically accessing stored \ninformation (Boucher, 2007).  Difficulties with retrieving information stored within \nepisodic or semantic memory may affect the ability of individuals with ASD to \nreconstruct past events or simulate possible future\/fictitious events.  Such difficulties may \nalso potentially account for generativity deficits in ASD.  The term \u201cgenerativity\u201d is used \nto refer to the capacity to spontaneously generate novel ideas and behaviours (Turner, \n1999).  It is most commonly assessed using tests of \u201cfluency\u201d, which typically involve, \nfor example, asking participants to generate as many ideas for potential uses of objects as \npossible within a set time period.  Although there have been a number of inconsistent \nfindings, some studies have found that individuals with ASD show significantly \ndiminished performance on such tasks (see Hill, 2004).    \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 9\nNo previous study (to our knowledge) has sought to investigate episodic future \nthinking in ASD.  However, the value of conducting such an investigation may be \nconsiderable. As stated above, episodic future thinking is thought to play a key role in \nforming successful plans, and increasing behavioural flexibility and the capacity for self-\nregulation.  If individuals with ASD have problems with mentally simulating plans of \naction, and problems with considering various possible courses of action, through \nepisodic future thinking, they may have to fall back on familiar, over-learned routines to \nguide their behaviour.  In this way, impairments in episodic future thinking may \npotentially contribute to the behavioural inflexibility that characterises ASD.  \nAims and Hypotheses\nThus, the main aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that individuals with \nASD have a diminished capacity for episodic memory and episodic future thinking.  If \nthis hypothesis is correct, individuals with ASD should (a) have difficulty with \nrecalling\/imagining specific events and (b) have a diminished sense of mentally re-\nexperiencing or pre-experiencing events in memory or imagination.\nOne way to evaluate sense of re- or pre-experiencing events is to explore points of \nview in memory and imagination.  According to Gillihan and Farar (2005, p.90),\nmemories of personally experienced events should only be considered episodic if recall is \nexperienced from a first-person, self-perspective \u2013 or \u201cthrough the eyes of the self\u201d.  \nIndeed, Nigro and Neisser (1983) established that it is possible to retrieve personally \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 10\nexperienced events not only from a first-person, \u201cfield\u201d perspective but also from an\n\u201cobserver\u201d perspective, in which one sees oneself in one\u2019s memory from an external \npoint of view.  Thus, if episodic memory and episodic future thinking necessarily involve \na field perspective, individuals with ASD should be less likely to take a field perspective \nin memory or imagination.\nIn order to explore these issues, we adopted a standard method (based on \nD'Argembeau & Van der Linden, 2004), which involved asking participants to \nrecall\/imagine and describe a series of specific personal experiences and to complete \naccompanying questionnaires, designed to assess particular phenomenal qualities (i.e., \nsubjectively perceived characteristics) associated with remembered past and imagined \nfuture experiences \u2013 specifically, the extent to which participants felt they were mentally \nre-experiencing or pre-experiencing the event in question (i.e., degree of autonoetic \nawareness) and whether they took a field or observer perspective whilst recalling or \nimagining.  Given that we were interested in exploring the possibility that impairments in \naccessing stored information might contribute to the predicted episodic memory and \nepisodic future thinking impairments in ASD, additional letter, category, and ideational \nfluency tasks were also implemented.\n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 11\nPredictions\n(1) It was predicted that, relative to comparison participants, participants with ASD \nwould show impairments in both episodic memory and episodic future thinking \u2013 that is, \nrecall and imagine significantly fewer specific events.  \n(2) Given that episodic memory and episodic future thinking are thought to (at least \npartially) rely on the same underlying neurocognitive system, and that previous studies \nhave established significant relationships between these variables amongst typical \nindividuals (e.g., D'Argembeau, Raffard, & Van der Linden, 2008), it was predicted that \nthese variables would be significantly correlated within the comparison group.  However, \nan alternative prediction was set out in relation to the ASD group.  If the neurocognitive \nsystem that typically underlies episodic memory and episodic future thinking is \ncompromised in ASD (as we hypothesise it is), it is possible that individuals within the \nASD group may resort to \u201ccompensatory strategies\u201d to perform the task.  In other words, \nfor individuals with ASD, performance on the experimental task may not be mediated by \nthe system typically responsible for episodic memory and episodic future thinking.  In \nwhich case, such a strong association between episodic future thinking and episodic \nmemory task performance may not emerge within this group.  \n(3) Furthermore, if individuals with ASD show reduced episodic remembering and\nepisodic future thinking, this may be reflected in their questionnaire responses.  Thus, it \nwas predicted that individuals with ASD would (a) report less of a sense of re-\n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 12\nexperiencing or pre-experiencing recalled or imagined events (i.e., reduced autonoetic \nawareness) and (b) report fewer instances of taking a field perspective in memory and \nimagination.  \n(4) It was also predicted that letter, category, and ideational fluency would each be \nimpaired amongst individuals with ASD.\n(5) Finally, it was predicted that within the ASD group episodic memory and episodic \nfuture thinking scores would be significantly correlated with imagination\/creativity \nscores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule \u2013 Generic (ADOS; Lord et al., \n2000), which is a semi-structured, standardized assessment of social interaction, \ncommunication, play, and imaginative use of materials, used in the diagnosis of ASD.  \nMethod\nParticipants\nEthical approval for the study was obtained from the Senate Research Ethics Committee \nat City University London.  All participants gave their informed, written consent to take \npart and were paid standard university fees for their participation.  Prior to commencing \nthe study, participants completed a brief, semi-structured interview to establish their age, \nwhether they took any prescribed medication or illegal recreational drugs, and whether \nthey had been diagnosed with any neurological or psychiatric illness.  Intellectual ability \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 13\nwas assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \u2013 Third UK Edition (Wechsler, \n1999). Exclusion criteria included (a) having a full-scale IQ of less than 70; (b) being \nyounger than 18 years of age; (c) being older than 60 years of age; (d) use of \npsychotropic medication or illegal recreational drugs; and (e) neurological or psychiatric \nillness (other than ASD).  The sample consisted of 14 (3 female, 11 male) high-\nfunctioning (full scale IQ \u2265 70) adults with ASD and 14 typical adults (3 female, 11 \nmale).  Participants with and without ASD were individually matched on sex, age (to \nwithin 5 years), and verbal IQ (to within 7 points).  Participant characteristics are \npresented in Table 1.\n[Table 1 here]\nThe groups did not significantly differ on age, verbal IQ, performance IQ, or full \nscale IQ and the effect sizes (rs) were all negligible to small, indicating close matching.  \nThe ASD group consisted of adults who had been diagnosed by local health authorities \nand\/or experienced clinicians, and met established criteria for Asperger\u2019s disorder or \nautistic disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; World Heath Organisation, \n1993).  As an additional diagnostic check, participants within the ASD group were also \nassessed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule \u2013 Generic (ADOS; Lord et \nal., 2000) and the Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, \nMartin, & Clubley, 2001).  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 14\nAs stated above, the ADOS is a semi-structured, standardized assessment of \nsocial interaction, communication, play, and imaginative use of materials, used in the \ndiagnosis of ASD.  The AQ is a 50 item questionnaire, suitable for administration with \nadults with intelligence within the average or above average range, which provides a \nquantitative index of self-reported autistic-like traits.  All participants within the ASD \ngroup met the ASD cutoff (7 points) on the Social + Communication Total Score of the \nADOS (M = 10.57; SD = 3.57; range: 7-17).  AQ scores are summarized in Table 1.  \nOnly one participant from the ASD group scored below 26, the recommended cutoff for \ndistinguishing individuals with and without ASD (Woodbury-Smith, Robinson, & Baron-\nCohen, 2005).  This should not be a cause for concern, however, given that the AQ has \nonly 78% discriminant validity.  Indeed, this participant met criteria for ASD on the \nADOS (obtaining a total score of 11).  \nComparison participants were recruited through local newspaper advertisements.  \nAll comparison participants completed the AQ in order to screen for possible \nundiagnosed ASD and all scored below the recommended cutoff of 26 points.  Moreover, \nthe group difference in AQ scores was highly significant, with a large effect size.  \nMaterials and Procedure\nParticipants were individually tested in a sound-attenuated laboratory.  It was initially \nexplained that they would be asked to try to remember some things that happened to them \nin the past and to try to imagine some things that might happen to them in the future.  The \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 15\ntask itself involved two separate, past and future conditions.  The order in which the past \nand future conditions were completed was counterbalanced across participants.  Prior to \ncommencing each condition, participants were provided with detailed written \ninstructions, presented in Arial 11 font on one side of A4 paper.  The instructions \nexplained that they would be asked to try to recall\/imagine (past\/future condition) a series \nof events from different time periods.  It was emphasised that they should try to \nrecall\/imagine personally experienced events with durations of a few minutes to a few \nhours and not more than a day.  Examples of appropriate and inappropriate responses \nwere provided.  It was explained that after each event described, they would be given 1 \nminute to think about the event in detail, and then be asked to complete a questionnaire.  \nAdditionally, the experimenter reiterated these instructions, providing a verbal \nexplanation of the task requirements.  Participants were then asked to complete a practice \ntrial in order to ensure they had properly understood the instructions.  For the past and \nfuture conditions, respectively, the practice trials involved the cues: \u201cTry to remember an \nevent involving a television\u201d and \u201cTry to imagine an event involving a car\u201d.  If the \nparticipant gave an appropriate response, they immediately progressed onto the test \nphase.  Participants who gave inappropriate responses were provided with further \nguidance and opportunities for practice, until they had fully grasped the nature of the \ntask.  \nThe experimental task (including the practice trials) was presented on a laptop \ncomputer and programmed using Eprime.  In the past and future conditions, participants \nwere presented with cues in the following formats, respectively: \u201cTry to remember an \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 16\nevent that happened to you [specified time period]\u201d and \u201cTry to imagine an event that \nmight happen to you [specified time period]\u201d.  In each condition, participants were asked \nto try to remember\/imagine events from (a) today, (b) yesterday\/tomorrow, (c) a week \nago\/in a week, (d) a month ago\/in a month, (e) a year ago\/ in a year, (f) 5 years ago\/in 5 \nyears, and (g) 10 years ago\/in 10 years.  These cues were presented in a random order \nwithout replacement.  Once the participant indicated that they had thought of a specific \nevent, they were asked to provide a verbal description of that event.  Verbal responses \nwere recorded for later scoring.  After providing each event description, the participant \nwas asked to close their eyes for one minute and try to recall\/imagine the event in as \nmuch detail as possible.  \nParticipants were then asked to respond to the following items, which were \nselected from the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ) (Johnson, Foley, \nSuengras, & Raye, 1988) and modified appropriately for the future condition: \n1.  While remembering\/imagining this event, I feel as though I am reliving\/experiencing \nit (1 = not at all, 7 = completely).\n2.  When you remember\/imagine this event, how do you see it? From the following three \noptions, choose the one that corresponds to your memory\/representation.  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 17\n(a) In your memory\/representation, you see the scene in the same way as an external \nobserver would see it.  In other words, you can see yourself in your \nmemory\/representation as well as other aspects of the situation.\n(b) In your memory\/representation, you see the scene from your own point of view \nand not from that of an external observer.  In other words, you see the scene \nthrough your own eyes.\n(c) Neither of these above mentioned perspectives corresponds to your \nmemory\/representation of the event.  If this is the case, how would you describe \nyour memory\/representation?\nLetter fluency was assessed using the \u201cFAS\u201d Controlled Oral Word Association \nTest (Benton, 1968).  This involved asking participants to generate as many words as \npossible (excluding proper nouns and repeated words with different endings \u2013 e.g., \u201cfly\u201d \nand \u201cflying\u201d) in a one minute period beginning with the letters F, A, and S, respectively.  \nCategory fluency was assessed using a task which involved asking participants to \ngenerate as many category members as possible in a one minute period for the categories:\nanimals, countries, and foods, respectively (Turner, 1999).  Participants also completed \nan ideational fluency task based on the procedure used by Turner (1999).  Participants \nwere given 2.5 minutes to generate as many uses as possible for the following objects: \nnewspaper, brick, pencil, mug, and toothpick.  For each object, the experimenter said to\nthe participant: \u201cHow could we use a [object]?  Tell me something useful that we could \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 18\ndo with it?''  In each case, the experimenter provided examples of conventional (e.g., \nnewspaper: you could read it) and unconventional (e.g., newspaper: you could wrap a \npresent with it) uses for each object.  Participant responses for each of the fluency tasks \nwere recorded for later scoring.   \nScoring\nIn order for an event description in the memory\/future thinking task to qualify as \nepisodic, it had to refer to a specific personal experience that (a) occurred or would occur \nat a particular time in a particular place, (b) lasted or would last for a duration of less than \na day, and (c) occurred or would occur on only one occasion (see Conway & Rubin, \n1986).  Error responses included omissions (i.e., the participant was unable to remember \nor imagine anything at all) and general memories\/images.  General memories\/images \nincluded \u201cextended\u201d memories\/images that referred to events occurring over extended \ntime periods of longer than a day (e.g., \u201cI can imagine next summer my family will be \naway on holiday and I will be home alone\u201d) and \u201ccategoric\u201d memories\/images that \nreferred to repeated events (e.g., \u201cI remember when I used to go on bike rides in the \ncountry\u201d) (Williams & Dritschel, 1992).  \u201cEpisodic memory scores\u201d and \u201cepisodic future \nthinking scores\u201d were established by calculating the proportion of specific\nmemories\/images described within the past and future conditions, respectively.  Thus, the \nmaximum score in each case was 1.00.\n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 19\nItem 1 on the questionnaire, which assessed degree of re-\/pre-experiencing the \nevent, was rated by participants on a scale of 1 to 7.  Past and future \u201cautonoetic \nawareness\u201d scores were established by taking each participant\u2019s average rating on the\nitem across the seven events in each condition, respectively.  Item 2 on the questionnaire, \nwhich assessed point of view, was rated categorically, with responses falling into three \npossible categories: \u201cfield\u201d, \u201cobserver\u201d, and \u201cneither\u201d.  The proportions of responses \nfalling into each of these categories in each of the conditions were calculated.    \nLetter, category, and ideational fluency scores were established by averaging the \nnumber of different (a) words generated across the three letter prompts, (b) category \nmembers generated across the three category prompts, and (c) ideas for uses of objects \ngenerated across the five object prompts, respectively (credit was not given for \nrepetitions or rule breaks).   \nReliability \nThe responses of the participants on the episodic memory\/future thinking task were \nscored by the experimenter (SL) as well as a second, independent rater, who was blind to \nthe diagnoses of the participants and the predictions of the study.  An interrater reliability \nanalysis using the Kappa statistic was performed to determine consistency between the \nraters.  Interrater reliability was found to be Kappa = .67, p < .001.  This value represents \n\u201csubstantial agreement\u201d (Landis & Koch, 1977).  It was established that the majority of \ndisagreements were due to the fact that one rater classified event descriptions that \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 20\nincluded both categoric (general) and specific elements (e.g., I collect money for \nChildren in Need every year.  Last year I did a sponsored walk for Children in Need\u2026..) \nas categoric and the other rater classified them as specific.  Through discussion it was \nagreed that specific instances (with unique features) of repeated events should be classed \nas specific. \nResults\nGroup Differences in Episodic Memory and Episodic Future Thinking Scores \nThe mean episodic memory and episodic future thinking scores (proportions of specific \nevents recalled\/imagined) for the ASD and comparison groups are displayed in Figure 1.  \n[Figure 1 here]\nA 2 (Group: ASD\/comparison) x 2 (Condition: past\/future) mixed ANOVA revealed \nsignificant main effects of Group, F(1,26) = 5.54, p = .03, r =.42 (moderate effect size), \nand Condition, F(1,26) = 6.01, p = .02, r = .43 (moderate effect size), but no significant \ninteraction effect between Group and Condition, F(1,26) = 0.06, p = .81, r = .05 \n(negligible effect size).  This reflects the fact that participants with ASD performed less \nwell than comparison participants in each condition (i.e., obtained significantly lower \nepisodic memory and episodic future thinking scores), and participants within both \ngroups performed significantly less well in the future condition than in the past condition \n(i.e., obtained significantly lower episodic future thinking scores than episodic memory \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 21\nscores).    The proportions of extended, categoric, and omission error responses for each \nof the groups in the past and future conditions are displayed in Table 2.  \n[Table 2 here]\nRelationship Between Episodic Memory and Episodic Future Thinking Scores\nIn order to investigate the relationship between episodic memory and episodic future \nthinking within each of the groups, Pearson\u2019s correlation analyses were conducted.  It \nwas found that episodic memory scores and episodic future thinking scores were \nsignificantly (strongly and positively) correlated within the comparison group, r = .72, p \n< .01, but not within the ASD group, r = -.25, p = .38.  In order to determine whether \nthese relationships were significantly different in terms of strength of association, \nFisher\u2019s Z transformations were computed.  This procedure indicated that the correlation \nwas significantly stronger within the comparison group than within the ASD group, Zr1-r2\n= 2.78, p < .01.  \nMemory Characteristics Questionnaire Responses\nAutonoetic awareness ratings.\nThe mean autonoetic awareness ratings from Item 1 of the MCQ for each of the groups in \neach of the conditions are displayed in Table 3.\n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 22\n[Table 3 here]\nA 2 (Group: ASD\/comparison) x 2 (Condition: past\/future) mixed ANOVA revealed no \nsignificant main effect of Group, F(1,26) < 0.01, p = .94, r =.02 (negligible effect size), a \nmarginally significant main effect of Condition, F(1,26) = 3.81, p = .06, r = .36\n(moderate effect size), and no significant interaction effect between Group and \nCondition, F(1,26) = 0.14, p = .72, r = .07 (negligible effect size).  \nSelf-perspective ratings. \nThe mean proportions of \u201cfield\u201d, \u201cobserver\u201d, and \u201cneither\u201d perspective responses from\nItem 2 of the MCQ for each of the groups in each of the conditions are displayed in \nFigure 2.  \n[Figure 2 here]\nA 2 (Group: ASD\/comparison) x 2 (Condition: past\/future) x 3 (Perspective: \nfield\/observer\/neither) mixed ANOVA revealed no significant main effect of Group, \nF(1,26) < 0.01, p > .99, r < .01 (negligible effect size), no significant main effect of \nCondition, F(1,26) = 0.96, p = .34, r = .19 (small effect size), but a significant main effect \nof Perspective,  F(2,26) = 40.72, p < .001, r = .78 (large effect size).  None of the two \nway interactions was significant, all Fs < 0.51, all ps > .61.  However, the three-way \ninteraction between Group, Condition, and Perspective was significant, F(2,26) = 4.22, p\n= .02, r = .37 (moderate effect size).  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 23\nExploratory follow-up analyses revealed that this interaction arose because of a \ndifference amongst participants with ASD and comparison participants in the relative \nlikelihood of reporting a field rather than observer perspective in the past condition \nversus the future condition.  Table 4 displays these results numerically.   \n[Table 4 here]\nHence, in the future condition, the ratio of field to observer perspectives reported was \nvery similar in the ASD and comparison groups.  In this respect, the reports made by \nparticipants from each group were alike.  In the past condition, patterns of reporting were \nsomewhat different in each group.  Whereas comparison participants were 8 times more \nlikely to report taking a field perspective than an observer perspective, participants with \nASD were only 2.4 times more likely to report taking such a perspective.\nGroup Differences in Fluency Scores\nThe mean letter, category, and ideational fluency scores for each of the groups1 are \ndisplayed in Table 5.  \n[Table 5 here]\nIndependent t-tests were used to assess group differences in performance on the fluency \ntasks (see Table 5).  No significant group differences were observed on any of the fluency \ntasks and the effect sizes were all negligible to small.    \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 24\nRelationship Between Imagination Scores on the ADOS and Episodic Memory\/Future \nThinking Scores  \nIn order to investigate the relationship between ADOS imagination scores and episodic \nmemory and episodic future thinking scores, respectively, correlation analyses were \nconducted within the ASD group only (given that only participants within the ASD group \nhad ADOS scores).  Spearman\u2019s rather than Pearson\u2019s coefficients were used, given that \nthe ADOS imagination scores were restricted to a three-point scale and did not meet the \nassumptions for Pearson\u2019s analyses. It was found that ADOS imagination scores were \nsignificantly correlated with episodic future thinking scores, rs=-.58, p = .03, but not \nepisodic memory scores, rs = .04, p = .90.  It should be noted that on the ADOS, the \nlower the imagination score, the greater the degree of imaginative behaviour \ndemonstrated \u2013 hence the negative correlation.  Thus, the significant negative correlation \nindicates that better imagination was associated with better episodic future thinking\nscores.  \nDiscussion\nIn line with predictions, participants with ASD recalled\/imagined significantly fewer \nspecific events than comparison participants, reflecting impaired episodic memory and \nepisodic future thinking.  Although there were significant between-group differences in \nlevels of performance, patterns of performance were comparable across both groups.  \nParticipants within each group showed significantly better episodic memory than episodic \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 25\nfuture thinking.  This performance pattern is likely to reflect the fact that episodic future \nthinking is more cognitively demanding than episodic memory.  Whereas episodic \nmemory involves reconstructing an event from a pre-specified set of features, based on an \nactual past experience, episodic future thinking is essentially an imaginative process that \ninvolves the selective, recursive sampling and recombination of features from memory, \nin addition to other shared cognitive resources (Corballis, 2003).  \nAlso in line with predictions, it was found that episodic memory and episodic \nfuture thinking were significantly correlated only within the comparison group.  Indeed, \nthe significant (strong and positive) correlation within the comparison group was found to \ndiffer significantly from the non-significant (weak and negative) correlation within the \nASD group.  The results from the comparison group replicate previous research (e.g., \nD'Argembeau, Raffard, & Van der Linden, 2008) and support the notion that episodic \nmemory and episodic future thinking rely on overlapping processes.  The lack of a \nsignificant relationship within the ASD group may reflect the fact that individuals with \nASD are less likely to draw on elements from episodic memory in order to imagine \npossible future experiences, as typical individuals do.  Rather, in trying to envisage future \nevents, individuals with ASD may draw more heavily on elements from semantic \nmemory.  \nOne possible consequence of the observed impairments in episodic memory and \nepisodic future thinking in ASD may be diminished temporally extended self-awareness.  \nTemporally extended self-awareness refers to awareness of one\u2019s continuing existence \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 26\nthrough time (Neisser, 1988; Povinelli, 2001).  As Lind (in press) has argued, \nimpairments in episodic memory and episodic future thinking imply that individuals with \nASD have difficulties with re-experiencing past states of self and pre-experiencing future \nstates of self.  The ability to become aware of past or possible future states of self is \nessential to grasping the self\u2019s continuity through time.  Therefore, this grasp may be \nweaker amongst individuals with ASD (see Lind & Bowler, 2009b).\nIn terms of the subjective measures of episodic memory and episodic future \nthinking, derived from the MCQ, it was found that, contrary to predictions, participants \nwith ASD did not report diminished levels of autonoetic awareness during the task.  It \nmust be acknowledged that this null finding may potentially be attributable to low \nstatistical power (given the relatively small sample size).  However, it should also be \nnoted that the effect size for the group difference in ratings was negligible, suggesting \nthat the effect would be unlikely to reach statistical significance even with much larger \ngroups.  Therefore, the findings superficially seem to suggest that individuals with ASD \nshow intact autonoetic awareness.  \nPartially in line with predictions, group differences in self-perspective emerged in \nrelation to episodic memory but not episodic future thinking.  It was found that \nparticipants with ASD were less likely than comparison participants to take a field (self) \nperspective and more likely to take an observer perspective during the recall of past \nevents.  This suggests that the phenomenal placement of self during event memory may \nbe somewhat atypical in ASD \u2013 individuals with the disorder seem to show a reduced \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 27\npropensity for re-experiencing events \u201cthrough the eyes of the self\u201d.  According to \nGillihan and Farar (2005), a field perspective is a key hallmark of episodic memory.  \nThus, these findings are in keeping with the notion of diminished episodic memory in \nASD.  \nIt is important to note, at this point, that self-report measures should always be \ninterpreted with caution amongst individuals with ASD.  It is widely thought that \nindividuals with ASD have limited introspective abilities (Hurlburt, Happ\u00e9, & Frith, \n1994; Williams, in press).  For example, it is found that individuals with ASD tend to \nunder-report the severity of their autistic features (Johnson, Filliter, & Murphy, 2009) and \nshow diminished awareness of their mental states (Williams & Happ\u00e9, 2009, 2010).  If \nindividuals with ASD have diminished introspective abilities, this may mean that their\nMCQ responses do not accurately reflect their actual inner experiences during \nremembering the past and imagining the future.  This may help to explain some of the \napparently contradictory findings, not only between the (arguably more valid) objective \nmeasures and the subjective measures, but also between the two subjective measures (the \nself-reported degree of autonoetic awareness and visual perspective items).  For example, \nin the past condition, individuals with ASD reported typical levels of autonoetic \nawareness but fewer instances of field perspectives \u2013 findings which seem incompatible.  \nHow can one have a sense of reliving or experiencing an event without seeing it from \none\u2019s own point of view?  This provides some evidence for the suggestion that the \nsubjective reports may not be reliable or valid amongst the ASD group.  In some \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 28\ninstances, individuals with ASD may think they are mentally re-experiencing or pre-\nexperiencing events when in fact they are not fully doing so.  \nIt was found that participants with and without ASD showed similar levels of \nperformance on each of the fluency tasks, with no significant group differences observed.  \nAlthough the groups performed almost identically on the category fluency task (effect \nsize r < .01), it is possible that group differences on the letter and ideational fluency tasks \nmay have reached statistical significance with a larger sample.  Interestingly, although the \nASD group showed a trend towards inferior performance on the ideational fluency task\n(consistent with predictions), they showed a trend towards superior performance on the\nletter fluency task (inconsistent with predictions).  Although some previous studies \ninvolving children with ASD have observed performance deficits on fluency tasks (e.g., \nTurner, 1999), consistent with the current findings, recent research involving high-\nfunctioning adults has found no such impairments (e.g., Crane & Goddard, 2008). The \ncurrent findings seem to suggest that by and large the participants with ASD did not have \ndifficulties with strategically accessing stored information.  Therefore, it can be\ntentatively concluded that episodic memory and episodic future thinking impairments in \nASD are unlikely to stem from difficulties with accessing stored information.  \nOne alternative explanation is that difficulties in episodic memory and episodic \nfuture thinking stem from an impaired ability to utilise the \u201cepisodic buffer\u201d component \nof working memory (Boucher, 2007).  The episodic buffer is one possible mechanism by \nwhich the type of featural binding that is required for episodic memory and episodic \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 29\nfuture thinking may be accomplished.  According to Baddeley\u2019s (2000) working memory \nmodel, the episodic buffer is \u201ca limited capacity system that provides temporary storage \nof information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from \nthe subsidiary systems [i.e., the visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop], and from \nlong-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation\u201d (Baddeley, 2000, p.417).  \nHence, the episodic buffer may provide the mental space in which to reconstruct past \nevents or simulate future events (Schacter & Addis, 2007a).  \nGiven that the episodic buffer is thought to be responsible for binding together \ninformation during episodic memory retrieval, this view is consistent with the fact that \nindividuals with ASD have little difficulty with remembering individual items but have \nsignificant difficulty remembering combinations of items2 (Bowler, Gaigg, & Gardiner, \n2008).  Impairments in the episodic buffer mechanism may also potentially explain the \nimaginative deficits in ASD.  Boucher hypothesizes that imagination in ASD may be \nlargely \u201climited to rerunning images on the visuospatial scratchpad or rerunning \nsequences of words in the phonological loop\u201d (p.262).  This may mean that individuals \nwith ASD have difficulty with simulating dynamic sequences of \u201cnon-actual\u201d events \u2013\nand this would equally impact upon episodic future thinking.  Therefore, hypothesised \nimpairments in the episodic buffer may potentially explain why individuals with ASD \nhave co-occurring impairments in episodic memory, episodic future thinking, and \nimagination.  However, further research will be required to establish the validity of this \ntheory.  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 30\nPartially in line with predictions, it was found that imagination scores on the \nADOS were significantly correlated with episodic future thinking scores but not episodic \nmemory scores.  These findings suggest that the co-variance is attributable to the fact that \nboth episodic future thinking and imagination require the selective recursive sampling \nand recombination of elements from episodic and semantic memory, whilst episodic \nmemory does not.  \nLimitations\nThe present study had two main limitations, which must be taken into account when \ninterpreting the findings.  Firstly, the small sample size employed means that conclusions \nshould only be drawn tentatively and, in particular, any null findings should be \ninterpreted with caution.  Given these concerns, it may be advisable to focus on the \nestablished effect sizes rather than p-values.    \nA second limitation of the study concerns the possible confounding effects of co-\nmorbid psychiatric conditions.  Although the presence of psychiatric diagnoses other than \nASD was an exclusionary criterion of the study, we cannot be certain that participants did \nnot have previously undiagnosed, co-morbid psychiatric conditions (given that we did not \nassess these as part of the study).   If a participant had undiagnosed, co-morbid \ndepression, for example, this may have affected their performance on the experimental \ntasks.\n  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 31\nConclusions\nThe present findings should be taken as confirmation of impaired episodic memory in \nASD and as preliminary evidence for impaired episodic future thinking.  However, given \nthe limitations of the study, it will be important to replicate these finding before drawing \nabsolute conclusions.  Possibly the most parsimonious explanation for the finding that \nboth episodic memory and episodic future thinking appear to be impaired in ASD is that \neach of these abilities rely on the same underlying neurocognitive system \u2013 as many other \nresearchers have suggested is the case \u2013 and this system is dysfunctional in ASD. What \nremains unclear is whether the system as a whole is compromised or whether one or more \nspecific components of the system are compromised.  \n                                       Episodic memory and episodic future thinking in autism 32\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association (2000).
