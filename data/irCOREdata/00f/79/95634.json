[158 words]  \n \n \nKey words: Fear of crime; public health; vulnerability; longitudinal research \n \n 2\nINTRODUCTION \nThe fear of crime remains a topical social and political issue that attracts a wealth of research from \na variety of social scientific disciplines. Much of the attention is predicated on the status of the \nfear of crime as a significant social problem.1 Research shows that a relatively large minority of \ncitizens of countries across the world worry about becoming a victim of crime. Resulting anxieties \nare believed to erode quality of life and well-being, restrict movement, motivate costly \nprecautions, encourage \u2018flight\u2019 from deprived areas, and harm social trust, inter-group relations \nand the capacity of communities to exercise social control (Hale, 1996). \nBecause of the assumed impact, and because of disconnect between \u2018fear\u2019 and \u2018crime,\u2019 \nfear of crime is often seen as a social problem in its own right. Some argue that public emotions \nabout crime are fed by the sensationalism of mass media coverage of crime (Warr, 2000). Others \ncontend that public attitudes towards crime are rooted in day-to-day concerns about social \ncohesion and neighbourhood breakdown, leaving fear less an irrational sense of crime and more a \ncompound of broader issues of quality-of-life and social stability (Jackson, 2004, 2006; Farrall et \nal., 2009). Still others argue that public policy, mass media coverage and criminological research \nhave each contributed to a culture of fear that encourages people to view the world through the \nlens of crime, security and safety, driving ever-more punitive policy from Government (Lee, 2007, \n2001, 1999; Simon, 2007; Zedner, 2003; Furedi, 2006; Bauman, 2002). \nStudying the impact of fear of crime on individual and community health is an important \nendeavour however. By focusing on the consequences of fear we can begin to weigh up the overall \nimpact of public insecurities about crime on society. We can thereby do some basic work on the \nimpact of this social phenomenon on personal well-being. Consider Dolan & Peasgood\u2019s (2007) \nestimation of the \u2018cost\u2019 of fear on public health. First, they capitalised on new measures of \nepisodes of worry about crime (Farrall & Gadd, 2004; Gray et al., 2008a; Farrall et al., 2009). \nSecond, they assumed an association between the intensity of \u2018fearful incidents\u2019 and the impact on \n\u2018health-related quality of life.\u2019 For example, when a survey respondent says that they are \u2018very \nworried\u2019 in one particular episode, this was assumed to last a certain amount of time with a typical \nimpact on anxiety\/depression. Third, they linked the number and intensity of episodes of worry \nabout crime (and the assumed impact on anxiety\/depression) to the \u2018quality-adjusted life year \n(QALY) instrument.2 The resulting calculation allowed them to estimate the direct impact of fear \nepisodes on health loss, and conclude with a monetary value given to fear of crime in England and \nWales.3  \nYet given the common belief that fear of crime is an unqualified social ill, there is \nsurprisingly little robust data on its impact. In particular, a striking gap in the evidence base \nregards the effect of fear of crime on health and quality of life. While respondents of the British \nCrime Survey regularly report that fear of crime reduces their quality of life, such self-reports can \nonly ever be indicative. While other work has found correlations between worry about crime and \nself-reported physical and psychological health from single-shot surveys (Kruger et al., 2007; \nChandola, 2001; Ross, 1993; see also Adams & Serpe, 2000), such self-reports are no substitute \nfor longitudinal studies that utilise objective and self-reported measures of physical and \npsychological health. Thus viewed, Hale\u2019s (1996) assertion that fear erodes psychological well-\nbeing remains suggestive rather than settled.  \nOne exception is a recent longitudinal, prospective cohort study that found a robust effect \nof worry about crime on reduced health (Stafford et al., 2007). The Whitehall II study tracks \n10,308 women and men all of whom were employed in the London offices of the British Civil \nService on recruitment to the study in 1985. Examining the impact of worry about crime on \n                                                 \n1 Criminological on the fear of crime has been motivated not only by its social problem status, of course. For example \nreaders of this journal will also be all-too-familiar with the plea that we need better conceptual and methodological tools \nto more fully appreciate the complex and contested nature of public thoughts and feelings about crime (Taylor, 1995; \nFarrall et al., 1997; Hollway & Jefferson, 1997; Loader et al., 1998; Gabriel & Greve, 2003; Farrall & Gadd, 2004; \nJackson, 2004; Sutton & Farrall, 2005). \n2 For a discussion of this instrument, see Gold et al. (2002). \n3 They also note however that: \u2018\u2026if the fear of crime is a pervasive emotional response to a chronic state, then focusing \non specific occurrences of immediate feelings of fear will mean that these figures understate the direct health impact of \nfear of crime\u2019 (Dolan & Peasgood, 2007: 128). \n 3\nphysical and psychological health, Stafford et al. (2007) found that fear of crime at baseline was \nprospectively associated with poorer mental health, with reduced physical functioning on \nobjective and subjective indicators, and with a lower quality of life. Participants reporting greater \nworry were just over 1.5 times as likely to have a common mental disorder, and just under 2 times \nas likely to have depression, compared to those reporting low fear of crime. They exercised less, \nsaw friends less often, they participated in fewer social activities. To some extent the curbing of \nphysical and social activities (cf. Liska et al., 1988; Foster & Giles-Corti, 2008; Taylor et al., \n2009) helped explain the link between worry about crime and health.4 Worry about crime thus \nseems not just an affective response and a generalised anxiety, but also something that is \nassociated with impaired physical and mental health functioning.  \nThis paper builds upon the longitudinal investigation of public health and worry about \ncrime. As Dolan & Peasgood (2007: 125-126) argue: \n \n\u2018The relationship between anticipating crime and health is complex, not least because \nthe direction of causality is not clear. Those suffering from poor mental health may \nbe more fearful of crime because they are more fearful generally. And those with \npoor physical health, particularly limited mobility, hearing and eyesight problems, \nmay feel more unsafe and vulnerable both in the home and outside it, especially at \nnight. Consequently, it is necessary to interpret evidence of an association between \nfear of crime and health with caution.\u2019 \n \nAs just outlined, there is existing evidence that worry about crime may reduce health. But might \npoor health in turn increase worry about crime? In order to test a feedback model of fear of crime \nand public health, this paper calls on further data from the Whitehall II study to assess whether \nhealth has a feedback effect back onto worry about crime. Demonstration of an impact of health \non worry about crime \u2013 in combination with previous evidence indicating that fear of crime is \ndetrimental to health \u2013 suggests a recursive model of fear and health. Poor mental and physical \nhealth may elevate public anxieties about crime, but anxieties about crime may in turn only serve \nto harm health further. By way of contribution, the paper also suggests a few pathways by which \nhealth and anticipating crime might inter-relate.  \n \nThe effect of health on fear of crime \nAnalyses of British Crime Survey data (e.g. Allen, 2004: 44-45) have repeatedly found that self-\nreported health is associated with worry about crime net of victimization experience, \ndemographics (e.g. gender, age, ethnicity, social class, tenure, household composition, and \nincome) and area-level variables (e.g. deprivation and crime levels). Self-rated health has also \nbeen found to be a statistically significant correlate when \u2018fear of crime\u2019 is disaggregated into \nanxiety about crime (where people say they are worried but cannot actually recall a recent moment \nwhen they felt under threat) and concrete moments of everyday worry (Farrall et al., 2009).  \nWhy might there be a relationship between health (whether it is physical or mental health) \nand fear of crime? Figure 1 outlines three possible pathways from health to anticipated crime.  \n \nINSERT FIGURE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nThe first pathway states that those with poor health will feel more vulnerable (or \nsusceptible) to the possibility and impact of crime (Killias, 1990). An individual or social group \nmight be said to be vulnerable when they see themselves to be especially susceptible to \nvictimization and when this leads them to express especially frequent everyday worry (Jackson, \n2009). In the current context the increased vulnerability of those with poor health is expected to \n                                                 \n4 In the observational study of Stafford et al. (2007) it would be unreasonable to claim that a causal relationship between \nfear of crime and mental health and physical functioning has been demonstrated. However, adjustment for previous \nmental health and health functioning was made and so it was reasonable to conclude that the experience of poor health \nleading to increased fear was not the only driver of the associations seen. Furthermore, objective measures of physical \nfunctioning, captured by walking speed and lung function, as well as subjective measures of health, were associated \nwith fear of crime. \n 4\nlead to more intense and more frequent worries about victimization. Those with poor health will \nthink that they are more likely to be targeted by criminals (perhaps because they are seen as \u2018easy \nvictims\u2019), less likely to be able to control the event (perhaps because they are unable to physically \ndefend themselves), and more likely to view the consequences of victimisation to be especially \nserious (someone in already poor health may suffer an especially serious impact).  \nThe second pathway is through decreased trust and community participation. There is a \ngood deal of evidence that public concerns about neighbourhood disorder, social cohesion and \ncollective efficacy are associated with perceptions of risk and subsequent worry or anxiety \n(Ferraro, 1995; Perkins & Taylor, 1996; Jackson, 2004; Wyant, 2008). Such work suggests that a \nsense of security and the risk of crime emerges out of broader public assessments of social \nstability, moral consensus and the collective informal control processes that underpin \nneighbourhood order (Bannister, 1993; Girling et al, 2000; Jackson, 2006). There is also some \nevidence that common mental disorders lead to social withdrawal and reduced social functioning \n(Paykel et al., 1971; Wells et al., 1989; Johnson et al., 1992; Sherbourne et al., 1994; Hays et al., \n1995; Coulehan et al., 1997). These could in turn reduce social trust and increase concerns about \nneighbourhood disorder and cohesion. The question of whether poor physical health is related to \ndisconnection from community remains however, although it is plausible that physical limitations \ncan reduce a person\u2019s ability to participate in certain social and community activities, and ill-\nhealth and disability may limit social participation in several ways (Locker, 1983; Cardol et al., \n2002). Recent evidence on the impact of illness on social activities is mixed, being significant for \nwomen but not men (Platt, 2006). Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the impact of \nchronic physical illness on community participation and trust. \n The third and final pathway from health to fear is through general fear, worry or anxiety. \nA recent study found a small but not insignificant statistical effect of general state and trait anxiety \n(using the Spielberger, 1983, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) on fear (Chadee et al., 2008). This is \nconsistent with Calvo & Eysenck\u2019s (2000) finding that trait anxiety heightened vigilance for \ndanger processing (see also Beck & Clarke, 1997). Focusing on worry, Hough (1995) found that \npeople who worried about crime also tended to worry about other life events and problems (cf. \nDammert & Malone, 2003). An alternative way of looking at this is that people may displace their \nfears of other things onto their fear of \u2018crime\u2019 (Hollway & Jefferson, 1997), and as mentioned \nabove, anxieties about social cohesion and moral consensus may get channeled through concerns \nabout deviance, crime and policing. However, the link between health and generalized fear, worry \nand anxiety certainly requires careful attention. Common mental disorders (especially anxiety \ndisorders) clearly have considerable overlap with the mediating pathway and whether they can be \ndefined as separate concepts is questionable; indeed there may not be separate concepts of \ngeneralized fear and anxiety. \n \nGoals of the study \nAs just outlined, there is empirical evidence to support each of the individual steps in our \ntheoretical model summarized in Figure 1. Yet empirical analysis of this model in its entirety has \nnot been attempted. Moreover, the effect of poor health on fear of crime has only been \ninvestigated using cross-sectional data and non-specific measures of health. The contribution of \nthis paper is to examine the basic association between worry about crime and mental health and \nphysical functioning health indicators. We marshal longitudinal data to examine the prospective \nassociation between health at baseline and subsequent worry about crime. We examine only the \nrelationship between health and fear, but we finish the paper with some suggestions for future \nresearch on the mediating pathways. \n \nMethod \nThe Whitehall II study \nData come from the first seven phases of the Whitehall II study. This is a longitudinal study of \n10,308 London-based civil servants aged 35-55 years at baseline. The focus in this paper is on \ndata from the fifth and seventh phases.  At phase 5 (1997-1999) 7,830 participants completed a \nquestionnaire covering socio-demographic characteristics and health status. At phase 7 (2002-\n2004) a further questionnaire and screening was completed which included the same health \n 5\nmeasures as well as a measure of fear of crime. Additionally, data from phases 1, 2 and 3 were \nused to assess depressive symptoms and long-term depression status. Approval for the study was \ngranted by the University College London ethics committee and all participants consented to the \nstudy. \n \nFear of crime \nFear of crime can be divided as a range of feelings, thoughts and behaviours, all directed towards \nthe personal risk of criminal victimisation. In this paper we focus on feelings towards the risk of \nvictimisation, and worry in particular. Participants were asked how worried they are about the \nfollowing events in their neighbourhood: home being broken into; being mugged or robbed; car \nbeing stolen or things being stolen from the car; and being raped.  Possible responses to each item \nwere very worried (score 3)\/ fairly worried (2)\/ not very worried (1)\/ not worried at all (0) and \nthese were summed to create a fear of crime scale ranging from 0 to 12 (Cronbach\u2019s alpha 0.77). \nWe acknowledge that answers to these questions may most often represent anxiety about \nvictimisation rather than concrete emotional events (Hough, 1995, 2004; Farrall et al., 2009). We \nreturn, in the closing of this paper, to issues in the measurement of the fear of crime.  \n \nHealth measures  \nThe depression subscale (Griffin et al., 2002) of the 30-item General Health Questionnaire \n(Goldberg & Williams, 1985) captured total number of depressive symptoms (Cronbach\u2019s alpha \n0.86). Depression items were as follows: \u2018\u2018Have you recently: 1) been thinking of yourself as a \nworthless person; 2) felt that life is entirely hopeless; 3) felt that life isn\u2019t worth living; 4) found at \ntimes you couldn\u2019t do anything because your nerves were too bad?\u2019\u2019 Possible responses were \u2018\u2018not \nat all\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018no more than usual\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018rather more than usual\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018much more than usual\u2019\u2019 (scored \nfrom 0 to 3 respectively). A cut-off score of 4 out of 12 identified possible cases of depression at \neach wave. Data from up to four waves were utilised to capture persistent depression as the \nnumber of occasions the threshold was reached, ranging from 0 (indicating participant did not \nreach threshold for depression on any occasion) to 4.  \nMental and physical health functioning were measured by the SF-36 Mental and Physical \nComponent Summary scores (MCS and PCS respectively). Summary scores are created from the \noriginal 8 scales of the SF-36 (capturing physical functioning, social functioning, role limitations \ndue to physical illness, role limitations due to emotional well-being, vitality, bodily pain, general \nmental health and general health perceptions) by transforming each to a z-score, multiplying the z-\nscores by subscale factor score coefficients and summing over the 8 subscales. The summary \ncomponent scores are then normalised to the US general population and range from 0 to 100  \n(Ware & Kosinski, 2001). Lower scores represent greater functional limitation.  Participants also \nreported whether they had any long-term illness (anything that had troubled them over a period of \ntime or was likely to affect them over a period of time) and responses were treated as a \ndichotomous variable. \nCurrent or most recent civil service employment grade was hierarchically ranked from \nhigh to low and used as an indicator of socioeconomic position. Grade of employment was \ndetermined by asking all participants for their civil service grade title. On the basis of salary the \ncivil service identified 12 non-industrial grades that, in order of decreasing salary, comprise seven \n\u201cunified grades\u201d, senior executive officer, higher executive officer, executive officer, clerical \nofficer, and clerical assistant. Other professional and technical staff were assigned to these grades \non the basis of salary. For analysis, three groups were created by combining: unified grades 1\u20137 \n(highest grades); executive officers (middle grades); clerical officers and assistants (lowest \ngrades). \n \nStatistical methods \nMental and physical component summary scores were split into quintiles (five groups based on \nequal numbers of participants) for presentation. Linear regression was used to predict fear of crime \nat phase 7 as a function of health at phase 5 firstly using separate models for each health measure \nand then including all health measures simultaneously.  The health measures were included as \ncontinuous covariates in the regression models.  For presentation in the tables, mean fear of crime \n 6\nby categories of health status was estimated after adjusting for participant\u2019s age, gender and \nemployment grade using the least square means approach.  These are the means that have been \ncorrected for imbalances in other variables in the model. To reduce the possibility of confounding \nby reporting style, or negative affect, we additionally adjusted for depressive symptoms at phase 7.  \n \nResults \nThe study sample is summarized in Table 1. In unadjusted analysis, fear of crime was found to be \nhigher for women and those in lower employment grades compared with men and those in higher \ngrades. Fear of crime was higher for those who had been depressed at a previous wave and for \nthose who reported having a longstanding illness. \n \nINSERT TABLE ONE ABOUT HERE \n \nTable 2 summarises the adjusted associations between health at Phase 5 and subsequent \nfear of crime. These analyses represent the association between health and fear taking out the \npossible confounding effects of age, gender, socioeconomic status and concurrent depressive \nsymptoms. The adjusted means show a steadily increasing mean fear of crime with increasing \npersistence of depression, decreasing physical health functioning and decreasing mental health \nfunctioning. Having a long-term illness was also associated with reporting greater fear of crime.  \nThese results are confirmed using linear regression analysis to quantify the relationship between \nfear of crime and each health domain.  For each increase in number of occasions depressed, the \nmean fear of crime rose by 0.55.  In other words, participants who were depressed at 1 previous \nwave of the study had a fear of crime score which was 0.55 points higher than those who had not \nbeen depressed at any prior wave.  Participants who were depressed at 2 previous waves had a fear \nof crime score which was 1.10 (calculated as 0.55 x 2) points higher.  Fear of crime increased by \n0.03 points for each 1 unit increase in mental component summary score.  This translates to a \ndifference of 0.54 points (calculated as 0.03 x 9 x 2) for participants who are 1 standard deviation \nbelow the mean level of mental functioning compared with those who are 1 standrad deviation \nabove mean mental functioning (noting that the standard deviation for MCS is 9.0, see Table 1). \n \nINSERT TABLE TWO ABOUT HERE \n \nNext we turn to the question of which specific aspects of health matter most for generating \nfear. Table 3 shows mean levels of fear at each level of health, controlling for the age, gender, \nsocioeconomic status and other health domains of the participant.  The first point to notice is that \nthe linear coefficient for number of occasions depressed is substantially lower in this Table \ncompared with Table 2.  In other words, the association between depression and fear of crime is \nreduced when we take account of participant\u2019s mental and physical health functioning.  This is not \nsurprising as the mental component summary score captures the impact of mental health (or lack \nof mental health) on a person\u2019s daily activities.  Nevertheless, occasions depressed and mental and \nphysical component summary scores contributed independently to subsequent fear of crime \n(illustrated by the statistically significant p-values for these variables).  For example, mean fear of \ncrime was 2.67 for participants with the highest mental component summary scores compared to \n3.41 for those with the lowest scores, adjusting for physical functioning, long-term illness and \npersistent depression as well as for concurrent depressive symptoms. This corresponds to an effect \nsize of 0.37. Participants with the lowest physical component summary scores (i.e. those with the \nmost limited physical functioning) experienced the greatest fear of crime (mean 3.49), closely \nfollowed by those with the lowest mental component summary scores (mean fear of crime 3.41). \nOnly the long-term illness indicator was not independently associated with fear of crime once \ndepression and health functioning were accounted for. In other words, people with long-term \ndepressive symptoms, poorer physical functioning or poorer mental functioning are more likely to \nreport subsequent fear of crime. Poor mental or physical health at time 1 predicts heightened fear \nof crime at time 2. Considering only participants who were not above the threshold for possible \ndepression did not materially alter these results. \n \n 7\nINSERT TABLE THREE ABOUT HERE \n \nDiscussion \nThese results provide support for the hypothesis that poor health leads to increased worry about \ncrime. Because the findings are based on longitudinal analysis of health indicators measured up to \nfive years before indicators of worry, the temporal sequence of poor health preceding worry is \nestablished \u2013 at least amongst our sample of individuals aged 44 and above. The possibility for \nreporting style to bias the results was reduced by statistical adjustment for depressive symptoms \nconcurrent with the worry about crime measure. In addition, both mental and physical health \nappear to contribute independently to greater worry. This supports the idea that physical frailty can \nincrease worry about crime and also highlights heightened worry as one burden of common \nmental disorder. \n \nLimitations \nBefore discussing the findings in more detail, some limitations of the study should be recognised. \nFirst, it would have been preferable to have measures of worry about crime at an earlier phase and \nto link new onset physical or mental ill health to increasing worry. Worry about crime was \nmeasured on only one occasion in the Whitehall II study. We cannot discount the possibility that \nour findings are explained by prior worry about crime leading to both prior health and subsequent \nworry. \nSecond, there may be a wealth of feelings, thoughts and behaviours about crime and the \nanticipation of crime (Gray et al., 2008b). People may change the way they behave as a precaution \nagainst crime and general lack of comfort in an environment. People may judge the risk through \nassessments of the likelihood of victimization, feelings of control over the possibility, and \nperceptions of the potential consequences of victimization (Jackson, 2009; Killias, 1990). People \nmay feel angry, indignant, worried, fearful, even excited about crime or seemingly threatening and \nunpredictable environments. \u2018Crime\u2019 might also expand beyond the obvious (\u2018the victimization \nevent\u2019) to include symbols associated to risk in one\u2019s environment, and the broader social \nconcerns that are involved in evaluating the extent of neighbourhood stability and breakdown \n(Ferraro, 1995; Taylor et al., 1996; Girling et al., 2000; Jackson, 2008a). \nThese complexities have a number of important implications for the measurement of fear \nof crime. As in the Whitehall II study, surveys in the UK (most prominently the British Crime \nSurvey) typically field general measures of worry about crime: \u2018How worried are you about being \nburgled?\u2019 [Very, fairly, not very, not at all]. Yet recent work has shown considerable complexity \nunderlying these general reports. On the one hand, worry about crime might usefully be \nsubdivided into everyday worry (those mental events which can be recalled and counted, which \nresult from feeling threatened or ruminating about future dangers) and a more diffuse social \nattitude and anxiety (Farrall et al., 2009). Among those who live in high crime areas, who have \nhad extensive direct or indirect experience of victimisation \u2013 and who are especially concerned \nabout local neighbourhood breakdown and normative instability \u2013 \u2018fear\u2019 spikes up into those rare \nmoments of everyday worry over one\u2019s personal safety and the security of one\u2019s property. But for \npeople who live in more protected areas \u2013 who have had less experience of crime, who are less \nconcerned about local incivilities and neighbourhood stability \u2013 \u2018fear\u2019 is best displayed as a \ndiffuse anxiety and a background awareness of risk and possibility. \nOn the other hand, another recent study found that around one-quarter of respondents who \nsaid they were worried about crime also (a) took precautions, (b) felt safer as a result of these \nprecautions, where (c) their worry and routine activity did not reduce the quality of their lives \n(Jackson & Gray, 2009). This suggests that a significant proportion of the \u2018fear of crime\u2019 that is \npicked up by general population surveys should be interpreted as \u2018functional fear,\u2019 where some \namount of worry partly motivated healthy precaution. For some people, therefore, fear of crime \nmay represent a natural defence against crime rather than something that is damaging to their life \nand well-being.  \nThe current study only used measures of the intensity of worry about crime. We do not \nknow whether poor health is more strongly linked to everyday worry than anxiety about crime. \nThis differentiation is only achieved by measuring worry about crime using both intensity and \n 8\nfrequency questions. We also cannot differentiate between a worry about crime that is harmful and \na worry about crime that is helpful. In the current context, it may be that poor health would have \nbeen more strongly linked to dysfunctional fear than functional fear. But the Whitehall II study did \nnot field the follow-up probes that allows one to disentangle worry about crime in the ways just \ndescribed. We acknowledge therefore that patterns could change if we were able to decompose \n\u2018fear\u2019 in these ways. This is something for future study. \n The third limitation to our study regards the ways in which feelings of safety and \nperceptions of risk are embedded in how people make sense of their physical and social \nenvironment. There is also evidence that public perceptions of neighbourhood disorder and urban \nalienation (more broadly) have a negative impact on health and well-being (e.g. Ross & \nMirowsky, 2001). This combines with evidence that fear of crime emerges out of public concerns \nabout disorder, social trust and cohesion. Future work might measure these aspects and \ndisentangle them from fear of crime. Studies might thus address the possibly separate effects of \nfear of crime and neighbourhood quality on health and well-being.  \nA final limitation \u2013 but yet another opportunity for future research \u2013 is that the current \nstudy did not address the pathways by which health influences fear. Future work might measure \nthe intervening mechanisms that underpin vulnerability, for example, thus assessing whether poor \nhealth increases the sense that victimization is likely, uncontrollable and highly consequential (cf. \nKillias, 1990; Jackson, in press), with a knock-on impact on heightened worry about crime. It may \nbe heightened perceptions of risk interact to increase \u2018sensitivity to risk\u2019: when individuals \nperceive crime to be especially serious in its personal impact, and when individuals perceive that \nthey have little personal control over the victimization event occurring, a lower level of perceived \nlikelihood is needed to raise the frequency of worry (Warr, 1987; Jackson, 2008b).   \n \nConclusions: Towards a feedback model of health, well-being and the fear of crime \nThe findings of this study build on recent evidence that fear of crime at baseline harms public \nhealth at a later period (Stafford et al., 2007). If fear harms health, and if health in turn heightens \nfear, a feedback model emerges \u2013 and worry about crime is implicated in a cycle of decreased \nhealth, increased vulnerability, and further insecurities about crime.  \nFigure 2 sketches out the potential pathways by which health might influence worry about \ncrime, and in turn how worry about crime might influence health. We have already outlined the \nthree pathways between health and worry. As a final contribution, we now discuss three possible \npathways from worry back to health: \n \n1. directly; \n2. by reducing physical activity, which then decreases mental and physical health; and, \n3. by reducing social ties and trust, which then decreases mental and physical health. \n \nINSERT FIGURE TWO ABOUT HERE \n \n The direct effect is proposed to occur when concrete experiences of anxiety, worry or fear \n(about anticipated crime and feeling personally threatened) induces stress that has a measurable \nimpact on mental and physical health. Here we conceive \u2018fear\u2019 as a stressor with direct \nphysiological and behavioural consequences for health, whether through perceived or actual threat \nincreasing the vulnerability to pathogens (Wright et al., 1998; Marsland et al., 2002), or \nstimulating repeated physiological response producing wear and tear on the nervous and immune \nsystems (McEwen, 2007).  \nWhat about the mediating pathways? One behavioural aspect of fear of crime is \navoidance. Restricting how much individuals leave the home and the places they visit reduces \nopportunities to form social ties and participate in social activities. Also lowering the propensity to \nform social ties might be the mistrust in others that results from fear of crime. Social ties and \nsocial activities are protective for physical and mental health and functioning (Sundquist et al., \n2004; Ramsay et al., 2008). Fear of crime may also lead to restrictions in outdoor activities, \nincluding walking and cycling, and to increased car use, meaning that those who fear crime may \n 9\ntherefore be less physically active, a lifestyle which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, \npoor mental health and poorer physical and cognitive functioning. \n \nFinal words \nThis paper found a robust association using longitudinal data and measures of mental and physical \nhealth that links poor health onto heightened worry about crime. In combination with previous \nfindings we propose a feedback model where there is a core to worry about crime that harms \nhealth, which in turn maintains or elevates levels of emotional response to crime (Figure 2). We \nhave argued that the evidence marshaled from the Whitehall II study highlights a real significance \nof fear of crime on well-being. While it is important to address the social perception that drives \nsensibilities about crime, we believe that it would be quite wrong to consign fear of crime to being \njust another \u2018discourse\u2019, just another way of displacing anxieties, just another way of talking about \n\u2018broken Britain\u2019 (even an elite conspiracy to \u2018keep the working man down\u2019). Such strong social \nconstructionism suggests a naivety over the reality of some public concerns. Our data combines \nwith previous evidence to suggest that there is a core to the \u2018fear of crime\u2019 \u2013 indeed a core that \nmay overlap with the \u2018everyday worry about crime\u2019 that Farrall and colleagues have identified \n(see Farrall et al., 2009) and the \u2018dysfunctional fear\u2019 of Jackson & Gray (2009). This core exhibits \nin real cycles of vulnerability and public health. The challenge for future empirical enquiry is to \nintegrate into one framework experiential aspects of the fear of crime alongside the layered and \nnuanced expressive features of this complex social phenomenon. \n \n 10\nFunding \n \nThe Whitehall II study has been supported by grants from the Medical Research Council; the \nBritish Heart Foundation; the Health and Safety Executive; the Department of Health; the US \nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (grant HL36310); the US National Institute on Aging; \nthe Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (grant HS06516); and the John D. and Catherine \nT.
