Menk8\nReceived 28 March 2008; revised 10 June 2008; accepted 1 August 2008; published 30 October 2008.\n[1] Geosynchronous Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL-97A) satellite particle\ndata, riometer data, and radio wave data recorded at high geomagnetic latitudes in the\nregion south of Australia and New Zealand are used to perform the first complete\nmodeling study of the effect of substorm electron precipitation fluxes on low-frequency\nradio wave propagation conditions associated with dispersionless substorm injection\nevents. We find that the precipitated electron energy spectrum is consistent with an\ne-folding energy of 50 keV for energies <400 keV but also contains higher fluxes of\nelectrons from 400 to 2000 keV. To reproduce the peak subionospheric radio wave\nabsorption signatures seen at Casey (Australian Antarctic Division), and the peak riometer\nabsorption observed at Macquarie Island, requires the precipitation of 50\u201390% of the\npeak fluxes observed by LANL-97A. Additionally, there is a concurrent and previously\nunreported substorm signature at L < 2.8, observed as a substorm-associated phase\nadvance on radio waves propagating between Australia and New Zealand. Two\nmechanisms are discussed to explain the phase advances. We find that the most likely\nmechanism is the triggering of wave-induced electron precipitation caused by waves\nenhanced in the plasmasphere during the substorm and that either plasmaspheric\nhiss waves or electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves are a potential source capable of\nprecipitating the type of high-energy electron spectrum required. However, the presence of\nthese waves at such low L shells has not been confirmed in this study.\nCitation: Clilverd, M. A., et al.

Introduction\n[2] In this study we analyze ground-based ionospheric\ndata from middle and high latitudes in the region around\nAustralia and New Zealand during dispersionless substorm\ninjection events. We use data from 2005 to 2007 to show\nthat ionization signatures of substorm injection events can\nbe observed at both L \u0001 4\u201312 and L \u0001 2.4\u20132.8, despite the\nwell known low-latitude limit of particle precipitation being\nL \u0001 4.0 [Berkey et al., 1974]. We use radio waves, riometers\nand geostationary spacecraft data to show that the timing of\nthe precipitation events at L \u0001 2.4\u20132.8 is the same as at\nL \u0001 5, but delayed with respect to the injection signature at\ngeostationary orbit (L = 6.6).\n[3] Substorm injection events were comprehensively\nmapped by Berkey et al. [1974] using about 40 Northern\nHemisphere riometers in the IQSY (1964\u20131965) and IASY\n(1969). Typically, energetic electron precipitation from a\nsubstorm occurs near midnight, rapidly expanding eastward\nwith velocities that correspond to electron drift velocities\nassociated with energies of 50\u2013300 keV. Initially the riom-\neter absorption maximum is located close to 65\u0001 geomagnetic\nlatitude (L\u0001 6) but expands within 15 min to cover a latitude\nrange of 60\u201373\u0001 geomagnetic (L= 4\u201312). This latitude range\nis consistent with the observations from particle detectors\non DMSP flights [Sandholt et al., 2002]. After 15 min the\nlongitudinal extent of the substorm precipitation region is\n\u0001100\u0001. The longitudinal expansion can continue for more\nthan an hour until substorm signatures are observed at most\nlocal times, although no further increase in latitudinal extent\noccurs. The electron energies involved in substorm injec-\ntions seen by satellites such as LANL are typically 50\u2013\n1000 keV, with the highest fluxes occurring at the lowest\nenergies [Baker et al., 1985].

The primary difficulty is in making\nobservations of electron populations in the spatially narrow\nloss cone, particularly around the geomagnetic equator\nwhere geostationary satellites reside.\n[4] The injection of energetic electrons during a substorm\nhas been modeled by considering an electromagnetic pulse\npropagating earthward, interacting with a preexisting elec-\ntron population [Sarris et al., 2002]. The rate of inward drift\nof the electron population driven by radial diffusion has\nbeen shown to gradually decrease with decreasing L shell.\nClose to the injection latitude, that is, at a single local time,\nthe radialmotion is typically 25 km s\u00021, slowing to\u000115 km s\u00021\nat about L = 5. Calculations at L shells below L = 4 have not\nbe made because of the observed limits of substorm\ninjection precipitation, but simple extrapolation of the\npublished data suggests speeds of \u000110 km s\u00021 at L = 2.8,\nassuming it is possible for the injection to penetrate inside\nL = 4. The results of Sarris et al. [2002] suggest that\nbetween the time delay of an injection signature at geosta-\ntionary obit and L = 5.4 is 5 min, while for the same\ninjection to reach L = 2.8 would be a further \u000120 min.\n[5] Energetic electron precipitation during substorms has\nbeen studied using riometers [e.g., Jelly and Brice, 1967],\nforward scatter radar [e.g., Bailey, 1968], and VLF radio\nwaves [e.g., Thorne and Larsen, 1976]. The VLF radio\nwave technique has an advantage in that it is most sensitive\nto ionization caused by relativistic electron precipitation\nenergies, typically >100 keV, as these energies ionize the\nneutral atmosphere in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide, that\nis, at altitudes below \u000170 km. Thorne and Larsen [1976,\nand references therein] reported that electron fluxes of\n\u0003103 el. cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 were required at energies of\n>200 keV in order to account for radio signal disturbances\nduring substorms, observed over the latitudes 4.5 \u0004 L \u0004\n6.0. Larsen and Thomas [1974] used the ERSO 1A satellite\nto estimate that the trapped electron spectrum during a\nsubstorm could be represented by an e-folding energy of\nabout 50 keV (using 176\u2013434 keV energies). The energy\nspectrum of the electron precipitation into the atmosphere\nwas found to be of the same form as the trapped fluxes\n[Rosenberg et al., 1972] with the maximum precipitated\nfluxes comparable with the trapped fluxes [Larsen and\nThomas, 1974].\n[6] In this study we use LANL particle data, riometer\ndata, and radio wave data recorded at high geomagnetic\nlatitudes to identify the occurrence of substorm injection\nevents in a region south of Australia and New Zealand. Data\nsets from high-latitude locations (Casey and Macquarie\nIsland, Australian Antarctic Division) and the geostationary\nsatellite LANL-97A are used to describe the high-latitude\nelectron precipitation driven by dispersionless substorm\ninjections. Additionally, we present radio wave data\nrecorded at Dunedin, New Zealand to show that there is a\nconcurrent and unexpected substorm signature at L < 2.8,\nbut that no clear signature of the substorms can be detected\nin a riometer also located in Dunedin. We discuss the\npotential mechanisms that could cause the observed radio\nwave signature, including the precipitation of radiation belt\nelectrons by electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, and the\npossibility of distant scattering of radio waves by the\nexpected ionospheric ionization feature at L > 4 in a similar\nway to medium-latitude Trimpi.\n2. Experimental Setup\n[7] This paper combines data from subionospheric VLF\nradio wave receivers, a geostationary LANL satellite, and\nground-based riometers to describe the spatial variability of\nenergetic particle precipitation into the middle atmosphere\nduring substorm events. This section describes each instru-\nment, and its relevance to this study. An overview of the\nexperimental setup is given in Figure 1 which shows a map\nof the Australia\/New Zealand\/Antarctic region, and includes\nthe locations of all of the instruments described in this\nsection. The oval shown in Figure 1 depicts a typical\nsubstorm precipitation region shortly after the onset, deter-\nmined from the analysis of riometer data [Berkey et al.,\n1974].\n[8] Here we use narrowband subionospheric VLF radio\nwave data, transmitted from two Australian sites (NTS,\n18.6 kHz, and NWC 19.8 kHz) received at two sites: Casey,\nAntarctica (66.3\u0001S, 110.5\u0001E, L > 999), and Dunedin,\nNew Zealand (45.9\u0001S, 170.5\u0001E, L = 2.8). These receiving\nsites are part of the Antarctic-Arctic Radiation-Belt\nDynamic Deposition VLF Atmospheric Research Konsortia\nFigure 1.

The location of the Macquarie Island riometer is\nindicated by a square. The gray oval represents a typical\nregion of substorm precipitation shortly after onset, where\nthe L-shell contours indicate the likely limits of precipitation.\nA10311 CLILVERD ET AL.: SUBSTORM PRECIPITATION SIGNATURES\n2 of 12\nA10311\n(AARDDVARK, for a comprehensive description of the\narray visit www.physics.otago.ac.nz\/space\/AARDDVARK_\nhomepage.htm). The effects of changing ionization condi-\ntions in the mesosphere, due to energetic particle precipita-\ntion, can be observed along the propagation path between a\nVLF transmitter and a receiver. Subionospheric propagation\nis sensitive to ionization located below about 90 km. The\neffect of increased ionization on the propagating signals can\nbe seen as either an increase or decrease in signal amplitude\nor phase depending on the modal mixture of each signal\nobserved [Barr et al., 2000; Clilverd et al., 2006b]. This\nstudy reports only amplitude results from Casey because\nthere are no current measurements of phase available from\nthat site. Phase and amplitude data are available at Dunedin,\nalthough we typically show phase only to reduce the\nnumber of plots per figure, and because the phase response\nis more consistent from substorm to substorm. The great\ncircle paths from NWC and NTS received at Dunedin and\nCasey are shown in Figure 1.\n[9] The LANL spacecraft data used in this study are from\nthe Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer (SOPA) on LANL-\n97A (L \u0001 6.6, 138\u0001E). We concentrate on data from LANL-\n97A because the L-shell footprint of the satellite is located\nin the ocean south of Australia, and lies close to the great\ncircle paths of signals from NTS and NWC received at\nCasey. In subsequent analysis we show the LANL-97A\nelectron flux in the energy range 75\u2013105 keV [Belian et al.,\n1992] because electrons with these energies will create\nionization at altitudes of \u000180 km, and thus significantly\ninfluence the electron density profile of the nighttime lower\nionosphere.\n[10] The riometer data used in this study are provided\nfrom instruments located at Dunedin (45.9\u0001S, 170.5\u0001E,\nL = 2.8) and Macquarie Island (54.5\u0001S, 158.9\u0001E, L = 5.4).\nThe riometers are wide-beam, 30 MHz, vertical pointing\nparallel dipole systems, with time resolutions of 1\u201310 s,\nalthough we typically present 1 min average data. Riometers\n[Little and Leinbach, 1959] will observe the integrated\nabsorption of cosmic radio noise through the ionosphere,\nwith increased absorption due to additional ionization due to\nboth proton and electron precipitation. The dominant alti-\ntude of the absorption is typically in the range 70\u2013100 km,\nthat is, biased toward relatively soft particle energies\n(\u000130 keV electrons).\n3. Results\n[11] The first substorm event period is shown in Figure 2.\nFigures 2a\u20132e show (in descending geomagnetic latitude)\nthe amplitude variation of the NTS transmitter received at\nCasey, the LANL-97A 75\u2013105 keV electron flux, the\nMacquarie Island riometer absorption, the phase of NTS\nreceived at Dunedin, and the phase of NWC received at\nDunedin. The time axis shows the period 1200\u20131600 UT on\n1 March 2006. The local time in the plot is approximately\nUT + 9, and thus the plot represents the time period centered\naround local midnight. The LANL-97A flux data shows that\na substorm injection started at 1336 UT (close to 2300MLT),\nand this time is highlighted by a dotted vertical line. We use\n75\u2013105 keV electron flux data from LANL-97A because\nprecipitating electrons in that energy range will create\nionization at altitudes below the nighttime D region and\nthus should be detected using subionospherically propagat-\ning radio waves, for example, the NTS signal received at\nCasey. The LANL-97A energy channels show that the\nsubstorm injection at 1336 UT is dispersionless (not shown\nhere), and thus the local time of the injection region is close\nto the local time of the Southern Hemisphere footprint of\nLANL-97A. In Figures 2a\u20132e the vertical dotted lines\nrepresent the time at which the substorm signature is\nobserved, while the dashed quasi-horizontal lines represent\nthe undisturbed behavior of each signal.\n[12] In Figure 2 it can been seen that the Casey radio\nwave amplitude decrease and the LANL-97A injection\ntiming are very similar. The Casey radio wave amplitude\nchanges show a similar temporal variation to the LANL-\n97A fluxes, last about the same length of time (\u00010.6 h), and\nhave a peak effect (in this case 12 dB) at about the same\ntime. Further coincidence is seen in the decrease in ampli-\ntude at about 1500 UT, which is consistent with the return of\n100 keVelectrons having drifted around the Earth at L = 6.6\n(drift period 1.33 h) which can also be seen in the LANL-\n97A fluxes. The absorption signature in the Macquarie\nIsland riometer starts \u00010.1 h (\u00016 min) later than the\nLANL-97A timing, at 1342 UT, consistent with penetration\nto lower L shells. However, the 40\u201360\u0001 phase changes in\nthe radio wave signals received at Dunedin occur at the\nsame time as the 2.5 dB absorption peak in the Macquarie\nriometer. Phase changes of this magnitude are often associ-\nated with significant perturbations of the ionosphere such as\nsolar flare events [Thomson et al., 2005] and are substan-\ntially larger than whistler-induced precipitation signatures\nseen at midlatitudes [Helliwell et al., 1973; Barr et al.,\n2000]. The peak effects in absorption and phase change are\nnot observed at the same time as the LANL-97A flux peak,\nbut the Macquarie riometer and Dunedin radio wave data do\nshow effects lasting approximately the same length of time,\nthat is, 1.5 h.\n[13] A second substorm event is shown in Figure 3. The\nevent occurred at 1542 UT on 27 March 2006 (\u00010200 LT)\nand is plotted in the same format as Figure 2. Figure 3a\nshows the change in radio wave amplitude for the NTS\nsignal received at Casey. As in Figure 2, the start of the\nsubstorm in the LANL-97A electron fluxes is the same as\nthat seen in the radio wave data from Casey, but the\nMacquarie riometer and Dunedin subionospheric data again\nFigure 2.

Although the LANL-\n97A injection signature shows a two-peaked structure\nduring the substorm, none of the ground-based experiments\nshow this, and instead, show a gradual rise to a maximum\neffect \u00010.3\u20130.6 h after the start of the event. Similarly, all\nthe ground-based experiments showed that the substorm\nevent lasted until \u00011730 UT, while the LANL-97A sub-\nstorm signature appears to end at \u00011648 UT. Typically this\nevent caused an approximately 15 dB effect in the NTS-\nCasey signal, 1 dB of absorption in the Macquarie Island\nriometer, and a 20\u201340\u0001 phase advance in the radio wave\nsignals received at Dunedin.\n[14] In Table 1 we show a list of six substorm events that\nhave produced notable phase increases in the Dunedin radio\nwave data and two that showed very small effects at\nDunedin. The columns represent the time of the injection\nas determined from the LANL data, the delay to onset time\nobserved in the Macquarie Island riometer measurements,\nthe size and the duration of the phase advance observed in\nthe Dunedin subionospheric recordings, and the delay of the\nphase advance onset time at Dunedin compared with the\nMacquarie Island riometer onset time. In the current study\nperiod (January 2006 to December 2007) we have identified\nsix significant (>10\u0001) phase advance events at Dunedin, all\nof which occurred in the months of February to April, and\nno >10\u0001 phase advance events outside these months despite\ngood substorm signatures being observed on occasions by\nall of the other experiments. Typically the phase advances\nare \u000150\u0001, which is much larger than nighttime phase\nchanges associated with whistler-induced electron precipi-\ntation [Lev-Tov et al., 1996; Clilverd et al., 1999; Rodger\net al., 2007b] and comparable with large storm effects\n[Thomson et al., 2007] driven by plasmaspheric hiss-induced\nprecipitation [Rodger et al., 2007a].\n[15] The average substorm occurrence time in Table 1 is\njust after magnetic midnight, and the delay between LANL-\n97A and the Macquarie riometer signature is typically\n0.10\u20130.15 h (6\u20139 min). On average the Macquarie riometer\nabsorption and the Dunedin phase advances last for the\nsame time, that is, \u00011.5 h. In five out of the eight events the\nDunedin phase advance onset occurs at the same time as\nthe Macquarie riometer absorption onset, however in one\nevent (27 February 2007) there is no delay between the\nMacquarie riometer, LANL-97A, and Casey amplitude but a\n\u000140 min delay to the Dunedin phase advance event.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. High-Latitude Precipitation Fluxes\n[16] Figure 4 shows the diurnal variation in amplitude of\nNTS received at Casey. Mesospheric ionization effects on\nVLF\/LF wave propagation can be modeled using the Long\nWave Propagation Code (LWPC) [Ferguson and Snyder,\n1990]. LWPC models VLF signal propagation from any\npoint on Earth to any other point. Given electron density\nprofile parameters for the upper boundary conditions,\nLWPC calculates the expected amplitude and phase of the\nVLF signal at the reception point. In Figure 4 the diamonds\nindicate undisturbed LWPC model amplitude values for the\npath using the Thomson [1993] daytime model ionosphere,\nand the Thomson et al. [2007] nighttime model ionosphere.\nThe substorm effect at Casey can be seen at\u00011300\u20131400UT\nas a sudden decrease in amplitude of \u000112 dB, lasting \u00011 h.\nTable 1.

This knowledge can be used as\na starting point in investigating the substorm-induced\nchanges. In Figures 2 and 3 there is no delay between the\nLANL-97A substorm flux enhancements and the amplitude\nchanges of NTS received at Casey. The propagation path\npasses through the expected region of electron precipitation\nduring the substorm, and close to the LANL-97A southern\ngeomagnetic footprint location (Figure 1), so the ionization\nchanges in that region should be responsible for the ampli-\ntude changes observed. Thus we should be able to model the\nimpact on the transmitter signals using precipitation\ndescribed by LANL-97A fluxes applied on only a central\nportion of the transmitter-receiver great circle path delimited\nby the dotted lines at L = 4 and L = 12.5 shown in Figure 1.\nThese higher and lower L-shell boundaries are estimated\nfrom previous studies of substorm injections patterns [e.g.,\nFriedel et al., 1996] and supported in these cases by the\nobservation of riometer signatures near the lower L-shell\nboundary by the Macquarie Island data.\n[17] The ionization rate due to precipitating energetic\nelectrons is calculated by an application of the expressions\nof Rees [1989], expanded to higher energies on the basis of\nthe work of Goldberg and Jackman [1984]. The energy\nspectrum shown in Figure 5a is taken from the fit to the\nLANL-97A observations during the substorm event shown\nin Figure 2, using measured fluxes in the energy range\n50\u20132500 keV. As the precipitating flux magnitude is\nunknown, and the topic of this subsection, we consider\nwhat electron precipitation flux best reproduces our sub-\nionospheric radio wave data for the event on 1 March 2006\nusing the fitted energy spectrum. For this reason, we made\nuse of a simple ionospheric model to describe the balance of\nelectron number density, Ne, in the lower ionosphere, based\non that given by Rodger et al. [1998], and further described\nby Rodger et al. [2007a]. We summarize the model here as it\nis relevant to this paper. The background neutral atmosphere\nis calculated using the NRLMSISE-00 neutral atmospheric\nmodel [Picone et al., 2002]. In the simple Rodger model the\nevolution of the electron density with time is governed by\nthe equation\n@Ne\n@ t\n\u00bc q\u0002 bNe \u0002 aN2e ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere q is the ionization rate, a is the recombination\ncoefficient (m3 s\u00021), and b is the attachment rate (s\u00021).\nRodger et al. [2007a] provides expressions for the altitude\nvariation of a and b, appropriate for nighttime and daytime\nconditions.\n[18] The electron number density profiles determined\nusing the simple ionospheric electron model for varying\nprecipitation flux magnitudes are used as input to the LWPC\nsubionospheric propagation model. They are applied on\nonly a central portion of the transmitter-receiver great circle\npath delimited by the dotted lines at L = 4 and L = 12.5\nshown in Figure 1, thus modeling the effect of precipitation\non the NTS amplitudes received at Casey. An undisturbed\nnighttime electron density profile which reproduces the\nreceived NTS amplitudes is used as specified by the Wait\nionosphere b = 0.55 km\u00021 and h0 = 85.5 km for nighttime\nconditions [Thomson et al., 2007]. The difference in the\nLWPC-modeled NTS and NWC amplitude changes for\nvarying precipitation magnitudes, represented as fractions\nof the peak LANL-97A observed flux are shown in Figure 5b.\nThe horizontal dotted line indicates the peak experimentally\nobserved amplitude differences of \u000212 \u00b1 1 dB at \u00011400 UT\non 1 March 2006 (an amplitude decrease of \u000214 \u00b1 1 dB was\nobserved on NWC). The peak experimental NTS amplitude\ndifference is best modeled by a precipitating flux which is\n\u00010.1% or 30\u201370% of the LANL-97A peak flux reported\nduring the substorm, while for NWC it is 50\u2013100% or\n\u0001800% (the latter being unreasonably high). The results\nshown indicate that although multiple precipitation flux\nlevels can lead to the same amplitude difference on each\ntransmitter, we expect the 50\u201370% precipitating flux value\nto be the most representative of the actual situation because\nit is the only solution that matches the observations for both\ntransmitters. In addition, previous work has suggested that\nvalues just below or near 100% are most appropriate.\nHowever, in the paragraphs below we also confirm this\nfinding using riometer data. Figure 5c shows the electron\ndensity profile changes induced by the substorm precipita-\ntion that ranges from 50% to 100% of the LANL-97A flux\nlevels at the peak of the substorm on 1 March 2006.\n[19] By calculating height-integrated differential absorp-\ntion using a method described by Verronen et al. [2006],\nand using the electron density profile shown in Figure 5c we\ncan estimate the expected riometer absorption for the\nMacquarie Island riometer. We find that precipitating\n100% of the peak LANL-97A >30 keV flux during the\nsubstorm gives 4.5 dB of absorption, and that we require\n50% to reproduce the observed 3 dB peak substorm effect\nshown in Figure 2. A separate calculation based on an\nimplementation of the Appleton-Hartree equation, where\n\u2018\u2018merged\u2019\u2019 electron density and collision frequency profiles\nare integrated over height range [Beharrell and Honary,\n2008], suggests that 90% of the peak LANL-97A fluxes are\nrequired. These values are consistent with the flux values\ndetermined by fitting the radio wave propagation observa-\ntions (Figure 5b). Presumably, VLF, electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron (EMIC), or other waves are responsible for\ncontinuously moving the majority of the injected particles\ninto the loss cone, which would explain why the LANL and\nprecipitating fluxes are comparable. But we note that the\npitch angle scattering would have to be operating in a very\nefficient manner. The other alternative is that the substorm\nmechanism has a strong preference toward the injection of\nFigure 5. (a) The LANL energy spectra during the peak of the 1 March 2006 substorm injection. (b) The effect of LANL-\n97A electron precipitation on the NTS-Casey amplitudes as the fluxes are varied. The maximum amplitude change\nobserved at Casey is represented by the horizontal dashed line, indicating a maximum precipitation flux of \u000150\u2013100% of\nthe LANL-97A peak spin-averaged differential flux.

There is\ngood agreement between the fit to the LANL-97A trapped\nflux and the 50 keV e-folding spectrum up to \u0001400 keV.\nHowever, for energies >400 keV the LANL-97A spectrum\nhas significantly higher fluxes. To reproduce the substorm\nsignature in the radio wave data the 50% precipitated flux\nproduces 1.5 \t 105 el. cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 for >200 keV\nenergies. This is substantially greater that the fluxes of\n\u0003103 el. cm\u00022 s\u00021 sr\u00021 for >200 keV electrons reported by\n[Thorne and Larsen, 1976]. The precipitated electron spec-\ntrum also has higher fluxes than the 50 keV e-folding\nspectra for energies >400 keV, but without these high-\nenergy fluxes we are unable to accurately model the radio\npropagation effects of the substorm for precipitating fluxes\nwhich were 50% of the peak value reported by LANL-97A:\nthe difference between using the high-energy flux compo-\nnent of the spectra or not being 7 dB for NWC and 2 dB for\nNTS. These highly relativistic electrons will penetrate\ndeeply into the atmosphere and impact the chemistry of\nthe stratosphere and lower mesosphere (see Turunen et al.\n[2008] for a review of the potential chemical effects of\nrelativistic electron precipitation into the middle atmosphere).\n[21] The time delay between the beginning of the sub-\nstorm injection in the LANL-97A particle data at L = 6.6\nand the lower latitude Macquarie Island riometer data (L =\n5.4) is typically 6\u20139 min. Figure 1 shows that the LANL\ngeomagnetic field line footprint location and the riometer\nlocation are separated by \u000120\u0001 of longitude and \u00018\u0001 of\nlatitude. However, the longitudinal expansion of the sub-\nstorm precipitation is fast and typically covers \u0001100\u0001 in the\nfirst 15 min [Berkey et al., 1974]. Thus, potentially \u00013 min\nof delay could occur between the two sites as a result of\nlongitudinal expansion of the precipitation region. However,\nthe results from Sarris et al. [2002] suggest that most of the\n6\u20139 min delay is consistent with injection propagation\ntimes from L = 6.6 to L = 5.4 (1.2 Re at 25 km s\n\u00021 takes\n5 min).\n4.2. Midlatitude Phase Advance Signatures\n[22] In section 3 we showed that there were subiono-\nspheric phase advances observed at the midlatitude record-\ning site in Dunedin which were associated with the\nsubstorms observed at higher L shells. Although the mid-\nlatitude phase advances were delayed with respect to the\nsubstorm onset timing shown by the high-latitude observa-\ntions from LANL-97A (L = 6.6) and the Casey subiono-\nspheric data, they were not delayed with respect to the\nMacquarie Island riometer observations (L = 5.4). This\nmidlatitude substorm phase advance signature has not been\nreported before and may be caused by one of several\nmechanisms.\n[23] The most obvious candidate mechanism is direct\nprecipitation from the substorm injection event. We note\nthat this mechanism seems unlikely as previous work\nshowed that the low-latitude boundary of electron precipi-\ntation from substorms determined by riometers is L = 4, as\nwe discussed in section 1 [Berkey et al., 1974]. However, it\nis possible that lower latitude electron precipitation is\ncaused by electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves (EMIC)\nassociated with a region of high plasmaspheric electron\ndensity gradients. The effectiveness of the mechanism has\nrecently been shown by Clilverd et al. [2007], with signa-\ntures occurring in the phase of subionospherically propa-\ngating radio waves just as reported in this study. This\nelectron precipitation mechanism would require EMIC-\ninduced precipitation to be triggered by the substorm at a\ndensity gradient region either well inside the plasmasphere,\nor from a compressed plasmapause. The EMIC triggered\nelectron precipitation at L \u0001 2.5 inferred by Clilverd et al.\n[2007] was caused by the intense coronal mass ejection\nevent of 21 January 2005 [Clilverd et al., 2006a] and thus\nwas associated with a very large storm event, rather than the\nsubstorm events considered in the current paper. Observa-\ntional evidence of the presence of EMIC waves at higher L\nshells during these substorms comes from two of the\nAutomated Geophysical Observatories (AGOs) pulsation\nmagnetometers in Antarctica, covering L = 6\u20138, which\nare at such high L shells that they do not support or refute\nthe possibility of EMIC waves at L \u0001 2.7.\n[24] If direct electron precipitation is causing the midlat-\nitude phase advances seen in Figures 2 and 3 then we would\nexpect to observe some signature of it on the riometer data\nfrom Dunedin (see Figure 1 for the NWC and NTS paths to\nDunedin). Figure 7 shows a substorm-associated phase\nadvance that occurred on 10 March 2005. Although the\nformat is similar to that of Figures 2 and 3, Figure 7d shows\nriometer absorption data from Dunedin (L = 2.8). No\nDunedin riometer data is available for 2006, so we have\nto show data from 2005 which was before our instrument at\nCasey was operational, and consequently substorm events\nfrom 2005 were not initially selected for this study. Figure 7\nFigure 6. The LANL trapped flux energy spectra for the\n1 March 2006 substorm injection (squares), compared with\nthe E0 = 50 keV e-folding spectra estimated by Larsen and\nThomas [1974] from a relativistic electron precipitation\nevent observed by the ESRO 1A satellite (circles). The peak\nsubstorm-precipitated electron flux determined from the\nradio wave data is also shown (crosses).\nA10311 CLILVERD ET AL.: SUBSTORM PRECIPITATION SIGNATURES\n9 of 12\nA10311\nshows that a substorm injection event occurred in the LANL\ndata at 1448 UT, with a resultant 1.5 dB absorption\nsignature on the Macquarie Island riometer seen \u00015 min\nlater. A small phase advance is seen at the same time on\nNTS received at Dunedin, all of which is consistent with the\npattern of events shown in Figures 2 and 3. In contrast, the\nDunedin riometer shows no significant absorption coinci-\ndent with the event timing. Thus we conclude that either there\nis no direct electron precipitation occurring at L = 2.4\u20132.8\nin this event, or that the energy of the precipitating electrons\nis so high that no significant absorption is produced in the\nriometer data. An energy spectra dominated by relativistic\nelectrons (energies 1\u20132 MeV) is consistent with the\nexpected spectrum driven by EMIC [Loto\u2019aniu et al.,\n2006], which might produce changes in subionospheric\npropagation without creating a significant change in riom-\neter absorptions. EMIC waves have been associated with\nsubstorm particle injections [Erlandson and Ukhorskiy,\n2001].\n[25] Central to the question of the mechanism that drives\nthe midlatitude phase advances is the observation that there\nis little timing delay between the Macquarie Island riometer\ndata, and the Dunedin subionospheric phase advances. This\nis clearly not consistent with the propagation of an injection\nFigure 7. (a\u2013d) A plot of the effects of a substorm on 10 March 2005. The format is similar to that of\nFigure 2 but with Figure 7d representing the Dunedin riometer data. No NWC or NTS-Casey amplitude\ndata are available for this event.\nA10311 CLILVERD ET AL.: SUBSTORM PRECIPITATION SIGNATURES\n10 of 12\nA10311\nevent, which the results of Sarris et al. [2002] suggest\nwould take an additional \u000120 min. If direct precipitation is\noccurring then it is being triggered when the injection\narrives at Macquarie Island latitudes. One possibility is an\nenhancement of EMIC wave activity in the plasmasphere,\ntriggered as the injection reaches the plasmapause (or just\noutside this region). Another possibly, summarized by\nRodger and Clilverd [2008] is the enhancement of, and\nthen propagation of, waves from outside the plasmapause\ninto the plasmasphere: Bortnik et al. [2008] showed that\nchorus outside the plasmapause could appear inside the\nplasmasphere as plasmaspheric hiss with delay times of\nonly a few seconds. In addition, Rodger et al. [2007a]\nshowed that plasmaspheric hiss could produce significant\nelectron precipitation at L \u0001 3.0 during geomagnetic storms,\nalthough the hiss provided an electron precipitation energy\nspectrum with significant fluxes of electrons <1 MeV which\nwould not necessarily agree with the Dunedin riometer data\nshown in Figure 7.\n[26] Another mechanism that could produce a substorm-\nassociated phase advance on obliquely propagating radio\nwaves is off great circle-path scattering from the ionization\ngenerated in the substorm precipitation zone between L = 4\nand L = 12. The patch of substorm ionization located below\nthe normal altitude of the D region lower boundary could\nscatter the radio waves from the transmitters in Australia\nback toward the receiver in Dunedin and constructively\/\ndestructively interfere with the direct signal from transmitter\nto receiver [e.g., Dowden and Adams, 1993; Clilverd et al.,\n2002]. Off-path scattering from sprites has only been\nreported from ionization patches located within \u0001200 km\nof the propagation path. In addition, the high-angle off-path\nscattering requires regionally small, electrically \u2018\u2018dense,\u2019\u2019\nionization patches rather than the spatially large features\nexpected from substorm precipitation zone extending from\nL = 4 to higher L shells.\n[27] Finally, we note one final characteristic of substorm-\nassociated phase advances, which is the preponderance of\nthe observations occurring in the autumn equinox (February\nto April). Six of the eight events shown in Table 1 occur\nduring this time frame, while the substorm events investi-\ngated outside this period showed either no phase change or\nvery little (<10\u0001) change. The observed seasonal preference\nin substorm-associated subionospheric phase advances\ncould be due to changes in the efficiency of the mechanism\nwhich is altering the electrical properties of the lower D\nregion, which we monitor by the subionospheric propaga-\ntion. Another possibility is that the mechanism is occurring\nwith the same efficiency outside those months, but that there\nis a lack of sensitivity in the underlying radio wave\npropagation conditions to those ionospheric alterations.\nAnswering these questions requires future studies which\nidentify the mechanism by which the midlatitude iono-\nsphere is modified by high-latitude substorms.\n5. Summary\n[28] Data from high-latitude locations (Casey and\nMacquarie Island, Australian Antarctic Division) and the\ngeostationary satellite LANL-97A, all in the region south of\nAustralia and New Zealand, are used to describe and model\nhigh-latitude electron precipitation driven by substorm\ninjection events. We find that electron precipitation im-\nposed over the latitude range associated with substorm\nprecipitation, and with the energy spectrum observed by\nthe LANL-97A instrument, can be used to model the\nsubionospheric radio wave substorm signature seen at Casey.\nThemaximum required precipitation rate into the atmosphere\nis found to be 50\u201390% of the peak fluxes measured by the\nLANL-97A spacecraft. The electron energy spectrum is\nconsistent with an e-folding energy of 50 keV for energies\n<400 keV, but also contains higher fluxes of electrons from\n400 to 2000 keV.\n[29] Additionally, we present radio wave data recorded at\nmidlatitudes, that is, Dunedin, New Zealand, to show that\nthere is a concurrent substorm-associated phase advance\nsignature at L < 2.8, but that no clear signature of any\nsubstorms can be detected in a riometer also located in\nDunedin. Three mechanisms have been discussed to explain\nthe phase advances, including the precipitation of radiation\nbelt electrons, both by direct substorm electron precipitation\nor possibly indirectly by electromagnetic ion cyclotron\nwave interactions, and the distant scattering of radio waves\nby the ionization feature at L > 4 in a similar way to low-\nlatitude Trimpi or VLF Sprites. We find that the most likely\nmechanism considered in this paper is the triggering of\nenergetic electron precipitation during the substorm, con-\nsistent with EMIC wave-particle interactions, although the\npresence of these waves has not been directly observed.\n[30] Acknowledgments.
