(Meliaceae). Loci were isolated from an enriched library derived from a single \nDNA sample from a tree in Costa Rica. Levels of polymorphism were determined using \nsamples from a large progeny trial. Across loci, the number of alleles ranged from 14 to 30. \nObserved heterozygosity levels ranged from 0.61 to 0.88. No linkage disequilibria were \ndetected although some departures from HWE were found, probably due to a Wahlund effect. \n2 \nCedrela odorata (Meliaceae), known as Cedro Amargo or Spanish Cedar, is a high-value \nspecies of the Mahogany family, widely distributed in the neotropics (Holdridge et al. 1997). \nInternationally valued for its high quality wood, C. odorata has been used for construction, \nfurniture and boat building amongst other things (Cordero and Boshier 2003). As a result, \nheavy selective logging has severely reduced wild populations, to the point that the species is \nnow threatened at a provenance level (Pati\u00f1o 1997).  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \nPrevious studies have assessed genetic structure using AFLP and universal chloroplast DNA \nmarkers (Cavers et al 2003a,b) and quantitative traits (Navarro et al. 2005), thoroughly \ndescribing genetic variation in the species at a landscape scale in Mesoamerica. Now, \nattention is turning to restoration efforts and best practice for sourcing seed. A major progeny \ntrial is now underway in Costa Rica to examine the effects of landscape context on progeny \nfitness, as recent studies have shown that alteration of the forest surrounding seed trees \nchanges gene flow patterns (e.g. Rocha and Aguilar, 2001), with potentially significant \nconsequences for inbreeding rates in progeny arrays. To enable analysis of mating system \nvariation in these progeny arrays, a set of microsatellites were isolated for C. odorata. Loci \nwere optimised for PCR and screened for polymorphism using 487 individuals in 68 families, \nfrom 12 populations distributed across Mesoamerica.  \n \nDNA was extracted from silica-gel-dried leaf material (DNeasy Plant mini kit, QIAGEN) \nfrom a single adult tree of C. odorata from Costa Rica. A microsatellite library enriched for \ndi- (AG, GT, AT, GC) and trinucleotide (CAA, ATT, GCC) repeats was constructed \nfollowing Edwards et al. (1996). The enriched DNA was cloned into pGEM-T vector and \ntransformed into JM109 cells. A total of 200 clones were sequenced with an Amersham \n3 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nMegaBACE 1000 automated sequencer using DYEnamic ET Terminator Sequencing Kit \n(Amersham Biosciences).  \n \nScreening for polymorphism and optimisation of PCR conditions was carried out using leaf \nmaterial from families from different, widely-separated provenances (Tulum and Xpujil, \nMexico; Cedros, Honduras; Hojancha, Costa Rica) to maximise the potential for detection of \npolymorphism. All microsatellites were amplified using 25.0 ul PCR reactions consisting of \nthe following: 2.0 ul template DNA, 15.4 ul H2O, 2.0 ul primers, 2.5 ul 10X buffer, 0.5 ul \ndNTPs, 0.4 ul BSA, 0.2 ul Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Reactions were run \non a Hybaid MBS thermocycler to the following protocol: 1 min at 94 \u00b0C, then 30 cycles of \n60 s at 94 \u00b0C, 60 s at 55 \u00b0C, 60 s at 72 \u00b0C and finally 5 min at 72 \u00b0C.  Optimal PCR reaction \nconditions for each of the polymorphic pairs were determined by testing a range of annealing \ntemperatures (55.0 -70.3 \u00b0C) and different template DNA concentrations (1:5, 1:10, 1:20 and \n1:1). In all cases the forward primer was labelled with either IRD 700 or 800 fluorescent label \n(MWG Biotech). PCR products were then separated on 6% polyacrylamide gel (25 cm), and \nvisualized using a LI-COR 4200 IR2 automated genotyper. PCR products were run out \nalongside a microSTEP DNA size standard (Microzone Limited) and fragment sizes were \nscored using SAGA\u2122 software. Numbers of alleles were calculated, and observed and \nexpected heterozygosity, exclusion probability (Cervus v3.0, Marshall et al 1998) and null \nallele rate were estimated (Microchecker v2.2.3, van Oosterhout et al. 2004). Tests for Hardy-\nWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium, corrected for multiple comparisons \nand considering 1 individual per family, were carried out using Genepop v3.3 (Raymond & \nRousset 1995). Results for effective numbers of alleles (NA), observed (HO) and expected \nheterozygosity (HE) are reported (Table 1) for the collection as a whole and for a single \npopulation (Tikal) to demonstrate the within-population utility of the markers. \n4 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n \nIn 80% of the sequences a microsatellite motif was detected. However, about 130 sequences \nwere discarded because of unfavourable properties for primer design. In 30 cases primers \nwere designed, using PRIMER 3 software (Rozen & Skalestky 2000). Of these, 9 gave clear, \ninterpretable band patterns and were polymorphic (Table 1). The numbers of alleles per locus \nranged from 14 to 30 with levels of observed heterozygosity from 0.61 to 0.88. Null alleles \nwere detected at rates of >0.05 at ced41, ced61a, ced65 and ced131. In all cases, these are \nmost likely due to scoring errors due to stuttering, as indicated by low frequencies of \nheterozygote genotypes with size differences of a single repeat unit (van Oosterhout et al. \n2004). Across the whole dataset, only loci ced2 and ced44 showed no departure from HWE. \nFor some loci, this was contributed to by the presence of null alleles (highest null allele \nfrequency estimated at locus ced61a with 18.1%, Table 1), but most probably reflects a \nheterozygote deficiency due to combination of samples from several, widely-distributed \npopulations (Wahlund effect). No linkage disequilibria between loci (P > 0.05) were \nobserved, suggesting that these loci should be valuable markers for population genetics and \nparentage analysis for Cedrela odorata.  \n \nReferences \nCavers S, Navarro C, Lowe AJ (2003)a A combination of molecular markers identifies \nevolutionarily significant units in Cedrela odorata L.
