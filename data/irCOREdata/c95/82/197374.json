In light of the simplicity and model character of helium\natoms one would naturally be interested to learn how the\nelectronically excited states become modified when an excited\nhelium atom is placed near one, two, or more helium atoms. A\nstraightforward experiment to investigate this problem is to\nproduce a beam of helium clusters of variable size and to\nphotoexcite these clusters in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV)\nspectral range using synchrotron radiation. Such an experiment\nprobes a disordered arrangement of atoms because helium\nclusters and droplets in a free beam are always liquid. Amolecular\nbeam of clusters is optically thin and absorbs very little light, but\nhelium clusters have a large fluorescence yield. Therefore,\nphotofluorescence yield detection is the method of choice. The\nfirst experiments of 4He clusters of variable size using a VUV\nfluorescence light detector identified a number of bands and it\nwas found that the energies of these excitations, unlike the\nelectronic excitations of heavy rare gas clusters,1,2 did not fit to\na Wannier-type excitonic series.3 Subsequent experiments in-\nvestigated fluorescence decay channels in different wavelength\nregions,4,5 the effect of helium particle density,6 fluorescence in\ncavities within large helium droplets,7 and the possible Rydberg\nnature of the excited states of small helium clusters.8 First\nquantum chemical calculations of an octahedral model cluster\nreported the energies of the n = 2, 3, and 4 states of the central\natom as a function of the internuclear separation in the octah-\nedron.9 Electronic spectra simulations of a perturbed octahedron\nas well as an N = 25 atom-large cluster10 were able to reproduce\npreviously reported experimental data of small clusters.6\nDespite these efforts, we still have an incomplete picture of\nthe electronically excited states of large helium clusters. The\nnumber of states increases dramatically with size making the\ncomputation and interpretation of the results laborious. The\navailability of experimental data that cover the entire size range\nof helium clusters and droplets is prerequisite as a benchmark\nfor testing theoretical interpretation and likewise prerequisite\nin providing evidence for empirical interpretation. Further-\nmore, the comprehensive data set presented in this paper\nshows that each helium cluster size has a specific spectral\nfingerprint. A unique feature of helium clusters and droplets is\nthe 6\u00017 \u00c5 thick surface region where the density drops\nsmoothly from the bulk value to zero.11,11,12 With regard to\nelectronically excited states, such a surface layer represents a\nSpecial Issue: J.

A 2011, 115, 7316\u20137326\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry A ARTICLE\nregion of gradually increasing perturbation where the char-\nacter of excited atoms is expected to change from gas-type to\ncondensed matter behavior. This crossover should produce a\nspecific signature in the absorption and excitation spectra,\nwhich our paper aims to investigate. We report VUV fluor-\nescent yield photoexcitation spectra of 3He and 4He clusters\nand large droplets covering the size range from N = 1 to N >\n107 for 4He clusters and N > 104 for 3He droplets. Compared\nto the early days of such research on helium clusters, reliable\ndata of the average cluster sizes produced at specific source\nconditions is now readily available.11,13 The availability of this\ndata allows a much better assignment of sizes than was possible\nin the early studies.\nOur method is to investigate both stable isotopes of helium,\n3He and 4He. Clusters of the two isotopes differ in their particle\ndensity, liquid 3He being about 75% the density of 4He. A second\nsignificant difference is that beams of 3He clusters are free of\nsmall clusters, because for these, no bound states exist, resulting\nin growth mechanisms entirely different from 4He. Most or all\natoms in a small helium cluster belong to the surface region and\nexhibit a reduced particle density with respect to the bulk. The\nsimilarities between small helium clusters and the surface region\nof large helium clusters make it difficult to distinguish between\nthe two, so 3He cluster beams are therefore very helpful in the\nassignment of spectral features. Features that reflect a reduced\ndensity region can be assigned to the clusters\u2019 surfaces, while\nsmall clusters for which 4He clusters and droplets always\naccompany the beam can be excluded. In addition to looking\nat different isotopes, we also employ time-resolved fluorescence\nyield detection to record excitation spectra related to specific\nrelaxation channels.14\u000116 We observe that short-lived fluores-\ncence excitation spectra show features predominantly related to\nthe bulk, while the opposite holds for the long-lived fluorescence.\nThis difference allows for unambiguous assignment of surface\nfeatures. As our work for the first time comprehensively explores\nthe effect of size, it also represents an important benchmark for\ntheory as well as for other experiments with helium clusters in\nthis energy range.17\u000121\n\u2019EXPERIMENTAL SECTION\nThe experiments were performed at the synchrotron light\nsource DORIS III at HASYLAB\/DESY using the experimental\nend-station CLULU at beamline I. The beamline is equipped\nwith a 15\u0001 normal incidence McPherson monochromator for\nVUV light and differential pumping stages providing windowless\nillumination of the free helium cluster beam. A platinum\/\nosmium-coated grating was used for excitation of helium clusters.\nThe photon flux for this combination was measured earlier.14 In\nthe relevant range from 19 to 26 eV the spectral intensity was to a\ngood approximation constant. Therefore, after conversion of the\ndata into eV, no intensity normalization was performed. The\nspectra presented in this paper are the raw data converted into\neV. Spectra were recorded using 100 \u03bcm wide entrance and exit\nslits giving a resolution of 26 meV.\nThe VUV fluorescence yield was recorded by photon counting\nusing an XP 2020 photomultiplier (Valvo\/Philips) in air. The\nVUV photons were converted to the spectral sensitivity range of\nthe photomultiplier using a plate vacuum coated with a thin film\nof sodium salicylate, just before a window and the photomulti-\nplier. This technique is simple and it was found that the set up\nwas insensitive to visible photons emitted from the helium\nclusters.8 Absorption of a photon leads to a good approximation\nto fluorescence of precisely one VUV photon whose registration\ncan be taken as a measure for photo absorption.14 Limitations\nexist for high excitation energies where autoionization is possible\nand also for very large helium droplets where more than one\nexcitation per synchrotron light pulse may occur. In this case,\nannihilation of the type He* \u00fe He* f He \u00fe He\u00fe \u00fe e is\npossible.22 Time-resolved excitation spectra were recorded by\ncounting photons selectively in \u201ctime-windows\u201d after the excita-\ntion pulse of the synchrotron radiation using Time-To-Ampli-\ntude Converters (TAC) and Constant-Fraction-Discrimination\nfor gating the signals. A time window of 3\u000118 ns after the\nexcitation pulse was set to measure the excitation of short-lived\nfluorescence, and a time-window of 40\u0001172 ns was set to record\nlong-lived fluorescence. The time resolution was limited by the\nuse of sodium salicylate as wavelength converter and estimated to\nbe at least \u223c5 ns.\nThe CLULU end station has been described in detail14 and\nmodifications made for fluorescent spectroscopic experiments of\nhelium clusters have been reported in several publications.3,5,8\nTherefore, here we will only explain the most important features\nrelevant to this paper. 3He and 4He clusters and droplets were\nproduced using supersonic expansion of helium gas through an\norifice of 5 \u03bc in diameter (Frey GmbH, Berlin) into the vacuum.\nWhen the expensive isotope 3He was used, the gas was recycled,\nthat is, collected from the pump exhausts, compressed, and\npurified. Details are described in the literature.8 The CLULU\nend station consists of a helium cluster source cooled by a\ncontinuous flow cryostat (Cryovac) and fluorescence detectors\nwith different characteristics. The cluster source allows the\nnozzles to be cooled down to 6 K and for stagnation pressures\nup to 50 bar to be applied. Nozzles with different diameters can\nbe attached to the cold head. The temperature is controlled by\nresistive heating using a Lake Shore cryo controller, a DT-470\ncryogenic diode, and an ohmic resistive heater. The absolute\ntolerance of the DT-470 diode was (0.5 K, according to\nmanufacturer specifications. As the cluster size is a central issue\nin this paper, and as the nozzle temperature T0 is critical for the\nsize, T0 is indicated for every spectrum.\nThe helium cluster beam was directly excited with monochro-\nmatic synchrotron radiation without using a skimmer to max-\nimize the cluster density. The focus of the beamline was about 5\nmm wide and extended from 0.5 mm after the nozzle to 5.5 mm\ndownstream. The cluster source was mounted on an x,y,z\nmanipulator to maximize overlap of the cluster beam with the\nsynchrotron light but tominimize stray-light from light scattering\noff the nozzle. Fluctuations of the positron beam position in the\nstorage ring required adjustment of the nozzle position at each\nstart of an experimental run. The optimum distance was adjusted\nafter evaluation of seven spectra, each recorded at different\nnozzle-focus separation.\nThe entire vacuum chamber was pumped using a 2200 L\/s\nturbo pump (Pfeiffer). The turbo pump was backed by a roots\/\nrotary stack of 250 L\/s and 40m3\/h pumping speed, respectively.\nThe pressure did not exceed 2 \u0003 10\u00013 mbar (corrected for\nhelium ionization efficiency).\nQuantum Chemical Calculations.Quantum chemical calcu-\nlations using the Bochum suite of wave function based quantum\nchemical ab initio programs23\u000125 were performed for an octahe-\ndral helium model cluster in which the central atom was excited\nand the bond lengths between the center and the \u201csurface\u201d atoms\nwere simultaneously varied. This bond length variation aimed to\n7318 dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp2008489 |J. Phys. Chem. A 2011, 115, 7316\u20137326\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry A ARTICLE\nsimulate the effect of varying density. Excitation energies were\ncalculated using the self-consistent field (SCF) method. The\norbitals were localized at the central atom using a Foster-Boys\nlocalization. Valence state excitations were calculated using the\nstate averaged complete active space SCF method (CASSCF)\nand dynamic correlations were taken into account using the multi-\nconfiguration coupled electron pair approximation (MCCEPA) to\nthe multireference coupled cluster method.25 Rydberg states with\nng 3 were calculated using the frozen-core approximation.26,27 We\nused the 10s basis set of Huzinaga28 contracted to 6s. This basis set\nwas extended by p(2.0,0.7,0.2) and d(1.4,0.4) polarization functions\nas well as by semi-diffuse s(0.03) and p(0.07) functions. For the He\natom at which the core excitation took place it was necessary to use\nthe uncontracted 10s basis set to allow for changes in the orbital\nshape of the 1s orbital. Furthermore, a Rydberg basis of Kaufman\net al.29 which was able to describe Rydberg states up to n = 5 was\nadded at this atom. Details are described in ref 9. The frozen-core\ncalculations allowed us to deduce the average electronic wave\nfunction radius \u00c6r\u00e6.\n\u2019RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAll spectra presented in this paper were recorded using a 5 \u03bcm\norifice and a stagnation pressure of 40 bar. The average cluster\/\ndroplet size was varied by changing the source temperature only.\nFor calibration of the monochromator the wavelength was\nrepeatedly scanned past the 3p1P f 1s1S atomic line at 537 \u00c5\nat stagnation temperatures T0 between 81 and 96 K. At these\ntemperatures, only sharp lines were observed, showing that the\nfeatures were purely due to atoms. The average cluster sizesN in the\nregion from 35 to 22Kwere determined using an exponential-decay\nfit to the data reported byHarms et al.13 togetherwith our data point\nat 81 K representing N = 1 (see Table 2). This turned out to be a\nrobust approach, as shifting the N = 1 data point to temperatures\nlower than 81 K did not change the sizes in the range between 35\nand 22K significantly. The fit toHarms\u2019 data was very good forT0 <\n20 K, but produced larger sizes for higher T0 at 22 and 24 K. We\nsuspect that the cross jet\/pick-upmethod used byHarms et al. is less\nreliable for small helium droplet sizes where doping by the pick-up\nmethod becomes difficult. Using Hagena\u2019s formula for size\ndetermination30 was not an option because of significant deviations\nfrom the ideal gas approximation for helium at low temperatures.\nSpectra were then recorded at progressively lower temperatures,\nstarting with 35 K (Figure 1).\nSpectra of Small 4He Clusters. The spectrum at 35 K shows\nintense sharp lines at the position on the np r 1s transitions\naccompanied by blue-shifted wings. The lines converge toward\nthe atomic ionization limit at 24.56 eV where they overlap\nstrongly, giving rise to large intensities. The spectrum resembles\nthat of dense helium gas in a cell31 with the difference that the\nblue-shifted wing between 21.2 and 22 eV is continuous and does\nnot end abruptly. The abrupt end observed for dense gas was\ninterpreted as an increased density of states, indicating a flat-top\nregion in the He\u0001He* potential energy curves. The continuously\nprogressing shift observed for small helium clusters shows that\nmixing with states higher than n = 2 is very likely involved.\nBetween 23.2 and 23.25 eV, the wing next to the 3p line shows\nless continuity than the 2p wing; a similar \u201cbump\u201d is observed for\nthe wing of the 4p line, indicating a region of increased density of\nstates. Also, a small peak of the dipole-forbidden 3s1S r 1s1S\nexcitation at 22.92 eV is seen as well as a shoulder at the position of\nthe 4s1S r 1s1S excitation at 23.67 eV. These transitions become\nallowed as the spherical symmetry of the electronic wave function is\nmore and more broken as the atoms condense into molecules and\nclusters. Spectra at stagnation temperatures higher than 35 K were\ndifficult to record as the nozzle temperature is more difficult to\nstabilize in this region. They do not show any substantial variation\nwith regard to the spectrum at 35 K. AtT0 = 31 K, corresponding to\nN = 225, the blue-shifted wings further increase in intensity\ncompared to the sharp lines filling the gap between the 3p and 4p\nfeatures. The dipole forbidden 2s1Sr 1s1S excitation at 20.62 eV\ncan be identified as a step in the spectrum and a band expanding up\nto the 2p line. The spectra evolve in a similar way whenT0 is further\nlowered. AtT0 = 28K, a distinct feature, \u201cband B\u201d, superimposed on\nthe 2p wing starts to emerge.\nThe overall intensity of the features decreases with increasing\nprincipal quantum number n. This is expected for Rydberg-type\nsystems because the radial overlap between the ground state and\nexcited state wave function decreases. For larger clusters, this\ndecrease becomes less pronounced. A possible reason is mixing\nof states with stronger contributions from low-lying states. It\nindicates that Rydberg states inside large helium clusters are\nunlikely, as was suspected for NO in helium droplets.32 An\nexception is the intensity of the 2p line. One would expect the\natomic 2p line to be strongest, but the geometry of our window-\nless differential pumping setup (which allows helium atoms to\nflow into the beamline) blocks excitation light at the atomic\nresonances. The resulting intensity available at the focus is very\ndifficult to estimate, but this effect may qualitatively explain why\nthe 2p line, which has the greatest oscillator strength, is weaker\nthan the 3p line, especially for N = 80 large clusters.\nAb Initio Calculations.Figure 2 shows calculated average radii\nof electronic wave functions of octahedral helium clusters as a\nfunction of the bond length using the frozen core approximation.\nFigure 1. Fluorescence excitation spectra of 4He clusters of 80\u0001360\natoms on average (blue line). The fluorescence yield was measured with\na VUV-sensitive detector and may be taken as a measure for the\nphotoabsorption (see text). The spectra are shown using two scales to\nvisualize finer details (green line, belongs to right scale) of the spectral\nfeatures. The intense sharp lines are due to 2p, 3p, 4pr 1s transitions.\n7319 dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp2008489 |J. Phys. Chem.

The dash-\ndotted line shows the average internuclear separation in bulk-liquid\n4He or in the center of large helium droplets which represents the\nlower limit. The wave function radii that belong to internuclear\nseparations on the right-hand side of the dash-dotted line Figure 2\nare those that can be expected in real helium clusters and droplets.\nTo test the validity of the frozen core approximation for lower\nenergies we have calculated the energies of the n = 2 states using\nthe more accurate CASSCF method. We found very good\nqualitative agreement between CASSCF and frozen core, the\nonly difference being a constant offset in energy, and conclude\nthat the average wave function radii \u00c6r\u00e6 produced by the frozen\ncore method provide a convenient, and qualitatively correct\ndescription. The wave functions are labeled in the atomic limit\nas 2s, 2p, 3d, 3s, and 3p. The 3d states split into t2g and eg states\ndue to the octahedral symmetry of the ligand field. This splitting\nis an artifact due to our choice of the model cluster geometry. For\nthe 2s and 2p states two regions can be identified. Internuclear\nseparations smaller than 3 \u00c5 produce large radii increasing up to\n5 \u00c5. Such small internuclear separations are only of importance if\nduring excitations the nuclei are very close, which incidentally\nhappens because of the large zero point motion amplitude.\nAverage internuclear separations smaller than 3.56 \u00c5 do not\nexist. The crossover at 3 \u00c5 shows qualitatively that the electronic\nwave function can easily expand and develop Rydberg character if\nthe internuclear separation is smaller than the radius of the\nelectronic wave function. This is a realistic scenario for small\nhelium clusters where most of the atoms are at the surface, and\nfor excited states where the principal quantum number is larger\nthan 3, because here Rydberg-type excited wave functions exist\nthat are greater than the internuclear separation. These wave\nfunctions can expand into free space or, if n is large enough, over\nthe entire cluster. The same holds for atoms at the surface of large\ndroplets, particularly for high n. Here the excited electron density\nand the atomic density are low and perturbation is minimized.\nClusters with bond lengths greater than 3 \u00c5 produce radii of\n2.8 \u00c5 almost constant in size over the entire bond length range,\nshowing that the character of the electronic wave function\nchanges from Rydberg-type to valence-type. The decrease in\nradii observed when the internuclear separation is decreased\nfrom 6 to 3.5 \u00c5 shows a slight compression of the wave function;\na consequence of increasing perturbation by the electrons of the\n1s orbitals of the neighboring ground state atoms. For n = 3\nstates a similar trend is observed: for two states the electron\nwave function radii increase rapidly when internuclear separa-\ntion becomes smaller than 2.7 \u00c5 and is compressed in the\nintermediate region up to 5 \u00c5. The 3dt2g states have valence\nFigure 2.

The dash-\ndotted line shows the average internuclear separation in bulk-liquid 4He\nand in the center of large helium droplets. All internuclear separations\nlarger than this minimum value occur in helium clusters and droplets\n(see text). The top figure shows wave function radii associated with n = 3\nand the bottom figure shows radii associated with n = 2. The wave\nfunctions are labeled in the atomic limit as 2s, 2p, 3d, 3s, and 3p. The 3d\nstates split into t2g and eg states due to the octahedral field. For the n = 2\nlevels accurate energies were calculated using the CASSCF method and\ncompared with the frozen core result (see text). For the n = 3 levels only\nthe frozen-core approximation was used. For small internuclear separa-\ntions (R < 3 \u00c5) the wave functions develop strong Rydberg character\nwith large electron radii. For n = 3, some levels were found to have\nvalence character throughout the entire bond-length range.\nFigure 3.

This size regime is characterized by the\nappearance of band A at 20.95 eV and band B at 21.57 eV (see text).\nAnother band with a distinct maximum can be identified at 23.8 eV\n(band E, see text and Table 1).\n7320 dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp2008489 |J.

The n = 3 Rydberg wave functions have similar or larger\nradii than the internuclear separations depending on whether the\nexcitation is located in a very small cluster, near the surface or in the\nbulk volume. The calculated energies of the octahedral model\ncluster9 show that the perturbation of the n = 3 states is small when\nthe electron density of the perturbing ground state helium atoms is\nsmall. As a consequence, Rydberg states can develop. The same\nholds for states with n larger than 3. All spectra shown in Figure 1\nbelong to a cluster size regime where in the bulk volume the\ndensity is not high enough to produce shifted bands (bands A\nand B) and where the surface is so dilute that Rydberg states with\nhigh principal quantum numbers can establish.\nMidsized 4He Clusters and Large 4He Droplets. Figure 3\nshows spectra of 4He droplets containing 450\u00011800 atoms. The\nspectral features in this size range are characterized by the\nappearance of discrete bands, notably at 20.95, 21.60, and\n23.85 eV and also, though much weaker, at 20.75 eV. The bands\nat 20.95 and 21.60 eV, named A and B, respectively,3 as well as\nthe band at 23.86 eV (band E)3 shift very slightly toward higher\nwavelengths with increasing cluster size. Closer inspection of\nband A reveals a double-peak structure previously not reported.3\nThe peak at 20.75 eV appears slightly blue-shifted from the\ndipole forbidden 2s1Sr 1s1S excitation at 20.62 eV but does not\nshift further when the cluster size increases. Its intensity increases\nless strongly than the peak at 20.95 eV. The maximum of band B\nshifts from 21.45 eV forN = 450 to 21.58 eV forN = 1200; it then\nstays constant up toN = 2900 and decreases again to 21.53 eV for\nN = 9200. The change of the maximum position between N =\n450 and 1200 reflects the size distribution of clusters in the beam.\nRoughly, for an average size N, the standard deviation \u0394N\n(fwhm) is N.13 We have superimposed the two spectra of N =\n280 andN = 1200 and find the maximum at 20.51 eV. This value\nmatches the energy of band B of 21.52 eV found forN = 720. The\ngood match is consistent with a mean size of the clusters in the\nbeam of N = 720 containing N = 280 and N = 1200 clusters at\nequal proportions, which supports our size assignment.\nBand E appears at a cluster size of N = 450 at 23.80 eV and\nstarts shifting toward 23.86 eV atN = 1200. Themaxima of bands\nB and E are listed in Table 1.\nFigure 4 shows helium droplets in the size range from 2900\natoms to more than 107. The size range fromN = 2900 to 9200 is\ncharacterized by a large intensity increase of band A and B\ncompared to the rest of the spectral features. At T = 15 K,\ncorresponding to clusters ofN = 9200 atoms, one observes some\nflattening of the maximum of band B, indicating saturation. This\ndistortion continues when the source temperature is further\nlowered. At T = 12 K-band B appears rugged and reduced in\nintensity compared toT = 15K. Supersonic expansions of helium\nat a stagnation temperature of 12 K proceed along isentropes that\npass through the critical point.34 Droplets produced under these\nconditions are formed by fragmentation from the liquid phase\nrather than by condensation induced by three-body collision.34\nThe droplets therefore reach sizes that are distinctively\nlarger.34,35 At 7.3 K, the lowest temperature our apparatus was\nable to produce at p0 = 40 bar, the fluorescence yield spectrum\nappears heavily rugged, indicating strong nonlinear effects. We\nnote that the intensity of the sharp 3p resonance line at 23.10 eV\ndoes not alter much when the stagnation temperature is lowered\nto 7.3 K. From 20 to 7.3 K the intensity is almost constant,\nwhereas from T = 35 to 20 K the intensity decreases by about a\nfactor of 4. At source conditions for T0 < 13 K two effects have to\nbe considered: first, the 4He droplets produced are very large.\nDepending on the wavelength droplets containing more than 104\natoms are no longer optically thin, that is, the light transmitted\nthrough a droplet decays exponentially (due to Beer\u2019s law) because\nthe droplets can havemore than one excitation per synchrotron light\nTable 1.

Fluorescence excitation spectra of 4He droplets with sizes of\nN = 2900 to >107. The size range fromN = 2900 to 9200 is characterized\nby the predominant growth of band B in intensity. The spectrum at T0 =\n20 K shows rapid modulations of the intensity of band B, which are due\nto temperature fluctuations of about 0.5 K of the nozzle. At stagnation\ntemperature below 15 K large helium droplets are formed by fragmenta-\ntion from the liquid phase.33.\n7321 dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp2008489 |J. Phys. Chem. A 2011, 115, 7316\u20137326\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry A ARTICLE\npulse. Second, the total flux of helium through the nozzle is so large\nthat the beam is no longer optically thin. Furthermore, the large size\ngives rise for a much increased Mie scattering cross-section and this\ncross-section is further increased in the proximity of energy\nresonances. The reduced intensity observed for T = 7.3 K is\ntherefore a consequence of both strong scattering and strong\nabsorption at the boundary of the cluster beam. Both effects prevent\nthe full light intensity from entering the focus.\n3He Droplets. 3He droplets were produced at a stagnation\npressure of 7 bar and using the same 5 \u03bcm orifice as for 4He\ndroplets. The excitation spectra of 3He droplets are shown in\nFigures 5 and 6. Bound states of small 3He clusters do not exist\nand therefore clusters grow through fragmentation from the liquid\nphase rather than via condensation seeds produced in three-body\ncollisions. Clusters appear abruptly when the source is cooled below a\nthreshold temperature. Figure 5 shows, for a source temperature of 11\nK, only sharp atomic resonance lines, for 10.6 K strongly rugged\nbands, and for 10.2 K fully developed bands. The shape and the\nintensity of the spectral features remain constant when the source\ntemperature is further lowered to 9.0 K. Further lowering of the\ntemperature causes the features to distort and to lose intensity, similar\nto large 4He droplets that were produced by fragmentation from the\nliquid phase. Measurements of the droplet size by Harms et al. using\nthe cross beam deflection method reveal sizes that decrease slightly\nwith decreasing source temperature.11 If we take the large distortion\nand intensity loss as indicators of the presence of very large droplets,\nour spectra show rather the opposite.We have therefore indicated the\nsize only for source temperatures close to the onset of clustering\nwhere we believe the assignment by Harms et al. is reliable.\nThe spectral features of 3He droplets showmany similarities to\n4He: both bands A and B are observed, but with a different shift\nand width, as reported before.6 At higher energies differences to\n4He become larger, the 3s feature is weaker in intensity compared\nto the 3p atomic line and the overall intensity is weaker. Band E\nappears as a shoulder on the high energy side of the 4p line at\n23.67 eV Figure 5 and shows no sign of the distinct maximum\nthat is observed for 4He droplets in Figures 3 and 4.\nShort-Lived Fluorescence. Figures 7, 8, and 9 show the\nexcitation of short-lived fluorescence of 4He clusters and large\ndroplets. Comparison with the total-fluorescence-yield excita-\ntion spectra shows a number of differences relevant for our\ninterpretation. Band B, which evolves from a blue-shifted wing of\nthe 2p line already appears for clusters containing only N = 360\natoms with a distinct maximum (Figure 7). It is straightforward\nto assign band B to excitations in the volume region of helium\ndroplets where the density and the perturbation of atomic 2p\nlevels is greater than at the surface. Hence, the appearance of\nband B at sizes smaller than seen in the total fluorescence yield\nspectra in Figure 1 shows that the short-lived-fluorescence\nexcitation spectra are sensitive to excitations in the bulk region\nof droplets. This finding is consistent with a density-dependence\nof electronic decay and the following model: it is known that\nelectronically excited helium clusters desorb electronically ex-\ncited helium atoms and excimers in Rydberg states.5 This\ndesorption is detected through efficient fluorescence in the\nvisible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared spectral ranges that is caused\nby transitions between excited states of the atoms and excimers.5\nThe visible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared fluorescence is typically\nas intense as the VUV fluorescence emerging from transitions to\nthe ground state. Normally one would expect a much stronger\nVUV fluorescence because the Einstein coefficient of emission\nscales with the third power of the transition energy. The reason\nfor the high visible, ultraviolet, and near-infrared fluorescence\nefficiency is that the excitation energy is transferred to \u201cfree\u201d\nTable 2.

Reference 11 reports\ndecreasing droplet sizes with decreasing temperature. The features here\nshow no indication of such a trend. Bands A, B, and E are labeled. Band E\nappears between the 4p (23.7 eV) and 5p (24.0 eV) line as a shoulder\nand has no distinct maximum unlike for 4He droplets.\n7322 dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp2008489 |J. Phys. Chem. A 2011, 115, 7316\u20137326\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry A ARTICLE\natomic and excimer states from which a direct decay to the\nground state is dipole forbidden. This energy transfer is obviously\nmuch faster than the radiative lifetime of the VUV transitions\n(\u223c1 ns), indicating that the desorption efficiency is very high.\nFurthermore, the lines seen in the visible, ultraviolet, and near-\ninfrared fluorescence are unshifted with respect to free gas phase\natomic and excimer emissions.5 The high absence of any shift\nshows that the fluorescence occurs when the atoms and excimers\nhave already reached a great distance from the cluster\/droplet\nsurface, which provides further evidence that the desorption\nmust be much faster than the radiative lifetime.5,8 Before\nfluorescence is emitted, the electronic energy tends to relax\nquickly (on a time scale faster than the fluorescence lifetime) to\nthe lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). If an excita-\ntion was located at the cluster surface desorption of excited\nspecies is more likely to happen. Consequently, in highly\nelectronically excited helium droplets fast nonradiative relaxation\ncompetes with the desorption of highly excited Rydberg atoms\nand excimers and this competition depends on the location of the\nexcitation. It is therefore plausible that excitations at the surface\ndo not relax as much as they would if they were in the bulk-\nvolume and produce more likely fluorescence from desorbed\natoms and excimers in high-lying Rydberg states. Hence, the\nfluorescence lifetime is shorter for fully relaxed excitations in the\nvolume because on average the lifetime scales with the principal\nquantum number of the Rydberg states as n3.\nLong-Lived Fluorescence. The above interpretation is\nfurther corroborated by the intensities found for the long-lived\nfluorescence excitation shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12. For N =\n360, band B is not fully developed and shows no distinct\nmaximum; instead, the spectrum shows a wing more character-\nistic for regions of lower and strongly varying density character-\nistic for the surface region. The shape of band B is similar to that\nFigure 6. Fluorescence excitation spectra of 3He droplets. Band A\n(20.89 eV) is more separated from band B (21.4 eV) than for 4He\ndroplet, which we interpret as being due to the lower density of liquid\n3He and the absence of contributions from small clusters. At stagnation\ntemperatures lower than 8 K the feature at 21.4 (band B) begins to\ndistort, indicating the formation of very large droplets.\nFigure 7. Excitation spectra of the short-lived fluorescence of 4He\ndroplets. A maximum of band B (\u223c21.39 eV) can is observed for N =\n360, indicating that the short-lived fluorescence excitation spectra is\nsensitive to excitations in the volume.\nFigure 8.

Between the 2p atomic line (21.22 eV) and band B (21.57 eV)\none observes a gap that is filled in the long-lived fluorescence excitation\nspectra in Figure 12. The width of band B ofN = 1800 clusters is 0.49 eV.\n7323 dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp2008489 |J. Phys. Chem.

Obviously, the long-lived fluorescence excitation\nspectra are sensitive to surface excitations and show, as we would\nexpect, trends opposite to what we observe for the short-lived\nfluorescence.\nFeatures at Higher Energy (n > 3). In the following we\ndiscuss the features at higher energy. Here, the assignment is less\nclear than for the 2s- and 2p-related bands A and B, with the\nexception of the sharp lines, which are clearly related to helium\natoms and are due to free or nearly free atoms in the molecular\nbeam, small clusters, and loosely bound atoms at the surface,\nrespectively. Separate bands are difficult to identify, as theoretical\npredictions of the nature of the high-lying bands do not exist.\nHowever, if we compare the long-lived fluorescence spectra in\nFigures 10\u000112 with the short-lived fluorescence spectra in\nFigures 7\u00019, we notice that the intensities of the features at\nhigher energies close to the atomic ionization threshold show a\nclear dependence on the fluorescence lifetime. As the long-lived\nfluorescence spectra are more intense, we anticipate that the\nhigh-lying features are related to surface excitations. With\nincreasing droplet size, the number of atoms in the volume\nincreases faster than the number of atoms on the surface and one\nwould expect that the intensities related to surface excitation\ndecreases with respect to volume excitation. To further investigate\nthe anticipated surface character of the high-energy excitations, we\nFigure 9. Excitation spectra of the short-lived fluorescence of large 4He\ndroplets.\nFigure 10. Excitation spectra of the long-lived fluorescence of 4He\ndroplets. The long-lived fluorescence is sensitive to regions of reduced\ndensity, that is, the surface of large droplets or small helium clusters (see\ntext).\nFigure 11. Excitation spectra of the long-lived fluorescence of 4He\ndroplets. Compared with the short-lived fluorescence excitation spectra\nbands A and B are less distinct. The width of band B ofN = 1800 clusters\nis 0.53 eV, which is significantly larger than what is seen in the short-lived\nfluorescence spectra (Figure 8). The gap between 2p atomic line and\nband B is filled, indicating contributions from low-density regions, that\nis, small clusters or atoms in the surface region. The opposite is observed\nfor themaximumof band Ewhich appears more distinct in the long-lived\nspectra (see text).\n7324 dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp2008489 |J. Phys. Chem. A 2011, 115, 7316\u20137326\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry A ARTICLE\nlook in the following at the droplet size-dependence of the\nintensities. We focus on band E because this is the only feature at\nhigh energies for which a distinct maximum can be identified.\nHowever, the distinct maximum is only observed in the spectra of\n4He droplets (Figures 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, and 12), but absent for 3He\ndroplets (Figures 5 and 6). The evaluation of intensities is a difficult\ntask and requires exceptional control of all experimental parameters.\nIn our experiment, the droplet size is changed by changing the\ntemperature of the source. Lowering the source temperature is\naccompanied by a flux increase; therefore, comparing intensities of\nspectra of different droplet sizes requires normalization, which is a\nprocedure highly sensitive to errors. We have therefore investigated\nthe ratio between the long-lived and the short-lived fluorescence of\nthe maximum intensity of band E. Considering the ratio between\nlong-lived and short-lived fluorescence eliminates the difficulties\nassociated with normalization to the overall intensity because its\ncontribution is canceled out. The result is shown in Figure 13. If the\nratio between long-lived and short-lived fluorescence were due to\nvolume excitation one would expect a constant line. For band E the\nintensity ratio shows a remarkably good fit to a N\u00011\/3 dependence\ngiving strong evidence of an excitation that is located in the surface\nregion of helium droplets. For comparison we have shown the long-\nlived and short-lived fluorescence ratio for band B. This ratio is much\nsmaller than for band E, which does not surprise given that there is\nample evidence for a bulk-volume nature of band B. Also, the ratio\ndoes not fit as well to N\u00011\/3 dependence as for band E.\nAs all other spectral features above 23 eV show higher\nintensities in the long-lived fluorescence spectra we anticipate\nthat they are likewise due to excitations at the surface. In\nparticular, we anticipate perturbed atomic states, of which some\nhave previously been identified as 3s, 3d, and 3p.6 We see now\nevidence that these states reside within the surface layer. We\ntentatively assign band E to an n = 4 related excitation, but further\nevidence is required. The lack of intensity of high-lying excita-\ntions located in the bulk volume is consistent with the spectral\nfeatures recorded using a solar-blind photomultiplier, as reported\nearlier.8 The solar-blind multiplier is sensitive to fluorescence\noriginating from the bulk-volume region and the spectrum\nreported shows many similarities with the short-lived fluores-\ncence excitation spectrum, the features above 23 eV being even\nweaker. We interpret this result such that in bulk liquid helium\nFigure 12. Excitation spectra of the long-lived fluorescence of 4He\ndroplets.\nFigure 13.

The same ratio is shown for band B for comparison.\nThe straight dash-dotted line shows a N\u00011\/3 dependence as would be\nexpected for an excitation located at the surface. Probing excitations\nlocated in the volume would show a constant line. The ratio between the\nlong-lived and short-lived fluorescence is much higher for band E than\nfor band B, indicating the surface location of the excitations.\nFigure 14.

A 2011, 115, 7316\u20137326\nThe Journal of Physical Chemistry A ARTICLE\nRydberg states higher than n = 2 are destabilized due to the Pauli\nrepulsion and the low polarizability of bulk liquid helium. A set of\northogonal states extending beyond the average internuclear\nseparation are therefore difficult, if not impossible to construct\nin an infinite, disordered system like bulk liquid helium, but likely\nto exist at the surface of liquid helium and helium droplets. For\nsmall helium clusters high Rydberg states may exist because they\nexpand beyond the entire cluster.\nIt is interesting to compare this finding with the long-lived\/\nshort-lived intensity ratio found for 3He droplets (see\nFigures 14\u000117). As spectra of small 3He clusters are not available\nthe size dependence cannot be investigated. However, 3He dro-\nplets provide a convenient benchmark for density effects. We\nobserve higher intensities of the bands at energies higher than 23\neV compared to the intensity of band B than for the total fluores-\ncence (Figure 3) and the short-lived fluorescence excitation\nspectra (Figure 9). The spectral region of band E shows no\ndistinct maximum as for 4He droplets other than a wing decreas-\ning in intensity. We interpret this wing as due to the perturbation\nin the surface region being even lower for 3He droplets than for\n4He droplets. At 23.78 eV, just above the 4p line the long-lived\/\nshort-lived fluorescence ratio, being indicative for features lo-\ncated in low-density regions, is two, which is similar to that of the\nsmall and medium sized 4He clusters in Figure 13.\nThe fact that the maximum of band E appears for 4He clusters\nlarger than N = 450 and that 3He droplets only exhibit a blue-\nshifted wing shows that a minimum density is required to\nproduce band E. We therefore conclude that the excitation is\nburied within the surface layer. This is supported by the observed\nenergy shift shown in Table 1. Different to band B, where the\nshift saturates at N = 1200, the shift continues up to N = 9200.\nSuch a behavior is expected for an extended electronic wave\nfunction with n g 3, which is perturbed by dense helium. If the\nexcitation was located in the outer surface region both excited\nstate electron density and ground state electron density of the\nperturbing atoms do not have sufficient overlap to produce\nnotable perturbation.9\nIn conclusion, we have presented fluorescence excitation\nspectra of 3He and 4He clusters and droplets over a large size\nFigure 15. Excitation spectra of the short-lived fluorescence of 3He\ndroplets.\nFigure 16. Excitation spectra of the long-lived fluorescence of 3He\ndroplets. We observe higher intensities of the bands at energies higher\nthan 23 eV compared to the intensity of band B than for short-lived\nfluorescence excitation spectra. This shows that the \u201chigh-energy\u201d bands\ncorrespond to regions of lower density, that is, atoms in the surface layer.\nContributions of small clusters can be excluded for 3He droplet beams\n(see text).\nFigure 17. Excitation spectra of the long-lived fluorescence of 3He\ndroplets. Band A (20.89 eV) is more separate from band B than observed\nfor the short-lived fluorescence excitation spectra of 3He droplets. This\nshows that it is possible to selectively probe regions of reduced density\nby measuring the long-lived fluorescence yield.\n7326 dx.doi.org\/10.1021\/jp2008489 |J. Phys. Chem.

The fluorescence excitation was recorded in \u201ctime-win-\ndows\u201d specific to short-lived and long-lived fluorescence allowing\nus to better assign the spectral features. We analyze spectral shifts\nwith respect to atomic resonance lines and identify excitations\nlocated in regions of weak and strong perturbation, that is, surface\nstates and bulk-volume states, respectively. We show that short-\nlived fluorescence is sensitive to regions of large perturbation,\nthat is, wave functions with high electron density in regions of\nincreased density, that is, excitations in the bulk region of large\ndroplets, whereas long-lived fluorescence is sensitive to small\nclusters or the surface region. The observed size dependence of\nshort-lived and long-lived fluorescence shows unambiguously a\nlocation of high-lying features within the surface region. This\npoints toward quenching of high-lying electronic states in liquid\nhelium, a possible reason being that the perturbation due to Pauli\nrepulsion is too strong and the polarizability too low to build up\northogonal wave functions. Hence, most of the oscillator\nstrength in bulk liquid helium is concentrated in the 2s and 2p\nexcitations, while at the surface of helium droplets and in small\nhelium clusters high-lying Rydberg states exist.\n\u2019AUTHOR INFORMATION\nCorresponding Author\n*E-mail: kvh6@le.ac.uk.\n\u2019ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nWe are grateful to Mark Watkins for critically reading the\nmanuscript.\n\u2019REFERENCES\n(1) W\u20acormer, J.; Joppien,M.; Zimmerer, G.;M\u20acoller, T.
