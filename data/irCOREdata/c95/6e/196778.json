The corresponding enhancement predicted by our simulations is 10\u201320%. With such small increases in LUE, our site will not assimilate more carbon on overcast days compared to seasonally equivalent sunny days; (2) the scale-up in photosynthesis from top-leaf to canopy is less than unity. The Big Leaf approximation, based on Beer's law and light-acclimated leaf nitrogen, overpredicts this scale-up by \u226560% for low sky radiance (\u2264500 \u03bcmolPAR m\u22122 s\u22121); (3) when leaf nitrogen is distributed so as to maximize canopy photosynthesis, the increase in the canopy carbon assimilation, compared with a uniform nitrogen distribution, is small (\u22454%). Maximum assimilation occurs when the vertical gradient of leaf nitrogen is slightly shallower than that of the light profile.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n2011-01-18T14:10:54Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2011-01-18T14:10:54Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2005-12-08<\/dc:date><dc:type>\nArticle<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>\nJournal of Geophysical Research, 2005, 110, D23209.<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n0148-0227<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\nhttp:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1029\/2005JD006060\/abstract<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\nhttp:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2381\/8980<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n10.1029\/2005JD006060<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>\nen<\/dc:language><dc:rights>\nThis paper was published as Journal of Geophysical Research, 2005, 110, D23209.

Introduction\n[2] Downwelling, shortwave (l = 0.4\u20132 mm; hereafter\nSW) radiation is one of the principle driving variables in\nland-surface schemes coupled to climate and dynamic\nvegetation models. It has a major influence on surface\ntemperature (thus microbial and plant respiration), energy\nbudget (including exchanges of sensible and latent heat),\nand carbon uptake and release. Indeed, in the context of the\ncarbon cycle, it might be argued that our representation of\nradiative transfer (RT) must predict photosynthesis to an\naccuracy of better than 10% if we are to monitor terrestrial\nvegetation and its response to changing atmospheric carbon\n(anthropogenically introduced carbon is currently estimated\nat 0.1 global net primary production (NPP); see also Knorr\nand Heimann [2001]; Adams and Piovesan [2002] for a\ndiscussion).\n[3] Simple RT schemes are not computationally expen-\nsive. On these grounds the light representation implemented\nin land-surface schemes such as MOSES [Cox et al., 2000;\nCox et al., 1998] and SiB2 [Denning et al., 2003] bases\nitself on the Big Leaf approximation for the calculation of\ncanopy photosynthesis. Here, sunlight is treated as a\ndirect beam decreasing exponentially with depth through\nthe canopy according to Beer\u2019s Law. Canopy assimilation\nis assumed to be a scalar multiplication of the leaf\nphotosynthetic rate. As we show in this paper, leaves\nsituated at the same depth in the canopy are subject to a\nwidely varying range of Photosynthetically Active Radi-\nation (PAR). This, combined with the highly nonlinear\nleaf response to light, necessitates a more rigorous\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 110, D23209, doi:10.1029\/2005JD006060, 2005\nCopyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/05\/2005JD006060$09.00\nD23209 1 of 13\ncalculation of leaf irradiance for foliage possessing dif-\nferent orientations and locations within the canopy. The\nnew generation of multilevel and sunlit-shaded models\naccounts, to some extent, for this dispersion in irradiance\nby estimating the fraction of both light-limited and light-\nsaturated foliage before scaling up from leaf to canopy\nlevel [Medlyn et al., 2003; de Pury and Farquhar, 1997].\nA second problem with the Big Leaf paradigm is that\nactive leaf nitrogen is assumed to decline with depth\nthrough the canopy in the same way as light extinction.\nField measurements for a wide range of canopies indicate\nthat the vertical falloff is much shallower [Lewis et al.,\n2000; Meir et al., 2002].\n[4] Many land surface schemes fail to represent suffi-\nciently well the directionality of incoming sky radiation, in\nparticular its diffuse component (e.g., the LPG model)\n[Sitch et al., 2003]. Diffuse sunlight is likely to be important\nwhen aerosol loading or cloud cover is high. Compared to\ndirect sunlight, diffuse PAR is expected to expose a greater\nfraction of the foliage to moderate irradiances rather than\nleaving parts of the canopy in intense sunlight or deep shade\n[Farquhar and Roderick, 2003]. An increase of 50\u2013100%\nin light-use efficiency (LUE) has been claimed for some\ntree canopies when cloud cover is high [Hollinger et al.,\n1994; Gu et al., 2002; Niyogi et al., 2004]. Thus the\npurported 5\u201310% \u2018\u2018dimming\u2019\u2019 of SW radiation at the land\nsurface during the last 40 years, attributed to increased\naerosol loading and thickening cloud cover [Stanhill and\nCohen, 2001; Liepert, 2002], may be offset, in terms of\nphotosynthesis, by a more efficient carbon uptake under\ndiffuse sky radiation. In contrast to clouds, aerosols are\nexpected to increase diffuse sunlight with relatively little\nreduction in total sky radiance [Roderick et al., 2001]. Gu\net al. [2003] claim a 20% increase in the NPP of an\nAmerican broadleaf forest following the aerosol outgassing\nassociated with the Pinatubo volcanic eruption. However,\ntree ring widths for the last 600 years indicate a lowering\nof global or hemispherical NPP, due to subdued surface\ntemperatures, in the wake of violent volcanic eruptions\n[Briffa et al., 1998]. Finally, one might conjecture that the\nrather symmetric distribution and orientation of leaves\nrelative to the solar azimuth [Falster and Westoby,\n2003], particularly for deciduous trees located in the\nmidlatitudes, demonstrates the influence of diffuse sky\nradiance on plant light acclimation. Diffuse light is largely\nisotropic and thus best captured by an azimuthally sym-\nmetric foliage.\n[5] This paper has three main aims: (1) to determine the\nextent to which canopy carbon assimilation is more efficient\nunder diffuse sky radiance, (2) to calculate rigorously the\nscale-up of carbon assimilation from leaf to canopy level\nand compare our results with simple RT schemes such as the\nBig Leaf approximation, and (3) to determine the vertical\ndistribution of leaf nitrogen which maximizes assimilation\nwithin the canopy. To realize our objectives we have taken\nthe novel and crucial step of incorporating a colimited leaf\nphotosynthesis model into a three-dimensional, numerical,\nray-tracing simulation. The enhanced RT model allows\npredictions of carbon assimilation when the canopy is\nsubject to both direct and diffuse sunlight. It has been\nhypothesized that diffuse radiation, acting in concert with\na heterogenous canopy architecture, increases substantially\nthe LUE of the system compared to pure direct sunlight\n[Gu et al., 2002]. We test this hypothesis, using our\nthree-dimensional simulations, for a Siberian pine forest\nwhere carbon exchange has been measured extensively.\nThis paper is structured as follows. The next two sections\ndescribe the expansion of the RT scheme to calculate\nphotosynthesis in 3-D canopies. In section 2 we describe\nthe measurements of carbon flux and diffuse light\nobtained at the test site. In section 3 we compare our\nsimulations against the observations. In section 4 we\ndiscuss the three main themes outlined above: diffuse\nlight, scale-up, and optimal assimilation. Our conclusions\nare summarized in section 5.\n2. Methods and Observational Data\n2.1. Radiative Transfer Modeling\n[6] The Forest LIGHT Interaction Model (FLIGHT) is\na Monte Carlo numerical simulation of optical and near-\ninfrared photons propagating through either a one-\ndimensional (1-D) homogeneous or 3-D heterogeneous\nleaf canopy [North, 1996]. For 3-D simulations, tree\ncrowns are represented by geometric primitives (ellipses\nand cones) with a range of prescribed dimensions (e.g.,\nradius and height). In all cases, foliage is represented by\nvolume-averaged parameters such as leaf area index\n(LAI), leaf-angle distribution (LAD), and scattering phase\nfunction. FLIGHT operates in two modes: \u2018\u2018forward\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018reverse.\u2019\u2019 In forward mode, photons are traced as they\nenter the top of the canopy, scatter off the ground and\/or\ncanopy foliage, and then are either absorbed or escape to\nthe sky. By monitoring where light is absorbed and\nwhere it emerges from the forest it is possible to\nascertain such quantities as the fraction of absorbed\nPAR and the bidirectional reflectance function of the\nsurface.\n[7] The reverse mode is more recent, although it has been\nused to estimate the LUE in 1-D canopies [Barton and\nNorth, 2001]. It estimates irradiances on leaf surfaces using\nMonte Carlo sampling, and we have expanded this tech-\nnique here in order to treat 3-D canopies. A technical\ndescription and validation of the reverse mode is presented\nelsewhere (P. North et al., Sampling of leaf irradiances using\nthe three-dimensional forest light interaction model\nFLIGHT, manuscript in preparation, 2005), although we\nsummarize the salient points here. Random locations within\nthe canopy are chosen as representative of leaf positions.\nLikewise, leaf orientations are statistically selected accord-\ning to the LAD. Irradiances on the leaf surface are estimated\nas the sum of two components: First, a \u2018\u2018direct\u2019\u2019 beam\nemanating from the solar disk and, second, a \u2018\u2018diffuse\u2019\u2019\nbeam composed of (1) light reflected from surrounding\nfoliage, (2) light scattered from the ground, and (3) diffuse\nradiation emanating from the sky. At the beginning of the\nsimulation, the sky radiation field is prescribed fractions of\ndirect and diffuse sunlight. For any given leaf, the degree of\nillumination by direct and diffuse light follows from reverse\nray tracing. For the direct component the ray path is\nfollowed backward through the canopy toward the solar\nposition. The optical depth to the top of the canopy\ndetermines the probability of illumination by the Sun and\nthence the magnitude of direct light normal to the leaf\nD23209 ALTON ET AL.: RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A PINE FOREST\n2 of 13\nD23209\nsurface. For the diffuse component a number of random\ndirections is selected and each ray path is followed back to\nits next point of interaction (the ground, the sky, or another\nleaf) in order to determine the irradiance arising from that\nparticular direction. This is carried out recursively until the\nray paths are traced back to the sky. Monte Carlo reverse\ntracing has been applied successfully to a range of canopy\nrepresentations in the past and is fairly well established\n[Dawson et al., 1999; Goel and Thompson, 2000; Disney et\nal., 2000]. The canopy angular reflectance, as well as the\nprofile of light absorption through the canopy, are consistent\nacross reverse and forward modes. The forward mode\npredicts values of albedo and reflectance which agree\nclosely with both measurements obtained in the field\n[North, 1996] and the predictions from other RT models\n[Pinty et al., 2004].\n[8] FLIGHT possesses two main advantages over simpler\nRT schemes based on, for example, Beer\u2019s Law or the Big\nLeaf approximation. First, we estimate much more rigor-\nously the irradiance on any given leaf according to its\nposition in the canopy and its particular orientation. Second,\nby subsequently determining the photosynthetic rate for any\ngiven leaf (see below), we can accurately scale up from leaf\nlevel to canopy-wide photosynthesis. Figure 1 depicts the\nleaf irradiances derived from the reverse mode in FLIGHT\nand compares them with the mean light attenuation pre-\ndicted by Beer\u2019s law. At any height within the canopy the\nleaf irradiances are well dispersed with respect to the mean\n(mainly due to sunlit foliage). It is precisely this dispersion,\nin conjunction with the highly nonlinear response of leaves\nto incident PAR, that necessitates a rigorous determination\nof leaf irradiance at different positions within the canopy in\norder to integrate successfully from leaf to canopy level\nphotosynthesis.\n2.2. Leaf Photosynthesis Model\n[9] FLIGHT provides an estimate of PAR at the leaf\nsurface for different positions within the canopy. In order to\ndetermine leaf photosynthetic rate from incident PAR we\nhave implemented a colimitation model for C3 leaf photo-\nsynthesis. This is the Farquhar et al. [1980] model as\nextended by Collatz et al. [1991]. The C3 colimitation\nmodel, once calibrated against observed physiological\nparameters, has been shown to be a robust predictor of\ncanopy photosynthesis for North American deciduous\nwoodland [Harley and Baldocchi, 1995]. We refer to\nAppendix A for the precise formulae governing the model\nand summarize here the main functional dependencies only.\nLeaf photosynthetic rate Al (mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031) is determined as\nthe smoothed minimum of three limiting quantities: the\nphotosynthetic rate due to incident PAR normal to the leaf,\nJPAR; the photosynthetic capacity due to the concentration\nand chemical activity of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carbox-\nylase\/oxygenase, i.e., Rubisco, Jr; and the photosynthetic\nrate limited by the ability of the plant to export the products\nof photosynthesis out of the leaf, Je. These quantities\ndepend on physiological leaf properties and environmental\nconditions in the following way:\nJPAR \u00bc f a;Ci; IPAR\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere the CO2 concentration inside the leaf, Ci (mol mol\n\u00031)\ndepends on the ambient CO2 concentration (mol mol\n\u00031),\nleaf temperature Tl (K), and the stomatal conductance (see\nFigure 1. The irradiances of leaf facets, sampled randomly in a one-dimensional (1-D), homogeneous\ncanopy of LAI = 3.0 m2m\u00032, as predicted from the FLIGHT simulation. Solid circles denote foliage\nwhich is sunlit while open squares signify shaded leaves receiving scattered radiation only. A spherical\nLAD has been assumed (i.e., an equal number of leaf normals populating each solid angle of a\nhemisphere). Sunlight incident at the top of the canopy is direct only (2000 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031 in the\nhorizontal plane) and emanates from an overhead Sun. The dotted and solid lines trace the mean leaf\nirradiance according to Beer\u2019s Law and the FLIGHT simulation, respectively. The latter is slightly higher\ndue to the treatment of scattered radiation as well as direct sunlight.\nD23209 ALTON ET AL.: RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A PINE FOREST\n3 of 13\nD23209\nbelow). IPAR (mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031) is the PAR irradiance normal\nto the leaf surface. The quantum efficiency a (mol mol\u00031) is\na physiological constant determining LUE in the light-linear\n(low IPAR) regime. Under normal circumstances, and\ncertainly during this study, the largest variation in JPAR\narise due to variations in IPAR.\nJr \u00bc f Vcmax;Tl;Ci;Oa\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere Oa (mol mol\n\u00031) is the ambient oxygen concentration\nand Vcmax is a physiological constant related to the\nconcentration of Rubisco in the leaves (see below). During\nthis study, 90% of the variation exhibited in Jr was due to\nchanges in Tl.\n[10] Finally, we note that Je = f(Vcmax, Tl) but, for the\nsimulations carried out in this work, the export limit was\nseldom reached. In general, the system passes from a light-\nlinear to a Rubisco-limited regime as IPAR increases. We\nemploy a quadratic function, with colimitation parameters\nclose to 0.9, to facilitate a smooth transition from one\nlimiting rate to another. From Al we subtract a leaf respira-\ntion (<0.5 mmol m\u00032s\u00031) which depends on Vcmax and Tl\n(see Appendix A).\n[11] The stomatal conductance imposes a further constraint\non the rate of photosynthesis and is inferred from the\nmeasured canopy transpiration. For carbon flow we can write\nAc \u00bc gc Ca \u0003 Ci\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere Ac (mmol m\n\u00032s\u00031) is the net photosynthetic rate for\nthe canopy, Ca (mol mol\n\u00031) is the ambient CO2 concentra-\ntion and gc (mmol m\n\u00032s\u00031) constitutes the total canopy\nconductance to CO2 (stomata, boundary layer, and\naerodynamic flow). Similarly, for water flow we can write\nE \u00bc gv D\nP\n; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere E (mmol m\u00032s\u00031) is the canopy transpiration rate, P\n(Pa) is ambient air pressure, D (Pa) is the water vapor deficit\nand gv (mmol m\n\u00032s\u00031) is the total canopy conductance to\nwater vapor. For the two relations (3) and (4) we have made\nthe (necessary) simplification that at any given moment, all\nleaves within the canopy possess the same internal CO2\nconcentration and the same temperature. The latter is\napproximated by the measured air temperature (T). For open\nforest with stomata closing down, total canopy conductance\nis likely to be dominated by the stomatal term. Thus gv =\n1.6gc and relations (3) and (4) combine to yield [e.g.,\nCampbell and Norman, 1998]\nAc \u2019 P\n1:6\nE\nD\nCa \u0003 Ci\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f05\u00de\nNote that when aerodynamic or boundary-layer resistance\ndominates gv = 1.4gc [Sellers et al., 1996].\n[12] The canopy rate of photosynthesis can now be solved\nby iteration. Our FLIGHT model provides estimates of\nirradiance at the leaf level (IPAR) for an observed downwel-\nling sky radiance I0 expressed as top-of-canopy PAR\nmeasured in the horizontal plane (mmol m\u00032 s\u00031). This,\ncombined with measured air temperature and air pressure,\nallows us to estimate Al via equations (1) and (2). Through\nrepeated sampling and integration in the FLIGHT simula-\ntion, we obtain Ac. Canopy photosynthesis must, in turn, be\nconsistent with the observed canopy transpiration rate and\nthe observed water vapor deficit. Thus inferred Ac is\nsubstituted into equation (5) to isolate Ci, itself a prerequi-\nsite for the calculation of Al. Equations (1), (2), and (5) are\nsolved iteratively until Ci and Ac converge.\n[13] In summary, the leaf photosynthesis model is driven\nprimarily by sky radiance and air temperature. Stomatal\nconductance is inferred from measured values of canopy\ntranspiration and air vapor deficit. Two physiological con-\nstants, a and Vcmax, determine the leaf response to temper-\nature and light. They are prescribed values from field\ncampaigns or data in the literature. Soil moisture is only\naccounted for indirectly in our simulations. Low water\npotential will reduce measured transpiration inducing sto-\nmatal closure in equation (5).\n2.3. Observational Data\n2.3.1. Carbon Fluxes\n[14] Our simulations of canopy photosynthesis were test-\ned against measurements of carbon flux recorded during\nJune, July, and August of 1999 and 2000 (hereafter JJA\nperiod) for a 200 year-old Siberian stand of monotypic\nScots Pine. Wirth et al. [1999] designate the site 200ld and\nwe refer to it simply as \u2018\u2018Zotino\u2019\u2019 hereafter. Lloyd et al.\n[2002] have already presented hourly estimates of net CO2\nassimilation for Zotino during 1999 and 2000. Here we\nanalyze these data, for the first time, in the context of\ndiffuse light and interpret the canopy response by means of\nRT modeling. Zotino is an open stand of 470 trees\/ha\nwith only 60% of the ground directly below tree crowns\n[Wirth et al., 1999]. Needles harvested from the site and\nanalyzed with a LICOR light cuvette indicate an LAI as low\nas 1.3 m2 m\u00032 for the site [Wirth et al., 1999]. Los et al.\n[2000] estimate LAI = 3.5 m2 m\u00032 for the 80 km square\ncontaining Zotino using reflectances detected by\nthe AVHRR satellite. Although the latter measurement\nencompasses an area ten times larger than the pine stand\nitself, we have obtained MODIS data which indicate that the\nreflectances of the 0.5 km square containing Zotino are\ntypical of the 80 km square as a whole. Given its importance\nin our simulations, we have adopted minimum and\nmaximum values for the LAI characterizing the Zotino site\n(1.3 m2 m\u00032 and 3.5, respectively). Table 1 summarizes the\nmain geographical features of the pine stand.\n[15] Zotino forms part of the EUROSIBERIAN\nCARBOFLUX network. A flux tower provides estimates of\nCO2 and energy exchange between the stand and the above-\ncanopy airspace with a \u2018\u2018footprint\u2019\u2019 of \u00011 km2. The same\ninstallation records micrometeorology (above-canopy\ntemperature, pressure, humidity, and the downwelling\nradiances of SW, PAR, and thermal radiation). We follow\nLloyd et al. [2002] in estimating canopy photosynthetic\nrate, Ac as follows:\nAc \u00bc Cbot \u0003 Ctop \u0003 DCstore \u00fe 0:85\t Rst\u00f0 \u00de; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere Ctop (mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031) and Cbot (mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031) are the\ncarbon fluxes at the top and bottom eddy-covariance device,\nrespectively, and DCstore (mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031) is the rate of\nD23209 ALTON ET AL.: RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A PINE FOREST\n4 of 13\nD23209\nchange in CO2 concentration in the canopy airspace be-\ntween the two devices (DCstore is provided by gas profile\nmeasurements). The trunk respiration Rst is estimated at 0.3\nand 0.4 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031 for 1999 and 2000, respectively\n[Shibistova et al., 2002]. We follow previous authors in\ndesignating skyward carbon flow as positive, although,\nwhen quantifying photosynthesis and respiration, we dis-\ncuss them in terms of their magnitude.\n2.3.2. Diffuse Light\n[16] The fraction of diffuse downwelling shortwave radi-\nation (fDIF) has been measured at a bog 1.5 km from the\nZotino flux tower for nearly all the JJA period in 1999 and\nonly half the JJA period in 2000. When fDIF was not\navailable we inferred its value by comparing the observed\nshortwave radiation, SWobs, with its anticipated clear-sky\nvalue, SWcl. The latter can be calculated from the solar\nposition and simple empirical relationships given by, for\nexample, Campbell and Norman [1998] for clear-sky opac-\nity. We have defined a \u2018\u2018cloud factor,\u2019\u2019 1-SWobs\/SWcl,\nindicating the level of direct sunlight obscured by clouds.\nFigure 2 reveals a positive correlation between fDIF and the\ncloud factor except when the latter exceeds 0.6 and the\ndiffuse fraction begins to saturate. A very similar relation-\nship has been found for sites globally by Roderick et al.\n[2001]. For the purposes of this study, we divide Zotino\ncarbon fluxes into measurements collected under direct\n(fDIF < 0.5) and diffuse (fDIF \u0002 0.5) sky radiance. Where\nfDIF has not been measured, we use a cloud factor threshold\nof 0.3 to separate diffuse and direct samples. With the cloud\nfactor \u0002 0.3, fDIF \u0002 0.5 for 92% of the points in Figure 2\nand, similarly, 91% of the points with cloud factor <0.3\npossess fDIF < 0.5. Comparing SWobs with maximum\nFigure 2. The observed fraction of diffuse downwelling shortwave radiation, fDIF, against the inferred\ncloud cover at Zotino during the growing seasons of 1998, 1999, and 2000 (May\u2013September, inclusive).\nThe quantity fDIF was measured close to the forest stand and has been integrated over hourly intervals.\nThe cloud factor constitutes the fractional deficit in downwelling shortwave radiation. SWobs and SWcl\ndenote the observed and anticipated clear-sky shortwave radiation, respectively. Note that the cloud factor\ncan become negative when clouds are present to reflect light to the ground but the solar disk remains\nunobscured.\nTable 1.

The satellite-derived LAI is inferred from the Normalized\nDifference Vegetation Index [Los et al., 2000].\nD23209 ALTON ET AL.: RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A PINE FOREST\n5 of 13\nD23209\nvalues recorded over 15 day composites indicates that\nthe cloud factor, as we have defined it, works rather\nwell in estimating obscuration of the Sun (uncertainty\n10%).\n[17] We shall test the hypothesis that canopies assimilate\nmore carbon under diffuse light compared to direct sunlight.\nTo do this, we must compare photosynthetic rate under\nsimilar conditions of temperature, canopy humidity and,\nabove all, under equal sky radiance (I0). Since increased\nfDIF is usually accompanied by lower levels of direct\nshortwave radiation (Figure 2), to enable a comparison at\na given value of I0, the Sun will generally be higher in the\nsky for high fDIF measurements compared to the low fDIF\ncategory. One notable consequence of this was that our low\nfDIF (clear sky) sample initially contained a preponderance\nof measurements from early June and late August (when\nsolar elevations are lower). Since highest photosynthetic\nrates are attained in late July and remain constant for August\n[Lloyd et al., 2002], we felt it necessary to remove any bias\ntowards measurements collected early in the JJA period.\nThus for each fDIF category we have randomly sampled the\ndata to ensure an even distribution of measurements\nthroughout the JJA period. Note that we have limited the\ncurrent analysis to the midsummer months since photosyn-\nthesis appears to be physiologically impaired for dates close\nto the spring thaw and the first autumn frosts [Lloyd et al.,\n2002]. Furthermore, measurements of carbon exchange\nwere only used if the solar elevation angle was greater than\n18\u0004 and the air temperature lay between 281 and 293 K.\nEliminating high temperature measurements mitigates the\ninfluence of stomatal closure on canopy photosynthetic\nresponse.\n2.4. Configuring the Simulation for Zotino\n[18] Our simulations are driven by observed values of air\ntemperature and sky radiance with measured transpiration\nand water vapor deficit constraining stomatal closure. Dif-\nfuse sky radiance is assumed to be perfectly isotropic and\nthe solar zenith angle of the direct sky component follows\nfrom the date and time of day. Table 2 shows the mean\nvalues of the environmental driving variables for 1999.\nHourly carbon and meteorological measurements have been\nseparated according to the sky radiation field (fDIF < 0.5\nand fDIF \u0002 0.5) and then averaged into I0 bins. An RT\nsimulation is run for each I0 bin using the corresponding\nmean values of temperature, I0, qs, vapor deficit, and\ntranspiration rate. Table 2 indicates that the mean fDIF is\nclose to 0.25 and 0.75 for the diffuse and direct sky radiance\ncategories, respectively, as we have defined them above\n(fDIF < 0.5 and fDIF \u0002 0.5). Thus initially our simulations\nare conducted pairwise with fDIF = 0.25 and fDIF = 0.75\n(hereafter, simply referred to as \u2018\u2018direct\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018diffuse\u2019\u2019\nsimulations, respectively).\n[19] Our leaf photosynthesis model requires us to set two\nphysiological constants: the quantum efficiency, a, and the\ncapacity due to Rubisco, Vcmax. The latter scales with the\nactive [Stitt and Schulze, 1994] concentration of leaf nitro-\ngen. In the absence of values in the literature for Scots Pine\nwe have calibrated a and Vcmax from measurements of leaf\ngas exchange conducted for top leaves of Canadian Jack\nPine Pinus banksiana obtained independently during the\nBoreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) [Gamon\net al., 2004]. A least-squares fit for Vcmax yielded 56 \u00b1\n2 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031 (Figure 3). Similarly, a was derived as\n0.030 \u00b1 0.005 mol mol\u00031, i.e., toward the lower end of\nvalues cited for tree species (0.025\u20130.075) [Dang et al.,\n1998; Lewis et al., 2000; Singsaas et al., 2001]. We allow\nfor the slightly higher leaf nitrogen measured at Zotino\n(3.20 gNm\u00032) [Wirth et al., 2002] compared to the Canadian\nsite (2.75 gNm\u00032 assuming cylindrical pine needles) [Dang\net al., 1997] and thus set Vcmax to 65 mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031 at the top\nof the canopy in the simulation.\n[20] FLIGHT calculates photosynthesis at the leaf level\nbefore scaling up to canopy level. This allows us to ascribe\na depth-dependent value for Vcmax.

Neither kext nor krub has been measured for Zotino\nbut the RT simulations we conduct below imply kext \u2019 0.75\nfor a site of this latitude. The Big Leaf approximation\nassumes krub = kext which purportedly maximizes the value\nof canopy photosynthesis for a given total of leaf nitrogen\n[e.g., Schulze et al., 1994] and simplifies its calculation in\nthe land-surface scheme. Field measurements, however,\nindicate that light acclimation is incomplete with Rubisco\ndeclining as krub \u2019 kext\/3 for a range of tree canopies [Lewis\net al., 2000; Meir et al., 2002]. Initially, we assume krub =\n0.75\/3 = 0.25 but we undertake to run a \u2018\u2018light-acclimated\nscenario\u2019\u2019 where krub = 0.75. Note that for both krub = 0.25\nand krub = 0.75, Vcmax(h = 0) = 65 mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031, as\ndetermined above for top leaves.\n[21] FLIGHT allows us to configure either 1-D uniform\ncanopies or 3-D heterogeneous forest stands. In this study\nthe latter have been created using ellipsoid crowns with\nmajor and minor axes of 5 m and 2.5 m, respectively. In\naccordance with in situ measurements (Table 1), trunks have\nbeen assigned heights between 8 m and 12 m and the\nfraction of open ground, not lying vertically below trees, is\n0.4. For all simulations, scattering from leaf elements is\nassumed to be bi-Lambertian. We adopt respective reflec-\ntion and transmission coefficients of 0.07 and 0.06 in the\nPAR waveband, consistent with measurements of pine\nneedles obtained in the field [Williams, 1991]. The ground\nalbedo has been set to 0.15 and reflection from the ground is\nassumed to be isotropic. A spherical LAD has been\nemployed [Falster and Westoby, 2003].\n3. Results\n[22] Figure 4 illustrates the observed canopy photosyn-\nthetic response at Zotino for the JJA period of 1999 and\n2000. The response flattens for relatively low sky radiance\n(\u2019800 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031) which may be attributable to the\nrather low LAI of the site or closure of the stomata during\nthe late morning. The pine stand is nevertheless fairly well\nadapted to the maximum I0 at this latitude with only 30% of\ndaylight hours during the JJA period lying above the\naforementioned saturation threshold. Carbon assimilation\nappears to be slightly enhanced under diffuse light con-\nditions but at a level which is barely statistically significant.\nFor example, for I0 > 300 mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031, Ac is higher under\ndiffuse sky radiance by 0.53 \u00b1 0.28 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031 and\n0.71 \u00b1 0.33 for 1999 and 2000, respectively. This corre-\nsponds to relative increases of just 7% and 9%.\n[23] Figure 5 depicts the FLIGHT simulations for 1999\nusing minimum and maximum values of LAI. The figure\nalso demonstrates the light-acclimated case where krub = kext\n\f 0.75. For maximum LAI (3.5 m2 m\u00032), the model is fairly\nclose to the observed response although it fails to saturate at\nhigh I0 in the same way as the measurements. A\nmore saturated response is produced by both the LAI =\n1.3 m2 m\u00032 case and the light-acclimated scenario but, here,\nthe predicted canopy assimilation is\f50% too low. A gentle\nvertical fall-off in Rubisco (krub < kext) is a prerequisite to\nfitting the model to the observations. However, the low LAI\nscenario is still possible if the quantum efficiency is\nincreased from 0.03 to 0.045 and the leaf nitrogen is\nincreased by 23% so that Vcmax is 80 mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031 at the\ncanopy top. The increase in quantum efficiency seems\nreasonable given that our calibration for this parameter\nwas originally based on Jack Pine rather than Scots\nPine. A value of 0.045 is much closer to field measurements\nrecorded by other authors for needleleaves [Lewis et al.,\n2000]. The 23% increase in Vcmax implies a leaf nitrogen that\nis close to the upper limit recorded by Wirth et al. [2002] at\nthe site (3.20 \u00b1 0.55 gNm\u00032). The LAI = 3.5 m2 m\u00032 and\nFigure 3.

The solid line represents our C3 leaf model calibrated with Vcmax =\n56 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031.\nD23209 ALTON ET AL.: RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A PINE FOREST\n7 of 13\nD23209\nLAI = 1.3 (nitrogen-adjusted) simulations predict the ob-\nserved response to within an error of 12% (r.m.s.).\n[24] For all model predictions (including 1-D simulations\nnot shown here), carbon assimilation appears to be 10\u201320%\nhigher under diffuse sky radiance (fDIF = 0.75) compared\nto direct sunlight (fDIF = 0.25). About half of this increase\ncan be attributed purely to diffuse light, the remainder\narising from systematic differences in solar zenith angle\nand stomatal closure under the two light regimes (Table 2).\nWhile the forest absorbs an almost identical fraction of PAR\nunder diffuse and direct sky radiance, diffuse photons are\nabsorbed preferentially near the canopy top where Rubisco\nconcentration, and therefore light-saturated photosynthetic\nrates, are highest. To test the idea that diffuse sky radiance\nexposes a greater fraction of the canopy foliage to sunlight\n[Gu et al., 2002], we have repeated our simulations using a\nuniform Rubisco distribution (i.e., krub = 0) and a sky\nradiation field of either pure diffuse (fDIF = 1) or pure\ndirect (fDIF = 0) light. Furthermore, we have configured\nLAI-equivalent, uniform 1-D canopies to compare with the\n3-D model and thus elucidate the interplay of canopy\narchitecture with isotropic sky radiance. For our LAI =\n3.5 m2 m\u00032 simulations, between 0.25 and 0.5 of the foliage\ncontributes nothing to the canopy photosynthetic rate (Al\u0001 0)\nwhen exposed to pure direct sunlight. Under a purely diffuse\nsky this inactive fraction reduces to 0.25 (comparison made\nfor I0 = 500 mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031 and I0 = 1000 with qs = 57\u0004).\nNotably, the median leaf-irradiance is smaller in the diffuse\nregime, increasing the average LUE of leaves exposed to\nsunlight. Somewhat surprisingly, the fractions of foliage\nexposed to PAR are the same for both the 3-D and 1-D\narchitectures (for both the direct and diffuse regimes).\n[25] In Figure 6 we illustrate the equivalent Big Leaf\nresponse (hypothetical flat leaf of area 1 m2 situated at the\ntop of the canopy) for the simulations in Figure 5. Note that\nfor LAI = 1.3 m2 m\u00032 model we have adjusted Vcmax and\nthe quantum efficiency, as described above. In Figure 7 we\nhave tested the importance of the vertical Rubisco distribu-\ntion in maximizing the canopy assimilation rate. We have\nsimulated canopy photosynthesis for krub varying between 0\nto 2, while conserving the total amount of Rubisco (active\nleaf nitrogen) present in the canopy. Figure 7 illustrates the\ncase for our LAI = 3.5 m2m\u00032 model but the behavior for\nLAI = 1.3 (adjusted Vcmax) is qualitatively similar. The\nfigure also shows the assimilation rate for a 1-D uniform\nclosed canopy possessing the same LAI as Zotino.\n4. Discussion\n[26] The discussion of our results focuses on the three\nmain themes of the paper, diffuse light, scale-up of photo-\nsynthesis, and optimal canopy assimilation.\n4.1. Diffuse Light\n[27] The observed (\u000110%) and predicted (10\u201320%)\nenhancement in LUE for Zotino under diffuse sky irradi-\nance is much lower than the 50\u2013100% increase found by\nother authors for both broadleaf and needleleaf canopies\n[Hollinger et al., 1994; Gu et al., 2002; Niyogi et al., 2004].\nMoreover, an increase in the diffuse fraction, fDIF, from\n0.25 to 0.75 is associated with a SW dimming of factor 2\n(Figure 2). For the observed Zotino response in 1999 this\ncorresponds to a reduction in canopy assimilation of \f25\u2013\n50% (comparison made at I0 = 500 mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031 and 1000\nwhen fDIF = 0.25). After varying the configurations of our\nsimulations (LAI, qs, cover fraction), we conclude that\nin general, the LUE enhancement due to diffuse light is\ngreatest for isolated trees of moderate\/high LAI (\u00023 m2 m\u00032)\nexposed to an overhead Sun (LUE increase of factor \f2).\nOnly under these circumstances is the total carbon assimi-\nlated likely to be greater under overcast skies compared to\nseasonally equivalent cloud-free days.\n[28] We emphasize that the carbon flux measurements,\nagainst which we compare the simulations, are themselves\nsubject to a large degree of scatter (s.d. \f2 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031)\nalthough adopting a mean response over a limited part of\nthe season reduces this uncertainty. It might be argued that\nthe footprint of the lower eddy covariance device is much\nsmaller than the corresponding instrument situated above\nthe canopy and that this may distort our results. To test this\nidea, we have substituted the bottom flux in equation (6) by\na temperature-dependent respiration model created from\nFigure 4. The canopy photosynthetic rate, Ac, measured\nfor the Scots Pine stand at Zotino during the June\/July\/\nAugust period of 1999 (top) and 2000 (bottom). I0 is the\nphotosynthetically active radiation incident in the horizontal\nplane at the top of the canopy. Solid and open circles denote\nthe estimated canopy assimilation rate under diffuse light\nconditions (fDIF \u0002 0.5) and under direct sunlight (fDIF <\n0.5), respectively. The error bars represent the error in the\nmean (\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ns:d:=n\np\n).\nD23209 ALTON ET AL.: RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A PINE FOREST\n8 of 13\nD23209\nnighttime fluxes with moderate wind speed (>3 ms\u00031; see,\nfor example, Medlyn et al. [2003]). The observed canopy\nresponse remained unchanged within the errors. This is in\ncontrast to the storage term in equation (6), which we found\nhighly influential in determining the canopy response.\nMuch of the carbon dioxide respired during the night is\nreabsorbed during the early and midmorning period with\nimperceptible downflow at the top eddy-covariance device.\nBy deliberately neglecting the storage term in equation (6),\nwe became aware of two important consequences for those\nFLUXNET sites where no storage is measured. Early\nmorning reabsorption tends to linearize the canopy response\n(i.e., subdued response for low I0) if storage is neglected.\nSecond, the response is more severely reduced for the direct\nregime (by up to 30%) because here, we select lower Sun\nelevation angles in order to able to compare with the\nequivalent diffuse sky radiance. The FLUXNET sites used\nin the diffuse\/direct light comparison of Niyogi et al. [2004]\nFigure 6. The big leaf response to photosynthetically active radiation incident in the horizontal plane\n(I0).

The plot shows the observed canopy assimilation for\n1999, removing the error bars for clarity.\nFigure 5.

During our analysis it\nbecame clear that limiting the temperature range over which\nmeasurements were compared reduced the impact of sto-\nmatal closure, particularly for the direct sunlight regime\nwhere air vapor deficits tend to be high. Moreover, as\nalluded to in section 2.3.2, any seasonal bias in the sampling\nof diffuse and direct measurements is likely to lead to\nspurious differences in the recorded responses. While pre-\nvious authors have accepted the importance of seasonal\neffects, it is not clear to us if, and how, systematic offsets in\ntemperature and canopy humidity have been eliminated or\naccounted for in the past.\n[29] We emphasize that the inferences from our simula-\ntions are more or less insensitive to the particular optical\nproperties that we have adopted for the leaves and the\nground. Changes of \u00b10.05 in leaf reflectance, leaf transmis-\nsion, and ground albedo generally modify the predicted\ncanopy assimilation rate by 3\u20135% and thus our conclu-\nsions remain unchanged. Perhaps due to the high latitude\nof Zotino, adopting a planar or erectophile LAD alters\nour predictions by very little (\u00013%). The radiance from\nan overcast sky can deviate somewhat from perfect\nisotropy. When implementing the empirical relation given\nby Steven and Unsworth [1980], for example, our pre-\ndicted canopy assimilation changes by \u00011%. The as-\nsumption that leaf temperature is both uniform and\nclose to that of the above-canopy airspace is a serious\nlimitation in our model. Small needleleaves appear to\nremain within 2\u20133 K of air temperature whatever the\nstomatal resistance [Campbell and Norman, 1998] and we\nestimate the impact on canopy assimilation to be less than\n8%. The comparative study of diffuse and direct light\nwould not be affected since the mean temperature is\napproximately the same for both groups of measurements\n(Table 2). We have also assumed (necessarily) that all\nleaves in the canopy maintain the same internal CO2\nconcentration at any given time (section 2.2). There is\nsome evidence that leaves act to regulate their internal\nCO2 concentration so as to maintain a steady value\n[Campbell and Norman, 1998].\n4.2. Scale-Up\n[30] Figure 6 demonstrates the main problems asso-\nciated with the Big Leaf approximation. Note that this\nformulation assumes Beer\u2019s law and a light-acclimated\nvertical distribution of Rubisco. Under such circumstances\nthe scale-up in photosynthetic rate from a hypothetical,\nflat top-leaf of area 1 m2, Atl, to the total canopy\nassimilation rate, Ac, is given as follows [e.g., Schulze\net al., 1994]:\nAc \u00bc Atl 1\u0003 exp \u0003LAIkext\u00f0 \u00de\nkext\n: \u00f09\u00de\nFor light extinction appropriate to the Zotino stand (kext \f\n0.75) the Big Leaf approximation predicts a scale-up factor,\nAc\/Atl, of 0.83 and 1.23 for LAI of 1.3 m\n2 m\u00032 and 3.5,\nrespectively. Such scaling of the top leaf overpredicts the\ncanopy photosynthetic rate by 18% (r.m.s.) and 30%,\nrespectively, compared to observations. This should be\ncompared with the FLIGHT prediction (section 3) where the\ncorresponding error is 12%. The overestimation of the Big\nLeaf is particularly severe at low I0 (\u0001500 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031)\nwhere canopy assimilation is at least 50% too high\ncompared to observation. In spite of this, the true canopy\nresponse does flatten (somewhat like a Big Leaf) but at\nhigher sky radiance (I0 \u0002 800 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031). This may be\nattributable to light saturation of a canopy possessing a\nsparse foliage. In the future, it will be of interest to see\nFigure 7.

Simulations are shown for an open 3-D stand with cover fraction 60% (solid lines)\nand a uniform, closed 1-D canopy (dashed lines) of the same LAI (3.5 m2 m\u00032). In all cases, the fraction\nof diffuse sky radiance is 0.5 and the sun has a position of qs = 57\u0004. Sky radiance (I0) is either\n500 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031 (solid circles) or 1000 (solid squares).\nD23209 ALTON ET AL.: RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A PINE FOREST\n10 of 13\nD23209\nwhether such behavior is exhibited by canopies of higher\nLAI or whether the observed canopy response is so linear\nthat it cannot possibly be reproduced by the Big Leaf\napproximation. The inability of the Big Leaf model to\npredict canopy assimilation correctly for the whole range of\nsky radiances has been recognized by previous authors\n[Friend, 2001; Medlyn et al., 2003]. Since the Big Leaf\napproximation assumes a 1-D canopy, it is not too\nsurprising that it does not perform convincingly for an\nopen canopy such as Zotino.\n4.3. Optimal Canopy Assimilation\n[31] Figure 7 reveals two interesting aspects of carbon\nassimilation in the Zotino canopy and how it is affected\nby the vertical distribution of Rubisco (leaf nitrogen):\n(1) The assimilation rate changes slowly for relatively\nlarge changes in krub such that the value maximizing Ac is\npoorly defined. For the 3-D configuration, for example,\nthe maximum assimilation rate is only 6% higher com-\npared to a zero redistribution in leaf nitrogen (krub = 0).\n(Strictly speaking, this applies only to the LAI =\n3.5 m2m\u00032 scenario. The same simulation run with the\nnitrogen-adjusted LAI = 1.3 m2m\u00032 model produces a\ncorresponding gain of just 2%.) (2) Maximum assimila-\ntion does not occur when krub = kext(\f0.8) as assumed in\nthe Big Leaf approximation. For optimal assimilation in\nthe 3-D canopy a slightly shallower vertical falloff is\nrequired (krub \f 0.5), whereas a steeper Rubisco distri-\nbution (krub \f 1.1) maximizes photosynthesis within the\nuniform 1-D stand.\n[32] The smooth change in canopy assimilation rate can\nbe attributed, in part, to the colimitation factors of the C3\nphotosynthesis model which ensure a smooth transition\nfrom one limiting rate to another (e.g., the transition from\na light-limited to a Rubisco-limited regime). These factors\nare present in the model to reflect observed leaf behavior.\nThe large dispersion in leaf irradiance, which is expected to\noccur for foliage of different geometrical orientations\n(Figure 1), also limits the advantage that any one distribu-\ntion of Rubisco may confer to the canopy assimilation rate\n(leaves in full sunlight will nearly always be Rubisco-\nlimited whatever the vertical distribution in leaf nitrogen).\nThe shallow Rubisco gradient required for the 3-D canopy\ncan be explained by the shape of the trees. Optimal\nconfiguration requires a compromise between light-\nattenuation (kext) and the amount of foliage available to\nabsorb PAR. The latter is maximum at the midheight of the\ncanopy. The 1-D canopy removes all considerations of tree\nshape and here the optimal Rubisco distribution is much\nsteeper. Thus in the 1-D scenario krub > kext and this steep,\noptimal Rubisco distribution is explained by a vertical\nfalloff in leaf irradiance which is actually somewhat\nsteeper for a spherical LAD compared to flat leaves (kext in\nequation (8) refers to the horizontal plane). This difference\ncan be attributable to the component of diffuse light which\nhas a distribution of photon angles which changes signifi-\ncantly between the top and bottom of the canopy. In\nparticular, sky photons impinging obliquely with respect\nto the horizontal plane at the top of the canopy are absorbed\npreferentially by foliage situated near the canopy ceiling.\nThe result is that when diffuse light constitutes an important\nfraction of sky radiance the exponential falloff in leaf\nirradiance is slightly steeper than that indicated by light\nattenuation in the horizontal plane. This point underlines the\nlikelihood that vertical profiles of light extinction are, in any\ncase, unlikely to be purely exponential in the field [e.g.,\nParker et al., 2002]. Similarly, leaf nitrogen may also\ndeviate from an exponential vertical decline [Warren and\nAdams, 2001; Meir et al., 2002]. Such considerations\ncompound the difficulty of quantifying light acclimation\nwithin \u2018\u2018real\u2019\u2019 tree canopies.\n5. Conclusions\n[33] Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows:\n[34] 1. We have enhanced the numerical, ray-tracing\nsimulation FLIGHT to calculate photosynthesis in 3-D\nheterogeneous tree canopies. The primary variables of the\nmodel are leaf area index, air temperature, and photosyn-\nthetically active radiation incident at the top of the canopy.\nMeasurements of canopy transpiration and air humidity\nregulate stomatal conductance. For the minimum and max-\nimum LAI recorded for the site (1.3 m2 m\u00032 and 3.5\nrespectively), the expanded model reproduces well the\ncanopy assimilation measured for a Siberian pine forest\n(Zotino) where carbon flow has been monitored extensively\nwith multiple eddy-covariance devices. The r.m.s. differ-\nence between model and observation is 12% across the full\nrange of sky radiance. The minimum LAI scenario requires\nadjustments to the two physiological parameters controlling\nleaf photosynthesis in the simulation (quantum efficiency\nand top-leaf nitrogen). However, these modifications appear\nreasonable within the uncertainties of leaf properties for the\nsite.\n[35] 2. For the same sky radiance, the observed canopy-\nassimilation at Zotino is only modestly enhanced, if at all\n(\u000110%), under diffuse sky radiance compared to direct\nsunlight. Similarly, our simulations predict an enhancement\nof only 10\u201320% in canopy LUE when the proportion of\ndiffuse sky radiation is 75% compared to 25%. Thus in\ncontrast to the findings of previous authors, monitoring both\nbroadleaf and needleleaf canopies [Hollinger et al., 1994;\nGu et al., 2002; Niyogi et al., 2004], we believe the Zotino\npine stand does not assimilate more carbon on overcast days\ncompared to seasonally equivalent sunny days. The en-\nhancement in LUE under diffuse sky radiance arises from\n(1) absorption of photons closer to the canopy top where\nRubisco capacity is higher and (2) an increase in the fraction\nof foliage exposed to moderate light levels.\n[36] 3. The scale-up from leaf model to observed canopy\nphotosynthesis, in mmol m\u00032s\u00031, is less than unity. The\nformer assumes a (hypothetical) flat leaf of 1 m2 situated at\nthe canopy top. The Big Leaf approximation, based on\nBeer\u2019s law for light attenuation and a light-acclimated\nRubisco distribution, implies scale-up factors of \u00011.24. It\noverestimates the observed canopy response by 24% on\naverage, i.e., twice the r.m.s. error of the FLIGHT simula-\ntion. The overprediction is particularly severe (\u000250%) at\nlow sky radiance (\u0001500 mmol m\u00032 s\u00031).\n[37] 4. Our RT model allows us to prescribe the vertical\nfall-off in Rubisco concentration through the canopy. To\nreproduce the canopy-assimilation observed at Zotino, we\nrequire a Rubisco gradient which is shallower than the\ngradient of the corresponding light profile. According to\nD23209 ALTON ET AL.: RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN A PINE FOREST\n11 of 13\nD23209\nour simulations, the canopy assimilation-rate varies only\nslightly for relatively large changes in the vertical distribu-\ntion of Rubisco (assuming conservation of total active leaf\nnitrogen). This is due to the colimitation factors of our C3\nleaf model which reflect the observed smooth transition\nfrom one limiting rate to another for individual leaves (e.g.,\nlight-limited to Rubisco-limited regime). Furthermore, the\nhigh dispersion in leaf irradiance at any depth within the\ncanopy, which can be expected for foliage possessing a\nrange of geometrical orientations, reduces the benefit that\nany particular configuration in leaf nitrogen might confer to\nthe stand. Our 3-D simulations of Zotino imply that assim-\nilation is only 2\u20136% higher when Rubisco is distributed so\nas to maximize canopy photosynthesis compared to a\nvertically uniform distribution in leaf nitrogen. Furthermore,\neven when leaf nitrogen is configured optimally, the implied\nRubisco gradient is shallower than that of the light gradient\ndue to the concentration of foliage at the midheight of the\ncanopy.\nAppendix A\n[38] Our photosynthesis model follows the Collatz for-\nmulation for C3 type vegetation [Collatz et al., 1991]. The\nleaf photosynthetic rate Al (mmol m\n\u00032 s\u00031) is the smoothed\nminimum of three limits: photosynthetic rate due to incident\nlight JPAR; photosynthetic capacity due to the concentration\nand chemical activity of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carbox-\nylase\/oxygenase (i.e., Rubisco) Jr; and the photosynthetic\nrate based on the ability of the leaf to export the products of\nphotosynthesis Je. Thus\nJPAR \u00bc aIPAR Ci \u0003 C0\nCi \u00fe 2\tC0 ; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwhere the quantum efficiency a is a dimensionless,\nphysiological parameter describing the quasi-linear re-\nsponse of leaf photosynthesis to low light levels. IPAR\n(mmol m\u00032 s\u00031) is the leaf irradiance. Ci (mol mol\n\u00031) and C0\n(mol mol\u00031) are the CO2 concentration internal to the leaf\nand the photorespiratory compensatory point, respectively.\nThe latter depends on the ambient oxygen concentration Oa\n(mol mol\u00031) and the leaf temperature Tl (K). Thus\nC0 \u00bc 0:5\tOa\n2600\t0:570:1 Tl\u0003298\u00f0 \u00de : \u00f0A2\u00de\nThe Rubisco-limited rate of leaf photosynthesis is given by\nJr \u00bc Vm\t Ci \u0003 C0\u00f0 \u00de\nCi \u00fe Kc 1\u00fe OaKo\n\u0003 \u0004 ; \u00f0A3\u00de\nwhere Kc (mol mol\n\u00031) and Ko (mol mol\n\u00031) are the\nMichaelis constants determining the competing rates of\ncarboxylation and oxygenation. Although denoted as\n\u2018\u2018constants\u2019\u2019 both of these parameters depend on leaf\ntemperature. Vm (mmol m\n\u00032s\u00031) describes the chemical\nactivity of Rubisco and is expressed thus:\nVm \u00bc Vcmaxq\n0:1 Tl\u0003298\u00f0 \u00de\n10\n1\u00fe e0:3 Tl\u0003Thi\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\t 1\u00fe e0:3 Tlo\u0003Tl\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de ; \u00f0A4\u00de\nwhere q10 is a dimensionless coefficient for leaf respiration\nwhich we set to 2.0. Tlo (K) and Thi (K) are instrumental in\nlimiting the temperature bandwidth over which photosynth-\nesis is possible and we set these parameters to 268 K and\n304 K, respectively, for the purposes of this study. The\nconclusions of this work remain independent of Tlo and Thi.\nAlthough Jr can change by \u201910% for reasonable adjust-\nments in these parameters, the impact on canopy photo-\nsynthetic rate is much less (\f1%). Vcmax (mmol m\u00032s\u00031) is a\nphysiological parameter of the plant which determines the\nRubisco-limited rate of photosynthesis under optimal\nconditions of leaf temperature and the saturation of\ncarboxylation sites within the leaf by CO2. It is proportional\nto the active nitrogen content of the leaf expressed as mol N\nper m2 of leaf surface. Finally, the export-limited rate of leaf\nphotosynthesis is determined by\nJe \u00bc Vm\n2\n: \u00f0A5\u00de\nLeaf respiration is set to 0.015 \t Vm [Collatz et al., 1991].\n[39] Acknowledgments.
