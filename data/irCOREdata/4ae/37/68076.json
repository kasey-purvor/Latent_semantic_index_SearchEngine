Background\nGeomagnetically induced currents (GICs) are a natural\nhazard that can affect conducting infrastructures, such as\npower grids and pipelines (e.g. Boteler et al., 1998; Kap-\npenman, 1996, 2004; Pirjola, 2002). GICs are a direct result\nof solar activity, which gives rise to space weather and con-0273-1177\/$36.00 Crown copyright \u0002 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on beh\ndoi:10.1016\/j.asr.2009.11.023\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: awpt@bgs.ac.uk (A.W.P. Thomson).sequently to geomagnetic storms. Besides power grids and\npipelines, space weather can disrupt communications, use\nof the global positioning system (GPS), and pose risks to\nsatellite and spacecraft operations. (Recent summaries on\nthe space weather hazard can be found in, for example,\nLanzerotti et al. (1999), Pirjola et al. (2005), Thomson\n(2007) and Eastwood (2008)).\nThe origin of GICs and space weather lies in the Sun\u2019s\nmagnetic activity cycle. The most significant solar phenome-\nnon for space weather is a \u2018coronal mass ejection\u2019 (CME).alf of COSPAR. All rights reserved.\nA.W.P. Thomson et al. \/ Advances in Space Research 45 (2010) 1182\u20131190 1183Heading Earthward in one to three days, CMEs evolve as\nthey interact with the ambient solar wind flow.When CMEs\nimpact the Earth\u2019s protective magnetosphere, their energy\nand electrical plasma boost existingmagnetospheric currents.\nThese current systems cause large magnetic variations that\ninduce electric fields in the solid Earth. These fields, in turn,\ngenerate theGICs that flow in conducting pipes andwires, in\nways influenced by the electrical properties of each network.\nThere is much documented and anecdotal evidence of\nthe effects of GICs on the power systems of the devel-\noped world (e.g. Bolduc, 2002; Molinski, 2002; Pulkkinen\net al., 2005; Kappenman, 2005; Trichtchenko et al.,\n2007). The most widely known example of a damaging\nimpact is the collapse of the Hydro Quebec power sys-\ntem on 13th March 1989. A severe geomagnetic storm\nshut down the complete high voltage system of Quebec,\nestimated at within 1 min and 10 s, with a consequent\neconomic cost and social disruption (Bolduc, 2002).\nMore recent storms, for example, the October 2003 \u2018Hal-\nloween\u2019 magnetic storm (which resulted in lower latitude\nauroral activity, as in Fig. 1), are also known to haveFig. 1.

An estimate of\nthe present-day economic cost of a repeat of the most\nsevere geomagnetic storm known (the \u2018Carrington Storm\u2019\nof September 1859) has also recently been made by the\nUS National Research Council (2008).\nTogether with the power grid evidence there is now\nmore than 30 years of scientific research into the subject\n(including, recently, Erinmez et al., 2002; Kappenman,\n2005; Pulkkinen et al., 2005; Wik et al., 2008). Progress\nhas certainly been made, in terms of quantifying the Sun\u2013\nEarth magnetic connection. However, much remains to\nbe done. In those 30+ years it has been found that under-\nstanding the geomagnetic hazard is a truly cross-disciplin-\nary activity, particularly when considering its impact on\ntechnology at ground level. There is therefore much scope\nremaining for engagement between solar-, space- and geo-\nphysicists and the power engineering community, to turn\nscientific knowledge into practical tools for risk assessment\nand hazard mitigation.otographed on 29 October at the time when the CME that emanated from\nd an extreme geomagnetic storm and pushed the auroral oval as far south\n.com.)

Using\ntheir expertise in space physics, geophysics and electrical\npower engineering, the workshop participants spent a week\ndiscussing issues within the GIC risk to high voltage power\ngrids, in both developed and developing countries around\nthe world. Examples of European and African national\npower grids were examined.\nOne aim of the GIC workshop was the free exchange of\nideas, insights and knowledge on the natural geomagnetic\nhazard and on GIC risk. This was for mutual education\nand to help promote future research between the two coun-\ntries in the cross-disciplinarymanner suggested above.A sec-\nond aim of the workshopwas to summarise the scientific and\nengineering \u2018state of play\u2019 for the power engineering indus-\ntry, for the public and for policy makers. The workshop par-\nticipants therefore compiled a short list of major points that\nthey believed with some confidence that scientists and engi-\nneers do know about the GIC risk to electric power systems,\nas well as major things we still do not know.\nIn the following sectionswe list, in relatively simple terms,\n10 major \u2018do knows\u2019 and 10 major \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 about GIC\nrisk, together with some short explanatory notes. The 10\nitems on each of the two lists are ordered approximately in\nthe time-order of CME onset through to power system dam-\nage and not in any order of relative importance.\n3. Ten things we do know about the GIC risk to power grids\n1. Solar storms (i.e. CMEs) that lead to high levels of\nGICs are statistically more likely during periods close to\nsolar maximum and in the descending phase of the solar\ncycle, but they do also occur at all other times in the solar\nactivity cycle (as identified in Fig. 2).\nThe number of major CMEs varies with the cycle of\nsolar (sunspot) activity. However, large amplitude erup-\ntions do occur even when the magnetic activity cycle is\nat a minimum, for example, in 1986. This means that\nthe GIC risk is not restricted to just a few years around\nthe maximum in solar activity. It is always present.\n2. The magnetospheric and ionospheric currents that\ndrive GICs are different at different latitudes (see, for exam-\nple, the complex and dynamic systemof ionospheric currents\nshown in Fig. 3 for northern Europe during one major\nstorm).The Earth\u2019s near-space environment (the magneto-\nsphere) contains a complex system of diffuse, but large\nscale electrical currents that connect with currents that\nflow in the ionosphere, in the upper atmosphere. Thesecurrents are modulated and amplified by solar activity.\nThe structure and dynamics of these current systems\nchanges with latitude. Understanding the details of the\nbehaviour of these current systems, and their effects, is\nan active research area in space- and geo-physics,\nthough the broad picture is widely agreed. For example,\nat higher latitudes the \u2018auroral electrojets\u2019 induce largely\neast\u2013west surface electric fields. In principle, the largest\nvoltage difference across a power network should occur\nin this orientation. However, it turns out to be incorrect\nto assume that the largest GICs always occur in trans-\nmission segments with an east\u2013west orientation; in some\ncases an almost north\u2013south orientation may be more\nimportant.\n3. The dominant cause of GICs in power grids is the\ntime rate of change of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.There are firm theoretical reasons for this, as well as the\nsimple observation of a strong linear correlation between\nthe time-rate-of-change of the magnetic field and mea-\nsured GICs, at all latitudes. Accurate prediction of GIC\nrisk then requires accurate prediction of changes in the\nmagnetic field (see, for example, Wintoft, 2005). This is\nstill scientifically hard to do. (We should note also that\nrecent work has suggested significant correlations\nbetween GIC and the field itself: Watari et al., 2009.)\n4. Interpolating the magnetic field from spatially distrib-\nuted geomagnetic observations improves the prediction\naccuracy of GICs at any given point, even at mid-latitudes\nFig. 3. The complexity of ionospheric current vectors are shown, derived from UK and Scandinavian magnetometer data near the time of the storm\ncommencement during the July 15th 2000 magnetic storm. The scale vector at top left is 8 nT\/s. Coloured spots denote measured GIC at six points in\nnational power grids at the time (red denotes a GIC flowing to the Earth) and in one gas pipeline in Finland. Spot size is proportional to measured current:\nthe largest current in this image was around 11 A at the time.

Thomson et al. \/ Advances in Space Research 45 (2010) 1182\u20131190 1185(e.g. Bernhardi et al., 2008). This is in comparison with pre-\ndictions made from data from a single magnetic observa-\ntory, taken to be representative of the \u2018regional\u2019 situation.This follows from point 2. The natural magnetic field at\nany point in a power grid, where we need to predict\nGICs, is mostly affected by those magnetospheric and\nionospheric currents systems that are closest to it. Neigh-\nbouring permanent geomagnetic observatories are the\nbest means to interpolate geomagnetic activity to a given\nmeasurement site. Simplified assumptions \u2013 such as the\nso-called \u2018plane-wave model\u2019, which is based on single-\nsite data \u2013 give an incomplete picture of magneticchanges across regional scale power grids. In addition,\nmeasured GIC at any point may be the sum of induction\nprocesses in several connected transmission lines.\n5. GICs are larger in countries and regions where the\ngeology is generally more resistive (discussed, e.g., in Pirj-\nola and Viljanen, 1991).While the magnitude of the magnetic field change is the\nmost significant variable affecting the magnitude of the\nGICs, higher resistance rock increases the natural sur-\nface electric field that acts as the voltage source (or \u2018bat-\ntery\u2019) for GICs, operating in the line between the\n1186 A.W.P. Thomson et al. \/ Advances in Space Research 45 (2010) 1182\u20131190neighbouring grounding points in any given grid (see,\ne.g. Boteler and Pirjola, 1998). Conductivity is a func-\ntion not just of rock type, but also of fluid and mineral\ncontent, and needs to be considered separately for each\npower network region.\n6. A multi-layered and laterally varying ground conduc-\ntivity model gives better prediction of GICs, than the sim-\npler assumption of an homogeneous Earth (e.g. Ngwira\net al., 2008; Thomson et al., 2005).Closer correlation between measured data and scientific\nmodels of GICs is obtained by using a three-dimensional\nconductivity model of the Earth.\n7. GICs have been demonstrated to affect power systems\nat all latitudes (see, for example, damage to a South Afri-\ncan transformer shown in Fig. 4).There is a perception, particularly common within gov-\nernment and industry, that GICs are a risk only for\npower grids at relatively high latitudes. For example,\nGICs in the past have been widely reported and ana-\nlysed in Canada, Finland and Scandinavia. GICs have,\nhowever, also been measured and reported in more\nmid-latitude counties such as the UK and USA. The\nworkshop participants, however, also learned of GIC\neffects and studies in South Africa and Brazil, both\ncountries at low geographic and geomagnetic latitudes,\nand learned of anecdotal evidence for GIC impacts else-\nwhere in the world, at all latitudes. Recent research\npapers from Japan (data from around 44\u0003 north: Watari\net al., 2009) and China (around 23\u0003 north: Liu et al.,\n2009) are testament to this. This means that assessingFig. 4. Failure in a large South African generator transformer three weeks afte\ninsulation by the arcing fault at the time of final failure is clear. The arcing fa\nprogression of damage after initiation by the geomagnetic current event. (For in\nto the web version of this paper.)the risk from space weather to our technological infra-\nstructure is a concern for all countries.\n8. GICs can affect many power transformers simulta-\nneously at multiple points across regional and continental\nscale networks (e.g. GIC data in Fig. 3).This distinguishes global and continental scale space\nweather impacts from localised terrestrial weather\nimpacts such as lightning, ice and severe wind storms.\nGICs require a different approach to the analysis of\npower system failure, in comparison with standard\napproaches that usually assume independence of events\ninitiating system faults (\u2018contingencies\u2019).\n9. Series capacitors in transmission lines may interrupt\nGIC flow in power networks, but are expensive. However,\nsome strategies involving capacitors may increase GIC and\nreactive power demands (e.g. Erinmez et al., 2002).Engineering and mitigation strategies are known to exist\nthat are intended to protect against GIC damage. How-\never, this \u2018do know\u2019 tells us that any network as a whole\nmust be protected. Attempting to protect single or just a\nfew assets will merely redistribute GICs and may put\nother assets at risk. Lower-cost mitigation techniques\ncan be implemented instead of series capacitors in the\ntransmission lines, but these have other effects on power\nsystem operation. The capacity to mitigate the impact of\nGICs might not be within the scope or control of inde-\npendent and individual owners of transmission networks\nand power stations. Careful network planning, numeri-\ncal modelling and testing is suggested in each case.r the Halloween storm of October 2003. The disruption of the winding and\nult also destroys evidence that might lead to a better understanding of the\nterpretation of the references to colour in this figure, the reader is referred\n3Feb04 Halloween storm \n2Methane \n400 \n200 \n0 \n2Hydrogen \n1Methane \n1Ethane \n1Ethylene \nTransformer load: \nMW sent out (x2) \n3 months \n2Ethane\n2Ethylene \n1Hydrogen \nFig. 5. Results of dissolved gas analysis (ppm \u2013 left scale) for two similar generator transformers in South Africa (labelled 1 and 2). This illustrates\ncontinued gas generation after the short geomagnetic storm (only a few hours) and an apparent sensitivity to transformer loading (MW \u2013 same scale)\nduring the following months. The ratios of the different gases also indicate low temperature degradation of paper insulation. Both transformers were\nremoved from service approximately 6 months after the storm. Note: the dashed lines indicate the increase from nominal pre- to immediate post-storm\nlevels for each data type. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure, the reader is referred to the web version of this paper.)\nA.W.P. Thomson et al. \/ Advances in Space Research 45 (2010) 1182\u20131190 118710. It is possible from transformer dissolved gas analysis\nto identify GIC-initiated damage before complete trans-\nformer failure occurs (see, for example, Fig. 5). This is\nespecially true if the rate of gassing simultaneously\nincreases in widely separated transformers across a\nnetwork.Excessive heating in a transformer leads to the break-\ndown of the insulation, releasing gas that can be\ndetected. Tracking the changing level of evolved gas\ncan indicate the risk of future cumulative damage to\neach transformer, for example, while measured GICs\nremain below warning thresholds.4. Ten things we do not know about the GIC risk to power\ngrids\n1. What are the solar and interplanetary events and sig-\nnatures (peaks, duration, location) that are most \u2018geo-effec-\ntive\u2019, in terms of GIC causation. For example, what\nsignificance, if any, can be attached to reported peak solarflare magnitudes, e.g. as listed in Table 1, in understanding\nhistorical GIC?Scientists have relatively detailed data on solar and\ninterplanetary events going back just 40 years or so.\nWe therefore do not yet know the extremes to which\nthe Sun can operate or know with certainty which par-\nticular \u2018markers\u2019 of solar activity are most relevant. Pro-\ngress on models of solar and solar wind variability is\nalso required.\n2. What are the characteristics of extreme geomagnetic\nstorms that pose the highest risk to power systems (see,\nfor example, the relation of major storms to the sunspot\ncycle shown in Fig. 6)?This is related to point 1. Scientists also have relatively\ndetailed and continuous data on geomagnetic events\ngoing back to around the 1840s. In many respects the\n\u2018Carrington Storm\u2019 (1st September 1859) was a far more\nsevere storm than any that has been measured since (see,\ne.g. US National Research Council, 2008).

Thomson et al. \/ Advances in Space Research 45 (2010) 1182\u20131190ity of another event of a similar magnitude to this there-\nfore needs to be carefully considered. All available data\nneeds to be fully scanned, digitized and exploited. In\nparticular we note that existing published hourly, daily\nand annual mean geomagnetic data are not sufficient\nto fully analyse GIC hazard: the periods of most interest\nare around a few seconds to a few tens of minutes.\n3. In predicting GICs, what is the relative contribution\nof each of the different components of the geomagnetic\nfield (i.e. the horizontal and vertical components and of\nthe total field magnitude), as well as the relevance of other\ndata, such as the ionospheric total electron content (TEC)\nand the interplanetary magnetic field magnitude and direc-\ntion (e.g. Pulkkinen et al., 2006)?We know that each of these factors is either directly\nrelevant or is a useful proxy for other relevant data,\nbut more study is required. What is the minimum\ninformation we need in order to maximise GIC pre-\ndiction accuracy? Can we, for example, derive useful\nnear real-time information on changing ionospheric\ncurrent systems from GPS TEC measurements that\nvary with time?4. What are the definitive spatial and temporal scales of\nthe magnetospheric and ionospheric currents that drive sig-\nnificant GICs in grids?GICs respond to magnetic variations on many time-\nscales. At this time it is believed that the dominant peri-\nods of interest are probably a few seconds to tens of\nminutes. How detailed do our ionospheric and magneto-\nspheric current models therefore need to be, in time and\nspace, to capture the physics of the problem?\n5. What is an adequate number and distribution of\nmagnetometers for GIC modelling in the UK and South\nAfrica (and similarly for other countries)?This is related to point 4. Can we define guidelines that\nhelp developed and developing countries, wherever they\nare, to set up networks of magnetometers; or do we need\nto approach the problem on a case by case basis, with\nregard to latitude, geology, geophysics and space\nphysics?\n6. Which information, given on what timescale, is most\nuseful for any given power utility\/authority to manage its\nGIC risk?CMEs take between just under one day and perhaps up\nto 3\u20134 days to reach the Earth. The solar physics under-\npinning CME formation and release is not well under-\nstood and predictive models of CMEs are limited in\ntheir capabilities. So much is still required scientifically.\nHowever, the question can still be posed of industry:\nwhat would be ideal and what would be desirable in\nterms of warning time and information content? Also,\nwhat are the costs and other consequences of incorrect\nhigh-activity forecasts?\n7. In modelling GICs in a power grid, what is an appro-\npriate level of detail required of Earth conductivity (as a\nthree-dimensional model or otherwise)?In practical terms simple conductivity models that vary\nonly with depth remain useful for inland continental\nregions, away from coasts. But what about the coasts,\nwhere many high-value generating assets are located,\ndue to proximity to cooling water and access to fuel?\nHow accurate does industry need GIC modelling to\nbe? How quickly do models have to perform to provide\nuseful forecast data, and does this imply restricting com-\nplexity of model to meet targets?\n8. What are the characteristics of power transformers\nthat determine their susceptibility to GICs and therefore\ndetermine the extent of damage sustained under different\nlevels of GICs?Industry data on transformer designs need to be exam-\nined in more detail (e.g. Lahtinen and Elovaara, 2002).\nHow can transformers be tested or certified for compli-\nance with specifications that are intended to reduce\ndamage by GICs?\nFig. 6. Large storms identified by the peak in the 24-h running average (aa*) of the 3-h geomagnetic aa index against time, since 1868, overlain with\nmonthly smoothed solar sunspot number. A threshold of 80 nT has been used to better identify the largest individual storms.

Thomson et al. \/ Advances in Space Research 45 (2010) 1182\u20131190 11899. What are the transformer failure mechanisms subse-\nquent to damage initiated by GICs?This is related to point 8. Major details are understood\nfrom observations of GIC damage, but laboratory tests\non failure modes are rare. How do gassing and other\ncondition monitoring records help? Are there emerging\nindustry standards for transformers, for protection\nagainst GICs and the subsequent deterioration leading\nto failure? What other work needs to be done here?\n10. Where should scientists go to gain access to industry\narchives, particularly archives of any GIC measurements\nobtained concurrently with network data (i.e. network con-\nfiguration and connections, DC resistances of transmission\nlines and transformers and station earthing resistances)?The absence of open source data is a continuing prob-\nlem for scientists, although the commercial issues are\nappreciated. However, some progress, perhaps through\nsupport from national industry regulators, industry or\nprofessional societies would be helpful. Also, there is a\nneed for long term monitoring in any given power grid,\nas the electrical (near-DC) characteristics of each grid\nchanges over time.5. Conclusions\nCompared with the \u2018do knows\u2019 in our list, our \u2018don\u2019t\nknows\u2019 may be more contentious within the scientific com-\nmunity. It may be debated which items are most important\nat the present time, understanding that other issues mightyet become more relevant. However, by making scientific\nprogress on our current \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 we do believe that\nscientists will improve their ability to monitor, model and\npredict the impacts of space weather and GICs on power\ngrids.\nSolar cycle 24 is just beginning and we can expect that\nthe space weather hazard to ground-based technologies will\nincrease, just as it did during the up-turn of previous cycles.\nThe main message of the Hermanus workshop is therefore\nthat we need a wider discussion on all of the issues, not just\nwithin the GIC science community, but also within indus-\ntry and wider society. We hope that our lists will go some\nway to start that discussion and promote much needed\nfuture research.\nA future scientific workshop is planned for 2010\/2011,\nagain in South Africa. This meeting is planned to be more\nbroadly based than the recent one was, involving invita-\ntions to specialists from outside the UK and South Africa.\nAt this meeting we will discuss what progress has been\nmade against our list of \u2018don\u2019t knows\u2019 and, in general, dis-\ncuss progress on GIC risk assessment and on the geomag-\nnetic hazard. We would also like to be able to consider the\nwider impacts of GIC, for example, within pipeline and\nrailway networks.Acknowledgements\nThe workshop was supported financially by a \u2018UK\u2013\nSouth Africa Science Network Phase II\u2019 grant.
