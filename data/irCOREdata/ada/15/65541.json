In this climate, the industry has come under increased scrutiny in \nterms of its sales and marketing practices and much of the focus has been on \nthe use of information technology to collect and use information about existing \nand prospective clients and their accounts. Yet, more recently, as investment in \nIT spending matures, the anticipated benefits from IT spending are being \nattenuated after the identification of potential pitfalls in the adoption of \ninformation technology to support sales and marketing [Carr, 2003; Speier & \nVenkatesh, 2002]. By contrast, the quantity of academic research in the area of \ntechnology and sales automation has not dramatically increased in the last 20 \nyears [Williams & Plouffe, 2006]. However, adopted SFA systems have a \nreported failure level of 60-75% [Petersen, 1997; Galvin, 2002]. \n \nFor some firms, continued use of traditional relationship marketing techniques \ncoupled with extra sales-training and a limited investment in sales force \nautomation (SFA) may be appropriate. For others, larger-scale investment in \nmore sophisticated SFA may be optimal. In this research, we focus on the \nadoption of SFA and address questions to do with the variables that underpin \nsophisticated use of these expensive, IT-based, systems to support the sales \nfunction.  \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 4 \nFactors influencing the level of uptake of SFA \nSFA systems have been defined, variously, as (i) centralised database systems \nthat can be accessed through a modem by remote laptop computers using \nspecial software - hence focusing on information-handling capacities \n[Parthasarathy & Sohi, 1997], or (ii) as the converting of manual sales activities \nto electronic processes through the use of various combinations of hardware \nand software [Erffmeyer & Johnson, 2001]. However,  several authors have \nnoted that there is a lack of a clear definition of SFA [Rivers & Dart, 1999]. In \nthe present research, we adopt a broad, practice-based, approach to SFA and \nsales information system usage [Widmier, Jackson, & McCabe, 2002], and \nutilise a definition incorporating the application of information to support the \nsales function and the automated collection of information to assist the sales \nfunction \u2013 for a full operational definition, see the methodology section, below. \n \nThe adoption of technological change has been well documented in the \nliterature with many studies based on the TAM model [Davis, 1989] where \nperceived usefulness and ease of use have been identified as important in the \nspeed and level at which SFA is adopted [Avlonitis & Panagopooulos, 2005; \nRobinson, Marshall & Stamps, 2005]. The ability of those adopting SFA to \novercome technical, organisational and strategic barriers has also been shown \nto be a critical factor in a number of studies [Pullig, Maxham, & Hair, 2001; \nScarbrough & Lannon, 1988]. Similarly, Galliers (1991) focused on general \nmanagement issues in successful planning of strategic information systems and \nconcluded that key factors were: the attitude, commitment and involvement of \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 5 \nmanagement; the current sophistication of IS within the company; the ability to \nmeasure and justify the benefits of strategic IS; and the integration of IS into \nbusiness strategy. Low usage of installed systems has been identified as a \nmajor factor underlying the \u201cproductivity paradox\u201d surrounding the poor return \non investment from information systems [Venkatesh & Davis, 2000]. The current \nhigh level of dissatisfaction with investment in SFA suggests, yet again, that \nhistory is repeating itself. \n \nOverall, research into the barriers to adoption of IT interventions are consistent \nwith a general conclusion that organizational barriers are, in reality, more \nimportant than technical barriers, but that this is frequently not recognized by \nthe adopting firms. Organizational barriers relate to structural issues - such as \nfragmentation and poor relations between functional departments - and an \nacceptance, by senior management, of the strategic benefits of IT intervention \nand a clear strategy for its implementation. These organizational barriers are \nlikely to be a particular problem for sales applications of IT, due to their \nboundary-spanning activities and their interface with customers in the market \nplace. It has been confirmed that there are clear distinctions between \norganizational and salesperson perspectives on the goals, benefits and \nobstacles associated with SFA [Honeycutt et al, 2005]. Next, we review the \nempirical evidence relating specifically to adoption of SFA systems. As we shall \nsee, the focus of this empirical research has been at the level of the individual \nsalesperson \u2013 rather than at the level of the organization. \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 6 \nAdoption of SFA has been suggested to be a two-stage process. Initially, the \norganisation makes a decision to adopt a SFA system, followed by an \nimplementation focus on encouraging the use of the SFA by individual \nsalespeople [Parthasarathy & Sohi, 1997]. However, many SFA projects have \nbeen classified as unsuccessful [Rivers & Dart, 1999] but, as has been noted, \nthe academic community \u201c\u2026remains silent in terms of reporting factors \nassociated with SFA adoption and use\u201d (p145). In fact, the majority of research \nthat has been conducted has focused on individual-level factors \u2013 i.e., at the \nlevel of the individual salesperson \u2013 leading to technology adoption and use \namongst the sales force demonstrate the importance of salespeople\u201fs attitudes \ntowards the new systems \u2013 including perceived usefulness and perceived \ncompatibility with existing systems [Jones, et al., 2002]. Similarly, the \nimportance of individual-level factors such as perceived ease of use and \nperceived usefulness \u2013 attitudes which themselves are shaped by general \nbeliefs that the individual holds about computers \u2013 is critical in the initial \nacceptance of SFA technology [Venkatesh, 2000]. Venkatesh and Davis (2000) \nextended this latter investigation by using three points of measurement \u2013 pre-\nimplementation, immediate post-implementation, and three months post-\nimplementation. These authors found that factors such as social influence \u2013 \nwhether an individual perceived that other individuals who were important to \nhim\/her thought he\/she should perform the behavior in question \u2013 were also \nimportant as were factors such as job relevance, perceived quality of the output \nof the technology, and perceived ease of use. Taken together, Venkatesh and \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 7 \nDavis found that these factors accounted for about 50% of the variance in \nusage intentions. \n \nA study on the usage of adopted SFA found that the major sales use was for \nsales calls and expense reports [Widmier, et al., 2002]. However, fewer than \none-half of the salespeople sampled used the technology for calendar reports. \nAdditionally, the majority of the applications of the SFA reporting technology \nwere initiated by companies rather than by salespeople. This was because, \nWidmier et al argued, the sales managers saw the SFA technology as a \u201c\u2026 \nvery useful tool in managing the sales force\u201d. Less-experienced salespeople \nindicate a significantly more positive attitude toward this corporate technology \nthan more-experienced salespeople \u2013 who thought that adoption of the \ntechnology would result in a loss in employees\u201f privacy [Keillor, Bashaw, & \nPettijohn, 1997]. The authors argued that the solution to this issue was clear-\ncut: \u201cExperienced salespeople may need to be explicitly shown the connection \nbetween technology and productivity, and perhaps learn of the threat \nassociated with less-experienced salespeople who may have the ability to \nbecome competitive faster than in the past\u201d (p 217). \n \nIn contrast to this, simplified, management-focused advice, is the work of Speier \nand Venkatesh (2002) who collected survey data from 454 salespeople across \ntwo firms that had implemented SFA tools in the USA.  They found that, \nimmediately after training in the tools, salespeople had positive perceptions of \nthe technology but, six months after implementation, the technology had been \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 8 \nwidely rejected by the salespeople and, at the same time, salesperson \nabsenteeism and voluntary turnover had significantly increased.  Interview data \nindicated that the SFA tools were a primary driver for those salespeople \nchoosing to leave the two firms. Speier and Venkatesh conclude that SFA \ntechnology may alienate successful salespeople in that the technology may \nchange the salesperson\u201fs role by generating \u201c\u2026 greater internal conflict and \npower redistribution when competence\u2013destroying technologies are \nimplemented\u2026 managers can quickly and easily assess the number of, \nfrequency of, and time allocated to sales call, which results in increased \nmonitoring\u2026 which increases the power differential between manager and \nsalesperson in favour of the manager\u201d (p110). The implication is that successful \nSFA implementations need to be carefully thought-through in terms of the \n\u201cknock-on\u201d implications. Speier and Venkatesh thus develop the issue of the \n\u201clogic of opposition\u201d raised by Robey and Boudreau (1999) in their analysis of \nthe organizational consequences of information technology interventions. \nSviokla (1996) investigated the use of an expert system designed to support the \ninsurance sales process at four insurance companies. Before the system was \nintroduced sales agents \u201coften \u201eowned\u201f the clients and successfully took their \nbusiness as they moved from one firm to another\u201d.  After the system was \nintroduced, all the detailed client data were fed straight to the home office and \nso \u201cthe company adopting the system could track its salespeople at a higher \nlevel of detail\u2026\u201d (p32). Sviokla concludes that successful implementations were \nconsiderate of political ramifications of the adoption of technological innovation \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 9 \n[Sviokla, 1996]. Therefore, a prime management task is to motivate salespeople \nto share  knowledge and insight with their peers [Desouzza, 2003]. \n \nBy contrast with this focus on the role of the individual salesperson in SFA \nadoption, other, more general, studies of information systems adoption and \nCRM have focussed on organizational-level variables [e.g., Ragowsky, Stern, \n&Adams, 2000; Jones et al, 2002] and the sophistication of management of \ninformation systems to organizational structure and performance [Raymond, \nPare, & Bergeron, 1995].  Others have found that the effective use and \nsophistication of CRM is achieved by matching organizational capabilities to \nmarket context - rather than by an uncritical adoption and development of \nsystems [Ryals and Knox, 2001].  Indeed, such systems need to be strategically \norientated and integrated with an organization\u201fs competitive strategy [Erffmeyer \nand Johnson, 2001]. \n \nThe research reported in the present study investigates the current usage and \nsophistication (evaluated as a count of the number of types of results of sales \ncampaigns that are measured) of SFA in the UK financial services industry, and \nreports on potential strategic and organizational barriers to its sophisticated \nimplementation. Overall, the importance of contextual factors on SFA use and \nsophistication has been strongly supported empirically.  However, as we have \nreviewed, within specific studies of levels of SFA adoption, the research focus \nhas, to date, been at the level of the individual adopter \u2013 often the salesperson \n\u2013 rather than at the level of the organization. These studies indicate that \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 10 \nadoption of SFA systems are driven by managerial imperatives \u2013 such as cost \ncontrol and the wish to control and manage the salesforce - and that, \nsubsequently, usage of adopted systems may be resisted by the sales force. \nThis extant research focus on the salesperson and his\/her level of adoption of \nSFA contrasts with the conclusions of the literature on the organizational \ncontext for the adoption of marketing and sales information systems in the \nfinancial services industry, reviewed earlier. There, the conclusion was that \norganizational barriers are likely to be a particular problem. For this reason, the \npresent study is focused at the level of the organization - and studies the effects \nof selected strategic and organization variables on the sophistication of SFA. \nDoes the study of organizational-level variables aid our understanding of SFA \nsophistication? This is the issue addressed in this paper. \n \nConceptual Model \nThe research reported in this paper measures a number of organizational and \nstrategic variables and relates them to SFA sophistication - evaluated as a \ncount of the number of types of results of sales campaigns that are measured .  \nOur focus is on understanding the way in which internal strategic and \u201epeople\u201f \nissues relate to SFA sophistication.   \n \nIt has been argued that the capability of firms to enter the strategic IT phase will \ndepend on three elements: (1) their existing level of IT operations, and the (2) \nstrategic and (3) organizational context within which decisions are made and \nimplemented.  The strategic context relates to a number of variables that reflect \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 11 \nthe ability of the firm to think and act strategically.  The organizational context \nrelates to these factors which will inhibit or support such a strategic orientation \nand reflects the past experiences and organizational learning that has taken \nplace, as well as the structures created to manage operations. In this paper, the \nstrategic context variables studied were the strategic importance of sales \ndecisions and the strategic integration of IT and sales. The organizational \ncontext (particularly relating to IT and marketing) included customer information \norientation and degree of both organizational slack and control.  \n \nOur analysis of the relevance of these five variables to the sophistication of SFA \nis detailed in the next section. A subsequent section details both our research \nmodel and the nature of our sample of the UK financial services sector. \n \nStrategic Context Variables  \nStrategic importance and integration \nThe successful strategic application of IT requires not only a recognition of the \nstrategic importance of certain functional decisions but also the integration of \nbusiness and IT strategy and a common understanding of aims, objectives and \nneeds from users and suppliers of the IT system [Venkatraman, 1994]. \nOrganisations with little integration of  IS strategy with business strategy have a \ngreater likelihood of implementation difficulties [Baets, 1992].  Thus, for \nsuccessful deployment of sophisticated SFA, functional areas should, \nthemselves, be involved in the strategic planning process [Hammer & \nMangurian, 1987; Venkatraman, 1994] and so, in the context of SFA \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 12 \napplications, marketing and IT investment decisions should be linked and \nintegrated. If competitive advantage is to be secured from IT and SFA then \ninformation strategies need to be developed in the same process and at the \nsame time as the business strategy, and given a high importance. In the \nfinancial services industry, this is far from being the norm [Wright & Donaldson, \n2002]. \n \nThe integration of marketing and IT personnel into \u201estrategic\u201f activities and \ndecisions, is thus likely to increase the probability that an IT-based sales \nstrategy, such as SFA, is implemented in the form of sophisticated systems. \n \nOrganizational Context Variables \nInformation Orientation \nThe interaction of people, information, and technology establishes an \norientation towards the use of information within a company, which in turn may \naffect business performance [Marchand,  Kettinger, &Rollins, 2001]. This \nconcept measures how key individuals in an organizsation possess the \ncapabilities associated with effective use of the data they have collected. We \ndefine information orientation as information sophistication, linked to the ease of \nuse and capabilities of systems, and is a holistic view of effective information \nuse.  [Sinkula, 1994] sees organizational learning as the acquisition, distribution \nand interpretation of knowledge. Our own conceptualisation of information \norientation has similarities with the concept of IT maturity and the ability of \nsystems to provide relevant and sophisticated information. A high degree of \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 13 \ninformation orientation thus represents the progress of the IT function into the \nstrategic IT era [Sabherwal & Vijayasarathy, 1994] and as having the orientation \nnecessary to support a strategic marketing application such as SFA. A strong \ninformation orientation is, therefore, a necessary but not sufficient underpinning \nto a strong customer orientation.  \n \nOrganizational slack and control \nOrganizational slack is a term first coined by Cyert and March (1963) and can \nbe defined as the degree to which uncommitted resources are available to an \norganization. Slack helps individuals by influencing the perception of availability \nof knowledge, resources and opportunities and hence encourages higher levels \nof sophistication in adoption. This situation can lead to excesses however, \nresulting in the demand for more organizational control. In a control \nenvironment, financial and performance management systems are used to \nensure that IS activities are effective and efficient.  Whereas, in the slack \nenvironment, sophisticated controls are absent and more resources are \navailable than are strictly necessary to get the job done.     \n \nNolan (1979) pointed out that the balance of these two variables is important in \nunderstanding the stage of organizational learning that the organization has \nreached with regard to its IT development.  Individuals\u201f perceptions of the \nbalance of these two variables will be key variables in understanding personal \nintention and behaviour [Ajzen, 1991] and has been shown to be relevant in the \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 14 \nacceptance of information systems [Mathieson, 1991; Taylor & Todd, 1995; \nVenkatesh, 2000].  \nOur Research Model \nTo recap, our broader research question is to evaluate the two strategic and the \nthree organizational variables as predictors of SFA sophistication. Our \nResearch Model is given in Figure 1. In this model, we show that the increasing \nstrategic importance of sales and the increasing integration of IT and sales will \nboth act to increase the information orientation of the firm. Additionally, \nincreases in the strategic importance attached to sales decisions will also \nimpact the integration of IT and sales. Also, increases in organisational slack \nand decreases in organisational control will act to increase both the firm\u201fs \ninformation orientation and the integration of IT and sales. Finally, increases in \nthe information orientation of the firm will impact on the level of sophistication of \ninformation held on customers - evaluated as a count of the number of types of \nresults of sales campaigns that are measured. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 1 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nResearch Methodology and sample characteristics \nOur study focuses on a single information intensive industry, financial services \nand a particular sales application of IT, SFA. Our measures examine both the \ntechnology of SFA and the information that is contained within SFA systems to \nsupport the activities of the salesforce. Intuitively, it would seem that \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 15 \nrespondents in information intensive industries would have more fully thought \nthrough their opinions on enabling factors in the deployment of IT for strategic \nadvantage [cf Sabherwal  & Kirs, 1994]. As in the current study, Sabherwal and \nKirs selected an information intensive industry to increase the likelihood that the \nissues addressed were important to the respondents. It has been argued that \nfocussing on a single industry, within a common environment, controls for \nexternal influences [Child & Smith, 1987] and enhances internal validity. Our \nquestionnaire items was pre-tested within qualitative interviews with consultants \nfrom IBM and Merial about the changing role of salespeople and the way in \nwhich salespeople add value in the new information age. \n \nOur study is based on a quantitative survey of a sample of named sales and \nmarketing managers in all UK banks, building societies and insurance \ncompanies taken from the Marketing Manager Yearbook 2001 [AP Information \nServices, 2001]. We used secondary sources to identify firms that were fund \nmanagers, pension houses, and head-office operations, and who did not have a \nfield sales force. Merchant banks and some stockbrokers were also deliberately \nremoved from the list since they, too, have no dedicated sales forces. One \nhundred and forty two companies were finally selected \u2013 based on our own \njudgment \u2013 that would have a sizeable sales force.  Next, telephone contact \nwas established to ensure that the companies had a sales force and to ensure \nthe contact was current and relevant. After follow up phone calls and one repeat \nmailing, 72 usable responses to our mailed questionnaire were received. The \nsample response rate was compared to the industry structure and found to be \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 16 \nrepresentative of the industry \u2013 whilst favoring larger firms with a substantial \nsales presence. We found no differences in the sales-force size profiles of early \nand late respondents. Respondents were the Marketing or Sales \nDirector\/Manager. Table 1, below, gives a summary of the nature of our \nobtained sample. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 1 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nOur information sophistication measure counted the number of types of results \nof sales campaigns that are measured by a firm. The exact questions used are \ngiven in Appendix 1. In our UK-based study, the American term \u201cSales Force \nAutomation\u201d was replaced by the UK term \u201cSales Information System\u201d \u2013 since \npre-testing revealed that the latter term was the common parlance for SFA in \nthe UK. We evaluated adoption of SIS\/SFA by asking the respondent two linked \nquestions: \n \n1 A Sales Information System has been defined as \u201cthe collection of \ninformation to assist the sales and customer management process.  Do \nyou have a Sales Information System?    \nYes \/ No \n \n2 Do you have an automated (computer-based) Sales Information System? \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 17 \n \n Yes \/ No \n \n \nAlmost all of our 72 firms claimed to be using some form of automated sales \ninformation system. These systems are now widely available and used by \nfinancial services companies.  In our sample 92% had some form of system and \n89% claimed to have an automated SIS. The average time they had been using \nsuch systems was seven years.  The level of perceived sophistication was \nhowever, found to be variable.  Using the 7-point scale, ranging from 1 \u201clow \nlevel\u201d, most perceived themselves as about 4 (mean 4.03, standard deviation \n1.65). Our subsequent analysis focuses on the total sample of 72 firms who, to \ndiffering degrees, measured the results of sales campaigns \n \nMeasurement of Strategic and Organisational Variables \nThe scale development methodology is detailed in [Fletcher and Wright 1997]. \nIn that study, question development was focussed on issues to do with the \nuptake of database marketing (DBM). In the present study, we utilize the same \nscales but alter the wording of specific questions to address SFA  - rather than \nDBM - contextual issues. Because of these slight changes, we present, in the \ncurrent paper, in-sample reliability estimates for the altered scales.  \n \nStrategic Importance and Integration \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 18 \nAppendix 2 details our measures of: (1) the strategic importance of sales \ndecisions and (2) the strategic integration of IT and sales.  Cronbach Alphas \n(conducted in-sample) were 0.58 and 0.79 for the two scales, respectively. \n[Fletcher and Wright\u201fs 1997] Alphas were 0.64 and 0.71, respectively. \n \nInformation Orientation  \nOur measure of information orientation is also detailed in Appendix 2.  The in-\nsample Cronbach Alpha was 0.89. [Fletcher and Wright\u201fs 1997] Alpha was 0.87. \n \nSlack and Control \nOur measure of organizational control is detailed in Appendix 2.  The in-sample \nCronbach Alpha was 0.82. Our measure of organizational slack is also given in \nAppendix 2.  The in-sample Cronbach Alpha was 0.86. [Fletcher and Wright\u201fs \n1997] Alphas were 0.85 and 0.66, respectively. \n \nFindings \nTable 3 sets out our samples obtained means and standard deviations on our \nmeasures, together with minimum and maximum possible scores on each \nmeasure, where appropriate. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 3 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 19 \nFocusing on those scores that were in the top quartile of the possible scores on \neach scale, then, in general, our sample perceived: the strategic importance of \nsales decisions; the strategic integration of IT and sales; and their information \norientation as, either, very important or very high.  \n \n \nGoodness of Fit of the Research Model \nThe traditional measure of model fit is the X2 value and its associated \nconfidence level. While no consensus exist on the sufficiency of a single index \nto define model quality, using several indicators together are considered to be \nan accurate reflection of overall model fit [Bollen, 1989; Kaplan, 2000]. \nTherefore, several disparate indices were used, as suggested by [Tanaka \n1993], to converge on an overall assessment, including the root mean squared \nerror of approximation [Steiger, 1990], normed fit index [Bentler & Bonnet, \n1980], the incremental fit index [Bollen, 1989], the comparative fit index [Bentler, \n1990] and goodness of fit index [Joreskog & Sorbom, 1981]. Our obtained \nvalues are given in Table 4. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 4 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nAs summarized in Table 4, the hypothesized model holds up well when tested \nagainst the sample of 72 UK financial service respondents. The X2 value is not \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 20 \nstatistically significant with 4 degrees of freedom1 and X2 value (5.61) is close \nto degrees of freedom (4), which suggests a good fit. The root mean squared \nerror of approximation is 0.075, which suggests a good fit since it is below the \ncritical point 0.08 as suggested by [Browne and Cudeck 1989]. Further, the \nnormed fit index, the comparative fit index, the incremental fit index, and the \ngoodness of fit index are all between 0.93 and 0.98, suggesting that the \nresearch model fits the observed data well. Once the fit between the \nhypothesized model and the observed data is found to be acceptable as shown \nabove, individual paths using structural equation models can then be interpreted \nto evaluate the strength and significance of these relationships as discussed in \ndetail below. \n \nHypothesis tests \nWhen an obtained t-value exceeds |\u00b11.96|, it means that the hypothesis is \nsignificant at the 5% level of significance. This method is valid subject to the \ncondition that our sample is large. In practice, it is often difficult to know whether \nour samples are so large that these large sample approximates are valid. \nHowever, the approximation is usually good for samples larger than 30 [Cramer, \n1946]. Because our analysis is based on 72 UK finance service respondents, \nthe statistical inference is appropriate.    \n \n                                                 \n1\n Given that the null hypothesis in the X\n2\n test is that there is no difference between the covariance matrix \npredicted by the model and the observed data, an insignificant result suggests a perfect fit. \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 21 \nEquation 1 in Table 5 shows that the values of t with organizational slack \n(OSTOT) and integration of IT and sales (SITOT) are larger than the 1.96 which \nleads to the conclusion that the higher organizational slack and integration of IT \nand sales, the higher level of information orientation (IOTOT) exists (hypothesis \n2 and hypothesis 4). Equation 2 in Table 5 shows that the value of t obtained for \nstrategic importance of sales (SINTOT) is larger than the 1.96 and \ndemonstrates that increasing strategic importance of sales leads to increasing \nintegration of IT and sales, supporting hypothesis 5. From equation 3 in Table 5, \nthe obtained t-value of level of information orientation is larger than 1.96. The \nresult indicates that increasing information orientation leads to increasing \nsophistication of information held on customers (MTI2), (hypothesis).  \n \nIn this study, we also want to investigate if level of information sophistication \nmediates the relationship between (i) strategic importance of sales, (ii) \norganizational slack, (iii) organizational control, and (iv) integration of IT, with \nsophistication of information held on customers. Our analysis demonstrates that \ninformation orientation mediates the relationship between organizational slack \nand sophistication of information held on customers.  Although information \norientation does solely mediate the relationship between strategic importance of \nsales and sophistication of information held on customers, we obtain an indirect \neffect of strategic importance of sales on information orientation. This indirect \neffect is mediated through integration of IT and this effect, finally, impacts on the \nsophistication of information held on customers. In all pathways, information \norientation is critical as a mediating variable that exerts the only direct influence \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 22 \non the sophistication of information held on customers. Table 6 details the \nresults of our hypothesis testing and Figure 2 presents our obtained model. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 5 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 6 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Figure 2 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nIn short, our modelling investigation reveals that information orientation was \nidentified as the direct predictor of the sophistication of information held on \ncustomers. But information orientation mediates the effects of (i) organizational \nslack, (ii) strategic importance of IT and sales, and (iii) integration of IT and \nsales. Why should this be the case? What was the variability, between our \nsampled financial services firms, in terms of information sought - and held - on \ndeployed SFA systems? Would this, post-hoc, investigation provide us with any \ncloser understanding of our major finding? To answer these questions, we \nlooked, in detail, at some basic data that we collected from our respondents at \nthe time of our main survey. Whilst our respondents, sales managers and \ndirectors, have strong aspirations for their adopted SFA (as shown in Table 7, \nbelow) the information held or desired to be held (as shown in Tables 8, 9, 10, \nand 11, also below) cannot, we assert, fulfil these aspirations. In short, as we \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 23 \nshall see, our respondents claim to be sophisticated in their use of SFA \napplications, but yet, in an absolute sense, they are not. In the next section, we \ndocument a disconnect between what our SFA users consider to be \nsophisticated and what these same SFA users could be doing with their \ninstalled systems. \n \nBasic data on our respondents\u201f installed SFA systems \n \nRespondents were asked how important certain objectives were for their SIS. \nTable 7 shows means and standard deviations for these objectives on a scale \nfrom one, not at all important to seven, crucially important. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 7 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nAs Table 7 reveals, the purpose of these systems appears quite general with \nmost respondents claiming to use them for customer acquisition, customer \nretention, improved customer relationships and contact management \nintegration.  Further analysis clarifies this result however.  As we saw, earlier - \nin the subsection SFA usage and sophistication \u2013 our sales and marketing \ndirectors perceive that their systems operate at about a mid-level of \nsophistication (an obtained  mean of 4.03 with a standard deviation of 1.65 \nusing a 7-point scale ranging from 1 \u201clow level\u201d 7 \u201chigh level\u201d). But further \ninvestigation indicates that this perception may be misplaced. Table 8 shows \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 24 \nthat the installed SFA systems hold a paucity of information to manage \ncustomer relationships. \n \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 8 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nFor example, although most measure the number of sales generated, the \nnumber of customers gained, revenue increases and opportunities identified, \nrelatively few measure more problematic areas such as individual customer \nvalue, share of customer business, effectiveness of different marketing mix \nelements or efficiency of different customer conduct strategies.  About 40 per \ncent do not measure customer satisfaction at all and only about 30 per cent \nattempt to predict customer potential.  Costs per customer and costs per sale \nare also not measured by 50 per cent of the sample.  Even more surprising is \nthe low level, less than 40 per cent of the sample, who measure the degree of a \nrelationship enhancement. Clearly, the objectives set for the SFA cannot be met \nby the results that are, in fact, measured by the sample of financial services \nfirms.  Table 9 further clarifies this inference. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 9 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nAs Table 9 reveals, sales and marketing managers generally feel they have \nadequate information and at least 50 per cent of the sample do not see the \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 25 \nneed for any more.  But both the quantity and quality of information held is at a \nlow level of complexity.  As expected, almost all hold name, address and \ntelephone number but far fewer have fax, email or the names of different \ncontacts with customers. Table 10 shows the extent to which different types of \ndata are held. \n \nIn terms of data that would really make a difference in the strategic use of SFA \n\u2013 such as purchasing profiles, competitor products or services held and \nprevious contact records \u2013 the data held by the financial services organizations \nare relatively sparse. \nRespondents were next asked the degree to which they used SFA for aspects \nof sales planning on a scale from one, \u201enot at all\u201f to seven \u201ecomprehensively\u201f.  \nTable 9 sets out the findings. \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 10 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n \nAs Table 10 reveals, SFA systems are being used extensively in sales planning \nfor a variety of purposes but, as expected at this stage in the presentation of the \nresults of our research, the major use is to develop mailing lists. Table 10 \naddresses the degree to which respondents utilised SFA for operational uses - \nusing the same response scale as in Table 7. \n \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 26 \nAs Table 11 shows, the strongest use is made of SFA for contact management \nand sales cycle tracking but very little use is made of SFA for ordering or billing. \nRemarkably, customer care is not a major use of the SFA in operational terms \u2013 \nscoring less than half-way up the seven-point scale from not at all to \ncomprehensively. \n \n \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nInsert Table 11 about here \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nDiscussion \nOverall, our research investigated the extent to which a range of strategic and \norganizational context variables would differentiate financial services firms who \nhave SFA systems of varying degrees of sophistication. However, in contrast to \nour expectations, differences in the degree of sophistication of currently \ninstalled SFA systems are linked to the direct influence of one variable only \u2013 \ninformation orientation. Recall that we defined information orientation as \ninformation sophistication, linked to the ease of use and capabilities of systems. \nAdditionally, our results contain a host of contradictions: whilst our respondents, \nsales managers and directors, have strong aspiration for their adopted SFA, the \ninformation held or desired to be held does not \/will not\/ fulfil this aspiration. The \npaucity of information held, indirectly confirms and extends the research of \nWidmier, Jackson and McCabe [Widmier, et al., 2002], discussed earlier, on the \nreluctance of salespeople to populate SFA systems with data \u2013 which \nsuggested that salesperson resistance to SFA is a critical issue in achieving the \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 27 \noperational deployment of sophisticated SFA.  Our research review, presented \nearlier, suggested that barriers to new technology adoption have often been \nseen as related to the lack of user friendly software, or technical difficulties in \nmatching databases, but recent technological development suggest this is less \nlikely to be the case in practice. Previous research has shown that \norganisational and strategic barriers were seen by respondents in financial \nservices firms as less important than technological barriers for less \nsophisticated information systems [Fletcher & Wright, 1995], but as \nsophistication increased these were expected to become more critical. In the \ncurrent study, we have documented that most UK financial services firms now \nhave SFA systems, but, despite this, their ability to deploy currently installed \nsystems in a truly sophisticated, strategic way in order to meet our respondents\u201f \nespoused strategic goals is, in fact, moot.  \n \nSalespeople are often the primary source of information within a customer\/seller \nrelationship and thus play a critical role in successfully building relationships. \nThe amount and type of information considered as necessary for a SFA system \nwill be determined by the customer orientation strategy of the firm [Lambe & \nSpekman, 1997] but in our findings this does not relate to sophistication. Our \nfinding that information orientation is the primary driver of SFA \u201csophistication\u201d \u2013 \nand that this sophistication is of a low actual level - implies that financial \norganisations have progressed further in their acquisition of technological \ncapability than in their strategic or organisational thinking. This inference is \nsupported by the work of Fletcher and Wright (1996) who studied the strategic \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 28 \ncontext for information systems use in the UK financial services industry. Using \na sample of 46 per cent of all major banks, building societies and insurance \ncompanies, they found a good degree of integration of marketing and IT \nfunctional groupings with the firm-wide strategic planning process but, at the \nsame time, documented a high degree of strategic ambiguity and lack of \nstrategic time frame for such investment decisions. These results, coupled with \na general reliance on traditional cost benefit appraisal methods were, they \nargued, indicative of a short-term, rather than strategic, focus for information \nsystems use. Fletcher and Wright argued that, within the UK financial services \nindustry, the strategic vision did not exist to enable the majority of those firms \nadopting information systems to support marketing to gain sustainable strategic \nadvantage. \n \nThe current study suggests that the UK financial services industry\u201fs present \napproach to level of SFA adoption and deployment \u2013 without an underpinning \ncustomer focus \u2013 strongly implies an alternative focus on improving technical \ncapabilities of IT systems, perhaps for managing the salesforce, rather than \naiding the sales force to enhance their capability to achieve sales. Our \ndocumentation of the paucity of information held on the installed SFA systems \nstrongly implies that the sale force resistance to such systems - as documented \nby [Speier and Venkatesh 2002] and described earlier \u2013 may also be descriptive \nof the UK financial services industry. \n \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 29 \nAutomating a sales force is a two-stage process. First, the strategic decision to \nadopt the new system must be made, and previous research suggests this is \noften done on a \u201ecopycat\u201f basis rather than with a clear strategic aim. Second, \nthe system has to be used and implemented by the end-users, in this case \nindividual salespeople. It is in this second stage that our findings suggest errors \nare likely to be made which may lead to failure. While the initial decision is an \norganizational context, the latter stage is much more on an individual basis \u2013 \nwhere the individual salesperson is required to become involved in populating \nthe database with information. Our research therefore supports the views of \nParthasarathy and Sohi (1997) that this \u201cdual adoption\u201d is a critical factor to \nachieve strategic usage. What they call \u201enon monetary\u201f costs of adoption will \nneed to be considered to ensure the second stage of adoption is successful.  \n \nImplications for Management and Research  \nClearly, management and motivation of sales staff is likely to be a key \ncomponent in the future development\/deployment of SFA, as identified earlier \n[Robey & Bourdreau, 1999; Speier & Venkatesh, 2002; Sviokla, 1996]. Our \nfindings show that a managerially-focused, information orientation to \nsophistication in adoption may lead to sales force resistance \u2013 as documented \nin prior studies of sales force reaction to SFA implementations, discussed \nearlier. It follows that those firms wanting the most from SFA may be most apt \nto fail, as in, for example, the pitfalls of customer relationship management \n(CRM) innovations that have tried to build relationships with disinterested \ncustomers [Rigby, Reicheld, & Schefter, 2002]. These customers, subsequently, \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 30 \nturned into vociferous critics of such ill-thought implementations. Best practice \nin CRM has been reviewed elsewhere [Zeithaml, Rust, & Lemon, 2001] \n \nThe findings put forward in this paper suggest that research in SFA needs to \nfocus on organizational issues that act to prevent employees providing data for \nuse in what have been termed \u201ccodification-strategy\u201d approaches to knowledge \nmanagement [Hansen, Nohria, & Tierney, 1999]. Here, the focus is to provide \ndatabases of knowledge - which can be assessed by anyone in the \norganization. This approach contrasts with the \u201cpersonalization-strategy\u201d \u2013 \nwhere the focus in knowledge management is on enhancing communication \nbetween i) those in the organization who would benefit from access to particular \nknowledge and ii) those who possess that knowledge.  \n \nOur current results contrast with earlier research on the adoption and \nsophistication and database marketing applications in the UK financial services \nsector. In these studies [Desai, Wright, & Fletcher, 1998; Fletcher & Wright, \n1997] it was found that increased sophistication in installed database marketing \nsystems was closely linked to a strong information orientation within the host \norganization, a large direct marketing department, and strong strategic \nintegration of IT and marketing functions. However, adoption of database \nmarketing systems was, interestingly, linked to a wider set of variables including \nstrong customer orientation, organizational slack, a large of the marketing \ndepartment, and lack of incrementalism in decision-making.  In short, a financial \nservice firm\u201fs customer orientation was seen to differentiate between users and \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 31 \nnon-users of DBM. But, significantly, DBM adoption and sophistication can be \ndriven, entirely, at a managerial level \u2013 there is no essential requirement for \nsalespeople, or others, to populate DBM systems with data, the data are \nprovided by the actions and processes of the information systems themselves. \nIn our introduction section, we reviewed the organizational context of SFA in the \nUK financial services sector. We concluded that firms, in this sector, appeared \nrelatively insensitive to the true organizational issues in the adoption of \nsophisticated IS. Organizational issues are, of course, the ones identified as \none of the four perils leading to CRM failure [Rigby, et al., 2002]. CRM, along \nwith SFA, requires organizational change enabled by employee support. Whilst \nSFA can provide a powerful enabler for CRM, it cannot automate the human \naspects of the sales function. By contrast, as we discussed earlier, DBM \nimplementation has less reliance on human compliance. \nIn summary, our current study\u201fs identification of information orientation as the \nsole direct driver of SFA \u201csophistication\u201d suggests strongly that managerial \nimperatives underpin SFA deployment within the UK financial services industry. \nThe paucity of information actually held on deployed systems suggests strongly \nthat sales-force resistance is a reaction to this managerial imperative. As such, \nour work supports the importance of earlier research on individual-level factors \nin SFA acceptance. Clearly, the study of broad range of organizational-level \ncontextual variables adds, in fact, little to our understanding of the realities of \nthe managerial priorities of our sales and marketing directors. \n \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 32 \nOur research demonstrates that the UK financial service industry\u201fs present \napproach to SFA sophistication \u2013 without an underpinning customer focus or a \nstrong focus on the human aspects of the sales function - is flawed. The paucity \nof information held on the installed system strongly implies that the sale force \nresistance to such systems may also be descriptive of the UK financial services \nindustry. It follows that future studies of SFA adoption and usage should study \nindividual-level variables such as employees\u201f trust in their organization. For \nexample, a number of studies have already acknowledged that employees\u201f trust \nis a critical variable influencing the performance, effectiveness, and efficiency of \nthe organization [Kramer & Tyler, 1996; Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998; \nMayer & Davis, 1999; Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995; Whitney, 1994]. \nEarlier research identified links between trust and a variety of work behaviours, \nincluding organizational citizenship and employees\u201f performance [Mayer & \nDavis, 1999], problem-solving [Zand, 1972], job satisfaction [Aryee, Budhwar, & \nChen, 2002; Gould-Williams, 2003], and organizational commitment [Cook & \nWall, 1980]. \ns:\\staff\\dro - durham research online\\fulltext\\departments\\business school\\5541\\salesforce automation systems.docx 33 \n References \n \nAjzen, I.
