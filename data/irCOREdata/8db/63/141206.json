Introduction \nThe global financial crisis and its consequences continue to preoccupy policymakers. Capital \nmarkets around the world have been volatile, and governments are facing the difficult task of \nfinancing the investment needs of their local economy. There is a vast body of literature on \nthe positive role of finance in economic development (Goldsmith, 1969; McKinnon, 1973; \nFry, 1988; Levine, 1992). Among the different forms of finance, equity financing is an \nimportant source, and the role of foreign investors in funding the requirements of domestic \neconomies has never been more vital. Errunza (2001) suggests that foreign equity portfolio \ninvestors have a significant positive impact on the development of local equity markets, \nwhich in turn should drive domestic economic development. Given the importance of foreign \nequity portfolio investment, it is imperative for policymakers to appreciate factors influencing \nthe country allocation decision of foreign investors. This paper investigates whether the \ninvestment decisions of foreign investors are affected by the host country-specific equity \nmarket characteristics.  \n \nThe benefits of international diversification of portfolio investment are well established (see \nGrubel, 1968; Levy and Sarnat, 1970; Solnik, 1974a; Errunza, 1977, among others). The \nInternational Capital Asset Pricing (ICAPM) model suggests that international investors \nshould hold the world market as the benchmark portfolio because it provides the best mean \nvariance efficiency (Tesar and Werner, 1995; Solnik and McLeavy, 2004; Chan et al., 2005; \nFidora et al., 2007). Studies also document the gradual removal of capital controls by \ndeveloped countries beginning in the early 1980s (French and Poterba, 1991), and by \ndeveloping countries by the late 1980s and early 1990s (Errunza, 2001; Harvey, 2003). \nHowever, despite increased access to financial markets across the globe, an extensive number \nof investigations demonstrate the prevalence of home bias, i.e., the tendency to overweight \nhome markets relative to the theoretical prescription of the ICAPM (see Cooper and \nKaplanis, 1994; Tesar and Werner, 1995; Warnock, 2001; Chan et al., 2005; Fidora et al., \n2007).  \n \nThe investigations on home bias document a number of potential barriers impeding foreign \ninvestors from holding the world market portfolio. These barriers may be direct legal \nrestrictions due to different legal status accorded to foreign and domestic investors (Bekaert, \n1995), or indirect barriers arising from differences in available information and investor \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n3 \n \nprotection (Bekaert and Harvey, 1995; Errunza, 2001; Bekaert et al., 2003; Hunter, 2006). \nSimilarly, market-specific risks, such as diversification opportunities, liquidity, transaction \ncosts and level of host market efficiency, commonly known as stock market development \nfactors, could also potentially impede foreign investment (Chan et al., 2005). However, to the \nbest of our knowledge, no empirical study has specifically documented the role of country-\nspecific equity market factors on country allocation decisions of foreign investors, except \nChan et al. (2005), who use different predetermined variables, including stock market \ndevelopment factors, to explain the issue of home and foreign bias. The persistence of home \nbias indicates that, on aggregate, foreign investors allocate a relatively large fraction of their \nwealth to domestic assets. This suggests that if we are able to control for home bias, we \nshould be able to explain the role of different country-specific equity market characteristics in \nexplaining bilateral cross-country foreign equity country allocation.   \n \nChan et al. (2005) note that a major factor limiting research on foreign equity portfolio \ninvestment is the lack of cross-border holdings data. We make use of the recently available \nIMF\u2019s Co-ordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) foreign equity portfolio holding \ndata\n1\n. Similarly, as Chan et al. (2005) state, most existing studies are from the perspective of \nU.S. investors, and they leave the question open of whether the explanations for a wide cross-\nsection of other source countries are similar or not. Furthermore, a very small number of \nexisting studies, which use multiple source and host countries in their sample, only \ninvestigate the investments from developed countries into other developed countries. Since \nthe U.S. and other developed countries\u2019 equity markets exhibit higher levels of development \nrelative to emerging markets, it remains to be tested whether the inclusion of the latter \nmarkets as host countries along with developed markets yields similar results.   \n \nOur study makes three important contributions to the literature. First, we try to explain the \nrole of country-specific equity market characteristics in explaining the cross-sectional and \ntemporal variation of foreign equity country allocation. Apart from Gelos and Wei (2005), \nwho use emerging markets only and focus on transparency measures, and Chan et al. (2005), \nwho explain foreign bias, no study has undertaken comprehensive empirical investigation \nmodelling cross-country allocations. Second, as noted earlier, despite the theoretical \nsuggestions of the ICAPM, global investors do not hold the world market as their benchmark \n                                           \n1\n Fidora et al., (2007) use the same dataset using the average over the period of 2001-2003 and demonstrate the \nrole of exchange rate risk in explaining bilateral home bias. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n4 \n \nportfolio. The ICAPM makes a number of assumptions, such as that global financial markets \nare perfectly integrated and fully efficient, investors incur no transaction costs, purchasing \npower parity perfectly holds and there are no barriers to international investments. Most of \nthe earlier studies on international investments offer abstract theoretical explanations of why \nforeign investors may not hold the world market portfolio (see Solnik, 1974b; Black, 1974; \nSercu, 1980; Stulz, 1981a,b; Adler and Dumas, 1983; Errunza and Losq, 1985; Eun and \nJanakiramanan, 1986; Cooper and Kaplanis, 1986, 1994). The majority of the equilibrium \nframeworks suggest that the violation of unrealistic ICAPM assumptions, which create \ncosts\/risks for global investors, should explain the under- or over-weighting of foreign \ncountries relative to ICAPM\u2019s weightings. However, empirical evidence modelling the \nviolations of the underlying assumptions is scarce and limited by the unavailability of high \nquality data. We fill the gap by using different proxies of the underlying assumptions to \nmodel cross-country allocation. \n \nFinally, we pool bilateral data from 36 countries, developed and developing, spanning a \nperiod of nine years (2001-2009), with more than 500 cross-section units yielding \napproximately 4,600 observations. Such a comprehensive dataset with wide cross-sectional \nand temporal variation affords us the statistical confidence to test our hypotheses using panel \ndata econometric estimations. Baltagi (1995) demonstrates that, compared to purely cross-\nsection data, panel data set-up supplies more information, more variability, less colllinearity, \ngreater degrees of freedom and higher statistical efficiency, yielding reliable parameter \nestimates. Moreover, the application of fixed effect panel data model controls for individual \nheterogeneity; studies not controlling for unit-specific effects run the risk of producing biased \nestimates. Furthermore, and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the \nimpact of the 2007-08 global financial crisis on portfolio holdings, country allocations and \nparameter stability.\n2\n \n \nThe findings show that country-specific equity market factors, particularly market size, \nliquidity (level of market efficiency) and transaction costs, are the key factors influencing the \ncountry allocation decisions of foreign equity portfolio investors. We demonstrate that \ncountry-specific equity market characteristics, predominantly stock market development \nfactors, explain almost 54% of the total variation in foreign equity portfolio allocations.

Section 2 briefly explains the theoretical \nframework underlying our empirical analysis and provides a detailed discussion of the \nvariables used. Section 3 reports and discusses empirical results and section 4 concludes the \npaper.  \n \n2. Theoretical framework and data  \nWe follow the theoretical framework developed by Cooper and Kaplanis (1986). A simple \nprescription of their framework modelling portfolio allocation, based on ICAPM context, is \nas follows:  \n \n \n \nwhere wijt is the weight (allocation) of foreign equity portfolio investors of country i invested \nin equities of country j for the time period t. For the same period,  is the benchmark \nweight, i.e. the proportion of the world market capitalisation accounted by country j\u2019s equity \nmarket as prescribed by the ICAPM.  is the proportion of total world equity wealth owned \nby country i in the time period t.  is the deadweight cost to investors of country i for \nholding the equities in country j for the period t.  is the given level of variance of the \nequities\u2019 return and h is the langrange multiplier of an objective function which maximises \nthe equities\u2019 returns for the given level of variance (for the objective function and detailed \nderivation, please see Cooper and Kaplanis, 1986). Clearly, if there are no costs, i.e.  is \nzero, all investors should hold is the . However, in the presence of deadweight costs, the \nabove relationship shows that the greater the deadweight cost is ( ), the lower the \nallocation will be from investors of country i into country j relative to the suggestion of the \nICAPM. In the following sections we first describe the proxy of foreign equity portfolio \nallocations (i.e. ), followed by the direct and indirect investment barriers that may \npotentially influence the country allocation decision of foreign investors (i.e. ). \n \n  (1)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n6 \n \n2.1 Measure of bilateral foreign equity portfolio allocation \nThe main dependent variable in all our regressions is the logarithmic value of portfolio \nallocations ( ) from country i into equities of country j, where portfolio allocations ( ) \nare defined as: \n \n \nDrawing on our theoretical framework (see equation 1),  is the weight of foreign equity \ninvestment from investors of country i into equities of country j for year t, and FPIijt is the \nactual foreign portfolio investment (stock of holdings) in USD millions. Our bilateral data on \nthe 36 recipients or host countries (see Table 1 below) is from the International Monetary \nFund (IMF).  \n \nThe Co-ordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) of the IMF provides detailed and \nbilateral country-by-country foreign equity portfolio holding data. Most of the investments in \nthe survey are from developed countries into other developed markets. The stock holding of \ndeveloping countries is negligible. For this reason, we consider only developed countries as \nsource countries.\n3\n The number of investor or source countries is 16 (Australia, Austria, \nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, \nNorway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States). Following other \nstudies (see Chan et al., 2005 and Fidora et al., 2007), we too exclude offshore financial \ncentres, such as Luxembourg, which are considered tax havens.  \n \nTable 1 presents the sample averages of foreign portfolio equity allocation (in percentage) \nreceived by all the host countries j for the nine-year period 2001-2009. As seen from the \nsecond column, Peru received the lowest allocation (0.02%), whereas investors\u2019 most \nfavoured destination is the United States, with the highest allocation of 36.25%. The top ten \n                                           \n3\n In terms of coverage of the survey, most of the financial market participants included in the survey are, but are \nnot limited to, the primary end-investors (e.g. banks, security dealers, pension funds, insurance companies, \nmutual funds, non-financial corporations, households) and primary custodians who hold or manage securities on \nbehalf of others. However, some caveats deserve due attention in using the data. Any investment below USD \n500,000 is not reported. In addition, some data, despite being available, may not be reported by a country for \nconfidentiality reasons. \n \n  (2)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n7 \n \ncountries in terms of allocation are all developed markets (the United States, the United \nKingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, Finland and Canada), \nwhereas nine of the bottom ten are developing countries (Argentina, Chile, the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, Malaysia, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand and Poland). \n \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 1 about here.............. \n \n \n2.2 Country-specific equity market proxies \nAs our investigation underscores the importance of country-specific equity market \ncharacteristics, we first describe proxies of country-specific equity market factors, followed \nby the control variables. We use five different variables to capture key equity market \nfeatures.\n4\n The first variable (Stock market size) encapsulates the relative breadth (size) of the \nequity market, reflecting the significance of the capital market in the economy. Levine and \nZervos (1996) claim that developed markets, which are bigger in size, are better at mobilising \ncapital and diversifying risk. Bekaert and Harvey (2000) and Chan et al. (2005) suggest that \nforeign investors tend to allocate more wealth to bigger and developed markets. Similarly, \nChan et al. (2005) conjecture that bigger stock markets are more visible, more recognised and \nmore developed, and therefore are able to attract more foreign equity portfolio investment. \nFollowing Levine and Zervos (1996) and Chan et al. (2005), we add the logarithmic ratio of \nstock market capitalisation to GDP as a measure of stock market size. This variable is \nsourced from the World Development Indicator (WDI) of the World Bank. Table 1 (column \n3) shows that the top ten countries ranking against this measure are all developed markets, \nwith the exception of Chile, Malaysia and Taiwan. Similarly, the bottom ten countries \ngenerally represent emerging markets, with the exception of Austria, Italy, New Zealand and \nPortugal. The regression coefficient on this variable should carry a positive sign. \n \nThe next two variables we use are the proxies that capture relative development of the market \nmicrostructure. In a relatively more developed market, transaction costs would be lower. \nSolnik and McLeavey (2004) argue that the effect of transaction costs is often neglected in \ninternational portfolio management. They claim that the impact of transaction costs should be \n                                           \n4\n We also consider number of listed companies scaled by total population and trade volume scaled by GDP as \nalternative measures. However, because these measures are highly correlated with stock market development \nand turnover ratio, we do not include them since they do not add any additional information. However, when \nregressed individually both these measures are highly significant in all our regressions. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n8 \n \nintegrated in active global portfolio management, as these vary significantly amongst \ndifferent countries. Higher transaction costs may reduce the expected return and diminish the \nbenefits of global diversification; therefore, the effect of transaction costs should be a key \nconsideration, particularly when investing in emerging markets. Keim and Madhavan (1995), \nwho highlight the importance of transaction costs in determining investment performance, \nalso suggest that transaction costs may materially lower the expected value of an investment \nstrategy which otherwise may appear lucrative. Similarly, Rowland (1999) shows the inverse \nrelationship between higher transaction costs and benefits of international portfolio \ndiversification. Furthermore, De Roon et al. (2001) demonstrate that for U.S. investors \ninvesting in emerging markets, the diversification benefits become smaller when short selling \nand transaction costs constraints are incorporated. Similarly, studies investigating the \nassociation between transaction costs and asset pricing generally conjecture that equities with \nhigher transaction costs trade at lower prices compared to their expected cash flows (see \nAmihud and Mendelson, 1986; Brennan and Subrahmanyam, 1996; Datar et al., 1998).  \n \nThe available empirical findings imply that despite the inherent diversification benefit, \nforeign investors may prefer to underweight countries that have higher transaction costs. We \nuse a composite estimate of country-level transaction costs associated with trading \ninternational securities. The transaction costs variable is estimated and maintained by Elkins-\nSherry (E\/S) and documented in the yearly Global Stock Market Factbook of Standard and \nPoor (S&P). E\/S provides transaction costs analysis for global institutional investors, such as \npension funds, investment managers and other investment companies. The estimates of total \ntrading costs comprise three sub-components. The first is the average commission; the second \nis the average fee. It is worth noting that for the UK, the buying fee is significantly higher \nbecause of stamp duty. We have taken the average of the buy and sell figures, as investors \npay more for buying but are compensated significantly less for selling. The third component \nis the average cost of market impact. Market impact is the difference between the price at \nwhich a trade is executed and the average of the stock\u2019s high, low, opening and closing prices \nduring the trading period. More specifically, it is the average cost of trade versus the average \nprice. Solnik and McLeavy (2004) define market impact as the difference between the actual \nexecution cost and the price that would have prevailed in a case of no-trade by the manager. \nWe aggregate all three components of transaction costs to form a composite measure \ndenominated in basis points. As presented in Table 1 (column 4) the ten markets with the \nhighest transaction costs are all emerging markets, with the exception of Greece. The \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n9 \n \nPhilippines has the highest transaction costs, with 88 basis points (bps) per average \ntransaction. Similarly, the ten countries with the lowest transaction costs are all developed \nmarkets, with Japan having the lowest average cost of 19 bps, followed by the U.S., with 22 \nbps. In our regression, we expect this variable to bear a negative sign, since higher transaction \ncosts would be associated with lower equity portfolio allocations. \n \nFollowing Bekeart and Harvey (2000), the other microstructure variable we use captures the \nliquidity of the market. As noted earlier, studies show assets with lower liquidity trade at a \nlower price relative to their expected cash flows (Amihud and Mendelson, 1986; Brennan and \nSubrahmanyam, 1996; Datar et al., 1998). This suggests that illiquid assets demand an extra \nrisk premium and therefore should have higher expected returns, which further implies that \nforeign investors should underweight countries with illiquid markets. Bekeart et al. (2007) \nclaim that the effect of liquidity is more pronounced in emerging markets, where it takes \nconsiderable time to execute transactions. Following Levine and Zervos (1996), we use the \nturnover ratio (Market liquidity) as proxy of market liquidity. Bekaert and Hodrick (2008) \nfurther suggest that although turnover ratio is often regarded as an indicator of liquidity, it \ncan also reflect the arrival of news that instigates trades and hence is also an indirect measure \nof market efficiency. Damodaran (2010) remarks that one of the minimum requirements for a \nmarket to be efficient, with prices therefore the best estimates of true values, is that trading \nshould be inexpensive, instantaneous and easy. This conjecture again implies that liquidity \nmeasures may also reflect the degree of market efficiency. Solnik and McLeavey (2004) also \nsupport the claim the markets with a higher degree of price efficiency are associated with a \nhigher degree of liquidity. \n \nFurthermore, turnover also complements the stock market development\/size measure, given \nthe argument that a large market may not be the most active market. For example, the value \nof stocks traded in anada for the year 2006 is USD 1,290,246 million (market capitalisation \nof USD 1,700,708 million) with a turnover ratio of 81%. For the same year, the value traded \nin Sweden was almost half of that in Canada, i.e. USD 677,122 million (market capitalisation \nof USD 573,250 million), but the turnover ratio was 139%. We incorporate the average value \ntraded as a percentage of mean market capitalisation sourced from different issues of Global \nStock Market Factbook of S&P. As seen from Table 1 (column 5), the majority of the \ncountries with the highest turnover ratio are developed markets, with the exception of India, \nTaiwan and Korea. The regression coefficient is expected to take on a positive sign. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n10 \n \nWe further add two variables to reflect potential market volatility. The first variable we \ninclude is the three-year moving standard deviation (Local equity market volatility) of host \ncountry\u2019s stock market returns, constructed using the previous 60 months\u2019 total return index \ndenominated in local currency.\n5\n We obtain the monthly total return index from Morgan \nStanley Capital Investment (MSCI). Following the conceptual framework of Cooper and \nKaplanis (1986), variance negatively affects returns, suggesting foreign investors may avoid \ncountries with a certain level of volatility. As shown in column 6 of Table 1, except for \nBelgium most of the ten countries with the highest stock market volatility are emerging \nmarkets, indicating greater future uncertainty (risk) relative to developed markets. As such, \ninvestors may shy away or underweight markets with higher stock market volatility. The \nregression coefficient of this variable should carry a negative sign. \n \nSolnik and McLeavy (2004) remark that in addition to the premium demanded due to local \nmarket volatility, currency risk premium must be earned by foreign investors for bearing \nsystematic exchange rate risk which cannot be diversified away. They claim that despite \ndiversification, the world market portfolio is sensitive to foreign exchange rate risk, and \ntherefore the latter needs to be taken into consideration in international portfolio \nmanagement. Such arguments conjecture that exchange rate movements should also affect \ninvestors\u2019 decisions (see Solnik and McLeavey, 2004). Following the risk-return relationship \nargument of the ICAPM, investors should underweight countries with higher movements in \nreal exchange rate. This may be particularly important when investing in emerging markets, \nwhich experience wide swings in foreign exchange rates. As the second measure of earnings \nvolatility relevant to foreign investors, we use the three-year moving average standard \ndeviation (Exchange rate volatility) based on monthly figures of trade weighted real effective \nexchange rate (REER) variable obtained from the Bank of International Settlement (BIS). \nThe trade weighted effective exchange rate is a better indicator of the macroeconomic effects \nof exchange rates than purely a single bilateral rate (see Mark and Fung, 2006). The REER \nused in this study is the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) adjusted by relative \nconsumer prices levels. The NEER is calculated as the geometric weighted average of a \nbasket of bilateral exchange rates, which implies that variation in the REER incorporates both \n                                           \n5\n The use of local currency is dictated by theoretical consideration. Unlike local investors, foreign investors are exposed to \ntwo different types of volatility risks. The first is the risk arising from volatility in host country\u2019s equity return, which is \nborne by local and foreign investors. The second, which is only of concern to foreign investors, arises from the movement in \nthe currency exchange rate. For further details, please see Solnik and McLeavey (2004). We thank the anonymous referee for \nclarifying this issue. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n11 \n \ndevelopments in nominal exchange rate and the inflation differential vis-\u00e0-vis trading \npartners. Carrieri et al. (2006) note that the use of REER should be preferred to NEER \nbecause inflation rates are generally non-random and hence nominal exchange rate may not \nreflect the true effect of exchange rate risk. They note that because REER is measured taking \naccount of the combined effect of changes in the inflation differential and changes in nominal \ncurrency value, it is a better proxy as it captures the true effect of exchange rate risk arising \nfrom the deviation of PPP. The BIS REER basket used in this study incorporates 52 \neconomies, including emerging markets. For further details, please refer to Mark and Fung \n(2006) and Carrieri et al. (2006). The summary average for all countries over the six-year \nperiod is reported in Table 1 (column 7). The ten markets with the highest real exchange rate \nvolatility are generally found in emerging countries, with the exception of Australia, Japan \nand New Zealand. Turkey reveals the highest exchange rate volatility. On the other hand, \nnine of the ten countries with the lowest exchange rate volatility are developed markets. In \nour sample, Austria exhibits the lowest real exchange rate volatility, with 1.8% standard \ndeviation. We expect this variable to yield a negative regression coefficient. \n \n2.2 Control variables \nThe first issue to control is the widely studied home bias phenomenon. It is evident from the \nliterature (see French and Poterba, 1991; Tesar and Werner, 1995; Warnock, 2001; Karlsson \nand Norden, 2007; Chan et al., 2005; Fidora et al., 2007) that investors tend to significantly \noverweight their home market and therefore actual portfolios deviate from the theoretically \nderived world market portfolio. Chan et al. (2005) note that if foreign investors overweight \ntheir local market, then the rest of their allocation should also be disproportionately lower. \nConsequently, home bias could be an important explanatory variable for explaining foreign \nallocation. As investors deviate from holding the world market portfolio, following Fidora et \nal. (2007) we construct the following bilateral home bias (Hbiasijt) to control for the impact of \nhome bias on foreign equity allocation: \n \n \nwhere Hbiasijt is bilateral home bias observed by investor country i for country j at time t.  \nBWTijt is defined as the benchmark weight and is computed as:  \n \n  (3)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n12 \n \n \nwhere MCjt is the market capitalisation of the recipient or host country j at time t.  \n \nAs seen from column 2 of Table 2 below, all investor countries exhibit significant home bias. \nAmong the top ten countries ranking highest on the scale of Home bias, eight are developing \ncountries (Argentina, Chile, China, India, Malaysia, Peru, the Philippines and Taiwan) and \ntwo are developed countries (Canada and New Zealand). This shows that investors manifest \nhome bias not only towards developing countries but also towards developed countries, \nsuggesting a strong rationale for controlling the impact of the domestic bias on foreign \nportfolio allocation. Following the evidence on home bias, this variable should yield a \nnegative regression coefficient.  \n \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 2 about here.............. \n \n \nWe include the logarithmic value of the GDP per capita income and GDP growth figure for \neach country to control for the level of economic development and economic growth. Both \nthese variables are obtained from the World Development Indicator. We also control for any \ncapital control measure that a country might have imposed on inward foreign portfolio \ninvestment. As a proxy for the degree of financial liberalisation we use the capital control \nintensity measure (Equity market openness) suggested by Edison and Warnok (2003). The \nlatter measure is constructed by taking the ratio of market capitalisation represented by \nS&P\/IFC investable indices (correcting for foreign ownership) to the market capitalisation \ndenominated by S&P\/IFC global indices. This variable ranges from zero to one, with one \nimplying total domestic market capitalisation freely open to foreign investors, and zero \nimplying a completely closed market. Since these indices are mostly available for developing \ncountries in the S&P\u2019s Global Stock Market Factbook, they have been set to one for all \ndeveloped countries. For more details see Edison and Warnok (2003) and various issues of \nS&P Global Stock Market Factbook. The Equity market openness variable is a time varying \nproxy and therefore captures the time variation in the financial liberalisation process (see De \nJong et al., 2005). The regression coefficient on this variable is expected to carry a positive \nsign. Our equity market openness measure is based on the assumption that all the developed \n  (4)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n13 \n \nmarkets\u2019 stocks are fully free floated, which may not be the case. Dahlquist et al. (2003) note \nthat only a small portion of the market capitalisation in most countries is available to \ninternational investors who are not controlling shareholders. They compute the percentage of \nfirms closely held for many countries. We employ the variable (Closely held firms) of \nDahlquist et al. (2003) as the percentage of closely held shares of market capitalisation to \ncomplement the Equity market openness measure. As Dahlquist et al. (2003) imply, the \nClosely held firms variable is expected to capture the prevalence of ownership restrictions, \nparticularly in countries with poor investor protection rights, and is expected to have a \nnegative regression coefficient. \n \nWe also control for the bilateral familiarity or information asymmetry variables. It is highly \nlikely that bilateral investments may be influenced by long-term bilateral relationship, \ngeographic proximity and market familiarity. We employ a language dummy (Common \nlanguage dummy), which takes the value of one if a pair of countries shares a common \nlanguage. Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and \nIndia share a common language (i.e. English). Similarly, we also include the distance (Log \ndistance) between the capital cities of the pair countries. On average, European countries are \ncloser to each other, with Australia and New Zealand being the furthest. Both variables are \nobtained from www.nber.org\/~wei\/data.html and used by Subramanian and Wei (2007). \nFurther, Chan et al. (2005) suggest that investors are more confident in holding stocks of \nforeign companies whose goods and services are well-known to them. Hence, we include the \nbilateral trade (Log bilateral trade) obtained from the Bilateral Trade Statistics database of \nthe IMF. It is constructed by adding the logarithmic value of the paired country\u2019s total export \nand import values. Countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany \nshare the highest average bilateral trade. Most of the emerging countries score lower on this \nmeasure. All the bilateral familiarity measures used in our study predict the probability of \nbilateral information flow and measure the barriers that foreign investors may encounter \nwhen seeking information overseas. It is worth noting that the three bilateral familiarity \nvariables and Equity market openness measure are orthogonalised with the free floated home \nbias measure (see Section 3.3), as a number of studies show that the latter factors explain \nhome bias to a significant extent (see Chan et al., 2005; Fidora et al., 2007).\n6\n This does not \n                                           \n6\n In fact, a simple regression of the three bilateral familiarity variables and Equity market openness measure \nexplains almost 26% of the variation in home bias, and all four independent variables are statistically \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n14 \n \naffect the competitiveness of the home bias variable, three bilateral familiarity variables and \nthe Equity market openness measure with any of our key variables of interest. \n \nWe also add a three-year moving average return (Historical return) to capture the prevalence \nof return chasing or feedback behaviour (see Bohn and Tesar, 1996; Froot et al., 2001; \nRichards, 2005; Bekaert et al., 2002; Dahlquist and Robertson, 2004; Griffin et al., 2004). \nFollowing the return chasing hypothesis, we expect the regression coefficient on this variable \nto bear a positive sign. \n \nAggarwal et al. (2005) demonstrate that U.S. funds tend to invest in open markets exhibiting \nstronger shareholder rights and legal frameworks. However, in sharp contrast, Chan et al. \n(2005) claim that investor protection does not influence the decisions of foreign investors. \nWe add a composite measure of investor protection sourced from the World Bank \nGovernance Indicator. This variable is composed of two broader aspects of regulatory \nenvironment. The first is the regulatory quality based on a scale of 1-100, capturing the \nperceptions of local government\u2019s ability to formulate and implement sound policies effective \nfor private sector development. The second, which is also measured on a scale of 0-100, is \nthe rule of law. The latter captures the perception of the extent to which agents show \nconfidence in and follow the rules of society, especially the quality of contract enforcement, \nproperty rights, the police and the courts. Both these variables are aggregated and scaled by \n0.5 to yield a rating of 0-100. A higher rating denotes greater investor protection rights and \ntherefore greater propensity of foreign investment. The regression coefficient on this variable \nshould carry a positive sign, following the claim in existing literature that investors prefer \ncountries having better investor protection measures in place. Following La Porta (1998), it is \nshown that the English common law system provides better legal protection rights to \nshareholders than the German and French civil law system. We generate a dummy (English \ncommon law dummy) which takes the value of one for common law countries and zero \notherwise. \n \nFinally, since our time series period includes the 2007-08 financial crisis, we control for the \ntime effect and the impact of the 2007-2008 financial crisis using three time dummies. The \nfirst is Pre-crisis time dummy_2002_2006 for the years 2002-2006 (2001 is the base dummy), \n                                                                                                                                   \nsignificant. Due to space constraints we do not report the results but they can be obtained from the authors on \nrequest. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n15 \n \nthe second is the Crisis-period time dummy_2007_2008 for the peak of the crisis period \n2007-2008 and the third is the Post-crisis time dummy_2009 for the year 2009, when global \nfinancial markets began to stabilise. \n \nThe summary statistics of all control variables are shown in Table 2. As expected, all the \nvariables show that emerging markets have lower economic development, although higher \neconomic growth. Developed markets score higher on the investor protection measure and, \nfollowing the financial liberalisation measures, developed markets are more open and firms\u2019 \nownerships are less closely held relative to emerging markets. \n \n3. Results of regression analysis \nDo foreign investors allocate a greater share of their wealth to relatively more developed \nequity markets? Our univariate analysis, as shown in Table 1 and discussed earlier, does \nindicate so. To further substantiate our initial findings we run a number of regressions \naddressing several robustness issues (bias and efficiency). In contrast to the preferred fixed \neffect model, the use of the random effect estimations for the majority of our regressions is \ndictated by the inclusion of time invariant factors, such as the English common law dummy, \nCommon language and Distance. Before reporting the results, it is worth noting the caveat of \nusing the panel data model. In pooling the data the estimated values of the slope coefficients \nare assumed to be identical across countries, i.e., \u03b2j=\u03b2. If this assumption holds, then this will \nlead to a more precise estimate. However, given our dataset of cross-countries, homogenous \nparameter is a very strong assumption and is apparent that the slope coefficients are not \nidentical.\n7 \nHence, in our estimations each of our pooled estimators represents an average \nslope coefficient allowing us to comment on the average predictive relationship between the \nvariables. However, we demonstrate the issue of parameter heterogeneity, across countries \nand time, in one of our regressions in section 3.6 below. \n \nWe first discuss the results of our key variables of interest and reserve examination of the \ncontrol variables until the end of this section. Given that our data is at country level and \nmatched pairs, it is fair to assume that the \u201cclustered errors\u201d i.e. the observations within \ngroups (ij), may be correlated, inducing correlation in the error term. To address the issue of \nclustering, i.e. the key source of heteroskedasticity, we use the robust variance matrix \n                                           \n7\n A similar assumption is made for parameter heterogeneity over time. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n16 \n \nestimator for correcting the standard errors for the within correlation among the units in each \nof the clusters. Wooldridge (2002) notes the resulting variance matrix, which is corrected for \nclustering, is robust to any kind of intra-cluster correlation and arbitrary heteroskedasticity, \nprovided N(cross-section units) is large relative to the number of units in each cluster. In our \ncase N is over 500 and the number of units within any cluster is a maximum of nine years of \ncountry allocation. In almost all our random effect GLS estimations, we correct the standard \nerrors using the cluster robust variance matrix (see equation 7.26 of Wooldridge (2002), page \n152 and page 330), which not only produces efficient cluster robust standard errors, but also \nthe unrestricted \u2126 matrix of the robust variance matrix estimator allows for arbitrary serial \ncorrelation. For reference and technical details on the correction, please see Wooldridge \n(2002), pages 329-330. \n \n3.1 Basic regression \nAs multi-collinearity is not a major problem (see Table 3 below) for our country-specific \nequity market characteristic ( ) measures, we include all five variables in the \nfollowing specification (5), without the controls.  \n \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 3 about here.............. \n \nThe results are presented in Table 4. Column 2 shows that except for the Exchange rate \nvolatility measure, all other  variables are highly statistically significant with correct \npredicted signs. Except for the Local equity market volatility, which is statistically significant \nonly at 10% significance level, Stock market size, Transaction costs and Market liquidity are \nsignificant even at 1% significance level. The overall R\n2\n of the above specification shows that \n accounts for 54% of cross-sectional and temporal variation in the foreign equity \nportfolio allocation. The outcomes suggest that  are the influential factors in foreign \ninvestors\u2019 country allocation decision.  \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 4 about here.............. \n \nThe statistical significance of the Stock market size variable, with an estimate of 0.51, is in \nline with previous studies validating the claim that investors prefer to invest in relatively \nbigger markets. Consistent with the suggestions of existing studies (see Chan et al., 2005), the \n  (5)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n17 \n \nresults confirm that because larger stock markets are more visible, more recognised and more \ndeveloped, they are better at attracting higher levels of foreign equity portfolio investments. \nThe predicted signs of the coefficients and the statistical significance of two micro-structural \nvariables, Transaction costs and Market liquidity, support the claim that foreign investors \nprefer to invest more of their wealth in more cost effective, more efficient and more liquid \nmarkets. The coefficient of -0.46 on transaction costs implies that investors favour markets \nwith lower transaction costs. Similarly, a higher level of market liquidity with a positive \ncoefficient of 0.33 clearly supports the conjecture that foreign investors are more inclined to \noverweight their portfolio in relatively more liquid markets, which also reflect a higher \ndegree of market efficiency. The estimate of Local equity market volatility is also significant, \nwith an expected negative sign. The coefficient of -0.11 and test statistic of -1.84 provide \nindication that investors tend to avoid more volatile markets, as higher volatility implies \nhigher risk of investment. The effect of higher volatility is more significant in smaller \nemerging markets that offer lower levels of industrial diversification for mitigating firm-\nspecific risks. The Exchange rate volatility variable, reflecting the foreign exchange risk, is \nnot statistically significant but bears the expected sign. Again, these findings are consistent \nwith our analysis of summary statistics supporting the evidence that markets which are \nrelatively bigger in size, more liquid and more cost effective are the major recipients of \nforeign equity investments.  \n \nAlthough most of our variables are statistically significant, they may be biased and the test \nstatistics inefficient in the absence of other control variables, or they may be plagued by \nendogeniety problems. To ensure the robustness of our results we undertake a number of \nadditional regressions and tackle concerns that could challenge the rigour of our findings. \n \n3.2 Omitted variable bias and cross-sectional dependence \nThe estimates of specification (5) may be biased in the absence of other factors, particularly if \nthey are correlated with . Similarly, as we have used 36 countries with a six-year \ntime dimension, there could be significant country-specific and time effects. To mitigate the \nomitted variable bias, we undertake two additional regressions. First, we run specification (6) \nincluding  and Home bias ( ) variables. We report the results in Table 4 \n(column 3). \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n18 \n \n \nAs expected, the inclusion of the home bias measure significantly increases the adequacy of \nthe model. The overall R\n2\n rises to 67% and the Home bias coefficient carries the expected \nsign and is statistically significant. This statistical significance of Home bias confirms the \nclaim that foreign investors still prefer their home markets relative to the mean-variance \nprescription. All the coefficients of  are still statistically significant, even at 1% \nsignificance level, and bear expected signs. In contrast to the previous regression, the \nExchange rate volatility measure is now statistically significant and the negative sign \nsignifies that investors tend to invest less in countries experiencing higher movement in their \nexchange rates. The size of all coefficients does change, which is understandable, as the \naddition of Home bias factor mitigates omitted variable bias to a considerable extent and \nfurther improves the efficiency of test statistics. \n \nWe further add all other observed control variables and the time dummies in specification (7) \nbelow and report the results in Table 4 (column 4).  \n \n \n \n \nAs expected, the magnitudes of the estimates do alter, but the adequacy of the model further \nimproves, as indicated by the R\n2\n of 79%. Although the size of the estimates changes, the \ncoefficients of all our key variables, except the local volatility measure, are still statistically \nsignificant at the conventional significance level of 5%, except for Local equity market \nvolatility, which is significant only at 10% significance level.  \n \nOne of the key reasons for employing a panel data framework is to allow for the unobserved \ntime invariant unit-specific effects which, if correlated with any of the regressors, may \npotentially produce biased estimates. Although we have been able to control for most of the \ntime varying and observed time invariant variables, unit-specific effects may also bias our \nestimates significantly from their true values. Examples of such effect could be special \ntreaties between pair countries, favoured country, cultural ties and common colonial history. \nWe address the issue of unobserved individual heterogeneity by running specification (8), \n  (6)  \n  (7)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n19 \n \nwhich is similar to specification (7), but here we use fixed effect estimation instead of \nrandom effect estimation.  \n \n \nFurthermore, we also correct the standard errors of fixed effect estimation for \nheteroskedasticity that may arise from cross-sectional dependency using the Driscoll and \nKraay (1998) standard errors for coefficients estimated. These standard errors are robust to \ngeneral forms of cross-sectional and temporal dependence. Because this nonparametric \ntechnique of estimating standard errors places no restrictions on the limiting behaviour of the \nnumber of panels, the size of the cross-sectional dimension does not constitute a constraint on \nfeasibility even if the number of panels is much larger than T. For further technical details of \nthe correction, please see Driscoll and Kraay (1998). However, it is worth noting that we can \nonly apply the fixed effect model at the cost of excluding any time invariant variables. \nFurthermore, although the coeffiicents of fixed effect estimations are relatively more \nunbiased, they may not be the most efficient compared to random effect estimation because \nthe former only uses the within variations in the dataset (see Wooldridge, 2002 for technical \ndetails). \n \n \nAs shown in Table 4 (column 5), all our  measures, except the local equity market \nvolatility factor, are still statistically significant. This further substantiates that even after \nincluding all the observed and unobserved covariates, and controlling for cross-sectional \ndependency, the three measures of , i.e. size, trading cost and liquidity, have a \nstrong influence on investors\u2019 country allocation decision. \n \n3.3 Home bias and free investability \nIt is evident from the literature (see French and Poterba, 1991; Tesar and Werner, 1995; \nWarnock, 2001; Karlsson and Norden, 2007; Chan et al., 2005; Fidora et al., 2007) that \ninvestors tend to significantly overweight their home market and therefore actual portfolios \ndeviate from the theoretically derived world market portfolio. Chan et al. (2005) note that if \nforeign investors overweight their local market, then the rest of their allocation should also be \ndisproportionately lower. Consequently, Home bias could be an important explanatory \nvariable for explaining foreign allocation.  \n  (8)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n20 \n \nHowever, home bias may itself be created by investment restrictions imposed by host \ncountries, whereby the entire market capitalisation for a given country may not be freely \navailable for investment to foreign investors. This may be particularly true for emerging \nmarkets. In order to address this issue we include two variables in our previous regressions \nthat potentially control for this deficiency. The first is Equity market openness and the second \nClosely held firms. We further deal with the automatic impact of home bias and potential \ninvestability problem by constructing a freely floated home bias measure using the \nS&P\/IFC\u2019s freely investable market capitalisation variable instead of the S&P\/IFC\u2019s global \nmarket capitalisation used to construct our benchmark index.  \n \nAs investors deviate from holding the world market portfolio, following Fidora et al. (2007) \nwe construct the following bilateral home bias ( ) to control for the impact of home \nbias on foreign equity allocation: \n \n \nwhere  is bilateral home bias observed by investor country i for country j at time t, \nand Mjt is as defined earlier but constructed using the S&P\/IFC\u2019s freely investable market \ncapitalisation instead of the S&P\/IFC\u2019s global market capitalisation. However, a caveat is \nworth noting here. The S&P\/IFC\u2019s freely investable market capitalisation is only available \nfor emerging markets; therefore, for the developed markets we assume that the entire market \nvalue is freely available to foreign investors, which may not be true. Nonetheless, we believe \nthe addition of the Closely held firms variable captures the deficiency, if any. We run the \nfollowing specification (10) using the freely floated (FA_Hbias) home bias variable, \nexcluding the benchmark index. We present the output in Table 4 (column 6). \n \n \n \nAs expected, the  is highly statistically significant. All our variables of interest, i.e. \n, are highly statistically significant with expected signs. \n \n \n \n  (9)  \n  (10)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n21 \n \n3.4 Indirect exposures \nWe next resolve the effect of investors having indirect exposure to foreign equities in major \nfinancial centres. Our dataset on international equity portfolio investments includes direct \npurchase in the domestic markets and investment in global shares and depository receipts. \nSolnik and McLeavey (2004) note that big and internationally active companies issue\/list \ntheir stocks on multiple and major stock exchanges, such as London, New York or Tokyo, for \ngreater investor base, broader visibility, higher liquidity, and to avoid stringent and costly \nhome regulatory stipulation. If this is the case, market-specific development and stability \nfeatures may not matter to foreign investors, as they can have exposure to foreign stocks in \ntheir own major financial centres. To overcome the potential problem of major financial \ncentres, we run the following specification (11) but exclude the U.S., the U.K. and Japan as \ninvestor countries. \n \n \nAs shown in Table 4 (column 7), even after removing the investors from the major financial \ncentres, the coefficients of  factors, except for the local market volatility variable, \ni.e. size, trading cost and liquidity, are still statistically significant, supporting the view that \ncountry-specific capital market features play a prominent role in foreign equity portfolio \nallocation decisions. \n \n3.5  Endogeneity  \nEndogeneity may be a potential problem for our results. Errunza (2001) notes that the growth \nin foreign equity portfolio investment may itself trigger reform measures towards greater \ndevelopment of local capital markets. In the sample used, it is likely that our estimates may \nsuffer from the endogeneity problem arising from reverse causality. To resolve the reverse \ncausality problem we first generate a fitted variable using specification (5) but only including \nthe most consistently most robust variables, i.e. Stock market size, Transaction costs and \nMarket liquidity, and we refer to it as Development proxy.\n8\n Following Gelos and Wei (2005), \n                                           \n8\n Alternatively, we also use a common factor generated using principal component analysis, but the statistical \nresults are similar as the common factor has a correlation of 0.92 with the Development proxy. \n  (11)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n22 \n \nwe use one-year lag value of the Development proxy and run the following specification \n(12).\n9\n \n \n \n \nAs reported in Table 5 below, Development proxy, which is the fitted value of Stock market \nsize, Transaction costs and Market Liquidity, is highly statistically significant.\n10\n This \nconfirms that our results do not suffer from reverse causality. \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 5 about here.............. \n \n3.6 Cross-country heterogeneity and impact of the 2007-08 financial crisis \nAs noted earlier, the estimated coefficients show an average predictive relationship between \nthe variables. However, given our dataset is at country level, it is highly probable that the size \nof the estimates may vary across countries. To demonstrate this point, we select the Indian \nand the United States country dummies (arbitrary selection) and interact them with our \nDevelopment proxy. We call these interactive variables Development_India and \nDevelopment_USA respectively.  \n \nSimilarly, since our dataset includes the 2007-08 financial crisis period, the question to be \nasked is: do the statistical and economic relationships between development proxy and \nforeign equity portfolio allocation hold during the 2007-08 financial crisis? Here we make an \nattempt to answer this question by including time interactive variables. We interact the three \ntime dummies, i.e. Pre-crisis time dummy_2002_2006, Crisis period time dummy_2007_2008 \nand Post-crisis dummy_2009, with our Development proxy and refer to them as \nDevelopment_2002_2006, Development_2007_2008 and Development_2009 variables. We \nrun the following specification (13).  \n \n                                           \n9\n We also use one-year lag values of the individual CSEMCs, and find all of the measures, except local equity \nmarket volatility, to be statistically significant at 5% significance level. We do not report the results but these \ncan be obtained from the authors on request. \n10\n The development proxy and most of the variables are also statistically significant at the conventional 5% \nsignificance level when we run the first difference estimation. \n (12)  \n (13)  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n23 \n \nWe report the results in Table 6 below. As seen, all the interactive variables are statistically \nsignificant. The sizes of the estimates for Development_India, 1.408\n11\n (1.491-0.0830) and for \nDevelopment_USA, 1.033\n12\n (1.491-0.458) are different. Clearly, our analysis shows that if \nmarket development factors improve equally for India and the United States, foreign \ninvestors are, on a relative basis, willing to allocate proportionally more in the Indian equity \nmarket. This should not be surprising because, as shown in Table 2 (column 2), the home bias \nfor India is greater (2.07) than the United States (1.33). Hence, following the prescription of \nthe ICAPM, any identical improvement in the stock market development factor should reduce \nthe Indian home bias correspondingly more than the home bias observed for the United \nStates.  \n \nClearly, the above differential analysis demonstrates that each country may have an \nasymmetric effect on foreign equity portfolio allocations to changes in their stock market \ndevelopment factors, depending on the level of home bias observed by foreign investors and \npossibly on other market characteristics which may influence home bias, particularly bilateral \nfamiliarity factors. \n \nIn terms of the impact of the 2007-08 financial crisis on the relationship between \nDevelopment proxy and country allocation, all the time interactive variables are statistically \nsignificant. However, in terms of their economic impact on the average relationship, they are \ndifferent. The relatively smaller differential coefficient of -0.111 for the \nDevelopment_2002_2006 factor, with the average size of 1.38\n13\n (1.491-0.111), demonstrates \nthat during the pre-crisis period (2001-2006), the size of the average parameter was relatively \nstable. However, during the crisis period of 2007-2008, the average size reduced from 1.491 \nto 0.734\n14\n (1.491-0.757). Clearly, the deep and far-reaching global financial crisis of 2007-\n2008 had a systematic effect in almost every country around the world, particularly those that \nare financially integrated with the global economy. This suggests that the differential \ncoefficient of -0.757 for the Development_2007_2008 factor, though material, is not \nunexpected. However, even during the crisis period, we see the relationship between market \ndevelopment and country allocation still holds, as indicated by the statistically significant \ncoefficient of 0.734 (1.491-0.757) with the linear combination test statistic of 15.13. \n                                           \n11\n The linear combination test statistic is 32.18. \n12\n The linear combination test statistic is 21.04. \n13\n The linear combination test statistic is 31.10. \n14\n The linear combination test statistic is 15.13. \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n24 \n \nThe size of the Development_2009 variable, i.e. -0.567, which is smaller than the crisis \nperiod factor size of -0.757, indicates that when the global financial markets began to \nstabilise, the predictive relationship between market development and country allocation \nseems to be gradually reverting to its average. \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 6 about here.............. \n \n3.7 Relative importance of each CSEMC measure \nWhat is the relative importance of each of the  factors? We demonstrate the \nincremental contribution of each of the factors in explaining variation in foreign equity \nportfolio allocation using the R\n2\n metric. We run five different specifications, beginning with \nStock market size only in the first regression, and increasing the variable numbers by adding \neach of the  factors subsequently. It is worth noting that the R\n2\n metric may not \nproduce reliable results if the sample size varies substantially across the regressions. As \nshown in Table 6 below, the only difference in sample size observed is between the first \nregression and the remaining four regressions. However, the difference is less than 10% and \ntherefore should not materially affect our result. \n \nThe outputs across all the year-wise regressions clearly show that two most important \nvariables is the size of the stock market and transaction costs. The statistical significance of \nthe Stock market size with an R\n2\n of 20% again indicates that investors are more inclined to \ninvest in more visible, more industrially diversified and more developed capital markets. \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 7 about here.............. \n \nThe second but almost equally important variable is Transaction costs, with an additional \nGoodness of fit contribution of 21%. The significance of transaction costs again confirms the \nclaim that foreign investors may shy away from markets with significantly higher trading \ncosts. Market liquidity adds a further 13%, but the volatility measures do not show signs of \nany further addition. The statistical significance of market development variables, except for \nthe volatility measures, clearly suggests that foreign investors favour investing in bigger, \nhighly visible and more liquid stock markets. \n \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n25 \n \n3.8 Foreign equity portfolio holdings, allocations and 2007-08 financial crisis \nIn almost all of the regressions discussed above, we observe that the Crisis period time \ndummy_2007_2008 is not only statistically significant but bears the expected sign and is \nmuch bigger than the Pre-crisis time dummy_2002_2006 and the Post crisis period time \ndummy_2009. Given the severity of the global financial crisis, this is expected. To evaluate \nthe impact of the crisis on foreign equity portfolio holdings and the allocation of individual \nhost countries in our sample, we produce the average holdings figures in Table 8 and the \naverage allocation figures in Table 9 below. \n \nAs shown, the total of the average holdings for all our sample countries for the year 2006 \nwere USD 540 billion and for 2007 were USD 626 billion. However, during the 2008 peak \nfinancial crisis year, this figure dropped to USD 346 billion.  \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 8 about here.............. \n \n\u2026\u2026\u2026......Insert Table 9 about here.............. \n \nIf we observe the changes in the value of holdings (column 6 and 7) over time, it is evident \nthat although the crisis began in the summer of 2007, the real impact was felt in the year \n2008, particularly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. In fact, for almost all the host \ncountries, 2007 (column 3) saw elevation in the foreign equity portfolio holdings compared to \nthe average of 2006. However, in the year 2008 (column 4), and as reported in column 6, all \nthe host countries lost significant value of their shares relative to the year 2007. Given the \nnature of widespread, globally systematic and the deep impact of the 2007-08 financial crisis \non world equity markets, it is not surprising that most of the developed host countries lost \nrelatively more of their foreign equity holdings compared to the emerging host countries. \nHowever, as the markets began to stabilise in 2009, it was again the developed markets which \nrecouped relatively much greater shares of their losses, as seen by the increase in their \nholdings for the year 2009 (column 5) and their differences over the year 2008 (column 7). \n \nIf we conduct similar analyses for the changes in allocation over the four-year period, as \nreported in Table 9, although for most of the host countries the allocation decreases in the \nyear 2008, with the exception of the United States, on average the cross-section of average \nallocation is relatively stable over the four-year period. This signifies that although the \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n26 \n \nvaluation of the holdings has changed over time, the global country allocations of the foreign \ninvestors seem to be fairly steady in our sample. \n \n3.9 Control variables \nNot all the controls have the expected sign and statistical significance and are able to stand \nthe robustness tests across the wide range of specifications. If we follow the efficient random \neffect model, the most important and generally consistent across the extensive spectrum of \nestimations are the familiarity variables. The significance of bilateral trade measure in all \nspecifications is an indication that investors regard the problem of information asymmetry as \na potential barrier when investing in foreign securities (see Portes and Rey, 2005; Chan et al., \n2005; Fidora et al., 2007). Similarly, investors tend to invest more of their wealth in countries \nnearer to them than farther from them, as reflected by the significance of the distance \nvariable. The significance of common language across all specifications also shows that \ninvestors are more prepared to invest in countries sharing a common language, as this \nmitigates the information asymmetry problem to some extent (see Chan et al., 2005; Fidora et \nal., 2007). \n \nThe issue of investor protection is debatable in the literature, with mixed conclusions reported \nby a number of existing studies (Aggarwal et al., 2005 and Chan et al., 2005). Aggarwal et al. \n(2005), using U.S. data, find that U.S. investors are inclined to allocate more funds to \ncountries with better investor protection rights in place. However, Chan et al. (2005), using \ndata on 26 countries (emerging and developed), show that investors are influenced more by \nstock market development and bilateral familiarity issues, and investor protection does not \nplay any significant role in their investment decisions. In fact, their study finds that the \ninvestor protection measures carry an unexpected sign, similar to what our results reveal for \nthe World Bank\u2019s Investor protection measure, particularly for the cross-section estimations. \nBekaert et al. (2007) conjecture that foreign investors may be more concerned about those \naspects of regulatory environment that directly affect foreign investments, such as \nrepatriation risk, exchange control risk, etc. It could be that the legal dummy captures \ninvestor protection effects specifically related to foreign investment, as most of the countries \nfollowing English common law have relatively higher levels of investor protection rights for \nforeign investors. However, the issue needs further investigation. The capital control \nmeasures (Equity market openness and Closely held firms) are generally consistent and carry \nthe expected sign, indicating that despite motivation to invest, investors may face legal \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n27 \n \nrestrictions imposed by host countries. Though the economic development measure (GDP per \ncapita) also seems to be generally consistent, we do not find the economic growth (GDP \ngrowth) and Historical returns measures to be significant and consistent in terms of predicted \nsigns across different specifications. Similar results are also reported by other studies (see \nGelos and Wei, 2005; Chan et al., 2005). \n \n 4. Conclusion \nForeign equity portfolio investment is a vital channel through which countries attract \noverseas investment. Foreign equity portfolio investors play a pivotal role in the development \nof local (host) equity markets, which in turn drives the domestic economic development. \nGiven the importance of foreign equity portfolio investment, it is imperative for policymakers \nto appreciate factors influencing the country allocation decision of foreign investors. \nFollowing the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM), a host country should \nreceive their share of foreign equity portfolio investments, i.e. the proportion of their local \nmarket capitalisation in the world market portfolio. However, despite the conjectural \nprescription, foreign investors do not exploit investment opportunities offered by world \nmarket capitalisation. Relative to the suggestion of ICAPM, why do foreign investors not \nhold the world market portfolio, and what role do country-specific equity market \ncharacteristics play in the country allocations of foreign investors? \n \nThis study presents a comprehensive and thorough assessment of the impact of country-\nspecific equity market characteristics on the allocation decisions of foreign equity portfolio \ninvestors. Although each individual host country may demonstrate an asymmetric effect, on \naverage we show that stock market development factors, particularly, size, trading cost and \nmarket liquidity (market efficiency), play important roles in explaining a significant \nproportion of the cross-sectional and time variation in foreign equity portfolio allocations. \nOur results confirm that foreign equity portfolio investors prefer to invest more of their \nwealth in larger, more liquid and more efficient markets with lower trading costs. This \nassertion also holds when taking account of the recent 2007-08 financial crisis. The robust \nfindings of our study imply that by improving the preconditions necessary for well-\nfunctioning capital markets, policymakers should be able to attract higher levels of foreign \nequity portfolio investments.  \n  \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n28 \n \nReferences \n \nAggarwal, R., Klapper, L., Wysocki, P.

The sample size \nand inclusion of controls varies across different specifications. Except fixed effect (column 5), all estimations are based on random effect model. The first \nspecification does not include any control (column 2). The second includes home bias as the only control (column 3), while the third includes home bias and all \nother controls, including time dummies (column 4). The fourth specification includes all time variant controls, including time dummies, but uses fixed effect \nestimation (column 5). The fifth specification also includes all controls and time dummies but uses the free float home bias (column 6). Finally, the sixth \nspecification includes all controls and time dummies but excludes the major financial centres\u2019 countries (U.S. U.K. and Japan) from the sample (column 7). In all \nthe random effect estimations, the test statistics are made robust allowing for clusters in each cross-sectional unit. Furthermore, the fixed effect model uses \nDriscoll and Kraay\u2019s (1998) standard errors for correcting cross-sectional dependence.
