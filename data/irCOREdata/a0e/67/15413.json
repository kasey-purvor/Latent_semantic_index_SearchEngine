The Induced Minor Containment problem takes as input\ntwo graphs G and H, and asks whether G has H as an induced minor. We\nshow that this problem is fixed parameter tractable in |VH | if G belongs\nto any minor-closed graph class andH is a planar graph. For a fixed graph\nH, the H-Contractibility problem is to decide whether a graph can\nbe contracted to H. The computational complexity classification of this\nproblem is still open. So far,H has a dominating vertex in all cases known\nto be polynomially solvable, whereas H does not have such a vertex in\nall cases known to be NP-complete. Here, we present a class of graphs H\nwith a dominating vertex for whichH-Contractibility is NP-complete.\nWe also present a new class of graphs H for which H-Contractibility\nis polynomially solvable. Finally, we study the (H, v)-Contractibility\nproblem, where v is a vertex of H. The input of this problem is a graph\nG and an integer k, and the question is whether G is H-contractible such\nthat the \u201cbag\u201d of G corresponding to v contains at least k vertices. We\nshow that this problem is NP-complete whenever H is connected and v\nis not a dominating vertex of H.\n1 Introduction\nThere are several natural and elementary algorithmic problems that check if the\nstructure of some fixed graph H shows up as a pattern within the structure of\nsome input graph G. This paper studies the computational complexity of two\n\u2217An extended abstract of this paper has been presented at SOFSEM 2010.\n\u2020Supported by EPSRC (EP\/D053633\/1).\n\u2021Supported by the project \u201cKapodistrias\u201d (A\u03a0 02839\/28.07.2008) of the National\nand Kapodistrian University of Athens (project code: 70\/4\/8757).\nsuch problems, namely the problems of deciding if a graph G can be transformed\ninto a graph H by performing a sequence of edge contractions and vertex dele-\ntions, or by performing a sequence of edge contractions only. Theoretical moti-\nvation for this research can be found in [3, 8, 14, 15] and comes from hamiltonian\ngraph theory [12] and graph minor theory [16], as we will explain below. Practical\napplications include surface simplification in computer graphics [1, 4] and cluster\nanalysis of large data sets [5, 11, 13]. In the first practical application, graphic\nobjects are represented using (triangulated) graphs and these graphs need to be\nsimplified. One of the techniques to do this is by using edge contractions. In the\nsecond application, graphs are coarsened by means of edge contractions.\nBasic Terminology. All graphs in this paper are undirected, finite, and have\nneither loops nor multiple edges. Let G and H be two graphs. The edge contrac-\ntion of edge e = uv in G removes u and v from G, and replaces them by a new\nvertex adjacent to precisely those vertices to which u or v were adjacent. If H\ncan be obtained from G by a sequence of edge contractions, vertex deletions and\nedge deletions, then G contains H as a minor. If H can be obtained from G by\na sequence of edge contractions and vertex deletions, then G contains H as an\ninduced minor. If H can be obtained from G by a sequence of edge contractions,\nthen G is said to be contractible to H and G is called H-contractible. This is\nequivalent to saying that G has a so-called H-witness structure W, which is a\npartition of VG into |VH | sets W (h), called H-witness sets, such that each W (h)\ninduces a connected subgraph of G and for every two hi, hj \u2208 VH , witness sets\nW (hi) and W (hj) are adjacent in G if and only if hi and hj are adjacent in H.\nHere, two subsets A,B of VG are called adjacent if there is an edge ab \u2208 EG with\na \u2208 A and b \u2208 B. Clearly, by contracting the vertices in the witness sets W (h)\nto a single vertex for every h \u2208 VH , we obtain the graph H. See Figure 1 for\nan example that shows that in general the witness sets W (h) are not uniquely\ndefined.\nFig. 1. Two P4-witness structures of a graph.\nThe problems H-Minor Containment, H-Induced Minor Contain-\nment and H-Contractibility ask if an input graph G has H as a minor,\nhas H as an induced minor or is H-contractible, respectively. When H is part\nof the input, we denote the three problems by Minor Containment, Induced\nMinor Containment and Contractibility.\n2\nKnown Results. A celebrated result by Robertson and Seymour [16] states\nthat H-Minor Containment can be solved in polynomial time for every fixed\ngraph H. The complexity classification of the other two problems is still open.\nFellows, Kratochv\u00b4\u0131l, Middendorf, and Pfeiffer [8] give both polynomially solvable\nand NP-complete cases for the the H-Induced Minor Containment problem.\nThey also prove the following.\nTheorem 1 ([8]). For every fixed H, the H-Induced Minor Containment\nproblem is polynomially solvable for planar input graphs.\nBrouwer and Veldman [3] initiated the research on the H-Contractibility\nproblem. Their main result is stated below. A dominating vertex is a vertex\nadjacent to all other vertices.\nTheorem 2 ([3]). Let H be a connected triangle-free graph. The H-Contract-\nibility problem is in P if H has a dominating vertex, and is NP-complete oth-\nerwise.\nNote that a connected triangle-free graph with a dominating vertex is a star\nand that H = P4 (path on four vertices) and H = C4 (cycle on four vertices)\nare the smallest graphs H for which H-Contractibility is NP-complete. The\nresearch of [3] was continued in [14, 15].\nTheorem 3 ([14, 15]). Let H be a connected graph with |VH | \u2264 5. The H-\nContractibility problem is in P if H has a dominating vertex, and is NP-\ncomplete otherwise.\nThe NP-completeness results in Theorem 2 and 3 can be extended using the\nnotion of degree-two covers. Let dG(x) denote the degree of a vertex x in a graph\nG. A graph H \u2032 with an induced subgraph H is called a degree-two cover of H\nif the following two conditions both hold. First, for all x \u2208 VH , if dH(x) = 1\nthen dH\u2032(x) \u2265 2, and if dH(x) = 2 and its two neighbors in H are adjacent then\ndH\u2032(x) \u2265 3. Second, for all x\u2032 \u2208 VH\u2032 \\ VH , either x\u2032 has one neighbor and this\nneighbor is in H, or x\u2032 has two neighbors and these two neighbors form an edge\nin H.\nTheorem 4 ([14]). Let H \u2032 be a degree-two cover of a connected graph H. If\nH-Contractibility is NP-complete, then so is H \u2032-Contractibility.\nIn [3, 14] a number of other results are shown. To discuss these we need some\nextra terminology (which we will use later in the paper as well). For two graphs\nG1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) with V1 \u2229 V2 = \u2205, we denote their join by\nG1 on G2 = (V1 \u222a V2, E1 \u222a E2 \u222a {uv | u \u2208 V1, v \u2208 V2}), and their disjoint union\nby G1 \u222a G2 = (V1 \u222a V2, E1 \u222a E2). For the disjoint union G \u222a G \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a G of k\ncopies of the graph G, we write kG; for k = 0 this yields the empty graph (\u2205, \u2205).\nFor integers a1, a2, . . . , ak \u2265 0, we let H\u2217i (a1, a2, . . . , ak) be the graph Ki on\n(a1P1\u222aa2P2\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aakPk), where Ki is the complete graph on i vertices and Pi is\nthe path on i vertices. Note that H\u22171 (a1) denotes a star on a1+1 vertices. Brouwer\n3\nand Veldman [3] show that H-Contractibility is polynomially solvable for\nH = H\u22171 (a1) or H = H\n\u2217\n1 (a1, a2) for any a1, a2 \u2265 0. Observe that H\u2217i (0) = Ki\nand that Ki-Contractibility is equivalent to Ki-Minor Containment, and\nhence polynomially solvable, by the previously mentioned result of Robertson\nand Seymour [16]. These results have been generalized in [14] leading to the\nfollowing theorem.\nTheorem 5 ([14]). The H-Contractibility problem is in P for:\n1. H = H\u22171 (a1, a2, . . . , ak) for any k \u2265 1 and a1, a2, . . . , ak \u2265 0\n2. H = H\u22172 (a1, a2) for any a1, a2 \u2265 0\n3. H = H\u22173 (a1) for any a1 \u2265 0\n4. H = H\u2217i (0), for any i \u2265 1.\nOur Results and Paper Organization. In Section 2 we first recall some ba-\nsic notions in parameterized complexity. Then we consider the Induced Minor\nContainment problem, where we assume that G belongs to some fixed minor-\nclosed graph class G (i.e., contains every minor of every member) and that H is\nplanar. We prove that under these assumptions this problem becomes fixed pa-\nrameter tractable in |VH |. Note that the graph H in Theorem 1 may be assumed\nto be planar, as otherwise any (planar) input graph is a no-instance. This ob-\nservation, together with the fact that the class of planar graphs is minor-closed,\nimplies that our aforementioned result generalizes Theorem 1.\nThe presence of a dominating vertex seems to play an interesting role in the\ncomplexity classification of the H-Contractibility problem. So far, in all poly-\nnomially solvable cases of this problem the pattern graph H has a dominating\nvertex, and in all NP-complete cases H does not have such a vertex. Follow-\ning this trend, we extend Theorem 5 in Section 3.1 by showing that H\u22174 (a1)-\nContractibility is polynomially solvable for all a1 \u2265 0. In Section 3.2 how-\never we present the first class of graphs H with a dominating vertex for which\nH-Contractibility is NP-complete.\nIn Section 4 we study the following problem.\n(H, v)-Contractibility\nInstance: A graph G and a positive integer k.\nQuestion: Does G have an H-witness structure W with |W (v)| \u2265 k?\nWe show that (H, v)-Contractibility is NP-complete whenever H is con-\nnected and v is not a dominating vertex of H. For example, let P3 = p1p2p3.\nThen the (P3, p3)-Contractibility problem is NP-complete (whereas P3-Con-\ntractibility is polynomially solvable). Section 5 contains the conclusions and\nmentions a number of open problems.\n2 Induced Minors in Minor-Closed Classes\nWe start this section with a short introduction on the complexity classes XP\nand FPT. Both classes are defined in the framework of parameterized complex-\nity as developed by Downey and Fellows [7]. The complexity class XP consists\n4\nof parameterized decision problems \u03a0 such that for each instance (I, k) it can\nbe decided in O(f(k)|I|g(k)) time whether (I, k) \u2208 \u03a0, where f and g are com-\nputable functions depending only on k. So XP consists of parameterized decision\nproblems which can be solved in polynomial time if the parameter is considered\nto be a constant. A problem is fixed parameter tractable in k if an instance (I, k)\ncan be solved in time O(f(k)nc), where f denotes a computable function and c a\nconstant independent of k. Therefore, such an algorithm may provide a solution\nto the problem efficiently if the parameter is reasonably small. The complexity\nclass FPT \u2286 XP is the class of all fixed-parameter tractable decision problems.\nWe show that Induced Minor Containment is fixed parameter tractable\nin |VH | on input pairs (G,H) with G from any fixed minor-closed graph class\nG and H planar. Before doing this we first recall the following notions. A tree\ndecomposition of a graph G = (V,E) is a pair (X , T ), where X = {X1, . . . , Xr} is\na collection of bags, which are subsets of V , and T is a tree on vertex set X with\nthe following three properties. First,\n\u22c3r\ni=1Xi = V . Second, for each uv \u2208 E,\nthere exists a bag Xi such that {u, v} \u2286 Xi. Third, if v \u2208 Xi and v \u2208 Xj then\nall bags in T on the (unique) path between Xi and Xj contain v. The width of\na tree decomposition (X , T ) is max{|Xi| \u2212 1 | i = 1, . . . , r}, and the treewidth\ntw(G) of G is the minimum width over all possible tree decompositions of G.\nOur proof idea is as follows. We check if the input graph G has sufficiently\nlarge treewidth. If not, then we apply the monadic second-order logic result of\nCourcelle [6]. Otherwise, we show that G always contains H as an induced minor.\nBefore going into details, we first introduce some additional terminology.\nThe k\u00d7k grid Mk has as vertex set all pairs (i, j) for i, j = 0, 1, . . . , k\u22121, and\ntwo vertices (i, j) and (i\u2032, j\u2032) are joined by an edge if and only if |i\u2212i\u2032|+|j\u2212j\u2032| = 1.\nFor k \u2265 2, let \u0393k denote the graph obtained from Mk by triangulating its faces as\nfollows: add an edge between vertices (i, j) and (i\u2032, j\u2032) if i\u2212 i\u2032 = 1 and j\u2032\u2212 j = 1,\nand add an edge between corner vertex (k\u2212 1, k\u2212 1) and every external vertex,\ni.e., every vertex (i, j) with i \u2208 {0, k \u2212 1} or j \u2208 {0, k \u2212 1}. We let \u03a0k denote\nthe graph obtained from \u0393k by adding a new vertex s that is adjacent to every\nvertex of \u0393k. See Figure 2 for the graphs M6, \u03936, and \u03a06.\ns\nFig. 2. The graphs M6, \u03936, and \u03a06, respectively.\n5\nLet F denote a set of graphs. Then a graph G is called F-minor-free if G does\nnot contain a graph in F as a minor. If F = {F} we say that G is F -minor-free.\nWe need the following results from [9] and [8], respectively.\nTheorem 6 ([9]). For every graph F , there is a constant cF such that every\nconnected F -minor-free graph of treewidth at least cF \u00b7 k2 is \u0393k-contractible or\n\u03a0k-contractible.\nTheorem 7 ([8]). For every planar graph H, there is a constant bH such that\nevery planar graph of treewidth at least bH contains H as an induced minor.\nWe also recall the well-known result of Robertson and Seymour [17] proving\nWagner\u2019s conjecture.\nTheorem 8 ([17]). A graph class G is minor-closed if and only if there exists\na finite set F of graphs such that G is equal to the class of F-minor-free graphs.\nWe are now ready to prove our generalization of Theorem 1 (recall that the\ngraph H in this theorem may be assumed to be planar and that the class of\nplanar graphs is minor-closed).\nTheorem 9. Let G be any minor-closed graph class. Then the Induced Minor\nContainment problem is fixed parameter tractable in |VH | on input pairs (G,H)\nwith G \u2208 G and H planar.\nProof. Let H be a fixed planar graph with constant bH as defined in Theorem 7.\nLet G be a graph on n vertices in a minor-closed graph class G. From Theorem 8\nwe deduce that there exists a finite set F of graphs such that G is F-minor-\nfree. By Theorem 6, for each F \u2208 F , there exists a constant cF such that every\nconnected F -minor-free graph of treewidth at least cF \u00b7 b2H is \u0393bH -contractible or\n\u03a0bH -contractible. Let c := max{cF | F \u2208 F}. We first check if tw(G) < c \u00b7 b2H .\nWe can do so as recognizing such graphs is fixed parameter tractable in c \u00b7 b2H\ndue to a result of Bodlaender [2].\nCase 1. tw(G) < c \u00b7 b2H . The property of having H as an induced minor is\nexpressible in monadic second-order logic (cf. [8]). Hence, by a well-known result\nof Courcelle [6], we can determine in O(n) time if G contains H as an induced\nminor.\nCase 2. tw(G) \u2265 c \u00b7 b2H . We will show that in this case G is a yes-instance. By\nTheorem 6, we find that G is \u0393bH -contractible or \u03a0bH -contractible.\nFirst suppose G is \u0393bH -contractible. Then G has \u0393bH as an induced minor.\nIt is easy to prove that MbH has treewidth bH . It is clear from the definition of\ntreewidth that any supergraph of MbH , and \u0393bH in particular, has treewidth at\nleast bH . Note that \u0393bH is a planar graph. Then, by Theorem 7, \u0393bH has H as\nan induced minor. Consequently, by transitivity, G has H as an induced minor.\nNow suppose G is \u03a0bH -contractible. Let W be a \u03a0bH -witness structure of\nG. We remove all vertices in W (s) from G. We then find that G has \u0393bH as an\ninduced minor and return to the previous situation. uunionsq\n6\n3 The H-Contractibility Problem\nAs we mentioned in Section 1, the presence of a dominating vertex seems to play\nan interesting role in the complexity classification of the H-Contractibility\nproblem. So far, in all polynomially solvable cases of this problem the pattern\ngraph H has a dominating vertex, and in all NP-complete cases H does not\nhave such a vertex. The first result of this section follows this pattern: we prove\nin Section 3.1 that H\u22174 (a1)-Contractibility is polynomially solvable for all\na1 \u2265 0. In Section 3.2 however we present the first class of graphs H with a\ndominating vertex for which H-Contractibility is NP-complete.\n3.1 Polynomial Cases With Four Dominating Vertices\nIn this section, we extend Theorem 5 by showing that H-Contractibility is\npolynomially solvable for H = H\u22174 (a1) for any integer a1 \u2265 0.\nLet H and G be graphs such that G is H-contractible. LetW be an H-witness\nstructure of G. We call the subset of vertices in a witness set W (hi) that are\nadjacent to vertices in some other witness set W (hj) a connector CW(hi, hj).\nWe use the notion of connectors to simplify the witness structure of an H\u22174 (a1)-\ncontractible graph. Let G[U ] denote the subgraph of G induced by U \u2286 VG.\nLet y1, . . . , y4 denote the four dominating vertices of H\u22174 (a1) and let x1, . . . , xa1\ndenote the remaining vertices of H\u22174 (a1).\nLemma 1. Let a1 \u2265 0. Every H\u22174 (a1)-contractible graph has an H\u22174 (a1)-witness\nstructure W \u2032 such that 1 \u2264 |CW\u2032(xi, yj)| \u2264 2 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 a1 and for all\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 4.\nProof. LetW be an H\u22174 (a1)-witness structure of an H\u22174 (a1)-contractible graph G.\nBelow we transform W into a witness structure W \u2032 that satisfies the statement\nof the lemma.\nFrom each W (xi) we move as many vertices as possible to W (y1)\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aW (y4)\nin a greedy way and without destroying the witness structure. This way we obtain\nan H\u22174 (a1)-witness structure W \u2032 of G. We claim that 1 \u2264 |CW\u2032(xi, yj)| \u2264 2 for\nall 1 \u2264 i \u2264 a1 and for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 4.\nSuppose, for contradiction, that |CW\u2032(xi, yj)| \u2265 3 for some xi and yj . Let\nu1, u2, u3 be three vertices in CW\u2032(xi, yj). Then G[W \u2032(xi) \\ {u1}] has at least\none component that contains a vertex of CW\u2032(xi, y1) \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a CW\u2032(xi, y4). Let\nL1, . . . , Lp denote the vertex sets of these components. Observe that each Lq\nmust be adjacent to at least two witness sets from {W \u2032(y1), . . . ,W \u2032(y4)} that\nare not adjacent to W \u2032(xi) \\ Lq, since otherwise we would have moved Lq to\nW \u2032(y1)\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aW \u2032(y4). Since u1 is adjacent to at least one witness set, we deduce\nthat p = 1. The fact that p = 1 implies that u1 must even be adjacent to at least\ntwo unique witness sets from {W \u2032(y1), . . . ,W \u2032(y4)}, i.e., that are not adjacent\nto W \u2032(xi) \\ {u1}; otherwise we would have moved u1 and all components of\nG[W \u2032(xi)\\{u1}] not equal to L1 to W \u2032(y1)\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aW \u2032(y4). By the same arguments,\nexactly the same fact holds for u2 and u3. This is not possible, as three vertices\ncannot be adjacent to two unique sets out of four. uunionsq\n7\nWe need one additional result, which can be found in [14] but follows directly\nfrom the polynomial time result on minors in [16].\nLemma 2 ([14]). Let G be a graph and let Z1, . . . , Zp \u2286 VG be p specified\nnon-empty pairwise disjoint sets such that\n\u2211p\ni=1 |Zi| \u2264 k for some fixed integer\nk. The problem of deciding whether G is Kp-contractible with Kp-witness sets\nU1, . . . Up such that Zi \u2286 Ui for i = 1, . . . , p is polynomially solvable.\nUsing Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 we can prove the following result.\nTheorem 10. The H\u22174 (a1)-Contractibility problem is solvable in polyno-\nmial time for any fixed non-negative integer a1.\nProof. LetG = (V,E) be a connected graph. We guess a set S = {CW(xi, yj) | 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 a1, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 4} of connectors of size at most two. For each vertex u in each\nconnector CW(xi, yj) \u2208 S we pick a neighbor of u that is not in S and place it\nin a set Zj . This leads to four sets Z1, . . . , Z4. We remove S from G and call the\nresulting graph G\u2032. We check the following. First, we determine in polynomial\ntime whether Z1\u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u222aZ4 is contained in one component T of G\u2032. If so, we check\nwhether T is K4-contractible with K4-witness sets U1, . . . , U4 such that Zi \u2286 Ui\nfor i = 1, . . . , 4. This can be done in polynomial time due to Lemma 2. We then\ncheck whether the remaining components of G\u2032 together with the connectors\nCW(xi, yj) \u2208 S form witness sets W (xi) for i = 1, . . . , a1. Also, this can be done\nin polynomial time; there is only one unique way to do this because witness sets\nW (xi) are not adjacent to each other. If somewhere in the whole process we get\nstuck, we check another set S of connectors and start all over. Due to Lemma 1,\nit indeed suffices to consider only sets of connectors that have size at most two.\nHence, the total number of different 5-tuples (S, Z1, . . . , Z4) is bounded by a\npolynomial in a1, and consequently, the polynomial time result follows. uunionsq\n3.2 NP-Complete Cases With a Dominating Vertex\nWe show the existence of a class of graphs H with a dominating vertex such that\nH-Contractibility is NP-complete. To do this we need the following.\nProposition 1. Let H be a graph. If H-Induced Minor Containment is\nNP-complete, then so are (K1 on H)-Contractibility and (K1 on H)-Induced\nMinor Containment.\nProof. Let H and G be two graphs. Write K1 = ({x}, \u2205). We claim that the\nfollowing three statements are equivalent.\n(i) G has H as an induced minor;\n(ii) K1 on G is (K1 on H)-contractible;\n(iii) K1 on G has K1 on H as an induced minor.\n8\n\u201c(i) \u21d2 (ii)\u201d Suppose G has H as an induced minor. Then, by definition, G\ncontains an induced subgraph G\u2032 that is H-contractible. We extend an H-witness\nstructure W of G\u2032 to a (K1 on H)-witness structure of K1 on G by putting x\nand all vertices in VG \\ VG\u2032 in W (x). This shows that K1 on G is (K1 on H)-\ncontractible.\n\u201c(ii)\u21d2 (iii)\u201d Suppose K1 on G is (K1 on H)-contractible. By definition, K1 on G\ncontains K1 on H as an induced minor.\n\u201c(iii)\u21d2 (i)\u201d Suppose K1 on G has K1 on H as an induced minor. Then K1 on G\ncontains an induced subgraph G\u2217 that is K1 on H-contractible. Let W be a\n(K1 on H)-witness structure of G\u2217. If x \u2208 VG\u2217 , then we may assume without loss\nof generality that x \u2208W (x). We delete W (x) and obtain an H-witness structure\nof the remaining subgraph of G\u2217. This subgraph is an induced subgraph of G.\nHence, G contains H as an induced minor. uunionsq\nFellows et al. [8] showed that there exists a graph H\u00af on 68 vertices such that\nH\u00af-Induced Minor Containment is NP-complete; this graph is depicted in\nFigure 3. Combining their result with Proposition 1 (applied repeatedly) leads\nFig. 3. The graph H\u00af.\nto the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. For any i \u2265 1, (Ki on H\u00af)-Contractibility is NP-complete.\n4 The (H, v)-Contractibility Problem\nWe start with an observation. A star is a complete bipartite graph in which one\nof the partition classes has size one. The unique vertex in this class is called the\ncenter of the star. We denote the star on k + 1 vertices with center c and leaves\nb1, . . . , bp by Kp,1.\n9\nObservation 1 The (Kp,1, c)-Contractibility problem is polynomially solv-\nable for all p \u2265 1.\nProof. Let graph G = (V,E) and integer k form an instance of the (Kp,1, c)-\nContractibility problem. We may without loss of generality assume that\n|V | \u2265 k+ p. If G is Kp,1-contractible, then there exists a Kp,1-witness structure\nW of G such that |W (bi)| = 1 for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. This can be seen as follows. As\nlong as |W (bi)| \u2265 2 we can move vertices from W (bi) to W (c) without destroying\nthe witness structure. Our algorithm would just guess the witness sets W (bi) and\ncheck whether V \\ (W (b1) \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7W (bp)) induces a connected subgraph. As the\ntotal number of guesses is bounded by a polynomial in p, this algorithm runs in\npolynomial time. uunionsq\nWe expect that there are relatively few pairs (H, v) for which (H, v)-Con-\ntractibility is in P (under the assumption P 6= NP). This is due to the fol-\nlowing observation and the main result in this section that shows that (H, v)-\nContractibility is NP-complete whenever v is not a dominating vertex of\nH.\nObservation 2 Let H be a graph. If H-Contractibility is NP-complete, then\n(H, v)-Contractibility is NP-complete for every vertex v \u2208 VH .\nTheorem 11. Let H be a connected graph and let v \u2208 VH . The (H, v)-Contract-\nibility problem is NP-complete if v does not dominate H.\nProof. Let H be a connected graph, and let v be a vertex of H that does not dom-\ninateH. LetNH(v) denote the neighborhood of v inH. We partition VH\\{v} into\nthree sets V3 := VH \\(NH(v)\u222a{v}), V2 := {w \u2208 NH(v) | w is not adjacent to V3}\nand V1 := {w \u2208 NH(v) | w is adjacent to V3}. Note that neither V1 nor V3 is\nempty because H is connected and v does not dominate H; V2 might be empty.\nClearly, (H, v)-Contractibility is in NP, because we can verify in poly-\nnomial time whether a given partition of the vertex set of a graph G forms\nan H-witness structure of G with |W (v)| \u2265 k. In order to show that (H, v)-\nContractibility is NP-complete, we use a reduction from 3-SAT, which is\nwell-known to be NP-complete (cf. [10]). Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} be a set of vari-\nables and C = {c1, . . . , cm} be a set of clauses making up an instance of 3-SAT.\nLet X := {x | x \u2208 X}. We introduce two additional literals s and t, as well as\n2n additional clauses si := (xi \u2228 xi \u2228 s) and ti := (xi \u2228 xi \u2228 t) for i = 1, . . . , n.\nLet S := {s1, . . . , sn} and T := {t1, . . . , tn}. Note that all 2n clauses in S\u222aT are\nsatisfied for any satisfying truth assignment for C. For every vertex w \u2208 V1 we\ncreate a copy Xw of the set X, and we write Xw := {xw1 , . . . , xwn }. The literals\nsw, tw and the sets X\nw\n, Cw, Sw and Tw are defined similarly for every w \u2208 V1.\nWe construct a graph G such that C is satisfiable if and only if G has an\nH-witness structure W with |W (v)| \u2265 k. In order to do this, we first construct\na subgraph Gw of G for every w \u2208 V1 in the following way:\n\u2022 every literal in Xw \u222a Xw \u222a {sw, tw} and every clause in Cw \u222a Sw \u222a Tw is\nrepresented by a vertex in Gw\n10\nx\nw\n1\nx\nw\n2\nx\nw\n3 x\nw\nn\nx\nw\n1 x\nw\n2\nx\nw\n3\nx\nw\nn\ns\nw\nt\nw\nc\nw\n1\nc\nw\nm\ns\nw\n1\nt\nw\n1\ns\nw\nn\nt\nw\nn\n\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 \ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38 \ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\nL L L L L L\nFig. 4. A subgraph Gw, where cw1 = (x\nw\n1 \u2228 xw2 \u2228 xw3 ).\n\u2022 we add an edge between x \u2208 Xw \u222aXw \u222a {sw, tw} and c \u2208 Cw \u222a Sw \u222a Tw if\nand only if x appears in c;\n\u2022 for every i = 1, . . . , n\u22121, we add edges xwi xwi+1, xwi xwi+1, xwi xwi+1, and xwi xwi+1\n\u2022 we add edges swxw1 , swxw1 , twxwn , and twxwn\n\u2022 for every c \u2208 Cw \u222a Sw \u222a Tw, we add L vertices whose only neighbor is c;\nwe determine the value of L later and refer to the L vertices as the pendant\nvertices.\nSee Figure 4 for a depiction of subgraph Gw. For clarity, most of the edges\nbetween the clause vertices and the literal vertices have not been drawn. We\nconnect these subgraphs to each other as follows. For every w, x \u2208 V1, we add an\nedge between sw and sx in G if and only if w is adjacent to x in H. Let v\u2217 be some\nfixed vertex in V1. We add an edge between sv\n\u2217\n1 and s\nw\n1 for every w \u2208 V1 \\ {v\u2217}.\nNo other edges are added between vertices of two different subgraphs Gw and\nGx.\nWe add a copy of H[V2 \u222a V3] to G as follows. Vertex x \u2208 V2 is adjacent to\nsw in G if and only if x is adjacent to w in H. Vertex x \u2208 V3 is adjacent to both\nsw and tw in G if and only if x is adjacent to w in H. Finally, we connect every\nvertex x \u2208 V2 to sv\u22171 . See Figure 5 for an example.\nWe define L := (2 + 2n)|V1| + |V2| + |V3| + 1 and k := (L + 1)(m + 2n)|V1|.\nWe prove that G has an H-witness structure W with |W (v)| \u2265 k if and only if\nC is satisfiable.\nSuppose t : X \u2192 {T, F} is a satisfying truth assignment for C. Let XT\n(respectively XF ) be the variables that are set to true (respectively false) by t.\nFor every w \u2208 V1, we define XwT := {xwi | xi \u2208 XT } and X\nw\nT := {x | x \u2208 XwT };\nthe sets XwF and X\nw\nF are defined similarly. We define the H-witness sets of G as\nfollows. Let W (w) := {w} for every w \u2208 V2 \u222a V3, and let W (w) := {sw, tw} \u222a\nXwF \u222aX\nw\nT for every w \u2208 V1. Finally, let W (v) := VG \\ (\n\u22c3\nw\u2208V1\u222aV2\u222aV3 W (w)). Note\nthat for every w \u2208 V1 and for every i = 1, . . . , n, exactly one of xwi , xwi belongs\nto XwF \u222aX\nw\nT . Hence, G[W (w)] is connected for every w \u2208 V1.\n11\nH G\nv\nFig. 5. A graph H, where v\u2217 is the black vertex, and the corresponding graph G.\nSince t is a satisfying truth assignment for C, every cwi is adjacent to at\nleast one vertex of XwT \u222aX\nw\nF for every w \u2208 V1; by definition, this also holds for\nevery swi and t\nw\ni . This together with the edges between s\nv\u2217\n1 and s\nw\n1 for every\nw \u2208 V1 \\ {v\u2217} assures that G[W (v)] is connected. So the witness set G[W (w)] is\nconnected for every w \u2208 VH . By construction, two witness sets W (w) and W (x)\nare adjacent if and only if w and x are adjacent in H. Hence W := {W (w) | w \u2208\nVH} is an H-witness structure of G. Witness set W (v) contains n|V1| literal\nvertices, (m + 2n)|V1| clause vertices and L pendant vertices per clause vertex,\ni.e., |W (v)| = (L+ 1)(m+ 2n)|V1|+ n|V1| \u2265 k.\nSuppose G has an H-witness structure W with |W (v)| \u2265 k. We first show\nthat all of the (m+ 2n)|V1| clause vertices must belong to W (v). Note that for\nevery w \u2208 V1, the subgraph Gw contains 2 + 2n+ (L+ 1)(m+ 2n) vertices: the\nvertices sw and tw, the 2n literal vertices in Xw\u222aXw, the m+2n clause vertices\nand the L(m+ 2n) pendant vertices. Hence we have\n|VG| = (2 + 2n+ (L+ 1)(m+ 2n))|V1|+ |V2|+ |V3|.\nSuppose there exists a clause vertex c that does not belong to W (v). Then\nthe L pendant vertices adjacent to c cannot belong to W (v) either, as W (v) is\nconnected and the pendant vertices are only adjacent to c. This means that W (v)\ncan contain at most |VG|\u2212(L+1) = (L+1)(m+2n)|V1|\u22121 vertices, contradicting\nthe assumption that W (v) contains at least k = (L+ 1)(m+ 2n)|V1| vertices. So\nall of the (m+ 2n)|V1| clause vertices, as well as all the pendant vertices, must\nbelong to W (v).\nWe define Wi :=\n\u22c3\nw\u2208ViW (w) for i = 1, 2, 3 and prove four claims.\nClaim 1: V3 = W3.\nThe only vertices of G that are not adjacent to any of the clause vertices or\npendant vertices in W (v) are the vertices of V3. As W3 contains at least |V3|\nvertices, this proves Claim 1.\nClaim 2: For any w \u2208 V1, both sw and tw belong to W1.\nLet w be a vertex in V1, and let w\u2032 \u2208 V3 be a neighbor of w in H. Recall\nthat both sw and tw are adjacent to w\u2032 in G. Suppose that sw or tw belongs to\n12\nW (v) \u222aW2. By Claim 1, w\u2032 \u2208 W3. Then W (v) \u222aW2 and W3 are adjacent. By\nconstruction, this is not possible. Suppose that sw or tw belongs to W3. Then\nW3 and W (v) are adjacent, as sw and tw are adjacent to at least one clause\nvertex, which belongs to W (v). This is not possible.\nClaim 3: For any w \u2208 V1, at least one of each pair xwi , xwi of literal vertices\nbelongs to W (v).\nLet w \u2208 V1. Suppose there exists a pair of literal vertices xwi , xwi both of\nwhich do not belong to W (v). Apart from its L pendant vertices, the vertex twi\nis only adjacent to xwi , x\nw\ni and t\nw. The latter vertex belongs to W1 due to Claim\n2. Hence twi and its L pendant vertices induce a component of G[W (v)]. Since\nG[W (v)] contains other vertices as well, this contradicts the fact that G[W (v)]\nis connected.\nClaim 4: There exists a w \u2208 V1 for which at least one of each pair xwi , xwi of\nliteral vertices belongs to W1.\nLet S\u2032 := {sw | w \u2208 V1} and T \u2032 := {tw | w \u2208 V1}. By Claim 2, S\u2032 \u222a T \u2032 \u2286W1.\nSuppose, for contradiction, that for every w \u2208 V1 there exists a pair xwi , xwi of\nliteral vertices, both of which do not belong to W1. Then for any x \u2208 V1, the\nwitness set containing tx does not contain any other vertex of S\u2032 \u222a T \u2032, as there\nis no path in G[W1] from tx to any other vertex of S\u2032 \u222a T \u2032. But that means W1\ncontains at least |V1| + 1 witness sets, namely |V1| witness sets containing one\nvertex from T \u2032, and at least one more witness set containing vertices of S\u2032. This\ncontradiction to the fact that W1, by definition, contains exactly |V1| witness\nsets finishes the proof of Claim 4.\nLet w \u2208 V1 be a vertex for which of each pair xwi , xwi of literal vertices exactly\none vertex belongs to W1 and the other vertex belongs to W (v); such a vertex\nw exists as a result of Claim 3 and Claim 4. Let t be the truth assignment that\nsets all the literals of Xw\u222aXw that belong to W (v) to true and all other literals\nto false. Note that the vertices in Cw form an independent set in W (v). Since\nG[W (v)] is connected, each vertex cwi \u2208 Cw is adjacent to at least one of the\nliteral vertices set to true by t. Hence t is a satisfying truth assignment for C. uunionsq\n5 Open Problems\nThe most challenging task is to finish the computational complexity classifi-\ncation of both the H-Induced Minor Containment problem and the H-\nContractibility problem. With regards to the second problem, all previous\nevidence suggested some working conjecture stating that this problem is polyno-\nmially solvable if H contains a dominating vertex and NP-complete otherwise.\nHowever, in this paper we presented a class of graphs H with a dominating ver-\ntex for which H-Contractibility is NP-complete. This sheds new light on the\nH-Contractibility problem and raises a whole range of new questions.\n1. What is the smallest graph H that contains a dominating vertex for which\nH-Contractibility is NP-complete?\n13\nThe smallest graph known so far is the graph K1 on H\u00af, where H\u00af is the graph on\n68 vertices depicted in Figure 3. By Observation 2, we deduce that (K1 on H\u00af, v)-\nContractibility is NP-complete for all v \u2208 VK1onH\u00af . The following question\nmight be easier to answer.\n2. What is the smallest graph H that contains a dominating vertex v for which\n(H, v)-Contractibility is NP-complete?\nWe showed that (H, v)-Contractibility is NP-complete if H is connected and\nv does not dominate H. We still expect a similar result for H-Contractibility.\n3. Is the H-Contractibility problem NP-complete if H does not have a dom-\ninating vertex?\nLemma 1 plays a crucial role in the proof of Theorem 10 that shows that H\u22174 (a1)-\nContractibility is polynomially solvable. This lemma cannot be generalized\nsuch that it holds for the H\u2217i (a1)-Contractibility problem for i \u2265 5 and a1 \u2265\n2. Hence, new techniques are required to attack the H\u2217i (a1)-Contractibility\nproblem for i \u2265 5 and a1 \u2265 2.\n4. Is H\u22175 (a1)-Contractibility in P for all a1 \u2265 0?\nWe expect that the (H, v)-Contractibility problem is in P for only a few\ntarget pairs (H, v). One such class of pairs might be (Kp, v), where v is an ar-\nbitrary vertex of Kp. Using similar techniques as before (i.e., simplifying the\nwitness structure), one can easily show that (Kp, v)-Contractibility is poly-\nnomially solvable for p \u2264 3.\n5. Is (Kp, v)-Contractibility in P for all p \u2265 4?\nWe finish this section with some remarks on fixing the parameter k in an\ninstance (G, k) of the (H, v)-Contractibility problem.\nProposition 2. The (P3, p3)-Contractibility problem is in XP.\nProof. We first observe that any graph G that is a yes-instance of this problem\nhas a P3-witness structure W with |W (p1)| = 1. This is so, as we can move all\nbut one vertex from W (p1) to W (p2) without destroying the witness structure\n(see also Figure 1). Moreover, such a graph G contains a set W \u2217 \u2286 W (p3) such\nthat |W \u2217| = k and G[W \u2217] is connected. Hence we act as follows.\nLet G be a graph. We guess a vertex v and a set V \u2217 of size k. We put all\nneighbors of v in a set W2. We check if G[V \u2217] is connected. If so, we check for\neach y \u2208 VG \\ (V \u2217\u222aN(v)\u222a{v}) whether it is separated from N(v) by V \u2217 or not.\nIf so, we put y in V \u2217. If not, we put y in W2. In the end we check if G[W2] and\nG[V \u2217] are connected. If so, G is a yes-instance of (P3, p3)-Contractibility,\nas W (p1) = {v}, W (p2) = W2 and W (p3) = V \u2217 form a P3-witness structure of\nG with |W (p3)| \u2265 k. If not, we guess another pair (v, V \u2217) and repeat the steps\nabove. Since these steps can be performed in polynomial time and the total\nnumber of guesses is bounded by a polynomial in k, the result follows. uunionsq\n6.
