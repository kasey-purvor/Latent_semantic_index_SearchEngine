Famous examples are pipe flows,\nthermal convection, and the transition to chemical turbulence. On the theo-\nretical side, phase transitions in the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation are\namong the best understood theoretical examples for the role of instabilities in\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nEmail address: rademach@cwi.nl (Jens D.M. Rademacher).\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier 7 February 2007\ndissipative non-equilibrium systems, and yet there are still many unresolved\nchallenges in this \u201csimple\u201d model.\nIdentifying the onset of instability can present major computational challenges\ndue to the many active degrees of freedom that systems in large domains ex-\nhibit. An additional difficulty arises when convective transport mechanisms\ncause linearized operators to be non-normal, leading to ill-conditioned eigen-\nvalue problems where pseudo spectra become relevant [18], and to sensitive\ndependence on boundary conditions. One is then led to distinguish different\ntypes of instability: At the onset of convective instability, perturbations of a\ncoherent structure grow in norm but decay at each fixed point in space, and\nit is only at the subsequent onset of an absolute instability that perturbations\ngrow at each fixed point in physical space.\nBeyond this idealized characterization in an unbounded domain, it is often of\ninterest to determine the onset of instability in a large but bounded domain,\nwith boundaries formed by either physical boundaries or domain walls in the\npattern. In [13], we showed that the stability of coherent structures in such\nlarge but finite domains can be characterized using spectral information on the\nunbounded domain together with information on localized boundary modes:\nAs the size of the domain goes to infinity, spectra in large domains converge\nto a limiting set which is the disjoint union of a continuous part formed by\ncurves and a discrete part that consists of localized modes and resonance\npoles. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, the continuous part is\ngiven by the essential spectrum of the prevailing background pattern. In the\nmore typical case of separated boundary conditions, it is given by the absolute\nspectrum of this background state. Eigenvalues of the linearization in finite-\nsize domains accumulate at these spectral curves as the domain diameter\ngoes to infinity. The location of these curves is independent of the number\nand location of defects embedded in the regular pattern and of the imposed\nboundary conditions.\nOur goal in this paper is to provide efficient and accurate numerical proce-\ndures to determine the continuous part of the limiting spectrum. We will out-\nline algorithms that are based on complex extensions of Fourier and Laplace\ntransforms for spatio-temporally homogeneous background patterns, and on\nFloquet\u2013Bloch theory for spatio-temporally periodic background states. Know-\ning the location of all accumulation points of eigenvalues greatly simplifies the\ntask of computing the onset of instability: On the one hand, the convergence\nof eigenvalues away from the limiting curves is exponential in the domain size,\nso that accurate information can be gained by computations on only moder-\nately sized domains. On the other hand, the knowledge of the limiting curves\nmakes it possible to construct Cayley transforms in order to either avoid these\neigenvalue clusters on large domains and to resolve only isolated eigenvalues\nand resonance poles, or else to efficiently compute eigenvalues with maximal\n2\nreal part near the boundaries of these eigenvalue clusters.\nWe emphasize that, in many problems, the direct computation of spectra\non the large domain is either intractable or at least highly ill-conditioned.\nWhile computations of pseudo spectra often remedy some of these problems,\nessential and absolute spectra provide valuable additional information, which\nis, moreover, independent of the artificial cut-off choice for the norm of the\nresolvent, the size of the domain, and the particular boundary conditions.\nThe methods that we describe here have already been used to compute the\nonset of instability of coherent structures in reaction-diffusion systems, for\ninstance, in the computation of the onset of spiral breakup in [19,12] and\nin the numerical stability proof for wide pulses in a model for CO-oxidation\non Pt(110) surfaces [15]. We shall now outline these two applications in more\ndetail: The numerical computation of absolute spectra was exploited for the di-\nrect computation of linearized spectra of spiral waves in large disks: In [12], the\nabsolute spectrum of these two-dimensional vortex-like structures was com-\nputed using only the spectral properties of the emitted wave trains, utilizing\nthe continuation algorithm that we describe in this article. The results were\nthen exploited in [19] to construct suitable Cayley transforms for the direct\ncomputation of spectra of the elliptic linearized operator on the large disk\nusing subspace iterations. The large-scale spectral computations in [19] are in\nexcellent agreement with the predictions of the continuation algorithm in [12];\nsee [19, Figure 7]. In the second example, the stability of pulses with a wide\nplateau, which are obtained by gluing together widely separated fronts and\nbacks, was determined from the computation of the absolute spectrum of the\nplateau state [15]. Direct computations of spectra in large one-dimensional do-\nmains delivered only ambiguous results which depended heavily on the choice\nof boundary conditions and the relative size of plateau versus background\nstate [20,15].\nOne of the examples in this paper follows up on the spiral-wave computations\nby computing absolute stability boundaries of plane waves in the complex\nGinzburg\u2013Landau equation which arise as far-field patterns of vortices. We\nshow that wave trains may destabilize due to robust persistent reflection at\ngeneric boundaries on finite domains, while wave trains remain stable on the\nunbounded domain. In other words, there are parameter regions where pertur-\nbations of wave trains decay pointwise on the unbounded domain, but grow\nin norm on any finite domain for almost any boundary condition. The latter\nparameter regime provides a prominent example that pointwise stability does\nnot guarantee stability in large but finite domains. In particular, the crossing\nof double roots of the dispersion relation together with the pinching condi-\ntion that characterizes the onset of absolute instability in unbounded domains\n[1,17] is only a sufficient, yet not necessary, criterion for the onset of instability\nin finite-size domains.\n3\nTechnically, the present article considers reaction-diffusion patterns on large\nintervals as a prototype of spatially extended dissipative dynamical systems.\nThe methods however are readily adapted to much more general problems.\nTypically, the method assumes that the linearized problem can be written as a\nfamily of Fredholm operator equations L(\u03bb, \u03bd)w = 0 where w lives in a space of\nfunctions on a bounded (not large) domain. The equation L(\u03bb, \u03bd)w = 0 is ob-\ntained upon substituting the spatio-temporal Floquet\u2013Bloch ansatz u(t, x) =\nexp(\u03bbt + \u03bdx)w(t, x) into the original linearized problem, where the temporal\nfrequency \u03c9 = \u2212i\u03bb and the spatial wave number k = \u2212i\u03bd are typically com-\nplex. The continuation procedure outlined below can be readily adapted to\nthis type of problem, e.g., the Kuramoto\u2013Sivashinsky equation [11]. We give\ndetails for the implementation for one-dimensional boundary-value problems\nusing the continuation software auto. Alternatively, the package trilinos [7]\ncan be used which is optimized for large-scale systems. Problems where invert-\ning L involves the solution of boundary-value problems on multi-dimensional\ndomains can sometimes be approached using finite-dimensional Galerkin ap-\nproximations in the transverse components.\nTo set the scene, and to further explain the significance of absolute and essen-\ntial spectra, we review the most straightforward situation in which they arise.\nConsider reaction-diffusion systems\nut = Duxx + cux + f(u), x \u2208 R (1.1)\nwhere u \u2208 RN and f is smooth. To ensure that (1.1) is well-posed, we shall\nassume for simplicity throughout this paper that D is a positive diagonal\nmatrix. Suppose now that u\u2217(x) is a stationary solution of (1.1) so that\n|u\u2217(x)\u2212 u\u00b1(x)| \u2192 0 as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e\nwhere the asymptotic states u\u00b1(x) are constant or periodic in x. Linearizing\n(1.1) about u\u2217(x), we obtain the operator\nL\u2217 = D\u2202xx + c\u2202x + \u2202uf(u\u2217(x)) (1.2)\nwhose spectrum decides upon linear stability of the equilibrium u\u2217 as a solution\nof (1.1).\nThe spectrum of the operator (1.2) on L2(R,CN) is the disjoint union of the\nessential spectrum \u03a3ess and the point spectrum \u03a3pt which consists by definition\nof all isolated eigenvalues with finite multiplicity (and is therefore discrete).\nWhile the point spectrum involves the full nonlinear wave u\u2217, the boundary\nof the essential spectrum is determined entirely by the linearization of (1.1)\nabout the asymptotic states u\u00b1 [6, Appendix to \u00a75].\n4\nAlso of interest are finite but large domains of the form (\u2212`, `) with ` \u001d\n1. When considering (1.2) on (\u2212`, `), we add appropriate linear separated\nboundary conditions of the form\nQbc\u00b1\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed u(\u00b1`)\nux(\u00b1`)\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8 = 0, Qbc\u00b1 \u2208 R2N\u00d72N , rankQbc\u00b1 = N (1.3)\nat x = \u00b1`. While the spectrum \u03a3` of the operator L\u2217 on (\u2212`, `) is then\nnecessarily discrete for each finite `, we can still distinguish different parts\nin the limit ` \u2192 \u221e [13]: Generically, the set \u03a3` converges in the symmetric\nHausdorff distance to a limiting set \u03a3\u221e which again consists of a discrete\nand a continuous part. The discrete part is the union of the extended point\nspectrum \u03a3ext, which contains in particular the point spectrum \u03a3pt of the\nprofile u\u2217(x) on R, and the boundary spectrum \u03a3bc, which is generated by the\nboundary conditions (1.3). The continuous part is called the absolute spectrum\nwhich, in general, differs from the essential spectrum. As `\u2192\u221e, each element\nof the absolute spectrum is approached by infinitely many eigenvalues of L\u2217\nwhich therefore cluster near the absolute spectrum. As already alluded to,\nthe discrete part depends on the full profile u\u2217 and on the specific boundary\nconditions employed. The absolute spectrum, however, depends again only on\nthe asymptotic states u\u00b1, but not on the boundary conditions (as long as they\nare separated) or the profile u\u2217 [14].\nIn summary, the continuous parts of the spectrum of L\u2217 on R or (\u2212`, `) are\ndetermined by the asymptotic states u\u00b1 which, we assumed, are constant or\nperiodic in x. From now on, we shall therefore focus exclusively on operators\nwith constant or periodic coefficients.\nThe aim of this paper is to outline reliable and efficient ways to compute these\nspectra using cheap but accurate continuation algorithms without solving dis-\ncretized matrix eigenvalue problems on large domains. For the convenience of\nthe reader, we describe in some detail how our strategies can be implemented\nin the boundary-value solver auto [4]. We will also mention various exten-\nsions to compute linear spreading speeds and linear instability thresholds such\nas the boundary of Eckhaus instabilities.\nAs mentioned above, the methods presented here can be adapted to more\ngeneral problems. As a general rule, the continuation procedures should gen-\nerally be applicable to stability analyses of coherent structures in extended\nsystems, including dissipative systems as well as conservative or dispersive\nequations such as members of the Korteweg\u2013de Vries family or coupled non-\nlinear Schro\u00a8dinger equations, or higher order problems such as the Kuramoto\u2013\nSivashinsky equation. Some of our arguments can also be adapted to periodic\nstructures in higher space dimensions via Fourier and Bloch wave decomposi-\n5\ntion. We remark, however, that absolute spectra have not been used so far for\ngenuinely higher-dimensional problems.\n2 Notation and hypotheses\nWe consider the operator\nL := D\u2202xx + c\u2202x + a(x) (2.1)\nwhere we shall always assume that the entries dj of the diagonal matrix D =\ndiag(dj) are strictly positive for all j and that the coefficient matrix a(x) is\neither constant or periodic in x:\nHypothesis (C) The coefficients a(x) = a0 \u2208 RN\u00d7N do not depend on x.\nHypothesis (P) The coefficients a(x) \u2208 C1(R,RN\u00d7N) are periodic in x with\nminimal period L > 0.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, we shall always consider the operator L on\nR as a densely defined operator on L2(R,CN) with domain H2(R,CN). The\neigenvalue problem\nLu = Duxx + cux + a(x)u = \u03bbu (2.2)\ncan then also be written as\nux= v (2.3)\nvx=D\n\u22121[\u03bbu\u2212 cv \u2212 a(x)u]\nor equivalently as\nUx = [A(x) + \u03bbB]U (2.4)\nwhere U = (u, v) \u2208 C2N and\nA(x) =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed 0 1\n\u2212D\u22121a(x) \u2212cD\u22121\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8 , B =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed 0 0\nD\u22121 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8 .\n6\nSolutions to the eigenvalue problem (2.2) are therefore found by solving the\ninitial-value problem (2.3). For periodic coefficients, we denote by\n\u03a6\u03bb : C2N \u2212\u2192 C2N , (u0, v0) 7\u2212\u2192 \u03a6\u03bb(u0, v0) := (u, v)(L) (2.5)\nthe linear time-L map of (2.3) that associates to each initial condition (u0, v0)\nthe solution of (2.3) at time L. We refer to the eigenvalues of \u03a6\u03bb as spatial\nFloquet multipliers and to their logarithms as spatial Floquet exponents.\nNote that nonlinear periodic waves can be found as periodic solutions of the\nfirst-order system\nUx = F (U, c), F (U, c) =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed v\n\u2212D\u22121[f(u) + cv]\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8 (2.6)\nin the variables U = (u, v) \u2208 R2N . If u\u2217(x) denotes a constant or periodic\nsolution of (2.6), then a(x) = \u2202uf(u\u2217(x)) in (2.2).\nMost of the results presented here do not require that dj > 0 for all j. If\nsome of the diffusion coefficients vanish, however, we need that the speed c is\nnon-zero. Alternatively, if a concrete model has dj = 0 for one or more indices\nj, we may also set dj = \u03b4 for those indices with \u03b4 > 0 sufficiently small. The\nresults in [9, Chapter 3.2] show that the resulting spectra are continuous in \u03b4\nas \u03b4 \u2192 0 on any bounded subset of the complex plane C.\n3 Essential spectra\n3.1 Characterizing essential spectra via Bloch waves\nFor constant coefficients a(x) \u2261 a0, we consider the Fourier transformed op-\nerator\nL\u03bd := D\u03bd2 + c\u03bd + a0 : CN \u2192 CN (3.1)\nfor \u03bd \u2208 C. Since the Fourier transform is an isomorphism on L2(R,CN) which\nturns L into a multiplication operator, we immediately obtain the following\nlemma.\nLemma 3.1 For constant coefficients, we have\nspecL = \u222a\u03bd\u2208iRspecL\u03bd .\n7\nIn particular, the following assertions are equivalent:\n(i) \u03bb \u2208 specL;\n(ii) [D\u03bd2 + c\u03bd + a0 \u2212 \u03bb]u = 0 for some u \u2208 CN with u 6= 0 and some \u03bd \u2208 iR;\n(iii) d(\u03bb, \u03bd) := det(D\u03bd2 + c\u03bd + a0 \u2212 \u03bb) = 0 for some \u03bd \u2208 iR.\nWhile the third condition gives the most compact criterion, the second condi-\ntion is, in general, preferable for numerical computations.\nNote that the spectrum of the matrix L\u03bd consists for each \u03bd of precisely N\ntemporal eigenvalues \u03bbj, counted with multiplicity. Furthermore, the eigen-\nvalues \u03bbj can be continued globally in \u03bd since they are roots of the complex\nanalytic equation d(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0. The essential spectrum is obtained by restricting\nto purely imaginary \u03bd = i\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2208 R.\nLemma 3.2 For constant coefficients, the essential spectrum of L on R has at\nmost N connected components, each containing an eigenvalue \u03bbj of the matrix\na0 (when \u03b3 = 0) and the point at infinity. Furthermore, we have | arg \u03bb| \u2192 pi\nas |\u03b3| \u2192 \u221e in each connected component of the essential spectrum.\nWe remark that it is not difficult to derive expansions for the location of the\ncurves as |\u03b3| \u2192 \u221e.\nFor periodic coefficients a(x), there is a similar characterization. For each\n\u03bd \u2208 C, we define the Bloch-wave operator\nL\u03bd := D(\u2202x + \u03bd)2 + c(\u2202x + \u03bd) + a(x) (3.2)\nwhich is closed and densely defined on L2per(0, L) with periodic boundary con-\nditions u(0) = u(L) and ux(0) = ux(L).\nLemma 3.3 For periodic coefficients with minimal period L > 0, we have\nspecL = \u222a\u03bd\u2208i[0,2pi\/L)specL\u03bd .\nIn particular, the following assertions are equivalent:\n(i) \u03bb \u2208 specL;\n(ii) [D(\u2202x + \u03bd)\n2 + c(\u2202x + \u03bd) + a(x) \u2212 \u03bb]u = 0 for some u \u2208 H2per(0, L) and\nsome \u03bd \u2208 i[0, 2pi\/L);\n(iii) d(\u03bb, \u03bd) := det(\u03a6\u03bb \u2212 e\u03bdL) = 0 for some \u03bd \u2208 i[0, 2pi\/L).\nThe proof is a consequence of the Bloch-wave decomposition\nL2(R) \u223c= \u2295\u03bd\u2208i[0,2pi\/L)L2per(0, L)\n8\ngiven by the isomorphism\nu(x) =\n\u222b\n\u03bd\u2208i[0,2pi\/L)\ne\u03bdxw(x; \u03bd) d\u03bd,\nwhere u \u2208 L2(R) and w(x; \u03bd) = w(x + L; \u03bd) [16]. Since the direct compu-\ntation of the Floquet exponents \u03bd of the period map \u03a6\u03bb of the ODE (2.3) is\noften numerically unstable, condition (ii) is again preferable, from a numerical\nviewpoint, to the seemingly simpler condition (iii).\nThe operators L\u03bd have compact resolvent for each \u03bd, and their spectra con-\nsist therefore of isolated eigenvalues with finite multiplicity whose real parts\naccumulate at \u2212\u221e. In particular, we denote the countably many eigenvalues\nof L0 by \u03bbj, which we order so that their real parts decrease as j increases.\nThe roots \u03bbj of the complex analytic dispersion relation d(\u03bb, \u03bd) can again be\ncontinued globally in \u03bd = i\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2208 R. In particular, it suffices to solve\nfor \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 2pi\/L) since we necessarily have \u03bbj(2pii\/L) = \u03bb\u03a0(j)(0) for some\npermutation \u03a0 of N.\nLemma 3.4 For periodic coefficients, the essential spectrum of L on R is an\nat most countable union of connected sets, each of which contains a point in\nthe spectrum of L0, that is, an eigenvalue of the operator L considered on\n(0, L) with periodic boundary conditions.\nNote that the connected components do not need to contain a point at infinity.\nIsolas are possible, and the spectrum may not be connected on the Riemann\nsphere C (see, for instance, \u00a74.3 and \u00a75.2).\nLastly, we briefly comment on the effect of coordinate transformations of the\nform x 7\u2192 x\u2212c\u2217t which correspond to changing the frame of reference in which\nspectra are computed. For constant coefficients, the passage to a comoving\nframe \u03be = x \u2212 c\u2217t simply introduces an additional drift term c\u2217u\u03be in the\nexpression for L. Thus, the eigenvalues \u039b in the frame \u03be can be computed\nfrom solutions \u03bb(\u03bd) of d(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0 via \u039b = \u03bb(\u03bd)\u2212 c\u2217\u03bd. A similar result is true\nfor periodic coefficients though the equation becomes time-dependent, and we\ntherefore have to consider the period map \u03a8T of the linear PDE\nut = Du\u03be\u03be + (c+ c\u2217)u\u03be + a(\u03be + c\u2217t)u\nwith T = L\/c\u2217.\nProposition 3.5 ([14]) The essential spectrum of \u03a8T is of the form \u03c1 = e\n\u039bT\nwhere \u039b = \u03bb(\u03bd) \u2212 c\u2217\u03bd, and \u03bb(\u03bd), with \u03bd = i\u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 2pi\/L), satisfies\nd(\u03bb(\u03bd), \u03bd) = 0.\n9\nThus, the computation of spectra in an arbitrary frame reduces to the solution\nof an eigenvalue problem of the type considered above. Note that spectral\nstability does not depend on the coordinate frame since the real part of the\nspectrum is independent of the chosen frame by Proposition 3.5.\n3.2 A priori estimates\nSince we assumed that all diffusion constants dj are positive, a straightforward\nscaling result for both (C) and (P) shows that for each fixed \u03b4 \u2208 (0, pi\n2\n) there\nis a constant R > 0 so that L does not have any spectrum with |\u03bb| > R and\n| arg \u03bb| < pi\n2\n+ \u03b4.\nIt will turn out to be useful to consider the dispersion relations d(\u03bb, \u03bd) for\npurely imaginary temporal and spatial eigenvalues so that \u03bb = i\u03c9 and \u03bd = i\u03b3\nfor \u03c9, \u03b3 \u2208 R. We prove here that all real roots (\u03c9, \u03b3) of d(i\u03c9, i\u03b3) lie in bounded\nrectangles of R2 and provide estimates for these squares.\nFor constant coefficients, we assert (and refer to [9, Lemma 10] for the proof\nusing Gershgorin circles) that any real solution (\u03c9, \u03b3) of d(i\u03c9, i\u03b3) = 0 satisfies\n(\u03c9, \u03b3) \u2208 [\u2212|c|R0, |c|R0]\u00d7 [\u2212R0, R0]\nwhere\nR20 = max\n1\u2264j\u2264N\n1\ndj\n\uf8eb\uf8edajj + N\u2211\ni=1,i6=j\n|aij|\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 .\nFor periodic coefficients, we write L as the sum of the diagonal operator L0\nwith constant coefficients\nL0 = diag(dj)\u2202xx + c\u2202x + diag(ajj),\nwhere a =\n\u222b L\n0 a(x) dx, and the bounded remainder L1 which can be estimated\nin the operator norm on L2(R,CN) by\n\u2016L1\u2016 \u2264 sup\nx\u2208[0,L]\n|a(x)\u2212 diag(ajj)|,\nwhere the norm on the right-hand side is the matrix norm induced by the\nnorm used on CN (the Euclidean norm on CN , for instance, induces the matrix\n10\nnorm |A| =\n\u221a\n\u03c3(ATA) where \u03c3(B) denotes the spectral radius of the matrix\nB). Using the explicit resolvent estimate\n\u2016(\u03bb\u2212 L0)\u22121\u2016 \u2264 sup{| \u2212 djk2 + cik + ajj \u2212 \u03bb|\u22121; j = 1, . . . , N, k \u2208 R},\nwe see that the spectrum of L is contained in an \u2016L1\u2016-neighborhood of the\nspectrum\nspecL0 = {\u2212djk2 + cik + ajj; j = 1, . . . , N, k \u2208 R}\nof L0. Thus, any real root (\u03c9, \u03b3) of d(i\u03c9, i\u03b3) satisfies\n(\u03c9, \u03b3) \u2208 [\u2212|c|R1, |c|R1]\u00d7 [\u2212R1, R1]\nwhere\nR21 = max\n1\u2264j\u2264N\n1\ndj\n[\najj + \u2016L1\u2016\n]\n\u2264 max\n1\u2264j\u2264N\n1\ndj\n[\najj + sup\nx\u2208[0,L]\n|a(x)\u2212 diag(akk)|\n]\n.\nA rough estimate for the real parts therefore is\nRe spec(L) \u2264 max\n1\u2264j\u2264N\najj + sup\nx\u2208[0,L]\n|a(x)\u2212 diag(akk)|.\n3.3 Constant coefficients\n3.3.1 Computing essential spectra using continuation\nFor constant coefficients, we had seen that we can compute the essential spec-\ntrum of L by continuing the N temporal eigenvalues \u03bb of the matrix L\u03bd defined\nin (3.1) in the parameter \u03bd = i\u03b3. Thus, starting from \u03bd = 0, say, where the\ntemporal eigenvalues appear as eigenvalues of the matrix a0, we can use the\ncomplex normalized eigenvalue equation\n[\u2212D\u03b32 + ci\u03b3 + a0 \u2212 \u03bb]u = 0, \u3008uold, u\u3009 = 1, (3.3)\nwhere uold denotes the eigenvector from a previous infinitesimal step in the\ncontinuation parameter \u03b3 or the initially supplied solution at the beginning of\nthe continuation. The condition\n\u3008uold, u\u3009 = 1 (3.4)\n11\nis evaluated in the complex plane and therefore fixes the norm of the solution\nu and its complex phase. Such a condition is necessary as nontrivial solutions\nu to\n[\u2212D\u03b32 + ci\u03b3 + a0 \u2212 \u03bb]u = 0\nare, of course, not unique but come in group orbits {rei\u03b1u; \u03b1, r \u2208 R}. Equation\n(3.4) can be replaced by any other condition that fixes a unique element in\nthe group orbit of solutions. Bordering conditions similar to (3.4) will occur\nthroughout this paper to enforce uniqueness of solutions.\n3.3.2 Testing stability\nOften, the spectrum is only computed to check whether a given homogeneous\nequilibrium is stable (i.e. whether its essential spectrum lies completely in the\nopen left-half plane). For N = 2, the spectrum is strictly stable if, and only if,\n(i) det(a0) > 0 and tr(a0) < 0, and\n(ii) a022d1 + a\n0\n11d2 < 0 or (d1a\n0\n22 \u2212 d2a011)2 + 4d1d2a012a021 < 0\nwhere a0 = (a\n0\nij) (see e.g. [2]). For general N , connectedness of the essential\nspectrum on the Riemann sphere as stated in Lemma 3.2 immediately gives\nthe following stability criterion.\nLemma 3.6 The essential spectrum of L is contained in the open left-half\nplane if, and only if, it does not intersect the imaginary axis.\nRemark 3.7 When some of the diffusion coefficients dj vanish, then the\nequivalence stated in the lemma remains true provided c 6= 0 and all eigenval-\nues \u03bbj of a0 lie in the open left half-plane (curves with vertical asymptotes at\nsome Re(\u03bbj) occur).\nTo determine whether the essential spectrum intersects the imaginary axis, we\ndo not need to calculate the entire essential spectrum. It suffices to compute\nthe 2N spatial eigenvalues \u03bd for \u03bb \u2208 iR through continuation in \u03bb. The above\nlemma then states that the equilibrium is stable provided Re \u03bdj 6= 0 for all\n\u03bb \u2208 iR and each j = 1, . . . , 2N . A strategy for determining stability therefore\ngoes as follows:\n(i) Compute the 2N solutions \u03bdj(0) of d(0, \u03bd) = 0 and find the associated\nnontrivial solutions uj of the equation\n[D\u03bd2 + c\u03bd + a0]u = 0, |u| = 1.\n(ii) Follow each (\u03bdj, uj) as solutions to\n12\n[D\u03bd2 + c\u03bd + a0 \u2212 i\u03c9]u = 0, \u3008uold, u\u3009 = 1 (3.5)\nby continuation in \u03c9 \u2208 [0, |c|R0] with R0 as in \u00a73.2, starting at \u03c9 = 0.\n(iii) Stability is equivalent to Re \u03bdj(i\u03c9) 6= 0 for all \u03c9 \u2208 [0, |c|R0] and all j.\n3.3.3 Generic singularities\nWhen continuing roots \u03bb or \u03bd of d(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0 in the real parameters \u03bd = i\u03b3 or\n\u03bb = i\u03c9, it is of interest to know what the generic singularities are that one\nmay encounter. On the level of the dispersion relation, this question can be\neasily answered.\nContinuation of \u03bb in \u03bd = i\u03b3: We can always continue eigenvalues \u03bb as\nfunctions of \u03bd = i\u03b3 by the implicit function theorem unless \u2202\u03bbd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0.\nThus, suppose, without loss of generality, that \u2202\u03bbd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0 at \u03bb = \u03bd = 0 so\nthat\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = \u03b120\u03bb\n2 + \u03b101\u03bd +O(|\u03bd|2 + |\u03bb\u03bd|+ |\u03bb|3).\nIf \u03b120\u03b101 6= 0, then the Newton polygon shows that the solution set in \u03bd = i\u03b3\nis given locally by the curves\n\u03bb(i\u03b3) = \u00b1\n\u221a\n\u2212i\u03b3\u03b101\/\u03b120 +O(|\u03b3|) (3.6)\nfor \u03b3 \u2208 R close to zero. The coefficients \u03b120 and \u03b101 are real whenever the\nsingularity occurs for real \u03bb.\nDue to analyticity, the equations d = 0 and \u2202\u03bbd = 0 can be satisfied together\neither only at a discrete number of points (\u03bb, \u03bd) or else along curves. In the\nlatter case, at least two branches of the essential spectrum coincide and, by\nBe\u00b4zout\u2019s theorem, d and \u2202\u03bbd have a common factor, which is, for instance,\nprecluded if the diffusion rates are pairwise different [9, Lemma 10]. In the first\ncase, the number of isolated double roots, counted with multiplicity, is equal\nto the degree of the resultant of d(\u00b7, \u03bd) and \u2202\u03bbd(\u00b7, \u03bd) which is at most 2N(2N\u2212\n1). In particular, for generic systems, we will not encounter any singularities\nduring continuation in \u03bd = i\u03b3 since these should not occur for purely imaginary\n\u03bd. Thus, generically, we will be able to continue temporal eigenvalues in the\nreal parameter \u03b3 in a smooth fashion. A notable exception is the reversible\nsituation c = 0 where the dispersion relation depends analytically on \u03bd2 =\n\u2212\u03b32, so that temporal eigenvalues can collide on the real axis and split into\ncomplex conjugate pairs.\nContinuation of \u03bd in \u03bb = i\u03c9: To determine stability, we proposed to continue\n13\nthe 2N roots \u03bdj as functions of \u03bb = i\u03c9, whose singularities are of the form\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = \u03b110\u03bb+ \u03b102\u03bd\n2 +O(|\u03bd|3 + |\u03bb\u03bd|+ |\u03bb|2).\nIf d and \u2202\u03bdd have no common factors, the number of double roots is again\nfinite and, in fact, not larger than N(2N \u2212 1) by Lemma 4.5 below. The roots\n\u03bd unfold in the same way as the roots \u03bb in (3.6) above. Since these singularities\noccur for discrete values of \u03bb, they do typically not occur during continuation\nin \u03bb = i\u03c9.\n3.4 Periodic coefficients\n3.4.1 Continuation-based computation of the essential spectrum\nFor periodic coefficients, we can compute the essential spectrum of L by con-\ntinuing the countably many temporal eigenvalues \u03bbj of the Bloch-wave op-\nerators L\u03bd in the parameter \u03bd = i\u03b3. Supplementing the equation appearing\nin Lemma 3.3(ii) by an appropriate normalization condition, we obtain the\ncomplex boundary-value problem\n[\nD(\u2202x + i\u03b3)\n2 + c(\u2202x + i\u03b3) + a(x)\u2212 \u03bb\n]\nu(x)= 0 (3.7)\nL\u222b\n0\n\u3008uold(x), u(x)\u3009 dx=1,\nwhere uold is the solution at a previous continuation step or the initially sup-\nplied solution at the beginning of the computation. Note that the integral\ncondition is evaluated in the complex field C and therefore selects again an\nelement in the real two-dimensional group orbit.\nIf the linearization L arises from a translation invariant reaction-diffusion\nsystem as laid out in the introduction, then we typically need to solve the\nequation for the wave train and its temporal eigenvalues in tandem. Using the\nnotation from \u00a72 and normalizing the spatial period L to unity, we therefore\nconsider the boundary-value problem\nUx=LF (U, c) (3.8)\nVx=L[\u2202UF (U(x), c) + \u03bbB \u2212 \u03bd]V\nU(1)=U(0)\nV (1)=V (0)\n14\n1\u222b\n0\n\u3008U \u2032(x), Uold(x)\u2212 U(x)\u3009 dx=0\n1\u222b\n0\n\u3008Vold(x), V (x)\u3009 dx=1,\ncorresponding to the travelling-wave ODE (2.6) and the eigenvalue problem\n(3.7), for U \u2208 RN \u00d7 RN and V \u2208 CN \u00d7 CN . Here, (Uold, Vold)(x) denotes the\nsolution at a previous continuation step or the initial solution at the beginning\nof the continuation, and we have added appropriate phase and normalization\nconditions to fix an element in the group orbit of solutions. Note that the com-\nplex normalization condition for V is slightly different from the one used in\n(3.7) as it normalizes (u, ux) instead of only u. While theoretically equivalent,\nit turns out that one or the other may be more stable in numerical compu-\ntations. We also remark that computations often run more reliably when the\nlast equation in (3.8) is replaced by the nonlinear condition\n1\u222b\n0\n|V (x)|2 dx = 1,\n1\u222b\n0\nIm\u3008Vold(x), V (x)\u3009 dx = 0.\nWe now focus on the case where \u03bd = i\u03b3 is purely imaginary as this gives the\nessential spectrum. We remark, however, that the considerations below remain\ntrue for \u03bd \u2208 C.\nIf we are given a solution (U\u2217, V, \u03bb, i\u03b3) of (3.8), then we can continue this solu-\ntion numerically as a function of \u03bd = i\u03b3 by using a boundary-value solver such\nas auto. The generic singularities that we may encounter during continuation\nof (3.8) are identical to those for constant coefficients since both problems re-\nduce to a single analytic equation in two complex variables; in particular, we\ndo not expect that singularities arise during continuation in \u03b3.\nIt remains to find initial solutions (V, \u03bb, i\u03b3) of the eigenvalue-problem part\nof (3.8). Firstly note that, in the context of (3.8), \u03bb = 0 will always be an\neigenvalue of L0 with eigenfunction \u2202xu\u2217(x) due to translation invariance.\nThus, (U, V, \u03bb, \u03bd) = (U\u2217, \u2202xU\u2217, 0, 0) satisfies (3.8), and we can compute a curve\n\u03bb0(\u03bd) of solutions to d(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0 by continuation in \u03bd = i\u03b3 provided \u03bb = 0 is\na simple eigenvalue of L0.\nMore generally, we may discretize the operator L0 with periodic boundary con-\nditions using finite differences in space and solve the resulting matrix eigen-\nvalue problem using packages such as lapack or matlab. Each of the re-\nsulting temporal eigenvalues \u03bb together with its eigenfunction V can then be\nused, together with \u03b3 = 0, as an initial guess for (3.8).\n15\n3.4.2 Testing stability\nThe following lemma gives conditions that guarantee spectral stability of spa-\ntially periodic equilibria.\nLemma 3.8 The essential spectrum of L, with the exception of the eigenvalue\n\u03bb = 0, is contained in the open left-half plane provided the following conditions\nhold:\n(i) The spectrum of L0 is contained in the open left-half plane except for\nthe algebraically simple eigenvalue \u03bb = 0, and the curve \u03bb0(i\u03b3) satisfies\n\u03bb\u2032\u20320(0) > 0.\n(ii) The origin \u03bb = 0 is not an eigenvalue of L\u03bd for \u03bd = i\u03b3 6\u2208 2pii\/LZ.\n(iii) The spectrum of L does not intersect iR \\ {0}.\nTo verify (i), we compute the spectrum of L0 and check that the eigenvalue\n\u03bb = 0 is simple and that there are no other eigenvalues in the closed right-half\nplane. Afterward, we continue \u03bb = 0 in \u03bd = i\u03b3 near \u03b3 = 0 as outlined in the\npreceding section to see whether Re\u03bb0(i\u03b3) < 0 for \u03b3 6= 0 near zero.\nCondition (ii) is equivalent to the statement that the 2N spatial Floquet expo-\nnents \u03bdj of the linear time-L map \u03a6\u03bb=0 that we defined in (2.5) are non-zero\nexcept for a single simple exponent \u03bd1 = 0 that corresponds to the tempo-\nral eigenvalue \u03bb = 0. The exponents \u03bd for \u03bb = 0 coincide with the Floquet\nexponents of the linearization\nUx = L\u2202UF (U\u2217(x), c)U\nof the travelling-wave ODE about the wave train U\u2217, and condition (ii) is there-\nfore equivalent to hyperbolicity of the wave train as a periodic orbit of (2.6).\nauto, for instance, has subroutines that compute these Floquet exponents\ntogether with the wave train U\u2217.\nCondition (iii) can be checked as follows: Take the spatial Floquet exponents\n\u03bdj with j = 1, . . . , 2N of the wave train that were computed in the previous\nstep at \u03bb = 0. For each of the \u03bdj, we compute the corresponding Floquet\neigenfunction V by solving the linear boundary-value problem\nVx = L[\u2202UF (U\u2217(x), c)\u2212 \u03bd]V + \u000fH1(x), (3.9)\nV (1) = V (0),\n1\u222b\n0\n\u3008H2(x), V (x)\u3009 dx = 1\nfor (V, \u000f) with \u000f \u2208 C, where H1 and H2 are arbitrarily prescribed 1-periodic\ncontinuous functions. Note that (3.9) is linear in (V, \u000f), and it can been shown\n16\nthat it is uniquely solvable for any choice (H1, H2) except when these lie in\na certain subspace of C0([0, 1],C2N) of codimension one. Once we computed\na Floquet eigenfunction Vj for each \u03bdj at \u03bb = 0, we continue them in \u03c9 for\n\u03c9 \u2208 (0, |c|R0] with R0 as in \u00a73.2 as solutions (U\u2217, Vj, i\u03c9, \u03bdj) of (3.8). Condition\n(iii) is met provided Re \u03bdj 6= 0 for all \u03c9 \u2208 (0, |c|R0] and all j.\n3.4.3 Group velocities, and Eckhaus instabilities\nQuantities relevant for the interaction and stability of spatio-temporally peri-\nodic travelling waves are their group velocity\ncg := \u2212d\u03bb0\nd\u03bd\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03bd=0\n\u2208 R,\nwhich measures transport along the wave, and the coefficient\nd2\u03bb0\nd\u03bd2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03bd=0\n\u2208 R\nwhich determines whether the curve \u03bb0(i\u03b3) extends into the left or the right\nhalf-plane near the origin. Continuation of these quantities in systems pa-\nrameters allows us to detect sign changes of the group velocity and certain\nEckhaus instabilities, in particular of sideband type, where the onset is via\nzero wave-number [3].\nTo calculate the group velocity and the above coefficient, we consider the\nfirst-order system (2.3)\nUx = L[A(x) + \u03bbB]U, U(1) = e\ni\u03b3U(0), (3.10)\nfor U \u2208 C2N , with L again rescaled to unity or, equivalently, the system\nVx = L[A(x) + \u03bbB \u2212 i\u03b3]V, V (1) = V (0) (3.11)\nwhere U = ei\u03b3xV . We set\n\u03bb| :=\nd\u03bb0\nd\u03bd\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03bd=0\n, \u03bb|| :=\nd2\u03bb0\nd\u03bd2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03bd=0\n.\nDifferentiating (3.11) with respect to \u03bd = i\u03b3 and evaluating the resulting\nequations at \u03b3 = 0, we obtain the system\nV \u2032| =L[A(x)V| + (\u03bb|B \u2212 1)V ] (3.12)\n17\nV \u2032||=L[A(x)V|| + 2(\u03bb|B \u2212 1)V| + \u03bb||BV ]\non (0, 1) with periodic boundary conditions\nV|(0) = V|(1), V||(0) = V||(1) (3.13)\nfor V| := \u2202\u03bdV and V|| := \u22022\u03bdV both in R2N and (\u03bb|, \u03bb||) \u2208 R2. Lastly, we add\nthe integral conditions\n1\u222b\n0\n\u3008V (x), V|(x)\u3009 dx = 0,\n1\u222b\n0\n\u3008V (x), V||(x)\u3009 dx = 0, (3.14)\nwhich ensure that both V| and V|| are L2-orthogonal to the null space of the\nODE for V . We mention that the scalar products in the integral conditions\ncan, with V = (V (1), V (2)) \u2208 R2N , be replaced by the PDE scalar products\n1\u222b\n0\n\u3008V (1)(x), V (1)| (x)\u3009 dx = 0,\n1\u222b\n0\n\u3008V (1)(x), V (1)|| (x)\u3009 dx = 0,\nwhich are sometimes computationally more stable and reliable. The system\n(3.8), (3.12)-(3.14) with \u03bb = \u03bd = 0 can now be solved uniquely for (U, c),\n(V, V|, V||) and (\u03bb|, \u03bb||). Alternatively, using nontrivial solutions V (x) andW (x)\nof\nVx = LA(x)V, V (0) = V (1), Wx = \u2212LA(x)tW, W (0) = W (1)\nand finding \u03bb| and V\u02dc (x) so that\nV\u02dcx = L[A(x)V\u02dc + (\u03bb|B \u2212 1)V ], V\u02dc (0) = V\u02dc (1),\nwe have\n\u03bb| =\n\u3008W,V \u3009L2\n\u3008W,BV \u3009L2 , \u03bb|| =\n\u3008W, 2(\u03bb|B \u2212 1)V\u02dc \u3009L2\n\u3008W,BV \u3009L2 .\n3.5 Implementation in AUTO\nWe now discuss briefly how the strategies that we outlined above can be\nimplemented in the continuation package auto and refer to the names of\nroutines and constants as given in [4]; we write source code in fortran syntax.\n18\nSince auto uses only real arithmetics, dimension counting will always be done\nover the real numbers (unless explicitly stated otherwise).\n3.5.1 Periodic coefficients\nImplementing the system (3.8) in auto works as follows.\nThe constants file: Equation (3.8) is a boundary-value problem, and we\ntherefore set ips=4. The ODEs appearing in (3.8) involve 6N real unknowns,\nnamely (U, V ) \u2208 R2N \u00d7 C2N , and we therefore set ndim=6N. We have nbc=6N\nreal boundary conditions and nint=3 real integral conditions. Since the ODEs\ncan be solved uniquely upon choosing initial conditions, we have effectively\n6N + 3 real equations and hence need the same number of variables plus one\nfor continuation which gives 6N + 4. In addition to the 6N initial data for\n(U, V ), we have five real parameters at our disposal, namely c, L, \u03b3 \u2208 R and\n\u03bb \u2208 C. Thus, we may fix the period L and use the four parameters \u03b3, c \u2208 R and\n\u03bb \u2208 C for continuation by setting nicp=4 and specifying the four parameters\nin the array icp. It may be helpful for convergence to increase the number of\nNewton iterations itnw from its default value.\nThe equations file: The unknowns (U,ReV, ImV ) \u2208 R2N \u00d7 R2N \u00d7 R2N are\nstored in U(1),. . . ,U(6N), the period L in par(11), and we use par(1), . . . ,\npar(4) for c, \u03b3, Re\u03bb, Im\u03bb. The periodic boundary conditions are defined in\nthe subroutine bcnd via\ndo j=1,ndim\nfb(j) = U0(j) - U1(j)\nend do\nThe integral conditions are defined in icnd. We set\nfi(1) = 0.0\ndo j=1,ndim\/3\nfi(1) = fi(1) + UPOLD(j) * (UOLD(j)-U(j))\nend do\nfor the phase condition of the wave train U , and use\nfi(2) = -1.0\nfi(3) = 0.0\ndo j=ndim\/3+1,2*ndim\/3\nfi(2) = fi(2) + U(j)*U(j) + U(j+ndim\/3)*U(j+ndim\/3)\nfi(3) = fi(3) + UOLD(j)*U(j+ndim\/3) - UOLD(j+ndim\/3)*U(j)\nend do.\n19\nfor the normalization of the eigenfunction V .\nInitial data: We assume that the period L, the wave train U\u2217 = (u\u2217, u\u2032\u2217) and\nthe associated wave speed c are known. These can be obtained, for instance,\nfrom direct PDE simulations or from continuation in the travelling-wave ODE\n(2.6) beginning at a Hopf bifurcation point. We also assume that we found\ninitial solutions for \u03bb, \u03b3 and the associated eigenfunction V (see \u00a73.4.1). This\ninformation needs to be stored in the subroutine stpnt or an external data\nfile that can be read by auto (see [4]). It is recommended to scale the initial\nguess for the eigenfunction to have norm one so that it satisfies the integral\ncondition; otherwise, convergence may be be quite slow.\nSolving (3.9) and (3.12): We discuss now how equation (3.9) is solved to\nget the Floquet eigenfunction V for a given Floquet exponent \u03bd. First, we pick\nfunctionsH1 andH2 (for instance, constant functions). Note that (3.9) involves\ntwo real integral conditions and a real two-dimensional parameter \u000f. We fix\n\u03bd and continue instead in the real two-dimensional \u000f and the unused dummy\nparameter par(9): continuation in a dummy parameter in auto allows us to\nsolve a linear or nonlinear system through Newton\u2019s method. Next, we continue\nto Re \u000f = 0 using Im \u03bd as additional free parameter. Lastly, we continue to\nIm \u000f = 0 using \u03bd as free parameter.\nEquation (3.12) is solved analogously. It is affine in (V|, V||, \u03bb|, \u03bb||) \u2208 R2N \u00d7\nR2N \u00d7R2, and therefore almost any initial guess (for instance, constant func-\ntions) for (V|, V||, \u03bb|, \u03bb||) will give the correct solution by continuing in the\ndummy parameter par(9) and the active parameters (\u03bb, \u03bb|, \u03bb||) \u2208 C \u00d7 R2,\nstarting at \u03bb = \u03bd = 0. We recommend to exclude V|, V|| from the pseudo-\narclength computation by setting nthu=4N followed by 4N lines of the form\n<index of component> 0.\n3.5.2 Constant coefficients\nThe implementation for constant coefficients is similar to the one for periodic\ncoefficients discussed above. While the eigenvalue problem (3.3) is only an\nalgebraic equation, it is recommended to implement it as a boundary-value\nproblem as in \u00a73.5: this is done by setting ips=4 and choosing ntst=1 and\nncol=2. In the following, we shall only comment on the differences to the\nimplementation for periodic coefficients.\nThe constants file: Unless the equilibrium is to be continued in a parameter,\nwe do not need to solve the nonlinear problem simultaneously. In this case,\nwe have two integral conditions, three free parameters (\u03b3 \u2208 R and \u03bb \u2208 C),\nand the unknowns u \u2208 CN stored in U(1),. . . ,U(2N) in auto. (It may also be\nconvenient to use the files from the periodic case in the first-order formulation\nwith U \u2208 C2N .) We recommend to disable mesh adaption by setting iad=0.\n20\nInitial data: Initial data for \u03bb, \u03bd and the eigenvector u (or U = (u, ux))\ncan be imported from root-solving routines in packages such as maple or\nmathematica applied to the dispersion relation d(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0 for a fixed value\nof either \u03bb or \u03bd.\n4 Absolute spectra\n4.1 Definition and characterization of the absolute spectrum\nAs outlined in the introduction, the absolute spectrum arises naturally as\nfollows: Take the linearization L about an asymptotically homogeneous or a\nperiodic travelling wave and compute its spectrum on the interval (\u2212`, `) with\nfixed separated boundary condition at x = \u00b1`. The resulting spectra will\ndepend on ` and on the boundary conditions. It is proved in [13] that these\nspectra converge, uniformly on compact subsets of C and in the symmetric\nHausdorff distance, to a limiting spectral set as `\u2192\u221e. The continuous (non-\ndiscrete) part of the limiting set is given by the absolute spectrum \u03a3abs, defined\nbelow in Definition 1, which does not depend on the boundary conditions: As\n` \u2192 \u221e, each element of the absolute spectrum is approached by infinitely\nmany eigenvalues of L which therefore cluster near the absolute spectrum. We\nemphasize that the results in [13], even though mostly formulated for constant\ncoefficients, are valid for periodic coefficients.\nDefinition 1 For constant coefficients, we define the generalized absolute spec-\ntrum \u03a3mabs with Morse index m as the set of those \u03bb \u2208 C for which\nRe \u03bd1 \u2265 . . . \u2265 Re \u03bdm = Re \u03bdm+1 \u2265 . . . \u2265 Re \u03bd2N\nwhere \u03bdj are the 2N roots of d(\u03bb, \u03bd) repeated with multiplicity. The generalized\nabsolute spectrum\n\u03a3\u2217abs :=\n2N\u22121\u22c3\nm=1\n\u03a3mabs.\nis the union over all indices m, and the absolute spectrum is defined as\n\u03a3abs := \u03a3\nN\nabs.\nFor periodic coefficients, we use the same definition with the eigenvalues \u03bd\nreplaced by the Floquet exponents of \u03a6\u03bb.\n21\nBoth notations \u03a3abs and \u03a3\nN\nabs for the absolute spectrum will be used inter-\nchangeably. The generalized absolute spectrum with Morse index different\nfrom N is usually meaningless for spectral properties of L from (2.1). It is,\nhowever, a natural first step towards the computation of the absolute spec-\ntrum. Note that each \u03a3mabs is typically the union of curve segments that are\nglued together at singularities that we shall discuss in detail below. First, we\nnote the absolute spectrum is also bounded to the right:\nRemark 4.1 For both (C) and (P), a scaling result shows that for each fixed\n\u03b4 \u2208 (0, pi\n2\n) there is a constant R > 0 so that \u03a3Nabs does not contain any elements\n\u03bb with |\u03bb| > R and | arg \u03bb| < pi\n2\n+ \u03b4.\nThe characterization of \u03a3\u2217abs in Definition 1 allows us to reformulate \u03a3\n\u2217\nabs using\nthe system\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd1) = 0, d(\u03bb, \u03bd2) = 0, \u03bd2 \u2212 \u03bd1 = i\u03b3 (4.1)\nwith \u03b3 \u2208 R. We see that \u03bb \u2208 \u03a3\u2217abs if either (\u03bb, \u03bd1, \u03bd2) are solutions of (4.1)\nfor some non-zero real \u03b3 or else if \u03bb and \u03bd1 = \u03bd2 are solutions of (4.1) with\n\u2202\u03bdd(\u03bb, \u03bd1) = 0. Setting \u03bd = \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 = \u03bd + i\u03b3, we can remove the singularity\nof (4.1) at \u03b3 = 0 by considering the system\nA(\u03bb, \u03bd; \u03b3) =\n(\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd),\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd)\u2212 d(\u03bb, \u03bd + i\u03b3)\ni\u03b3\n)\n= 0 (4.2)\nso that A : C \u00d7 C \u00d7 R \u2192 C2 and A(\u03bb, \u03bd; 0) = (d(\u03bb, \u03bd), d\u03bd(\u03bb, \u03bd)). Thus,\n\u03bb \u2208 \u03a3\u2217abs if, and only if, (\u03bb, \u03bd; \u03b3) satisfies (4.2). We shall call solutions (\u03bb, \u03bd)\nof A(\u03bb, \u03bd; 0) = 0 double roots.\nIn practice, it is often not feasible, or numerically not stable, to use the formu-\nlations (4.1) or (4.2) directly. Instead, it is typically more convenient to work\nwith the original algebraic or differential system that leads to the solvability\nconditions (4.1) or (4.2), and we give those systems in \u00a74.2.4 and \u00a74.3.\n4.2 Constant coefficients\nIn \u00a74.2.1-\u00a74.2.3, we collect various useful properties of the absolute spectrum\nbefore commenting on the practical implementation of the continuation algo-\nrithm in \u00a74.2.4.\n22\n4.2.1 Continuation within the generalized absolute spectrum\nWe first collect several properties of the system A(\u03bb, \u03bd; \u03b3) = 0. For each iso-\nlated solution (\u03bb, \u03bd) of A(\u03bb, \u03bd; \u03b3) = 0 for some fixed \u03b3 \u2265 0, we can define its\nmultiplicity to be the (real) Brouwer degree deg(A(\u00b7, \u00b7; \u03b3), 0) in the variable\n(\u03bb, \u03bd) evaluated at the solution (\u03bb, \u03bd).\nLemma 4.2 The multiplicity is non-negative, and the multiplicity of an iso-\nlated double root (\u03bb, \u03bd) is one precisely when \u2202\u03bbd(\u03bb, \u03bd) 6= 0 and \u2202\u03bd\u03bdd(\u03bb, \u03bd) 6= 0.\nProof. Since the derivative \u2202(\u03bb,\u03bd)A is complex linear, it has a non-negative\ndeterminant when considered as a real 4 \u00d7 4 matrix which proves the first\nclaim. The second statement follows since \u2202(\u03bb,\u03bd)A is, in this case, block lower\ntriangular with diagonal entries given as non-zero complex multiples of the\nidentity, such that det \u2202(\u03bb,\u03bd)A > 0.\nWe say that an isolated double root is simple if it has multiplicity one. If a\nsolution is not isolated, we say it has multiplicity \u221e.\nIn the following, we consider various homotopies by allowing the coefficients\nD, c, a0 and \u03b3 to depend on a homotopy parameter \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1]. The resulting\nfunctions will be denoted by A\u03c4 (\u03bb, \u03bd), omitting the dependence on \u03b3 = \u03b3(\u03c4).\nThe homotopy invariance of the Brouwer degree gives the following result.\nLemma 4.3 The number of solutions (\u03bb, \u03bd) of A\u03c4 (\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0 inside a ball\nG \u2282 C2, counted with multiplicity, is independent of \u03c4 provided there are no\nroots on the boundary \u2202G for each \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1].\nNext, we prove that the assumption in the preceding lemma is automatically\nmet provided the ball G has sufficiently large diameter.\nLemma 4.4 If the diffusion coefficients are pairwise distinct so that di 6= dj\nfor i 6= j, then there exists a number R > 0, depending only on |D|, |a0|, |c|\nand |\u03b3|, such that every solution (\u03bb, \u03bd1, \u03bd2) of (4.1) satisfies\n|\u03bb|+ |\u03bd1|+ |\u03bd2| \u2264 R.\nProof. Suppose that the claim is wrong so that, for a certain fixed \u03b3, there\nare solutions (\u03bb, \u03bd) of (4.1) for which |\u03bb|, |\u03bd1|, or |\u03bd2| are arbitrarily large.\nIn this case, a straightforward estimate of the equation d(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0 shows\nthat |\u03bd| \u2261 \u00b1\n\u221a\n\u03bb\/di for some i as |\u03bb| or |\u03bd| tend to infinity. Since di 6= dj for\ni 6= j, this implies | Im(\u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd2)| \u2192 \u221e whenever Re \u03bd1 = Re \u03bd2, and therefore\n|\u03b3| \u2192 \u221e as well. This contradicts the assumption that \u03b3 is fixed and therefore\nshows that (\u03bb, \u03bd1, \u03bd2) stays in a bounded region.\nLemma 4.5 Assume that di 6= dj for i 6= j, then there are precisely N(2N\u22121)\n23\ndouble roots, i.e. solutions to A(\u03bb, \u03bd; 0) = 0, when counted with multiplicity.\nProof. We choose a homotopy of A(\u03bb, \u03bd; 0) = 0 to the equation with c = 0\nand a = diag(aj). On account of Lemmata 4.3 and 4.4, the number of roots\nof A\u03c4 (\u03bb, \u03bd; 0) does not change during the homotopy. The resulting diagonal\nequation has the N double roots (\u03bb, \u03bd) = (aj, 0) which are easily seen to have\nmultiplicity one. The remaining double roots are solutions to\ndi\u03bd\n2 + ai \u2212 \u03bb = 0, dj\u03bd2 + aj \u2212 \u03bb = 0,\nthat is, to\n\u03bb = di\u03bd\n2 + ai, \u03bd\n2 = \u2212ai \u2212 aj\ndi \u2212 dj\nfor a given pair (i, j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N . Choosing the aj appropriately, the\nabove system has N(N \u2212 1) distinct solutions. We claim that each solution\nhas Brouwer degree equal to 2. Indeed, differentiating the dispersion relation\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = \u03a0Nj=1[\u03bb\u2212 dj\u03bd2 \u2212 aj]\nand computing the Taylor jet at the solutions (\u03bb\u2217, \u03bd\u2217), we obtain\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = a(\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb\u2217)2 \u2212 b(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd\u2217)2 +O(3)\nwith a 6= 0. In particular, d(\u03bb, \u03bd) + \u03b5 has two simple double roots at \u03bb =\n\u03bb\u2217 \u00b1\n\u221a\n\u03b5\/a + O(\u000f) and \u03bd = \u03bd\u2217. The additivity and homotopy invariance of\nthe degree shows that the multiplicity is two. Altogether, we have found N +\n2N(N \u2212 1) = N(2N \u2212 1) roots which proves the lemma.\nWe can now show that the generalized absolute spectrum consists of at most\nN(2N \u2212 1) curves that are parameterized by \u03b3:\nProposition 4.6 The generalized absolute spectrum is given by\n\u03a3\u2217abs =\n\u22c3\n\u03b3\u22650\n{\u03bbj(\u03b3); j = 1, . . . , N(2N \u2212 1)} ,\nwhere \u03bbj(\u03b3) denotes the \u03bb-component of the solutions to A(\u03bb, \u03bd; \u03b3) = 0. More-\nover, \u03bbj(\u03b3) can be chosen to be continuous in \u03b3. In particular, \u03a3\n\u2217\nabs consists of\nat most N(2N \u2212 1) connected components, each containing a double root and\nthe point at infinity (when considered on C).\n24\nProof. The representation of \u03a3\u2217abs follows from the previous discussion and\nthe homotopy invariance of the degree in a ball of radius R near each fixed\nfinite \u03b3, and therefore for all \u03b3. To prove continuity, we have to show that the\nset C := {(\u03bb, \u03bd, \u03b3); A(\u03bb, \u03bd; \u03b3) = 0} is the union of N(2N\u22121) continuous curves\n(\u03bbj, \u03bdj)(\u03b3). It suffices to prove this property locally, and we therefore work in\na fixed box B = B(\u03bb,\u03bd)\u00d7B\u03b3 \u2282 C2\u00d7R+ near a given root (\u03bb\u2217, \u03bd\u2217, \u03b3\u2217) of A with\nmultiplicity r. By Sard\u2019s theorem, there exists a sequence ck \u2208 C2 with ck \u2192 0\nas k \u2192\u221e so that each ck is a regular value of A : C2\u00d7R+ \u2192 C2. In particular,\nthe preimages A\u22121(ck) \u2229 B are smooth one-dimensional submanifolds, and\ntherefore the disjoint union of one-dimensional embedded curves. We claim\nthat each of these curves can be parameterized by \u03b3: Indeed, if this were\nnot possible, we would readily obtain a contradiction to the fact that there\nare precisely r roots of A(\u00b7, \u00b7; \u03b3) in B(\u03bb,\u03bd) for each fixed \u03b3 \u2208 B\u03b3 by degree\narguments. Thus, for each k, we can parameterize the roots of A inside B by\nr disjoint continuous curves (\u03bb\n(k)\nj , \u03bd\n(k)\nj )(\u03b3), and taking the limit k \u2192\u221e gives\nthe desired characterization of \u03a3\u2217abs.\nTo summarize, to compute the generalized absolute spectrum, it suffices to\ncalculate all double roots and to subsequently continue the curves of \u03a3\u2217abs that\nemanate from the double roots in \u03b3 from \u03b3 = 0 to \u03b3 =\u221e.\nWe remark that double roots may coalesce in certain situations:\nLemma 4.7 If a is triangular and N \u2265 2, then there are at least two degener-\nate double roots (\u03bb\u2217, \u03bd\u2217) of the dispersion relation which are double roots with\nrespect to both \u03bd and \u03bb so that\nd(\u03bb\u2217 + \u03bb, \u03bd\u2217 + \u03bd) = \u03b120\u03bb2 + \u03b102\u03bd2 +O(|\u03bb|3 + |\u03bd|3).\nProof. It suffices to consider N = 2, D = (1, \u03b4) with \u03b4 6= 0, and a =\n(\na1 \u2217\n0 a2\n)\nin which case the dispersion relation is equal to d(\u03bb, \u03bd) = d1(\u03bb, \u03bd)d2(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0\nwith d1(\u03bb, \u03bd) = \u03bd\n2+ c\u03bd\u2212\u03bb+a1 and d2(\u03bb, \u03bd) = \u03b4\u03bd2+ c\u03bd\u2212\u03bb+a2. In particular,\nthere are\n(\n4\n2\n)\n= 6 double roots for \u03b4 6= 1 which satisfy d = 0 and \u2202\u03bdd =\n(\u2202\u03bdd1)d2 + d1\u2202\u03bdd2 = 0.\nThe solutions to d1 = 0 and d2 = 0 are given by \u03bb1 = \u03bd\n2 + c\u03bd + a1 and\n\u03bb2 = \u03b4\u03bd\n2+ c\u03bd+a2, respectively, where \u03bd is arbitrary. These give rise to spatial\ndouble roots provided d2(\u03bb1, \u03bd) = 0 or d1(\u03bb2, \u03bd) = 0, respectively, that is,\nwhen \u03b4\u03bd2 + c\u03bd \u2212 (\u03bd2 + c\u03bd + a1) + a2 = 0 or \u03bd2 + c\u03bd \u2212 (\u03b4\u03bd2 + c\u03bd + a2) + a1 = 0.\nThis is the case for \u03bd\u00b1j = \u00b1\n\u221a\n(\u22121)j a2\u2212a1\n1\u2212\u03b4 . The remaining two of the six double\nroots are the roots \u03bd1 = \u2212 c2 and \u03bd2 = \u2212 c2\u03b4 of the dispersion relations d1 and\nd2, respectively.\nIf some of the diffusion coefficients are equal (di = dj for appropriate indices\ni 6= j), we cannot a priori exclude that branch points \u2019disappear\u2019 at infinity. In\n25\nfact, in the explicit decoupled model problem that we utilized in the proof of\nLemma 4.5, a double branch point \u2019crosses\u2019 the point at infinity when di \u2212 dj\ncrosses zero.\n4.2.2 Testing absolute stability\nWe shall show that, for constant-coefficient operators, the absolute spectrum\n\u03a3Nabs is connected in C. Since Remark 4.1 shows furthermore that it lies in\nan acute sector that opens up along the negative real axis, it suffices to check\nwhether the absolute spectrum has a non-zero intersection with the imaginary\naxis to establish stability or instability.\nLemma 4.8 The absolute spectrum \u03a3Nabs is connected in C and contains the\npoint at infinity. Furthermore, the absolute spectrum \u03a3Nabs is contained in the\nopen left half-plane if, and only if, it does not intersect the imaginary axis.\nProof. We argue by contradiction. Thus, suppose that \u03a3\u02dc is a non-empty,\ncompact subset of \u03a3Nabs so that there is a smooth Jordan curve \u0393 in C with\n\u0393 \u2229 \u03a3Nabs = \u2205 and int \u0393 \u2229 \u03a3Nabs = \u03a3\u02dc. The idea is to show that the spectrum of\nL on (\u2212`, `) with appropriate boundary conditions cannot accumulate on \u03a3\u02dc\nas `\u2192\u221e in contradiction to [13, Theorem 5]. Since \u0393 does not intersect the\nabsolute spectrum with Morse index N , the eigenvalues \u03bdj of A+ \u03bbB satisfy\nRe \u03bd1 \u2265 . . . \u2265 Re \u03bdN > Re \u03bdN+1 \u2265 . . . \u2265 Re \u03bd2N\nfor all \u03bb \u2208 \u0393. We denote the N -dimensional generalized eigenspaces associated\nwith the N smallest and largest eigenvalues of A+ \u03bbB in the above ordering\nby Es(\u03bb) and Eu(\u03bb), respectively: These spaces are well defined, unique and\nanalytic in \u03bb for \u03bb in a neighbourhood U of \u0393. Next, pick \u03bb0 \u2208 \u0393 and an\nN -dimensional subspace Ebc with\nEbc \u2295 Eu(\u03bb) = C2N , Ebc \u2295 Es(\u03bb) = C2N (4.3)\nfor \u03bb = \u03bb0. Analyticity then implies that (4.3) is true for all \u03bb \u2208 U except\npossibly for finitely many \u03bb. Redefining \u0393 if necessary, we can therefore assume\nthat (4.3) is true for all \u03bb \u2208 \u0393.\nWe set our boundary conditions by choosing a matrix Qbc\u2212 = Q\nbc\n+ with null\nspace equal to Ebc. Equation (4.3) shows that [13, Hypothesis 7] is met, and\n[13, Proposition 5] now asserts that there are numbersM \u2265 0 and `\u2217 \u001d 1 such\nthat the spectrum of L on (\u2212`, `) with the boundary conditions (1.3) cannot\nintersect \u0393 for ` \u2265 `\u2217 and contains precisely M elements in the interior of \u0393\nfor ` = `\u2217. Thus, the number of eigenvalues in the interior of \u0393 is equal to M\n26\nfor all ` \u2265 `\u2217. We emphasize that (4.3), and therefore the above statement,\nremains true if we change Ebc, A, and B slightly.\nNext, pick an element \u03bb1 in the non-empty set \u03a3\u02dc. Upon transforming the\nmatrix A + \u03bb1B into Jordan normal form, it is easy to see that there are\nmatrices C0 and C1 of arbitrarily small norm so that the eigenvalues \u03bdj of\nA+ \u03bb1B + C0 + (\u03bb\u2212 \u03bb1)C1 (4.4)\nsatisfy\nRe \u03bd1\u2265 . . .\u2265Re \u03bdN\u22121>Re \u03bdN =Re \u03bdN+1>Re \u03bdN+2\u2265 . . .\u2265Re \u03bd2N , (4.5)\nIm \u03bdN 6=Im \u03bdN+1\nat \u03bb = \u03bb1 and\nd Im(\u03bdN \u2212 \u03bdN+1)\nd\u03bb\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\n\u03bb=\u03bb1\n6= 0. (4.6)\nIn particular, we may choose C0 and C1 so small that the statements in the\nprevious paragraph are also true for (4.4). On the other hand, (4.5) and (4.6)\nshow that [13, Hypothesis 8] is satisfied near \u03bb = \u03bb1, and [13, Theorem 5]\nnow implies that the number of eigenvalues of L, posed on (\u2212`, `) with the\nboundary conditions (1.3), in a small disk centered at \u03bb1 becomes unbounded\nas `\u2192\u221e. This contradicts the statement established before that this number\nis equal to M which is independent of `. The second statement of the lemma\nfollows from Remark 4.1.\n4.2.3 Generic singularities\nThe generalized absolute spectrum \u03a3\u2217abs does typically not have any singu-\nlarities except that curves may begin or end at double roots: For a double\nroot at the origin, we have \u03bb = \u03b1\u03bd2 which gives \u03bd1 = \u2212\u03bd2 = \u00b1i\u03b3\/2 for\n\u03b3 \u2265 0 along the curve \u03bb = \u2212\u03b32\u03b1\/4 of generalized absolute spectrum. How-\never, even though we may continue curves smoothly in \u03a3\u2217abs, the Morse index\nm may jump along these curves. This occurs typically at triple points where\nRe \u03bdj+1 = Re \u03bdj+2 = Re \u03bdj+3 and Im \u03bdj+1 > Im \u03bdj+2 > Im \u03bdj+3. Triple points\nshould form a discrete subset of the generalized absolute spectrum. Typically,\n\u03bb = \u03bbtriple + bl(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdl) + O(|\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdl|2) for l = j, j + 1, j + 2 near these singu-\nlarities, and the resulting bifurcation picture is readily computed under the\nassumption that the coefficients bl are different from each other (see Figure 1).\nThe Morse index drops from j+1 to j along two of the curves as they cross the\nsingularity. Between these two curves, there is a curve of generalized absolute\n27\nj+1\nj\nj\nj\nj+1\nj+1\nFig. 1. A triple-point singularity of the generalized absolute spectrum in the complex\n\u03bb-plane. The curves are oriented by increasing \u03b3, the numbers along the curves\nindicate the Morse index, and the insets show the relevant spatial eigenvalues in the\ncomplex plane where we plot Re(\u03bd(\u03bbtriple)) + iR as a dashed line.\nspectrum which also crosses the singularity and along which the Morse index\nincreases. The Morse index increase occurs along the curve where Re \u03bd1 =\nRe \u03bd3, i.e. where the difference of imaginary parts is given by the sum of the\ntwo other differences of imaginary parts.\nNote that if we insist on following curves with constant Morse index (rather\nthan preserving smoothness during the continuation), then we lose a curve\nwith Morse index j + 1 and create a curve with Morse index j. Furthermore,\nif we follow curves with Morse index j, the parameter \u03b3 jumps to a lower\nvalue as we cross the singularity: In particular, we cannot enforce by local\nconsiderations only that curves of constant Morse index continue to \u03b3 = \u221e,\nalthough we may well be able to continue them in \u03bb. We emphasize that the\nabsolute spectrum is nevertheless connected in C, see Lemma 4.8.\nThe singularity d\u03bd1\/d\u03bb = d\u03bd2\/d\u03bb at \u03bd\n\u2217\nj with j = 1, 2 in the generalized ab-\nsolute spectrum typically requires an additional systems parameter, but can\nbe observed for real \u03bb without external parameter. To leading order, we find\nfrom the dispersion relation that \u03bdj = \u03bd\n\u2217\nj +a\u03bb+ bj\u03bb\n2 for j = 1, 2 and therefore\nRe(\u03bd1 \u2212 \u03bd2) = Re[(b1 \u2212 b2)\u03bb2] = 0.\nThe solutions of Re[(b1\u2212 b2)\u03bb2] = 0 form a cross (in x-shape if b1\u2212 b2 is real),\nand \u03b3 increases towards the singularity on one of the curves and decreases\nalong the other curve towards the singularity. The Morse indices are the same\non all four curves. This singularity occurs, for instance, on a real bounded\ninterval of \u03a3\u2217abs \u2229 R whose endpoints are double roots.\nSimilarly, we can encounter two disjoint pairs of spatial eigenvalues with the\nsame real part, in a robust fashion for real \u03bb = \u03bb\u2217, or with an additional\nparameter for \u03bb complex. We expect 6 =\n(\n4\n2\n)\nsmooth curves of generalized\n28\nabsolute spectrum to intersect at such a value of \u03bb. If \u03bb is real, then two of\nthese curves coincide and lie on the real axis due to the additional symmetry\nof spatial eigenvalues with respect to complex conjugation.\n4.2.4 The algorithm in practice\nComputationally, it is more reliable and convenient to replace the dispersion\nrelation d(\u03bb, \u03bd) by the original algebraic equation. Using the definition\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd) := D\u03bd2 + c\u03bd + a0 \u2212 \u03bb, (4.7)\nthe system A(\u03bb, \u03bd; \u03b3) = 0 is equivalent to solving\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd)u = 0, [D(2\u03bd + i\u03b3) + c](u+ i\u03b3v) +D(\u03bb, \u03bd)v = 0, (4.8)\ntogether with the normalization\n\u3008uold, u\u3009 = 1, \u3008vold, u\u3009 \u2212 \u3008uold, v\u3009 \u2212 i\u03b3\u3008vold, v\u3009 = 0 (4.9)\nfor (\u03bb, \u03bd, \u03b3, u, v), where (uold, vold) are the solutions taken at a previous con-\ntinuation step.\nProof. For \u03b3 6= 0, we start with (4.1) and see that it is equivalent to the\nsystem\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd)u=0, \u3008u, u\u3009 = 1\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd + i\u03b3)w=0, \u3008w,w\u3009 = 1\nwith the additional unknowns (u,w). If we assume that uold and wold are\nsolutions to this system, or close to solutions, then we may replace the above\nsystem by\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd)u=0, \u3008uold, u\u3009 = 1\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd + i\u03b3)w=0, \u3008wold, w\u3009 = 1.\nWe write w in the form w = u+ i\u03b3v so that the second equation becomes\n0 = D(\u03bb, \u03bd + i\u03b3)(u+ i\u03b3v) = [D(\u03bb, \u03bd)\u2212D(\u03bb, \u03bd + i\u03b3)]u+D(\u03bb, \u03bd + i\u03b3)i\u03b3v\nwhere we used the equation for u. Dividing by i\u03b3 and using (4.7), we get\n[D(2\u03bd + i\u03b3) + c]u+D(\u03bb, \u03bd + i\u03b3)v = 0.\n29\nThe normalization condition \u3008wold, w\u3009 = 1 for w becomes\n1 = \u3008uold + i\u03b3vold, u+ i\u03b3v\u3009 = 1 + i\u03b3\u3008uold, v\u3009+ i\u03b3\u3008vold, u+ i\u03b3v\u3009\nand therefore\n\u3008uold, v\u3009+ \u3008vold, u+ i\u03b3v\u3009 = 0.\nThe computations for \u03b3 = 0 are similar and we therefore omit them.\n4.3 Periodic coefficients\nThe initial setup for periodic coefficients is similar. The dispersion relation is\nnow given by\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = det[\u03a6\u03bb \u2212 e\u03bdL],\nand we shall use the regularized system\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd)u = 0, [D(2(\u2202x + \u03bd) + i\u03b3) + c](u+ i\u03b3v) +D(\u03bb, \u03bd)v = 0, (4.10)\nwhere\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd) = D(\u2202x + \u03bd)2 + c(\u2202x + \u03bd) + a(x)\u2212 \u03bb, (4.11)\ntogether with the normalization conditions\nL\u222b\n0\n\u3008uold, u\u3009 dx=1 (4.12)\nL\u222b\n0\n[\u3008vold, u\u3009 \u2212 \u3008uold, v\u3009 \u2212 i\u03b3\u3008vold, v\u3009] dx=0\nfor u and v. It suffices here to consider \u03b3 \u2208 [0, pi\/L).\nRegarding instability of the absolute spectrum, we can conclude that the ex-\nistence of an unstable isola of essential spectrum implies unstable absolute\nspectrum provided it lies on the boundary of the component of the resolvent\nset where the Morse index of the period map \u03a6\u03bb is N . This observation is a\nconsequence of the more general fact that isolas of essential spectrum contain\n30\nabsolute spectrum of a certain Morse index (see [9, Theorem 3.3] and [10] for\ndetails).\nContinuing a curve of generalized absolute spectrum starting at double roots\nproceeds as for constant coefficients. However, neither the generalized absolute\nspectrum nor the absolute spectrum of a given index are, in general, connected,\nand the initial computation of double roots becomes therefore more important.\nFor periodic coefficients, there exist infinitely many double roots for \u03b3 = 0\neven though each bounded region of the complex plane typically contains only\nfinitely many. In addition, it is more complicated to find double roots in the\nfirst place: in fact, we do not know of any systematic way of locating double\nroots in a given region of the complex plane.\nInstead of starting continuation at a double root, one may, of course, start at\nany given element of the (generalized) absolute spectrum, and we therefore\ndiscuss now possible strategies for locating elements of the (generalized) ab-\nsolute spectrum. These strategies involve continuing solutions of (3.8), where\n\u03bd = \u03b7 + i\u03b3, in either (\u03b3, \u03bb, L) or (\u03b7, \u03bb, L) or (\u03bd,Re\u03bb, L). Continuation in\n(\u03b3, \u03bb, L) for fixed and possibly non-zero \u03b7 corresponds to computing the es-\nsential spectrum of L in an exponentially weighted space with exponential\nrate \u03b7.\nFirstly, consider an intersection point of two curve segments of essential spec-\ntrum, possibly for \u03b7 6= 0. Unless this point is a root of \u2202\u03bbd(\u03bb, \u03bd), it lies in\nthe generalized absolute spectrum, because two Floquet exponents have the\nsame real part, and it can be used as a starting point for continuation. In fact,\na Jordan curve of essential spectrum that does not contain further essential\nspectrum continues in \u03b7 either to a self intersecting curve or to a double root\n[10].\nSecondly, we discuss the case when (generalized) absolute spectrum intersects\nthe real axis. If \u03bb lies in the generalized absolute spectrum, then the two\nassociated Floquet multipliers have the same modulus. If \u03bb is, in fact, real,\nthen the two Floquet multipliers are either non-real complex conjugates, or\nthey form a double root, or they are real and of opposite sign:\nIf the Floquet multipliers are non-real, simple and complex conjugates, then\nso are the associated Floquet exponents \u03bd. A small change in the real part of\n\u03bb or in \u03b7 = Re \u03bd does not change the property that the exponents are complex\nconjugates and, consequently, the generalized absolute spectrum intersects the\nreal axis in an interval with open interior. The end points of these intervals are\ndouble roots. Thus, continuation of \u03bd = \u03b7 + i\u03b3 in \u03bb \u2208 R may lead to double\nroots in the generalized absolute spectrum. By symmetry of Floquet expo-\nnents, the computation of real intervals using (3.8) requires the continuation\nof only one Floquet exponent.\n31\nIf there are two real simple Floquet multipliers of opposite sign for real \u03bb, then\nthese multipliers will stay real if \u03bb is varied on the real axis. Thus, on account\nof the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations, changing the imaginary part of \u03bb will,\nto leading order, only change the imaginary part of the Floquet multipliers,\nwhich shows that the corresponding curve of generalized absolute spectrum\nintersects the real axis transversely with a vertical tangent. Hence, continuing\nfor real \u03bb a pair of Floquet multipliers with opposite sign in \u03bd may lead to the\nlocation of such a crossing point.\nOther typical singularities of the absolute spectrum on the real axis are as\ndescribed in \u00a74.2.3.\nWe refer to \u00a75 (see also [9, Chapter 4.4] and [10]) for examples where we use\nexponential weights to locate absolute spectrum.\n4.4 Continuation, and implementation in AUTO\nIn the case of constant coefficients, we first calculate all double roots (\u03bb, \u03bd),\ni.e. all roots of A(\u03bb, \u03bd; 0) = 0, and subsequently nontrivial solutions u and v\nof the linear equation (4.8). Starting from each of these at most N(2N \u2212 1)\npoints, we then continue solutions of (4.8)-(4.9) in \u03b3.\nAfterward, we reconstruct the Morse indices on all curve segments of \u03a3\u2217abs\nbetween triple points and double roots by computing all 2N solutions of\nA(\u03bb, \u03bd; \u03b3) = 0 at all double roots and triple points (or at arbitrary test points\non each segment). Alternatively, we could compute all 2N solutions \u03bdj of\nD(\u03bb, \u03bdj)uj = 0 and (4.8)-(4.9) simultaneously, though this is computationally\nmuch more expensive.\nWe remark that it is not necessary to use the regularized system (4.8)-(4.9)\naway from double roots. Instead, it may be convenient for the implementation\nto use D(\u03bb, \u03bd)u1 = 0 and D(\u03bb, \u03bd + i\u03b3)u2 = 0.\nExcept for the location of double roots, these remarks apply equally to periodic\ncoefficients and (4.10)-(4.12). For the sake of consistency with this case, we de-\nscribe the setup in auto for (4.8)-(4.9) as a first-order system and boundary-\nvalue problem, so there are 2N + 2N complex equations. This way the same\nequation file of auto can be used.\nThe constants file:We cast both (4.8) and (4.10) as ndim=8N real ODEs with\nbcnd=8N periodic boundary conditions and icnd=4 real integral conditions for\nnormalization. The nicp=5 free parameters are \u03bb, \u03bd \u2208 C and \u03b3 \u2208 R. It is\nuseful for subsequent computations to view \u03b3 = Im \u03bd2 and include Re \u03bd2 in the\nimplementation.\n32\nFor the case of constant coefficients, eigenfunctions are spatially constant, so\nwe set ntst=1 and ncol=2. It is useful to disable mesh adaption by setting\niad=0 and to exclude the vector v in (4.8)-(4.9) from the pseudo-arclength\ncomputation by nthu=4 followed by 2N lines of the form \u201c<component index>\n0\u201d.\nThe equations file: It is often useful to implement the operator D(\u03bb, \u03bd)\nin a new subroutine that is called from the subroutine func, since (4.8) and\n(4.10) require two evaluations of D. This makes it also easy to simultaneously\ncontinue all eigenvalues and thereby the Morse index, if feasible. The cur-\nrent Morse index can then be stored in an additional parameter. Boundary\nand integral conditions are implemented in the subroutine bncd and icnd as\ndescribed previously in \u00a73.5.\nInitial data: For constant coefficients, we use double roots as described above\nand set the data in the subroutine stpnt. For periodic coefficients, initial\npoints in the generalized absolute spectrum are often found by continuing sin-\ngle Floquet exponents in exponential weights to a point where two of these\nhave the same real part. To improve convergence of the initialization, we rec-\nommend to join both eigenfunctions and the nonlinear solution into a single\ndata file and rescale to the same discretization grid. The program @fc converts\nsuch a file to auto format and reads initial parameters from the subroutine\nstpnt, see [4].\n5 Examples\nTo illustrate the algorithms outlined above, we investigate essential and ab-\nsolute spectra for the FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo and the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau\nequation 1 .\n5.1 The FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo equation\nOur first example is concerned with the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo equation\nut=uxx + cux \u2212 v \u2212 u(u\u2212 1)(u\u2212 a)\nvt= \u03b4vxx + cvx + \u000f(u\u2212 \u03b3v),\n1 The auto files used for the following computations are available from the authors\nupon request.\n33\n0.0020 0.0025 0.0030 0.0035\n0.175\n0.275\n0.375\n0. 100 200.\n0.\n1.\nc\n\u03b5\nslow\nfast\nu\nx\n(a)\n0.00330 0.00340 0.00350 0.00360 0.00370 0.00380\n-0.010\n0.000\n0.030\n0.070\n\u03b5\n(b)\nRe(  )\u03bb\nslow\nfast\nFig. 2.

Here, we already passed\nto a frame moving with speed c. Our goal is to investigate the critical part of\nthe spectrum of wave trains (u, v)(x) = (u, v)(x+ 2pi\/k).\nIt is known, from numerical computations and through theoretical work, that\nthe FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo equation supports, in an appropriate parameter regime,\na fast stable pulse and an unstable slow pulse which disappear in fold or\nsaddle-node bifurcations as the parameter \u000f is increased. Both pulses are ac-\ncompanied by wave trains with arbitrarily large spatial period, which converge\nto the pulses as the period is increased and also undergo saddle-node bifurca-\ntions for each fixed period as \u000f is increased. Our objective is to numerically\ncontinue the spectrum of these wave trains, which will cross the imaginary\naxis as we continue the wave trains for a fixed large period through their fold\nbifurcation. For large periods, the eigenvalues of the pulses generate nearby\nisolas of essential spectrum [5] and so we expect an isola to cross at the fold\npoint. Throughout, we fix the parameters a = \u03b3 = 0.2 and \u03b4 = 0.25, and con-\nsider the wave trains with spatial period L = 200. The bifurcation diagram in\n(c, \u000f) and the associated solution profiles are shown in Figure 2(a).\nFirst, to illustrate the PDE spectra near the fold bifurcation, we continue the\nfast wave trains in the (\u000f, c)-plane until they become the slow wave trains\nwhile, at the same time, computing and continuing the simple real eigenvalue\nof their PDE linearization L0 that destabilizes the wave train at the fold. The\nresulting eigenvalue curve is shown in Figure 2(b).\nNext, we compute the isolas of essential spectrum that emanate from the fold\neigenvalue and from the translation eigenvalue at \u03bb = 0 for different values of \u000f\nnear the fold bifurcation. As illustrated in Figure 3, the fast wave train desta-\nbilizes already before the actually fold bifurcation as the two aforementioned\nisolas first coalesce at the temporal eigenvalues corresponding to \u03bd = ipi\/L to\n34\n-0.00100 -0.00080 -0.00060 -0.00040 -0.00020 0.00000\n-0.00030\n0.00000\n0.00030\nRe(  )\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nIm(  )\n(a)\n-0.00020 -0.00010 0.00000 0.00010\n-0.00040\n0.00000\n0.00040\n\u03bb\nIm(  )\u03bb\nRe(  )\n(b)\nFig. 3.

Instead, we located it indirectly via isolas\nof essential spectrum, computed in exponentially weighted spaces, which nec-\nessarily contain absolute spectrum of index 2 on account of the discussion in\n\u00a74.3. Figure 5 shows these isolas inside the isola plotted in Figure 3(b). The\nisola containing absolute spectrum moves into the unstable half plane as the\nparameter \u000f approaches the fold point (see Figure 5(b)). Thus, the wave train\nis not only essentially but also absolutely unstable before the fold point.\nLastly, on the branch corresponding to the slow wave train, the merged isolas\nseparate again into an unstable isola which is completely contained in the\nright half-plane and an isola which emerges from \u03bb = 0, which is contained\nin the closed right half-plane (see Figure 6). Again by \u00a74.3, both of these\nisola contain absolute spectrum. Concerning the isola attached to the origin,\nwe located a point in the absolute spectrum by continuation of two Floquet\nexponents whose imaginary parts differ by pi\/L and hence have opposite signs\nas Floquet multipliers, see Figure 7. The expected curve of absolute spectrum\ncontaining this point seems hard to compute. However, since the signs of the\nreal Floquet multipliers e\u03bd2 and e\u03bd3 are opposite, the crossing point of the\nreal parts of the Floquet exponents is not a double root and the attached\ncurve of absolute spectrum should cross the real axis with orthogonal tangent.\nWe bound the location of this curve of absolute spectrum by continuing the\nisola of essential spectrum in Figure 6(b) in decreasing exponential weight\n\u03b7 = Re \u03bd \u2264 0. These isolas in weighted spaces appear to be concentric circles\nabout the crossing point, and the component of absolute spectrum lies inside\nthe smallest isola we computed, a circle of radius 5\u00d7 10\u221213.\n36\n0.0 0.0000001 0.0000002 0.0000003\n-0.70\n0.0\n0.10\n2 2+1\n(b)\n\u22121 +1\n\u22121Re(  )\u03bd\nRe(  )\u03bb\u03bd3\n\u03bd\u03bd\n\u03bd3\n(a)\n -5e-13\n 0\n 5e-13\n 1.44657e-07\n 1.44658e-07(b)\n+1\n\u22121\nRe(  )\u03bb\nIm(  )\u03bb\nFig. 7.

Signs of real Floquet multipliers are indicated.\nThis isola contains the component of the absolute spectrum referred to in (a).\n5.2 The complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation\nOur second example exemplifies how the methods can be adapted outside\nof the class of reaction-diffusion systems, allowing for a complex diffusion\ncoefficient with positive real part. We consider wave trains of the complex\nGinzburg\u2013Landau equation (CGL)\nAt = (1 + i\u03b1)Axx + A\u2212 (1 + i\u03b2)A|A|2, (5.1)\nwhich is an approximate modulation equation valid near the onset of certain\ninstabilities of the essential spectrum; see the review [8] and references therein.\nPeriodic wave-train solutions of (5.1) are given by A\u2217 = rei(\u03bax\u2212\u03c9t) with r2 =\n1\u2212\u03ba2 and \u03c9 = \u03b2+(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)\u03ba2. In the detuned variable A = A\u02dce\u2212i\u03c9t, the equation\nbecomes, upon omitting tildes,\nAt = (1 + i\u03b1)Axx + (1 + i\u03c9)A\u2212 (1 + i\u03b2)|A|2A\nwith solutions A\u2217 = rei\u03bax. For the linearization about these wave trains, we\nconsider B and B as independent variables, not necessarily complex conjugate,\nand obtain the linearization\n\u03bbB=(1 + i\u03b1)Bxx + (1 + i\u03c9)B \u2212 (1 + i\u03b2)(2|A\u2217|2B + A2\u2217B)\n\u03bbB=(1\u2212 i\u03b1)Bxx + (1 + i\u03c9)B \u2212 (1\u2212 i\u03b2)(2|A\u2217|2B + A2\u2217B).\nNext, we substitute B = bei\u03bax+\u03bdx and B = be\u2212i\u03bax+\u03bdx, where we view b and b\nas independent variables. We obtain the analogue to the matrix in (4.11) for\n37\nthe dispersion relation\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd) =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed (1 + i\u03b1)(\u03bd + i\u03ba)2 0\n0 (1\u2212 i\u03b1)(\u03bd \u2212 i\u03ba)2\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8+ a\u2212 \u03bb id\nwhere\na =\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed 1 + i\u03c9 \u2212 2(1 + i\u03b2)r2 \u2212(1 + i\u03b2)r2\n\u2212(1\u2212 i\u03b2)r2 1\u2212 i\u03c9 \u2212 2(1\u2212 i\u03b2)r2\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8\nwhich simplifies to\nD(\u03bb, \u03bd) = \u2212\u03bb id+\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ed (1 + i\u03b1)(\u03bd2 + 2i\u03ba\u03bd)\u2212 (1 + i\u03b2)r2 \u2212(1 + i\u03b2)r2\n\u2212(1 + i\u03b2)r2 (1\u2212 i\u03b1)(\u03bd2 \u2212 2i\u03ba\u03bd)\u2212 (1\u2212 i\u03b2)r2\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f8 .\nHence, we obtain a constant-coefficient problem with the dispersion relation\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = detD(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0, and the approach of \u00a73.3 and \u00a74.2 for N = 2 applies.\nThe essential spectrum {\u03bb; d(\u03bb, i\u03b3) = 0, \u03b3 \u2208 R} consists of the two explicit\ncurves\n\u03bb\u00b1(i\u03b3) = \u03ba2 \u2212 1\u2212 \u03b3(2i\u03b1\u03ba+ \u03b3) (5.2)\n\u00b1\n\u221a\n(\u03ba2 \u2212 1)2\u2212\u03b3(4i\u03b2\u03ba3 + 2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 + \u03b12\u03b33 \u2212 4i\u03ba(\u03b2 + \u03b1\u03b32)\u22122\u03ba2(2 + \u03b1\u03b2)\u03b3).\nWe note that \u03bb\u2212(0) = 0, so zero is always in the essential spectrum (see\nFigure 9(a) for the shape of the essential spectrum).\nRegarding the absolute spectrum, note that the dispersion relation d has four\nspatial roots \u03bd for each \u03bb, and the Morse index for the absolute spectrum is\ntherefore two. Furthermore, we expect\n(\n4\n2\n)\n= 6 double roots by Lemma 4.5;\nnote, however, that this prediction will not hold for \u03b1 = 0 since the diffusion\ncoefficients coincide in this case, and Lemma 4.5 does not apply. Indeed, the\nresultant of d(\u03bb, \u03bd) and \u2202\u03bdd(\u03bb, \u03bd) with respect to \u03bd has degree four in that\ncase, hence there are only four double roots (plus two at infinity). We now\ndiscuss the set \u03a3\u2217abs for various different parameter values.\nWe focus on the complex Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation with \u03b1 6= 0 for which\nessential and absolute spectrum generally differ. Furthermore, the explicit so-\nlution (5.2) is not easy to interpret for general \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03ba. Therefore, it appears\n38\n-10. -5. 0. 5. 10. 15. 20. 25.\n-7.5\n-5.0\n-2.5\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\n(a)\n2 1 1\n3\n2\n2\n1\n3\nRe(  )\u03bb\nIm(  )\u03bb\n-2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0\n-1.00\n-0.50\n0.0\n0.50\n1.00\n(b)\n1\n2 3\n2\n3\n2\n2\n1\nIm(  )\n3\n2\n\u03bb\nRe(  )\u03bb\nFig. 8. The generalized absolute spectrum \u03a3\u2217abs is plotted for (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0.1, 0.2),\nwhere bullets correspond to branch points and numbers indicate the Morse index.\n(a) For the wave number \u03ba = 0.1 the absolute spectrum, \u03a32abs, is stable, and its\nrightmost point is a branch point at \u03bb \u2248 \u22120.0001. (b) For the wave number \u03ba = 0.7\nthe absolute spectrum is unstable, and its rightmost points are branch points at\n\u03bb \u2248 0.115\u00b1 0.036i (here we omitted two branch points of index one at \u03bb \u2248 189 and\n\u03bb \u2248 210).\nappropriate to use the numerical approaches discussed in \u00a74.2 to compute the\nabsolute spectrum.\nOur results are summarized in Figures 8 and 10, where we plot the numerically\ncomputed sets \u03a3\u2217abs and the indices associated with each segment for three sets\nof parameter values. The union of the segments with index 2 is the absolute\nspectrum. Of interest is the onset of absolute instability, which we computed\nfor fixed values of (\u03b1, \u03b2) as the wave number \u03ba is varied. For (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0.1, 0.2),\nthe absolute spectrum becomes unstable through a complex conjugate pair of\nbranch points that crosses the imaginary axis, while for (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (\u22128, 1) all\nbranch points lie to the left of the imaginary axis, and the instability is induced\nby a pair of complex conjugate curves of absolute spectrum that crosses the\nimaginary axis.\nFirst, consider (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0.1, 0.2). Starting with the stable absolute spectrum\nfor \u03ba = 0.1 shown in Figure 8(a), we continued the branch points in the\nparameter \u03ba \u2208 [0, 1] to locate the onset of absolute instability (see Figure 9(b)).\nThe real stable branch point in the absolute spectrum for \u03ba = 0.1 shown in\nFigure 8(a) merges with a branch point of index 3 at \u03ba \u2248 0.51 and Re\u03bb \u2248\n\u22120.01. For increasing \u03ba a pair of complex conjugate branch points emerges,\neach with index 2, and crosses the imaginary axis at \u03ba \u2248 0.598. This is the\nonly crossing of branch points in the absolute spectrum for (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (0.1, 0.2)\nand \u03ba \u2208 [0, 1].\nNext, we consider the Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation for (\u03b1, \u03b2) = (\u22128, 1), which\nlie in the Benjamin\u2013Feir unstable regime \u03b1\u03b2 < 1, and focus on the wave train\nwith wave number \u03ba = \u22120.3. The generalized absolute spectrum is plotted in\nFigure 10. In this case, the absolute spectrum is unstable but does not contain\nany branch points. In particular, the instability is a remnant instability (in\n39\n-10. -8. -6. -4. -2. 0.\n-1.00\n-0.50\n0.00\n0.50\n1.00\nRe(  )\u03bb\nIm(  )\u03bb\n(a)\n0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60 0.80 1.00\n-0.25\n0.00\n0.50\n1.00\n3 3\n2\n3\n2\nRe(  )\u03bb\n\u03ba\n2\n(b)\nFig. 9.
