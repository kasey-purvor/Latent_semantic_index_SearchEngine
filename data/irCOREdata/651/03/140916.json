Introduction \nLaminated composites are increasingly used in primary aircraft structures, such as the wing \nand tailplane spars and ribs as they offer higher stiffness and strength to weight ratio \ncompared to their metallic counterparts. These composite panels often require cutouts for \naccess, inspection, electric and fuel lines, and also for reducing the structural weight. Cutouts \nlead to stress concentration and reduced buckling load capability. Therefore, the effects of \ncutouts on laminated composite panels have been investigated by many researchers over the \nlast forty years. \nThe initial studies were mostly focused on the buckling and postbuckling behaviour of \ncomposite plates with cutouts. Nemeth published a review in 1996 on the research activities \nconducted between 1972 and 1993 on the buckling and\/or postbuckling behaviour of \ncomposite plates with a cutout [1]. The review has covered many influential factors, such as \nthe cutout size, shape, position and orientation, plate aspect and slenderness ratios, loading \nand boundary conditions; plate orthotropy and anisotropy were also considered. A further \nstudy on the postbuckling behaviour was conducted by Bailey and Wood [2], which studied a \nsquare panel with circular and square cutouts and focused on the effect of the cutout diameter \nto panel length ratio (up to 0.65) on the buckling load carrying capability.  \nStress concentration arising from the cutouts has also been a major concern. Rezaeepazhand \nand Jafari [3] studied the effect of cutout geometry, material properties and fibre angles on the \nstress distribution around a centrally located cutout in composite plates. Whitworth and \nMahase [4] calculated the failure stress and stress concentration around a circular cutout using \nthe Lekhnitskii anisotropy elasticity. Ply-by-ply failure stresses were calculated for three \nlaminates and results showed that higher failure stress and maximum stress concentration \noccurred at the 0 degree ply. Stress concentration factors (SCFs) for isotropic and orthotropic \nplates with a circular cutout under uniaxial and biaxial tension were determined by Wu and \nMu [5]; they showed that the SCFs depend only on the cutout diameter to plate width ratio. \nHenshaw et al. [6] calculated the stress concentration in a laminate composite panel with \nmultiple cutouts. They found that stress concentration around the original cutout was \nsignificantly increased when a second and third cutout were introduced; the location of \nadditional cutouts also had a great influence on the degree of stress concentration.  \nOne way of reducing stress concentration without adding structural weight is to find the \noptimum cutout shape. Falzon et al. [7] used the Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (ESO) \nmethod to optimise cutout shapes in a square composite panel under different types of \nloading. They found that under shear load, the optimum cutout shape for a quasi-isotropic \nlaminate was a rectangle of aspect ratio 1.86 and orientated 45\u00b0 to the horizontal axis. For an \nisotropic panel the optimum cutout shape was a diamond.  \nWhen significant reduction of stress concentration or increment of buckling strength is \nrequired, cutout reinforcements are often used. Guo [8] has investigated the effectiveness of \ndifferent types of reinforcements around a circular cutout in terms of the stress concentration \n 3 \nreduction and improvement of critical buckling load of a composite shear panel. The study \nhas shown that the most significant reduction in stress concentration and the best \nimprovement in buckling stability can be obtained by a pair of rings (doublers) attached to \neach side of the cutout. Eiblmeier and Loughlan [9-10] studied the buckling response of a \nlaminate panel with a circular cutout reinforced by doublers under different loading and \nboundary conditions. This investigation showed that buckling stability was increased most \nefficiently with rings up to 15mm wide.  \nAnother approach to increase cutout load capability is to apply the fibre tow steering \ntechnique. Jegley et al. [11-12] demonstrated the effectiveness of tow steered panels to reduce \nthe stress concentration around a cutout and improve the overall panel load carrying \ncapability under both compression and shear loading. Lopes et al. [13] conducted a study on \nthe progressive damage behaviour in postbuckling and final structural failure regime of tow-\nplaced composite panels with a central cutout. Panels with fibre tow placement showed up to \n56% higher strength than prepreg laminates. Damage initiation and structural final failure \nwere also significantly delayed for panels fabricated by the fibre tow placement technique.   \nThese extensive research activities were, however, all conducted on flat panels and till today \nfew studies have been published on realistic composite beam structures. The effect of cutout \nshape and the effectiveness of different types of cutout reinforcement in a composite beam are \nyet to be investigated.  \nThis paper reports a recent investigation into the design of cutout shape and reinforcement for \na composite C-section beam subjected to shear load. The objective is to reduce the cutout \nstress concentration by bonding various edge reinforcements that are made of different \nmaterials. The effectiveness of conventional metal reinforcement rings was compared to \ncomposite rings made of either prepreg laminate or fibre tows. Finite element analysis and \nexperimental tests were conducted and good agreement has been achieved for different cutout \nshapes and reinforcements. The novel fibre tow reinforcement shows clear advantage over the \nconventional rings.  \n2. The C-section beams \nConstant C-section composite beams were designed for FE analysis and experimental tests. \nEach beam is of 650 mm in length and 200 mm in web depth and 100 mm flange width. Some \nbeams have a single cutout of either circular or diamond shape, and others have double \ncutouts of one circular and one diamond. Figures 1a and b show the dimensions of the single \nand double cutout beams. Some cutouts were reinforced around the perimeter by means of \nrings (doublers) made of either a steel alloy or carbon composite laminate, or the fibre tow \nplacement technique. The geometry of the rings is given in Fig. 1c. The steel rings are 1.5 mm \nthick and 20 mm wide, the laminate rings are 2 mm thick and 20 mm wide made of 8-ply \nquasi-isotropic (QI) carbon-epoxy prepreg, and the fibre tow rings are 6-ply carbon fibres of \ntotal thickness of 1.5 mm. Strain gauge positions are illustrated in Fig. 1d and e. Strains were \n 4 \nmeasured at positions marked A, A\u2019 and B by mounting strain gauge rosettes each consisting \nof three gauges in the x, y and 45o directions. For shear loaded panels, stress concentration \noccurs near point A.    \n2.1 Manufacturing \nTo validate the numerical analysis, four beam specimens with different cutout and \nreinforcement designs were made and tested. These test samples were manufactured by \nCranfield University\u2019s Department of Materials. The beams were laminated by hand using \nHexply UDM21\/35%\/268\/T800S prepreg. To form the \u2018C\u2019 beam sections using an aluminium \nmale tool, each set of four plies was debulked using a vacuum bag so as to minimise corner \nfibre wrinkling. The beams were consolidated and cured in an autoclave at 6 bar and up to \n180oC for a total cure time of 7 hours. An Airtech Airpad rubber intensifier was used as a \nfemale tool under the vacuum bag to provide a smooth outer surface. The cutouts in the beam \nwere made using a GFM water jet cutting machine.  \nThe three types of reinforcing rings were produced using two techniques. For the steel and \ncomposite laminate, water jet cutting of plate was used. For the fibre tow reinforced ring, a \nnet shape ring was manufactured using a single prepreg tow. This was wound around a \nmandrel of an outer diameter matching the hole diameter, constrained perpendicular to the \nmandrel using side plates, then autoclave cured by the same process as for the laminate. The \nreinforcing rings were bonded at 50oC for four hours using the Huntsman Araldite 420 A\/B \ntwo component epoxy paste adhesive.  \n2.2Materials  \nAll test samples were made of the Hexply M21\/T800S carbon-epoxy prepreg that came in a \nroll of 300 mm wide and ply thickness of 0.25 mm. Samples were fabricated in symmetric \nlayup [\u00b145\/0\/\u00b145\/90\/\u00b145]s to a final thickness of 4 mm (16 plies) for the beam web and \nflanges. The mechanical properties of the laminate are given in Table 1.    \n2.3 Cases studied in this work \nTable 2 summarises all the study cases with details being described below. All design cases \nhave been modelled by the FEM and some of them are validated by experimental tests. Each \ncantilever beam was subjected to a 20 kN vertical load applied at the its free end and near its \nshear centre, which is equivalent to a nominal applied shear stress of 23 MPa (average) or 28 \nMPa (maximum).   \nExample 1 \u2013 single cutout.  \nEach beam sample contains a cutout of either circular or diamond shape and is clamped at one \nend and subjected to a vertical load at the other end through the beam section shear centre. \nFour different scenarios have been studied to include two cutout shapes and two types of edge \nreinforcement which are: 1.1) un-reinforced diamond cutout; 1.2) un-reinforced circular \n 5 \ncutout; 1.3) circular cutout reinforced by a pair of composite laminate rings made of the same \nmaterial as the beam and bonded to both sides of the cutout; 1.4) circular cutout reinforced by \na pair of carbon fibre tow rings bonded to both sides of the cutout. \nExample 2 \u2013 double cutouts with the circular cutout near the clamping end.  \nBeam sample is clamped at the end near the circular cutout and subjected to a vertical load at \nthe other end through the beam section shear centre. Cutout that is nearer to the clamp end is \nsubjected to severer loads, hence attention is focused on the strains and stresses around the \ncircular cutout. Three cases have been studied: 2.1) un-reinforced cutouts; 2.2) both cutouts \nwere reinforced by a pair of laminate rings bonded to both sides of the cutout; 2.3) reinforced \ncircular cutout by a pair of steel rings bonded to both sides of the cutout.  \nExample 3 \u2013 double cutouts with the diamond cutout near the clamping end.  \nUsing the same beam as the example 2 but switching the support ends, attention is now \nfocused on the stresses and strains around the diamond cutout and the interaction effect. Three \ncases have been studied: 3.1) un-reinforced cutouts; 3.2) reinforced by a pair of laminate rings \nbonded to both sides of the cutouts; 3.3) reinforced cutouts by a pair of steel rings. \n \n3. Numerical modelling \n3.1 Modelling approach \nAll design cases presented above have been modelled by the finite element method to \ndetermine the stress concentration around these cutouts. The commercial FE code MSC \nPATRAN\/NASTRAN was used to create the C-section beam models and to carry out \nnumerical analyses. The flanges and beam web were modelled using quadrilateral linear shell \nelements (QUAD4) and the IsoMesh facility. The QUAD4 elements are capable of modelling \ncomposite properties. The reinforcement rings were also modelled by the shell elements and \nthe offset command was used to separate the surfaces representing the beam web and the ring \nrespectively. Material properties, boundary and loading conditions were implemented in the \nmodel using the appropriate tools offered by PATRAN. A typical FE model has 11461 shell \nelements.   \n3.2 Numerical results \nSingle cutout without reinforcement (cases 1.1 and 1.2) \nComparison is made between the un-reinforced diamond and circular cutouts under the same \nloading (P = 20 kN) and boundary conditions. FE stress contour maps are shown in Fig. 2, \nwhich indicates that the stress concentration around the diamond cutout is less severe than \nthat of the circular cutout. The maximum principal stress (\u03c31) is 155 MPa for the diamond and \n167 MPa for the circular cutout.  \nFE calculated maximum stresses and strains are listed in Table 3. These values are calculated \nat the maximum stress point for the different cutouts. The FE results indicate that the \n 6 \nmaximum stress is at the 130o position for the circular cutout (Fig. 2a) and 100o position for \nthe diamond (Fig. 2b). Table 3 indicates that all the stress and strain components are generally \nlower around the diamond cutout. In terms of the maximum in-plane shear stains (\u03b3xy), the \ndifference between the diamond and the circular is about 16% (1726 vs. 2049 \u00b5\u03b5). In terms of \nthe maximum x-direction stains (\u03b5x), the difference between the diamond and the circular is \nabout 17% (1760 vs. 2130 \u00b5\u03b5). Therefore, the FE results indicate that the diamond cutout can \nreduce the stress concentration by about 16-17%.   \nSingle circular cutout with reinforcement rings (cases 1.3 and 1.4) \nWhen the single circular cutout are reinforced by a pair of composite rings (cases 1.3 and 1.4), \nstress concentration reduction is significant in all stress components. Table 4 shows the \ncalculated average stress and strain components at the measurement point A (Fig. 1c). The \nreduction in the principal stress (\u03c31) is 31% (unreinforced web stress 113 MPa versus the \nreinforced web stress of 78 MPa) when using the laminate reinforcement rings (cases 1.3), \nand stress reduction becomes much higher at 43% (113 MPa vs. 64 MPa) when the fibre tow \nrings are employed (cases 1.4).  \nThese reinforcement rings work like doublers that are designed to pick up loads and relieve \nthe stresses around the cutout on the beam web. Since the strain values are the same on the \nbeam web and the attached rings, the laminate rings that have the same elastic modulus as the \nweb laminate will bear the same average stress as the material around the cutout edge on the \nweb. This is demonstrated by the FE calculated principal stresses in the laminate ring and the \nweb, i.e. \u03c31_ring = 76 MPa and \u03c31_web = 78 MPa from Table 4 case 1.3. The numerical results \nalso show that the fibre tow rings can pick up more stresses from the web, e.g. \u03c31_ring = 129 \nMPa versus \u03c31_web = 64 MPa from Table 4 case 1.4. This difference in stress transfer \ncapability can be explained by the difference in the elastic modulus of the fibre tows and that \nof the quasi-isotropic laminate ring.  \nTo quantify the load transfer capability, stiffness ratio of two different rings is defined as:  \nbb\naa\ntE\ntE\nr\n1\n1\n=\n     (1) \nwhere ta and tb are the thickness, and E1a and E1b the equivalent elastic constant (modulus) of \nthe two different reinforcement rings, respectively. Subscript \u201c1\u201d indicates the modulus in a \nspecific direction. \nAssign E1b as the modulus of the quasi-isotropic laminate ring (case 1.3) that is calculated as \n64.7 GPa by the laminate theory, and E1a as the fibre tow modulus (case 1.4) that has a range \nof values depending on the position of fibre tows winding around the cutout perimeter. Since \nthe strain gauge rosette covers an area of 4 x 4 mm (gauge length), the measurement point \nrepresents an arc length that subtends an angle of 5.7 degree along the circumference. The \nupper bound value of E1a is estimated as 172 GPa when the fibre tow is at the centre of the \n 7 \nmeasurement point A and the fibres are exactly in 45o direction; the lower bound value is \nestimated as 130 GPa when the fibre tow is displaced from the measurement centre by \u00b12.85 \ndegree. The thickness of the fibre tow ring ta is 1.5 mm and the laminate ring tb is 2 mm. \nAccording to eq. (1), the stiffness ratio of the two rings is between 1.52 (lower bound) and \n1.99 (upper bound), resulting in an average stiffness ratio of 1.75, which is very close the ratio \nof the stresses transferred to the two rings that is 1.70 (based on calculated \u03c31_tow_ring = 129 \nMPa & \u03c31_lam_ring = 76 MPa in Table 4). Hence considerably higher load transfer capability is \nachieved by the fibre tow ring owing to its better performance in the fibre direction.        \nFor each case, stresses in each laminate ply in the beam web as well as in the rings were \ncalculated.  An example is presented in Fig 3, which shows the principal stress in each ply \nwhen the circular cutout is reinforced by a pair of the laminate rings (case 1.3) or fibre tow \nrings (case 1.4), and both cases are compared with the un-reinforced cutout (case 1.2). These \nstress values correspond to a particular calculation point within the strain gauge covered area \nthat is marked as point A in Fig.1; they are not the average stress values over the strain gauge \nregion. Fig 3(a) shows the principal stress in the beam web around the cutout. In terms of the \nstress relief around the cutout, the fibre tow ring reduces more stress in the 45o ply, whereas it \nis less effective in reducing the 0o ply stress comparing to the laminate ring case. Fig. 3(b) \nshows the principal stress in the laminate ring and fibre tow ring. The laminated ring picks up \nmore stress by the 0o and 45o plies, but it is less effective in the -45o and 90o plies.    \nDouble cutouts with the circular cutout near the clamping end (cases 2.1, 2.2 & 2.3) \nCases in example 2 were studied under the same load (P = 20 kN) and support conditions. \nFigure 4 shows an FE calculated contour of the principal stress for the unreinforced cutouts \n(case 2.1). Although there is little interaction effect of the two cutouts, the stress \nconcentration at the circular cutout is more severe than that of singular cutout (case 1.2 Fig. \n2a) due to the additional diamond cutout. The hot spot is still at point A where strain gauges \nwere mounted. The maximum principal stress is 193 MPa, whereas for the single circular \ncutout the maximum principal stress is 167 MPa   \nA summary of FE stress and strain results is presented in Table 5. When the cutouts are \nreinforced by a pair of laminated composite rings (case 2.2) or steel rings (case 2.3), stress \nconcentration reduction is significant in all stress components. In terms of the principal stress \n(\u03c31), the reduction of the maximum stress is 42% when the laminated rings are bonded \n(\u03c31_unreinforced = 138 MPa vs. \u03c31_laminate_ring = 79 MPa), and the reduction is increased to 49% \nwhen using the steel rings (138 MPa vs. 70 MPa).  \nThese reinforcement rings were bonded and cured at 50oC. Therefore for the steel ring case, \ndue to the mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion, some thermal residual stresses \nwill be present on the rings and the web at the room temperature (25oC). However, the \ntemperature difference of 25oC is small and the strain gauges were mounted after the curing \nprocess in room temperature and the strain data acquisition device was set to zero at the \n 8 \nbeginning of the test. Therefore, residual stresses arising from the bonding process at elevated \ntemperature are not taken into account in this work.  \nIn the absence of the thermal residual stresses, the stiffness of the rings influences the load \ntransfer capability between the beam web and the reinforcement rings. According to eq. (1) \nand assigning E1a and E1b with the elastic modulus of the steel (193 MPa) and quasi-isotropic \nlaminate (64.7 MPa), ta and tb the thickness of the steel (1.5 mm) and laminate rings (2 mm), \nrespectively, the stiffness ratio of the two rings is 2.24.  \nIn terms of the FE calculated principal stress (Table 5), the stresses picked up by the steel and \nlaminate rings are 177 MPa and 77 MPa, respectively. These give a stress ratio of 2.30, which \nis very close to the stiffness ratio of 2.24.  Therefore it can be said that in the absence of the \ncuring residual stresses the stress transfer capability is mainly governed by the stiffness of the \ndoubler rings. In this case the steel rings are much more effective than the composite laminate \nrings even though they are 25% thinner at 1.5 mm comparing to the 2 mm thick laminate \nrings. However, the steel rings are much heavier than that of the composite laminate rings. In \nthis case the weight of the steel ring is 0.26 kg (based on steel density of 8000 kg\/m3) whereas \nthe weight of the laminate ring is only 0.08 kg (based on laminate density of 1580 kg\/m3) \u2013 a \nfactor of 3.25. A trade off between the load carrying capability and structural weight is \nimportant in a balanced design.  \nFigure 5 presents the principal stress in each ply when the circular cutout is reinforced by a \npair of laminate rings (case 2.2) or steel rings (case 2.3) and a comparison with the un-\nreinforced cutout (case 2.1). The stress values presented in Fig. 5 correspond to a particular \nFE model point within the strain gauge covered area that is marked as point A in Fig. 1. \nFirstly, Fig 5(a) shows that stresses are lower in the reinforced beam web in all plies. In terms \nof the stress relief in the beam web around the cutout, the steel rings are more effective than \nthe laminate rings due to its much higher stiffness (stiffness ratio of the two rings is 2.24). \nThe steel rings are also effective for all laminate orientations due to its isotropic properties. \nThis contrasts to the fibre tow rings (case 1.4), which works well only in the local fibre \ndirection. Fig. 5(b) shows the principal stress in the laminate rings and steel rings. The \nlaminate rings pick up more stress by the 0o and 45o plies, but the -45o and 90o plies are less \neffective. The average stress in the steel ring is about 156 MPa, whereas the average stress \nover the eight-ply laminate ring is about 75 MPa \u2013 giving a ratio of 2.1 for stress transfer \ncapability.     \nDouble cutouts with the diamond cutout near the clamping end (cases 3.2 & 3.3) \nFor the study cases in example 3 under the same loading (P=20 kN) and support conditions, a \nsummary of FE strain and stress results is presented in Table 6. \nAs example 2, the stress concentration reduction is significant in all stress components when \nthe cutouts are reinforced by a pair of laminated composite rings (cases 3.2) or steel rings \n(case 3.3) as summarised in Table 6. In terms of the principal stress (\u03c31), the reduction of the \n 9 \nmaximum local stress is 27% (94 MPa vs. 69 MPa) if using the laminated rings, and the \nreduction is increased to 41% (94 MPa vs. 55 MPa) when using the steel rings. The \nmagnitude of stress reduction is also significant as in cases 2.2 and 2.3. The same comments \nhold for the predominant effect of the ring material stiffness as discussed for Example 2.  \n4. Validation and discussions \nFour beam samples with different cutout and reinforcement designs were manufactured and \ntested. These were the samples for case 1.2, 1.4, 2.2 and 2.3 (Table 2). Photographs in Fig. 6 \nshow beam samples mounted in the test rig for the study case 1.4 and 2.2. Strains were \nmeasured at points A and B by mounting strain gauge rosettes each consisting three gauges in \nthe x, y and 45o directions. Additional strain measurement was performed for case 2.3 at the \ndiamond cutout and this is denoted as case 2.3D in the following result presentations.   \nComparisons of the measured and FE calculated strains are given in Table 7. The strains in \ncase 2.3D were measured at point A\u2019 as shown in Fig. 1e for the diamond cutout near the load \nend. Since the strain gauge position A\u2019 is on the lower half of the beam specimen, the strain \nreadings reverse the sign. Take the x-axis strain as example which is the most concerned \nstrain component in the beam bending problem. For the single cutout, the relative error in \u03b5x \nfor case 1.2 is 6% and for case 1.4 is 1.1%. For the double cutouts the relative error for case \n2.3D is 6.5% and the worst case is for test 2.3 with error 19.5%. The agreement between the \nmeasurements and FE results are fairly good for the x-axis strains. For the y-axis and shear \nstrain components, there are occasional disparity between the FE and the experimental results. \nHowever, we do not feel that this is significant.  \nFigure 7 presents a comparison of the stress components obtained by the tests and FEA. The \n\u201ctest\u201d stresses are calculated by multiplying the measured strain values with the equivalent \nelastic modulus. The agreement is generally good.   \nConclusions \nNumerical modelling and experimental tests have been conducted to study the stress \nconcentration around cutout edges in a composite C-section beam under the in-plane shear \nload. Following conclusions can be drawn.  \nWithout edge reinforcement a diamond-shape cutout reduces stress concentration by about \n16% comparing to a circular cutout.  \nFor a circular or diamond cutout, edge reinforcement by bonding a pair of rings made of a \nsteel alloy, carbon composite laminate, or fibre tows, has shown effective stress reduction. In \nthe absence of the thermal residual stresses arising from elevated temperature curing process, \nthe stiffness ratio of the ring to the substrate plays the most important role in quantifying the \namount of load transfer from the substrate to the reinforcement rings.  \nFor the same geometries, rings made by the steel alloy provide the most effective stress \nreduction around cutout edges. Rings fabricated by the fibre tow placement technique rank the \n 10 \nsecond. However, the weight penalty by the steel rings is three times more than that of carbon \nfibre rings, whereas the magnitude of stress reduction offered by the steel ring is about 1.24 \ntimes of that by the fibre tow rings.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors are grateful to Caden Stiles for his contribution to some of the experimental tests.  \n \nReferences \n1.
