Until recently, these cell types have been grouped\ninto two broad families: totipotent and lineage-restricted\n(somatic) stem cell types. Totipotent stem cells (such as\nembryonic stem cells) are characterized by their ability to\ncontribute to every lineage in the body, as exemplified in vivo\nby the formation of germ-line competent chimaeras following\ninjection into host blastocysts, or in vitro by differentiation into\nmultiple lineages under selected tissue culture conditions.\nAdult somatic stem cells have also been characterized for many\ntissues (Spangrude et al., 1991; Gage et al., 1995; Watt, 1998)\nand although possessing substantial capacity to proliferate, it\nwas believed that such cells were capable of differentiation into\na limited number of cell types. In the past few years there has\nbeen increasing evidence that adult stem cells may have a far\ngreater differentiation plasticity than previously thought. Bone\nmarrow is capable of turning into skeletal muscle (Ferrari et\nal., 1998); skeletal muscle can turn back into blood (Gussoni\net al., 1999; Jackson et al., 1999); brain can turn into blood\n(Bjornson et al., 1999) and back again (Eglitis and Mezey,\n1997; Brazelton et al., 2000; Mezey et al., 2000); and bone\nmarrow can turn into liver (Petersen et al., 1999; Theise et al.,\n2000a; Theise et al., 2000b; Henegariu and Krause, 2000;\nLagasse et al., 2000). Nevertheless major questions remain in\nrelation to the limits of plasticity in somatic cells and to what\nextent the observed reprogramming phenomena derive from\ncell sub-populations, from transformation events that have\noccurred within donor cell populations when in culture\n(Morshead et al., 2002), or as a result of cell fusion (Ying et\nal., 2002). One route to addressing these issues may be to\nexamine those adult stem cell populations that are most\nspecialised and\/or have widest potential for differentiation. In\nthis regard, bone marrow cells have been the model of choice\nfor many researchers. Labelled bone marrow cells injected into\nadult mice have been shown to express proteins characteristic\nof neuronal phenotypes in the brain (Brazelton et al., 2000),\nand it was recently shown that a single bone marrow cell could\npopulate multiple tissues of irradiated host animals (Krause et\nal., 2001). Also while the functional significance of many of\nthe reprogramming\/transdifferentiation experiments has still to\nbe established, bone marrow cells have been shown to home to\ndamaged target organs and replace injured tissues. For\nexample, bone marrow cells transplanted into infarcted\nmycoardium were able to create new myocardial tissue (Orlic\net al.., 2001), and they have been shown to \u2018home\u2019 to damaged\nmuscle in irradiated dystrophic mdx mice (Ferrari et al., 1998;\nGussoni, 1999). Bone marrow contains a mesenchymal stem\n3967\nSkin and hair follicle stem cell biology is the focus of\nincreasing interest, not least because the adult hair follicle\nhas well defined dermal and epithelial populations that\ndisplay distinct developmental properties. Recent evidence\nsuggests that a number of adult cell populations have much\nbroader stem cell capabilities than previously thought. To\nexamine whether this applied to the hair follicle, and with\na view to developing the follicle as a stem cell model system\nwe investigated whether adult hair follicles were capable\nof demonstrating haematopoietic stem cell activity. To\ninvestigate haematopoietic activity in hair follicles we\nfirst used in vitro haematopoietic colony assays. This\ndemonstrated that rodent hair follicle end bulbs as well as\nmicro-dissected dermal papilla and dermal sheath cells\nactively produced cells of erythroid and myeloid lineages\nbut that follicle epithelial cells did not. As a more stringent\ntest, we then transplanted cultured dermal papilla or\ndermal sheath cells from transgenically marked donor mice\ninto lethally irradiated recipient mice and observed multi-\nlineage haematopoietic reconstitution when assayed at\nintervals of up to one year. Colony assays from bone\nmarrow of primary recipients revealed that over 70%\nof clonogenic precursors were derived from donor hair\nfollicle cells. When bone marrow from primary mice was\nharvested and used to repopulate secondary myeloablated\nrecipients, multi-lineage haematopoietic engraftment was\nobserved. Our data show that dermal but not epidermal\ncompartments of the adult hair follicle have much broader\nstem cell activities than previously described. Although the\ntreatment for many forms of blood disorder, such as\nleukemia, often requires transplantation of haematopoietic\nstem cells (HSC), their availability can be rate limiting.\nGiven its easy accessibility, our identification of the hair\nfollicle as a source of extramedullary haematopoietic stem\ncell activity makes it an attractive potential source for\nblood stem cell therapeutics and highlights its value as a\nmodel system in adult stem cell biology. \nKey words: Hair follicle, Dermal papilla, Dermal sheath,\nHaematopoietic stem cell \nSummary\nHair follicle dermal cells repopulate the mouse\nhaematopoietic system\nMajlinda Lako, Lyle Armstrong, Paul M.

By isolating\nsmall numbers of human bone marrow cells using density\ngradient centrifugation and showing that they could be induced\nto differentiate into adipocytic, chondrocytic or osteocytic\nlineages, Pittenger et al. provided good evidence that bone\nmarrow contains a multipotent mesenchymal stem cell\npopulation rather than a mixture of committed progenitor\npopulations (Pittenger et al., 1999). \nHowever, if the plasticity of stem cells is ever to be used in\ntherapeutics, ease of access to stem cell repositories will be\nvery important and the provision of mesenchymal stem cells\nfrom bone marrow requires bone marrow extraction and cell\nsorting. Several research groups have investigated alternative\nsources of adult stem cells. Adipocytes obtained from\nsubcutaneous fat by liposuction have been shown to produce\nosteogenic, chondrogenic and myogenic derivatives (Zuk et al.,\n2001), but no blood or nerve cells. Stem cells obtained from\nskin dermis can produce neural as well as mesodermal\nderivatives (Toma et al., 2001), but the origin of this stem cell\npopulation is unclear, as the initial dermal population is\nheterogeneous. However, cells of the hair follicle are highly\naccessible and can also be isolated as discrete populations.\nUnlike some of the cell types whose stem cell potential is\nbeing investigated, hair follicle dermal cells derive from an\norgan that is unique in the adult mammal in terms of its range\nof developmental activities. There is increasing evidence that\nfollicles contain stem cells that play key roles for skin as a\nwhole, and within the follicle, the lineage relationships\nbetween the dermal cell populations is well defined (Taylor et\nal., 2000; Oshima et al., 2001). Hair follicle dermal cells are\nperhaps best considered as embryonic type cells retained in an\nadult system, and flexible in their range of activities, rather than\nspecialised adult stem cells. The embryonic-like properties of\nthe hair follicle dermal cells derive from the fact that they\nsegregate from intrafollicular dermis relatively early on in\nfollicle development and assume characteristic morphological\nand molecular phenotypes. Experimentally we have shown that\nadult hair follicle dermal cells have unparalleled capacity to\ninduce hair growth when combined with different epidermal\npartners (Jahoda and Reynolds, 1996). Recently we\ntransplanted follicle dermal sheath tissue from one person to\nanother and showed that it induced follicles that grew hair\nwithout undergoing the rejection process normally associated\nwith allografts (Reynolds et al., 1999). Therefore dermal\nsheath cells would appear to possess a degree of\nimmunoprivilege that underlines their potential for use as\nuniversal donors in stem cell-based therapies. When the hair\nfollicle base is experimentally amputated, residual cells of the\ndermal sheath (DS; Fig. 1) replace the main inductive dermal\nelement the dermal papilla (DP), and restore hair growth in a\nunique example of mammalian regeneration. Thus there is also\nclear mesenchymal cell lineage transition from DS to DP cells,\nin this case (apparently) mediated by the follicle epithelium\n(Reynolds and Jahoda, 1996).\nFollicle epithelial cells are increasingly studied in relation to\nskin stem cell and tumor biology. It has long been recognized\nthat in wounded skin new epidermis can derive from skin\nappendages. However, recent work using sophisticated cell\nlabeling techniques provides evidence that follicle epithelial\nstem cells are involved in the continuous physiological process\nof epidermal replacement in normal healthy skin (Taylor et al.,\n2000). Interactions between adjacent cells of different types are\na major theme in many areas of developmental biology. In\nmammals, interactions between cells derived from the\nembryonic ectoderm and mesoderm are central to the\ndevelopment of many structures, including skin, teeth,\nmammary glands and the digestive and nervous systems. The\nmammalian hair follicle provides a particularly useful model\nfor studying these phenomena (Kratochwil et al., 1996).\nFollicles are conveniently located in the skin of the animal. The\ndevelopmental interactions persist into adulthood, in the course\nof wound repair and normal follicle growth cycling. Most\nimportantly, hair follicles contain readily identified populations\nof interacting cells that are clustered in discrete sites. Each cell\ntype can be isolated and continues to show pronounced\ninteractive abilities when cultured in vitro. Thus the hair\nfollicle is turning out to be not only a key stem cell repository\nwithin skin, but also a major developmental model. Further,\ngiven that access to stem cells of the skin is a relatively simple\nprocedure (biopsy) compared with stem cells of (for example)\nthe brain or bone marrow, the therapeutic potential and\nplasticity of follicle stem cells needs to be explored. In our\nlaboratory it was previously observed that hair follicle dermal\npapilla and dermal sheath cultures generated cells expressing\na variety of blood cell markers (A. J. Reynolds, personal\ncommunication). Moreover, the collagen capsule of vibrissa\nfollicles encloses sinus cavities, and after extended organ\nculture of totally isolated follicles we observed the\naccumulation of high numbers of non-erythrocyte blood cells\nadjacent to the dermal sheath within these structures. These\nobservations indicated that endogenous haematopoietic\nprogenitor activity could occur within the dermal compartment\nof the follicle. Given that the therapeutic need for alternate\nsources of haematopoietic stem cells is most pressing, we set\nout to investigate directly the haematopoietic potential of these\nhair follicle dermal populations. In this paper we report that\nthe follicle dermal sheath and dermal papilla show\nhaematopoietic activity in vitro and cells cultured from these\nstructures can contribute to the regeneration of the entire\nhaematopoietic system of lethally irradiated mice in vivo.\nMaterials and Methods\nIsolation of follicle end bulbs and individual components\nFollicle end bulbs were isolated as previously described (Reynolds\nand Jahoda, 1991). In brief, the proximal tips of adult Zin40 mouse\nvibrissa follicles, exposed on the internal surface of mystacial skin\nflaps, were removed and placed in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium\n(MEM; Gibco BRL) containing antibiotics. To isolate dermal and\nepithelial components from the end bulb, the outer collagen capsule\nwas inverted and the dermal sheath (DS) layer, and epidermal matrix\nwere then delicately eased away from around the dermal papillae\n(DP). Papillae were isolated by basal stalk severance and the\nremaining cups of DS tissue detached from the collagen capsule.\nEstablishment and maintenance of DP and DS cell cultures\nCell culture was performed as previously described (Jahoda and\nOliver, 1981). Around a dozen papillae, or pieces of sheath tissue were\npooled and cultured in 35 mm Petri dishes. All explants were initially\nmaintained in MEM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FCS,\nGibco BRL; Renfrew, UK) at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. The cultures were\nJournal of Cell Science 115 (20)\n3969Follicle-derived haematopoietic activity \nroutinely passaged as described elsewhere (Reynolds and Jahoda,\n1991).\nColony forming unit (CFU) assays\nCFU-GEMM assay\nCFU-GEMM assays were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Stem Cell Technologies; Vancouver, Canada), In brief,\n3\u00b7 104 cells in a total volume of 0.3 ml were added to 3 ml of\nMethocult medium yielding triplicate cultures of 1.1 ml each.\nMethocult containing cells was dispensed into three 35 mm dishes\nusing a 16G blunt-end needle. Two plates were then placed into a 100\nmm covered dish containing a third uncovered dish containing 3 ml\nof sterile water. Cultures were then placed in a 37\u00b0C incubator\nmaintained with 5% CO2 and >95% humidity. The concentration of\ncytokines in Methocult is as follows: IL-3 (10 ng\/ml); IL-6 (10 ng\/ml),\nSCF (50 ng\/ml), Epo (3 units\/ml). Dissected parts from the hair\nfollicle were placed on top of methocult (7-8 in total) and plates were\nincubated as above.\nCFU-A assay\nThe in vitro CFU-A assay was set up as described previously\n(Pragnell et al., 1988). In brief, a feeder layer consisting of 0.6%\nagar in a modified Eagle\u2019s medium ( a -MEM; Gibco BRL) with\nconditioned medium from two cell lines (AF1-19T, a source of\ngranulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF; and\nL929, a source of M-CSF) was poured into 3 cm diameter tissue\nculture grade dishes (1 ml per layer). Dissected DP and DS (5-6 per\nplate) were placed on top of the 0.3% agar and a -MEM mixture to\nform the upper layer. When DP or DS cells were assayed, 3 \u00b7 104\ncells were added to 0.3% agar in a -MEM and plated to form an\nupper layer. The dishes were incubated for 11 days at 37\u00b0C in a\nhumidified atmosphere with 5% O2 and 10% CO2. The presence\nor absence of haematopoietic progeny was determined by the\nformation of mixed colonies of neutrophils and macrophages with\ndiameters greater than 2 mm after 11 days of incubation. The mixed\nnature of the developing colonies and the high proliferative capacity\nof the clonogenic cell, alongside data on radiation sensitivity,\nanatomical location and sensitivity to mitotic poison indicates that\nthis assay detects a primitive haematopoietic cell analogous to\nCFU-S (Pragnell et al., 1988; Graham et al., 1990).\nStem cell transplantation\nDP and DS cells from Zin40 mice cultured as described above were\nharvested by trypsinisation. 20,000 cells were mixed with 200,000\nnucleated bone marrow cells from Balb\/c mice and injected\nintravenously into recipient Balb\/c mice that had received 1.2 Gy of\ng -irradiation. Recipients received prophylactic aureomycin in drinking\nwater. For transplantation into secondary recipients, bone marrow was\nharvested from the primary mice and 2 \u00b7 106 nucleated cells were\ninjected into each secondary Balb\/c recipient, prepared as described\nabove.\nAnalysis of transplant recipients\nBone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood were collected from both\nprimary and secondary sacrificed recipients and DNA was extracted\nusing the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega,\nSouthampton, UK). Thirty five cycles of 94\u00b0C (1 minute), 62\u00b0C\n(1 minute) and 72\u00b0C (1 minute) were used to amplify lacZ from\n100 ng of genomic DNA with the following primer pair: 5 \u00a2 -\nCGCTCACATTTAATGTTGATGAAAGC and 5 \u00a2 -TCCAGATAA-\nCTGCCGTCACTCCAA. A second PCR was performed with murine\nWnt8b specific primers 5\u00a2 -AACGTGGGCTTCGGAGAGGC and 5 \u00a2 -\nGCCCGCGCCCTGCAGCAGGT as an internal control.\nResults\nThe proximal tips of adult mouse and rat vibrissae follicles\nwere assessed for haematopoietic potential by two in vitro\ncolony forming unit assays, CFU-GEMM and CFU-A. We\ninitially dissected the proximal tips of the vibrissae follicles\ninto three parts: end bulbs, medium and top (Fig. 1) and\nsubjected them to CFU-GEMM assay (Fig. 2). In three\nindependent experiments 100% of the mouse and rat end bulbs\nproduced macroscopic colonies containing cells of erythroid\nand myeloid lineages (Fig. 2A). 68% of the medium parts of\nvibrissae also produced macroscopic colonies containing cells\nof myeloid lineages, but not erythroid cells (Fig. 2B), while\nonly 11.2% the top part of the vibrissae showed some small\ncolonies containing cells of the myeloid lineage (Fig. 2C). To\nidentify which follicle structures contained haematopoietic\npotential we then micro-dissected the end bulb of mouse and\nrat vibrissae into their constituent parts: epithelium, dermal\nsheath (DS) and dermal papilla (DP), and assessed each\nindividually by CFU-GEMM assay. Mixed haematopoietic\ncolony formation was found to be associated exclusively with\nthe DS (Fig. 2D) and DP (Fig. 2E). No haematopoietic activity\nwas observed with the epithelial structures (Fig. 2F). We then\nrepeated the same experiments using the second assay, CFU-\nA, which identifies a primitive haematopoietic precursor,\nequivalent to CFU-S (Pragnell et al., 1988). Similarly to the\nCFU-mix, 100% of end bulbs (Fig. 3A) and 70% of the\nmedium part of vibrissae produced haematopoietic colonies\ncontaining granulocytes and neutrophils in the CFU-A assay;\nhowever, only 14.2% of the top parts showed colony formation\n(Table 1). Dissection of DP and DS from both mouse and rat\nend bulbs indicated that haematopoietic activity was closely\nassociated with them (Fig. 3B,C,E,F) and not with the\nepithelial component. In contrast, aorta and peripheral blood\nfailed to generate haematopoietic colonies when tested using\nthe same assay.\nWe then established primary explant cultures of DS and DP\nFig. 1. Schematic presentation of the hair follicle. Black lines\nindicate the plane of dissection used to separate the end bulb,\nmedium and top section of the vibrissa (see Fig. 2).\n3970\ncells and carried out CFU-A assays on cells passaged from 1\nto 3 times (Fig. 4A,B). Both DS and DP cell cultures displayed\nhaematopoietic activity as shown by the production of\nlarge haematopoietic colonies in CFU-A assays that were\nindistinguishable from those formed by conventional bone-\nmarrow-derived progenitors (Fig. 4C,D). Flow cytometry of\nthe DP or DS cultures with anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody\n(PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was unable to detect pre-formed\nhaematopoietic cells at this level of analysis; however, CD45\ncells were detected in the colonies formed in the CFU-A\nassays. Coupled with the comparatively small number of\nhaematopoietic colonies formed (approximately 1 in 6000 DP\nor DS cells plated in CFU assay), these data suggest that if pre-\nformed haematopoietic progenitors are present there must be\nonly relatively small numbers in each follicle. \nAlthough the CFU data we obtained from both the dissected\nDP and DS and their respective cultures strongly suggested the\npresence of primitive haematopoietic potential, these in vitro\nassays detect haematopoietic progenitors that include, but are\nnot exclusively, HSC. To determine the presence of HSC\nactivity in these cultures, we assessed their capacity to generate\nlong-term multi-lineage haematopoietic reconstitution of\nmyeloablated recipient animals. For this we used a competitive\nrepopulation transplantation assay (Harrison, 1980), in which\na given cell population is required to compete in the same\nrecipient with a genetically distinguishable standard source of\nhaematopoietic stem cell activity. Nucleated cells from\nunfractionated bone marrow of Balb\/c mice (2\u00b7 105 cells per\nanimal) and cultured DS or DP cells from Zin40 mice (2 \u00b7 104\ncells per animal) were injected intravenously into lethally\nirradiated Balb\/c recipients. Zin40 mice were used as the\nsource of donor tissue because they carry a transgene (LacZ);\nthus cells derived from the hair follicle could be distinguished\nfrom host or carrier bone marrow by genotype. Analysis using\nPCR is preferable to flow cytometry studies using fluororescein\ndi-galactoside since our experience has shown high\nbackground staining of mouse tissues using this technique.\nBetween 4 and 5 months post-irradiation we sacrificed eight\ntransplanted mice and extracted DNA from the spleen, bone\nmarrow and peripheral blood. PCR analysis for lacZ indicated\nthe presence of dermal-derived cells in the recipient peripheral\nblood, spleen and bone marrow (Fig. 5A; Table 2). A semi-\nquantitative analysis of lacZ detection using variable\npercentages of transgenic and wild-type splenocytes show that\nthis assay can detect low percentages of lacZ-labelled cells\nagainst a wild-type background (Fig. 5C). We sacrificed one\nJournal of Cell Science 115 (20)\nFig. 2. Follicle tissues display\nhaematopoietic activity in vitro.

We also sorted splenocytes from the\nrecipient females into different subpopulations (e.g. B cells, T\ncells, myeloid cells) using immunomagnetic cell sorting\n(Miltenyi Biotech) and examined each for the presence of the\ntransgene. Dermal-derived cells were found to have\ncontributed to all haematopoietic lineages studied (Fig. 5B).\nThe proportion of clonogenic haematopoietic precursors that\nwere derived from the transgenic dermal cultures was then\nassessed by limiting dilution CFU-A analysis of recipient bone\nmarrow. In three recipients that had received a mixture of DP\nand bone marrow cells, 72%, 73% and 75% of colonies formed\nfrom their bone marrow were found to be transgenic by PCR.\nSimilarly, with two recipients that had received a mixture of\nDS and bone marrow cells, 80% and 77% of the colonies were\ntransgenic. Although in our opinion this is strong evidence that\ncells of the DP and DS contain HSC activity, we then tested\nthis further by transplanting bone marrow from the primary\nrecipients into myeloablated secondary recipients as a robust\ntest of stem cell competence. PCR analysis of the peripheral\nblood, spleen and bone marrow of these secondary mice 8\nweeks post-irradiation indicated the presence of dermal-\nderived cells (Table 2). We have also found transgenic\nhaematopoietic cells in all leukocyte populations that have\nbeen tested from these secondary recipients. Moreover, PCR\nanalysis on single CFU-A colonies from the bone marrow of\ntwo secondary mice showed that 58% and 77% of colonies\nrespectively were lacZ positive.\nDiscussion\nThe data presented show that cells derived from the dermal\nstructures of the hair follicle have intriguing haematopoietic\npotential. Cells within the DS and DP generate haematopoietic\ncolonies in vitro, and can contribute to all blood lineages in\nvivo for at least 13 months post-transplantation. These\ntransplanted cells retain this regenerative potential when\ntransferred to secondary recipients indicating their primitive\nstem cell nature. This follicle-derived activity appears to be\ngeneral since we obtained similar in vitro results using rat and\nmouse follicle tissues. Therefore, in relation to therapeutic\nTable 2.

We can then\nbegin to ask where the precise cellular origin of this\nphenomenon originates?\nThe hair follicle has been shown to be associated with\ndifferentiated blood cells in situ such as CD4+ and CD8+\nT cells, Langerhans cells, macrophages and mast cells\n(Christoph et al., 2000). It is also vascularised so there is a\nfinite possibility that what we observed was due to the\npresence of haematopoietic stem cells carried in the\nperipheral blood or, potentially, recruited from the endothelial\ncells themselves. To address this, we investigated the\nhaematopoietic potential of aorta and peripheral blood and\nthey both failed to show haematopoietic activity in our in\nvitro assays. In view of this data and the high proportion of\nfollicles demonstrating haematopoietic activity it is likely\nthat what we have seen with the hair-follicle-derived cells is\na product of endogenous activity for which there are at least\nthree possible explanations, none of which can be entirely\nexcluded. One is that the apparently lineage-restricted dermal\ncells undergo a general reprogramming, possibly via\nextracellular cues from the new microenvironment into which\nthey are introduced. There are many recent reports involving\nadult cell populations once considered to be lineage\nrestricted, showing greater differentiation plasticity, several\nof which have involved haematopoietic stem cell activity\n(Jackson et al., 1999; Gussoni et al., 1999; Bjornson et al.,\n1999). Our current observations tend to argue against a\ngeneral reprogramming event. Although nearly all follicles\ndemonstrated endogenous haematopoietic activity, the fact\nthat 1 in 6000 of cultured cells plated in the CFU experiments\nhad haematopoietic potential suggests that these cells may be\nquite rare within each follicle. In spite of this, the dermal\ncultures appear to be at least as potent as conventional bone\nmarrow, the high percentage of follicle-derived clonogenic\ncells in recipient animals suggesting, indeed, that these cell\ntypes may be capable of out-competing conventional bone\nmarrow HSC. This result is similar to that found in work with\nstem cells obtained from skeletal muscle (Jackson et al.,\n1999). Another alternative is that follicles contain a small\nresident population of haematopoietic stem cells. Although\nwe are confident that the follicle-associated HSC activity is\nnot a consequence of residual peripheral blood within the\ndermal structures, we cannot exclude the possibility that\nthe activity is a result of prior HSC recruitment from\nconventional haematopoietic sites. In this context, a recent\nreport has shown that adult muscle-derived haematopoietic\nstem cell activity emanates from cells that are haematopoietic\nin origin (McKinney-Freeman et al., 2002). Our current work\nis aimed at distinguishing this possibility from the first one,\nand from the third option, which is that there are small\nnumbers of permissive stem cells resident in the hair follicle\ndermis that possess multi-potency. In this context a single\nbone-marrow-derived stem cell has been shown to contribute\nto a number of different organ systems (Krause et al., 2001).\nMoreover, it was recently reported (Toma et al., 2001) that\nstem cells derived from skin dermis could be grown and\ndifferentiated in culture to produce multiple differentiation\nproducts including neurons and glia. This work suggests that\nthere may be a multipotent stem cell present in the dermis of\nskin whose origin is unknown. Within skin, the hair follicle\nis seen as providing a discrete well-protected niche, and the\nfollicle epithelium has recently been the focus of much skin\nstem cell and tumor biology research (Taylor et al., 2000;\nOshima et al., 2001; Jahoda and Reynolds, 2000). In the\ncurrent work we found no evidence of haematopoietic activity\nfrom epithelial tissue isolated from the lower follicle.\nMoreover, the sections of follicle above the base, which\nJournal of Cell Science 115 (20)\nFig. 5. (A) PCR analysis shows that cells from the follicle dermis reconstitute bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood of recipients. The lacZ\ngene was detected in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen of the Zin40 donor mouse, but not in the control recipients (Balb\/c). M15\nand M16 were transplanted with 2 \u00b7 104 Zin40 dermal sheath cultured cells and 2 \u00b7 105 Balb\/c bone marrow cells. M18 and M28 were\ntransplanted with 2 \u00b7 104 Zin40 dermal papilla cultured cells and 2 \u00b7 105 Balb\/c bone marrow cells. NC, no DNA control. (B) Dermal-derived\ncells contribute to all haematopoietic lineages studied: confirmation by PCR. (A) Splenocytes from Balb\/c recipient animals transplanted with\ndermal cells derived from LacZ transgenic animals (Zin40) were sorted into subpopulations (total leukocytes, CD45+; non-haematopoietic\nnucleated cells, CD45\u2013; B cells, B220+; T cells, CD4+\/CD8a+; and myeloid cells, CD11b and Ly6) and presence of transgenic leukocytes\ndetermined by PCR. A second PCR was performed with Wnt8b primers as a loading control. (C) Detection of transgenic donor cells by PCR.\nMixtures of splenocytes from transgenic and non-transgenic animals were mixed in differing ratios from 100% transgenic to 0% transgenic and\nsubjected to PCR for LacZ and Wnt8b.\n3973Follicle-derived haematopoietic activity \nincorporate the main epithelial stem cell compartments\nincluding the bulge region, revealed a reduced\nhaematopoietic response compared with the end bulb. This\nhighlights the follicle dermis as a separate location for\nprogenitor activity. In a recent paper we suggested that, just\nas follicle epithelial cells are a major stem cell source for skin\nepidermis in wound healing, so follicle dermal cells might\nplay the equivalent role in replacing dermal cells in dermal\nrepair (Jahoda and Reynolds, 2001). In the light of recent\nevidence that follicle epithelial stem cells are involved in the\ncontinuous physiological process of replacement of\nepidermis in normal healthy skin (Taylor et al., 2000), we also\nhypothesised that follicle dermal cells might be involved\nin regulating the cellularity of normal dermis. The\nhaematopoietic activity evident in the current study now gives\nrise to the idea that, within skin, the protected environment\nof the hair follicle is a key repository for a broad range of\nstem cell activities. In this context it is interesting that in the\npaper describing neuronal cell differentiation from skin\ndermis (Toma et al., 2001), all the skin used for the\nexperiments contained hair follicles. \nOur observation that hair follicles possess cells with\nendogenous haematopoietic activity could have considerable\ndermatological significance. There is growing interest in hair\nfollicle immunology and evidence that the follicle has a unique\nimmunological profile (Paus et al., 1999; Gilliam et al., 1998;\nWestgate et al., 1991). Therefore, it is possible to envisage that\nthe capacity to produce haematopoietic cells locally in skin\ncould play a role in, for example, wound healing and immune\nsurveillance. This might be true, especially in view of the\nrecent reports that the hair follicle can serve as an immediate\nreservoir of Langerhans cells between bone marrow and\nepidermis (Gilliam et al., 1998). By contrast, if it turns out that\nthe follicle harbors a few multi-potent stem cells, then the\neffects that we have observed could be just a manifestation of\nthe different environmental conditions that these cells are being\nput into. In any event, this does not detract from the essential\nfact that hair-follicle-derived cells can be turned into blood for\npractical purposes. \nThe implications for such new sources of HSC for potential\ntherapy have been highlighted elsewhere (Saba et al., 2000).\nHowever, follicle-derived HSC activity may be of particular\nrelevance to the human condition. It is now well established\nthat rodent hair follicles display immune privilege, and our\nwork and that of others has indicated that this is true for human\ndermal sheath cells (Paus et al., 1999; Reynolds et al., 1999);\nsuch cells may therefore prove to be admirable donor cell types\nin stem-cell-based therapies. Further, the ability to readily\naccess dermal cell populations by skin biopsy, rather than a\npotentially more invasive procedure required for other stem\ncell types may make them particularly appropriate as a source\nof autologous or allogeneic HSC activity.\nNote added in proof\nRecent observations indicate that some haematopoietic activity\nmay not be seen under in vitro culture conditions that promote\nhair growth in vitro.\nThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust, Leukaemia\nResearch Fund and BBSRC.\nReferences\nBjornson, C.
