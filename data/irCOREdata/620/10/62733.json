Introduction21\n22\nInhalation of atmospheric aerosols, particularly of the fine size-fraction, can cause23\nlung diseases, and regulatory standards exist to ensure that air quality meets interna-24\ntionally defined standards. Airborne particulate matter (APM) for PM2.5 and PM10 is25\nnow widely monitored, particularly in urban environments. Nevertheless, government26\nagencies and local authorities rarely have the resources to install equipment at the27\nmany sites that would be needed to map the spatial distribution of airborne particles.28\nNormal practice for monitoring metals in APM is to establish installations at a few29\nfixed locations, as in the Heavy Metals Monitoring Networks in the United Kingdom30\n(Brown et al., 2007).31\nTypical of this approach is the study of Moreno et al. (2004) who analysed APM32\nat five sites in England and Wales. They showed that the air in Sheffield contained33\nmany metal-bearing particles in the <PM2.5 size-fraction. Those containing Cd and34\nNi are likely to derive from large steel works (Buse et al., 2003) and to impair health35\nwhen inhaled. Attempts to apportion the particles to particular sources of metals in36\nAPM include chemical mass balance (Wang et al., 2006; Samara et al., 2003) and37\nmultivariate statistical analyses (Kim et al., 2006; Shah et al., 2006). Thomaidis et38\nal. (2003) incorporated meteorological variables in their multivariate analysis because39\nthey found these influenced the concentrations of Cd, Ni and As in the APM in Athens.40\nSweet and Vermette (1993) studied anthropogenic emissions in urban Illinois based41\non trace metal data from three sites; they reported much temporal variation in the42\nquantity of metal in the APM. They attributed this to variations in wind strength43\nand direction, and the degree of atmospheric mixing. Atmospheric particulate matter44\nin towns and cities is readily resuspended, and this process contributes significantly45\nto temporal (Vermette et al., 1991) and spatial variation in the contents of metals46\n(Kuang et al., 2004). So mapping the spatial distribution from direct measurements47\nwould require many permanent sampling installations to integrate concentrations over48\n4\ntime.49\nAn attractive approach for mapping the long-term spatial distribution of elements50\nin APM is by biomonitoring. The underlying idea is to let plants accumulate atmo-51\nspheric depositions over time and then to analyse chemically the plant tissue. The52\nscope for exploiting plants in this way is diverse and includes plant leaves, lichens,53\nmosses and tree bark (Markert et al, 1993; Walkenhorst et al. 1993). The outer layer54\nof tree bark, in particular, has been found to be an effective passive accumulator of55\nairborne particles in both rural (Bohm et al., 1998) and urban (Tanaka and Ichikuni,56\n1982) environments. The particles in question settle on the outer bark by wet and57\ndry deposition, and they remain there until the tree sheds its bark, or are leached or58\nwashed away by rain, or a combination of the two.59\nSmooth-barked trees in the northern temperate zone begin to shed their bark60\nonly when mature (after about 50 years); trees with rougher bark tend to shed theirs61\nsomewhat earlier. The metal species deposited in the outer bark are separated physi-62\ncally from trace elements taken up in solution from the soil in the trees and their xylem63\nby a layer of phloem and cambium (Martin and Coughtrey, 1982). Further, extraneous64\ncontamination from the soil itself is limited to lowest 1.5 m of the trunk. So pollutants65\nin the bark above this height are almost entirely derived from the air (Wolterbeek and66\nBode, 1995).67\nDetermination of the metal contents of tree bark cannot lead to a direct as-68\nsessment of air quality because such measurements are retrospective and integrate as69\naverages over long times. Nevertheless, because trees are widespread in most towns70\nand cities, sampling their bark for subsequent chemical analysis and then noting pre-71\ncise locations mean that the elemental concentrations in the barks can be mapped.72\nSuch maps, whether simple displays of measured concentrations or ones made by more73\nelaborate interpolation could point to the emitter(s) of the metals, and identify regions74\nwhere much (and little) metal is deposited. To date there have been few published75\nattempts to map the distributions of metals from the analysis of tree bark. One was by76\n5\nLotschert and Kohm (1978) who drew isarithmic (\u2018contour\u2019) maps of Pb and Cd based77\non samples from 34 ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) throughout Frankfurt. A similar78\napproach, adopted by Bellis et al. (2001) to map airborne emissions in the vicinity of79\na lead smelter, was based on plotting data on the enrichment in Pb. On a national80\nscale Lippo et al. (1995) drew a \u2018pollution\u2019 map of Finland detailing anthropogenic81\nemissions for cities and industrial regions.82\nWe have investigated the potential of tree bark for mapping the accumulated83\ndeposition of airborne metals across metropolitan Sheffield, a city which has more trees84\nper unit of population than any other in Europe. We measured the concentrations of85\n18 metal and metalloid elements in bark at 642 locations in the region and compared86\nthem with those at a virtually uncontaminated site (Mace Head, western Ireland) to87\ndetermine the magnitude of contamination in the former. We collected bark samples88\nfrom three tree species to determine whether there were any substantial differences in89\nmetal contents between them. We did a principal component analysis on the elements90\nto establish the relationships between the elements and to discover whether there were91\nparticular groups of them that might behave differently from one another. We then92\nchose three potentially toxic elements, namely Cd, As and Ni, as representatives and93\nanalysed their data spatially (a) to determine regional trends, (b) to estimate their94\nspatial covariances, and (c) to interpolate and map their distributions by kriging. We95\nhave used these maps to identify likely local sources of atmospheric pollution. We96\ndiscuss the wider implications of our findings for the use of tree bark in environmental97\nmonitoring.98\n2. Materials and methods99\n2.1 Study region, tree bark survey and analysis.100\nSheffield has a long tradition of iron smelting and the production of steel. The invention101\nof the crucible process in 1740 sparked a massive expansion of the industry in the city,102\nrelying in part on coal from local mines, which continues to this day. This in turn led to103\n6\nsevere air pollution before measures to combat it were introduced under the Clean Air104\nAct of 1956. In 1963 the company British Steel opened a large works at Tinsley in the105\nnorth east of the city (Figure 1) to make special steels. Its production, including that106\nof stainless steel (ferrochrome), continues and emits significant quantities of Cr and Ni107\ninto the atmosphere. Gilbertson et al. (1997) reported on the long-term significance108\nof metal emissions from steel manufacturing from their study of concentrations of Co,109\nCu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn in a peat monolith from close to the works. They found110\nextraordinarily large concentrations (in mg kg\u22121) of Cu (472), Ni (320), Pb (827) and111\nZn (613) compared to concentrations in soil from an urban survey of the city for which112\nRawlins et al. (2005) presented data for Pb and Ni. The study of Gilbertson et al.113\nattributed the greatest enrichment of Cu and Zn in the uppermost layers to the works.114\nThe Environment Agency of the UK had compiled an inventory of pollution115\n(Environment Agency, 2003) in which it registered the locations and quantities of116\natmospheric particulate metal emissions from static sources. The inventory included117\nemissions exceeding the reporting thresholds of 100 g for Cd, 1 kg for As and 10 kg118\nfor Ni, each per year. It did not include sources of smaller amounts for which no119\ninformation is available on metal composition. We collated the data for the Sheffield120\nregion and to 3 km beyond its boundary for the years for which data were available121\nprior to our collection of the bark samples (1998\u20132002). We calculated the sum of122\nemissions for the five years so that they could be presented as total emission figures123\n(in kg) for each particular source.124\nBelow we discuss the significance of these sources in relation to the distributions125\nof the metals in bark.126\nIn establishing the region for our current study we wished to encompass the127\nmajor sources of metal emissions, including industry to the north and east of the City,128\nwhilst also estimating the spatial extent of metal deposition. We therefore surveyed129\nan area extending across the city from the suburbs of Whirlow and Greenhill south130\nand west of the centre and from which the prevailing wind blows (see wind rose inset131\n7\nin Figure 1) to industrial Brinsworth and Ecclesfield to the north-east of the city132\ncentre (see Figure 1). The number of people living in the region, estimated from133\nthe 1991 census, is approximately 271 500. This figure was calculated from the UK134\nEDINA database of population-weighted centroids defined for all the 1991 enumeration135\ndistricts (Bracken and Martin, 1989.). The total population of greater Sheffield is136\naround 550 000.137\nSamples of bark were collected from 642 trees of the three species (with pro-138\nportions of each shown in parentheses): sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus \u2014 68%), oak139\n(Quercus robur \u2014 22%) and cherry (Prunus serrula \u2014 10%); their locations are shown140\nin Figure 1. Both sycamore and cherry have fairly smooth bark, whereas the bark of141\noak is rougher. The samples were collected between April and November, 2003. In142\na series of local neighbourhoods, trees belonging to the three species occurring in a143\npublic space were identified. From these a subset was sampled to provide, as far as144\npossible, an even spatial distribution.145\nApproximately 10 g of the external outer bark (1\u20132 mm depth) was removed from146\neach target tree with a clean scraping tool at 1.5 m above the ground. Sample sites147\nspanned an altitude range of 271 m, from 33 to 301 m above mean sea level. The mean148\naltitude was 106 m.149\nTrees in the temperate zone of the UK enlarge their diameters by approximately150\n1 cm per year, so a tree\u2019s circumference in cm divided by pi gives an approximate age151\nof the tree (P. Casey, personal communication). The ages of the trees from which bark152\nwas sampled ranged from 25 to 45 years (circumferences of 78 to 141 cm). Bark with153\nmoss, lichen or paint was excluded from the sample. The orientation of the location for154\nsampling was random. The samplers wore polythene gloves to avoid contaminating the155\nsamples, which were stored in sealed brown paper envelopes at 4 \u25e6C. The geographic156\nco-ordinates and altitude of each site were obtained by GPS (Garmin International,157\nInc., USA). A further nine bark samples were collected from sycamore trees at Mace158\nHead on the west coast of Ireland (53\u25e6 20\u2019 N, 9\u25e6 54\u2019 W) so that we could estimate159\n8\nbackground concentrations where there is negligible pollution.160\nEach bark sample was crushed into a fine powder in a Tema mill. The bark161\npowder was then passed through a sieve (0.5 mm mesh) to remove any large lumps.162\nThereafter all the equipment was cleaned thoroughly to prevent cross-contamination of163\nthe following sample. Tree bark powder (4.0 g) was thoroughly mixed with polystyrene164\nco-polymer binder (0.9 g) (Hoechst Wax, Spectro Analytical, UK) and pressed for 1165\nminute to produce powder pellets. The powder pellets were analysed by EDXRF166\nspectrometry (X-LAB, Spectro Analytical, UK). The instrument was calibrated for 18167\nelements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Ti, V, Zn) for168\na wide range of standard biological reference materials which included poplar leaves,169\nlichen, human hair and tea leaves. Typical analytical performance has been published170\npreviously (Schelle et al., 2002). The concentrations of Cd were less than the detection171\nlimit for 19% of the samples, and so we set their values to half that limit for subsequent172\nstatistical analysis. Fifty two percent of the samples contained less than the detection173\nlimit of Ag, and so we do not consider it further.174\n2.2 Summary statistics175\nTable 1 summarizes the data for all 17 elements. The distribution of most was posi-176\ntively skewed, some strongly, and so to stabilize variances for subsequent analyses we177\ntransformed the values to logarithms. The table lists the transformations we made.178\nAs expected, there is a huge range in the mean values. Aluminium, which is the179\nmost abundant metal in the rocks and soil, is most abundant in the bark also. Iron180\nappears in large amounts, and given Sheffield\u2019s history we might expect such results181\ntoo. The concentrations of the other elements do not immediately stand out. With the182\nexception of Al, the mean concentrations in Sheffield were much larger than those those183\nat Mace Head (Table 2); for Cr, Mn, Ni and Ti they were an order of magnitude larger.184\nAnthropogenic sources are almost certainly the reason for the greater concentrations185\nof metal in the tree bark in Sheffield.186\nWhat is highly significant is that the distributions of all the elements are strongly187\n9\npositively skewed, with skewness coefficients ranging from 1.7 to almost 10. We found188\nthat all could be described well by a three-parameter log-normal distribution, which189\nhas the probability density function:190\ng(z) =\n1\n\u03c3(z \u2212 \u03b1)\u221a2pi exp\n[\n\u2212 1\n2\u03c32\n{ln(z \u2212 \u03b1)\u2212 \u00b5}2\n]\n, (1)\nwhere z is the variable of interest, \u00b5 and \u03c3 are the mean and standard deviation191\nof the transformed variable, and \u03b1 is the shift in the original scale to maximize the192\ngoodness of fit. The shift and the mean and standard deviations in natural logarithms193\nare listed in Table 1. In the final column of Table 1 are the skewness coefficients194\nof the logarithms from which it is evident that the transformations have made the195\ndistributions symmetric. This is important for stabilizing the variances, and we have196\ndone all our further analyses on these transformed scales.197\nAnalysis of variance revealed little differences among species; they accounted for198\nless than 5% of the variance for any of 16 metals and for only 8.5% for As. We have199\ntherefore disregarded differences between species in our subsequent multivariate and200\nspatial analysis.201\n2.3 Selection of variables; principal component analysis.202\nFor the purpose of this paper we wanted to select a few elements from the 17 listed203\nabove that would illustrate both the feasibility of analysing APM in bark and mapping204\nthe distribution of elements in it and produce maps interesting in their own right.205\nTo help in the selection we did a principal component analysis on the correlation206\nmatrix of the logarithms. We hoped thereby to see any clusters of strongly correlated207\nelements from which we could choose representatives and any other elements that were208\nclearly uncorrelated with others and should be treated in their own right. Table 3 lists209\nthe leading eigenvalues of the correlation matrix. The first component accounts for210\nalmost half the variance, and second and third together account for more than half211\nthe remainder. Pursuing the analysis, we computed the correlation coefficients, rij,212\n10\nbetween the principal component scores and the (logarithms of the) original variables213\nas214\nrij = \u03bdij\n\u221a\n\u03bbj\/\u03c32i , (2)\nwhere \u03bdij is the ith entry in the jth eigenvector, \u03bbj is the jth eigenvalue, and \u03c3\n2\ni is the215\nvariance of the ith original variable. We then plotted the results in the unit circles for216\npairs of the leading components. We show two such circles in Figure 2 in which we217\nhave plotted the correlation coefficients (a) for component 2 against component 1 and218\n(b) for component 3 against component 1. In general, the closer the points lie to the219\ncircumference of one of these circles the better are they represented in that projection.220\nWe note first that all of the plotted points fall in the right hand halves of the221\ngraphs: component 1 is essentially one of size. Component 2 discriminates, separating222\nthe siderophile (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) and lithophile (Cr and V) elements from the calcophile223\ngroup (Pb and Zn) and their associates. Arsenic appears nearest the centre in circle224\n(a) and the least correlated with the other elements. This is confirmed in circle (b)225\nin which the point for As lies close to the circumference and away from the other226\nelements. Somewhat surprisingly Zn lies near the bottom of axis 3. The siderophiles227\nremain clustered in this projection.228\nFrom this examination of the data we have chosen three elements for our spatial229\nanalysis. We have chosen Ni as representative of the siderophiles and because it is a230\nkey element in steel production. We chose Cd because of its potential toxicity and231\nagain used in manufacturing. Third, we chose As, another poison, but from Figure232\n2(b) clearly dissociated from the other elements.233\n2.4 Spatial modelling by REML234\nOur objective is to display the spatial variation of the three selected elements on235\ntree bark across Sheffield as isarithmic (\u2018contour\u2019) maps having first estimated the236\nconcentrations at the nodes of a fine grid. We used kriging for the estimation, following237\nclosely the technique we used to map the distribution of metals emitted from a smelter238\n11\nand described recently in this Journal (Rawlins et al., 2006).239\nOrdinary kriging is based on two assumptions.240\n1. A variable of interest, y, at locations xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , is a realization of an241\nintrinsically stationary correlated random function Y (x) such that242\nE [Y (x)\u2212 Y (x+ h)] = 0 for all x, h , (3)\nwhere E [\u00b7] denotes the statistical expectation of the term in brackets, and h is a243\nlag vector, a displacement in space from the location x.244\n2. The expected squared difference between Y (x) and Y (x+ h) depends only on h:245\nE\n[\n{Y (x)\u2212 Y (x+ h)}2\n]\n= 2\u03b3(h) . (4)\nThe quantity \u03b3(h) is the variance perpoint at lag h and as a function of h is the246\nvariogram.247\nA preliminary display of the data for Ni and Cd at least suggested that the248\nassumption in Equation (3) was not tenable; there were evident trends from small249\nconcentrations far from the steel works in the south west of the city to large ones close250\nto the works in the north east, as we expected. This situation requires more complex251\ngeostatistical analysis in which the trend is separated from the random component252\nand the estimates are made by universal kriging (Matheron, 1969), or \u2018kriging with253\ntrend\u2019 as it is now more generally known. Saito and Goovaerts (2001) encountered254\na similar problem in a study on the distribution of metal pollutants in two urban255\nareas in the United States. In each case there were clear trends in the distribution256\nof these contaminants, which could be accounted for by the wind direction and the257\nlocation of sources (one smelter in one of the areas, and two adjacent smelters in the258\nsecond). They used this information to produce simple trend models, based on physical259\nprinciples, which predict the amount of metal that has been deposited from the sources260\nat any location. This constituted the trend in their universal kriging. In order to model261\nthe spatial dependence of the random component, the residual from the trend, they262\n12\nestimated variograms of the pollutant from paired comparisons between sites at which263\nthe trend was deemed to be similar. This crudely filters the trend from the variogram264\nthat is obtained. It also discards the information about the random component of265\nvariation that could be obtained from comparisons between points where the trend is266\nvery different. To do this requires a more sophisticated analysis.267\nRecent developments in numerical analysis linked to modern computing power268\nenable us to use Residual Maximum Likelihood (reml) for the purpose, and we must269\nnow regard this as best practice. We described the procedure fully in Rawlins et al.270\n(2006), and we shall not repeat the detail here. In this respect, then, our analysis271\nwas more sophisticated than that of Saito and Goovaerts (2001). In another respect272\nit was more primitive, because we did not attempt to use a physically-based model273\nfor the trend in metal content of the bark. This was because, by contrast to the two274\nregions studied by Saito and Goovaerts (2001), Sheffield has multiple sources of metal275\npollutants, and not only current or recent ones, but also many others from the distant276\npast about which we have no detailed information. For our trend models therefore we277\nconsidered only simple functions of the spatial coordinates.278\nWe treat the transformed data as the outcome from a mixed model:279\nY (x) =\nK\u2211\nk=0\n\u03b2kfk(x) + \u03b5(x) . (5)\nIt consists of K + 1 fixed effects (which explain the trend in terms of known functions280\nof the spatial co-ordinates) and a spatially dependent random variable \u03b5(x) with mean281\nzero and variogram \u03b3(h). In order to apply reml to estimate the variance of the282\nrandom variable and its spatial dependence we make stronger assumptions of station-283\narity than the intrinsic hypothesis stated in Equations (3) and (4) above. We require284\nthat the random variable is second-order stationary, which means that the variogram285\nis bounded by the a priori variance of the process. This is not a serious constraint in286\npractice once we have separated out the fixed effects, and is met by most of the popular287\nvariogram models used in geostatistics. Our task is to estimate the contributions of288\nthe fixed and random components simultaneously, minimizing the estimation variance.289\n13\nThe separate contributions need not be explicitly computed when we use universal290\nkriging, but they should be inspected to assess the weight of evidence for a trend in291\nthe variable.292\nWe first chose a few plausible models for the trend in Equation (5) by inspection293\nof the data. We then separated these trends from the data and computed experimental294\nvariograms of the residuals by the usual method of moments:295\n\u03b3\u0302(h) =\n1\n2m(h)\nm(h)\u2211\nj=1\n{y(xj)\u2212 y(xj + h)}2 , (6)\nwhere y(xj) and y(xj+h) are the values of y at sampling points xj and xj+h separated296\nby the lag h andm(h) is the number of paired comparisons at that lag. We fitted several297\nof the standard simple models to these variograms by weighted least squares and chose298\nthe ones that fitted best in the least squares sense.299\nThis estimation of the trend ignores the spatial correlation of the residuals, but300\nis acceptable for exploratory purposes. We found that we could describe the trend in301\nthe transformed data simply by the distance from a reference site in the north-east of302\nthe region, so that our full model for the variation was303\nY (x) = \u03b20 + \u03b21||x\u2212 xR||+ \u03b5(x) , (7)\nwhere || \u00b7 || denotes the Euclidean norm of the enclosed vector. The vector xR is304\nthe reference site close to the steel works in the north-east of the region with British305\nNational Grid co-ordinates (441945.8, 390339.4). We chose this model in preference to306\na more conventional linear function of the co-ordinates because it achieved at least as307\ngood an ordinary least-squares fit to the data with one fewer terms.308\nWe then computed the experimental variograms of the ordinary least-squares309\nresiduals and found that an isotropic exponential model with nugget gave a satisfactory310\nfit. Its equation is311\n\u03b3(h) = c0 + c\n{\n1\u2212 exp\n(\n\u2212h\na\n)}\n, (8)\nin which c0 is the nugget variance, c is the sill of the correlated variance, a is a distance312\nparameter and h = ||h|| is now a scalar in distance only. This model, which is widely313\n14\nused in geostatistics, increases asymptotically to its maximum, with an effective range314\nof 3\u00d7 a.315\nWe then used the ASreml program (Gilmour et al., 2002) to fit the model in316\nEquation (7) to each variable. We specified an exponential correlation function, which317\ncorresponds to the exponential variogram in Equation (8). The program provides reml318\nestimates of the parameters c0, c and a, and generalized least-squares estimates of the319\nfixed effects. We tested the null hypothesis that the true value of the fixed effect for the320\ntrend, \u03b21, is zero by computing the Wald statistic. This statistic is equivalent to the321\nvariance ratio for the predictor in an analysis of variance for an ordinary least-squares322\nregression. However, we used the method of Kenward and Roger (1997) to compute an323\nadjusted Wald statistic, and adjusted degrees of freedom in the denominator for the F324\ntest to allow for the spatial dependence of the residuals.325\n2.5 Lognormal universal kriging326\nFor reasons described above we transformed the raw data, z(x), to approximately327\nnormally distributed variables, which we have denoted by y(x). These values were328\nused to obtain predictions at points on a fine grid over the region by universal kriging.329\nThe universal kriging (UK) uses the specified fixed effects in the prediction and the330\ncovariance parameters estimated by reml. Note that for arsenic, for which the trend331\nwas effectively constant, the universal kriging predictions are the same as those from332\nordinary kriging since we estimate one fixed effect, \u03b20, which is the mean.333\nUniversal kriging returns an estimate of the transformed random variable Y (x);334\nbut we require estimates on the scale of the original data z(x). As with any estimate335\nderived from log-transformed data, we cannot simply back transform the estimates on336\nthe logarithmic scale; we must also correct for bias. Cressie (2006) has shown that the337\nUK estimate of a log-normal variable Z\u02dc \u2032(x0), based on the UK estimate Y\u02dc (x0) of the338\ncorresponding Y , is339\nZ\u02dc \u2032(x0) = exp\n{\nY\u02dc (x0) +\n1\n2\n\u03c32UK \u2212 \u03c80 \u2212\nK\u2211\ni=1\n\u03c8ifi(x0)\n}\n, (9)\n15\nwhere the \u03c80, \u03c81, . . . are Lagrange parameters from the UK system (see Rawlins et al.,340\n2006). We therefore back-transformed our kriged estimates in this way.341\nWe kriged the log-transformed variables at the nodes of a 200-m square grid.342\nFor each variable we specified the fixed effects selected after the reml analysis, and343\nthe covariance parameters obtained from that analysis. All observations were used344\nfor kriging at all target sites because we wanted the trend model at all target sites345\nto be the same as the overall trend model to which our variogram refers. Since the346\nnumber of data is large, this could lead to difficulties with the inversion of a large347\nmatrix. Our program for obtaining the lognormal UK estimates uses a subroutine348\nfor matrix inversion (LINRG, from IMSL, Visual Numerics, 1997) that reports any349\nconditioning problems. It did not do so. We then used Equation (9) to transform350\nthe estimates back to the original scale, and corrected for the shift constant, \u03b1, in351\nthe original log-transformation. A particular advantage of kriging, relative to other352\nmethods for spatial prediction such as arbitrarily weighted local averaging, is that353\nthe error variances of the predictions are minimized and also (generally) is known.354\nUnfortunately, back-transformations of the variances in the logarithms to the original355\nscale can be calculated only for the simple kriging case (Webster and Oliver, 2007).356\nNevertheless, because we know the prediction variances on the transformed scale we357\ncan compute confidence limits and transform them. This therefore is what we did; we358\ncomputed the local 95% upper limits in the logarithms and transformed them to the359\noriginal scale of measurement.360\n3. Results and their interpretation361\n3.1 Trend and variance models based on REML362\nAs above, we analysed the data for the three elements Ni, Cd and As. Their histograms363\nappear in the top row of Figure 3 and are evidently strongly positively skewed. The364\nmiddle row of histograms in the figure are of their logarithms; the transformation has365\nconferred symmetry (see also Table 1) and left no outliers. Finally, in the bottom row366\n16\nof the figure are the histograms of the residuals of the transformed data of Ni and Cd367\nfrom their trends. Again the residuals for Ni and Cd are symmetrically distributed with368\nsmall coefficients of skewness (-0.17 and 0.03 respectively). This gives us confidence369\nthat the assumption of normality of the random process, implicit in our use of reml for370\nestimation of the variance model, is plausible. They show that, under the logarithmic371\ntransform, our data contain no obvious marginal outliers that might distort the variance372\nmodel or local estimates. Finally, they show that the residual variation has been373\ndiminished\u2014the standard deviation of the residuals of Ni is 0.794 compared with 1.202374\nin the logarithms and that of Cd is 0.796 compared with 1.091.375\nThe trend models fitted for each element, after log-transformation, are listed376\nin Table 4. Note that for both nickel and cadmium the estimated coefficient \u03b21 is377\nnegative, and that the null hypothesis that there is no trend can be rejected decisively378\nbecause of the very small value of P in the Wald test. The negative coefficient implies379\nthat the larger concentrations of metals are near the reference site in the north-east380\nof the region. All the registered sources of Ni and Cd emissions occur in the north-381\neast of the region also. The source with the largest emission of Ni (having emitted382\na total of 10 800 kg from 1998 to 2002) by almost one order of magnitude is 2.6 km383\nto the west of the reference site (Figure 4a). The same emitter was also the largest384\nsource of Cd (having emitted 227 kg over the same period; Figure 4b). When the385\nwind blows from the north and east these metals are dispersed towards the south and386\nwest, accounting for the observed trend. We do not observe the same degree of trend387\nin the pattern to the north and east because when the wind blows from the south388\nand west \u2014 the dominant prevailaing direction \u2014 significant quantities of metals are389\ndeposited towards the northern and eastern boundaries of the study region, where the390\nconcentrations remain substantially greater than the near background values observed391\nelsewhere.392\nThe analysis reveals that the random effect for both Cd and Ni has marked393\nspatial dependence; more than half of their variances is spatially correlated to distances394\n17\nbetween 2 and 2.5 km. This suggests that there are factors causing this variation395\nunexplained by the trend model and that it might be worth attempting to identify396\nthem. The largest concentrations of Ni and Cd occur close to their dominant sources,397\naccounting for the spatial dependence at short distances (Figure 4a and b).398\nIn contrast, there was no evident spatial trend in the concentrations of arsenic,399\nwhich is confirmed in the formal Wald test of the null hypothesis that \u03b21 is zero. For400\nthis reason we computed a variance model for log-transformed arsenic with only one401\nfixed effect, namely the mean. The variogram parameters for this model were used for402\nthe kriging prediction. Note that little more than a fifth of the variance is spatially403\ncorrelated, and that to distances of approximately only 1.5 km.404\n3.2 Maps of metal concentration in bark.405\nFigure 4a shows much short-range variation of Ni in the north-east of the region, which406\nwe presume to result from emissions and deposition from both current steel works and407\nones now defunct over many years. This pattern and the mechanism accord with what408\nwe know of total soil Ni concentrations across the city from a recent geochemical survey409\n(Rawlins et al., 2005). The Ni is most concentrated immediately to the west of the big410\nsteel works at Tinsley (440 km east, 390 km north; Figure 4a). Another smaller source411\n(437 km east, 389 km north) might account for the large concentrations (400 mg kg\u22121)412\nin its vicinity and to the north and east in the direction of the prevailing wind. There413\nare two small areas with large Ni values (440 km east, 388 km north; 438 km east,414\n387.5 km north) which, according to our database, do not have significant sources415\nnearby. Nevertheless, there are within 500 m of these two locations industries that416\nmight emit Ni-bearing particles. Concentrations of Ni are generally small in the north417\nand south-west the region where there are no recorded sources of pollution. This418\nsuggests that there is little long-range dispersal, resuspension and deposition of the419\nmetal.420\nLet us now turn to Cd. Figure 4b shows the largest concentrations around two421\nsources (437 km east, 388 km north), one where metal is produced and processed422\n18\n(having emitted a total of 69 kg from 1998 to 2002), the other an incinerator (having423\nemitted 52 kg over the same period). Somewhat surprisingly, the concentrations are424\nsmaller near to the source of the largest emission (total emission 227 kg from 1998 to425\n2002). As with Ni, the concentrations of Cd diminish rapidly within 500 m of these426\nsources, with the larger values extending northeastwards. The spatial patterns of Cd427\nconcentrations alone do not appear to reflect the magnitude of local sources, but the428\ntemporally varying dispersal mechanisms which depend on the strength and direction429\nof the wind and the height of the emissions. A single spatial outlier with a large430\nconcentration of Cd (21.1 mg kg\u22121) occurs to the south-west of the region (432 km431\neast, 384 km north) in an entirely residential area, and we cannot explain it.432\nThe spatial distribution of arsenic (As) is considerably more complex than that433\nof Ni and Cd. The largest As concentrations do not occur around the steelworks at434\nTinsley \u2014 the largest static emitter (Figure 4c) \u2014 but where there are no registered435\nemissions of As (438 km east, 390 km north). This part of the region contains a mixture436\nof residential housing, industry and recreation grounds. Fugitive emissions from the437\nindustrial sites could acccount for some of the arsenic. The concentrations diminish438\nrapidly in their immediate vicinity, but more slowly at greater distances. A similar439\npattern is observed around another area of large concentrations (434 km east, 385 km440\nnorth), where once again there are no registered sources of emissions and land use is441\ndominantly residential. Arsenic is richer in coal from Sheffield (Yorkshire) than in coal442\nfrom most other parts of Great Britain. From an analysis of 24 samples of coal from443\nacross the country, those from the two Yorkshire seams had As concentrations of 8.7444\nand 37 mg kg\u22121, which equate to the 65th and 97th percentile of the As distribution445\n(Spears and Zheng, 1999). Coal was mined and burnt in the City for at least 200 years446\nbefore the last coal mine was closed and the Clean Air acts were implemented in the447\n1960s. There would have been many local emitters of As, and the APM from those448\ndays might still be being resuspended and redistributed.449\n4. Discussion450\n19\nThe substantially larger mean concentrations of metals in tree bark across Sheffield451\nthan those at Mace Head indicate that most of the metal in Sheffield is of anthro-452\npogenic origin. We have also shown that differences between tree species, and any453\ndifferences in the roughness of their bark, are unlikely to be significant in determining454\nthe concentrations of most metals. It should therefore be possible to use tree bark455\nfrom other species in similar environmental biomonitoring studies without introducing456\nsignificant error. This is likely to be advantageous where trees of any one species are457\nsparse.458\nThe concentrations of Ni and Cd in the bark of trees in Sheffield show that aerial459\ndeposition of metal, and any subsequent resuspension, diminishes markedly within460\n500 metres of the emitters, though there appears to be significant dispersal over sev-461\neral kilometres. This strengthens the case for biomonitoring of long-term atmospheric462\npollution via the analysis of tree bark in a cost-effective way and for identifying where463\nthe sources of pollution are.464\nThe marked autocorrelation observed in the spatial distributions of Cd and Ni465\n(and also Cr, Co and Cu which we have not described here) indicates that measure-466\nments of metals in tree bark in industrial environments can be used to map long-term467\ndeposition of those metals from the atmosphere. By contrast, elements such as lead468\nwith widespread and even mobile sources, as from motor vehicles before lead was for-469\nbidden in fuel in the year 2000, are not spatially correlated; their variograms are wholly470\nnugget at the working scale and so interpolation by any means should not be attempted.471\nThe method we describe and have applied is entirely statistical, though underlain472\nby general knowledge and understanding. We did not attempt to use a source-oriented473\nchemical transport model. We recognize that incorporation of such a model could im-474\nprove spatial predictions and aid our interpretation of the spatial patterns observed.475\nThat is the next logical step in our investigation of these data, and we plan to incorpo-476\nrate such in formation into the linear mixed model that we have used here (see Stacey477\net al., 2007).478\n20\nAcknowledgements479\nThis paper is published with the permission of the Director of the British Geologi-480\ncal Survey (Natural Environment Research Council).
