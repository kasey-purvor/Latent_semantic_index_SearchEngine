Introduction\nLet Q be a complete and separable metric space, and \\x a a-finite Radon measure on Q.\nLet E be a closed linear subspace of the Lebesgue space Lp(f2;\/j,), where 1 < p < oo.\nSuppose that L is a closed and densely defined linear operator in E; for convenience we\nwill take its null space to be zero. We are concerned with the abstract Cauchy problem\niwt = Lw, w(x,0) = f(x), (1.1)\nwhich has a unique solution for initial data \/ G E, in the sense of Hille and Phillips [13,\np. 622], whenever {-\\L) is the generator of a Co-semigroup of bounded linear operators\non E. It is of interest to determine when the solution satisfies w(x, t) -t f(x) \/^-almost\neverywhere as t -* 0. This involves imposing extra conditions on \/ in order to control\nthe maximal function supt>0 |w(x,t)|, as in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. Let A = - Y?j=i dlj oe tne Laplace operator in Lp(Md), and let 2 <\na < 3 and max.{p,p\/(p - 1)} < 12d\/(6d + 3 - 2a).\n(i) Then there is a uniformly bounded family of linear operators on Lp(K'i)\n_ r\n< t 0 ) ( 1 2 )\n57\n58 G. Blower\nfor which the maximal function\nf >-> sup \\m{tl'z>\/A)\/| (\/ \u20ac V) (1.3)\ndefines a strongly bounded sublinear operator Lp(Rd) \u2014> LP(Kd).\n(ii) farther, the solution w of (1.1) with L = A3\/2 satisfies w{x,t) -\u00bb \/(x) almost\neverywhere as t \u2014> 0+, when f E Lp is in the domain of Aa\/2.\nThe method of proof is based upon a device of Cowling [10, Theorem 6]. For suitable\nm, we can take the Fourier transform of h(x) = m(ex) and write\nm(tL)f = f hW&LKf d\u00a3\/27r ( f e E , t > 0 ) (1.4)\nfor the multiplier operator m(tL). We will usually take m(tL) to be defined by this\nformula, whenever the right-hand side is a convergent Bochner-Lebesgue integral. The\noperators to which we apply our results have a rich functional calculus which is essentially\nunique, so this mode of definition may be adopted without ambiguity.\nIn \u00a73 I prove Theorem 1.1, and the result on the Schrodinger group stated in the\nabstract, by showing that the right-hand side of (1.4) is suitably convergent. The key\nstep, which suggests the subsequent generalizations, is to use the Marcinkiewicz multiplier\ntheorem to control the group L1^ of imaginary powers of L = VK. In cases of interest\ninvolving Lp (1 < p < oo, p ^ 2), the operator group U^ is locally but not uniformly\nbounded.\nIn \u00a7 4 we extend the method for application to the generators (iL) of bounded Co-\ngroups eltL of operators on subspaces E of Lp(f2; y). In order to achieve bounds on (1.4),\nwe use the functional calculus for spectral integration, as developed in [1-3]. In \u00a72 we\ndescribe the class of g-Marcinkiewicz multipliers of [2,9,11,20] which include the classical\nMarcinkiewicz multipliers. We then transfer bounds on the mulipliers into bounds on the\noperators m{L).\nIn \u00a7 5 we use similar techniques to deal with almost everywhere convergence of solutions\nof an abstract wave equation. See [8] for an introduction to cosine families and hyperbolic\nequations. The technique works for functions with values in a suitable Banach space,\nprecisely a UMD Banach space. Throughout the paper we use transference techniques for\nCo-groups of operators, as in [3,4], rather than analytic semigroups as in [10, Theorem 1].\nNotation. The Bochner-Lebesgue space of strongly measurable functions \/ : R \u2014> E\nwith ||\/(\u00a3)HB integrable is denoted V(R;E) [13, p. 79]. When W : D>(R) -4 L\"(R) is\na bounded linear operator, it has a natural extension W <g> \/ : LP(R) <g> E \u2014> L^R) \u00ae E\nwhich, under favourable circumstances, extends to define a bounded linear operator on\nL^R; E); we then write W for this extension. We denote by (en) the Rademacher random\nvariables, and by E\u00a3 the expectation with respect to their usual probability measure.\nMaximal functions and transference for groups of operators 59\n2. q-variation and multipliers\nDefinition. Let Afc = [2fc,2fc+1) and Afc = (-2f c + 1 , -2*] for k e Z be the intervals\ndefining the standard dyadic decomposition of R. For any bounded interval \/ , 1 ^ q < oo\nand complex-valued function H, the q-variation of H over I is defined to be the supremum\nover all finite partitions:\nKJV-1 . l\/g s\n] T \\H(tj+1) - H(tj)\\\" 1 \\tjeI;t1<t2<---<tNy (2.1)\nj=i ' '\nWhen q = 1 this gives the usual notion of variation, as in the classical Marcinkiewicz mul-\ntiplier theorem [16, Theorem 6]. The Marcinkiewicz q-multipliers of R are the functions\nH for which the norm\n| |#I |M\u00ab(3) = sup \\H(t)\\ + supvarg(#; Afc) + supvar , (# ; Afc) (2.2)\ntes fcez fcez\nis finite. The space M9(R) thus formed is a Banach algebra under pointwise multiplication\nof functions. In [9] it is shown that q-multipliers do indeed give bounded Fourier multi-\npliers on suitable IP spaces. Further, MX(R) includes all functions of bounded variation\no n l .\nLet L be a closed and densely defined operator in a Banach space E with zero null\nspace, and suppose that the imaginary powers Uu (u e R) form a Co-group of operators\non E. (In the cases of interest, the powers may be defined by functional calculus, see\n(4.2) below.) As in [4], we define the modular function of this group to be\nTE{U) = sup{ | |L i s | | E ^ E | \\s\\ < |\u00ab|} (u 6 R). (2.3)\nBy an application of the uniform boundedness theorem, given in [13, p. 306], the function\nTB{U) is at most of exponential growth in |u|.\nProposition 2.1. Let m(A) (A > 0) be a function with h(x) = m(ex) integrable, and\nlet h(\u00a3) be the Fourier transform. Let E be a closed linear subspace of V{Q; n) for some\n1 < p < oo, and let q with 1 ^ q < oo have | l \/2 \u2014 l \/p | < 1\/q.\n(i) Then m(L), defined as in (1.4), has operator norm\n| |m(L) | |E->E ^ Cp 2__, T e ( 2 ) (\\\\h * V'fcllr\/^ca) + ll^ 1 * ^fe||:\/:\u00ab(3))> (2-4)\nfc=-oo\nwhere\n, . . sin2fc-1a;exp(i3-2fe-1x)\n1>k{x) = (x 6 K);\nnx\nso that m(L) is a bounded linear operator, whenever this series converges.\n60 G. Blower\n(ii) Suppose further that U^ is a bounded Co-group of operators, so that the modular\nfunction is bounded byr. Then \\\\m(L)\\\\E->E ^ C(p,g)r2||\/i||M,(R).\nProof, (i) Let us suppose that the series in (2.4) converges. By the Fourier inversion\ntheorem we can write\nm(A) = J T f + f A*\/i(0 d\u00a3\/27r (A > 0), (2.5)\nso that, at least formally, the multiplier operator is\nm(L)f= JT [ +[ h{i)L*fti-l2* (feE). (2.6)\nk=-oo'\nOur task is to show that the right-hand side is norm convergent; this we do by considering\na typical summand. The operator\nHk:f-* I h(0L^fd^\/2n (\/ e E) (2.7)\nJAk\nis certainly well defined, since h is integrable over Afe and ^ \u2014> L'^f is norm continuous.\nBy the transference theorem for Co-groups [4, Theorem 2.1], the operator norm of Hk is\n^ 21\/pr|(2':+1)||yl(Afc)||, where ||yl(^fc)|| is the operator norm of the convolution operator\n[ (geL?(R;E)) (2.8)\nAk\non the Bochner\u2014Lebesgue space LP(K; E). By Fubini's Theorem, this is just the norm of\nA(hk) acting on the scalar-valued function space LP(R); and by the multiplier theorem 1\nof [9], this is < CPtq\\\\h * ipk\\\\Mi(R)- Summing up these estimates over k we obtain the\nstated result.\n(ii) This is a special case of [2, Theorem 1.2]. \u2022\nProposition 2.2. Let E and L be as in Proposition 2.1(i). Suppose further that\nT\u00a3;(\u00a3)ft(\u00a3) is integrable. Then the Bochner integrals\nm{tL)f=f h(Z)t*L*f &Z\/2-K (f\u00a3E,t>0) (2.9)\nJ \u2014 oo\ndefine a uniformly bounded family of linear operators m(tL) on E for which the maximal\nfunction\nf >-> sup \\m(tL)f\\ (\/ \u20ac E) (2.10)\ndefines a strongly bounded sublinear operator E \u2014t IPifl; [i).\nMaximal functions and transference for groups of operators 61\nProof. Since \u00a3 >-\u00bb L'^f 6 E is norm-continuous and each image is bounded by\nIli'^IU-yEll\/llfi! the expression (2.9) is a well-defined Bochner-Lebesgue integral. By [13,\nTheorem 3.8.2] the integral defines a bounded linear operator m(tL), and the following\ncomputation will additionally achieve a uniform bound on the operator norms.\nTo estimate the maximal function we take the supremum norm in the f-variable, and\nthen the !\/(\/?; \/i) norm, to obtain\n\/ |fc(O|||L\u00ab\/||Bd\u00a3\/27r (\/ G E); (2.11)\nJ-oo\n| | |\nt>0\nand by considering the triangle inequality for integrals we see this is\nI\"\nJ \u2014\n(\/ G E). (2.12)\nBy the assumptions on h and the modular function, the latest integral is finite. D\n3. Maximal functions for Schrodinger and KdV groups\nLet A be the operator - Ylj=i &x m L2(Rd,dx). This defines an essentially self-adjoint\nand positive operator in C\u00a3\u00b0(Rd); and we can use the spectral theorem to form functions\nof A, in particular, we form the square root \\fK ^ 0. One can extend suitably bounded\noperators, defined initially on I? D LP, to Lp for 1 < p < oo [8, p. 412].\nLemma 3.1. Let 0 < \/? < d and max{p,p\/(p - 1)} < 2d\/(d - j3). Then there is\nC(p, (3) < oo such that the modular function TP of the group of imaginary powers Am on\nLp(Ed) satisfies\nTP(U) ^ C(p, 0){1 + \\uf) (u 6 R). (3.1)\nProof. We may suppose that 2 < p < oo, for the other cases follow by duality. We\nset 6 = 1 - p\/d, so that there exists q with p < q < oo for which 1\/p = 9\/2 + (1 \u2014 0)\/q;\nthis exploits the assumptions on 0 and p.\nThe operator Am corresponds to the Fourier multiplier (J2J=i \u00a3j)'U\/'2- By the Marcin-\nkiewicz multiplier theorem [16, Theorem 6'], A1U defines a Co-group of operators on\nLq(md) with\nIIAiuIU\u00ab(*<)-n,\u00ab(K\u00ab\u00ab) ^ C(q, d)(l + \\u\\)d (u G R); (3.2)\nand by the Plancherel formula\ni\n = 1 (u G R). (3.3)\nWe interpolate between the estimates (3.3) and (3.2) using the Riesz-Thorin Theorem\n[21, p. 95] to achieve the desired bound (3.1). D\n62 G. Blower\nIn the course of the proofs of Theorems 3.3 and 1.1, we require to estimate various\noscillatory integrals. The basic technique may be summarized in the following variant of\nvan der Corput's Lemma from [18, p. 334].\nLemma 3.2. Suppose that the phase function <j> is real-valued and smooth on (a, b)\nand that \\4>w(\\)\\ ^ 1 for all A \u20ac (a, 6), where either\n(i) k ^ 2; or\n(ii) k = I, and <j)'{\\) is monotonic.\nThen there is Cfc, independent of 4> &nd s, with\nf ei f |V' (s > 0).\nThe following result was stated in the abstract. The group of operators eltA involved is\nused to solve the Cauchy problem for the Schrodinger equation in free Euclidean space.\nTheorem 3.3. For 1 < S < 2 and 4d\/{2d + 6 - 1) < q < 4d\/(2d +1-6), the maximal\nfunction\nf sup\nt>0\neitA - \/ (\/ e L2 n L\") (3.4)\ndefines a strongly bounded sublinear operator Lq(Rd) \u2014> L9(Md).\nProof. We begin by making a Fourier transform representation of h{x) = m(ex),\nwhere m is the multiplier\nm(A) = \u2014g\u2014 (A > 0).\nThe maximal function involves a scaling of m. We calculate\n\/\noo\nh(x)e-ix\n_ i\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\nwhere we have introduced the variable A = ex; the latest integral is absolutely convergent\nwhen 0 < 6 < 2. Consequently, h(\u00a3) is bounded near to \u00a3 = 0; by considering large \u00a3,\nwe shall show \/\u00bb(\u00a3)rp(\u00a3) \u20ac L^. Integration by parts gives us, since the integrated term\nvanishes, the expression\nMaximal functions and transference for groups of operators 63\nwhich invites the method of stationary phase.

By repeated integration by parts, one can show that the contribution to\n(3.6) arising from f* decays fast enough as \u00a3 -> -oo; see (3.15) below for a more delicate\ncase.

The result follows\nfrom Proposition 2.2. \u2022\nWe can establish the result stated in the introduction in a similar fashion. This involves\na variant of the Airy group e~td* which solves the linearized KdV equation (ut + uxxx =\n0) in one space dimension.

The Riesz projection\nR+ : D> -> HP onto the Hardy space {\/ e D> \\ \/(\u00a3) = 0; (\u00a3 < 0)} is bounded for\n1 < p < oo; so to obtain almost sure convergence for solutions of (KdV), it suffices to\napply Theorem 1.1 to R+u and (\/ \u2014 R+)u.\n64 G.

In the first\nintegral in (3.16), the phase function is <j)(\\) = A3 \u2014\u00a3 log A; so there is a point of stationary\nphase in the range of integration only when \u00a3 > (3\/2)3, and it occurs at A = (4\/3)1\/3.\nAt this point, <f>\" = 35^3^1^3; consequently, we have an asymptotic expression for the\nmodulus of first integral of (3.16) [12, p. 51] as \u00a3 \u2014> oo, namely\n(3.17)\nLet p and a be as in the statement of the result.

We now introduce\n(4.6)\nwhere g(X) extends to define an entire function; and we proceed to calculate the Fourier\ntransform of h(x) = m(ex).

Almost sure convergence for a cosine family\nIn this section we continue with the formalism of \u00a7 4 to obtain an almost sure convergence\ntheorem for solutions of an abstract second-order equation. The Cauchy problem\nwtt = -\\Afw(x,t), 1\nw(x,0)=f(x), wt(x,0)=0J\nis well posed for \/ \u20ac E in the domain of |J4|9.

(5.2)\nProof. Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 1.1, we can show that\n(' > 0) (5-3)\ndefines a uniformly bounded family of linear operators on E, and that the maximal\nfunction\nH I l (\/\u20ac\u00a3) (5.4)\nt>o\ndefines a strongly bounded sublinear operator E ->\u2022 Lp(J?;\/n).

Blower\nOur next result concerns functions \/ : M. \u2014> X, where X is a complex Banach space\nwith the unconditional martingale difference property.\nDefinition. A Banach space X is said to be a UMD space, provided there is a uniform\nunconditionality constant Cx such that, for all L2-martingale difference sequences (dn)\nwith values in X,\nN\nYj\u00b1d\nn = l\nAT\nI\n\"n=\\\nfor all choices of signs \u00b1. By results of Bourgain and Burkholder, summarized in [3,\nTheorem 2.7], this is equivalent to requiring that the Hilbert transform operator\n(\/ \u20ac L2(K; X)) (5.7)\nx\nbe bounded from L2(R;X) to itself.\nMany of the reflexive spaces of functions which arise in classical analysis have the UMD\nproperty; Hilbert space is an obvious example, the Lebesgue spaces Lp (1 < p < oo) and\nthe von Neumann\u2014Schatten ideals cp (1 < p < oo) are examples presented in [3]. It\nis helpful to note that LP(R;X) is a UMD space whenever X is a UMD space and\n1 < p < oo.\nTheorem 5.2. Let X be a UMD space, 9\/2 < S < 6, 1 < p < oo and let A be\nthe Laplace operator in LP(M.;X). Then there is a uniformly bounded family of linear\noperators on LP(R;X)\np ^ \/ 2 \/ (t > 0), (5.8)\nfor which the maximal function\nf H+ sup \\\\m(t^3VE)f\\\\x (f \u20ac LP(R; X)) (5.9)\nt>o\ndefines a strongly bounded sublinear operator L^IRjX) -> 1\/(11$).\nProof.

(5.10)\nIndeed, the functional calculus map (4.1) is bounded MX(R) -> B{L\"(R;X)) (see\n[1, Theorem 1.2], [6, Theorem 4] and [16, Theorem 6]). Now we can repeat the proof of\nTheorem 1.1 to achieve the desired result. \u2022\nMaximal functions and transference for groups of operators 69\n6. Concluding remarks\nProblem 6.1. It is reasonable to hope that Theorem 5.2 should extend to the Laplace\noperator in Lp(M.d;X) with d > 1, possibly for a restricted range of p. The known esti-\nmates on the modular function of Am are not good enough to achieve this by our method.\nNote that (3.3) is only known to be valid when X is isomorphic (linearly homeomorphic)\nto a Hilbert space. In [17, p. 57], Stein obtains an estimate on the modular function of\nUu whenever (\u2014L) is the generator of a symmetric diffusion semigroup. His estimate is\nindependent of dimension, but it grows exponentially in \\u\\.\nRemark 6.2. We mention some previously known results on the almost everywhere\nconvergence of solutions of the Cauchy problem iwt = Aw, w(x,0) = f(x) for the\nSchrodinger equation in free Euclidean space. Carleson has shown that, for \/ 6 L2(R)\nwith A 1 \/ 8 \/ 6 L2(R), the Cauchy problem is well posed, and w(x,t) \u2014> f(x) almost\neverywhere as t \u2014> 0 [7]. The Sobolev exponent of \/ \u20ac flrl\/'4(R) is optimal when d = 1.\nIn higher space dimensions the optimal value of the index does not appear to be known;\nbut Bourgain has achieved an almost sure convergence result for compactly supported\ninitial data \/ in HP(R2), for some p < 1\/2 [5]. The proofs of these results involve\ndelicate estimates on the kernels of the operator TT* on Hp, where Tf{x) = e'*(a:)a*\/(a:)\nis the maximal function. Standard results described in [19] show that almost everywhere\nconvergence is equivalent to weak (p, q) bounds on a suitable maximal function. The\nTT* method may be used to yield almost everywhere convergence results for KdV-type\nequations. Nevertheless, it does not seem appropriate for vector-valued functions taking\nvalues in Banach spaces, other than Hilbert space [18, pp. 278, 317].\nOur final result gives a characterization of those Lebesgue spaces which are isomorphic\nto Hilbert space, and it suggests that there are limits to what can be achieved using\ntransference arguments for bounded groups of operators. See also [11, 1.5].\nProposition 6.3. Let E be an infinite-dimensional and separable complex Banach\nspace isomorphic to Lp(\/j.). Then p equals 2 if and only if, for each K ^ 1, there is\nC{E, K) < oo such that\nEe\nfor all finite sequences (fj) C E, and all bounded discrete (semi)-groups of operators on\n(linear subspaces of) E with \\\\T*\\\\E^yE < K for all j .\nProof. By Kahane's inequality [15, 9.2], when E is isomorphic to Hilbert space there\nare positive constants c(E) and C{E) with\n1 \/ 2 1 \/ 2\nE j 2 ) ((fj)cE), (6.2)\nII j E \\ j \/\nfrom whence (6.1) follows.\n70 G. Blower\nOur proof of the converse establishes rather more than the statement. Kwapien has\nshown that (6.2) characterizes those Banach spaces which are isomorphic to Hilbert\nspace [14, Theorem l.l(c)]. We suppose, with a view to obtaining a contradiction, that\nthe maximal type of E is p = sup{p | E has type p} < 2. Since E ~ Lp, this supremum\nis attained. Then by the Maurey-Pisier Theorem [15, 13.2, 13.16], IP is finitely repre-\nsentable in E. For each n, we take En to be a subspace of E, 2-isomorphic to \u00a3P(n) and\n\/^-complemented in E. Now we let (TJ')j\n\u20ac\nz be the cyclic group of linear operators on En\nassociated with T-7 : e[r] *-> e^+r], where [r] the equivalence class of r modulo n, and ej\nthe standard unit basis of HP(n). Since En is if-complemented in E, (TJ)j\u20acz extends to\na bounded Co-group on E with ||TJ'||\u00a3_+\u00a3 < 6K. We take fj = e\\ (1 < j < n); then one\ncalculates\nwhereas\n(6.3)\nBut (6.1) cannot then be valid for all n ^ 1 with p < 2.\nFurther, if the minimal cotype of E is q = inf {q \\ E has cotype rj) > 2, then copies\nof tq (n) embed uniformly in E. We use TJ as above, but this time we take fj = ej for\n1 ^ j ^ n and use Khintchine's inequality to show [15, 5.5]\n(6.4)\nwhereas || Y^=i \u00a3jfj\\\\ti = nxlq\\ so for (6.1) to persist for all n, we need q < 2.\nHence p = q = 2, and so (6.2) holds; consequently, by Kwapien's Theorem, E is\nisomorphic to the Hilbert space L2(fi).
