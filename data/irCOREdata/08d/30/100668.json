In the limit of zero pairing, not only are the calculated moments of inertia substantially smaller\nthan for rigid rotation, but also they are close to the experimental values. The moments of inertia are found to\nbe insensitive to dynamic pair correlations.\nPACS number~s!: 21.10.Re, 21.30.Fe, 21.60.Ev, 27.70.1qI. INTRODUCTION\nThe moments of inertia of deformed atomic nuclei at low\nspins are a factor of 2 or 3 smaller than the rigid-body value.\nThe reduction is attributed to the strong pair correlations,\nbecause nuclei in the ground state are in a superfluid con-\ndensed state @1#. Angular momentum is generated by either\nrotating the deformed superfluid or by breaking Cooper pairs\nfrom this condensed state. In order to reach high spins, an\nincreasing number of Cooper pairs are broken, which re-\nduces and finally quenches the pair condensate. It has been\noften stated that after this transition, the moments of inertia\nshould reach the rigid-body value @1,2#. However, this con-\njecture is based on the consideration of two special cases\n@1,2#: ~i! the limit of large particle number, where the nuclear\nshell structure becomes unimportant; and ~ii! nucleons in a\nharmonic oscillator potential at its equilibrium deformation.\nParticularly for independent particles in a harmonic oscil-\nlator potential well, the moment of inertia has in the limit of\nvanishing angular velocity exactly the rigid-body value in\nany combination of stationary single-particle states provided\nthe total energy is stationary with respect to volume-\nconserving variations of the equipotential ellipsoids @3#. At\nfinite angular velocity, the condition for the rigid-body value\nis that the second moments of the density distribution should\nhave the ratio of the squares of the axes of the oscillator-\nplus-centrifugal equipotential ellipsoids, which is not exactly\nequivalent to a stationary energy @4#. These results have led\nto the expectation that in real nuclei, the moment of inertia\nwould not be very different from the rigid-body value if the\npairing is quenched. This expectation was substantiated by\nearly studies like, for example, that in Ref. @5# of more real-\nistic single-nucleon potentials, which seemed to indicate that\npermitting the nuclear system to relax to an equilibrium\nshape generally tends to reduce deviations from the rigid-\nbody moment of inertia due to shell structure. The validity of\nthe aforementioned conjecture for the real nuclear potential\nremains, however, a continuing subject of investigation with\nnew theoretical and experimental techniques, and so does the\nrelated question of the current distribution in a rotating\nnucleus @6\u20138#.\nSystematic deviations from rigid-like behavior at high an-\ngular velocity have been demonstrated for transitional nuclei0556-2813\/2000\/61~6!\/064324~7!\/$15.00 61 0643in the A\u2019110 region @9# and discussed for superdeformed\nnuclei @10,11#. In the present study we address the inertial\nbehavior of a different class of nuclear excitations: high-\nseniority states in well deformed A\u2019180 nuclei ~see also the\nearlier work by Andersson et al. @12#!. Recently, rotational\nbands have been observed in, for example, 178Hf, 178W and\n179W @13\u201316# that are built on configurations with up to four\nbroken pairs ~that is, seniority eight! and high K values,\nwhere K is the angular momentum with respect to the body-\nfixed deformation axis. It is found ~see the empirical data in\nFig. 1! that the moments of inertia are substantially below\nthe rigid-body value. Furthermore, some bands deviate from\nthe linear dependence of the angular momentum on the an-\ngular velocity, expected for the strong coupling of quasipar-\nticles to the deformed field.\nThese features can be explained @17# by the persistence of\npair correlations in the Lipkin-Nogami pairing model, com-\nbined with the assumption that the zero-pairing limit would\nresult in rigid-like rotation. However, since the latter as-\nsumption is not self-evident, a microscopic determination of\nthe moment of inertia in the zero-pairing limit is required. In\nthe present work it is demonstrated, through tilted-axis-\ncranking ~TAC! calculations, that the main experimental fea-\ntures can be understood by assuming that nucleons move in a\nrotating mean field with no pairing. The preliminary results\nof Ref. @18# are extended.\nII. THE TILTED-AXIS-CRANKING MODEL\nTo describe the high-K rotational bands, involving many\nunpaired nucleons and predominant magnetic dipole transi-\ntions, the tilted-axis-cranking approach @19# is employed.\nWhen pairing is neglected, the nuclear state uv& considered\nis a uniformly rotating Slater determinant which is an eigen-\nstate of the \u2018\u2018Routhian\u2019\u2019\nh85hdef~\u00ab2 ,\u00ab4!2v~ j1 sin q1 j3 cos q!, ~1!\nwhere hdef is the Hamiltonian of independent nucleons in a\ndeformed potential, v is the angular velocity, j1 and j3 are\nthe components of the angular momentum with respect to the\nprincipal axes 1 and 3 ~symmetry axis! of the deformed po-\ntential, and q is the angle of the angular velocity with the 3\u00a92000 The American Physical Society24-1\nFRAUENDORF, NEERGA\u02da RD, SHEIKH, AND WALKER PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 064324axis. The total Routhian E8 is obtained by applying the\nStrutinsky renormalization to the energy of the nonrotating\nsystem E0. This kind of approach has turned out to be a quite\nreliable calculation scheme in the case of standard cranking\n@20#. Thus we have\nE8~v ,q ,\u00ab2 ,\u00ab4!5ELD~\u00ab2 ,\u00ab4!2E\u02dc 1^vuh8uv&. ~2!\nBy means of Strutinsky-averaging @21#, the smooth energy E\u02dc\nis calculated from the nonrotating single-nucleon energies,\nobtained from the Hamiltonian hdef(\u00ab2 ,\u00ab4).\nFIG. 1. Functions J(v) calculated without pairing for several\nconfigurations listed in Table I. The value of J is given relative to a\nlinear reference 50 MeV 21v . Solid line: TAC calculation. Dashed\nline: experiment @13\u201316#. Upper panel: bands in 178W. Lower\npanel: bands in 178Hf and 179W. Moments of inertia can be obtained\nfrom the graphs, as J\/v ~kinematic value! and dJ\/dv ~dynamic\nvalue!. The straight line corresponds to the rigid moment of inertia\nJ585 MeV21.06432The orientation angle q is found by requiring the total\nangular momentum JW5^vu jWuv& to be parallel to vW . This\nmakes E8 a minimum with respect to q . In the case of the\nhigh-K bands we are interested in, the rotational axis is\n\u2018\u2018tilted,\u2019\u2019 i.e., it does not coincide with one of the principal\naxes of the deformed potential (q\u00de90\u00b0or 0\u00b0). The equilib-\nrium shape is found by minimizing E8 with respect to the\ndeformation parameters \u00ab2 and \u00ab4 of the potential.\nThe calculated angular momentum J(v)5AJ121J32 is\ncompared with the experimental function, which is con-\nstructed by the standard procedure: In terms of the energy\nlevels E(I) of a DI51 rotational band, where I denotes the\nangular momentum quantum number, one sets v(J)5E(I)\n2E(I21) for J5I . For a given observed band, this defines\na discrete set of empirical pairs of J and v from which the\nexperimental function J(v) is obtained by interpolation.\n\u0086Taking v(J) at J5(I2 12 )1 12 5I simulates a random-phase\napproximation ~RPA! correction to the Hartree-Fock energy\n@22#.\u0087\nIII. SINGLE-NUCLEON HAMILTONIAN AND\nDEFORMATIONS\nIn the present calculation for the nuclei 178Hf, 178W, and\n179W, the modified oscillator form @21# of the Hamiltonian\nhdef was adopted. For the combinations of single-nucleon\nstates listed in Table I, the equilibrium shape at zero angular\nvelocity was determined. Most of the configurations in 178W\nand 179W were found to have equilibrium values of the quad-\nrupole deformation \u00ab2 and hexadecapole deformation \u00ab4 ~see\nRef. @21#! close to \u00ab250.23 and \u00ab450.02. Only the Kp\n545\/22 and 251 configurations, which have a proton in the\n1h9\/2 state, have somewhat larger equilibrium deformations,\ngiven approximately by \u00ab250.25 and \u00ab450.015. In the Kp\n5161 configuration in 178Hf, the equilibrium shape has \u00ab2\n50.22 and \u00ab450.05. These values of the shape parameters\nwere used in the following calculations. The difference be-\ntween the deformation of the Kp545\/22 and 251 configu-\nrations and that of the other configurations in 178W and 179W\nchanges the rigid-body moment of inertia by 6 %.\nFor the Kp545\/22 and 251 configurations, we studied\nthe change of equilibrium shape as a function of the angular\nvelocity. In the relevant interval of v , the variation of \u00ab2\nstays below 0.005 and that of \u00ab4 is negligible. This corre-\nsponds to a 2 % variation of the rigid-body moment of iner-\ntia.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 1 shows the calculated and empirical functions\nJ(v) for the configurations in Table I except those with\nKp572 and 151. A close correspondence between calcula-\ntion and data is apparent from this figure. This includes re-\ncent data for a Kp5301 band in 178W @15#. It is also evident\nthat the moments of inertia are considerably smaller than the\nrigid-body value, which is about 85 MeV21 for these masses\nand shapes. The typical empirical moment of inertia is about\n55 MeV21. The Kp545\/22 and 251 bands are discussed\nlater.4-2\nMOMENTS OF INERTIA FOR MULTIQUASIPARTICLE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 064324TABLE I.

Thus, the upper and middle parts of the 50\u201382\nproton and 82\u2013126 neutron shells, where the Fermi levels\nare situated in these nuclei ~with Z572,74 and N\n5104\u2013106), have a concentration of orbitals that are\nstrongly coupled to the deformed potential. This inhibits the\ngeneration of total angular momentum by alignment of the\nangular momenta of the individual nucleons with the 1 axis.\nThe result is a moment of inertia that is smaller than the\naverage. The effect is illustrated by Fig. 2, which shows that\nin comparison with the weakly coupled 1h9\/2 proton orbital,\nthe angular momentum of the strongly coupled orbitals tends\nto stay closely aligned with the 3 axis, and for some orbitals\neven slightly antialigned with the 1 axis.\nIn contrast, moments of inertia above the average are ex-\npected for nuclei with Fermi levels in the lower parts of the\nmajor shells. Such a variation was actually found through the\n82\u2013126 neutron shell in the detailed calculations in Ref. @5#.\nWith increasing deformation, the shell structure, and hence\nits contribution to the moment of inertia, is progressively\ndamped @5#. Less pronounced deviations from the rigid-body\nvalue are, therefore, expected for superdeformed nuclei.\nIt should be noted that the substantial deviations from the\nrigid-body moment of inertia seen in Fig. 1 occur at the\ncalculated equilibrium shape of each configuration. A similar\nexperience applies to the magnetic susceptibility of small\nmetal clusters @23#, which have a flat-bottom single-particle\npotential like that of atomic nuclei. The deviation from the\nrigid-body moment of inertia reflects a nonrigid flow of mass\nin the rotational states. Such intrinsic mass currents have\nbeen discussed for atomic nuclei by several authors @6\u20138# as\nwell as for small metal clusters @23#.\nThe behavior of the Kp5161, 39\/21, 222 and 301 bands\nis well described in terms of a constant moment of inertia of\neach configuration with a value about 55 MeV21. Such a06432constant moment of inertia corresponds to the familiar ex-\npression for the energy levels in a rotational band built on a\nstrongly coupled intrinsic state, E(I)5@I(I11)2K2#\/2J,\nand it indicates a collective origin of the angular momentum\nwith respect to the 1 axis.\nThe Kp545\/22 and 251 bands show a totally different\nbehavior with a large up-curvature of the function J(v). As-\nymptotically, in the limit of large angular velocity, the mo-\nments of inertia approach values similar to those of the other\nFIG. 2.

As discussed in Ref. @17#, this behavior results from\nthe presence of a 1h9\/2 proton orbital in the configurations of\nthe Kp545\/22 and 251 bands. In fact, as the component v1\nof the angular velocity becomes finite, this weakly coupled\norbital, which intrudes from the the Z582\u2013126 spherical\nshell, immediately aligns its angular momentum with the 1\naxis, thus making a significant contribution to the component\nJ1 of the total angular momentum on the 1 axis. The situa-\ntion is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nThe functions J1(v1) actually calculated for these two\nbands are shown in Fig. 3. Corresponding empirical func-\ntions were extracted from the data by assuming, in close\naccordance with what is calculated, that J3 is constant and\nequal to K, i.e.,\nJ15AJ22K2, v15vA12~K\/J !2. ~3!\nIn the empirical range of v1, both the calculated and the\nmeasured functions are seen to be fairly linear, and extrapo-\nlating these parts of the curves to v150 yields the common\nvalue J152.860.5 ~cf. Fig. 3!.\nIn order to see how the behavior of the Kp545\/22 and\n251 bands seen in Fig. 1 may emerge from this picture,\nconsider an idealized scenario where the 1h9\/2 proton orbital\nmakes a constant contribution i to J1, and all orbitals to-\ngether a constant contribution to J3 equal to K and a contri-\nbution to J1 equal to JRv1, where JR is a constant. ~Such a\nFIG. 3.

They are just presented differently. The lower panel shows\nthe results of the schematic model discussed in Sec. V C. Labels:\npr-tac indicates the cranking case, pr indicates the quantal case.06432schematic model is discussed in more detail in Sec. V C.!\nWith J15JRv11i and Eq. ~3!, we have\nv5S 12 iAJ22K2D vsc , vsc5 JJR , ~4!\nwhere v is seen to become smaller than the frequency vsc\nfor strong coupling (i50).\nIn the calculation, there is a gradual increase of the con-\ntribution i to J1 of the 1h9\/2 proton orbital towards its maxi-\nmum 9\/2. Thus, the assumption above of a constant i was too\nschematic. The calculated curves show a slight down curva-\nture due to saturation of i. The absence of a similar down\ncurvature in the data might be the result of a counteractive\nnonlinearity of the remaining, collective, part of J1. In that\ncase, the present calculation does not get this part quite right\nand overestimates the collective moment of inertia by about\n5 MeV21. Nevertheless, these considerations show that ~i!\nthe essential difference of behavior, induced by the align-\nment with the 1 axis of the angular momentum of the 1h9\/2\nproton, can be well understood, and ~ii! the collective part JR\nis about 55 MeV21, like for the other bands.\nV. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS\nThe calculations for zero pairing, and their comparison\nwith experimental data, constitute the principal outcome of\nthis work. However, it is also instructive to investigate some\nfinite-pairing effects and other model assumptions.\nA. Static pairing\nPairing is taken into account @19# by including the pair\nfield in the quasiparticle Routhian\nh85hdef1D~P11P !2lN2v~ j1 sin q1 j3 cos q!, ~5!\nwhere P1 is the monopole pair operator and N is the particle\nnumber. In order to keep the notation simple we do not dis-\ntinguish between the proton and neutron parts of the pair\nfield. The rotating deformed state is obtained by replacing\nthe Slater determinant by the quasiparticle configuration uv&,\nwhich is the eigenstate of Eq. ~5!. The vector JW is equal to\n^vu jWuv& with this new state uv&. The chemical potential l is\nfixed by requiring ^vuNuv& to be equal to the actual particle\nnumber, and the pair gap D by the self-consistency condition\nD5G^vuPuv&. For D50, this formalism is equivalent to\nthe previous one.\nThe pairing force constants Gn and Gp were determined\nby the condition that the pair gaps in the nuclear ground state\nshould be equal to the empirical odd-even mass differences.\nIt is well known from previous studies ~for instance, Ref.\n@24#! that with increasing angular velocity, the pair gaps and\nchemical potentials change their values essentially stepwise\nwith a successive breaking of Cooper pairs. Since a detailed\ndescription of the paired state is not the concern of this pa-\nper, the chemical potentials and pair gaps were kept constant\nfor each configuration as long as there was no pair breaking\nencountered.4-4\nMOMENTS OF INERTIA FOR MULTIQUASIPARTICLE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 064324The pair gaps determined at the band heads are listed in\nTable I. For most of the configurations, they are seen to\nvanish. Exceptions are the Kp572 and 151 states. These\nhave a common neutron configuration with one broken Coo-\nper pair, which leaves a reduced but finite neutron pair gap.\nThe Kp572 state furthermore has the ground-state proton\nconfiguration and hence the ground-state proton pair gap.\nThe proton configuration of the Kp5151 state is found in\nthe calculation to be just on the border of having a static\nproton pair field. Small variations of Gp about the value\nobtained by adjustment to the odd-even mass difference in\nfact cause Dp to vary between 0 and 0.5 MeV. For the cal-\nculations, we have chosen Dp50, as also listed in Table I.\nThis gives a good agreement with the measured function\nJ(v).\nFigure 4 shows the functions J(v) calculated for the Kp\n572 and 151 bands. Both of them are seen to bend upwards\nnear v50.35 MeV. This is because, by breaking a Cooper\npair, two neutrons in 1i13\/2 orbitals align their angular mo-\nmenta with the 1 axis. For v>0.4 MeV, a vanishing pair gap\nFIG. 4. Functions J(v) calculated for the bands Kp572 ~upper\npanel! and Kp5151 ~lower panel! with and without static pairing.\nSolid line: no pairing.

The labels additionally distinguish between dif-\nferent combinations of the pair gaps: p: Dp51.13 MeV, Dn50; n:\nDp50, Dn50.48 MeV; pn: Dp51.13 MeV, Dn50.48 MeV.

Therefore, in the\nfigure we let the curves calculated with the neutron pair gap\nat the band head join for v>0.4 MeV those calculated with\nDn50. These are about 2 units below the measured curves in\nthis range of v . We could not find a reason for the discrep-\nancy.\nThis pair breaking is of the type known as a BC crossing\n~see, for example, Ref. @25#!. As also seen from Fig. 4, no\nsimilar upbends arise in the case Dn50. This conforms to\nthe general experience @26# that a static pair field is required\nfor band crossings of the types AB , BC , etc. Thus, the pres-\nence of upbends in the data is evidence for a static neutron\npair field in these bands.\nB. Pair fluctuations\nNear the critical point of the vanishing of the static pair\ngap, large fluctuations of the pair field, known as dynamic\npair correlations, are expected @24,27#. Dynamic pair corre-\nlations are taken into account in an approximate way by the\nLipkin-Nogami correction for the fluctuation of particle\nnumber in the BCS state. ~See Ref. @28# and references\ntherein.! For several configurations, we made the Lipkin-\nNogami calculation at the band head. The resulting Lipkin-\nNogami pair gaps are also shown in Table I. With these gaps,\nJ(v) was calculated as in the case of static pairing ~see Sec.\nV A!, except that the chemical potentials were adjusted with\nthe angular velocity so as to keep the correct expectation\nvalues of the proton and neutron numbers.\nThe calculated functions J(v) for the Kp5161 and 251\nbands shown in Fig. 5 are representative for the results. It is\nseen that relative to the calculation without pairing, the pair\nfields produced by the Lipkin-Nogami pair gaps make only\nminor corrections to the angular momentum ~of the order of\n1 unit!, which do not improve the agreement with experi-\nment. Thus, pair fluctuations appear to be inessential for the\nexplanation of the observed deviations from the rigid value\nFIG. 5.

There it was found\nthat at frequencies where the static pair gap is zero the pair\nfluctuations reduce the angular momentum by 3\u20134 units in\nthe yrast band of even-even nuclei. The different sensitivity\nto the pair correlations may be understood. In order to gen-\nerate the angular momentum along the 3 axis ~high K) sev-\neral pairs are broken. This blocks the affected single-particle\nstates from taking part in the pair correlations. However, it is\njust the contribution of these particles near the Fermi surface\nwhich is most sensitive to the pair correlations. In the case of\nthe yrast bands of the even-even nuclei only one neutron pair\n(1i13\/2) is broken. Consequently these bands are more sensi-\ntive to the pair fluctuations. This argument is consistent with\nRefs. @24,27#, where it was found that in bands with two\nbroken pairs ~odd-A nuclei and negative parity bands in\neven-even nuclei! the pair fluctuations reduce the angular\nmomentum only by 1\u20132 units. Hence, only the low-K bands\nare suited to study the influence of the pair fluctuations on\nthe moments of inertia.\nC. A particle-rotor model calculation\nIt was seen in Sec. IV that the behavior of the Kp\n545\/22 and 251 bands at low angular velocity is largely\ndetermined by a single proton in a 1h9\/2 orbital. The behav-\nior was qualitatively explained in terms of a particle-rotor\nmodel where all nucleons except the 1h9\/2 proton are as-\nsumed to make a constant contribution to J3 equal to KR\n5K2 12 and a contribution to J1 equal to JRv1, where JR is\na constant. This situation may be further analyzed by calcu-\nlating the quantal states of this model. In particular, we ad-\nFIG. 6. Moments of inertia dJ1 \/dv1. Solid lines are the TAC\ncalculation and experimental values @14,15#. Dotted lines are the\nPAC calculations, favored and unfavored bands. Upper panel is the\nKp5251 band. Lower panel is the Kp5301 band. The discrepancy\nbetween the TAC calculation and the experimental data for the\nKp5251 band at low v1 is discussed at the end of Sec. IV.06432dress the question of whether the deviations between the ex-\nperiment and the calculation in the upper panel of Fig. 3 are\nrelated to the violation of angular momentum conservation in\nthe TAC model. A quantal treatment of the system of a par-\nticle coupled to a KR\u00de0 rotor was given previously in Ref.\n@29#.\nThe coupling of the 1h9\/2 proton to the deformed core is\ntreated in a schematic way. The particle space is restricted to\na multiplet of angular-momentum eigenstates with quantum\nnumber j59\/2, and hdef , acting on the single proton, is taken\nto be a quadratic function of j3. The coefficient of this qua-\ndratic function is chosen so as to reproduce the splitting of\nthe 1h9\/2 proton level found for the full Hamiltonian hdef at\nthe deformations of the Kp545\/22 and 251 band heads ~see\nSec. III!.\nThe particle-rotor problem can be treated in the semiclas-\nsical TAC approximation. The details are described in Ref.\n@30#. The function J1(v1) of the Kp5251 band thus calcu-\nlated with JR555 MeV21 is shown in the lower panel of\nFig. 3. It is seen that the schematic model reproduces the\nresult of the full TAC calculation, seen in the upper panel,\nvery closely.\nThe result of the exact quantal treatment of the same\nparticle-rotor model is also shown in the lower panel of Fig.\n3. In order to generate the plot the quantal energies are\ntreated like empirical ones ~see Secs. II and IV!. The quantal\ncalculation conforms better to the data than the TAC ap-\nproximation in producing a more linear function J1(v1).\nHowever, extrapolating this function from the empirical\nrange of v1 to v150 yields J153.5, which is significantly\nlarger than the empirical value J152.8.\nThe different behaviors of the quantal particle-rotor\nmodel and the TAC approximation to it arise essentially\nfrom replacing the recoil energy ( j121 j22)\/2JR by ^ j1&2\/2JR\n@30#. While the former is approximately a constant, the latter\nacts as a potential that hinders the increase of ^ j1&. Contrary\nto the quantal model, the cranking model was seen to repro-\nduce the extrapolated value of J1 found empirically for the\nKp545\/22 and 251 bands. Thus, the nuclear system does\nnot seem to absorb the recoil angular momentum of the 1h9\/2\nproton into just a single degree of freedom, as assumed in the\nquantal particle-rotor model. The present study does not pro-\nvide an answer to the interesting question: How can the ex-\nperimental curve J1(v1) be so strikingly linear while the\nalignment is far from being complete?\nD. How important is tilting the cranking axis?\nIn the standard principal-axis cranking ~PAC! model, v3\n50 is assumed. Thus, one obtains a function J1(v1). A cor-\nresponding empirical function is extracted from the data by\ncombining the TAC geometry with the assumption J35K\n5constant for a rotational band with a band head angular-\nmomentum quantum number K @31#. What makes the essen-\ntial difference between the PAC and TAC models is thus the\nterm 2v3 j3 in the Routhian ~1! of the latter. This term vio-\nlates the invariance under rotation by the angle 180\u00b0 about\nthe 1-axis, whose eigenvalue is the \u2018\u2018signature.\u2019\u2019 In the PAC4-6\nMOMENTS OF INERTIA FOR MULTIQUASIPARTICLE . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW C 61 064324model, a \u2018\u2018favored\u2019\u2019 and an \u2018\u2018unfavored\u2019\u2019 function J1(v1),\nwhere the latter is the larger, are associated with a configu-\nration with K\u00de0. These functions have opposite signature\nand correspond to two separate level sequences with DI52.\nDerivatives dJ1 \/dv1 for the Kp5251 and 301 bands\ncalculated in both models are compared with the correspond-\ning empirical data in Fig. 6. The derivative is seen to depend\nmuch more violently on v1 in the PAC model than in the\nTAC model. Furthermore, the PAC calculation shows a sub-\nstantial signature splitting. Since neither of these features is\nseen in the data, it must be concluded that the term 2v3 j3 in\nthe Routhian ~1! is significant for the description of these\nhigh K bands. The difference between the PAC and TAC\nresults is larger for the Kp5301 than the Kp5251 band.\nThis is due to the smaller deformation \u00ab2 of the former.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIt has been shown quantitatively how the moments of in-\nertia in the zero-pairing limit may be substantially lower than06432the rigid-body value, indicating the presence of mass cur-\nrents of quantal origin in the body-fixed frame of reference.\nLower-than-rigid moments of inertia are both calculated and\nobserved systematically for rotational bands in 178Hf, 178W,\nand 179W, where the neutron and proton Fermi levels are in\nthe mid-to-upper portions of their respective shells. The\nanalysis of a number of high-seniority bands shows that they\nbehave as if the nuclei rotate in the unpaired state. The lim-\nited sensitivity of the calculated multiquasiparticle rotational\nmotion to pair gaps in the range 0\u201350 % of their full value\nsuggests that moments of inertia of high-K bands may not be\nsignificantly affected by dynamic pair correlations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the U.K. Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council and by U.S. DOE\nGrant No. DE-FG02-95ER40934.@1# A.
