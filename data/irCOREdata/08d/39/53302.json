Introduction \nThe understanding of the interfacial phenomena between vitreous enamels and ceramic materials is of \ngreat interest in both engineering and scientific fields. In many technological applications where \nvitreous enamels are fired onto ceramic substrates, the performance of the article is directly linked to \nthe nature of the enamel-ceramic interface. Many studies to investigate these phenomena have been \ncarried out, however, they have been principally concerned with the wettability of zirconia and other \noxide ceramics on metals [1-5] as well as the adhesion of silicone sealants to aluminium [6] and the \ncoating of aluminium alloys with ceramic materials [7, 8]. The interfacial mechanisms investigated \nhave centred principally around the thermodynamic criterion [2, 3, 5], the electronic theory [4] and \nthe occurrence of oxidation [1, 9]. \nTo date, very little work has been published with regard to the use of lasers for modifying surface \nproperties of materials in order to improve their wettability characteristics. Notwithstanding this, it is \nrecognised within the currently published work that laser irradiation of material surfaces can effect its \nwettability characteristics. Previously Zhou et al [7, 8] have carried out work on laser coating of \naluminium alloys with ceramic materials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc), reporting on the well documented fact \nthat generated oxide layers often promote metal\/oxide wetting. Bahners et al [10, 11], have observed \nand comprehensively detailed the changes in technical properties of various textile fibres, including \nadhesion and wetting properties, with a view to developing an alternative to the conventional \nmethods of chemical agents addition or wet-chemical pre-processing. However, the reasons for these \nchanges with regard to changes in the material\u2019s surface tension are not reported. \nThe technique described in this paper, that of using high power diode laser (HPDL) beams to \ndetermine the effects of laser radiation on the wettability characteristics and bonding mechanisms of \nan amalgamated alumina\/silica-based oxide compound (AOC) mix and a vitreous enamel, has been \nemployed by the authors to enable the sealing, by means of laser enamelling, of ceramic tile grouts \n[12]. \n \n \n 4 \n2. Theoretical background \n2.1 Contact angle and wettability \nWhen a drop of liquid is placed on a solid surface it may remain as a spherical drop, or spread             \nto cover (wet) the solid surface [13]. The angle with which the liquid subtends the solid is known                               \nas the contact angle. In practice, for wetting to occur the contact angle is less than 900. If the                                \ncontact angle is greater than 900 then the liquid does not wet the solid and no adhesion occurs [13]. \nOnce irradiated by the HPDL beam the enamel powder melts, transforming to a liquid phase. As \nsuch, the process of the bonding of the enamel to the AOC substrate is determined by the wettability                     \nof the two component parts. When a drop of liquid is brought into contact with a flat solid surface,     \nthe final shape taken by the drop, and thus whether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon                    \nthe relative magnitudes of the molecular forces that exist within the liquid (cohesive) and between  \nthe liquid and the solid (adhesive) [13]. The index of this effect is the contact angle \u03b8, which                     \nthe liquid subtends with the solid. \u03b8 is related to the solid and liquid surface energies, \u03b3sv and \u03b3lv, and \nthe solid-liquid interfacial energy \u03b3sl, through the principle of virtual work expressed by                            \nthe rearranged Young\u2019s equation: \n   cos\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n\u2212sv sl\nlv\n (1) \nClearly, to achieve wetting \u03b3sv should be large, while \u03b3sl and \u03b3lv should be small. Hence liquids of a \nlower surface tension will always spread over a solid surface of higher surface tension in order to \nreduce the total free-energy of the system [14]. This is due to fact that the molecular adhesion \nbetween solid and liquid is greater than the cohesion between the molecules of the liquid [13]. \nThe adhesion energy of a liquid to a solid surface (the work of adhesion) Wad, is given by the Young-\nDupre equation: \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (2) \n 5 \nIt is important to consider also the influence of the substrate surface roughness on the wetting contact \nangle. According to Neumann [15], a model similar to that for heterogeneous solid surfaces can be \ndeveloped in order to account for surface irregularities, being given by Wenzel\u2019s equation: \n ( )r sv sl lv w\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b8\u2212 = cos  (3) \n where,       r  =  Roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and  \n     apparent surface areas \n     \u03b8w  = Contact angle for the wetting of a rough surface  \nClearly, as Equation (3) shows, the influence of surface roughness on the contact angle is to affect an \nincrease in the contact angle. Thus, the smoother the contact surface is, then the smaller the contact \nangle will be.   \n2.2 Surface energy and the polar\/dispersive characteristics \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [16]. The majority of \nthese forces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total \nsurface energy comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component; \nsince van der Waals forces are present in all systems regardless of their chemical nature). Therefore, \nthe surface energy of any system can be described by [16] \n \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3= +d p  (4) \nSimilarly, Wad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the \ninterface [16]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (5) \n \n \n 6 \nBy equating Equation (5) with Equation (2), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related \nto the surface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (6) \n3. Experimental procedures \n3.1 Materials \nA newly developed ceramic tile grout compound consisting of mixed vitrifiable oxide powders such \nas chamotte (mainly SiO2 (53wt%) and Al2O3 (42wt%)), Fe2O3, MgO, ZrO2 and ZnO was produced. \nThe oxide powders were sieved to ensure a particle size of less than 75\u00b5m, then thoroughly mixed \ntogether to ensure homogeneity, along with approximately 50wt% diluted sodium silicate solution so \nas to form a manageable paste. The AOC was then pasted on to an ordinary Portland cement (OPC) \nsubstrate to a thickness of 2mm and allowed to cure at room temperature for 12 hours. The set \ncompound was then irradiated using the HPDL and immediately pasted over with a thin layer \n(250\u00b5m) of commercially available enamel frit (Ferro Ltd.) which, in order to form a manageable \npaste, was mixed with 20wt% white spirit. The composition of the enamel consisted mainly of the \nfollowing; SiO2, B2O3, Na2O, Mn, F and small quantities of Ba, Al2O3 and Ni, whilst the powder size \nwas less than 75\u00b5m. The enamel frit paste was allowed to cure at room temperature for one to two \nhours and then irradiated immediately with the HPDL beam. \n3.2 Laser processing procedure \nThe laser used in the study was a surgical HPDL (Diomed Ltd.), emitting at 810nm \u00b120nm and \noperating in the CW mode with rated optical powers ranging from 0-60 W. The laser beam was \ndelivered to the work area by means of a 4m long, 600\u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of \nwhich was connected to a 2:1 focusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC gantry \ntable. The AOC was irradiated using the defocused high order mode HPDL beam with a beam spot \ndiameter of 1.75mm and laser powers (measured at the workpiece using a Power Wizard power \nmeter) of 20-55 W. Fig. 1 illustrates the laser processing experimental arrangement, where the \n 7 \ndefocused laser beam was fired across the surface of the AOC by traversing the samples beneath the \nlaser beam using the x- and y-axis of the CNC gantry table at speeds ranging from 5-8 mms-1, whilst 3 \nlmin-1 of coaxially blown O2 assist gas was used to shield the laser optics. \nIn order to analyse the laser treated specimens, they were sectioned with a Struers cutting machine \nusing a diamond rimmed cutting blade, and then polished using cloths and diamond suspension pastes \ndown to 3\u00b5m. The sectioned samples were then examined using optical microscopy, scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM), energy disperse X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) \ntechniques. \n3.3 Wetting and surface energy analysis procedures \nTo examine the wetting and surface energy characteristics of the AOC two sets of wetting  \nexperiments were conducted. The first set of experiments were to simply determine the contact angle \nbetween the enamel and the AOC before and after laser treatment. The second set of experiments \nwere control experiments carried out using a variety of liquids with known surface energy properties \nin order to quantify any surface energy changes in the AOC resulting from laser irradiation. \nThe enamel-AOC wetting experiments were carried out in atmospheric conditions with molten \ndroplets of the enamel (6000C). The temperature of the enamel throughout the experiments was \nmeasured using a Cyclops infrared pyrometer. The droplets were released in a controlled manner onto \nthe surface of the AOC (treated and untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant \nvolume of the drops being approximately 15 x 10-3 cm3. Profile photographs of the sessile enamel \ndrop were obtained for every 600C fall in temperature of the molten enamel drop, with the contact \nangle subsequently being measured. \nThe control experiments were carried out using: human blood, human blood plasma, glycerol and            \n4-octanol. The test liquids, along with their total surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ) as well as the dispersive (\u03b3 lv\nd\n) \nand polar (\u03b3 lv\np\n) components, are detailed in Table I. The experiments were conducted in atmospheric \nconditions at a temperature of 200C with the temperature of the liquids themselves throughout the \nexperiments also being maintained at 200C. The droplets were released in a controlled manner onto \nthe surface of the test substrate materials (treated and untreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with \nthe resultant volume of the drops being approximately 6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three \n 8 \nminutes with profile photographs of the sessile drops being obtained every minute, with the contact \nangle subsequently being measured. \n4. Effects of laser radiation on the amalgamated oxide compound \nIn order to bond together the oxide compounds the amalgamation was mixed with 50wt% diluted \nsodium silicate solution. Sodium silicate solution (waterglass) is a viscous colourless solution of \ncolloidal sodium silicate. It is a silica containing aqueous solution that, when combined with other \nsolutions such as the amalgamated oxide compound, forms a gel-like mass of silicate hydrate. Such a \nmass remains soft and malleable until it is exposed to CO2 gas, either by means of a gas jet or through \ncontact with the atmosphere [17]. But, exposure of the hardened mass to water results in a reversing \nof the process and the mass returns to a gel-like state.  \nThe fact that the AOC in an un-heated state is hydraulically bonded, as opposed to chemically \nbonded, combined with the retention of chemical and mechanical water (that is water that is bonded \ninto the materials matrix and additional free-water respectively) means that the hardened mass will \nrehydrate when exposed to water [17, 18]. Heating of the hardened AOC mass fires the waterglass \n(similar to that of a ceramic material) [17], increasing its strength and enabling it to withstand water \nexposure. Thus, heating of the AOC is similar in effect to the firing of ceramics, in that the heating \ncauses gradual ceramic \u2018sintering\u2019 of the materials; generally bonding together and stabilising the \nsubstances [17, 19]. As such, exposure of the AOC to laser radiation results in rapid heating of the \nsurface, for most materials typically 103-105 0Cs-1 [20], which will lead to such sintering of the AOC \nsurface with the removal of the pores between the starting particles of the compound, combined with \ngrowth together and strong bonding between adjacent particles [21], thus, a much more consolidated \nsurface is created. Indeed, surface roughness measurements revealed that the surface roughness had \ndecreased from an Ra value of 25.85\u00b5m before laser treatment, to 6.27\u00b5m after laser treatment. Also, \nit was found that heating of the AOC above 1000C resulted in sufficient pyrochemical changes to \nprevent any rehydration.  \nFrom Fig. 2(a) it can be seen clearly that before laser treatment the surface of the AOC appears \ncoarse, with individual crystals of the constituent components being clearly discernible. After laser \ntreatment (Fig. 2(b)) there is more surface ordering, with the surface appearing cellular-dendritic, \n 9 \nshowing that fusion of the individual particulates has occurred. Such a solidification structure is \nindicative of rapidly solidified microstructures [22]. Moreover, an XRD analysis of the AOC surface \nbefore and after laser treatment (Fig. 3) revealed that, on the whole, the phases present within the \nlaser treated region were the same, however, their proportions were different. In particular, after laser \ntreatment it was not possible to detect any SiO2 whilst the Al2O3 was depleted. But, as the EDX \nanalysis shows (Fig. 4) Si and Al were still present in similar proportions on the AOC surface before \nand after laser treatment. This indicates that partial laser vitrification of the AOC surface has \noccurred due to the fact that these materials are glass forming elements, and as such, vitrified when \nirradiated. \n5. Wettability and surface energy characteristics \n5.1 Contact angle and wettability \nAn optical micrograph of a sessile drop of enamel (200C) placed on the surface of the AOC before (a) \nand after (b) laser irradiation with the contact angle superimposed is shown in Fig. 5. The \nexperimental results showed that throughout the period of cooling of the enamel, from the molten \nstate at 6000C to the solid state at room temperature, no discernible change in the magnitude of the of \nthe contact angle took place during the time of the experiments. This indicates that thermodynamic \nequilibrium was established at the solid-liquid interface at the outset of the experiment [23].  \nFig. 5 shows clearly that prior to laser treatment it was not possible to fire the enamel onto the \nsurface of the AOC since the contact angle was measured as 1180, and as such would prevent the \nenamel from wetting the AOC surface. Indeed, laser interaction with the enamel when placed on the \nuntreated AOC surface simply resulted in the \u2018balling\u2019 of the enamel; the formation of small spheres \napproximately the diameter of the laser beam itself [24, 25]. One explanation for the fact that laser \ntreatment of the AOC is necessary so that the enamel completely wets and adheres to the surface of \nthe AOC is that the surface resulting from the laser treatment is significantly smoother, with an Ra \nvalue of 25.85\u00b5m compared with 6.27\u00b5m, and, according to Equation (3), will intrinsically affect a \nreduction in the contact angle. Also, wetting will have certainly been influenced by the increase in the \noxygen content of the AOC surface as a result of the laser treatment, since this is known to increase \nthe likelihood of wetting [1, 9]. Indeed, by mounting cross-sectioned samples of the untreated and \n 10 \nlaser treated AOC next to each other, and examining them both simultaneously by means of EDX, it \nis possible to determine the relative element content of oxygen near to the surface. Values of 28.27% \nand 38.53% for the untreated and laser treated AOC respectively were obtained from such an EDX \nanalysis which probed to a depth of approximately 1\u00b5m below the surface of both samples. As one \ncan see, an increase of 36.29% in the amount of oxygen due to the oxidisation on the laser treated \nsurface of AOC has occurred, indicating that oxygen enrichment of the laser treated AOC surface is \nactive in promoting wetting and bonding. \n5.2 Amalgamated oxide compound surface energy and its dispersive\/polar character \nIt is possible to adequately estimate the dispersive component of the AOC surface energy \u03b3 sv\nd\n by \nusing Equation (6), and plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv. Thus the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n is \nestimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)1\/2) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the \nintercept point of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the \nabscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1 [16]. Fig. 6 shows the best-fit plot of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv according to \nEquation (6) for the untreated and laser treated AOC-experimental control liquids system. Comparing \nthe ordinate intercept points of the untreated and laser treated AOC-liquid systems, it can be seen \nclearly from Fig. 6 that for the untreated AOC-liquid systems the best-fit straight line intercepts the \nordinate closer to the origin. This indicates that, in principle, dispersion forces act mainly at the \nAOC-liquid interfaces resulting in poor adhesion [16, 26]. In contrast, Fig. 6 shows that the best-fit \nstraight line for the laser treated AOC-liquid systems intercepts the ordinate considerably higher \nabove the origin. This is indicative of the action of polar forces across the interface, in addition to \ndispersion forces, hence improved wettability and adhesion is promoted [16, 26]. \nIt is not possible to determine the value of the polar component of the AOC surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n \ndirectly from Fig. 6. This is because the intercept of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) is at \n( )2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3sv\np\nlv\np\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and not the control liquid system. \nHowever, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface energies due to dispersion \nforces either of the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability performance [16, 27]. Thus it is \n 11 \npossible to calculate the dispersive component of the work of adhesion, Wad\nd\n from Equation (5). The \nresults reveal that for each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and laser \ntreated AOC surfaces, Wad  can be correlated with Wad\nd\n by the relationship \n W aW bad ad\nd= +  (7) \nAlso, for the control test liquids used, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar \ncomponents of the control test liquids surface energies has been deduced which satisfies the equation \n  ( ) ( )\u03b3 \u03b3lvp lvd\n1 2 1 2\n13 115\n\/ \/\n. .= +  (8) \nBy introducing Equation (7) into Equation (5) and rearranging, then \n  ( )W a W bad\np\nad\nd= \u2212 +1  (9) \nBy combining Equation (9) with Equation (5) and differentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, then the \nfollowing can be derived: \n  ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (10) \nFrom a plot of Equation (9), a can be determined for the untreated and laser treated AOC (1.2 and 1.7 \nrespectively). Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the untreated and laser treated AOC from \nFig. 6, then it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and laser treated AOC using Equation (10). \nTable II details the values determined for \u03b3 sv\nd\n and \u03b3 sv\np\n for both the untreated and laser treated AOC. \nClearly the HPDL treatment of the surface of the AOC leads to a reduction in the total surface energy \n\u03b3sv, whilst increasing the polar component of the surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n, thus improving the action of \nwetting and adhesion. Such changes in the surface energy of the AOC after laser treatment are due to \nthe fact that HPDL treatment of the surface of the AOC results in partial vitrification of the surface; a \ntransition that is known to affect a reduction in  \u03b3sv  and an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n [23]. \n 12 \n6. Bonding mechanisms \nBased on the nature of the attractive forces existing across the liquid-solid interface, wetting can be \nclassified into the two broad categories of physical wetting and chemical wetting. In physical wetting \nthe attractive energy required to wet a surface is provided by the reversible physical forces (van der \nWaals). In chemical wetting adhesion is achieved as a result of reactions occurring between the \nmating surfaces, giving rise to chemical bonds [28]. In either case, the driving force for wetting is the \nreduction of the surface free energy of the solid AOC by the liquid enamel (\u03b3sv - \u03b3sl). Spreading \nrequires the additional contribution to the driving force of the free energy of the interfacial reaction \n[29]. \nIn practice, complex combinations of various bonding mechanisms actually occur, varying according \nto the types of materials used [28]. For the AOC and the enamel, the mechanisms involved                         \nin ceramic-glass bonding are reasonably applicable. These principally include physical bonding   (van \nder Waals forces), chemical bonding (oxide transformation and O2 bridging) and on a very  small \nscale, electrochemical reactions such as the electrolytic effect due to the presence of                     \nferric oxides within the AOC reacting with other oxides in the enamel [28]. In the particular case of \nthe AOC and the enamel, the bonding mechanism is principally the result of physical forces. This is \nbecause adhesion between many materials is assured by electron transfer and is therefore related to \nbandgap energy [4, 9]. Thus, for non-conducting materials, such as the AOC, with large bandgaps, \nthere will be practically no free charges inside the ceramic crystals, even at elevated temperatures. In \nthis case the electron transfer at the interface will not take place since the electron transfer depends \nexclusively on the concentration of free charges in the ceramic crystal [4]. As a result, the chemical \ncontribution to the work of adhesion is negligible since Wad can be expressed as the sum of the \ndifferent contributions of the interfacial interactions between the two phases [5]:  \n   W W W Wad non equil chem equil vdw= + +\u2212 \u2212  (11) \nWnon-equil represents the non-equilibrium contribution to the work of adhesion when a chemical \nreaction takes place at the interface. Wchem-equil is the cohesive energy between the two contacting \nphases, which is resulted from the establishment of the chemical equilibrium bonds achieved by the \nmutual saturation of the free valences of the contacting surfaces. Wvdw is the energy of the van der \n 13 \nWaals interaction. Consequently, the work of adhesion Wad, is chiefly only resulted from the van der \nWaals interaction.  \nThe bonding mechanism between the laser treated AOC and the enamel, however, was found to be \nnot entirely due to physical forces. An EDX analysis conducted at the interface between the AOC and \nthe enamel revealed the presence of a small diffusion region which contained elements unique to the \nAOC (Mg, Zr, etc.) and the enamel (Mn, Ni, etc.). This is perhaps to be expected since enamel glazes \non ceramic materials, such as the AOC, are typically bonded as a result of some of the base material \ndissolving into the glaze [28], with wetting characteristics often being achieved or enhanced by a \nreaction at the interface at an elevated temperature [29]. Also, when the samples were pulled apart in \nthis region, debris from both components was found on each of the two pieces, indicating the possible \naction of some form of chemical bonding. However, such evidence could also be seen as indicating \nthat the van der Waals bond between the enamel and the AOC was stronger than the actual cohesive \nforces within the AOC.  \nAs one can see from Fig. 7, there is no dendritic growth in the bond region which is characteristic of \nenamels fired onto substrates containing Fe, Si and in particular Co [29]. However, it can be seen that \nenamel is held firm in the surface irregularities, thus ensuring sound adhesion. Again, such \nmechanical bonding is typical of enamel glazes on materials [30]. \n7. Conclusion \nContact angle measurements revealed that because of the wettability characteristics of the AOC, laser \nsurface treatment was necessary in order to allow the enamel to wet and adhere to the AOC surface. \nAs such, the laser treatment of the AOC surface resulted in the contact angle decreasing from 1180 to \n330. Wetting, and subsequent bonding, of the enamel to the AOC surface after laser treatment was \nidentified as being due to: \n1. The laser sintering of the AOC surface reducing the surface roughness from an Ra value of \n25.85\u00b5m before laser treatment, to 6.27\u00b5m after laser treatment, thus directly reducing the \ncontact angle \u03b8\n 14 \n2. The increase in the polar component of the surface energy \u03b3 sv\np\n, (2.00 mJm-2 to 16.15 mJm-2) \nafter laser treatment as a result of the partial laser vitrification of the glass forming elements \nwithin the AOC composition, thus improving the action of wetting and adhesion. \n3. The 36.29% increase in the surface oxygen content of the AOC resulting from laser \ntreatment was identified as further promoting the action of wetting. \nThe bonding mechanisms of the enamel to the AOC were identified as being principally the result of \nvan der Waals forces due to the chemical nature of the AOC. However, evidence of some chemical \nbonding due to some of the base AOC material dissolving into the enamel glaze was observed.  \nThis work demonstrates that it is possible to alter the wetting characteristics of the AOC using the \nHPDL to facilitate the firing of a vitreous enamel onto the AOC surface, a task not possible without \nlaser treatment. But, moreover, the findings of this work show that with the use of laser radiation it is \na distinct possibility that the wetting characteristics of many other materials could be altered. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the EPSRC: Process Engineering Group (Grant \nNo. GR\/K99770), the EPSRC: CDP Group (CASE Award No. 95562556) and BNFL for their \nfinancial support.
