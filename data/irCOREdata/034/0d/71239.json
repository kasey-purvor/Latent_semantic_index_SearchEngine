I show how spoken communication is mainly structured via a set of \nsource domains that conventionally apply to a wide variety of target domains, such as the \nsource domains of MOTION, PHYSICAL TRANSFER, PHSYICAL CONSTRUCTION and PHYSICAL \nSUPPORT. Each of these source domains structures a particular aspect of speech activity, \nsuch as the achievement of communicative goals, the expression of meanings and ideas, \nthe performance of speech acts, the negotiation of mutual relationships, and so on. I \nsuggest that the particular conceptual mappings that underlie the main patterns in my data \nare best seen in terms of Grady\u2019s (1997) notion of primary metaphors, i.e. as simple, \nbasic mappings that have a firm experiential basis and that apply to a wide range of \ndifferent areas of experience (e.g. \u201cHELP\/ASSISTANCE IS SUPPORT\u201d). However, I also show \nthat the main primary metaphors involved in structuring the domain of speech activity \ncan be combined into a single overall physical scenario in which interactants can move in \ndifferent directions, place themselves in different positions in relation to each other, come \ninto contact with each other in different ways, physically produce texts\/utterances\/speech \nacts, physically pass texts\/utterances\/speech acts to each other, and make meanings \nvisible to each other in different ways. Finally, I argue that a corpus-based methodology \nhas much to offer to metaphor research, particularly in the extrapolation of conceptual \nmetaphors from linguistic data. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nFrom the very early days of cognitive metaphor theory, a great deal of attention has been \ndevoted to the way in which speakers of English metaphorically construct the domain of \ncommunication in everyday language. Reddy\u2019s (1979) account of the \u201cconduit\u201d metaphor \ninfluenced most later discussions of metaphors for communication (e.g. Lakoff and \nJohnson 1980: 10-12; Grady 1997, 1998; K\u00f6vecses 2002: 73-4, Taylor 2002: 490), while \nLakoff and Johnson\u2019s (1980) Metaphors We Live By opened with an equally influential \n 2\ndiscussion of  the conceptual metaphor \u201cARGUMENT IS WAR\u201d . A number of other studies \nhave pointed out further source domains that are conventionally applied, in English, to \nthe domain of communication, including particularly the domain of motion (Sweetser \n1987, K\u00f6vecses 2002: 80, Goossens et al. 1995, Traugot and Dasher 2002: 190ff.) \n \nIn this paper I develop and partly correct the view of the metaphorical construction of \ncommunication that has been presented so far, on the basis of the analysis of over 3,500 \nreferences to speech activity in a corpus of written British English. I will argue that my \nanalysis provides a more complete (although by no means exhaustive) account of how \nspoken communication is metaphorically talked about in English, and that this in turn \nleads to the formulation of more reliable hypotheses about underlying conceptual \nmetaphors than is the case when data is less extensive, less varied, and, in some cases, \npartly generated by the analyst(s) (see Vanparys 1995: 2-6 for similar considerations). \n \nMy main overall finding is that, in my data, speech activity is metaphorically talked about \nby means of expressions that: \n1) Potentially evoke a fairly wide range of different source domains (for example, the \nuse of the verb \u201cattack\u201d in \u201cDelors attacked Balladur\u2019s idea of a \u201cEurope of \ncircles\u201d\u201d potentially evokes the domain of PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; the use of the verb \n\u201csupport\u201d in \u201cMr Milosevic supported the plan then\u201d potentially evokes the domain \nof PHYSICAL SUPPORT); \n2) Are also often used metaphorically to talk about domains of experience other than \ncommunication (for example, the verb \u201cattack\u201d can be used to talk about illness in \nexpressions such as \u201cthe infection attacks the lymphatic system\u201d from the British \nNational Corpus, hereafter the BNC;  the verb \u201csupport\u201d can be used to talk about \nfinancial contributions in expression such as \u201cOur work in the African continent [. . .] \nis supported by Tear Fund\u201d, from the BNC). \nIn other words, the highly complex domain of speech activity is, not surprisingly, \nconventionally structured via a number of different metaphorical source domains. These \nsource domains are not specific to speech activity in particular, but have a very wide \nmetaphorical \u201cscope\u201d, i.e. they conventionally apply to a wide range of target domains \n(K\u00f6vecses 2000b, 2002: 108ff.).  \n \nThe complexity of the particular target domain I am concerned with mostly lies in the \nfact that  speech activity involves a number of different aspects, including, for example, \nthe production of utterances, the performance of illocutionary acts, the expression and \nexchange of ideas, the expression of agreement or disagreement with others\u2019 views, the \nexpression and negotiation of mutual relationships, the achievement of goals via speech, \nand so on. In my data, each of these different aspects is consistently structured by one or \nmore wide-scope source domain(s). In order to provide a broad overview of my findings, \nI list below the source domains that feature most prominently in my data, and the aspects \nof speech activity they conventionally apply to. As I will show in more detail at the end \nof the paper, the ordering of the list reflects, in descending order, the frequency of \noccurrence of expressions relating to each particular source domain in my data (N.B \nunless otherwise indicated, examples are taken from my corpus; the relevant \nmetaphorically used words are underlined): \n 3\n \n\u2022 The source domain of TRANSFER (OF OBJECTS) is applied to the expression of meanings, \nthoughts, ideas (which Reddy 1979 called \u201c repertoire members\u201d or RMs), and to the \nproduction of utterances and speech acts (e.g. \u201cSir Hugh gave his assessment last \nMonday\u201d); \n\u2022 The source domain of PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION (OF OBJECTS) is applied to the \nproduction of utterances and speech acts (e.g. \u201cmake a comment\u201d) and to the further \nexpression of similar meanings and ideas to those that have already been previously \nexpressed (e.g. \u201cBut he added: \u201cWe need to work out whether the pluses outweigh the \nminuses\u201d); \n\u2022 The source domain of VISIBILITY\/VISUAL REPRESENTATION is applied to the expression \nof meanings and to the process of enabling others to understand meanings and \ninformation (e.g. \u201cI pointed out to David that these people didn\u2019t really appreciate \ntheir music\u201d); \n\u2022 The source domain of MOVEMENT is applied to the performance of speech acts and to \nthe pursuit of goals via speech (e.g. \u201cMary\u2019s father stepped in with congratulations\u201d); \n\u2022 The source domain of PHYSICAL AGGRESSION is applied to the expression of \ndisagreement and criticism, the attempt to discredit others and their views, and the \nadoption of a forceful, antagonistic attitude in communication (e.g. \u201csniping at the \nBlair style of leadership\u201d, \u201cbombarding with questions\u201d); \n\u2022 The source domain of PHYSICAL PROXIMITY is applied to the expression of agreement \nand solidarity with others and their views (e.g. \u201cAfterwards Mr Milosevic [. . .] \nbacked the proposals\u201d); \n\u2022 The source domain of PHYSICAL PRESSURE is applied to the attempt to achieve \nparticular objectives via speech or to force others to engage in communication (e.g. \n\u201cthe Mirror continued to press him over [. . .]\u201d); \n\u2022 The source domain of PHYSICAL SUPPORT is applied to the expression of agreement \nand solidarity with others and their views or proposals (e.g. \u201cMr Milosevic supported \nthe plan then\u201d). \n \nIn his work on complex target domains such as friendship and happiness, K\u00f6vecses (2000: \n87ff.; 2002: 84ff.) similarly found that they are structured by a set of source domains with \na very wide metaphorical scope, each applying to a particular aspect of the relevant \nemotion concept.2 \n \nMy findings can also be expressed in terms of Grady\u2019s notion of \u201cprimary metaphors\u201d, \nwhich are defined as simple, basic mappings that (i) have a strong experiential basis, (ii) \nmotivate metaphorical expressions that can be applied to different domains of experience, \nand (iii) combine to produce many different complex metaphors (see Grady 1997, 1999). \nFor example, the primary metaphor \u201cHELP IS SUPPORT\u201d can explain the metaphorical use \nof the verb \u201csupport\u201d in relation to communication (as in \u201cMr Milosevic supported the \nplan then\u201d) and in relation to other contexts (as in \u201cOur work in the African continent \n[. . .] is supported by Tear Fund\u201d, from the BNC). Similarly, the primary metaphor \n\u201cDAMAGE IS PHYSICAL HARM\u201d can be said to underlie the metaphorical use of the verb \n\u201cattack\u201d in relation to communication (as in \u201cDelors attacked Balladur\u2019s idea of a \n\u201cEurope of Circles\u201d\u201d) and in relation to many other contexts (as in \u201cthe infection attacks \n 4\nthe lymphatic system\u201d, from the BNC). Within this perspective, a large part of my data \ncan be explained in terms of a range primary metaphors that are not specific to \ncommunication in particular, but which combine to form \u201ccomplex\u201d metaphors for \ncommunication (e.g. \u201cANTAGONISTIC COMMUNICATION IS PHYSICAL AGGRESSION\u201d). At the \nend of the paper I will show how these metaphors, although not always compatible with \neach other, can be combined to form a single overall conceptualization of spoken \ncommunication in terms of a physical scenario; within this scenario, interactants can \nstand in different positions, move in different directions, come into physical contact or \nconflict in different ways, construct their utterances\/speech acts, pass their \nutterances\/speech acts on to others, or make meanings visible to others in different ways. \n \nThese two approaches to the analysis of my data (i.e. via a set of wide-scope source \ndomains or via a set of primary metaphors) are not at all incompatible with each other. \nIndeed, K\u00f6vecses (2002: 109ff.) argues that each wide-scope source domain has a \u201cmajor \ntheme\u201d or \u201cmain meaning focus\u201d, which he describes as \u201cthe culturally agreed-on \nconceptual material associated with the source that it conventionally imparts to its \ntargets\u201d (K\u00f6vecses 2002: 118). The main meaning focus of each source domain gives rise \nto small number of \u201ccentral mappings\u201d, whereby its most culturally salient and distinctive \naspects structure some aspects of a wide variety of target domains (K\u00f6vecses 2002: 110-\n12). K\u00f6vecses explains that these central mappings can be seen as \u201csimple\u201d conceptual \nmetaphors that combine to form \u201ccomplex\u201d conceptual metaphors, and explicitly equates \nthese simple metaphors\/central mappings with Grady\u2019s primary metaphors (K\u00f6vecses \n2002: 111). In evaluating this equivalence, it is important to note that Grady and \nK\u00f6vecses adopt slightly different criteria and methods for determining simple\/primary \nmetaphors: K\u00f6vecses tends to start from large, wide-scope source domains (e.g. FIRE), \nfrom  which he derives \u201csimple\u201d metaphors (e.g. \u201cTHE HIGHEST DEGREE OF INTENSITY IS \nTHE HIGHEST DEGREE OF HEAT\u201d and \u201cCHANGE OF INTENSITY IS CHANGE OF HEAT\u201d); in \ncontrast, Grady tends to start from patterns of metaphorical expressions that apply to a \nwide range of target domains (e.g. \u201cTrading has really heated up this week\u201d, \u201cThings \nhave cooled down at the paper since the election\u201d, Grady 1997: 290) in order to arrive at \n\u201cprimary\u201d metaphors (e.g. \u201cINTENSITY OF ACTIVITY IS HEAT\u201d). As a consequence of these \nmethodological differences, the two approaches may not always arrive at exactly the \nsame conclusions, but K\u00f6vecses (2002: 110-12) does show significant convergence of \nresults in a number of cases. \n \nFor the purposes of this paper, I will divide my analysis into sections on the basis of the \nmost prominent source domains listed above, since this affords a useful overall view of \nthe main general patterns I have found in my data. However, in explaining specific \ngroups of examples, I will mostly refer to primary metaphors, for two main reasons: first, \nmy \u201cbottom-up\u201d methodology is particularly compatible with Grady\u2019s approach; second, \na considerable part of my data can be best accounted for in terms of some of the primary \nmetaphors Grady has already proposed (Grady 1997, 1998), even though he did not \nalways explicitly mention their relevance to the domain of (spoken) communication. As I \ngo along, I will also point out how many relevant source domains have an image-\nschematic basis (see Pauwels and Simon-Vanderbergen 1995 for a detailed discussion), \nwhich also supports the overall claim that the complex domain of speech activity is \n 5\nprimarily constructed in terms of a relatively small set of basic, \u201cmulti-purpose\u201d \nmappings. \n \nTHE DATA \n \nMy data was extracted from a corpus that was constructed and annotated for speech, \nwriting, and thought presentation (hereafter SW&TP) by a team working at Lancaster \nUniversity in the 1990s (see Wynne et al. 1998, Semino et al. 1999, Semino and Short \n2004). It contains 120 text samples of approximately 2,000 words each, amounting to a \ntotal of 258,348 words of (late) 20th century written British English. The corpus is equally \ndivided into three main genre sections: prose fiction (87,709 words); newspaper news \nreports (83,603 words); and biography and autobiography (87,036 words). The genres \nwere selected as prime examples of fictional and non-fictional narrative text-types, since \nthe presentation of others\u2019 words and thoughts is particularly central, although not \nexclusive to, narrative texts. Each of the three genre sections is in turn equally divided \ninto a \u201cserious\u201d and a \u201cpopular\u201d sub-section. For example, in the newspaper section of \nthe corpus, half the samples are taken from broadsheet newspapers and half from tabloid \nnewspapers. For the other two genres, a number of criteria were applied in order to \ninclude equal amounts of extracts from popular as opposed to serious books (see Semino \net al. 1999 and Semino and Short 2004: 19ff. for our criteria in implementing these \ndistinctions). \n \nThe corpus was manually annotated for categories of SW&TP, such as Direct Speech, \nFree Indirect Thought, and so on. I do not have the space here to describe the annotation \nsystem we applied to the corpus (but see Wynne et al. 1998 and Semino and Short 2004: \n26ff. for a detailed discussion). What is relevant for the purposes of this paper is that the \navailability of an annotated corpus makes it possible to obtain concordances for each of \nthe categories of SW&TP included within the annotation system. Here I will focus on \ntwo particular textual phenomena that were captured by our annotation system, namely \nthe speech presentation category known as the \u201cNarrator\u2019s Representation of Speech \nActs\u201d (NRSA), and speech reporting clauses. \n \nThe NRSA category, which was originally introduced in Leech and Short (1981), \ncaptures those expressions which report one or more utterances by referring to their \n(supposed) illocutionary force or speech act value. The following is a prototypical \nexample from the newspaper section of the corpus: \n \n1. At one point during negotiations, [. . .] he demanded a helicopter (The Daily \nTelegraph, 29\/4\/1996) \n \nNRSAs typically include a verb referring to a speech act (e.g. demand in example 1), and \na noun phrase or prepositional phrase providing an indication of the content of the \nrelevant utterance (e.g. a helicopter in example 1). NRSAs can also be realized by noun \nphrases where the head noun refer to a speech act (e.g. demands for tighter gun controls).  \n \n 6\nIn practice, the scope of the NRSA tag also includes some expressions that do not refer to \nspeech act values in the strictest sense, but to speech activity more generally. The use of \nthe verbs \u201cattack\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d in expressions such as \u201cDelors attacked Balladur\u2019s idea \nof \u2026\u201d and \u201cMr Milosevic supported the plan then\u201d, for example, cannot be easily \naccommodated within classifications that are based on a strict definition of (verbs \nreferring to) illocutionary force (e.g. (Austin 1962, Searle 1979, Bach and Harnish 1979). \nExpressions such as these can, however, be accounted for within Ballmer and \nBrennenstuhl\u2019s (1981) Speech Act Classification, which includes \u201cany kind of (aspect of) \nspeech activity designating verb\u201d, for a total of 4,800 expressions (Ballmer and \nBrennenstuhl 1981: 16). This, they argue, results in \u201ca more relevant class of expressions \nwith respect to linguistic behaviour than the \u2018performative\u2019 verbs\u201d (Ballmer and \nBrennenstuhl 1981: 16). \n \nThe main formal criterion for the application of the NRSA tag was that there was no \ngrammatical separation between a reporting clause and a reported clause, since this \nstructure is typical of the category of Indirect Speech presentation (e.g. The Indirect \nSpeech tag was applied to examples such as the second half of the sentence: Hundreds of \nprotesters and politicians gathered in central Moscow, demanding that Russia halt the \ninvasion.) (see Semino and Short 2004: 52-3 for more detail). \n \nAs far as speech reporting clauses are concerned, it is well known that they are normally \nused to introduce stretches of Direct Speech (e.g. She said in She said: \u201cNo\u201d) or Indirect \nSpeech (e.g. Labour claimed in Labour claimed that it had recruited another high profile \nConservative MP). They typically include a reference to the relevant speaker(s) and a \nverb referring to speech activity (e.g. \u201csay\u201d, \u201cclaim\u201d, etc.). However, the same \nintroductory function can be performed by non-clausal structures, such as According to \none senior officer or calls by IRA hardliners to [. . .]. We therefore used the tag NRS \n(\u201cNarrator\u2019s Report of Speech\u201d) to annotate all the stretches of text that perform the \nfunction of introducing stretches of Direct Speech, Indirect Speech (and, in a few cases, \nFree Indirect Speech), regardless of their grammatical structure (see Semino and Short \n2004: 35ff; see also Halliday 1994: 263 and Thompson 1996: 518 et passim). Although \nthe examples I will discuss below are all clausal in structure, I will continue to use the \nacronym NRS, for consistency and ease of reference. \n \nTogether, NRSs and NRSAs capture the vast majority of references to speech activity in \nthe corpus. My analysis in this paper is based on concordances containing 2,563 instances \nof NRS and 985 instances of NRSA respectively (NB: the latter figure is lower than the \ntotal figure for NRSA in the corpus given in Semino and Short (2004: 67), since I have \nexcluded all borderline and embedded cases of NRSA. The same strategy was applied to \nthe concordancing of NRSs). In analyzing the concordances, I regarded individual \ninstances of NRS\/NRSA as metaphorical when: \n(i) one or more of the lexical items that, in context, refer to speech activity have a \nmore basic current sense that is not to do with verbal communication, and   \n(ii) the speech activity sense of the relevant expressions can be said to be motivated \nby the more basic sense via a cross-domain mapping where the target is speech \nactivity and the source is a different domain.  \n 7\nThe emphasis on current basic senses in the first criterion above means that I do not \ninclude etymological metaphors (e.g. verbs such as \u201cinsist\u201d, \u201cpropose\u201d, \u201cexpress\u201d; see, \nfor example, Sweetser 1987, Traugot and Dasher 2002). However, in her diachronic \nstudy of metaphors for thought and speech, Sweetser (1987) found that the same \nunderlying metaphorical mappings were \u201cboth synchronically lively and diachronically \nimportant in past meaning shifts\u201d (Sweetser 1987: 455; emphasis in original). Although I \nwill not be able to deal with this issue, my own data supports this general observation. \n \nConsider the following example of NRSA from the corpus: \n \n2. The Americans [. . .] were now bombarding the security man at the front gate with \nquestions about just which building was the actual home of the Benny Hill Show \n(Smith, J. The Benny Hill Story, 1988, p. 96) \n \nIn (2) the verb \u201cbombard\u201d is used to describe the way in which a group of American \ntourists asked a security man questions about the location of the studio in which English \ncomedian Benny Hill records his show. However, the verb \u201cbombard\u201d has a more basic \nsense that is not to do with verbal communication, but with the dropping of bombs, \ntypically on military targets. The speech activity sense of \u201cbombard\u201d (which is \nconventional in English) can be explained in term of a mapping from the domain \ntypically associated with the basic sense of \u201cbombard\u201d (WAR or, more generally, ARMED \nPHYSICAL AGGRESSION) to the domain of verbal communication. This explains why the use \nof \u201cbombard\u201d in reference to asking questions suggests a persistent, forceful and possibly \naggressive attitude. I will return to this example below. \n \nAccording to my analysis, 249 instances of NRS out of the total 2,563 examples in the \nconcordance involve metaphorical references to speech activity, amounting to \napproximately 10 per cent of the total. For NRSA, I analysed as metaphorical 214 out of \nthe total 985 instances included in the relevant concordance, amounting to approximately \n22 per cent of the total. The fact that the proportion of metaphorical examples is lower for \nNRS than for NRSA is largely due to the preponderance of the verb \u201csay\u201d in speech \nreporting clauses. Overall, therefore, my claims in the rest of this paper are based on the \nanalysis of 463 authentic metaphorical references to speech activity in a balanced corpus \nof written British English. \n \nThe use of corpus data does not, of course, necessarily lead to findings that could not \nhave been arrived at via other methods. However, corpora enable researchers to study \nnaturally-occurring linguistic patterns on a large scale, and therefore tend to provide a \ngreater number and variety of examples than can be generated by intuition or by the \nanalysis of small amounts of data. As a consequence, by adopting a corpus methodology, \nI aim to place my claims about possible underlying conceptual metaphors on a firm and \nexplicit empirical footing. This will hopefully partly address the concerns expressed in \nseveral recent studies about the lack of a rigorous and explicit methodology, within \ncognitive metaphor theory, for extrapolating conceptual metaphors from linguistic data \n(e.g. Cameron 1999, 2003: 239-41; Low 1999, 2003; Ritchie 2003, Steen 1999).  \n \n 8\nANALYSIS \n \nI will present my findings by considering in turn each of the main patterns of \nmetaphorical expressions in my data and the source domains they relate to. The ordering \nof the various sub-section is not based on frequency, however, but on the role played by \neach source domain in the overall metaphorical scenario that I briefly sketched out above \nand that I will present in detail at the end of the paper. I will therefore begin by \ndiscussing expressions that metaphorically present speech activity in terms of motion, \nand then go on to consider expressions relating to physical proximity, physical pressure, \nphysical aggression, physical construction, transfer (of objects), and visibility. As will \nbecome clear in the course of the discussion, the distinctions between patterns that are \ndiscussed in different sections are often not clear-cur, as individual expressions may \nevoke more than one potential source domain, and the same conceptual material can \nsometimes be subsumed under different source domains.  \n \n \n \nExpressions relating to movement \nA number of studies have shown that, in English, communication is often metaphorically \nconstructed in terms of motion in space, both synchronically and diachronically (e.g. \nSweetser 1987, Emanatian 1997, Traugot and Dasher 2002: 190ff., K\u00f6vecses 2002: 80). \nIn my data, 35 instances of NRS\/NRSA contain expressions that have physical senses \nrelating to movement. As noted in other studies, however (e.g. Sweetser 1987, Vanparys \n1995: 26-28), there is considerable variation in the nature of the movement involved, \nparticularly with respect to the entity that is presented as moving, the space where \nmovement takes place, and the destination of the movement. \n \nMovement towards a speech act or the interaction  \nIn the examples below, the action of taking a turn in conversation or of producing a \nspeech act that others have already produced in the same context is metaphorically \nexpressed in terms of physical approach:  \n \n3. John Major also joined the condolences in a message to Mr Howard. (The \nIndependent, 29\/4\/1996) \n4. Mary\u2019s father stepped in with congratulations. (A. Huxley, Point Counter Point, \n1928, p. 139) \n \nThe verb \u201cjoin\u201d has a basic physical sense relating to moving physical entities towards \neach other so that they touch or become connected. It also has a more specific physical \nsense relating to moving towards other people, in order to do things together or to foster \nemotional intimacy (e.g. I sat down and Katrina soon joined me again, from the BNC). \nThis motivates the conventional metaphorical use of \u201cjoin\u201d to indicate the act of \nbecoming a member of an organization or a group (e.g. \u201cI joined Amnesty in 1968\u201d, from \nthe BNC). In example (3), however, the verb \u201cjoin\u201d is followed by a direct object \nindicating a speech act (the condolences). Hence John Major\u2019s performance of a speech \nact that others have already performed in a particular context is metaphorically \n 9\nconstructed in terms of movement towards the speech act. It could also be argued that \n\u201cthe condolences\u201d refers metonymically to those who have already publicly expressed \ntheir condolences, which would bring this particular use of the verb closer to the most \nconventional metaphorical sense to do with becoming part of a group.  \n \nThe metaphorical use of \u201cjoin\u201d in example (3) can be explained in more than one way. If \nwe start from the physical sense of \u201cjoin\u201d that relates to goal-directed movement,  we can \nsee uses such as (3) as instantiations of the primary metaphors \u201cACTION IS SELF-\nPROPELLED MOTION\u201d (e.g. \u201cI\u2019ve got to start moving on this project\u201d; Grady 1997: 287) \nand \u201cACHIEVING A PURPOSE IS ARRIVING AT A DESTINATION\u201d (e.g. \u201cHe\u2019ll ultimately be \nsuccessful, but he\u2019s not there yet\u201d; Grady 1997: 286; see also \u201cPURPOSES ARE \nDESTINATIONS\u201d in Lakoff and Johnson 1999: 52-3). These metaphors, Grady argues, are \nexperientially grounded in correlations between, respectively, \u201cperforming an action and \nmoving\u201d and \u201cachieving a purpose and moving to a spatial location\u201d (Grady 1997: 286-\n87). These particular metaphors are also clearly relevant to example (4), where the action \nof performing a speech act is metaphorically presented, via the verb \u201cstep in\u201d, in terms of \nmovement into a location. In other words, in (4) the interaction between the characters is \nconstructed as a physical space, so that taking a turn in a conversation corresponds to \nentering this physical space.  \n \nAnother possible explanation for example (3) focuses on the fact that the particular kind \nof movement evoked by \u201cjoin\u201d results in physical proximity. From this point of view, \nexamples such as (3) can be related to other expressions that construct agreement and \nsolidarity in terms of physical proximity, such as \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll \nside with him every time\u201d, which Grady (1997: 297) explains via the primary metaphor \n\u201cAGREEMENT\/ SOLIDARITY IS BEING ON THE SAME SIDE\u201d. In example (3), however, it is a \ncommonality of (expressed) feeling, attitude and purpose that is partly constructed as \nphysical proximity. I will return this example in the section where I discuss other \nexpressions that construct spoken communication in terms of physical proximity among \nparticipants. \n \nMovement towards or away from the goal of communication \nSome metaphorical NRSAs contain expressions in which speech activity is constructed in \nterms of movement along a path towards or away from a destination. Consider the \nexamples below: \n \n5. \u201cNo, don\u2019t misunderstand me,\u201d Constance went on. \u201cI was thinking more of \nmyself than her. [\u2026]\u201d  \n6. Yesterday Mr Haigh [. . .] back tracked a little (The News of the World, 11\/12\/94) \n \nIn example (5) the reporting clause (NRS) includes a highly conventional metaphorical \nuse of the phrasal verb \u201cgo on\u201d to refer to the act of resuming talk or continuing to talk. \nThe verb \u201cgo on\u201d is of course conventionally used to refer metaphorically to the \ncontinuation of any process, action or behaviour (e.g. \u201cGoldberg went on typing\u201d, from \nthe BNC). This can be explained in terms of the primary metaphors \u201cAN EVENT IS THE \nMOTION OF AN OBJECT\u201d (e.g. \u201cThe concert went until 4 o\u2019clock\u201d; Grady 1997: 286) and \n 10\n\u201cACTION IS SELF-PROPELLED MOTION\u201d  which apply generally to events and human \nactivities. Examples such as (5) show that the latter metaphor also applies to speech \nactivity in particular. \nExample (6) is an instance of a highly conventional metaphorical use of the verb \u201cback \ntrack\u201d to indicate the expression of different and\/or weaker views than previously \nexpressed. As suggested earlier, the primary metaphor \u201cACHIEVING A PURPOSE IS ARRIVING \nAT A DESTINATION\u201d also applies to conversational purposes. Indeed, English has a number \nof conventional expressions whereby (successful) communication (or, more precisely, the \nsuccessful verbal expression of one\u2019s thoughts or feelings) is constructed in terms of \nforward movement towards a destination, as in the following extract from the BNC: \n\u201cHerr Nordern said \u2018Get to the point can\u2019t you.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m getting there\u2019, Bodo said.\u201d. Here \nthe most relevant topic or piece information is presented as the end point of motion along \na path. In this context, it is therefore possible to explain how, in examples such as (6), \nmoving backward corresponds to verbally declaring a (partial) change of mind.  \nA more extended realization of \u201cACHIEVING A PURPOSE IS ARRIVING AT A DESTINATION\u201d in \nthe context of speech activity is given below: \n \n7. Bunty still has to run through all our names until she reaches mine  (Atkinsons, K. \nBehind the Scenes at the Museum, 1995, p. 280) \n \nHere the first-person narrator, who is the youngest child in her family, talks about how \nher mother (Bunty) mistakenly says the names of all her other children before finally \nsaying the narrator\u2019s own name. This process is metaphorically presented, via the phrasal \nverb \u201crun through\u201d, as rapid movement in space. Here the path along which the \nmovement occurs corresponds to the list of children\u2019s names, and the destination is the \nintended linguistic expression (in this case, the narrator\u2019s own name).  \n \nMovement without a destination \nAll of the expressions I have considered so far in this section present speech activity in \nterms of intentional, goal-directed motion. This is not the case, however, in the examples \nbelow: \n \n8. friends started deserting her as word spread that Ariel had died of Aids. (Today, \n5\/12\/1994) \n9. In October 1988 stories began circulating that Kylie had been the victim of a \ncrazed sex-attacker. (Stone, S. Kylie Minogue: The Superstar Next Door, 1990, p. \n57)  \n \nIn both examples reference is made to a process whereby an unspecified number of \nindividuals told others about sensitive private information about a particular person, so \nthat, eventually, many people knew about it. In both cases this is presented, from the \npoint of view of the person in question, as apparently uncontrollable and undirected \nmovement on the part of the utterances\/texts themselves (\u201cword\u201d, \u201cstories\u201d): the verb \n\u201cspread\u201d has a physical sense to do with substances (such as liquid) moving outwards in \n 11\nall directions to cover a large area, while \u201ccirculate\u201d has a physical sense to do with \nentities or substances (such as air) moving around continuously within an enclosed space. \nIt is therefore important to note that, while the other types of expressions discussed above \ncan all be related to the basic PATH image schema, here metaphorical motion does not \ntake place along a path, but outwards from a central point in the case of \u201cspread\u201d and \ncyclically within a particular space in the case of \u201ccirculate\u201d.  In both cases, the relevant \nphysical movement is normally unintentional and hard to control, and, in both cases, the \nverbs in question have related metaphorical uses that are not to do with speech activity \n(e.g. \u201cThis problem has spread to the UK\u201d , \u201cEven then, Jobs predicts, illegal copies will \ncirculate\u201d, from the BNC). While expressions such as these can be related to primary \nmetaphors such as Grady\u2019s (1997: 186) \u201cCHANGE IS MOTION\u201d and \u201cAN EVENT IS THE \nMOTION OF AN OBJECT\u201d, they also seem to suggest a more specific metaphorical \nconceptualization of uncontrollable, harmful events or behaviour in terms of the \nuncontrollable movement of entities or substances.  \n \nOverall, the expressions I have analysed in this section account for 7.5 per cent of all \nmetaphorical instances of NRS\/NRSA in my data. They all suggest a conceptualization of \nspoken communication in terms of motion in space, but, as I have shown, they differ \nsignificantly in terms of the precise nature of that motion and the kind of speech activity \nit is metaphorically applied to. Hence, I have explained them in terms of (a small set of) \ndifferent primary metaphors.  \n \nExpressions relating to physical proximity \nNine metaphorical NRSAs in my data (i.e. approximately four per cent of all my \nmetaphorical NRSAs) include expressions whose physical senses are to do with physical \nproximity without contact. Most of these expressions involve metaphorical uses of the \nverbs \u201cback\u201d and \u201cstand by\u201d as in the extracts below: \n \n10. Afterwards Mr Milosevic [. . .] backed the proposals (The Daily Telegraph, \n5\/12\/1994) \n11. A vicar who told his congregation \u201cSanta\u2019s a fake\u201d stood by his words yesterday. \n(The Daily Express, 12\/12\/1994) \n \nThe verb \u201cback\u201d has a number of physical senses, the most relevant of which indicates \nthat an entity is positioned (closely) behind another. The verb \u201cstand by\u201d is similar, \nexcept for the fact that it indicates standing beside rather than standing behind. Both \nverbs also have several conventional metaphorical senses, including that of providing  \nassistance, or being ready to provide assistance, in a number of non-physical, generally \nsocial, contexts (e.g. \u201cOur Home Care teams are made up of doctors and nurses backed \nby a network of trained and active volunteers\u201d, and \u201cIn Hindu families, therefore, often \nthe women members stand by each other in times of stress and distress\u201d, from the BNC). \nExamples such as (10) and (11) show how the metaphorical use of these verbs also \napplies to communicative interaction (whether the relevant entity is another person, a \nparticular view, a previous utterance, the contents of a text, and so on).  \n \n 12\nThese examples can be broadly explained with reference to image schemata such as \nCENTRE-PERIPHERY and NEAR-FAR (Johnson 1987: 124-5). More specifically, they can be \nrelated to other types of expressions that Grady (1997) accounts for by means of primary \nmetaphors. \u201cEMOTIONAL INTIMACY IS PROXIMITY\u201d is proposed by Grady in order to explain \nexpressions such as \u201cMy sister and I are very close\u201d (Grady 1997: 293). Here the \nexperiential motivation lies in the correlation between being emotionally intimate with \nsomeone and being physically close to them (see also \u201cINTIMACY IS CLOSENESS\u201d in Lakoff \nand Johnson 1980: 52). This metaphor could explain some metaphorical uses of \u201cstand \nby\u201d in particular, but does not fully explain examples such as (10) and (11). Another \npotentially relevant primary metaphor is \u201cAGREEMENT\/SOLIDARITY IS BEING ON THE SAME \nSIDE\u201d, which, as I mentioned earlier, Grady proposes on the basis of linguistic \nexpressions such as \u201cI\u2019ll side with him every time\u201d (Grady 1997: 297). The expressions \nin my examples, however, evoke physical proximity generally, rather than specifically  \nbeing on the same side, and, as I have mentioned, also have conventional metaphorical \nsenses that relate to (potential) assistance generally rather than agreement in particular. \nThis could be accounted for by a more general metaphor along the lines of \nAGREEMENT\/SOLIDARITY\/(POTENTIAL) ASSISTANCE IS PHYSICAL PROXIMITY, which could \nin fact also explain the use of \u201cjoin\u201d in example (3) above. \n \nExpressions relating to physical support  \nThe corpus contains four NRSAs in which speech activity is metaphorically referred to \nby means of the word \u201csupport\u201d, used either as a verb or as a noun. An example is given \nbelow:  \n \n12. Mr Milosevic supported the plan then, but made little headway in persuading the \nBosnian Serbs. (The Independent, 5 December 1994) \n \nHere \u201csupported\u201d does not just refer to Milosevic\u2019s positive attitude towards the referent \nof \u201cthe plan\u201d, but also to the expression of a positive attitude, which was essential to the \nrealization of the plan in question. A similar use of \u201csupport\u201d in relation to written \ncommunication is given below: \n \n13. Yet six months earlier he supported the very same regime in a letter to a fellow \nMP. (Today, 5\/12\/1994) \n \nIn its physical sense, the verb \u201csupport\u201d indicates that an entity prevents another from \nfalling via physical contact and mutual physical position. As I mentioned earlier, \n\u201csupport\u201d (both as a verb and as a noun) also has a wide range of conventional \nmetaphorical senses: we conventionally talk about \u201cmoral support\u201d, \u201cfinancial support\u201d, \n\u201cpolitical support\u201d, and so on. Grady (1997: 283) explains such conventional \nmetaphorical senses by proposing the primary metaphor \u201cASSISTANCE IS SUPPORT\u201d, which, \nhe argues, has its  experiential motivation in the correlation between physical support and \nthe continued functionality or viability of physical objects (indeed, Grady (1997: 282) \nsees \u201cASSISTANCE IS SUPPORT\u201d as a corollary of \u201cFUNCTIONALITY\/VIABILITY IS ERECTNESS\u201d, \nwhich gives rise to expressions such as \u201cThat record still stands\u201d; see also \u201cHELP IS \nSUPPORT\u201d in Lakoff and Johnson 1999: 52). Grady\u2019s linguistic examples of \u201cASSISTANCE \n 13\nIS SUPPORT\u201d do not relate specifically to verbal communication, but to social relations \nmore generally: \u201cOur conservation program needs your support\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve really been \nleaning on my friends the past few months\u201d (Grady 1997: 283). Examples such as (12) \nand (13) show that the same primary metaphor can also explain the use of words such as \n\u201csupport\u201d to indicate the verbal expression of a favourable attitude towards someone or \nsomething, which, in context, may result in the relevant entity achieving its goals, coming \ninto being, continuing to exist, and so on. As is the case with the primary metaphors \ndiscussed in the previous sections, it is possible to argue that \u201cASSISTANCE IS SUPPORT\u201d  \nhas an image-schematic basis, particularly with reference to the CONTACT and BALANCE \nimage schemata (Johnson 1987). \n \nExpressions relating to physical pressure  \nEight of the metaphorical NRS\/NRSAs in my data evoke a physical scenario where an \nagent (corresponding to the speaker) comes into contact with another entity (normally \ncorresponding to the addressee) and exercises physical pressure on it. Consider the \nexamples below: \n \n14. when the Mirror continued to press him over the stabbing of estranged wife \nNicole (The Daily Mirror, 13\/5\/96) \n15. The UN\u2019s military commanders, led by General Sir Michael Rose, have pressed \nfor an end to Nato\u2019s aerial presence over Bosnia (The Independent on Sunday, \n4\/12\/1994) \n \nIn its most relevant physical sense, the verb \u201cpress\u201d is to do with physically pushing \nagainst another entity. In the above examples, the notion of physical pressure is \nmetaphorically mapped onto that of using language in order to get others to do something \nthat they may not otherwise do, and\/or that they may be reluctant to do. In (14), the direct \nobject of \u201cpress\u201d (him) refers to the addressee (O. J. Simpson), and the goal is to get him \nto respond to the allegation that he killed his wife. In (15) object of the the phrasal verb \n\u201cpress for\u201d (an end to Nato\u2019s aerial presence over Bosnia) refers to the speakers\u2019 ultimate \ngoal, and implicitly reveals the addressee on whom the pressure is exercised (Nato, or \nmore precisely, the countries participating in a Nato-led campaign in Bosnia).  \n \nExpressions evoking the notion of physical pressure have a wide range of related  \nconventional metaphorical uses that go well beyond the target domain of communication. \nFor example, we commonly talk of \u201cpeer pressure\u201d, \u201cmoral pressure\u201d, \u201cwork pressure\u201d, \nand so on. All these expressions can be explained with reference to Grady\u2019s primary \nmetaphor \u201cCOMPULSION IS A COMPELLING FORCE\u201d (Grady 1997: 287). Of the two \nlinguistic examples that Grady provides for this particular metaphor, one does not relate \nto communication (\u201cVanity finally drove me to have the operation\u201d), but the other is to \ndo with the exercising of influence over somebody else\u2019s behaviour via speech (\u201cMy \nfriends pushed me into volunteering\u201d). Grady identifies the experiential basis of \n\u201cCOMPULSION IS A COMPELLING FORCE\u201d in \u201cthe correlation between deliberate action and \nmotion through space\u201d (which is also captured by the COMPULSION image schema; see \n 14\nJohnson 1987: 41ff., Sweetser 1990: 69ff.). In other words, we know from our basic \nphysical experience that others can affect our movements in space by pushing against us, \nor, conversely, that we can affect others\u2019 physical movement in space by pushing against \nthem. This experience is mapped onto more general and less physical experiences where \npeople use a variety of strategies (including verbal strategies) in order to get others to act \nin ways that they may not want to.  \n \nMy concordance contains only eight examples of this kind, amounting to approximately 2 \nper cent of all metaphorical examples in my data. The four expressions involving \n\u201csupport\u201d discussed in the previous section also represent a very small proportion of the \nmetaphorical references to speech activity I have analysed (2 per cent of metaphorical \nNRSAs and 1 per cent of all metaphorical NRS\/NRSAs combined). However, as I have  \nexplained, both sets of examples are part of much larger patterns whereby assistance of \nmany kinds is metaphorically constructed in terms of physical support, and compulsion \nof many kinds is metaphorically presented in terms of a physical force exercising \npressure. Indeed, since both physical support and physical pressure involve physical \ncontact between entities, these two patterns can be seen as part of the same conceptual \nscenario, in which physical contact with pressure corresponds to the verbal exercise of \ncompulsion, while physical contact without pressure corresponds to the verbal provision \nof assistance.  \n \nExpressions relating to physical aggression  \nIn Metaphors We Live By, Lakoff and Johnson (1980) discuss a range common linguistic \nexpressions relating to arguments, such as \u201cYour claims are indefensible\u201d, \u201cHis criticism \nwere right on target\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve never won an argument with him\u201d. They conclude that \n\u201cARGUMENT is partially structured, understood, performed, and talked about in terms of \nWAR\u201d (Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 5), and therefore propose the well-known conceptual \nmetaphor \u201cARGUMENT IS WAR\u201d. This metaphor, Lakoff and Johnson argue, is based in an \nexperiential correlation between verbal arguments and physical fights, which are \ncommon among animals generally, but which humans  \u201chave institutionalized [. . .] in a \nnumber of ways, one of them being war\u201d (Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 62; see K\u00f6vecses \n2002: 74-5 for a \u201ccultural\u201d account of the experiential basis of this metaphor).  \n \nIn a dictionary-based study of \u201cmetalinguistic metaphors\u201d, Vanparys (1995) has noted, \nhowever, that the English expressions that construct communication in terms of fighting \n\u201cdo not necessarily make reference to a situation of war\u201d, and are therefore best \naccounted for in terms of a more general conceptual metaphor, which he formulates as \n\u201cVERBAL AGGRESSION IS PHYSICAL AGGRESSION\u201d (Vanparys 1995: 31). More recently, \nRitchie (2003) has pointed out that many of the linguistic expressions normally adduced \nas evidence for \u201cARGUMENT IS WAR\u201d can also be associated with other potential source \ndomains, such as sports or games like chess and bridge, and therefore proposes that the \nrelevant source domain is best seen as a complex conceptual field relating to different \ntypes of conflict, ranging from games through fisticuffs to all-out war (Ritchie 2003: 135). \nThis, he suggests, leads to a stronger account of the experiential basis of the conventional \nlinguistics patterns noted by Lakoff and Johnson: although most (American) native \nspeakers of English do not have first-hand experience of war, they do have direct, first-\n 15\nhand experience of many types of less extreme physical conflict, such as physical scuffles \namong children, physical contests, sports and games. Within this perspective, the fact that \nphysical conflict functions as a source domain for verbal conflict has a clear experiential \nbasis in bodily experience from an early age. In my discussion I will show how the \npatterns I have identified in my data are indeed more compatible with Vanparys\u2019s and \nRitchie\u2019s proposals than with the traditional \u201cARGUMENT IS WAR\u201d formulation (see also \nSemino forthcoming).  \n \nThirty-three references to speech activity in my concordances are realized by expressions \nthat metaphorically present verbal conflict in terms of physical aggression. There is some \nvariation however, in the precise nature of the physical conflict that appears to function \nas source. Some expressions are similar to those cited by Lakoff and Johnson as evidence \nfor \u201cARGUMENT IS WAR\u201d.  The use of the verb \u201cbombard\u201d in example (2) above belongs to \nthis group as do the following expressions: \u201cflare\u201d (in \u201cquestions flaring\u201d), \u201cblast\u201d (in \n\u201cblasting Tory claims that \u2026\u201d and \u201cflak\u201d (in \u201cflak over fat cat pay\u201d). Three further \nexamples are given below: \n \n16. amid renewed backbench sniping at the Blair style of leadership (The Guardian, \n13\/5\/1996) \n17. [O]nce again we were firing questions (The Daily Mirror, 13\/5\/1996) \n18. The Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, yesterday stepped up his guerrilla warfare \nagainst the Tory right by insisting that [. . .] (The Guardian, 13\/5\/1996) \n \nClearly, it is possible to see such expressions as linguistic realizations of the conceptual \nmetaphor \u201cARGUMENT IS WAR\u201d. However, closer analysis reveals some difficulties. Only \nsome of these examples refer to the expression of critical views in arguments or \ncontroversies (e.g. \u201cstepped up his guerrilla warfare against the Tory right\u201d), while \nothers refer more generally to persistent and forceful behaviour in spoken communication, \nnot necessarily within an argument as such (e.g. \u201cbombarding with questions\u201d). \nMoreover, the literal senses of these expressions do not just relate to war in the sense of \norganised military conflict among countries, but rather to the wider domain of armed \nviolence, which also includes, for example, the activities of terrorist organisations and of \narmed criminals generally.  \n \nSimilar considerations apply to the use of the verbs \u201cattack\u201d and \u201cdefend\u201d to refer to \nspeech activities, as in the examples below:  \n \n19. Last night M Delors attacked M Balladur\u2019s idea of a \u201cEurope of circles\u201d in which \neach member country could progress at its own speed. (The Daily Telegraph, \n12\/12\/1994) \n20. The Chancellor also defended his stand on a European single currency. (The Daily \nStar, 13\/5\/1996) \n \nAlthough both \u201cattack\u201d and \u201cdefend\u201d can apply literally to the context of war, their literal \nsenses actually relate to physical aggression and violence more generally, as in the \nfollowing examples from the BNC: Police attacked at acid house parties, and Michael \n 16\ntold the Old Bailey he had tried to defend his brother Lee, 13, before his father turned on \nhim.  \n \nMy data also contains a further set of expressions in which speech activity is \nmetaphorically presented in terms of low-level hostile physical action which does not \nnormally involve the use of weapons. Consider the examples below:  \n \n21. But Mr Straw hit back: \u201cThe changes we are talking about do not necessarily spell \nthe end of the monarchy [. . .]\u201d (The Daily Mirror, 5\/12\/1994) \n22. Ex-Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, in a further swipe at Mr Major, said suspending \nthe rebel MPs was silly (The Daily Express, 12\/12\/1994) \n23. Both presenters have been slammed for fluffing their lines (The News of the \nWorld, 11\/12\/1994) \n24. He rapped his decision to remove the whip from eight MPs who voted against the \nEuro-cash bill last week. (The Daily Star, 5\/12\/1994) \n \nIn all four cases the underlined expressions have basic physical senses to do with the \ndelivery of blows against physical entities, including, in some cases, people. While \u201chit\u201d, \n\u201cswipe\u201d and \u201cslam\u201d may refer to the delivery of one or more blows against someone or \nsomething, the physical sense of \u201crap\u201d involves repeated, if more gentle, blows to an \nobject, or, in a more restricted sense, somebody else\u2019s knuckles (e.g. He told his teacher \nhe had lost it on the way to school, and Mr Watson promptly rapped his knuckles with a \nruler for his carelessness, from the BNC). In all four cases, what is being metaphorically \nreferred to is the verbal expression of negative or critical attitudes towards somebody \nelse\u2019s views, decisions or behaviour. \n \nThe analysis of my data therefore seems to suggest that Lakoff and Johnson\u2019s \nformulation of the conceptual metaphor \u201cARGUMENT IS WAR\u201d is too restricted. As far as \nthe source domain is concerned, the expressions I have presented do not (or not only) \nrelate to the domain of WAR, but to a more general domain, which, following Vanparys \n(1995), I will refer to as PHYSICAL AGGRESSION. This domain includes a large variety of \nforms of aggressive action, from the delivery of blows with one\u2019s bare hands to the \ndeployment of the kind of weaponry that is typically used in armed conflict between \ncountries. As far as the target domain is concerned, many of my examples do refer to \narguments (even though not necessarily in face-to-face communication), but some relate \nmore generally to critical, forceful, or antagonistic communicative behaviour, which may \nnot be part of an argument as such (e.g. \u201cbombarding with questions\u201d and \u201cfiring \nquestions\u201d), or which may not necessarily receive a reply from the addressee (e.g. \u201cBoth \npresenters have been slammed \u2026\u201d in example 23). It may be more appropriate, therefore, \nto regard the expressions discussed in this section as realizations of a general conceptual \nmetaphor which may be referred to as \u201cANTAGONISTIC COMMUNICATION IS PHYSICAL \nAGGRESSION\u201d . This conclusion is broadly compatible with Vanparys\u2019s (1995) and \nRitchie\u2019s (2003) proposals, but does not deny, of course, that war is a salient part of the \ncomplex domain of physical aggression, and that it functions as the specific source of \nsome metaphorical expressions relating to arguments. The problem with the \u201cARGUMENT \nIS WAR\u201d  formulation is that it does not properly account for the linguistic evidence, and \n 17\ntends to force a narrow interpretation of expressions that do not necessarily relate \nspecifically either to (metaphorical) war or to (literal) arguments. \n \nIt needs to be noted, however, that, like \u201cARGUMENT IS WAR\u201d, \u201cANTAGONISTIC \nCOMMUNICATION IS PHYSICAL AGGRESSION\u201d  provides a rather general description of the \nrelevant metaphorical mapping(s). In Grady\u2019s terms, \u201cANTAGONISTIC COMMUNICATION IS \nPHYSICAL AGGRESSION\u201d  is a \u201ccomplex\u201d conceptual metaphor, consisting of the \ncombination of several primary metaphors. Two of the primary metaphors proposed by \nGrady can be seen as particularly relevant here. The first is \u201cOBJECTING IS ATTACKING\u201d  \n(e.g. examples 16, 18, 19, etc.), and the second is \u201cDAMAGE IS PHYSICAL HARM\u201d, which \naccounts specifically for those metaphorical expressions which suggest that the target of \ncritical or forceful verbal action is being physically damaged or destroyed, as in \u201cblasting \nTory claims that \u2026\u201d and other examples above. In K\u00f6vecses\u2019s (2002) terms, these \nprimary metaphors can be seen as the central mappings that result from the main meaning \nfocus of the PHYSICAL AGGRESSION source domain. Some of my examples, however, \nappear to realize a slightly different metaphorical mapping, whereby engaging in \npersistent, unwelcome (communicative) behaviour towards someone else is constructed \nas physical attack. These include particularly \u201cbombarding with questions\u201d and \u201cfiring \nquestions\u201d, as well as, from the receiver\u2019s perspective, expressions such as the following \nfrom the BNC: \u201cWe\u2019re still limited by sexism, but at the same time we\u2019re bombarded with \nimages telling us that we have to achieve a lot\u2019, \u201cThe traveller today is bombarded with \ninformation about travelling\u201d. \n \nWith 33 instances, metaphorical expressions drawing from the source domain of physical \naggression account for approximately seven per cent of all metaphorical NRS\/NRSAs in \nmy two concordances. Not surprisingly, the vast majority of these expressions (27) occur \nin the press section of the corpus, since news reports are often concerned with \ndisagreements and debates on controversial issues, both of a private and of a public \nnature. More importantly, the expressions analysed in this section appear to be coherent \nwith those I discussed in the previous sections: speech activities in interaction are \nmetaphorically constructed on the basis of a physical scenario in which (i) physical \nproximity or physical contact without pressure metaphorically corresponds to a \nfavourable attitude and (potential) assistance, (ii) physical contact with pressure \ncorresponds to the verbal attempt to influence others\u2019 behaviour, and (iii) physical \naggression and violence corresponds to antagonistic communication. This scenario will \nbe further developed in the following sections. \n \nExpressions relating to physical construction \nThe two individual verbs that occur most frequently in my 463 metaphorical references to \nspeech activity are \u201cmake\u201d (30 instances) and \u201cadd\u201d (54 instances). Both verbs have \nphysical senses that broadly relate to the construction of physical objects. \n \nConsider the example below: \n \n25. the producers duly made a plea for more support for the British film industry. \n(The Daily Telegraph, 5\/12\/94) \n 18\n \nThe verb \u201cmake\u201d is highly delexicalised and has a large number of non-physical \nconventional senses (e.g. \u201cmake a wish\u201d, \u201cmake a mistake\u201d, \u201cmake an attempt\u201d, etc.). \nHowever, it is possible to identify a basic, physical sense (i.e. that of physically \nconstructing a concrete object), which can be seen as acting as metaphorical source for  \nnon-physical uses (see also Cameron 2003: 72-3). In extract (25), for example, a \nparticular speech act (a plea) is metaphorically presented as a physical entity that can be \nconstructed in the process of communication. Other similar examples from the corpus \ninclude \u201cmake an appeal\u201d, \u201cmake a statement\u201d, and \u201cmake a disclaimer\u201d. In addition, \nthere are a number of expressions where \u201cmake\u201d is followed by a direct object referring \nto a text-type or utterance-type, rather than a speech act (e.g. \u201cmake a joke\u201d, \u201cmake a \nreport\u201d, \u201cmake a comment\u201d). In other words, the process of verbally producing \nutterances, texts and speech acts is conventionally referred to via the most basic verb in \nEnglish for referring to the physical construction of concrete objects (see also Vanparys \n1995: 14).  \n \nThe verb \u201cadd\u201d is used slightly differently, as can be seen in the examples below: \n \n26. \u201cBut I supposed you\u2019d go on poaching whether you were welcome or not,\u201d she \nadded with a nervous little laugh. (Huxley, A. Point Counter Point, 1928, p. 139) \n27. Mr Straw - who claimed he had the backing of his leader Tony Blair - ominously \nadded that the changes did \u201cnot necessarily spell the end\u201d of royal rule. \n(Independent on Sunday, 4\/12\/1994) \n \nWhile \u201cmake\u201d is mostly used in NRSA constructions, \u201cadd\u201d is used exclusively in \nreporting clauses accompanying Direct Speech (as in example 26) or Indirect Speech (as \nin example 27). In its most basic physical sense, the verb \u201cadd\u201d refers to the process of \nputting an entity or substance together with other entities or substances (e.g. He then \nslices open the fillet to add a langoustine mousse, from the BNC). However, apart from \nits mathematical sense, it is also conventionally used to refer to increases in intensity or \nto the acquisition of extra qualities, as in the following examples from the BNC: Not to \nhave made a will can only add to that stress and Including scented flowers in the display \nadds a special touch. Examples (26) and (27) demonstrate an equally conventional \nmetaphorical sense relating to communication, and particularly to the process of \nresuming talk or saying something similar or relevant to what has been said before.  \n \nAlthough the specific source and target concepts evoked by \u201cmake\u201d and \u201cadd\u201d in my \nexamples are different, I have grouped these expressions together here because in both \ncases the (relatively) abstract and intangible process of communicating meanings is \nmetaphorically constructed as a physical process, whereby objects are made and \nobjects\/substances are added to other objects\/substances. Together, these two verbs are \nused in 18 per cent of all metaphorical NRS\/NRSAs in my data, thereby forming the \nsecond largest group of metaphorical expressions after those relating to transfer, which \nwill be discussed next.  \n \n \n 19\nExpressions relating to transfer \nIn what has become a classic study in cognitive metaphor theory, Reddy (1979) famously \nnoted that, in English, communication is often talked about in terms of the transfer of \nobjects along a conduit (e.g. \u201cYou have to put each concept into words very carefully\u201d \nand \u201cTry to get your thoughts across better\u201d). Reddy labelled  the underlying \nmetaphorical conceptualization of communication \u201cthe conduit metaphor\u201d (see also \nLakoff and Johnson 1980: 10-12 et passim on what they call \u201cthe CONDUIT metaphor\u201d). \nWithin this metaphor, Reddy argued, language \u201cfunctions like a conduit, transferring \nthoughts bodily from one person to another\u201d; speakers and writers \u201cinsert thoughts or \nfeelings in the words\u201d; words containing the thoughts and feelings are transferred to the \naddressee(s); and finally listeners or readers \u201cextract the thoughts and feelings again from \nthe words\u201d (Reddy 1979: 170). Reddy estimated that as many as 70 per cent of the \nexpressions speakers of English commonly use to talk about communication are \ninstantiations of the conduit metaphor. More recently, Grady (1997: 119ff., 1998) re-\nanalysed Reddy\u2019s linguistic data and proposed that the CONDUIT metaphor should be \ndecomposed into a set of primary metaphors, which also motivate many conventional \nmetaphorical expressions that are not to do with communication.  \n \nIn my data, the largest single group of metaphorical NRS\/NRSAs (93 instances) contain \nexpressions of the kind that led Reddy (1979) to propose the CONDUIT metaphor (see also \nSemino forthcoming). Two typical examples are given below: \n \n28. Mr Michael Portillo gave warning yesterday that the Tory right could not be \nunited until \u2026 (The Daily Telegraph, 12\/12\/1994) \n29. Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has delivered a defiant message \nto restless Tory backbenchers \u2026 (The Observer, 13\/5\/1996) \n \nIn their most basic physical senses, the verbs \u201cgive\u201d and \u201cdeliver\u201d are to do with to the \ntransfer of concrete objects in the physical world. Their use in examples such as (28) and \n(29) suggests that the production of texts\/utterances and the performance of speech acts \nare constructed in terms of the transfer of physical objects from one person (the speaker) \nto others (the addressees). The verbs \u201cgive\u201d and \u201cdeliver\u201d are the prototypical and most \nfrequently used examples of this group of metaphorical expressions in my data, but \nseveral other verbs are used metaphorically in the corpus in very similar ways, including:  \n\u201cissue\u201d (e.g. \u201cissue a command\u201d), \u201cleave\u201d (e.g. \u201cleave a message\u201d), \u201coffer\u201d (e.g. \u201coffer \nadvice\u201d), \u201cpass on\u201d(e.g. \u201cpass on news\u201d), \u201csend\u201d (e.g. \u201csend a message\u201d), and \u201cthrow\u201d \n(e.g. \u201cthrow questions\u201d).  \n \nIn Grady\u2019s (1997: 25ff, 1998) terms, all these expressions are realizations of the primary \nmetaphor \u201cTRANSMISSION OF ENERGY IS TRANSFER (OF OBJECTS)\u201d, which, he argues, is \nexperientially grounded in the fact that the communication of meaning literally involves \nphysical transfer of some sort (e.g. acoustic signals in spoken communication, physical \nobjects in traditional written communication, and so on). In the examples discussed by \nReddy and Grady, however, the range of entities that are presented as being transferred in \nexpressions of this kind is restricted to the contents of an utterance\/text (e.g. \u201cgive \nevidence\u201d, \u201cpass on news\u201d) and to what Reddy called \u201cRepertoire Members\u201d (e.g. \u201cgive \n 20\nviews\u201d). In my data, the range of such entities also includes text-types (e.g. \u201csend a \nmessage\u201d, \u201cdeliver a lecture\u201d) and speech acts (e.g. \u201cgive warning\u201d, \u201cissue a \ncommand\u201d). All of these entities are therefore metaphorically constructed as objects that \ncan either be physically transferred from the addresser to the addressee (as in examples \n28 and 29) or made available within the communication space so that they are accessible \nto others (e.g. \u201cissue a command\u201d, \u201cleave a message\u201d). The primary metaphor \n\u201cTRANSMISSION OF ENERGY IS TRANSFER (OF OBJECTS)\u201d therefore also involves a general \nontological metaphors whereby RMs, as well as utterances,  their contents and their \nillocutionary force are constructed as physical entities (but not necessarily as possessions \nin the way suggested by Grady 1997, 1998).  \n \nIn linguistic terms, all the expressions discussed in this section are light-verb \nconstructions involving conventional metaphorical uses of verbs that are delexicalised to \nvarying degrees. As a consequence, some of these verbs can be used more or less \ninterchangeably. For example, \u201cgive\u201d and \u201cdeliver\u201d can be used interchangeably with \ndirect objects such as \u201cmessage\u201d, while \u201cgive\u201d and \u201cissue\u201d can be used interchangeably \nwith direct objects such as \u201corder\u201d. In spite of their delexicalised status, however, I have \nanalysed these verbs as metaphorically used in my data because it is possible in each case \nto identify a basic, physical sense which can function as source for the conventional \nmetaphorical senses to do with communication (see Cameron 2003: 72-3). Indeed, where \nthe various \u201ctransfer\u201d verbs cannot be used interchangeably, the reason seems to lie in the \nresidual influence of their basic physical senses (e.g. \u201ca message\u201d can function as direct \nobject of \u201cgive\u201d and \u201cdeliver\u201d but is not normally used as direct object of \u201cissue\u201d).  \n \nThe group of examples I classified under the general notion of transfer also includes \nexpressions such as the following: \n \n30. A master asked him on one occasion whether a word was nominative or dative, \nand back came his answer: \u201cI don\u2019t really care, sir!\u201d (Callow, S. Vincent Van \nGogh - A Life, 1990, p. 66) \n31. He admitted that Labour wanted to reduce the Queen\u2019s powers over Parliament \n(The Daily Express, 5\/12\/1994) \n \nIn example (30) an (impertinent) reply to a question is metaphorically presented in terms \nof movement back towards the previous speaker. Unlike what I noted in my earlier \ndiscussion of expressions to do with motion, therefore, in examples such as (30) \nconversational exchanges are constructed in terms of an exchange of physical objects \nbetween the addresser and the addressee back and forth along a conduit. A similar \nargument can be made about the use of \u201cadmit\u201d in example (31), since the verb still \nretains the meaning of letting someone or something into a particular space, as in the \nfollowing examples from the BNC: These gaps admit draughts and dust from the \nunderfloor void and Do not even admit someone claiming to be a policeman or woman.  \nIn examples such as (31) the notion of letting someone or something into a physical space \nis mapped onto that of (verbally) acknowledging as true something that may be \ndetrimental to one\u2019s own case and that has usually been said by opponents in an argument. \nSweetser (1987) also mentions \u201cadmit\u201d as an example of a verb of Latin origin where the \n 21\nprefix \u201cad-\u201d (\u201c(in)to\u201d) suggests movement from the speaker to the addressee. In addition, \nshe points out that the presence of the Latin prefix \u201cre-\u201d (\u201cback\u201d) in verbs referring to \nanswering (e.g. \u201creply\u201d, \u201crefute\u201d) suggests movement in the opposite direction, as is also \nthe case with \u201cback came his answer\u201d in example (30).  \n \nOverall, my data contains 93 instances of NRS\/NRSAs involving expressions to do with \nphysical transfer. As I mentioned earlier, these expressions constitute the largest group of \nmetaphorical references to speech activity in my data, amounting to 20 per cent of all \nmetaphorical NRS\/NRSAs in my concordances. It is also important to notice that the \nexpressions to do with transfer suggest a conceptualization of communication that is \nbroadly compatible with that suggested by the expressions discussed in previous sections \n\u2013 namely as a physical space within which the communication of meanings, the \nperformance of speech acts and the production of utterances\/texts are presented in terms \nof the transfer of physical objects along a conduit from addressers to addressees. \n \nExpressions relating to visibility and visual representation \nWithin Reddy\u2019s (1979) account of the \u201cCONDUIT\u201d metaphor, meanings correspond to \nobjects and linguistic expressions corresponds to containers, so that understanding \ncorresponds to the emergence of the meanings\/contents from the words\/containers. This, \naccording to Reddy, accounts for the conventional use of \u201creveal\u201d in relation to verbal \ncommunication in expressions such as \u201cCloser reading reveals altogether \nuncharacteristic feelings in the story\u201d (Reddy 1979: 193).  \n \nMy data contains 19 similar examples of the use of \u201creveal\u201d, as well as three uses of the \nverb \u201cdisclose\u201d in expressions such as the following: \n \n32. Whitehall sources last night disclosed that the secret list [. . .] played a crucial role \nin defusing the diplomatic row (The Observer, 13\/5\/1996) \n \nLike \u201creveal\u201d, the verb \u201cdisclose\u201d still retains the (rather archaic) physical sense of \nmaking something visible by removing a cover that was hiding it from view (e.g. He \ncleared away the grass and disclosed a narrow opening descending into the darkness, \nfrom the BNC).  \n \nGrady (1998) explains this kind of expression in terms of the primary metaphor \n\u201cINFORMATION IS CONTENTS\u201d, and goes on to consider \u201cfurther motivation for the \ncontainment image which applies so naturally to linguistic forms\u201d (Grady 1998: 214). He \nproposes that one salient motivation is the primary metaphor \u201cBECOMING ACCESSIBLE IS \nEMERGING\u201d. He explains the relevance of this metaphor as follows: \n \nThere are numerous linguistic examples which reflect a metaphoric association \nbetween perceptibility and location outside a container. The motivation for such a \nmetaphor could not be more natural, of course, since perceptibility is literally \ncorrelated with location out in the open in so many cases. (Grady 1998: 214) \n \n 22\nGrady (1998) also points out that the well-known conceptual metaphor \u201cKNOWING IS \nSEEING\u201d is based on the same kind of experiential correlation, and proposes two separate \nprimary metaphors where the source domain involves location outside a container: \n\u201cPERCEPTIBLE IS \u2018OUT\u2019\u201d (e.g. \u201cHeat brings out the flavor in the soup\u201d) and \u201cACCESSIBLE \nTO AWARENESS IS \u2018OUT\u2019\u201d (e.g. \u201cThe facts in the case will come out sooner or later\u201d) \n(Grady 1997: 296). In addition, Grady (1997: 297) considers expressions such as \u201cWhy \ndid you have to bring that up again?\u201d , and puts forward the primary metaphor \n\u201cACCESSIBLE TO PERCEPTION\/AWARENESS IS \u2018UP\u2019\u201d, which, he argues, is based on \u201cthe \ncorrelation between being in a higher position\u2015e.g., at eye level, or out from under an \nobstruction\u2015and being perceptible\u201d (Grady 1997: 297). \n \nMy corpus contains many examples where the expression and reception of meaning in \nspeech is metaphorically presented in terms of visibility and emergence. These \nexpressions differ, however, with respect to how exactly meanings are made \nmetaphorically visible to addressees. I will discuss each of the three main patterns I have \nidentified in turn.  \n \nMovement into view  \nTwenty of the metaphorical NRS\/NRSAs in the corpus can be related to Grady\u2019s \n\u201cACCESSIBLE TO AWARENESS IS \u2018OUT\u2019\u201d or \u201cBECOMING ACCESSIBLE IS EMERGING\u201d primary \nmetaphors. However, these expressions suggest a somewhat more complicated picture \nthan that proposed by Grady. Consider the following examples: \n \n33. It is an indication of how low Kylie\u2019s emotional defences were during this crisis \nthat \u2013 just for once \u2013 the intensely personal details of her life suddenly came \ngushing out (Stone, S., Kylie Minogue: The Superstar Next Door, 1990, p. 55) \n34. \u201cYou want to -\u201d was all he got out before Paulie snapped, (McDermid, V. Dead \nBeat, 1992, p. 168) \n \nBoth the expressions \u201ccome gushing out\u201d and \u201cget out\u201d have physical senses that relate to \nmovement out of a container or a bounded space. However, here it is not the words or the \ntext that correspond to a container. Rather, the speakers themselves (respectively, the \npop-singer Kylie Minogue and a character called Dennis) are implicitly constructed as \ncontainers, from which meanings come out via language. More precisely, in example (33), \nthe contents of the speaker\u2019s utterances (the intensely personal details of her life) are \npresented as the agent of the movement; in example (34), the speaking character is \npresented as attempting to get particular meanings out of himself. These examples, \ntherefore, appear to realize both \u201cACCESSIBLE TO AWARENESS IS \u2018OUT\u2019\/BECOMING \nACCESSIBLE IS EMERGING\u201d and \u201cTHE BODY IS A CONTAINER\u201d (see also Vanparys 1995: 24-6).   \n \nIt is not always the case, however, that the metaphorical references to visibility and \nemergence in my data also involve explicit or implicit references to movement out of \ncontainers. My concordances include one instance of the use of \u201cbring up\u201d in the sense of \n\u201cmention\u201d that was noticed by Grady, as well as examples such as the following: \n \n 23\n35. [S]enior medical staff [. . .] raised doubts  about the accuracy of the American-\ndeveloped test used in her diagnosis. (The Observer, 28\/4\/1996 \n36. But he floated  Tom King\u2019s suggestion that \u2026  (Thatcher, M. The Downing Street \nYears, 1993, p. 854) \n \nExample (35) is one of five cases in the corpus where the verb \u201craise\u201d is used in reference \nto verbal activity, with direct objects referring to speech acts or to what Reddy calls RMs \n(\u201cdoubts\u201d, \u201calarm\u201d, \u201cobjections\u201d, \u201cquestions\u201d). Give that, in its physical sense, the verb \n\u201craise\u201d suggests movement from below upwards, its use in my examples can be seen as a \nrealization of Grady\u2019s \u201cACCESSIBLE TO PERCEPTION\/AWARENESS IS \u2018UP\u2019\u201d primary metaphor. \nWithin this perspective, the conventional use of \u201craise\u201d in relation to communication is \nbased in our visual experience, where, if something is positioned too low, it may be \noutside the observer\u2019s field of vision, so that movement upwards involves movement into \nview. The conventional use of \u201cfloat\u201d in example (36) is rather different, but can also be \nexplained in terms of a mapping from visual experience: in its physical sense, this verb \ninvolves both permanence on the surface of the water (and hence visibility) and \nmovement with the current (and hence, possibly, towards the addressee and into their \nfield of vision). The corpus also contains two instances of the use of the verb \u201cput \nforward\u201d in reference to speech activity (e.g. \u201cI put forward the view that\u201d), which seem \nto work in a similar way. \n \nClearly, the expressions analysed in this section confirm the correlation, noted by Grady, \nLakoff and Johnson and others, between (1) knowledge and vision and (2) the expression \nof meaning and emergence\/movement into view. However, my data shows that what may \nact as source domain is not just emergence via movement upwards or out of a container, \nbut rather movement towards the addressee more generally. This could be explained in \nterms of a metaphor along the lines of \u201cACCESSIBLE TO AWARENESS\/CONSIDERATION IS \u2018IN \nFRONT\u2019\u201d ,  which may also motivate, for example, the conventional uses of the verb \n\u201cface\u201d in expressions such as the following, from the BNC: \u201cWe must face the facts\u201d and \n\u201cThe defence establishment is faced with a dual problem\u201d.  This metaphor has a similar \nexperiential basis as Grady\u2019s \u201cACCESSIBLE TO AWARENESS IS \u2018OUT\u2019\u201d and \u201cACCESSIBLE TO \nAWARENSS IS \u2018UP\u2019\u201d: in visual experience, there is a correlation between the positioning of  \nan object in front of us and our ability to perceive its properties. At a more general level, \nall these expressions can be related to \u201cKNOWING\/UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING\u201d, which, \naccording to Grady (1997: 296) has as a corollary \u201cCONSIDERING IS LOOKING AT\u201d. On the \nbasis of my examples, I could suggest the converse corollary, namely \u201cACCESSIBLE TO \nAWARENESS\/CONSIDERATION IS VISIBLE\u201d. Together these conceptual metaphors can \ntherefore explain why communication is conventionally metaphorically presented in \nterms of different types of movements into view.  \n \nPointing \nA further set of 23 examples from my data involve metaphorical references to verbal \nactivity in terms of the physical actions of pointing or indicating:  \n \n 24\n37. Officials at the Department of Energy still wanted to commission Pressurised \nWater Reactors which were an American development, pointing to the success of \nthe French nuclear industry (Adams, J. Tony Benn, 1992, p. 442) \n38. Only last Friday John Major pointed out that Labour\u2019s plans [. . .] would lead to \nthe break-up of the UK. (The Daily Express, 5\/12\/1994) \n39. Senior Cabinet sources indicated that the rebels would not be offered any more \ncompromises by the government. (Independent on Sunday, 4\/12\/1994) \n \nIn examples (37) and (38), the verbs \u201cpoint to\u201d and \u201cpoint out\u201d are used to refer \nmetaphorically to the action of mentioning something that is relevant to and supports the \nspeakers\u2019 argument. In example (39) the verb \u201cindicate\u201d is used to refer to the verbal \nprovision of new, relevant information. In all three cases, verbal communication is \nmetaphorically presented in terms of a physical scenario in which speakers make \nmeanings\/ideas\/facts accessible not by moving them into the addressee\u2019s field of vision \nbut by indicating their existence and location to the addressee (in fact, the expression \n\u201cpoint out\u201d involves both a metaphorical reference to the physical act of pointing and the \nnotion of emergence from containers in the prepositional adverb \u201cout\u201d). Within this \nscenario, meanings are therefore constructed as physical entities that are potentially \nvisible but that may not be noticed by the addressee without the speaker\u2019s intervention.  \n \nThe use of these expressions can be related to Grady\u2019s (1997: 296) \u201cCONSIDERING IS \nLOOKING AT\u201d primary metaphor, which he presents as a corollary of \u201cKNOWING IS SEEING\u201d, \nand exemplifies with expressions such as \u201cWe\u2019ll be taking a good, long look at him as a \nsuspect in this case\u201d (Grady 1997: 296). However, in my examples the focus is on what \nthe speaker\/writer does in order to enable the addressee to \u201clook at\u201d the meanings that he \nor she is trying to convey. The BNC contains many examples of \u201cpoint out\u201d and \u201cpoint \nto\u201d being used in the same ways as in 37 and 38. There are also many examples of the use \nof the verb \u201cpoint to\u201d in which the entity presented as the agent of the pointing action is \nnot the speaker\/writer but a text or some other entity (e.g. \u201cThe evidence [. . .] pointed to \na fire on board the DC-8 before it crashed\u201d). In all these cases whatever is being pointed \nout\/to is not just offered for consideration, but also presented as a true and relevant fact \nwithin the relevant discourse context. On the basis of this, I would propose a primary \nmetaphor along the lines of \u201cENABLING KNOWLEDGE\/CONSIDERATION IS \nPOINTING\/INDICATING\u201d. This metaphor is clearly closely related with both \u201cKNOWING IS \nSEEING\u201d and \u201cCONSIDERING IS LOOKING AT\u201d, and also to Grady\u2019s \u201cEXISTENCE IS VISIBILITY\u201d. \nThe latter is a primary metaphor that Grady (1997: 284) proposes in order to explain \nexamples such as \u201cThe dodo disappeared in the 1600s\u201d and \u201cRap music first appeared in \nthe late 70s\u201d. As Grady puts it, this metaphor is based on \u201cthe correlation between our \nawareness of objects (i.e. knowledge of their existence) and their presence within our \nfield of vision\u201d (Grady 1997: 284). This correlation helps to explain why the use of \n\u201cpoint to\u201d, \u201cpoint out\u201d and \u201cindicate\u201d in my examples suggests that whatever is being \npointed out\/to or indicated is \u201ctrue\u201d: in basic, perceptual experience, if something can be \nshown via pointing, it can also be seen; if it can be seen, it exists, and is therefore \u201ctrue\u201d.  \n \nVisual representation  \n 25\nThe corpus also contains six examples of NRSA in which verbal activity is \nmetaphorically referred to by means of expressions which have basic senses to do with \nvisual representation, as shown below: \n \n40. Mr Jack Straw, the party\u2019s home affairs spokesman, outlined proposals to redefine \nthe Queen\u2019s role and reduce the size of the Royal Family. (The Daily Telegraph, \n5\/12\/1994) \n41. Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has delivered a defiant message \nto restless Tory backbenchers, portraying himself as a staunch defender of the \nwelfare state. (The Observer, 13\/5\/1996) \n \nIn (40) the verbal expression of particular plans in broad, general terms is metaphorically \npresented in terms of providing an outline, i.e. a visual representation that shows the \nouter edges or shape of the represented objects, rather than the details. In (41) the verbal \nexpression of a particular opinion on something (in this case the speaker himself) is \nmetaphorically presented in terms of visual portrayal. Another similar expression \ncontained in the corpus is \u201cto represent (someone or something) as \u2026\u201d. In all these \nexamples the notion of making a visual representation is mapped onto that of expressing \nparticular meanings or opinions in words. In fact, these verbs can be metaphorically \napplied to the communication of meaning generally (i.e. not necessarily via words), as in \nthe following extracts from the BNC:  \u201cTable 18 outlines these limitations\u201d and \u201cThe \nManor House itself dates from the 13th. century but it has now been restored to portray \nhow this ancient building was the centre of a thriving farm at the turn of the century.\u201d  \n \nAll of these examples may be explained in terms of a conventional metaphorical mapping \nfrom the source domain of VISUAL REPRESENTATION to the target domain of \nCOMMUNICATION. The latter is to be intended in the broadest possible sense, i.e. including \ninforming, suggesting, explaining, or generally enabling the construction of particular \nmeanings. This metaphor, which could be referred to as \u201cENABLING \nKNOWLEDGE\/CONSIDERATION IS PROVIDING A VISUAL REPRESENTATION\u201d, is clearly closely \nconnected with \u201cKNOWING IS SEEING\u201d and the other visual metaphors I have discussed so \nfar. \n \nOverall, therefore, the expressions discussed in the whole of this section construct \ncommunication in terms of making visual perception possible in a number of different \nways, namely by: \ni. moving an entity out of a container, upwards, or towards the addressee; \nii. physically pointing at\/indicating something that is potentially visible but may not \nbe seen or noticed by the addressee; \niii. creating visual images that the addressee can see. \n \nThe corpus also contains the following interesting example, which does not fall under any \nof the patterns above, but which is clearly related to them: \n \n 26\n42. After Claudie had reluctantly and shamefacedly put him in the picture about \nCardinal\u2019s Wharf, he became really interested. (Worsthorne, P. Tricks of Memory. \nAn Autobiography: Peregrine Worsthorne, 1993, p. 125) \n \nHere the first person narrator\u2019s wife is talking to a doctor about a mysterious illness that \nis affecting her husband. Part of this involves explaining the unhygienic conditions in \nwhich they live in Cardinal\u2019s Wharf in London. This explanation is metaphorically \nreferred to by means of the conventional expression \u201cputting (someone) in the picture\u201d. \nHere a visual representation (\u201cthe picture\u201d) seems to correspond to the meanings or \ncontents that are being communicated, and the speaker\u2019s role is presented as physically \nplacing the addressee inside the picture. In other words, in this expression the meanings \nor contents themselves are presented as a container or a bounded region which can be \nentered in order for understanding to take place. Once again, the relevant experiential \nbasis seems to be the correlation between being able to see something and knowing about \nit, so that speech activity is metaphorically presented as enabling others to see (see \nVanparys 1995: 16-17 for more examples).  \n \nIn her study of the historical development of verbs for mental and verbal activities, \nSweetser (1987: 448) notices that mental verbs often come from the domain of physical \nvision (e.g. \u201csee\u201d), while speech act verbs do not. My data shows that, indeed, some \nspeech activity verbs have physical senses to do with enabling vision. This suggests a \ncoherent metaphorical scenario in which knowledge\/understanding is constructed in \nterms of visual perception, and communication (which enables knowledge\/understanding) \nis constructed in terms of enabling visual perception.  \n \nCumulatively, the different types of expressions relating to visibility and emergence \ndiscussed in this section account for 77 examples of NRS\/NRSAs in my concordances, \namounting to 16.5 per cent of all metaphorical references to speech activity in my data. \nThis represents the third largest group, after expressions to do with the transfer of objects \n(20 per cent) and with the physical construction of objects (18 per cent). By adding \ntogether the different types of expressions that Reddy would have subsumed under the \nCONDUIT metaphor (i.e. those to do with transfer and visibility\/emergence), we can \ntherefore account for 36.5 of all metaphorical NRS\/NRSAs in my data and just under five \nper cent of all the references to speech activity I analysed. Although this is a substantial \nproportion of metaphorical NRS\/NRSAs in my concordances, it is considerably less than \nReddy\u2019s estimate that 70 per cent of all commonly used expressions for communication \nin English are realizations of the CONDUIT metaphor. As I have shown in the course of the \npaper, English has a much larger variety of conventional expressions for (spoken) \ncommunication than Reddy (1979) noticed (see also Vanparys 1995 for a similar \nconclusion). \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe overall picture \nThe patterns I have discussed in this paper account for approximately 74 per cent of all \nmetaphorical NRSs and NRSAs in my data (i.e. 343 of the 463 NRS\/NRSAs that I \n 27\nanalysed as metaphorical out of the 3,548 occurrences included in the two concordances \nfrom the corpus). I do not have the space here to discuss the remaining 26 per cent of my \nmetaphorical data, which includes some further patterns (e.g. the metaphorical use of \nmental verbs such as \u201cobserve\u201d, and of verbs evoking animal behaviour, such as \u201csnarl\u201d \nand \u201ccoo\u201d), as well as many individual expressions that do not appear to be part of larger \npatterns (e.g. \u201ccrack jokes\u201d, \u201chave a go at\u201d). Table 1 provides an overview of the \nnumbers of occurrences of expressions evoking each of the source domains I have \ndiscussed, and of the percentage of cases they represent out of all metaphorical NRSs, all \nmetaphorical NRSAs, and all NRSs and NRSAs combined.  \n \nThe table shows that the expressions relating to the transfer of objects form the largest \ngroup, followed by expressions to do with the production of physical objects, and \nexpressions to do with visibility and visual representation. The remaining patterns are \nless frequent, but each does account for a non-negligible proportion of all metaphorical \nreferences to speech activity in my data. More importantly, however, I have shown that \nsome of the patterns that are less frequent in my data (e.g. those to do with physical \npressure and support) are actually part of much larger metaphorical patterns in English \nthat apply to a wide range of target domains beyond spoken communication. \n \nTable 1 \u2013 Number of occurrences of expressions belonging to different metaphorical \npatterns, and percentages of all metaphorical NRSs, NRSAs and NRS\/NRSAs combined. \nSource domains \n \nMetaphorical \nNRSs  \n(reporting clauses) \nMetaphorical \nNRSAs \n(narrator\u2019s \nrepresentation of \nspeech acts) \nTotals \nTransfer 48 (19%) 45   (21%) 93 (20%) \nProduction of \nphysical objects \n \n57 (22.5%) 27 (13%) 84 (18%) \nVisibility and visual \nrepresentation \n \n49 (20%) 28   (13%) 77 (16.5%) \nMovement 21 (8.5%) 14   (6.5%) 35 (7.5%) \nPhysical aggression 6  (2.5%) 27   (13%) 33 (7%) \nPhysical proximity -   9   (4%) 9 (2%) \nPhysical pressure   1 (0.5%)   7   (3%) 8 (2%) \nPhysical support -   4   (2%) 4 (1%) \nOther 67 (27%) 53   (26.5%) 120 (26%) \n \nTotals \n \n249 (100%) \n \n214 (100%) \n \n463 (100%) \n \nOverall, my analysis has shown that complex domains such as spoken communication are \nmetaphorically structured by a set of different source domains. These source domains \ntend to (i) have an image-schematic basis, (ii) have a wide metaphorical scope, and (iii) \nstructure one or more particular aspects of the target via their own most salient and \ndistinctive aspects. More specifically, the complexity of target domains such as speech \n 28\nactivity results from the fact that it includes a wide variety of aspects, namely elements, \nprocesses, actions, relationships and goals. Many of these aspects are shared by other \ntarget domains, and are therefore metaphorically structured by the same (aspects of the \nsame) source domains. For example, as I have shown, one aspect of the domain of spoken \ncommunication is the provision of help\/assistance to others via speech, which can be \nexpressed metaphorically in terms of physical support. The notion of help\/assistance, \nhowever, is also part of many other areas of experience (e.g. family relationships, \ninterpersonal relationships generally, sports, politics, economics, and so on), and can \ntherefore be expressed in terms of physical support in relation to many different target \ndomains, as others have pointed out (e.g. Grady 1997, Lakoff and Johnson 1999). One \nway of capturing these more general patterns that cut across many different areas of \nexperience is via Grady\u2019s primary metaphors, which, as I have shown, can often explain \nboth the patterns I found in my data and the fact that the same expressions can also be \napplied to domains other than speech activity. As I mentioned earlier, K\u00f6vecses (2002) \naccounts for the same phenomena via the notion of central mappings that project the main \nmeaning focus of wide-scope source domains onto a wide range of target domains. \n \nIn my analysis I also identified the main aspects of speech activity that tend to be \nconstructed metaphorically, the source domains that are involved in each case, and the \nwider applicability of the sets of expressions resulting from each source domain. For \nexample, a central aspect of the domain of speech activity is the expression of meanings \nso that others can understand them. This aspect, as Reddy (1979) originally noted, is \nmetaphorically constructed in terms of the transfer and visibility of objects, which, as \nGrady (1998) has pointed out, are also applied to the expression and understanding of \nmeaning generally, i.e. not just via speech or language. Another central aspect of the \ndomain of speech activity is the expression and negotiation of mutual relationships, \nwhich are metaphorically constructed via expressions to do with physical proximity, \nsupport and pressure. These expressions are also conventionally applied to social \ninteraction and relationship generally, i.e. not simply in the context of verbal \ncommunication. A more specific aspect of speech activity is the expression of negative \nattitudes in order to cause damage to others and their goals. This aspect is metaphorically \nconstructed in terms of expressions to do with physical aggression which also apply to \nother areas of experience involving negative attitudes and negative effects. In addition, \nthe production of messages and speech acts is presented in terms of the physical notions \nof making concrete objects and adding to them, which conventionally apply to many \nabstract processes and entities. And finally, the achievement of goals in and via speech is \nconstructed in the same ways as goals more generally, i.e. as destinations to be reached.  \n \nAs a consequence of all this, I have argued that the most appropriate level of abstraction \nfor the formulation of conceptual metaphors is that of primary metaphors, which capture \nsimple mappings that participate in the construction of many complex target domains. \nThis results in a more exhaustive and accurate view of linguistic patterns, and of possible \nunderlying conceptual mappings, than any generalizations that start from complex target \ndomains (e.g. \u201cSPEECH ACTIVITY IS \u2026\u201d or \u201cCOMMUNICATION IS \u2026\u201d). This approach also \nresults in a more economical and cognitively plausible account of how metaphorical \nmappings might be stored in conceptual structure, since a relatively small number of \n 29\nsimple and basic mappings can explain the production and reception of a very large \nnumber of linguistic expressions in many different contexts. \n \nAt the same time, this approach can also lead to more reliable accounts of the \nmetaphorical structuring of particular target domains. Although the conceptual metaphors \nthat motivate the different linguistic patterns are not always consistent with one another, \nthe main patterns I have identified can be combined into a coherent single \nconceptualisation of spoken communication in terms of a physical space containing \nentities corresponding to the interactants, their speech acts, their utterances\/texts, their \nviews\/ideas, and so on. Within this space: \n\u2022 interactants can move in or out, towards or away from other participants, speech acts, \nconversational goals (e.g. \u201cstep in with congratulations\u201d, \u201cjoin the condolences\u201d, \n\u201cbacktrack\u201d); \n\u2022 interactants can be positioned in different ways in relation to each other (e.g. \u201cback\u201d, \n\u201cstand by\u201d); \n\u2022 interactants can come into physical contact with each other in different ways, i.e. with \nor without pressure (e.g. \u201cpress\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d) or engaging in different types of \nphysical aggression (e.g. \u201crap\u201d, \u201chit out\u201d, \u201cblast\u201d); \n\u2022 speech acts and texts\/utterances can be physically constructed (\u201cmake a plea\u201d), added \nto (\u201cadd\u201d) and transferred from addressers to addressees (e.g. \u201cgive an order\u201d, \n\u201cdeliver a speech\u201d). \n\u2022 texts\/utterances, their contents, or their illocutionary force can become visually \naccessible to the addressee via different types of movement (e.g. \u201ccame gushing out\u201d, \n\u201craise doubts\u201d), pointing (e.g. \u201cpoint to\u201d), or visual representation (e.g. \u201coutline\u201d). \n \nI am not suggesting that the above scenario \u201cexists\u201d as a single conceptualization in the \nminds of any, let alone all, speakers of English. What I am suggesting is that the main \npatterns I have identified in my data seem to indicate that speech activity is \nconceptualised in English in terms of a range of physical actions and interactions which, \nat a general level, are compatible with each other and can be integrated into a single \nscenario. \n \nFinal methodological considerations \nThe last few years have seen a rise in the use of electronic corpora in metaphor research \n(e.g. Boers 1999, Cameron and Deignan 2003, Deignan 1999, 2000; Peters and Wilks \n2003, Semino 2002, Semino et al. 2004). These studies show how the adoption of a \ncorpus-based approach, coupled with an explicit and rigorous identification procedure \n(e.g. Cameron 2003: 58ff.), can lead to important advances in our understanding of \nmetaphorical patterns in language, and also place the extrapolation of conceptual \nmetaphors from linguistic evidence on a much firmer empirical footing than it has been in \nthe past.  \n \nIn the present study, the adoption of a corpus methodology has enabled me to arrive at \nresults that are, I believe, more exhaustive and reliable than those obtained on the basis of \nintrospection and\/or the random collection of examples. First, my data was obtained from \na balanced and representative quarter-of-a-million word corpus of (late) 20th century \n 30\nwritten British narrative texts. Second, the fact that the corpus was annotated for forms of \nSW&TP provided me with a fairly large number of relevant examples (3,548 references \nto speech acts\/activity, of which 463 were analysed as metaphorical). Third, I \nsystematically used a larger corpus (the 100-million word British National Corpus) in \norder to provide examples of other (not speech-related) uses of the expressions under \nanalysis (see Cameron and Deignan 2003 and Semino 2002 for a similar combination of \nsmaller and larger corpora in metaphor research). All this has enabled me to notice a \nlarger and richer variety of metaphorical linguistic patterns for speech activity than had \nbeen observed before, which in turn has put me in a better position to make claims about \npossible underlying conceptual metaphors. I have also been able to compare the \nfrequencies of different patterns of metaphorical expressions in my data. Inevitably, \nhowever, the overall picture I have proposed can only be an advance on what previous \nstudies have achieved, and will in turn need to be further refined and completed by \nfurther, large-scale analyses.  \n \nNotes \n \n1 I am grateful to Zoltan K\u00f6vecses, Alan Cienki, Ray Gibbs and an anonymous reviewer for their feedback \non an earlier draft of this paper.
