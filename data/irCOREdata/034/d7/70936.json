Extensive optical observations have been carried\nout at the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program\n(HAARP) ionospheric heating facility since it began opera-\ntions in 1999. A number of modern optical diagnostic instru-\nments are hosted at remote sites as well as the main trans-\nmitter facility, which has recently been expanded from the\ninitial 960 kW prototype configuration to its full 3.6 MW de-\nsign capability. Upgrades to optical diagnostics have allowed\na number of interesting new observations to be made at the\n960 kW power level since 2004. Systematic beam-swinging\nexperiments generating quantifiable levels of optical emis-\nsion at various regions in the sky for the first time clearly\nshow that emission intensity is very sensitive to distance from\nthe magnetic zenith, and drops off rapidly at about 15\u25e6 zenith\nangle in directions other than magnetic south. High temporal\nresolution measurements of emissions in the 557.7 nm green\nline at start-up and in short transmitter pulses demonstrate\nthat localized irregularities are preferentially excited in the\ninitial seconds of heating, with evolution into a more ho-\nmogenous spot occurring over a period of about 1 min. High-\nquality emission altitude profiles at both 630.0 and 557.7 nm\nhave recently been isolated from side-looking data, spanning\nan altitude extent of over 200 km, which has allowed deter-\nmination of the effective lifetime of O (1D) over an unprece-\ndented altitude range. An innovative automated remote im-\nager network utilizing low-cost mirror optics has been de-\nsigned and deployed to make such measurements routinely.\nObservations of natural optical emissions at the site have re-\nvealed the common presence of highly structured but faint\nco-rotating subauroral precipitation that acts to suppress ex-\nCorrespondence to: T.

The main HF transmitter, or Ionospheric Research\nInstrument (IRI), in initial prototype configuration consisted\nof an array of 6\u00d78 crossed dipoles providing 960 kW total\npower, with nominal effective radiated power (ERP) ranging\nfrom 10.8 MW at 2.8 MHz to 260 MW at 10 MHz. The trans-\nmitter array has recently been expanded to 15\u00d712 elements\nproducing a total power of 3.6 MW, corresponding to nom-\ninal ERP of 260 MW at 2.8 MHz and 4400 MW at 10 MHz.\nThe IRI beam can be steered by electronic phasing of the an-\ntenna elements to any point within 30\u25e6 of zenith, although\nmovements of more than 15\u25e6 from a pre-tuned position re-\nquire several seconds for re-tuning.\nDiagnostic instrumentation has been an essential part of\nthe HAARP facility since its inception, and a number of op-\ntical instruments have been deployed and operated at the site\nas part of the facility\u2019s permanent diagnostics, with others\noperated at remote locations. The current optical diagnostics\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n1090 T. Pedersen et al.: Recent optical observations at HAARP\non site consist of the HAARP imager, the HAARP telescope,\nand the HAARP photometer. The HAARP imager is a tele-\ncentric system utilizing 3.5\u2032\u2032 narrow-band (2 nm) filters feed-\ning a recently upgraded 1\u2032\u2032 thermo-electrically cooled bare\nCCD camera. It can be operated with either a fish-eye lens\nfor all-sky coverage or placed on a mount and equipped with\na 16\u25e6 lens for higher resolution observations of optical emis-\nsions within the HAARP beam. The HAARP telescope con-\nsists of an 8\u2032\u2032 diameter refractor telescope with 3\u2032\u2032 filters im-\naged by a 1\/2\u2032\u2032 cooled bare CCD camera. It includes a second\nsimilar camera with approximately 14\u25e6 field of view for con-\ntext. The HAARP photometer has 2 dedicated channels for\nobservation of the 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm oxygen lines, plus\na third channel equipped with a filter wheel, which can be\noperated at a single wavelength or scanned through all of the\nfilters in rapid succession. A recent addition to the HAARP\noptical diagnostic suite is the first of a network of remote\nimaging systems, to be discussed in detail in a later section.\nThe first optical observations at HAARP were in March\n1999, when 630 nm red line enhancements of\u223c150 Rayleigh\n(R) were seen during vertical heating, although with ex-\ntremely poor sensitivity due to an observation mode opti-\nmized for natural aurora (Pedersen and Carlson, 2001). Sig-\nnificant emissions were not seen again until March 2001,\nalso during vertical heating, although in both these early ex-\nperiments there were indications of enhanced emissions in\nthe magnetic zenith. Experiments to direct the beam into\nthe magnetic zenith were first carried out in early February\n2002, and over the course of the campaign a large number\nof observations were made of the localized bright spot about\n7\u25e6 in diameter which appeared in the magnetic zenith un-\nder a wide range of conditions (Pedersen et al., 2003). The\n2003 campaign featured the first attempt to stimulate elec-\ntron gyroharmonic resonances, but poor weather and active\naurora limited useful observations to only a few minutes. In\nthe winter of 2004, good conditions were encountered and\na number of measurements made at the 2nd and 3rd gyro-\nharmonics (Djuth et al., 2005; Kosch et al., 2005), which al-\nlowed detectable emissions in both 630.0 and 557.7 nm lines\nto be produced even at the extremely low ERP resulting from\nthe broad beam at low frequencies near 2.8 MHz. The 2004\ncampaign also marked a turning point in diagnostics, as im-\nproved imagers came into permanent use at this time and the\ntelescope was able to routinely image structure within the\nairglow spot.\nIn the sections that follow, we present and discuss observa-\ntions made since 2004, when a variety of new and interesting\nfeatures in both artificial and natural optical emissions have\nbeen observed, many resulting from the combination of im-\nproved optical instruments and the highly efficient 2nd gyro-\nharmonic resonance. Many of these observations are unique,\ndepending upon capabilities or modes not available at other\nionospheric heaters or resulting from interactions with the\nunique local environment.\n2 Observations of artificial optical emissions\n2.1 Beam swinging experiments\nOne of the unique capabilities of the HAARP transmitter is\nits ability to be repositioned over a relatively wide range of\nangles. This capability was employed in the first observa-\ntions of the magnetic zenith spot at HAARP, in the form of\na conical scan at 15\u25e6 zenith angle (Pedersen et al., 2003).\nThese early measurements at HAARP showed indications\nof faint emissions from beam positions other than magnetic\nzenith, and several cases of optical emissions from vertical\nheating were known from HAARP prior to active stimula-\ntion of the magnetic zenith effect. Until improved imagers\nwere deployed in the last few years, however, the threshold\nfor detection of emissions at other beam positions generally\nremained too high.\nOn 6 February 2005, a beam swinging experiment was\nconducted specifically to investigate the dependence of\nlaunch angle on optical emission production efficiency. The\ntransmitter beam was slewed between magnetic zenith (204\u25e6\naz. 15\u25e6 zen., used as a control,) and a variety of positions\nincluding the vertical and 15\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 off zenith in each of\nthe cardinal magnetic directions. The beam alternated be-\ntween 2 min in other positions and 2 min in the magnetic\nzenith, with 30 s allocated for repositioning between posi-\ntions to round out a 5 min cycle. The experiment was run\nin the decaying twilight ionosphere, which allowed for fre-\nquencies from 4.3 MHz down to 2.8 MHz near the 2nd gy-\nroharmonic to be utilized. Figure 1 shows sample 630 nm\nred-line images from this experiment, with power contours\nfor the 2.83 MHz beam superimposed on the all-sky images,\nwhich in this experiment were oriented to magnetic coordi-\nnates. The lower left side of each image is contaminated with\ntwilight, and the natural aurora can be seen on the far north-\nern horizon. The position of the magnetic zenith is marked\nwith an \u201cX\u201d.\nIn the first three cases the beam center is far from the\nmagnetic zenith, which is on or outside the 10% power con-\ntour. The artificial emissions can be seen to be of the dif-\nfuse beam-filling type, representing enhancements of a few\ntens of Rayleigh above the background. Rather than be-\ning distributed throughout the beam, however, the emissions\nare most intense in the sector of the beam toward magnetic\nzenith. Emissions reach a maximum approximately midway\nbetween the magnetic zenith and the beam center. The lack\nof significant emissions in the beam center in spite of the\npower peaking there suggests that either refraction of the rays\nback toward the earth has prevented the waves from reaching\na resonant altitude, or that the aspect-angle dependence of the\noptical production mechanism dominates over the increasing\ngradient in ERP toward the center of the beam.\nThe fourth frame in the figure shows optical emissions pro-\nduced when the beam was pointed 30\u25e6 from zenith toward\nmagnetic south, or 15\u25e6 beyond the magnetic zenith.

Pedersen et al.: Recent optical observations at HAARP 1091\nFig. 1. 630.0 nm emissions produced at various angles off verti-\ncal on 6 February 2005: 30\u25e6 toward magnetic east (upper left),\n30\u25e6 toward magnetic west (upper right), 15\u25e6 toward magnetic north\n(lower left), and 30\u25e6 toward magnetic south (lower right). Beam\ncontours for 10, 50, and 90% of maximum power are shown, and\nthe position of magnetic zenith is marked with an \u201cX\u201d. Twilight\nforms a broad band at lower left in each image, while the distant\naurora can be seen at top.\nmagnetic zenith sits on the 50% contour at this point, and\nthe typical magnetic zenith spot is stimulated and produces\napproximately 50 R of emissions. Secondary enhancements\nincluding a bright spot on the 90% contour on the far side\nof the beam can also be seen, indicating that waves directed\nmore than 30\u25e6 from zenith have reached some resonant alti-\ntude. The beam center, however, is lacking significant emis-\nsions, although in this case the irregular nature of the emis-\nsions suggest that large-scale irregularities could be present,\nducting the radio waves along paths not possible in a smooth\nionosphere. The patchy nature of the emissions observed on\nthis occasion, which was toward the end of the experiment,\nmay result from penetration of the transmitter beam through\nregions of lower density as the average ionospheric critical\nfrequency approached the transmitter frequency, as discussed\nby Kosch et al. (2005).\nLine plots of calibrated emission intensity through these\nimages from geographic zenith toward the beam center are\nshown in Fig. 2, along with transmitter beam power. These\nprovide additional insight into the spatial dependence of the\nemissions, and reveal a significant asymmetry between the\nmagnetic meridian and the direction perpendicular to it.

Line profiles of 630 nm emission intensity (solid) and\nHAARP beam ERP (dashed) for the images shown in Fig. 1. Pro-\nfiles are along the cardinal magnetic directions in the geographic\nazimuths as indicated at the top of each panel. Increases in intensity\nbeyond 30\u25e6 zenith angle are due to the natural sky background.\nwhich they drop off rapidly to background levels in spite of\nbeam power rising threefold over the next 20\u25e6. Note that the\nlarge increase in optical intensity beyond 30\u25e6 zenith angle\nin each of the profiles in this figure results from the natural\noptical background increasing at lower elevation angles and\ndoes not reflect any artificial effects. The upper right panel\nfor magnetic west shows the same basic behavior as mag-\nnetic east, with emissions rising along with beam power for\nthe first \u223c10\u25e6 before dropping precipitously to background\nlevels. In both cases perpendicular to the magnetic meridian\nthe intensity has dropped to background levels by about 15\u25e6\nzenith angle, regardless of the beam power.\nAlong the magnetic meridian, however, the behavior is\nsignificantly different. The lower left panel shows beam\npower directed at 15\u25e6 magnetic north, but the emissions peak\napproximately 20\u25e6 southward, just south of zenith, and drop\noff sharply to reach background levels near 20\u25e6. The mag-\nnetic zenith enhancement is also clearly visible near \u221213\u25e6\nzenith angle in spite of beam power approaching zero there.\nThe beam directed at 30\u25e6 magnetic south, at lower right,\nproduces a large enhancement in the magnetic zenith at 15\u25e6\nzenith angle, and a secondary enhancement near 30\u25e6, which\nappears to result from the irregular ionospheric structure\npresent at this time rather than being a permanent spatial fea-\nture. Taken as a whole, these data indicate production effi-\nciency dropping off rapidly by \u223c15\u25e6 toward the E and W.\nIn the meridian, efficiency drops equally rapidly toward the\nN, but is significant from vertical through and well beyond\nMZ. A full ray-tracing analysis through a realistic 4-D iono-\nspheric reconstruction will be required to determine whether\nthe observed cut-offs result from propagation conditions pre-\nventing the transmitter beam from reaching the interaction\naltitude or are a feature of the ionospheric interaction mech-\nanism.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/1089\/2008\/ Ann.

Each frame is approximately 9\u25e6 across. Time stamps\nrefer to the start time for each 5 s exposure.\n2.2 High temporal resolution imaging\nOptical imaging at HAARP had previously been limited to\nframe rates of\u223c10 s or greater due to sensitivity, readout and\nhousekeeping requirements on the various imager systems,\nbut in light of some 2005 results showing beam-filling green\nline emissions collapsing into the magnetic zenith spot dur-\ning the first \u223c1 min of heating (Kosch et al., 2007a), which\nalso suggested an possible explanation for the green line on-\nset delay first observed in 2002 (Pedersen et al., 2003), a con-\ncentrated effort to image the development of the emissions at\nhigher time resolution was made in the most recent 2006 op-\ntical campaign. An electron multiplication charge-coupled\ndevice (EM-CCD) camera was employed for the first time,\nand conventional CCD cameras were operated with minimal\nexposure time at multiple wavelengths to increase the overall\ntemporal resolution. These diagnostic techniques were com-\nbined with a pulsed transmitter mode to investigate initial\nconditions and observe the evolution of the HAARP spot.\nFigure 3 shows a 1-min sequence of narrow-field 557.7 nm\nimages taken at 5 s intervals during the first minute of a 2-\nmin transmitter pulse at 2.83 MHz, near the 2nd harmonic\nof the electron gyrofrequency. The \u223c9\u25e6 field of view corre-\nsponds to \u223c40 km horizontal distance at 250 km altitude. In\nthe first frame, two irregular localized regions approximately\n5\u201310 km in size light up. Over the next 20 s or so, these\nstructures move steadily while diffusing out, until at 30 s\nafter turn-on the region is relatively diffuse, although new,\nless distinct structure continues to appear and drift across the\nfield of view, a motion which is much more readily appar-\nent in movies of the image data. As the typical diameter of\nthe magnetic zenith spot is on the order of the size of these\nimages, the overall increase in unstructured 557.7 nm emis-\nsions within the spot relative to the background sky is not\nreadily apparent from this data. Significant optical structure\nwithin the magnetic zenith spot is common at HAARP in\nhigh-resolution 557.7 nm images (see Djuth et al., 2005, for\nan example), but with integration times of up to 30 s required,\nthe initial dynamics of the small-scale structures were not\nable to be determined, beyond the fact that the structure gen-\nerally moves steadily across the spot. It is clear from the new\nhigh time resolution data, however, that localized small-scale\nstructures are preferentially excited in the first few seconds\nof heating, and that the overall character of the emissions be-\ncomes more diffuse as time progresses.\nIn addition to high temporal resolution measurements of\nthe leading edge of standard multiple-minute transmitter\npulses, a short-pulse mode specifically for higher-speed opti-\ncal observations was also devised and run during the March\n2006 campaign. Figure 4 shows such a customized trans-\nmitter pulse and exposure sequence employed on 30 March\n2006. The 5 min O-mode sequence was run at a nominal\nERP of 11 MW and a frequency of 2.81 MHz targeting the\n2nd harmonic of the electron gyrofrequency at an altitude of\n\u223c250 km. The sequence started with 1 min of transmitter off,\nfollowed by 5 10-s periods consisting of 2 s on and 8 s off to\nallow diagnostic measurements while minimizing effects on\nthe ionosphere. The second minute was finished off by a 10 s\non period that was certain to provide adequate exposure time\nif no signals rose above the detection threshold during the 2 s\npulses. Another minute of off was allowed before the main\npulse of 2 min of full power completed the sequence. Three\ncameras (1 all-sky and 2 narrow-field systems observing at\n557.7 and 630.0 nm) were operated according to the expo-\nsure sequence represented by the dashed line near the top of\nthe figure. The systems were synchronized to the transmit-\nter to expose during the 2 s on pulses and take dark frames\nduring the 8 s off periods, with longer exposures of up to 8 s\noccurring later in each minute.\nThis mode produced detectable green and red emissions\nduring several of the initial 2 s pulses. The first pulse, begin-\nning at 06:01:00 UT, showed no detectable emissions, but the\nsecond pulse 10 s later showed significant green line emis-\nsions in two small localized regions. These same regions\nlit up again on each successive pulse, and again during the\nfirst few exposures in the long power-on sequence before the\nemissions gradually diffused out into the normal spot simi-\nlar to that seen in the 5 s resolution images described earlier.\nIt is interesting to note that, unlike the continuous pulse ex-\nperiment shown in Fig. 3, the irregular regions remained un-\nchanged for the greater part of a minute, diffusing out only\nduring the extended 2 min on period. These initial results,\nespecially the lack of detectable emission on the first pulse,\nsuggest the possibility that the localized bright spots are cre-\nated by the transmitter itself during the first 2 s pulse which\nwere then able to absorb sufficient energy from the beam to\nexcite optical emissions on subsequent pulses. However, it\nis not clear how such large (5\u201310 km) irregularities could be\nAnn. Geophys., 26, 1089\u20131099, 2008 www.ann-geophys.net\/26\/1089\/2008\/\nT.

The\n5 s data in Fig. 3 are of insufficient temporal resolution to in-\nvestigate irregularity formation in the first few seconds, but\ndo clearly show a gradual diffusion and reduction in struc-\nture during the extended on period. A complicating factor for\nthe observations in Fig. 4, however, is the presence of highly\nstructured subauroral precipitation, of the type discussed in\nmore detail in a later section, in the area during the experi-\nment, which may have influenced the structure observed.\n2.3 Side looking imaging and altitude profiles\nSide-looking observations have been attempted in conjunc-\ntion with HAARP heating campaigns from several remote\nlocations since the original observations of artificial optical\nemissions in 1999, and have been an integral part of artifi-\ncial optical emission measurements at the EISCAT HEAT-\nING facility as well (Brandstrom et al., 1999; Gustavsson et\nal., 2001; Brandstrom, 2003). Useful side-looking images of\nHAARP artificial emissions have been available from Poker\nFlat, Alaska, 325 km from the HAARP site, since 2002.\nThese show the magnetic zenith spot to be roughly spheri-\ncal, with a similar extent in both altitude and horizontal di-\nameter. Significant field-aligned structure is also observed\nmoving through the spot, presumably with the E\u00d7B drift\nimposed by the background electric field, and represents the\nprojection along the magnetic field of the moving irregular\nstructure seen from below by cameras at the HAARP site.\nThe first useful altitude profiles from the 557.7 nm green line\nwere only successfully extracted recently, from data taken\nduring the February 2005 campaign (Kosch et al., 2007a).\nAdditionally, since 2004, all-sky images from the HAARP\nfacility have been able to capture altitude profiles of artificial\noptical emissions created by the HIPAS facility near Fair-\nbanks, Alaska, providing a second source of altitude infor-\nmation on artificial optical emissions.\nFigure 5 shows an example of HAARP altitude profiles\nextracted from the Poker Flat remote imaging data. Optical\nimages taken at 557.7 and 630.0 nm approximately every 20 s\nhave been averaged horizontally across the projection of the\nmagnetic field line passing through the HAARP transmitter,\nwarped to a common grid of time vs. altitude, and displayed\nas a composite-color keogram image. Stars were removed\nwith a median filter, and flat-fielding was performed to elim-\ninate instrumental reductions in intensity away from the im-\nage centers. Raw pixel values were converted to Rayleighs\nby assuming a spherical form for the emission spot and\ncomparing intensities with those from the fully calibrated\nHAARP imager viewing the emissions from below. Con-\ntours from hand-scaled ionosonde profiles were then super-\nimposed on the keogram. The optical emissions can be seen\nto extend over an altitude range of up to 200 km and are most\nintense at an altitude below the reflection (2.85 MHz) altitude\nbut near or just below the altitude of the upper hybrid reso-\nnance (labeled \u201cfUH\u201d). The emissions noticeably continue\nwell after all reflection at the transmitter frequency has been\nlost (\u223c04:05 UT) but die out as soon as the upper hybrid fre-\nquency is passed just after 04:30 UT, consistent with Kosch\net al. (2005).\nThe extended lifetime of the red line emissions can be\nclearly seen by the change in hue to red after the end of each\n1 min pulse, and the reduction in lifetime with altitude is also\napparent in the change toward redder hues (and therefore rel-\natively stronger 630.0 nm emissions) at higher altitudes. The\naltitude dependence of the red line effective emission life-\ntime \u03c4 can be examined in more quantitative terms by fitting\nemission intensities from individual pulses to a simple model\nallowing for the exponential dependence on the lifetime (cf.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/1089\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 1089\u20131099, 2008\n1094 T. Pedersen et al.: Recent optical observations at HAARP\nFig. 5. Calibrated composite color profiles (red=630.0 nm,\ngreen=557.7 nm) of emission intensity vs. altitude along the\nHAARP field line collected on 4 February 2005 from Poker Flat,\nAlaska, \u223c325 km from the HAARP site. Plasma frequency con-\ntours from the HAARP ionosonde, including the transmitter fre-\nquency of 2.85 MHz and the upper hybrid frequency matching\nthe transmitter frequency (\u201cfUH\u201d) have been superimposed on the\nkeogram. The scale at right indicates color as a function of red and\ngreen intensities.\nBernhardt et al., 1989; Gustavsson et al., 2001), varying peak\nsaturation intensities in each transmitter pulse, and the inte-\ngration and sampling times of the CCD cameras. This anal-\nysis provides, for the first time ever at HAARP, estimates of\nthe O (1D) effective emission lifetime as a function of al-\ntitude. In the side-looking data from 4 February 2005 pre-\nsented in Fig. 5, detectable emissions were present over an\naltitude range of approximately 200 km, from about 150 km\nto 350 km. Of this range, the analysis was able to retrieve\neffective lifetime estimates for altitudes between 190 and\n350 km. Outside of this range the algorithm failed to con-\nverge due to low signal level. Figure 6 shows the results of\nthe analysis. Error bars represent the ratio of the root-mean-\nsquare (RMS) deviation between the data and model and the\nRMS intensity of artificial optical emissions above the ambi-\nent background, expressed as a fraction of the best-fit effec-\ntive lifetime, i.e., 1\u03c4=\u03c4\u00d7(RMS(I6300\u2212M))\/(RMS(I6300)),\nwhere I6300 is the measured artificial enhancement in inten-\nsity above the sky background and M is the best-fit modeled\nintensity. The effective lifetime is found to be just below\n20 s at 190 km altitude and to rise to over 90 s at an altitude\nof 350 km. These results can be compared with previously\npublished altitude-resolved effective lifetime measurements\nfrom ionospheric heating, such as Bernhardt et al. (2000) and\nthe tomography study of Gustavsson et al. (2001). In these\ncases, measurements were available only near the emission\ncentroid altitude, and limited altitudinal coverage was ob-\ntained by small changes in the ionospheric interaction alti-\ntude during the course of the experiments. In contrast, the\nside-looking data from HAARP provide for the first time\n200 250 300 350\nAltitude (km)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nTi\nm\ne \nCo\nns\nta\nnt\n (s\nec\n)\nFig. 6.

Modeled intensities for\nthe best-fit effective lifetimes are shown as thick gray lines,\nwith thin black lines superimposed to show the background-\nsubtracted measured intensities. As the transmitter pulses\nwere only 1 min in duration throughout this experiment, satu-\nration of intensity was never observed even at the shortest ef-\nfective lifetimes and lowest altitudes, leaving all pulses with\na spike-like appearance. The width of the pulse bases, how-\never, clearly increases with altitude, indicating the larger ef-\nfective lifetime. At 200 and 250 km (left and center panels),\nwhere the signal intensity is relatively high, the model and\ndata agree very well, in accord with the small error bars pro-\nvided in Fig. 6. At 300 km (right panel), however, the signal\nintensity is much smaller and significant deviations between\nthe model and the data can be seen, especially near the base\nof the emission spikes where uncertainty in the background\nremoval has the greatest impact. The poorer quality fit at\n300 km altitude is reflected in the much larger error bar in\nFig. 6.\nSignificant changes in relative amplitude between the in-\ndividual pulses as a function of altitude are also apparent in\nFig. 7. At 200 km, the largest pulses are near 03:45 UT, with\nintensity dropping steadily thereafter, whereas at 250 and\n300 km altitude the largest amplitude pulse is near 04:00 UT.\nThe 4 pulses between \u223c04:12 and 04:25 UT have relatively\nconstant amplitudes at 200 km, and are about half the max-\nimum intensity seen in the experiment at this altitude, but\nat 250 km they are well over half the maximum and are\nclose to the amplitude of the other previous pulses at 300 km.\nGiven that the height-integrated amplitudes of the emission\nAnn.

Sample comparisons of modeled 630.0 nm emission intensities (thick gray line) and background-subtracted measurements (thin black\nline) for altitudes of 200, 250, and 300 km and the effective lifetime time constants plotted in Fig. 6.\nintensity for this same experiment, as recorded by the im-\nager at the HAARP site, have recently been used to discrim-\ninate between different excitation mechanisms (Kosch et al.,\n2007b), the large observed variations in intensity of the var-\nious pulses with altitude suggest that height-resolved optical\nemission measurements may provide a means for determin-\ning the altitudinal and possibly temporal dependence of the\ndifferent excitation mechanisms and transport phenomena.\n2.4 Dedicated remote imager network for altitude profiles\nBased on the utility of remote observations, both for alti-\ntude profiles and tomography of the optical emissions (see\nGustavsson, 2000, and Gustavsson et al., 2001) and to miti-\ngate the risk of adverse weather at the site during optical ex-\nperiments, a network of several remote optical observatories\nwas proposed for HAARP in 2005. Dubbed HAARPOON\n(HAARP Optical Observing Network), the design criteria\ncalled for a network of 3 or more automated remote stations\nwith at least 2 wavelengths spectral coverage, for a total cost\nof no more than 1 conventional bare CCD imager. The re-\nmote stations were to be able to observe the E-region at 100\nkm over HAARP with an elevation angle no less than 30 de-\ngrees, to minimize obstructions from horizon features, haze,\nand cloud layers. The F region at 300 km was required to\nbe observable with an elevation angle of no more than 60\ndegrees, to ensure an adequate baseline for triangulation of\nemission altitudes. Additionally, the ability to observe the\nHAARP beam center azimuth over the full range of beam\npositions (30\u25e6 off zenith) was considered highly desirable.\nSensitivity adequate to image the weak (a few tens of R at\n557.7 nm) emissions was of course a fundamental require-\nment.\nBased on these criteria, we produced a design in which\n95% of the hardware budget was allocated to cooled CCD\ncameras, with 2 cameras at each site operated simultaneously\nto provide wavelength coverage without the use of failure-\nprone filter wheels or other moving parts. Telecentricity suf-\nFig. 8. Schematic of the HAARPOON remote automated imager\ndesign concept.\nficient for employment of 2 nm narrow-band filters (\u00b17.5\u25e6)\nwas achieved by utilization of 50 mm SLR lenses (Nikkor\nf\/1.2) with 1\/2\u2032\u2032 ethernet-based CCD cameras (Apogee Alta\nE47). This lens and CCD combination provides a 15\u25e6 na-\ntive field of view allowing narrow-band filters to be mounted\ndirectly in front of the primary lens. For the sake of econ-\nomy, we utilized inexpensive 2\u2032\u2032 10 nm bandpass filters in\nstock from Andover Corporation. The desired 60\u25e6\u201390\u25e6 field\nof view was achieved at low cost by pointing the 15\u25e6 cameras\nat a large (\u223c50 cm diameter) 90\u25e6 field of view outdoor safety\nmirror of the type commonly used at blind intersections. The\ncameras were mounted in an insulated box with a heater, ven-\ntilation fan, and thermostat, and aimed through a window at\nthe safety mirror approximately 2 m distant. The mirror was\ntilted to eliminate obstruction by the camera enclosure, and\nthe cameras focused on the virtual image of the sky scene\nlocated at approximately half the mirror radius behind the\nmirror. The mirror surface is heated from behind using an\nelectric heating pad to prevent condensation of frost or dew\naccumulation of snow or ice. A schematic of the HAAR-\nPOON design is shown above in Fig. 8.\nAlthough the desired field of view in this mirror-based de-\nsign can be readily obtained with a small mirror close to the\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/1089\/2008\/ Ann.

The horizon is near the top of the images, with\nvertical near the bottom. Note the slight deterioration in focus near\nthe bottom of the image on the left, which corresponds to the more\ndistant upper part of the tilted mirror.\ncamera, the curved and tilted virtual image behind the mirror\nrequires a large depth of field, which depends on the absolute\nfocal length of the lens and the F-number of the lens used.\nTo operate at the lowest possible F-numbers, and therefore\nthe highest sensitivity, depth of field considerations require\nthe system to employ relatively large mirrors far from the\ncamera in order to achieve acceptable focus. For our sys-\ntem, the focal length l=50 mm, the F-number f =1.2, and\nchoosing 2 pixels as an acceptable circle of confusion c on\na 13 mm\u00d713 mm CCD chip binned down to 256\u00d7256 pix-\nels (\u223c0.1 mm\/pixel), we get a hyperfocal distance h\u2248l2\/fc\nof approximately 20.8 m. The approximate depth of field\nd can be computed from the hyperfocal distance h of the\nlens\/detector combination and the distance x to the image\nas d\u22482hx2\/(h2\u2212 x2). For x=2 m, d is approximately 25 cm,\njust barely adequate to accommodate the tilted virtual image\nbehind the 50 cm primary mirror selected for the system. As\nthe mirror is moved toward the camera, the depth of field falls\noff more rapidly than the image shrinks in size and depth (as-\nsuming smaller mirrors are used to fill the 15\u25e6 field of view),\nso the \u223c2 m mirror distance is a practical minimum for this\nlens\/detector combination, confirmed by experiments with\nmirrors of various sizes. In practice, spherical aberration and\ndefects in the low-cost mirrors are also non-negligible, so\ndepth of field is not the only limitation.\nHowever, considering the generally diffuse nature of the\nexpected emission structures and the trade-offs between sen-\nsitivity, exposure time, and spatial resolution, and cost,\nwe determined that inexpensive abberative optics with twin\nhigh-performance CCD cameras viewing the same mirror\nwere preferable to expensive high-quality optics feeding a\nsingle camera or less capable multiple CCD cameras. The\nstar field images in Fig. 9 show the actual performance of the\nfirst deployed system. The focus is adequate in the 560 nm\ncamera, verifying that the depth of field is adequate to ac-\ncommodate the depth of the virtual image, but the 630 nm\nimages are somewhat less focused than desired. Although\nno observations of artificial optical emissions have yet been\nmade in deployed configuration as of this writing, due to\nconstruction on the HAARP transmitter array, the sensitiv-\nity of the HAARPOON system was confirmed during the\nMarch 2006 campaign, when the prototype was operated at\nthe HAARP site in narrow-field mode without the mirrors in\nplace and obtained the 2 s green line images shown previ-\nously in Fig. 4.\n3 Observations of natural optical emissions\nAlthough a variety of interesting artificial optical phenom-\nena have been observed at HAARP, one of the greatest rev-\nelations from improved instrumentation has been the re-\ncent realization that the nominally subauroral environment\nat HAARP is anything but benign, and can have a dramatic\nimpact on HAARP operations.\nVarious auroral and subauroral phenomena ranging from\nsubstorms to SAR arcs were anticipated at HAARP and have\nbeen observed on occasion, but one of the most common\nand disruptive phenomena has been the highly structured\nhard subauroral precipitation that became apparent when im-\nproved imagers were first deployed for the 2004 winter cam-\npaigns. This phenomenon, which appears to be a slightly\nlower latitude manifestation of the \u201cco-rotating aurora\u201d re-\nported by Kubota et al. (2003), has occurred on a number of\noccasions during heating experiments at HAARP and drasti-\ncally affected the observed results, particularly by modulat-\ning the spatial structure of artificial optical emissions.\nAs detailed in a separate paper (Pedersen et al., 2007), this\nhard co-rotating subauroral precipitation as observed from\nHAARP is commonly found in the dusk and evening sec-\ntors, although occasionally remaining well into the morning\nsector, and is characterized by slow motion, weak intensi-\nties at 427.8 and 557.7 nm, and lack of significant red-line\nemissions at 630.0 nm. It appears in a variety of forms rang-\ning from relatively homogenous bands to widely distributed\nsmall-scale (\u223c10\u201330 km) curl-like structures dubbed \u201can-\ngels,\u201d which appear to be a late phase in the evolution of an\ninstability operating on the more homogenous precipitation\nregions, especially the poleward edges. Of primary interest\nfor ionospheric heating is the interaction between these re-\ngions of natural precipitation and the HF waves generated by\nthe HAARP transmitter.\nFigure 10 illustrates the effect of this hard natural precipi-\ntation in a dramatic fashion. On 23 March 2004, the HAARP\ntransmitter was operating in a 4 min on\u20131 min off mode at\n2.75 MHz on an otherwise quiet evening with the aurora far\nto the northeast. A transmitter pulse beginning at 06:35 UT\nresulted in the familiar enhanced 630.0 nm red emissions in\na small spot at magnetic zenith gradually tapering off away\nfrom the field aligned position at 06:38 UT. At about 06:45,\na faint band a few tens of R in intensity above the sky\nbackground appeared overhead in the 557.7 nm green-line\nAnn.

In the image at 06:47 UT, the red emissions return,\nbut are now limited to a small region between irregular struc-\ntures on the poleward edge of the green band. The narrowed\nspot moves slightly with the precipitation structure for the\nnext frame (not shown) but by 06:50 UT the artificial emis-\nsions are completely blocked by a wider part of the precipi-\ntation band.\nFigure 11 shows composite color (630.0 and 557.7 nm)\nimages for another heating experiment carried out in the\npresence of hard subauroral precipitation. In this case the\nprecipitation appears as widely distributed irregular structure\nslowly drifting toward the magnetic south-southwest in the\n557.7 nm green-line images. The transmitter was operating\nat 2.83 MHz in a 2 min on 2 min off mode. In the image for\n06:11 UT the artificial emissions (red) are clearly seen illu-\nminating the region near the magnetic zenith (marked with\na white plus sign) through a large hole in the natural precip-\nitation. A few minutes later, at 06:15, the precipitation has\ndrifted over the magnetic zenith, but the artificial emissions\nare now seen only in the gap to the south, where the inten-\nsity is significantly lower than in the magnetic zenith. By\n06:23, the next gap in the precipitation approaches magnetic\nzenith, and fills with artificial emissions while still some dis-\ntance away. This same effect repeats numerous times during\nthe course of the experiment, with the red line artificial emis-\nsions suppressed in areas where green line images show hard\nprecipitation.\nThese image sequences clearly demonstrate that hard sub-\nauroral precipitation spatially modulates the excitation of ar-\ntificial optical emissions. There are three potential mecha-\nnisms that could explain this effect: 1) F-region densities in\nflux tubes containing the precipitation are significantly differ-\nent from the ionosphere outside the precipitation and either\ndo not support emission-producing resonances or reflect or\nrefract the transmitter beam away from these flux tubes; 2) E-\nregion densities created by the precipitation reflect or refract\nHF waves away from the F-region within the precipitation\nregions; or 3) enhanced D region density created by the pre-\ncipitating particles absorbs HF waves before they reach the E\n06:11 UT 06:15 UT 06:23 UT\nMS\nME\nFig. 11. Widespread highly structured subauroral precipitation (vis-\nible as green in these composite color images) drifting slowly across\nthe field of view during a heating experiment on 26 March 2006.\nThe artificial optical emissions (red) appear only in the gaps in the\nnatural precipitation.\nand F regions. Mechanism 1) would be expected to result in\nmultiple traces on ionograms, as some frequencies from the\nwide range emitted by the ionosonde would be expected to\nsuccessfully penetrate the precipitation flux tubes even if the\nheater frequency was prevented from reaching that volume.\nMechanism 2) can clearly operate in sporadic and auroral E\nlayers, but, as with the first mechanism, E-region ionization\nsufficient to disrupt propagation to the F region should pro-\nduce detectable signatures in ionograms.\nUnder mechanism 3), enhanced D region densities in the\nprecipitation region would absorb the HF waves from both\nthe transmitter and the ionosonde, restricting optical emis-\nsions and E and F region ionosonde echoes to flux tubes\ndevoid of precipitation. For a typical broad ionosonde\nbeam and partial precipitation coverage, no obvious signa-\nture would be apparent in the ionograms, apart from a possi-\nbly smaller number of echoes, as returns from precipitation-\nfree flux tubes within the ionosonde beam would remain\npresent. Enhanced E region ionization created by the precip-\nitation may or may not be present above the absorption layer\nin the absorption scenario, depending on the specific ener-\ngies and fluxes of the precipitating particles, but would not\nbe observable except in oblique traces where the HF could\nreach the E layer through localized holes in the absorbing D\nlayer.\nThe absorption-based scenario would appear to fit best\nwith actual observations from HAARP. For the case shown\nin Fig. 10, ionosonde echoes faded away as the precipitation\nband appeared (Pedersen et al., 2007), suggesting that ab-\nsorption was indeed associated with the precipitation. On the\nother hand, full ionograms were obtained throughout the 26\nMarch 2006 experiment, but did not show any detectable E\nregion or obvious multiple traces in the F region. Some other\ncases of hard subauroral precipitation from HAARP do have\ndetectable E layers, but primarily on oblique traces, consis-\ntent with what would be expected if D region absorption were\npresent below the layer allowing the E region to be observed\nonly from the side after penetrating through holes in the ab-\nsorption layer.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/26\/1089\/2008\/ Ann. Geophys., 26, 1089\u20131099, 2008\n1098 T. Pedersen et al.: Recent optical observations at HAARP\nOne additional test that could be performed in the future\nwould be to examine spatial maps of ionosonde echoes to\ndetermine whether they are restricted to precipitation-free ar-\neas as the artificial optical emissions are, or have some spa-\ntial distribution unrelated to the precipitation pattern. An-\nother test would be to attempt to generate artificial emissions\nat larger angles from the magnetic zenith so the large dif-\nference in altitude between the D region absorption and the\nF region emissions would produce a clearly detectable hori-\nzontal displacement in the pattern between the natural optical\nemissions indicating the location of the precipitation and the\nartificial optical emissions modulated by D layer absorption.\n4 Summary and conclusions\nA number of interesting optical observations have been made\nat the HAARP facility since 2004 but prior to expansion of\nthe transmitter array to its full 3.6 MW power level.\nQuantifiable levels of optical emission from beam swing-\ning experiments across and along the magnetic meridian have\nshown steep cut-offs in emission production by 15\u25e6 zenith\nangle in the magnetic east, west, and north, while in the\nmagnetic south higher production is seen from the vertical\nthrough points south of magnetic zenith. It has yet to be de-\ntermined whether these sharp gradients result from propaga-\ntion conditions or the actual excitation mechanisms.\nHigh temporal resolution observations of short transmitter\npulses and pulse leading edges at 557.7 nm show preferen-\ntial excitation of structures with scale sizes of 5\u201310 km in the\nfirst few seconds of heating which diffuse out somewhat over\ntime during extended heating period but remain relatively un-\nchanged when excited only by short pulses.\nSide-looking altitude profiles from remote observations of\nHAARP artificial optical emissions span a range of 200 km\nand allow excitation mechanisms and the effective lifetime\nof the O (1D) state to be examined over a wide range of\naltitudes. Our estimates of the effective lifetime of O (1D)\ncover an unprecedented altitude range from 190 to 350 km\nand time constants from <20 to >90 s, and are expected to be\na key data source for determining neutral atmospheric densi-\nties. The new HAARPOON remote imager network, which\nutilizes an innovative low-cost mirror-based design, will pro-\nvide automated remote observations to allow routine deter-\nmination of these important parameters.\nImproved optical diagnostics at HAARP have allowed the\ndetection of faint 557.7 nm emissions from highly structured\nhard sub-auroral particle precipitation, which we have shown\nis capable of dramatically modulating the spatial structure of\nionospheric heating and artificial optical emissions by sup-\npressing heating effects in regions occupied by the precip-\nitation. The details of this common but previously unrec-\nognized effect are consistent with localized absorption of the\nHF waves by D-layer ionization enhanced by the particle pre-\ncipitation, although we have suggested additional tests which\ncan be performed to verify the action of this mechanism.\nWith the HAARP transmitter now upgraded to full 3.6\nMW capacity we expect the facility to produce additional\nnew and interesting optical effects, in addition to allowing\nrarely seen effects to be reproduced on a regular basis.\nAcknowledgements.
