GREEN, LA\u00b4SZLO\u00b4 HE\u00b4THELYI, AND NADIA MAZZA\nAbstract. We introduce a strong form of Oliver\u2019s p-group conjecture and de-\nrive a reformulation in terms of the modular representation theory of a quotient\ngroup. The Sylow p-subgroups of the symmetric group Sn and of the general\nlinear group GLn(Fq) satisfy both the strong conjecture and its reformulation.\n1. Introduction\nBob Oliver proved the Martino\u2013Priddy Conjecture, which states that the p-local\nfusion system of a finite group G uniquely determines the p-completion of its\nclassifying space BG [10, 11]. Finite groups are not however the only source of\nfusion systems: the p-blocks of modular representation theory have fusion systems\ntoo, and there are other exotic examples as well. An open question in the theory\nof p-local finite groups claims that every fusion system has a unique p-completed\nclassifying space \u2013 see [1] for a survey article on this field.\nIn [10], Oliver introduced the characteristic subgroup X(S) of a finite p-group S.\nFor odd primes he showed that unique existence of the classifying space would\nfollow from the following conjecture. Recall that J(S) denotes the Thompson\nsubgroup of S generated by all elementary abelian subgroups of greatest rank.\nConjecture 1.1 (Oliver; Conjecture 3.9 of [10]). Let p be an odd prime and S a\nfinite p-group. Then J(S) \u2264 X(S).\nIn [4], the first two authors and Lilienthal obtained the following reformulation\nof Oliver\u2019s conjecture.\nConjecture 1.2 (Conjecture 1.3 of [4]). Let p be an odd prime and G a finite\np-group. If the faithful FpG module V is an F -module, then there is an element\n1 6= g \u2208 \u21261(Z(G)) such that the minimal polynomial of the action of g on V\ndivides (X \u2212 1)p\u22121.\nRecall that V is by definition an F -module if there is an offender, i.e., an elemen-\ntary abelian subgroup 1 6= E \u2264 G such that dim(V )\u2212dim(V E) \u2264 rank(E). Theo-\nrem 1.2 of [4] states that Conjecture 1.1 holds for every p-group S with S\/X(S) \u223c=\nDate: 9 March 2010 (DJG).\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\nG if and only if Conjecture 1.2 holds for G. Note that by [4, Lemma 2.3], every\np-group G does occur as some S\/X(S).\nIn this paper we modify Oliver\u2019s construction of X(S) slightly to obtain a new\ncharacteristic subgroup Y(S), with Y(S) \u2264 X(S) for p odd and Y(S) = S for\np = 2: see \u00a72. We therefore propose the following strengthening of Oliver\u2019s\nconjecture:\nConjecture 1.3. Let p be a prime and S a finite p-group. Then J(S) \u2264 Y(S).\nThis is indeed a strengthening: if p = 2 then Y(S) = S and so Conjecture 1.3\nis true, whereas Oliver\u2019s conjecture is false in general; and for p \u2265 3 we have\nY(S) \u2264 X(S). We recently learnt that Justin Lynd raises the same question in\nhis paper [8]; note that his X3(S) is our Y(S).\nThis conjecture admits a module-theoretic reformulation as well. An element\ng \u2208 G is said to be quadratic on the FpG-module V if its action has minimal\npolynomial (X \u2212 1)2. Note that if V is faithful then quadratic elements must\nhave order p.\nConjecture 1.4. Let p be a prime and G a finite p-group. If the faithful FpG-\nmodule V is an F -module, then there are quadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G)).\nObserve that Conjecture 1.4 is a strengthening of Conjecture 1.2, and trivially\ntrue for p = 2. Our first actual result is the equivalence of the two new conjec-\ntures:\nTheorem 1.5. Let p be an odd prime and G a finite p-group. Then Conjecture 1.3\nholds for every finite p-group S with S\/Y(S) \u223c= G if and only if Conjecture 1.4\nholds for every faithful FpG-module V .\nProof. The proof of [4, Theorem 1.2] adapts easily to the present case, given the\nresults on Y -series and on Y(G) in Lemma 2.1. \u0003\nNote that Conjecture 1.4 holds if G is metabelian or of (nilpotence) class at most\nfour: for though [5, Theorem 1.2] only purports to verify the weaker Conjec-\nture 1.2, the proof that is given there only uses the assumptions of Conjecture 1.4.\nOur main result is the following:\nTheorem 1.6. For n \u2265 1 and a prime p, let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of the\nsymmetric group Sn. Then Conjecture 1.3 holds with S = P , and Conjecture 1.4\nholds with G = P .\nProof. For p = 2 there is nothing to prove, so assume that p \u2265 3. It is well known\n(see [6, III.15]) that P is a direct product P =\n\u220fm\ni=1 Pri , where ri \u2265 1 for all i,\nand Pr is the iterated wreath product Cp o Cp o \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 o Cp with r factors Cp. Recall\nthat the Sylow p-subgroups of Spr are isomorphic to Pr.\nAs P1 \u223c= Cp is abelian, and Pr satisfies Hypothesis 5.2 for r \u2265 2 by Corollary 6.6,\nLemma 5.3 tells us that G = P satisfies Conjecture 1.4.\nSTRONG FORM OF OLIVER\u2019S CONJECTURE 3\nFor Conjecture 1.3, observe that J(G1 \u00d7G2) = J(G1)\u00d7 J(G2) for any groups\nG1, G2. Huppert shows in [6, Satz III.15.4a)] that J(Pr) is an abelian normal\nsubgroup of Pr. Hence J(P ) is abelian and normal in P . So J(P ) \u2264 Y(P ) by\nLemma 2.1 (3). \u0003\nThe fact that they provide the proper degree of generality for the proof of [5,\nTheorem 1.2] was not the only reason for introducing Y(S) and its companion\nConjecture 1.4.\nTheorem 1.7. Let p be a prime and G a finite p-group. Suppose that G satisfies\none of the following conditions:\n(1) G is generated by its abelian normal subgroups; or more generally\n(2) Y(G) = G; or more generally\n(3) \u21261(Z(Y(G))) = \u21261(Z(G)).\nThen Conjecture 1.4 holds for G.\nProof. Clearly (2) \u21d2 (3). For (1) \u21d2 (2), note from Lemma 2.1 (3) that every\nabelian normal subgroup lies in Y(G).\nNow suppose that V is a faithful F -module. Timmesfeld\u2019s replacement theorem\nin the version given in [5, Theorem 4.1] states that there are quadratic elements\nin G. Hence by Lemma 8.1 there are quadratic elements which are late in the\nsense of \u00a78. But Lemma 8.2 says that if a quadratic element is late then it lies in\n\u21261(Z(Y(G))). So if (3) holds then there are quadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G)). \u0003\nFor p \u2265 5, this result has been obtained independently by Justin Lynd: see the\nremark after [8, Lemma 8]. One application of this result is the following:\nTheorem 1.8. Let n \u2265 1, let p be a prime, and let q be any prime power. Let P\nbe a Sylow p-subgroup of the general linear group GLn(Fq). Then Conjecture 1.3\nholds for S = P , and Conjecture 1.4 holds for G = P .\nProof. First we consider the case where q is a power of p (defining characteristic).\nIf we can show that P is generated by its abelian normal subgroups then we are\ndone: for this is condition (1) of Theorem 1.7, which implies both condition (2)\nand the conclusion of that theorem. Now, we may choose P to be the group of\nupper triangular matrices with ones on the diagonal. This copy of P is generated\nby the collection of abelian normal subgroups Ni,j for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, where\nNi,j = {A \u2208 P | Aaa = 1; Aab = 0 for a 6= b whenever a > i or b < j} .\nSee also [13].\nNow we turn to the case where (p, q) = 1 (coprime characteristic). It was\nfirst shown by Weir [12] that P is a direct product of iterated wreath products\nCpr oCp o \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 oCp, where the Cpr is the \u201cinnermost\u201d factor in the wreath product.\nThese iterated wreath products satisfy Hypothesis 5.2 by Lemma 5.6 (1) and\nProposition 6.1. The one exception is of course Cpr , which is abelian. So any\ndirect product of these groups satisfies Conjecture 1.4 by Lemma 5.3.\n4 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\nWe now turn to Conjecture 1.3 in coprime characteristic. As Y(P ) = P if\np = 2, we may assume that p is odd. We shall show that J(P ) is abelian, from\nwhich J(P ) \u2264 Y(P ) follows by Lemma 2.1 (3). Since J(G\u00d7H) = J(G)\u00d7 J(H),\nwe may assume that P is one iterated wreath product. Applying Lemma 5.4, we\nsee that J(P ) is elementary abelian by induction on the number of iterations. \u0003\nThe method of Theorem 1.7 can also be used to show the following:\nTheorem 1.9. Let p be a prime, G a finite p-group and V a faithful FpG-module\nwith no quadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G)). Then the subgroup generated by all\nquadratic elements of G is a proper subgroup of G.\nProof. Let H \u2264 G be the subgroup generated by all last quadratic elements,\nc.f. \u00a78. By Lemma 8.1 we know that H 6= 1. So H \u0002 Z(G), for Z(G) has no\nquadratic elements. Hence CG(H) \f G. But CG(H) contains every quadratic\nelement by Lemma 8.5. \u0003\nStructure of the paper. In Section 2 we construct and study the characteristic\nsubgroup Y(G) of G. We then prove some orthogonality relations in \u00a73 and\nstudy weakly closed elementary abelian subgroups in \u00a74. Then in Section 5 we\nintroduce a hypothesis which constitutes a strengthening of Conjecture 1.4 for\ngroups with cyclic centre. In Section 6 we demonstrate the key property of this\nhypothesis: it remains valid when passing from a group P to the wreath product\nP o Cp = P p o Cp.\nIn Section 7 we introduce the notions of deepest commutators and locally\ndeepest commutators. In Section 8 we use late and last quadratics to demonstrate\nsome lemmas which are required by the proofs of Theorem 1.7 and 1.9. Finally\nwe show in \u00a79 that powerful p-groups satisfy Conjecture 1.4.\n2. A modification of Oliver\u2019s construction\nDefinition. Let p be a prime, S a finite p-group and N E S a normal subgroup.\nA Y -series in S for N is a sequence 1 = Y0 \u2264 Y1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Yn = N of normal\nsubgroups Yi E S such that\n[\u21261(CS(Yi\u22121)), Yi; 2] = 1\nholds for each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. The unique largest normal subgroup N which admits\na Y -series is denoted Y(S).\nLemma 2.1. Let p be a prime and S a finite p-group.\n(1) If 1 = Y0 \u2264 Y1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Yn = N is a Y -series in S and M E S also admits\na Y -series, then there is a Y -series for MN starting with Y0, . . . , Yn.\n(2) There is indeed a unique largest normal subgroup Y(S) admitting a Y -\nseries. Moreover, Y(S) is characteristic in S.\n(3) Every abelian normal subgroup of S lies in Y(S). In particular, Y(S) is\ncentric in S.\nSTRONG FORM OF OLIVER\u2019S CONJECTURE 5\n(4) If p is odd then Y(S) \u2264 X(S). If p = 3 then Y(S) = X(S).\n(5) If p = 2 then Y(S) = S.\nProof. (1) See the corresponding proof for Q-series, at the bottom of p. 334\nin [10].\n(2) Unique existence follows from the first part. It is characteristic because\nit is unique.\n(3) The proof of [10, Lemma 3.2] works for Y(S) as well, even for p = 2.\n(4) If p \u2265 3 then every Y -series is a Q-series. If p = 3 then the two notions\ncoincide.\n(5) If not, then Y(S) < S. Choose T > Y(S) such that T\/Y(S) is cyclic of\norder 2 and contained in \u21261(Z(S\/Y(S))). Then T E S, and we must have\n[\u21261(Z(Y(S))), T ; 2] 6= 1, since Y(S) is centric and the Y -series for Y(S)\ncannot be extended to include T .\nAs Y(S) has index 2 in T , we have t2 \u2208 Y(S) for each t \u2208 T . Hence by\nEqn (2.2) of [5] we have\n[\u21261(Z(Y(S))), t; 2] = [\u21261(Z(Y(S))), t2] = 1 ,\na contradiction. \u0003\nExample. Oliver remarks in [10, p. 335] that X(S) = CS(\u21261(S)) for any finite\n2-group S. So if S is dihedral of order 8, then X(S) = Z(S) is cyclic of order 2,\nwhereas Y(S) = S has order 8. Hence X(S) < J(S) = Y(S) = S in this case.\nExample. Let S = C35 o C5 be the semidirect product in which the cyclic group\non top acts via a (3 \u00d7 3) Jordan block (with eigenvalue 1) on the rank three\nelementary abelian on the bottom. Then C35 = J(S) = Y(S) \f X(S) = S.\nRemark. Let p be an odd prime. The proof of [4, Lemma 2.3] also shows that for\nevery p-group G there is a p-group S with S\/Y(S) \u223c= G.\n3. Orthogonality\nNotation. Suppose that p is an odd prime, that G is a non-trivial p-group, and\nthat V is a faithful (right) FpG-module. Let I be the kernel of the structure map\nFpG \u2192 End(V ). Recall from [5, Section 2] that [v, g] = v(g \u2212 1) for all v \u2208 V ,\ng \u2208 G. Hence [V, g, h] = 0 if and only if (g \u2212 1)(h\u2212 1) \u2208 I.\nFor elements g, h \u2208 G we write g \u22a5V h or simply g \u22a5 h if [g, h] = 1 and\n(g \u2212 1)(h\u2212 1) \u2208 I. Note that \u22a5V is a symmetric relation on G. We write\ng\u22a5 := {h \u2208 G | g \u22a5 h} .\nObserve that 1 6= g \u2208 G is quadratic if and only if g \u22a5 g.\nLemma 3.1. Let V be a faithful FpG-module, where G is a non-trivial p-group.\nFor any g, h, x \u2208 G we have:\n(1) g is quadratic if and only if g \u2208 g\u22a5.\n6 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\n(2) The relation h \u2208 g\u22a5 is symmetric.\n(3) The set g\u22a5 is a subgroup of CG(g).\n(4) For any integer r coprime to p, we have that (gr)\u22a5 = g\u22a5 and therefore\ngr quadratic \u21d0\u21d2 g quadratic.\n(5) Assume that p is odd. If g, h are both quadratic and [g, h] = 1 then\ngh is quadratic \u21d0\u21d2 g \u22a5 h .\n(6) Assume that p is odd. If g is quadratic and [g, gx] = 1 then\ng \u22a5 gx \u21d0\u21d2 [g, x] is quadratic.\nProof. Parts (1) and (2) are clear. Part (3): Obviously g \u22a5 1. If g \u22a5 h and\ng \u22a5 k, then\n(g \u2212 1)(hk \u2212 1) = (g \u2212 1)(h\u2212 1) + h(g \u2212 1)(k \u2212 1)\nand so g \u22a5 hk. Inverses follow, since G is finite.\nPart (4): If g = 1 then there is nothing to prove. If g 6= 1 then r is a unit\nmodulo the order of g. So it suffices to show the inclusion g\u22a5 \u2264 (gr)\u22a5. As gr\nonly depends on the residue class of r modulo the order of g, we may assume\nthat r \u2265 1. Then\ngr \u2212 1 = a(g \u2212 1) for a =\nr\u22121\u2211\ni=0\ngi .\nSo if (g \u2212 1)(h\u2212 1) lies in the kernel I of the representation, then so does (gr \u2212\n1)(h\u2212 1).\nPart (5): From (gh\u2212 1) = (g \u2212 1) + g(h\u2212 1), we get that\n(gh\u2212 1)2 = (g \u2212 1)2 + 2g(g \u2212 1)(h\u2212 1) + g2(h\u2212 1)2\nbecause [g, h] = 1. So since 2g is invertible and (g\u22121)2, (h\u22121)2 \u2208 I, we see that\n(gh\u2212 1)2 \u2208 I if and only if (g \u2212 1)(h\u2212 1) \u2208 I.\nPart (6): By (4) we see that g\u22121 is quadratic if and only if g is; and by (3) we\nhave g\u22121 \u2208 (gx)\u22a5 if and only if g \u2208 (gx)\u22a5. But [g, x] = g\u22121gx. Now apply (5). \u0003\nCorollary 3.2. Let p be an odd prime, G a non-trivial p-group, and V a faithful\nFpG-module. If E = \u3008g1, g2, . . . , gr\u3009 \u2264 G is elementary abelian then the following\nthree statements are equivalent:\n(1) Every element 1 6= g \u2208 E is quadratic.\n(2) g \u22a5 h for all g, h \u2208 E.\n(3) gi \u22a5 gj for all i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , r}.\nNotation. Recall that an elementary abelian subgroup E \u2264 G is called quadratic\n(for V ) if it satisfies the equivalent conditions of Corollary 3.2.\nSTRONG FORM OF OLIVER\u2019S CONJECTURE 7\nProof. Clearly the second statement implies the first. The first implies the third,\nby Lemma 3.1 (5). Now assume the third condition holds. Then E \u2264 (gi)\u22a5 for\nevery i, since (gi)\n\u22a5 is a group (Lemma 3.1 (3)) and contains each gj. So g \u22a5 gi\nfor each i and for each g \u2208 E. Hence gi \u2208 g\u22a5 for every i. Therefore E \u2264 g\u22a5. So\ng \u22a5 h for all g, h \u2208 E, and the second condition holds. \u0003\nLemma 3.3. Suppose that g, h \u2208 G with g 6= 1 and g \u22a5 h. Suppose further that\nC is a subgroup of CG(h) which contains g and has cyclic centre. Then\n\u21261(Z(C)) \u2264 h\u22a5 .\nProof. We proceed by induction on the smallest integer r \u2265 1 with g \u2208 Zr(C).\nIf r = 1 then \u21261(Z(C)) \u2264 \u3008g\u3009, and we are done since \u3008g\u3009 \u2264 h\u22a5. If g \u2208 Zr+1(C),\nthen there is an x \u2208 C such that 1 6= y := [g, x] \u2208 Zr(C). By induction it\nsuffices to show that y \u22a5 h. Since x \u2208 C we have [h, x] = 1 and therefore\nx\u22121(g\u22121)(h\u22121)x = (gx\u22121)(h\u22121), showing that gx \u22a5 h. So y \u2208 \u3008g, gx\u3009 \u2264 h\u22a5. \u0003\nWe close this section by recalling without proof a key lemma from [4].\nLemma 3.4 (Lemma 4.1 of [4]). Suppose that p is an odd prime, that G is a\nnon-trivial p-group, and that V is a faithful (right) FpG-module. Suppose that\nA,B \u2208 G are such that C := [B,A] is a nontrivial element of CG(A,B). If B is\nquadratic, then so is C. \u0003\n4. Weakly closed subgroups\nThis section is related to work of Chermak and Delgado [2], especially the case\n\u03b1 = 1 of their Theorem 2.4.\nNotation. For the sake of brevity we will say that an abelian subgroup A of G is\nweakly closed if A is weakly closed in CG(A) with respect to G. That is, A \u2264 G\nis weakly closed if [A,Ag] 6= 1 holds for every G-conjugate Ag 6= A.\nRemark. Every maximal elementary abelian subgroup M of G is weakly closed,\nsince if M g 6= M but [M,M g] = 1 then \u3008M,M g\u3009 is elementary abelian and\nstrictly larger. Hence every elementary abelian subgroup is contained in a weakly\nclosed one. If the normal closure of E is non-abelian, then every weakly closed\nelementary abelian subgroup containing E is non-normal.\nRemark 4.1. Note that if A \u2264 G is an abelian subgroup and g \u2208 G then\n[A,Ag] = 1 \u21d0\u21d2 [A, [A, g]] = 1 \u21d0\u21d2 [g, A,A] = 1 .\nIn particular, if A is weakly closed (in our sense), then Z2(G) \u2264 NG(A): for if\ng \u2208 Z2(G) then [A, g] \u2264 Z(G) and therefore [A, [A, g]] = 1. Hence [A,Ag] = 1\nand so A = Ag, that is g \u2208 NG(A).\nRemark 4.2. Using GAP [3], the authors have constructed the following examples:\n\u2022 The Sylow 3-subgroup G of the symmetric group S27 contains a rank four\nweakly closed elementary abelian E with E \u2229 Z(G) = 1.\n8 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\n\u2022 The Sylow 3-subgroup G of the symmetric group S81 contains a rank six\nweakly closed elementary abelian E with E \u2229 Z2(G) = 1.\nThe GAP code is available from the first author on request.\nLemma 4.3. Suppose that G is a finite p-group and that the elementary abelian\nsubgroup E of G is weakly closed. Then NG(E) = NG(CG(E)). So if E is not\ncentral in G then NG(E) \r CG(E).\nProof. NG(E) always normalizes CG(E). If x \u2208 G normalizes CG(E) then as E \u2264\nCG(E) we have that E\nx \u2264 CG(E) and therefore [E,Ex] = 1. So Ex = E, for E is\nweakly closed. Hence x \u2208 NG(E). Last part: G is a nilpotent group. So if CG(E)\nis a proper subgroup of G, then it is properly contained in its normalizer. \u0003\nNotation. Let G be a finite group, H \u2264 G a subgroup, and V a faithful FpG-\nmodule. Following Meierfrankenfeld and Stellmacher [9] we set\njH(V ) :=\n|H| \u00b7 |CV (H)|\n|V | \u2208 Q .\nThis means that an elementary abelian subgroup E of G is an offender if and\nonly if E 6= 1 and jE(V ) \u2265 1 = j1(V ).\nLemma 4.4 (Lemma 2.6 of [9]). Let G be a finite group and V a faithful FpG-\nmodule. Let H,K be subgroups of G with \u3008H,K\u3009 = HK. Then\njHK(V )jH\u2229K(V ) \u2265 jH(V )jK(V ) ,\nwith equality if and only if CV (H \u2229K) = CV (H) + CV (K). \u0003\nRemark. As some readers may find the article [9] by Meierfrankenfeld and Stell-\nmacher hard to obtain, we reproduced the proof of this result in our earlier pa-\nper [5, Lemma 3.1] \u2013 though unfortunately we accidentally omitted the necessary\nassumption that \u3008H,K\u3009 = HK.\nRecall that a faithful FpG-module V is called an F -module if it has at least one\noffender.\nProposition 4.5. Suppose that the faithful FpG-module V is an F -module. Set\nj0 = max{jE(V ) | E an offender} .\nThen there is a weakly closed quadratic offender E with jE(V ) = j0.\nMoreover if D \u2264 G is any offender with jD(V ) = j0, then there is such an E\nwhich is a subgroup of the normal closure of D.\nProof. Let D be an offender with jD(V ) = j0. Then D has a subgroup C \u2264\nD which is minimal by inclusion amongst the offenders with jC(V ) = j0. By\nmaximality of j0, the version of Timmesfeld\u2019s replacement theorem in [5, Theorem\n4.1] then tells us that C is a quadratic offender.\nSuppose first that j0 > 1. We shall show that C is weakly closed. If not,\nthen A := \u3008C,Cg\u3009 is elementary abelian for some g \u2208 G with Cg 6= C. Then\nSTRONG FORM OF OLIVER\u2019S CONJECTURE 9\njA(V ) \u2264 j0 by maximality of j0. And since j0 > 1 = j1(V ), we have that\njC\u2229Cg(V ) < j0 by maximality of j0 and minimality of C. But by Lemma 4.4, this\nmeans that\nj20 > jA(V )jC\u2229Cg(V ) \u2265 jC(V )jCg(V ) = j20 ,\na contradiction. So E = C \u2264 D has the required properties.\nNow suppose that j0 = 1. Let g \u2208 G be such that Cg 6= C and [C,Cg] = 1. As\n\u3008C,Cg\u3009 and C \u2229 Cg both have j \u2264 1, Lemma 4.4 means that both have j = 1,\nand (by equality) CV (C\u2229Cg) = CV (C)+CV (Cg). Furthermore, minimality of C\nmeans that C \u2229 Cg = 1, and so CV (C) + CV (Cg) = V . As in the proof of [5,\nLemma 4.3], this means that [V,C,Cg] = 0. Let T \u2286 G be a subset maximal\nwith respect to the condition that E := \u3008Cg | g \u2208 T \u3009 is abelian (and therefore\nelementary abelian). Applying the above argument to any g, h \u2208 T with Cg 6= Ch\nwe deduce that [V,Cg, Ch] = 0. So since each Cg is quadratic, we deduce that E\nis quadratic too. Finally, a repeated application of Lemma 4.4 coupled with the\nfact that j never exceeds 1 tells us that jE(V ) = 1 too. But by construction, E\nis weakly closed and contained in the normal closure of D. \u0003\nIt follows from Proposition 4.5 that Conjecture 1.4 holds for (G, V ) if the following\nconjecture does.\nConjecture 4.6. Let p be a prime, G a finite p-group, and V a faithful FpG-\nmodule. If there is an elementary abelian subgroup 1 6= E \u2264 G which is both\nquadratic on V and weakly closed in CG(E) with respect to G, then there are\nquadratic elements in \u21261(Z(G)).\nWe establish Theorem 1.6 by demonstrating that the Sylow subgroups of the\nsymmetric groups satisfy Conjecture 4.6.\n5. An inductive hypothesis\nWe now present the inductive hypothesis (Hypothesis 5.2) that will be used in\nSection 6 to verify Conjecture 1.4 for an iterated wreath product. First though,\nwe need a few auxilliary lemmas.\nLemma 5.1. Suppose that G is a direct product of the form G = H \u00d7 P , where\nH and P are p-groups. Let E \u2264 G be an elementary abelian subgroup which is\nweakly closed (in CG(E) with respect to G). Set\nF = {g \u2208 P | \u2203h \u2208 H (h, g) \u2208 E} \u2264 P ,\nand set N = NP (F ). Then the following hold:\n(1) F is weakly closed (in CP (F ) with respect to P ).\n(2) 1\u00d7 [F,N ] \u2264 E.\n(3) If E \u0002 H \u00d7 Z(P ), then [F,N ] 6= 1 and therefore E \u2229 (1\u00d7 P ) 6= 1.\nProof. (1) If x \u2208 P and F x 6= F then E(1,x) 6= E and therefore [E,E(1,x)] 6= 1.\nBut [E,E(1,x)] = 1\u00d7 [F, F x]. So [F, F x] 6= 1.\n10 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\n(2) Let f \u2208 F and n \u2208 N . Pick h \u2208 H such that (h, f) \u2208 E. Since [F, F n] =\n[F, F ] = 1, we have [E,E(1,n)] = 1 by the proof of the first part. Hence\nE(1,n) = E, and therefore (1, [f, n]) = [(h, f), (1, n)] \u2208 E.\n(3) F is weakly closed by the first part, and non-central by assumption. Hence\n1 6= [F,N ] \u2264 F by Lemma 4.3. Done by the second part. \u0003\nHypothesis 5.2. Let P be a p-group with the following properties:\n\u2022 P is nonabelian with cyclic centre.\n\u2022 Suppose that H is a p-group and that V is a faithful FpG-module, where\nG = H \u00d7 P . If E \u2264 G is a weakly closed quadratic elementary abelian\nsuch that E \u0002 H \u00d7 Z(P ), then 1\u00d7 \u21261(Z(P )) \u2264 Z(G) is quadratic.\nAt the end of this section (Corollary 5.7) we give some first examples of groups\nthat satisfy this hypothesis. In the next section (Corollary 6.6) we shall show\nthat the Sylow p-subgroups of Spn also satisfy it. First though we explain the\nsignificance of the hypothesis for Oliver\u2019s conjecture.\nLemma 5.3. Suppose that the finite p-group G is a direct product G =\n\u220fn\nr=1Hr,\nwhere each Hr is either abelian or satisfies Hypothesis 5.2. Then G satisfies\nConjectures 1.4 and 4.6.\nProof. For 1 \u2264 r \u2264 n, we shall denote by Kr the product\n\u220f\ni6=rHi. Hence\nG = Kr \u00d7Hr for each r. Note that Z(G) =\n\u220f\nr Z(Hr).\nConjecture 4.6 implies Conjecture 1.4 by Proposition 4.5, and so we assume\nthat there is a weakly closed quadratic elementary abelian subgroup E of G with\nE 6= 1. If E \u2264 Z(G) then every element 1 6= g \u2208 E is a quadratic element\nof \u21261(Z(G)). If E \u0002 Z(G) =\n\u220f\nr Z(Hr) then for some 1 \u2264 r \u2264 n we have\nE \u0002 Kr \u00d7 Z(Hr). It follows that Hr cannot be abelian, and so by assumption\nit satisfies Hypothesis 5.2: which means that the subgroup 1 \u00d7 \u21261(Z(Hr)) of\n\u21261(Z(G)) is quadratic. \u0003\nWe are particularly interested in wreath products of the form G = P oCp, where P\nis a p-group. Recall that this means that G is the semidirect product G = P poCp,\nwhere the Cp on top acts on the base P\np =\n\u220fp\n1 P by permuting the factors\ncyclically. In particular, this means that we may view P p as a subgroup of G.\nWe start with a minor diversion. The following result generalizes [6, Satz\nIII.15.4a)] slightly and is presumably well known. It is needed for the proof of\nTheorem 1.8.\nLemma 5.4. Suppose that p is an odd prime and that P is a p-group such\nthat J(P ) is elementary abelian. Then J(P o Cp) is elementary abelian too. In\nparticular, if P 6= 1 then J(P o Cp) is the copy of J(P )p in the base subgroup\nP p \u2264 P o Cp.\nProof. If P = 1 then P o Cp = Cp is elementary abelian and we are done. So we\nmay assume that P 6= 1, which means that r \u2265 1, where r is the p-rank of P .\nNote that J(P ) \u223c= Crp by assumption.\nSTRONG FORM OF OLIVER\u2019S CONJECTURE 11\nConsider the base subgroup P p, which has index p in P oCp = P p oCp. Since\nJ(G1 \u00d7 G2) = J(G1) \u00d7 J(G2), we see that J(P p) = J(P )p, which is elementary\nabelian of rank pr. So if J(P o Cp) is not elementary abelian then P p o Cp must\ncontain an elementary abelian subgroup E of rank \u2265 pr with E \u0002 P p. We set\nE \u2032 = E \u2229 P p. Since P p has index p in P o Cp, it follows that |E : E \u2032| = p and\ntherefore that E \u2032 \u2264 P p is elementary abelian of rank \u2265 pr\u22121. Furthermore there\nis an element g \u2208 (P o Cp) \\ P p with E = \u3008E \u2032, g\u3009 and therefore [E \u2032, g] = 1.\nWe split P p as P p = A\u00d7B, where A,B \u2264 P p are given by\nA = {(a1, 1, . . . , 1) | a1 \u2208 P} B = {(1, a2, . . . , ap) | ai \u2208 P} .\nNote that E \u2032 \u2229 B must be trivial: for no non-trivial element of B can commute\nwith g \u2208 (P oCp) \\ P p. Hence the projection of E \u2032 onto A is injective. As A \u223c= P\nhas rank r, this means that pr \u2212 1 \u2264 r. This is impossible with p odd and\nr \u2265 1. \u0003\nNow we derive a property of wreath products which will be useful for verifying\nthe hypothesis.\nLemma 5.5. Suppose that G is the wreath product P o Cp, where P is a finite\np-group. Suppose that E is a weakly closed elementary abelian subgroup of G and\nthat either of the following properties is satisfied:\n(1) E is not contained in the base subgroup P p of G.\n(2) Z(P ) is cyclic, E is non-central, and E lies in an abelian normal subgroup\nof G.\nThen \u21261(Z(G)) \u2264 [E,NG(E)].\nProof. The group \u21261(Z(G)) is cyclic of order p. It is generated by (z, . . . , z) \u2208 P p\nfor any element z \u2208 \u21261(Z(P )) with z 6= 1.\nSuppose first that (2) holds. As E lies in an abelian normal subgroup of G and\nis weakly closed, we deduce that E E G. So [E,NG(E)] = [E,G] is normal too.\nMoreover, [E,G] is nontrivial, because E is non-central. Since |\u21261(Z(G))| = p,\nit follows that \u21261(Z(G)) \u2264 [E,G] = [E,NG(E)].\nNow suppose that (1) holds. Pick an element z \u2208 \u21261(Z(P )) with z 6= 1. It\nsuffices to show that (z, . . . , z) \u2208 [E,NG(E)]. We start by showing that c =\n(1, z, z2, . . . , zp\u22121) satisfies c \u2208 Z2(G).\nIf g \u2208 P p then [g, c] = 1, since c \u2208 Z(P p). If g \u2208 G \\ P p then g = h\u03c3, where\nh \u2208 P p and \u03c3 is a cyclic permutation of the p factors of P p. Hence\n[g, c] = [\u03c3, c] = (c\u03c3)\u22121c = (z, z, . . . , z)r \u2208 Z(G) for some 1 \u2264 r \u2264 p\u2212 1.\nTherefore c \u2208 Z2(G) as claimed. By Remark 4.1 if follows that c \u2208 NG(E).\nNow by assumption E \u0002 P p, and so E contains some g = h\u03c3 in G \\ P p. So\nreplacing g by a suitable power if necessary, we may suppose that r = 1, and so\n(z, . . . , z) = [g, c] \u2208 [E, c] \u2264 [E,NG(E)]. \u0003\nThe following lemma gives one way of verifying that the hypothesis is satisfied.\n12 D.

Let G = H \u00d7 P for a p-group H, and let E be a weakly closed quadratic\nelementary abelian subgroup of G with E \u0002 H \u00d7 Z(P ).

Then F is weakly closed (in CP (F ) with respect to P ) by\nLemma 5.1 (1). Moreover, F \u0002 Z(P ), since [F,NP (F )] 6= 1 by Lemma 5.1 (3).\nSo by assumption we may pick g \u2208 Z2(P ) \u2229 [F,NP (F )] with g 6= 1. Since\ng \u2208 [F,NP (F )], we have (1, g) \u2208 E by Lemma 5.1 (2). Hence (1, g) is quadratic\nand of order p. If g \u2208 Z(P ) then we are done, since Z(P ) is cyclic.\nIf g \u2208 Z2(P ) \\ Z(P ) then 1 6= [g, x] generates \u21261(Z(P )) for some x \u2208 P .

In both cases, P is nonabelian and has cyclic centre. Let F \u2264 P be a\nnon-central elementary abelian subgroup which is weakly closed in CP (F ) with\nrespect to P .

Since Cppr is normal abelian, the case F \u2264 Cppr is accounted\nfor by Lemma 5.5 (2).\n(2) Since F is weakly closed and non-central we have CP (F ) \f NP (F ) by\nLemma 4.3. Hence [F,NP (F )] 6= 1. And as the (nilpotence) class of P\nis at most three we have [F,NP (F ), P ] \u2264 Z(P ), whence [F,NP (F )] \u2264\nZ2(P ). \u0003\n6.

Then F \u0002 K, and so by Lemma 5.5 (1) we\nhave \u21261(Z(Q)) \u2264 [F,NQ(F )]. The same thing happens if E \u2264 H \u00d7 Z(K): for\nthen F \u2264 Z(K), which is an abelian normal subgroup of Q. Hence \u21261(Z(Q)) \u2264\n[F,NQ(F )] by Lemma 5.5 (2). In both cases we then deduce from Lemma 5.1 (2)\nthat 1\u00d7 \u21261(Z(Q)) lies in E and is therefore quadratic.\nSo from now on we may assume that E \u2264 H \u00d7 K but E \u0002 H \u00d7 Z(K). That\nis, F is a subgroup of K =\n\u220fp\n1 P , but F \u0002 Z(K) = Z(P )p. Define a subset\nT (F ) \u2286 {1, 2, . . . , p} by\ni \u2208 T (F ) \u21d0\u21d2 F \u0002 P \u00d7 P \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 Z(P )\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 P ,\nwhere the factor Z(P ) occurs in the ith copy of P . Since F \u0002 Z(P )p, we have\nT (F ) 6= \u2205.\nFor 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p we define subgroups Li, P (i) \u2264 H \u00d7K as follows:\nLi = H \u00d7 (P \u00d7 P \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 1\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 P ) P (i) = 1\u00d7 (1\u00d7 1\u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 P \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 1) ,\nwhere the brackets enclose K and the one distinguished factor occurs in the ith\nfactor of K = P p. Then H \u00d7K = Li \u00d7 P (i) for each i. Observe that\ni \u2208 T (F ) \u21d0\u21d2 E \u0002 Li \u00d7 Z(P (i)) . (6.2)\nPick 1 6= \u03b6 \u2208 \u21261(Z(Q)). We need to show that (1, \u03b6) \u2208 Z(G) is quadratic. Note\nthat \u03b6 = (z, z, . . . , z) \u2208 K for some 1 6= z \u2208 \u21261(Z(P )). That is, \u03b6 = z1z2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 zp,\nwhere for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p we define zi \u2208 Z(K) by\nzi = (1, . . . , z, . . . , 1) (z at the ith place).\nNow, the group P (i) \u223c= P satisfies Hypothesis 5.2 by assumption. Applying the\nhypothesis to the direct product group Li\u00d7P (i) = H\u00d7K, we see from Eqn (6.2)\nthat (1, zi) is quadratic for every i \u2208 T (F ). As T (F ) is nonempty and all the\nzi are conjugate in Q under the cyclic permutation of the factors of K = P\np, it\nfollows that every (1, zi) is quadratic.\nFrom Lemma 5.1 (3) and Eqn (6.2) it follows that for every i \u2208 T (F ) there\nis some 1 6= gi \u2208 P such that (1, ki) \u2208 E for ki = (1, . . . , gi, . . . , 1) \u2208 K. Now\nsuppose that i, j \u2208 T (F ) are distinct. Then (1, ki) \u22a5 (1, kj), as they both lie in E.\nApplying Lemma 3.3 with C = P (i), we have that (1, zi) \u22a5 (1, kj). Applying this\n14 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\nlemma a second time, but now with C = P (j), we deduce that\n(1, zi) \u22a5 (1, zj) (6.3)\nholds for all i, j \u2208 T (F ). We have already seen that it always holds for i = j.\nAs Q is the wreath product P o Cp, we may pick an element x \u2208 Q \\K such\nthat (h1, . . . , hp)\nx = (hp, h1, . . . , hp\u22121) holds for all (h1, . . . , hp) \u2208 P p = K. Then\nT (F x) = \u03c3(T (F )), where \u03c3 is the p-cycle (1 2 . . . p). Hence T (F x\nm\n) = \u03c3m(T (F )).\nWe claim that\n\u2200 0 \u2264 m \u2264 p\u2212 1 \u03c3m(T (F )) \u2229 T (F ) 6= \u2205 . (6.4)\nFor if \u03c3m(T (F )) \u2229 T (F ) = \u2205, then [F xm , F ] = 1 by definition of T (F ). But F is\nweakly closed, and so [F x\nm\n, F ] = 1 implies that F x\nm\n= F . But then \u03c3m(T (F )) =\nT (F x\nm\n) = T (F ), and so \u03c3m(T (F )) \u2229 T (F ) = T (F ) 6= \u2205, a contradiction.\nSo Eqn (6.4) is proved. We may rephrase it as follows:\n\u2200 0 \u2264 m \u2264 p\u2212 1 \u2203 a, b \u2208 T (F ) b \u2261 a+m (mod p) . (6.5)\nNow pick any i, j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , p}. By Eqn (6.5) there are a, b \u2208 T (F ) with\nb\u2212 a \u2261 j \u2212 i (mod p). Define r to be the integer 0 \u2264 r < p such that r \u2261 i\u2212 a\n(mod p). Then\ni = a+ r (mod p) and j = b+ r (mod p) .\nHence\n(1, zi) = (1, za)\n(1,xr) and (1, zj) = (1, zb)\n(1,xr) .\nBut (1, za) \u22a5 (1, zb), as this is one of the cases for which we have already demon-\nstrated Eqn (6.3). So we deduce that (1, zi) \u22a5 (1, zj): that is, Eqn (6.3) holds\nfor all i, j. From \u03b6 = z1z2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 zp we therefore deduce by Corollary 3.2 that\n(1, \u03b6) \u22a5 (1, \u03b6), that is (1, \u03b6) is quadratic, as required. \u0003\nCorollary 6.6. The Sylow p-subgroups of the symmetric group Spn satisfy Hy-\npothesis 5.2 for every n \u2265 2.\nProof. By induction on n. It is well known that the Sylow p-subgroups Pn of Spn\nare isomorphic to the iterated wreath product Cp o Cp o \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 o Cp, with n copies of\nCp. So P2 = Cp o Cp satisfies the hypothesis by Corollary 5.7 (1). If Pr satisfies\nthe hypothesis, then so does Pr+1 = Pr o Cp by Proposition 6.1. \u0003\n7. Deepest commutators\nIn this and the subsequent section we assemble the tools needed for the proof of\nTheorems 1.7 and 1.9.\nNotation. Let G be a p-group and g \u2208 G a non-central element. Let r0 = max{r |\n\u2203k \u2208 Kr(G) : [g, k] 6= 1}. This exists by nilpotence, since g is not central.\nIf k \u2208 Kr0(G) and [g, k] 6= 1, then we call [g, k] a deepest commutator of g.\nRemark. Observe that r0(g) = r0(g\nx) for every x \u2208 G.\nSTRONG FORM OF OLIVER\u2019S CONJECTURE 15\nLemma 7.1. Let G be a p-group and g \u2208 G a non-central element.\n(1) g has at least one deepest commutator, and [g, [g, k]] = 1 holds for every\ndeepest commutator [g, k] of g.\n(2) Suppose that k is any element of G such that y = [g, k] satisfies [g, y] = 1.\nThen the order of y divides the order of g.\nIn particular if y 6= 1 and g has order p, then so does y.\nProof. Deepest commutators exist, and commute with g by maximality of r0. If\n1 6= y = [g, k] commutes with g, then gk = gy and so (gpn)k = (gy)pn = gpnypn .\nSo if gp\nn\n= 1 then yp\nn\n= 1. \u0003\nThe concept \u201cdeepest commutator of g\u201d depends not only on the element g, but\nalso on the ambient group G. When we need to stress the group G we shall use\nthe phrase \u201cdeepest commutator in G\u201d.\nNotation. Let G be a p-group, g an element of G, and N a normal subgroup\nof G. If y, x \u2208 L := CG(g)N are such that y = [g, x] is a deepest commutator of g\nin L, then we call y a (G,N)-locally deepest commutator of g. A locally deepest\ncommutator is a (G,N)-locally deepest commutator for some N .\nRemark. Since N is normal, L is a group. By the existence of deepest commuta-\ntors, g has a (G,N)-locally deepest commutator if and only if N \u0002 CG(g).\nLemma 7.2. If y is an (G,N)-locally deepest commutator of g \u2208 G, then y =\n[g, x] for some x \u2208 N .\nProof. We have that y = [g, x\u2032] for some x\u2032 \u2208 CG(g)N , and so x\u2032 = ax for some\na \u2208 CG(g), x \u2208 N . But then gx\u2032 = gx and so [g, x] = y. \u0003\n8. Late and last quadratics\nThroughout this section, G is a finite p-group and V a faithful FpG-module.\nRecall that an element g \u2208 G is called quadratic if its action on V has minimal\npolynomial (X \u2212 1)2.\nNotation. Suppose that g \u2208 G is quadratic. We call g late quadratic if every\nlocally deepest commutator of g is non-quadratic. We call g last quadratic if\nevery iterated commutator z = [g, h1, h2, . . . , hr] with r \u2265 1 and h1, . . . , hr \u2208 G\nis non-quadratic.\nRemark. An element g \u2208 G can only fail to have any locally deepest commutators\nif g \u2208 Z(G), for it is only if g \u2208 Z(G) that N \u2264 CG(g) holds for every N E G.\nIn particular, every quadratic element in Z(G) is late quadratic.\nNote that every last quadratic element is late quadratic. We shall see in\nLemma 8.2 that each late quadratic element has elementary abelian normal clo-\nsure in G. Hence all the non-trivial iterated commutators of a last quadratic\nelement have order p.\n16 D. J. GREEN, L. HE\u00b4THELYI, AND N. MAZZA\nLemma 8.1. If G has quadratic elements, then it has both late quadratic and\nlast quadratic elements.\nProof. As there are quadratic elements we may set\nt0 := max{t | Kt(G) contains a quadratic element} .\nPick a quadratic element g \u2208 Kt0(G) and observe that every commutator lies in\nKt0+1(G). By the maximality of t0, we see that g is both last and late quadratic.\n\u0003\nLemma 8.2. Every late quadratic element g of G lies in \u21261(Z(Y(G))) and there-\nfore satisfies Y(G) \u2264 CG(g).\nProof. We have already observed that all quadratic elements have order p. As\nY(G) is a centric subgroup of G (Lemma 2.1), it suffices to show that each\nquadratic element g of G lies in CG(Y(G)). Let 1 = Y0 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Yn = Y(G) be a\nY -series, so\nYr E G and [\u21261(CG(Yr\u22121)), Yr; 2] = 1 . (8.3)\nWe show that g \u2208 CG(Yr) by induction on r. If r = 0, this is clear. Suppose\nr \u2265 1 and g \u2208 CG(Yr\u22121). If g \/\u2208 CG(Yr) then by Lemma 7.2, g has a (G, Yr)-locally\ndeepest commutator y = [g, x] with x \u2208 Yr. Then [y, g] = 1 by Lemma 7.1, and\n[y, x] = [g, x, x] = 1 by Eqn (8.3). So, as g is quadratic, y is too by Lemma 3.4.\nBut y cannot be quadratic, since y is a locally deepest commutator of the late\nquadratic element g \u2208 G. \u0003\nRemark 8.4. If we were attempting to prove Conjecture 1.4 by induction on |G|\nthen we could assume that it holds for G\/Y(G). By Theorem 1.5 this would\nmean that J(G) \u2264 Y(G). It would then follow from Lemma 8.2 that every late\nquadratic element lies in \u21261(Z(J(G))), the intersection of all the greatest rank\nelementary abelian subgroups of G.\nLemma 8.5. Let H \u2264 G be the subgroup generated by all last quadratic elements.\nThen every quadratic element of G lies in CG(H).\nProof. If not then [g, h] 6= 1 for some elements g, h \u2208 G, with g last quadratic\nand h quadratic. By nilpotency [g, h; r] 6= 1 and [g, h; r + 1] = 1 for some r \u2265 1.\nLet k = [g, h; r \u2212 1]. As the normal closure of g in G is abelian (Lemma 8.2), all\nthe iterated commutators of g commute, and so [[k, h], k] = 1. Also [[k, h], h] =\n[g, h; r+1] = 1. Lemma 3.4 therefore says that 1 6= [k, h] is quadratic, since h is.\nBut [k, h] = [g, h; r] cannot be quadratic, for g is last quadratic. Contradiction.\n\u0003\n9. Powerful p-groups\nWe use L. Wilson\u2019s paper [14] as a reference on powerful p-groups. Recall from\n[14, Definition 1.3] that for an odd prime p, a finite p-group G is called powerful\nif G\u2032 \u2264 Gp := \u3008gp | g \u2208 G\u3009. As in the proof of Proposition 4.5, recall that\nSTRONG FORM OF OLIVER\u2019S CONJECTURE 17\nTimmesfeld\u2019s Replacement Theorem tells us that if V is a faithful F -module\nfor G, then there is an elementary abelian subgroup E of G which is a quadratic\noffender. Our first result improves [5, Theorem 6.2].\nProposition 9.1. Let p be an odd prime and G a finite p-group. If G\u2032 \u2229 \u21261(G)\nis abelian then G satisfies Conjecture 1.4.\nProof. Suppose that V is a faithful FpG-module with no quadratic elements in\n\u21261(Z(G)). We must show that there are no quadratic offenders. So suppose that\nthe elementary abelian subgroup E \u2264 G is a quadratic offender. Then [G\u2032, E] 6= 1\nby [5, Theorem 1.5(2)]. Moreover, G\u2032E E G. Hence G\u2032E \u2229 \u21261(G) E G. By\nthe Dedekind Lemma [7, X.3], we have G\u2032E \u2229 \u21261(G) = E(G\u2032 \u2229 \u21261(G)), since\nE \u2264 \u21261(G). Therefore Z(E(G\u2032 \u2229 \u21261(G))) is an abelian normal subgroup of G,\nand so by [5, Theorem 1.5(1)] it cannot contain E. This means that G\u2032 \u2229 \u21261(G)\nis not centralized by E. So there must be an a \u2208 E such that [G\u2032\u2229\u21261(G), a] 6= 1.\nBut then a \u2208 \u21261(G), and so N := G\u2032\u3008a\u3009 \u2229 \u21261(G) = \u3008a\u3009(G\u2032 \u2229 \u21261(G)) is a normal\nsubgroup of G. Since G\u2032 \u2229 \u21261(G) is abelian, a well-known result (quoted as [5,\nLemma 6.1]) says that the commutator subgroup of N = \u3008a\u3009(G\u2032\u2229\u21261(G)) consists\nof commutators in a. But N E G, and by choice of a we have N \u2032 6= 1. Hence\nN \u2032 has nontrivial intersection with \u21261(Z(G)). So 1 6= [a, x] \u2208 \u21261(Z(G)) for some\nx \u2208 G\u2032 \u2229 \u21261(G). Since a is quadratic, Lemma 3.4 says that [a, x] \u2208 \u21261(Z(G))\nis too. This contradicts our assumption that there are no quadratic elements in\n\u21261(Z(G)). So G satisfies the conjecture. \u0003\nTheorem 9.2. Let p be an odd prime. Every powerful p-group G satisfies Con-\njecture 1.4.\nProof. We refer to Wilson\u2019s paper [14]. His Theorem 4.7 says that Gp is powerful,\nand hence his Corollary 4.11 applied with P = G shows that \u21261(G\np) is powerful.\nOn the other hand, his Theorem 3.1 says that \u21261(G) has exponent p, and so\n\u21261(G\np) = \u21261(G) \u2229 Gp. So \u21261(G) \u2229 Gp is powerful and of exponent p, which\nmeans it must be abelian. As G\u2032 \u2264 Gp, it follows that \u21261(G) \u2229G\u2032 is abelian. So\nG satisfies the conjecture, by Proposition 9.1 above. \u0003\nAcknowledgements.
