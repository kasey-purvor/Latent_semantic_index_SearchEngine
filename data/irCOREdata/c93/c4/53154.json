We apply a transfer functions based upon a \nregional training set of surface sediment samples from estuaries along the Oregon coast. The transfer \nfunction is calibrated to fossil assemblages across sharp peat-mud and peat-sand contacts to provide \npaleomarsh elevations and associated sample-specific errors. The elevation estimates are supported by \nlithological, carbon isotope, and faunal and floral zonation data. Coseismic subsidence from Nehalem \nRiver, Nestucca River, Salmon River, Alsea Bay, Suislaw River and South Slough varies between 0.18 m \nand 0.85 m with associated errors of 0.18 m to 0.32 m. The quantitative estimates with increased \nprecision compared to previous studies have implication for predictions of coseismic subsidence from \nelastic dislocation models, particularly in north-central Oregon. Our estimates constrain strain \naccumulation to 550 yrs or less with equivalent slip on the megathrust between 10 and 30 m, which is \nconsistent with the M9 earthquake for the AD 1700 earthquake.\n2 \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \nContinuing subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North America plate exposes central western \nNorth America to major seismic hazard (e.g., Heaton and Kanamori, 1984; Atwater, 1987; Nelson et al., \n1996a; Clague, 1997). Evidence of repeated mid- and late Holocene plate-boundary earthquakes are \npreserved in intertidal stratigraphic sequences along 1000 km coast of the Cascadia subduction zone \n(Atwater, 1987; Darienzo and Peterson, 1990; Atwater and Hemphill-Haley, 1997; Nelson et al., 1996b). \nSequences of muddy tidal flat sediment that grade upward into the peaty horizons of tidal marsh soils \nform during periods of interseismic strain accumulation with slow relative sea-level (RSL) fall. The peaty \nsoils are abruptly overlain by intertidal mud deposited following sudden coseismic subsidence of coastal \nmarshes with nearly instantaneous RSL rise (e.g., Atwater et al., 1995; Atwater and Hemphill-Haley, \n1997; Nelson et al., 1996b; Shennan et al., 1996; Kelsey et al., 2002; Witter et al., 2003). At some \nlocations, tsunamis accompanying great megathrust earthquakes have abruptly buried marsh surfaces with \nsandy sediment (e.g., Clague et al., 1994; Darienzo et al., 1994; Nelson et al., 2004).  \nEstimating the amount of coseismic coastal subsidence is essential for mapping the coastal extent of \nplate-boundary ruptures and inferring the magnitude of megathrust earthquakes (Leonard et al., 2004; \nHyndman et al., 2005; Nelson et al., 2006). Elastic dislocation models use the amount of coseismic \nsubsidence to assist in the modeling of the length and width of ruptures and the amount of slip on the \nmegathrust. The amount of coseismic subsidence at the surface of the overriding plate is directly related \nto the amount of slip and distance from the trench on the megathrust during rupture, and thus is also \nrelated to rupture length and earthquake magnitude (Hyndman and Wang, 1995; Leonard et al., 2004; \nWang, 2003; Leonard et al., 2010).  \nAll but the most recent estimates of coseismic subsidence at Cascadia are too imprecise to distinguish, for \nexample, elastic from viscoelastic land-level movements (e.g., Wang, 2007), or to infer differences in the \namount of subsidence or uplift from one earthquake cycle to the next (Nelson et al., 2008). Early work at \naccessible outcrops used suddenly buried plant macrofossils with broad elevational ranges to infer sudden \ncoseismic subsidence (e.g., Atwater et al., 1991; Nelson et al., 1996b). Microfossils, such as diatoms and \nforaminifera, have also been used because of their sensitivity to differences in tidal exposure (e.g., \nShennan et al., 1996). For example, Hemphill-Haley (1995) and Atwater and Hemphill-Haley (1997) used \nextensive diatom micropaleontology at southwestern Washington sites to estimate subsidence at 0.8-1.0 \nm (assuming no postseismic uplift) to 3 m (assuming postseismic uplift) during six of seven great \nearthquakes. However, these and other early microfossil studies were also semi-quantitative and relied on \n3 \n \ndifferences between intertidal elevational zones with broad ranges to estimate RSL changes (e.g., Nelson \nand Kashima, 1993; Darienzo et al., 1994, 1995; Hemphill-Haley, 1995, Nelson et al., 1996a; Atwater \nand Hemphil-Haley, 1997; Shennan et al., 1998; Williams and Hutchinson, 2000; Scott et al., 2001; \nHawkes et al., 2005). In the late 1990s, application of transfer function analysis, widely used on \nmicrofossils from deep marine cores to reconstruct climate change, revitalized studies of Holocene sea-\nlevel change on many coasts (e.g., Horton et al., 1999; Gehrels et al. 2001; Horton and Edwards, 2006; \nKemp et al., 2009) including Cascadia (e.g., Guilbault et al., 1995, 1996; Hughes et al., 2002; Sabean, \n2004; Nelson et al., 2008; Hawkes et al., 2010).  \nIntertidal transfer functions develop relations between the relative abundance of microfossil species and \nenvironmental data, such as elevation. Calibration is then used to reconstruct past elevation from \nmicrofossil assemblages in cores or outcrops. When combined with lithostratigraphic data, the RSL \nreconstructions have precisions of \u00b10.1-0.3 m (e.g., Gehrels et al., 2008; Horton and Edwards, 2006; \nKemp et al., 2009; Hawkes et al., 2010). With sufficient sample density, the transfer function provides a \ncontinuous record of RSL change during interseismic parts of the earthquake cycle; essential information \nfor understanding the mechanics of plate-boundary ruptures in subduction zones. \nHawkes et al. (2010) developed a regional transfer function using an intertidal foraminiferal dataset from \nfive Oregon estuaries. In this paper we apply the Hawkes et al. (2010) transfer function to fossil \nforaminiferal assemblages in samples from cores and sections that encompass the AD 1700 earthquake at \nNehalem River, Nestucca River, Salmon River, Suislaw River and South Slough (Figure 1, 2). From \ntransfer function derived paleomarsh elevations, we quantify the amount of sudden RSL rise across the \ncontact between the pre- and post-seismic sediment, and thus infer the amount of coseismic subsidence \nalong 400 km of the Oregon coast. We compare the foraminiferal estimates of coastal subsidence with \npredictions by dislocation modeling of megathrust ruptures (e.g., Leonard et al., 2004, 2010; Hyndman \nand Wang, 1995).  \n2. STRATIGRAPHY OF THE AD 1700 EARTHQUAKE AT FIVE ESTUARIES \nPrecise radiocarbon and tree-ring dating, combined with Japanese historical records, show that an \nearthquake near M9 occurred along the Cascadia subduction zone on 26 January AD 1700, probably \nabout 9pm local time (Nelson et al., 1995; Satake et al., 2003; Atwater et al., 2005). We selected five field \nsites along 400 km of the Oregon coast (Figure 1) to estimate coseismic subsidence from this earthquake. \nTo confirm identification of the contact marking the AD 1700 earthquake, we explored selected sites with \n4 \n \na hand-operated gouge corer using criteria discussed by Atwater et al. (1995) and Nelson et al. (1996b). \nThese criteria include: abrupt stratigraphic contacts <1.5 m below the contemporary marsh surface \nbetween a peaty A or O soil horizon and overlying muddy unit; peaty horizon abruptly overlain by sand \nor silt that may have been deposited by a tsunami; and a peaty horizon that rises inland toward a buried \nPleistocene surface but does not coalesce with other organic-rich horizons. These criteria in conjunction \nwith published and unpublished radiocarbon dates are used to determine the AD 1700 earthquake horizon. \nThe Nehalem River coring site is 6 km up-estuary and protected by a 4 km-long, 0.7-km-wide sand spit \n(Figure 2a). We analyzed a vibracore taken on the south side of the river across from the contemporary \ntraining set of Hawkes et al. (2010). Grant (1994) and Minor and Grant (1996) found widespread \nstratigraphic and plant macrofossil evidence of subsidence during the AD 1700 earthquake exposed in \nbank sections over much of the lower estuary that traces landward for hundreds of meters. A sharp upper \ncontact between the buried peaty horizon, including Native American fire hearths (Woodward, 1990), and \nan overlying muddy or sandy unit infer sudden subsidence during a megathrust earthquake (Grant, 1994; \nMinor and Grant, 1996). The mean age of eight radiocarbon-dated herbs rooted in the top of the buried \npeaty horizon at the outcrop at this site is AD 1666-1950 (179\u00b115 14C yrs BP; Nelson et al., 1995). \nNestucca Bay (Figure 2b) is protected from the ocean by 4-km-long, 0.9-km-wide sand spit. Our sampled \nbank section lies 500 m across the river from the Little Nestucca coring site of Darienzo (1991), Peterson \nand Darienzo (1988), and Darienzo et al. (1994) and north of sites cored by Witter et al. (2009). Between \nNestucca River and Nestucca Bay, the uppermost buried peaty horizon is sharply overlain by intertidal \nmud and in some cases sandy units, inferred to be deposited by tsunamis (Darienzo, 1991; Witter et al., \n2009). Radiocarbon dating near the upper contact of the buried peat indicates between AD 1410-1640 \n(Darienzo, 1991; Darienzo et al., 1994) and AD 1650-1950 from Witter et al. (2009). \nAt Salmon River we sampled a bank section 2 km up-estuary, which is protected by a 0.8-km-long, 0.5-\nkm-wide sand spit (Figure 2c). The contemporary data sampled in Hawkes et al. (2010) lies across the \nriver to the north (Figure 2c). Grant (1994) and Minor and Grant (1996) described a continuous buried \npeaty horizon with a sharp contact to an overlying muddy or sandy unit. The peat included Native \nAmerican fire hearths at one site. The mean of seven radiocarbon-dated herbs rooted in the top of the \nburied peaty horizon is AD 1667-1949 (157\u00b117 14C yrs BP; Nelson et al., 1995, 2004; Bronk Ramsey, \n2009).  \n5 \n \nAt Siuslaw River we took a vibracore on the northeast side of Cox Island, near sites analyzed by Briggs \n(1994) and Nelson et al. (1992b). This part of the estuary is about 9 km up-river and protected by a 5-km-\nlong, 1.5-km-wide sand spit. Hawkes et al. (2010) analyzed the contemporary intertidal zone on the \nnorthwest side of Cox Island (Figure 2d). The stratigraphy at Cox Island is complex; gradational and \nabrupt changes from muddy-peat to peaty-mud to mud are inferred to record both regional sea-level rise \nas well as interseismic and coseismic land-level changes over the last 2000 years (Nelson et al., 1992; \nBriggs, 1994). In a nearby outcrop to our vibracore, four radiocarbon ages from the youngest buried peaty \nhorizon date to the past 400 years, with one date AD 1654-1950. \nThe South Slough core site, in the southwestern arm of the larger Coos Bay estuary, is 3 km from the sea \n(Figure 2e) and is protected by an 8-km-long, 2-km-wide sand spit. A Russian core was taken at Crown \nPoint near the mouth of the slough, near the sites of Nelson et al. (1992, 1998), Darienzo et al. (1994), \nBriggs (1994) and Ota et al. (1995). Contemporary samples in the slough at Hidden Creek marsh are in \nthe training set of Hawkes et al. (2010). Stratigraphy in South Slough and Coos Bay estuary consists of an \nupper buried peaty horizon abruptly overlain by muddy or sandy sediment (Briggs, 1994; Nelson et al., \n1998). Two AMS radiocarbon ages from the uppermost buried peaty horizon in the slough and five from \nthree other marshes in the bay are consistent with the timing of the AD 1700 earthquake (Nelson et al., \n1992, 1996a, 1998). \n3. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n3.1. Sampling and elevation measurement \nSediment sequences encompassing the AD 1700 earthquake were described using the Tr\u00f6el-Smith (1955) \nscheme of classification. Sediments were collected with monoliths from bank section and Russian hand \ncore and vibracores from marsh surfaces. The bank sections and cores were leveled to temporary \nbenchmarks and we continually measured water levels at each site over at least two successive high tides. \nThese measurements were then compared to an independent tidal model that estimates tide levels for \nevery ~3km (nodes) of the Oregon coast (Hawkes et al., 2010). Sediment sequences were sampled for \nforaminifera at 0.01 m intervals above and below the stratigraphical contact of the AD 1700 earthquake. \nWe also sampled for carbon isotopes at South Slough.  \n3.2. Microfossil, carbon isotope, and radiocarbon analyses \n6 \n \nWe followed standard methods for foraminiferal sample preparation and analysis (e.g. Scott and Medioli, \n1980; de Rijk, 1995; Horton and Edwards, 2006). We concentrated foraminifera by washing 3-cm3 \nsamples over 500 \u00b5m and 63 \u00b5m sieves and wet counted up to 300 specimens (where possible) in the 63-\n500 \u03bcm size fraction. Foraminifera were identified with reference to the National Collection of \nForaminifera, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (Plate I, Hawkes et al., 2010). We \nincluded foraminiferal test linings (e.g., Murray and Alve, 1999) and thecamoebians (e.g., Lloyd and \nEvans, 2002) as groups in our fossil assemblages. The occurrence of test linings may reflect post-\ndepositional changes in foraminiferal assemblages (Edwards and Horton, 2000). The preservation of \nforaminifera is effected by the taphonomic processes they undergo during burial (Berkeley et al., 2007). \nFor agglutinated forms, this threat comes from oxygenation of their organic cement and deterioration by \nmicrobes (Berkeley et al., 2007). For calcareous foraminifera, changes in the concentration of carbonic \nacid or bicarbonate and\/or increases in hydrogen sulfide production (driven by the rate at which organic \nmatter is supplied) favor the dissolution of calcium carbonate and therefore calcareous foraminifera (e.g., \nBerkeley et al., 2007).  \nIn sediments at South Slough where foraminiferal abundances are too low or absent for quantitative \npaleoenvironmental reconstruction, we used carbon isotope analyses to determine \u03b413C, total carbon (C), \ncarbon-nitrogen ratio (C\/N) and total nitrogen (N). In general, a change from freshwater peat (-29 \u2030) to \nsaltwater peat (-28 \u2030 up to -20 \u2030) can be geochemically distinguished by >1 \u2030 shift in \u03b413C, although \nthere is some overlap in \u03b413C due to plant type, sediment mixing, and decomposition (Lamb et al., 2007; \nKemp et al., 2010). Following the methodology of Kemp et al. (2010) core samples were treated with 5 % \nhydrochloric acid to remove carbonates, washed in distilled water, and dried before homogenization in an \nagate ball mill. 13C\/12C analyses were performed on treated sediments by combustion in a Carlo Erba \n1500 on-line to a VG TripleTrap and Optima dual-inlet mass spectrometer, with \u03b413C values calculated to \nthe VPDB scale using a within-run laboratory standard (cellulose, Sigma Chemical prod. no. C-6413) \ncalibrated against NBS 19 and NBS 22. Replicate analyses of samples indicated a precision of <0.1 \u2030 (1 \nSD). C\/N ratios were analyzed on the same instrument; the ratios are calibrated with an acetanilide \nstandard. Replicate analyses of well-mixed samples indicated a precision of <0.1 \u2030 (Lamb et al., 2007). \nAMS radiocarbon dating was conducted at Nehalem River and Siuslaw River to identify the AD 1700 \nearthquake horizon within the stratigraphy. Plant macrofossils, such as Triglochin maritima, were used to \nderive precise radiocarbon ages in the underlying peaty-mud below the earthquake contact. Sample \npreparation followed Nelson et al. (2006) and calibrations by INTCAL04 (Reimer et al., 2004).  \n7 \n \n3.4. Foraminiferal training set and transfer function development and calibration \nOur estimates of coseismic subsidence during the AD 1700 earthquake are inferred from RSL changes \nreconstructed from fossil foraminiferal assemblages preserved within the stratigraphic record. Hawkes et \nal. (2010) collected a training set of surface sediment samples from five estuaries along the Oregon coast \n(Nehalem River, Salmon River, Siuslaw River, South Slough and Coquille River) to determine \nforaminiferal distributions and prevailing environmental control(s). They sampled the contemporary \nintertidal zones from above highest astronomical tide to lowest astronomical tide. The samples were taken \nin the fall to avoid the potential seasonal variation associated with the spring and summer species blooms \n(Horton and Edwards 2006; Horton and Murray, 2007). Dominant taxa in the regional dataset include \nBalticammina pseudomacrescens, Trochamminita irregularis, Haplophragmoides wilberti, Trochammina \ninflata, Jadammina macrescens and Miliammina fusca. Using unconstrained cluster analysis and \ndetrended correspondence analysis Hawkes et al. (2010) identified two elevation-dependent faunal zones: \nFaunal Zone I (upland, high marsh, middle marsh) dominated by Balticammina pseudomacrescens, \nHaplophragmoides wilberti and Trochammina inflata, and Faunal Zone II (low marsh and tidal flat) \ndominated by Miliammina fusca. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial CCA inferred that \nthe zonation of foraminifera is elevation-dependent and subsequently a statistically significant transfer \nfunction to reconstruct changes in RSL could be developed. Since sites with differing tidal ranges are \ncombined to form single training sets, it was necessary to standardize the elevation of each sample to take \nthese differences in vertical range into account. This was achieved by converting the elevation of each \nsample to a standardized water level index (SWLI) following Horton and Edwards (2006): \nSWLI = (Elevationab \u2013 MLLWb)\/MHHWb - MLLWb)      (Eq. 1) \nwhere Elevationab is the elevation of sample a at site b (measured in m mean tide level, MTL); MLLWb is \nthe mean low low water at site b (m MTL); and MHHWb is the mean high high water a site b (m MTL). \nThe results of a weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) transfer function using a regional \ntraining set indicate a robust performance between the observed and foraminiferal-predicted elevations \n(r2jack = 0.90).  \nIn this paper we calibrate the transfer functions to fossil assemblages to provide paleomarsh elevations \nand sample-specific errors. The predicted values of SWLI are converted to estimates of elevation by \nrearranging Equation 1 and inputting the appropriate tidal parameters for the site from which the fossil \nsequence was recovered. This back-transformation process results in the elevations being expressed in \n8 \n \nmeters relative to MSL. We estimate coseismic subsidence in sedimentary sequences using the following \nequations: \nSC = Epre - Epost            (Eq. 2) \nwhere, coseismic subsidence (SC) is estimated by subtracting the paleomarsh elevation of the pre-seismic \nsample (Epre) within the buried peaty horizon from the post-seismic sample (Epost) in the overlying clastic \nunit. We disregard samples from inferred tsunami deposited sediments.  \nSC error = \u221a[(Epre error)2 + (Epost error)2]        (Eq. 3) \nwhere, the coseismic subsidence error (SC error) is calculated from the sample-specific Epre error and Epost \nerror provided by the WA-PLS transfer function. \nFollowing this methodology, Hawkes et al. (2010) calibrated the transfer function to a fossil sequence at \nAlsea Bay of the AD 1700 earthquake to address previous inconsistent transfer function reconstructions \nbetween foraminifera and diatom training sets (Nelson et al., 2008). Estimates of coseismic subsidence \nfor the AD 1700 earthquake using foraminifera were 0.40 m \u00b1 0.19 m and 0.16 m \u00b1 0.12 m using \ndiatoms. Nelson et al (2008) noted that evaluation of subsidence estimates are complicated by fossil \nforaminifera with 30% \u2018no close\u2019 analogues, because the contemporary dataset lacked species \nencountered in the fossil samples. Increasing the environmental diversity in the contemporary dataset \nimproves the likelihood of a modern analogue. Hawkes et al. (2010) applied their transfer function to the \nfossil foraminiferal data of Nelson et al. (2008). The expanded regional dataset with a consistent \ntaxonomy produced an estimate of coseismic subsidence (0.18 \u00b1 0.31 m) with each of the fossil samples \npossessing a matching analogue. The foraminiferal-predicted coseismic subsidence was comparable to the \nreconstruction using a diatom-based transfer function.  \n3.5. Evaluating the completeness of estuarine sedimentation \nA concern over using microfossil methods to reconstruct coseismic and immediately postseismic land-\nlevel changes is that too little tidal sediment may be deposited in the first few weeks following coseismic \nmovements (Hemphill-Haley, 1995; Leonard et al., 2004). Following Guilbault et al. (1996), Hughes et \nal. (2002) and Nelson et al. (2008) we infer that no breaks of weeks or more in tidal sedimentation \noccurred following great earthquakes and accompanying tsunamis, if a tsunami-deposit overlies buried \npeaty horizons, and that deposit grades upward into tidal mud with no identifiable disconformities. At \n9 \n \nsuch sites, we infer that sedimentation was continuous and that microfossil assemblages reflect \nelevational environments to the same extent that they do during interseismic periods with lower \nsedimentation rates. Further support is provided by the colonizing ability of foraminifera, which are \ncapable of colonizing within weeks of a disturbance, such as an earthquake (e.g., Alve, 1995; Alve and \nGoldstein, 2002; Langezaal et al., 2003; Horton et al., 2009).  \nThe study of foraminiferal abundance and composition within fossil samples assists with identifying \ntsunami deposits where a change in lithology is uncertain (Hawkes et al., 2007). The composition of \nassemblages transported by tsunami inundation and backwash may be distinct because turbulent tsunami \nwaves inundate coastal inland areas transporting and redepositing marine and brackish foraminifera (e.g. \nHawkes et al., 2007; Mamo et al., 2009). We apply the modern analogue technique (MAT) to identify \nthese allochthonous assemblages (Birks, 1995). Because the foraminiferal assemblages within tsunami \nsediments are not included in the contemporary training set, dissimilarity coefficients for these samples \nare often high. The maximum dissimilarity coefficient of the contemporary training set of Hawkes et al. \n(2010) is used as a threshold between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018no close\u2019 analogue in the fossil samples (Woodroffe, \n2009). The modern analogue technique should indicate \u2018no close\u2019 modern analogues for the assemblages \ntransported by tsunami inundation.  \n4. RESULTS \n4.1 Nehalem River \nAt Nehalem River we sampled a peaty horizon sharply overlain (contact \u22642 mm) by sandy silt, which \nrepresents the AD 1700 earthquake. The buried peat, from 1.32 m to 1.22 m depth, consists of a grey-\nbrown silty-clay with organic material including roots and wood fragments (Figure 3a). The foraminiferal \nassemblages from the peat indicate a high to middle marsh environment dominated by H. manilaensis, B. \npseudomacrescens and T. irregularis (Hawkes et al., 2010).The overlying light brown-grey silty fine sand \n(1.22 m to 1.08 m depth) has minimal root and plant fragments. The foraminiferal assemblage is \ndominated by M. fusca and J. macrescens indicating a switch to a low marsh-tidal flat environment.  \nTransfer function reconstructions showed that paleomarsh elevations throughout the buried peat range \nbetween 1.02 m and 1.33 m MSL supporting the foraminiferal and lithological interpretations of a high to \nmiddle marsh depositional environment. We estimate the pre-seismic (Epre) elevation was 1.02 \u00b1 0.21 m \nfrom 1.22 m depth; MAT indicates the sample has a good analogue. Reconstructing post-seismic sample \n10 \n \n(Epost) in the overlying clastic unit is complicated because of the absence of an obvious stratigraphic unit \nindicative of tsunami deposition. However, between 1.22 m and 1.15 m depth MAT identified three \nsamples with \u2018no close\u2019 analogues. Further planktonic species and high abundances of Ammobaculites sp., \na taxon indicative of subtidal environments at Nehalem, are present. The occurrence of these species \nlikely represents deposition by tsunami (Dawson et al., 1996; Mamo et al., 2009). Therefore, we have \nselected 1.14 m depth to represent the post seismic sample (Epost = 0.53 \u00b1 0.23 m).  MAT indicates this \nsample has a good analogue and the foraminiferal data are indicative of a low marsh-tidal flat \nenvironment, which supports the lithological data. Using Equations 2 and 3 we estimate 0.49 m \u00b1 0.31 m \nof coseismic subsidence at Nehalem River. \n4.2 Netucca River \nAt Nestucca River we sampled a peaty horizon between 1.12 m to 1.05 m depth, which is composed of \nbrown organic-rich clayey-silt with root fragments (Figure 3b). The buried peat is sharply overlain \n(contact \u22641 mm) by 0.06 m of medium gray sand from 1.05 m to 0.99 m depth. The sand grades upward \ninto a grey silt from 0.99 m to 0.80 m depth. B. pseudomacrescens and H. wilberti dominated the \nforaminiferal assemblage in the peat indicating a high to middle marsh environment. B. \npseudomacrescens and H. wilberti are also present in the sand but at much lower total abundances. In \ngrey silt the foraminifera indicate a low marsh environment derived from an assemblage dominated by J. \nmacrescens and M. fusca.  \nReconstruction of paleomarsh elevations in the peaty horizon ranged between 1.28 m and 1.44 m MSL. \nWe estimate the pre-seismic (Epre) elevation from the sample immediately below the stratigraphic contact \n(1.05 m depth) to be 1.38 m \u00b1 0.20 m MSL. Selecting a reconstructed post-seismic sample in the \noverlying clastic unit is straightforward because the sand unit has been interpreted to be a tsunami deposit \n(Darienzo, 1991; Darienzo et al., 1994; Witter et al., 2009). Further, MAT showed a \u2018no close\u2019 analogue \nfor one sample in the tsunami sand at 1.02 m depth. The post-seismic sample above the sand (Epost = 0.95 \nm depth) provides a paleomarsh elevation of 0.91 m \u00b1 0.20 m MSL. Coseismic subsidence is estimated to \nbe 0.47 m \u00b1 0.28 m. \n4.3 Salmon River \nAt Salmon River we sampled a peaty horizon composed of dark grey organic-rich silt from 1.09 m to 0.99 \nm depth (Figure 3c). The peat is sharply overlain (contact \u2264 2 mm) by 0.04 m thick dark grey coarse sand. \nThe sand grades into a grey clayey-silt from 0.95 m to 0.85 m depth. The peat is composed of a \n11 \n \nforaminiferal assemblage containing B. pseudomacrescens, T. inflata and H. wilberti indicating a high \nmarsh environment. The sand has a mixed foraminiferal assemblage, including marine and brackish taxa. \nThe assemblage in the clayey-silt is dominated by M. fusca and J. macrescens indicating a low marsh \nenvironment, although the sample at 0.91 m depth has anomalously high relative abundances of J. \nmacrescens (75 %). \nThe transfer function reconstructions varied between 1.33 m to 1.44 m MSL in the peaty horizon and \nbetween 0.52 m and 0.96 m MSL in the clayey-silt. We estimate the pre-seismic (Epre) elevation from the \nsample immediately below the stratigraphic contact (0.99 m depth) to be 1.41 m \u00b1 0.21 m MSL. The sand \nbetween 0.99 m to 0.95 m depth has been interpreted by Grant (1994) and Nelson et al (1995, 2004) to be \na tsunami deposit. Further MAT showed a \u2018no close\u2019 analogue for the foraminiferal assemblage at 0.94 m \ndepth. We reconstruct the post-seismic elevation (Epost) from the overlying sample (0.93 m depth), which \nis 0.81 m \u00b1 0.20 m MSL. We estimate coseismic subsidence to be 0.60 m \u00b1 0.29 m. \n4.4 Siuslaw River \nAt Siuslaw River we sampled a brown organic-rich peat that occurs between 0.64 m to 0.56 m (Figure \n3d). The peat is sharply overlain (\u22641 mm contact) by a 0.04 m-thick fine grey sand. The upper contact of \nthe sand at 0.52 m depth is relatively abrupt (3 mm) and is overlain by a brown-grey clayey-silt, \nsuggesting incomplete estuarine sedimentation. The foraminiferal assemblages within the peat are \ndominated by B. pseudomacrescens and T. inflata, indicative of a high marsh environment. This \nassemblage is abruptly replaced in the sand with a low abundance, monospecific assemblage of J. \nmacrescens. Foraminifera were absent from samples 0.53 m and 0.52 m depth. The clayey-silt is also \ndominated by high relative abundances of J. macrescens with two monospecific samples at 0.50 m and \n0.49 m depth.  \nReconstructions for the transfer function in the peaty horizon were between 1.08 m to 1.32 m MSL. The \npre-seismic (Epre) elevation from the sample immediately below the stratigraphic contact (0.56 m depth) is \n1.08 m \u00b1 0.21 m MSL. The sand from 0.56 m to 0.52 m depth has been interpreted to be a tsunami \ndeposit. MAT showed \u2018no close\u2019 analogues for samples both within the sand and overlying clayey silt due \nto high relative abundances of J. macrescens, which do not occur in the training set of Hawkes et al. \n(2010). The selected post-seismic elevation (Epost) of 0.67 m \u00b1 0.22 m MSL from 0.51 m depth is \npotentially unreliable. Due to problems of analogues in the modern dataset and incomplete sedimentation \n12 \n \nsuggested by the lithology following the earthquake, we tentatively estimate coseismic subsidence to be \n0.42 m \u00b1 0.30 m.  \n4.5 South Slough \nWe sampled a dark brown peaty horizon from 0.60 m to 0.40 m depth, which is sharply overlain (3 mm \ncontact) by a thin 3 cm coarse grey sand at South Slough. The sand grades into a grey silty-clay from 0.38 \nm to 0.30 m depth (Figure 3e). At the base of the peat from 0.60 to 0.56 m depth the foraminiferal \nassemblage is dominated by T. irregularis and B. pseudomacrescens indicating a high marsh \nenvironment. Foraminifera are absent within the remainder of the peat, suggesting a freshwater \nenvironment. Carbon isotope analyses showed a change in composition at 0.56 m depth (-25.0 to -27.5 \u2030 \nin \u03b413C), which supports a transition from salt marsh toward freshwater depositional environment (Lamb \net al., 2007; Kemp et al., 2010). From 0.54 m to 0.40 m depth, high percentages of total organic carbon \nand total nitrogen imply the peaty horizon is an upland soil (Lamb et al., 2007). At the contact with the \noverlying sand, total organic carbon and total nitrogen decrease reflecting a return from freshwater to \nbrackish conditions (Lamb et al., 2007). Very low abundances of foraminifera are found at the upper \ncontact of the sand, but numbers increase within the silty-clay. The assemblage is composed of T. inflata \nand J. macrescens indicative of a middle marsh environment. Anomalously high abundances of T. \nirregularis are found at 0.55 depth, which are absent in the modern environment (Hawkes et al., 2010). \nThe absence of foraminifera and carbon isotope analyses indicate that the peat below the stratigraphic \ncontact of the AD 1700 earthquake is a freshwater environment forming above highest astronomical tide. \nIn the modern transect at South Slough (Hawkes et al., 2010) foraminifera are absent above 1.55 m MSL, \nthus providing a minimum pre-seismic (Epre) elevation. In the silty clay, foraminifera produced estimates \nof paleomarsh elevations between 0.70 m and 1.16 m MSL, which all have good matching analogues. The \npost-seismic (Epost) elevation from the sample (0.38 m depth) immediately above the tsunami sand \n(Briggs, 1994; Nelson et al., 1998) is 0.70 m \u00b1 0.18 m. The minimum coseismic subsidence is 0.85 m.  \n5. COSEISMIC SUBSIDENCE OF AD 1700 EARTHQUAKE \nGrant (1994) and Minor and Grant (1996) suggested that Nehalem River experienced a change from a \nspruce forest to a Triglochin maritima colonized mudflat, producing 1 m to 2 m coseismic subsidence. \nWe measured substantially less subsidence (0.49 \u00b1 0.31 m) at the more seaward of their two most-studied \nsites. We believe the published studies overestimated the amount of subsidence, because Triglochin \nmaritima is also common in the modern low and middle marsh environments (Eilers, 1975; Hawkes et al., \n13 \n \n2010). Triglochin maritima is also much more resistant to decay than many other marsh plants, and so \nmay persist in the sediments of buried low and middle marshes after other species have decomposed. At  \nNestucca River estimates of coseismic subsidence from Darienzo (1991), Peterson and Darienzo (1988) \nand Darienzo et al. (1994) overlap (0.5 m-1.5 m) at the lower end with estimates from the foraminiferal-\nbased transfer function (0.47 m \u00b1 0.28 m). The published studies were based upon lithology, qualitative \ndiatom analysis, percent organic content, and the presence of Triglochin maritima plant macrofossils \npresumed to be indicative of a mudflat.  \nThe foraminiferal transfer function derived estimates 0.60 \u00b1 0.29 m at Salmon River are consistent with \nprevious studies. Nelson et al. (2004) used limited pollen and plant macrofossil data to estimate 0.3 to 1.0 \nm of coseismic subsidence during the AD 1700 earthquake. Grant (1994) and Minor and Grant (1996) \nused lithology and macrofossils to estimate that as little as 0.5 m or as much as 1.0 m of subsidence could \nhave changed a high marsh to an unvegetated tidal flat in AD 1700. \nAt Siuslaw River the estimated amount of coseismic subsidence varies as the result of complex \nstratigraphy. Briggs (1994) used lithology, qualitative diatom analysis, and organic content to infer \nsubsidence of 1.0 m to 2.0 m during the AD 1700 earthquake. Alternatively, Nelson (1992) interpreted \ngradual changes between peat and mud lithofacies at Siuslaw River as reflecting coseismic subsidence of \n<1 m and probably <0.5 m. Our quantitative estimate of coseismic subsidence (0.42 m \u00b1 0.32 m) supports \nlower values, although the transfer function results are compromised by \u2018no close\u2019 analogues in overlying \nclastic sediments where the Epost sample is selected. \nPrevious estimates of coseismic subsidence during the AD 1700 earthquake in South Slough are \ncomparable. Nelson et al. (1992, 1996a, 1998) using changes in lithology and plant macrofossils suggest \nsubsidence >0.5 m. Briggs (1994) estimated that for a supratidal marsh or forest surface to be buried by \nmuddy sediments would require a minimum subsidence of 1.0 m to 2.0 m. Estimates of coseismic \nsubsidence from a foraminifera-based transfer function developed by Nelson et al. (2008) including the \nfossil data of Nelson et al. (1996a) and contemporary data of Jennings and Nelson (1992) produced \nsubsidence estimates of 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 m. Our regional foraminiferal-based transfer function calculates a \nminimum elevational change of 0.85 m near the mouth of South Slough.  \nThe differences in magnitude and uncertainty of coseismic subsidence between our quantitative \nreconstructions using a consistent methodology and the qualitative estimates based upon a variety of \n14 \n \nlithological and macro- and microfossil methods are manifest in Leonard et al. (2004, 2010) compilation \nof estimates for the AD 1700 earthquake from British Columbia to Northern California (Table 1). \nNotwithstanding the large errors (uncertainties of typically \u00b1 0.5-0.8 m), Leonard et al.\u2019s (2004, 2010) \ndatabase proposes coseismic subsidence of up to 2 m for the Oregon coastline. We find that our \nquantitative estimates (0.18 m to \u2265 0.85 m) are lower, especially at Nehalem and Ne stucca rivers. As \nsuggested by Nelson et al. (2008), modest coseismic subsidence estimates for the Oregon coast restrict \nplate boundary ruptures from extending far inland. Hyndman (2005) showed that by varying the width of \nthe rupture zone, using values consistent with uncertainties in the thermal and geodetic seismogenic zone, \nhad little effect on surface deformation. Hyndman (2005) inferred that surface deformation is primarily \naffected by slip along the shallower part of the megathrust. But if the amount of slip is equal to the \namount of strain accumulation (550 yrs or 800 yrs), an increase in rupture width increases the magnitude \nof vertical deformation of the surface. The same results can also be modeled by varying the amount of \nmegathrust slip (Leonard et al., 2004). \nLeonard et al. (2004) compared coseismic subsidence from the database of the A.D. 1700 megathrust \nearthquake with predictions from elastic dislocation models constrained by geophysical (geodetic, \nthermal, seismic) data of Okada (1985), Hyndman and Wang, (1993, 1995) and Fl\u00fcck et al. (1997). The \nstudy showed that a simple elastic dislocation model of the seismic release of 550-800 years of \naccumulated strain can produce coastal subsidence generally consistent with the database. Leonard et al. \n(2004) concluded that the penultimate great megathrust event to have occurred ~600-1000 years prior to \nthe A.D. 1700 earthquake (e.g., Atwater and Hemphill-Haley, 1997). However, turbidite analyses and \nsome coastal data place the penultimate event at only 200 years prior to A.D. 1700 (e.g., Goldfinger et al., \n2008). We find that the transfer function estimates of subsidence for Nehalem River, Alsea Bay and South \nSlough are comparable to modeled strain accumulation rate of 550 years or less and do not overlap the \n800 year rate. However, Nestucca River, Salmon River and Siuslaw River overlap both the 550 year and \n800 year accumulation rates (Figure 4a). The assertion of a lower strain rate supports the more recent \nstudy of Leonard et al. (2010). Aware of differences in the precision of studies of coseismic subsidence, \nthey graded the estimates into three quality levels and compared these observations with predictions of \ncoastal subsidence based on the CAS3D elastic dislocation model (Wang et al., 2003). Leonard et al. \n(2010) concluded that the Oregon coastline is broadly consistent with the pattern of coseismic \ndisplacements predicted for the full release of strain accumulated over 500 years.  \nEstimation of slip magnitude in the AD 1700 earthquake was possible through comparisons between \nuniform slip model predictions and the coseismic subsidence database (Leonard et al., 2004, 2010). Their \n15 \n \nbest-fit slip pattern (Figure 4b) suggested the region of greatest slip in northern Oregon (\u226530 m), \ndecreasing along the coast to the south to less than 10 m. Our transfer function-derived estimates of \ncoseismic subsidence indicate a near-constant coseismic slip. No sites suggest 50 m of slip on the \nmegathrust. Nehalem River, Alsea Bay and South Slough infer less than 20 m of slip whereas Nestucca \nRiver, Salmon River and Siuslaw River suggest between 20 m and 30 m of slip. Fault rupture of 10\u201330 m \nis consistent with the M 9 earthquake (Leonard et al., 2004, 2010). \nLeonard et al. (2004, 2010) noted that in southern Oregon subsidence estimates, even with the large errors \nincluded in the database, are significantly less than predicted by the elastic dislocation models. The \nsimple models did not include the complex deformation near the Mendocino triple junction, thus the \ncoastal data may be better fit by a model with a 25% narrower rupture (Leonard et al., 2010). Leonard et \nal. (2010) concluded that future studies should focus on the transfer function methodology used in this \npaper to increase the quality and reduce the uncertainty (\u00b1 0.2-0.3 m) of coseismic subsidence estimates, \nparticularly in southern Oregon. \n6. CONCLUSIONS \nIt has long been established that the interchange between terrestrial and marine sediments can provide \ninformation on RSL change and plate boundary earthquakes. Paleoseismologists infer the amount of \ncoseismic subsidence during plate-boundary earthquakes from lithostratigraphic and plant macrofossil \nchanges in across sharp peat-mud and peat-sand contacts. However, the use of lithostratigraphic-based \nreconstructions is associated with a number of limitations, and these become particularly significant when \nexamining low amplitude (>1 m), short period (hours-days) variations that occur during a plate-boundary \nearthquake. Reconstructed paleomarsh elevations derived from applying the Hawkes et al. (2010) \nforaminiferal-based transfer function were used to estimate coseismic subsidence immediately following \nthe AD 1700 giant earthquake from stratigraphic sequences at five salt marshes along the Oregon coast. \nThe results at Nehalem River indicated 0.49 m \u00b1 0.31 m of coseismic subsidence; Nestucca River 0.47 m \n\u00b1 0.28 m and Salmon River 0.60 m \u00b1 0.29 m; and Alsea Bay 0.18 m \u00b1 0.31. Estimates from Siuslaw \nRiver of 0.42 m \u00b1 0.32 m, must be observed with caution due to \u2018no close\u2019 matching analogues in the \npost-earthquake sediments. At South Slough we estimate minimum coseismic subsidence of 0.85 m \nbecause foraminifera are absent in the pre-earthquake sediments. Coseismic subsidence estimates are \nsupported lithostratigraphy and faunal zonation, and carbon isotope analyses. AD 1700 giant earthquake \ncoseismic subsidence estimates produced by the foraminiferal-based transfer function are quantitative and \nreduce uncertainty when compared to previous qualitative estimates. Comparisons to modeled predictions \n16 \n \nof Leonard et al (2004, 2010) point to strain accumulation of 550 yrs and slip on the megathrust of \nbetween 10-30 m.  \n8.
