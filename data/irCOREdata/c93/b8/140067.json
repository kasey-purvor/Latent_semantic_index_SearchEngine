Building on \nprior research, we suggest that there are three levels of dynamic capabilities which \nare related to managers\u201f perceptions of environmental dynamism. At the first level \nwe find incremental dynamic capabilities: those capabilities concerned with the \ncontinuous improvement of the firm\u201fs resource base. At the second level are \nrenewing dynamic capabilities, those that refresh, adapt and augment the resource \nbase. These two levels are usually conceived as one and represent what the \nliterature refers to as dynamic capabilities. At the third level are regenerative \ndynamic capabilities, which impact, not on the firm\u201fs resource base, but on its current \nset of dynamic capabilities i.e. these change the way the firm changes its resource \nbase. We explore the three levels using illustrative examples and conclude that \nregenerative dynamic capabilities may either come from inside the firm or enter the \nfirm from outside, via changes in leadership or the intervention of external change \nagents. \n \nKey words \nDynamic capabilities; Environmental dynamism; Managers; Resource-based view \n \n3 \nDynamic capabilities: \nAn exploration of how firms renew their resource base \n \nIntroduction \nThe concept of dynamic capabilities (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece et \nal., 1997) has evolved from the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm (Barney, \n1986, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984). RBV proponents argue that simultaneously valuable, \nrare, inimitable and non-substitutable resources can be a source of superior \nperformance, and may enable the firm to achieve sustained competitive advantage \n(Barney, 1991). Dynamic capabilities have lent value to the RBV arguments as they \ntransform what is essentially a static view into one that can encompass competitive \nadvantage in a dynamic context (Barney, 2001a, b). Dynamic capabilities are \u201cthe \ncapacity of an organization to purposefully create, extend or modify its resource \nbase\u201d (Helfat et al., 2007, p. 1) and over the last few years the concept has received \nmuch attention in the form of publications (e.g. Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Helfat \nand Peteraf, 2003; Teece et al., 1997; Zollo and Winter, 2002) and conference \npresentations (e.g. Academy of Management meeting 2004-2006; Strategic \nManagement conference 2004-2006). However, as highlighted in the British Journal \nof Management Special Call for Papers on \u201eThe Practice of Dynamic Capabilities: \nTheory Development and Research\u201f and by Helfat et al. (2007) the concept is still in \nneed of theoretical and empirical development.  \nIn this paper we aim to develop the notion conceptually. Specifically we build \non the work of Teece et al. (1997), Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) and Helfat et al. \n(2007) concerning what constitutes a dynamic capability and on the suggestions \nfrom Collis (1994), Danneels (2002), Winter (2003), and Zahra et al. (2006) that \n4 \nthere are hierarchies of capabilities. We begin by explaining dynamic capabilities as \nthey are currently understood. Then, adapting the extant work on hierarchies of \ncapabilities, we propose that there are three distinct types of dynamic capabilities. \nFirst, starting with Eisenhardt and Martin\u201fs (2000) argument that dynamic capabilities \nmay also be used in stable environments, we suggest that the generic concept of \ndynamic capabilities can be decomposed into two distinct levels: incremental \ndynamic capabilities and renewing dynamic capabilities. Then building on Winter\u201fs \n(2003) paper where he mentions that dynamic capabilities may need to be refreshed, \nwe propose that the firm may also need \u201eregenerative\u2019 dynamic capabilities. We \nexplain that the resulting effect of a regenerative dynamic capability is that it renews \nthe firm\u201fs current set of dynamic capabilities. We also propose that each level of \ndynamic capability will be applied according to managerial perceptions of \nenvironmental dynamism i.e. that the trigger to use different levels of change \ncapability is a function of managerial perceptions of the need for change. Clearly, the \ndegrees of organizational change associated with each level of capability vary from \nminor, where incremental capabilities are being applied, through to major where \nregenerative capabilities are introduced. Moreover, we would expect incremental \nchanges to the resource base to be an almost continuous process, renewal of \ndynamic capabilities to be applied periodically, and regenerative capabilities to be \ninfrequently experienced. This raises interesting questions about the extent to which \nregenerative and indeed renewing capabilities can be viewed as repeated \nperformances, or routines. We take up this issue later in the paper. \nWe also take into account managerial perceptions of both the internal and \nexternal environments that impact on their decisions to use different levels of \ndynamic capabilities (Stimpert and Duhaime, 1997; Weick, 1979). Managerial \n5 \nperceptions affect managerial behaviour and specifically their behaviour towards the \nrenewal of their firm\u201fs resource base (Adner and Helfat, 2003; Helfat et al., 2007). \nWe take the position that the current beliefs managers hold about whether their \norganization is successful, and their perceptions of the firm\u201fs environment, should be \na primary focus of inquiry. This argument has been well rehearsed in the literature \n(see for instance Anderson and Paine, 1975). This perspective allows us to adopt a \ncontingency approach to our analysis as we discuss different levels of dynamic \ncapability in different environmental states. Aragon-Correa and Sharma (2003) also \ntake this stance and like them here we are answering the call from many RBV \nauthors for a contingency perspective on the RBV (Barney, 2001a; Priem and Butler, \n2001a, b). Hence, we take the view that what counts is the perceived environment \nand perceived resources (Crotty, 1998; Weick, 1979), and that manager\u201fs \nperceptions, as suggested by Adner and Helfat (2003), are critical determinants of \nthe decisions to develop and deploy different forms of dynamic capability. It also \nmeans, following from Helfat et al. (2007, p. 20), we recognise that managers \u201chave \nparticular importance for dynamic capabilities\u201d and that to fully understand dynamic \ncapabilities we need to consider what they perceive and act upon in terms of their \nenvironment and resources. Expressed differently, it also means that we are \nessentially taking a micro perspective of organizations; we acknowledge that it is \nindividuals and what they do that matters (Felin and Foss, 2005; Orlikowski, 2002).  \nAfter the description of the three levels of dynamic capabilities we discuss \nwhether dynamic capabilities necessarily lead to advantage, and then consider some \nmanagerial implications of these ideas. We conclude with some areas for future \nresearch and a summary. \n \n6 \nTheoretical background \nDynamic capabilities have been defined as \u201cthe capacity to renew competencies so \nas to achieve congruence with the changing business environment\u201d by \u201cadapting, \nintegrating, and reconfiguring internal and external organizational skills, resources, \nand functional competencies\u201d (Teece et al., 1997, p. 515). More recently, Helfat et al. \n(2007, p. 1) have defined a dynamic capability as \u201cthe capacity of an organization to \npurposefully create, extend or modify its resource base\u201d. It is this definition that we \nhave adopted to facilitate the development of our argument. In line with Helfat et al. \n(2007) we use the term \u201eresource\u201f in its broad sense (Barney, 1991), and hence it \nincludes activities, capabilities, etc., which allow the firm to generate rents.  \n Danneels (2002) argues that it is essential for the RBV to have a dynamic \nperspective, so as to understand how firms evolve over time, through their \ndeployment and acquisition of resources, and because firms must continuously \nrenew and reconfigure themselves if they are to survive (see also Zahra et al., 2006). \nOur paper attempts to further the understanding of how firms reconfigure themselves \nby \u201eunpacking\u201f the notion of dynamic capability into three levels, one of which \naddresses the renewal of firms\u201f extant dynamic capabilities. \nDynamic capabilities are built rather than bought in the market (Makadok, \n2001). They are organizational processes in the most general sense (Helfat et al., \n2007) or routines (Zollo and Winter, 2002) which may have become embedded in the \nfirm over time, and are employed to reconfigure the firm\u201fs resource base by deleting \ndecaying resources or recombining old resources in new ways (Simon and Hitt, \n2003).  \nThis means that dynamic capabilities are viewed to be essentially path \ndependent (Dierickx and Cool, 1989), as they are shaped by the decisions the firm \n7 \nhas made throughout its history, and the stock of assets that it holds (Eisenhardt and \nMartin, 2000; Zollo and Winter, 2002). Path dependency \u201cnot only defines what \nchoices are open to the firm today, but\u2026also puts bounds around what its internal \nrepertoire is likely to be in the future\u201d (Teece et al., 1997, p. 515). Path dependency \ncould be grounded in knowledge, resources familiar to the firm (Monteverde and \nTeece, 1982), or influenced by the social and collective nature of learning (Teece et \nal., 1997).  \nThis suggests that learning plays a significant role in the creation and \ndevelopment of dynamic capabilities. This is illustrated, for instance, by Eisenhardt \nand Martin (2000) and Zollo and Winter (2002) who explain that learning is at the \nbase of dynamic capabilities, and guides their evolution (for a fuller discussion on the \ngenesis and evolution of dynamic capabilities, see Zollo and Winter, 2002). Learning \nis also considered as a dynamic capability itself, rather than an antecedent of it. As \nsuch, learning as a dynamic capability has been identified as \u201ca process by which \nrepetition and experimentation enable tasks to be performed better and quicker\u201d \n(Teece et al., 1997, p. 520). Zollo and Winter (2002, p. 339) attempted to meld these \ntwo positions by explaining that \u201cdynamic capabilities are shaped by the co-evolution \nof learning mechanisms\u201d.  \nHelfat and Peteraf (2003) emphasise that to qualify as a dynamic capability, a \ncapability not only needs to change the resource base, but it also needs to be \nembedded in the firm, and ultimately be repeatable. Those are key issues in the \ndynamic capability conversation, and we have addressed these criteria in our \nfollowing theoretical development of the dynamic capability construct.  \n Dynamic capabilities are argued to comprise of four main processes: \nreconfiguration, leveraging, learning and integration (Bowman and Ambrosini, 2003 \n8 \nbased on Teece et al., 1997). Reconfiguration refers to the transformation and \nrecombination of assets and resources, e.g. the consolidation of manufacturing \nresources that often occurs as a result of an acquisition. Leveraging refers to the \nreplication of a process or system that is operating in one area of a firm into another \narea, or extending a resource by deploying it into a new domain, for instance \napplying an existing brand to a new set of products. As a dynamic capability, \nlearning allows tasks to be performed more effectively and efficiently, often as an \noutcome of experimentation, and permits reflection on failure and success. Finally, \nintegration refers to the ability of the firm to integrate and coordinate its assets and \nresources, resulting in the emergence of a new resource base.  \n \n \n \nHierarchies of dynamic capabilities \nAs discussed in the introduction our aim is to extend the dynamic capabilities \nargument and propose that there are three main orders or levels of dynamic \ncapabilities, including dynamic capabilities that not only change the resource base, \nbut which can also change a firm\u201fs extant set of dynamic capabilities. Before going \nfurther we explore the current literature on the subject of hierarchies or orders of \ndynamic capabilities. \nCollis (1994) first proposed that there might be distinct levels of dynamic \ncapability. He suggested four categories of capabilities, the first being the resource \nbase itself. The second and third categories, which Collis (1994) explains are closely \nrelated and difficult to distinguish, are both dynamic capabilities in terms of both \nTeece et al.\u201fs (1994) and Helfat et al.\u201fs (2007) definitions given earlier (Winter (2003) \n9 \ntakes a similar line). In broad terms both Collis (1994) and Winter (2003) distinguish \nbetween the modification of the resource base and the creation and extension of the \nresource base. The fourth category is what Collis (1994) labels \u201ehigher order\u201f or \n\u201emeta-capabilities\u201f and it relates to learning-to-learn capabilities. He also states that \nmeta-capabilities can go on ad infinitum, there is a kind of infinite wave of capability \nto renew the capability that renews the capability etc. Thus dynamic capabilities that \nimpact upon current dynamic capabilities can be seen to be, to use Collis\u201f (1994) \nterm, meta-capabilities. Danneels (2002) is one of a few authors to develop Collis\u201f \n(1994) ideas. He proposed two competency types: first-order competencies, which \nconstitute the ability to achieve an individual task; and second-order competencies: \nthe firm\u201fs ability to renew itself through creating new first-order competencies. These \ncontributions hint at circumstances similar to those we consider here, however we \nwould view Danneels\u201f (2002) first order capabilities as being the firm\u201fs extant \nresource base, the resources that allow the firm to directly earn a living (Winter, \n2003), and his second order capabilities refer to dynamic capabilities that enable the \ncreation of new resources. Danneels (2002) does not explicitly consider the issue of \nhow dynamic capabilities themselves might be changed. \nWinter (2003) further progressed the idea of a capability hierarchy. His \nhierarchy begins with operating capabilities or \u201ezero-level\u201f capabilities which allow \nfirms to earn a living in the present (in other words, these are the resource base). He \nthen describes first\u2013order capabilities that allow for a change in zero-order \ncapabilities to occur, for example they effect changes to the production process. \nFinally he considers higher-order capabilities that are the outcome of organizational \nlearning which result in creating or modifying a firm\u201fs dynamic capabilities. However, \nlike Collis (1994), he does not discuss this capability in great depth.  \n10 \nIn other research, Brady and Davies (2004) posit that fundamental changes in \nthe environment, or shifts in the firm\u201fs position, must be responded to innovatively, \nby exploring unknown alternatives and renewing capabilities, and Zahra et al. (2006, \np. 947) advocate that an \u201cinfinite spiral of capabilities to renew capabilities could be \nconceived\u201d. They further comment that these capabilities would have the ability to \nchange how the firm solves its problems: \u201ca higher-order dynamic capability to alter \ncapabilities\u201d (Zahra et al., 2006, p. 921). \nHence, we build on the work of Danneels (2002), Winter (2003), and Zahra et \nal. (2006) to aid us in developing a better understanding of dynamic capabilities. It is \nworth noting that the notions of orders or hierarchies of change have been explored \nin other literature, particularly in the fields of organizational learning (Argyris and \nSchon, 1974, 1978; Bateson, 1972) and organizational change (Watzlawick et al., \n1974). While, within the confines of this paper, we will not review such literature, we \nacknowledge that these complementary fields have influenced the dynamic \ncapability literature and the work on orders of dynamic capabilities. \nArgyris and Schon (1974), who draw on Bateson\u201fs (1972) research, explain \nthat single-loop learning permits the correction of errors by making changes to \nroutine behaviour and therefore allowing the organization to continue along its \ncurrent course. Argyris and Schon (1978) explain that with single-loop learning \nindividuals react to changes in their internal and external environment, yet the only \nlearning that occurs is consistent with what is already known in the organization, and \nthe only change that takes place is within the norms of the organization.  \nIn contrast, organizations have difficulty with double-loop learning, where \nerrors are corrected for by examining the fundamental state of the organization, and \nmaking modifications to, for example, its norms, values and objectives (Argyris and \n11 \nSchon, 1974, 1978). They explain that change must happen to the organization\u201fs \nnorms because the usual error-correction methods are not sufficient to counter the \nchange in the internal or external environment. Individuals recognise that they \n\u201ccannot correct it (an error) by doing better what they already know how to do\u201d \n(Argyris and Schon, 1978, p. 22). To progress they must instead restructure the \norganizational norms i.e. learning must take place (Argyris and Schon, 1978).  \nThe change literature also discusses changes that alter existing change \nprocesses. Watzlawick et al. (1974) explain that there are two types of change: first-\norder change that \u201coccurs within a given system which itself remains unchanged\u201d, \nand second-order change \u201cwhose occurrence changes the system itself\u201d (Watzlawick \net al., 1974, p. 10). The authors explain second-order change as a type of reframing \nof a problem, because first-order change only explicates the problem further, as it is \nnot enough of a change to alter the situation or develop a solution. In broad terms we \ncan see how Winter\u201fs (2003) second order of dynamic capabilities can be associated \nwith single loop learning and first-order change as they effect changes to the \nresource base, but the way that these changes are performed do not change. \nWinter\u201fs (2003) higher order of dynamic capabilities can be related to double loop \nand second-order change as they are transformational in nature.  \nIn what follows we extend this literature by first considering managerial \nperceptions of environmental dynamism, and by proposing three distinct levels of \ndynamic capabilities: incremental dynamic capabilities, renewing dynamic \ncapabilities and regenerative dynamic capabilities. \n \n12 \nEnvironmental states and dynamic capabilities \n The initial rationale for developing the concept of dynamic capabilities derived \nfrom a concern that the RBV appeared to apply primarily to firms in essentially static \nenvironments (Priem and Butler, 2001a). Resource advantages that may have been \nbuilt up over many years through path dependent development processes would \nhave enduring rent generating potential only if the environments the firms compete in \ndid not undergo significant change, i.e. if the environment was stable. In stable \nenvironments there are external changes, but these changes are largely predictable \nand incremental, and the rate of change is low, relative to that experienced by other \nfirms in other environments (Duncan, 1972; Mintzberg, 1979). In these \ncircumstances we would presume that the resource stock remains essentially stable. \nIn contrast, where firms are facing fast paced change, unpredictable events and \nunanticipated discontinuities in dynamic environments (D\u201fAveni, 1994), resource \nadvantages are likely to be rapidly eroded. In such a context the firm\u201fs ability to \ncreate, adapt and reconfigure resources, i.e. its dynamic capabilities, is critical; firms \nneed to refresh their resource stock to have an advantage. In the following section, \nbuilding first on Eisenhardt and Martin\u201fs (2000) argument that dynamic capabilities \nare at play in both stable and dynamic environments we explain that the current \nnotion of dynamic capabilities can be decomposed into two distinct types: \nincremental dynamic capabilities and renewing dynamic capabilities. Then, building \nupon Winter\u201fs (2003) \u201ehigher-order capabilities\u201f we argue how a third type of dynamic \ncapability (regenerative dynamic capabilities) are necessary for the renewal of \ndynamic capabilities. \nBefore embarking upon this elaboration we explain our cognitive approach to \nthe notions of a stable or dynamic environment. As we have discussed the RBV and \n13 \ndynamic capability literature implicitly or explicitly distinguishes between these two \nbroad states of the environment. The RBV explains what the sources of sustained \nadvantage are in stable environments, and the dynamic capability view offers an \nexplanation as to how firms can sustain resource-based advantages in dynamic \nenvironments. However as highlighted in the introduction, and reported by Anderson \nand Paine (1975), there is a large body of evidence which shows that realised \nstrategies reflect managerial perceptions rather than objective characteristics (Child, \n1972; Duncan, 1972). Hence when considering environmental dynamism it is critical \nto do so in terms of, firstly, whether managers perceive that there are changes in \ntheir external environment, and secondly if they perceive their firm needs to change. \nIn other words, we have two types of change: external and internal. Managers may \nperceive that environmental conditions are stable or changing. Externally perceived \nchanges might include competitors\u201f introducing new products, shifts in government \nlegislation, or changes in customer needs. Managers may also decide to instigate \ninternal changes independent of any perceptions that the external environment is \nchanging. These changes might be triggered by dissatisfaction with current \nperformance, the imposition of budgeting restrictions, or may reflect the desire of a \nnew manager to make an impact. So following Helfat et al.\u201fs (2007) definition that \ndynamic capabilities are purposefully applied, managerial perceptions of the need to \nchange are critical triggers for the performance of dynamic capabilities. To \nsummarise, we would argue that to understand dynamic capabilities we need to \nconsider managerial perceptions of the need for change, which are functions of their \nperceptions of their external and internal (firm) environments (e.g. see Hambrick and \nMason, 1984). These perceptions may or may not act as triggers to either change \nthe resource base, or to change the way the resource base is changed. Thus it is \n14 \nentirely possible for managers in objectively dynamic environments, to mis-perceive \nthe need for change and hence fail to apply appropriate dynamic capabilities (we \ndevelop this issue later on in the discussion section). Alternatively, managers may \ntrigger change where they are driven by internal pressures for enhanced \nperformance. \nTaking all this into account means that a perceived stable environment is an \nenvironment where external or internally triggered changes are largely seen by \nmanagers to be predictable and incremental, with a low rate of change. A perceived \ndynamic environment is an environment where managers perceive fast paced \nchange, and even unpredictable changes and unanticipated discontinuities.  \n  \nIncremental dynamic capabilities \nWhere an essentially stable environment is perceived there would still be some \nrequirement to adapt the resource stock of the firm. Although the pace of change is \nslow and the extent of change is limited, requirement for incremental adjustments \nand improvements to the resource stock of the firm would remain. Thus, even in \nstable environments there is likely to be a need for continuous improvement, but the \nresource stock would not be transformed through these change processes, it would \nbe incrementally adjusted and adapted. Continuous improvement is sufficient to \nensure that the resource stock maintains its value in this relatively stable context. \nContinuous improvement relates to the continual and often small adjustments that a \nfirm makes to its products or operations (Bessant and Caffyn, 1997). This form of \ndynamic capability describes processes that effect changes, albeit incremental \nchanges, to the resource base of the firm. Thus we label this first level of dynamic \ncapability as incremental. An example might be that of e2v, and the company\u201fs \n15 \nconstant improvement of their waste management and energy use. To ensure \nmaximum energy usage they keep reconfiguring their processes and systems so that \nthey reduce energy consumption; they work on being able to recycle more and more \nwaste in terms of quantity e.g. tonnes of cardboard and types e.g. paper, oils, \nsolvents, etc. This suggests that dynamic capabilities do not only happen in a \u201erapidly \nchanging environment\u201f (Teece et al., 1997), but that our argument is in line with \nEisenhardt and Martin (2000) who explain that in more stable market contexts \ndynamic capabilities are simple and iterative, and rely on the incremental and \ncontinuous improvement of extant resources. Moreover, these incremental dynamic \ncapabilities are likely to be repeatable and embedded in the firm (Helfat and Peteraf, \n2003; Helfat et al., 2007). Thus these processes of continual improvement would be \nstable patterns of the firm (Zollo and Winter, 2002). Hence although this type of \ndynamic capability brings an adaptive change to the resource base, the ways these \nchanges are effected do not change. \n \nRenewing dynamic capabilities \nThis is the situation most commonly referred to in the dynamic capability literature, \nnotably by Teece et al. (1997), Eisenhardt and Martin (2000) or Helfat et al. (2007) (it \nalso refers to Winter\u201fs (2003) first order capabilities). These dynamic capabilities are \nutilised to sustain a rent stream in changing environments, they refresh and renew \nthe nature of the resource stock, rather than incrementally adapt it. They are needed \nas resource-based advantages in dynamic environments may well be rapidly eroded. \nExamples of such dynamic capabilities would, for instance, include brand extension \nsuch as those undertaken by Virgin, or process replication as performed by Sony. \nVirgin has generated new resources by deploying its valuable brand into new \n16 \ndomains e.g. airlines, mobile phones, cosmetics, bridal wear, cola, railways. As far \nas Sony is concerned they have applied their know-how in miniaturization to all their \nproducts e.g. radio, hi-fi, computers or personal navigation.  \n As the environment shifts, resource advantages can become disadvantages if \nno attempts are made to refresh the resource stock. As Leonard-Barton (1992) \nexplains, valuable resources can become core rigidities if they are not modified, \ncombined with different equipment or extended for new use, such as to produce new \nproduct lines. These renewing dynamic capabilities are of a different order to \nincremental dynamic capabilities. They are not merely about continual, incremental \nchanges; they are concerned with modifying the resource stock in such a way that its \nutility is altered so that rent generation is sustained. So we could differentiate \nincremental dynamic capabilities from renewing capabilities as follows. Where \nincremental capabilities are applied the resource stock remains essentially the same, \nbut the resources undergo continuous development or evolution. For example, a \nsuccessful brand might be continually updated to keep its value over time e.g. the \nKitKat chocolate bar that has been around for seventy years has undergone periodic \nadjustments and enhancements, but the basic brand remains essentially stable. In \ncontrast, where renewing capabilities are employed new resources are either \ncreated, introduced, or resources are combined in new ways. Hence a renewing \ncapability would be the introduction of new product lines, or the extension of a brand \ninto a new product application e.g. a KitKat lunch box.  \n These second level dynamic capabilities are developed and embedded within \nthe firm as they progress through time, via the accumulation of experience and \nspecific investments (Makadok, 2001; Maritan 2001; Zollo and Winter, 2002). \nSustaining these dynamic capabilities is an essential requirement for any firm to \n17 \ncontinue having a resource base which allows them to earn a living (Winter, 2003), \nthus the costs of sustaining dynamic capabilities is most likely inevitable for any firm \nin a dynamic environment (Bowman and Ambrosini, 2003). Some firms may try to \navoid incurring these costs, but they take a risk of not being able to appropriately \nrenew their resource base. \n The current literature tends not to distinguish between incremental dynamic \ncapabilities and renewing dynamic capabilities, they are usually described as one: \nthey are explained as being \u201edynamic capabilities\u201f. Both of these levels are used for \nchanging the resource base. However whilst incremental dynamic capabilities are \nabout adjusting, and incrementally improving \u201cthe current resource base in the \ndirection of more of the same\u201d (Helfat et al., 2007, p. 1), renewing dynamic \ncapabilities are concerned with \u201cthe capacity of an organization to purposefully \ncreate, extend, or modify its resource base\u201d (Helfat et al., 2007, p. 1) to sustain a \nrent stream. Without such renewing of dynamic capabilities the organization would \nnot be able to \u201csurvive and prosper under conditions of change\u201d (Helfat et al., 2007, \np. 1).  \n In this section we have elaborated upon the concept of dynamic capabilities: \nfirst we have highlighted that while dynamic capabilities are necessary to face \nenvironmental changes, we need to consider managerial perceptions of \nenvironments, rather than purely objective environmental measures, as perceptions \nimpact upon realised strategies and the deployment of dynamic capabilities. \nSecondly we argued that \u201edynamic capabilities\u201f can be understood at two distinct \nlevels. We now turn our attention to the way firms can change, not their resource \nstock, but their extant set of dynamic capabilities, i.e. we now consider how firms \n18 \nmight modify and extend their current dynamic capabilities. We call these higher \nlevel capabilities \u201eregenerative dynamic capabilities\u201f.  \n \nRegenerative dynamic capabilities  \nWhen current dynamic capabilities are perceived to be insufficient to impact \nappropriately upon a firm\u201fs resource base the dynamic capabilities themselves need \nto be renewed. In other words, the firm needs to change the way it purposefully \ncreates, extends or modifies its resource base (Helfat et al., 2007). In these \ncircumstances a firm needs a set of dynamic capabilities to act upon the extant set of \ncurrently embedded dynamic capabilities, thus allowing it to change its resource \nbase in new ways. These regenerative dynamic capabilities allow the firm to move \naway from previous change practices, towards new dynamic capabilities. \nRegenerative dynamic capabilities are likely to be deployed by firms whose \nmanagers perceive that the environment is turbulent, where external changes are \nnon-linear and discontinuous (D\u201fAveni, 1994). As Zahra et al. (2006) explain in \nvolatile environments such as in high-technology industries firms need to repeatedly \nreconfigure their set of valuable resources and as a corollary they need to be able to \nhave the capacity to modify their current dynamic capabilities. The presence of these \nregenerative dynamic capabilities can be inferred, as it may help explain why some \nfirms find success in the face of environmental turbulence, whilst their competitors \nfail (Danneels, 2002). Indeed many firms facing a discontinuous environment are not \nable to overcome their own organizational inertia and have failed (Gilbert, 2005), as \nthey have not changed internally themselves (Miller and Friesen, 1980; Tushman \nand Romanelli, 1985). Gilbert (2005) reports that part of the problem is a failure to \nalter the processes that use the resources (Leonard-Barton, 1992; Nelson and \n19 \nWinter, 1982), we argue here that firm failure could be attributed to managers using \nthe extant set of dynamic capabilities, when these are not appropriate for the new \nenvironment.  \nIf an environment is perceived to be novel or rapidly changing, firms may \nneed to move away from previous dynamic capabilities towards new ones suitable to \nthe new environment (Brady and Davies, 2004). This means that the purpose of \nregenerative dynamic capabilities would be to embed new, or to improve extant, \ndynamic capabilities. Regenerative dynamic capabilities like any other dynamic \ncapabilities come in many forms, but they may be very similar to the renewing \ncapabilities e.g. they might involve restructuring, learning, leverage, but the key \ndifference is that whereas renewing capabilities operate directly on the resource \nbase, regenerative capabilities impact on the renewing or incremental dynamic \ncapabilities. As such they have an indirect impact on the resource base. Thus the \nregenerative capability would impact the extant renewing capabilities at t1, leading to \nchanges in these renewing capabilities in t2, which ultimately lead to new resources \nbeing created in t3.  \nThis leads to the question of the extent to which regenerative dynamic \ncapabilities can be considered to be in any way repeated performances; one of the \nrequirements for an activity or process to be labelled a capability (Helfat et al., 2007). \nWe address this issue in a following section. In figure 1 we summarise how the three \nlevels relate to each other and to the resource base, and in table 1 we show how \nthese levels relate to the previous literature. \nInsert Figure 1 about here \nInsert Table 1 about here \n \n20 \nIf we consider the four main dynamic capabilities of reconfiguration, \nleveraging, learning and integration2 (Bowman and Ambrosini, 2003), where a firm \ncurrently uses only the leveraging capabilities a regenerative dynamic capability \nwould allow it to develop, for instance, a reconfiguration dynamic capability, e.g. to \ndevelop the ability to identify and integrate appropriate acquisitions. Alternatively, \nthey may develop an integration dynamic capability allowing it to develop a culture \nencouraging collaboration, experimentation and hence facilitating innovation. \nTherefore the regenerative dynamic capability would act to change dynamic \ncapabilities by either changing the form of the dynamic capability (e.g. from leverage \nto reconfiguration) or altering the mix of capabilities (adding leverage to and existing \nreconfiguration capability). For example, an SBU may have the extant dynamic \ncapabilities of leveraging best practices within its boundaries; the regenerative \ndynamic capability would extend the leveraging processes to encompass other \nrelated SBUs in the corporation. In what follow we offer two case examples. \n Founded in 1979, International Greetings (IGR) is one of the world's leading \nmanufacturers of greetings products (International Greetings, 2007). In the early \nyears, IGR renewed its resource base essentially through learning which led to new \nproduct developments (e.g. in new types of greetings card; gift wrapping, crackers, \nstationery and accessories) and leverage, notably through the acquisition of \ncharacter licenses e.g. Shrek, The Simpsons, Harry Potter. It also focused on the UK \nmarket. Recently, to avoid pressures on margins IGR moved production to Eastern \nEurope and China whilst still creating products and leveraging licenses very \nsuccessfully. Then to achieve growth IGR embarked on a series of acquisitions in \nthe US, Netherlands, and Germany. This suggests that IGR, having grown through \n                                                 \n2\n We used this list for convenience, but any other list of dynamic capabilities could be used (e.g. Eisenhardt and \nMartin, 2000; Teece et al., 1997). \n21 \nthe 1980s and 1990s by refreshing their resource base via leverage and learning, \nfound that these dynamic capabilities were insufficient to enable profit growth in the \nmore competitive environment facing them since 2000. However rather than \nabandoning its leverage and learning processes, it augmented these capabilities by \nembarking on two forms of reconfiguration: the transferring of production to lower \ncost countries, and the acquisition of other firms. This augmenting of dynamic \ncapabilities is evidence of the exercise of regenerative activity. No dynamic \ncapabilities have been eliminated, and new capabilities have been introduced. The \nregenerative dynamic capabilities can be seen here as being about learning (Teece \net al., 1997) as IGR basically renewed its dynamic capabilities by enhancing existing \ncapabilities and identifying new opportunities for their use. \n GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) also provides an interesting illustration of \nregenerative dynamic capabilities in operation (Heller, 2007). Since the 1950s the \nresource base of large pharmaceutical companies has consisted of patented drugs \nwith regulatory approval. This resource stock has been continually refreshed through \nR&D activity, which essentially consisted of testing thousands of chemical entities for \ntheir efficacy in treating a range of illnesses. Drug companies had built up learning \ndynamic capabilities through the establishment and development of teams of \nspecialist researchers, and other groups who were skilled in the extensive phases of \ntesting required for regulatory approval. In the 1980s and early 1990s a series of \nmajor mergers and acquisitions led to consolidation in the industry (e.g. Glaxo \nmerging with Smith Kline, who earlier combined with Beecham). But in the mid \n1990s, GSK acquired hundreds of much smaller firms, many of whom have never \nsold any products, and who operate with quite different technologies and science \n22 \nbases e.g. biotech firms. More recently, GSK have embarked on a series of \ndivestments, and outsourced activities traditionally performed in-house.  \n So the original learning processes of R&D have been augmented by three \ndifferent phases of reconfiguration. The first phase of mega-mergers involved similar \nfirms combining, the second phase consisted of the acquisition of dissimilar firms \ne.g. much smaller businesses, with different technologies, and the most recent \nphase consisting of restructuring and outsourcing activities. Again, this is de facto \nevidence of regenerative dynamic capabilities triggered by performance problems \ncaused by the declining value of the existing resource base as products come off \npatent. The existing R&D dynamic capabilities were insufficient in and of themselves \nto maintain or indeed expand the stock of resources. The shift into biotech \nacquisitions was triggered by the realisation that the pipeline of new chemical entities \nwas drying up, with major pharmas restricted to the introduction of only one or two \nnew drugs per year. Generally, pharmaceutical companies are operating in a more \nchallenging environment due to high competitive rivalry, the price sensitivity of \nhealthcare providers and stricter ethical and efficacy standards.  \nSo we have evidence that dynamic capabilities in IGR and GSK have evolved \nover time, and we can infer that the processes which caused these adjustments and \naugmentations in capability fit our definition of regenerative dynamic capabilities. To \nrecap, regenerative dynamic capabilities do not directly create or reconfigure \nresources. They work indirectly by embedding new dynamic capabilities into the firm.  \nInterestingly, this could mean that these regenerative dynamic capabilities \nmay be more generic than dynamic capabilities, as dynamic capabilities operate \ndirectly on the resource base of the firm and thus need to be sensitive to the \nspecifics of the firm\u201fs context and its extant resource stock (Wang and Ahmed, \n23 \n2007). As already stated dynamic capabilities are embedded within the firm, are path \ndependent and hence most likely to be firm specific (Teece et al., 1997). While one \ncan argue that this view is not shared by Eisenhardt and Martin (2000), who state \nthat dynamic capabilities are equifinal, substitutable and fungible, we would suggest \nthat if dynamic capabilities are not sensitive and appropriately adapted to the current \nresource stock, the specific context, culture and history of the firm, they may not \nfacilitate in the creation of valuable resources, and there is even a risk that their \ninappropriate deployment may actually destroy subtle sources of advantage. \nRegenerative dynamic capabilities, changing the way a firm refreshes its resource \nbase, are one step removed from the resource stock itself and may therefore be \neffective across specific firm contexts.  \nFurther, as a firm has developed its dynamic capabilities over time through \nlearning processes (Zollo and Winter, 2002), which are reinforced and embedded \nthrough repetition (Nelson and Winter, 1982), it may be difficult for the incumbent \nmanagement to develop a new set of dynamic capabilities; breaking the \u201epath\u201f or \nculture within the firm may prove to be difficult. Indeed it is arguable that most \norganizational learning is often similar to what has been learnt before (Argyris and \nSchon, 1978) and managers may find it hard not to rely on existing dynamic \ncapabilities, to over-generalise from past experience or to rely on their existing \nmindset (Argote, 1999; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Managers may need to seek \nnew ways to operate, to break the old ways and refresh their dynamic capabilities \n(Zahra et al., 2006). These two arguments that regenerative dynamic capabilities \nmay be generic and may also be difficult to develop within the firm (Teece et al., \n1997), leads us to the issue of whether regenerative dynamic capabilities need to be \n24 \nembedded within the firm and if not can they qualify as belonging to the \u201erealm\u201f of \ndynamic capabilities?  \n \nRegenerative dynamic capabilities and embeddedness \nWhile it can be argued that regenerative dynamic capabilities, as any \ncapability, can be developed through time, we may want to address whether, when \nthere is simply no time for organizational learning and investment processes to take \nplace to develop and deploy them (Helfat et al., 2007; Zollo and Winter, 2002), these \nregenerative dynamic capabilities could not be sourced from outside the firm. If this \nwere the case then these regenerative dynamic capabilities would not be embedded \nwithin the firm. This raises the issue of whether imported regenerative dynamic \ncapabilities would qualify as a dynamic capability which \u201cmust contain some \npatterned element\u201d (Helfat et al., 2007, p. 5), i.e. that must be repeatable, it cannot \nbe a one-off incident of ad hoc problem solving (Helfat et al., 2007).  \nSo where might regenerative dynamic capabilities be imported from? In a \ncorporate, multi-strategic business unit (SBU) structure they could be located at the \ncorporate centre. Then, as and when regenerative dynamic capabilities are required \nwithin specific SBUs, the centre could appropriately deploy them to assist the SBU in \nregenerating its extant dynamic capabilities. These dynamic capabilities could also \ncome from outside the corporation altogether. For instance a new CEO could be \nbrought in, who has experience of transforming other firms, or strategic change \nconsultants could be deployed. While being new to the firm these capabilities, which \nwould impact on the firm\u201fs current set of dynamic capabilities, would have been \nexercised before by either the incoming leadership, the corporate centre or external \nconsultants, so for them this would be part of their normal role; this is their day job. \n25 \nThe new CEO, for instance, may have successful experience of identifying \nacquisition targets, successfully acquiring and integrating them. For this CEO what \nthey do within the firm is habitual, capabilities that they may have previously honed \nin different firms and contexts, and therefore these are not one-off performances. So \nfor the CEO this is nothing new, only the context is new, but for the firm this would \nconsist of a change in their dynamic capabilities, i.e. an instance of the exercise of \nregenerative dynamic capabilities.   \nSignificantly, even if imported from outside the firm we can argue that these \nregenerative dynamic capabilities fulfil the \u201erepeatability\u201f criteria, as they can be \nstable and routinised processes: Feldman and Pentland (2003) argue that an \norganizational routine can be decomposed into two components: the ostensive \naspect of the routine, that is the structure or abstract understanding of the routine, \nand the performative aspect, that is the actual performance of the routine, \u201cit is the \nroutine in practice\u201d (Feldman and Pentland, 2003, p.  101), it is what brings the \nroutine to life and hence the performance may be novel each time. Taking Feldman \nand Pentland\u201fs (2003) examples of a firm\u201fs recruitment process, a firm will recruit \nmany employees, so at an abstract level the activity of recruitment is routine and is \nrepeated; however how the hiring process is actually performed, the performative \naspect, may differ on each occasion. Those notions of ostensive and performative \naspects of the routine can also be related to Antonacopoulou\u201fs (2006) distinction \nbetween practice and practise. Practice relates to the ostensive aspect of the \nroutine, practise to the performative: \u201cthe same practice has always the potential to \nbe both performed and represented in diverse ways\u201d (Antonacopoulou, 2006, p. 16). \nWe can apply this to the regenerative dynamic capabilities construct and as a result \nargue that regenerative dynamic capabilities pass the repeatability test. While \n26 \nregenerative dynamic capabilities may look different in action (e.g. the strategy \nconsultant or hired CEO will apply their capabilities on a different set of dynamic \ncapabilities each time they move from firm to firm), its structure will likely remain the \nsame, and therefore it is repeatable as an ostensive routine.  \n \nDiscussion \nFinally, before concluding, we would like to comment on whether dynamic \ncapabilities are necessarily linked to positive impacts on firm performance. In our \npaper, similar to Helfat et al. (2007), we have decoupled the notion of dynamic \ncapabilities and performance and do not imply that dynamic capabilities \nautomatically lead to advantage. It is valuable, rare, difficult to imitate and non-\nsubstitutable resources that generate rents and contribute to the firm\u201fs super normal \nprofit by being involved either in delivering product advantages perceived by \ncustomers or by conferring process advantages that result in lower unit costs \n(Bowman and Ambrosini, 2003). In other words, the resource base is directly linked \nto rents, but dynamic capabilities are one step beyond (and regenerative dynamic \ncapabilities two steps beyond) these rent generating activities. Incremental and \nrenewing dynamic capabilities impact on the resource base, and regenerative \ndynamic capabilities in turn affect incremental and renewing dynamic capabilities.  \n The impact of dynamic capabilities on ultimate firm performance may be \nnegative, the dynamic capabilities may change the resource base but this renewal \nmay not be in line with the environment. This means following Zahra et al. (2006) \nthat while regenerative dynamic capabilities may allow a firm to change its dynamic \ncapabilities, it does not ensure that the organization will be successful or even \nsurvive.  \n27 \n An example of where using regenerative dynamic capabilities did not result in \nsuccess until the firm had experienced several failed attempts to adjust its dynamic \ncapabilities is Marks and Spencer (M&S). Historically M&S was highly successful, \nbut in the 1990s it suffered from decreasing profits and market share. M&S had \nmany problems. Notably it displayed both a lack of understanding of its customers \nand lack of reaction to their shifting needs, and it faced a significant challenge from a \nnumber of its competitors. This would suggest that the extant set of dynamic \ncapabilities which M&S used was no longer appropriate. To counter this, its board \nemployed a succession of new CEOs. The first three CEOs had similar ways of \nchanging M&S. Their changes resulted in leveraging the M&S brand, for example the \ncreation of its \u201eSimply Food\u201f range or the \u201e&More\u201f loyalty card. Despite these \nchanges of leadership the situation worsened.  \n The M&S board then hired Stuart Rose. In terms of explaining regenerative \ndynamic capabilities, here we see that in hiring yet another CEO the board are again \nrepeating their actions; this is the ostensive aspect of the regenerative dynamic \ncapability. The performative aspects of the regenerative dynamic capability are \nRose\u201fs actions. The regenerative dynamic capability level actions that Rose took \nwere essentially learning and replication. He had gathered knowledge and \nexperience from the previous positions he held at a series of high-street retailers (for \nexample, he had transformed the Arcadia group). He also had previously worked at \nM&S and had studied the decisions and resulting outcomes of the actions introduced \nby past CEOs. All this allowed Rose to create a new mix of dynamic capabilities. \nM&S stopped relying on only leverage to refresh its resource base. He changed the \nprocesses of buying, introduced new collaborative practices between M&S\u201f buyers \n28 \ntheir suppliers, and challenged many \u201esacred cows\u201f associated with the embedded \nincremental dynamic capabilities.  \nIt has been argued that success tends to lead to complacency, and that if \nmanagers perceive their firm to be successful, and believe it has been so for a while, \nthey are unlikely to change their ways of doing things or change their assumptions \n(Johnson, 1988; Smith et al., 2001; Zahra et al., 2006). This may suggest that \nregenerative dynamic capabilities are unlikely to be employed in such \ncircumstances, as managers may not be able to envisage how their current set of \ndynamic capabilities could or indeed why they should be changed. \u201cit clearly isn\u201ft \nbroke, so why fix it?\u201d (Tushman and Romanelli, 1985). Thus the deployment of \nregenerative dynamic capabilities will also depend on how often managers perceive \nthe need for this order of change, and this perception may be based on either \nexternal environmental characteristics, such as competitive rivalry, product life cycles \netc. or on personal characteristics, such as dissatisfaction towards the current level \nof performance or a personal propensity towards risk taking. This reinforces Teece et \nal.\u201fs (1997) framework of processes, position and paths, and Antonacopoulou\u201fs \n(2006) and Feldman\u201fs (2004) argument, that there is a constant connection between \nmicro and macro contexts. Dynamic capabilities are situated. They are situated in \nthe environment, the paths the firm has followed, what people within the firm have \ndone and are doing etc. These are all at play in the development of dynamic \ncapabilities, and history of the firm undoubtedly influences the presence and \nperformance of activities. \nFinally, we have argued that perceptions of the need for change can be \nformed from managerial awareness and understanding of the external environment, \nand from other internally located stimuli, including perceptions of performance and \n29 \npersonal motivations to effect change. Adopting such a perspective enables us to \naddress circumstances where the \u201eappropriate\u201f dynamic capabilities have not been \napplied i.e. where managers inappropriately diagnosed the type of change needed. \nFor instance, Johnson (1988) refers to \u201estrategic drift\u201f as a situation where \nmanagerial perceptions of the pace of change in the environment are out of line with \nthe actual external changes taking place, leading to insufficient internal adaptation \nand declining firm performance. Managers may perceive the need for radical \nchanges to the firm\u201fs operations, but acting on it may actually destroy resources. As \nsuch we suggest, along with others (e.g. Mezias and Starbuck, 2003), that managers \nmay inappropriately diagnose the degree of change required. For instance managers \nmay incorrectly identify stability in their environment. They may persist in applying \nimprovement routines, effectively screening out or re-interpreting any signals that \nmight suggest more radical changes might be required. Managers may prefer the \npredictability involved in repeating past behaviours, even where these may be \nembedding and creating core rigidities (Leonard-Barton 1992).  \nAs argued regenerative dynamic capabilities are likely to be applied where \nmanagers perceive substantial dynamism in their environments. These perceptions \nmay well be shaped by perceived discontinuities in the market environment, or by \nsignificant changes to the internal environment, but there may be a disconnect \nbetween the perceived environment and the actual environment, and we could \nenvisage managerial over- and under-reactions with respect to regenerative dynamic \ncapabilities. Over-reaction would occur where managers perceive the need for \nradical changes to the extant dynamic capabilities that are not actually warranted. \nThe effects are likely to be the destruction of parts of the resource base, and\/or a \nsignificant disturbance to extant change processes that would consume unnecessary \n30 \nresources and energy. Under-reaction would probably lead to slow or rapid decline \ndepending on the actual degree of turbulence in the external environment. \nIn summary we can propose that where managers underestimate \nenvironmental dynamism, there is a risk of strategic drift (Johnson, 1988), where the \nfirm fails to refresh its resource stock at an appropriate pace, or to the required \nextent. Alternatively, managers may look to change the resource base at a pace not \nwarranted by the actual degree of dynamism in the environment. This could have \npositive performance outcomes, if, as a consequence of these proactive changes, \nthe firm gains an advantage over competitors, and possibly re-defines the basis of \ncompeting. However, there is a possibility that excessive change would result in the \ndestruction of valuable resources, or indeed in the case of regenerative dynamic \ncapabilities, the destruction of valuable dynamic capabilities. \nWhatever the situation they perceive, for managers, knowing how to change \nand extend both their resource base and their dynamic capabilities is critical. Hence \nwe can argue that trying to better understand and develop the notion of dynamic \ncapabilities matters for both practitioners and academics alike. This leads us to \nargue that awareness of the three levels of dynamic capability should provoke \ndebate within top management teams. Specifically, managers could at least share \ntheir perceptions about the extent of environmental dynamism they perceive, and \nwhere there are differences in perception, this might encourage some important \nconversations, and maybe a search for further information to resolve some of these \ndifferences. Managers could also try to identify the nature of the extant dynamic \ncapabilities, and then determine whether these dynamic capabilities are appropriate \nto enable the firm to prosper in the perceived environmental context. Finally, should \n31 \nany adjustment in dynamic capabilities be required, managers could think how to \ndevelop them. \n \nConclusion \nBefore we conclude our paper we highlight a few areas for future research. As noted \nby many authors (see for example Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003) the challenge \nof any conceptual research is to develop empirical measures. We believe this is the \nnext logical step for the ideas set out in this paper. We propose that the three levels \nof dynamic capability could be researched empirically to find evidence to give them \ngreater depth and allow for more understanding of the concepts. It would be \ninteresting to study the use of regenerative dynamic capabilities for instance in \nyounger versus more established firms, whether managerial perceptions of \ndynamism varies across industries or if the use of different types of dynamic \ncapability varies across industries. In addition we also think there is value in \nconceptually developing the paper, for example by extending it further into the \nlearning or change literature, this should help build on our descriptions of the \nconstructs we have developed. \nIn closing, we have argued that there were three main levels of dynamic \ncapabilities, based on managerial perceptions. These three levels have allowed us to \nfurther open the \u201eblack box\u201f associated with comprehending dynamic capabilities. \nIf, as argued, firms must adapt to and exploit changes in their business \nenvironment and even to provoke change (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Helfat et al., \n2007) it is vital that we place managers at the centre of the discussion on dynamic \ncapabilities. We have done so by considering managerial perceptions of \nenvironmental dynamism, as managers base their decisions on their perceptions. \n32 \nAlso, with the notable exception of Eisenhardt and Martin (2000), the dynamic \ncapability construct has only been applied to a dynamic environment. By \ndistinguishing between incremental dynamic capabilities, which are used to \ncontinually improve the resource base, and renewing dynamic capabilities, which are \nused to adjust the mix of the extant resource stock, we have shown that the basic \nconcept of dynamic capability could be decomposed into two levels, according to \nperceptions of stability or dynamism in the environment. Then, following Winter\u201fs \n(2003) higher order argument and Helfat et al.\u201fs (2007) comment that some dynamic \ncapabilities can modify dynamic capabilities, we have proposed that firms may \nrequire a third level of dynamic capabilities: regenerative dynamic capabilities. Those \nare applied to regenerate the current set of dynamic capabilities and would be used \nwhen managers perceive a disruption to their environment that renders the current \nset of capabilities inappropriate. A firm needs regenerative dynamic capabilities if the \ndynamic capabilities it has in place are no longer relevant, or do not allow the firm to \n\u201cachieve new resource configurations as markets emerge, collide, split, evolve and \ndie\u201d (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000, p. 1107). \nWe have also explained that dynamic capabilities do not have to be \ndeveloped internally as asserted by Helfat et al. with Maritan (2007). They can be \nsourced from outside the firm. However using Feldman and Pentland\u201fs (2003) work \non ostensive and performative routines, we have shown that we have adhered to \nHelfat and Peteraf\u201fs (2003) requirement that dynamic capabilities must be repeatable \nand embedded. We have also explained and discussed that managerial perceptions \nof their internal and external environment were central to the development and \ndeployment of all types of dynamic capabilities and that it was plausible that these \nperceptions may be sometimes inaccurate and consequently dynamic capabilities \n33 \nmay be applied inappropriately. Therefore the performance of dynamic capabilities \nwould not in itself lead to performance improvements; these improvements would \noccur only where there was a matching of perceived dynamism and the \u201ereal\u201f degree \nof dynamism, and only where the firm actually had the required order of dynamic \ncapability, would we expect a positive performance outcome. \nFinally, Zahra et al. (2006, p. 917) report that \u201cthe emergent literature on \ndynamic capabilities and their role in value creation is riddled with inconsistencies, \noverlapping definitions, and outright contradictions. Yet, the theoretical and practical \nimportance of developing and applying dynamic capabilities to sustain a firm\u201fs \ncompetitive advantage in complex and volatile external environments has catapulted \nthis issue to the forefront of the research agendas of many scholars\u201d. We hope this \npaper brings us a step closer to clarifying definitions of dynamic capabilities. \n34 \nReferences \nAdner, R. and C.
