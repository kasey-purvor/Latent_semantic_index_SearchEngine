This paper concerns itself with an \noverview of this concept of the \u2018big Other\u2019 particularly in reference to \nhow it may benefit critical social psychological analyses. The \nexplanatory value of this notion is introduced via a series of Lacanian \nparadoxes (the Other as vanishing-point of inter-subjectivity that \ncannot itself be subjectivized; the Other as simultaneously \u201cinside\u201d and \n\u201coutside\u201d; the Other as both embodiment of the social substance and \nyet also the site of the unconscious). I then move on to show how this \nnotion opens conceptual opportunities for social psychological \nconceptualizations of the formation of the social. I close by \ndemonstrating what the \u2018big Other\u2019 offers critical social psychological \nanalyses of power. \n \nKeywords: Lacan, \u2018big Other\u2019, Master-Signifier, critical psychology, identification, \nsubjectivity, inter-subjectivity, power. \n \nLacanian theory and social psychology: A non-relation?  \nSpeaking in 1987 on the issue of the social dimension of the psychological, \nJacques Alain-Miller - Lacan\u2019s heir-apparent \u2013 placed particular emphasis on the \nFreudian distinction between the \u2018i\u2019 of the ideal-ego and the \u2018I\u2019 of the ego-ideal. In \nLacanian theory this is the differentiation between imaginary identification (\u2018what \nwe would like to be\u2019) and symbolic identification (identification from where we \nlook at ourselves) (\u017di\u017eek, 1989). On the level of the \u2018I\u2019, notes Miller  \nyou can without difficulties introduce the social. The I of the ideal can \nbe in a superior and legitimate way constructed as a social and \nideological function\u2026 [Lacan] did this in his \u00c9crits: he situates a \ncertain politics in the very foundations of psychology, so that the thesis \nthat all psychology is social can be treated as Lacanian (p. 21, added \nemphasis). \nMiller\u2019s comments open up a number of interesting possibilities, that concepts \nderived from Lacanian psychoanalysis may be valuable adjuncts to critical and \nsocial psychological analyses, firstly, and, furthermore, that Lacanian thought \nmay even be enough to rejuvenate the largely defunct domain of psychoanalytic \nsocial psychology. Two curiosities emerge in respect of such an agenda. The first \nconcerns the fact that to speak of psychoanalytic social psychology today is \nalmost necessarily to speak historically. Beyond attempts to append \npsychoanalytic concepts to the frame of discursive psychology (Billig, 1997, \n1998, 1999; Gough, 2004; Parker, 1997; Riggs, 2005, Wetherell, 2003) and \nexcluding for the moment efforts at linking psychoanalytic notions to types of \n 1\ninterview methodology (Frosh, Phoenix & Pattman, 2000, 2003; Hollway & \nJefferson, 2000, 2005), there is little that one might refer to as a contemporary \ntradition of psychoanalytic social psychology, even less so one willing to keep up \nto speed with more recent innovations in psychoanalytic theory (although, \nadmittedly, the contributions of Frosh (2002) and Parker (2001, 2003) make for \nsomething of an exception).  \nThe second oddity concerns the degree to which critical social psychology \nhas shied away from Lacanian theory in particular (again there are exceptions, \nsee Frosh & Baraitser, 2003; Parker, 2005; Georgaca, 2005) \u2013 the body of \nthought which represents perhaps the most vital re-invigorating current within \npsychoanalysis today. One is even tempted in this respect to view Billig\u2019s (2006) \nangry rejection of Lacan\u2019s \u201cmisuse of psychology\u201d as symptomatic of Social \nPsychology\u2019s general response to Lacanian theory. This lack of engagement is \nstriking inasmuch as Lacanian theory offers important insights into many of what \nwe might consider the constituting problematics of social psychology, whether we \nhave in mind the dilemmas of racism (Fanon, 1952; Seshadri-Crooks, 2000; \n\u017di\u017eek, 1994b, 1997) and ideology (Glynos, 2001; Laclau, 1996; Stavrakakis, \n1997, 1999, 2007; \u017di\u017eek, 1989, 1994a), the quandaries of \u201cgendered\u201d subjectivity \n(Frosh, 2002; Mitchell & Rose, 1982; Salecl, 2000; Verhaeghe, 2001, 2002; \nWright, 2000), the broader issues of social identification and the relation to a \n\u201cgeneralized Other\u201d (Fink, 1995, 1997; Salecl, 1994a, 2004; \u017di\u017eek, 1992a, 1992b, \n2001) or the nature and functioning of discourse (Bracher et al., 1994).  \nWithout launching into a lengthy digression on the above themes and their \ncorresponding Lacanian insights, it might suffice to provide just two exemplars of \nthe usefulness of key Lacanian motifs in social psychological analysis. The \nnotion of jouissance (excessive libidinal enjoyment) has provided an enabling \nperspective on the libidinal economy of racism, and indeed, on the issue \u2013 often \navoided by discursive accounts \u2013 of the responsibility for the \u2018enjoyment\u2019 of racist \nutterances (Salecl, 1998; \u017di\u017eek, 1994, 2005). Likewise, the fact of the \nparadoxical and often \u2018external\u2019 character of belief as articulated by Lacan \n(1992), usefully extended by \u017di\u017eek\u2019s (1989, 2006) notion of inter-passivity - I \nmyself need not believe for there to be a believing of which I am part \u2013 extends \nour grasp on the prevalence and power of ideology in ostensibly non-ideological \ntimes (Pfaller, 2005; Porter, 2006; Sharpe, 2004). \nSocial Psychology\u2019s avoidance of these and other related concepts is \nnotable given that many Lacanian notions - jouissance, the triad of the \nimaginary\/symbolic\/real, objet petit a, the big Other, etc. \u2013 have by now assumed \na certain currency with the broader field of social and political theory (Badiou, \n2001, 2005; Butler, 1993, 1997; Butler, Laclau & \u017di\u017eek, 2000; Critchley, 2007; \nLaclau, 1996; Laclau & Mouffe, 1985). This lack of recourse is more conspicuous \nyet in view of the newly emerging body of literature at the interface of popular \nculture and Lacanian psychoanalysis (Dolar, 1999, 2006; Leader, 1996, 2002; \nSalecl 1994a, 2004; Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, 1992a, 1992b; to name just a few) which has \ndone much to establish a middle-ground between Lacanian theory as abstruse \napparatus of clinical and philosophical reflection and a more accessible social \nand cultural grounds of application. My aim here is not to address this lack of \n 2\nengagement in any further detail; my intention is rather to flag up this issue, to \nleave it as hanging question, deserving future attention. I prefer here to adopt a \nmore constructive tack, to look outside of critical social psychology to promising \ndevelopments outside of the field (i.e. within Lacanian theory), concerning myself \nthus with the demonstrative exercise of showing the usefulness of one particular \nLacanian concept to critical social psychology, namely that of the \u2018big Other\u2019.  \nAlthough or engagement with the notion of the big Other will necessarily \nbe incomplete \u2013 Evans (1996) speaks of the \u2018other\u2019 as \u201cperhaps the most \ncomplex term in Lacan\u2019s work\u201d (p. 132) \u2013 I will nevertheless aim to demonstrate \nsomething of the term\u2019s explanatory and analytical efficacy. Not only is this a \nconcept that sheds light on the ever-vexing question of the subject-to-society \nrelation, it is also one that brings with it a series of lessons about the \nspontaneous emergence of certain forms of power and social identification. A \nseries of interlinked questions will thus be important in what follows, the first of \nwhich opens conceptual opportunities for social psychological understandings of \nthe formation of the social, the second of which concerns more directly critical \nsocial psychological understandings of the mechanisms of power, authority and \nrole-induction. Firstly then: how are we as individual subjects linked into the \nsocial? How is such an operation managed, moreover, in such a way that \nconsolidates a disparate field of individuals into a coherent society and that thus \nattains the social objectivity of \u201cthe way things are done\u201d in a given culture or \ncommunity? Secondly, how do the relations thus established give rise to \napparently inevitable effects of power and truth; how is it that such relations \nnecessarily instantiate a locus of authority and knowledge?  \nOne last remark is necessary before we turn to addressing these \nquestions. Clearly my attempt here - along with the broader tentative project of a \n\u2018Lacanian psychoanalytic social psychology\u2019 - requires the mediation of a series \nof reasons why Lacanian psychoanalysis is not simply a mode of psychology. \nCertain such points of incompatibility will in fact become apparent as we \ncontinue; to stress the obvious: these are differences that should not be under-\nestimated. All I wish to note here is that such a task of qualification need not \nimperil the project of outlining a Lacanian social psychology provided that in \ndoing so we are prepared to radically reconsider the parameters of the \u2018social \npsychological\u2019. \n \nParadoxes of the Other \n \nThe vanishing point of inter-subjectivity \n \nThere are a series of paradoxes underlining the notion of the big Other that need \nbe attended to if we are to introduce the concept in a way from which social \npsychology might benefit. The first of these concerns the fact that the big Other \nexists at a step removed from the dialectics of inter-subjectivity despite that it \ngrounds the coherence of any such interchange. One might accentuate this \napparent paradox by insisting on two important facets of the Lacanian notion: the \nOther is always somehow enigmatic, it escapes encapsulation, it is always an \n 3\nabsolute Other, conditioned by a fundamental alterity, despite that it remains the \nvery stuff - the social substance \u2013 of my attempts at comprehension. \nIn accounting for this paradox we need refer to an elementary distinction, \nfirst voiced by Lacan in his Seminar II between the Other and others. In respect \nof the latter, one refers to other subjects, people with whom I might identify with, \nor enter into aggressive rivalries and conflicts with; these are \u2018little\u2019 others with \nwhom inter-subjective relations are possible. The Other, by contrast, stands \nbeyond the realm of imaginary identifications; it exists outside of the frame of \nsuch games of mirrored wholeness and antagonism. I do not, indeed mistake \n\u2018Other for I\u2019 and \u2018I for Other\u2019. Freud (1921) provides a nice example of this in \nGroup Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego: when a solider adopts habits of \nhis peers this makes him one of the group; if on the other hand he attempts to \nadopt the mannerisms of his General, he becomes ridiculous. Incidentally, this \nexample nicely replicates the distinction introduced at the very beginning of the \npaper, between the \u2018i\u2019 of the ideal-ego (imaginary identifications with like others \u2013 \ni.e. fellow soldiers) and the \u2018I\u2019 of the ego-ideal (symbolic identifications that gain \ntheir orientation from the place from which we look at ourselves). \nPut bluntly then, there is no psychological domestication of the Other, it \nremains always radically exterior, beyond the horizon of any conceivable inter-\nsubjectivity. It cannot, in and of itself, be subjectivized, given a localized \npsychology. Importantly however, as Lacan points out in Seminar VIII, another \nsubject may occupy this position, and may thus \u2018embody\u2019 the Other \u2013 albeit in an \nimpermanent or contingent manner - for another subject (as is the case of the \nGeneral in the Freud example). We might say then that the Other is the \nvanishing-point which provides the co-ordinates for inter-subjectivity despite that \nit itself cannot be \u2018subjectivized\u2019. \n \nThe \u2018rules of the game\u2019 \n \nThe \u2018beyondness\u2019 of the Other is best grasped in connection with a second \ncrucial component of the concept, the notion of the Other as the entirety of the \nsymbolic domain, that is, as not only the rituals and institutions around which our \nsociety is organized, \u201cbut the very language which marks the subject as a \nspeaking being\u201d (Salecl, 1998, p. 21). This is the Other both as \u201cthe collection of \nall the words and expressions in a language\u201d (Fink, 1995, p. 5), and the Other as \nsocial substance, as the amassed roles, traditions, understandings and unwritten \nobligations that define a given societal situation, the Other, in other words, as the \n\u2018rules that govern the game\u2019. The Other here is an alienating system, an always \nalready existing totality to which the subject needs accommodate themselves; it \nis the \u201ctreasury of signifiers\u201d with which there can be no automatic or harmonious \nfit. As is by no doubt apparent, our distance from everyday conceptions of \npsychological subjectivity is here pronounced. We have been confronted with a \nkind of supra-agency \u2013 be it that of language, the entire accumulated mass of \n\u2018the social\u2019 \u2013 which speaks through, or over, which appears to determine the \nsubject. In the tussle between psychological subjectivity and the role of \n 4\ndetermining structure, the Lacanian notion of the Other, so it would seem, is on \nthe side of structure.  \nA daunting question arises at this point \u2013 a second paradox \u2013 namely that \nof how the Other emerges. We confront here, as \u017di\u017eek (1996) stresses, the \napparent deadlock between methodological individualism (the explanatory \nprimacy of individuals and their interactions) and the Durkheimian notion of \nSociety as \u2018always already there\u2019, the notion of society as the substantial order \nthat serves as the spiritual foundation of individual being. Or, framed slightly \ndifferently, if it is the case, as Evans (1996) asserts, that \u201cthe Other is the \nsymbolic insofar as it is particularized for each subject\u201d (p. 133), then how is the \nOther is also the embodiment of social substance, that which amounts to more \nthan the sum total of a society\u2019s individuals? Or, to echo one of our opening \nquestions: how is it then that \u2018the social\u2019 comes to constitute a type of objectivity \n(of accepted background norms, mores and values, a \u2018rules of the game\u2019) that \nexceeds a mere aggregation of individuals?  \n \nI don\u2019t know what I am going to say \n \n\u201cThe \u2018big Other\u2019\u201d says \u017di\u017eek, is the name for social substance, it is that on \naccount of which the subject never fully dominates the effects  of their acts, \u201con \naccount of which the final outcome of his or her activity is always something \nother than what was intended or anticipated\u201d (2005, p. 332). Given this reference \nto extra-intentional acts and effects, along with the above reference to the supra-\nagency of the Other, it is not hard to anticipate the more overtly psychoanalytic \u2013 \nand clinical \u2013 application of this idea of the Other as the treasury of signifiers. \nIndeed, the Structuralist echoes of the above quote need be taken in conjunction \nwith the associated notion that the unconscious can be regarded \u2013 as in Lacan\u2019s \nfamous assertion \u2013 as \u201cthe discourse of the Other\u201d (Lacan, 1977). The Other \nhere is tantamount to another locality, an \u2018other place\u2019, a term in which Freud\u2019s \ndescription of the \u2018other scene\u2019 of dreams shines through.  \nLacan\u2019s assertion in \u00c9crits is that the origin of speech cannot be fixed in \nthe subject \u2013 for the effects of subject are taken always to exceed the controls of \nthe ego \u2013 and should instead be located in the Other (1977, p. 16). Lacan\u2019s claim \nimplies the importance of a focus on the dimension of speech itself, and draws \nattention to the role of the Other as a kind of \u2018hovering interlocutor\u2019 that \naccompanies each instance of speaking. Here then a third paradox: how is the \nOther both \u201cthe discourse of the unconscious\u201d and the \u2018rules of the game\u2019, the \n\u2018treasury of signifiers\u2019 of the entire symbolic order?  \nIt is useful in this respect to revisit a rudimentary psychoanalytic postulate \nconcerning the truthfulness of bungled speech. The uncertainty, the unreliability \nof the spoken word, nicely emphasized in Verhaeghe\u2019s (2001) reminder \u201cwhen I \nspeak, I do not know what I am going to say\u201d (p. 22), is here of crucial \nimportance. What comes with the use of language, the cost, as it were, of \nattempts at expression within this foreign system, is that more than one line of \nmeaning can be traced through what I have just said. The speech we produce is \nalways thus shadowed by an Other sensibility. In other words, speaking is never \n 5\nmerely a function of ego discourse; it remains always the enunciative possibility \nfor an Other tongue, for the Lacanian unconscious which precisely is the \nprocesses of signification beyond the control of the speaking subject. With these \npoints of concern \u2013 the extra-intentional, the unconscious, the seemingly external \nlocus of speech \u2013 we can once again mark our distance from the mainstream of \nsocial psychological analysis. \n \nFrom where I am heard \n \nThe Other, notes Leader (2000), is not only the set of elements that make up the \nsymbolic world the subject is born into, it also the symbolic place which is present \neach time that someone speaks. The puzzle that emerges here \u2013 to reiterate the \nparadox just offered - is that we have two apparent directions or locations. We \nhave the Other apparently \u201cinside\u201d us, as the foreign language \u2013 or \u201cmOther \ntongue\u201d to use Fink\u2019s (1995) helpful phrase \u2013 that we rely upon in our attempts at \nexpression. Then there is the \u201coutside\u201d Other, the Other as the set of \ncommunicative rules and symbolic codes which forms the grounds and basis of \nall attempts at meaning-making. This, we might say, is the Other as a locus of \nlistening: \nThe Other is a place from which you are heard, from which you are \nrecognized. The Other is thus the place of language, external to the \nspeaker, and yet, since he or she is a speaker, internal at the same \ntime (Leader, 1995, p. 60).  \nIt is perhaps easier to grasp this apparent double-nature of the Other (the Other \nas both \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d; as both \u2018discourse of the unconscious\u2019 and the \nsocial substance) by drawing attention to how each act of speaking presupposes \na point of reception, a place of intelligibility from which one might be understood. \nThis is one of the points Lacan (1977) makes about the functioning of speech in \n\u00c9crits: each instance of speech implies an interlocutor, even (we might add) if \nthis interlocutor is little more than a hypothetical postulate.  \nWhy is it, we might ask, that we use socially-intelligible terms to express \nourselves \u2013 when I swear to express frustration, say \u2013 even when we are totally \nalone? The Lacanian answer: as speaking subjects we never step outside of the \nsocial field. Every time we are involved in the making of meaning \u2013 even if only to \nourselves \u2013 we do so in view of a context of potential recognition (i.e. of \u2018how one \nis heard\u2019). Such a place of recognition \u2013 never within the confines of our control \u2013 \nnecessarily plays a crucial role in determining the meaning of our utterances, in \nhow they are taken up, how they resonate.  \n \nThe frame of social intelligibility \n \nWhat is being insisted upon here - again a seemingly \u201cextra-psychological\u201d \nperspective \u2013 is the radical contingency, the externality of even our most private \nexpressions. We have a sense thus of how meaning might be said to come from \nthe Other, and an awareness also of how the apparent \u201cinside\u201d\/\u201doutside\u201d \ndistinction posed above collapses. Any act of signification is only intelligible, only \n 6\nindeed possible against a background framework of rules and presuppositions \nthat, as it were, co-determines my meaning. This is also how to understand the \noverlap of the Other as symbolic order and the unconscious as \u201cdiscourse of the \nOther\u201d. We are concerned once again with the impossibility of ever fully \ncontrolling the implications of one\u2019s speech within the social field: this \nimpossibility \u2013 in contrast to the presumptions of a depth psychology - is the \nprecondition for effects of the unconscious. To be doubly sure: the eternal \ndisparity between what speakers intend to say and the enunciative dimension of \nhow this is actually performed and\/or heard against the backdrop of the \u2018treasury \nof signifiers\u2019 is an absolute condition of possibility for the emergence of the \nLacanian unconscious. The Other as language, as frame of social and \ncommunicative intelligibility is thus coterminous with the eruption within everyday \nspeech of unconscious discourse. \nSalecl adds a useful gloss to these issues which works to summarize much \nof the foregoing discussion. The Other, she says, is the symbolic structure in \nwhich the subject has always been embedded. It is not a positive social fact: \nit is quasi-transcendental, and forms the frame structuring our \nperception of reality; its status is normative, it is a world of symbolic \nrules and codes. As such, it also does not belong to the psychic level: \nit is a radically external, non-psychological universe of symbolic codes \nregulating our psychic self-experience. It is a mistake either to \ninternalize the big Other and reduce it to a psychological fact, or to \nexternalize the big Other and reduce it to institutions in social reality \n(Salecl, 1998, p. 17). \nElsewhere she (1994b) applies the notion of the Other to account for the \nideological force of education, an ideological force, she convincingly argues, that \ncannot be reduced either to the result of institutional structure (as in Marxist \naccounts), nor simply to the psychological pragmatics of inter-subjective speech \n(as in speech-act theory). Perhaps one of the most crucial facets of this notion \u2013 \nvital to grasp if we are to profit from its analytical value \u2013 is that the Other, the \n\u2018third in any dialogue\u2019, is explained neither by sole reference to structure nor by \nexclusive explanations of psychological subjectivity. It arises indivisibly between \nstructure and psyche, as the mediator between the societal and the individual \nwhich inevitably conditions each such interchange without becoming a sub-\ncategory of either side. \nIn this introductory section I have obviously not been able to address all \nthe issues arising from the paradoxes highlighted above. Then again, variants on \nthese themes - particularly the deadlock of methodological individualism versus \nsocial primacy, the facet of the Other as indivisible mediator \u2013 will feature in what \nwe now wish to discuss, namely the subject of the Other as it features in the \nrealization of power. \n \nAppealing to the symbolic \n \nIn two of Freud\u2019s most famous cases he is confronted with a similar \nepistemological quandary, that in which the predominance of a certain schema - \n 7\nthe fear of a castrating father for the Wolf Man, the emergence of the Oedipus \ncomplex for Little Hans \u2013 seems completely disproportionate to the empirical \ndetails of the case. In neither case do the \u2018actual facts\u2019 - the nanny\u2019s castration \nthreat to the Wolf Man, or the pathetic, subservient father of little Hans - seem up \nto the task of generating the formidable complexes that do eventually emerge. \nWe have thus a disconcerting mismatch between empirical phenomena and \nstructure. In Freud\u2019s terms: \u201cWe are often able to see the schema triumphing \nover the experience of the individual\u201d, as in the Wolf Man case where \u201cthe boy\u2019s \nfather became the castrator and menace of his infantile sexuality in spite of what \nwas\u2026an inverted Oedipus complex\u201d (1918, p. 119). \nThis is not simply, as some might have it, a case of Freud\u2019s insistence on \nthe ascendance of his own theoretical model over and above the empirical \ndetails of the case. A more important point is being made about the spontaneous \nemergence of certain regular schemata, certain structures of response which far \nexceed their apparent factual grounds of possibility. Freud\u2019s response to this \ndilemma - one that no doubt strikes us today as inadequate - is via recourse \n\u201cphylogenetically inherited schemata\u201d which he says, \u201clike the categories of \nphilosophy, are concerned with the business of \u2018placing\u2019 the impressions derived \nfrom actual experience\u201d (p. 119).  As Leader (2003, 2007) has pointed out, a \nstructural, indeed, Lacanian re-reading of this paragraph would draw attention to \nthe change of registers implied by the recourse to phylogenetic history. There is \nthus something enabling in the Freudian idea that when the child confronts a \ncertain deadlock - a \u2018real\u2019 experience that is impossible for them to make sense \nof - they make an appeal to symbolic prehistory (Leader, 2007). The importance \nof such an appeal to the Symbolic in the face of deadlocks of experience is that it \ngoes some way to explaining how subjects are able to manifest perfectly \nworkable (Oedipal, castration) complexes \u2013 \u201cinherited schemata\u201d \u2013 even in the \nabsence of obviously supporting empirical circumstances. This, the fact of the \napparently spontaneous emergence of certain structures of power \u2013 that is, the \nabrupt manifestation of certain Others of authority and the assumption of \nparticular roles of subservience relative to such Others \u2013 will prove crucial in \nwhat follows. \n \nWhat is the source of power? \n \nIn an important paper \u2018Where does power come from?\u2019 Mladen Dolar (1999) \ntraces a series of parallels and disparities between Lacanian and Foucauldian \nconceptions of power. He begins by isolating the similarity between two signature \nslogans: Foucault\u2019s \u2018Power doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 (in any substantive or structural manner \nthat is) and Lacan\u2019s \u2018The Other lacks\u2019 (Dolar, p. 79). What then is the crucial \ndifference between these two approaches? \nFor psychoanalysis \u2013 despite the later Lacan\u2019s insistence on the fictional \nstatus of the symbolic (the notion that \u2018the big Other doesn\u2019t exist\u2019) \u2013 the Other is \nalways already there. It is an automatic point of appeal; it emerges by virtue of \nthe subject\u2019s negotiation with structure, as an effect of their involvement in \nlanguage. This hypothetical \u201cfigure supposed to know\u201d functions as the \n 8\nembodiment of authority and knowledge - it is, as Stavrakakis (1999) nicely puts \nit, the order of a Master and guarantor \u2013 and it emerges even in the absence of \novert asymmetries of power. For psychoanalysis, claims Dolar, it is this Other \nthan can account for the mechanisms of power. For Foucault, by contrast, we \ncannot assume any such Other as a starting point for analysis, or as an \nexplanatory device; any such effects of the Other must themselves be explained, \nlinked into a genealogical trajectory of forces and events. This may give us \nreason to pause: surely, we might ask, Foucault here is right; we must be able to \naccount for the Other in the terms of a series of interlinked effects and \nstrategies? It cannot, after all, be seen as a transcendental factor, as an \nautomatic dimension of human existence?  \nTurning for the moment back to psychoanalysis, we might ask: when does \nthe Other arise for the subject? What are the minimal conditions of emergence \nfor that which is said to \u2018always already\u2019 exist? Dolar\u2019s response is \nstraightforward: the Other arises the moment the subject is confronted with the \nsymbolic structure. This is what Lacanian theory directs us to, an appreciation \nthat any symbolic structure or social milieu has the effect - at least if we are to \nsuccessfully participate, communicate within its means - of installing such a point \nof authority and appeal. As in the Wolf Man and Little Hans cases, such an \nappeal is often driven by the imperative of needing to place or make symbolic \nsense of \u2018real\u2019 experiences that cannot otherwise be comprehended (Leader, \n2007). The supposition of such a locus of authority and knowledge provides a \ncrucial means of grasping how we are linked into the symbolic realm, perhaps \nprecisely so at those points when it seems compromised, threatened with \ncollapse. It is vital in this respect to emphasize the unavoidability of the Other, its \nstructural inescapability.  \nThe Other, to reiterate, is necessarily posited by each instance of social \ninteraction; it is the point of intelligibility which makes the system of inter-\nsubjectivity work. The big Other, as Dolar (1999) notes, is \nthe hypothetical authority that upholds the structure and the supposed \naddress of any act of speech, beyond interlocution or intersubjectivity, \nthe third in any dialogue (p. 87). \nOne of the prospective benefits of such an approach is that it understands the \nseemingly spontaneous emergence of such effects of structure on subjectivity. \nFoucault\u2019s error then, we might conclude, is to make what appears an intuitive \ndemand: asking after the preconditions, the chain of material causes and \nsituational variables behind any \u2018Other-effects\u2019. In so doing, he misses something \nof the Other as an immediate eventuality of the subject\u2019s engagement with \nstructure. That is, he fails to grasp the Other as an always already present \nprinciple of authority, and thus misses something crucial about the automatic \ninstantiation of power. \n \nl\u2019 Autre n\u2019existe pas \n \nThere is a crucial paradox to be added to those discussed above: despite that it \nfunctions as a crucial anchoring-point, a locus of authority and knowledge, \n 9\ndespite its very inevitability, the Other is lacking, not whole. This is something \nthat is easy to overlook once we have grasped the importance of the Other as \n\u2018the third in every dialogue\u2019, as the background, the \u2018objective spirit\u2019 to use \nHegel\u2019s term dictating \u2018the way things are done\u2019, the implicit already accepted \nstandards of value and belief within a given society. We must though remain \nattentive to the frequent qualifications in Lacanian theory: the Other \u2013 along with \nall the knowledge and\/or authority it is supposed to embody \u2013 never moves \nbeyond the status of presupposition, hypothesis. It is never fully confirmed, \ndefinitely established - except in fantasy-formations, such as that of the ideal, \nharmonious society, the soul-mate partner that fully completes me \u2013 but always \nretains doubt, indefiniteness, virtuality as defining features. One can never be \nabsolutely sure about the Other. It is always, in part, a transferential relation. \nThis lack, or indeed, non-existence of the Other (as in Lacan\u2019s l\u2019 Autre \nn\u2019existe pas) \u2013 something that every successful analysis is said to reveal - does \nnot mean that Other ceases to function as an operative principle of social and \ncommunicative coherence. This is precisely the paradox: the Other is at the \nsame time lacking, a domain of presumption and fiction, and yet it nonetheless \nremains the anchoring-point that a given society relies upon to maintain its \ncoherence. There is no necessary contradiction here: it is quite possible that we \ncontinue to act as if the Other exists, even if in a rational or cynical frame of mind \nwe claim not to believe in any such over-riding principle of authority. This, \nincidentally, is why the intellectual insight of the Other\u2019s insubstantiality \u2013 that \nthere is ultimately no final, absolute truth, no single authority of being \u2013 remains \nan inadequate level of realization for psychoanalysis. \n\u017di\u017eek (1989, 2001) is in his element when discussing such vicissitudes of \nbelief. It is enough, he notes, that we think others believe (or that they did once \nbelieve) to instantiate an Other; we need not consciously subscribe to a particular \nversion of the Other (God, Nation, the Cause, Justice, etc.) for our activities to \nadhere to, and indeed, confirm such a locus of authority and truth. A Lacanian, \nhe says, does not simply dismiss the Other; \u201che counts on the efficiency of the \nbig Other, yet he does not trust it, since he knows he is dealing with an order of \nsemblance\u201d (1994b, p. 209). It is worth pausing to note here that all the examples \nprovided above (God, Nation, the ideological Cause, Justice) are potent signifiers \n\u2013 they represent ideals that many are willing to live and die for \u2013 that as such \nbear the weight of considerable investment and fervour. How then do we account \nfor this overlap of emptiness and undecidability with the operation of a primary \nsignifier, this extraordinary co-incidence of that which is hypothetical, even \nfictional, with that which, potentially, means everything? \n \nImbalance in the system \n \nIn a critique of Derrida, \u017di\u017eek (1994b) warns that one cannot reduce the Lacanian \nsymbolic \u201cto the balanced economy of exchange\u201d (p. 195). The reason for this is \nthat such a system inevitably yields one or more privileged signifiers; not all \nsignifiers, we might say, are equal in such an economy. Linking this to our \nimmediate concerns: Lacan\u2019s concept of the Other moves beyond the classic \n 10\nStructuralist conception of a differential system of components, to an \nappreciation of the fact that certain key ideas \u2013 the motifs of a given ideology, for \ninstance - attain a disproportionate hold upon us. Returning to Dolar (1999): \nAny notion of structure, far from being simply differential, a balanced \nmatrix of permutations, necessarily gives rise to a \u2018Master Signifier\u2019, a \nstructural function that power gets hold of, but which is in itself empty, \ndevoid of meaning, a pure positivization of a void (p. 87). \nTo put this in more straightforward terms: any symbolic or social system will yield \ncertain prioritized values and notions. These are the anchoring-points, the \napparent fixities \u2013 the exceptional signifiers - around which a great many other \nsignifiers coalesce and come to gain meaning, a semblance of fixity. Ultimately \nthere is no natural primacy to these markers \u2013 they remain forever hollow, \ninsubstantial, empty. That however is less important than the fact that the social \nor symbolic system in question needs an unquestioned assumption as a centring \npoint, their navigational principle - their \u2018magnetic north\u2019- in terms of which all \nsurrounding signifiers gain a sense, a location, an identity. \nSuch Master Signifiers are not easily contested, refuted, or denied \u2013 \nhence the idea that not all signifiers in a given field are equal - because they play \nsuch an important role in fixing meanings, in providing co-ordinates for \nsurrounding signifiers. What is of utmost importance in this respect is that these \nMaster Signifiers emerge precisely at those points where meaning can never be \nfully determined. It is not then simply a coincidence that undecidability and \nprimary signification occur at one and the same place; what we are dealing with \nhere is precisely \u2018the positivization of a void\u2019 in Dolar\u2019s phrase. \nGlynos (2001), in a summary of the Lacanian position, makes essentially \nthe same point.. Society, he says, lacks an ultimate signifier with which to make it \ncomplete: \n[N]othing positive can be said about the \u2018truth\u2019 of society except that it \nis incomplete \u2013 in Lacanian terms, that there is a \u2018lack in the symbolic \nOther\u2019. Thus, society exists as a totality only insofar as the social \nsubject posits its existence as such through the mediation of empty \nsignifiers (2001, p. 197). \n \nFrom lack to that which means everything \n \nLet us take an everyday example: if one is to interrogate one\u2019s own deepest \nvalues, and to press on with question after question as to \u2018why?\u2019, as to what lies \nbehind, what justifies the single most important belief we claim to have \u2013 whether \nit is a spiritual, an emotional, a political commitment \u2013 this chain of values will \nultimately lead to an empty \u2018because I do\u2019, \u2018because it is\u2019. Being in love provides \nanother example; the reason why I love this person is never fully rationalized by \nthe string of signifiers which follow on from this fact; being in love is itself a self-\njustifying fact which always exceeds the \u2018reasons why I love them\u2019. \nWhat Lacanian theory is attentive to is the moment in which such a lack - \nthe inability to articulate a final justification, a definitive substance - switches over \ninto something quite different, into that which (potentially) lies behind the \n 11\nmeaning of everything, that which grounds me, providing a coherent social role \nand significance for my existence. A failure, in short \u2013 an inability to explain \u2013 is \nthus translated into the positive condition of our existence as types of meaningful \nsocial subjects. As Glynos (2001) puts it: epistemological incapacity is hence \ntransformed into the positive ontological condition of society and of our social \nsubjectivity. It is this that the Other is a beneficiary of: the conversion, as \u017di\u017eek \nputs it, of undecidability with regard to its forever unsure signified into an \nexceptional signifier, the empty Master Signifier: \n\u2018Nation\u2019, \u2018Democracy\u2019, \u2018Socialism\u2019 and other causes stand for \n\u2018something\u2019 about which we are never sure what exactly, it is \u2013 the \npoint is, rather, that by identifying with Nation we signal our \nacceptance of what others accept, with a Master signifier which serves \nas the rallying point for all the others (\u017di\u017eek, 1996, p. 142). \n \nMeaning-to-come \n \nWe appreciate something then about the virtuality of the Other \u2013 the Other as \nhypothesis, as \u201cthe subject supposed to know\u201d \u2013 whom, like the analyst, remains \nalways in part the result of a transferential relation (i.e. what we presume of \nthem). More than this, we understand how this virtuality of the Other enables it to \nact as a Master Signifier which is thus able \u2013 because of, not in spite of its \nindefiniteness \u2013 to consolidate the social field. The factor of positing, of \npresumption, indeed, the operation of a type of transference, is thus absolutely \ncrucial: the emptiness of the Other, its non-existence as any definitive entity or \nsubstance, is a precondition of its persistence of its powers of social \nconsolidation. \nAs \u017di\u017eek (1996) explains, we are hence dealing with a \u201cmeaning to come\u201d \nwhich although it is never fully actualized, functions as if it is already effective. \nSo, by the time \u2018God\u2019 or \u2018Nation\u2019 works as a rallying-point for a group, it already \neffectively co-ordinates their activity, consolidates them as a society even though \neach of them might indeed have differing notions as to what \u2018God\u2019 or \u2018Nation\u2019 \nmight in fact be. In short, and here it is worth quoting \u017di\u017eek at length: \n\u2018Transference\u2019 designates the subject\u2019s trust in meaning-to-come\u2026 \nConsequently, in so far as the big Other functions as the guarantee of \nthe meaning-to-come, the very fact of the big Other involves the \nsubjective gesture of precipitation. In other words: how do we pass \nfrom the\u2026dispersed, inconsistent collection of signifiers to the big \nOther qua qua consistent order? By supplementing the inconsistent \nseries of signifiers with a Master-Signifier, S1, a signifier of pure \npotentiality of meaning-to-come; by this precipitation (the intervention \nof an \u2018empty\u2019 signifier which stands for meaning-to-come) the symbolic \nfield is completed, changed into a closed order (1996, pp. 144). \nThe same type of operation is found in how the Other functions as \u2018the third in \nevery dialogue\u2019, that is, as a principle of communicative intelligibility. As in \nattempts to fathom the Other, to grasp the key to social meaning, the subject also \nconfronts a type of unknowability in their communicative counterparts. Again, \n 12\nwhat is staged is a confrontation with a constitutive impossibility. Whether we are \ndealing with the primordial opacity of other subjects, or with the inability of \nsubjects to perfectly co-ordinate their communicative intentions, to become \ntransparent to one another, in either case we arrive at the very impossibility \nwhich links the subject to the social substance. This, \u017di\u017eek advances, is Lacan\u2019s \nanswer to the dilemma of how we move from the mere collection of others to the \ncollectivity, from the mutual reflection of other individuals to an impersonal reified \nOrder of social substance.  \nThe very impossibility of such a knowing of others, of such a perfected \ncommunicative interchange, of the social mass being jointly co-ordinated, gives \nrise to a virtual supplement \u2013 a kind of spiritual substance \u2013 which goes some \nway to helping us negotiate this impossibility. As \u017di\u017eek bluntly puts it, \u201cif \nindividuals were able to co-ordinate their intentions via shared knowledge, there \nwould be no need for the big Other\u201d (1996, p. 138). \nThe undecidability, the radical uncertainty in question, the lack of guarantee \nabout what my place is, or concerning what my partner\u2019s words, acts and \ncustoms mean, my attempts to determine the regulating \u2018rules of the game\u2019, \nthese problems, to reiterate, do not point to a deficiency, but rather to a positive \nontological feature of my social existence: \nthe ultimate proof of my inclusion in the big Other: the big Other \n\u2018functions\u2019 as the substance of our being, we are \u2018within\u2019 effectively \nembedded in it, precisely and only in so far as its status is irreducibly \nundecidable\u201d (\u017di\u017eek, 1996, pp. 136-137).  \n \nPrecipitate identification \n \nWhat should not be lost on us here is how we have returned to the concerns that \nopened this paper, that is, to the distinction between imaginary and symbolic \nidentification and, more directly, to the assertion that critical and social \npsychological analyses should focus particularly on the vicissitudes of symbolic \nmodes of identification. What is the link here between symbolic identification and \nthe function of the Other as Master Signifer? \nI emphasized above what it was that enabled the Other \u2013 the indivisible \nmediator between societal and subjective that precisely co-ordinates our \ncommunicative attempts \u2013 to operate as a Master Signifier. To reiterate: this co-\nordination, always more presupposed, transferential than real, is enabled not at \nthe level of the signified, not via some definitive shared content, but precisely at \nthe more open-ended level of the signifier. The factor of undecidablility is again \nhere key: what is being identified with is not some concrete image, some \ndelimited object of knowledge, but \u2013 indeed, a meaning-to-come - that which \nothers accept and identify with. Identification with a Master Signifier \u2013 something \nwe as socialized human subjects can barely avoid \u2013 is an odd sort of \nidentification, it is neither direct nor with anything substantial. It is not an \nidentification with any concrete thing; it is rather identification with the very \ngesture of identification, as \u017di\u017eek (1996) insists.  \n 13\nTo be sure: we are plugged into a similar social network by virtue of the \nfact of identifications with the indefinite, always open Master Signifier that others \nare also identified with. Hence the notion of a precipitate identification \u2013 no less \npowerful for such a status \u2013 that involves not a direct relation with an object, but \na relation with an inconclusive (Master) signifier that others have also taken on \u2013 \nagain a sense of the acceptance of what others accept \u2013 and have done so as a \nmeans of avoiding the uncertainty of their (our) social being. \n \nFoucault\u2019s Other \n \nIn what has gone above I have emphasized the spontaneity of the emergence of \nthe Other as the inevitable effect of the subject\u2019s engagement with symbolic \nstructure. I have suggested both that the appeal to the symbolic (to the Other) \nmay be driven by deadlocks of experience, and that the power-effects of \nknowledge and authority with which the Other is associated often far outstrip the \napparent material or empirical conditions of emergence. I have stressed also the \nhypothetical status of the Other, the factor of its virtuality, its transferential quality \nas locus of authority and truth. These are all valuable considerations in \nquestioning the functioning of social and psychological power.  \nBack then to Dolar\u2019s critique of Foucault: does Foucault not at times \neffectively rely, if not somewhat covertly, on something akin to the notion of the \nOther in his account of disciplinary mechanisms? This is precisely Dolar\u2019s (1999) \nargument. Foucault, he claims, is compelled to covertly introduce the Other, \u201cnot \njust as an effect produced by mechanisms, but as something that itself produces \neffects\u201d (p. 87). Moreover, it seems that Foucault makes assumptions about the \nstructure of subjectivity at work within disciplinary power which run counter to the \nnotion of the subject as merely the outcome of power.  \nDolar points particularly to the discrepancy in Discipline & Punish between \nFoucault\u2019s methodological proclamations (regards the specificity of instruments \nand locations of power) and the generalizability of the results of his analysis of \ndisciplinary power. Despite the diversity of procedures and tactics in the \ndisciplinary domain, the diagram of the Panopticon \u2013 which Foucault often treats \nas paradigmatic of modern power \u2013 easily unites these facets into a common \npattern. It is astonishing, ventures Dolar (1999), \nthat the multiplicity of dispersed and heterogenous micro-relations \nconverges into one single image of power which is entirely imbued \nwith the figure of the Other\u2026 Foucault\u2019s strategy of dispersed micro-\nrelations eventually converge in a\u2026massive presence of the Other (p. \n88). \nDolar recognizes that Foucault\u2019s account of disciplinarity dissolves the standard \nfigure-heads of power (the King, the Father, the Master, etc.). He appreciates \nalso Foucault\u2019s focus on the broader array of instruments and material \narrangements that would appear to supersede such singular authorities (the \narchitecture of the prison for example, its various systems of surveillance). The \nirony that remains however is that in the very gesture of removing the King, of \nvacating his place of power, one leaves an empty space that \u201cmakes his \n 14\npresence all the more pervasive and intractable\u201d (Dolar, p. 88). What is the \nelement of continuity \u2013 despite Foucault\u2019s protestations - that we may detect \nhere? Is there not a similar pattern of influence on display: the awareness of an \nOther that sees and knows, the presence of a presumed Other of authority that \nremains even if now this Other is present in the geometry of the prison or the \narchitecture of the school rather than in the embodied form of a sovereign figure?  \nEmptying out the contents of the Other, sheering it of its actual empirical \ndetail, its definitive object-status \u2013 as we have learned in reference to the Master \nSignifier \u2013 by no means destroys the power of its hold upon us - quite the \ncontrary. Similarly, as we know from Little Hans, the fact that there is no overt \nempirical Other, no intimidating father or conventional agent of power, poses no \nnecessary problem in generating effects of power (of an Other);  again, the \ncontrary seems the case. Doing away with the sovereign configuration of power \nby no means dissipates the Other, if anything \u2013 this is Dolar\u2019s argument \u2013 the \ndifferent measures of disciplinarity incur the Other ever more forcefully. Emptying \nthe place of power, notes Dolar, makes contingent events appear to be all the \nmore ruled by the invisible hand of the Other. So even though the Other is \ndiscarded by Foucault at the outset of his analysis of modern power, it \nnevertheless returns surreptitiously in the end, perhaps all the more haunting, all \nthe more powerful precisely because it has been elided. For Dolar then we \nseriously undercut the efficacy of our analyses of power, sociality or of \nsubjectivity if we do not take seriously the possibility of the Other, that is, of a \npoint of appeal and authority able to anchor subjects in the social-symbolic matrix \nof relations without itself being reduced to a secondary effect. \u201c[T]hat the Other \nemerges at all\u201d he says, \u201cthe supposition that\u2026there is a sense to be made, that \nthere is a knowledge... this is the kernel of both power and knowledge\u201d (p. 90). \n\u201cWithout the Other\u201d he concludes, \u201cthere is no \u2018effect\u2019 of power nor the \u2018psychic \neconomy\u2019 that makes it possible\u2026 Power works only if and as long as we \nassume the Other\u201d (1999, p. 92). \n \nConclusion: Retreiving the unconscious \n \nWithin this paper I have pointed in the direction of a prospective conceptual ally \nfor social psychological analyses. More specifically, I have suggested that \nLacan\u2019s notion of the big Other has much to offer both to social psychological \nconceptualizations of the subject-to-society relation and to critical psychological \nattempts to grasp how effects of authority, power and subservience are \ngenerated. Given the complex and often paradoxical nature of Lacan\u2019s concept \nof the Other I have opted for a descriptive rather than comparative analysis, \npreferring rather to demonstrate the explanatory usefulness of the term over a \nhasty attempt to liken it so a variety of existing psychological concepts. The latter \noption would no doubt detract from my attempt to foreground what is most \ndistinctive in this Lacanian notion.  \nThis is not to suggest that a subsequent discussion might not take up this \nobjective: linking the \u2018big Other\u2019 to a series of social psychological ideas which \nbear a certain resemblance to it, or that attempt similar kinds of analytical work. \n 15\nMead\u2019s \u2018generalized other\u2019 might provide one example, as would renderings of \nthe \u2018analytical third\u2019 (Ogden, 1994; Straker, 2006), or ideas of distributed \ncognition (Hutchins, 1995, Hutchins & Klausen, 1996) or even of socially-\nstructured mind (Turner & Oakes, 1997). I should hasten to add however that the \nStructuralist quality of much Lacan, like his insistence on the primacy of the \nsignifier over the subject \u2013 and his commitment to analyses of the functioning of \nthe unconscious structured like a language \u2013 precludes any easy assimilation \ninto orthodox psychological thought. At first glance this may seem to signal a \ndead-end to the broader project this paper proposes, namely a rejuvenation of a \ncritical psychoanalytic social psychology via Lacanian thought. Then again, the \nargument I am asserting in this paper would make little sense if it were not viable \nto align aspects of Lacanian theory with a given set of social psychological \nproblematics. To conclude then, some tentative comments regards how this \nconcept might be helpful in the analysis of a particular social psychological \nphenomenon, and how it might shift understandings of the individual-social \nrelation in social psychology in such a way that a novel form of critical \npsychology might be enabled. \nOne of the historical strengths of psychoanalytic understandings of racism \nhas been their ability to account for the tenacity of racist values, for the intensity \nof such beliefs and for the psychological structuring of such phenomena which \nappear to exceed exclusively sociological, discursive or historical explanations \nthereof (Clarke, 2003). By virtue of appeals to the unconscious and to certain \nvolatile ego-ideas psychoanalytic theorists have been able to theorize not only \nracism\u2019s resistance to change, but also its often explosive and eruptive nature, to \nappreciate that it often operates as a passionate world-view (Frosh, 1989; \nCohen, 2002). .Unfortunately however we have here a case where a traditional \nstrength overlaps with a fundamental weakness. What for many social and \ncritical psychologists is reduced out of consideration in such psychoanalytic \nexplanations are precisely the details of adequate historical and societal \ncontextualization. The profoundly political dimension to racist sociality is \neffectively elided, such is the claim, in analyses of intra-psychic dynamics that \nmake of racism an essentially individualized pathology of adjustment (Billig, \n1976; Dalaal, 2001).  \nWhat the Lacanian concept of the Other makes possible is that we may \nretain a form of explanatory reference to the unconscious \u2013 so crucial in \nfathoming racism \u2013 without reducing it either to the inner depth of repressed \nemotions or to an ostensibly a-social sphere of primal instincts within the singular \nsubject. Seshadri-Crooks (2000) makes this argument to great effect: the \nunconscious must not be grasped as a subterranean space opposed to \nconsciousness, or as an inchoate, swirling mass of repressed contents, but \nrather as the subjective locus of the Other or the symbolic order. Elsewhere, \n\u017di\u017eek (1994a) makes a similar point, reiterating the externality, and, as we might \nput it, the \u2018relationality\u2019 of the Lacanian unconscious which permits no easy \nseparation off of subject from society: \n[T]he concept of the unconscious is to be conceived\u2026as \u2018trans-\nindividual\u2019 \u2013 that is, beyond the ideological opposition of \u2018individual\u2019 \n 16\nand \u2018collective\u2019 unconscious: the subject\u2019s unconscious is always \ngrounded in the transferential relationship towards the Other; it is \nalways \u2018external\u2019 with regard to the subject\u2019s\u2026existence (p. 33). \nSeshandri-Crooks (2000) surveys a series of Lacan\u2019s postulates on the \nunconscious to draw the following conclusions which she intimates are vital to \nanalysis of racism: the unconscious is not a primal, archaic function; it is not a set \nof unorganized drives or repressed contents; it should not be viewed as a \ncollection of an individual\u2019s prohibited memories and desires. She (2000) points \nto Lacan\u2019s crucial qualification of Freudian doctrine, namely the idea that it is not \naffects that are repressed, but the ideational representatives of affects, which \nLacan understands within the rubric of the signifier. Hence Lacan\u2019s procedural \nfocus on the unconscious as occurring within the actions of speech, the idea, as \nemphasized above, that the Lacanian unconscious precisely is the processes of \nsignification beyond the control of the speaking subject. \nWe are left thus with a very different version of the unconscious to that \ntypically attributed to Freud. Its contents and their articulation are never, as it \nwere, pre-social, prior to language, or exclusively affective; they exist only by \nvirtue of the operation of the signifier (which, we should not forget, includes the \nfunctioning of potent Master-Signifiers). This is an external rather than internal \nunconsciousness, activated in the operations and performances of language, in \nthe subject\u2019s grappling with their place - relative to the Other\u2019s desire - in the \nsymbolic order. We have, in short, a fundamentally trans-individual \nunconsciousness, one which is instrumental, as I have tried to show, not only in \nthe replication of relations of power but also \u2013 inasmuch as it functions as  \nMaster-Signifier \u2013 of potent ideological beliefs and passionate world-views. \nTwo possibilities are thus immediately apparent for social psychological \naccounts of racism that wish to involve a broader sociological\/political frame of \nanalysis - thus avoiding the pitfalls of crude psychological reductionism - while \nstill operationalizing the notion of the unconscious.  Firstly, this Lacanian account \nof the unconscious bypasses the unhelpful circumscribing of a monadic subject \nwhose internal pathology permits no possibility of generalization (the problem, in \nother words, of reducing racism to personal psychology). Secondly, grasping the \nunconscious as the subjective locus of the Other means that we avoid falling into \nthe routine dualism of private versus public domains - a dualism which typically \nrisks de-politicizing racism. \nThis is something I have tried to highlight above: the linking into the social \nof the subject via the Other is constitutive of the subject. As such we should view \nthe unconscious less as \u201can individual construct than as an entity that bridges the \nsubject to\u2026signification\u201d, indeed, to social substance itself (Seshandri-Crooks, \n2000, p. 24). Moreover, given the subject\u2019s insertion into a shared universe of \nsignifiers \u2013 which come to represent their desire - the subject in their specificity \n\u201ccan come into existence only by borrowing the signifiers of its desire from the \nOther\u201d (Seshandri-Crooks, p. 24). It would represent too much of a further detour \nto elaborate upon the Lacanian maxim that follows on from this point in the \nargument, namely the assertion that desire is always the desire of the Other. The \nimplication, I would hope, is nonetheless clear: the seemingly private confines of \n 17\none\u2019s desire, like that of fantasy \u2013 and indeed racist fantasy \u2013 which come to \nshape and structure this desire, need always be grasped in reference to this \ntransferential relation to the Other, that is, in terms of the subjective locus of the \nOther. As schematic an offering as this is, I think it does at least signal a new \npossibility of collaboration between social psychological approaches focusing on \nthe discursive operations of racism and psychoanalytic perspectives on racist \nsubjectivity which insist on reference to the unconscious. \nTo end I wish to anticipate a prospective criticism of my project here, \nnamely the idea that Lacanian psychoanalysis should be rejected by social \npsychologists on the basis that it cannot be conceivably accommodated within \nthe theoretical\/methodological parameters of the discipline as it stands. I would \nadvance a very different position: perhaps it is the conceptual domain of the \nsocial psychological itself that needs be broadened, revised, even radically so, if \nthat is what is required for it to productively engage with advances in Lacanian \nthought. Reber\u2019s (1985) Dictionary of Psychology offers the following by way of a \ndefinition of social psychology: \nsocial psychology [is] the discipline that attempts to understand\u2026how \nindividuals are influenced by the actual, imagined or implied presence \nof others\u2026 Social psychology exchanges freely ideas, models and \nmethods with other social sciences (p. 709). \nWe might argue over the degree to which this statement concords with the \nreceptivity of today\u2019s social psychology to contributions of other disciplines.  What \nhowever seems difficult to deny is that the conversation regards how social and \ncritical psychology might profit from Lacanian psychoanalysis is by now long \noverdue.  \n \n \nReferences \nBadiou, A.
