Recently, however, \nsome authors have considered that these stressors have little heuristic value \nbecause they bear little or no relation to the environmental challenges an animal \nmay face in its natural environment. From a biological standpoint, it seems that \nthe social environment of a species can be a considerable source of stress \n(Blanchard et al., 1999; DeVries et al., 2003; Koolhaas et al., 1997). In many \nspecies, animals are organised in territories and a hierarchical rank of \ndominance is established. In such cases, social stress can be considered the \nstress resulting from the physical contact between animals (density and \nagonistic interaction) plus psychological components, like hierarchical instability \nand submission (Zayan, 1991).   \nSocial stress can affect several aspects of vertebrate physiology. Most \nstudies dealing with this subject were conducted on primates and small \nlaboratory mammals and in acute conditions, e.g., when animals are kept above \nstressor stimuli for a short period of time and the behavioural and physiological \nresponses are monitored during and shortly after the stressor had been \nremoved (Chrousos et al, 1995; Csermely, 1998). In fish, some studies have \nbeen carried out using the same procedure and the results obtained were \nsimilar to those found for other vertebrates, with activation of the pituitary-\n 4\nadrenal (PA) and sympathomedulloadrenal (SMA) axes (Flik et al., 2006; \nWendelaar Bonga, 1997).  \nThe social stress attributable to the interaction between conspecifics in \ntheir natural environment, or even on farms, can be considered much more a \nchronic than an acute stressor, according to the duration of exposure. If we \nconsider that most animal species use some behavioural strategies, like flight or \nhiding, to reduce their direct contact with other individuals, the stressor can also \nbe considered an intermittent one. \nAnimals exposed to chemical or physical stressors for long periods of \ntime are described as displaying physiological habituation, even in the presence \nof the stimulus (Barton, 1997; Colombo et al, 1990). Volpato and Fernandes \n(1994) did not hypothesise that this happens in the same manner when animals \nare subjected to social stressors. Social interactions between conspecifics are, \nat least for some fish species, dynamic processes, where sub-dominants are \nfrequently trying to become dominants and these latter ones are trying to \nmaintain their dominant status, using direct attack or signs to the others. Thus, \nthe aim of this study was to determine whether rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus \nmykiss, show habituation to chronic intermittent social stress in the context of \nfish hierarchical rank. To that end, a social intermittent condition of pairing was \nimposed chronically on juvenile rainbow trout, and some known stress \nindicators (i.e., growth rate, cortisol, growth hormone, glucose, total protein, free \namino acids) were measured before, during and after the social contact was \nabolished. \n \n 5\nMethods \nThe experimental design consisted of monitoring selected indices of \nstress in rainbow trout before, during and after exposure to chronic intermittent \nsocial stress of dominance. \nSixteen 1-year-old immature rainbow trout, (Annandale strain, mean \nweight = 215 \u00b1 33.5 g), were removed from the population of fish maintained in \n1500-liter capacity outdoor circular fiberglass tanks, supplied with a constant \nflow of water (from Lake Windermere) at 30 litre min -\u00b9 at ambient temperature. \nFish were distributed individually among 16 75-liter indoor glass aquaria, also \nsupplied with a constant flow of lake water (1.5 litre per min) at the same \ntemperature as that in the holding tanks (Center of Ecology and Hydrology, \nWindermere Laboratory, UK). Water temperature during the experimental \nperiod was between 10 and 16\u00b0 C. Fish were fed once daily with commercial \npellets (BP Mainstream, BP Nutrition UK Ltd) at a rate of 3% of body weight. \nThe photoperiod was maintained constant with light-dark cycle of 14h:10h. Fish \nwere considered acclimated when all of them were observed feeding normally \n(more than 50% of the offered pellets), which occurred after 15 days under lab \nconditions. \nAfter the acclimation period, all the isolated fish were removed from the \ntroughs, rapidly anaesthetised (2-phenoxyethanol, 1:2000) and a blood sample \nwas collected from the Curverian sinus (~ 0.5 ml) using 1.0-ml heparinized \nsyringe. The blood was kept on ice until the completion of sampling when it was \ncentrifuged (3000g at 4oC for 10 min). Separated plasma was transferred to a \ncapped polypropylene tube and stored frozen (-20oC) until required for assay. \n 6\nThe fish were weighed before returning to their tanks. This moment was \nconsidered the starting point of the experiment.  \nAnimals were maintained in isolation for a 14 days period (early isolation \n- EI) in order to get standard values of the measured parameters. Immediately \nafter this procedure, ten pairs were formed, with fish having a minimum body \nweight difference of 10% between individuals within each pair. To allow for \nindividual identification of the specimens used, each experimental fish was \nmarked with aqueous alcian blue dye on its right or left ventral surface delivered \nby a Panjet needleless injector (Wright Dental Co.). Each pair was introduced \ninto another 75-liter tank to avoid the establishment of a resident-intruder \nparadigm. In order to expose the fish to intermittent chronic social contact, fish \nwere maintained in direct contact with each other for the first 24 hours of \npairing. At the end of this time we could identify the dominant and subordinate \nfish.  Dominant fish were considered those that presented bright colour, moved \nthroughout the aquarium and displayed agonistic attacks against the other most \nof the time. Subordinate fish displayed dark colour, low locomotion activity and \nflight from the coespecific attacks. Thus a black plastic screen partition was \nintroduced in each tank, preventing direct contact between the members of \neach pair. Every day during the afternoon, the partition was taken away for 30 \nminutes to allow physical interaction between animals (to reproduce intermittent \nsocial contact). Fish were fed daily in the morning before the partition was \nremoved to avoid potential effects of stress from agonistic interactions and from \nhandling the partition at feeding. Fish were maintained in this pairing condition \n(PA) for 8 days, at the end of which they were sampled using the same \nprocedure described above, and returned to the isolation condition (final \n 7\nisolation - FI), where they were maintained for another 13 days. During this 3rd. \nperiod animals are sampled more frequently in order to monitor the recovery \nresponses after the stressor was abolished, as indicated. \n        EARLY ISOLATION (EI)          PAIRING (PA)               FINAL ISOLATION (FI) \n  \n     1                               14                               22       24         29          35 DAYS \nBoth plasma cortisol and growth hormone (GH) were determined by \nestablished, well-validated radioimmunoassays (Pickering and Christie, 1981; \nRand-Weaver et al., 1992). Glucose levels were measured using a \ncommercially available kit (SIGMA Diagnostics- quantitative, enzymatic \n[Glucose Oxidase] determination, procedure no. 510). Total protein \nconcentration and plasmatic amino acids were quantified using a colorimetric \nmethod (Onhnishi and Barr, 1978; Matthews et al., 1964). \nChanges in body weight are expressed as Specific Growth Rate (SGR = \n[ln Wf \u2013 Wi \/ days] x 100), where Wf and Wi represent the final and initial body \nweight in a period of days, respectively. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA \nfollowed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc multiple comparisons test was used to compare \nthe effects of social status and experimental periods (early isolation (EI), pairing \n(PA) and final isolation (FI)) on growth parameters (SGR and \u0394SGR) and \ncortisol, glucose, protein and amino acids secretion rates. From a plot of \nresiduals against fitted values, appropriate transformations were selected to \nimprove the homogeneity of variance (cortisol: sgrt(x); glucose: 1.0\/x; protein: \nln(x); amino acids: 1.0\/x). As it was not possible to find an appropriate \ntransformation for GH values, Friedman\u2019s two-way analysis of variance  \nfollowed by the LSD test was used to compare, individually, subordinate and \n 8\ndominant animals on different moments. To compare mean GH levels between \ndominants and subordinates in each moment, Wilcoxon matched pairs test was \nused. For Specific growth rate, hormones and metabolic substrates secretions \nthe Pearson Correlation Test was established. Statistical significance was set at \n5% in all analyses. \nResults \nChanges in body weight from dominant and subordinate fish are shown \nin Fig. 1. Statistical analysis of specific growth rate (SGR - Fig. 1A) using a two-\nway repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post hoc multiple \ncomparisons test revealed significant effects of experimental periods on SGR (F \n= 10.25, P < 0.001), and of social status on SGR (F = 5.72, P < 0.05). However, \nthe interaction between moment and social status was not statistically \nsignificant (F = 2.96, P > 0.05), indicating that the pattern of growth specific rate \nremained different between dominant and subordinate fish throughout the \nexperiment. Subordinate animals showed a negative specific growth rate (SGR) \nmean value at the end of 8 days of pairing, which was significantly different from \nthe other moments (Fig. 1A: EI\/PA, P<0.001; FI\/PA, P = 0.02). The dominant \ngroup, on the other hand, showed no significant change in SGR among \nmoments and no weight loss was detected during the whole experimental \nperiod. Differences in growth between the hierarchical groups were found in the \ngrouping period (PA \u2013 dominants\/subordinates, P = 0.003).  \nThe impact of pairing on fish growth can be better demonstrated by \nconsidering the variation in the specific growth rate (\u0394SGR) between periods \nPA-EI and FI-PA for dominants and subordinates (Fig. 1B). According to the \nresults obtained by the same statistical procedure used with SGR, fish from \n 9\nboth hierarchical ranks were negatively affected by pairing, a fact indicated by \nnegative \u0394SGR in PA-EI for both dominants and subordinates. When we \nconsider \u0394SGR between FI and PA, positive values were obtained for both \ndominants and subordinates, meaning that both groups increased their growth \nduring the third period compared with the second. However, the magnitude of \ngrowth was different: subordinates showed significantly lower \u0394SGR when \ncompared to dominants in \u0394PA-EI (P = 0.04) and only subordinates presented a \nsignificantly different value when comparing \u0394PA-EI with \u0394FI-PA (P = 0.02). No \nsignificant difference was found between dominants and subordinates in the \nmean of \u0394FI-PA (P = 0.1).  Such results indicate that fish of both hierarchical \nstatus lost weight in the pairing period, but subordinate lost significantly more \nthan dominants. When fish are isolated again (FI) both dominant and \nsubordinate fish increased the weight rate, but subordinates did it significantly \nmore than dominants.  \nThe effect of intermittent social stress on plasma cortisol and growth \nhormone levels are presented in Fig. 2. Only dominant fish had a significantly \nhigher plasma cortisol levels after 8 days of pairing (PA - day 22) compared with \nthe earlier isolation period (EI: day 1, P = 0.01; day 14, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). \nTwo days after the stressor had been abolished (FI - day 24), fish of both \nhierarchical rank had cortisol levels significantly decreased compared with \npairing (days 24 \u2013 22, for dominants P = 0.002; for subordinates P = 0.047), \nwith values similar to the early isolation period. However, after one week in \npost-pairing isolation (FI - day 29), the cortisol level of dominants was \nsignificantly higher compared with the entire early isolation period and final \nisolation day 24 (days 1, 14, 24, P < 0.001). Only on day 29 there was a \n 10\nsignificant difference on cortisol levels between dominants and subordinates (P \n= 0.03), what means that fish of both hierarchical rank had a similar cortisol \nsecretion throughout the experimental condition, but dominants showed a more \nintense response what reflected in significance in this group, but not in \nsubordinates. Growth hormone levels (Fig. 2B - GH) showed the highest \nindividual variability of all features measured. Friedman ANOVA followed by \nLSD post hoc test did not indicate any difference among time points for either \ndominant (\u04b32 = 10.15, p = 0.12) or subordinate animals (\u04b3 2 = 18.12, p = 0.09). \nComparison between hierarchical ranks using Wilcoxon paired ranks test \nindicated that subordinates had a significant higher level of GH than dominants \nonly on the second day after pairing (FI - day 24, P = 0.03), even though fish of \nboth social rank showed a very low hormone concentration at this moment (less \nthan 0.2 ng\/ml) and it is the only moment that subordinate fish presented a \nhigher level of GH than do dominants.   \nEnergetic substrate levels are shown in Fig. 3. Although there were no \ndifferences in glucose means between dominants and subordinates in any \ncondition, subordinate fish had a significant lower glucose level at the end of the \npairing period (day 22) when compared with all the other days, except for day 1 \n(day 14, P = 0.005; day 24, P = 0.003; day 29, P = 0.03; day 35, P = 0.02); and \ndominants showed a significant increase in glucose level after the stressor was \nabolished (day 24) compared with the previous time point 2 days earlier (PA \u2013 \nday 22, P = 0.03) (Fig. 3A).  \nBoth groups had a significantly higher level of protein 2 days after the \nstressor had been removed, when compared to levels on day 1 (day 24:  \ndominants \u2013 P = 0.02; subordinates \u2013 P = 0.004). When amino acids levels are \n 11\nconsidered, we observed that one week after the stressor had been removed \n(FI - day 29), subordinate animals showed significantly decreased amino acids \nlevels compared with day 1 (P = 0.004) and day 24 (P = 0.04) followed by a \nsignificant increase on day 35 (compared with day 1, P = 0.01; days 14, 22, 24, \n29, P < 0.001). When animals are compared according to the social rank, amino \nacid levels in dominant fish were significantly higher than in subordinates on \ndays 29 and 35 (day 29, P = 0.002; day 35, P = 0.04), suggesting a different \nphysiological adjustment between dominant and subordinate rainbow trout \ninvolving this metabolic substrate.  According to Pearson correlation test results, \nno relationship between specific growth rate and hormones, specific growth rate \nand energetic substrate, or hormones and energetic substrate was detected.  \nDiscussion \nThis study showed that intermittent chronic social exposure is a stressful \ncondition for both subordinate and dominant rainbow trout and no habituation \noccurred after 8 days under this condition. However, the two hierarchical ranks \ndo not present exactly the same range of responses and an enormous \nindividual variation of the data among fish of the same hierarchical condition is \nevident.  \nIt is presumed that under stress there is a reallocation of metabolic \nenergy away from investment activities like growth toward activities required to \nrestore homeostasis such as respiration, locomotion, hydromineral regulation, \nand tissue repair (Volpato and Fernandes, 1994; Alvarenga and Volpato, 1995; \nBarton, 2000). Another common idea in the literature is that in fish species \nwhere hierarchical ranks are well established, dominant fishes represent a \nstressor for subordinate ones, and subordinates usually show several \n 12\ndevelopmental consequences like decreases in growth and reproduction rates \n(Fernandes and Volpato, 1993; Wendelaar Bonga, 1997).  Results obtained in \nthis study are in agreement with the notion that subordinate fishes have their \ngrowth rate suppressed in the presence of dominants. However, the growth rate \nof dominants also decreased after the pairing period even though the rate \nremained positive. Thus, the magnitude of the response was different for each \nsocial rank. The significantly higher \u0394SGR presented for subordinates in FI-PA, \ncompared both with dominants at the same moment and among themselves at \nthe moment PA-EI, suggests that when the stressor was abolished, \nsubordinates grow at a higher rate than dominants. In terms of energy \nmobilisation, we can infer that during pairing, subordinate fish spent more \nenergy than dominants on activities inherent to stress to the detriment of \ngrowth, but when the stressful condition is abolished, subordinates exhibit, for \nsome period, a more intense investment in growth than dominants. Such a \nphenomenon is denominated compensatory growth and has been frequently \ndescribed for fishes submitted to periods of low food availability (Metcalfe and \nMonaghan, 2001). In this study, food was offered daily ad libitum when fish \nwere separated by the partition but, as food intake was not quantified, it is not \npossible to know if the suppression and subsequent increase in growth rate was \ndue to an exchange of food ingestion or of the energy available for growth. In \nany case, the growth responses are correlated with the effect of stress on fish \nmetabolism, since competition for food did not occur. \nThe partition used to avoid direct contact between conspecifics did not \nsuppress the stress condition for either dominant or subordinate fish. It needs to \nbe tested whether that response was promoted by high aggression shown daily \n 13\nwhen the partition was removed or resulted from another stimulus presented \neven with the partition, such as vision or chemicals. Although we did not \nquantify the agonistic profile when the partition was removed, we could observe \nthat in most of the pairs fish were very aggressive, promoting subordinate death \nin 2 extra pairs during this period.  \nCortisol is an important hormone involved in the chronic stress response \nin vertebrates (Chrousos et al., 1995; Csermely, 1998; Pickering and Pottinger, \n1995; Slominski, 2000; Landys et al., 2006). In this study, dominant and \nsubordinate animals presented a very similar response in plasma cortisol at all \ntime points considered, except after pairing when dominants showed significant \nincrease compared with subordinates. Although opposite results have been \nobtained with rainbow trout (Pottinger and Carrick, 2001; Sloman et al., 2001; \nSloman et al., 2002; Fox et al., 1997), in which subordinates showed higher \ncortisol values than dominants, in all described studies fishes were in direct \ncontact with each other. In the experimental procedure used herein, fish-to-fish \ncontact was limited to 30 minutes\/day and probably a more aggressive \nbehaviour than usually displayed by dominants was involved with such cortisol \nresponse. The bimodal response of fish in the third period was unexpected. As \nblood samples were always collected in the afternoon, the differences cannot \nbe ascribed to circadian fluctuations. The same type of response was obtained \nin rainbow trout following acute stress from manipulation (Farbridge, 1992). \nThose authors concluded that the cyclic pattern resulted from the rapid turnover \nof the hormone, followed by new secretion by the interrenal tissue, which \nperhaps occurred in the present experiment. Another interesting result obtained \nin our study was that one week after cessation of pairing, cortisol levels of \n 14\ndominants were higher than those of subordinates, suggesting a different \nrecovery time for the two hierarchical ranks. \nThe plasma GH values obtained in the present study were low in all \ngroups at all time points considered and showed a large variation (high SEM) \nwhen compared with published data for the same specie under similar \nconditions (Kakizawa et al., 1995). The reports on circulating GH levels in \nstressed fish are inconsistent and difficult to interpret (Wendelaar Bonga, 1997). \nPlasma GH levels have been reported to increase after injection stress in \ngoldfish (Cook and Peter, 1984) and to remain unaffected in chum salmon after \nhandling stress (Wagner and Mckeown, 1986). The role of GH in social \ninteraction is considered by some authors as indirect, by increasing swimming \nactivities or inducing defense of a larger territory, thereby increasing the \nencounter rate between opponents (Jonsson and Bjornsson, 1994). According \nto P\u00e9rez-S\u00e1nchez and Le Bail (1999), a chronically high level of cortisol induces \nmarked derangement of the GH axis; the predominant effect of acute stress \nmay be the increase of GH release, whereas that of chronic stress could be a \nsuppressive response. Farbridge and Leatherland (1992) suggested that in \nrainbow trout cortisol has a suppressive effect on GH, which possibly was the \ncase in the present study.  \nSecondary stress indicators presented a very similar pattern of change \nbetween dominant and subordinate ranks. Although a higher value for free \namino acids was obtained for dominants in the final phase of the recovery \nperiod (days 29 and 35) compared with subordinates, on the last day both \ndominants and subordinates had a higher level of amino acids than at any prior \ntime, suggesting a role of these substrates in the increased growth activities.  \n 15\nAccording to McEwen and Wingfield (2003), allostatic load can be considered \nas the energy requirement of an animal resulting from the daily and seasonal \nroutines plus the extra energy it needs to find a mate, breed, avoid predadors, \nand so on. So, it contemplates the predictable events, like life history stages, \nand unpredictable situations like food deprivation, predators or social \ncompetitions. Social status may have an intense influence on allostatic load \nwhat is directly proportional to concentration of glucocorticoids presented by an \nanimal (Goymann and Wingfield, 2004). Considering this idea, we can infer that \nthe experimental condition used in our study promoted a dramatic increase in \nallostatic load of both social ranks, what reflected in reduced growth rate from \ndominants and subordinates, among others. When the pairing conditions was \nabolished, the physiological adjustment from dominants and subordinates were \ndifferent according to variations on values of growth rate, cortisol and amino \nacids, for example, suggesting an different pattern of perception and \/or \nadjustment to the new condition for dominants and subordinates.      \nDifferent recovery times (and different responses to intermittent social \npairing) can be related to different stress conditions imposed, i. e., the stressor \nis not the same in both groups. To subordinates, the stressors are the presence \nof dominant fish, the bites and chases resultant from interactions when they \nwere in direct contact with conspecifics plus the condition of submission. For \ndominants, the stressor is the presence of subordinates waiting to become \ndominant at the first opportunity and probably the impossibility of defining the \ndominance properly.    \nWe can conclude that keeping rainbow trout in a chronic condition of \nintermittent social stress represents a stressful condition for both dominants and \n 16\nsubordinates. For subordinates the response seems to be more intense, but \nwhen the stress condition is abolished, subordinates tended to recover more \nquickly than dominants. The condition of daily short direct contacts between \nconspecifics does not seem to promote habituation in fish. In fact, the procedure \nused seems to represent a potent stressor for both members of the pair. We \ninfer that in a more natural condition the interaction among fish must be an \nintermediary between what we used in this study, that did not permit to \ndominant keep your position properly and a continuous direct contact usually \nused in experiments involving social interaction, where subordinate is not able \nto emigrate away from the dominant fish.    \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors thank Toby Carrick and Lidsey Jones for technical support, \nand Maryan Rand-Weaver and John Sumpter for the GH quantification.
