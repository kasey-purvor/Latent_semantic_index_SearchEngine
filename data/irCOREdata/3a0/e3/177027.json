It produces high-quality research information on the costs,\neffectiveness and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care in\nthe NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined to include all interventions used to promote health,\nprevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care, rather than settings of care.\nThe research findings from the HTA Programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the\nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee\n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that\nthey form a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA Programme is needs-led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are\nthree routes to the start of projects.\nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the\nNHS, the public and consumer groups and professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS trusts.\nThese suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service\nusers). The HTA Programme then commissions the research by competitive tender.\nSecondly, the HTA Programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research\nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThirdly, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme\ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together\nevidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They can\ncost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence,\nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer-reviewed by a number of independent expert referees\nbefore publication in the widely read monograph series Health Technology Assessment.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA monograph series\nReports are published in the HTA monograph series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA\nProgramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and editors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search,\nappraisal and synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the\nreplication of the review by others.\nThe research reported in this monograph was commissioned by the National Coordinating Centre for\nResearch Methodology (NCCRM), and was formerly transferred to the HTA Programme in April 2007\nunder the newly established NIHR Methodology Panel. The HTA Programme project number is\n06\/90\/13. The contractual start date was in March 2003. The draft report began editorial review in March\n2007 and was accepted for publication in April 2007.

Part B: interviews with\npeople playing a wide range of roles within four trials\nthat their funders identified as \u2018exemplars\u2019. Part C: a\nlarge multicentre trial (the CRASH trial) of treatment\nfor head injury. \nReview methods: The study used a number of\ndifferent perspectives (\u2018multiple lenses\u2019), and three\ncomponents. Part A: an epidemiological review of a\ncohort of trials. Part B: case studies of trials that\nappeared to have particularly interesting lessons for\nrecruitment. Part C: a single, in-depth case study to\nexamine the feasibility of applying a business-\norientated analytical framework as a reference model\nin future trials. \nResults: In the 114 trials found in Part A, less than\none-third recruited their original target within the time\noriginally specified, and around one-third had\nextensions. Factors observed more often in trials that\nrecruited successfully were: having a dedicated trial\nmanager, being a cancer or drug trial, and having\ninterventions only available inside the trial. The most\ncommonly reported strategies to improve recruitment\nwere newsletters and mailshots, but it was not\npossible to assess whether they were causally linked to\nchanges in recruitment. The analyses in Part B\nsuggested that successful trials were those addressing\nclinically important questions at a timely point. The\ninvestigators were held in high esteem by the\ninterviewees, and the trials were firmly grounded in\nexisting clinical practices, so that the trial processes\nwere not alien to clinical collaborators, and the results\ncould be easily applicable to future practice. The\ninterviewees considered that the needs of patients\nwere well served by participation in the trials. Clinical\ncollaborators particularly appreciated clear delineation\nof roles, which released them from much of the\nworkload associated with trial participation. There was\na strong feeling from interviewees that they were\nproud to be part of a successful team. This pride fed\ninto further success. Good groundwork and excellent\ncommunications across many levels of complex trial\nstructures were considered to be extremely\nimportant, including training components for learning\nabout trial interventions and processes, and team\nbuilding. All four trials had faced recruitment\nproblems, and extra insights into the working of trials\nwere afforded by strategies invoked to address them.\nThe process of the case study in Part C was able to\ndraw attention to a body of research and practice in a\ndifferent discipline (academic business studies). It\ngenerated a reference model derived from a\ncombination of business theory and work within\nCRASH. This enabled identification of weaker\nmanagerial components within CRASH, and initiatives\nto strengthen them. Although it is not clear, even\nwithin CRASH, whether the initiatives that follow from\ndeveloping and applying the model will be effective in\nincreasing recruitment or other aspects of the success\nof the trial, the reference model could provide a\ntemplate, with potential for those managing other\ntrials to use or adapt it, especially at foundation \nstages. The model derived from this project could \nalso be used as a diagnostic tool if trials have difficulties\nand hence as a basis for deciding what type of\nremedial action to take. It may also be useful for\nauditing the progress of trials, such as during external\nreview. Conclusions: While not producing sufficiently definitive\nresults to make strong recommendations, the work\nhere suggests that future trials should consider the\ndifferent needs at different phases in the life of trials,\nand place greater emphasis on \u2018conduct\u2019 (the process\nof actually doing trials). This implies learning lessons\nfrom successful trialists and trial managers, with better\ntraining for issues relating to trial conduct. The\ncomplexity of large trials means that unanticipated\ndifficulties are highly likely at some time in every trial.\nPart B suggested that successful trials were those\nflexible and robust enough to adapt to unexpected\nissues. Arguably, the trialists should also expect agility\nfrom funders within a proactive approach to\nmonitoring ongoing trials. Further research into\ndifferent recruitment patterns (including \u2018failures\u2019) may\nhelp to clarify whether the patterns seen in the\n\u2018exemplar\u2019 trials differ or are similar. The reference\nmodel from Part C needs to be further considered in\nother similar and different trials to assess its\nrobustness. These and other strategies aimed at\nincreasing recruitment and making trials more\nsuccessful need to be formally evaluated for their\neffectiveness in a range of trials.\nAbstract\nivHealth

All rights reserved.\nBackground\nRandomised controlled trials are widely accepted\nas the gold standard for evaluating healthcare\ninterventions. If, however, the target sample \nsize is not achieved, the trial\u2019s results will usually\nbe less reliable. If recruitment has to be \nextended to reach the required sample size, \nthis will delay the use of the results in clinical\npractice, and usually cost more, so fewer trials can\nbe conducted within the limited resources\navailable. \nObjectives\nIt is unclear why certain trials recruit well whereas\nothers do not. The aim was, therefore, to identify\nfactors associated with good and poor recruitment\nto multicentre trials. \nMethods \nThe study used a number of different perspectives\n(\u2018multiple lenses\u2019), and three components: Part A:\nan epidemiological review of a cohort of trials\nfunded by the UK\u2019s Medical Research Council\n(MRC) and Health Technology Assessment (HTA)\nProgramme; Part B: case studies of trials that\nappeared to have particularly interesting lessons\nfor recruitment; and Part C: a single, in-depth\ncase study of a large multicentre trial to examine\nthe feasibility of applying a business-orientated\nanalytical framework as a reference model in\nfuture trials. \nPart A was based on 114 multicentre MRC and\nHTA Programme trials that started in or after\n1994 and were due to end before 2003. \nWhereas in Part A the planned level of\nrecruitment was used as a surrogate measure for\nthe \u2018success\u2019 of a trial, Part B was based on in-\ndepth analyses of 45 interviews with people\nplaying a wide range of roles within four trials that\ntheir funders identified as \u2018exemplars\u2019 (trials which\nhad met, or were scheduled to meet, agreed\ntargets and that the funders publicised as\nsuccesses). \nPart C complements the emphasis on trial\n\u2018processes\u2019 in Parts A and B in a case study of a\nlarge multicentre trial (the CRASH trial) of\ntreatment for head injury. \nResults\nIn the trials found in Part A, less than one-third\nrecruited their original target within the time\noriginally specified, and around one-third had\nextensions. Factors observed more often in trials\nthat recruited successfully were: having a dedicated\ntrial manager, being a cancer or drug trial, and\nhaving interventions only available inside the trial.\nHowever, these findings should be interpreted\ncautiously: the confidence intervals were wide;\nassociations were, at best, only marginally\nstatistically significant; and the trend for some\nfactors was towards a negative association. The\nmost commonly reported strategies to improve\nrecruitment were newsletters and mailshots, but it\nwas not possible to assess whether they were\ncausally linked to changes in recruitment. \nThe analyses in Part B suggested that successful\ntrials were those addressing clinically important\nquestions at a timely point. The investigators were\nheld in high esteem by the interviewees, and the\ntrials were firmly grounded in existing clinical\npractices, so that the trial processes were not alien\nto clinical collaborators, and the results could be\neasily applicable to future practice. The\ninterviewees considered that the needs of patients\nwere well served by participation in the trials.\nClinical collaborators particularly appreciated\nclear delineation of roles, which released them\nfrom much of the workload associated with trial\nparticipation. There was a strong feeling from\ninterviewees that they were proud to be part of a\nsuccessful team. This pride fed into further\nsuccess. Good groundwork and excellent\ncommunications across many levels of complex\ntrial structures were considered to be extremely\nimportant, including training components for\nlearning about trial interventions and processes,\nand team building. All four trials had faced\nrecruitment problems, and extra insights into the\nworking of trials were afforded by strategies\ninvoked to address them. Teams within trials that\nExecutive summaryx\nwere not exemplars were not interviewed, and\nhence it is not known to what extent the\nperceptions observed in these exemplars differed\nfrom those in trials that were less successful. \nThe process of the case study in Part C was able to\ndraw attention to a body of research and practice in\na different discipline (academic business studies). It\ngenerated a reference model derived from a\ncombination of business theory and work within\nCRASH. This enabled identification of weaker\nmanagerial components within CRASH, and\ninitiatives to strengthen them. Although it is not\nclear, even within CRASH, whether the initiatives\nthat follow from developing and applying the\nmodel will be effective in increasing recruitment or\nother aspects of the success of the trial, the\nreference model could provide a template, with\npotential for those managing other trials to use or\nadapt it, especially at foundation stages. The model\nderived from this project could also be used as a\ndiagnostic tool if trials have difficulties and hence\nas a basis for deciding what type of remedial action\nto take. It may also be useful for auditing the\nprogress of trials, such as during external review. \nConclusions\nWhile not producing sufficiently definitive results\nto propose strong recommendations, the work\nhere suggests that people undertaking future \ntrials ought at least to think about the different\nneeds at different phases in the life of trials, and\nplace greater emphasis on \u2018conduct\u2019 (the process\nof actually doing trials). This implies learning\nlessons from successful trialists and trial managers,\nwith better training for issues relating to trial\nconduct.\nThe complexity of large trials means that\nunanticipated difficulties are highly likely at some\ntime in every trial. Part B suggested that \nsuccessful trials were those flexible and robust\nenough to adapt to unexpected issues. Arguably,\nthe trialists should also expect agility from funders\nwithin a proactive approach to monitoring\nongoing trials.\nRecommendations for research\nThree important areas for further research arise.\nFirst, an extension of Part B to trials with different\nrecruitment patterns (including \u2018failures\u2019) may\nhelp to clarify whether the patterns seen in the\n\u2018exemplar\u2019 trials differ or are similar. Second, Part\nC was based around a single large trial with the\nunusual feature that patients were mainly\nunconscious. Before use as an audit tool for\ndiagnosing and\/or addressing management\nfactors, the reference model needs to be\nconsidered in other similar and different trials to\nassess its robustness. Finally, these and other\nstrategies aimed at increasing recruitment and\nmaking trials more successful need to be formally\nevaluated for their effectiveness in a range of\ntrials.\nExecutive summaryBackground\nThe importance of the randomised\ncontrolled trial\nThe randomised controlled trial (RCT) is widely\naccepted as the gold-standard design for\nevaluating healthcare interventions.1,2 Its principal\nbenefits are widely known; for example, the\ngroups generated should only differ by chance in\nbaseline prognostic variables, the potential for\nattribution is maximised and the results can be\nanalysed using standard statistical testing.\nDecision-makers are increasingly looking to the\nresults of RCTs to guide practice, and RCTs are\nnow a major and increasing component of NHS-\nsupported research and non-commercially funded\nresearch more generally.3 For example, the UK\nMedical Research Council (MRC), in its recent\nreview of clinical trials, considers that RCTs are\nthe \u201cmost scientifically rigorous, unbiased way of\ncomparing alternative healthcare interventions\u201d.4\nSuccessful delivery of RCTs\nIt is important that trials are conducted ethically\nand efficiently. However, several issues can hamper\nthe successful delivery of trials. These include\nbarriers to patient participation, barriers to\nclinician participation, poor design, poor conduct,\npoor analysis, poor reporting and other obstacles\nsuch as complex consent procedures.5 One of the\nmost commonly reported problems with the\nconduct of multicentre RCTs, however, is that\nrecruitment is slower or more difficult than\nexpected, with many trials failing to reach their\nplanned sample size within the timescale and\nfunding originally envisaged.6 If the target sample\nsize is not achieved, the trial has less statistical\npower to detect potentially important clinical\ndifferences between the groups, so the results may\nbe less useful.7 In addition, if recruitment has to\nbe extended to reach the required sample size, the\ntrial will cost more and take longer, delaying the\nuse of the results in clinical practice. If trials\nbecome more expensive and take longer, fewer\ntrials can be conducted overall with the limited\nfunding and resources available, and hence less\ninformation will be available to the NHS. There is\ngrowing policy concern in the UK that trials are\nincreasingly not achieving planned recruitment\ntargets.\nTo recruit successfully to an RCT depends on a\nnumber of factors beyond that of a good design,\nincluding: (1) the formal authorisation of the trial,\nfor example by research ethics committees (RECs);\n(2) the active participation of clinicians or\ncollaborating researchers; and (3) the participation\nof patients. There has been considerable discussion\nabout whether patients are increasingly less willing\nto participate in RCTs.8,9,10 If, however, steps (1)\nand (2) are not fulfilled, then patients are unlikely\nto be in a position either to refuse or to accept\nparticipation. For the formal authorisation of a\ntrial, REC and NHS Research and Development\n(R&D) approval is generally required, which can\noften be a lengthy process. In addition, successful\nparticipation of clinicians generally requires the\nfulfilment of a number of key roles: that they agree\nto participate in the RCT when invited, offer\nparticipation in the trial to eligible patients, recruit\neligible patients, and comply with the procedures\noutlined in the trial protocol.5 Each of these stages\nrepresents a potential barrier to the successful\ndelivery of a trial.\nThe reasons why certain trials recruit well while\nothers do not remain unclear. Several potential\nlimiting factors have been identified in the\nliterature,5 including constraints on clinician\ntime,11,12 lack of available staff,13 impact on clinician\nautonomy and complexity of trial procedures.14\nMost of these factors were identified from surveys of\nresearchers or clinicians involved in research, and\nare summarised in reviews.5,15 Qualitative work in\nselected perinatal trials explored the factors that\ninfluenced doctors\u2019 willingness to propose the trial\nto parents.16 Some of the key factors that influenced\nthe clinicians were their degree of commitment to\nthe trial, their understanding of the scientific\nbackground to the trial, time factors, confidence\nabout handling the clinical procedures required, a\nsense of ownership and good communication with\nsenior staff about the trial. The more junior doctors\nidentified the need for more support from senior\nstaff, as well as for training.\nSpecific strategies to improve\nrecruitment\nThere are several reports in the literature of\nclinical trials and elsewhere where specific\nstrategies implemented to improve recruitment\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n1\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.\nChapter 1\nIntroductionyielded large changes in recruitment rates. A\nrecent example in clinical trials is that of the\nORACLE (Role of Antibiotics in Curtailing Labour\nand Early Delivery) trial,17 where the introduction\nof a number of research midwives had a dramatic\neffect on subsequent recruitment rates. The use of\ndata from these \u2018natural experiments\u2019 may provide\nparticularly useful lessons for the formulation of\nstrategies to counter failing recruitment. A\nsystematic review of trials of strategies to increase\nrecruitment in research studies was recently\npublished in which a total of 18 trials was\nidentified, including a total of 39,516\nparticipants.18 The effectiveness of six different\nstrategies aimed at participants was evaluated.\nSeven trials evaluated the effect of providing\npotential participants with additional information,\nfour examined the relative effectiveness of different\nconsent procedures, three evaluated the effect of\nprewarning, two the use of incentives, one the\neffect of using a placebo and one trial evaluated\nthe effect of different types of invitation letter.\nThere were, however, no trials of interventions to\nimprove recruitment in multicentre studies, nor\ntrials on how to ensure that study participation is\nroutinely offered to patients.\nLessons from research other than\nhealthcare\nThe studies mentioned above have all been\nconducted within the healthcare environment;\nhowever, many other organisations have sought to\ninfluence and enrol others. For example, in\nbusiness some firms have sought to develop long-\nterm, mutually advantageous relationships with\npartners, customers and clients, often with\nbeneficial results. Indeed, improving\ninterorganisational relationships is so well\nestablished that \u2018relationship marketing\u2019 and\n\u2018partnering\u2019 are extensively discussed in current\nbusiness literature. Thus, the application of\nanalytical frameworks from outside the healthcare\nenvironment may shed new light on the challenge\nof recruiting and sustaining trial sites.\nThe commissioned research\nIt was against this background that the National\nCoordinating Centre for Research Methodology\n(NCCRM) (through funding from both the\nDepartment of Health and the MRC)\ncommissioned research to identify the factors that\nare associated with good and poor recruitment to\nmulticentre trials. Particular emphasis was placed\nin the commissioning brief on the participation of\ncollaborating researchers. \nThe research project\nReflecting the commissioning brief, the research\nproject outlined in this monograph aimed to\nidentify the factors associated with good and poor\nrecruitment to multicentre trials, concentrating\nparticularly on the participation of collaborating\nresearchers. It also considered the wider issue of\nwhat counts as a successful trial, broadening the\ndebate from recruitment alone. \nResearch approach adopted\nTo try to understand the potential factors associated\nwith good and poor recruitment more fully, this\nproject undertook to examine recruitment from a\nnumber of different perspectives: a \u2018multiple lens\u2019\napproach. Multiple lens approaches have been used\nwidely in social science for the examination of\ncomplex phenomena, organisations or processes.\nThe concept behind the multiple lens approach is\nthat individual perspectives give interesting insights\ninto the situation or procedure under examination,\nbut implicitly lead us to interpret the issues in\ndistinctive yet partial ways. When taken together,\nhowever, they give a much wider and insightful\nvision of the underlying issues. An example of this\napproach from the field of organisational behaviour\nwas the research undertaken by Morgan19 to\nexamine the ways in which organisations function.\nHe viewed organisational behaviour from a number\nof different perspectives (e.g. from the perspective\nof organisations as machines, organisms and\ncultures). These perspectives, when considered\nindividually, gave interesting and different insights\ninto the organisation, but when taken together gave\na much wider and more rounded insight into the\nunderlying issues. As recruitment to trials is a\ncomplex process, the present authors decided to\nadopt this multiple lens approach to their\ninvestigation. \nIndividual components of the research\nReflecting this innovative approach, the project,\nknown as STEPS (Strategies for Trials Enrolment\nand Participation Study), had three distinct\ncomponents (all of which could stand alone but\nwhich, when taken together, might provide insights\ngreater than the sum of the individual parts).\nPart A: An epidemiological review of a cohort of\ntrials funded by the MRC and the NHS HTA\nProgramme\nThe aim of this component of the study was to\nexplore documentation held by funders on a\ncohort of trials. These documents provide a rich\ndescription of factors that may influence\nrecruitment to multicentre trials, as progress\nIntroduction\n2towards recruitment targets is explicitly monitored\nand any problems with recruitment are\nhighlighted, together with any strategies adopted\nto improve recruitment. The aims were to describe\nthe characteristics of the trials in terms of factors\nthat may affect the success of recruitment (e.g.\nlevel of funding, complexity of trial design,\ninvolvement of a trials support unit), to describe\npatterns of recruitment observed; and to describe\ntrialists\u2019 reports of factors perceived to be\nassociated with good or poor recruitment (e.g.\ndelays in obtaining funding or ethics approval)\nand strategies attempted to improve recruitment.\nPart B: Case studies of trials that appeared to\nhave particularly interesting lessons for\nrecruitment\nThe aim of this component was to explore in more\ndepth trials that may be considered to be\n\u2018exemplars\u2019 with regard to recruitment. The aims\nwere to examine these exemplars from a variety of\ninternal perspectives; to consider the impact of\nthe unique conditions of the individual trials on\nrecruitment; and to make comparisons across trials\nwith regard to a wide range of factors that might\naffect recruitment.\nPart C: A single, in-depth case study of a large\nmulticentre trial\nThe aim of this component was to examine, in a\nsingle ongoing multicentre trial [the MRC\nCorticosteroid Randomisation After Significant\nHead Injury (CRASH) trial], the feasibility of\napplying a business-orientated analytical\nframework to trial recruitment (i.e. if the trial were\na business, what policies, practices and capabilities\nwould be needed for the marketing challenges to\nbe met). The aim was to develop a reference\nmodel for potential use in future trials.\nThe STEPS group\nThe research in the STEPS project was undertaken\nby a collaborative group, the majority of whose\nmembers had significant experience of conducting\nlarge multicentre RCTs. The group was\nmultidisciplinary in background, including trial\nmanagers, epidemiologists, statisticians and social\nscientists. Although separate components of the\nresearch were each led by a subgroup of the\ncollaboration (Part A: AM, RK, MC, AG; Part B:\nCS, JG, DE; Part C: DF, IR), the STEPS group met\non several occasions to discuss the work in\nprogress as a whole, and all contributed to the\nwhole project.\nOutline of report\nReflecting the aims and objectives outlined above,\nChapter 2 describes the epidemiological review of\ntrials funded by the MRC and HTA Programme.\nAn epidemiological description of the cohort of\ntrials is outlined together with the exploration of\nspecific hypotheses of factors that may affect\nrecruitment. Chapter 3 describes the results of four\ncase studies (two funded by the MRC and two\nfunded by the HTA Programme) of trials that were\ndeemed to have particularly interesting lessons for\nrecruitment. The synthesis of interviews\nintegrating the perspectives of a number of\ndifferent trial members [e.g. the principal\ninvestigator (PI), the trial manager or equivalent,\nthe lead clinical investigator, and other clinicians\ninvolved directly in recruiting at local centres] is\ndescribed. Chapter 4 describes the application of a\nbusiness-orientated analytical framework to the\nMRC CRASH trial. A reference model that could\nbe used to assess the sales and marketing\ncapability of a trial is proposed. In Chapter 5 the\nproject is discussed as a whole, finishing with\nrecommendations for practice and for further\nresearch.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n3\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.Background\nFor every trial funded by the UK MRC and the\nUK NHS HTA Programme, the PI and co-\napplicants must initially submit a full scientific\napplication to the funder outlining the rationale\nfor the trial, the required sample size and the\nexpected recruitment rate. Once the trial is\nunderway, regular progress reports, annually for\nMRC trials and 6-monthly for HTA Programme\ntrials, must be submitted to the funder outlining\nthe progress of the trial against the original\ntimeline and expected milestones. Within these\nreports, progress against recruitment targets is\nexplicitly monitored and any problems with\nrecruitment are highlighted, together with any\nstrategies adopted to improve recruitment. If\nfurther funding or an extension in time, or both,\nis requested, a formal application is made. The\napplication and reporting documents submitted by\ntrial teams to funders provide a rich description of\nrecruitment to multicentre trials and factors that\nmay influence recruitment.\nThis component of the project aimed to draw on\nthese documents to describe recruitment to a\ncohort of multicentre trials funded by the MRC\nand the HTA Programme, and to explore factors\nthat may have influenced good or poor\nrecruitment.\nAims\nThe specific aims and objectives of this component\nof the research were:\n\u25cf to describe the trials in terms of broad study\ncharacteristics such as population, intervention\nand outcomes\n\u25cf to describe patterns of recruitment observed\nsuch as to original plan or better, slower start\nthan anticipated, recruitment with identifiable\nchange-points, etc.\n\u25cf to characterise the trials in terms of factors that\nmight affect the success of recruitment, such as\nlevel of funding, complexity of trial design or\ninvolvement of a trials support unit\n\u25cf to describe trialists\u2019 reports of factors perceived\nto be associated with good or poor recruitment\n(e.g. delays in obtaining funding or ethics\napproval) and strategies attempted to improve\nrecruitment\n\u25cf to consider any changes in overall recruitment\npattern over time (based on year in which\nrecruitment commenced).\nMethods\nIdentification of trials\nTrials were identified from the databases of trials\nheld by the two funding bodies. Trials were\ndeemed eligible for inclusion in the study if:\n\u25cf they involved more than one clinical centre;\n\u25cf recruitment to the trial started on or after\n1 January 1994 (this cut-off was chosen as the\nHTA Programme was established during 1993);\nand\n\u25cf the planned end-of-recruitment date (as in\napplication\/first protocol) occurred on or before\n31 December 2002. Trials where the intention\nwas that recruitment would close by \n31 December 2002, but were later awarded an\nextension to the recruitment phase beyond \n31 December 2002, were included (if they had\nsubsequently closed to recruitment prior to data\nextraction).\nTrials were specifically excluded from this study if\nthey had adopted a cluster randomised design.\nRecruitment issues are different for cluster RCTs\nas often individual participants are not\napproached for consent, rather consent is given\nfor specific clusters of participants by a cluster\n\u2018guardian\u2019.20 It was, therefore, felt that reasons for\ngood or poor recruitment would be systematically\ndifferent between individually randomised and\ncluster randomised trials.\nDeviations from the original plan of\nwork set out in the application form\nThe original intention was to include multicentre\ntrials funded from 1997 onwards (when the MRC\nreporting structure began). It became evident that\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n5\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.\nChapter 2\nAn epidemiological review of a cohort of trials \nfunded by the MRC and the NHS HTA programmethis would not generate an adequate number of\ntrials in the cohort. The inclusion criteria were\nthus amended to include multicentre trials that\nstarted recruitment on or after 1 January 1994\n(this cut-off was chosen as the HTA Programme\nwas established during 1993).\nAccess to information\nFollowing discussions with staff at MRC and the\nNational Coordinating Centre for the HTA\nProgramme (NCCHTA), it was agreed that the\nstudy researchers would be given access to\napplication forms and progress report details on\nsite at each organisation, subject to appropriate\nconfidentiality safeguards. The structure of current\nprogress reports is outlined in Appendix 1.\nResearchers signed confidentiality agreements at\nboth sites. The MRC and HTA Programme\ncontacted all nominated PIs by letter before the\nrecords for their project were reviewed. It was\nagreed that any material deemed confidential or\nof a sensitive nature that made it irrelevant or\ninappropriate to the data extraction exercise\nwould be removed before the files were passed to\nthe researchers. This did not prove necessary in\npractice.\nData extraction\nData were extracted from trial reports under six\nstructured headings:\n\u25cf trial identifying details\n\u25cf trial administrative details (e.g. date of\napplication submission, date funding\ncommenced, date ethics approval received, date\nrecruitment commenced)\n\u25cf trial features (e.g. did the trial have a pilot\nphase, were the trial team multidisciplinary, was\nthere a dedicated trial manager, were\nconsumers involved, trial design, trial setting)\n\u25cf finance (i.e. overall funding awarded together\nwith any supplementary awards provided)\n\u25cf summary of overall recruitment, including\noriginal recruitment target (sample size sought\nin specified period as stated in the grant\napplication), any revisions to recruitment\ntargets, and final recruitment numbers\n\u25cf description of components of delay or failure to\nreach recruitment target, including factors such\nas delays to centre recruitment, delays to\nparticipant recruitment and any strategies\nadopted to attempt to improve recruitment.\nThe data extraction form (Appendix 2) and\nprocedures were piloted on data from eight trials\nfunded by the HTA Programme (data from these\ntrials were also subsequently formally extracted\nusing the finalised data extraction form). This\nenabled the process and contents of the data\nextraction form to be refined. Two researchers\n(RK, AM) performed the data extraction (each\nextracted information from both MRC trials and\nHTA Programme trials). For the first few trials, the\nresearchers worked together on the data\nextraction, to agree working rules for the\ndefinition and classification of terms. Following\nthis, formal definitions of terms (e.g. definition of\nmultidisciplinary input) were developed to aid the\nstandardisation of data extraction and are\npresented in Appendix 3.\nSecondary data sources\nFor some data items, information was not recorded\nor was unclear in some trial reports held by the\nfunders. In such situations, reports of the specific\ntrials held on the Current Controlled Trials meta-\nregister of randomised trials (www.controlled-\ntrials.com) and the NCCHTA website\n(www.ncchta.org) were also searched in an attempt\nto augment the dataset. The Current Controlled\nTrials meta-register is an international database\ncombining several registers of ongoing clinical trials\nand includes registers of UK-funded trials (e.g.\nNational Research Register). For some trials, PIs\nwere also asked to provide additional information.\nTo avoid overloading PIs, especially for information\nabout trials that had long since closed, contact was\nonly made when a \u2018core\u2019 item of data, such as the\nfinal recruitment figure, was missing.\nAnalysis\nClassification of recruitment \u2018success\u2019\nRecruitment was classified as \u2018successful\u2019 if a trial\nrecruited to or over 100% of its original target,\nirrespective of time-frame. Further analyses were\nbased on trials that recruited at least 80% of their\noriginal recruitment target. A sensitivity analysis\nwas performed, treating trials that stopped early\nowing to differential effects as having had\nsuccessful recruitment.\nGeneration of a priori research hypotheses of\nfactors that might affect recruitment\nTo protect against being data driven in the\nexploration of factors that might affect\nrecruitment, a number of a priori hypotheses to be\ntested was developed. These hypotheses were\ngenerated within the project management group\nand were based on issues raised in previous\nliterature reviews5 and insights gained from the\nMRC clinical trials enquiry4 (AG and IR were both\nmembers of the main review panel of the MRC\nclinical trials enquiry). The specific hypotheses\nwere that:\nAn epidemiological review of a cohort of trials funded by the MRC and the NHS HTA programme \n6\u25cf Trials with complex designs (more complex\nthan a parallel group trial, e.g. factorial trials)\ndo not recruit as well as simple trials.\n\u25cf Less well funded trials do not recruit well (this\nwas initially operationalised as trials with less\nthan \u00a3500,000 funding, but subsequently\noperationalised as trials with less than \u00a31000\nper planned participant).\n\u25cf Trials without dedicated trial management\nexpertise do not recruit as well as those with\ntrial management expertise (defined as a\nperson responsible for the day-to-day\ncoordination).\n\u25cf Trials with multidisciplinary input recruit better\nthan those that do not have this input.\n\u25cf Trials that involve consumers recruit better than\nthose that do not.\n\u25cf Trials where the intervention is only available\ninside the trial recruit better than those where\nthe intervention is available outside the trial.\n\u25cf Trials that have had a successful pilot phase\n(defined as either a pilot or feasibility study that\naddressed anything to do with recruitment,\nincluding changes to trial documentation)\nrecruit better than those that do not have a\npilot phase.\n\u25cf Trials that have dedicated, paid local\ncoordinators recruit better than those that do\nnot.\n\u25cf Cancer trials recruit better than non-cancer\ntrials.\n\u25cf Drug trials recruit better than non-drug trials.\n\u25cf Trials funded through response-mode funding\nhave different recruitment rates to those funded\nthrough a commissioned process.\nStatistical analysis\nData were collated and stored in a specially\ncreated database (MS Access, version 2000) and\nanalyses were performed using SPSS (version 11).\nFrequency tables were generated to summarise the\noverall trial characteristics. Associations between\ntrial characteristics and recruitment success were\ngenerated through the use of 2\u00d72 tables. Odds\nratios (ORs) of recruitment success are presented\ntogether with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nStatistical levels of association were examined\nthrough the use of the \u00012 test, or the \u00012 test for\ntrend where appropriate.\nResults\nDescription of included trials\nSummary of included trials\nOne-hundred and fourteen trial grants fulfilled\nthe inclusion criteria. Forty-one (36%) of these\ntrials were funded through the HTA Programme\nand the remaining 73 (64%) trials funded by the\nMRC. Some of the trial grants supported more\nthan one trial: three grants included two subtrials,\none grant had three subtrials and one trial grant\nhad four subtrials. For the purposes of describing\nthe trial features, the denominator is based on the\nnumber of trial grants (i.e. 114), whereas for the\nanalysis of recruitment issues the denominator is\nbased on all trials (including subtrials) (i.e. 122\ntrials).\nTrial design\nTrial designs are summarised in Table 1. Across all\ntrials (including the eight subtrials) the large\nmajority were simple parallel group trials\n(113\/122, 93%). Six trials adopted a factorial\ndesign, and another three adopted a partially\nrandomised, patient preference approach.\nThe majority were two-arm (93\/122, 76%) trials.\nThere were 18 (15%) three-arm trials and 12 (9%)\ntrials with more than three arms (factorial trials\nare coded here as multiarm trials; for example a \n2 \u00d7 2 factorial would be a four-arm trial under this\ncoding). \nTrial setting\nA wide range of clinical areas was covered (Table 2).\nCancer trials accounted for 20% of the total.\nMental health and orthopaedics\/rheumatology\neach accounted for a further 17% of the total.\nObstetrics and gynaecology also accounted for a\nsizeable percentage of the trials (7%).\nApproximately half (64\/122, 53%) of the trials\nwere based in a hospital setting. A further 21%\nwere based in a general practice setting, 6% in a\ncommunity setting and 13% in a mixed setting\n(Table 2). Across these different settings, just over\nhalf (52%) involved recruiting centres that were\ngeographically spread out over a number of\nregions. Twenty-five (22%) trials involved\nrecruiting centres that were outside the UK.\nTrial interventions\nTrial interventions are summarised in Table 3.\nNearly one-third of the trials involved drugs\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n7\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

There\nwere 12 (10%) trials in which the intervention was\nbased on a form of behavioural therapy.\nChemotherapy, different types of surgical\ninterventions, new service provision and radiology\nalso accounted for sizeable percentages of the\ninterventions.\nFor the majority of trials (77%), trial interventions\nwere available outside the study; for only 18 trials\nwas it clear that one or more interventions were\nnot available outside the trial.\nTrial funding\nTrial funding ranged from \u00a316 per planned\nparticipant to \u00a34522, with a median of \u00a3641 per\nplanned participant. Trial funding was classified as\n\u2018good\u2019 if applicants were awarded more than\n\u00a31000 per planned participant for the conduct of\nthe trial. Using this assumption, 24 (24\/89, 27%)\ntrials were awarded a \u2018good\u2019 level of funding.\nPilot phase\nSixty (53%) trials had a pilot phase, of which 58%\n(35\/60) were funded pilots (Table 4). Of these, 32\ntrials indicated that the recruitment strategy was\nchanged as a result of the pilot study. The most\ncommon changes noted on the basis of pilot\nstudies were that written trial materials were\nmodified (eight trials), the trial design was\nchanged (six trials), changes were made to the\ninclusion criteria (four trials), the recruitment\ntarget was changed (six trials), and the number of\nsites was increased (four trials).\nTrial coordination and disciplinary representation\nEighty-nine (78%) trials were coordinated from a\ntrials support unit and 86 (75%) trials had a\nAn epidemiological review of a cohort of trials funded by the MRC and the NHS HTA programme \n8\nTABLE 2 Setting of Part A trials\nNn (%)\nClinical areas 122\nCancer 25 (20.5)\nMental health (including neurosciences\/psychiatry\/psychology) 21 (17.2)\nOrthopaedics\/rheumatology (including back pain) 21 (17.2)\nObstetrics and gynaecology 9 (7.4)\nPrimary care 8 (6.6)\nCardiology 5 (4.1)\nGastroenterology  5 (4.1)\nIncontinence\/urology 5 (4.1)\nHIV\/AIDS 5 (4.1)\nVascular 4 (3.3)\nMinor surgery 3 (2.5)\nRespiratory disease 3 (2.5)\nDermatology 2 (1.6)\nDental 2 (1.6)\nGerontology 1 (0.8)\nCerebrovascular 1 (0.8)\nHearing research 1 (0.8)\nOphthalmology 1 (0.8)\nSetting 122\nCommunity 7 (5.7)\nGeneral practice 26 (21.3)\nHospital 64 (52.5)\nMixed 16 (13.1)\nMissing 9 (7.4)\nGeographical spread 122\nRegional 51 (41.8)\nMultiple regions 63 (51.6)\nMissing 8 (6.6)\nAny recruiting centres outside UK 114\nYes 25 (22.0)\nNo 88 (77.2)\nMissing 1 (0.8)dedicated trial manager (Table 4). Seventy-five\n(75\/86, 87%) of those trials with a dedicated trial\nmanager were coordinated from a trials unit.\nNinety-two per cent (104\/113) of trials had\nmultidisciplinary involvement (defined as\nmedical\/dental\/nursing expertise plus at least one\nother discipline) across the trial applicants\n(Table 5), with statistics (73%) and economics (58%)\nthe highest represented disciplines after clinical\nexpertise.\nNine trials indicated that they had some form of\nconsumer involvement, although no trial had a\nconsumer as a grant applicant. Trialists most\ncommonly identified that they had access to\nappropriate consumer bodies\/patients with the\nrelevant condition (five trials), although in some\ncases specific roles for the consumer were noted:\nrepresentation on the trial steering committee\n(one trial), reviewer of trial literature (one trial)\nand referee of the final report (one trial).\nRecruitment in included trials\nSummary of overall recruitment\nRecruitment target varied widely across trials, from\na minimum of 60 to a maximum of 66,000.\nRecruitment in the trials is summarised in Table 6.\nThirty-eight (31%) trials were assessed to have\nrecruited \u2018successfully\u2019 (i.e. \u2265100% of their original\ntarget). A further 29 (24%) of trials achieved a\nrecruitment rate of at least 80% but less than\n100% of their original target. Thirteen trials\nrecruited to their original target after a time\nextension. Fifty-five (45%) trials recruited below\n80% of their original recruitment target. In 42\n(34%) trials the recruitment target was revised over\nthe course of the trial. The target was revised in an\nupward direction in six of these trials. Of the 42\ntrials that revised their target, 19 (45%) recruited\n100% or more of their revised target, 15 (36%)\ntrials recruited at least 80% but less than 100% of\nrevised target, and eight trials did not achieve\neven 80% of the revised target.

Enrolment was halted before the formal\nend of the recruitment period in 14 trials. In 11 of\nthese, this decision was related to poor\nrecruitment. In the three others, early termination\nfollowed a recommendation from a data\nmonitoring committee (DMC) that there were\nclear differences between the trial groups.\nHowever, in two of these, the recruitment period\nhad already been extended beyond that originally\nspecified.\nExtensions to trials\nSixty-six (54%) trials requested an extension to \nthe trial grant to complete the original trial; \nin all but one of the cases either a time-only\nextension or a supplementary grant was awarded.\nWhere an extension was awarded, in 42 (64%)\ncases this was for both a time extension and a\nsupplementary grant. For the remainder, 15 \n(23%) were for a time-only extension and eight\n(12%) were for a supplementary grant only. Only\n19 (45%) trials whose targets were revised were\nknown to have successfully recruited to their new\ntarget.\nDelays at different phases of recruitment \nDelay to overall start of recruitment\nIn 47 (41%) trials, the overall start to the\nrecruitment was delayed (Table 7). The main\nreasons cited were: delays related to central trial\nstaff (11 trials), delays related to local research\nstaff (11 trials) and delays related to local clinical\narrangements (seven trials) (Table 8). Other\nreasons identified included a range of issues, such\nas delays with ethics, the supply of study\ndrugs\/placebo, the development of clinical\nguidelines, which then impacted on the trial, the\nPI moving, adverse publicity about research and\nthe publishing of conflicting research (Table 8).\nRecruitment of centres\nEighty-six (75%) trials indicated that they had\npreidentified centres in the application for\ninclusion to the trial. In 17 of these, however,\nthere was some level of failure in bringing in some\nof the preplanned centres (Table 9). There\nappeared to be no common reason for these\nfailures, although the issue of problems with time\ndelays resulting in technology advances was\nidentified (three trials), as were cost issues (raised\nin two cases).\nAn epidemiological review of a cohort of trials funded by the MRC and the NHS HTA programme \n10\nTABLE 5 Disciplines represented amongst trial investigators\nlisted as applicants in Part A trials (N = 113a)\nYes No\nn (%) n (%)\nMultidisciplinary 104 (92) 9 (8)\nDisciplines represented\nConsumer \u2013 113 (100)\nEconomics 66 (58) 47 (42)\nHealth Services Research 35 (31) 78 (69)\nMedical\/dental 109 (96) 4 (3)\nNursing  22 (19) 91 (80)\nStatistics 83 (73) 30 (26)\nOther 17 (15) 96 (85)\na Data were missing for one trial.\nTABLE 7 Delays to different stages of recruitment in Part A\ntrials\nNn (%)\nOverall start to recruitment delayed 114\nYes 47 (41.2)\nNo 64 (56.1)\nMissing 3 (2.6)\nEarly participant recruitment \nslower than expected 122\nYes 77 (63.1)\nNo 35 (28.7)\nMissing\/not clear 10 (8.2)\nLate participant recruitment \nslower than expected 122\nYes 46 (37.7)\nNo 60 (49.2)\nMissing\/not clear 16 (13.1)\nTABLE 6 Recruitment in Part A trials (N = 122)\nn (%)\nRecruited successfully\nYes 38 (31.1)\nNo 84 (68.9)\nWas recruitment target revised?\nYes 42 (34.4)\nNo 76 (62.3)\nMissing 4 (3.3)\nFinal recruitment figure\nOriginal target (N = 122)\n\u2265100% 38 (31.1)\n\u226580% but <100%  29 (23.8)\n<80% 55  (45.1)\nRevised target (N = 122)\n\u2265100% 19 (45.2)\n\u226580% but <100% 15 (35.7)\n<80% 8 (19.1)Health Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n11\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The most commonly\nreported reasons included problems with\ncosts\/funding (13 trials), delays in the recruitment\nof research staff (12 trials) and changes with the\nMREC system (six trials).\nFifty-two (45%) trials reported that they had to\nrecruit new centres to ensure the delivery of the\ntrial. \n\u2018Early\u2019 participant recruitment\nOnce centres were enrolled into the trials, early\n(within the first approximately 25% of recruiting\ntime) recruitment was reported to be slower than\nanticipated in 77 (63%) trials (Table 7). The most\ncommon reasons noted for this are outlined in\nTable 10, and included fewer eligible patients than\nexpected (19 trials), internal problems (e.g. staff)\n(18 trials) and a smaller percentage of patients\nagreeing to participate than expected (16 trials).\nOther problems included: issues with\nprocedures\/interventions (e.g. randomisation,\nplacebo (five trials), the absence of perceived\nclinical equipoise (four trials) and conflicting\nworkload pressures (three trials).\n\u2018Later\u2019 participant recruitment\nThere were also delays to later (within the last\napproximately 75% of recruiting time) recruitment\nreported in 46 (38%) trials (Table 7). The most\ncommon reasons noted in this phase (outlined in\nTable 11) were internal problems (e.g. staff) (ten\ntrials), a smaller percentage of patients agreeing to\nparticipate than expected (nine trials), and fewer\neligible patients than expected (seven trials).\nOther problems were numerous, and included\nissues such as conflicts with other trials (five trials)\nand long waiting lists (three trials).\nRecruitment rates related to year recruitment\nstarted\nData describing recruitment rates for all years\nwhen recruitment started are summarised in\nFigure 1.

An\nassociation suggesting that the factor increased the\nchances of successful recruitment is indicated by\nan odds ratio of greater than unity. For each\ncomparison, only trials for which the information\nwas known were included (i.e. trials where the\ninformation was unclear or missing were\nexcluded). Subtrials were included. Ninety-five per\ncent confidence intervals are presented for all\nodds ratios.\nAs Table 12 shows, the confidence intervals around\nthe odds ratio estimates were all wide, reflecting\nthe maximum sample size (122). Some of the\ncomparison cells had very few data (e.g. number\nwith a complex design and number with consumer\ninput). There were marginally statistically\nsignificant associations with being funded by the\nMRC, being a cancer trial and not having paid\nlocal trial coordinators.\nStrategies to improve recruitment\nSeventy-three trials reported the use of at least one\nstrategy (range one to five strategies) aimed at\nimproving recruitment (Table 13). A variety of\nstrategies was reported; the most commonly\nreported strategy was the use of newsletters and\nmailshots, both to participants and to clinical staff,\nto promote the trial. There were reports of\nadvertisements in newspapers and journals.\nPosters and information leaflets were displayed in\nappropriate clinics and wards and these were\nsometimes backed up by regular phone calls and\nvisits. Several trials reported that sites had been\nsupplied with resource manuals and that specific\ntraining had been held for staff recruiting\npatients. Another commonly reported strategy was\nthe trial being presented to appropriate clinical\ngroups and presentations at relevant national and\ninternational meetings. Ten per cent of the trials\nreported that the trial inclusion criteria were\nchanged or the protocol was amended in an effort\nto improve recruitment.

Unfortunately, no trial was\nfound to display particularly marked changes in\nrecruitment rates and no analyses based on\nspecific recruitment patterns were possible.\nDiscussion\nThis description of a complete historical cohort of\ntrials has shown that failure to achieve projected\ntargets for participant recruitment has been\ncommon in multicentre trials supported by the two\nmain funders of trials in the UK.

The\nbasis of the investigation was that the \u2018outcome\u2019 of\nrecruitment to a predefined target (original sample\nsize estimate) is a true measure of success. Often\ninitial sample size calculations are based on limited\ninformation and, as such, the use of this marker as\na sole indicator of recruitment success is rather\nunsatisfactory. Initial sample size estimates can be\nviewed more as an informed guide, based on\nimperfect information (that may change as new\ninformation emerges from external sources) and\nconsiderations such as feasibility and cost. Sample\nsize targets do, however, contribute to the decision-\nmaking process when funding decisions are made\nand, as such, the degree to which a trial delivers to\ninitial expectations can be viewed as a legitimate\nmarker of trial success. In an ideal situation,\nparameters other than achievement of planned\nsample size, such as rates of participant retention\nand treatment compliance, should also be taken\ninto account. Furthermore, recruitment can be\nviewed as a surrogate measure of other, less easily\nquantifiable, but arguably more significant measures\nof success, such as \u2018impact on clinical practice\u2019 or\nthe extent to which the trial question has been\nsuccessfully addressed. In terms of recruitment, it\nwas anticipated that some of the apparent failure to\nreach recruitment targets might have been due to a\nDMC\u2019s recommendation to halt the trial. In fact, in\nonly three cases did a DMC recommend closing\nrecruitment because of clear differences in outcome\nbetween the trial groups; in two of these, however,\nthere had already been an extension to the\nrecruitment period because the rate had been\nslower than planned. Sensitivity analyses treating\nthese three as having \u2018successful recruitment\u2019 had\nlittle impact on the results, although they did\nstrengthen somewhat the association between\nsuccess and a trial having a dedicated trial manager.\nAnother limitation is that the operationalisation of\nvariables used to address the research hypotheses\nof factors that might affect recruitment (the\n\u2018exposures\u2019) was based on pragmatic\nconsiderations which could not always reflect\nsubtle variations in the underlying concepts. For\ninstance, different trials need quite different levels\nof funding and the choice of a standard cut-off of\n\u00a31000 per planned participant was arbitrary. \nThere are also some worries about the validity of\nthe data. There was marked variation in the quality\nof the reporting across the 114 studies. This was\nparticularly noticeable between the two funders;\nprimarily a reflection of the specific requirements\nof the reporting form. The reporting form for the\nHTA Programme is more extensive and requires\ngreater detail for correct completion. It is also\ncompleted 6-monthly rather than annually. \nAs a result of the variation in reporting quality,\nthere was a considerable amount of missing data\nin the data set following the initial extraction of\nthe data from the records kept by funders. In an\nattempt to maximise the data available for\nanalysis, several complementary strategies were\nused to augment the funder data. The first extra\nsource of data was electronic registers of trials:\nreports of trials held on the Current Controlled\nTrials meta-register of randomised trials and \nthe NCCHTA website were searched for \nadditional information. Second, PIs were asked \nto provide information where core items were\nmissing. Third, trial managers registered with \nthe UK Trial Managers Network (see below) \nwere contacted for specific information (where\nthey were known to have had links with specific\ntrials). Finally, the STEPS team reviewed each trial\nrecord and provided supplementary information\nwhere it was known (e.g. whether the trial team\nhad coordinated more than one trial\nsimultaneously).\nThis process of supplementary data gathering was\nparticularly resource intensive. The authors\nbelieve, however, that the final data set is much\nricher as a result of this extra work and helped to\nprovide sufficient information to allow data\nanalysis to be undertaken. Despite all these extra\nefforts, however, a proportion of data items\nremained unclear for most trials and this is\nreflected in the varying numbers of trials\ncontributing to each separate analysis.\nIt had been hoped that the study would identify\nfactors associated with successful (or unsuccessful)\nrecruitment to provide a means of predicting or\nenhancing the chances of success. The factors\nexamined were chosen in advance based on\nprevious research5 and the experience of members\nof the research team. It is possible that other\nfactors, such as characteristics of the trialists that\nwere not included, might have been more\ninformative. In the event, the comparative analyses\nthat were performed were of limited value, both\nbecause of the choice of outcome and exposure\nvariables, and because of imprecision around the\nestimates of association. While a number of these\nanalyses provide some evidence that some factors\n(e.g. the intervention only being available inside\nthe trial, having a dedicated trial manager, and\nAn epidemiological review of a cohort of trials funded by the MRC and the NHS HTA programme \n16being a cancer trial or a drug trial) were associated\nwith successful recruitment, these results (although\nless so for cancer trials) were also all compatible\nwith there being no association. Furthermore,\nother analyses showed that some features expected\nto enhance recruitment were less commonly\nobserved in \u2018successful\u2019 trials than in \u2018unsuccessful\u2019\ntrials. This applied in particular to \u2018local paid\nrecruitment coordinators\u2019, but alternative\nexplanations for this apparent negative association\nare that this comparison is confounded by other\nfactors such as the complexity of the trial and the\nyears when it was undertaken (see below). As many\nof the variables are potentially correlated, a\nmultivariable analysis would have been desirable.\nThere was insufficient power, however, to\nundertake this analysis with any degree of\nreliability; experts suggest that there should be at\nleast ten observations in the data set for each\npotential explanatory variable to be included in the\nmodel.21 A multivariable analysis was performed\nand the results confirmed the lack of power:\ncoefficients were often in the \u2018wrong\u2019 direction and\nstandard errors for certain coefficients were large,\nindicating instability in the model.\nThere was an apparent difference in recruitment\nsuccess rates between the funders, with MRC-\nfunded trials more likely to recruit to target. This\nis potentially a reflection of the different grant-\nawarding processes, as the HTA Programme\ncommissions specific trials, whereas the MRC\noperates in response mode and this is reflected in\nmarkedly different portfolios in the two\norganisations.3 There was also evidence that this\nobservation may have been confounded by other\nfactors. Cancer trials, drug trials and trials with a\ndedicated trial manager were all more likely to\nhave been funded by the MRC (p < 0.001 for all\nassociations).\nTwo separate approaches to the analysis of\nrecruitment success were undertaken. First, only\ntrials that recruited to their original target were\ndeemed to have recruited successfully. Thirty-eight\ntrials (31%) were assessed to have recruited\nsuccessfully under this definition. It was felt,\nhowever, that this definition might be overly harsh\nto trials that almost achieved their recruitment\ntarget, and therefore all analyses were rerun using\nthe definition of success as having achieved at\nleast 80% of original recruitment target. Under\nthis definition, 68 (55%) trials were deemed to\nhave recruited \u2018successfully\u2019. Findings in respect of\nfeatures associated with success (Table 12) were\nconsistent under the two definitions of recruitment\nsuccess.\nUnder either definition, however, it is clear that\nsuccessful recruitment to trials is a problem. Even\nunder the generous definition of success, only half\nof the trials in this study population were deemed\nto have recruited successfully and the situation\ndoes not seem to have improved over time (see\nFigure 1). This is despite the growing literature\nsummarising barriers and facilitators to\nrecruitment published in the 1990s (exemplified\nby the HTA review by Prescott and colleagues5).\nChanges in the external environment common to\nall trials are likely to have contributed. Some\ntrialists undoubtedly experienced delays around\nthe time of the introduction of the MREC system\nin 1997.22 The climate for research was also\naltered by events such as the Bristol inquiry into\npaediatric surgery. The proportion of trials failing\nto achieve even 80% successful recruitment was\nhighest in the late 1990s, contemporaneous with\nthe height of the perceived problems with these\nissues. These sorts of changes could have\naccounted in part for the reduced recruitment\nsuccess between 1997 and 1999.\nThe overall start to recruitment was found to have\nbeen delayed in 40% of trials. The primary\nreasons listed for this were associated with staffing\nproblems. Research ethics approval delays and\nR&D issues did not appear to be a particularly\ncommon reason for delays given in reports to the\nfunders, which was somewhat surprising given the\nweight attributed to these factors anecdotally.23\nWhile staffing issues were seen as particularly\nproblematic for specific trials, it was apparent that\na wide spectrum of problems was encountered\n(reflected by the high level of \u2018other\u2019 reasons).\nAs indicated above, there was evidence that cancer\ntrials were associated with better rates of successful\nrecruitment compared with non-cancer trials.\nWithin the field of cancer, there has been a long-\nstanding interest in the recruitment of patients into\nclinical trials.24 This relatively positive and open\nenvironment for the recruitment of patients into\ntrials culminated recently in the establishment of\nthe National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) in\nEngland and Wales, which was created to improve\nthe infrastructure within the NHS for clinical\nresearch in cancer and to ensure that research is\nbetter integrated with cancer care. The NCRN was\nestablished by the Department of Health in April\n2001 to support prospective trials of cancer\ntreatments and to support research undertaken by\ncancer charities (most of the trials included in this\nstudy had completed recruitment before this\ninitiative was established). The aim of the NCRN is\nto improve the speed, quality and integration of\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n17\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.research, ultimately resulting in improved patient\ncare. It hopes to increase involvement and\nrecruitment into trials through the creation of\ncancer research networks across the UK closely\naligned to cancer service networks. Within the\nNCRN all trials are conducted through accredited\ntrials units and recruitment is coordinated through\nfunded locally based research staff. This process of\ntrials unit accreditation ensures that all of the core\ncompetencies (e.g. trial management,\nprogramming, statistics) are available at the\ncoordinating centre, thus minimising the potential\nfor trial managers to be isolated (see below),\nensuring experience across the entire trial team and\nmaximising the efficiency of the trial processes.25\nThis approach has resulted in a doubling of the\nrecruitment rate to cancer trials since its\ninception.26 This approach to centralised trial\ncoordination is currently being expanded across the\nnewly formed UK Clinical Research Network, which\naims to coordinate recruitment to clinical research\n(initially in six clinical areas) across the UK.\nThe perception that drug trials may be easier to\nrecruit to than non-drug trials is perhaps not\nsurprising given the background of rigour\nrequired by registration agencies and the\nmethodological problems associated with non-\ndrug trials. In surgery, for example, the problems\nwith conducting randomised trials have been well\ndocumented.27 With non-drug interventions, such\nas cognitive behaviour therapy and other\noperator\/therapist-dependent interventions, there\nis the additional problem of therapist recruitment\nand retention over and above patient recruitment.\nCommentators have also indicated that trials that\ninclude innovative operator or therapist-\ndependent interventions suffer particularly from\ntiming issues, where there may be only a very\nnarrow window of time when a trial can be\nsuccessfully mounted. This has been encapsulated\nin what has become known as Buxton\u2019s law, where\n\u201cit is always too early (to evaluate an intervention),\nuntil unfortunately it\u2019s suddenly too late!\u201d28 Trials\nthat attempt to evaluate new non-drug\ntechnologies also suffer from other problems, most\nnotably the handling of the \u2018learning curve\u2019 of\noperators\/therapists within the study, and trialists\nhave often sought to restrict the involvement of\npractitioners to only those most experienced in\nthe technique.29 By restricting the number of\npractitioners available to be included in the trials,\nthis has in turn restricted the eligible number of\ncentres, and thus the patient pool available for\nstudy. New approaches to the statistical assessment\nof the learning curve should help to address this\nproblem in the future.\nThe view that trials that had a dedicated trial\nmanager would be associated with better rates of\nrecruitment compared with those that did not was\ngiven some empirical support. In its recent review\nof clinical trials, the MRC acknowledged that the\nfailure of some trials can be due to practical\nproblems with trial management rather than\nscientific problems or problems with the trial\ndesign.4 This had been recognised by the Council\nsome years earlier and, in response to the desire\nto maximise the dissemination of good practice\nacross trials, they set up a network of those people\nresponsible for the day-to-day management of\nMRC-funded trials, known as the MRC Trial\nManagers Network. The primary functions of the\nnetwork were to link trial managers together to\nensure the dissemination of expertise and\nexperience, and to establish a programme of\ntraining and support for its members. The\nnetwork, which has recently expanded to include\ntrial managers from the HTA Programme and\nother publicly funded trials (and renamed the UK\nTrial Managers Network), aims to facilitate the\ndevelopment of a well-trained, highly motivated,\neffective workforce of trial managers within the\nUK healthcare system who will make an important\ncontribution to the efficient delivery of high-\nquality clinical trials. It also aims to establish a\nforum to promote best practice in clinical trials,\nand provide a focus for the development of skills\nand expertise of trial managers as part of the\nlarger national clinical trial network. Through the\npromotion of this type of activity, one might hope\nthat the standards of recruitment will increase over\nthe coming years.\nConclusions\nLarge numbers of publicly funded trials have\nexperienced recruitment problems in recent years.\nMany have had extended recruitment periods,\nwhich have often been supported by additional\nfunds. Patterns of delay were shown to vary. Many\npossible reasons were suggested, and a range of\nstrategies was adopted in an attempt to improve\nrecruitment. The simple descriptive analyses\npresented in this chapter do not give any \nclear indications of factors that are likely to\npredispose to successful recruitment. The\nexplanation of why some trials consistently recruit\nwell and others do not would appear to be\ncomplex, and not amenable to analyses of this\ntype. Therefore, one has to look to the results \nof the other more in-depth components of the\nstudy for more reliable insights into the reasons\nfor this.\nAn epidemiological review of a cohort of trials funded by the MRC and the NHS HTA programme \n18Introduction\nMany research papers start with the statement that\nRCTs are considered to be the gold-standard\nmethod for the assessment of the effectiveness of\ninterventions. Trials are not, however, simply an\nexperimental tool, independent of social, political\nand moral values. They are complex and dynamic\nentities, shaped by disparate internal and external\nforces. The conduct and progress of trials can, for\ninstance, be shaped by some of their own\ncharacteristics, such as the impact of the use of\nplacebo on recruitment,30,31 the necessity for\ncertain levels of expertise required to carry out\ntrial interventions13 and the involvement of a\nheavy data collection load for local centres.32,33\nThey can also be affected by pre-existing factors\nsuch as the beliefs of the collaborating clinicians34\nand patient preferences.35,36 Several such factors\nhave been reported as barriers to recruitment by\ntrialists37,38 and identified in empirical\nstudies.15,39,40\nThese forces create a complex microclimate in\nwhich a trial can flourish, struggle, or do both. In\nspite of the likely impact of this microclimate on\nthe progress of an individual trial, research has\noften focused on questions raised by trials more\ngenerally, treating those with some common\nfactors as a collective (e.g. in oncology32,41\u201343 or in\nneonatology44). While this type of research is\nuseful for mapping out broad areas of concern,\nthe particular circumstances in which an\nindividual trial operates, which may be crucial in\npromoting or inhibiting the successful working of\nthe research, cannot be considered where trials are\ntreated as a collective.\nThere is, however, a developing body of literature\nthat uses a variety of methods, which examines the\nworkings of individual trials and strives to\nunderstand their specific contexts. A number of\nsingle trials assesses the impact of attitudinal\nfactors for a single trial.45\u201347 There are several\nreports by trialists that describe their experience\nof recruitment in their own trials.48\u201350 Gillan and\ncolleagues23 unusually describe the impact of\nexternal forces such as \u201cnational clinical, economic\nand political factors\u201d on recruitment to two\nmulticentre trials. \nThese publications are pointers to a potentially\nfruitful area for research. It is the present authors\u2019\ncontention that a careful empirical exploration of\nthe factors that shape a number of individual\ntrials, to consider their unique challenges and the\nresponses of their research teams to those\nchallenges, could afford important insights that\nare likely to be to the benefit of those developing\nother trials. It is argued that an assessment of \nthe microclimate will promote greater\nunderstanding of the complexity of factors\ninvolved in progress in trials, and greater\nsensitivity to the importance of the interplay of\nsuch factors. It will also afford the opportunity to\nmake comparisons between trials from a more\ninformed position, to look for common ground\neven where the trials may be rather different. Any\ncommon factors in progress highlighted in this\nway are likely to be more instructive than those\nidentified either from one trial or from an\nundifferentiated collective.\nIt is also suggested here that a search for \ncommon factors in the success of quite disparate\ntrials that might be considered to be \u2018exemplars\u2019\n(see the next page for a definition) is a positive\napproach that is largely missing from the available\nliterature. Studies that have examined the\nperformance of trials have mainly concentrated on\nsituations where there are problems in order to\nunderstand or explain why things have gone\nwrong.34,49,51\u201353 The present study therefore\nconcentrates on trials that have, by and large,\nrecruited well and so could be defined as\nsuccessful. It is possible that a search for common\nfactors in quite disparate exemplar trials may\nprovide constructive data that could be used to\nguide and shape the development of further\nresearch.\nIn summary, this chapter is grounded in a drive to\nunderstand the influence of highly complicated\nmicroclimates on the success of a small number of\nexemplar trials and of the impact of any features\nthat they may have in common, in spite of their\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n19\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Unlike a number of papers\nin the literature, it is carried out from an\nindependent outsider perspective.\nAims\nPart A of STEPS used reported information \nto give insights into features of trials and the\nstrategies that they involved. Part B builds on this,\nbut works with the concept that different parties\nwho are internal to the trials will be able to offer\nadditional role-specific and location-specific\ninsights that are not available in these official\naccounts. By interviewing individuals with\ndifferent internal perspectives, the possibility of\nproducing more sensitive data is increased.\nNurses, for instance, may be privy to patient\nreactions to the offer of trial enrolment that are\nunavailable to more senior doctors. Different\nlevels of exposure may shape their views, and so\ntheir practices, within the research context. Trial\nmanagers may describe intended modes of\noperation, and local collaborators may explain\nwhy those procedures do or do not work well in\ntheir local circumstances. The aim is not to\npresent a detailed analysis or a comparison of\nthese different viewpoints. Instead, the variety of\ninterviewee perspectives is used to produce a\nmultivoiced, more detailed and more nuanced\naccount of each trial.\nThe aims of Part B of STEPS are to use these \ndata to describe the characteristics of individual\n\u2018exemplar\u2019 trials, in addition to information\navailable from protocols, trial materials and\nthrough the reports of those closely involved \nwith the running of the trials. Analysis of the\ninterview data enables the exploration of the\nunique circumstances potentially relevant to\nrecruitment for each trial. This element of the\nresearch aims to understand, through the opinions\nof the interviewees, how recruitment may be\naffected in a very broad sense, and so focuses on\ntheir progress, any challenges that arose and any\nadaptations that were made. Finally, the data were\nused to compare the trials in order to highlight\ncommon factors potentially relevant to\nrecruitment.\nThe four Part B trials were chosen to represent a\nvariety of clinical situations, each with its own\nparticular challenges. As previously stated, it is\nprecisely this variety that is of interest. Although it\nis not possible here to prove exactly which\ncommon factors did promote recruitment (as\nopposed to the perception that they did so), it is\npossible to use the informed testimonies of those\nclosely connected to the trials to generate likely\nfactors that may be considered empirically. \nMaterials and methods\nThe trials\nDefinition of \u2018exemplars\u2019\nIt was intended that an examination of trials that\nhave recruited well would produce innovative and\npositive data. The initial challenge for the\nresearch team was to develop and refine a\ndefinition of the type of trials that should be the\nsubject of the study. The use of the term \u2018exemplar\ntrials\u2019 arose during a STEPS meeting. Although an\nexemplar can be taken to mean something that is\ntypical or representative (an example), it can also\nrefer to something that is worthy of imitation (a\nmodel). It is in the latter sense that this term is\nemployed here. \nWhat in practice constitutes exemplar trials was\nnot, however, immediately clear. Initially it was\nconsidered that in keeping with Part A, these trials\nshould have recruited to their initial target.\nFurthermore, it was felt that they should have\nreached this target in the time-frame initially\nspecified. Given the emerging findings from Part\nA, however, it became clear that such a rigid\ndefinition would be problematic. Therefore, trials\nwere considered that had met or were on schedule\nto meet targets agreed with their funders (MRC\nand HTA Programme) and, most importantly, that\nthe funders considered to be successful. If the\nfunders of the trials categorised, and in some cases\npublicised, the trials as a success or as an example\nfor other trials, then for the present purposes they\ncould be viewed as exemplars.\nAccess to the Part B trials\nThe funders were asked to recommend a number\nof trials that they considered to be successful. Four\ntrials were selected, two from each funder, and the\nPIs were approached to assess their interest in\nparticipation in STEPS. The PI for one trial\noriginally selected declined because of the trial\nteam\u2019s plans to publish details of their recruitment\nstrategies at some point in the future. A further\ntrial from the same funder was chosen as a\nreplacement. \nDescriptions of the trials\nFor simplicity, the trials selected (FOCUS,\nTOuCAN, HPS and ELEVATE) are often referred\nto in this chapter as \u2018the Part B trials\u2019.

Two\nare hospital based (FOCUS and HPS), one\ninvolved a comparison of inpatients and\noutpatient services (TOuCAN) and another\nassessed primary care (ELEVATE). None of the\ntrials is a simple two-arm parallel group trial; they\nrange from a five-armed trial with cross-over\n(FOCUS), to a three-armed patient preference\ntrial (TOuCAN), a stratified trial (ELEVATE) and\na factorial trial (HPS). The clinical specialities\ninvolved are cardiovascular health promotion\n(HPS), oncology (FOCUS), adolescent psychiatry\nfor anorexia nervosa (TOuCAN) and asthma care\n(ELEVATE). All of the trials are multicentre. In\nthree of the four trials there are drug\ninterventions. One trial (HPS) involves the use of\nplacebo. The possible outcomes of the trial\ninterventions reflect the different settings and\npatient populations involved, with two of the trials\ninvolving assessment of mortality (HPS and\nFOCUS). In two cases (HPS and FOCUS), the\ntrials are managed by large clinical trials units, in\none by an academic unit (ELEVATE) and in\nanother, management is shared by two branches of\na regional service (TOuCAN). The absolute\nsample sizes for the trials may be less relevant\nthan the fact that in each case the trials were\nintended to be the largest in the world for their\npopulation. All of the trials involved an extended\nperiod of recruitment, of which one required a\ntime-only extension (HPS) and two required\nadditional funding (ELEVATE and TOuCAN).\nTarget sample sizes were revised for the TOuCAN\nStudy. Recruitment is complete and the planned\nnumbers are exceeded for two trials (HPS and\nFOCUS), and recruitment is ongoing for the other\ntwo with targets likely to be achieved.\nAccess to interviewees\nRECs and trust R&D requirements\nAt the time of the original application to fund\nSTEPS, REC approval for interviews with NHS\nstaff was not normally required. However, new\nregulations were instituted and it became\nnecessary to submit a full REC application for this\ncomponent of the research. As MREC approval\nunder \u2018no local researcher guidelines\u2019 was given,\nthere was no need for applications to LRECs, but\nthe new research governance guidance, also\ninstituted since the start of STEPS, caused further\ndelays. The study was not viewed uniformly by the\nR&D staff. The researcher consulted with 12 R&D\noffices and was advised to make applications in\neach instance to conform to local requirements.\nWhile some centres had rigorous requirements,\nincluding applications for honorary contracts,\nprovision of references, completion of\noccupational health forms and a police check\n(requested, but later waived after some discussion\non receipt of the study paperwork), three R&D\noffices revised their opinion that an application\nwas necessary. The formal process of negotiating\nethical and R&D approval took a disproportionate\namount of researcher time for this short study, and\nhas negative implications for conducting such\nresearch in future.\nRecruitment of interviewees\nBefore the start of interviews, a broad model of\nthe likely candidates for interview was drawn up,\nreflecting the researchers\u2019 concept of the relevant\nprotagonists in the running of clinical trials. It was\nconsidered important to include those with a\nrange of roles, not to characterise the views of\ndifferent professional groups, but on the\nassumption that those with different\nresponsibilities and experiences will have different\ninsights into the four trials. There is little research\nthat assesses the views of such various\ncontributors. Although there are some reports of\nthe views of nurses54,55 and some of the views of\nGP recruiters,37,56\u201358 the research samples available\nare largely comprised of senior doctors involved in\ntrials, with a strong bias towards oncology\ntrials.32,41\u201343,45,59,60\u201362 No research was identified\nthat describes the attitudes of coordinating staff\n[although see Rico-Villademoros and colleagues63\nfor a survey-based description of the role of the\nclinical research coordinator (data manager) in\noncology trials].\nThe original aim was to carry out 32 interviews,\neight per trial, with a split between the central\ncoordinating staff and the staff from the recruiting\ncentres. The sample was constructed to represent\nkey players who could describe the workings of\neach of the trials. The intended interviewees were\nPIs, trial managers, local lead consultants and\nlocal recruiters (doctors or nurses according to the\ntrial procedures). As understanding of the\nprocesses involved in each trial increased, the list\nof likely interviewees was expanded to fit the\nunique circumstances of that trial. For the\nELEVATE trial it became clear that there were\nboth research assistants and agency-employed\nresearch nurses with key roles in recruitment who\ncould not be omitted from the study. For two of\nthe trials there were two joint PIs. For the\nTOuCAN study there was no research nurse\ninvolvement in the trial and recruitment was\ncarried out by non-clinical trial staff who had not\nbeen included in the original list of interviewees.\nUltimately there were 45 interviews in total\n(Table 15). \nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n24The respondents were recruited from the four\ntrials with a combination of purposive selection\nmethods, and elements of snowball sampling.\nAccess to the PIs was facilitated by the funders.\nThe PIs in turn facilitated access to the central\ntrial team. For the local centres, letters\n(Appendix 4) including information sheets\ndescribing the research (Appendix 5) and consent\nforms (Appendix 6) were sent out directly by the\ntrial teams either by e-mail or by post to the trial\nmailing lists. Those interested in taking part in the\nresearch were invited to respond by replying to the\nresearcher rather than to the trial team, thus\nmaintaining a degree of confidentiality for those\nrespondents in relation to the central trial team.\nWhere more people responded than were needed,\ninterviewees were selected randomly. On some\noccasions, individuals advised the researcher that\nit would be appropriate to speak to a colleague. In\nthese instances the informant was asked either to\nmake contact on behalf of the study, or to check\nwith their colleague that they were happy for the\nresearcher to make direct contact. In a small\nnumber of cases the researcher made an\nunmediated direct approach to individuals who\nwere detailed in the trials literature who seemed to\nbe potentially important to the study. It is not\npossible to give a response rate as it is not known\nhow many individuals were contacted initially.\nTable 15 shows the broad division of interviews\nbetween central coordinating staff (N = 21) and\nclinical staff in recruiting or referring centres \n(N = 24). These two categories do not, however,\nreflect a simple split between recruiters and non-\nrecruiters. Recruitment was not carried out\nexclusively by the staff in the recruiting centres,\nand within the recruiting centres not all staff had a\nrole in recruitment. In the FOCUS trial the PI had\na clinical caseload from which trial participants\ncan be recruited, and for ELEVATE and TOuCAN\nthere were members of the central office team who\nhad specific duties to recruit to the trial. In the\nrecruiting centres there were some staff whose role\nwas to facilitate rather than to carry out\nrecruitment. The distribution of recruiters\n(N = 16) and non-recruiters (N = 29) is also\nindicated in Table 15, with recruiters marked with\nthe heaviest highlighting.\nInterview structure\nAll interviews were carried out by telephone in the\nperiod from December 2003 to May 2004. They\nwere tape-recorded with the consent of the\ninterviewees and fully transcribed. The discussions\ntypically took between 20 and 80 minutes,\ndepending on respondents\u2019 degree of involvement\nin a trial. The interviews were semi-structured and\nexplored respondents\u2019 opinions about the Part B\ntrial in which they were involved (Appendices 7\nand 8). The interviews did not include discussion\nof individual patients. They were wide ranging,\nhighlighting individual responsibilities and their\nattitudes to and experiences of the trials.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n25\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

When, at the end of the\ninterviews, respondents were asked to identify key\nfactors in the success of their trial, and if there\nwere any issues that were important and had not\nbeen discussed, the researchers were confident\nthat their accounts and their final summaries were\nwell considered and reliable. Because the study\ninvolved professionals with a variety of roles within\nthe trials, the questions were to some extent varied\nfor each of these individuals. The lines of\nquestioning were also modified and developed\nover the period of the fieldwork, in response to\nthe insights gained.\nAnalysis\nAll of the interviews were conducted, read and\nanalysed by one of the researchers for Part B (CS),\nwith research colleagues (JG and DE) reading a\nsample of the interview transcripts and\ncommenting on significant portions of data as\nrequested. Data analysis was conducted with the\nassistance of the qualitative package Atlas-ti. The\nanalysis was shaped by the research aims to\nprovide descriptive, exploratory and comparative\ndata.\nTo some extent, the data are a product of the\nquestions that were asked and could be said to be\ninfluenced by the research team\u2019s pre-existing\nperception of what was likely to be important\nrather than pure themes that arose from the data.\nHowever, many issues arose in response to the\ndirection of the interviewees, and the organisation\nand refinement of the data are very much a result\nof the analysis. In his \u2018adaptive theory\u2019, Layder64\nvalues the role of pre-existing researcher\nknowledge and concepts, in comparison to\ngrounded theory approaches in which the data\ncollected are primary and from which themes are\nsaid to emerge. He suggests an approach to\nanalysis in which existing models are adapted in a\nprocess of modification and refinement as\nexperience and understanding of a phenomenon\ngrow. In this way, for Part B, an initial line of\nquestioning was drawn up for the interview\nschedule; it was developed in interview as\ninteresting lines of information were introduced by\nrespondents, and then explored in analysis.\nAnalysis commenced with codes based on a\nmixture of the interview schedule and insights\ngained from the interviewer\u2019s experience of the\ninterviews. The codes were expanded and\ncollapsed as each interview was processed.\nEventually no new codes were introduced and the\nresearcher was satisfied that the data had been\nadequately explored. \nThe findings from the descriptive, exploratory and\ncomparative data are presented in three parts.\nThey are first organised as four case studies in\nwhich the structure, history and progress of each\ntrial is described. The data are then presented as\nkey chronological stages in the development and\nconduct of the trials, ordered thematically within\nand across the four trials. Finally, possible\ncommon factors in recruitment success, as\nsuggested by the interviewees, and generated by\nthe data analysis, are presented.\nWhere appropriate, quotations are attributed to\nparticular trials and \u2018type\u2019 of respondent.\nHowever, in some instances, no attribution is\ngiven, to protect anonymity.\nResults\nBrief histories of individual \u2018exemplar\u2019\ntrials\nThe FOCUS trial\nThe FOCUS trial was developed to address the\nissue of how best to treat patients with advanced\nmetastatic colorectal cancer, in the light of the\ndevelopment of two drugs, irinotecan and\noxaliplatin. These drugs were evaluated in\nprevious trials but had not been directly\ncompared, nor had there been direct comparison\nof the same drug used in first- or second-line\ntherapy. \nThe developmental period for this trial was\nlengthy, in part because of a process of clinical and\nacademic consultation with colleagues and\nprofessional bodies. Negotiations with industry for\naccess to, and funding for, the study drugs were\nprotracted and added to the delays in set-up. A\npotential consequence of such delays was a shift in\nthe evidence base, which would disrupt the trial at\na later stage.\nIn 2002 the National Institute for Health and\nClinical Excellence (NICE) argued that existing\nand emerging data on the improvements in\nsurvival times for the drugs used in the FOCUS\ntrial did not warrant the costs involved with their\nroutine use in first-line therapy, and issued\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n26guidelines which largely limited off-protocol access\nto the drugs.65 NICE recommended that\nirinotecan should be used, but only after the\nfailure of a first-line treatment, and that the use of\noxaliplatin be restricted to a small subcategory of\npatients. There were two consequences of the\nguidelines. First, except for that subgroup,\noxaliplatin was now available only via the trial, to\nwhich NICE recommended recruitment. Second,\nNICE had recommended the use of second-line\nirinotecan when first-line treatments had failed,\nwhen two of the arms in the trial did not employ\nirinotecan. The NICE guidance caused a furore in\nthe oncology community, with some oncologists\narguing in a letter to a newspaper66 that NICE\nhad misinterpreted the available data. \nAfter another period of consultation with the\nprofessionals involved in the trial, the trial team\nadapted by amending the protocol to remove the\nexisting discouragement to post-trial cross-over\nand introducing a balanced cross-over policy. All\nsurviving trial patients would then have equal\naccess to either oxaliplatin or irinotecan\ndepending on the trial arm, after completing their\ninitial trial treatment. In response to public debate\nfollowing NICE guidance, the independent trial\nsteering committee (TSC) took the unusual step of\npublishing a letter defending the trial\nmanagement group\u2019s decision to continue accrual. \nThe letter67 included a statement that the data\nmonitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) had\nreported no safety or ethical reasons to close the\ntrial, and also included current overall median\nsurvival data for the trial as a whole. The aim was\nto assuage concerns that patients were being\ndeprived of the opportunity of improved survival.\nThe recruitment rate remained steady in this\nperiod. \nThe trial exceeded its aim to recruit\napproximately 2100 patients, accruing 2135\npatients, but over 3.5 years rather than the\nplanned 3-year period.\nThe ELEVATE trial\nThe ELEVATE trial was developed in response to\na call for applications by the HTA Programme. It\ncompares the role and cost of a relatively new class\nof orally administered drugs, LTRAs, to ICS and\nLABs (see Table 14) for primary care patients who\nhave asthma that requires regular preventive\ntreatment or an increase in therapy. LTRAs have\nbeen available for around 7 years and can be\nprescribed for asthma patients, but more often\nLABs are used. Although LTRAs are more\nexpensive than conventional drugs, they are in\ntablet form and may prove to be more acceptable\nthan inhalers, so promoting better disease control. \nThe ELEVATE trial is framed by the five \u2018steps\u2019 of\nthe British Thoracic Society National Asthma\nGuidelines. Eligible patients are those judged\neither to have progressed in their condition or to\nhave poor control of their symptoms and so need\nan increase in their medication: they need to be\n\u2018stepped up\u2019. As the trial is pragmatic, aiming to\nproduce \u2018real-life data\u2019, it includes patients who\nwould be traditionally excluded from asthma trials,\nsuch as smokers or those affected by other\nconditions. \nThe trial was very much shaped by its location in\ngeneral practice. Trials in this area are known to\nbe difficult.47,58,68 There was, however, an\nimportant advantage for the trial in that GP\ncontracts require that a high proportion of\npatients with asthma are regularly reviewed, and\nthat poor control of asthma is addressed.\nParticipation in the ELEVATE trial offered\npractices a valuable degree of support with this\npotentially onerous task.\nRecruitment was initially very slow. The trial team\nhad expected to provide some administrative\nsupport to the practices, but it became clear that\nmuch greater involvement in the recruitment\nprocess was required. The entire approach to\nrecruitment was revised. Funds were granted by\nthe HTA Programme to provide a more intensive\nlevel of assistance and additional staff costs, and to\npermit an extension to the recruitment period.\nMoney from a pharmaceutical company supported\nbaseline practice audits and excess drug costs. At\nthe time of this research (July 2004), recruitment\nto one stratum is complete and is ongoing for the\nremaining stratum. A reduction in the length of\nfollow-up for this stratum has enabled the\nrecruitment period to be further extended without\nan additional extension of the amount or period\nof the funding.\nThe TOuCAN study\nFor some time the senior researchers for the\nTOuCAN study had wished to carry out a trial\nassessing the efficacy of approaches to care for\nadolescents with anorexia nervosa. They were keen\nto understand whether it was better to have\nintensive inpatient treatment at an earlier stage in\nthe condition, or whether this should be reserved\nfor the more difficult, entrenched cases. They also\nwished to assess the possible value of a recently\ndeveloped specialist outpatient service. RCTs are\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n27\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.not widely used for this condition and previous\nattempts to bring about a trial had been\nunsuccessful. There were many practical and\nattitudinal obstacles to be overcome to set up the\nTOuCAN study. In a setting where there are\ndeeply held lay and professional beliefs about\napproaches to treatment, the researchers had to\nwork hard to meet colleagues\u2019 concerns and to\npromote support for the development of a trial.\nOnce funds were awarded there were several\npractical and attitudinal obstacles to be addressed.\nThese were a highly complicated mix of local\nconcerns over responsibilities for patients, about\ndelivery of care and about the impact of the trial\nupon professional standards and autonomy.\nDespite this rather difficult climate, the trial did\ngain the support needed. In addition to the efforts\nmade by the central team to maintain the profile\nof the trial and to gain access to potential\nparticipants, an important element in securing\nprofessional support seems to have been the\nopportunity for hard-pressed clinicians to access\nexpert assistance with an often intractable, time-\nconsuming and anxiety-provoking condition.\nSome clinicians were uncomfortable with passing\nover control of their patients in the trial context,\nbut others welcomed the opportunity to free up\nlocal time and resources.\nIt became clear that although a very impressive\n90% of cases were entered into either the trial\narms or the naturalistic arm, the recruitment\ntargets of 210 in the RCT and 70 in the\nnaturalistic arm were not going to be met. With\nnew power calculations the targets were revised to\n165 and 75, respectively, and a funded extension\nwas awarded. These targets were reached in\n3.5 years instead of 2 years.\nThe MRC\/BHF Heart Protection Study\nThe HPS was based at the Clinical Trial Service\nUnit (CTSU) in Oxford. It aimed to evaluate\ncholesterol-lowering therapy (statins) and\nantioxidant vitamins for a diverse group of\npatients at increased risk of coronary heart disease\n(previous coronary disease, other occlusive arterial\ndisease, diabetes, hypertension). The trial grew\nout of a pilot study which was funded by industrial\nsponsors and started recruitment in 1987. As a\nresult of this work the trial team concluded that a\nmuch larger and more ambitious trial was needed\nthan had been previously anticipated. There were\nquestions about the role and safety of statins, in\nparticular whether they would reduce mortality\nand morbidity even in those with cholesterol levels\nthat were below average for the UK population. In\naddition it was considered important to explore\nthe impact of dietary supplementation with\nantioxidant vitamins. At that time they were\nthought to have a potential role in protecting the\nbody from the adverse effects of high cholesterol.\nWith the initial sponsors unwilling to fund such a\ntrial, it was necessary to bring together a\nconsortium of funders. The trial eventually cost\n\u00a321 million and was funded by the MRC, the\nBritish Heart Foundation (BHF) and two\npharmaceutical companies who manufactured the\nstatins and the vitamins. Securing this degree of\nfunding, while maintaining academic\nindependence and control of the research\nquestions, was hugely difficult and time\nconsuming, and the main trial suffered major\ndelays as a consequence, finally starting\nrecruitment in 1994. The delay may have led to a\ndilution in the difference in cholesterol levels\nbetween the statin arm and non-statin arms as\nclinicians increasingly prescribed statins as results\nfrom other studies became available during the\ncourse of the HPS.\nThe trial was randomised and double-blind, and\nused a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design; around 5000 people\nwere allocated to each of four treatments: \n(1) active statin and active vitamins, (2) active\nstatin and placebo vitamins, (3) placebo statin and\nactive vitamins, and (4) placebo statin and placebo\nvitamins.\nThe trial was thought to be well timed in terms of\nclinical awareness of the need for an answer to\nimportant questions about management of\ncholesterol, but the feature that shaped the\nprogress of this trial was its size. Many\nmanagement issues were focused on how best to\ncontrol and direct human and other resources. For\ninstance, 69 UK hospitals participated in the trial.\nIn all, 131,000 invitations were issued and 63,603\npeople between the ages of 40 and 80 years were\nscreened. Of these 32,145 agreed to enter the \n2-month run-in to the study and 20,536 finally\ntook part (15,454 men and 5082 women). Loss to\nfollow-up was less than 1%. Identification of\npotential participants was carried out by the\ncentral trial coordinating team and this was\nrecognised as critical to the success of the study;\nlocal consultants and research nurses would simply\nnot have had the time to do this. It also allowed\nthe central trial team to target categories of\npatients whose participation they wanted to\nincrease, such as women and older patients. Study\nclinics in the hospitals were run by specially\nrecruited senior nurses and participants attended\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n28these clinics regularly over their 5-year period in\nthe trial. The nurses were trained centrally and\ngiven considerable autonomy.\nThe trial succeeded in its aim to recruit around\n20,000 patients between the ages of 40 and\n80 years over the period 1994\u20131997 and has\nreported its results.69\u201371 HPS gives STEPS an\nexample of a successful, large, \u2018simple\u2019 or\n\u2018streamlined\u2019 clinical trial with important,\ninternationally significant results. \nExploration of the key stages of the\ntrials processes\nAs these descriptions of the trials suggest, there is\na number of phases in the course of trials, each\ninvolving different challenges that the trial teams\nhave had to address. It would seem that it is\nimportant to consider how these different stages\ncontribute to the level of recruitment to a trial.\nFour key stages of the trials that may affect\nrecruitment were identified through the analysis.\nThey are:\n\u25cf key stage 1: Foundation work (engagement of\ncollaborators; establishing\nscientific rigour; funding and\nfinancial considerations)\n\u25cf key stage 2: Recruitment processes\n\u25cf key stage 3: Delivery of care\n\u25cf key stage 4: Delivery of research.\nThese stages are analytical constructs, rather than\nchronological stages, and involve a certain degree\nof overlap.\nKey stage 1: Foundation work: engagement of\ncollaborators\nTrials take place in clinical settings in which the\nprofessionals involved are autonomous or can act\nwithin a firmly integrated community. Within the\nbroader clinical communities, a research\ncommunity can be more, or less, well developed at\nthe start of a trial. Even where research is carried\nout, it may or may not involve RCTs. The\ninterviews with the PIs and some of the staff who\nhad been associated with the early stages of the\nPart B trials involved discussion of the preparatory\nor foundation work that they carried out to\nenthuse and engage their community in their\nresearch, and to maximise the support of potential\ncollaborators. \nThe professionals on whom they depended had\nvarying degrees of research experience and\nenthusiasm for the trials. For the TOuCAN study\n(anorexia nervosa) and the ELEVATE trial\n(asthma), there were limited pre-existing clinical\nnetworks in which some individuals had been\nassociated with earlier research collaborations, but\nthere was work to be done in bringing the wider\ncommunity together as a collective with a\ncommitted research identity. The HPS\ncardiovascular and the FOCUS trial (colorectal\ncancer) were, by contrast, conducted in the context\nof rolling programmes of trials, where professionals\nwere familiar with trial rationale and procedures\nand in which there were established networks of\nresearch collaboration. Some of the \u201cwork behind\nthe scenes\u201d (TOuCAN study interviewee) described\nin the interviews was to establish the clinical and\nscientific basis of the trials and was carried out\nbefore funds were awarded, and some took place in\nthe early postfunding stage. Typically, it involved\nsenior professionals in the field. How the trials\nwere received appeared to be very much a product\nof the degree of research experience held by these\ncommunities.\nThe TOuCAN study drew on the support of what\nwas described as the \u201csmall world\u201d of adolescent\npsychiatry in the north-west of England and was\ncarried out by a newly developed research team.\nFrom the start there was a number of major\nobstacles to overcome in order to bring about this\n\u201cdifficult\u201d, \u201cmammoth trial\u201d, but one of the\ninterviewees described how they felt that it offered\nan important chance to develop the research\nexperience and profile of their community:\nAdult mental health services hadn\u2019t been very\nsuccessful in treatment trials in this area and here was\nan opportunity for child psychiatry, [which is] a bit of\na Cinderella speciality, to come up with some good\nresearch.\nAlthough there are academic units in the area, and\nsome interviewees who were linked to these\ndescribed themselves as \u201cpro-research\u201d and \u201cvery\nresearch orientated\u201d, the image generated by the\nTOuCAN study interviewees was a community that\nwas not naturally drawn to RCT methods. RCTs\nare seldom used in connection with anorexia\nnervosa and so there was not widespread\nexperience with trials. One interviewee stated that\n\u201cup here it\u2019s unusual for people to be in treatment\ntrials\u201d and another felt that the trial focus on the\ncare of children and adolescents further\ncomplicated things:\nChild psychiatry is a very young branch [so there is\nnot as much research] as you have in other branches\nof medicine. There are [also] some people who don\u2019t\nbelieve in quantitative research. In psychiatry there is\nmuch more [support] for qualitative research.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n29\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.There were, however, concerns about the\nTOuCAN study that went beyond research\nmethods and these constituted a major challenge\nto establishing the trial. There were concerns\nabout limitations on professional autonomy and\nerosion of skills in a system where cases of\nanorexia nervosa are randomised away from local\ncare. Although the primary aim was to delineate\nappropriate services, the way in which inpatient\nand outpatient care was used within the trial\ncaused much professional anxiety. Inpatient care\ninvolves removal of anorexic adolescents from\nhome, school and family to a difficult environment\nand exposure to a range of highly problematic\npsychiatric conditions. Although this approach is\ntraditionally reserved for urgent cases, it can still\nbe difficult to find inpatient beds. Randomisation\nmeant that patients in far less extreme\ncircumstances may be allocated to inpatient care,\nand that some in a more advanced condition be\nallocated to outpatient care. Although the trial was\npremised on uncertainty over the value of these\ndifferent approaches, some clinicians found it\ndifficult to countenance this situation. Some\nconcern was expressed in interviews that if urgent\ninpatient care was requested, beds could be\nblocked by \u201cmore robust\u201d trial patients.\nThese concerns highlight a major difficulty faced\nby the trial team. To answer the research questions\nnecessitated recruiting the vast majority of cases of\nadolescent anorexia nervosa in the area. To\nachieve this ambitious aim it was crucial that this\nclinical community, in which there was a\nsignificant degree of ambiguity over the proposed\nresearch, should work collectively and efficiently\ntowards that end. Although the interviews\nindicated that there are some enduring areas of\nunease, the trial has in fact been well supported.\nThis may have been due in part to the efforts\nmade by the trial team to address any community\nconcerns through meetings and provision of\ninformation, and it seems that some concerns may\nalso have been offset by the very localised setting\nfor the research. Although the PI had not\npreviously conducted a trial himself, he had\nworked in a number of key centres in the area, had\nestablished treatment programmes and had\nworked with many of the local senior adolescent\npsychiatrists. Along with other senior clinicians\ninvolved in the TOuCAN study, he was aware of\nlocal politics and sensitivities and was familiar with\nhis colleagues\u2019 concerns about a trial for this\ncondition. Most importantly, he had a clinical load\nand often took referrals of difficult cases from\nCAMHS colleagues in the area. He argued that\nthis active clinical position was crucial in terms of\nengendering trust and professional relationships.\nHe felt that a trial in such a setting would be\ndoomed to fail without the support of pre-existing\nclinical networks:\nIt would be difficult for an academic to propose this\nsort of trial without having the clinical standing. We\nhere are very embedded in the [local] clinical service,\nand so I think if an academic proposed the research\nand just hoped to get clinicians on board, they\nwouldn\u2019t be successful. I think you have to have\nreferrers\u2019 confidence that patients are going to be\nmanaged by somebody with expertise in the field.\nThe interviews with the local CAMHS\nprofessionals involved in the TOuCAN study\namply supported this statement. Despite some\ndifficulties, the interviewees were keen to\ncontribute to research in their area, and to\nsupport a colleague whom they either knew\npersonally or admired professionally. He was said\nto have \u201ca name\u201d in the field and interviewees said\nthat they were \u201cimpressed with what [he] was\ntrying to do\u201d, and that \u201ca lot of people would want\nto try and support the trial partly because of [the\nPI] being the one who\u2019s leading the trial\u201d. One of\nthe CAMHS professionals said: \u201cI felt favourable\ntowards the trial at the beginning because I know\n[the PI] and like him and because he had helped\nme to think about how to manage anorectics.\u201d\nSimilarly, the GPs interviewed in connection with\nthe ELEVATE trial of asthma therapy were aware\nof the work and profile of the PI and welcomed\nthe fact that he was himself a GP. His name was\nsaid to carry \u201ca huge amount [of weight]\u201d by one\nof the GPs. This was particularly important in this\nsetting as general practice is a hard-pressed area\nof medicine in which trials can be difficult for\npractical, methodological and ethical reasons.68\nThe ELEVATE trial was no exception to this and\nGPs who were interviewed talked about the need\nfor assurance that the research would not adversely\naffect their workload, their finances and their\npatients. The active presence of a GP as the PI, and\na process of consultation with a small GP research\nconsortium carried out to guide the development\nof the trial, had promoted an influential sense that\nthe trial had emerged from within primary care\nand so would be sensitive to its particular\npriorities and limitations. The interviewees who\nwere members of the consortium felt that they\nwere part of a research network and felt a degree\nof loyalty to the trial, even though it was not\nconsidered to be the easiest of research areas:\n[We were] very much involved in the design of it at\nthe beginning so we had a lot of ownership of the\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n30project and obviously we were going to be happy to\ngo ahead and recruit for it and very actively support\nit. \u2026 Had it been [anyone else as PI] I think we\nwouldn\u2019t have done it because we felt our asthma\npatients had already been approached three or four\ntimes in the last four years. But [we did] because we\u2019d\nbeen involved in this and we\u2019d thought things through\nand it\u2019s made as easy as possible for the practice.\nAlthough the ELEVATE trial drew some\nadvantages from the GP research consortium, it\nstill proved to be quite a task to pull together a\nsufficiently large group of practices to conduct the\ntrial. One GP explained some of the possible\nreasons why research that requires active GP input\ncan be problematic:\nThere is a very strong feeling among grass root GPs\nthat they don\u2019t see why they should do it themselves,\nin their time and why they should be [subsidising]\nit.\u2026 [It has to involve] questions that the GPs are\ninterested in and that are relevant to general practice\nand often research projects come up with questions\nthat actually seem particularly irrelevant. There\u2019s a\nslight suspicion of academia and research in general\npractice. A lot of people feel that you should be out\nthere on the front line seeing the patients and are\nvery sceptical about research in general.\nThe trial team ultimately had to extend the\ngeographical area for the trials, and to contact\nover 300 practices to find the 55 that went on to\nbecome recruiting centres.\nBy contrast, the remaining two trials were located\nwithin nationally based networks of experienced\nand convinced research collaborators. The HPS\nfollowed on from earlier trials and from a funded\npilot study. One of the consultants interviewed\nargued that his previous experience with the\nstandard of administration and the quality of trials\nrun by the CTSU was highly influential in his\ndecision to collaborate with HPS. Collaborators\nfrom the pilot study were available to the main\nstudy and additional centres were brought on\nboard through a process of visiting new centres\nand building up networks. The set-up period for\nthe 69 centres that went on to collaborate with the\ntrial proved to be \u201cmore time consuming\u201d than\nhad been anticipated. For the earlier collaborating\ncentres there was thought to be a pre-existing\n\u201ctrial ethos\u201d, but in some of the new centres there\nwere actually very few trials taking place. \nFor this trial a range of professional groups was\ntargeted as potential collaborators. Interest in the\nresearch was a more important factor than\nspeciality and so collaborators included, for\ninstance, neurologists, diabetologists and\nbiochemists, as well as cardiologists. The trial team\nwere very much aware of the need to promote a\nstrong sense of enthusiasm for the trial among\ntheir recruiting centres as their contact had to take\non a role as a local representative of the trial, and\nthe recruiting centres were required to act rather\nindependently from the central office (see below\nfor more details of recruitment):\n[It] was very important to establish that connection\nbecause with HPS, unlike some of the other trials we\ndo, \u2026 where we were getting data from the hospitals,\nthere were patients under consultants \u2026 other than\nthe doctor that we had as our contact. \u2026 Having\nthem on side was critical.\nA balance had to be struck, however, as the trial\nteam were not in the \u201cluxurious position\u201d of\nselecting only the most committed centres, but\nthey did feel that a \u201cfriendly relationship was\ncritical\u201d.\nA possible obstacle to the engagement of\ncollaborators for HPS was the anxiety among\nsome potential collaborators that lowering\ncholesterol, the primary aim of the trial, was\npotentially hazardous. It was therefore important\nthat such areas of concern could be addressed at\nan early stage. This was done through meetings in\nwhich the team presented the evidence and\nrationale for the trial, and through setting up a\ntelephone information help-line for any queries\nthat collaborators might have. \nThe advantages of being able to draw on a\nsubstantial existing research community were\nparticularly evident in accounts of the\ndevelopmental period for the FOCUS trial, a trial\nwith a very different starting point from those just\ndescribed. The trial was run by the MRC Clinical\nTrials Unit and was introduced into the cancer\nresearch community, which has a well-developed\ninfrastructure and a shared history of successful\nand committed collaboration within oncology.\nWhere a sense of academic loyalty and shared\nresearch experience already exists, this was\nconsidered to be an important advantage, as\ndescribed by one of the central team members:\n[It] very much built on what we\u2019ve done in the past.\nOne of the advantages of having a trials office like us\nwho run a series of trials in a certain disease, is that\nwe build up contacts and we build up rapport with the\nclinicians. So we had a very successful trial\n[previously] in the same group of patients and it was\nall the same clinicians basically. So having built that\nkind of community, when we started to promote the\nidea of having the next trial for the same group of\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n31\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.patients, we had all the mailing lists for that group of\nclinicians, and they were the same group of clinicians\nwho turned up at all the meetings etc etc. So that was\na very good foundation for starting off. We were\nstarting from quite a high level of interest.\nThere was very much a sense that the\ndevelopment of the FOCUS trial was fostered by\nan experienced and professional community. The\nset-up period for this trial involved a process of\nconsultation with many senior clinicians and\nprofessional bodies. The aim was not only to\nproduce a trial of sound design, which would\nreflect the concerns and interest of many of the\nsenior figures in the field, but also to promote a\nsense of commitment to recruitment among\npotential collaborators. This resulted in a trial that\nwas described very positively and characterised by\ncollaborators in interview as \u201cdemocratic\u201d and\n\u201cvery smooth\u201d.\nFor the FOCUS trial there was a sense of\nenthusiasm and opportunity that was clear in the\ninterviews. Trial participation was largely seen as\nimportant for developing strategies of care for\nfuture patients, but also as offering potentially\nimportant options for existing patients, especially\nin terms of the chance to access \u201ccutting-edge\u201d\ndrugs. It was seen as a \u201cwin\u2013win situation\u201d. A\nnumber of interviewees described the enthusiasm\nof this research community and a sense of\nexcitement felt at the launch meetings for the\ntrial. The collaborators were said to be very keen\nto start to use the study drugs and to be involved\nin a trial that was \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d. The\nenthusiasm has largely continued through the\ntrial. It appeared both to promote and to maintain\nlevels of support for the trial, possibly a major\nfactor in successful recruitment, which was\ncommented upon by one of the trial coordinating\nteam:\n[For] trials that don\u2019t recruit so well, [it must be]\ndifficult to try and drum up attention when it\u2019s falling\non deaf ears. Whereas it\u2019s ever increasing circles when\npeople are responsive and you\u2019re enthusiastic. It just\nbuilds momentum.\nKey stage I: Foundation work: establishing\nscientific rigour\nPart of the process of promoting and engaging\ncollaborators is to gain their confidence and\nintellectual support. The research focus and the\nmethods used are defining elements of a trial. It\nwas clearly of value to the trial teams interviewed\nhere to feel that their research was asking an\nimportant question in a methodologically sound\nway. The importance was not only for the team\nand funder\u2019s confidence in the trial: perceptions\nof the quality or research have been shown to have\ndirectly affected clinicians\u2019 willingness to recruit\ntheir patients.51,72 A crucial part of the foundation\nwork for the trials was therefore to establish the\nscientific credentials of the trial. The interviews for\nSTEPS included discussion of the importance of\nthe research question and the level of scientific\nrigour of the trials.\nImportance of the research question\nIt was striking that when the interviewees were\nasked for their views on the importance of the\nresearch question, they frequently responded in\nterms of its clinical rather than academic\nrelevance. It was obviously important to the\ninterviewees that the trials should be practical and\napplicable and the hope behind a comment made\nin connection with the FOCUS trial was echoed\nthroughout the interviews across the trials: \u201cIt\ncould change the course of the treatment of GI\n[gastrointestinal] cancers.\u201d For the ELEVATE trial\nan important factor in terms of the applicability of\nthe trial results was the common nature of the\ndisorder. A research assistant commented on this:\n\u201cit\u2019s very important because lots and lots and lots\nand lots of people have asthma \u2026 so I think the\nquestion\u2019s very relevant, and very real.\u201d Similarly,\nthere was considerable enthusiasm among the\ninterviewees for HPS, because of the relevance of\nthe research to a large clinical population. A nurse\nwho described the question addressed by HPS as\n\u201cexceptionally important\u201d explained:\nIt\u2019s such a high risk to the population, all of these\nconditions, and especially the cardiovascular\nconditions, that if we could find a way of reducing the\nrisk to people, then you know we could certainly\nreduce the mortality and incidence within Britain,\nbecause it has been gradually increasing.\nIn contrast, the TOuCAN study focused on a quite\nrare condition, for which the available approaches\nto care are not currently evidence based. Its value\nlay not in a broad application but as an empirical\nstarting point. One interviewee commented that\nthe question was \u201ca very crucial [one] because no-\none knows and there are no trials\u201d. Similarly,\nanother said: \u201cthere\u2019s a big hole in the literature\nin regard \u2026 to the treatment of anorexia nervosa\nin adolescents \u2026 so it is going to be highly\nuseful.\u201d\nFor all of the trials there was also appreciation of\nand interest in the more challenging aspects of the\nresearch questions, such as accessing populations\nthat are under-represented in research (TOuCAN,\nELEVATE and HPS) and assessing interventions\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n32that could arouse a degree of clinical controversy\n(FOCUS, HPS). The trials were often seen as\n\u201cambitious\u201d, \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201ccutting edge\u201d.\nWhile the PIs and their supporting team were not\nsurprisingly enthusiastic and very clear about the\nvalue of their research questions, they were aware\nthat support for their research could not be taken\nfor granted. In each trial the trialists knew that in\nthe initial stages some colleagues were not\nconvinced of the need for information, or were\nhappy with their existing approaches to care, and\nthey had to work to address this problem. For HPS\nthere was \u201cquite a lot of resistance in the medical\nworld\u201d, which this interviewee said had been\n\u201covercome enormously\u201d. Similarly, where there was\nsupport for the FOCUS trial it was said to be\n\u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d, although the trial also\nhad its objectors. For the ELEVATE trial there was\ndiscomfort among some GPs as they were being\nasked to consider working outside the approved\nnational strategies for asthma care. The teams\ntherefore put a great deal of effort into promoting\nunderstanding for the need for research evidence\nin their specific areas. The PI for the TOuCAN\nstudy had a policy of telephoning colleagues who\nhad queries, to address personally any concerns\nthat they might have about the research. The four\ntrial teams also hosted or attended clinical\nmeetings, ran training days and made visits to\nrecruiting centres. The interviewees who had\nattended trial events were very enthusiastic about\nboth the educational and the social aspects. HPS\noffered residential study days and these appeared\nto be particularly popular. \nEven though the Part B trials involved quite\ndifferent types of research questions, the\ninterviewees seemed to be equally enthusiastic\nabout the value of the research question. Each of\nthe trial questions was regularly described as being\n\u201cimportant\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cinteresting\u201d. The\nimportance of the question addressed by their trial\nwas rated by interviewees on a 0\u20135 Likert scale. All\ngave a rating of 4 or 5. One interviewee\ncommented on the value and influence of a well-\nconsidered research question for their trial:\nIt seemed to be the question that people wanted\nanswering. It\u2019s quite interesting that if you get the\nquestion right, everything else seems to sort of be so\nmuch more smooth.\nDesign of the trial\nAll four Part B trials were viewed very favourably\nby the interviewees in terms of their\nmethodological quality. When the interviewees\ndescribed the importance of the research question\nit was frequently and spontaneously expressed in\nconnection with their confidence in the design of\nthe trial to deliver results; essentially they felt that\nthe trials were scientifically robust. As with the\nimportance of the question addressed by the trial,\nthe quality of the design was rated by interviewees\non a 0\u20135 Likert scale. Almost all interviewees gave\na rating of 4 or 5.\nFor some of the interviewees, such as the PIs and\nother senior trialists, this response was from a\nmore informed perspective, not only because they\nknew the trial intimately, but also because they\nwere familiar with factors such as power\ncalculations and the implications of elements of\ndesign such as permitting cross-over. For some\nother interviewees, it related in part to their faith\nin the prime movers for the trials. One local\nclinician talked about his admiration for the\n\u201cfantastic work\u201d done by the PI in producing a\n\u201cbrilliant trial protocol\u201d. For another trial it was\nperceptions of the acuity involved in pitching and\ndelivering the trial: \u201cTheir knowledge about how\nto decide which questions to answer is probably\nsecond to none.\u201d\nThere was a sense for all of the trials of striving to\nmaintain the quality of the design in the face of\nquite onerous challenges. For the TOuCAN study\nthe referring consultants appeared to appreciate\nthe difficulties inherent in this trial, and perhaps\nthis added to their wish to see the research\nsucceed. When asked to reflect on the design of\nthe trial, one consultant commented:\nI was involved in another study which wanted to\ncompare inpatient with outpatient treatment and they\nnever got it off the ground. You know, it just didn\u2019t\ndeal with the realities of life. [The TOuCAN study]\nhas dealt with the realities of life. In view of the\ndifficulty of the task and the importance of work like\nthis, it seems to me to be pretty damned good.\nThe PI was clear that this trial only worked in such\na difficult clinical setting because he was prepared\nto tolerate a degree of compromise in the design.\nHe was the only interviewee in the study to give\nthe quality of the design of their trial a rating of 3.\nHe was clear, however, that any compromise to the\ndesign was born out of realism in order to make\nthe aims of the research achievable:\nIt\u2019s a compromise in terms of the treatments being\nevaluated and it\u2019s a compromise in order to maximise\nthe chances that the patients will consent to take\npart. \u2026 I think it was the best compromise to\npersuade clinical colleagues to take part.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n33\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.Key stage I: Foundation work: funding and other\nfinancial considerations\nHow financial costs are met and distributed is\npossibly one of the most crucial factors in the\nsuccess of a trial. Securing the initial funds is a\nchallenge in itself. Once these have been granted\nthere are additional areas in which financial issues\ncan play a part in shaping the research. If the\ninitial funds are limited, or there are\nunanticipated increased costs, there is the inherent\ndifficulty for the trial team of running a trial with\ninadequate funds to consider. There is also the\nlikelihood that financial considerations will affect\npotential collaborators\u2019 decisions about their\ninvolvement. Potential costs or savings are likely to\nbe factors in their decisions about whether or not\nto collaborate in a trial at all, and also how much\neffort to put into that collaboration.\nOf the four trials studied here, the TOuCAN study\nwas the only one where it was widely perceived\nthat recruitment to the trial was not affected\npositively or negatively by financial considerations.\nThe remaining trials faced not inconsiderable\nfinancial difficulties. These were addressed in a\nnumber of dynamic ways. The trial teams acted to\nprevent financial difficulties destabilising their\ntrials, and also intervened successfully to address\nfinancial issues as they arose.\nSecuring multisourced funds\nThe four trials had different paths to achieve their\nfunding, and this related in part to their initial\nchoice of funder, and in part to their differing\ncosts of and responsibilities for treatment.\nThe MRC usually funds research in the \u2018response\nmode\u2019; that is, the research idea originates with\nthe applicant as the creative figure who\ndetermines the direction of the research. However,\nfrom time to time the MRC makes \u2018calls for\nproposals\u2019, which seek to encourage research in\nstrategically important areas. In contrast, the latter\napproach is the norm for the HTA Programme,\nwhich seeks suggestions from the NHS and its\nusers about possible research priorities, and then\ncommissions research to answer those questions.\nWhichever the funder, the success of the trial\nteams in terms of gaining HTA Programme or\nMRC support initially was only part of the funding\nprocess. Both the TOuCAN study and the\nELEVATE trial required funding extensions to\nachieve their research aims.\nIn addition, the ELEVATE trial, HPS and the\nFOCUS trial all had additional funders. The PI\nfor one of the trials explains how complicated and\ndelicate an issue funding can be when researchers\nhave to deal with a number of potential sources of\nfunding:\n\u2026 trials are funded from different sources and\nresearch costs of the trial, which would be the cost of\nactually running the trial unit and gathering the data\nand doing the data analysis \u2013 that\u2019s the element of the\ncost for which one applies to charities or MRC. ...\n[We] had those costs fully met and [our] application\nwent through without a hitch. But in any trial like\nthis, the costs of actually delivering the treatment and\ndoing all the other stuff that goes along with treating\npatients may in fact be very much larger than the\nactual research costs. ... There were clearly going to\nbe issues of how we were going to obtain the drugs\nand get them into a trial which would involve a lot of\npatients in NHS hospitals around the country. ... So\npart of the reason why the trial took an awfully long\ntime to, to get off the ground initially was that ... we\nfelt that with trials like this that it was really only\nlikely to be a success if we could get the drug\ncompanies on board to the extent that they would\nprovide some free or discounted drugs for the trial.\nFor the FOCUS trial there was \u201ca difficult and\nlong drawn out process of negotiation\u201d with\nindustry and with the NHS to complete the level\nof funding needed, an experience echoed in HPS.\nFor HPS these negotiations were protracted,\ndespite initial success with a pilot study:\nThe idea was that we were going to do the study\nfunded solely by [a drug company] and they\nsupported a pilot study.\u2026 The gap that occurred\nbetween the pilot and the main study was merely an\nissue of getting the funding. We had initially been\nthinking about a ten thousand patient study but the\nmore we got into it the more we felt that a bigger\nstudy of twenty thousand patients would make more\nsense and we couldn\u2019t persuade [the drug company]\nto fund that\u2026So we spent some years pulling\ntogether the funding from a range of different sources\n[which] was extremely difficult. [There was] a lot of\nenthusiasm for doing the study from people that we\ncollaborated with on previous trials but what held it\nup was just getting the money in place\u2026 [Eventually]\nwe retrieved the [drug company] support and got\nsupport from [another drug company], as well as BHF\nand MRC but it was a long process.\nAs these funding difficulties created a gap of\nseveral years between the pilot and the main study,\nthere was the potential for damaging effects on\nrecruitment and the findings of the trial. This was\ndue to the impact of data emerging from other\ntrials in the course of the study. One interviewee\nexplained: \u201cthere were some types of patients in\nHPS for whom their own doctors wanted to use\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n34cholesterol lowering therapy. The study would\nhave achieved a bigger LDL cholesterol difference\nbetween the treatment groups if it had been done\nearlier.\u201d\nTreatment costs\nThe interviewee quoted above raised the subject of\ndifferent avenues of funding for research and\ntreatment costs. Trials such as HPS and the\nFOCUS trial which have MRC funding should in\ntheory be supported by an agreement with NHS\ntrusts, known as the Concordat. Under the terms\nof this agreement, while the MRC covers research\ncosts, the NHS trusts are obliged to take\nresponsibility for \u2018legitimate\u2019 service support and\ntreatment costs associated with MRC-funded\nresearch. Although the trialists involved in the\nFOCUS trial had negotiated the provision of some\nfree drugs from industrial sponsors, the treatment\ncosts were still described as \u201csignificant\u201d. Trusts\nvary in the funds that they have available for\nresearch and, in spite of the Concordat, there were\nsome areas where the treatment costs were not met\nand centres were unable to collaborate in the trial.\nA similar issue was faced for the ELEVATE trial,\nwhere industry was approached and agreed to\nmeet excess treatment costs while the HTA\nProgramme was to meet research costs. There was,\nhowever, for the three drug trials, an important\nmatter of academic integrity which was raised by\ntheir negotiations with industry.\nThe senior trialists explained how they had had to\nmaintain their own vision of the direction and\nfocus of their research questions. They were clear\nthat despite differing approaches to research and\n\u201cvery strong commercial agendas\u201d, the industrial\ncontributions had to be on a \u201cno strings attached\u201d\nbasis:\nWhen you negotiate with drug companies over\nobtaining drug supplies for trials, you usually find\nyourself negotiating with somebody who\u2019s from the\nbusiness unit or marketing unit of the company\nwhere, obviously, the priorities and the issues which\nthey bring to bear \u2026 will be commercial and \nbusiness decisions. So we went through quite a\ndifficult process of negotiating with companies \u2026\ntrying to decide whether or not we could compromise\non some of the questions which we wanted to ask or\nwhether we were going to stick by our guns and\npotentially end up with a more difficult trial to run\nbecause we didn\u2019t have funding. And we ended up\nwith a trial design where we had pretty much stuck to\nour guns and where the amount of drug company\nfunding was very much less than we might have\nwanted if we had compromised the design a bit \nmore.\nFor the ELEVATE trial their negotiation for\nadditional resources to fund treatment costs was\nessential, not only for the day-to-day running of\nthe trial, but also to allow them to \u201chead off the\nresistance we thought we might encounter from\nthe primary health costs holding the drug\nprescribing budgets for primary care\u201d.\nStaffing costs\nThe staffing costs for these trials varied\ntremendously. At one extreme there is HPS, a long-\nterm trial involving an \u201carmy\u201d of administrators\nand 69 recruiting centres, each with a funded,\ncentrally trained, time-dedicated research nurse. At\nthe other extreme is the TOuCAN study, a trial\ncarried out in a local setting, and for which\nadministration and recruitment are controlled by a\nsmall number of central staff.\nFor the ELEVATE and FOCUS trials, although\nresearch nurses in the recruiting centres were key\nmembers of the trial team, how they were to be\nresourced was a matter for negotiation. For the\nELEVATE trial a contribution was made to the\npractices to cover the research time contributed by\nthe practice nurse. For the FOCUS trial, although\npayments were made to the recruiting centres to\ncontribute towards nursing costs, some of the costs\nwere absorbed by the centres, and decisions had to\nbe made locally as to how to manage this\nsituation. In one centre resources were provided\nthrough R&D funding systems, and in another,\nnursing costs were met via industry links to\nprovide protected nursing time for the trial. In\ncomparison to the payments made to recruiting\ncentres for their contributions to industrial trials,\nthe income from academic trials can seem to be\nless than lucrative, as discussed by a member of\nstaff at a recruiting centre:\nWe have a commitment to the MRC trials first. We\nwould always recruit to them before an industry\nsponsored one. But that\u2019s because we\u2019re an academic\ndepartment. If you\u2019ve got issues of paying research\nnurses\u2019 wages and you\u2019ve got a study that pays five\nthousand pound per patient or one that pays two\nhundred pound per patient\u2026! But we\u2019re quite lucky\nbecause we have a huge patient catchment, so we\u2019ve\nnever got a problem in finding patients for any of our\nstudies.\nThis raises an important question of competition\nbetween industry and academic trials, a factor\nwhich was likely to shape the ability to collaborate\nwith academic trials for smaller, less well-resourced\ndepartments. Competition for patients was also an\nissue for the ELEVATE trial (see section \u2018Key stage\n2: Recruitment processes\u2019, p. 37).\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.There were, however, also some feelings of\noptimism about staffing issues to permit trial\ncollaboration. As one collaborator in the FOCUS\ntrial said:\nNow this is improving again\u2026with the NCRN, we\u2019ve\ngot 12 nurses now and some data managers. And so it\nactually does make it easier\u2026 there is a definite\nimprovement, even though things aren\u2019t as you would\nwish, because there are still too many patients. But it\u2019s\ndefinitely a good start.\nFinancial implications for collaborators\nWhere trials may involve costs to collaborators,\nthis can be \u201cthe final straw\u201d in decisions about\njoining a trial. This is a particular concern for\ntrials in general practice. The ELEVATE trial\nworked to avoid costs to their collaborators. In a\nhighly pressured context it can not only be\nirksome for GPs to feel that they are used as an\nunpaid extension to a research team, but also\nresult in poor levels of recruitment. A GP\nexplained the nature of the problem:\nPeople forget that general practices are actually small\nbusinesses and they are funded in a completely\ndifferent way to hospitals. \u2026 If you are a teaching\nhospital there may be funding in the system for the\nidea of supporting research. In general practice\nresearch is not a core thing that is funded at all. \u2026\nEven things like sending out letters, stamps on\nenvelopes and secretarial time, all of that costs money.\nThe only place that that money will come out of is the\npractice profits, which is basically the partners\u2019\nincome, so unless it is adequately funded you are\nactually asking the individual GPs to take home less\nmoney in order to do the research. That is just not\nthe case in hospitals. It doesn\u2019t affect the doctors\u2019 or\nnurses\u2019 incomes at all [if] research goes on. \u2026 In a lot\nof practices that is a big barrier. Unfunded research is\na real problem.\nAs the ELEVATE trial was developed by GPs, in\nconsultation with GPs, there was sensitivity to the\nneed to protect practices from any costs arising\nfrom their collaboration. The trial team reacted\nswiftly to early recruitment problems and radically\nmodified their administrative procedures,\ndirecting the workload away from the practices.\nThis required greater human resources than\npreviously anticipated. Additional funds were\ngiven by the HTA Programme to introduce new\nmembers of staff and to pay for occasional use of\nindependent agency research nurses, thus\nproviding the necessary support to the practices.\nThis changed the requirement for the practices to\ncarry out time-consuming searches, and the entire\nway in which potential participants were identified\nand recruited was refined. It was mentioned by\nnurses and GPs alike that without this intensive\ninput from the trial team, the trial would have\nbeen impossible to carry out. \nIn addition to a contribution to primary care trust\n(PCT) prescribing budgets, the practices that\ncollaborated with the trial were also given a\ncontribution to their funds to cover nursing time,\nsomething that was thought to be likely to\npromote \u201ca stronger collaboration\u201d. Although one\nGP argued that this did not cover the costs\ninvolved, it was still widely viewed as an effective\nand essential strategy. The aim was largely to keep\nthe costs of collaboration \u201cneutral\u201d.\nThe potential for some costs to the practices was\npossibly counterbalanced by one particular\nfinancial benefit of the trial. One GP spoke very\nclearly of the balance of any cost to a practice of\nparticipation in the trial and the benefits of\naccessing assistance with some of the more difficult\nasthma cases. In accordance with their NHS\ncontracts, GP practices are required to\ndemonstrate that they have improved the\nmanagement of such cases, and this can be a\nlengthy, labour-intensive process. The trial could\ntherefore be seen as an important opportunity for\nhard-pressed professionals to gain assistance with\nthis difficult task, and for their asthma patients to\naccess a greater degree of support and nursing\ntime than would usually be offered. \nClearly, the possibility of costs to collaborators can\nbe a deterrent to initial involvement in a trial. For\nthe FOCUS trial this issue had been addressed at\nan early stage and the cooperation of the\ncollaborators had been secured, but a potential\nthreat to that relationship arose at a later stage.\nHalfway through the trial one of the drug\ncompanies withdrew its support, with the result\nthat treatment costs would subsequently need to\nbe absorbed by the collaborators. Although this\nwas very worrisome, by this time the trial, its\ncommunity and treatment patterns seem to have\nbeen sufficiently established that it did not impact\nupon recruitment:\nRespondent: We thought this was going to be an\nabsolute disaster, and nothing\nhappened. Nobody really bothered;\nthey just kept on accruing to the \ntrial.\nInterviewer:  So the hospitals were basically paying\nto recruit people into your trial?\nRespondent:  Well yes, you could say that, although\noutside the trial they were \nprobably getting exactly the same\ntreatment.\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n36Interviewer:  And that still didn\u2019t affect recruitment?\nRespondent:  It didn\u2019t affect recruitment.\nKey stage 2: Recruitment processes\nOnce the engagement of more senior\ncollaborators had been secured, and appropriate\nfinancial support for the trial and the recruiting\ncentres established, another tier of professional\ninvolvement was introduced to the trials. Whereas\nthe TOuCAN study used central trial team\nrecruiters, recruitment to the other Part B trials\nrelied heavily on the cooperation of nurses in\nrecruiting centres. Some of these nurses were in\nexisting posts and took on additional\nresponsibilities for the trials, and some were\nemployed specifically for the purpose of\nrecruitment. The nurses also took on the role of\nmotivating and reminding colleagues about\nrecruitment issues for the trials in which they were\ninvolved. The processes involved in recruitment\nshow how the different teams have considered\nfactors that are likely to affect participation in\ntheir particular settings.\nThe TOuCAN study maintained tight central\ncontrol over the process of recruitment, an\napproach that in part was driven by an\nunderstanding of the complications inherent in\ndealing with their target population of adolescents\naffected by anorexia nervosa. Recruitment was\npredominantly carried out by a small number of\nnon-clinical research assistants who became very\nexperienced in talking to prospective participants\nand their families over the course of the trial. \nThe protocol suggested that the trial team should\nbe alerted whenever CAMHS received a new\nreferral of anorexia, before the professionals\ninvolved met with the young person to make a\nclinical assessment. The aim was to retain central\ncontrol over the information given to potential\nparticipants, and to avoid establishing a\ntherapeutic engagement at a local level. Such an\nengagement may have made the adolescents or\ntheir families reluctant to consider care in any\nother location, thus increasing the chances of\nrefusal to participate in the trial. It may also have\ncomplicated the experience for those allocated\naway from local care. \nOnce the trial team had been given contact\ndetails, a researcher visited the family to describe\nthe trial and take consent if they wished to enrol.\nAs the adolescents had reached a point where they\nwere being diagnosed with the condition, they\nwere already at quite a serious stage in their\nillness. This could shape both the tone and\nmanagement of the discussions about trial\nparticipation. Although there was a widespread\nview in the interviews with clinicians that the\npopulation available to the trial was\npredominantly middle-class, high-achieving,\nteenage girls, who responded to the interest shown\nby the trial team, those who made the home or\nhospital visits for the trial described some\nsituations in which it was very difficult to engage\nthe adolescents in conversation. Among the\nyounger patients, or those hospitalised or eating\nand drinking very little, poor levels of\nconcentration or responsiveness could be\nsignificant issues. There were some initial anxieties\nabout random allocation of treatment in this\ncontext and the response of the team reflects an\nunderstanding of what is feasible against the\nbackdrop of a condition such as anorexia nervosa.\nWhere adolescents felt uncomfortable they were\ntold that they were not obliged to accept the\nallocated treatment, an approach that would not\noften be encouraged in other trial settings. They\nwere, however, asked to go along to the service to\nwhich they were allocated for an assessment and to\nlearn more about what was on offer. If possible,\nthe team tried to encourage participants to try the\nservice for a 6-week period before choosing to\nswap to one of the other treatments. If they were\nstill unsure, or if they declined randomisation,\nthere was the option of allowing data collection in\na naturalistic arm (essentially a patient preference\narm) of the trial. This approach to recruitment, as\nwell as the inclusion of the naturalistic arm,\noffered patients who did not wish to have control\ntaken away from them an important expression of\nautonomy.\nThis form of patient preference trial was described\nas \u201ca compromise between a pure RCT and a\nnaturalistic study\u201d and was driven by an\nunderstanding of the likely resistance among\nanorexic patients to a more rigid approach. The\nintention was that in permitting a degree of\nclinical and personal autonomy that might not be\ntolerated in trials in other settings, the chances of\nprofessional and patient participation in the trial\nwould be increased. These strategies appear to\nhave worked as the TOuCAN study is following up\nover 90% of the local cases of anorexia nervosa,\nwith 78% of these randomised and 22% in the\nnaturalistic arm. Cross-over between the\nrandomised treatments arms was 33%, which was\nless than originally feared.\nIn the ELEVATE trial and HPS, responsibility for\nthe recruitment processes was shared between the\ncentral trial teams and collaborating centre nurses.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n37\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.The trial teams controlled the labour-intensive\nprocedures involved in trawling records and\ndatabases to identify and book clinic appointments\nwith potential participants, and then passed\nrecruitment over to the nurses working at a local\nlevel. For HPS, these nurses were employed in\neach collaborating centre specifically to work on\nrecruitment to the trial. They were trained by the\ncentral trial coordinating centre and were then\ngiven a high degree of local autonomy. It became\ntheir responsibility to find office and clinic space\nfor recruitment and they regulated their own time.\nFor the ELEVATE trial, the nurses were largely\nexisting practice nurses who took on a commitment\nto recruitment as part of their general duties, for\nwhich the practices were reimbursed. Where a\npractice was not able to supply a nurse, the trial\nteam employed four independent agency nurses\nwho were occasionally placed in a practice to\nrecruit to the trial. The more senior collaborators\nin the two trials who had permitted the research to\nrun in their centres had a minimal role in\nrecruitment, although opportunistic recruitment,\noften at the prompt of the research nurses, could\ntake place via their own caseloads.\nThe patients who were eligible for the ELEVATE\ntrial were those with poorly controlled asthma.\nDuring the course of the trial, a competing\ncommercial drug trial was established. Potential\nparticipants for this trial were, in the opinion of\ntwo of the interviewees, often those who were\neasier to recruit, and their recruitment elsewhere\nhad implications for the ELEVATE trial. Not only\nwas the available population reduced, the\nperceived characteristics of the remaining\npopulation was thought to have shaped, if not\ncomplicated, the process of recruitment in\nimportant ways. A number of interviewees made\nthe point that these remaining patients often did\nnot define themselves as having asthma; rather,\nthey felt that they had some breathing difficulties\nfor which they had been prescribed an inhaler. It\nwas more difficult to persuade such patients of the\nrelevance of the trial to their situation, and\naccepting the offer of recruitment could mean\naccepting a (possibly unsettling) status as an\nasthmatic, with implications for required drug\nregimens. The asthma symptoms for some\npatients were poorly controlled as they were not\ncompliant with their prescribed medication. They\noften did not attend for monitoring and they were\na difficult group to recruit. Given the difficulties\nassociated with this population, the trial team\nmade enormous efforts to track down as many\npotential participants as possible.\nOnce patients had been identified, similar\nrecruitment procedures were used by both HPS\nand the ELEVATE trial. Clinic appointments were\nmade by the central teams with patients (in itself a\ntime-consuming process which, for the ELEVATE\ntrial, included calling many potential participants\nat home in the evenings and weekends), at which\nthey would be assessed to confirm eligibility for\nthe trial. The nurses were responsible for\ninforming patients about the trial and for taking\nconsent from those wishing to join. For both trials\nthe recruitment procedures involved several\nappointments and typically took place over a \n6-week period for the ELEVATE trial and an \n8-week period for HPS.\nFor these trials, the clear delineation of\nresponsibility for identification and recruitment of\npotential participants was given by most of the\nlocal health professionals as a condition of their\nagreement to collaborate. This was not surprising\nas the process of identification for both trials was\ndaunting. It was estimated that just for one large\ngeneral practice, the ELEVATE trial team\nidentified and wrote to 800 patients in order to\nbring 30 to the clinic. For HPS, the trial team\nwrote to 131,000 patients and screened over\n63,000 in the recruiting centres to achieve their\nsample of 20,000 participants. This extraordinary\neffort at a central level made the collaborating\ncentres\u2019 own involvement far less onerous,\nallowing the nurses to concentrate on screening\nand recruitment. The collaborators who were\ninterviewed were well aware of the value of the\ncentral identification processes and of having\nprotected nursing time for recruitment. One of\nthe HPS interviewees commented on how the\nsystem of recruitment was crucially important for\nhis centre, both in terms of allowing sufficient\ntime for the trial processes and for protection of\nhis own time and duties:\nThe nurses go down to Oxford, they\u2019re fully trained,\nthey know how to organise the clinics, so my\ninvolvement in these clinics was minimal. \u2026 When we\nwere recruiting the patients \u2026 I was required to put\nmy signature on the forms, but that was very much a\nrubber-stamping job. \u2026 If it was in competition with\nour service commitment, it would very quickly be\nsidelined and we wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.\nThis point was made repeatedly by recruiting centre\nstaff for HPS and ELEVATE and was well\nrecognised by the trial teams; one member of a trial\nteam described how they had come to recognise\nthat in order to promote recruitment it was\nimportant that their own research teams should do\n\u201call but the most minimal of processes\u201d.\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n38For the FOCUS trial, both identification and\nrecruitment of participants were entirely under\nlocal control. It was usual for a member of the\nclinical oncology staff to identify eligible patients.\nA consultant would initially explain the trial to the\npatients, usually in the context of discussion of the\nmanagement of the advancing nature of their\ndisease. A research nurse would then give further\ndetails of the trial and arrange to see the patient\nagain some days later, to take consent and initiate\ntheir therapy if they wished to enrol in the trial.\nThe collaborating centres were given a\ncontribution towards nursing costs which allowed\nfor some protected nursing time, but the centres\nappeared to vary in the level of resources that were\navailable. The nurses who were interviewed had a\nstrong identity both as oncology nurses and as\nresearch nurses, and this was reflected in their\napproaches to recruitment. The process of\nrecruitment to the FOCUS trial could involve\nseveral appointments if the nurse felt that the\npatients were overloaded and needed more time\nto understand or to consider their decision. This\nwas important as it could involve patients who had\nonly just learned that their disease was inoperable.\nIt was very clear that despite their own\ncommitment to research generally and to the\nFOCUS trial specifically, the research nurses did\nsee themselves as having primary responsibility to\nthe patients. The decisions that patients were\nasked to make were in the context of the last\nmonths of their life and so the nurses felt that\nthey needed to draw on their own professional\nexperience, and on \u201cwider nursing issues\u201d, to\nassist this potentially rather vulnerable group\nthrough the trial processes. It seemed to be\nimportant to the nurses that recruitment was\ncarried out in a supportive, patient-centred\nenvironment. The fact that it was governed locally\nappeared to offer nurses an important sense of\nprofessional autonomy, in which they were free to\nexercise their own values. One nurse argued that\nthe nursing perspective was rather different to that\nof the doctors and this may shape who enters a\ntrial, as well as the style of recruitment:\nIf a patient were to come to a clinic, and the\nconsultant or doctor [said that] this person would be\nfeasible to go into FOCUS, say if they\u2019d already had\nchemo in the past, or they might not be fit and well,\nthe medical staff might view it a bit differently to how\nwe would. We might think they\u2019re not suitable to go\ninto a study. I think a lot of the time we\u2019re looking at\nthings from a different perspective, perhaps we\u2019re\nlooking at things more as an advocate. And although\nwe are there to recruit, we\u2019re also there to protect the\npatients. \u2026 They [can] be quite a vulnerable group.\nAnother nurse explained how the discussion of\nrecruitment to the trial was potentially shaped by\nboth the type of patients and the \u201cemotivity of the\ndisease\u201d. Although among the target population of\npatients with advanced metastatic bowel cancer\nthere is a bias towards older patients, there are\nsome younger patients and she argued that these\ntwo groups approached both their disease and the\ntrial very differently. This meant that they needed\na different type of input from their research nurse: \n[The older patients] are not quite as inquisitive as the\nyounger generation, and probably not as fearful. ...\nAnd maybe there\u2019s something to do with their\nperception of the nursing and the medical profession.\nThey have still got that [view] that the doctor\u2019s the be-\nall and end-all, and you [accept] everything what the\ndoctor says, and that lovely nurse type of thing. You\ntry to get away from that, [saying] \u2018This is about you.\nYou\u2019ve got as much right to make a decision\u2019. But the\nelderly population do hold everybody in a much\nhigher regard.\u2026 The younger age group \u2026 are more\nfearful, more frightened about the situation they\u2019re in.\nThey might have a young family and things like that.\nYou have to usually put a lot more in with them,\nbecause you\u2019ve got to get past the diagnosis, you\nknow, help them with cope with the diagnosis before\nyou go onto the treatment.\nClearly, in recruiting to the FOCUS trial the\nnurses were required to draw on their professional\nskills to manage a particularly difficult situation.\nTheir degree of specialism, in terms of both their\nunderstanding of research and of the patients\u2019\nneeds, seemed to produce a very careful and\nmeasured style of recruitment.\nKey stage 3: delivery of care \nConcern for patient welfare and for the impact of\ntrial participation on patients has been shown to be\na major obstacle to professional involvement in\ntrials in a number of studies. There have been trials\nthat have caused a degree of professional anxiety;41\nprofessional non-participation72,73 or non-\ncompliance34 can ensue if the treatment allocation\nis not thought to be in the patients\u2019 best interest.\nRecruitment, retention and patient compliance may\nall be affected in trials that are designed with\ninsufficient sensitivity to patients\u2019 concerns or\nneeds,74 and trials where patients may prefer one\narm can be particularly difficult.75 It therefore\nseems likely that protecting patient welfare may well\nbe a factor in promoting recruitment, through\nmaintenance of professional confidence and patient\nsatisfaction. The quality of care offered in the\ncontext of the Part B trials, and the subject of what\nthe trials were thought to offer patients, were\ntherefore explored with the interviewees.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n39\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.The discussions tapped an important area of\nprofessional interest and often took a substantial\nportion of the interview time. It was clear that\nhigh standards of patient care within a research\nframework were particularly valued and the\ninterviewees for each of the four trials largely\nconveyed a sense of professional satisfaction with\nthe care offered to their own patients. This\npossible impact on the delivery of care in the\ncontext of the Part B trials can be examined in the\ncontext of attitudes to the interventions offered in\nthe trial, and the perceived effect of association\nwith the trial on care for patients and for clinical\npractice.\nImpact of the trial interventions for patients\nThe interventions being tested in the four trials\nwere statin therapy and vitamins (HPS),\nchemotherapy agents (FOCUS), asthma\nmedication (ELEVATE) and packages of inpatient\nand outpatient psychiatric care (TOuCAN). HPS\nwas the only study to include placebo. There was a\ndegree of optimism expressed in the interviews\nthat the interventions would prove to be effective\nand that the trials therefore constituted a means of\naccessing a potentially helpful form of care.\nPerceptions of the importance of the individual\ntreatments themselves were, however, quite\ndifferent. In the interviews with staff involved in\nthe ELEVATE trial, for instance, there was less\ndiscussion of the possible impact of the drugs\ninvolved, and more interest in the delivery of\nnurse-based supportive care, which was the same\nfor both groups. A similar issue pertained for\nHPS, even though the trial has reported very\npersuasive results. The two trials in which the\ninterventions under consideration were thought to\nhave a greater impact on patients were the\nTOuCAN study and the FOCUS trial.\nThe planned use of randomisation to determine\nthe care offered in the TOuCAN study raised\nvaried responses among the community of\nprofessionals in the development stage of the trial,\nas described in \u2018Key Stage 2\u2019 (p. 37). As this group\nheld sway over referrals to the trial, their\nperceptions of the possible impact of the trial\ntreatments for their patients could be an\nimportant determinant of recruitment. The\nconsultants who had referred their patients to the\nTOuCAN study were, however, relatively at ease\nwith the different treatment options, seeing both\nadvantages and disadvantages to inpatient and\noutpatient care. All described the professional\nstresses inherent in dealing with anorexia nervosa,\nwith sleepless nights and much anxiety, but they\ndid not suggest that any possible impact of the\ndifferent treatments considered in the trial caused\nthem particular concern. One commented \u201cI am\nfairly comfortable with it all really\u201d. The allocation\nprocess seemed to be tolerated even where the\nprofessionals had a degree of preference in one\ndirection or another:\nI\u2019m uncertain about the place and benefit,\nparticularly of long inpatient admission, so would\nalways be inclined to have a go at kind of\nmotivational outpatient treatment first. So having \nto refer people on [at an] earlier [stage in their\nillness] has been frustrating, [but] worry is too strong\na word.\nWhen another consultant described a preference\nfor community rather than inpatient care, he was\nalso asked whether allocation of patients to\ninpatient care caused him concern:\nI don\u2019t mind if they try [inpatient care], I\u2019m interested\nto see what happens. I\u2019ve got enough people to worry\nabout without getting too worried [about that]. I\u2019m\nnot one of the sort of anxious rather conservative\npeople who [is concerned that] the trial might have\nstopped me having a hospital admission [because] you\ndon\u2019t get them much anyway. And I know I could twist\npeople\u2019s arms when I want to.\nThere was an important strand in the interviews\nwhich indicated that at times the ability to use the\ntrial as a means of strategising the care of the\nmost difficult cases, with the possibility that they\nwould in fact be randomised on to those with\ngreater experience of care for problematic\npatients, could be \u201can absolute Godsend\u201d, \u201ca relief\nto get a difficult case off your mind\u201d. One clinician\nthought that some professionals who are\nparticularly \u201cembattled\u201d would be \u201cdelighted to\nhave a trial to refer to\u201d as it offered \u201can\nopportunity to get people a more expert\ntreatment than they would\u2019ve done otherwise\u201d.\nAnother interviewee explained:\nThe children concerned often cause a great deal of\nprofessional anxiety because they can be physically\nvery ill as well as psychologically ill and so they might\nbe few children but [they are] very worrying children.\nThere may be an element that the team felt that it\nwas helpful to be plugged into a centre of excellence\nand to be able to draw on that expertise. I could\nimagine there would be some departments which are\nmuch smaller and less well-resourced where they\u2019d be\nvery grateful for the chance to pass some of their\nchildren on to a centre of excellence.\nIt was notable that they presented the patients and\nfamilies within their care as being very much\nindividuals with different needs. For some patients\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n40and families, inpatient care could be difficult,\nwhile for others it was seen as offering a valuable\nopportunity to provide some space between\nadolescents and their families. The degree of\nflexibility afforded to the families and\nprofessionals through the opportunity to decline\nor override the allocated treatment seemed to be\nessential. It was also suggested that the treatment\noptions within the trial might in fact be in greater\nharmony with the views of the families than with\nthe professionals:\nThese families often have a belief in inpatient\ntreatment and distance centres and specialist centres\nand so sort of the idea that two of the three options\nare actually specialist options is consistent for these\nfamilies with what they think they want.\nThe professional views of the impact of the\ntreatments available in the FOCUS trial provide\nquite a contrast to those just described. Although\nthere was recognition in the interviews that cancer\npatients do have differing needs, and will make\nvery personal and individual decisions about the\ncare that they wish to receive, trial enrolment was\nlargely seen as offering access to drugs that were\nwidely thought to be potentially very helpful but\nwere otherwise not readily available.\nThis became a hugely important and quite\ncomplicated issue for the FOCUS trial. The\npublication of guidelines restricting the use of\nirinotecan and oxaliplatin by the NICE in 2002\n(see \u2018Results\u2019, p. 26) was highly contentious.\nPractitioners now faced restricted access to what\nwere seen by some as \u201ccutting-edge\u201d drugs, and\nthe FOCUS trial was established as the main\naccess route for oxaliplatin in the UK. The NICE\ndebate also brought to the fore discussions about\nthe differences in availability between the UK and\nother parts of Europe and the USA, with the\nacknowledgement that patients may learn of the\nexistence of drugs but then be given the\npotentially demoralising information that access in\nthe UK is restricted.76 It should be noted that it\nwas not impossible to access these drugs as they\nare licensed for use in the UK, but there are\nimportant prescribing costs to be considered that\ncould effectively prohibit their use for many\npractitioners. A nurse described how she\npresented this situation to patients when offering\nparticipation in the trial, trying to balance\ninformation giving with avoidance of stress and\npressure in an already difficult situation:\n[Now] you don\u2019t want to force a patient to go into\ntrial, but I do say that by going into the FOCUS\nstudy, there is oxaliplatin available. We don\u2019t have\nfunding for that outside the study. I think you have to\nsay that as being honest with the patient; that we\ndon\u2019t have it. But you don\u2019t want to put it in a way\nthat \u2018Well if you don\u2019t go in this study, you just don\u2019t\nget this drug\u2019. \nThere was a view that there was some evidence of\nefficacy from data from other trials, and some\ninterviewees felt that there were perceptible\nbenefits in the survival times for their existing\npatients:\nIf you don\u2019t have chemotherapy your mean survival is\nabout six to nine months. 5FU is about 12 months.\nIrinotecan and oxaliplatin about 15, 16 months. And\nthen all three of them is 20. So every little step is\nimportant. So I suppose you want people to receive\nall drugs, if they can, in a tolerable way.\nThere were differing opinions among the\ninterviewees over the impact of this shift on\nrecruitment to the trial. Some practitioners \nstated that they explicitly and deliberately\nrecruited to the trial in order to access drugs. A\nnurse argued that the impact of the limitations on\nthe availability of the drugs was probably\ndisproportionate, with the restrictions being \nfelt most keenly by smaller centres where funding\nfor irinotecan outside the trial would be\nimpossible. Larger centres did have funding\nagreements that made it somewhat easier to access\nthe drugs. She suggested that it was the limitation\nplaced on the smaller centres that probably\nimpacted positively on their levels of recruitment\nto the trial. Although the issue of limited\navailability of irinotecan for patients allocated to\nthree of the trial arms was of concern to some\ninterviewees (before the change in trial design to\npermit cross-over), this appeared to be\ncounterbalanced by the attraction of the\navailability of the restricted oxaliplatin within the\nFOCUS trial. A consultant articulated a sense of\ncompromise:\nAt least in the FOCUS trial you could get all three\ndrugs at some point. And so I suppose we felt that\nevery trial isn\u2019t perfect, but even on the control\narm\u2026they could get oxaliplatin afterwards. That trial\nwas good for that. That\u2019s why we put patients into it.\nTwo consultants explained that an important\nattraction of the trial was the ways in which it\ncould structure care for patients. Although the\nFOCUS trial is undoubtedly complicated, the\ndesign could be seen as a treatment guide, \u201ca plan\nfor life for patients\u201d, mapping out exactly what\nwould happen step by step, including\nconsideration of patients\u2019 care after the trial\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n41\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.period ended. The knowledge that an alternative\ndrug would be available on progression of their\ndisease was described as \u201cpositive\u201d as it promoted\npatient confidence in their treatment. There was,\nhowever, some degree of compromise. Although\nall of the drugs are available within the trial, not\nall patients will survive to receive them. A\nconsultant described how this was balanced with\nthe search for a way of giving the best treatment in\nthe most tolerable form:\nIf you say 100 percent of people get level one, the\nfirst treatment, actually only about 50 percent get the\nsecond level. And probably 10 to 20 percent get the\nthird level. [You] might find that you get somebody\nwho\u2019s fighting fit at the beginning, their disease\nprogresses in the first three or four months, they\u2019re\nnever fit enough to receive anything more. So there\u2019s\npros and cons of it all. I suppose by giving too much\ntreatment up front you might make their life\nintolerable. And so there\u2019s a happy medium\nsomewhere there.\nImpact of some of the trial processes for patients\nTrials can offer more than simply the treatments\nin the protocol. Whereas the available literature on\nbarriers to recruitment suggests many ways in\nwhich patient care can be affected by the offer of\ntrial participation,15 the interviewees for the trials\nstudied here often described very positive effects\nof patient association with a trial.\nAll of the trials involved an appreciable level of\nhuman contact and patient support in their\nprocedures. For the TOuCAN study the attention\npaid to the adolescents both in the recruitment\nprocedures, which involved a visit to their home or\nhospital bed, and for follow-up was thought to be\na very positive element of the experience. A\nconsultant commented:\nI think people have, have, quite enjoyed being part of\nit really. You know they do get quite a fuss made of\nthem and, and, they get to go back for the one and\ntwo year follow-ups. I just saw someone last week who\nhad been back for a two year follow-up and was quite\nenjoying that really. \nFor FOCUS, ELEVATE and HPS, a significant\ndegree of patient association with the trials\ninvolved contact with a research nurse. The nurses\nhad important roles in recruitment to the trials,\nbut they placed their own duties very much in the\nlarger context of their duties as a nurse. This\nmeant acting not only as a patient advocate during\nthe decision-making process, especially for the\nFOCUS trial where those considering enrolment\nmight be feeling vulnerable and overwhelmed, but\nalso as a health professional with a chance to\nintervene to affect patient well-being.\nThe ELEVATE trial and HPS both involved an\ninitial screening visit in the recruitment process,\nwherein potential participants underwent a\nnumber of tests and were asked questions about\ntheir health and health management. Several of\nthe nurses commented that they appreciated the\nluxury of long appointments (up to 1 hour) for\neach patient, where concerns could be expressed\nand a relationship could be built up, a sharp\ncontrast to the usual constraints on their time. For\nboth trials the nurses said that at the initial\nappointments they included an extra degree of\ninput that was not required by the study protocol,\nsuch as carrying out blood pressure checks. Some\nwent to considerable lengths to ensure that GPs\nwere made aware of any possible problems and\nclearly saw their encounter with patients as a\nhealth education opportunity. \nThere was reported to be an effect of the\nscreening appointment for patients who had\npoorly controlled asthma who were invited to join\nthe ELEVATE trial. It seemed that for some\npatients the discussion of their symptoms and\nasthma management promoted greater use of\npreventive medication (rather than simply\nsymptom relief), and improved their control of\nsymptoms to a point that they had become\nineligible for the trial by the time of their second\nvisit. \nNot only were there benefits of patient access to a\nnurse, it also seemed that there was a helpful\ncontinuity of care. Participants could establish a\nrelationship with the research nurse that could\ncontinue throughout their participation in a trial\nand beyond. A research nurse from HPS said:\nI still see those people locally now and they talk to me\nand still recognise me and you know, there\u2019s still that\ngood relationship there.\nSeveral interviewees articulated a view in which it is\nin patients\u2019 best interests to enter the trial because\nof the broader package of supportive care. One\nnurse linked to the FOCUS trial clearly felt this:\nI feel bad for people that don\u2019t go in it because you\nthink, well who is their nurse if they\u2019re not on a trial,\nyou know, who\u2019s going to be providing that extra\nsupport? \u2026 All they get is the outpatient nurses who\nare really stretched and pushed themselves. So I feel\n[that] a lot of the time they get extra counselling and\nextra one on one support, which people don\u2019t\n[usually] get.\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n42The ability to interact with patients not only\nemphasised the importance of patient care, an\nelement that is likely to appeal to health\nprofessionals, but also de-emphasised the research\nelement, which can become uncomfortably\ndisproportionate in some trials in difficult settings. \nKey stage 4: Delivery of research\nHowever great the effort that is put into the\ndevelopment of a trial and the management of\nclinical elements of the research, if a trial is\ninefficient and its management poorly thought\nout, success is likely to be compromised. Delivery\nof the research depends on practical input to\nsecuring patient contact, implementation of trial\nprocedures, data collection and analysis. This\nsection considers how this key stage of the trials\nwas conducted. It is an enormous shared task, and\nso it describes not only perceptions of the value of\nsound administration, and the ways in which\nmotivational strategies were employed to maintain\nthe profile of the trial, but also how those with a\nvariety of responsibilities to the trials are brought\ntogether as a team with the aim of protecting or\nimproving recruitment (see also Chapter 4).\nTeamwork\nFor the TOuCAN study it was said that promoting\nteamwork and effective communication had been\n\u201ca challenge in itself \u201d. This was not surprising as\nthe team structures of the trials studied here were\noften highly complicated. There seemed to be a\nnumber of teams within their larger frameworks.\nThe central coordinators operate as a team, as do\ngroups of doctors and nurses working in recruiting\ncentres. Even where there is only one individual in\na centre, either making referrals or recruiting to\nthe trial, there was often an articulation of\nmembership of a larger team working in a\ndifferent way, but in a collective fashion, towards a\nshared goal. The relationships between the various\nindividuals and groups were important, creating\nwhat was described in one interview as \u201cthe\nchemistry of the team\u201d:\nKey factors in success are having a good group of\npeople who really can figure out what their roles are.\nCommunicating well and fulfilling promises. [Central\nteam members need to] understand [recruiting centre\nstaff \u2019s] perspectives and their concerns.\nIf individuals do not fulfil their professional\ncommitments to other team members or to the\ntrial, and in turn are pressured or irritated by\nrequests for action, a trial is unlikely to run\nsmoothly. Here the interviewees often mentioned\ntheir colleagues within a trial team very positively.\nThe centres felt supported by the central teams\nand frequently said that they were given prompt\nanswers to any queries. A GP involved in the\nELEVATE trial contrasted his experience of this\nteam with that of another trial:\nI think that the most important thing has been the\nsupport from the researchers [and] the infrastructure\nthat has been provided. \u2026 I contrast that with a study\nI was doing for a commercial research organisation\nwhich was overly burdensome with paperwork [and\ninvolved] very poor support from the research\nassistants. In the end we didn\u2019t recruit anybody for\ntheir trial.\nWorking as a team is not, however, something that\nhappens naturally. It requires particular input\nfrom those involved to maintain and regulate their\nown and others\u2019 positions within the trial. One\ninterviewee argued that without clarity over roles\nand expectations of team members, a trial is likely\nto fail:\nA recipe for a failing trial is to have a committee\ndesigning a trial with a weak PI who isn\u2019t 100 per cent\ncommitted and who leaves the trial office to do the\nwork.\nMulticentre trials are dependent for their success\non the contributions made to recruitment by those\nwho are, more commonly than not, volunteering\nto work on their trials. As described above, the\ncentral teams worked to create a sense of\ncommitment and loyalty to the trials through\nbuilding relationships, giving information and\naddressing concerns. The training sessions and\nclinical meetings that were offered to all\ncollaborators for HPS appeared to be particularly\neffective on all three fronts. \nThe expertise of trial managers and the\ninspiration of PIs were highly valued. It was\ncommon for interviewees to describe the\ncontributions made by particular individuals. In\none trial, central trial team individuals had been\nchosen specifically to complement the profile and\nskills of the others, mindful of what this would\noffer to the local teams and their patients. The PI\ndescribed how the role of one, a doctor, was to\nbring on board fellow doctors through academic\nand shared professional appeal, and of the other,\nwho had a lot of experience in working with\nhealth professionals, was to act as a diplomat, to\n\u201ccharm\u201d patients and professionals alike. \nAdministration\nThe administrative workload for a trial can be\nextremely heavy, as demonstrated by each of the\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n43\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.Part B trials. This is especially the case where\ncentres require a high level of contact and\nsupport, as in the TOuCAN study and the\nELEVATE trial, or where there are many centres\ninvolved in recruitment. HPS faced a particular\nadministrative challenge, with a large number of\nrecruiting centres and a long timescale.\nInterviewees from the HPS centres commented on\nhow well thought out all trial procedures and\ndocumentation were, and how impressed they\nwere with the trial organisation. Careful planning\nand the development of strategies to manage the\nadministrative load involved in patient contact\nand recruitment were seen by some of the\nadministrative staff as essential for the trial. An\nimportant factor in this area of success, as with the\nFOCUS trial, appears to lie in the location of the\ntrial team within a larger professional clinical trials\nunit, centres with a reputation for expertise in the\nconduct of trials.\nAlthough there could be a lot of central assistance,\nsome of the administrative load, especially\nprovision of follow-up data, fell to the recruiting\ncentres, and this could cause difficulties. In one\nFOCUS trial centre, recruitment to the trial had\nslowed down as the backlog of data collection on\npreviously recruited participants had become\nunmanageable. For some months patients were\ntreated with standard care rather than recruited to\nthe trial to allow local staff to try to regain some\nadministrative ground. Funds gained locally from\nindustry and from R&D were used to fund nurses\nand data managers for the department, and one\nnurse was specifically appointed to address this\nbacklog. The centre was then able to pick up\nrecruitment without the concern of a high\nadministrative load building up. The difficulties\ncreated by this backlog were mentioned by several\ninterviewees. One nurse felt that this situation\nwould not have arisen for an industry-funded trial.\nShe argued that where nurses\u2019 salaries are funded\nby industry, there is an expectation that they will\nfulfil an obligation to meet data collection\nrequirements, and these are more stringent than\nin academic trials. It was felt that for academic\ntrials, stricter monitoring combined with\nappropriate support was desirable to keep busy\ncentres on track.\nMotivational strategies\nThe trials all used standard motivational\ntechniques such as newsletters, aide-m\u00e9moires and\ncompetitions for the highest recruiters. There were\ntwo approaches that seemed to be most effective,\naccording to the interviewees. The trials\ncommonly held meetings for professional\ncollaborators (HPS also held them for their\npatient participants), and these combined\neducational and social elements. They served to\nimprove interest in and knowledge of the trials\nand aimed to promote a sense of the trial\ncommunity. The trial team also often fed back\nrecruitment figures so that centres could compare\ntheir progress with that of others involved in the\ntrials. This could stir a competitive spirit,\nparticularly in larger recruiting centres with the\npotential to bring in more participants.\nSome of the motivational work was carried out\nlocally by those with a sense of investment or\nownership of the trial. The nurses who were\ninterviewed from the ELEVATE trial were well\nmotivated themselves and placed a lot of emphasis\non their own ability to influence ad hoc\nrecruitment. This could be by encouraging and\nreminding the GPs in their practice to be alert to\nthe eligibility criteria for the trial when they are\nconsulting patients, or it could be nurses checking\nrecords themselves. One nurse sent regular e-mails\nto her colleagues as reminders and described\nherself as \u201cprompting them the whole time\u201d. Even\nthough the majority of the patients enter the trial\nby way of the standard identification processes for\nthe trial, rather than through ad hoc recruitment,\nthe value of an enthusiastic nurse was appreciated\nby the trial teams.\nFor the TOuCAN study the success of the trial\ndepended entirely on the cooperation of the\nCAMHS professionals, and therefore much effort\nwas directed into promoting their participation,\nmaintaining the trial profile and trying to ensure\nthat referrals of new cases of anorexia nervosa\nwere not missed. There was a policy of frequent\ncontact and each team was telephoned on a\nmonthly basis to check for new referrals.\nNewsletters and other aide-m\u00e9moires (bookmarks,\npostcards and Christmas cards) were used, as well\nas an annual census of all cases of anorexia in\nwhich the teams were asked to state whether or not\nthey were referred to the trial. Practical assistance\nwith caseloads was also offered to promote\ninvolvement with the trial, in that those with a\nlong waiting list for clinical assessments could take\nup the option of passing over assessments to the\nEating Disorders Service at Chester. To maintain\ngood relations, the team observed a policy of\nalways providing prompt feedback on decisions\nabout participation and the allocated treatment to\nthe CAMHS team for each patient seen by the\nresearch team. This was mentioned as something\nthat was much appreciated by one of the CAMHS\ninterviewees. When new consultants join CAMHS\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n44teams, the trial staff make contact to establish a\nrelationship and to make sure that they are aware\nof the trial.\nCommon factors in the successes of the\nPart B trials\nThe four Part B trials have essential internal\ndifferences in their aims, settings and methods.\nDuring the course of the trials they have also been\nshaped by external factors, such as the NICE\nguidance on treatment for colorectal cancer\npatients for the FOCUS trial, and competition\nfrom another asthma drug trial for the ELEVATE\ntrial. Given their intrinsic and extrinsic\ndifferences, the identification of any possible\ncommon factors in their success may be useful in\nterms of the light shed on the running of other\nsimilar and dissimilar trials.\nThese factors are considered initially in two ways:\nfirst, an analysis of themes from the key stages\npresented above where the common factors cut\nacross at least three of the trials, and which appear\nto offer insights that may be used elsewhere; and\nsecond, from the responses of the interviewees to\nthe specific question that asked them to explain\nwhich factors they thought were the most\nsignificant in the success of their trial. These two\nmethods for considering factors in success are\nthen contrasted and compared. \nCommon factors in the successes of the Part B\ntrials based on analysis of themes identified in the\nkey stages\nAs might be expected, analysis of the themes\nshowed that success was thought to be related to\nthe clinical importance of the research question,\nand confidence that the trial design was\nscientifically sound. This appeared to be closely\nlinked to perceptions of the PIs, who were seen as\nresponsible for the design and direction of the\ntrials. They were respected not simply as high-\nprofile academics, but because they were, for\ninstance, \u201can OK bloke\u201d or \u201ca good doctor\u201d. They\nwere seen to have conviction and to be resolute;\none was thought to \u201cnever waiver\u201d in his\ncommitment to the design of the trial. \nIn addition to good-quality science and\nleadership, it was clear that the interviewees in all\nfour trials considered that the \u2018processes\u2019 involved\nwere key factors in the success of the trials. They\npointed to the considerable time and effort taken\nin getting the foundations for their trials well\nestablished, and felt that this was effective and\ntime well spent. This process of laying the\ngroundwork (although facilitated if there was a\npre-existing network of experienced trial\ncollaborators or an established trials office) helped\nto instil a strong sense of commitment to the trial,\nregardless of the original climate.\nAlthough the trials varied in their approach to the\nrecruitment processes, there was a common sense\nof their accommodation of the needs of potential\nrecruits, such that clinical collaborators felt able to\nfulfil their own sense of obligation to their\npatients, and that the trial was firmly grounded in\ntheir own clinical practice, and so may be useful in\ntheir practice after the trial. \nExpertise for the trials was fostered through\nvarious forms of training, and hence participants\ngenerally appeared to feel well informed. There\nwas appreciation from the collaborators that they\nwere protected from some of the workload\nassociated with involvement in a trial, for instance\nby having dedicated research nurses, and that\nresponsibilities within the trial were well\ndelineated within an efficient management system. \nThe interviewees identified themselves as part of a\nsuccessful, hard-working and motivated team, and\nthis feeling bred greater success and confidence,\nsuch that they were able to adapt to and overcome\neven serious problems such as funding crises and\nNICE pronouncements. What interviewees in all of\nthe trials seemed to be pointing to was a climate\nin which there was an important sense of\ncollectivity operating, where central teams and\ncollaborators were enthusiastic and keen to make\ntheir trials function well and to \u201cdeliver\u201d.\nFactors identified by respondents as the most\nsignificant for the success of their trials\nWhen, at the end of the interview, respondents\nwere asked what they felt were the key factors in\nthe success of their trials, they were not given a list\nof possible factors from which to select or any\nother form of direction or guidance. \nThe responses for each trial are shown in Boxes 1\u20134.\nIt should be borne in mind that the interviewees\nhad already talked about many aspects of the trial\nin the course of the interview and so may not have\nrepeated some of what they had already said was\nimportant for success. It was noticeable that\nalthough respondents from the central trial teams\ndid select some different features of their trial to\nmention, compared with local collaborators, there\nwas no evidence of strong disagreement within a\ntrial about the trial\u2019s success and the broad reasons\nfor that.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n45\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.Common factors identified by\nrespondents as the most significant for\nthe success of their trials\nIn their summing up, some features were\nmentioned by respondents across all four trials.\nThe most obvious were good communication\nbetween the centre and local collaborators and an\nefficient and responsive centre. In two of the four\ntrials (ELEVATE and TOuCAN) interviewees\ndescribed a close identification between the PIs\nand the collaborating clinicians. In TOuCAN the\nwork done by the PI in keeping in touch with local\nclinicians was specifically mentioned. In ELEVATE\nit was clearly very important for the participating\nGPs who were interviewed that the trial was\ndesigned and run by GPs. In a third trial, FOCUS,\na parallel set of comments was about the value of\ninvolvement with a respected trials unit and\napproval for the trial from NCRN. Another\nimportant common feature of these trials that was\nmentioned by interviewees was that they were\ndesigned to minimise the burden on local\ncollaborators (HPS, ELEVATE) or that\nparticipation had benefits for those who took part\n(ELEVATE, FOCUS, TOuCAN). Benefits included\nimproved local team working, access to training\nand meetings and benefits to patients (in\nELEVATE) because of extra attention to their\nasthma. \nThe importance, interest and timeliness of the\ntrial question were mentioned in three of the four\ntrials (not ELEVATE), and good design was\nmentioned in two. Specific design features that\nwere mentioned as encouraging clinicians or\npatients to take part included drugs not being\navailable outside the trial (FOCUS), NHS funding\nand contact through a GP legitimising the trial for\npatients (ELEVATE), and being able to say to\npatients that their GP approved in principle of an\napproach to them (in HPS).\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n46\n\u2022 Important\/interesting research question (\u00d72)\n\u2022 Good design, good protocol\n\u2022 Clinicians keen to recruit to trial\n\u2022 Drugs already tested so easier to explain to patients\n\u2022 Didn\u2019t demand extra effort from patients\n\u2022 No competing trials for those centres\/patients\n\u2022 Approval from NCRN\n\u2022 Centre accreditation\n\u2022 Drugs not available outside the trial (\u00d72)\n\u2022 Excellent trial management \n\u2022 Good communication between trial team and\nclinicians\n\u2022 Trials unit helpful, caring\n\u2022 Good public relations\/feedback\/updates\/information\nfor collaborators (\u00d75)\n\u2022 Annual meetings for all concerned\n\u2022 Trial steering group played an important role in\ndefending the trial\nBOX 1 FOCUS (comments from ten interviewees)\n\u2022 Good planning and organisation by CTSU \n\u2022 CTSU responsive, efficient\n\u2022 Central organisation of many aspects of the\nresearch\n\u2022 Minimising work for health professionals\n\u2022 Agreement in principle from GP to approach\npatients\n\u2022 Prior screening to make sure patients were eligible\n(\u00d72)\n\u2022 Important question, timely and managed to roll\nseveral questions into one study\nBOX 4 HPS (comments from six interviewees)\n\u2022 Flexibility of trial team and flexibility allowed to\npractices (\u00d73)\n\u2022 GPs involved in design (academic GPs) and practical\nside (active GPs)\n\u2022 Trial team able to see things from GP perspective \n\u2022 Pragmatic study\n\u2022 Good design\n\u2022 Good funding\n\u2022 Practices not \u2018researched out\u2019 already; not too\nstressed; enough willing to take part (\u00d73)\n\u2022 PI well respected\n\u2022 Trial run by good team, good infrastructure (\u00d73)\n\u2022 Trial team communicative, responsive and alert to\nproblems (\u00d73)\n\u2022 NHS funding and contact through GP legitimise the\ntrial for patients\n\u2022 Patients have done well with their asthma control\n\u2022 Impact on practice running and costs was minimised\n(\u00d72)\n\u2022 Role of research nurse\nBOX 2 ELEVATE (comments from 12 interviewees)\n\u2022 Communication within team and between team and\ncollaborating clinicians (\u00d77)\n\u2022 PIs worked hard to keep collaborators on board\n(\u00d73)\n\u2022 Topic important, urgent need for research (\u00d72)\n\u2022 Trial good for local staff because it gave them\ntraining, motivated them and improved their\nworking relationships (\u00d74)\n\u2022 Good trial team, responsive, good research\nassistants (\u00d74)\n\u2022 Study included everybody\n\u2022 Team worked hard at how to explain the study to\npatients\nBOX 3 TOuCAN (comments from ten interviewees)Common factors in the successes of the\nPart B trials: summary\nCommon factors emerged both from analysis of\nthe broader interviews and from the specific\nsummary question. \nFrom both sources it was clear that a key \nfeature was the importance and timeliness of a\nresearch question that had the potential to lead \nto real changes in practice. Alongside this was a\nview that a trial design that put respect for the\nneeds of patients and the clinical professionals\nwithin the trial at its centre was likely to be\nsuccessful. \nThese were seen as necessary but not sufficient\nconditions. Respondents also saw the leadership\nrole of the PIs as crucial, particularly in terms of\ntheir standing in the clinical community. However,\nthey all recognised that the clinical leader needed\nto be backed by a strong and efficient coordinating\nteam, which was able to take much of the weight of\nparticipation in the trial off the hands of busy\nclinicians, and yet use excellent communication\nskills to keep all the collaborators on board, well\ninformed and enthusiastic ambassadors for \u2018their\u2019\ntrial. \nDiscussion\nThis component of STEPS has complemented \nthe approach from Part A. Rather than using a\nquantitative approach working with\ndocumentation provided for a large number of\ntrials, four trials were looked at in more detail\nusing a qualitative approach. Chapter 5 \ncompares and contrasts the findings from the\nthree STEPS parts. In the rest of this chapter, the\nconclusions of Part B are discussed in the context\nof the strengths of this method and also its\nlimitations.\nThe available literature is large and complicated\nwith a lot of methodological variation, but it does\npoint to a number of potential barriers to\nrecruitment for professionals. The data from the\ninterviews described the efforts that teams in these\nexemplar trials made to address, adapt to,\nmitigate and even prevent the effects of these\npotential obstacles from affecting recruitment\nrates. It may have been significant that these trials\nwere not simple and easy trials, but faced\nconsiderable challenges. Where the larger trial\nteams were aware of the difficulties inherent or the\nobstacles overcome, this seemed to increase\nrespect and motivation. \nA specific aim of this research was to gain insights\ninto facilitators to recruitment that are likely to be\nrelevant to trials in general. Interviewing\nindividuals in several trial centres with a wide\nrange of responsibilities, and the exploration of\nkey stages for the four Part B trials, suggested a\nnumber of factors that seemed to offer useful\nlessons and that might be replicable. The\ninterview process itself conveyed something of the\nculture of each trial and offered the opportunity\nfor insight and reflection. \nThe common key factors identified by the\ninterviewees suggested that high research\nstandards are extremely influential in their\nexperiences. This would make sense because if\nresearchers and collaborators are to invest their\ntime and effort, not to mention exposing patients\nto a trial, then they need to feel confident and\nmotivated and that a trial is \u2018morally right\u2019 to\noffer. The discussions for this study suggested that\nhigh research standards were, however, greater\nthan simply a good question or a scientifically\nrobust design. Professionals appeared to be most\nenthused by a sense of contributing to research\nthat they perceived as having the potential to\nchange their clinical world, and that was sensitive\nto the needs of patients and professionals alike.\nThe PIs were highly important, as inspirational\nfigures at central and local levels. \nThese trials also showed how much attention they\npaid to getting the foundations right. To the\nauthors\u2019 knowledge this aspect of trials\nmanagement, and the contribution that it makes\nto subsequent recruitment, has not been previously\ndescribed in the empirical literature. \nThe various factors explored here may be tightly\ninterrelated, and what is expressed in forms such\nas \u201ca good team\u201d, \u201chard work\u201d, \u201cgood\ncommunication\u201d and \u201corganisation\u201d do tap in to a\nmore general ethos, a spirit of enquiry carried out\nwith a high degree of professionalism. Indeed, this\nwas evident in the often striking degree of\ncooperation offered to the researcher. This sense\nof dynamism, clarity and efficiency extended to\nthe conduct and content of the interviews. There\nwere strict time constraints for Part B and so\nrequests were often made with a degree of\nurgency. They were met with prompt and efficient\nreplies to queries and provision of comprehensive\nand clear trial material. Some trial managers went\nto considerable lengths, writing long e-mails to\nensure that the relevant issues for their trials were\nmade clear. Not only did the interviewees give of\ntheir time, it was clear that many were deeply\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n47\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.committed to their research, as reflected in their\npatient descriptions and enthusiastic engagement\nin the issues raised in interview. Although it is\ndifficult to quantify the impact of this quality of\ncommitment on recruitment, it is likely that a\nculture of motivation, responsiveness and\ncommitment that prevails at different levels, both\ncentrally and locally, will be a positive force and a\ncontributory factor in the success of a trial.\nThe conclusions from these interviews must be\ntentative. This study focused on a small number of\ntrials and although these covered a range of\nspecialities, interventions and trial designs, it is\nlikely that more might be learned by extending\nthese interviews to a larger number of more\ndiverse trials. The authors chose to concentrate on\nexemplars and these particular trials were\nsuggested to them by the funders. If we had,\ninstead, chosen trials that had achieved their\ntarget recruitment within the originally agreed\ntime-frame, further insights might have been\ngained.\nThe interviews elicited perceptions of the reasons\nfor the success of the Part B trials. It is plausible,\nhowever, that if interviews had also been\nconducted with teams within trials that were not\nexemplars in either sense, the study might have\nfound similar factors operating. \nHowever, it was clear from the interviewees that\nthey did see themselves as members of successful\nteams. The ways in which trials are organised and\nhow teams operate are ripe for further research\nand are explored in the next chapter.\nCase studies of trials that appeared to have particularly interesting lessons for recruitment \n48Introduction\nThe in-depth case studies of four trials in Chapter\n3 suggested that management and teamwork play\nimportant roles in a successful trial. However,\nmany, perhaps most, clinical trials are devised,\nmanaged and reviewed by clinicians and allied\nprofessionals only. This is not surprising since the\npurpose of a trial is to advance clinical practice.\nHowever, could it be that conducting a successful\nclinical trial requires activities that disciplines\nother than medicine are best suited to deliver? In\nthis chapter it is suggested that clinical trials can\nbe seen as businesses and that the disciplines of\nbusiness management may be relevant to those\nwho conduct clinical trials.\nBusinesses find customers and convince them to\nbuy what is on offer. Clinical trials find doctors\nand patients and convince them to sign up. They\nthus appear to face similar challenges and may\nneed to install similar processes. Clinical trials are\nnot necessarily akin only to small businesses; \nsome can be viewed as equivalent to quite large\nbusinesses with revenues running into millions of\npounds and recruitment targets of thousands of\nparticipants.\nClinical trials have several stages, including\ndesigning the trial, obtaining funding, finding\nparticipants, processing results, interpreting the\nresults and reporting the findings. In all stages the\nkey requirement is to \u2018do good science\u2019. However,\nin the recruitment stage the most demanding\nactivity is to install and operate a range of\neffective management techniques, which parallel\nthose for running a successful business. This\npresents new challenges that require a very\ndifferent set of competencies to those related to\nfulfilling the scientific mission of the trial.\nManagement and marketing\nThe modern study of management began with\nFrederick Winslow Taylor before the First World\nWar.77 Taylor realised that effective management\nrequires a clear set of values, incisive analytical\ntechniques, evidence-based approaches, and the\nuse of specially devised methods for control and\ncoordination. For the purposes of this chapter,\nmanagement is defined as \u2018getting complex things\ndone efficiently and effectively\u2019. Taylor became\nknown as \u2018the father of Scientific Management\u2019\nand many empirical and theoretical contributions\nsince then have taken the study and practice of\nmanagement forward greatly. Since the 1970s,\nmanagement has become a legitimate academic\nstudy, with most universities offering Master of\nBusiness Administration (MBA) degrees and\ndoctoral programmes.\nSome, but not all, managers run businesses. A\nbusiness exists because it finds customers and\nfulfils their needs, with its costs being lower than\nthe revenue that it receives. A business needs to be\nentrepreneurial, not least because other businesses\ncompete with it and attempt to capture its\ncustomers. There are special management\nchallenges in running businesses78 that will be\nelaborated upon later in this chapter.\nAn aspect of management that has developed\nmarkedly over the past 20 years deals with \u2018big\npicture\u2019 questions such as \u2018what should we be\ndoing?\u2019 and \u2018what resources will we need?\u2019\nQuestions such as these are answered by senior\nmanagers and the field that guides them is known\nas strategic management. Strategy is constructed\nas decisions are taken about why the organisation\nexists (its mission), what it aims to do (vision and\ngoals), its capabilities (core competencies) and its\nguiding principles (values).\nAn important speciality within management is\nmarketing, which is the study of what is needed to\nwin and retain customers. Like management,\nmarketing has distinctive frameworks, methods\nand techniques, many drawn from the social\nsciences such as sociology and social psychology.\nSince marketing became better understood in the\n1960s79 it has become ubiquitous with almost\nevery large company, and many not-for-profit\norganisations, having a director of marketing and\na marketing department. The key tasks of a\nmarketing function are to define the\ncharacteristics of customer groups (market\nsegments), to devise ways to signal the benefits of\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n49\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Clinical trials need people to buy in; hence,\nfor all trials, marketing is fundamental. Trialists\ncannot avoid being marketers.\nA definition of marketing offered by McDonald and\nWilson80 is \u201ca process for defining markets,\nquantifying the needs of the customer groups\n(segments) within these markets, determining the\nvalue proposition to meet these needs,\ncommunicating these value propositions to all those\npeople in the organisation responsible for\ndelivering them and getting their buy-in to their\nrole, playing an appropriate part in delivering these\nvalue propositions to the chosen market segments\n(and) monitoring the value actually delivered\u201d. (A\nvalue proposition is a bundle of benefits offered\nthat impels a customer to want to buy. For example,\nthe value proposition for a family car may include\nenhanced safety cots for babies, children\u2019s\nentertainment in the back seats, ample space and\nstain-proof upholstery. One of these benefits, by\nitself, will be unlikely to persuade parents to buy.\nTaken together, the value proposition offered by the\nmotor manufacturer may be sufficient to impel a\ncustomer to want to buy.)\nMcDonald and Wilson\u2019s definition concentrates on\ndeveloping processes that provide an offer that\ncustomers consider to be of value. In short, it\nfocuses on the need to have customers pulling the\norganisation to deliver something that they want.\nThis is the opposite of the conventional view that\nmarketing is about pushing products or services\nthat the organisation wants to sell. It can be\nargued that pushing a product is a sales, not\nmarketing, activity.\nAn initial survey of the literature on clinical trials\nshows that the marketing dimension is included\ntangentially in many trials.39 For example, trials\nare generally stated to need recruitment strategies,\nuse of media and data tracking systems. However,\nthe notion of developing and working to achieve a\nformal marketing plan that covers all of the areas\nin the McDonald and Wilson80 definition is absent\nfrom all the trial management descriptions\nexamined here.\nThis is not to suggest that clinical trial managers\nconsider the topic of recruitment lightly. Indeed, it\nis the dominant preoccupation of many trialists.\nFor example, the Diabetic Retinopathy Awareness\nProgram study81 undertook many initiatives to\nrecruit volunteers and concluded that \u201cthese\nexperiences substantiate the need for a\ncomprehensive coordinated approach, using\nplanned sources, to achieve recruitment success\u201d.\nWhen looked at from a business management\nperspective, it is clear that dimensions of running\na successful trial include marketing, sales and\nongoing client management. It can be argued that\nmarketing is especially important in clinical trials\nsince, in most cases, those who need to be enrolled\nto support clinical trials are volunteers who may\ngain no benefits from participation and can be\nasked to undertake activities without reward to\nthemselves. Participation in a trial is a formal\nvoluntary act, in that participants need to abide by\na set of rules. Accordingly, not only is it necessary\nfor people to volunteer, but they also need to sign\nup to behave in accordance with a procedure.82 It\nhas been suggested83 that \u201ccompetitive pressures\nmake careful applications of marketing\nmanagement tools imperative for the survival of\ntime-dependent (i.e. working to time-based\ntargets) non-profit organizations\u201d. This point was\nelaborated in the following observation by the\ndirector of investigation services at a contract\nresearch company, who observed that \u201cnowadays,\nrecruitment is more complex and so there are\nincreasing requirements around raising awareness\nwith patients\u201d.84\nFrom a marketing perspective, conducting a\nsuccessful trial can be seen as a process with five\nmain stages (Figure 2). These five subprocesses\nfollow McDonald and Wilson\u2019s definition (cited\nabove), but elaborate it significantly. Table 16\namplifies the purposes and content of each of the\nstages.\nRelated to, but distinct from, marketing are sales\nactivities. Selling is a set of activities intended to\npersuade a potential customer to buy. Selling\nrequires specialised skills, a persuasive case and\nthe capacity to empathise with potential\ncustomers. Often selling is a face-to-face activity,\nbut it need not be so. It is possible to sell through\nthe Internet, by telephone, through word-of-\nmouth, by advertising, and so on. It is considered\nby some that selling is a base and manipulative\nactivity. Although this can be true, selling is often\na mechanism for relating a customer\u2019s needs to\nproducts or services that are available. Many\ndoctors, for example, spend part of their time\nselling the benefits of leading a healthier lifestyle.\nThe clinical trial as a business: a single, in-depth case study of a large multicentre trial\n50Clinical trials require strategy, management,\nmarketing and sales. Undoubtedly they undertake\nall of these activities in some way. It is possible,\nhowever, that those who define the strategy of a\ntrial, establish its management processes, devise its\nmarketing plan and attempt to sell the benefits of\nparticipation may improve their practice by\nexplicitly engaging with the discipline of\nmanagement. Indeed, Farrell85 has argued\npersuasively that it is a lack of solutions to\nmanagerial issues that reduces the effectiveness of\ntrials, and Rowe and colleagues86 suggested that\n\u201cto get patients into trials more efficiently pharma\ncompanies must begin to think like marketers\u201d. \nOf particular importance is the need to segment\nthe market. This requires identifying and listing\nthe key characteristics of different target\naudiences. (It should be noted that a disadvantage\nof selecting the CRASH trial for the in-depth case\nstudy was that for this patient population the\naspect of participant engagement could not be\nexplored.) To some extent each will require a\ndistinctive marketing strategy. Market segments\nvary according to the nature of the trial but,\ntypically, there will be at least five: the potential\nparticipants, their relatives, the potential\nrecruiting doctors, senior consultants and nurses\n(who play a key role in many cases). It may also be\nnecessary to have a marketing strategy for the\nbroader medical community, including opinion\nleaders who may be crucial to the success of the\ntrial. In addition, it may be necessary to \u2018sell\u2019 the\ntrials to R&D departments and other groups that\nimpact on the feasibility and therefore success of\nthe trial.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n51\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The CRASH trial is a large-scale, placebo-\ncontrolled trial on the effect of corticosteroid\ntreatment on death and disability in patients with\nhead injury. The trial aimed to recruit close to\n20,000 head-injured patients from hospitals\nworldwide. Because all of the patients included in\nthe trial were unconscious and thus unable to give\ninformed consent, the relevant MRECs and\nLRECs had in most cases agreed that the\nresponsible doctor could take the decision to enter\na patient into the trial. For this reason the main\nchallenge in conducting the trial was to engage\nthe interest and collaboration of doctors who treat\npatients with head injury.\nDF was given access to all trial related documents\n(apart from confidential patient outcome data)\nand interviewed the members of the central trial\nmanagement team. He visited three participating\nhospitals in England, observed training sessions\nand interviewed or facilitated group discussions\nwith doctors (12), nurses (14) and ancillary staff\n(four).\nDF\u2019s interview notes were analysed using N-Vivo\nqualitative analysis software initially, but manual\nanalytical methods were used later as a significant\nresearch objective was to highlight what\nparticipating agents were not saying, rather than\nwhat they were saying. The researcher invited a\nprofessor of management to check his\ninterpretative framework against the raw data. He\npresented his findings to the STEPS research team\nand also to researchers at the Centre for Research\nin Innovation Management. Exposing an\nemerging conceptual model to experienced\nacademic researchers, trialists and trial managers\nprovided an opportunity to validate the\nresearcher\u2019s constructs and extended the theory\nbuilding process.\nUsing grounded theory87 a reference model was\ndeveloped that could be used to assess the sales\nand marketing capability of the trial. A one-day\nmarketing workshop using an action research\napproach was held with the trial team to provide\ninsights into the extent to which concepts and\npractices from the business world might have\nrelevance to management of clinical trials. Early in\n2004 an additional 5-hour workshop was held with\nrepresentatives from five trials (one of which was\nthe CRASH trial) to gain further insight into the\nheuristic value of the reference model.\nProcesses for testing the reference model, using an\naction research method, with the full-time staff\nconducting the CRASH trial provided additional,\nalthough case-specific, data. For example, a one-\nday workshop was held on the strategy of the\nCRASH trial. \nIn the trial documentation (a form of business\nplan) it was stated that the aims of the trial were to\ndeliver a certain number of cases by a certain\ntime. In the workshop this statement of goals was\nelaborated and it was agreed that the mission of\nthe CRASH team was \u201cto answer an important\nscientific question thereby providing clinicians\nwith evidence-based knowledge that will help\nthem to treat head injury patients better by:\n\u25cf efficiently and effectively conducting the world\u2019s\nlargest head injury study;\n\u25cf recruiting and following up 20,000 patients by\n2006;\n\u25cf ensuring that the evidence collected and\nconclusions drawn meet the highest standards\nof medical and scientific practice.\u201d\nAt the same workshop, eight core values were\nagreed upon:\n1. We maintain the highest ethical standards:\nmaintaining confidentiality and abiding by the\nbest medical practice.\n2. We ensure that data are reliable, valid and\nverifiable.\n3. We build quality into every activity and into our\nsystem as a whole: \u2018quality before quantity\u2019.\n4. We are unique, innovative and original: seeking\nnew ideas and using them to benefit the trial.\n5. We are efficient (fast, cost-effective and error\nfree).\n6. We are a collaborative organisation: serving the\nneeds of all partners and stakeholders.\n7. We communicate effectively, openly and fully.\n8. We are people-orientated: personal and caring.\nThe mission and core values elaborated the goals\nof the CRASH trial, humanised its tasks and\ndefined ground-rules or collective norms. From\nThe clinical trial as a business: a single, in-depth case study of a large multicentre trial\n52this and other action research interventions it\nproved possible to assess how a trial management\ngroup responded to interventions more commonly\nused in commercial organisations.\nResults\nThe researchers considered that it would be\nimpossible to audit the managerial effectiveness of\na trial without templates of what a well-managed\ntrial was like. Accordingly, the results presented in\nthis section are models, not findings. Later\nresearch can test the models and use them as audit\ntools.\nTwo models will be presented. The first is\nsystemic, dealing with the management issues for\na trial as a whole. The second, and more detailed,\nmodel examines marketing and sales issues for\nclinical trials, since these were the areas studied\nintensively in the CRASH study.\nA tentative systemic model\nSince the 1970s, management studies have\nemphasised that organisations need to be seen as\nsystems with interacting activities.88 The\nperformance of the system as a whole depends, at\nleast in part, on the appropriateness of the\nactivities to the performance of the system as a\nwhole, the efficiency by which the activities are\nperformed and, crucially, how the activities relate\ntogether to form a gestalt, or whole.89 An example\nillustrates the point. In a busy primary care\npractice it may be that the clinical activities could\nbe conducted efficiently as there are sufficient\nnumbers of trained doctors available. However, if\nsystems for scheduling the doctors\u2019 workloads are\nslow and prone to error the performance of the\npractice as a system will be degraded.\nA clinical trial requires a sequence of activities to\nbe completed. Within each activity category many\nspecific activities generally take place. In\nmanagement jargon this is known as a value chain,\nsince each of the activities should create value (i.e.\nprovide benefits for one or more of the\nstakeholders). The activities listed in a value chain\ndiagram are very broad in scope, for example,\n\u2018operations\u2019 would be regarded as \u2018an activity\u2019. (In\nmanagement jargon, \u2018operations\u2019 means the work\nneeded to turn raw materials into finished\nproducts. In a factory, \u2018operations\u2019 is the work that\nneeds to be done, for example, to turn planks of\nwood into furniture; in an insurance office\n\u2018operations\u2019 includes work that needs to be done\nto turn an enquiry into a proposal. In a hospital,\n\u2018operations\u2019 is the work that needs to be done to\ncare for patients.) Accordingly, the effectiveness of\nthe trial is a consequence of the degree to which\neach set of activities is appropriate and performed\nwell, and the activities are integrated together.90\nSome activities are core, in that they directly\nsupport trial effectiveness. Other activities are\nsupport, in that they are necessary but do not\ndirectly add value to trial performance.\nThe researchers were unable to find a systemic or\nvalue chain model of a clinical trial in the\nliterature and so to understand better the specific\nmanagement issues of a trial a speculative value\nchain model was developed (Figure 3). The arrow\nlayout is the conventional format used in\nmanagement analysis. This diagram shows the\nrelationship between the key sets of activities that\ndeliver value to clinical knowledge. There are six\ncore activities, shown in the centre of the arrow\ndiagram, and four non-core activities that enable\nthe core activities to be performed. The core\nactivities are likely to be understood, but the value\nadded by non-core activities is less obvious. This\nstudy found that it was vital for a trial to win\nsupport from the multiple stakeholders, have\nstrong norms and processes for undertaking \u2018good\nscience\u2019, be able to manage all of the soft and hard\nactivities involved in managing a complex project\nand, lastly, to ensure that funds were spent well\nand that expenditure was tracked.\nThe extent to which a trial delivers its promise \nwill be determined by the efficiency and\neffectiveness by which the ten activities of the\nvalue chain are performed and the degree of\nintegration between them. It is to be expected that\nthe construction of a value chain for a clinical trial\nwill differ to some extent according to its specific\nrequirements. It is emphasised that sales and\nmarketing are limited management activities.\nSimply getting sales and marketing right will not\nbe sufficient.\nWorkshops held with the CRASH trial team found\nthat there was a need to upgrade systemic\nthinking. Each person working on the trial had\ntheir area of responsibility, but issues that crossed\norganisational boundaries were discussed less and\nwere identified as problematic. Each activity in the\nvalue chain presented a distinct management\nchallenge. For example, in the CRASH trial many\nparticipating hospitals were overseas and there was\na need to travel extensively to gain stakeholder\nsupport and use web-based communication\nmethods to maintain communication and\ncommitment.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n53\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.A marketing and sales reference model\nfor trials\nThe marketing challenge facing the CRASH trial\nteam is different to that of a company that is\nselling soap or offering package holidays. When\ncompanies sell a product they attempt to convince\na potential customer that they will gain benefits\ndirectly from their purchase. In CRASH the trial\nmanagers were seeking to gain a commitment to\nengage from clinical professionals who would\nmake no material gain for themselves.\nAccordingly, the CRASH trial was selling an\nopportunity for clinical professionals to participate\nin improving future clinical practice, an activity\nthat can be seen as being akin to a charitable\nendeavour.82 A challenge for the CRASH trial was\nto sell the notion that if a clinician signed up to\nthe trial then medicine itself would progress and\nthe clinician would be fulfilling a professional\nobligation.\nThe complex nature of the sale [of a trial that\nrequires the participation of staff in accident and\nemergency (A&E) departments] is illustrated by\nthe comments in Box 5.\nAnother dimension of the marketing challenge\nwas found to be the difficulty in understanding the\nreasons why participants (in this case hospitals)\nsigned up and what motivated them to fulfil a\ncommitment that had no sanctions for \nnon-performance.91 An analysis of feedback from\nparticipating hospitals concluded that they opted\nin for a variety of reasons, including the perceived\nmerits of the study, the efficacy of the sponsors\nand advocates, the status provided to participants\nthrough participation and the affordability of\nparticipation (see section IIa of Figure 4).\nThe clinical trial as a business: a single, in-depth case study of a large multicentre trial\n54\nDesigning\nthe trial\nand\nacquiring\nfunding\nInstalling\ntrial\nmanagement\nprocesses\nFinding and\nenrolling\nparticipants\nAcquiring\nand\nprocessing\ndata\nDeveloping\nvalid\nconclusions\nPublishing and\ndisseminating\nGaining stakeholder support\nMaintaining scientific standards\nPractising project management\nMaintaining financial disciplines\nP\nroviding value to medical knowledge\nFIGURE 3 Value chain model\n\u2022 Enrolment happens by word of mouth.

Many of the attitudes, concepts and\npractices of modern marketing had already been\nadopted. Indeed, the trial manager made the\ncomment in an early interview that \u201cit\u2019s all about\nselling\u201d. However, the trial team was unaware that\nthey were using, at least in part, a distinctive\nconceptual framework developed in the business\nworld; to them it was common sense. Perhaps\nbecause the CRASH team\u2019s marketing approach\nwas self-invented, some practices were state of the\nart, whereas others were weak or absent. \nWorking with the CRASH trial team, DF sought to\nanswer the question, \u2018if this was a business, then\nwhat policies, practices and capabilities would be\nneeded for the marketing challenges to be met?\u2019 \nA reference model was developed to define the\ncapabilities required for each of these stages\n(Figure 4) that offered a systemic ideal type, that\nthe trial could use to define excellence.92 The\nmodel has four domains and 12 components and\nis illustrated as a wheel diagram. The components\nand their relevance to the CRASH trial are\noutlined below. \nThe wheel diagram could be used as the\nframework for an auditing tool. The management\nteam conducting the CRASH trial assessed the\ncomponents\u2019 effectiveness and efficiency in\nrelation to each of the 12 components and\nillustrated these as a spider chart on the diagram.\nSince all of the components are important, it was\nassumed that higher scoring components\nrepresent strengths that should be amplified93 and\nlower scoring components are blockages to be\nreduced or eliminated.94\nThe 12 components are described below, with\ncomments on performance of the CRASH trial\nrelated to each dimension.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n55\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Developing brand values\nBrand values define what a brand is and what it is\nnot; that is, its personality. A clinical trial can be\nseen as a brand. Without explicit brand values it is\nimpossible to communicate a coherent and\npersuasive perception of a trial\u2019s promise: what the\ntrial intends to deliver to medicine, doctors,\npatients, and so on. CRASH had developed strong\nbrand values, including scientific rigour,\ninclusiveness, simplicity and high levels of\nfeedback to participants.\nIb. Gaining legitimacy and prestige\nTrials need legitimacy: they need to be positively\ntagged by association with prestigious individuals\nand institutions (so a hospital doctor may say, \u201cI\nknow that this is an important trial because\nProfessor X, whom I know and respect, is\nsupporting it\u201d). Legitimacy and prestige provide\npersuasive credibility, which is key to gaining\naccess to decision-makers. CRASH benefited\ngreatly from the public support of leading\nauthorities, notably the MRC, the CTSU at the\nUniversity of Oxford and respected academics.\nHowever, an assessment of the extent to which the\nCRASH trial had acquired a full portfolio of\nlegitimatising agents identified that one important\nspeciality (neurosurgeons) had never been won\nover, and disadvantaged the trial\u2019s persuasive\ncredibility. This legitimacy gap is now being\naddressed.\nIc. Signalling worthiness\nIt is vital to signal to likely participants that this\ntrial will create greater value than the costs (time,\neffort or money) involved. Buy-in is more likely to\noccur when participants realise, and identify with,\nthe potential benefits that will be delivered by the\nsuccess of the trial. CRASH made great efforts to\nsignal its worthiness, especially through\npresentations at conferences, journal publications,\nadvertising, public relations and training\nmaterials. Anecdotally, it was considered that these\nsignalling activities had been successful, but no\nprocedures were in place to gather data\nsystematically on the extent to which the trial had\nachieved an adequate share of voice (i.e. the trial\nwas known to potential participants).\nIIa. Providing simple, complete processes\nTrials require participants to undertake additional\nwork. Providing simple, complete processes\nreduces the costs of participation and increases the\nchances that involvement will be affordable.\nCRASH had developed streamlined processes that\nwere piloted and improved frequently. However,\nsome difficulties remained. For example, trial\ntreatment packs for overseas participants are often\nheld by overseas customs, requiring considerable\neffort from trial collaborators to release them.\nAlso, filling in data forms and sending them to the\ntrial office could involve substantial work.\nAlthough the trial team developed better methods\nfor data collection, they were not in place at the\nstart of the trial. During 2003 processes were\nsimplified further with improved online input.\nIIb. Devising strategies for overcoming resistance\nPotential participants frequently raise objections\n(Box 6). It is likely that other trials will have\ndifferent perceptions and resistances. An effective\nmarketing plan will deal with the existential reality\nof each of the targeted groups, not bundle them\ntogether into a generalised marketing\/sales plan.\nTrials should have standard and persuasive\nanswers to these. Having a persuasive answer for\neach objection increases the probability of making\na sale. CRASH has a list of answers to frequently\nasked questions, but the team could do more to\ndeal with unspecific resistance, for example,\npotential participants saying \u201cit\u2019s a good trial but\nwe just don\u2019t have the time\u201d. Again, work is\nunderway to improve the capacity of the trial staff\nto provide accurate, speedy and persuasive\nanswers to objections.\nIIc. Adopting an explicit marketing plan\nThe marketing of a trial is too important and too\ncomplicated to be done informally.

It can put you\noff doing it again\nBOX 6 Potential participants\u2019 objectionsmarketing plan is required that should include a\ndefinition of target market segments (groups that\nneed to buy in to the trial) and the trial\u2019s unique\nselling points. It is to be expected that the\nmarketing plan will need to be revised frequently,\nprobably every quarter. CRASH did not have a\nwritten marketing plan until this study was\nundertaken. The trial team had already\nappreciated that a major market for the trial\ncomprised hospitals in countries that had high\nrates of head injuries, and identified nine\nsegments: opinion leaders (national\/international)\nin neurosurgeons, intensivists, A&E specialists, A&E\nnurses, hospital administrators, registrars, ethics\ncommittees, government health departments and\ndrug manufacturers. Each of these segments\nneeded a distinctive marketing and sales plan.\nA formal marketing plan identified the need for\nadditional resources to be allocated to winning\nparticipation from such hospitals. The CRASH\nteam later identified five levels of commitment to\nthe project by potential participants and defined\nstrategies for each. The levels and strategies were:\n(1) the uninformed (inform and persuade with\ntargeted stories); (2) the unconvinced (address\nconcerns point-by-point; get to yes); (3) the\nlaggards (enrol, cajole, facilitate and target); \n(4) the steady performers (reward, renew, upgrade\nand recognise); and (5) the stars (honour, learn\nfrom, exploit and nourish).\nIIIa. Engaging active sponsors, champions and\nchange agents\nSelling a trial to prospective participants requires\npersuasion. This requires enrolling sponsors\n(public advocates), champions (activists) and\nchange agents (facilitators). Trial managers need a\nnetwork of supporters to spread the message.\nPersuasion is more likely to occur if the advocate is\nrespected and known personally to the prospective\nparticipant. CRASH had enrolled sponsors and\nsought to encourage champions. However,\nperformance was patchy. Increased recognition of\nthe importance of this activity has meant that the\nCRASH team is now making systematic efforts to\ndevelop stronger networks of direct influence.\nIIIb. Delivering a multiaudience, multilevel\nmessage\nTrials need to convey sales messages through\npublicity, presentations, training materials, and so\non. These should be tuned to the distinctive needs\nof target groups; for example, surgeons are likely\nto be persuaded by different messages to\nadministrators or nursing staff. Speaking in the\nlanguage of the person being targeted and\naddressing their particular pattern of motivation is\nmore likely to succeed than a one size fits all\napproach. CRASH had gone some way to\ndeveloping distinctive ways to communicate with\nits intended audiences, but this was insufficient\nand the communication was generic, not\nsegmented. Currently, work is underway to refine\nfurther the communication strategy using the\nnotion of micromarketing (i.e. tuning messages to\nthe specific needs of market segments).\nIIIc. Achieving buy-in (in public)\nPublic buy-in requires that intended participants\nannounce their commitment to join the trial in a\nsetting where they are heard by others. This is\nimportant because when someone states, in public,\nthat they are willing to undertake an action, then\nthey are much more likely to abide by their\ncommitment than if they take a silent decision,\nwhich can be forgotten easily. CRASH has\nachieved a measure of encouraging and\nreinforcing buy-in, for example by naming new\nparticipants in its regular newsletter. However,\nmore can be done and strategies are being\ndeveloped to achieve more complete and\nmemorable buy-in moments.\nIVa. Ensuring positive moments of truth\nPeople evaluate organisations (including trial\nmanagement teams) on the basis of their\nexperiences at moments of truth. For example, if a\ndoctor has a technical question about entering a\npatient into a trial he or she will gain a strong\nimpression of the trial management team\u2019s\ncompetence by the way in which the query is\nhandled. If an organisation behaves well in a\nmoment of truth then loyalty grows; if not, loyalty\ndiminishes. A core value of the CRASH trial was to\nbe user-friendly and this meant that the trial team\ntried to be helpful on all occasions. However,\npotential moments of truth had not been\nidentified systematically and work is underway to\nunderstand better the key moments when\nparticipants come to define the CRASH trial; for\ngood or ill. Once this assessment has been\ncompleted it will be possible to improve the way in\nwhich moments of truth are handled.\nIVb. Providing frequent positive reinforcement\nPositive reinforcement for existing participants\nshould be an important part of a trial\u2019s participant\nretention strategy. It is more expensive to recruit\nnew participants than to retain existing\nparticipants. CRASH had gone some way towards\nrecognising and rewarding participants, but its\nstrategy was to honour the highest yielding\nhospitals, which could be a disincentive to those\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n57\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.whose contribution to the trial was more modest.\nIn 2003, the policy was changed so as to give\npositive reinforcement to all contributors.\nIVc. Facilitating incorporation into routines\nActivities that become embedded as routines are\nmore likely to be done than one-offs. Trial\nprocedures should be incorporated into the\nroutines of units undertaking the work. CRASH\nhad incorporated this principle into the\ndevelopment of its training materials, but did not\nemphasise it. More can be done to embed CRASH\nas a standard operating procedure in hospitals,\nand this is being addressed.\nDiscussion\nStatement of principal findings\nFarrell, among others, has been arguing for a\ngreater recognition of the role of management in\nthe conduct of clinical trials,85 but without spelling\nout what this means in detail. This study has\nfound that it is possible to construct useful\nreference models that assess the managerial\ncapability of a trial, both as a totality and in\nrelation to marketing and sales activities.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the study\nThe key strength of this study is that, to the\nauthors\u2019 knowledge, for the first time in academic\nliterature, it provides two models that give a\nconceptual architecture that provides an\nopportunity for trial managers to review their\nstrategic, managerial and\/or marketing strengths\nand weaknesses.95\nThe weaknesses of this study are that it was based\non a single case, that tests to prove the validity of\nthe models were rudimentary, and it has not been\npossible to compare trials that use the reference\nmodel approach with trials that do not use it.\nAlthough the researchers consider that there are\nconsiderable benefits in reflecting on trials from a\nbusiness perspective, it is important to emphasise\nthat they are not businesses. Management and\nmarketing provide frameworks and tools that can\nimprove the probability that a trial will achieve its\nscientific goals. However, it would be damaging if\nan interest in developing trials as \u2018businesses\u2019 led to\nseparation of the scientific aspects and trial\nmanagement processes. As mentioned above (see\nthe section \u2018Management and marketing\u2019, p. 49),\nparticipation in a trial generally brings no direct\nbenefit to either clinical teams or participants, as\nthe likely beneficiaries will be future patients. It is\nimportant to recognise that there are substantial\ndifferences as well as similarities between trials and\nmost forms of business. Techniques of management\nand marketing should not be adopted uncritically,\nbut they can provide a valuable input into the\nemerging theory of trial management practice.\nThe reference models described above should be\nseen as tentative frameworks rather than definitive\ntemplates. They were developed from a theory-\nbuilding process from a single trial and are best\nconsidered as a set of provocative hypotheses;\nlater they may be developed as provisional audit\ntools. As indicated above, an audit of the CRASH\ntrial enabled components that were considered to\nbe weaker than others to be identified and\ninitiatives undertaken to improve in these areas. \nA clash of cultures?\nMedicine has a basis in scientific method, of which\nRCTs are a prime example. Management is\nfundamentally different as it is rooted in practice\nand can be considered to be a craft in the\nmedieval sense of the word. \u201cMastery requires a\ncombination of science, art, practical experience\nand learning from accomplished masters.\u201d96 This\nis not a hard and fast distinction, as much clinical\npractice is craft based, and some management\ntasks (e.g. the statistical analysis of product quality\nproblems) draw from scientific techniques and are\nevidence based.\nHenry Mintzberg described the essence of\nmanagement when he wrote:97\nScience is about the development of systematic\nknowledge through research. That is hardly the\npurpose of management. Management is not even an\napplied science: for that is still a science.\nManagement certainly applies science: managers have\nto use all of the knowledge that they can get, from the\nsciences and elsewhere. But management is more\nart\u2026.\nThe art of management lies, in part, in the ability\nof the manager to respond to the chaotic nature of\nthe real world.89 The different bases of knowledge\non which medicine and management rest may\npresent difficulties to scientists who seek\nexperimental evidence and tend to eschew a\ndiscipline that is based on craft principles.\nHowever, clinical trials are not just medical\nactivities; they are time-bound businesses that have\ntwo interdependent sets of processes, one clinical\nand the other managerial. In the main, since trials\nare seen as clinical endeavours, they are\ndominated by clinical issues and led by people\nThe clinical trial as a business: a single, in-depth case study of a large multicentre trial\n58with clinical skills. This is essential for certain\npolicies and practices, but this cultural bias can\nresult in the managerial aspects of trials being\nrelatively neglected. If this is true, even if only in\npart, it means that the radical improvement of\nclinical trials could require different ways of\ndefining the challenges of running successful\ntrials; in particular, to ensure that they are seen as\nmanagement challenges that can benefit from the\ninformed use of selected management processes\nand techniques.\nThese considerations suggest that looking within\npast trials for the answers to the problem of\nunderperforming trials is necessary but will not be\nsufficient. In order to improve trials it will be\nnecessary to look outside the world of clinical\npractice, into the worlds of business strategy,\nmanagement, marketing and sales, to gain a fuller\nunderstanding of what can be done to upgrade\nthe performance of clinical trials. This insight is\nnot new. Donovan and colleagues98 state that the\n\u201cmethodological literature (on trials) is almost\nexclusively statistical and epidemiological, and\nvery little of it is concerned with the conduct or\nthe particular demands that trials put on trialists\nand participants\u201d. \nMeaning of the study: possible\nmechanisms and implications for\nclinicians or policy makers\nThis study could begin to change the ways in\nwhich trial managers undertake their work. It also\nprovides a new and different way to think about\nthe skill sets needed by those who manage clinical\ntrials. In essence, the message of this study is\nsimple, even simplistic. It is that trials are both\ncomplex projects and businesses (they need to find\ncustomers). The key implication for clinicians is\nthat insufficient attention to management issues\nand marketing or sales activities will degrade the\nperformance of the trial.\nThere are significant implications for policy\nmakers and funding bodies as well. If the tentative\nconclusions of this study are correct, then the\nfunders will need to examine more than the\nscientific case before sponsoring a trial. They will\nneed to see a business plan, be assured that all of\nthe required elements of the business system will\nbe developed and have a marketing\/sales plan.\nSince a successful trial requires both good science\nand good management, both need to be given\ntheir due weight.\nTrials need participants just as companies need\ncustomers. Trials have something to sell, perhaps a\npromise that, at some time in the future, other\nsick people will benefit from the research being\nundertaken. Trials target participants, develop a\nstory to describe their unique selling points and\nattempt to persuade people to buy in. Once a trial\nhas enrolled a participant it seeks to retain him or\nher. In these and many other respects trials are, in\nfact, businesses.\nBut there are differences. Business is about profit.\nMedicine is driven by human values. It would be\nwrong to suggest that trials need to be more like\nbusinesses; rather, it is suggested that trials may\nbenefit from using business concepts and business\ntechniques.\nThere is a potential benefit for using the reference\nmodels in other trials, especially early in their life\ncycle; this can be described as speeding the\nlearning curve. It took many months of\nmanagement effort for the CRASH trial team to\ndevelop their approach to marketing the trial. The\nclinical coordinator considered that if they had\nhad access to an appropriate model at the\nbeginning it would have accelerated its\ndevelopment and reduced costs, enabling more\neffort to be invested in trial activities.\nThe world of business has spent more time and a\nlot more money than health management in\nfinding tools for marketing and selling. In the\nauthors\u2019 opinion, it makes sense for trialists to\nlearn from business where this could improve trial\nperformance.\nUnanswered questions and future\nresearch\nThere are five unanswered questions that the\nauthors consider to be worthy of further research.\nThese are:\n\u25cf Are the reference models outlined in this\nchapter complete and correct for other trials?\n\u25cf How can useful audit tools be developed from\nthe reference models?\n\u25cf What competencies do trial managers need to\nmanage the business dimensions of their trial?\n\u25cf How can third parties such as advisers, assessors\nor sponsors intervene successfully in a trial in\norder to improve its performance as a business?\n\u25cf What should funding bodies ask about the\nproposed business model, management system\nand marketing\/sales of a trial requesting\nfunding?\nIf there is sufficient commitment to improving the\nbusiness management of trials then the reference\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n59\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.models outlined above will need to be considered\nin the context of other trials to assess their validity.\nIn addition, recognition of concepts common to\nmore than one trial does not necessarily imply\nthat their inclusion into a strategy for future trials\nwill increase recruitment. This strategy needs to be\ntested empirically. However, the perspectives given\nby this study have proved provocative and have\nstimulated much consideration into what it means\nfor a trial to be well managed.\nIf this does not happen, then Farrell\u2019s call85 to\naddress the role of management in the effective\ndelivery of a trial will have fallen on deaf ears and\nsome trials will continue to disappoint, despite\ntheir scientific merit. Nevertheless, it is important\nto emphasise that ethics must not be compromised\nand that improved management and marketing\neffectiveness must not be allowed to become\nunethical, thereby causing distress to patients and\ntheir families or to healthcare workers by using a\nhard sell inappropriately.\nPersonal reflection\nAlthough some trialists tend to denigrate forms of\nknowledge other than that from the hard sciences\n(which can be a barrier to cross-disciplinary\nlearning), the management researcher (DF) found\nhimself at home in the trials world since the sorts\nof issues that trial managers raised were variants\nof those that occupy managers in the commercial\nworld. He felt that the groups that he encountered\nhad remarkable energy, commitment and sense of\nmission, and he saw that the management policies\nand practices that he introduced using an action\nresearch approach were not alien: they were\ndevelopments of approaches that were already\nbeing used by the trial management team.\nAs academic researchers we surround our findings\nwith caveats, but managers from the world of\nbusiness can be cavalier and say, \u201cyes, a trial is a\nbusiness and a trial needs to employ up-to-date\nmanagement practices if it is to achieve its\npromise; simply looking within the world of trials\nwill not provide all the answers. It is time for trial\nmanagers to take as much pride in the\nmanagement of their trial as they do in the\nmedical advance that it delivers\u201d.\nThe clinical trial as a business: a single, in-depth case study of a large multicentre trial\n60T\nhis chapter first refers back to the\ncommissioning brief and the successful\napplication from the STEPS team. It then briefly\nsummarises the main findings from Parts A, B and\nC, and their individual strengths and weaknesses.\nFinally, the authors consider what has been learnt\nfrom the study overall and what questions remain\nunanswered, and suggest areas for future research. \nBackground\nThe commissioning brief for this project followed\nfrom the perspective that although large sums of\nmoney are spent on multicentre trials, the trials\noften fail to achieve planned levels of recruitment.\nFast recruitment is desirable as it brings important\nbenefits in terms of providing knowledge more\nquickly and reducing research costs. It is possible\nthat differences in the design and execution of\nthese trials could result in better or worse\nrecruitment rates. The HTA Programme and MRC\ntherefore jointly prioritised this research to \u201clearn\nlessons latent in the existing experience\u201d of such\ntrials.\nThe STEPS team adopted both quantitative and\nqualitative methods to concentrate on factors that\nmay affect participation of clinicians and\ncollaborating researchers (rather than patients)\nthrough three components: an epidemiological\nreview of a cohort of multicentre trials funded by\nthe MRC and the HTA Programme; case studies\nof four trials that appeared to have particularly\ninteresting lessons for recruitment; and a single,\nin-depth case study to assess the feasibility of\napplying business theory to trial recruitment. \nPrincipal findings, strengths and\nweaknesses\nPart A: epidemiological review\nThe results of the epidemiological review of \nMRC and HTA Programme multicentre trials\nconfirm the concern expressed in the\ncommissioning brief that failures to achieve\nprojected targets for participant recruitment,\nextensions of the recruitment period and\nsupplementary grants are indeed common. \nAs few as one-third of trials recruited to 100% of\noriginal target and around one-third had\nextensions. The analyses within this cohort of\nfactors associated with successful recruitment\n(from the research literature) provide some\nsupport that the intervention only being available\ninside the trial, having a dedicated trial manager\nand being a cancer trial or a drug trial were\nassociated with success. However, these findings\nshould be interpreted cautiously; the confidence\nintervals were all wide, at best these associations\nwere only marginally statistically significant and\nthe trend for some other factors was towards a\nnegative association.\nThe strengths and weaknesses are discussed in\nChapter 2. The main strength was that it included\na systematically identified, complete cohort of\ntrials from a wide spectrum of clinical areas,\nclinical settings and geographical centres. The\ndata were prospectively collected for other\npurposes and so were unlikely to be biased in\nrespect to the questions being addressed for\nSTEPS. An important limitation was the number\nof trials available for analysis. Although an\nattempt was made to include as many studies as\npossible, there were fewer than had originally\nbeen anticipated and a sample size of 114 gave\nonly limited scope for exploratory analyses. As in\nthe commissioning brief, the planned level of\nrecruitment was used as a surrogate measure for\nthe \u2018success\u2019 of a trial. As indicated in Chapter 2,\nthe use of this marker as a sole indicator of\nrecruitment success is rather limited, as initial\nsample size estimates are often more an informed\nguide, based on imperfect information and other\nconsiderations such as feasibility and cost.\nArguably more significant measures, such as the\nextent to which the trial question has been\nsuccessfully addressed, the perception of funders\nand other key stakeholders as to whether the trial\nwas successful, and the impact of the results on\nclinical practice, would be more useful. Other\nnecessary limitations of the epidemiological\napproach, such as the secondary use of data\ncollected for other purposes (including the\nmisspecification of the \u2018exposure\u2019 variables, and\nvariation in the quality of the reporting), and\ninterrelationships between possible explanatory\nfactors, mean that conclusions about causative\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n61\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Although there were\nsome attempts to go back to PIs for further details\nand understanding, these were limited in scope\nowing to restrictions in the STEPS budget. \nThis component proved less useful than expected\nfor exploring factors related to recruitment. No\ntrial was identified that showed a clear change in\nthe recruitment rate at a particular point in time.\nHence, although a range of strategies aimed at\nimproving recruitment was described (Table 13), it\nwas not possible to assess the extent to which they\nwere causally linked to changes in recruitment.\nThe value of this part of the study was therefore\nprimarily as a descriptor of the problems and of\ntrialists\u2019 attempts to overcome them, rather than\nproviding evidence about how useful the strategies\nwere.\nPart B: case studies\nThe results of the in-depth analyses of interviews\nfrom four trials considered by their funders to be\n\u2018exemplars\u2019 suggested that successful trials were\nthose addressing clinically important questions at\na timely point. The interviewers highlighted that\nthe trials were led by investigators who were held\nin high esteem by the interviewees, and they were\nfirmly grounded in existing clinical practices, both\nso that the trial processes were not alien to the\nclinical collaborators and so that the results could\nbe easily applicable to future practice. The\ninterviewees considered that the needs of the\npatients were well served by participation in the\ntrial. Good groundwork and excellent\ncommunication across the many levels of the\ncomplex structures of trials were considered to be\nextremely important, including training\ncomponents for learning about the trial\ninterventions and processes, as well as team\nbuilding. Clinical collaborators particularly\nappreciated the clear delineation of roles which\nreleased them from much of the workload\npotentially associated with trial participation.\nAlthough the perception of \u2018success\u2019 was not in\nterms of the study results (as only HPS had\nreported its findings), there was a strong feeling\nfrom the interviewees that they were proud to be\npart of a successful team, and that this pride in\nitself fed into further success.\nThe main strength of Part B was that the in-depth\ninvestigation into the four trials took an\nindependent outsider perspective. By building on\nthe experience of Part A, the focus shifted from a\nrestricted definition of success as meeting the\nrecruitment target within the planned time-frame\nto funders\u2019 perceptions of successful trials. The\nfour trials were all aiming to be the largest \nof their kind in the world, and spanned a range of\nclinical and research situations. They were not\nchosen as \u2018easy\u2019 trials. Indeed, all had faced\nrecruitment problems, and extra insights into \nthe working of trials were afforded by the\ndescriptions of these problems, and strategies\ninvoked to address them. The 45 interviewees\nperformed a range of roles within the trials.\nEnabling them to reflect within semi-structured\ninterviews allowed them to consider their trials as\na whole, not merely in terms of meeting\nrecruitment targets, and their emphasis on the\nnecessary foundations for building a trial is a facet\nthat does not appear to have been previously\nreported. \nThe main weaknesses of Part B have been\nmentioned in Chapter 3. Only four trials were\ninvolved, and this is not merely a small number,\nbut possibly atypical of successful trials. The\ninterviews were with people intimately involved\nwith the trials and therefore did not include the\nperspectives of people with more peripheral roles,\nsuch as DMCs and TSCs. No interviews were\nconducted with teams within trials that were not\nexemplars. These limitations were mainly due to\ndelays from the RECs and trust R&Ds, and to\nrestrictions in the STEPS period and budget. \nThe implications are that it is not known to what\nextent the perceptions of those involved in \nthese exemplars differed from those in other \ntrials that were less successful. Most, if not all, PIs\nare likely to argue that their own trials are\nimportant and timely. The other features\nidentified that are common to all four exemplars,\nsuch as the importance of good communications,\nare likely to be essential for successful trials, but\nwould not by themselves guarantee success. It \nwas planned to extend this component of the\nproject to address these issues if further funding\nhad been available, but this funding was not\nforthcoming.\nPart C: the clinical trial as a business\nThe main result of Part C was to draw attention to\na body of research and practice in a different\ndiscipline (academic business studies), and\ngenerate a reference model derived from a\ncombination of business theory and work within\nthe CRASH trial.\nPart C complements the emphasis on trial\nprocesses in Parts A and B. Disciplines often work\non their own, and an important strength of Part C\nhas been to make explicit connections between the\nmanagement of trials and the management of\nDiscussion\n62businesses. In the CRASH trial, this enabled\nidentification of weaker managerial components\nand initiatives to strengthen them. \nThe main weaknesses of Part C have been\nmentioned in Chapter 4. As with Part B, it is based\non a case-study approach, and the CRASH trial\nmay be a different case in important ways from\nother trials. For example, the CRASH trial\ninvolved patients who were unconscious and hence\nrecruitment focused on the participation of\nclinicians. In contrast, in most trials, efforts are\nconcentrated on recruitment of patients. In\naddition, the management approach has not been\nformally evaluated even within business settings,\nand it is not clear whether the initiatives that\nfollow from developing and applying the reference\nmodel will be effective in increasing recruitment\nor other aspects of the success of CRASH or other\ntrials. \nNevertheless, the authors see the outputs of this\ncomponent as potentially the most useful for\naddressing the commissioning brief. The reference\nmodel developed for the CRASH trial could\nprovide a template, with the potential for those\nmanaging other trials to use or adapt it, \nespecially at the foundation stages. Parallels \ncan be drawn with professional behaviour change\nresearch where psychological models are being\nused to address the reasons for unwanted\nbehaviours and hence to design appropriate\nstrategies for behaviour change.99 The reference\nmodel derived from this project could be used \nas a diagnostic tool if a trial has difficulties and\nhence as a basis for deciding what type of\nremedial action to take. It might also be useful \nfor audit of a trial\u2019s progress, such as during\nexternal review. \nDiscussion of the overall findings\nfrom STEPS\nInitially, trials that had recruited to their target\nsample sizes were considered as successful, and\nPart A has clearly confirmed there is a problem \nin terms of trials not reaching their targets \nwithin the specified time-frame and budget. \nThis therefore seemed a sensible starting point\ngiven that rigorous scientific peer review had\nagreed what sample sizes were appropriate, \nand recruitment is a key element for trials, \nand it may be a sine qua non for a successful \ntrial. None of the STEPS components was,\nhowever, able to provide definitive answers about\nwhat exactly are the causes of or the solutions \nto the problem of not achieving recruitment\ntargets.\nRather, the research has pointed to some of the\ncomplexities in trials and cast light on the\nquestion by asking: \u2018what makes a trial a success?\u2019\nIt was concluded that recruitment is only one\naspect of success and what matters is whether the\ntrial has provided answers to important questions.\n\u2018Important\u2019 may have a number of dimensions in\nthe context of trials funded by the MRC and HTA\nProgramme. For instance, will it have a beneficial\neffect on patient care, either directly or indirectly?\nDoes the trial address major public health issues\nfor large numbers of people (as in HPS), or does it\nhelp to clarify end-of-life decisions for a small\nnumber of cancer sufferers (as in FOCUS)? Does it\nadd pieces to the jigsaw of cancer care, or is it\ncutting-edge science? Does it help to reach\npatients who are hard to bring in to trials (as in\nELEVATE and TOuCAN), and perhaps set up\nnetworks of clinicians prepared to take part in\nfuture trials?\nImportance from the standpoint of Part B cannot\njust be about finding positive answers, as only one\nof the four trials (HPS) had reported results. With\nthe help of the HTA Programme and the MRC,\nfour exemplar trials were identified. In the\ninterviews for Part B, participants appeared to\nagree that they were examples of successful trials.\nThey exuded a feeling of confidence in their\nteams and shared enthusiasm about their trials.\nPerhaps their self-belief was infectious and helped\nthem in \u2018marketing their trials to their\ncollaborators and to their funders\u2019.\nThese four trials were not unusual in returning to\nfunders for extensions: based on the findings from\nPart A, this applies to around 50% of all trials,\nmost of which were awarded extra funding. It is\nunclear whether this is because the trials are\nunderfunded in the first place, because applicants\nare not able to predict the funding that will be\nrequired, or because circumstances change\nbetween the time of the application and the\nrecruitment phase of the trial, or because\ninvestigators are strategically underbidding to get\na foot in the door to obtain some funding, even if\nthis is unlikely to be sufficient. Even though large\nsums are spent by the MRC and HTA Programme\non trials (although the amount is small in relation\nto the overall budget for the NHS), there is a\nstrong perception from trialists that money for\npublicly funded trials is tight. Additional sources\nof money were sought in three of the four Part B\ntrials. Although much of this was from the\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n63\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007. All rights reserved.pharmaceutical industry, many of the trials in the\nMRC and HTA Programme portfolio are for\nresearch that industry is not interested in funding.\nDual funding brought concerns about clinical and\nacademic independence, and the effort to obtain\nthe additional funding represented an important\ndrain on the time and energies of the investigators.\nSTEPS suggested that the science and budget at\nthe application stage need to be complemented by\ndifferent capabilities for setting up and running\ntrials. Particularly in trials that may be\nunderfunded, the techniques of social marketing\n(as used for charities), building on shared values,\nmay be helpful in motivating collaborators to\nparticipate. Similarly, funders are mainly experts\nin the scientific domains, but may be less skilled in\nassessing the strength or weaknesses of the trial\nprocesses.\nProvisos\nIt should be noted that STEPS was based on MRC\nand HTA Programme-funded trials. The\nconclusions may therefore not generalise to other\nfunders of trials (e.g. charities and industry),\nalthough some of the trials in both Parts A and B\nhad dual funders. In addition, the study was\nconducted at a particular point in time, and \nthe findings may become less relevant for future\ntrials. \nThe research process\nMultilensing\nSTEPS has used three different approaches to\ninvestigate aspects of the same perceived problem\nof poor recruitment in trials. At one level, these\napproaches could be seen as setting down three\ndifferent roads that do not meet each other. In\npractice, although some individuals were more\ninvolved in one part than another, the three parts\nhave all been influenced by the different\nperspectives of all those in the team, as well as the\nresearch funders (MRC and HTA Programme).\nThroughout the project, the team worked together\nto develop and refine the questions and the\nemerging conclusions. Bringing together this\ncollection of people has been a research process in\nits own right, acting as a springboard for shaping\nthe research. This methodological pluralism\n(multilensing) has resulted in a more informed\nand more expert position. \nBarriers to this research\nThere were two main barriers to this research.\nOne was simply the amount of time and money\navailable to conduct the project. Working within\nthe constraints of a fixed one-year grant and a\nfixed upper limit for funding, the present authors\nno doubt did what they were finding the STEPS\ntrialists doing: making a good case for the work\nthey would carry out, but possibly being\nunconsciously overambitious, in part to secure the\ninitial competitive funding. The team was also\nworking in the expectation, as stated in the\ncommissioning brief, that \u201ccontinuation into a\nsecond year may be possible, subject to review at 8\nmonths based on emerging results\u201d. In the event\nthis additional funding was not forthcoming.\nThe second major constraint related to the work\nin Part B. As described in Chapter 3, this involved\ntelephone interviews with trial coordinating staff\nand clinical investigators spread over the UK.\nConsiderable unanticipated delays occurred owing\nto the need, first, to obtain MREC approval for\nthe study, and second, to obtain permission from\nseveral trust R&D departments. (Again, this is\nlikely to have parallels with difficulties\nexperienced in trials that were reviewed, where\nunpredicted and unpredictable problems may\nhave been caused by changes in the external\nenvironment, which were often outside their\ncontrol.)\nThe need for MREC approval was unexpected and\ntime consuming, but at least only required one\ncentral application. Permission from R&D\ndepartments was also unexpected and even more\ntime consuming. It required a separate application\nfor each trust in which a potential interviewee was\nbased. The paperwork was extensive and non-\nstandard, and included applications for honorary\ncontracts and the need to provide references. The\nchecks verged on the ludicrous, including\ncompletion of occupational health forms and even\na suggestion of police checks. The process was\nlabour intensive for the main Part B researcher,\nand added at least 4 months\u2019 delay to work on this\npart. Clearly, this is disproportionate to this type\nof research, which involves neither patients nor\nface-to-face contact. The implications, however,\nare that either this extra amount of time (and\ntherefore funding) needs to be built into grant\napplications (and funders need to be aware of the\nneed to raise the funding level to take these\nconsiderations into account), or these sorts of\nstudies involving a geographical spread of\ninterviewees will no longer be possible within\ntime-limited and budget-capped research projects.\nThis concern about disproportionate barriers to\nresearch is not specific to STEPS (see recent\neditorial100 and corresponding papers).\nDiscussion\n64Implications for practice for\ntrialists and funders\nWhile not having sufficiently definitive results to\nmake strong recommendations, the authors\nbelieve that the work in STEPS allows them to\nmake some tentative suggestions, that people\nundertaking future trials ought at least to think\nabout the different phases in the life of trials, and\nthe need to put greater emphasis on the process of\nactually doing trials. This implies learning lessons\nfrom successful trial managers, with better training\nfacilities in this important area. Applicants could\nbe encouraged to predict more accurately the\nfeasibility of meeting their planned target sizes\nand recruitment periods, and their needs for\nfunding.\nFunders need reciprocally to encourage more\nrealistic applications, with the implication that, if\nthe same total amount of money were to be\navailable, fewer trials would be able to be funded,\nbut the ones that were should be less likely to need\nfurther funding midway through the process. The\nauthors would urge that funders\u2019 assessments\nshould take into account not only the science but\nalso the importance of the question and the\nlikelihood of its being answered, bearing in mind\nthe likely conduct of the trial. Part B suggested\nthat successful trials were those able to weather\nstorms that blew up, both because they had built\nup a firm and stable structure that was unlikely to\nbe knocked off course, but also because they were\nable to be flexible enough to adapt to unexpected\nissues. Perhaps funders could assess this potential\nfor agility in much the same way as interviewees\nfor jobs are asked how they have dealt with or\nwould tackle a difficult situation. Arguably, the\ntrialists should also expect agility from funders.\nThe complexity of large trials means that\nunanticipated difficulties are highly likely at some\ntime in every trial. Funders should recognise this\nand be prepared to help, financially if necessary, if\nthe causes are beyond the trialists\u2019 control. Both\nthe MRC and the HTA Programme have\ndeveloped increasingly proactive approaches to\ntrial monitoring, and this could be extending to\nmonitoring expenditure and remodelling funding\nprofiles in the light of developments and progress.\nFunders may also need a formal process of\nassessing the \u2018payback\u2019 of research101 or \u2018the value\nof the information\u2019102 to be gained from funding\nthe trial, against other calls on scarce resources.\nIdeally, this assessment would need to be kept\nunder observation by funders efficiently\nmonitoring ongoing trials.\nImplications for further research\nThe original application for Part B had aimed to\nlook at a larger number of trials with different\nrecruitment patterns. In consultation with the\nfunders, the research team decided to concentrate\nfirst on multiple voices from four exemplar trials.\nTo assess whether the conduct of the successful\ntrials might be able to provide lessons for how\nother trials could be successful, further in-depth\ninvestigation into trials with different recruitment\npatterns (including \u2018failures\u2019) is necessary to\nunderstand whether the patterns seen in the\nsuccessful trials differ or are similar. Furthermore,\nalthough the perceptions of people intimately\ninvolved with the trials are invaluable, the addition\nof the voices of independent members of DMCs\nand TSCs, who may be knowledgeable but have\nsufficient distance to be more objective, could add\nfurther insights. \nAnother area for further research involves\nextending the reference model developed in the\nCRASH trial (in which patients were mainly\nunconscious) to other settings, to see whether it\nneeds refinement and adaptation for other trials.\nThis may lead to the development of a checklist\nthat could be used as an audit tool for addressing\nmanagement factors. Research is also needed to\nassess whether its application can help as a\ndiagnostic of any problem and hence to choose\nstrategies that are the most likely to increase\nrecruitment rates or other markers of the success\nof a trial. Finally, these and other strategies need\nto be formally evaluated for their effectiveness in a\nrange of trials.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n65\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

The research assesses factors associated with\nrecruitment to randomized controlled trials and is funded by the Department of Health\u2019s Health\nTechnology Assessment Programme and the Medical Research Council. It is being carried out by\nresearchers at the Universities of Aberdeen, London, Brighton and Cambridge. As part of this project we\nare carrying out a qualitative sub-study to examine the views of those involved in a number of trials, one\nof which is the ZZZ Trial. It involves interviews with medical staff who have had some experience of\nrecruiting to this trial. As you were involved in the recruitment of some patients to the ZZZ Trial we\nwould like to ask you to take part in the research.\nThe interviews will explore clinicians\u2019 opinions about the trials, highlighting any specific features which\nmay have helped or hindered the recruitment process. The interview will not include discussion of\nindividual patients and we must ensure that there is no disclosure of information about individual\npatients in the course of the interview. With your permission the interview would be tape-recorded. The\ntape will be transcribed by a transcribing company which has been used and trusted by the researchers\nfor over 5 years. It would be marked confidential and a study number rather than your name would be\nused to identify the tape. The opinions expressed in interview will be treated as confidential although of\ncourse we would aim to use non-attributed comments in any publications that are written. You would be\nasked after the interview to complete a one page demographic questionnaire.\nThere is a reply slip and prepaid envelope with this letter if you want to let me know whether or not you\nare interested in taking part in the study. Alternatively you could email me if that is convenient, at\ncms1000@cam.ac.uk. As we are working to a tight schedule, I will call you some time in the next week or\nso unless I hear that you would prefer not to take part. In the meantime if you wish to know more about\nthe research you could call on the above number or email me and I would be happy to answer any\nqueries you have. \nYours sincerely\nClaire Snowdon \nResearch Fellow .............................................................................................................................\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n93\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.

Before you decide it is important for you to\nunderstand why the research is being done and\nwhat it will involve. Please take time to read the\nfollowing information carefully and discuss it with\nothers if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that\nis not clear or if you would like more information.\nTake time to decide whether or not you wish to\ntake part.\nThank you for reading this. \nWhat is the purpose of the study?\nAs part of a larger project which is assessing\nfactors associated with recruitment to trials, we are\ncarrying our a qualitative sub-study to examine the\nviews of those involved in a number of\nrandomised controlled trials, one of which is the\n[name] Trial. The study is due for completion at\nthe end of March 2003.\nWhy have I been chosen and do I have to take\npart?\nThe qualitative study involves interviews with\nmedical staff who have had some experience of\nrecruiting to this trial. As you were involved in the\nrecruitment of some patients to the [name] Trial\nwe would like to ask you to take part in the\nresearch. Within the current funding we will be\ncarrying out approximately 30 interviews. It is up\nto you to decide whether or not to take part. If\nyou do decide to take part you will be given this\ninformation sheet to keep and be asked to sign a\nconsent form. If you decide to take part you are\nstill free to withdraw at any time and without\ngiving a reason.\nWhat will happen to me if I take part?\nThe clinicians that decide to take part in the study\nwill be interviewed either by telephone or in\nperson. The interviews will explore clinicians\u2019\nopinions about the trials, highlighting any specific\nfeatures which may have helped or hindered the\nrecruitment process. The interview will not include\ndiscussion of individual patients and we must\nensure that there is no disclosure of information\nabout individual patients in the course of the\ninterview. Interviewees would be asked to complete\na one page demographic questionnaire. Once the\ninterview and questionnaire are completed, no\nfurther assistance with the study would be required.\nWith your permission the interview will be tape-\nrecorded. The tape will be transcribed by a\ntranscribing company which has been used and\ntrusted by the researchers for over 5 years. All\ninformation which is collected about you during\nthe course of the research will be kept strictly\nconfidential. Any information about you which\nleaves the Centre for Family Research will have\nyour name and address removed so that you\ncannot be recognised from it. The opinions that\nyou express in interview will be treated as\nconfidential although of course we would aim to\nuse non-attributed comments in any publications\nthat are written. For individuals with specific roles\nwithin trials, e.g. Principal Investigator or trial\nmanager, it is possible that you may be identified\nbecause your name is connected with a specific\ntrial in the public domain. We will take every step\nwe can to use data sensitively for this study.\nWhat will happen to the results of the research\nstudy?\nThe results of this research are likely to be\npublished in 2004\/5 although a report will be\navailable at an earlier date. Our usual policy is to\nsend a copy of the results to interviewees. If your\ncontact details are likely to change you may wish\nto give us an alternative address if you do wish to\nhave a copy of the findings.\nHealth Technology Assessment 2007; Vol. 11: No. 48\n95\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2007.
