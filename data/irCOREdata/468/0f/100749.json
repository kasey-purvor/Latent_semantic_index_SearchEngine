INTRODUCTION\nThe \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n reaction at low energies is an interesting\ntopic in nuclear physics. This reaction can provide a good\nprobe into the structure of some low-lying resonances, such\nas S11(1535), of which the property still bares a lot of\ncontroversies. In the naive quark model, it is classified as the\nlowest L = 1 orbital excited state with JP = 1\/2\u2212. Recently,\nit is argued that it may contain a large admixture of pentaquark\ncomponent [1], which will explain the reversed mass ordering\nbetween the S11(1535) and P11(1440). By studying this\nreaction, one can extract the \u03b7N interaction, for which a\npossible strong attraction between \u03b7 and N at low energies\nmay lead to \u201c\u03b7-mesic nuclei\u201d [2,3]. In general, more and\nmore accurate data from \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n experiments will provide\na challenging testing ground for the low-energy theories of\nhadron interactions, such as chiral perturbation theory, the\nmeson-exchange model, etc.\nOn the process \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n, there have been a few exper-\niments. The data come mainly from the old measurements\nfrom about 30 years ago [4\u20139], which have been reviewed by\nClajus and Nefkens [10]. Fortunately, a recent \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n\nexperiment was performed at BNL using the Crystal Ball\nspectrometer [11]. The differential cross sections together with\ntotal cross section for \u03b7 production in reaction \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n\nhave been measured at the incident \u03c0 beam momenta from\nthreshold to p\u03c0 = 747 MeV\/c. The quality of the data was\nsignificantly improved compared with the previous measure-\nments. Theoretically, a few typical models have been used\nto deal with the \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n reactions [12\u201319], such as the\ncoupled-channel model, meson-exchange model, the chiral\nmultichannel model. As pointed out in Ref. [20], the present\ntheory is far from being as accurate as the experiment. Thus,\nmore theoretical studies are needed.\nIn this work, we introduce an effective chiral Lagrangian\nto describe the quark-pseudoscalar-meson coupling and study\nthe meson-nucleon scattering in the constituent quark model.\nThis approach has been successfully applied to the study of\nthe meson photoproduction off nucleons [21\u201332]. Because\nthe quark-pseudoscalar-meson coupling is invariant under the\nchiral transformation, some of the low-energy properties of\nquantum chromodynamics (QCD) are retained. There are\nseveral outstanding features for this model. One is that only\na very limited number of parameters will appear in this\nframework. In particular, only one parameter is need for the\nresonances to be coupled to the pseudoscalar mesons. This\ndistinguishes from hadronic models where each resonance\nrequires one additional coupling constant as free parameter.\nThe second is that all the resonances can be treated consistently\nin the quark model. Thus, it has predictive powers when\nexposed to experimental data, and information about the\nresonance structures can be extracted.\nHowever, it should be clarified that we restrict the\nquark-meson interactions in the scattering processes where\nthe mesons are external fields interacting with the con-\nstituent quarks of the Isgur-Karl model [33]. Thus, the\nspin-independent quark confinement potential is described\nby harmonic oscillator potential. This allows an analytic\nseparation of the intermediate meson excitation matrix ele-\nments. In principle, the quark-meson interaction will influence\nthe description of the constituent quark potentials, e.g.,\nmodifications to the quark interactions may occur and naive\nquark-model spectrum will be changed. We leave this to\nbe investigated in future development of this approach. The\nbaryon spectroscopy studied via Goldstone-boson exchanges\n(GBE) can be found in Ref. [34]. An extended chiral quark-\nmodel approach combining both one-gluon-exchange (OGE)\nand GBE potentials was also investigated in the literature\n[35,36].\nIn this work, we investigated the \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n reaction\nfrom the \u03b7 production threshold to the center-of-mass energy\nW \u0003 1.7 GeV. Our results are in good agreement with the\ndata. We find that S11(1535) dominates the reaction around\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(6)\/065205(11) 065205-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nXIAN-HUI ZHONG, QIANG ZHAO, JUN HE, AND BIJAN SAGHAI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 065205 (2007)\nthreshold. The resonances D13(1520) and S11(1650) also\nplay very important roles in the process. The D13(1520)\nis crucial to give correct shapes of the differential cross\nsections, although its contributions to the cross section are very\nsmall near threshold. The S11(1650) has important destruc-\ntive interferences with the dominant S11(1535) around W <\u223c\n1.6 GeV. Above the center-of-mass energy W \u0003 1.6 GeV,\nthe contributions of higher resonances from n = 2 shell also\nappear. The predictions of differential cross sections become\nworse with the increasing center-of-mass energy W . The\nresonance P11(1710) plays an important role, it is crucial\nto produce an enhancement in the region of W > 1.6 GeV\nas suggested by the data for total cross section and with\nwhich the theoretical predictions are obviously improved if\nwe change the sign of its amplitude. The nucleon pole term\ncontributions turn out to be necessary though a relatively small\ng\u03b7NN coupling is favored. The t-channel is negligible in the\nreactions.\nThe article is organized as follows. In the subsequent\nsection, the framework is outlined. Then, the transition\namplitudes in the quark model are derived in Sec. III. The\nresonance contributions are separated out in Sec. IV. We\npresent our calculations and discussions in Sec. V. Finally,\na summary is given in Sec. VI.\nII. FRAMEWORK\nIn the chiral quark model, the low-energy quark-meson\ninteractions are described by the effective Lagrangian [27,29]\nL = \u00af\u03c8[\u03b3\u00b5(i\u2202\u00b5 + V \u00b5 + \u03b35A\u00b5) \u2212 m]\u03c8 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, (1)\nwhere V \u00b5 and A\u00b5 correspond to vector and axial currents,\nrespectively. They are given by\nV \u00b5 = 1\n2\n(\u03be\u2202\u00b5\u03be \u2020 + \u03be \u2020\u2202\u00b5\u03be ),\n(2)\nA\u00b5 = 1\n2i\n(\u03be\u2202\u00b5\u03be \u2020 \u2212 \u03be \u2020\u2202\u00b5\u03be ),\nwith \u03be = exp (i\u03c6m\/fm), where fm is the meson decay constant.\nFor the SU(3) case, the pseudoscalar-meson octet \u03c6m can be\nexpressed as\n\u03c6m =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\u221a\n2\n\u03c00 + 1\u221a6\u03b7 \u03c0+ K+\n\u03c0\u2212 \u2212 1\u221a\n2\n\u03c00 + 1\u221a6\u03b7 K0\nK\u2212 \u00afK0 \u2212\n\u221a\n2\n3\u03b7\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (3)\nand the quark field \u03c8 is given by\n\u03c8 =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u03c8(u)\n\u03c8(d)\n\u03c8(s)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 .

(1)], we\nobtain the standard quark-meson pseudovector coupling at tree\nlevel\nHm =\n\u2211\nj\n1\nfm\n\u00af\u03c8j\u03b3\nj\n\u00b5\u03b3\nj\n5 \u03c8j\u2202\n\u00b5\u03c6m, (5)\nFIG. 1. s, u, and t channels are considered in this work. Ms3 and\nMu3 (Ms2 ,Mu2 ) correspond to the amplitudes of s and u channels for\nthe incoming meson and outgoing meson absorbed and emitted by\nthe same quark (different quarks), respectively.\nwhere \u03c8j represents the j -th quark field in the nucleon.\nThe \u03b7 meson production amplitude (see Fig. 1) can be\nexpressed in term of the Mandelstam variables:\nM =Ms +Mu +Mt .

H\u03c0 and H\u03b7 are the standard\nquark-meson couplings at tree level described by Eq. (5).\n|Ni\u3009, |Nj \u3009, and |Nf \u3009 stand for the initial, intermediate, and\nfinal states, respectively, and their corresponding energies are\nEi,Ej , and Ef , which are the eigenvalues of the NRCQM\nHamiltonian \u02c6H [33].\nFollowing the procedures developed in Refs. [23,27,29],\none can then express the s- and u-channel amplitudes by\noperator expansions. For instance, the s channel can be written\nas\nMs =\n\u2211\nj\n\u3008Nf |H\u03b7|Nj \u3009\u3008Nj |\n\u2211\nn\n1\n\u03c9n+1\u03c0\n( \u02c6H \u2212 Ei)nH\u03c0 |Ni\u3009, (9)\nwhere n is the harmonic oscillator quantum number. Note that\nfor any operator O, one has\n( \u02c6H \u2212 Ei)O|Ni\u3009 = [ \u02c6H,O]|Ni\u3009, (10)\na systematic expansion of the commutator between the\nNRCQM Hamiltonian \u02c6H and the vertex coupling H\u03c0 and\nH\u03b7 can thus be carried out. Details of this treatment can be\nfound in Refs. [23,27,29], but we note that in this study only\nthe spin-independent potential in \u02c6H is considered a feasible\nleading-order calculation.\nFrom the Particle Data Group (PDG) [37] we know that\nthe a0 meson decay is dominated by a \u03c0\u03b7 channel. Thus, we\nconsider a0 exchange as the dominant contributions to the\nt-channel transitions. For the \u03c0\u03b7a0 coupling, we introduce the\nfollowing effective Lagrangian\nLa0\u03c0\u03b7 = ga0\u03c0\u03b7m\u03c0\u03b7 \u0007\u03c0 \u0007a0, (11)\n065205-2\nTHE \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n REACTION AT LOW . . .

In the above nonrelativistic\nexpansions, vectors rj and pj are the internal coordinate and\nmomentum for the j -th quark in the nucleon rest frame. \u03c9m\nand q are the energy and three-vector momentum of the meson,\nrespectively. The isospin operator Ij in Eqs.

The axial vector coupling can then be related to the \u03c0NN\nand \u03b7NN couplings via the Goldberger-Treiman relation [38].\nIII.

(50)\nThe first terms in Eqs. (35), (36), (47), and (48) come\nfrom the correlation between the center-of-mass motion of\nthe pion meson transition operator and the center-of-mass\nmotion of \u03b7-meson transition operator; the second and the\nthird terms are the correlation among the internal and the\ncenter-of-mass motions of the \u03c0\u2212 and \u03b7 transition operators,\nand their contributions begin with the n\u0002 1 exited states in the\nharmonic oscillator basis. The last two terms in these equations\ncorrespond to the correlation of the internal motion between\nthe \u03c0\u2212 and \u03b7 transition operators, and their contributions\nbegin with either n\u0002 1 or n\u0002 2 exited states. The higher\nshell-resonance amplitudes are suppressed remarkably by the\nfactors 1\/n! and X n \u2261 (k \u00b7 q\/3\u03b12)n, which come from the\nspacial integral.\nIV. SEPARATION OF THE RESONANCE CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe obtained amplitudes, Ms and Mu, involve excited\nstates with the total excitation quantum number n in the\nharmonic oscillator basis, which are degenerate to each other.\nTo see the contributions of individual resonances, we need\nto separate out the single-resonance-excitation amplitudes for\neach n. In this work we separate out only the resonance\nexcitation amplitudes for the s channel and treat the resonances\nin the u channel as degenerate to n. This is because the\nresonances in the u channel contribute virtually and are\ngenerally suppressed by the kinematics.\nIn the amplitudes for the s and u channels, the factors Fs(n)\nand Fu(n) can be rewritten as\nFs(n) = 2Mn\ns \u2212 M2n\n, (51)\nFu(n) = \u22122Mn\nu \u2212 M2n\n, (52)\nwhere s[= (Pi + k)2] and u[= (Pi \u2212 q)2] are the Mandelstam\nvariables. Taking into account the effects of the resonance\nmass and width, we thus substitute a Breit-Wigner distribution\nfor Fs(n), i.e.,\nFs(n) \u2192 Fs(R) = 2MR\ns \u2212 M2R + iMR\fR\n, (53)\nwhere MR and \fR are the resonance mass and width,\nrespectively. The resonance transition amplitudes in the s and\n065205-5\nXIAN-HUI ZHONG, QIANG ZHAO, JUN HE, AND BIJAN SAGHAI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 065205 (2007)\nu channels can be generally expressed as\nMsR =\n2MR\ns \u2212 M2R + iMR\fR\nORe\u2212(k2+q2)\/6\u03b12 , (54)\nand\nMun =\n2Mn\nu \u2212 M2n\nOne\u2212(k2+q2)\/6\u03b12 , (55)\nrespectively, whereOR andOn are determined by the structure\nof each resonance and their couplings to the meson and\nnucleon.\nIt should be pointed out that the introduction of the Breit-\nWigner widths in the s channel is arbitrary in this framework,\nwhere the width effects from intermediate resonances cannot\nbe automatically produced. However, because it allows a\nseparation of individual resonances, the inclusion of resonance\nwidths from the experiments will make an explicit connection\nbetween the transition amplitudes and individual resonance\ncontributions. It should also be mentioned that such an analytic\nadvantage will only appear in the NRQCD model where a\nharmonic oscillator potential is employed.\nA. n = 0 shell resonances\nFor n = 0, only the nucleon pole term contributes to the\ntransition amplitude. Its s-channel amplitude is\nMsN = ON\n2M0\ns \u2212 M20\ne\u2212(k\n2+q2)\/6\u03b12 , (56)\nwith\nON = [gs1 + gs2]A\u03b7 \u00b7 A\u03c0 + [gv1 + gv2] i\u03c3 \u00b7 (A\u03b7 \u00d7 A\u03c0 ),\n(57)\nwhere M0 is the nucleon mass.\nB. n = 1 shell resonances\nFor n = 1, only S and D waves contribute in the s channel.\nNote that the spin-independent amplitude for D waves is\nproportional to the Legendre function P 02 (cos \u03b8 ) and the\nspin-dependent amplitude for D waves is in proportion to\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8\nP 02 (cos \u03b8 ). Moreover, the S-wave amplitude is independent\nof the scattering angle. Thus, the S- and D-wave amplitudes\ncan be separated out easily.

Thus the amplitudes\nfor the P and F waves can be rewritten as\nMs(P ) = [gP11(1440) + gP11(1710) + gP13(1720)\n+ gP13(1900)]Ms(S), (76)\nMs(F ) = [gF15(1680) + gF15(2000)]Ms(D), (77)\nwith the same method applied in Sec.

We find\nthat gD13(1700), gP13(1900), and gP11(2100) are about an order of\nmagnitude less than those of other resonances. Thus, the\ncontributions of D13(1700), P13(1900), and P11(2100) are\nnegligible.\nThe higher resonances (i.e., n\u0002 3) are treated as degenerate,\nfor they are less important at the energy region near the\nthreshold of the \u03b7N production.\nV. CALCULATIONS AND ANALYSIS\nA. Parameters\nBecause the resonance amplitudes have been obtained, one\ncan calculate the differential cross section with\nd\u03c3\nd\u000e\n= (Ei + Mi)(Ef + Mf )\n64\u03c02s\n|q|\n|k|\n1\n2\n\u2211\n\u03bbi ,\u03bbf\n|M\u03bbf ,\u03bbi |2, (78)\nwhere \u03bbi = \u00b11\/2 and \u03bbf = \u00b11\/2 are the helicities of the\ninitial and final state nucleons, respectively.\nTo take into account the relativistic effects, as done in\nRef. [26], we introduce the Lorentz boost factor in the spatial\npart of the amplitudes, which is\nOi(k,q) \u2192 \u03b3k\u03b3qOi(k\u03b3k,q\u03b3q), (79)\nwhere \u03b3k = Mi\/Ei and \u03b3q = Mf \/Ef .\nIn the calculations, the quark-pseudoscalar-meson cou-\nplings are the overall parameters in the s- and u-channel\ntransitions. However, they are not totally free ones. They can be\nrelated to the hadronic couplings via the Goldberger-Treiman\nrelation [38]:\ngmNN = g\nm\nAMN\nfm\n, (80)\nwhere m denotes the pseudoscalar mesons, \u03c0, \u03b7, etc.; fm is\nthe meson decay constant defined earlier; and gmA is the axial\nvector coupling for the meson.\nThe \u03c0NN coupling g\u03c0NN is a well-determined number:\ng\u03c0NN = 13.48, (81)\nthus we fix it in our calculations. The \u03b7NN coupling is\nthe only free parameter in the present calculations and to\nbe determined by the experimental data. This quantity has\nnot been well established in either experiment or theory. Its\nvalues extracted from different models are still controversial\nand possess large uncertainties. By fitting the data (differential\ncross section) at W \u0001 1524 MeV, we find that our calculations\nfavor a small \u03b7NN coupling around g\u03b7NN = 0.81, which is\ncomparable with those deduced from fitting the\u03b7 photoproduc-\ntion [26,30,41]. The small \u03b7NN coupling is also predicted in\nRefs. [42\u201347]. In contrast, the \u03b7NN coupling derived here\nis much smaller than those used\/predicted in Refs. [48\u201352],\nwhich are in a range of g\u03b7NN = 4 \u223c 9. It should be noted that\nwe do not expect that one parameter fitting can provide an over-\nall description of the experimental data. Therefore, we consider\nonly the data at W \u0001 1524 MeV as a reasonable constraint\non the g\u03b7NN and calculation results with W > 1524 MeV\nas a prediction. For the a0\u03c0\u03b7 and a0NN couplings we adopt\na commonly used value ga0NNga0\u03c0\u03b7 = 100 in the calculation\n[39,40].\nThere are other two overall parameters, mq and \u03b1, from the\nquark model. In the calculation we adopt their standard values\nin the the quark model,\nmq = 330 MeV, (82)\n\u03b12 = 0.16 GeV2. (83)\nFor those s-channel resonances that generally have a\nbroad width, the treatment for their widths to be constants\nis not appropriate. Thus, we take the final-state-momentum-\ndependent width [23,24,29,30]:\n\f(q) = \fR\n\u221a\ns\nMR\n\u2211\ni\nxi\n( |qi |\n|qRi |\n)2l+1\nD(qi)\nD\n(\nqRi\n) , (84)\nwhere |qRi | = [(M2R \u2212 M20 + m2i )\/4M2R \u2212 m2i ]1\/2 and |qi | =\n[(s \u2212 M20 + m2i )\/4s \u2212 m2i ]1\/2, xi is the branching ratio of the\nresonance decaying into a meson with mass mi and a nucleon,\nand \fR is the total decay width of the s-channel resonance\nwith mass MR.D(q) = e\u2212q2\/3\u03b12 is a fission barrier function.\nWe adopt the PDG values for the resonance masses and\nwidths [37], which are listed in Table II.

Differential cross section\nIn Fig. 2, the differential cross sections together with\nthe partial differential cross sections for several individual\nresonances are shown at different center-of-mass energies from\nthreshold W = 1.488 GeV to W = 1.586 GeV. The experi-\nmental data [4,6,7,9,11] are also included for a comparison.\nFrom the figure, we can see that the calculation results\nagree well with the data as shown by the solid curves. The\nS11(1535) governs the differential cross sections from the \u03b7N\nthreshold to W = 1.586 GeV, as indicated by the straight lines\nin Figs. 2(1b)\u20132(12b). The S11(1650) has significant destruc-\ntive interferences with the S11(1535) in the region of W \u0001\n1.586 GeV [see the dash-dotted curves in Figs. 2(1b)\u20132(12b)].\nIf we switch off the D13(1520), as illustrated by the\ndashed curves in Figs. 2(7a)\u20132(12a), we find that the shape of\nthe differential cross sections changes significantly. It shows\nthat the interference between D13(1520) and S11(1535) are\ncrucial to produce the correct shape for the differential cross\nsection around the \u03b7N threshold. This feature is mentioned in\nRefs. [40,53], and a similar feature also appears in photopro-\nduction reactions [30,41,42,54,55].\nThe nucleon pole term contributions are visible in\nthe differential cross sections [see the dash-dotted curves\nFigs. 2(1a)\u20132(12a)]. Due to its interference, the differential\ncross sections are enhanced in the region of W <\u223c 1.53 GeV\nand suppressed in the region of W >\u223c 1.54 GeV by the nucleon\npole.\nTo see the effects from the t channel, we also show the\ndifferential cross sections without the contributions of it, which\nare denoted by the dashed curves in Figs. 2(1b)\u20132(12b). In the\nregion of W < 1.586 GeV, we find that the contributions from\nt channel are very small. Basically, its effects on the differential\ncross sections are negligible in this region.\nFIG. 2.

Interestingly, a \u201csecond peak\u201d around\nW \u223c 1.7 GeV appears in the total cross section, which is also\npredicted by other models [12,16,17].\nAround the threshold, W < 1.6 GeV (i.e., p\u03c0 < 0.9 GeV),\nwe can see that the major contributions to the cross sections\nare from the S11(1535) and S11(1650). The contributions of\nthe S11(1535) is about an order of magnitude larger than those\nfrom the P -, D-, and F -wave resonances. In this region, it\nshows that the exclusive cross section from S11(1535) is even\nlarger than the data. But the destructive interferences from the\nS11(1650) bring down the cross sections.\nFor W > 1.6 GeV, the contributions of n = 2 resonances\nappear in the reaction. They play important roles around W =\n1.7 GeV. Without the contributions from the n = 2 shell, the\n\u201csecond peak\u201d disappears. To know which resonance in the\nn = 2 shell contributes to the \u201csecond peak,\u201d we should rely\non partial-wave analysis. It will be discussed in Sec. V D.\nThere are nearly no contributions from D13(1700),\nD15(1675), and D13(1520) in the whole energy region. We\nshould emphasize that, although there are less contributions of\nD13(1520) to the total cross sections, it plays important roles\nin the reactions to give a correct shape for the differential cross\nsections.\nFrom the exclusive cross section of t channel, we find that\nthe t channels are negligible to the cross section as shown in\nFig. 3(A). Switching off the the contributions from the nucleon\npole terms, we find that the total cross section changes by\nless than 20% in in the region of W <\u223c 1.6 GeV; however, it\ndecreases significantly in the region of W > 1.7 GeV [see the\ndotted curve in Fig. 3(B)].\nA recent analysis of \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n data suggests the need of\nthe P11(1710) resonance [56,57]. In the following subsection,\nwe will discuss those higher resonance contributions briefly.\nD. Higher resonances from n = 2 shell\nFrom the analysis in Secs. V B and V C, we infer that\nwhen the center-of-mass energy W < 1.6 GeV, the data can\nbe accounted for with the resonances of n\u0001 1. To clarify the\nrole played by the higher resonances, i.e., the P - and F -wave\nstates in the n = 2 shell, we make an analysis of the differential\ncross sections in the energy region W > 1.6 GeV, where the\nP11(1710), P13(1720), and F15(1680) may become important.\nFirst, to see the contributions from individual resonances\n[i.e., P11(1440), P11(1710), P13(1720), P13(1900), P11(2100),\nF15(1680), F15(2000), and F17(1990)] we plot their partial\ncross sections as function of energy in Fig. 4. It shows that the\nP11(1710) resonance is dominant over other states aroundW \u223c\n1.6 \u2212 1.77 GeV. Although the contributions of the P13(1720)\nand F15(1680) resonances are visible, they are about 5 \u223c 10\ntimes smaller than those of the P11(1710) resonance. There\nare nearly no contributions from the P13(1900), P11(1440),\nand F17(1990) resonances in n = 2 in this energy region. We\nthen conclude that to reproduce the \u201csecond peak\u201d in Fig. 3 we\nneed the P11(1710) resonance, which is consistent with other\nstudies in the literature [56,57].\nIn Fig. 5, the differential cross sections at W =\n1.609, 1.657, and 1.670 GeV are presented. It shows that\n065205-9\nXIAN-HUI ZHONG, QIANG ZHAO, JUN HE, AND BIJAN SAGHAI PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 065205 (2007)\nFIG. 4. The partial cross sections for the resonances in the n = 2\nshell are shown. All the Breit-Wigner masses and widths for the\nresonances are taken from the PDG values. For the P11(1710)\nresonance, the result with a broader width \f = 350 MeV is also\nshown. In the n = 2 shell, only the P11(1710), F15(1680), and\nP13(1720) resonances contribute to the cross sections in an obvious\nway. The other resonances, such as, P13(1990) and P11(1440),\ncontribute almost nothing to the cross sections.\nwithout the P11(1710), F15(1680), and P13(1720) resonances,\nthe changes to the differential cross section are rather signifi-\ncant. We find that the theoretical predictions overestimate the\ncross sections at backward angles, while they underestimate\nthe cross sections at forward angles, compared with the data.\nBecause there are still large uncertainties with the width of\nthe P11(1710) (i.e., \f = 50 \u223c 450 MeV) [12,37], we thus\nadjust it to examine the model predictions. By setting width\nas \f = 350 MeV, we find that the predictions at W = 1.657\nand 1.670 GeV are improved obviously (see the dotted curves\nin Fig. 5). It should be noted that with \f = 350 MeV for the\nFIG. 5. (Color online) The differential cross sections for W =\n1.609, 1.657, and 1.670 GeV, respectively (solid curves). Data are\nfrom Ref. [4] (open circles). The dashed curves are for the prediction\nwithout the n = 2 shell resonances. The dash-dotted curves are for the\ncase when we reverse the sign of the partial amplitude for P11(1710).\nP11(1710), its partial cross sections decrease significantly, and\nits contributions becomes comparable with those of P13(1720)\nand F15(1680) (see Fig. 4). Although the predictions are\nimproved by using a broader width for P11(1710), there still\nexists a big gap between the theoretical predictions and the\ndata.\nInterestingly, the data seem to favor that the contribution\nfrom the P11(1710) resonance has a reversed sign as shown by\nthe dash-dotted curves. It also improves the parameter fitting.\nThis could be a signal for the breakdown of the SU(6) \u2297 O(3)\nsymmetry within the P -wave states. A similar example is the\nradial excited P11(1440) of [56, 28], which is lighter than the\nfirst orbital excited S11(1535) and suggests the breakdown of\nthe nonrelativistic constituent quark model (NRCQM) [33].\nIt has also been discussed in the literature that the P11(1710)\nresonance could be a candidate for the 1\/2+ pentaquark with\nhidden strangeness [58]. It was shown in Ref. [59] that a\npossible mixture of the [20, 28] within the P -wave states can\nbreak down the naive quark model symmetry and make their\nproperties very different from the NRCQM expectations. Our\npresent study certainly does not allow us to conclude the nature\nof the P11(1710). But the results seem to show that the data\nfavor a strong P -wave contribution with a reversed sign in\nrespect of the P11(1710) resonance around W \u223c 1.7 GeV,\nfor which the source should be investigated. Polarization\nobservables in this energy region may be sensitive to its\ninterference and a partial-wave analysis of data should be\npursued.\nVI. SUMMARY\nWe have extended the chiral quark-model approach for\nmeson photoproduction on nucleon to the study of meson\nproduction in meson-nucleon scatterings. An major advantage\nof this approach is that the number of free parameters will\nbe greatly reduced in the quark model as the leading-order\ncalculation. For the reaction \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n at low energies,\nwe succeed in accounting for the differential and total cross\nsections from threshold to the third resonance region.\nIn this study, we find that the S11(1535) and S11(1650)\ndominate the reaction in a wide energy region above the\nthreshold. Although contributions from the D13(1520) and\nnucleon pole terms are relatively small near threshold, they\nare crucial to produce the correct shape of the differential\ncross sections via interferences. In particular, the S11(1650)\nhas a destructive interference with the S11(1535) near thresh-\nold, and the D13(1520) is crucial to produce the angular\ndistributions. The t-channel contributions are negligible in the\nreactions. Above the center-of-mass energy W \u223c 1.6 GeV,\nthe contributions of higher resonances from n = 2 shell also\nappear. The P11(1710) plays an important role around the\ncenter-of-mass energy W = 1.7 GeV, which contributes to\nthe bump around W = 1.7 GeV in the total cross section.\nIt turns out that a sign change for the P11(1710) resonance\nwill better account for the data. This could be a sign for the\nbreakdown of the NRCQM and state mixings are needed.\nIt may also be a signal of unconventional configurations\ninside the P11(1710) for which both improved experimental\nmeasurement and theoretical phenomenology are required.\n065205-10\nTHE \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b7n REACTION AT LOW . . .
