Over the last 25 years, organisational justice has become one of the \nmost popular research areas in organisational behaviour, and has contributed to our \nunderstanding of people\u2019s experiences and reactions in work contexts (Colquitt et al. 2005b). \nJustice perceptions have been shown to have effects on people\u2019s motivation, well-being, \nperformance, attitudes, behaviours and other outcomes relevant for organisations and \norganisational members (Folger and Cropanzano 1998). Since a wave of reviews and meta-\nanalyses of justice in 2001 (Cohen-Charash and Spector 2001; Colquitt et al. 2001; \nCropanzano et al. 2001a; Cropanzano et al. 2001b), the face of organisational justice has \nchanged again, and many of these changes have been reported in the recent handbook of \norganisational justice (Colquitt et al. 2005a). As pointed out in previous reviews, there is still \na maze of ideas within organisational justice, and it can be difficult to identify the major \nissues and directions within this maze (Cropanzano and Greenberg 1997). In this review, I \nwill argue that four areas of recent research interest are particularly critical for the future of \nthe field: concept clarification, the integration of social context, understanding justice \ndynamics over time, and the links between organisational justice and morality. Before \ndiscussing in more depth why these areas are important, what our current state of knowledge \nis, and how research and theory could be developed in these areas, I will give a brief general \noverview of the field of organisational justice. This brief overview firstly introduces what \norganisational justice is, then reviews current theories of organisational justice, and finally \npresents the effects of justice. \n \n 3 \nWhat is Organisational Justice? Definition and Dimensions \nThe social science definition of organisational justice is based on people\u2019s \nperceptions, such that an act is just because someone perceives it to be just. This differs from \nphilosophical justice concepts where an act is just when it complies with a normative \nethical\/philosophical system.  In philosophy and ethics, different normative rule systems \ndetermine what is just or unjust (Colquitt et al. 2001). While organisational justice needs to \nbe distinguished from the philosophical justice concept, it remains related to the field of \nnormative justice theories in various ways. (For an early review, see Greenberg and Bies \n1992).   \n \u201cAt its most general level, organizational justice is an area of psychological \ninquiry that focuses on perceptions of fairness in the workplace. It is the psychology of justice \napplied to organizational settings\u201d (Byrne and Cropanzano 2001: 4). The organisational \njustice framework helps to investigate individuals\u2019 experience of different aspects of their \nemployment. While the first contributions centred around the perceived fairness of outcomes \nonly (distributive justice), further new dimensions were added, including the fairness of the \nprocedures used to determine outcomes (procedural justice), respectful and sensitive \ntreatment (interpersonal justice), and adequate and sufficient communication (informational \njustice) (see Folger and Cropanzano 1998). The terms \u2018justice\u2019 and \u2018fairness\u2019 are used \ninterchangeably in this field (see for example Cohen-Charash and Spector 2001; French 1964; \nSheppard et al. 1992). \nOrganisational justice as a field in social science is rooted in a few seminal papers in \nthe 1960s, focusing on the equitable distribution of outcomes in social interactions (Adams \n1965; Blau 1964; Homans 1961). The term \u2018organisational justice\u2019 was first used by French \nin 1964 to refer in general to fairness issues in personnel management (French 1964), but it \nwas Greenberg who first used the term specifically to refer to people\u2019s perceptions of fairness \n 4 \n(Greenberg 1987). In the recently published handbook of organisational justice, the history of \njustice is categorised into the distributive, procedural, interactional and integrative \u201cwaves\u201d \n(Colquitt et al. 2005b), which are closely aligned with the introduction of different justice \ndimensions. The following sections give an overview of the dimensions of organisational \njustice that are commonly distinguished today:  \nDistributive Justice \nDistributive justice is the perceived fairness of outcome distributions (Adams \n1965; Leventhal 1976a). Typical outcomes that are distributed in the general employment \ncontext are, for example, pay, benefits or redundancies. According to distributive justice \nresearch, a distribution is perceived to be fair if it is consistent with chosen norms of \nallocation.  \nEarly contributions focused on the equity norm of allocation, according to which \noutcomes should be distributed in proportion to merit (Homans 1961). Adams (1965) \nformalised equity in exchange relationships in his \u201cequity theory\u201d which posits that people \ncompare their own input\/outcome ratio to the other person\u2019s input\/outcome ratio. If the ratios \nare unequal, then inequity is perceived. A person who perceives their own ratio to be lower \nthan the \u201cjust ratio\u201d is predicted to feel guilty; a person who perceives their own ratio to be \nhigher is predicted to feel angry. People strive to remove the unpleasant state of inequity, \neither by altering inputs or outcomes, by cognitive distortion of inputs or outcomes, by \nleaving the exchange relationship, by altering the other\u2019s inputs or outcomes, or by changing \nthe object of comparison.  \nSubsequently, other distribution rules such as equality and need were introduced \n(e.g., Deutsch 1975; Leventhal 1976b; Sampson 1975). The equality rule defines the same \noutcome for all as fair. A need-based allocation distributes outcomes proportionate to the \nneed of individuals. Lerner (1974) pointed out that different types of relationships call for \ndifferent rules of distribution. The rule of equality is often used among friends, while the rule \n 5 \nof need is more likely to be used in close relationships, where people identify and have \nempathy with each other. Individual rules may be more or less influential depending on \ncontext, goals and motives, and a number of rules could be considered simultaneously \n(Leventhal 1976a).  \nProcedural Justice \nThe second category of fairness is procedural justice, which refers to the fairness \nof the process that leads to outcomes. This dimension was introduced by Thibaut and Walker \n(1975), who conducted their research in courtroom settings and distinguished the fairness of \nthe verdict from the fairness of the process leading to the verdict. They investigated the role \nof process control (being able to voice one\u2019s opinion during the procedure) and decision \ncontrol (the ability to influence the outcome). In simulated dispute-resolution procedures, \nprocess control was shown to increase acceptance and fairness perception of verdicts, even if \nthe outcome could not be influenced. This finding has become known as the \u201cvoice \nphenomenon\u201d. Consequently, procedural justice was transferred into a non-legal context by \nLeventhal (1980). Leventhal identified six criteria of perceived procedural fairness. Typically, \nprocedures are perceived to be \u201cfair\u201d when they are consistent across people and over time, \nfree of bias, accurate (relying on good information), contain mechanisms for correcting \nwrong decisions, adhere to prevalent conceptions of morality, and are \u201crepresentative\u201d (i.e., \ntake into account opinions of all groups affected), which implies process control and decision \ncontrol. The voice phenomenon has been confirmed in a number of contexts, such as citizen \nencounters with police officers, or students and their teachers (Lind and Tyler 1988), and \nperformance appraisals (Greenberg 1990). This research relied largely on survey methods.  \nThe introduction of procedural justice led to researchers starting to employ a \nmodel consisting of two dimensions of fairness: distributive and procedural.  \n \n 6 \nInteractional Justice \nInteractional justice was introduced as a third dimension of justice by Bies and \ncolleagues (Bies and Moag 1986; Bies and Shapiro 1987; Bies and Shapiro 1988; Bies et al. \n1988), who claimed that people also judge the fairness of the interpersonal treatment they \nreceive as organisational procedures are enacted (Bies and Moag, 1986). Former models had \neither confounded the issue of formal procedures with concerns about interpersonal treatment, \nor neglected interactional aspects altogether (Bies and Moag, 1986; Bies, 1987). Early \nresearch suggested four central concerns of interactional fairness: truthfulness (honesty), \njustification (explanations), respect (politeness) and propriety (no prejudicial statements or \nimproper questions) (Bies 1987; Bies and Moag 1986). These elements have been confirmed \nin a number of contexts, such as recruitment (Bies 1986), or police and courtroom \ninteractions (Tyler 1988). \nGreenberg proposed to split interactional justice into two main elements: the quality \nof treatment (respect and sensitivity), and explanations and information regarding decision-\nmaking (Greenberg 1993). These two elements were consequently treated as separate \ndimensions of justice by some authors (Colquitt 2001)  and were named informational justice \nand interpersonal justice.  \nInterpersonal justice regards the quality of personal treatment, respect and sensitivity \n(Greenberg 1990). Honesty, respect and politeness generally increase interpersonal justice \nperceptions (Colquitt et al. 2001). According to Bies (2001), the concerns regarding \ninterpersonal treatment  include everyday encounters, not just the ones in formal decision \nmaking contexts. Thus, a wide number of treatments such as deception, invasion of privacy, \nderogatory judgments and disrespect, may fall into the scope of interpersonal justice (Roch \nand Shanock 2006). \nInformational justice focuses on the amount and quality of information provided \nconcerning procedures and outcomes (Colquitt 2001; Greenberg 1990). Clarity, adequacy and \n 7 \nsincerity of communications regarding a decision are important antecedents of informational \njustice. A meta-analytic review found that explanations had the strongest beneficial effects on \npeople\u2019s reactions when they were excuses rather than justifications, when they were given \nafter unfavourable outcomes, and when they were given in contexts with instrumental, \nrelational and moral implications (Shaw et al. 2003). \nThe construct discrimination debate \nThe question of whether we should distinguish two, three or four dimensions of \njustice has been debated at surprising length within the justice literature. Some authors have \nargued that interactional justice elements (interpersonal and informational) form part of \nprocedural justice (e.g.,  Sweeney and McFarlin 1993; Tyler and Bies 1990). According to \nthis view, procedural justice judgments include considerations of structure and quality of \ntreatment and there is no need for a separate interactional construct (e.g., Lind and Tyler \n1988).  \nBobocel and Holmvall (2001) provide a summary of research on the difference \nbetween procedural and interpersonal justice. Overall, this review points towards the \npossibility that both types of justice are distinct. As different definitions and \noperationalisations are possible, additional variance might be explained and antecedents are \nlikely to differ. The authors refrain from any final conclusions and recommend that a wider \nvariety of research methodologies be employed to improve our insights into the phenomenon \nof organisational justice, specifically utilising longitudinal methods and distinguishing clearly \nbetween the constructs of interactional and procedural justice.  \nRecent meta-analyses of research (Cohen-Charash and Spector 2001; Colquitt et \nal. 2001) also argue for a separation of procedural from interactional justice based on the \nlevel of correlations among the three types of justice, as well as on the different relationships \nthey have with their correlates. This is also the view put forward in the recent review by Bies \n(2005). \n 8 \nMuch less conclusive evidence exists regarding the question of whether the two \nelements of interactional justice, namely interpersonal treatment and the provision of \nadequate and timely information, should be treated as separate dimensions or not. The study \nby Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter and Ng (2001) is the only meta-analysis of \norganisational justice differentiating between these elements. Their review of 183 justice \nstudies finds that procedural, interpersonal and informational justice have different correlates, \nand measuring the three separately explains incremental variance in fairness perceptions. \nFurther support for the existence of four distinct justice dimensions is given in Colquitt\u2019s \nstudy (2001), which developed and validated measures for the four dimensions of fairness. A \nfour-factor model fits the data better than one, two or three-factor models.  \nAt present, we have only a very small pool of informational justice studies to draw \nconclusions from. \u201cOnly studies separating clearly between four elements will further our \nunderstanding of these issues, whether there are four dimensions of organisational justice, or \nthree dimensions and explanations\/excuses as antecedent\u201d (Paterson et al. 2002, 395). \nThe global justice construct \nSince the reviews in 2001, increased attention has been paid to organisational justice \nas a global construct, including all of its dimensions. Colquitt and colleagues term this phase \nthe \u201cintegrative wave\u201d of justice research (Colquitt et al. 2005b).  \nCropanzano and Ambrose (2001) have discussed the advantages of a monistic view \nof justice that combines the different dimensions of organisational justice into one. This \nperspective is based on the fact that procedural evaluations are often largely based on \noutcomes, and that the same event could be a process in one context and an outcome in \nanother context. For example, a policy change can be the outcome of a negotiation, but the \nnew policy may be seen to impact upon future procedural fairness. Receiving increased and \nbetter information may be an outcome in itself, but it also forms part of informational \nfairness. Colquitt (2001), who is a central proponent of the four-dimensional model, also \n 9 \nacknowledges that some individuals may view justice as one single factor only. This might \ncontribute to the high correlations between procedural and distributive justice that have been \nfound in some studies. \nIn a more recent review, Ambrose and Arnaud (2005, 78) argue that the \ninterdependence of distributive and procedural justice is too often ignored and they see \u201cthe \nmajority of contemporary justice research as focusing on \u2018within justice\u2019 questions\u201d. \nResearch that considers overall fairness as well as other psychological constructs might \ncontribute more to our understanding than research focusing on individual dimensions of \nfairness and their relationship to each other.  \n \nTheories of Organisational Justice \nThe two main questions that general justice theories have tried to answer are (1) why \nfairness matters to people and (2) how fairness judgments are made. Both questions are \nimportant for our understanding of organisational fairness, and they may be interrelated: the \nmotivation for taking justice into account may impact how justice judgments are made. These \ntwo types of theory have been termed \u201cprocess theories\u201d and \u201ccontent theories\u201d in the review \nby Cropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel and Rupp (2001). A third issue that has received increased \nattention since the 2001 reviews is why and how people react to their fairness perceptions. \nRecent integrative theories have a bearing on all three of the questions of how and why \nfairness judgments are made, and why people react to fairness judgments (Blader and Tyler \n2005). In the following section, I will firstly review the motives of justice, or why people care \nabout fairness, before presenting three of the most popular and widely applicable theories of \norganisational justice.  \n 10 \nJustice motives: why people make fairness judgments \nDifferent explanations have been brought forward for why people care about justice \nor fairness (for a detailed review, see Cropanzano et al. 2001b). \nAccording to the instrumental model, individuals are concerned about fairness \nbecause it is a control mechanism to ensure predictability and favourability of their (long-\nterm) outcomes (Tyler 1987). An alternative explanation has been given by Lind and Tyler \n(1988). Their group-value model, later named relational model, postulates that individuals \ncare about fairness because receiving fair treatment indicates status and worth within a group. \nYet the previous models do not explain why people are concerned with justice even when \nthere is no direct economic benefit and only strangers are involved. Folger (1998) reasoned \nthat there must be yet another reason why people care about justice. He argues that people can \nsee virtue as a value in itself. It is also an expression of human dignity: a moral virtues model \nof justice.  \nFolger expanded on his moral virtues model, sketching a \u201cdeontic theory of \nfairness\u201d (Folger 2001). This theory acknowledges multiple interests: The presence of selfish \nmotives does not preclude concerns for others at the same time. Multiple interests mean that \none of them cannot hold absolute sway. But all injustice experiences constitute negative \ntransgression experiences, involving some type of pain, which is held to apply equally to \nourselves and even to complete strangers.  \nAnother attempt to integrate the three different types of content theories has been \nmade by Cropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel and Rupp (2001a), who argue that the three motives of \njustice fulfill different psychological needs: the instrumental motive corresponds to the need \nfor control, the relational motive to the needs for belonging and self-esteem, and the virtue \nmotive to the need for a meaningful existence. These different needs could be seen as \ndifferent forms of self-interest: interest in economic outcomes, in interpersonal outcomes, and \n 11 \nthe interest in protecting one\u2019s self-image or in avoiding feelings of guilt (Schminke and \nAmbrose 1997).  \n Gillespie and Greenberg (2005) propose that the ultimate goal of fairness is \nbelonging. This is achieved through the more concrete goals of fair relationships with entities \nand fairness in events. Similar arguments have been brought forward for trust and \nuncertainty\/security as the ultimate goal of justice (Colquitt et al. 2005a). These views have \nin common that there is a hierarchy of goals, with an ultimately self-interested goal at the top. \nA recent review of self-interest as a human motive disagrees with this, arguing that other \nmotives exist, notably empathy and moral duty (Cropanzano et al. 2005a). Cropanzano and \ncolleagues argue that some acts are simply intended to benefit another person. The goal of \nbelonging can for example not explain experimental evidence showing that individuals are \nwilling to sacrifice financial self-interest in reaction to unfairness, even when there is no \nmaterial or symbolic benefits, and even when they and the victim are in different social \ngroups, or there are no future opportunities to interact with either the victim or the \ntransgressor (Turillo et al. 2002).  \nTo summarise, we have little clarity on what the ultimate goal of justice is, and \nwhether there are altruistic goals of justice or only self-interested goals. However, we do \nknow that people care about fairness for a number of reasons, and these include instrumental, \nrelational and moral concerns.  \nIntegrative Theories of Organisational Justice \nThe most recent phase of organisational justice research, which has been termed the \n\u201cintegrative wave\u201d (Colquitt et al. 2005b), has brought forward theories that can relate to \nvarious dimensions of justice (Colquitt and Greenberg 2001), and that can add insights into \ndifferent aspects of justice, such as how and why justice judgments are made, and how and \nwhy people react to justice. The theories build on three types of approaches: Fairness Theory \n 12 \nbuilds on counterfactual thinking, Uncertainty Management builds on heuristic mechanisms, \nand the Group Engagement Model builds on social identity processes.  \nFairness theory rests on the ideas and findings of counterfactual thinking. \nResearch has shown that, in many situations, individuals judge their own treatment and \noutcomes on the basis of how well off others are and how well off they themselves could be. \nFairness theory holds that people examine three counterfactuals when they make justice \njudgments and try to assign blame: \u201cwould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d and \u201cshould\u201d (Folger and Cropanzano \n2001). Blame is only assigned for unjust behaviour if an unfavourable condition (event or \nnon-event) has occurred (\u201cwould\u201d it be better otherwise?), the harm-doer has acted with \ndiscretion (\u201ccould\u201d he or she have acted in a different way?), and the action has violated an \nethical principle (\u201cshould\u201d he or she have acted differently?). This theory also helps to \nexplain reactions to injustice, and how various factors may need to be present simultaneously \nin order to evoke negative reactions towards a decision maker. However, further empirical \nsupport is necessary to strengthen and clarify the predictions from fairness theory. Novel \nbehaviours are likely to induce counterfactual thinking, as it is easy to imagine an alternative \nfor an unexpected or novel action: the obvious alternative is the status quo or the \u2018normal\u2019 \nexpected behaviours. Due to its focus on blame, fairness theory is particularly useful for \nexplaining negative reactions towards individuals or organisations.  \nFairness heuristics theory departs from a different logic: the \u201cfundamental social \ndilemma\u201d (Lind 2001a). By identifying with, and contributing to, a social group, people can \nimprove their chances of achieving goals and enhancing their self-worth and social meaning. \nHowever, sacrifices for, and identification with, a group can limit freedom of action and one \nbecomes vulnerable to rejection and exploitation. The decision whether to cooperate is thus \nan important and consequential one. When we don\u2019t know whether another party is \ntrustworthy, then we use general justice heuristics to decide quickly whether to cooperate or \n 13 \nnot. This theory assumes that people use justice judgments as cognitive shortcuts that can \nhelp them to decide how to act at any time. Once the general fairness judgment (the \u2018fairness \nheuristic\u2019) is built, people try to interpret all incoming fairness information in a way as to \nmake it compatible to the heuristic. According to this theory, the fairness heuristics change \nonly when there are either signs of changing relationship, or unexpected or irreconcilable \ntreatment (Lind 2001a). Fairness heuristics theory stresses the role of information availability. \nIt is assumed that when the most relevant information is not available, people use other \ninformation to assess what is fair and how to react to the situation: the heuristic \nsubstitutability principle (Van den Bos 2001).  \nFairness heuristics theory departed from uncertainty about trust and was later \nbroadened to include other types of uncertainty in the uncertainty management model. This \nmodel describes how fairness-related information can remove uncertainty and mitigate the \ndiscomfort of uncertainty, even if fairness experiences are not related to uncertainty (Lind and \nVan den Bos 2002; Van den Bos and Lind 2002). These models may be particularly helpful in \norder to explain relationship judgments over time.  \nWhile fairness theory and fairness heuristics theory focus mainly on how people make \nfairness judgments, the group engagement model by Tyler and Blader (2000; 2003) deals \nwith the question of what makes individuals cooperate in groups, organisations and societies. \nThis model argues that identity judgments are the primary factors shaping cooperative \nbehaviour in groups, and that identity variables mediate the link between justice and \ncooperation: the social identity mediation hypothesis (Blader and Tyler 2005). Specifically, \nprocedural and interactional justice from supervisors and from the organisation drive identity \njudgments, which in turn influence engagement. Important identity-related variables are the \nstatus, or standing, of the group (pride) and one\u2019s status within the group (respect). These will \nshape the extent to which employees define themselves as members of the group \n 14 \n(identification). The main impact of resource judgments (shaped by distributive justice and \noutcome favourability) on psychological and behavioural engagement is also an indirect one, \nvia identity judgments. \nEmpirical tests support these predictions (Tyler and Blader 2000, 2002). However, \nthere are alternative explanations for the links between justice and cooperation to be \ninvestigated further (e.g., social exchange and attribution approaches), and so far we do not \nhave sufficient evidence to claim specific causalities. For example, while the theory proposes \nthat positive fairness perceptions lead to high levels of identification with the group, it is \nequally feasible that high levels of group identification promote positive fairness perceptions \n(Blader, 2002). \nIn particular, the group engagement model is suited to explain positive attitudes and \nvalues, and cooperative behaviour within social contexts. Fairness heuristic theory and \nfairness theory do not explicitly link justice and cooperation (Blader and Tyler 2005).  \nWe do not know whether one of these theories explains overall fairness dynamics \nbetter than the others. More likely, the suitability of any one of the presented theories may \ndepend on boundary factors. Cropanzano and colleagues proposed in their review that the \ntype of fairness processing may depend on the availability of information, on time pressure \nand on cognitive resources available (Cropanzano et al. 2001a). They have classified process \ntheories of justice on a controlled-automatic continuum. When a careful evaluation of all \ninformation leads to a deliberate fairness judgment, the process is said to be controlled, while \na quick judgment without deliberate or conscious attention that relies on readily available \ninformation is labelled automatic processing. Controlled or systematic processing may be \nmost appropriate when there are time and cognitive resources available (Cropanzano et al. \n2001a). In other situations, these cognitive resources are not available and people may \nprocess automatically instead.  \n 15 \nHowever, as argued by Lind (2001b), the theories propose different logics, and a different  \nprocessing context does not necessarily imply that people will switch from one logic to \nanother (e.g., from social comparisons to moral transgressions and blame). To underline this \npoint, Lind cites empirical evidence for heuristics use (a supposedly \u201clow processing capacity \nroute\u201d) when plenty of processing capacity is available.  \nA more useful distinction among the different theories of justice may be the one \nproposed by Taylor (2001), who differentiates theories according to whether they are focused \non a) adverse outcomes or the source responsible for the outcomes, or b) concerned with a \nsingle event or a relationship over time. She classifies fairness theory as relating to \nunfavourable outcomes (reactions to unfairness), and to one off events, with a focus on the \nactor to whom blame is assigned rather than on the event itself. Fairness heuristics theory on \nthe other hand relates to the source responsible for outcomes (a relationship) over time, as the \nheuristic is relatively stable, and so is the identity judgment in the group engagement model.  \nHowever, current theorizing does not give any detailed account of how judgments of \nboth positive and negative events are connected to entity judgments over time, and which \nprocessing considerations are salient under which conditions (referent comparison, identity \nconsiderations, heuristics use).  Longer term or cumulative effects of processing justice \njudgments have so far only been proposed tentatively (e.g., Greenberg and Wiethoff 2001), \nand empirical evidence is lacking. \n \nJustice effects  \nA great deal of research has investigated the consequences of perceived justice or \ninjustice. The findings repeatedly indicate a significant impact of organisational justice on \nbehavioural, attitudinal and organisational outcomes.  \n 16 \nSome of the most widely researched areas have been outcome satisfaction (e.g., \nFolger and Konovsky 1989; Lowe and Vodanovich 1995; Sweeney and McFarlin 1993), job \nsatisfaction (e.g., Masterson et al. 2000; Singer 1993), organisational commitment (e.g., \nFolger and Konovsky 1989; Lowe and Vodanovich 1995; Sweeney and McFarlin 1993), trust \n(Konovsky and Pugh 1994), evaluation of authority (Lind and Tyler 1988), organisational \ncitizenship behaviours (Masterson et al. 2000), negative reactions (Greenberg 1994) and \nperformance (Greenberg 1988). Studies have also investigated other outcomes, including \nlikelihood of legal action (Bies and Tyler 1993), co-operation (Pfeffer and Langton 1993) or \nexperienced stress (Zohar 1995). \nIn a recent review of behavioural justice effects, Conlon and colleagues differentiate \nbetween \u201cthe good, the bad and the ugly\u201d effects (Conlon et al. 2005). Good effects of justice \njudgments are, for example, task performance and compliance; bad effects (of injustice) \ninclude turnover, absenteeism, and employee withdrawal; and ugly effects are instances of \ncounterproductive behaviour. \nThere is general agreement that fairness perceptions have an impact on attitudinal, \nbehavioural and organisational outcomes, but there is much less clarity about which \ndimensions of fairness influence which types of outcomes, and the relative strength with \nwhich different dimensions of fairness may shape personal and organisational outcomes. \nDifferent models have been brought forward to hypothesise and explain the \nrelationship between dimensions and outcomes. These models have relied mainly on \nindividual studies and anecdotal support until the meta-reviews by Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, \nPorter and Ng (2001) and by Cohen-Charash and Spector (2001) have made a significant \ncontribution to combining and condensing previous findings on the relationship between \nfairness dimensions and outcomes. Only limited support was found for each model, \nsupporting it only for some outcomes, not for others. Thus, there is still a lot we need to find \n 17 \nout about the relationship between the different organisational justice dimensions and various \noutcomes, and in particular there is still a shortfall of research on interpersonal and \ninformational elements of justice.  \nLooking at broader categorisations of behaviour (e.g., withdrawal behaviours or resistance) \nmay further improve the generalisability of findings. Past research has focused on behaviours \non factory floors, while today\u2019s practitioners may need more insight into white-collar \ndeviance (e.g., incivility, sexual harassment and cyber-loafing). Another problem with \noutcome research is that pre-specified forms of expressing reaction to injustice are built into \nmost research, while there is a wide range of possible reactions. Given the current state of \nresearch we are not yet able to predict reactions to injustice (Greenberg 2001b). \nThe fair process and the fair outcome effect \nThe effects of individual justice dimensions have been found to interact with each \nother in various ways. Most research investigating interaction effects has not clearly \ndistinguished between outcome positivity and outcome fairness (Brockner and Wiesenfeld \n1996). Examples of interactions are that procedural justice appears to be more strongly \nrelated to work attitudes when outcomes are low than when they are high. Also, outcomes are \nmore strongly related to work attitudes when procedures are unfair than when procedures are \nfair (Brockner and Wiesenfeld 1996). The \u201cfair process effect\u201d is the finding that people are \nmore satisified with decision outcomes when they get a voice (Folger et al. 1979). Van den \nBos, Wilke, Lind and Vermunt (1998) found that, under fair process conditions, even \nunfavourable outcomes could be perceived as fair. Van den Bos (2001) gave participants \ndifferent types of process or outcome information and either positive or negative outcome \nsatisfaction. The results support the idea that when information about outcomes of others is \nnot available, people tend to use procedural information that is available as a substitute to \nassess how to react to the outcome. In the conditions in which participants knew the outcome \n 18 \nof the other participant, outcome judgments did not differ as a function of whether \nparticipants were or were not allowed voice. In this case the process information was not \nused.  \nWhile this finding is one of the most central findings of the organisational justice \nliterature (for reviews, see Brockner and Wiesenfeld 2005; 1996) there appear to be cases \nwhen the interaction is different. For example, under a prevention focus (avoiding loss) rather \nthan promotion focus (achieving gain), individuals may report least fairness when a bad result \nhas been obtained via fair procedures (Cropanzano et al. 2007). In a promotion focus \n(achieving gain) situation, the fair process pattern holds, and previous experimental research \nhas mostly focused on promotion rather than prevention. Similarly, van den Bos (2002) has \nfound a reversal of the fair process effect when comparison goals rather than interpretation \ngoals were activated. Participants comparing a fair process to an unfair outcome may in fact \nreact even more strongly to the unfair outcomes (Van den Bos 2002). Brockner and \nWiesenfeld (1996) report on the important role that the type of outcome plays: in their \nreview, they found less positive effects of procedural justice when outcome favourability is \nhigh, for self-referenced reactions. The opposite effect was found for authority-referenced \nreactions. The recent list of contributions that found a reversal of the fair process interaction \nsuggests that more research on the context and boundary conditions of justice effects is \nimportant in order to better predict reactions to injustice. \nAn effect of outcomes on process perceptions has also been observed, and was \ntermed the fair outcome effect. Some studies have found a small effect of outcomes on \nprocess perceptions. People perceived the process as less fair when the outcome was \nunfavourable, and as fairer when the outcome was favourable. This assumes that no explicit \ninformation on procedural fairness was available (see Cropanzano et al. 2001a). Van den Bos \n(2001), for example, used an explicit no-voice (participants know that there could be the \n 19 \npossibility of voice) and an implicit no-voice procedure (participants do not know that there is \na possibility for voice). Procedure judgments showed strong interaction effects for implicit \nno-voice. However, there is a scarcity of studies employing other research methods, such as \nfield studies, to show that the effects found in the experiments occur in real-world situations. \nOne of the rare exceptions is a case study by Saunders, Thornhill and Lewis (2002), which \nsupports the general idea of the process-outcome interaction, but identifies some unexpected \nconceptualisations of distributive and procedural justice within this phenomenon. \nThe above research suggests that the impact of different types of fairness may have \nto do with the order in which information is received, and the type of information available. \nWhen information on one dimension is lacking, other dimensions may serve as a proxy to \nestimate fairness. Less or even no interaction effects appear to occur when the information on \neach of the various dimensions is clear and unambiguous. \nFurther interaction effects may exist between the four dimensions of justice. Bies \nand Shapiro (1987) investigated interactions of explanations (informational justice) and other \njustice dimensions in lab and field studies, and found that people with negative outcomes \nwere more likely to accept a procedure as fair when an explanation was offered: an effect \nwhich could be termed a \u201cfair information effect\u201d. The meta-review by Shaw, Wild and \nColquitt (2003) supports these findings: both explanation provision and explanation adequacy \nwere found to be positively related to procedural and distributive justice perceptions. \nCropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel and Rupp (2001a) propose that there are likely to be \nmore than just two-way interactions: outcome, process, interpersonal and informational \nelements could mutually impact each other. So far we know close to nothing about possible \nfour-way interactions between distributive, procedural, interpersonal and informational \njustice. Targeted laboratory studies and further studies measuring all four types of justice may \nbe able to detect additional interactions. \n 20 \nTo summarise, research in numerous settings indicates that perceptions of \ndistributive, procedural, and interpersonal justice have important effects on attitudinal and \nbehavioural outcomes. Outcome favourability and fairness attributes appear to interact in \ncreating justice effects, and the exact nature of justice effects depends on contingency factors, \nmany of which remain to be investigated. \n \nMoving the Organisational Justice Agenda forward: \nThe core concepts, models and questions of organisational justice research have been \nbriefly reviewed in the previous section. The remainder of this review will focus on four \nbroad areas of current research interest which, I shall argue, will be crucial for the future of \nthe field. First, recent developments in justice research allow for increased conceptual clarity, \nwhich will improve our understanding of justice, and promises to increase the consistency \nand internal validity of research. Second, researchers have begun to investigate the important \nrole of social context for justice. Aspects of social context are central moderators of justice \neffects, but have received surprisingly little attention until recently. Third, a few contributions \npoint towards the role of time for justice judgments and effects. Findings are rather tentative \nat this stage, but the integration of the time dimension will be crucial for better predictions of \njustice dynamics and theory development. Fourth, different contributions have shed light on \nthe intersections of justice and morality. Understanding the moral aspects of organisational \njustice at an individual, organisational, and societal level provides new meaning for justice \nresearch, and can help the field to live up to its promises. For each of these four areas, recent \ndevelopments will be reviewed and avenues for future research discussed.  \nConceptual Clarity \nConceptual clarity of the field of organisational justice is increased through \ndifferentiating outcome favourability from distributive justice, separating event judgments \n 21 \nfrom entity judgments, separating justice type and justice source, and through improved \nmeasurement.  \nDifferentiating outcome favourability from distributive justice \nIn general, social exchange theories have shown that people react more positively to \noutcomes that are perceived as beneficial than to negative outcomes (Blau 1964; Homans \n1961). According to these theories, the favourability of outcomes has an effect on reactions \nthat is independent of distributive fairness. Cropanzano and colleagues explain the difference \nbetween outcome favourability and distributive justice as follows: \u201cthe former refers to \nwhether an event is beneficial to a particular respondent, whereas the latter refers to the \nmorality or appropriateness of a given allocation\u201d (Cropanzano et al. 2005b, 1172).   \nYet outcome favourability is not only an additional antecedent of reactions, but may \nalso be an antecedent of distributive justice (Greenberg 1994). This is because people are \nmotivated to perceive self-serving, favourable outcomes as distributively fair. Outcome \nnegativity has been found to be related to distributive justice in a significantly stronger way \nthan to procedural justice (Cohen-Charash and Spector 2001, 293). However, people still \nappear to be distinguishing between outcome favourability and distributive justice in many \ncases. Justice perceptions are not solely explained by egoism, and unfairness to one\u2019s own \nadvantage often provokes unease (Folger and Cropanzano 1998).  \n The meta-analytic review by Skitka, Winquist and Hutchinson (2003) found that, \ngenerally, outcome fairness can be distinguished from outcome favourability. In particular, \nthe fair process effect is weaker when the criterion is distributive justice than when it is \noutcome favourability, and the effect of distributive justice on attitudes is stronger than the \neffect of outcome favourability. Skitka and colleagues conclude that \u201cit is not appropriate to \nconfound or conflate outcome fairness and outcome favourability, nor is it appropriate to \nclaim that one is studying distributive justice when one has only measured or manipulated the \n 22 \nlatter rather than the former\u201d (2003, 329). Despite this, most studies of organisational justice \nhave confounded the effects of outcome favourability and distributive justice. Even very \nrecent lab studies often claim to manipulate distributive justice, when in effect they also \nmanipulate outcome favourability (see, for example, Colquitt et al. 2006; Roberson 2006). \nThe separate effects of outcome favourability and distributive justice have been \ndiscussed, as well as the effects of outcome favourability on distributive justice. Another \npossibility is that interaction effects may exist between outcome favourability and distributive \njustice. The effects between procedural elements of justice and outcome positivity have been \nfound to interact, and a similar pattern may in fact also exist for distributive (in)justice, which \nhas typically been operationalised as (in)equity. Inequity can be either positive or negative. \nNegative inequity is given when perceived outcomes are less than deserved, and positive \ninequity is perceived when outcomes appear to be more than deserved. In past studies, \nfindings on reactions to inequity have been shown to be asymmetric: people were much more \nsensitive to negative inequity than to positive inequity (Greenberg 1982). Although this has \nnot been expressed in interaction terms in the past, it could be seen as a moderating influence \nof outcome favourability on the role of distributive justice. The findings discussed above \nindicate that distributive justice appears to matter more for people\u2019s reactions when outcomes \nare negative. This remains to be tested in further studies that clearly separate outcome \nfavourability from distributive justice. \nEvent versus entity judgments \nA further source of confusion in studies of organisational justice is the differentiation \nbetween events versus entities as targets of justice judgments. Justice judgments can be made \nregarding events (e.g., a particular performance appraisal or a meeting with the supervisor) or \nentities (e.g., the organisation as a whole, the supervisor). In general, people distinguish \n 23 \nbetween long-term behaviour and one-off events, and between evaluations about what \nsomeone does and what someone is like. \nSo far, we know little about how justice judgments of particular events and justice \njudgments regarding particular entities differ, and how they are related to each other. Most \ncommentary on this issue is speculative. In their 2001 review, Cropanzano and colleagues \nproposed an integrative model of justice where events of different types (outcomes, process, \ninterpersonal elements) are linked to event justice perceptions (distributive, procedural, \ninteractional) which in turn are linked to judgments of social entities (distributive, procedural, \ninteractional) (Cropanzano et al. 2001a). Reactions then result from the judgments of social \nentities. The mixed paths and interactions proposed are highly speculative, and moderation \neffects could take place at any stage during the process. The first support for the hypothesized \nmediation of entity judgments has been found by Ambrose, Hess and Ganesan (2007). In a \ncross-sectional survey study of customer complaint handling incidents, they found that event \nattitudes mediate the effect of justice perceptions on system-related attitudes (Ambrose et al. \n2007). The study by Ambrose and colleagues relied on random complaint incidences \nrecounted by passengers while waiting for their flights at an airport, and many of the \nincidents collected may have referred to organisations with which the participants had no \nrelationships previous to the incident related to the complaint. (This could explain the very \nstrong link between overall attitude toward the organisation and satisfaction with complaint \nhandling, of 0.78). However, the initial data by Ambrose and colleagues is promising, and \nlongitudinal research is needed in order to investigate this issue further.  \n Furthermore, processes of justice judgments may differ with regards to events versus \nentities. Cropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel and Rupp (2001a), for example, propose that \ninstrumental concerns and motives may weigh more heavily when looking at entity issues. A \nspecific event, on the other hand, may be judged according to its specific context: a fair entity \n 24 \nmight act unfairly in a specific instance, and vice versa. For empirical designs, this implies \nthat clear and explicit distinctions should be made between the evaluation of entities and of \nspecific events. \n The \u201cencounter perspective\u201d proposed by Bies may be related to the differentiation \nbetween event and entity judgments. Bies (2005) notes that Greenberg\u2019s (1993) taxonomy of \nfour justice dimensions appears to be limited to the exchange context of specific decisions or \nallocations, while some justice concerns may not be directly linked with a specific allocation \ndecision. As examples, he cites advance warnings about possible layoffs, information about \nimpending changes, abusive bosses, broken promises, coercion, insults or a bad working \nenvironment. Therefore, he argues, the scope of justice applications should be expanded to \ntake into account \u201cencounters\u201d, rather than just specific exchange contexts.  \nColquitt, Greenberg and Scott (2005a) argue that the encounter perspective is really \nanalogous to the entity perspective on justice (Cropanzano et al. 2001a), in that overall entity \njudgments will take into account any encounter, while the event perspective looks at distinct \nexchanges. Yet it is not clear how far the two perspectives really map onto each other. For \nentity judgments, both casual encounters and exchanges appear to be relevant, and it remains \nto be investigated whether seemingly unrelated encounter experiences also have an impact on \nevent judgments. Further clarification on this matter would be useful. \nMultifoci justice \nSince a number of reviews of justice were published in 2001 (Cropanzano et al. \n2001a; Cropanzano et al. 2001b), more research has been conducted on what Cropanzano and \ncolleagues called \u201csource effects\u201d (Cropanzano et al. 2001a). It was Blader and Tyler (1999) \nand Byrne and Cropanzano (2000) who first integrated the effects of justice source into their \nthinking. In the past, procedural and distributive justice have typically been operationalised as \nstemming from the organisation as a source, and interactional justice classes as stemming \n 25 \nfrom the supervisor.  However, Byrne and Cropanzano (2000) proposed that the organisation \nand the supervisor could each provide both procedural and interpersonal justice.  \nBlader and Tyler (2000 ) conducted a study that separately investigated system-\noriginated procedural factors and leader-originating procedural factors. These two types \nremained distinct in a confirmatory factor analysis. Consequently, multi-foci models of \norganisational justice that separated justice source from justice content were tested by Rupp \nand Cropanzano (2002). In their study, they measured both supervisor-originating and \norganisation-originating procedural and interactional justice. Some support was found for this \nmulti-foci perspective, as the four resulting factors of justice could be differentiated. \nHowever, the correlations within targets of justice were very high, being 0.79 between \nprocedural and interactional justice perceived from the supervisor, and 0.75 between the \nprocedural and interactional justice referring to the organisation.  The type of justice on the \nother hand was less strong a factor than target of justice, with correlations of 0.36 between the \ntwo types of procedural justice and 0.49 for the two types of interactional justice.  Further, \nRupp and Cropanzano hypothesized that the relationship between multi-foci justice and \nmulti-foci outcomes (e.g., performance and organisational citizenship behaviours) would be \nmediated by social exchanges with the corresponding sources of justice (2002). Their findings \nsupport the predictions more strongly for interpersonal justice than for procedural justice. \nContrary to the predictions, organisational citizenship behaviours directed to the organisation \nwere predicted more strongly through supervisor-focused justice than organisation-focused \njustice.  \nA different mechanism to link justice from different sources to different outcomes was \nproposed by Olkkonen and Lipponen (2006), who take an identity approach. In their model of \nidentification and justice adopting a multi-foci approach, organisation identification and \nwork-unit identification mediate the effects of justice at the organisational level and justice at \n 26 \nthe work-unit level. A cross-sectional survey study provided indication that work-unit and \nidentification may be mediators of the relationships between supervisor-focused interactional \njustice, and work-unit outcomes (extra-role behaviours towards the work unit). Also, the data \nindicates that organisational identification may be mediating the relationship between \norganisation-focused procedural and distributive justice and organisation-focused outcomes \n(i.e., turnover intentions and extra-role behaviours towards the organisation). However, given \nthe cross-sectional nature of the data, the causality of the relationships remains unclear. \nSkitka (2003), for example, found that identification may in turn influence justice \nperceptions. \n So far, there is some evidence that people distinguish between justice emanating \nfrom different sources \u2013 mainly their supervisor and their organisation. There is also some \nindication that the justice perceptions stemming from these sources are differentially linked to \ndifferent outcomes. It is much less clear how these linkages work, which interactions take \nplace, and which mediating effects, such as exchange relationships or identity processes, are \nin place.  \n Recently, co-workers have also been discussed as a source of justice. This would be \na justice effect outside hierarchical authority relationships. Colquitt, Greenberg and Scott \n(2005a) remain sceptical as to whether it makes sense to include this third source of justice in \ninvestigations:  \u201cIn examining this issue beyond hierarchical authority relationships we must \nbe careful not to threaten the construct validity of organisational justice\u201d (Colquitt et al. \n2005a, 596). In particular, construct validity may be threatened when extending justice to co-\nworker effects, as it may be even more difficult to differentiate just behaviour from nice \nbehaviour. While these warnings regarding construct validity are justified, this may be a \nfruitful area for future research and give new insights into justice effects. It remains to be \n 27 \ninvestigated what the non-hierarchical justice effects in the workplace are and how they add \nto different outcomes.  \nResearch recommendations \nTo summarise, conceptual clarity in organisational justice research can be improved \nby differentiating 1) between outcome favourability and distributive justice, 2) between \njudgments regarding events and regarding entities, and 3) between the source and the type of \njustice judgments. These differentiations are important to increase clarity in investigations of \njustice; for example, when manipulating justice in lab studies, or when measuring justice.  \n Measures of distributive justice should be differentiated from measures of outcome \nfavourability (Tyler and Blader 2002). \u201cConflating an unjust outcome with a harmful one \ncreates interpretative problems because it is unclear which concept \u2013 justice or economic \ninterest \u2013 is driving observed relationships\u201d (Cropanzano et al. 2005b, 1172). Measuring both \noutcome favourability and distributive justice in the same studies will give better insights into \nthe correlation of the two. It also shows how much additional variance in dependent variables \nis explained by distributive justice, when controlling for outcome favourability. This practice \nis likely to decrease the amount of unique variance explained by distributive justice, but it \nwill increase research rigour.  \n In their recent review of measuring organisational justice, Colquitt and Shaw raise \nthe need for clearly defining the source of justice in question \u2013 for example, procedural \njustice may refer either to the supervisor or to the organisation (Colquitt and Shaw 2005). \nAdditionally, it is important to define whether the measure should capture justice perceptions \nin a specific context, such as a particular initiative or encounter, or whether general justice \nperceptions are of interest.  The differentiation between justice perceptions regarding a \nspecific event, versus perceptions regarding an entity (e.g., justice of a supervisor or an \norganisation in general) is related to this choice of measure context. Generally, justice \n 28 \nmeasures should be adapted to the context, and it should be clear whether events or entities \nare measured. More studies, including both event and entity measures, could help \nunderstanding the relationship between both types of judgments. Further studies are also \nneeded to shed more light on the multi-foci models of justice, and may also include justice \nfrom the part of co-workers. Of course, for some research questions and in some contexts, \nonly one type of justice judgment may be relevant.  \nGenerally, measuring organisational justice is not straightforward, but more clarity \nand differentiation in measurement promises significantly to improve conceptual clarity \nwithin organisational justice.   \n \nThe Social Context of Justice Perceptions \nA further area of current and future interest in organisational justice is the role of \nsocial context. Context has been relatively neglected in justice research, which may be partly \ndue to the paucity of justice research using qualitative methods. Contextual variables can be \nantecedents of justice perceptions, or they can moderate the perceptions of and reactions to \norganisational justice (Colquitt et al. 2005a). Context can include both sensitivity moderators \nand expectations moderators (Colquitt and Greenberg, 2003). The former make individuals \nmore sensitive to justice information or judgments, whilst the latter impact the \nconceptualisation of justice. These effects may take place at different stages: 1) between \nelements in the environment and the event appraisal of justice, 2) between the event justice \nand entity justice, 3) between event justice and reaction, and 4) between entity justice and \nreaction (Cropanzano et al. 2001a).  \n Research on three particular aspects of social context will be reviewed here: team \nenvironments, culture and power.  \nJustice in teams \n 29 \nJustice as a team-level phenomenon has been introduced by Mossholder, Bennett and \nMartin (1998). The average justice perceptions in teams were called climate level, and the \nwithin-group variance was introduced as climate strength. At the team level, the climate level \n(average procedural justice perceptions in a team) was found to be related to both team \nperformance and team absenteeism (Colquitt et al. 2002).  \nThe level of agreement on justice judgments within a team (justice climate strength) \nwas found to be an important moderator of climate level, such that the relationship between \nprocedural justice team perceptions and outcomes is more beneficial in stronger climates \n(Colquitt et al. 2002). Colquitt and colleagues identified team size and demography as \nantecedents of variance in teams (Colquitt et al. 2002). Also, Naumann and Bennett (2000) \nfound that perceived cohesion and supervisor visibility were associated with higher \nagreement on procedural justice. \n As with individual justice perceptions, team climates may relate to different foci. \nLiao and Rupp (2005) identified four forms of justice climate: organisation-focused \nprocedural and informational justice climate, and supervisor-focused procedural and \ninterpersonal justice climate (related to work outcomes). Furthermore, the team level \nexperience is likely to interact with different level experiences within an organisation, leading \nto a multi-level model of justice experiences and effects. First evidence for this was found in \na study on multi-level decision-making processes, where voice could be allowed both at the \nteam level and by organisational authorities (Price et al. 2006). People\u2019s reactions and \nfairness judgments were most beneficial when people were allowed voice in their team and \nthe team in turn was given voice by the organisational authorities. When voice broke down at \none of the two levels, reactions were not significantly different from a breakdown at both \nlevels. This study stresses the importance of investigating different levels of fair treatment \nsimultaneously, in order to be able to understand and predict responses.  \n 30 \n While these studies have demonstrated that team effects of justice are powerful \npredictors of reactions, so far we know little about how these team effects emerge, and why \nteam contexts are moderators of justice effects. Roberson (2006) investigated the emergence \nof justice climate from a sense-making perspective, and gathered conversational data from \nteams that were exposed to different levels of procedural and distributive fairness. While it \nwas predicted that teams that experience unfair procedural justice and unfavourable outcomes \nwould be more likely to engage in sense-making, and that their sense-making process would \nbe more elaborate, this was not the case. Contrary to the predictions, teams that experienced \nfair procedural justice treatment and unfavourable outcomes engaged in more sense-making \nthan teams in other conditions, which could be due to attribution processes that were at play. \nIncreased sense-making activity within the team (for example, discussing more and longer) \nincreased both procedural and distributive justice climate strength.  \nThe team context may also impact the choice of justice norms that individuals within \nthe team apply (Colquitt and Jackson 2006). The fairness criteria that have been found for \nindividuals, may become more or less important in team settings. In two scenario studies, \nColquitt and Jackson found that the in team contexts, equality, consistency and decision \ncontrol become more important rules. In addition, team size and composition mattered for the \nchoice of rules, such that the accuracy rule was more important in small teams, whereas the \nconsistency and bias suppression rules were more important in diverse teams. Future research \ncould also investigate whether fairness overall becomes more or less important in teams.  \n The team perspective points towards the important role that colleagues outside \nhierarchical reporting relationships can play for justice dynamics. Of particular interest in this \ncontext is recent research on the role of vicarious justice judgments. The field of \norganisational justice has so far concentrated mainly on perceptions regarding one\u2019s own \ntreatment. Most of the research on vicarious justice experiences has not been conducted in \n 31 \norganisational settings \u2013 examples are tests of the deontic theory of fairness (Folger 2001), \nresearch on the just world hypothesis (Lerner 1980), or research on the persistent injustice \neffect (Davidson and Friedman 1998). Yet first contributions in organisational contexts also \nindicate that the justice experiences and the justice judgments of one\u2019s peers do matter \n(Colquitt et al. 2002; Lamertz 2002). For example, research showed that a person\u2019s reaction \ncould be strongly influenced by social reports of others having received similar treatment \n(Van den Bos and Lind 2001). De Cremer and Van Hiel (2006) have found that the impact of \nothers\u2019 treatment on a person\u2019s reactions is moderated by helpful and supportive behaviour of \nthe person receiving fair or unfair treatment. Their findings, which are replicated in scenario, \nsurvey and laboratory studies, support a main effect for others\u2019 procedural justice on one\u2019s \nown feelings and actions. This includes interaction between others\u2019 procedural justice \ntreatment and others\u2019 concern for the actor on one\u2019s own emotions and behaviours. There was \nsome evidence for a mediating effect of emotions, but other mechanisms, such as reciprocity, \ncannot be excluded.  \n This area is bound to receive further research interest. Finding out about team level \njustice dynamics, and the role that the treatment of colleagues plays in the workplace, could \nhelp to refine our understanding of justice in the workplace. \n \nJustice and culture \nCulture is an important part of social context, and Greenberg (2001a) argued that \ncross-cultural research will help us to better understand organisational justice. The \ninvestigation of justice in different cultural settings has recognised that justice norms and \neven the importance of the concept of justice itself differ between cultures (Greenberg \n2001b). Culture may in particular impact upon the following: the rules for judging justice, the \ngoals of fair treatment, the choices made when applying principles, the process of forming \n 32 \njudgments, and the effects of justice on outcomes (Colquitt et al. 2005a). Previous research \nhas pointed out the different principles underlying employment, and how cultures differ along \ndimensions such as power distance, individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance and \nlong- or short-term orientation (Hofstede 1993). The dimensions of individualism and power \ndistance have been employed particularly often by justice researchers when trying to explain \ncross-cultural differences in justice judgments and effects. \n Justice researchers have found different justice rules or norms in different cultures \n(Greenberg 2001).  Cropanzano and Greenberg (1997) describe that some collectivistic \nsocieties seem to prefer equal allocations, and individualistic societies favour equity. \nHowever, in a society there may be more immediate situational demands depending on \ncontext. Societies, just like individuals, have goals that are salient at a time. Chen (1995) \nfound that North Americans, despite living in a more individualistic culture, were more likely \nto make equal allocations of rewards, whereas Chinese, despite their more collectivistic \nculture, were more likely to use the equity rule of allocation. This finding was explained by \nthe goals that were salient in those societies, such that whilst American organisations were \ntrying to become more humanistic, the Chinese were striving for improved profitability. \n McFarlin and Sweeney (2001) have investigated the role of cultural differences in \nthe context of procedural justice in performance evaluation. They found that the degree of \ncollectivism versus individualism, as well as the degree of formality, will strongly impact the \npreferred evaluation style in different cultures. Typically, more feminine cultures tended to \nhave informal performance evaluations, whereas masculine cultures preferred formal \nprocedures. In low power-distance cultures, a high degree of input was given, while high \npower distance cultures may be more comfortable with an autocratic evaluation. Some \ncultures prefer explicit feedback, whilst others choose only very subtle, nonverbal feedback. \n 33 \nThus, it may depend on the cultural context, whether certain procedures and types of \ninteraction are perceived as fair in performance evaluations. \n But cultures differ not only in their judgments of justice, but also in their reactions to \njustice. Blader, Chang and Tyler (2001) found that although procedural injustice prompted \nretaliation in both US and Taiwan, the Taiwanese were less likely to retaliate. Americans are \nmore likely to take action when interpersonal expectations are violated. Among Hong Kong \nChinese and American employees, power distance was found to moderate the effects of \ndistributive and procedural justice on absenteeism, job satisfaction and performance (Lam et \nal. 2002).  \n Kim and Leung found that even the relative impact of individual dimensions of \nfairness for overall fairness judgments differ between cultures (Kim and Leung 2007). In a \ncross-cultural study with samples in the US, China, Korea and Japan, they found that \ndistributive justice was related to overall fairness less strongly for the US and Japanese \nsamples than for Chinese and Korean samples. No country differences were found for the \nrelative importance of procedural justice (which has both relational and instrumental \nconnotations). Interactional justice was related more strongly to overall fairness for \nAmericans and Japanese than for Chinese and Koreans. These results can mostly be explained \nthrough materialism and power distance. \n Leung and Tong (2004) developed a three-stage model of justice rules, criteria and \npractices, to organise cultural differences. Justice rules are defined as abstract principles to \ndecide the fairness of decisions, while criteria are the specifications within rules, and \npractices are concrete behaviours and arrangements that operationalise justice criteria. For \nexample, equity may be used as a rule of distributive justice. Criteria within equity are the \ndifferent forms of input that count as important, such as loyalty, status, performance, or \n 34 \nfamily size. These criteria can be operationalised in various ways (justice practices): \nexamples include different indicators of performance, such as work output or effort. \n Recently, Leung (2005)  has reviewed and summarised research on justice across \ncultures within the three-stage framework developed by Leung and Tong (2004). Leung \nconcludes that substantial differences exist between cultures in their preferences for justice \nrules. Similarly, differences have been found for distributive, procedural and interactional \ncriteria of justice, although there is less research in this area and few criteria have been \ninvestigated. These include voice and inputs for equity. The differences in justice norms and \njustice criteria have been explained mainly in terms of individualism-collectivism, and power \ndistance. Finally, the evidence on different justice practices is very rare and scattered. Leung \npresents mostly speculative relationships: for example, collectivists should be more likely to \nprefer process control mechanisms that are group-based, while individualist cultures should \nprefer individual process control. However, it is the level of practices that may be particularly \ncrucial in understanding justice across cultures.  \n The fact that the large majority of justice research has been conducted in the US \n(Greenberg 2001a) means that it may not translate well into other cultures (McFarlin and \nSweeney 2001). Cross-cultural investigations promise further insights into the phenomenon \nof organisational justice, as well as into culture and the specific cultures under investigation, \nand will enable researchers to assess the generalisability of existing theories of justice \n(Greenberg 2001b), and to potentially develop better theories.  \nThe role of power \nPerceptions of justice and predominant justice norms may be co-determined by the \ndistribution of power. For example, Leventhal posits that when influential members are \ndissatisfied with distributions, then procedures may be questioned and thus become more \nsalient (Leventhal et al. 1980). In effect, this would mean that powerful members determine \n 35 \nwhich justice dimensions are more salient in an organisation. Greenberg and Cohen (1982)  \npropose that it may also depend on the relative power of organisational members, to which \nextent actual allocations or reallocations in a given situation are consistent with any justice \nnorm.  \nWe do not really know through which mechanisms the principles of justice that \nsupport the powerful come to be endorsed by the less powerful (Cohen and Greenberg 1982). \nOne mechanism could be through ideological discourse and framing. Watson states, \u201cresearch \non perceptions of fairness is complicated by the ways in which powerful alliances (e.g., \nchange agents) control and disseminate ideas, norms and values \u2013 ideology \u2013 that encourage \nothers to understand and interpret changes through management\u2019s preferred cognitive frame \nof reference\u201d (Watson 2003, 155). He investigated how ideological discourse by managers in \nchange situations attempts to construct impressions of fairness and legitimacy. Watson (2003) \nfound evidence that leaders use numerous strategies to influence employees\u2019 perceptions of \nfairness. For future research, it would be interesting to investigate recipient or audience \nreactions to ideological discourse: how far are employees really influenced, and does this \ntranslate into cooperation?  \nStructural conditions can be a further mechanism through which the powerful can \ninfluence justice judgments. Ambrose and Schminke (2003) found that under different \nstructural conditions, the relative effects of procedural and interactional justice were different. \nIn mechanistic organisations, procedural justice and perceived organisational support were \nstrongly linked, and in organic organisations, interactional justice and supervisory trust were \nmore strongly linked. The different organisational forms investigated in this study \n(mechanistic versus organic) also imply different power relationships. Investigating these \nlinks further could be a fruitful area of research. For example, future studies could include \nmeasures of span of control, leadership style, and dependency.  \n 36 \nOf course, the type of power strategy or power exercise may have an impact on the \nresulting justice mechanisms. A laboratory study by Molm, Quist and Wiseley (1993) \ncompared the use of power strategies that are based either on rewards or punishments. Over \ntime, the instrumental strategies of power tended to overcome reactions to injustice. Thus, \nparticipants complied with the power exercise. However, punishment power strategies were \nperceived as less fair than rewards, and were seen as more intentional. Both punishment and \nreward were seen as less fair than reciprocity.  \n The studies above suggest that power matters in relation to organisational justice, \nand that various areas remain to be investigated, such as ideological framing, structural \nelements and different styles of power exercise.  \n A recent conceptual paper by Fortin and Fellenz (2007) provides a first taxonomy of \ngrouping power effects within organisational justice. By applying Lukes\u2019 three-dimensional \nframework of power exercise (Lukes 1974, 2005), they identify three types of mechanisms \nmanagers may use to influence and manage the formation of fairness perceptions. The first \ncategory is called \u2018responding\u2019, and corresponds to the view implicitly taken by most justice \nresearchers to date. Fairness perceptions and consequent positive reactions are created by \norganisations through responding to set criteria of justice. The second category is called \n\u2018preventing\u2019, and is based on the idea that the less powerful may be prevented from raising \ntheir justice concerns or from reacting to justice concerns. The third category, \u2018shaping\u2019, \nconsiders the possibilities of shaping employees\u2019 conceptualizations of fairness; for example, \nthrough social construction of meaning, suggesting particular referent standards, and \nsocialisation. Thus, particular criteria of justice may be meaningless in any one context, and \nactions that are generally perceived as unjust may not lead to negative reactions in a specific \nsetting. This approach not only suggests new justice mechanisms with a view to power, but \n 37 \nalso raises new moral questions for justice researchers and managers. (See the following \nsection on justice and morality.) \nOverall, the way that justice judgments and reactions are influenced by power has \nreceived very little attention, yet this is likely to be an important area in order to understand \njustice mechanisms in real organisations.  \nResearch Recommendations:  \nWhile researchers have acknowledged the important role of social context, much \nresearch remains to be done in this area. \u201cOrganizational justice researchers recognize the \nimportant role organization context plays in justice perceptions, yet few studies \nsystematically examine contextual variables\u201d (Ambrose and Schminke 2003, 295). \nIf context really is an important determinant of justice perceptions and effects in real \nlife, then both justice theory and justice research need to integrate context variables in order \nto develop predictions and explanations that are valid in the field. Three areas of immediate \nrelevance to justice theory and research have been discussed: team contexts, culture and \npower. In order to investigate these phenomena further, a greater diversity of approaches may \nprove helpful. In particular, there is currently very little qualitative research addressing the \nimpact of social context on justice. For example, Greenberg recommended \u201cconducting \ndetailed ethnographic analyses aimed at determining precisely what constitutes justice in \nvarious cultures, including systematic field interviews and participant observation studies\u201c \n(Greenberg 2001b, 372). \n Different disciplinary foci may be of particular use here, too. The sociological \ntraditions of power research, for example, could be extended to organisational justice. New \ntheoretical developments are also needed to guide research in these areas. Current justice \ntheorizing (as described earlier) takes little notice of social context. One exception is the \n 38 \ngroup engagement model, but it is currently limited to identification processes. Current \ntheories might be extended to take other aspects of social context into account. \nJustice over Time \nEmployment relationships are not just the simple aggregate of individual interactions. \nTypically, organisational members actively make connections between different events and \nexperiences. Justice perceptions at any one time are related both to past experiences and \npresent circumstances, and are likely to impact upon expectations of future treatment. Yet \ntemporal effects remain under-researched in organisational justice. As Ambrose and \nCropanzano put it, \u201cDespite the abundance of research, longitudinal examinations of fairness \nare notably rare. As a result, scholars have a good snapshot of justice at any one instance but \nhave relatively less knowledge about the unfolding effects of justice and injustice over time.\u201d \n(Ambrose and Cropanzano 2003, 266). The lack of temporal consideration in organisational \njustice also limits the applicability for organisational justice theory in situations of change: \u201cIf \nchange is systematic, then any perspective on organizational justice that does not deal with \nchange is inherently limited\u201d (Cropanzano and Prehar 2001, 266). In the following, a few \ninitial developments that shed some light on temporal justice effects will be introduced, but \nthere is no well-developed stream of research in this area so far.  \nOne of the first contributions to highlight the important role of time for justice effects \nwas Folger\u2019s research on the \u201cfrustration effect\u201d (Folger 1977). Folger found that if people \nare given the opportunity to voice their opinion in decision-making contexts, they become \nfrustrated if this is repeatedly followed by unfair outcomes. Finally, they may react more \nnegatively to voice (being asked for their opinion) than to not being asked. Thus, some type \nof cumulative effect is overriding the famous \u201cvoice effect\u201d, which had been repeated so \noften in one-off encounters.  \n 39 \nMore evidence for cumulative effects of unjust events has been found by Gilliland and \ncolleagues. They found that, when judging an actor (entity), there is a threshold at which no \namount of just acts can compensate for unjust acts (Gilliland et al. 1998). Similarly, Taylor \n(2001) proposed that minor injustices build up over time, and that there is a \u201cthreshold effect\u201d \nassociated with them.  \nFurther, expectations appear to play a crucial role over time. Van den Bos and \ncolleagues found that expectations could also reverse the voice effect (Van den Bos et al. \n1996). People who do not expect voice at all, even react more negatively to voice than to no \nvoice. \n A number of contributions suggest that individuals may interpret their experience in \nthe light of previous fairness experiences. People who have experienced repeated injustices \nare, for example, less likely to accept explanations, and will perceive new acts as more injust \n(Davidson and Friedman, 1998). Davidson and Friedman have termed this phenomenon the \npersistent injustice effect (1998). Shapiro and Kirkman propose that perceived injustice may \nbe the result of expected or anticipated injustice (2001). In the context of self-managed work \nteams, they found some evidence for the effect that \u201canticipated\u201d injustice would increase the \nlikelihood of perceived injustice (Shapiro and Kirkman 1999).  \nOn the other hand, people may compare their experiences with expectations or with \nprevious experiences. Brockner and colleagues found that individuals \u201cwho have experienced \nhigh levels of the procedural elements in the past are likely to believe that high levels of those \nelements will and should be present in the focal situation.\u201d (Brockner et al. 2001, P 189). \nWhen studying the reactions of layoff survivors (Brockner et al. 1994), they found that \nsurvivors who had received advance notification and clear explanations in the past (elements \nof informational fairness) were more likely to be affected by the lack of these elements. \nSimilarly, research by Brockner and colleagues found that individuals who were highly \n 40 \ncommitted to their organisations may react more negatively to unfairness than less committed \nemployees (Brockner et al. 1992). \nClearly, there are two different and potentially contradictory explanations regarding \nthe effect that prior experiences and expectations can have on later justice experiences. On the \none hand, previously experienced injustice may heighten the likelihood or impact of \nconsequently perceived injustice (an assimilation effect), while on the other hand previously \nperceived justice is expected to heighten the likelihood or impact of consequently perceived \ninjustice (a constrast effect). This contradiction has already been pointed out by Tax and \ncolleagues, who investigated the role of prior customer service experiences on customers\u2019 \njustice judgments of,  and reactions to, complaint incidents  (Tax et al. 1998). These authors \nidentified the following competing predictions for the role of prior service experience before \na complaint incident: \n1) \u201cThe effect of dissatisfaction with complaint handling on trust and commitment will \nbecome smaller as the prior experience becomes more positive and approach zero \nwhen prior experience is highly positive\u201d (Tax et al.1998, 65) \n2) \u201cThe effect of dissatisfaction with complaint handling on trust and commitment will \nstart from zero and become larger as prior experiences become more positive\u201d (66). \n Tax and colleagues call this second effect the \u201cdouble deviation effect\u201d (65), where the \ninitial event sparks high expectations for recovery \u201cparticularly for loyal customers\u201d (66), \nand then leads to even stronger disappointement when the recovery attempt is also \nperceived as unjust. They found that \u201cprior positive experiences mitigate, to a limited \nextent, the effects of poor complaint handling\u201d(60). Thus, the first prediction was \nsupported, and more positive prior experience leads to less (not more) perceived injustice. It \nremains unclear whether under different boundary conditions the opposite effect may occur, \nand what these boundary conditions might be.  \n 41 \nRecently, Van den Bos and colleagues even found some evidence for both contrast \nand assimilation effects within one study (Van den Bos et al. 2005). It was found that the \nreaction of employees to fair experiences with a particular supervisor was more positive \ntoward subsequent neutral messages when they came from their old supervisor, than when \nthey came from a new supervisor. This assimilation effect was found to affect their \nsatisfaction with supervisor\u2019s communication and acceptance of the supervisor. On the other \nhand, a contrast effect was found in that participants reacted more positively to a neutral \ndemand from a new supervisor when they had earlier unfair experiences of a different \nsupervisor.  \nWe don\u2019t know when contrast and assimilation effects of justice occur, but clearly this \nis an important area for future research. Some of the extant theories of organisational justice \nmay be adapted to integrate past experience. Fairness theory for example (Folger and \nCropanzano 2001) suggests that past experiences may shape the available counterfactuals \n(\u201cwould\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d and \u201ccould\u201d) over time. Judgments of \u201cshould\u201d may be influenced \nthrough the legitimacy created through past experiences (Brockner et al. 2001).  This \ntheoretical perspective could explain contrast effects. \nFairness heuristics, on the other hand, suggest that a fairness judgment, once made, is \nlikely to last until very clear information to the contrary becomes available. Equally, the \ngroup engagement model proposes that fairness effects rely on identity processes, which are \nlikely to be relatively stable. This perspective might be better suited to explain assimilation \neffects. \nWe are currently lacking theoretical perspectives that focus explicitly on different \nprocesses over longer time spans. In particular, the course of repeated actions and reactions \nwithin relationships may lead to different temporal effects. Currently, justice theories are \nlooking at justice perceptions within a particular relationship (either employee-supervisor or \n 42 \nemployee-organisation), rather than looking at the overall relationship. A first attempt to \nrelate proactive justice considerations by the decision-maker with the reactive justice \njudgments of the receiver is the model by Greenberg and Wiethoff (2001). The six steps \noutlined in this model describe the processes by which justice judgments and efforts to \npromote justice are made in organisations. The model departs from the occurrence of an event \nthat demands a decision. The first step in the model is assessment. The inputs for this \nassessment are context cues, information cues and individual differences. The individual \nmakes a judgment of event fairness. Once this judgment is made, then in a second step the \nindividual reacts, taking into account eventual history of unjust treatment, the form of \ninjustice, use of justifications, opportunities for expression, etc. This reaction or response will \nlead to response feedback: the manager or decision maker recognises the employee behaviour \nif justice related attributions were triggered (e.g., if the behaviour is unusual). The fourth step \nnow depends on whether the manager or decision-maker wants to be fair or not. This step is \nentitled creation. It is the proactive creation of justice perceptions, and could include \ncompensation, justification or impression management. Having experienced the creation step \nand proactively having dealt with justice issues, the manager may now incorporate justice \nconsiderations into further related aspects, enacting justice in both procedures and policies \n(enactment - step five). In a final step, feedback, justice may be incorporated in daily \ncompany routine and policies (step six). In practice, the steps might not occur exactly in the \norder proposed, and the process is likely to be complicated by numerous additional factors. \nHowever, the model by Greenberg and Wiethoff presents a first attempt to integrate a longer \ntemporal perspective into justice theory. This model proposes that previous perceptions of \njustice act as a moderator of the link between fairness perceptions and reactions to the \nfairness, in the focal situation. Assimilation and contrast effects could similarly be interpreted \n 43 \nas the consequence of an interaction effect between present experience and previous justice \nperceptions.  \nA particularly interesting empirical contribution to the links between reactive and \nproactive justice has been a recent article on antecedents and outcomes of fairness (Aryee et \nal. 2007). In a Chinese telecommunication company, Aryee and colleagues found that the \nperceived interactional fairness of a supervisor (i.e., how they are treated by their manager) is \nrelated to the interactional fairness of their subordinates. \u201cSupervisors who experience \ninteractional injustice at the hands of their immediate bosses may take out their frustration on \nsubordinates\u201d (Aryee et al. 2007, 192). This is one of the first studies to suggest that injustice \nmay trickle down an organisation, and as such has a bearing both on justice mechanisms over \ntime and on the role of power for justice (see above).  The nature of hierarchical and vertical \nrelationships, and justice judgments are likely to be intertwined in a complex way over time.  \nResearch Recommendations \nThe field of organisational justice can benefit substantially from integrating aspects \nof time. This will require both theory development as well as targeted empirical research. In \nparticular, entitlements and psychological contracts may be useful concepts to help integrate \neffects over time into justice theory. Once people believe that they are entitled to a certain \nbenefit or treatment in their psychological contract, they are likely to react negatively when \ntheir employer does not meet their expectations (Heath et al. 1993). The importance of justice \ndynamics in changing employment relationships has been exemplified by research in the \ncontext of changed employment contracts (Saunders and Thornhill 2006). The dynamic \nconstruct of psychological contracts has been employed to describe the perceptions of \nobligations and expectations of both parties in changed and changing employment \nrelationships (Guest 2004). Drawing on the framework of psychological contracts could bring \na more dynamic perspective to fairness perceptions (Cropanzano and Prehar 2001).  \n 44 \nFuture research with more than two data points is necessary to gain insights into \nwhen and how people revise their judgments of justice and to find out about trajectories of \njustice perceptions. In particular, we do not know under what circumstances contrast versus \nassimilation effects hold, and what are the contingency factors and moderators of the stability \nof fairness perceptions. The strength of justice attitudes may be one such moderator \n(Krosnick et al. 1993). Apart from longitudinal studies, more controlled investigations (e.g., \nexperiments or scenario studies) may be helpful in advancing knowledge in this area of \nmechanisms of contrast and assimilation effects of organisational fairness perceptions.  \nIt has also been found that social processes and power distributions are likely to exert \nan impact on fairness dynamics over time. This area is under-researched. Tools from \nsociological studies, such as socialization and structural approaches, may be an interesting \nroute for future research, and would also remedy the field\u2019s present lack of cross-fertilization \nfrom other disciplines.  \n \nJustice and Morality \nWhile the roots of justice lie in the field of morality and ethics, it is only recently \nthat the overlap between organisational justice and morality has received increased attention. \nVirtually any situation that can be analysed through an organisational justice lens could also \nbe analysed in moral terms. However, morality and justice are not the same (Folger et al. \n2005). Moral does not necessarily mean fair, as fairness is only one of many moral principles, \nand the concrete standard of morality will depend on the moral framework applied (Fortin \nand Fellenz 2007). Similarly, fair does not always mean moral, as some cases of unfairness \nmay be less serious than what is typically called an immoral action, and unfairness may \nhappen without fault of the actor (e.g., an accident can cause an unfair outcome) (Folger et al. \n2005).  \n 45 \nIn their recent review, Folger and colleages concentrated on the deontic model of \njustice and its links to fairness theory (Folger et al. 2005). The deontic model of justice points \nout the importance of moral principles as antecedents of justice reactions, and fairness theory \n(see above) describes how people react to moral transgressions and assign blame to \nperpretators. While this is an important link between morality and justice, we can look at a \nmuch wider scope of linkages at different levels of analysis. At an individual level, the \nweighting of justice dimensions implies a value rational choice: An individual actor needs to \nchoose between normative standards when reacting to fair or unfair treatment, or when \nmaking fair or unfair decisions. On a larger level of analysis, the treatment of particular \ngroups and of disadvantaged groups is often discussed in moral terms, but seldom the focus \nof organisational justice research. We may see more of this in the future. Finally, there is the \nmeta-level of the relationship between organisational justice as a field and as a research \ncommunity, and morality or ethics. Relatively little research deals with the actual moral \nimpact of organisational justice research in society. In the following discussion, contributions \nfor these three levels will be reviewed: Individual morality and its relationship with just \nactions and justice perceptions, the just treatment of particular demographic groups, and the \nmoral and ethical implications of organisational justice research.  \nIndividual morality and its relationship with just actions and justice perceptions \nOver recent years, a few authors have investigated the link between individual \nmorality and justice preferences. For example, Ambrose and Schminke drew on Kohlberg\u2019s \nmodel of moral development (Kohlberg 1984) and investigated whether the relative \nimportance of different justice dimensions depended on the perceiver\u2019s cognitive and moral \ndevelopment (Ambrose and Schminke 2001; Schminke and Ambrose 1997). According to \nKohlberg\u2019s model, pre-conventional and conventional levels of cognitive moral development \nreflect ethical reasoning based on outcomes, whereas the post-conventional level reflects \n 46 \nreasoning based on rules, principles and procedures. Thus, for adults who are operating at the \nconventional ethicality level (and according to research, most adults do), focusing on ethics is \nfocusing mostly on outcome ethicality. In line with this reasoning, Ambrose and Schminke \nfound that distributive fairness was the most important dimension for participants high on \nutilitarianism. On the other hand, employees who were high on formalism (who reflected \npost-conventional ethical reasoning) seemed to focus more on  the procedural justice rules of \nethicality. Thus, educating adults to reach formalist levels of ethical development would \nprobably lead to an increased focus on procedures and less focus on distributive justice.  \nPatient and Skarlicki (2007) also found that people at higher levels of moral development \nwere interpersonally more just than participants with lower levels of moral development in \ncommunicating bad news, when asked to empathise with the recipient of negative bad news. \nThus, people at higher levels of moral development may be better able to translate the moral \nimperative of empathy into actions. This study is an important extension of moral \ndevelopment issues into the domain of proactive justice. \nTrait morality may also be an important moderator of justice effects for recipients of \nfairness decisions (Colquitt et al. 2006). A laboratory study by Colquitt and colleagues \nsupported that trait morality was one of the moderators of justice effects on task performance \nand counterproductive behaviour. This finding is in line with fairness theory, which holds that \nindividuals\u2019 reactions to injustice represent reactions to moral transgressions. Individuals who \nare high in trait morality may be more sensitive to particular types of transgressions than \nothers. However, the morality measure used in this case was the intersection of high \nagreeableness and high conscientiousness (from the Personality Item Pool 2001), and may not \ncorrespond to other conceptions of morality. Colquitt and colleagues propose that further \nresearch may use the Defining Issues Test 2 (Rest et al. 1999).  \n 47 \nThe work by Skitka and colleagues is another attempt to link individual morality and \njustice judgments. In the value protection of justice model (Skitka and Mullen 2002), personal \nidentity concerns are an important antecedent to justice motives and judgments (while most at \nthe literature looks at social identity reasons). Skitka and Mullen argue that moral positions or \nstands (moral mandates) are important determinants of how people think about fairness. Both \nin a real life case (Elian Gonzalez case, Skitka and Mullen 2002) and with regards to a \nnumber of political issues (Skitka 2002), the model was supported. Skitka found that having a \nmoral mandate on abortion, civil rights or immigration was not linked to procedural justice \njudgments of the political institutions concerned with these topics, as long as those \ninstitutions posed no concrete moral value threat to these concerns. However, when a possible \nthreat was posed to the perceiver\u2019s moral mandate, this moral mandate predicated procedural \nand distributive justice, as well as decision acceptance and moral outrage. Thus, our moral \nconvictions may only become important determinants of justice judgments when a threat is \nposed to these moral convictions.  \nOther variables appear to be closely linked to individual morality and justice. For \nexample, Lerner introduced the \u201cbelief in a just world\u201d as a personal characteristic (Lerner \n1980; 1981). According to Lerner, people need to believe that the world is a place where one \ngenerally gets what one deserves (Lerner and Miller 1978). Individuals may differ in how \nstrongly they hold this belief. In a just world, people like to think that everyone deserves what \nthey get. Lerner researched reactions to individuals suffering (through no apparent fault of \ntheir own) and showed that a high belief in a just world can be related to people blaming \ninnocent victims in some cases (especially when the suffering could not be relieved).  \nSimilarly, justice sensitivity appears to have moral implications. Justice sensitivity \nwas first introduced as an individual difference in reactions to unfair situations by Schmitt, \nNeumann and Montada (1995). Three dimensions have been differentiated: sensitivity \n 48 \ntowards experienced injustice towards self (justice sensitivity as victim), towards observing \nothers being treated unfairly (justice sensitivity as observer), and towards profiting from \nunfair events (justice sensitivity as perpetrator). Schmitt found that high values of justice \nsensitivity as victim predicted a low willingness of West German respondents to transfer \nmoney to the economically weaker East of Germany. Justice sensitivity as perpetrator and \nobserver, on the other hand, predicted more positive attitudes towards helping (Schmitt 1998).  \nIn line with this finding, Fletchenhauer and Huang (2004) found that participants in \nultimatum and dictator games were more likely to follow equality norms (sharing with their \npeers) when they were high on justice sensitivity as observer and perpetrator, but the contrary \nwas true for people high on sensitivity as victim.  \n\u201cPeople with a high value of JS (justice sensitivity) victim appear to be rather \nstrategic in their concern for justice and fairness. They protest against unfair situations \nwhen they themselves are the victims, but it seems that they are not willing to forego \nmonetary rewards for the sake of preventing such unfair situations. Furthermore, a \nhigh level of JS (justice sensitivity) victim is related to a high willingness to exploit \nothers if this seems useful and to rather ignoring unfair treatment of others\u201d \n(Fletchenhauer and Huang 2004, 1025).  \nMaera (2001) suggested that virtue ethics could provide new perspectives for organisational \njustice research, and that virtue ethics could propose different character traits that are likely to \ngo together with justice. Future research on different character traits may help to shed further \nlight on both reactive and proactive justice reasons and dynamics. \nThe (in-)justice experience of demographic groups and different stakeholders \nOn a larger scale, justice issues arise with respect to particular groups of people.  \nA few years have passed since Maera reminded justice researchers that their research and \ntheory should not forget less powerful groups: \u201cWe cannot forget, however, either in research \n 49 \nor practice that the view of the least powerful may in the end be the most important view in \nbuilding just organizations and in doing research about how to build them. Those who do not \nhave the power to distribute the burdens and benefits, and have probably had to bear more of \nthe former and have enjoyed less of the latter, should never be far from our theorizing, \nempirical inquiry, or practice\u201d (Meara 2001, 233). Yet still, there is surprisingly little research \ncombining organisational justice and the (un-)fair treatment of disadvantaged groups.  \nTwo of the rare empirical investigations in this area will be highlighted here: \nJasso and Webster Jr. (1997) investigated fairness judgments and the gender wage gap  \nthrough analysing data from 1974. They found that both female and male respondents used \nmultiple standards to determine just pay for female versus male single workers. Both groups \nfound a gender wage gap fair (on average women earning 15% less). This gap was smaller \nwhen women assigned a \u201cfair\u201d wage than when men decided. However, the male observers \nassigned higher earnings for both women and men overall. Future research should investigate \nwhether the wage gap perceptions have changed since this data was collected, and what the \nprocesses are that underlie such wage gaps. Jasso and Webster propose that participants might \neither apply different base rates to males versus females, or they may evaluate years of \nschooling as deserving different rates of return for males versus females. Uncovering the \nmechanisms that underlie such different judgments may also inform education and policy in \nan attempt to further the causes of equality. \nApart from gender, race discrimination appears to be another field where justice \njudgments are highly relevant. Cropanzano and colleagues for example investigated the \nfairness perceptions of black respondents with regards to different types of affirmative action \nprogrammes (AAPs) (Cropanzano et al. 2005b). Overall, \u2018race-conscious\u2019 AAPs evoked \nmore negative organisational justice perceptions than \u2018race-blind\u2019 AAPs. Distributive, \nprocedural and interactional justice perceptions interacted to affect organisational \n 50 \nattractiveness and intentions to apply. Future research in this area may, in particular, \ninvestigate the justice rules or norms or standards used by different groups, in order to \nunderstand better what fairness actually means for people in this context.  \nGenerally, justice concerns could be extended to a wider community of stakeholders \nof organisations.  In a conceptual paper, Hosmer and Kiewitz (2005) recently called for a \ncloser integration of business ethics and organisational justice through considering the fair \ntreatment of all stakeholders, not just the employees of a firm. The authors propose that \nethical decision making and actions of a firm will have an impact on productivitiy. Thus, \nobjective fairness determinants (from the side of the manager) can be related to subjective \nfairness perceptions and, consequently, to reactions. \u201cIn short, the authors propose a \nnormative stakehoder theory of the firm, based upon ethical principles that will have testable \ndescriptive hypotheses derived from the behavioural constructs\u201d (Hosmer and Kiewitz 2005, \n67). Research linking normative ethical concerns of different groups and subjective justice \nperceptions of the members of these groups may open up new views on justice in larger \ncontexts and in society. \n \nReflections on the impact of justice research  \nJustice researchers have reflected little on the ethical role of the field as a whole. More \nreflection in justice research, and more attention to the actual impact of justice research, could \nhelp the field to realise its potential for positive societal change.  \n Shapiro, for example, criticized the field for focusing on questions that are of \nimmediate value to managers, rather than attending to the needs of the victims of injustice \n(Shapiro 2001). She holds that the field should look towards helping to manage injustice \nfeelings, to deliver bad news and generally to create a more just world and workplace.  \n 51 \nReb and colleagues, for example, have recently conducted an investigation into how to \nremedy different types of injustices (Reb et al. 2006).  They found both in the field and \nexperiment that, in accordance with the multiple needs framework of organisational justice \n(Cropanzano et al. 2001a), participants preferred instrumental remedies (e.g., monetary \ncompensation) for procedural injustice and punitive remedies (disciplinary action) for \ninteractional injustice. The taxonomy developed by Reb and colleagues includes remedies for \nthe violation of control needs, meaning and virtue needs, and belonging or interpersonal \nneeds. This line of research certainly addresses problems both of injustice victims and of \norganisations. However, it still remains to be seen how managers will apply this type of \nfinding in practice.  \nIndeed, up to now, we do not really know how managers apply justice findings in \norganisations. Bies and Tripp warned that justice findings might even be used to perpetuate \ninjustice in the workplace  (Bies and Tripp 1995; 2001). MacCoun (2005) points out that \nknowledge about the \u201cfair process effect\u201d (giving people voice improves their acceptance of \noutcomes) may enable decision-makers to improve fairness perceptions without any costly \noutcome concessions. Thus, the desire for fairness can make employees vulnerable to \nexploitation. This danger has also been highlighted by Fortin and Fellenz (2007), who \ndescribe two \u201chypocrisies of fairness\u201d. First, managers may apply justice knowledge in an \ninstrumental way, and increase subjective justice perceptions without regard for moral justice. \nSecond, justice researchers may claim to promote fairness while not being concerned with the \nactual moral impact of the knowledge that they provide for managers.  \nDoes justice research help to promote values and change? Simply communicating \nfairness research findings to managers may not actually lead to increased fairness for \nemployees. Future research in organisational justice will need to reflect on its role and impact \nin society, something also recently endorsed by Hosmer and Kiewitz  (2005). It remains to be \n 52 \nseen whether findings from the field of organisational justice are used by managers for \nwindow dressing and impression management purposes, or whether they will benefit all \nstakeholders involved. Justice researchers could try to take an active role in promoting their \nfindings for use for maximum societal benefit. \nRecommendations for research  \nThe previous sections have examined the links between morality and justice research \nat different levels. More research on individual level morality may further our insights into \nmechanisms of promoting and reacting to justice. Virtue ethics could be a particularly fruitful \narea to be combined with organisational justice in this respect.  \nFurther, justice researchers should conduct more studies regarding the fair treatment of \nparticular demographic groups, investigating for example discrimination, affirmative action \nand sexual harassment. This could lead justice research to making new societal contributions \nand could give the field new levels of meaning and relevance. Similarly, different \nstakeholders in organisations should be considered, not just the employees. Drawing on \nadditional disciplines (e.g., sociology and ethics) and employing mixed methods may help to \nbring this important research agenda forward. In particular, qualitative studies are needed to \ncomplement the largely quantitatively dominated field of justice: \u201cJustice, as played out in \nlife, has a complexity and dynamism that is difficult to simulate in the laboratory or to capture \nwith traditional quantitative methodologies\u201d (Taylor 2001, 250) This data could validate, \nchallenge or explain findings in quantitative studies, as well as provide additional insight and \nmake sure the field does not become separated from the actual experience of organisational \n(in-)justice among individuals and groups.  \nFinally, organisational justice as a field would benefit from more reflection on and \nresearch into the actual application of its findings. This should not be done as a navel-gazing \nexercise, but should focus the view of the field more towards the outside world and towards \n 53 \njustice experiences of individuals and groups.  This reflection may also include the realisation \nthat fairness perceptions are simply not always the issue that is most important: \u201cIn many \nsituations, most individuals probably give little thought to questions of fairness\u201d (Leventhal \n1980, 47). \nConclusions \nOrganisational justice is one of the most popular and promising fields in \norganisational behaviour.  The explanatory power of the justice framework has been shown in \nnumerous contexts, and fairness helps to explain a host of reactions that are of interest for \norganisations.  \nThis review has focused on four areas that may move the organisational justice \nagenda forward: concept clarification, social context integration, time and links with morality. \nThese areas have received increased attention lately, but there are still relatively few \nempirical studies and theoretical frameworks that grapple with these issues.  \nConceptual clarity is vital for improved consistency of the field, and internal validity \nof studies. Through separating justice concerns from outcome concerns, and understanding \ndifferent types of justice judgments more clearly, empirical investigations can be more \ntargeted and will further new theory development. Concise measurement is a particularly \nimportant area in this respect. Measuring both outcome favourability and distributive justice \nin the same studies will help us to better understand the effects of, and interaction between, \nthe two concepts. Measures that clearly indicate the source of justice (e.g., supervisor or \norganisation) can further increase clarity. Future research will also need to investigate \nwhether the justice concept should usefully be extended to justice received from co-workers. \nFurthermore, studies that include both event and entity measures could improve our \nunderstanding of justice judgments.  \n 54 \nSituating organisational justice in social contexts and in time will be crucial to \nimprove the useability of organisational justice findings in organisations, and to improve \nexternal validity. Current developments such as studying justice in teams, vicarious justice \nperceptions, and justice in different cultures have already improved our knowledge of justice \nin real world contexts. It is proposed that future research should also pay more attention to \npower mechanisms and their interrelation with justice. Different disciplinary foci may be \nneeded to gain new perspectives. For example, tools from sociological studies could be \nparticularly useful. Generally, more longitudinal, qualitative and interdisciplinary research is \nexpected to generate new insights in this area. New theoretical developments are also \nnecessary to guide justice research that can integrate social context and time. This may \ninclude drawing on concepts from other areas of study, such as entitlements and \npsychological contracts. \n Finally, this paper proposes a multi-level view of the intersection of justice and \nmorality. Understanding the links between morality and justice at an individual, and \norganisational and societal level is necessary if justice researchers want to live up to the \npromise of their field for society. Bridging research in business ethics and organisational \njustice, as well as more critical self-reflection, are steps towards this goal. More research on \nindividual level morality may, for example, focus on mechanisms of promoting justice, and \ncould draw on virtue ethics. Employees are not the only stakeholders in organisations, and \norganisational justice research could usefully be extended to other groups. The literatures on \nthe unfair treatment of particular demographic groups have so far not received much attention \nin organisational justice. Finally, critical reflection on the application of justice research and \non the role of justice research should go hand in hand with critical research on the actual \nconsequences of applying justice research in organisations.  \n 55 \n I believe that the areas presented will be crucial for the future of \norganisational justice. Overall, there are more exciting research areas in organisational justice \nthan ever before. The field may be ready for new approaches and for more responsibility.   \n 56 \nReferences \nAdams, J.
