INTRODUCTION\nDiamond is a unique material combining a number of\nextreme intrinsic properties, which make it an interesting de-\nvice material for radiation detection, ranging from ultraviolet\nand x-ray detection to \u0001-, \u0002-, \u0003-particle and neutron\nmonitoring.1,2 The wide band gap of 5.5 eV means that an\nideal diamond is solar blind and has an extremely low num-\nber of free charge carriers excited thermally from the valence\nband into the conduction band, which translates into very\nlow detector leakage currents.3 The material\u2019s radiation hard-\nness and its chemical inertness are beneficial for long term\noperation in harsh environments either in terms of strong\nradiation fields4 or in aggressive ambient conditions. For ex-\nample, no significant changes in the signal amplitude due to\nradiation damage by high energy protons in polycrystalline\ndiamond have been found for doses up to 1015 protons\ncm\u22122.\n5\nThe low atomic number of carbon is considered as tissue\nequivalent and has triggered a long history of research in\ndiamond-based dosimetry.6 The large charge carrier mobili-\nties and saturation velocities will allow very fast signal cur-\nrent pulses. The charge transport properties crucially deter-\nmine the signal amplitude and reproducibility, thus the\nperformance of the detector. Consequently the performance\nvaries significantly with the defect distribution within the\nmaterial and polarization and priming phenomena are fre-\nquently observed in natural and synthetic diamonds.2,7\nSynthetic diamond has been purely polycrystalline ma-\nterial for many years and its spectroscopic application has\nbeen limited by strong charge carrier trapping at the defect\nrich grain boundaries.8,9 On the other hand, the defects intro-\nduced during the synthesis of natural gem stones cannot be\ncontrolled at all and only a very small percentage of selected\nnatural diamonds are suitable for detector applications.2 Al-\nthough the high temperature\/high pressure \u0001HTHP\u0002 produc-\ntion of single crystal diamond is possible, its drawbacks are\nthe extreme synthesis conditions as well as the difficulty to\nscale the process to larger areas.10 Additionally, it is often\nhard to achieve the purity required for electronic applica-\ntions, including radiation detection. In recent years, very\npromising high purity synthetic single crystal diamonds of\nmore than 100 \u0004m thickness grown by microwave plasma\nchemical vapor deposition \u0001CVD\u0002 have become\navailable.11\u201313 They offer the opportunity to study the charge\ntransport of this engineered material independent of grain\nboundaries.\nIon beam induced charge \u0001IBIC\u0002 imaging is a useful tool\nto image the spatial variations in charge transport and has\nbeen applied in numerous studies of diamond detector\nperformance.14\u201316\nIn this work, we have evaluated the charge transport\nthrough a piece of synthetic CVD single crystal diamond\nusing 5.48 MeV \u0001-particle induced charge transient pulses\nbetween 200 and 300 K at applied field strength between 300\nand 4000 V cm\u22121. The temperature dependence of the tran-\nsient charge pulses establishes the presence of a shallow hole\ntrap level previously reported in the literature.17,18 IBIC im-\naging with 2.6 MeV protons has been performed at 296 and\n270 K. Detector areas of reduced charge carrier velocities\ndue to polarization effects are distinguished in these images\nfrom areas of delayed charge transport due to the re-emission\nof charge carriers out of the aforementioned shallow hole\ntraps.a\u0002Electronic mail: a.lohstroh@surrey.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 101, 063711 \u00012007\u0002\n0021-8979\/2007\/101\u00026\u0001\/063711\/7\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics101, 063711-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

SIGNAL ANALYSIS\nIonizing radiation interacting with the material of a\nsemiconductor device will excite electrons from the valence\nband into the conduction band, which drift with a velocity\nv=\u0004E according to the electric field E throughout the detec-\ntor and their mobility \u0004, thereby inducing a current in the\noutside circuit. The number of created free charge carriers Q0\nis proportional to the energy absorbed by the detector. The\nintegrated current, i.e., the charge signal, is proportional to\nthe drift length of the carriers. In the special case of a detec-\ntor with a sandwich electrode structure with an electrode\ndistance d and charge carrier creation at a depth x close to\none electrode \u0001x\u0005d\u0002, mainly one charge carrier type \u0001either\nelectrons or holes\u0002 will contribute to the signal. If the electric\nfield throughout the detector is constant and no re-emission\nof charge carriers out of shallow trap levels occurs, then the\ncurrent pulse I\u0001t\u0002 starts when the radiation interaction takes\nplace at t=0. The current drops exponentially with a time\nconstant given by the carrier lifetime \u0006 until the carriers\nreach the opposite electrode after the transit time TR as given\nin Eq. \u00011\u0002.\nI\u0001t\u0002 \u0005 exp\u0006\u2212 t\n\u0006\n\u0007\n\u21d2 Q\u0001t\u0002 = \b\n0\nt\nI\u0001t\u0001\u0002dt\u0001 =\n\u0006\nTR\nd \u2212 x\nd \t1 \u2212 exp\u0006\n\u2212\nt\n\u0006\n\u0007\n for t\u0007 TR. \u00011\u0002\nReported charge carrier mobilities in diamond are larger\nthan 1000 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121.3,19,20 Assuming a typical device with\na maximum thickness d of 0.5 mm and an electric field\nstrength of more than 1 kV cm\u22121, it follows that the transit\ntime can be expected to be less than 50 ns.\nThe ratio of the total induced charge Qind \u0003where Qind\n=Q\u0001t\u2192\b\u0002, i.e., the time integrated current signal\u0004 over the\ncreated charge is defined as the charge collection efficiency\n\u0001CCE\u0002, which is given by the Hecht equation \u00012\u0002,21\nQind\nQ0\n= CCE =\n\u0004\u0006E\nd \t1 \u2212 exp\u0006 x \u2212 d\u0004\u0006E \u0007\n . \u00012\u0002\nThe trapping of drifting charge carriers at deep defect\nlevels causes the buildup of an internal space charge inside\nthe material of the device.22,23 Subsequently created electron\nhole pairs will experience a weakened electric field, which\ncauses a reduction in velocity and consequently in CCE. This\nprocess is referred to as polarization. On the other hand,\npriming, sometimes also called pumping, describes the in-\ncrease in charge carrier lifetime due to the filling of defect\nlevels with trapped charge carriers. Priming with electron, x-\nor \u0003-ray pre-irradiation can be used to improve detector\nperformance.24\nDelayed hole transport in diamond at t\tTR has been\nobserved in primed and unprimed, single and polycrystalline\ndiamond detectors, which is caused by the re-emission of\nholes out of a shallow trap with detrapping time constants \u0006D\nin the order of a few microseconds, clearly longer than TR.\nThey contribute to the charge signal, causing a \u201cslow\u201d com-\nponent visible in the integrated signal current pulse, as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 1.17,18 If charge carriers are only trapped once\nin a shallow trap during their transit, then the time constant\nof the slow component will be independent of the electric\nfield and the amplitude Q\u0001t\u0002 of the integrated current pulse\ncan be described by Eq. \u00013\u0002 for t\tTR, where Qslow and Qfast\nare the amplitude of the slow and fast component, respec-\ntively, so that Qind=Qfast+Qslow.\nQ\u0001t\u0002 = Qfast + Qslow\t1 \u2212 exp\u0006\u2212 t\n\u0006D\n\u0007\n . \u00013\u0002\nThe detrapping time constant \u0006D can be extracted from Eq.\n\u00014\u0002 using a standard linear regression, as demonstrated by\nBalducci et al.25\nln\u0003Qind \u2212 Q\u0001t\u0002\u0004 = ln Qslow \u2212\nt\n\u0006D\n. \u00014\u0002\nFor a purely thermally activated detrapping process, the\nrelationship between \u0006D and the temperature T is given by\nEq. \u00015\u0002 which is dominated by the activation energy EA; c is\na trap specific constant.26\n\u0006D = cT2 exp\u0006\u2212 EAkBT\u0007 . \u00015\u0002\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nThe sample studied in this work has been grown by\nCVD on a single crystalline HPHT synthesized diamond sub-\nstrate by Element Six Ltd. The growth process is similar to\nthe one described by Isberg et al.11 Additional nitrogen has\nbeen deliberately introduced into the growth reactor at sev-\neral stages of the growth process, which results in thin nitro-\ngen rich layers at varying distances from the substrate mate-\nrial. The sample has been cut vertically to the growth\ndirection, with dimensions of 2.5\n2.9\n0.49 mm3. Prior to\nthe contacting, a DiamondView image, was acquired using\nan instrument made by the Diamond Trading Company\nLtd.27 The instrument uses the short wave \u0001\u0007227 nm wave-\nlength\u0002 ultraviolet emission from xenon lamps to excite near\nsurface luminescence from diamond samples.

The signal has been passed on to an Ortec 570\nshaping amplifier followed by a multichannel analyzer for\nthe pulse height spectra acquisition. The amplitudes have\nbeen calibrated in terms of CCE using a pulser, cross corre-\nlated with a 100% efficient silicon pin diode, assuming the\naverage energy needed to create an electron hole pair of 3.6\nand 13.2 eV in silicon21 and diamond,30 respectively. The\nranges x of the 5.48 MeV \u0001-particles and 2.6 MeV protons\nare 15 and 35 \u0004m, respectively, as calculated by SRIM.31 This\nis small compared to the sample thickness d=490 \u0004m.\nTherefore, the charge induced under negative bias is mainly\ndue to electron drift, whereas charge induced under positive\nbias is sensitive to hole transport.\nTransient charge pulses have been acquired using a digi-\ntal oscilloscope with a maximum sampling rate of 2.5 Gs\/s\nin combination with the non-collimated \u0001-particle source, as\ndescribed by Wang et al.32 The time resolution of that system\nis limited by the system time response function dominated by\nthe preamplifier rise time and results in \u000550 ns. The time\nresolved ion beam imaging was performed by the digital\nIBIC setup described by Sellin et al.33 The minimum rise\ntime of that setup was about 80 ns during these experiments.\nIV. \u0001-PARTICLE SPECTROSCOPY\nFigure 2 shows the luminescence image of the sample.\nThe bright area at the bottom is the HPHT substrate material.\nThe horizontal luminescent lines are the introduced nitrogen\nrich layers. A cathodoluminescence experiment34 has shown\nthat these nitrogen rich layers emit a signal with a zero pho-\nnon line at 2.15 eV, originating from a neutral nitrogen va-\ncancy complex.35 Additionally, vertical line structures with\nenhanced blue band A luminescence are also distinguishable.\nThey are probably caused by dislocations or dislocation\nbundles.36\nWe acquired \u0001-particle induced charge amplitude spectra\nand rise time distributions as a function of bias voltage be-\ntween 200 and 300 K, some examples are displayed in Fig.\n3. The induced amplitudes did not change significantly with\ntemperature. Electron sensitive CCE distributions show well\nresolved peaks, as displayed in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002. In contrast, the hole\nsensitive data reflect poor hole transport. The hole spectra\nwere very sensitive to polarization effects and improved after\nirradiation at negative bias voltage due to the buildup of an\ninternal electric field, which is illustrated by the two graphs\nin Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002.\nWe have acquired the 10%\u201390% rise time \u000610%\u201390% un-\nder decreasing negative bias from \u2212100 to \u221215 V between\n200 and 300 K. The observed \u000610%\u201390% increased from\n50 to 70 ns as a function of bias voltage. Due to the intrinsic\nrise time of the system of 50 ns, the combination of \u000610%\u201390%\nand CCE data allows only a rough estimate of the lifetime\nusing Eq. \u00011\u0002, which is in the order of 15\u201330 ns. Assuming\ntypical mobility values reported in the recent literature of\nmore than 1000 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121,3,19,20 it is expected that the tran-\nsit time TR will be shorter than the time resolution of our\nsystem at bias voltages larger than \u00b150 V for both electrons\nand holes, which is in agreement with our observation.\nThe lower amplitudes of the hole signals under the low\nintensity \u0001-particle irradiation made a similar analysis of the\nhole transit time impossible. Nevertheless, a small percent-\nage of the hole pulses acquired between +100 and +200 V\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Photoluminescence image \u0001Courtesy of Element Six\nLtd.\u0002.\nFIG. 3.

We have fitted a detrapping time to each\npulse exhibiting a slow component using Eq. \u00014\u0002. The data\nfor the fit have been averaged over five consecutive sample\npoints to reduce the noise in the wave form. Only pulses with\na sufficiently large Qslow \u0001\t2.6% CCE\u0002 have been consid-\nered to reduce the influence of misleading fits of wave forms,\nwhich actually do not have a slow component. The fit inter-\nval begins at t=60 ns and was limited to the first 33% of the\nrising pulse length, because the impact of noise frequently\ndistorts the fit result when Q\u0001t\u0002 approaches Qind. Finally, fits\nwhich described the data very poorly \u0001r2\u00070.4\u0002 were re-\njected. Figure 4\u0001b\u0002 illustrates the procedure by showing the\nfit to the slow pulse shown in the Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002.\nThe pulse by pulse fitting of pulses results in distribu-\ntions of detrapping times extracted from pulses exhibiting a\nslow component acquired at the same temperature and volt-\nage setting, as exemplified in the inset of Fig. 5. These dis-\ntributions have resolvable peaks between 240 and 296 K,\nand the peak positions were used to produce an Arrhenius\nplot following Eq. \u00015\u0002, as shown in Fig. 5. It illustrates that\nthere is hardly any variation in detrapping time with voltage.\nThe absence of electric field dependence indicates that mul-\ntiple trapping-detrapping effects are negligible. The graph\nyields an activation energy of the trap of 0.29\u00b10.02 eV. A\ndefect with similar time characteristics has been found pre-\nviously in single37 and polycrystalline diamond17,18 and is in\nagreement with the activation energy of a boron related de-\nfect identified by photon and electron beam induced current\ntransient studies.38,39\nV.

This is consistent with nitrogen and\ndislocations acting as recombination centers,40 reducing the\nlifetime and hence the CCE, as it has been reported and\ndiscussed previously.34\nFigure 7 gives a comparison of the IBIC spectra ac-\nquired from the whole scan area compared to a selected high\nquality region of the device. In addition, the performance\nobtained with the non-collimated \u0001 source irradiating the\nwhole detector area is also displayed. Figure 7\u0001a\u0002 demon-\nstrates that the electron signals acquired during the ion beam\nirradiations are comparable to the ones acquired with the \u0001\nsource. Thus the electron transport is hardly dependent on\nthe ion species, interaction depth, and incident dose rate.\nCCEs above 90% are achieved over a wide area of the de-\nvice. In contrast to that, in a hole sensitive mode, the detector\nshows a greatly improved performance in the ion beam com-\npared to the \u0001 irradiation. In the literature, an increase of\nsignal height with increasing depth range of the incident ra-\ndiation has been suggested, due to enhanced trapping at a\nhighly defective contact interface layer.41 This is unlikely to\nbe the reason in our case, as electron transport does not show\nthe same effect. The improved hole CCE observed during the\nproton beam irradiation is most likely caused by the approxi-\nmately 50 times larger incident particle rate of the ion beam.\nCreated charge carriers fill the deep trap levels within the\nbulk material, which stay occupied by the trapped charge\nover long time scales. The trapping probability for subse-\nquently created charge carriers reduces and their lifetime and\nthe CCE increase. High CCE centroids, as shown in Fig.\n7\u0001b\u0002, were only observed in the IBIC experiments, where the\neffect of priming due to irradiation is much stronger than\nduring the \u0001-experiments, due to the larger incident dose rate\non to the device. It can be assumed that priming is respon-\nsible for the deactivation of bulk hole traps,42,43 which ex-\nplains the stronger effect on hole transport than on the elec-\ntron performance.\nThe CCE images acquired at very low voltages shown in\nFig. 8 seem to complement each other, i.e., areas with low\nelectron CCE have a large hole CCE and vice versa. This\neffect is at least partly caused by the buildup of polarization\nfields of different strengths and directions within the differ-\nent areas of the detector. This will enhance the signal under\nexternal bias for one polarity and decrease it for the opposite\none. The presence of these varying fields has been confirmed\nby signal pulses acquired without external bias supply. These\n0 V data show signals of both polarities simultaneously de-\npending on the detector position. The polarization and prim-\ning phenomena are discussed in more detail by Sellin et al.44\nDue to the polarization, the electric field throughout the de-\nvice is not known and probably not homogenous, which pre-\nvents a sensible evaluation of the voltage dependence of the\nCCE as a function of voltage for each pixel position in terms\nof the Hecht equation, which would yield a spatial \u0004\u0006\ndistribution.45\nUnfortunately, it is not clear yet how these variations in\npolarization are correlated to the spatial defect distribution\nwithin the sample; the data only suggest a systematic change\nalong the growth direction, with clear changes across the\nnitrogen doped layers. It is known that nitrogen increases the\ndiamond growth rate in polycrystalline CVD46 and therefore\nmust influence some part of the synthesis mechanism, which\ncould subsequently influence the defect distribution. Recent\nIBIC studies of polycrystalline diamond detectors at elevated\ntemperatures up to 600 K suggest that space charge and thus\npolarization effects concentrated at grain boundaries are re-\nduced at higher temperatures leading to a more homogenous\ndetector response.47\nAlthough the performance of the sample studied in this\nwork is expected to be affected by the nitrogen impurities\nwhich had been introduced on purpose, intrinsic space\ncharge \u0001internal fields19\u0002 and polarization effects48 have also\nbeen found by other groups in single crystal diamonds grown\nby the same company; but more recent results suggest that\nthese internal space charges and\/or polarization may not oc-\ncur in more recently produced highest quality material, also\nsynthesized by Element Six Ltd.49\nThe 10%\u201390% rise time image extracted from the digital\nIBIC data acquired simultaneously to the data shown in Fig.\n8\u0001b\u0002 at +30 V is displayed in Fig. 9. It highlights that the\npulse rise times are longer in two distinct areas. One of them,\nlabeled A, has very low CCE values, whereas in area B, just\nabove the HTHP substrate, CCEs are above 80%, even at this\nlow field strength. Induced charge pulses acquired within\nareas A and B at 296 and 270 K are shown in Figs. 10 and\n11, respectively. They demonstrate that the rise times of the\nFIG. 7.

Thus, the slow\ncharge transport in this area is caused by a reduced charge\ncarrier velocity, hardly dependent on temperature. The reduc-\ntion of hole velocity in this region is in agreement with the\nspatial distribution of polarization observed in this sample,\ni.e., reduced effective field strength.\nIn contrast, the pulses induced in area B shown in Fig.\n11 display the characteristic combination of a fast component\nand a slow component, typical for delayed charge transport\ndue to detrapping. The slow component has a clearly longer\nrise time at 270 K compared to 296 K and does not vary\nwith the applied electric field. It is in agreement with the\ntime characteristic of the trap level analyzed and discussed\nearlier. Our measurement shows that the responsible defect is\nonly found very close to the substrate\/CVD interface and\ncould be caused by boron introduced during the initial\ngrowth stage into the CVD material from the substrate. The\nsame reason might explain the observation of that trap in a\nthin \u000180 \u0004m\u0002 nominally undoped single crystal CVD dia-\nmond grown on an HTHP diamond substrate by Balducci et\nal.25\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThe charge transport in a synthetic single crystal dia-\nmond containing areas of deliberately introduced nitrogen,\ngrown by Element Six Ltd., has been studied. The \u0004\u0006 prod-\nuct for electrons and holes did not change significantly with\ntemperature between 200 and 300 K, which is in agreement\nwith a very small increase of mobility within that tempera-\nture range.3\nPolarization has been found in the device, and IBIC im-\naging revealed that the internal polarization field distribution\nseems to be related to the growth direction of the crystal.\nFurthermore, hole transport was strongly affected by incident\ndose rate changes due to priming.\nWe have confirmed the degradation of charge transport\nproperties for electrons and holes related to nitrogen impuri-\nties. Additionally, a weak degradation due to the presence of\ndislocations was also found, which is in agreement with lit-\nerature suggesting that nitrogen as well as dislocations can\nact as recombination centres40 and therefore reduce carrier\nlifetime.\nRe-emission of holes out of shallow trap levels was ob-\nserved in transient charge pulses. We presented a method to\nextract the detrapping time by fitting the slow component of\nthese transient wave forms on a pulse by pulse basis. Analy-\nsis of these pulses as a function of temperature yields an\nactivation energy of 0.29\u00b10.02 eV, which indicates possibly\na boron related hole trap.\nDigital IBIC imaging was used to probe spatial varia-\ntions in charge transport, and it has been shown that the\neffect of that shallow trap on the diamond detector signal is\nlimited to an area very close to the HTHP substrate\/CVD\ninterface of the material. It was clearly distinguished from a\nFIG. 9. 10%\u201390% rise time distribution of hole transport sensitive pulses\nacquired at 296 K, +30 V.
