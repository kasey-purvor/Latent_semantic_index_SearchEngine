US \nconversion is set for 2009 and the Geneva 2006 \nAgreement (International Telecommunication Union, \n2006 [website]) means that in 2015 legal protection \nof analogue TV transmission along a country\u2019s \nborders will be removed in Europe, Africa and parts \nof Asia with a complete transition to digital \nbroadcast by 2020. \n \nThe move to digital from analogue offers some \nremarkable possibilities for viewers, broadcasters \nand programme makers. In addition to improvements \nsuch as choice (the UK currently has only five \nanalogue broadcast channels) and an improvement in \npicture quality and sound, there is a range of \npossibilities for new types of content. These include \ninteractive services, data casting and \nniche\/community broadcast channels. In essence, \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nanything that can be represented in digital form can \nbe broadcast, ranging from computer programs and \nwebsites to instructions for home automation \nsystems. \n \nResearch within households tells us the practical \ndevelopment of these possibilities is being stifled by \na lack of engagement with current iTV services by \nusers. The overarching aim of the research on which \nthis paper is drawing is the identification and \nresolution of these problems with user engagement in \niTV. We argue that the control and access to \ninteractive content is restricted by current interaction \nmodels, that is, the conventional remote control (see \nEngland & Finney, 2002; Eronen & Vuorimaa, 2000; \nand Steemens, 1998).  This was supported by our \nexperience in the fieldwork but clearly this is a \ncomplex picture informed by the services on offer \nand their marketing, user perceptions and willingness \nto engage with new technology. A more sophisticated \nform of input and control needs to be introduced for \niTV to reach its full potential.  \n \nWe present research that tested the use of personal \ntouch screen devices, in this case Personal Digital \nAssistants (PDAs), as a mechanism for accessing \niTV services and controlling television operating \nsystems (for example, Electronic Programme Guides \n(EPGs)) without having to interrupt broadcast \nprogrammes at all. The objectives of this research \nwere: \n \n\u2022 To identify some of the barriers to usage of \ncurrent digital TV systems through a series of \ninterviews in the homes of a representative sample of \nthe current users of digital TV; \n\u2022 To design technically realistic, near-future iTV \nservices and infrastructure led by this initial \ninvestigation; and \n\u2022 To test our hypothesis that new modes of \ninteraction can help to remove barriers to the use of \niTV services by taking simulations using live TV \ninto the homes of study participants. \n \nRESEARCH METHODS \nThroughout this project qualitative methods were \nmainly employed, using interview and participant \nobservations. We selected 20 households (62 people) \nin different socio-economic groups - ABC1 C2DE \n(Bocock, 1993) from the Greater London area. In \naddition to socio-economic status this sample \nrepresented a cross section of household size, from \nsingle occupants to families of 6. 17 out of the 20 \nhouseholds subscribed to Sky (a UK satellite service) \nand 3 households subscribed to Telewest (a UK cable \nTV service). \n \nHouseholds were visited three times. The first two \nvisits were made to build a trusting rapport with the \nparticipants and to study the overall media \nconsumption within each household. The initial visits \nnormally lasted between 60 and 90 minutes, \ndepending on the number of people in a household. \nThe second visit was carried out a month after the \nfirst. Here participants were not only interviewed but \nwere also asked to demonstrate how they actually use \nTV remote controls, EPG services, interactive TV \ncontent (games, shopping, information, etc.) and the \nInternet. \n \nThe third visit involved the installation and testing of \nnew prototype iTV interfaces and hardware systems \ndeveloped in response to the initial visits. \n \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nRESULTS: INTERVIEW \nOne of the most important aspects of the project was \nto understand how users perceived the new medium \nof interactive TV.  For our participants interactivity \nmeant: \u2018interacting with friends\u2019, \u2018more options\u2019, \n\u2018select and control\u2019, \u2018saving time\u2019, \u2018more \ninformation\u2019, \u2018personal service\u2019, \u2018giving you \nchoices\u2019. This is on the understanding that it can be \napplied to almost anything users do whilst they \naccess programmes or websites. \n \nThe exploratory study also revealed that interactivity \nis only perceived as a positive concept when it is \nsafe and secure. As Adel says, \u2018interactivity can be a \ngood thing, but only if it is safe\u2019, indicating that \nthere are risks to using new technology. This \nperception was also echoed by several other \nrespondents. For instance, Rickey states that, \u2018I don\u2019t \nthink I\u2019ll use it for playing games or gambling\u2019, \nwhen speaking of his concern about the security \nissues involved with the new technology. According \nto Sally, a 30-year-old sub-editor, \u2018It means you are \nplaces, things like voting, buying and gaming. Some \n[are] more complicated. I like dramas, I use \n[interactive services] to get more information and \nstuff\u2019. For her interactivity takes the viewer to \n\u2018places\u2019 away from the main space of the TV \nprogramme or channel, to a space designed for \nconsumers to buy things or to gamble. \n \nMost of the respondents used few functions available \nfrom their iTV services, preferring to focus on \nfamiliar features suitable for their needs, rather than \ntrying out a wide range functions. The EPG was \nregarded as the most useful interactive function as it \nallows people to navigate through the multi-channel \nenvironment. As a study participant put it, \u2018You just \nlook at what you\u2019ve got now, and find what is on \nnow.\u2019 \n \nThe \u2018reminder\u2019 function was also popular amongst \nrespondents as it was thought to be easy to use. This \nfunction (provided by both Sky and Telewest) allows \nusers to flag programs they wish to watch from the \nEPG using the remote. According to Mark, an 18-\nyear-old student: \u2018I like that a lot, I can never be \nbothered with the [EPG]... I just set the reminder, \nand then it comes on three minutes before the \nprogramme starts\u2019. Similarly another respondent \nfound the reminder function very convenient. She \nsaid \u2018if we are watching something else, and I put it \non, and it comes up and kids say, \u201cMum, it will be in \n5 minutes\u201d\u2019.  However, other respondents did not \nknow how to control the reminder function.  For \nexample \u2018I can\u2019t get the reminder, and can\u2019t get rid \nof it, it actually stays there. So I am funny about \nusing it, because if I use it, I can\u2019t watch other \nprogrammes\u2019. \n \nThe issue of design was dominated by participants\u2019 \nattitudes to and experiences of interactive media: \nparticipants\u2019 positive or negative experiences of \nusing interactive functions framed their responses to \nthe design of iTV functions and services. In terms of \ninteractive television, participants most wanted the \nfunctions to be designed to offer the quickest route \nto content, and not take the user away from the main \nviewing experience. For example, the reason that \nparticipants liked the EPG was because it is simple \nto use and offers a direct route to TV programmes. \nConversely, the reasons respondents gave to justify \ntheir dislike for the A-Z listings in the EPG were \ncentred on it being confusing, taking too long and \nthe picture often freezing.  \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nRESPONSE TO THE FIRST TWO VISITS \nOur initial investigation provided a range of insights \ninto the way users of iTV think about and interact \nwith TV and interactive services. These insights led \nus to consider how we might investigate further these \nissues in a third and final visit to study participants\u2019 \nhomes. \n \nSECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nA key theme identified in the first study was the \nconflict between the core functions of TV systems, \nnamely displaying the TV picture itself, and the \nauxiliary functions which support them. Many of our \nstudy participants valued greatly the information \nservices offered by their iTV systems, such as the \nEPG, but the need for these to occupy the same \ndisplay space as the main image was a cause for \nconflict. \n \nThis led us towards the concept of introducing a \nportable second screen to the iTV interaction \nmechanism. A portable second screen offers the \nopportunity to remove the need to show UI elements \non the main television screen. This avoids many of \nthe problems related to UI latency\/reaction speed in \niTV systems; viewers are not going to miss broadcast \ninformation due to an interactive service not \nresponding rapidly enough. Users told us slow UI \nresponses are especially frustrating when exiting \nfrom iTV services back to the normal picture, a \nproblem that a second screen obviates immediately. \n \nA second screen approach also offers the opportunity \nto extend the model of iTV operation by offering a \nfar richer interaction mechanism than conventional \nremote control devices. It also allows for the  \n \ndynamic reconfiguration of the UI to reflect a user\u2019s \nneeds and desires. This could be a matter of personal \npreference or could represent a major enhancement \nof possibilities for those with significant \nimpairments which affect their interaction with iTV \nservices. \n \nThe control device \nWith a move away from infrared communication \nbetween TV\/set-top box and remote, the control \ndevice would not have to be pointed directly at the \ntelevision set to function, allowing it to be used in a \nmore casual \u2018lean back\u2019 position or even from a \ndifferent room. This is another facet to iTV where \nbroadcast programmes and iTV services co-exist in a \nparallel relationship rather than one having to \ndisplace the other on a single television display. \n \nWhile the role of the TV remote control has changed \nsignificantly over the past decade with the advent of \nmore complex TV content, the domestic television \nremote control has changed little. There are many \ncommercially available remote controls which break \nthe traditional mould, such as Philips Pronto, Pacific \nNeotek\u2019s OmniRemote, the OneForAll URC\u20139990 \nMosaic, Marantz\u2019s RC9500 and Logitech\u2019s Harmony \n1000. Such devices allow for the mapping of \nmultiple operations to one soft keystroke, however \nthey do not interact with iTV services in a different \nmode to traditional television remote controls. \nCrucially these \u2018universal\u2019 remote control devices do \nnot have the ability to interface directly with \nbroadcast content, including the custom interfaces \nused in iTV services. As such these devices are an \naggregation of conventional remote functions rather \nthan offering new iTV possibilities. \n \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nA study closely related to ours was on an integrated \nuse of a PDA, TV and set-top box to demonstrate an \nestate agency service (Robertson et al, 1996). \nAlthough this research was concerned with detailing \nguidelines for iTV interaction via a portable touch-\nscreen device it did not focus upon interaction with \nthe TV as a whole, instead concentrating on only a \nsingle iTV service. There have also been projects \nassociated with the use of touch pads (but not touch-\nsensitive screens) as part of remote controls (Enns & \nMackenzie, 1998) and on using PDAs to control \nhousehold electronics with both stylus and speech \ninput (De Vet & Buil, 1999; Nichols et al, 2002), \nplus projects that control TV in a multi-user context \nwith mobile phones (Park et al, 2006). Interestingly, \nnone of these systems, prototypical or commercial, \nseek to employ portable second screen devices to \nchange the core iTV user interaction model for \nexploring available content and consuming iTV \nservices in a cohesive and user-friendly manner. \n \nTouch-screen interaction \nWe investigated a touch-screen mode of interaction \nas likely to support a suitable degree of device-\nindependence for our research outcomes. It has \nalready been established that portable touch-screen \ndevices such as PDAs can work closely with iTV \nservices to take advantage of the benefits of both \ndevices, the TV offering high quality visual\/audio \noutput and the PDA offering interaction through \ncomplex input and the display of simple graphics, \nsuch as floor plans in the estate agent service \n(Robertson et al, 1996). \n \nThere is also evidence that using a PDA for \ninteractive activities around the home can result in a \n50 per cent reduction in time spent, with a 50 per \ncent reduction in error rate compared to using the \ndevice\u2019s standard (though not necessarily remote \ncontrolled) UI (Nichols et al, 2002; Nichols, 2001). \nSuch dramatic benefits are not necessarily to be \nexpected for television as they have high quality \ndisplays, which can provide good user feedback, \nunlike the primitive monochromatic displays of some \nhousehold appliances. Looking at the use of PDAs in \ninteractive situations in the home De Vet & Buil \npresent research that describes the development of a \nUI that does not simply replicate the conventional \nhardware remote layout using a PDA screen (De Vet \n& Buil, 1999). They note the key advantage we have \nexpanded upon: the possibility of remote device \ncontrol, specifically with respect to television, \nwithout the need to disturb the viewing of others. \n \nThis is not to say that small touch-screen devices \nsuch as PDAs are without UI drawbacks; the small \nscreen, lack of a full-sized keyboard and the lack of \ntactile feedback from the screen are all issues which \nmust be addressed. Much research looks into the \nchallenges of information visualization and \ninteraction under such constraints, too much to cover \nin detail here. Relevant areas of concern include the \ndevelopment of semi-transparent widget overlays for \nvisualization of information (Kamba et al, 1996) and \nemploying various strategies to mitigate the \nproblems of small screen web browsing (Wobbrock \net al, 2002). Such strategies include variable zoom \non different areas of a document or UI, Rapid Serial \nVisual Presentation (RSVP) of text and the \nexploitation of hardware buttons. \n \nEPG interaction \nOur initial investigation also informed our decision \nthat the EPG would be the focal point of our \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nprototype system. We found that much of the \nresearch in this area is based around traditional \nhardware remote controls with a number of studies \nnoting the need for improved usability in EPGs and \niTV products (Black et al, 1994). Daly-Jones and \nCarey note specifically the problems with hardware \nremote controls, including poor mapping of functions \nbetween remote and display, poor feedback for users \nactions with the remote and invisible functions found \nonly on the remote and not represented on screen \n(Daly-Jones & Carey, 2002). There have been some \nnovel solutions for problems associated with EPGs \nincluding (Eronen & Vuorimaa, 2000) which tests \nnew EPG models based around an infrared remote \nand TV. Two other studies (Smyth and Cotter, 2000; \nIsobe et al, 2005) investigate automatic personalized \nrecommendation systems for TV programmes to \nfilter unwanted content. \n \nPROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT \nResponding to the two sets of home visits and the \nexisting research as described above, we designed a \n\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \n \nsystem that addresses some of the identified barriers \nto user engagement with iTV services. This system \nconsists of physical or hardware components, new \nuser interfaces and (outside the scope of this paper) \nsupporting software infrastructure. \n \nUser interface \nIn this design we were led by our initial research \nbroadly in terms of the removal of text from the main \nviewing screen, but also in details such as the use of \nchannel logos for channel identification. We also \nexploited the high resolution of the screen in the \ndevice selected (200 ppi) to give us more flexibility \nin the graphic design of the UI.  \n \nThe interface operates in landscape orientation; this \nallows a horizontal time axis on the EPG and \ntherefore more items per channel to be shown. The \ndefault view on start-up (shown in Figures 1a and \n1b) can be broadly split into three horizontal areas of \nactivity.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1a. Initial state of the PDA UI. \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1b. Further details of the PDA UI \n \nAt the bottom of the layout there is a global bar; this \nis always visible during any operation and provides \ninstant access to the basic remote control functions \n(volume, mute, channel +\/-) along with a channel \nhistory. The latter was included due to comments \nfrom our initial study in which users expressed a \ndesire to be able to navigate back to previous \nchannels without having to go back into the EPG, \nremember what channel they were watching and \nscroll to that channel. The channel history keeps a \nrolling record of the last five channels visited, much \nlike a web browser (see Figure 2).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Channel history expanding menu. \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \n \n \nFigure 3. User settings and log-in. \n \nAbove the global bar is the \u2018favourites\u2019 area \ncontaining a number of buttons for one-press access \nto channels, identified via channel logos. Users\u2019 \nfavourites can also be dynamically added\/removed in \nthe settings section (see Figure 3). A full \nimplementation would be likely to include a simple \nuser-switching feature to allow several groups of \nuser-specific favourites to be maintained. \n \nThe EPG occupies the upper half of the layout; this \nhas a horizontal time axis with icons to represent \nchannels. Pressing these icons changes the channel \non the television, just like the buttons in the \n\u2018favourites\u2019 area. Tapping on a particular programme \nin the EPG expands the item to show additional \ninformation in the EPG including a programme \ndescription, record\/remind functions and access to \ninteractive services if available (see Figure 4). A \n  \n \nsecond tap within the expanded programme returns it \nto its original state. \n \nThe EPG uses a drag-and-release interaction to \nnavigate around the plane of programmes. This \nincreases the real estate available for content display \nas it removes the need for scroll bars, while also \nreducing visual clutter. Tapping the home button \n(left-hand end of the global bar) takes the EPG to the \ncurrent time and programme being viewed on the \ntelevision. \n \nDragging the EPG is innovative but potentially \nproblematic in that this control mechanism is not \nmade visible in the UI.  \n \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Additional programme information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Expanding touch-sensitive volume menu. \n \nAdditionally, during dragging there is inevitably a \nhigh degree of screen occlusion by the hand\/finger if \na stylus is not used. The first problem is mitigated by \nthe ease with which the interaction method can be \nlearned. The second problem applies not only to \ndragging the EPG, but also to the entire UI if it is to  \n \nbe finger-operable. It can be solved to some extent \nby creating buttons that provide visual feedback that \ncan be seen around the sides of the finger as they are \npressed. A special realization of this principle was \ndeveloped for programme-specific functions (remind, \nrecord, repeats), channel history, the settings menu \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nand volume (see Figure 5). These \u2018popup\u2019 menus are \nsemi-transparent to help reinforce their transient \nnature while providing access to additional functions \nin a space-efficient manner (Kamba et al, 1996).  \n \nHARDWARE \nOur prototype consisted of a laptop computer capable \nof receiving Freeview TV that could be connected \ndirectly to participants\u2019 TVs. The laptop could \nfunction in two distinct modes: the first allowed the \nTV channel to be changed using the PDA connected \nto the laptop via Bluetooth; the second allowed \ncontrol over the laptop via a generic infrared iTV \nremote control. This set-up allowed us to perform \nevaluations using either the PDA or a traditional on-\nscreen UI using the same basic hardware. \n \nBoth the on-screen UI and the PDA UI used standard \nTV-Anytime metadata (Bleb.org, TV Anytime, 2007 \n[website]). This allowed us to provide a real time \nEPG as part of the PDA and on-screen UI. This, \ncombined with live Freeview TV, made our \nprototype simulations as transparent as possible. \n \nTESTING METHODOLOGY \nTo establish the validity of our analysis of the initial \ninterviews we returned to the sample of households \nfrom our first two visits and undertook a series of \nstructured and unstructured interviews\/focus group \nsessions, each with audio and video recording of the \nusers\u2019 interaction with the iTV services via our \nsecond screen and on-screen prototypes. \n \nParticipants were asked to interact with two sets of \niTV service simulations, an EPG and a music video \nclip voting application (these voting services are not \ndocumented in this paper). Users were asked to \ninteract with the same services, operating them using \nboth of our two prototype modes: with a traditional \nremote control and with our PDA remote control. \n \nUsers were instructed in the use of both prototype \nmodes for a few minutes at the start of sessions. We \ninitially supplied and demonstrated the PDA without \na stylus; during the session we asked users whether \nthey would like to use a stylus and supplied one if \nrequested. \n \nIt should be noted that there were some variables that \ninterfered with the effectiveness of the testing. \nFreeview reception, surprisingly, is not universally \navailable in all areas of Greater London, which \nrequired the reversion to a backup of displaying a \nstill image of the chosen channel in a few cases.  \nThis compromised the quality of the simulation as a \nbelievable iTV service in those houses not \ncontrolling live TV with our system. Also due to \nhardware performance problems, our prototype\u2019s live \ntelevision was limited to approximately 15 channels. \nPerformance problems exclusive to the PDA meant \nthat the EPG portion of the UI had to be visually \nsimplified, resulting in the removal of rounded \ncorners and background gradients from programme \nitems in the EPG. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nInitial results indicate that user reaction towards the \npresentation of the EPG on a second screen is very \npositive. The majority of the participants \nacknowledged the usefulness of employing such a \nhandheld device to display and interact with the TV \nguide while leaving the main TV picture free of any \ngraphics. Teenagers and women were the most \nenthusiastic users of the system finding it more user-\nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nfriendly and straightforward when compared to the \nconventional on-screen iTV UI.  Example responses \ninclude Annette\u2019s: \u2018I think it makes more clear what \nis going on\u2026I think it\u2019s quite easy to use\u2019; and \nMargaret\u2019s: \u2018I prefer this to the one on the screen, \nI\u2019d prefer to have this.\u2019 \n \nThere was doubtless a novelty factor at play when \nparticipants evaluated the PDA against the more \ntraditional on-screen UI. This was especially evident \nin the reactions of children and teenagers, for \ninstance Janette\u2019s son (14 years old) said, \u2018Oh, this is \ngreat... I\u2019ll probably get one of these for Christmas.\u2019  \n \nIt is very interesting that, although a portable gadget \nsuch as the PDA would seem likely to appeal more to \nmale respondents (as one of the study participants \npointed out, \u2018I think this gadget would be more \npopular with the fellows\u2019), in fact, it was women \nwho especially found the PDA system and mode of \ninteraction preferable and were very keen to adopt it.  \nFor example, Diane says, \u2018I don\u2019t know why but this \nfeels less threatening. I find it easier.\u2019 \n \nMen on the other hand seem to be more sceptical \nabout the introduction of such handheld devices in \ntheir living room environment and were especially \nconcerned about its pricing.  Paul says \u2018I think it\u2019s \nexpensive for people to buy that\u2019, while Mark \ncomments \u2018If you lose the remote control [it would \ncost you \u00a310], if you lose this it\u2019ll cost you a lot.\u2019 \n \nAnother concern raised by several male respondents \nwas in response to direct interaction with the PDA. \nWhen a stylus was present it was generally easier for \nthem to interact with the device, compared with \nwhen they initially attempted to control the PDA \nwith their fingers, as illustrated by Angelo: \u2018I would \nsay you [would] probably be better off with a stylus, \nespecially for someone like me with dummy fingers\u2019; \nand Peter: \u2018I think it responds better with a pen, with \na finger it did not respond quite so well\u2019. \n \nParticipants also commented on the superior \nlegibility of text on the PDA screen, as explained by \nDiane: \u2018Oh [the text size is] fine, because it\u2019s here \nand not all around over there then that\u2019s fine. I can \nread that no problem\u2019; Mike: \u2018I like this its great, in \na way it\u2019s better [than the TV screen] cos you\u2019ve got \nit in front of you like a book\u2019; and Margaret: \u2018I can \nread [the PDA] better\u2026 I need new glasses but I can \nread this anyway\u2019. \n \nWhile this preference for the second screen device \ntest could be attributed to the much higher physical \nresolution of the device we suggest that the mobility \nof the PDA also played a part. Moving the device \nnearer and further from the eyes was a common \nobservation in our study, suggesting users could \neasily suit their own reading distance preferences.  \n \nA note of caution needs to be introduced here. We \ndeveloped a parallel set of interfaces, one for \nconventional remotes and one for second screen to \nmitigate the novelty factor in terms of interface, and \nthe feedback we received identified specific factors \nthat were an improvement on conventional viewing. \nThe degree that novelty played in the positive \nresponses we received for this system is an open \nquestion without a long-term study that was outside \nthe scope of this pilot project. \n \nCONCLUSION \nWe believe we have demonstrated that from a user\u2019s \nTHE DESIGN JOURNAL, VOLUME 10, ISSUE 3 \n \n \nPAPERS \n \nMAKING INTERACTIVE TV EASIER TO USE INTERFACE DESIGN FOR A SECOND SCREEN APPROACH \nperspective that there are significant problems with \nthe current design of UIs and services for UK iTV \nproducts. A new approach is required that goes \nbeyond the hard button remote control paradigm if \niTV services are to be truly successful. The second \nscreen system we have developed and tested offers \nsignificant advantages over conventional remote \ncontrols when using iTV services: users show a \nstrong preference for this system over conventional \nremote controls, something we attribute primarily to \nthe mobility of the PDA and its superior \nvisualization of service information. \n \nReservations about the PDA system were recorded, \nlinked both to the perceived cost of the units and the \ndifficulty of finger-based interaction with the touch \nscreen. As the technology develops, costs will \ndecrease. It is likely that a commercial realization of \nthis approach would utilize the user\u2019s mobile phone \nas a display and control device. In the UK, Sky have \na very rudimentary control by phone system, \nhowever it was in only the last few months of the \nstudy that mobile phone technology had sufficient \nprocessing power to meet the technical needs of our \nprototype hardware. \n \nBy using an \u2018intelligent\u2019 second screen for \ndisplaying interactive elements and for TV control \nwe provide an uninterrupted broadcast experience on \nthe TV itself, addressing an important concern \nhighlighted in our first study, while providing \nsuperior interaction with iTV services for iTV users. \n \nThe flexibility of a second screen allows for the \npotential for individual and modifiable interfaces to \ncontrol universal broadcast iTV services. While this \nmay be interesting for the everyday individual it has \nprofound implications for those with disabilities and \nthose providers who in the UK under the Disability \nDiscrimination Act (1995) are legally bound to \nprovide an equivalent service to all users.  We are \ncurrently working with the BBC and others in \ndeveloping a longer-term project that provides for \nlonger term in-home testing of technologies for \nincreasing the accessibility of iTV. \n \nREFERENCES \nBlack, A., Bayley, O., Burns, C., Kuuluvainen, I.  & Stoddard, J . \n(1994). \u2018Keeping viewers in the picture: real world usability \nprocedures in the development of a television control interface\u2019. \nIn Plaisant, C.
