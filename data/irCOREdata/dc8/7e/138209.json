The \ncurrent literature encompassing ICT, marketing and HR is reviewed and used as a \nguide for the design of the single case pilot study. \n \nFindings \nOverall, the results indicate that managers who perceive their expectations as being \nmet, express satisfaction with the HR Intranet and record increased satisfaction with \nthe HR function.  However, differences of perceptions emerge concerning this \nsatisfaction between HR managers (i.e. suppliers) and other managers (i.e. \ncustomers).  The findings also indicate that the effectiveness of communication \nconcerning information about new technology (including that of training, marketing, \nuser involvement and feedback) influences managers\u2019 perceptions of satisfaction with \nboth the HR Intranet and the HR function. \n \nResearch Limitations\/Implications \nThese findings suggest that the Intranet can play a powerful part in helping HR to \nbuild a closer and more satisfactory relationship with its customers in order to achieve \nmutual organisational benefit.  However, this preliminary study also emphasises the \nneed for further research on the impact and effectiveness of the HR Intranet. \n \nOriginality\/Value \nThis paper begins the process of filling a substantial gap in the literature and provides \na framework from which further research can be continued. \n \nKeywords: \nHR function; Intranet; Internet; satisfaction; role theory; expectations; internal \ncustomers and suppliers. \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n2 \nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe role of managers in the workplace has changed substantially in recent years, \npartly as a result of market developments, but also due to new technologies used by \nthe organisations in which they work.  As a result, internal service providers, such as \nthe Human Resource (HR) function, have been forced to re-examine their own role in \nthe light of a dramatic increase of organisational demands on them (Gloet and Berrell, \n2003).  Certain writers consider these demands to be contradictory as the requirement \nis to be simultaneously strategic, flexible, efficient, cost-effective and customer-\noriented (Lepak and Snell, 1998).  In addition, due to the differing roles of managers, \nwho form one category of HR\u2019s internal customer base, it has been increasingly \nrecognised that HR needs to improve its customer orientation (Mabey et al, 1998; \nBacon, 1999; Huselid and Becker, 1999; Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2002) so as to \nidentify internal customers\u2019 consequential changing expectations (Floyd and Lane, \n2000).  Within such a context, it is generally accepted that the more strategic the \napproach to human resource management (HRM), the greater the contribution of \nHRM to organisational performance as HRM is considered to powerfully impact on \nthe policies, practices and systems that influence employees\u2019 behaviour, attitude and \nperformance (Gloet and Berrell, 2003).  For example, one aspect of this shifting role-\nand-expectation equation has been the increased responsibility of managers for \nactivities previously carried out by the HR function (McGovern et al, 1997).  Such \ndevelopment highlights the need to provide support in areas such as training, \ninformation and documentation according to the individual needs of the managers \nconcerned to achieve the objectives of all parties.  Thus, the more aligned HRM \nstrategies are with the business, the greater the contribution to quality practices and \noverall organisational performance (Gloet and Berrell, 2003), highlighted as being \ndriven by both customer requirements and increasing intensity of competition \n(Redman and Mathews, 1998). \n \nChanges in the sophistication and availability of information technologies (IT) are \nalso gaining increasing momentum.  Whilst research on the impact of IT often \nsuggests contradictory organisational consequences and user satisfaction outcomes \n(Robey and Boudreau, 1999), there is general agreement that its impact on the way we \nwork is enormous and far-reaching.  For instance, technology is accelerating the pace \nof work as customers expect faster responses (Cooper, 1999).  Scope has also \nincreased as Internet technology enables thousands of individual computer networks \nall over the world to be linked, encompassing a range of capabilities not possible with \nprevious business processes.  Yet, whilst much has been written on the impact of the \nuse of Internet technology on businesses\u2019 external relationships, little has been said \nsince Legge (1989) about its influence on the relationship between internal service-\nproviding functions and their customers.  Legge (1989), in particular, contemplated \nwhether the HRM function should play a more proactive role in relation to new \ntechnologies. \n \nNew technologies, such as the Internet, enable internal service providers, such as HR, \nto supply their services to their internal customers with a capability and degree of \ninteraction not previously possible (Alleyne, 2003).  Thus, there is little constraint on \ntime, place or service provider availability.  The potential for customisation and \nflexibility allows managers to control the information and services they receive.  The \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n3 \ntechnology also enables the HR function to closely develop relationships with its \nconstituencies (Tsui, 1987) and provides opportunities for greater effectiveness and \nsatisfaction of both parties.  However, whilst internal customer satisfaction and user \nsatisfaction is identified as important to both external customer satisfaction (Bowen \nand Schneider, 1988; Heskett et al, 1994) and IS success respectively (Ives and Olson, \n1984; DeLone and McLean, 1992), the HR function has lagged behind other internal \nfunctions in its adoption of IS\/IT innovations (Dunivan, 1991; Martinsons, 1997).  \nThe HR function has not been proactive in its use of Internet technology in order to \nprovide integrated services or to communicate more effectively with its customers to \nelicit and fulfil their changing expectations (Elliott and Tevavichulada, 1999). \n \nWith such perspectives in mind, the aim of this paper is to present findings from an \nexploratory case study examining the impact and usage of Internet technologies for \nHR applications within the organisation, the HR Intranet, on managers\u2019 satisfaction \nwith the HR function (Alleyne, 2003).  Using role theory to underpin the research, the \nmanagerial role expectations of both the HR function as an internal service provider \nand its use of HR Intranet applications (HRIA) has been investigated.  The research \nexamined whether a relationship existed between managers\u2019 expectations, their \nperceived realisation and satisfaction with both HR Intranet applications (i.e. on-line \napplications, for example, timesheets, holiday and sickness tracking, company news, \nand forthcoming events, and administration documents, such as employment policies, \non-line training and vacancies) and the HR function.  As a result of this inquiry, this \npaper sets the agenda for further research into key issues concerning the relationships \nidentified in this study. \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n4 \nMANAGERIAL ROLE EXPECTATIONS \n \nManagerial role expectations can be understood within the framework of role theory \n(Harris, 2004).  Katz and Kahn's (1978) study of roles explains how each focal unit, \nwhether individual or group, generates or accommodates certain role expectations \nthat, in turn, influence behaviour within the organisation.  Role relationships are \ntherefore postulated as being at the core of organisational effectiveness and the key to \neffective role behaviour through \u201clearning the expectations of others, accepting them, \nand fulfilling them\u201d (Katz and Kahn, 1978: 188). \n \nFondas and Stewart (1990:17), however, argue that earlier research does not recognise \nthat \u201cjobholders may not simply be reactive to expectations but may proactively \nchange and\/or create expectations and therefore the social environment\u201d.  In their \nextension of Katz and Kahn\u2019s (1978) theoretical model of factors involved in role \nformation, they suggest that the addition of \u2018expectation enactment\u2019 moves the \nrelationship from a passive to an active one, with the jobholder being an active \ncontributor in defining role expectations and behaviour.  Rodham (2000:72) also \nargues, \u201cmany approaches to the study of roles have focused upon behaviour without \nsetting it in the context of the role demands and expectations\u201d.  The suggestion is that \nrole behaviour is closely bound to a matrix of social relations.  At the same time, the \nuses made of technology by an individual are integral to a role analytic framework \nsince work roles are made up of a composite of tasks and skills that increasingly \ninclude the ability to effectively operate a range of different technologies which, in \nturn, impact on the nature of the surrounding inter-relationships.  Thus, behaviourally \nbased role theory offers the researcher a set of interrelated concepts by which to \nexplain links between adjacent levels of analysis (Barley, 1990). \n \nRole theory and its focus on expectations can usefully be extended to other fields of \ninterest, most pertinently, marketing and IT.  For example, in marketing literature, \nelements of role theory have been incorporated into existing service management \napproaches and utilised to examine both internal and external customer satisfaction \n(Soloman et al, 1985; Rodham, 2000), with expectation as a key variable found to \naffect satisfaction (Yi, 1990).  Supported by his research findings, Webb (2000) \nproposes a model that relates customer knowledge represented by \u2018experience\u2019 (from \ndirect involvement with the service provider) and \u2018familiarity\u2019 (exposure to vicarious \ninformation about the service provider) to customer expectations. \n \nIn effect, role theory, which can usefully be applied across all organisational \nfunctions, provides a strong and appropriate theoretical base to explore the \nrelationship between a service provider, their use of technology to discharge \nservice(s) and the effect on customers in terms of realising, or not, service receiver \nexpectations and resulting satisfaction. \n \nINTERNAL CUSTOMER AND USER SATISFACTION \n \nInternal marketing is defined as \u201cthe application of marketing, human resource \nmanagement, and allied theories, techniques, and principles to motivate, mobilise, co-\nopt, and manage employees at all levels to continuously improve the way they serve \nexternal customers and each other\u201d (Benoy, 1996:57).  The field of internal marketing \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n5 \nis growing increasingly important since research has repeatedly shown that satisfying \nthe needs and expectations of the internal customer will lead to positive external \nmarket outcomes (Bowen and Schneider, 1988; Heskett et al, 1994; Bowen, 1996).  A \nfurther relevant development, which research findings have also supported, has been \nthe recognition of the impact of marketing communication (Spreng et al, 1996) and its \neffect on both the formation of expectations as well as the resulting satisfaction \nachieved (Brooks et al, 1999). \n \nAs with the IT literature on satisfaction (Baroudi et al, 1986; Doll and Torkzadeh, \n1989; McKeen et al, 1994), the internal marketing literature regards customer \ninvolvement as an important part of the satisfaction outcome.  Brooks et al (1999) \nargue that both role identification and service involvement by the customer will affect \ntheir expectations, with those being most involved likely to experience the greater \nsatisfaction. \n \nThree key areas emerge from the literature that can be used to assess internal \ncustomer satisfaction with the Intranet services provided by the HR function.  The \nfirst concerns the technology itself and encompasses, among other factors, speed of \ntransaction processing, security, training, user involvement, ease of use and specific \nInternet technology research (DeLone and McLean, 1992; Phelps and Mok, 1999).  \nThe second, information content or quality (IQ), viewed as fitness for use by \nconsumers (Wang, 1998), is also identified as an antecedent for user satisfaction and \nkey factors such as usefulness, reliability and completeness, have been identified from \nvarious studies (DeLone and McLean, 1992; Wang and Strong, 1996).  The third key \narea, from the internal marketing literature, identifies appropriate factors associated \nwith service quality, which have been adapted for use when investigating satisfaction \nwith a specific technology (Hallowell et al, 1996; Brooks et al, 1999).  They include \nspeed of user interface response, applications on-line help facility and applications \ntask completion success rate (Brooks et al, 1999). \n \nHUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (HRM) \n \nAs a support function that provides services to its internal customers, the HR literature \nis increasingly recognising the importance of service quality that leads to internal \ncustomer satisfaction (Bowen, 1996) which, in turn, nurtures further organisational \nbenefits (Bowen and Schneider, 1988; Heskett et al, 1994).  This focus on the internal \nmarket requires the HR function to make two basic shifts in orientation.  The first is \nfrom a production to a service orientation in which HR becomes committed to internal \ncustomer satisfaction (Bowen and Greiner, 1986).  The second is to balance a \n\u2018technical merit\u2019 perspective with a \u2018user reaction\u2019 one.  This would mean that HRM \nadds internal customer satisfaction as a contribution to the list of criteria it uses to \nassess the effectiveness of HRM practices (Bowen, 1996). \n \nThe voice of those at the receiving end is considered to have been under-represented \nin the HRM literature, yet this is critical when considering that individuals are the \nprimary recipients and the \u2018consumers\u2019 of the various initiatives offered under the \nHRM banner (Clark et al, 1998).  One of the characteristic features of the HR \nliterature is the pivotal role ascribed to line managers as a delivery point for a variety \nof HR policies and practices (McGovern et al, 1997).  However, research has found \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n6 \nthat line managers were not adequately consulted about the devolution of \nresponsibilities and were, as a result, unclear about their roles (Bevan and Heyday, \n1994).  Tensions have been identified as existing between line managers and the HR \nfunction because of devolution.  Research also shows that line managers have \ndemonstrated frustration at being unable to devote sufficient time to HR activities \nbecause of the dominance of \u2018harder\u2019 priorities (Cunningham and Hyman, 1999). \n \nFurther, the HR function faces changing expectations that come from many different \nclients or constituencies (Tsui, 1987).  Understandably, the needs of various line \nmanagers are not the same, particularly when contrasting the needs of board members \nagainst the demands of supervisors of rank-and-file workers, but all require specific \nattention (Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2001).  It has been argued that HR needs to take \na proactive communication role within the organisation to \u201cestablish and nurture \nproductive relationships\u201d (Yate, 1992: 98) and harness the proven effect of \ncommunication on satisfaction, performance and profits (Heintzman et al, 1993).  \nThus, the emerging recommendation is that HR managers should look for ways to \nimprove communication with other managers and to use new technologies such as the \nIntranet as a support tool, on the basis that the \u201cmanagement and manipulation of \ninformation is becoming an increasingly important dimension of work\u201d (Bruce and \nBlackburn, 1992: 101).  In keeping with this line of thought, Bruce (1997) suggests \nthat much of the information that HR managers and employees share will be \nexchanged electronically.  He further recommends that \u201cscholars must explore how \nmanagers and workers perceive technological communication and what they want \nfrom it\u201d (Bruce, 1997: 428). \n \nIT has clearly been identified as having an important role to play in HR applications \n(Snell et al, 1995; Groe et al, 1996).  Yet, within the HR literature, which is still \ndebating what HR\u2019s role should be (Conner and Ulrich, 1996), with still differences of \nopinion to reconcile, little understanding or consideration of the impact that new \ntechnologies such as the Intranet can make on HR is exhibited (Lepak and Snell, \n1998).  To date, much of the HRM research regarding the use of both IT and the \nInternet, for example, focuses on HR professionals rather than the customers of their \nservices (Elliott and Tevavichulada, 1999).  Moreover, the literature also suggests that \nthere is a need for an informed understanding of developments in human resource \nstrategy (Morris and Wood, 1991; Boxhall, 1993; McCarthy, 1994) in order to address \nthe HR customer satisfaction issues (Redman and Mathews, 1998).  For example, \nMcCarthy (1994: 321) argues that like other frontiers of knowledge, HRM \u201ccries out \nfor a case study approach\u201d.  This notion is further supported by Boxhall's (1993: 653) \nview that the HRM field needs \u201cless representative but more intense case study \nmethods\u201d.  In turn, Redman and Mathews (1998: 75) conclude that HRM \u201cresearch \nstrategies that incorporate well designed and intense case study research will be \nparticularly valuable\u201d. \n \nMETHODOLOGY \n \nConsiderate of the case based argument (Redman and Mathews, 1998) and since the \nresearch undertaken is of an exploratory nature, a case study approach was adopted in \nthis study (Yin, 1994) with the additional objective of setting an agenda for \nsubsequent research.  Along the lines of the argument championed by McCarthy \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n7 \n(1994), Boxhall (1993) and Redman and Mathews (1998), the researchers did not \nconstruct specific hypotheses or propositions for the exploratory study, but instead \npreferred to identify issues for further study from qualitative data and obtain a picture \nof the way expectations and satisfaction were perceived by the managers who \nparticipated.  In turn, these findings can be used for more detailed investigation in \norder to develop propositions that can be tested to enable the exploration of \ndifferences in context to constants in process and outcome (Cavaye, 1996). \n \nThe company selected for this study was the Customer Services division of a large \nsubsidiary of a major transnational telecommunications organisation that had \ndeveloped and implemented a corporate wide HR Intranet.  The population studied \nconsisted of two categories: HR managers and HR customers.  The sample for both \ncategories consisted of individuals at middle and senior management levels and either \nreported to a Customer Services Board Director, or were one level removed from a \ndirectorial report.  HR participants were selected according to their support role as \ncustomer service managers as well as HR Intranet involvement, whilst HRM \ncustomers were randomly selected and invited to participate.  Seven HR managers and \nseven HR customers agreed to participate in this exploratory study. \n \nDATA COLLECTION METHOD \n \nStudy data drawn from a single organisation study (Yin, 1994) was used to provide \ndescriptive analysis (Kidder, 1982) and established consideration for subsequent \nexploratory inductive\/deductive interpretations of theory prepositions (Strauss and \nCorbin, 1998).  The data was gathered during late 2002 - early 2003, principally \nadopting semi-structured interviews.  Whilst their general protocol was determined in \nadvance, the questions were supplemented during each interview encounter in order to \nprobe emergent themes and to expand upon explanations (Harris and Sutton, 1986).  \nThe interviews were supported by extensive document compilation as well as \nobservation of the HR Intranet in operation in order to improve data triangulation \n(Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2002).  All interviews were conducted on a non-\nattributable, face to face basis. \n \nDATA ANALYSIS METHOD \n \nThe findings reported in this paper are drawn from an abstraction of the data using \nQSR NVIVO 1.1 software (Stutton and Callahan, 1987).  The data was analysed using \na qualitative analysis method of categorisation and sub-categorisation.  The majority \nof categories were identified from the literature, such as user involvement (Baroudi et \nal, 1986; Doll and Torkzadeh, 1989, McKeen et al, 1994).  Others not identified in the \nliterature were produced from primary data using a grounded approach (Glaser and \nStrauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998), highlighting specific uses of the HR Intranet \nby customers such as legal applications or specific outsourced HR issues. To improve \nreliability, participants checked their interview transcripts for accuracy, whilst, post \ninterview, two academic colleagues checked for congruence of results concerning the \ncoding of interview transcripts (Reason, 2000). \n \nFINDINGS \n \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n8 \nIn examining HR Intranet usage on internal customer satisfaction with the HR \nfunction, attention was given to HR customers\u2019 expectations, the changing role of \nmanagers, the nature of managers\u2019 satisfaction with HR Intranet design and \napplication and the HR function as well as participants\u2019 suggestions on how to \nimprove the service provided by HR particularly through the Intranet.  Perceptions of \nHR suppliers and HR customers concerning Intranet usage, expectations and elements \nof satisfaction with HR are presented in Table 1.  Considering that the study is \nqualitative and the sample too small to pursue statistical significance, the summary of \nresults in Table 1 below is presented as a form of data reduction for illustrative \npurposes.  The main themes and critical sub-themes (i.e. analytical categories) are \nexpanded upon, illustrated with selected quotes from interview, to highlight the \ncontextual dynamics between HR Intranet adoption and customer satisfaction with the \nHR function. \n \nTable 1: Summary of findings \nThemes\/Categories Positive \nresponse \n(%) \nNegative \nresponse  \n(%) \nNo clear \nopinion\/undecided \n(%) \nCustomer Expectations    \nHR Intranet meeting customer \nexpectations \n\u2022 HR Customers \n\u2022 HR Suppliers \n \n \n83 \n55 \n \n \n17 \n20 \n \n \n0 \n15 \nManagers\u2019 Satisfaction    \nManagers\u2019 satisfaction with HR \nIntranet \n\u2022 HR Customers \n\u2022 HR Suppliers \n \n \n83 \n100 \n \n \n17 \n0 \n \n \n0 \n0 \nThe Nature of Managers\u2019 Satisfaction    \nSatisfaction with HR Intranet Training \nto meet managers\u2019 changing role \n\u2022 HR Customers \n\u2022 HR Suppliers \n \n \n17 \n33 \n \n \n67 \n33 \n \n \n17 \n34 \nCustomers involved in planning HR \nIntranet \n\u2022 HR Customers \n\u2022 HR Suppliers \n \n \n0 \n50 \n \n \n100 \n50 \n \n \n0 \n0 \nSatisfaction with communication (e.g. \nMarketing of HR Intranet) \n\u2022 HR Customers \n\u2022 HR Suppliers \n \n \n17 \n50 \n \n \n83 \n33 \n \n \n0 \n17 \nHR feedback on HR Intranet (i.e. \nregarding quality of technology, quality \n   \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n9 \nof information and quality of service of \nHR Intranet applications) \n\u2022 HR Customers \n\u2022 HR Suppliers \n \n \n17 \n67 \n \n \n83 \n33 \n \n \n0 \n0 \nImpact of HR Intranet on HR \nFunction \n   \nHR Intranet satisfaction effect on HR \nFunction \n\u2022 HR Customers \n\u2022 HR Suppliers \n \n \n83 \n50 \n \n \n0 \n17 \n \n \n17 \n33 \nFuture Improvement of HR Intranet    \nImprove technical aspects of HR \nIntranet (e.g. reliability, functionality) \n\u2022 HR Customers \n\u2022 HR Suppliers \n \n \n60 \n70 \n \n \n15 \n20 \n \n \n25 \n10 \n \n \nHR Customer Expectations \n \nProbing into expectations and satisfaction found that when managers\u2019 expectations \nwith the HR Intranet were met, managers were satisfied both with overall HR Intranet \napplication and with the HR function.  The inverse was also found to exist.  Where \nexpectations of the HR Intranet were not achieved, this led to dissatisfaction with HR \nIntranet application in general and the HR function. \n \n\u2018I don\u2019t know what my expectations with HR were, but using their \nwebsite they deliver everything I need.\u2019 \n        HR Customer 4 \n \n\u2018General guidance is not specific nor sufficiently satisfactory \u2013 not \ncustomised enough or interactive to enable me to query the specifics of \nan issue\u2026  Gone through all the pages on sick absence but nothing on \nwhat the next stages are.\u2019 \n     HR Customer 3 \n \nConcerning customer expectations, a more negative view emerged from HR suppliers \nwho reported lower confidence in the HR Intranet meeting customer requirements. \n \n\u2018Don\u2019t know the benefits of it. See it as just another xyz of money spent \nby the HR function.\u2019 \nHR Supplier 2 \n \nManagers\u2019 Satisfaction \n \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n10\nSatisfaction with the HR Intranet usage was expressed by the majority of HR \ncustomers, which included HR managers themselves. \n \n\u2018Fact is that it\u2019s a prime source of information and because it\u2019s \navailable\u2026  I find out as much as possible before making the phone \ncall, then the phone call is of higher quality.\u2019 \nHR Customer 1 \n \n\u2018Very much, in particular dealing with industrial relations and \nmeeting with Unions as well as giving high level advice to the \nfunctional managers.  I use the HR Intranet a lot.\u2019 \nHR Supplier 5 \n \nNature of Managers\u2019 Satisfaction \n \nTwo noticeable findings centred on the nature of the managers\u2019 satisfaction, namely, \nthe perceived level of HR Intranet support for the changing role of managers, and \nmanagers involvement in the planning, marketing and feedback regarding quality of \ntechnology, quality of information and quality of service, of the HR Intranet \napplications.   \n \n1 Supporting the Changing Role of Managers \n \nThe roles of most of the managers in the study were reported as having changed \nsubstantially in response to developments in the company itself and to their own \ncustomers\u2019 expectations.  The extensive downsizing that had taken place meant a \nwider job related remit for many, higher productivity requirements and considerable \nstaffing variations.  Line managers reported that they had greater \u2018people type\u2019 \nresponsibilities largely due to the greater devolution of different HR activities.  As \nwell as the increased pressure this had brought, concerns were expressed over role \nambiguity and an increased need for HR support and training to enable managers to \nperform these new activities satisfactorily. \n \n\u2018Over the years a lot of things have come back to us. Not a bad idea but \nwe haven\u2019t been given the background support or training to enable us to \ndo it.\u2019 \nHR Customer 2 \n  \n'I can find things (on the HR Intranet) but usually after a long search. \nOne of the problems is a different document for different units - company \npolicy not HR\u2019s fault.\u2019 \nHR Customer 4 \n \n2 Managers\u2019 Involvement  \n \nParticipants\u2019 responses concerning quality of technology, quality of information and \nquality of service of the HR Intranet applications, found that satisfaction (or no \nsatisfaction) appeared to be considered only if one or more aspects were perceived to \nbe either particularly outstanding or poor.  On this basis, for some, satisfaction was \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n11\ndeclared only because there had been no negative experience to indicate otherwise.  \nThe most vivid responses, however, came from extremes of experience. \n \n\u2018To be honest I hadn\u2019t really thought about it\u2026  I suppose I\u2019m satisfied \nwith how accurate the information is (on the HR Intranet) \u2013 I haven\u2019t had \nanything which indicates it isn\u2019t.\u2019 \nHR Customer 6 \n \n'Overall, I\u2019m satisfied but nothing more. HR Intranet provides something \nthat wasn\u2019t there before.' \nHR Customer 5 \n \n'Good dissemination of info, but too much. Thing I like about it, good \ninformation about rules and regulations, good from that point of view.' \nHR Customer 1 \n \n'The problem with the Intranet is that the only relevant piece is the piece \nthey\u2019re looking for. Depends how far they have to wade through, even \nfinding a document, then need to find a paragraph. Mildly dissatisfied.' \nHR Supplier 4 \n \n'Yeah, fairly reliable. Satisfied. I suppose there\u2019s a trust there.' \nHR Customer 1 \n \n'I haven\u2019t found anything with a glaring error. Satisfied.' \nHR Customer 3 \n \nOther aspects emerged which confirmed the differing perceptions of service provision \nbetween the HR customer and supplier.  The responses brought to light a number of \nareas that could be grouped together as \u2018communication\u2019.  In contrast to the comments \nof overall satisfaction, customers indicated that, \n \n\u2022 no training had been given on the HR Intranet applications;  \n'Never had any. Totally dissatisfied. Might know how to use it if someone \nhad trained me.' \nHR Customer 7 \n \n\u2022 there had been little or no customer involvement in the adoption and \ndevelopment of the HR Intranet; \n'Customers were involved in some aspects but we then couldn\u2019t deliver \nbecause of funding problems. Got feedback about next stages of e-\nenablement but this folded because of the lack of funding.' \nHR Supplier 2 \n \n\u2022 HR had not asked customers for any feedback on their usage or satisfaction with \nthe Intranet;  \n'Not a bad idea to have your opinion heard but haven\u2019t been given the \nbackground support or interest to enable us to do it.' \nHR Customer 4 \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n12\n \n\u2022 marketing of the HR Intranet had either been non-existent or poor; \n'Well, I think it could be one area where they have sold themselves short. \nMore people would use it, if properly communicated about what was on \nit.' \nHR Customer 6 \n \n\u2022 no customisation of the Intranet for different groups or individuals; \n'No, there\u2019s not anything that comes to mind that\u2019s tailored to my needs. \nBut if I knew it was available I\u2019d use it.' \nHR Customer 1 \n \n\u2022 no alternative provision of information allowing opting out of the HR Intranet \nsystem; \n \n'HR does not any longer provide hard copy of HR manuals and if one \nrings and asks them a question, instead of receiving the requested \ninformation, one gets a reply that the information is on the Net.  Use of \nthe Net is forced on managers, irrelevant of individuals\u2019 preferred \nworking style. Non-technophiles are marginalized.\u2019 \nHR Customer 3 \n \nIn contrast, the HR Managers interviewed generally felt that the above aspects had \nbeen adequately covered. \n \n\u2018We did loads\u2026  can\u2019t recall all the detail but internal newspapers, \nspecific e-mail drops to target communities, Web news bulletins.\u2019 \nHR Supplier 2 \n \nThe more positively oriented assumptions made by HR managers concerning HR \nIntranet communication and service provision, were reported as evident to HR\u2019s \ninternal customers. \n \n\u2018I think that if HR has missed a trick, it\u2019s probably this - HR can be a \nsource of information. Ring and ask them and they say it\u2019s on the Net. \nThey just assume everyone\u2019s happy about going to the Net but they \nhaven\u2019t positioned themselves to show this as a positive aspect of their \nrole.\u2019 \nHR Customer 1 \n \nHR Intranet Impact on the HR Function \n \nA minority opinion held by customer managers considered HR as offering a \u2018hygiene \nfactor\u2019 service, for example, being concerned that salaries are paid on time.  \nSeemingly sensitive to such a view, HR managers perceived both the expectations of \ntheir customers concerning HR\u2019s use of the Intranet to provide HR services, and the \nresulting customer satisfaction, as being low. \n \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n13\nIn contrast, the majority of customers felt that their (high) expectations were met and \nthey increasingly thought that their relationship with HR had improved and, as a \nresult, indicated they were satisfied with HR\u2019s contribution. \n \n\u2018I would say that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s had a derogatory effect on HR. I think \nit\u2019s changed it but not for the worse.\u2019 \nHR Supplier 2 \n \n\u2018All the dealings I\u2019ve had with HR, directly and through the Intranet, \nhave been excellent. More so recently. My job\u2019s evolved and I\u2019m looking \nfor more from HR. Very supportive, straight and tell it directly.\u2019 \n HR Customer 1 \n \n\u2018We work very closely with an immediate HR colleague\u2026  Before the HR \nIntranet, I would never have thought about them, now more available and \nmanagers more focused on help they can give.\u2019 \nHR Customer 7 \n \nImproving the HR Intranet \n \nDespite the fact that the majority of managers indicated they were generally satisfied \nwith the HR Intranet, each one, when questioned, raised issues with one or more \naspects of the Intranet and made suggestions for improvement.  Although it was \nestablished that HR had not sought their opinions concerning the HR Intranet, neither \nhad any manager volunteered information to the HR department.  The suggestions \nrelated mainly to important facets of the line manager\u2019s own role and interests and \nincluded a spectrum of activities still wholly or partly being carried out manually as \nwell as improvements to aspects fully provided through the Internet. \n \n'I think it\u2019s got to work and be reliable. More systems testing and \ninvolvement before launch. Failure \u2026.. will mean more cynicism for the \nnext project. Have to make sure it\u2019s fit for the purpose\u2026..\u2019 \nHR Supplier 5 \n \n'Haven\u2019t thought about them. Maybe a number of flow charts for generic \naspects, e.g. late for work, etc.' \nHR Customer 3 \n \nDISCUSSION \n \nThe dynamic nature of organisational relationships is recognised in the literature as \nhaving a profound impact on task and organisational outcomes due to the continual \nand ever evolving interaction between differing parties (Fondas and Stewart, 1994).  \nExamination in this study of the changing managerial role and its relationship with the \nHR function highlights the effect of managers\u2019 expectations of HR through the use of \nIntranet technology to provide HR services.  Managers\u2019 satisfaction with the HR \nIntranet is shown to influence their view of the HR function.  Thus, managers who felt \ntheir expectations were met were satisfied with the HR Intranet and said that its use \nhad either increased their satisfaction with the HR function or had no effect on their \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n14\noriginal perspective.  Conversely, the manager whose expectations had not been met \nexpressed dissatisfaction with the HR Intranet and felt that it decreased his \nsatisfaction with the HR function.  In the marketing literature this \nconfirmation\/disconfirmation of expectations has been identified as a key variable \naffecting customer satisfaction (Yi, 1990), which has not been sufficiently applied to \nthe HR field in respect of its provision of services using new technology. \n \nManagers\u2019 expectations were found to be influenced by different factors.  Devolution \nof HR activities along with company downsizing and restructuring, which had \nexpanded their role, meant that their expectations of HR had changed and, in turn, \nreflected their different priorities.  Consequently, individual activities assumed greater \nor lesser importance in determining expectations and strengthened the perception of \nsatisfaction or dissatisfaction.  The challenge for HR is to adopt a proactive \n\u2018technology push\u2019 stance and to develop flexible systems which are customised and \ninteractive despite the fact that customers may not, as yet, realise the benefits of such \ncapabilities. \n \nThe study results revealed that even customers who were overall satisfied with the HR \nIntranet, held concerns with specific aspects of the service and, when asked, 11 out of \n14 of the managers contributed suggestions for improvements.  HR customers \nidentified many areas where communication was lacking, a finding supported by other \nHR studies which highlight communication as key (Bruce, 1997).  According to the \nsurvey participants, user involvement (in HR intranet development and applications \ntesting), highlighted by many researchers as important to satisfaction, did not take \nplace (Baroudi et al., 1986; Doll and Torkzadeh, 1989; McKeen et al., 1994).  This \naspect should be investigated further. \n \nSimilarly, both customers and HR managers identified that no training had been given \non the Intranet, but rather there was an HR expectation of user trial and error.  Again, \nthe literature identifies the importance of IT training (Cragg and King, 1993), an area \nthat HR appears to have missed as a valuable opportunity for communicating with \nusers.  Other areas where communication was lacking included the perception by the \ncustomers of little, if any, marketing either to \u2018sell\u2019 the services and enhance the role \ncapabilities of managers, or to keep them fully informed about developments and \nplans for the HR Intranet.  In view of the admission of no segmentation of customers\u2019 \nneeds or any customisation, there appear to be considerable opportunities to improve \nuser satisfaction. Further, the low confidence of HR managers that HR customers\u2019 \nIntranet expectations were not being met appear to arise due to lack of sufficient \nfeedback, a finding which prompts an additional area for further investigation. \n \nThe findings reveal that many aspects identified as satisfactory only appeared to be so \nbecause managers had not experienced any negative factors.  It is not unreasonable to \nassume that it may only require one item to go wrong to change an individual\u2019s \nperception of satisfaction.  The degree and underlying strength of satisfaction should \nbe investigated further. \n \nCustomers also maintained that, except for one individual at local level, HR failed to \nrequest feedback on use\/satisfaction with the system, a factor considerably recognised \nin the literature as necessary for HR to improve its customer orientation (Mabey et al., \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n15\n1998), commit to internal customer satisfaction (Bowen and Greiner, 1986) and listen \nto \u201ckeep HRM saturated with information on internal customers\u2019 perceptions and \nexpectations\u201d (Bowen, 1996: 35).  In reality, there are many aspects of \ncommunication (training, involvement, feedback, marketing, as well as managing \nexpectations) where opportunities for two-way customer\/supplier dialogue can be \nneglected.  Although the literature strongly suggests that these various aspects are \nimportant to customer satisfaction (Bacon, 1999), the findings from this exploratory \nstudy were mixed, highlighting additional questions that need to be further explored.  \nOn this basis, the following questions are identified as worthy of further examination. \n \n\u2022 Where human resource Intranet application (HRIA) training is provided and \nperceived by managers as satisfactory, will this increase managerial satisfaction \nwith the HR function? \n \n\u2022 Where customer involvement in the adoption\/development of the HRIA is \nperceived by managers to be satisfactory, will this increase managerial \nsatisfaction with the HR function? \n \n\u2022 Where the opportunities for customer feedback about the use of the HRIA and \nappropriate action taken is perceived by managers to be satisfactory, will this \nincrease managerial satisfaction with the HR function? \n \n\u2022 Where the internal marketing of the HRIA is perceived by managers to be \nsatisfactory, will this increase managerial satisfaction with the HR function? \n \nSTUDY LIMITATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS \n \nInformation and communication technology (ICT) is posited in the literature as a key \nfactor to have a profound effect on the HR function but, to date, there has been \nminimal theoretical development and empirical research undertaken in this area. \nWhere studies have been carried out, it is usually from the perspective of HR ICT \nproficiency.  The study reported in this paper attempts to be ground breaking through \ninvestigating multiple perceptions of an ICT support tool, a focus that has been \nidentified as an area lacking in the HR arena (McGovern et al, 1997; Kettinger and \nLee, 1994).  Through providing understanding of the expectations and perceptions of \nHR customers, the study also offers insight on how the use of the HR Intranet can \nimpact on managers' satisfaction with the HR function. Emphasised is that, in \ninstalling and developing technology, customers\u2019 expectations and priorities \nconcerning type and quality of service need to be taken into account. \n \nDespite identifying opportunities for further research, this exploratory study has its \nlimitations.  Because of its exploratory nature, this inquiry did not examine issues of \nindividual style or personal orientation (extroversion\/introversion; \noptimism\/pessimism) impact on HR customer expectations and satisfaction.  Equally, \nthe nature of previous customer experience(s) with the HR function was only \nremarked upon and more research is needed in order to determine specific causal \nlinkages.  As this study investigated expectations and satisfaction at the managerial \nlevel, exploration of the HR customer relationship also needs to be pursued at the \nstrategic, operative and supervisory levels in order to identify similarities and \n V9 18 Jan 06 \n16\ndifferences in patterns of responses.  Additionally, the single case approach limits \nfindings, possibly to the point of being unique to the enterprise under scrutiny, thus \nemphasising even more the need for a broader survey in order to emerge with greater \ngeneralisability of findings. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nOverall, the findings emphasise that the influence of customers\u2019 increased \nexpectations impacts on the changing role of HR (Conner and Ulrich, 1996) and the \ninfluence that the use of Intranet technology for HR applications has an effect on the \nperceived satisfaction with the HR function (Huselid and Becker, 1999).  Emphasised \nare the possibilities that effective and proactive use of IT can have on HR (Snell et al, \n1995; Groe et al, 1996).  On this basis, this study is a first step towards understanding \nthe dynamic nature of the HR customer\/supplier role relationship and the impact that \nthe use of new technology can have on this relationship.  It is postulated that these \nresults are useful in setting an agenda for future research. \n \nReferences \nAlleyne, C.
