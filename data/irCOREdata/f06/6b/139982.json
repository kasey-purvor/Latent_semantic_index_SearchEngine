The \nhoneycomb core, composed of impregnated Nomex paper, shows excellent specific transverse \ncompression and shear behaviour. However, hull structures are also subjected to so-called \u201cslamming\u201d \nloads caused by repeated water impacts. Several studies have described this phenomenon [1-3], which \ninvolves a localized pressure pulse travelling over a limited area of the hull. This can seriously damage \nsandwich structures, and is usually taken into account in design as an equivalent pressure [4]. \nHowever, there is considerable uncertainty over the safety factors required for this loading despite \nseveral measurement campaigns for different vessels (e.g.  [5-7]). The slamming pulse is very short, \ntypically lasting tens of milli-seconds, so special equipment is needed to record it and to correlate the \nrecording with navigation conditions. \nTwo questions have been addressed in the present study; first, how can slamming impact be \nsimulated in the laboratory, to enable new material combinations to be evaluated, and second,  what \nare the material parameters which determine slamming resistance ? In the recent ISO procedure for \ndimensioning hull structures [4] a full size impact test is suggested to validate new designs. Such tests \nhave been performed (e.g.  [8]) but this is clearly a very expensive option. An intermediate alternative \nis to work on boat sections, and this approach has been used with drop tests to examine how pressure \nvaries during a water impact on composite sandwich structures [9]. Small scale models have also been \nused in drop tests to obtain slamming pressure data [10], while a recent study used panels \ninstrumented with Bragg gratings dropped into a wave tank [11]. At the laboratory scale various \nstudies of rate effects on small core and sandwich coupons have been reported [12-15]. These provide \nuseful input data for modelling but do not allow the influence of structural parameters such as panel \nthickness to be evaluated. Several other studies have focussed on rigid impacter loading of honeycomb \nsandwich materials (e.g. [16-18]) but a local indentation response is difficult to relate to the water \nimpact of interest here. Furthermore, the damage induced in rigid impacter tests on honeycomb \nsandwich cannot be assumed to be independent of loading rate [16]. Finally, a very recent paper \ndescribes a test set-up specifically designed to examine controlled velocity impacts of panels on water, \nbut this requires a complex dedicated test machine [19]. Various tests have been used at Ifremer to \ncharacterize impact behaviour of sandwich materials and a test involving dropping a weighted \nmedicine ball on panels, from increasing heights, has been shown to simulate the type of damage \nfound in practice [20]. For racing yachts the common use of very thin carbon composite skins \n(typically less than 1 mm thick) on lightweight honeycomb cores makes the structures susceptible to \ndamage which appears as permanent core crushing. Medicine ball testing produces exactly this \ndamage, Figure 1. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 3  \n \n \nGiven the existence of a suitable test, the nature of the damage observed after slamming impacts \nmakes it useful to examine the many material parameters which may affect impact crushing resistance \n(core density, cell size, panel thickness\u2026), and in particular to establish whether alternative core \nmaterials might offer improved performance for these structures. One option is a new type of pinned \nfoam core, which comprises angled carbon pins in a foam core bonded to sandwich facings, and which \ncan provide weight gains based on its quasi-static properties. These cores and an alternative in which \nthe pins go through the facing composite, have been developed commercially recently for racing car \nand aerospace structures [21]  see Figure 2. Fracture surfaces from out-of-plane tensile tests on pinned \nfoam and on honeycomb sandwich panels are shown in Figure 3. It is clear that this form of core is \ncompletely different from the traditional honeycomb configuration and must be characterized in detail \nif its use is to be optimized.  \n \nMarasco and colleagues have studied these materials in detail [22,23] , and Carti\u00e9 and Fleck looked at \nrate effects [24] but few other data have been published to date to enable impact behaviour of pinned \ncores to be compared to that of honeycomb cores [25,26]. A principal aim of the current study was to \nmake this comparison for panels subjected to a \u201csoft\u201d impact.  \n \nFinally, in order to optimise the design of sandwich structures and to avoid extensive large scale \ntesting it is important to develop models which will allow parametric studies to be performed. This is \nan ongoing part of the present project, which will be presented later, but another reason for performing \nan instrumented series of tests such as those described below was to help to validate these models. \n \nMaterials \nThe sandwich materials which will be described here are of three types, Table 1 : \n \n- Nomex honeycomb cores, with different densities from 48 to 96 kg\/m3. The basic core density \nstudied is 64 kg\/m3, with hexagonal 5mm cells, but other densities and forms were tested in \nthe preliminary study to examine the influence of these parameters. Two forms of cell were \nexamined, OX (over expanded) in the preliminary study, and hexagonal for the quasi-static \nand instrumented impact tests. \n- Polyimide foam, from Rohacell, with density 31 kg\/m3  \n- Pinned foam, the same polyimide foam reinforced in the through-thickness direction with \npultruded carbon fibre reinforced pins of 0.51mm diameter in four directions at +\/-30\u00b0 to a \nnormal to the facings (Figure 2). This resulted in an overall density of 64 kg\/ m3. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 4  \nAll samples were supplied in the form of one metre square sandwich panels. The honeycomb \nsandwich materials were produced from Structil high strength carbon fibre R367-2 prepreg by curing \nin three steps, first one skin made up of two layers at \u00b145\u00b0, then the honeycomb core was bonded to \nthis using 300g\/m\u00b2 ST1035 film adhesive, then a second film layer and the second (+\/-45\u00b0)2 skin with \nmirror symmetry compared to the first. Cure conditions at each step were 100\u00b0C  for 4 hours and 0.9 \nbar vacuum. \nThe foam and pinned reinforced foam panels were manufactured at Cranfield University. The 12mm \nthick pin reinforced foam cores were manufactured inserting partially cured T650\/epoxy carbon fibre \nrods using a 6 axis Kawasaki robot equipped with a dedicated insertion head, taking care to leave 5mm \nlengths protruding from the foam.  The protruding lengths were then bent and splayed out by pressing \nflat onto the surface of the cores using a hot press at 180\u00b0C.  The press was left to cool down slowly to \nroom temperature, thus finishing the cure of the rods in the final shape.  A 200 g\/m\u00b2 SA80 adhesive \nfilm was used between the cores and the skins.  Each face sheet was made of two (\u00b145\u00b0) carbon\/epoxy \nSE70 prepreg layers of 300 g\/m\u00b2 supplied by Gurit.  The completed panels were cured at 120\u00b0C for \ntwo hours.  The edges of the panels were reinforced with additional carbon\/epoxy layers to avoid \ndamage from the steel frame. \n \nTest procedures \nQuasi-static mechanical properties \nThe quasi-static properties of the three types of sandwich were evaluated in compression (ASTM \nC365 on 50 x 50mm\u00b2 samples), tension (ASTM C297 on 50 x 50mm\u00b2 samples bonded to steel blocks), \nshear (ASTM C273 on 250 x 50mm\u00b2 samples with compression loading of samples bonded to steel \nrails). Three to five specimens were tested for each value. All tests were performed at a loading rate of \n1mm\/minute.  \nSoft impact \nA drop weight set-up was employed to study the impact response of one metre square sandwich \npanels. A preliminary series of tests was performed without instrumentation, followed by a series with \nfull instrumentation. \nBoundary conditions \nThe test set-up is shown in Figure 4. The panel is rigidly clamped by 36 bolts using a torque wrench \ninside a two-part steel picture frame, which is in turn bolted to four load cells bolted between the \nframe corners and the ends of two rigid IPN bars. The \u00b145\u00b0 facing fibres are aligned with the frame \ndiagonal directions. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 5  \nLoading \nThe panel is loaded by dropping a weighted elastomeric medicine ball from increasing heights until \nfailure is detected visually.  Two medicine balls of different weights were used. The first weighed 18.8 \nkg and was filled with sand, the second 26.3 kg and filled with steel particles. They were weighed \nbefore and after testing. Initial ball diameter is 280 mm. The ball wall thickness is 10 mm. \nInstrumentation \nThe measurements made during these tests were: \n- Impact loads, recorded by four load cells fixed between the corners of the test frame and the \nsupporting IPNs. Their calibration was checked on a static test frame after testing. Values \npresented here are the sum of the four load cell values. \n- Central panel displacement, measured by a laser displacement transducer placed on a support \non the floor below the panel.  \n- Test frame displacement, measured at the frame mid-span by a second laser displacement \ntransducer fixed to the floor.

A Keithley data acquisition card linked to a PC \nand in-house software recorded the output from the two laser transducers and the three strain gauges. \nA Catman acquisition system also recorded the central laser signal, so that data from the acquisition \nsystems could be co-ordinated, together with the four load cell signals. Both recorded at a rate of 10 \nkHz. Images from the high speed camera were recorded on a third PC at 2000 images per second. All \ndata were stored for subsequent analysis. \n \nResults and Discussion \nQuasi-static tests \nThe three materials were first characterized using standard quasi-static test procedures. Figure 5 shows \nan example of force-strain plots in compression; a comparison of the measured strengths of the three \nmaterials under compression, shear and tensile loading in standard tests is presented in Figure 6. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 6  \nThe quasi-static strength of the reference 64 kg\/m3 honeycomb core is higher than that of the pinned \nfoam under both out-of-plane compression and shear loading. However, the through thickness tensile \nstrength of the pinned foam is higher. The unreinforced foam properties are considerably lower than \nthose of the two other sandwich materials but the density is also over 50% lower, so the comparison is \nnot strictly valid. \n \nSoft impact tests \nTwo series of tests were performed. The first was a preliminary series without instrumentation on \nsandwich panels with different variants of the core and geometry. The second, with the extensive \ninstrumentation described above, provided a direct comparison between the basic 64 kg\/m3 \nhoneycomb panel and the foam with and without pins.  \nPreliminary impact tests on honeycomb sandwich \n \nTwo examples from the preliminary tests, shown in Figure 7, enable the influence of sandwich \nthickness and density to be examined. The damage energy is the energy at which damage was \nobserved, defined simply as E=mgh, with m the mass of the impacter in kg, g=9.81 m\/s\u00b2 and h the \ndrop height in metres. \n \nThinner cores may provide improved impact performance due to improved deflection resulting in \nhigher stored energy, Figure 7a. Increasing density can improve the energy absorbed before damage is \nobserved, as resistance to local crushing is improved, but there may be a plateau to this improvement \nas higher flexural rigidity results in lower deflection, Figure 7b. It should be noted that the thicker \nsandwich panels did not show the same damage mechanism as thin panels. For the latter core crushing \nwas apparent, while thicker panels also showed skin\/core delamination. Nevertheless the medicine ball \ntest appears to be sensitive to material differences, therefore a more detailed series of tests was \nperformed.  \nInstrumented test series \n \nFour fully instrumented panels were tested, two honeycomb, one pinned foam core and one \nunreinforced core sandwich. Panels were loaded at drop height increments of one meter. In order to \nexamine repeatability the two metre drop height test was repeated three times on each honeycomb \npanel. Table 2 shows the results, indicating good repeatability for energies below first damage.  Figure \n8 summarizes the tests performed on the three materials.  \nFigure 9 shows the damage incurred. The first damage of the standard (64 kg\/m3) material was noted \nvisually after a drop from 3 metres, and sectioning revealed this to be permanent crushing of the core \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 7  \n(Figure 9a). Visual damage of this type on a racing yacht would be repaired. No skin debonding was \nnoted. A second identical panel was then tested to confirm this result and again first damage was noted \nat 3 metres. Tests were continued on this second panel up to final complete failure, which occurred at \naround 1.3 kJ. \nThe unreinforced polyimide core failed completely after an impact from one metre height, sectioning \nrevealed core crushing and lower skin debonding in the core near the adhesive layer (Figure 9b). The \npinned reinforced foam core was tested to a drop height of 6 metres with the 18.8 kg ball without any \nobservable damage, then up to 5 metres with the 26.2 kg ball before final failure. This involved skin \nrupture with cracks following the 45\u00b0 fibres and along the frame edge as shown in Figure 9c. \nSectioning of the central zone revealed no thickness change nor other indications of damage. \nFigure 10 shows an example of the load and central displacement recordings for the honeycomb and \npinned foam panel tests with 1 meter drops. The recordings are very similar for the two panels, \nsuggesting that the difference in core does not affect the elastic behaviour of the structure. The impact \nduration is around 25 milliseconds in both cases.  \nFigure 11 presents the maximum loads and displacements recorded during the instrumented test series. \nThese indicate that for the pinned foam the force and displacement increase fairly linearly up to final \nfailure. For the honeycomb, the displacements are very similar initially but beyond the energy required \nfor core crushing there is a break in the plots of both force and displacement, suggesting that the \ndamage introduced has modified the response of the structure. \nThe force increases linearly with the impact energy, and hence with the drop height, but the \ndeformable nature of the impacter means that the contact area may also change as drop height \nincreases. The high speed camera enables the shape of the medicine ball to be observed during impact, \nand provides a qualitative indication of the contact zone. Pressure sensitive paper, which changes \ncolour from white to red when pressure exceeds a threshold, has also been used to estimate the contact \narea. Paper with a very low threshold ( FujiFilm Ultra Super Low pressure film, threshold  0.2 MPa) \nwas used. Figure 12 shows results from 11 tests on a range of undamaged panel materials including \nsandwich and monolithic materials, indicating that the contact area increases with impact height by \nabout 10% per metre increase in drop height. However, this increase is quite small compared to the \nincrease in measured force (Figure 11a), which is over 25% per metre increase, so the average \npressure applied to the panel increases significantly with drop height. \nThe impact behaviour of composite plates depends on the duration of the event. Olsson has suggested \na criterion to determine whether an impact can be considered as quasi-static, i.e. whether the impact is \nmuch longer than the time necessary for waves to reach the plate boundaries so the lowest vibration \nmode predominates [27]. The large impacter mass (18.8 kg) compared to the panel mass (3.6 kg) \nsatisfies the M\/Mp>2 criterion to suggest a quasi-static response, where Mp is the total plate mass. \nHigh speed photography enabled a natural vibration frequency of around 100 Hz to be measured for \nthe honeycomb and pinned foam panels. \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n 8  \nThe impact resistance of the pinned foam is significantly better than that of the honeycomb of \nequivalent density even though the quasi-static compression stress corresponding to permanent \ncrushing of the latter is significantly higher. This result is very important, as the standardized \ncompression and shear tests are generally used to classify materials for these applications. Also, if a \nproblem is noted with a honeycomb cored panel in a critical area the response is usually to specify a \nhigher density core there in order to increase the crush and shear strengths. The results shown here, \nboth in the preliminary tests (Figure 7) and in the instrumented series, clearly indicate that this \napproach may not be appropriate. Changing to another core type, such as foam with through thickness \npins, may be much more effective. While the global response of the panel may be quasi-static this \ndoes not mean that dynamic effects on yield and damage locally can be ignored. Indeed, given that the \nquasi-static compression properties do not correlate with the observed impact behaviour, this suggests \nthat it is the rate dependence of the properties of these two types of core which differs, and that the \npinned foam properties improve at high rates. Indeed, previous work by Carti\u00e9 & Fleck [24] has \nshown that compressive yield strength increased substantially for a lighter (31 kg\/m3) pinned foam \ncore  loaded at 10 m\/s, almost double compared to quasi-static values. This was attributed to micro-\ninertia of the pins. Recent work on 48 kg\/m3 Nomex honeycomb has shown a much smaller increase in \ncrush strength at high rates [15], possibly explaining the significantly better resistance of the pinned \nfoam to impact damage. Further work is needed to explore this difference.   \nConclusions \nThese tests clearly indicate that sandwich material with through-thickness pins offers great potential \nfor improving the performance of structures subjected to water impact. A twofold increase in damage \nthreshold under soft impact loading conditions was noted. The results from quasi-static compression \ntests alone do not provide a useful guide to slamming impact performance. The pin configuration \ntested here, based on one combination of pin angle, pin diameter and pin spacing, is probably not \noptimised and further improvements may be possible with other configurations.  These results are now \nbeing used to validate a numerical model of impact response, in order to create of a tool to allow \nimproved design of sandwich materials for these applications. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors wish to thank Gurit for the supply of facing materials for the foam and pinned reinforced \nfoam cores part of this project.
