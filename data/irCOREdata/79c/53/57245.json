Key issues\nare identified and possible ways to overcome or ameliorate\nthese problems are suggested.\n1 Introduction\nSoftware research projects naturally involve significant\nsoftware development and thus experience many of the\nproblems encountered by industrial software development.\nThe uncertain nature of research compounds these prob-\nlems and introduce others including short timescales (1\u20133\nyears), high staff turnover, chaotic development practices,\nand changing research goals. The Open Source Component\nArtefact Repository (OSCAR) is the result of development\nundertaken in a two-year research project (GENESIS) in-\nvolving academic and industrial partners. GENESIS gave\nrise to a number of these problems.\n2 Experiences\nFailings ocurred in all phases of the development of\nOSCAR, particularly in collaboration between consortium\npartners [1]. Firstly requirements failings ocurred, primar-\nily over-ambition; the research goals of OSCAR and the\nindustrial partners\u2019 requirements were difficult to achieve\nand evaluate successfully in a short timescale. These am-\nbitious requirements resulted in too many features in the\ninitial design. Many of these features were unnecessary for\na proof-of-concept prototype and not required by partners.\nSecondly, a lack of agreement on core technology ham-\npered the project. In OSCAR\u2019s case, an initially promis-\ning database (PostgreSQL on Linux) caused problems when\nOSCAR was deployed on Windows. The maintenance cost\nto solve these problems was significant. The fact that the\nconsortium was using two different development environ-\nments (Linux and Windows) initially hid these problems.\nA lack of communication, particularly between partners,\ncaused problems. Attempts to integrate OSCAR with other\nGENESIS components or re-use it in other projects were\nhampered by lack of user support. However, communica-\ntion needs to be bi-directional; research developers using\nOSCAR often failed to supply informative bug reports.\nFinally, disseminating the work beyond papers is impor-\ntant. Developing an information pack on CD containing\nthe current software, papers and any flyers to distribute at\nconferences and industrial gatherings is a good strategy that\nshould not be confined to the closing stages of the project.\nThis would foster wider participation as well as aiding in-\nternal collaboration.\n3 Conclusion\nEarly agreement on issues such as collaboration and\ncommunication support, common platforms, component se-\nlection, tool support and the research\/development tradeoff\nis important. During planning, effective risk management\nincluding contingency planning and expectation manage-\nment is vital. Maintaining a balance between the research\ngoals of the project and the needs of the industrial partners\nis difficult. In our case, due to our funding conditions, the\ncorrect decision was to solve the partner\u2019s problems first.\nWhile problems within a small research team can be readily\nrecognised and addressed, collaboration support, especially\ncommunication of work status, between teams is vital for\nan effective distributed software research and development\nproject.\nReferences\n[1] D.
