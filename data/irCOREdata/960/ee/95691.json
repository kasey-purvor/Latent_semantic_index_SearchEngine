INTRODUCTION\nAlgorithmic aspects of wireless mesh networks (WMNs)\nare currently a vigorous area of research and have steadily\naccumulated momentum over the last few years. The lead-\ning exponents of this increased interest are the potential\nmultifarious applications of WMNs [1]. Admittedly, the two\nmost important of them are provision of low-cost and rapid-\ndeployable broadband last mile connectivity to the Internet\nor backhaul support for 3G cells and IEEE 802.11\u201cx\u201d hot\nspots.\nEfficient resource utilization in WMNs calls for schedul-\ning and routing policies that maximize the aggregate\nthroughput of the system. Under this perspective, the central\ntheme of this paper is the design of joint scheduling and\nshortest-path spanning tree schemes that provide increased\nsystem performance. With a preconstructed spanning tree\nwithin the mesh network, the cornerstone aim of the\nscheduling engine is either to maximize the transmission\nopportunities of active links in a specific time window (frame\nlength) by taking into account the interference caused by\nsimultaneously transmitting nodes or to minimize the time\nspan for all links to transmit, that is, minimize frame length.\nConcurrent transmissions are of utmost importance since\nthey increase system efficiency but can lead to erroneous\nreception at the receiver if the level of the received signal\nis too weak compared to the aggregate interference. Thus,\nthe spatial reuse of timeslots heavily depends on the selected\nactive set of links in the mesh topology; but, the active set\nof links is constructed by the routing algorithm. Therefore,\nand as it will become vividly clear in the sequel, there\nis an interplay between scheduling and routing decisions.\nThe rationale of designing joint routing and scheduling\nschemes stems exactly from this interplay between the two\nfunctionalities.\nThe medium-access control scheme considered hereafter\nis based on time division multiple access (TDMA), where\ntime is divided into timeslots and each node can transmit\nonly at predefined timeslots, thus, collisions can be avoided\n(the same analysis can also be applied for FDMA-based\nnetworks). Since nodes are spatially distributed, timeslots\ncan be potentially reused by nodes that are sufficiently far\n2 EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking\napart. Spatial reusing of timeslots has been defined in the\nseminal work of Nelson and Kleinrock [2] and is called\nspatial TDMA (STDMA).\nIn this paper, we focus on utilizing shortest-path algo-\nrithms, which are widely studied and used in practise. The\nemphasis is on Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm which for bounded\ndegree graphs finds the shortest paths from a source node\nto every other node in O(n logn) time, where n is the\nnumber of nodes in the network. The cost metric used is the\nrequired transmission power for a link (i, j) to be established.\nWe focus on rooted spanning tree construction (for both\nuplink and downlink) since the mesh mode specifications\nthat have been integrated into the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard\nare based on tree topology. Our proposed pruning schemes\nrun Dijkstra iteratively, and at each iteration, eliminate\n(prune) links that produce high interference; the resulting\ntree\u2019s scheduling performance is evaluated by using optimal\nscheduling or a greedy scheduling heuristic and the tree with\nthe best scheduling performance is kept. Thus, scheduling\ninformation is incorporated in making decisions about\nrouting.\nWe compare the proposed pruning algorithm with other\nDijkstra-based schemes. These heuristics use as costs linear\ncombinations of the required power for transmission and\nthe interference produced. We show that proposed pruning\nalgorithm outperforms these heuristics.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In\nSection 2, selected closely related previous works in the area\nof joint routing and scheduling are outlined. The problem\ndescription and the mixed-integer linear program (MILP)\nformulation are detailed in Section 3. The inherent interplay\nbetween routing and scheduling is explained in Section 4. In\nSection 5, suboptimal joint scheduling and routing schemes\nare explained; and Section 6 outlines the two flavors of\nthe proposed pruning algorithm. Numerical investigations\nare reported in Section 7; and finally, Section 8 concludes\nthe paper by outlining the main findings followed by brief\nremarks on future avenues for research.\n2. REVIEWOF SELECTED PRIORWORKS\nAfter the introduction of the spatial TDMA concept by\nNelson and Kleinrock in [2], general timeslot (or channel)\nassignment scheduling problems have been extensively stud-\nied in the literature. The bulk of previous research work\nfocused on graph theoretic solutions by conceiving link\nscheduling as a graph-coloring problem [3\u20135]. In the basic\nsetting, graph-coloring approaches aim to tackle the primary\nand secondary conflicts between links. More specifically, any\npair of directed edges (a, b), (c,d) may be colored with\nthe same color if and only if (i) a, b, c,d are all mutually\ndistinct and (ii) edges (a,d), (c, b) do not belong in the set\nof edges in the graph. When the first (second) condition fails\nto hold, then there will be a primary (secondary) conflict\nbetween edges (a, b) and (c,d). Scheduling based on graph\ntheoretic tools proved essential for formally defining the\nproblem and for the design of distributed solutions. The\nlimitations on the other hand of these solutions stem from\nthe fact that the aggregate effect of interference of links\ntransmitting in concurrent timeslots (reflected in the signal-\nto-interference noise ratio (SINR)) is not taken explicitly into\naccount [6]. Hence, a schedule provided by a graph-coloring\ntechnique may lead to an infeasible allocation when the SINR\nthresholds are taken into account. Related to this last point\nis the observation that an optimal schedule based on graph\ncoloring can be considered as a lower bound of the minimum\nnumber of timeslots that can be used in the network.\nTo fill this void, the authors in [7] have explicitly taken\ninto account the SINR thresholds together with power\ncontrol for constructing minimum frame length scheduling\nin STDMA networks with directional antennas. From a\ncomputational complexity perspective, even without taking\ninto account the aggregate interference, constructing a trans-\nmission schedule of timeslots where all links are scheduled\nwith the minimum number of timeslots (i.e., minimum\nframe length) has shown to be an N P -complete problem\n[8].\nThe work of Tassiulas and Ephremides [9] showed that\nthe capacity region of wireless multihop networks depends\non the power allocation vector (which itself depends on\nchannel conditions) as well as the routing and scheduling\ndecisions. This formal characterization of the inherent\ncoupling between power control, scheduling, and routing,\nsparked a research interest in schemes that attempt to\noptimize them jointly [10, 11]. These so-called cross-layer\noptimization approaches have recently been extended to\ntake into account end-to-end flow and congestion control\ndecisions (transport layer) [12]. Polynomial complexity\nalgorithms together with necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor optimal scheduling and routing of a predefined set\nof source-destination rates in mesh networks have been\ndiscussed in [13]. In contrast to these previous works, the\nemphasis in this paper is on how to construct spanning\ntrees that minimize the frame length (in terms of required\ntimeslots) in the mesh network.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that pruning techniques\nhave been mainly used within quality of service (QoS)\nrouting to produce a sparser graph, consisting entirely of\nfeasible links [14, 15]. In these QoS routing schemes, links\nare deleted from the topology if their available resources\ndo not meet the corresponding constraints. In our case,\nthe incentive for link pruning is a rather different one;\npruning is used to delete links that produce high interference\nto neighbor nodes that can lead to low-spatial reuse of\ntimeslots.\n2.1. Contribution of the paper\nTo the authors best knowledge, this is the first paper that\nexplicitly addresses the issue of how to jointly construct a\nspanning tree while minimizing the required frame length\n(in terms of the number of timeslots) in a wireless mesh\nnetwork. In that respect, the contributions of the paper\nrepresent measurable progress on the following fronts:\n(1) formulation of MILP to perform optimal jointly\nspanning tree construction and scheduling that min-\nimizes the required frame length in timeslots;\nV. Friderikos and K. Papadaki 3\n(2) interference aware iterative pruning routing algo-\nrithms to construct spanning trees in the WMN with\na minimum frame length schedule;\n(3) quantification of the gains in terms of scheduling\nof the pruning schemes compared to previously\nproposed schemes based on an extensive set of\nsimulations.\nIt is worth mentioning that even though in this paper we have\nassumed omnidirectional antennas (0 dB gain) and baseline\npath loss models, the proposed scheme is independent of the\noperational characteristics and models used. Thus, results\ndrawn in this paper can be applied for different antenna\nradiation patterns and\/or link gain models.\n3. PROBLEMDESCRIPTION\nBefore embarking our study of suboptimal solutions in\nlater sections, we first formulate the problem of joint\nrouting and scheduling as an MILP. Section 3.1 deals with\nthe mathematical programming formulation for performing\nSTDMA scheduling under the assumption of a predefined\nroute and Section 3.2 augments the scheduling model to\nincorporate routing decisions.\nFor performing joint scheduling and routing in WMNs,\nwe consider the graph G, defined by the (V ,L) pair, where\nV is a set of vertices (wireless nodes) and L is the set of\ntransmission links that satisfy the SINR threshold criterion,\nL = {(u, v) | u, v \u2208 V s.t. u \/=v can transmit to v\nand vice versa\n}\n.\n(1)\nRouting is usually performed using a weighting function\nw : L\u2192R, which assigns a weight to each edge. The weight of\nan edge is commonly related with the required transmission\npower, which depends on the Euclidean distance between\nthe nodes and the level of interference. A number of\ndifferent possible edge weights that implicitly take into\naccount scheduling information for suboptimal routing and\nscheduling will be discussed in the following sections.\n3.1. Amixed-integer linear programming (MILP)\nformulation for scheduling\nWe first focus our attention on how to perform optimal\nscheduling decisions under the assumption that routing\npaths are preconstructed. Similar formulations appear in\n[16, 17]. In this case, the routing will create the directed\ngraph GS = (V ,LS), where LS \u2286 L, and scheduling will be\nperformed on GS.\nWe encapsulate power control within the MILP formu-\nlation by introducing the variable pi jt, which expresses the\ntransmitted power by node i in link (i, j) at timeslot t,\nunder the constraint that 0 \u2264 pi jt \u2264 Pmax for all t. The\nvariable Pmaxexpresses the power ceiling at the transmitting\nnode (without loss of generality Pmax is assumed to be equal\nfor all nodes in the WMN). Additionally, we assume that\nomnidirectional antennas are used by all wireless nodes to\ntransmit and receive signals. Thus, the interference level\nproduced by link (i, j) to all other receiving nodes will\nbe based on their Euclidean distance with node i. With\na constant target bit error rate (i.e., Eb\/N0 = \u0393), the\ntransmission can be translated into a signal-to-interference\nratio requirement, which will be denoted hereafter as \u03b3. By\nW we denote the lump sum thermal noise power, and by gi j\nthe link gain between nodes i, j which encapsulates both path\nloss and slow fading.\nTo be able to express now the problem in a mathematical\nprogramming setting, we introduce the boolean variables xi jt\nand \u03c0t , which are defined as follows:\nxi jt =\n\u23a7\n\u23a8\n\u23a9\n1, if link (i, j) active at timeslot t,\n0, otherwise,\n\u03c0t =\n\u23a7\n\u23a8\n\u23a9\n1, if timeslot t is used,\n0, otherwise.\n(2)\nThe mixed-integer linear program for scheduling that mini-\nmizes the required frame length in a predefined route on the\nset of links LS is denoted as OS (LS) and can be written as\nfollows:\nmin\nM\u2211\nt=1\n\u03c0t, (3)\n\u2211\n(i, j)\u2208LS\nxi jt \u2264 \u03c0t\u00b7|LS| \u2200t, (4)\nM\u2211\nt=1\nxi jt \u2265 1 \u2200(i, j) \u2208 LS, (5)\n\u2211\nj:(i, j)\u2208LS\nxi jt +\n\u2211\nk:(k,i)\u2208LS\nxkit \u2264 1 \u2200i \u2208 V , \u2200t, (6)\ngi j pi jt +\n(\n1\u2212 xi jt\n)\n\u039b\n\u2211\n(m,n)\u2208LS\\{(i, j)}gmj pmnt + W\n\u2265 \u03b3 \u2200(i, j) \u2208 LS, \u2200t, (7)\nxi jt \u2264\npi jtgi j\nW\u03b3\n\u2200(i, j) \u2208 LS, \u2200t, (8)\nxi jt \u2265 pi jt\/Pmax \u2200(i, j) \u2208 LS, \u2200t, (9)\nxi jt \u2208 {0, 1} \u2200(i, j) \u2208 LS, \u2200t, (10)\n\u03c0t \u2208 {0, 1} \u2200t, (11)\n0 \u2264 pi jt \u2264 Pmax \u2200(i, j) \u2208 LS, \u2200t. (12)\nIn this formulation, an initial frame length M is assumed,\nwhere all links can be easily scheduled. For example, an initial\nframe length value M could be the number of links.\nConstraints (4) are the binding constraints for variables\n\u03c0t and xi jt. The requirement that all links transmit at least\nonce during the frame length is ensured by constraint (5).\nConstraint (6) is the degree constraint, that is, a node\ncannot transmit and receive at the same timeslot. Constraint\n(7) expresses the required SINR threshold that should be\nsatisfied in order to have a successful reception at the\nreceiver. The term \u039b(1 \u2212 xi jt) ensures that the inequality is\nsatisfied when link (i, j) does not transmit at timeslot t, for\na sufficiently high value of \u039b. The binding constraints for\n4 EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking\nvariables xi jt and pi jt are shown in (8) and (9). These binding\nconstraints ensure that if link (i, j) is not transmitting at\ntimeslot t, then the transmitted power pi jt is zero and vice\nversa. Constraint (8) is based on the assumption that all\nlinks (i, j) in LS satisfy the SINR constraint when there are\nno concurrent transmissions, which is equivalent to gi j pi jt >\n\u03b3W .\n3.2. Performing joint scheduling and routing\nIn the previous section, we formulated the scheduling\nproblem given a fixed routing LS. Allowing flexibility with\nrouting decisions can improve the resulting scheduling. The\naim here is to construct a routing such that the number of\ntimeslots in a time frame is minimized. We focus our routing\ndecisions on constructing spanning trees. The direction of\nthe spanning tree depends on whether we are performing\nuplink or downlink transmission.\nWe augment the previously defined scheduling model to\nincorporate both routing (tree construction) and scheduling\ndecisions. Note that the optimal joint routing and scheduling\nproblem operate on the graph G = (V ,L). Before describing\nthe new constraints that need to be added, we first introduce\nthe routing variables yi, j , which are defined as follows:\nyi j =\n\u23a7\n\u23a8\n\u23a9\n1, link (i, j) in optimal spanning tree,\n0, otherwise.\n(13)\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that node r is the root\nnode in the constructed spanning tree. Based on the above\ndefinitions, the optimal joint scheduling and spanning tree\nconstruction problem will be denoted as OSR (L), which is\nbased on the set of all feasible links L. The mathematical\nformulation of the OSR (L) can be constructed by adding the\nfollowing routing constraints to the already defined OS (L)\nformulation:\nyi j \u2264\nM\u2211\nt=1\nxi jt \u2264 yi j\u00b7M \u2200(i, j) \u2208 L, (14)\n\u2211\n(i, j)\u2208L:i, j\u2208D\nyi j \u2264 |D| \u2212 1 \u2200D \u2286 V , (15)\n\u2211\n(i, j)\u2208L\nyi j = |V | \u2212 1 \u2200(i, j) \u2208 L, (16)\n\u2211\nj\u2208V :(i, j)\u2208L\nyi j = 1 \u2200i \u2208 V \\ {r},\n\u2211\n(r,i)\u2208L\nyri = 0, (17)\nyi j + yji \u2264 1 \u2200(i, j) \u2208 L. (18)\nConstraint (14) binds the boolean variables xi jt and yi j\nso that a link (i, j) transmits if and only if it belongs to the\noptimal spanning tree. Constraint (15) ensure that there are\nno cycles and constraint (16) ensure that there are |V | \u2212 1\nlinks. Since an acyclic graph with |V | nodes and |V |\u22121 edges\nis a spanning tree, the previous two constraints construct\na spanning tree. Constraints (17), (18) ensure that the tree\nis directed in the uplink direction towards root node r. In\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nRoot node\nFigure 1: Worst-case scenario for timeslot reuse: the number of\nrequired timeslots is equal to the number of edges (i.e., M = |L|).\nthe case of downlink, constraint (17) are replaced by the\nfollowing:\n\u2211\nj\u2208V :( j,i)\u2208L\ny ji = 1 \u2200i \u2208 V \\ {r},\n\u2211\n(i,r)\u2208L\nyir = 0. (19)\nThe OSR (L) formulation constructs a tree that produces\nschedules with the minimal timeslot frame length. Given\nthat OR (LS) is an N P -complete problem [8], the N P -\ncompleteness of OSR (L) follows.\n4. THE BINDING NATURE OF SPANNING TREE\nCONSTRUCTION AND SCHEDULING\nThe aim of this section is twofold. Firstly, to reveal the closely\ncoupled nature of the spanning tree construction and the\nscheduling problem by focusing on the uplink transmission\nproblem. Secondly, this discussion will motivate the pro-\nposed scheme with polynomial computational complexity\nfor spanning tree construction.\nFigure 1 shows the worst-case scenario of a minimum\npower spanning tree in terms of utilization of the timeslots.\nAs shown in the figure, the transmission areas of the nodes\nare nested in the sense that each node\u2019s transmission area\nincludes all nodes that are further away from the root node.\nIf we define the transmission area of node i as Ai, then nodes\n{i, i + 1, i + 2 . . .} fall within the area Ai. This means that\neach node i cannot transmit at the same timeslot as nodes\ni+1, i+2, . . .. Thus, no concurrent transmission can occur and\nthe number of timeslots required for all nodes to transmit\ngrows linearly, \u03a9(n) with the number of transmitting nodes.\nOn the other hand, Figure 2 depicts a topology where the\nminimum power spanning tree requires only two timeslots\nfor all the nodes to transmit. Two timeslots is the minimum\nnumber required since the degree of the topology is two.\nAs shown in the figure, two timeslots are sufficient since\nthe transmission areas of nodes transmitting at timeslot one\n(or two) do not overlap. Note that this one-dimensional\ntopology has the minimum interference between nodes that\ntransmit concurrently at timeslots one or two and, in this\ncase, a new timeslot will only be required if the aggregate\nV.

SHORTEST-PATH TREE CONSTRUCTION\nSCHEMES INWMN\u2019S\nThe joint routing and scheduling problem defined in\nSection 5 is N P -complete and thus intractable for realistic\nnetwork sizes. Thus, we turn our attention to existing routing\nalgorithms and try to incorporate scheduling information\ninto routing decisions.\nIn most widely used routing protocols for constructing\ntrees, the paths are computed based on Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm\nto find shortest-path spanning trees. The weight assigned to\neach link (i, j), w(i, j) is usually taken to be proportional to\nthe power needed to transmit on link (i, j). In the sequel,\nwe propose Dijkstra-based routing schemes that use different\nweights with the aim of improving link scheduling. In\nSection 7, we evaluate the performance of these schemes and\ncompare them to the proposed interference aware pruning\nrouting scheme, described in Section 6.\n5.1. Minimumpower routing (MPR)\nThis scheme constructs shortest-path spanning trees in G =\n(V ,L) from the root node r to all other nodes V \\ {r} using\nDijkstra with transmitted power as a link cost. This cost\nresults in reduction of the overall interference. Given that\nthe transmitted power for link (i, j) relates to the distance\nbetween nodes i and j, d(i, j), we define the following cost\nfor MPR:\nwP(i, j) = d(i, j)\u03b1, (20)\nwhere \u03b1 is the path loss exponent which varies between 2\nand 4.\nIn order to examine the effect of Dijkstra-based routing\nschemes on scheduling decisions, we assume in this section\nthe following simple interference model: the interference\ncaused during the transmission of link (i, j) only results\nin unsuccessful reception of nodes that lie within the disc\nwith center i and radius d(i, j). Any receiving nodes that lie\noutside the disc are unaffected. We call this model as disc-\nbased interference (it is also widely known as the protocol\ninterference model [18]).\nProposition 1. Assuming a disc-based interference model, the\nMPR scheme does not result in a schedule with minimum\ntimeslot frame length.\nProof. We show this using a counter example. Figure 3(a)\nshows the shortest-path spanning tree constructed by MPR\nfor the given topology in the case of downlink transmission.\nIn the MPR tree, the transmission of link (i,m) is affecting\nfive links (including the link that has a degree constraint\nwith link (i,m)). These five links require four timeslots\n(minimum), and since none of them can be reused, the\nrequired number of timeslots should be increased by one to\naccommodate link (i,m). In the tree shown in Figure3(b),\nnode m is connected via node j. In this case, the link ( j,m)\nis affecting two links (the link from root node to node n, and\nlink (n, j)), and, therefore, one of the four timeslots from the\nother branch of the tree can be reused.\nThe tree depicted in Figure 3(b) is not a shortest-path\nspanning tree with respect to wP since the path from node\nm to the root node is longer than the equivalent path\nin Figure 3(a). However, the tree in Figure 3(b) produces\na schedule with shorter frame length (in terms of times-\nlots).\nShortest-path spanning trees can be computed in poly-\nnomial time using the Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford algorithms.\nA brute force approach to find the tree with the minimum\nframe length would be to enumerate all possible trees and\nfor each one to perform optimal scheduling. Even without\ntaking into account the embedded scheduling problem, enu-\nmerating all trees has exponential computational complexity\ndue to Proposition 2.\nProposition 2 (Cayleys Formula). The number of labeled\ntrees on n vertices is nn\u22122.\n6 EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking\n1\n2\n3\n2\n4 2\n5\n3\nn\nj\nm\ni\nd1\nRoot node\n(a)\n1 2\n3\n2\n4\n2\n3\n4\nn\nj\nm\ni\nd2\nRoot node\n(b)\nFigure 3: (a) Minimum power spanning tree (MPST), and (b) a\nspanning tree that requires less number of timeslots (better spatial\nreuse). Timeslots are shown within the rectangular boxes.\n5.2. Minimumnearest neighborhoods routing\u2014MNR\nThe MNR algorithm tries to minimize the number of nodes\nthat are within the area of each link in the shortest-path\nspanning tree. In order to compute such a tree, Dijkstra\u2019s\nalgorithm can be deployed where the cost of each link (i, j) \u2208\nL is equal to the number of receiving nodes that are within its\ntransmission range (taken to be the disc of center i and radius\nd(i, j)). In this case, the cost can be written as follows:\nwN (i, j) =\n\u2211\nn\u2208V\\{i, j,r}\nI(i, j)(n), (21)\nwhere I(i, j)(n) is the indicator function which is defined as\nfollows for n \/= i, j:\nI(i, j)(n) =\n\u23a7\n\u23a8\n\u23a9\n1, if d(i,n) \u2264 d(i, j),\n0, otherwise.\n(22)\nThis algorithm can also include a lower bound on the\nnumber of nodes that are within the transmission range of\neach link so that connectivity can be established with high\nprobability [19].\na\nb\nc\nd\nFigure 4: Possible edge crossing in the minimum nearest neighbor-\nhoods spanning tree algorithm.\nA drawback of this scheme is that it may introduce edge\ncrossings in the constructed tree.\nProposition 3. The MNR scheme may create shortest-path\nspanning trees that are nonplanar graphs.\nProof. Figure 4 shows a possible construction of a spanning\ntree based on the MNR algorithm. The root node is node a\nand after the construction of links (a, b), which has cost 0,\nand (a, c), which has cost 1, the cost of the link (b,d) is 4\n(nodes within the circle shown by solid lines) whilst the cost\nfor links (a,d) and (c,d) is 5 and 7, respectively (nodes within\nthe dashed and doted dashed circles, resp.). Thus, the least-\ncost path to node d is through node b and, therefore, an edge\ncrossing will be introduced.\nLink crossing can be detected, and, subsequently, pla-\nnarity can be restored, but the current proposed techniques\nneed to be adapted before being applied for tree construction\n(see [20] and references therein).\n5.3. Interference based routing\u2014IR\nIn this case, the actual interference that will be produced\nto the other receiving nodes in the network is taken into\naccount to produce the cost for every link in the network.\nMore specifically, the cost for link (i, j) is computed as\nfollows:\nwI(i, j) =\n\u2211\nn\u2208V\\{i, j,r}g(i,n)\ng(i, j)\n. (23)\nTherefore, the cost for link (i, j) is inversely proportional to\nthe link gain g(i, j) but weighted with the aggregate link gains\nof node i to all other receiving nodes in the network. Thus,\nthe actual interference that will be produced by link (i, j) is\nexplicitly taken into account.\n5.4. Weighted power and interference routing (WPIR)\nIn WPIR, the two different metrics (i.e., required power for\nestablishing the link and interference caused by the link) are\nV. Friderikos and K. Papadaki 7\ncondensed into a single metric via a linear combination. The\ncost for link (i, j) can be, therefore, written as follows:\nwPI(i, j) = \u03b2wP(i, j)\u0398 + (1\u2212 \u03b2)wI(i, j), (24)\nwhere \u03b2 controls the weight of each individual metric in\nthe cost and \u0398 is a normalizing constant between the\naverage wP and wI values. By this linear combination, a\nsingle weight is assigned to every link and thus it becomes\npossible to use a Dijkstra-like algorithm. Since different\nspanning trees will be constructed with different values of \u03b2,\na drawback of this scheme is that by linearly combining the\ntwo metrics, the optimal weighting value will be different for\ndifferent topologies. This routing scheme is similar to the one\ndiscussed in [21].\n6. INTERFERENCE AWARE PRUNING ROUTING\nALGORITHM\u2014IAPR\nThe algorithm presented herein is based on an iterative\nversion of the Dijkstra\u2019s shortest-path algorithm. At each\niteration of the algorithm, links that produce the highest\ninterference are pruned in later iterations of the algorithm.\nThe idea is that by excluding links that produce severe\ninterference, the spatial timeslot reuse could be enhanced.\nAt iteration k, a shortest-path spanning tree Tk is\nconstructed using weights wP based on the set of available\nlinks, and scheduling is performed on Tk to find the\nminimum frame length Sk to schedule all links in the tree.\nThe function Ik(e) is a metric of interference produced by\nlink e at iteration k in shortest-path spanning tree Tk . The\nspanning tree is updated at each iteration by removing the\nlink with the highest interference and running Dijkstra on\nthe remaining links. We keep the spanning that produced a\nschedule with the minimum frame length. This continues\nuntil the stopping criteria of the algorithm are satisfied.\nThe pseudocode of the proposed IAPR scheme is shown in\nAlgorithm 1.\n6.1. Properties of the IAPR scheme\nSince the pruning algorithm eliminates at each iteration links\nthat have been previously used in constructing shortest-\npath spanning trees, the aggregate shortest-path cost will\nnot decrease with iterations. This characteristic of the IAPR\nscheme is encapsulated in the following result. Let us denote\nby pk(i) the aggregate power for the shortest path in Tk from\nthe root node to node i (downlink case), and let K be the\nmaximum number of iterations that the pruning scheme\nruns.\nProposition 4. If by Pk =\n\u2211\ni\u2208V\\{r}pk(i) we denote the\naggregate transmitted power in tree Tk constructed by IAPR\nalgorithm at iterations k, then\nP1 \u2264 P2 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 PK . (25)\nThe result below is specific to the downlink case,\nhowever, the corresponding result for the uplink holds.\n1: G(V ,L) \u2190 G(V ,L), pre-processing (see Section 6.2)\n2: k \u2190 0,\n3: K , maximum number of iterations\n4: T , best spanning tree found so far\n5: S, minimum frame length achieved so far\n6: Tk \u2190 \u2205, spanning tree at iteration k\n7: Sk = |L|, frame length achieved at iteration k by tree Tk\n8: repeat\n9: if k = 0 then\n10: Tk+1 \u2190 Dijkstra using wP on G(V ,L)\n11: else\n12: Tk+1 \u2190Modified Dijkstra using wP on G(V ,L)\n13: end if\n14: Sk+1 \u2190 Schedule(Tk+1)\n15: if Sk+1 < S then\n16: T \u2190 Tk+1\n17: S\u2190 Sk+1\n18: end if\n19: Find link e \u2208 L such that Ik+1(e) = maxl\u2208L{Ik+1(l)}\n20: L\u2190 L \\ {e}\n21: k \u2190 k + 1\n22: until (k > K)\n23: return T , S\nAlgorithm 1: Interference aware pruning routing (IAPR).\nLemma 1. Suppose link (i, j) is eliminated at iteration k of\nthe IAPR algorithm in the downlink case. Then, there exists at\nleast one spanning tree found at iteration k + 1, Tk+1 with the\nfollowing property: all nodes of tree Tk, that node j is not one of\ntheir parents, will have the same predecessor in tree Tk+1.\nProof. Since link (i, j) \u2208 Tk , (i, j) belongs to the shortest path\nfrom root node to node j in Tk. Eliminating (i, j) at iteration\nk, the shortest-path cost to node j in Tk+1 will increase (or\nremain the same). Thus, pk+1( j) \u2265 pk( j). Thus, any node\nthat did not have node j as a parent in tree Tk will not have j\nas a parent in tree Tk+1.\nLemma 1 indicates that trees Tk and Tk+1 may have a\nlarge set of common links. This observation motivates the\nfollowing modification of the Dijkstra algorithm.\nDefinition 1. The modified Dijkstra algorithm takes as input\nthe graph Gk = (V ,Lk), the shortest-path spanning tree Tk\nof Gk, and a link (i, j) \u2208 Tk,Lk, and produces a spanning tree\nTk+1 of Gk+1 = (V ,Lk+1), where Lk+1 = Lk \\ {(i, j)}.\n(1) The set of nodes V is partitioned into two sets: V1\nis the set of nodes whose shortest path from the root\nnode on Tk includes link (i, j), and V2 is the set of all\nremaining nodes.\n(2) The modified Dijkstra assumes that shortest paths for\nnodes in V2 are the same as the ones constructed in\ntree Tk. Thus, shortest paths for this set of nodes are\nnot recalculated.\n(3) The algorithm calculates the shortest paths for the set\nof nodes in V1 according to the Dijkstra algorithm.\n8 EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking\nProposition 5. The tree produced by the modified Dijkstra\nalgorithm is a shortest-path spanning tree.\nProof. The proof follows from Lemma 1.\nThe above modification of the Dijkstra algorithm is used\nto accelerate the updating of trees in the IAPR scheme at\niterations k \u2265 1.\n6.2. Preprocessing on the initial graph\nIn order to accelerate the performance of the algorithm, the\nfollowing preprocessing step can be implemented. In graph\nG(V ,L) of WMN, the set L of links is reduced by considering\nonly links (i, j) that havewN (i, j) \u2264 Nmax (i.e., only links with\nless than Nmax neighbors are considered) (see Section 5.2).\n6.3. Complexity of IAPR\nThe computational complexity that pertains one iteration\nof the algorithm is that of the modified Dijkstra algorithm,\nthe pruning operation, and the scheduling engine. Assuming\na greedy packing heuristic for scheduling (see Section 7),\nthe complexity of each aforementioned step in one iteration\nis O(n logn). In the worst-case scenario, the algorithm\nterminates after K iterations, thus the complexity of the\noverall computational can be O(Kn logn) steps.\n6.4. Stopping criterion\nIn general, a stopping criterion is needed to avoid pruning\nlinks that are required to ensure connectivity. A possible\nstopping criterion could be to hault the algorithm at the\niteration at which the remaining links no longer can ensure\na connected graph. This would mean that we run the\nalgorithm in the order of |V |2 iterations, in the case of dense\nnetworks, that is, complete graphs. However, in practise\nafter the removal of a few high interference links at the\nbeginning, the algorithm will stop improving. Even though\nthe algorithm will not deteriorate after many iterations (since\nwe keep the best schedule), it will be unnecessary to run\nit until the graph is disconnected. This is intuitive and we\nhave also verified it experimentally as will be shown in later\nsections. Thus, either a relatively small number of iterations\nshould be chosen or the algorithm should run within some\npredefined small time limit. An operator, for example, can\nput a maximum time limit on the computational time for\nrunning the routing algorithm. In that case, the number of\niterations will be limited by this time limit.\n6.5. A randomized version of the IAPR\nAt each iteration of the IAPR scheme, the link that produces\nthe highest interference is pruned with probability one,\nirrespectively of whether the framelength is decreased or not.\nA variation of the scheme could be to check a number of\nlinks ordered by the level of interference they produce, and\nprune the first link whose removal improves the framelength.\nIn this case, a number of pruning options are considered\nand the scheme proceeds in the direction that improves the\nframelength. However, in the case that none of the V \u2212 1\nlinks of the shortest-path tree (when pruned) improve the\nframelength, the above scheme will be unable to search\nfurther and thus stall. In order to further increase the search\nspace and at the same time avoid stalling, we randomize the\nabove scheme by pruning a link with a small probability\np, even though the resulting frame length produced by\nremoving this link is not leading to an improvement.\nThe pseudocode of the randomized version of the IAPR\nscheme (R-IAPR) is shown in Algorithm 2. In the worst-\ncase scenario, the algorithm in each iteration will test all\nlinks in the shortest-path tree. Therefore, the computational\ncomplexity of the R-IAPR scheme can be O(K(V\u22121)n logn)\nsteps.\n7. NUMERICAL INVESTIGATIONS\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed\nIAPR scheme (both the deterministic and randomized one)\ncompared to the MPR, MNR, IR, and WPIR schemes\nthat have been detailed in Section 5. Simulations are con-\nducted on different randomly generated WMN topolo-\ngies. For all different schemes, a simple greedy heuristic\nfor evaluating the scheduling has been used, which is\ndescribed in Algorithm 3. We denote by S the frame length\nachieved by either the optimal scheduling or the packing\nheuristic.\nThe packing heuristic tries to pack as many links as\npossible in each time slot that have not yet transmitted in\nprevious time slots (list A), giving priority to the ones with\nthe highest transmitted power. This continues until all links\nhave transmitted at least once (list A is empty). This packing\nheuristic is similar to a heuristic used in [16, 22, 23], where it\nwas shown to produce satisfactory solutions.\nThe IAPR (and R-IAPR) scheme uses the packing\nheuristic at each iteration to evaluate the scheduling of\nthe current shortest path spanning tree. Further, we use\nthe following function to evaluate the interference caused\nby each link (i, j) in the shortest-path spanning tree Tk:\nIk((i, j)) = wN (i, j), that is, the number of receiving nodes\nthat are within the disc with center i and radius d(i, j).\nFor the WPIR scheme, the value of \u0398 has been selected\nto normalize the average power weight wP and the average\ninterference weight wI . The value of \u03b2 = 0.5, which gives\nequal weight to the two metrics, has been used in the\nsimulations.\nFor the numerical investigations reported in the fol-\nlowing sections the parameterization of the simulation\nenvironment is as follows. The path loss model for link (i, j)\nis PLd(i, j) = PL (do) + 10 \u03b7 log10(d(i, j)\/do), where d(i, j)\nis the distance of link (i, j), PL (do) is the close in distance\nloss (40 dB) for distance do (100 m), and \u03b7 is the path loss\nexponent, which is assumed to be equal to 3. The value of the\nSINR threshold \u03b3 is 5 dB. The thermal and background noise\nat the receiver W is assumed to be 10\u221211 Watt, the carrier\nfrequency 2500 MHz, and the maximum transmission power\nPmax is equal to 50 Watts for all nodes.\nV.

Main results\nThe performance of the different routing schemes has been\ntested with varying number of nodes in the WMN. The\naverage frame length (in terms of timeslots) and the standard\ndeviation of the framelength has been measured for 100\nrandom uniformly distributed WMN\u2019s with 40, 60, and\n80 nodes. The packing heuristic was used to evaluate the\nscheduling and the results are detailed in Table 1. From\nTable 1, two interesting conclusions can be drawn. The first\none is that in all different scenarios, the IAPR scheme\noutperforms all the other routing algorithms. The average\nperformance gains in terms of minimum framelength with\nrespect to the second best routing scheme, which is MPR,\nrange between 3.2% and 4.7%. It is interesting to note\nthat the standard deviation of the IAPR averaged across\nall different scenarios is 13% better than that of the MPR\nscheme. This is of significant importance because the IARP\nscheme not only has better average minimum framelength\nbut is also more robust to WMN topologies. Secondly, and as\nmentioned earlier, the MPR scheme outperforms the other\nrouting schemes, except IAPR.

For this topology, the minimum number\nof timeslots computed by CPLEX was 5 (this solution was\nfound within 200 seconds). In Figure 6, we compare the\nnumber of timeslots computed for the same topology for\nthe different routing schemes with optimal and heuristic\nscheduling. As can be seen from the figure, when using\nthe heuristic scheduling, the pruning scheme provides a\n6.7% improvement compared to the other routing schemes.\nIt is also worth mentioning that when using the optimal\nscheduling, three out of five routing schemes achieve the\nsame number of timeslots as the optimal joint scheduling\nand routing.\nOne interesting question is that if we run the pruning\nalgorithm for a fixed number of iterations, at which iteration\nwill it find the schedule with the minimum possible frame\nlength? To shed some light on that question, we have\nperformed the following experiment. For a specific number\nof nodes in the network, namely, 40 in this case, 100\nuniformly distributed topologies have been generated in a\n3 \u00d7 3 km rectangular area. For each topology, we perform\n30 pruning operations and store the iteration where the\nIAPR scheme found the frame length with the minimum\nnumber of timeslots. We have repeated this procedure for\neach topology and the result is shown in Figure 7, which\ndepicts the empirical cumulative distribution function (cdf)\nthat has been obtained by the experiment. The empirical\ncdf reveals that with 90% probability, the pruning algorithm\nfinds the schedule with the minimum timeslot span in less\nthan 14 iterations.\n7.2. Randomized pruning scheme\nIn Section 6.5, we described a variation of the pruning\nscheme (called R-IAPR) that increases the search space for\na better solution by testing more links or by randomizing the\nsearch. After demonstrating the improvement performed by\nthe IAPR scheme in Section 7.1, we proceed to demonstrate\nthat the randomized version of the IAPR scheme can offer\nfurther improvement.\nTable 2 shows the average framelength (in terms of\ntimeslots) and the standard deviation of the frame length,\naveraged over 100 random uniformly distributed WMN\ntopologies with 40, 60, and 80 nodes, respectively, for the\nMPR, IAPR, and R-IAPR schemes. For the R-IAPR scheme,\nwe used pruning probability p = 1\/3V (see Section 6.5). The\naverage gains of the pruning schemes are also displayed. We\nobserve that the improvement in performance is evident over\nall three network sizes, with the randomized pruning scheme\noffering a consistent enhancement in performance over the\nIAPR scheme.\n7.3. Routing illustrations\nFigure 8 shows the spanning trees constructed by the differ-\nent schemes in the case of a random WMN topology with\n30 nodes. In this scenario, the packing heuristic has been\nused as the scheduling technique for evaluating the frame\nlengths produced by the different routing schemes. The IAPR\nscheme requires 17 timeslots (Figure 8(a)), while the R-IAPR\nTable 2: Average timeframes of MPR, IAPR, R-IAPR routing\nschemes, and average performance gains of the pruning schemes.\nNodes 40 60 80\nTimeslots avg. std. avg. std. avg. std.\nMPR 13.17 1.37 14.99 1.59 16.02 1.44\nIAPR 12.58 1.32 14.23 1.57 15.45 1.31\nR-IAPR 12.23 1.22 13.76 1.31 14.89 1.25\ngains over MPR avg. avg. avg.\nIAPR 4.34 4.96 3.42\nR-IAPR 6.94 7.91 6.90\nscheme requires 16 timeslots (Figure 8(b)). These should be\ncompared to the MPR and the WPIR schemes, which both\nrequire 19 timeslots (Figures 8(c) and 8(b), resp.). Thus, the\nR-IARP scheme provides more than 15% improvement over\nthe MPR. It is also interesting to note that for this scenario,\nthe MNR scheme achieved the same frame length as the\nIARP. Note also that even though the spatial reuse for MPR,\nWPIR, and IR schemes is the same, the constructed spanning\ntrees are very different.\n8. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, an interference aware pruning-based routing\nscheme has been proposed which strives to optimize path\nselection and STDMA scheduling. A randomized version\nof the pruning scheme has also been detailed and has\nbeen shown to improve the later heuristic. We have formu-\nlated the corresponding MILP to perform joint scheduling\nand routing, and used this formulation to compare the\nperformance of the proposed scheme with the optimal\njoint scheduling and routing. The routing schemes were\nevaluated using both a greedy scheduling heuristic and\noptimal scheduling. Extensive performance evaluation in\ndifferent network settings of the proposed scheme revealed\nthat it outperforms the previously proposed routing schemes\nwhere interference and power consumption are used as a\nrouting metric.\nWe should note that the general nature of the algorithms\npresented in this paper, including the proposed ones, is\napplicable to more general network settings that can include\ndirectional pattern transmissions and link gains that capture\nmore precisely slow signal variations due to the physical\nterrain. Furthermore, we merely looked at the joint routing\nand scheduling problem without considering flows and\nthe corresponding requirement of conserving them. This\nsimplification allowed us to shed light into the interplay\nbetween the two engines and compare different schemes. We\nleft the study of such augmented models that incorporate\nnetwork flow requirements as an avenue of future research.\nREFERENCES\n[1] I. F. Akyildiz, X. Wang, and W.
