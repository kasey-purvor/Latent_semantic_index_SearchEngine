Phoevos Panagiotidis, University of Cyprus \nTheodore Marinis, University of Reading \n \nABSTRACT \nDeterminer Spreading (DS) occurs in adjectivally modified nominal phrases \ncomprising more than one definite article, a phenomenon that has received \nconsiderable attention and has been extensively described in Greek. This \npaper discusses the syntactic properties of DS in detail and argues that DS \nstructures are both arguments and predication configurations involving two \nDPs. This account successfully captures the word-order facts and the \ndistinctive interpretation of DS, while also laying the groundwork towards \nunifying it with other structures linking two DPs in a predicative relation. \n \n1 INTRODUCTION \n \nDeterminer Spreading (\u2018DS\u2019 henceforth) is a nominal construction in \nModern Greek (\u2018Greek\u2019 henceforth), in which more than one definite article \ncan appear in front of the noun phrase\u2019s adjectives.1 DS is actually attested \nthrough most of the history of the Greek language, going back to at least \nHerodotus (5th century BC), and displays distinctive interpretive \ncharacteristics.2 DS prototypically involves a D(eterminer)-A(djective)-\n  \n2 \n \nD(eterminer)-N(oun) order or a D(eterminer)-N(oun)-D(eterminer)-\nA(djective) one, and it exists alongside \u2018ordinary\u2019 adjectival modification, \ndisplaying a (D)-A-N or an N-A order. The phenomenon is intriguing for a \nnumber of reasons: why do these two different ways of \u2018doing\u2019 adjectival \nmodification exist? What are their interpretive differences? How can we \nexplain noun phrase-internal determiners and a single noun in an analysis \nadhering to the DP-hypothesis (popularised by Abney, 1987 \u2013 but of many \nprogenitors)? \n This paper will examine Determiner Spreading from a syntactic \npoint of view and touch upon its semantics only in order to clarify matters of \nstructure. Insightful semantic approaches to the phenomenon, although not \nfully compatible with the syntactic analysis put forward here, are provided in \nLarson (2004), Kolliakou (2003; 2004) and Campos & Stavrou (2004). In \nthis paper we will argue that DS is a DP-predication structure. More \nspecifically, we claim that a DS structure is a DP with a DP specifier, the \nsubject of predication; the whole constituent serves both as an argument and \nas a predication structure. \n The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the properties \nof DS; Section 3 reviews previous analyses of the phenomenon; Section 4 \npresents our own analysis and shows how, with minimal assumptions, it \ncorrectly accounts for the Greek facts; finally, a summary and conclusions \nare given in Section 5. \n  \n3 \n \n \n2 THE DATA \n \nDS is a type of adjectival modification that involves the use of multiple \ndefinite articles preceding adjectives and the noun. Moreover, in DS only \ndefinite articles may precede adjectives and the noun. This section will \npresent the distributional properties of DS, that is the word order facts (in \nsubsection 2.1), as well as the interpretation of DS (in subsection 2.2). \n \n2.1. Possible word orders with DS \nWith DS several word orders are possible. As far as the position of one \nadjective relative to that of the noun is concerned, there are two possible \nword orders: Determiner-Noun-Determiner-Adjective (D-N-D-A), as shown \nin (1) and Determiner-Adjective-Determiner-Noun (D-A-D-N), as shown in \n(2). 3 \n \n(1) (a) To spiti to meghalo \n  the house the big  \n (b) *(*Ena) spiti to meghalo \n  a \/ one house the big  \n(2) (a) To meghalo to spiti. \n  \n4 \n \n  the big the house \n (b) *(*Ena) meghalo to spiti. \n  a \/ one big the house \n \u2018The big house\u2019 \n \nWhen more than one adjective is present in DS, then all the possible \ncombinations of constituents inside the nominal phrase are grammatical, \nprovided that all adjectives as well as the noun are preceded by definite \narticles. Thus, in the case of two adjectives and a noun, all the 3!=6 possible \ncombinations are grammatical, as shown in (3a-f) below. \n \n(3) (a) To meghalo to petrino to spiti. \n  the big the of.stone the house \n (b) To meghalo to spiti to petrino. \n  the big the house the of.stone \n (c) To petrino to spiti to meghalo. \n  the of.stone the house the big \n (d) To petrino to meghalo to spiti \n  the of.stone the big the house \n (e) To spiti to meghalo to petrino. \n  the house the big the of.stone \n (f) To spiti to petrino to meghalo. \n  \n5 \n \n  the house the of.stone the big \n \u2018The big stone house.\u2019  \n \nThe data in (3) above may give the impression that word order is free \nunder DS, to the point of this structure appearing flat or even non-\nconfigurational, which will actually be claimed in section 3.4 to be far from \ntrue. For the time being, having just presented the freedom of word order \nwithin DS constructions, let\u2019s turn to some word order restrictions at play. \nIn non-DS (\u2018monadic\u2019 in Kolliakou, 2003; 2004) Greek nominal \nphrases involving adjectival modification and headed by a definite article, \nadjectives are always prenominal, as shown in (4) below. \n(4) (a) To meghalo (petrino) spiti. \n  The big of.stone house \n (b)     *To spiti meghalo (petrino). \n  The house big of.stone \n \u2018The big stone house.\u2019 \nMoreover, in non-DS nominal phrases, the relative order of the adjectives \ntends to be rigid and is governed by restrictions related to their type (Cinque, \n1994; Stavrou, 1996 and 1999 for Greek). \nRegarding DS, a first prominent characteristic of the construction is \nthe following: not all adjectives need be preceded by an article, the noun can \nbe articleless, too. In this case, ordering freedom is restricted in two ways: \n  \n6 \n \nFirst, if one of the adjectives is not preceded by an article, it cannot \nappear postnominally, as shown in (5); contrast (5a) and (5b) below with \n(3e) above. \n \n(5) (a)    *To spiti meghalo to petrino. \n  The house big the of.stone \n (b)    *To spiti to meghalo petrino. \n  The house the big of.stone \n\u2018The big stone house.\u2019 \n \nSecond, and complementing the state of affairs exemplified under \n(5), if the noun is not preceded by an article, it is obligatory for it to \nimmediately follow an adjective, as in (6). Interestingly, sequences like to \npetrino spiti in (6a) and to meghalo spiti in (6b) look like fully-fledged \nmonadic DPs. \n \n(6) (a) To meghalo to petrino spiti. \n  The big the of.stone house \n (b) To meghalo spiti to petrino. \n  The big house the of.stone \n  \u2018The big stone house.\u2019 \n (c)   To meghalo petrino spiti to palio \n  \n7 \n \n  the big stone house the old \n  \u2018The old big stone house\u2019 \n \nThe statements in (7) recapitulate the word order state of affairs in DS: \n \n(7) (a) no indefinite articles can be involved in a DS noun phrase; \n(b) if all adjectives and the noun are preceded by the definite \narticle, ordering is free; \n(c) if the noun is not preceded by an article, it must be preceded by \nan adjective that is in turn preceded by an article; \n(d) adjectives can be used postnominally if they are preceded by a \ndefinite article. \n \n2.2. On the interpretation of DS \nNoun phrases with DS are interpreted differently from (monadic) definite \nnoun phrases, however subtle the difference. As Alexiadou & Wilder \n(1998), Manolessou (2000: Ch. 4), Kolliakou (1998; 2003; 2004) and \nCampos & Stavrou (2004) point out, DS is not semantically identical to \nadjectival modification with a single definite article. Adjectival modification \nwithin a monadic DP may have either a restrictive or a non-restrictive \ninterpretation, as in (8a) below; on the other hand, DS often receives only a \n  \n8 \n \nrestrictive reading, i.e. DS \u201c\u2018narrows down\u2019 a given set of referents by \npicking out a proper subset of it\u201d (Kolliakou 1998: 4-5; 2004: 268-276). \nThis is illustrated in (8b) below.4  \n \n(8) (a) O dhiefthindis dhilose oti i ikani erevnites   \n  the manager declared that the competent researchers  \n  tha  eprepe  na apolithun \n  FUT  had.to SUBJ fired.3RDPL \n\u2018The manager declared that the competent researchers should be \nfired.\u2019 (restrictive or non-restrictive interpretation) \n (b) O dhiefthindis dhilose oti i ikani i erevnites \n  the director declared that the competent the researchers \n  tha   eprepe na apolithun. \n  FUT  had.to SUBJ fired. 3RDPL \n\u2018The manager declared that just the competent researchers \nshould be fired.\u2019 (restrictive interpretation strongly preferred) \n \nIn (8a) above, an adjectivally modified definite noun phrase may \nhave either of two principal interpretations, a non-restrictive interpretation \nor a restrictive one. In the non-restrictive interpretation, we have information \nabout only one group of researchers, those who should be fired (for instance, \ndue to financial difficulties of the company) and who are also characterised \n  \n9 \n \nas competent; thus, there are no cues as to whether there is another group of \nresearchers who should not be fired: i ikani erevnites (\u2018the competent \nresearchers\u2019) describes a salient set of competent researchers. \nOn the other hand, in the restrictive interpretation of the DS noun \nphrase in (8b), a set of competent researchers is singled out from a larger set \nof researchers, a superset, and only the competent ones should be fired \n(maybe because they are involved in some secret plot against the company). \nIn the restrictive interpretation, it is implied that other researchers (who, for \ninstance, are not competent and therefore not dangerous for the company) \nshould not be fired. Under the restrictive interpretation, the nominal \nstructure with DS, say D-A-D-N (\u2018i ikani i erevnites\u2019), refers to a proper \nsubset of a set denoted by D-N (\u2018i erevnites\u2019). \nNow, as Manolessou (2000) observes,5 although the restrictive \ninterpretation is clearly the preferred one in cases like (8b), a non-restrictive \ninterpretation is also possible with DS, if properly contextualised. Moreover, \nin the ambiguous sentence (8a), prosody may be used to disambiguate \nbetween the two interpretations. If the adjective is stressed, the restrictive \ninterpretation is favoured here as well.6 Therefore, the restrictive reading is \nonly one of the possible interpretations for DS, albeit the preferred one in \nmost contexts. \nFollowing Manolessou (2000), let us now zoom into the possible \nnon-restrictive interpretation of DS, as in the contexts in (9) below: \n  \n10 \n \n \n(9) a. vyike exo s [ton krio ton kero]. \n  went-out out in the cold the weather \n \u2018S\/he went out in the cold weather.\u2019 \n b. Ti thelun [ta kala ta pedia]? \n  What want the good the children \n \u2018What do the good children want?\u2019 \n c. Bike s [to kenuryo (tis) to aftokinito] ki efiye \n  got.in.1STSG in the new hers the car and left \n  \u2018She got into the\/her new car and left.\u2019 \n \n Of course, given the discussion of example (3) above, the D-N-D-A \norders ton kero ton krio (\u2018the cold weather\u2019) and ta pedhia ta kala (\u2018the good \nchildren\u2019). However, the above examples cannot be naturally construed with \nrestrictive readings. (9a) can be uttered plainly if the weather is cold outside, \nnot necessarily only if cold weather is understood as a subset, say a special \ncase, of types of weather. Turning to the plural DS constituent in (9b), when \naddressing the children in question, which is a pragmatically felicitous usage \nof this sentence, the speaker does not mean to single out the set of good ones \nout of a salient set of children. Both cases represent run-of-the-mill usage \nand in all of them restrictive readings are strongly dispreferred. In this \nrespect, (9c) is perhaps the most revealing example, in the sense that the \n  \n11 \n \nconstituent to kenuryo to aftokinito (\u2018the new car\u2019) may indeed be read in a \nrestrictive way, picking out the new car out of a set of cars; nevertheless, it \nis also perfectly possible to use it even if just one car exists, which also \nhappens to be a new one. The point emerging here is that DS does have a \nspecial interpretation, but not necessarily a restrictive one. \nAs Manolessou (2000) and Campos & Stavrou (2004) point out, the \ninterpretation of the DS noun phrases in (9) is predicative. Nevertheless, this \nis not the whole story, as \u2018ordinary\u2019 adjectival modification can also be \npredicative, e.g. a white elephant \u2248 an elephant (that) is white (Partee 1995; \nLarson 1999). Hence, we have to be more precise about the predicative \ncharacter of DS while considering the restrictive interpretations available for \nit; in section 4 we will do so and claim that DS involves DP predication: it \nis a nominal constituent where one DP is predicated of another. So, in \nprinciple, DS is different from \u2018ordinary\u2019 adjectival modification because \nthe latter may involve picking out the intersection of two sets (Partee 1995 \nfor a classic overview), denoted by the predicate adjective and the predicate \nnoun respectively. In contrast, Determiner Spreading necessarily denotes the \nintersection of two sets, respectively denoted by an elliptical DP containing \nthe adjective and a DP containing the noun, in its simplest manifestation. \nThe importance of this predicative interpretation and its relation to the \nrestrictive one (in fact the latter will be shown to be a subcase of the former) \nwill be further explored in section 4.5.7 \n  \n12 \n \n \n3 PREVIOUS ANALYSES \n \nA number of analyses have been offered to account for the phenomenon of \nDS; we will now review four of them: Androutsopoulou (1994; 1995), \nAlexiadou & Wilder (1998), Giusti (2003) and Campos & Stavrou (2004).8 \nWe concentrate on them because these analyses offer well-articulated \nsyntactic accounts of the phenomenon within the framework followed here, \nPrinciples and Parameters aspiring towards Minimalism.9 It is also worth \nnoting that each of them is informed by major recent developments in \nsyntactic theory; hence: Androutsopoulou (1994; 1995) by the proposals that \na greater number of functional categories (may) exist, besides the better \nstudied C(omplementiser), I(nflection) and D(eterminer); Alexiadou & \nWilder (1998) by Kayne\u2019s (1994) Antisymmetry Hypothesis; Giusti (2003) \nby Chomsky\u2019s (1993) Bare Phrase Structure; Campos & Stavrou (2004) by \nBowers\u2019 (1993) and Den Dikken\u2019s (1998) postulation of a Pred(ication) \ncategory. \n3.1. Androutsopoulou (1994; 1995) \nAndroutsopoulou (1994; 1995) takes DS to be akin to Semitic \u2018definiteness \nspreading\u2019 (Ritter, 1991; Siloni, 1997; Dobrovie-Sorin, 2000). She claims \nthat the \u2018extra\u2019 definite articles in the structure of DS are not of the category \n  \n13 \n \nD, but rather spell-outs of a definiteness feature [+def], which is argued not \nto be a semantic feature, but a syntactic one. This is in the spirit of Delsing\u2019s \n(1988) analysis for Mainland Scandinavian, where \u2018intermediate\u2019 articles \nlook like the definite Determiner, but are not (pace Hellan, 1986 and \nTaraldsen, 1990).10 According to Androutsopoulou, every definite article in \nDS heads its own functional agreement projection, called Definite Phrase \n(DefP), hosting agreement features (gender, number, case) and the [+def] \nfeature. Although DefPs host the feature [+def], the locus of definiteness \nand referentiality is D and not the \u2018intermediate\u2019 articles, heads of DefPs. \nFinally, APs intervene in the projection line between D and N, \u00e0 la Abney \n(1987) and Radford (1993). The \u2018initial\u2019 structure being the one under (10), \nmovement to (the highest) SpecDefP derives the different word orders, an \ninstance thereof illustrated in (11) below. \n \n(10) DS (=3a) in Androutsopoulou\u2019s account \n  \n14 \n \n \n \n(11) DS with derived order (= 3b) in Androutsopoulou\u2019s account \n \nDP \nD AP \nto A DefP \nDef meghalo \nto \nAP \nA DefP \nDef petrino \nto \nNP \nspiti \nDP \nD AP \nto \nA \nmeghalo \nDefP \nDef \nto \nAP \nA \nDefP \nDef \npetrino \nto \nNP \nspiti \nDef ' \nt \n  \n15 \n \nAndroutsopoulou\u2019s analysis can capture all the different orderings under (3) \neither with a series of movement operations to the highest SpecDefP or to \nSpecDP, or with the possibility to merge the two adjectives in different \norders.  \n Even so, the question of what drives such XP movement operations \nremains unresolved; besides this, the analysis leaves a number of open \nquestions regarding the nature of Def: \na. What happens in cases such as (6), where articles (\u2018Def heads\u2019) can \nbe missing? \nb. Why are Def heads morphologically identical to Ds (unlike, for \ninstance, Scandinavian D den and the definite suffix \u2013en)? \nc. How is their [def] feature, a syntactic and not a semantic one, \ninterpreted at LF, especially in view of the predicative \/ restrictive \ninterpretation of DS? \nd. Are Def heads present in other syntactic environments in Greek?11 \n3.2. Alexiadou & Wilder (1998) \nAn account in a different vein is that by Alexiadou and Wilder (1998), who \ntake the predicative \/ restrictive interpretation of DS as their starting point. \nThey go on to analyse DS as reduced relative clauses, as predicative \nstructures. The analysis for relative clauses they adopt is the one in Kayne \n(1994), namely that relative clauses are made up from a D head taking a CP \n  \n16 \n \n(clausal) complement: [DP Dthe [CP [NP stone house]j [Cthat [IP I saw tj]]]]. \nHence, Alexiadou and Wilder\u2019s proposed structure for DS is that of a \nreduced relative clause, complete with an embedded full CP: \n \n(12) [DP D [CP APi [C \u2205 [IP \u03b1 ti ]]]] \n \n At the heart of DS there is an IP structure with an AP predicated of a \nsubject \u03b1. The predicate AP moves to the SpecCP, adjacent to D, and the \norder D-A-\u03b1 obtains. Now, the surface order of constituents depends on the \nidentity of the subject \u03b1. Thus, if \u03b1 is a simple DP, then a \u2018basic\u2019 D-A-D-N \norder ensues, as in to meghalo to spiti in (13) below. Movement of the \nsubject to spiti to a higher position, such as SpecDP, yields the D-N-D-A \norder. \nWhen the subject \u03b1 is a DS structure itself, then recursion follows, \nyielding [DP D [CP APi [C \u2205 [IP [DP D [CP APj [C \u2205 [IP DP tj ]]]] ti ]]]], e.g. to \nmeghalo to petrino to spiti. By way of illustration, consider the phrase \nmarker for to meghalo to spiti in (13) below. \n \n(13) D-A-D-N as [DP D [CP APi [C \u2205 [IP DP ti ]]]] \n \n  \n17 \n \nDP\nD CP\nAP C'\nC IP\nDP I'\nI AP\nto\nmeghalo\n\u2205\n\u2205\nto spiti\nt\n \n In order to account for word order variations, the analysis allows the \nembedded subject to spiti to move to the highest position using the \nspecifiers of the respective DPs as escape hatches. Alexiadou and Wilder\u2019s \nproposal has the virtue of acknowledging both the restrictive interpretation \nand the predicative nature of DS, plausibly capturing them as resulting from \nthe presence of a reduced relative inside a DP. At the same time, the \nstructure proposed is quite complex in the crucial sense that it radically \ndiffers from that of \u2018monadic\u2019 DPs: Alexiadou and Wilder posit a verbless \nclause in the complement of D as well as a set of constraints and movement \n  \n18 \n \noperations lacking clear motivation. Furthermore, under this analysis, D-A-\nD-N appears to be the default order with D-N-D-A order as the derived one, \nresulting from a further movement operation to the specifier of the matrix \nDP. However, there is no evidence that either D-A-D-N or D-N-D-A \nconstitutes a default order.12 \n3.3. Giusti (2003) \nGiusti\u2019s analysis is similar to Alexiadou & Wilder\u2019s \u2013 but without the \nproposed structure containing a CP constituent. In this account, the D-A is a \nconstituent, more specifically, an AP agreeing for definiteness. This \nagreeing AP is generated at the specifier of a YP situated between D and N, \nwhere all APs are taken to be merged. The D-N-D-A order is derived by \nmovement of the N head over the AP to a higher head position X, as shown \nin (14) below, an operation that could be claimed to take place for \nindependent purposes (Cinque, 1994). The D-A-D-N order is derived by a \nfurther optional XP movement operation of the \u2018definite\u2019 AP (D-A) to the \nspecifier of DP. \n \n(14) Giusti\u2019s account \n  \n19 \n \n \nDP \nD \nD' \nXP \nX YP \nAP Y ' \nY \nto \n\u2205 \nto meghalo \nspiti \nN \nt \n \nOne of the consequences is that the D-N-D-A order is again \npostulated to be the basic one, something that is in tune with the situation in \nSemitic and the situation in older forms of Greek \u2013 as noted in footnote 12 \u2013 \nbut unmotivated for Modern Greek. The D-A-D-N order is also argued to \ninvolve SpecDP, a position that has independently been shown to be \nparticularly \u2018active\u2019 in Greek (see also section 4.2). \nGiusti\u2019s analysis however does not account for the special restrictive \n\/ predicative interpretation of DS, as such an interpretive effect does not \nseem to have anything to do with the categories X and Y. Another issue is \n  \n20 \n \nwith the status of the N-to-X movement, posited in Cinque (1994) to \naccount for the Noun-Adjective orders in Romance. When it comes to \nwhether this operation takes place in Greek, opinions are split between \na) this head-movement operation being short-distance, overtly \ntargeting a much lower head, Num, right above the (nP-)NP shell \n(Panagiotidis, 2000) and \nb) such a head-movement operation not existing at all in the \nlanguage (Alexiadou & Stavrou, 1998), see Stavrou (1996) for discussion. \n3.4. Campos & Stavrou (2004) \nThe analysis of Determiner Spreading in Campos & Stavrou (2004) builds \non that of Alexiadou & Wilder (1998). Besides doing away with the \nproposal of a reduced CP at the heart of a DS structure, the main merits of \nCampos & Stavrou\u2019s analysis are \na) clearly establishing the predicative nature of Determiner Spreading, \nharking back not only to Alexiadou & Wilder (1998) but also to \nManolessou (2000), and \nb) identifying the second Determiner in a DS as the predication \noperator itself. \nA further advantage is their identifying the existence of Determiner \nSpreading as a predicative structure in languages beyond Greek: Aromanian \n(a Southern Balkan Romance language), Albanian \u2013 with some \n  \n21 \n \nmorphological complications \u2013 and Romanian. They also argue that the D-\nN-D-A order is the base one and that in these orders the adjective is a \npredicative AP. Finally, they consider the D-N element as a complex head, \nin accordance to what is argued for Balkan languages like Albanian, \nMacedonian, Bulgarian, Aromanian and Romanian, where articles are \naffixal. However, to spiti as a complex head in Greek \u2013 as illustrated in (15) \nbelow \u2013 is significantly harder to justify on independent grounds; we just \nnote this issue without further discussing it here. \n \n(15) Campos & Stavrou\u2019s account (irrelevant details omitted) \n \nDP \nD PredP \n pro Pred \nPred AP \nto spiti\n to \n petrino \n Foc \n FocP \n \nNow, D-A-D-N orders result as follows (Campos & Stavrou 2004: 163): \n\u201cthe presence of pro [\u2026] seems to block movement of the AP to [Spec, \nFocP]. Thus head-movement is the only option to reach FocP. The adjective \nmoves as a head from A to Pred (picking up the determiner) [\u2026] to D \n  \n22 \n \n(incorporating to the [D-N compound] head) [\u2026] and then it excorporates to \nFoc\u201d. Therefore, like in all other analyses of DS so far, an asymmetry \nbetween the two basic word orders for DS is posited, with D-A-D-N orders \nresulting from movement of adjectival material to a nominal Foc(us) \nprojection. However, D-A-D-N orders can hardly be said to have a focus \nreading, even more so one absent in D-N-D-A orders. Moreover an \nasymmetry between D-N-D-A and D-A-D-N orders cannot be empirically \nmotivated, either, as we will see in sections 4.5 and 4.6. What is more, \nCampos and Stavrou propose \u2013 as is the case in all the other accounts \u2013 that \nthe structure of monadic DPs is fundamentally different from that of DS: for \ninstance, they take the N in DS to form a complex head with the first D, \nunder the high D node, as in (15). Finally, we will take issue with their \narguing that the adjective in DS is a predicative AP and show the empirical \nadvantages of moving away from such a thesis. In general, as this analysis \ndiffers only to a small degree from the one presented in this paper \u2013 however \ncrucially \u2013 we will be comparing the two approaches throughout the rest of \nthis paper. \n \n4 AN ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS \n \nWe will now present an account that captures the predicative nature of DS \nwhile accounting for the word order facts with a minimum of assumptions, \n  \n23 \n \nactually taking the fact that DS has a restrictive \/ predicative interpretation \nas our point of departure. In order to achieve our goal, we will not argue for \na restrictive relative clause. Instead, we will claim that DS is a DP \npredication structure, in a vein similar to that of Campos & Stavrou (2004). \nUnlike them, however, we will not argue for a PredP constituent inside DS \nconstituents. \n \n4.1. DS and its kin \n Introduced in section 2.2, the relation between the restrictive and the \npredicative interpretations of DS is in need of further elucidation in the form \nof examples (16-17) below. In these examples we will try to illustrate that a \nD-A constituent can stand as an elliptical DP in predicative environments \nwith a copula, but not within a relative clause. As judgements are subtle, \ncontexts are provided. \n \n(16) Context: The personnel of an institute consists of researchers \n(\u2018erevnites\u2019) and teaching staff. In this particular institute some of the \npersonnel are competent and some are incompetent. A number of \npeople have just left the institute and someone comments: \n(a) i   erevnites i ikani         efighan.  DS \n  the researchers   the        competent    left \n  \n24 \n \n (b) i erevnites pu itan (??i) ikani efighan. restr. rel \n  the researchers that were the competent left.  \n \u2018The researchers who were the competent ones left.   \n (c) i erevnites itan i ikani. with copula  \n  the researchers were the competent \n \u2018The researchers were the competent ones.\u2019 \n (17) Context: The job selection process in company X is a two-day long \nprocess; it involves both a lot of waiting (\u2018anamoni\u2019) and \nparticipating in different meetings, interviews etc. in different \nlocations far apart from each other.  The two days are over and the \nprocess has just finished. A candidate says to another: \n(a)  ?i anamoni i eknevristiki elixe. DS \n  the wait the irritating finished \n (b) i anamoni pu itan (*i) eknevristiki elixe. restr. rel  \n  the wait that was the irritating finished \n \u2018The wait, which was the irritating thing, finished. \u2019 \n (c) ?i anamoni itan i eknevristiki. with copula  \n  the wait was the irritating \n \u2018The wait was the irritating thing.\u2019 \n \n Let us clarify examples (16-17) above. In (16) an adjective combines \nwith the concrete noun erevnitis (\u2018researcher\u2019) in three distinct \n  \n25 \n \nenvironments, whereas in (17) with a deverbal \/ event noun, anamoni \n(\u2018wait\u2019). The environments respectively, as already mentioned, are: \n \n1. Determiner Spreading: (16a), (17a). \n2. Restrictive relatives with a referential predicate, characterising a \nreferential \u2018head\u2019 (cf. the man who was the responsible one has fled): \n(16b), (17b). \n3. A copular structure with a DP predicate of the D-A form; this is the \nstandard way of expressing noun ellipsis in Greek; therefore i ikani \nsimply means \u2018the competent ones\u2019, see also section 4.6. \n \n In (16), the combination of D-A i ikani (\u2018the competent ones\u2019) with a \nconcrete noun is possible in (16a) and (16c), but very deviant within a \nrestrictive relative. Similarly, turning to (17) we observe along with \nManolessou (2000: Ch.4) that DS is anomalous with deverbal nouns such as \nanamoni (\u2018wait\u2019) (17a).13 Nevertheless, (17a) and (17c) are once more much \nbetter than (17b), where D-A i eknevristiki (\u2018the irritating one\u2019) is embedded \nwithin a relative clause. Concerning (17a) in particular, it indeed sounds \nquite odd unless properly contextualised; however, it is anything but \ngrammatically marginal, a fact also indicated by the multitude of hits that \nGoogle searches for \u201cD-A \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u201d (\u2018is\u2019) and \u201c\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 D-A.\u201d yield. Finally, (16b) \n  \n26 \n \nand (17b) are perfect when the predicate they involve is not referential (e.g. \nwithout the article).14 \n In other words, a D-A constituent seems incompatible with \nrestrictive relative contexts, although it works fine as part of Determiner \nSpreading and as the elliptical DP (\u2018referential\u2019) predicate inside copular \npredication structures. This is particularly instructive because if, as in \nAlexiadou & Wilder (1998), DS syntactically involved a reduced relative \nclause, then we would not expect the contrast in acceptability between \nDeterminer Spreading and relatives with D-A. \nMore importantly, and as is made clear especially in (16c) and (17c) \nabove, DS does not consist of an AP constituent with an adjective agreeing \nfor definiteness, as argued in previous analyses, but a D-A constituent that is \nan elliptical DP. This is why in the aforementioned examples these can be \nused as referential predicates, although no overt noun is present. The fact \nthat D-A constituents are elliptical DPs is also evident from the translations \nof these examples: cf. the translation of (16c) as \u2018The researchers were the \ncompetent ones\u2019. We will return to this matter in section 4.6. \n4.2. The Determiner in Determiner Spreading \n DS has been shown to be a predicative relation, more specifically, a \nrelation between a DP subject and a DP predicate. In other words, the \nrelationship between constituents like to spiti and to meghalo in to meghalo \n  \n27 \n \nto spiti is that of a DP predicate to its subject. Hence, and deferring \ndiscussion of the nature of the elliptical DP to meghalo until section 4.6, our \nproposed configuration for DS can be either: \n \n(18) [DP [DP-subject to meghalo] [D' to spiti]] \n or \n [DP [DP-subject to spiti] [D' to meghalo]] \n \n(19) Phrase marker for [DP [DP-subject to meghalo] [D' to spiti]] \n \n The idea that Determiner Spreading contains two constituents with \none of them in SpecDP, belongs to Horrocks & Stavrou (1986).15 This is \ntaken to be a predicative configuration, where the DP in SpecDP acts as the \nsubject within the DP containing it. The general idea is, in principle, in \nconcord with theories of syntactic predication such as Stowell\u2019s (1981) \nDP \nDP \nD' \nD N \nto megalo \nto spiti \n  \n28 \n \n\u2018small clause\u2019 analysis, the small clause being the whole DP here, and \nWilliams\u2019 (1994) subject-in-Spec configuration for predication. As in \nCampos & Stavrou (2004), the D head of the larger constituent acts as the \npredication operator, the second to (of \u2018to spiti\u2019) in the example (19) above. \n The above would lead us to a paradoxical situation wherein the D \nheading the DS constituent (the \u2018predicate\u2019 one) is also the predication \noperator: the D heading the whole DS constituent would be referential and \npredicative at the same time. However, D heads of \u2018monadic\u2019 DPs hardly \ndisplay any predicative properties; moreover there is a lot of evidence that \nthe SpecDP of \u2018monadic\u2019 DPs is an A' position reserved for DP-internal \nfoci, topics (Horrocks & Stavrou, 1987) and demonstratives (Stavrou & \nHorrocks, 1989; Campbell, 1996; Panagiotidis, 2000) in Greek; the specifier \nof monadic DPs can also serve as an escape hatch for DP-internal wh-words. \n Summarising, we are claiming here that while the D in monadic DPs \nis just referential, with its specifier being an A' position, the D relating two \nDPs in DS appears to possess both referential and predicative properties, \nwith its specifier hosting the subject of predication, hence an A-position.16 \n There are three ways to resolve this paradox. A first one, from \nPanagiotidis (2008) is the only slightly different analysis that there is a \nvariety of Determiner (let\u2019s call it Dpred for lack of a more suitable label) in \nGreek bearing (an) interpretable feature(s) that enable(s) it to mediate in a \npredicative relation between its specifier (the subject of predication) and the \n  \n29 \n \nNP in its complement. Hence, Dpred to would differ from its homophonous \n(in Greek) D to, which is only referential, in bearing (an) additional \ninterpretable feature(s) making it also predicative. Note here that the \nhomophony between Dpred and D would be a morphological accident of \nGreek, if something along the lines of Campos & Stavrou (2004) is correct, \nnamely that, for instance, Romanian cel is a genuine instance of Dpred. \n A second solution, one that better matches the semantics of DS as \nunderstood here, would be along the following lines: when a DP is merged \nas the specifier of a DP constituent, the predicative interpretation \ncharacteristic of DS is triggered. On the other hand, when a D-like \nconstituent is copied from within the DP and merges with D, no such \ninterpretation is possible, and the moved material at SpecDP is in an A'-\nposition. This hypothetical state of affairs is illustrated below:  \n(20) DP2 at SpecDP externally merged \u0001 subject of predication \n DP \neo \nDP2 D' \neo \nD NP \n(21) DP2 at SpecDP copied from within NP \u0001 in an A'-position \n DP \neo \nDP2 D' \neo \nD NP \n6 \n \u2026DP2\u2026 \n  \n30 \n \n \n   A third analysis, would have us split DP into at least a \u2018nominal C\u2019 \nand \u2018a nominal Infl\u2019 layer. DS would then target the specifier of this \n\u2018nominal Infl\u2019, which could be equated to Campos & Stavrou\u2019s (2004) \nnominal Pred category, whereas the \u2018nominal C\u2019 position would still act as \nan A' position. See, once more, Horrocks & Stavrou (1987) as well as Giusti \n(1995) for D as a nominal Inflection (hence SpecDP as an A position), while \nCampbell (1996) and Den Dikken (2001) contain some further discussion.17 \nAccording to this line of thinking, the availability of SpecDP in Greek as \nboth an A' position for operators (demonstratives, focused genitives) and \ntopics and as an A position for subjects of predication would in fact \nconstitute evidence for two D projections. This is not as easy to establish as \none might think: for instance, non-dislocated possessors are always \npostnominal in Greek, unlike the English \u201cTom\u2019s diner\u201d. Furthermore, it is \nalso true that, for some speakers, wh-extraction out of a DP with DS is much \nworse than extraction from a monadic DP, as in (22) below. This would \nsuggest that SpecDP can host a subject, as an A position, while \nsimultaneously blocking an A' operation, wh-extraction. Still, the evidence \nis not that clear-cut to argue for a single D-layer. Consequently, it is hard at \nthis point to decide between the accounts outlined above. \n(22) a.    ? tinosi ides [to petrino spiti ti]? \n  whose saw.2ndPL the of.stone house \n  \n31 \n \n b.  ?* tinos ides [to petrino to spiti ti]? \n  whose saw.2ndPL the of.stone the house \n  \u2018Whose stone house did you see?\u2019 \nRelated to the above is the question of why DS is unavailable in \nRomance languages, where elliptical DPs with adjectives (\u2018D-A\u2019), and noun \nellipsis in general, are also available.18 In brief, why are DP predicative \nstructures only possible in Greek and related languages, as far as we know? \nDepending on our choice of analysis this could be either down to \na) unavailability of Dpred category in Romance; this is what Campos & \nStavrou (2004) and Panagiotidis (2008) would suggest; \nb) the interpretive component in Romance being indifferent to the \nderivational history of SpecDP and thus unable to interpret it as a \nsubject-of-predication; \nc) Romance DPs being single-layered.19 \nWe hope that further research will resolve which of the three ways of \nunderstanding the predicative structure of DS is empirically superior. \n4.3. The nature of the DS subject \nIt is now important to clarify a problem concerning the nature of the DS \nsubject.20 Although the predicate in DS is referential, nothing in principle \nwould prevent indefinite subjects or bare (plural) subjects from showing up \n  \n32 \n \nin SpecDP, yielding instances of DS like in examples (1b) and (2b), repeated \nbelow as (23). \n(23) a. *(*Ena) spiti to meghalo \n  a \/ one house the big  \n b. *(*Ena) meghalo to spiti. \n  a \/ one big the house \nThe ungrammaticality of (23) can be traced back to the peculiarities of \nGreek subjects. First of all, Greek generally does not tolerate bare plurals as \nsubjects. In generic sentences, for instance, subjects have to be headed by \nthe definite article;21 in this respect Greek resembles Italian as discussed in \nLongobardi (1994). The same holds for any nominal constituent not headed \nby the definite article, e.g. non-focused preverbal mass or abstract nouns in \nthe singular, such as xronos (\u2018time\u2019). Actually, the only way to force \npreverbal sentential subjects headed by the null indefinite article in Greek is \nby D-linking them, and this almost exclusively in the journalese register. \nFurthermore, DPs headed by the null indefinite determiner are absolutely \nunacceptable as subjects of small clauses, as exemplified in the context of a \ncopular sentence (24a) and in that of a consider-construction (25a). \nInterestingly, indefinite subjects headed by the \u2018indefinite article\u2019 enas, mia, \nena (\u2018a \/ one\u2019), are also out as subjects of sentences (24b) and small clauses \n(25b), unless interpreted as numerals or as D-linked \/ specific.22 \n \n  \n33 \n \n(24) a. *(O) xronos ine politimos. \n  The time is valuable. \n  \u2018Time is valuable.\u2019 \n b. Mia falena ine orea. \n  one whale is pretty \n  \u2018One \/ a (specific) \/ *a whale is pretty.\u2019 \n(25) a. Theori [*(ton) kafe vlavero] \n  considers the coffee harmful \n  \u2018She \/ he considers coffee harmful.\u2019 \n b.  ? Theori [enan kinigho fonia] \n  considers one hunter killer \n  \u2018S\/he considers one \/ a (specific) \/ *a hunter a killer.\u2019 \n \nIndefinite subjects with enas, mia, ena are much better in sentences, (24b) \nand (25b), than in small clauses, (24a) and (25a). This is probably a \u2018Diesing \neffect\u2019 (Diesing 1992): maybe small clauses do not contain (enough) \nstructure in a \u2018Discourse Domain\u2019 (Grohmann 2003) for their subject to \nraise into so as to get a specific reading \u2013 contrary to what happens in full \nclauses. Therefore, specific interpretation of indefinite subjects with enas, \nmia, ena is impossible to license syntactically either because of the \ndeficiency of, say, the small clause\u2019s discourse-complementiser field or \nbecause small clauses have no discourse-complementiser field. In any case, \n  \n34 \n \nDPs definitely lack a complementiser field, hence we predict such generic \nand indefinite subjects to be impossible in the SpecDP \u2013 in Determiner \nSpreading, in other words. \n An important point in our analysis is that it does not postulate any \nmovement operations: the subject DP merges directly with the predicate DP, \nin its specifier. Because any DP can be a predicate and of course any \n\u2018definite\u2019 DP, being itself referential, can be a subject, the ordering of DPs \nappears to be free in DS, although in each case different base-generated \npredicates describe different base-generated subjects. So, in [DP [DP-subject to \nmeghalo] [D' to spiti]], the meaning is roughly \u2018the big one which is the \nhouse\u2019, or similar, whereas [DP [DP-subject to spiti] [D' to meghalo]] means \nsomething along the lines of \u2018the house which is the big one\u2019. The difference \nis subtle, but present. Still, this is not the whole story: more needs to be said \nabout the nature of the elliptical DPs, of which we see only the determiner \nand the adjective. This is the focus of Section 4.6. \n4.4. DS without ellipsis? \nBefore moving on, let us briefly address a valid question, that is, whether \nDS can involve two DPs neither of which is elliptical. The answer is yes, at \nleast in Greek. Examples include the following (adapted from Stavrou-\nSifaki, 1995: 218 \u2013 see also Campos & Stavrou, 2004):23 \n \n  \n35 \n \n(26) (a) o Solomos o piitis. \n  the Solomos the poet \n \u2018Solomos the poet.\u2019 \n (b) o aetos to puli. \n  the eagle the bird \n \u2018Eagle, the bird.\u2019 \n (c) esis i nei kalitehnes. \n  you the young artists \n \u2018You young artists.\u2019 \n \n In (26a), a proper name DP combines with another one; in (26b) two \ndefinite DPs combine together; in (26c) it is a pronoun and a definite DP. \nThe semantic interpretation of all the examples in (26) is almost identical to \nthat of DS, involving predication between DPs. Stavrou-Sifaki (1995) dubs \nthe phenomenon illustrated above epexegesis and she teases it apart from \napposition, which inter alia forces an intonation break between the two DPs. \nShe moreover offers a very similar analysis to ours, also unifying epexegesis \nwith Determiner Spreading, a claim reconfirmed in Campos & Stavrou \n(2004). Therefore, by extending our analysis to epexegesis, we would \nrepresent (26c), for instance, as  [DP [DP-subject esis] [D' i nei kalitehnes]] (\u2018you \nyoung artists\u2019). Details aside, DP predication is anything but a phenomenon \nrestricted to just D-A sequences. DPs with referential predication are run-of-\n  \n36 \n \nthe-mill in Greek; labels such as \u2018DS\u2019 or \u2018epexegesis\u2019 are merely \ndescriptive, evocative of the type of constituents involved.24  \n4.5. Deriving the interpretive effects \nWe already saw in example (8) in section 2.2, and throughout the discussion \nin this section, that Determiner Spreading can have a restrictive reading, i.e. \npick out proper subsets from the superset described by its predicate DP. At \nthe same time, we also encountered the availability of predicative readings \nfor DS. How are the two related to each other? Although the semantics of \nthe structure is actually beyond the scope of this contribution, an informal \nsketch will be provided here for exposition. \n Let us start with the difference between the interpretation of DS and \nthat of an adjectivally modified \u2018monadic\u2019 DP, which can be expressed as \nfollows: the interpretation of DS arises from the intersection of two sets, \neach described by a \u2018monadic\u2019 DPs, a subject and a predicate; DS is the \nintersection of two already restricted sets. More specifically: call S' the set \nof the stone things as described by the elliptical DP \u2018ta petrina\u2019 (\u2018the stone \nones\u2019) and H' the set of the houses as described by the DP \u2018ta spitia\u2019 (\u2018the \nhouses\u2019). Membership of these sets S' and H' is not only restricted by the \nconcepts the adjective petrina and the noun spitia denote, but also by the \nrespective Determiners ta and whatever else a Greek DP, such as Num, \n  \n37 \n \ncontains. Determiner Spreading, a predication relation, is interpreted as the \nintersection of the two sets: \n (27) |[ta petrina ta spitia]| = S' \u2229 H' \n Now we need to derive the restrictive reading of DS, which, as \nclaimed here, is a subcase of the predicative one. This task can be carried \nout as follows: recall that membership of the sets S' and H' is not only \nrestricted by the concepts their respective lexical material (adjective and \nnoun) denotes, but also by their determiners, Num heads and so on.25 Now, \ngiven the various contextual factors conspiring with syntactic structure to \nyield the extension of (definite or other) DPs, it may happen that one of the \nsets, let\u2019s say the subject DP\u2019s extension, is a proper subset of the other one, \nwith S' \u2282 H'; this is the restrictive interpretation of DS, the only \ninterpretation according to Kolliakou\u2019s Polydefiniteness Constraint (2004: \n272-276). Of course, in a situation where S' \u2282 H' holds, it is also trivially \ntrue that the whole S' is the intersection of itself with H'. Informally, a DP \nwith Determiner Spreading like ta petrina ta spitia can be interpreted either \npredicatively as \u2018the stone ones that have the property of being the houses\u2019, \nas from (27), or restrictively as \u2018the stone ones of the houses\u2019. Given that, a \nmonadic DP ta petrina spitia (\u2018the stone houses\u2019) can also have an \ninterpretation similar to that indicated in (27), the pragmatically preferred \nreading for DS, which contains more structure, is often the restrictive one, \npace matters of Focus and intonation. \n  \n38 \n \n To summarise, DS is a DP predication structure with a DP subject \npredicated over a DP predicate. The resulting relation, one of two sets \nintersecting, is the expected one. A subcase of this relation is when the \nintersection is one of the (sub)sets itself \u2013 this is the restrictive \ninterpretation. Crucially, we have taken for granted so far that D+A \nconstituents are DPs. The reasons why are explained in the next \nsubsection.26 \n \n4.6. The D+A constituent is an elliptical DP \nConstituents like to meghalo (\u2018the big one\u2019), far from being APs or \nlanguage-specific curiosities, are nothing but elliptical DPs comprising a \nsemantically (i.e. non-descriptive) and phonologically null noun eN (Kester, \n1996; Corver & Delfitto, 1999; Panagiotidis, 2002 and elsewhere).27 The \npresence of eN in a number of seemingly nounless DP constituents \nsyntactically licenses the determiner and provides a trivial predicate for it to \nrange over. Finally, despite its not denoting a concept, eN may mark other LF \ninterpretable features, such as gender (cf. Heim, 2008). \nWhat this means in our case is that the D-A constituent functions \nquasi-pronominally, it being an elliptical DP of the form [D to [FP [AP \npetrino] F [N eN]. So, the presence of an article before an adjective does not \n  \n39 \n \nconstitute a definiteness agreement marker on the adjective, exactly as it \ndoes not before the adjective ikani in (16c) either. \nThe resulting structures are given in (28) and (29) below. \n \n(28) D-A-D-N \nDP\nDP D'\nD N\nto spiti\nD\nto\nFP\nmeghalo\nAP F'\nN\neN\nF\n\u2205\n \n(29) D-N-D-A \n \nDP\n \nDP\n \nD\n \nN\n \nto\n \nspiti\n \nDP\n \nD\n \nto\n \nFP\n \nmeghalo\n \nAP\n F\n \n'\n \nN\n \ne\n N \nF\n \n\u2205 \n \nThis account is empirically superior to the ones arguing the adjective within \nDS to be an AP and we will argue for this concentrating on Campos & \n  \n40 \n \nStavrou (2004). Campos & Stavrou claim that the adjectival constituents \nwithin DS must be APs, as discussed in 3.4; adjectives in D-N-D-A orders \nbehave as full APs, while they head-move all the way to a highest Foc head \nin D-A-D-N orders. In support of this purported asymmetry, they cite the \nexamples below, their (51); judgements are theirs: \n \n(30) Adjective heads vs. APs? \n a. *to    toso \/  poli \/  pjo    oreo  to   vivlio  \n  the   so \/ very\/ more  nice  the book \nb.  to   vivlio   to    toso \/ poli \/   pjo      oreo \nthe  book    the  so \/   very   more   nice \n\u2018the very nice \/ nicer book\u2019 \nc. *i    perifani   gia  ta     pedia      tis     i     mana \n  the  proud of    the   children  her   the  mother \n d. i       mana      i      perifani gia   ta    pedia       tis   \n      the   mother the  proud     of    the  children   her \n    \u2018the mother proud of her children\u2019 \n \nAlthough they star examples (30a) and (30c), this is not a judgement other \nnative speakers share. To the extent that (30c) should be given a \u2018?\u2019, this \n  \n41 \n \nmust be attributed to parsing reasons, due to the subject DP i perifani gia ta \npedia tis (\u2018the proud of her children\u2019) being so much heavier than the DP \npredicate i mana (\u2018the mother\u2019) \u2013 not to an inability of the head-moved \nadjective perifani (\u2018proud\u2019) to pied-pipe its argument to the Focus domain. \nNow, in (30a) the difference in heaviness between the DP subject to toso \noreo (\u2018the so nice\u2019) and its DP predicate to vivlio (\u2018the book\u2019) is much \nsmaller, and this is why the said parsing effect is virtually imperceptible \n(and very far from deserving a star), in this case. At the end of the day, what \nthe examples in (30) actually show is that D-N-D-A structures are indeed \nsymmetrical to D-A-D-N ones and that the same D-A constituent is at play \nin both orders. \n This takes us to whether this D-A constituent is an AP or, as argued \nhere, an elliptical DP with an adjective. Campos & Stavrou (2004: 162-3) \nargue it to be a predicative AP on the basis of intensional adjectives (31a), \ncircumstantial adjectives (31b) and adjectives that form part of a A+N \ncompound (31c) being banned in DS \u2013 see also Manolessou (2000: Ch. 4). \nThese are illustrated in the example below \u2013 adapted from example (49) in \nCampos & Stavrou (2004): \n \n(31) Which adjectives are banned from DS? \n a. *o     tromokratis  o     ipotithemenos  \nthe  terrorist        the   alleged  \n  \n42 \n \nb. *o      proedros   o       proin \nthe  president   the   former \n c. ?to   astiko  to   leoforio \n   the   urban  the  bus (urban bus) \n \n (32) How do the above D-A constituents fare as referential predicates? \n a. *o tromokratis ine [o ipotithemenos] \nthe terrorist is the alleged  \n\u2018The terrorist is the alleged one\u2019. \nb. *o proedros ine [o proin] \nthe president ine the former \n\u2018The president is the former one\u2019 \nc. ?to leoforio ine [to astiko] \n  the bus is the urban \n \u2018The bus is the urban one.\u2019 \n \nExample (31) illustrates Campos & Stavrou\u2019s claim that in D-N-D-A orders \nthe \u2018A\u2019 is of a predicative character, a predicative AP. We agree that (31c) is \nmarked and that the presence of intensional and circumstantial adjectives \n(31a-b) is ungrammatical in DS. However, looking at (32), we notice that \nelliptical DPs with intensional (32a) and circumstantial (32b) adjectives are \n  \n43 \n \nalso impossible as referential predicates in a copular environment. This \nsuggests that the argument can go either way: whatever bans these two \nclasses of adjectives from within DS also bans them from being referential \npredicates in copular configurations. In other words, they are banned from \nDS not (necessarily) because DS involves predicative APs. \n \n4.7. Deriving the word orders \nA serious issue with most of the previous syntactic accounts is deriving the \nfull set of different word orders described in section 2 without \novergenerating. Despite the fact that recursion can probably do the trick for \nthe evidence presented under (3) in Alexiadou & Wilder\u2019s (1998) and \nGiusti\u2019s (2003) analyses, accounting for the grammaticality of (3) and (6) as \nopposed to (5) \u2013 repeated below for convenience \u2013 can be less \nstraightforward. \n \n(3) (a) To meghalo to petrino to spiti. \n  the big the of.stone the house \n (b) To meghalo to spiti to petrino. \n  the big the house the of.stone \n (c) To petrino to spiti to meghalo. \n  the of.stone the house the big \n  \n44 \n \n (d) To petrino to meghalo to spiti \n  the of.stone the big the house \n (e) To spiti to meghalo to petrino. \n  the house the big the of.stone \n (f) To spiti to petrino to meghalo. \n  the house the of.stone the big \n \u2018The big stone house.\u2019  \n(5) (a)     *To spiti meghalo to petrino. \n  The house big the of.stone \n (b)    *To spiti to meghalo petrino. \n  The house the big of.stone \n\u2018The big stone house.\u2019 \n(6) (a) To meghalo to petrino spiti. \n  The big the of.stone house \n (b) To meghalo spiti to petrino. \n  The big house the of.stone \n  \u2018The big stone house.\u2019 \n \n In (3), we saw that all the combinatorial possibilities (six in the case \nof two adjectives and a noun) for DS are grammatical if an article precedes \neach lexical element of the constituent. In this case, three DPs are contained \nin the DS constituent, a DP itself. One of them, informally the rightmost, is \n  \n45 \n \nthe DP predicate, say to meghalo eN in (3c). Its subject is yet another DS \nconstituent, to petrino eN to spiti, which in its own turn is made of a DP \npredicate to spiti, and its subject to petrino eN. This state of affairs is \ndepicted in (33) below, where the structure of (3c) is given. It is hence worth \nnoting here that the word order \u2018freedom\u2019 displayed in (3) is by no means an \nindication of non-configurationality but, rather, the result of DPs (including \nDPs displaying DS) being free to function as subjects. \n \n(33) DS with two adjectives (or \u2018the effects of recursion\u2019) \n \n In the account presented here, the contrast between (5) and (6) can \nalso be satisfactorily captured with no added assumptions. In (6), two DPs, \none subject and one referential predicate, are involved in DS and nothing \nD1' \nD1 \nto \nFP \nmeghalo \nAP F ' \nN \ne N \nF \n\u2205 \nD3P \nD3 \nto \nFP \npetrino \nAP F ' \nN \ne N \nF \n\u2205 \nD2P \nD2' \nD2 \nto\nN \nspiti \nD1P \n  \n46 \n \nprevents either or both of them to possess a more complex structure, such as \none including adjectives, demonstratives, possessors and so on. The \nexamples in (6) illustrate only one of these options, namely the non-elliptical \nDP involving an AP. So, (6a) is analysed as [DP [DP-subject to meghalo eN] [D' \nto petrino spiti]] and (6b) as [DP [DP-subject to meghalo spiti] [D' to petrino eN]] \n\u2013 see also (28) and (29). \n Turning to (5) now, if the article to marks the boundaries between \nthe DPs in DS, the ungrammaticality of (5a) becomes obvious, as it would \ntake the ungrammatical DP *to spiti meghalo as subject. However, *to spiti \nmeghalo is a DP displaying the D-N-A order, which we already saw in (4b) \nto be banned in Greek. As for the unacceptability of (5b), we wish to note \nthat an elliptical DP with two, as opposed to one, APs is not permitted \neither, anyway. This is already discussed for English in Sadler & Arnold \n(1994). Whatever the principled explanation is, this entails that (5b) is \nungrammatical because it contains the ungrammatical elliptical DP *to \nmeghalo petrino eN as its DP predicate. \n Before wrapping this section up, let us comment that our analysis \nhelps shed light on the observation made by Manolessou (2000: Ch. 4) on \nthe frequency of DS. After a corpus study of written Modern Greek, she \nclaims that DS is found in informal texts and written texts emulating speech \nmore frequently than in texts representing a higher register or style. This is a \npotentially serious problem if, as according to all the previous analyses, DS \n  \n47 \n \ncontains more complex structure than monadic DPs. On the other hand, in \nour analysis, this is a fact that can be captured along the lines of parsing \neffort. To wit, a DP with Determiner Spreading typically consists of at least \ntwo monadic DPs, with one of them elliptical. This means that a number of \nmodifiers can be packaged within a single DS structure, as in examples (3), \n(6), but also (30). Of course, it is also perfectly possible to package a \nnumber of modifiers within monadic DPs: a monadic DP with two \nadjectives in (4a) \u2013 repeated below \u2013 is absolutely fine. \n(4) (a) To meghalo petrino spiti. \n  The big of.stone house \nHaving said that, choosing DS to package more than one modifier presents \nthe added advantage that every instance of the article marks the boundary of \na new DP subconstituent, making parsing easier. If this line of reasoning is \non the right track, then we can probably explain why we find DS more \ncommonly in speech, where parsing takes place in real time only, especially \nwith nouns taking two modifiers or more. The parsing differences between \n\u2018monadic\u2019 and DS DPs is therefore an interesting topic for future research. \n \n5 CONCLUSION \n \nWe have offered a novel account of Determiner Spreading in Greek \nsuggesting it be unified with epexegesis, along the lines of Stavrou-Sifaki \n  \n48 \n \n(1995), with both phenomena being instances of DP predication. The \nanalysis presented here has a number of advantages over previous ones. First \nof all, it explains the \u2018free\u2019 distribution between D-A-D-N and D-N-D-A in \nDS. It also captures all the different orders in (3) and (6), while excluding \n(5), without introducing novel assumptions. The restrictive interpretation of \nthe phenomenon is argued to be a pragmatically induced subcase of its \npredicative function. DS is conceived as a subject-predicate configuration, a \nrelation between a SpecXP (the subject) and a predicate: no special \nfunctional categories are postulated, no reduced relative CPs are understood \nto be embedded within the DP, no unidentified categories are required and, \nto the extent this is a goal, no movement operations (and their triggers) are \nnecessary. \nMost crucially in terms of methodological parsimony and \ncommitment to Occam\u2019s Razor, DS has clearly been shown not to be a \nparticular construction, a configuration at the periphery of grammar. On the \ncontrary, it has been argued to occur when elliptical DPs are involved in \nreferential predication and, essentially, to be identical to epexegesis: LF can \nsee both the highest category (D) and the internal structure (subject-\npredicate) thereof and interprets both accordingly. \n \nREFERENCES \n  \n49 \n \nABNEY, S.

Nevertheless, all errors, omissions and \nmisconceptions are to be credited to the co-authors. \n1\n To the best of our knowledge, the term \u2018Determiner Spreading\u2019 was introduced by \nAndroutsopoulou (1994). We prefer this neutral term over the more recent \u2018polydefinite\u2019 \n(Kolliakou 2003; 2004), because Greek \u2018definite\u2019 determiners (the o, i, to paradigm) are not \nexclusively definite in interpretation: Giannakidou & Stavrou (1999) have shown the Greek \n\u2018definite\u2019 article to be an intensionalisation operator. Expectedly, Determiner Spreading is \nnot a definite construction: for instance, it is possible with a generic reading. We will \nnevertheless continue using \u2018D\u2019, \u2018(definite) determiner\u2019 and \u2018(definite) article\u2019 throughout \nthis paper to refer to the o, i, to paradigm. Regarding the Greek \u2018indefinite determiner\u2019, we \nwill have very little to say about it, as this never occurs in DS structures and it does not \nuncontroversially belong to the syntactic category of Determiner. \n2\n See Manolessou (2000: Ch. 4) for a detailed description and discussion. \n3\n Articles and related markers appear in boldface throughout this section. \n4\n FUT= \u201cfuture\u201d; SUBJ= \u201csubjunctive\u201d. Example adapted from Kolliakou (2004: 270). \nDiscussion here follows Kolliakou (1998; 2004) and Manolessou (2000: Ch. 4). \n5\n We return to this observation in section 4.5. \n6\n See Kolliakou (2004) on the relevance of prosody in disambiguating Greek DPs. \n7\n A further piece of evidence potentially supporting the relevance of predication in DS is the \nfact that only intersective adjectives can participate in it as Richard Larson (p.c.) pointed \nout. Very interestingly, DS with epithets such as murlos (\u2018nutter\u2019), kopanos (\u2018blockhead\u2019) \n  \n58 \n \n                                                                                                                         \nand so on is interpreted predicatively and never as restrictive. We leave this open, as \nrelatively little is understood about the position, referential properties (but see Lasnik 1991) \nand feature-makeup of epithets. The interested reader is referred to the discussion in section \n4.6, Manolessou (2000: Ch. 4) and Campos & Stavrou (2004). \n8\n As the analysis here heavily builds on the one in Marinis & Panagiotidis (2001), we will \nnot summarise it here. Similarly, we will not discuss the exciting alternative analyses in \nLarson & Yamakido (2008) and Lekakou & Szendr\u0151i (2008), which in part build on a \nprevious version of the account presented here, Mathieu & Sitaridou (2002), who elaborate \non Alexiadou & Wilder (1998), or Ntelitheos (2004), who argues for a much more elaborate \nstructure involving focus. \n9\n There being no such thing as a \u2018Minimalist Theory\u2019: minimalist aspirations are \nmethodologically expressible in any grammatical framework; see Chomsky (2000: 92). \n10\n For a recent take on Scandinavian \u2018double definiteness\u2019 and the related differences \nbetween Swedish and Danish, see the debate in Embick and Noyer (2001), Hankamer and \nMikkelsen (2005) and Embick and Marantz (2008). \n11\n Contrast this to the rather \u2018productive\u2019 nature of Mainland Scandinavian double \ndefiniteness markers \u2013en and \u2013et, as they can appear in the absence of den and det with \ninteresting interpretive effects (albeit different from those of DS): compare Vitte Hus-et \n(\u2018The White House\u2019) with det vitte hus-et (\u2018the white house\u2019, e.g. on the hill). Again, see \nHellan (1986), Delsing (1988) and Taraldsen (1990) for discussion. \n12\n The point in Manolessou (2000: Ch.4) that, diachronically, D-N-D-A predates D-A-D-N \nin Greek by several centuries is probably moot, see also Panagiotidis (2008: 450-452). \n13\n Why this is the case is beyond the scope of this work: the interested reader is referred to \nManolessou\u2019s work for insights. \n  \n59 \n \n                                                                                                                         \n14\n See also example (32) for a correlation between DS and copular structures with elliptical \nDP predicates. \n15\n Although they do not take them to be both DPs. \n16\n The discussion here has greatly benefited from discussions with Kleanthes Grohmann and \ntwo anonymous reviewers, who we wish to thank. \n17\n Note however that the above would not entail that we import a full clausal structure into \nDS, like in Alexiadou & Wilder (1998), as we would still not have a constituent with full \ndiscourse (C) and temporal \/ aspectual (Infl) structure as explained in section 4.3 on illegal \nDS subjects \n18\n A related issue is why *the blue one the house is ungrammatical in English. \n19\n But this is doubtful, see Ihsane (2008). \n20\n We are indebted to Caroline Heycock and Kleanthes Grohmann for discussing this topic \nwith us. \n21\n I.e. the o, i, to paradigm. See footnote 1. \n22\n We treat D-linking and specificity in unison here. No theoretical claims are implied. We \nare grateful to an anonymous reviewer for extensive comments on a previous version of this \npaper. \n23\n The structure exemplified in (26) is run-of-the-mill and is also a common way to express \nkinship terms with proper names in Greek: o thios (o) Nikos (\u2018uncle Nikos\u2019). Interestingly, \nKolliakou (2004: 273-276) discusses related examples of DS with proper names, arguing \nthem to be restrictive (as many people may share the same name). Still, as expected by now, \nin o thios (o) Nikos (\u2018uncle Nikos\u2019) and in the case of DS with proper names such as o Nikos \no psilos (\u2018Nikos the tall one\u2019), the restrictive reading is not necessary. See also section 4.5 \n24\n Naturally, DS with two elliptical DPs is fine, especially as an elliptical answer to a \nquestion like \u201cWhich house would you buy?\u201d: to meghalo to petrino (\u2018the big stone one\u2019). \n  \n60 \n \n                                                                                                                         \nAt this point, it is also worth mentioning what an anonymous reviewer asks: is this DP \nconfiguration possible with two indefinite constituents? In other words, are [meghalo \n[petrino]] and [petrino [meghalo]] possible as DP-sized predication structures? The answer \nis possibly in the affirmative, however the above are virtually indistinguishable, both \nsyntactically and semantically, from monadic elliptical indefinite DPs \u2013 see also section 4.6. \n25\n For instance, see Heim and Kratzer (1998) and Heim (2008) on the interpretive role of \nphi-features. \n26\n In other words, and as Campos & Stavrou (2004) also claim, the D heading the DS \nconstituent (the \u2018predicate\u2019 one) is also the predication operator. It is both referential and \npredicative, reminiscent of Homberg & Nikanne\u2019s (2002) Fin, with its mixed A and A' \nproperties. \n27\n According to Panagiotidis (2002), semantically empty nouns, whether phonologically null \n(eN) or not (one in English), are also present within pronouns \u2013 again argued to be full DPs \n\u2013 and they are the ones triggering pronominal reference. \n"}
