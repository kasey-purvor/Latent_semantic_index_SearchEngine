Introduction: The Need for a Standardized Spectral Measuring System for Deployment at \nEddy Covariance Sites \nUnderstanding the impacts of climate change on ecosystem structure and functions and predicting \necosystem responses to climate change is one of science\u2019s great challenges. In a changing climate, it is \ncritical to understand the dynamics of ecosystem carbon fluxes through monitoring of vegetation \nseasonal changes that depend on the complex flux responses to environmental drivers, mainly linked to \nsoil water, temperature, light and nutrient availability. Present approaches to understanding ecosystem \ncarbon exchange have been made possible through the direct measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) \nand water (H2O) fluxes at eddy covariance (EC) sites and through indirect modelling approaches for \npredicting photosynthetic function. However the restricted spatial representativeness of EC fluxes and \nthe lack of several inputs at required spatial and temporal scales for running the models limit the \necological studies based on these approaches. Remote sensing (RS) offers a unique opportunity to \naddress this issue by providing a method for monitoring ecosystems at synoptic temporal and spatial \nscales through measurements of carbon-related spectral response: from local scale in situ \nmeasurements to the global scale by integrating RS data (e.g., MODIS) into ecological models [1-6]. \nThe use of optical RS instruments directly mounted on EC towers can be considered as an important \nstep towards addressing the scaling issue because it plays a crucial role for spatial extrapolation of in situ \nbiophysical parameters of vegetation (e.g., phytomass, biomass, LAI, chlorophyll and nitrogen content). \nIn this sense it facilitates process-based modelling, validation, and prediction of CO2 and H2O fluxes at \nregional and global scales [7-9] and allows plant photosynthesis to be quantified and monitored \ntemporally [10]. In the last decade several efforts have been initiated by international research groups \nwith the goal of fusing EC data and tower-based optical measurements [11]. Existing hyperspectral \nsystems have been installed at EC sites following different protocols: using a dual beam automatic \nsystem fixed on the tower [12], on mobile platforms [13], adopting rotating hemispherical  \nspectrometers [14] or automated systems for multiangular observations of canopy reflectance [15-17]. \nSpectral properties of vegetation can be also measured by mounting multispectral sensors on flux towers \nand include instruments such as the Cropscan (Cropscan, USA) or CIMEL (Cimel Electronique, FR, \nEurope) radiometers. These systems incorporate discrete distinct wavebands, each sensitive to a specific \nvegetation parameter. Today routine measurements of vegetation indices such as the NDVI (Normalized \nDifference Vegetation Index), PRI (Photochemical Reflectance Index) and WBI (Water Band Index) are \nmade possible using custom built 2- and 4-band radiometers, and currently marketed by Skye Instruments \nin the UK. Work by Huemmrich and colleagues [18] demonstrated that reflectance in the broad bands of \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7957\nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400\u2013700 nm) and near-infrared (NIR; 700\u20133,000 nm) may be \nused to approximate the NDVI with a \u201cbroadband NDVI\u201d. To calculate this broadband NDVI  \nfour-component net radiometers (e.g., CNR-1\/CNR-4, Kipp&Zonen, NL, Europe; LP NET14,  \nDelta-OMH, IT, Europe; NR01\/RA01, Hukseflux, NL, Europe) together with PAR sensors can be \nused. Several groups have adopted this approach and have developed their own sensors centered on \nthese NDVI bands [19,20] while recently Ruy et al. [21] showed the possibility to use light emitting \ndiodes (LEDs) for monitoring vegetation reflectance in narrow spectral bands. \nThe accuracy of these studies is controlled largely by the radiometric and spectral characteristics \ninherent in the sensors themselves. Spectral range of the sensors, channel position, and their resolution \n(Full Width at Half Maximum, or FWHM) usually vary from sensor to sensor, and with the sensor  \nset-up (e.g., height above the canopy, mounting angle, nadir or off-nadir view, field of view-FOV) and \nlocal conditions (e.g., fraction of diffuse to direct radiation). In addition to this, some of the products \nderived from these sensors (e.g., NDVI) are significantly affected by the specific placement and \nspectral bandwidths of the component measurements in red and near infrared regions [22,23].  \nOne of the main scientific challenges is the effective integration of optical sampling at EC sites with \nother measurements, i.e., the scale-appropriateness of the spectral measurements relative to the spatial \nsampling of EC. It is therefore necessary to understand the extent of the optical footprint and how a \nsystem can be configured to best sample the flux footprint. For cross-comparison of different EC sites \nwith different vegetation types and distinct spectral properties it is fundamental to understand the optimal \nsensor set-up which can also be deployed at a variety of sites such that the measurements are both \nreproducible and comparable. In this context currently a strong international effort has been initiated to \naddress these issues within both the flux and spectral communities. Two international groups exist: \n1.  In the EC domain, FLUXNET is a global network of EC sites where the exchanges of carbon \ndioxide, water vapor, and energy between the biosphere and atmosphere are continuously \nmeasured (http:\/\/www.fluxnet.ornl.gov\/fluxnet\/index.cfm) [24].  \n2.  In the spectral domain, both SpecNet (http:\/\/specnet.info) [25] and the European equivalent \nCOST Action ES0903 (EUROSPEC) (http:\/\/cost-es0903.fem-environment.eu\/) initiatives both \nfocus on the identification of the scientific requirements for optical measurement systems \nwhich are reliable, scale-appropriate, cost-effective and validated for deployment on flux \ntowers globally.  \nThere is not yet a common and standardised measurement protocol for the use of optical systems \ntowards the aim of deploying spectral measurement systems at EC sites, although a series of research \ngroups are attempting to investigate the data quality requirements for such studies [26]. As a result, \ninstrument selection for these purposes has been typically performed on an ad-hoc basis by individual \ngroups working at only a few flux tower sites. Therefore spectral measurements protocols vary from \nsite-to-site and often lack traceability to national standards and the use of these data for  \ncross-comparison studies or for scaling-up observations is currently very limited. \nThe overall aim of this paper is to discuss opportunities and limitations of current optical sensors \nand methods used across the European EC network and to provide some recommendations on how \noptical sampling should be carried out. Specific objectives of our study were to determine the type of \ninstruments being used (e.g., hyperspectral, broadband, narrowband) and to determine the mode of \ndeployment (e.g., reflectance quantity measured and sensor\u2019s configuration and calibration status). \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7958\nThis review was based on the responses obtained from the questionnaire designed during the first year \nof activities of COST Action ES0903.  \n2. Method: Design of a Questionnaire on Spectral Measurements at European EC Sites \nFrom July 2010 to February 2011 the management committee of the COST Action ES0903 \ndistributed an online survey to scientists operating EC sites within the European community \n(http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/EUROPSEC-survey). The questionnaire was designed to establish an optimum \nscenario for spectral measurements at flux towers by providing answers to the most relevant scientific \nquestions related to optical sampling. In order to do that and to give recommendations on optical \nsensors to use at the EC towers, it was necessary to know which instruments (hyperspectral, \nmultispectral, broadband, narrowband) and methods of data acquisition (conical, bi-conical; single or \ndual sensor head) are being used, what quantity is measured (e.g., reflectance, radiance, irradiance), and \nhow sensors and data are calibrated (e.g., traceability to international standards). The structure of the \nquestionnaire was organized into four sections. Section 1 contained questions focused on obtaining \ngeneral information on the eddy-covariance sites (name, location, ecosystem type, management activity) \nand information about the research teams working at each site. A suite of questions were included to \ncollect information about the research team\u2019s experience in collecting spectral measurements. The core \nsection of the questionnaire was aimed at gathering information concerning the instruments and \nmeasurements, the sensor(s) and set-ups (including the sampled spectral quantities, how often \ninstruments and data were calibrated, and information on spectral and multi-angular configurations of \nused sensors). The final section referred to the specific applications of the spectral measurements \n(including estimation of biophysical parameters and up scaling activities using satellite data). The \nquestionnaire was pre-tested by members of the COST Action ES0903 to confirm that the respondents \ndid not have difficulties in understanding all of the questions and also to evaluate the possibility of \nincluding new pre-defined answers. This review is based on the responses to the COST questionnaire \nobtained from groups that are working at 40 flux tower sites in Europe (Figure 1 and Table 1) with two \nadditional groups working in Africa and Australia (both of which are non-COST country members).  \nFigure 1.

Results \n3.1. Flux Site Main Characteristics \nQuestionnaire were received responses from researchers working at 40 different eddy covariance \nsites located across the COST countries (Figure 1): one site was located in Austria, one in Denmark, \none in Finland, six in France, twelve in Italy, three in Poland, one in Portugal, five in Spain, four in \nSweden, one in The Netherlands, one in Turkey and two in the United Kingdom. Also two researchers \nof EC sites located in countries outside Europe (Africa and Australia) that signed an agreement with \nthe COST Action filled in the questionnaire. \nThe majority of sites (42.5%, 17 sites) were located in forested areas: seven of which were in \nevergreen needle leaf forests, six in deciduous broadleaf forests, three in evergreen broadleaf forests \nand one in mixed forests. The remaining sites included eight grasslands, five croplands, six wetlands, \ntwo open scrublands, one open savanna, one woody savanna and one savanna. Respondents could \nselect more than one checkbox, so percentages may add up to more than 100%. \nMost of the above EC sites (67.5%, 27 sites) were included in the CarboEurope-IP network from \n2004 to 2008 and continued their activities either through national funding (e.g., CarboItaly project in \nItaly) or through the follow-up IMECC project (http:\/\/imecc.ipsl.jussieu.fr\/). Nine sites reported that \nthey had been monitoring mass and energy fluxes by EC techniques for more than ten years, thirteen \nsites from 5 to 10 years and eighteen sites for less than 5 years. \n3.2. Experience in Spectral Measurements \nOf the forty sites considered, twelve had collected spectral data for more than 5 years, eight sites \nfrom 3 to 5 years, fifteen sites from 1 to 3 years and five sites less than 1 year. Of these, thirty-eight \nsites are still making both optical and flux measurements, and only two sites have stopped their \nmeasurements. \nIn terms of support for spectral data collection, 65% (26 sites) of the research groups reported that \nthey had access to specialist staff to manage and analyze data from optical sensors. At these sites, the \ntechnical and scientific knowledge about spectral measurements was mainly acquired throughout \nundergraduate and\/or postgraduate studies in related subjects, and sometimes through private studies. \nThe majority of groups (60%, 24 sites) declared to have experience in optical sampling at both leaf and \ncanopy level, in PRI and NDVI monitoring and in remote sensing data analysis. Some teams also \nmentioned their experience in fluorescence measurements. For those sites (16 sites) who declared not \nto have a remote sensing specialist in their research group, the investigators learned by themselves to \nuse optical instruments (15 sites) or collaborated with other teams having a background in remote \nsensing (1 site). \nThe majority of the respondents (82.5%, 33) knew about the activities of SpecNet [25], but only  \nthree sites [Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 (Finland), Monte Bondone and Torgnon (Italy)] were directly involved in the \nnetwork. However, when we asked about the potential interest of joining SpecNet, only two sites were \nnot interested in joining the network. Regarding data sharing, just over half (56%) of the respondents \nwere interested in sharing their data under specific agreements, while only 14% of respondents were \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7965\nopen to share their data to without restrictions. The remaining respondents (30%) did not answer  \nthis question. \n \n3.3. Radiance, Irradiance and Reflectance Measurements \n \nA wide range of sensors for optical measurements are now commercially available, and these can \ntypically be classified into three categories: (1) broad-band multispectral sensors; (2) narrow-band \nmultispectral sensors; and (3) hyperspectral sensors. The main distinction between these is their \nspectral bandwidth across the sampled spectrum. The broad-band multispectral sensors capture data in \na few wavelength channels, spanning from tens to hundreds of nanometers across the electromagnetic \nspectrum. Some multispectral instruments can also be built to offer fine spectral resolution data (e.g., \nbandwidth < 10 nm) in a few targeted bands\u2014in this paper we will refer to these as being \u201cfine \nspectral resolution multispectral\u201d instruments. Hyperspectral sensors, on the other hand, measure in \nvery narrow and contiguous (overlapping) channels and can be used to provide more detailed \ninformation in the wavelength domain.  \nThrough the responses collected by the questionnaire, it was possible to draw up a summary table \ndescribing the sensors and set-ups mainly used at the EC sites (Table 1). As reported in Table 1 the \nmajority of EC sites used multispectral sensors (e.g., Kipp&Zonen) or fine spectral resolution \nmultispectral sensors (e.g., Skye, Cropscan, CIMEL) while only five sites reported installation of \nhyperspectral sensors.  \nOptical sensors can be also classified as \u201csingle-beam\u201d (S) or \u201cdual-beam\u201d (D) instruments. An \ninstrument configuration is known as \u201csingle-beam\u201d when the same detector\/instrument is used to \nmeasure the spectral radiance of a target and that incident upon it. When two sensors are employed to \nmeasure the target and the incident irradiance simultaneously the instrument configuration is referred \nto as \u201cdual-beam\u201d. The review by Milton et al. [34] discusses the relative merits of each of these \nconfigurations. Configuration mainly used for two and 4-channel radiometers and fine spectral \nresolution multispectral sensors is dual-beam while for hyperspectral sensors the mode used is  \nuser-dependent and is strictly related to the characteristics of the system (Part 3.4.3). \nFor those researchers working with reflectance factor quantities (24 sites), we posed further questions \nin order to understand which quantities were being measured, according to Schaepman-Strub\u2019s \nnomenclature [35]. Only 42% (10 sites) had read the Schaepman-Strub et al. paper [35] and were \ninformed about the range of distinct \u201creflectance\u201d quantities. The Bi-Hemispherical Reflectance factor \n(BHR) and Hemispherical-Conical Reflectance Factor (HCRF) were most often measured (Table 1). \nAll the respondents considered the use of standardised nomenclature to be important, but many did not \ncomment on whether they correctly applied it. This is an important issue because the correct \napplication of the nomenclature when publishing work is critical to the reproducibility of the results. \nWithout recognition of the central importance of nomenclature in the community, reflectance \nquantities recorded by scientists will continue to be study- or site-specific which will in turn limit their \nbroad application and scientific credibility. The issue of standardisation in terminology is of particular \nimportance to spectral measurements collected in EC settings because the primary aim of such \nmeasurements is to apply them to the scaling of flux measurements. \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7966\n3.4. Spectral Sensors in European EC Sites: Instrument Characteristics and Set-Up \nThe broad range of optical sensors offers a wide assortment of detectors, optics, spectral range and \nspectral sorting filters, allowing customizable bandsets for a range of environmental applications. This \nhas generated a suite of different methodologies for sampling and interpreting optical data. Continuous \nmeasurements are predominantly collected using a nadir view (i.e., 90 degrees to the surface normal) \nat a single fixed point (Table 1 and Figures 2\u20134); there are only nine sites that collect off-nadir \nmeasurements for estimation of bidirectional reflectance quantities. At most sites there is no \nconsistency in the heights that sensors are installed above the canopies, driven largely by the different \ntower infrastructures at each site, and by differences in vegetation structure.  \n \nFigure 2. Some examples of the use of 2- and 4-channel sensors at eddy covariance sites in \nEurope. (a) PRI Skye sensor at Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 forest site (FI-Hyy, Finland), (b) PRI Skye sensor \nat Roccarespampani old forest site (IT-Ro2, Italy), (c) NDVI Skye sensor at Monte \nBondone grassland site (IT-MBon, Italy), (d) Kipp&Zonen sensor at Fontainebleau forest \nsite (FR-Fon, France), (e) Kipp&Zonen sensor at Neustift grassland site (AT-Neu, \nAustria), (f) the sensor for monitoring NDVI developed by Jean-Yves Pontailler at ESE \nLaboratory, CNRS\u2014Univerisit\u00e9 Paris-Sud (France). \n \n \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7967\nFigure 3.

(c) Two Dual Field of View (DFOV) system installed at Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 site, \nFinland (upward pointing cosine receptor in blue; downward fiber in yellow). \n \nSimilarly, sensor field-of-view (FOV) used at EC sites varies considerably from site to site, being \ndependent on the type of sensor and the quantities being measured. For example, some sites use  \nbi-hemispherical instruments with cosine diffusers on both up- and down- looking sensors (e.g., at \nMonte Bondone (Italy) [8]). Kipp&Zonen and HyperSpectral Irradiometer (HIS) sensors are set up \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7968\nwith hemispherical FOVs similarly. In Skye, Multiplexer based Radiometer Irradiometer (MRI), and \nCropscan sensors, the FOV is between 25\u00b0\u201328\u00b0, while Pointailler\u2019s sensor has an FOV of 60\u00b0 [19]. \nThe survey showed that the majority of spectral measurements collected at EC sites are logged \nautomatically through time, usually at time intervals of 30 min or less. Optical sensors are initially \ncalibrated by the suppliers and only periodically recalibrated to correct the data drifting and bias from \ntrue variations by sending the instruments back to the suppliers. \nIn some cases continuous automatic measurements are complemented with specific field \ncampaigns. This is the case for the Biospec project (http:\/\/www.lineas.cchs.csic.es\/biospec) where \nboth optical and biophysical measurements (biomass, water content, nitrogen, chlorophyll) of \nvegetation cover are collected at a FLUXNET site located at Las Majadas del Tietar (C\u00e1ceres, Spain). \nThe area is Mediterranean woody grassland which is grazed by cattle during the vegetation period. The \nvegetation is composed mainly of short grassland and holm oak trees. In this area twelve 25 \u00d7 25 m \nplots randomly distributed within the EC tower footprint (Figure 5) are sampled every 16 days \ncoinciding with the Landsat 5TM overpass. Destructive vegetation sampling of tree leaves and \nherbaceous vegetation is carried out for quantifying vegetation biophysical parameters. Additionally, \nan ASD FieldSpec\u00ae FR3 (www.asdi.com) spectrometer is being used to acquire spectral data in the \nplots. These measurements are taken along two transects with direction NE-SW and NW-SE in  \neach 25 \u00d7 25 m plot at the maximum sun elevation (\u00b12 hours from solar noon). \nFigure 5. Scheme of Biospec protocol for optical and biophysical sampling. \n \n3.4.1. Details on Two and Four Channel Sensors  \n \nTable 1 provides information concerning the most widely used 2- and 4-channel sensors for \nmeasuring NDVI and\/or PRI at the EC sites. Figure 6 shows the percentage of sites where these \nsensors are used to measure NDVI or PRI. Two and 4-channel radiometers mounted on EC towers \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7969\nprovided by Skye or by Kipp&Zonen are dual-beam. Continuous measurements of NDVI were made \nat 35 (87.5%) sites; the majority of those sites (38%, 14 sites) used the CNR-1 or CNR-4 Kipp&Zonen \nto derive a broadband NDVI as proposed by Huemmerich and colleagues [19], 27% (10 sites) the Skye \nSKR 1850, while 19% (7 sites) used the Skye SKR 1800 and the remaining six sites used specially \ndesigned sensors. In some cases (four sites) the CNR-1 Kipp&Zonen and Skye sensors are used \ntogether. It is interesting to note that Skye sensors can be configured to use different filters focused on \ndifferent central wavelengths and bandwidths, while universally maintaining the same optics. In \ncontrast, the characteristics of the Kipp&Zonen sensors are not user selectable, so data are more easily \ncompared between sites. Continuous measurements of PRI using 2- or 4-channel radiometers are \ncollected at 15 sites (37.5%) mainly using Skye instruments (SKR-1800, SKR-1850): 60% (9 sites) of \nthose sites use the 2-channels SKR-1800 sensor and the remaining sites used the 4-channels SKR-1850 \nsensor (Figure 6). Both Skye and Kipp&Zonen sensors are directly calibrated at the factories. Skye \ncalibrates the sensors against a National Physical Laboratory UK reference standard lamp, while \nKipp&Zonen sensors uses the World Radiometric Reference standards. Continuous measurements of \nboth NDVI and PRI are predominantly collected mounting the sensor at the top of the flux tower \nlooking at a single fixed point. Only in the Gungahlin site in Australia, data are collected at various \npoints over a given sampling area using two nodes, each with paired sensors. Data are automatically \nlogged through time every 30, 10 or 1 min. Figure 2 shows some examples of set-ups employed at the \neddy covariance sites in Europe utilizing Skye sensors (a\u2013c) and Kipp&Zonen sensors (d\u2013e). \nFigure 6. Percentage of 2 and 4-channel sensors used for spectral measurements at the \neddy covariance sites. (a) 2 and 4-channel sensors for the measurements of NDVI. (b) 2 \nand 4-channels sensors for the measurements of PRI. \n \nAt Lanjaron, El Saler-Sueca, Vall d\u2019Alinya and Corte de Pallas sites in Spain and at Hesse and \nFontainebleau sites in France, measurements of NDVI are collected by custom NDVI sensor built by \nPontailler and colleagues [19] at ESE Laboratory of CNRS in collaboration with the University of \nParis-Sud. This laboratory-made sensor is a dual beam sensor working in the red (640\u2013665 nm) and \nnear-infrared (750\u2013950 nm) bands. It is equipped with two photodiodes having a large photosensitive \nsurface to ensure a high sensitivity that measure radiances in the red region around 655 nm and in the \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7970\nNIR around 825 nm. For the red channel a gallium arsenide phosphide photodiode is used, while the \nNIR channel uses a silicon photodiode and a longpass glass filter (for more details see [19]). Data are \nautomatically logged each 30 min. The sensor is mounted in a fixed position at the top of eddy \ncovariance flux tower; therefore, the optical sampling is made at single fixed point. The extension of \nthe footprint of the optical measurements varies with the sensor height over the canopy that is site \nspecific. Figure 2(f)) shows the sensor mounted at the Fontainebleau forest site. \n3.4.2. Multispectral Sensors  \nA dual beam Cropscan MSR16R sensor (Cropscan, USA) is used at the Monte Bondone EC site to \nmeasure Hemispherical Conical Reflectance Factors. Upward and downward facing sensors measure \nboth incoming and reflected radiation, nearly simultaneously, which allows for useful reflectance \nreadings in lightly cloudy conditions down to about 300 W\/m2 incident global radiation. The sensor is \nmounted in fixed position at 6 m above the canopy and the FOV of downward looking optic is 28\u00b0. \nData are automatically logged each 10 min from 9.00 AM to 13.00 PM UTC. Cropscan is calibrated by \nresearchers of Monte Bondone each year following the calibration methodology available in the \nmanual device (http:\/\/www.cropscan.com\/2ptupdn.html). Figure 3(a) shows the sensor mounted at the \nMonte Bondone grassland site. \nAt the SMOSREX experimental grassland site (FR-Mau) the Hemispherical-Conical Reflectance \nFactor is determined using two CIMEL single beam radiometers (Cimel Electronique, FR, Europe) [31]. \nReflectance is detected at five wavelengths in the visible and infrared regions: 450 nm (\u00b120 nm),  \n549 (\u00b142.5 nm), 648 nm (\u00b126.5 nm), 837.5 nm (\u00b145.5 nm), 1,640.2 nm (\u00b182.3 nm). Both sensors are \npositioned at 15 m above the canopy viewing a fixed area. The downward sensor is looking southward \nand the upward sensor has an angle of 0\u00b0 from horizon, while the downward sensor is placed with \nangle of 40\u00b0. A cos-conical calibration method, which calibrates according to an upward-pointing \nirradiance sensor, was applied in 2003 to calibrate the radiometer. Reflectance readings are \nautomatically collected at a single fixed point and logged every 60 min. Figure 3(b,c) show the set-up \nof the two CIMEL sensors mounted at SMOREX site. \n \n3.4.3. Hyperspectral Sensors \nFew sites are equipped with automatic spectral systems for the collection of unattended, continuous, \nlong time series of hyperspectral measurements at the moment. The hyperspectral systems currently \ninstalled at European EC sites are: the Multiplexer based Radiometer Irradiometer (MRI) [10] and the \nHyperSpectral Irradiometer (HIS) [32] developed at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy). Both of \nthese systems utilize Ocean Optics spectroradiometers. In addition other two Ocean Optics \nspectrometer systems are used in Europe. One system developed by Nichol and colleagues in the \nSchool of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh is deployed at Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4 (Finland), and the other \n(TriFLEX) developed by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Ecole Polytechnique of \nPalaiseau Cedex is deployed at Avignon (France) site [33]. \nThe MRI is based on a commercially available optical multiplexer (MPM-2000, OceanOptics, \nUSA) which is able to switch between a channel measuring incident irradiance (cosine response \nforeoptic), a down-looking bare fiber (field of view of 25\u00b0) for the measurement of upwelling radiance \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7971\nand a \u201cblind\u201d channel for the spectrometer dark current measurement. MRI thus allows the \nmeasurement of the HCRF. Optical components (multiplexer, spectrometers), personal computer and \npower supply are housed in a thermally controlled protective box to ensure that the radiometric \nresponse is stablised through time, and to reduce measurement uncertainty associated with changes in \nambient conditions [36]. The HSI system uses a rotating cosine-response optic to measure the \nirradiance incident on and upwelling from the investigated surface, allowing the computation of the  \nbi-hemispherical reflectance (BHR). The spectrometer dark current is measured at each acquisition \nsession using a mechanical shutter. Among other devices available on the market, OceanOptics \n(Dunedin, FL, USA) spectrometers were chosen because they are small, highly configurable in terms \nof spectral range and resolution and relatively inexpensive. Spectrometers embedded in both HSI and \nMRI are spectrally calibrated with a known standard (CAL-2000 mercury argon lamp, OceanOptics) \nand radiometrically cross-calibrated to a FieldSpec FS FR spectrometer (ASD, USA) which in turn is \ncalibrated by the manufacturer with a yearly frequency. Furthermore, the stability of the spectral \ncalibration is regularly assessed using field measured irradiance data and the SpecCal algorithm [12]. \nBoth systems are operated automatically by a personal computer through the 3S software [37]. An HSI \nsystem is currently installed on a flux tower in Torgon (IT-Tor, Italy) and a MRI on a flux tower near \nPisa (IT-Pisa, Italy). Figure 4 gives an example of the use of MRI (Figure 4(a)) and HSI (Figure 4(b)). \nThe method used by this group is among the most rigorous of all those surveyed, and is a worthy \nbenchmark for reproducible measurements for others to follow. \nNichol and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh have similarly designed, built and are running \ntwo Dual Field of View (DFOV) systems. The rationale for the deployment of these new optical \nsystems is to utilize remotely developed methods to detect changes in photosynthesis at the canopy \nscale through the integration of tower, aircraft and satellite-based remotely sensed data. In doing so the \nproject is actively describing the temporal and spatial dynamics of photosynthetic light use efficiency \n(\u03b5) and chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) in contrasting vegetation types in a north-to-south climate \ngradient. Upward and downward-pointing rugged spectrometers (Ocean Optics USB2000+,  \nFMHM 1.0 nm, spectral range 400\u20131,000 nm,) housed in thermally controlled boxes, (maintaining \ninternal temperature at 35 \u00b0C + 0.5 \u00b0C) are currently installed on two flux towers (Hyyti\u00e4l\u00e4, Finland \nand Griffin, UK) and are acquiring spectral data continuously at between 5\u201315 min intervals  \n(Figure 4(c)). An upward pointing cosine fiber optic measures irradiance and a downward pointing 600 \nmicron fiber measures upwelling radiance. The spectral data are acquired simultaneously and are inter-\ncalibrated. In house (stable) software has been developed (in Java) and controls the operation of each \npair of spectrometers. \nTriFLEX uses two identical spectrometers (HR2000+, Ocean Optics) to simultaneously measure \nirradiance and vegetation radiance spectra [33]. These spectrometers cover the spectral range  \nof 630\u2013815 nm with a resolution of 0.5 nm [full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)] and an encoding \nresolution of 0.09 nm\/pixel. The main advantage of simultaneous measurement of the reference and \nthe sample is an improved time resolution by a factor of two to three, which allows for fast \nfluorescence changes induced by clouds and sun spells to be monitored. A third spectrometer \n(HR2000+, Ocean Optics) measures vegetation radiance on the spectral range 300\u2013900 nm (50 \u03bcm \nentrance slit, FWHM-2 nm). Every 20 min, the reference board is switched from the default position to \nthe calibration position by the means of a rotary solenoid (GDAX035X20E06, Magnet-Schultz). In the \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7972\ncalibration position, the reference intercepts the FOV of all spectrometers. At the end of the day, a \nlinear relationship is deduced from the measurements of vegetation and reference. \n3.5. Applications \nThe development of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors for continuous measurements of \ncanopy optical properties opened new insight on vegetation indices applications in ecological \nmodeling, biophysical parameters assessing (LAI, biomass, nitrogen and water content) and carbon \nfluxes estimating. Several authors proposed the use of multispectral optical sensors to derive some \nbroadband and fine multispectral vegetation indices, as NDVI and SR [18,38-40]. Also Wohlfahrt and  \ncolleagues [9] that filled the questionnaire used this approach based on broad-band NDVI sensors to \nestimate carbon dioxide fluxes of temperate mountain grasslands in Austria. Tower-derived NDVI \nvalues are closed to in situ NDVI [23,38] but the variability of tower-NDVI is not as high as in the \nradiometer in situ NDVI. Wilson and Meyers [39] and Tittedrant et al. [23] reported that tower-NDVI \nshows close values to MODIS satellite data for grassland and crops but large scatter for forests. The \nadvantage of the broadband NDVI is their temporal resolution that can be hourly or higher and the \nabsence of the atmospheric disturbances. They are also low cost sensor and easy to use responding \nthus to limited funding available in most of cases for EC groups. Abergel and collaborators used \ncontinuous reflectance measurements of fine multispectral resolution of CIMEL sensors for predicting \nLAI and validate SURFLEX model outputs [31]. \nRegarding the use of hyperspectral sensors at EC sites, there are still few scientific teams that are \nworking on this issue. These groups focused their attention mainly on studying florescence, estimating \nPRI and modeling ecosystem gross production. Beyond our specific survey results, it is important to \nhighlight the relevant works of Hilker et al. [16,17] and Gamon et al. [13] who have developed novel \nmethods for year-round unattended hyperspectral measurements at flux sites with excellent results. \nThe power of these approaches is the application of methods for estimating spatially coherent \nvegetation properties which hold meaning for the EC footprint, rather than just for a single fixed point \nbelow the tower. In Europe, Rossini and colleagues [10] are leading the way in developing \nhyperspectral systems with good reproducibility. The reason for the small number of people using \nhyperspectral systems in unattended settings is that hyperspectral spectroradiometers are not \nnecessarily designed with this in mind, and therefore adapting them to be weather proof, motorized and \nwith data storage connections is not trivial. Technological advances in recent times by those mentioned \nabove will pave the way for a larger scientific deployment of these instruments across other sites, because \nthe results obtained are already showing good relationships with EC fluxes [9,10,20,33,40]. \n4. Current Controversial Issues \nFrom the responses to the online survey it is possible to answer to which optical sensors are used by \nthe EC community and how these data are collected but there are still some open questions linked \nmainly to spatial and temporal resolution, scale-appropriateness of measurements, long-term data and \nsensor calibration, and data repeatability and reproducibility that require further discussion.  \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7973\n4.1. Radiometric and Spectral Resolution \nIn general, dual beam configuration, where reflectance measurements are made nearly \ninstantaneously, is known to produce more precise data than single beam systems, because of the \nreduced time delay between reference measurements of the incident irradiance, and measurements of \nupwelling radiance from the target. The caveat is that for this to work, both dual-beam instruments \nmust be spectrally and radiometrically matched and inter-calibrated [41] which carries an additional \nprocessing and cost burden.  \nHyperspectral and fine spectral resolution multispectral sensors allow for the quantitative analysis \nof spectral features of the canopy biophysical variables (e.g., biomass, water, nitrogen and chlorophyll \ncontent, and photosynthesis pigment activity) to be carried out [42-44]. The main limitation is that \nthese sensors are usually configured for just one specific index and therefore flexibility to calculate \nother indices is limited.  \nThe great advantage of using hyperspectral sensors rather than multispectral sensors is thus the \npossibility to use the full spectral information and to compute any desired vegetation index rather than \na pre-defined one dictated by the sensor spectral set-up. Moreover the selection of new narrow \nwavebands in hyperspectral data has demonstrated an increase in the sensitivity of the vegetation \nindices to different vegetation biophysical variables [45]. Hyperspectral instruments are installed in a \nlimited EC towers for continuous\/unattended measurements [10,17,25,32] due to the high start-up \ncosts and the additional complexity of making them weatherproof and automated.  \n4.2. Spatial Resolution (Footprint) \nThe spatial dimension of spectral measurements at EC sites (e.g., the connection between the sensor \nsupport and the EC footprint) continues to be an area of great debate. This issue is related to the spatial \nrepresentativeness of spectral data acquired in complex ecosystems where plant architecture, density \nand homogeneity play an important role in both the spectral response of the canopy, and in the gaseous \nfluxes measured at EC towers. With regards to this, the main scientific challenge is to identify the most \nsuitable spatial support for optical sampling in flux settings and to define how this can be considered to \nbe statistically representative of vegetation types and their physiological\/ phenological status. This \nissue is strictly linked to the extension of both fluxes and radiation measurements and also to the EC \nfootprint [46,47]. It is well known that flux footprints vary in relation to atmospheric stability, wind \nspeed, measurement height, canopy structure and the vertical distribution of sources and sinks. For \nexample, the dimension of the source area of turbulent fluxes can vary between 10 to 100 times of the \nmeasurements height during the same day as a result of changes in micro-meteorological  \nconditions [46]. On the contrary, the relationship between the footprint of radiation sensors and the \nflux footprint has not fully been considered and is necessary to take it into account when using datasets \nfrom both EC sensors and spectral measurement systems in tandem. For this reason, the footprint of \nthe radiation sensors must be fully characterized prior to use through reference to the physical \ncapabilities of the instrument (e.g., FOV and optics), in combination with an understanding of how and \nwhere the sensor is mounted on the flux tower (height of measurements, orientation). Orienting the \nsensor obliquely will increase the footprint area of the radiation measurements, and will also increase \nthe proportion of projected canopy to ground. All directional measurements are affected by reflectance \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7974\nanisotropy, which needs to be considered when orienting the sensor. From the responses to the \nquestionnaire, it is clear that optical samplings at the flux tower are usually collected at a single fixed \ndirection. In the literature there are some studies where optical measurements are made considering the \neddy fluxes footprint. For example in Hilker et al. [16,17] optical spectral measurements were \ncollected over a circular area centered at the flux tower using a rotating system while Gamon and \ncolleagues [13] used a tram system to make spatially representative measurements within the EC tower \nfootprint. These are really unique systems that fully consider the relationship between the \nmeasurement support of the spectral instrument and the EC footprint.  \n \n4.3. Distribution of Light throughout the Canopy (BRDF Problem) \nAnother fundamental aspect to be considered in optical sampling is the distribution of light \nthroughout the canopy (i.e., the classic surface BRDF problem). Reflection, absorption and \ntransmission of sunlight depend on canopy structure, foliar distribution and solar zenith angle. Only \nthe system proposed by Hilker and colleagues, AMSPEC-II system, is integrated with a LiDAR device \nthat permits also the measure of the light transmitted into the canopy [17]. AMSPEC is designed to \nautomatically acquire spectra with different viewing angles allowing the analysis and interpretation of \nthe optical signals in terms of BRDF. However complementary measurements made by LiDAR [17] \nshould help to better understand the role of plant architecture, density and homogeneity in the \nvegetation spectral responses. There is still considerable work to do on this subject and our \nunderstanding of how best to tackle this problem at EC sites requires further work. \n4.4. Calibration \nThe calibration of automated optical sensors used to monitor flux sites on a continuous basis is a \nnew challenge within the remote sensing community. Our survey showed that some of the spectral \ninstruments used at EC sites were rarely calibrated against standard laboratory sources. This is \nprobably because in \u201creflectance\u201d scenarios, the absolute radiometric calibration of the instrument is \nnot critical due to the ratioed nature of the reflectance factor calculation. While we would agree that \nabsolute radiometric calibration of sensors (e.g., to radiance or irradiance) is less important if \nreflectance quantities are being measured, three key elements of the measurement are critical: 1. the \nabsolute reflectance of the calibration standard (e.g., Spectralon panel) in bi-conical measurement \nsituations; 2. the cosine response of any irradiance sensor used in cos-conical methods; and 3. regular \nwavelength calibrations of all sensors used. The first two are central to the magnitude of the \ndetermined reflectance quantity being correctly defined, and the latter is needed to ensure that any \nspectral indices determined are using the correct wavelength regions. All users of such equipment \ncould perform simple in-field or dark-room checks to enable early detection of sensor or panel \ncalibration drift but our survey did not give clear results to show whether this was being frequently \nundertaken by users. Failure to ensure regular calibration of these instruments will result in  \nnon-reproducible results which will be of limited scientific value. \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7975\n4.5. Temporal Resolution \nTemporal and spatial sampling issues remain the key aspects in the framework of optical and flux \ndata matching in traditional vegetation studies. Standard field spectroscopy generally consists of \nperiodically taking series of point measurements of vegetation (leaf and\/or canopy) at times of the day \nwhen the solar angle does not cause excessive shadowing (i.e., \u00b12 hours of solar noon) throughout the \nvegetation period. In this framework, continuous ground measurements are crucial to overcoming the \nmismatch problems with the temporal scale of the satellite data collection [18].  \n \n4.6. Repeatability, Reproducibility and Cross-Comparison of Measurements  \nA further challenge for researchers involved in optical sampling is how to make repeatable and \nreproducible spectral measurements. In order to compare field spectral measurements between \ndifferent instruments, or across different field sites, it is first necessary to understand the physical \ncapabilities of the sensors. For example, repeatability measures such as the noise equivalent delta \nradiance (NE\u0394L; measured in laboratory conditions, usually against an integrating sphere source) can \ninform about the baseline sensitivity of the radiometer\u2019s detector(s) across the spectral range. Such \ndata convey information on the radiant sensitivity of the detector, and thus on the most reliable region \nof the spectrum to sample [48,49]. Regular wavelength checks on instruments as well as wavelength \ncalibration are also important, particularly for vegetation applications. This is because algorithms such \nas PRI require the delineation of narrow spectral features, which relies on precise definition of the \nwavelength position. Offsets or shifts in the instrument\u2019s wavelength sensitivity could yield misleading \nresults in such applications. It is important to bear in mind that the above two measures yield only a \nlaboratory-derived quantification of instrument precision and in isolation they are unlikely to describe \nall the uncertainty associated with field spectral measurements. It should also be observed that  \nfield-sensors are commonly affected by dark-current drift which is a temperature-dependent shift in \nvalues that may vary across the season, particularly at sites with large temperature variations [32]. This \nshift can be corrected using night-time values in continuous monitoring systems [29] or using \nautomatic dark current shutters in sensors such as ASD FieldSpec Pro. For cross-comparison across \nsites, or between different instruments, a more detailed assessment and documentation of data quality \nis required. Here we explicitly refer to the \u201creproducibility\u201d of the measurements, which is dependent \nupon the spectroradiometer\u2019s inherent NE\u0394L and wavelength sensitivity, coupled with the \nmethodology used to acquire the data under field conditions. This will, of course, vary from instrument \nto instrument, and according to the specific conditions prevailing at the time of the measurement (e.g., \nthe solar zenith angle, sky conditions, time of day etc, and including the instrument set-up and the \ntarget being measured). There is now a drive for all users of spectroradiometric equipment to both \nmeasure and document reproducibility estimates for published measurements [48] so that such data \nhave long-term value beyond the scope of the individual studies.  \n5. Conclusion and Issues for the Future \nThis review has shown that in the EC community there is no consensus about a single methodology \nto collect optical measurements at EC sites. At the moment, groups of researchers undertaking these \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7976\nmeasurements are typically operating individually, following their own methodologies for such \nmeasurements. This has resulted in a range of different instruments and approaches for spectral \nmeasurements at EC sites. The choice of the sensor and their use is principally linked to available \nbudget that in most cases is limited because of principal investigators must self-fund the acquisition, \nset up and processing of spectral data satisfying individual funding applications. This creates \nchallenges for comparisons between sites, and limits the possibility of developing a common protocol \nfor use at all EC sites. However, a helpful initiative on the integration and standardization of optical \nsampling into European EC network it represented by IMECC-\u201cInfrastructure for Measurements of \nthe European Carbon Cycle\u201d (more details at http:\/\/imecc.ipsl.jussieu.fr). The innovative aspect of \nIMECC with respect to previous projects was to propose the use of same sensor and following the \nsame methodology to measure spectral response in the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) [50] \nbands. So far IMECC has supported the development of ICOS-\u201cIntegrated Carbon Observation \nSystem\u201d initiative (more details at http:\/\/www.icos-infrastructure.eu\/) that aims to establish an \nintegrated long-term research infrastructure for understanding the biogeochemical cycles of \ngreenhouse gases in Europe. Currently ICOS is in the preparatory phase (2009\u20132012) during which the \nset-ups of the sensors and protocols of measurements at the eddy covariance sites are defined. Analysis \nof optical samplings needs and limits discussed in this review can act as a first line guide on optical \nsapling at EC helping researchers to choose the most suitable sensor and set-up to use in their sites \n(e.g., in the ICOS framework). From this review two possible standards (basic standard and advanced \nstandard) could be considered in relation to IMECC and ICOS requirements, with regards to \nrecommending the best approach for optical measurements at EC sites. \n5.1. The Basic Standard \nIn the basic standard set-up the main consideration is the cost-effectiveness of the instrument in \ndelivering routine high-quality radiometric data for year-round unattended measurements. This \nstandard could be adopted at a large number of sites in order to provide high quality reflectance factor \ndata on reflectance quantities needed for cross-comparison. Our survey showed a wide use of \n(comparatively) low-cost (e.g., Skye) and radiometrically sensitive multispectral sensors for \ncontinuous measurements at EC sites. These sensors have proven capabilities in measuring NDVI and \nPRI. Scientific evidence points to these being fit for purpose and able to withstand the rigours of \ncontinuous exposure to weather. The main issue of the review is that users do not consistently check \ntheir calibration, and this would be required for maintaining high data quality across sites. Additionally \nICOS and IMECC would require that these sensors be settled-up according to uniform measurement \ngeometry and that measurement acquisition be standardized with respect to timing, calibration and  \ndata processing. \nThere are several options then to consider: Skye fine resolution multispectral radiometers or \nbroadband radiometers (Hukseflux, Delta-HOM, Kipp&Zonen). Each has its relative merits, Skye \nsensors are more flexible in their ability to be configured towards collection of data for specific \nspectral indices (e.g., NDVI, PRI). Moreover, using a 4-channel Skye instrument it is possible to \nconcurrently measure two vegetation indices. The upwards-pointing cosine diffuser however, would \nneed to be regularly tested to ensure a good cosine response. The other radiometers (i.e., Hukseflux, \nSensors 2011, 11                            \n \n7977\nDelta-HOM, Kipp&Zonen) are easy to deploy but require an additional sensor to provide reflected \nglobal radiation so that NDVI can be calculated.  \n \n5.2. The Advanced Standard \nThe advanced standard could be proposed for a limited number of sites where high standard of all \nflux and meteorological variables are required. In this case we recommend to add to standard \ninstruments package an instruments for hyperspectral measurements that could be the UniSpec-DC (PP \nSystems, USA) or USB2000 (Ocean Optics) hyperspectral radiometers. However with a large budget \nsupply it should be reasonable to use AMSPEC II systems [17] because it is the most proven existing \ntechnology for optical sampling at the EC sites. AMSPEC II can collect optical data with a very high \nspatial, temporal, and spectral resolution under different view and sun angles and allows a complete \nanalysis of the relationships between spectral reflectance and carbon flux dynamics. \n5.3. General Guidelines for Routine Optical Sampling at EC Sites \nOptical sampling at the EC sites should be made following the recommendations reported here. For \nroutine optical measurements it is enough to use multispectral sensors indicated in the basic standard \nprocedure. We recommend using dual beam fine resolution (e.g., Skye) or multispectral sensors  \n(i.e., Hukseflux, Delta-HOM, Kipp&Zonen). The field of view of downward sensors could vary \nbetween 20 and 25 degrees for fine resolution multispectral sensors or nearly to 180 degrees for \nmultispectral sensors. In both cases the optic of the up-looking sensor could be a cosine receptor. To \nincrease footprint of optical measurements and proportion of projected canopy to ground nadir \nposition, we recommend orienting the sensor obliquely and defining sensor\u2019s height over the canopy \nconsidering FOV of the sensors (footprint) together with structure and spatial distribution of the \nvegetation. Using fine resolution multispectral sensors, spectral bandwidths for NDVI should be lower \nthan 50 nm [22] centered roughly at 680 nm and 760 nm while for PRI bandwidths for NDVI should \nbe lower than 10 nm centered at 529 nm and 568 nm. We recommend cleaning and checking always \nthe right position of the sensors. Calibration of the sensors should be necessary at least ones per year at \nthe beginning of the growing season by sending back sensor to the suppliers. The optical data should \nbe collected at least each 30 min agreeing with time resolution of fluxes and meteorological variables \neven if a higher time resolution is more suitable in understanding photosynthetic processes and light \nresponse [50]. All optical data should be stored with other energy fluxes variables as incoming and \noutgoing radiation and diffuse radiation that can help to understand environmental condition during \nspectral acquisition. Finally all changing in set-up or in data acquisition should be reported in order to \ncheck the quality of data. \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was supported by the EU COST Office in the framework of the Action ES0903. \nC.Nichol\u2019s project on spectral sensing is funded through a UK Natural Environment Research Council \nstandard grant (NE\/F017294\/1).
