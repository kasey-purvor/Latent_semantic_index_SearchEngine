The core of this paper is a science fiction short story. We are on \nplanet DOR. A group of scientists are working on an experiment, changing \nunderlying mechanisms of transmissions of a colossus machine \u2013 a complex \nsystem of gears and levers, wires and pipes. Some of its mechanisms are also \nknown as D for Doctors, F for Pharmacists, P for Patients. Observers travel \nfrom Earth to study the experiment. Their dilemmas are unaided by their \nadvanced research tools. The story is inspired by research carried out for the \nevaluation of the forthcoming Electronic Prescription Service in England (UK). \nOur fiction is fiction, but it is also a methodological means, a reflexive lever to \nelaborate and explore our research texts and to question the feasibility, meaning \nand impact of researching future technology.  \nKeywords: future, technology, fiction, systems for electronic transmission of \nprescriptions, reflexivity, research methods. \n \n1   Preface \nStanislaw Lem \u2013 Solaris: \u201cI had missed the precious moment when the planet first \ncame into view. Now it was spread out before my eyes; flat, and already immense\u201d \n[1].  \n \nThe core of this paper is a science fiction story. This preface provides the rationale for \nwriting the story, which is then followed by reflections. Some readers may wish to \nbegin by reading the story first (section 2), then read this preface.   \n \nAs researchers adopting a social constructionist perspectives [2] we seek to produce \ncoherent accounts of our research context through interpretation. We are involved in a \nUK project to evaluate the introduction of an Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) in \nprimary care and thus EPS is our research context. At the time of writing, our research \nproject is evaluating EPS at the same time as EPS is being developed. EPS compliant \nsoftware applications are being piloted by a few prescriber (e.g local doctors surgery) \nand dispenser (e.g local pharmacy) sites in England (UK). The challenges of \nevaluating a national IT project in development are perhaps self-evident: the lack of a \ndefinite set of IT systems in place and in use, changing requirements and \nspecifications, and more generally, a shifting ground. The very existence of EPS has \nbeen under scrutiny. This is made more complex by major changes in the UK \nNational Health Service (NHS) brought about by a newly elected government. \nEvaluating EPS in the present is thus researching its future, in all its uncertainties, and \nwith very limited space for contributing to steering its course.  \n \nOur evaluation project is undertaking detailed observations of, and interviews with, \nGeneral Practitioners, Pharmacists, technologists and various other stakeholders. Such \nobservations and interviews are recorded, transcribed and entered into our evidence \nbase as \u201cresearch texts\u201d. Our epistemology is that of interpretivism \u2013 we seek not an \nobjective truth but interpretations of the world of EPS. Yet as researchers we seem to \nface the gravitational pull of an enlightenment straightjacket, taught since our birth \nand embedded within our research culture \u2013 in our observations we naturally seek \n\u201cobjective data\u201d, \u201cevidence\u201d, \u201ctheory\u201d and \u201cconclusions\u201d in order to produce research \npapers. Such papers rely heavily on \u201cresearch texts\u201d* produced from literature, project \ndocuments, transcripts, conversations etc.  Our papers are open to scrutiny and must \nbe produced in this way \u2013 speculation and conjecture can have no place in an \nevaluation of such a politically charged context. \n \nBut what if we were to say that this is important but not sufficient? That as \nresearchers we are always ethnographic \u2013 physically embedded within a research \ncontext we do not (and cannot) fully grasp? We constantly seek our own \ninterpretations of this context in order to move forward towards a future of modest \nunderstanding. We visit EPS sites, attend meetings, talk with people, read, reflect and \ndiscuss and in this we assimilate personal understanding which we struggle to record \nor express. Further our interpretations of the EPS implementation includes non-verbal \nclues, tacit perceptions, feelings, moods, incoherent contradictory ideas and \nconspiracy theories \u2026 all emerging from our experience of the field, but \u201cinvalid\u201d for \ntraditional research purposes.  \n \nSeeking to find a way to express this kind of \u2018unscientific\u2019 understanding of EPS, \nwe welcome the invitation to write a non-traditional paper\u2020. We are thus challenging \nourselves by seeking to use fiction and storytelling to reflexively elaborate our tacit \nknowledge so as to better understand the EPS research context in which we are \nundertaking research, and through this to improve our traditional research practices.  \n \nFiction and storytelling has an important role in knowledge sharing and reflexive \nanalysis [3], [4], [5] providing a fluid structure in which knowledge can be expressed \nand \u201cinfusing events with meaning\u2026 through the magic of plot\u201d [4]. This allows \nconcepts to be remembered, altered, shared and allows meaning to diffuse. Similarly \nthe use of metaphor can help in sharing tacit knowledge [6]. Engagement with stories \n                                                          \n*\n By texts we refer to the broad set of evidential material produced in research \u2013 transcripts, \nvideos, audio-recordings, written observations etc. \n\u2020\n This paper was written in response to a call for papers for IFP WG 8.2 2011 conference \n\u2018Researching the Future\u2019 (https:\/\/www.wg82.abo.fi\/callforpapers.php). The call invited \u2018non-\ntraditional approaches and formats\u2019, such as science-fiction.  \nand the \u2018emotional mind\u2019 has been promoted to teach software quality [7] and used \neffectively to communicate information systems leadership ideas [8]. Most vitally \nwriting allows for a self-reflexive analysis of our understanding \u2013 turning the lens \ninwards on the researcher. \n \n \nWhile we could further discuss fiction as research method, we wish to leave the \ncentre-stage to the fiction itself. We leave to the reader the interpretations of its \nmeanings, in terms of technology for the electronic transmission of medical \nprescriptions, and more generally, in relation to more-or-less-utopian IT projects, in \nhealthcare and other sectors, and the role researchers play in their implementation. In \nconcluding this \u2018paper\u2019 we include some of the comments and reflections to our \nfiction and provide a set of questions as a starting point to the wider debate on \nResearching the Future.  \nThe reader remains free to like or dislike the fiction, agree or disagree with the \nquestions, though we hope this exercise will inspire others to consider writing fiction \nas part of their methodological arsenal, as a reflective \u201cmode of thought to question \n(and imagine) change\u201d [9]. We should be humble of our inevitable limitations as \nresearchers \u2013 and \u201csuch humility is essential in creating an environment in which we \ncan learn about the complex systems in which we are embedded and work effectively \nto create the world we truly desire\u201d [10]. \n \n2   Journey to DOR\u2021 \nThe colossal machine was built on a tall thin grid that enabled scientists and observers \nto work on both sides. Dials, buttons, knobs and levers were connected by a partially \nvisible intricacy of pipes and wires \u2013 a giant radio-like structure without its case. A \nconstant luminous flow was running through the pipes, cylinders and drums moving \nregularly up and down, while interconnected gears turned one another at various \nspeeds similar to the hours, minutes and seconds arms of a clock. A scaffold was \nerected around the machine, so that only the very upper part was accessible. This \nscaffold gave a bottomless view of the machine below, and its hazy boundaries on the \neastern and western sides. It left a vague awareness that other scaffolds might exist at \nthe edges.   \nA readoscope device connected amongst the pipes produced constant monitoring of \ninputs and outputs, rates of flows and volumes of stock \u2013 state of health, volume of \nmedicines, monetary value. Tiny fluorescent labels identified some of the main \ncontrols: D for doctors, F for pharmacists, M for the manufacturers of medicines, L \nfor money, P for the patients and those caring for them \u2026 \n                                                          \n\u2021\n  This text is loosely based on Stanislaw Lem\u2019s book Solaris (2003, first published in 1961, \ntranslated in English in 1970). Words taken literally from Solaris are highlighted in italics \n(with page numbers referenced in superscript); Lem\u2019s words have been taken out of their \noriginal context and placed in this new, completely different story. \nSince the start of the new equinox scientists had been working on an experiment to \nintroduce a new layer into the apparatus, a new messaging system E based not on \npipes of liquid but on electrical impulses. The aim of this transition was to improve \nthe quality of the readoscope results, and the flow and gearings. They had invited the \nobservers to study the experiment and report back to the home planet on its outcome. \nThe observers were expected to land any time soon, their expedition had been delayed \nby an interstellar ethical storm. E was already in place, all wired-up, and the scientists \nwere anxious to begin.   \n \n*** \n \nFrom the portholes of the spaceship they could see the stars, but this portion of the \nsky was unfamiliar to2 them. Some of them had heard of it, but none of them had \nvisited DOR before. As they got closer to the station, they realized they were landing \non a shifting ground, moving at variable speed. They left their cabin at a point of \ntemporary still, but as soon as their feet touched ground they had to take a step \nforward in order to keep their balance5. The expected welcoming party had been \ncancelled, and the observers were ushered through empty corridors and piles of \npapers, directly to the machine room. Were the scientists happy to see them? \n \nThe observers took a position behind the grid, this provided them with a parallel \nview of all the mechanisms. The scientists were on the other side, with access to the \ncontrols. The machine was running its flows and glows, more or less smoothly. A roll \nof printed paper was spinning out of the readoscope, though little was made of it by \nthose in the room \u2013 it simply fell through an opening in the scaffolding. Introductions \nwere made, and the observers were given information materials on the experiment. It \nwas explained to them that E had already been put in place, to save time, and that the \ncountdown was ready to start. Did they have any questions?  \n \nThe observers tried to pay attention but their eyes were distracted by the rhythmic \nmove of this glowing apparatus with a life of its own, while their bodies were \nstruggling to stay still on the shifting foot-base. They tried to decipher the \nmechanisms and their movements \u2013 make a map of them in their mind \u2013 but they \nstruggled to understand the roles and relationships in the little time. They decided to \nfocus on E. Ask for further details on its inner working and expected benefits.  \n \nA transparent thin glass was layered in front of the machine and a projection of E \nwas superimposed on its mechanisms. The scientists had used this method before \nquite successfully to illustrate their vision. The starting point was the Doctors. E was \nexpected to reduce the load on D; the corresponding gear would run more easily and \ntransmit the effect on F; a temporary increased load on F would be transformed by its \ninner circuits in tighter controls on P, which at the same time would reduce volumes \nin M and pressure on L. The result was expected to be a smoother, more efficient, \nproductive, effective, safer apparatus. The non-linear equations in the underlying \nmathematical model had shown that E would also save energy and generally improve \nthe health status of the planet. Minor glitches were expected in the transmission \nmechanisms, due to inertia-resistance forces, but the scientists were confident that \nthey could be greased and recast as and when necessary.  \n \nAs the thin glass projection screen retracted, the countdown began \u2013 two-hundred \nand fifty, two-hundred and forty-nine, two-hundred and forty-eight3 \u2026 \n \nKeep a hold on thyself. Be open to see anything. That was the only advice they had \nbeen given before boarding. The observers could not think of anything better11. \nDuring the presentation the scaffold had temporarily paused its shifting, making \nground for sound mathematical certitude20. But the rolling had slowly started again as \nsoon as the countdown button had been pushed. And the strong starlight coming \nthrough the portholes cast double shadows27 that were hindering the observations. The \ncloser they tried to position themselves to the machine, the more defined were the \ndouble contours of their own shadows.  \n \n\u2026 five, four, three, two point nine, two point eight, two point seven nine, two point \nseven eight ...  roll-out. The start button pushed to its full length, the E gear began to \nslowly turn, steering D to a skewed angle. The transmissions led to a shaking of the \nwhole machine, gear by gear, pipe by pipe, with jolts and scratches. The scientists \nwere reading the readoscope prints, while tightening bolts, loosening belts, oiling pins \n- mechanics tuning the engine. Speed began to increase, the shuffling of M more \nrapid.  The scientists kept an eye on the observers, as if to read their minds and share \nenthusiasm for the new venture. The observers glanced back through the grid, almost \nhypnotized by the rhythmic movement of the machine but unsure what to read in the \nscientists faces. The load on D initially increased - as expected - but it was now \nslowly diminishing; F was taking on the work and modifying its internal circuits to \ncope with the pressure \u2013 a groaning could be heard from that part of the machine; \nthough P was running as usual \u2013 something only the scientists initially noticed. The \ngear did not seem to modify its behaviour the way it should have. The scientists \nhoped the lack of change in P would be un-noticeable to the observers. Absence is \nmore difficult to notice than presence, usually, isn\u2019t it? That would give them time to \nfix the malfunctioning without the need to account for it. They turned to the \nreadoscope. They knew the high volume of data it was producing was of great value. \n \n*** \n \nThe observers had prepared for this machine by reading books and papers, but the \nreality was far more complicated. It was made of more gears and control devices than \nthose explained in the presentation \u2013 G.overnment, M.edia, M.ass and P.ersonalised \nM.edicine, I.T, G.enomics, to name but a few. Changes were appearing on these \nmechanisms too, but the observers couldn\u2019t say if the changing was related to E. How \nwere they going to report in simple terms such an immense, constantly moving, \ninterconnected frenzy of relationships and differences, wires and gears? Each gear in \nitself was a rich intricate lace. Their notebooks were filling up with data, text, \nnumbers, sketches, as they tried to capture the flow of events and changes in progress. \nIt seemed it was not possible to observe the makeup of the flow itself but clearly it \nwas vital to the operation of the machine. They struggled to see the simplicity the \nscientists had presented, so enthralled they were by the system\u2019s complexity. Perhaps \nthey could have interpreted the machine low-pitched murmuring \u2013 the very voice of \nthe machine itself - but they lacked the ears to hear it126. What were they missing, the \nwhole for the gears? Were they focusing on the right layers? Where were the \noutcomes? More observation work was necessary.  \nThe observers split into groups. The youngest gave themselves more precise tasks, \ncapturing with stopwatchers accurate timings of the flow and speed of dials. The most \nseniors took a mimal out of their toolbox \u2013 the handheld micromagnetolens that had \nbeen applied in many successful projects before to produce real time pictographic \nrepresentations of the combined smaller-and-bigger picture. Gears, pipes and wires \nwere coming in and out of focus. They tried positioning themselves at a different \nangle on the shifting platform. If only the ground would stop moving - their work \nwould be much easier. \n \nAs the scientists were attempting to repair the reaction mechanisms in P, they saw \nthat M was having an increased effect on the whole system. They knew there was a \nrisk but they didn\u2019t think it would reveal itself so soon. Critical mass \u2013 and time - is \nneeded usually before such transformations take place. M\u2019s power was increasingly \ninfluencing P\u2019s behaviour now that E had freed P from D\u2019s control. P was freely \nturning towards F, generating an exponential growth of M and corresponding value of \nL. The scientists tried to intervene on F by pulling a few levers, but with limited \neffect. Humming and glowing, the machine had found a new equilibrium, leading to a \nsteady and more fluid growth of M and a more rapid turning of P, but no signs yet of \ndramatic change in the health of the nation, or energy saving. The readoscope \nprintouts were now showing alarming figures of L and risks for P, but no alarm bells \nwere ringing. The scientists stood back to discuss the variables in the mathematical \nmodel. So much for the mathematicians22 \u2026  \n \nThe observers were still at work and had not realised the experiment had ended. It \nseemed changes were still in progress, the machine was still moving. They did notice \nthough that the scientists had stopped working on the machine, and they took the \nopportunity to ask a few clarifications. Why was E implemented? An easy straight-\nforward question. \nThe scientists looked at each other. Apparently the reasons had kept changing as \nthe years passed and the project developed, and nobody could recall why it had \nbegun. But they were sure it could be done \u2013 it was technically feasible and therefore \ndesirable; a certain technical improvement to the system. In fact, the experiment had \ndemonstrated its success, with the machine moving more fluidly, smoothly - more \nefficiently.  \n \n*** \n \nThe observers were on their capsule back to Earth. The night stared them in the \nface, amorphous, blind, infinite, without frontiers26. Travelling gave them a quiet time \nto write their report. Unfortunately the assiduous efforts of so many years had not \nresulted in a single indisputable conclusion23. They were concerned, but they were \nback down to Earth. Looking back, they could see that they had flown to DOR not so \nmuch to observe the experiment but to acquaint themselves with the machine.  With a \nmuffled sigh of resignation, the spaceship expelled its hot air. They were free5. \n3   Reflections \nPostmodernist critical theory suggests reflexivity as one way in which researchers can \ncome to terms with their own research circumstances [11], [12]. Reflexivity \u201caims at \ninterpretation, open, language sensitive, identity-conscious, historical, political, non-\nauthoritative and textually aware understanding of the subject matter\u201d [13]. It \nconcerns recognizing the ambivalent relationship of the research texts and evidence to \nthe realities studied [14] and focuses on the researcher themselves and their \nexperience. Yet a significant constraint to such research practices is the act of writing \nacademic papers. The traditional academic paper \u201cdefines some limits of our writing\u201d \n[12] and reflexive research should seek alternative writing styles in order to explore \nthe social, historical and political context of their research [15] - in particular to \nexplore the tacit dimension [16] of research knowledge which researchers develop in \ntheir experience of the field. For perhaps it is the duty of all researchers to come to \nterms with their own circumstances \u201cbefore allowing [themselves] the arrogant luxury \nof disengaged pronouncements on the circumstances of others\u201d [15] of [11].   \n \nFor this reason we here explore the writing of explicit fiction as a means to elaborate \nour research \u201creality\u201d and come to terms with our own research circumstances \ndrawing on our reflexive understanding \u2013 but expressly avoiding \u201cfacts\u201d and factual \ntext. As \u201cevery reality depends upon the ceaseless reflexive use of a body of \nknowledge in interaction\u201d [17] so the authoring of this fictional account provided an \nopportunity to reify and discuss dissatisfaction, concern, and self-critique within EPS \nand within our EPS evaluation project. Ensuring a focus away from the specifics of \nthe current research project and creating projections and extrapolations \u2013 fiction \u2013 and \nespecially the sci-fi genre based in the future [18] \u2013 avoids or reifies ethical and moral \nconcerns so allowing them to be expanded upon but in a less threatening manner \n(though interestingly we were asked to highlight the disclaimer on the fictional nature \nof the piece).  \nOur fictional account is an exercise in futureology \u2013 it is inspired by the novel \nSolaris [1], by a socio-technical view of the world [19] and by Peter Checkland\u2019s \nSoft-Systems thinking [20]. The text is clearly and explicitly not of this world, of this \ntime, of this reality, and thus cannot be seen as a direct representation of our research \nproject. Writing science fiction provided us with the freedom from our own inner \nacademic self-censor. Our story is \u2018retro\u2019: \u2018a sci-fi vision from the 1950s about a \nsocial and political reality now\u2019 (as one reader described it). The story is about our \nnow, and in particular our problems today in identifying outcomes. It is science \nfiction, but like all science fiction it is based on the social reality of the present \u2013 for \nwhy else would it be possible to have retro-sci-fi?  \nSimilarly to writing about the future, researching the future is also always based on \nthe present, or rather the \u201cremembered past\u201d [21]. In a dialectical perspective, \n\u201cwhether studying the past or the future, it is chiefly a matter of looking back, \nderiving presuppositions from the forms that contain them\u201d [22]. Just as the hindsight \nbias skews any research of the past, so the past skews any projection of the future. \nLook in either direction and the researcher can only see the present. \nSolaris was chosen as the basis for our story for its literary strengths and \nconceptual rather than narrative or plot based structure, and yet this novel can offer us \nan additional layer for reflection. The book recounts the story of four men in a space-\nstation, on a planet \u2013 Solaris \u2013 made of a live ocean-like creature with whom Man has \nbeen striving to establish contact for centuries. Human theories and models of the \nocean fill the space-station\u2019s library. The ocean resounds like an amorphous, \nthreatening, marvelous, incomprehensible being. It is a psychological story, as the \nocean communicates with the four men by presenting them embodiments of their own \nmost remote remorse hidden in their subconscious. We read it as an epistemological \ntale: humans are unable to communicate with an entity that they can only know and \ndescribe through the humans\u2019 own theories and nomenclature (our hermeneutic bind \u2013 \nthat we are limited by our socially constructed language); the positivism of the \nSolarian scientists is replaced by the skepticism over their possible achievements and \nthe limitations of the human minds. The ocean is a multiple metaphor \u2013 in this case \none of our attempt to research the present\/future of EPS, or the observers\u2019 attempt to \ndraw outcomes out of the E experiment on the machine of DOR.   \nWhen facing the E, the observers found themselves in a struggle to know and judge \nits effect on the system. Technology is embedded in complex socio-technical systems; \nit is not neutral [23]; it affects\/is affected by the relations that surround it and the \nexpressed intentions for its coming to be, the expressed goals, might easily turn into \n\u2018unexpected\u2019\/\u2019unwanted\u2019 ones (the fiction writer Stanislaw Lem calls this effect the \n\u2018bifurcation of goals\u2019 [24]). The view of the whole is complex, and made more \ncomplex, and both more and less knowable, by an interpretative perspective.  \nIn contrast the \u201cscientists\u201d in our story had a clearer purpose and a narrower \nperspective; a pragmatic approach \u2018to get the job done\u2019. Perhaps we should have \ncalled them engineers, as engineers \u2018design and build\u2019, while in science fiction, \nespecially movies, scientists \u201c[b]eing a clearly labeled species of intellectual [\u2026] are \nalways liable to crack up or go off the deep end.\u201d [25].  \nAs researchers we find ourselves in dilemmas that leave behind an inability to act. \nThe question is how to overcome them and contribute shaping the technology of our \npresent and future. The difficulty is that what is required is often an answer to \u2018trans-\nscientific questions\u2019, ethical questions not answerable with science [26]; a matter of \nchoice, trade-offs, power, values, accountability. Often we are under considerable \npressure to provide simple rational answers \u2013 and to be servants of the powerful \nsponsors of research [27]. We must at least attempt to resist.  \n4   Post-script \nThis fictional piece was inspired by research undertaken to evaluate the Electronic \nPrescription Service (EPS), a Connecting for Health Project, part of the NHS National \nProgramme for IT (NPfIT). This paper is a creative reflexive account of \n\u2018researching the future\u2019 inspired by the work carried out for the Evaluation of \nthe Electronic Prescription Service in Primary Care (CFHEP004). We must \nexplicitly state that this account is not, and cannot be interpreted as, a direct \nrepresentation of the NHS Electronic Prescription Service or pre-empt the \noutcomes of the independent evaluation still in progress.  \n \nEPS builds on a set of electronic messaging functionalities newly implemented in \nexisting prescribers and dispensers\u2019 software applications already available on the \nmarket (i.e. electronic patient records systems currently used in GP surgeries and \npharmacies). The programme is developed in a series of releases: the purpose of EPS-\nRelease 1 was mainly to introduce and test the infrastructure; at the time of writing, \nEPS-Release 2 compliant systems\/functionalities are in the testing phase and getting \nready for wider roll-out. Release 2 will introduce electronic signatures and potentially \nreplace paper prescriptions. More information on EPS can be found on the NHS \nwebsite [28].  \nThe Evaluation of EPS focuses on Release 2. It is an independent research project \nstructured in four different work-packages, aimed at assessing different aspects on \nEPS, including: safety of dispensing, changes of work practices in doctors surgeries \nand pharmacies, views of patients, effects on the wider context (e.g. market \nstructures). The different themes are investigated with a mix of qualitative and \nquantitative research methods, including observations, interviews, participants\u2019 self-\nreported activities, task analysis, stakeholder mapping, etc. The wider EPS context \nhas been the subject of semi-structured face-to-face interviews with representatives of \nprescribers, dispensers, software suppliers and other stakeholders. Thirty \ninterviews\/meetings were conducted between June 2009 \u2013 July 2010. The process of \nidentifying and mapping stakeholders has been described and discussed in [29]. \nResearch is still in progress at the time of writing. \n \nAcknowledgments.  \nThe EPS evaluation project is lead by the School of Pharmacy\/University of London, \nin collaboration with the University of Nottingham and the London School of \nEconomics and Political Sciences.
