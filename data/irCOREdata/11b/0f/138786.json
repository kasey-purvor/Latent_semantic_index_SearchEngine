With the exception of skin cancers,\nprostate cancer is the most common cancer in man. Prostate cancer is the second leading\ncause of cancer death in men in the United States, exceeded only by lung cancer. Prostate\ncancer accounts for about 10% of cancer-related deaths in men.\nPSA is a serine protease composed of a single chain glycoprotein. The molecular weight\nof PSA, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(SDS-PAGE), is approximately 33-34 kD. It is composed of 237 amino acids, with a mol.\nwt. of 26,079 for the peptide moiety of the molecule [1]. PSA in human body is mainly\nbound to alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) as a complex form and the remaining PSA is\nin the free form (f-PSA). The total amount of bound PSA and f-PSA is known as total\nPSA (t-PSA).\nA number of epitopes are present on PSA allowing the development of sandwich assays\nusing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies that can measure both free PSA and PSA-\nACT [2]. Prostate cancer is present in half of all patients having PSA-ACT at more than\n4 ng mL-1 and 70% at more than 10 ng mL-1 [3]. Thus PSA-ACT levels of 4.0 ng mL-1 or\nhigher are strong indicators of the possibility of prostate cancer (CAP). Elevated serum\nPSA levels have also been attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PSA\nelevations may also occur with aging and with conditions such as prostatitis [4]. Thus\nhigh level of t-PSA may lead to a large percentage of false positive screening results.\nA potential solution to this problem involves the determination of f-PSA levels. The ratio\nof f-PSA to t-PSA is very important in the screening of BPH from CAP [5]. The serum\ndetermination of the f-PSA \/ t-PSA ratio is an excellent index of prostate carcinoma.\n4Stancik et al. [6] showed that the ratio can differentiate BPH from CAP. Table 1 [7] will\nshow the probability of cancer with % of f-PSA.\nBesselink and others [8] have developed surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based sensor\nfor detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) using colloidal gold and latex\nmicrospheres (120 nm diameter) on planar- and gel-type sensor surfaces. Application of\ncolloidal gold led to a sensitivity increase of approximately three orders of magnitude\ncompared with no amplified detection. They achieved a limit of detection of 0.15 ng mL-1\nof PSA, which is sufficient for measuring enhanced, clinically relevant PSA levels. They\nhowever measured t-PSA.\nA two-step immunoassay was designed by Soukka and others [9] to measure free\nprostate-specific antigen (PSA) using europium(III) chelate nanoparticles coated with a\nmonoclonal anti-PSA antibody. The assay was performed in a low-fluorescence\nmicrotitration well passively coated with an another monoclonal anti-PSA antibody and\nthe europium(III) fluorescence was measured directly from the bottom of the well by a\nstandard time-resolved microtitration plate fluorometer. Wu and his coworkers [10] have\ndeveloped a PSA sensor by attaching PSA antibodies to a gold-coated silicon nitride\nmicrocantilever. They described the cantilever as \"a microscopic diving-board-shaped\nmechanical structure.\" A sample containing PSA was flown over the microcantilever\nsurface. The binding of PSA to the antibodies caused a deflection in the microcantilever\nthat could be measured using a laser beam. They were able to detect PSA over a\nconcentration range of 0.2 ng mL-1 to 60 \u00b5g mL-1.\nA particle-based renewable electrochemical magnetic immunosensor was developed by\nLin Guodong and Lin Yuche [11] using magnetic beads and gold nanoparticle labels.\n5Anti-IgG antibody-modified magnetic beads were attached to a renewable carbon paste\ntransducer surface by magnet that was fixed inside the sensor. Gold nanoparticle labels\nwere capsulated to the surface of magnetic beads by sandwich immunoassay. The\nstripping signal of gold nanoparticles was related to the concentration of target IgG in the\nsample solution. The detection limit of 0.02 g mL-1 of IgG was obtained under optimum\nexperimental conditions.\nFernandez-Sanchez et al. [12] developed a one-step lateral flow immunoassay on a strip\nformat for detection of serum levels of free and total prostate specific antigen. The\nperformance of the system described relied on non-competitive immunoassay protocols.\nHerein, f-PSA and t-PSA were sandwiched between anti-f-PSA and anti-t-PSA\nmonoclonal antibodies immobilised on the strip and a colloidal gold anti-PSA antibody\ntracer. In the presence of PSA in the sample, the tracer accumulated on the strip results in\nthe appearance of specific pink colour lines. A semi-quantitative estimation could be\ncarried out visually. Quantitative analysis was also possible by densitometry. The\ndetection limit was 1 ng mL-1.\nImmunoradiometric assay is based on the reversible and non-covalent binding of an\nantigen by a specific antibody labeled with a radioactive nuclide as a tracer. Kocha\u0144ska-\nDziurowicz and coworkers [13] used immunoradiometric assay using Iodine125 labeled\nanti-psa. The diagnostic kit was manufactured by Euro-DPC Ltd. Llanberis, UK.\nJochen et.al. [Jochen Peter1, Carlo Unverzagt2, Thomas N. Krogh, Ole Vorm and\nWolfgang Hoesel, Identification of Precursor Forms of Free Prostate-specific Antigen in\nSerum of Prostate Cancer Patients by Immunosorption and Mass Spectrometry, Cancer\n6Research 61, 957-962, February 1, 2001] isolated f-PSA from serum using streptavidin\ncoated magnetic beads and estimated f-PSA by mass spectrometry.\nIn this presentation we describe a method of immunoassay for f-PSA using the magnetic\nbead. Particle-based electrochemical magnetic immunosensors can be readily used for\ndisease diagnostics. The method is unique compared to other methods since it combines\nthe efficiency of the separation by magnetic beads and sensitivity of electrochemical\nmeasurement. This method is also an improved one in many respects compared to our\nearlier work on t-PSA [14]. The method uses immunoassay product on the sensor surface\nrather than performing it on the electrode, avoiding interference. The separation of the\nimmunoasasay product was made easy by use of magnet\/magnetic beads. The detection\nlimit is also much higher (<0.1 ng mL-1). The method is very convenient and the\ndetection may be carried out in non-laboratory locations with simple hand held\ninstruments. The method was tested by hand held potentiostat (Whistonbrook\nTechnologies Limited, Bedfordshire, UK). The antibody-coated magnetic beads have a\nshelf life of several months.\nMATERIALS\nHuman prostate specific antigen (PSA), monoclonal antibodies to total PSA (clone:\nA45510259P and A45080020P), conjugates and a test kit containing PSA in human\nserum were purchased from Biospacific, CA, USA. All chemicals for preparation of\nbuffer, horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP), biotinylated HRP, 3,3\u2019 5,5\u2019-,tetramethyl\nbenzidine (TMB), 0.01M Phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH- 7.4, 0.137M NaCl) were\nsupplied by Sigma Chemical Co Ltd, Poole, Dorset, UK and used as received.\nHydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) was supplied by Fluka, (Gillingham, Dorset, UK).\n7Dynabeads \u00aeM-280 Tosylactivated and streptavidin coated dynabeads were supplied by\nDynal Biotech., USA.\nEXPERIMENTAL\nThis paper presents amperometric detection procedure for PSA using a three-electrode\nscreen-printed sensor. The benefits of using screen-printed electrodes is that they can be\nmass-manufactured at low cost and thus can be considered \u2018one-shot\u2019 single-use devices,\nthereby negating the problems of electrode regeneration required when using\nconventional solid state electrode materials. The immunoassays were based on a\nsandwich assay formats. Three different schemes were followed. They are shown in\nFigures 1, 2 and 3. In scheme I and III the magnetic beads were coated with anti-PSA\nantibody that could bind specifically to ACT-bound epitope or free epitope of PSA\nrespectively. In scheme II the magnetic beads were coated with ACT that could bind with\nfree epitope of PSA. In all the three schemes, a tracer material consisting of anti-PSA\nantibody (with specificity towards a second epitope on the target analyte) coupled to HRP\nenzyme was used to tag bead bound PSA. Following bead recovery by the use of a\nmagnetic particle concentrator (Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway), unbound material\nwas washed from the system. The Dynal MPC-15 magnetic particle concentrator contains\nan acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastic housing incorporating high-energy\nneodymium magnets. The beads recovered were placed on the working electrode of the\n3-electrode assembly. Enzyme (HRP) activity on the beads would be proportional to the\namount of PSA present in the sample and this was determined by addition of enzyme\nsubstrate through the resultant production of electro active product. In this work,\nhydrogen peroxide was used as HRP substrate. HRP reduces the hydrogen peroxide with\n8concomitant oxidation of an electron donor (mediator, in this case TMB), the reducing\nequivalents being transferred to TMB via the enzyme active site. The mediator was re-\nreduced by accepting electrons from a suitably poised electrode. The resultant current is\nrelated to the amount of HRP, hence analyte present. The beads were held firmly on the\nsurface of the working electrode by a Neodymium rare earth magnet (N42 disk magnet;\n0.5\"D x 0.25\"T, Indigo Instruments, NY).\nWashing of magnetic beads\nThe magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280) are uniform supermagnetic polystyrene beads\ncoated with a polyurethane layer. The polyurethane surface is activated by p-\ntoluenesulphonyl chloride [15] that provides reactive groups for covalent binding of\nproteins (e.g. antibodies) or other ligands containing primary amino or sulphydryl groups.\nThe standard protocol provided with the kit was followed to wash the magnetic beads\nbefore coating them with the anti-PSA antibody.\nThree buffer solutions were prepared to follow the protocol.\nBuffer A (0.1 M Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.4): 2.62 g Na H2 PO4 x H2 O (MW 137.99)\n14.42 g Na2 HPO4 x 2H2 O (MW 177. 99) were dissolved in reverse osmosis (RO) water\nand the volume was adjusted to 1000 ml.\nBuffer B (PBS pH 7.4 (phosphate buffered saline) with 0.1% (w\/v) BSA): 0.88 g NaCl\n(MW 58.4) and 0.1% (w\/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) were added to 80 ml 0.01 M\nNa-phosphate pH 7.4. They were mixed thoroughly and the volume was adjusted to 100\nml with 0.01 M Na-phosphate pH 7.4.\nBuffer C (0.2 M Tris pH 8.5 with 0.1% (w\/v) BSA): 2.42 g Tris was dissolved in 80 ml\nRO water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.5 using 1 M HCl. 0.1% BSA was\nadded and the volume of the solution was adjusted to 100 ml.\n9Dynabeads were resuspended in it\u2019s container for approximately 1 min using a vortex\nmixer. Measured volume (107 beads per sample of 3\uf06dg) of suspension was pipetted out\ninto a micro-centrifuge tube. The tube was placed on a magnetic concentrator (Dynal\nMPC) until the beads migrated to the side of the tube and the liquid was clear. The\nsupernatant was discarded. The beads were washed carefully in ample volume of buffer\nA for 2 minutes. The beads were recovered by the magnetic concentrator and used for\ncoating.\nCoating of magnetic beads\nAntibody or ACT solution in buffer A (3\u00b5g antibody or ACT per 107 Dynabeads) was\nadded to the washed dynabeads and mixed for 1 minute. It was incubated for 24 h at\n25\u00b0C with slow tilt rotation. After incubation, the tube was placed on the magnetic\nconcentrator until the beads concentrated on the side of the tube, and the supernatant was\nremoved. The coated beads were then washed four times, twice in buffer B for 5 minutes\nat +4\u00b0C, once in Buffer C for 24 h at +20\u00b0C and finally in buffer B for 5 minutes at +4\u00b0C.\nThe coated Dynabeads were thus made ready for use.\nConstruction of screen-printed electrode\nDevices were printed onto 250 \uf06dm thick polyester sheet (Cadillac Plastic Ltd., Swindon,\nUK). The circular electrocatalytic working electrode was fabricated from a commercially\navailable carbon powder (MCA Services Ltd., Cambs. UK), made into a screen-printable\npaste by mixing 1:3 (w\/w) with 2.5% w\/v HEC in PBS. The reference electrode ink\ncontained 15% w\/w silver chloride in silver paste [16] (MCA). The counter electrode and\nbasal tracks used to connect the electrodes to the measurement device were fabricated\nfrom I45R carbon ink (MCA). The basal tracks were insulated from the measurement\nsolution using an epoxy-based protective coating ink 242-SB (Agmet ESL Ltd., Reading,\n10\nUK). The electrodes were then heat treated at 125\u00baC for 2 hours to cure the epoxy resin\nand to stabilize the electro-catalytic pad to allow prolonged use of the device in aqueous\nsolutions [17]. Figure 4 shows the detailed schematic of the screen-printed electrode.\nDetailed Procedure\nCyclic voltammetry was first performed to ascertain the appropriate potential for the HRP\ninitiated redox reaction of hydrogen peroxide in presence of TMB. The optimum\ndetection potential for reduction of hydrogen peroxide was selected as \u2013100 mV (Figure\n5). To find the optimum concentration of TMB substrate solution, different amounts of\nHRP were dissolved in the same buffer containing 1% v\/v glutaraldehyde and 10\uf06dl\nvolumes of this solution were deposited on the working electrodes of the sensors. The\nbifunctional activity of glutaraldehyde served as a means of cross-linking the HRP\nprotein onto the carbon working electrode surface. Amperometry was performed at -100\nmV. After electrochemical equilibration, 10 \uf06dl of 50% v\/v TMB stock solution was\nadded and response was noted. The effect of TMB solution concentration on\namperometric response was studied across a range of HRP activities (0-30 mU, Figure 6).\nTo confirm whether magnetic beads could be used for immunoassay on the screen-\nprinted electrode, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were used for conjugation with\nbiotinylated HRP and used on the electrode for response of the HRP. As the basic\nobjective of the method was to measure low concentration of HRP tagged bead-bound\nPSA using TMB solution, experiments were performed to find the detection limit for\nHRP. A stock solution of 1.2 mg of HRP-biotin was prepared in PBS and aliquots from\nthis stock solution were diluted as appropriate. Initially 0.1 mg quantities of streptavidin-\ncoated beads were transferred to 0.5 ml tubes and the volume made up to 100 \uf06dl with\nPBS. After thorough mixing, the beads were separated by a magnetic concentrator and\n11\nthe supernatant was removed. This process was repeated once more in order to wash the\nbeads. A proper aliquot of diluted HRP-biotin solution was added to provide the desired\nHRP activity. The magnetic beads were washed thrice by buffer after incubation for one\nhour at 200C. Volumes (10 \uf06dl) of the final bead mixture were prepared by adding 100\uf06dl\nof PBS containing 1% v\/v gluteraldehyde and deposited on the WE and dried at 40 C. The\ndried electrodes were tested amperometrically with 100 \uf06dl 50% v\/v TMB stock solution\nin PBS at -100mV as described earlier (Figure 7). The beads coated with t-PSA-Mab\n(scheme I)\/ ACT (scheme II)\/ f-PSA-Mab (scheme III) were divided into 5 equal portions\nto which were added 20 \uf06dL of f-PSA solutions of 5 different concentrations (0.1, 0.25,\n0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 ng mL-1). These preparations were incubated for 6 hours to allow\nspecific binding of f-PSA to the Mab. After separation of beads and washing with buffer\nA, the conjugate f-PSA-Mab-HRP (scheme-I)\/ t-PSA-Mab-HRP (scheme II and III) was\nadded in excess (200\uf06dl) to each aliquot and incubated for 6 hours. The beads were again\nwashed with buffer A and subjected to amperometric study.\nFollowing the immunoassay, the magnetic beads were placed directly on the working\nelectrode of a 3 electrode screen-printed sensor. A powerful magnet was placed\nunderneath the working electrode to ensure proper retention of the magnetic beads on the\nworking electrode. 90\uf06dL volume of 6 mM potassium iodide in PBS was applied to the\nelectrodes (within the circular aperture defined by the insulation layer) and amperometry\nperformed at -0.1 V (versus the Ag\/AgCl reference electrode). After equilibration of the\nelectrochemical response, a 50% dilution of the TMB stock solution was added and the\nelectrochemical current response noted at 120 s.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n12\nFigure 6 shows the improvement of response with increasing TMB mediator\nconcentration. But the increase in response was not appreciable above 50% TMB\nsolution. We have chosen 50% TMB solution for estimation of f-PSA as a tradeoff\nbetween cost of reagent and response. Thus optimum concentration was chosen as 50%\nv\/v of the supplied TMB stock solution. Figure 7 indicates that there is a steady\napparently first-order increase in device response up to 8 \uf06dU HRP, and a tendency\ntowards a zero order saturated response as the enzyme loading is increased to 100 \uf06dU per\nelectrode. The limit of detection with respect to enzyme loading, was calculated as 0.24\n\uf06dU in accordance with the IUPAC convention. Hence it was considered this detection\nsystem had merit with respect to the estimation of f-PSA using HRP-labeled antibody.\nFurther an experiment following Sarkar et al. [14] was conducted by performing the\nimmunoassay for f-PSA right on the electrode to check the response and consider if there\nwas a necessity for magnetic beads to improve performance. The response of f-PSA was\nstudied in the absence of PSA-ACT complex. A 4\uf020\uf06dl volume of f-PSA-Mab was\nimmobilized on the working electrode of a 3 electrode screen-printed sensor using\nglutaraldehyde. Following Mab immobilisation, 4 \uf06dl volumes of f-PSA solution of\ndifferent concentrations (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 ng mL-1) were applied to the biosensor, incubated\nfor 24 h, and washed. 16 \uf06dl f-PSA-Mab-HRP solution was then added to the Mab-f-PSA\ncomplex, incubated for 24 h and washed. The response was measured with 50% TMB-\nH2O2 solution as substrate (Figure 8). The graph indicates only 20 nA response for\naddition of 1.6 ng mL-1 of f-PSA. As we needed detection limit of less than 0.25ngmL-1.\nof f-PSA (Lower limit of f-PSA being around 0.25 ngmL-1which is 10 % of amount of t-\nPSA i.e., 2.6 ngmL-1) to ascertain the ratio of f-PSA to t-PSA, hence prostate carcinoma,\n13\nthis method did not serve the purpose and consequently we switched over to the magnetic\nbead route.\nDifferent schemes were followed in order to determine an optimum approach towards f-\nPSA determination using the magnetic beads.\nFigure 9 shows the response obtained in the presence of different concentrations of f-PSA\naccording to scheme I. A linear response in the range of 0 ng mL-1 to 1.0 ng mL-1 f-PSA\nhas been obtained.\nFigure 10 shows the responses obtained due to the presence of different concentrations of\nf-PSA according to schemes II and III. A linear response in the range of 0 ng mL-1 to 1.0\nng mL-1 f-PSA is evident.\nTo test whether the system works in a mixture of f-PSA and PSA-ACT (as would be the\ncase when dealing with clinical samples) measurements have been performed for\ndetermination of f-PSA in a mixture of f-PSA and PSA-ACT. Five different mixtures\ncontaining equal volumes of f-PSA and PSA-ACT complex at different concentrations\nwere prepared as shown in Table 2. Scheme I might be used for both t-PSA and pure f-\nPSA. Thus to determine the concentration of f-PSA in a mixture of f-PSA and PSA-ACT\nthis scheme is not suitable. On the other hand scheme II and III could be valid for only f-\nPSA and thus were chosen for determining f-PSA in t-PSA. The responses obtained for f-\nPSA in samples of t-PSA as per Table 2 using scheme II and III are shown in Figure 11.\nTo ascertain that the methods used are also suitable for mixtures of f-PSA and PSA-ACT,\na comparison of the device response to pure f-PSA and f-PSA\/PSA-ACT mixtures is\nshown in Figure 12. It is seen that the slopes of the linear trend lines are almost unity.\nThus there was practically no interference in determining f-PSA in presence of PSA-\n14\nACT. Table 3 depicts an overall comparison of f-PSA sensors. This work presents\nimprovement in major four aspects e.g. detection limit, cost, interference, usability.\nCONCLUSIONS\nA quantitative magnetic bead based ELISA sandwich immunoassay, with electrochemical\ndetermination of enzyme label activity at screen-printed electrodes has been\ndemonstrated for the detection of f-PSA. The benefit of this retention procedure is that,\nno cross-linking agent or polymer membrane is required compared to standard\nelectrochemical immunosensor devices. Also the electrode does not come into contact\nwith the sample medium and hence is not prone to electrode fouling or interference\nproblems. The detection method is simple and has potential to be used as a medical\ndiagnostic tool. Three formats are reported here, each capable of detecting f-PSA to\nlevels less than 0.1 ng\/ml. A significant improvement in device performance is evident\ndue to the use of magnetic beads as opposed to immobilizing immunoreagents to the\nscreen-printed working electrode surface and performing the assay directly at the\ntransducer surface. It is simple to perform using low cost reagents and detection\nmethodologies coupled to sensitivities several-fold higher than the conventional\ncolorimetric method.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors PS and RK are grateful to the Wellcome Trust for their grant (No. 064323).\nREFERENCES\n[1] B.G.
