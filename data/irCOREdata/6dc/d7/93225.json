There have been numerous approaches to mod-\nelling liquidity risk over the years, and the literature on illiquid financial markets\ncan roughly be divided into two categories: (i) studies on the effect of a large\ntrader, and (ii) studies on price impact due to immediacy provision by market\nmakers. The research falling into the first category studies the implications of a\nlarge trader who can move the asset prices by his actions on pricing and hedging.\n1\nIn the discrete-time model of Jarrow [9] the asset price depends on the holdings\nof the large trader via a certain reaction function. This paper studies the suffi-\ncient conditions to rule out the arbitrage opportunities for the large trader and\nanalyze the optimal hedging strategies as well. Frey [5], Frey & Stremme [6], and\nPlaten & Schweizer [11] study hedging strategies for the large trader in similar\nreaction settings in continuous time. Cuoco & Cvitanic` [3] and Cvitanic` & Ma\n[4] study a diffusion model for the price dynamics where the indirect feedback\neffect is modelled by making the drift and volatility coefficients depend on the\nlarge trader\u2019s trading strategy. Recently, Bank and Baum [1] extended Jarrow\u2019s\nresult to continuous time using tools from Kunita\u2019s non-linear integral. Liquidity\ncost as the market maker\u2019s cost of providing immediacy is introduced into the\nliterature by Grossmann and Miller [7] in a model for determining the equilibrium\nlevel of liquidity in a market.\nOur approach in this paper is related to a couple of more recent contributions,\nC\u00b8etin, Jarrow & Protter [2] and Rogers & Singh [14], that could fit into the\nsecond category of research as outlined above. Although the formulations of the\nliquidity costs are different, due to different limiting arguments for the liquidity\ncosts incurred by the continuous strategies, the common approach adopted in\nboth is based on equalisation of supply and demand in the short-term market\nwhich is relevant if an agent is attempting to trade large volumes in a short time.\nAs this market is localised in time, prices paid do not impact prices at other\ntimes when there is no abnormal buying or selling pressure. This has the strong\nadvantage that the actions of agents do not influence prices except at the times\nwhen they are trading, with the result that the price process of the share has a\ndynamic that is not influenced by the actions of the agent. This is important\npractically and conceptually because if the actions of one agent affect the share\nprice, then the actions of all agents must be allowed to affect the share price, and\nthe analysis of such a complex system becomes impractical.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we set out the modelling\nassumptions. An agent trades in an illiquid market with the aim of maximising\nhis expected utility of terminal wealth; when he changes his portfolio, the price\nhe pays for the stock is the notional price plus a liquidity cost, which enters like\na non-linear transaction cost1.\nMaximising expected utility of terminal wealth in a liquid market is of interest\nfor a number of reasons. Firstly, there is the result (well known to economists)\nthat if an optimum can be achieved then the marginal utility of optimal wealth\nis a state-price density; see, for example, the expository article [13] which gives\na sketch of the ideas, and [12] for a proof of the discrete-time Fundamental The-\norem of Asset Pricing using exactly this approach. More generally, Kramkov\n1See Rogers & Singh [14] for a derivation of this modelling idea.\n2\n& Schachermayer [10] and others examine the maximisation of expected utility\nof terminal wealth in the context of a general semimartingale model; the sim-\nple results of the economists need to be modified in subtle ways. Secondly, the\nmaximisation of expected utility of terminal wealth can be used as a way of deter-\nmining utility-indifference prices in an incomplete market, following the seminal\npaper of Hodges & Neuberger [8].\nHow are these results affected by including liquidity effects? We shall show that\nunder certain mild conditions the optimisation of expected utility of terminal\nwealth does have a solution; and that the marginal utility of optimal terminal\nwealth is an equivalent martingale measure. However, in the transformed mea-\nsure, the process which becomes the martingale is not the (notional) stock price\nprocess, but rather the marginal price process, that is, the price to be paid per\nunit for an infinitesimal extra amount of the stock. Looking at the simple argu-\nment preceding Theorem 4.1, this is hardly surprising. Moreover, no hypothesis\nof absence of arbitrage is needed, unlike the liquid case; again, this is not surpris-\ning when one realises that under strictly convex liquidity costs there is limited\nscope to exploit an arbitrage because of the increasing costs of taking ever larger\npositions in the advantageous portfolio.\nThe final part of our paper takes a simple example of the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein\nbinomial model with liquidity effects, and an agent with CARA utility (as usual,\nthis is done for numerical tractability in that the dimension of the problem reduces\nby 1; more general utilities could in principle be dealt with, but this example\nserves already to illustrate various properties). We find reservation ask prices for\nsimple European put options, and see what hedging strategy is carried out by a\nliquidity-constrained agent. The appendix contains the proofs of the theorems\nthat are not given in the text.\n2 The modelling framework\nLet (\u2126,F , P ) be a probability space endowed with the filtration (Fn)0\u2264n\u2264N+1.\nAll the random variables and stochastic processes in this and subsequent sections\nwill be defined on this base. In a discrete time setting let (Sn)0\u2264n\u2264N denote the\nstrictly positive asset price process, which we shall suppose has the property\nSn \u2208 L1 \u2200n \u2264 N, (2.1)\nand is adapted to (Fn)0\u2264n\u2264N+1. Suppose that portfolio rebalancing occurs be-\ntween two time points; between time n\u2212 1 and time n, we change the number of\nshares held from Xn\u22121 to Xn, and the cash held changes from Yn\u22121 to\nYn = Yn\u22121 \u2212 \u03d5(\u2206Xn)Sn\u22121, (2.2)\n3\nwhere \u2206Xn \u2261 Xn \u2212 Xn\u22121. For now, assume that interest rates are zero. We\nfurther assume that Xn is Fn\u22121-measurable, which in turn implies the processes\nX and Y are previsible. We shall assume that \u03d5 : R \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e] is strictly\nconvex and strictly increasing where finite, and has the properties\ninf\nx\n\u03d5\u2032(x) = 0, sup\nx\n\u03d5\u2032(x) =\u221e, \u03d5(0) = 0. (2.3)\nWe define the concave dual function of \u03d5 by\n\u03d5\u02dc(w) \u2261 inf{\u03d5(x) + wx}. (2.4)\nWe suppose that an agent has the task of maximising EU(YN+1), where we\nunderstand that after SN is revealed, the agent liquidates his holding of the share,\nso that at time N +1 he has only cash. The utility function U : R\u2192 [\u2212\u221e,\u221e) is\nassumed to be strictly increasing and strictly concave in its domain of finiteness\nD = {x : U(x) > \u2212\u221e}. We also suppose the Inada conditions,\nsup\nx\u2208Do\nU \u2032(x) = +\u221e, inf\nx\u2208Do\nU \u2032(x) = 0, (2.5)\nwhere Do denotes the interior of D as a subset of the real line. Without loss of\ngenerality, we shall further suppose D = R.\nAt time n, the agent\u2019s optimisation problem can be thought of as choosing the\nprocess (\u2206Xj)\nN\nj=n+1 of changes of portfolio to be applied from the present time\nup to N . Once these are chosen, the cash value at time N + 1 is just\ny \u2212 \u03d5(\u2212x\u2212\nN\u2211\nj=n+1\n\u2206Xj)SN \u2212\nN\u2211\nj=n+1\n\u03d5(\u2206Xj)Sj\u22121,\nleading us to define\n\u03a6n(x, y, (\u2206X)) = U\n(\ny \u2212 \u03d5(\u2212x\u2212\nN\u2211\nj=n+1\n\u2206Xj)SN \u2212\nN\u2211\nj=n+1\n\u03d5(\u2206Xj)Sj\u22121\n)\n. (2.6)\nNow we define for each integer n \u2208 [0, N ]\nvn(x, y) \u2261 ess sup En[U(YN+1)|Xn = x, Yn = y ] (2.7)\n\u2261 ess sup En[\u03a6n(x, y, (\u2206X))],\nwhere En denotes the conditional expectation with respect to the \u03c3-field Fn, and\nthe essential supremum is taken over all previsible processes (\u2206X). Note that\nvn(x, y) is not a deterministic function but a random process for each (x, y). Thus\nfor example\nvN(x, y) = U(y \u2212 \u03d5(\u2212x)SN).\n4\nThere may be an issue of the sense in which vn is defined, in view of the un-\ncountably many values of (x, y) for each of which a conditional expectation is\nrequired. However, we shall suppose that vn is only defined in the first place for\ndyadic rational x and y; Proposition 2.1 will show that vn is a concave increasing\nfunction of its two arguments, and so will extend uniquely off the rationals to all\nreal (x, y).\nSo that we are not considering a vacuous question, we shall make the\nAssumption A: For all x, y, and for all n, vn(x, y) <\u221e, a.s.\nUnder this assumption, we have our first result.\nProposition 2.1 For each n, vn(x, y) is concave and increasing in x and y,\nalmost surely.\nProof. See Appendix.\n3 Existence of optimal hedging strategies.\nWe aim to prove in this section that the supremum in (2.7) is actually a maximum.\nFor this, it is helpful (though quite possibly unnecessary) to make the further\nAssumption B: For all n, for all t > 0, Sn\u03d5\u02dc(\u2212t\/Sn) \u2208 L1.\nNext define the convex dual functions\nv\u02dcn(\u03b7) \u2261 sup\nx,y\n{ vn(x, y)\u2212 \u03b71x\u2212 \u03b72y } (3.8)\nfor \u03b7 = (\u03b71, \u03b72) >> 0. By considering the case where x = 0, y = 1, and where\nwe use the suboptimal policy of never investing in the risky asset, we see that\nv\u02dcn(\u03b7) \u2265 U(1)\u2212 \u03b72, which is a constant lower bound. Before we bound v\u02dcn(\u03b7) from\nabove, note that for any (\u2206X), any x, y, we have (writing y\u2032 = y\u2212\u03d5(\u2206Xn)Sn\u22121,\nx\u2032 = x+\u2206Xn)\nEn[\u03a6n(x, y, (\u2206X))] = En\n[\nEn+1[U(y\n\u2032 \u2212 \u03d5(\u2212x\u2032 \u2212\nN\u2211\nn+2\n\u2206Xj)SN \u2212\nN\u2211\nn+2\n\u03d5(\u2206Xj)Sj\u22121)]\n]\n\u2264 En[vn+1(x\u2032, y\u2032)].\nKeeping this in mind, one can show\nLemma 3.1 For all n and for all \u03b7 >> 0,\nv\u02dcn(\u03b7) \u2264 \u2212\u03b72Sn\u03d5\u02dc(\u2212\u03b71\/\u03b72Sn) + Env\u02dcn+1(\u03b7).\n5\nProof. See Appendix.\nIt is simple to confirm that v\u02dcN(\u03b7) \u2208 L1 for any \u03b7 >> 0, and in view of Assumption\nB we deduce that v\u02dcn(\u03b7) \u2208 L1 for all n, for all \u03b7 >> 0. It follows immediately\nthat vn(x, y) \u2208 L1 for all x, y, for all n.\nNow if we fix \u03b7 >> 0\nvn(x, y) \u2264 sup\n\u2206x\nEnvn+1(x+\u2206x, y \u2212 \u03d5(\u2206x)Sn)\n\u2264 sup\n\u2206x\nEn[v\u02dcn+1(\u03b7) + \u03b71(x+\u2206x) + \u03b72(y \u2212 \u03d5(\u2206x)Sn)\n= Env\u02dcn+1(\u03b7) + \u03b71x+ \u03b72y + sup\n\u2206x\n[\u03b71\u2206x\u2212 \u03b72\u03d5(\u2206x)Sn]; (3.9)\nthe point of this is that the expression involving \u2206x in (3.9) tends to \u2212\u221e as\n\u2206x\u2192\u221e and as \u2206x\u2192 \u2212\u221e, so the supremum is actually a maximum. Thus, we\nhave the following theorem:\nTheorem 3.1 Suppose Assumptions A and B hold. Then, vn(x, y) \u2208 L1 for all\nn and x, y. Moreover, the solution to (2.7) is attained in the set of previsible\nprocesses, (X, Y ), such that Xn = x and Yn = y.\nOur next result is a Bellman equation in this setting which is made precise in the\nnext proposition.\nProposition 3.1 We have for 0 \u2264 n < N\nvn(x, y) = sup\n\u2206x\nEn[ vn+1(x+\u2206x, y \u2212 \u03d5(\u2206x)Sn) ]. (3.10)\nProof. See Appendix.\n4 Risk-neutral marginal pricing\nSuppose that we have Xn = x, Yn = y, and that the process (\u2206Xm)\nN\nm=n+1 is\noptimal for these particular initial values. We are going to consider a perturbation\n(\u2206X\n(\u03b5)\nm )Nm=n+1 of this optimal policy defined by\n\u2206X(\u03b5)m = \u03b5+\u2206Xn+1 (m = n+ 1)\n= \u2206Xm (m > n+ 1).\nAt time N + 1, the cash Y\n(\u03b5)\nN+1 under this new policy is\nY\n(\u03b5)\nN+1 = YN+1 \u2212 [\u03d5(\u2206X(\u03b5)n+1)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2206Xn+1)]Sn \u2212 [\u03d5(\u2212XN \u2212 \u03b5)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2212XN)]SN\n= YN+1 \u2212 [\u03d5(\u2206Xn+1 + \u03b5)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2206Xn+1)]Sn \u2212 [\u03d5(\u2212XN \u2212 \u03b5)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2212XN)]SN ,\n6\nwhich is clearly concave in \u03b5. Because of optimality, we know that for any \u03b5,\nEn[U(YN+1)] \u2265 En[U(Y (\u03b5)N+1)],\nso2 we learn that\nEn[U\n\u2032(YN+1)(\u03d5\u2032(\u2206Xn+1)Sn \u2212 \u03d5\u2032(\u2212XN)SN)] = 0. (4.11)\nIn summary, this says that the process3\nMn \u2261 \u03d5\u2032(\u2206Xn+1)Sn (4.12)\nis a martingale under the measure Q defined by\ndQ\ndP\n\u221d U \u2032(YN+1)\nThis heuristic argument leads to the following theorem whose proof is provided\nin the appendix.\nTheorem 4.1 Suppose Assumptions A and B hold and let the process (\u2206Xm)\nN\nm=n+1\nbe the optimal solution of vn(x, y) with the optimal terminal wealth YN+1.

Indeed, as the following example shows,\narbitrage opportunities and optimal portfolios could co-exist in an illiquid market.\nWe first make precise what we mean by an arbitrage opportunity.\n2... assuming we can differentiate inside the expectation! This needs justification, and is\ndealt with in Section A.1.\n3Is the process M defined by (4.12) integrable? We shall show in Section A.1 that it is.\n7\nDefinition 5.1 (X, Y ) is said to be an arbitrage opportunity if X and Y are\nprevisible processes with X0 = Y0 = XN+1 = 0, satisfying (2.2), and\nYN+1 \u2265 0 and P (YN+1 > 0) > 0.\nExample. Consider the one-period market where S0 = 1, \u03d5(x) = e\nx \u2212 1, and\nP (S1 = 1\/4) = P (S1 = 1\/2) = 1\/2. Choosing the initial trade x \u2208 (log 12 , 0) will\ngenerate cash\nY2 = (e\nx \u2212 1)(e\u2212xS1 \u2212 1)\nat time 2, which is strictly positive, therefore an arbitrage opportunity. Clearly,\nthis model satisfies Assumptions A and B; thus, given a utility function, the\noptimal portfolio exists. Note that a trading strategy in this model is buying x\nunits at time 0 and selling all at time 1. Thus, the associated marginal prices\nwith this strategy are ex at time 0 and e\u2212xS1 at time 1. The only way that\nthe marginal price process of this strategy is a martingale under some equivalent\nmeasure is when\ne\u2212x\n1\n4\n< ex and e\u2212x\n1\n2\n> ex,\nwhich can hold only if x \u2208 (log 1\n2\n, log 1\u221a\n2\n). Therefore, the optimal strategy with\nrespect to a given utility function always satisfies these bounds.\nCo-existence of arbitrage and the optimal strategy is due to the fact that infinite\narbitrage opportunities are not possible in an illiquid market in our sense.\n6 Numerical study\nIn this Section we consider an agent with utility\nU(x) = \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b3x),\nand the simple binomial model. We shall let Sn denote the stock price at time n,\nand suppose that S0 = 1. Given the value Sn\u22121 of the stock at time n\u22121, the value\nof the stock at time n is either uSn\u22121 with probability p \u2208 (0, 1) or dSn\u22121 with\nprobability q = 1\u2212p, where d < u. There is also a riskless money-market account,\nwhich grows by a factor r each period; in the conventional binomial model, we\nrequire that d < r < u to avoid arbitrage, but this is no longer necessary, since\nthe presence of liquidity costs will limit the possibilities for unbounded riskless\ngain.\nWe shall be concerned only with the pricing of European-style contingent claims,\nso the state-space of this system is a recombining lattice. If \u03be denotes one of\nthe nodes of this lattice, then \u03beu will denote the node one unit of time later\n8\nresulting from a favourable stock move (upward to uS), and \u03bed will denote the\nnode one unit of time later resulting from an unfavourable stock move. We shall\nwrite V\u03be(x) for the value to the agent of being at node \u03be and holding x units of\nstock, and zero units of the money-market account; the CARA form of the utility\npermits us to factor out the dependence on the money-market component, and\nleads to the Bellman equation\nV\u03be(x) = sup\n\u2206x\ne\u03b3\u03d5(\u2206x)S\u03ber\nm\n[pV\u03beu(x+\u2206x) + qV\u03bed(x+\u2206x)], (6.13)\nwhere m denotes the number of time steps from \u03beu to the end. We suppose\n\u03d5(x) =\ne\u03b1x \u2212 1\n\u03b1\n.\nWe investigate the optimal hedging strategy in a 3-period economy for a trader\nshort one European put option and with zero initial position in the stock and\nzero cash at time 0. We run the above model with parameters p = 0.7, u =\n1\/d = exp(0.1) and r = 1.05. Tables I-III give a comparison of optimal hedging\nstrategies with respect to different liquidity parameters, \u03b1, with differing strikes\nand risk aversion parameters. Notice that \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to a perfectly liquid\nmarket, i.e. \u03d5(x) = x. As seen, the presence of liquidity costs forces the trader\nto trade more cautiously and much less, in absolute quantities, compared to one\nin a liquid market . This behaviour does not change even if the risk aversion\nparameter, \u03b3, changes. The less liquid the market the less the agent trades. For\ninstance, if one increases the liquidity parameter to 0.5, the initial optimal hedge\nbecomes selling 0.04 units of the stock short.\nOn the other hand, one can see that as the liquidity parameter gets smaller, i.e.\n\u03d5(x) \u2192 x, the optimal hedge ratios tends to be closer to the ones in a perfectly\nliquid market. The speed of convergence is not uniform in trading dates and the\ncloser to the maturity the smaller \u03b1 may be needed to converge to the standard\nCRR limit.\nTable IV reports the marginal prices associated with the optimal hedges. Notice\nthat the asset price S admits an equivalent martingale measure. Although the\ntable shows the values with 2 decimal points, the marginal prices corresponding\nto the optimal strategy when \u03b1 = 5e-5, coincide with S up to 3 decimal points\nat all nodes.\nLet C denote the random variable representing a European contingent claim in\nthe binomial model specified above. Define\nvC(x, y) = ess sup E[U(YN+1 \u2212 C)].\nThe reservation ask price, p(x, y), of the claim C is the real number satisfying\nvC(x, y + p) = v(x, y).\n9\n\u03b1 t=0 u d uu ud du dd\n\u2206 0 -0.75 0.15 -0.49 -8.26 -9.26 -8.66 -9.86\n\u2206 5e-5 -0.75 0.11 -0.54 -8.14 -9.14 -8.46 -9.63\n\u2206 5e-2 -0.32 -0.22 -0.30 -0.2 -0.24 -0.20 -0.24\nTable I: K = 1 \u03b3 = 1\n\u03b1 t=0 u d uu ud du dd\n\u2206 0 -0.23 0.12 -0.40 -2.85 -4.01 -3.49 -4.77\n\u2206 5e-2 -0.24 -0.09 -0.33 -0.17 -0.31 -0.16 -0.30\nTable II: K = 1 \u03b3 = 5\n\u03b1 t=0 u d uu ud du dd\n\u2206 0 -0.89 0.25 -0.83 -8.26 -9.3 -8.22 -9.37\n\u2206 5e-2 -0.36 -0.23 -0.34 -0.17 -0.25 -0.19 -0.19\nTable III: K = 1.1. \u03b3 = 1\n\u03b1 t=0 u d uu ud du dd\n\u03d5\u2032(\u2206)S 0 1 1.10 0.90 1.22 1.00 1.00 0.82\n\u03d5\u2032(\u2206)S 5e-5 1 1.10 0.90 1.22 1.00 1.00 0.82\n\u03d5\u2032(\u2206)S 5e-2 0.98 1.09 0.89 1.21 0.99 0.99 0.81\nTable IV: Marginal prices associated with the optimal hedging strategies with\ndifferent liquidity parameters.\nGiven the exponential form of the utility function, one finds\np(x, y) =\n1\n\u03b3\nlog\nvC(x, y)\nv(x, y)\n. (6.14)\nFigures 1 and 2 present the reservation ask prices, as a function of initial hold-\nings of the stock (assuming no initial cash position), of European put options\nwith different strikes, liquidity and risk aversion parameters.

What\nin a liquid market would be arbitrage opportunities can perfectly well exist in\nsuch a model, because the cost of liquidity prevents unbounded exploitation of\nthe apparent arbitrage; an agent will exploit the opportunity until the increasing\ncost of liquidity makes it unprofitable to proceed further. Along the optimal\npath, the marginal price of the stock becomes a martingale in the measure given\nby the marginal utility of optimal terminal wealth.\nWe also investigate the effects of liquidity on the optimal hedging strategy for\na European put option in a binomial model with CARA utility. Even small\nliquidity costs can make a big difference to the extent to which one should hedge,\neven in this simple discrete-time model. A similar analysis in continuous time\nis performed by Rogers & Singh [14], who find comparable results, as well as an\nasymptotic expansion for the cost of liquidity and its effect on hedging.\nA Appendix\nA.1 Proofs of theorems\nDefine for each n, x, and y,\nCn(x, y) = {En[\u03a6n(x, y, (\u2206X))] : (\u2206X) previsible, Xn = x, Yn = y}.\n12\nThus, we can rewrite the optimisation problem of the trader as follows:\nvn(x, y) = ess sup H\u2208Cn(x,y)H. (A.16)\nLemma A.1 Cn(x, y) is a lattice for all n, x, and y.\nProof. If Zi = En[\u03a6n(x, y, (\u2206X\ni))], i = 1, 2, then taking\n(\u2206X) = I{Z1>Z2}(\u2206X1) + I{Z1\u2264Z2}(\u2206X2), we obtain\nEn[\u03a6n(x, y, (\u2206X))] = Z1 \u2228 Z2. \u00a4\nProof of Proposition 2.1. Monotonicity is obvious. For the concavity,\nsuppose we consider (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as two possible starting values at time\nn. Pick p \u2208 (0, 1) and set q = 1\u2212 p.

By Lemma A.1, Cn(x, y) is a lattice. Therefore\nfor each k we can find some (\u2206Xn,k,x,y) such that\nE[Zn,k,x,y)] \u2265 sup{EZ : Z \u2208 Cn(x, y)} \u2212 2\u2212k.\nwhere Zn,k,x,y \u2261 \u03a6(x, y, (\u2206Xn,k,x,y)), and (for fixed n, x, y) the random variables\nZn,k,x,y increase with k. Such choices can be made simultaneously for all (x, y)\nin4 Dk \u00d7 Dk. These strategies are in some sense good if we start with portfolio\n(x, y) at time n. We extend these good portfolio choices to all (x\u2032, y\u2032) by setting\n(\u2206Xn,k,x\n\u2032,y\u2032) = (\u2206Xn,k,x,y) if x \u2264 x\u2032 < x+ 2\u2212k, y \u2264 y\u2032 < y + 2\u2212k,\nwhere (x, y) \u2208 Dk \u00d7 Dk.

If we consider a particular portfolio (x, y) at time n,\nand let (Xm, Ym)n\u2264m\u2264N denote the optimal portfolio process from that time on,\nwe have for any \u03b5 > 0 that\nvn(x+\u03b5, y) \u2265 vn(x, y)+En\n[\nU(YN+1+{\u2212\u03d5(\u2212XN\u2212\u03b5)+\u03d5(\u2212XN)}SN)\u2212U(YN+1)\n]\n,\n(A.19)\nby comparing the optimal outcome from (x+ \u03b5, y) with what would happen if we\nsimply held the \u03b5 units of stock until the end, while following the optimal policy\nfrom (x, y) with the rest of the portfolio.\nRearranging (A.19) gives\nvn(x+ \u03b5, y)\u2212 vn(x, y)\n\u03b5\n\u2265 En\n[\nR1(\u03b5)R2(\u03b5)\n]\n(A.20)\nwhere the two positive random variables R1(\u03b5) and R2(\u03b5) are defined by\nR1(\u03b5) \u2261 SN \u03d5(\u2212XN)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2212XN \u2212 \u03b5)\n\u03b5\nR2(\u03b5) \u2261 U(YN+1 + SN(\u03d5(\u2212XN)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2212XN \u2212 \u03b5)))\u2212 U(YN+1)\nSN(\u03d5(\u2212XN)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2212XN \u2212 \u03b5))\nNotice that as \u03b5 \u2193 0 we have R1(\u03b5) increases (because of convexity of \u03d5) and\nR2(\u03b5) increases (because of concavity of U), leading to the conclusion\nDx+vn(x, y) \u2265 En\n[\nSN\u03d5\n\u2032(\u2212XN)U \u2032(YN+1)\n]\n(A.21)\n15\nwhere Dx+ denotes the right derivative with respect to x. If we now consider\nwhat happens if we perturb (x, y) to (x\u2212 \u03b5, y) we obtain similarly\nvn(x\u2212 \u03b5, y)\u2212 vn(x, y)\n\u03b5\n\u2265 En\n[\nR3(\u03b5)R4(\u03b5)\n]\n(A.22)\nwhere the two positive random variables R3(\u03b5) and R4(\u03b5) are defined by\nR3(\u03b5) \u2261 SN \u03d5(\u2212XN + \u03b5)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2212XN)\n\u03b5\nR4(\u03b5) \u2261 U(YN+1)\u2212 U(YN+1 \u2212 SN(\u03d5(\u2212XN + \u03b5)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2212XN)))\nSN(\u03d5(\u2212XN + \u03b5)\u2212 \u03d5(\u2212XN))\nAs before, these converge monotonically downwards as \u03b5 \u2193 0, by the convexity of\n\u03d5 and concavity of U , leading to the conclusion that\nDx\u2212vn(x, y) \u2264 En\n[\nSN\u03d5\n\u2032(\u2212XN)U \u2032(YN+1)\n]\n(A.23)\nHowever, the concavity of vn guarantees that Dx\u2212vn(x, y) \u2265 Dx+vn(x, y), and\ntogether with (A.21) and (A.23) all that can happen is that\nDx+vn(x, y) = Dx\u2212vn(x, y) = Dxvn(x, y) = En\n[\nSN\u03d5\n\u2032(\u2212XN)U \u2032(YN+1)\n]\n(A.24)\nA similar but simpler argument gives us\nDy+vn(x, y) = Dy\u2212vn(x, y) = Dyvn(x, y) = En\n[\nU \u2032(YN+1)\n]\n(A.25)\nObserve that in view of Assumption A we have for any (x, y) \u2208 Do that U \u2032(YN+1) \u2208\nL1, SN\u03d5\n\u2032(\u2212XN)U \u2032(YN+1) \u2208 L1.\nHowever, we have not finished with these perturbations ideas yet. We analysed\nDxvn(x, y) by considering perturbing x to x + \u03b5, and then using the suboptimal\npolicy of holding the additional \u03b5 units of stock until the end. Alternatively, we\ncould consider the suboptimal policy of immediately converting the extra \u03b5 units\nof stock into cash, and we would obtain (as in (A.19))\nvn(x+\u03b5, y) \u2265 vn(x, y)+En\n[\nU(YN+1\u2212{\u03d5(\u2206Xn+1\u2212\u03b5)\u2212\u03d5(\u2206Xn+1)}Sn)\u2212U(YN+1)\n]\n,\n(A.26)\nCarrying out the analogues of steps (A.20) to (A.24) leads us to the similar but\ndifferent conclusion that\nDxvn(x, y) = Sn\u03d5\n\u2032(\u2206Xn+1)En[U \u2032(YN+1) ], (A.27)\nwhich combines with (A.24) to give\nEn\n[\nU \u2032(YN+1){Sn\u03d5\u2032(\u2206Xn+1)\u2212 SN\u03d5\u2032(\u2212XN)}\n]\n= 0,\n16\nin other words,\nthe process Mn \u2261 \u03d5\u2032(\u2206Xn+1)Sn is a martingale with respect to Q, (A.28)\nwhere Q is the probability measure equivalent to P , with density\ndQ\ndP\n\u221d U \u2032(YN+1)\n\u00a4\nReferences\n[1] P.
