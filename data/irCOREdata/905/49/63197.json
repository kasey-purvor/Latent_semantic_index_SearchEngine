Introduction\nIt has been estimated that over 99.99% of the universe is made up of plasma - the fourth27\nstate of matter, composed of free ions and electrons. Despite its universal importance, our28\nunderstanding of natural plasmas is limited by our ability to observe their behaviour and29\nmeasure their properties. The most accessible natural plasma environment for study is30\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The Earth\u2019s magnetosphere is that region31\nof near-Earth space which is permeated by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The plasma in the32\nmagnetosphere is controlled mainly by magnetic and electric forces that are much stronger33\nhere than gravity or the effect of collisions. The magnetosphere is embedded in the34\noutflowing plasma of the solar corona, known as the solar wind, and its associated magnetic35\nfield, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Because of the high conductivity of the36\nsolar wind and magnetospheric plasmas, their respective magnetic fields are effectively37\n\u201cfrozen-in\u201d to the plasma (like in a superconductor). The frozen-in nature of these two38\nplasmas means that the solar wind cannot easily penetrate the Earth\u2019s magnetic field39\nbut is mostly deflected around it. This results in the distortion of the magnetosphere40\nand the two plasmas end up being separated by a boundary, the magnetopause. The41\nmagnetopause is roughly bullet-shaped and extends to \u223c10-12 Earth radii (RE) on the42\ndayside of the Earth, and stretches out into a long tail, the magnetotail, which extends to43\nhundreds of RE on the nightside of the Earth. However, the two plasma regions are not44\ntotally isolated as the process of magnetic reconnection allows the transmission of solar45\nwind mass, energy, and momentum across the magnetopause, and into the magnetosphere.46\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 5\nMagnetic reconnection (or merging) is a physical process [Priest and Forbes, 2000] which47\ninvolves a change in the connectivity of magnetic field lines (or magnetic flux) that fa-48\ncilitates the transfer of mass, momentum and energy. The resultant splicing together49\nof different magnetic domains changes the overall topology of the magnetic field. If we50\nconsider a magnetic topology with antiparallel magnetic field lines frozen into two adjoin-51\ning plasmas, where the plasma and magnetic field lines on both sides are moving toward52\neach other, this results in a current sheet separating these regions, with a large change53\nin the magnetic field across it. The frozen-in field approximation breaks down in this54\ncurrent sheet allowing magnetic field lines to diffuse across the plasma. This diffusion55\nallows oppositely-directed magnetic fields to annihilate at certain points. This results in56\nX-type configurations of the magnetic field, as shown in the schematic representation of57\na two-dimensional reconnection region in fig.1. Here, the magnetic field strength is zero58\nat the centre of the X, termed the magnetic neutral point. The magnetic field lines form-59\ning the X, and passing through the neutral point, are called the separatrix. Plasma and60\nmagnetic field lines are transported toward the neutral point from either side as shown61\nby the blue arrows in fig.1. Reconnection of the field lines occurs at the neutral point62\nand the merged field lines, populated by a mixture of plasma from both regions, are ex-63\npelled from the neutral point approximately perpendicular to their inflow direction. This64\nprocess of magnetic reconnection is fundamental to the behaviour of the natural plasmas65\nof many astrophysical environments. For example, solar flares, the largest explosion in66\nthe solar system, are caused by the reconnection of large systems of magnetic flux on the67\nSun, releasing in minutes the energy that has been stored in the solar magnetic field over68\na period of weeks to years. Reconnection is also important to the science of controlled69\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 6 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nnuclear fusion as it is one mechanism preventing the magnetic confinement of the fusion70\nfuel.71\nAt the Earth\u2019s magnetopause magnetic reconnection is the major process through which72\nsolar wind mass, energy and momentum are transferred from the solar wind into the73\nmagnetospheric system. Together with reconnection within the magnetotail, this drives a74\nglobal circulation of plasma and magnetic flux within the magnetosphere and ionosphere75\n[Dungey, 1961]. Figure 2 presents a schematic representation of the magnetosphere in76\nthe noon-midnight meridian plane which highlights the topology of the Earth\u2019s magnetic77\nfield and its connection to the IMF. Point N1 marks an example location of a reconnection78\nneutral point on the dayside magnetopause, with an IMF field line (marked 1) reconnecting79\nwith a geomagnetic field line (marked 1\u2032). Typically, the connectivity of geomagnetic field80\nlines is of two types: Open - one end of the magnetic field line is connected to the Earth,81\nthe other to the IMF. Closed - both ends are connected to the Earth. Geomagnetic field82\nline 1\u2032 represents the last closed field line in the dayside magnetosphere. As a result of83\nthe magnetopause reconnection two open field lines are created (marked 2 and 2\u2032) which84\nare dragged by the solar wind flow to the nightside of the magnetosphere and into the85\nmagnetotail (to points 3 and 3\u2032). Here, the existence of the anti-parallel magnetic field86\nconfiguration results in magnetotail reconnection (at neutral point N2 in fig.2). In three87\ndimensions, the reconnection X-points depicted as N1 and N2 in fig.2 are thought to88\nextend along the magnetopause and magnetotail current sheets in lines known as X-lines.89\nFigure 3 presents a 3-dimensional schematic representation of the magnetosphere which90\nhighlights these extended X-lines.91\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 7\nAccurate measurement of both the magnetopause and magnetotail reconnection rates,92\nand an understanding of the factors that influence them has been a major scientific goal93\nfor many years. The reconnection rate (or equivalently the reconnection electric field)94\nis defined as the rate of transfer of magnetic flux across unit length of the separatrix95\nbetween the unreconnected and reconnected field lines. In the magnetospheric environ-96\nment, important outstanding questions concerning reconnection, which can be addressed97\nby reconnection rate measurements, include: Where is the typical location, and what is98\nthe typical extent (in both time and space), of both the magnetopause and magneto-99\ntail X-lines? How does the reconnection rate vary along these X-lines, and with time?100\nHow do these things change with changing interplanetary magnetic field and geomagnetic101\nconditions?102\nThe reconnection rate can be measured by spacecraft in the reconnecting current sheet,103\nlocal to the neutral points, by measuring the electric field tangential to the reconnection X-104\nline [Sonnerup et al., 1981; Lindqvist and Mozer, 1990]. Such studies have shown evidence105\nfor a fast reconnection rate (inflow speed \/ Alfve\u00b4n speed \u223c 0.1) [Priest and Forbes, 2000].106\nHowever, it is generally difficult to measure the reconnection rate with satellites because107\nit must be measured in the frame of reference of the separatrix, which is often in motion.108\nHence, such measurements are typically sparse in space and time, limited to the location109\nand time of each spacecraft crossing of the current sheet.110\nMore continuous and extensive measurements of reconnection in time and space can111\npresently be achieved only by remotely sensing magnetic reconnection in the magneto-112\nsphere from the ionosphere. The ionosphere, located at altitudes of \u223c80-2000 km, forms113\nthe base of the magnetospheric plasma environment. It is the transition region from the114\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 8 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nfully-ionized magnetospheric plasma to the neutral atmosphere of the Earth. As can be115\nseen in fig.3, the focussing effect of the Earth\u2019s dipole-like magnetic field projects recon-116\nnection signatures from the vast volume of the magnetosphere onto the relatively small117\narea of the polar ionospheres, where they can be measured by ground- and space-based118\ninstruments. Hence, the ionospheric perspective is immensely valuable as a window to119\nthe huge outer magnetosphere and the reconnection processes occurring there.120\nIn simple quasi-steady-state reconnection scenarios for different IMF orientations121\n[Dungey, 1961, 1963; Russell, 1972; Cowley, 1981], and in the absence of other (e.g.,122\nviscous) transport processes [Axford and Hines, 1961], the total globally-integrated re-123\nconnection rate is equal to the maximum electric potential difference across the polar124\nionosphere. This can be measured every \u223c100 min by low-altitude polar-orbiting satel-125\nlites [Reiff et al., 1981] or at higher cadence by ground-based radar and magnetometer126\nnetworks [Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998; Richmond and Kamide, 1988]. Such studies have127\ninvestigated the functional dependence of the integrated reconnection rate on the relative128\norientation of the reconnecting magnetic fields [Reiff et al., 1981; Freeman et al., 1993].129\nMore generally, imbalance of the integrated reconnection rates at the magnetopause130\nand in the magnetotail results in a change in the relative proportions of open and closed131\nmagnetic flux [Siscoe and Huang, 1985; Cowley and Lockwood, 1992]. Thus, for unbalanced132\nreconnection, the difference in the two integrated reconnection rates can be measured from133\nthe rate of change of polar cap area (the area of incompressible open magnetic flux that134\nthreads the polar ionospheres). Estimates of both the magnetopause and magnetotail135\nreconnection rates can then be made whenever one or the other reconnection rate can136\nbe estimated [Lewis et al., 1998], or is negligible [Milan et al., 2003], or by summing the137\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 9\ndifference measurement with an estimate of the average of the two reconnection rates given138\nby the cross-polar cap potential [Cowley and Lockwood, 1992]. Such studies have revealed139\nand quantified the variation of global magnetopause and magnetotail reconnection through140\nthe substorm cycle [Milan et al., 2007].141\nOn shorter time scales, local reconnection rates have been inferred from low-altitude142\nspacecraft observations of the dispersion of ions from the reconnection site precipitating143\ninto the ionosphere on newly-opened magnetic field lines [Lockwood and Smith, 1992].144\nThese observations provide a temporal profile of the reconnection rate at a single location145\nfor the duration of the satellite pass (\u223c10 min). Such studies show the reconnection rate146\nto vary on timescales of minutes, as suggested by the in-situ observation of flux transfer147\nevents (instances of transient reconnection) at the magnetopause [Russell and Elphic,148\n1978].149\nMost generally, the reconnection rate is measured from the ionosphere by first detect-150\ning the ionospheric projections of regions of different magnetic connectivity (e.g., open151\nand closed magnetospheric field lines) and then measuring the transport of magnetic flux152\nbetween them. The reconnection rate equates to the component of the ionospheric convec-153\ntion electric field tangential to the ionospheric projection of the reconnection separatrix,154\nin the frame of the reconnection separatrix. Hence, in a ground-based measurement frame,155\ncontributions can arise from (1) plasma convecting across the separatrix, and (2) move-156\nment of the separatrix in the measurement frame. As shown schematically in fig.3, the157\nreconnection separatrix (yellow and green shaded areas) maps down magnetic field lines158\nfrom the in-situ reconnection X-lines (bold blue lines in space) to regions in the polar iono-159\nspheres termed \u201cmerging lines\u201d (bold blue lines in the ionosphere). The different magnetic160\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 10 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nfield topologies in the two regions either side of the separatrix give rise to different plasma161\nproperties in each region, which can be detected at the ionospheric footprints. During162\nsouthward IMF conditions, when magnetopause reconnection occurs preferentially on the163\nlow-latitude magnetopause (as in figs.2 and 3), the dayside merging line is co-located164\nwith the ionospheric projection of the open-closed magnetic field line boundary (OCB),165\nalternatively termed the polar cap boundary. During strong northward IMF conditions,166\nwhen reconnection occurs at high latitudes on the magnetotail lobe magnetopause, the167\nreconnection separatrix is typically located some distance poleward of the OCB, within168\nthe polar cap, at the point where the lobe magnetopause maps into the ionosphere. On169\nthe nightside of the Earth the merging line associated with the most-distant magnetotail170\nX-line is always co-located with the OCB. Reconnection is also thought to occur Earth-171\nward of this far-tail X-line (at a near-Earth neutral line) but there is not as yet a clear172\nsignature of the ionospheric projection of this X-line.173\nThe first reconnection rate measurements of this type were made in the nightside iono-174\nsphere by de la Beaujardie`re et al. [1991] using Sondrestrom Incoherent Scatter Radar175\n(ISR) measurements. Using a single meridional radar beam they measured the plasma176\nvelocity across the OCB in the OCB rest frame. The location of the OCB was estimated177\nby identifying strong electron density gradients which occur at ionospheric E-region al-178\ntitudes along the poleward boundary of the auroral oval. These are thought to be a179\ngood proxy for the OCB in the nightside ionosphere. Blanchard et al. [1996, 1997] later180\nrefined these measurements by locating the OCB using both E-region electron density181\nmeasurements and 630 nm auroral emissions measured by ground-based optical instru-182\nments. They investigated how the magnetotail reconnection rate varied with magnetic183\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 11\nlocal time, with variations in the IMF, and with substorm activity. Since then, a number184\nof studies have used single radar beams to make single-point reconnection rate measure-185\nments of this type in both the dayside and nightside ionospheres [Pinnock et al., 1999;186\nBlanchard et al., 2001; \u00d8stgaard et al., 2005]. These studies have used a range of different187\ntechniques to determine the OCB location and motion. However, the employment of a188\nsingle meridional radar beam in the above studies meant that no investigation could be189\nmade of spatial variations in the reconnection rate.190\nBaker et al. [1997] first measured the reconnection rate across an extended longitudinal191\nregion. They used the technique of L-shell fitting [Ruohoniemi et al., 1989] to estimate192\ntwo-dimensional ionospheric convection velocity vectors from line-of-sight velocity mea-193\nsurements made by a single radar of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)194\n[Greenwald et al., 1995; Chisham et al., 2007]. They also used variations in the Doppler195\nspectral width characteristics measured by the radar to estimate the OCB location. Since196\nthen, the advent of large networks of ionospheric radars which can measure the plasma197\nconvection velocity over large regions of the ionosphere has made extensive measurements198\nof the reconnection rate a reality. Recent studies [Pinnock et al., 2003; Milan et al.,199\n2003; Chisham et al., 2004b; Hubert et al., 2006; Imber et al., 2006] have employed the200\ntechnique of SuperDARN global convection mapping to measure the convection velocity201\nacross large regions of the polar ionospheres for a range of IMF conditions. Combined with202\nmeasurements of the location and motion of the ionospheric footprint of the reconnection203\nseparatrix from a range of different instrumentation, these studies have illustrated that204\nthe magnetopause reconnection rate not only varies with time but also with longitudinal205\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 12 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nlocation along the merging line. The magnetotail reconnection rate has also been studied206\nin a similar way [Lam et al., 2006; Hubert et al., 2006].207\nThe purpose of this paper is to build on these previous studies and to present a standard208\nmethodology for reconnection rate determination which can be easily implemented. To209\nthis end we:210\n(1) Set out in full a complete methodology for remote sensing of the reconnection rate.211\n(2) Review the techniques for determining the ionospheric convection velocity field and212\nthe ionospheric projection of the reconnection separatrix.213\n(3) Highlight and discuss problems and uncertainties concerning the methodology and214\ntechniques.215\n(4) Present an example of a global application of this methodology.216\n2. Methodology for estimating the reconnection rate\nIn this section we outline mathematically the methodology for determining reconnection217\nrates using ionospheric measurements. We also review the instrumentation and analysis218\ntechniques used to make these ionospheric measurements. The application of many of219\nthese techniques is described by considering a 2-hour interval of data from 26 December220\n2000. The results of the reconnection rate analysis using the combined data sets from this221\ninterval are presented in section 3.222\n2.1. Theory\n2.1.1. General formulation223\nThe principle of remote measurement of the reconnection electric field was first pre-224\nsented by Vasyliunas [1984] who argued that the potential variation along the ionospheric225\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 13\nprojection of the reconnection separatrix (the merging line) related directly to that along226\nthe in-situ reconnection X-line. The reconnection electric field in the ionosphere equates227\nto the component of the ionospheric convection electric field that is directed tangential to228\nthe ionospheric projection of the reconnection separatrix, in the frame of the separatrix.229\nThis equates to the rate of flux transfer across the reconnection separatrix, assuming that230\nthe magnetic field is frozen in to the plasma. It is assumed that the plasma flow in the231\npolar ionosphere is dominated by the convection electric field and that the convection232\nvelocity field is divergence-free.233\nThe reconnection rate, or electric field (Erec), in the ionosphere at any point s along234\nthe reconnection separatrix at a time t can be written235\nErec(s, t) = E\n\u2032(s, t) \u00b7 T\u02c6(s, t) (1)236\nwhere E\u2032(s, t) is the convection electric field at the separatrix, in the frame of the separa-237\ntrix, and238\nT\u02c6(s, t) =\ndP(s, t)\nds\n(2)239\nrepresents the tangent to the separatrix, where P(s, t) describes the location of the sepa-240\nratrix.241\nWe can relate the convection electric field to the ionospheric convection velocity field if242\nwe assume the ideal magnetohydrodynamic approximation of Ohm\u2019s law243\nE\u2032(s, t) = \u2212(V\u2032(s, t)\u00d7B(s)) (3)244\nwhere V\u2032(s, t) is the convection velocity at locations along the separatrix, in the frame of245\nthe separatrix (a one-dimensional path through the convection velocity field V\u2032(x, t)), and246\nB(s) = Bz(s)z\u02c6 is the magnetic field (approximated as being vertical and time invariant).247\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 14 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nThe normal to the separatrix at a fixed ionospheric height can be written as,248\nN\u02c6(s, t) = \u2212(z\u02c6\u00d7 T\u02c6(s, t)) (4)249\nand hence, combining (1), (3), and (4), the reconnection electric field, (1), can be rewritten250\nas,251\nErec(s, t) = Bz(s)\n(\nV\u2032(s, t) \u00b7 N\u02c6(s, t)\n)\n(5)252\nThe ionospheric convection velocity is not typically measured in the frame of the sep-253\naratrix and hence we need to convert convection velocity measurements V(s, t) into this254\nframe using the transformation,255\nV\u2032(s, t) = V(s, t)\u2212 dP(s, t)\ndt\n(6)256\nBy combining (5) and (6) we can write the reconnection electric field as,257\nErec(s, t) = Bz(s)\n[(\nV(s, t)\u2212 dP(s, t)\ndt\n)\n\u00b7 N\u02c6(s, t)\n]\n(7)258\nThe total rate of flux transfer (dF12(t)\/dt) along a merging line connecting points P1259\nand P2 is given by the integrated reconnection rate, or reconnection voltage (\u03c612(t)), which260\nis determined by integrating the reconnection electric field along this merging line.261\n\u03c612(t) =\ndF12(t)\ndt\n262\n=\n\u222b P2\nP1\nErec(s, t) ds263\n=\n\u222b P2\nP1\nBz(s)\n[(\nV(s, t)\u2212 dP(s, t)\ndt\n)\n\u00b7 N\u02c6(s, t)\n]\nds (8)264\nTypically, reconnection at the magnetopause increases open magnetic flux whereas265\nreconnection in the magnetotail decreases open flux. Consequently the total globally-266\nintegrated reconnection rate in the magnetospheric system is given by the rate of change267\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 15\nof open magnetic flux in the polar cap268\ndFpc\ndt\n= Bi\ndApc\ndt\n= \u03c6d + \u03c6n (9)269\nwhere \u03c6d and \u03c6n are the total reconnection voltages along the magnetopause and magne-270\ntotail X-lines, respectively, and Apc is the area of open flux in the ionosphere. Measuring271\nthe reconnection rate from the ionosphere offers the advantages that Apc is minimized272\nand Bi is approximately constant and hence can be described by a static empirical model.273\nThus, by measuring changes in polar cap area, the measurement of either of the magne-274\ntopause or magnetotail reconnection voltages allows estimation of the other [Milan et al.,275\n2003].276\n2.1.2. Discrete formulation277\nActual measurements of the convection velocity (V) and the reconnection separatrix278\nposition in the ionosphere (P) typically comprise sparse discrete observations, rather than279\ncontinuous functions. Consequently, for practical purposes we rewrite (7) in a discrete280\nform as,281\nEreci(t) = Bzi\n[\n(Vi(t)\u2212VPi(t)) \u00b7 N\u02c6i(t)\n]\n(10)282\nwhere subscript i refers to a discrete velocity vector measurement and where the motion283\nof the separatrix has been simplified as VPi (the meridional component of the separatrix284\nvelocity at the location of velocity vector i). For ease of calculation we rewrite this as,285\nEreci(t) = Bzi [|Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t)\u2212 |VPi(t)| cos\u03b1i(t)] (11)286\nwhere \u03b8i is the angle between the velocity vector and the normal to the separatrix and \u03b1i287\nis the angle between the meridional direction and the normal to the separatrix. Hence,288\nestimates of the reconnection rate require measurements of the vertical magnetic field289\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 16 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nstrength, the separatrix location and motion, and the convection velocity. The magnetic290\nfield strength varies little in the incompressible ionosphere and so values from the Altitude-291\nAdjusted Corrected Geomagnetic (AACGM) field model [Baker and Wing, 1989] can be292\nassumed. The AACGM model is also used as the geomagnetic coordinate system in this293\nanalysis.294\nGenerally, our discrete measured velocity vectors will not be co-located with the mea-295\nsured separatrix location. Hence, we consider velocity vectors close to the separatrix to296\nbe the best estimate of the velocity field at the separatrix. Typically, those within half297\nthe latitudinal resolution of the velocity measurements are most suitable. Fig.4 presents298\na basic schematic representation of the scenario at each discrete measurement point i.299\nFigure 4a presents an example scenario of the actual measured quantities. We have suit-300\nable velocity vectors Vi = V(\u03bbi, \u03c6i) at N discrete locations with AACGM latitude \u03bbi301\nand AACGM longitude \u03c6i (i = 1...N) and separatrix identifications Pj = P(\u03bbj, \u03c6j) at302\nM discrete positions with AACGM latitude \u03bbj and AACGM longitude \u03c6j (j = 1...M).303\nFigure 4b shows the derived quantities that are used as input to equation (11) for the304\nsame example as in fig.4a. For each velocity vector we assume that the measured velocity305\nis a good approximation for the velocity at the separatrix at the same AACGM longitude.306\nPi is an estimate of the separatrix position at AACGM longitude \u03c6i, the latitude of which307\ncan be approximated by the linear interpolation of neighbouring separatrix measurements308\n(\u03bbj1, \u03c6j1) and (\u03bbj2, \u03c6j2),309\n\u03bb(Pi) = \u03bbj1 +\n(\n\u03bbj2 \u2212 \u03bbj1\n\u03c6j2 \u2212 \u03c6j1\n)\n(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j1) (12)310\nIf the discrete separatrix points are not too far apart then we can assume a locally linear311\napproximation. Therefore, the angle \u03b1i = \u03b1(Pi) between the normal to the separatrix312\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 17\nand the meridional direction can be given as,313\n\u03b1i = tan\n\u22121\n[\n\u03bbj2 \u2212 \u03bbj1\n(\u03c6j2 \u2212 \u03c6j1) cos\u03bbj2\n]\n. (13)314\nAlternatively, \u03bb(Pi) and \u03b1i can be estimated by a higher order method (see section 2.3.6).315\nThe angle between the velocity vector Vi and the meridian direction is given by \u03b8Vi =316\n\u03b8V(\u03bbi, \u03c6i). Hence, the angle between the velocity vector and the normal to the separatrix317\nis given by,318\n\u03b8i = \u03b8Vi \u2212 \u03b1i (14)319\nWe assume for simplicity that the separatrix motion in the ionosphere is purely latitu-320\ndinal and hence the magnitude of the separatrix velocity at AACGM longitude \u03c6i is given321\nby,322\n|VPi(t)| =\n(RE + h) [\u03bb(Pi(t))\u2212 \u03bb(Pi(t\u2212\u0394t))]\n\u0394t\n(15)323\nwhere RE is the radius of the Earth, h is the altitude of the observations, and \u0394t is the324\ntime between successive separatrix estimates.325\nEntering single point measurements into (11) allows us to make localised estimates of326\nthe reconnection electric field [Pinnock et al., 1999; Blanchard et al., 2001]. However, if we327\nwish to determine the spatiotemporal structure of the electric field or make an estimate of328\nthe reconnection voltage along a merging line, we need to make as many measurements as329\npossible along the merging line. If we assume Nvec discrete velocity vector measurements330\nalong a merging line, the total rate of flux transfer, or reconnection voltage, for that331\nmerging line can be estimated from,332\n\u03c6rec(t) =\nNvec\u2211\ni=1\nEreci(t)\u0394si(t) (16)333\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 18 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nwhere \u0394si(t) represents the length of the separatrix portion at measurement location i,334\nwhich for closely-spaced measurements can be approximated by,335\n\u0394si(t) \u2248\n( |Pi+1(t)\u2212Pi\u22121(t)|\n2\n)\n(17)336\n2.1.3. Error analysis337\nIn order to gain a quantitative feel for reconnection rate estimates we need to have an338\nappreciation of the uncertainties in the measured quantities. We can estimate the uncer-339\ntainty, or error, in a single measurement of the reconnection electric field at measurement340\npoint i as,341\n\u03b5\u3008Ereci(t)\u3009 \u2248 Bzi\n(\n\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t)\u30092 + \u03b5\u3008|VPi(t)| cos\u03b1i(t)\u30092\n) 1\n2 (18)342\nwhere \u03b5\u3008x\u3009 represents the uncertainty in the measurement of parameter x. (This rep-343\nresentation assumes that the uncertainty in the magnetic field (\u03b5\u3008Bzi\u3009) is negligible.)344\nThis uncertainty should only be viewed as an estimate as strictly the formulation re-345\nquires that |Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t) and |VPi(t)| cos\u03b1i(t) are independent and uncorrelated. This346\nis not strictly true since both have some dependence on the normal to the separatrix347\n(N\u02c6i(t)). From (18), the uncertainty in Ereci(t) is dependent on: (1) \u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t)\u3009,348\nthe uncertainty in the convection velocity measurement, and (2) \u03b5\u3008|VPi(t)| cos\u03b1i(t)\u3009, the349\nuncertainty in the measurement of the separatrix motion.350\nThe uncertainty in the convection velocity measurement can be approximated as,351\n\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t)\u3009 \u2248\n(\ncos2 \u03b8i(t)\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)|\u30092 + |Vi(t)|2 sin2 \u03b8i(t)\u03b5\u3008\u03b8i(t)\u30092\n) 1\n2 (19)352\nwhich again assumes that the uncertainties in |Vi(t)| and \u03b8i(t) are independent and un-353\ncorrelated. The uncertainties in the velocity magnitude (\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)|\u3009) and in the angle that354\nthe velocity vector makes with the separatrix normal (\u03b5\u3008\u03b8i(t)\u3009) are inherently difficult to355\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 19\nestimate and depend largely on the technique being employed to determine the convection356\nvelocity. However, it is possible to simplify our uncertainty estimates to allow a rough357\nestimate of the level of uncertainty. If we assume that the uncertainty in the velocity358\nmagnitude is proportional to the magnitude (\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)|\u3009 = a1|Vi(t)|, where a1 is a con-359\nstant), and that the uncertainty in the angle can be given by \u03b5\u3008\u03b8i(t)\u3009 = a2 (where a2 is in360\nradians), then the uncertainty in the convection velocity measurement can be rewritten361\nas,362\n\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t)\u3009 \u2248 |Vi(t)|\n[\na21 cos\n2 \u03b8i(t) + a\n2\n2 sin\n2 \u03b8i(t)\n] 1\n2 . (20)363\nTo illustrate the range of possible uncertainties we consider the limits of equation (20): If364\n\u03b8i(t) = 0\n\u25e6 (the velocity vector is perpendicular to the separatrix), equation (20) reduces365\nto,366\n\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t)\u3009 \u2248 a1|Vi(t)| (21)367\nwhich implies that the uncertainty relates solely to the uncertainty in the velocity vector368\nmagnitude. If \u03b8i(t) = 90\n\u25e6 (the velocity vector is parallel to the separatrix), this reduces369\nto,370\n\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t)\u3009 \u2248 a2|Vi(t)| (22)371\nwhich implies that the uncertainty relates solely to the uncertainty in the direction of the372\nvelocity vector.373\nThe uncertainty in the separatrix motion at a measurement point, i, can be given by,374\n\u03b5\u3008|VPi(t)| cos\u03b1i(t)\u3009 \u2248\n(\ncos2 \u03b1i(t)\u03b5\u3008|VPi(t)|\u30092 + |VPi(t)|2 sin2 \u03b1i(t)\u03b5\u3008\u03b1i(t)\u30092\n) 1\n2 (23)375\nHence, this uncertainty can be written in terms of the uncertainty in the difference in376\nthe temporal separatrix positions, and the uncertainty in the angle that the separatrix377\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 20 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nnormal makes with the meridional direction. If we make the assumption that both \u03b1i(t)378\nand \u03b5\u3008\u03b1i(t)\u3009 are likely to be small (i.e., the separatrix normal will be aligned close to the379\nthe meridional direction and is likely to be well defined), then we can simplify (23) to,380\n\u03b5\u3008|VPi(t)| cos\u03b1i(t)\u3009 \u2248 \u03b5\u3008|VPi(t)|\u3009 =\n1\n\u0394t\n(RE + h)\u03b5\u3008\u03bb(Pi(t))\u2212 \u03bb(Pi(t\u2212\u0394t))\u3009 (24)381\nHence, the uncertainty depends heavily on \u0394t. As the temporal resolution of the mea-382\nsurements increases (\u0394t decreases) the uncertainty in the separatrix motion will increase.383\nHence, increasing the time resolution of measurements requires an increase in the accuracy384\nof the separatrix measurements to keep the level of uncertainty low. The uncertainty in385\nthe difference in the separatrix positions is heavily dependent on the spatial resolution of386\nthe measurement technique.387\n2.2. Measuring the ionospheric convection velocity field\nA complete picture of the reconnection scenario requires continuous and extensive mea-388\nsurement of the ionospheric convection velocity in space and time. At present, there are389\ntwo techniques in regular use which can provide such a picture of the convection velocity390\nfield across the complete polar ionosphere.391\n(1) The Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) technique.392\nAMIE is an inversion technique used to derive the mathematical fields of physical variables393\nfor the global ionosphere at a given time from spatially irregular measurements of these394\nvariables or related quantities [Richmond and Kamide, 1988]. The field variables are the395\nelectrostatic potential, electric field, height-integrated current density and conductivity,396\nand field-aligned current density at a given height. Measurements are made by magne-397\ntometers on the ground and on low-altitude satellites, ground-based radars, plasma drift398\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 21\nand particle detectors on low-altitude satellites, and optical instruments on the ground399\nand on satellites.400\n(2) The SuperDARN Global Convection Mapping (or Map Potential) technique. Super-401\nDARN global convection maps are produced by fitting line-of-sight velocity information402\nmeasured by the SuperDARN radars to an expansion of an electrostatic potential function403\nexpressed in terms of spherical harmonics [Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998]. This method404\nuses all of the available line-of-sight velocity data from the SuperDARN HF radar network.405\nIt can also accept ion drift velocity data from low-altitude spacecraft as input.406\nLu et al. [2001] showed that convection maps derived using the AMIE and SuperDARN407\nglobal convection mapping techniques, using the same radar data as input, were nearly408\nidentical over areas of extensive radar coverage. However, significant differences arose409\nwhere data were sparse or absent because different statistical models were used by each410\ntechnique to constrain the global solution in these regions. Furthermore, they derived411\nAMIE convection maps using SuperDARN radar data and magnetometer data separately,412\nthe coverage of which was concentrated in different regions. These also showed significant413\ndifferences in regions where data were sparse or absent in one or other data set and values414\nof the cross-polar cap potential that differed by \u223c65%. We are aware of only two studies in415\nwhich the AMIE technique has been used to identify the reconnection separatrix [Taylor416\net al., 1996] and the flow across it [Lu et al., 1995] whereas SuperDARN global convection417\nmapping has regularly been used for these purposes [Pinnock et al., 2003; Milan et al.,418\n2003; Chisham et al., 2004b; Hubert et al., 2006].419\nFor the event study in this paper we use the SuperDARN global convection mapping420\ntechnique to provide our estimate of the ionospheric convection velocity field, because it is421\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 22 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nspecifically designed to measure the convection electric field. Full details of the technique422\n(and the data-preprocessing it requires) can be found in Ruohoniemi and Baker [1998],423\nShepherd and Ruohoniemi [2000], Chisham and Pinnock [2002], and Chisham et al. [2002].424\nThe technique provides an estimate of the convection potential (\u03a6(\u03bb, \u03c6)) and electric field425\n(E = \u2212\u2207\u03a6(\u03bb, \u03c6)) across the whole polar ionosphere in the Earth\u2019s rest frame and can426\nbe used to study large-scale characteristics (e.g., the cross-polar cap potential [Shepherd427\nand Ruohoniemi, 2000]) or mesoscale features (e.g., flow vortices, convection reversal428\nboundaries [Huang et al., 2000]). The scale of resolvable structure is limited by the order429\nof the spherical harmonic fit and the grid cell size of the radar measurements. In practice,430\nthe technique is generally not suitable for small-scale structure (<\u223c 100 km - the basic grid431\ncell size). The analytical solution for the convection electric field can be used to determine432\nthe reconnection rate at all points on the merging lines [Milan et al., 2003; Hubert et al.,433\n2006]. However, the accuracy of these estimates is likely to be poor in regions with no434\nSuperDARN data. We recommend that reconnection rates are only determined in regions435\nwhere SuperDARN data have contributed to the global convection electric field solution.436\nWhereas a solution is provided for the convection electric field across the whole polar437\nionosphere, velocity vectors are only determined in regions where SuperDARN backscatter438\nhave contributed to the fitting process. At these locations, the global convection mapping439\ntechnique provides two alternative methods for determining velocity vectors, which have440\nbeen termed \u2018fit\u2019 and \u2018true\u2019 vectors.441\n\u2018Fit\u2019 velocity vectors represent the E\u00d7B drift velocities of the convection electric field442\nsolution at each grid cell (\u03bbi, \u03c6i) which contributed line-of-sight velocity information to443\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 23\nthe mapping process and are hence given by444\nVfit(\u03bbi, \u03c6i) =\n\u2212\u2207\u03a6(\u03bbi, \u03c6i)\u00d7B(\u03bbi, \u03c6i)\n|B(\u03bbi, \u03c6i)|2 .

However, the fit vector is often inconsistent with the447\ncorresponding line-of-sight velocity measured by radar r in that grid cell (Vlos(\u03bbi, \u03c6i, r)),448\nas the fit vector is determined by the global solution and not solely the local observations.449\nThe correlation between the two becomes better as the order of the spherical harmonic450\nfit is increased and more of the mesoscale variations in the velocity measurements can be451\nfitted to.452\n\u2018True\u2019 velocity vectors represent a combination of the line-of-sight velocity measured at453\neach grid cell with the component of the fit velocity vector which is perpendicular to the454\nline-of-sight direction and are hence given by455\nVtrue(\u03bbi, \u03c6i, r) = |Vfit(\u03bbi, \u03c6i)\u00d7 V\u02c6los(\u03bbi, \u03c6i, r)|\n(\nV\u02c6los(\u03bbi, \u03c6i, r)\u00d7 z\u02c6\n)\n+Vlos(\u03bbi, \u03c6i, r)(26)456\nThe true vectors typically provide a better mesoscale representation of the ionospheric457\nconvection flows [Chisham et al., 2002; Provan et al., 2002]. For this reason, some pre-458\nvious studies which have used SuperDARN global convection mapping to determine the459\nreconnection electric field [Pinnock et al., 2003; Chisham et al., 2004b] have used true460\nvectors, and we will do so here. However, the true vector velocity field is not guaranteed461\nto be divergence free and there is also the possibility of an ambiguity in the true vector462\nmagnitude and direction if a grid cell contains line-of-sight velocity information from more463\nthan one SuperDARN radar. As the goodness of the spherical harmonic fit increases, the464\ntrue vectors become increasingly closer to agreement with the fit vectors.465\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 24 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nFigure 5 presents the northern hemisphere convection map for a 1-minute interval (2017\u2013466\n2018 UT) on 26 December 2000 determined using the SuperDARN global convection467\nmapping technique. The velocity vectors are true vectors, with a length proportional468\nto the velocity magnitude. The equipotential contours of the solution (\u03a6(\u03bb, \u03c6)) which469\nresults from the spherical harmonic fitting are shown by the dashed (morning convection470\ncell) and dotted (afternoon convection cell) contour lines. The spatial coverage of the471\nvectors highlights the region of the convection map where actual SuperDARN data exist.472\nThe equipotential contours in regions where no data exist are heavily influenced by data473\nfrom the statistical model of Ruohoniemi and Greenwald [1996] and hence only provide a474\nstatistical estimate of the true convection in these regions. However, the model does serve475\nto constrain the spherical harmonic fit to provide a realistic estimate of convection at the476\nboundaries of the measured data set. In the example event studied in this paper we only477\nestimate reconnection rates in regions where we have measured true velocity vectors.478\nThe SuperDARN global convection mapping technique often provides an extensive rep-479\nresentation of the convection electric field as shown in figure 5. However, uncertainties in480\nthe magnitude and direction of the velocity vectors are not readily expressed. There are481\na number of aspects of the technique which introduce uncertainty into the output (aside482\nfrom the uncertainties in the input line-of-sight velocity values), as discussed below:483\n(1) Before processing the data for a particular interval, the line-of-sight velocities are484\ngenerally median filtered, both spatially (across a \u223c100 km square grid cell) and tempo-485\nrally (across three successive radar scans - \u223c3-6 min) to increase the statistical significance486\nof the output. Hence, localized or short bursts of strong flow on these scales can be par-487\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 25\ntially averaged away. This will ultimately lead to some smoothing of the spatial and488\ntemporal reconnection rate variations.489\n(2) The least-squares fitting is dependent on two user-selected parameters; (i) the order490\nof the spherical harmonic fit, and (ii) the spatial region over which the fit is performed491\n(primarily the low-latitude boundary of ionospheric convection). Variations in these fit492\nparameters lead to differences in the final solution [Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998; Shepherd493\nand Ruohoniemi, 2000]. Higher order fits produce convection maps that better match the494\nline-of-sight velocity input, but which have lower statistical significance.495\n(3) Pre-inspection of the data can be important if the determination of mesoscale fea-496\ntures of convection is required. Care must be taken to ensure that all the backscatter being497\nused in the convection mapping process has arisen from F-region irregularities moving un-498\nder the influence of the convection electric field. Presently, some ground and E-region499\nbackscatter typically remain after default preprocessing of the SuperDARN data. This500\ncan increase the uncertainties in the reconnection rate calculations. These uncertainties501\ncan be reduced by careful inspection of the line-of-sight velocity data and by filtering502\nthe data in range gate-velocity space to remove non-F -region data before applying the503\nmapping technique [Chisham and Pinnock, 2002] .504\n2.3. Identifying the location and motion of the reconnection separatrix\nThe ionospheric footprint of the reconnection separatrix (the merging line) is usually505\ndetermined using well-established proxies. The reliability of these proxies is variable and is506\naffected by IMF variations, geomagnetic conditions, and spatial location in the ionosphere.507\nDuring intervals when reconnection is occurring on the lobe magnetopause, i.e., when the508\nIMF is close to being northward directed (IMF Bz > 0; By \u223c 0), the dayside merging line509\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 26 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\ntypically lies some distance poleward of the OCB, within the polar cap. In this paper we510\nonly consider intervals where reconnection is occurring on regions of the magnetopause511\nsunward of the magnetospheric cusps (i.e., when the IMF is not strongly northward), and512\nhence when the dayside merging line is co-located with the OCB [Cowley and Lockwood,513\n1992]. In the nightside ionosphere the reconnection separatrix for far-tail reconnection is514\nalways co-located with the OCB. Hence, for most conditions and locations we are trying515\nto measure proxies for the OCB. The methodology presented here is still applicable to the516\nestimation of reconnection rates away from the OCB (such as at the ionospheric footprint517\nof lobe reconnection during northward IMF conditions [Chisham et al., 2004b], or at the518\nionospheric footprint of the near-Earth neutral line in the tail), but the identification of519\nthe reconnection separatrix in these cases is less established, as will be discussed in section520\n4.521\n2.3.1. Particle precipitation boundaries522\nThe high-latitude ionosphere, through its magnetic connection to the outer magneto-523\nsphere, provides an image of magnetospheric regions and boundaries and the physical524\nprocesses occurring there. From numerous observations made by the DMSP low-altitude525\nsatellites, the energy spectra of precipitating ions and electrons have been categorised526\ninto different types. These types correspond to different plasma regions in the Earth\u2019s527\nmagnetosphere whose ionospheric footprints can consequently be identified in an objec-528\ntive way [Newell et al., 1991; Newell and Meng, 1992; Newell et al., 1996]. Some plasma529\nregions are typically located on open magnetic field lines and others on closed [Sotirelis530\nand Newell, 2000] and hence, one can use these low-altitude measurements to identify531\nthe OCB location. In the dayside ionosphere, the OCB is best identified by a transi-532\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 27\ntion between the precipitation regions typically thought to be associated with open (i.e.,533\ncusp, mantle, polar rain) and closed (i.e., central plasma sheet, boundary plasma sheet,534\nlow-latitude boundary layer) field lines [Newell et al., 1991]. In the nightside ionosphere,535\nthe best OCB proxy is the b6 precipitation boundary [Newell et al., 1996] which marks536\nthe poleward edge of the sub-visual drizzle region. As discussed earlier, there are times537\nwhen the OCB is not co-located with the separatrix. In these cases the magnetopause538\nreconnection separatrix can be identified by the high-energy edge of velocity dispersed ion539\nprecipitation [Rosenbauer et al., 1975; Hill and Reiff, 1977; Burch et al., 1980].540\nRelative to other ionospheric proxies, low-altitude spacecraft particle precipitation ob-541\nservations provide a more direct measurement of the reconnection separatrix in the iono-542\nsphere. However, they only provide limited point measurements of the boundary location543\nas the spacecraft pass across each of the polar regions once in their orbits (typically \u223c100-544\nmin for DMSP spacecraft). Nevertheless, as the most reliable boundary indicators they545\nhave an important role in calibrating other proxies, both in single event studies, and on a546\nmore statistical basis. The following sections discuss some of these large-scale statistical547\ncalibrations.548\n2.3.2. Auroral observations549\nWhen magnetospheric particles precipitate into the denser regions of the lower iono-550\nsphere they collide with other particles to give off light, causing the aurora. The intensity551\nand wavelength of auroral emissions depends partially on the flux, energy and species552\nof the precipitating particles, which is different on either side of the OCB as discussed553\nabove. These auroral emissions can be detected with both ground-based and space-based554\nimagers. Observations of the aurora, particularly in the visible and ultraviolet (UV)555\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 28 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nfrequency bands, provide information about the geographical distributions of the precip-556\nitating particles and their source regions.557\nAuroral observations are made from the ground using all-sky cameras and photometers.558\nThe altitude from which most auroral luminosity is emitted is\u223c110 km (the ionospheric E-559\nregion) [Rees, 1963], and therefore the greatest distance at which aurora can theoretically560\nbe observed (the viewing horizon) is slightly over 1000 km. In practice, the effects of561\nlandscape, vegetation, and optical effects at low elevation angles reduce this viewing562\nhorizon to \u223c300 km. Ground observations can achieve high spatial resolution at the563\nzenith of the camera, but the resolution drops sharply towards the edges of the field-564\nof-view. The temporal resolution of observations can be very high, though is typically565\n\u223c1 min. Uncertainties in the altitude of the auroral emission can lead to inaccuracies in566\nmapping the observations to a geographical grid, and these uncertainties increase away567\nfrom the zenith. Ground-based cameras cannot make observations in inclement weather,568\nnor when the sun is up or during full moon. Consequently, study of the dayside auroral569\noval is limited to a short observational window (a few weeks) near winter solstice, from570\nrestricted locations (e.g. Svalbard in the northern hemisphere).571\nAuroral observations by spacecraft have a potentially complete field-of-view of a single572\nhemisphere. Satellite-based imagers, such as Polar UVI [Torr et al., 1995], can image the573\naurora over an entire polar ionosphere at low spatial resolution (\u223c30 km square at orbit574\napogee) with better than 1-min temporal resolution for prolonged periods of \u223c9 hours575\nper 18-hour orbit. A major advantage of spacecraft imagers is the ability to measure576\nUV emissions, which cannot be detected at the ground due to atmospheric absorption.577\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 29\nUV imagers have the advantage of being able to make observations in sunlight, although578\ndayglow can dominate over the auroral emission at times.579\nAn understanding of the particle precipitation giving rise to the observed auroral lumi-580\nnosity allows the probable source regions, and hence the boundaries between regions, to581\nbe identified. The more energetic (harder) particles typical of the outer magnetosphere582\npenetrate more deeply into the atmosphere before dissipating their energy than the less583\nenergetic (softer) particles found, for example, in the magnetosheath [e.g., Rees, 1963]. In584\nthe dayside ionosphere the OCB is often identified on the ground as the poleward edge of585\nluminosity dominated by green-line emissions (557.7 nm - characteristic of the E-region)586\nresulting from harder precipitation in the magnetosphere and the equatorward edge of587\nred-line dominated luminosity (630.0 nm - characteristic of the F -region) resulting from588\nsofter magnetosheath precipitation [Lockwood et al., 1993]. The ratio of the luminosity589\nof the red- and green-lines at a certain location gives an indication of the characteris-590\ntic energy of the precipitating particles. In the nightside ionosphere, both the red- and591\ngreen-line emissions correspond to precipitation on closed field lines and the open field line592\nregion is typically void of auroral emissions. Thus the OCB is identified as the poleward593\nboundary of either of these emissions, although the red line is thought to be the best594\nindicator [Blanchard et al., 1995].595\nSpace-based observations have been made in a range of UV wavelength bands. Al-596\nthough the auroral oval is typically clearly displayed at most UV wavelengths, it is not a597\ntrivial task to determine the OCB from these images. It is uncertain whether the OCB598\ncorresponds best to an absolute auroral intensity threshold or to a fraction of a maximum599\nintensity. There have been few inter-instrument comparisons which have addressed this600\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 30 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nuncertainty. However, a comprehensive comparison of Polar UVI and DMSP particle pre-601\ncipitation boundaries by Carbary et al. [2003], using images in the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield602\nlong (LBHL) auroral emission band (\u223c160-180 nm), showed that the poleward edge of603\nthe auroral oval in the dayside ionosphere was co-located with the OCB. (The intensity604\nin the LBHL band is considered to be proportional to the energy flux of precipitating605\nelectrons [Germany et al., 1997].) The method of Carbary et al. [2003] fits a Gaussian606\nplus a background quadratic function to a latitudinal profile of the UVI-LBHL auroral607\nimage intensity in a 1-hr MLT bin, and then locates the boundary estimate at a fixed608\npoint on this function (at a distance equivalent to the full-width-at-half-maximum of the609\nGaussian poleward of the Gaussian peak). The LBHL boundary also matches well to the610\nOCB for much of the nightside ionosphere, although an offset (\u223c3\u25e6) exists in the early611\nmorning sector [Kauristie et al., 1999; Baker et al., 2000; Carbary et al., 2003]. In this sec-612\ntor, the poleward boundary of shorter wavelength UV emissions in the 130-140 nm range613\nappears to provide a more reliable proxy for the OCB [Wild et al., 2004]. During active614\ngeomagnetic conditions, such as the substorm expansion phase, the nightside boundary is615\nrelatively clear, as the substorm auroral bulge is a well-defined feature that can be readily616\nidentified in auroral imagery. During more quiescent times, however, the nightside oval617\ncan become relatively faint, such that it is difficult to identify the poleward edge of the618\noval with any great certainty. At these times, the accuracy of the OCB determination619\nwill depend on the sensitivity of the auroral imager.620\nFor our example event study we use the OCB proxy identified in auroral images mea-621\nsured by Polar UVI in the LBHL emission range. Suitable ground-based auroral obser-622\nvations were not available for this interval. In fig.6 we show the auroral image measured623\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 31\nby Polar UVI-LBHL at 2017:34 UT on 26 December 2000 (overlapping the time interval624\nof the convection map shown in fig.5). The orbital position of the polar spacecraft means625\nthat the image coverage is restricted predominantly to the nightside auroral oval. The626\nviewing angle of the spacecraft at this time is such that the resolution in the morning627\nsector is poorer, and hence more uncertainties will be introduced here. The auroral oval628\nis clearly visible, being characterised by the higher intensity emissions. The UVI proxy629\nfor the OCB is determined by averaging the image intensities measured in 1\u25e6 latitude by630\n1-hr MLT sectors and then using the method of Carbary et al. [2003], fitting a function631\nto the latitudinal intensity profiles, as discussed above.632\nFigure 7 presents examples of these fits from the 0100-0200, 1800-1900, and 2300-2400633\nMLT sectors (those regions marked with the blue radial lines in fig.6). The top two pan-634\nels illustrate locations where the fit (dotted line) to the auroral intensity profile (solid635\nhistogram) is very good, although in one case the auroral region covers a much larger636\nlatitudinal range than the other. The boundaries determined in these cases (dashed ver-637\ntical line) appear reasonable and would match closely with other boundary determination638\nmethods. In the final panel the intensity variation appears double-peaked and so the fit is639\nnot so good (although the fit does pass the quality controls set by Carbary et al. [2003]).640\nAs a result, the boundary is placed at a slightly higher latitude than may result from641\nother techniques. This highlights that this technique has a weakness when the latitudinal642\nintensity profile is characterised by more than one peak. A more sophisticated technique643\nwhich is suitable for fitting more than one peak may be an improvement on this method.644\nNotwithstanding this potential weakness in this technique, we still use this method of645\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 32 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nboundary determination in this paper as it is the only one which has been calibrated with646\nan independent OCB data set.647\nThe boundaries determined in this way are shown as black symbols in fig.6. We further648\nuse the statistical boundary offsets determined by Carbary et al. [2003] to adjust our649\nmeasured boundaries to provide more accurate estimates of the OCB. (This is especially650\nsignificant for the measurements in the early morning sector ionosphere). The adjusted651\nboundaries are shown as red symbols in fig.6. Hence, the UVI observations at this time652\nprovide us with OCB estimates across much of the nightside ionosphere. However, they653\nprovide no information about the OCB in the 0700\u20131700 MLT range.654\n2.3.3. The Doppler spectral width boundary655\nThe Doppler spectral width of backscatter measured by the SuperDARN HF radar net-656\nwork is a parameter that reflects the spatial and temporal structure of ionospheric elec-657\ntron density irregularities convecting in the ionospheric convection electric field [Andre\u00b4658\net al., 2000]. As with precipitating particles and auroral observations, the spectral width659\nvaries between regions of different magnetic connectivity and hence across the reconnec-660\ntion separatrix\/OCB, although the physical reasons for these variations are not yet fully661\nunderstood [Ponomarenko and Waters, 2003]. Baker et al. [1995] first showed that re-662\ngions of enhanced Doppler spectral width were associated with regions of cusp particle663\nprecipitation and that the spectral width was reduced equatorward of the cusp. The tran-664\nsition between these low and high spectral width regions has been termed the spectral665\nwidth boundary (SWB) and has subsequently been shown to be a typical feature at all666\nMLTs and not just in the cusp regions [Chisham and Freeman, 2004]. If the SWB was667\nco-located with the OCB at all MLTs then the extensive spatial and temporal coverage668\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 33\nof the SuperDARN radars would allow for the possibility of prolonged monitoring of the669\nseparatrix location and motion. However, methods of detection of the SWB and a full670\nunderstanding of how the boundary relates to the OCB have a history of confusion with671\nconflicting conclusions drawn in different studies.672\nThreshold techniques have been employed to objectively identify the SWB in cusp-region673\nSuperDARN backscatter for some years [Baker et al., 1997; Chisham et al., 2001]. These674\ntechniques involve choosing a spectral width threshold value above which the spectral675\nwidth values are more likely to originate from the distribution of spectral width values676\ntypically found poleward of the OCB, and developing an algorithm that searches poleward677\nalong a radar beam until this threshold is exceeded. Chisham and Freeman [2003] showed678\nthat this technique can be inaccurate in its simplest form as the probability distributions679\nof the spectral width values poleward and equatorward of the SWB are typically broad680\nand have considerable overlap. They showed that the inclusion of additional rules in the681\nthreshold algorithm, such as spatially and temporally median filtering the spectral width682\ndata, increased the accuracy of the estimation of the SWB location. They termed their683\nmethod the \u2018C-F threshold technique\u2019, and that is what we use for our example event684\nanalysis in this paper. Chisham and Freeman [2004] further showed that the technique685\ncould be objectively applied to SWBs at all MLTs. However, SWBs rarely approximate686\ninfinitely sharp latitudinal transitions in spectral width, and hence, the latitude of the687\nSWB is dependent on the spectral width threshold used [Chisham and Freeman, 2004].688\nTo investigate the reliability of the SWBs determined by this method as proxies for the689\nOCB, Chisham et al. [2004a, 2005a, c] compared five years of SWBs (determined using690\nspectral width thresholds of 150 and 200 m\/s) with the particle precipitation signature691\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 34 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nof the OCB measured by the DMSP low-altitude spacecraft [Sotirelis and Newell, 2000].692\nThese studies showed that the SWB is a good proxy for the OCB at most MLTs, with693\nthe exception being in the early morning sector (0200\u20130800 MLT). (Comparing with694\nthe Carbary et al. [2003] study, it was found that the SWB is in fact co-located with695\nthe poleward edge of the LBHL auroral oval). The SWB is most clearly observed in696\nmeridionally-aligned SuperDARN radar beams. As beams become more zonally-aligned,697\ngeometrical factors can become major causes of enhanced spectral width and so can place698\nthe SWB far equatorward of the OCB location [Chisham et al., 2005b].699\nFor the event being studied in this paper, SWBs were available from a number of the700\nmeridionally-aligned SuperDARN radar beams. Importantly, the SWBs measured by the701\nKapuskasing, Kodiak, and Prince George SuperDARN radars provided estimates of the702\nOCB in the dayside region of the ionosphere not covered by the Polar UVI observations.703\nIn fig.8 we illustrate how the C-F threshold technique estimates the SWB for one of these704\nradars at our time of interest (2017 UT on 26 December 2000). Fig.8a presents the raw705\nspectral width values measured by the Kapuskasing radar at this time. Only data from706\nwithin \u00b14 beams of the meridional direction are shown and used. The dashed meridional707\nline shows the location of the 1500 MLT meridian. The spectral width values are highly708\nvariable and appear to be higher in the western side of the field-of-view than in the eastern.709\nFig.8b shows the spectral width variation at this time after the data has been spatially710\nand temporally median filtered. The data are spatially filtered across 3 adjacent beams711\nand temporally filtered across 5 adjacent scans, as described by Chisham and Freeman712\n[2004]. In fig.8b the longitudinal change in spectral width has become clearer as well as713\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 35\nthe latitudinal transition from low to high spectral width around 73\u25e6 which provides our714\nestimate of the OCB.715\nA threshold method is now applied to the spectral width data in fig.8b to provide our716\nestimates for the OCB location. Fig.8c shows the result of thresholding the spectral width717\ndata at 150 m\/s (the most suitable spectral width threshold value for this MLT sector).718\nThe grey region highlights where the spectral width was less than 150 m\/s, the black region719\nwhere it was greater than 150 m\/s. The threshold technique involves searching poleward720\nup each radar beam and finding the first range gate at which the spectral width is greater721\nthan 150 m\/s and for which two of the subsequent three range gates also have spectral722\nwidth values greater than 150 m\/s. For this time, SWBs could only be determined for the723\nfour beams to the western side of the field-of-view. The SWB locations are highlighted724\nby the four white squares in fig.8c. (Note that the absence of a measurable SWB on the725\neastern side of the field-of-view does not imply the absence of the OCB).726\n2.3.4. Other proxies727\nHere, we briefly discuss two further proxies for the OCB that we do not make use728\nof in the event study presented here but which are potentially useful OCB proxies for729\nreconnection rate measurement studies.730\nThe convection reversal boundary (CRB) is located where the ionospheric convection731\nchanges from being sunward (typical of closed field lines) to antisunward (typical of open732\nfield lines). If all closed field lines flowed sunward and all open field lines flowed anti-733\nsunward then the CRB and the OCB would coincide. However, there are other factors734\nthat influence where one determines the CRB, namely the reference frame of observa-735\ntion(corotating vs. inertial), and the effect of viscous convection cells [Reiff and Burch,736\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 36 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\n1985]. The change in reference frame from inertial to the corotational frame of the Super-737\nDARN observations moves the latitude of the CRB poleward. Considering the contribu-738\ntion from a viscous cell would also move the CRB latitude poleward. Newell et al. [1991]739\nshowed that the CRB in the inertial frame in the dayside ionosphere was typically located740\nwithin the LLBL, on closed field lines. Sotirelis et al. [2005] performed a large statistical741\ncomparison of OCB and CRB locations in the corotation frame at all MLTs and showed742\nthat the CRB correlates well with the OCB. They did identify an equatorward offset of743\nthe CRB relative to the OCB that varied from zero near noon to \u223c1\u25e6 near dawn and dusk744\nand to \u223c2\u25e6 near midnight.745\nIt is also possible to use incoherent scatter radar (ISR) measurements to estimate the746\nOCB location. Doe et al. [1997] used ISR to measure the characteristic energies of pre-747\ncipitating electrons across a range of latitudes. Sharp latitudinal gradients in the char-748\nacteristic energy can be used to estimate the OCB location. Latitudinal transitions in749\nionospheric electron density measured by ISR can also be used as OCB proxies. Particle750\nprecipitation in the auroral oval enhances the electron density in the ionosphere through751\nenhanced ionization. In the nightside ionosphere the poleward boundary of the auroral752\noval is characterised by a sharp latitudinal cut-off of electron density in the E-region. This753\ndensity proxy was used in estimating reconnection rates by de la Beaujardie`re et al. [1991]754\nand Blanchard et al. [1997].755\n2.3.5. The effect of convection on offsetting proxies from the true separatrix756\nIn regions where reconnection is ongoing, there is an argument as to how the effects757\nof the convection of newly-reconnected field lines affect the reliability of the ionospheric758\nproxies for the reconnection separatrix. It has been suggested that there typically exists a759\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 37\nsmall (<1\u25e6) latitudinal displacement between the true separatrix location and the proxy760\ndue to the effects of the convection of newly-reconnected field lines. In the cusp, for761\nexample, the fastest precipitating magnetosheath-like ions which characterise the newly-762\nopened field lines take a finite time to travel from the reconnection site (assuming this to763\nbe their place of origin) to the ionosphere, during which time the footprints of the field764\nlines down which these ions are traveling have been convected away from the separatrix765\nlocation [Rodger and Pinnock, 1997; Lockwood, 1997; Rodger, 2000]. Hence, the ionospheric766\nsignature of these ions will be observed poleward of the footprint of the field line which767\npresently connects to the reconnection X-line. Here, we assume that any offset due to768\nthese effects is smaller than the latitudinal resolution of our velocity vector measurements769\n(\u223c1\u25e6 latitude).770\n2.3.6. Estimating the complete separatrix location and motion from discrete771\nobservations772\nThe instrumental techniques described above generally provide discrete measurements773\nof the OCB location at a number of particular times and locations. For small-scale774\nreconnection rate determinations, closely-spaced discrete measurements of the OCB can775\nbe employed using the techniques outlined in section 2.1.2. To measure the reconnection776\nrate on a more global scale requires either global OCB measurements or some method of777\ninterpolation of sparse measurements of the OCB. The simplest assumption that can be778\nrealistically used when interpolating ionospheric OCB estimates is that the OCB can be779\napproximated by a circle (used in calculating reconnection rates by Pinnock et al. [2003]).780\nHolzworth and Meng [1975] and Meng et al. [1977] showed that an off-centre circle in781\ngeomagnetic co-ordinates was a good fit to the poleward boundary of quiet auroral arcs782\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 38 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nand hence, provided a good global estimate of the OCB. However, if the MLT coverage783\nof OCB estimates is relatively extensive then there are better techniques which allow a784\nmore accurate characterisation of the boundary.785\nIt is possible to approximate the OCB in terms of a Fourier series of order Nt,786\n\u03bb(P(\u03c6)) = A0 +\nNt\u2211\nn=1\nAn cos(n\u03c6 + \u03c8n) (27)787\nwhere A0, An and \u03c8n are constants of the fit. With sparse measurements of the OCB788\nlocation a global OCB estimate can be determined by least squares fitting a low order789\n(Nt < 3) Fourier series to the measured OCB locations, similar to the approach taken by790\nHolzworth and Meng (1975) for describing the auroral oval. When estimates of the OCB791\nlocation are available from a wider range of MLTs, higher order Fourier series can be used792\nto better describe the data. However, fitting to such higher order Fourier series is fraught793\nwith problems due to the many (2n+1) free parameters, and local minima in the 2n+1794\nparameter space.795\nInstead, following the example of Milan et al. [2003], we adopt a Fourier series derived796\nfrom a truncated Fourier transform of the estimated OCB locations. First we divide the797\npolar ionosphere into Nb equally sized MLT bins (the choice of Nb is typically dependent798\non the spatial and temporal resolution of the available boundary data). For bins where799\none or more estimates of the OCB exist we take the mean of those estimates as the OCB800\nlocation at the center of that bin (\u03bb(Pi), i = 1...Nb). (This can be a weighted mean801\nif required, e.g., if the estimates from one instrumental source are more reliable than802\nanother). For bins where no estimate exists we interpolate between the OCB locations803\non either side to obtain an estimate of the OCB location for that bin. We then take the804\nFourier transform of these values and ignore the higher order terms (those greater than805\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 39\nNt, the order of the Fourier series that we require). This truncated Fourier series can then806\nbe used to define the OCB at any MLT. The reason for removing the higher order terms807\nis that a complete Fourier series gives an exact fit to the input estimates and for locations808\naway from the bin centres spurious results may exist (much in the same way as fitting an809\nexact polynomial to data with uncertainties can give rise to unrealistic estimates between810\ndata points). It is worth noting that the truncated Fourier series is equivalent to a least811\nsquares fit of a Fourier series of this order.812\nAs an example of this process, in fig.9 we illustrate how we detemine the global OCB813\nvariation for the interval 2017\u20132018 UT on 26 December 2000 (the same interval as in814\nprevious figures). Often, due to the coarse latitudinal resolution of many techniques used815\nto locate the OCB, the measurement of the OCB latitude contains significant quantization816\nnoise which is amplified when determining the time derivative for the boundary motion817\n[Pinnock et al., 1999]. Therefore, it is often advisable to temporally smooth the time series818\nof the boundary location in some way to reduce this effect. Here, we have achieved this819\nby mean filtering across a 3-min interval centred on our minute of interest. The squares820\nin fig.9 show all the UVI boundaries measured for the 3-min interval centred on this time.821\nSimilarly, the diamonds show all the SWBs measured for the 3-min interval centred on822\nthis time. We take the mean latitude value in each 1-hr MLT sector to determine the823\nglobal boundary (using Nb = 24). This spatiotemporal smoothing provides a level of824\nstatistical reliability to the values used in our Fourier expansion, as well as reducing the825\nuncertainty in our individual estimates of the boundary location (we assume this to be826\nby a factor of\n\u221a\nN , where N is the number of OCB estimates in the bin). In fig.9 we also827\npresent the results of characterising the OCB as a truncated Fourier series with Nt = 6828\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 40 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\n(6th order - dashed line) and Nt = 10 (10th order - bold solid line), as explained above.829\nObviously, the wider the extent of the data coverage, the higher the order of the Fourier830\nexpansion can be. In this case, where the global coverage is quite good it can be clearly831\nseen that on the nightside, the 10th order expansion fits better to the observed data than832\ndoes the 6th order. The fits to the data elsewhere are very similar for both orders. Hence833\nwe use the 10th order expansion in this study.834\nIt is instructive to study how using different instrumentation, assumptions, and data835\nresolution affects the velocity of the OCB that we ultimately determine and use in the836\nreconnection rate calculations. One way to study this is to look at the distributions of837\nthe boundary velocities that we observe in different cases. In fig.10a we show boundary838\nvelocity distributions determined from the raw Polar UVI observations for our complete839\nevent interval (2000-2200 UT). The solid line shows the distribution of boundary velocities840\ndetermined using temporally adjacent boundary measurements (every \u223c37 s). Any effects841\ndue to noise\/random errors in the determination of the OCB latitude from the UVI data842\nwill be clearest in this distribution (i.e., the uncertainties will be largest, equation (24)).843\nThe distribution is very broad with significant numbers of velocities with magnitudes844\nof \u223c4000 m\/s or higher (this velocity is equivalent to \u223c2\u25e6 latitude in a minute). The845\ndashed line shows the distribution of boundary velocities determined using measurements846\nthat are 2 samples apart (every \u223c74 s). It is clear that the width of the distribution847\nhas been reduced. Similarly, the dotted line shows the distribution of boundary velocities848\ndetermined using measurements that are 4 samples apart (every \u223c148 s). Again, the width849\nof the distribution has been reduced such that there are very few boundary velocities850\nmeasured greater than \u223c2000 m\/s. This figure shows how data of different temporal851\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 41\nresolution, from the same data set, will provide a very different distribution of boundary852\nvelocities.853\nIn fig.10b we show boundary velocity distributions determined from the filtered Polar854\nUVI observations for the complete event interval (2000-2200 UT). The solid line shows the855\ndistribution of boundary velocities when using the mean-filtered UVI data (3-min averag-856\ning window at 1-min resolution). The filtering has the effect of thinning the distribution857\nin a similar way to a reduction in the temporal resolution. This is a result of the reduction858\nof the effects of noise and random errors in the data following this averaging process (as859\nwell as the reduction of genuine rapid, large amplitude fluctuations). The dashed and860\ndotted lines in fig.10b present the boundary velocity distributions determined from the861\n6th and 10th order Fourier series OCBs, respectively. These two distributions are almost862\nidentical and hence there is no sign of an enhanced level of fluctuations being introduced863\nfor the higher order Fourier series. This further supports our use of the 10th order Fourier864\nexpansion in this study.865\nAs discussed in section 2.1.1, the variation in the polar cap area provides information866\nabout the net reconnection voltage. Having a global representation of the OCB allows867\nthis area to be easily estimated. Assuming a spherical Earth, the polar cap area can be868\nestimated by,869\nApc =\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\n(RE + h)\n2(1\u2212 sin \u03bb(P(\u03c6))) d\u03c6 (28)870\nIn a discrete form, assuming N OCB estimates equally spaced in AACGM longitude \u03c6871\nwe can write this as,872\nApc =\n2\u03c0(RE + h)\n2\nN\nN\u22121\u2211\ni=0\n(1\u2212 sin \u03bb(Pi)) (29)873\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 42 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nWe can apply these techniques to study the polar cap area for the whole of the two-hour874\ninterval being studied on this day (2000\u20132200 UT) (see following section for complete875\nresults).876\nIn fig.11 we present 1-min snapshots of the estimated OCB made every 10 min during877\nthis interval. The squares represent the UVI and SWB boundaries used to determine the878\nOCB at each time. The bold lines represent 10th order Fourier expansions at each time.879\nFor most of the interval the data coverage is particularly good leading to very reliable880\nglobal boundary estimates. However, towards the end of the interval the data coverage881\nis more patchy and so the global OCB estimates are less reliable. From fig.11 we can882\nsee that initially, the approximately circular polar cap expands, reaching its largest size883\naround \u223c2040 UT. At this point the polar cap starts to shrink and becomes more oval884\nshaped around \u223c2110 UT. Towards the end of the interval the polar cap shrinks to a885\nsmall size and the boundary is distinctly non-circular. We quantify this polar cap size886\nvariation further in the following section.887\n3. Reconnection rate measurements\n3.1. Spatial variation of the reconnection rate\nBy combining measurements of the ionospheric convection velocity and of the OCB888\nlocation and motion at a particular time, we can determine the spatial variation of the889\nreconnection rate at that time using the techniques outlined in section 2.1. In figure 12 we890\nshow again the northern hemisphere SuperDARN convection map, originally presented in891\nfigure 5, for the 1-min interval that we have focussed on (2017\u20132018 UT) on 26 December892\n2000. Overplotted on the convection map is the global OCB location (bold line) as893\ndetermined for this same interval as shown in fig.9. The next step is to select discrete894\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 43\nvelocity vectors on, or close to, the OCB which will be used in the reconnection rate895\nestimation. This is a trivial exercise in regions where the vectors are co-located with896\nthe OCB. However, there are some regions where the selected vectors are, by necessity,897\n\u223c0.5\u25e6-1.0\u25e6 away from the OCB. The grey shading in fig.12 highlights the velocity vectors898\nselected for this example interval. Whereas the overlap of vectors with the OCB is good899\non the dayside (from \u223c0800 MLT through to 1800 MLT), the coverage on the nightside900\nis not so good with the vectors being sparse from \u223c2230 to \u223c0300 MLT and being absent901\nfrom \u223c0300 to \u223c0600 MLT. This is the case for most of the interval under study.902\nIn fig.13 we present the spatial variation (with MLT) of the reconnection rate measure-903\nments. Positive reconnection rates relate to flux being added to the polar cap whereas904\nnegative reconnection rates relate to flux being removed from the polar cap. Hence for905\nmost IMF conditions, including the IMF By-dominated conditions observed at this time906\n(see fig.14 for full details of the IMF conditions), we would typically expect positive recon-907\nnection rates in the dayside ionosphere and negative reconnection rates in the nightside908\nionosphere. We present the total estimated reconnection rate for our 1-min interval in909\nfig.13a, but we also separate the measurements into the contributions from the plasma flow910\n(Bzi|Vi| cos \u03b8i in equation 11) (fig.13b) and the contributions from the boundary motion911\n(Bzi|VPi| cos\u03b1 in equation 11) (fig.13c). The bold black line and grey shaded region in912\nfig.13a represent the mean and standard deviation of the reconnection rate measurements913\nmeasured in a 2-hour MLT sliding window. This helps to illustrate the gross features in914\nthe spatial variation of the reconnection rate.915\nThe contributions from the plasma flow (panel b) are much as expected for most IMF916\nconditions reflecting the standard two-cell ionospheric convection pattern; poleward flow917\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 44 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nacross the OCB in the dayside ionosphere and equatorward flow across the OCB in the918\nnightside ionosphere. The uncertainties in these measurements are estimated as shown in919\nsection 2.1.3. Using the results of Provan et al. [2002] as a guide for estimating the uncer-920\ntainties in \u2018true\u2019 velocity vectors, we estimate the uncertainty in the velocity magnitude921\nas \u223c25% (a1 = 0.25) and the uncertainty in the angle the vector makes with the normal922\nto the separatrix as \u223c45\u25e6 (a2 = \u03c0\/4 \u2248 0.79). We can then rewrite the error equation (20)923\nas,924\n\u03b5\u3008|Vi(t)| cos \u03b8i(t)\u3009 \u2248 |Vi(t)|\n(\n0.0625 cos2 \u03b8i(t)\u2212 0.617 sin2 \u03b8i(t)\n) 1\n2 . (30)925\nand so the uncertainty values range from 0.25|Vi(t)| when \u03b8i(t) = 0\u25e6 to 0.79|Vi(t)| when926\n\u03b8i(t) = 90\n\u25e6. Hence, the largest uncertainties in the contribution from the plasma flow927\noccur around \u223c1500 MLT where the convection flows are aligned close to parallel with928\nthe estimated OCB.929\nThe contributions from the boundary motion (fig.13c) are characterised by larger uncer-930\ntainties. We assume that the latitudinal uncertainty in our raw OCB measurements (from931\nboth Polar UVI and SuperDARN SWBs) is \u223c0.5\u25e6 (\u223c50 km), as discussed in previous sec-932\ntions. As measurements are made every minute, then using equation (24) to provide an933\nestimate of the uncertainty in the separatrix motion would give \u223c830 m\/s. However, this934\nis reduced by dividing by\n\u221a\nN to account for the temporal smoothing over N boundary935\nestimates, as discussed in section 2.3.6. (As an aside, if measurements are made every 5936\nminutes then the basic uncertainty reduces to \u223c165 m\/s.) It must also be remembered937\nthat there are regions of the boundary (shown by the bold symbols in fig.13c) where938\ngaps in the raw OCB data exist and where the boundary has been interpolated. Hence,939\nthe boundary estimates in these regions may be questionable. Figure 13c suggests that940\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 45\nthe contributions to the total reconnection rate from the boundary motion are as large941\nas those from the plasma flow, but that the magnitude of the contribution is spatially942\nvariable.943\nWe can describe the spatial variations in the reconnection rate as shown in figure fig.13a944\nin the following way. In the dayside ionosphere we expect positive reconnection rates945\nwhich represent magnetic flux being added to the polar cap following reconnection on the946\ndayside magnetopause. This is generally the case in fig.13a although the reconnection947\nrate appears to reduce to zero close to noon. This spatial variation in reconnection948\nrate is consistent with a split reconnection X-line on the magnetopause and matches the949\nvariation predicted by the anti-parallel merging hypothesis during conditions dominated950\nby the IMF By component close to the winter solstice [Coleman et al., 2001; Chisham951\net al., 2002], matching the conditions for this example event (see section 3.2). In the952\nnightside ionosphere we expect negative reconnection rates which represent magnetic flux953\nbeing removed from the polar cap following reconnection in the magnetotail. This is954\ngenerally the case for most of this interval although there are a couple of regions (\u223c1830\u2013955\n2000 MLT and \u223c0200\u20130300 MLT) where positive reconnection rates are measured. Most956\nof the contribution towards these positive reconnection rates comes from the boundary957\nmotion. As it is unlikely that flux is being added to the polar cap at these locations it958\nis therefore likely that the estimation of the boundary motion is in error and hence, that959\nthe uncertainties in the boundary motion have been underestimated in these regions. As960\ndiscussed in section 2.1.3, measuring reconnection rates at a high temporal resolution (e.g.,961\nat the 1-min sampling rate used here) requires a significant accuracy of measurements of962\nthe OCB location and motion. The large uncertainties in our results suggest that there are963\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 46 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nstill some improvements to be made before the boundary measurements can be measured964\naccurately enough to fully match the requirements of the 1-min convection measurements.965\n3.2. Temporal variation of the reconnection potential\nFigure 14 presents the temporal variation of the average reconnection rate from both966\nthe dayside and nightside ionosphere corresponding to magnetopause and magnetotail967\nreconnection, respectively. To place the reconnection rate measurements in context, panel968\n14a shows the By and Bz components of the IMF for this interval as measured by the ACE969\nspacecraft located upstream in the solar wind. The IMF variations have been shifted by970\n63 min to account for the solar wind travel time between the spacecraft and the Earth\u2019s971\nmagnetosphere. Panel 14b shows the associated IMF clock angle. At the start of the972\ninterval the IMF is in transition from being predominantly southward (not shown) to being973\ndawnward (at \u223c2010 UT). For the rest of the 2-hour interval, although the Bz component974\nis positive, the IMF is very much By-dominated with the IMF clock angle fluctuating975\nbetween -70\u25e6 and -90\u25e6. Although the IMF is slightly northward, the existence of normal976\ntwo-cell convection at this time (and the previous observations of two-cell convection for977\nthese IMF conditions [Freeman et al., 1993; Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996]), suggests978\nthat reconnection is occurring sunward of the cusp region for these conditions, rather than979\non the lobe magnetopause. Hence, magnetopause reconnection will be responsible for the980\naddition of flux to the polar cap at the OCB during this interval. The two vertical dashed981\nlines in fig.14 show the timing of a substorm onset and a substorm intensification identified982\nfrom a combination of auroral brightenings in the Polar UVI data, the occurrence of Pi2983\npulsations and the initiation of negative bays in ground-based magnetometer data. These984\nevents would be expected to be associated with enhanced reconnection in the magnetotail.985\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 47\nFigure 14c presents the variation in polar cap area during this interval, estimated using986\nthe techniques outlined in section 2.3.6. At the start of the interval (\u223c2000-2040 UT),987\nfollowing the interval of southward IMF, the polar cap is expanding, indicating that988\nmagnetic flux is being added to the polar cap by magnetopause reconnection at a faster989\nrate than it is being removed by magnetotail reconnection. Following a substorm onset at990\n\u223c2037 UT (and hence enhanced magnetotail reconnection) the polar cap starts to contract991\nat \u223c2040 UT. Following a substorm intensification at \u223c2051 UT the rate of contraction992\nincreases before the polar cap size stabilizes at \u223c2100 UT. At around \u223c2120 UT the polar993\ncap appears to start contracting again (although the polar cap areas are less reliable at994\nthis time because of the reduction in the global coverage of the OCB estimates). The polar995\ncap reaches a steady, minimum size at \u223c2130 UT. The measured change in the polar cap996\narea across this interval provides a good estimate of the net reconnection voltage and it is997\ngenerally clear from the gradient of the curve as to whether magnetopause or magnetotail998\nreconnection is the dominant process at any one time.999\nIf we want to study the temporal variation of the reconnection rate (or voltage) in more1000\ndetail then we need to be able to differentiate between the magnetopause (dayside) and1001\nmagnetotail (nightside) reconnection rates. Because we do not always have a full comple-1002\nment of velocity vectors along each of the merging lines it is often difficult to calculate1003\na complete reconnection voltage for either the magnetopause or magnetotail X-line. One1004\nalternative, when limited data are available, is to present the average reconnection rate1005\n(< Erec >) measured along the portions of each merging line over which the measurements1006\nwere made. If an estimate of the total length of the merging line can also be made then1007\nthis allows an estimate of the total reconnection voltage along the merging line.1008\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 48 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nIn figs.14d and 14e we present the temporal variations of the average dayside and night-1009\nside reconnection rates, respectively (bold black lines). The average dayside (nightside)1010\nrates were calculated from vectors sunward (anti-sunward) of the 0600-1800 MLT line.1011\nFor both the dayside and nightside reconnection rates the level of fluctuation is quite high1012\nwith the point-to-point variability being of similar size to the average electric field values.1013\nHowever, it is difficult to assess how much of this fluctuation is real, caused by tempo-1014\nral burstiness of the reconnection process, and how much is caused by uncertainties in1015\nthe measured quantities. The occurrence of \u2018unphysical\u2019 negative reconnection rate mea-1016\nsurements in the dayside ionosphere and positive reconnection rate measurements in the1017\nnightside ionosphere suggests that there are times when the measurements may be inade-1018\nquate. This supports our previous suggestion that the OCB cannot presently be measured1019\naccurately enough to match the requirements of 1-min convection measurements.1020\nThe white lines in figs.14d and 14e present the variation of the average of the average1021\nreconnection rates measured within a 15-min sliding window (the grey region represents1022\nthe average of the error estimates in the same window). The white lines act to highlight1023\nthe general trends in the reconnection rate variations by removing the point-to-point1024\nvariability. At the beginning of the interval the average dayside reconnection rate is \u223c201025\nmV\/m whereas that on the nightside varies between 0 and -10 mV\/m. The dayside rate1026\ndecreases slightly with time to \u223c10 mV\/m, whereas, following the substorm onset, the1027\nnightside rate changes to \u223c-40 mV\/m, dominating the dayside rate. At this time, the size1028\nof the fluctuations in the nightside rate become much larger, although this may be due1029\nto the reduction in the size of the measurable nightside merging line. Towards the end of1030\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 49\nthe interval the average nightside reconnection rate appears to reduce to a similar level1031\nas the dayside rate leading to a stability in the polar cap area.1032\nIt is possible, using equation (9), to perform a consistency check on the polar cap1033\narea and average reconnection rate measurements. Since this requires knowledge of the1034\nmagnetopause and magnetotail reconnection voltages, we need to assume lengths for the1035\ndayside and nightside merging lines. Here, we have derived a large number of polar cap1036\narea variations from the average reconnection rate measurements (black lines in figs.14d1037\nand e) by assuming merging line lengths from 0.1 hours of MLT to 12.0 hours of MLT (in1038\n0.1 hour steps). Using a least squares fit we have then determined which of these variations1039\nbest matches the observed polar cap area variation. In fig.15a we present the observed1040\npolar cap area variation (as shown in fig.14c). We also show (dashed line) the best fit1041\npolar cap area variation determined from the average reconnection rate measurements.1042\nThe best fit occurred when a dayside merging line length of 12 hours of MLT, and a1043\nnightside merging line length of 7.6 hours of MLT, were assumed. Although the general1044\nvariation of the two curves in fig.15a is very similar, the gradients in the three distinct1045\nregions of the curve are slightly different, leading to offsets between the curves at the1046\nbeginning and end of the data sets.1047\nIt is fair to assume that the merging line lengths are unlikely to be constant across1048\nthe whole of this interval. Consequently, we have split the data set into three distinct1049\nsections before repeating the fitting process on each section. The sections were selected1050\nby the gradients in the polar cap area variation - where the area is clearly increasing,1051\nwhere the area is sharply decreasing, and where the area is stable or gradually decreasing.1052\nFigure 15b presents the best fit polar cap area variations determined from the average1053\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 50 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nreconnection rate measurements in each of these sections. The fits in each section are now1054\nvery good and follow the measured variations in the polar cap area closely. The merging1055\nline lengths which provide the best fits are different in each section. At the beginning1056\nof the interval, where the polar cap is expanding and the dayside reconnection rate is1057\ndominant over the nightside reconnection rate, the length of the dayside and nightside1058\nmerging lines are predicted to be 8.0 and 3.2 hours of MLT, respectively. When the polar1059\ncap starts to contract at \u223c2040 UT not only does the average nightside reconnection1060\nrate increase (as shown in fig.14e), but the predicted length of the nightside merging line1061\nalso increases to 9.2 hours of MLT. The predicted length of the dayside merging line also1062\nincreases but by a smaller amount to 10.0 hours of MLT. When the speed of contraction1063\nof the polar cap reduces at \u223c2105 UT the predicted length of the nightside merging line1064\nreduces slightly to 7.2 hours of MLT, whereas that of the dayside merging line increases1065\nslightly to 12.0 hours of MLT.1066\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nSo far in this paper we have provided a synthesis of the techniques for measuring the1067\nionospheric projection of the magnetic reconnection rate (section 2) and given an example1068\nof its application (section 3). The final stage of ionospheric remote sensing of reconnec-1069\ntion is mapping of the measurements in the ionosphere to the reconnection site on the1070\nmagnetopause or magnetotail. This mapping is essential for a full understanding of the1071\nreconnection process because it is at these locations that reconnection actually takes place.1072\nHowever, in our view, it is not yet clear how best to do this mapping and it is also prob-1073\nably subject to large systematic and random uncertainty. For this reason, we have not1074\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 51\nincluded mapping in the main technique section but instead discuss here the two main1075\noptions and their associated problems and uncertainties.1076\nIdeally, one would like to perform an inverse mapping of ionospheric measurements of1077\nthe reconnection electric field to the reconnection site to provide an estimate of the in-situ1078\nreconnection rate [Pinnock et al., 2003; Chisham et al., 2004b]. This may be achieved using1079\na magnetospheric magnetic field model under the assumption that the electric potential1080\nis invariant along a magnetic field line. At present, the state of the art in magnetosphere1081\nmodels is the Tsyganenko model [Tsyganenko, 1995; Tsyganenko and Stern, 1996], the1082\nmost widely used model in this context. The major difficulty with a magnetic field model1083\nsuch as the Tsyganenko model is that it is derived in part from large sets of spacecraft data,1084\nand represents the average configuration of the magnetospheric field, given a particular1085\nset of input parameters. The magnetic field at a particular instant may deviate from this1086\nconfiguration, rendering the field line tracing inaccurate. Furthermore, any error in the1087\ninitial position in the ionosphere is amplified under inverse mapping due to the general1088\ndivergence of the magnetic field with altitude. Inverse mapping is most reliable in the1089\nsteady state (when variations in the magnetospheric field are small) and in the dayside1090\nionosphere (where the model fields are typically more reliable), such as in the remote1091\nsensing studies of Pinnock et al. [2003] and Chisham et al. [2004b]. However, inverse1092\nmapping has not been applied to the remote sensing of magnetotail reconnection during1093\na substorm, such as the case study presented in this paper and that presented by Lam1094\net al. [2006], because the magnetic field model of the magnetotail will be unreliable at1095\ntimes of rapidly changing magnetic field (e.g., at substorm onset). The accuracy of, and1096\nconfidence in, inverse mapping can be improved by calibrating with in-situ spacecraft1097\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 52 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nmeasurements where available. For example, Pinnock et al. [2003] used magnetopause1098\ncrossings identified by the Geotail and Equator-S satellites to re-scale the size of the1099\nTsyganenko model used in their mapping (by adjusting the solar wind dynamic pressure1100\ninput) and showed that the remotely sensed reconnection rate was consistent with in-situ1101\npoint samples in location and magnitude. The importance of accurate inverse mapping to1102\nthe interpretation of observations is well illustrated in the results of Chisham et al. [2002]1103\nwhere the reconnection electric field in the ionosphere is highly asymmetric (being high1104\nin the post-noon sector, and low in the pre-noon sector) but is relatively symmetric when1105\nmapped to the magnetopause [Freeman et al., 2007].1106\nCurrently, the more reliable way of using the ionospheric remote sensing technique to1107\nstudy reconnection problems is to use a forward mapping method. In this approach a1108\nreconnection model or scenario is tested by predicting the ionospheric projection of the1109\nreconnection electric field for direct comparison with the remote sensing observations. This1110\nhas the advantage over inverse mapping in that positional uncertainties at the reconnection1111\nsite decrease on mapping to the ionosphere rather than grow. In addition, the effects of1112\ninstrument error, data gaps, and data assimilation methods can be more readily simulated.1113\nEven better is to use forward mapping to test alternative reconnection models within a1114\ncommon global framework. In this case the different reconnection models are both subject1115\nto similar errors from the magnetic field model and other effects in the forward mapping.1116\nHence, the acceptance of a reconnection model is based on relative, rather than absolute,1117\nagreement with the observations. This was effectively the approach used by Coleman et al.1118\n[2001] and Chisham et al. [2002] to differentiate between the subsolar and anti-parallel1119\nmodels of reconnection. In these studies a distinctive difference in the variation of the1120\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 53\nelectric field along the ionospheric projection of the magnetopause X-line was identified1121\nbetween the two reconnection models for specific IMF, magnetic dipole tilt, and polar1122\nhemisphere conditions that, when compared to observations, provided evidence in favour1123\nof the anti-parallel reconnection model.1124\nWhether using inverse or forward mapping, ionospheric remote sensing of reconnection1125\nrelies on a connection between the reconnection site and the ionosphere by a magnetic1126\nfield line. If multiple reconnection X-lines exist simultaneously, this can mean that some1127\nof these sites are effectively invisible to the ground. For example, during the substorm1128\nexpansion phase, near-Earth and distant magnetotail reconnection sites are expected to1129\nco-exist. Assuming dawn-dusk symmetry, near-Earth reconnection initially reconnects1130\nclosed magnetic flux created by the distant reconnection site and both sites are connected1131\nto the ionosphere, but at a later time near-Earth reconnection reconnects open magnetic1132\nflux and detaches the distant reconnection site from the ionosphere. In the case of self-1133\norganised criticality or turbulent reconnection, numerous reconnection sites are expected1134\nto co-exist [Klimas et al., 2000] and it is unlikely that all of these will connect to the1135\nionosphere. Thus an inverse mapping of the ionospheric reconnection electric field will1136\nnot give a valid representation of the reconnection scenario, but it may be possible to1137\npredict the structure of the ionospheric projection of the reconnection electric field using1138\nforward mapping, to compare with observation.1139\nAssuming that a connection between the reconnection X-line and the ionosphere exists,1140\nit is crucial to be able to identify the ground-based projection of the reconnection X-1141\nline. As discussed in section 2.3, doing this usually involves exploiting the differences1142\nin the particle precipitation signatures between open and closed magnetic field lines.1143\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 54 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nHowever, when reconnection only reconfigures magnetic field lines, and does not change1144\nthe magnetic topology (such as with lobe reconnection during northward IMF conditions),1145\nthen other identifiers are required. For northward IMF conditions, a suitable identifier1146\ncan be the velocity dispersion of precipitating ions from the reconnection site. Similar1147\nvelocity-dispersed ion signatures are also seen in the nightside auroral zone and could be1148\nan identifier for near-earth reconnection during the early substorm expansion phase.1149\nIn conclusion, we have provided a synthesis of the technique for remotely sensing the1150\nmagnetic reconnection rate from the ionosphere and discussed associated problems and1151\nuncertainties. In doing so, we have shown how the remote sensing technique has developed1152\nfrom single point measurements to covering a wide range of spatial scales almost up to the1153\nglobal scale. The example event presented here demonstrates that remote sensing of an1154\nentire reconnection X-line is viable by a combination of the existing SuperDARN network1155\nand spacecraft auroral imagers, which would be unfeasible by in-situ spacecraft. Further1156\nexpansion of SuperDARN in both the northern and southern hemispheres is planned1157\n[Chisham et al., 2007]. This coincides with an era of unprecedented auroral imaging with1158\nthe forthcoming NASA Themis mission and its associated ground-based instruments, and1159\nfuture missions such as the Chinese (and European) Space Agency Kuafu spacecraft.1160\nThese will give continuous observations of the auroral oval in one hemisphere and regular1161\nobservations of the auroral oval in both hemispheres. This expansion in instrumentation1162\nshould allow remote sensing of both magnetopause and magnetotail reconnection sites1163\ncompletely and simultaneously.1164\nThis remote sensing capability opens up new opportunities for understanding the re-1165\nconnection process that is fundamental to the behaviour of not only the Earth\u2019s magne-1166\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nCHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION X - 55\ntosphere but to many natural astrophysical environments and artificial fusion reactors.1167\nProgress has already been made in using the remote sensing technique to address the1168\noutstanding reconnection questions of the Earth\u2019s environment posed in the Introduction,1169\nconcerning the location, extent and controlling factors of reconnection: The reconnection1170\nX-line at the magnetopause has been found to extend over 38 RE under stable due south-1171\nward IMF conditions, corresponding to the entire dayside equatorial magnetopause and1172\nbeyond the dawn and dusk flanks into the magnetotail [Pinnock et al., 2003]. In contrast,1173\nfor stable due northward IMF the reconnection X-line was found to be limited to 6-11 RE1174\nin the high-latitude lobes of the magnetotail [Chisham et al., 2004b]. For intermediate1175\nIMF orientations, the remote sensing technique has provided evidence that the reconnec-1176\ntion X-line at the magnetopause is bifurcated, existing in two distinct regions on the high1177\nlatitude magnetopause equatorward of the cusps [Coleman et al., 2001; Chisham et al.,1178\n2002]. This is in contrast to the single magnetopause X-line extending between these1179\nregions through the subsolar region that is inferred for these IMF conditions from in-situ1180\nspacecraft observations [Fear et al., 2005]. This paradox needs to be reconciled. In the1181\nmagnetotail, the ionospheric projection of the reconnection X-line is found to increase1182\nin length following substorm onset, in one case from 3.2 hours of MLT in the substorm1183\ngrowth phase to 9.2 hours of MLT in the substorm expansion phase (see example discussed1184\nin previous section) and in another from 4 hours to 7 hours of MLT in the first 15 min of1185\nthe expansion phase [Lam et al., 2006], although the corresponding location and length1186\nof the reconnection X-line in the magnetotail has not been estimated in these cases (as1187\ndiscussed above).1188\nD R A F T September 7, 2007, 3:34pm D R A F T\nX - 56 CHISHAM ET AL.: REMOTE SENSING OF RECONNECTION\nThe reconnection questions being addressed in the terrestrial context have relevance1189\nto more general reconnection problems. For example, the remote sensing measurements1190\nof magnetopause reconnection summarised above argue that reconnection is restricted to1191\nregions of high magnetic shear and that consequently the relative geometry of magnetic1192\nfields is the principal factor determining the overall reconnection rate [Freeman et al.,1193\n2007], and hence, the dynamical behaviour of magnetised plasmas in general, an assump-1194\ntion that is invoked in the context of the solar corona [Hughes et al., 2003]. With the1195\ndevelopment of the remote sensing technique and the existing and forthcoming data from1196\nSuperDARN and auroral imagers, measurement of reconnection could become increasingly1197\nefficient and routine. This should allow us to address more conclusively the particularly1198\nimportant problem of the general structure of reconnection in time and space, including1199\nits temporal continuity and stability [Phan et al., 2000; Abel and Freeman, 2002], and the1200\nrelative prevalence and causes of single, dual, or multiple reconnection sites with partic-1201\nular scales, or of scale-free reconnection structure [Lazarian and Vishniac, 1999; Klimas1202\net al., 2000; Coleman et al., 2001; Chisham et al., 2002; Coleman and Freeman, 2005;1203\nPhan et al., 2006].1204\nGlossary\nAltitude-adjusted corrected geomagnetic (AACGM): A geomagnetic coordinate1205\nsystem defined to be the same as the corrected geomagnetic coordinate (CGM) system at1206\n0 km altitude.
