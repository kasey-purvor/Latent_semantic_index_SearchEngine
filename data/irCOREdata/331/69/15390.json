Lett., 33, L13502,\ndoi:10.1029\/2006GL026568.\n1. Introduction\n[2] The recent geodynamic history of Fennoscandia is\ndominated by GIA and is manifest in a broad set of\nobservables. These observations have traditionally included\nrecords of sea level change since the Last Glacial Maximum\n[Lambeck et al., 1998] and over the last century [Ekman,\n1996], and present-day anomalies in the Earth\u2019s gravita-\ntional field. More recently, these data sets have been\nextended to include estimates of ongoing 3-D crustal motion\nobtained through surveying by the Global Positioning\nSystem (GPS) [Johansson et al., 2002].\n[3] Previous analyses of Earth structure from these\nobservations have focussed, almost exclusively, on 1-D\nmodels defined by the thickness of an elastic lithosphere\nand a radial profile of mantle viscosity [e.g., Fjeldskaar and\nCathles, 1991; Mitrovica, 1996; Lambeck et al., 1998;\nDavis et al., 1999; Kaufmann and Lambeck, 2002; Milne\net al., 2001]. However, there is clear evidence for the\nexistence of significant lateral variation in Earth structure\nbeneath Fennoscandia. As an example, Bungum et al.\n[1980] used teleseismic P-wave arrivals to identify Moho\ndepths in the range 28\u201345 km across this region, while\nearly studies of Rayleigh wave dispersion data indicated\nthat the thickness of the lithosphere varies from 110 km\nbeneath the coast of Norway to 170 km in central Finland\n[Calcagnile, 1982]. Coherence studies also indicate a strong\neast-west gradient in flexural rigidity corresponding to a\nvariation in elastic thickness of approximately 80 km\n[Poudjom Djomani et al., 1999]. Moreover, global [e.g.,\nRitsema et al., 2004] and regional [Sandoval et al., 2004]\nhigh resolution body-wave tomography has also revealed\nsignificant lateral structure in the upper and lower mantle\nbeneath the Baltic shield.\n[4] A small number of studies have moved beyond 1-D\nEarth models to analyze Fennoscandian GIA. Martinec and\nWolf [2005] used a model with an axisymmetric lithospheric\nroot and ice load to analyze the so-called Fennoscandian\nrelaxation spectrum. They argued that the data set was\nconsistent with a 200 km lithosphere below central Fenno-\nscandia and 80 km at the periphery. Kaufmann et al. [2000]\nused a flat Earth model with realistic variations in litho-\nspheric thickness and asthenospheric viscosity, and con-\ncluded that such structure has significant impact on\npredictions of relative sea level changes, uplift rates and\ngravity anomalies. In an extension to this work, Kaufmann\nand Wu [2002] used synthetic data generated using the 3-D\nmodel to assess the potential impact of such structure on\ninferences of a best-fitting 1-D Earth model.\n[5] The growing recognition of the importance of 3-D\nstructure on the GIA process [e.g., Steffen and Kaufmann,\n2005] has motivated the development of numerical methods\nof increasing complexity. Indeed, numerical methods that\nallow for the incorporation of both realistic 3-D variations\nin viscoelastic Earth structure and an arbitrary ice load\nhistory have been described in the literature [e.g., Martinec,\n2000; Zhong et al., 2003; Latychev et al., 2005a] and these\nmodels have been interfaced with methods for treating a\ncomplementary, gravitationally self-consistent ocean redis-\ntribution [Wu and van der Wal, 2003; Wu et al., 2005;\nPaulson et al., 2005].\n[6] In this paper we consider the impact of 3-D variations\nin Earth structure on predictions of present-day crustal\nvelocities in Fennoscandia using the finite-volume formal-\nism described by Latychev et al. [2005a]. The study is\nmotivated by the increasingly accurate constraints on the\ndeformation field that are being obtained by the BIFROST\ncontinuous GPS network [Johansson et al., 2002].

[2002] cited errors in the horizontal\nand vertical rates as small as 0.1 mm\/yr and 0.5 mm\/yr\nrespectively. Milne et al. [2001] analyzed these rates using\n1-D Earth models and, while their best-fitting model was\nable to capture the basic elements of the regional deforma-\ntion field (see below), they noted several systematic dis-\ncrepancies. The goals of our analysis are: to assess whether\nperturbations associated with 3-D Earth structure exceed the\ncurrent observational uncertainties; to isolate sensitivities\nassociated with plate boundaries, lithospheric thickness\nvariations, and viscosity heterogeneity within both the\nupper and lower mantle; and to consider whether these\nperturbations might be mimicked by a change in the\nunderlying radial Earth model, and thus whether such\nstructure can bias 1-D inferences. More generally, our goal\nis to provide guidance to ongoing efforts to constrain GIA\nmodels using space-geodetic surveying.\n2. Results\n[7] All of the results presented here are based on the 3-D\nself-gravitating, viscoelastic Earth model outlined by\nLatychev et al. [2005a]. This formulation incorporates\nelastic compressibility, which is known to be important\nfor obtaining accurate predictions of horizontal motions\n[Mitrovica et al., 1994]. The elastic structure is prescribed\nby the seismically constrained PREM [Dziewonski and\nAnderson, 1981]. The surface mass load is comprised of a\nrealistic ice model and a complementary water load. The\nformer is constructed by combining the Fennoscandian ice\nhistory inferred by Lambeck et al. [1998] with the\nnon-Fennoscandian components of the global ICE-3G de-\nglaciation history [Tushingham and Peltier, 1991]. The\nFennoscandian ice history of Lambeck et al. [1998] was\ntuned to provide a good fit to a large suite of local sea\u2013level\ncurves, and it has been shown to yield a best\u2013 fit to\nBIFROST GPS rates [Milne et al., 2004].\n2.1. Spherically Symmetric Results\n[8] We begin by showing predictions based on a spher-\nically symmetric (i.e., 1-D) Earth model which is, within\nthis class of models, known to provide close to a best-fit to\nthe BIFROST-determined 3-D crustal velocities (Figure 1).\nThe model, our so-called radial reference Earth model (RR)\nis defined by an elastic lithosphere of thickness 120 km, an\nupper mantle viscosity of 5 \u0001 1020 Pa s, and a lower mantle\nviscosity of 5 \u0001 1021 Pa s. The radial velocity field is\ncharacterized by a zone of post-glacial uplift, with peak\nrates of 10 mm\/yr in the northern Gulf of Bothnia, near the\nBIFROST site Lulea, Sweden (red dot in Figure 1 (middle)).\nThis zone is surrounded by peripheral subsidence of several\nmm\/yr in the Norwegian Sea and northern Europe.\n[9] For this particular Earth model, the horizontal\nmotions have a general southeast to northwest trend, with\nrates exceeding 2 mm\/yr in Norway (Figure 1 (middle)).\nThe trend is a consequence of deformation toward Canada\ndriven by deglaciation of the Laurentian ice sheet. This \u2018far-\nfield\u2019 effect can be removed by plotting the horizontal\nmotions relative to the prediction at Lulea (Figure 1\n(bottom)), to leave a characteristic divergent (from\nthe center of rebound) pattern that has been described\nelsewhere [James and Lambert, 1993; Mitrovica et al.,\n1994]. Mitrovica et al. [1994] showed that horizontal\nmotions over Fennoscandia driven by Laurentian deglacia-\ntion become significantly more pronounced as the\nlower mantle viscosity is increased from \u00021021 Pa s to\n5 \u0001 1021 Pa s, and this explains the \u2018far-field contamination\u2019\nevident in moving from the Figure 1 (bottom) to Figure 1\n(middle) (see James [1991] for a discussion of the physics of\nGIA-induced horizontal motions). Conversely, the contam-\nination is sufficiently small for models with lower mantle\nviscosity of \u00021021 Pa s, that the total prediction (not simply\nrelative to Lulea) has the general pattern evident in Figure 1\n(bottom). In subsequent discussions we will show both total\nand relative-to-Lulea horizontal motions in order to discrim-\ninate between local and far-field effects. (Of course, this\nseparation is not perfect, since all such plots will by\ndefinition show zero horizontal motion at Lulea, and the\nLulea prediction may not represent the \u2018mean\u2019 far-field effect\nover Fennoscandia associated with Laurentian unloading.)\n2.2. 3-D Earth Models\n[10] Our 3-D Earth models incorporate global perturba-\ntions to both the lithospheric thickness and the mantle\nviscosity. The former, plotted over Europe and the northeast\nAtlantic, is shown in Figure 2 (left). The lithospheric\nthickness variation is derived from estimates of elastic\nFigure 1. (top) GIA-induced present-day radial and\n(middle) tangential crustal velocities predicted using the\nradial reference model RR defined in the text. (bottom) The\ntangential velocities relative to the site Lulea, Sweden,\nthe location of which is given by the red dot in Figure 1\n(middle).\nL13502 WHITEHOUSE ET AL.: 3-D EARTH STRUCTURE AND FENNOSCANDIAN GIA L13502\n2 of 5\nthickness presented in the global study of Watts [2001] and\nthe regional analysis of Pe\u00b4rez-Gussinye\u00b4 et al. [2004]. The\nprinciple inference for Fennoscandian structure is a steep\nincrease in thickness across the Gulf of Bothnia and\nsouthern Finland. The 3-D model which includes lateral\nstructure in the lithosphere only will be denoted model LT\n(the global mean lithospheric thickness of model LT is tuned\nto the value of the radial reference model RR, 120 km). A\nsecond aspect of lithospheric structure is explored by model\nPB, which is defined by plate boundary weak zones (Figure 2\n(left), white lines) superimposed on the reference model RR.\nFollowing Latychev et al. [2005b], these zones are con-\nstructed by introducing a 200 km wide region of low (2 \u0001\n1020 Pa s) viscosity into the lithosphere structure.\n[11] The 3-D mantle viscosity field is ultimately derived\nfrom a global seismic shear wave velocity model [Ritsema\net al., 2004] using the approach discussed in detail by\nLatychev et al. [2005a]. The viscosity field is generated\nfrom this model in a sequence of steps: first, a velocity-to-\ndensity scaling is applied; second, the density perturbation\nis converted to a temperature variation using a coefficient of\nthermal expansion; third, a simple exponential dependence\nis assumed to map temperature variations into viscosity\nvariations. Finally, a radially dependent scaling is applied to\nthis viscosity field to ensure that the global, depth-depen-\ndent logarithmic mean of the 3-D viscosity field is identical\nto model RR. Figure 2 (right) shows a vertical cross-section\nthrough the viscosity field along a great circle profile from\ngeographic points A-B (see Figure 2 (left)). This plot shows\na high viscosity root structure underlying the Fennoscandian\nlithosphere and, at greater depths, lateral variations which\nreach \u00023 and \u00025 orders of magnitude in the upper and\nlower mantle, respectively. We define two different 3-D\nmodels on the basis of this field; UM and LM denote\nmodels which incorporate viscosity variations only within\nthe upper and lower mantle, respectively.\n[12] Figure 3 (top) shows results generated by combining\nall aspects of the 3-D Earth models LT, PB, UM and LM (i.e.,\nlithospheric thickness and whole mantle viscosity variations,\nas well as plate boundaries; hereinafter referred to as model\nFL). The predictions are shown relative to the results for the\nreference model RR, and thus represent perturbations asso-\nciated with 3-D structure. The peak radial and tangential rate\nperturbations exceed 3 mm\/yr and 1 mm\/yr respectively over\nFennoscandia, these are nearly an order of magnitude greater\nthan the BIFROST uncertainty as of 2002 [Johansson et al.,\n2002].We conclude that 3-D structure must be included in the\nGIA analysis of the space-geodetic data set.\n[13] We have performed a suite of predictions based on\nspherically symmetric Earth models with two\u2013layer (upper\nmantle, lower mantle) viscosity profiles to determine whether\nthe perturbation FL-RR may be mimicked by a revision to\nthe 1-D Earth model RR. We found that the best two\u2013layer\nmodel yielded fits to the 3-D predictions FL that were\ncomparable to two other multi\u2013 layer (but 1-D) viscosity\nprofiles considered. The first was the 1-D model generated\nby taking the arithmetic mean of lithospheric structure and\nthe logarithmic mean of mantle structure within the geo-\ngraphic region defined by the rectangular domain shown in\nFigure 2. We denote this model RR2. The second was a\nmodel derived from a least\u2013squares inversion of the FL\npredictions for a 1-D (multi\u2013layer) viscosity profile. As an\nexample of these results, the perturbation FL-RR2 is shown\non Figure 3 (bottom), where we note that the amplitude of\nthe discrepancy is reduced by a factor of two relative to\nFigure 3 (top). The discrepancies still exceed the uncertain-\nties cited by Johansson et al. [2002] by a factor of 5 and\nthus we conclude that no 1-D Earth model is able to mimic\nthe 3-D predictions FL to within the error associated with\nthe BIFROST determined rates.\n[14] These results have important implications for efforts\nto constrain models of Fennoscandian deglaciation history\nFigure 2.

Assuming a\nconstant lithospheric thickness of 120 km, the variations are shown for a vertical cross-section extending from 120 km\ndepth to the base of the mantle (the dashed line shows the discontinuity at 670 km depth that defines the boundary between\nthe upper and lower mantle) and oriented along a profile extending from points A to B in Figure 2 (left).\nL13502 WHITEHOUSE ET AL.: 3-D EARTH STRUCTURE AND FENNOSCANDIAN GIA L13502\n3 of 5\nusing GPS data. Consider, for example, discrepancies in the\nvertical rates associated with lateral structure. As indicated\nin Figure 3 (left), regardless of the 1-D viscosity model\nemployed, there will remain a significant residual signal.\nTherefore, the only way to fit the GPS data with a 1-D\nmodel would be by varying the ice history. The specific bias\nincurred will depend on the lithospheric thickness and\nviscosity structure adopted in the 1-D model. For example,\napplication of the model RR2 would result in an ice model\nwith ice thicknesses that are underestimated in the Gulf of\nBothnia and northern Finland and overestimated within\nmost of Norway and southeast of Finland.\nFigure 3.

(right) The results of Figure 4 (middle) relative to the result for Lulea, Sweden (see Figure 1).\nL13502 WHITEHOUSE ET AL.: 3-D EARTH STRUCTURE AND FENNOSCANDIAN GIA L13502\n4 of 5\n[15] Next we have performed 3-D predictions based on\nthe individual models LT, PB, UM and LM in order to\nexplore the origin of the \u2018total\u2019 discrepancies evident in\nFigure 3. These results are shown in Figure 4 relative to the\nreference model RR.\n[16] With regard to the radial component of the predic-\ntions (Figure 4 (left)), contributions from models LT and\nUM are highly correlated and dominate the discrepancies\nassociated with the model FL (Figure 3 (top left)). The\nsignal associated with lower mantle heterogeneity displays a\ndifferent pattern, with longer wavelength structure and\nsmaller amplitude. Plate boundary effects are close to zero\nand lie within the observational uncertainty.\n[17] The influence of plate boundaries on horizontal\nmotions is more significant (middle column), with a south-\nwest to northeast gradient across Fennoscandia evident in\nthe differential rates (right column). The relative-to-Lulea\nsignals associated with lithospheric thickness variations and\nupper mantle viscosity heterogeneity are correlated and they\ndominate the \u2018total\u2019 signal derived using model FL (Figure 3\n(top right)). The influence of structure in the lower mantle\nis, once again, distinct from the other effects, with a\nnorthward trending perturbation that rotates to northwest\nin the southwestern sector of Fennoscandia. In any event,\neach of the four components of 3-D Earth structure yield\nsignals that exceed the observational uncertainty for hori-\nzontal motion.\n[18] The results in Figures 3 and 4 indicate that both far-\nfield and near-field lateral structure contribute significantly\nto the predicted Fennoscandian velocity field. The far-field\nstructure appears to be more significant when predicting\nhorizontal motions. The distinct sensitivity of the predic-\ntions to lower mantle structure suggests that it might be\npossible to infer such structure given suitably accurate\nobservations; although inferences of this kind will have to\naccount for uncertainties in the regional ice history. In\ncontrast, the signals associated with lateral variations in\nthe lithosphere and upper mantle are well correlated, and\nthus the structure in these two layers will likely not be\nseparable using GPS data alone.\n[19] Acknowledgments.
