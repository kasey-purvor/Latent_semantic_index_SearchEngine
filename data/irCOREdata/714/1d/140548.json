Lab-scale experiments with a \nchemostat found a strong correlation between ammonia shock loads and both the \nconcentration of N2O and the rate of increase of N2O in the exhaust gas for shock loads \nless than 1.6 mg NH3-N l-1 g TSS-1. For ammonia shock loads greater that 1.6 mg NH3-\nN l-1 g TSS-1 correlation was found between buildup of nitrite in the aeration tank and \nthe concentration of N2O in the exhaust gas from the tank. When subjecting the \nexperimental set up to aeration failure a similar pattern was seen with a correlation \nbetween nitrite build up in the aeration tank and concentration increase of N2O in the \nexhaust gas. The results from this work suggest the concentration and the changes in the \nconcentration of N2O in the exhaust gas from a nitrifying process may be a useful \nparameter for monitoring such processes. \n \nKeywords: aeration control, dinitrogen oxide, nitrification, nitrous oxide, process \nmonitoring \n \n3 \nINTRODUCTION \n \nRemoval of organic matter together with ammoniacal nitrogen from municipal and \nindustrial wastewater is required by law, prior to discharge [6]. Biological removal of \nammonia, nitrification, is traditionally defined as the aerobic oxidation of NH3+ to NO3- \nvia nitrite (NO2-). This is mainly carried out by two groups of autotrophic bacteria; \nammonia oxidisers (NH3aNO2-), exemplified by the genera Nitrosococcus and \nNitrosomonas, and nitrite oxidisers (NO2-aNO3-), such as Nitrobacter and Nitrospira \nspp. [10,11].  \nThe nitrification process is a sensitive process, which can suffer chemical \ninhibition as well as high ammonia concentrations resulting in decreased or ceased \nammonia oxidation [3,16]. In the wastewater treatment industry, inhibition of the \nnitrification process is often seen at works receiving high strength industrial wastewater \nwhich can result in the discharged effluent not meeting the required ammonia consents. \nMonitoring of the nitrification process during wastewater treatment is mainly done by \nanalysing spot tests of the effluent from a process using wet chemistry [1]. This method \nof monitoring is resource and time consuming and does not allow for early warning of \nprocess failure. More recently, some treatments works have experimented with \ninstalling biological nitrification toxicity monitors in side streams [9]. This does allow \nfor early warning but such monitors are expensive to install, costly to run, time \nconsuming and often unreliable due to sensor fouling and the need for recalibration [5]. \nRecently it has been shown that bacteria normally associated with the nitrification \nprocess are able to produce nitrogen oxide (NO) and dinitrogen oxide (N2O) under oxic \nconditions [13,20]. These processes have been described as aerobic denitrification. \nBuild-up of NO2- during nitrification is a sign that the nitrification process is failing, as \n4 \nNO2- has been shown to be a strong inhibitor of ammonia oxidation through its action \non ammonia mono-oxygenase [24], and its accumulation indicates that nitrite oxidisers \nare also overloaded. A number of studies have shown that the accumulation of NO2- is \noften seen in nitrifying cultures producing N2O and NO [12,22,25]. This suggests that \nN2O in the exhaust gas from a nitrification process could be a useful indicator for \nmonitoring the nitrification process on an industrial scale. Further, Garrido et al. [7] \nhave shown a relationship between N2O production and denitrification inhibition in an \nanoxic filter. The emergence of N2O and NO2- in the aeration stage of an activated \nsludge system should precede the appearance of ammonia in the final effluent by \napproximately one hydraulic retention time of the entire aeration and clarification \nsystem.  The aim of this study was to establish if the presence of N2O in the exhaust gas \nfrom a nitrification process had potential as a way in which to predict and avoid \noperational failure.  \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nExperimental \nA laboratory scale activated sludge pilot plant consisting of a completely mixed \naeration tank (7 l) and a settling tank (1 l) was employed (Figure 1). Continuous pH, \ntemperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were monitored using an online \ncomputer. The temperature was maintained at 25\u00baC by keeping the aeration tank in a \nheated water bath and DO was maintained at 5.0-5.5 mg O2 l- by regulating the air flow. \nA pH of 7.2 was maintained by means of a feedback from the online computer using \nsodium bicarbonate (1.0 M) as the buffer. The influent to the activated sludge pilot plant \nwas a synthetic non-nitrified secondary effluent, which was prepared as a solid free \n5 \nbasal medium feed developed and described in detail by Hanaki et al. [8]. All chemicals \nused were of AnalarR grade. Glucose of 160 mg.l-1 COD was added as organic matter. \nAmmonia bicarbonate was the sole source of ammonia and also acted as an alkaline \nbuffer. This gave a steady state nitrogen loading of 244 (\u00b115) and 184 (\u00b112) mg NH3-\nN.g TSS-1. For the shock loading experiments, the ammonia concentration was 701 \n(\u00b139) mg NH3-N l-1, the flow rate of the influent was maintained at 2.25 (\u00b10.04) l d-1 \n(HTR = 3.1 days) and the solids concentration of the mixed liquor was 1.0 (\u00b10.05) mg \nTSS l-1 and the SRT was maintained at 23 days by adjusting the solids recycle rate from \nthe settling tank by adjusting the solids recycle rate from the settling tank. For the \naeration failure experiment the ammonia concentration was 1100 (\u00b152) mg NH3-N l-1, \nthe flow rate of the influent was maintained at 1.48 (\u00b10.03) l d-1 (HTR = 4.7 days) and \nthe solids concentration was 1.27 (\u00b10.05) mg TSS l-1 and the SRT was maintained at 23 \ndays by adjusting the solids recycle rate from the settling tank.  \n \nInoculation and start-up. \nThe nitrifying culture used for inoculation of the aeration tank was kindly \nprovided by Engineered Biological Services (EBS, Berkshire, U.K.). The concentration \nof nitrifiers in the aeration tank after inoculation was approximately 1.5 g TSS l-1, \nhowever, after start-up when the system had reached steady state the concentration of \nnitrifiers had settled at 1.0 and 1.72 mg TSS l-1 for the shock loading experiments and \naeration failure experiment respectively. During start-up the initial feed flow rate was \napproximately 1 l d-1. The effluent from the aeration tank was analysed daily for the \npresent of ammonia and nitrite rate. If ammonia or nitrite was present in concentration \nabove 1 mg l-1 the feed flow rate was not increased and effluent was analysed again 24 \nhours later. If the concentration of ammonia and nitrite was below 1 mg l-1 the feed flow \n6 \nrate was increased by approximately 150 ml d-1. This procedure was repeated until the a \nflow rate of 2.25 (\u00b10.04) l d-1 or 1.48 l d-1 was reached. It took approximately two \nweeks to reach steady state. Between each shock loading or oxygen lowering \nexperiment the activated sludge pilot plant was allowed 3-4 days to regain steady state \nbefore another was carried out. \n \nAnalytical Methods \nTotal suspended solids (TSS) of the nitrifying biomass, NH3-N, NO2--N and NO3--\nN was analysed according to standard methods [1]. An infrared gas analyser (VIA-510, \nHoriba UK, Northampton) fitted with a sampler unit and mist trap (ES-C510SS, Horiba \nUK, Northampton) was used for online determination of N2O concentrations (ppmv) in \nthe exhaust gas from the aeration tank. The N2O analyser was calibrated using primary \ngrade nitrogen gas (99.99% N2, Air products, UK) for zero calibration and 160 ppmv \nN2O in nitrogen gas (Air products, UK) for end point calibration. The volume of \nexhaust gas from the aeration tank was determined by sealing the tank and measure the \nflow using a bubble flow meter. The total amount of N2O in the exhaust gas and the rate \nof appearance was calculated from the concentration and exhaust data using a \nspreadsheet. \n \nRESULTS \n \nIn order to determine if the presence of N2O in the exhaust gas from a nitrification \nprocess could be used as an indicator for monitoring the nitrification process, several \nexperiments were carried out in which the activated sludge plant was either shock \nloaded with increasing amounts of ammonia (0.53 - 3.3 mg.g TSS-1 as NH3-N) or was \n7 \nsubjected to aeration failure. The effect of ammonia shock loading and aeration failure \non the presence of N2O in the exhaust gas was monitored together with build up of \nammonia and nitrite in the aeration tank. \n \nAmmonia shock loading. \nThe nitrification process was shock loaded by adding 5 to 25 ml of feed directly in \nthe aeration tank of the activated sludge plant running at the conditions stated \npreviously (Figure 1.). This gave a shock loading in the range of 0.53 - 3.30 mg.g TSS-1 \nas NH3-N. The air supply was kept constant during an experiment at 1.53 (\u00b10.03 l) \nwhich gave a start DO of 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 mg O2 l-1. DO and pH in the aeration tank was \nlogged once a minute whereas the concentration of N2O in the exhaust gas logged every \n30 seconds during an experiment. The nitrifying culture in the aeration tank was \nsampled at 1-4 minutes intervals during an experiment and ammonia, nitrite and nitrate \nconcentrations was determined. \nThe pH in the aeration tank was between 7.2-7.5 during all the experiments. \nShock loading the nitrifiers with ammonia was always followed by a decrease of DO in \nthe aeration tank and an increase in the concentration of N2O in the exhaust gas from \nthe aeration tank (Figure 2). The extent of decrease in the DO and increase in N2O was \ndependant on the size of the shock load, with N2O being produced at oxygen \nconcentrations between 1-4 mg O2 l-1. When shock loading the system with 1.6 mg \nNH3-N g TSS-1 (Figure 2) a minimum for the DO and a maximum N2O concentration \nwas reached approximately 8 minutes after addition of the shock load, after which the \nDO started to increase and the N2O concentration to decrease. Approximately 40 \nminutes after applying the shock load both the DO in the aeration tank and N2O \nconcentration in the exhaust gas had recovered.  \n8 \nThe obtained data for N2O concentrations in the exhaust gas was used to calculate \nthe total amount of N2O in the exhaust gas (N2OTOT), the rate at which N2O increased in \nthe exhaust gas (rN2O) and yield of N2O (YN2O) expressed as the percentages of NH3-N \nadded during the experiment (via feed and shock load) converted into N2O in the \nexhaust gas (Table 1). In Table 1 the relationship between ammonia shock load and the \nabove calculated parameters is shown together with the maximum concentration of N2O \n(N2OMAX) determined in the exhaust gas during an experiment. The calculated values \nfor N2OTOT, rN2O, YN2O, and N2OMAX all increased with increasing level of shock load \n(Table 1). Correlation analysis showed that strong linear correlation was found between \nammonia shock loads up till 1.6 mg NH3-N g TSS-1 and N2OMAX (r2=0.98), N2OTOT \n(r2=0.96) and rN2O (r2=0.95) whereas the r2 for the correlation with YN2O was only 0.87. \nFigure 3 shows the change of N2OMAX and rN2O with increasing ammonia shock loads. \nThe increases in rN2O and N2OMAX were linear for ammonia shock loads until 1.6 mg \nNH3-N g TSS-1 after which the relationship appears to reach saturation. \nAccumulation of nitrite was observed for shock loads above 1.03 mg NH3-N g \nTSS-1, with the amount increasing for increasing shock load. Figure 4 shows the \nconcentration of N2O in the exhaust gas and nitrite in the aeration tank after shock \nloading with 1.6 and 3.3 mg NH3-N g TSS-1. At high levels of shock loading, at which \nrN2O and N2OMAX had reach saturation, the accumulation of nitrite followed a similar \nprofile to the concentration of N2O in the exhaust gas (r2 = 0.86), and the maximum \nconcentration of nitrite determined in the aeration tank was 2.5 mg NO2--N l-1. By \ncontrast, at shock loads less than 1.6 mg NH3-N g TSS-1 only small amounts of nitrite \naccumulated (>0.6 mg NO2--N l-1). \n \n \n9 \nAeration failure \nThe aeration of the nitrifying activated sludge pilot plant was lowered from 3.7 to \n0.3 l min-1 and the concentration of NO2- and DO in the aeration tank and N2O in the \nexhaust gas was recorded. DO and pH in the aeration tank were logged once a minute \nand the concentration of N2O in the exhaust gas was logged every 30 seconds during an \nexperiment. The nitrifying culture in the aeration tank was sampled at 1-4 minutes \nintervals during an experiment and ammonia, nitrite and nitrate concentrations were \ndetermined. \nFigure 5a shows the decrease in DO concentration in the aeration tank after \nturning down the aeration. When the DO reached a concentration of less than 1 mg O2 l-\n1, N2O started to appear in the exhaust gas and NO2- started to accumulate in the \naeration tank. It can be observed that the profile for NO2- accumulation in the aeration \ntank follows the profile for N2O concentration in the exhaust gas, with the concentration \nincreasing with time. Correlation analysis again showed that a strong linear correlation \nwas found between the concentration increase of NO2- in the aeration tank and N2O in \nthe exhaust gas ( r2 = 0.99). After 53 minutes the aeration was returned to 3.7 l min-1 \n(Figure 5b). After the aeration was increased, the concentration of N2O in the exhaust \ngas decreased rapidly, whereas it took another 20 minutes for the concentration of NO2- \nin the aeration tank to decrease. At the same time the DO concentration started to \nincrease, however, a small decrease was observed between 65-72 minutes where the \nNO2- concentration reached its maximum (Figure 5b). After approximately 90 minutes \nfrom the start of the experiment the DO, N2O and NO2- concentration had recovered to \npre-experimental values.  \n \n \n10 \nDISCUSSION \n \nA laboratory scale activated sludge plant inoculated with a mixed culture of nitrifying \nbacteria was used to study the production of N2O during ammonia shock loading and \naeration failure. The results from the ammonia shock loading experiment showed that \nN2O was produced during shock loading with ammonia at oxygen concentrations as \nhigh as 4 mg O2 l-1. Both the rate at which the N2O concentration increased in the \nexhaust gas and the maximum concentration observed in the exhaust gas were found to \ncorrelate to the size of the ammonia shock load (for ammonia shock loads less than 1.6 \nmg NH3-N g TSS-1). However, with ammonia shock loads greater than 1.6 mg NH3-N g \nTSS-1, both the maximum and the rate of increase of N2O in the exhaust gas appeared to \nreach saturation, which indicated that the N2O production by the nitrifiers had reached \nits maximum. This may have been due either to DO reaching zero or to the oxidation \nrate of the ammonia reaching its maximum at this concentration. Similar results were \nreported by Nogita et al. [15] and Satio et al. [21], who found that the rate of N2O \nproduction by activated sludge receiving municipal wastewater was related to both the \nCOD and nitrogen loading. However, they did not observe the rates reaching a \nmaximum.  \nPrevious authors have reported that ammonia-oxidising bacteria under both \noxygen-limiting and oxygen-free conditions reduce NO2- formed from ammonia \noxidation to N2O and further to N2 [22]. The increase in N2O is an effect of the decrease \nin DO causing the bacteria to use NO2- as the terminal electron acceptor. Other studies \nhave shown that the principal mechanisms for N2O production by ammonia oxidisers is \nsimultaneous reduction of ammonia and oxidation of nitrite, also causing nitrite to be \nused as the terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen [2, 4, 18, 19]. The large \n11 \namounts of nitrite accumulated when shock loads were above 1.6 mg NH3-N g TSS-1, \n(Figure 4a,b) could be explained by the fact that the rate at which N2O increased in the \nexhaust gas had reached its maximum and nitrite was produced in excess. However, it \ncould also be due to the nitrite oxidising bacteria not being able to oxidise the produced \nnitrite fast enough, due to lack of oxygen. Studies by Laanbroek and Gerards [14] have \nsuggested that the ability of ammonia oxidisers to substitute oxygen with nitrite as the \nterminal electron acceptor at low oxygen concentrations gives them a competitive edge \nover nitrite oxidisers at low oxygen concentrations \nThe response to aeration failure (oxygen lowering experiment) was similar to that \nof high level shock loading, with decreasing DO in the aeration tank and simultaneous \nincreases in N2O concentration in the exhaust gas and increased nitrite in the aeration \ntank (Figure 5a). However during this experiment the presence of N2O first occurred at \nDO concentrations under 1 mg O2 l-1. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \nTwo sets of experiments were conducted on a laboratory scale activated sludge pilot \nplant inoculated with a mixed nitrifying bacterial culture and fed a synthetic non-\nnitrified secondary effluent in order to determine whether N2O detected in the exhaust \ngas could be used for monitoring the nitrification process. During one set of \nexperiments the effect of ammonia shock loading and was investigated and the \nfollowing was found: \n \n12 \n\u2022 The concentration of N2O in the exhaust gas from the nitrifying activated sludge \npilot plant and the rate at which it increases were correlated to the size of the ammonia \nshock load for shock loads less than 1.6 mg NH3-N g TSS-1. \n\u2022 For ammonia shock loads greater than 1.6 mg NH3-N g TSS-1, the concentration of \nN2O in the exhaust gas was related to the build-up of nitrite in the aeration tank \n\u2022 During aeration failure the increase of N2O in the exhaust gas was closely related to \nthe build up of nitrite in the aeration tank. \n \nFrom this study it can be concluded that both the concentration and the rate of increase \nof N2O may be good indicators for monitoring the nitrification process, as they are \ncorrelated to both ammonia shock load and the build-up of nitrite in the aeration tank. If \nthe emergence of N2O in the exhaust gas of the first stage of a nitrification process \nprecedes the appearance of ammonia in the final effluent by approximately one \nhydraulic retention time, as expected, these results illustrate the potential of monitoring \nN2O for predicting operational failure and providing an opportunity to take remedial \naction. Further work in which the impacts of ammonia shock loads, aeration reduction \nand toxic shocks on the nitrogen balance of a two-stage activated sludge system should \nbe carried out and the time frame available for remedial action after an N2O increase is \nrecorded should be determined. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe authors would like to thank the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil for financial support of this work. \n \n13 \n \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
