This paper argues that a key mechanism through \nwhich health affects growth is via total factor productivity (TFP). We \nfirst estimate TFP based on a production function and then estimate \nthe determinants of TFP, paying particular attention to three \nindicators of health that are particularly problematic in developing \nregions: malnutrition, malaria and waterborne diseases. We find the \nimpact of poor health on TFP to be negative, significant, and robust \nacross a wide variety of specifications.  \n \nJEL classification:  O47, I12 \nKeywords: Total factor productivity, disease, health, underdevelopment  \n \n 4 \nI. Introduction \n \nDisease and poor health represent a great burden to affected individuals. Whilst \ndifficult to quantify, the welfare losses to the individual of being severely ill can be \nsignificant, particularly in those developing regions with limited social security \nprovision and health care. Individuals suffering from illness may be weak, unable to \nwork or study and generally unable to provide for children and other dependants. At a \nmore aggregated level, however, it seems likely that a high disease burden may have \nan adverse impact on a country's productivity, growth and, ultimately, economic \ndevelopment. The many studies that have attempted to explain cross-country \ndifferences in economic growth and productivity rates have typically suggested that \neducation, trade openness, savings, inflation and the initial level of income are \namongst the key explanatory variables (Barro, 1991; Mankiw et al., 1992; Barro and \nSala-i-Martin, 1995; Miller and Upadhyay, 2000). There are good reasons to suggest, \nhowever, that health is also an important determinant. Lvovsky (2001), for instance, \nestimates that the burden of disease in LDCs, expressed in disability-adjusted life \nyears (DALYs) lost per million people, is approximately twice that in developed \ncountries.1 This results from the far higher incidence of disease and malnutrition in \nLDCs compared to developed regions. Whilst the burden of disease may be a function \nof poverty, a high disease burden is also likely to adversely affect a nation's \ndevelopment prospects.  \n \nComparatively little attention, however, had been paid in the past to the impact of \npoor health, particularly in less developed countries (LDCs), on growth and \nproductivity. These issues have begun to be addressed by more recent studies. The \n 5 \nexisting literature includes Wheeler (1980), Knowles and Owen (1995, 1997), \nMcCarthy et al. (2000), Gallup and Sachs (2000), Bhargava et al. (2001), Arcand \n(2001), Mayer (2001), McDonald and Roberts (2002) and Webber (2002).2 Our paper \ndiffers in two main and significant aspects from this literature. First, whilst existing \nstudies mostly focus on life expectancy as a single aggregate measure of health, which \nonly captures mortality, we look at three distinct and specific factors affecting health. \nThese are malaria, malnutrition and waterborne diseases, all of which affect both \nmorbidity and mortality and arguably morbidity in particular.3 These measures \ncapture three of the most serious threats to health in developing regions, another being \nthe HIV\/AIDS epidemic which remains a topic for future work. Second, the existing \nliterature, for example, Wheeler (1980) and Knowles and Owen (1997) studies the \neffect of health on cross-national variation in income levels or economic growth. \nArcand (2001) who looks at malnutrition and McCarthy et al. (2000) and Gallup and \nSachs (2000) who look at malaria also estimate the effect of poor health on economic \ngrowth rates. Instead, we directly estimate the effect of health on total factor \nproductivity. \n \nIf a disease has a fatal effect on individuals then it will lower the amount of labour \nsupplied. However, in the vast majority of cases, the very common diseases and \nillnesses in the developing world such as undernourishment, malaria and waterborne \ndiseases have non-fatal consequences, particularly on adults who participate in the \nlabour force. Affected individuals remain in the labour force, but their productivity is \nseverely impaired. Infectious diseases such as malaria, for instance, result in recurrent \ndebilitating bouts of illness, which prevents individuals from supplying their labour \nproductively. Human capital accumulation may also be adversely affected by poor \n 6 \nhealth due to the higher levels of school absenteeism amongst those suffering from \nillness. However, as we shall argue in the next section, the economic impact of poor \nhealth is not restricted to a reduction in the productivity of labour. A high disease \nburden within a country can also have implications for foreign and domestic \ninvestment, tourism, the internal mobility of labour and land use. As the WHO (2001) \nclaims, returns to investment in agriculture, mining, manufacturing and tourism, as \nwell as investment in major infrastructure projects, are likely to be depressed by a \nhigh incidence of illness and disease.  \n \nOur central argument is therefore that poor health affects economic development \nprimarily via total factor productivity, not as an additional factor of production or by \naffecting the productivity of one other factor of production only. If so, then including \nhealth as a direct determinant of growth is conceptually inaccurate since health is \nlikely to affect output growth indirectly via total factor productivity. As far as we are \naware, however, no study has directly examined the impact of poor health on cross-\ncountry aggregate productivity levels. That is the contribution of the present paper. \nWe begin by estimating total factor productivity (TFP) from a parsimonious \nproduction function specification. We then examine the determinants of TFP paying \nparticular attention to three key indicators of poor health in LDCs - the proportion of \nundernourished within a country, the incidence of malaria and the incidence of \nwaterborne diseases. We examine a variety of functional forms and control for the \npotential endogeneity of poor health. \n \nThe paper is organized as follows; Section II begins by outlining the links between \npoor health and productivity; Section III examines the methodology used to estimate \n 7 \nTFP; Section IV discusses and estimates the determinants of TFP and Section V \nconcludes. \n \nII. Poor Health, Growth and Productivity \n \nIt is notable that the populations of many of the poorest countries in the world also \nsuffer from the greatest degree of poor health. Murray and Lopez (1996: 259) estimate \nthe per capita disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost in various regions of the \nworld in 1990 due to premature mortality and years lived with disability, adjusted for \nseverity. The estimated figures are lowest in developed countries at about 0.17 \nDALYs per capita, they range from 0.2 to 0.4 DALYs per capita in various regions of \nthe developing world, and reach close to 0.6 DALYs per capita in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica. \n \nAs Table 1 indicates, some of the world\u2019s lowest life expectancies, in many cases less \nthan 50 years, are experienced in those sub-Saharan African countries that typically \nalso suffer from extremely low levels of per capita income and often negative \neconomic growth rates.4 Although underdeveloped countries often lack the resources \nneeded to invest in health care systems, it also seems likely that poor health will itself \nretard growth and hence income. Developing countries would therefore appear to be \nin a vicious cycle resulting in persistent underdevelopment. \n \n 8 \nTable 1.

(2001), Bloom et al. (1999) and Gallup et al. (1999) find life \nexpectancy at birth to be a positive and significant determinant of economic growth \nrates. Typically, it has been suggested that a 10% increase in life expectancy is \nassociated with a rise in economic growth of 0.3-0.4% per year (WHO, 2001). One of \nthe problems with such estimations is that life expectancy is a measure of mortality \nrather than morbidity or poor health. Whilst the two are obviously correlated, it is \nmorbidity and poor health rather than mortality which should have the greatest impact \non economic development.  \n \nFurthermore, we contend that the most important mechanism by which poor health is \nlikely to affect economic growth is via its impact on the productivity of inputs. In \norder to examine this mechanism we have to clarify what is meant by poor health. \nHealth, by its very nature, is multidimensional and, as a result, is difficult to quantify. \nFor the purposes of this paper we have focussed on some of the greatest threats to \nhealth facing the developing world: undernourishment (or malnutrition), malaria and \n 9 \nwaterborne diseases. Murray and Lopez (1996: 312) estimate that malnutrition is \nresponsible for 18 per cent of the total burden of disease in developing countries (32.7 \nper cent in Sub-Saharan Africa). Lvovsky (2001: 6) suggests that safe water supply \nand sanitation account for another 7 per cent and malaria accounts for 3 per cent of \nthe burden of disease in developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, these figures \nrise to 10 per cent for access to safe water and sanitation and 9 per cent for malaria.  \n \nWe now examine the implications of our three indicators of health for growth and \nproductivity. \n \n(i) Undernourishment  \n \nUndernourishment remains widespread in the developing regions. In 1997, in the \ndeveloping world as a whole, over 880 million people were classed as being \nundernourished, equivalent to 18% of the developing world\u2019s population. In sub-\nSaharan Africa, 34% were classed as undernourished, although this figure was over \n60% for individual countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and \nBurundi. Although the proportion of undernourished is falling in most developing \nregions, in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, the absolute \nnumber of undernourished is actually rising.5 \n \nArcand (2001) estimates what he calls the efficiency cost of hunger: the growth-\nretarding effect due to undernourishment. Across a wide specification of models he \nfinds that undernourishment has a statistically significant and substantively important \nnegative impact on growth rates. His findings suggest that an elimination of \n 10 \nundernourishment in Sub-Saharan African countries would raise the economic growth \nrate between 0.34 percentage points and as much as 4.63 percentage points. \n \nThe economic impact of malnutrition occurs largely through its effects on the labour \nforce. Those suffering from malnutrition often feel weak and lacking in energy and \nare more susceptible to infection and other illnesses than those who receive the \nminimum dietary energy requirements (Dasgupta 1993, Chowdhury and Chen 1977). \nFurthermore, nutrient deficiencies, particularly in childhood, can retard physical and \ncognitive development and often undermine schooling due to absenteeism and early \ndropouts. In a review of the literature examining the impact of poor nutrition on the \ndevelopment of the brain, Lewis et al. (1986) and Politt (1997, 2001) conclude that \nmost studies point to certain key nutrients, such as iron and Vitamin A, as being vital \nfor cognitive development. Similarly, in a study of Tanzanian schoolchildren, \nBhargava and Yu (1997) found that nutritional status was a significant predictor of \neducational test results. \n \nIn the light of these findings, a number of case studies have examined the impact of \npoor nutrition on labour productivity in LDCs. Wolgemuth et al. (1982), for example, \nfound an increase in calories to increase the productivity of Kenyan construction \nworkers, whilst Strauss (1986) also found a positive link between calorific intake and \nagricultural labour productivity in a study of farm households in Sierra Leone. Strauss \nand Thomas (1998) provide a thorough review of the links between nutrition, \nproductivity and wages and conclude that there does appear to be a causal relationship \nbetween health and productivity. However, by examining the impact of nutrition on \n 11 \nthe productivity of an individual, or group of individuals, the studies reviewed by \nStrauss and Thomas fail to consider the macroeconomic impact of malnutrition.  \n \nIn addition to its likely impact on aggregate labour productivity, poor health can have \nother macroeconomic implications. A country experiencing widespread malnutrition, \nor other forms of ill health, will find its national budget distorted. The increased \ndemands on the health care system will mean that resources for other social services \nwill be reduced, and perhaps donor resources that may have been used to meet other \nneeds will have to be diverted.  \n \n(ii) Malaria \n \nGallup and Sachs (2000) and McCarthy et al. (2000) have estimated the impact of \nmalaria on economic growth rates. Both papers find a significant negative relationship \nbetween malaria morbidity and economic growth rates, which proves to be robust \nacross a variety of functional forms. Gallup and Sachs, for example, estimate that the \neffect of a country having intensive malaria in 1965 was to lower its economic growth \nrate by 1.3%, having controlled for other factors. McCarthy et al. find malaria to have \na slightly smaller impact on growth, with the impact exceeding 0.25% per year for \naround one quarter of the sample. \n \nMalaria is one of the most prevalent and challenging infectious diseases affecting \ndeveloping countries. It is endemic in 91 countries, accounting for 40% of the world's \npopulation, and is responsible for over 1 million deaths per year (McCarthy et al., \n2000). Clearly such deaths will affect the supply of labour. However, in the majority \n 12 \nof cases, particularly in labour-supplying adults, malaria is non-fatal, but results in \nfrequent recurrent attacks that affect the productivity of labour supply. \n \nLike malnutrition, malaria is most common in the poorest regions of the world, \nespecially sub-Saharan Africa. However, unlike malnutrition, the incidence of malaria \nappears to be only a weak function of income. Whilst communities can, to an extent, \ninvest in antimalaria protection (such as bed nets) and also health care services to treat \nsufferers, the severity of malaria is determined mainly by climate and ecology. \nEradication programmes since the 1940s and 50s have focussed on the control of \nmosquitoes and have been successful in low-incidence regions such as the \nMediterranean, but have largely failed in high-incidence regions such as tropical sub-\nSaharan Africa. In this latter region eradication efforts were hindered by the far higher \nhuman and mosquito carrying rates, the prevalence of mosquito species particularly \nsuited to malaria transmission, and climatic conditions that allow all year around \nexposure (McCarthy et al., 2000). Large scale eradication efforts were scaled back in \nthe 1960s to be replaced by local initiatives involving both prevention and treatment. \n \nThe most direct economic impact of malaria is in terms of reduced labour \nproductivity. Hempel and Najera (1996) indicate that a bout of non-fatal malaria will \ntypically last for 10-14 days including 4-6 days of total incapacitation with the \nremainder characterized by headaches, fatigue and nausea. A mild sufferer will \nexperience 1 or 2 bouts per year. The extent to which this lost labour time will reduce \noutput depends on whether it coincides with harvest time in agricultural areas, and \nwhether other family members can compensate.6 In common with malnutrition, \nmalaria results in frequent absenteeism, particularly amongst school children, \n 13 \nresulting in the reduced accumulation of human capital and associated lost \nproductivity in adult life. However, the economic impact of malaria extends beyond \nthe direct impact on labour productivity. A high malaria burden is likely to increase \nlabour turnover resulting in increased hiring and training costs and reduced \nprofitability for enterprises. Furthermore, a high malaria incidence within a particular \narea may reduce tourism, deter otherwise profitable foreign and domestic investment \nand prevent the use of land or other natural resources (WHO, 2001). Malaria may also \nlimit the movement of workers due to the reluctance of both foreign and domestic \nlabour to move to malaria infested regions. The quality of skill matching may suffer \nas a result. With regard to the internal mobility of labour, Gallup and Sachs argue that \nthe better educated workers who often move to the largely malaria free cities are \nlikely to lose their natural protection. As a result, they may be reluctant to return to \nrural areas or even to maintain contact with such areas. Thus, \u2018the transmission of \nideas, techniques and the development of transportation systems may all be stunted by \nmalaria\u2019 (Gallup and Sachs, 1999: 10). Finally, Conly (1975) has argued that attempts \nto change planting patterns to minimize the overlap between bouts of malaria and \npeak agricultural activity have often resulted in reduced agricultural productivity. In \nsum, a high incidence of malaria may mean that resources are not allocated efficiently \nand assets are not used as productively as they could be. \n \n(iii) Waterborne diseases \n \nLack of access to sanitation and particularly to safe drinking water remains a great \nrisk to health in developing countries. It is a strong determinant of waterborne \ndiarrhoeal and other diseases such as amoebiasis, cholera, dysentery, schistosomiasis \n 14 \nand typhoid fever as well as roundworm and guinea worm infections. It is estimated \nthat diarrhoeal diseases alone (including dysentery) annually kill over 2 million \nchildren under the age of five (Warner, 1997). And yet, as with malnutrition and \nmalaria, adults often survive the effects of waterborne diseases, but their labour \nproductivity becomes severely impaired both during and after the period of disease. \nFurthermore, like malnutrition and malaria, lack of access to safe water and sanitation \nis most common in the poorest regions of the world. Indeed, it often exacerbates the \nincidence and effects of malnutrition and malaria as diarrhoeal and other diseases \nmake it more difficult for individuals to retain consumed food and poor water \nconditions foster the spread of malaria contaminated mosquitoes. \n \nDespite significant effort, access to safe water and sanitation has not considerably \nincreased over the last two or three decades. The WHO estimated that in the mid-\n1970s some 1.9 billion people had no access to safe drinking water and some 2 billion \nhad no access to adequate sanitation. Twenty years later more than 1.1 billion people \nworldwide were still deprived of access to safe water and the number of people \nwithout adequate sanitation actually rose to 2.5 billion (UN Ecosoc, 2000). This rather \npoor progress is despite a number of policy initiatives, starting with the launch of the \nInternational Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1980\u20131990), which was \ninitiated by the UN Water Conference in Mar del Plata, Argentina, in 1977. The \nextent of the health problem posed by a lack of access to safe water and sanitation \nmeant that the issue featured prominently at the September 2002 UN Conference on \nSustainable Development in Johannesburg, with the summit setting a target of \nreducing by half the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and \nsanitation by 2015. \n 15 \n \nUnlike malaria, lack of access to safe water and sanitation appears to be a strong \nfunction of income. The so-called Environmental Kuznets Curve literature shows that \nsuch access improves unambiguously with rising income (Shafik (1994)). However, \nas with the other forms of ill health, there are also likely to be a number of negative \nfeedback effects on economic development. Diarrhoeal disease, even when it is non-\nfatal as in the majority of cases with adolescents and adults, usually means that the \naffected individuals are rendered unproductive as they cannot attend either school or \nwork. The economic impact is not limited to absenteeism, however, as the weakening \neffect on body functions further reduces the long-term ability of individuals to study \nor work. In addition, other individuals such as parents or spouses are also affected as \nthey need to attend to sick individuals. In this respect, waterborne diseases are similar \nto malaria, as the affected individuals can become largely incapacitated and highly \ndependent on others. In comparison, undernourishment is a more chronic condition. \n \nIII. Estimating Total Factor Productivity \n \nIn order to examine the impact of health on productivity we require a measure of total \nfactor productivity. Although commonly estimated growth equations (Barro 1991, \nBarro and Sala-i-Martin 1995, Mankiw et al. 1992, Islam 1995) can be used to \nprovide information on aggregate productivity, their primary focus is on income \nconvergence and there is little consensus as to exactly which independent variables \nshould be included. We therefore adopt what we believe to be the most commonly \nused and widely accepted method for calculating TFP, namely the estimation of a \nCobb-Douglas production function. This is the approach used in many key \n 16 \nproductivity studies, such as Hall and Jones (1999), Bernard and Jones (1996) and \nMiller and Upadhyay (2000).  \n \nWe therefore estimate TFP from a Cobb-Douglas production function specified as \nfollows: \n \nY = A K\u03b1 H\u03b4  L\u03b2  where 0 < \u03b1 < 1, 0 <  \u03b4 < 1 and 0 < \u03b2 < 1   (1) \n \nY denotes real GDP, A represents an index of total factor productivity, K represents \nthe total physical capital stock, H represents human capital and L denotes the total \nlabour force. Note that the number of hours worked might be a better measure of the \nstock of labour, but lack of data prevents us from using it. We do not restrict (\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \n\u03b4) to equal one and hence allow for the possibility of increasing or decreasing returns \nto scale.  \n \nTo obtain equation (1) in per worker form, we divide by the labour force, L.   \n \n y = A k\u03b1 h\u03b4 L\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b4 -1        (2) \n \nwhere y represents real GDP per worker, k denotes the physical capital stock per \nworker and h denotes human capital per worker. Expressing equation (2) in natural \nlogarithms provides equation (3): \n \n lny = lnA + \u03b1lnk + \u03b4lnh + (\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b4 -1)lnL     (3) \n \n 17 \nNote that the nature of the production function\u2019s returns to scale can now be \nascertained by the coefficient on lnL. Equation (3) then leads directly to equation (4), \nour equation to be estimated: \n \nlnyit = \u03c6i + \u03b1lnkit + \u03b4lnhit + (\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b4 -1)lnLit + \u03b5it    (4) \n \nWhere subscripts i and t denote country and year, respectively. Our measure of total \nfactor productivity is then (\u03c6i + \u03b5it) which is equivalent to lnA in equation (3). \nEquation (4) is estimated for a panel of 52 developed and developing countries using \ndata at five yearly intervals for the period 1965 \u2013 1995. The time series reflects the \nfact that our source of human capital data (Barro and Lee 2000) reports only five-\nyearly observations.7 Data for y, k and L are provided by the World Bank (2004). \nMore information on all data is provided in Appendix A. Appendix B lists the \ncountries for which TFP can be estimated. Naturally, developed countries have better \ndata availability, but 32 of the 52 countries in the sample are developing countries. \nBoth fixed and random effects specifications are used to estimate equation (4). In the \nformer, \u03c6i are treated as regression parameters, whilst in the latter they are treated as \ncomponents of the random disturbance. Table 2 provides our fixed effects results. \nRandom effects results yield the same signs and very similar coefficients as the fixed \neffects results. Since the Hausman test rejects the random effects assumption at the 5 \nper cent level, we only report the latter. \n \n 18 \nTable 2.

RE) \n9.12 \n(0.03) \nStandard errors in parentheses (p-value for the Hausman test). \nNote: *** denotes significance at 99% confidence level. \n \nTable 2 provides the estimated production function described by equation (4). The \ncoefficient of lnL indicates that the production function exhibits close to constant \nreturns to scale. The elasticity of output with respect to the capital stock is 0.37, whilst \nthe equivalent elasticity for human capital is 0.20. Since the coefficient of lnL \nrepresents (\u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b4 -1), the implied elasticity of output with respect to the labour \nforce (\u03b2) is 0.44. Using the estimates from table 2 as our measure of TFP, we now \nturn towards the determinants of TFP and the role of health therein. \n \nIV. The Determinants of TFP \n \nHaving estimated TFP using the results in Table 2, we are now in a position to \nidentify the determinants of TFP, beginning with variables relating to the health of a \nnation.8 \n 19 \n \n(i) Indicators of Health \n \nSince our primary concern is the impact of poor health on TFP in LDCs, we utilize \ndata on three of the most common causes of ill health in developing regions. The first \nis undernourishment or malnutrition. Note that to capture this aspect of poor health we \ncannot use calorie, protein or fat supply data despite their quite good availability. The \nreason is that it has long been recognized that the need for calorie and protein intake \ndepends partly on climatic conditions, with people in cold countries in greater need \nthan people in warmer climates (FAO, 1974; Parker, 2000). As a consequence, for \nexample, cold Mongolia has a higher calorie and protein supply despite its great \npoverty than the much richer Singapore, located in the tropics. For this reason, we \nprefer to consider undernourishment directly. The FAO defines undernourishment as \n\u2018food intake that is insufficient to meet dietary energy requirements continuously\u2019 \nwhere dietary energy requirements are \u2018the amount of dietary energy required by an \nindividual to maintain body functions, health and normal activity.\u2019 (FAO, 2000). We \nuse the proportion of the population that is undernourished, as reported by the FAO \n(2000). Data are provided for all of our 52 countries, although only for the years 1980, \n1991 and 1996.The percentage of undernourished people is a better indicator of the \nactual health burden than the very close concept of relative food inadequacy (FAO, \n1996: 3-5) and is now the FAO\u2019s preferred indicator of the extent of \nundernourishment. We note that Svedberg (1999) has raised doubts with respect to the \nreliability and suitability of these data. He argues in favour of using anthropometric \nmeasurements referring to body height and\/or weight instead. The FAO (2002a) itself \nhas rejected Svedberg\u2019s claim as have several experts of a FAO-sponsored Technical \n 20 \nWorkshop (FAO, 2002b). Not being technical experts ourselves, we are uncertain as \nto the validity of Svedberg\u2019s claims. However, the availability of cross-country data \non anthropometric measurements is rather poor for children before the 1990s and \npractically no data exist for adults. We therefore see no alternative to using the FAO \ndata. \n \nOur second indicator is the incidence of malaria, as provided by Gallup et al. (1999) \nfor all of our 52 countries for the years 1966 and 1994. Gallup et al. used World \nHealth Organization (WHO) data to calculate the fraction of a country\u2019s land area \nsubject to malaria. They then collected WHO data on the percentage of malaria cases \nthat are the malignant falciparum species of malaria. Of the four species of malaria, \nfalciparum is the most severe, being the most resistant to drugs and responsible for \nalmost all malaria mortality. The malaria index is then the product of the percentage \nof land area and the percentage of falciparum cases.  \n \nFinally, the World Bank (2004) provides our third indicator, the percentage of the \npopulation without access to safe water.9 This variable is used as a proxy for the \nvariety of waterborne diseases that are prevalent in unclean water supplies. The World \nBank (2004) defines access to safe water \u2018as the share of the population with \nreasonable access to an adequate amount of safe water (including treated surface \nwater and untreated but uncontaminated water, such as from springs, sanitary wells, \nand protected boreholes). In urban areas the source may be a public fountain or \nstandpost located not more than 200 meters away. In rural areas the definition implies \nthat members of the household do not have to spend a disproportionate part of the day \nfetching water. An adequate amount of water is that needed to satisfy metabolic, \n 21 \nhygienic, and domestic requirements, usually about 20 litres of safe water a person \nper day.\u2019 This variable is available for our 52 countries, for the years 1970, 1975, \n1985, 1988, and 1993.  \n \n(ii) Other Determinants of TFP \n \nIn addition to our health variables, we include a number of other determinants of TFP, \nalthough relatively few have been suggested within the growth\/productivity literature. \nMiller and Upadhyay (2000) suggest a determinant of TFP in the form of trade \nopenness. Although the impact of trade on growth has generated a large, sometimes \nconflicting, volume of literature (see for example, Greenaway et al., 2002; Rodriguez \nand Rodrik, 1999; Harrison, 1996), it is widely accepted that increased openness is \nlikely to result in countries deepening their specialization in those sectors in which \nthey enjoy a comparative advantage. The resultant efficiency gains are likely to \nmanifest themselves in the form of increased TFP which, in turn, should raise growth \nrates. Miller and Upadhyay\u2019s (2000) findings would support this assertion. Our \npreferred measure of trade openness is the share of trade in GNP, although our results \nare insensitive to the use of the share of exports in GNP. Both of these variables are \nprovided by the World Bank (2004).  \n \nIt has often been argued that productivity growth in the agricultural sector is lower \nthan that in the manufacturing sector, an assumption often implicit in the works of \ndevelopment economists such as Lewis and Prebisch (e.g. Lewis, 1954; Prebisch, \n1984). Although more recent studies have challenged this assertion (Martin and Mitra, \n1999), we include the share of agricultural value added in total GNP to assess whether \n 22 \nagrarian economies have lower levels of TFP. Finally, since Miller and Upadhyay \n(2000) find the inflation rate to be a negative determinant of TFP, we too include this \nvariable. Data on the GNP share of agricultural valued added and inflation rates are \nprovided by the World Bank (2004).  \n \n(iii) Methodology and Results \n \nOur equation to estimate the determinants of TFP is as follows: \n \nlntfpit = \u03b3i + \u03b4t + \u03b81lnXit + \u03b82lnTRADit + \u03b83lnINFLit + \u03b84lnAGRit + \u03b5it  (5) \n \nWhere, X denotes an indicator of health (either malaria, malnutrition or access to safe \nwater), TRAD is trade openness, INFL is the rate of inflation and AGR is the share of \nagriculture in GNP. Subscripts i and t continue to denote country and year, \nrespectively. Note that data for X are not available on an annual basis. \n \nTable 3 provides a variety of estimations based on equation (5), using malnutrition as \nour indicator of health. It reports fixed effects results since Hausman tests suggested \nthat, in most models, the country effects are correlated with the independent variables \nand hence the random effects model cannot be estimated consistently.10 Nevertheless, \nwe report random effects results in the appendix C. \n \n 23 \nTable 3.

We find all variables to be signed and statistically significant in accordance \nwith our prior expectations in almost all cases. Most notably, the proportion of \nundernourished within a country is a negative determinant of that county\u2019s TFP. As a \ngeneral check on the robustness of this result, to see whether it is driven by outliers \nfor example, model (2) replaces our undernourishment variable with a dummy \nvariable. This variable is set equal to one for the one-third of the sample with the \nhighest proportion of population suffering from undernourishment. This technique \ngives equal weighting to all those observations for which the dummy variable is set \nequal to one, thereby reducing the possibility that the result in model (1) is driven by a \n 24 \nhandful of extreme observations. This technique is also used by McCarthy et al. \n(2000). Signs and significance remain very similar to those in model (1). To see \nwhether the coefficient on undernourishment is simply picking up a TFP retardant \n\u2018sub-Saharan Africa effect\u2019, model (3) is estimated using Sub-Saharan African \ncountries alone, whilst (4) uses only non-Sub-Saharan African countries.11 Again, the \nsigns and significance of our estimated coefficients remain very similar to those from \nmodels (1) and (2). The inflation coefficient becomes insignificant for our African \nsample although, with only 29 observations, perhaps not too much weight should be \nplaced on this finding.  \n \nModels (5) and (6) address the potential endogeneity of undernourishment. It is, of \ncourse, likely that an increasing level of TFP within a country could increase that \ncountry\u2019s income and hence reduce the proportion of undernourished. As a first step \ntowards addressing this potential problem, model (5) uses a lagged value of X.12 We \ncan see that, although the coefficient on undernourishment falls in size, it remains \nstatistically significant. Lagging X mitigates the endogeneity problem, but it does not \nsolve it if there is persistence in the country-specific error term over time. To address \nthe issue of endogeneity more comprehensively, we use instrumental variables for \nundernourishment. Such instrumental variables need to fulfil two conditions: First, \nthey must not be endogenous since otherwise they would suffer from the very same \nproblem they are supposed to remedy. Second, they need to be partially correlated \nwith the endogenous variables in the sense that the correlation persists after all other \nexogenous variables are controlled for (Wooldridge, 2002: 84). The stronger the \ncorrelation the better. Instrumental variable estimation effectively rules out \nendogeneity bias since estimations use only that part of the endogenous variable that \n 25 \nis uncorrelated with the error term and is therefore exogenous. We use two \ninstrumental variables which are correlated with the proportion of undernourished yet \nare arguably exogenous with respect to TFP. In addition, they pass standard Sargan \nover-identification tests. These variables are the proportion of a country\u2019s population \nliving in Koppen-Geiger climate zone B (\u2018Dry\u2019), and the proportion of a country\u2019s \narea within this same climate zone.13 These variables capture one specific cause of \nundernourishment. Dry regions are more vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall, \nparticularly those that do not have the infrastructure or the resources necessary to \nfacilitate large scale irrigation and the transportation of water from other regions. \nHence countries with high values of our two instruments are likely to experience food \nshortages, thereby contributing to undernourishment.14 Appendix A provides more \ninformation on our instruments and the sources of these data. The results in Table 3 \nindicate that undernourishment remains a negative, significant determinant of TFP \neven when instrumented. \n \nRandom effects results in Appendix C (Table C1) can also be seen to be very similar \nto those in Table 3 in terms of sign and significance. The proportion of \nundernourished remains a negative, significant determinant of TFP. \n \nWe can now turn to our results estimated using the incidence of malaria as our \nmeasure of a nation\u2019s health. Again, we estimate six models using fixed effects. \n \n 26 \nTable 4.

The incidence of malaria has a strong negative \nimpact on TFP, which is robust across specifications with one notable exception. \nSince the malaria sample contains 52 countries, but only two time series observations, \nwe conserve degrees of freedom by using region-specific, rather than country-\nspecific, fixed effects. Thus, dummies are included for the EU, sub-Saharan Africa, \nSouth Asia, transition economies, Latin America and South East Asia. The sub-\nSaharan Africa dummy therefore controls for possible negative effects on TFP that \nmay be specific to this region, thus the malaria coefficient should not be picking these \nup. We find TFP to be negatively determined by the presence of malaria and a high \nshare of agriculture in GNP. Neither the inflation rate nor trade openness are \n 27 \nconsistently statistically significant. Model 3 contains no country or region dummies \ndue to the small sample size and provides a further check on whether there is an effect \nspecific to sub-Saharan Africa which is driving our results. We estimate a negative, \nsignificant coefficient on malaria within the African sample, but not the non-African \nsample (models 3 and 4). This does not necessarily mean that malaria has no impact \non TFP outside Africa as the random-effects regression suggests a statistically \nsignificant coefficient for the non-African sample (Appendix C, Table C2). \n \nModel 5 uses a lagged value of malaria and finds results broadly similar to those \nestimated using current values of malaria.15 Model 6 uses a two stage least squares \n(2SLS) procedure that instruments malaria using three variables capturing the \nproportion of a country\u2019s land area that is tropical or sub-tropical and a country\u2019s \nmalaria ecology. Malaria incidence is highly correlated with these land area and \necology variables, yet they should be exogenous with regard to TFP. The Sargan \nover-identification test fails to reject the null hypothesis that these are valid \ninstruments The 2SLS estimates are very similar to those from models 1 to 5. These \nfindings are reinforced by the random effects results in Appendix C (Table C2). The \nnegative impact of malaria on TFP is therefore robust across a variety of \nspecifications. \n \nFinally, we consider the impact on TFP of our third indicator of health, lack of access \nto safe water. Table 5 and Appendix C present the results of our models. \n \n 28 \nTable 5.

Model (2) replaces lack of access to safe water \nwith a dummy set equal to one for the 13 countries in which, on average across the \ntime period of our sample, under 50% of the population had access to safe water. This \nvariable is highly significant as well. Model (3) uses only African countries and finds \nthe estimated coefficient on safe water to increase. For non-African countries (model \n4), safe water is also statistically significant. With regard to model (6), identifying \nsuitable instrumental variables for lack of access to safe water proved very difficult. \nWe use the level of urban and rural population density, which are negatively and \npositively correlated with lack of access to safe water, respectively. Contrary to the \n 29 \ninstruments used for under-nourishment and malaria incidence, we are far less \nconfident that these instruments are truly exogenous. The 2SLS estimation results \nmust therefore be treated with some care, although the Sargan test reported in Table 5 \nsupports our use of these instruments, by finding them to be uncorrelated with the \nerror term. Whether this is because our instruments are truly exogenous or because of \nthe potentially low power of the Sargan test to detect their endogeneity, we do not \nknow. In both estimations of model (6) (i.e. in Tables 5 and Appendix C, Table C3) \ninstrumented lack of access to safe water is a negative, significant determinant of TFP \nwith a larger estimated coefficient than in our non-instrumented model (1). \n \n(iv) Summary and Discussion of Results \n \nIn general, we find the impact of poor health on TFP to be negative, significant, and \nrobust across a wide variety of models and specifications. Furthermore, we generally \nfind the share of agriculture in GDP to be a negative, significant determinant. \nAlthough the estimated coefficient on trade openness and inflation are frequently \npositive and negative, respectively, they are often not significant and in few cases \neven contrary to expectations.  \n \nReturning to our health variables, our econometric results yield a number of insights. \nFirstly, we find that the negative, significant impact of health on TFP occurs both \nwithin Africa and outside Africa (i.e. models 3 and 4), at least for undernourishment \nand lack of access to safe water. We are therefore confident that our full-sample \nresults are not being driven by African countries alone. Finally, across the vast \n 30 \nmajority of our estimations, we find the elasticity of TFP with respect to health to be \nlarger in Africa (model 3) than elsewhere.  \n \nTable 6 provides a comparison of the estimated elasticities for our three health \nvariables, from our standard model (model 1) and our instrumental variables model \n(model 6). Both fixed and random effects results are reported. For each health \nvariable we find that the estimated elasticity of TFP with respect to health is smaller \nin our standard model compared to our instrumented model. For malaria, for instance, \nour fixed effects estimation suggests that a 1% increase in the incidence of malaria \nwill reduce TFP by 0.41% in model (1) and 0.70% in model (6). The same pattern is \nfound for undernourishment and lack of access to safe water, whichever of our three \nspecifications is used. \n \nTable 6. A Comparison of Estimated Health Elasticities \nHealth variable Model Fixed Effects Random Effects \nUndernourishment (1) -0.17 -0.22 \n(6) IV -0.21 -0.33 \nMalaria (1) -0.58 -0.75 \n(6) IV -1.06 -1.06 \nLack of Access to Safe \nWater \n(1) -0.09 -0.13 \n(6) IV -0.63 -0.63 \n \nAlthough the elasticities in Table 6 do vary across fixed effects and random effects, in \ngeneral we can see that the elasticities for malaria are larger in magnitude than those \nfor undernourishment and lack of access to safe water in model (1) estimations. A 1% \nincrease in falciparum malaria incidence will reduce TFP by between 0.58% and \n0.75% whilst, for undernourishment and lack of access to safe water the estimated \n 31 \nrange is between 0.17% and 0.22% and 0.09% and 0.13%, respectively. However, \nonce we control for potential reverse causality (model (6)), lack of access to safe \nwater has the highest estimated elasticities at 1.06%. However, this result needs to be \ntreated with some care, given the concerns expressed above about the true exogeneity \nof our instruments for lack of access to safe water. \n \nSection II described some of the possible mechanisms via which poor health can \naffect total factor productivity, although their detailed examination is outside the remit \nof this paper. Nevertheless, our analysis does provide some insights. It is plausible \nthat a significant proportion of the impact of health on TFP occurs through an impact \non labour productivity. However, in addition to this linkage, Section II suggested that \npoor health may also reduce productivity by undermining schooling. Other potentially \nquantifiable linkages between health and TFP include the fact that labour and capital \nmay avoid certain disease infested areas, the rate of return on large scale public \ninvestment projects may be depressed and health budgets may be distorted by a high \ndisease burden. Unfortunately, data limitations significantly hamper the investigation \nof these linkages. But the variety of ways in which health can affect economic \ndevelopment supports our argument that health is best modelled as affecting TFP. \n \nV. Conclusion \n \nIn the light of a number of recent studies showing the adverse impact of poor health \non economic growth (Bhargava et al., 2001; Gallup and Sachs, 2000; McCarthy et al., \n2000; Arcand, 2001), the aim of this paper has been to illustrate that a key mechanism \nthrough which health affects growth is via TFP. Our results suggest that poor health \n 32 \ncan indeed reduce aggregate productivity. It would therefore appear that poor health is \na key factor in explaining the existence of persistent underdevelopment in many \nregions of the world. It has long been known that poverty and underdevelopment play \na significant role in the prevalence of malnutrition, the lack of access to safe water \nand sanitation and the resultant profusion of waterborne diseases, and the general lack \nof medical services and preventative medicine. However, a reversal of this \nrelationship, with poor health itself contributing to poverty and underdevelopment, \nhas generally not been quantified at a macroeconomic level until relatively recently. \nWe have tried to improve on the existing literature by looking at three specific aspects \nof poor health rather than the aggregate measure of life expectancy and by directly \nestimating the effect of health on total factor productivity, rather than economic \ngrowth.  \n \nThe recent creation of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Commission on \nMacroeconomics and Health, chaired by Jeffrey Sachs, suggests that interest in the \nmacroeconomic implications of poor health is increasing. The Commission\u2019s report, \npublished in December 2001 (WHO, 2001), firmly states that poor health within a \nnation can have severe implications for that nation\u2019s macroeconomic performance. \nWith a clear link between health and productivity emerging, the report calls for a \nglobal commitment to tackle health issues. This commitment must come from low-\nincome countries themselves, but also increased financial commitments from donor \ncountries will be needed. It would appear that only increased and re-prioritised \ninvestment in health care, on a global scale, will release the developing world from \nthe vicious cycle that links poor health and poverty. \n 33 \nEndnotes \n                                                 \n1\n DALYs are a common measure of disease burden and combine life years lost due to premature death \nwith fractions of years of healthy life lost as a result of illness. \n2\n There are two more studies, which have included life expectancy at birth in their estimations without \nfocussing on health directly; see Bloom et al. (1999) and Gallup et al. (1999). \n3\n Webber (2002) uses calorific intake as a proxy for human health instead of life expectancy. Further \nbelow we argue that this is a flawed indicator and we measure undernourishment directly. \n4\n We would have liked to have included DALYs by income group in Table 1, but data only exist at a \nregional level. \n5\n Data from FAO (2001). \n6\n Hempel and Najera (1996) claimed that bouts of malaria often coincide with the planting season in \nSpring. \n7\n Appendix B lists the countries in our sample. The number of countries is constrained by the \navailability of capital stock data, particularly for the 1960s. Although several techniques could be used \nto estimate missing values, we believe these to be of questionable accuracy, and hence prefer to use a \nsmaller, although we believe still representative, selection of countries. \n8\n Appendix B provides a ranking of our 52 countries by TFP. \n9\n We use the lack of access to safe water, as opposed to sanitation, due to the larger number of \nobservations reported by the World Bank (2004). The two variables are highly correlated.  \n10\n All estimations in this paper utilize heteroscedastic-robust standard errors. A lagged dependent \nvariable (lntfpit-1) was not favoured on the grounds that both lntfpit and lntfpit-1 will be functions of \u03b3i, \nour country characteristics. Since \u03b3i is part of the unobserved error term, it means that lntfpit-1, an \nindependent variable, is correlated with the error term and hence OLS estimates will be biased.  A \nsolution to this problem is to follow Arellano and Bond (1991) and to estimate a dynamic panel using \nlntfpit-2 as an instrument for lntfpit-1 and to first difference all variables.  However, our limited time \nseries makes such an approach inappropriate. Furthermore, we note that Miller and Upadhyay (2000) \ndo not include a lagged dependent variable in their estimations of TFP. \n11\n Note also that the signs and significance of estimated coefficients in Table 3 (models (1), (2), (5) and \n(6)) were virtually unaffected by the inclusion of a sub-Saharan Africa dummy.  \n12\n Lagging our undernourishment variable means that one year of data is lost.  \n 34 \n                                                                                                                                            \n13\n  The Koppen-Geiger climate system classifies the world into six major climate regions, based on \naverage annual precipitation, average monthly precipitation, and average monthly temperature. Climate \nzone B denotes \u2018dry\u2019 regions and includes many African and Middle Eastern countries, parts of India, \nPakistan, the Southern ex-Soviet states and other regions as varied as parts of China and the US.  \n14\n Of course, undernourishment is often caused by a lack of access to food rather than a lack of food \nper se. Other causes of undernourishment therefore include the prevalence of war, the authoritarian \nnature of government, an inequitable distribution of power\/income and rapid population growth. These \nvariables were not used as instruments since they are unlikely to be exogenous with regard to TFP. \n15\n Again, we lose a year of data when lagging our malaria variable. \n 35 \nAppendix A.
