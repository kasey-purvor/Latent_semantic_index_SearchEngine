We\nexamine its insights in the light of debates leading up and subsequent to\nthe World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva in 2003\nand Tunis in 2005. We argue that many of the issues and dilemmas high-\nlighted by the MacBride Report\u2019s authors exist today.\nThe record of WSIS participants in tackling these issues is unfortunately\nlittle better than that of those who sought to in\u00bauence debates about\nmedia and communication some twenty-\u00aave years ago. Although there\nhas been much talk in the intervening years, there are few signs that in-\nternational debates and diplomatic mechanisms are fostering the equita-\nble development of the media and communication environment that is so\ncrucial for the emergence of information societies in the twenty-\u00aarst cen-\ntury. There is a profusion of smaller and larger initiatives aimed at reduc-\ning various social and economic inequalities including those associated\nwith the media and communication industries. In our view, however, it is\nunlikely that the new institutional forums that have emerged since the\nWSIS will be equal to addressing sources of inequality in areas such as\ngovernance, \u00aanancing, media diversity, freedom of speech, and human\nrights. Nevertheless, and partly as a result of the WSIS dialogue, partici-\npants in civil society are becoming better informed about the issues in-\nvolved. Whereas the WSIS, as the MacBride Commission before it, failed\nto galvanize private and public sector participants into action to promote\nthe massive investment that is needed, the WSIS process did heighten the\npro\u00aale of core international media and communication issues in many key\ninternational forums. It also con\u00aarmed the need to address these issues\nthrough multilateral platforms that encompass all stakeholders, including\ncivil society actors.\nEarlier, shorter versions of this article appear separately in R.

For Sean MacBride\u2019s extraordinary record, including the Nobel Peace Prize and the Lenin Peace Prize, see Becker &\nNordenstreng (1992).\n\u00a9 2007 The Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nInformation Technologies and International Development\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006, 15\u201336\nIn the next section, we summarize the principal\ninsights of the MacBride Report and initiatives intro-\nduced during the 1980s and 1990s and compare\nthem with the issues addressed during the WSIS. In\nsection 3, we locate the MacBride Report and the\nWSIS in the context of the \u201cGreat Media and Com-\nmunication Debate.\u201d This is an ongoing and highly\npolitical debate with major economic and political\nimplications for the diversity of the media and for\nthe gap in the accessibility of communication net-\nworks between the wealthy and poor countries. In\nsection 4, we examine why the passage of time has\nnot prepared the ground for more effective concrete\nactions in key areas following the WSIS. In the con-\ncluding section, we consider the importance of the\ngeopolitical environment for the media and commu-\nnication debate and provide some recommenda-\ntions, especially with respect to the contribution of\nthe academic community in the form of future\nresearch.\nSince the publication of the MacBride Report, there\nhas been huge technological change. Nevertheless,\nthe outcomes of the MacBride Commission\u2019s work\nand those associated with the WSIS have some simi-\nlarities. At the time of the MacBride Report, satellite\ntechnology was regarded as an innovation that\nwould foster greater diversity in the media and pro-\nvide improved and lower-cost access to communica-\ntion services and an array of new telehealth and\neducation services. Today, there is renewed hope\nthat the Internet, digitization, and technological\nconvergence will enable the new information and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs) to reduce the in-\nequalities between rich and poor. The need for di-\nversity in media content, extension of affordable and\nglobal communication networks, and publication of\ninformation free from censure by the state or other\nactors are components of the ongoing information\nsociety debates. The similarities are in the focus of\nrecent debates and those that were taking place in\nthe 1970s and 1980s, which emphasized the links\nbetween media, communication, and the economic\nand social order. When the MacBride Report was\npublished its authors were very concerned about the\ndominance of the industrialized countries\u2014and es-\npecially the United States\u2014in the production and\ndistribution of media content. Today, interest is fo-\ncused on the impact of the forces of globalization\non media production (in terms of both concentra-\ntion of ownership and opportunities for self-publish-\ning through blogs and other new Internet-supported\nservices) and in the resilience of local audiences in\nterms of their capacity to resist external media or to\ntranslate their content into their own cultural\nmilieux.\nMedia regulation and governance of communica-\ntion networks have long been important matters for\ninternational debate. The MacBride Report treated\nmedia and communication policy and regulation as\nformal matters for national governance institutions.\nState governance institutions, including regulatory\nbodies and legislative entities, still have an important\nrole, but civil society actors are now increasingly rec-\nognized as essential actors. On the international\nscene, governance of the media and communication\nis involving a wider range of informal and formal in-\nstitutions. It is questionable, however, whether these\nchanges are alleviating the determinants of inequal-\nity in the media and communication environment.\nThe aspirations of participants in the debates about\ncommunication in the decades preceding the 1980\nMacBride Report and the aspirations of those active\nin the current information society debates are re-\nmarkably similar. Many of the latter want informa-\ntion societies to develop in a way that underpins\nefforts in the economic and political spheres to\ntackle inequality. In our view these aspirations re-\nmain elusive.2 Although awareness has increased\nthis has not produced the political pressure or eco-\n16 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\n2. Our assessment is based, respectively, on Mansell\u2019s participation in international forums hosted by the OECD, agen-\ncies of the United Nations, and the World Bank since the mid-1980s and her ongoing research on \u201ccommunication for\ndevelopment\u201d issues and the role of ICTs, and on Nordenstreng\u2019s participation since the early 1960s in these discus-\nsions in his capacity as a media and journalism scholar and contributor to several UNESCO platforms, as well as to the\nMacBride Roundtable discussions in the 1980s and 1990s. Both authors were active contributors to the WSIS debates\nand monitor ongoing developments in their roles in the International Association of Media and Communications Re-\nsearch (IAMCR).\nnomic investment necessary to alleviate unequal de-\nvelopment, including access to and use of new\nmedia such as the Internet.\nThe MacBride Report represented the culmination\nof years of debate on the need to foster a New\nWorld Information and Communication Order, or\nNWICO (Carlsson 2005), involving wide-ranging dis-\ncussion about how developing countries might use\nthe media and communication networks to become\nmore economically, politically, and culturally self-\nreliant. The NWICO discussion was closely linked to\ncalls from the nonaligned countries of the \u201cSouth\u201d\nfor a new international economic order (Hamelink\n1978). They were supported by the Soviet-led social-\nist countries of the \u201cEast,\u201d which had their own rea-\nsons for pursuing self-reliance and state sovereignty.\nBy the end of the 1970s, discussions in the political\nforums of the time, such as the United Nations, had\nreached a peak. The role of the media and commu-\nnication infrastructure in governing the \u201cfree \u00baow\u201d\nof information was strongly contested during this\nperiod.\nToday equally strongly contested are the need to\nexpand the opportunities for open access to media\ncontent and the Internet, the desirability of limiting\nthe expansion of intellectual property rights protec-\ntion on digital information resources, and the impor-\ntance of \u00aanance to increase literacy and acquisition\nof other capabilities necessary for people to partici-\npate in information societies. These information so-\nciety debates are also occurring in a highly charged\npolitical environment. There are calls for debt relief\nfor poor countries, and the United Nations millen-\nnium goals include numerous targets that focus at-\ntention on the importance of reducing poverty.\nDespite all the debate and effort, the strength of\nglobal forces of capital shows few signs of diminish-\ning within the media and communication sphere.\nThese forces are providing incentives for pro\u00aatability\nthat often restrict access to new ICTs and to con-\ntent, and the tensions that characterized earlier de-\nbates between those that regarded the media as\nessential to foster open and public debate and those\nthat regarded the media as instruments of state\ncontrol continue to be very much present.\nThe republication of the MacBride Report in\n2004 has increased accessibility to its insights for the\ncurrent generation of researchers, activists, and\npolicymakers. It is important that these be assessed\nin the light of today\u2019s developments to consider\nwhat has been achieved since the report\u2019s initial\npublication. In his foreword to the new edition,\nCalabrese (2004, xiv) argues that, \u201cin the MacBride\nReport, we \u00aand a spirit of hopefulness about how a\nbetter world is possible, about the continuing im-\nportance of public institutions as a means to ensure\nglobal justice at local, national, and transnational\nlevels, and about the value of global communication\nas a means to knowledge, understanding, and mu-\ntual respect.\u201d This spirit of hopefulness was comple-\nmented by eighty-two recommendations for action,\nmany of which are still relevant. These recommenda-\ntions are set out under themes: strengthening inde-\npendence and self-reliance; social consequences and\nnew tasks; journalistic professional integrity and\nstandards; democratizing communication; and fos-\ntering international cooperation.3 These themes em-\nphasize the essential link between media and\ncommunication policies and social, cultural, and\neconomic development objectives. They also stress\nthe importance of participation by all factions of so-\nciety in the de\u00aanition of these objectives, although\nthe term civil society had not come into use. The re-\nport called for the elimination of all forms of com-\nmunication gaps\u2014foreshadowing present-day\ndiscussions about digital divides. It emphasized the\nuse of all means of communication (using both\nolder and newer technologies) and of education.\nThe MacBride Report\u2019s emphases resonate with the\ncurrent emphasis on the importance of fostering\nmedia literacies, of strengthening capacities for local\ncontent production, and of widening access to the\ncommunication infrastructure.\nThe MacBride Report authors acknowledged that\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006 17\nMANSELL, NORDENSTRENG\n3. Space limitations do not allow a full exposition of the content of the report. The subissues addressed under these\nthemes were strengthening independence and self-reliance (communications policies, strengthening capacities, basic\nneeds, particular challenges); social consequences and new tasks (integrating communication into development, facing\nthe technological challenge, strengthening cultural identity, reducing the commercialization of communication, access\nto technical information); professional integrity and standards (responsibility of journalists, improved international re-\nporting, protection of journalists); democratizing of communication (human rights, removal of obstacles, diversity and\nchoice, integration and participation); and fostering international cooperation (partners for development, strengthening\ncollective self-reliance, international mechanisms, international understanding).\nachieving equity in all these areas would require ma-\njor changes in the structure and organization of me-\ndia and communication markets. Their call for\nchanges in media and communication regulation\nand market structures presaged later moves to pro-\nmote telecommunication market liberalization, and\npolicies aimed at curtailing the monopoly power and\ndominance of the newspaper and broadcast compa-\nnies; however, neither the work of the MacBride\nCommission nor the speci\u00aac recommendations of\nthe report can be regarded as having led directly to\nchanges in policy, regulation, or market structures.\nSubsequent changes in communication markets\nwere pushed through on a competitiveness agenda\ndriven largely by the industrialized countries; only a\nfew countries worldwide introduced measures, of\nvarying effectiveness, to curtail the power of the\nmajor media companies.\nAlthough some commentators have criticized the\nMacBride Report for its statist approach to \u00aanancing\nthe development of information content and the\ncommunication infrastructure, it can be seen in an-\nother light. It can be read as emphasizing noncom-\nmercial or public provision of communication\nservices and media as an alternative to market-led\nmechanisms. This is similar to WSIS participants\u2019\ncalls for preservation of a public space for the media\nand for scienti\u00aac, education, and information con-\ntent, free from overly restrictive IPR protection. The\nMacBride Report also addressed the need for a code\nof conduct for journalists and measures to protect\nfreedom of speech and diversity of media content;\nsimilar calls for codes and communication or infor-\nmation rights protections were made at the WSIS.\nThe MacBride Report recommended \u201cutilizing funds\nprovided through bilateral governmental agreements\nand from international and regional organizations\u201d\n(MacBride Commission 1980\/2004, 268) to tackle\nthe gaps between the rich and the poor. The WSIS\nacknowledged that public sector or donor agency\nfunding would be insuf\u00aacient to reduce the gap in\nresources needed to alleviate inequalities in the me-\ndia and communication \u00aaeld. Civil society actors are\ncalling for the use of multiple mechanisms for\n\u00aanancing and a reduction in sole reliance on market\nmechanisms, echoing the recommendations of the\nMacBride Report.\nThe MacBride Report contained a diversity of ur-\ngent priorities for action. The WSIS Declaration and\nits associated plan of action emphasized the need\nfor international and regional cooperation, universal\naccess and bridging the digital divide, investment\npriorities, and mainstreaming ICTs within the work\nof donor organizations. Both sets of documents em-\nbrace a mishmash of actions and aspirations. In the\nWSIS case, and in contrast to the MacBride Report,\nspeci\u00aac targets were established for 2015; however,\nnearly all of these targets relate to technology rather\nthan the media, communication processes, and hu-\nman beings.4 In the plan of action there are refer-\nences to capacity and con\u00aadence building, the need\nfor a conducive legal and institutional environment,\nissues related to cultural diversity and identity, lin-\nguistic diversity and local content, the media, and\nthe ethical dimensions of the information society. All\nthese areas are highlighted as urgent for action and\nthus are a wish list that does not include means of\nimplementation, at least not on a scale that would\nbring about a step shift in the reduction of informa-\ntion society inequalities.\nWhile the detail from the MacBride Report and\nthe WSIS is overwhelming and unlikely to be fully\nacted upon both for political and economic reasons,\nperhaps the renewed emphasis on media and com-\nmunication as vital social processes will have an im-\npact on decision making about information\nsocieties. The MacBride Report strongly emphasized\nthe social aspect and the potential contribution of\nthe media and communication to forces of democ-\nratization. Its authors expressed their hope for the\n18 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\n4. The targets in the plan of action illustrate the strong focus on ICTs. These targets may be taken into account in the\nestablishment of the national targets, considering the different national circumstances: to connect (a) villages with ICTs\nand establish community access points; (b) universities, colleges, secondary schools, and primary schools with ICTs; (c)\nscienti\u00aac and research centers with ICTs; (d) public libraries, cultural centers, museums, post of\u00aaces, and archives with\nICTs; (e) health centers and hospitals with ICTs; (f) all local and central government departments and establish Web sites\nand e-mail addresses; (g) to adapt all primary and secondary school curricula to meet the challenges of the information\nsociety, taking into account national circumstances; (h) to ensure that all of the world\u2019s populations have access to tele-\nvision and radio services; (i) to encourage the development of content and to put in place appropriate technical means\nto facilitate the presence and use of all world languages on the Internet; (j) to ensure that at least half the world\u2019s in-\nhabitants have access to ICTs.\nemergence of societies in which there would be\n\u201cthe diffusion of power through broader access to\nand participation in the communication process; . . .\nthe bene\u00aats of communication used as an educa-\ntional and socializing force; . . . the reduction of in-\nequalities through democratization; [and] . . . the\nabolition of the vestiges of domination as full na-\ntional liberation becomes a reality\u201d (MacBride Com-\nmission 1980\/2004, 6).\nThis statement resonates with the aspirations\ncaptured in the WSIS Declaration, which expresses it\nslightly differently. The WSIS Declaration starts from\na \u201cCommon Vision of the Information Society.\u201d It\nemphasizes information and knowledge rather than\nthe media or the communication process but ex-\npresses the \u201ccommon desire and commitment to\nbuild a people-centred, inclusive and development-\noriented Information Society, where everyone can\ncreate, access, utilize and share information and\nknowledge, enabling individuals, communities and\npeoples to achieve their full potential in promoting\ntheir sustainable development and improving their\nquality of life, premised on the purposes and princi-\nples of the Charter of the United Nations and re-\nspecting fully and upholding the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights\u201d (WSIS 2003a, par. 1).\nThe WSIS Declaration also sees ICTs as contribut-\ning to the achievement of the development goals of\nthe United Nations Millennium Declaration5 and\nreaf\u00aarms \u201cthat everyone has the right to freedom of\nopinion and expression,\u201d stating that \u201ccommunica-\ntion is a fundamental social process, a basic human\nneed and the foundation of all social organiza-\ntion. . . . Everyone, everywhere should have the op-\nportunity to participate and no one should be\nexcluded from the bene\u00aats the Information Society\noffers\u201d (WSIS 2003a, par. 4).\nUnfortunately, as Cees Hamelink (2004a, 281) has\nsuggested, \u201cthe \u00aanal Declaration of the WSIS com-\nmences with the aspiration of a common vision. The\nend result is however a blurred confusion.\u201d The\nMacBride Report was similarly ambitious and in\nplaces also similarly self-contradictory. The of\u00aacial\ndocuments of the WSIS were complemented by an\nunof\u00aacial civil society declaration, \u201cShaping Informa-\ntion Societies for Human Needs.\u201d The centrality of\npeople and of poverty reduction was very clear in\nthis Declaration: \u201cAt the heart of our vision of infor-\nmation and communications societies is the human\nbeing. The dignity and rights of all peoples and each\nperson must be promoted, respected, protected and\naf\u00aarmed. Redressing the inexcusable gulf between\nlevels of development and between opulence and\nextreme poverty must therefore be our prime\nconcern\u201d (Civil Society Declaration to the WSIS\n2003, 2).\nBoth the MacBride Report and the WSIS docu-\nments comment on the relationships between com-\nmunication and society with special attention to the\nsocial, political, economic, and educational dimen-\nsions, as well as to the problems created by unequal\naccess to media and communication networks. The\nMacBride Report, however, throws out a stronger\nchallenge to the persistent overemphasis on techno-\nlogical advance at the expense of attention to media\nin\u00bauences on the construction of meaning and\nshared cultural understandings. Its authors discuss in\ndetail the problems created by the \u201cone-way \u00baow\u201d\nof communication from the dominant economic\ncenters of the world; by a failure to encourage criti-\ncal awareness of the relationships among the media,\njournalism ethics, and democratization; and by the\nabsence of policies to encourage the equitable\nspread of communication infrastructure and diversity\nin media content. Its central conclusion is that \u201cthe\nutmost importance should be given to eliminating\nimbalances and disparities in communication and its\nstructures, and particularly in information \u00baows. De-\nveloping countries need to reduce their dependence,\nand claim a new, more just and more equitable or-\nder in the \u00aaeld of communication. This issue has\nbeen fully debated in various settings; the time has\nnow come to move from principle to substantive re-\nforms and concrete actions\u201d (MacBride Report\n1980\/2004, 253).\nToday\u2019s vocabulary perhaps makes the political\nand economic \u201cdependence\u201d on the wealthy indus-\ntrialized countries less evident. Globalization has led\nto concerns about unequal interdependence among\ncountries and regions, but the desire for a \u201cjust and\nmore equitable order\u201d remains strong. The MacBride\nReport was explicit about the importance of the so-\ncial, political, and economic development agenda in\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006 19\nMANSELL, NORDENSTRENG\n5. See www.un.org\/millenniumgoals\/ retrieved April 20, 2007.\nthe context of decisions about media and communi-\ncation policy, emphasizing in particular the \u201cpolitical\nfoundations of development\u201d: \u201cSince information\nand communication may today become\u2014as never\nbefore\u2014the sources of the creation of wealth, the\nsystem responsible for the existing communication\ngaps and the inequality in this sphere threaten to\nwiden the gulf between the rich and the poor. . . .\nBut the basic decisions in order to forge a better fu-\nture for men and women in communities every-\nwhere, in developing as well as in developed\nnations, do not lie principally in the \u00aaeld of techno-\nlogical development: they lie essentially in the an-\nswers each society gives to the conceptual and\npolitical foundations of development\u201d (MacBride\nCommission 1980\/2004, 12\u201313 [emphasis added]).\nDevelopment issues, poverty, and inequality, and\nthe importance of a political will to foster greater\nequity were clearly signaled by the MacBride Report\nas being more important than the potential of tech-\nnological innovation in isolation. The MacBride\nCommission was relatively small, and the report\nre\u00baected its members\u2019 individual experience in the\ncontexts of the wealthy and poor countries.6 In con-\ntrast, the WSIS documents were the result of a con-\nsensus, brokered by of\u00aacials and a few accredited\nparticipants in the WSIS main, of\u00aacial forum. These\nwere mostly government and intergovernmental\nof\u00aacials, although some of the texts prepared by\ncivil society representatives were incorporated in\ntheir reports.\nThe members of the MacBride Commission and\nUNESCO spokespersons were not alone in the\n1980s in acknowledging the relationships among\nthe media, the extension of communication net-\nworks, and development prospects. For example, in\n1984, the Independent Commission for World Wide\nTelecommunications Development, established by\nthe International Telecommunication Union (ITU),\nproduced the Missing Link, a report produced by the\ncommission\u2019s chair, Sir Donald Maitland, a senior\nBritish diplomat, which argued that \u201call mankind\ncould be brought within easy reach of the telephone\nby the early part of next century\u201d (Maitland 1984,\n69). This report focused on development of the un-\nderlying telecommunication infrastructure, but, like\nthe MacBride Report, its authors emphasized that\nthe main challenge was not simply greater invest-\nment in technology, but promotion of the strategies,\nmarket and regulatory mechanisms, technical and\nmanagement capabilities, and training and \u00aanancing\nfrom multiple sources. The Missing Link report au-\nthors, again like the MacBride Report authors, em-\nphasized the \u201cpolitical character\u201d of their task,\nstating that disparities between rich and poor were\nunacceptable \u201cin the name of common humanity\u201d\n(Maitland 1984, 3).\nBoth these reports stressed the need to address\ndevelopment of media and communication net-\nworks in the light of the problems created by in-\nequalities throughout society. In the late 1970s,\nconcerns focused on the spread of cultural domina-\ntion as a result of one way or vertical \u00baows of infor-\nmation and communication, the intensi\u00aacation of\nthe \u201cindustrialization of communication\u201d and the\nimpact of \u201ctransnationalization,\u201d leading to the\ndominance of a few media producers over global\nand local markets. There was concern that an infor-\nmation explosion might defeat people\u2019s capacities to\nproduce and consume a diverse array of informa-\ntion. It was also acknowledged that \u201cthe subjects of\nimbalance and domination were among the most\ncontentious in the early rounds of the world-wide\ndebate on communications\u201d (MacBride Commission\n1980\/2004, 164).\nOngoing information societies debates have\nsome commonalities in terms of the issues that were\ndiscussed and which proved to be the most conten-\ntious in the 1980s. Participants in the WSIS ex-\npressed their anxieties about the vast quantity of\ninformation resources circulating within the Internet\nand the increasing personalization of information re-\nsource access, which potentially excludes diverse\nsources of information, and continuing imbalances\nin the capabilities to produce and consume informa-\ntion among and within different regions of the\nworld. The reasons why these issues are contentious\nare many, but in essence they re\u00baect tensions\namong those keen to rely mainly on market-led de-\nvelopments and those that are lobbying for a major\n20 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\n6.

For instance, there\nare those who claim that today\u2019s digital divides are\nof small concern as mobile telephone networks are\nreaching even the poorest communities; for them it\nis simply a matter of time before market-led initia-\ntives close the digital divide. For others, concern is\ngrowing about the widening disparities\u2014not neces-\nsarily in terms of access to technology, but in terms\nof the capabilities and literacies required to bene\u00aat\nfrom its potential and the concentration and power\nof the media.\nAlthough the MacBride and Maitland reports\nmay for a time have languished on the shelves of\nthose whom their authors sought to in\u00bauence, by\nthe late 1990s UNESCO was renewing efforts to fos-\nter discussion on the problems associated with in-\nequality in the development of information societies,\nthe term being used in place of NWICO. Part of its\nefforts consisted of sponsoring several INFOethics\nconferences aimed at highlighting the importance of\naccess to public information content, and to net-\nworks and services, increased rights of access to ed-\nucational, scienti\u00aac and cultural information, and\nprotection of privacy and freedom of expression. At\nits third conference in 2000, the then assistant direc-\ntor-general of UNESCO suggested that \u201cWisdom\ncomes from our understanding of what the ICTs can\nbe used for, how they can be used and with whom\nthey can be used. . . . Our understanding of the eth-\nical, societal and legal implications of the ICTs for\nhuman beings is essential. . . . Education, in its full-\nest sense, is, in my opinion, the ultimate answer to\nuniversal access to information and knowledge shar-\ning\u201d (UNESCO 2000, 65).\nEthical, societal, legal, and governance arrange-\nments for ICTs were given precedence over concerns\nabout the technologies themselves. This initiative\nsignaled the need for substantial attention to in-\nequalities in access to information, the communica-\ntion infrastructure, and education and in legal\nprotection of information or communication rights.\nAlthough the WSIS highlighted many of these issues\nas being important, there are reasons for some\nskepticism about whether the political will to ad-\ndress them is any stronger than it was after the pub-\nlication of the MacBride Report. The situation\nappears to be as unclear as it was in the 1980s and\nearly 1990s (see, for example, Nordenstreng and\nSchiller 1993). At about the same time as UNESCO\nwas rekindling these debates, the World Bank\n(1998) published its world report on \u201cknowledge for\ndevelopment,\u201d highlighting both information and\nknowledge as keys to poverty reduction. By the end\nof the 1990s, debates about emerging information\nor knowledge societies had reached a new peak in\nnumerous national, regional, and international\nforums.\nBy the 2003 and 2005 WSIS, there was height-\nened awareness of these issues, but no clarity about\nwho would be best positioned to take the lead in\nfostering continuing open dialogue and action. In\nthe next section, we examine some of the similari-\nties and differences in the political and economic\ncontexts surrounding the various stages of the\n\u201cGreat Media and Communication Debate.\u201d We do\nso to demonstrate why the political will to take ac-\ntions to introduce fundamental change leading to\ngreater equity in the media and communication \u00aaeld\nremains so weak.\nThe MacBride Report stands as a milestone in media\nand communication history just as the WSIS will\nwith the passage of time. The work of the MacBride\ncommissioners was not primarily a scienti\u00aac exercise\nto discover the worldwide state of media and com-\nmunication; it was \u00aarst and foremost designed to be\na political stock taking of the socioeconomic forces\nin\u00bauencing the contemporary media and communi-\ncation \u00aaeld. Similarly, the WSIS can be seen as a po-\nlitical response to a variety of pressures resulting in a\nprocess and events intended to give a high pro\u00aale to\nmeasures aimed at reducing inequalities in informa-\ntion societies.\nThe MacBride Report emerged in the context of\nwhat came to be known as the \u201cGreat Global Me-\ndia Debate\u201d (Gerbner et al. 1993; Padovani and\nNordenstreng 2005). This debate, for analytical pur-\nposes, can be seen as emerging through \u00aave, rela-\ntively clearly demarcated, major stages that began in\nthe 1970s, each with one or more milestones of its\nown.\n1. 1970\u201375 Decolonization Offensive\n\u2022 Idea of information imperialism\n\u2022 Concept of a New International Information\nOrder (NIIO) proposed by UN\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006 21\nMANSELL, NORDENSTRENG\n2. 1976\u201377 Western Counter-Attack\n\u2022 Establishment of World Press Freedom Com-\nmittee\n\u2022 Delayed introduction of UNESCO\u2019s Mass Me-\ndia Declaration in Nairobi\n\u2022 Proposal of a \u201cMarshall Plan for telecommu-\nnications\u201d\n3. 1978\u201380 Truce\n\u2022 Adoption of UNESCO\u2019s Mass Media Declara-\ntion\n\u2022 Work and report of the MacBride Commis-\nsion\n\u2022 Consensus on the concept of a New World\nInformation and Communication Order\n(NWICO)\n\u2022 Establishment of the International\nProgramme for the Development of Commu-\nnication (IPDC)\n4. 1981\u201390 Western Offensive\n\u2022 Conference of Voices of Freedom in Talloires\n\u2022 United States and United Kingdom withdraw\nfrom UNESCO\n\u2022 Unseating of UNESCO\u2019s Director General\nM\u2019Bow\n\u2022 Killing the concept of NWICO\n5. 1991\u2013 Globalization Culminating in\nthe WSIS\n\u2022 Global markets versus cultural exception\n\u2022 Multinational corporations versus global civil\nsociety\n\u2022 Digital divide concerns\n\u2022 Information societies and knowledge socie-\nties in the context of poverty reduction\nThe politics of the \u00aarst four stages have been exam-\nined elsewhere in terms of how they in\u00bauenced de-\nvelopments in the international policy arena for\nmedia and communication policy (see Nordenstreng\n1984, 1999). The \u00aafth stage, commencing in the\nearly 1990s, focused on the role of the media and\ncommunication in the face of the forces of global-\nization. It culminated in the WSIS. Although this\nglobalization stage can be broken down into several\nphases, for our purpose, which is to consider the\npolitical forces in\u00bauencing the narrative about policy\nin the media and communication sphere during this\nperiod in terms of the way it both parallels and de-\nparts from earlier phases of the \u201cgreat debate,\u201d this\nis not essential.\nThe MacBride Report was published soon after\nthe release of UNESCO\u2019s Mass Media Declaration in\n1978. The idea of an international commission to\nstudy the global problems of media and communi-\ncation grew out of a political deadlock within\nUNESCO in the mid-1970s. The drafting of a decla-\nration on \u201cfundamental principles concerning the\ncontribution of the mass media to strengthening\npeace and international understanding, to the pro-\nmotion of human rights and to countering racialism,\napartheid and incitement to war\u201d was underway\n(UNESCO 1978, 1). A draft was voted on by the ma-\njority of participants in an intergovernmental confer-\nence in 1975; it contained strong formulations of\nstate responsibility for the media and reference to a\ncontroversial UN resolution equating Zionism with\nracism, which galvanized participants to express\ntheir views on the declaration, culminating in a\nwalkout by the Western countries. UNESCO\u2019s direc-\ntor general Amadou-Mahtar M\u2019Bow suggested a\n\u201cre\u00baexion group of wise men\u201d in a bid to circum-\nvent a political crisis during the General UNESCO\nConference in Nairobi in 1976 (Nordenstreng 1984,\n20, 112). This crisis was largely due to mounting dis-\nagreements about UNESCO\u2019s competence for estab-\nlishing normative standards for the media and\ncommunication. Those governments that supported\nthe declaration were from the nonaligned develop-\ning countries and the socialist economies of eastern\nEurope. Those in the camp against the language of\nthe declaration were the governments of the West\nand the major media producers and publishers.\nA compromise achieved at the Nairobi confer-\nence was to postpone the launch of a standard-\nsetting declaration and establish a commission. This\nbroke the political deadlock and created a positive\nenvironment conducive to the redrafting of the Dec-\nlaration.7 A three-year process was set in place for\npreparation of the report of the International Com-\nmission for the Study of Communication Problems,\nor the MacBride Commission. In the course of pre-\n22 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\n7. Nordenstreng served on a team of three, which in 1977\u201378 prepared a \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d revised draft declara-\ntion for UNESCO\u2019s secretariat. A detailed account of this process is given in Nordenstreng (1984).\nparing the report the commission studied more than\na hundred background papers (see MacBride\nCommission 1980\/2004, 295\u2013302).\nAt the same time, a parallel instrument was be-\ning discussed that was intended to help to avoid any\nfuture impasse. The idea was to establish an inter-\nnational fund to support the development of the\nmedia and communication infrastructure in develop-\ning countries. This was a joint initiative by the mod-\nerate developing countries, notably Tunisia, and\nleading Western countries, and offered material as-\nsistance to developing countries in the form of a\n\u201cMarshall Plan of Telecommunications.\u201d The West-\nern offer was led by U.S. President Jimmy Carter\u2019s\nadministration. The aim was to adopt a tactical shift\nfrom stick to carrot with the intention of persuading\nthe developing countries from espousing a militant\nline, thereby \u201ctrading ideology against coopera-\ntion.\u201d This diplomatic \u201cbuy out\u201d led to the estab-\nlishment of the IPDC within UNESCO (see Norden-\nstreng 1984, 16\u201322; 1999, 244\u2013245); however, this\ninitiative failed to attract the \u00aanancial support\nenvisaged.\nThe MacBride Commission was the basis of a\nmaneuver to play down the anti-imperialist momen-\ntum of the nonaligned movement\u2019s advocacy of a\nnew international economic order and to neutralize\nattempts designed to enable the agencies of the\nUnited Nations system to set standards for the mass\nmedia. For the political West this momentum pre-\nsented a serious threat as the political South was\nempathically supported by the Soviet-led political\nEast. Of course, there were idealists, including Sean\nMacBride himself, for whom the commission\nrepresented a genuine quest for discovering and ad-\ndressing the global problems of media and commu-\nnication, but the main motivations and crucial\nforces lay with the realists, including M\u2019Bow, who\nwanted to achieve a compromise between the aspi-\nrations of the capitalist West, the socialist East, and\nthe nonaligned South. And there was room for\ncompromise\u2014a truce in the information war\u2014in\nthe late 1970s, largely due to East-West d\u00e9tente and\nthe oil crisis, which supported those Western strate-\ngists that preferred the carrot to the stick.\nIt was in this spirit that the idea of a new inter-\nnational order in the \u00aaeld of media and communica-\ntion came to be broadly accepted as a consensus,\nunderstood as \u201can evolving and continuous pro-\ncess\u201d instead of a \u00aaxed standard. The NIIO echoing\nthe anti-imperialist drive of the South and the state-\nsovereignty approach of the East was replaced with\nthe less controversial \u201cNew World Information and\nCommunication Order,\u201d or NWICO. This watered-\ndown new order thinking was manifest in the\nMacBride Report\u2019s subtitle: Towards a New More\nJust and More Ef\u00aacient World Information and Com-\nmunication Order.\nThe balance of global forces changed dramati-\ncally soon after the MacBride Report was published\nand the rebalancing process led to a shift in the for-\ntunes of the NWICO concept and its lobbyists. Fol-\nlowing Ronald Reagan\u2019s election to president in\n1980 the policy of the United States was redirected\nfrom multilateralism toward unilateralism and the\nemployment of power politics, with a relative weak-\nening of the then USSR and the nonaligned move-\nment. The truce of the late 1970s was followed by a\nnew Western offensive in the 1980s. At this stage\nthe elements of compromise that earlier had been\nregarded as valuable and honorable, very suddenly\nwent out of fashion and became liabilities. M\u2019Bow\ndeparted, mainly for political reasons, although his\nmanagement style and pro\u00aale were used to veil the\nreal reasons for his departure, and NWICO became a\ntaboo topic at UNESCO.\nIn the broader context of Western politics,\nUNESCO came to be regarded as a burden. The Rea-\ngan administration decided that the United States\nshould leave the organization, and the United King-\ndom under Margaret Thatcher followed suit soon\nafter. It is important to understand that the reasons\nfor the American and British departures from\nUNESCO were not primarily the NWICO debate, the\nMacBride Report, or M\u2019Bow\u2019s leadership. The under-\nlying cause in both cases was a strategic shift away\nfrom multilateralism\u2014a warning to the international\ncommunity that leading Western powers refused to\nbe outvoted by the majority of the world\u2019s nations.\nAs expressed in a Newsweek interview with a for-\nmer assistant secretary of state in the Carter admin-\nistration, \u201cUNESCO was the Grenada of the United\nNations\u201d\u2014a relatively small target used to demon-\nstrate what could be done on a larger scale if the in-\nterests of the big powers were not respected.\nUNESCO\u2019s record after M\u2019Bow\u2019s reign\u2014in media\nand communication and in other sectors\u2014for a pe-\nriod of time was far from honorable. The organiza-\ntion not only abandoned the strategic direction of\nthe South and the East; it did its utmost to appeal\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006 23\nMANSELL, NORDENSTRENG\nto the West\u2014not least to the nonmember state, the\nUnited States. For example, it attempted to censor a\nbook that exposed UNESCO\u2019s about-face in the area\nof media policy (Preston et al. 1989). The culture in\nUNESCO during the 1980s and early 1990s was to\nview the MacBride Report, and the NWICO debate,\nas politically incorrect. During this period there was\nno interest in making new imprints of the MacBride\nReport.\nThese then were the political conditions that gave\nrise to the commission and to the context within\nwhich the MacBride Report was prepared. The re-\nport itself can be assessed in terms of whether it\nrepresented a document that adequately captured\nthe emerging world of media and communication at\nthe time. Communication scholars came together as\na group to produce a critical assessment of the re-\nport (Hamelink 1980) immediately after its publica-\ntion.\nA critical reading of the report suggested that it\ntreated the history of the media and communication\nin isolation from fundamental social and global de-\nvelopments (Nordenstreng 1980). For example, al-\nthough it referred to \u201cone world,\u201d it was argued\nthat the report did not project a coherent picture of\nthe dynamics and con\u00baicts informing the history or\nlikely future of the media and communication indus-\ntries (Nordenstreng 1980). Instead, as Nordenstreng\nsuggested, it provided an abstract image of these\ndevelopments, accompanied by a discussion of a\nnumber of more or less disconnected phenomena\nand debates. It presented the \u201ccrucial problems fac-\ning mankind today\u201d as a simple list of familiar issues\nwith no explicit explanation of the theoretical and\npolitical controversies that they represented. The re-\nport was viewed as counterproductive because it did\nnot reveal the deep interrelationships between the\nmedia and communication and other social phe-\nnomena. These interrelationships were not evident\nbecause the concept of communication used by the\nreport\u2019s authors was drawn principally from the\nmainstream of bourgeois liberalism. It incorporated\na functionalist, positivist, and ahumanistic approach,\nwhich came increasingly to predominate in later de-\nbates about the role of the media and communica-\ntion in society. This profound weakness was\nsummed up at the time in the following way. \u201cThe\nReport is an excellent illustration of the dilemma of\neclecticism: you try to be comprehensive but you\nlose the totality which you are supposed to discover.\nIn this respect the Report could well be called \u2018Mis-\nsion Impossible\u2019\u201d (Nordenstreng 1980, 249).\nAlthough this judgment about the scholarly\nworth of the document still stands, as a political\nmilestone the report, together with the scholarly\ncommentary, has withstood the test of time. Cees\nHamelink, for instance, noted that the report had\nunderplayed the growing strength of transnational\ncorporations and their implications for the output of\nthe media and the development of communication\nnetworks and services. He argued that the MacBride\nReport did not adequately foresee that the \u201cone\nworld\u201d of the future, in the absence of changes in\npolicy and regulation, would be one in which major\ncorporations would play a very major role in shaping\nthe media environment. In this assessment he was\nprophetic: \u201cThe Report, although rightly pointing to\nthe crucial role of transnational corporations in the\n\u00aaeld of international communications, did not\nsuf\u00aaciently recognize that the new international in-\nformation order is indeed likely to be the order of\nthe transnational corporations. The \u2018one world\u2019 the\nReport ambitiously refers to in its title may very well\nbe the global marketplace for transnational corpora-\ntions\u201d (Hamelink 1980, 281). The next generation of\nmedia and communication scholars reached similar\nconclusions about the way that the MacBride Report\nhad served not to open up informed scholarship and\npolicy debate but rather to close it down because of\nthe assumptions it made about the openness of\nglobal markets and the roles of major media and\ncommunication \u00aarms. (Samarajiva and Shields 1990;\nSamarajiva and Holli\u00aaeld 1994; Mansell 1995).\nIn the \u00aafth, globalization, stage of the \u201cGreat\nMedia and Communication Debate,\u201d we can return\nto the report to reexamine the insights it holds for\nresearchers and policy analysts. In the later part of\nthe 1990s, as we have seen, there were signs of a\nrenewed willingness to address many of the issues\nthat the MacBride commissioners had addressed,\nthis time under the rubric of information or knowl-\nedge society issues. Concerns about the digital di-\nvide and its implications for social and economic\ninequality, together with the political momentum\ncreated by the civil society movement, began to fos-\nter a new political space for dialogue.\nAlthough the MacBride Report is relatively light-\nweight when measured against scholarly criteria, it\nprovides today\u2019s civil society organizations and the\n24 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\ncurrent generation of researchers a text signaling\nthe crucial role of the media and communication in\na globalizing world in which democracy, participa-\ntion, ethics, and rights are high on the international\nagenda. Its observations on these issues help to clar-\nify directions for the global movement toward de-\nmocracy and equity in media and communication,\nbuilding on the decolonization offensive of the early\n1970s. Most of the MacBride Report\u2019s eighty-two\nrecommendations were never implemented (Han-\ncock and Hamelink 1999), and most of the issues\nreappeared on the agenda of the WSIS in one guise\nor another.\nThe MacBride commissioners\u2019 views are neverthe-\nless valid and important. They point to measures\nthat are needed if we are to halt the trends that are\nproducing deeper divisions between the wealthy\nand the poor and the media and communication\nnetworks that are sustaining such divisions, even\nthough the technology and the political context they\ninitially referred to have changed. For example, the\nMacBride Report (1980\/2004, 206, 214, 219) called\nfor policies at national and international levels to\nachieve the necessary \u201callocation of public re-\nsources, decisions about general structure for com-\nmunication activities, elimination of internal and\nexternal imbalances, and de\u00aanition of priorities,\nwhich naturally vary from one country to another.\u201d\nThe need to develop such policies is as urgent today\nas the need to de\u00aane priorities. Although the\nMacBride Report highlights certain priorities, its long\nlist of recommendations is akin to, and covers simi-\nlar areas as, the long list of measures encompassed\nby the WSIS Plan of Action, which introduces the\nrisk that efforts to redress these issues will be inade-\nquate in light of the huge number of topics.\nThe MacBride commissioners called for measures\nto \u201cpromote endogenous capacities in all countries\nfor devising, producing and using new communica-\ntion technologies, as well as programs and their\ncontent.\u201d They observed that \u201cinternational assis-\ntance in general, tends to remain of ad hoc nature,\nsporadic and poorly integrated into overall develop-\nment plans.\u201d The huge effort that still is needed to\nbuild local capabilities, combined with the \u201cstop\u2013\ngo\u201d nature of ICT and \u201ccommunication for develop-\nment\u201d projects, suggest that little heed has been\npaid to these earlier recommendations. Efforts to\nmainstream ICT-related issues continue to be contro-\nversial, and the emphasis is on technology diffusion\nrather than on the assessment of information and\ncommunication needs, speci\u00aacally tailored to poor\ncommunities, countries, and regions of the world.\nThe MacBride commissioners called for new edu-\ncation programs to counter what they regarded as\nforces that could foster the standardization and ho-\nmogenization of the media environment. In line\nwith their emphasis on education, they called for\nless focus on the fascinating potential of technology\nand greater effort to foster literacies to equip people\nto choose and discriminate between the products of\nthe media and communications industry. The WSIS\nputs some degree of emphasis on literacies, al-\nthough associating them more broadly with infor-\nmation and knowledge than with the media in\nparticular.\nThose supporting the concept of the NWICO in\nthe early phases of the Great Media and Communi-\ncation Debate envisaged it as \u201can open-ended con-\nceptual framework . . . [that] pre-supposes a new\ndistribution of available resources in accordance with\ntheir [the poorer sections of the world\u2019s population]\nvital rights and needs\u201d (MacBride Report 1980\/\n2004, 39). Similarly today, civil society actors and\nbusiness community stakeholders that support the\nopen software movement envisage information\nsocieties that respect the rights and needs of all,\nproviding open communication and media diversity\nrather than exclusion for all but the loudest media\nindustry voices. The spread of the Internet and the\nnew opportunities for self-publication and expres-\nsion via blogs, e-mail, chat rooms, and webcams of-\nfer new prospects for such developments, but do\nnot mean that the problems of the past with respect\nto media closure and control of communication net-\nworks have dissipated. Not only are new media such\nas the Internet unavailable or too costly for many of\nthe world\u2019s poor, but issues such as the role of the\ntraditional and new media in the education of citi-\nzens, in promoting trust and democratic participa-\ntion, and the reliability of information of both\nknown and unknown provenance continue to de-\nmand attention from all the stakeholders in the cur-\nrent phase of the debate.\nDespite the fact that they were writing in the late\n1970s, the authors of the MacBride Report envis-\naged a network akin to the globally distributed\nInternet that has emerged. They pointed to the po-\ntential democratizing in\u00bauence of \u201ca web of com-\nmunication networks, integrating autonomous or\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006 25\nMANSELL, NORDENSTRENG\nsemi-autonomous, decentralized units\u201d (1980\/2004,\n12). Under certain conditions, they argued, \u201cthe ad-\nvance in modern electronic systems . . . also offers\nthe possibility of localized, inexpensive, \u00baexible and\ndecentralized communication structures which facili-\ntate broader public access and participation\u201d (1980\/\n2004, 150).\nSome of those conditions have been fostered by\ninnovations in ICT hardware and software, not least\nthe Internet protocol and the introduction of the\nWorld Wide Web. The Internet\u2019s evolution has been\ncharacterized by decentralized forms of governance.\nThis situation, however, could quickly change if the\npolitical climate were to shift in the face of an en-\nforcement of the security agenda. This agenda\nthreatens to override established media-related\nrights and freedoms as well as the open and, so far,\nrelatively insecure Internet. If achieving greater infor-\nmation and network security and reliability as a\nmeans of reducing real or perceived risk become a\nhigher priority for governments and \u00aarms, the po-\ntential of localized, \u00baexible, and decentralized net-\nworks and media could be jeopardized. The political\nand economic context clearly has changed since the\nNWICO debate, but many of the political and eco-\nnomic issues are the same.\nThe momentum provided by the WSIS makes it\nvery important to draw on the insights documented\nin academic publications and professional forums\nsuch as the MacBride Round Table discussions orga-\nnized since 1989 (Vincent et al. 1999) and work by\nscholars in the \u00aaeld of media and communication.\nThere are some scholarly works that brought these\nissues into focus in the years leading up to the WSIS\n(for example, Mansell and Wehn 1998; Mansell\n1999a, 2001, 2002; Hamelink 2000, 2004b; Raboy\n2002; Goonasekera et al. 2003). Government\nof\u00aacials, private sector spokespersons, and represen-\ntatives of civil society sought support for measures\nto encourage more transparent governance of the\nInternet, improved policy aimed at extending infra-\nstructure and services, and codes of conduct sup-\nporting open dialogue and debate in the media (see\nfor instance, the special issue of Information Tech-\nnologies and International Development (2004) on\nthe WSIS; Instituto del Tercer Mundo [2005];\nMilward-Oliver [2005]; and Stauffacher and\nKleinw\u00e4chter [2005]).\nFollowing the WSIS there has been debate about\nwhether the process and its outcomes succeeded in\nproviding a renewed foundation for action to ad-\ndress the problems confronted by the economically\ndisadvantaged. For example, Cammaerts (2006),\nHamelink (2006), and Raboy (2006) have all sug-\ngested that the WSIS process was important in\nterms of raising awareness among civil society actors\nabout the issues, but they are less than convinced\nthat the WSIS created a political will for action to\ntackle injustices and inequalities in the media and\ncommunication \u00aaeld. In the next section, we exam-\nine three key areas where there is a crucial need for\naction but little sign that the WSIS can be regarded\nas being instrumental in bringing about fundamen-\ntal changes in direction.\nThe current terminology refers to the information or\nknowledge society.8 There has been a shift in the\nrhetoric compared to the early stages of the so-\ncalled Great Media and Communication Debate.\nNevertheless, the contemporary terminology echoes\nthe MacBride Report\u2019s notion of \u201cone world.\u201d The\nemphasis in debates in international forums has\nshifted toward the role of ICTs in knowledge accu-\nmulation and increasing emphasis on the economics\nof the production and consumption of information.9\nToday\u2019s discussion is perfunctory about the problems\ncreated by imbalance and domination in the media\nand communication industries and the political and\neconomic contexts in which information societies\nare developing. For instance, debate tends to be\ncentered on the emergence of the information soci-\nety rather than a diverse interlinked set of informa-\ntion societies with distinct histories, voices, and\nfutures. The MacBride Report, however, emphasized\nthe centrality of media diversity, the communication\n26 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\n8. The use of the preposition \u201cthe\u201d suggests that there is only one society characterized by the importance of informa-\ntion, a suggestion that is clearly contradicted by historians such as Innis (1950). Similarly, references to \u201cthe\u201d knowl-\nedge society convey a singular vision of the role of knowledge in society.\n9. During the WSIS process, UNESCO tried to move a more socially and culturally oriented concept of knowledge socie-\nties onto the agenda (see UNESCO 2005). However, \u201cthe\u201d information society prevailed as the main concept and \u201cthe\u201d\nknowledge society (singular) appeared only in the last sentence of the WSIS Declaration of Principles.\nprocess, and the need for a major investment initia-\ntive.\nOf course, the debates about the information so-\nciety are occurring within the wider political and\neconomic context of globalization. Politically, talk of\nfostering democracy is coinciding with state-led or\nencouraged wars within states, supported by the\nwealthy industrialized countries, notably the United\nStates and the United Kingdom. Economically, the\ngrowing dependence of the global economy on\nelectronic services means that efforts to preserve\nand extend the commodity model of information\nproduction are strong, as evidenced by attempts to\nstrengthen intellectual property rights protection of\ndigital information (Mansell and Steinmueller 2000).\nCivil society organizations are increasingly visible and\ntheir representatives are vocal on citizens\u2019 rights is-\nsues, and, in some areas, technological innovation is\nsupporting open access to information and media\nproduction by citizens, in new ways. Examples in-\nclude the many efforts in both the wealthier and the\npoorer countries to promote open source software\nand to develop intellectual property rules consistent\nwith an open information commons, alongside ex-\nisting restrictive rules.\nThe political context of the globalization stage of\nthe Great Media and Communication Debate, like\nthe MacBride Commission before it, is the result of a\npolitical compromise. A WSIS was proposed initially\nduring the International Telecommunication Union\nplenipotentiary conference in Minneapolis in 1998.\nIt was argued that the \u201cITU is the organization best\nable to seek appropriate ways to provide for devel-\nopment of the telecommunication sector geared to\neconomic, social and cultural development.\u201d The\nITU was seeking at the time to reposition itself as a\nforum capable of shaping an international commu-\nnication environment following years of telecommu-\nnication privatization and liberalization. In the effort\nto achieve this it needed to promote issues of inter-\nest to developing countries, as well as the wealthier\ncountries that were home to many of the ICT pro-\nducer \u00aarms.\nThe summit later became the subject of a United\nNations (2002) General Assembly Resolution, giving\nit potential prominence on the world stage. Al-\nthough the relevance of many United Nations agen-\ncies was acknowledged, UNESCO does not \u00aagure in\nthese early documents, despite the fact that, in the\nlatter part of the 1990s, it had promoted ethical, so-\ncietal, and legal debates. The ITU became the lead\norganization in the WSIS, with UNESCO playing a\nless visible role in the preparations. Its Web site\nstated that \u201cUNESCO\u2019s contribution incorporates the\nethical, legal and sociocultural dimensions of the In-\nformation Society and helps to grasp the opportuni-\nties offered by the ICTs by placing the individual at\nits centre,\u201d10 but the strong emphasis on technology\nin the \u00aanal WSIS documents, especially the ICT indi-\ncators, shows that it was the interests of those more\nclosely aligned with the ITU that prevailed at the\nsummit.\nThe formal parts of the WSIS did not reach the\nkind of impasse that led to the withdrawal from\nUNESCO of the United States and the United King-\ndom in an earlier stage of the debate. Globalization\nhad changed the geopolitical landscape and in-\ncreased the prominence of countries such as China\nand India in various hardware, software, and ser-\nvices segments of the ICT market. On the economic\nfront, little progress was made in the WSIS in terms\nof \u00aanding the resources to reduce the digital divide.\nOn the political front, although the post-9\/11 envi-\nronment meant that the United States government\nhad a very strong potential interest in the role of the\nmedia and in promoting the use of ICTs in support\nof democratization movements in the Middle East\nand elsewhere, by the time of the summit in 2003\nthe focus was shifting to concerns associated with\nnational security and the role of ICTs and the media\nin this context. The heady days when ICT market\nsaturation in the wealthy countries was creating\nnew pressures to open developing country markets\nto new media products and services had all but dis-\nappeared. The dot.com crash had dampened the\nenthusiasm of investors in ICTs and Internet-related\ndevelopments and markets were languishing, in\ncontrast to conditions when the idea of a WSIS was\n\u00aarst discussed. By 2005, many new commercial op-\nportunities were emerging in relation to the devel-\nopment of more secure networks, and the impetus\nto extend networks into poor areas regarded by ICT\n\u00aarms as marginally pro\u00aatable had reduced.\nThe contradictions in the wider political and eco-\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006 27\nMANSELL, NORDENSTRENG\n10.

These\nsame contradictions help to explain why little prog-\nress was made on issues related to media freedom,\ninformation or communication rights and responsi-\nbilities, or \u00aanance and investment. These were\namong the many issues that remained unresolved\nafter the \u00aarst phase of the WSIS in December 2003.\nThe most contentious issues in the MacBride deliber-\nations were \u00aanance, governance (or policy and regu-\nlation), and rights\u2014albeit for different political\nreasons.\nThe Plan of Action of the WSIS (2003a, par. 27)\ncalled for a \u201cdigital solidarity agenda\u201d that \u201caims at\nputting in place the conditions for mobilizing hu-\nman, \u00aanancial and technological resources for inclu-\nsion of all men and women in the emerging\nInformation Society.\u201d Reminiscent of the 1970s\n\u201cMarshall Plan for Telecommunications,\u201d this\nre\u00baected the need to \u00aanance efforts to expand the\ndevelopment of the media and communication in-\nfrastructure, equipment, capacity building, and con-\ntent. Following the 2003 WSIS, a task force was set\nup to examine existing \u00aanancing mechanisms and\nthe feasibility of creating a voluntary digital solidarity\nfund.11 This fund, led by the president of Senegal,\nwas established and received some relatively small\ncontributions prior to the second phase of the sum-\nmit in 2005. At the end of 2004, the Report of the\nTask Force (2004, 10\u201311) included the observation\nthat funding \u201cshould be seen in the context of avail-\nable \u00aanancing for the broader set of development\nagendas and goals.\u201d It called for improved cross-\nsectoral and institutional coordination, more multi-\nstakeholder partnerships, stronger emphasis on do-\nmestic \u00aanance, private sector support for locally\nrelevant applications and content, strengthening ca-\npacities to secure and use funds effectively, and in-\ncreased voluntary, consumer-based contributions. In\nreferring to the digital solidarity fund, the \u201cTask\nForce felt that it was not in a position to assess its\nrole among the various ICT \u00aanancial mechanisms\u201d\n(Report of the Task Force 2004, 13). Just as the IPDC\nin the 1980s had failed to attract substantial fund-\ning, so the new solidarity fund has been poorly sup-\nported in spite of the enthusiasm of a few cities and\nthe Swiss government. The opportunity to under-\ntake a huge \u00aanancial effort, at the time of the\nMacBride Report envisaged as being through the\nIPDC, has been missed again.\nIn the lead-up to the WSIS independent analyses\nwere made of the adequacy of existing \u00aanancing\nmechanisms (Instituto del Tercer Mundo 2005; Peyer\n2005). They concluded that, whereas market-led\nforces would continue to predominate in \u00aanancing\ninformation society development, there are many\ncomplementary and creative approaches that could\nbe adopted. This is essentially the conclusion\nreached by the MacBride Report\u2019s authors. Some of\nthese approaches involve adjustments to market\nmechanisms, while others require community or co-\noperative initiatives and public funding through tax-\nation or development assistance. Over the years,\nthere have been many efforts to persuade \u00aarms that\ninnovative approaches to providing affordable com-\nmunication services in poor areas could be pro\u00aatable\nin the medium term (Mansell 1999b). Such ap-\nproaches require proper assessments of the propor-\ntion of disposable income that the poor would be\nwilling to spend on communication (rather than mis-\nleading estimates that are based on the experience\nof wealthy countries), examinations of the cost-\nrevenue relationships associated with microprepay\nservices for new services such as mobile telephony,\nand reconsiderations of the policy and regulatory\nbarriers to such schemes. Although some work has\nbeen done in these areas, there is little enthusiasm\non the part of either major ICT or communication\nservice providers, which continue to resist such de-\nvelopments on a large scale in most countries for\ncommercial or competitiveness reasons (Milne\n2006).\nAlthough the major ICT supplier \u00aarms were visi-\nble in the trade shows that were mounted during\nthe WSIS, and they conducted product launches\naimed at the poor, their presence was rather muted\nin the formal debates, and in terms of making dura-\nble commitments to new, much-needed, investment\nschemes to address the digital divide. Although it\nwas recognized that a huge \u00aanancial effort will be\nneeded to correct imbalances and reduce the domi-\nnation of major media producers and communica-\n28 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\n11.

Those whose interests in short-\nrun pro\u00aats outweigh their interests in extending net-\nworks and media diversity in many parts of the\nworld, prevailed. WSIS participants could have re-\nsorted to existing partnership initiatives to deliver\nlow-cost Internet access terminals that were in the\nplanning or prototype stage based on a combination\nof government and private funding (Mansell 2006);\nindeed, they could have initiated a new twenty-\u00aarst-\ncentury Marshall Plan for media and communica-\ntion. And if such a plan had won the backing of in-\nvestors, they would have done well to heed the\nMacBride Report\u2019s exhortation to focus more on\ncommunication needs than on the technology.\nIn contrast to the MacBride Report\u2019s statist ap-\nproach to media and communication planning and\n\u00aanancing, the WSIS process emphasized the impor-\ntance of partnerships between public and private\nstakeholders and the inclusion of civil society organi-\nzations in decision making. The development and\nuse of media and communication products and ser-\nvices depend ultimately upon market-led supply and\ndemand, something clearly recognized by the WSIS\nparticipants and by the MacBride Report\u2019s authors.\nIn a global environment in which disparities per-\nsist,12 numerous regulatory and policy measures are\nstill needed to augment market forces. For the most\npart, however, the WSIS participants focused on\nnew media or Internet governance\u2013related issues\nrather than on attempts to grapple with barriers to\ngreater investment.\nInternet governance proved to be a strongly con-\ntested issue for the WSIS participants, and many of\nthe developments in this area have implications for\nolder media and communication platforms as over-\nlaps between online Internet-based and traditional\nmarkets increase in the publishing, press, broadcast,\nand communication \u00aaelds. The Working Group on\nInternet Governance (WGIG) was established to\nmake proposals for action at the 2005 summit. This\nmove was designed to circumvent a political dead-\nlock between those, including the United States, fa-\nvoring status quo arrangements and those calling\nfor more transparent, public oversight of the devel-\nopment of the Internet (Kleinw\u00e4chter 2004a,\n2004b). The WGIG was given a mandate that in-\ncluded developing a working de\u00aanition of Internet\ngovernance; identifying public policy issues relevant\nto Internet governance; and developing a new un-\nderstanding of the roles and responsibilities of gov-\nernments, international organizations and other\nforums, the private sector, and civil society.13 Its re-\nport (WGIG 2005) presented alternatives for facili-\ntating Internet access for all and for fostering a\nstable and secure Internet with diverse, multilingual\ncontent.\nThe controversies over governance arrangements\nwere essentially over scarce resources whose charac-\nteristics and distribution have major political and\neconomic implications. The treatment of Internet\naddresses and domain names and their manage-\nment are of major importance for the Internet\u2019s\nlong-term development. The Internet\u2019s architecture\nand its protocols will be in\u00bauenced substantially by\nthe prevailing governance arrangements which are\nmaintained by the Internet Corporation for Assigned\nNames and Numbers (ICANN) and several related or-\nganizations. These arrangements were criticized for\nfailing to account adequately for the interests of de-\nveloping countries and civil society actors. As a pub-\nlic-private organization, there was unease about\nICANN\u2019s decision-making structures and processes.\nProposals for change made prior to the 2005 sum-\nmit ranged from introducing a global governance\nsystem through a UN agency, such as the ITU, to\nmaintaining the status quo. Those backing the\nstatus quo included major media and communica-\ntions producers based mainly in the wealthy indus-\ntrialized countries as well as some members of the\nacademic community (see Oxford Internet Institute\n2005). Despite the fact that the Internet is an open\nnetwork, those organizations seeking to pro\u00aat from\nits use are regarded by some as having dispropor-\ntionate sway over its development, especially in rela-\ntion to plans to introduce differentiated quality of\nservice for Internet services (David 2007).\nThe WGIG Report (2005) made suggestions for\nimproved governance with a view to strengthening\nthe inclusiveness of participation, coordinating policy\nat world level, and bringing greater transparency\nand equity to all facets of Internet governance. It\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006 29\nMANSELL, NORDENSTRENG\n12. As documented by empirical studies, see for example Gillwald (2005) and Zainudeen et al. (2006).\n13. Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG), see www.wgig.org\/About.html retrieved April 20, 2007.\nwas explicit that, although by no means the only is-\nsue, high priority should be given to the question of\nunilateral control by the U.S. government of the ad-\nministration of the root zone \u00aales and system. It\nconcluded that \u201cno single government should have\na pre-eminent role in relation to international\nInternet governance\u201d (WGIG 2005, 12). Proposals\nwere made for the creation of global forums or\ncouncils for discussion of policy-related issues. The\nresponse of the WSIS in Tunis in 2005 to these pro-\nposals was for an Internet governance forum (IGF)\nto be established under the auspices of the United\nNations. The stakeholder groups who would partici-\npate formally were selected but there were some\nconcerns about the representativeness of the civil\nsociety actors. Nevertheless, the forum\u2019s initial meet-\ning in October 2006 was open to civil society actors\nand academics. Although an important initiative, it\nwill be some time before it becomes clear whether\nthe IGF can in\u00bauence the future accessibility and\nopenness of the Internet. This will remain a politi-\ncally charged issue, with continuing frictions be-\ntween those keen to guard against pressures to\nintroduce a high-quality and uncongested Internet\nfor those who can pay and a second-tier Internet for\nthose unable to afford the costs of the high-quality\nservice.\nHow the Internet and its governance regime\n\u00aanally evolve will be subject to the geopolitical\nwinds of change. A probable outcome will be that\nthe actual or perceived risks from the Internet\u2019s con-\ntent or threats to the infrastructure will result in\nstrong efforts to control the Internet\u2019s development\nin line with state and economic interests in the\nwealthy countries, and the United States in particu-\nlar (Mansell and Collins 2005). The concerns ex-\npressed in the MacBride Report about the potential\nfor innovative technologies to be shaped to the in-\nterests of powerful economic or political forces are\nextremely relevant today.\nThe MacBride Report\u2019s authors signaled that contra-\ndictions in society\u2014that is, con\u00baicts between the in-\nterests of major political or economic actors\u2014could\nlead to media and networks that would embed the\nvalues of hierarchy and centralization and increased\nsocial control, accompanied by inequalities. As one\nmeans of resolving such contradictions in the inter-\nests of all citizens, they called for a \u201cright to com-\nmunicate\u201d to be enshrined in a UN declaration on\nassociation, information and development rights. At\nthe time, their thinking was informed in part by\nRichstad and Harms (1977, np) statement to the ef-\nfect that\nEveryone has the right to communicate: the com-\nponents of this comprehensive Human Right in-\nclude but are not limited to the following speci\u00aac\ncommunication rights: (a) a right to assemble, a\nright to discuss, right to participate and related\nassociation rights; (b) a right to inquire, a right to\nbe informed, a right to inform, and related infor-\nmation rights; c) a right to culture, a right to\nchoose, a right to privacy, and related human de-\nvelopment rights. . . . The achievement of a right\nto communicate would require that communica-\ntion resources be available for the satisfaction of\nhuman communication needs.\nDuring the WSIS, communication or information\nrights issues and the potential for far-reaching\nchange to redress inequalities in this area emerged\nand became the subject of major debate, at least\namong the civil society participants (Padovani 2004).\nThese concerns were less visible in the texts pro-\nduced in the WSIS formal sessions.\nIn the post-9\/11 environment and in the face of\nthe \u201cwar on terror,\u201d proponents of measures to\npromote information surveillance and intrusive mon-\nitoring of citizens\u2019 access to information and com-\nmunication networks are voluble (Lyon 2004). The\npolitical environment in most of the wealthy coun-\ntries is fostering these developments in the name of\nsecurity. Although there is resistance in some quar-\nters, many national surveys are being interpreted by\ngovernments as suggesting that, for the most part,\nthe general population is not averse to measures\nthat challenge existing human rights legislation. De-\nspite the results of independent analyses of citizens\u2019\nperspectives on issues of privacy protection and sur-\nveillance (see Bennett and Raab 2003), since 2001\nnew national security legislation has been passed in\nmany countries, including poorer ones (Caidi and\nRoss 2005). Discussion about the information rights\nor communication rights that need to be upheld in\nthe face of such measures continues, but it is frag-\nmented and contested even among civil society ac-\ntors and within the academic community.\nThere is unlikely to be an early resolution of con-\ntroversies in this area. A surge, at least in the short\n30 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\nterm, in the political will to incorporate such rights\nin a new international declaration is unlikely, regard-\nless of the WSIS document\u2019s recommendations\nabout the need to respect human rights. If the WSIS\nhad prompted action in the direction of a new dec-\nlaration, this could have committed the signatories\nto foster media and communication environments\nconsistent with the objectives of \u201csustainable devel-\nopment, democracy, and gender equality, for the at-\ntainment of a more peaceful, just, egalitarian and\nthus sustainable world, premised on the principles\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and\nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\u201d (Civil\nSociety Declaration 2003, 2). In the absence of such\naction, there is good reason to monitor the confor-\nmance of state and nonstate actors to existing citi-\nzen rights. The main impetus at present is to\nimprove collaboration in information security and\nmonitoring globally, with respect to potential terror-\nist actions. Questions of freedom of speech and the\nimplications of politically or commercially motivated\ncensorship of media and information content will\ngive rise to ongoing debate about the need for hu-\nman rights protections (see, for example, Thomas\nand Nain 2002; Kalathil and Boas 2003; Klang and\nMurray 2005; Dean et al. 2006). In this regard, there\nare substantial differences in the focus of current\ndiscussions and those that took place in earlier\nstages of the Great Media and Communication De-\nbate. It is the availability of the Internet and devel-\nopments in new media that facilitate monitoring\nand surveillance that are rendering protection and\ninfringement of human rights topics of very high\npriority, such that the MacBride commissioners could\nnot have foreseen.\nOur conclusions about the impact of the WSIS are\nsimilar to those of the scholars who commented on\nthe MacBride Report. Regardless of the potential of\nthe WSIS to garner widespread support for the\nkinds of changes needed to reduce inequality in to-\nday\u2019s information societies, especially in those issue\nareas highlighted in this article, it is to the sphere of\ngeopolitics and the forces of globalization that we\nmust turn for an explanation of the failure to intro-\nduce the necessary changes in governance, \u00aanance,\nand human rights protection. There was a major\nchange in the geopolitical environment following\nthe MacBride Report\u2019s publication with the shift\nfrom U.S.-led multilateralism to unilateralism. This\nbrought with it an overriding concern for U.S. inter-\nests in the media and communication \u00aaeld, rather\nthan a desire to support development initiatives\naimed at the disadvantaged. In the present stages of\nthe Great Media and Communication Debate, and\naround the time that the WSIS was being planned in\nthe \u00aarst years of this century, there was a shift from\nthe relatively outward-looking multilateral politics of\nthe Clinton administration to the equally outward-\nlooking, but unilateral, politics of the Bush adminis-\ntration. This shift, combined with a more globally in-\nterdependent economy, has meant that the\nlikelihood of the WSIS aspirations being converted\ninto concrete actions aimed at achieving greater eq-\nuity in information societies is much reduced. In ad-\ndition, the turmoil created by the continuing \u201cwar\non terror\u201d has meant that \u00aanancial resources are\nlikely to be devoted to measures to enhance the se-\ncurity of existing networks and services. This will cre-\nate growing markets for software developers and\nhardware manufacturers in the wealthy countries,\nalleviating pressures on \u00aarms to expand into less lu-\ncrative markets in developing countries, at least for\nthe time being.\nOur conclusions must be tempered, however, by\nthe advances made by civil society actors as a result\nof the WSIS, in prizing open formerly closed deci-\nsion-making forums at the international level. The\ncivil society coalition that participated in the WSIS\nmay not have represented a broad alliance that\nwould enable the full participation of the poor and\nother excluded groups (Cammaerts and Carpentier\n2005); however, its members have succeeded in rais-\ning the pro\u00aale of \u00aanance, governance, and media\nand communication rights and responsibilities. Al-\nthough this coalition may have failed to modify the\nactions proposed in the mainstream WSIS Plan of\nAction substantially, it introduced some helpful lan-\nguage into the documents in relation to issues of\neducation, media freedoms, and gender, for exam-\nple. There has also been a precedent set for greater\nparticipation in the IGF and future international fo-\nrums and a greater awareness of the need for\n\u00aanancial support to extend the reach and inclusivity\nof global media and communication networks.\nIt may be argued that incremental policy reform\nis the answer to reducing inequality, that market\nforces ultimately will provide media and communica-\nVolume 3, Number 4, Summer 2006 31\nMANSELL, NORDENSTRENG\ntion services that are affordable for all, and that top-\ndown government intervention to provide \u00aanancing\nwill only distort the ef\u00aacient working of markets;\nhowever, the record of market liberalization and pri-\nvatization in the communication industry in the\npoorest countries is not good (Gillwald 2004). In ad-\ndition, media ownership and concentration concerns\nwith respect to media diversity have not disappeared\nfrom the political agendas in many countries, and, in\nsome industry segments, there is evidence of in-\ncreasing concentration (Thomas and Nain 2002). A\nmix of public- and private-sector initiatives is essen-\ntial if the poorest areas of the world are to be in-\ncluded in the information societies that are\nchampioned by those that supported the aspirations\nin the WSIS Declaration.\nAs can be applied to the MacBride Report, we\nmust look to the wider political and economic con-\ntext in which the WSIS occurred for an explanation\nof the slow progress that is being made to redress\nthe digital divide and related issues. In the context\nof the MacBride Report, it was understood that\nproblems could be tackled only by a huge effort in-\nvolving the establishment of mechanisms to achieve\ninternational cooperation and partnerships for devel-\nopment. The MacBride Report did not explicitly ac-\nknowledge that this would require a favorable\npolitical environment. Similarly, explicit discussion of\nthe politics informing information society develop-\nments is missing from the WSIS documents. Follow-\ning the WSIS, the political environment might be\nthought to be rather more conducive to addressing\nthe problems underlying poverty and inequality and\nthe constraints to the emergence of equitable infor-\nmation societies. After all, the governments of the\nUnited Kingdom and many of the European Union\nmember states have made efforts to tackle poverty\nand to agree on debt relief for poor counties.\nContradictions will remain, however, between\nthe interests of those who seek to pro\u00aat from infor-\nmation societies and those who seek to promote\nthem in ways that are consistent with reducing\nworld poverty and fostering communication that\nsupports human dignity and respect. It will be\ninsuf\u00aacient to rely on technological innovation and\nthe market to bridge the gaps. Similarly, it will be\nunsatisfactory to assign the development of media\nand communication for the poor, to those espousing\nthe bene\u00aats of public\u2013private\u2013civil society partner-\nships. This will produce little momentum to imple-\nment or scale them up. Without action to tackle\nmarket and nonmarket barriers to greater invest-\nment and more effective participation by all stake-\nholders in the debate about information societies,\ntwenty-\u00aave years on from the WSIS we are likely to\nsee yet new forms of injustice that discriminate\nagainst the poor. Measures are needed to encour-\nage the diversity of media content, to encourage\nthe ethical conduct of journalists, stem abuses of\ncitizens\u2019 rights, and overcome uneven access to new\ngenerations of ICTs.\nResearch on the role of media and communica-\ntion in development (Hemer and Tufte 2005) is pro-\nducing a strong argument for positive action at the\ninternational level in the areas of governance,\n\u00aanance, and human rights with respect to media\nand communication. The argument rests heavily on\nthe fact that the media and communication in infor-\nmation societies are intertwined with social justice\nand equity. As Cohen (2001, 168, 183) so vividly ar-\ngues, the media \u201chave a near monopoly in creating\nthe cultural imagery of suffering and atrocities. . . .\nThe principle of social justice does not depend on\nyour moral awareness of people like you\u2014but your\nreadiness to extend the circle of recognition to un-\nknown (and even unlikable) people who are not all\nlike you.\u201d\nThe topics we have highlighted will be the sub-\njects of hotly contested debate in multiple forums in\nthe coming years. Averting a negative outcome of\nthe WSIS and associated initiatives will not be easy\nand will require the involvement of all stakeholders,\nincluding the academic community. As media and\ncommunication scholars, we have an obligation to\nspotlight the contradictions that arise from the vary-\ning stakeholder interests. We are often well-placed\nto suggest political action, economic development\nstrategies, and organizational coalitions that will\nprovide a buffer against the forces that threaten to\nundermine the construction of equitable information\nsocieties. Critical analysis is needed of the dynamics\nof institutional change with respect to policy and\nregulation at national, regional, and international\nlevels and studies of alternative ways of supporting\nmultistakeholder involvement in dialogues about the\nmedia and communication needs of the poor. We\nneed to examine the interfaces between bottom-up\nand top-down strategies for change and to maxi-\nmize education, learning, and capability building.\nEvaluations must be made of the multiple factors\n32 Information Technologies and International Development\nGREAT MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEBATES: WSIS AND THE MACBRIDE REPORT\nthat must coalesce to enable the spread of media\nand communication networks to support the poor.\nUnderstanding people\u2019s needs must be the over-\nriding concern of development strategies that, in\nturn, should inform media and communication ini-\ntiatives. Research alone will not provide the neces-\nsary solutions. Research needs to be translated into\npolitical action sponsored by broadly-based coali-\ntions of actors. This remains essential for the reason\nexpressed by Sean MacBride just over twenty-\u00aave\nyears ago: \u201cAs communication is so central to all so-\ncial, economic and political activity at community,\nnational and international levels, I would paraphrase\nH. G. Wells and say human history becomes more\nand more a race between communication and ca-\ntastrophe. Full use of communication in all its varied\nstrands is vital to assure that humanity has more\nthan a history . . . that our children are assured a fu-\nture\u201d (MacBride Commission 1980\/2004, xxi).\nThis interplay between research and practice is\nvery dif\u00aacult but is unavoidable if we are to tackle\nthe causes and consequences of world media and\ncommunication inequalities. The MacBride Report,\ncombined with recent work on the determinants of\ninequality in information societies, provides a foun-\ndation for essential future work on the politics of\nthe media and communication globally, and on the\nprospects for equitable evolution of information\nsocieties. \u25a0\nBecker, J., & Nordenstreng, K.
