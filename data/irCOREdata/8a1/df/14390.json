As editors,\nour approach is to support authors in developing and improving their submissions to\nALT-J through a constructive, iterative process; simple statistics about rejection rates\nundercut this intention. Consequently, we will provide a fuller picture of the review-\ning process.\nOur reviewers are vital to our efforts at dialogue with authors, providing detailed\nand considered feedback. This is reflected in our submission statistics, where only\n15% of submissions to ALT-J in 2005 were accepted subject to minor amendments.\nReviewers recommended that a further 35% of submissions in 2005 were suitable for\npublication after major amendments; of these submissions, 70% were eventually\n132 Reviewers \npublished. This gives a total acceptance rate of about 40%, but shows the value of the\nreviewing process in raising the quality of the majority of articles we publish.\nCollectively, our reviewers have contributed to enhancing the quality of ALT-J,\nand we are extremely grateful to them.\nJane Seale, Martin Oliver and Grainne Conole\nEditors, ALT-J\n"}
