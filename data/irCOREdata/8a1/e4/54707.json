Introduction\n[2] In the polar oceans, seawater freezes to form sea ice of\nseveral meters thickness that can cover up to 15 \u00b7 106 km2 in\nthe Arctic and 20 \u00b7 106 km2 in the Antarctic. Sea ice plays a\nsignificant role in determining polar and global climate and\nGlobal Circulation Models (GCMs) used for climate pre-\ndiction incorporate representations of sea ice dynamics and\nthermodynamics. Although GCMs use continuum sea ice\nmodels, there is strong observational evidence of discon-\ntinuous sea ice dynamics. At the scale of sea ice floes,\ndeformation is concentrated in leads and ridges but dis-\ncontinuous deformation is also observed in bands that\nextend from tens to thousands of kilometers, as illustrated in\n3 year deformation maps over the western basin by Kwok\n[2001]. Such bands are usually referred to as slip lines\n[Erlingsson, 1991; Overland et al., 1998] or linear kine-\nmatic features [Kwok, 2001]. The slip lines frequently\nintersect at acute angles apparently independent of the\nspatial scale [Walter et al., 1995; Weiss, 2001] and delineate\nregions of approximately diamond\u2010shaped floe aggregates.\n[3] The floe aggregates, which we shall refer to as blocks,\nconsist of floes frozen together. Wilchinsky and Feltham\n[2006] developed a model of sea ice dynamics that treated\nthe ice cover as a collection of diamond\u2010shaped blocks. In\nthis theory, the rheology of the ice cover depended upon the\norientation of the diamonds, which was allowed to evolve\naccording to kinematic and mechanical processes, including\nfracturing. Here, we focus on the initial formation of the\nblocks, i.e., the fracturing of an ensemble of frozen\u2010together\nfloes into floe aggregates. We follow Hopkins et al. [2004],\nwho studied the fracture of a sea ice cover using a discrete\nelement model that considered compressive and tensile\nfailure of interfloe joints as floe move under an applied wind\nstress. When a crack starts to form, a relaxation wave travels\noutward and reduces stresses in the surrounding pack.\nHopkins et al. [2004] found, under typical wind stress pat-\nterns, that the model produced rectilinear blocks, in contrast\nto the observed diamond\u2010shaped blocks.\n[4] It has been argued [e.g., Schulson, 2001; Weiss and\nSchulson, 2009], based upon a strong similarity between\nsea ice leads and wing cracks observed in the laboratory,\nthat slip lines form through a mechanism of shear rup-\nture, i.e., failure\/crack formation once sufficient shear\nstress is reached. We accordingly extend the study of\nHopkins et al. [2004] by incorporating into the discrete\nelement model a representation of shear rupture. We find\nthat the modified discrete element model now reproduces\n1Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, National Centre for Earth\nObservation, University College London, London, UK.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\n3CRREL, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Hanover, USA.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JC006043\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, C10002, doi:10.1029\/2009JC006043, 2010\nC10002 1 of 13\nthe observed diamond\u2010shaped blocks under typical wind\nstress patterns.\n[5] The discrete element model, model of shear rupture,\nwind forcing, and configuration of the numerical experi-\nments is described in section 2. In section 3, the discrete\nelement simulations of block formation are presented and\nthe results discussed in terms of the controls on the block\nsize and shape: subsection 3.1 describes uniaxial compres-\nsion with varying wind stress; subsection 3.2 describes\nuniaxial compression with varying tensile strength; and\nsubsection 3.3 describes biaxial compression as the con-\nfinement ratio is altered. Our main conclusions are sum-\nmarized in section 4.\n2. Model Configuration\n[6] We use a discrete element sea ice model originally\ndeveloped by Hopkins [1996] and expanded by Hopkins\net al. [2004]. Hopkins et al. [2004] used the model to\nstudy fracture of a sea ice cover due to compressive and\ntensile failure under the action of wind stress, and we will\nclosely follow this paper\u2019s methodology, where details about\nthe model can be found. The model parameters used are\nsummarized in Table 1. In particular the elastic modulus and\nPoisson ratio are around the values given by Evans and\nUntersteiner [1971]. The ice pack is 400 km in size and\nconsists of a tiling of typically 4 km wide ice floes whose\nshape is produced by a Voronoi tessellation. Initially the\nfloes are connected by frozen joints with a viscous\u2010elastic\nrheology. The mean thickness of the floes is 3 m and the new\nice thickness determining the compressive strength of the\njoints between the floes is 0.25 m. The floes are considered to\nbe rigid and any deformation at the joints is determined by\nmutual motion of the adjacent edges of neighboring floes.\nThe joints can sustain compressive, tensile and shear forces.\nIt is assumed that the mutual floe displacement d = (dn, ds)\n(normal and tangential to the joint, Figure 1) is distributed\nover the whole floe average length L so that the normal and\nshear stresses at a joint are given by\n\u0001n \u00bc hE\u0003nL \u0002 kn\u0003n; \u00f01\u00de\n\u0001s \u00bc hG\u0003sL \u0002 ks\u0003s; \u00f02\u00de\nwhere E is the compressive elastic modulus, G = E\/[2(1 + n)]\nis the shear modulus where n is Poisson\u2019s ratio, and h is the\nmean ice thickness. Note that kn\/ks = 2(1 + n). The elastic\nstress is combined with a viscous stress, included to damp\nelastic waves and model inelasticity of the ice. Hopkins et al.\n[2004] used only tensile and compressive failure regimes of\nthe joints. The compressive failure stress (strength) sc is\nbased on unconfined buckling [Kovacs and Sodhi, 1980],\n\u0001c \u00bc \u00031285h3=2min kPa m \u00bc \u0003160:625 kPa m; \u00f03\u00de\nfor hmin = 0.25 m.\n[7] The model also requires imposing a tensile strength at\na joint, st which should already account for the joint\nthickness hmin. Laboratory experiments by Richter\u2010Menge\nand Jones [1993] showed that sea ice tensile strength sig-\nnificantly depends on temperature and porosity and can vary\nfrom 0.2 MPa at \u22123\u00b0C up to 0.78 MPa at \u221220\u00b0C. Dempsey et\nal. [1999] considered a crack propagation experiment on a\nblock of ice 0.5\u201380 m wide and concluded that the tensile\nstrength depends on this floe scale as 0.59\/(1 + L\/0.26)1\/2\nMPa and could range from 0.05 MPa for an 80 m wide floe\nup to 0.5 MPa for a 0.5 m wide floe. This shows a high\nsensitivity of the ice tensile strength to its temperature and\nstructure, e.g., crack density, without knowing which such\nidealized experimental results cannot directly be applied to\nour model. Assuming only one crack per joint (typically\n4 km long) would determine only the lower limit of 5.5 kPa\nfor the tensile strength. During the Sea Ice Mechanics Ini-\ntiative study on a 1.42 m thick floe, Lewis and Richter\u2010\nMenge [1998] recorded tensile stresses up to 80 kPa. Weiss\nand Schulson [2007] plotted stresses recorded during SHE-\nBA expedition and found the largest tensile stresses to be\n50 kPa, which would determine st = 12.5 kPa m for hmin =\n0.25 m. For our standard case scenario we choose the\ntensile failure stress (strength) of the joints st to be 10\ntimes smaller than the compressive strength as this pro-\nduces block shapes similar to those usually observed.\nHowever, we also perform simulations in which we vary\nthe tensile strength between 0.1 and 1 times the com-\npression strength, which includes the median value of\nRichter\u2010Menge and Jones [1993]. We relate the compres-\nsive and tensile strengths through a parameter r, st = \u2212rsc,\nnot because there is any physical evidence of a linear\ndependence between the compressive and tensile strengths,\nbut because, as will be seen from our calculations, the ratio\nFigure 1.

[2004] as the\nmutual floe displacement increases, the joint stress increases\nproportionally, and when the stress reaches the failure stress,\nthe joint starts to fail. As the displacement increases further,\nthe stress decreases (weakens) linearly until it reaches zero\nand a crack is formed locally. When a crack extends beyond\n95% of the joint length, the joint fails. After this the floe\nedges can separate forming a lead or overlap making a ridge\nwith the ridging force determined by Hopkins [1994] as F =\n928hmin\n2 l + 26126hmin (in N per meter along the ridge),\nwhere l is the length of ice pushed into the ridge.\n[9] The ice sliding friction coefficient is taken here as 0.32\nas was shown by several meter scale rafting experiments\n[Hopkins and Tuhkuri, 1999]. This value of the sliding\ncoefficient is smaller than the static coefficient of friction\nfound by Schulson et al. [2006] over a Coulombic fault,\nwhere the typical values were in the range 0.7\u20130.9. How-\never, the latter were measured on a scale which is small in\ncomparison with the floe scale, and we expect small\u2010scale\nanomalies to reduce due to abrasion and their effect to be\nless prominent. Indeed, Schulson et al. [2006] state that their\nmeasured static coefficient of friction is greater than the\nkinetic coefficient of friction. Several meter scale floe edge\nsliding experiments also gave values between 0.3 and 0.4 at\nvelocities when no stick and slip behavior occurred\n[Lishman et al., 2009]. Generally, the sliding coefficient is\nexpected to play a role only when there is significant in-\nterblock sliding, whereas during initial failure of the sea ice\ncover, which is studied here, its variation was shown by\nHopkins and Thorndike [2006] not to produce any signifi-\ncant effect.\n[10] Here we incorporate a simple model of shear rupture\ninto the discrete element model. Based on laboratory derived\nfractural failure stress envelopes [Schulson and Nickolayev,\n1995; Schulson, 2001; Schulson et al., 2006], we assume\nthat shear rupture occurs when the tangential (shear) com-\nponent ss of the traction along a joint reaches the Coulomb\nlimit (Figure 2),\nj\u0001sj \u00bc \u0004 \u0001t \u0003 \u0001n\u00f0 \u00de; \u0001n > \u0001c; \u0001n \u0004 \u0001t; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere sn is the normal component of the traction at the\njoint, and m is the shear rupture coefficient. Generally m is\nnot the slope of the failure envelope expressed in the co-\nordinates of standard stress invariants sI and sII, but if we\nassume that the stress components along the lead (which are\nnot determined in the model) and across the leads are equal\n(i.e., sss = snn, ssn = sns), then m becomes the same as the\nslope of the failure envelope in sI, sII coordinates and the\nresults of Schulson et al. [2006] imply\n\u0004 \u00bc q\u0003 1\nq\u00fe 1 ; q \u00bc \u0004\n2\ni \u00fe 1\n\u0001 \u00031=2\u00fe\u0004i\nh i2\n; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere mi is the coefficient of internal friction. Based on\nstress failure envelopes Schulson et al. [2006] obtained\nmean values q = 3.48 at \u22123\u00b0C and q = 5.69 at \u221210\u00b0C which\ncorrespond to m = 0.55 and 0.7, respectively. For our cal-\nculation we will use a value of 0.6 and also show results as it\nvaries between 0.4 and 1.\n[11] The shear rupture criterion (4) assumes a linear\nCoulomb curve for all shear stresses. Such extension of the\nlinear Coulomb curve until the sn axis itself is crossed at a\npositive tensile joint strength st is a mathematical conve-\nnience which leads to collapsing of the common tensile\nfailure truncation onto only one point of zero shear stress at\nthe tip of the envelope (sn = st). In this case, the value of\ntensile strength st is linearly proportional to the cohesive\nstrength (the value of ss at sn = 0) through the shear rupture\ncoefficient for the Coulomb failure curve assumed. Ana-\nlyzing SHEBA stress data Weiss and Schulson [2007]\nshowed that the tensile failure strength, which determines\nthe tensile stress truncation, occurs at about 0.8st, and to this\nlevel of numerical approximation the value of st can be\nassociated with tensile failure integrated over the joint\nthickness.\n[12] Rearranging (4) we see that given a shear traction\ncomponent ss, the normal traction component determining\nshear rupture is\n\u0001n \u00bc \u0001t \u0003 1\n\u0004\nj\u0001sj \u0002 \u0001*t : \u00f06\u00de\nThus the presence of the shear traction effectively modifies\nthe tensile strength to s*t. Note that for high\u2010shear traction\ncomponents s*t can become compressive (negative).\nEquation (6) determines a similar relationship between the\nnormal and shear displacements in shear rupture\n\u0003*t \u00bc\n\u0001t\nkn\n\u0003 ks\n\u0004kn\nj\u0003sj: \u00f07\u00de\nA joint starts to fail in regions where either the compressive\nor modified tensile strengths are reached (Figure 1) but the\nmodified tensile strength depends upon the shear traction at\nthe joint and is found at every time step. As it is difficult to\nimplement simultaneous weakening for normal and shear\nstresses consistently when the normal floe displacement\nexceeds d*t, we do not incorporate stress weakening and\nassume in this paper that a crack forms where the elastic\nstresses reach the failure stresses sc or s*t.\n[13] The model starts from an initial configuration of\nfloes at rest. The sea ice pack then undergoes deformation\nunder the action of a gradient of wind stress t, with stress\nFigure 2.

The effect of subtracting 12Ld from the position\nvector is to make the wind drag symmetrical about the\ncenter of the domain. The action of the wind drag force\ngives rise to a momentum contribution aligned with the\nforce. If the ice pack is homogenous, the linear variation\nof the wind force leads to the same mutual displacement\nof all the floes and to a homogenous stress distribution.\nBoundary effects are minimized by calculating the aver-\nage stress in the central region and applying it to the\nboundaries every 10 s.

Simulations and Discussion\n[14] In the following subsections we present simulations\nof the break up of the sea ice cover into blocks, or floe\naggregates. We analyze and discuss these simulations,\nfocusing on which failure mechanisms dominate, the\nFigure 3. Ice cover for different wind speeds under uniaxial compression.

Uniaxial Compression With Variation in Wind\nStress\n[15] We consider a uniaxial compressive wind stress\nalong axis x, i.e., the only nonzero component of e is exx = 1.\nThe wind speeds Uwind considered were 3.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5\nand 15 m s\u22121, which correspond to the wind drag gradients\nof 4.87 \u00b7 10\u22128, 1.8 \u00b7 10\u22127, 4.05 \u00b7 10\u22127, 7.2 \u00b7 10\u22127, 1.13 \u00b7 10\u22126\nand 1.62 \u00b7 10\u22126 Pa m\u22121. For each wind speed the model was\nrun until an established ice block configuration had devel-\noped. From the plots of the ice field (Figure 3) it can be seen\nthat the ice cover splits into blocks that are on average\nelongated along the x axis. The simulation result for Uwind =\n3.5 m s\u22121 especially clearly shows the roughly diamond\nshape of the blocks. The blocks themselves are permeated\nby cracks. The model does not include crack refreezing, and\nsome of the cracks could be expected in reality to freeze\nover, especially those lying within the blocks. From histo-\ngrams showing the distribution of block\u2010delineating crack\nlength with regard to angle for different values of the shear\nrupture coefficient m (Figure 4) we see that the cracks are\ndistributed bimodally around the critical flaw angle in wing\u2010\ncrack formation [Jaeger and Cook, 1979; Ashby and\nHallam, 1986; Schulson, 2004],\ntan 2\u0007\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1=\u0004: \u00f010\u00de\nThe maxima, however, are not very prominent, presum-\nably due to the limited number of discrete angles deter-\nmined by the floe edges, along which the critical flaw can\nonly form.\n[16] It should be noted that the crack angle is determined\nby the shear rupture coefficient m rather than the sliding\ncoefficient k. Equation (10) was derived by considering\nfailure of brittle ice when flaws are present. In this case the\nresistance to shear at the flaw comes from friction and it is\nthe coefficient of internal friction that should enter (10). In\nour model, however, the joint stretches elastically until the\nfailure stress is attained. Right before the joint failure,\nresistance to shearing deformation at the joint coming from\nits elastic stress is effectively given by the shear failure\nstress determined by the shear rupture coefficient, so that the\nlatter naturally determines the critical flaw angle (10).\n3.1.1. Block Size Distribution\n[17] As the block size becomes smaller with increasing\nwind speed (Figure 5), the block shapes become more\nerratic as their perimeter is delineated by a relatively small\nnumber of joints. This is because the small number of joints\nprevent the cracks from propagating in certain directions.\nSimilar to Hopkins and Thorndike [2006] in Figure 6 we\nshow a cumulative block area distribution function\nFA A\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc NAd\nZ 1\nA\nP A\u00f0 \u00dedA; Ad \u00bc L2d ; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere P(A) is the probability distribution function of num-\nber of blocks with regard to their area A, and N is the\nnumber of blocks within the domain. FA(A) describes the\nnumber of blocks whose area is not smaller than A and\ngenerally it looks similar to those found by Hopkins and\nThorndike [2006]. The most interesting feature is a similar\npower law distribution for areas less than 300 km2. How-\never, our results differ as our slope is around \u22121, while\nHopkins and Thorndike [2006] obtained \u22120.68. Other ob-\nservations show \u22120.65 [Rothrock and Thorndike, 1984], or a\nrange of \u22120.5 to \u22120.9 [Weiss, 2003], or \u22120.65 and \u22120.77\n[Weiss and Marsan, 2004].\n[18] It is difficult to exactly determine the reason for the\npower law for block area as well as the difference between\nour result and that of Hopkins and Thorndike [2006]. Weiss\nand Marsan [2004] considered a general multifractal model\nto explain the scale invariance. A power law distribution of\nice floe area can be a result of self\u2010similarity such as in the\nFigure 4.

The bin width is 3\u00b0, and the\nresults are averaged over 10 different initial Voronoi tessellations. The imposed wind speed ranges\nfrom 3.5 to 5 m s\u22121 for different m to ensure the block size is of order 40 km. The cracks are filtered\nas described in Figure 3. The dotted lines show the critical flaw angle in the wing crack theory\ndetermined by tan(2\u0007) = 1\/m [Jaeger and Cook, 1979; Ashby and Hallam, 1986; Schulson, 2004].\nFigure 5.

The standard deviation is derived from mean block\nsize for 10 different ice field configurations. Blocks 10 times\nsmaller than the average floe area are filtered out.\nWILCHINSKY ET AL.: SEA ICE SHEAR RUPTURE C10002C10002\n5 of 13\nApollonian gasket [Rothrock and Thorndike, 1984]. We, in\nturn, want to focus on the physics of the process, and con-\nsider a very idealized model that could give us some hints\non the nature of our block size distribution. The power law\ndistribution is observed at scales less than the mean block\nsizes (Figure 5), and is effectively independent of the wind\nstress gradient, apart from the case of Uwind = 3.5 m s\n\u22121\n(Figure 6), where the difference probably comes from the\nblock size approaching the domain size.\n[19] Hopkins et al. [2004] showed that the size of large\nblocks is determined by the wind stress gradient inducing\nelastic stress accumulation leading to failure. This will be\ndiscussed in more detail in the following subsection. Since\nthe small block size distribution does not depend on the\nwind stress gradient (Figure 6), we assume that the smaller\nblocks do not form under the direct action of the wind stress,\nbut rather through the force exerted on their sides by the\nlarger blocks, which leads to the production of damage\nzones. We illustrate this in Figure 7 where a large block\nexerts a force F on a side of a region of frozen floes of size\nD. For simplicity we consider the same failure regime for all\nthe joints. The force is transmitted across the region through\nthe elastic joints, therefore in order for any of the elastic\njoints to fail all surrounding joints should also approach the\nsame failure strength, e.g., sc in compression. Therefore\nfailure of a block of area A would require work linearly\nproportional to the area A itself. In this case, failure of the\nregion shown in Figure 7 through formation of blocks of\nsize L or just one block of size D requires the same work,\nwhile there will be AD\/AL times more blocks of size L than\nD, where Ad = D\n2 and AL = L\n2. Since the formation of a\nblock of the floe length L would require AD\/AL less energy\nthan formation of a block of size D, we shall assume that the\nformation of a block of area AL is AD\/AL times more likely\nthan formation of a block of area AD. This leads us to\nconclude that the probability density function of block\nnumber must satisfy P(AL) = (AD\/AL)\n2 P(AD), which, after\nintegration, leads to FA \/ A\u22121 in correspondence with our\nsimulations. It is now necessary to note that under uniaxial\ncompression our model with shear failure produces a two\u2010\ndimensional failure pattern, while if only compressive fail-\nure is modeled (as in the work of Hopkins and Thorndike\n[2006]), a one\u2010dimensional failure pattern is produced, as\nwill be seen in subsection 3.2. In a two\u2010dimensional failure\nregime, the whole force F can be transmitted onto one small\nFigure 6. The accumulated block size distribution, FA (A)\nfor different wind speeds. The curves are averaged over 10\ndifferent configurations.\nFigure 7. An idealized sea ice area of size D broken up\ninto blocks of size L.\nFigure 8.

The bin size is 0.1. The\ndashed line shows the dr values of (15) determining the\nminimum failure energy. The imposed wind speed ranges\nfrom 3.5 to 5 m s\u22121 for different m to ensure the block size is\nof order 40 km. The presence of cracks due to compressive\nfailure gives rise to a singular large value of the distribution\nfunction at the first histogram bin (dr = \u22121), whose value is\nshown as f(\u22121). The cracks are filtered as described in\nFigure 3.\nWILCHINSKY ET AL.: SEA ICE SHEAR RUPTURE C10002C10002\n6 of 13\nblock only, whereas in a one\u2010dimensional regime only the\nforce (L\/D)F will be transmitted to any one particular\nblock. We account for this by postulating that when the\nfailure regime is one\u2010dimensional, the smaller block is D\/L\nless likely to fail than when the failure regime is two\u2010\ndimensional. In this case P(AD) = (AD\/AL)\n3\/2 P(AD), which\ndetermines FA \/ A\u22121\/2 which is closer to the result of\nHopkins and Thorndike [2006].\n3.1.2. Block Size Evaluation\n[20] We follow Hopkins et al. [2004] to obtain a rough\nestimate of the block size under a uniaxial compressive wind\nstress. While Hopkins et al. [2004] considered a one\ndimensional model under divergence, our failure pattern and\nthe flow motion involved are two\u2010dimensional and more\ncomplicated. In particular, as there is no confining stress,\nunder a uniaxial compressive stress gradient the floes are\nexpected to move perpendicular to the compression direc-\ntion since the floe edges are inclined with respect to the\ncompression direction. Regardless of the direction of motion\nwe estimate the floe speed as u = \u2223t\u2223t\/(rih) and the relative\nfloe displacement with the typical floe size of L as\n\u0003 \u00bc jr\u0005 jL\n2\u0006ih\nt2; \u00f012\u00de\nwhere \u2223rt\u2223 = 0.0024raUwind2 \/Ld.

Figure 8 shows\nhistograms of the normalized crack length distribution\nduring joint failure against dr from which it can be seen\nthat the most probable shear rupture regime is determined\nby minimizing the failure energy Wf. This failure regime\ninvolves a tensile shear rupture of the joints through local\nopening at wing cracks.

Therefore as m decreases the joint failure energy\nof an arbitrary failure mode differs less from the mini-\nmum failure energy, which makes it likelier for the\nfailure mode to deviate from the minimum energy regime.\nThis leads to the histogram peaks smoothing out as m\ndecreases.\n[21] It follows from the simulations presented above that\nthe minimum energy failure mode could be used as the\ntypical failure mode of shear rupture, at least for zero con-\nfinement.

The number of blocks accounted for as the wind\nspeed approaches 15 m s\u22121 also decreases, as more and\nmore blocks are split by incidental damage of a small\nnumber of joints and get filtered out.\n3.2. Uniaxial Compression With Variation in Tensile\nStrength\n[22] The ratio of the minimum shear rupture energy (14)\nto the corresponding compressive failure energy Wc =\nkndc\n2 \/ 2 is\nWf\nWc\n\u00bc r2 2 1\u00fe \b\u00f0 \u00de\u0004\n2\n1\u00fe 2 1\u00fe \b\u00f0 \u00de\u00042 ; \u00f023\u00de\nwhere r = dt\/\u2223dc\u2223 is the normalized tensile strength. As the\nnormalized tensile strength increases, the compressive\nfailure energy Wc (being 200 times larger than the mini-\nmum shear rupture energy Wf at r = 0.1) gradually be-\ncomes comparable with Wf and in particular Wf \/Wc =\n0.08, 0.24 and 0.48 for r = 0.4, 0.7 and 1, respectively.\nSince uniaxial compression is considered, as r increases\nshear rupture becomes harder to attain, hence compressive\nfailure gradually starts to prevail: the fraction of the total\ncrack length due to compressive failure g becomes 0.07,\n0.29, 0.54 and 0.71 for r = 0.1, 0.4, 0.7 and 1, respec-\ntively. From the simulation results for the ice field failure\n(Figure 10) it can be seen that the block size increases\nwith r. The failure regime (dr) histogram (Figure 11)\nshows that failure occurs through the compressive regime\nFigure 13. The normalized block size (square root of the\nblock area divided by Lb\ns ) for varying r under uniaxial\ncompression.

The estimated block size due to shear rupture only\nis Lb\ns is 19.5, 27.6, 31.8, and 43.7 km for the relative ten-\nsile strength r = 0.1, 0.4, 0.7, and 1, respectively. The\nnormalized length scale Lb\nm with a = 1.6 is shown by\nthe dotted line.\nFigure 14. Ice cover for different confinement ratios Rc. Snap shots with Rc = 0.8 and 1 are similar to\nthat of Rc = 0.6. No filtering was applied.

From the crack orientation distribution\n(Figure 12) it can also be seen that as the normalized tensile\nstrength increases, the failure angle distribution has three\nlocal maxima: two at the usual critical flaw angle in wing\ncrack formation, and one perpendicular to the compression\ndirection. Since at r = 0.1 the blocks consist of a relatively\nsmall number of floes, and there is less possibility for cracks\nto propagate along a specific direction, the angle distribution\nis almost uniform in this case. As the block size increases\nthe local maxima in the angle distribution become more\npronounced.\n[23] The block size normalized by the shear rupture scale Lb\ns\nversus r is shown in Figure 13. The low values of standard\ndeviation in the block size show consistency in the block\nsize formation. The normalized block size increases as r\nincreases. The blocks become elongated perpendicular to\nthe compression direction as the compressive failure mode\nbecomes dominant (as r increases). Due to the high\nanisotropy of the blocks it is difficult to estimate the block\nsize rigorously, and we will consider a very simple model.\nThe length scale during compressive failure derived by\nHopkins et al. [2004] takes the following modified form\nLcb \u00bc\n\u0001cL2\n8r\u0005\n\u0004 \u00051=4\n: \u00f024\u00de\n(The reason this expression is slightly different from that\nin the work of Hopkins et al. [2004] is that we ignore\nstrain weakening in this paper.) As the tensile strength\nincreases, compressive failure perpendicular to the com-\npression direction becomes dominant, so that the maxi-\nmum block scale along the compression direction is given\nby the compressive failure scale above. If we assume that\nthe shear failure angle \u0007 is determined by (10) then the\nmean angle of crack propagation would be \t = (1 \u2212 g) \u0007 +\ngp\/2, where g is the compressive failure fraction discussed\nabove. The across compression direction block scale can\nthen be found as Lb\na = Lb\nc tan \t, which determines the\nsought length scale of the blocks as the square root of the\narea of a rhombus with semiaxis lengths Lb\nc and Lb\na:Lb\nm =\na(Lb\naLb\na\/2)1\/2, where a accounts for irregularity of both\ncompressive failure, which could be expected to lead to a\npositive correction to (24) as was found by Hopkins et al.\n[2004], as well as the block shape, which could be more\nconvex than a rhombus due to a nonuniform distribution\nof compressive and shear failure perpendicular to the\ncompression direction, as can be seen from Figure 10.\nThe normalized values of this block scale Lb\nm\/Lb\ns with\na = 1.6 are presented in Figure 13 as a dashed line.\nIt can be seen that for r \u2264 0.4 the block size is properly\ndescribed by the shear rupture scale Lb\ns as the block size\nis mainly determined by the shear rupture mechanism. As\nthe normalized tensile strength r increases, despite some\nquantitative difference, the found block size scale Lb\nm\ndescribes the block length change rather well. Increasing\nof r beyond unity was not considered as this would make\nthe block length become comparable with the domain\nsize.\nFigure 15.

Confinement Ratio Variation Under Compression\n[24] Here we fix the wind stress gradient along axis x and\nvary the compressive stress in the perpendicular direction\nalong axis y. The confinement ratio Rc is the ratio between\nthe principal wind stress gradients components, Rc = rtyy\/\nrtxx = eyy\/exx, so that the stress gradient variation comes\nfrom imposing eyy = Rc, exx = 1 in (8). We consider our\nstandard case scenario of the tensile strength being 10 times\nsmaller than the compressive strength (r = 0.1). From the ice\nfield snap shots in Figure 14 it can be seen that within 0.2 <\nRc < 0.4 the sea ice failure regime changes: at Rc = 0.2 the\nfailure mode is similar to that of uniaxial compression where\nthe primary failure direction is determined by wing\u2010crack\nformation (Figure 15) whereas for Rc \u2265 0.4 the sea ice cover\neffectively breaks down into floes with only occasional\nblocks remaining. In this latter case (Rc > 0.4), if the wind\nstress is reduced, then no ice field failure occurs, so that the\nice block size cannot be increased by decreasing the wind\nstress as is in the case for smaller confinement ratios.\n[25] In our model a joint breaks in shear rupture at a shear\ntraction linearly dependent on the normal traction, similar to\na Coulomb\u2019s friction criterion. Shear rupture will be sup-\npressed if the confinement ratio between the large\u2010scale\nstresses reaches a level where the effective shear stress\nacross any direction becomes zero [e.g., Schulson, 2001;\nJaeger and Cook, 1979],\nR*c \u00bc\n\u00042 \u00fe 1\u00f0 \u00de1=2\u0003\u0004\n\u00042 \u00fe 1\u00f0 \u00de1=2\u00fe\u0004\n: \u00f025\u00de\nFor m = 0.6 used in our model R*c = 0.32 which corresponds\nto our numerical results. As the confinement ratio exceeds\nR*c the failure mode changes. From Figure 15 it can be seen\nthat failure starts to occur at arbitrary angles with only a\nslight bias to the y direction along which compressive failure\nis easiest. However Figure 16 shows that the failure mode at\njoints is mainly due to shear rupture with the most probable\nfailure regime determined by the minimum failure energy\n(15) requiring local divergence. When R*c is exceeded, the\nlarge\u2010scale wind stress pattern cannot ensure large\u2010scale\nshear failure anymore. As the wind stress increases, the\ncompressive strength is still too high to induce any signifi-\ncant failure. However, the irregularity of the floes ensures\nlocal shear stress (along the joints) which eventually makes\nsea ice failure possible locally, so that the ice field breaks up\ninto floes.\n[26] If the tensile strength increases (Figure 17) under a\nhomogeneous compressive wind stress gradient (confine-\nment ratio of unity), shear rupture becomes more difficult to\nattain, and the fraction of compressive failure increases from\n12% at r = 0.1 to 17%, 44%, 48% and 60% for r = 0.3, 0.5,\n0.7 and 0.9, respectively. The shear rupture regime is again\ndetermined by the minimum failure energy (not shown)\nsimilar to other cases with dr = 0.145, 0.242 and 0.338\ndetermining the minimum for r = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. The block\nsize normalized by the shear rupture scale Lf\ns increases with\nr (Figure 18) as the compressive failure determining a larger\nblock scale becomes more important. For a small normal-\nized tensile failure r, the block size is smaller than that given\nby the shear rupture estimate (22) even though the failure\nregime is mainly shear. This, we believe, is caused by the\nfact that while in the case of uniaxial compression the shear\nrupture work is supplied by the shear elastic strain energy, in\nthe case of uniform convergence the shear\u2010regime failure\nFigure 17.

From\nFigure 19 it can be seen that during uniaxial compression\nboth normal and shear strain energy (calculated as work\ndone by elastic deformation over all joint segments that\nremain unbroken) grow until failure starts, and during fail-\nure they both decrease contributing to normal and shear\nrupture energies that, in turn, grow. In uniform compression\nthe normal strain energy mainly grows, however after failure\nboth normal and shear rupture energies (given by (14)\nintegrated over all broken joint segments) increase, simi-\nlarly to the uniaxial compression case. This implies that part\nof the normal strain energy is converted into shear rupture\nenergy. The normal strain energy is higher than the shear\nstrain energy. Therefore if a higher normal strain energy rate\nis accounted for instead of the lower shear\u2010failure strain rate\nin (23), then the block size scale would be smaller.\n4. Conclusions\n[27] A Coulomb shear rupture mechanism for crack for-\nmation similar to that found in the laboratory [Schulson and\nNickolayev, 1995] was incorporated into the sea ice discrete\nelement model of Hopkins et al. [2004]. The original model\nincluded only compressive and tensile failure of interfloe\njoints and produced predominantly rectilinear\u2010shaped floe\naggregates, which is in contrast to many observations of\ndiamond\u2010shaped floe aggregates in the Arctic. As wind\nexerts drag on the floes, the floes move and their displace-\nment leads to accumulation of elastic strain energy in the\nconnecting viscous elastic joints. The mutual floe dis-\nplacement is roughly uniform if the wind stress gradient is\nconstant. The shear strength is related to a particular amount\nof mutual floe displacement tangential to the edge and is\nlinearly dependent on the elastic force normal to the edge. In\nparticular, a compressive normal elastic force suppresses\nshear rupture. When the stress reaches the compressive,\ntensile or shear strengths, local failure occurs and a crack is\ninitiated. Further increase in the elastic strain energy is\nconverted into crack propagation, delineating floe ag-\ngregates of a size determined by competition between the\nrate of crack propagation and the elastic relaxation wave\nspeed. In all cases considered here it has been found that\nwhile there is a large degree of variability in shear rupture\nregimes, the most probable scenario is that when the mini-\nmum failure energy is attained, which involves local open-\ning. This minimum failure work was used in our aggregate\nsize evaluation.\n[28] In our standard case scenario we consider a tensile\nstrength 10 times smaller than the compressive strength. In\nthis case, when the wind stress describes uniaxial com-\npression, the ice field breaks up into elongated aggregates\ndelineated by cracks with a bimodal maxima distribution at\nangles determined by the critical flaw angle in the wing\ncrack theory, tan(2\u0007) = 1\/m. The aggregates are roughly\ndiamond shaped and are surrounded by smaller floes in\ndamage zones. As the wind stress gradient increases, the\nelastic strain energy grows faster leading to a quicker crack\npropagation speed per unit area, and consequently smaller\ngenerated ice block sizes. At the same time the blocks\nbecome less anisotropic as their size becomes comparable\nwith the floe size so that there are fewer available floe\njoints for the crack to propagate along. The aggregate scale\nfound based on minimum failure work agrees with the\nblock size found from simulations. Similar to Hopkins and\nThorndike [2006] and different observations [Rothrock and\nThorndike, 1984; Weiss, 2003; Weiss and Marsan, 2004]\nour model produces a power law distribution of smaller\u2010\nsize ice block numbers versus their area. A simple model\nthat associates the energy necessary to form a block to the\nprobability of finding it could explain the power exponent.\n[29] As the tensile strength increases relative to the com-\npressive strength under uniaxial compressive wind stress,\nthe block size increases as shear rupture becomes harder to\nattain and compressive failure becomes more important,\ndetermining a higher failure energy and slower crack\npropagation speed per unit area. The generated ice blocks\nalso become elongated perpendicular to the compression\ndirection as the emerging compressive failure is more likely\nacross the compressive direction. The typical aggregate size\nin this case is estimated by assuming that the length scale\nalong the compressive direction is determined by compres-\nsive failure, while the length scale across the compression\ndirection is determined by the mean failure angle. The mean\nblock size as a square root of the product of these length\nscales then suitably describes the simulated aggregate size as\nthe tensile strength approaches the compressive strength.\n[30] If in the standard case scenario the confinement ratio\nof the wind stress gradient increases, the failure mode\nchanges when the confinement ratio is between 0.2 and 0.4,\nFigure 19. The stored elastic strain energy normal to the joints (solid line) and tangential to the joints\n(dashed line) versus time for a particular ice field configuration shown in Figures 3 and 14. The accu-\nmulated failure (elastic) energy normal to the joint (dot\u2010dashed line) and tangential to the joints (dotted\nline) are also shown for comparison.

Below this range\nthe failure occurs similar to the uniaxial compression case,\nwhere diamond\u2010shaped aggregates are produced. Above this\nrange the ice field starts to fail isotropically since the Cou-\nlomb failure criterion cannot be attained on the large scale.\nLocal stress anomalies arising due to the irregularity of the\nfloes lead to shear rupture of the ice field with block sizes\nsmaller than that predicted by the shear rupture estimates.\nWe argue that this is due to conversion of a higher, normal\nstrain energy to shear rupture energy. As the tensile strength\nincreases, compressive failure become more prevalent and\nthe aggregate size increases.\n[31] Our simulations have shown that shear rupture is an\nimportant factor in determining sea ice block shape and size.\nThe observed diamond shape of the blocks can be produced\nby low confinement ratio wind stress patterns if sea ice\ntensile strength is much smaller than the compressive\nstrength. When the confinement ratio increases, the blocks\nbecome isotropic. When the tensile strength increases, the\nblock shape also changes becoming elongated across the\nuniaxial compression direction. While the tensile strength of\nsea ice is still ambiguous, results of our, albeit idealized,\nsimulations show that in order for the diamond shape\nstructures to exist, the tensile strength should be much\nsmaller than the compressive strength.\n[32] Acknowledgment.
