Introduction\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a medical imaging technique employing low-coherence\ninterferometry to image the morphology of biological tissue or non-biological semi-transparent composite\nmaterials. Illumination wavelengths in the visible and near infra red regions of the spectrum, are strongly\nscattered by tissue, limiting the maximum imaging depth to about 1 mm1. However, the depth resolution,\nranging from about 1 \uf06dm in ultra-high resolution systems to around 30 \uf06dm, is superior to that achieved by\nother tomographic methods such as ultrasound, enabling cell-level detail to be observed in the highest\nresolution systems2. OCT is therefore of interest for both in-vitro and in-vivo investigations of epithelial\ntissues3, 4. Its ability to perform \u2018optical biopsy\u2019 gives it the potential to replace, or at least to reduce the\nnecessity for, invasive screening by excision of tissue samples5.\nLaboratory testing can be conveniently performed using bulk-optic OCT instrumentation, but the acquisition\nof in-vivo images, typically from within the gastro-intestinal tract, requires the use of a flexible, endoscopic\nprobe. This is realized by incorporating optical fibre components. In early systems, the typical configuration\ncomprised a Michelson interferometer formed from a directional coupler6. Until recently, time-domain\nimplementations have predominated. In time-domain OCT, broadband illumination is used, and the path-\nlength of the reference arm is scanned to locate occurrences of the coherence function at a series of sample\ndepths. Optical circulators and balanced detection are now generally used to optimize performance in these\nsystems. The time-domain technique is, however, gradually being superseded by Fourier-domain OCT,\nwhich offers superior signal-to-noise performance. In Fourier-domain OCT, the full sample depth is\n2addressed simultaneously, the signal beam being dispersed into a sequence of spectral components which\ncarry the structural information.\nThe majority of bulk and fibre-based OCT systems currently under investigation are based around a\nMichelson interferometer configuration. This allows an instrument to be constructed using relatively few\ncomponents and provides good signal-to-noise performance7. However, optical fibre versions of the\nMichelson configuration are susceptible to signal fading caused by bending-induced differences between the\nstates of polarization (SOP) of light in the reference and signal arms8. This is evidently more likely to be a\nproblem during in-vivo measurements. Phase drifting of the fringes, caused by temperature fluctuations, is\nalso likely under these conditions. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that, for fibre-based\nOCT systems, the Michelson interferometer configuration may not always be the optimum choice. An\nalternative Fizeau interferometer configuration offers the advantage of down-lead insensitivity9,10. Discussion\nof our current Fizeau OCT system has been previously reported11.\nThe usual procedure in OCT is to scan the position of the focused probe beam rapidly across the sample\nsurface (x-y scanning) to build up a 3D map of tissue structure12. In this paper, we discuss the use of a\ncoherent fibre bundle, sometimes known as an imaging bundle, to acquire 3-dimensional volume information\nwithout the need for x-y scanning13, 14. The fibres within a coherent bundle are arranged in a regular array\nthroughout the entire length of up to several metres15. An image projected onto one polished end of the\nbundle is thus transmitted undistorted to the opposite end. In the bundle-based OCT system, reciprocal\nimaging occurs between the distal end of each fibre in the bundle and the sample, enabling OCT information\nto be transmitted simultaneously from many positions across the area of the sample illuminated by light from\nthe bundle. Detection of the optical signal over the area addressed by the bundle is performed by a digital\ncamera array, allowing a 3D image to be constructed from a single depth scan.\n2. Time-domain OCT\nOur full-field experimental systems to date have used time-domain processing. Broadband illumination was\nsupplied by super-luminescent diode (SLD) sources at 830 nm. Optimum wavelengths for tissue are those in\nthe range 1000-1550 nm, where absorption of light by the tissue is at its lowest16. However, for full-field\nmeasurements, silicon technology cameras are much more readily available, with sensitivity in the visible\nand very near IR, hence the choice of 830 nm wavelength during development of the new technique.\nThe structure that appears in an OCT signal results from refractive index discontinuities at boundaries\nbetween tissue structures. In a time-domain system, illumination is provided by a broadband non-laser\ndevice. The output spectrum should be as broad as possible, since depth resolution is determined by the\ncoherence length, which is inversely related to source spectral width. For a typical super-luminescent source,\nthe spectral width is about 20-100 nm, resulting in a coherence length (and depth resolution) of 10-20 \uf06dm. A\ntypical single-spot scanned OCT system consists of a Michelson interferometer in which the reference and\nsample arms are of closely similar length, as shown in figure 1.\nDetector\nDirectional\ncoupler\nBBS Sample\nOptical\nDelay line\nFigure 1. Michelson-configuration OCT system, based on a directional coupler. BBS = broad band source.\n3The reference arm includes a variable optical delay line, enabling the reference beam path to be swept\nlinearly over a range of several millimetres. For a tissue boundary at a particular depth within the sample,\ninterference fringes will be seen only when the reference beam path is set to match that of the signal beam, to\nwithin the 10-20 \uf06dm coherence length of the source. When this condition is satisfied, interference fringes are\ndetected, modulated by the source spectral envelope. Thus the positions of the various tissue boundaries can\nbe located and mapped with high resolution as the reference path is scanned.\nSpatial resolution in the plane normal to the optical axis is determined by the spot size of the focused beam\nwithin the sample, and is typically similar to the depth resolution. It is determined by the quality of the probe\nhead focusing optics.\nThe refractive indices of biological materials within a sample of plant or animal tissue are typically rather\nsimilar, often differing in only the second or third decimal place and resulting in low reflectivity values.\nBalanced detection is therefore widely used to improve SNR performance.\n3. Fizeau-configuration OCT using a coherent optical fibre bundle\nFor single-spot OCT instruments, 3D information is obtained by rapid scanning of the probe beam, both\nthrough the sample depth and in a pattern across the sample surface12. This is a reliable technique, relatively\nstraightforward to implement in bulk-optic systems, and typically allows a 3D image of a volume up to a few\ncubic millimetres to be obtained in a few seconds. However, when using this type of system endoscopically,\nfor internal in-vivo measurements, active scanning is required at the endoscope tip. Although this has been\nsuccessfully demonstrated using miniaturised components17, it requires rather sophisticated engineering,\nespecially for 3-D measurement. A passive probe, that eliminated the need for scanning, would therefore be\nadvantageous for endoscopic use.\nA coherent fibre bundle, by allowing simultaneous OCT measurement from an array of positions across the\nsample, eliminates the requirement for x-y scanning13. The bundle diameter of a few mm is suitable for\nendoscopic use and a fibre spacing as little as 6-10 \uf06dm can be obtained. The potential spatial resolution is\ntherefore similar to that obtained from an x-y scanned system.\nFibre Bundle\nSample\nSLD\nA\nCamera\nScanning\nMirror\nMirror\nL\nL\nFigure 2.

Inset circle shows where the two reflections\noccur in the Fizeau interferometer.\nSample\n4The original configuration, used for our bundle-based OCT system and shown in figure 2, is a full-field\nversion of an arrangement previously employed in our laboratory for a single-point system based on a\nFizeau-type probe interferometer. The Fizeau cavity is formed between the end face of the bundle and the\nsample itself. One related system has been described in the literature, based on a Michelson interferometer.\nAlthough this also uses a fibre imaging bundle, it does not employ simultaneous illumination14.\nPath length matching cannot be achieved directly with the Fizeau arrangement, so a scanned, bulk-optic\nprocessing interferometer is employed, having an average path-length mismatch identical to that of the\nFizeau. In the work presented here, the processing interferometer is of the Michelson type, but other\nconfigurations are possible.\nThe Fizeau arrangement was considered particularly appropriate for a bundle-based system, in that the\nbundle itself does not form part of either the sample or the processing interferometer. This gives the\ninstrument \u2018down-lead insensitivity\u2019. Environmentally-induced polarisation changes within the bundle do not\naffect the visibility of the interference signal. Because the Michelson processing interferometer uses bulk\ncomponents, polarisation changes in this section are also avoided. Polarisation-induced fading is a potential\nproblem in any non common-path interferometer, although for single-fibre systems, if not too fast, it can be\ncompensated using polarisation state controllers. In an imaging bundle the Fizeau configuration is a\nparticularly attractive option since it is likely that polarisation is affected differently by each fibre, precluding\ncompensation.\nThere are, however, disadvantages in using this arrangement, in the form of reduced SNR performance\nresulting from the high dc signal component when compared with a Michelson interferometer. The\nimplications of this problem are discussed further in section 5 below.\n4. Experimental details\nThe experiments described in this paper were performed using the configuration shown in figure 2. The\nsource was a 7 mW, 830 nm super-luminescent diode (SLD), with a bandwidth of about 15 nm,\ncorresponding to a coherence length of about 30 \uf06dm.\nLight from the source was collimated and transmitted through the processing interferometer to the input face\nof the imaging bundle, via a beam-splitter cube which allowed 50% of the returning light to be directed onto\nthe detector. A focusing lens (A), positioned after the interferometer, enabled the beam diameter to be\nadjusted to illuminate any required area of the bundle face. Because the interferometer has unequal path\nlengths in the two arms, positioning the lens before the interferometer would cause a wavefront curvature\nmismatch, resulting in bulls-eye fringes in the recombining beams. Backscattered light from the sample re-\nentered the bundle, where it combined with a reference reflection derived from the distal end of the bundle.\nThe OCT interference signal derives from mixing between sample reflections that have taken the shorter path\nin the processing interferometer, and a reference reflection that has taken the longer path in the processing\ninterferometer, respectively.\nIn the configuration shown, light passes first through the processing interferometer, then through the Fizeau\nsystem. This allows beams to be collimated through the bulk-optic section, avoiding the formation of circular\nfringes. Unexpanded beams could be used in this section if required to allow, for example, small aperture\nmodulation components to be included in the interferometer. In this case, a beam expander might be\nnecessary following the Michelson interferometer. In principle, an alternative arrangement could be\nemployed, with the processing interferometer positioned after the Fizeau interferometer. However, the\nproximal face of the bundle would then have to be imaged through each of the two interferometer arms on\nthe camera. Since the arms are of unequal length, additional optics would be required to compensate for the\nresulting magnification mismatch. It is likely that difficulties would be encountered in overlaying the two\nimages on the camera with sufficient precision to observe high quality OCT signals.\n4.1 Imaging bundles\nTwo types of fibre imaging bundle (supplied by Schott Fiber Optics Inc.) were used in this work. Initially, a\nwound bundle, 2 m in length and made up of 300x300 fibres was employed. The bundle is comprised of\n5many hundred \u201cmultifibres\u201d wound on a mandrel. The multifibres are groups of 5 x 5 individual fibres\nassembled on a 10 \uf06dm centre spacing in a square-packed arrangement, as shown in figure 3(a). The ends of\nthe bundle are fused to produce a rigid section enclosed in a ferrule, while the centre portion remains\nflexible. Bundles are purchased as a component of selected length with both ends polished to a high-quality\noptical finish.\nSubsequently, leached bundles were also investigated. These are manufactured by acid-leaching away the\nsecondary cladding material from the central region of a drawn multifibre rod, leaving rigid sections at each\nend for mounting the bundle. These bundles have the advantage of an extremely regular, hexagonal\narrangement of the component fibres (figure 3(b)), but are generally available in shorter lengths than the\nwound bundles. For most OCT applications, this would not be a problem. We found both types of bundle to\nbe appropriate for OCT imaging, having similar loss coefficients, numerical apertures and inter-fibre\nisolation characteristics.\nLight was transmitted by the bundle to a probe head comprising a pair of matched lenses positioned in a unit\nmagnification, 4f imaging arrangement. Spherical lenses were used initially, but aspherics were later\nintroduced to optimise imaging quality, since minimising aberrations across the entire image is of critical\nimportance in the bundle-based system.\n50 \uf06dm\n8 \uf06dm core\n50\n\uf06d\nm\n10 \uf06dm pixel 8 \uf06dm pixel\nFigure 3. Diagrams and photographs of illuminated bundle end faces, showing the fibre packing\narrangements for the Schott imaging bundles used in our laboratory: (a) 5 x 5 square-packed \u201cmultifibre\u201d and\nphotograph showing multifibres in a wound bundle. (b) Hexagonal packing used in the leached bundles.\nIn a single point OCT system, the beam waist diameter determines the spatial resolution of the instrument in\nthe x-y plane normal to the beam direction. Poor focusing degrades spatial resolution. In the bundle-based\nsystem, this is similarly true. However, in the full-field system there is an additional consequence of poor\nfocusing. If the beam waist diameter exceeds the fibre spacing, overlap gives rise to inter-fibre cross-talk in\nlight scattered by the sample. Non-reciprocal imaging can occur, in which backscattered light transmitted to\nthe sample by one fibre can be collected by a different fibre. Even if beam waists are well separated at best\nfocus, cross-talk will arise outside the Rayleigh range as the beams diverge.\nSince the path length in the Fizeau varies depending on which pair of neighbouring fibres are involved,\nspurious sets of interference fringes can arise at the detector. Figure 4(a) shows a plot of intensity variation\nfor four individual fibres, randomly located within an illuminated region of about 50x50 fibres, as the\nprocessing interferometer is scanned, when probe-head imaging is performed by a pair of simple plano-\nconvex lenses. Multiple fringe bursts can be seen arising from severe cross-talk. The consequences are the\nappearance of \u2018ghost\u2019 features, causing blurring of interfaces in the OCT image and degradation of both\ndepth (z) and x-y resolution. It can be seen that the precise form of the envelope function in this situation\nvaries from fibre to fibre.\nSubstitution of achromat lenses resulted in a significant improvement, although their ability to minimise\naberrations is known to decrease for off-axis object points. Aspherics performed better still. By choosing an\nappropriate aperture diameter for our system, focusing quality with aspherics confined about 90% of the\nincident power to a single fibre, with about 1-2% in each of the neighbouring fibres.\n(a) (b)\n6P\nix\nel\nin\nte\nns\nity\n\/a\nrb\nitr\nar\ny\nun\nits\nScan position\/ arbitrary units\n(a)\nP\nix\nel\nin\nte\nns\nity\n\/a\nrb\nitr\nar\ny\nun\nits\nScan position\/ arbitrary units\n(b)\nFigure 4. Intensity modulation of the signal from individual fibres in the imaging bundle as the processing\ninterferometer is scanned, when using (a) standard plano-convex and (b) aspherical lenses for focusing in the\nprobe head. The x-axis is on the same scale in each plot.\nTypically, no more than one additional pair of interference envelopes was seen to either side of a true\ninterference signal, and the magnitude of the satellite envelopes was reduced to only a few percent of the\nmain envelope. Figure 4(b) shows the intensity modulation for three individual fibres within the illuminated\nregion when aspherics replace the standard lenses in the probe head. The exact position of the envelope\nmaximum varies by a few micrometres for different fibres. This is not unexpected, as the Fizeau cavity\nlength will be dependent upon the flatness of the bundle end face and by the precision of its alignment\nparallel to the sample surface.\nBecause the bundle is external to the interferometers, any slight variation in the internal physical length or\noptical path difference for different regions of the bundle is unimportant. The numerical aperture of the fibre\nbundle, however, is large, at 0.63. Under coherent illumination from a laser, the fibres in the imaging bundle\nare seen to be capable of supporting multiple spatial modes. In principle, \u2018ghost\u2019 images could be seen for\nlight travelling to and from the measurement region in different modes, but under the coupling conditions\nused in our system, single-mode performance was achieved. The fill-factor for the wound bundle used in this\nproject, in which the basic packing arrangement of fibres was a square grid, was about 30-40%. This is\nbecause data is collected only from the fibre core area, with the regions between fibres appearing dark. Use\nof a bundle therefore gives a somewhat pixelated appearance to the images. The spatial resolution, however,\nis high, and interpolation or slight smoothing can be used to improve the visual appearance of the OCT\nimages.\n4.2 Detection and processing\nThe detector was a 12-bit digital camera (LaVision) with a 640 by 480 pixel array and a variable integration\ntime. The proximal face of the fibre bundle was imaged, via a beam-splitter, onto the image plane of the\ncamera, typically with a magnification of about 4 to 5. Thus, in the image, a single fibre occupied an area of\n16-25 pixels. OCT data were acquired from the camera by downloading successive frames into image\nbuffers as the mirror in the processing interferometer was scanned over a distance of typically 0.2-2 mm.\nData were processed and displayed either as 2D slices, showing x-z planes (depth slices) or x-y (en-face)\nplanes parallel to the sample surface, as shown in figure 5. Slices stored in either orientation can be stacked\nto produce a full 3D volume image, although the visual interpretation of this is more difficult. The sampling\ninterval was selected to provide data at 300-400 depth positions over a total depth scan range of about\n600\uf06dm, allowing for each fringe envelope encountered to be sampled at least ten times with the source used.\n4.2.1 Sequential subtraction. The OCT signal cannot be isolated from the dc component prior to digitization,\nbecause digitization takes place within the camera. There is no access to the analogue signal for pre-\ndigitization filtering. The presence of the dc background places a limitation on the SNR for direct imaging of\n7the low-contrast fringes typical in OCT. The OCT signal can, however, be isolated following acquisition, by\nappropriate combination of images acquired under different phase conditions.\nIn x-y mode, sample interfaces can be identified by applying a sequential subtraction algorithm to pairs of\nincoming images, and monitoring the difference value obtained for each pixel. When this value reaches a\nmaximum, corresponding to the peak of a fringe envelope, the scan position is recorded in the final output\nbuffer18. A number of samples were investigated, composed of combinations of mirrored and glass surfaces\nin air.\nA\nB\nxy\nz\nFigure 5. Schematic of sample volume showing the coordinate system used and the image orientation for (A)\nen-face and (B) depth slice imaging.\n4.2.2 Modulated acquisition with phase-binning\nIf the sampling interval is much smaller than the OCT fringe period, sequential subtraction is simple to\nimplement, as acquisition need not be synchronised with z-scanning. However, although this method locates\nthe peak of the OCT envelope, it does not accurately measure the amplitude. We therefore investigated a 4-\nstep \u2018phase-binning\u2019 scheme, described by Dubois et al19, implemented by modulating the path length\nsinusoidally, using a piezo-mounted mirror, and pulsing the source synchronously with a duty cycle of 25%.\nThis allows sets of images to be acquired that correspond to intensity integration over each of the four\nquarters of the applied modulation period19.\nThe variation in optical intensity I with time, at any camera pixel, is given by\n))2sin(cos(0 \uf071\uf070\uf079\uf066 \uf02b\uf02b\uf02b\uf03d ftAII (1)\nwhere I0 is the average intensity, A the amplitude of the OCT signal,\uf079 and f the amplitude and frequency\nrespectively of the path-length modulation, and \uf066 and \uf071\uf020 are initial phase values.\nThe pixel intensity values for the four images collected during each quarter of the modulation cycle are\ndenoted Ei, where i=1,2,3,4. Application of the Bessel function expansions \uf047s and\uf020\uf047c for the integrated\nintensity values obtained using (1) enables the dc part of the signal to be rejected, by straightforward\narithmetic combinations s\uf053 and c\uf053 of the four images, as follows:\n\uf066sin4321 AEEEE ss \uf047\uf0b5\uf02d\uf02b\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\uf053 (2a)\n\uf066cos4321 AEEEE cc \uf047\uf0b5\uf02b\uf02d\uf02b\uf02d\uf03d\uf053 (2b)\nFor the particular values \uf079 =2.45 and \uf071\uf020=0.96\uf020, the two Bessel function expansions \uf047s and\uf020\uf047c are equal,\nallowing the interferometer phase to be eliminated and the envelope of the OCT signal to be measured\ndirectly. The resultant image is, in fact, proportional to the square of the OCT envelope amplitude.\n2222 2 Ascs \uf047\uf03d\uf053\uf02b\uf053 (3)\n5. SNR calculations\nWhen assessing a conventional OCT system using high-bandwidth photodetectors, a signal-to-noise analysis\nbased upon the contributions from photon noise, detector noise and excess noise is required. For a full-field\nsystem using a CCD camera, we monitor accumulated charge rather than a continuous photocurrent, and\n8detection is essentially a photon-counting process. The bandwidth filtering and balanced detection techniques\nthat can be applied to improve SNR when using photodetectors are not available in the case of camera\ndetection. A large dc background will dominate the acquired images, with superimposed low-contrast OCT\nfringes.\nThe SNR calculation for camera acquisition takes account of the camera dark noise and readout noise, and\nthe Poisson distributed photon noise on the optical signal. When using the four-step binning algorithm\ndescribed in section 4, the resulting expression for the signal-to-noise is19\nmax\n2\n)1(2\n\uf078\n\uf067\n\uf067 NSNR\n\uf02b\n\uf03d (4)\nWhere N is the number of images acquired for each of the four phase ranges, \uf078max is the full-well capacity of\nthe camera (32,000 electrons for our camera) and \uf067 is the fringe contrast, given by\nincref\nref\nRCRR\nCRR\n2\n2\n\uf02b\uf02b\n\uf03d\uf067 (5)\nHere Rref, R and Rinc are the reference reflectivity, signal reflectivity and proportion of incoherent background\nat the detector respectively. C, in our system, is the recoupling efficiency in the Fizeau cavity. Typically\nmore than 70% of the light is currently lost in re-coupling in the Fizeau section, because NA matching\nbetween the bundle and the focusing optics is rather poor. This could be improved by using custom lenses to\ndesign a probe with appropriate input and output NA values. Although more costly, a telecentric probe\nsystem, offering a very long Rayleigh range, would be the ideal solution. A factor of C \uf0bb 0.3 is included as a\nmultiplier for the sample reflectivity in our current system, to account for recoupling losses.\nIn a Michelson interferometer system the incoherent signal is generally less than 1%, assuming stray\nreflections from fibre ends and bulk components have been suppressed. In the Fizeau system, again assuming\nsuppression of the bundle front-face reflection, the main contribution to the incoherent signal is a large dc\ncomponent resulting from the dual interferometer arrangement. Light which has travelled through both\ninterferometers, but is not path-length matched, makes no contribution to the OCT signal. This fraction is\ngiven by\nCRRR refinc \uf02b\uf03d2 (6)\nThe factor of two arises because incR is defined at the detector, at which position half of the light returning\nfrom reflections in the Fizeau interferometer has been lost. The minimum detectable reflectivity can be\ndefined by a SNR of 2. This leads to\nCN\nR\nR ref\nmax\nmin\n4\n\uf078\n\uf0bb (7)\nFor Rref =0.04 and C=1, this suggests a theoretical minimum detectable reflectivity of about 5 x 10-6, or -53\ndB when N=1. Taking into account fibre recoupling losses, and the fact that most pixels in are not optimally\nilluminated, alters this value to a figure closer to 10-4, or 40 dB.\nThe camera noise contributes significantly to the total noise. We used a 12-bit camera with a full well\ncapacity of 32,000 electrons. The theoretical dark charge noise was typically 20-100 electrons at integration\ntimes used, and the quoted readout noise about 12 electrons. The total measured rms variation on any pixel\ndue to camera noise was about 50 electrons, which will further degrade the SNR from the theoretical value.\nWe would expect, taking this into account, to detect a minimum reflectivity somewhere between 10-4 \u2013 10-3\n(-40 to-30 dB) with the current system, corresponding to a fringe contrast of around 0.06 in the original\ncamera images.\nSNR can be increased by accumulation of multiple images at each depth position. Accumulating images,\nalthough it slows down the acquisition process, should lead to a significant improvement in the theoretical\nSNR. Averaging 10 images for each scan position would be expected to improve the minimum detectable\nreflectivity by about 10 dB (to between -50 and -40 dB), sufficient for some biological applications and\nmany engineering applications. The theoretical SNR also would be increased, for optimally illuminated\n9pixels, by using a cooled camera with a larger full-well capacity and lower noise. Illumination with a near-\nGaussian beam profile will clearly result in optimal performance only close to the centre of the image. A top-\nhat illumination profile would be preferred.\n6. Results\nThe ability of the system to detect surfaces of varying reflectivity was assessed by interposing a 200\uf06dm thick\nmicroscope cover slip across and in contact with a mirror placed in the sample position, so as to cover about\nhalf of the camera image. Figure 6 shows (a) an en-face image, (b) a depth slice image, (c) a representation\nof the sample and (d) a 3D plot generated from the en-face image with slight smoothing applied using a 3x3\nmedian filter. The results presented in figure 6 were obtained using simple sequential subtraction processing.\nThe translation stage was not in this case synchronised with acquisition.\nGlass coverslip\nMirror\nImage region\nFigure 6. (a) Representation of the sample composed of a mirror and a glass coverslip. (b) En-face OCT\nimage of sample. (c) Depth slice OCT image corresponding to the position of the dotted line in (b). (d) 3D\nplot generated from smoothed version of image (a).\nThe interface corresponding to the mirror surface can be clearly identified in both representations. The\nportion of this interface that is in contact with the coverslip appears shifted in the images by about 100\uf06dm.\nThis is because the cover slip increases the optical path length in the Fizeau by a distance t(ng-na), where t is\nthe cover slip thickness and ng=1.5 and na=1 the refractive indices of the glass and of air respectively. The\nsample area addressed is about 1.4 mm x1mm, with a scan depth of about 0.4 mm, and the depth slice\ncorresponds to the central row in the en-face image, as shown.\n40\n0\n\uf06d\nm\n1.4 mm\n1.\n0\nm\nm\n1.4 mm\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\n10\nThe glass\/air interface at the front of the cover slip produces only a 4% reflection, and is therefore more\ndifficult to detect than the mirrored surfaces. However, although much fainter than the signals produced from\nthe mirror reflections, it is visible in the depth slice as a second line near to the top of the image.\nFollowing implementation of the 4-step phase-binning processing scheme, further measurements were made\nto assess the ability of this technique to remove the dc component, and to investigate the effect of\naccumulating multiple images for each of the four phase ranges. Images of a mirror surface, obtained using\naccumulations of 1 and 10 frames at each depth, are shown in figure 7.\nFigure 7. OCT mages obtained from a mirror surface (inverted greyscale) accumulating (a) 1 and (b) 10\nframes for each phase range.\nVariations in illumination efficiency between fibres complicate calculation of the SNR for the images shown\nin figure 7. The SNR for the best-illuminated pixels in the first image is about 40 (16 dB), compared with a\ntheoretical SNR of 28 dB obtained from the analysis in section 5, assuming about half the full-well capacity\nof the CCD camera to be used for the best-illuminated pixels. The theoretical analysis ignores readout noise,\nand it is also possible that the recoupling factor used in the theoretical calculation is over-optimistic. The\nSNR with 10 accumulations increases to about 100 (20 dB). The improvement in contrast is clearly visible in\nthe image using a higher number of accumulated frames. However, the improvement is less than would be\nexpected for the number of accumulations used, which suggests that part of the residual signal results from\ncoherent mixing and is not eliminated by the averaging process.\nIf a display linear with signal value is used, the visual dynamic range is limited to 36 dB, therefore it is\npreferable to use a non-linear scale that compresses the data range. In this case, the square root of the images\nhas been taken before display. The current SNR is insufficient to obtain an image from tissue, due in part to\nthe high incoherent signal contribution inherent to the Fizeau configuration, which places a limit on system\nperformance, and in part to an apparent residual coherent signal, which may result from short (tens of\nmicrons) reflective cavities within the optical system. .\nFigure 8 shows a depth slice OCT image of the surface of a 300 \uf06dm thick plastic film (n \uf0bb1.4 using 50\nacquisitions per phase range at each depth position sampled. An inverted greyscale is used in this case. The\nupper and lower surfaces are plainly visible in the central region of the figure, although the SNR is only just\nsufficient in the region of less well illuminated pixels towards the periphery.\nFigure 8. Inverted greyscale image of both surfaces of a 300 \uf06dm thick plastic film (accumulating 50 frames)\n(b)(a)\n11\nThe value of minimum detectable reflectivity would be improved by increasing the level of illumination to\nfully utilise the full-well capacity of the camera, and by improving NA matching in the probe section to\nensure optimal recoupling to the fibre bundle.\n7. Discussion\nThe bundle-based approach to 3D OCT image acquisition has been successfully demonstrated above for\nlaboratory samples of relatively high reflectivity. The elimination of x-y scanning allows a completely\npassive endoscopic probe to be configured. There are two important questions to be addressed. The first is\nwhether the technique has potential for measurements in biological tissue, where reflectivity values are\nexpected to be two or more orders of magnitude lower than those of the current non-biological laboratory\nsamples. The other issue is acquisition speed; can a bundle-based system run at speeds comparable to current\nsystems incorporating fast x-y galvo-scanners?\n7.1 SNR performance. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the images shown above is adequate for the\nmeasurements made here, but requires significant improvement to allow more complex samples to be\nstudied. One straightforward way to achieve this would be by increasing the power of the source, which\ncurrently provides a maximum of only around 7 mW of optical power. The optical arrangement shown is not\noptimised for efficiency. Half the light is currently lost in the processing interferometer and a further 50%\neach time light passes through the beam splitter at the input of the fibre bundle. The use of a bulk optical\ncirculator, would greatly improve the optical efficiency.\nAn important factor in optimising depth resolution is to minimise cross-talk between the fibres, which\notherwise produces small spurious interferometric intensity oscillations at depth scan positions slightly off\nthe path-balanced condition for a particular sample interface. These arise, as discussed above, when the\nfocused beam-waist at the sample from each fibre becomes larger than the inter-fibre spacing. We are able to\nreduce inter-fibre cross talk to a negligible level, but as our Rayleigh range is less than 100 \uf06dm, this currently\nrequires very careful positioning of the beam focus with respect to our sample. Improvements to the design\nof the focusing optics in the probe head, to increase the Rayleigh range, would relax this requirement\nsignificantly, and improve SNR for depth positions away from the beam focus.\n7.2 Acquisition speed. The processing time currently required in our system to generate an image in either\nthe x-y or x-z plane is of the order of several minutes. However, this is limited primarily by a slow\nprocessing algorithm. The camera is capable of reading out data at 30 frames per second; faster if pixel\nbinning is employed to reduce the amount of data per frame. Thus a set of say 100 images acquired at a\nsampling interval of 2 \uf06dm could be obtained within 3s or less and stored straight to RAM. Some further time\nwould need to be allocated for post-processing, but 3D OCT information would be obtained in seconds rather\nthan minutes. Current fast systems using galvanometer scanners produce an image in around 1-5 s, so the\npotential acquisition speed of the camera system approaches that of mechanically scanned instruments.\n8. Conclusions\nAn imaging fibre bundle has been employed to construct a full-field OCT system with a passive endoscopic\nprobe section. It has been shown that 3D structural information can be obtained from a sample without any\nrequirement for beam-scanning in the x-y plane normal to the optical axis. The spatial resolution of the\nbundle-based system compares well with that of active OCT designs using galvanometer mirrors. For the\ncurrent system, the spatial resolution in the x-y plane and the depth resolution are both about 30\uf06dm.\nMeasurements have been successfully made on non-biological surfaces in air, over scan depths of up to\nabout 0.75 mm. The SNR of the system is adequate to detect glass\/air interfaces, but is currently insufficient\nto allow biological samples to be imaged. However, modifications to improve the SNR to the required value\nhave been discussed, including an increase in source power and inclusion of additional optical components to\nproduce a more efficient configuration. Further investigation, following implementation of these\nimprovements, will determine the ultimate quality of the 3D images acquired when bundle-based OCT is\nused to examine biological tissue.\n12\nAcknowledgments\nHelen Ford acknowledges a Daphne Jackson Research Fellowship sponsored by the Royal Academy of\nEngineering.\nReferences\n[1] Colston B W, Everett M J, DaSilva L B, Otis L L, Stroeve P and Nathel H 1998 Imaging of hard- and\nsoft-tissue structure in the oral cavity by optical coherence tomography Appl.
