Introduction\n[2] It is well known that powerful high-frequency (HF)\nradio waves, transmitted from the ground, can efficiently\nincrease the electron temperature Te in the ionospheric D and\nE regions [e.g., Meltz et al., 1974]. Temperature changes\noccur with a very short time constant, typically 1 ms (at\n90 km altitude) after the heater is switched on [Stubbe et al.,\n1982]. With a longer time constant of several seconds (at\n90 km altitude) the electron density is increased owing to\nthe impact of HF heating on recombination rates [Stubbe et\nal., 1982]. The variations in the local electron temperature\nand density subsequently change the local Pedersen and\nHall conductivity, sP and sH.\n[3] If the HF power is applied with a modulation fre-\nquency f, the conductivities will also be modulated with a\nfrequency f. In the presence of a natural ionospheric d.c.\ncurrent, an a.c. component will thus be superimposed. A\ncomprehensive theoretical framework of modulated heating\nbased on earlier work by Stubbe and Kopka [1977] is given\nby Borisov and Stubbe [1997].\n[4] If f is in the ELF\/VLF range, the change in the\nelectron density is small owing to the higher time constant\nwhereas a significant effect on the local electron tempera-\nture is achieved. In this case, only the comparatively small\nPedersen conductivity sP is modulated and the modulated\ncurrent will act as a giant antenna, radiating ELF\/VLF\nwaves with frequency f.\n[5] If f is small enough to allow for changes in the local\nelectron density (ULF range) both sP and sH are affected.\nAgain, if a natural d.c. current is present, an a.c. component\nwill be superimposed. Although in this case the effective\nradiated power (ERP) of the virtual antenna is small, the\namplitude of the local magnetic disturbance is large.\n[6] Using the above described mechanism a number of\nheating experiments at ELF\/VLF [e.g., Stubbe et al., 1982]\nand ULF [e.g., Stubbe and Kopka, 1981; Kornienko et al.,\n2003] frequencies have been conducted since the 1970s. An\noverview of heating experiments done with the heater\nfacility located near Troms\u00f8, Norway, at various modulation\nfrequencies is given by Stubbe [1996].\n[7] Theoretical considerations show that the modulated\ncurrent will launch fast and Alfve\u00b4n waves into the magne-\ntosphere [Fejer and Krenzien, 1982; Borisov and Stubbe,\n1997]. The Alfve\u00b4n mode is, regarding the small dimensions\nof the source and the wave\u2019s propagation along the mag-\nnetic field lines, far more important then the fast mode.\nRobinson et al. [2000] provided strong evidence that\nartificially generated Alfve\u00b4n waves at 3 Hz were registered\nby satellite borne magnetic instruments above the heating\nfacility at Troms\u00f8, Norway.\n[8] All experiments of ULF wave generation by modu-\nlated heating so far have been conducted on closed field\nlines. At these latitudes the highest pulsation amplitudes and\nthus the best results are expected when the modulation\nfrequency is close to the local natural frequency of the field\nline as the driving would be near resonant.\n[9] It is therefore imperative to know the natural frequency\nof the concerned field line for such an experiment to work.\nThis is not a trivial task, as the fundamental frequency\nchanges owing to time of day, solar activity and other\nparameters such as mass loading along the field line.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A01305, doi:10.1029\/2007JA012617, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester,\nLeicester, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2007JA012617$09.00\nA01305 1 of 9\n[10] On open field lines however, when one end of the\nfield line is essentially unbound, the above mentioned\nconstraint is no longer valid when trying to stimulate waves.\nModulated heating at virtually any frequency will produce\nwave activity on that open field line given the right iono-\nspheric conditions.\n[11] When trying to induce ULF wave activity using\nmodulated heating, the principal and unavoidable problem\nof presenting proof for having successfully altered the\nionospheric conditions by analyzing ground-based magnetic\nfield data is always that the oscillations observed could have\nhad a natural origin. Careful analysis of prevailing solar\nwind conditions and ground-based magnetic measurements\nin the vicinity of the heating facility is imperative to\neliminate this problem as much as possible.\n[12] The new Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar\n(SPEAR) has been operational since late 2004. It was\ndesigned and built at the Radio and Plasma Physics Group\nof Leicester University and is described by Wright et al.\n[2000] and Robinson et al. [2006]. It was erected near\nLongyearbyen, Svalbard (78\u000190N 16\u000140E), and can be oper-\nated in four very different modes: (1) generation of field\naligned irregularities, (2) field guided ELF wave injection,\n(3) stimulation of ULF waves, and (4) \u2018\u2018All-Sky\u2019\u2019 radar\ncapabilities. So far, results using the first and second mode\nhave been published [Robinson et al., 2006; Scoffield et al.,\n2006] while operation in the fourth mode is ongoing. Here\nwe present first results of operations in the third mode.\n[13] The SPEAR system is currently the only ionospheric\nheating facility which is routinely located inside the north-\nern polar cap and thus frequently operates on open field\nlines. In this paper we present strong evidence that the\nSPEAR system created a local magnetic ULF pulsation with\na frequency of 1.67 mHz (10 min period) on open field\nlines.\n2. Observations and Discussion\n[14] Between 2230 and 2330 UT on 23 February 2007 the\nSPEAR system was operated at 4.45 MHz with a 1 Hz\nmodulation in X mode polarization with a five minute on,\nfive minute off cycle. The X mode polarization was used to\ngenerate local enhancements in the electron temperature Te\nin the lower ionosphere above the facility.\n[15] The higher-frequency modulation at 1 Hz was\nemployed simultaneously in order to stimulate the iono-\nspheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator (IAR), results of which will not be\ndiscussed here. Theory of this resonant interaction and some\nresults are given by Scoffield et al. [2006]. Instead, the\nresults of the 1.67 mHz modulation will be reported. The\nperiod of the lower frequency on\/off cycle was long enough\nto allow for changes in the recombination rate to occur and\nthus an affect on the local electron density was expected.\n[16] Figure 1 gives an overview of the positions of\nground-based magnetometers and SPEAR in a magnetic\nlatitude against Magnetic Local Time (MLT) coordinate\nsystem at 2300 UT. Also plotted is the position of the\nauroral oval according to the model by Holzworth and\nMeng [1975]. The model input parameter is Kp = 1 which\nis the value extracted from The International Service of\nGeomagnetic Indices (ISGI) at http:\/\/isgi.cetp.ipsl.fr\/.\n[17] The poleward boundary of the oval can be used as a\nproxy for the Open\/Closed Field Line Boundary (OCFLB).\nHence Figure 1 shows that SPEAR and all magnetometers\nlocated on the Svalbard archipelago were located on open\nfield lines. The position of the OCFLB was confirmed by\nDoppler shift data of the CUTLASS radars and ion\/electron\nspectra gathered by the DMSP 13, 15 and 16 satellites (all\nnot shown).\n2.1. Ionospheric Conditions\n[18] To monitor ionospheric conditions, an ionosonde is\nsituated next to SPEAR which records an ionogram every\nfour minutes. Figure 2 shows the recorded ionograms just\nbefore and during the time of the experiment. Since SPEAR\noperation saturates the ionosonde receiver, only ionograms\nwhenever SPEAR was off are shown.\n[19] Until around 2310 UT reflected power from the\nSvalbard ionosonde was weak, with average signal-to-noise\nratios below 4 dB. This indicates significant absorption of\nthe ionosonde signal in the lower ionosphere, as required for\nelectrojet modification experiments. The value of foF2 was\nbelow the SPEAR pump frequency as indicated by the\nvertical dashed line, thus the signal at least partially pene-\ntrated the ionosphere.\n[20] As the experiment proceeded ionograms indicate an\nincrease of the foF2 and an increase in overall reflected\npower. At 2326 UT the average reflected power lay at 8 dB,\nsuggesting lower absorption rates than earlier during the\nexperiment.\n[21] However with an increasing foF2, ionospheric re-\nflection of the SPEAR pump wave became stronger, allow-\ning for a stronger interaction between the SPEAR pump\nwave and the absorbing lower ionosphere, as multiple\ntraversals of the region were then possible.\nFigure 1. Positions of magnetometer stations in the\nnorthern polar cap on 23 February 2007, 2300 UT. The\nauroral oval is indicated for Kp = 1.\nA01305 CLAUSEN ET AL.: ULF WAVE INJECTED BY SPEAR\n2 of 9\nA01305\n2.2. Ground-Based Observations\n[22] Figure 3 provides strong evidence that the heating\nexperiment modified the ionospheric conductivities and\nsubsequently induced magnetic variations.\n[23] In all plots in the left columns of Figure 3, times\nduring which the background is shaded gray are those when\nthe heater was on, a white background indicates the heater\nwas off.\n[24] The top left plot of Figure 3 shows the SPEAR\nreflected power at 4.45 MHz measured by the Doppler\nsounder located some 50 km away from the SPEAR system\nin Barentsburg. It clearly shows the times during which\nSPEAR was on as a sharp increase in measured signal-to-\nnoise ratio. The reflected power decreased during the first\nthree on-off cycles and increased during the last three cycles\nof the modulation experiment, in accordance with the\nenhancement of the ionospheric F layer and the increase\nin foF2 as discussed above.\n[25] Examination of the Doppler shift of the SPEAR\nreflected wave (not shown) shows that the received signal\nwas significantly Doppler shifted from the transmit frequency\nafter the third SPEAR on cycle (2250 UT). Hence the\nincrease in the reflected power shown in Figure 3 after\n2250 UT was due to the ionospherically reflected signal\nwhereas the background signal around 30 dB was due to the\nground wave.\n[26] The top right plot of Figure 3 shows the Fourier\ncoefficients of the time series on the left. It shows, not\nsurprisingly, a strong peak at the modulation frequency of\n1.67 mHz.\n[27] The other plots in the left column in Figure 3 show\ndata from several ground-based magnetometer stations also\nlocated within the northern polar cap (see Figure 1). The\nmagnitude of the horizontal magnetic field H is shown,\ncalculated via\nH2 \u00bc X 2GEO \u00fe Y 2GEO;\nwhere XGEO and YGEO represent the local geographic north-\nsouth and east-west component of the magnetic field,\nrespectively. The sampling period was 10 s for NAL and\nLYR, 60 s for HRN, CBB, RES, THL, GDH, 20 s for SCO\nand 1 s for TALO.\n[28] A linear trend has been subtracted from the data,\nno further filtering was applied to the time series displayed\nin Figure 3. In the right column the absolute Fourier\ncoefficients are plotted. All time series have been interpo-\nlated such that the sampling period was 60 s prior to\nFigure 2. Ionograms measured by the ionosonde next to SPEAR. The right vertical dashed line at\n4.45 MHz indicates the SPEAR pump frequency, and the left line indicates the lowest sampling\nfrequency of the ionosonde. The time of measurement in UT is given in the top left corner of each plot.\nA01305 CLAUSEN ET AL.: ULF WAVE INJECTED BY SPEAR\n3 of 9\nA01305\napplying the FFT. The power values were then divided by\nthe peak power of the HRN spectrum at 1.67 mHz.\n[29] Between 2244 and 2330 a clear signal with the same\nfrequency as the modulation was observed in data from\nstations located in the close vicinity of SPEAR (NAL, LYR\nand HRN). The main contribution to this signal is made by\nmeasurements in the XGEO component. This observation is\nFigure 3. (top) SPEAR reflected power measured by a Doppler sounder located in Barentsburg and its\nFourier spectrum. The other plots show ground-based magnetometer data and FFTs of stations located in\nthe northern polar cap.\nA01305 CLAUSEN ET AL.: ULF WAVE INJECTED BY SPEAR\n4 of 9\nA01305\nsupported by a strong peak at 1.67 mHz in the Fourier\nspectra of these stations.\n[30] There are, however, similar peaks in the Fourier\nspectra data from other stations, most notably CBB, TALO,\nGDH and SCO. However the respective time series showed\nno obvious sign of a wave form similar to that observed by\nthe three magnetometers located on Svalbard. Only the FFT\npower at 1.67 mHz of SCO reaches higher values than\nNAL, LYR and HRN, indicating some background wave\nactivity during the time of the event at this station.\n[31] Dynamic Fourier power spectra in the frequency\nrange 1.0 < f < 3.0 mHz are shown in Figure 4. Each\nspectrum was calculated from a moving time series of\nlength 4000 s. The vertical white lines indicate the start\nand end time of the modulation experiment, the horizontal\nwhite line indicates the modulation frequency. All data have\nbeen handled as described in the discussion of Figure 3.\n[32] In data from the three magnetometers located near\nthe SPEAR system there was a clear peak in the dynamic\npower coincident with the time of the heating experiment.\nThis shows that wave activity in the according frequency\nrange was enhanced only during the time of heating.\n[33] Dynamic spectra from all other stations show no\npeak during the time of the experiment. The spectral power\nat 1.67 mHz for these stations is overall low, only in data\nfrom SCO there is enhanced power during the experiment\nwhen compared to the HRN spectra. However, between\n2230 and 2330 UT the spectral power was lower then before\nand after.\n[34] When taking into account the data from all stations\nwe conclude that the natural wave activity at the modulation\nfrequency in the polar cap during the heating experiment\nwas low. This strengthens the interpretation of the observed\nwave activity at the Svalbard stations as artificially induced\nby SPEAR.\n[35] To investigate the phase relationship between the\nheating cycle and oscillations seen in ground-based mag-\nnetometer data the cross phase technique was used. Each\ndatum in Figure 5 represents the cross phase between a\nmoving 1000 s interval of the ground magnetometer data\nFigure 4. Dynamic spectra of ground-based magnetometer data (compare Figure 1).\nA01305 CLAUSEN ET AL.: ULF WAVE INJECTED BY SPEAR\n5 of 9\nA01305\n(as shown in Figure 3) and a moving 1000 s interval of a\n10 min period sine wave.

The\nlegend indicates which line styles represent which station.\nThe vertical dashed lines enclose the time of the modulation\nexperiment.\n[36] Convection maps of the northern hemisphere indi-\ncate westward flow, i.e., westward current over Svalbard\nduring the time of the experiment (not shown). Modulating\nboth conductivities then causes a modulation in the local\nnorth-south magnetic field, as is indeed observed. During\ntimes of heating the electron density increases on timescales\nof several seconds, as mentioned in the introduction. Sub-\nsequently the conductivities and the westward current\nincrease and accordingly the southward field increases.\nThe oscillations in electron density, conductivities, current\nand magnetic field are all expected to be in phase. Hence\nany phase shift detected by the cross phase technique\nbetween the observed magnetic field and the heating cycle\nhighlights the timescales on which heating affects the\nelectron densities.\n[37] If there were no delay in the dependence of the\nmagnetic field from the heating cycle, the southward\nmagnetic field would increase as soon as the heater in\nswitch on. This corresponds to a decrease in the XGEO\ncomponent since in the local geographic coordinate system\nNorth is positive. Hence, for the cross phase calculation, the\nsine wave representing the heating cycle has negative values\nduring periods of \u2018\u2018heater on\u2019\u2019.\n[38] Since a moving time series of the ground data was\nemployed, only cross phases in the interval [Start Time +\nMoving Interval Length\/2, End Time - Moving Interval\nLength\/2] are calculated from data recorded entirely during\nthe modulation experiment. The borders of this interval\nhave been marked with vertical solid lines in Figure 5.\nHence cross phases outside this interval have to be treated\ncarefully since their calculation includes measurements of\ntime before and after the heating experiments.\n[39] Figure 5 shows that the phase relationship between\ndata from the three magnetometers located on Svalbard and\nthe sinusoidal driver remained fairly constant during the\nentire modulation experiment. There was no such constant\nphase relationship before and after the experiment. Owing\nto the way the cross phase was calculated, a positive value\ncorresponds to the driver leading in phase.\n[40] The calculated cross phase of 160\u0001 translates to a lag\nof the magnetometer signal by several minutes. This seems\nreasonable when considering the time constants of iono-\nspheric density changes due to the heating\u2019s impact on\nrecombination rates. However, no experimental or modeled\ndata is available which would allow us to compare our\nresult.\n[41] Additionally, there was no constant phase relation-\nship between the assumed driver and data from any other\nstation located inside the northern polar cap, as Figure 5\nclearly shows. This provides strong evidence that the\nheating experiment modified the ionospheric conductivities\nand subsequently generated a local ULF pulsation on open\nfield lines.\n2.3. Solar Wind Conditions\n[42] As briefly mentioned in the introduction, the princi-\npal problem of showing that magnetic variations are due to\nheating experiments is the occurrence of abundant natural\noscillations in similar frequency ranges. Since SPEAR was\ninside the polar cap during the time of the event (see Figure\n1), the adjacent terrestrial magnetic field was connected to\nand thus coupled with the Interplanetary Magnetic Field\n(IMF). Hence solar wind conditions were studied in order to\nexclude as far as possible the chance of the observed\noscillations being of natural origin.\n[43] The IMF was measured by the MAG instrument\nonboard the ACE satellite which was located at the L1\npoint. The distance between the L1 point and Earth was\n\u0004150 \u0005 106 km and hence the lag between the time of\nmeasurement at the L1 point and the time of the arrival of\nthe solar wind and the frozen-in magnetic flux at Earth\nneeds to be considered.\n[44] The solar wind conditions were quiet during the time\nof the event. The solar wind speed in the X GSM direction\nwas around 280 km\/s. During the event the four Cluster\nFigure 5. Cross phase between a sine with a 10-min period and data from several ground-based\nmagnetometers.\nA01305 CLAUSEN ET AL.: ULF WAVE INJECTED BY SPEAR\n6 of 9\nA01305\nsatellites were located above the southern polar cap on open\nfield lines: (xGSM, yGSM, zGSM) \u0004 (0, 0, \u00065) Re. On the basis\nof a comparison of similar distinct features, the lag time\nbetween measurements at the ACE and the Cluster position\ncan be determined to be around 100 minutes.\n[45] Figure 6 shows the X, Y and Z GSM component of\nthe IMF (left column). The time window has been chosen so\nthat it accounts for the lag time of the solar wind. In the raw\ndata, vertical dashed lines have been plotted every ten\nminutes as a guide for the eye. The raw data show some\nindication of wave activity at the modulation frequency, but\nno obvious sign of a pulsation with a ten minute period was\nobserved.\n[46] The right column in Figure 6 shows the Fourier\nspectrum of the time series on the left. The bold vertical\nline marks the modulation frequency at 1.67 mHz. The lines\nto the right and left mark the frequency window for which\nthe dynamic spectrum in Figure 7 was calculated, as\ndiscussed later. The Fourier spectra of all IMF components\nshow a broad peak around the modulation frequency. Hence\nsome power at the modulation frequency might have been\nexpected in the ground-based magnetometer sites inside the\npolar cap around the time of the modulation due to the wave\nactivity in the IMF. The reader is reminded, however, that\nthe raw time series did not show any obvious sign of wave\nactivity in the frequency window concerned.\n[47] Figure 7 shows the temporal development of the\nFourier power in three frequency ranges for the X, Y and Z\nGSM component. The power was calculated from a moving\ntime series with a length of 5000 s which leads to a\nfrequency resolution of 0.20 mHz. The legend in the top\nright corner lists the frequency ranges. The vertical dashed\nlines mark the beginning and end of the modulation, lagged\nby the propagation time of the solar wind plasma. The\npower for all three components in the 1.50 to 1.70 mHz\nrange (solid line) and the adjacent higher-frequency band\n(dashed line) significantly increased during the event. The\nbiggest increase was observed in the X GSM component.\nThe same is not true for the adjacent lower frequency band.\n[48] The occurrence of wave activity in the frequency\nrange around the modulation frequency in the IMF could\nhave led to a small enhancement of power in all magne-\ntometer stations in the northern polar cap (compare with the\nFourier spectra in Figure 3). However, only the data of the\nSvalbard stations show a large peak due to the activity\ninduced by the modulated heating.\n3. Conclusions\n[49] We present strong evidence that a ULF wave\nregistered by three magnetometers on the Svalbard archi-\npelago was stimulated by modulated heating of the iono-\nsphere by the SPEAR system. During the heating\nexperiment a clear signature of a ULF wave with the same\nfrequency as the modulation was observed in data from\nmagnetometers around SPEAR. The occurrence of this\nFigure 6.

To the best of our knowledge, the\nevidence presented in this paper is the first to confirm\nsuccessful generation of ULF waves on open field lines.\n[51] Acknowledgments.
