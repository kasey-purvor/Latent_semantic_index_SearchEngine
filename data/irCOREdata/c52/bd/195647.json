INTRODUCTION\nThe statistical characteristic of insulation breakdown re-\nflects the failure rate and reliability of insulation, and is im-\nportant for manufacture and asset management. It is well\nknown that breakdown strength in polymers shows a much\nlarger dispersion than in liquids and gases,1 and the large\ndispersion is usually considered due to the weak points. As\nsome external weak points \u0001e.g., the metal protrusions on\nelectrode and contamination particles, etc.\u0002 exist in all the\ninsulation systems of gases, liquids, and solids, the large dis-\npersion of breakdown in polymers cannot be attributed to\nthese external weak points. Therefore, the internal structure\n\u0001or the morphology\u0002 of polymers may play an important role\nin determining the stochastic behavior of breakdown.\nThe Weibull distribution,2 which is based on the model\nof \u201cweakest links,\u201d has been extensively used as an empirical\nlaw. This distribution is one of the extreme value\ndistributions3 without definite physical implications on a re-\nlationship between the breakdown statistics and the internal\nstructure of insulating polymers. Only a few theoretical\napproaches3,4 have been carried out to assess its validity in\npolymer breakdown, especially in the practically important\nregion of low failure probability. It has also been shown that\nmany breakdown processes governed by an initiation stage,\ncommonly observed in ramp-to-breakdown experiments,\nhave breakdown strength statistics described by the Gumbel\ndistribution, which is a different extreme value statistic. The\ntwo statistics differ in the form of the property distribution\nfrom which the extreme value is chosen, with the Weibull\nform being applicable to breakdown generating features that\napproach their extreme as a decaying power law, while the\nGumbel form occurs when the extreme is approached as a\ndecaying exponential. In addition to these theoretical ques-\ntions as to the applicability of the Weibull distribution to\npolymer breakdown, there are some experimental doubts as\nwell, for example, it has been shown that the low field break-\ndowns measured with the large electrode deviated from the\nWeibull distribution.5,6 Furthermore the area effect of break-\ndown also showed deviation from the Weibull distribution\n\u0001see also Ref. 3 for theoretical considerations of the same\neffect\u0002. In the two-parameter Weibull distribution, the scale\nparameter \u0001 and the shape parameter \u0002 are fitted to experi-\nmental data as the following equation:\nP\u0001E\u0002 = 1 \u2212 exp\u0005\u2212 \u0006E\n\u0001\n\u0007\u0002\b , \u00011\u0002\nwhere P\u0001E\u0002 is the cumulative probability of failure for fields\nup to E.\nIf the sample area is enlarged to n-times, the failure\nprobability can be written as\nPn\u0001E\u0002 = 1 \u2212 \u00031 \u2212 P\u0001E\u0002\u0004n = 1 \u2212 exp\u0005\u2212 n\u0006E\n\u0001\n\u0007\u0002\b . \u00012\u0002\nEquation \u00012\u0002 indicates that if breakdown follows the Weibull\ndistribution, the shape parameter \u0002 should not change with\nthe increase in electrode area and the value of 1 \/\u0001\u0002 should\nbe proportional to the electrode area. However, these contra-\ndict with the experimental data of area dependence of\nbreakdown.5,6 The question of the applicability of the\nWeibull distribution to polymer breakdown is therefore still\nnot resolved and models for the stochastic mechanism of\nbreakdown are needed in order to study this question in more\ndetail.\nRecently, a percolation model for breakdown and aging\nhas been set forward.7\u20139 This model describes the polymer as\ncontaining a three-dimensional cubic lattice of electron trap\nsites with a range of barriers for electron transfer between the\nsites. In the presence of an electric field the barrier heights\nare reduced and the sites with the barrier reduced to zero can\nbe connected as clusters. When the electric field is high\nenough, a percolation cluster extending across the materiala\u0002Electronic mail: wukai@mail.xjtu.edu.cn.\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 107, 064107 \u00012010\u0002\n0021-8979\/2010\/107\u00026\u0001\/064107\/5\/$30.00 \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics107, 064107-1\nAuthor complimentary copy.

The Monte Carlo calcula-\ntion has proven that a critical percolation threshold exists\nabove which the percolation path appears. This is expressed\nthrough a parameter \u0003\u0001E\u0002, which defines the largest barrier\nthat can be reduced to zero by an electric field of value E.\nFor traps in which the trapped electron moves on a hydro-\ngenic potential surface \u0001Poole\u2013Frenkel traps10\u0002, \u0003\u0001E\u0002 can be\nwritten as\n\u0003\u0001E\u0002 = \u0001e3\/\u0004\u0005\u00021\/2E1\/2, \u00013\u0002\nwhere \u0005 is the permittivity. In this paper, we set forward an\napproach to study the stochastic behavior of breakdown on\nthe basis of this model.\nII. SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS\nA. Effects of sample size and defect distribution\nThe field-assisted percolation model provides an ap-\nproach to connect the stochastic behavior with the disorder in\npolymer structure. As polyethylene is a matrix containing a\ndisordered disposition of the amorphous and crystalline\nphases and free volume \u0001unoccupied lattice sites or nano-\nholes\u0002 it can be represented by a matrix of randomly distrib-\nuted traps with the trap barriers in a certain range in the\npercolation model.8 However, because the percolation\nthreshold is a constant and shows no dispersion in an infinite\nmatrix, it is necessary to investigate the stochastic character-\nistics of breakdown in a matrix with limited size.\nFigure 1 shows the simulated results in the cases of dif-\nferent network sizes. In Fig. 1, each curve is fitted to the data\nof 50 simulation samples. In each sample, the trap barrier at\nthe sites of cubic network is assumed to be uniformly dis-\ntributed in the range from 0 to 1 eV, and then the percolation\nthreshold of the sample \u0001i.e., the minimum field at which a\npercolation path connecting the upper and lower sides the\nnetwork appears\u0002 can be calculated \u0001refer to Ref. 7\u0002. Figure 1\nshows that the simulated breakdown strength can be approxi-\nmately fitted to a Weibull-distribution law. With the reduc-\ntion in network size, the \u0001-value \u0001i.e., the voltage at which\nthe accumulative probability of breakdown is 63%\u0002 and the\n\u0002-value decrease. When the network size is reduced from\n100\u0006100\u0006100 to 30\u000630\u000630, the \u0002-value becomes 6.55\nfrom 17.9. For a trap of the Poole-Frenkel type, it has been\nshown that the interaction between trap barrier potentials is\nconsiderably reduced when the trap density is less than\n1024\u20131025 m\u22123,8 and thus the Coulombic force may affect a\nregion with a radius of only about 10\u201320 nm. However as the\nactual largest size of amorphous and crystalline phases and\nnanoholes may be over 100 nm, the effective length of unit\nsegment of the simulation matrix representative of the poly-\nmer may be significantly increased above that of the trap\nradius. Therefore the simulation results in Fig. 1 is very close\nto the experimental results that the \u0002-value increased from\nless than 10 to over 20 when the sample thickness is in-\ncreased from 4 to 14 \u0007m.6 Here, in the following calcula-\ntion, we chose the network thickness to be 30 for simplicity.\nFigure 2 shows the simulated results in the cases of dif-\nferent sample areas when the trap barrier is assumed to be\nuniformly distributed in the range from 0 to 1 eV. Because of\nthe edge effect of the sample, the \u0002-value of small samples\n\u000130\u000630\u000630\u0002 differs from those of the larger samples.\nWhen the sample area is larger than 200\u0006200, the \u0002-value\nseems not change with sample area, and the value of 1 \/\u0001\u0002\nincreases with the area \u0001as Table I\u0002. These suggest that the\nWeibull distribution is a suitable statistical approximation.\nHowever, if a small concentration of large defects is intro-\nduced into the sample, the simulation results deviate from\nthe Weibull distribution \u0001as in Fig. 3\u0002. In Fig. 3, large defects\nare treated as traps with zero barrier8 \u0001i.e., they are regions\nthrough which an electron can pass without hindrance, such\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Weibull-distribution plot of breakdown in the\nsamples with different sizes \u0001each curve contains 50 simulated data\u0002.

The defect\nsize and the density of defect number are assumed to be 12\n\u000612\u000612 \u0001corresponding to a one micron diameter void\nwhen the unit segment in simulation network is 100 nm\u0002 and\n0.4 \/1003, respectively. Because of the small concentration of\nlarge defects, few of them exist in the small samples with\nlimited number, and thus the simulated results of small\nsamples still approximately follow the Weibull distribution.\nHowever, in the large samples, the results of low breakdown\nstrength deviate from the Weibull distribution. These agrees\nwith the experimental results of other authors.5,6 In practice,\nthese large defects may be formed on the material surface or\nbulk due to thermal instability, mechanical vibration, or in-\nternal stress in the manufacture process.\nThe effect of large defects can also explain the phenom-\nena that the \u0002-value tends to be smaller in actual thick\nsamples although it increases with sample thickness in the\ncase of thin films.6 In fact, although the usual sample for\nbreakdown test is about 1 mm, the effective thickness to\ndominate breakdown may be much thinner than the sample\nthickness. Under dc voltage, because of the effect of space\ncharge, the thickness of the layer with maximum field may\nbe just about 1 \u0007m. Under ac or impulse voltage, after the\ninitial electron avalanche driven by the higher field develops\nin a certain distance, a high density of space charge can be\nformed, leading to the local field in front of the breakdown\npath high enough to make the breakdown self-sustainable.\nThus, here, we suppose that the effective thickness to domi-\nnate initial breakdown may not be larger than decades of\nmicrons in thick samples, and the larger dispersion of break-\ndown \u0001i.e., a smaller \u0002-value\u0002 in usual thick samples can be\nexplained in terms of the existence of large defects.\nIt should be pointed out that the actual breakdown\nstrength is higher than the critical percolation threshold be-\ncause a final breakdown occurs when the electron multipli-\ncation is developed to a certain value. The effects of electron\nmultiplication or the thermal conduction of films lead to the\nthickness dependence of breakdown \u0001i.e., the increase in\nbreakdown strength with thickness reduction\u0002.10 This is dif-\nferent from the simulation results in Fig. 1 showing that the\ncritical percolation threshold decreases with thickness reduc-\ntion. Here, although the critical percolation threshold is dif-\nferent from the actual breakdown strength, we assume that its\ndispersion can reflect the stochastic property of actual break-\ndown. In actual thick samples when the sample thickness is\nlarger than the effective thickness to dominate initial break-\ndown, the critical percolation threshold should be quite close\nthe actual breakdown strength.\nB. Stochastic property of life time\nBy using the previous model for electrical aging,9 which\ndescribed the development of deteriorated regions, the sto-\nchastic property of lifetime can be also investigated. Here, as\nin the previous model,9 we assume that 2% of the sites origi-\nnally exist with zero barriers, and the deteriorated sites are\nalso assumed to be of zero barrier. The local deterioration,\ni.e., the rate of one site changing to deteriorated sites due to\nthe aging effect, is expressed as\nri = \t\nj\nf\u0001Eij,lj\u0002 , \u00014\u0002\nwhere the summation \t j is taken for all the neighbor sites of\nsite i. f\u0001Eij , lj\u0002 is a function standing for the contribution to\nthe deterioration from the direction of the neighbor site j. Eij\nis the electrical field between the sites i and j. Here, f\u0001Eij , lj\u0002\nis not only related to field but also to the size of existing\ndeteriorated region. This agrees with the simulation of aging\nby Dissado and Thabet,4 in which the extension of deterio-\nration depended on the surrounding damage and deteriora-\ntion size,\nf\u0001Eij,lj\u0002 \b \n\u0001Eij\u0002\u00010\u0001lj\u0002\u00020, \u0001lj \t 1\u0002\u0001Eij\u0002\u00010, \u0001lj = 0\u0002 ,\u000b \u00015\u0002\nwhere lj is the maximum distance along the field from the\nedge of deteriorated region to a site j inside the region, and E\nis the field in the deteriorated region. \u00010 and \u00020 are con-\nstants. \u00020 influences the accumulation pattern of deteriorated\nregion, percolationlike breakdown corresponds to \u00020\n2, in\nwhich the percolation threshold is reduced due to the gradual\nglobal increase in deteriorated sites, and avalanchelike break-\ndown corresponds to \u00020\u000b2, in which breakdown occurs by\nthe rapid growth of a filamentary structure. This latter behav-\nior corresponds to that found in Ref. 4 where the deteriorated\nregion was assumed to be conducting and hence giving an\nenhancement of the local electric field.\nHere, in this paper, we define the lifetime as the time\nwhen the breakdown strength of a sample decreases to 1\/10\nof the original average breakdown strength, and the lifetime\nof different samples are simulated \u0001Fig. 4\u0002. Because \u00010 does\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Weibull-distribution plot of breakdown in the\nsamples with different areas and large defects \u0001each curve contains 50 simu-\nlated data\u0002.\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Weibull-distribution plot of lifetime \u0001the sample size\nis 100\u0006100\u000630, each curve contains 20 simulated data\u0002.\n064107-3 Wu et al.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright, see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nnot influence the accumulation pattern of deteriorated\nregion,9 we choose \u00010=2 in our simulation. In order to save\ncomputation time, we choose the sample size to be 100\n\u0006100\u000630, and 20 sample data are simulated in each case.\nFigure 4 shows that the lifetime can be still fitted to the\nWeibull distribution. Moreover, the slope of the fitted lines in\nFig. 4 \u0001i.e., the \u0002-value\u0002 decreases with the increase in \u00020,\nindicating the increase in lifetime dispersion with the in-\ncrease in \u00020. Because the stochastic property of lifetime is\nnot only related to the disorder in morphology, but also re-\nlated to the stochastic development of the deteriorated re-\ngion, the avalanchelike breakdown leads to a larger disper-\nsion of lifetime than percolationlike breakdown. The latter\nform of breakdown relates to a global state of deterioration\nand would tend to have a development that approaches to-\nward deterministic behavior, which would have \u0002=\f. As\nactual \u0002-values in aging life experiments are usually 0.5\u20132, it\nis suggested that avalanchelike breakdown tends to occur in\npolymers, in which the deterioration rate is closely related to\nthe size of deteriorated region, as found in Ref. 4.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nConsidering that the trap sites with barrier below \u0003\u0001E\u0002\nmay connect to form the percolation clusters at field E, the\naccumulative breakdown probability at field E can be ex-\npressed as the probability of finding one cluster\u2019s length\nlarger than a certain value l \u0001i.e., the sample thickness in our\nsimulation\u0002. Although a similar assumption that breakdown\noccurs when the maximum cluster\u2019s length becomes large\nenough was proposed by other authors,10\u201312 here, a quantita-\ntive approach to describe the stochastic behavior of electrical\nbreakdown strength and lifetime can be derived from our\nmodel. In a matrix with finite size, the probability of no\nclusters larger than l can be written as13,14\nC\u0001l\u0002 = exp\u0003\u2212 cLd exp\u0001\u2212 kl\u0002\u0004 , \u00016\u0002\nwhere c and k are constants, d is the dimension, L is the\nsample size, and Ld represents the sample volume.\nEquation \u00016\u0002 is the appropriate distribution function far\nfrom the percolation threshold,14 and thus is suitable to de-\nscribe the low field breakdown in our simulation. Because\nthe percolation correlation length \r changes with the field E\n\u0003or the fraction of traps with barrier less than \u0003\u0001E\u0002\u0004, it is\nreasonable to assume that C\u0001l\u0002 should be approximately con-\nstant when l=\r at different fields. Thus Eq. \u00016\u0002 can be written\nas\nC\u0001l\u0002 = exp\u0003\u2212 cLd exp\u0001\u2212 k\u0001l\/\r\u0002\u0004 . \u00017\u0002\nIn the classical percolation theory, the correlation length \r\nfollows the scaling law as15\n\r \b \u0001pc \u2212 p\u0002\u2212\u000e, \u00018\u0002\nwhere p is the fraction of conductive sites, pc is the percola-\ntion threshold, \u000e is a critical exponent, and is 0.85 for three\ndimensions\nTherefore, if the trap barrier is distributed uniformly, the\nprobability of no breakdown can be written as\nC\u0001E\u0002 = exp\f\u2212 cSl exp\f\u2212 k\u0001l\u0003\u0003c \u2212 \u0003\u0001E\u0002\u0004\u000e\r\r , \u00019\u0002\nwhere S is the sample area.\nIn a sample with fixed volume, Sl0 is a constant. Also\nconsidering Eq. \u00013\u0002, the accumulative failure probability can\nbe written as\nP\u0001E\u0002 = 1 \u2212 C\u0001E\u0002 = 1 \u2212 exp\u0003\u2212 A exp\fB\u0003\u0003c \u2212 \u0003\u0001E\u0002\u0004\u000e\r\u0004 ,\n\u000110\u0002\nwhere A and B are constants.\nIn the case of Poole\u2013Frenkel-type traps with the barriers\ndistributed uniformly, Eq. \u000110\u0002 can be written as\nP\u0001E\u0002 = 1 \u2212 exp\f\u2212 A exp\u0003B\u0001D \u2212 \u000eE\u0002\u000e\u0004\r . \u000111\u0002\nHere D is a constant.\nFigure 5 confirms that the simulation data in Fig. 2 can\nbe fitted to Eq. \u000110\u0002 very well. Here, Eq. \u000110\u0002 is different\nfrom the one derived for dielectric composites with conduc-\ntive particles,13,14 in which the conductive particles may af-\nfect the field distribution. In our model of field-assisted per-\ncolation, we assume uniform field distribution in the sample,\nand thus this model is more suitable for homogeneous mate-\nrials.\nIn the case where large defects \u0001i.e., regions with zero\nbarrier\u0002 are added with low concentration, the probability of\nno breakdown in the area containing the large defects can be\nwritten as\nC1\u0001E\u0002 = exp\f\u2212 caS\u0001l \u2212 ld\u0002exp\f\u2212 k\u0001\u0001l \u2212 ld\u0002\u0003\u0003c \u2212 \u0003\u0001E\u0002\u0004\u000e\r\r ,\n\u000112\u0002\nwhere a and ld are the concentration and size of large defects,\nrespectively.\nTherefore, the total accumulative breakdown probability\nof the sample with large defects can be written as\nP\u0001\u0001E\u0002 = 1 \u2212 exp\f\u2212 c\u00011 \u2212 a\u0002Sl exp\f\u2212 k\u0001l\u0003\u0003c \u2212 \u0003\u0001E\u0002\u0004\u000e\r\r\n\u2212 exp\f\u2212 caS\u0001l \u2212 ld\u0002exp\f\u2212 k\u0001\u0001l \u2212 ld\u0002\u0003\u0003c\n\u2212 \u0003\u0001E\u0002\u0004\u000e\r\r . \u000113\u0002\nEquation \u000113\u0002 can explain the simulation data in the cases of\nlarge sample areas in Fig. 3.\nAlthough the Weibull-distribution law fits our data well,\nour simulation model and Eqs. \u00018\u0002\u2013\u000113\u0002 have definite physi-\ncal meaning. They express the breakdown probability in\nFIG. 5. \u0001Color online\u0002 Plot of the data in the case of 1000\u00061000\u000630 in\nFig. 2 in the form of \u0001\u0003c-\u0003\u0002\u000e vs ln\u0003\u2212ln\u00011\u2212 P\u0002\u0004.

CONCLUSION\nBy expressing the disorder in morphology as randomly\ndistributed trap barriers, an approach to connect the disorder\nin polymer morphology with the stochastic nature of break-\ndown is set forward based on the field-assisted percolation\nmodel for dielectric breakdown, and an equation describing\nthe breakdown probability in terms of trap distribution is\nderived. Assuming that one simulation segment represents an\nactual length of several decades to 100 nm, the simulated\n\u0002-value of the Weibull distribution in the sample with differ-\nent thickness agrees very well with the experimental results\nof small-area samples with thickness ranging from 4 to\n14 \u0007m. The large dispersion of breakdown strength in usual\nsamples is explained in terms of defect distribution and ef-\nfective thickness to dominate initial breakdown. In aging\nprocess, the stochastic property of lifetime is not only related\nto the disorder in morphology but also related to the stochas-\ntic development of the deteriorated region.\n1S. Okabe, N.
