The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (Super-\nDARN), which consists of networks of HF radars surround-\ning the northern and southern poles, has proven to be an ex-\ntremely successful experimental technique in a wide range of\nscientific areas. The basic design of the radars, which con-\ntributes to SuperDARN, has remained virtually unchanged\nsince the first radar was built in the early 1980s. This pa-\nper presents the first results of a significant new development\nof the basic system. Termed \u201cStereo\u201d, this development in-\nvolves the addition of a duplicate receive channel and makes\nuse of the spare duty cycle available in the current transmit-\nters. The Stereo system has been implemented on the two\nradars that form the Co-operative UK Twin Located Auro-\nral Sounding System (CUTLASS), which are the eastern-\nmost pair of radars in the Northern Hemisphere SuperDARN\nchain. Instead of the standard 7 pulse sequence normally\nemployed by the radars, two such pulse sequences are inter-\nleaved and transmitted at different frequencies separated by\nmore than 15 kHz. This development allows for the radar\nto run two entirely different experimental modes simultane-\nously. Here we describe the basic Stereo system and some of\nthe early results. We also identify potential new experiments\nwhich could be run with Stereo to complement the existing\nstandard SuperDARN radar.\nKey words. Ionosphere (ionosphere-magnetosphere inter-\nactions; ionospheric irregularities; instruments and tech-\nniques)\n1 Introduction\nThe HF radars that form the Super Dual Auroral Radar Net-\nwork, SuperDARN, (Greenwald et al., 1995) have made ma-\njor contributions in a number of scientific areas.

Lester(mle@ion.le.ac.uk)\nclude, amongst others, the study of ionospheric convection\ndriven by transient reconnection, or flux transfer events (e.g.\nPinnock et al., 1993; Provan et al., 1998; Neudegg et al.,\n1999, 2000; Wild et al., 2001; Davies et al., 2002), the esti-\nmation of the reconnection rates at the dayside magnetopause\nfrom the resulting flows and changes in the location of the\npolar cap boundary (e.g. Baker et al., 1997; Chisham et al.,\n2002), the study of flows associated with optical transients in\nthe dayside cusp (e.g. Milan et al., 2000; Thorolfsson et al.,\n2000), the investigation of flows in the nightside ionosphere\nduring substorms (e.g. Yeoman et al., 2000; Bristow et al.,\n2001), the discovery of unusually high velocities in the night-\nside ionosphere (Walker et al., 1998; Senior et al., 2002; Gro-\ncott et al., 2003), the derivation of the average flow pattern\nassociated with different orientations of the interplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF) (Ruohoniemi and Greenwald, 1996),\nthe study of E-region irregularities (e.g. Milan and Lester,\n2001; Milan et al., 2001; Makarevitch et al., 2002), the in-\nvestigation of atmospheric gravity waves (e.g. Bristow et al.,\n1994; Arnold et al., 1998), the derivation of neutral winds\nfrom the scatter from ionisation trails of meteors (Hall et al.,\n1997; Arnold et al., 2001) and the study of artificially gen-\nerated irregularities using the high power radio wave trans-\nmitter, or heater, at Troms\u00f8 (Robinson et al., 1997; Yeoman\net al., 1997). Considerable effort has been placed recently in\nthe use of sophisticated analysis techniques to provide the\nglobal convection pattern at a time resolution of typically\n2 min (Ruohoniemi and Baker, 1998), as well as develop-\ning a near-real time capability for Space Weather purposes\n(e.g. Ruohoniemi et al., 2001) and investigating real time\nchannel characteristics for HF propagation (Hughes et al.,\n2002). In addition, use has been made of other parameters\nderived from the radar autocorrelation function, such as the\nspectral width, to identify the ionospheric footprint of mag-\nnetospheric boundaries (e.g. Baker et al., 1995; Dudeney et\nal., 1998; Lester et al., 2001; Woodfield et al., 2002).\n460 M. Lester et al.: Stereo CUTLASS\nFig. 1. Maps showing the fields of view of the SuperDARN radars\nin the Northern Hemisphere (top panel) and Southern Hemisphere\n(bottom panel). The CUTLASS radars, identified as E and F, form\nthe easternmost pair in the Northern Hemisphere.\nAlthough there have been many scientific advances made\nwith SuperDARN, the basic radar system has remained es-\nsentially unchanged since the first radar was built in the early\n1980s (Greenwald et al., 1985). There have been minor tech-\nnical upgrades to the basic radar design with the development\nof each new radar joining the network, largely to improve op-\nerational reliability, but there have been no significant techni-\ncal changes to the actual radar operations of the original sys-\ntem. Recently, however, there has been a development which\nsignificantly changes the way in which these radars can oper-\nate. This development, termed \u201cStereo\u201d as it effectively dou-\nbles the sounding capability of the system, has been installed\non the two radars which form the Co-operative UK Twin Lo-\ncated Auroral Sounding System (CUTLASS) at Hankasalmi\nin Finland and Pykkvibaer in Iceland. A description of this\ndevelopment, together with some of the first results and plans\nfor the future use of the Stereo system, form the basis of this\npaper.\n2 The Stereo CUTLASS system\n2.1 The original SuperDARN radar system\nBefore discussing in detail the Stereo concept and system,\nit is worthwhile reviewing the technical aspects of the ba-\nsic SuperDARN radar system (for a more complete descrip-\ntion, see Greenwald et al., 1995). Each SuperDARN radar\ncomprises a phased array radar operating in the frequency\nrange 8 to 20 MHz, although due to transmit licence consid-\nerations, the radars are constrained to operate in selected fre-\nquency bands, and in the case of the CUTLASS radars these\nare typically 100 kHz wide in approximate steps of 1 MHz.\nEach radar employs 16 horizontally polarised log periodic\nantennas, each driven by a 600 W pulse transmitter which in-\ncludes a Receive\/Transmit (Rx\/Tx) switch to allow for the\nantenna array to be used to both receive and transmit. A bi-\ndirectional beam forming network, consisting of switched,\nfixed time delays, allows any one of 16 possible pointing di-\nrections to be selected for both transmission and reception\nof signals. A dual channel receiver and a reference signal\nsource are connected via a further Rx\/Tx switch. A second,\nreceive only, interferometer array, consisting of 4 antennas\nsimilar to those in the main array, is deployed at some sites,\nto allow for the measurement of the elevation angle of the ar-\nrival of backscattered radar signals. SuperDARN radars typi-\ncally employ a seven-pulse sequence with an individual pulse\nlength of 300 microseconds, corresponding to a range resolu-\ntion of 45 km, from which the autocorrelation function (ACF)\nis determined in normal mode for ranges from 180 to at least\n3230 km, depending upon the number of gates. The Doppler\nshift is determined by a phase fitting procedure to provide\nthe line of sight velocity of the irregularities from which the\nradar signal is scattered within a range which varies from\nabout \u00b13000 m s\u22121 to \u00b11800 m s\u22121, depending upon oper-\nating frequency, with a resolution of the order of 10 m s\u22121.\nBackscatter power and spectral width are determined from a\nfunctional fit to the autocorrelation function. In normal oper-\nating mode, the radars dwell on each of the 16 beams for 7 s,\nscanning consecutively across the 16 beam directions. Each\nfull scan starts on a GPS synchronised two-minute boundary,\nto ensure that all radars in the network start the scan simulta-\nneously. An alternative high-time resolution common mode\nemploys a 3-s dwell on each beam direction and a one-minute\nsynchronization.\nCurrently, there are 9 operational SuperDARN radars in\nthe Northern Hemisphere and 6 in the Southern Hemisphere\n(Fig. 1). In the original SuperDARN concept, the radars were\nM.

Schematic representation of the Stereo system.\nlocated such that they had overlapping fields of view which\ncould provide two-dimensional measurements of the vector\nvelocity. Although all follow the same fundamental design,\nand use the same operating software, there are slight differ-\nences between the various radars, as they have been built\nover a period of 20 years, starting with the Goose Bay radar\n(Greenwald et al., 1985). The most recent radars are referred\nto as Type 3, which is a specific design configuration of a Su-\nperDARN radar developed at the University of Leicester for\nCUTLASS (radars E and F in Fig. 1, upper panel), which has\nbeen used as a basis for the implementation of several recent\nradars, e.g. TIGER (radar R in Fig. 1, lower panel) and King\nSalmon (radar C in Fig. 1, upper panel).\nThis basic system is in fact quite flexible. Different scan-\nning patterns can be performed, different range resolutions\nare possible and the distance to the first range gate can be\nchanged to investigate certain areas within the larger field of\nview. Moreover, the dwell time on a beam can be reduced to\n1 s. Despite this flexibility, the system is still limited to some\nextent. This limitation stems mainly from the success of the\nradars in being able to investigate such a diverse range of sci-\nentific topics. The main scientific objective of SuperDARN\nis to investigate the large-scale, ionospheric convection pat-\ntern, and therefore, the normal scan, with either 2-min or 1-\nmin scan times, has to be run for the bulk of the time on all\nradars. This requirement also leads to large (45 km) range\ngates, to ensure that the largest possible coverage can be\nachieved. Thus, any other scientific investigation, for exam-\nple to study artificially stimulated irregularities, with higher\ntemporal resolution and improved range resolution, or ULF\nwaves, with higher time resolution, tends to have a lower pri-\nority. In order to allow for such studies to be undertaken, a\nproportion of time (currently up to 50%) each month is de-\nvoted to non-standard experimental modes.\n2.2 The Stereo system\nStereo CUTLASS was developed to provide both additional\nflexibility to the basic system, as well as to improve the\ntemporal resolution of the basic CUTLASS SuperDARN\nradars. Stereo relies on the capability of the transmitters in\nType 3 SuperDARN radars to operate at duty cycles of at\nleast 7%, twice that required for normal SuperDARN opera-\ntions. Stereo essentially consists of two radar channels, each\nof which is able to transmit and receive independent signals\nbut which share common transmitters, antennas and control\nsystem. Radar pulses from each channel are differentiated\nby their frequency, and it is necessary to use separate signal\ngeneration, beam forming and receivers in each of the two\nchannels. The common components, however, constitute the\nmajor capital cost within a SuperDARN radar so Stereo is\nsignificantly cheaper than two radars.\nThe Stereo implementation is illustrated in Fig. 2, which is\na functional representation of the complete system. The com-\n462 M. Lester et al.: Stereo CUTLASS\nponents of the system which are common to both channels\nare in white, while the elements which are required for each\nchannel are shown in blue (channel A) and green (channel B).\nThe original configuration is extended by the duplication of\nthe phasing matrix, receiver and transmit signal generation.\nA new version of an interface box, termed a \u201cBAS box\u201d,\nwhich was originally a hardwired patch panel providing con-\nvenient interconnection of control signals throughout the sys-\ntem, has been developed. The Stereo BAS box adds arbitra-\ntion logic to protect the system from requests to transmit on\nboth channels simultaneously and to ensure that the Rx\/Tx\nswitch in each Stereo channel is set with regard to transmit\nrequests in both channels. By default, both channels are able\nto receive simultaneously but neither channel is able to re-\nceive whilst either of the channels is transmitting. The new\nStereo BAS box also incorporates remote monitoring of po-\ntential conflicts detected by the arbitration logic, as well as\nthe aggregated duty cycle, operating frequency and beam di-\nrection.\nA second analogue to digital (A\/D) interface is provided\nwithin the main computer, to allow for the additional four\nchannels of analogue In-phase and Quadrature (I\/Q) signals,\nfor both the main and interferometer receivers to be simulta-\nneously sampled. The original timing computer, which acts\nas a programmable timing signal generator, includes the abil-\nity to generate the required signals for both Stereo channels.\nThe most recent version of the radar operating system, RST,\ndeveloped at the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), Johns\nHopkins University, includes the ability to operate Stereo\nCUTLASS, as well as normal SuperDARN radars.\nIn operation, Stereo sets the beam direction for each of\nthe two channels, which may be the same or different, by\nsending the appropriate control signals to the two phasing\nmatrices. The timing computer generates individual, non-\noverlapping pulse sequences for each of the two channels.\nThe conceptually simplest arrangement is to use the same\npulse pattern on both channels, with one delayed with re-\nspect to the other by a time greater than a single pulse period,\nwhich is 300 microseconds in normal mode. These pulse\nsequences generate equivalent RF drive signals at different\ntransmit frequencies, and these are routed through the phas-\ning matrices and Rx\/Tx switches to the transmitters which\ngenerate the appropriately phased signals in the antenna ar-\nray. When not transmitting, the received signals are routed\nback through the phasing matrices to the receivers and the\ndown converted signals are sampled by the main computer.\nThe autocorrelation function for each pulse sequence is av-\neraged over the dwell period, and the normal procedures are\nused to determine power, velocity and spectral width param-\neters for both of the Stereo channels. The process continues\nfor as many pointing directions as required in an individual\nscan and the interleaved data from both Stereo channels are\nrecorded to disk.\nStereo CUTLASS provides effectively two equivalent in-\ndependent radars, though this system does have some lim-\nitations caused by hardware constraints. The two channels\nmust operate at different frequencies to ensure that backscat-\ntered signals from one channel are not confused with those\nfrom the other channel. The CUTLASS radars have lim-\nited frequency bands in which they can operate which are\noften not wider than 100 kHz. If Stereo CUTLASS oper-\nates both channels in the same frequency band, the separation\nin frequency must be greater than the receiver bandwidth of\n15 kHz. It is also possible for Stereo to operate in two en-\ntirely different frequency bands.\n2.3 Impact of Stereo on the AutoCorrelation Function\n(ACF)\nOne of the major concerns for the new system is the poten-\ntial impact on the ACF, which is formulated by constructing\na set of \u201clags\u201d from the pulse sequence. Some of these lags,\nreferred to as \u201cbad lags\u201d, can be missing or non-physical, and\nthese are caused by a variety of mechanisms. Two of these\nmechanisms are independent of the second pulse train while\nthe third is very much dependent upon both pulse trains,\nand hence, the impact of additional pulse trains, such as that\nfound in the Stereo system, has to be considered.\nMulti-pulse radars, such as those which form part of Su-\nperDARN, coherently integrate over a number of pulse se-\nquences to derive the ACF. Since signals from different\nranges are random with respect to signals from the same\nrange but arising from different pulses, averaging leaves only\ninformation about temporal changes within a single range\ngate and gives rise to a minimum temporal resolution of order\n1 s for SuperDARN radars, corresponding to approximately\n10 pulse sequences. Additional processing, however, is re-\nquired to overcome problems when signals from other ranges\nfor specific lag times are significantly greater than those from\nthe wanted range cell and where significant contamination of\nthe ACF must be identified and removed. Cross range noise\nis illustrated in the lower panel of Fig. 3, where the stan-\ndard pulse sequence is represented by the small vertical lines\njust beneath the main panel. The diagonal lines represent\nthe propagation of selected pulses (1\u20135) outward from the\nradar and back again after scattering from selected ranges.\nThe smallest interpulse period for this pulse sequence is\n2400 microseconds and for the complete pulse sequence to\nbe received from all 70 range gates takes 88 milliseconds.\nWe see that the second pulse from range gate 45 is received\nuniquely, whereas that from range gate 31 arrives at the same\ntime as the third pulse from range gate 7. Other similar exam-\nples are also shown with pulses 4 and 5, which demonstrate\nthat this can happen at a variety of different range gates and\npulses in the train. The major problem occurs when there is\npower being received from both range gates, as the receiver\ncannot then distinguish between the two. The extra pulses\nfrom Stereo do not impact here, provided that the separation\nof the two pulse trains is not an integer multiplier of the basic\nlag separation. The other problem that is not exacerbated by\nthe Stereo operation is the occurrence of non-physical ACFs.\nSince we expect the ACF to decay in amplitude, then addi-\ntional power than expected at later lags would cause such an\nACF. Such additional power might be caused by interference\nM.

Range time plot for the standard pulse sequence at a basic pulse separation of 2400 microseconds, together with the standard pulse\nsequence and the Stereo pulse sequence. The top panel illustrates the problem associated with bad lags generated by the overlap of the receipt\nof a pulse and the transmission of a pulse. The lower panel illustrates the problem of cross range noise.\nfrom another HF source. Both these bad lag mechanisms are\naccounted for in the standard SuperDARN ACF fitting soft-\nware (termed fitacf).\nThe mechanism which might seriously impact Stereo op-\nerations results from the inability to receive and transmit si-\nmultaneously. This is illustrated in the top panel of Fig. 3,\nwhich is in the same format as the lower panel. If we con-\nsider the first pulse of the sequence, we see that it is received\nfrom the first range gate (identified as gate 0) a short time\nafter the pulse has been transmitted. This is not a problem,\nas there are no other pulses being transmitted at that time.\nIf, however, we consider the second pulse propagated out to\ngate 20 and scattered back to the radar, we see that it is re-\nceived at a time when the third pulse is being transmitted.\nSince the Stereo system is unable to transmit and receive at\nthe same time, the second pulse from this range will not be\nreceived. Likewise, the third pulse for gate 60 is received at\nthe time that the fourth pulse in the sequence is being trans-\nmitted. Thus, for certain gates there will be certain pulses\nwhich are not received and, therefore, certain lags will not be\nable to be formed in the autocorrelation function. By increas-\ning the number of pulses being sent, the number of occasions\nwhen a pulse cannot be received is increased. The missing\nlags caused by this problem are easily predicted and do not\nnormally prevent data fitting, provided that the fitting pro-\ncess takes them intoaccount.

Range time velocity plots of the line of sight velocity measured between 08:00 and 10:00 UT on 17 November 2000 on beam 8 of\nthe Hankasalmi radar. The top panel presents data from channel A and the lower panel from channel B. The radar was alternating between\nmono and stereo operation, the start times of which are illustrated by dashed vertical lines in the top panel. Ground scatter is coded as grey.\nto existing SuperDARN analysis software has been made for\nStereo system operations. The Stereo pulse sequence, with\na separation of 800 microseconds between pulse trains, is\nshown below the standard pulse sequence in Fig. 3. Note\nthat 800\u00b5s is chosen for clarity in the figure, while 400\u00b5s is\ntypically used in Stereo operations.\nThe impact of not being able to receive and transmit simul-\ntaneously is further illustrated in Fig. 4, where we present\nDoppler velocity data from an early test run of Stereo in\nwhich the Finland radar was switched between mono and\nStereo operation every 15 min. The upper panel of Fig. 4\npresents data from Channel 1 of Stereo, which also includes\nthe data from the mono operation, while the data from Chan-\nnel 2 of Stereo is presented in the lower panel. The switch\nfrom mono to Stereo operation is clearly defined by the exis-\ntence of data in the lower panel. The data have been analysed\nusing the original version of the software, to identify the \u201cbad\nlags\u201d. The experimental mode run during this test run was a\nsimple normal scan on channel A, while on channel B, during\nthe stereo part of the experiment, the radar simply \u201ccamped\u201d\non one beam, beam 8, and hence, the data in the lower panel\nis at a higher time resolution than that in the upper panel.\nFirst, it is important to note that there is no clear difference\nin channel A between the data from the mono and Stereo op-\nerations. Thus, we see that there is no significant impact on\nthe channel A data. Investigating the lower panel of Fig. 4 we\nM. Lester et al.: Stereo CUTLASS 465\nsee that there are two main effects. The first is the band of\napparent scatter at the first range, which is clearly an instru-\nmental effect and can be removed by suitable choice of the\noffset between the two channels. The second effect concerns\nrange gates where there has been no fit to the data due to an\nincrease in the number of bad lags identified by the analysis\nsoftware. These are identified as horizontal lines where no\nsignal appears to have been measured at a fixed range gate\ndespite the range gate being in the middle of either iono-\nspheric or ground scatter. In later figures we present data\nwhich have been analysed with the modified software men-\ntioned above and although such regions do exist, the num-\nber has been reduced. Thus, although the impact is small,\naffecting approximately 6 range gates out of 70, it is still ob-\nservable and demonstrates the need for the modified analysis\nsoftware for Stereo operations.\n3 Observational results\nSuperDARN radars have demonstrated the unique ability to\ngenerate maps of irregularities with high-time resolution over\nextended regions during normal operation. This ability is\nsignificantly enhanced by the second Stereo channel, which\nmay be programmed to provide additional information with-\nout impacting normal scanning. Some of the possible appli-\ncations are as follows:\n\u2013 The ability to operate at two frequencies to maximise\ncoverage, otherwise limited due to HF propagation con-\nditions.\n\u2013 The provision of a second beam with either a fixed look\ndirection with temporal resolution of up to one second\nor a limited beam scan to provide simultaneous spatial\nand temporal views.\n\u2013 Interleaved beam scanning using both channels to de-\ncrease the full scan time down to 8 s (with 1-s dwell\ntime on each beam).\n\u2013 The provision of a second channel with different range\nresolution or range extent.\n\u2013 The ability to program the second channel to extract\nneutral wind velocity from meteor scatter whilst mak-\ning standard measurements on the first channel.\nWe now illustrate the capabilities of the Stereo system with\nsome examples of the data collected to date when Stereo\nhas been operated in a variety of modes. It should be men-\ntioned that it is not the purpose to provide a detailed scientific\nanalysis of the data here, but simply to illustrate the capa-\nbility of the Stereo system. Where applicable, reference is\nmade to papers where a more detailed scientific analysis is\npresented.\n3.1 High time resolution single beam and full scan\nThe mode which has been run most often during the initial\noperations of Stereo is a standard full scan on channel A, i.e.\n7-s dwell time and 2-min scan time, with a single beam on\nchannel B. The single beam on channel B has a time reso-\nlution of 7 s, comparable with magnetometer measurements.\nRange Time Parameter plots of backscatter power, line of\nsight velocity, and spectral width from such a run are pre-\nsented in Fig. 5 from Hankasalmi (Fig. 5a) and Pykkvibaer\n(Fig. 5b). In this run, the single beam on channel B cho-\nsen for Hankasalmi was beam 9 (Fig. 5a, right-hand column)\nwhile for Pykkvibaer it was beam 5 (Fig. 5b, right-hand col-\numn). The left-hand columns present data from the same two\nbeams but from the standard mode. We see from the data pre-\nsented in Fig. 5 that the agreement between the two beams is\ngood, as expected. However, we also note that there is con-\nsiderably more detail in the high-time resolution data which\ncannot be obtained from the standard scan.\nThis extra detail is demonstrated more clearly in Fig 6,\nwhere line plots for a single range cell are presented in the\nsame format as in Fig 5. In Fig. 6a, the Hankasalmi data\nfrom gate 31 of beam 9 from the channel A full scan (left-\nhand column) demonstrate that the line of sight velocity was\nof the order of 500 m s\u22121 for much of the selected one-hour\ninterval (03:00\u201304:00 UT). The channel B high-time reso-\nlution beam (right-hand column) clearly indicates that while\nthis is true, there is much more structure than could previ-\nously be recognized. The same is true of the spectral width\nparameter, shown in the bottom panel of each column. This\nobservation is further supported by the data from Fig. 6b,\nwhere Pykkvibaer data are presented for the interval 01:30 to\n03:00 UT. A difference between the spectral width data early\non in the interval, between 01:45 and 01:55 UT, is quite clear,\nindicating that structure can be missed with the full scan.\nIn the full scan data the values are initially of the order of\n200 m s\u22121, but the high-time resolution mode indicates that\nthe spectral width is often greater than 300 m s\u22121 and can\nreach 600 m s\u22121. Such a result may be of importance when\nusing the spectral width parameter to identify regions such as\nthe cusp (e.g. Baker et al., 1995) or polar cap boundary (e.g.\nLester et al., 2001; Woodfield et al., 2002).\n3.2 Comparison of 45-km and 15-km range gates\nAs mentioned earlier, in normal operation the SuperDARN\nradars operate a 7-pulse sequence with an individual pulse\nlength of 300 microseconds, which is equivalent to a range\nresolution of 45 km. The range to the first gate is normally\n180 km, and 70 gates are normally recorded. The individ-\nual pulse length can be reduced to 200 or 100 microseconds,\nequivalent to range gates of length 30 or 15 km, respec-\ntively, but 70 gates are still recorded. The reduction in gate\nlength, therefore, has the disadvantage currently of reducing\nthe overall spatial coverage. A number of modes require the\nability to run with higher spatial resolution.

Range time parameter plots for observations made from 00:00 to 02:00 UT on 14 June 2002. The basic format is the same as in Fig. 5\nwith channel A in the left-hand column and channel B in the right-hand column. For channel A we present 25 45-km range gates, while for\nchannel B there are 70 15-km range gates which overlap with the gates shown from channel A.\n(e.g. Robinson et al., 1997) and also to study E-region irregu-\nlarities (e.g. Milan et al., 2001). However, when operating in\nthis mode the full field of view of the radar is lost. The Stereo\nsystem can operate such that one channel has a range reso-\nlution of 15 km and the other of 45 km, thereby allowing us\nto retain the large field of view when operating at improved\nrange resolution.\nFigure 7 presents range time parameter plots for beam 15\nfrom the Hankasalmi CUTLASS radar for the two channels\nof Stereo for the interval 00:00\u201302:00 UT on 14 June 2002.\nIn the left column we present the power, line of sight veloc-\nity, and spectral width from channel A for the range gates\nbetween 20 and 45. The range resolution for channel A is\n45 km. The right column of Fig. 6 presents the same parame-\nters for the same time interval but from channel B which was\noperating with a 15 km range resolution. Here we present all\nrange gates. In this mode, the range to the first range gate\nfor channel A was 180 km and for channel B it was arranged\nsuch that the 70 15-km range gates of channel B spanned\ngates 20 to 43 of channel A, thereby essentially overlapping\nwith the gates shown in the left-hand panels of Fig. 7. A\nmixture of ground and ionospheric scatter is seen during this\ninterval, with the ground scatter identified when the magni-\ntude of the line of sight velocity is less than 50 m s\u22121 and\nthe spectral width is less than 50 m s\u22121 (see Greenwald et al.,\n1995), and plotted as grey in the panels presenting velocity\nmeasurements in Fig. 7. We note that the power in channel B\nis normally less than that in channel A, which we shall return\nto later. The line of sight velocity and spectral width, how-\never, both indicate a good comparison between the two sets\nof data. There is again extra detail present from the improved\nspatial resolution in the gates from channel B. We also note\ntwo range gates, 31 and 55, where there is no data which is\ncaused by bad lags at these ranges.\nThe comparison between the two data sets is further\ndemonstrated in Fig. 8, where we plot the value determined\nfrom the 45 km range gate for channel A against the aver-\nage value from the three equivalent gates from channel B,\nfor each of the three parameters shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 8\nwe have used data from all 16 beams of the scan, but we\npresent only scatter which has been identified as ionospheric\nscatter in both channels. Concentrating first on the line of\nsight velocity (Fig. 8, central panel), we see that the velocity\nis clearly in good agreement between the two data sets. Like-\nwise, the spectral width (Fig. 8, lower panel) shows a similar\ngood agreement, although there is a \u201ctail\u201d of high values for\nchannel B. The returned power of the signal (Fig. 8, upper\npanel) clearly demonstrates the reduction in power in chan-\nnel B as compared to channel A. The figure demonstrates\nthat this reduction is of the order of 10 dB. Such a reduction\nis expected since the channel A range gate is three times the\nsize of that of channel B, and there should be three times\nM.

Scatter plots of the backscatter power, line of sight velocity and spectral width of the ionospheric scatter from the interval shown in\nFig. 7. Data from all 16 beams are presented and the data from the 45-km range gate have been compared with the average value for the\nthree overlapping 15-km range gates. Only scatter identified as ionospheric scatter have been presented.\nthe number of scatterers within a 45-km gate compared to a\n15-km gate. This observation confirms the previous assump-\ntion that, in the case of ionospheric scatter, the irregularities,\nfrom which the radar signal is backscattered, are, in general,\napproximately uniformly distributed within a range gate.\n3.3 E-region irregularities\nA number of studies of E-region irregularities have been un-\ndertaken with the Pykkvibear CUTLASS radar (e.g. Milan\nand Lester, 2001; Milan et al., 2001). These studies have\nused a discretionary experimental mode, termed Myopic, in\nwhich the radar operates solely with a range resolution of\n15 km and a dwell time on each beam of 3 s. The first non-\nCommon Mode to be run with Stereo involved a run of My-\nopic, in which channel A operated at 10 MHz, while chan-\nnel B changed the frequency at which it operated on con-\nsecutive scans. The frequency bands were 8, 12, 14, 16 and\n18 MHz. The main purpose of this experiment was to in-\nvestigate the wave number dependence of the ionospheric\nirregularity characteristics. Results from this first study have\nbeen presented elsewhere (Milan et al., 2003), but here we\npresent a simple representation of a major new finding from\nthis study.\n470 M. Lester et al.: Stereo CUTLASS\nFig. 9. In the top two panels the line\nof sight velocity from the two channels\nare presented for the same scan starting\nat 18:44:57 during a run of the Myopic\nexperiment. Channel A (left panel) was\noperating at 10 MHz, while channel B\n(right panel) was operating at 14 MHz.\nThe lower panel presents a scatter plot\nof the data shown in the upper two pan-\nels.\nFigure 9 presents the line of sight velocity from the scan\nstarting at 18:44:57 UTF for channel A, upper left panel, and\nchannel B, upper right panel, as a function of range gate and\nbeam. The curved lines superposed on each of these plots\nrepresent magnetic latitude and magnetic local time (MLT)\nco-ordinates. Channel A was operating at the constant fre-\nquency of 10 MHz, while channel B was operating at 14 MHz\nfor this particular scan. Based on interferometer data the\nscatter in the nearest range gates, out to gate 45, is from\nthe E-region, while the scatter from further gates is from the\nF-region. Here we concentrate solely on the E-region scat-\nter. We note, that although the general location in range and\nbeam of the scatter is very similar for the two frequencies,\nthere is a major difference in the line of sight velocity at\nrange gates greater than 30 for beams 3 to 12. The line of\nsight velocity here is significantly larger at 14 MHz than that\nat 10 MHz. Elsewhere, the line of sight velocity is very simi-\nlar at the two frequencies. The lower panel of Fig. 9 presents\na scatter plot of the data shown in the upper panel. There\nare essentially three distributions, one where the velocity is\nsimilar at the two frequencies, the second where the velocity\nat 14 MHz is much higher than that at 10 MHz, and a third,\nsmaller population, which occurs in a band at near ranges,\nwhere the opposite is true.\nMilan et al. (2003) argue that the region of the high ve-\nlocity scatter at 14 MHz is from a higher altitude than the\nsimilar region at 10 MHz. The different frequency allows for\nthe radar to probe a different altitude regime. The exact rea-\nson for the enhancement in the velocity, however, is not clear\nand requires further experimental and theoretical investiga-\nM. Lester et al.: Stereo CUTLASS 471\ntion. Although a population of scatter from higher altitudes\nhad been postulated previously by Milan et al. (2001), based\non other information, this is the first opportunity to provide\ncompelling experimental evidence for such an effect, as we\nare able to probe different altitudes with the two different fre-\nquencies due to the refraction of the radar signal as it prop-\nagates through the E-region plasma. It is important to point\nout that other experiments involving frequency scans would\nnot be able to clearly demonstrate velocity differences, such\nas that presented in Fig. 9, as the time to repeat 6 different\nfrequencies would be of the order of 5 min, assuming a 3-s\ndwell time and no sychronisation. Only with the Stereo capa-\nbility can one unambiguously demonstrate such a difference.\n4 Potential experimental modes\nThe observations presented earlier have illustrated a number\nof possible experimental modes. Here we outline potential\nexperimental modes which can be employed with this sys-\ntem, and of which there are three basic types. In the first,\nthe system can be used to improve the temporal resolution,\nwhile in the second the system can be used more to improve\nthe spatial resolution without losing spatial coverage, or to\nincrease the spatial coverage of backscatter. The third type of\nexperiment that the system can address is where two different\ntypes of experimental modes are operated simultaneously.\nThe improvement in the temporal resolution can be\nachieved in two basic ways. In the first, a single beam, or\nsubset of beams, can be used on the second channel to sup-\nport the standard mode running in the first channel, much\nlike the experiment discussed in Sect. 3.1. This type of ex-\nperiment would be ideal to investigate ULF waves with fre-\nquencies higher than Pc5 pulsations. The second way is to\nbreak down the field of view into two parts, such that the two\nchannels can then be merged subsequently to give a complete\nfield of view. This would reduce the temporal resolution for\nthe complete scan by a factor of two, which could mean 30-s\nscans, if a dwell time of 3 s is used for each beam, and at best\n8-s scans with dwell times of 1 s.\nImprovements in spatial resolution can be achieved, in\ngeneral, by reducing the pulse length, and we have demon-\nstrated that the results from a 15-km range gate are simi-\nlar to those of a 45-km range gate for line of sight velocity\nand spectral width. This has the disadvantage, already men-\ntioned, that the total coverage of the field of view is reduced.\nExperiments have been run to look with higher spatial res-\nolution for certain types of study. For example, the Myopic\nmode has been used to study E-region irregularities, at the\nexpense of providing the full scan for the global convection\nmaps. When using the CUTLASS radars in support of Heater\nexperiments at Troms\u00f8, the smaller range resolution is also\nused, as the heater patch is limited to an approximately cir-\ncular region of about 150 km diameter (e.g. Robinson et al.,\n1997). The spatial coverage can be recovered in full using\nStereo, either with 45-km range gates being used in the sec-\nond channel, or partially recovered with 15-km range gates\nwith a different range to the first gate. It may also be pos-\nsible to improve the coverage of scatter in certain circum-\nstances by operating the two channels at widely different fre-\nquencies, such that different parts of the field of view are\nilluminated by the two channels. In addition, the frequency\ncould be selected such that ground scatter can be optimized to\ninvestigate Atmospheric Gravity Waves (e.g. Bristow et al.,\n1994), while simultaneously using a different frequency to\noptimize ionospheric scatter and to ensure continued global\nmeasurements of the global convection pattern.\nThe most impressive possibility, however, is the capabil-\nity of being able to run in two entirely different experimen-\ntal modes. The main difference here would be that different\npulse sequences would be transmitted for the two different\nchannels. One might envisage that for certain scientific stud-\nies, a simple double pulse sequence would be sufficient. Such\na pulse sequence could easily be incorporated into the Stereo\ncapability, since the basic pulse separation could be achieved\nby just using the basic pulse separation of the current se-\nquence, i.e. 2400 microseconds. Other more complex pulse\nsequences may also be employed, although the one limitation\nis that there could be no overlapping of pulses to be transmit-\nted on both channels. The use of different pulse schemes\nmay be particularly useful when studying irregularity gen-\neration mechanisms or artificial ionospheric scatter created\nduring heating experiments. This will become particularly\nimportant in support of the new heater on Svalbard, SPEAR\n(Wright et al., 2000).\n5 Summary\nA new capability has been developed for the HF radars which\nform SuperDARN. This capability, known as Stereo, is only\noperational at the moment on the two radars which form\nCUTLASS. The development allows for the CUTLASS pair\nof radars to be operated in two entirely different experimen-\ntal modes, within limits, thereby considerably enhancing the\nperformance of the existing system, at a small extra cost.\nThe system has been demonstrated with a variety of differ-\nent types of experimental modes. Specifically, we have pre-\nsented data from a run where high time resolution data have\nbeen recorded simultaneously with full scan data, which was\na specific reason for the development of the Stereo system. In\naddition, we have demonstrated the ability to operate the two\nchannels at different range gate lengths, illustrating a flexi-\nbility that will be required when undertaking heating experi-\nments. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that scientifically\nimportant observations can also be made when operating the\ntwo channels at widely different frequencies.\nAcknowledgements.
