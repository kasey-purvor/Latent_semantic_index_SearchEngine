INTRODUCTION \nIncreasingly stringent regulations for emissions from \nautomotive vehicles has led to a resurgence of research \nactivity to realize alternative electrically driven power-trains \nwith comparable performance attributes to their internal \ncombustion engine counterparts. The development of \nvehicles with electrically actuated wheels has made it \npossible to develop anti-lock braking\/traction control \n(ABS\/TC) strategies, due to the inherent localized control \nof wheel torque. \n \nThe objective of ABS controller is to control the wheel slip \nat some optimum value.  ABS\/ traction control dynamics \ntend to be non-linear, time varying and complicated, thus \nresulting in a complicated classical control system. The \nperformance of classical ABS\/traction control systems is \noften limited by the mechanical bandwidth of the active \nactuation systems (typically 20Hz \u0096\u201325 Hz for ABS).  In \nelectrically powered vehicles the torque output of the motor \nis directly proportional to the current [1], hence ABS\/ \ntraction control systems can be designed to provide greater \nfrequency bandwidths.  \n \nAnother major obstacle to the development of a robust \nABS\/traction control system has always been the real-time  \n                                                           \n  The principle author is currently a Product Design Engineer  with Ford \nMotor Company.  The subject matter of this paper was originally studied \nas part of her PhD research at the University of Sheffield, UK.

Recent investigations have applied \nobserver\/estimation schemes to obtain real-time estimated \ndata indirectly, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has \nreceived increased attention [3].  However, published \nmaterial to-date is primarily derived from simulation \nstudies, with practical implementation and validation of the \ntechniques being rare.  Current commercial\/passenger \nvehicles incorporating ABS\/traction control systems often \nemploy look-up tables that are based on the results of \nexperimental trials, and have been shown to provide \ninadequate performance under many driving situations.  \nThis technique however, is limited by the fixed range of \ncontrol parameters, and is often \u0091\u2018de-tuned\u0092\u2019 to accommodate \nworst-case scenarios, for example, traction control in icy \nconditions with old tires.  Consequently, a sub-optimal \nwheel-slip characteristic is imposed for most driving \nconditions.  This constitutes the safest criteria for design \npurposes, resulting in imposition of conservative limits on \nthe traction available under higher adhesion coefficient (\u00b5) \nsurfaces.  Hence, optimal benefits of the traction controller \nare often not realised in classical control strategies.  In this \npaper a robust and efficient ABS\/traction control system \nusing fuzzy logic algorithms is described.  Thus \ncircumventing the issues imposed by the limiting control \nparameters in classical control.  \n \nFor the purpose of clarity, a background material of the \nABS\/ traction control system is given in section II.  Section \nIII, shows the experimental set-up using the induction \nmachine in generator mode torque-slip characteristics \nprovides a platform for simulating a variety of tire\/road \ncoefficient of friction vs. slip (\u00b5  vs.  s) driving conditions.  \nSection IV, describes fuzzy logic ABS\/ traction control \nalgorithms and implementation in the experimental set-up.  \nFinally, section V presents the data analysis obtained from \nsimulation studies and experimental test. \nII. TRACTION CONTROL \/ ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEMS  \nThe tractive force (FL) between a tire and the road surface \n(Figure 1) is proportional to the normal load, (Fz), the \nconstant of proportionality being termed the adhesion \ncoefficient (\u00b5.).  The adhesion coefficient \u00b5, is the ratio of \nAn Experimental Laboratory Bench Setup to \nStudy Electric Vehicle Antilock Braking  \/ \nTraction Systems and their Control \n0-7803-7467-3\/02\/$17.00 \u00a92002 IEEE. 1490\ntire brake force at the tire road interface and the normal load \nacting on the tire, i.e: \nZ\nL\nF\nF\n=\u00b5    (1) \n \nFigure 1. Wheel model [4]. \nThe value of \u00b5 is highly dependent on tire characteristics \n(compound, wear, ageing etc) and road surface conditions \n(dry, icy, gravel, tarmac etc), although it can be primarily \nregarded as a function of the relative slip, s, between the \ntwo contacting surfaces.   Slip is defined as the normalised \ndifference between the wheel speed and the contact point \nspeed: \nv\nRvs \u03c9\u2212=\n  (2) \nwhere v is the vehicle velocity, R is the effective radius of \nthe driven wheel, and \u03c9 is the angular velocity of the wheel.  \nTypical \u00b5-s characteristics are shown in Figure 2. \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Example \u00b5-s characteristics for various road conditions [ 5]. \n \nIn the control region, Figure 2 demonstrates that an increase \nin slip can increase the tractive force between the tire and \nroad surface by virtue of an increase in \u00b5.  However, once \nthe peak (\u00b5max ) of the characteristic is encountered, any \nfurther increase in slip will reduce traction, and \nconsequently induce an unstable acceleration of the wheel \nuntil the drive torque is reduced. \n \nThe objective of an antilock braking system (ABS) is to \nmanipulate the tractive force applied to the driven wheels in \norder to limit the slip, s, between the road surface and the \ntire, and consequently only operate within the stable control \nregion of the \u00b5-slip characteristic. An obstacle in the design \nof ABS control schemes is the determination in real-time of \n\u00b5-slip characteristics, i.e. \u00b5max and slip. Table 1 shows \ntypical values of slip required to obtain the maximum \nadhesion coefficient, for various road conditions. \n \nRoad \ncondition \nMax. adhesion \ncoefficient (\u00b5max) \nOptimum \nslip (s) \nDry Road 0.85 0.35 \nWet Road 0.4 0.2 \nIcy Road 0.2 0.1 \n \nTable 1. Max. values of \u00b5 for various road surfaces [5]. \nMany manufacturers employ a slip-limiting control scheme \nfor ABS\/ traction control to account for \u0091\u2018worst-case\u0092\u2019 \nconditions, typically the icy road parameters (\u00b5max, slip).  \nAlthough this constitutes the safest criteria for design \npurposes, it can impose conservative limits on the traction \navailable under less severe conditions [6]. A second issue \noften encountered by designers of  ABS\/ traction control \nschemes, is the inadequacy of appropriate test-tracks\/skid-\npans or other experimental rolling road facilities \n(experimental setup) to evaluate proposed algorithms and \nprovide repeatable conditions for comparative studies as \ndescribed in the following section. \nIII. EXPERIMENTAL TEST FACILITY  \nA low cost experimental test bench was developed.  The test \nfacility illustrated in Figure 3, comprises of an electric \ntraction drive, which represents the vehicle drive and is \nconnected to a three-phase induction machine, which is used \nto imitate the road load, and develop and test control \nalgorithms. \n \n \nFigure 3. DSP based experimental test facilities. \nThe experimental electric traction drive is a 6kW \ncontinuous, 12kW peak rated brushless permanent magnet \nmotor supplied via a power controller from a 72V high \nperformance Nickel Cadmium traction battery. The power \nelectronic controller is constructed using three independent \nMOSFET \/ IGBT H-bridge [7] and is capable of full four-\nquadrant operation. In the prototype electric vehicle, the \ntraction motor is connected to the wheels via a step-down \ngearstage.  However, for the test-bench, only steady state \noperations were carried out.  The brushless permanent \nmagnet motor is directly coupled to a 2.2kW, 50Hz, 3-\nphase, 6-pole, induction machine, the angular velocity of the \nconnecting shaft being monitored via an optical shaft \n0-7803-7467-3\/02\/$17.00 \u00a92002 IEEE. 1491\nencoder interface.  The induction motor is connected to the \nutility supply via a variac (allowing the supply voltage to be \nadjusted). To facilitate the implementation of the developed \ncontrol schemes, a custom state-of-the-art, DSP hardware \nplatform was designed, based on the TMS320C31 floating-\npoint processor, to integrate the system control algorithms \nwith sensor interfaces, man-machine interface\u0092\u2019s, monitoring, \nand supervisory tasks. A foreground\/background \ndistribution of 'non-time-critical' and \u0091\u2018time-critical\u0092\u2019 \nfunctions has been employed to ensure the controller \nremains a high integrity process.  \n \nThe key principle of operation of the test facility for ABS\/ \ntraction control is based on the relationship between \u00b5-slip \ncharacteristics of tire - road interactions( Figure 2), and  \ntorque-slip characteristics of the induction machine  (Figure \n4).The brushless PM motor acts as the prime-mover and \ndrives the induction machine into the generator region of \noperation, thereby inducing a negative slip with respect to \nsynchronous speed (1000rpm @ 50 Hz in this case).  As the \ntorque demand to the PM machine is raised further, the slip \nbecomes increasingly negative, and the induction machine \ndevelops an opposing torque, eventually resulting in a stable \nsteady-state condition.   \n \n \n \nFigure 4. Induction machine torque-slip characteristics. \nThis procedure can continue up to the pushover torque limit \nof the induction machine.  A subsequent increase in applied \ntorque will then further decrease the slip, forcing the system \ninto an unstable operating region.  Thus, the induction \nmachine is not able to oppose the applied torque, and a \nrunaway condition is encountered with the brushless motor \naccelerating uncontrollably.  This is analogous to the \nclassical \u00b5-s characteristics encountered in traction control \nsystems when the slip at \u00b5max is exceeded.  An algorithm \nthat controls the torque developed by the brushless PM \nmotor to maintain the induction machine in the \u0091\u2018stable-slip\u0092\u2019 \nregion of operation, is also to be a good candidate to control \nthe torque applied to the wheels to maintain tractive force in \nthe stable region. The steady state torque-slip characteristic \nis obtained from the equivalent circuit of an induction \nmachine as: \n (3) \n \nwhere:V is the applied voltage, R1 is the stator resistance, R2 \nis the rotor resistance referred to the stator, s is the slip, \n\u03c9sync is the synchronous speed, X1  is the stator leakage \nreactance, X2 is the rotor leakage reactance referred to the \nstator. \n \nThe magnitude and shape of the torque-slip characteristics \nis dependent upon the supply voltage and impedance. By \nadjusting the voltage and impedance, a wide range of \ntire\/road conditions can be simulated. The induction \nmachine torque-slip characteristic (Figure 4) is calibrated to \nmatch the tire slip-adhesion characteristic (Figure 2). \nDuring the operation of an induction machine at 0 slip the \nsystem is stable and at 100% the system is locked.  This is \nanalogous to the braking process of a vehicle, where a \nwheel can rotate freely with slip at 0 or be locked at slip \nequal to 1. It is noted that, due to the unsymmetrical nature \nof induction machine characteristics, different parameters \n(voltage and frequency) for exciting the induction machine \nare required to simulate ABS and traction control systems. \n \nIV. FUZZY LOGIC ABS\/ TRACTION CONTROL \nTo address the braking operation at 0 to 100 % slip, a \nfuzzy-based technique was employed to develop control \nalgorithms.  One of the strengths of fuzzy systems is their \nability to express a confidence in reasoning results.  Recent \nstudies [8] have shown that fuzzy control algorithms are \npart of a class of universal approximators of continuous \nfunctions. The advantage of fuzzy control is that there are \nmany instances where TRUE and FALSE or ON and OFF \nfail to describe a given situation. These cases require a \nsliding scale where variables can be measured as PARTLY \nON or MOSTLY TRUE and PARTLY FALSE. \n  \nTraditional set theory is based on bivalent logic where an \nobject is either a member of a set, or not. However, with \nfuzzy logic, an object can be a member of multiple sets with \na different degree of membership in each set. A degree of \nmembership in a set is based on a scale from 0 to 1, 1 being \ncomplete membership and 0 being no membership. In fuzzy \nlogic traction control, an output (the torque demand) is \ncalculated based on the amount of membership the input \nsignals (observed load torque and slip) have in the fuzzy \nsets. Therefore, it is required that the system inputs go \nthrough three major transformations before becoming a \nsystem output. Figure 5 shows the overall fuzzy logic based \ntraction control scheme.  In this figure, the torque demand is \ncompared with the load torque of the induction machine \n(equation 3), which is analogous to the road surface \nadhesion coefficient (\u00b5).  The induction machine, which is \npart of the plant model, runs as a generator, driven by a \npermanent magnet machine (motor).  The output of the \nplant is the wheel speed (induction machine rotor speed \n0-7803-7467-3\/02\/$17.00 \u00a92002 IEEE. 1492\ncalibrated to wheel speed), and the wheel slip (induction \nmachine slip calibrated to the wheel slip). Both of these \noutput parameters are inputs to the discrete time state \nobserver, where the \u00b5 is calculated.  The rate of change of \u00b5  \nand rate of change of slip undergo the fuzzy logic control \nscheme, which includes the transformation process of \nfuzzification, fuzzy rule reasoning and de-fuzzification. \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Fuzzy Logic based traction control scheme \n \nV. RESULTS \nAn example of the simulated performance of the fuzzy \ncontrol scheme, using an induction generator the slip \nstabilizes at 0.25 as shown in Figure 6, for a vehicle \ntraveling on a dry road surface ( 60V phase voltage). \nHowever in \u0091\u2018bang-bang\u0092\u2019 slip control where the \u0091\u2018worst case\u0092\u2019 \nslip is  limited to 0.1p.u. (due to the imposed limit)for dry \nsurfaces [9].  It can be seen that the fuzzy scheme \nautomatically adapts the slip control algorithm and \nidentifies the unstable region of the torque-slip curve (-0.35 \nto -1.0).  Eventually the slip stabilized at \u0096\u20130.25 p.u. which is \nsimilar to the \u00b5- slip characteristic of a dry road surface \n(where the peak slip is between 0.25 and  0.35 p.u.). \n \n \n \nFigure 6. Simulation results for road conditions with Fuzzy Logic Control \n \nLet\u0092\u2019s consider icy road surface, where the fuzzy control \nsystem is shown to be unstable.  This condition is simulated \nat lower induction motor phase voltage (35V), and at \u0096\u20130.1 \np.u. slip, Figure 7 shows that the system becomes unstable. \n \n \n \nFigure 7. Simulation results for road conditions without fine \u0091\u2018tuning\u0092\u2019 of \nfuzzy controller. \n \nFuzzy control with some \"tuning\" of the input and output \nmembership functions, can provide a more robust system \nunder icy condition.  The controller thereby being optimised \nfor lower values of adhesion. \n \nThe fuzzy controller was tuned in order to assure optimum \ncontrol for a vehicle traveling on icy surfaces.   As \nmentioned in section III (Figure 3 and 4) the induction \nmachine was supplied with 33V ac, to represent the icy road \nsurface. Fig 8a, shows experimental drive train shaft torque \nof 12Nm, was provided by the PM brushless machine.  \nResults shown in Fig 8b demonstrate the fuzzy controller\u0092\u2019s \nrobustness is sufficient to keep the induction machine from \noperating in the unstable torque-slip region, especially at \nlow values of adhesion (which is induction machine torque).  \nIt was noted that the measured load torque (Fig 8c) was \nderived from the measured phase current, using the \nfollowing relationship: T\u221d kI, where the constant k is equal \nto 0.23Nm\/A.  Finally, Fig 8d illustrates the observed load \nderived from a discrete time based-observer [10], has \nsimilar dynamic response as the measured load torque \n(Figure 8c). \n \n0-7803-7467-3\/02\/$17.00 \u00a92002 IEEE. 1493\n \nFig 8a.

Simulation and measured results at 33V phase voltage, which is \nanalogous to an icy surface of 0.2 \u00b5. \n \nFrom the measured data, it can be seen that the \nincorporation of the fuzzy-based discrete-time observation \ntechnique allows the dynamic \u00b5-\u03c3 characteristics to be \nobtained without a-priori knowledge of \u0091\u2018\u00b5max\u0092\u2019 (Figure 2). \n \nVI. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper a low-cost experimental test bench to facilitate \nthe evaluation for ABS\/ traction control (TC\/ABS) \nalgorithms, for application on-board electrically powered \nvehicles, was developed.  It was shown that employing an \ninduction motor as a load for the drive-train enabled various \ntire\/road \u00b5-slip characteristics could be simulated, thereby \nenabling rapid algorithm development with minimal time \nand cost.  The feasibility of using a fuzzy technique for real \ntime steady state control of vehicles was investigated.  It \nwas found that the fuzzy controller is capable of \ncompensating for nonlinearities as compared to \u0091\u2018bang-bang\u0092\u2019 \nlimited control.  The robustness of the fuzzy controller is \nimpressive.  The results have indicated that Fuzzy Logic \nbased ABS \/ traction control could substantially improve \nsteady state longitudinal performance and offer a potential \nfor optimal control of driven wheels, under icy road \nconditions. \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nThe authors would like to acknowledge the UK Engineering \nand Physical Sciences Research Council for providing \nresearch studentship to Ms.Khatun. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] Howell, S., \u0091\u2018Traction Control for an Electric Vehicle\u0092\u2019, Final Year \nMEng Project, Dept. of EEE, University of Sheffield, 2000. \n[2] Harned,J.L., Johnstine, L.E., Scharpf,G., \u0091\u2018Measurement of tire \nbrake force characteristic as related to a wheelslip (antilock) \ncontrol system\u0092\u2019, SAE Trans,vol 78, No. 69214, 1969. \n[3] Ray,L.R., \u0091\u2018Non linear system and tire force estimation for \nadvanced vehicle control\u0092\u2019, IEEE Trans on Control Systems \nTechnology, vol 3, No.1, 1995. \n[4] Klien,R., \u0091\u2018Antilock Braking System and Vehicle speed estimation \nusing Fuzzy Logic\u0092\u2019, FuzzyTECH Application paper, \nhttp:\/\/www.fuzzytech.com\/, 1999. \n[5] Constantin V.A., \u0091\u2018Fuzzy Logic in Automotive Engineering\u0092\u2019, \nEmbedded Systems Conference, 1996. \n[6] Robinson, B.J., \u0091\u2018A study of various car antilock braking system\u0092\u2019, \nResearch Report 340, Department of Transport and Road Research \nLaboratory, UK, 1991. \n[7] Mellor,P.H., Scofield,N., Hor,P.J., \u0091\u2018Brushless permanent magnet \ndrives for all-electric racing karts\u0092\u2019, Proc.29th Int.
