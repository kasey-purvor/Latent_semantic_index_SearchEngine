The malX\npromoter is repressed by MalI binding to a DNA site located from position \u0002 24 to\nposition \u0002 9, upstream of the malX promoter transcript start. The malI promoter\nis repressed byMalI binding from position13 to position118, downstream of the\nmalI transcript start. MalI binding at the malI promoter target is not required for\nrepression of the malX promoter. Similarly, MalI binding at the malX promoter\ntarget is not required for repression of the malI. Although the malX and malI\npromoters are regulated by a single DNA site for cyclic AMP receptor protein, they\nfunction independently and each is repressed by MalI binding to a different\nindependent operator site.\nIntroduction\nThe Escherichia coli malX and malY genes encode proteins\nfor the transport and metabolism of an as yet unidentified\nsubstrate (Zdych et al., 1995; Clausen et al., 2000). They are\ncotranscribed from a single promoter (the malX promoter)\nwhose activity is completely dependent on binding of the\ncyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) to a single target centred\nat position \u0002 41.5, i.e. between base pairs \u0002 41 and \u0002 42,\nupstream from the malXY transcript start (Reidl & Boos,\n1991; Lloyd et al., 2008). Upstream of malX, the divergent\nmalI gene encodes a transcription repressor that represses\nmalXYexpression (Reidl et al., 1989). Expression of themalI\ngene is dependent on a single promoter that controls\ndivergent transcription initiation from a location that is 85\nbase pairs upstream from the malX promoter transcription\nstartpoint (Lloyd et al., 2008). The malI promoter is factor-\nindependent, but can be activated \u00031.6-fold by CRP bind-\ning to its target at the malX promoter, which is centred at\nposition \u0002 43.5 with respect to the malI promoter tran-\nscription startpoint (Fig. 1).\nSequence analysis shows that MalI is a typical member of\nthe LacI family of transcription repressors (Reidl et al., 1989;\nWeickert & Adhya, 1992). Most members of this family\nfunction as dimers that bind to inverted repeats, and Reidl\net al. (1989) identified the sequence 50-GATAAAACGTTT\nTATC-30 as a likely target for MalI-dependent repression of\nthe malX promoter. In this work, we describe a genetic\nscreen to prove that this sequence, located from position\n\u0002 24 to position \u0002 9 at themalX promoter, and overlapping\nthe \u0002 10 hexamer element, is indeed the binding target for\nMalI. The malX-malI regulatory region contains a closely\nrelated sequence, 50-GGTAAAACGTTTTATC-30, from posi-\ntion 13 to position 118, downstream of the transcription\nstart of the malI promoter. We describe a similar genetic\nscreen to prove that this is the target for MalI-dependent\nautoregulation of the malI promoter.\nMaterials and methods\nThe starting materials for this work were the EcoRI\u2013HindIII\nmalX100 and malI100 fragments described by Lloyd et al.\n(2008). These fragments were inserted into the polylinker of\nthe low copy number lac expression vector plasmid, pRW50,\nencoding resistance to tetracycline (Lodge et al., 1992).\nRecombinant pRW50 derivatives were propagated in the\nDlac E. coli K-12 strain, M182, or its Dcrp derivative, as in\nHollands et al. (2007). Inserts in pRW50 were manipulated\nFEMS Microbiol Lett 305 (2010) 28\u201334c\u0004 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies\nPublished by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

(2008). The shorter malX400 fragment was\ngenerated from malX100 by PCR using primer D10527\ntogether with D62262 (50-GACGAATTCCGTTGCGTA\nATGTG-30). Likewise, the shorter malI375 fragment was\ngenerated from malI100 by PCR using primer D10527\ntogether with D65378 (50-GGAATTCCAAATTTTAGTGA\nGGCATAAATCAC-30). DNA sequences are numbered with\nthe respective transcription start sites labelled as 11 and\nupstream and downstream sequences are assigned negative\nand positive coordinates, respectively.\nPlasmid pACYC184 was used as a vector for cloning of the\nmalI gene, together with the control empty derivative\npACYC-DHN (Mitchell et al., 2007). The malI gene, to-\ngether with its promoter and flanking sequences, was\namplified by PCR using genomic DNA from E. coli K-12\nstrain MG1655 as a template and primers D63433 (50-CGA\nTAAGCTTCAAAACGTTTTATCAAATTTTAGTG-30) and\nD63434 (50-TGGTGCATGCGCAGATAAAGAGAGGATTAT\nTTCGC-30). The product was restricted with HindIII and\nSphI and cloned into plasmid pACYC184 to generate\nplasmid pACYC-malI, which encodes malI and resistance\nto chloramphenicol.\nError-prone PCR, using the flanking D10520 and D10527\nprimers and Taq DNA polymerase, was used to generate\nlibraries of random mutations in the malX400 or malI375\npromoter fragments, with the respective fragments cloned in\npRW50 as the starting templates, using the conditions\ndescribed by Barne et al. (1997). For each promoter, the\nproducts of four PCR reactions were restricted with EcoRI\nand HindIII, purified separately, and cloned into pRW50.\nAfter transformation into E. coli strain M182 carrying\npACYC-malI, colonies carrying recombinants were screened\non MacConkey lactose indicator plates containing\n35 mgmL\u00021 tetracycline and 25 mgmL\u00021 chloramphenicol.\nLac1 candidates were selected and purified, and for each\ncandidate, the entire EcoRI\u2013HindIII insert was sequenced.\nMutations are denoted by their location with respect to the\ncorresponding transcript start and the substituted base on\nthe coding nontemplate strand. Activities of different malX\nand malI promoters cloned in pRW50 were deduced from\nmeasurements of b-galactosidase expression in M182 or its\nDcrp derivative, carrying plasmid pACYC-malI or the con-\ntrol empty pACYC-DHN plasmid.\nResults and discussion\nIdentification of the functional MalI-binding\ntarget at the malX promoter\nFigure 1 shows a diagram illustrating the malX-malI inter-\ngenic region with the transcription start sites for the malX\nand malI promoters, the corresponding \u0002 10 elements, and\nthe DNA site for CRP that is located at position \u0002 41.5 with\nrespect to the malX transcription start and position \u0002 43.5\nwith respect to the malI transcription start. Figure 1 also\nshows the locations of two 16 base pair elements, suggested\nto be the operator targets for the MalI repressor. The aim of\nthe work described here was to investigate this suggestion\nand to determine the functional operator(s) for each pro-\nmoter.\nIn a previous work, Lloyd et al. (2008) described how the\nmalX promoter could be assayed by cloning the malX100\nfragment into the lac expression vector plasmid, pRW50.\nMeasurements of b-galactosidase expression in M182 or its\nDcrp derivative showed the malX promoter to be a typical\nClass II CRP-dependent promoter, which is consistent with\nthe location of the DNA site for CRP (West et al., 1993).\nLloyd et al. (2008) also reported that expression of the malX\npromoter<lac fusion carried by pRW50 is unaffected by the\nintroduction of a multicopy plasmid carrying the malX-\nmalI intergenic region, suggesting that the level of chromo-\nsomally encoded MalI is insufficient to repress the malX\npromoter significantly.

Measurements of b-galactosidase expression\nin M182 cells carrying pRW50 with the malX100 promoter\nshow that the presence of pACYC-malI causes an \u000330-fold\nreduction in expression, compared with the control with the\nempty pACYC-DHN plasmid (Table 1, upper panel). The\nexperiment was then repeated with M182 cells carrying\npRW50 with the malX400 promoter fragment, in which the\nmalX promoter sequence upstream of the DNA site for CRP\nhad been removed (illustrated in Fig. 1). The data in Table 1\n(upper panel) show that neither malX promoter activity nor\nrepression by MalI is substantially affected by the deletion,\nand thus sequences upstream of the DNA site for CRP must\nplay little or no role.\nOn MacConkey lactose indicator plates, colonies of M182\ncarrying pRW50 with either the malX100 or malX400\npromoter fragments, together with pACYC-malI, appear as\nwhite Lac\u0002 colonies. In contrast, if pACYC-malI is replaced\nwith pACYC-DHN, colonies have a bright red, clear Lac1\nappearance. Thus, to pinpoint the operator sequences\nessential for repression of the malX promoter by MalI, we\nused error-prone PCR to generate a library of random\nmutations in the malX400 promoter fragment and screened\nfor mutations that resulted in pink or red colonies of cells\ncontaining pACYC-malI.

After screening\nover 2500 colonies, we identified eight different single-base\nchanges that are shown in Fig. 2. Strikingly, all these\nsubstitutions fall in the 16 base pair sequence from position\n\u0002 24 to position \u0002 9 that had been suggested to be a target\nfor MalI (Reidl et al., 1989). Our result argues strongly that\nthis sequence alone is necessary for MalI-dependent repres-\nsion. The upper panel of Table 1 lists the effects of the\ndifferent point mutations on malX promoter activity and\nMalI-dependent repression. Different mutations reduce\nrepression from \u000330-fold to 1.7- to 3.9-fold. Interestingly,\nmany of the base changes up- or downregulate the activity of\nthemalX promoter in the absence of MalI. This is consistent\nwith their location upstream of the \u0002 10 hexamer element\n(Fig. 2). Recall that many E. coli promoters carry weakly\nconserved promoter elements in this region that contribute\nto the overall promoter activity (Mitchell et al., 2003).\nIdentification of the functional MalI-binding\ntarget at the malI promoter\nMeasurements of b-galactosidase expression in M182 cells\ncarrying pRW50 with the malI100 promoter show that the\npresence of pACYC-malI causes a sharp reduction in expres-\nsion, compared with the control with the empty pACYC-\nDHN plasmid (Table 1, middle panel). To check whether the\nDNA site for MalI at the malX promoter plays any role in\nthis repression, the experiment was repeated with pRW50\ncarrying the malI375 promoter fragment, in which the malI\npromoter sequence upstream of the DNA site for CRP had\nbeen removed (illustrated in Fig. 1). The data in Table 1\nshow that the absence of the DNA site for MalI at the malX\npromoter does not compromise MalI-dependent repression\nof the malI promoter. However, malI promoter activity in\nthe shortermalI375 fragment is reduced by\u000325% compared\nwith the malI100 fragment. This was expected as we\nreported previously that upstream sequences are essential\nfor optimal expression from themalI promoter (Lloyd et al.,\n2008).\nOnMacConkey lactose indicator plates, colonies of M182\ncarrying pRW50 with either the malI100 or the malI375\npromoter fragments together with pACYC-malI appear as\nwhite Lac\u0002 colonies. In contrast, if pACYC-malI is replaced\nwith pACYC-DHN, colonies have a bright red clear Lac1\nappearance.

Different mutations reduce\nrepression from \u000317.5-fold to 1.7- to 8.5-fold. Strikingly,\nwith the control pACYC-DHN plasmid, the 15C, 18G,\n19G, 111A, 112C, 113C, and 116T mutations all\ncause small increases in b-galactosidase expression,\nwhile the \u0002 49T mutation causes a fourfold increase. The\nsimplest explanation for these observations is that the\n\u0002 49Tmutation considerably increases the intrinsic activity\nof the malI promoter, and that the reduction in MalI-\ndependent repression is a secondary consequence of the\npromoter being substantially stronger. In contrast, we\nsuggest that the primary effect of the other seven substitu-\ntions is to interfere with MalI-dependent repression of the\nmalI promoter, but that these changes also produce second-\nary effects, possibly by altering the structure at the 50 end of\nthe malI transcript.\nThe lower panel of Table 1 shows the results of an\nexperiment to measure MalI-dependent repression of the\nmalI promoter in a Dcrp background and the effects of the\ndifferent mutations. Recall that, unlike the malX promoter,\nthe malI promoter is active in the absence of CRP (Lloyd\net al., 2008). The results show that MalI-dependent repres-\nsion is slightly greater in the absence of CRP, but each of the\ndifferent mutations has a similar effect.\nConclusions\nMembers of the LacI\u2013GalR family of transcriptional repres-\nsors are usually functional as dimers, although in some\ncases, repression depends on the dimerization of dimers or\ninteractions with other proteins, such as CRP (Weickert &\nAdhya, 1992; Valentin-Hansen et al., 1996). Such repressors\nbind to inverted repeats at target sites and binding is\nmodulated by a ligand (Weickert & Adhya, 1992; Swint-\nKruse & Matthews, 2009). In the case of MalI, the ligand is\nunknown, but it is assumed that it must be related to the\nfunction of MalX and MalY, which, to date, is unknown.\nReidl et al. (1989), who first discovered the malI gene, and\nthe divergent malXY operon, identified two 16 base pair\nsequences, each containing an inverted repeat, that were\nboth suggested to be targets for dimeric MalI. The aim of\nthis work was to investigate these sequences and to deter-\nmine if repression of themalXYandmalI transcription units\nrequired one or both targets. In preliminary work, we\nattempted a biochemical approach, but we were unable to\noverexpress soluble functional MalI protein (G.S. Lloyd,\nunpublished data). Hence, we turned to a genetic approach\nby setting up an E. coli strain where MalI-dependent repres-\nsion of the malX or malI promoter yielded a clear pheno-\ntype, which was then used to screen for mutations that\ninterfere with repression. Our results with the malX promo-\nter unambiguously identify the 16 base pair target from\nmalX sequences\nK12 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTACTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nO157 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTACTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nAPEC AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTATTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nW3110 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTACTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nUTI89 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTATTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nCFT073 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTATTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\n301 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTACTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nSb227 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTACTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\n8401 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTACTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nSd197 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTACTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nSs046 AAATTTGATAAAACGTTTTATCTTCTCGCGCAATTTACTGAATCCAGATTGTTCTCTACGAGGAGTCGTTTTATGACGGCG\nmalI sequences\nK12  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\n0157  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACAAAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\nAPEC  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\nW3110  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\nUTI89  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\nCFT073  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\n301  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\nSb227   TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\n8401  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\nSd197  TATAAGATAAATAAAAGGTAAAACGTTTTATCTGTCACATAATCAGGGAGTAGGTCATCTGCATGGCTACC\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 3.

Lloyd et al.\nposition \u0002 24 to position \u0002 9 as the target for MalI binding\nand show that the second 16 base pair element, which is\nlocated upstream (Fig. 1), plays little or no role. In contrast,\nthis second element, which is located from position 13 to\nposition 118, downstream of the malI transcript start,\nappears to be the key target for MalI-dependent repression of\nthe malI promoter, and the MalI operator site at the malX\npromoter plays little or no role. This repression appears to be\nindependent of CRP. Indeed, repression in the absence of CRP\nappears to be slightly stronger than in its presence (Table 1).\nThe divergentmalX andmalI promoters share a common\nDNA site for CRP. As for other divergent bacterial promo-\nters that share an activator-binding site, activation in one\ndirection is largely independent of activation in the opposite\ndirection and this is likely to be due to the low frequency of\ninitiation at most promoters (El-Robh & Busby, 2002).\nAlthough the malX and malI promoters share a DNA site\nfor CRP, each has a separate and independent DNA site for\nMalI. ThemalX promoter MalI operator is located upstream\nof the transcript start and overlaps the upstream end of the\n\u0002 10 hexamer, while the malI promoter MalI operator is\nlocated downstream of the transcript start. This organiza-\ntion is well conserved in the genomes of different strains of\nE. coli and related Shigella. Figure 3 shows a comparison of\nthe base sequences upstream of the malX and malI transla-\ntion start sites in these genomes, and the comparison\nemphasizes how the precise locations of \u0002 10 elements and\nMalI operator sequences have been maintained. This pro-\nvides yet another example of how efficient repression can\nresult from a repressor interacting at different locations at a\nbacterial promoter (Rojo, 2001; Barnard et al., 2004).\nInterestingly, repression is marginally greater at the malX\npromoter than at the malI promoter, and this is consistent\nwith MalI action at themalI promoter being autoregulatory.\nThe E. coli K-12 malX-malI intergenic regulatory region\nprovides a simple example of \u2018evolution and tinkering\u2019\n(Jacob, 1977). The malX promoter is an unremarkable\nCRP-dependent promoter that resembles scores of Class II\npromoters (Busby & Ebright, 1999) and it can be shut off by\nMalI. In contrast, although the divergent malI promoter\nresembles a Class II CRP-dependent promoter, it has\nadapted to ensure that the MalI repressor is always made.\nThus, MalI-dependent repression is marginally less efficient\ncompared with themalX promoter, the dependence on CRP\nis relaxed by the DNA site for CRP being located at position\n\u0002 43.5, and the promoter carries seven repeats of a 50-TAN8-30\nmotif, to facilitate RNA polymerase recruitment (Lloyd\net al., 2008).\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was funded by a Wellcome Trust program grant.\nWe thank undergraduate project students, Clare Mensley,\nJames Fuller, and Maria Jesus Pina, for some of the\nconstructions.\nReferences\nBarnard A, Wolfe A & Busby SJ (2004) Regulation at complex\nbacterial promoters: how bacteria use different promoter\norganisations to produce different regulatory outcomes.
