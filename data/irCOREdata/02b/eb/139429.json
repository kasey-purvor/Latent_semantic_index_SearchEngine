One of the key advantages (Miller, 1990, Pascale, 1990,\nStacey et al., 2000, Tushman and O\u2019Reilly, 1996), but still a challenge for these organisa-\ntional concepts, lies in orchestrating a variety of contradictory demands, from a high un-\ncertainty to a high structural complexity.\nProjects tend to emerge as chaotic systems, in the sense of formless or disordered (OED,\n2007) with a unique idea, undefined scope, unclear division of authority and responsibili-\nties, etc. The following phases clearly demand higher levels of order. For example, in\nconstruction and engineering projects, procurement, production and assembly involve\nmany companies and people; consequently clear scope, division of work and decentrali-\nsation of authority and responsibility are necessary to cope with the amount of work to be\ndone on time (Geraldi and Adlbrecht, 2007). These differences have been stressed in sev-\neral studies, such as (McCray et al., 2002, Lundin and S\u00f6derholm, 1995, Morris and\nHough, 1987).\nThus, the management of projects faces different challenges and requires organisational\nstructures with different degrees of flexibility \u2212 both mechanistic and organic, both or-\ndered and chaotic. This paradox is especially pronounced in multi-project companies \u2013\ncompanies that have projects as their main source of turnover, such as software develop-\nment, engineering, consulting, and civil engineering. In these companies, this diversity is\nnot only present between project phases, but also between projects in the company\u2019s port-\nfolio, between the functions related to projects and supporting functions, between facili-\nties, between relevant project partners, between different clients, etc.\nIn order to cope with this heterogeneity, multi-project firms should reconcile order and\nchaos in their organisational structures. However, studies suggest that multi-project firms\nare experiencing difficulties in staying at this position. The wish to avoid inefficiency and\nto overcome uncertainty exacerbates the pressure for higher levels of control and bu-\nreaucratises the project work (Hodgson, 2004, Raisanen and Linde, 2004, Styhre, 2006).\nOver 70% of project managers complain about the bureaucracy of project processes\n(Crawford et al., 2005). This changes the function of project managers from that of a\nmanager of creativity, change and risk to a manager of paper and forms \u2013 from an organic\norganisational solution to a bureaucratic reality. However, other studies claim the oppo-\nsite: companies have an ad hoc approach to the management of projects (KPMG, 2002-\n2003, NAO, 2005). These conflicting findings point to the necessity of further studies.\nCurrent management and organisational models, such as Ambidextrous Organisation,\nsuggest that successful organisations are those able to combine classical organisational\ntrade-offs, such as differentiation and low-cost strategies (Porter, 1980), global integra-\ntion and local responsiveness (Bartlett, 1989), incremental and radical innovation\n(O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004, Brookes et al, 2006), mechanistic and organic orientations\n(Duncan, 1976) or bureaucracy and adhocracy (Mintzberg, 1983), differentiation and in-\ntegration (Lawrence and Scanlan, 2007), flexibility and efficiency (Adler et al., 1999,\nThompson, 1967), function and project-oriented organisation (Geraldi et al 2008,\nGalbraith, 1973), among many others. Current study published in Harvard Business Re-\n3view (Takeuchi et al., 2008) and the overview of the subject published in the Journal of\nManagement (Raisch and Birkinshaw, 2008) this year enforces the relevance and timeli-\nness of the topic.\nIn the project management field, the existence and necessity of semi-structures was firstly\nidentified and analysed by Brown and Eisenhardt (1997) in their studies of the organisa-\ntion of R&D projects. However, the coexistence was not widely explored, solutions for\nthe problem are still not available, and studies on Multi-Project Firms are still lacking.\nThis study contributes to filling this gap.\nThe goal of the study was to understand how multi-project companies balance order and\nchaos present in their organisation and the consequences of this position for the strategic\norientation of these firms in the long term, as well as the role(s) these companies may un-\ndertake in the value chain.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe multi-project companies and their organisation were the research object of this study.\nI studied one archetypical type of multi-project company in depth \u2013 CoPS (Complex\nProducts and Systems) producers, which are large, traditional, mainly based in German\ncompanies, undertaking complex engineering and construction projects.\nGrounded on the juxtaposition of strategies proposed by (Ford et al., 1983) and (Marti-\nnez-Miguelez, 1994), the study commenced with an Exploratory Phase comprising a lit-\nerature review and 12 in-depth interviews with people in different departments of a large\nCoPS producer (Company A) This combination guaranteed that the questions generated\nwere not only in line with the demands of practice, but also contributed to a research gap\nin the literature.\nThe Conceptual Model was abductively designed based on a field study (three months\nobserving Company A) and a longitudinal study during the next one year and four\nmonths in the same company \u2013 the Conceptualisation Phase. These methods were used\nbecause they provide in-depth understanding of company structures, processes, mecha-\nnisms, conditions, relationships and development (Eisenhardt, 1989). It also avoided the\ninflexibility of normal science (Kuhn, 1970) and kept this investigation as close to reality\nas possible. The method also has particular value in applied research for generating prac-\ntical tools and improvements (Karvinen and Bennett, 2006). This is relevant for project\nmanagement, as this research area is very practice-oriented (Blomqiust et al., 2006,\nTurner, 2006). Finally, it allows a cross-disciplinary approach to the research question,\nwhich is appropriate, as management is deemed to be eclectic (Easterby-Smith et al.,\n1999).\nThis Conceptual Model was subsequently deductively validated through a multi-case\nstudy conducted with seven multi-project firms. I have purposefully chosen these compa-\nnies so that the sample embraced CoPS producers with different characteristics and fo-\ncuses, as suggested by Eisenhardt (1989). This phase includes interviews with people in\ndifferent departments, observations and secondary sources.\n4This combination of conceptualisation and validation through qualitative research is\nrather unusual, as the likelihood of validation of Phase 2 is high, because the process is so\nclose to reality (Eisenhardt, 1989), and consequently a second validation would be redun-\ndant. However, as the first phase was based on observations of one company, the author\nconsidered it necessary to return to the reality after the \u201ccomplete\u201d elaboration of the\nConceptual Model, and to test its validity for other companies and in a more structured\nform, establishing values for the various parameters defined in the previous phase.\nMODEL\nBased on the contingency premises (Donaldson, 2001), it can be argued that as projects\ndeal with several contexts or challenges, they require organisational units with different\norganisational designs (Turner and M\u00fcller, 2006, Keegan and Turner, 2002, Morris and\nHough, 1987, Engwall, 2003, Karlsen and Lereim, 2005). This research analyses the or-\nganisational response (order and chaos measured by flexibility of the companies) to pro-\nject challenges (assessed by the complexity of the project and its context).\nThe Conceptual Model is composed of four parts. The first part assesses heterogeneity of\norganisational units (departments, types of projects, facilities, companies in macro or-\nganisation, etc) present in projects and multi-project companies based on the complexities\nfaced by the project portfolio and the flexibility of the organisational structures used to\nmanage these complexities.\nThe complexity was defined by complexity of faith (commercial and technological\nuniqueness and commercial and technological immaturity of projects) and complexity of\nfact (size, budget, number of contacts and impact of changes). This was based on a well-\nknown and widely accepted distinction between structural complexity and uncertainty (or\nrandomness) (Macheridis and Nilsson, 2004, Williams, 2002).\nFlexibility has been widely discussed in the literature on manufacturing (Slack, 1987,\nNilsson and Nordahl, 1995) and on strategy (Danneels, 2002, Teece et al., 1997). Despite\nthe relevance of flexibility in projects and multi-project firms (Morris and Hough, 1987),\nthere are relatively few studies on flexibility dedicated to this field. Olsson (Olsson,\n2006) defines flexibility in projects according to the flexibility of the product and the\nprocess, that is, what to do and how to do it. Flexibility is defined by the range of possi-\nbilities that the organisation allows one to choose with regard to what, how, who, when,\nhow much and where in projects.\nThe framework resulting from the juxtaposition of these variables (Part II) comprises four\norganisational archetypes: the creative-reflective, mechanic-structured, \u2018chaotification of\norder\u2019 and \u2018bureaucratisation of chaos\u2019 (see Figure 1). Companies managing to place\ntheir organisational units in different positions in the lighter area of the figure are those at\nthe edge of chaos, as the companies manage the tension between bureaucracy and chaos\nwhen facing many challenges.\n5Figure 1: Fit between Complexity and Flexibility\nThe third part explores the dynamic of organisational units, i.e. how these change posi-\ntions in this framework by opening and closing, separating and merging, moving, ex-\npanding and contracting the area occupied, and creating factitious positions in different\nplaces on the framework. Apart from these movements, the part also suggests the exis-\ntence of three patterns: isomorphism, misfits leading to misfits and dynamics of the\nframework per se (new challenges arrive expanding the framework towards higher de-\ngrees of complexity of faith and flexibility, but current challenges are transformed into\ncomplexity of fact and managed through lower flexibilities).\nThe last part relates to the link between the previous parts and the core competence of the\norganisation. Three types of core competences were defined: core competence on reliabil-\nity (\u201cwe focus on reliability\u201d) on technological innovation (\u201cwe create your future\u201d), and\non interaction (\u201cwe make your ideas come true\u201d).\nCONTEXT OF THE THESIS\nThis research was undertaken in the project management group (Management interna-\ntionale Projekte, MIP) in the mechanical engineering department in the University of\nSiegen, Germany.\nA doctorate in Germany is idiosyncratic and therefore it is difficult to approach in general\nterms; different people and different supervisors would organise it in different ways. I\nwill focus on my experience. A good source of general information about doctoral studies\nin Germany is the DAAD (German research council, see\nhttp:\/\/www.daad.de\/deutschland\/studienangebote\/promotion\/06546.en.html). There are\nmainly two non-exclusive types of doctorate in Germany: through a doctorate programme\nand while working as \u201cwissenschaftler Mitarbeiter\u201d.\nA. Creative-\nReflective\nB.

My tasks as \u201cwissenschaftler Mitarbeiter\u201d were similar to those of a\nlecturer in the UK Universities: I gave lectures, supervised several Studienarbeiten\n(equivalent to Bachelors Thesis) and Diplomarbeiten (equivalent to Masters Thesis), or-\nganised and participated in conferences and workshops events, created and managed co-\noperation with other universities and companies, executed other studies mainly within my\nresearch interests and adjacent to the thesis topic itself, etc.\nUnlike other countries, I was not enrolled in a structured doctorate programme, and so\nthere are no methodology courses or fixed stage-gates such as a yearly review of the the-\nsis. However, the system also provides the flexibility to search for the courses, workshop\nand conferences. It takes some time to understand this flexibility and be able to use it, but\nas soon as I did, I took advantage of it and enrolled in methodology courses and PhD\nworkshops in different universities as well as participating in several conferences.\nI was working with a group that had a very strong relationship with mechanical engineer-\ning firms, especially because almost all Diplomarbeiten (Masters thesis) were undertaken\nin companies focused on the solution of a practical problem but from an academic per-\nspective. Consequently, I was confronted with different problems in projects and project-\nbased companies in different industries and contexts and had the opportunity to discuss\nthose issues in depth with practitioners. We were also a very international group, and had\ncontacts with companies in all continents. This strong link with the practice was useful to\nunderstand and reflect on company\u2019s problems and feasibility of solutions proposed in\nthe academy; it also provided me with good access to empirical data that enabled the\nmethodology used in this study in the first place.\nLooking back, it became clear to me that the journey followed similar patterns than those\nI was exploring in multi-project firms. In moments dominated by \u2018complexity of faith\u2019, I\ndefined what I would be doing (my research topic and question), how I would like to do\n(methodology), my timeframe, etc; in moments of \u2018complexity of fact\u2019, the plan was de-\ntailed, defining what I need to and actually doing it.\nIn some of these moments, I felt myself in \u2018chaotification of order\u2019, when I indeed had\ntoo much freedom. These moments made me grow, and construct my own \u201cinflexibili-\nties\u201d and even more challenging, to obey them. \u2018Bureaucratisation of chaos\u2019 was also part\nof my journey, when I had to follow very systematic methods to unfold concepts that\nwere still unclear. I am very thankful to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. G. Adlbrecht, for giving\nme guidance, but still the possibility to navigate between order and chaos during this\nprocess.\nOne of the key processes at the end of the journey was to reduce complexity of faith and\nfact, simplify the findings and identify the contributions of my study. These are briefly\ndiscussed in the next section.\nFINDINGS\nIn general, the Conceptual Model supports companies to orchestrate this heterogeneity by\nmaking sense (qualitatively) and assessing (quantitatively) their current ability to manage\n7the tensions between order and chaos. Specifically, I would like to draw attention to key\ncontributions of the research.\nThe empirical data confirmed that multi-project firms have and demand both order and\nchaos. Order and chaos coexisted among and within project phases, projects, depart-\nments. They were also present in project context \u2013 in client, governmental institutions,\nbanks, etc.\nHowever, companies tend to avoid the coexistence of order and chaos. A high degree of\none parameter of complexity is compensated for with a lower degree of another. This\navoided excessive risk. Similarly, flexibility bottlenecks were not observed as expected in\nthe theory, but rather different patterns of flexibility in which the values of the parameters\nwere heterogeneous. There was also a limited overlapping of complexity of faith and fact\nin the course of a project.\nThis raises the question of how to reduce complexity of faith and enhance fact along the\nproject life cycle. The Conceptual Model points out that project managers should not only\nnot only consider the speed in which one should move from creative-reflective to me-\nchanic-structured environment (see Figure 1) but also on the trajectory along which the\nproject moves in the framework, avoiding the wish to reduce uncertainty by reducing the\nflexibility of project organisation leading projects towards bureaucratisation of chaos, but\nalso avoiding the excessive flexibility leading to re-work and unnecessary \u201cchaos\u201d.\nAnother interesting finding was the compensation between the flexibility constrained by\nthe company and by the external stakeholders. Two strategies were identified:\no Type A: Company needs flexible structures in order to adapt to the inflexible\nwishes of the stakeholders\no Type B: Companies build internal inflexibilities to compensate for external\n\u2018chaos\u2019 (Key Finding 4)\nThe multi-project firms studied usually featured a flexible organisation. This flexibility\nwas used to adapt to client\u2019s inflexibility, i.e. a set of different constraints desired by each\nclient, such as local content, procedures and reporting, documentation, standards, etc.\nThus, multi-project company tends not to develop a unified process and product range, as\nthese are customised to each client. Thus, successful companies create \u2018chaotic struc-\ntures\u2019 to compensate for \u2018ordered\u2019 external demands. This partly explains the tension be-\ntween the rhetoric of an organic organisation and a bureaucratised reality.\nCompanies in \u2018chaotic\u2019 environments, which deal with high complexity of faith and exe-\ncute projects with rather intangible outputs tend to create their own \u2018order\u2019 (Company A).\nAs internal inflexibilities tended to be less respected than external, type B strategies were\nmore likely to succeed if the internal order is accepted as an \u2018Act of God\u2019.\nEven though \u2018order\u2019 is deemed as fundamental to successful companies, the results\nshowed that bureaucratisation of chaos (excess of order) is more harmful than chaotifi-\ncation of order (excess of chaos).\nAs companies and project managers do not decide alone their degree of fit and misfit,\nideal situations are not always possible. One solution companies and individuals found to\ndeal with non-ideal situations was the creation of what I termed \u2018factitious positions\u2019. The\n8creation of factitious positions refers to organisational units producing an image that they\nare in a different place than they in reality are, and consequently increasing the accep-\ntance of their position. This supported several common situations in business, such as in\nattending to unrealistic demands of the client, or in overcoming barriers to the execution\nof something unique and by this means keeping the dynamic of the organisation.\nFinally, more than the measurements and the contributions described above, the main\ncontribution of this work is to assist people understand the phenomena of \u2018bureaucratisa-\ntion of chaos\u2019 and \u2018chaotification of order\u2019, and to avoid these when delegating tasks,\npromoting changes in the organisational structure, negotiating conditions with clients and\nsuppliers, etc.\nCONCLUSIONS\nSummarising, this research explores the ability of traditional multi-project firms to or-\nchestrate the plurality of contradictory challenges they face; an ability necessary not only\nfor multi-project firms but also for organisations facing a world of uncertainties treated as\ncertainties, mass customisation, regional globalisation, flexible efficiency, creative reli-\nable solutions, etc, i.e. organisations facing the \u201creal world\u201d. This work provided compa-\nnies with a map to make sense of these contradictions and promote reconciliation.\nIn the analysis, I identified that companies tend to compensate rather than reconcile con-\nflicting demands. Consequently, future research questions should be related to the under-\nstanding of this phenomenon, and, as the study was constrained to one sector and mainly\none country, to the search of multi-project companies in other sectors and in other coun-\ntries are more successful in keeping the balance between order and chaos. As mentioned\nin the introduction, this issue is not only present in multi-project firms, but is deemed to\nbe a central paradox of management, and the current publications in the area of ambidex-\nterity are evidence that this is a relevant and current subject (Raisch and Birkinshaw,\n2008, Takeuchi et al., 2008). Therefore, future research would benefit from a cross-\nfertilisation of the studies on multi-project firms and other non-project oriented busi-\nnesses, as such studies are still lacking. The phenomenon could also be related to differ-\nent cultures, and consequently, future research would profit from a larger and more inter-\nnational sample would. Finally, the model was only applied to departments, it would be\nrelevant to see if similar patterns would also be identified in micro level and macro level -\nwhere the objects of analysis are people and companies, respectively.\nREFERENCES\nADLER, P.
