It has involved non-training \ndoctors from staff grades to senior consultants, including those primarily involved \nin management, CPD provision and assessment; and institutional officials, such as \nin Deaneries and universities, across a range of specialties to determine their \nunderstanding of: \n \n\u2022  their own learning, or the learning of other doctors within their \norganisations \n\u2022  how this learning relates to conceptions of CPD, its provision and its \nuptake \n\u2022  effective CPD \n \nThe research was conducted by a team comprised of clinicians and educators. The \nintention was to interview medical practitioners, educators and managers regarding \ntheir experiences from various expert points of view, supplemented by, and \ncontrasting with, data collected by a more quantitative methodological approach. \n \nThere has been little literature in terms of the evaluation of the effectiveness of \nCPD. Thus this project had as a key aim to explore this. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 6 \nExecutive Summary \nThis report explores how new consultants to senior consultants understand: \n \n\u2022  their own learning, or the learning of other doctors within their \norganisations \n\u2022  how this learning relates to conceptions of CPD, its provision and its \nuptake.  \n \nThe report contains 6 chapters. Key points follow: \n \nChapter 1: Introduction \nThis brief overview explores definitions of CPD, its nature and the somewhat \nelusive notion of effectiveness. It examines the potentially competing modalities \n(organisational and individual). \n \nChapter 2: Objectives, research design and methods \nThe main aim was to identify what promotes and what inhibits the effectiveness of \nCPD. This was explored in terms of 4 broad objectives: \n \n1.  To compare and contrast the experiences of continuing professional \ndevelopment across the range of specialties \n2.  To identify and describe the range of different models of CPD employed across \nthe different specialties and clinical contexts \n3.  To consider the educational potential of reflective practice in CPD and its \nimpact on professional practice \n4.  To explore how different professionals judge the effectiveness of current CPD \npractices \n \nThe research design was developed to address 2 fundamental needs: i) covering the \nrange of medical specialties and posts within those and ii) focusing on what \nhappened in the clinical setting. \n \nData was collected through: \n\u2022  questionnaire \n\u2022  letters to CPD leads \n\u2022  interviews  \n\u2022  shadowing \n \nChapter 3: Literature Review \nIt is considered that CPD goes beyond what doctors do and that there is \u201cno single, \nsingular or correct way of doing CPD\u201d. In organisational terms: \n\u2022  flexibility is of vital importance in the development and provision of CPD, \nas are principles of justification and transparency. Active modes of learning, \nlinking of CPD with learning needs analysis and integration of knowledge \nwith everyday practice were major contributing factors to effective CPD \n\u2022  flexibility raised issues for assessing and accrediting and for recording CPD \n\u2022  the range of providers of CPD is extensive and diverse \n\u2022  the boundary between CPD and quality assurance can be a grey area \n\u2022   \nChapter 4: Results and findings Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 7 \nKey insights from the review of the literature informed questions which were asked \nin the questionnaire, letters to CPD leads and the interviews.  \n \nQuestionnaire results: \n\u2022  highest scores for CPD experiences over the past 12 months were \nconference attendance, local events and journals \n\u2022  determinants of CPD with highest scores were interest, knowledge\/skills gap \nand reflection on practice \n\u2022  the greatest impact of CPD was \u201cagreed\u201d by the majority of respondents in \nthe following contexts: change in treatment practice; knowledge acquisition \nand learner satisfaction \n\u2022  the highest scores for attitudes towards CPD were as a natural part of \nprofessional life, necessary for patient safety and rewarding \n\u2022  to the question of who should be responsible for CPD provision, the \ncategory of Colleges and Faculties was given the highest score \n\u2022  the category of Colleges and Faculties also scored highest with regard to the \nquestion of who should be responsible for the content of CPD provision \n\u2022  the highest score for how do consultants learn best was allocated to \n\u201cexperience\u201d \n\u2022  study leave availability, cost and work-life balance scored highest as barriers \nto CPD participation \n\u2022  respondents gave College conferences, medical society conferences and \nspeciality associations the highest scores for the most valuable contributors \nto CPD. \n \nLetters to CPD Leads\/interviews: \n\u2022  guidelines\/advice given to members was various and included \nrecommendations on reflection and blended learning to details of the credit \npoint systems \n\u2022  provision of guidelines\/advice was listed as being through one of three \nmodalities: online, postal delivery or personal contact with designated \nmember(s) from the College or Faculty \n\u2022  members were described as being able to provide feedback in the following \nways: informal meetings, using Directorate of CPD and organisational \ninfrastructure \n\u2022  the range of educational opportunities provided were listed as: local and \nnational course provision, e-learning modules, seminars, workshops, \nconferences, journals and trainer training programmes \n\u2022  guiding fellows to do specific CPD topics was described in terms of \n\u201cflexibility\u201d, \u201csignposting\u201d, \u201ckite-marking\u201d and communicated online, \nthrough postal services, at meetings and through allocation of credit points \nfor specific CPD activities \n\u2022  if uptake was measured, the mechanism used was described by a variety of \nauditing procedures of annual CPD returns \n\u2022  the use of diaries (paper or online) was described as the most frequent \nmethod by which members recorded their CPD, with ePortfolios as the \nsecond most frequent method \n\u2022  methods used by the organisation to evaluate the effectiveness of CPD were \nvariously described as none to \u201can open culture encouraging feedback in \ngeneral\u201d to an audit of members\u2019 activities Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 8 \n\u2022  to the question of whether the organisation had any literature pertaining to \neffectiveness of CPD, respondents replied in the negative. \n \nChapter 5: Discussion \nThe discussion of the findings was focused around questions derived from the \nresearch objectives. \n \nDoctors\u2019 understanding of the term \u201clearning\u201d and the effect on CPD \nLearning and CPD: \n\u2022  CPD is learning and both are inextricably linked into \u201cdoing the job\u201d \n\u2022  learning has two forms: i) the addition of something new and ii) verifying \nthat practice is the same or similar enough to what everybody else is doing \n\u2022  CPD can systematise learning by deliberately providing a range of different \napproaches, variations in practice, and changes in viewpoint in order to \nenrich the experience, practice and knowledge of professionals. This can be \ndeveloped further into a more systematic, rigorous and robust tool for \nvalidity checking \n\u2022  \u201ckeeping up-to-date\u201d and \u201cconfirming practice\u201d ranged from attending \nconference, workshops, external meetings, in-house meetings, through \n\u201csharing surgical theatre sessions\u201d to interactions with colleagues \n\u2022  professionals may stay within their \u201ccomfort zones\u201d when selecting their \nCPD. Would they continue to do so if the scoring by which CPD is assessed \nwere to change? Alternatives to the scoring system need to be identified and \nexplored \n\u2022  professionals should be able to appraise and critique their own practice. \n \nCPD as learning: \n\u2022  CPD is seen as essential to effective practice and to an individual\u2019s \ndevelopment within the profession whether or not that results in career \nprogression \n\u2022  it is linked to \u201cpersonal learning needs\u201d and often associated with \nappraisals and seen as a way of  \u201cgap filling\u201d \n\u2022  the continuous-ness, of CPD was often articulated as \u201cmoving on\u201d, \n\u201ccontinuing to develop\u201d \n\u2022  the medical profession is a very heterogeneous group. CPD providers and \nassessors have to address how to formulate learning for this considerable \nvariety. \n \nDistribution of CPD across institutional and more personal (individual) settings: \n\u2022  national provision favours those who live in London and the Home Counties \nfor a number of reasons: financial, time, job demands, work-life balance \n\u2022  external events were perceived as providing a wider diversity of CPD \nlearning opportunities \n\u2022  hospitals and general practice surgeries vary from teaching to non-teaching, \nfrom large to small, from being \u201ceducationally active\u201d to being neutral or \ndisinterested  \n\u2022  \u201clearning there and then\u201d is seen to provide significant learning experiences \nbut the question remains as how to assess this rigorously and robustly.  \n \nWhat counts as CPD? Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 9 \n\u2022  being fit to practice is different to being safe to practice. This distinction \nleads to questions of whether the purpose of CPD is to raise everyone to a \nminimum standard or whether its purpose is to allow individuals to pursue \nlearning interests more generally \n\u2022  in the context of quality assurance, what is identifiable and claimable. \nHowever, networking and peer review on practice provides professionals \nwith ways of comparing the quality of their practice \n\u2022  there were some clear differences between what users of CPD considered it \nto be compared to those with some role in quality assurance. \n \nThe status of workplace learning \n\u2022  situated workplace learning outcomes are complex and resist quantification. \nThis complexity needs to be reflected in the system \n\u2022  occasions for feedback and dialogue as a basis for CPD in the workplace \ncould be developed since \u201cmost of what doctors do is talk\u201d. \n \nWhat counts as effective CPD? \n\u2022  effective CPD involves both \u201clearning\u201d and being \u201cfit to practise\u201d, \nknowing both the \u201cwhy\u201d and the \u201chow\u201d and putting learning into practice \n\u2022  effectiveness is facilitated when professionals are able to determine their \nown learning needs through reflection within the totality of their practice. \nThis means being able to go beyond what is quantifiable. \n \nCulturally embedded learning challenges: scientific and medical knowledge \nshaping conceptions and conduct of interactions \nExpressions, modes of articulation and the metaphors used by professionals provide \ninsights into the ways of seeing, thinking, doing and speaking and how these \ninterlink into developing medical concepts and of the conduct of professional \ninteractions.  \n \nHow people talked about their ways of learning shaped their strategies for learning. \nChanging the metaphors employed may change the way they think about and \nundertake learning. \n \nOrganisational perspective shaping conceptions of CPD needs \n\u2022  providers of external CPD need to i) attract large audiences, ii) offer a wide \nrange of events of high quality to attract a broad spectrum of professionals, \nand iii) ensure that the audience keeps returning while iv) balancing those \nfactors against costs in terms of finances & staff availability \n\u2022  factors that limit attendance of external CPD events include the ease with \nwhich doctors can take time away from their clinical work\/service delivery \nand  the number of clinicians within the particular specialty. Trusts varied in \nterms of being generous in allowing time to those that were not interested in \nCPD opportunities for their staff \n\u2022  on-line learning and CPD opportunities have become very popular with \nclinicians \n\u2022  the annual CPD allowance was considered too small in the context of the \ncosts incurred by attending an external CPD event Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 10 \n\u2022  the organisational perspective favours CPD activities that are recordable in \nsome measurable and quantifiable way in order to be seen to be conducting a \ntransparent and rigorous assessment procedure. \n \nA conception of CPD: a single scale or an ideologically shaped alternative option \n\u2022  \u201clearner-led CPD is the most successful because it encourages engagement \nand acknowledges professionalism\u201d and is most valid from and educational \nperspective \n\u2022  CPD is understood differently by those with organisational responsibilities \nto those who see it as part of their professional development \n\u2022  for CPD to be effective it must address the needs of individual clinicians, of \nthe populations they serve, the organisations within which they work as well \nas broader system-wide, national policies \n\u2022  the focus upon the acquisition of new or updated medical content knowledge \nin formal settings divides CPD needs and practice from everyday \nprofessional settings \n\u2022  the complexities of clinical areas can require delivery of care when there is  \nincomplete information. Thus an algorithmic approach to learning is not \nalways effective. \n\u2022  medical professionals form judgements, make decisions and execute them \nwhatever their clinical specialty and yet differing roles and contexts within \ntheir posts make different demands upon the CPD needs and the apparent \nease of fulfilling these needs for the purposes of assessment \n\u2022  CPD has both professional and personal aspects and there is some danger \nthat clinicians may choose to keep within their comfort zones when selecting \ntheir CPD activities \n\u2022  that CPD can take place in the workplace is not in question, rather the \nquestion is can CPD in the workplace be systematically assessed \n\u2022  formal CPD provision was perceived as undergoing changes in line with the \nproposed implementation of revalidation. These changes were perceived as \n\u201cindustrialising\u201d CPD in order to make it more uniform. \n \nReflection and its impact \n\u2022  for many, reflective learning tended to be regarded as superfluous and a \nnuisance while actually doing it but it was regarded positively and \nappreciatively retrospectively. Others saw themselves as having \nincorporated it into their day-to-day work and not something they did as \nextra \n\u2022  competition between the busy-ness of service delivery and time for \nreflection was often cited. \n \nDifferences between specialties \n\u2022  for the most part what doctors do it talk and thus communication, in all its \ncomplexity, is core to the entire profession of medicine \n\u2022  \u201cthe art of history taking\u201d, examining the evidence, forming judgements, \ntaking decisions are all core \n\u2022  some specialties, e.g., anaesthetics and emergency medicine have \u201cvery \nclear behaviour objectives\u201d Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 11 \n\u2022  other specialties, e.g., Psychiatry, adopt other approaches as learning models \nthat are better adapted to enabling \u201ca vast array of intellectual tying-\ntogether\u201d in all its \u201ccomplexity\u201d  \n\u2022  behavioural objectives are \u201cvisibles\u201d that can relatively easily be measured \nwhereas the judgements and decision making processes in Psychiatry for \nexample are \u201cinvisibles\u201d and qualitative. \n \nThe impact of recertification on CPD needs \n\u2022  many predicted that CPD assessment is more likely to become more \nquantifiable \n\u2022  some believed this to be a positive move towards greater accountability, \nwhile others spoke negatively of an accountability that would reduce the \nflexibility they valued in the current CPD system. \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 12 \nChapter 1: Introduction \n \nA recent definition provided by Directors of CPD Subcommittee of AoMRC is: \n \nA continuing process, outside formal undergraduate and postgraduate training, that \nenables individual doctors to maintain and improve standards of medical practice \nthrough the development of knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour, CPD should \nalso support specific changes in practice. \n \nArising from the literature review, it was considered that the definition of CPD \ncould be divided into two parts: \n \n\u2022  gaining knowledge \n\u2022  improving patient care. \n \nThe procedures for recording CPD were perceived as needing to address both of \nthese aspects. However, a body of literature claimed that a gain in knowledge does \nnot necessarily result in a change in behaviour by the clinician (Schostak 2009: 77). \nIf that is so, then other questions arise: \n \n\u2022  will an improvement in patient care occur? \n\u2022  and, if it does, how can it be measured? (Schostak, 2009: 77) \n \nHowever, before those are explored there needs to be a focus on what the literature \ntells us CPD is. \n \nThe nature of CPD  \nThe literature depicted CPD as keeping up-to-date with knowledge skills and \nattitudes (Schostak 2009: 67-8) clinically, managerially and professionally \n(Schostak 2009: 67) and saw it as being highly instrumental in coping with change \nat whatever level that occurs (clinical, managerial, technological, professional and \nso on (Schostak 2009: 69). It was seen as one of the key factors in delivering high \nquality care (Schostak 2009: 68) since the ultimate objective of engaging in it was \nto change the clinician\u2019s practice (Schostak 2009: 68).  \n \nCPD was often closely associated in the literature with appraisal and revalidation \nand was also linked to performance (Schostak 2009: 70; Guly\u2019s (2000) CPD cycle; \nSchostak 2009: 70-1). Not only was CPD described as \u201caspirational\u201d, it was also \nbe considered as being owned by the individual and not \u201crun by any agency\u201d \n(Schostak 2009: 71). \n \nDespite this, CPD was defined in operational terms as consisting of attendance at \nconferences and workshops at internal, local and national levels. In short then, most \nCPD activities were constructed as taking place outside of the everyday workplace \nsettings. \n \nThe meaning of effectiveness \nAny meaning we attribute to \u201ceffectiveness\u201d is to be left open because it is complex \nand multi-dimensional and accordingly, incompatible with measurement. \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 13 \nIts complexity arises from the need to improve practice (both personally and \nclinically) and to develop professionally, and from the dynamics of implementation \nin workplace settings, whatever they may be. \n \nAccordingly, in its broadest sense, effectiveness of CPD involves changes in the \ntotality of professional practice at both the personal and clinical levels. \n \nDeveloping principles for CPD \nAs CPD was viewed as going beyond what doctors do, its assessment would not be \npossible through a simple audit conducted by Colleges and Faculties (Schostak \n2009: 72). Given that the literature stated that there was \u201cno single, singular or \ncorrect way of doing CPD\u201d (Schostak 2009: 72), and that the content, context and \nprocesses chosen were going to depend upon spheres of practice, learning styles and \npersonal preferences (Schostak 2009: 72), the provision and assessment of CPD was \nseen in the literature as a high stakes business. This was reflected in the diverse \nrange of content in articles published in the literature expressing themes such as the \nexpectations of and demands by professionals on CPD. \n \nModalities \nFor the purposes of this and the discussion chapters (see chapter 5), it is useful to \ntake the perspective that CPD has two modalities, namely, the organisational and \nthe individual. While this distinction was not explicitly made in the literature \nconsulted during this study, its existence was strongly implied. \n \nThe organisational modality \nThere is a significant emphasis on flexibility of provision as well as a strong need \nfor justification and transparency in making judgements about quality, both of \nprovision and performance. The latter was invariably framed in terms of its \nrelationship to work-based practice and ongoing learning. This inevitably raises the \nissue of its relationship to assessment, recertification and revalidation. \n \nThe individual modality \nFrom the perspective of the individual doctor, the question that needs to be \naddressed is: what are the themes that CPD should address? The literature suggests \neight of these: \n \n\u2022  context and circumstance \n\u2022  knowledge \n\u2022  human factors\/non-technical skills \n\u2022  skills and practices (clinical know-how) \n\u2022  professional values and identities \n\u2022  decision-making \n\u2022  realisation and performance \n\u2022  approaches to identifying learning needs \n \nThis schemata has been constructed for the purposes of discussion in this report and \nas such, it is simplistic. In the real clinical day-to-day world, however, none of these \nconstructed categories stand alone but interact in a complex way referred to as \n\u201cpluralism\u201d, i.e., as multiple domains of actions (Schostak 2009: 80). \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 14 \nA summary of the literature review is in Chapter 3. The literature review in full can \nbe found in Appendix A1 of this report (Schostak, 2009). Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 15 \nChapter 2: Objectives, research design and methods \n \nPurpose of the research \nThe overall aim of this research was to identify what affects the effectiveness of \nCPD and thus formulate potential strategies.  \n \nResearch objectives and emergent research questions \nThe research had four broad objectives as shown below. Throughout the project, \neach objective has been explored in a number of ways as illustrated by one or more \nquestions that follow each research objective. These questions emerged from \nanalysis of the data and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. \n \nResearch objective 1: To compare and contrast the experiences of continuing \nprofessional development across the range of specialties, in terms of: \n\u2022  What do doctors understand by the term, \u201clearning\u201d and how does this \naffect their CPD? How are educational interventions distributed across \ninstitutional and more personal settings? How may workplace learning \noutcomes be noticed more effectively so that they can be included more \nfully in CPD accreditation? \n \nResearch objective 2: To identify and describe the range of CPD models employed \nacross the different specialties and clinical contexts, in terms of: \n\u2022  How are learning challenges culturally embeddeded\n1 in organisational and \nworkplace environments? How does\/do scientific and medical \nknowledge[s]\n2 shape the conceptions and conduct of professional \ninteractions?  \n\u2022  How does an organisational perspective shape conceptions of CPD needs? \nIn what ways does it seek to link these understandings to specific medical \nprofessional interests? \n\u2022  Is the conception of CPD resolvable on a singular scale or will it necessitate \nseveral options with ideological factors necessarily shaping the options \nenvisaged? \n \nResearch objective 3: To conceptualise the educational potential of reflective \npractice in CPD and its impact on professional practice, in terms of: \n\u2022  What do doctors understand by reflection and what examples do they give of \nimpact? \n \nResearch objective 4: To explore how different professionals judge the \neffectiveness of current CPD practices, in terms of: \n\u2022  Are there differences between specialties? \n \n                                                 \n1 Different cultural values, beliefs, knowledges and skills are implicated in or embedded in \ninteractions, networks, practices and day to day life and these have an impact upon what individuals \nthink, do and say. \n2 An analogy would be thinking inside the box and being unable or unwilling to think outside of it. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 16 \nResearch Design \nIn order to study the effectiveness of CPD it was necessary to develop a data \ncollection that could cover a broad range of clinical specialties as well as being able \nto focus on what actually happened in the clinical area. Employing both quantitative \nand qualitative methodologies enabled an in-depth analysis of CPD experiences to \nbe made. These were: \n \n\u2022  an on-line questionnaire. The broad themes and issues identified through a \nquestionnaire were then explored in more detail through: \n\u2022  interviews. However, what is written in questionnaires and said during \ninterviews does not always adequately represent the complexities of \neveryday clinical experience, therefore: \n\u2022  research activities in clinical settings was also part of the research design \n \nThis combination of strategies was able to reveal more fully the influence of \nculture, organisation and resources on the clinician\u2019s ability to effectively apply \nlearning. \n \nResearch Methods \nIn accordance with the research design, the methods below are organised in terms of \na) coverage and b) in-depth strategies. \n \n Coverage strategies \nLiterature review: \nA literature review was undertaken at the beginning of the project and constantly \nupdated throughout the lifetime of the project. The review covered:  \n \n\u2022  articles from a range of online journals \n\u2022  a small number of books \n\u2022  a wide range of online non-journal materials.  \n \nSee Appendix A1 for the full Literature Review with References and see Appendix \nA2 for the Bibliography. \n \nHowever, there has been little literature in terms of the evaluation of the \neffectiveness of CPD. Thus this project has explored this concept. \n \nQuestionnaire \nFollowing a pilot study conducted face to face at a College annual scientific \nmeeting, the questionnaire was placed online using Surveyor. This was made \navailable on the Advanced Life Support Group website during spring and early \nsummer 2008. While acknowledging the limitations of methodology, the research \nteam thought there was some value in using its capacity to gain access to relatively \nlarge numbers of doctors across a range of specialties. The questionnaire was \ndesigned to gain information about the nature of CPD and other learning \nexperiences, and contained descriptive and evaluative items and the opportunity for \nfree comment. Invitations to participate in the survey were issued by College \npresidents during the spring of 2008. Quantitative data were analysed using the data \ncollection tool and analysis of the free comments was facilitated by the use of \nNVivo. A copy of the questionnaire is appended in Appendix B. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 17 \n \nLetters to CPD Leads of all Medical Colleges and Faculties: \nA letter containing 13 questions was emailed in October 2007 to the CPD Leads of \nall Medical Colleges (twenty-five in total) with the request that they answer the \nquestions in situ in the letter attachment. A second mailing was undertaken through \nthe auspices of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in January 2008.  A copy \nof the letter is appended in Appendix C. \n \n In-depth strategies \nInterviews \nThe task was to explore in as much detail as possible the nature and effectiveness of \ninterviewees\u2019 CPD. In particular, we wanted to know what they meant by CPD and \nhow it related with other experiences of learning. During the interviews medical \npractitioners and managers described their experiences and each interview was \nrecorded. This study sought to understand how doctors learn in the context of \nvarious institutional settings (clinical or educational) and how that relates to more \npersonal or informal learning away from those institutions.  \n \nThe interview strategy has involved covering a range of experience from CPD lead \nto CPD user: \n \n1.  interviews with a number of CPD leads in order to cover all specialties \n2.  opportunistic interviews (ten to fifteen minutes duration) with CPD users at \nconferences to identify what kinds of impact a conference has and use this as \na way to talk further about how CPD impacts on practice \n3.  in-depth interviews of between half an hour to an hour (either telephone or \nface-to-face) with a range of respondents from academics, deans, consultants \nand GPs arranged in various ways: \n\u2022  by invitation through the auspices of some project team members \n\u2022  personal contacts of various project team members \n\u2022  further contacts suggested by a few interviewees themselves \n \nIn the final phase of the data collection in the research project the interview strategy \nfocused upon: \n \n1.  improving\/balancing the representation of the range of specialties as far as it \nwas possible with the assistance from Royal Academy of Medical Royal \nColleges and certain project team members \n2.  conducting in-depth 30 to forty-five minute interviews (mostly telephone) \nwith a range of respondents from the questionnaire in order to gain a more \nsystematic coverage of the range of CPD user views: 110 email invitations \nyielded 21 interviews \n \nThe aim was to analyse current practice, its effectiveness, the strategies employed at \nindividual, organisational and system levels as a basis for identifying strategies for \nimprovement. \n \nResearch in clinical settings: Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 18 \nA key purpose of researching clinical practice was to identify learning opportunities \nand how learning can be documented in the context of everyday practice. Two \nstrategies were adopted.  \n \nShadowing \nShadowing by the researcher studied clinicians engaging in professional decision-\nmaking processes in order to elicit a rich in-depth analysis of a range of actual \noccurrences in clinical practices and clinical settings. Shadowing provided the \nopportunity to test out the extent to which learning in its most general senses can be \nintegrated with day-to-day practice and the extent to which learning during formal \nperiods of CPD could be applied during practice. \n \nIn more detail the objectives of the shadowing process were: \n1.  to identify the typical patterns of work during shifts \n2.  to build a picture of the pressures of everyday work \n3.  to experience and thus be able to describe in depth a range of actual events \nduring which clinicians engage in professional decision making processes \nappropriate to their role \n4.  to reflect with the clinician on aspects of their work seen during the \nshadowing in order to:  \na.  identify particular CPD\/work-based learning needs and opportunities \nas well as any issues that may hinder CPD\/work-based learning \nb.  identify contextual factors that have an impact on the relation \nbetween service delivery and learning and the extent to which \nchanges may be made following from CPD\/learning \nc.  identify the extent to which the clinical area can support learning \n \nThis combination of in-depth strategies aimed to provide a comprehensive \nappreciation of the influence of culture, organisation and resourcing on how \nclinicians can effectively both learn and apply learning. \n \nAction Research \nFor an action research perspective on ongoing research within the project, see \nAppendix E. \n \nEthics of research design \nIn chapters 4 and 5, all references to names of people and Trusts have been \nanonymised to maintain confidentiality. However, inasmuch as one of the \nobjectives of the project was to report on a range of medical specialties, the name of \nthe specialty is retained unless the actual naming of it compromises anonymity. \nProfessionals from Deaneries and Medical Schools have been likewise anonymised \nand their actual physical locations are not referenced. Similarly CPD Leads, who \nwere interviewed, have also been anonymised. \n \nAll interviewees were informed of the purposes of the research and the use of the \ndata i) when initially approached to take part and ii) immediately before the \nresearch began and they could withdraw from participation at any time. Methods of \nensuring anonymisation and confidentiality of the data were always discussed at \nlength both at the initial approach and again just before starting the research process \nitself.  Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 19 \n \nShadowing was explained via leaflet provision and consent was obtained from those \ninvolved. Ethical approval was granted by Lewisham Local Research Ethics \nCommittee. \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 20 \nChapter 3: Literature survey \u2013 a resum\u00e9 \n \nIn order to provide a more informed introduction to the research findings, a resum\u00e9 \nof the literature review is presented here as numbered themes and issues. Each of \nthese focus around concerns to do with the notion of keeping up to date, how \nlearning takes place, how learning addresses day-to-day needs as well longer term \ncareer and professional development and how learning can be recorded and \nassessed. These concerns will be further developed in the discussion on the findings \nof the research. Areas of concern are outlined in brief in Chapter 1. What follows is \na more detailed exploration of the issues from the literature. \n \nThere are two key tensions to be addressed. The first is deals with learning and the \nease with which it can be objectively recorded and measured. \n \nThe second tension is between learning and service delivery. Learning comes under \nthe heading of education whereas service delivery comes under the heading of \nmeeting patient needs. The literature only indirectly addresses this critical issue \nhence limiting the development of the quality and relevance of CPD. \n \nThe nature of CPD \nThe literature depicted CPD as keeping up-to-date with knowledge, skills and \nattitudes (Schostak 2009: 67-8) clinically, managerially and professionally \n(Schostak 2009: 67) and saw it as being highly instrumental in coping with change \nat whatever level that occurs (Schostak 2009: 69). It was seen as one of the key \nfactors in delivering high quality care (Schostak 2009: 68) since the ultimate \nobjective of engaging in it was to change the clinician\u2019s practice (Schostak 2009: \n68).  \n \nCPD was often closely associated in the literature with appraisal and revalidation \nand was also linked to performance (Schostak 2009: 70; Guly\u2019s (2000); CPD cycle \nSchostak 2009: 70-1). Not only was CPD described as \u201caspirational,\u201d it was also \nbe considered as being owned by the individual and not \u201crun by any agency\u201d \n(Schostak 2009: 71). \n \nAnd yet for the most part CPD activities were constructed as taking place outside of \nthe everyday workplace settings. \n \nDeveloping principles for CPD \nCPD was viewed as going beyond what doctors do. Colleges and Faculties, \ntherefore were not able to assess it by conducting a simple audit (Schostak 2009: \n72). Given that the literature stated that there was \u201cno single, singular or correct \nway of doing CPD\u201d (Schostak 2009: 72), and that the content, context and \nprocesses chosen were going to depend upon spheres of practice, learning styles and \npersonal preferences (Schostak 2009: 72), the provision and assessment of CPD was \nseen in the literature as a high stakes business. This was reflected in the diverse \nrange of content in articles published in the literature expressing themes such as the \nexpectations of and the demands made on and by professionals of CPD. \n \nModalities Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 21 \nFor the purposes of the discussion in this chapter and the discussion chapter of this \nReport, however, it is useful to take the perspective that CPD has two modalities, \nnamely, the organisational and the individual. While this distinction was not \nexplicitly made in the literature consulted during this study, its existence was \nimplicit. \n \nOrganisational modality \nFlexibility \nIt can be seen from what has been already argued that flexibility was frequently \ncited as an important principle for developing CPD (Schostak 2009: 68, 71). \nAlongside this, the literature pointed to the need for principles of justification and of \ntransparency to govern the procedures necessary for revalidation\/poor performance \n(Schostak 2009: 72).  \n \nThe evidence in the literature indicated that successful learning was much more \nlikely to occur through active modes of learning than through passive ones \n(Schostak 2009: 73). This typically involved linking CPD with needs analysis \nassessments and the development of multiple learning activities (Schostak 2009: \n74). Furthermore, CPD was described as being at the heart of knowledge \ntranslation, bridging the transitions from theoretical to practice (Schostak 2009: 73). \nAnother recurrent theme, centred upon minimizing the gap between theory and \npractice, was the principle of ensuring that knowledge does not remain abstract, i.e., \nas something that is learnt outside the practice arena. Thus the literature \nrecommended that effective knowledge should be integrated with everyday working \npractices, and combined with follow-up activities in order to ensure reinforcement \nand critical development, such as real-time or virtual discussion with peers \n(Schostak 2009: 74). This could be enhanced by developing partnership and \ncollaborative activities (Schostak 2009: 74). \n \nAssessing and Accrediting CPD: issues and\/or questions \nEvidence for CPD undertaken linked to an audit of adequacy of an individual\u2019s \nprogramme was described as a possible method of assessing CPD activities \n(Schostak 2009: 74). As seen previously, the need for flexibility had implications \nfor assessment procedures. Self-accounting with quality assurance through the \nappraisal system was described as constituting one strategy capable of addressing \nthe huge diversity of practice (Schostak 2009: 74). \n \nThe literature review suggested that professionals were more likely to change their \npractice after a learning needs analysis had been conducted.  \n \nMonitoring such diversity was seen to be a huge challenge. Strategies such as \nadopting an \u201cevents or products\u201d (Starke and Wade, 2005, cited in Schostak 2009: \n69, 74) approach raised as many questions as they solved (Schostak 2009: 75); \nparticularly with regard to quality assurance. \n \nProviders of CPD \nA typical list of CPD providers included Colleges, Faculties; in-house NHS \nprogrammes; management training; multi-professional trainers, e.g., the Kings \nFund; commerce and industry; and Universities (Schostak 2009: 75-76). Online Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 22 \nprovision examples cited in the Literature included the familiar and commonly used \nMCQs and the less frequently used podcasts, for example (Schostak 2009: 75).  \n \nRecording CPD activities \u2013 questions and issues \nThe definition of CPD was divided into two parts, firstly, it was described as \ngaining knowledge and, secondly, it was associated with improving patient care. \nThe procedures for recording CPD were perceived as needing to address both of \nthese aspects. However, a body of literature claimed that a gain in knowledge does \nnot necessarily result in a change in behaviour by the clinician (Schostak 2009: 76). \nIf that is so then how can effectiveness be measured? (Schostak 2009: 76).  \n \nWhat recording procedures should be adopted (Schostak 2009: 76)? The range \nsuggested included: personal portfolios; competency frameworks; PDPs arising \nfrom appraisals; in an online diary held on each college\u2019s or faculty\u2019s website; a \nself-audit measured against peer group or national standards; case review and \nreflection; MSF; patient questionnaires (Schostak 2009: 76-7).  \n \nCPD was described as an activity or set of activities that cannot be viewed as an \nentity distinct from appraisal and revalidation (Schostak 2009: 77). It also followed \nthat delivering a service and ensuring access to and attendance of educational CPD \nactivities were similarly complexly intertwined (Schostak 2009: 77-8).  \n \nBoundary issues: CPD or quality assurance \nA possibility explored in the literature (Schostak 2009: 78) was that there is a \ndanger of CPD being confused with quality assurance.  \n \nOne article described the Diamond Model of Quality Assurance which was adapted \nto produce the Quality Assurance CPD (QACPD) Framework as a potential \nworkable model (Schostak 2009: 79) that would provide space for both CPD and \nquality assurance. In this Diamond Model, quality assurance sat in the centre of a \ndiamond shaped figure bounded at its four points by one of four key components of \norganisational activity for CPD.  These four key components were strategy, \nstructures, resources and outcomes. \n \nIndividual modality \nThe literature was analysed with respect to eight issues\/needs: \n \n1) contextual and circumstance: taking into account the idiosyncrasies of the \nvarious medical specialities.  \n2) knowledge: typically this was viewed as something that could be added to, \nreaffirmed and refreshed (Schostak 2009: 81). The meaning of knowledge \nwas also explored in the literature, given that we live in the real-world of \nchangeable unpredictable situations (Schostak 2009: 81). There are many \neducational models cited in the literature and thus the process of selecting one \nor some of these is an important one since the selection will have implications \n(Schostak 2009: 81-3). \n3) social: i.e. human factors or non technical issues for example, team-work and \ncommunication issues. \n4) skills and practice(s): in the literature this took the form of adding to a \nrepertoire of clinical know-how; affirming practice; the use of and place for Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 23 \nadherence models, e.g., following guidelines; engaging in critical thinking \nonly when it is called for; sequencing models; developing a notion of a \nstandard of care that is situation specific that defies definition but revolves \naround contexts of expert witnesses, clinical guidelines, journal articles, \npharmaceutical packet inserts and manufacturing instructions, etc., (Schostak \n2009: 83).  \n5) professional values and identities: the literature supported a common core for \nall medical specialties but the differences between specialties were also \ncelebrated. A mini-scoping exercise revealed, for example,  \nPsychiatry: made use of peer groups to validate CPD activities and of \npersonal plans. Often these groups become action learning sets \n(Revans 1982); \nPaediatrics: in America, the specialty has launched the Internet Learning \nSystem known as PediaLink) (Schostak 2009: 83). It was based on a \ntheory of clinical problem solving adopted from Donald Sch\u00f6n\u2019s cycle \nof learning (1983). Thus members were able to facilitate and document \nthe process of self-directed learning (Schostak 2009: 84); \nSurgery: the specialty emphasised the quality of learning and the \nappropriateness of CPD to individual practice and career development \nand was trying to get away from the practice of accruing points \n(Schostak 2009: 84). The November 2004 dossier emphasised the \n\u201cvalue and nature of reflective practice\u201d pointing out that \u201creflective \nlearning is rooted in clinical and professional practice\u201d (Schostak \n2009: 86); \nGeneral Practice: the RCGP website detailed the co-ordination between \nthe different organisational bodies related to and instrumental in the \nworking of general practice. These included the GMC, PCOs, \nDeaneries, PCTs and of course the RCGP itself (Schostak 2009: 86). \n6) decision making: the literature indicated that there were two types of decision \nmaking processes. The first was the normative\/ formalized idealized type. The \nsecond was the descriptive\/practical approach, e.g., Croskerry\u2019s (2003 cited in \nSchostak 2009:82, 89, 90) \u201cflesh and blood\u201d decision making in which \nmental simulation is combined with situation assessment in order to assess \ncourses of action following the \u201crecognition primed decision\u201d model of Klein \net al (Schostak 2009: 89).  \nAs would be expected, decision making was seen as very dependant upon the \ndata gathered, e.g., from history-taking, physical examination, investigatory \ntests etc., (Schostak 2009: 89). It was also dependent upon models of \njudgement such as i) pattern recognition; ii) ruling out the worst case scenario; \niii) exhaustive method; iv) hypotheticodeductive method; v) heuristics; vi) the \nevent in which symptoms are treated and then re-evaluated after evaluation of \nthe response to treatment (Schostak 2009: 89).  \nThe literature claimed that clinicians believed they were making naturalistic \nschema driven decision approaches. They always compared the relationship \nbetween the patient\u2019s story and the \u201ctextbook\u201d norm, although this action is \nnot a simple case of comparison and contrast (Schostak 2009: 89). \nNevertheless models remained models and were viewed as being too crude to \ndescribe how salient professionals make clinical judgements that inform real-\ntime complex decision making processes (Schostak 2009: 90). The need for \ncritical thinking was seen as imperative in order to distinguish foreground Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 24 \nfrom distracting background stimuli, bias, irrelevance and propaganda \n(Schostak 2009: 90). \n7) knowledge and performance: the role of the literature here was to examine the \nissues around the boundary between CPD and quality assurance, for example \nin medical error reduction (Schostak 2009: 90). \n8) identifying personal learning needs,: the literature provided a range of models, \ne.g., Guly, (2000) Kolb (1984), Daley (1989), an educational model that \ndistinguished between education as a product, or process, or research. Critical \nthinking was deemed essential, as was the ability to find evidence. Wears and   \nNemeth (2007) suggested that making a diagnosis should be viewed as \noperating through perspectives and sense-making because this type of model \nchanged to real-world problems that relate more directly to medical problems \nthemselves (Schostak 2009: 91). \n \nThis schemata of categories as constructed for the discussion in this report is too \nsimplistic, however. In the real clinical day-to-day world, none of these constructed \ncategories stand alone but interact in a complex way referred to as pluralism, i.e., as \nmultiple domains of actions (Schostak 2009: 80). Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 25 \nChapter 4: Results and findings \n \nThe results and findings address both the need to cover the range of experience and \nopinion as well as explore these in-depth by interview and observation\/shadowing.  \n \nThe first section will focus upon coverage in terms of: \n1.  summarising results from the questionnaire \n2.  summarising findings from the letter to CPD leads \n \nand the second section will focus upon findings from the in-depth strategies in terms \nof: \n1.  themes and issues that have been drawn from interview transcripts \n2.  themes and issues that have been drawn from carrying out shadowing \nactivities \n \nCoverage strategies \nLiterature Review \nThe key issues that have been identified in the literature review provided insights \ninto the kinds of questions to ask by questionnaire and in interviews. It also \nidentified key issues in relation to current CPD practices (see Chapter 1). These \nincluded: the education versus service polarities; the education versus training \ndebates; the importance of work-based learning in achieving changes in practice and \nbenefits for patient outcomes (thereby incorporating the two basic tenets of the \nGMC definition of CPD); the changing learning needs and therefore CPD provision \nthat occur as the clinician progresses along the career path. \n \nCoverage \nQuestionnaire \nThere were 1016 respondents but 113 were disqualified as they were not \nconsultants, staff grades or Associate specialists. These data, however, will be \nprocessed in order to compare responses with their consultant colleagues for a \nfuture report. \n \nThe 902 returns are only slightly less than the 1000 anticipated. There were 635 \nmale and 267 female respondents with a combined average age of 48.

A summarized overview of the \nresponses is as follows: Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 29 \n \nQ1:   What guidelines\/advice does your organisation give to its members about \nundertaking CPD activities? \nResponses varied widely from recommendations on reflection and \nblended learning to a description of the credit points system and \nindividual credit point categories. \nQ2:   How are guidelines\/advice provided? \nMethods of communications were: online (emails, web, Bulletins), \nmail (letters) and organisational infrastructures (CPD Advisors, \nCollege Tutors, CPD Forum) \nQ3:   Do members provide feedback to your organisation on the guideline\/advice \noffered? If so, how? \nResponses pointed to the use of meetings, informal queries via DoCPD \nmembers and of web-based systems. \nQ4:   What is the range of educational opportunities provided by your \norganisation? \nResponses indicate local and national provision of courses, e-learning \nmodules, seminars, workshops, conferences, journals and training \ntrainer programmes. \nQ5:   How do you identify the need for specific CPD topics? \nResponses varied from micro-level approaches, e.g., sounding out \nmembers at Congress, discussion with colleagues, from learning needs \nanalysis for interests groups, and through efforts of enthusiasts, to the \nmacro-level of local and national support systems, from CPD returns \nand by setting up educational resource centres. \nQ6:   How do you guide your fellows to do specific CPD topics? \nKey themes were flexibility and signposting and thus methods of \nguidance ranged widely from publicity at meetings, or online on \nwebsites or web-based tools designated for this purpose, or via \npresidential bulletins. Use was also made of newsletters, of \ndesignating and kite-marking specific courses, or allocation of credit \npoints for specific categories of CPD activity that include a variety of \npossible activities (e.g., external\/internal scientific to private study). \nQ7:   Is the membership uptake measured? \nResponses range from confirmation to an intention to measure it in the \nfuture. \nQ8:   If so, how is it audited? \nA variety of auditing procedures on CPD annual returns where used. \nThis will be discussed in greater detail in the Discussion Chapter. \nQ9:   How do your fellows record their CPD? \nThe use of diaries (paper or online) was the most popular method with \nePortfolios second. \nQ10:   What are the characteristics of your organisation\u2019s CPD target audience? \nMale to female ratios varied within Colleges\/Faculties. The ratio \napproached the 50\/50 mark in one, and it was approximately 60\/40 in \ntwo other colleges. A number of other Colleges\/Faculties declared they \ndid not measure their audience\u2019s characteristics. \nQ11:   Do members provide feedback to the organisation on the guidelines\/ advice \noffered? If so, how? Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 30 \nResponses indicated use of organisational infrastructures such as an \nonline forum, email options, as well as use of CPD coordinators and \nfilling in feedback forms having attended ear-marked conferences. \nQ12:   What methods does your organisation use to evaluate the effectiveness of \nCPD provision? \nResponses ranged from none and no formal methods through \nevaluation forms at meetings and \u201can open culture encouraging \nfeedback in general\u201d to an audit of member\u2019s activities. \nQ13:   Do you have any literature on effectiveness of CPD in your specialty? If so, \nplease could you list the relevant references. \nAll those Colleges\/ Faculties who responded replied that they had no \nsuch literature. \n \nIn-depth strategies \nInterviews \nEighty-four interviews have been completed and the range of interviewees included \nmanagers, CPD Leads and consultants across a broad spectrum of medical \nspecialties and Post Graduate roles. The aim was to compare and contrast the \nperspectives of CPD providers and users. \n \nThe table below summarises the Specialties and professional roles of interviewees: \n \n \nMedical Specialties  Total number of interviews \nEmergency Medicine   15 \nPhysicians  16 \nSurgeons  10 \nPaediatricians   2 \nAnaesthetists   2 \nGeneral Practitioners   4 \nPsychiatrists   7 \nObstetrics & Gynaecology   1 \nPublic Health   1 \nPathologists   4 \nOpthamologists   1 \nOccupational Health   1 \nRegistered Paramedic   1 \nPublic Health   1 \nPostgrad Deans   5 \nAssociate Deans   3 \nExecutive Directors   1 \nAssistant Directors   1 \nDirectors of CPD\/CPD Leads   4 \nAcademics\/Medical School   4 \n   \nTotal number of interviews  84 \n   \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 31 \n[Key: no names of interviewees have been double-counted, e.g., if they are \nlisted as CPD Leads then they are not counted again in their particular \nspecialty] \n \nResearch in clinical settings \nShadowing by the researcher has taken place in i) an Emergency Department in an \nurban DGH; ii) in an outpatients clinic in a metropolitan DGH; and iii) on a post-\ntake ward round in an urban  DGH. A small excerpt from the researcher\u2019s field-\nnotes illuminates one of the findings from the literature review as follows: \n \nThe continual tension between service delivery and training or educational \nneeds is illustrated, for example, when the specialist registrar sits down to \nwrite up the notes of the patient last seen. Head down, pen poised, mind \nfocused on the clinical details of history taken, physical examination \nperformed and investigations ordered, that have just occurred prior to \nreturning to the office, the registrar begins to write the first sentence, but, no \nsooner has he started than he finds himself interrupted by a case presentation \nfrom a doctor more junior to himself. It doesn\u2019t happen once or twice either. \nMostly it\u2019s a more junior doctor requiring anything from reassurance through \nguidance to an explicit \u201chow to do\u201d advice, occasionally it\u2019s a nurse needing \nthe registrar\u2019s informed signature, (i.e., he skims the clinical notes, approves \nthe designated medication and checks the dosage) for a drug prescription. \n(Schostak; excerpt from field-notes: April 2008) \n \nThis excerpt attempts to convey something of the dynamics of clinical practice in \naction together with the complexities of the clinical settings against which \neducational opportunities and service delivery requirements interact with each other \nin positive ways at times and vie with each other for resources of various kinds at \nother times. This is the backdrop against which CPD must function effectively: this \nis the reality test for CPD, in other words. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 32 \nChapter 5: Discussion \n \nThis chapter will explore the results and findings by developing the following key \nquestions that emerged from the research objectives (see page 4) and from analysis \nof the data: \n \n1.  What do doctors understand by the word \u201clearning\u201d and how does this \naffect their CPD? How are educational interventions distributed across \ninstitutional and more personal settings? How may workplace learning \noutcomes be noticed more effectively so that they can be included more \nfully in CPD accreditation?  \n2.  How are learning challenges culturally embedded in organisational and \nworkplace environments? How does scientific and medical knowledge shape \nthe conceptions and conduct of professional interactions? \n3.  How does an organisational perspective shape conceptions of CPD needs? \nIn what ways does it seek to link these understandings to specific medical \nprofessional interests? \n4.  Is the conception of CPD resolvable on a singular scale or will it necessitate \nseveral options with ideological factors necessarily shaping the options \nenvisaged?  \n5.  What do doctors understand by reflection and what examples do they give of \nimpact? \n6.  Are there differences between specialties? \n \nThe focus of the discussion will be to identify the range of arguments that can be \ntaken on a given issue posed by asking these questions. Although the questionnaire \ndata provides some indication of the pervasiveness of views, the strength or \nsignificance of an argument does not rest upon the number of people making a \nparticular claim. Interviews enable arguments to be explored irrespective of whether \nor not, such arguments influence policy. They also enable the assessment of what is \nat stake in adopting particular arguments for policy making. \n \nDoctors\u2019 understanding of the word \u201clearning\u201d and the effect on CPD \nLearning and CPD \nAll clinicians when interviewed described CPD in terms of learning. \u201cThe day you \nstop learning is the day you shouldn\u2019t be doing the job\u201d, one consultant said in an \ninterview. This learning was described as being of two types: either it was learning \nsomething new or it was learning that what they were doing was what everybody \nelse was doing and therefore indicative of \u201cgood practice\u201d. This is a form of \nprofessional triangulation, that is, a process of comparing experience about similar \nactivities across a range of professional perspectives in order to find what is \ncommon, what is different and what is contrasting. It is not carried out in a \nsystematic manner as would be the case in research procedures. Nevertheless, it is a \nway of constructing what may be called a process for the public development and \nsharing of professional knowledge, skills and experience. However, just because \neveryone is doing something does not necessarily mean it is good or indeed the best \npractice possible, but it does provide a quasi-public base-line from which to reflect \nupon evidence and assess practice. This description was generic across the \nrespondents. It suggests that CPD could be employed to make this process more Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 33 \nsystematic, rigorous and robust in terms of formulating procedures for \u201cvalidity \nchecking\u201d. \n \nValidity checking is part of professional reflection where, in the words of one \ninterviewee: \u201cLearning is not just acquiring information. It\u2019s learning what you\u2019ve \ndone wrong and doing it right, learning from what you\u2019re doing right and doing it \nbetter, learning what you are doing very well and, perhaps, passing that message \nonto your colleagues who may be doing not quite as well\u201d. The issue for CPD is \nhow to elaborate, in a systematic way, upon the normal practices of professionals as \nthey endeavour to assess and communicate their own practice. It is about taking \nadvantage of what professionals already do by embedding more systematic \nprocedures of CPD into everyday culture. How this might be done, however, is \nproblematic. \n \nA vital role of CPD is that of ensuring that everyday practice is best practice. The \nlatter is always informed by research on new knowledge, skills, techniques or \ninnovatory practice. Learning something new was described as \u201ckeeping up-to-\ndate\u201d and as \u201ckeeping my practice up-to-date\u201d. This learning might have involved \nsomething new, or something to be \u201cre-learned\u201d because it wasn\u2019t \u201cquite at the \nfront of your brain\u201d, or it might have involved looking at something from \u201ca \ndifferent angle\u201d. This again, is a process of triangulation where the different \nviewpoints on an object reveal different qualities, features or structures. CPD can \nsystematise such naturally occurring cultural practices by deliberately providing a \nrange of different approaches, variations in practice, and changes in viewpoint in \norder to enrich the experience, practice and knowledge of professionals. \n \nThe nature of what was newly learned varied according to professional roles and \nfrom specialty to specialty. It ranged through such categories as knowledge, \npsychomotor skills, managerial skills, leadership skills, technological skills, \nimplementation, appraiser of literature, screening of research proposals and \nmediation. The other dimension to learning was variously described as \n\u201caffirmation\u201d, as  \u201creaffirmation\u201d, as \u201cconfirming my own practice\u201d, as \u201chaving \nmy thoughts confirmed by somebody else\u201d, and \u201csomething that [\u2026] confirms any \nuncertainties I may have had about my own level of knowledge, [and] so reassures \nme that I know what I\u2019m doing\u201d. \n \nThe questionnaire results supported the interview findings. They indicated the \nextent to which the engagement with CPD was a consequence of interest in the \nsubject matter, the opportunity to reflect on practice and to fill a knowledge or skills \ngap. All of these could contribute to changes in treatment practices (69% \nagreement). One respondent wrote about the value of \u201cattending an international \nconference in my specialty which afforded me learning in the practicality of my \nspecialty but also importantly allowed me to reflect on how the current practice \nwithin my own department stacks up against National and International standards\u201d. \n \nThere were variations in articulations of \u201ckeeping up-to-date\u201d and\/or confirming \ngood practice. Attending conferences, workshops and in-house meetings, such as \ngrand rounds and journal clubs were all mentioned in interviews. Other modes \nincluded consultants \u201csharing surgical theatre sessions\u201d and interactions with \ncolleagues (peers, juniors, other healthcare professionals). Not only was a Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 34 \nconference a \u201cchance to network and to talk to colleagues\u201d, explained the \ninterviewee, but it\u2019s \u201crather like going round a library in that you serendipitously \nfind out things that it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to you to look for in the first place\u201d. \n \nIs it the case though, as one interviewee working in a Postgraduate Deanery put it, \nthat, instead of \u201cusing CPD as a real opportunity to uncover their unknowns\u201d, most \nindividuals will use the CPD and learning cautiously and not venture out of their \ncomfort zones? This was because of the \u201cscoring\u201d through which CPD is assessed \nand accredited, observed another interviewee whose post involves a half-time \nclinical role and half-time academic role. That consultants tended to stay in their \ncomfort zones is like junior doctors deliberately selecting their non-contentious \ncases for the assessment procedure. Not only does this behaviour make a doctor \nlook competent, it is also a relatively easy option compared to taking a risk with \nsomething with which is unfamiliar and that would take more effort and time to \nmaster. \u201cScoring\u201d fosters such behaviour. Another consultant told the interviewer \nthat, while he \u201cfeels very small\u201d for doing so, nevertheless, \u201cfor my appraisal, I \nkeep all my thank you letters and any cards that I receive\u201d from former patients as a \nmeasure of his competencies and of his performance level. In this interviewee\u2019s \neyes, such actions were not those of a professional since professionalism is \nconcerned with self-regulation and with notions of trust with members of society.  \n \nNevertheless he continued to do what made him \u201cfeel small\u201d in order to best \nrepresent himself within the appraisal and CPD systems in use at this time. This is \nyet another manifestation of scoring. And this is accompanied by an institutional \nprivileging of a tick-box approach to CPD assessment. What is at stake in adopting \napproaches that score CPD? How can they not have an impact on a sense of \nprofessionalism and upon the ways in which professional practice is undertaken? \n \nA large number of interviewees believed that alternatives exist. The interviewee \ncited above, talking about the problems with scoring, articulated his thoughts \nfurther, saying, rather \u201cit\u2019s this ability to be able to critique yourself and be able to \nlook at what your decisions are and look at it critically and learn from the process\u201d \nthat is important in professionalism. This interviewee emphasised his point even \nfurther by saying he would be \u201cfar more confident\u201d about a doctor treating him if \nthat doctor had been \u201cthrough an appraisal process in which they had to critique \ntheir own performance and actually had admitted they had got some stuff wrong \nand learnt from the process\u201d than being treated by a doctor who had gone \u201cthrough \nan appraisal process in which they said, \u2018oh yes I\u2019m still up to date and I\u2019ve ticked \nall the boxes and I know everything\u2019.\u201d  Making this distinction between \nperformance and the judgements and decisions that led to that performance is a \nsubtle act but necessary and \u201cI think it is that structure and the process of being \nable to appraise your own performance that we need to get better at\u201d. Performance \nis a visible entity: it can be seen and that in itself leads to an enabling of \nmechanisms for measurement and standardisation to be put in place. However, the \nformation of judgements and the making of decisions are much less visible and thus \nresistant to quantitative systems of measurement and standardization. In the words \nof Fish and de Cossart (2007), performance is more \u201cvisible\u201d whereas judgement \nand decision making are \u201cinvisibles\u201d, being different and more reflective (and, in \nthe words of another interviewee (see page 57ff in this chapter), compatible with a \nmore qualitative assessment procedure. We will return to this point later. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 35 \n \nCPD as learning \nWhen asked to talk about CPD in the context of learning, interviewees from all \nspecialties often linked CPD to \u201cthat which I need to do my job effectively\u201d, and a \nnumber talked about it as \u201cthat which I need to do to develop me as a person \nbecause I need to move to the next level\u201d. One consultant explained that, while she \ntended to \u201cequate CPD with learning\u201d, she did not equate it \u201cwith formal \nattendance at a conference\u201d. Often it was linked to personal \u201clearning needs\u201d and \ntherefore it would involve activities that would be i) \u201cappropriate for those \nlearning needs, in [one\u2019s] preferred learning style\u201d and ii) that would \u201cresult in \nlearning outcomes that are mostly translated into practice\u201d. Thus it appears that \ninterviewees envisaged CPD as a particular approach to learning that involved being \na professional, and with moving on along a career path. \n \nFrequently, in both interviews and questionnaires, CPD was also explicitly \nassociated with appraisals. Fifty per cent of the questionnaire respondents \nconsidered appraisal to be a motivation for CPD. One interviewee explained, \u201cI\u2019m \neither reaching the mark or there are things I need to do to improve, otherwise it\u2019s \nnot development\u201d. This particular explanation implied the need in the professional \nrole to i) attain a standardised threshold; ii) undergo a measurement procedure; iii) \nset about implementing improvements if necessary; iv) be committed to \ndevelopment, viewing it as an integral part of working life\u2019 and v) in this particular \ncontext apparently be accepting of this system. There is a simple logic to this \nperspective: a doctor is either good enough or not and, if the latter is the case, steps \nhave to be taken. If there is a deficit, it needs to be remedied. One way of doing this \nis to engage in a learning needs analysis, with the appraiser, for example. This \nidentifies a gap in skills (clinical, leadership, communication, management, etc.) or \nin knowledge and so on. Shortcomings can then be addressed and remedied over the \nforthcoming year. At the end of that year, at the next annual appraisal, a return to \nthe appraiser with an indication of what has been done, can demonstrate that a, b \nand c have been learned and will be incorporated into professional working life in \norder to become a more effective practitioner\/professional. This may be called the \nengineering model of CPD. It may be that the simple logic of seeing a gap and \nfilling it is not actually appropriate for all learning opportunities. In the words of \none interviewee: \u201cDoctors don\u2019t work like that\u201d. \n \nIf a patient arrives with a clinical problem with which a doctor is unfamiliar, the \ndoctor cannot wait for their appraisal to show that they have looked into the \nproblem and learned from these searches for further information on what it is, what \nto do, and how to do it. Doctors may need to look into the problem immediately as a \nmatter of urgency or they may have a longer time period in which to update \nthemselves and their practice. Given that some assessment is required, this \nborrowed managerial model linking CPD to the appraisal system might make sense \nbureaucratically in keeping with a managerial model, but for clinical practice it \nmakes no sense. While this is a fairly simplistic response to the example of simple \nlogic given above, the argument it presents is not to be dismissed so easily. To \nreturn to the notion of the visibles and invisibles discussed above, it is interesting to \nnote that the simple logic is explained in a language that evokes the visible \nperformance with its reference to \u201creaching the mark\u201d and of \u201cthings to do\u201d if that \nmark is not reached. However, the interviewee who argued that this is not how Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 36 \ndoctors work, used words to paint a scenario to suggest the invisibles of judgements \nand decision making make for a more complex picture for professional medicine. \nFurthermore, what was also implied is that, at times, the use of simple logic will not \nbe sufficient to deal with the complexities of medical practice. If CPD activities are \nto address these complexities, then recording and assessing CPD activities would \nhave to be flexible enough to address what is actually involved in changing what \ndoctors do and how they do it, as a basis for improving patient care. Thus what is at \nissue here is the scope of CPD \u2013 where does it begin and end? For example, \noccasionally interviewees linked CPD with Personal Development Plans. One \ninterviewee explained \u201cour PDP structure\u201d is all about \u201cprofessional development \n\u2026except a section of it is learning activity and that is CPD\u201d. This boundary \nbetween the two activities may help or hinder the capacity of CPD to bring about \nchange. \n \nWhile interviewees associated CPD with the notion of development they rarely \nexamined its various facets. The explicit notion of moving on, of professional \nprogression, and of development was articulated clearly and precisely by far fewer \ninterviewees, and those who did articulate it tended to have either more specifically \ndesignated managerial or teaching roles to their professional posts. Those \nindividuals working in Deaneries, Universities and other institutions often held \nresponsibilities for implementing ways of moving people on in their careers and \nthence the notion of continuous-ness and of progression was high on their \nprofessional agendas whereas it was more likely that case-based scenarios took \nprecedence for busy NHS consultants. While all interviewees were members of the \nmedical profession, the nature of progression and moving people on was much more \nvisible for a clinician whose post comprised of being a clinician for half a week and \nworking at the Deanery for the rest of the week when compared to a busy NHS \nconsultant working in a small department in a DGH, for example. Individuals were \nmuch more likely to talk about the more visible and the more frequently occurring \nparts of their roles. Data from the questionnaire, however, indicated that 40% of \nrespondents saw progression as a key motivator.  \n \nProfessional roles within medicine range from what a number of interviewees called \nthe \u201cjobbing day-to-day doctor\u201d in clinics, on wards, in operating theatres, in \nlaboratories, in mortuaries, through to clinical managers and\/or leaders, to academic \nresearchers and up to CPD \u2018Leads\u2019 in institutions such as Royal Colleges, Faculties \nand out to members in Deaneries and Universities. The term \u201cjobbing day-to-day \ndoctors\u201d suggests a homogeneous group, but that is far from the truth. Some busy \nNHS consultants spent their clinical day carrying out specialised medicine, such as \nkidney transplants, and yet nevertheless, since they were surgeons, they were part of \nthe emergency surgical take rota, and, in this role, their general surgical skills were \nwhat was required and what had to be kept up to date. Attending particular \nconferences, for example the Association of General Surgeons of Great Britain and \nIreland, and targeting specific parts of the conference programme were described as \nuseful for ensuring that the clinical knowledge, skills and management were all kept \nup to date. \n \nA broad range of professional roles demands a long list of different professional \nrequirements and thus the CPD activities that are available must meet these very \ndiverse needs in order to be effective. While there is no denying core similarities in Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 37 \nterms of the clinical knowledge of an individual\u2019s specialty, clinical management \nskills, inter-personal skills, leadership, team-working, decision making, presentation \nskills, and so on, the contexts in which these are used is the key to the range of \ndifferences. Those professionals whose roles are split between clinical and \nmanagerial or academic responsibilities face a particular set of issues with regard to \nCPD and the need to keep up-to-date in order to be safe to practice. Often their non-\nclinical roles left them \u201cout of the loop of a lot of practice activities that keep a very \nactive partnership up to date\u201d, as in the case of GPs for example. More effort to \nkeep on top of new therapies, for instance, had to be made, and in some instances, \ninterviewees found that since the major part of their working week was spent on \nnon-clinical activities, they could not spend sufficient time ensuring that they were \nsafe to practice, and therefore they decided to opt out of their respective clinical \nroles altogether. Others found ways of managing this problem. Like the kidney \ntransplant surgeon example, given in the paragraph above\n3. A few interviewees \nexplained that going to conferences and targeting specific parts of the programme \nprovided a workable solution to their problem, by enabling them to i) refresh their \nclinical knowledge; ii) discover what was new in both clinical knowledge and in \nclinical management; and iii) become updated quickly and efficaciously in terms of \nthe time taken. \n \nDistribution of CPD across institutional and more personal settings \nInstitutional: Local versus national provision \nIn the context of national provision, one questionnaire respondent\u2019s reply that, since \nhe was based in Scotland, he \u201coften had problems accessing courses because of the \ndistance from North Scotland and the travel time needed\u201d. This comment was \nsimilar to those made by other respondents and also by those consultants who lived \nand worked in Scotland and took part in telephone interviews. Other questionnaire \nrespondents indicated that the situation was much worse for clinicians who worked \npart-time and this point was also picked up in the interviews conducted. But the \nproblem is not just limited to Scotland. Many interviewees working in the North of \nEngland also expressed their views that meetings in London were very expensive \nboth in terms of finance and of time. Indeed, meetings are so \u201cLondoncentric\u201d and \nthis should be addressed, said one consultant, via allocating financial resources for \nthe North and Scotland and through the provision of online \u201ce-packages\u201d. Part-time \nclinicians who were interviewed tended to have difficulties accessing national \ncourses if they lived outside of the Home Counties. \n \nLocal provision was identified as relevant by 80% of questionnaire respondents \nalthough no individual commented on its significance in response to open questions. \nA number of female interviewees explained that they deliberately selected locally \nprovided CPD activities while their children were young as it was a question of life-\nbalance choices. \n \nTime and travel distance were not the only difficulties with regard to accessing \nnationally provided CPD activities inasmuch as several interviewees pointed out \n                                                 \n3 There is a core of practice-based clinical knowledge, psychomotor skills and management to \nsurgery and thus keeping up to date with a specialist area (kidney transplants) and with general \nsurgery is quite different to somebody who is attempting to keep up to date in clinical practice while \nspending half a week doing a desk job, even if that does entail being involved in medical education, \nmanagement of others, assessment procedures and so on. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 38 \nthat notification of CPD activities and events was not always sufficiently in advance \nin order for busy professionals to be able fit them into their diaries. \n \nExternal versus internal CPD activities \n89% of questionnaire respondents referred to the importance of conference \nattendance and one hundred and sixty-one respondents wrote additional comments \nin support of its value. A small sample of these comments has been included here in \norder to give a flavour of the breadth and multiplicity of what counts as CPD for a \nprofessional at any one point in time and in their career and the activities that attract \nprofessionals to attend. These included such factors as \u201cup-to-date common \npractice\u201d, \u201cspecialist approaches\u201d, \u201ctechnical teaching\u201d, \u201ccareer discussions and \npeer discussions\u201d (Vascular Society Annual Meeting); \u201chigh quality learning and \nlectures for Emergency Medicine not available locally\u201d (ACEP); \u201cinteraction \nbetween senior and junior doctors, paramedical staff, patients\u201d; \u201cexperience was \nshared whether you were in the lecture theatre, looking at the exhibits, eating\u201d; and \n\u201cit was HIV in the eyes of the Scientist, Clinicians in rich and resource poor \ncountries, nurses, patients, the HIV Association who talk the language which the \npatient understands\u201d (The British HIV Association in Edinburgh, April 2007). \nEven a short list like this shows the scope as well as the diversity that is to be found \nin Medicine and medical practice and thus the sheer complexity that CPD has to \naddress in terms of provision, resources and assessment. \n \nMore personal settings \nThe settings in which individuals carry out their particular professional roles vary \nquite significantly, but for the purposes of this discussion, a broad distinction \nbetween clinical and non-clinical contexts\n4 is sufficient. Taking the clinical contexts \nfirst, there were teaching and non-teaching hospitals; small and large departments; \ndepartments whose staff not only expressed their interest in education but put that \ninterest into action somehow and departments that didn\u2019t do this; Trusts who were \nmore supportive of CPD and those who were less supportive. Settings within non-\nclinical contexts would include the many different roles undertaken for the \nColleges, Faculties, Deaneries, Universities, Medical Schools, the Royal Society of \nMedicine and so on.  \n \nLarge departments were better able to facilitate more interactions between clinicians \nas well as between clinicians and other healthcare professionals simply because \nincreased numbers of personnel within a particular location will affect the \nprobability of interactions. Conversely small departments were not able to provide \nsuch opportunities and there was more difficulty in attending external events. \nMoreover, if one or two individuals did not get along this was likely to be more \nnoticeable within a small department. The changing staffing levels may lead to \nfurther reductions in learning opportunities\n5. If the department was understaffed \nrather than small then further reduced learning opportunities were much more \nlikely. If staffing levels were maintained through potential changes in employment \n                                                 \n4 These contextual categories named in this chapter are discursive ones created for rhetorical \npurposes in order to contribute to the debate; they are sufficiently representative of the real to be a \nuseful model but are not being presented as an exact portrayal of what goes on in the real world of \nmedicine. \n5 This may be exacerbated by the increase in SpRs with CCST who will be given more clinically \nbased sessions at the expense of SPAs from 2012 onwards. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 39 \npractice, then it\u2019s also likely that learning opportunities will also be adversely \naffected in the potential reduction in non-clinical sessions (SPAs) for individuals, \nthereby reducing motivation. \n \nTurning to the educationally active departments, these were the places where the \ninterests, motivation, numbers of committed people around will be more conducive \nto positive attitudes and values towards learning. What looked routine work to \nsome, became an ad hoc learning opportunity for these others because they saw \nthings with different eyes. The departmental size was no bar to being educationally \nactive, rather it was motivation that was important. For example, one GP \ncommented that in his two-person practice, he found medical students \u201chelpful\u201d \nbecause they made \u201cyou think about what you are doing\u201d. After twenty-five years \nof practice, with \u201cnobody looking over my shoulder\u201d, he explained, he just tended \nto get on with it, but the presence of the students created a real educational \nopportunity. 80% of questionnaire respondents experienced teaching as CPD during \nthe previous 12 months. The GP and other interviewees also commented that junior \ndoctors often provided learning opportunities simply because they were \u201cmore up-\nto-date with basic sciences\u201d. However, it may well have been the case that bigger \ndepartments were a more prominent feature of this category simply because an \nincreased number of staff made it more likely that people interested in educational \nopportunities would interact together with educationally positive spin-offs.  \n \nThe experience of sorting out a clinical problem \u201cthere and then\u201d was a \u201cmuch \nbetter learning exercise\u201d than going to a meeting where you hope you might get \nsome information that may be useful to you later. But does this learning influence \nclinical practice? That is \u201ca very difficult one to measure\u201d, commented one \ninterviewee. He continued, \u201cI\u2019ve got this clinical problem today, what am I going to \ndo about it? That\u2019s the least measurable because there is no way that external \nvalidation of that process of learning can be established, whereas a meeting is \nrelatively easy. You can say, well, at least the objectives of the meeting were \nsatisfied and you can ask the participants whether they felt the objectives were \nsatisfied. You cannot do that when you are trying to learn on an individual case and \nyet that\u2019s the most valuable type of CPD and the one that\u2019s most likely to influence \nclinical practice and to influence how you treat a patient.\u201d \n \nThis formal\/informal CPD split was articulated by one interviewee as follows: \n\u201cthere is that element of CPD which you have to sort of just do for formal \nmechanisms to get through and to tick boxes essentially. And then there\u2019s the CPD \nwhich is ongoing within your normal daily working practice, about just developing \nyour own skills, developing your own clinical practice, developing the service, all of \nwhich involve you acquiring new skills and things like that\u201d. In other words, \u201cCPD \nitself isn\u2019t a driver it\u2019s just a, it\u2019s just recorded as a side-effect for what we\u2019re \nnormally doing\u201d. Professionals engage in activities that keep them fit to practice \n(i.e., CPD activities) and these activities vary enormously depending upon \nexperience, roles, expertise, and as such they tend to defy being captured for \nassessment purposes. They are \u201cqualitative\u201d rather than \u201cquantitative\u201d as one \ninterviewee commented, soft rather than hard and thus invariably but erroneously \nperceived as resistant to robust and rigorous assessment since \u201cit would be difficult \nto police\u201d and \u201cto really quantify\u201d. After all \u201chow do you know that a chat that \nwe\u2019re having in City X is actually a good quality chat or whether we\u2019re just Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 40 \nperpetuating some bad practice?\u201d Of course the mechanisms set up to quantify are \nsimply not appropriate to assessing the qualitative but that is not to say that no \nrobust and rigorous assessment mechanisms exist to do that. \u201cOne of the problems \nis\u201d, said another interviewee, \u201cif the scientific frame, within which you are working, \ncounts and puts great value on numerical things, then in fact you will go looking for \nnumerical solutions and you won\u2019t worry very much about the history behind the \nnumber, providing the number is what was called robust and be robust for all sorts \nof reasons and none of them to do with validity, or real validity\u201d. \n \nAs far as questionnaire respondents were concerned, the notion that more personal \nsettings i) became recognised as valid vehicles of CPD activities and ii) became \nsignificantly higher on the institutional agenda for the assessment of CPD, was \nstrongly supported. Notably they cited \u201cexperience\u201d, \u201cproblem solving\u201d and \n\u201ctalking to colleagues\u201d. Work based learning, such as \u201cdiscussing difficult cases \nwith colleagues\u201d, \u201cdiscussing operative techniques and watching other colleagues \nin action\u201d, also gained a significant mention. The critical element affecting validity \nhere is discussion between colleagues where multiple viewpoints can be focused \nupon an issue or a case. The topics for such discussion can be wide-ranging. \n \nWhat to some is \u201croutine activity\u201d to others can be \u201ca CPD experience, such as \nattending a coroner\u2019s court or attending a Mental Health Act Tribunal\u201d, and \n\u201cinvolvement in local service provision can also be quite effective CPD when one \nlearns the views of managers, users and carers\u201d. A significant number of \nquestionnaire respondents (89%) indicated support for the contribution of reading \nsince, as one individual respondent so clearly stated, \u201cthe ability to sit and read \nwithout distractions of clinical commitment and to reinforce this with discussion at \ntaught courses gives me the most valuable learning experience\u201d and furthermore, \u201cI \nundertake reading in my own time as I then have control of how I learn rather than \nit being dictated by an external body\u201d. All of these examples are recognised and \naccepted learning opportunities, and, as such, they are thus potentially capable of \nbeing referred to as a CPD activity. What is more is that, given that the medical \nprofession historically followed the apprenticeship model, although \ncontemporaneously it relies less on this model for training, it seems illogical that \nthese sorts of activities are not rated higher in the assessment stakes than those of \nconference or workshop attendance. \n \nWhat counts as CPD? \nIs the purpose of CPD \u201cto make sure that people meet a minimum standard or is it \nto allow them a tool to develop particular interests to a greater degree? So are we \nlooking for a kind of everybody at the same level of minimum, just about cope-able \nor are we looking to help people get better in certain areas?\u201d This is the comment \none interviewee made during an interview. The notion of associating CPD with \nminimum standards links it to the validation process whereby a doctor is designated \nfit to practise. However, this does not accommodate promotion of life-long learning. \n\u201cJust about cope-able \u2026\u201d is associated here with being \u201cgood enough\u201d. But this is \nnot a suitable attribute for the practice of a profession. The phrase \u201chelp people to \nget better in certain areas\u201d could imply a remedial approach where it is judged that \na gap exists which needs to be filled. However, if it is intended that CPD provides a \nway in which individuals can specialise in the areas that most interest them in order Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 41 \nto become an expert in that specialised area then getting better at being able to cope \nin areas outside that specialism is arguably an appropriate aim. \n \nOther interviewees came up with further complicating issues in the course of their \ninterviews. It was described as \u201can individual activity\u201d or \u201csomething you do\u201d with \nothers such as networking, peer review and so on. \u201cNo two people are the same, no \ntwo people have the same experiences, but you can use group settings to actually \nnetwork\u201d; continued another interviewee. \u201cI think networking is an important part \nof CPD and reflection\u201d and group settings are important in facilitating that. \nNetworking and peer review\n6, for example, were seen as setting up environments to \nencourage dialogue, thoughts and ideas flow between individuals, all of which \ncontribute to and feed into reflection, learning and development. \n \nHowever, what counts as CPD to those involved in quality assurance inevitably \ndepends upon what is identifiable and claimable as CPD. \u201cYou have got to have the \nevidence to show you are continuing [to develop]\u201d, said one interviewee. But \ninterviewees did not always consider the identifiable and claimable as effective. \nDisparity between some of the things that could or could not be claimed was one \ntheme that interviewees often referred to. Reflection was a case in point. Thus, as \nthe interview schedule progressed, it became clear that the Royal College concerned \ndid permit the use of reflective notes on these activities that, according to these \nparticular few interviewees, supposedly were not claimable as CPD. The \ndiscrepancy arose because these particular interviewees were reluctant to spend \ntime writing reflective notes and, instead, preferred to \u201cjust tick a number for \nturning up to sessions\u201d, while implicating that it was not an acceptable CPD \nactivity for their College. It may also be a response to the auditing exercises by \nCPD Leads. For example, one CPD Lead in an e-mail response explained that their \nown institution conducts an annual audit of CPD activity by selecting \u201c5% of \nparticipants (in practice often 6% are needed) and requesting them to submit the \nfollowing documentation\u201d: \n \n\u2022  \u201ca completed record of Continuing Professional Development Activities. A \ncompleted diary on the online CPD database is acceptable in place of the \nhard copy of Record of CPD Activities\u201d; \n\u2022  \u201ca completed Professional Development Plan for a given year (College of \nDepartment of Health format). The PDP must be signed\u201d; \n\u2022  \u201cevidence of all external CPD activity. Evidence of 25 external CPD points \nwill be considered as the minimum acceptable total\u201d; \n\u2022  \u201cevidence of internal CPD activity. Evidence of internal CPD points to make \nup a total score of 50 points (i.e., internal CPD points plus external CPD \npoints)\u201d. \n \nThe institutional nature of the discourse in this excerpt from the email response is in \nstark contrast to the language used by the interviewees in the examples given above. \nThere can be no mistaking the regulative terminology used: it is precise as well as \nbeing concise; and its overall tone is instructional and directive. It is typical of the \n                                                 \n6 Peer activities are highly regarded in the assessment procedures of the Royal College of \nPsychiatrists, for example: see later in this chapter. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 42 \nstyle that was employed by other CPD Lead respondents (see the email letter to \nCPD Leads in Appendix C). \n \nInterestingly, one CPD Lead commented that self-reflection does not qualify on its \nown as some clinicians will simply choose to partake of CPD activities that are \nconfined to their own particular comfort zones. A self-critical attitude, however, in \nconjunction with self-reflection will provide the self-realisation, the motivation and \nthe ability to act differently and try a CPD activity outside of the comfort zone. This \ncomment may account for the 18% of questionnaire respondents who were \nmandated to attend CPD or the 5% who attended as a requirement of a performance \nreview. \n \nIn this context, one interviewee, talking about CPD and work-based learning \nexplained, \u201cI guess CPD has become a label and something that you get boxes \nticked and certificates for, so, under that formal title of CPD session, [then], it\u2019s \nthat\u201d, but as continuous professional development with small letters rather than \ncapitals, then, of course it\u2019s essentially \u201con the job training\u201d. In other words, when \nused \u201cwith its capital letters, it\u2019s become known as the stuff that goes in your \nportfolio but, with small letters, any learning is CPD\u201d. It could even be said that he \ncould have been articulating the contrast between the quality assurance discourse \nused by the institutions and that of the clinicians arguing the case for more \npersonalised settings in relation to CPD assessment procedures. \n \nHow workplace learning outcomes may be seen as more effective \nLearning in the workplace is complex and doesn\u2019t lend itself to an accountability \nsystem of overt markers such as attendance at conferences, or reading a minimum \nnumber of books. It is hard to describe and thus does not sit well with quantitative \napproaches. Many interviewees and questionnaire respondents expressed a desire to \nget away from the \u201ctick-box\u201d approach, to go beyond the notion of \u201cscoring \npoints\u201d and escape gross generalisations; they wanted to get away from a \n\u201creductionist\u201d approach towards something that can reflect \u201cthe complexity of \npractice\u201d. There was a perceived danger that the tick-box method evoked a feeling \nof \u201cbeing regulated\u201d and that this in turn fostered an autopilot response to attain the \n\u201ccredit rating\u201d rather than a reflective learning experience that led to a deeper and \nmore enriched understanding of practice. The willingness to change from an \nexercise that involved \u201cdoing lots of paperwork and ticking boxes for the process of \nauditing, rather than getting the advantage of the education\u201d certainly existed. But, \nas one consultant said, \u201cIf you were to ask patients what they wanted from their \ndoctor, they would answer, \u2018I want them to talk to me, to listen to me and to be \ncaring\u2019\u201d. The difficulty arises with the question of how these attitudes, values and \nqualities can be assessed and recorded: CPD points being related to \u201cquality\u201d and \nnot to \u201ctime\u201d and\/or \u201cduration\u201d. \n \nIt is clear from what people say they do and how they say they do it, and from \nshadowing them doing it, that learning takes place in clinical settings and often \nleads to professional development. That it happens therefore is not the issue. The \npoint is the way in which this occurrence is recorded and assessed by an externally \napplied robust set of procedures. If a group of consultants are \u201cchatting\u201d about \ncases, can the quality of this be judged \u201ca good quality chat\u201d or an act of \u201cjust \nperpetuating some bad practice\u201d? One way of finding out is through shadowing, Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 43 \nwhere the parties typically engage in an intimate dialogue, born of enquiring into \nthe minutiae of daily practice. The following example taken from an email \ncorrespondence that ensued after the researcher had shadowed a post-take ward \nround in a busy urban DGH provides an illustration of this: \n \nContext: the consultant has designed a Post-take ward round assessment form \nwhich he and all his team use. The researcher (R) and the consultant (C) \nengage in an email conversation about what the phrase \u201cworking up\u201d means:  \n \nR: For the purposes of my analysis there are two levels of process to consider \nhere: a) the general over-arching structural and b) the particulars\/in-depth. \nThe structural one ensures coverage, giving coherence and integrity to the \npost-take ward round event while the particulars\/in-depth one provides \nilluminating insights into ways of seeing, doing and thinking that, when \ncombined, contribute to render the paper assessment exercise realistic \u2013 the \npaper record comes alive, in other words. \n \nC: Yes this is a good insight. Perhaps I need to make it more overt to the \nJuniors what is going on in my head as I listen. This is not a ritual rosary \nprocess. The Junior tells me the \u201cHeadlines\u201d and then should tell me a \nsynthesised story. I listen out for patterns and in particular things that don\u2019t \nfit. Thus I suppose in a way I sit as the \u201cJudge\u201d hearing the accusation and \nthe evidence. \nExcerpt from email correspondence: 2008 \n \nAs can be seen from the above illustration, shadowing led to feedback that \ndeveloped into a process of taking an in-depth look at the complexities of clinical \npractices in terms of its micro- and macro-politics, its nuances of how people relate \nto each other, whoever they may be and whatever role they have in the particular \nclinical scenario under observation at any one time, and in setting that alongside an \nindividual\u2019s understanding and experiences of CPD opportunities and assessment. \nAs one interviewee explained, \u201cdoctors are quite prepared to talk to a researcher\u201d. \nAs with many professionals, they like to explore their thinking and actions with \nanother person in the resulting emergent conversations. As Jerome Groopman \nwrites, citing Judith Hall who researches medical communication, \u201cmost of what \ndoctors do is talk,\u201d and \u201cthe communication piece is not separable from doing \nquality medicine\u201d (Groopman; 2007: 20).  \n \nThis notion of an intimate dialogue that engenders modalities of critical and \nreflective thinking raises an interesting issue about the extent to which work-based \nlearning is supported and its outcome validated other than by internal mechanisms, \nsuch as the statement, \u201cI now understand this\u201d. Boud & Hawke (2005:3) write that \n\u201cwe must focus on assessment practices, not just those that involve formal \nassessment activities, but all those elements of a program that require learners to \nform judgements about their own learning\u201d when discussing the infrastructures \n(both in terms of macro- or micro-level) for the provision and support of lifelong \nlearning. In other words, this \u201ctakes us far beyond the normal assessment agenda\u201d \n(Boud & Hawke: 3) that demands a more sophisticated, sensitive and complex set \nof instruments than are currently available. \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 44 \nNoticing educational opportunities involves communication. Groopman, again \nciting Judith Hall, writes: \u201cCompetency is not separable from communication \nskills\u201d (Groopman; 2007: 20). This was graphically illustrated by one consultant \nwhose clinical work frequently involves lung cancer. \u201cMedicine\u201d, she says, \u201cis not \njust all about physiological changes and pharmacological management\u201d. The \ninterviewee continued to explain further, saying, with regard to lung cancer, for \nexample, she necessarily engages in a sort of \u201cmental chess\u201d that is both awful and \nyet most rewarding. Usually, she explained, she has only known the patient for two \nweeks and yet she must inform the patient that a) there is little if anything that can \nbe done; b) life expectancy is a year; and c) most die within months. How may CPD \naddress such difficult and sensitive issues given that \u201cin addition to words spoken \nand heard, there is nonverbal communication, his attention to the body language of \nhis patient as well as his own body language \u2013 his expressions, his posture, his \ngestures\u201d (Groopman; 2007: 17). Indeed, how a doctor thinks can be \u201cfirst \ndiscerned by how he speaks and how he listens\u201d (Groopman; 2007: 17). Aware of \nthese complexities of medical communication and of clinical practice, the \nconsultant interviewee explained that on ward rounds, in acute duties, she \u201chopes I \nteach through instruction and partly by example\u201d. \n \nThere are other contexts too where communication skills, and a use of language and \nan ability to relate to another person are just as crucial. Thus, as one interviewee \nexplained, there are \u201ceasy bits\u201d to monitoring CPD achieved \u2013 can \u201cthey stick a \nplastic tube down somebody\u2019s windpipe? That is easy to describe and easy to \nmeasure. But can they communicate with small children and know when it\u2019s \nappropriate to speak to the child rather than the parent, that is much less easy to \nput on paper\u201d. In yet another context, several interviewees made a point that having \nexperienced being seriously ill themselves, they had become very aware of how \nimportant language, communication skills and relating to the patient and to family \nmembers all were . Having experienced first-hand \u201chow vulnerable you feel in a \nhospital bed, and somebody is going to do something to you and you\u2019re not in \ncontrol of it, that\u2019s all very frightening\u201d but \u201cyou can have positive spins offs from \nit\u201d and so \u201cyou can say to patients, \u2018I know how you feel\u2019 and things\u201d. Moreover, \nthese particular interviewees emphasised that not only does this learning experience \napply to relating to patients, but, such was the impact of learning from their \npotentially life-threatening illnesses, that they have made an effort to incorporate \nthis into their own practices in such a way that not only does the patient and the \npatient\u2019s family benefit but also their trainees see and understand this aspect is a \nvital part of their clinical professionalism \u201cbecause you\u2019ve no idea what it means to \nknow that the person looking after you understands\u201d. Again, generating personal \nCPD learning after a personal life threatening experience is hardly a realistic \nstrategy for everyday purposes. How such empathetic learning can realistically take \nplace is a key question for CPD. \n \nIn general terms, then, the kind of knowledge being sought is multifaceted and as \none consultant summarised it, it is \u201cvery much the art of history-taking, the art of \ncoming to a diagnosis, the art of looking at other diagnoses, the art of being able to \ninvestigate patients, whether it\u2019s social investigations, or clinical investigation, \nsuch as ECG, brain scan, and that sort of thing\u201d. Another interviewee talked about \n\u201chow knowledge and skill does not come from just books and lectures, even \ninteractive sort of teaching [but] \u201cit comes from making them well-rounded, and I Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 45 \nwould want to be well-rounded myself. It is the clinical acumen and the clinical \njudgement [which] involves their leadership and managerial skills as well.\u201d \n \nWhat counts as effective CPD?  \n \u201cTo be effective we should know the why as well as the how\u201d, said one consultant \nduring the course of the recorded interview. Another interviewee commented, \u201cI \nthink the best CPD is when it happens on, you can actually put it in the workplace \nand you can say \u2018yes this is what I\u2019m doing and this is what I\u2019m going to do and I \nknow this experience will be easily transferable from now to tomorrow\u2019.\u201d In general \nterms, effectiveness involves knowing how to bring about some intended outcomes. \nPerhaps more specifically it can be said that effective CPD entails both learning and \nbeing fit to practice. However this is a learning process that goes beyond \u201cgaining \nnew knowledge, gaining new experience\u201d because in the words of one consultant \n\u201cthe heart of it is to do with the broadening of the ability to think and to gain from \nexpertise in other areas and to learn new concepts and ideas\u201d. \n \nThe question then is whether current CPD strategies and practices are appropriate to \nmeet learning needs effectively. CPD has to be more than \u201ca set of lists of \nactivities\u201d for each specialty and there has to be \u201cguidance on how to get the best \nout of it\u201d, something lacking in the view of one interviewee. What would improve \neffectiveness, in this consultant\u2019s view, would be activities\/events that inform and \neducate one into \u201ccritical appraisal of the literature\u201d and that provide an overview \nof adult learning, for example, in order that one can then select the pedagogical \napproach that best suits learning needs and abilities. \n \nTo be able to determine learning needs requires that \u201cone has insight\u201d into \nindividual shortcomings and also the ability to reflect in order to come up with \npersonalised professional strategies with which to fulfil them. Although some \ninterviewees distinguished between insight and reflection, some did not. However, \nall linked insight with reflection. Insight and reflection are both competences in \ntheir own right. Is this recognised by \u201cpeople, that are inside CPD\u201d, asked one \ninterviewee. After all, \u201cit\u2019s a question of knowing that you\u2019re actually weak in \nsomething, accepting that and going and doing something about it\u201d. But in the \ncontext of CPD, the interviewee continued, \u201cI think it\u2019s all about measurement and \nwhat you\u2019re trying to measure with CPD and where does CPD fit in\u201d. Earlier in the \ninterview, the interviewee had called a distinction between what he called \n\u201cquantitative and qualitative\u201d materialities, such as actions, events and so on. In his \nopinion, assessment procedures tended to concentrate on materialities that he called \n\u201cquantitative\u201d simply because they lent themselves to being counted, to being \nmeasured, to being assessed through virtue of being discrete, defined, black and \nwhite material entities. But so much of medicine and clinical practice goes beyond \nwhat is quantifiable because \u201cit\u2019s all about qualitative things, it\u2019s not about time \nspent per se, rather it is about the gestalt of the entire learning experience.\u201d In that \nsense, \u201cit\u2019s not about quantitative because [\u2026] you can tick a box\u201d and what is \nmore, \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the challenges to go back to [since] by making it a time \nbased activity it\u2019s very much more difficult to deal with the qualitative\u201d.  \n \nAttending a course to learn new skills for a new technique is just one part of \neffectiveness. \u201cYou want to feel you\u2019ve got the skills to do it, so that\u2019s your \nopportunity to find out whether the skills that you have as a manager and specialist Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 46 \ndoing lots of injections is good enough for you to be able to do the new procedure. \nBut that\u2019s only half the story,\u201d inasmuch as the attendee also learns what equipment \nis needed, the sort of environment in which the technique can be performed, and \nwhat sort of staff would be needed as part of the team. In other words, you then \nhave \u201cto try and establish a service in the NHS\u201d and \u201cthat is more difficult. It\u2019s all \nwell and good doing training courses in something new, but there are often a lot of \nbarriers that you have to get through in order to be able to introduce a new therapy \neven within the NHS. Often, [in reality these are so insurmountable that] you carry \non doing what you have always done\u201d. Existing practice, therefore, becomes a \nconfounding variable in implementing new approaches when CPD is an individual, \nrather than a shared experience. \n \nThe complexity that effective CPD has to address was made clear in a discussion \nbetween consultants debating professionalism. It began by claiming that \nprofessionalism requires appropriate knowledge and involves making a professional \njudgement, inasmuch as it assumes an ability to carry out \u201cthat integration of lots of \ninformation to deal with uncertainty\u201d. It was considered that the \u201cability to manage \nuncertainty is definitely different as somebody progresses up the career ladder\u201d and \n\u201cthat management of uncertainty then gives flexibility to how they behave with \npatients\u201d and they \u201cdon\u2019t get obsessed with the right answer for the patient, the \nright answer for an exam\u201d. However, clinicians are individuals, and this \ngeneralisation was precisely that \u2013 a generalisation. Thus there will be individuals \nwho have progressed to consultant level but \u201cstill believe that being told what to do \nis the way forward\u201d and therefore they will go on \u201ca refresher course where they \ngo to be told\u201d. Others have \u201cgone past that level of idea around education and \ndismissed being told and actually are more interested in the \u2018just-in-time\u2019 \napproach\u201d and they will look to the internet or discussion with their peers. One \nattitude is \u201cI don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know\u201d and therefore \u201cI need a place to mop \nup some stuff\u201d and the other attitude is \u201cI need to know this\u201d. The extent to which \none of these approaches is better than the other\u201c\u2026 depends upon the nature of the \nindividual. If you are going to transfer it into action, the latter is obviously better \nbecause it\u2019s actually personalised and appropriate and within the context of their \nworking\u201d. However, \u201cif you are going to feel good about them learning, the former \nis better, because those people feel like they\u2019ve been on a good course, and they\u2019ve \nhad a good talking to\u201d. \n \nIf \u201ceveryone has different ways of learning\u201d, as another consultant interviewee said, \nthen the way in which Colleges and Faculties set standards for the most effective \nCPD is a delicate balancing act between supporting their members and producing \n\u201ca stick with which to beat\u201d them. The fact that there are multiple ways of learning, \ncontinued the interviewee, is recognised and taken into consideration inasmuch as \n\u201cminimum standards\u201d have been set. Colleges try to provide \u201cdifferent formats for \npeople to achieve CPD\u201d thus realising \u201cthat some people will find answering \nquestions or some people will find doing it in the workplace, being observed\u201d may \nbe the different ways of approaching such a balance and indicating that the Colleges \nand Faculties \u201crecognise these\u201d. \n \nIt is clear from such discussions and interviews that there is a considerable range of \nvariability in terms of people\u2019s needs and circumstances. Thus the role adopted by \nthe Colleges and Faculties to inform people formally of the programme of CPD Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 47 \nevents in advance, along with \u201cthe potential quality of it ... so that they can get a \nfeel for whether the event is likely to suit their learning style\u201d, and whether it will \nsuit \u201ctheir learning objectives\u201d was a good strategy, according to one interviewee. \nAnother strategy involves online CPD provision. However, the challenge for e-\nlearning, is that while it is very \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s interactive with the \nprogramme\u201d it is \u201cnot interactive with anybody else\u201d and, \u201ca lot of the benefits of \nCPD are interaction with people and the networking opportunities\u201d and this has \nlimited availability in online learning. As an illustration of how online learning \nmight address the needs of learners, one interviewee described in detail an online \nlearning course, using PBL, for Specialist Registrars and middle grades operating \nbetween a number of Trusts within a particular large urban region. Although most \nlearning occurred online, members of this group also met every other week barring \ncommitments. In the event of absence, that member of the course would post the \ngroup tasks online in more detail than if attending in person. \n \nWhatever strategy is adopted, of vital importance is the fact that clinical decisions \nmight need to be supported by relevant CPD because these decisions are \u201cnot \nsimply theoretical discussions\u201d. They are decisions taken that have implications, \nand that is \u201cwhy effective CPD is all about doing something relevant\u201d, something \nthat will be used in one\u2019s day-to-day practice. \n \nCulturally embedded learning challenges: scientific and medical knowledge \nshaping conceptions and conduct of interactions \nThe methods of expression, modes of articulation and the metaphors used by \nprofessionals indicate ways of seeing, doing and speaking which, in turn, impact \nupon the conceptions and the conduct of professional interactions. It is possible that \nby changing conceptions of how learning takes place it may be possible to design \nproductive new avenues for advancing doctors\u2019 learning. We conclude that the \nlanguage presently used to capture processes of learning restricts strategic \npossibilities. \n \nMetaphors of learning \nThe interviews sought to explore how learning is currently understood and how \npossible improvements to these understandings are presently conceptualised. One \nway of doing this is to examine the types of pictures painted by the words \ninterviewees used. A typical term employed was that of the gap, with the \u201cthings \nyou need to do\u201d to fill it requiring \u201can honest perusal of those areas where you\u2019ve \ngot gaps\u201d. The word \u201cgap\u201d is either explicit or implicit in such accounts.     \n \nAnother popular variant of the gap metaphor is \u201cclosing the loop on the cycle of \nidentifying your learning needs, looking at what it is you are currently doing, and \nthen going out and doing something about it\u201d. While being similar in many ways to \nthe metaphorical use of gap, its major difference is that it brings in a notion of a \ncycle: a circling movement that never ceases. However in this case, the interviewee \ntalked about \u201cclosing the loop\u201d which implied that that the circle referred to circles \nonce only and is not an ongoing process. More accurately, the reference is about \nclosing the loop. This interviewee talked about there being a variety of approaches \nto address learning needs, and \u201cthen checking that you really have learned\u201d and \nthat \u201cyou\u2019re more effective, and you can do whatever it is you need to do, either in \nclinical practice or teaching and learning, or academic practice and so on\u201d. In Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 48 \nother words, this cycle completes its one revolution. And while this is in keeping \nwith situations where specific knowledge content or a skill is lacking, a \nconsiderable proportion of CPD activities involve taking knowledge or skills further \nso the notion of a gap to be plugged is not necessarily the best representation of how \nlearning occurs through CPD activities. \n \nDevelopment may better be represented through the kinds of cycles to be found in a \nspiral, as for example in Kolb\u2019s learning cycle (1984) or Sch\u00f6n\u2019s reflective cycle \n(1983). Here it immediately becomes clear that these cycles never cease but are \ncontinuously circling spiral-like rather than looping inasmuch as the change brought \nabout by learning or by reflection leads into another cycle and so on. \n \nOther metaphors employed signal the need to strengthen knowledge as in the \nnecessity to bone up or flesh out. These are frequently mixed with business and \nmanagerial discourses where interviewees talked of becoming team players and of \nthe need to have assertion skills in the sense of building up the structures and \nprocesses necessary for the use of knowledge in the contexts of practice. Thus, it is \nnot a simple matter of algorithmically applying knowledge. Although doctors are \nscientists, they are unlike chemists who deal with interactions between substances \nin test tubes in a controlled laboratory environment; rather they deal with patients \nwho are not standard issue, do not experience illness in a controlled environment \nbut have free will, and may exercise it in unexpected ways. One way of \nconceptualising the process of applying theory and knowledge to practice is to \nemploy the metaphor of \u201ca reality filter\u201d. In other words, as theory meets practice, \nthe pure scientific gaze encounters what may be called \u201cinterruptions\u201d\n7 when faced \nwith making a clinical diagnosis and plans (both therapeutic and clinical) for the \npatient with the presenting illness in the day-to-day reality of the clinical \nconsultation. There is a need to \u201csteer a fairly cautious middle course\u201d and be able \nto balance \u201cknowing the evidence\u201d and one\u2019s \u201cown personal experience\u201d while \nrecognising that this delicate balance is difficult to achieve. This is an issue for both \nCPD and appraisal and the relationship between them. \n \nAs seen in this chapter, interviewees often associated CPD with the appraisal \nsystem. One interviewee in particular articulated this with the following recipe \nmetaphor.  \n \nTake making \u201ca beef stew\u201d for example. There is not just one recipe, there \nare a lot. Some recipes will be easier than others to follow, depending upon \none\u2019s level of expertise and experience in making beef stew. You are \nundergoing your appraisal when your appraiser tells you that \u201cyou make \nrubbish beef stew\u201d and, furthermore, that at the end of the year, you will \nreturn and together we will have \u201ca conversation\u201d about \u201cwhether you\u2019ve \nimproved your beef stew\u201d. In addition there will be some form of \n\u201cassessment\u201d, a tasting session, for example. You express your surprise \nsince you were unaware that you had this problem, but you agree to address \nit. You ask your appraiser for advice on how you might go about learning \nhow to improve your beef stew. If the appraiser is \u201cup to the job\u201d, he \n                                                 \n7 The word \u2018interruption\u2019 has been chosen as a metaphor to signify a break in the flow and \ncontinuum of the theory of science due to reality impinging upon and unsettling theory. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 49 \nsuggests reading \u201cDelia\u201d, going to see somebody do it, tasting some to get a \nsense of what is best. A picture is beginning to build as to how to go about \naddressing this poor performance in making beef stew. There are other \nplaces to go to for assistance too. You can consult various websites, your \nown specialty\u2019s, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, for example, and \nyou choose one of these schemes to best fit with your own preferred learning \nstyle. You might simply want to go and watch somebody do it, while \nsomebody else \u201cwho\u2019s up at the Asperger\u2019s end, would want to go and read \n28 recipes\u201d and \u201cthey would make a really good beef stew, but they \nwouldn\u2019t have ever spoken to anybody in the making of it, including \nprobably the butcher, because they would have ordered it off the internet\u201d. \n \nThe metaphorical story graphically illustrates the situation of a professional taken \naback by one specific performance being flagged up as something less than it \nshould be. The choice of a recipe to illustrate this was an interesting one. A recipe is \na guideline that most people will follow quite religiously without thinking. Very \nfew would feel expert enough to experiment with parts of the recipe. The outcome \nof a culinary recipe is a specific dish or a piece of food, and this dish or food is a \nmaterial thing that can be experienced with almost all senses. It is a very different \nphenomenon from knowledge content or a discrete skill. The exploration of \nmetaphors such as this recipe can thus enhance and open up thinking, dialogue and \naction about CPD activities and its assessment.  \n \nThere are some common and the contrasting elements of the different metaphors: \neach has a sense of there being a whole, whether that needs to be completed or is \nimpossible to complete because there is always new knowledge and new \ncircumstances; each has a focus upon experience and practice. One has a clear \nemphasis upon procedures - the recipe - as well as the elements that need to be \nbrought together in a subtle and experience led manner. The difficulty that each is \ntrying to address is the fulfilment of the whole, a whole that seems to resist easy \nclosure and reduction to measurable features. This is particularly the case in the \ncontext of rapid changes and the knowledge explosion.  \n \nRather than a sense of \u2018building up\u2019, other responses to the impossibility of grasping \nthe whole deliberately turn to metaphors that fragment, or break into manageable \nbits. For example, one interviewee explained how he \u201cregularly skim reads\u201d the \npertinent journals (BMJ and BJGP) and how he \u201cjust bombs the bits [he] needs\u201d, \nfeeling \u201cvery empowered, if you like, to smash and grab in what, to my mind, is an \neffective way, because I can always go back later, by research, or whatever, if I find \nI need an article to refer to more seriously\u201d. The language used here is vividly \nactive, violent even. The learner homes in on the target of a learning \u2018byte\u2019, be it \nonline or in a journal, and once it is in his sights then it is captured and held \nsecurely. The overall tone is one of incredible speed, precision, and power.  He \ncompleted his story by saying his method of skim-reading was \u201ceffective\u201d because \nhe was able to go back to an article later, if he needed to read it in more depth. \nHowever, he provided no indication of how frequently he would find himself \nreturning to read an article in more depth. This raises the question of whether CPD \nis a fragmentary style phenomenon, where there are things that one needs \u201cto brush \nup on\u201d as one consultant put it, or invest in \u201cjust-in-time learning\u201d as another said. \nBroadly, according to one interviewee, CPD activities fell into \u201ctwo camps\u201d. There Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 50 \nwas the gap-filling camp and there was the keeping up-to-date or \u201ckeeping me \nsharp\u201d camp. However, a sense of the necessity of the whole returns when people \ntry to find their bearings within an organisation, a department, a team. For example, \nnew to the post, but familiar with the roles, one individual described her approach \nas knowing \u201cwhose levers to tweak, and at what rates\u201d. Although there is a sense of \nthere being a whole structure, it is a rather mechanical structure. Hence there was \nthe implication that learning is a mechanical process, to be achieved through \ntweaking levers.  \n \nFinally, as one interviewee summarised it, the professional part and the \ndevelopment part of CPD are best represented in the CPD activities that are \navailable and in the assessment process whereby CPD is signed off as having been \ncompleted. Even though a number of interviewees perceived that \u201cthe systems in \nplace to audit performance are getting pretty good and getting quite robust\u201d, ways \nof adapting this to on-the-job learning was thought to be impossible. Implicit in the \nconcept of continuing, there was also the possibility of \u201cmoving ahead\u201d that was \nreferred to by so many interviewees a view that captured the continuous-ness \nexplicitly designated in \u2018Continuing Professional Development\u2019. However, the \ncontinuing part of CPD was the poor relation. \n \nOrganisational perspective shaping conceptions of CPD needs \nProviding external CPD activities and events is one way for the organisational \nperspective to shape CPD needs. However, if these external events are not well \nattended then that power to shape is diminished. It is therefore essential that CPD \nproviders, whoever they may be, attract an audience and offer quality, wide ranging \nbut pertinent CPD materials that will satisfy that audience and keep it returning for \nmore. The attendance of formal CPD activities and events provides a way for \norganisational factors to shape conceptions of CPD needs. This is not a simple task \nfor any provider. \n \nAs previously noted, it is not necessarily easy for consultants to attend such events. \nAn interviewee explained, it is \u201cless difficult for the big common specialities, like \nmine, than it is for the smaller-number specialities, like plastic surgeons\u201d to attend \nformal external CPD activities. Given that \u201cthere aren\u2019t enough numbers of them \n\u2026they have actually got to go for super-regional meetings, and national meetings, \nand even international meetings, to get a sufficient volume of people to do a large \npart of their CPD\u201d. General surgeons, like the interviewee, seemed to be able to \nattend a far greater variety of CPD activities provided by organisations than can \nplastic surgeons who were said to contend with far fewer CPD events simply \nbecause they constituted a very small population. Putting on CPD events will be a \ncostly venture in terms of time, finances and manpower. Recouping these expenses \nis necessary. The larger the range of activities offered and the greater the potential \naudience will provide ways of recuperation. This greater variety of content material \ncan affect the shaping capacity.  \n \nProviders of CPD are not the only organisations to take into consideration. The \nTrusts expect delivery of the NHS health service. According to those interviewed, \nsome Trusts were \u201cgenerous\u201d in allowing consultants time to pursue CPD \nactivities. At the other end of the spectrum, a very small number of interviewees \nstated that their Trusts were not interested as this detracted from time spent Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 51 \ndelivering healthcare. A balance has to be struck  \u201c\u2026 between spending the entire \ntime learning how to do things, and not actually doing anything, and always being \ntoo busy to go to go and learn anything, and weighing that balance is difficult\u201d, \nsaid a clinician. For most interviewees, however, the CPD allowance was always \ntoo small and therefore this was a limiting factor in the selection of external CPD \nevents. The questionnaire response followed a similar pattern suggesting that \navailability of study leave (54%) and work-life balance (62%) were significant \nbarriers to participation. More mundanely, cost was seen as a significant barrier to \n69% of respondents.  \n \nOne consultant declared that CPD needs to be organisationally embedded \u2013 i.e., \nsupported and resourced in terms of time, money, values, attitudes, and so on. One \ninterviewee commented \u201cI think your Trust should pay you to go to your major \nannual craft meeting at least alternate years and, perhaps rather more when you \nbecome a senior and end up running these things\u201d.  \n \nCPD assessment relies upon CPD being recordable and this factor accordingly \nshapes CPD needs. This may lead to the organisational perspective privileging those \nCPD activities that are measurable and quantifiable in order to facilitate an \nassessment procedure that will stand up as being transparent and rigorous.  All the \ncolleges and faculties have accepted that annually each professional must attain fifty \nCPD credits to be designated CPD-worthy. Yet \u201cwhat is the currency of the hour?\u201d \nasked one interviewee. Moreover, \u201cwhat is the educational currency of that hour? \nIf I go and study for that hour, what will I be doing better as a result of that?\u201d \ncontinued the interviewee. But \u201cthat isn\u2019t the question they are asking at all.\u201d One \ninterviewee speaking about the objectives behind work-based assessments \ncommented that many colleges \u201chaven\u2019t necessarily got a thinking structures\u2019 \nframework\u201d but, instead, would rather continue with the examination systems as \nthey currently stand, since these \u201care money spinners for them\u201d. Examinations are \ncertainly expensive, but also implicit in this statement is the notion that the \nqualitative, i.e., a thinking structures framework, is not in place; rather the \nexamination system that lends itself relatively easily to the quantifiable, is the \npreferred mode of assessment. \n \nAnother consultant said that the development part of Continuing Professional \nDevelopment isn\u2019t fully addressed when compared to activities and events targeted \ntowards continuing-ness and the professional part of the CPD term itself. The \nperception of this individual stemmed from the fact that a busy NHS clinician \nspends so much time on the job and therefore might be undergoing what could be \ncalled \u201con-the-job learning\u201d. As discussed previously, currently, this is difficult to \nrobustly assess. An academic clinician, on the other hand, spends less time in \nclinical settings and more time in academic settings carrying out activities that \ncount more straight-forwardly towards CPD points. Even though, as seen \npreviously, a number of interviewees perceived that \u201cthe systems in place to audit \nperformance are getting pretty good and getting quite robust\u201d, ways of adapting \nthis to on-the-job learning was still thought to be impossible. \n \nInterestingly a number of interviewees neither questioned the importance of CPD \nnor its value in their professional day-to-day activities; indeed, one interviewee \neven remarked that it was \u201ca worthy activity\u201d. But what they did question was Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 52 \nwhether or not it could be recorded \u201caccurately\u201d and \u201cusefully\u201d. Hard copies of \nrecorded CPD activities to be assessed are no longer necessary and doctors record \ntheir activities online. However, this online submission is not trouble-free. A \nnumber of interviewees expressed their difficulties in logging in to their College or \nFaculty website for various reasons, the main one cited was the perceived \nincompatibility between Trust computers and the College or Faculty website. Other \nreasons given by a range of interviewees included the frequency with which the IT \nsystem in certain Trusts was changed, thus precluding familiarity with computers; \nthe lack of user-friendliness; and for a few there were reasons of a physical nature, \nsuch as neck problems. Many more interviewees expressed their dissatisfaction with \nthe time that had to be spent on recording CPD activity. They questioned whether it \nwas \u201cuseful\u201d and \u201cjustifiable\u201d. A number found the process of recording itself \n\u201cfrustrating\u201d for several reasons. These included the restrictions of named \ncategories designated in the online CPD record; others decried the repetition \ninvolved; and several commented on the \u201carbitrariness\u201d with which points were \nscored by the individual (i.e., by themselves) for CPD activities done. It is important \nto stress at this point that during the course of the interviews, these individuals \nshowed commitment to CPD and were fully cognisant of the need to be held \naccountable, but nevertheless they were still dissatisfied with the methods of \nrecording their CPD activities. Some had decided to keep \u201ca simple log of what \n[they had] read today\u201d since it\u2019s \u201cquick and efficient\u201d, they explained, but, of \ncourse, \u201ceven that\u2019s not accurate. When you are really busy, it\u2019s not a full reflection \nof what you are continuously doing\u201d.  \n \nThere seemed to be a desire for alternative ways of recording CPD. Although many \ninterviewees expressed a wish for something different they were unable to come up \nwith any workable solutions. With regard to on-the-job learning, \u201cyou accept that \nany doctor who\u2019s in practice, any teacher, anyone else really, if you are doing the \njob, you are learning and progressing so, literally, you can just say \u2013 you don\u2019t \nimagine many doctors would go downhill, many teachers would go down hill, \nobviously, because, as you gain more experience, you are going uphill, so I think \nthat is par for the course. It doesn\u2019t need to be, I think, wasted time on\u201d. Such a \nviewpoint is definitely commonsense and pertains to being a professional, but it is \npolitically na\u00efve.  If this fails to meet the stringent demands for accountability and \ntransparency, then \u201ca one-to-one with a senior colleague\u201d and a focus upon how a \nconsultant has kept up-to-date may be a viable alternative but this needs to be \nassessed robustly. Computer models are a way forward. However, \u201cWhile you \nmight be tempted to think its accuracy would be superior,\u201d explained one \ninterviewee, \u201cif you put rubbish in, it\u2019s rubbish out and it disguises things\u201d.  \n \nOnline learning and CPD opportunities rated favourably with interviewees: there \nwas a consensus amongst those interviewed that \u201cthings like BMJ learning and \nDoctors.net learning modules \u2026have become very popular\u201d with \u201ca lot of people \nusing them\u201d. A certificate awarded at the end indicated that \u201cthe equivalent of X \nhours\u201d have been completed along with an assessment that \u201cshows that you have, \nhere and now, understood and passed a threshold mark\u201d. Once again material proof \nin the shape of a certificate is the prize as it renders this set of CPD activities visible \nand validates them. Attendance at conferences and workshops also provide \ncertificates for the same reasons. \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 53 \nThe process of curriculum mapping of conferences and workshops as organised by \nColleges and Faculties over several years was an eye-opening experience, revealing \n\u201cgaps in the clinical areas that are covered\u201d at such external CPD events. It was \ndiscovered that core competencies needed to be identified in order to ensure that \nthese were always included as part of the programme at conferences and workshops. \nThus there should be a mix of presentations on offer, from the core competencies, \nthrough those of the not so common, to those of the rather rare clinical areas. \n \nAlready we have seen already above that the word \u201cknowledge\u201d, as used by \ninterviewees, represented a raft of meanings that ranged across different contexts. \nConsider communication as an example in the context of an emergency department, \n\u201cit\u2019s not just communication, \u2026 it includes situation awareness, leadership skills, \nknowing the capabilities of everybody on the team and it\u2019s all that sort of interplay \nthat goes on when you are actually running, for example a Resus\u201d, explained one \nconsultant in Emergency Medicine. And it is this complexity that has to be \naddressed by CPD, both in terms of opportunities for development and in terms of \nassessment. In other words, the College or Faculty has to ensure that their proffered \nprogrammes of CPD activities do address these issues and they would be well \nadvised to ensure that the assessment procedures are sufficiently flexible to \naccommodate such nuanced intricacies. In the example of communication given, \nabove, the consultant commented that these \u201csorts of communication skills are often \n\u2026 best looked at [either by] somebody observing you in a resuscitation itself or in a \nsimulated environment\u201d. This type of assessment is potentially useful in that it \nguarantees a quality assurance procedure that is universally accepted and should be \nconsidered by individual colleges. However, it does have resource implications. \n \nA conception of CPD: a single scale or ideologically shaped alternative option \n\u201cLearner-led CPD is the most successful because that encourages engagement and \nacknowledges professionalism\u201d, declared one consultant interviewee. In \npedagogical terms this follows adult learning models, self as agent models, active \nlearner models\n8 and so on. The reality of CPD provision, real CPD opportunities \nand CPD assessment may not meet this aspiration. \n \nCPD was understood differently by those with organisational responsibilities to \nthose who see it through the filter of their own personal professional development. \nThe former were more centred on how organisations might make structural \nadjustments with respect to educational objectives (e.g., in response to \nrecertification). The latter were more concerned with personal investment of time \ntowards their own enhanced professional functioning for improved patient care. \nHowever, for CPD to be effective it must address the needs of individual clinicians, \nof the populations they serve, the organisations within which they work as well as \nbroader system-wide, national policies. This is a complex set of aims.  \n \nAn overarching CPD delivery strategy therefore needs to be capable of addressing \neach level of complexity rather than privileging one at the expense of another. \nBroad national policies have to be localisable (for regions and their specific sub-\nlocations) and ultimately individualised in order to meet the real demands of \n                                                 \n8 See Literature Review: Rogers, MacMurray (1991), Kolb (1984), Lewin, Guly HR EMJ 2000; 17; \nDaley BJ 1998: http:\/\/www.edst.educ.ubc.ca\/aerc\/1998\/98daley.htm  etc. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 54 \nindividual clinicians engaging with the particular circumstances of a specific \npatient. Any generalisation of the effectiveness of a particular CPD initiative in such \na multi-layered context therefore is itself complex. Complex generalisation thus \nrefers to the multiple effects of an initiative or acts as it is translated in different \nways at different levels or in different contexts of action.  \n \nAs in the discussion on the nature of CPD in the preceding section, it can be \ninterpreted in multiple ways by clinicians and can be reduced to box ticking \nactivities. As one questionnaire respondent, an ex-associate medical director who \nhad been in post for more than five years, responded: \u201cI can safely say that most \ncolleagues see many aspects of CPD as a chore to be endured. I suspect this is \nlargely because of the excessive \u201cnanny\u201d approach we have indulged in. If CPD is \nto be meaningful, then we will have to listen to our colleagues and not just adhere \nto government targets and \u2018PC\u2019 concepts\u201d. \n \nThis is a danger where general educational objectives are primarily understood in \nterms of narrowly defined delivery mechanisms centred on the acquisition by \ndoctors of new or updated medical content knowledge, particularly when such \nknowledge is seen as the core element of CPD need and practice. This results in \nCPD primarily being understood by both providers and users as a formal activity in \nwhich individuals acquire knowledge through agreed media, and that it takes place \naway from everyday professional settings. Although there are many skills-based \ncourses, it is typically knowledge rather than skills or indeed, attitudes and \nbehaviours that is acquired. However, the balance between knowledge and skills \nwill vary according to the specialty since those with a high level of psycho-motor \nactivity (e.g., gastro-intestinal surgery) will have a significant skill CPD \nrequirement whereas, for example, psychiatry may require a higher level need for \naffect. \n \nThe delivery of skills, knowledge, or indeed attitudes through the mechanism of \ncourses, conferences, workshops addresses the need for coverage across a system, \nbut it does not necessarily address the necessity for in-depth learning in the context \nof the workplace itself where individuals typically have to come to judgements \nbased upon incomplete information and knowledge. Evidence based practice is thus \nnot reducible to the manipulation of information or knowledge employing clear cut, \nsystematic formulae as say, in the decision-trees employed in the construction of \ncomputer programmes. \n \nThe Royal Colleges of Surgeons has \u201cvery prescriptive terms\u201d to cover ways in \nwhich surgeons learn practical procedures requiring high levels of psycho-motor \nskills. \u201cSo you learn [1] by watching with the consultant or the trainer talking you \nthrough each step, and then [2] you learn by watching while you talk through each \nstep before it happens, and then [3] you learn by doing with the trainer talking you \nthrough each step before it happens, and then [4] you do the procedure with the \ntrainer stepping in if there are any specific problems\u201d. Thus \u201cthere is quite a well-\ndocumented style or procedure that we follow in terms of how you learn a set \ntechnique\u201d (see, for example, Davis & Forrest, 2008). This account clearly indicates \nthe universalism of the behavioural pattern that is followed. Systematic \ngeneralisation has evidently been instigated and accepted by the surgical profession.  \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 55 \nOther interviewees articulated the learning of psycho-motor skills in slightly \ndifferent ways, although never deviating from the behavioural pattern described so \nclearly above. Step [1], according to some of these other consultant surgeons \nconsisted of two parts, namely, watch the consultant\/trainer do it, and then tell the \nconsultant\/ trainer what to do. In this way you come to \u201cknow all the background \nand you know all the basic things and you start to do it, but then you learn more \nabout, maybe, the complexities of it, or the nuances of it, once you\u2019ve actually done \nit. So it\u2019s an ongoing thing and you start to, maybe, go up a level of knowledge and \nexperience and then you get more out of a meeting, or a master class\u201d. With this \nparticular account we begin to recognise that much more than that very visible set \nof behaviours is going on and that what is underpinning the essential learning that \noccurs in this sort of apprenticeship model is actually invisible and involves an \narray of diverse activities, such as thinking and decision making (Croskerry, 2006) \nmaking \u201cflesh and blood decisions\u201d (Croskerry in Groopman, 2007), \u201crecognition-\nprimed decision making\u201d (Klein, et al. 1993), use of heuristics to handle uncertainty \n(Farmer & Higginson, 2006), metacognition and cognitive forcing strategies \n(Croskerry, 2003) to name but a few. It can be argued that the simple act of \nmimicking someone else, either by doing (robotic-like) or speaking (actor-like), \ndoes not lead to the development of surgical skills. The process is far more \ncomplicated than that. \n \nThis crucial, yet invisible, learning enables you to \u201cstart to think about the more \ndifficult cases, or more the unusual cases, rather than the straightforward, standard \nones. The basic training was useful for the bog-standard, very classic cases, but \nthen there are all these complex cases that you have a different level of \nunderstanding and questioning about as you\u2019re training on those\u201d, continued the \nconsultant surgeon. Furthermore, \u201cthere is no doubt that people learn in different \nways, and have different favourite instruments, depending upon their own \nexperience and their own degree of manual dexterity, to some extent\u201d, explained \nanother surgeon during his interview. \u201cI don\u2019t like dissecting with scissors\u201d, he \ncontinued, \u201cI find them cumbersome and clumsy, so I tend to use scalpels\u201d. Other \nsurgeons would use scissors, he said. \u201cThere is a lot of individual variation, I think, \nbut there is no doubt that, as you practice a technique, you get better at it and, what \nyou have to do is practise all the different techniques that are available and then \nchoose the one that suits you best\u201d.  \n \nThis model, explained another interviewee, is used on ATLS instructor courses. \nWatching involves looking and this contributes to \u201cI think about 60-65 per cent, or \nso, 60 per cent, just by looking \u2026 and then you do the same technique again, but \nwith a commentary, and the ears take in about 15 per cent of what\u2019s heard. So if \nyou\u2019re blind you take in 15 per cent but if you\u2019re deaf you take in 60 per cent but, if \nyou\u2019re all-seeing, that\u2019s 75 per cent, and then it\u2019s reinforced again\u201d through \nengaging in \u201cthe pyramids of how people learn, and conscious learning and \nunconscious learning, conscious appreciation, unconscious appreciation\u201d, and so \non. \n \nThe formation of judgement, the making of a decision and its skilful execution is \nessential to the definition of the professional at whatever level and in whatever \ncontext, whatever the particular circumstances. In short, expertise requires Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 56 \njudgement under conditions of incomplete knowledge and information in the \ncontext of given resources and multiple demands for decision making and action. \n \nNow consider the case for clinical academics who have to fulfil different roles \ncompared to the full-time practising NHS consultant. Inevitably this translates into \ndifferent understandings of and needs for CPD. It also translates into differences in \nterms of gaining access to the provision of CPD. For example, an academic role \ntypically involves a significant part of the working week being devoted to research, \neducational and administrative activities. The role obligations of practising NHS \nconsultants, on the other hand, will bind them to a greater proportion of clinical \nduties and thus limit their time spent on research. Accordingly, the current \nassessment procedure needs to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate full time \nclinicians and those who engage in management or academic activity.  \n \nIndeed, \u201cthe volume of work\u201d was often cited by a majority of interviewees as a real \nimpediment to collecting CPD points. There is \u201ca professional and a personal \ndevelopment\u201d element\/aspect to CPD and CPD is defined\/described\/articulated \n\u201cclinically\u201d and also in terms of professional practice. The professional aspect is \u201ca \ncontinuum\u201d that can have \u201cspikes\u201d at times but is ongoing, \u201cshaped by everything \nthat\u2019s happening all the time\u201d, explained one consultant whose post included both \nclinical and managerial roles in equal proportions. For example, she often booked \nattendance to update meetings for professional CPD, but these were \u201coften \ncancelled due to pressure of work\u201d. CPD involves not just the clinical but also \nincludes managerial and leadership elements too. She herself, she explained, likes to \nbe engaged in new things that are happening, so at times this engagement might \nlead to other things being left out. This consultant\u2019s articulation of CPD as having \nboth a professional and personal aspect to it was an interesting one. She continued \nto explain that there is a sense in which some of what she does creates a comfort \nzone, and within it everything is so routine. For example, she can do the \nbronchoscopy procedure \u201cin her sleep\u201d, and she is nervous about getting out of \nthat. New techniques are coming out for bronchoscopy and it would require \u201cmental \neffort and time which I don\u2019t have\u201d to go and learn that. Being able to perform this \nprocedure in her sleep, this consultant saw no point in updating her professional \nskills to incorporate new techniques, but from the personal perspective, she has \ndecided this aspect of CPD was not something she wished to take up for several \nreasons, two of which she gave, namely, \u201cmental effort\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d. \nCoincidentally, this particular consultant also articulated the position where the \ndivide between what is and what is not CPD, (for assessment purposes, that is), that \nmany interviewees perceived as existing. It seems to be the case that existing \nassessment procedures target only the professional elements and aspects of CPD \nand downplay the personal elements and aspects. The personal aspects and elements \nof CPD were more likely to relate to learning within the workplace and this was the \narea that many interviewees perceived to be under-represented in the CPD \nassessment procedure. \n \nA key question is: can CPD that occurs in the workplace be assessed? Work based \nelements of staff development are not widely conceptualised within the remit of \nsuch formalised CPD with its proclivity to privilege quantifiable professional \ndevelopmental opportunities. From the discussion in this chapter so far, it is evident \nthat educational work-based experiences vary substantially from department to Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 57 \ndepartment, hospital to hospital, according to staff composition, structural definition \nof professional role, institutional ethos\/support of CPD practices. As a result, \nformalised external CPD was seen to provide a levelling mechanism but not \nnecessarily the location where most learning took place. Personal study and in-\nhouse educational activity were favoured in some instances, but basic on the job \nexperience seemed to be very prominent in accounts of personal learning. In other \nwords, it was perceived by professionals as CPD from a variety of perspectives \nincluding confidence and clinical competence, but nevertheless, it was perceived by \nthese very same professionals to be barred from being assessed as CPD. \n \nWhen asked to comment on how formal CPD provision addresses learning needs, \none interviewee said, \u201cI think one of the things that probably worries a lot of people \nis that we will fail to adequately identify learning needs as CPD becomes more and \nmore industrialised. What I mean by that is that as all the Colleges try and line up \nwith re-validation the process aspects of CPD are becoming more uniform, which \nhas some advantages but it has disadvantages too, inasmuch as it may not \nadequately account for the needs of individuals pursuing CPD, so the \nindustrialisation of CPD stands the risk of failing to capture many individual\u2019s \nlearning needs\u201d. Talking in a similar frame, another interviewee commented, \u201cI \nthink the health service is very good at cascading \u2013 \u2018oh this is a new way of doing \nsuch and such\u2019 \u2013 but I think they then only send it down in one particular format, \nwhereas, if they looked at members of staff and said, \u2018well, this person learns in this \nway, and this person learns in another way, and we\u2019ll sort of get them on the right \nday of the course\u2019, as it were, but, also, sitting down and identifying those needs. If \nthey want to take CPD seriously, then it has to be tailored, not only to the needs of \nthe service, but also to the needs of the individual to actually be able to fulfil a \nbetter part in that service\u201d.  \n \nThat is not to say that there is no room to improve CPD opportunities. Given that \nCPD is continuous but attendance of conferences, courses and workshops is \nintermittent by its very nature, and, given that \u201cthe time for CPD\u201d in a job plan as a \nbusy NHS consultant is always limited, one clinician knows precisely what would \nhelp his CPD opportunities. If it could be arranged \u201cto beam out post-grad teaching \nsessions to all DGHs\u201d in the region, \u201cthat would be great\u201d, he said. This would \navoid precious time and energy being wasted on journeys to get to external events, \nand ensure that it was better spent focused on effective CPD activity. However, the \nsheer complexity and the multiplicity of contexts and situations to be addressed \nmeans that a single size approach will not be adequate. The discussion in this and \nthe previous sections suggests that several options with ideological, professional \nand contextual factors shaping the options will be required. \n \nReflection and its impact \nReflection was sometimes described by interviewees as an \u201canalysis of your \nexperience\u201d, and \u201cabout thinking things through to do better, but also being there, \nexperiencing it, doing it\u201d. Another interviewee was a little hesitant, saying, \u201con the \nreflection, again I\u2019m assuming, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that reflection means \nthinking about what I\u2019ve learned, what I\u2019ve done with it, and auditing, completing \nthe auditing process, so I\u2019m watching what I\u2019m doing, seeing if it makes a \ndifference, if it does, how can I improve it? If it doesn\u2019t should I abandon it or \nshould I try a different strategy? Is that what you mean by reflection?\u201d Here Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 58 \nreflection was linked not to being able to critique one\u2019s practice but rather to an \nauditing process. When an interviewee was asked to explain what he meant by an \naudit he described the process as comparing some facet (that chosen to be audited) \nof their own practice with some standard set by a recognized august body or \ninstitution and ensuring that his practice in the context of this particular facet \ncorresponded closely with that standard. Such a comparative practice is not the \n\u201canalysis\u201d as described above which requires \u201cthinking\u201d, \u201cbeing there\u201d, as well as \n\u201cexperiencing\u201d and \u201cdoing\u201d; it is not the \u201canalysis\u201d that signifies \u201creflection\u201d. \nAnd that becomes even more evident as this hesitant interviewee talks further, \nsaying, \u201cso, my reflection is why don\u2019t I sometimes make the changes? I sometimes \ncome to the answer that the effort isn\u2019t worth the outcome. We\u2019re too set in our \nways and we just don\u2019t have time. Some of the changes we\u2019d have to make would \ntake many hours of work, many hours of audit, and bringing patients back again \nand again to measure things, blood tests. We don\u2019t have the time. It would be \nwonderful if we had the time. We could all do a lot better for our patients if we had \nthe time.\u201d A notion of audit continues to remain the main subject of the interview \nconversation. Reflection seems a difficult concept and practice. Indeed, exploring \nthe theme of reflection, one interviewee expressed a belief that medicine as a \nprofession was \u201cpoor at recognising it and recording it and giving credit for it\u201d. \nThere were \u201cpockets around the place where reflection is built into the system\u201d, he \ncontinued, particularly in larger departments where there were more than two \nconsultants on \u201cthe shop floor\u201d and where concerted efforts were put into \nfacilitating an environment in which people were encouraged to reflect on their \npractice and strategies such as \u201clots of case-based discussion\u201d were implemented. \n \nTurning from the interview data to the questionnaire data, sixty-eight per cent of \nrespondents considered reflection to be an important motivator for engagement in \nCPD and seventeen consultants mentioned it in response to open questions. One \nwrote that \u201cthe introduction of the RCP on-line diary and the requirement to reflect \non any educational experience [combined with trying] to summarise the learning \npoints [was] not always easy [although it was] valuable when looking back\u201d. \nHowever, in practical terms, as found previously with regard to learning and CPD, a \nconsultant surgeon explained that when he was on the general surgical take, \u201cthe \nbiggest single problem is time. We are running in complete overdrive with the \nmultiplicity of targets. I mean, when I\u2019m on take we admit between 20 and 30 a day \nso, by the time we\u2019ve been there for four days, you\u2019ve got over 100 people have \nbeen through your hands. It\u2019s a big whirl; there is no time to reflect on anything.\u201d \nHe was not alone in his views. Another consultant thought reflective learning was \nthe most threatened of all the three. There is time to \u201cdo experiential learning, but \nto do proper reflection, proper blue skies stuff\u201d there is no time for that, she said. \nThat required a \u201cdifferent mind-set\u201d to the one she (and most other senior doctors \nhave) had of \u201crunning all the time\u201d.  \n \nGenerally speaking, reflection appears to be difficult as a concept and in practice:  it \ncompeted with the busy-ness of service delivery;  \u201creflection has got a bad name in \nmedicine, it\u2019s some sort of thing nurses do to inflate their profession um and the \nSch\u00f6n thing, everyone\u2019s on that band-wagon\u201d, as one interviewee commented \nduring an interview. However, it was found to be more useful by some clinicians \ncompared to others. The following two examples provide an illustration of the Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 59 \ndifferent attitudes with which two consultants viewed reflection. Each consultant \nwas interviewed and then shadowed by the researcher.  \n \nContext one: during the course of the interview with Consultant A, when asked the \nquestion: What, if anything, hindered reflection in his experience? He talked firstly \nabout how time-consuming it was and maybe if he could speak directly into a \nmobile phone and record his reflection, then his secretary would simply type it up \nfor him, having accessed it from a server, and the conversation continued as \nfollows: \n \nR: Except, of course, if somebody else transcribes it for you. I don\u2019t know about you \nbut when I write something I write it first and then I go back over and think about it \nand modify it a bit. \nC: You launder it. Yes. Yes. I know I do. \nR: No. You reflect upon it! \nC: In my time, I\u2019ve had to make lot of speeches. I\u2019ve written articles outside \nmedicine for other things and it\u2019s the same with email. Email is a terrible medium \nbecause lots of problems are caused by email, whereas, in a previous life, say, 15 \nyears ago, before we all had email, if you had a nasty letter from someone, you\u2019d do \nthe nasty reply, stick it in the drawer, pull it out the following morning and think, \nwell, do I really still feel that way? If you still feel that way, say, yes, I don\u2019t like this \nguy. He deserves all he\u2019s getting and send the letter. With email, people press the \nsend button before they\u2019ve had chance to reflect on it. That\u2019s a different sort of \nreflection. That\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about laundering, maybe reflection, but it is \nlaundering. You are sanitising your inmost thoughts in a way that creates the \nimpression that you want to give at that time, whereas the impression that you \nactually have at that time might be something different but you might not want to \nshare it with the world. \nExcerpt from interview transcript: 2008 \n \nContext two: the researcher provided email reflective feedback after shadowing a \npost-take ward round. This email feedback from the researcher led to further email \nreflective feedback from Consultant B as follows: \n \nR: The final two comments are about your ward round in particular. Firstly it is \ntime-consuming to follow this model you have set up, and you note this. Secondly, \nwhile it is obvious you are still trying to improve the model: \nI do not know when you provide these comments and to whom you provide them. Is \nit at the end of the ward round? And to everyone who is on the day shift? When do \nthe doctors fill in their Assessment forms? To whom do they give them? \n \nC: I try to give feedback on the hoof \u2013 this is easier if I remember to say \u201cI will be \nassessing you on this case\u201d. I then sit down at the end of the round, type it all up \nand email it to all team members (if any \u201cD\u201d score, I would omit that doctor\u2019s data \nfrom the whole group). Yes this takes time, but it is worth it to see the performance \nimprove and to see quality and safety improve. Looking back on my career some of \nthe biggest changes in my practices have come from a single sentence. I have to \nhope that this happens occasionally! \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 60 \nI try to get one feedback form on me a month \u2013 I should perhaps do it more often so \nthat I can train the Juniors in how to give feedback. \nExcerpt from an email correspondence after shadowing: 2008 \n \nThus it can be seen from these two extracts that one consultant believed that, for the \nmost part, reflection was \u201claundering\u201d and \u201csanitising\u201d decision making because it \nallows the doctor to think calmly and objectively without emotion. The second \nconsultant, however, saw it as means for both self-learning, (his team of junior \ndoctors use this form to provide feedback on the consultant himself), and creating a \nlearning environment for others. \n \nDifferences between specialties \nMuch of this topic has been mentioned already. However, a few issues remain that \ncan be dealt with in this small sub-section. \n \nCore knowledge and skills \nMedicine is one profession even though it is composed of a large number of \nspecialties, each of which has a number of sub-specialties and so on. There may be \na case for core knowledge and skills across the entire medical profession: as seen \npreviously, doctors do talk to one another so communication is common throughout \nmedicine. We have also seen how complex communication actually is in relation to \nmedical practice. Similarly, we have also seen that the art of history-taking (see \npage 23) is a vital part of being a clinician and this too would span all the medical \nspecialties. \n \nDifferences between specialties and the implications for CPD assessment \nAnaesthetists and \u201ca lot of surgeons [have] very clear behaviour objectives [i.e.] \nbefore you move to this phase of your training, you must be able to do this. The \nsame could be said \u201cto a certain extent [for the emergency medicine people\u201d, \nparticularly in the context of ATLS and other life support courses. For example, \u201cin \norder to be able to do this, you must be able to demonstrate either on a mannekin or \na patient, you can put a tube down, you can put a line in \u2013 very strict and clear \nthings to do\u201d. But these objectives are not appropriate for Psychiatry, for example. \nWhat is important in Psychiatry is \u201ca vast array of intellectual tying-together and \ncomplexity and understanding people\u2019s emotions and physical circumstances and \nnormal thought patterns, and so forth, and bringing that together\u201d. That is \u201cmuch \nmore difficult to mark off, or be able to demonstrate that that was something they \nwere doing\u201d. This is what has previously, in this Report, been termed the qualitative \nend of the spectrum, where much of the clinician\u2019s actual practice is non-visible, \nand thus quite different to the clearly visible practical skills of the anaesthetists, life \nsupport practitioners and surgeons, as described at the beginning of this paragraph. \nThis is not to say that anaesthetists, emergency medicine clinicians and surgeons do \nnot engage in qualitative actions, but, rather assessing the non-visible domains of \nclinical practice requires a different conceptualization, philosophy and approach to \nthe method of assessing visible practical clinical skills. \n \nSurgery was considered different to medicine. Many of the surgical consultants who \nwere interviewed thought that it was, because \u201cas surgeons, we have a fair amount \nof outcome measures already imposed on us, in practice. You know, death rates, \nsurvival rates, aspects of our surgery are measured so I suppose we have a fair Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 61 \nnumber of, I guess, work-based type measures already, already, in place\u201d. Once \nagain this is the realm of what was previously termed the quantitative.  \n \nThere were perceptions of difference based on issues other than common skills and \nknowledge. For some it was competitive. Indeed, for example, all pathology \ninterviewees declared their College was \u201cquite ahead of the game really\u201d in terms \nof assessing CPD. Furthermore, one histopathologist explained \u201cwe have regular, \nwhat we call, quality assurance tests on us as consultants, in other words slide sets \nare sent round, you look at them, you make your diagnosis, you send them in to the \ncentral organising body and are marked on that, and we do those in all disciplines \nwithin pathology as well. That\u2019s quite an onerous thing to be doing. I mean they \ncome round, there\u2019s probably about seven or eight of those tests about twice a year \nso\u201d. This difference in assessment procedure can be attributed to the practice of \nlooking at slides of anatomical material rather than interacting with patients since \nthe physical material lends itself to such test procedures in a way in which \ninteracting with patients does not. In contrast, consultant surgeons talk of mortality \nrate meetings and see those as quality assurance tests and therefore applicable to \nCPD assessment.  \n \nAnd yet there was a perception of differences in terms of gaining credit points \nwithin the sub-specialties that come under the umbrella of one particular College \nitself. One interviewee, for example, a busy NHS clinician and a member of the \nCollege in question in one sub-specialty commented about his perception of another \nsub-specialty within his College, saying that \u201cthere is a split from specialty to \nspecialty that is not equitable [since one of the sub-specialties of pathology] can \nadd up their points so easily \u2026 it\u2019s just a joke\u201d. Interviewees from this particular \nsub-specialty that was criticised, however, talked about their CPD accrediting \nsystem in very similar ways to every other interviewee whatever their specialty or \nsub-specialty. Thus they explained that they can claim CPD credit points from \nreading articles but they only do so if the article has led to a learning outcome and \ncontributed to a change in their practice, they can claim their total number of points \nfrom attending one or two specific two-week courses but they preferred to record a \nrange of CPD activities over the year. \n \nTurning now to the responses from the CPD Lead letters, the different Colleges and \nFaculties offer CPD opportunities for a generic core as well as specialty differences \nopportunities. Thus the RCGP runs courses in relation to the Substance Misuse \nUnit, and CEM lists courses in ultrasound and difficult airway management. \nRCPath do not specify CPD topics, rather they take the view that \n \nan individual\u2019s credit profile should reflect the nature of the role, e.g., those \nin a predominantly clinical role are expected to obtain the majority of credits \nin the clinical category, whereas those in a management position would have \na  different  profile  as  they  pursue  professional  activities  during,  and  in \npreparation for, the management role. \nExtract from CPD Lead response to emailed letter: Nov 2007 \n \nMeanwhile the RCP suggested a notion of CPD pathways and aim to keep their \nguidelines\/advice flexible.  \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 62 \nThe impact of recertification on CPD needs \nWithout exception, interviewees would qualify their responses to this question by \nfirst explaining the form that recertification will take is still unknown and that their \nanswers must be understood in that context. Therefore with that precondition in \nplace, overall the interviewees generally acknowledged that the process of \nrecertification would lead to shifting conceptions of CPD where quantifiable \ndimensions might come into ascendance. There was no clear consensus on whether \nthis was a good thing or not. While some saw the greater accountability as positive, \nothers felt this shift would result in a less satisfactory composition of CPD that \nwould most likely become centred on accountability rather than medical and\/ or \nprofessional need. In other words, the welcomed flexibility that currently exists by \ncareful and intentional design in the system will probably be reduced. Moreover, \nmany expressed concern that perhaps on the job elements will be acknowledged \neven less. \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 63 \nChapter 6: Conclusion \n \nWe might ask also how the doctor\u2019s capabilities might be understood through the \nfilter of revalidation where perhaps government and other stakeholders\u2019 agendas \nmay become more prominent in defining doctors\u2019 duties. Issues of professional \nrepresentation are seen as being likely to emerge as the government implements \nscrutiny through professional organisations, such as the GMC, Colleges and Health \nAuthorities. For example the role of colleges may shift from professional support \nmore to that of regulation: a result to be avoided since it contradicts the \nstrengthening of professional judgement, decision making and action through CPD. \nMore generally, the political independence of colleges is required to ensure that \nthey address the medical rather than political needs of today and those of the future. \n \nSo how do doctors get better? It would be wrong to suppose that there could be a \nsingular scale, where some models of CPD are better than others. How for example \nwould psychiatrists finally choose between medication and discursive therapies \n(chemical\/ physical adjustment to the body, cost effectiveness, long term \nimprovement)? That is patients do not get better on singular scales. Other \nstakeholders in medical practice are governed by diverse concerns. And as medical \ntreatment becomes more ideological with government targets driving assessments \nand departmental staffing compositions, criteria based on wholly medical concerns \nmay recede or need defence. An alternative question might be, how will \nprofessional collectivities, such as Colleges and Health Authorities function towards \nmaintaining and enhancing an appropriate profile within broader structural changes \nfor the various components of effective medical practice, so that the diversity of \nCPD is maintained while formal CPD is conceptualised to include and assess more \ndimensions?  \n \nRecapping, the sheer variety of ways in which interviewees responded to the \nquestion: \u201cHow do you define effective CPD for you yourself?\u201d covered a broad \nspectrum. This can be seen from the following selection of the very diverse range of \nresponses: \n\u2022  moving people on through a mixture of employing the tools of learning \nneeds analysis and personal development plans \n\u2022  of experiencing a dissemination of new concepts because text books are \ntypically five years out of date \n\u2022  \u201cgetting to know of developments within the NHS, particularly from a \nmanagerial point of view\u201d \n\u2022  it involves clinical management; learning about people management skills; \nabout knowing oneself and one\u2019s limitations and attempting to address that \n\u2022  attendance at conferences, workshops; \n\u2022  accumulation of credits \n\u2022  the giving of presentations \n\u2022  reading \n\u2022  private study \n\u2022  on-the-job learning \n\u2022  editing a journal \n\u2022  group-work \n\u2022  talking with colleagues and \u201ccorridor conversations\u201d \n\u2022  meetings Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 64 \n\u2022  ticking boxes \n\u2022  networking \n\u2022  \u201cputting yourself next to people [so that] having recognised a weakness [\u2026] \nyou\u2019ve put into place some ways of improving that\u201d \n\u2022  \u201csigning off\u201d \n\u2022  promoting evidence-based medicine \n\u2022  learning to listen to the patient \n\u2022  knowing when to talk to the patient (child) or to the parents. \n \nSuch diversity must be read as a strong indication, supported by the literature \nreview (Schostak, 2009: 72), that CPD is personal and owned by the individual. The \narray of CPD opportunities listed suggests that CPD provision is flexible and meets \npeople\u2019s needs for the most part. The assessment of CPD activities, however, is \nanother matter and deemed to be more inflexible than it could otherwise be. \n \nIs it possible to notice or develop a way of talking about workplace learning that \nmight make it more visible, more learnable and hence easier to develop practices? \nThis motivation results from professionally oriented higher degrees where there is a \nfocus on analysing practice with view to developing it, rather than on supposing that \nbits of general knowledge can be learnt and implemented. Take the example of the \ncomplexity of communication and the consultant\u2019s comment that such skills are \nbetter assessed either by being observed in the clinical area or in a simulation. \nInstances of assessment might be built upon and extended to include these more \ndifficult to record dimensions of learning.

Lifelong learning is deemed \nessential in order to keep knowledge and skills up to date\n10. Together lifelong \nlearning and keeping up to date (clinically, managerially and professionally) \nconstitute CPD. This emphasis upon \u201cthe continuous acquisition of knowledge, \nskills, and attitudes to enable competent practice\u201d\n11 is of paramount importance. \n \nBut how does Continuing Medical Education (CME) differ from CPD? CME \ninvolves \u201cupdating only clinical knowledge\u201d, whereas CPD \u201cembraces \ndeveloping and improving a broad range of skills necessary for medical \npractice\u201d\n12. CPD, according to SCOPME\n13, is unlike CME, which concerns \nitself largely with \u201cclinical specialty-based issues,\u201d CPD extends to assisting \nclinicians to: \n \n\u2022  achieve personal and professional growth \n\u2022  keep abreast of and manage clinical organisational and social changes which \naffect professional roles in general \n\u2022  widen, develop and change their own roles and responsibilities \n\u2022  acquire and refine the skills needed for new roles and responsibilities and \ncareer development \n\u2022  put individual development and learning needs into a team and \nmultiprofessional context \n(SCOPME [see footnote 18])\n \n \n                                                 \n9 Department of Health.

Preface and Executive Summary.  \nISBN 1 873436 32 7 Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 68 \nIn other words, it thus encompasses clinical, professional and managerial \naspects\n14.  \n \nOften things are defined by what they are not. If one takes this approach for CPD \nthen it must be noted that CPD is not something extra that one does to become a \nmember of a professional body; it involves more than partaking in mere formal \ntraining courses; it is not something that you have to take time out of work to \ncomplete; and, finally, it is not an activity that results in learning with no bearing \non work or career development. Furthermore, while CPD may broaden the range \nof skills, knowledge and\/or competence at a current level or even below the \ncurrent level\n (see footnote 14), it does not necessarily always lead to a move \nupwards along the career path. \n \nA number of possible definitions of CPD exist. The Academy of Medical Royal \nColleges in the UK defines CPD as \u201cA continuing process, outside formal \nundergraduate and postgraduate training, that allows individual doctors to \nmaintain and improve standards of medical practice through the development of \nknowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour. CPD should also support specific \nchanges in practice\u201d\n15. The General Medical Council (GMC) defines CPD as \u201ca \ncontinuing learning process that complements formal undergraduate and \npostgraduate education and training. CPD requires doctors to maintain and \nimprove their standards across all areas of their practice \u2026 CPD should also \nencourage and support specific changes in practice and career development\u201d\n16. \nThe Royal College of Physicians uses the following definition: \u201cCPD is the \neducative means of updating, developing and enhancing how physicians apply \nthe knowledge, skills and attitudes required in their working lives\u201d\n17. Irrespective \nof the definition adopted, SCOPME (see footnote 18) believes there are three main \nreasons for the importance of CPD. One is delivering high-quality care, another \nis effectively coping with the continual changes in clinical, technological and \nstructural contexts, while the third is that if CPD is of \u201can appropriate type\u201d \nthen it has \u201cconsiderable potential for changing clinical practice.\u201d \n \nThe key words in each of these definitions are themselves in need of defining and \nexploring in relation to what it means to be a professional: \u2018knowledge,\u2019 \u2018skills\u2019, \n\u2018attitudes\u2019, \u2018educative\u2019. Furthermore, what counts as \u2018appropriate\u2019 CPD in \nrelation to bringing about changes? And, indeed, what kinds of changes are being \nsuggested, and in whose interests? These interests may become muddied when \nplaced alongside such issues as appraisal and the revalidation of professionals. \nThus the nature and function of CPD in relation to appraisal and revalidation also \nneeds to be taken into consideration. \n \n                                                 \n14 Senate of Surgery of Great Britain and Ireland.

Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 69 \nIn April 2004 the GMC in the UK published a set of guidelines with reference to \nthe role of CPD vis-\u00e0-vis appraisal and revalidation. The recommendations were: \n \n\u2022  CPD should cover all areas of professional practice undertaken by the \nindividual doctor; \n\u2022  CPD should cover all 7 domains (see immediately below) of Good Medical \nPractice (GMC Sept 2001); \n\u2022  Organisations, e.g., the Royal Colleges, should advise on content of CPD \nand evidence of participation; \n\u2022  Organisations should be able to confirm participation; \n\u2022  The appraisal process should ensure the relevance of CPD through the \nPersonal Development Plans (PDP); \n\u2022  Doctors must record enough CPD to meet appraisal and revalidation \nrequirements; and  \n\u2022  There should be public and patient involvement in planning, standard setting \nand monitoring of CPD. \n(Starke & Wade: 715; see footnote 22)  \n \nThe GMC\u2019s \u2018Good Medical Practice\n18 categorises the seven domains as: i) good \nprofessional practice; ii) maintaining good medical practice; iii) relationships \nwith patients; iv) working with colleagues; v) teaching and training; vi) probity; \nand, vii) health. These domains form the framework around which to structure \nand evaluate learning (Starke & Wade: see footnote 22). However, any evaluation \nof learning should be differentiated from the process of assessment. To \ndistinguish between the two, it should be noted that evaluation has a wider scope \nthan assessment and can include the policy, social, organisational and workplace \ncontexts, within which particular forms and processes of assessment takes place. \nThe political implications of evaluation methodologies was drawn out by \nMacDonald (1987)\n19 who made a distinction between bureaucratic evaluation \n(carried out according to the demands of policy makers); autocratic evaluation \n(carried out by evaluation teams who pronounce an independent judgement \nregardless of the views of others); and, thirdly, democratic evaluation which \ntakes equal account of the range of views regardless of the status, power or \nauthority held by particular organisations, interested groups and individuals. The \nevaluation stance adopted is vital in terms of generating the processes, \napproaches and the subject matters of CPD that are considered appropriate by all \ninterested parties for purposes of professional development, such as keeping up \nto date with knowledge, undertaking a professional role and being re-validated \nfor professional practice.  \n \nBroadly, from the point of view of professional bodies, the areas that need to be \ncovered in the context of CPD range across management, include education and \ntraining, involve information technology, tackle audit, consider issues of \ncommunication and are concerned with team building, leadership and so on. This \nbroad scope was officially recognised and endorsed by the Academy of Medical \n                                                 \n18 General Medical Council. Good Medical Practice.

Bouch\n21  points out that it is important to \nregard CPD, appraisal and revalidation as processes that are concerned with both \ndevelopment and performance, but to different degrees. Imagine a triangle with \nCPD at the top left-hand corner scoring highly for both development and for \nperformance (represented by the two sides of a right-angled triangle), appraisal \nscores midway along the hypotenuse of the triangle, and revalidation scores the \nlowest for development, but highest for performance since it is primarily \nconcerned with fitness-to-practice.  \n         \n(Bouch: see footnote 26) \n \nCPD and high-quality care of and for patients, then, quite clearly go hand in \nhand. But the question of what is involved in CPD and how that differs from \nand\/or relates to appraisal; performance criteria; quality assurance; revalidation is \nmuch less clear and will now be addressed. \n \nWhat does CPD involve? \nThe Continuing Professional Development cycle according to Guly can be \nconfigured as follows: \n \n                                                 \n20 du Boulay C. Editorials. \u201cFrom CME to CPD: getting better at getting better. Individual learning \nportfolios may bridge the gap between learning and accountability\u201d in BMJ 2000; 320: 393-394 \n21 Bouch J. \u201cContinuing professional development for psychiatrists: CPD and training\u201d in Advances \nin Psychiatric Treatment 2006; 12: 159-161 Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 71 \n \n \n(Guly. 2000: 12-14)\n22 \n \n \nThe diagram quite clearly indicates that CPD and high-quality care of patients \nare irretrievably intertwined. CPD keeps the clinician up to date in knowledge \nand in practice and thus \u2013 theoretically at least \u2013 keeps him safe to practice and \nalso improves the quality of care delivered. It is the case, however, that new \nknowledge does not necessarily translate into a change in behaviour\n23. \nNevertheless, CPD most definitely relates to an individual\u2019s professional \ndevelopment and to the professional body\/bodies concerned and therefore, in that \ncontext, is independent of the job itself, although inevitably tied to it. Bouch \ndescribes CPD as \u201cpersonal\u201d, as being \u201cowned\u201d by the individual professional \nhim\/herself, and as \u201caspirational\u201d [see Bouch: footnote 26], and, similarly, the \nAcademy of Medical Royal Colleges [see footnote 7] acknowledges that CPD \nbelongs to the individual, and is not run by any agency. In other words, CPD is \nindividually tailored inasmuch as it relates to the professional\u2019s learning needs \nwhich must in the very nature of things be particularly individualistic, and yet \nthis individualism is sufficiently generic as to come under the umbrella of \nguidelines\/advisory statements from the GMC, Academy of Medical Royal \nColleges and the Royal Colleges themselves.  \n \n                                                 \n22 Guly HR. \u201cContinuing professional development for doctors in accident and emergency\u201d in \nEmerg Med J 2000; 17: 12-14 \n23 Lang ES, Wyer PC & Haynes RB. \u201cKnowledge translation: closing the evidence to practice gap\u201d \nin Ann Emerg Med 2007; 49 (3): 353-366. Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 72 \nDeveloping principles for CPD \nThe most important criteria for developing CPD programmes include: 1) \nflexibility [see SCOPME: footnote 18] in order that all doctors can participate and \nfor that participation to be recognised for what they do in the context of their \nprofessional practice\n24; and, 2) justification and transparency so that their \nactivities stand up to external scrutiny, in accordance with clinical governance\n25, \nrevalidation and poor performance procedures\n26. Whatever the precise working \ndefinition of CPD that is used \u2013 and we have seen quite a number of them exist - \nall stress the maintenance of and enhancement of knowledge, expertise and \ncompetence of professionals throughout their career and the background strategy \nof planning CPD with reference to the needs of the professional personally, the \nemployer, the profession and society (c.f., Madden and Mitchell. 1993 \u2013 Madden \nCA, Mitchell VA (1993) Professional Standards and Competence: a survey of \ncontinuing education for the professions. Bristol: University of Bristol \nDepartment of Continuing Education). \n \nOne of the problems of CPD is it\u2019s not just what doctors do. Were that so, that \nwould quite simply lend itself to the Royal College developing guidelines of \nappropriate activities in their relevant field of expertise with a focus on quality \nassurance through audit rather than demanding a process of data collection and \ndocumentation of evidence. It is very clear that CPD goes beyond what doctors \ndo. No single, singular or correct way of doing CPD exists. The contexts, content \nand processes chosen will depend upon the spheres of practice, learning styles \nand personal preference. Effective CPD schemes, it can be argued, thus need to \nbe flexible, and based on self-assessment in order that they can be tailored to an \nindividual\u2019s personal clinical practice. Ensuring that this self-assessment is \nrobust and transparent is an extremely important issue that must be solved. The \nAcademy of Medical Royal Colleges website [see footnote 20] suggests that \nlinking CPD and appraisal might be a way forward since appraisal concerns itself \nwith meeting agreed educational objectives.  \n \nThe Academy has agreed upon 10 principles which they believe comply with the \naims of a CPD programme outlined in the Basel Declaration of the UEMS\n27, i.e., \nto i) improve the safety and quality of medical practice; ii) to encourage lifelong \nlearning; iii) to make transparent the outcomes, processes and systems required \nfor successful implementation and iv) audit progress. The 10 principles are as \nfollows: \n \n\u2022  An individual\u2019s CPD activities should reflect and be relevant to their profile \nof professional practice and performance. This should include continuing \nprofessional development outside narrower specialty interests. \n\u2022  CPD should include activities both within and outside the employing \ninstitution, where there is one, and a balance of learning methods which \n                                                 \n24 DoH.

Participants will need to collect \nevidence to record this process, normally using a structured portfolio \ncataloguing the different activities. The portfolio will be available for \nappraisal and revalidation. \n\u2022  College\/Faculty CPD schemes should be available to all members and \nfellows, and, at reasonable cost, to non-members and non-fellows who \npractise in a relevant specialty. \n\u2022  Normally, credits given by Colleges\/Faculties for CPD should be based on \none credit equating to one hour of participation. The minimum required \nshould be an average of 50 per year. Credits for un-timed activities such as \nwriting, reading and e-learning should be justified by the participant or \nshould be agreed by College\/Faculty directors of CPD. \n\u2022  Participation in College\/Faculty based CPD schemes should be \nacknowledged by a regular statement issued to participants based on \nannually submitted returns. \n\u2022  In order to quality assure their CPD system, Colleges\/Faculties should fully \naudit participants\u2019 activities on a random basis. Such peer-based audit should \nverify that claimed activities have been undertaken and are appropriate. \nParticipants will need to collect evidence to enable this process. \n\u2022  The proportion of participants involved in a random audit each year should \nbe of a size to give confidence that it is representative and will vary \naccording to the number of participants in a given scheme. \n\u2022  Self-accreditation of accredited activities and documented reflective learning \nshould be allowed and encouraged. Formal approval of the quality of \neducational activities for CPD by Colleges\/Faculties should be achieved \nwith the minimum bureaucracy and with complete reciprocity between \nColleges\/Faculties for all approved events. \n\u2022  Self-accreditation of events will require evidence. This may be produced as \na brief reflective note. Formal CPD certificates of attendance at meetings \nwill not be required. Other evidence of attendance should be provided, as \ndetermined by each individual College\/Faculty. Signed registers are only \nnecessary where there is no other available evidence of attendance. \n\u2022  Failure when challenged to produce sufficient evidence to support claimed \ncredits will result in an individual\u2019s annual statement being endorsed \naccordingly for the year involved and the individual subsequently being \nsubject to audit annually for a defined period. Suspected falsification of \nevidence for claimed CPD activities may result in referral to the GMC\/GDC. \n(Acad Med Royal Colleges website: footnote 20) \n \nLearning is more effective when it is undertaken through activities that are active \nrather than passive and when it meets an individual\u2019s needs [Starke & Wade: \nfootnote 22]. Needs assessment activities and multiple learning activities are thus \nvital to effectiveness. A pyramidal framework for the effectiveness of CPD can \nbe constructed with participation at its base, doctor satisfaction above it, \nknowledge improvement above that, change in behaviour on the next level above \nand patient care improved at the peak of the pyramid. In any professional \neducation, generally speaking, theoretical knowledge is translated into applied \nknowledge and put into practice. CPD, of course, is at the heart of this translation \nand putting into action, but it must also recognise and accommodate for the fact \nthat effective learning requires reinforcing through a variety of follow-up Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 74 \ndevelopmental activities. Ideally these activities should be interactive in some \nway, with other colleagues in a real-time or alternatively in virtual discussion \nwith peers, to give just two examples. \n \nStarke & Wade [see footnote 22] propose that effective CPD stems from \npartnerships between doctors\/learners, CPD providers and accrediting bodies. \nThe SCOPME site [see footnote 5] would also support this proposition. \n \nAssessing & Accrediting CPD \u2013 Issues and\/or Questions \nAssessment and accreditation requires the organised collection of appropriate \nevidence plus some sort of audit of the adequacy of an individual\u2019s programme. \n \nWhile the practice of CPD looks familiar across international boundaries, \nmeasuring it, tracking it, monitoring it, accounting for it, documenting it, is \nwhere the debate about CPD lies. How can robustness and transparency across \nall cases, in every single instance, for all events, (or however one describes it), be \nensured? Does the answer lie in the use of credit points? If so, how and for what \nshould these be awarded? Perhaps one hour of educational activity equated with \none credit point is an appropriate formula to use. Of course selecting this course \nof action implies that the mere accumulation of hours of educational activity \ntranslates into better informed and safer practice. Does it? Where and what is the \nevidence? Behavioural changes and outcome measures might be more reliable \nparameters. However, how can these be measured objectively?  \n \nThe Senate of Surgery of Great Britain and Ireland (see footnote 19) and the \nwebsite of the British Association of Plastic Reconstruction and Aesthetic \nSurgeons\n28 reports on the \u201cshift away from the historical quantitative measures \nof CPD\u201d and the move towards \u201cself-accounting with quality assurance through \nthe appraisal process\u201d.  The system of accumulation of credit points has been \nreplaced with \u201ca system of allocating, approving or verifying activities with \narbitrary points\u201d. Meanwhile plans are being developed by the European Union \nof Medical Specialties for European accreditation of different systems\n29.  \n \nA huge diversity of practice exists across the specialties in medicine. Therefore it \nseems reasonable to identify those particular generic tasks that all clinicians \nwould undertake on a regular basis and which were felt to require regular \nupdating of knowledge and\/or skills. Identifying the topics or themes that CPD \nneeds to focus upon is a positive step to take since a body of evidence exists \nsuggesting that professionals are more likely to change their practice if a needs \nassessment has been conducted\n30. \n \nMonitoring such a vast array of things is clearly problematic. In order to try to \nget to grips with and contain such vastness, Starke & Wade (see footnote 22) \nsuggest making use of either \u201cevents or products\u201d, whether clinical and non-\nclinical. \n                                                 \n28 British Association of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. \nhttp:\/\/www.bapras.org.uk\/cms_cat\/76\/Continuing-Medical-Research.htm [accessed 02\/06\/07] \n29 The European Union of Medical Specialists European Accreditation Council for Continuing \nMedical Education.

Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 75 \n \nHowever, while the perspective of making use of events or products provides a \nhelpful way of dealing with and containing the vast array, it also raises other \nquestions that need to be taken into account. Thus it is imperative to take into \nconsideration the need to address i) the quality of an educational event; also, ii) \nthe educational effectiveness of the event and iii) the effectiveness of \nparticipation in CPD as a whole.  \n \nResourcing CPD: a few considerations \nCPD requires resources in a number of different ways and from a variety of \nsources. Were an existing infrastructure, such as easy access to and dialogue \nbetween the clinical director, keeper of the financial resources and the doctor, to \nbe already in place, then the process will run more smoothly and efficiently.  In \naddition, time is clearly needed to develop and nurture conversations, dialogue \nand partnerships with colleagues, and other similar activities.\n31 Networks thus \nneed to be established and developed. The provision of CPD is yet another \nimportant resource to come under scrutiny. \n \nProviders of CPD \nA list of organisations offering good quality CPD, according to the November \n2004 dossier produced by the Senate of Surgeons of England and Ireland [see \nfootnote 19] are as follows: \n \n\u2022  Surgical royal colleges \n\u2022  Specialist associations \n\u2022  Generic medical organisations e.g., the Royal Society of Medicine \n\u2022  NHS Trust training programmes \n\u2022  Management training organisations e.g., BAMM, the NHS Management \nTraining programme, business schools \n\u2022  Multi-professional trainers e.g., the Kings Fund \n\u2022  Commerce and industry \n\u2022  Universities \n(Senate of Surgeons of England & Ireland. Nov 2004: footnote 19) \n \nOnline and distance learning opportunities for CPD training also exist. \nOpportunities vary widely in both the form they take and the level of learning \nthat can be attained. Thus there are the familiar MCQs, the not-so-familiar \npodcasts that may take the form of case review (c.f., Royal College of \nPsychiatrists: CPD), as well as specific courses offered for specific \nqualifications, to name just three examples. \n \nWhere do the pharmaceutical companies fit into this scenario of being a CPD \nprovider? Given the complexities of medicine and of pharmaceutical products, \nthe doctor is equivalent to a consumer within that industry. While the doctor \nneeds to be kept up to date, s\/he must exercise sensitivity, integrity and courage \nin order to decline gifts or invitations to social events that might affect the \n                                                 \n31 NHS Education for Scotland.

Equally one should expect the pharmaceutical company to \nfollow ethical rules with regard to informing and marketing its products. \n \nStarke & Wade [see footnote 22] point out that the criteria used to approve an \nexternal event for CPD should include: \n \n\u2022  Any commercial sponsorship or interests of the programme planner, \npresenters, or facilitators must be declared on the application form \n\u2022  Any support, sponsorship or funding by commercial healthcare \norganisations must not influence the structure or content of the \neducational programme \n\u2022  The target audience falls within the remit of the Federation (recognised \nmedical specialties or generally applicable non-clinical aspects) \n\u2022  The learning objectives are specifically defined, and are appropriate for \nthe target audience \n\u2022  The teaching methods used will achieve the stated learning objectives \n\u2022  Evidence is provided that the presenters and\/or facilitators have the \nexperience to deliver the learning objectives using the methods chosen \n\u2022  The evaluation record for previous events organised by the same provider \nis satisfactory, or reasons for previous unsatisfactory ratings have been \naddressed \n\u2022  The provider agrees to provide, upon request, confirmation of physician \nparticipation any time up to 2 years after the event has taken place \n(c.f. Starke & Wade: footnote 22) \n \nRecording CPD activities: questions and issues \nSince the GMC defines CPD in terms of improving patient care then it follows \nthat effective CPD cannot but alter the doctor\u2019s behaviour in order to impact \nfavourably upon that care. The problem for determining CPD outcomes is that a \ndoctor who gains knowledge does not necessarily change his\/her behaviour. CPD \nmust then, by definition, include a gain in knowledge as well as some impact on \nperformance. Thus, whatever recording method is chosen, it needs to address \nitself to both aspects, i.e., to providing evidence of knowledge gained and of \nimproved patient care whether or not the clinician\u2019s behaviour has changed. \nPreviously we have seen that gaining knowledge does not necessarily lead to a \nchange in behaviour [see footnote 28]. One important issue to surface at this point \ntherefore is: can improvement in patient care be effectively gauged even if no \nchange has occurred in the clinician\u2019s behaviour? \n \nMoving on now to another question, how is the record to be made? Is there a role \nfor personal portfolios? Portfolios can be generic, or specific to a set of skills, \ncompetencies or area of practice. Are competency frameworks the direction to \ntake? Compiling a portfolio requires skills of recording, analysing and reflecting \non experience to inform future learning opportunities and thus either benefit from \nor contribute to CPD activity [see footnote 32]. Personal Development Plans \n(PDPs) constitute an outcome of appraisal wherein key learning objectives \u2013 \nnote: these are not learning needs - are recorded for a defined period ahead in a \nwritten document. The PDP helps the doctor with the question of \u201cWhere am I \nnow?\u201d and \u201cWhat do I want to achieve?\u201d \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 77 \nIn this context, another RCP website\n32 recommends the use of online diaries for the \neasy recording of CPD activities while allowing for print-outs for the Specialist \nRegistrars\u2019 (SpRs\u2019) training records at intervals. The argument here is that this style \nof recording has thus been established and engrained in the group that are at the \nnear-consultant stage of their careers, therefore it makes sense to use this type of \nrecord because it merges seamlessly to meet the various monitoring proceedings \nconsistent with consultant level posts. \n \nMeanwhile there are several methods by which doctors can assess their own \npractice (Starke & Wade: footnote 22). For example, they can compare their clinical \nperformance with the standards of excellence exhibited by a peer group. Or they can \ncarry out a self-audit of practice against published national guidelines. Case review \nand reflection can also result in educational outcomes. Multisource feedback \n(doctors ask for feedback from those that they regularly work with) and patient \nquestionnaires are well-established assessment tools for assessing communication \nand teamwork skills.  \n \nA more in-depth look at CPD, appraisal and revalidation will be of help here. \nTaking a deconstructing approach, the activities of the doctor can be broken \ndown into actions that identify one\u2019s developmental needs, which will then \nperform a variety of functions. Examples of these functions include, (i) either \nfeeding into information and appraisal activities, that in turn feed into a 5-year \nreview by a revalidation group or, (ii) on the other hand, feeding into a cycle of \ncollecting information from daily activities, upon which the professional reflects. \nImagine a cycle that starts with carrying out a needs analysis, whereby gaps are \nidentified in one\u2019s knowledge or skills and so on, and so a plan is devised to \nremedy the gaps, and thus learning occurs such that one keeps up to date or one\u2019s \nprofessionalism is reaffirmed at that moment in time. But that moment of time \npasses, one is no longer up-to-date and the cycle restarts and continues. What is \nclear from this breakdown is that CPD, appraisal and revalidation, while \nregarded as three distinct entities, are actually all irretrievably and complexly \nintertwined in this cycle and separating them in practice is exceedingly difficult. \n \nDoctors, alongside other healthcare professionals, are contracted to and \nemployed by Trusts to do a job; and that job is to be part of a team that delivers \nhealthcare to patients within the centres of primary and secondary care that the \nTrusts run. The appraisal process evaluates that delivery of service to patients. \nIdeally, within this appraisal system, both the doctor and the Trust are engaged in \na two-way partnership to ensure the quality of the healthcare delivered. For \nexample, the doctor needs to keep his\/her learning up to date to be safe to \npractice while the Trust needs to provide the resources, however that manifests \nitself - e.g., time off with locum cover prearranged and in place, and\/or financial \nsupport to attend courses, etc. Appraisal is therefore job-related in a way that \nCPD is not. Or is it? \n \nIn defining CPD as necessary to improving patient healthcare in April 2004 [see \nfootnotes: 21, 22], the distinctions between CPD and appraisal are clearly difficult \n                                                 \n32 Royal College of Physicians. CPD: SpRs and CPD  accessed 02\/06\/07 \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 78 \nto perceive with any high degree of clarity. Doctors undergo an annual appraisal \nand during this process learning needs are discussed in depth in order to feed into \nrevalidation. CPD and appraisal processes then both benefit from a needs \nassessment exercise. Yet in terms of CPD, that particular exercise relates to the \nprofessional\u2019s career while, in the context of appraisal, it relates to the job. Once \nagain, the process of separating CPD from appraisal and revalidation can prove \nextremely difficult. Leaving the issue of revalidation aside for the moment, both \nCPD and appraisal have elements of performance attached to them so perhaps a \nlook at performance might provide a distinguishing mark or set of marks. \n \nBoundary issues: CPD or quality assurance? \nOne important question to consider is: to what extent should CPD be separated \nfrom the particularities of organisational demands, which have more to do with \nquality assurance? CPD is rightly considered an important factor in assuring the \nquality of performance and yet, significantly, it differs from quality assurance. \nHow is quality to be defined or assessed? Is it in terms of organisational and \nmanagerial criteria or by independent professional or indeed research-based \ncriteria? The complexity of the integration of CPD can be seen in the following \nitemisation of quality assurance issues drawn from NHS Education for Scotland \n(see footnote 32).  \n \nQuality assurance issues  \nAn organisational CPD Strategy should meet the following criteria: \n \n\u2022  show how the views and priorities of service users and members of the \npublic influence the CPD activity within the organisation \n\u2022  describe systems and policies to ensure equal access to CPD \n\u2022  demonstrate how CPD will contribute to meeting local service needs \n\u2022  show how CPD activity reflects clinical governance objectives \n\u2022  define how CPD objectives meet national policy initiatives \n\u2022  set out a programme for matching education needs to service-user and \norganisational needs at local level using the model below: \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 79 \n \n \n\u2022  set on-going specific plans for ongoing CPD activities covering mandatory, \ngeneric and specialty-specific subjects. The process of defining and \ndescribing \n\u2022  standards of CPD delivery should be informed by the four principles defined \nin the Fig below: \n \n \n \n \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 80 \n\u2022  offer guidance to staff on how their CPD needs can be met in partnership \nwith managers, supervisors and others \n\u2022  demonstrate the benefits of effective working with partnership organisations \nsuch as local partnership forums and education providers \n\u2022  demonstrate how budgets and resources can be used most effectively \n(NHS Education for Scotland: footnote 32) \n \nFinally, \u201cmonitoring\u2019 [see footnote 23] of the quality of CPD ensures that the \nmethods used to develop, deliver and evaluate CPD activities are i) effective; ii) \nefficient; iii) evidence-based; and iv) economical. This adherence to the QACPD \nand Diamond Model monitors strategy, resources, delivery and outcomes of CPD \nto achieve the best possible educational opportunities. \n \nWhat are the issues\/needs that CPD should address?  \nTurning from the organisational to the individual, the coverage and range of the \nissues\/ needs that CPD should address is extremely wide as can be seen from the \nfollowing list drawn up: \n \n1.  Contextual and circumstance \n2.  Knowledge \n3.  Social \n4.  Skills and practice[s] \n5.  Professional values and identities \n6.  Decision-making \n7.  Knowledge and performance \n8.  Identifying one\u2019s own personal learning needs, seeking the means (CPD) by \nwhich to fill the gap in one\u2019s actual practice \n \nOf course, the schemata of categories devised above for the purposes of this \nliterature review is a simplistic one in order to set the stage for dealing with the \ncomplexities of CPD. This is not to suggest that the many and varied CPD \nopportunities are fragmented. In point of fact none of the categories stand alone in \nisolation from the others; rather they interact and intertwine together in a complex \nway that I will refer to as pluralism, i.e., as multiple domains of actions.  \n \nBut for the moment, returning to the simplistic schemata, the provision in this \nliterature review of a very brief introductory overview for each of the various eight \ncategories will give some clues into the underlying tensions, problems, successes, \nlearning points, failures, etc., that a clinician of any specialty constantly faces in his \nday-to-day working life. Greater insight will only be gained by reading the various \njournal articles, or books referenced in the footnotes. \n \nContextual and circumstance \nDifferences between medical specialties \nThe peculiar circumstances of the Emergency Department include lack of patient\u2019s \nmedical history, the short time-span in which to see the presenting illness evolve, \nsurges and overcrowding, trolley waits, violence and aggression, effects on teaching Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 81 \nand learning\n33 \n34, risk and error\n35, culture of blame\n36: system versus individual\n37 \n38 \nand so on. Of course, other medical specialties face their own particular brand of \nlimiting contexts and circumstances. Whatever the specialty, however, the clinician \nengages in the following generic core activities of taking a history, carrying out a \nphysical examination, requesting investigatory test, judgement calls, making \ndecisions, arriving at some sort of working diagnosis and coming up with a \ntreatment plan and\/or a discharge plan. \n \nKnowledge \nThis involves: i) adding to one\u2019s personal knowledge base; ii) affirming one\u2019s \nknowledge and\/or practice; iii) framing the medical problem given the rapidly \nchanging face of medicine today: the journal Ann Emerg Med was introduced to \nfilter\/doctor the Cochrane Collaboration because medicine has become too \nspecialised, complicated and lengthy for clinicians; iv) the nature of knowledge; \ngiven that \u201cwe live in the real-world\u201d of changeable and unpredictable situations \n[see footnote 40], in a fluid and chancy reality\n39 \n40, with limited time and too much \ninformation but not enough of the right kind, and one where waiting for a better \ndecision can be riskier than acting on hunches and inadequate information\n41; (v) \nmodels of education. For example, Fish and Coles\n42 propose a curriculum which \nthey see as emerging from the complex combination of teaching, learning and \nassessment modelled in one of three ways (note that Fish & Coles have chosen to \nconfine themselves to three models only) a \u201cproduct\u201d (i.e., object to be \ntransferred\/transmitted\/gained by passive learning, etc.), or as a \u201cprocess\u201d\n43 \n44, or as \n\u201cresearch\u201d\n45. But these are not the only models of education and there are some \nwhose learning methods are depicted and theorised around self-directed strategies. \nThese self-directed strategies include models of the CPD cycle, those of reflective \npractice\n46 \n47 \n48 and\/or action research\n49 \n50 and also Kolb\u2019s\n51 experiential learning \n                                                 \n33 Cosby KS. \u201cA Framework for Classifying Factors that contribute to errors in the Emergency \nDepartment\u201d in Ann Emerg Med Dec 2003 42 (6): 815-23 \n34 Atzema C, Bandiera G, Schull MJ, Coon CT, Section Editors and Milling, Turman J.

The results of a quick scoping exercise comparing and contrasting the \nvarious specialties illustrates this point perfectly. \n \nComparisons and contrasts between specialties \n \nPsychiatry: in this specialty, the current practice of recording of CPD is \noften based upon personal plans validated by a peer group in Psychiatry \n[see Bouch: footnote 26] - is this a model that can be taken up by other \nspecialties? Bouch certainly argues for such a move, advocating that the \npeer group mechanism elevates CPD above box-ticking and credit-\ngathering exercises. It is not unusual for peer groups to become action \nlearning sets. Furthermore, peer groups emphasise the importance both of \nbeing supportive and of receiving support from colleagues. This \nmechanism thus provides some protection against professional isolation. \n \nThe AAP (American Association of Pediatricians) has recently launched its \nPediaLink site to provide i) an Internet learning system and ii) a portal to \nits major features, namely CME, Resources and Advanced Features. \nConceptually the model of PediaLink is based on a theory of clinical \nproblem solving adapted from Donald Sch\u00f6n\u2019s cycle of learning [see \nfootnote: 40]. On a daily basis, clinicians face clinical problems, surprises \nand questions to be answered. Many of these dilemmas will be answered \nquickly by tacit knowledge. Others can be relatively quickly solved \nthrough the action of accessing information sources: a drug dose or side \n                                                 \n72 Binstadt ES, Ron M, White BA, Nadel ES, Takayesu JK, Barker TD, Stephen J & Pozner CN. \u201cA \nComprehensive Medical Simulation Education Curriculum for Emergency Medicine Residents\u201d in \nAnn Emerg Med 2007; 49 (4): 495 \n73 Hoekstra J. \u201cCredentialing, competency, and \u2018see one, do one, teach one\u2019\u201d in Ann Emerg Med \nApril 2004; 43: 475-6 \n74 Adams B. \u201cChest Radiography: the Trauma Team Point of View\u201d in Ann Emerg Med Nov 2006; \n48 (5): 637-8 \n75 Field-notes: shadowing the Basic 3-day Surgical Skills Course.

When a question stimulates thinking about how to \nanswer or how to resolve the issue, the process is referred to as \u201creflection-\nin-action\u201d. It is believed that conclusions drawn from these brief reflective \nmoments offer a broader understanding of the topic, or lay the groundwork \nfor future learning. When physicians record the questions and the clinical \n\u201cI don\u2019t knows\u201d and search later for the answers this is referred to as \n\u201creflection-on-action\u201d and may well be more stimulating and influential in \nchanging practice. As clinicians encounter further questions in their \npractice the cycle of learning repeats itself and forms an important element \nof the individual\u2019s CPD. \u201cWith this learning cycle as its foundation \nPediaLink has been developed as a system to facilitate and document the \nprocess of self-directed learning\u201d (see footnote 27). The three major \ncomponents of PediaLink are Learner Profile, Learner Plan, and Learner \nPortfolio. A specific case is presented in the article in order to illustrate \nhow the PediaLink system works.  \n \nPaediatrics: Sectish et al\n77 writes that \u201cthe current structure of CME may \nbe ineffective in altering physician performance with its distant, \ndisconnected, and teacher-centred approach to education\u201d [see footnote \n23]. Several factors play a role here: a lack of individualisation of the \nlearning opportunity; the lecture might not be relevant to the individual\u2019s \nown clinical practice; if the new knowledge is not relevant then it is more \ndifficult to incorporate it into one\u2019s own practice, and so on.  \n \nSurgery: Surgeons are advised to refer to the GMC prospectus: A License \nto Practise and Revalidation (GMC April 2003) and also to a number of \ndocuments that include Good Medical Practice (GMC Sept 2001); Good \nSurgical Practice (RCS England Nov 2002)\n78; Continuing Professional \nDevelopment (GMC April 2004) [see footnote 8]; and Criteria, Standards \nand Evidence for Revalidation \u2013 Guidance on Surgical Practice (RCS \nEngland Dec 2004) [see footnote19].  \n \nThe emphasis now is on quality and the appropriateness of CPD to one\u2019s \nown practice and career development rather than accruing a number of \ncredits or points. Its scope has been widened and it now appears relevant to \nall surgeons, including consultants, training grades, staff grades and \nassociate specialists. This particular dossier states how closely CPD and the \nseven principles outlined in Good Medical Practice (GMC Sept 2001) and \nGood Surgical Practice (RCS England Nov 2002) are interlinked. \nAlthough additionally this dossier argues for the inclusion of an additional \neighth principle, namely: \u201cLead and responsible positions\u201d within the \ndelivery of surgical care. Since \u201cthe ultimate purpose of CPD is to \ncontribute to high-quality patient care\u201d [see footnote 21] the dossier draws \nsurgeons\u2019 attention to the fact that guidance is being offered on \u201chow \ndoctors can respond to changes in society, its needs and attitudes and to \nthe complex system through which healthcare is delivered\u201d [see footnote \n                                                 \n77 Sectish TC, Floriani V, Badat MC, Perelman R & Bernstein HH. \u201cContinuous Professional \nDevelopment: Raising the Bar for Pediatricians\u201d.

London 2002. \nhttp:\/\/www.rseng.ac.uk\/services\/publications\/publications\/pdf\/gsp\/2002.pdf  Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 85 \n19]. Doctors are encouraged \u201cto explore the benefits of learning across \nprofessional disciplines and boundaries and to learn from more informal \nexperiences that are not part of the revalidation process\u201d [see footnote 19]. \n \nSurgeons are advised to devise their own CPD activities to incorporate both \ntheir own generalist and specialist needs, particularly in the context of that \nindividual\u2019s own role and future career roles. Personal Development Plans \nrequired for the annual appraisal can be made use of in the CPD context, \nlogbooks if they are appropriate, and records of CPD activities undertaken \nplus the appropriate evidence can all be collected into a portfolio, that must \nlend itself to independent scrutiny if so required. \n \nA table is presented to illustrate further the points within the dossier: \n \n \n(Senate of Surgeons of England & Ireland: footnote 19) \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 86 \nThe November 2004 dossier also stresses \u201cthe value and nature of \nreflective practice\u201d (see footnote 19) pointing out that \u201creflective learning is \nrooted in clinical and professional practice\u201d. Professional education, it \nshould be emphatically noted, is \u201clearning through practice. Surgeons \nshould constantly review their practice, discussing it with surgical \ncolleagues and members of the multi-professional team\u201d [see footnote 19]. \n \nGeneral Practice: website\n79, accessed when listed last updated April 2006, \nreports that GPs ceased to receive financial support via the Postgraduate \nEducational Allowance (PGCA) in April 2004. These payments have been \n\u201cmapped onto the global payments received by all GP practices. PGEA \narrangements have been replaced by a more formal system of annual \nappraisal and Personal Development Plans (PDPs)\u201d [see footnote 23]. \nThe GMC contract for GPs makes participation in appraisal mandatory. \nThe PCOs both recognise and are contractually bound to provide protected \ndevelopment for GPs to focus on their learning needs, even down to \nfunding locum cover if this is necessary. The model for the BMA contract \nfor salaried GPs stipulates at least four hours per week on an annualised \nbasis. Postgraduate Deaneries liaise with PCTs to provide robust \neducational opportunities. This particular website aimed at GPs defines \nCPD as, according to the GMC, \u201can on-going learning process that \nenables doctors to demonstrate that they are maintaining their skills in \ntheir practice, while helping them to develop professionally and to learn \nfrom more informal experiences that are not part of licensing processes\u201d \n[see footnote 23]. \n \nThe RCGP provides CPD support through courses and conferences at \nnational, regional and local level and also in partnership with other \ninstitutions, such as the University of Bath in the form of the RCGP \nLearning Unit, for example. RCGP Scotland has developed an online \nlearning tool for UK GPs called PEP Ekit. There is a RCGP Leadership \nprogramme and a RCGP Substance Misuse Unit. \n \nOther provisions included in this particular website are BMJ learning \npackages for online learning, Patient Safety E-Learning tool, and Risk \nAssessment Tools. \n \nNon-members of Colleges: Lloyd-Williams et al\n80 report on a survey of all \ndoctors in palliative medicine undertaken to investigate whether doctors \nhad fulfilled their CPD requirements for 2001-2002 and to identify \nproblems or difficulties experienced by doctors in undertaking CPD. A \nlarge proportion of the palliative medicine workforce comprises part-time \nposts, and often these posts are non-training posts. The study found that \n64% of the respondents, all of whom were on the specialist register had \nfulfilled their CPD commitments and those least likely to do so were those \nholding a contract with a charitable organisation (33%). The study also \n                                                 \n79 The Royal College of General Practice. \nhttp:\/\/www.rcgp.org.uk\/information_services\/information_service...

Med Teacher 2006; 28: 171-174 Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 87 \nfound that less than half of the doctors not on the specialist register \nunderstood CPD and revalidation requirements. \n \nOther: e.g., Nursing and Midwifery \u2013 [see: footnote 36]:  \nThe activities that constitute CPD range from work-based and self-directed \nlearning activities to academically accredited and professionally validated \ncourses offered by higher education institutions. While there is no problem \nwith CPD being multi-disciplinary, multi-professional and multi-sectoral \nactivities the important question is how is this best addressed? The criteria \naddressed here include: building on the core skills and competencies set out \nby professional regulatory bodies; focusing on the skills, knowledge and \npractices required to deliver a quality service and on research that is \nevidence and competency based alongside being directly relevant to \nimproving health and health care for service users and for enhancing \nservice delivery.  \n \nThe above small scale scoping exercise where a few points have been highlighted \nfrom a number of various medical and non-medical specialties gives some \ninsight into the range of professional values and identities that CPD needs to \ncover. My account in this document is not intended to give a detailed in-depth \nview. \n \nHowever, were my account were to start to develop such an in-depth view, \nprofessional values and identities would be explored further especially from the \nperspective of presenting a complex set of issues\/ needs that CPD must address. For \nexample: \n \n\u2022  Teaching professionalism \u2013 Knopp\n81 argues that professionalism is centred \nupon \u201cthe attitudes and behaviors that enhance trust by placing the patient\u2019s \ninterests above other interests\u201d. But how does one go about teaching such \nethical judgements? And how does one assess that teaching? One has to \nresort to \u201cproxies such as clinical quality indicators, patient surveys and \nnational or specialty standardised measures\u201d. Knopp suggests the use of \nclinical role models.  \n\u2022  How does one teach professionalism in contexts that beg the question \u201cIs \ndoing \u2018everything\u2019 enough?\u201d and to which the response is: \u201ceven everything \nwasn\u2019t enough for our patient or for us\u201d \n82 \n \nPerhaps the following website and the article by Thomas et al\n83 go some way to \nproviding the answer \u2013 \n \n\u2022  http:\/\/www.gtce.org.uk\/research\/commissioned_res\/cpd1\/: [accessed 30 \nMay 2007] presents an article that includes an introduction to Professional \nLearning Communities and to Professional Associations Research Networks \n                                                 \n81 Knopp R. \u201cThe Challenges of Teaching Professionalism\u201d in Ann Emerg Med Nov 2006; 48 (5): \n538-9 \n82 Burg MD. \u201c\u2018Is doing everything enough?\u201d in Ann Emerg Med Aug 2004; 44: 175-6 \n83 Thomas HA, Binder LS, Chapman DM, Kramer DA, LaMantia J, Perina DG, Shayne PH, Sklar \nDP, Sorensen CJ. \u201cThe 2003 model of the clinical practice of Emergency Medicine: the 2005 \nupdate\u201d in Acad Emerg Med Oct 2006; 13: 1070-1073 Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 88 \n(PARN) indicating that online CPD learning opportunities and communities \nfor learning are out there should one want to search for them. \n \nA quick second scoping exercise of a number of Royal Colleges provides another \nperspective on the category of professional values and identities from the point of \nview of Medical Specialties as follows: \n \nExample of informing practice and knowledge transfer issues: \n\u2022  Includes \u2013 adding to one\u2019s own knowledge base; affirming one\u2019s knowledge \nand\/or practice; framing the medical problem \n\u2022  Royal College of Psychiatrists has CPD online: 2 podcasts: i) the \nmethodology of case-control studies which gives a) a knowledge of the \nmethodology of case-control studies; b) an understanding of the main \nsources of bias in case-control studies; c) an understanding of how to \nminimise selection bias in a psychiatric case-control study; d) some useful \ninformation on best practice in recruitment for case-control studies; ii) \ninsight \u2013 how is it related to mental illness which gives a) an overview of the \nassociations between insight and mental disorders; b) an understanding of \nthe relationship between levels of insight and different factors in \nschizophrenia; c) knowledge of the latest neuroimaging research findings \nwith regard to insight. \n\u2022  The Royal College of Paediatrics defines education as \u201cLearning what you \neven didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t know\u201d. Its website does not have an obvious \nplace to go to in order to get a sense of what they understand as CPD. They \nhave Training; Competency Frameworks; Education; Appraisal and so on, \nbut nothing that is listed under the remit of CPD. \n\u2022  The Royal College of General Practitioners has the following on its website \nunder the heading Professional Development: Events; Substance Misuse \nUnit; RCGP Learning Unit; Leadership Programme; RCGP Distance \nLearning; Other Distance Learning; RCGP accredited courses; and \nAccreditation for HPD Learning Unit. \n\u2022  Includes - teaching professionalism \n\u2022  And also an example of socialisation: Royal College of Surgeons of England \nadvises that each surgeon has a responsibility to maintain his\/her own \nrecords for review as part of mandatory annual appraisal at Trust level and \nthe proposed national arrangements for the 5-yearly revalidation. A \nproforma has been produced and is highly recommended. Numerical points \nor credits are no longer being awarded as part of the processes for CPD. \n\u2022  In March 2006 a Working Party chaired by Chris Chiltern took a new look \nat CPD policy for the Royal College. The Working Party met with a number \nof expert witnesses and will produce recommendations to the Council in \n2007. The impetus was the July 2006 publication of the report entitled \n\u201cGood doctors, safer patients\u201d by the Chief Medical Officer and the \nsubsequent White Paper \u201cTrust, Assurance and Safety\u201d released in February \n2007. Related documents listed on their website include: \u201cHealthcare \nprofessional regulation consultation\u201d; but more specifically: \u201cGuidance on \nSurgical \u2013 Criteria, Standards and Evidence\u201d and \u201cMaintaining Your \nPerformance \u2013 Dossier of Guidance on Continuing Professional Develop \nPracticement for Surgeons\u201d. \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 89 \nAs can be seen from the details given in this section on professional values and \nidentities, professionality includes ethical and political issues in addition to those \naround autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis engagement with management and organisational \nstructure. \n \nDecision-making \nIn everyday life and in research the most frequent categories of decision-making are \nof the a) normative which is to say formalised idealised type or b) descriptive \napproach which is to say practical type. Croskerry\n84 argues that emergency \ndepartment clinicians rarely adopt the normative mode. Instead they use the flesh \nand blood decision-making (practical mode) that is best suited to addressing the \nneed for accuracy and efficiency. Such strategies are in keeping with Klein et al\u2019s\n85 \n\u201crecognition-primed\u201d decision model in which mental simulation is combined with \nsituation assessment in order to assess courses of action. \n \nDecisions are not made in a vacuum, however. Clinicians need to be aware of how \nthey may wittingly or unwittingly influence the data they gather\n86 from history-\ntaking, physical examination findings, investigatory test findings and so on. \nInfluencing factors on decision-making are not restricted to one\u2019s knowledge \n(whether theoretical, practical, experiential, educational, training, etc.) but extend to \ncommunication skills and sociocultural knowledge and awareness\n87. The \nimportance of such factors is not easily dismissed since it is well recognised that \ndecision-making practices depend upon models of judgement that include i) pattern \nrecognition; ii) ruling out the worst scenario; iii) the exhaustive method; iv) the \nhypotheticodeductive method; v) heuristics; vi) cognitive dispositions to respond \n[Croskerry: footnotes 44 and 75], and vii) the event\n88 in which symptoms are treated \nand then re-evaluated after evaluation of the response to treatment. Clinicians \nbelieve themselves to be taking naturalistic, schema-driven decision-making \napproaches and always compare the relation between the patient\u2019s story and the \ntextbook norm [see Farmer and Higginson, footnote: 75]. \n \nIn other words, what I would call a reality test takes place beside, with and against \nan appeal to the textbook as norm and thus a judgement response can be made to the \npresenting cases (acute coronary syndromes in the Farmer and Higginson [see \nfootnote 75]. A shaping of the response to set it in relation to a textbook discourse \nhas therefore occurred. This is no simple process of comparison and contrast, \nhowever. Croskerry links this textbook model with the representative heuristic \u2013 \nwhat he calls \u201crule of thumb\u201d mode of judgement. Clinicians favour this strategy \nwhen data is ambiguous and the diagnosis uncertain. Prototypical features of the \ndisease are sought and the likelihood of the disease based upon how well the \npatient\u2019s symptoms correspond with those believed typical of the disease in \nquestion is estimated. That is to say that the textbook norm is not a static model, \nrather it undergoes a degree of revision such that the reference posts are moved, \n                                                 \n84 Croskerry P cited in Farmer & Higginson: see footnote 62 \n85 Klein et al: cited in Farmer & Higginson: see footnote 62 \n86 Farmer & Higginson: see footnote 62 \n87 Farmer & Higginson: see footnote 62 \n88 Sandhu H, Carpenter C, Freeman K, Section Editor, Namors SG, Section Editor & Olson A, \nSection Editor. \u201cClinical Decision Making: Opening the Black Box of Cognitive Reasoning\u201d in Ann \nEmerg Med Dec 2006; 48: 713-9 Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 90 \ndepending upon professional experience and cultural beliefs. Klein\u2019s recognition-\nprimed decision-making model exhibits some similarities with the Croskerry model \nof rule of thumb inasmuch as it involves an intuitive judgement process, grounded \nin knowledge and experience. These models, however, offer only part descriptions \nfor clinical judgement. They do not provide insights into how the clinician gathers \ndata, interprets that data and incorporates data into professional schematic \nimpressions of the presenting illness for a particular patient. Such models are too \ncrude to describe how salient professionals make clinical judgements that inform \nreal-time complex decision-making processes. \n \nCroskerry suggests that it is taken for granted that postgraduate trainees have \nsomehow developed the ability to think clearly and critically and thus be able to \ndistinguish foreground from distracting background stimuli, bias, irrelevance and \npropaganda. The expectation is that they can identify, analyse and challenge \nassumptions in arguments as well as being able to recognise deception whether \nexplicit or not, assess the credibility of information, be critically aware of and in \ncontrol of their own ways of thinking and, finally, be able to imagine and explore \nalternatives. It is further assumed that all of these faculties are fully developed and \nalso easily put into action even in stressful contexts, such as fatigue and\/or actual \nsleep deprivation. These expectations, for the most part, cannot be substantiated\n89. \nCroskerry explores further, pointing out that critical thinking is essential to \ndecision-making. Two systems of thinking are identified: system 1 which is much \nas has been described above; and system 2, which operates within a slower, more \nrational, more deductive, rule-based and analytical mode. System 1 incorporates \nimpulsivity and speed, and occurs in the time it takes to blink one\u2019s eye, engaging, \nas it does, in a rapid cognitive thin-slicing style that recognises patterns and \nbehaviours \u201con very narrow slices of experience\u201d in what appears to be intuitive \nflashes of judgement\n90. Given the fact that the adjective \u201cintuitive\u201d was used, it \nmust come as no surprise that there is a proviso attached: namely, the success of \nsuch intuitive flashes is heavily dependent upon considerable professional \nexperience that has taken years of dedication to achieve. This is no style for a \nnovice, nor is it foolproof for experienced clinicians. \n \nBy now the reader will have noted that while I have constructed a simple schemata \nof eight apparently distinct points, which I\u2019m addressing one by one in this section \nof the literature review, in practice once I begin to explore the questions and issues \nthat arise out of them, the distinctness of the boundaries begin to collapse as one \nmerges into another and into another and so on, in keeping with the feature of \npluralism, alluded to earlier in this literature review. \n \nKnowledge and performance \nIs it a function of CPD to contribute to reducing medical errors? Given that the \nGMC\u2019s definition (see footnote: 21) links CPD to improving patient care, the picture \nis assuredly not black and white. Where does one draw the boundary between CPD \nand quality assurance (see section above subtitled: Boundary issues: CPD or quality \nassurance). In the context of reducing medical errors\n91 \n92 when are we talking about \nCPD and not about education, training and\/or experiential learning and vice-versa?  \n                                                 \n89 Croskerry P Dec 2006 Ann Emerg Med 48: 720-2: see footnote: 56 \n90 Gladwell M (2005) as cited in Croskerry P Dec 2006 Ann Emerg Med 48 (6): 720-2 \n91 Moskop et al Nov 2006 Ann Emerg Med footnote 29 Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 91 \n \nIdentifying personal learning needs, seeking the \u201cmeans\u201d (CPD) by which to \u201cfill\u201d \nthe gap in actual practice \nVarious cycles (Guly\u2019s [see footnote: 27]; Kolb\u2019s experiential learning cycle, Daley\u2019s \n[see footnote 58 ]; action research cycle\n93) and models of education in which learning \nis constituted as a \u201cproduct\u201d\n94 to be delivered\n95 \n96, or as a \u201cprocess\u201d [see footnote: \n27] or as \u201cresearch\u201d along with models of learners as reflective practitioners have \nbeen discussed previously. Activity theory\n97 might also be considered here. The \ndevelopment of critical thinking practices also needs to be considered here\n98. \nFormulating arguments to back up one\u2019s critical thinking practices depends upon \none\u2019s ability to find evidence when one needs it\n99. Wears & Nemeth [see footnote: \n65] propose that viewing the making of a diagnosis as operating through \nperspectives and sense-making is a more useful model than viewing it through \nnotions of performance, since givens are thereby changed to real-world problems \nthat thus have to be constructed from circumstances that are puzzling, troubling, \nuncertain and possibly irrelevant and somehow undergo transformation into medical \nproblems. \n \nThe simplistic schemata constructed above and the brief introductory overview \ngleaned from the two scoping exercises can only skim the surface of the complexity \nof the range and depth of clinical, professional and managerial knowledge, skills \nand practice of medicine.  \n \nConclusion \nCPD, then, combines continuous learning and professional development and is \nassociated with career progression and improved patient care. It is often closely \nlinked with appraisal and with revalidation and generally conceptualised in terms of \nperformance. The variety and scale of its provision reflect the wide ranging \ndemands from CPD users and the issues associated with its effectiveness (both for \nthe user and for the assessing body).

In the light of these developments, the GMC in conjunction \nwith the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges have commissioned a study to \ninvestigate the Effectiveness of CPD across all medical specialties.  The study is \nbeing undertaken by the College of Emergency Medicine in association with the \nFederation of Royal College of Physicians. \n \nThis phase of the project involves mapping the current provision of CPD activities \nin terms of access, relationship to professional practice, topic selection, choices of \nsubjects to be made, documentation of learning, what is effective, and effectiveness.   \n \nProviding the information to the following questions would therefore be greatly \nappreciated: \n \nWhat guidelines\/advice does your organisation give to its members \nabout undertaking CPD activities? \n \n \nHow are the guidelines \/ advice provided \u2013 web-based; letters; leaflets;  \nother? \n \n \nDo members provide feedback to your organisation on the CPD \nguidelines \/ advice offered? \n \no  If so, how? \n \n \nWhat is the range of educational CPD opportunities offered by your \norganisation? \n \n \nHow do you identify the need for specific CPD topics? \n Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 122 \n \nHow do you guide your fellows to do specific CPD topics? \n \n \nIs the membership up-take of CPD measured? \n \no  If so, how is CPD audited? \n \n \nHow do your fellows record their CPD? \n \n \nWhat are the characteristics of your organization\u2019s CPD target audience \n- \n \no  Gender ratio \no  Age range \n \n \nDo members provide feedback to your organisation on the guidelines \n\/advice offered?  \n  \no  If so, how? \n \n \nWhat methods does your organisation use to evaluate the effectiveness \nof CPD provision? \n \n \nDo you have any literature on effectiveness of CPD in your specialty?  \n \no  If so, please could you list the relevant references. \n \n \n\u2022  Could you please provide the details of your next specialty \nconference \n \n \nOn behalf of the project team, I look forward to receiving your email response at \nyour earliest convenience.

Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 125 \nAppendix E Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 126 \nAction Research and CPD \n \nby Nick Jenkins \n \nLearning for doctors is recognised as being distributed across a variety of times and \nlocations: formal lectures, small group teaching, conferences as well as self-directed \nsolo \u201cbook work\u201d; at home, at the base hospital, at other hospitals and at \nconferences in the UK and abroad.  Yet multiple learning moments arise in each \nclinical day within the normal service provision of patient care.  Trainees and \nspecialists alike learn from each other, sometimes almost unknowingly. The aim of \nthis study is to identify what makes for good ED teaching, and particularly, how \nsuch learning opportunities might be better facilitated.  Through a practitioner-\nresearcher perspective the study aims to investigate and reflect on learning \nopportunities in an ED, before modifying the researcher\u2019s own participation in such \npractices and re-investigating.  Thus, by exploring strategy-outcome relationships it \nis hoped to develop a basis from which it is possible to facilitate learning and create \na tool for observing and recording such achievement, with view to evaluating that \ntool for possible incorporation into higher specialist training for junior doctors and \nrevalidation for their specialist leaders.   \n \nThe assessment of learning is an increasingly commonplace aspect of a doctor\u2019s \nlife.  It is no longer acceptable for a doctor to affirm that, as a professional they are \ncontinuing to learn and are up-to-date.  Much has changed in the training of junior \ndoctors in the last few years, with the widespread introduction of regular workplace-\nbased assessments as an integral part of training.  Without successful completion of \nthese assessments, trainees are unable to progress to the next stage (or completion) \nof their training.  Also, in response to primary legislation introduced by the current \ngovernment, the General Medical Council and the Medical Royal Colleges are \ndeveloping models for revalidating specialist doctors.  Specialists must now \nmaintain a record of their continuing professional development which tends to focus \non propositional knowledge acquisition from sources such as lectures, courses and \njournals.  There is some credit given for formal teaching, but no recognition of the \nvalue of \u201cinformal\u201d learning and teaching which occurs as a by-product of day-to-\nday patient care, in a responsive context dependent on the case mix and staff mix \nwithin the workplace at any particular time. Hence this study\u2019s place within the \nproject investigating effective CPD practices. \n \nThe study is centred on an evolving research perspective in which a practitioner \nobserves workplace learning possibilities in his own professional setting. By \nseeking to understand better how learning opportunities arise and how specific types \nof learning are produced, he can review his own participation in such learning \nencounters. Later, through his actions in that setting, the practitioner may begin to \nunderstand how such opportunities might be adjusted to achieve different effects. \nThis process will be an hermeneutic enquiry governed by a cyclical action research \nprocess (e.g. Elliott, 1991; Schon 1987; Somekh) linked to a narrative based \ngeneration of reflective accounts of practice (Brown and Jones, 2001). \n  Phase One: Through observation of professional encounters in the \nresearcher\u2019s own everyday clinical setting, accounts of situations in which learning \nappears to take place will be collected. At the same time, similar accounts will be \ncollected of practices that seem detrimental to the generation of learning Effectiveness of Continuous Professional Development page 127 \nopportunities. Such accounts will be sorted according to the types of situations \nnoted: incidental encounters, responses to specific requests, intentional teaching, \nstructural arrangements detrimental to learning etc. Specific teaching sessions in \nclinical settings will be facilitated to include discussion of how learning is seen as \ntaking place. Analysis will take place with a view to understanding better how \nspecific social encounters relate to perceived learning opportunities and the types of \nlearning they appear to make possible. A preliminary register of such encounters \nwill be produced. Particular attention will be paid to the researcher\u2019s own \ninvolvement in such situations through generation of reflections on his own actions \nand how they might have been motivated by an educational or professional agenda. \n  Phase Two: Drawing on the initial analysis of learning encounters further \nobservations will take place with view to assessing practices against this \npreliminary register. In the light of these further observations the register will be \nrefined. Further attention will be given to the practitioner\u2019s own practices with \nregard to how they are aligned or non-aligned with the register. Through an analysis \ngoverned by Mason\u2019s (2002)  \u201cdiscipline of noticing\u201d the practitioner will seek to \npropose and enact alternative strategies within his own participation with a view to \nproducing alternative effects. The action of the researcher will be seen as an \nessential part of the situation being described and thus the narrative becomes an \nintegral part of the research itself.  Writing thus becomes both a method of \nrecording and a way of developing professional practice. The researcher will be \nlocated within the research but will also attempt to move outside the context of the \nresearch to become at the same time observer and observed. \n  Phase Three: This phase will focus on the adjustment of the practitioner\u2019s \nown actions within the clinical setting with regard to a combined professional and \neducational agenda. Specifically as a teacher, learner and manager the \npractitioner\/researcher will evaluate alternative strategies with regard to their impact \non learning opportunities, and how resultant learning might be accounted for against \nthe register. This phase will include further facilitation of teaching sessions to \ninclude discussion of study results enabling local dissemination of the results and \nwith a view to further refining the analytical framework.  \n \nOnce results are available it is planned to disseminate them through publication for \ndiscussion in both medical and educational media. \n \nReferences \nAltrichter,  H.,  Posch,  P.,  &  Somekh,  B.
