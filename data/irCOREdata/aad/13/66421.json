We illustrate the\npresent-day and possible future ILC sensitivities within the constrained minimal supersym-\nmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), in which there are three independent soft\nsupersymmetry-breaking parameters m1\/2, m0 and A0. We analyze the present and future\nsensitivities separately for MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , (g \u2212 2)\u00b5, BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3), BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212), Mh and\nHiggs branching ratios. We display the observables as functions of m1\/2, fixing m0 so as to\nobtain the cold dark matter density allowed by WMAP and other cosmological data for spe-\ncific values of A0, tan \u03b2 and \u00b5 > 0. In a second step, we investigate the combined sensitivity\nof the currently available precision observables, MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 and BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3), by\nperforming a \u03c72 analysis. The current data are in very good agreement with the CMSSM pre-\ndiction for tan \u03b2 = 10, with a clear preference for relatively small values of m1\/2 \u223c 300 GeV.\nIn this case, there would be good prospects for observing supersymmetry directly at both the\nLHC and the ILC. For tan\u03b2 = 50, the quality of the fit is worse, and somewhat larger m1\/2\nvalues are favoured. With the prospective ILC accuracies the sensitivity to indirect effects of\nsupersymmetry greatly improves. This may provide indirect access to supersymmetry even\nat scales beyond the direct reach of the LHC or the ILC.\nCERN\u2013PH\u2013TH\/2004-220\nNovember 2004\n1 Introduction\nMeasurements at low energies may provide interesting indirect information about the masses\nof particles that are too heavy to be produced directly. A prime example is the use of precision\nelectroweak data from LEP, the SLC, the Tevatron and elsewhere to predict (successfully) the\nmass of the top quark and to provide an indication of the possible mass of the hypothetical\nHiggs boson [1]. Predicting the masses of supersymmetric particles is much more difficult\nthan for the top quark or even the Higgs boson, because the renormalizability of the Standard\nModel and the decoupling theorem imply that many low-energy observables are insensitive to\nheavy sparticles. Nevertheless, present data on observables such asMW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , (g\u22122)\u00b5 and\nBR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) already provide interesting information on the scale of supersymmetry (SUSY),\nas we discuss in this paper, and have a great potential in view of prospective improvements\nof experimental and theoretical accuracies.\nIn the future, a linear e+e\u2212 collider (ILC) will be the best available tool for making\nmany precision measurements [2]. It is important to understand what information ILC\nmeasurements may provide about supersymmetry, both for the part of the spectrum directly\naccessible at the LHC or the ILC and for sparticles that would be too heavy to be produced\ndirectly. Comparing the indirect indications with the direct measurements would be an\nimportant consistency check on the theoretical framework of supersymmetry.\nImproved and more complete calculations of the supersymmetric contributions to a num-\nber of low-energy observables such as MW and sin\n2 \u03b8eff have recently become available (see\nthe discussion in Sect. 3 below). These, combined with estimates of the experimental accu-\nracies attainable at the ILC and future theoretical uncertainties from unknown higher-order\ncorrections, make now an opportune moment to assess the likely sensitivities of ILC mea-\nsurements.\nThere have been many previous studies of the sensitivity of low-energy observables to the\nscale of supersymmetry, including, for example, the precision electroweak observables [3\u20139].\nSuch analyses are bedevilled by the large dimensionality of even the minimal supersymmet-\nric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), once supersymmetry-breaking parameters are\ntaken into account. For this reason, simplifying assumptions that may be more or less well\nmotivated are often made, so as to reduce the parameter space to a manageable dimension-\nality. Following many previous studies, we work here in the framework of the constrained\nMSSM (CMSSM), in which the soft supersymmetry-breaking scalar and gaugino masses are\neach assumed to be equal at some GUT input scale. In this case, the new independent MSSM\nparameters are just four in number: the universal gaugino mass m1\/2, the scalar mass m0,\n1\nthe trilinear soft supersymmetry-breaking parameter A0, and the ratio tan \u03b2 of Higgs vac-\nuum expectation values. The pseudoscalar Higgs mass MA and the magnitude of the Higgs\nmixing parameter \u00b5 can be determined by using the electroweak vacuum conditions, leaving\nthe sign of \u00b5 as a residual ambiguity.\nThe non-discoveries of supersymmetric particles and the Higgs boson at LEP and other\npresent-day colliders impose significant lower bounds on m1\/2 and m0. An important fur-\nther constraint is provided by the density of dark matter in the Universe, which is tightly\nconstrained by WMAP and other astrophysical and cosmological data [10]. These have the\neffect within the CMSSM, assuming that the dark matter consists largely of neutralinos [11],\nof restricting m0 to very narrow allowed strips for any specific choice of A0, tan\u03b2 and the\nsign of \u00b5 [12,13]. Thus, the dimensionality of the supersymmetric parameter space is further\nreduced, and one may explore supersymmetric phenomenology along these \u2018WMAP strips\u2019,\nas has already been done for the direct detection of supersymmetric particles at the LHC and\nlinear colliders of varying energies [14\u201319]. A full likelihood analysis of the CMSSM planes\nincorporating uncertainties in the cosmological relic density was performed in Ref. [20]. The\nprincipal aim of this paper is to extend this analysis to indirect effects of supersymmetry.\nWe consider the following observables: the W boson mass, MW , the effective weak mix-\ning angle at the Z boson resonance, sin2 \u03b8eff , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon,\n(g \u2212 2)\u00b5 and the rare b decays BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) and BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212), as well as the mass of the\nlightest CP-even Higgs boson, Mh, and the Higgs branching ratios BR(h \u2192 bb\u00af)\/BR(h \u2192\nWW \u2217). We first analyze the sensitivity of each observable to indirect effects of supersym-\nmetry, taking into account the present and prospective future experimental and theoretical\nuncertainties. We then investigate the combined sensitivity of those observables for which\nexperimental determinations exist at present, i.e., MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 and BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3).\nWe perform \u03c72 analyses both for fixed values of A0 and for scans in the (m1\/2, A0) plane for\ntan \u03b2 = 10 and 50 with \u00b5 > 0. We find a remarkably high sensitivity of the current data for\nthe electroweak precision observables to the scale of supersymmetry. In the case tan \u03b2 = 10,\nwe find a preference for moderate values of m1\/2 \u223c 300 GeV, in which case sparticles should\nbe observable at both the LHC and the ILC. In the case tan\u03b2 = 50, the global fit is not\nso good, and low values of m1\/2 are not so strongly preferred. In order to investigate the\npossible future sensitivities we study the combined effect of all the above observables (except\nBR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212), which is discussed separately). For this purpose we choose certain values\nof (m1\/2, A0) as assumed future \u2018best-fit\u2019 values (corresponding to the central values of the\nobservables) and investigate the indirect constraints arising from the precision observables\nfor prospective experimental and theoretical uncertainties.\n2\nIn Section 2 of the paper we specify the WMAP strips and discuss their dependences\non A0 and the top-quark mass. We discuss in Section 3 the present and future sensitivities\nof the different precision observables to the scale of supersymmetry, represented by m1\/2 as\none moves along different WMAP strips. In Section 4 we analyze the combined sensitivity\nof the precision observables for the present situation, and Section 5 presents the prospec-\ntive combined sensitivity assuming the accuracies expected to become available at the ILC\nwith its GigaZ option. Finally, Section 6 gives our conclusions. In most of the scenarios\nstudied, even if it does not produce sparticles directly, the ILC will check the consistency of\nthe CMSSM at the loop level and thereby provide valuable extra information beyond that\nobtainable with the LHC.\n2 Supersymmetric dark matter and WMAP strips\nIt is well known that the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is an excellent candidate\nfor cold dark matter (CDM) [11], with a density that falls naturally within the range\n0.094 < \u2126CDMh\n2 < 0.129 favoured by a joint analysis of WMAP and other astrophysical\nand cosmological data [10]. Assuming that the cold dark matter is composed predominantly\nof LSPs, the uncertainty in the determination of \u2126CDMh\n2 effectively reduces by one the\ndimensionality of the MSSM parameter space. Specifically, if one assumes that the soft\nsupersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses m1\/2 and scalar masses m0 are universal at some\nGUT input scale, as in the CMSSM studied here, the (m1\/2, m0) planes usually studied for\nfixed A0, tan\u03b2 and sign of \u00b5 are effectively reduced to narrow strips of limited thickness in\nm0 for any given value of m1\/2 [12] and the other parameters.\nThese strips have been delineated and parametrized when A0 = 0 for several choices\nof tan\u03b2 for each sign of \u00b5, and the possible LHC and ILC phenomenology along these\nlines has been discussed [16]. As preliminaries to studying indirect sensitivities to the scale\nof supersymmetry along some of these WMAP strips, we first address a couple of physics\nissues. One is that the experimental central value of mt has changed since Ref. [16], from\n174.3 GeV to 178.0 GeV [21], and the other is the dependence of the WMAP strips on A0.\nThe change in mt has a significant effect on the regions of CMSSM parameter space allowed,\nparticularly in the focus-point region where the range of m0 allowed by cosmology now starts\nabove 4 TeV. In view of the high values of m0 and the sensitivity to mt [22], we do not study\nthe focus-point region further in this paper. There are also mt- and A0-dependent effects\nin the \u2018funnels\u2019 where neutralinos annihilate rapidly via the H,A poles. These affect the\ndependence of m0 on m1\/2 along the WMAP lines, as we now discuss in more detail. As\n3\nexplained below, because of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, we focus on cases\nwith \u00b5 > 0.\nPlotted in Fig. 1 is the region in the (m1\/2, m0) plane for fixed tan\u03b2,A0 and \u00b5 > 0 for\nwhich the relic density is in the WMAP range (the results of [9] are in qualitative agreement\nwith Ref. [23]). We have applied cuts based on the lower limit to the Higgs mass, b\u2192 s\u03b3, and\nrequire that the LSP be a neutralino rather than the stau. The thin strips correspond to the\nrelic density being determined by either the coannihilation between nearly degenerate \u03c4\u02dc \u2019s and\n\u03c7\u2019s or, as seen at high tan \u03b2, by rapid annihilation whenm\u03c7 \u2248MA\/2. We see in Fig. 1(a) that\nthe WMAP strip for \u00b5 > 0 and tan\u03b2 = 10 does not change much as mt is varied, reflecting\nthe fact that the allowed strip is dominated by annihilation of the neutralino LSP \u03c7 with the\nlighter stau slepton \u03c4\u02dc1. The main effect of varying mt is that the truncation at low m1\/2, due\nto the Higgs mass constraint, becomes more important at low mt. This effect is not visible\nin Fig. 1(b) for tan\u03b2 = 50, where the cutoff at low m1\/2 is due to the b \u2192 s\u03b3 constraint,\nand rapid \u03c7\u03c7\u2192 A,H annihilation is important at large m1\/2. The allowed regions at larger\nm1\/2 vary significantly with mt when tan\u03b2 = 50, because the A,H masses and hence the\nrapid-annihilation regions are very sensitive to mt through the renormalization group (RG)\nrunning. Indeed, the rapid-annihilation region almost disappears for mt = 182 GeV at this\nvalue of tan \u03b2. In this case, in particular, we see a wisp of allowed CMSSM parameter space\nrunning almost parallel to, but significantly above, the familiar coannihilation strip, which is\ndue to rapid \u03c4\u02dc1\u00af\u02dc\u03c4 1 \u2192 H annihilation. At higher values of tan\u03b2 the rapid-annihilation region\nwould reappear for mt = 182 GeV.\nWe now turn to the variation of the WMAP strips for different A0, but with mt fixed\nto mt = 178 GeV. Since the WMAP strips are largely independent of the sign of \u00b5, for\nclarity we show them in Fig. 2 only for \u00b5 > 0. We see in Fig. 2(a,b) that the WMAP strip\nfor tan \u03b2 = 10 also does not change much as A0 is varied: the main effect is for the strip\nto move to larger m0 as |A0| is increased. This is because the main effect of A0 is on the\nrunning of the diagonal stau masses, whose RG equations depend only on A20. The splitting\nof the two stau masses depends on the sign of A0 via the off-diagonal entries in the stau\nmass matrix, but the impact of this effect on the final stau masses is relatively small. Hence\nthe WMAP strips rise for both signs of A0. For a given value of m1\/2, m0 and tan\u03b2, the\nlow-energy value of A\u03c4 is shifted from its high-energy value, A0, by an amount \u2206A that\nis relatively independent of A0. Therefore, for |A0| much larger than \u2206A, the low-energy\nvalue of A\u03c4 will be larger than that for A0 = 0, causing the right-handed stau soft mass to\ndrop. This in turn increases the value of m0 corresponding to the coannihilation strip. Only\nwhen the low-energy value of |A\u03c4 | is less than and of opposite sign to \u2206A does the light stau\n4\n100 1000 1500\n0\n1000\nmt = 178 GeV\nmt = 174 GeV\nmt = 182 GeV\n500\n500m\n0 \n(G\neV\n)\nm1\/2 (GeV)\ntan \u03b2 = 10 ,  \u00b5 > 0\n100 1000 2000 2500\n0\n1000\n1500\n500\n500\nm\n0 \n(G\neV\n)\nm1\/2 (GeV)\ntan \u03b2 = 50 ,  \u00b5 > 0\n1500\nmt = 178 GeV\nmt = 174 GeV\nmt = 182 GeV\nFigure 1: The WMAP strips for \u00b5 > 0, A0 = 0 and (a) tan\u03b2 = 10, (b) tan\u03b2 = 50, showing\nthe dependence on the top-quark mass, for mt = 174, 178 and 182 GeV.\nmass increase. In the specific examples shown in Fig. 2(a,b), \u2206A ranges from about 130\nGeV at low m1\/2 to about 550 GeV at high m1\/2. Since the shifts are always positive, the\ncoannihilation strip rises less for negative values of A0 (Fig. 2(b)) than for positive values\n(Fig. 2(a)).\nThe WMAP regions for tan\u03b2 = 50 vary much more rapidly with |A0|, because of the\nsensitivity of the A,H masses and hence the rapid-annihilation regions. In Fig. 2(c) the case\nfor A0 \u2265 0 can be seen, whereas Fig. 2(d) shows A0 \u2264 0. We again see wisps of allowed\nCMSSM parameter space due to rapid \u03c4\u02dc1\u00af\u02dc\u03c4 1 \u2192 H annihilation. In this case, as described\nabove, the right-handed stau mass is sensitive to the value of A0. Therefore, for A0 6= 0\n(Fig. 2(c,d)), the cosmologically preferred region shifts to larger m0 for both signs of A0. In\naddition, the value of the heavy Higgs scalar and pseudoscalar masses depends on A0 (not\nonly A20) and the position of the rapid-annihilation funnels therefore depends sensitively\non A0.\nIn the following, we mainly present our results along the WMAP strips formt = 178 GeV,\nthe present experimental central value [21], but we do show results for different values of |A0|.\nThis is because the variation with mt is less important for tan \u03b2 = 10, and comparable with\nthat due to varying |A0| when tan \u03b2 = 50. Additionally, we present scans of the (m1\/2, A0)\nplanes for tan\u03b2 = 10 and 50.\n5\n100 1000 1500\n0\n1000\n500\n500m\n0 \n(G\neV\n)\nm1\/2 (GeV)\ntan \u03b2 = 10 ,  \u00b5 > 0\nA0  =  0\nA0        = + 2 m1\/2\nA0  =  + m1\/2\n100 1000 1500\n0\n1000\n500\n500m\n0 \n(G\neV\n)\nm1\/2 (GeV)\ntan \u03b2 = 10 ,  \u00b5 > 0\nA0  =  0\nA0        = \u2212 2 m1\/2\nA0  =  \u2212 m1\/2\n100 1000 2000 2500\n0\n1000\n1500\n500\n500\nm\n0 \n(G\neV\n)\nm1\/2 (GeV)\ntan \u03b2 = 50 ,  \u00b5 > 0\n1500\nA0  =  0\nA0        = + 2 m1\/2\nA0  =  + m1\/2\n100 1000 2000 2500\n0\n1000\n1500\n500\n500\nm\n0 \n(G\neV\n)\nm1\/2 (GeV)\ntan \u03b2 = 50 ,  \u00b5 > 0\n1500\nA0  =  0\nA0        = \u2212 2 m1\/2\nA0  =  \u2212 m1\/2\nFigure 2: The WMAP strips for \u00b5 > 0, mt = 178 GeV and (a) tan\u03b2 = 10, A0 \u2265 0 (upper\nleft), (b) tan \u03b2 = 10, A0 \u2264 0 (upper right), (c) tan\u03b2 = 50, A0 \u2265 0 (lower left), (d) tan \u03b2 = 50,\nA0 \u2264 0 (lower right) showing the dependence on A0 for A0 = 0,\u00b1m1\/2 and \u00b12m1\/2.\n6\n3 Present and future sensitivities to the scale of super-\nsymmetry from low-energy observables\nIn this section, we briefly describe the low-energy observables used in our analysis. We discuss\nthe current and prospective future precision of the experimental results and the theoretical\npredictions. In the following, we refer to the theoretical uncertainties from unknown higher-\norder corrections as \u2018intrinsic\u2019 theoretical uncertainties and to the uncertainties induced by\nthe experimental errors of the input parameters as \u2018parametric\u2019 theoretical uncertainties. We\nalso give relevant details of the higher-order perturbative corrections that we include. We do\nnot discuss theoretical uncertainties from the RG running between the high-scale parameters\nand the weak scale (see Ref. [19] for a recent discussion in the context of predicting the\nCDM density). At present, these uncertainties are expected to be less important than\nthe experimental and theoretical uncertainties of the precision observables. In the future,\nboth the uncertainties from unknown higher-order terms in the RG running and from the\nparameters entering the running will considerably improve.\nResults for these observables are shown as a function of m1\/2 with A0 varied, m0 deter-\nmined by the WMAP constraint (see Sect. 2), and tan \u03b2 = 10, 50. In this way the indirect\nsensitivities of the low-energy observables to the scale of supersymmetry are investigated.\n3.1 The W boson mass\nThe W boson mass can be evaluated from\nM2W\n(\n1\u2212 M\n2\nW\nM2Z\n)\n=\npi\u03b1\u221a\n2GF\n(1 + \u2206r) , (1)\nwhere \u03b1 is the fine structure constant and GF the Fermi constant. The radiative corrections\nare summarized in the quantity \u2206r [24]. The prediction for MW within the Standard Model\n(SM) or the MSSM is obtained from evaluating \u2206r in these models and solving eq. (1) in an\niterative way.\nThe one-loop contributions to \u2206r can be written as\n\u2206r = \u2206\u03b1\u2212 c\n2\nW\ns2W\n\u2206\u03c1+ (\u2206r)rem, (2)\nwhere \u2206\u03b1 is the shift in the fine structure constant due to the light fermions of the SM,\n\u2206\u03b1 \u221d logmf , and \u2206\u03c1 is the leading contribution to the \u03c1 parameter. It is given by fermion\nand sfermion loop contributions to the transverse parts of the gauge boson self-energies at\n7\nzero external momentum,\n\u2206\u03c1 =\n\u03a3Z(0)\nM2Z\n\u2212 \u03a3W (0)\nM2W\n. (3)\nThe remainder part, (\u2206r)rem, contains in particular the contributions from the Higgs sector.\nWe include the complete one-loop result in the MSSM [25,26] as well as higher-order QCD\ncorrections of SM type of O(\u03b1\u03b1s) [27,28] and O(\u03b1\u03b12s) [29,30]. Furthermore, we incorporate\nsupersymmetric corrections of O(\u03b1\u03b1s) [31] and of O(\u03b12t ) [32] to \u2206\u03c1.\nThe remaining intrinsic theoretical uncertainty in the prediction for MW within the\nMSSM is still significantly larger than in the SM, where it is currently estimated to be\nabout 4 MeV [33]. We estimate the present [34] and future intrinsic uncertainties to be\n\u2206M intr,currentW = 10 MeV, \u2206M\nintr,future\nW = 2 MeV. (4)\nThe parametric uncertainties are dominated by the experimental error of the top-quark mass\nand the hadronic contribution to the shift in the fine structure constant. The current errors\ninduce the following parametric uncertainties\n\u03b4mcurrentt = 4.3 GeV \u21d2 \u2206Mpara,mt,currentW \u2248 26 MeV, (5)\n\u03b4(\u2206\u03b1currenthad ) = 36\u00d7 10\u22125 \u21d2 \u2206Mpara,\u2206\u03b1had,currentW \u2248 6.5 MeV. (6)\nAt the ILC, the top-quark mass will be measured with an accuracy of about 100 MeV [2].\nThe parametric uncertainties induced by the future experimental errors of mt and \u2206\u03b1had [35]\nwill then be [36]\n\u03b4mfuturet = 0.1 GeV \u21d2 \u2206Mpara,mt,futureW \u2248 1 MeV, (7)\n\u03b4(\u2206\u03b1futurehad ) = 5\u00d7 10\u22125 \u21d2 \u2206Mpara,\u2206\u03b1had,futureW \u2248 1 MeV.

(9)\nWith the GigaZ option of the ILC (i.e. high-luminosity running at the Z resonance and the\nWW threshold) the W -boson mass will be determined with an accuracy of about [37,38]\n\u03b4M exp,futureW = 7 MeV. (10)\nIn all plots of this section we show the theory predictions without parametric and intrinsic\ntheoretical uncertainties (usingmt = 178 GeV).

It is striking that the present central value of MW (for\nboth values of tan \u03b2) favours low values of m1\/2 \u223c 200\u2013300 GeV, though values as large as\n800 GeV are allowed at the 1-\u03c3 level, and essentially all values of m1\/2 are allowed at the\n90% confidence level. The GigaZ determination ofMW might be able to determine indirectly\na low value of m1\/2 with an accuracy of \u00b150 GeV, but even the GigaZ precision would still\nbe insufficient to determine m1\/2 accurately if m1\/2 >\u223c 600 GeV.\n3.2 The effective leptonic weak mixing angle\nThe effective leptonic weak mixing angle at the Z boson resonance can be written as\nsin2 \u03b8eff =\n1\n4\n(\n1\u2212 Re veff\naeff\n)\n, (11)\nwhere veff and aeff denote the effective vector and axial couplings of the Z boson to charged\nleptons.

For the MSSM, we use as present [34] and\nfuture intrinsic uncertainties\n\u2206 sin2 \u03b8intr,currenteff = 12\u00d7 10\u22125, \u2206sin2 \u03b8intr,futureeff = 2\u00d7 10\u22125.

(17)\nIt is well known that there is a 2.8-\u03c3 discrepancy [1] between the leptonic and heavy-\nflavour determinations of the electroweak mixing angle, with the leptonic measurement of\nsin2 \u03b8eff tending to pull down the value of Higgs-boson mass preferred in the SM fit, whereas\nthe heavy-flavour measurements favour a larger value of the Higgs mass. The Electroweak\nWorking Group notes that the overall quality of a global electroweak fit is quite acceptable,\n\u223c 26% [1], and we use their combination of the two sets of measurements:\nsin2 \u03b8exp,currenteff = 0.23150\u00b1 0.00016.

Since the possible deviation of the SM prediction from\nthe experimental result is crucial for the interpretation of the a\u00b5 results, we first review this\naspect in the light of recent developments.\nThe SM prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (see Refs. [41, 42] for\nreviews) depends on the evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarization and light-by-light\n(LBL) contributions. The former have been evaluated in [43\u201346] and the latter in [47, 48].\nThe evaluations of the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions using e+e\u2212 and \u03c4 decay\ndata give somewhat different results. Recently, new data have been published by the KLOE\nCollaboration [49], which agree well with the previous data from CMD-2. This, coupled\n11\nwith a greater respect for the uncertainties inherent in the isospin transformation from \u03c4\ndecay, has led to a proposal to use the e+e\u2212 alone and shelve the \u03c4 data, resulting in the\nestimate [50]\natheo\u00b5 = (11 659 182.8\u00b1 6.3had \u00b1 3.5LBL \u00b1 0.3QED+EW)\u00d7 10\u221210, (20)\nwhere the source of each error is labelled 1.\nThis result is to be compared with the final result of the Brookhaven (g\u22122)\u00b5 Experiment\nE821, namely [52]\naexp\u00b5 = (11 659 208.0\u00b1 5.8)\u00d7 10\u221210, (21)\nleading to an estimated discrepancy\naexp\u00b5 \u2212 atheo\u00b5 = (25.2\u00b1 9.2)\u00d7 10\u221210, (22)\nequivalent to a 2.7 \u03c3 effect. In view of the chequered history of the SM prediction, eq. (20),\nand the residual questions concerning the use of the \u03c4 decay data, it would be premature\nto regard this discrepancy as firm evidence of new physics. We do note, on the other hand,\nthat the (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 measurement imposes an important constraint on supersymmetry, even if\none uses the \u03c4 decay data. We use eq. (22) for our numerical discussion below.\nThe following MSSM contributions to the theoretical prediction for a\u00b5 have been con-\nsidered. We take fully into account the complete one-loop contribution to a\u00b5, which was\nevaluated nearly a decade ago in Ref. [53]. We make no simplification in the sparticle mass\nscales but, for illustrating the possible size of corrections, a simplified formula can be used,\nin which relevant supersymmetric mass scales are set to a common value, MSUSY = m\u03c7\u02dc\u00b1 =\nm\u03c7\u02dc0 = m\u00b5\u02dc = m\u03bd\u02dc\u00b5 . The result in this approximation is given by\naSUSY,1L\u00b5 = 13\u00d7 10\u221210\n(\n100 GeV\nMSUSY\n)2\ntan \u03b2 sign(\u00b5). (23)\nWe see that supersymmetric effects can easily account for a (20 . . . 30)\u00d710\u221210 deviation, if \u00b5\nis positive andMSUSY lies roughly between 100 GeV (for small tan\u03b2) and 600 GeV (for large\ntan \u03b2). For this reason, in the rest of this paper, we restrict our attention to \u00b5 > 0. Even in\nview of the possible size of experimental and theoretical uncertainties, it is very difficult to\nreconcile \u00b5 < 0 with the present data on a\u00b5.\nIn addition to the full one-loop contributions, we also include several two-loop corrections.\nThe first class of corrections comprises the leading log (m\u00b5\/MSUSY) terms of supersymmetric\n1The updated QED result from [51] is included.\n12\none-loop diagrams with a photon in the second loop, which are given by [54]:\n\u2206aSUSY,2L,QED\u00b5 = \u2206a\nSUSY,1L\n\u00b5 \u00d7\n(\n4\u03b1\npi\nlog\n(\nMSUSY\nm\u00b5\n))\n. (24)\nThese amount to about \u22128% of the supersymmetric one-loop contribution for a supersym-\nmetric mass scale MSUSY = 500 GeV.\nThe second class of two-loop corrections comprises diagrams with a closed loop of SM\nfermions or scalar fermions. These were calculated in Ref. [55], where it was demonstrated\nthat these corrections may amount to \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 in the general MSSM, if all experi-\nmental bounds are taken into account. These corrections are included in the Fortran code\nFeynHiggs [56, 57]. We have furthermore taken into account the 2-loop contributions to\na\u00b5 from diagrams containing a closed chargino\/neutralino loop, which have been evalu-\nated in [58]. Here we use an approximate form for these corrections, which are typically\n\u223c 1\u00d7 10\u221210.\nThe current intrinsic uncertainties in the MSSM contributions to a\u00b5 can be estimated\nto be \u223c 6 \u00d7 10\u221210 [58, 59]. In the more restricted CMSSM parameter space the intrinsic\nuncertainties are smaller, being about 1\u00d7 10\u221210. Once the full two-loop result in the MSSM\nis available, this uncertainty will be further reduced. We assume that in the future the\nuncertainty in eq. (22) will be reduced by a factor two.\nAs seen in Fig. 5, the CMSSM prediction for a\u00b5 is almost independent of A0 for tan \u03b2 =\n10, but substantial variations are possible for tan\u03b2 = 50, except at very large m1\/2. In the\ncase tan\u03b2 = 10, m1\/2 \u223c 200\u2013400 GeV is again favoured at the \u00b11-\u03c3 level, but this preferred\nrange shifts up to 400 to 800 GeV if tan\u03b2 = 50, depending on the value of A0. At the 2-\u03c3\nlevel, there is nominally an upper bound m1\/2 <\u223c 600(1100) GeV for tan\u03b2 = 10(50), but\naccording to the discussion above it should be interpreted with care. Nevertheless, the lower\nbound to m1\/2 for both tan \u03b2 = 10 and 50 should be regarded as relatively robust. On the\nother hand, it is striking that MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff and a\u00b5 all favour small m1\/2 for tan \u03b2 = 10. If\ntan \u03b2 = 50, the consistency between the ranges preferred by the different observables is not\nso striking.\n3.4 The decay b\u2192 s\u03b3\nSince this decay occurs at the loop level in the SM, the MSSM contribution might, a priori,\nbe of similar magnitude. The most up-to-date theoretical estimate of the SM contribution\nto the branching ratio is [60]\nBR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) = (3.70\u00b1 0.30)\u00d7 10\u22124, (25)\n13\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nm1\/2 [GeV]\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n\u2206a\n\u00b5 \n[10\n-\n10\n]\nCMSSM, \u00b5 > 0\ntan\u03b2 = 10\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = 0\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = +m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = -m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = +2 m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = -2 m1\/2\nFigure 5: The CMSSM prediction for \u2206a\u00b5 as a function of m1\/2 along the WMAP strips for\ntan \u03b2 = 10, 50 and different A0 values.

Finally, our results have been checked with the\nBR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) evaluation provided in Ref. [65], which yielded very similar results to our\ntwo other approaches. For the current theoretical uncertainty of the MSSM prediction for\nBR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) we use the value of eq. (25).

The uncertainty shown\ncombines linearly the current experimental error and the present theoretical uncertainty in\nthe SM prediction. The central (solid) line indicates the current experimental central value,\nand the other solid (dotted) lines show the current \u00b11(2)-\u03c3 ranges. The dash-dotted line\ncorresponds to a more conservative estimate of intrinsic uncertainties (see text).\nAs already mentioned, the present central value of this branching ratio agrees very well\nwith the SM, implying that large values of m1\/2 cannot be excluded for any value of tan\u03b2.\nThe uncertainty range shown in Fig. 6 combines linearly the current experimental error\nand the present theoretical uncertainty in the SM prediction. Note however, that at present\nthere is also an uncertainty in the computed MSSM value (included in obtaining the excluded\nregions in Figs. 1 and 2) from the uncertainty in the SUSY loop calculations. Taking this\nconservatively into account results in a 95% C.L. exclusion bound of 0.00016 in the case of\ntan \u03b2 = 10, and of 0.000195 in the case of tan\u03b2 = 50. These values are shown as dash-dotted\n2We are grateful to P. Gambino and G. Ganis for providing the corresponding code.\n3We thank Gudrun Hiller for providing the corresponding Fortran code.\n15\nlines in Fig. 6. This allows a somewhat lower range in m1\/2 than depicted in Fig. 6. We\nassume that these uncertainties can be significantly reduced in the future. We have checked\nthat they have no significant impact on the results presented below.\nSince the CMSSM corrections are generally smaller for smaller tan\u03b2, even values of m1\/2\nas low as \u223c 200 GeV would be allowed at the 90% confidence level if tan\u03b2 = 10, whereas\nm1\/2 >\u223c 450 GeV would be required if tan\u03b2 = 50. These limits are very sensitive to A0, and,\nif the future error in BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) could indeed be reduced by a factor \u223c 3, the combination\nof BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) with the other precision observables might be able, in principle, to constrain\nA0 significantly.\n3.5 The branching ratio Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212\nThe SM prediction for this branching ratio is (3.4\u00b1 0.5)\u00d7 10\u22129 [66], and the present exper-\nimental upper limit from the Fermilab Tevatron collider is 3.4\u00d7 10\u22127 at the 95% C.L. [67],\nproviding ample room for the MSSM to dominate the SM contribution. The current Tevatron\nsensitivity, being based on an integrated luminosity of about 410 pb\u22121 summed over both\ndetectors, is expected to improve significantly in the future. A naive scaling of the present\nbound with the square root of the luminosity yields a sensitivity at the end of Run II of\nabout 5.4\u00d710\u22128 assuming 8 fb\u22121 collected with each detector. An even bigger improvement\nmay be possible with better signal acceptance and more efficient background reduction. In\nRef. [68] an estimate of the future Tevatron sensitivity of 2\u00d7 10\u22128 at the 90% C.L. has been\ngiven, and a sensitivity even down to the SM value can be expected at the LHC. Assuming\nthe SM value, i.e. BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) \u2248 3.4\u00d7 10\u22129, it has been estimated [69] that LHCb can\nobserve 33 signal events over 10 background events within 3 years of low-luminosity running.\nTherefore this process offers good prospects for probing the MSSM.\nFor the theoretical prediction we use results from Ref. [70]4, which include the full one-\nloop evaluation and the leading two-loop QCD corrections. We are not aware of a detailed\nestimate of the theoretical uncertainties from unknown higher-order corrections.\nIn Fig. 7 the CMSSM prediction for BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) as a function of m1\/2 is compared\nwith the present Tevatron limit and our estimate for the sensitivity at the end of Run II.\nFor tan \u03b2 = 10 the CMSSM prediction is significantly below the present and future Tevatron\nsensitivity. With the current sensitivity, the Tevatron starts to probe the CMSSM region\nwith tan\u03b2 = 50. The sensitivity at the end of Run II will test the CMSSM parameter space\nwith tan \u03b2 = 50 and m1\/2 <\u223c 600 GeV, in particular for positive values of A0. The LHC will\n4We are grateful to A.

At the tree level, the two CP-even Higgs boson masses are obtained as a\nfunction ofMZ , the CP-odd Higgs boson massMA, and tan\u03b2. In the Feynman-diagrammatic\n(FD) approach, which we employ here, the higher-order corrected Higgs boson masses are\nderived by finding the poles of the h,H-propagator matrix. This is equivalent to solving[\np2 \u2212m2h,tree + \u03a3\u02c6hh(p2)\n]\n\u00d7\n[\np2 \u2212m2H,tree + \u03a3\u02c6HH(p2)\n]\n\u2212\n[\n\u03a3\u02c6hH(p\n2)\n]2\n= 0 , (27)\nwhere the \u03a3\u02c6(p2) denote the renormalized Higgs-boson self-energies, and p is the external\nmomentum.\n17\nFor the theoretical prediction of Mh we use the code FeynHiggs [56, 57], which includes\nall numerically relevant known higher-order corrections. The status of the incorporated\nresults for the self-energy contributions to eq. (27) can be summarized as follows. For the\none-loop part, the complete result within the MSSM is known [71\u201373]. Concerning the\ntwo-loop effects, their computation is quite advanced, see Ref. [74] and references therein.\nThey include the strong corrections at O(\u03b1t\u03b1s) and Yukawa corrections at O(\u03b12t ), as well\nas the dominant one-loop O(\u03b1t) term, and the strong corrections from the bottom\/sbottom\nsector at O(\u03b1b\u03b1s). For the b\/b\u02dc sector corrections also an all-order resummation of the tan\u03b2 -\nenhanced terms, O(\u03b1b(\u03b1s tan \u03b2)n), is known [75, 76]. Most recently, the O(\u03b1t\u03b1b) and O(\u03b12b)\ncorrections have been derived [77]. 5\nThe current intrinsic error ofMh due to unknown higher-order corrections and its prospec-\ntive improvement in the future have been estimated to be [74,79]\n\u2206M intr,currenth = 3 GeV, \u2206M\nintr,future\nh = 0.5 GeV. (28)\nThe estimated future uncertainty assumes that a full two-loop result, leading three-loop and\npossibly even higher-order corrections become available.\nConcerning the parametric error on Mh, the top-quark mass has the largest impact,\nentering \u221d m4t at the one-loop level. As a rule of thumb, an uncertainty of \u03b4mt = 1 GeV\ntranslates to an induced parametric uncertainty in Mh of \u2206M\nmt\nh \u2248 1 GeV [80]. We find for\nthe parametric uncertainties induced by the present experimental errors of mt and \u03b1s\n\u03b4mcurrentt = 4.3 GeV \u21d2 \u2206Mpara,mt,currenth \u2248 4 GeV, (29)\n\u03b4\u03b1currents = 0.002 \u21d2 \u2206Mpara,\u03b1s,currenth \u2248 0.3 GeV.

(32)\nThus, the intrinsic error would be the dominant source of uncertainty in the future. On the\nother hand, a further reduction of the unknown higher-order corrections toMh is in principle\npossible.\nThe experimental accuracy onMh at the ILC [2] will be even higher than the prospective\nprecision of the theory prediction,\n\u03b4M exp,futureh = 0.05 GeV. (33)\n5Furthermore, a two-loop effective potential calculation has been carried out in Ref. [78], but no public\ncode based on this result is available.\n18\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nm1\/2 [GeV]\n100\n110\n120\n130\nM\nh \n[G\neV\n]\nCMSSM, \u00b5 > 0\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = 0\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = +m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = -m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = +2 m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = -2 m1\/2\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nm1\/2 [GeV]\n100\n110\n120\n130\nM\nh \n[G\neV\n]\nCMSSM, \u00b5 > 0\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = 0\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = +m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = -m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = +2 m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = -2 m1\/2\nFigure 8: The CMSSM predictions for Mh as functions of m1\/2 with (a) tan \u03b2 = 10 and\n(b) tan \u03b2 = 50 for various A0. A hypothetical experimental value is shown, namely Mh =\n120 GeV. We display an optimistic anticipated theory uncertainty of \u00b10.2 GeV, as well\nas a more realistic theory uncertainty of \u00b10.5 GeV and the current theory uncertainty of\n\u00b13 GeV.\nWe show in Fig. 8 we show the for Mh, assuming a hypothetical measurement at Mh =\n120 GeV. Since the experimental error at the ILC will be smaller than the prospective\ntheory uncertainties, we display the effect of the current and future intrinsic uncertainties. In\naddition, a more optimistic value of 200 MeV is also shown. The figure clearly illustrates the\nhigh sensitivity of this electroweak precision observable to variations of the supersymmetric\nparameters (detailed results for Higgs boson phenomenology in the CMSSM can be found in\nRef. [81]). The comparison between the measured value ofMh and a precise theory prediction\nwill allow one to set tight constraints on the allowed parameter space of m1\/2 and A0.\n3.7 The Higgs boson branching ratios\nWithin the CMSSM, various Higgs boson decay channels will be accessible at the LHC and\nthe ILC. At the LHC, Higgs boson couplings [82] or ratios of them [83,84] can in general be\ndetermined at the level of \u223c 10% at best, depending on the Higgs-boson mass and theoretical\nassumptions. Therefore we concentrate on ILC measurements and accuracies.\n19\nIt has been shown in Ref. [85] that the observable combination\nr \u2261\n[\nBR(h\u2192 bb\u00af)\/BR(h\u2192WW \u2217)\n]\nMSSM[\nBR(h\u2192 bb\u00af)\/BR(h\u2192WW \u2217)\n]\nSM\n(34)\nof Higgs boson decay rates is particularly sensitive to deviations of the MSSM Higgs sector\nfrom the SM. Even though the experimental error on the ratio of the two branching ratios\nis larger than that on the individual ones, the quantity r has a stronger sensitivity to MA\nthan any single branching ratio.\nFor the evaluation of BR(h\u2192 bb\u00af), we use the results of Ref. [86], including the result of\nresumming the contributions of O((\u03b1s tan\u03b2)n) [75,76]. The evaluation of BR(h\u2192 WW \u2217) is\nbased on an effective-coupling approach, taking into account off-shell effects. The corrections\nused for the effective-coupling calculation are the same as for the Higgs-boson mass calcula-\ntion, including the full one-loop and leading and subleading two-loop contributions [56, 74].\nThe evaluation has been performed with FeynHiggs [56, 57].\nFor the prospective accuracy at the ILC, we consider two cases. At the ILC with\n\u221a\ns =\n500 GeV an accuracy of 4% seems to be feasible [2], whilst at\n\u221a\ns = 1 TeV this accuracy\ncould be improved to [87] (\n\u03b4r\nr\n)exp,future\n= 1.5%. (35)\nSince in this ratio of branching ratios many theoretical uncertainties cancel, we assume that\nthe future theoretical error can be neglected. In the analysis in Sect. 5 we use the accuracy\nof eq. (35).\nIn Fig. 9 the results for r are shown as functions of m1\/2 for tan \u03b2 = 10, 50. In the figure\nwe indicate accuracies of both 4% and 1.5%. For low tan\u03b2, the high ILC accuracy in r will\nallow one to detect a deviation from the SM prediction for all CMSSM points. For large\ntan \u03b2, the effects of the supersymmetric contributions to r are in general smaller. Deviations\nup to m1\/2 \u2248 1 TeV could be visible, depending somewhat on A0.\n4 Combined Sensitivity: Present Situation\n4.1 Best fits for WMAP strips at fixed A0\nWe now investigate the combined sensitivity of the four low-energy observables for which\nexperimental measurements exist at present, namelyMW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , (g\u22122)\u00b5 and BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3).\nSince only an upper bound exists for BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212), we discuss it separately below.

The experimental uncertainties,\nthe intrinsic errors from unknown higher-order corrections and the parametric uncertainties\nhave been added quadratically, except for BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3), where they have been added linearly.\nAssuming that the four observables are uncorrelated, a \u03c72 fit has been performed with\n\u03c72 \u2261\nN\u2211\nn=1\n(\nRexpn \u2212 Rtheon\n\u03c3n\n)2\n. (36)\nHere Rexpn denotes the experimental central value of the nth observable, so that N = 4 for\nthe set of observables included in this fit, Rtheon is the corresponding CMSSM prediction\nand \u03c3n denotes the combined error, as specified above. We have rejected all points of the\nCMSSM parameter space with either Mh < 113 GeV [88,89] or a chargino mass lighter than\n103 GeV [90].\nThe results are shown in Fig. 10 for tan\u03b2 = 10 and tan\u03b2 = 50. They indicate that,\nalready at the present level of experimental accuracies, the electroweak precision observables\ncombined with the WMAP constraint provide a sensitive probe of the CMSSM, yielding\ninteresting information about its parameter space.

The upper plot\nshows the results for tan \u03b2 = 10, and the lower plot shows the case tan\u03b2 = 50.\n22\nvery good description of the data, resulting in a remarkably small minimum \u03c72 value. The\nfit shows a clear preference for relatively small values of m1\/2, with a best-fit value of about\nm1\/2 = 300 GeV. The best fit is obtained for A0 \u2264 0, while positive values of A0 result in a\nsomewhat lower fit quality. The fit yields an upper bound on m1\/2 of about 600 GeV at the\n90% C.L. (corresponding to \u2206\u03c72 \u2264 4.61).\nThese results can easily be understood from the analysis in Sect. 3. For tan\u03b2 = 10, the\nCMSSM prediction with m1\/2 \u2248 300 GeV is very close to the experimental central values\nof MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff and (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 for all values of A0, see Figs. 3\u20135. Also, BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) is well\ndescribed form1\/2 \u2248 300 GeV and A0 \u2264 0, while large positive values of A0 lead to a CMSSM\nprediction for BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) which is significantly below the experimental value. Consequently,\nin the case of tan\u03b2 = 10, a very good fit quality is obtained form1\/2 \u2248 300 GeV and A0 \u2264 0.6\nSome of the principal contributions to the increase in \u03c72 when m1\/2 increases for tan \u03b2 = 10\nare as follows. For A0 = \u2212m1\/2, m1\/2 = 900 GeV, we find that (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 contributes about\n5 to \u2206\u03c72, MW nearly 1 and sin\n2 \u03b8eff about 0.2, whereas the contribution of BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) is\nnegligible. On the other hand, for A0 = +2m1\/2, which is disfavoured for tan\u03b2 = 10, the\nminimum in \u03c72 is due to a combination of the four observables, but (g\u2212 2)\u00b5 again gives the\nlargest contribution for large m1\/2.\nFor tan \u03b2 = 50 the overall fit quality is worse than for tan\u03b2 = 10, and the sensitivity to\nm1\/2 from the precision observables is lower. This is related to the fact that, whereas MW\nand sin2 \u03b8eff prefer small values of m1\/2 also for tan\u03b2 = 50, as seen in Figs. 3 and 4, the\nCMSSM predictions for (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 and BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3) for high tan\u03b2 are in better agreement\nwith the data for larger m1\/2 values, as seen in Figs. 5 and 6. Also in this case the best fit is\nobtained for negative values of A0, but the preferred values for m1\/2 are 200\u2013300 GeV higher\nthan for tan\u03b2 = 10.\nIn Figs. 11\u201314 the fit results of Fig. 10 are expressed in terms of the masses of different\nsupersymmetric particles. Fig. 11 shows that for tan\u03b2 = 10 the best fit is obtained if the\nlightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which within the CMSSM is the lightest neutralino,\nis lighter than about 200 GeV (with a best-fit value \u223c 100 GeV). The best-fit values for the\nmasses of the lighter chargino, the second-lightest neutralino (recall also that m\u03c7\u02dc+\n1\n\u2248 m\u03c7\u02dc0\n2\n),\nboth sleptons and the lighter stau are all below 250 GeV, while the preferred region of the\nmasses of the heavier chargino and the heavier neutralinos is about 400 GeV.

The minimum\n\u03c72 for the other masses is shifted upwards compared to the case with tan \u03b2 = 10. The best-\nfit values are obtained in the region 400\u2013600 GeV. Correspondingly, these sparticles would\nbe harder to detect. At the ILC with\n\u221a\ns <\u223c 1 TeV, the best prospects would be for the\nproduction of \u03c7\u02dc01\u03c7\u02dc\n0\n2 or of \u03c4\u02dc1\u00af\u02dc\u03c4 1. Other particles can only be produced if they turn out to be\non the light side of the \u03c72 function.\nIn Fig. 13, 14 we focus on the coloured part of the supersymmetric spectrum and the\nHiggs mass scale. The case of tan\u03b2 = 10 is shown in Fig. 13. The top row shows the two\nscalar top masses, the middle row displays the two scalar bottom masses, and the bottom\nrow depicts the gluino mass and MA. All the coloured particles should be accessible at the\nLHC. However, among them, only t\u02dc1 has a substantial part of its \u03c7\n2-favoured spectrum below\n500 GeV, which would allow its detection at the ILC. The same applies for the mass of the\nA boson.\nFinally, in Fig. 14 we show the same masses in the case of tan \u03b2 = 50. All the particles\nare mostly inaccessible at the ILC, though the LHC has good prospects. However, at the\n90% C.L. the coloured sparticle masses might even exceed \u223c 3 TeV, which would render\ntheir detection difficult. Concerning the heavy Higgs bosons, their masses may well be\nbelow \u223c 1 TeV. In the case of large tan \u03b2, this might allow their detection via the process\nbb\u00af\u2192 bb\u00afH\/A\u2192 bb\u00af \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 [91].\n4.2 Scan of the CMSSM Parameter Space\nWhereas in the previous section we presented fits keeping A0\/m1\/2 fixed, we now analyse the\ncombined sensitivity of the precision observables MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) and (g\u22122)\u00b5 in a\nscan over the (m1\/2, A0) parameter plane. In order to perform this scan, we have evaluated\nthe observables for a finite grid in the (m1\/2, A0, m0) parameter space, fixing m0 using the\nWMAP constraint. As before, we have considered the two cases tan \u03b2 = 10 and tan \u03b2 = 50.\nDue to the finite grid size, very thin lines in the (m1\/2, A0) plane for tan\u03b2 = 50, see Fig. 2,\ncan either be missed completely, or may be represented by only a few points.\nFig. 15 shows the WMAP-allowed regions in the (m1\/2, A0) plane for tan\u03b2 = 10 and\ntan \u03b2 = 50. The current best-fit values obtained via \u03c72 fits for tan\u03b2 = 10 and tan \u03b2 = 50\nare indicated. The coloured regions around the best-fit values correspond to the 68% and\n90% C.L. regions (corresponding to \u2206\u03c72 \u2264 2.30, 4.61, respectively).\nFor tan \u03b2 = 10 (upper plot of Fig. 15), the precision data yield sensitive constraints on\nthe available parameter space form1\/2 within the WMAP-allowed region.

The 90% C.L. region contains all the WMAP-allowed A0 values in\nthis region of m1\/2 values. As expected from the discussion above, the best fit is obtained\nfor negative A0 and relatively small values of m1\/2. At the 68% C.L., the fit yields an upper\nbound on m1\/2 of about 450 GeV. This bound is weakened to about 600 GeV at the 90%\nC.L.\nAs discussed above, the overall fit quality is worse for tan\u03b2 = 50, and the sensitivity\nto m1\/2 is less pronounced. This is demonstrated in the lower plot of Fig. 15, which shows\nthe result of the fit in the (m1\/2, A0) plane for tan\u03b2 = 50. The best fit is obtained for\nm1\/2 \u2248 500 GeV and negative A0. The upper bound on m1\/2 increases to nearly 1 TeV at\nthe 68% C.L.\nThe holes in the coverage of the (m1\/2, A0) plane arise from the finite grid size of the\nscanning procedure, as mentioned above. They would be filled if our scan would also pick up\nthe very thin lines, especially the wisps arising from \u03c4\u02dc1\u00af\u02dc\u03c4 1 \u2192 H . Thus, the holes correspond\nto an extremely fine-tuned part of the parameter space, and are sparsely populated but not\nempty.\nIn Fig. 16 we analyze the prospects for the Tevatron to observe the process Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212.\nWe show the regions of the parameter space that are favoured at the 68% or 90% C.L., as a\nresult of our fits to the precision observables described above for tan \u03b2 = 10 and tan \u03b2 = 50.\nThe dotted line corresponds to our estimate of the final Tevatron sensitivity at the 95% C.L.\nof 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22128, see Sect. 3.5. It can be seen that, even for tan\u03b2 = 50, all parameter points\nresult in a prediction for BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) that is below our estimate of the future Tevatron\nsensitivity at the 95% C.L. Only with the more optimistic estimate of 2\u00d7 10\u22128 at the 90%\nC.L., discussed above, could a part of the favoured region for tan\u03b2 = 50 be probed. The\nLHC, on the other hand, will cover the whole CMSSM parameter space.\n5 Combined Sensitivity: ILC Precision\n5.1 Best fits for WMAP strips at fixed A0\nWe now turn to the analysis of the future sensitivities of the precision observables, based on\nthe prospective experimental accuracies at the ILC and the estimates of future theoretical\nuncertainties discussed in Sect. 3. As before, we first display our results as functions of m1\/2\nmoving along the WMAP strips with fixed values of A0 and tan\u03b2. We perform a \u03c7\n2 fit\nfor the combined sensitivity of the observables MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , (g \u2212 2)\u00b5, BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3), Mh\nand BR(h \u2192 bb\u00af)\/BR(h \u2192 WW \u2217). We do not include BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) into our fit.

The assumed future\nexperimental central values of the observables have been chosen such that they correspond\nto the best-fit value of m1\/2 in Fig. 10 for each individual value of A0. Thus, the minimum\nof the \u03c72 curve for each A0 in Fig. 17 occurs at \u03c7\n2 = 0 by construction. The comparison\nof the prospective accuracies at the ILC, Fig. 17, with the present situation, Fig. 10, shows\na big increase in the sensitivity to indirect effects of supersymmetric particles within the\nCMSSM obeying the current WMAP constraints. For the example shown here with best-fit\nvalues around m1\/2 = 300 GeV (upper plot, tan\u03b2 = 10), it is possible to constrain particle\n31\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\nm1\/2 [GeV]\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n\u03c72\n \n(fu\ntur\ne, \nM h\n, \nBR\n in\ncl.\n)\nCMSSM, \u00b5 > 0\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = 0\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = +m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = -m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = +2 m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 10, A0 = -2 m1\/2\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\nm1\/2 [GeV]\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n\u03c72\n \n(fu\ntur\ne, \nM h\n, \nBR\n in\ncl.\n)\nCMSSM, \u00b5 > 0\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = 0\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = +m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = -m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = +2 m1\/2\ntan\u03b2 = 50, A0 = -2 m1\/2\nFigure 17: The results of \u03c72 fits based on the prospective experimental accuracies for the\nprecision observables MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , (g \u2212 2)\u00b5, BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3), Mh and Higgs branching ratios\nat the ILC are shown as functions of m1\/2 in the CMSSM parameter space with the current\nWMAP constraints for tan\u03b2 = 10 (upper plot) and tan\u03b2 = 50 (lower plot).

Fig. 18 shows the fit results for tan \u03b2 = 10, whilst\nFig. 19 shows the tan \u03b2 = 50 case.\nIn each figure we show two plots, where the WMAP-allowed region and the best-fit point\naccording to the current situation (see Fig. 15) are indicated. In both plots two further\nhypothetical future \u2018best-fit\u2019 points have been chosen for illustration. For all the \u2018best-fit\u2019\npoints, the assumed central experimental values of the observables have been chosen such\nthat they precisely coincide with the \u2018best-fit\u2019 points7. The coloured regions correspond to\nthe 68% and 90% C.L. regions around each of the \u2018best-fit\u2019 points according to the ILC\naccuracies.\nThe comparison of Figs. 18, 19 with the result of the current fit, Fig. 15, shows that the\nILC experimental precision will lead to a drastic improvement in the sensitivity to m1\/2 and\nA0 when comparing precision data with the CMSSM predictions. For the best-fit values of\nthe current fits for tan \u03b2 = 10 and tan\u03b2 = 50, the ILC precision would allow one to narrow\ndown the allowed CMSSM parameter space to very small regions in the (m1\/2, A0) plane.\nThe comparison of these indirect predictions for m1\/2 and A0 with the information from the\ndirect detection of supersymmetric particles would provide a stringent test of the CMSSM\nframework at the loop level. A discrepancy could indicate that supersymmetry is realised in\na more complicated way than is assumed in the CMSSM.\nBecause of the decoupling property of supersymmetric theories, the indirect constraints\nbecome weaker for increasing m1\/2. The additional hypothetical \u2018best-fit\u2019 points shown in\nFigs. 18, 19 illustrate the indirect sensitivity to the CMSSM parameters in scenarios where\nthe precision observables prefer larger values of m1\/2.\nFor tan \u03b2 = 10, we have investigated hypothetical \u2018best-fit\u2019 values for m1\/2 of 500 GeV,\n700 GeV (for A0 > 0 and A0 < 0) and 900 GeV.

For m1\/2 =\n700 GeV and m1\/2 = 900 GeV, the 90% C.L. region extends up to the boundary of the\nWMAP-allowed parameter space for m1\/2. Even for these large values of m1\/2, however, the\nprecision observables (in particular the observables in the Higgs sector) still allow one to\nconstrain A0.\nFor tan \u03b2 = 50, where the WMAP-allowed region extends up to much higher values of\nm1\/2\n8, we find that for a \u2018best-fit\u2019 value of m1\/2 as large as 1 TeV, which would lie close to\nthe LHC limit and beyond the direct-detection reach of the ILC, the precision data would\nstill allow one to establish an upper bound on m1\/2 within the WMAP-allowed region. Thus,\nthis indirect sensitivity to m1\/2 could give important hints for supersymmetry searches at\nhigher-energy colliders. For \u2018best-fit\u2019 values of m1\/2 in excess of 1.5 TeV, on the other hand,\nthe indirect effects of heavy sparticles become so small that they are difficult to resolve even\nwith ILC accuracies.\n6 Conclusions\nWe have investigated the sensitivity of precision observables, now and at the ILC, to indirect\neffects of supersymmetry within the CMSSM. We have taken into account the constraints\nfrom WMAP and other astrophysical and cosmological data which effectively reduces the\ndimensionality of the CMSSM parameter space.\nWe have performed a \u03c72 analysis based on the present experimental results of the observ-\nables MW , sin\n2 \u03b8eff , (g\u22122)\u00b5 and BR(b\u2192 s\u03b3) for two values of tan \u03b2, taking into account the\ncurrent theoretical uncertainties. For tan\u03b2 = 10, we find that the CMSSM provides a very\ngood description of the data. A clear preference can be seen for relatively small values of\nm1\/2, with a best-fit value of about 300 GeV and A0 \u2248 \u2212m1\/2. This result can be understood\nfrom the separate analyses of each of the observables, each of which is well described by the\nCMSSM prediction for m1\/2 \u2248 300 GeV. At the 90% C.L., we find an upper bound on\nm1\/2 of about 600 GeV. The supersymmetric particle spectrum corresponding to the best-fit\nregion contains relatively light states. They should be detectable at the LHC [83] and the\nILC [2], allowing a detailed determination of their properties [92].\nFor tan\u03b2 = 50, the quality of the fit is worse than for the case with tan\u03b2 = 10. While\nMW and sin\n2 \u03b8eff prefer small values of m1\/2 also for tan\u03b2 = 50, (g \u2212 2)\u00b5 and BR(b \u2192 s\u03b3)\nare better described in this case by larger m1\/2 values. The indirect constraints on m1\/2 are\n8We notice again the sparsely-populated \u2018voids\u2019 due to our coarse sampling procedure.\n36\ntherefore less pronounced for tan\u03b2 = 50. The best-fit value is obtained for m1\/2 \u2248 500 GeV\nand negative A0. The best-fit values for the LSP mass and the lighter stau are still below\nabout 250 GeV, while the preferred mass values of the heavier neutralinos, the charginos and\nthe other sleptons are in the region of 500 GeV. The 90% C.L. regions of these masses extend\nbeyond 1 TeV, but would be kinematically accessible at a multi-TeV linear collider [93].\nColoured particles, such as the stops and sbottoms and the gluino are likely to have masses\nwithin the reach of the LHC. However, at the 90% C.L. also masses beyond \u223c 3 TeV are\npossible. Heavy Higgs bosons might also be accessible at the LHC in the case of large tan\u03b2.\nWe have investigated the implications of our fit results for the prospects for detecting\na signal for BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212). For both tan\u03b2 = 10 and tan\u03b2 = 50, we find that the 90%\nC.L. region for m1\/2 and A0 leads to predicted values of BR(Bs \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212) that are below our\n95% C.L. estimate of the Tevatron sensitivity at the end of Run II. With a more optimistic\nestimate, the Tevatron could probe a part of the parameter region for tan \u03b2 = 50 at the\n90% C.L. It seems more likely, however, that detection of this process would have to await\nLHC data.\nIn the second part of our analysis, we have investigated the future sensitivities of the pre-\ncision observables to indirect effects of supersymmetry, assuming the experimental accuracies\nachievable at the ILC with a low-energy option running at the Z resonance and the WW\nthreshold and estimating the future theoretical uncertainties. As further precision observ-\nables besides the ones discussed for the present situation, we have included the mass of the\nlightest CP-even Higgs boson and the ratio of branching ratios BR(h\u2192 bb\u00af)\/BR(h\u2192WW \u2217).\nWe have chosen several points in the (m1\/2, A0) plane of the CMSSM with the current\nWMAP constraints as examples for \u2018best-fit\u2019 values, adjusting the assumed future exper-\nimental central values of the precision observables to coincide with the predictions of the\n\u2018best-fit\u2019 values. With the prospective ILC accuracies, the sensitivity to indirect effects of\nsupersymmetry improves very significantly compared to the present situation. We find that\nfor assumed \u2018best-fit\u2019 values of m1\/2 <\u223c 500 GeV the precision observables allow one to con-\nstrain tightly m1\/2 and A0. Comparing these indirect predictions with the results from the\ndirect observation of supersymmetric particles will allow a stringent consistency test of the\nmodel at the loop level.\nBecause of the decoupling property of supersymmetric theories, the indirect constraints\nbecome weaker for largerm1\/2. Nevertheless, useful limits onm1\/2 and A0 can be obtained for\n\u2018best-fit\u2019 values ofm1\/2 as high as 1 TeV. Thus, the indirect sensitivity from the measurement\nof precision observables at the ILC may even exceed the direct search reach of the LHC and\nILC.\n37\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank R. Clare, G.
