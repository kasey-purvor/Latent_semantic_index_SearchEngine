Introduction \n \nThe major recent impetus in the development of electronic theses (e-theses) in the UK \nhas come about via  funding made available by the Joint Information Systems \n 2\nCommittee (JISC). Looking at the strategic aims of JISC, it is clear that access to e-\ntheses is relevant in a number of areas, in particular improving the effectiveness of \nscholarly communication, promoting wider participation (perhaps by encouraging a \nnew generation of students interested in creating theses of a non-traditional, non-\nlinear nature), and sustaining a dynamic world class research sector. If research is \navailable more easily, more widely and more quickly, then this will have a positive \neffect on dynamism in the research environment. \n \n2. Electronic theses at Cranfield University - background \n \nAs an almost wholly postgraduate institution, the creation of, and access to, new \nresearch is of central importance at Cranfield University. The vast majority of \nstudents are engaged in the creation or development of new research \u2013 over 90% of \nstudents are postgraduates and consequently have to submit a thesis. As a \nconsequence, for a number of years the Library and Information Service (LIS) has \nbeen involved in the development of electronic thesis availability both locally and \nnationally. \n \nCranfield was a founder member in the mid-1990s of the University Theses Online \nGroup (UTOG), a loosely assorted group of librarians from a number of very different \nhigher education institutions in the UK interested in widening access to this research \nmaterial. The group was not funded in any way until later in its life (when very \nlimited funding was made available) but it served as an essential first step in \nencouraging communication and in the forging of relationships that would later \nbecome important (Lomax, 1997).  \n \nBetween 1994 and 1997 the Cranfield LIS, as a partner in the European Initiative in \nLibrary and Information in Aerospace (EURILIA) project, was involved in a limited \nthesis scanning project (http:\/\/www.cordis.lu\/libraries\/en\/projects\/eurilia.html). \nFunded under the European Commission\u2019s Action Programme for Libraries the \nproject developed a Z39.50 client to allow the searching of partners\u2019 different online \nlibrary catalogue systems (O\u2019Flaherty, 1995). Where a relevant thesis record was \nretrieved from the Cranfield catalogue, users could click a link allowing them to \naccess the full text of over 200 scanned PhD or prize-winning MSc theses.  \n \nCranfield LIS was also involved in a pilot project in 2001 in collaboration with Index \nto Theses, which tested a mechanism for the uploading of both thesis metadata and \nfull text. This was a limited project that provided very useful experience for all \ninvolved and although successful, has not been developed into a service. \n \nIt was in 2002 that JISC, realising that theses provided a largely untapped wealth of \ninformation, funded three projects relevant to the development of e-theses in the UK \nunder the Focus on Access to Institutional Resources (FAIR) programme \n(http:\/\/www.jisc.ac.uk\/index.cfm?name=circular_1_02). These were: \n\u2022 Electronic Theses (http:\/\/www2.rgu.ac.uk\/library\/e-theses.htm) led by The \nRobert Gordon\u2019s University (RGU) in Aberdeen. This project involves a \nconsortium of organisations developed initially through contact within UTOG; \n\u2022 Theses Alive (http:\/\/www.thesesalive.ac.uk\/) at Edinburgh University \n(MacColl, 2002, Andrew, 2004);  \n 3\n\u2022 Daedalus project (http:\/\/www.lib.gla.ac.uk\/daedalus\/) at Glasgow University \n(Ashworth et al., 2004). Daedalus is mainly a project on Institutional \nRepositories, but  there is a theses \u2018strand\u2019. \nCranfield University, along with the University of Aberdeen, the British Library and \nthe University of London is a member of the consortium of the Electronic Theses \nproject.  It  had been keen to move to electronic thesis submission and it was felt that \nby being involved in a collaborative project and developing local procedures at the \nsame time, each would benefit. \n \n3. Why e-theses? \n \nIn general terms there may be a number of local reasons why universities wish to \nmove into the development of, and provide access to, electronic theses collections. \nSpace has always been at a premium in many libraries, although with the development \nof e-journals and with library policies of providing access to electronic only journals, \nas well as the gradual increasing access to electronic books, space is being made \navailable elsewhere.  \n \nIt is unlikely to be the main driver and it may not be the case at many institutions, but \nmoving to e-thesis submission may allow the overhaul, rationalisation and \nstreamlining of administrative thesis submission processes within university \nregistries. \n \nThe main reason for moving to e-theses at Cranfield is to try and ensure that a huge \nuntapped information resource is made available more widely. In the past, theses have \nsat on the shelves gathering dust and since  cataloguing may have been limited or of \npoor quality, these resources were all but invisible to the researcher. Suleman and \nothers (2001), of Virginia Tech in the US,  describe the development of the  \nNetworked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) which is a \ncollaborative effort of universities around the world to promote creating, archiving, \ndistributing and accessing Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs). \n \nOther arguments given for e-theses development include the idea that such a \ndevelopment will benefit graduate education in terms of graduates understanding the \ndeveloping world of electronic publishing, copyright, intellectual property and so on. \nAnother important push is that students may wish to develop new ways of creating \naccess to their research \u2013 they may wish to create an electronic work for which there \ncould be no paper equivalent. This may affect all kinds of disciplines from the arts \n(e.g. performance, or artistic design) to engineering with the embedding of computer \nprograms or models. \n \nAlthough not one of the main reasons, an important by-product of the creation and \navailability of electronic theses at Cranfield has been the input into the development \nof the University\u2019s institutional repository. \n \n \n4. Setting up an e-theses collection at Cranfield University \n \n4.1 First steps \n \n 4\nThe initial steps at Cranfield started with desk research, looking at various Web sites \nin the US, where a number of universities have been accepting electronic theses for \nmany years. There is also useful information on the various ETD conference Web \nsites at: \n\u2022 Brigham Young University, Utah in 2002 (http:\/\/ce.byu.edu\/cw\/etd2002\/)  \n\u2022 Humboldt University, Berlin in 2003 (http:\/\/www.hu-berlin.de\/etd2003\/ ) \n\u2022 University of Kentucky in 2004 (http:\/\/www.uky.edu\/ETD\/ETD2004\/). \nThese Web sites have links to papers describing all aspects of the development of \nelectronic theses. \n \nThe next step was to make contact with stakeholders at the University and to draft a \nfeasibility study for submission to Teaching Committee. The proposal was accepted in \nFebruary 2002 and an invitation given to return to the same committee in November \n2002 where complete proposals and submission recommendations would be \nconsidered. \n \nAs soon as the initial proposal was accepted, the LIS took on the further responsibility \nof forming a Working Group to investigate all aspects of e-thesis submission in detail. \nClearly the membership of such a group was important to its success and to its \nauthority. It was felt that it was essential that a number of stakeholders were involved.  \n \nAs the holder of theses and the service that had the aim of further disseminating \nuniversity research, the LIS took on the lead role of chairing the group. Other services \ninvolved were: \n\u2022 the Registry, the owners of the submission process; \n\u2022 the Computer Centre for its expertise in training, software and format advice;  \n\u2022 Cranfield Press for its knowledge of publishing, scanning and so on. \nSo with central services well represented and with input from the President of the \nStudents Association, the final and most important representation and input would be \nprovided by a member of academic staff on the Working Group. \n \n \nOne of the most important factors was to ensure that the group worked within certain \nterms of reference. At a couple of stages there was a danger of discussions moving \ninto more general areas of thesis submission and it was felt that the role of the group \nshould be kept relatively narrow. Suggestions on changing or rationalising \nbibliographic reference formats, for example, were felt to be outside the remit of the \ngroup. Obviously \u2018terms of reference\u2019 can be defined at the start and so if an \ninstitution wishes to look at all areas of submission, then this may be an opportunity \nto re-engineer the whole process, as long as this is made clear to the reporting \ncommittees at the outset. Where an issue was felt to be important but impossible to \nanswer in the working group, it was referred back to Faculty Boards for discussion. \n \n \n4.2 Software decisions \n \nIt may well be important to address the software question as a first step. At Cranfield, \nthe initial idea was to take the two most mature open source, Open Archives Initiative, \nProtocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) compliant systems available at the time \n\u2013 the Virginia Tech (VT) e-theses software and the GNU e-prints software from \n 5\nSouthampton - and compare them with what was at the time a new IR software \nsolution, DSpace, developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and \nHewlett Packard (HP). Each system has different advantages and disadvantages \ndepending on institutional requirements. In the end, at Cranfield, there was simply no \ntime to undertake such a piece of detailed research as had been planned and so the \ndecision was based on a number of core issues.  \n \nThe VT software was designed for e-theses. At Cranfield it had always been a \npossibility (and part way through the planning process it became a certainty) that it  \nwould be necessary in the future to think about adding other types of material to the \nsystem, so clearly software designed for a single type of resource was not an ideal \nsolution. DSpace quite clearly had a significant amount of funded development \nbehind it, and it was perceived to be a more advanced system than the other main \ncontender \u2013 GNU e-prints. The preservation issue had also been considered in the \ndevelopment of DSpace. Just as Cranfield was making a local decision on which to \nchoose, independently, the FAIR projects had all largely come to a similar conclusion, \nand although in a couple of cases there was a wider remit to look at other solutions, \nDSpace was clearly the leading contender and the favoured choice by the technical \nteams.  \n \nJones (2004) reports on the similarities and differences discovered between the VT \nsoftware and  DSpace as part of the Theses Alive project, and Nixon (2003) describes \nexperiences in using Southampton\u2019s e-prints software and DSpace in the Daedalus \nproject.  \n \n4.3 Workflow \n \nAt Cranfield one of the decisions at the outset was that the LIS would be responsible \nfor loading electronic thesis metadata to the server (reflecting the fact that the LIS is \ncurrently responsible for cataloguing theses on the library management system). \nDirect student upload to a server was discussed within the working group (of the sort \ntrialled in the Index to Theses pilot). It was assumed that this would be the eventual \nmethod of receiving electronic theses, but at this first stage, prior to the adaptation of \nthe workflow within the DSpace software, it was felt that the Library should have \nresponsibility for cataloguing. \n \nA related question is: at what stage is the e-thesis to be submitted? Should it be \nsubmitted up front prior to the marking, or should it be required at the end of the \nprocess once all corrections have been completed. The difficulty with the first method \nis that in the vast majority of cases, the copy of the thesis submitted is different from \nthe copy of the thesis that is eventually passed.  If there are different versions how do \nyou manage version control? It was felt that at this stage, the need for version control \nwould simply add to the complexity of a new process. One comment made during \ndiscussions was that there was simply no utility in having a copy that wasn\u2019t the final \ncopy (assuming that academic staff  were still going to mark paper copies of theses).  \n \n4.4 Timeframe and article publishing \n \nWhat is the proposed timeframe for making the theses live and accessible? Relevant \nhere is the issue of the publication of thesis-based articles. There is US evidence that \n 6\npublishers rarely refuse publication of an article based on an electronically available \nthesis. \n \nIn an article on the issues of whether Web availability of theses counted as prior \npublication, McMillan (2001) reports that the conclusions of a survey carried out at \nVirginia Tech found that \u201c100% of those who had successfully published had not had \nany problems getting published because their theses or dissertations were online and \nreadily available on the Internet\u201d. Certainly, according to surveys carried out by \nSeamans (2001) of Virginia Tech and Dalton (2000) of the University of Windsor, \nCanada, some publishers do see ETDs as constituting \u2018prior publication\u2019, although in \nDalton\u2019s case only 14% stated they would not publish works derived from ETDs, \nwhile 82% of Seamans\u2019 respondents said that they would be willing to publish such \nwork. Interestingly, some publishers (Elsevier, Academic Press) encourage their \nauthors to link from their journal articles to personal Web sites. \n \nText from the specification for electronic thesis submission for graduate students at \nJohns Hopkins University (http:\/\/etd.jhu.edu\/etdpublic\/howto\/publisher.html) states:  \n\u201cit is the extremely rare dissertation that is published as a book without major \nrevisions. Most authors spend several years rewriting and developing the ideas and \nargument in their dissertation. The more your book manuscript differs from the \ndissertation, the less it will matter to the publisher whether or not the original \ndissertation is available electronically. Where the dividing line is at which the original \ndissertation becomes irrelevant is a matter of judgment for each individual publisher, \nbut it is probably wise to assume that by making your dissertation widely available \nelectronically you are somewhat raising the threshold of acceptance for that later book \nmanuscript.\u201d  \n \n4.5 Cataloguing and metadata \n \nIt is likely that, as well as loading electronic theses into a separate repository (whether \njust for theses, or for more general institutional material), a library will also wish to \ncontinue to make them available within the standard library catalogue \u2013 this is \ncertainly the case at Cranfield. Given that the most sensible approach would be to \ndownload from one to the other, a decision has to be made whether to initially create a \nrecord on the catalogue or in the repository. In the Cranfield case, and probably for all \nother DSpace users, it makes more sense to create the DSpace record first, because, as \npart of the creation process, DSpace creates a persistent URL in the form of a \n\u2018handle\u2019. This decision will mean harvesting metadata from DSpace for loading into \nthe library management system used at Cranfield, namely the Sirsi Unicorn system. \n \nA significant outcome from the Electronic Theses project led by RGU was the \ncreation of a core set of metadata for e-theses (Electronic Theses, 2002). Other fields \nare also specified as being optional. Clearly it is essential that fields for both \ncatalogue and repository systems should be borne in mind when creating the standard \nrecord. \n \nHow will metadata be collected if LIS staff are to be undertaking the cataloguing \nprocesses? At Cranfield, the idea of the creation of a \u2018thesis documentation page\u2019 as \nshown in Figure 1, came from experience of collecting technical reports.  \n \n 7\nTake in Figure 1 \n \nFigure  1 Thesis documentation page \n \n \n \nThe thesis documentation page  brings together all descriptive data about the thesis. \nUse of such forms will help the cataloguer to avoid having to do the equivalent of \nleafing through an electronic document trying to find all required cataloguing \n 8\ninformation and will have the added benefit of students being asked to supply free-\ntext subject keyword terms. If libraries are considering the use of more controlled \nsubject terms, then this is something that needs to be considered further, i.e. who will \nprovide these controlled terms, could a relevant thesaurus be made available for \nstudents to use? \n \n4.6 Plagiarism, format checking, copyright \n \nWhere a thesis is made available electronically, it will now be possible to run it \nthrough plagiarism software. This is something that an institution will wish to do far \nin advance of the final award, so once again would need to be fitted into the \nworkflow. Cranfield is just beginning to look at integrating this process although it is \nmore likely to be done during marking by academic staff (where academic staff may \nhave asked the student for their own e-copy of a thesis to help facilitate this process). \nAnother issue - it is important to ensure that the workflow for restricted theses is \neffective in ensuring that such works remain out of the public domain until the expiry \nof the restriction. \n \nAt some stage in the process the thesis will need to be checked for formatting (such as \nreferences format, margins). A cursory check (cursory because students should have \nbeen made aware of the legal issues already) for third party copyright material may be \nworthwhile here. At Cranfield, these issues can be addressed by looking at the paper \ncopy submitted up front, but clearly if a different submission model is chosen, then \nthis will need to be considered. In terms of permissions for making the thesis widely \navailable, in common with a number of other universities, Cranfield holds the \ncopyright on student theses and so the licensing issues are less onerous than they may \nbe at other institutions. \n \nIs there a process by which problems with PDF conversion can be identified? The \nsolution at Cranfield was to request a copy in the native word-processing format, so \nthat where a converted file failed to open or had pages missing, then a new conversion \ncould be undertaken after the student had left the University. In fact a brief pilot \nundertaken at Cranfield showed that technical issues were unlikely to be \nproblematical. \n \nPerhaps the easiest method of filling an e-thesis repository is to undertake a \nretrospective scanning process. Often this is difficult (or rather, more expensive) \nwhere the thesis has been bound, but there are some institutions (for example the New \nJersey Institute of Technology) that scan new, unbound theses. This is one method of \nensuring that the thesis that was submitted, marked and corrected, is the same as the \nelectronic copy that is made available. At Cranfield, most of the e-theses available \nwere acquired in electronic format, but in a few cases, theses were also scanned.  \n \n4.7  Timescales \n \nCranfield first started to look seriously at the development of e-theses submission \nprocesses in late 2001 and finally had the Senate minutes confirming the rule change \nin July 2004. It is common sense that those responsible for steering through such \nchanges need to be aware of which official committees need to be consulted and \npersuaded of the merits of such a change. It almost goes without saying that it is also \n 9\nimportant to consider and develop unofficial channels and personal contacts in order \nto ensure academic support.  \n \nThere also needs to be an acceptance that, even though there is general agreement \nabout the concepts, there is liable to be lengthy discussion about the detail, and a need \nto re-visit the same committees throughout the process. It is almost inevitable that \nthere will be delays in the progress - speed may well depend on the institutional \nculture and whether the idea has reached the collective psyche of the university. \n \n4.8  Firm decisions \n \nThere were a number of agreed outcomes for Cranfield: \n \n\u2022 The current thesis submission workflow would not change until right at the \nend of the process when students would be mandated to submit an electronic \ncopy of their amended and corrected thesis. Students will continue to submit \nthree paper copies. \n\u2022 Submission will be mandatory for all research degrees (PhD, DBA, EngD, \nMPhil, Masters by research).  \n\u2022 Initially students will be advised to submit to the Registry a PDF copy of their \nthesis on CD-ROM (i.e. something physical, therefore easier to see and \nmanage).  \n\u2022 Library staff will be responsible for submitting e-theses to the server.  \n \nThe Library is due to report back to the various committees on any issues or \ndifficulties that are raised. \n \n4.9 Usage \n \nOne problem with the availability of usage statistics is that when you really need \nthem, at the start of the process when they would be really useful for advocacy, they \njust don\u2019t exist! At Cranfield, usage figures quoted were from institutions in the US. \nAt Virginia Tech, e-theses were 100x more likely to be circulated than the paper \nequivalent (Moxley, 2001); at West Virginia University access to theses increased a \nstaggering 145,000% - from 813 issues in 1998\/99 to 1,181,111 accesses in 2003 \n(Hagen, 2003). \n \nHigh use of an e-thesis server may encourage academics to engage further with e-\nprints and the development of institutional repositories, particularly where it can be \nillustrated that material within a DSpace system can be retrieved not just via the \n\u2018standard\u2019 Google but also by Google Scholar (which limits searching specifically for \nscholarly literature, including peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, preprints, abstracts \nand technical reports from all broad areas of research). In Figure 2 a search of Google \nfor information on \u201chumic rich waters\u201d results in a match with a thesis in the \nCranfield University system as shown in Figure 2. \n \n \nFigure  2. Google search showing retrieval of Cranfield thesis  \n \n 10\n \n \nBy clicking on the link from within Google, a user is taken to the item record within \nDSpace at Cranfield as shown in Figure 3.  \n \nFigure 3. Simple DSpace item record display \n \n 11\n \n5. Institutional repository \n \nAnother issue that needs to be considered (probably early in the e-thesis submission \nchange process) is whether the institution is to hold e-theses alone, or whether the \nsame system will be developed into an institutional repository (IR) with a wider \ncollection development policy. At Cranfield e-theses were used as the first set of \nmaterial for QuePrints@Cranfield the University IR. Access to e-theses can be used \nas part of the advocacy for populating a more general e-prints repository. At the \nmoment (early 2005), QuePrints@Cranfield contains 47 electronic theses obtained \nvoluntarily from students. Once loaded, and once a persistent URL has been \ngenerated, alumni students are notified that an e-copy of their work is available. Also \nat this stage, an e-mail is sent to thesis supervisors so that they too are aware that the \nwork is available and can be linked from their own Web page. As part of this e-mail, \nthere is also continuation text describing the development of the University IR, text \nwhich encourages the supervisors to consider providing their own pre-prints for \naddition to the server. Whether this works or not immediately is not necessarily the \nissue \u2013 it is designed as a method of advocacy so that when Cranfield really does start \nto pursue staff more seriously for papers, they have at least been made aware of local \ndevelopments \u2013 again this is the acceptance that advocacy is a gradual process. \n \nHopefully authors of e-theses who eventually join the academic staff will already \nunderstand the benefits provided by e-theses and will be more fully engaged with the \nidea of IRs. \n \n6. Main issues for academic staff \n \nThere were a number of issues that arose in official committees that had to be \naddressed. \n \n\u2022 One issue that has arisen in many institutions is a concern over quality of non-\nresearch degree theses. This issue also arose at the UTOG conference held at \nUCL in 1997 when an academic made the point that many Masters level \ntheses, even if they were original, were only the beginnings of research and \nwere probably not worth making generally available. The decision at Cranfield \nwas to concentrate on research degree theses and to revisit Masters level \ntheses once the initial change had been running for a period. \n \n\u2022 One issue that could have been important was one of Intellectual Property \nRights (IPR), and the issue of giving away research. One question that was \nasked during the process was whether the possibility of making electronic \ntheses available would lead to an increase in the number of theses that were \nrestricted. \n \n\u2022 As aforementioned, the serious issue of plagiarism was also debated in a \nnumber of meetings although generally it was accepted that the availability of \nan electronic copy of a thesis is more likely to ensure that plagiarism is more \neasily detectable. \n \n 12\n\u2022 An issue accepted right at the beginning of the process was that for the \nforeseeable future academics will only mark theses on paper and this puts \nclear limitations on the submission workflow. \n \n\u2022 Another central issue was the definition of the \u2018copy of record\u2019. Clearly if the \nUniversity Library is no longer collecting paper theses then this is not an issue, \nbut where the University still wishes to collect, bind and shelve paper copies \nof theses, in addition to making electronic copies available, a decision needs to \nmade as to which is the \u2018copy of record\u2019. \n \n\u2022 Related to this (and again it depends on collection policies as to whether this is \na problem), how do you ensure that the paper copy sitting on the shelf is \nexactly the same as the electronic copy available on the server? This is quite a \ndifficult issue if you are dealing with paper and electronic copies separately. It \nis yet to be seen whether this is likely to be a problem at Cranfield but there \nare a number of safeguards in place. First, a student will be required to sign a \nform to confirm that the two are the same. Second, it is hoped that at the least \ncorrections can be checked between the two copies. The third and possibly \nmost important safeguard is that it simply isn\u2019t in the students\u2019 interest to get \nthis wrong. Clearly where this is done by mistake, there needs to be some \nmethod by which differences can be identified. Although this is not drawn to \nthe attention of users specifically, there is currently a message on \nQuePrints@Cranfield saying that: \u201cIn all cases the bound paper thesis is the \ncopy of record\u201d. \n \n7. Conclusions \n \nIn conclusion, the choice at Cranfield was to take a pragmatic stepped approach which \nit is hoped will change and develop further in the future. The important aspect was to \nensure that the concept of submission of electronic theses was accepted as a general \nprinciple. The path itself was one of least academic resistance in that the submission \nand marking process for academic staff did not change at all and for the Registry only \nchanged slightly at the very end of the process (apart from the need to amend one or \ntwo official letters). Theses are initially provided by students in the same way, and \nthey are marked and corrected in the same way. The copy of record remains the paper \ncopy. In the future it may well be the case that a model will be developed such that a \nthesis is submitted electronically, copies are printed for marking, corrected and a final \ncopy is submitted again and loaded to the server by the student. It is useful right at the \nstart to consider where you wish to get to and so when developing initial proposals \nCranfield has also been developing a methodology for moving from submission of e-\ntheses to e-submission of theses. It is likely that over the next few years submission \nprocesses will be developed and refined and so ensuring that the infrastructure can \ndeal with these future developments is essential. \n \nReferences  \n(All URLs in this paper were checked 8th January 2005) \n \nAndrew, T.
