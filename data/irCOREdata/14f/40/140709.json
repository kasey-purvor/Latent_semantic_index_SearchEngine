The sampling method is based on the\nadsorption of formaldehyde from the air and reaction with \uf062-diketones (for example\nacetylacetone) in a sol-gel matrix to produce a yellow product, lutidine, which was detected\ndirectly. The proposed method does not require preparation of samples prior to analysis and\nallows both screening by visual detection and quantitative measurement by simple\nspectrophotometry. The detection limit of 0.03 ppmv formaldehyde is reported which is\nlower than the maximum exposure concentrations recommended by both the World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). This\nsampling method was found to give good reproducibility, the relative standard deviation at\n0.2 ppmv and 1 ppmv being 6.3 and 4.6 %, respectively. Other carbonyl compounds i.e.\nacetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acetone and butanone do not interfere with this analytical\napproach. Results are provided for the determination of formaldehyde in indoor air.\nKeyword: Formaldehyde; sol-gel; acetylacetone; spectrophotometry\n3Introduction\nFormaldehyde is one of the most important air pollutants in residential and industrial\noccupational environments. Formaldehyde can cause irritation to the eyes and nose, central\nnervous system damage, immune system disorders, blindness and respiratory disease [1, 2].\nAlthough, formaldehyde is toxic and allergenic, it is still widely used in industrial processes\ndue to its high reactivity and relatively low cost. Formaldehyde is used mainly in the\nproduction of urea, phenolic and melamine resins [3, 4]. These resins are used widely as\nadhesives and binders in the manufacture of building materials such as particle-board,\nplywood, furniture and other wood products, as well as raw materials for surface coatings [5,\n6]. All of these applications can lead to the release of formaldehyde within indoor\nenvironments [7].\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 2006) has classified\nformaldehyde as a human carcinogen [3] and the US Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA, 1999) has classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen [8]. Due to\nformaldehyde toxicity, the World Health Organization (WHO) has furthermore established\nlimits of exposure to formaldehyde at a maximum of 0.08 ppm averaged over 30 min. The\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has also set a permissible exposure\nlimit for formaldehyde of 0.75 ppm for an 8 hour workday.\nFor this reason, several analytical methods have been reported for formaldehyde\ndetermination including gas chromatography [9, 10], high-performance liquid\nchromatography [11], capillary electrophoresis [12], enzyme-based biosensors [13, 14, 15],\ngas sensors based on metal oxides [16, 17, 18] and piezoelectric sensors [19, 20, 21]. These\nmethods all however require expensive and laboratory-based apparatus, cannot undertake\nreal-time measurements and are able to only determine a single sample per test.\nFormaldehyde gas sensors and biosensors often furthermore lack the required selectivity [22].\n4Traditional methods to detect formaldehyde are based on either the collection of\nformaldehyde by active or passive sampling in cartridges impregnated with\n2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine [23, 24, 25] or are aqueous based [26] followed by the analysis of\nthe formed hydrazones by HPLC. These methods however require post sample preparation\nsteps and the acceptor solution can be subject to evaporation in high flow-rate air samples.\nThese methods can moreover all be prone to interfering species leading to loss of\nperformance of the sampling device. There is for these reasons a demand for a simple,\ninexpensive, and multi-sample detection method utilizing a solvent-free sorbent and sampling\n- without need of a pump.\nSpectrophotometric methods have been reported for formaldehyde detection using\nvarious sensing reagents such as chromotropic acid [28, 29, 30], pararosaniline [31],\n3-methyl-2-benzothiazolone hydrazone (MBTH) [32], 4-amino hydrazine-5-mercapto-1, 2,\n4-triazole (AHMT) [33] and bromate-Janus green [34], due to the ability to carry out simple\ncolourimetric tests [35]. Chromotropic acid, pararosaniline and MBTH are, however, prone to\ninterference by acetalydehyde [36] and provide poor limits of detection [37]. These reagents\nrequire moreover strongly acidic conditions which are not suitable for the development of a\nsolvent free device. Sensitive colourimetric methods based on the Hantzsh reaction between\nformaldehyde, \u03b2-diketones and ammonium acetate under mild conditions have been reported\n[38, 39, 40, 41], although the reported methods are usually solution based and not suitable for\npersonal sampling. Adsorption of these solutions into porous glass [40] has been utilized to\nprovide a heterogeneous solid-state colourimetric sensor which could be analysed\nspectroscopically.\nSol-gels are suitable as a support matrix in that they are homogeneous, provide a\nchemically and physically stable environment with excellent optical transparency - and these\nhave been used to entrap sensing reagents in aerogels [42, 43]. The sol-gel method is a room\n5temperature reaction in which a precursor alkoxide undergoes hydrolysis and condensation to\nform an optically transparent gel. During the gelling process, reagents can be entrapped\nwithin a polymeric network of the porous gel. This approach can therefore be applied to\nentrap sensitive reagents for formaldehyde determination while providing a transparent\nmatrix as well as being suitable for preliminary visual detection. Since the sol-gel initially is\nliquid in form before gelling, it can easily be cast into whatever shape or thickness is required\nand the resultant gels were also soft and pliable enough to be cut to any required size.\nIn this paper we describe the development of a simple and cost effective method for\nmonitoring of trace formaldehyde in air. The measurement was based on the diffusion of\nformaldehyde to react with acetylacetone entrapped within the sol-gel. The portable visual\nsampling device described here is solvent free and did not require post sample preparation\nsteps such as preconcentration and extraction. This paper reports on this method being used\nfor formaldehyde determination in air samples.\nThe sensor described measures cumulative dose of formaldehyde rather than a real\ntime instantaneous reading of formaldehyde concentrations. In high level environments\nformaldehyde can be measured by utilizing short exposure times whereas in lower level\nenvironments, the cumulative dose over, for example, a working day can be assessed. Since\nthe sensor response can be detected visually it can give a reasonably rapid response to high\nconcentrations. Over a day the chemical reaction giving rise to the colour change is\nessentially irreversible and by using spectrographic methods allows quantification of the\ncumulative dose due to continuous exposure to low levels of formaldehyde.\n62. Experiment\n2.1. Reagents\nFormaldehyde stock solution (1 mol L-1) was prepared by diluting 37 % w\/v solution\n(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). Standard working solutions were prepared daily by\nappropriate diluting of the stock solution in deionized water which was purified with a\nMilli-Q system (Millipore, USA).\nStock solutions of acetylacetone and methyl acetoacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,\nUSA) was prepared by dissolving 0.75 g of ammonium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,\nUSA), 0.2 mL of acetic acid solution (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK) and 0.02 mL\nacetylacetone\/methyl acetoacetate in 10 mL deionized water. These reagents were stored at\n4\uf0b0C in the dark to avoid darkening of the solution. This was recommended to allow visual\nscreening detection.\nTo evaluate the reaction of acetylacetone and methyl acetoacetate with formaldehyde,\n300 \u00b5L of reagent solution was placed in disposable cuvettes; formaldehyde solution was\nthen added to obtain a final concentration of 0.005, 0.01 or 0.02 mM of formaldehyde. The\nUV\/Vis absorbance was measured versus reaction time at 376 nm and 410 nm for methyl\nacetoacetate and acetylacetone, respectively. UV-Vis spectra were recorded using a\nUV-2101PC Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Results of this work are discussed in\nsection 3.1 and figure 2.\nTo investigate selectivity, 3 mmol L-1 solutions of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde,\nbenzaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), acetone and butanone (Fisher Scientific)\nwere prepared in deionized water. 10 \u00b5L of each solution was added into separate 300 \u00b5L\nacetylacetone solutions in disposable cuvettes. After 3 h, the absorbance was measured by\nscanning wavelength between 300 nm-550 nm. Results of this work are discussed in section\n3.5.\n72.2. Preparation of sol-gel formaldehyde sensors\nSol-gel solution was prepared by mixing tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (Merck,\nDarmstadt, Germany), 0.04 mol L-1 HCl solution and ethanol (HPLC grade; Fisher Scientific)\nin the ratio 2:1:2 (v\/v). The mixture was then magnetically stirred for 2 h at room\ntemperature. This solution was used as the stock sol-gel solution throughout.\nIn the present work, sol-gel formaldehyde sensors were prepared by mixing the\nsol-gel solution and acetylacetone solution in a 1:1 ratio. 300 \u00b5L of the resultant\nformaldehyde sensing solution was pipeted into 1.5 mL disposable cuvette with care being\ntaken that the solution did not adhere at the cuvette walls which would otherwise lead to\nvariable responses. The sol-gel mixture was left at room temperature for 30 min to give a\ncolourless gel containing entrapped acetylacetone . The sol-gel was stored in the freezer to\navoid the evaporation of any components. A reference sol-gel was prepared in the same time\nand stored under the same conditions for use as a blank sample for UV-visible determination.\n2.3. Standard gaseous formaldehyde\nTo obtain a calibration curve for formaldehyde vapour, standard gaseous formaldehyde\nwas generated according to the reaction described given by Dong and Dasgupta at 20\uf0b0C\n[44], where aqueous formaldehyde is used to generate equilibrium concentrations of\ngaseous formaldehyde Eqn 1.\nEqn 1: [HCHO(aq)] = 16650 [HCHO(g)]1.0798\nA range of diluted formaldehyde solutions were placed in 50 mL polypropylene\nexposure tubes to give the specified equillibrium concentrations of gaseous formaldehyde.\nThe relationship between the concentration of diluted formaldehyde aqueous solution and gas\n8phase formaldehyde concentrations is shown in Table 1. For exposure of sol-gel to\nformaldehyde, the sol-get was cast into the UV cuvette, allowed to set and then placed inside\nthe polypropylene tube (Fig. 1).\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Evaluation of the Reaction of acetylacetone and methyl acetoacetate with formaldehyde\nThe reactions of acetylacetone and methyl acetoacetate with formaldehyde were\ninvestigated to evaluate sensitivity. The reaction mechanisms are shown in Fig. 1. The\nreactions rate were investigated by adding three different concentrations of formaldehyde\nsolutions into 300 \u00b5L of acetylacetone or methyl acetoacetate solution to obtain 0.005, 0.01\nor 0.02 mmol L-1 formaldehyde concentrations. Both reactions were monitored with time and\nthe results show that acetylacetone reacts with formaldehyde faster than methyl acetoacetate\nunder the same conditions, the reaction being completed within 2 h and 6 h, respectively\n(Fig. 2). The UV spectrum (Fig. 2c) demonstrated the maximum adsorptions observed for the\nproducts of methyl acetoacetate and acetylacetone were found to occur at wavelengths of 376\nnm and 410 nm, respectively. A strong yellow colour was obtained when formaldehyde\nreacted with acetylacetone, whereas the product of reaction of formaldehyde with methyl\nacetoacetate provides a weaker yellow at the same concentration. This means that the\npresence of the ester groups cause a decrease in both reaction rate and yellow colouration.\nDue to the faster reaction and stronger colour with acetylacetone, this approach was chosen\nfor development of the visual approach for formaldehyde determination.\nIt has been previously noted [40] that the product of the acetylacetone formaldehyde\nreaction is not indefinitely stable but decomposes to a non-coloured product, albeit with a rate\nconstant some 100000 times less than that of the formation of coloured product. The stability\nof 3, 5-diacetyl-2, 6-dihydrolutidine (i.e the reaction product of acetyl acetone with\n9formaldehyde) in the sol-gel was investigated to evaluate and select a suitable sampling time.\nFig. 3 indicates that the product was stable for 6 h in daylight and exposed to the laboratory\natmosphere, with the absorbance decreasing after longer time. The decomposition was\nquicker when the product was exposed to light and conversely was slower in the dark. This is\napproximately what we would expect; the colour develops rapidly due to the reaction with\nformaldehyde and then a slow decrease caused by decomposition of the coloured product.\nThese results indicate that measurement should be made within a 6 h period to minimise the\ndecomposition of the product. Previous workers [40] gave longer stability times but their\nsamples were stored in sealed bags and it is not stated whether they were in daylight.\n3.2. Effect of reagent compositions\nEffects caused by the variation of the concentration of individual reagents i.e.\nacetylacetone, ammonium acetate and acetic acid concentration on sol-gel formaldehyde\nsensing was investigated. The studies were carried out by varying one parameter while\nkeeping other parameters constant. Acetylacetone solutions in the concentration range 1-80\nmmol L-1 were firstly prepared and mixed with sol-gel solution 1:1 (v\/v) to obtain clear sol-\ngels. These were pipetted into UV cuvettes whilst liquid and allowed to set. The cuvettes\nwere placed into 50 ml vials as described (section 2.3) along with aqueous solutions of\nformaldehyde. By choosing the correct concentration of solution, an equilibrium\nconcentration of 1 ppmv formaldehyde vapour was generated within the tube. The\nabsorbance was then measured after the exposure of the sol-gel to 1 ppmv gaseous\nformaldehyde for 6 h. The cuvettes were then from the tubes removed and measured using\nUV spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that the absorbance increased with increasing\nconcentration of acetylacetone up to 10 mmol L-1, after which time a greater concentration of\nacetylacetone did not lead to an increase in the observed absorbance. For these reasons 10\n10\nmmol L-1 of acetylacetone was selected for determination of formaldehyde up to a\nconcentration of 1 ppmv since concentrations of formaldehyde in the environment air are\ntypically lower than 1 ppmv.\nThe effects of ammonium acetate and acetic acid concentrations are shown in Fig. 4.\nIt was found that the absorbance increased with increasing ammonium acetate up to 1 mol L-1\nand that the absorbance decreased for concentrations of ammonium acetate in excess of 2 mol\nL-1. Formation of the sol-gel also depends on the concentration of ammonium acetate; the sol-\ngel was found to form more quickly with increased concentration of ammonium acetate (30\nmin at 1 mol L-1 of ammonium acetate). Higher concentration of ammonium acetate also\ncaused the sol-gel to become cloudy. The effect of concentration of the acetic acid shows that\nthe absorbance of exposed sol-gels increased with increasing the concentration up to 2 % and\nthat no further increase in absorbance was observed for higher concentration. Concentrations\nof 10 mmol L-1 acetylacetone, 1 mmol L-1 ammonium acetate and 2 % (v\/v) acetic acid were\ntherefore chosen for preparing sol-gel sensors for detection of formaldehyde up to 1 ppmv.\n3.3. Effect of the ratio of sol-gel solution to sensing reagent\nIn order to obtain the best formaldehyde sensing material, the ratios of sol-gel matrix\nmaterials and sensing reagents were optimized. Sol-gels are porous materials with porosity\ndepending on the ratio of solvent to precursor. The characteristics of sol-gel formaldehyde\nsensors prepared with different ratios of sol-gel solution to acetylacetone were therefore\ninvestigated. The sol-gel and 10 mmol-1 acetylacetone solution were mixed in ratios of 3:1,\n2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 (v\/v) \u2013 nitrogen gas was then passed though the mixed solution for 1\nmin to remove any bubbles that can form in the sol-gel. The sol-gel sensing solution was\nplaced in a 1.5 mL disposable cuvette and allowed to set to give a clear sol-gel. The sol-gels\nwere exposed to saturated formaldehyde vapour under the conditions described earlier. After\n11\nexposure to formaldehyde the sol-gels became yellow, allowing direct detection with UV\/Vis\nspectroscopy without any post exposure preparation. The spectral absorption plot (Fig. 5.)\ndemonstrated that lowering the ratio of acetylactone to sol-gel below 1:1 led to a decrease in\nresponse - probably due to lack of reagents diminishing the extent of reaction with\nformaldehyde. Increasing the ratio of acetylacetone above 1:1 also decreased the response;\nthis appears to be a diffusion based problem. A strong yellow band appeared at the surface of\nthe sol-gel indicating that all the reaction was taking place in the localized vicinity - rather\nthan evenly through the sol-gel. The placement of the cuvette inside the UV spectrometer and\nthe design of this equipment means that only the lower 2-3 mm of the sol-gel is actually\nmeasured. Therefore sensing time increases because the formaldehyde has to diffuse down\nthrough the upper part of the sol-gel to reach this active part and the high levels of\nacetylacetone slow this down because all the formaldehyde is consumed in the upper part of\nthe gel. At lower concentrations the reaction between the reagents is slower and enough\nformaldehyde manages to diffuse to the lower part of the gel to cause colour changes there as\nwell. Comparison between sol-gels and aqueous acetylacetone solution, indicated that the\nreaction in a 1:1 sol-gel and aqueous solution was not significantly different. The effect of\nsol-gel solution was also investigated by adding 10 \u00b5L of formaldehyde solution to 300\u00b5L of\nsol-gel sensing solution (sol-gel: acetylacetone, 1:1 v\/v) and aqueous acetylacetone solution.\nThe absorbance after 2 h. (Fig. 6.) showed that the formaldehyde reacts with acetylacetone in\nsol-gel without loss of sensitivity compared to aqueous sample.\nFig. 7. shows the absorbance change after exposing sol-gel sensors to 0.5 ppmv and\n1.0 ppmv of formaldehyde vapour for 1-6 h. The absorbance increased with increasing\nexposure time. Due to the rather limited stability of the product of reaction with\nacetylacetone, 6 h was selected as the standard sampling time. This period of time is also\n12\nconvenient for daily measurement. The sampling time can however be shortened for\nenvironments that contain high concentrations of formaldehyde, for application, for example,\nwithin the adhesive industry - so long as appropriate calibration is performed.\nThe volume of sol-gel sensing material on the response to formaldehyde vapour was\ninvestigated to allow the smallest volume which could provide measurable responses. The\nsol-gel material (0.3-1.0 mL) was dispensed into disposable cuvettes and exposed to\nformaldehyde vapour for 6 hours. The results indicated that a volume of 0.3 mL was optimal\nand that the absorbance decreased with higher volumes of sol-gel sensing material while\nlower volumes led to low reproducibility. For example when a 1 ml solution was utilised, a\nyellow band developed at the top of the sol-gel, probably as a result of a diffusion controlled\nreaction i.e the formaldehyde is being consumed before reaching the lower parts of the sol-\ngel sample. Small changes in the spectra were observed since the UV beam was effectively\npassing beneath the active portion of the gel. When volumes below 0.3 ml were used, low\nlevels of the sol-gel within the cuvette and the actual set-up of the UV spectrometer meant\nthat only a portion of the beam was passing through the sample. 0.3 mL was therefore\nselected for calibration purposes.\n3.4. Calibration curve, reproducibility and limit of detection\nCalibration curves of the response to formaldehyde vapour under optimum conditions\nin the concentration range 0.05-1.2 ppmv are shown in Fig. 8a. A linear relationship is\nobtained in this range (R2=0.996). Reproducibility of sol-gel sensors was investigated by\nmeasuring the absorbance of 15 sensors exposed to 0.2 and 1.0 ppmv of formaldehyde for 6\nh. The relative standard deviations were 6.3% and 4.6%, respectively (Fig. 8b).\nThe limit of detection was found to be 0.03 ppmv (calculated as three times standard\ndeviation of the blank signal (adsorption of sol-gel samples that have not undergone exposure\n13\nto formaldehyde) from 10 replicates divided by the slope of the calibration curve (3Sb\/m).\nThese results indicate that this method allows for the determination of formaldehyde levels in\nair lower that the limiting value by both World Health Organization (0.08ppm) and\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (0.75ppm).\n3.5. Investigation of interferences\nCarbonyl compounds e.g. aldehydes and ketones are common interfering substances\nfor determination of formaldehyde. The reaction of acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, acetone and\nbutanone with sol-gel sensors were therefore investigated. Our findings showed that\nacetylaldehyde gave 6.5 % of the response of formaldehyde at the same concentration (0.1 m\nmol L-1) and the other compounds gave \uf03c 3 % of the formaldehyde response \u2013 thereby\ndemonstrating a high selectivity for formaldehyde.\n3.6. Stability of sol-gel sensing\nThe stability of sol-gel sensors were evaluated by storage at-20 \uf0b0C, 4 \uf0b0C and 20 \uf0b0C\n(room temperature). The composition of the sol-gel was found to change depending on\ntemperature. The sol-gels were found to lose 3.7\u00b11.4 %, 46.4\u00b13.1% and 82.0\u00b10.5 % by\nweight after storing 1 week in the -20\uf0b0C, 4 \uf0b0C and 20\uf0b0C, respectively. However, sampling\ntime at room temperature for 6 h was not affected by the evaporation of the sol-gel\ncomponents. Storage of sol-gel at 20\uf0b0C for 1 day can cause a loss of 9.0\u00b10.7% by weight.\nThe shrinkage of sol-gel can cause variation of the spectral response due to poor contact\nbetween the sol-gel and the cuvette walls. However it could be seen by visual checking that\nthe colour changes still occurred. This results indicated that the stability of sol-gel sensors\nwere more affected by the initial sol-gel composition than by the loss of the sensing reagents.\n14\nStorage of sol-gel formaldehyde sensors in the freezer is therefore recommended to avoid the\nevaporation of the sol-gel components.\n3.7. Determination of formaldehyde in the air\nThe acetylacetone sol-gel entrapped material was evaluated for the determination of\nformaldehyde inside a cupboard. Four separate batches of five cuvettes containing\nacetylacetone entrapped sol-gel were placed inside new MDF cabinets for 6 h (MDF,\nespecially when new emits formaldehyde). After six hours the cuvettes were removed and the\nabsorbance at 410 nm determined by spectrophotometry. Since the reaction is cumulative, the\nabsorbance of the sol-gels could be related directly to the average formaldehyde\nconcentrations within the cabinet. Results as shown in Table 2 demonstrated that the average\nconcentrations of formaldehyde inside the cabinets varied between 0.13 and 0.25 ppmv and\nthere were good agreements seen between individual samples of the same batch (RSD\u2019s from\n6-12%).\n4. Conclusion\nA sol-gel based sensor with entrapped acetylacetone reagent is reported for the\ndetermination of formaldehyde in the air. The developed sensing device can be used as a\nqualitative and screening method for on site analysis in the presence of formaldehyde.\nAlthough not capable of giving the rapid response obtained from many semiconductor based\nsensors such as reviewed here [45], they are capable of measuring cumulative doses over, for\nexample, and 8 hour working day and can give faster responses in response to high levels of\nformaldehyde. The responses can be qualitatively observed visually, without the need for any\nequipment and if quantification is required this can be done by UV spectroscopy. The\nproposed method is simple, inexpensive, portable, contains no overly aggressive chemicals,\n15\nconsumes a small amount of low toxicity reagent, operates at room temperature and requires\nno post sample preparation. Moreover, this method was found to offer good selectivity,\nsensitivity and reproducibility. Potential applications for this include as an exposure badge,\nsimilar to the radiation counter badges used by workers in the nuclear industry. Alternatively\nthe sol-gels could be used in remote optical sensors where they are connected via optical\nfibres to a centrally located spectrometer.\nAcknowledgements\nThis project was supported by The Royal Golden Jubilee PhD Program (RGJ) supported by\nthe Thailand Research Fund.
