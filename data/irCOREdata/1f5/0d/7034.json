It provided\na unique opportunity for lecturers, courseware developers, library staff, computing\nsupport staff, educational development staff and institutional managers to meet and\ndiscuss the effective implementation of educational technology. Space has allowed only a\nsmall selection of the papers presented to be included in this special issue of ALT-J\ndevoted mainly to the conference, but these papers address the major issues discussed.\nEnabling active learning through the use of educational technology requires students to\nhave adequate access to computers and training in using them, lecturers to have the\nconfidence and skills necessary for using technology in their courses, and - crucially -\nsenior managers in institutions of higher education to take a proactive role in supporting\ninnovation in teaching and learning, both financially and by adopting appropriate staff-\nsupport policies. Real learning occurs when students are motivated, when they create,\npractise and synthesize, and are given feedback on their progress. Such activities require\ninputs, processing and outputs - hence active learning. These issues were addressed at the\nconference in an attempt to tease out the unique benefits of using educational technology\nin teaching and learning, and to identify winning strategies. However, it is not sufficient\nonly to focus on the opportunities for successful learning. It is also necessary to consider\ncost: cost in terms of software development, staff training, and the investment required in\nhardware. Unfortunately, too few papers at the conference measured the benefits of\neducational innovations and the associated costs. This is a serious shortcoming when it is\nnecessary to persuade senior management in institutions of higher education to allocate\nscarce resources - probably away from research - to support innovations in teaching and\nlearning. This is a far from easy task in light of the current funding drivers in UK\nuniversities and the widely-held view that strong research leads to high-quality teaching.\nThe latter view is supported by the recent THES analysis which suggested a strong\n3\nEditorial\ncorrelation between a research-assessment rating of 5 and an excellent HEFCE teaching-\nquality assessment (whatever the underlying reasons for the correlation).\nWe therefore need to be very clear about the real benefits of using technology in teaching\nand learning. Computer-aided assessment, for example, can be used not only to ensure\nobjectivity in course-end examinations, but also to provide feedback to students on their\nprogress. The latter is becoming increasingly difficult with the large classes now\ncommonly found in the first year of many degree programmes. Computer-mediated\ncommunication can provide better contact between staff and students. Improved\ncommunications also provide opportunities for sharing information and teaching\nmaterials on a world-wide basis. Simulations can expose students to situations which\nwould otherwise be difficult if not impossible to set up on account of cost, inaccessibility,\nscale, danger, time or ethics, and offer the potential to reduce costs through replacement\nof real but expensive laboratory exercises. Some of the papers in these proceedings discuss\nthese benefits.\nClearly emerging from the conference was the enormous enthusiasm of the majority of\ndelegates for the undoubted potential of educational technology. However, enthusiasm\nfor it, and a deep belief in its benefits, are not sufficient. Senior management in\ninstitutions of higher education need to be persuaded with pragmatic arguments if they\nare to agree to go down a technological route and adequately reward staff for their\nefforts. One of the problems confronting the innovator in justifying technological\ninnovation is the difficulty of estimating costs in advance of implementation, but this\nshould not stop developers monitoring the costs, nor lecturers measuring the benefits\nretrospectively. Such evidence is crucial for ensuring long-term investment in the\napplication of educational technology in teaching and learning, and for developing a\nmature partnership between senior management and educational technologists.\nGabriel Jacobs\nSimon Heath (Conference Chair and Guest Joint Editor), University of Aberdeen\n4\n"}
