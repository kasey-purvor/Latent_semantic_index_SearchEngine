Introduction \n \nThixoforming is a forming process that shapes metal components in their \nsemisolid state.  Prior to forming, the microstructure of the alloy consists preferably of \nsolid metal spheroids in a liquid matrix, which can be difficult to achieve with hot-\nworked, high alloy steels prone to strong segregation bands.  Alloy slurry with a non-\ndendritic microstructure is said to be in a thixotropic state (from the Greek words of \nthixis which means \u2018the act of handling\u2019 and trope meaning \u2018change\u2019), whereby the \ninternal structure of the material is changed by an external load.  If an alloy in this state \nis sheared, this will result in a fall in its viscosity and it will flow like a liquid, but if \nallowed to stand it will thicken again.  The behaviour of this type of slurry, which is \nacting like a non-Newtonian fluid, was first discovered by Spencer et al [1] and has \nsince led to extensive work on the thixotropy of alloy slurries [e.g. reference 2]. \n \nOn thixoforming of high temperature materials, one major attraction of \nthixoforming such materials, e.g. steels, is the low forging force involved during \nthixoforming as compared to that in conventional forgings [3].  This means that more \nintricate and complex shapes can be formed faster with some reduction in forming steps \nand with near net shaping capabilities [3-6].  Other major advantages include prolonged \ndie life due to less thermal shock (forging below liquidus as against castings), weight \nsavings in components with less porosity than conventionally, plus improved usage of \nfeedstock materials because of improved designs [7-8]. \n \nThe work described in this paper is the result of development in the semi-solid \nprocessing of a high melting point alloy: a high performance HP9\/4\/30 steel having a \ntypically banded starting microstructure.  The development of its microstructure in the \nsemi-solid state is discussed.  The thixoforming induction heating trials and the \nresulting load-displacement signals of the thixoformed products are explained. \n \n \n2. Experimental procedure \n \n2.1  Material \n \nThe high performance HP9\/4\/30 steel used was produced by a vacuum arc \nremelting (VAR) process and rolled at 1250-1310\u00b0C.  The high temperature of rolling is \nto achieve homogenisation in the ingot.  It was subsequently normalised at 899-927\u00b0C \n(air cooling to room temperature), hardened by heating to 843\u00b0C (oil or water \nquenched) and refrigerated at -73\u00b0C (warming in air to room temperature), double \ntempered at 538\u00b0C and lastly double annealed at 677\u00b0C (air cooling) and 621\u00b0C (air \ncooling), according to an AMS 6526C standard [9].  Its chemical composition is \ncompared to the standard in Table 1. \n \n2.2 Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) \n \nDTA analysis was carried out to estimate the solidus, liquidus and liquid fractions \nwithin the semi-solid zone of the supplied material.  The alloy was cut into small pieces \nof 70-90mg weight for DTA tests using a Perkin Elmer Differential Thermal Analyser \nDTA7.  Alumina of about 100mg weight was used as the reference material.  The \nheating rate employed was 20\u00b0C per minute.  The heating was carried out in an argon \natmosphere to prevent oxidation.  Some examples of DTA-measurements on \ndetermination of the solidus, liquidus and liquid fractions within the semi-solid zones of \na few steel grades can be found in [10]. \n \n2.3 Partial remelting experiments \n \nThe partial remelting experiments were carried out in order to gain some insight \ninto the microstructural development of the starting material when in the semi solid \nstate.  These can be used to estimate relationships between microstructure, cell size and \nshape, and holding time at a given temperature of the material; hence to establish a \nsuitable condition for thixoforming.  Here, a direct remelting route was employed, that \nis, partial remelting was carried out straight from the as-received condition.  The as-\nreceived billet was cut into coupons of approximately 5x10x12mm.  The tests were \ncarried out using a vertical high temperature quench Carbolite tube furnace, capable of \nreaching a maximum temperature of 1500\u00b0C.  The set-up is shown in Fig. 1.  An R-type \nthermocouple was placed inside a hole located on the 5x10mm surface of the coupon (5-\n6mm deep), to ensure that the sample had reached the predefined quenching \ntemperature, and hung inside the furnace.  After the predetermined holding time, the \nsample was immersed into the quencher.  To ensure that the sample is cooled rapidly, its \ndimensions must be kept to a minimum while at the same time having enough strength \nin the mushy state [11] to provide the presence of thick walls around the thermocouple \ninside the thermocouple hole.  A coupon thickness of 5mm was found suitable for the \npurpose.  The selected temperatures were 1430, 1450, 1460 and 1470\u00b0C (within the \nsemi solid zone \u2013 based on the DTA) at various holding times of 2, 4, 8 and 16 minutes.  \nThe heating was carried out in an argon atmosphere to reduce oxidation as this is one of \nthe major issues with thixoforming of steel at high temperatures.  The use of protective \natmospheres has also been adopted by other authors in order to avoid excessive high \ntemperature oxidation [12,13]. \n \n2.4 Image analysis \n \nThe microstructural characterisation was carried out using KS-400 Imaging System \nRelease 3.0 software connected to a Reichert-Jung Polyvar MET optical microscope.  \nThe grain or cell size was measured adopting the Mean Lineal Intercept method as \noutlined in ASTM E112-96 standard [14] while volume estimation of liquid fraction \nwas carried out adopting automatic image analysis as outlined in ASTM E1245-95 \nstandard [15] using ImageJ 1.28u, a commercially available image analysis software \npackage.  Unless otherwise stated, all samples were etched using 5% Nital (5ml HNO3 \n+ 95ml methanol or ethanol). \n \n2.5 Thixoforming heating trials \n \nThixoforming heating trials were carried out in order to determine the conditions \nrequired for a successful thixoforming.  A slug of 40mm diameter and 40mm length was \nused and the heating was by means of an induction system having a current frequency \nof 1000Hz and a maximum power capacity of 120kW, with the induction coil having a \ndiameter of 130mm.  The trials were carried out using the thixoforming press at the \nUniversity of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.  The schematic diagram of the \npress is shown in Fig. 2.  The slug was placed on a non-metallic extension (pedestal) on \nthe ram in the thixoformer and raised to the heating position in the centre of the coil.  \nThe top and bottom surfaces of the slug were both insulated with a layer of Kaowool \npad of approximately 2mm thick.  Kapranos et al. [16] had shown that this procedure \nreduced heat losses and gave a more uniform temperature distribution in the slug during \nheating.  Temperature profiles during the heating trials were monitored using R-type \nthermocouples which were inserted right at the centre and near the edge of the slug as \nshown in Fig.3.  Various heating sequences were experimented with.  A three step \nheating sequence of 24kW for 6 minutes, 96kW (1 \u00bd minutes), and 91.2kW (2 minutes) \nwas finally adopted prior to forming.  The temperature-time-capacity profiles of the \nheating cycle are shown in Fig. 4 (a). \n \nThere are several issues associated with temperature measurement and control \nduring the heating trials.  The first is the accuracy of the temperature measurement; this \nis \u00b11\u00b0C.  The second issue is control of temperature around the identified process \ntemperature.  This proved to be quite challenging with this material and the high \ntemperatures involved.  It will be shown in the Results and Discussion section that, \nalthough the desired process temperature was 1470\u00b0C, the temperature, at half a minute \nor longer soak times, actually varied between 1470 and 1480\u00b0C.  This was related to \nradiation losses experienced by the slug and is discussed in section 3. \n \nThe third issue is the reproducibility of a temperature profile given an identical \nheating schedule.  Fig.4 (b) shows two runs with identical heating schedules.  The \nslopes during the heating up stages are almost identical.  The range (1470 - 1480\u00b0C) on \nthe plateau is also identical.  Reproducibility at the plateau stage is linked with the \nsecond issue.  \n \n 2.6 Thixoforming \n \nThixoforming was carried out using the press, insulating pads and slugs of identical \nsize to that mentioned above.  The press has the capacity of producing a 100kN load \nduring forging and is able to transfer a slug of material to be injected into a die at a \nmaximum velocity of 1000mm\/s.  It is controlled by a computer equipped with a \nServotest DCS 2000 digital control system. The data collection acquisition rate is up to \n2kHz.  Load-displacement signals during forging were obtained from a pressure \ntransducer sensing hydraulic fluid pressures exerted by the ram.  The signals obtained \nare collected by the computer controller and easily transferred into Microsoft Windows \nExcel software for analysis.  For the monitoring of temperature, the measurement of the \ntemperature with thermocouples could not be easily integrated in the gas chamber \nduring thixoforming.  As a result, instead of depending on the temperature-capacity, \nsubsequent thixoformings were carried out based on time-capacity of the induction \nheating schedule established in the heating trials. \n \nFor the selection of the die materials for thixoforming of steels, it is known that \nconventional hot working tool steel dies may soften at temperatures of around 600\u00b0C \n[17].  Work on thixoforming of high temperature materials had been carried out using \nvarious die materials and concepts, including graphite, ceramics (e.g. sindanyo and \nalumina) and composite die concepts consisting of multiple materials [5,17,18].  \nGraphite dies were used in this work because they can be easily and cheaply prepared.  \nFurthermore, they had already been shown to be successful in thixoforming of some \nhigh temperature materials [19].  The dies were housed in a split steel die box and \nclamped at the top of the press.  They produced finger-like thixoforgings of 60 mm \nlength and 10 mm by 18 mm section, which could be machined into specimens for \ntensile testing.  The slug was heated in an argon gas environment to reduce oxidation.  \nThe optimisation was carried out in terms of die filling velocity (of 350-1000mm\/s), \ndwell time (90-180s) (at a final load of 100kN) and hold time (0-2 minutes) at \nprocessing temperatures of between 1470 and 1480\u00b0C.  In this paper, a forging carried \nout immediately when the slug has just reached 1470\u00b0C is considered as a \u2018thixoforming \nat 1470\u00b0C at zero minute soak\u2019.  Forgings carried out after a hold of 0.5, 1 and 2 \nminutes at a \u2018process temperature\u2019 of 1470\u00b0C (which, in practice, meant in the range \n1470 \u2013 1480\u00b0C, see earlier) are described as \u2018thixoforming in the range 1470-1480\u00b0C at \n0.5, 1 and 2 minutes\u2019 respectively. \n \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \n3.1  Starting material \n \nAn optical micrograph of the as-received high performance HP9\/4\/30 steel is \nshown in Fig. 5.  The ingot had been subjected to rolling at 1250-1310\u00b0C.  The high \ntemperature was to assist in achieving some homogenisation in the ingot.  A complex \nheat treatment process had also been applied, that is, normalising, hardening, \nrefrigerating, double tempering and annealing at temperatures and conditions as \nmentioned in section 2.1.  The complex microstructure shown by the material is related \nto this complex heat treatment history.  The longitudinal surface (shown in Fig. 5) \nshows some evidence of banding along the longitudinal direction of the ingot.  The \nbanding originates from the microsegregation in the primary dendritic structures of the \noriginal ingot during the VAR process [20].  The rolling has then led to directionality in \nthis microsegregation.  Homogenisation and the heat treatment process involved will \nhave reduced the microsegregation effect but the alloy contains high levels of slowly \ndiffusing elements and therefore full homogenisation is impractical.  The longitudinal \nbanding observed is typical for these materials in normal commercial practice and \nconforms to the acceptable standard in the longitudinal banding examination mentioned \nin an EMS96247 standard [21].  The microstructure of the starting material consists of a \nmixture of lath and tempered martensites, and a fraction of retained austenite in \nmartensitic matrix [22-24].  The grain size is predominantly 60-80\u00b5m with occasional \ngrains of about 120\u00b5m (revealed when etched with Vilella\u2019s reagent), which conform to \nthe AMS6526C standard [9]. \n \n3.2 Microstructural development during partial remelting. \n \nPrior to the partial remelting experiments, DTA analysis was carried out to estimate \nthe solidus, liquidus and liquid fractions within the semi solid zone of the supplied \nmaterials using the set-up mentioned above.  The DTA results are shown in Fig. 6. The \nliquid fraction curve indicated a steep increase in liquid fraction values between 1460 \nand 1480\u00b0C.  The solidus is estimated at 1425\u00b0C and the liquidus at 1500\u00b0C, while 20% \nand 50% liquid correspond to 1455\u00b0C and 1470\u00b0C respectively.  Note that thixoforming \nis normally carried out at fraction liquid between 20-50% [7,25,26].  The estimation of \nthe solidus and liquidus temperatures and also the liquid fraction at various \ntemperatures in the semi solid zone, is helpful in determining the temperatures for the \nisothermal re-heating tests in the semi solid zone.  The quenched coupons from the \nremelting tests could be used to assess further the liquid fraction against temperature.  \nFraction liquids at different temperatures at 16 minutes holding time from image \nanalysis are also shown in Fig. 6.  The liquid fraction underestimation by the image \nanalysis as compared to the DTA is due to insufficient cooling rate to instantaneously \nfreeze the microstructure, resulting in further solidification of liquid on the solid phase. \n \nFig. 7 is a micrograph from the coupon that was heat treated to 1430\u00b0C and held for \n2 minutes.  Representative optical micrographs of the microstructural evolution with \nincreasing temperatures and holding times are shown in Figures 8 \u2013 10.  Only the \nmicrographs at 2 and 8 minutes holding times are shown here.  \n \nThe microstructures at 1430\u00b0C (i.e. at a temperature just above solidus) show some \ndistinct polygonal grains.  Thin liquid films are seen on grain boundaries but no \nliquation is obvious at the microsegregation bands.  The size of these polygonal cells at \n2 minutes holding is 455 \u00b1 40 \u00b5m.  At 1450\u00b0C, the polygonal structure is less obvious, \ni.e. sharp edges and straight lines of the grain boundaries have diminished.  Liquation is \nseen not only on grain boundaries but also on microsegregation bands.  The grain size at \n2 minutes holding is 338 \u00b1 40 \u00b5m.  This is about two thirds of the size at 1430\u00b0C at 2 \nminutes holding.  The reduction in size could be the result of the liquated bands (which \nare absent at 1430\u00b0C), leading to some smaller truncated grain structures at 1450\u00b0C.  At \n1460\u00b0C, major liquation is seen to occur at the bands rather than at grain boundaries.  \nThese liquated bands are again seen at certain places (e.g. in Fig. 9 (b)), breaking up the \nprimary cells producing smaller truncated grains.  Grains from re-solidified liquid \nduring the quench are also seen particularly within bigger bands such as in Fig. 9 (a).  \nBecause of the non-homogeneous nature of the bands, a homogeneous grain structure \ncould not be achieved across the material.  Similar observation is seen at 1470\u00b0C as at \n1460\u00b0C.  Major liquation occurs at the microsegregation bands, and these bands when \nseen in transverse section could form interconnected networks with each other and with \nentrapped liquid pools within the grains to produce smaller grains.  A great amount of \ngrains from the re-solidified liquid are also obvious within thick bands particularly after \n8 minutes holding.  Apart from these grains, the grain size at 8 minutes holding could be \nas low as 120\u00b5m (compare with the size at 2 minutes holding of 318 \u00b1 32 \u00b5m); the \nbands now appear to have disintegrated.  \n \nIn general, the thin liquid films formed at grain boundaries thickened as time and \ntemperature increased.  However, at 1450 and 1460\u00b0C, a substantial amount of these \ngrain boundaries still exhibit very thin liquid films that might be insufficient for grains \nto flow past each other.  At 1470\u00b0C, particularly after 8 minutes holding, thick liquid \nfilms are achieved at grain boundaries (plus the formation of grains from re-solidified \nliquid).  These microstructures could be suitable for the thixoforming process (despite \ntheir lack of conventional appearance) as the initial shear may cause the liquid pools to \nlink up [27].  Detailed discussion on the microstructural development of the material  \nduring partial remelting from two different starting conditions can be found in [28]. \n \n3.3 Thixoforming \n \nFrom the results of  the partial remelting experiment, a suitable temperature for \nthixoforming the HP9\/4\/30 appears to be at 1470\u00b0C (Fig. 10 (b,c)).  Hence, heating \ntrials were carried out to determine suitable heating conditions (power sequence and \ntime) of the thixoformer induction furnace to reach that temperature.  The slug was \nheated by means of an induction system and, for reasons of productivity and material \ncharacteristics, was heated as quickly and as uniformly as possible [3,25].  Various \npower settings were experimented with and it was found that a high power of 24kW (at \n1000Hz current frequency) gave initial relatively rapid heating of the slug while \nmaintaining its position inside the induction coil.  The thixoforming press set-up at \nSheffield only allows a slug to be rested on a pedestal without a holding mechanism, \nhence an excessive power input at the initial stage of heating could cause the steel slug \nto jump or be displaced due to the sudden strong electromagnetic field produced by the \ninduction system.   \n \nThe thixoforming heating cycle shown in Fig. 4 indicates that the power capacity \nwas initially at 24kW with a rapid rise of temperature (~5\u00b0C\/s) until a plateau was \nreached at about 780\u00b0C.  Here the material has reached its Curie point, above which it \nceases to be magnetic.  The power then was raised sharply to 96kW with a temperature \nrise of about 7\u00b0C\/s, hence quickly reaching 1400\u00b0C in about 1\u00bd minutes.  This was \nfollowed by a fusion and homogenising third stage, whereby the power was slightly \nreduced to 91.2kW resulting in a slower and relatively uniform heating at very high \ntemperatures of about 1470-1480\u00b0C.  The heating profile also showed that the surface of \nthe slug heats up first due to the \u2018skin effect\u2019 phenomenon [15,29,30].  The inside of the \nslug heats up more slowly via thermal conduction from the hotter surface.  At the end of \nthe heating period, the inside of the slug is hotter owing to the radiation losses from the \nouter surface.  The material exhibits a small semi-solid range of about 70\u00b0C (i.e. ~1430 \n\u2013 1500\u00b0C) (see Fig. 6) with a rapid increase in liquid fraction from about 30% to 80% \nfrom 1460 to 1480\u00b0C.  The radiation losses at these high temperatures had produced a \nthin solid skin surface which was easily broken during forging.  The effect could be of \nan advantage for the thixoforming process; in that it reduces the possibility of the billet \ncollapsing, particularly if as high as 50 to 80% liquid is involved (as in this particular \ncase with HP9\/4\/30) at forging. \n \nAlthough the partial remelting tests on small coupons indicated that a suitable \nstructure for thixoforming could be achieved at processing temperature of 1470\u00b0C at 8 \nminutes holding, it was found in practice that it was almost impossible to maintain a \nconstant temperature within the slug at this extremely high temperature for such a \nperiod due to the radiation losses as mentioned above.  The heating profile showed that \nthe fusion stage achieved was within the range of 1470-1480\u00b0C.  The maximum holding \ntime used during the thixoforming tests was 2 minutes.  \n \nFig. 11 shows four thixoformed fingers forged at 500mm\/s ram speed (die filling \nvelocity), 90s dwell, at temperatures of 1470\u00b0C at zero minute hold and \u2018in the range \n1470-1480\u00b0C\u2019 at 0.5, 1 and 2 minutes holding times, from a cylindrical slug of 40mm \ndiameter by 40mm height.  They showed that incomplete filling was obtained at the \nzero and 0.5 minutes hold, while at 1 and 2 minutes, complete filling was achieved with \nthe fingers showing the exact shape and surface detail of the die cavities.  Fig. 12 shows \nthe load-displacement signal profiles of the thixoformed fingers shown in Fig. 11.  The \nprofiles show only part of the stroke length of the ram just after the slug first impacts \nthe top of the die denoted by the zero position on the ram displacement axis (note that \nthe height of the slug is 40mm and that the ram movement is to the left of the profiles).  \nGenerally all the profiles exhibited a similar pattern and can be divided into four distinct \nzones.  As an example, these zones are marked on the \u2018zero minute soak\u2019 profile of Fig. \n12: the slug prior to it first touches the top die, zone (1);  it showed a peak load (2) just \nafter the slug first touches the top die;  followed by a significant drop in load thereafter \n(3) and a rapid increase of load when the material fills the die (4), or in the case of \nincomplete filling, freezes prematurely.  However, an increase in processing \ntemperature and holding time showed a decrease in the first peak load encountered. \n \nLoad versus displacement curves under an actual thixoforming process are \ndiscussed here as against load-displacement curves from rapid compression tests (on \naluminium alloys) as reported by other researchers such as Hogg et al. [31], Chayong \n[32] and Liu et al. [33].   They carried out rapid compression tests with instrumented \ndies in order to simulate the thixotropic flow behaviour of materials during the rapid \ncompression experienced by the billet during an actual thixoforming condition.  Kopp et \nal. [34] on the other hand, had studied the thixotropic behaviour of a Sn-15%Pb alloy by \nplotting load-displacement profiles from simple compression tests.  Both sets of \ncompression tests showed a similar pattern of load-displacement profiles to the ones \nshown here.  The four zones of load against displacement profiles shown in this work \ncould then be explained as: (1) near zero load zone prior to reaching the die.  The load is \nnot equal to zero prior to contact with the die because in this work the load signal was \ncollected from the ram, as against the load cell at the back of the die in Liu et al. [33], \nHogg et al. [31] and Chayong\u2019s [32] work.  Since the load signal was converted by a \npressure transducer from the hydraulic fluid pressure exerted by the ram, the movement \nof the ram in the majority of the stroke length will give non-zero load values prior to \nfirst impact of the billet with the die [35].  (2) Structure breakdown zone.  The peak load \nshould be the initial structure breakdown load, which represents the load required for \nde-cohesion of a proportion of insufficiently wetted grain boundaries and segregation \nbands.  The load required to overcome the resistance to shear of the broken down \nstructure could also contribute to the sharp peak [31].  The magnitude of the peaks \ncould be an indicator of the amount of insufficiently wetted grain boundaries and \nsegregation bands present at the processing condition.  The peak load of about 17kN at \nzero minute holding is more than three times the peak load at 2 minutes holding.  (3) \nThixotropic zone.  Once the breakdown phenomenon is completed, the solid grains are \nnow surrounded by a liquid phase and so, sufficient grain boundary decohesion is \nachieved and the semi-solid material starts to show thixotropic flow behaviour (or only \npartially for the case of the zero and 0.5 minute holding time).  A flow load as low as \n1kN was achieved when processing at 2 minutes holding.  (4) Rapid increase in the load \nas the semi-solid slurry fills the die cavity or freezes (resulting in incomplete die \nfilling).  Also note that this load for the 0.5 minute holding time rises more rapidly \ncompared with the 1 minute holding although the structure breakdown zone peaks are \nabout the same magnitude.  The thixoforming load-displacement signals obtained \nindicate that, to achieve complete die filling, it would be desirable to have a low \nstructure breakdown load in zone (2), and an almost constant or very slow rise of \nthixotropic flow load of zone (3).  The work so far shows that these load signals are \ngreatly influenced by processing temperatures and holding times. \n \n \n4 Conclusions \n \nThe work carried out has demonstrated the feasibility of thixoforming a high \nperformance, high alloy HP9\/4\/30 steel with typically microsegregated starting \nstructures.  The material is successfully thixoformed from its semi-finished ingot at \nprocessing temperatures in the range of 1470-1480\u00b0C at 1 and 2 minutes holding.  This \nis despite the lack of a \u2018conventional\u2019 thixoformable microstructure (i.e. spheroidal solid \ngrains in a liquid matrix). Here, shearing may cause liquid pools to link up resulting in a \nslurry flow load as low as 1kN.  Furthermore, despite thixoforming at very high liquid \npercent (about 50 to 80% according to DTA), heat loss (through radiation and \nconvection) has produced a thin solid skin on the surface of the slug, preventing it from \ncollapsing prior to processing. \n \nThe thixoforming load-displacement signals obtained indicate that, to achieve \ncomplete die filling, it would be desirable to have a low structure breakdown load in \nzone (2), and an almost constant or very slow rise of thixotropic flow load of zone (3).  \nThe work so far shows that these load signals are greatly influenced by processing \ntemperatures and holding times.  Further work on the optimisation of the thixoforming \nprocess and microstructural analysis in relation to the mechanical properties of the \nobtained parts is ongoing. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors wish to thank Dr Ian Todd for helpful discussions, Corus \nEngineering Steels, Rotherham, United Kingdom, for supplying the materials, and the \nNational University of Malaysia (UKM), Bangi, Malaysia, for partly providing the \nfinancial support. \n \n \n \nReferences \n \n[1]  D.B.
