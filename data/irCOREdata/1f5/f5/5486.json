Much of\nthe recent research into learning in immersive virtual worlds centres around games and\ngaming and is largely underpinned by cognitive learning theories that focus on linearity,\nproblem-solving and the importance of attaining the \u2018right answer\u2019 or game plan. Most\nresearch to date has been undertaken into students\u2019 experiences of virtual learning\nenvironments, discussion forums and perspectives about what and how online learning\nhas been implemented. This article reviews the literature relating to learning in\nimmersive virtual worlds, and suggests that there needs to be a reconsideration of what\n\u2018learning\u2019 means in such spaces.\nKeywords: immersive virtual worlds; literature review; learning\nIntroduction\nThis article seeks to explore the ways in which learning theories and current literature might\ninform the use of immersive virtual worlds1 and argues for a move towards a social reform\nperspective that is more appropriate not only for an increasingly diverse student population,\nacross the higher education sector, but also in terms of the changing nature of the university.\nFor example, students of the twenty-first century, compared with former years, are more\nmixed in age range, tend to be in employment whilst studying, learn on the move and have\ndiverse expectations of what learning should be. It will be argued throughout that: \n(1) Implementation of learning in immersive virtual worlds in higher education lacks\npedagogical underpinning;\n(2) E-learning and learning in immersive virtual worlds have, to date, largely been\ninformed by cognitive approaches to learning; and\n(3) \u2018Learning\u2019 in immersive worlds, in the context of higher education, needs to be re-\nconsidered in the context of a social reform model of education.\nThe impact of cognitive theories on immersive virtual worlds research\nMuch of the recent research into learning in immersive worlds centres around games and\ngaming and is largely underpinned by cognitive learning theories that focus on linearity,\n*Email: hsx249@coventry.ac.uk\n152  M. Savin-Baden\nproblem-solving and the importance of attaining the \u2018right answer\u2019 or game plan. For exam-\nple, Ravenscroft and Matheson (2002) discuss using dialogue games with 15\u201316-year-olds\nwhich comprise ways of computing dialogic interaction between tutor and students that can\nbe measured to ensure the students get the right answers in disciplines such as physics. A\nstudy by Johnson (2007) explored how students perceived knowledge construction in the\ncontext of an e-learning environment, and argued that the synchronous discussion resulted\nin learning that was deep and reflexive, yet there was little evidence to support this.\nHowever, other researchers have argued that they are using immersive virtual worlds to\nenable students to transfer skills from one area to another, for example: \nThe River City MUVE is centered on skills of hypothesis formation and experimental design,\nas well as on content related to national standards and assessments in biology and ecology \u2026\nStudents learn to behave as scientists while they collaboratively identify problems through\nobservation and inference, form and test hypotheses, and deduce evidence-based conclusions\nabout underlying causes. (Dede 2005)\nYet one of the underlying principles of this approach is the assumption that transfer across\ndomains is relatively straightforward. Eva, Neville and Norman (1998) have suggested that\nthe problem-solving theories concerning ways in which students transfer knowledge from\none context to another fall into two broad areas: \n\u25cf Abstract induction, which presumes that students learn principles or concepts from\nexposure to multiple problems by abstracting a general rule, thus it is independent of\ncontext.\n\u25cf Conservative induction, which assumes that the rule is not separated from the problem\ncontext but that expertise emerges from having the same principle available in multiple\nproblem contexts.\nThe subtextual assumption here is that by teaching principles of problems, students will then\nuse these principles to solve other similar problems. Inevitably, this raises questions about\nthe extent to which problem-solving can be classed as a generalisable skill and whether some\nknowledge is necessarily foundational to other knowledge or indeed transferable from one\ncontext to another. Such a difficulty can also be seen in the literature relating to affordances.\nThe concept of affordances has become increasingly used in research and technology since\nthe late 1980s. The term originated from Gibson, who developed the ecological approach to\nvisual perception in which he argued that: \nWhen no constraints are put in the visuals system, we look around, walk up to something\ninteresting and move around it so as to see it from all sides, and go from one vista to another.\nThat is natural vision \u2026 (Gibson 1979, 1)\nThus is it possible to see how this term has been (mis-)appropriated when we realise that he\nargued: \u201cThe affordances of the environment are what it offers, the animal, what it provides\nor furnishes, for good or ill\u201d (115, original italics). The use then of \u2018affordances\u2019 seems at\none level to have provoked an overemphasis on what particular technologies prompt or\nallow us to do, bringing with it a sense of covert control. Indeed Malaby (2006) suggested\nthat virtual worlds \u201cpresent for their users an increasingly varied and complex set of\naffordances\u201d (144). On the other hand there is a sense that the term is used because it offers\na linguistic position and format through which it is possible to discuss the complexity,\ninteractions and impact of technologies on higher education. Thus, as Oliver (2005, 412)\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   153\nargues, the notion of affordances has little value unless \u201cwe are willing to abandon construc-\ntivist values in order to explore \u2018inherent properties\u2019 in a positivistic sense\u201d. One option here\nthat might help to counter Oliver\u2019s concerns would be to adopt actor-network theory (ANT).\nThis approach (Latour 2005) seeks to explain the interaction between the material and the\nsemiotic, but carries with it a sense of precariousness, since the focus is on nodes that have\nas many dimensions as connections with the strength of the approach occurring through\ndissemination. Such a stance allows for technology to be seen as an iterative component of\nthe technology-pedagogy narrative, rather than something that is reductionist. However,\nwhat remains problematic with ANT is that the approach does not allow for explanation to\nbe made about why particular networks take the forms they do, which may in fact underline\nfurther Oliver\u2019s concerns about affordances.\nWithin the current literature there are also other areas and terms which compound the\ndifficulty of discussing learning in immersive virtual worlds. For example, the term \u2018virtual\nlearning environment\u2019 (VLE) is generally defined as a set of learning and teaching tools\ninvolving online technology designed to enhance students\u2019 learning experience, for\nexample, Blackboard, WebCT, but because of the words \u2018virtual\u2019 and \u2018environment\u2019 they\nhave been confused with immersive virtual worlds, which are in fact very different. There\nare also phrases such as Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 which, whilst helpful in defining differences\nin many instances, are also not unproblematic. For example, Web 1.0 was largely seen as\nthe movement of information into digital spaces, for example news, music and information,\nand is in many ways epitomised by the VLE as an information-giving platform with some\nother features such as discussion fora. Web 2.0 on the other hand is characterised by social\nlearning and networking and the use of web services to integrate diverse sources of data.\nSince the emergence of the Web 2.0 movement in 2004, there has been considerable\ndebate about what constitutes Web 2.0 and what does not. Yet it would seem that the growth\nof this movement is liquid in nature and is something that is constantly developing and\nemerging differently. O\u2019Reilly (2005) has argued that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a hard boundary, but\nrather a gravitational core\u201d. Others suggest that it does not refer to one development, but\nrather a series of emergent technologies such as Google, flickr, del.icio.us, wikis and blogs.\nFurther, authors such as Hargittai (2002, 2007) have found through surveys of young adults\nthat the use of sites such as Facebook, MySpace, Xanga, and Friendster is not randomly\ndistributed across a group of highly wired users. Although gender, race and ethnicity, and\nparental educational background are associated with use, people with more experience and\nautonomy of use are more likely to be users of such sites. However, as Alexander argues,\n\u201cUltimately, the label \u2018Web 2.0\u2019 is far less important than the concepts, projects and\npractices included in its scope\u201d (2006, 33). A further difficulty of the Web 2.0 movement\nseems to be some rather naive assumptions and impositions that appear to prevent engage-\nment with complex issues from a critical perspective. For example, there are those (such as\nBruns and Humphreys 2005) that believe that current education systems are still text-based\nand linear, arguing instead that wikis are not. Such views illustrate a naive stance toward\nwikis, which can be linear and may change relatively little over a year. Yet such perspec-\ntives illustrate that there are many in the digital community who lack in-depth understand-\nings of models of knowledge and diverse approaches to teaching, learning and assessment.\nYet what is interesting about the studies and literature that relate to learning in immer-\nsive virtual worlds is the tendency to focus on cognitive mapping and the organisation of\nlearning. One of the earliest cognitive theories, bridging the gap from behaviourism to\nconstructivism, came through Tolman\u2019s work on sign theory and cognitive mapping.\nTolman (1948) believed that learners have goals and follow signs on the way to the goal.\nThus learners should try to find the overall structure of the problem and then the gaps and\n154  M. Savin-Baden\nincongruities become the stimuli for learning. In practice this means that instruction should\nbe based on the organisation of learning (Wertheimer 1923\/1938, 1959). More recently\nAusubel, Novak, and Hanesian\u2019s assimilation theory of learning (1978) suggested that\nlearning occurs when a learner is presented with new information whose external or internal\ncharacteristics enables the learner to associate it with previous learning. Thus advanced\norganisers, or a bridge between new material and existing ideas, are instrumental for learn-\ning. Therefore in terms of learning in immersive worlds, prior experience of gaming may,\nfor some students, be advanced organisers. However, the cognitive developmental theorists\noffer models that take account of cognition and development and are perhaps more helpful\nmodels when considering learning in immersive worlds. The teacher\u2019s concern here is in\nenabling students to develop both understandings of the nature of knowledge and ways of\nhandling different conceptions of the world, so that knowledge acquisition is seen as an\nactive process. What has emerged from combining cognitive and developmental fields has\nbeen the extension of Piaget\u2019s (Piaget, 1929) work by Perry, who undertook a qualitative\nstudy of men at Harvard. He devised nine positions that described how male students\u2019\nconceptions of the nature and origins of knowledge evolved (Perry 1970, 1988). This study\nput issues of learner experience centre stage and suggested that students proceed through a\nsequence of developmental stages. Belenky et al. (1986), stimulated by Perry\u2019s work,\nexplored diverse women\u2019s perspectives and identified five categories of \u2018ways of knowing\u2019.\nFor example, women began from a position of silence where they saw themselves as mind-\nless and in later stages both constructed and created knowledge. Such models acknowledge\nthat what is missing from many curricula is recognition of the role and relevance of learning\nfrom and through experience, which can prompt the shaping and reconstructing of people\u2019s\nlives as learners and teachers. Yet before using these as informing theories for future\nresearch possibilities, it is useful to explore the research and literature that has been under-\ntaken to date.\nInforming literature\nThere has been a series of studies funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee\n(JISC) in the UK that have explored students\u2019 perspectives of e-learning. Firstly, Sharpe\net al. (2005) undertook a scoping study that provided a database of research, but found\nfew studies whose main focus was students\u2019 experiences. Secondly, the LEX study\n(Creanor et al. 2006) undertook a snapshot of learner experience and found students did\nnot see e-learning as separate from other approaches and that control and choice over\ntechnologies were important to them. Thirdly, the LXP study (Conole et al. 2006) was\nperhaps the most extensive study and used mixed methods to examine disciplinary differ-\nences in technology use by university students. This study found that students often use\npersonal technology such as mobile phones and standard software for learning, that search\nengines were preferred to libraries and that peers provided invisible support and \u201can under-\nworld of communication\u201d (11). These studies, although using relatively small data sets,\nwould seem to indicate students\u2019 experiences of e-learning are more complex and wide-\nranging than many university tutors realise. Such studies would also seem to indicate that\nlinearity, narrow problem-solving and bounded approaches to learning where knowledge is\nmanaged and patrolled by staff is likely to be inappropriate for learning at university in the\ntwenty-first century.\nThe most recent literature review that would seem to offer some purchase on students\u2019\nexperiences is that undertaken by de Freitas (2006). This review examined the various uses\nof game-based learning worldwide. It presents a comprehensive overview of a diverse\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   155\nnumber of games, simulations and immersive worlds. Yet although this review is entitled\n\u2018Learning in Immersive Worlds\u2019, there is relatively little about learning per se, illustrating\nthat documenting educational practice is not the same as engaging with the nature of learn-\ning. What de Freitas does in fact offer is an overview of what is occurring in gaming worlds\nwhich are exploited for education, but there is minimal exploration of the pedagogical\nimpact and no location of this literature in relation to the student experience. It is an\ninteresting review but it offers little in the way of either the pedagogical positioning of\ngames or recommendations for locating them pedagogically in the curriculum.\nThe most extensive research to date undertaken into students\u2019 experiences of VLEs\nincludes explorations of discussion forums and perspectives about what and how online\nlearning has been implemented. This literature indicates largely that technology has led the\npedagogy, but Sharpe et al. (2006) have pointed out that successful institutions\u2019 rationales\nfor implementing e-learning have included flexibility of provision, supporting diversity,\nenhancing the campus experience, operating in a global context and efficiency. Yet none of\nthese recommendations are pedagogically located. Furthermore, there is little, if any,\nexploration of the kinds of e-learning spaces that are commonly adopted or the rationale\nfor their use. For example, VLEs such as Blackboard may be used in ways that contain and\ncontrol learning, whereas there is a current tendency to use IVWs for the kinds of learning\nthat focus on the deconstruction of knowledges and identity work. Although this is a\ngeneralisation, it does seem to be a trend. However, the point is that how, when and why\nparticular e-spaces are used does bear further exploration. This is because the type of e-\nspace and the way in which it is used (or not used) to manage knowledge will affect the\nkinds of learning opportunities offered to students. However, there are a number of studies\nthat have specifically focused on the students\u2019 experience. Jones and Cooke (2006) used\ntwo case studies to explore students\u2019 online discussions to enhance understanding of how\nstudents learn. Students were positive overall about their online experience, even if they\ndid encounter problems, such as fellow students not participating in discussion forums.\nBayne (2005) studied how students and teachers experienced their identities online, and\nhow these related to their embodied \u2018real life\u2019 identities. A common perspective amongst\nstudents emerged in which online modes of identity formation were viewed negatively,\nprimarily as the true self being deceitfully threatened by the online being. Bayne\u2019s research\nconcluded that tutors\u2019 use of the online space to (re)construct themselves as authority\nfigures was far less problematic and far less a cause of anxiety than the identity narratives\nprovided by students.\nThe rationale for using learning in IVWs in higher education, it is suggested here, is\nbecause practicing skills within a virtual environment online offers advantages over learn-\ning through real-life practice, in particular the exposure of learners to a wide range of\nscenarios (more than they are likely to meet in a standard face-to-face programme) at a\ntime and pace convenient to the learner, together with consistent feedback. It offers learners\nthe chance to make mistakes without real-world repercussions. Further, with the increasing\nuse of distance programmes, IVWs create online learning opportunities which are suffi-\nciently immersive and collaborative outside the tutorial room, in ways that current VLE\nsystems do not. Learning in IVWs seems to offer new opportunities to the study of the\nsocio-political impact of learning in higher education. This is because spaces such as\nSecond Life are universal, are not bounded by time or geography and in particular adopt\ndifferent learning values than other learning spaces (Savin-Baden 2007; Olsen et al. 2004;\nMalaby 2006). It would seem then that there remains little research into or understanding of\nstudent learning in IVWs and perhaps adopting a social reform perspective could inform\nsuch learning in advance of implementations which would otherwise take a narrowly\n156  M. Savin-Baden\nfocused cognitive stance. It may be that it is possible to locate approaches to e-learning as\nshown in Table 1, in order to illustrate the possible challenges of utilising immersive virtual\nworlds for learning.\nSocial reform for learning in immersive worlds: structuration in action?\nAlthough cognitive theories can be seen as being located along a trajectory between those\nwho stratify and order thinking and knowledge, and those who see cognition as a develop-\nmental process, a shift is required towards a social reform model in the context of learning\nin immersive worlds. This is because, to date, much of the learning in higher education\ntends to ignore this approach, despite it seeming to be a sound fit with both Web 2.0 learning\nand particularly learning in immersive virtual worlds. This approach focuses on teaching as\na collective process which challenges the status quo (and would seem to reach beyond\nearlier approaches suggested by Freire 1974 and Mezirow 1981). Thus learning is seen as a\nprocess of encouraging students to consider how they are positioned through the discourses\nand practices with which they are expected to engage. In practice, a shift to this approach\nin learning in immersive virtual worlds would mean: \nClass discussion is focused less on how knowledge has been created, and more by whom and\nfor what purposes. Texts are interrogated for what is said and what is not said; what is included\nand what is excluded; who is represented and who is omitted from the dominant discourse.\nStudents are encouraged to take critical stances to give them power to take social action to\nimprove their own lives and the lives of others. (Pratt and Collins 2006)\nThis approach then is not only about learning with technology but deconstructing how given\nnotions of technology and pedagogy position students. A shift towards a social reform\nperspective will require that learning in immersive virtual worlds will need to focus exten-\nsively on the relationship between structure and agency. Human agency addresses the way\nin which people\u2019s aspirations, expectations and perceptions influence the way that they\nexecute their roles. By responding to human agency at an individual level, universities will\nbe imbued with a degree of flexibility that will enable adaptation to the needs of the varied\nand diverse student communities involved. This will then lead to the understanding that\nindividual empowerment is a vector for knowledge transfer; the system itself is only a\nmechanism which provides merely a facilitating framework. What is particularly important\nhere is the structure-agency debate that introduces questions about the nature of social\nbehaviour: whether it is ultimately predictable in terms of the creative volition of the\nindividual, or is largely a product of socialisation, interaction and greater social structures.\nGiddens\u2019 theory of structuration (Giddens 1984) is an attempt to reconcile theoretical\ndichotomies such as structure and agency. Giddens suggests human agency and social\nstructure are in a relationship with each other, and it is the repetition of the acts of individual\nagents which reproduces the structure. Structures can be modified by human agents who are\nalso constrained by those structures, which illustrates the complex interplay of the mutually\nconstitutive duality of structure and agency. However, in light of shifts in time and spaces\nand the intersections of identities, it might be that social structure such as traditions,\ninstitutions, moral codes and established ways of doing things can be changed when\nstudents begin to ignore them, replace them or reproduce them differently. Thus perhaps\nwhat needs to be explored further in terms of student experiences of learning in immersive\nvirtual worlds is a regeneration of the three types of structures (Giddens 1984) in social\nsystems, which are perhaps more reflective of Giddens\u2019 more recent work on identity and\nsociety, which I have reconstituted as follows: \nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology

Savin-Baden\n\u25cf Signification: produces meaning through organised webs of language and even the\nlanguage of webs\n\u25cf Legitimation: produces a moral order via naturalisation in societal norms, values and\nstandards, but which is challenged through knowledges created in and through\nimmersive worlds\n\u25cf Domination: produces (and is an exercise of) power, originating from the control of\nresources, which can be transgressed though produsage.2\nWhat is perhaps needed are \u2018smooth curricula spaces\u2019 (Savin-Baden 2007, following\nDeleuze and Guattari 1988 and Bayne 2004) which are open, flexible and contested; spaces\nin which both learning and learners are always on the move. Movement in such curricula is\nnot towards a given trajectory. Instead, there is a sense of displacement of notions of time\nand place, so that curricula are delineated with and through the staff and students; they are\ndefined by the creators of the space(s). These kinds of curricula are likely to be seen as risky\nsince they prompt consideration of what counts as legitimate knowledge. In these kinds of\ncurricula students will be encouraged to examine the underlying structures and belief\nsystems implicit within what is being learned, in order to not only understand the disciplin-\nary area but also its credence. What will be important in the creation of these kinds of curric-\nula is the position of disregarded knowledge3 as a central space, in which uncertainty and\ngaps are recognised along with the realisation of the relative importance of gaps between\ndifferent knowledges and different knowledge hierarchies. The increasing need to manage\nthe interplay of identities in face-to-face lives is further complicated by managing the\nembodied identities of the virtual world. For example, working and learning in immersive\nvirtual worlds introduces juxtaposition and cross-over between real life and Second Life,\nwhere multiple pasts travel with us. This would seem to suggest that a trajectory into\/in\/with\nWeb 2.0 technologies requires a university that engages more thoroughly with these \u2018third\nspaces\u2019.4 Such a university would enable an exploration of the ways in which past, current\nand future identities are present, embodied and multiply interacting with each other in these\nspaces. Further, there are issues about learning, play and fun and how we also play in and\nthrough our identities in virtual spaces. Rieber, Smith, and Noah (1998) have suggested that\nthe notion of \u2018serious play\u2019, which is characterised as an intense learning experience,\ninvolves considerable energy and commitment and that serious play is important for the\ndevelopment of high order thinking, commitment and engagement. Immersive world\nidentities are ones that would seem to be at play in this way; it is a demanding and engaging\nenvironment, whether travelling, exploring, or participating in seminars. Universities of the\nfuture will need to develop spaces in worlds such as this, but also utilise games and play\neffectively \u2013 whether through game playing or games design. An example of this is seen in\nthe Quest Atlantis project (Barab, Arici, and Jackson 2005), a 3D game for children that\nwould essentially seem to have a problem-based learning pedagogy as its central focus.\nApproaches such as this, which mirror problem-based learning for critical contestability\n(Savin-Baden 2000), need to be adopted in higher education in order to create spaces for\ncurricula and societal spaces of social reform. If we are to create such immersive learning\nspaces where learning is liquid and knowledge is on the move, then curricula cannot be\nformulated in advance, as McWilliam has argued: \u201cFrom fixed and immutable, curriculum\nneed [sic] to be conceptualised as content for meddling with\u201d (2005, 7, original emphasis).\nYet curricula need to be seen not just as content for meddling with, but as diverse spaces of\nopportunity. It is in such spaces that we can explore the possibilities for creating curricula\nfor living with chronic uncertainty, liminality and spaces of unknowability. Curricula then\nwill become a series of open-ended spaces rather than a series of permissions to proceed that\nALT-J, Research in Learning Technology   159\nfocus on compliance and rule-based models. Such open-ended curricula will be provisional,\nunstable and uncertain, and will reflect the translocational state of the university of the\nfuture.\nIn conclusion\nFor students who spend over six hours a day on social networking and just over three hours\na day on email, surfing the net and instant messaging (Harris Interactive 2006), it is clear\nuniversities need to rethink learning in immersive worlds. Indeed, universities need to begin\nto consider ways in which they might unbracket online and offline learning, as Evans has\nsuggested (2004). Immersive virtual worlds offer different textualities that are increasingly\nushering in new issues and concerns, such as consensus over authority and process over\nproduct. Indeed, what also seems to be emerging from immersive virtual worlds is not just\ndifferent textualities, but the spatialisation of knowledge, whereby knowledge is multiply\nlocated and linked, reconstituted and contested across time and space. In immersive virtual\nworlds temporality and spatiality become not just contested but dynamic and intersected by\none another. Maybe what is needed is the creation not of universities but ruins, to create\nborderless spaces, much as the University of Bologna once was. Perhaps this is what social\nreform approaches offer over cognitive approaches to learning capabilities: the opportunity\nto strip universities of their architectured and disciplinary walls and to interrupt established\npractices and the power inherent in those practices. \nAcknowledgement\nWith thanks to Dr Hamish McLeod, University of Edinburgh for his feedback on this article in its\ninitial configuration\nNotes\n1. Immersive virtual worlds are defined here as 3D virtual worlds that can be\/are adapted for educa-\ntional purposes.\n2. Bruns (2007) has suggested that we are now in the realms of \u2018produsage\u2019, characterised by\ncommunity-based production, fluid roles, unfinished artefacts and common property.\n3. Disregarded knowledge (Savin-Baden 2007) encompasses knowledge often equated with\nemotional intelligence, such as when and how to use self-promotion, when to keep silent and\nwhen to intervene, but also with Haraway\u2019s (1991) concept of responsible knowledge \u2013 the need\nto take responsibility for the position from which we speak.\n4. The notion of the \u2018third space\u2019 captures the idea that there are \u201cparticular discursive spaces \u2026 in\nwhich alternative and competing discourses and positioning transform conflict and difference\ninto rich zones of collaboration and learning\u201d (Guti\u00e9rrez, Baquedano-Lopez, and Tejeda 1999,\n286\u20137).\nReferences\nAlexander, B. 2006.
