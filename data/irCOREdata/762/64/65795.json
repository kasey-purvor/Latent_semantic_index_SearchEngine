Under mass-action kinetics, the conditions under \nwhich the reaction maintains a stable steady state are analytically derived and numerically \nconfirmed. It is shown that, in order to maintain a steady state in the regulated reaction, maximal \nenzyme activity must be much higher than input rate. Moreover, it is revealed that requirements \nfor large enzyme activity are due to substrate inhibition. It is suggested that high activities of \nenzymes may play a vital role in protecting a stable state from its catastrophic collapse, giving an \nadditional explanation to an intriguing problem - why the activities of some enzymes greatly \nexceed the flux capacity of a pathway.  In addition, dissipation of the enzymatic reaction is \nanalysed. It is shown that collapse of stable states is always associated with a point at which \ndissipation is the highest. Therefore, in order to maintain a stable state, dissipation of the reaction \nmust be less than a critical value. Moreover, although external forcing may not change net mass \nflow, it may lead to collapse of stable states. Furthermore, when stable states collapse at a critical \nforcing amplitude and period, dissipation also reaches a highest value. It is concluded that \ncollapse of stable steady state in the enzyme system with substrate inhibition always corresponds \nto critical points at which dissipation is highest, regardless if the reaction is forced or not. \nTherefore, for the substrate inhibited reaction, maintenance of stable states is intrinsically related \nto level of dissipation. \n 3\n \n \nIntroduction \nIn a living system, a metabolic network comprises many complicatedly connected reactions, \nexchanges material and energy with its surrounding, and dissipates energy. Therefore, an \nmetabolic network is an integrative and open system, its study needs to define a boundary at \nwhich materials are transported into or out of the network [1].  By analysing a network and its \nboundary fluxes as a whole, constraint-based approach has emerged as a useful tool for analysis \nof the integrated functions of the network [2-10].  Broadly speaking, constraint-based approach \nanalyses the possible flux distributions under the constraints of stoichiometry, thermodynamics \nand kinetics, and links them with possible phenotypic outcomes.  Those constraints restrict \ndifferent aspects of the network. Specifically,  stoichiometric constraints restrict the molar \nrelation of reactants; thermodynamic constraints confine the direction of reactions [1, 11-15]; and \nkinetic constraints guarantee the formation of stable states that are necessary for implementing \nbiological functions [16,17]. In a network, each enzymatic reaction is an essential component for \nconstructing the network, and it also has a boundary at which substrate is supplied and product is \nremoved. In general, an enzyme-catalysed reaction is embedded in a pathway, taking product \nmolecules of the preceding reaction step and supplying substrate for the subsequent step [18]. \nEnzyme molecules bind with substrate molecules to form an intermediate complex. \nSubsequently, the intermediate complex releases product molecules and the enzyme becomes \navailable for catalysis again. Finally, the freed enzyme molecules bind substrate molecules again, \nand the process repeats. Enzyme catalysis can be inhibited or activated by compounds which are \nthemselves reaction products, and the consequent network of feedback and feedforward reactions \nare the basis of biological functioning in cells. \n 4\n \nIf an enzyme-catalysed reaction cannot establish a stable state when it is with substrate input and \nproduct removal, the network comprising the same reaction cannot reach a stable state. In this \nsense, a single enzyme-catalysed reaction is an important prototype for understanding the \nformation of stable states in a network. This work examines three aspects about maintenance of \nstable states in an enzyme reaction system with substrate inhibition.  \n \nFirstly, based on mass-action kinetics, the conditions under which the reaction maintains steady \nstates are analytically derived and numerically confirmed. It is shown that, in order to maintain a \nsteady state in the regulated reaction, maximal enzyme activity must be much higher than input \nrate. Moreover, it is revealed that requirements for high enzyme activity are due to substrate \ninhibition. It is suggested that, when enzymes are regulated,  high activities of enzymes may play \na vital role in protecting a stable state from its catastrophic collapse, giving an additional \nexplanation to an intriguing problem - why the activities of some enzymes greatly exceed the flux \ncapacity of a pathway  [19,20].  \n \nSecondly, in terms of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, any reaction with non-zero flux \ndissipates energy. An enzymatic reaction comprises a number of elementary reactions. The total \ndissipation of those elementary reactions represents the thermodynamic dissipation of the enzyme \nreaction. Furthermore, dissipation is closely associated with the concept of thermodynamic \nconstraints [1, 11-15]. Is the maintenance of a stable state related to other properties of the \nsystem? For example, is the collapse of a stable state related to dissipation?  We will examine the \nrelation between dissipation and maintenance of stable states.  \n \n 5\nThirdly, when an enzyme system settles onto a stable state, how does external forcing affect the \nstate? What is the relation between dissipation and the changes induced by external forcing?  We \nexamine the effects of forcing period and amplitude on the maintenance of stable states, and \nfurther investigate the relation between dissipation and maintenance of stable states.  \n \nDissipation and maintenance of steady states: a reversible enzymatic reaction with \nsubstrate inhibition as an example \nThe simplest enzyme kinetic model involving substrate inhibition is the Michaelis-Menten \nformalism modified by adding a binding process between substrate-enzyme complex and free \nsubstrate [21,22]. When we consider that this reaction is embedded in a pathway, substrate is \nsupplied by a preceding reaction, and product is removed by a subsequent reaction. Therefore, the \nreaction system is described as  \nS\nVin\nE + S\nk1\nk-1\nES\nES\nk2\nk-2\nE + P\nES + S\nk3\nk-3\nES2\nkPP\n \n \n \nThe governing mass-balance equation of this reaction system is \n 6\n][]][[][][\n][]][[][\n]][[][][]][[][\n][]][[][]][[][\n22\n233\n2\n2211\n23311\nPkPEkESk\ndt\nPd\nESkSESk\ndt\nESd\nPEkESkESkSEk\ndt\nEd\nESkSESkESkSEkV\ndt\nSd\nP\nin\n\u2212\u2212=\n\u2212=\n\u2212++\u2212=\n+\u2212+\u2212=\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2212\n (1) \nHere total enzyme concentration, E0 ,  is conserved, i.e.  ]][][][ 20 ESESEE ++= .

(5) \nAnalysis of equations 2-4 reveals that a steady state for which all concentrations are non-negative \nand finite only exists in a certain range of values of parameters, implying that kinetic constraints \n[16,17] restrict the formation of a steady state. Specifically, if ][S  at a steady state is non-\nnegative and finite, concentrations of all other species are non-negative and finite. Therefore, we \nexamine the conditions for maintaining non-negative and finite ][S . \n \nIn terms of equations 3 and 4, since a  and c are always non-negative, there are two possibilities. \nIf b  is positive, there is no positive solution for ][S , since acbb 42 \u2212\u00b1\u2212  <0.

Therefore,   equation 11 is the condition under which the system establishes a non-negative \n 9\nand finite steady state. Once a steady state exists, it has been shown that the state does not lose its \nlocal stability [22].  \n \nEquation 11 can be employed to comprehensively analyse the effects of kinetic parameters on the \nformation of steady state. It can be seen that increasing inV  requires the increase in maxV . \nSimilarly, increasing any of 1K , 2K , 4K , and mK  also requires the increase in maxV . However, \nincreasing 3K  corresponds to the decrease in maxV . \n \nNumerical analysis confirms that equation 11 is the condition for maintaining a steady state in the \nsystem when values of the kinetic parameters change. For example,  if all rates constants are \nunity (i.e. 14321 ==== KKKK , .2=mK ),   equation 11 becomes equation 12. \n{ })1(22)31( 2max ++++> inininin VVVVV     (12) \nFigure 1 shows an example of how equation 12 affects the evolution of the reaction system. In \nterms of equation 12, when 0.2=inV , 97.28max >V .  When 97.280.29max >=V , the system \ndevelops to a steady state for substrate S and product P (figure1a ). Simultaneously, E , ES  \nand 2ES  reaches a steady state as well (data not shown). However, when 97.2890.28max <=V , \nthe system cannot establish a steady state. Substrate S increases infinitely and product P infinitely \napproaches zero (figure 1b). Moreover, E  and ES  approaches zero, and 2ES  approaches 0E  \n(data not shown). Consequently, the catalysing cycle in the system breaks down and the system \ncannot implement biological functions. In a similar manner, based on equation 11, effects of all \nkinetic parameters on formation of steady states can be numerically analysed. For example, if \n3K =0.5 ( 1421 === KKK , ),2=mK  equation 11 gives 533.52max >V  for 0.2=inV , numerical \n 10\ncalculation confirms that if 533.5254.52max >=V , the system develops to a steady state. If  \n533.5252.52max <=V , no steady states exist. \n \n---figure 1 here---- \n \nEquations 11 and 12 show that maintenance of a steady state requires a highly nonlinear \nrelationship between the input flux and the maximal enzyme activity. If the reaction is not \ninhibited by the substrate S, as long as inVV >max , the system establishes a steady state. \nTherefore, the nonlinearity of equations 11 and 12 is the consequence of substrate inhibition.  \n \nThe above analysis clearly demonstrates that the maintenance of a steady state in the reaction \nsystem is subject to the constraints of equation 11. If equation 11 is invalid, the catalysing cycle \nof the reaction breaks down, the reaction cannot perform biological functions. However, is the \nmaintenance of a steady state related to other properties of the system? For example, is the \ncollapse of a steady state related to dissipation?  Because energy efficiency is usually considered \nto be a vital aspect of biological functions [23-26], we further investigate if maintenance of a \nsteady state is related to dissipation of the system. \n \nWhen a steady state is established in the reaction system, the general form of dissipation of the \nreaction system can be deduced from the reaction scheme, which is described by equation 13. \n)\n][\n][lnln(\n21\n21\nS\nP\nkk\nkkRTVhd in +\u2212\u2212=\n\u2212\u2212\n   (13) \n 11\nwhere hd is dissipation, ][S  and ][P   are the steady-state concentration of substrate and product, \nrespectively.  R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. In an isothermal system, \nRT is a constant. In the following, we use equation 14 to describe dissipation. \n \n)\n][\n][lnln(\n21\n21\nS\nP\nkk\nkkV\nRT\nhdD in +\u2212\u2212==\n\u2212\u2212\n   (14) \nwhere D  is dissipation in the unit of RT . \nBased on equations 3, 4 and 14, dissipation at a steady-state can be calculated. Although effects \nof rate constants can be fully examined based on equation 14, for the simplicity we set all rate \nconstants to be unity and examine the dependence of dissipation on maximal enzyme activity and \ninput rate. Figure 2 summarises the results.   \n \n---figure 2 here--- \n \nFor a fixed inV , dissipation increases monotonically with the decrease of maxV  (figure 2a). When \nmaxV  decreases to such a value that equation 12 becomes invalid, the dissipation reaches a highest \nvalue, beyond which no stable states exist. For a fixed maxV , dissipation increases monotonically \nwith the increase of inV . When inV  increases to such a value that equation 12 becomes invalid, \nthe dissipation reaches a highest value, beyond which no stable states exist. Effects of rate \nconstants on dissipation have also been examined. It is revealed that, although rate constants may \nchange dissipation quantitatively, they do not change the trend of figure 2. Therefore, although \ncollapse of stable states may stem from either the decrease of maxV  or increase of inV ,  it always \ncorresponds to a point at which dissipation is the highest.  In other words,  in order to maintain \n 12\nstable states, the dissipation of the reaction system must not exceed a critical level. Therefore, for \nthe substrate inhibited reaction with Michaelis-Menten formalism, maintenance of stable states \nintrinsically links with level of dissipation. \n \nDissipation and maintenance of stable states under forcing  \nIn general, all enzymatic reactions in a living system are subject to a fluctuating input. These \nfluctuations may stem from varying environmental conditions, or from the interaction between \nreactions. For example, plant photosynthesis is subject to light intensity fluctuations and the \nprocesses of acquiring carbon resources are time-dependent. Moreover, since a particular reaction \nis always embedded in a pathway, its input is the output of preceding reactions. By taking into \naccount the complex manner in the network of enzymatic reactions in vivo [18], any reaction may \nbe considered to be forced by other reactions. \n \nIn general, the fluctuations can take different forms. Here, we assume that the external forcing is \nrepresented by the following equation:  \n))2sin(1(0 T\ntVVinput\n\u03c0\n\u03b5+=    (15) \nwhere \u03b5 and T are the forcing amplitude and period, respectively. In order to guarantee 0\u2265inputV  ,  \n\u03b5 is limited to the range of 0 to 1. We note that the average of inputV over an exact period is equal \nto 0V   , implying that the forcing does not change the net input rate of the system. We choose the \nvalues of parameters such that the system establishes a steady state when it is not subject to \nforcing, and study how forcing affects the maintenance of the state and dissipation. \n \n 13\nWhen the system settles onto a steady state without forcing, forcing may drive the system to lose \nits stable states. Subsequently, the system does not maintain any stable state and it therefore \ncannot implement biological functions. Figure 3 shows that two neighbouring forcing amplitudes \nmay lead to completely different evolution of the reaction system. In figure 3a, a stable limit \ncycle sustains, in addition to concentration of substrate and product, all enzyme forms, E , ES  \nand 2ES  periodically change. The reaction system settles onto a stable oscillatory state. \nHowever, in figure 3b, the catalysing cycle is destroyed. Consequently, E  and ES  approaches \nzero, and 2ES  approaches the total enzyme concentration, 0E . Substrate and product cannot settle \nonto any stable states. \n \n---Figure 3 and 4 here--- \n \nFigure 4 summarises the effects of forcing amplitude and period on the maintenance of stable \nstates. When forcing amplitude and period are such that their values are in the range below each \ncurve, the reaction system reaches a stable state. However, when their values are above each \ncurve up to forcing amplitude to be 1, no stable states exist.   Specifically, for a fixed input rate \n( 0.10 =V ), as maximal enzyme activity, maxV , increases, the system is more possible to establish \nstable states (figure 4a). Moreover, for a fixed maxV  ( 7.26max =V ), as the input rate decreases, the \nsystem is more possible to establish stable states (figure 4b). In general, the reaction system can \nprocess external signals across a broad range in period provided they have small amplitudes, but \nlarge amplitude signals may lead to the collapse of stable states. Similarly, the system can \nwithstand large amplitude signals provided the period is short, however large amplitude signals \nwith long period will lead to the collapse of stable states. We emphasize that the forcing \n 14\nsuperimposed does not change the (average) input rate. Therefore, under forcing, the (average) \nmass transported into the reaction system remains the same. However, as demonstrated by figure \n3 and 4, forcing is able to destroy stable states.  Is the collapse of stable states induced by forcing \nrelated to dissipation of the system? Therefore, we further investigate effects of forcing on \ndissipation. \n \nIn order to examine how forcing affects dissipation,  relative dissipation, R, is defined as \n0D\nDR =      (16) \nwhere 0D   is dissipation at a steady state when the system is not subject to forcing, and it does \nnot change with time,  D  is dissipation under forcing, and it changes periodically with time \n(figure 5). D  is the average of D  over an exact period.  Therefore, D  is the dissipation for the \noscillatory state.  \n \n--- figure 5 and 6 here--- \n \nFigure 6 shows how forcing affects relative dissipation in the system.  In figure 6, 0.10 =V , \n1000=T , relative dissipation is calculated for five different values of maxV . In (a), 89.8max =V , \nwhich is the minimal value calculated from equation (12). In this case, if ,0.0=\u03b5  a steady state is \nestablished. However, if \u03b5  is any positive value, no stable states exist. In curves (b) to (e), \nrelative dissipation, R  is always larger than 1, implying that the system under forcing always \ndissipates more energy. Importantly, when the system cannot maintain its stable states,  the \nrelative dissipation reaches a  point, at which dissipation is the highest,. Therefore, under forcing, \n 15\nthe system may only accommodate a certain range of dissipation. If dissipation is higher than a \ncritical value, the system cannot maintain any stable states. Further numerical analysis confirms \nthat, when forcing period changes, the collapse of stable states also corresponds a critical point, at \nwhich dissipation is the highest (data not shown). Therefore, the collapse of stable states under \nforcing follows the following scenario:  when the system is forced, forcing changes the system \nfrom a steady state to an oscillatory state and the dissipation of the system increases.  When \nforcing amplitude and period are such values that stable states cannot be maintained, dissipation \nreaches a highest value. Subsequently,  the system cannot implement any functions.  \n \nConcluding remarks \nBy analysing a reversible enzyme reaction system, this work shows that the maintenance of a \nstable state requires a highly nonlinear relation between input rate and maximal enzyme activity. \nThis nonlinearity is due to the consequences of substrate inhibition. Moreover, when the reaction \nsystem establishes a stable state with a constant input, external forcing may destroy the stable \nstate. Consequently, the system cannot implement any biological functions. Importantly, under \ncertain forcing amplitude and period, maximal enzyme activity is a key factor determining if the \nsystem establishes a stable state. Therefore, a reaction system with a certain configuration of \nenzyme activities may only stably evolve under certain external conditions. Furthermore, this \nwork also shows that, for the specific reaction,  collapse of stable steady state is intrinsically \nrelated to its dissipation, regardless if the reaction is forced or not.  \n \nEvolution of biochemical reactions is subject to constraints. Kinetic constraints [16,17] are \nconditions under which the reaction establishes stable states.  Thermodynamic constraints restrict \nthe direction of the reactions [1, 11-15]. Although thermodynamic and kinetic constraints restrict \n 16\ndifferent aspects of the reaction, they can be closely related. Analysis of the reaction system with \nsubstrate inhibition shows that dissipates too much energy may not maintain its stable states. This \ncorresponding relationship may originate from the foundation of kinetic and thermodynamic \nconstraints. Both kinetic and thermodynamic constraints are based fundamentally on elementary \nreaction steps and mass-action kinetics.  \n \nIf the reaction system is not inhibited by the substrate, as long as inVV >max , the system \nestablishes a steady state. In order to maintain a stable state in the reaction with substrate \ninhibition, maximal enzyme activity,  maxV , must be much higher than input rate. For example, in \nterms of equation 12, if  0.5=inputV ,  then 7.135max >V ; and if 0.10=inputV , then 0.608max >V . \nApproximately, maximal enzyme activity is required to be 27- and 61- fold higher than input rate \nfor the two cases, respectively. In other words, in the regulated system, maximal enzyme activity \nmust be drastically increased to maintain a stable state. In a pathway, the activities of some \nenzymes greatly exceed the flux capacity of the pathway. This intriguing problem attracts much \nattention [19, 20, and references therein]. For example, it has been argued that these high \nactivities are necessary to ensure sufficient net flux in reactions that operate near equilibrium \n[19]. Recently, by analysing a kinetic model, it is suggested that large activities may reflect a \nclose match of system design to performance requirements [20]. This work shows that, when an \nenzyme is regulated, high enzyme activities may be essential for forming a stable state. \nFurthermore, when external fluctuation exists, high activities play a vital role in protecting a \nstable state from its catastrophic collapse. Therefore, in addition to the roles previously \nsuggested, it is also possible that high activities of enzymes may be necessary for maintaining a \nstable evolution in some regulated enzymatic reactions.  \n 17\n \nEnergy conservation and dissipation in biochemical networks are important aspects for \nunderstanding biological functions [1, 11-15, 26]. In particular, in nonlinear autonomous and \nforced reaction systems, thermodynamic efficiency and dissipation have been systematically \nstudied [23-25]. It has been shown that external forcing may have advantages improving \nthermodynamic efficiency in oscillatory reactions[27]. This work shows that , under external \nforcing, if the reaction system dissipates too much energy, the system cannot maintain stable \nstates. Subsequently, no biological functions can be implemented. Therefore, reduction of \ndissipation by controlling the values of kinetic parameters such as maximal enzyme activity is \nimportant for maintaining a biologically functioning state. \n \nAlthough the rate laws for all reactions follow mass-action kinetics, for an enzymatic reaction the \nconcentration of any form of an enzyme cannot arbitrarily change as it is limited by the total \nconcentration of the enzyme. Therefore, although the saturation and regulation features of \nenzymatic rate laws cannot be immediately described by mass-action kinetics [28], they are the \nconsequences of the mass-action kinetics in which the concentrations of all forms of an enzyme \nare limited. Enzymatic kinetics are usually derived from traditional mass-action kinetics together \nwith simplifying assumptions such as the existence of a quasi-steady state [29,30]. At the level of \nenzymatic reactions, the kinetic rate laws exhibit some special features such as saturation and \nregulation [28]. Those features are due predominantly to the catalysing functions of enzymes, and \nthey are captured by Michaelis-Menten type kinetics. When a number of enzymatic reactions \ninterplay, based on enzymatic kinetics it has been shown that establishment of a stable state \nrequires specific constraints on kinetic parameters, particularly maximal reaction activities \n[16,17, 31, 32]. In order to obtain a stable steady state based on the parameters in literature, many \n 18\nof the parameters need to be adjusted [33, 34]. The constraints for formation of stable states in \nmany interplaying enzymes are kinetic constraints for a biological network [17]. Based on mass \u2013\naction kinetics, this work shows that kinetic constraints in a single enzyme system are the \nconstraints for maintaining the catalysing cycle of the enzyme. Therefore, kinetic constraints \nexist at the level of both mass-action and enzymatic kinetics.  \n \nAcknowledgement:  The author would like to acknowledge the Scottish Executive Environment \nand Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) for support.  \n 19\n \n \nReferences \n[1] H.
