Effective values for the partition 23 \ncoefficient between organic carbon and water (KOC) were derived by least-squares 24 \noptimisation of a dynamic model which accounted for partitioning between the sorbed 25 \nand dissolved phases of D5, and for losses via volatilisation and hydrolysis.  Partial 26 \nmass transfer coefficients for volatilisation were derived from model fits to controls 27 \ncontaining deionised water. Effective values of log (KOC) were between 5.8 and 6.33 28 \n(mean 6.16).  These figures are higher than some other experimentally-derived values 29 \nbut much lower than those estimated from the octanol : water partition coefficient 30 \nusing single-parameter linear free energy relationships (LFERs).  A poly-parameter 31 \nLFER gave a predicted log (KOC) of 5.5.  Differences in partitioning are believed to be 32 \ndue to the nature of the organic matter present.  The new value for effective KOC was 33 \nemployed in a simple model of D5 behaviour in rivers to ascertain the extent to which 34 \na higher affinity for organic carbon would depress volatility.

Recently, concerns 45 \nhave been raised about their environmental profile (Brooke et al., 2008) because they 46 \nhave relatively high bioconcentration factors, implying some potential for 47 \nbioaccumulation and because they partition to the atmosphere where they can 48 \npotentially be transported over long distances (e.g. Whelan et al., 2004; Wania, 2006).  49 \nOne of the most widely used cVMS materials is decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) 50 \nwhich has a range of commercial applications including acting as a carrier ingredient 51 \nin some personal care products (e.g. Horii and Kannan, 2008).  Key properties for D5 52 \nare summarised in Table 1.  Most D5 which is used in cosmetic products is likely to 53 \nbe volatilised (Brooke et al., 2008), although some will be sorbed to sewage sludge 54 \nduring waste water treatment, and subsequently applied to agricultural land.  There 55 \nwill also be an emission to surface waters in treated effluent.  In the atmosphere, D5 is 56 \nexpected to break down to silanols by reacting with hydroxyl radicals and is not 57 \nexpected to partition significantly from the atmosphere to surface media (Wania, 58 \n2006), although silanols may be removed from the atmosphere by wet deposition (e.g. 59 \nWhelan et al., 2004).  In water, D5 is not biodegradable but does undergo acid- and 60 \nbase-catalysed hydrolysis.  Estimated hydrolysis half lives derived from experiments 61 \nconducted by Dow Corning (cited by Brooke et al., 2008) range from 9 days at pH 8 62 \nand 25 \u00b0C to 449 days at pH 7 and 9 \u00b0C.  D5 does not appear to be toxic to pelagic 63 \norganisms at the limit of aqueous solubility (e.g. Hobson et al., 1997).   64 \n 65 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 4 \nAlthough D5 has a very high air : water partition coefficient (KAW), the potential for 66 \nvolatile losses from rivers may be tempered by interactions with dissolved, colloidal 67 \nand suspended material.  Estimating the partition coefficient for D5 between organic 68 \ncarbon and water (KOC) is, therefore, very important for understanding its 69 \nenvironmental fate.  David et al. (2000) observed significant reductions in the 70 \napparent KAW of D5 measured in simulated waste water using equilibrium partitioning 71 \nin closed headspace vials.  They estimated an effective value of log (KOC) of 4.38.  72 \nMore recently, Whelan et al. (2009) showed a clear inverse relationship between the 73 \nrate of volatile loss of D5 and dissolved organic carbon concentration in open beakers 74 \ncontaining mineral medium spiked with Aldrich humic acid (AHA).  By fitting a 75 \nsimple dynamic partitioning model to the data, Whelan et al. (2009) estimated a mean 76 \neffective log (KOC) of 5.28  [log (L kg-1)].   This is very similar to a mean value of log 77 \n(KOC) of 5.17  [log (L kg-1)] reported by Durham (2007), obtained from OECD 106 78 \nbatch equilibrium studies on three different soils.  It is also similar to the molecular 79 \nconnectivity index estimate of 5.05 implemented in the KOCWIN software (Sabljic, 80 \n1987; Meylan et al., 1992).   However, it is much lower than the value of KOC which 81 \nmight be expected from single parameter linear free energy relationships (LFERs) 82 \nbetween KOC and KOW (e.g. Karickhoff, 1981).  Applying Karickhoff\u2019s relationship 83 \n(KOC = 0.41 . KOW) yields a log(KOC) value of 7.66, based on a log(KOW) of 8.05, (i.e. 84 \nthe most recent industry-derived measured value: Xu and Kozerski, 2007) although 85 \nthe LFER recommended in EU Technical Guidance (Sabljic et al., 1995; TGD, 2003) 86 \nfor \u201cpredominantly hydrophobic\u201d substances yields a log(KOC) value of 6.6 (Brooke et 87 \nal., 2008).   88 \n 89 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 5 \nOne potential problem with extrapolating the observed behaviour and derived KOC 90 \nvalue reported by Whelan et al. (2009) to the natural environment is that this 91 \nexperiment was performed using a synthetic medium with AHA.  AHA is a natural 92 \nhumic acid probably derived from coal (Latch and McNeil, 2006; Malcolm and 93 \nMacCarthy, 1986) and differs in quality (and hence sorptive behaviour) from DOC 94 \nderived from soils, from aqueous environments and from that found in domestic waste 95 \nwater (Malcolm and MacCarthy, 1986).  In this paper, we examine the relative 96 \nimportance of phase partitioning in natural river water using a combination of 97 \nlaboratory experiment and mathematical modelling. 98 \n 99 \nMaterials and Methods 100 \n 101 \nExperimental 102 \nThe experimental system was similar to that described by Whelan et al. (2009).  103 \nBriefly, the concentration of 14C -labelled D5 was measured at different time intervals 104 \nin open beakers (volume 0.4 L).  Each beaker initially contained 300 mL of liquid.  105 \nSix treatments were established, each with three replicates: (1) Millipore water, 106 \nstirred; (2) Millipore water, static (unstirred).  (3) River water filtered through a 0.45 107 \n\u00b5m filter, stirred; (4) River water filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter, static; (5) River 108 \nwater filtered through a 125 \u00b5m filter, stirred and (6) River water filtered through a 109 \n125 \u00b5m filter, static.  In those treatments which were stirred, identical glass-coated 110 \nmagnetic stirrer bars were used with a multiplace magnetic stirrer in a fume cupboard.  111 \nThe stirring rate was set at 150 rpm.  River water was collected from the River Nene 112 \n(Ditchford, Northamptonshire, UK) approximately 100 meters downstream of the 113 \nBroadholme WWTP (which serves approximately 188,000 population equivalents).  114 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 6 \nAt this point, the Nene has a mean annual discharge of approximately 4 m3 s-1 (more 115 \nthan a third of which is derived from treated waste water) and is considered to be 116 \neutrophic (e.g. Balbi, 2000).  It has also been significantly modified for navigation, 117 \nprincipally via the construction of a series of locks.  Further details are decribed in 118 \nBalbi (2000), Williams et al. (2003), Jobling et al. (2006) and Sparham et al. (2008). 119 \n 120 \nRadiolabelled D5 used in the experiment was kindly donated by Dow Corning.  The 121 \nmaterial had a specific activity of 120.5 \u00b5Ci mg-1.  This was used to prepare a dosing 122 \nsolution by dissolving 10\u00b5L in 1 mL of acetonitrile.  The concentration of the dosing 123 \nsolution was 1.584 mCi mL-1 (13.145 mg mL-1).  Radiochemical purity was estimated 124 \nto be ~97%.  As a suitable method for purification was not available at the time the 125 \nexperiments were conducted, and because of the volatile nature of the test substance, 126 \nno purification was attempted.  The impurities were accounted for in the model and 127 \nare not believed to affect the interpretation of the data. 128 \n 129 \nThe dosing solution (7\u00b5L) was added to the liquid in each beaker using a positive 130 \ndisplacement pipette just under the surface.  All treatments were at room temperature 131 \nprior to test item addition.  The experiment was conducted in the artificial light of the 132 \nlaboratory.  Although this may have resulted in some algal growth, with associated 133 \naddition of photosynthetic organic carbon to the system, no such growth was visible 134 \nand it is assumed here that photosynthesis was negligible.  Samples were collected 135 \nfrom each beaker at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after dosing (t0).  At each sampling 136 \nevent, triplicate 5 mL aliquots were withdrawn (mid vessel) and were counted with 10 137 \nmL of Starscint (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) in a Beckman-Coulter LS6000TA 138 \nscintillation counter.  Temperature was observed to be constant throughout the 139 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 7 \nexperiment at 25 \u00b0C.  The average pH at t0 was 8.01 \u00b1 0.01 and did not change 140 \nsignificantly over the course of the experiment.  At the conclusion of the study, the 141 \ncontents of each beaker were discarded and the beakers were rinsed with 10 mL of 142 \nTHF followed by 10 mL of acetonitrile.  Residual radioactivity in rinse solvents was 143 \ndetermined for 5 mL of solvent in 10 mL Starscint.  Residual radioactivity associated 144 \nwith the glass beaker and stirrer bar at the end of the experiment was always < 1% of 145 \nthe 14C present at t0 and there was no evidence of any settling out of solid residues 146 \nduring the experiment.  It was not possible to determine the extent of any association 147 \nof 14C with the beaker walls or stirrer bar during the course of the experiment because 148 \nno provision was made for sacrificial analysis.  However, this association is assumed 149 \nto be minimal. Organic carbon concentration was measured using a Shimadzu TOC-V 150 \ntotal organic carbon (TOC) analyzer.  No characterisation of the organic matter was 151 \nattempted.  The nature of the organic matter present will reflect its multiple sources 152 \nwhich include dissolved and particulate losses from soils in the catchment, 153 \nautochthonous carbon from in-channel photosynthesis and sewage effluent.  Treated 154 \neffluent accounts for approximately 30% of mean river discharge at the sampling 155 \nstation. 156 \n 157 \nModel 158 \nThe behaviour of D5 in the experimental system was described using a dynamic 159 \nmathematical model of partitioning and degradation.  The model is based on that 160 \ndescribed in detail by Whelan et al. (2009) and was solved numerically.  Only a brief 161 \ndescription is included here.

The 169 \nradiolabelled contaminant was assumed to be non-volatile based on observations of 170 \nresidual radioactivity in a number of pilot trials which was approximately consistent 171 \nwith the level of radiochemical impurity.  172 \n 173 \nHydrolysis was described using  174 \n 175 \nLhyd\nH Ck\ndt\ndC\n.=         (2) 176 \n 177 \nwhere khyd is a first order kinetic rate constant (h-1), t is time (h), CL is the 178 \nconcentration of radiolabelled D5 in the dissolved phase and CH is the concentration 179 \nof radiolabelled non-volatile hydrolysis products (e.g. dimethylsiloxane-\u03b1,\u03c9-diols i.e. 180 \nHO(Me2SiO)nH [n = 1 - 5]).  A value for khyd was assumed a priori based on a half 181 \nlife of 9 d (valid for pH 8 and 25 \u00b0C - derived from unpublished experimental data 182 \ngenerated by Dow Corning and cited by Brooke et al., 2008).   183 \n 184 \nThe only loss of radioactivity from the system was assumed to be via volatilisation 185 \nwhich was described using: 186 \n 187 \nLvol\nT Ck\ndt\ndC\n.\u2212=         (3) 188 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 9 \n 189 \nwhere CT is the overall concentration of radiolabelled material and kvol (h-1) is the rate 190 \nconstant for volatilisation i.e. 191 \n 192 \nz\nkk Tvol =          (4) 193 \n 194 \nwhere z is the water depth (m) and kT (m h-1) is the overall water-air mass transfer 195 \ncoefficient which was estimated by least-squares optimisation of the model on 196 \nmeasured concentration data from the controls (deionised water).  Note that because 197 \nthe KAW for D5 is so high, kT will be approximately equal to the water-side partial 198 \nmass transfer coefficient in the two-film resistance model of Evaporation (Liss and 199 \nSlater, 1974).  The relative magnitude of diffusive resistance on the air side of the film 200 \nwill be negligible.  Depth changes over the course of the experiment due to 201 \nevaporation of water (rate ~0.2 mm h-1) and sample collection were accounted for in 202 \nthe model via temporal adjustment of kvol and the concentration of organic carbon 203 \n(COC) in each beaker.  Equilibrium partitioning of D5 between organic carbon and 204 \ndissolved phases was assumed, i.e.  205 \n 206 \n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+\n\u2212\u2212\n= ).1.( OCOCL\nHNT\nL KCV\nMMMC        (5) 207 \n 208 \nwhere VL is the volume of the liquid phase (which changes over the course of the 209 \nexperiment).  After derivation of kvol (via optimisation on the control data), the only 210 \nunknown is KOC, which can be derived by least-squares optimisation of the model on 211 \nthe treatment data, given a measured value of COC.  Note that, strictly speaking, the 212 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 10 \nKOC values derived from the 0.45 \u00b5m-filtered treatments refer, operationally, to 213 \ndissolved organic carbon (DOC) : water partitioning (i.e. they are effectively values of 214 \nKDOC).  Whilst we recognise that there may be important systematic differences 215 \nbetween KOC and KDOC for many chemicals (e.g. Burkhard, 2000), the limited scope of 216 \nour experimental design does not allow these differences to be distinguished for D5. 217 \n 218 \nResults and Discussion 219 \n 220 \nThe mean measured concentrations of total organic carbon in the 0.45 \u00b5m- and 125 221 \n\u00b5m- filtered river water were 1.3 and 5.1 mg C L-1, respectively.  Mean measured and 222 \nbest-fit estimates of the 14C remaining in beakers over time are shown in Figure 1 for 223 \nstirred treatments and in Figure 2 for static treatments.  In each case (stirred or static), 224 \nthere is a clear difference between treatments, with significant reductions in the 225 \napparent loss rate in both river water treatments compared with the respective controls 226 \n(deionised water).  In all cases, within-treatment variability was generally low.  The 227 \nmean coefficient of variability (ratio of measured standard deviation to measured 228 \nmean 14C concentration for triplicate samples at each sampling point in each 229 \ntreatment, averaged by treatment) ranged between 6.1 and 13.5 % in the stirred 230 \ntreatments and between 2.1 and 6.7 % in the static treatments.  As expected, loss rates 231 \nwere slower in the static treatments, confirming that volatilisation was the 232 \npredominant loss mechanism.  The lowest rate for both the stirred and non stirred 233 \ntreatments was observed for the 125 \u00b5m-filtered river water, which had the highest 234 \norganic carbon concentration (5.1 mg C L-1 i.e. almost four times higher than in the 235 \n0.45 \u00b5m filtered water).  For the 0.45 \u00b5m filtered treatments, the increase in apparent 236 \nhalf life compared with the respective control was similar in both the stirred and 237 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 11 \nunstirred systems (at about 2.6 times).  However, there was a much greater difference 238 \nin the behaviour of the two river water treatments in the stirred system than in the 239 \nstatic system.  For the 125 \u00b5m filtered river water, the apparent half life in the stirred 240 \nsystem was about 8.3 times that in the control, whereas in the unstirred system the 241 \napparent half life was only about 3.3 times greater than in the control.      242 \n 243 \nThe model was able to describe changes in radioactivity in the experimental system 244 \nwell, particularly in the case of the stirred treatments (Figure 1).  Deviation of model 245 \nfit from the experimental data is expressed as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).  246 \nFor the control, the RMSE of the fits was 1.30 for the stirred system and 5.95 % for 247 \nthe static system.  The RMSE values obtained for the river water treatments are shown 248 \nin Table 1.  In the static treatments (Figure 2) the predicted temporal pattern did not 249 \nmatch the observed data for some points (e.g. at 24 hours in the case of the control 250 \nand, in the case of the 0.45 \u00b5m filtered treatment, in the initial stages of the 251 \nexperiment and at 72 hours) but overall the match was still reasonable. 252 \nDerived values for log (KOC), shown in Table 2, were between 5.8 and 6.33 and were 253 \nrelatively consistent (mean 6.16; standard deviation 0.25).  There was no apparent 254 \nrelationship between the value of KOC obtained and the treatment.  The lowest value 255 \nwas derived for the 125 \u00b5m filtered static treatment and the highest for the 0.45 \u00b5m 256 \nfiltered stirred case. 257 \n 258 \nTwo of the main sources of uncertainty in the derived values of KOC are uncertainty in 259 \nthe measured concentration of TOC and uncertainty in the concentration of 14C 260 \nremaining (characterised by the variability in the replicate measurements made in 261 \neach treatment).  Since the model is implemented as a numerical solution to series of 262 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 12 \nordinary differential equations, it is difficult to obtain confidence intervals using 263 \nstandard statistics without linearization.  Instead, the sensitivity of KOC to the 264 \nmeasured TOC concentration was evaluated by re-optimising the model fits to the 265 \nobserved radioactivity data (Figures 1 and 2) using 95% confidence limits for the 266 \nTOC concentration during fitting (rather than the mean TOC).  The coefficient of 267 \nvariation for repeat TOC measurements on the same river water was typically in the 268 \nrange 3 - 6.5%.  A conservative value of 6.5% was assumed here.  The ranges in 269 \nresulting values for fitted log (KOC) are shown in Table 2.  Note that using the upper 270 \nand lower 95% confidence limits for TOC results in a reduction and increase, 271 \nrespectively, in the derived KOC relative to using the mean.  However, the results 272 \nsuggest that the derived value of KOC is relatively insensitive to minor measurement 273 \nerrors in TOC concentration, typically changing by only about 0.03 log units.   274 \nUncertainty arising from inter-replicate variability in measured 14C concentration was 275 \nexpressed as 95% confidence intervals for the derived KOC value in each treatment 276 \n(Table 2).  These were calculated (using the t-distribution) from standard error 277 \nestimates of KOC, obtained from three different model fits on the data from individual 278 \nreplicates (rather than fitting on the mean values) in each treatment (Whelan et al., 279 \n2009).  280 \n 281 \nIn analogous experiments in which changes in radiolabelled D5 concentrations were 282 \nmeasured in an AHA-amended mineral medium (Whelan et al., 2009) the model was 283 \nalso able to describe concentration changes very well in the initial period of the 284 \nexperiment.  However, the rate of volatile loss appeared to decrease asymptotically in 285 \nall treatments, with an apparent relationship between the asymptote and the organic 286 \ncarbon concentration in the treatment.  Whelan et al. (2009) invoked a bound-residue 287 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 13 \nhypothesis to explain this phenomenon, based on a hypothetical slowly reversible 288 \nabsorption of D5 to internal sites within colloids consisting of complex AHA 289 \nmacromolecules.  In the data described here, such a consistent asymptotic deviation in 290 \nloss rate from first order kinetics was not apparent.  This could be due to the shorter 291 \ntime over which this experiment was conducted (72 hours compared with 120 hours in 292 \nthe case of the AHA experiment).  However, it could also be due to the nature of the 293 \norganic matter present in the respective systems.  This would also provide a 294 \nreasonable explanation for differences in the apparent KOC values observed in the two 295 \nexperiments.  Different types of organic matter are known to exhibit different sorptive 296 \nproperties and to give different effective values for relevant partition coefficients (e.g. 297 \nGauthier et al., 1987; Raber et al., 1998; Tanaka et al., 2005; Niederer et al., 2007).  298 \nFor example, significant correlations have been established between increasing KOC 299 \nand decreasing polarity index and a reduced number of acidic functional groups 300 \n(Tanaka et al., 2005).  Partition coefficients can range over more than one order of 301 \nmagnitude using organic matter of different origins (Gauthier et al., 1987; Tanaka et 302 \nal., 2005).  Terrestrial humic materials often have higher sorption coefficients 303 \ncompared to organic acids taken from aquatic systems.  Similarly, values of KOC 304 \nderived for AHA are often, although not always, reported to be higher than those for 305 \nnatural dissolved organic matter (e.g. Raber et al., 1998).  However, in the case of 306 \ncVMS materials, the type of molecular interactions which take place are known to 307 \ndiffer from many organic chemicals, which is why they possess such unusual 308 \ncombinations of partitioning properties.  The molecular interactions involved in D5 309 \nsorption to organic matter were explored using an Abraham-type poly parameter 310 \nLFER.  Such relationships account separately for the contribution of different 311 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 14 \nmolecular interactions to the free energy of molecular transfer between two phases 312 \n(Abraham, 1993).  They often take the general form for KOC: 313 \n 314 \ncVvBbAaSsEeKOC +++++= .....log      (6) 315 \n 316 \nwhere c is a constant, e, s, a, b and v are matrix-specific parameters, which depend on 317 \nthe difference in chemical properties between organic carbon and water (Nguyen et 318 \nal., 2005) and where E, S, A, B and V are so-called solute descriptors, which quantify 319 \nthe capacity for specific intermolecular interactions.  Specifically, they refer to excess 320 \nmolar refraction (E), dipole-dipole interaction (S), hydrogen-bond acidity (A), 321 \nhydrogen-bond basicity (B) and characteristic volume (V).  Matrix descriptors for KOC 322 \nhave been derived empirically by Nguyen et al. (2005) using 356 measured KOC 323 \nvalues for 75 chemicals in a range of soils and sediments.  Nguyen et al. (2005) also 324 \nreport regression parameters for KOW.   Solute descriptors have been determined 325 \nindependently for siloxanes, including D5, by Ahmed et al. (2007) using a range of 326 \ntechniques, including gas chromatography and liquid-liquid partitioning.  The above 327 \nparameters, together with derived values of log(KOC) and log(KOW) for D5 are shown 328 \nin Table 3.  The derived values for log(KOC) and log(KOW) were 5.5 and 7.75, 329 \nrespectively.  They suggest that the ppLFER is a reasonable predictor of log(KOC) 330 \ncompared with the measured values reported by Durham (2007) and Whelan et al. 331 \n(2009).  However, this value is somewhat lower than the values of KOC derived from 332 \nthe experiments reported in this paper.  There is also a discrepancy between the 333 \nppLFER-derived value of log(KOW) and the observed value of 8.05 reported by Xu 334 \nand Kozerski (2007).  Without an independent measurement of KOW it is not possible 335 \nto comment further on the validity of this estimate.  The solute descriptors shown in 336 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 15 \nTable 3 (Ahmed et al., 2007) suggest that D5 has negative excess molar refraction (E) 337 \nand near zero polarizability (S) but relatively high characteristic volume (V) and 338 \nhydrogen bond basicity (B).  These features might explain the lower apparent affinity 339 \nof D5 for AHA compared with the organic matter in water collected from the River 340 \nNene, which has mixed origins and which has a relatively high fraction of treated 341 \nwaste water effluent, if phase descriptors for AHA and river water organic matter 342 \nwere to be determined.  In any case, additional empirical work is needed to 343 \nunderstand differences in partitioning behaviour for D5 and other cVMS materials, 344 \nwith different types of organic matter in the natural environment. 345 \n 346 \n 347 \nImplications for Environmental Behaviour 348 \n 349 \nThe implications of different effective values of KOC derived from different 350 \nexperiments for the fate of D5 in river water were explored using an extension of the 351 \nmodel described above.  The model was solved to yield changes in D5 concentration 352 \nfor time-of-travel (i.e. the quotient of river distance and velocity) in a 2 m deep river 353 \nover 96 hours.  This corresponds to a distance of 138 km, based on a mean solute 354 \nvelocity of 0.4 ms-1, which is representative of river lengths in the UK.  Three 355 \ndifferent TOC concentrations (1, 5 and 10 mg C L-1) were considered with two values 356 \nof log(KOC): 5.28 (after Whelan et al., 2009) and 6.16 (the mean value derived here).  357 \nThe range of TOC concentrations is typical of the range reported in British rivers (e.g. 358 \nWorrall et al., 2004).  Equilibrium partitioning between the freely dissolved and 359 \nsorbed (suspended solid, colloidal and dissolved organic carbon fractions) phases was 360 \nassumed.  No D5 exchanges between the bed and banks of the river and the water 361 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 16 \ncolumn were considered.  This is reasonable if the system is in steady state, such that 362 \nthe bed material is in equilibrium with the water column (Schwarzenbach et al., 363 \n2003).  Whilst rivers clearly experience transient conditions during storm events, 364 \nunder normal and low flows the steady state assumption is a valid one for chemicals 365 \ndischarged continuously via waste water (Whelan et al., 1999; Facchi et al., 2007).  366 \nValues for the partial mass transfer coefficients in the two-film resistance model for 367 \nvolatilisation (e.g. Mackay, 2001) were set at 0.05 and 5 m h-1, respectively, for the 368 \nwater (kW) and air (kA) sides, as recommended in EU Technical Guidance (TGD, 369 \n2003).  Again, it should be noted that for such a high value of KAW, the value of kA has 370 \nno influence on the rate of volatilisation.  A hydrolysis half life of 64 d was assumed 371 \nfor dissolved phase D5 (representing pH 8 and 9 \u00b0C).  Over the four-day time-of-372 \ntravel considered here, hydrolysis was always a relatively unimportant contributor to 373 \nD5 losses (< 4%), even in the absence of organic carbon. 374 \n 375 \nChanges in the predicted concentration of D5 in river water with time-of-travel are 376 \nshown in Figure 3.  With no organic carbon in the water, the loss of D5 is relatively 377 \nrapid with a dissipation half life of 27.7 h.  However, with increasing TOC 378 \nconcentrations, the rate of volatile loss decreases, particularly if a high value is 379 \nassumed for KOC.  The effective half lives for the high KOC scenario were factors of 380 \n2.07, 4.38 and 5.79 higher than for the low KOC scenario for 1, 5 and 10 mg C L-1, 381 \nrespectively, given an equivalent TOC concentration.  Volatilisation was predicted to 382 \nreduce D5 concentrations by 63, 25 and 13%, respectively for TOC concentrations of 383 \n1, 5 and 10 mg C L-1, in the high KOC scenario over a four day time-of-travel.  384 \nHowever, it should be noted that in real rivers concentration changes are likely to be 385 \ninfluenced by river discharge and depth variations (spatial and temporal) and by 386 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 17 \nchanges in turbulence (which will affect gas exchange), as well as by various 387 \nemissions from waste water treatment plants along the length of the river.  It should 388 \nalso be noted that KOC is likely to be temperature dependent.  Unpublished data from 389 \nDow Corning suggest that there is a positive relationship between KOW and 390 \ntemperature (positive enthalpy of phase change).  It is expected, therefore, that the 391 \neffective environmental KOC value will, in fact, be lower than that implied by the 392 \nexperimental data reported here since, except for the tropics, river water temperatures 393 \nare likely to be lower than 25 \u00b0C.  Additional empirical work is needed to verify the 394 \nriver predictions reported here, which should include a study to measure changes in 395 \nconcentration in the same mass of water with time of travel (e.g. employing dye 396 \ntracing) similar to that described by Whelan et al. (2007) for Linear Alkylbenzene 397 \nSulphonate. 398 \n 399 \n 400 \nConclusions 401 \n   402 \n\u2022 A simple model was used to describe observed changes in the concentration of 403 \nradiolabelled decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) in open beakers containing 404 \ndeionised and river water.   405 \n\u2022 Values for the effective log partition coefficient between organic carbon and 406 \nwater [log(KOC)] were estimated, via model optimisation, to range between 5.8 407 \nand 6.33, with an average value of 6.12 log(L kg-1).   408 \n\u2022 The model was extrapolated to predict D5 behaviour in an idealised river 409 \nreach under steady state conditions with different concentrations of TOC and 410 \nassuming different values of KOC.  The results suggest that although the rate of 411 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT\n 18 \nvolatilisation is retarded by higher values of KOC, water-air transfer is still 412 \nlikely to make a significant (>50%) contribution to concentration changes of 413 \nD5 over typical solute travel times in relatively shallow river reaches with low, 414 \nbut realistic, TOC concentrations.  415 \n\u2022 Additional work is required to quantify the affinity of D5 for natural organic 416 \nmatter of different origins and to develop a mechanistic understanding of any 417 \ndifferences observed.   418 \n 419 \n 420 \nAcknowledgements 421 \n 422 \nThis work was conducted at Unilever\u2019s Safety and Environmental Assurance Centre.  423 \nMJW is grateful to Unilever for additional support whilst at Cranfield University.
