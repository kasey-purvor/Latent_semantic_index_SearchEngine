Much of the work on technological discontinuities has \nfocused on macro levels of analysis such as industries and technologies rather than \nspecific firms. This study uses a historical perspective on Formula 1 motor racing to \nexplore the dynamics between firm level performance and technological \ndiscontinuities over a 57 year period. The study supports the findings of previous \nresearch that suggest that incumbent firms are often unable to adapt to the impact of \nexogenous shocks. However the study also reveals situations where a relatively small \nnumber of firms are able to sustain their competitive superiority through a number of \nsuccessive discontinuities. We suggest that, in addition to dynamic capabilities, these \nfirms possess sustaining capabilities - munificent resource configurations which \nextend the time available for firms to adapt to technological changes \u2013 thereby \nallowing them to remain competitive across discontinuities.  \nKeywords  \nTechnological discontinuities, innovation, historical analysis, competitive advantage, \ndynamic capability, motorsport, Formula 1 \n 2\nTechnological Discontinuities and Competitive Advantage:  \nA Historical Perspective on Formula 1 Motor Racing 1950 - 2006 \n \nThe removal of the competitive advantage enjoyed by incumbent firms in the face of \ntechnological change is a well established proposition in the literature on \ntechnological innovation and strategic management. The notion of competence \ndestroying technological discontinuities (Tushman & Anderson 1986) suggests that \nsuch changes can transform the competitive landscape in ways that often disadvantage \nincumbent firms. These discontinuities can create disruptive effects that undermine \nthe structure and integrity of the industry (Ehrnberg 1995), allowing new entrants to \nestablish innovative dominant designs (Abernathy & Utterback, 1978). As a result, \ndiscontinuities often stimulate high rates of innovation and market performance \n(Anderson & Tushman 1990). At the level of firm performance the highly potent \nresources that underpin the strengths of competing firms may quickly become \nweaknesses in the face of disruptive technologies and new capabilities evident in new \nentrants (Leonard-Barton 1995). Disruptive technologies are therefore more likely to \nbe created by new firms and incumbents often prove unable or unwilling to respond to \nthem by improving and even rebuilding their existing capabilities (Bower & \nChristensen 1995; Christensen 1997).  \n \nMuch of the work in this area has focused on industry and technology levels of \nanalysis, such as electricity (Hargadon & Yellowlees 2001), minicomputers, cement, \nairlines (Anderson & Tushman 1990), watches (Glasmeier 1991) and cochlear \nimplants (Garud & Van de Ven 1989). This is wholly appropriate where research \nquestions are focussed on technological shifts and rates of technological development, \n 3\nbut it is less useful when research questions are concerned with how firms perform \nand the nature of the competitive advantage that generates this performance. \n \nSome studies have looked specifically at the firm level of analysis. For example, \nRothaermel\u2019s (2000) study of firms in the biotechnology sector showed that \ncollaboration can counter the impact of disruptive technologies on incumbent firms. \nTripsas and Gavetti (2000) focussed on a single firm in their study of how the \nPolaroid Corporation attempted (and failed) to shift from analogue to digital imaging. \nIn a similar vein Henderson and Clark (1990) and Rosenbloom and Christensen (1994) \nanalysed the role of managerial mindsets and established business models in \nexplaining why incumbent firms were unable to respond adequately to technological \nchallenges from new entrants.  Such studies are important contributions to our \nunderstanding of the dynamics of technological discontinuities, but they typically \nfocus on internal barriers to change rather than considering the interplay between \nincumbent firms and new entrants in dealing with technological discontinuities and \nfighting for competitive advantage. \n \nA historical perspective on the development of industries and firms offers the \nopportunity for us to consider the impact of such discontinuities at the firm level of \nanalysis, while also considering the interplay between incumbent firms and new \nentrants. This is an area of particular interest when looking at how organisations adapt \nand create new resources to deal with changing environments through dynamic \ncapabilities (Teece, Pisano & Shuen 1997) and ambidexterity (Gibson & Birkinshaw \n2004) \u2013 where firms are simultaneously able to exploit existing resources and explore \nfuture sources of advantage. It also relates to the notion of time based competition \n 4\nwhere organisations need to speed up their change processes relative to environmental \nshifts, and those of their competitors (Eisenhardt 1989; Fine 1998). \n \nIn order to explore the interplay between technological discontinuities and \ncompetitive performance we have focused on the specialist area of Formula 1 (F1) \nmotor racing. F1 provides a unique opportunity to explore the competitive \nperformance of complex organisations. F1 firms design, manufacture and race their \nown cars and require a balance of technology, capital and human resources to achieve \na very clear performance outcome. Furthermore the increasing levels of technological \nchange which have characterised this sector (Read 1997; Wright 2001) provide an \nappropriately turbulent context in which to consider the changing nature of \ncompetitive advantage. F1 teams have to both develop their own innovations and \nimitate those of their competitors to remain competitive. It is this continual pressure to \nbe aligned to the existing environment and to adapt to future environments that makes \nF1 a particularly rich context to study competitive performance and change. Indeed, \nF1 has been studied to better understand organisational phenomena such as innovation \nand technology transfer (Foxall & Johnston 1991), technology trajectories (Jenkins & \nFloyd 2001), brand marketing (Verity 2000), clusters and regional performance \n(Henry & Pinch 1999) and also to extract general managerial lessons from its highly \ncompetitive context (Jenkins 2004; Jenkins, Pasternak & West 2009).  \n \nIn this study we focus on Grand Prix wins as the competitive outcome. The winning \nperformance of F1 teams has a direct impact on their value as a business, both by \nproviding sponsors with more exposure and by entitling the team to a greater \n 5\nproportion of the media royalties that are distributed on the basis of performance \n(Jenkins, Pasternak & West 2009). \n \nResearch Design \nThis paper is based on a detailed study of individual F1 teams or \u2018constructors\u2019 during \nthe period 1950-2006. This time period is chosen as it was from 1950 that grand prix \nracing was brought under a consistent set of regulations to compete for an annual \ndrivers and constructors world championship. It also allows us to identify and \nexamine seven successive periods which are punctuated by technological change \ncreated by new regulations. We take a historical perspective to gain insight into the \nlong-term dynamics of competitive advantage and technological discontinuities. This \nis a historical account of an industry in which outcomes can be measured and \ncompared over time. We are looking for repeated patterns of industrial evolution that \ncan only be observed at historical timescales (Fine, 1998). A historical perspective \nallows us to explore the changes and cycles which can occur in multiple levels of \norganising (Callinicos 1995). Historical accounts have been used to promote \norganisational and managerial insights into areas of technological development \n(Hargadon & Yellowlees, 2001; Cusumano et al, 1992) and managerial perspectives \n(Tripsas & Gavetti 2001). It also allows us to explore emergent principles and to \nexamine the highly contextual relationships between exogenous discontinuities and \nfirm level performance. Some of the best examples of historical theory development \ndraw on single context cases (Allison 1971; Burgelman 1983). \n \nThe study utilises secondary data sources spanning a 57 year period. These include \npublic archives, accounts in specialist books and periodicals, autobiographies and \n 6\nmotorsport data records which feature information on race performance such as \ndrivers, car types, qualifying times and positions, race times and positions. In addition, \nten in-depth interviews were undertaken with team principals, technical directors and \nother influential individuals working within the teams during this time. The \nrespondents were selected on the basis of their involvement with major innovations \nand technological changes in Formula 1. These interviews were conducted between \n1998 and 2004 and were undertaken to explore a range of research questions all of \nwhich are connected to the broad remit of this paper. The interviews were focused on \npast events and therefore allowed the respondents to reflect more openly than in \nsituations where contemporaneous interviews may necessitate \u2018impression \nmanagement\u2019 (Hargadon & Yellowlees 2001). These interviews were transcribed and \nkey sections of the transcript were coded and analysed using a grounded approach \n(Glaser & Strauss 1967). Emerging categories and concepts were related to the seven \nperiods and enabled key issues and connections to be identified. Table 1 summarises \nthe respondents, their involvement with particular F1 teams and the timing of the \ninterviews. \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe analysis is constructed in seven periods covering the history of F1 from its \ninception in 1950 until 2006. Each period is delineated by a major change in the \nregulations for F1 racing which created a technological discontinuity and, with it, the \nopportunity for a change in the basis of competitive advantage. In some instances the \nchange heralded the demise of incumbent firms and the advent of innovative new \nentrants. The approach of using such exogenous regulatory interventions has been \n 7\nused to good effect as a basis for studying how organisations respond to discontinuous \nchange in the railroad industry (Barr, Stimpert & Huff 1992). \n \nThese particular discontinuities are selected as they cover both a significant time \nperiod and demonstrate an impact on the basis of competitive advantage by shifting \nthe relative position of the key competitors. The changes are defined by the regulatory \nbody the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile (FIA) \u2013 and have been introduced \nfor reasons such as reducing costs, improving safety, increasing competition and \nkeeping the technical criteria in line with external market trends. Table 2 provides a \nsummary of the major regulatory changes used to define the periods in the study. As \nthey are delineated by regulatory interventions the time periods are not uniform, but \nrange from four to fifteen years. These proposed interventions were shared with two \nindustry experts who confirmed their selection as being important milestones in the \ntechnological development of F1. \n \nINSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE \n \n1950 \u2013 1960: Engines, Italians and the entrance of the Garagistes. \nThis period describes a number of shifts in competitive superiority. It starts with the \nItalian dominance of the early 1950s based around large, 4.5 litre, twelve cylinder \nengines positioned at the front of the car. This dominance is threatened by the \nchallenge of Mercedes Benz which ends with their withdrawal from motorsport \nfollowing an accident at Le Mans. Ferrari, in particular, continue to dominate through \nto the late 1950s, but at this point a new threat emerges \u2013 the English constructors led \nby Cooper Cars. \n 8\nThe British Grand Prix on 13 May 1950 was the first event in the newly created \nWorld Drivers\u2019 Championship. It brought together a series of autonomous Grand Prix \nraces across Europe and the USA under the auspices of the FIA. It was attended by \nKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth and was referred to as \u2018Royal Silverstone\u2019 \n(Rendall 1993). Despite the patriotic theme of the event it was dominated by cars \ndesigned and built in Italy by Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Ferrari. All of these cars \nwere designed with the engine in front of the driver and built within a relatively small \narea around Modena in the region of Emilia Romagna in north eastern Italy. These \nwere primarily \u2018works\u2019 cars where the racing teams relied on the resources of their \nparent companies to fund their construction and development.  \n \nThrough the 1930s and 1940s Grand Prix racing had been the domain of the large \nmanufacturers such as Alfa Romeo, Mercedes and Auto Union, often supported by \ngovernment funding. Specialist operations, distinct from the core business, created the \nF1 racing cars. However, the actual racing activity was often undertaken by \nindependent organisations using the nomenclature of thoroughbred horse stables \u2013 \n\u2018scuderia\u2019 in Italy and \u2018\u00e9curie\u2019 in France (Lawrence 1998). For example, Scuderia \nFerrari (SF), founded by former Alfa Romeo works driver, Enzo Ferrari, began life in \nModena, Italy in November 1929. SF focused on the preparation and competition of \nracing cars for enthusiasts, thereby creating one of the first specialist motorsport \ncompanies. In Germany both Auto Union and Mercedes had been banned from racing \nfollowing WW2. However with the creation of new F1 regulations in 1950 and a need \nto develop a strong line up of racing cars, Germany were readmitted and Mercedes \nstarted to plan their return (Rendall 2000). The \u2018works\u2019 cars prepared and raced by the \nfactory or their appointed scuderia also competed with privately entered cars: \n 9\npurchased and raced by individuals who were either independently wealthy or had a \nwealthy benefactor. At the San Remo Grand Prix of 1950, there were six works \nFerraris, six works Maseratis, nine privately entered Maseratis, and a single works \nAlfa Romeo, which subsequently won the event (Lawrence 1998). \n \nThe early 1950s were dominated by Alfa Romeo\u2019s supercharged Alfetta 158 which \nhad been racing since before WW2 and had won every race entered between 1947 and \n1951. However the supercharged cars used pre-war engine designs that had very poor \nfuel consumption and were at the end of their development cycle (Rendall 2000). In \n1952 Alfa Romeo withdrew from F1. \n \nIn 1954 Mercedes Benz entered F1 with their own factory based team. The Mercedes \n196 Streamliner used state of the art fuel injection and laid the engine on its side to \nkeep the centre of gravity as low as possible (Lawrence, 1998). They were first and \nsecond in their first race: the French Grand Prix of 4th July. However Mercedes\u2019 path \nto F1 domination was halted in 1955 when motor racing\u2019s worst ever accident \nclaimed the lives of 81 spectators and driver Pierre Levegh. Levegh\u2019s Mercedes sports \ncar crashed into the crowd at the Le Mans 24-hour sportscar race. Mercedes Benz \nwithdrew from motor racing at the end of the year.  \n \nAfter the withdrawal of Mercedes, Maserati and Ferrari resumed their rivalry, with \nFerrari dominating in 1956. Difficult financial conditions in Italy led Maserati to pull \nout of F1 in 1957 (Beck-Burridge & Walton 2000). The predominant design \nphilosophy during this period was to position the engine in front of the driver, \nprimarily because of the problem of locating a large 4.5 litre engine. The leading \n 10\ndesigners of the time were engineers such as Alberto Massimino (Alfa \nRomeo\/Ferrari\/Maserati), Giaocchino Colombo (Ferrari\/Maserati\/Alfa Romeo), Carlo \nChiti (Ferrari, Alfa Romeo), Vittorio Jano (Lancia\/Ferrari). All of them were skilled \nengineers, but their background and primary expertise was in engine design, \nunderlining the Italian philosophy that car performance was based around the power \nof the engine. \n \nThroughout the 1950s a number of British motoring clubs had emerged racing hand-\nbuilt cars assembled from various components of standard cars and motorcycles on \nthe many disused airfields in the UK following WW2. These included locations such \nas Silverstone in Northamptonshire, which was an RAF Operational Training Unit, \nand Snetterton in Norfolk, the wartime base of the 96th USAF bomber group. Many of \nthe cars used in these clubs were manufactured by the Cooper Car Company run by \nfather and son Charles and John Cooper. They used suspension components from the \nFiat Topolino car to construct a chassis, along with a range of scrap materials from \nair-raid shelters, aircraft and boat engines, for this reason they were described as \n\u2018cunning blacksmiths\u2019 (Lawrence 1998). Cooper used a single cylinder JAP \nmotorbike engine to provide the power, the short chain drive to the rear wheels \nrequiring that the engine was located in a \u2018mid\u2019 position, directly behind the driver \n(Jones 1996). These cars were hugely successful and by the end of 1951 Cooper were \nproducing a car a week, an unprecedented volume for a racing car manufacturer \n(Lawrence 1998).  \n \nFrom these early beginnings Cooper progressed to F2. In F2 a 2.0 litre engine was \nused, but often the cars raced alongside the larger, more powerful 4.5 litre F1 cars.  In \n 11\n1958 the first race of the year, the Argentine GP, was won by Stirling Moss in a \nCooper Climax, beating the works Ferraris. This victory was the first time a mid-\nengine F2 car had won an F1 Grand Prix. In the same year a new British constructor \nmade its debut at Monaco. It was an inauspicious beginning for Lotus: they started at \nthe back of the grid, one car retired and the other finished last, 13 laps behind the \nleader. Despite the fact that the British built, mid engine Coopers were beating the \ncompetition, Lotus founder Chapman persevered with front engine layout, and it was \nnot until he imitated the Cooper concept to create the mid engine Lotus 18 in 1960 \nthat their fortunes changed (Crombac 1986). The Lotus 18 has been described as a \n\u2018scientific\u2019 Cooper (Lawrence 1998) since Chapman had used calculus to create a \nwell-designed space-frame. He explained why the design of a racing car needed to \nstart with the chassis rather than the engine in the following terms: \n\"If the starting point is the car rather than the engine, the point at which all \"grip\" is \nlost can be deferred by design that is aimed at keeping as much rubber on the road as \npossible.  The limit of adhesion is extended by independent suspension to all four \nwheels, which helps to distribute the weight equally and by designing a car that is not \nonly light, and structurally efficient, but also \"wind cheating\". (Chapman 1958, p72) \n \nChapman\u2019s philosophy put him in direct contradiction with the Italian F1 teams such \nas Ferrari. Driver Nigel Mansell, who had worked for both organisations observed: \n\"Enzo Ferrari believed that the engine was the most important part of the racing car; \nColin [Chapman] believed it was the chassis.\" (Mansell 1996, p126). Enzo \nFerrari initially resisted the trend being pioneered by the British constructors, whom \nhe referred to as \u2018garagistes\u2019 (Couldwell 2000) or \u2018assemblatori\u2019 (Beck-Burridge & \n 12\nWalton 2000), using the analogy that the horse had always pulled not pushed the cart \n(Nye 1977). \n \nDuring this period a number of factors can be discerned regarding the characteristics \nof technological development and the distinctive trajectories followed by different \nfirms. First is the dominant design of the Italian cluster based on powerful, well \ndesigned, proprietary engines, an approach that was also followed by Mercedes prior \nto its withdrawal from F1 racing in 1955. During this period an alternative design \nphilosophy emerged from the British constructors and, while it did not achieve \ncompetitive superiority during this period, it established its race winning potential.  \n \nMany of the firms which were evident in 1950-1960 such as Alfa Romeo, Maserati, \nVanwall and, to some extent Cooper, were unable to successfully continue beyond \nthis period. Of the firms that survived, Ferrari and Lotus went on to become two of \nthe most successful Grand Prix teams of the 57 year period. It was in this formative \nperiod that both of them established the managerial and design philosophies that were \nto sustain these organisations over multiple discontinuities. \n \n \nINSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE \n \n1961-1965: Chassis Technology dominates \nThe second period involved a shift away from the dominant design of engine based \ndevelopment to one which emphasized the construction of the chassis. New \nregulations introduced in 1961 focused on smaller power units which encouraged the \ntechnological shift to mid, as opposed to front, engine cars. This was partly in \n 13\nresponse to the need to encourage new entrants into F1 as it allowed cars based on the \nsmaller F2 regulations to compete in F1. The established engine manufacturers such \nas Ferrari, BRM and Coventry Climax all developed new engines to deal with the \nchange in regulations. The change also encouraged the introduction of two major new \nentrants, Honda and Porsche, who both developed F1 cars around new 1.5 litre power \nunits. \n \nBy 1961 the dominance of the mid engine cars was clear, and Ferrari had to build \nsuch a design themselves, which they did using a highly effective V6 engine. The \nDino 156 or \u2018shark nose\u2019 dominated 1961 and gave Ferrari a further world title. \nHowever during 1961 Lotus was working on a new design of racing car in which \nColin Chapman took chassis development a stage further with the Lotus 25 \nmonocoque chassis, first raced in 1962. The monocoque concept remains the \ndominant design to this day, and involves the chassis being formed as a structure \nfabricated from sheet material (aluminum was the favoured option at the time). This \nmade the monocoque lighter and more rigid than the traditional tubular space-frame. \nThe monocoque was not a new concept, since it had been the basis for aircraft design \nfor many years (Vincenti 1990), but it was revolutionary for single seat racecars and \nwas derived from Chapman\u2019s parallel interest in aircraft design (Crombac, 1986). The \nLotus 25 and its successor, the Lotus 33, won the world championship for Lotus in \n1963 and 1965. The advances Lotus made in chassis construction were in an area that \nwas a low priority to Ferrari (Nye 1977) and, as a result, they became increasingly \nuncompetitive and had to resort to imitating their British competitors. In 1964 the \nFerrari 158 was launched with a similar monocoque type chassis to the Lotus 25 of \n1962.   \n 14\nThe most popular engines amongst the British constructors during this period were \nthose produced by Coventry Climax. Climax produced powered water pumps for fire \nengines which required engines that were powerful, compact and light, the ideal \ncombination for a racing car application. A total of 697 \u2018racing fire-pump\u2019 engines \nwere built (Beck-Burridge & Walton 2000) and they enjoyed significant success on \nthe track when combined with a Cooper or Lotus chassis. However in 1963 the FIA \nannounced that the engine regulations would change from 1 January 1966, with an \nincrease in capacity from 1500cc to 3000cc for a normally aspirated engine or 1500cc \nfor a turbo-charged one. Coventry Climax made the decision in 1965 not to develop a \n3000cc engine on the basis that the costs would be prohibitive. This left Cooper, \nLotus and other constructors such as Brabham looking for an engine supplier from \n1966 onward. \n \nThis period represents a transition from the earlier technologies of the 1950s, which \ndrew on pre-war design philosophies, to modern concepts in racing car design related \nto the use of lightweight materials, low drag design and aerodynamics. This shift \nembodied both architectural and radical innovation (Henderson & Clark 1990) where \nnew component areas of technology are both introduced (radical) and rearranged \n(architectural) in a way that proved challenging for many incumbents to both \nrecognize and respond to. These innovative shifts meant that certain firms only made \nshort appearances during this transitional period (Porsche and Honda) and others \nwhich had been strong in the previous period now struggled to remain competitive \n(Cooper). In contrast, other firms were finding greater momentum and competitive \nsuccess (BRM), there were new entrants who embraced these new approaches \n(Brabham) and well-established rivals, Ferrari and Lotus had been able to both \n 15\nstimulate and adapt to these changes. These different patterns of performance suggest \nvery different resource endowments and different dynamic capabilities within these \nfirms. \n \nINSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE \n \n1966 \u2013 1980: The Ford DFV, the Ferrari Flat 12 and ground-effect \nThe third period contains one of the most influential events in the history of F1: The \nFord DFV engine was introduced in response to changes in the regulations on engine \nsize for 1966. The impact of this innovation was to create an entire swathe of new \nentrants, all based in the UK and all focusing on chassis and aerodynamic \ntechnologies. It also presented a major threat to those teams who had developed \nbespoke expertise in engine design and development. \nThe Ford DFV \u2018V8\u2019engine was first used competitively in a Lotus 49 at the Dutch \nGrand Prix in 1967 and caused a sensation by winning its first race (Robson 1999). \nThe concept was not simply about a better performing engine; the engine was also \nused as a critical part of the structure, substituting for a major section of the chassis, to \ncreate a lighter, high-powered racecar.  The Ford DFV was created by a joint venture \nbetween the Ford Motor Company, who funded the project, Cosworth Engineering, \nwho designed and built the engine and Lotus Cars who designed and built the Lotus \n49 around the engine. Given the extreme competitiveness of the engine Ford made the \ndecision not to give Lotus exclusive use of the engine and made it available to other \nteams in 1968. It quickly became the technological imperative for all the constructors: \n\u201c...for ten years that engine pretty well ruled the roost.  Anyone with enough \nmoney, and in the first year[1968] it was only \u00a37,500, went to Cosworth and came \n 16\naway with an engine that was capable of winning the next race.  That went on for \nmany years which is the reason why there are so many British Formula One teams,.\u201d  \n(Ken Tyrrell, F1 Team Principal 1968-1998). \n \nIn 1968 Lotus was joined by McLaren and Matra in using the Ford DFV. The \nBrabham team followed in 1969.  During the early seventies F1 was dominated by the \nFord powered \u2018kit-car\u2019. In this case \u2018the kit\u2019 included the Ford DFV engine, \nmanufactured by Cosworth Engineering, and the gearbox built by Hewland \nEngineering (Beck-Burridge and Walton 2000) with the chassis and suspension \ndesigned and manufactured by the constructor.  In 1969 and 1973 a car with a Ford \nDFV engine won every Grand Prix, the only time in the history of F1 that a single \nengine totally dominated.   \n \nWith these light, powerful cars, designers were increasingly searching for ways to \nimprove grip \u2013 the extent to which the car is able to transfer power from the engine to \nspeed on the track. One line of development was the application of aerodynamic \nprinciples using aerofoils or \u2018wings\u2019. If driver skill is excluded, the performance of a \nracing car is a function of three factors: the power created by the engine and \ntransmission, the drag of the car moving through the air and the grip provided by the \ntyres and suspension system to allow the power to be applied to the track (Wright \n2001). Wings on F1 cars enhanced grip by generating downforce from forward \nmotion, the opposite effect of the lift generated by an aircraft wing.  Wings were \nquickly adopted in F1 with Lotus using front wings made from inverted helicopter \nblades at the Monaco Grand Prix on 26 May 1968 (Crombac 1986). Both Ferrari and \nBrabham then introduced cars with rear aerofoils at the Belgian Grand Prix held at \n 17\nSpa-Francorchamps on 9 June 1968 (Rendall 1993).  This innovation diffused quickly \nthroughout the teams and by 22 September 1968, at the Canadian Grand Prix held at \nSt Jovite, every car on the grid was using some form of wing. \n \nThe availability and low cost of the Ford DFV meant that F1 teams, like Ferrari and \nBRM, who were vertically integrated - building their own engines and gearboxes - \nwere at a disadvantage. In response to the proposed regulation changes of 1966 \nFerrari had developed their Flat-12 engine, originally designed by Mauro Forghieri as \nan aircraft engine. This had 12 horizontally opposed cylinders creating a wide, flat \npower unit.  The late sixties were a difficult period for Ferrari, both financially and \ntechnologically. In 1969 it \u2018merged\u2019 with Italian automotive manufacturer Fiat. Fiat \ntook a 50% stake in Ferrari which provided a huge injection of cash to support \nFerrari\u2019s research and development activities.  This allowed for the construction of a \nprivate Grand Prix circuit at Fiorano, close to the SF factory at Maranello.  The \ntechnical team used this facility to engage in a period of intensive development \nfocusing on the Flat-12 engine.  \n \nThese increased resources and development time enabled Ferrari to leverage its way \nback to the top of F1, winning world championships in 1975, 1976 and 1977. Ferrari\u2019s \nsuccess led many of the Ford DFV teams to look to alternative sources of power and, \nin particular, to 12 cylinder engines. In 1975 Brabham reached an agreement with \nAlfa Romeo to supply a Flat-12 engine developed by engine specialist Carlo Chiti, \nwho had formerly worked for Ferrari.  In contrast, two other constructors, Tyrrell and \nLotus, retained the Ford DFV, but developed more radical chassis designs. Tyrrell \ncreated a six-wheel car with four small wheels at the front designed to reduce drag \n 18\nand enhance grip at the front of the car. In contrast, Lotus undertook a longer term \nproject that was to emphatically establish the importance of aerodynamics for F1 \nperformance. \n \nIn 1974 the unusually poor performance of the Lotus team led owner Colin Chapman \nto ask Technical Director, Tony Rudd, to revisit the entire concept of a racecar to see \nwhere performance gains could be made. Rudd, along with aerodynamicist, Peter \nWright, explored the prospect of producing ground-effect in an F1 car.  Ground-effect \nhad been developed as a theoretical concept, but its practical application in F1 was \nunproven.  It was achieved by a breakthrough in using \u2018skirts\u2019 -- strips down the sides \nof the car that effectively sealed the underbody area \u2013 and, as with many great \ndiscoveries, it came almost by accident. \n\u201c...the [wind-tunnel] model was so decrepit we started getting variable results.  \nIt would be modified so often, it was made of card and plastic and clay and tape and \nwhat have you.  We got inconsistent results and we couldn\u2019t figure out why and then I \nnoticed that the side pods were sagging. We thought maybe it\u2019s the gap at the edge \n[between the car and the ground], so we put some card down the edge in a little tiny \ngap and wumph!  We couldn\u2019t believe it!  We had to re-do [the test] four times before \nwe believed it.\u201d (Peter Wright, Former Lotus Aerodynamicist.) \n \nThe Lotus design proved to be the most effective technological change in breaking \nFerrari\u2019s dominance of the mid-seventies. The Lotus 79 won the 1978 world \nchampionship establishing ground-effect technology as a dominant concept in F1 and \nmany constructors subsequently attempted to imitate the design.  Since the majority of \nconstructors used the same engine configuration as Lotus [Ford DFV], their imitations \n 19\nfocused on a re-design of the chassis. However, Ferrari\u2019s commitment to a Flat-12 \nengine meant that it was unable to create the narrow chassis profile needed to locate \nthe ground-effect venturi (aerodynamically shaped tunnels which created the low \npressure area needed for ground-effect) on either side of the engine. The same \nproblem also applied to Brabham which had shifted to the Alfa Romeo Flat-12 in \n1976. In contrast the narrow Ford V8 was ideally suited to this application. \n \nThis problem prompted Brabham\u2019s Technical Director to position a large fan at the \nrear of the car in an attempt to create artificial ground-effect by sucking the air from \nunderneath the car.  The Brabham BT46B \u2018fan-car\u2019 was a product of this innovative \nperiod and won the Swedish Grand Prix in 1978.  Ultimately, it was banned because it \nwas deemed to be outside of the regulations and due to the potential danger of debris \nbeing sucked through the fan and hitting following cars. \n \nAs Brabham was attempting to find ways to achieve ground-effect with a Flat-12 \nengine, Ferrari appeared to ignore the phenomena and concentrated on developing its \nengine and chassis along the same lines as 1974.  However, its efforts left Ferrari \nhopelessly uncompetitive against the ground-effect cars.  \u201cMaranello\u2019s [location of \nFerrari factory] Flat-12, still a magnificent racing engine, is incompatible with \nmodern chassis. [Drivers] Villeneuve and Scheckter were competing in yesterday\u2019s \ncars.\u201d Roebuck (1980).  It was not until the appointment of Dr Harvey Postlethwaite, \nan English engineer who had already designed ground-effect cars, that the extent of \nFerrari\u2019s myopia became clear. \u201cEveryone else had them [ground-effect aerodynamics] \nfor years, but until I arrived [1981] it was quite firmly believed that they didn\u2019t exist.\u201d \n(Roebuck 1999, p29) \n 20\nWilliams Grand Prix Engineering designer, Patrick Head, imitated the ground-effect \nconcept developed by Lotus. It proved to be a simple, but highly effective \ninterpretation of the concept.  As the Lotus reached the technical limit of the ground-\neffect concept, the Williams FW07 was considered to be the optimal application of \nthe concept to a F1 car.  Williams\u2019 development of the technology was undertaken \nwith an emphasis on simplicity and reliability. Williams developed a championship \nwinning car for 1980 in the FW07B, a car which effectively took them from the back \nto the front of the F1 grid. \n \nAlthough ground-effect had created significant advances in performance, safety \nconcerns were increasing due to higher cornering speeds and situations when a \ncollision would send the car airborne when the ground-effect downforce was suddenly \nlost (Watkins, 1996). In 1980 the FIA announced that sliding skirts would be banned \nfrom 1981 onwards, and followed this up two years later by determining that all cars \nwould have totally flat underbodies. The ground-effect revolution was over. \n \nThe change in the competitive environment created by the Ford DFV engine \nsignificantly reduced barriers to entry and led to a flood of new entrants who were \nable to design and manufacture the chassis and aerodynamic elements of F1 cars. It \nmeant that a larger number of firms were able to produce Grand Prix winning cars and, \nas a consequence, this period saw the highest number of different Grand Prix winners \nas shown in Table 5. The period also underlined the evolutionary nature of innovation \nacross competitors with the Ford DFV creating the need for improved grip from \naerodynamics, which in turn led Ferrari to respond through improvements to the Flat-\n 21\n12 engine and, ultimately, to the development of ground-effect aerodynamics by \nLotus.  \n \nThe introduction of the Ford DFV stimulated the development of new capabilities, \nmost notably around the use of aerodynamics and specialist infrastructure such as \nmoving-ground wind tunnels. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this period was \nthat although it created many new entrants, it did not cause the immediate demise of \nincumbent firms. Ferrari, in particular, was challenged by these new technologies and, \nyet, its commitment to engine development throughout the Flat-12 design meant that \nit remained competitive and enjoyed one of its most successful periods between 1975 \nand 1979. We therefore see two areas of capability \u2013 engine development and \naerodynamics working off each other in order to establish supremacy, but neither \nbeing sufficient in isolation and therefore allowing different balances of these \ncapabilities at the firm level.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE \n \n1981 \u2013 1988: Composites and turbo-charging \nThis period saw the development of a new area of engine technology which, prior to \nthis point, had been regarded as an uncompetitive option. Renault had won the first \never Grand Prix (as opposed to F1 race) in 1906 and had a strong racing heritage to \ndraw on. Its entry in 1977 with a turbo-charged car was greeted with both surprise and \ncynicism by the incumbent teams. It was their belief that Renault\u2019s technology would \nnot challenge the established normally aspirated engines. \n \n 22\nThe development of ground-effect aerodynamics in the previous period provided the \nimpetus for a number of constructors to look at alternative materials to use in the \nconstruction of the car. Carbon composite had developed out of a variety of aerospace \ninitiatives in the USA, the UK and Japan into a new generation of super-stiff, \nlightweight materials by the 1960s (McBeath 2000). In 1976 it was used by Brabham \nin the construction of brake discs. Team Lotus had also become aware of the \npossibilities of this new material and developed a hand laid carbon composite \nmonocoque for the Lotus 81 which was first raced in March 1981. It was followed a \nmonth later by the McLaren MP4\/1 which became the dominant design in F1. \n \nJohn Barnard, McLaren\u2019s Technical Director, wanted to create a complete molded \nmonocoque but, in order to do so, a rapid shift in the current approach to \nmanufacturing composite materials was required.  Until that time, carbon-fibre had \nbeen used in small sections or had been hand-laminated, as was the case with the \nLotus (Crombac 1986).  The advantage of molding was that it would provide a more \ncomplete composite structure that would be stronger and therefore could be of a \nlighter construction.  However the molding process required access to a large \nspecialist oven or autoclave. Despite leading-edge work being undertaken in the UK \naerospace industry, there was no interest in this kind of project from the established \nUK companies and Barnard had to look further afield, eventually finding aerospace \ntechnology firm Hercules in Salt Lake City, USA. The molding process enabled the \ncompletion of the first Project Four McLaren: the MP4\/1 that was raced in April 1981.  \nThe fact that McLaren had developed the first molded monocoque gave it a major \ntechnological advantage that contributed to its winning the 1984 and 1985 World \n 23\nChampionships. More than twenty years later every F1 car is still constructed using a \nmolded carbon composite monocoque. \n \nIn 1977 Renault had entered F1 as a manufacturer developing both the chassis and \nengine themselves. Unusually at the time Renault had decided to build a 1.5 litre \nturbocharged engine, a specification that had existed in the regulations since 1966, but \nhad not been considered a competitive option. It took Renault until 1979 to win a \nGrand Prix and, although it was unable to win a world championship before \nwithdrawing from F1 in 1985, it had performed sufficiently well to encourage other \nmanufacturers such as Ferrari, Honda, Porsche and BMW to develop their own \nturbocharged F1 engines.  \n \nHonda entered F1 as an engine manufacturer in 1983 in partnership with Williams, \nhaving previously entered as a full manufacturer to take advantage of the regulation \nchanges in 1961 (Hilton, 1989).  Importantly the engines were supported by a \nsignificant commitment from Honda in terms of both people and resources. They used \nthe relationship as an opportunity to develop some of their most talented engineers \nand to transfer F1 design and development capabilities to their production car \nprogramme. In the mid eighties the Williams\/Honda partnership was very successful, \nbut at the end of 1986 it moved to supply both McLaren and Lotus for the 1987 \nseason. By the end of the year it had dropped Lotus to focus solely on McLaren.   \n \nIn 1988 the Honda powered McLaren MP4\/4 car was the fastest and most reliable car \non the circuit, winning an unprecedented 15 out of 16 Grand Prix.  \n \n 24\nEscalation in the performance of the turbo-charged engines was causing concerns \nboth in terms of safety and costs. Teams were using a single engine specifically for \nqualifying for the race in excess of 1200 horsepower; these engines were designed to \nlast for only a few laps and an alternative specification engine would be used for the \nrace itself. Various regulations had been introduced to reduce the power and \nperformance of the turbo engines, but their performance and costs were rising \ninexorably. In 1987 the FIA made the decision that, from the 1989 season on, turbo \nengines would be banned and all power units would be normally aspirated. \n \nThis period was in many ways the most significant in terms of shifting the balance \nfrom one set of dominant teams (Lotus, Brabham, Tyrrell) to a group of new entrants \n(Williams, Renault) and in particular new engine suppliers (Porsche, Honda, BMW). \nLotus went into terminal demise, marking the end of a team that had successfully \ncompeted across four competitive periods. For many the reason for its inability to \nadapt to the turbo era was the loss of its entrepreneurial founder, Colin Chapman, who \nhad died from a heart attack in 1982. In contrast, a number of teams were able to \nmake a very successful transition to the turbo era: Ferrari had been developing turbo \ntechnology since Renault entered F1 in 1977 and McLaren was particularly successful \nin working with new suppliers such as Porsche and Honda to maintain its competitive \nposition. \n \nINSERT TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE \n \n1989 \u2013 1993: Driver aids and the gizmo car \nThis period saw the continued domination of McLaren which continued its success \nfrom the previous period by finding new engine partners following the withdrawal of \n 25\nHonda. However, sources of competitive advantage shifted from the engine to control \nsystems and related technologies, placing the emphasis on enhancing the ability of the \ncar to respond to the various inputs provided by the driver.  \n \nThe McLaren Honda combination dominated F1 from 1988 through 1991. However, \nin September 1992, Honda confirmed that it was pulling out of F1 racing, bringing its \ndomination to an end. Williams had resurrected its fortunes by creating an alliance \nwith Renault to supply engines and focussed on creating competitive advantage \nthrough a range of innovations on the car. These included the adoption of semi-\nautomatic gearboxes (originally developed by Ferrari), drive-by-wire technology and \nits own active suspension system (Lotus had also developed its own system at the \nsame time).  As a senior manager at Williams F1 put it: \n\u201cI think we actually were better able to exploit the technology that was \navailable and led that technology revolution.  We were better able to exploit it to the \nfull, before the others caught up\u2026 it wasn\u2019t just one thing but a combination of ten \nthings, each one giving you another 200\/300th of a second, if you add them up you a \nget a couple of seconds of advantage.\u201d (David Williams, General Manager Williams \nF1 1999). \n \nThe Williams FW14B of 1992 won the first eight Grand Prix of the season which led \nto a second successful period for the constructor. However, despite Williams\u2019 success \nwith what was often referred to as their \u2018gizmo\u2019 car, there was increasing concern that \ntechnology was replacing the skill of the driver. While F1 was undoubtedly a \ntechnologically driven form of competition, many felt it had gone too far in negating \nthe role of the driver and other human factors. This led the FIA to introduce \n 26\nregulations in 1994 which banned the various forms of active suspension systems, \ndriver aids such as traction and launch control and re-introduced refuelling through \npit-stops made during the race. \n \nFor Ferrari this proved to be a particularly difficult period. Enzo Ferrari passed away \nin 1988 at the age of 90. He had remained highly influential in the operation of the \nteam up to his death and his passing meant that control of the team passed to Fiat who \ninstalled a succession of their senior managers in the team, none of whom appeared to \ngrasp the essentials of how different an F1 team was from an automotive \nmanufacturer. \n \nAlthough this particular period was relatively short, it was significant in the history of \nF1 since it involved a shift away from the core technology components of engine, \nchassis and aerodynamics to bring greater emphasis on the integrating technologies of \ncontrol systems which linked the component areas. These systems included, for \nexample, \u2018fly-by-wire\u2019 throttle systems, which enhance the link between the driver \nand the power of the engine, and active suspension systems, which enhance the link \nbetween chassis dynamics and aerodynamics. In this sense the period represents a \nhighly significant discontinuity which is underlined by the marked shift in \ncompetitive performance \u2013 notably the growing domination of McLaren and Williams \nand the relative decline of Ferrari. \n \nINSERT TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE \n \n \n \n 27\n1994 \u2013 1997: Growth \nThe subsequent short period underlined a different kind of transition for F1. The \nbanning of many of the driver aids from the start of 1994 meant that the basis of \nadvantage shifted again. The emphasis moved to engine power as the critical element \nand Williams\u2019 partnership with BMW, and Benetton\u2019s with Renault, meant that they \nmoved to dominant positions. During this time both McLaren and Ferrari were in the \nprocess of rebuilding their organisations, McLaren through a new partnership with \nMercedes Benz, and Ferrari moving to a more integrated and co-located approach for \nthe design and manufacture of their cars. \n \n1994 was a disastrous year for F1 with the deaths of drivers Roland Ratzenberger and \nAyrton Senna at the San Marino Grand Prix. Images of Senna\u2019s fatal accident were \nshown across the world and prompted widespread condemnation of F1 and its safety \nstandards. Ironically worldwide outrage also created global exposure for F1 and \nviewing figures climbed significantly through the 1990s with the F1 teams increasing \nin size by a factor of three or four due to the increased revenue streams (Collings \n2002). \n \nIn 1995 the Benetton team eclipsed the Williams\u2019 domination.  Benetton had \ndeveloped a car using many of the technological innovations used by Williams (with \nthe help of ex-Williams designer, Ross Brawn).  In addition Renault\u2019s ambitions to \nmatch Honda\u2019s previous domination of the sport as an engine supplier from 1986 to \n1991 led it to supply Benetton, as well as Williams, with its engines. 1995 was the \nyear in which Benetton and Michael Schumacher broke the three year run of success \nfor the Williams team.  \n 28\nThis period represents a further transition between the focus on innovative control \nsystems of the previous period to a more conservative ethos where the design \nregulations further reduced the opportunity for more radical designs. The amount of \nfunding for F1 increased significantly, thereby increasing investment in facilities and \ntechnologies which, in turn, underlined the commitment to particular technological \ntrajectories and related investment patterns. This was a period of strong growth and \nalso convergence to a dominant design. The organisations placed greater emphasis on \ngetting existing technological systems to work more reliably as opposed to \u2018changing \nthe rules of the game\u2019 through more radical innovations. \n \n \nINSERT TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE \n \n1998 \u2013 2006: Integrated operations and the car manufacturers \nThe final period was characterised by a further convergence in dominant design, \ndriven by further increases in investment by the car manufacturers and incremental \nregulatory changes in an attempt to reduce variation in performance and also costs. \n \nTowards the end of the 1990s a shift in ownership began to take place. Renault \nacquired the Benetton team in 2001. DaimlerChrysler bought 40% of McLaren\u2019s \nholding company and a similar proportion of their specialist engine supplier Ilmor. \nBoth Honda and Toyota also explored the potential of creating their own F1 teams. \nToyota entered F1 in 2002 and Honda became a full constructor in 2006 when it \nacquired the BAR racing team.  \n \n 29\nThis period was characterised in the first part by Ferrari\u2019s comeback to dominate F1 \nracing once again. In 1996 Ferrari recruited two times world champion Michael \nSchumacher from the Benetton team. It followed this appointment by hiring the two \nmain members of the technical team at Benetton. As had been the case at Benetton, \nFerrari split the technical roles between a chief designer, Rory Byrne, who had overall \nresponsibility for designing the car, and Ross Brawn, who managed the entire \ntechnical operation.  The new arrangement also meant that Byrne and Brawn faced the \ntask of building a design department from scratch which initially included around 50 \npeople who were based in Italy. One of the most important tasks for the new team was \nto take advantage of the fact that Ferrari made its own engines by integrating the \ndesign of the engine, chassis and aerodynamics as early in the process as possible. \nFerrari\u2019s historic emphasis on the engine was replaced by a focus on integration, \nsummarised by Ross Brawn as follows: \u201cit\u2019s not an engine, it\u2019s not an aero-package \nit\u2019s not a chassis. It\u2019s a Ferrari\u201d. (Ross Brawn, Ferrari Technical Director 1987-\n2006). \n \nThe rejuvenated team provided the basis for Michael Schumacher\u2019s dominance of F1.  \nIn 2000 Ferrari secured both championships, 21 years after its last world \nchampionship victory in 1979.  In 2002 Schumacher and Ferrari were so dominant \nthat a series of regulation changes was introduced to try to make F1 racing more \ncompetitive. \n \nIn 2005 and 2006 the competition became much stronger and, despite being \ncompetitive, Ferrari lost the drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 titles to Renault (formerly \nBenetton). Renault benefited from the rising talent of Fernando Alonso who proved a \n 30\nmatch for Schumacher. In 2005 changes in the regulations meant that tyres were \nrequired to last for the whole race which favoured the Michelin technology used by \nRenault and the damping device it had fitted to the car to improve the performance of \ntheir tyres. Ferrari was left struggling towards the end of the race on its Bridgestone \ntyres. In 2006 a more drastic change to the regulations meant that the constructors had \nto shift from 3.5 litre V10 engines to smaller V8\u2019s. Despite a much smaller budget \nthan some of its major rivals, Renault F1 was able to create a very effective F1 \npackage with the engine, car and tyres working together to outperform the major \ncompetition.  \n \nIn overall terms this period was characterised by the dominance of Ferrari, the only \nF1 team who had been involved since the inception of F1 in 1950. Ferrari\u2019s \ndominance was in part due to their ability to transform the organisation from one \nwhich had been a technological philosophy that focused on the engine as the primary \ncomponent of the system, to one which had become far more balanced between the \ncore components of engine, chassis and aerodynamics. In many ways this period \ncould be characterised as a \u2018back to basics\u2019 shift in which firms that focused on the \ncore elements and optimised their integrated performance were most likely to be \nsuccessful. \n \n \nINSERT TABLE 9 ABOUT HERE \n \nDiscussion \nThis study identified a total of 27 firms which achieved Grand Prix wins during a 57 \nyear period. Of these more than half (15) only did so during one of the periods \n 31\ndelineated by the regulatory changes identified in Table 2. An analysis of the \nperformance of the most successful firms over the entire period (Table 10) indicates \nthat only four of the 27 teams - Ferrari, McLaren, Williams and Lotus - were able to \nwin Grand Prix in more than three periods. \n \nINSERT TABLE 10 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe impact of these regulatory discontinuities on the competitive population was \nmore significant in some cases than others. In 1966 \u2013 1980 there were a total of 12 \nnew Grand Prix winners compared to the previous period; whereas in 1989 \u2013 1993 \nthere were none. Ten of the 18 Grand Prix winners in 1966 to 1980 failed to continue \ntheir success into the following period; whereas all of the five teams winning in 1989 \n\u2013 1993 did so. It can therefore be discerned that the identified discontinuities had \ndiffering effects on the competitive population at different points in time. In particular \nthe regulatory changes made in 1961, 1966, 1981 and 1998 appeared to have the most \nsignificant impact on competitive dynamics and the performance of individual firms.  \n \nAt the industry level these findings support Anderson and Tushman\u2019s (1990) assertion \nthat the entry of new firms during a period of ferment is contingent on how the \ndiscontinuity impacts existing competences, competence destroying discontinuities \ncreating a greater influx of new entrants. We see evidence here of some \ndiscontinuities creating far more new entrants than others. It is also clear from this \nstudy that exogenous discontinuities create shifts in the relative competitive \nperformance of incumbents, the resource configurations of some firms proving to be \nless effective in winning races.. Figure 1 presents a graphical illustration of the \nperformance of the top three teams in each time period from 1950 \u2013 2006. \n 32\nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE  \n \nIn the first period, 1950-1960, firms such as Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Mercedes Benz \nand Vanwall had their only Grand Prix wins, and Cooper enjoyed 13 of their 16 \nGrand Prix victories during this time. Similarly in 1961-1966 BRM scored 11 of their \n16 victories and both Porsche and Honda were only successful as full manufacturers \nin this period alone (although Honda later returned in 2006). From 1966-1980 Lotus \nwere particularly dominant as were McLaren, Tyrrell, and Brabham. Many firms \nenjoyed a single Grand Prix victory during this period including Shadow, Hesketh and \nPenske, all attributable to the availability of the Ford DFV engine. Renault\u2019s entry \nusing turbo technology created an important technological shift during the 1981-1988 \nperiod which also saw the further ascension of McLaren and Williams, whereas 1994-\n1997 saw the rise of the Benetton team. In 1998\u20132006 Renault became a strong \nchallenger to Ferrari and McLaren who had largely sustained their position from the \nprevious period. \n \nAlthough there is evidence that particular firms dominate a time period and then fail \nto adapt to new technological environments, we can also identify firms that have been \nable to adapt over successive time periods. In some instances, their success extended \nover four or five periods as was the case for Lotus from 1950 through 1988, for \nMcLaren from 1966 through 2006, and for Williams from 1966 through 2006. In \nother cases, teams managed to sustain their winning streaks for two or three periods as \nfor Cooper and BRM (1950\u20131980), Tyrrell and Ligier (1966\u20131988) and Benetton \n(1981\u20131997). These patterns suggest that a limited number of firms can deal with \ncertain kinds of technological discontinuities more effectively than others. There are a \n 33\nnumber of potential explanations for this finding. First, the type of discontinuity may \nbe framed within an established broad technological trajectory (Jenkins & Floyd, \n2001), making it less disruptive for firms that have a range of capabilities within this \ntrajectory, such as chassis construction and aerodynamics in the case of Lotus, \ncomposite manufacturer and recruiting bespoke engine partners in the case of \nMcLaren, and systems integration in the case of Williams. A second and potentially \ncomplementary explanation is that the architectural knowledge of these firms is \nsufficiently \u2018loose\u2019 to enable them to adapt across particular kinds of discontinuities, \nthe implication being that these firms are more adaptable and less likely to develop \nthe \u2018core rigidities\u2019 referred to by Leonard-Barton (1995). Such an explanation infers \nthat such firms may have a broader absorptive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) \nallowing them to recognise radical innovations and their implications more easily than \nother firms, suggesting that they have a greater capacity for building dynamic \ncapabilities during these periods. \n \nThe most intriguing case is that of Ferrari which was able to remain in the top three \nplaces in every time period, suggesting that some firms may hold unique resources \nthat enable them to remain competitive through many different technological regimes. \nFerrari dominated the first and last periods of this study with the number of overall \nGrand Prix wins being almost twice that of its closest competitor. However, in the \nperiods 1961-65, 1981-88 and 1989-93 Ferrari\u2019s performance was relatively poor. \nThis historical pattern suggests a different kind of adaptation than that observed in \nthose firms whose technological trajectories enable them to adapt between periods. \nFerrari\u2019s adaptation appears to be more radical and more emphatic in terms of \nachieving competitive advantage, although it made its shift over an extended period of \n 34\ntime. This is particularly evident in the shift between 1950-1960 and 1961-1965 and \nalso between 1981-1988 and 1998-2006, where Ferrari was able to survive between \nperiods when its major competitors did not.  \n \nOne potential explanation is that Ferrari is a truly \u2018ambidextrous\u2019 organisation \n(Gibson & Birkinshaw 2004): they are able to simultaneously align to their existing \nenvironment and adapt to changes created by discontinuities. However if we consider \nthe Ferrari story there are several examples that suggest it struggled to adapt to \nchanges such as the monocoque chassis and ground-effect aerodynamics, not \ncharacteristics that would be associated with a firm which is identifying and \ndeveloping such new concepts in parallel with existing technologies. An alternative \nexplanation is that Ferrari\u2019s strength of resources such as finance (from Fiat), the \nFerrari brand and its political skills in working with the regulatory body \u2013 the FIA - \nallowing it to better anticipate and influence the implementation of these changes \n(Yates, 1991) - enabled it to better weather these changes than less well endowed \norganisations. Ferrari did adapt but often not as fast as other firms and often in ways \nthat required greater levels of organisational upheaval and change.  \n \nOur findings suggest that there are two distinct sets of resources at play when \norganisations are able to sustain their performance through technological \ndiscontinuities. The first set allows for adaptation and change of their existing \nresource base through dynamic capabilities (Teece, Pisano, & Shuen 1997) but the \nsecond is a set of sustaining capabilities which provide the organisation with the space \nand time to make these changes and which are not available to other competitors. This \ncould be described as a form of organisational slack (Cyert & March 1963), where \n 35\nresources exist in excess of current needs to provide a cushion against environmental \njolts. However, the phenomenon we discern here is distinct in that it not only provides \na buffer protecting the technical core from the environment (Thompson 1967) but also \nrequires a change in the technical trajectory and related resource configurations to \nmeet these environmental changes. In this sense we see a combination of sustaining \nresources which are combined with dynamic capabilities in order to create the \ntransformation needed to change the basis of competitive advantage. Sustaining \ncapabilities give the organisation additional time to adapt relative to their competitors. \nIn effect they enable the organisation to slow down the clockspeed of the industry \n(Fine, 1998) relative to their own speed of change. This study suggests that, over the \nlong term, dynamic capability is insufficient in isolation to break through \ntechnological discontinuities. Firms also need sustaining capabilities to provide the \ntime and space necessary for them to reconfigure their resource base and to respond to \nnew competitors. \n \nOur study is inevitably limited by the particularly specialist context that we have \nchosen. Our view is that it has allowed us to explore phenomena which otherwise \nwould have been obscured by lack of data and transparency, however the \nidiosyncratic nature of this industry means that any attempts to generalise from this \nstudy should be made with care. Our data has also mainly been taken from the public \ndomain suggesting that there are private aspects to firm level performance that we \nhave not been able to access.  \n \n \n \n 36\nConclusion \nThis paper has used a historical perspective on Formula 1 motor racing to consider the \ninterplay between technological discontinuities and competitive performance over a \n57 year period. Our findings are consistent with previous research that suggests that \nincumbent firms are often unable to adapt to the impact of exogenous shocks and that \nsuch shocks create opportunities for an influx of new entrants. The evolutionary \nnature of our data allowed us to observe more subtle shifts in relative competitive \nperformance between incumbents. The central contribution of the study is the \nidentification of a relatively small number of firms which were able to sustain their \ncompetitive superiority through several successive discontinuities. We suggest that, in \naddition to dynamic capabilities \u2013 which create new sources of advantage, these firms \npossess sustaining capabilities - munificent resource configurations which extend the \ntime available for these firms to adapt to technological changes.  \n \nThe concept of sustaining capabilities provides an interesting avenue for further \nresearch. We have used a highly specialised context to explore these issues, but \nfurther work could usefully explore whether the concept of sustaining capabilities \ncould apply to other firms and indeed other industries. In his work on clockspeeds \nFine (1998) identifies the differences between industries in terms of speed of change \nrequired, we are suggesting that such variability applies at the intra-industry level and \nthat some firms may have more time available to create new competences and \nresources due to their sustaining capabilities. This poses an interesting question \nlinking the work on organisation and industry evolution (Fine 1998) and the area of \norganisational slack (Cyert and March (1963) with dynamic capability (Teece, Pisano, \n& Shuen 1977). This also suggests that researchers may benefit from considering the \n 37\ninterplay between these different competitive concepts over time, a subject which \nwould particularly benefit from the kind of evolutionary, historical perspective that \nwe have adopted here.  \n \n 38\nTable 1: Interview Respondents \nRespondent F1 Team Involvements Date of Interview \nDavid Williams General Manager, Williams F1 -  9 February 1998 \nGordon Murray Draughtsman \u2013 Technical Director, Brabham: 1968 \u2013 1987 \nTechnical Director, McLaren Racing 1988 \u2013 1990 \n22 September 1999 \nJohn Barnard Technical Director, McLaren Racing 1980 \u2013 1987 \nTechnical Director, Ferrari 1988 - 1997 \nTechnical Consultant to Arrows and Prost F1 teams 1998 - 2001  \n5 May 1999 \n25 September 2000 \nKen Tyrrell Team Principal, Equipe Matra International: 1968 \u2013 1969 \nTeam Principal, Tyrrell Racing: 1970 \u2013 1997 \n20 January 1999 \nMartin Ogilvy Various Technical positions through to Technical Director, Team Lotus: 1978 - 1988 18 March 1999 \nMauro Forghieri Various technical positions through to Technical Director, Ferrari 1962 - 1987 18 October 1999 \nPatrick Head Technical Director, Williams F1: 1977 - 2004 16 February 2000 \nPeter Wright Aerodynamicist \u2013 Team Principal, Team Lotus: 1974 - 1994  9 March 1999 \nRoss Brawn Various technical positions at Williams: 1978 - 1988 \nTechnical Director Benetton: 1991 - 1996 \nTechnical Director Ferrari: 1997 - 2006 \n24 June 2004 \n \n 39\nTable 2: Major Regulatory Discontinuities in Formula 1 \nSeason Regulation \nIntroduced \nNature of Changes (main reasons) \n1961 Maximum engine size reduced from 2.5 to 1.5 litres.
