In this setting, blogs have \nreceived considerable attention with their alleged power to enhance democracy \npreoccupying communications and media theorists at length. \n \nAmong the key determinants of the democratic quality of blogs is their interaction \nwith traditional media and the profession of journalism.  Discussions of the role of \nbloggers as the new journalists and their authenticity as news sources have indicated a \nsymbiosis of blogs with mainstream media through which the latter can provide a \nmore interactive and healthier form of journalism. In an effort to offer greater insight \ninto the democratic role of blogs, this paper considers their ability to challenge the \nconstruction of meaning by mainstream media in situations of political conflict and \nwar. It develops a theoretical analysis by interpreting current evidence of the input of \nblogs in the news production process within the context of framing theory. Framing \nresearch enables a connection between news texts and processes of production and \nreception and highlights the construction of meaning as a product of framing contests \namong various actors and within a wider political context (Carragee and Roefs, 2004). \n 1\nIt provides a valuable conceptual tool for unpicking key underlying forces in the \nconstruction and impact of news and helps set out the premises on which blogs have \nthe power to dispute the framing of news by traditional media. \n \nBased on an examination of the news framing procedure as it unravels in situations of \nconflict and war, the paper theorises the ability of blogs to infuse the media system \nwith dissenting voices and frames that could change the media-government power \nrelations and the ways that western governments establish the frame of discourse in \nwhich conflict is understood. Empirical examples of reporting and commentary on \nsituations of conflict and war in the blogosphere appear to enhance this hypothesis, \nvalidating the power of blogs to turn the news media system into a greater \nconstraining factor for governments and an agent that is capable of facilitating conflict \nprevention. \n \n \nA brief description of blogs \nThe emergence of blogs (short for \u201cweb log\u201d) has marked the arrival of a \u201cnew form \nof mainstream communication\u201d (Rosenbloom, 2004, p. 31), one that allows millions \nof people to publish and exchange knowledge and information. Blogs can generally be \ndescribed as a more dynamic version of a personal website that is regularly updated \n(Wall, 2005) and as web pages \u201cwith minimal to no external editing, providing on-line \ncommentary, periodically updated and presented in reverse chronological order, with \nhyperlinks to other online sources\u201d (Drezner and Farrell, 2004a, p. 5). \n \nSeveral attempts have been made to identify the capacity of blogs to enable \nindividuals to establish an online presence and involve in a form of networked \nexpression of opinion (Allan, 2006). Through this online presence, citizens can \neffectively \u201cemerge from the spectating audience as a player and a maker of \nmeanings\u201d (Coleman, 2005, p. 274). Facilitating citizens to declare their presence in \nthe social production and distribution of knowledge could be conceived as the root of \nthe multiple influences of blogging on modern democracy, the most transformative of \nwhich is believed to be upon journalism (ibid). \n \nSo far, studies regarding if and to what extent blogs qualify as original news sources \nand platforms for citizen journalism have offered different and, at times, contradictory \nevidence of their position in the production and reporting of news. Although the core \nargument in the present work sprouts from the notion of citizen journalism, the paper \ndoes not intend to offer conclusive answers to this question. It addresses the blogging \nphenomenon in its deeper and broader sense focusing upon its power to create a more \nopen media landscape and a more democratic political reality. A somewhat narrow \nfocus is taken in relation to so-called \u201cnews blogs\u201d that offer information on politics \nand current affairs and are thought to have the greatest impact on mainstream media \n(Tremayne, 2007). Such blogs include those maintained by news organisations, by \nprofessional journalists outside news organisations and by individuals with an interest \nin politics and policy issues, often referred to as \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d blogs. \n \nThe potential of blogs to influence mainstream news media stems primarily from \nexisting knowledge about journalists and opinion leaders being among the consumers \nof blogs, through which they obtain meaningful analysis that helps them interpret and \npredict political events (Drezner and Farrell, 2004a).  Although only a relatively small \n 2\nelite of well known and highly influential blogs could attract adequate attention to \nfunction as aggregators of information and analysis, the vital force of the blogging \nphenomenon is among those who discover news and originate content. Hence, news is \nmore likely to start with a trend or event that is first noticed by a less-known blog, \nthen amplified by a social network until it comes to the attention of a power blog, and \neven enter the mainstream news media (Public Journalism Network). This paper \naddresses the potential impact of news blogs on mainstream media with the \nemployment of framing theory, through which it seeks to address key underpinnings \nof the news construction process that would exhibit the contribution of blogs in \npromoting greater political transparency and government accountability. \n \n \nNews framing and the challenge of blogs \nIn general terms, the concept of framing embodies the social construction of reality \napproach to the news media (Adoni and Mane, 1984; Berger and Lukmann, 1966; \nGamson, 1992, in Wolfsfeld, 1997). Often, it is associated with the principles of \nselection, salience and exclusion that \u201cenable journalists to process large amounts of \ninformation quickly and routinely [and to] package information for efficient relay to \ntheir audiences\u201d (Gitlin, 1980, p. 7). In what Carragee and Roefs (2004) describe as \nthe most significant contribution to framing research, Gitlin (1980) and Tuchman \n(1978) linked the production of meaning through frames to structural and ideological \nprocesses that involve journalists, news organisations and their sources (Carragee and \nRoefs, 2004, p. 216). Since news frames are not shaped in a vacuum but through the \nframes sponsored by multiple social actors, news stories become a platform for \nframing contests, where political actors compete by sponsoring their preferred \nmeanings. In essence, as framing sponsorship is determined by the distribution of \neconomic, political and cultural resources across the various actors, examining the \nmedia construction of reality through framing, necessitates that focus be placed on the \nrole of power in the production of meaning (Carragee and Roefs, 2004). The issue of \npower forms the basis on which the contribution of blogs is located. Seen by users as \nconduits to raw information that are less corrupted by power, blogs may constitute the \nantidote to the skewed representation of political reality offered by mainstream news \nmedia. \n \nBlogs offer an effective combination of expertise, real-time collective response to \nbreaking news, and public-opinion barometer. They can give journalists and other \nbloggers free access to first hand newsworthy information (Thompson, 2003) from \nmultiple areas, offering voice to a wider range of progressive groups and access to \nalternative interpretations. Considering that most news originates from standard \nofficial sources (Herman and Chomsky, 1988; Livingston and Bennett, 2003; \nSchudson, 2003), by exposing more and diverse voices, blogs can push journalists to \nricher sourcing, outside traditional halls of government and corporations (Andrews, \n2003). As Tremayne (2007) suggests, mainstream media can learn from bloggers how \nto take advantage of active citizen writers to generate a better product. The power of \nblogs in this case derives not from the accuracy but from the collective power of the \nreporting. The so-called \u201cRather-gate\u201d scandal offers a clear example (Tremayne, \n2007). When CBS News\u2019 60 Minutes II questioned President Bush\u2019s fulfilment of his \nNational Guard service obligations through the use of damaging memos, it was the \n\u201cbuzz\u201d generated by bloggers challenging the authenticity of the documents that \nprompted Dan Rather to apologise and announce his early retirement (Scott, 2007). \n 3\nThe credibility and impact of the information that bloggers provided was ultimately \ngenerated by the collective effort and its speed, rather than its depth, balance and \nobjectivity (Tremayne, 2007). Dan Rather\u2019s case underlines the power of blogs to \ninject an alternative view in mainstream news coverage through a combined effort. \n \nThe distinctive content often found in blogs that relates to, comments on, interrogates \nand analyses information already on mainstream media news (Kivikuru, 2006; \nThelwall and Stuart, 2007) allows blog authors to re-access current news material and \nproduce frames that divert from the official meanings traditionally sponsored by \npolitical elites. This is especially the case for blogs maintained by professional \njournalists, who use the blogosphere as a conduit to a writing that is free from \njournalistic constrains. These sites provide journalists with the opportunity to be \ncreative without worrying about compromising the objectivity that traditional news \norganisations try to maintain (Gilmor, 2003, p. 80), to shed light on how they arrive at \nthe opinions they publish (Regan, 2003) and even criticise newspapers and television, \nadding depth and thoroughness to current events (Matheson, 2004). Robinson\u2019s \n(2006) study of 130 blogs published within mainstream news media outlets in the US \nshowed that blogs could supply various interpretations of the day\u2019s news. Reporters \nwere able to let loose in some creative and interrogating writing, and build stories \nusing feedback and contribution from readers (Robinson, 2006, p. 79). However, it \nalso needs to be born in mind that journalists\u2019 independent writing in the blogosphere \nis not without constraints. A case in point is the war blog of CNN correspondent \nKevin Sites, which was one of the first to combine text, digital images, and audio to \nprovide readers with a behind-the-scenes look at the war in Iraq along with his own \ncommentary. The blog was eventually suspended after a request from CNN, a \ndecision that highlights the restrictions that journalists face as bloggers and implies \nthe determination of mainstream media to eliminate this new form of reporting (Allan, \n2006, p. 108). \n \nThe knowledge, experience and opinion of the audience can also be of great value to \nthe production of frames that divert from the usual sources. Many journalists who \nblog are exposing the raw material of their stories\u2013in\u2013progress, asking for the readers\u2019 \ninput to write follow up articles (Lasica, 2003, p. 73) and using the expertise of \nindividual bloggers on the issues of the day. Perhaps the most notable contribution of \nindividual, non-journalist bloggers to the news construction process is through the \nconcept of the citizen journalist. Citizen journalists are here perceived as non-\njournalists who provide news reporting in the form of complete and self-contained \nalternatives or supplements to the products supplied by the traditional media outlets, \nas well as reactions to news as the mainstream media report it (Cooper, 2006, p. 254). \nWhether these types of blogs engage in original news reporting - a question for which \nevidence is still scarce - is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, an imperative \ncontribution in the construction of news rests with offering insight, commentary, \nanalysis and dissenting views originally unavailable in the news media. \n \nA category of bloggers that fulfil this function are the so-called \u201cpolicy bloggers\u201d \u2013 \nbloggers who choose to specialise on a particular political topic. McKenna (2006) \nunderlines their significance by comparing them to the policy entrepreneurs that, \naccording to John Kingdon, constitute a central component to policy formation. \nMotivated by personal interests, entrepreneurs are willing to invest time, energy, \nreputation and money to promote a preferred policy that suits an identified problem \n 4\n(Kingdon, 1984). In a similar way, policy bloggers find a way to fit their expertise and \ninterests into news events, offering valuable analysis to journalists. McKenna cites the \nexample of the activity in the policy blog The Oil Drum when Hurricane Katrina hit. \nShe describes how its authors engaged in continuous writing and expanded on the \nimpact that such an incident would have on oil production in the Gulf Coast \n(McKenna, 2006, p. 23). The attention the blog received from the news media came \nas no surprise, considering the dissenting analyses and less \u201croutinised\u201d frames that \njournalists could draw from such writing. \n \nThe plethora of information sources made available through blogs, allows for a \ngreater number of actors to enter the framing contest that could gradually diffuse the \npower over news frames. At the same time, by incorporating the readers\u2019 responses in \nnews reporting through mainstream media blogs or drawing from the analysis offered \nin individual \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d blogs, journalists can enable alternative truths to \nmerge with their own definitions of meaning. The transformative impact of blogs in \nthe reporting of conflict and war, where the power relations between political leaders \nand news organisations are the primary determinants of frames, could not only prompt \ngreater frame parity, but also greater government transparency and accountability. \n \n \nThe framing of conflict \nIn an era when technology continues to modify communications and media systems, \nthe intersection of communications and conflict is pivotal. A growing body of work in \ncyber conflict, information warfare and media diplomacy has addressed the pervasive \nrole of communications technologies and the media in the formation of a more open \npolitical environment that can change the type of political strategies that work on an \ninternational level (Brown, 2005). At the same time, there are those who see media \ntechnologies as no more than tools in the hands of politicians rather than a force that \ntransforms diplomacy and foreign policymaking (Gilboa, 2002c). At the heart of this \nperspective lie the power relationships in which politicians and traditional media in \nparticular are involved. The issue of power that defines the framing of conflict by \ntraditional news media, serving primarily the interests of authorities and of media \norganisations, raises questions with regard to the openness of the political \nenvironment that communications technologies enable; and the constrains this \nenvironment entails for politicians in waging war. Within this context, blogs signify a \ntechnological development that, by diluting the traditional process of frame \nproduction, could prove powerful enough to transform the role of the news media \nsystem in situations of conflict and war. \n \nIn the study of frame production during conflict and war operations, the compelling \nwork of Wolfsfeld (1997) and Entman (2004) can offer a solid basis for the evaluation \nof the influential power of blogs. A central premise of Wolfsfeld\u2019s work is that \npolitical power offers important advantages in influencing the news media frames \nduring conflict. He asserts that the inherent importance of those with political power, \ncan lead to dignified frames, while progressive groups that divert from the official line \ncan only compete with their more powerful adversaries if they produce frames that \nresonate with the media\u2019s culture (Wolfsfeld, 1997, pp. 42-45). Wolfsfeld makes clear \nhow the power of political actors to shape news framing is embodied in their ability to \ninterpret events in a way that resonates with the media\u2019s political and professional \nculture. \n 5\n \nTo this, Entman has added the importance of promoting frames that resonate with the \nwider culture of a given political environment. In his cascading activation model, \nEntman (2004) introduces the concept of cultural congruence as the ease with which a \nnews frame will fit the schemas habitually used by most members of a society and \nwill be more likely to induce similar responses among the majority of these members. \nConsequently, a great deal of an actor\u2019s power to ensure their  preferred \ninterpretations are successfully adapted by the media and public alike, lies in their \nability to promote frames that are congruent with the schemas that dominate the \nrespective political culture. Culturally congruent frames tend to stimulate similar \nreactions by elites and the public, minimising the possibility for domestic opposition \nand rendering news framing easier for governments to control. They can prove \nprofessionally useful for the news media too, enabling journalists to process large \namounts of information and fit it in a culturally familiar narrative. Wolfsfeld cites the \nexample of the conflict between the Catholics in Northern Ireland and the British \nGovernment and its coverage by the American press. He explains how the frame of \nterrorism was established as culturally congruent and professionally useful, making it \nvirtually impossible to find alternative explanations such as the struggles by an \noppressed people against British occupation (Wolfsfeld, 1997, p. 34). \n \nAccording to Entman, the more culturally ambiguous a frame sponsored by a political \nleader is, the less sense it will make with the media and the public, paving the way for \nmore alternative perspectives to enter the news framing process (Entman, 2004). The \nimplications of ambiguous frames lie in rendering the anticipated reactions of the \npublic less predictable, reinforcing the media\u2019s role in representation (Entman, 2004, \np. 21) and, consequently, in holding governments accountable. However, the tendency \nof the news media to defer to the best-packaged official political story and frame \nconflict in accordance with a given political and professional culture leaves little \nscope for the media to provide the degree of transparency that can prevent conflict. As \nother areas of research have also demonstrated, democratic political structures and \ninstitutions, such as the news media, can even provide opportunities for political \nleaders to obtain benefits from war (Van Belle, 1997, p. 406). In effect, if power over \nnews framing creates a controlled communications and media system, by amplifying \npublic sources and voices, blogs may have the capacity to advance the democratic \nqualities of mainstream news media. \n \n \nFraming conflict in the blogosphere \nThe popularity of blogs in reporting conflict was boosted during the recent Iraq war, \nwith the blogosphere functioning not just as a news source, but also as a means for \nsoldiers to remain connected to their families (Palser, 2002; Seipp, 2002; Smolkin, \n2004). Not content with the one-sided news reporting of the conflict offered mainly \nby the US media, significant numbers of the public turned to the Internet for \ninformation. As Allan (2006) remarks, from the moment news of the first attacks was \nreported on 19 March 2003, Internet traffic increased dramatically. The demand for \nmore comprehensive coverage of the war led audiences to the search of information \nthrough news websites and blogs. \n \nAlthough, according to Pew Research, only 4 per cent of Internet users would turn to \nblogs during the Iraq war (Rainie, Fox and Fallows, 2003), Johnson and Kaye (2007) \n 6\nunderline the fact that their influential power exceeds their readership. Their increased \npopularity during the war was the resultant of featuring writers with varied political \nperspectives that offered insights different from those of the American traditional \nmedia (Hamilton, 2003; Hastings, 2003; Reynolds, 2004). They also provided links to \nother sites and allowed readers to respond to the postings, enabling a healthy debate \nabout the war (Hastings, 2003). Their influential power becomes even more apparent, \nwhen one considers the efforts of the military to censor or shut down several blogs \nposted by soldiers in Iraq for fear they would contradict the Pentagon\u2019s official \nversion of events (Schulman, 2005, in Johnson and Kaye, 2007, p. 165). \n \nAn even more profound impact of the blogosphere could perhaps lie beneath the \nreporting of the war by the US mainstream media. Although media coverage in the \nUS may not have been very efficient in elevating sources outside official Washington \npower circles and posing a serious challenge to official stories, the frame promoted by \nthe Bush administration - to build a case for the US invasion of Iraq - remained \nambiguous enough to create some space for a few opposition voices. This enabled a \nframing of the war that, overall, was less controlled than in past operations (Bennett et \nal., 2007; Entman 2004). \n \nThe Iraq war is not the only example where mainstream media and blogs offered \ncontradicting coverage. As Murilo (2006) points out, with reference to the East Timor \ncrisis, the Anglophone media would report a different story from Portuguese language \nblogs. The latter expanded awareness of the many sides of the conflict, bringing the \ngaps in interpretation within the different language spheres into high visibility.  \nConsidering the reported dependency of journalists on blogs for news and analysis \nthey did not see elsewhere (Reynolds, 2004), blogs cannot but reinforce the \nanticipated impact of their challenging voices and views on the framing of the war by \nmainstream media. \n \nBased on current theoretical and empirical evidence from the blogosphere, the \nfollowing paragraphs attempt to build a theoretical case of the why and how blogs can \nenable the diffusion of control over news frames during conflict and create scope for a \nmore transparent and democratic political environment. The core argument lies in the \nability of blogs to make a wide range of sources accessible to mainstream media, \nrepresenting voices that are distanced from political power and able to provide \nintelligent commentary without sponsorship of a corporate news company. This does \nnot only enhance their credibility (Kaye and Johnson, 2004; Wall, 2005, p. 165), but \nalso gives them the potential to erode the barrier of political power that blocks \nalternative voices from entering the framing contests. Considering that political power \ntranslates into one\u2019s ability to sponsor news frames that resonate with the wider \npolitical context and the media\u2019s professional culture, challenging the issue of power \ncould consequently enable a frame diversity that is central to the creation of a more \ndemocratic media and political environment. \n \nChallenging procedural framing: alternative voices, alternative frames \nEmpirical evidence of the multiplication of the sources cited and quoted in blogs \nduring the Iraq War 2003 offers some first indication of the diversity of frames that \ncould de-centre the process of news media coverage. In a content analysis of \nnewspapers and blogs covering the operation, Vaina (2007) examined five major \nnewspapers and six popular political blogs and counted the number of sources they \n 7\ncited over seven days in late March 2007. Overall, he found that blogs included a \nhigher number of total sources and a slightly wider range of sources. Even if the gap \nbetween newspapers and blogs was considerably narrower when evaluating the types \nof sources, Vaina underlines the fact that blogs were still more diverse in their \nsourcing. Hyperlinks offered another route for voices and perspectives to proliferate \nand dispute the trustworthiness of mainstream media during the Iraq war. Matheson\u2019s \n(2004) investigation of The Guardian blog demonstrates how linking to other \nnewspapers and sources from the Middle East, indicated the end of the monopoly of \nthe media\u2019s professional logic (Matheson, 2004, p. 459). \n \nAmong the most prominent sources that offered independent investigation and in-\ndepth commentary and analysis, were those knowledgeable and passionate \nprofessional and citizen journalists that participated actively in the coverage of the \nIraq war. Allan (2006) remarks on the number of front line bloggers that were not \neven associated with a news organisation but worked as \u201csolo journalists\u201d writing \ntheir own copy for online print and broadcast media during the war. Being always on \nthe move and equipped with mobile technologies, these bloggers became popular \namong blog users and distinctive news sources due to their ability to share their \neyewitness experiences, divert from official lines and the mainstream media\u2019s editing \nscrutiny and counterbalance the more traditional forms of the reporting of war (Allan, \n2006, 108-109). \n \nThe case of the so-called \u201csolo journalists\u201d resembles the self-styled \u201cunilaterals\u201d in \nthe Gulf War 1991, a number of journalists that decided to break away from the pool \nsystems organised by the military and get stories that were at variance with the \nofficial line offering alternative perspectives originally unavailable in the coverage of \nmainstream news organisations. Taylor (1998) underlines the contradictory views \noffered by the unilaterist version of events in comparison to the unanimity of the \nofficial line; but at the same time, he questions the effectiveness of this activity and its \ncontribution to a wider public understanding of the war. In fact, unilateral journalists \nwere only a small minority and their interpretations created more confusion than the \nclarity they had intended. With this in mind, the reporting of bloggers emerges as a \nunique opportunity for independent sources to provide more clarity to a conflict \noperation by multiplying the already existing alternative voices in its reporting and \nchallenging mainstream media frames in a more forceful manner. \n \nThe anticipated influence of this amplification of voices is embodied in the \n\u201cprocedural\u201d framing of an operation such as a conflict, once these voices get noticed \nby mainstream media. Procedural framing is described as the framing that focuses on \nthe process and politics of decision-making, in which case some aspects of a given \nprocess are selected and highlighted to promote the desired interpretation. This could \ninclude mentions of the president\u2019s leadership, attributions regarding consultations \nwith other leaders and comments concerning the manner that policy was formulated \nand carried out and it could also relate to the likelihood of military success or failure \n(Althaus, 2003; Entman, 2004). Procedural framing is distinguished from \n\u201csubstantive\u201d framing. The latter addresses policy decisions, such as unilateral \nmilitary action, conducting weapons inspections, opposing the option of war and other \nproposals, and the logic used to support and justify them (Althaus, 2003; Entman and \nPage, 1994; Herman and Chomsky, 1988; Mermin, 1999). \n \n 8\nThe so-called \u201cmilblogs\u201d \u2013 blogs posted by soldiers in Iraq - represent a useful \nexample of a potential source of procedural framing of events. Schulman (2005) \ndescribes the case of a milblog written by an Army infantryman named Colby \nBuzzell, who posted his account of a vicious firefight with insurgents on his blog, My \nWar describing the horror of the battle. Interestingly, the Pentagon ensured the \noperation received scant media coverage by playing down the extent to which \nBuzzell\u2019s brigade had been involved in the fighting. When a report in the Tacoma, \nWashington, News Tribune noted the discrepancy between Buzzell\u2019s version and the \nPentagon\u2019s, Buzzell\u2019s officers ensured his and other blogs were either censored or \nordered to shut down. The specific incident draws attention to the potential silencing \nof such blogs by officials fearing the exposure of information that would contradict \nthe government\u2019s line. Nevertheless, at the same time it illustrates the power of the \nalternative versions of the unfolding events, featured in blogs, to attract the attention \nof mainstream media and disrupt their procedural framing line. \n \nCooper (2006) cites another example of a blogger offering a dissenting interpretation \nthat could have potentially influenced later media coverage. He describes the framing \nof an Iraqi insurgent attack on an American military convoy, with 24 Iraqi insurgents \nleft dead, by The New York Times in March 2005; and how it was disputed by \ncommunication Professor Cori Dauber on her blog, Rantingprofs. Cooper explains \nthat Dauber\u2019s critique was triggered by the way the otherwise factually accurate story \nmisled the audience by framing the Iraqi assault as an unusually large and bold battle \nand glossing how they were eventually routed badly by the Americans (Cooper, 2006, \np. 106). Another misleading aspect of the story, according to Dauber, was the way the \nNew York Times reporter stated that morale was deteriorating among the Iraqi civilian \npopulation as a result of insurgent attacks. As Dauber noted in her blog, the story \nexplicitly concealed the optimism that prevailed among Iraqi people as well as the \nexisting polling data confirming this optimism (Cooper, 2006, p. 107). \n \nDauber\u2019s disputing of The New York Times frame offers a clear example of the \ndifferent procedural framing and interpretation that individual sources can provide, \nespecially when they are not limited by professional standards and\/or nationalistic \nincentives. Constructing a news story necessarily involves a choice of which facts to \nhighlight and which to play down. Since the frame is a central idea that organises the \nsalient facts in the story, disputing the story frame may take the form of highlighting \ndifferent facts that provide an alternative perspective of a key event. If critiques like \nDauber\u2019s create enough \u201cbuzz\u201d to attract the attention of the mainstream media, they \ncan prompt more comprehensive and transparent media coverage of the actual \nprocedures and outcomes in a conflict. This will be a crucial step towards hindering \ngovernment efforts to control the substantive news framing and public justification of \nthe legitimacy of the conflict in question. \n \nChallenging substantive framing: justifying policies \nThrough the multiplication of sources, blogs can give access to those dissenting \nvoices that divert from the culturally resonant beliefs and, using their expertise and \nknowledge, are able to recognise the existence of alternative justifications of the \ngovernment decisions made during an operation. Dissenting voices could entail a \nmore subtle criticism and disputing of mainstream media frames, challenging the \nproduction of substantive framing. Such challenge could comprise the promotion of \nculturally incongruent interpretations and justifications, and frames that do not fit the \n 9\nmedia\u2019s professional standards. Especially in situations of conflict and war, where \nnational interest could be under risk, the blogosphere can provide citizens with a \nplatform where they can publicly question the government\u2019s justifications of a \ndecision that might jeopardise the country\u2019s interest and dispute the framing of a \nconflict by mainstream media. Individual bloggers could in this case offer critique of \nmedia framing \u2013 be it in the form of disputing the frame of a news story, reframing \nfacts or re-contextualising a frame \u2013 which, as Cooper suggests, seems to be a natural \nresponse of the reader to news reporting that finds an outlet in blogs (Cooper, 2006, p. \n106). \n \nDrezner and Farrell (2004b) cite the example of Juan Cole, a Professor of History at \nthe University of Michigan, who channelled his expertise on the Muslim world and \nthe war in Iraq into his blog Informed Comment. Cole\u2019s scepticism about the US \ninvasion and occupation of Iraq diverted from the optimistic mainstream media \ncoverage. In the summer of 2003, he wrote, \n \nThe Sunni Arabs north, east and west of Baghdad from all accounts hate the US and \nhate US troops being there. This hatred is the key recruiting tool for the resistance, and \nit is not lessened by US troops storming towns. I wish [the counterinsurgency \noperation] well; maybe it will work, militarily. Politically, I don't think it addresses the \nreal problems, of winning hearts and minds. (Drezner and Farrell, 2004b) \n \nHis comments and analysis attracted wide attention from bloggers and journalists and \nCole began appearing on media outlets such as National Public Radio (NPR) and \nCNN to provide expert commentary. As Drezner and Farrell remark, \n \nCole\u2019s transformation into a public intellectual embodies many of the dynamics that \nhave heightened the impact of the blogosphere. He wanted to publicize his expertise, \nand he did so by attracting attention from elite members of the blogosphere. As Cole \nmade waves within the virtual world, others in the real world began to take notice. \n(Drezner and Farrell, 2004b) \n \nCole\u2019s example is noteworthy as the attention he received by bloggers and news \nmedia was the result of his expertise and implicit challenge of the official \ninterpretations of the decision to wage the war in Iraq and, by extension, of the \ncultural congruence of mainstream news framing. \n \nThe case of Jeff Jarvis, director of the new-media programme of the Graduate School \nof Journalism at the City University of New York, offers another similar illustration \n(Cooper, 2006). Jarvis attempted a substantial reframing in response to a New York \nTimes story on the suicide bombers in the 7\/7 London attack. Although the story \nconcerned a crisis event, rather than a conflict, the framing included elements, such as \na problem definition and cause identification, which are typical of the coverage and \nframing of conflict. Jarvis\u2019s critique of The New York Times story addressed the \nexplanation advanced by the newspaper for the specific terrorist activity, which \npresented the atrocity as the resultant of the despair of angry young men in Arab \nnations who have no hope of economic prosperity and freedom. Jarvis\u2019s objection to \nthe frame stemmed from observing that the London bombers did not fit that \nexplanation. In contrast, they were young men living in a land of freedom and \nopportunity, which in reality made them just murderers. Cooper cites the following \ntext from Jervis\u2019 blog: \n 10\n \nThe problem with the analysis is that though it does not justify their actions \u2013 it tries to \nunderstand them \u2013 it gives a tacit logic, even a justification to the horribly illogical, \nunjustifiable, uncivilised crime. What they did is a crime. That\u2019s all it is, nothing more. \nA crime. (Cooper, 2006, p. 112). \n \nTo support his reframing, Jarvis offered several cases of criminal acts and made a \ndistinction between understanding criminal motives and disregarding criminal \nbehaviours. These cases included manslaughter under the influence of alcohol, if \nalcoholism is treated as a disease, and corporate fraud, with the excuse that the \nperpetrator was raised in a culture of competition (Cooper, 2006, p. 113). The \nexample demonstrates how different media can offer conflicting frames of the same \nincident including different justifications of a given problem and the causes of this \nproblem. In the case of blogs, this could entail applying a form of implicit pressure on \njournalists to re-consider their own interpretations. By questioning the frame of the \n\u201cangry young man\u201d, Jarvis draws attention to what is perhaps the strongest asset of \nblogs: the capacity to engage in a more thorough evaluation of the causes of problems \n- such as terrorism \u2013 that could shed light on the deeper failures of a given political \nculture and attribute responsibility to those who are accountable. In situations of \nconflict and with the aid of traditional media, this capacity could eventually place the \npolitical realm under greater public scrutiny, facilitating peaceful resolutions. \n \n \nBlogs and conflict prevention: toward a more democratic news media \nsystem \nThe potential transformative impact of blogs on the framing of conflict by mainstream \nmedia can effectively reduce the ability of political leaders to have complete control \nover the definition and framing of events in conflict and war, and can contribute in \ngenerating a more public political landscape. This would essentially derive from their \ncapacity to allow audiences to blend with producers, reflecting a growing rejection of \ninstitutional authority (Putnam, 2000 in Wall, 2005, p. 167), and more importantly, \nenabling ordinary people to discover their own political voices and participate in \ncollective problem solving (Wall, 2005). The democratic relevance of this \ndevelopment becomes apparent when one considers the implications that an open \ncommunications and information ecosystem can have on political decision-making. \nInternational Relations (IR) theories can be particularly informative in this case. \n \nDuring the last two decades, IR has increasingly acknowledged the importance of \ncommunications and information in decision-making processes. The impact of \npublicity and transparency on human behaviour is of course hardly new with Kant \nbeing amongst the first to argue that the principles of human action could be ethical \nonly if they were public (Kant, 1963 in Brown, 2005, p. 58). Based on Kant\u2019s \nobservation that even if state leaders do not suffer personally from war, they suffer \nthrough the loss of office (Schultz, 1999),  Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman (1992) \nargue that an open political environment facilitates the unseating of a government that \nundertakes costly strategies. \n \nScholars of the so-called \u201cinformational approach\u201d, who deal with the issue of \nopenness encountered in democracies, suggest that domestic political institutions in \ndemocratic states facilitate the disclosure of information about governmental \n 11\nincentives and preferences in a given crisis and prompt the dissemination of more \ngenuine signals or threats (Fearon, 1994; Schultz, 2001). As governments become less \nlikely to engage in bluffing behaviour and misrepresent their incentives, the \npossibilities for a bargaining process to result in a peaceful solution increase. \nAccording to Siegel (1997), the news media are integral in this system. They \ninfluence decisions about conflict and war by taking the control of information out of \nthe government\u2019s hands and reducing the opportunities for deception. \n \nNeedless to say, to suggest that the news media system operates as a domestic \ninstitution that mirrors political decision-making and discloses government incentives \nand preferences in a conflict, thus preventing the adversary and the public from being \ndeceived, would imply neglecting the media\u2013government power relations and the \nskewed representation of events they produce. In response to this conceptual \ndeficiency, this paper suggests that studying the blogging phenomenon within the \ncontext of the news framing process is an opportunity to reconsider the role of the \nnews media as a truly democratic institution. \n \nThe conception of the news media as a domestic institution that offers transparency \nduring situations of conflict corresponds to the 19th century journalism ideal, which \nenabled rational observations and discourses by elites that held governments \naccountable and contributed to democracy. As Wall implies, it is this form of news \nmedia that blogs could help stimulate by pulling more people into public conversation \n(Wall, 2005, p. 167). As the discussion in this paper suggests, blogs provide the \ngrounds for greater news frame parity, multiple perspectives and alternative \ninterpretations of decisions and events. So long as blogs can attract the attention of, be \nacknowledged and utilised efficiently by mainstream news media, they can help \ncreate a media ecosystem capable of raising the cost of war for governments and pave \nthe way for more peaceful alternatives and a more democratic political process \naltogether. \n \n \nReferences \nAdoni, H. and Mane, S.
