The comment\nreflects the major strength of this book, which\ndoes provide an excellent starting place for\nanyone wanting to learn more about\nmultimedia. The author explains what multi-\nmedia' is today and the technology involved,\ngives example applications, and projects current\ntrends forward to explore the use of multimedia\nin the future. She clearly states the perceived\naudience for the text as 'business managers and\nproject leaders who need to introduce\nmultimedia technology into their applications'.\nA guide to using the text is provided: Parts I\nand III are suitable for readers with no technical\nknowledge; Part II requires familiarity with\ncomputer architecture, and Part IV is most\nsuitable for managers planning a multimedia\nproject. These guidelines are useful, but the text\nas a whole will appeal to anyone who has an\ninterest in learning about multimedia. Technical\nknowledge is advantageous in some sections,\nbut the author takes time to explain clearly, and\nuses examples to illustrate points.\nThe book is very well structured. The author\nprovides an excellent summary of the content in\nthe preface. This clarity of structure continues\nthroughout the text; for example, each chapter\nbegins with a brief outline of its contents and\nconcludes with a summary and references.\nMultimedia is a subject engulfed by acronyms\nand, to prevent confusion, the author provides a\ndetailed glossary which at times proves to be\nvery useful. A bibliography and a full index are\nfurther resources which the reader can draw\nupon.\nPart I, 'Multimedia Today', begins by painting\na scenario of a modern family using new\ntechnology in their everyday lives, then projects\nthe same family into the year 2001, highlighting\nthe role technology may play in their lives in the\nfuture.\nPart II, 'Technology', deals with the complex\nareas that make up multimedia, and is the most\ntechnical section of the book, dealing with\ndifferent platforms, development tools, storage\nmethods and the components that make up a\ntruly multimedia application such as images,\naudio and video. The chapters focusing on the\ndifferent media are divided into sections\ndescribing applications, capture, compression\nand standards, as well as detailing information\nspecific to each medium. A history of the media\nis provided, enabling the reader to see, for\nexample, .how standards have evolved. This\ntechnique of placing information within its\nhistorical context is used throughout the book,\nand is vital for a reader who may be coming to\nthe topic for the first time.\nPart III returns to the theme with which the\nbook began: 'Applications'. It focuses on\npresent use and future trends. Again the author\nplaces the use of multimedia in its historical\ncontext: the early use of multimedia was largely\nfor off-line training and education using\ninteractive videodisk and standalone players.\n72\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\nChapters in this section detail multimedia uses\nin training and education, kiosks, image\nprocessing, the office and the home. The author\ndraws on real world examples.\nPart IV, \"The Impact of Multimedia', highlights\nother issues that are important in the\ndevelopment of applications, discusses the\nhuman-computer interface, tackles legal issues,\nand identifies steps forward in computing that\nwill influence the development process such as\ncollaborative computing and object-oriented\ndesign.\nThe author says in the preface that she faced a\ncomplex task in writing the book 'because\nmultimedia is not a single technology'. The\ntechnology and applications are explained well,\nand recent research is used effectively to\nhighlight present and future trends. However, a\nreader looking for greater detail on a topic will\nhave to explore other texts. I would nevertheless\nrecommend this book to anyone interested in,\nor already involved in, multimedia. It is such a\ndiverse area that we can all benefit from what\nthis book provides: an insight into the parts that\nmake up the whole.\nJulia Little, University of Wales, Aberystwyth\nDavid Boud, Enhancing Learning Through Self-\nAssessment, London, Kogan Page, 1995. ISBN:\n0-7494-1368-9.247 pages, paperback, \u00a319.95.\nAt the heart of learning technology is a complex\nweb of ideas on learning; how teachers assess it\nand how learners can influence it. David Boud's\nbook provides us with a rich source of\ninspiration that should influence any learning\ntechnologist.\nCentral to education and training is a need to\nensure that students benefit from their time\nengaged in education and what we think of as\nlearning. After an effective class, learners can do\nand say things they could not have done before.\nThey feel they know something - and they are\naware of their learning. We have only a Slender\nconception of the mysteries of consciousness of\nperformance at present. How is it that we are\nconscious of what we know, and how is it\npossible to influence our knowing or not\nknowing? Often when, learners or trainees are\nasked 'What did you learn from such and such\nan intervention?', they can only answer\n'Nothing!'. To the courseware designer this is a\ncruel attack. The careful design of screens, the\nconsultation with experts and the attention to\nthe latest multimedia techniques will lead to\nknowing and an awareness of knowing. Not\nonly will the learner know, but others will,\nthrough assessment, be able -to judge the\nintervention as effective. Sadly, this does not\nalways occur. Although we have a very effective\nexamination and assessment system in education\nand training, designers often feel that assessment\nis not for them. Assessment is external to the\nprocess of design. Assessment smacks of formal\neducation - schools, Key Stages, Highers and A\nLevels: the external artefacts of a quality control\nsystem that we all have to suffer.\nBoud's book addresses issues of assessment and\nexamination, not from the outside - the\nobserver's view - but from the learner's point of\nview. Learning is a self-regulating process.\nAdmittedly, learners do not always see it in this\nway. Often they feel the only function of\neducation is to get them to the examination\nroom so that they can display their ignorance.\nLearning technology must address this problem,\nand this book is an essential guide to the way we\ncan produce more effective and efficient\nlearning experiences.\nAt the heart of Boud's excellent survey of ideas\non self-assessment is reflection or auto-\nmonitoring. Good learners are aware of what\nthey know and how they come to know.\nLearners who fail not only seem unaware of\nwhat it is they should know, but what they can\ndo about it. Boud has provided evidence and\nstories to give designers plenty of thought. The\nbook is not a single narrative but a number of\nmultiple perspectives on self-assessment.\nBoud can speak with authority: he has been\nwriting about reflection on learning for many\nyears. Currently he holds the position of Head\nof the School of Adult and Language Education\nin the University of Technology in Sydney. He\nworked in the UK in the 1970s, and after a\nsojourn in Perth, moved to the University of\nNew South Wales where he developed ideas in\nstaff development. He is a Fellow of the Society\nfor Research into Higher Education and 'weel\nkent' across higher education.\nThe book consists of 17 chapters. In seven of\nthese, Boud is ably assisted by other\npractitioners and experts in higher education.\nThe book not only provides the theory and\nresearch - with an extensive bibliography - but\nalso good examples of how the ideas are put\ninto practice. Boud has divided the book into\nfour parts. After \"Theory and Examples', Part\n73\nReviews\nIII makes compelling reading as it deals with\nissues relating to the effect of self-assessment on\nformal examination processes. The final section\nconsiders, in a down-to-earth way, the practical\nimplications for self-assessment. Here, I would\nlike to have seen more attention to the way\ncourseware designers - learning technologists -\ncan make a positive impact on learning. Too\noften I feel that designers are over-concerned\nwith presentation. They know about network-\ning and multimedia, but there is a 'correctness'\nabout shying away from assessment. Orthodox\ndesign seems to avoid assessment as it is 'other-\ncentred': something that the system will do to\nthe learner. If only we could build into\ncourseware, and other instruction, opportunities\nfor learners to reflect on their competencies, we\nwould be making a significant contribution to\nsuccess in life-long learning. One simple\nexample should suffice. Feedback on perform-\nance is essential for reflection to occur.\nFeedback has been shown to have a significant\ninfluence on the attitudes of learners to instruc-\ntion. Boud provides an excellent checklist on\noffering feedback, and although the advice is\ngeneral and global, if designers were to read this\nand to do something about it, learners would be\nbetter able to reflect on and influence their own\nlearning. Boud says: 'Be timely; be realistic; be\nspecific; be descriptive; be non-judgmental; be\ndiligent' - all things that good designers should\nbe.\nOften the best advice we can get comes from an\nunexpected quarter. If we feel that assessment is\nonly to do with authority and quality control,\nwe miss an important opportunity. Self-assess-\nment is at the heart of learners owning the\nability to influence their own success. Designers\nshould thus read and pay attention to David\nBoud in this excellent book. He is an\nacknowledged master of putting difficult ideas\nin straightforward terms. Acquire this book and\nmake use of it.\nRay McAleese, Heriot-Watt University\nIan McGill and Liz Beary, Action Learning,\nLondon, Kogan Page, 1995. ISBN: 0-7494-1534-\n7. Second edition, 274 pages, softback, \u00a319.95.\nThis guide sets out to provide a practical\napproach to action learning. Aimed at readers\nseeking to develop their personal learning\nthrough participation in action learning groups,\nas well as those wishing to introduce the process\ninto a wider educational programme.\nThe underpinning principles upon which action\nlearning is based are discussed in sufficient detail\nto provide a basic grounding, but the main\nstrength of the guide lies in its focus on the\nsuccessful practical implementation of action\nlearning sets. This includes not only guidelines\nfor implementing an introductory workshop, but\nalso for the range of skills required by set\nmembers to enable them to participate effectively\nas action learners. The authors aim to demystify\naction learning, and reveal its strengths as a\nmethod of personal learning and development.\nThe book is divided into three sections. In the\nfirst, the focus is on the meaning of the term\naction learning, and the presentation of an\nunderstanding of what it is to be an action\nlearner. This is then developed in the second\nsection, which looks at effective set membership\nand the types of skills needed to ensure that the\nindividual is able to participate fully in the\naction-learning process. The final second places\naction learning in a number of professional and\neducational settings, and shows how it can be\nused to enhance personal development and\nlearning in those contexts.\nIn Part I, action learning is described by the\nauthors as the 'process of learning and\nreflection that happens with the support of a\ngroup or \"set\" of colleagues working with real\nproblems with the intention of getting things\ndone'. In Chapter 2, action learning and the role\nof the action-learning set are defined, with\nparticular emphasis on the importance of the\nrelationship between action and reflection.\nAction learning is based on the principles of\nKolb's experiential learning cycle, which\nembodies the idea that systematic reflection on\nprior experiences can help in the generation of\nfuture ideas, plans and actions. A useful\ndistinction is made between action learning and\naction research in order to avoid any potential\nconfusion between the two approaches, given\nthat both are closely aligned with models of\nexperiential learning. Chapter 3 describes how\nan action-learning set is formed, and how it\nworks at a structural or organizational level,\nsetting the scene for the two following chapters\nwhich describe in detail what it means to be a\nset member and a set facilitator. The concluding\nchapter in this section is an examination of\ndifferent types of action learning.\nIn Part II, consideration is given to the way in\nwhich action learning can be introduced to\npotential participants. This section is very much\n74\nALT-} Volume 4 Number 2\nabout getting action-learning sets underway,\nand a large part of it is devoted to presentation\nof a format for an introductory workshop. This\nincludes a schedule and a set of suitable\nsupporting activities. The remainder of this\nsection describes the interpersonal and learning\nskills required by set members, which will\nenable them to participate fully in the activities\nof the group, and for the set to function\neffectively.\nThe final part of the book looks at the potential\nof action learning in the settings of continuing\nprofessional development, management\ndevelopment and higher education. The\nconcluding chapter in this section addresses the\npotential contribution of action learning to\nindividual, organizational and social change.\nIn the final chapter of the book, the authors\nexpress a concern that by writing a how-to text,\nthey run the risk of being too prescriptive and of\npresenting \u2022 a definitive approach to action\nlearning. This is not the case. What they do\npresent is a clear exposition of the underlying\nphilosophy of action learning, with a sense of\nthe boundaries within which it can be shown to\nwork effectively. The book presents action\nlearning in a clear and logical way, with a good\nbalance between attention to the underlying\nprinciples and the practicalities of being a set\nmember and\/or facilitator. This book is thus a\nvaluable resource, which will be useful to a wide\nrange of readers, from those interested in\nfinding out a little more about what action\nlearning offers, to those seeking more practical\nguidance in the facilitation of, or participation\nin, an action-learning set. The authors convey\nnot only a genuine belief in and commitment to\naction learning, but also an enthusiasm for the\ncontribution it can make to personal\ndevelopment and learning. It is clear that this\nbook is written by two people who care about\naction learning, and who wish to share the\ninsights gained from their own professional\npractice with a much wider community.\nSusan Fowell, University of Sheffield\nHigher Education 1998 Transformed by Learning\nTechnology, edited by Joyce Martin, Jonathan\nDarby and Bengt Kjoellestroem, published jointly\nby CTTSS Publications (CTI Support Service,\nUniversity of Oxford) and the Swedish Council\nfor the Renewal of Undergraduate Education,\nUniversity of Lund, 1994. ISBN: 0-9513896-6-1.\nSoftback.\nAlthough the art of prophecy is problematic;\ntime tells whether our view of the future has\nbeen rooted in the present. The art of prophecy\nis problematic because most seers are on a\nhiding to nothing. We live in a time of change,\nand merely predicting that change will come\nabout is a truism. The issues of interest are the\nrate of change, its nature and the vehicles by\nwhich it arrives on our doorstep (or gets lost en\nroute). Those involved in the promotion of IT\nand other forms of resource-based learning are\nfrequently driven by evangelical zeal, and are\noften at a loss to understand why their\nenthusiasm for all things digital is not shared by\nothers as they proclaim their millenarian\nvisions. On the one hand, technophiles tend to\ndismiss sceptics as Luddites and dinosaurs,\nwhile those of a more moderate disposition\nsimply assume that training is the panacea for\nthose poor myopic souls whose narrow\nconceptual horizons condemn them to a\nsequestered life in the technological void. Both\nsides, paradoxically, usually view the\ndigitization of the world as inevitable. The only\nquestion is how long the resistance can be\nmaintained.\nThis book is a brave attempt to operationalize a\nview of the future. How well does it do it?\nUnfortunately, not well. Even though its scope\nis specific, comparisons with Negroponte's\nBeing Digital, and even Bill Gates's view of The\nRoad Ahead, are inevitable. Both those books\nwere written by people with a serious vision\n(which we may or may not share), but, by way\nof contrast, Higher Education 1998 is less a\nvision of what life will be like on the campus\ntwo years from the millennium than a series of\nmechanistic extrapolations. In other words, it\nhas been assumed by the contributors (and\ncertainly the editors) that we will be doing much\nas we do now, only more rapidly and with better\ntechnology: more work at home, sandwich-style\nstudy, extensive use of email, and a centralized\nnetwork providing communications and\nlearning resources. The change conceived is,\nfrom both an academic and organizational\nperspective, incremental rather than qualitative.\nThe event from which this book derives was the\nfirst (and perhaps last) international CTI\njamboree. The Computers in Teaching Initiative\nhad been set up in the UK in 1985 by the then\nuniversities' Computer Board, to promote the\nuse of computers in university teaching. The\nfirst of two phases centred on the funding of 139\nsoftware development projects, many of. which\n75\nReviews\nquickly sank without trace. In the second phase,\nit was recognized that software did not\nimplement itself, so human beings were funded\nto operate in academic disciplines through a\ndissemination network of (currently 24) CTI\nsubject-based centres, most of which were\nestablished in 1989 and which remain in place.\nSince they began, all CTI centres have published\njournals and newsletters, undertaken reviews of\ncourseware, provided an advice service, visited\ndepartments within their disciplinary\nconstituency, and organized workshops and\nconferences.\nThere have been two attempts to establish the\nCTI model beyond the UK: in Eire and Sweden.\nOf the former we know little. Prospective\nfounder members of the Swedish CTI attended\nthe UK CTI 1992 Spring forum in Stirling; and\nin the following year a joint conference was held\nin Lund for members of the UK CTI and\ncolleagues from Sweden keen to establish a\nsimilar organization in their country. The theme\nof the conference was a futuristic one: 'Higher\nEducation 1998 Transformed by Learning\nTechnology'. A scenario was set out, and the\nquestion asked: 'How did we get from there\n(1993) to here (1998)?'. The conference took the\nform of formal papers by invited speakers, case\nstudies, and participant-work in small groups\nlooking at various problems. The fruits of all\nare represented in the proceedings published\nhere. The task for the conference delegates was\nto undertake a retrospective look 'back' over\nfive years and to analyse the processes that\nmarked the changes posited to be in place. At\nthe time of publication of this review, we are\nnow more than halfway 'there'. So with the\nbenefit of partial hindsight it is possible to begin\nto assess how accurate were the original vision\nand the integrated analysis.\nLearning technology is not just perceived by its\nproponents as being an application in search of\na solution. It has much loftier ambitions:\nnothing less than cultural change. Inherent in\nthis assumption is the view that because the\nadoption of information technology has already\nbrought about a considerable degree of change\nin society generally, linking together higher\neducation and computers generates an\ninexorable facility for widespread change in\nuniversities. Unfortunately, IT zealots seem\nremarkably naive as to just how much de facto\nopposition there is to the use of computers\nwithin teaching contexts in higher education.\nGranted, there is little likelihood of midnight\nraids by modern-day torch-bearing Luddites\nbent on physical destruction of computers, but\nthat probably has more to do with the fact that\nmost of them do not know where the bulk of\ncomputers are kept. Most of the 'opposition'\nseem quite content to do nothing; given that\nonly a small (though growing) section of the\nlecturing community has come around to the\nidea of using IT in teaching. This suggests that\nthe status quo says more about those doing the\npromoting than those being addressed. Many\nlecturers teach IT, rather fewer teach with it.\nI was disappointed to find the book\nunconvincing, lacking in sedulous argument,\nconceptually disjointed, badly written in some\nparts and simply execrable in others. This is not\nto impugn the editors for the variable quality of\nthe writing, although the imperious constraints\nof a publishing deadline no doubt occasioned\nhasty editing in some sections of the work. The\nchapters hang very loosely together all too\ntypically in edited works these days. The worst\nexample is of the final case study on interactive\nvisual electromagnetics, leading straight into the\nsection reporting on the outcome of small-\ngroup discussions, without any signposting for\nthe reader to prepare him or her for what is to\ncome, as shown by the first sentence of the next\nchapter: \"There was a consensus in the group\nthat. . . ' . Anyone who missed the second paper,\nwhich set the stage, would be totally confused.\nEven those who do not use hypermedia do not\nnecessarily start at Chapter 1 and read books in\nan invariable linear sequence.\nIf the key to rooting the future in the present is\ndependent on international co-operation, all\nwill come to naught. Both the Irish and Swedish\nCTIs have failed to take off. A recent survey\nshowed that, except in one CTI centre, no active\nco-operation now exists beyond the exchange of\njournals. The UK CTI centres have some sense\nof history, and many of their papers do provide\nan introspective temporal perspective on\ndevelopments. Unfortunately, many of the\nSwedish papers are simply descriptive snapshots\nof the 'look what we are doing' variety. More\nimportantly, the book fails to take into account\nthe two insuperable obstacles to change: the\ncombined lack of funds, and the erroneous\nassumption endemic in both the Swedish and\nUS contingents that once the technology is in\nplace, everyone and his dog will flock to make\nuse of it. This is a myth, and many of us who\nwere there were rather surprised to learn that\nmany (but not quite all) of the Swedes could not\n76\nVolume 4 Number 2\nbelieve that there was a widespread degree of\nresistance in higher education. Neither could\nthey grasp something we knew only too well in\nthe UK: the absence of a common will to\nimplement the necessary structural and\norganizational changes in institutions and\ncurricula. Conservatism in academia is so\npervasive as to be ubiquitous, even inherent,\nand the lack of reward to overcome inertia is a\nvital catalyst; without it, the vision of the future\npromoted here remains in the future.\nAnother missed element is the axiom that those\nwho neglect to learn the lessons of history are\ncondemned to repeat them. Very few of the\nparticipants here had any sense of past\ndevelopment, something being mirrored in\nmany TLTP projects. It is almost as if new\ngroups arrive on the scene every two years or so,\ntotally ignorant of what has transpired to date.\nBeware the IT enthusiast: his\/her evangelical\nfervour automatically seems to block out the\npast, almost as if the past never existed - only a\nfuture to which they strive. Technological\nupgrades seem to make more than equipment\nobsolete: there also seems to be a concomitant\nvaporization of modes of use.\nThe major flaw is made explicit in the\nintroduction to the final paper: 'Funding and\ntechnical obstacles were not allowed to affect\nthe group's discussions, so the picture that\nemerged [. . .] was the perfect scenario for the\nstudent in 1998 - sufficient finance was\navailable and all technical problems were\nresolvable'. Worse is to follow: '[. . .] it is\nimportant that there is a sound IT strategy led\nby computer services within all institutions.'\nAnd we are not done yet: \"The university's\nadministration will also make use of IT for it\nwill help overcome scheduling difficulties\ncreated by the increase in student numbers.'\nWith flawed thinking like that, no wonder\nnothing substantial emerged.\nThe future remains open.

And if you are\nparticularly interested in promotion, marketing\nor other related value-added services, you\nprobably need go no further than this book.\nThere are 14 chapters. They cover a very good\ngeneral introduction to the Internet, and then\nfocus on the Web. The author looks at graphics,\nfeedback, interactivity, value-added marketing,\ngaining attention, measuring success, starting\npoints and, finally, adds a very interesting\nchapter which looks towards the future and\ndiscusses where the Web might be in a year or\ntwo.\nThe author claims that the book is written by a\nmarketer for marketers. I am sure that is true,\nbut there is also a lot of useful information that\na non-marketer will get from it, and it will be a\nvery good index against which to judge\nmarketers' advice. Anyone who has a Web site\nwhich is essentially providing information will\nhave plenty of indices against which to judge\nthat site. And the book will provide a good way\nof seeing through marketers' recommendations\nand establishing your own objectives (as well as\nof borrowing ideas).\nSterne puts some very interesting information in\nhis appendices. He gives a run-down on a range\nof discussion groups all to do with marketing,\nincluding academic marketing. He then lists a\nwhole range of marketing-oriented Web sites\nthat he recommends, and finishes the book with\na useful index which takes you through most of\nthe sites he has mentioned, the companies, the\nconcepts and so forth.\nEven though the Web is doubling in size every\n53 days and is changing radically as it grows,\nthis book is still up to date, and has a large\namount of valuable data. All the way through\nwe get the distinct impression that Sterne knows\nwhat he is talking about. His style is\nstraightforward and, what is more, every page is\ndisplayed from Netscape Navigator on a\nMacintosh (the fact that the book, so very much\nfocusing on business, uses a Macintosh as the\ndelivery engine, appealed to me!).\nIf I have a criticism, it is that in describing pages\nwhich are displayed, Sterne sometimes states the\nobvious, and there is the occasional over-use of\n77\nReviews\nexclamation marks. But on the whole, this is a\nwell-written and attractive book, and oversized\nto allow for the large use of graphics. Indeed, if\nyou do not want to listen to Sterne's own\naccount, just by looking in detail at the\nillustrations, you can get a fairly clear idea of\nthe range of uses of the Web, and some of the\nclever ideas which have been picked up by a\nrange of large and small companies.\nI suppose I can sum up the book by quoting the\nfinal paragraph: 'So go surf the Web. Assemble\na team. Read some books. Get some tools.\nWrite a style guide. Get started. Get started\nsoon. It will be much harder to catch up later'.\nThe book is a good and fast read.\nNigel Paine, Chief Executive, Scottish Council\nfor Educational Technology\nFred T. Hofstetter, Multimedia Literacy, New\nYork, McGraw-Hill, 1995. ISBN: 0-07-911956-\n5.360 pages, paperback, plus CD-ROM, \u00a320.42.\nThis book is published as an A4-size (American)\nedition with an accompanying CD-ROM. The\ndisc is intended for use on MPC (Multimedia\nPersonal Computer)-compliant systems. The 40\nchapters that make up the book are organized\ninto seven basic parts. Of these, the first four\n(chapters 1 to 17) are devoted to understanding\nmultimedia, a survey of its applications,\nselecting suitable hardware, and looking at\nimminent and long-term future developments.\nThe remaining three parts (comprising chapters\n18 to 40) each present a hands-on tutorial using\nthe various software resources presented on the\nCD-ROM. These tutorials cover multimedia\ntools and techniques, developing a simple\nmultimedia application, and creating advanced'\nmultimedia packages. The chapters begin with a\nstatement of objectives which specify what\nreaders should be able to achieve on completion\nof their associated study units. Apart from those\nin Part 6, every chapter includes a set of\nexercises which provide various opportunities\nfor involvement in hands-on activities using the\nCD-ROM.\nThe 'theory' section of the book (Parts 1 to 4)\nincludes introductory chapters that deal with the\nvarious MPC specifications, a multimedia object\ntaxonomy, and descriptions of various\napplication areas such as education, entertain-\nment, business and industry, government and\nmedicine. The sections that deal with corporate\ntraining, just-in-time training, medical training\nand education are particularly interesting, and\nrelevant to those involved in the pedagogic\naspects of computer use. Subsequent chapters in\nthis section deal with a variety of different topics\nincluding application development packages\n(PowerPoint, Harvard Graphics, ToolBook,\nPODIUM - see below -, Authorware\nProfessional and Quest), competing multimedia\nstandards ('multi-multimedia'), multimedia PC\ncomponents, checklists for buying a multimedia\ncomputer, and how to configure MPC systems.\nSome thought is also given to possible future\ndevelopments in these areas and the legal issues\nthat multimedia technologies create. The book\ntherefore considers recent developments in\nelectronic publishing, the impact of the informa-\ntion superhighway, virtual reality and emerging\ntechnologies. Various societal issues associated\nwith multimedia (and the Internet) are also\ndiscussed. Throughout the theory part of the\nbook, the author makes frequent references to\ndemonstration material contained on the CD-\nROM. Thus, after reading about a topic, system\nor package, you can follow up these references\nand use demonstration versions of the software\ndiscussed in the text.\nThe hands-on section of the book is based on the\nuse of a multimedia authoring tool called\nPODIUM. This tool is available for purchase\nfrom the University of Delaware, but a cut-\ndown version of the system is supplied on the\nCD-ROM for use with the tutorials. The first\neight of these tutorials (chapters 18 to 25, which\nmake up Part 5 of the book) deal with the use of\nscreen-based text, simple graphics (based on\nbitmap images), triggering events, waveform\naudio, CD audio clip-making, MIDI sequenc-\ning, digital video recording, and videodisc\nclip-making. For those who are new to\nmultimedia techniques, the practical activities\nembedded in these chapters would serve as a\nuseful means of developing the necessary\nbackground skills. In Part 6 (chapters 26\nthrough 30), the tutorials lead readers in a step-\nby-step fashion through the development of a\nsimple multimedia application that deals with\nthe history of flight. The essential steps involve\ncreating a pictorial menu (using images of\naeroplanes taken from the CD-ROM), and\nlinking these to related multimedia information\n(again taken from the CD-ROM). The ten\nchapters that make up the final part of the book\nare used to illustrate the stages involved in\ncreating a more advanced multimedia applica-\ntion. The case study that is chosen deals with the\n78\nALT-] Volume 4 Number 2\nuse of various information-superhighway\nservices such as ftp, telnet, gophers and news\nfeeders. Within this section, readers are taken\nthrough the steps involved in creating the basic\npackage using PODIUM. A bill-board\nmetaphor is used as the basis for the end-user\ninterface; this is also used for linking in the\nvarious Internet resources that are called upon.\nI found this book exciting and easy to read (it\ncontains a multitude of useful illustrations, all\nof which are in colour and of an extremely high\nquality). The book is very readable for two\nreasons: first, because it does not delve too\ndeeply into the highly technical detail of\nmultimedia; and second, because it gives\ncomprehensive explanations of all the steps\ninvolved in undertaking multimedia\ndevelopment tasks. Because it uses a friendly\nhands-on environment for teaching, this book\nwould undoubtedly make a useful starting point\nfor those who are computer literate and want to\nfind out more about creating and publishing\nmultimedia learning resources.\nAlthough the book can be read independently\nof its CD-ROM, the latter certainly adds value\nto the learning experience. The polymedia\napproach to publishing (paper and CD-ROM)\ntaken here is, not surprisingly, becoming an\nincreasingly popular way of providing active\nlearning experiences.\nPhilip Barker, University ofTeesside\nJ. Brown, R. Earnshaw, M. Jem and J. Vince,\nVisualization - Using Computer Graphics to\nExplore and Present Information, New York,\nWiley, 1995. ISBN: 0-471-12991-7. 287 pages,\npaperback, plus CD-ROM, \u00a335.00.\nTo paraphrase the authors' own words: the\npublication is a non-technical guide which\nprovides a brief background on the field of\nvisualization - the use of computer graphics to\nexplore and present information. It is intended\nfor IT professionals who need to evaluate or\nimplement a computer-graphics or visualization\nfacility.\nThe nine chapters lead the reader from an\nintroduction to the concepts of visualization,\nthrough the commercial possibilities of its use,\nthe range of currently available hardware and\nsoftware and a number of case studies, to a\ncautious vision of likely developments in the\nnear future. Throughout, there are screen-shots\nof visualization applications in use and\nreferences to specific software producers and\ntheir products.\nChapter 1 gives a brief and rather spasmodic\nhistory of the ideas behind visualization,\nstarting with mankind's first use of maps and\nmentioning the discovery of X-rays on its way\nto bringing in computer graphics and virtual\nreality.\nChapter 2 discusses the global markets for\nvisualization applications in Computer Aided\nDesign, Geographical Information Systems and\nVisual Data Analysis. Estimates of the current\nsize of the markets and their likely growth are\ngiven as quotes from various commercial\nsources. The chapter continues with a brief\ndiscussion of the issues to be addressed by a\ncompany entering the field. Comparisons are\nmade between custom and off-the-shelf\nsoftware, in-1iouse development and out-\nsourcing, and the adoption of ISO versus de\nfacto standards.\nThe third chapter covers the range of\npossibilities of computer-generated images and\nthe ways they can be produced. Methods of\ncreating visualizations from subroutine and\nobject libraries, from fourth-generation lan-\nguages and from visual programming tools are\ncatalogued. The whole range of visualization\noutput is covered, from 2-D charts and graphs\nto animated, rendered, 3-D models. Important\nconcepts are introduced - viewports, inter-\npolation, contours, iso-surfaces, vector field\nvisualization and geometric modelling, but, in\ncommon with the rest of the book, the\ndescriptions are superficial, concentrating on\nbreadth of coverage rather than detailed\nexplanation.\nIn chapters four and seven, the concepts\nintroduced are revisited in terms of particular\napplication fields. Software requirements for\nComputer Aided Design, Finite Element\nAnalysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics,\nGeographical Information Systems and\nMathematical Visualization are analysed in\nChapter 4, and suitable visualization products\nfor these fields are listed. There is also a\ndiscussion of typical hardware platforms from\nPCs to supercomputers, and of image-related\noutput peripherals. Chapter 4 concludes with a\nBuyer's Guide, a table showing the features of a\nnumber of current visualization and graphics\nproducts (for those interested, a more\ncomprehensive list is given in the November\n1995 edition of IEEE Spectrum). Over 20 short\n79\nReviews\nvisualization case studies are described in\nChapter 7. The rationale for using visualization\ntechniques is given in each case, and sometimes\nthe software and hardware used is mentioned,\nbut there is no other technical detail.\nThe other two chapters in the book contain an\nuncharacteristically detailed section on the use\nof colour and a history of GUIs, with some\nexplanation of the structure of X-Windows and\nMotif, and a description of the Internet.\nThe accompanying CD-ROM contains digitized\ncopies of all the images in the text, some of the\ntables, and 16 QuickTime movies showing\nvisualization in action. None of these are\nexplicitly referred to in the text, but they are\norganized into directories which match the\nchapters of the book. The CD is dual-format,\nreadable by PCs and by Apple Macintoshes.\nThere are two viewers included: Adobe Acrobat\n(although the Buyer's Guide is the only\ndocument in this format), and Apple Quick-\nTime for viewing the digitized videoclips. The\nimages and figures from the book are stored in\nTIFF format, and no viewer is provided for\nthem. TIFF viewers are readily available, and\nare built into some word processors, but it does\nseem rather inconsiderate not to provide a way\nof looking at the bulk of the content of the CD\n(had the images been stored in JPEG format,\nthey could have been seen with the supplied\nQuickTime viewer).The images and movies are\ndrawn from commercial visualization examples.\nThe movies, many with sound, are mostly\npublicity or demonstration material produced\nby large corporations, and show very slick\nexamples of high-quality computer graphics. It\nis questionable whether digitized video is the\nbest medium to use for these examples, but I\nsuspect that the novelty value of a book with an\naccompanying CD-ROM is still enough to\noverride such practical considerations.\nNevertheless, distributing a video tape with the\nbook would be a better way to experience the\nhigh quality of state-of-the-art visualization.\nThe quality would be much better, and the\nexamples could more easily be shown to a large\naudience. Of course, there are reasons for using\nCD instead; they are cheaper to produce than\nvideo tapes, more compact, and only one\nversion is needed to cover the main formats. I\nfelt, though, that the authors have not made the\nbest use of the possibilities of the CD-ROM\nmedium. They could have included demonstra-\ntion versions of visualization software, some of\nwhich the manufacturers are falling over\nthemselves to give away, or simple simulations\nto illustrate some of the concepts introduced:\nvisual programming, choice of colour in\nvisualization design, and 'walking through'\ndata, for example. They have missed the\nopportunity to convey the sensation of\ninteracting directly with data, which is surely\nthe biggest selling point for visualization tools.\nAs for possible use of the book in education, it\nis too light on detail to be used as a\nvisualization or computer-graphics textbook. It\nmay have a place, however, as a primer for\nstudents who are about to embark on\nvisualization or multimedia projects. The\npublication's broad taxonomy of applications\nand the state-of-the-art examples it provides\nmay inspire them to explore more widely the\npossibilities of the field.\nRichard Storer, University of Paisley\nAndrew Bradbury, Successful Presentation Skills,\nLondon, Kogan Page, 1995. ISBN: 0-7494-1749-\n8.107 pages, paperback, \u00a36.99.\nThis book is a new addition to the well-known\nKogan Page series of guides for business\nmanagers, 'Better Management Skills'. Like all\nbooks in the series, the intention is to provide a\npractical but comprehensive coverage of the\narea in a readily accessible and easily read form.\nSince effective presentation, the topic of this\nparticular book, is informed by a wide range of\nquite complex material, including studies of\ncommunication theory, learning styles, body\nlanguage, visualization, and memory, the\nauthor has had a particular challenge. Readers\nneed to be able to understand enough of the\ntheoretical ideas that justify the suggestions,\nand to see these in an integrated framework to\ngain confidence for implementation. Hence,\nwithin a text of just over 100 pages, there are 14\nvery short chapters, each one covering a range\nof different ideas leading to practical\nsuggestions. The book begins with two basic\nmessages: that everyone in business should\nrealize the importance of presentation for\nsuccess, and that everyone can learn how to\nmake a successful presentation. In the following\nchapters, the author suggests how this may be\nachieved.\n'How we communicate' includes a repeat of the\nmessage that needs to be repeated so many\ntimes - the importance of non-verbal signals\n80\nALT-J Volume 4 Number 2\n(93%) to verbal content (7%) in presentations.\nSystematic ways of building up confidence are\noutlined in the next two chapters. Later\nchapters deal with objectives, structure and\norganization. The critical thing to identify is the\nobjective. Once this is clarified, the appropriate\nstructure and organization can be decided. The\nchapter on knowing your audience stresses the\nimportance of putting the customer first. Here,\nthe treatment of learning styles may be cursory,\nbut is sufficient to stress the need to consider\nthem in both the preparation of material and\nhow questions are to be handled.\nThere are two chapters on fitting the words to\nthe presentation frame. The first deals with how\nmany points you can hope to cover within given\ntime-slots, and offers advice on how to adapt\nmaterials. The second emphasizes the\nimportance of the conclusion. Presenters often\npay a great deal of attention to their\nintroduction, but neglect the need to provide a\ngood ending.\nA following chapter deals with the critical first\n60 seconds of a presentation. A joke? A\nquestion? An anecdote? What helps? What does\nnot help? This topic provides a useful way into\nthe two chapters that deal with visual aids. The\nfirst of these reviews the advantages and\ndisadvantages of chalkboards, whiteboards,\nflipcharts, overhead-projector transparencies,\nslides, computer-based displays, video and film.\nThis is followed by a brief treatment on\ndesigning effective visual aids.\nA welcome chapter on the setting up of display\nfacilities provides a reminder to the presenter\nnot to forget to consider the arrangements for\nthe audience as well. As in all the chapters, there\nare useful tips: for example on how to deal with\nsituations where you have a large number of\nseats and only a small audience, and when and\nwhere to have refreshments served.\nWhy, when and how to deal with questioners\nand hecklers is the subject of the next chapter.\nThis topic not always covered in texts on\npresentational skills, yet it can be one of the\naspects of a presentation about which the novice\npresenter is most nervous.\nThe final chapter looks at personal\npresentation, and once again the message is the\nimportance of paying attention to how you say\nwhat you want to say as well as what you want\nto say.\nThe whole text is written in a very lively manner\nwith ample use of boxes, bullet points, review\nquestions, lists of key ideas, tips and\nmnemonics. I particularly liked PANIC, when\ncalled on to make an unexpected presentation.\nPANIC unpacks most helpfully as Purpose,\nAudience, Need, Information, Communication.\nSometimes, however, the reader may feel the\nneed of a further glossary. The instruction to\n'indicate whether batteries are included'\ntranslates into letting your audience know what\ntheir follow-up action or success criterion will\nbe. Such examples illustrate how the book is\nintended for a business readership. This point\ndoes raise some minor concerns. First, such a\nreadership may readily accept the 'sound byte'\napproach, but not all readers will. Snappy\nheadings are used over-abundantly not only for\nchapter headings but for sections within\nchapters, and for some readers, such a\ntreatment may jar. Secondly, some academic\nreaders may wince at the summary treatment of\ntheir particular area of academic interest. There\nis a brief basic bibliography appended.\nBut the skills of effective communication are\ncommon to business and academic\npresentations. This book contains many helpful\npractical suggestions on presentation which are\nrelevant to readers who present research papers,\nlead seminars, give lectures and run workshops.\nAnd it must be admitted that although there is\ncurrently a lot of emphasis on communication\nskills in the academic field, the presentation of\nthe subject matter, if addressed at all in the\nstandard course texts, tends to concentrate on\nwritten reports. This book can help to fill the\ngap.\nDianne Phillips, Manchester Metropolitan\nUniversity\nJ. Ceserani and P. Greatwood, Innovation and\nCreativity, London, Kogan Page, 1995. ISBN: 0-\n7494-1593-2.192 pages, paperback, \u00a312.95.\nThis is one of the Kogan Page 'Fast-track\nMBA* series which aims to present core subjects\nfrom a typical MBA syllabus in a lively and\naccessible way. The claim is that the series\nprovides texts that have a 'practical, action-\noriented style which involves the reader in\nself-assessment and participation'. The intended\nreadership is managers wanting either to refresh\nor further to develop their capabilities, or those\nactually undertaking study for an MBA - who\nshould find that the series provides a solid\ngrounding in the subjects to be covered. At the\n81\nReviews\noutset, the book states that it is 'not a book',\nbut rather a prompt to a journey of exploration.\nIndeed, the reader is encouraged to read the\nmain sections in any order.\nPart 1 introduces the 'toolkit'. Some analysis of\nthe importance and extent of innovation in\nbusiness is reported. For example, some 80% of\nUS companies say that innovation is very\nimportant to their business (though no evidence\nis offered of the situation in other countries).\nOnly 4% of these companies say that they are\ngood at innovation. Sales, profits, and market\nshare were all found to be improved in\ninnovative companies. The advice which follows\nis an attempt to encourage forms of thinking\nwhich may lead to innovation. It often does this\nby phrases such as 'you are creative'; 'you are\nan innovator'; 'take this thought into yourself.\nAlbert Einstein is quoted several times. There\nare also many short examples of ways in which\nnew thinking has led to product innovation.\nThere are maps and diagrams, some of which\nare superfluous. There is helpful advice on how\nto run meetings in order that unconventional or\neven silly suggestions can be considered with-\nout participants feeling uncomfortable or\nthreatened. A structure for creative problem-\nsolving is then proposed.\nPart 2 purports to demonstrate a map of the\nterritory of innovation. However, it differs from\nPart 1 only in some details. One of these lies in\nconsidering the participants in a meeting as a\ncast of Jungian characters, though it is doubtful\nwhether the descriptions accurately mirror\nJung's theory of psychological types. The level\nof subtlety introduced clouds any practical\nbenefits: I tried viewing a (real) problem from\nseveral of these angles and found the\ndistinctions impossible to apply.\nPart 3 is entitled 'The Author is You', which\nmeans that after being told that creativity is like\nsex, there follows 30 pages of simple questions\nwith blank boxes for the answers.\nIn attempting to teach creative thinking, this\nbook has several flaws. It is a slim volume with\nmany pages that convey very little information.\nFor those who require structure, it does not\noffer a coherent and systematic methodology;\nindeed it confuses by a plethora of simplistic\nexamples backed up by gimmicky phrases.\nMany are entertaining, some are useful, but\ntaken as a whole there is little of substance. It is\nnot 'not a book'. It is simply a book which is\nnot academic: it appears to be written for\npeople in a hurry, and who are not prepared to\nconcentrate on gaining a deeper understanding\nof the subject. It has surface but no depth.\nPerhaps people studying for an MBA are like\nthat, but I doubt it. The authors have a\nbackground in training business personnel using\nthese techniques. Perhaps this is the book's\nmain deficit: in direct face-to-face training,\ntrainees may be led to gain an understanding -\nthrough several differing exercises - of a more\nideational and playful form of thinking which\nmay lead to innovation. In the hands of a skilled\ntrainer, these disparate threads can be pulled\ntogether. In this book the threads are left\nhanging. It is strange that though the text often\nuses examples based on manufacturing industry,\nit neglects the use of those who are skilled (and\ntalented) in creative thinking, for example\nindustrial designers. Now that really would be\ninnovative.\nDavid Darling, Edge Ltd. Hartlepool\nJulie Cotton, The Theory of Assessment: an\nIntroduction, London, Kogan Page, 1995. ISBN:\n0-7494-1709-9.160 pages, paperback, \u00a314-95.\nTowards the end of this book, the author Julie\nCotton advises assessors to be 'positive first';\nand like much of the practical advice contained\nin The Theory of Assessment, I propose to take\nit. The book provides much valuable practical\nadvice on how to construct effective and\nsuitable modes of assessment; but as a\ndiscussion of the theory of assessment, it is\nfrankly disappointing. To some degree this\ncriticism arises directly from one of the book's\ngreatest strengths. The author describes the\nbook as 'an introductory book with suggestions\nfor activities to help you apply the theory to\nyour work'; and this is exactly what it is. The\ndifficulty, if it is one, is that it is stronger on\napplication than theory.\nFor example, in the introduction the author\nwrites: 'Assessment is not a bolt-on extra to\nteaching and training but an integral part of the\nplanning, preparation and delivery. Indeed,\ngood assessment is a consolidating tool within\nthe learning process'. One can only concur; but\nthis remains an assertion rather than a\ndeveloped theoretical position. Nonetheless, it is\none of the fundamental assumptions of the\nbook, and much of what is valuable in the book\narises from it.\nThe book is divided into 10 chapters each of\nwhich covers some issue or issues that arise\n82\nAn-J Volume 4 Number 2\nfrom considering the role of assessment in\neducation and training. Each chapter carefully\nsets out several 'concepts', the development of\nwhich is punctuated by short sections that invite\nreaders to 'stop and reflect', or by some\n'activity' designed to make readers evaluate\ntheir own practice as assessors. Thus at one\npoint in Chapter 2, 'Traditional Methods', the\nreader is asked to reflect on the question: 'Do\nyou think that regular assessment encouraged\nor discouraged your progress during formal\nstudy?'; and later to perform the following\nactivity: \"The next time you set an \"end\" test\npaper, write it in the form of a structured paper\nwith a clear marking scheme and write a student\nfeedback form. Check to make sure that the\nlearners get better feedback from this\nexperiment.' Pursuing these strategies as a\nreader may not exactly lead one to theorize\none's modes of assessment, but it can certainly\nprovide a fruitful way of reflecting upon them.\nChapters 1 to 6 consider a range of testing\nstrategies and methodologies, including various\nforms of objective, standardized, and\npsychometric tests. In general, the discussions\nare most fruitful when dealing with modes of\nassessment that do not invite open-ended\nanswers. There is comparatively little\nconsideration given to the theoretical or indeed\npractical issues that arise in assessing, for\nexample, open-ended essay-type questions. Of\ncourse, much of the general discussion of such\nissues as 'Reliability and Validity' (Chapter 6)\napplies equally to open-ended examination\nsituations and more closed objective testing.\nFurthermore, since many readers of ALT-J are\nlikely to be involved in some form of computer-\naided learning where open-ended assessment is\nnotoriously difficult anyway, this concentration\non more closed forms of examination and\ntesting is by no means a serious fault. For\nexample, Chapter 5, 'Statistics and Records',\nprovides an eminently readable and helpful\nintroduction to the intelligent use of statistical\nanalysis within an assessment situation.\nCertainly, there is much there that could be used\nby CAL\/CBT developers to help them devise\nintelligible modes of representing data gathered\nabout student performance in computer-based\nlearning environments. Similarly, much of\nCotton's practical advice about how to devise\nvarious forms of tests applies equally to\ncomputer-based and paper-based modes of\nassessment. However, given the current interest\nin computer-based assessment, viz. the recent\nedition of Active Learning devoted to the\nsubject, it is somewhat disappointing that\nCotton only gives it a single page of\nconsideration.\nThe book has a strong bias towards\n'competency-based learning'. The subject is\nintroduced in Chapter 3, and much of what\nfollows seems to accept that this is the most\nappropriate form of assessment. Again one is\ninclined to concur, but the arguments in favour\nmight have been more strongly developed. For\nexample, in Chapters 7 and 8 which deal with\nexternal and internal verification respectively,\nthe author accepts the NVQ approach as an\nexample of good practice. At the very least, this\nis a contentious claim, but it is not debated as\nsuch. No doubt this is partly because of the\nauthor's considerable expertise in the field of\nNVQs, but it also appears to be partly a\nfunction of her acceptance of the competence-\nbased model. Nonetheless, for those readers\ninvolved in developing or teaching within the\nNVQ framework, these two chapters should\nprove invaluable. Indeed, for anyone interested\nin NVQ, the whole book is a valuable\nintroduction.\nThe final two chapters, 'Trends in Assessment'\nand 'Self-evaluation and Appraisal' are the least\ninteresting in the book, and seem, after the\ndetailed analysis of NVQ, to come as something\nof an afterthought. Even the proposed 'activity'\nwith which the book closes falls somewhat flat\neven though one could not argue with the\nappositeness of ending this book with the\nwords: 'Write your own appraisal form as self-\nevaluation. What better to finish this book than\nto fill in this form for yourself to start your own\nsystem of self-evaluation!'\nOne final criticism that is in no way the\nresponsibility of the author. The book did not\nsurvive the process of review. When I was just .\nover half way through, pages began to fall out.\nThis is not what one expects from a publisher as\nrespectable as Kogan Page or from a book\npriced at \u00a314.95.\nBruce Douglas Ingraham, University ofTeesside\n83\n"}
