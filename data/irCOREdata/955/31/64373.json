Introduction \n \nThe Barents Sea plays an important role in the climate system of the Arctic (Schauer et al., \n1997; Maslowski et al. 2004, for example). About half of the heat loss to the atmosphere in \n2 \nthe entire Nordic Seas takes place here (Simonsen & Haugan, 1996), and the water masses in \nthe Barents Sea are therefore strongly modified by cooling, ice formation and brine release, \n(Midttun, 1985). When the modified water leaves the Barents Sea in the east, its increased \ndensity causes it to enter the Arctic Ocean as an intermediate water mass and influence the \ndeep circulation within the Arctic basins. Gerdes et al. (2003) have demonstrated that the ice \nextent exerts a strong control on the water mass transformation taking place in the Barents \nSea. Sea ice extent data have been available for the Barents Sea over the last few decades \nfrom remote sensing, see for example Kvingedal and Sorteberg (2005). Very little data, \nhowever, are available on sea ice thickness, although indirect measurements have recently \nbegun to emerge from satellite altimetry observations (Laxon et al., 2003).  \nHere we present two years of ice draft observations obtained from a mooring at 77\u00b0 \n55'N 28\u00b0 20'E equipped with upward looking sonar (ULS). The time series is accompanied by \n3 years of current meter data from the same position. The mooring location is indicated on the \nmap in figure 1. To the authors\u2019 knowledge this is the only multi-seasonal time series of ice \nthickness in the Barents Sea. Such data sets are essential for calibrating remotely sensed data, \nand will serve to help validate numerical models (Budgell, 2005, for example). \nIn section 2 we present the instruments used, and describe the data processing \nmethods. Section 3 contains the results of the ULS measurements, as well as the current, \ntemperature and salinity observations. We discuss these observations in section 4, and relate \nthem to advection of water masses and atmospheric forcing. Some conclusions are given in \nsection 5. \n \n2. Instruments and methods \n \n2.1 ULS data \n3 \n \nA ULS was deployed in 1993-1994, but unfortunately it did not work; there are no data from \nthis year. A Christian Michelsen Research (CMR) ES-300-IV ULS (Strass, 1998) was \ndeployed in 1994, and replaced in 1995 with an APL (Applied Physics Lab, University of \nWashington) ULS Mark-2 (Drucker et al., 2003). The instruments sampled the ice draft at \nintervals of 4 and 5 minutes, respectively. \n \n2.1.1 Data processing \n \nThe initial data consist of sonar return times and pressures. The pressures are corrected for \nvarying sea level pressure using quarter-daily sea-level pressure data for 77.5\u00b0N 27.5\u00b0E \ndownloaded from the website of the NCAR\/NCEP reanalysis project at the NOAA-CIRES \nClimate Diagnostics Center (NCEP 2003). The average density and speed of sound in the \nwater column above the ULS were calculated using temperatures measured in the ULS and in \nthe current meter, along with climatological salinities (from Steele et al., 2001), enabling the \npressure and return time to be converted to instrument depth and range, respectively. The \ntarget range is then subtracted from the instrument depth to obtain the initial ice draft (or \nwater level) estimate. These estimates were then processed using a method involving satellite-\nderived ice concentrations to correct the zero level of the data, and to classify the data into \nopen water and ice; this process is more fully described by Abrahamsen (2003), and is \nsummarized below. \nOur source for ice concentration data was the Defense Meteorological Satellite \nProgram (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM\/I) (Cavalieri et al. 1990). \nAvailable for both hemispheres with 25-km resolution, these data have previously been \ncompared with ULS-derived measurements (Harms et al., 2001, for example). We note that in \n4 \nfigure 8 of that paper, the satellite data appear to yield higher estimates of the ice \nconcentration than the ULS. We experienced the opposite effect, with the satellite data giving \nslightly lower estimates of the ice concentration. A reason may be that if both ice and water \nare present in the ULS footprint \u2013 in our case this nominally covers a circle approximately 3-7 \nm in diameter \u2013 the ULS would preferentially measure the ice, especially when the ice \nconcentration is high. We found, empirically, that using the square root as a transfer function \nfor the satellite-derived ice concentrations (thus skewing them towards higher \nconcentrations), yielded better results in the algorithm below, both visually and in terms of the \nbias in the resulting mean ice drafts (as estimated in section 2.1.2). This may not be \nappropriate in other regions, particularly those that experience lower ice concentrations. \nAssuming that a fraction of the ULS measurements that corresponds to the satellite-\nderived ice concentration is for ice-covered conditions, we know that the remaining points \nmust correspond to open water. Our algorithm uses this to classify each data point either as  \nice or as open water, and to correct the zero level of the data. \nWe first go through the satellite-derived ice concentration time series for the pixel \nclosest to the mooring and fill in any missing points by linear interpolation. We then take the \nsquare root of the ice cover (for reasons described above). We now go through the ULS time \nseries in blocks of 10 days. We found that 7\u201310 days works best; with longer blocks, the \ncorrespondence between the percentage of open water points and the satellite-derived ice \ncover will  improve, but the longer averaging times will also smear out the profile, ignoring \nbrief events in atmospheric\/oceanic conditions. Within each block, if the satellite-derived ice \ncover is zero, we set the zero level to the median of the draft estimates, subtract it from them, \nand flag the points as open water. If the mean ice cover is greater than 99%, we set a flag to \nmark the data as uncorrected, and continue to the next block. If the ice cover n is between 0 \nand 99%, we sort the data in the block in order of increasing draft; since the lowest (100-n) \n5 \npercent of our measurements correspond to open water, we set the zero level to the median of \nthe drafts in this range, and flag these points as open water. The use of the median is very \nrobust at determining the zero level, as the mode of the open water distribution should be \ncentered on the mean water level. The rest of the points are flagged as ice, and all points in \nthe block are also marked as uncorrected. We now interpolate the determined zero level to all \npoints previously flagged as uncorrected; the resulting time series is filtered with a 10-day \nlow-pass filter and then subtracted from the drafts. We have now determined the zero level for \nall the data points. The final step is to force the open water points to be distributed evenly \naround this zero level. Therefore we go through the data blocks with ice concentrations above \n0% again, and, in order of increasing drafts, we successively reclassify data points originally \nflagged as ice to open water, such that the mean of the (corrected) open water drafts is as \nclose to zero as possible. \n \n2.1.2. Error estimate \n \nBased on previous validated studies of sea ice drafts using ULS, we estimate that the RMS \nerror of the individual measurements is on the order of 10 cm, while there could be an overall \nbias towards thicker mean ice drafts of up to 12% for 1994-1995 (Kvambekk & Vinje 1992; \nStrass 1998), and probably around 2% for 1995-1996 (Drucker et al. 2003), the difference \nresulting from the slightly different sampling techniques within the different instruments. This \nbias is most likely the dominant error in the ice thickness statistics, and, as we have no ice \nthickness verification data, it cannot be reliably quantified and corrected. \nTo determine errors resulting from, or remaining after the data processing, we went \nthrough the time series and manually indicated the water level for one-week blocks; compared \n6 \nwith this baseline, our data appear to have an overall bias on the order of 3 cm toward thicker \nice, with RMS errors around 6-8 cm. \nThe open water curves in the histograms in figure 2 are approximately Gaussian and \ncentered around zero, as should be expected, at least as a first order approximation, from \nwaves centered around the mean sea level (Podg\u00f3rski et al., 2000). The \u201ctails\u201d of the \nhistograms for ice drafts > 5 m are expected to drop off exponentially (Wadhams 2000); this \nis the case in most months (not shown).  \nMelling (1997a & 1997b) found that errors in the ice draft distributions introduced by \nvariations in ice speed could be corrected by weighting the measurements using concurrent \nADCP-derived ice velocities (the instruments were mounted side by side on the top of the \nmooring). We attempted to weight the histograms using daily SSM\/I-derived ice velocities \n(Fowler 2003), but this does not appear to smooth the histograms; on the contrary, it seemed \nto have the opposite effect. In general, the histograms seem relatively smooth to begin with, \nindicating that our data set does not significantly suffer from these errors; consequently our \nhistograms and statistics have not been weighted using ice velocities. \n \n2.2 Current meter data \n \nAn Aanderaa Instruments RCM 7 current meter was deployed below the ULS for each year\u2019s \ndeployment, and an Aanderaa Instruments WLR 7 pressure recorder was deployed on the \nbottom for the first year only; table 1 lists instrument and deployment depths; the latter are \nalso indicated in figure 3. The current meters and bottom pressure recorder were set to sample \nat an interval of one hour. While the temperature measurements of the Aanderaa instruments \nare reliable, the stability of some of the older conductivity cells is less so. Because of the lack \nof supplemental data, no attempt has been made to calibrate the salinities, and we consider \n7 \nthem to give relative values only. The first year\u2019s salinity observations have been discarded \nbecause of quality concerns. \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1. Hydrographic data \n \nWe have two CTD profiles from the BarKode (Barents and Kara Seas Oceanographic \nDatabase) CD-ROM (Golubev & Zuyev 1999), taken from R\/V Lance on July 22 and August \n8, 1995, at times corresponding to the recovery and redeployment of the mooring. Both are \nplotted in figure 3. \nOn August 8 there was a clear thermocline below the surface layer, which is around 20 \nmeters thick; it was not present on July 22; a slight warming and a clear freshening near the \nsurface occurred after this date. Below this, there seems to be a gradual increase in salinity \ntowards the bottom, where it reaches 34.7. There is a cold core centered at around 50 m, and a \nwarmer water mass at the bottom, extending up to a thermocline at 170 m, where a weaker \nhalocline was also observed. The CTD profiles indicate some variability in the depth of the \nthermocline; it is clear that the current meter was within this transition zone during the first \ntwo years, and further inside the cold water mass during the last year, as is also evident from \nfigure 4a. \n \n3.2. Current meter data \n \n3.2.1. Currents \n \n8 \nThe weekly mean currents from all three years are plotted in figure 5. The predominant \ndirection is clearly towards SSE. The mean speed over all three years was 7.4 cm s-1 with an \naverage current of 1.8 cm s-1 in the direction of 147\u00b0. The current is strongest in October-\nNovember in all years. In April 1996 the mean current weakens, leading to a northward mean \nflow lasting until August. \n \n3.2.2. Tides and bottom pressure \n \nThere is a clear semi-diurnal tidal signal in the current. We can compute the parameters of the \nvarious tidal components from a harmonic decomposition of the currents and bottom \npressures. The six frequencies with the most energy are given in table 2; M2, the principal \nlunar component, clearly dominates, followed by S2, the principal solar component. The M2 \n\u201ccurrent ellipse\u201d is clockwise, as are N2 and K2; the other ellipses are almost uni-directional. \nThe bottom pressure shows approximately the same relative magnitudes of the tidal \ncomponents, with spring tide amplitudes on the order of 0.5 dbar. The low-pass filtered \npressure series mostly shows variations of around 0.1 dbar amplitude from the mean, with \nmaximum anomalies of 0.24 dbar (not shown). \n \n3.2.3. Temperatures and salinities \n \nThe temperature series from the current meters and from the bottom pressure sensor that was \ndeployed for the first year are shown in figure 4. The time series from the bottom pressure \nsensor shows less variation and higher temperatures than the other instruments; all but a few \nmeasurements are above 0\u00b0C. Higher in the water column, the RCM temperatures decrease \nrapidly in late January 1995; there appears to be an oscillation between cold and warm states, \n9 \nwhere the cold state is close to the freezing point. The temperature rises suddenly in mid-\nApril, and makes several jumps between cold and slightly warmer conditions; the mean \ntemperature rises through the end of the time series. The third year's data have a considerably \nlower maximum temperature than the two other series. The temperature rises steadily through \nthe fall, but in early January we see a sharp cooling; once again this appears to be in the form \nof an oscillation. In February and March the temperature remains close to freezing, while the \nsalinity rises slightly, with much less variation than is otherwise seen. There appears to be a \nfairly strong correspondence between the variations in temperature and salinity. \n \n3.2.4. Ice draft \n \nAs a result of the long sampling intervals (4-5 minutes), the measured ice drafts must be \nconsidered as a statistical sample of the ice drafts present at the mooring location, rather than \na profile of the ice topography; individual features on the bottom of the ice are not resolved. \nAlmost all analyses of these data are based on daily or monthly means and distributions of \ndrafts. Thus, we must clarify some of the definitions used in this paper. When referring to the \nmean ice draft, we mean the mean draft including open water; in some of the literature this is \nalso called the \u201ceffective ice draft.\u201d When we refer to means of only the measurements \nflagged as ice, they are called \u201cselective ice drafts.\u201d For the sake of completeness they are \nindicated in figures 2 & 6. Because of the relatively small fraction of open water \nmeasurements outside the summer months, the difference between these values is much \nsmaller than is the case in, for instance, Fram Strait (Kvambekk & Vinje 1992). \nThe time series of daily mean ice drafts (figure 6), shows a very clear difference in \ndraft between our two years of data. 1994-1995 had much thicker ice than 1995-1996 \u2014 the \nFebruary-May mean drafts were 2.61 m and 1.56 m, respectively. Another prominent feature \n10 \nis the occurrence of several brief minima in the spring of 1996. Figure 2 shows the monthly \ndistribution of ice drafts, with a curve for open water superimposed; the mean and selective \nmean ice drafts are also indicated. \n \n4. Discussion \n \n4.1. Currents and hydrography \n \nAccording to the water mass definitions of Pfirman et al. (1994), the cold core seen at around \n30-80 m depth in figure 3 is Arctic Water (AW), a cold water mass formed locally by cooling \nand subsequent convection. The warmer, more saline water below is probably Northern \nBarents Atlantic-Derived Water (NBAW), a branch of the West Spitzbergen Current that has \nfollowed the continental shelf around Svalbard before entering the Barents Sea from the \nnorth. This is consistent with Pfirman et al.\u2019s (1994) description of a warm core of NBAW \nflowing SW through the straits between Kvit\u00f8ya and Franz Josef Land into the Barents Sea, \nwith a temperature maximum around 200 m. The current meter is in the boundary between the \nAW and NBAW layers for the first two years, and is further inside the AW layer during the \nthird year. Both water masses would be expected to flow in the same direction: towards SW; \nthey are topographically steered along the isobaths around the Olga Basin towards SSE, with \na predominant current direction of about 150\u00b0 (figure 1). \nThe steady rise in salinity at near-freezing temperatures between January and May \n1996 is a result of brine rejection from freezing. The oscillations in temperature seen in \nFebruary-March 1995 and January 1996 are probably caused by a front between NBAW and \nAW passing by the mooring location; such a front (the Polar Front) is known to exist between \n11 \nAW and Southern Barents Atlantic-Derived Water (SBAW), which has entered the Barents \nSea between Norway and Bear Island further south (Loeng 1991).  \nThe presence of a front is also indicated by a (relatively weak) correlation between the \ntemperature and the two-day mean of the southward component of the current, particularly in \nthe third year, when the current meter was higher in the water column. When the NBAW \ncurrent is stronger, the interface between NBAW and AW is raised, giving higher temperature \nmeasurements and vice versa. \n \n4.2. Ice thickness data \n \n4.2.1. Interannual variation in ice draft \n \nThere are two possible explanations for the rather large ice drafts in 1994-1995 compared \nwith 1995-1996: either the ice is deformed locally, or it is multiyear ice advected from the \nArctic Ocean. It is impossible to achieve the observed differences in thickness merely through \ndifferences in the rate of thermodynamic freezing. A calculation based on cumulative freezing \ndegree days from the IABP\/POLES surface air temperature fields (Rigor et al. 2000), gave a \nthickness of 126 cm by the end of March, 1995 vs. 122.5 cm in 1996, using the (empirical) \nthermodynamic growth equation of Lebedev (cited in Wadhams 2000), \nH=1.33\u03b80.58 \nwhere \u03b8 denotes the cumulative freezing degree-days and H is the ice thickness in cm. \nAlthough the actual interannual temperature variations may have been larger than indicated \nby the POLES dataset, they cannot fully explain a difference in ice thickness of more than 1 \nm. Deformation \u2013 ridging and rafting of ice \u2013 is probably also important in this area, since \nthere is relatively little open water and tidal currents are up to 10 cm s-1 amplitude. \n12 \nPeriods with increased concentrations of multiyear ice also occur. SSM\/I-derived \nmultiyear ice fractions (not shown) indicate that a significant part of the ice could be \nmultiyear, especially in late May-June 1995, and, more surprisingly, in January-April 1996. \nAlthough the uncertainties of the multiyear fractions are high, the histogram in June 1995 (see \nfigure 2a) shows a large fraction of thick ice compared with the preceding months, consistent \nwith an increased fraction of multiyear ice.  \n \n4.2.2. Relationship to atmospheric circulation \n \nPast decreases in ice extent in the Arctic Ocean have been linked to atmospheric circulation \nchanges, for example by Maslanik et al. (1996). They go further to hypothesize that these \ncirculation anomalies may be linked to other atmospheric anomalies such as ENSO and NAO \npatterns in the early 1990\u2019s. \nIn the Barents Sea, Kvingedal & Sorteberg (submitted, 2005) found that the sea ice \nextent seems to be related to the cyclone activity in East Siberia and south of the Barents Sea. \nThey found high cyclonic activity in east Siberia to be related to cold winds from the north, \nstimulating ice growth and transport of ice from the Arctic into the Barents Sea. High \ncyclonic activity south of the Barents Sea also gives a larger sea ice extent, because the wind \ndistribution seems to slow the inflowing SBAW. \nFurther east, in the Kara and Laptev Seas, Haas & Eicken (2001) performed late \nsummer measurements of sea ice thickness in 1995 and 1996 using drilling and a towed \nelectromagnetic induction profiler. They found large interannual variability in ice thickness in \nthe Laptev Sea, of the same order as our measurements, but unlike us, they observed greater \nice thickness and concentration in 1996 than 1995. They explained this by noting that the \nmean sea-level pressure charts for July and August show a low pressure over the Barents Sea \n13 \nand a high pressure over the Canadian Basin in 1995, contrasted with the presence of a very \ndeep low pressure centered on the North Pole in 1996. While the pressure distribution in 1995 \nwould cause ice to flow from the Laptev Sea into the Central Arctic, the opposite would occur \nin the Barents Sea, where ice would be forced from the Kara Sea and Central Arctic \nsouthward towards our mooring location. On the contrary, in 1996 we would expect to see a \nnet northward (or northeastward) flow of ice from the Northwestern Barents Sea.  \nVinje (1985) used meteorological charts to estimate the wind speed between \nNordaustlandet and Franz Josef Land, and estimated monthly ice fluxes by assuming that the \nice moved at 1% of the wind speed and had an average concentration of 0.7 and an average \nthickness of 2 m. From this, he calculated monthly and net annual ice volume fluxes from the \nBarents Sea to the Arctic Ocean, from 1968-1977. We have done the same using the 10 m \nwind fields from the NCEP reanalysis for 1994-1996. The results are shown in table 3. Given \nthe large interannual variations in ice draft observed here, Vinje\u2019s assumption of a constant 2 \nm ice thickness is not valid in our case. This type of calculation therefore provides only order \nof magnitude estimates of the ice flux. During the months when sea ice was present, these \nvalues are highly correlated with the Polar Pathfinder satellite-derived ice velocities (Fowler \n2003) integrated across the area between Nordaustlandet and Franz Josef Land, although the \nice velocity appears to be on the order of 0.4% of the wind speed, rather than Vinje\u2019s 1%. \nWe found a strong correlation (0.62) between the monthly average N\/S component of \nour current measurements and these ice fluxes, with a one-month lag applied to the currents. \nThis would indicate that the flux of ice as well as of NBAW is largely controlled by the wind \nacross this passage. In turn, these winds are controlled by the large-scale atmospheric \ncirculation in the Arctic, particularly the Northern Annular Mode (Krahmann & Visbeck \n2003; Thompson & Wallace 2000). \n14 \nAs shown in table 3, Vinje (1985) found that ice is normally imported from the Arctic \nOcean in November-March, and exported into the Arctic Ocean in April-June; this is based on \nan average of ten years of data. We note that in October-November 1994 and January 1995 \nice import is large. Apart from June 1995, when there is a very small export, the rest of 1995 \nhas ice fluxes into the Barents Sea. In 1994 and 1996 we see exports in March and June-\nSeptember. This leads to much lower flux estimates for 1994 and 1996 compared with 1995. \nThe seasonal fluxes from September-August show that more ice is imported from the Arctic \nOcean in 1994-1995 than in 1995-1996, although the difference here is smaller. Most of our \nmagnitudes measured are larger than Vinje's, probably because of his longer averaging period. \nThe AO index (Thompson & Wallace 2000) was positive for most of 1994, decreasing \nsharply in February 1995, and fluctuating around a slightly negative value for the remainder \nof our study period. This would give southeasterly winds in the Barents Sea in 1994, causing \nincreased ice convergence and deformation during the freezing season, while the opposite was \nthe case in 1995-1996. This may also have contributed to the large difference in ice thickness. \n \n4.2.3. Reduction of ice thickness in March 1996 \n \nShort-scale episodes and features in the data can be interpreted using SSM\/I-derived ice \nconcentrations (Cavalieri et al., 1990-2002), together with SLP fields from the NCEP\/NCAR \nreanalysis (NCEP 2003). An example is the episode with reduced ice drafts in mid-March \n1996. Satellite-derived ice concentrations are plotted in figure 7, and provide the following \nexplanation for the reduction in draft in mid-March. As a result of strong southwesterly winds \naround March 10-12, the ice started to open up east of Edge\u00f8ya and Nordaustlandet. This \npolynya extended out towards the mooring location, leading to much lower ice thicknesses. \n15 \nSoon after the wind calmed, the opening started to close up, until it was completely closed by \nMarch 20th. The subsequent variation in ice thickness is evident in figure 6. \n \n5. Conclusions \n \nWe have investigated a unique record of ice thicknesses in the northwestern Barents Sea from \n1994-1996, and current and temperature measurements from 1993-1996 in the same location. \nWe have observed higher water temperatures when the southward component of the currents \nwas strongest, and hypothesize that this represents a stronger influx of NBAW, displacing the \nboundary between NBAW and AW upwards. At the same time, there is a clear \ncorrespondence between the meridional wind and ice transport between Nordaustlandet and \nFranz Josef Land, which in turn correlates well with the currents, which they lead by \napproximately one month. We therefore believe that the wind between Nordaustlandet and \nFranz Josef Land plays a key role in driving the exchange of both ice and water between the \nArctic Ocean and the Barents Sea. \nThis is supported by the presence of NBAW in the temperature series in the latter half \nof April and in late June-early July 1995, concurrent with what appears to be multiyear ice, \npresumably from the Arctic Ocean, in the ULS series. In the third year, we see much weaker \nsignals. While it would be a mistake to compare the temperature time series directly, because \nof the difference in instrument depths, it seems likely that the NBAW flux this year is lower, \nprobably also contributing to the lower ice drafts but larger ice extent observed that year. The \nreversal in currents this year supports the conclusion that the NBAW flux is weakened, also \nleading to lower (or even reversed) AW transports. \nWe have observed that interannual variations in mean ice draft can be extremely large, \non the order of 1 m, in the northwestern Barents Sea, and are probably driven partly by \n16 \nAtlantic influx and partly by wind circulation, both of which may be correlated to the \nNAO\/AO (Furevik 2001; Schauer et al. 1997), but with different time lags. \n \n6.
