Introduction \n \nThe art of engine-health monitoring (EHM) is becoming more complex as the array of \ntechnologies available increases.  However, core-engine performance monitoring \ntechniques continue to be the prime diagnosis tool, whereby the analysis of the gas-\nturbine\u2019 s gas-path parameters provides information about the degradation severity of \neach gas-path component [1].  In addition, other technologies such as wear-debris \nanalysis and vibration monitoring also remain key techniques of EHM.  As computing \npower continues to increase and more-mathematical tools become available for the \nEHM of gas-turbines, the available artificial intelligence grows in complexity.   \n \nThe cost of an aircraft\u2019 s diversion in flight for a technical reason is potentially high. The \nresulting loss of passenger confidence leading to a longer-term reduced revenue, short-\nterm costs associated with the diversion (e.g. hotels, transport) and operational \ninconvenience (e.g. the aircraft being unavailable at the required airport for the next \nplanned trip, as well as the disruptions to crew rosters and aircrew duty times) can be \nvery expensive.  The consequences incurred in the ditching of a plane or a catastrophic \nfailure are even higher. In addition, for military aircraft, the results of direct mission \nfailure and adverse effects on other aircraft can be very grave \n \n 4 \nIn order to achieve excellent in-service use of modern gas-turbine aero-engines, they \nshould incorporate capable performance-monitoring systems.  However, the ability of \nsuch a diagnostic system is reliant upon complying with the following criteria: \n \n\u2022 Well-defined reliability goals: for instance, Rolls-Royce have sought \nto improve despatch reliability of the Boeing 767 from 99.91% to \n99.95% by incorporating EHM on the RB211-535E4 [2]. \n\u2022 Physical-space limitations for system hardware. \n\u2022 A well-defined system specification: for example, definition of the end \nuser as either maintenance personnel, aircrew or original equipment \nmanufacturer. \n\u2022 Format of information output:- cockpit indication, ground maintenance \ntrending by operator or third-party telemetric monitoring. \n\u2022 Cost. \n\u2022 Data-processing procedure. \n\u2022 Changes to the above criteria depending on whether or not the EHM \nsystem is designed-in or retrofitted. \n \n2.  Engine-Health Monitoring  \n \n2.1  Overview \n \nThe specialist EHM discipline, of is a desirable aspect of modern aero-engine gas-\nturbine management, provides engine-fleet managers with a tool for the pro-active \nmanagement of assets.   \n \nThe definition of the word health is \u2018a state of being well and free from illness; a \ncondition of the body\u2019 .  This immediately sets EHM apart from the concept of usage, \nwhich is \u2018the manner of using or treating something; customary practice\u2019 .  Nevertheless, \nthere is often a misunderstanding of the difference between an EHM system and Engine \nHealth and Usage Management System (EHUMS): EHM provides an assessment of the \ncurrent state of an engine and EHUMS is both an assessment of the current state and the \ncommon use of the engine.   \n \nAccording to Green [3], a form of \u2018sensing, learning and reasoning EHM system is the \ncornerstone or more importantly the missing link between our current diagnostic \nconfused state, and a status of a true diagnostic with prognostic, or knowledge with \nwisdom capability\u2019 .   The message was that \u2018smart\u2019  EHM was required and led to the \nevolution of EHM\/diagnostics towards EHM\/diagnostics\/ prognostics. \n \n2.2 Traditional Forms of EHM \n \nThese have been described extensively by Li [1], Alcock [4], Theriault [5], Escher [6],  \nand Powrie and Fisher [7].  EHM itself has long been recognised as only a part of an \nengine-monitoring system (EMS); an EMS includes considerations of the associated \npeople, equipment and procedures involved in gas-turbine engine monitoring [8]. \n \n 5 \n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Bolthole crack in the F-100 stage 10 disc \n \nThe EHM process, must be able to assess the performance of the engine and also its \nmechanical integrity. Figure 1 illustrates the type of damage that needs to be detected.  \nThe challenge is usually complicated by the requirement to conduct the EHM with the \nengine \u2018on wing\u2019 , or installed.  EHM can be divided into a number of technologies: \nwear-debris analysis, gas-path performance, visual inspection, vibration analysis and \nlife usage.  Table 1 summarises, the technologies available and the types of health-\nassessment techniques utilised.   \n \nTable 1 \u2013 Summary of traditional EHM methods \nEHM Method Assessment based on: Monitoring Technique Features \nWear Debris \nAnalysis \nMeasurement of mechanical \ndebris arising due to wear of \ncomponents such as \nbearings and shafts \nVisual via magnetic \nchip plug \n \nRapid assessment \n \nTrending \n \nGas-path \nPerformance \n \nMonitoring of engine-\ndependent parameters such \nas pressures, temperatures \nand spool speeds \u2013 \ncomparison with baseline \nvalues and inference of \nindependent parameter \nchanges \n \nSensor based \n \nTrending \n \nUnless linked to \ndiagnostic system, \nrequires manual \nassessment of data \n \nVisual Inspection \nNon-destructive external \nand internal visual \ninspection techniques (for \ngas-path components) using \nliquid penetrants, eddy \ncurrent, ultrasound, \nradiography and\/or lasers  \nHuman eye using \nrigid\/flexible \nborescopes \nRapid assessment \n \nEngine may require \npartial strip \n \nQuality of \nassessment is \nhighly dependent \nupon the  \nexperience of the \ntechnician \nCrack \n 6 \nVibration Analysis \nMonitoring of vibration \ncharacteristics and \ncomparison of actual values \nwith baseline figures \nSensor based \nRapid assessment \n \nQuality of \nassessment is \nhighly dependent \nupon the \nexperience of the \ntechnician \nLife Usage \nLife monitoring of gas-\nturbine systems; life \ndependent upon creep and \nlow cycle fatigue \nSensor based \nPrediction and \nprevention of early \nfailure \n \nLife calculation \nbased on mission \nprofile; can be \nsubjective \n \nMost EHM processes combine the technologies available; for instance a gas-path \nperformance assessment might be confirmed or supported by a vibration analysis.  Gas-\npath performance monitoring techniques include both linear and non-linear gas-path \nanalyses (GPAs). \n \n2.3  Emerging Forms of EHM \n \nTwo examples are shown in Table 2.  The state of an engine can be inferred by \nmonitoring the electrostatic charge of particles entering, travelling through or departing \nfrom an open-flow system.  Electrostatic technology has the ability to classify fault \nseverity in real-time with an early-warning capability.   \nTable 2 \u2013 Summary of emerging EHM methods \n \nEHM Method Assessment based on: Monitoring technique Features \nElectrostatics \nMonitoring the electrostatic \ncharacteristics of debris in \ndifferent parts of the engine: \n \nInlet-Debris Monitoring \nSystem (IDMS) \n  \nExhaust-Debris Monitoring \nSystem (EDMS) \n \nOil-Line Sensor (OLS) \n \nSensor based \nReal-time: \n \nEarly warning of \nfaults \n \nSeverity of fault \npredicted so \nbenefiting the \nmaintenance \noperation \n \nOLS can detect \nnon-metallic debris \n 7 \nRadar \n \nMonitoring of radar \nsignature at pre-defined \nlocations in the gas-turbine \n \nSensor based \nReal-time: \n \nDebris ingestion \n\/damage severity \ninformation \n \nPotential for \nvibration \nmonitoring \n \nData processed into \n\u2018go\/no-go\u2019  format \n \nRadar technology offers similar benefits to electrostatics, but has the added advantage \nthat vibration monitoring could be applied simultaneously.  As EHM costs require \ncareful control, the use of multi-function of a single-sensor is an appealing attribute. \n \n3.  Artificial Neural networks \n \n3.1  Background \n \nA neural network is a system composed of many simple processing-elements, operating \nin parallel and whose function is determined by the network structure, connection \nstrengths: the processing is performed at computing elements or nodes.  Neural network \ndesigns are inspired by the architectures of biological nervous systems, which use many \nsimple processing elements, operating in parallel, to obtain high computation-rates.  \nThese mathematical neuron models are commonly referred to as artificial neural \nnetworks (ANNs).  Unlike the classical digital-processing techniques used by most \ncomputers, ANNs possess the ability to [9][10]: \n \n\u2022 Perform parallel processing of data \n\u2022 Cope with noisy data \n\u2022 Cope with system faults \n\u2022 Adapt to different circumstances  \n \nDigital computers process data serially in real-time, but the downside is that they have \nto prioritise tasks.  However, ANNs process data asynchronously in real-time, which \nmeans they can cope with multiple simultaneous inputs without detriment to the quality \nof the output. \n \nThe human nervous-system was partially understood by the Greeks in 200 BC. By the \nlate 1800s, sensory processing was already being described as a switching network.  In \n1957, Rosenblatt conceived the \u2018perceptron\u2019  neural network [11], i.e. a relatively simple \nnetwork \u2018whose weights and biases could be trained to produce a correct target vector \nwhen presented with the corresponding input vector\u2019  [12].  The limitations of the \nperceptron model were highlighted in 1968 and the evolution of neural networks slowed \nuntil the 1980s.  Understanding of neural networks improved rapidly thereafter [11]. \n \n 8 \nANNs can mean different things to different people.  Mathematicians and physicists \nconsider neural networks to be dynamic systems via which problems are solved through \nrelaxation processes.  In each such network, the energy state moves towards an energy \nminimum that corresponds to a solution.  The Hopfield network is a classic example \n[11].  Biologists and psychologists, however, see ANNs as a means of implementing a \nvariety of cognitive and sub-cognitive functions, as interpreted by Grossberg [11].  \nFinally, there is the understanding of ANNs by an engineer, who will identify the most \nappropriate optimal network design, and apply it to the task to be solved.  The common \ntheme throughout the different interpretations, however, is that ANNs are dynamic, i.e. \npossess the ability to change with time. \n \n3.2  The Human Brain \n \nANNs are modelled on the structure and behaviour of neurons and synapses in the \nhuman brain.  Therefore it is desirable to understand the operation of a human neuron \nprior to investigating the structure of an ANN.  A neuron consists of a cell body with a \nnumber of dendrites and a single axon.  The dendrites supply a means of inputting the \nsignals from other neurons into the cell body and the axon provides a means of \noutputting the signal from the cell body to other neurons.  The architecture is shown in \nFigure 2. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 \u2013 The human neuron \n \nA neuron does nothing unless the collective influence of all its inputs reaches a \nthreshold level, above which the neuron produces a full-strength output in the form of a \nnarrow pulse that proceeds from the cell body, down the axon, and enters the axon \nbranches.  The neuron is said to \u201cfire\u201d in such an event [13].  The dendrites can provide \nmany inputs but the axons supply far fewer outputs.  Between an axon and the dendrite \nDendrites \nNucleus \nAxon \nTerminal \nButtons \nAxon \nhillock \nSoma \nSynapse \n \nSignal Flow \nInput \nOutput \n 9 \nof an adjacent neuron, there exists a synapse, i.e. a link consisting of a pre-synaptic \nmembrane and a post-synaptic membrane.  Between these membranes, there is a \nsynaptic gap.  As a signal leaves a neuron via the axon, a voltage is induced across the \nsynaptic gap and acts as a neuro-transmitter providing an adjacent dendrite with a \nneuro-signal.   \n \nThe stimulation at a synapse can either encourage or discourage the neuron to fire.  The \ndescription so far has been for one or two neurons. Before discussing ANNs, one should \nrealise that there are ~1011 neurons in a human brain and a single neuron can receive \ninputs from as many as 105 synapses [13]. \n \n4.  Diagnostics for a High BPR Turbofan \n \n4.1  Data Generation \n \nIn the absence of real engine-data, it was necessary to use a gas-turbine performance \nmodel to generate the required data for application to a neural network. For this \npurpose, a simulation program called \u201cTurbomatch\u201d, developed at Cranfield University, \nwas used.  However, the first step in setting up the diagnostic process was to decide on \nthe design-point at which the work was to be conducted.  Given that the performance \ndata were available for take-off under ISA SLS conditions, it was chosen as the design \npoint.  The second step was then to establish the performance parameters required to \nsimulate the behaviour of the appropriate version of the engine: i.e. \n \n\u2022 TET \n\u2022 EGT \n\u2022 Compressor\u2019 s Pressure-Ratio \n\u2022 Thrust \n\u2022 Mass Flow-Rate \n\u2022 OPR \n \nIt was then intended to modify the Turbomatch simulation so as to achieve the desired \ntake-off thrust along with the appropriate values of the TET, EGT, compressor pressure-\nratios and OPR.  However, it soon became apparent that, to achieve the desired result, \nmodifying the model had to be an iterative process.  Hence, many of the parameters \nended up with significant percentage differences between the provided and actual \nvalues.  Thrust and TET are arguably the most important to keep as close to reality as \npossible: thrust so as to maintain the specified value and TET at a level that does not \nexceed the cooling ability and \u2018lifing\u2019  criteria.  The percentage difference values were \nan undesirable feature of the model, since the errors could be of the same magnitude as \nthose of the faults that were ultimately being simulated.   \n \nIn order to assess the health of a gas-turbine engine and ultimately provide a diagnosis \nconcerning any detected faults, it is desirable to have data that relate dependent (engine \nmeasurements) to independent (performance) parameters under a number of conditions.   \n \n 10 \nThe Turbomatch program has the ability to simulate the behaviour of an engine as well \nas the effects of implanted faults in its engine components, for instance a reduction in \ncomponent efficiency or mass flow capacity.  Turbomatch was therefore used to \ngenerate data for the effects of various engine-component deteriorations. \n \nTable 3 \u2013 Planned double-component independent parameter deviations \n \nComponent 1 Deviations Component 2 Deviations Component Pair \nComponents 1+2 \n%K %* %K %* \nIPC + HPC -5 -15 -3 -9 \nIPC + HPT -5 -15 -5 +10 \nIPC + IPT -5 -15 -2.5 +5 \n \nThe relationship between physical degradation and simulated degradation is realised by \nchoosing certain ratios between component efficiency and mass-flow capacity \ndegradations.  The exact ratios chosen can be open to some individual subjectivity and \nso it was worthwhile establishing the values of their ratios commonly concluded from \nprevious research [6][14].  The ratio of efficiency to mass flow capacity chosen for \ncomponent 1 in all the pairs and component 2 in the IPC+HPC pair was 1:3.  This \nrepresented the effect of compressor fouling [6].  The ratio of efficiency to mass flow \ncapacity for component 2 in the IPC+HPT and IPC+IPT pairs was chosen to be 1:2, \nwhich is typical of the effect of erosion of the turbine [6]. See Table 3. \n \nSome of the key factors that should be considered before attempting practical network \ntraining are included in Table 4: whilst there are other factors, many of the \nconsiderations will be common. \n \nTable 4 \u2013 Factors to consider prior to ANN use \n \nFactor Reason for consideration \nKey objective: fault approximation or classification  Must not lose sight of the main goal of the study \nEngine component to be investigated \nCan realistic data be generated or obtained for the \nchosen engine component(s)? \nNumber of data points to be generated or obtained \nNetwork training period is a function of the number \nof points to be processed \nType of ANN design to be used throughout the \nstudy \nCredible comparison of results with previous \nconclusions \nRecommendations from previous studies Avoidance of (i) duplication and (ii) wasted effort \nBackstop date for completion of practical \ninvestigation \nAllow enough time for analysis and discussion of \nthe derived data \n \n 11 \n4.2  Strategy and Plan \n \nPrevious studies demonstrate that ANNs, trained with simulated data representing \nengine degradation, can be used for diagnostic purposes [4].  Two respected sources for \nresearch have included a requirement to assess ANN performance when the engine \nsuffers multiple-component faults [4][5].  Hence this study considered multiple-\ncomponent faults, which occur commonly in  gas-turbine aero engines.

The ANN does not need to know the intended use of \nthe output and this is therefore an attractive feature, since the potential uses are \nlimitless.  For the reasons mentioned, the data sets are presented in \u201cnumbers-only\u201d \nformat and do not require any data labels.  The engine data were initially mixed with a \nsignal that was meant to represent sensor noise.  The actual noise was generated \nrandomly for each set of 11 engine parameters; the magnitudes employed were the same \nas those used for a sensor suite studied by Ogaji, et al [10] - see Table 5. \n \n \n \n 12 \nTable 5 \u2013 Sensor\u2019s Noise Levels \n \nEngine \nParameter \nDescription \nNoise +\/- (% of \nrange) \nN1 LP relative spool speed 0.03 \nN2 IP relative spool speed 0.03 \nN3 HP relative spool speed 0.02 \nP3 Fan\u2019 s exit total-pressure (bar) 0.10 \nP5 LPC\u2019 s exit total-pressure (bar) 0.10 \nT3 Fan\u2019 s exit total temperature (K) 0.40 \nT5 LPC\u2019 s exit total temperature(K) 0.40 \nT10 LPT\u2019 s inlet temperature(K) 0.40 \nT12 IPT\u2019 s inlet temperature (K) 0.40 \nT13 HPT\u2019 s inlet temperature (K) 0.40 \nWf Fuel flow (Kg\/s) 0.40 \n \nOnce the noise was superimposed, the data were normalised.

Furthermore, only three pairs, out of a \npossible 15 fault combinations, are investigated.  \n \nThe three ANNs, one for each DCF combination, were trained and tested: and Figure 5 \nshows the arising performance summaries for the investigated fault-quantification \nnetworks.

However, the magnitude of the standard deviation for the double-component \nnetworks would be expected to be higher than for the single-component ones.  \nSecondly, the IPC has a consistently poor comparative performance regardless of the \npairing; although this is within the context of relatively low overall standard deviations.    \n \nFurthermore, the mean error for the IPC is relatively high.  For instance, the lowest \ndeviation for the IPC efficiency is 0.5% and therefore a mean error of 0.135 (see   \nFigure 6) means that the spread of actual values for a nominal 0.5% could be 0.365 to \n0.635.  If the standard deviation of 0.105 (see Figure 5), is then taken into account, the \nspread of possible values for a nominal 0.5% degradation in IPC efficiency could be \n0.26 to 0.74%.  This degree of accuracy represents a 50% possible variation on the \nnominal value.  The accuracies for each component vary depending on the particular \npairing, but an inspection of the standard deviation and mean error plots shows only a \n 14 \nsmall variation in the value of the respective parameters.  This basic assessment could \nbe conducted for all the components: it illustrates 2 key findings:-   \n \n\u2022 The accuracy established may be unacceptable if the gas-turbine under \ninvestigation has very small degradations in efficiency. \n \n\u2022 Considering either the standard deviation or the mean error in isolation is \ninadequate for assessing network performance. \n \n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\n0.25\n0.3\nIPC HPC IPC HPT IPC IPT\nComponent Pair\nM\nea\nn\n \nEr\nro\nr \n(%\n)\nMean Efficiency\nMean Mass Flow Capacity\n \nFigure 6 \u2013 Double-component network performance summary \n- Mean error \n- 1000 epochs\/20_20_4\/DCF approximation\/SCG \nThe proposed magnitudes of the engine deteriorations have already been mentioned.  \nHowever, during the process of assembling the 8668 combinations of efficiency and \nmass flow capacity for both chosen components, the planned combined magnitudes of \nthe deviations were not included.  Table 6 gives the planned magnitudes and the \ncorresponding maximum values.  It would have been desirable to include the planned \nvalues, however, the actual values used are equally as valid.  For instance, it is just as \nlikely that one component will suffer more degradations than its partner, in the chosen \npairs, as it would be that both should suffer the same degree of damage.  \n \nTable 6 \u2013 Planned and actual double-component independent parameter \ndeviations \n \nComponent 1 Deviations Component 2 Deviations Component Pair \nComp1 + Comp2 \nDeviation \nCombination \nDescription %('K) %('*) %('K) %('*) \n 15 \nPlanned -5 -15 -3 -9 \nActual 1 -5 -15 -0.5 -1 IPC + HPC \nActual 2 -0.5 -15 -3 -9 \nPlanned -5 -15 -5 +10 \nActual 1 -5 -15 -0.5 +1 IPC + HPT \nActual 2 -0.5 -15 -5 +10 \nPlanned -5 -15 -2.5 +5 \nActual 1 -5 -15 -0.5 +1 IPC + IPT \nActual 2 -4.5 -1 -2.5 +5 \n  \nIt is worth noting again that the ratio of deterioration for each of the component\u2018s \nindependent parameters is equally important to the relative magnitudes.  The ratio of \nefficiency to mass flow capacity for component 1 of all the pairs in the \u2018Actual 1\u2019  case \nremains as 1:3, which represents compressor fouling [6].  The same ratio for component \n2 of the IPC+HPT and IPC+IPT pairs in the \u2018Actual 1\u2019  case is 1:2, which is the same \nratio as the planned value.  A ratio of 1:2 for a turbine represents erosion [6].  Finally, \nthe only discrepancy is that for component 2 of the IPC+HPC pair, the ratio is 1:2 rather \nthan the planned 1:3. \n \nFor the \u2018Actual 2\u2019  case that refers to the correct maximum deviations for component 2 \nfor all pairs, unfortunately, all the deviations for component 1 for all pairs were not as \nplanned.  Although, as has already been discussed, there are many combinations of \nefficiency and mass flow capacity, the ratios for the component 1, \u2018Actual 2\u2019  case for all \npairs do not represent any particular engine degradation regime such as fouling or \nerosion. \n \nAs a footnote to these observations, it should be noted that the two \u2018actual\u2019  \ncombinations quoted are only 2 of the possible 8668 combinations.  However, they do \nrepresent the two combinations that include the maximum deteriorations of either \ncomponent 1 or component 2. \n 16 \n0.0E+00\n4.0E-03\n8.0E-03\n1.2E-02\n1.6E-02\nIPC + HPC IPC + HPT IPC + IPT\nComponent Combination\nM\nSE\n \n(%\n)\n \nFigure 7 \u2013 Double-component network performance summary \n\u2013 Mean square error \n \nThe aim of an approximation ANN, or fault approximation ANN, is for it to be able to \napproximate an output based on a set of received data.  Furthermore, the output \nproduced by the ANN occurs after it has been trained with a set of pertinent data; \ntypical errors introduced during training are shown in Figure 7.  It was therefore useful \nto assess how well the test target and the actual output were correlated.  Initially, the \nchallenge of assessing the correlation of 8668 data sets was considered.  It was decided \nto choose 200 data sets at each of the beginning, middle and end of the 8668 range: the \n200 data set choice and that of the 3 samples were both arbitrary decisions. For \nexample, the correlations for the IPC+HPC combinations for the data sets 1 200 and \n8468 8668 are shown in Figures 8 to 11. It should be noted that a network, described \nas 11-20-20-4, implies a structure with 11 input measurements, 20 neurons in each \nhidden layer, and four output possibilities. Because the number of input measurements \nis fixed, sometimes it may not be included in the network definition. \n \nOverall the results show a reasonably good correlation between \u2018test target\u2019  and \u2018test \nactual\u2019  data.  For the efficiency plots, there is a consistently good correlation with only \nsome scatter for the IPC.  The mass-flow capacity correlates well with the target apart \nfrom some scatter for the IPC plots for the first 200 data sets. \n \nHaving completed a correlation assessment using the above technique, another \nalternative method was identified.  This second method utilised a mathematical function \ncalled the coefficient of correlation and a summary for the component pairs is shown in \nFigure 12.  The second method allowed a single number to be quoted as a measure of \nperformance.  For instance, the coefficient of correlation for the IPC+HPC pairing IPC \nefficiency was approximately 99.98%.  The worst performer was the IPT efficiency for \nthe IPC+IPT component pair.  \n 17 \n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1 21 41 61 81 101 121 141 161 18 1 201\nD ata  S et (1  to  200  o f 8668)\nE\nffi\nci\nen\ncy\n \nD\net\ner\nio\nra\ntio\nn\n \n%\nIP C  T est T arget H P C  T est T arget IP C  T est A ctual H P C  T est A ctual\n \nFigure 8  - Network test performance  \n\u2013 IPC + HPC (data set 1-200) \n\u2013 1276 epochs\/20_20_4\/IPC+HPC\/SCG \n0\n0 .5\n1\n1 .5\n2\n2 .5\n3\n1 21 41 61 81 101 121 141 161 181 201\nD ata S et (1  to 200  of 8668)\nM\na\nss\n \nFl\no\nw\n \nC\na\npa\nci\nty\n \nD\net\ner\nio\nra\ntio\nn\n \n%\nIP C  Test Target H P C  Test Target IP C  Test A ctual H P C  Test A ctual\n \nFigure 9 - Network test performance  \n\u2013 IPC + HPC (data set 1-200) \n- 1276 epochs\/20_20_4\/IPC+HPC\/SCG \n 18 \n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n1 21 41 61 81 101 121 141 161 181 201\nData Set (8468  to 8668  of 8668)\nEf\nfic\nie\nn\ncy\n \nD\net\ner\nio\nra\ntio\nn\n \n%\nIPC  Test Target H PC  Test Target IPC  Test Actual H PC  Test Actual\n \nFigure 10 \u2013 Network test performance \n\u2013 IPC + HPC (data sets 8468-8668) \n- 1276 epochs\/20_20_4\/IPC+HPC\/SCG \n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\n1 21 41 61 81 101 121 141 161 181 201\nData Set (8468 to 8668 of 8668)\nM\na\nss\n \nFl\no\nw\n \nC\na\npa\nci\nty\n \nD\net\ner\nio\nra\ntio\nn\n \n%\nIPC Test Target HPC Test Target IPC Test Actual HPC Test Actual\n \nFigure 11 \u2013 Network test performance \n           \u2013 IPC + HPC (data sets 8468-8668) \n - 1276 epochs\/20_20_4\/IPC+HPC\/SCG \n 19 \n0.9\n0.9\n0.9\n0.9\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\nIPC HPC IPC HPT IPC IPT\nComponent Pair\nC\no\nef\nfic\nie\nn\nt o\nf C\no\nrr\nel\na\ntio\nn\nEfficiency Mass Flow Capacity\n \nFigure 12 \u2013 Coefficient of correlation for DCF approximation \n              -1000 epochs\/20_20_4\/DCF\/SCG \n \nThe data used to train and test the 3 individual ANNs were used for an ANN with 3 \noutputs.

Discussion \n \nThe results obtained for the double-component faults highlighted some general \nobservations concerning the feasibility of networks for diagnostics.  Regardless of \nwhich components were paired, each engine component had an individual network \nperformance.  For instance, the IPC was in each of the pairs, but had an almost constant \nstandard deviation, mean error and coefficient of correlation regardless of the chosen \npartner.  The absolute values for the previously mentioned parameters were valid only \nfor the deteriorated data-set generated.  It was not, however, possible to verify that this \nconstant performance held true for all the components, since not all the pair \ncombinations were investigated. \n \nThe actual deteriorated data generated, i.e. 8668 sets for the double-components, \nincorporated a large degree of randomness.  Close inspection of the efficiencies and \nmass flow capacities chosen revealed that, although there were logical trends, the actual \nvalues were random.  The assessment of the network performance, therefore, was \nconducted with the assumption of random deterioration.  Such an assumption would \nmodel realistically the effects of real-life engine deteriorations, but it was noted that a \nfull network performance assessment should also include an entirely non-randomly \ngenerated data-set. \n \nThe optimal network structure used was 2 hidden layers of 20 neurons and an output \nlayer of 4 neurons, i.e. the 20_20_4 structure.  The network structure was only one of \nseveral criteria that needed to be considered.  It would have been less objective to assess \nthe operation of the networks by quoting only one of the criteria, namely: the structure \ndetails; MSE; mean error, standard deviation for the test or coefficient of correlation. \n \nFrom a practical point-of-view, the above statements clarified the notion that the use of \nANNs has an arbitrary aspect to them.  It was clear that much more investigation would \nbe needed before a realistic view of the feasibility of ANNs for the present \napplicationcould be offered.   \n 21 \nThe data in Table 7 summarise the errors produced for a selection of engine \ndeterioration combinations.  For all of the approximation cases, the absolute errors were \nidentified.  Those highlighted represent the worst two for each case, i.e. single- and \ndouble-component faults.  In particular, the peak errors for the SCF networks were \nabout double the peak errors for the DCF networks.  The results showed that for the \nnetwork design chosen and the constraints applied, the errors were high.  For instance \nan absolute error of 1.56 for the IPC represents a 12.5% variation on the target value.   \n \nTable 7 \u2013 Results for single and double-component fault\/approximation networks \n \nImplanted Fault (%) Predicted Fault (%) \nAbsolute \nEstimation Error \nComponent 1 Component 2 Component 1 Component 2 Component 1 Component 2 Components \n\u0004\n \u0005  \n\u0004\n \u0005  \n\u0004\n \u0005  \n\u0004\n \u0005  \n\u0004\n \u0005  \n\u0004\n \u0005  \nFan -5 -12.5 _ \n_ \n-4.98 -12.37 _ _ 0.02 0.13 _ _ \nIPC -5 -12.5 \n_ _ \n-4.99 -14.06 \n_ _ 0.1 1.56 _ _ \nHPC -5 -12.5 \n_ _ \n-4.11 -12.16 \n_ _ 0.89 0.34 _ _ \nHPT -5 +12.5 \n_ _ \n-4.99 +11.42 \n_ _ 0.01 1.08 _ _ \nIPT -5 +12.5 \n_ _ \n-4.94 +12.16 \n_ _ 0.06 0.34 _ _ \nLPT -5 +12.5 \n_ _ \n-4.99 +12.06 \n_ _ 0.01 0.44 _ _ \nIPC+HPC -5 -15 -0.5 -1 -4.65 -14.48 -0.5 -0.88 0.35 0.52 0 0.12 \nIPC+HPT -5 -15 -0.5 +1 -4.81 -14.61 -0.5 +0.74 0.19 0.39 0 0.26 \nIPC+IPT -5 -15 -0.5 +1 -4.83 -14.59 \n-\n0.49 \n+0.86 0.17 0.41 0.01 0.14 \n \nIt would, however, be prudent to conduct an investigation into the relationship between \ntarget data selection and resultant errors.  For instance, altering the training data by a \nsmall arbitrary amount generated the target data, but it might be possible to influence \nthe test performance by changing the test-data generation procedure. \n \nReference to Table 7 would suggest that the performance of the DCF approximation \nnetworks was far better than for the SCF approximation networks.  However, on \nbalance, the results for the SCFs are better, which as discussed already was not \nexpected. \n \nThe coefficient of correlation was used as one of the methods for assessing ANN \nperformance.  This means of assessment was just as useful for the component pairs as it \nwas for the single-components.  In addition, just as for the single-components, it was \n 22 \nused most effectively in conjunction with other means of assessment like mean error \nand standard deviation.  \n \nThe performance of an approximation ANN can be reduced by as much as 3% due to \nthe loss, or degradation, of a sensor [4].  All the results obtained were not subject to any \nkind of sensor fault or degradation.  Given that the data sets used included 11 dependent \nparameters, the probability of either sensor failure or degradation would in reality be \nfairly high.  It would be reasonable to suggest that the probability of sensor problems \nwould be a direct function of the number of sensors.  The results lacked a degree of \ncredibility that could have been provided by considering sensor faults.  Future studies \nshould therefore include this aspect of ANN assessment. \n \n7.  Conclusions \n \nFrom the double-component fault approximation investigation, it can be concluded that: \n \n1. The average standard deviation was similar, if not slightly better, than for \nthe single-component faults; in reality the ANN error would rise with an \nincrease in the number of engine components considered. \n \n2. Generally the ANN performance for the double engine-component faults \nwas good and the ANN for the IPC+HPC pair performed marginally better than  \nfor the other 2 pairs. \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Li, I Y.
