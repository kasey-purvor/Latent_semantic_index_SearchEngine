The theories are presented here as tools\nwhich may help to guide the data analysis.  Social\nidentity is based on self-definition as a group\nmember and the values and connotations attached\nto it.  SIT proposes that individuals strive to\nmaintain a positive social identity, by favourably\nevaluating their ingroups (Tajfel & Turner, 1986).\nFurther elaboration came from the development\nof self-categorisation theory (SCT). SCT proposes\nthat when social identity becomes more important\nthan personal identity, individuals become\ndepersonalised \u2013 they view themselves as more\nsimilar to prototypical members of their category\n(Oakes, Haslam & Turner, 1994).  It is particularly\nimportant to bear in mind that identity within SCT is\nfluid and dynamic, and very much context-\ndependant. Individuals can be seen as different in\none context (e.g. Asian and White Britons as mem-\nbers of different religions), but then can be\nre-categorised and seen as similar in another\ncontext (e.g. Asian and White Britons as British\ncitizens).\nNational Identity\nIt has been suggested that there are two models\nof the nation \u2013 civic and ethnic (Smith, 1991).   The\ncivic model is based on a political community in\nwhich its members are brought together with all the\nlegal and civic rights of     citizenship, irrespective\nof ethnic background. The ethnic model, on the\nother hand, is based primarily on ancestry and an\nidea of a common descent of its members.  Smith\nalso suggests that there are five fundamental\nfeatures of a national identity, with different subsets\nemphasised in the civic vs. ethnic models.  These\nare (i) an historic territory, or homeland, (ii) common\nmyths and historical memories, (iii) a common\nmass public culture, (iv) common legal rights and\nduties for all members, and (v) a common economy\nwith territorial mobility for members.  As well as\nthese features, Barrett (in press) suggests\nadditional features.  Some of these are cognitive,\nsuch as categorising oneself as part of a national\ngroup, knowledge of national emblems, beliefs\nabout   common descent and kinship of group\nmembers, and beliefs about group\ncharacteristics\/traits of the national group.    Barrett\nalso identifies affective components of national\nidentity, such as the    subjective importance of the\nidentity to the     individual, and the emotional\nattachment to the national group.\n In relation to the affective features of national\nidentity, Kelman (1997) suggests that people may\ndisplay two types of attachments.  The first is\nsentimental, where the attachment is emotional\nand people feel that the group reflects their per-\nsonal identity.  The second is instrumental, and is\nfocussed more on the idea of the nation meeting\nneeds, interests and obligations that accompany\ncitizenship and membership of the national group.\nSocial Identity Threat\n Looking at social identity threat also allows\nresearchers to understand what types of strategies\ngroup members may use to attain a positive social\nidentity.  Branscombe, Ellemers, Spears and\nDoosje (1999) identify four types of threat related to\nsocial identity. Categorisation threat is being\ncategorised against one\u2019s will; distinctiveness\nthreat is where group distinctiveness is prevented\nor undermined; value threat is where the group\u2019s\nvalue is undermined on the dimensions of\ncompetence and morality; and acceptance threat is\nwhere one\u2019s position within the group is\nundermined.\nBritish National Identity\n Jacobson (1997) interviewed young British\nPakistani adults to investigate their notions of\nBritishness.  It was found that for this particular\ngroup of South Asians, national identity did not\nhave a fixed content, but was in fact related to\n\u2018boundaries\u2019.  The three boundaries identified were\nthe \u2018civic\u2019, \u2018racial\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 boundaries.  The first\nrefers to Britain as a political entity, and is based on\ncitizenship.  In this way, it encompasses most\nmembers of minority groups, and is relatively  clear-\ncut.  The second, the \u2018racial\u2019 boundary,   defined\nthose with a British ancestry as being  British.\nBritishness is inevitably seen as a matter of having\nancestral roots, and consequently, being \u2018white\u2019,\nmaking it difficult for visible minorities to identify\nwithin this boundary.  The final boundary, which is\nthe cultural boundary, defined Britishness as \u2018those\nindividuals whose behaviour, lifestyle and   values\nare perceived as typically British\u2019 (p.193).  This is a\nfairly problematic boundary, as British culture may\nbe viewed in different ways, e.g. being attached to\nthe cultural heritage, language or   established\nreligion of Britain.  Alternatively, it may mean to\nhave knowledge of famous British  people, modes\nof dress and speech, or to be familiar with political\nand social institutions.\n Jacobson\u2019s findings reveal that although British\nPakistani respondents support integration and\nadopting various aspects of a British life, they often\nfind themselves in conflict with their parents\u2019 ideals\nand their own religious\/ethnic practices. Ballard\n(1994) also argues that, for the British-born\ngeneration, conforming to parents\u2019 expectations\nwithin the home may be fairly easy, but can get\nparticularly difficult when outside the home.  Most\nimportantly of all, there was an overwhelming view\nthat they still felt a minority, and there was a  power-\nful notion held by many of the respondents that\nbeing British fundamentally meant being \u2018white\u2019.\nModood et al. (1997) found that a broadening of\nethnic labels had developed, and second\ngeneration Asians in particular, had taken to\nadopting hybrid identities, e.g. \u2018British-\nBangladeshi\u2019, showing and expressing the impact\nof both cultures on their lives.  Only a handful of the\nsecond generation respondents felt alienated or\nremoved from British culture because it seemed not\ninterested in values pertaining to the family, religion\nand    community.  What is apparent in the\ninterviews, however, is the idea of acceptance from\nthe white Britons; despite being culturally British, it\nwas felt that the attitudes of white people may act\nas a barrier against the respondents calling\nthemselves \u2018British\u2019.\n For many of the South Asian and Caribbean\nrespondents, as with those in the Jacobson (1997)\nstudy, citizenship (i.e. holding a British passport)\nwas important in identifying as British, but was not\nalways meaningful because these individuals would\nnever be white. Acceptance of being British, it\nseemed, lay primarily in the unreasonable demand\nof having to give up the parent culture as a\nresponse to colour exclusion.  Another important\nobservation was that South Asians would identify\nwith aspects of British society, whilst rejecting the\nidea of \u2018being British\u2019.  Modood et al. (1994) argue\nthat this is because they actively participate in\nimportant aspects of British society, yet reserve the\nterm \u2018British\u2019 for the features that they cannot, or\nfeel that they are not allowed to, identify with.\nSecond generation South Asians argued for a more\nbi-cultural view of their identities, but were also\naware that there was often a need to minimise their\nethnic identities in order to be culturally more\naccepted as British (Modood et al., 1994).\n These findings are also echoed in the extensive\nwork carried out by Ghuman (2003), who used both\nquantitative and qualitative measures to study the\nidentities of South Asian adolescents in Britain,\nAustralia, the USA and Canada.  Participants\nfavoured behaviours and attitudes that promoted\nintegration as well as maintaining aspects of their\nethnic heritage.  However, they disagreed with\nold-fashioned and \u2018backward\u2019 behaviours that were\noften expected by their parents.  In general, the\nparticipants seemed to favour biculturalism and\nsought to create new and innovative identities that\nencompassed the best of both ethnic and national\nidentities. Ballard (1994) argues that just as bilin-\ngual individuals use \u2018code-switching\u2019 and can flu-\nently move from one language to another, the same\ncan be said for culture.  People will use different\ncombinations of cultures, according to the specific\ncontexts or situations they find themselves in.  A\ndilemma or conflict they may face, however, is not\nnecessarily derived from the fact that they partici-\npate in these different arenas, but because these\narenas may view each other negatively.\n This study aimed to explore what it means to\nbe British from the perspective of young adult Brit-\nish Indians and Pakistanis.\nMethodology\nSemi-structured interviews were conducted,\nand a grounded theory approach was used to\nanalyse the interviewees\u2019 responses. A total of\nfifteen participants were used for this study which\nincluded eight British Indians, four male and four\nfemale, and seven British Pakistanis, four male and\nthree female.  The interview schedule covered\nitems on self-description and categorisation, patri-\notism, context, sport, multiculturalism, and racism\nand discrimination.\nDiscussion and Results\nThreat\n The respondents were found to draw upon three\ndifferent perspectives of threat: of white British\npeople, of people from their own ethnic group, and\nof their own self-categorisation as British.\n In the first perspective, many of the respondents\nfelt that they were automatically being categorised\nby white British people in terms of their Indian or\nPakistani background, as opposed to their British\nidentities.  This became most apparent when\ninterviewees were asked, \u201cwhat do you say when\nsomeone asks \u2018where do you come from\u2019\u201d?.\n\u2018You know, that\u2019s the thing. When people do sit\nin my car and they say \u2018where do you come\nfrom?\u2019, I say I was born here and they say \u2018no,\nno, no, we mean where do your parents come\nfrom?\u2019, and that just shows straight away, just\ncos I was born here, they won\u2019t accept me like\nthat, but they still look at where my parents\ncome from.\u2019\nThe participants felt that that they were not\naccepted as British perhaps because they did not fit\ninto the racial category of being British, or more\nspecifically, that they did not represent the\nprototypical British person. In one respect, the\nrespondents felt a threat that they were not being\ncategorised or accepted into the British category,\nyet in another, they felt a threat to the value of their\nethnic identity. This was because they felt that white\nBritish people may not necessarily understand their\npractices or family obligations that played a central\nrole in their lives. As a result, many responded\ndefensively, preferring to stress the importance of\ntheir ethnic ingroup and using the British white\ngroup to derogate.\nIn the second perspective a threat from\nmembers of the same ethnic group occurred as a\nresult of mixing with mainly white British friends.\nAlthough mentioned only by two of the respondents,\nmembers of their own ethnic group would often\nclass them as wanting to be \u2018white\u2019. They would not\nnecessarily be accepted into their own ethnic\ngroups (at school in particular), as the idea of\nbiculturalism was uncommon. The term \u2018coconut\u2019\nwas used to highlight the idea of someone who\nwanted to be white, but was seen as Asian because\nof their skin colour only (\u2018brown on the outside,\nwhite on the inside\u2019).\nFinally, the participants\u2019 own categorisation as\nBritish revealed the heterogeneity of the group. A\nPakistani respondent wore traditional clothes on a\ndaily basis as an attempt to assert her\ndistinctiveness as a Pakistani, and not as a Brit.\nFeelings of comfort were also mentioned by an\nIndian female respondent who felt that going to the\npub was not natural in comparison to attending\nreligious or cultural events.  In this light, British\nAsians may be excluding themselves from those\naspects of being British that they do not feel a part\nof.  To be categorised as British does not\nnecessarily mean having to adopt typically British\nbehaviours for these respondents.\nOn the other hand, accepting the majority\nculture and attempting to understand the way of life\nand culture were encouraged by some of the other\nrespondents. Although the strength of identification\nwith the British group was not measured, high\nidentifiers may attempt to gain acceptance by\nparticipating in behaviours seen as typically British\n(e.g. socialising in the pub), whereas low identifiers\nmay be unlikely to take any course of action as they\ndo not feel the need to be accepted.\nContext\nThe fluid and contextual nature of identities\nwas a major theme in the data.  According to\nSCT, personal identity should be more evident\nwhen engaged in intragroup comparisons,\nwhereas social identity should come more into\nplay in intergroup comparative contexts.  The\nmost common finding was the divide between\nprivate and public spheres of the respondents\u2019\nlives. Some went so far as to say they had a\n\u2018split personality\u2019 between their lives within the\nhome and their lives outside the home.\nPrivate spheres\nWithin the home, there was interplay with\nnational, ethnic and religious identities. Many of\nthe Indian respondents said that the home was\na constant reminder of their ethnic identity. The\nimmediate environment served as a frame of\nreference within which the participants were\nable to categorise themselves in terms of their\nreligious or ethnic background.\n\u2018\u2026the way we talk, we talk Gujarati at home,\nor we try to... but when my parents are home\nwe all try and speak Gujarati. Um, we eat\nIndian food\u2026 when we go out we eat Indian,\num, our upbringing, our parents\u2026 You know,\nit\u2019s always, it\u2019s always Indian in our house.\u2019\nContrary to the predictions of SCT, the\nparticipants had a stronger sense of their ethnic\nidentity within the home, despite being within an\nintragroup context where there were no\noutgroup members present as a comparison.\nFor the Indian participants, religious and\nethnic identities were closely related to each\nother, with little differentiation between the two.\nHowever, for the Pakistani respondents,\nreligious aspects of their lives were much more\nimportant. The context of home for a Pakistani\nrespondent was seen as more \u2018religion-\noriented\u2019, and as another male respondent said:\n\u2018\u2026being a Pakistani is one thing, or part of\none thing, but basically we\u2019re Muslim. So\nwe\u2019re Muslim first, it doesn\u2019t really matter, I\nmean I know my parents are from Pakistan,\nbut it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re from Pakistan\nor India, um, being Muslim, I\u2019m Muslim first.\u2019\nPublic spheres\n This idea of a salient Muslim identity was\nalso evident for the Pakistani participants in their\npublic spheres of life. To a certain extent, having\na strong Muslim identity was sometimes a\nbarrier for the respondents.\nFor some, a religious identity often gave\nguidelines to follow, but did not necessarily act\nas a conflict in their lives. In an intergroup\ncontext, a Muslim identity may be more stable\nand enduring than a national or ethnic identity.\nPrevious research has suggested that in\ncomparison to Muslims, Hindu and Sikh\nadolescents are more likely to integrate into the\nwider society (Ghuman, 2003). This idea of\nhaving a distinct personal and public life did not\nseem a conflict for most of the Indian\nparticipants:\n\u2018\u2026the minute you walk through the door into\nyour house, you start associating yourself\nwith Indian culture \u2026 all these little things,\nyou know, it triggers off something in the\nback of your mind to remind you that you are\nbrought up in an Indian community, culture,\nso that is like, \u2018ok, I feel comfortable\u2019. It\u2019s the\nway you were brought up. The minute you\nwalk out of the door, and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to\nthe pub\u2019, it\u2019s like \u2018click\u2019, you forget about the\nother one, your Indian one and you switch\ninto the British one.\u2019\nAs mentioned by Ballard (1994), conflicts\narise when the two cultures view each other\nnegatively or when parents have certain\nexpectations of their British-born offspring.\nWhen questioned about whether having two\ndifferent lifestyles was a problem, an Indian\nfemale replied:\n\u2018I feel I can switch in and out, but it\u2019s usually\nvery seamless, but you know when you try\nand mix the two, like when you tell your mum\nor dad that you\u2019ve gotta go out with friends\nBoundaries of Britishness in British Indians and Pakistanis\nKiren Vadher & Martyn Barrett\nUniversity of Surrey, UK\nPoster presented at the XVIIIth International Congress of the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology, Spetses, Greece, July 11-15, 2006.\n from work, and they want you to stay at home\nand do stuff at home, and it\u2019s really difficult\nbecause they don\u2019t understand that you have to\ndo this stuff\u2026 They don\u2019t see that we need to\nhave a life outside of the home and socialise\nwith other people cos that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re\ngonna go above and beyond what you\u2019re doing,\nin terms of like work and career.\u2019\nWhat seems to be evident in the idea of\ndifferences between the private and public spheres\nof life is that most of the respondents felt a need to\nbe able to change according to the situation and\ncontext they found themselves in.  Thus, self-\ncategorisation resulted not only from the similarities\nand differences between one group and another,\nbut also from the individual\u2019s own goals, motives\nand expectations.\nFriends\nThe idea of social circles was also found to be\ncontext-dependent. When around white English\nfriends, many felt British or British Indian\/Pakistani\nbecause it would often bring out behaviours seen\nas typically British, such as drinking in the pub.\nBeing with friends sharing the same ethnic\nbackground allowed the respondents to joke in the\nsame language and feel a connection with each\nother. They shared more similarities because of\ntheir mutual understanding of each others\u2019 family\nlife, obligations, and because many went through\nthe same issues.\nHoliday\nMany participants gave examples of going on holi-\nday as bringing out their British identity.   When\nquestioned on holiday about where they came from,\nmany would reply as British and would be perceived\nas British because of their accents.  When meeting\npeople from other countries, the salience of their\nBritish identity was rendered prominent, highlight-\ning that they were \u2018British\u2019 Indians and Pakistanis.\nWhen visiting their parents\u2019 countries of origin, even\nthose who primarily identified within their ethnic or\nreligious background still felt \u2018different\u2019 when in\nIndia or Pakistan, highlighting their British identity.\nOne of the male Indian respondents described his\nlack of acceptance and belonging in India as well as\nin Britain:\n\u2018If you\u2019re in this country, you\u2019re seen as a for-\neigner, whether you\u2019re British or not, because of\nthe colour of your skin, that\u2019s a fact. If you go to\nIndia, you\u2019re a foreigner, because of the fact\nyou\u2019re from Britain and the way you can tell\nbecause you have English ways. So you can\u2019t\nwin you know?\u2019\nThe differences between a British-born Indian and\nan Indian-born Indian seemed based on lifestyle\ndifferences.  The predominantly western lifestyle of\nthe British-born respondents seemed to draw\nattention to their British identities.\nSports\n The context of sport played an important role in\nterms of the support or attachment that may be\nshown to a nation.  Respondents were asked\nquestions relating to cricket, football and the\nOlympics.\n Supporting England in football was regarded\nas a social event \u2013 something which brought the\nnation together.  But supporting England was also\nlinked to the idea of supporting a nation which\nprovided various opportunities that respondents\nmay not have received elsewhere. Some\nrespondents suggested that they supported the\nplayers and not the team, and so dissociated them-\nselves from any link to the nation itself.  A few\nrespondents mentioned supporting Britain because\nit represented the diversity of the country today.\nWithin the context of sport, there was also the\nidea of an alternative.  That is, when questioned as\nto why participants supported England in football,\nmany replied with \u2018because India\/Pakistan don\u2019t\nhave a team\u2019.  Supporting India or Pakistan in\nsports yielded responses such as supporting \u2018our\npeople\u2019 or the \u2018home country\u2019.  There was also a\nstrong influence of the family in cricket.\nRespondents would talk of their whole family\ngetting involved in matches and the feeling of pride\nthat emanated from their parents, which was also\nexperienced by the respondents themselves.  The\nfamily context seemed a strong influence in\naffirming their loyalty or support to India or Pakistan.\nRacism\n This category of racism can also be seen in\nterms of threat, but is also a major category within\nitself.  Experiences of racism were drawn upon by\nmany of the respondents. Many responses to rac-\nism highlighted the fact that these experiences\nbrought out feelings of a need to be accepted as\nBritish:\n\u2018We had a shop and we used to have people\ncome in there and say \u2018yeah you Paki\u2019 and I\u2019ll be\nlike \u2018well I just live in this country like you do,\nI\u2019m just as British as you!\u2019 and I\u2019d say that, I\nmean I was young, naive, and I was like 11, 12\nyears old and I would say \u2018yeah I\u2019m just as\nBritish as you\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ve lived here\u2019 and \u2018my mum\nand dad lived here\u2019 you know?\u2019.\nThis particular example from an Indian\nrespondent highlights how she began to feel\ndifferently about being British. When questioned\nfurther, she suggested that the volumes of people\ncoming to Britain justified white people\u2019s racist\nreactions.  Individuals would feel discriminated\nagainst, and want to be acknowledged as British,\nyet at the same time racists were seen to \u2018remind\nyou of who you are\u2019, and that they could never\nescape the fact that skin colour would always be\nthere to allow others reject them from the British\ncategory.\n Racism was not seen as a major issue anymore,\ndue to the current culturally diverse state of most\nurban areas, but also because the respondents\nrecognised that racists represented a small minority\nof people who were ignorant and narrow-minded.\nBoundaries of being British\nA model of the boundaries of being British can\nbe derived from the data. The boundaries described\nhere are comparable to Jacobson\u2019s (1997) civic,\nracial and cultural boundaries of Britishness.\nHowever, additional boundaries are also posited, as\nwell as some which may help to unravel the\ncomplex and problematic nature of some\nboundaries such as Jacobson\u2019s \u2018cultural\u2019 boundary.\nThe Racial Boundary\nThis exclusive boundary refers to a racial model\nof the nation. It encompasses only those with a\nwhite ancestry. In other words, for this category, to\nbe British is to be \u2018white\u2019.  This boundary appeared\nin respondents\u2019 feelings of exclusion of being\nBritish, based on their skin colour and racial\nbackground, which usually prompted questions\nsuch as \u2018where do you come from?\u2019.\nThe Historical Boundary\nAlthough this boundary was mentioned by only\ntwo respondents, it is nevertheless a very important\nboundary.  People may need a national, historical\nor even mythological story about the nation to be\nable to develop a national identity, or perhaps to\nhold a more emotional attachment to the nation.\nHowever, it is possible that these British Asian\nparticipants felt excluded from Britain\u2019s history. As\nstated by a male Indian respondent:\n\u2018I don\u2019t have any respect for British culture in\nthe sense that they tend not to acknowledge\nother countries, and historically they\u2019ve\ninvaded lots of other countries by force,\nincluding India, and forced their own traditions\non other people and shown disrespect to other\ncountries.\u2019\nIf identification with being British is based on\nhistorical bonds, or if such aspects are needed to\ncreate a sense of national identity, this, like the\nracial boundary is an exclusive category.  To\ndevelop a national identity with the idea of a\ncommon history excludes those groups for whom\nsuch an association is not possible. Commenting\non the first Indians that came to England, an Indian\nfemale participant argued that people fail to\nacknowledge their role in helping to develop and\nbuild Britain\u2019s economy and public services.  It\nseems that some British Asians feel excluded from\nthe nation because they have been excluded from\nthe culturally dominant representations of its history.\nThe Civic\/State Boundary\nThis boundary is based on citizenship, being\nborn in Britain and place of domicile only. The idea\nof being British stems only as far as acknowledging\nthese objective circumstances, as exemplified by\none female Pakistani respondent:\n\u2018I\u2019m just living here\u2026 I don\u2019t feel I have to\nchange to become an English person.\u2019\nIf this boundary is employed, then the individual\nconcerned does not feel any need to adopt any\naspect of the majority culture.  Such a boundary is\ninclusive as it is extended to all British passport\nholders, but it may also be regarded as allowing the\nsegregation of groups to exist.\nThe Instrumental Boundary\nThis boundary differs from the state boundary,\nas it regards the notion of Britishness as more than\njust the right to reside in Britain. Being British was\nevaluated along the dimensions of meeting legal,\npolitical, career and educational needs and\ninterests.\n \u2018To me personally, being British gives more\nbenefits than being known as a Pakistani. You\nknow you get free NHS, you get free medicine,\neyesights, and they\u2019re the advantages, free\neducation, and you don\u2019t get that in Pakistan.\nYou know those are the things that\u2019s bringing\npeople here, and they come here and want to be\nknown as British.\u2019\nWithin this category, there is more engagement\nwith, and participation in, the national group. For\nsome, it involved a comparative dimension between\nBritain and their parents\u2019 countries of origin, and a\nsense of pride derived from the fact that such\nopportunities allow them to benefit and achieve\nmore in their careers, education and financially.\nThe Lifestyle Boundary\nThis boundary concerns not only an integrative\naspect of a British identity, but also a banal aspect\nof their identity (Billig, 1995). These features termed\n\u2018lifestyle\u2019 are related to the modes of dress and\nspeech, the media influences and socialisation\npatterns that are everyday facets of the\nrespondents\u2019 lives.  Whilst many feel that their\nethnic identity is more prominent at home, they still\nfeel British in the way they dress, the way that many\ncontinue to speak English within the home, the\nmusic,     television and media choices they make,\nas well as the way they socialise, such as going to\nthe pub.\nIt could be argued that these aspects mentioned\nare \u2018Western\u2019 as opposed to \u2018British\u2019, but\nnevertheless they allow people to categorise\nthemselves as British. Perhaps in line with social\ncreativity strategies, the respondents may be using\nthese criteria of lifestyle as a comparative\ndimension which enables them to feel included\nwithin the British category.\nThe Multicultural Boundary\nThis boundary remains the broadest and most\ninclusive of all the boundaries.  It relates to the idea\nthat the cultural homogeneity of a national group is\nno longer necessary. This boundary allows all to be\nincluded within the category, whilst allowing the\nmaintenance of one\u2019s own values and beliefs\nespecially in the home. This boundary differs from\nthe lifestyle boundary because it focuses on a\nmulticultural conception of Britishness, and\nimportantly, it has significant implications for the\ncurrently changing content of British identity. When\ncommenting on how he felt about multiculturalism\nin Britain, an Indian respondent replied:\n\u2018I think it\u2019s good. You know, you got um, a lot of\ndiversity, it brings a lot of skills and culture. It is\nbringing culture to Britain. You know? It\u2019s like\nhow I was saying what is British culture? There\nis no British culture. British culture is about\ngetting pissed off your brain on the weekend\nand acting like an idiot, whereas the sort of\nmigrant\u2026 other people \u2013 Europeans, Indians,\nblacks, whatever, they bring a lot of culture to\nBritain.\u2019\nThe suggestion here, echoed by many other\nrespondents, was that being British implied a lack\nof culture, and it was multiculturalism and the\ndiversity associated with it that had brought culture\nto Britain.  The same respondent also said:\n\u2018\u2026society\u2019s become so multicultural that the\nEnglish terminology has just become ancient,\nyeah? It\u2019ll become one of those terms where\npeople used to be called \u2018English\u2019, but now it\u2019s\njust \u2018British\u2019.\u2019\nThe idea of a changing British identity means\nthat Englishness has been redefined in terms of the\nrural, while Britishness (at least within London) has\nbeen redefined in terms of ethnic super-diversity:\n\u2018Everything is so culturally diverse that you get\nlost in it, and you don\u2019t really know what it is,\nand it\u2019s only when you get thrown into it, like the\ncountry-bumpkin land, where there is a lot of\nEnglish people there, that you can really\nunderstand what Britishness is about or,\nBritishness now is completely changed, but\nwhat it was to be, or is to be British \u2013 the\nhumour, and the sarcasm, and all those things,\nand the way things are done.\nInterviewer- So what do you think Britishness is\nabout now?\n(Laughs!!) Politically correct!! Trying to be\npolitically correct all the time!! Everything... you\nknow, trying not to hurt anyone or offend\nanyone cos you might get sued, and it\u2019s all just\ngone completely a bit mad and crazy, but that\u2019s\nbecause there\u2019s so many different cultures\nhere, that you have to be so\u2026 what\u2019s the\nword?...you\u2019ve got to be very careful \u2026\nconsiderate to other people.\u2019\nMulticulturalism was seen by all the\nrespondents as something positive and good not\nonly  because it allowed those with various ethnic\nbackgrounds to be included, but also because it\nmay help to break down barriers of racism, by\nacknowledging the make-up of British cities and the\nacceptance of the cultural differences between\npeople. So this boundary is the most inclusive of all,\nas anyone can be a part of the British category.\nHowever, the idea of multiculturalism does not\nnecessarily mean a shared set of values or\nbeliefs among people. It simply means, in the\nliteral sense of the word, many cultures.\nAnother interesting issue revealed in the\ndata is the idea of new minorities. Asylum\nseekers, illegal immigrants and other ethnic\ngroups were talked about as being the new\ntargets of discrimination, as if to suggest that\nAsians were no longer low-status excluded\ngroups, and their inclusion in the wider British\nsociety meant that it was now the turn of these\nmigrant groups to gain acceptance in the\nnational group:\n\u2018The influence and acceptance of Indian\npeople in Britain is growing and will out\ngrow people\u2019s expectations and probably in\n50 years tie, they\u2019ll be much more widely\naccepted and racism will turn to other\ngroups like people from Kosovo and\nSomalians\u2026 it\u2019ll be the same thing that\nhappened to Indians 20 years ago\u2026 and with\nall this stuff on immigration\u2026 it\u2019ll be the\nsame situation but reversed\u2026 and by then\nthe Asians will be a lot more accepted\u2026\u2019\nIn comparison to Jacobson\u2019s (1997)\nboundaries of Britishness, these boundaries\nshow a progression of newer conceptions of\nBritishness, and suggest that her original three\nboundaries were an over-simplification of what\nit means to be British from the perspective of\nethnic minorities. Although these findings\ncannot necessarily be generalised to all British\nIndian and Pakistanis, it does reflect their\nawareness of political, racial and cultural\naspects of being British. Unlike Jacobson\u2019s\ncultural boundary, which lacks clear definition of\nwhat this boundary might include, there are\nclear distinctions which emerge form the\npresent study between instrumental, lifestyle\nand multicultural definitions of being British.\nReferences\nBallard, R.
