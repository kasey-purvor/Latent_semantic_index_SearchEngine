Here they\nare treated as hypotheses, to be tested against the results of a detailed survey of King\u2019s Lynn, a town of about\n41 000 people in eastern England. During 1999\u20132004 the flora was enumerated in twenty-five 1-km squares,\narranged in a square of side 5 km. The species total for King\u2019s Lynn was 151, with an average of 42 species per\n1-km square. We compared the flora of the town with that of the East Anglian region, from which 345 species\nhave been recorded. Frequency of species in 1-km squares of King\u2019s Lynn was strongly related to frequency in\n5-km squares in East Anglia. The King\u2019s Lynn flora was, for the region, exceptionally species-rich, with more\ncalcifuges and fewer epiphytes than would be expected from the regional average. In the 1-km square\ncontaining the town centre, 28 species were recorded, of which Bryum caespiticium, Ceratodon purpureus,\nFunaria hygrometrica and Marchantia polymorpha were more frequent in the town than in the wider\ncountryside.\nKEYWORDS: Biogeography, bryophyte attributes, East Anglia, Ellenberg values, floristics.\nINTRODUCTION\nUrban areas are difficult to define, and there is no general\nagreement amongst geographers; criteria employed include\nfunction, structure and population size. The UNESCO\n(1973) definition, i.e. any settlement with a population of\nover 20 000, is that adopted here. Such settlements range\nfrom vast industrial agglomerations, with or without\nsatanic mills, through to small market towns in rural\nsettings. However, they are all dynamic entities, responding\nto social and economic pressures and to the changing\nwhims and fashions of planners and politicians.\nNonetheless, certain fundamental land use types are\ncommon to most urban areas in the developed world and\nsome of these (e.g. city centre; suburban; industrial;\nrecreational, etc.) have been used as recording units in\nstudies of urban bryophytes.\nIn terms of habitat diversity for bryophytes, towns all\nhave one thing in common - an abundance of \u2018rock\u2019\nsurfaces open for colonisation, be they brick, concrete or\nstone. They may also possess water bodies, parks, gardens,\nand areas of woodland which may offer more \u2018natural\u2019\nhabitats. All of these will, however, be influenced by local\ngeology, soils, climate, and the existence \u2013 whether\ncurrently or formerly \u2013 of pollution. Urban areas can,\ntherefore, offer either diversity or poverty of habitat.\nAlthough the majority of bryologists in Britain probably\nlive in urban areas there are few accounts of urban\nbryophytes in the U.K., except those by Gilbert (1968,\n1971). These studies, conducted in Newcastle-upon-Tyne,\nestablished that the bryofloras at that period were greatly\naffected by SO2. Gilbert was able to demonstrate that\ndifferent bryophyte communities could be correlated with\naccurately determined levels of SO2. He established two\nprinciples: (1) that as pollution levels increased, the\ndiversity of the bryoflora on the substrates he had specified\nin his study decreased; and (2) that specific bryophytes\ncould be used as indicators of particular levels of pollution.\nAt the time of Gilbert\u2019s work there was much interest in\nbio-monitoring, and numerous other studies confirmed the\nprinciple that pollution had an adverse effect on bryo-\nphytes. Burton (1990) provides a summary of information\non the topic. Subsequently, bryophyte populations have\nshown considerable signs of recovery as a result of reduced\natmospheric pollution (Bates, Bell & Farmer, 1990; Adams\n& Preston, 1992).\nThere have been many studies of urban bryophytes in\nEurope, e.g. Schaepe (1986); Carcano (1989); Cortini\nJournal of Bryology (2008) 30: 12\u201322\n# British Bryological Society 2008 Received 19 September 2007. Revision accepted 7 November 2007\nDOI: 10.1179\/174328208X282111\nPedrotti (1989); Lo Giudice (1992); Fudali (1994, 1996,\n1998); Vanderpoorten (1997). From these, some general-\nizations regarding urban bryofloras have been proposed\n(Table 1). A recent survey of the bryophytes of King\u2019s Lynn\nhas been used to test them.\nLOCATION OF STUDY\nSite and situation\nKing\u2019s Lynn is a market town in eastern England. It is\nsituated on the eastern bank of the River Great Ouse, 4 km\ninland from the Wash (Fig. 1). The Gaywood river and\nwater from the Middleton Stop Drain both flow through\nthe town, though their courses have been much altered and\nintegrated with a complex pattern of internal drainage\nchannels. The river Nar at one time formed the southern\nboundary of the town. To the north, the land is largely\narable and consists of reclaimed salt marsh. The site is low-\nlying with little topographic variation; in the northwest of\nthe study area the ground rises to a maximum height of\n35 m before dropping into the Gaywood valley, which is\nseparated from the low ground associated with the\nMiddleton Stop Drain by a slight ridge. A satellite\nsettlement, West Lynn, lies on the opposite bank of the\nGreat Ouse.\nClimate, geology and soils\nKing\u2019s Lynn, in common with the rest of East Anglia, has\na temperate oceanic climate. January and July mean\ntemperatures are 3.3 and 16.0uC; annual precipitation is\n620 mm (Barrow, Hulme & Jiang, 1993).\nThe soils in the lower lying parts of the town are based on\nsilts and clays of marine and alluvial origin. The ground\nrises to the east, where the underlying rocks are acidic lower\nCretaceous sands. However this simple picture is compli-\ncated by the presence of calcareous tills (\u2018chalky boulder\nclay\u2019 of Anglian [Elsterian] age), and fluvio-glacial sands in\nplaces; organic peat soils are locally present in the\nGaywood valley. As a result, soil conditions can vary quite\nwidely, even over short distances.\nGilbert (1989) describes the characteristics of urban soils.\nMan-made and top-soiled sites exist mainly in gardens,\nallotments and public open spaces, such as parks. However,\nthe practice of putting down top-soil in gardens is relatively\nrecent; in older gardens the soil is that which was available\non site. Raw lithomorphic soils of various types also occur,\nthough sparingly. In waste areas brick rubble may occur;\nbasic furnace slag is mainly found along railway lines, along\nwith ballast made from acid igneous rocks. Chemical wastes\nare found at a former industrial site in South Lynn, whilst\nsubsoils are exposed on steep banks such as the sides of\ndykes. Hard surfaces, such as tarmac, paved areas, roads\nand concrete, are widely present.\nHistory\nDuring medieval times King\u2019s Lynn was an important port.\nIt then went into a period of relative decline, and only\nbegan to expand again slowly during the 18th and 19th\ncenturies. In the 1930s ribbon development began to take\nTable 1. The main generalisations made regarding the nature of urban bryofloras.\nHypotheses about urban bryofloras Tests References\n1. Impoverishment.

Large-scale\nexpansion occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, when Lynn\nacted as an \u2018overspill\u2019 town, attracting many newcomers\nfrom London. Modern housing estates, both private and\npublic, were built, usually encroaching onto previously\nagricultural or rural land. Several relics of older land uses\nsuch as orchards survive as small enclaves of waste\/derelict\nland. At the time of the national census of 2001, the town\nhad a population of 41 000.\nBryophyte recording\nThere are no previous accounts of the bryology of King\u2019s\nLynn. Published records covering the whole of Norfolk\n(Petch & Swann, 1968; Swann, 1975, 1982; Beckett, Bull &\nStevenson 1999) make occasional reference to King\u2019s Lynn\nand environs, but lack precise details of localities. These\nsources have therefore been ignored. Nor has any attempt\nbeen made to trace records in local or national herbaria as\nthey are unlikely to contain many species from the town.\nPayne (1995) has published an account of the vascular\nplants of the town, though he limited his study to plants\nfound within the boundaries of the former medieval town.\nRegional data for comparison\nTo test hypotheses about urban bryophytes, we needed a\ncontrol dataset from non-urban sites in the vicinity. No\nother data had been collected in East Anglia at 1-km\nresolution, but we had access to two substantial datasets,\none collected at 5-km resolution and the other with partial\ncoverage at 2-km resolution. A third, small dataset was at\n10-km resolution. This consisted of species lists for the grid\nsquares TF50, TF51, TF52, TF60, TF63, TF64, TF70,\nTF71, TF72, TF73 and TF74, which are very close to\nKing\u2019s Lynn but do not include the study area. The dataset\nat 5-km resolution is for Cambridgeshire, which has been\nresurveyed since 2000 by the Cambridgeshire Bryological\nRecording Group. In total, 89 squares have at least 50%\nof their area in the vice-county of Cambridgeshire,\nwhich comprises the administrative districts of South\nCambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely. The 5-km squares\nwere divided into \u2018North Cambs\u2019, the 44 squares north of\nthe Ordnance Survey northing 270 000, and \u2018South Cambs\u2019,\nthe 45 squares south of it.\nThe other large regional dataset was from Suffolk, the\nEast Anglian county south of Norfolk. This had been\nsurveyed in 2-km squares (\u2018tetrads\u2019) by Richard Fisk. To\nFigure 1. King\u2019s Lynn, showing rivers and selected landcover types, including ancient woodland (hatched) and unwooded rural land\n(stippled); the grid lines are spaced at intervals of 1 km.\n14 C. ROBIN STEVENSON AND MARK O. HILL\nget a dataset with similar resolution to that from\nCambridgeshire, records were amalgamated from the six\nsurveyed tetrads nearest the southwestern corner of each\n10-km square (\u2018hectads\u2019). These made up a total of 24 km2,\nwhich is very similar to the 25 km2 recorded in\nCambridgeshire. (A check was made to find out whether\nspecies totals from hectads where the tetrads were\nconcentrated in the southwestern corner were smaller than\ntotals from hectads where the tetrads were more widely\nscattered. No difference was found, so the sample was\ntaken to be homogeneous.)\nMETHODOLOGY\nSurvey methodology\nTwenty-five of the 1-km squares of the British National\nGrid, arranged in a 565 km block, were used as a basis for\nrecording. This choice was based on convenience. The main\npurposes were to document the bryophytes of an urban\narea and to establish a baseline against which future\nchanges might be measured. Extending the survey beyond\nthese limits was not deemed necessary, even though parts of\nthe town do lie outside the study area. (The characteristics\nof the squares used, and their co-ordinates, are tabulated in\nsupplementary material.)\nSome of the squares used in the survey are wholly\nurban; some are almost wholly agricultural. Many\nshow intermediate characteristics: urban parks and\nwaste land may provide semi-natural habitats, even in\nthe heart of town. The reason why the suburbs and\nsurrounding fringes have been recorded is that these are\nthe areas which will probably show the greatest changes\nin future, as Lynn expands and land use changes. It\nmay be their fate to become fragments of \u2018encapsulated\ncountryside\u2019.\nEach square was visited on a number of occasions,\ndepending on the number of habitats present. Squares with\ncomplex land uses (for example woodland, industrial and\nresidential areas) took longer to record than purely arable\nareas. Surveying was repeated until no new species were\nbeing found. Some habitats such as gardens or roofs, which\nare difficult of access, were sampled less rigorously than\nothers.\nInitially recording was based on a series of land use types\nand habitats within them, until it was realised that the\nsystem was unnecessarily complicated. A bryophyte is not\ngoing to differentiate between a school playing field, a\ngarden lawn and the greensward in a park. Similarly, a\nbrick, stone, or concrete wall is much the same, whether it is\nholding up a house, a factory, or merely acting as a\nproperty divide.\nFor the analysis, 1-km squares were classified in three\ntypes, urban, mixed and rural. These categories, originally\ndefined from maps, were compared with the Land Cover\nMap of Great Britain (LCMGB), based on satellite\nimages (Fuller, Groom & Jones, 1994). The Land Cover\nMap recognizes two predominantly urban categories,\nurban and suburban. These were added together to obtain\na combined urban cover. Squares classified as urban had\nat least 40% combined urban land cover. Mixed squares\nhad 20\u201339% combined urban land cover, and rural squares\nhad 0\u201319%.\nBryophyte attributes\nSpecies attributes, including taxonomic order, frequency in\nGreat Britain (out of 2789 hectads with at least 1 ha of\nland), climatic preferences, habitat indicator values, sub-\nstrate preferences, life form and life history, were taken\nfrom BRYOATT (Hill et al., 2007). Habitat indicator\nvalues include \u2018Ellenberg values\u2019 for Light (L), Moisture\n(M), Reaction (R), Nitrogen (N) and Salt (S), together with\na newly-compiled indicator of heavy-metal tolerance.\nSubstrate preferences were used to produce a list of\n\u2018obligate epiphytes\u2019 \u2013 species restricted to wood as a\nsubstrate. This included four species for which hard rock\nis also indicated as a substrate in BRYOATT. As hard rock\n(as opposed to worked rock, including brickwork, slates\nand masonry) is almost totally unavailable as a substrate in\nEast Anglia, we have treated these species as obligate\nepiphytes in the region. Annuality is defined as 0 for a\nperennial, 100 for an annual, and 33 and 67 for the two\nintermediate categories.\nStatistical analysis\nFrequencies of occurrence in the 25 1-km squares of King\u2019s\nLynn were related to those in the 146 5-km squares of the\nEast Anglian region by means of logistic regression.\nSpecifically, let\nx~number of occurrences out of 146 in the region (1)\ny~number of occurrences out of 25 in King\n;\ns Lynn (2)\nEmpirical logits (Cox & Snell, 1981) are defined as\nX~ln\u00bd(xz0:5)=(146:5{x)\u0001 (3)\nY~ln\u00bd(yz0:5)=(25:5{y)\u0001 (4)\nValues of Y were used for plotting the relationship but were\nnot used further in the analysis. Let p be the probability of a\nspecies being found in a 1-km square of King\u2019s Lynn.\nEstimates of p were obtained by logistic regression using the\nsoftware package MinitabTM Release 13.20, fitting para-\nmeters a and b to give the best fit to observed values of y\nassuming the relationship\nlogit(p)~ln\u00bdp=(1{p)\u0001~azbX (5)\nNote that the logit in equation (5) is the true logit and not\nthe empirical logit used in equation (4).\nExpected and observed frequencies were compared, both\nfor individual species and for categories of species. For\nRESULTS OF A BRYOLOGICAL SURVEY OF KING\u2019S LYNN 15\nindividual species, the significance of differences between\nobserved and calculated numbers of occurrences was tested\nwith an exact two-tailed test, assuming that occurrences\nin 1-km squares were independent random events. For\ncategories of species such as epiphytes, occurrences in 1-km\nsquares were added across all species in the category and\ntested using the normal approximation to the Poisson\ndistribution. Specifically, let y be the observed number of\noccurrences and y\u02c6 be the estimated number using the\nmodel. Then the test statistic z was\nz~(y{y^)=y^\n1=2\n(6)\nRESULTS\nSpecies richness\nIn total, 151 bryophytes (134 mosses, 17 liverworts) were\nrecorded in King\u2019s Lynn. This compares with 383 species\nfound in the county of Norfolk since 1950 and 345 species\nfound in the 146 squares (mostly 5-km squares) used for\nregional comparison. The study area contained more\nspecies than any of the comparison squares in\nCambridgeshire and Suffolk, and more than all but one\nof the 10-km squares in the vicinity (Table 2). There was no\nevidence that the more urban 1-km squares were species-\npoor. The mean count of species for the 12 most urban\nsquares was 43; that for the 5 most rural squares was 29.\nThe mean for the 8 mixed squares was 49. Differences\nbetween counts for these categories were, however, not\nstatistically significant.\nDistinctive nature\nIn the regional analysis (Table 3) the fenland area of North\nCambridgeshire differed markedly in mean Ellenberg\nvalues for light, moisture, reaction and fertility.\nSpecifically, the fens appear to be lighter, drier, less acid\nand more fertile than the King\u2019s Lynn study area. These\ndifferences reflect the open, fertile countryside of the fens.\nAlthough there is wet ground along drains and in washes\n(land retained to receive floodwater), these habitats do not\nsupport enough bryophyte species to counteract the\ngenerally dry profile of drained fields and farm buildings.\nSouth Cambridgeshire was significantly less acid than the\nstudy area but otherwise similar. Cambridgeshire is perhaps\nthe most uniformly calcareous county in Britain.\nIn the analysis of 1-km squares in King\u2019s Lynn (Table 4),\ndifferences between categories were nearly but not quite\nsignificant when the land cover categories (urban, mixed\nand rural) are considered. By contrast, all differences\nbetween the town centre and squares with ancient wood-\nland were significant (p,0.05), except that for light, which\nwas nearly significant (p,0.10). The difference for salt was\nalso significant, but the elevated value in the centre was due\nto the presence of only four species, namely Amblystegium\nserpens (S52), Ceratodon purpureus (S51), Eurhynchium\npraelongum (S51) and Hennediella heimii (S55). The\ngeneral relation between the combined Ellenberg values\nand species richness (Fig. 2) shows that squares in the\ntown centre and completely rural squares were the most\nspecies-poor, while the three squares with ancient wood-\nland were the most species-rich.

This reflects the fact\nthat the commoner species tend to have high indicator\nvalues for light, reaction and fertility, and low moisture\nvalues.\nToxitolerance\nThere was no difference in the profiles of heavy metal\ntolerance between King\u2019s Lynn and comparison areas\n(Table 3). The mean heavy-metal tolerance of bryophytes\nin the 1-km square at the town centre was 0.71, almost\nexactly equal to the mean for the 24 other 1-km squares in\nthe town, also 0.71.\nLife-forms and annuality\nAnnuality varied markedly between areas (Table 5), with\na mean standard deviation of 5.0 for variation between\n25 km2 sample areas within regions. On this basis, North\nCambridgeshire stands out again, its bryophytes being\nsignificantly more annual than those of the other areas\n(p50.02 for King\u2019s Lynn vicinity and p,0.001 for South\nCambridgeshire). The study area, being based on a single\nsample was not significantly different from the other\nareas. The balance of life-forms was broadly similar for the\nstudy area and Suffolk, but again North Cambridgeshire\nwas markedly different, having a preponderance of\ncushions and tufts (acrocarps) and a relatively low\nnumber of mats and wefts (pleurocarps). The rarer life-\nforms were exceptionally poorly represented in North\nCambridgeshire.\nThere was greater variation between the 1-km squares of\nthe study area. In particular, the five rural squares had\nhigh annuality, averaging 16.6. In one largely arable\nsquare (National Grid reference TF6222) in the northwest\nof the study area, annuality was 23.0, compared with 8.3\nfor the town centre and 8.0 for the three squares\ncontaining ancient woods. In this predominantly arable\nsquare, turfs were by a wide margin the dominant life-\nform. Cushions and tufts were most frequent in the urban\nsquares, especially the town centre. Mats and wefts, on the\nother hand, were especially frequent in the squares with\nancient woodland.\nTaxonomic bias\nThe balance of bryophyte orders in the study area\nresembles that for Suffolk (Table 6). North\nCambridgeshire is notable for its very low representation\nof leafy liverworts and Polytrichales. Within King\u2019s Lynn,\nHypnales were high in ancient woods, Pottiales were\nrelatively high in the town centre, and Bryales were\nrelatively high in the rural squares. Dicranales,\nOrthotrichales, Polytrichales and leafy liverworts were\nlow or missing in the town centre.\nGeographical bias\nOn average, the species recorded in 1-km squares were more\nfrequent in Great Britain than those in larger squares\n(Table 7).

Among the larger sampling units, species from the\nKing\u2019s Lynn study area were on average the least frequent\n(1204 hectads), while those in North Cambridgeshire were\nthe most frequent (1431 hectads).\nClimatic differences in the profiles of species were small.\nThe mean climate profile of species in the town centre was\nalmost identical to that of those in the rural squares. There\nis a suggestion that species of squares with ancient woods\nhave a slightly wetter and cooler profile than those of the\ntown centre or open country.\nKing\u2019s Lynn flora in its regional context\nThe commonest species in King\u2019s Lynn were Amblystegium\nserpens, Barbula convoluta, B. unguiculata, Brachythecium\nrutabulum, Bryum argenteum, B. bicolor, B. capillare,\nCeratodon purpureus, Eurhynchium praelongum, Funaria\nhygrometrica, Grimmia pulvinata, Orthotrichum diaphanum,\nRhynchostegium confertum and Tortula muralis. These\nspecies are all frequent in eastern England, and could be\nexpected in almost any large village or farm. Indeed, the\ncomparison between frequency in King\u2019s Lynn and\nfrequency in East Anglia (Fig. 3) shows a stronger relation-\nship between frequency in 5-km squares in East Anglia than\nthat in 1-km squares of the study area.\nThe parameters a and b were estimated as a521.283,\nb50.983. These values provide an exact fit to the mean species\nrichness in 1-km squares, 42.1 species per square. However,\nthey clearly refute the assumption that species occur in King\u2019s\nLynn as a random subsample of those in the wider country-\nside. The assumption of randomness predicts that 178 species\nwould be found in the survey, whereas in fact 151 were found.\nThe difference is only just significant (p50.05) but the nature\nof the discrepancies (Table 8) makes it clear that there was\nclustering of some regionally uncommon species. At the 5%\nlevel of probability (two-tailed) there were 10 species that were\nsignificantly less frequent than would be expected, and 21\nspecies that were significantly more frequent. Of these, the\nmost extreme was Hennediella macrophylla, which had only\nan 18% chance of being found in the town at all, but which\nactually occurred in 6 squares.\nTable 6.

ROBIN STEVENSON AND MARK O. HILL\nDISCUSSION\nStatistical analysis\nSignificance tests were based on the assumption that\noccurrences of species either in the town of King\u2019s Lynn or\nin the wider East Anglian region are random events. This\nassumption is undoubtedly false. Species occurrences are well\nknown to be clustered at all scales, both because plants often\ncolonize new sites close to existing ones and because suitable\nhabitats tend to be clustered together in the countryside. The\npurpose of testing hypotheses against the random case is to\nestablish whether there is even prima facie evidence of\ndifferences. For contributing to general understanding,\ncomparisons between sites do not have to be significant to be\nworth considering. For example, King\u2019s Lynn has only a single\ntown centre, so that differences between the town centre and\nother squares are unlikely to be significant in a sample of 25.\nThe analysis to determine how far occurrences within\nKing\u2019s Lynn reflect regional frequency was intended to be\nmore rigorous. The logistic model was fitted formally, and\ntests for whether individual species or groups of species were\nsignificantly over- or under-represented were exact, given the\nassumption of random occurrence. Hennediella macrophylla\nclearly refutes the hypothesis of randomness. In the event,\nthe number of species for which the assumption breaks down\nis not great, so that deviations ought to be capable of\nexplanation. H. macrophylla is a neophyte in Britain, and is\nno doubt highly clustered because it is still spreading.\nFigure 3.

It is well known that some species\noccur with local distributions more clumped than others\n(Kunin, 1998; Pearman, 1997), and that because of this, no\nuniform process of scaling down can be wholly reliable.\nIn spite of these difficulties, the relationship between\nregional frequency in 5-km squares and local frequency in\n1-km squares was remarkably good. Information on\nclumping of bryophytes is for the most part lacking, so\nthat there is some inevitable uncertainty about comparisons\nbetween frequencies at the 1-km and 5-km square scales. It\nis encouraging that Hennediella macrophylla showed up as\nhaving a strongly clumped distribution. We believe our\nresults are robust, but admit that additional sampling from\nother locations at 1-km square resolution is needed to\nestablish scaling relationships in bryophytes.\nSpecies richness and composition\nThe King\u2019s Lynn flora is not impoverished. Indeed, it is\nexceptionally rich. Part of the high richness may be due to\nmore intensive recording, in King\u2019s Lynn than in other\nparts of East Anglia. Some of the richness is due to the\npresence of ancient woodland within the town limits\n(Fig. 2). However, even without the ancient woods, the\nKing\u2019s Lynn total is 127 species; the woods add only 24\nextra species. The theory that urban areas are impoverished\nis refuted for King\u2019s Lynn. A similarly rich flora was found\nin Trento, northern Italy, where 136 species were recorded\nin an area of 4.5 km2 (Pokorny, Lara & Mazimpaka, 2006).\nHowever, the 1-km square at the centre of King\u2019s Lynn had\na poor flora, with only 28 species. Even the centre of\nLondon does not appear to be especially species-poor, with\n78 species recorded in the Biological Records Centre\ndatabase post 1969 in 10-km square TQ28; but this too\ncontains encapsulated countryside.\nIt is clear from the regional analysis (Fig. 3) that for most\nspecies, the regional frequency is a good predictor of\nfrequency in King\u2019s Lynn. Epiphytes were less frequent\nthan would be expected by chance, but not significantly so.\nHowever, the 21 obligate epiphytes (in the sense of Bates\net al. (1997), i.e. species with only living wood as a normal\nsubstrate according to BRYOATT (Hill et al., 2007) had a\ntotal occurrence summed over all squares of 23, whereas\n48.5 would be predicted. This discrepancy is highly\nsignificant and confirms the impression derived from\nFig. 3 that epiphyte frequency in King\u2019s Lynn is low in\nrelation to regional frequency. Hypnum cupressiforme,\nOrthotrichum affine and Zygodon viridissimus (only O.\naffine is an obligate epiphyte), had individually significant\nlow frequency values (Table 8), but when the group is taken\ntogether, the effect is clear. Note that many of the trees\ncommonly planted in urban areas, such as London plane\nPlatanus6hispanica, conifers and ornamental cherries\n(Prunus spp.) are typically poor in obligate epiphytes, even\nwhen planted in the country.\nOf the other species that were significantly rare or absent,\nDidymodon luridus, D. sinuosus, Pseudocrossidium revolutum\nand Rhynchostegiella tenella are calcicoles often found on\nsheltered masonry. Their absence from King\u2019s Lynn reflects\nthe fact the local building stone is non-calcareous, with\nlimestone used only in a few old churches and churchyards,\nwhich have been tidied-up to the detriment of bryophytes.\nLikewise, Syntrichia intermedia is a calcicole of dry roofs\nand masonry. The relative scarcity of Bryum klinggraeffii\nand B. violaceum is because these two ephemerals are most\ncharacteristic of arable fields, a habitat poorly represented\nin urban areas and in the King\u2019s Lynn study area.\nTwenty-one species were significantly more common\nthan would be predicted from regional frequency (Table 8).\nFour of these, Bryum caespiticium, Ceratodon purpureus,\nFunaria hygrometrica and Marchantia polymorpha are\nindeed distinctively urban; all occur in the centre of\nKing\u2019s Lynn. Nine of the remainder are calcifuges, which\nin East Anglia are either rare (Dicranella cerviculata,\nPseudotaxiphyllum elegans, Tetraphis pellucida) or occa-\nsional (Atrichum undulatum, Ditrichum cylindricum,\nFissidens exilis, Mnium hornum, Orthodontium lineare,\nPlagiothecium succulentum). Hennediella macrophylla is\npresumably a fairly new introduction. Aneura pinguis,\nDidymodon tophaceus, Fissidens incurvus, Tortula modica\nand Physcomitrium pyriforme are found either on clay\nbanks of the numerous dykes that cut through the town or\non mud banked on their sides when they are cleaned out.\nHypnum resupinatum may well have been under-recorded in\nthe region because it is doubtfully distinct from H.\ncupressiforme. We have no explanation of why\nBrachythecium velutinum should be especially frequent in\nthe town.\nThe representation of taxonomic orders generally follows\nthe regional trend. Of the larger orders, Sphagnales and\nOrthotrichales are significantly under-represented, reflect-\ning the effects of drainage and the lack of obligate\nepiphytes, and Dicranales are over-represented in spite of\nbeing under-represented in the town centre.\nEcological attributes of the flora\nAlthough the flora of King\u2019s Lynn closely reflects that of\nthe East Anglian region, there are some distinctive features.\nThe low occurrence of obligate epiphytes, which are less\nthan half as frequent as would be expected, is notable.\nAnother notable feature is the high number of calcifuges,\n20 C. ROBIN STEVENSON AND MARK O. HILL\nwith 279 occurrences of species with Ellenberg R less than\n6, where 229 would be expected (p50.001). There is a\ncorresponding deficit of calcicoles, with 494 occurrences of\nspecies with R greater than 7 where 542 would be expected\n(p50.05). This reflects the local geology and soils.\nWhen the flora was analysed by substrate preference\n(from BRYOATT; Hill et al., 2007), species characteristic of\nsoil, peat, gravel and sand, and dead wood were signifi-\ncantly more frequent than would be expected by chance.\nThe discrepancies for substrates other than peat were not\nvery large, being in the range 11\u201314%. They may\nconceivably be due to comparing 1-km squares with 5-km\nsquares. We have no way of knowing this without an\nintensively-sampled set of rural 1-km squares for compar-\nison. The discrepancy for peat was, however, 40% (140\noccurrences of peat-substrate species when 100 would be\nexpected). Peat is locally scarce as a substrate, and the high\noccurrence of species in this group reflects the fact that they\ncan also occur on the acid sandy soils with deep leaf litter to\nthe north of the town.\nThere was also a nearly-significant (p50.055) difference\nbetween the number of occurrences of the weft life-form\nand the number expected (59 observed, 76 expected). Weft\nformers tend to be large mosses and liverworts of long-\nestablished woodland and grassland, and although\nCalliergonella cuspidata and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus\nare common enough in the urban environment, others\nsuch as Cirriphyllum piliferum, Eurhynchium striatum,\nHomalothecium lutescens, Pleurozium schreberi,\nRhytidiadelphus triquetrus, Scleropodium purum and\nThuidium tamariscinum are distinctly under-represented in\nKing\u2019s Lynn.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe hypotheses of impoverishment, toxitolerance and\nthermophilic tendency are not true for King\u2019s Lynn. In\ngeneral, the King\u2019s Lynn flora is not distinctive, with\nfrequencies in 1-km squares being well predicted by\nregional frequency in East Anglia. However, Bryum\ncaespiticium, Ceratodon purpureus, Funaria hygrometrica\nand Marchantia polymorpha appear to be commoner in\nurban King\u2019s Lynn than their admittedly widespread\noccurrence elsewhere would indicate. In the other direction,\nobligate epiphytes and weft-forming bryophytes of wood-\nland were less frequent in King\u2019s Lynn than would be\nexpected from their regional frequency. With this minor\nproviso, there was no evidence that colonists were at a\nspecial advantage. In the town centre, Pottiales were over-\nrepresented, whereas Dicranales and Orthotrichales\nwere under-represented. Calcifuge species, including\nPolytrichales, were more frequent in King\u2019s Lynn than in\nthe East Anglian region, reflecting the local geology and\nsoils.\nWhile some of these results are specific to King\u2019s Lynn,\nothers are clearly more general. To understand the broader\npicture, we need comparable studies both from large cities\nand from some rural areas.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nFriends, colleagues, and total strangers have allowed access\nto their land and gardens, the latter largely through the\ngood offices of Frances Schumann.
