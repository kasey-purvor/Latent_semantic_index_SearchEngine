However, in the context of AIDS and poverty, \ncommunities are increasingly stretched, compromising the quality of care \navailable to children affected by AIDS. This calls for an understanding of the \nprocesses that best facilitate the capacity of communities to provide good \nquality care and support. In the interests of furthering debate and practice in \nthis area, we seek to develop an analytical framework that builds on two inter-\nlinked strands. Firstly, we emphasise the need to acknowledge the active \ncoping and resilience of children affected by AIDS, rather than seeing them as \npassive victims. It is through taking account of children\u2019s and communities\u2019 \nindigenous coping strategies, and the complex dynamics between children and \nfostering families, that interventions have the best chance of supporting \ncommunities so that they can best facilitate resilience and well-being of AIDS-\naffected children under their guardianship. Secondly, we highlight six \npsychosocial resources that we argue should be promoted in communities to \nimprove the quality of support available to children affected by AIDS, and \nthereby enhance the coping and resilience of children.  \n \n \n \nIntroduction \nIn sub-Saharan Africa, 12 million children under the age of 18 have lost one or both parents to AIDS, \nand nearly 2 million children under the age of 14 are HIV positive (UNICEF, UNAIDS, WHO, & \nUNFPA, 2008). Millions more have been made vulnerable by AIDS-related poverty and other illness-\nassociated stressors such as caregiving (Robson, Ansell, Huber, Gould, & van Blerk, 2006). \nReference is often made to the \u2018orphan-care crisis\u2019 (e.g. Guest, 2001; Howard, Phillips, Matinhure, \nGoodman, McCurdy, & Johnson, 2006) \u2013 typecasting orphans as a problem. However, whilst the \nstatistics are alarming and reflect the immense scale of the AIDS epidemic, a remarkable 90% of \nchildren affected by HIV and AIDS are estimated to be in the care and  support of extended family \nmembers (Monasch & Boerma, 2004; UNICEF, 2003). This situation runs counter to the current \n                                               \n1 Institute of Social Psychology, London School of Economics & Political Science m.skovdal@lse.ac.uk  \n \n2 Institute of Social Psychology, London School of Economics & Political Science \n \nPart of the \nFirelight Foundation \nSpecial issue \n \nAccepted: \n20 August 2009 \n \nAvailable online: \nDecember 1 2009 \n \n \nKey words:  \nOrphans \nCommunity Support \nCoping  \nResilience \nAIDS  \nAfrica  \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 2 \nstereotype of an \u2018orphan care crisis\u2019, and the frequently-made assertions that the \u2018traditional systems \nof family support\u2019 are breaking down (George, Oudenhoven, & Wazir, 2003:344; Guest, 2001). \n \nAlthough extended-family networks continue to assume the primary role in orphan care and support, \nan increasing number of reports highlight the hardship experienced by fostering households in \nsecuring children\u2019s basic needs, including schooling, food and medical care (Nyambedha, \nWandibba, & Aagaard-Hansen, 2003b; Oleke, Blystad, & Rekdal, 2005; Oni, 1995; Ssengonzi, \n2009). Such struggles highlight the strain which many fostering households endure and underline \nthe fact that neither the public sector nor communities are currently providing adequate support to \nthe growing number of fostering households (Miller, Gruskin, Subramanian, Rajaraman, & Heymann, \n2006).  \n \nThere is an urgent need to earmark funds for orphan care and support. However, in agreement with \nFoster (2002), we believe that such funds will do most good if they target existing support strategies \nand psychosocial resources. This implies a need to understand, identify and strengthen latent and \nexisting grassroots resources. Following on from this, Foster (2002) also argues that traditional \nfostering systems, if supported by community initiatives, will continue to meet most of these \nchildren\u2019s basic needs. His argument arises from the demonstrated ability of community-based \norphan support initiatives to target and support large numbers of fostering households in sub-\nSaharan Africa (Drew, Makufa, & Foster, 1998; Foster, Makufa, Drew, Kambeu, & Saurombe, 1996; \nNyamukapa & Gregson, 2005; Skovdal, Mwasiaji, Morrison, & Tomkins, 2008). Highlighting the \nviability of strengthening and supporting community initiatives, Nyambedha and Aagaard-Hansen \n(2007) have observed a renewed community solidarity in some settings of Kenya as a result of the \nAIDS epidemic, with local self-help and volunteer groups emerging in an effort to support the many \nchildren affected by AIDS. \n \nWhilst non-governmental organisations (NGO) play a key role in facilitating community-based \norphan support initiatives, it has been noted that \u201cfew agencies trust communities to make important \ndecisions about the use of external grants\u201d (Foster, 2002:1909). Reconciling local (community) and \nexternal (NGO) responses to orphan care remains a challenge and there is a growing concern that \nwell-intentioned NGOs may inadvertently be undermining local efforts to cope with the epidemic. \nDrawing on their experience in Rwanda, Thurman, Snider, et al. (2008) argue that ill-conceived NGO \nservices can fragment local community responses by taking over the perceived responsibility for \ncare of children affected by AIDS. NGOs are also often guided by representations of orphans as \nvulnerable, poorly behaved and \u2018at risk\u2019 of poor mental health, representations that might not \ncorrespond with local understandings of orphanhood (Meintjes & Giese, 2006). This can lead to what \nlocal communities perceive as the unfair targeting of a single group of children (those affected by \nAIDS) by agencies. It is precisely such a context that can fragment local support networks and cause \nfurther marginalisation of children affected by AIDS (Meintjes & Giese, 2006; Thurman et al., 2008).  \n \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 3 \nSuch inappropriate responses are often driven by the assumptions that (i) orphans are passive \nrecipients of support, and (ii) outside agencies have the solution and that an externally imposed \nintervention is an appropriate way to tackle the issue. In this paper we challenge both these \nassumptions. We provide evidence of orphan coping and resilience, even in adverse settings, and \nhighlight six psychosocial resources that we believe can facilitate the development of \u2018orphan \ncompetent communities\u2019, where local people are able to work with one another, and in partnership \nwith support agencies, to identify support strategies and resources that are most appropriate for \nfacilitating latent community strengths and local coping responses. \n \nWe argue that frameworks that view orphans as helpless victims or a burden are neither accurate, \nnor are they useful tools for action. Sustainable and meaningful action is most likely to result from \napproaches that seek to identify and strengthen the \u2018portfolio of assets\u2019 available even within poor \ncommunities (Moser, 1998). We will illustrate this with examples from Skovdal\u2019s recent research in \nwestern Kenya (Skovdal, Ogutu, Aoro, & Campbell, 2009). Furthermore, we argue that the solutions \nneed to come from the orphans, their fostering households and host communities themselves, rather \nthan being generated and imposed by outsiders, who often have very limited understandings of the \ndynamics and resources that determine children\u2019s vulnerabilities (Schenk, Ndhlovu, Tembo, Nsune, \nNkhata, Walusiku et al., 2008). In developing the concept of an \u2018orphan competent community\u2019, we \nadapt Campbell\u2019s conceptualisation of a \u2018AIDS competent community\u2019. We conclude by referring to a \ncommunity-based capital cash transfer (CCCT) project that aims to facilitate the pathways between \nresilience and coping of children affected by AIDS, and what we believe are the characteristics of \norphan competent communities. \n \n \nThe coping and resilience of children affected by AIDS \nThe impact of AIDS on children can be devastating, making them vulnerable to reduced access to \neducation (D. Evans & Miguel, 2007), poor health (Andrews, Skinner, & Zuma, 2006), malnutrition \n(Mishra, Arnold, Otieno, Cross, & Hong, 2007), stigma (Campbell, Foulis, Maimane, & Sibiya, 2005) \nand challenged mental health (Cluver & Gardner, 2007). We believe that these needs are best \nunderstood and targeted through strength-based research and interventions. The concepts of coping \nand resilience are increasingly applied to research about children affected by AIDS in Africa (Ansell \n& van Blerk, 2004; Daniel, Apila, Bjorgo, & Lie, 2007; R. Evans, 2005; Fjermestad, Kvestad, Daniel, \n& Lie, 2008; Skovdal et al., 2009). These concepts allow us to acknowledge the active role of \nchildren in coping with adversity. They shift the emphasis away from what Ennew (2005) refers to as \na current predominant focus on the \u2018burdens\u2019 of fostering orphans (e.g. Oburu & Palmerus, 2005; \nSsengonzi, 2009) to a focus on the active and positive contributions by many fostered children to \nsustain the livelihoods of their host households (e.g. Abebe & Aase, 2007; Skovdal, 2009). Ungar\u2019s \n(2008) definition of resilience as the outcome of a process of active negotiation between individuals \nand their social environments provides a useful starting point for our strengths-based orientation. His \ndynamic understanding of the individual-community interface is a useful framework for those who \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 4 \nseek to promote culturally relevant and meaningful responses to the care and support of children \naffected by AIDS. \n \nIn our recent research in western Kenya, we highlight the resilience of children actively engaged in \ncoping with challenging circumstances under conditions of great adversity (Skovdal et al., 2009). We \ndocument three ways in which children do this, each of which will be discussed in turn.  \n \n1. Children cope through actively contributing to household survival, through income \ngenerating activities, and by helping to nurse sick or disabled guardians and their family \nmembers. \n2. Children cope by mobilising support. \n3. Children cope by constructing positive identities. \n \nChildren cope through household sustaining activities  \nWhilst some children are incorporated into capable and adaptive fostering households, many \nchildren end up living in ruptured and poor households, motivated to take on orphans because of \ntheir ability to contribute and sustain the household through work (Abebe & Aase, 2007; Skovdal, \n2009). Some of the more vulnerable households are those with bedridden, sick (Robson et al., \n2006), or ageing (Nyambedha, Wandibba, & Aagaard-Hansen, 2003a; Nyambedha et al., 2003b) \nmembers. Whilst elderly and sick foster parents might provide valuable emotional support, they \nmight not be able to provide for children\u2019s material and physical needs (Robson et al., 2006; Young \n& Ansell, 2003). In such situations many children are forced to take on nursing, head of house and \nincome generating responsibilities (Skovdal et al., 2009). \n \nIn our study, many fostered orphans made a vital contribution to their households through their \nparticipation in income generating activities. These included poultry keeping, tending of goats and \ncows, subsistence farming, cultivation of fruit trees, and burning of charcoal (Skovdal et al., 2009). \nHowever, none of these activities occurred without some level of negotiation with other social actors. \nThe children often had to negotiate access to land from neighbours or their fostering household, or \nnegotiate selling prices and make good use of the resources (e.g. animals and fruit trees) at their \ndisposal. Similar observations have been made in Ethiopia where children worked on other people\u2019s \nfarms and engaged in other informal work activities in towns and market places (Abebe, 2007).  \n \nChildren cope by mobilising support \nMany children also manage to mobilise social support. In Kenya, we found children actively asking \nfor support from extended family members, neighbours, teachers, church, and community groups. \nSome support, for example emotional, food, or school materials was readily available in certain \ncases. Much of the social support, however, required significant negotiation, often involving \nreciprocity of care and support between the adults and the children (Skovdal et al., 2009). This is \nwell illustrated by 12-year-old Kevin from Kenya, who, in order to negotiate food from his neighbours, \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 5 \nhelps them work their land: \u201cIf I have no food, I get it from the neighbours and in exchange I assist \nthem in harvesting maize, sorghum and beans\u201d (Skovdal, in press). Although the children are not \nalways expected to reciprocate favours, they often do so in a conscious effort to nurture potentially \nprotective social relationships. \n \nThe large number of local community groups, such as widow, women and church groups, that \ncharacterise the social landscape of many communities in Africa continue to be a valuable source of \nsupport for many vulnerable children (Nyambedha & Aagaard-Hansen, 2007). In Kenya, we also \nobserved the capability of children to mobilise very effective friendship groups and networks through \nwhich they negotiated both emotional and practical support (Skovdal et al., 2009). Similar \narrangements have also been identified by Donald and Clacherty (2005) in South Africa.  \n \nChildren cope through identity construction and meanings \nIdentity construction shapes the way in which the children see the world and their communities and \ngive meaning to their circumstances, and is a key dimension of coping. Woodhead (1998) reports on \nthe active role working children play in giving meaning to difficult circumstances, enabling them to \nmake the best of their situation and cope successfully. Similarly in Kenya, we observed how children \ncaring for their ailing or ageing guardians drew on the positive social recognition of their \nresponsibilities to make sense of their circumstances and to build a positive caregiver identity. This \nwas based on their view of themselves as exercising vitally important and valuable social \nresponsibilities within their households and communities (Skovdal & Ogutu, 2009). Children were \nalso found to draw on previous caring experiences, suggesting that caring identities can be long-\nlasting (ibid.).     \n \nTowards a social psychology of coping \nIt is evident that the quality of care and support available to children affected by AIDS is shaped by \nthe complex interaction between individual children and the community contexts in which they find \nthemselves. In Kenya we found children\u2019s coping to be determined by the extent to which they \nnegotiated support from, and participated in community life (Skovdal et al., 2009). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis conceptualisation of coping opens up a new level of analysis, one that explores community-\nbased activities and the impact of community relations on the coping of individuals, facilitating the \nChildren\u2019s coping is influenced by: \nI. The on-going process of negotiation between the individual and the \ncommunity. This shapes the child\u2019s identity, as well as their access to \nlocal support networks and resources to tackle adversity;  \nII. The quality of the community in which they live, and its ability to share \nresources; and  \nIII. Children\u2019s different abilities to negotiate community support.  \n \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 6 \ndevelopment of more effective and context-specific policies and practices. Since children\u2019s \nparticipation and coping does not happen within a vacuum, but is dependent on the quality of their  \ncommunity, struggling households are best supported through the building of orphan competent \ncommunities, which we discuss below. \n \n \n \nOrphan Competent Communities \nHow do we begin to conceptualise the types of communities that are mostly like to provide optimal \nsupport for orphans? Campbell\u2019s concept of the \u2018AIDS competent community\u2019 is one starting point \n(Campbell, Nair, & Maimane, 2007; Campbell, Nair, Maimane, & Gibbs, 2009, in press). She defines \nthis as a community where people are most likely to work collaboratively to tackle the challenges of \nHIV\/AIDS (including avoiding infection, caring for the sick, and accessing support and treatment). \nReflecting the above discussions, Campbell (2003) argues that many AIDS projects in sub-Saharan \nAfrica have had disappointing results because they have involved interventions by outside \nprofessionals who often had poor understandings of the needs, interests and worldviews of target \ncommunity members. Against this background she argues that programmes should seek to identify \nand facilitate local community responses rather than intervening from the outside. \n \nShe argues that people are most likely to respond effectively to HIV\/AIDS when they have a sense \nof agency and confidence in their ability to respond effectively, as well as partnerships with \nsupportive outside agencies. She defines an AIDS competent community in terms of the following \nsix dimensions: \n \n\u2022 Appropriate knowledge and skills \n\u2022 Opportunities for community members to discuss the challenges of AIDS, think critically \nabout obstacles to tackling it effectively, and brainstorm ways people can work together to \ntackle the obstacles \n\u2022 The ability to recognise and appreciate local strengths and coping resources \n\u2022 A sense of confidence and agency (rather than fatalism and waiting for outsiders or the \ngovernment to come and tackle the problem) \n\u2022 A sense of within-community solidarity \n\u2022 Ability to identify, mobilise, and access outside sources of support \n \nThis is a useful starting point for our concept of an \u2018orphan competent community\u2019. However, in the \ncase of orphans, we need to expand it with more specific reference to the material and social \nresources needed to support orphans, and further develop the concrete strategies required to build \norphan competence. Drawing on work in Western Kenya (Skovdal, 2009; Skovdal et al., 2008; \nSkovdal et al., 2009), we conceptualise an orphan competent community as one in which orphans \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 7 \nand their fostering households are best able to successfully negotiate and access support from their \nsocial environments (including extended family, friends, neighbours, self-help and volunteer groups, \nchurch groups, schools, NGO and government welfare services). We believe that this \nconceptualisation provides a useful framework for analysing the contexts in which orphan care and \nsupport programmes are located, in the interests of formulating locally appropriate intervention \nstrategies and local responses. Reflecting upon our observations in Western Kenya, we propose six \npsychosocial building blocks that we believe characterise an orphan competent community. \n \nKnowledge and Skills  \nResidents of orphan competent communities should acknowledge the magnitude of the HIV and \nAIDS epidemic and have good factual information about the disease and its impact on children.  \nResidents should also have a sound understanding and awareness of local coping strategies and \ncommunity responses to orphan care and support. These include an awareness of the activities that \nhelp children cope, and the availability of existing community services, such as community health \nworkers and barefoot paralegals. If community members have an awareness of the challenges \nfacing them and the knowledge and skills to follow up on these challenges, they are more like to take \nownership of the challenges posed by growing numbers of AIDS orphans, They will also see \nthemselves as having an active role to play in tackling this issue, rather than waiting passively for \ngovernment or NGOs to come and solve the problem.  \n \nRecognition of local strengths and agency \nIt is important for community members to recognise and have confidence in their own assets and \nlocal strengths. These include their collective ability to support orphans and their individual efforts to \nmake a difference in their lives. An example of collective support for orphans includes community \ninitiatives such as communal gardens cultivated by community members to generate food for \norphans, or orphan day care activities to educate the youngest and non-school going children. If \nindividuals are confident in their local strengths, they are more likely to become involved in decisions \nthat affect the lives of children affected by AIDS. Agency and confidence in community initiatives is \nbest facilitated through practical experiences (Cornish, 2006). \n \nBuilding partnerships and access to resources  \nIt is vital that communities have the capacity to build support partnerships with local and outside \ncommunity groups and organisations that can facilitate them in supporting orphans. It is beneficial \nfor a marginalised community to work in partnership with agencies and individuals who have the \npolitical and economic power to facilitate effective local community responses. Such alliances can \ngenerate resources that poor communities would otherwise not be able to access (Campbell, 2003). \nThis type of \u2018bridging\u2019 social capital has been identified as a precondition for effective community \nresponses to AIDS (Gillies, 1998; Szreter & Woolcock, 2004). \n \nSolidarity and connectedness   \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 8 \nCommunities that are characterised by sympathetic and supportive relationships provide the optimal \ncontext in which children and households affected by AIDS can negotiate support. This includes \naccess to much-needed resources, such as land for cultivation, livestock, food, money for school-\nrelated costs, and in general, empathy. In an orphan competent community, solidarity and \nconnectedness allow people to support each other despite differences such as position in society, or \nwhether one fosters orphans, and work for a common purpose. Relationships of solidarity also \nprovide favourable conditions for supportive social spaces to emerge. \n \nSupportive Social Spaces  \nCommunity members need supportive and sympathetic social spaces in which they can collectively \ndiscuss their anxieties about the orphan issue, brainstorm ways in which they might support children \naffected by AIDS, and the types of support they require. Similarly, children affected by AIDS need \nsupportive social spaces in which they can easily negotiate support and discuss issues that affect \nthem. In many sub-Saharan African settings, local community organisations and initiatives have \ngrown from the response to the increasing number of children affected by AIDS. Schools and church \ngroups can provide children with supportive social spaces. Supportive social spaces can be \nfacilitated through initiatives such as Stepping Stones (Welbourn, 1995), Community Conversations \n(UNDP, 2004) and Participatory Learning and Action tools (Rifkin & Pridmore, 2001). In supportive \nand safe social spaces, community members and children are more like to refine and develop \nhealth-enabling social identities through engaging in dialogue about their life challenges and how \nbest to respond to these.  \n \nPositive Social Identities \nSocial identities arise from membership of an \u2018in-group\u2019 or community, and our need to locate \nourselves in the environment in which we live, evolving from our desire to stand out and belong to \nparticular social groups (Howarth, 2001, 2002). Social identities can also be imposed and, instead of \nbeing a member of an in-group, one can become a member of an out-group (Markova, 2007). \nChildren affected by AIDS may therefore see themselves as a distinct group of children (in-group) \nand develop strong bonds, or be alienated by school friends due to stigma of AIDS (out-group), \nprocesses that can both hinder and facilitate coping. For this reason, efforts should be made to \nunderstand and facilitate the role of positive identities in supporting AIDS-affected children and \ncommunities. \n \nWay forward \nWe believe that the six psychosocial resources highlighted above constitute factors that enhance the \nability of communities to offer optimal support to AIDS-affected children, in ways that reinforce \nchildren\u2019s resilience and coping, and that build on the actual and latent strengths and resources that \nexist even in resource-poor communities. Our focus on children\u2019s coping and resilience is a \nresponse to the simplistic representation of children affected by AIDS as inevitably \u201cvulnerable, \nscarred, and wary of life\u201d (Kelly, 2003:61). Whilst there have been some reservations about a focus \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 9 \non coping, given the extremely negative social circumstances of many children and households \n(Kesby, Gwanzura-Ottemoller, & Chizororo, 2006; Rugalema, 2000), we believe that negative \nrepresentations, such as those cited above, do not do justice to the remarkable engagement and \ningenuity in coping which many children are able to demonstrate, even in conditions of desperation \nand struggle  (Panter-Brick, 2002). However, we strongly believe that an emphasis on the potential \nresilience of children and communities should not be made without a parallel emphasis on the need \nfor agencies to support local community responses that seek to support and bolster the capacities \nand strengths of children and their communities, and to strengthen and support such resilience. In \nthis regard we have highlighted the psychosocial resources that hinder or facilitate the building of \norphan competent communities. In our view, it is vital that service providers who seek to support \nAIDS-affected communities and children prioritise the promotion of these six psychosocial resources \nthrough participatory projects, enhanced by appropriate support alliances. \n \nHowever, only a few interventions combine access to valued resources, participation and self-\ndetermination in ways that optimise the agency and competence of community members to support \nchildren (Prilleltensky, Nelson, & Peirson, 2001). It remains a challenge to develop and evaluate \nactionable interventions that seek to develop orphan competent communities. The first author is \ncurrently engaged in a promising CCCT project that seeks to develop orphan competence. In the \nproject, communities (either defined geographically or because of their shared objectives) partner \nwith a funding agency. The agency engages community members in a series of participatory \nprocesses facilitated through various participatory learning and action techniques (Rifkin & Pridmore, \n2001). These techniques allow community members to critically engage and observe the \ncircumstances that impact the lives of children affected by AIDS, which are subsequently translated \ninto community-level action plans. These plans are funded with the aim of strengthening and \nsupporting promising community responses to the care and support of children affected by AIDS. \nEarly observations from this project, as well as the processes involved in implementing it, highlight \nthe ability of CCCT to facilitate supportive social spaces, solidarity and connectedness, confidence in \nlocal strengths and ownership (Skovdal, 2006; Skovdal et al., 2008), as well as improved school \nattendance and performance of orphans (Mwasiaji, Webale, Skovdal, & Tomkins, 2008). \n \nThe usual problems \u2013 documented repeatedly in the community psychology literature (Cooke & \nKothari, 2001; Labonte, 2004; Mansuri & Rao, 2004; White, 1996) - challenge the project, three of \nwhich are mentioned here. Firstly, as many critics have repeatedly emphasised, the boundaries of \ncommunities constantly shift, so that our target communities by no means existed as stable or fixed \nentities. The highly mobile nature of orphans (cf. Nyambedha & Aagaard-Hansen, 2003) has \nseverely challenged project facilitators. Drop-out rates have been higher than originally anticipated \u2013 \nas youthful project participants move from one area to the next, in relation to the complex and \nextended geographical locations of each child\u2019s care-giving networks. Secondly we are ever \nconscious of well-documented warnings that community participation projects - designed to support \nthe most marginalised members of a community - may easily be hijacked by more powerful \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C. (2010) \u201cOrphan Competent Communities: A Framework for Community Analysis and Action\u201d \nVulnerable Children and Youth Studies 5(S1):19-30 \n 10 \ncommunity members. In our child-focused project, ceaseless efforts are made by project facilitators \nto ensure that adult assistance is offered in ways that support children\u2019s empowerment. Children \noften need adult assistance with their income generating activities, for example, for tasks such as \nwatering plants or checking on goats whilst children are at school. However, this assistance should \nbe offered within the context of a more general acceptance by adults of children\u2019s ownership of the \nproject, rather than leading adults to use their participation as a stepping stone to hijacking the \nproject for their own interests. This is not always easy to achieve. In this regard, NGO staff have an \nimportant and challenging monitoring and facilitating role as external change agents, in ensuring that \nthe child-centred ethos of the project is recognised by adult helpers. Finally, our experience also \nechoes frequent warnings by researchers and health workers not to romanticise communities - to \nassume that community members always have the good of orphans at heart, for example. In our \nstudy community, several foster parents prevented orphans from participating in the projects \nbecause they felt it would distract them from their domestic duties in their foster homes. However, \ndespite many challenges, the project is already yielding significant gains for some child participants, \nand as such serves as a promising example of ways in which child and community coping \nmechanisms might be supported and facilitated in ways that respect and enhance children\u2019s \ncompetencies and agency.  \n  \nIn summary, what transpires from our framework above is the importance of how researchers and \nservice providers approach the needs of children affected by AIDS. If we want to support children \naffected by AIDS, we should begin to look at their latent coping strategies and the role of \ncommunities and households in building their resilience \u2013 moving away from seeing children as \npassive victims. Only then will we be able to understand the psychosocial processes that hinder or \nfacilitate the coping of children affected by AIDS. Clearly this is a complex enterprise with many \npotential pitfalls, but in our view it is the approach that offers the greatest hope of success in the long \nterm. The success of any participatory programmes seeking to enhance, strengthen or build orphan \ncompetence of a community, are dependent on the attitudes of all the people involved, right from a \ncommunity level through to the donors and service providers. Finally, as factors determining the \norphan competence of a community and children\u2019s agency are likely to differ across space and time, \nit is important for interventions and researchers to take account of the local context of children \naffected by AIDS on a case by case basis.  \n \nTo cite this article: \nSkovdal, M. and Campbell, C.
