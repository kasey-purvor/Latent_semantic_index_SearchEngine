INTRODUCTION\nWhen two or more oscillatory processes are coupled,\nthere exists the possibility of their becoming synchronized.\nWhere their autonomous frequencies are different but close,\nsynchronization is understood as the adjustment of those fre-\nquencies as a result of coupling. Even when such systems\noperate on different time scales, synchronization may still\nappear as an adjustment of their frequencies to an integer\nratio, an effect known as high-order synchronization or syn-\nchronization of order n :m.\nSynchronization of order n :m has been extensively stud-\nied, both experimentally and theoretically \u0001see Ref. \u00031\u0004 for a\nreview\u0002. For instance, Simonet and co-workers \u00032\u0004 investi-\ngated a ruby nuclear magnetic resonance laser with delayed\nfeedback. The undriven laser exhibited periodic oscillations\nof light intensity at a frequency \u00020\u000540 Hz. An external pe-\nriodic voltage, either sinusoidal or square wave, was then\nadded in the feedback loop. In both cases, synchronizations\nof different order n :m were observed. Another example is\nthe electrical rotator consisting of a Josephson junction,\nshunted by a capacitor, and fed with a constant external cur-\nrent. Experiments show that this system can be synchronized\nwhen a periodic driving current is applied, or where two\njunctions are coupled \u00033\u0004. There are many additional ex-\namples.\nSynchronization has also been observed extensively in bi-\nology. One example is the cardiorespiratory system, consid-\nered in the pioneering works by Kenner et al., Hildebrandt,\nand Raschke \u00034\u0004. Sch\u00e4fer and co-workers \u00035\u0004 proposed the\nsynchrogram as a tool to visualize cardiorespiratory synchro-\nnization. When plotting the instantaneous respiratory phase\nat the occurrence of a heartbeat versus time, they found hori-\nzontally striped plots for some subjects, thereby revealing\nn :1 synchronization between heart and respiration. Toledo et\nal. \u00036\u0004 showed that the probability of such synchronization\nhappening by chance was extremely small. In measurements\non anesthetized rats, Stefanovska et al. \u00037\u0004 observed lengthy\nsynchronization epochs, and transitions from one ratio to an-\nother. They suggested that such transitions might be useful in\nmonitoring depth of anesthesia.\nThere are several nonlinear models yielding n :m synchro-\nnization. Arnold proposed \u00038\u0004 a map of the circle into itself,\nobtaining synchronization \u201ctongues\u201d and calculating their\nwidths in the approximation of small coupling. In fact, any\norientation-preserving homeomorphism h :S1\u2192S1 of the\ncircle into itself presents such regions of n :m locking \u00039,10\u0004.\nIntegrate-and-fire models provide several examples of Ar-\nnold tongues \u000311\u0004. High-order synchronization regions were\nalso obtained by Glass and Sun \u000312\u0004 for an impulse-driven\nPoincar\u00e9 oscillator. Schilder and Peckham \u000313\u0004 treated Ar-\nnold tongues numerically, and they obtained tongues for the\nsystem of two coupled Van der Pol oscillators; here the\ntongues are quite narrow, so that the probability of locking in\na real, noisy system would therefore be very small. Simonet\nand co-workers proposed a model \u00032\u0004 that reproduced the\nsynchronizations observed in the laser. For cardiorespiratory\nsynchronization, Kotani et al. \u000314\u0004 developed a model, based\non those of DeBoer et al. \u000315\u0004 and Seidel and Herzel \u000316\u0004,\nwhich is supported on both physiological and mathematical\nprinciples. The model involves a somewhat complicated sys-\ntem consisting of several oscillators and interactions, and\nincludes some nonanalytic parts \u0001integrate-and-fire\u0002. Because\nof technical difficulties encountered when tackling nonlinear\nmodels, the deep mechanisms through which synchroniza-\ntion takes place are not yet understood in general, so that\nthere is still no way of predicting which equations, and\nwhich values of their parameters, will or will not yield syn-\nchronization.\nThe present paper has two main purposes. First we\npresent a systematic study of high-order synchronization in a\nparticularly simple system, a rotator under harmonic forcing,\nfor which we can establish the roles played by each of its\nparameters in synchronization. Although we study a specific\nsystem, and although the deep mechanisms responsible for\nsynchronization are not unveiled in this paper, we report be-\nlow two results that we believe will be useful in the quest for*d.garcia-alvarez@lancaster.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 77, 056203 \u00012008\u0002\n1539-3755\/2008\/77\u00015\u0002\/056203\u00018\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society056203-1\nthose deep mechanisms: we show that the main Arnold\ntongues are wider when \u0001\u02d9 depends more strongly on \u0001; and\nthat competition occurs between synchronization regions.\nOur second purpose is to discuss and explore two possible\nmechanisms giving rise to an extensively observed phenom-\nenon: transitions between the different n :m synchronization\nratios. The mechanisms considered here arise from time vari-\nability. We will also discuss briefly why time variability hin-\nders the analysis of synchronization in experimental data.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we introduce\nthe simple rotator whose synchronization properties are to be\nconsidered. Section III discusses how its regions of n :1 and\nn :m synchronization are identified and reports the main re-\nsults obtained under stationary conditions, including the ob-\nservation of competition between the tongues. Time variabil-\nity and its effect on transitions between different synchro-\nnization states is discussed in Sec. IV. Section V summarizes\nthe main conclusions.\nII. THE SYSTEM\nThe generic equation for the angle \u0001 of a rotator without\nexternal interaction is \u0001\u02d9 = f\u0001\u0001\u0002, where f is a 2\u0003-periodic func-\ntion \u000317,18\u0004. Therefore, such a system can be studied system-\natically by considering functions f up to a certain number k\nof harmonics, and allowing a bigger number k+1 of harmon-\nics at the next stage of the study. In this paper, we start the\nstudy for a function consisting of the zero harmonic \u0001the\n\u201cconstant force,\u201d thanks to which a rotator has the features of\na self-sustained oscillator\u0002 and the first harmonic. By means\nof a translation in the value of \u0001, it can always be written as\n\u0001\u02d9 = a0 + a1 cos \u0001 , \u00011\u0002\nwith a0 and a1 constants, where Eq. \u00011\u0002 is an Adler-type\nequation \u000319\u0004. We assume a0\u0004 \u0006a1\u0006 so that, in the absence of\ninteraction \u0003nothing is added to Eq. \u00011\u0002\u0004, the angle \u0001 continu-\nously increases. For a0 much bigger than a1, \u0001 increases at an\nalmost constant rate. For a1 close to a0, however, \u0001\u02d9 varies\nstrongly with \u0001. We show that Eq. \u00011\u0002 can synchronize to an\nexternal forcing, exhibiting a wide variety of Arnold tongues,\nand we discuss the processes that may be responsible for\ntransitions between different n :m synchronization ratios.\nThe equations for the overdamped pendulum, and the\noverdamped Josephson junction, are of just this type. The\nequation of motion of a pendulum driven by a constant\ntorque K is described by\n\u0005\u00a8 + \u0006\u0005\u02d9 + \u00072 sin \u0005 =\nK\nI\n, \u00012\u0002\nwhere \u0007 is the frequency of small oscillations, \u0006\u00040 is the\ndamping constant, and I is the moment of inertia.\nIn a resistively shunted Josephson junction, the current is\na sum of three contributions: a superconducting current\nIc sin \u0005, a current V \/R through the resistance, and a capaci-\ntance current V\u02d9 C. The parameter Ic is called the critical su-\npercurrent of the junction. The relationship between the po-\ntential V and the \u201cangle\u201d \u0005 is given by the Josephson\nformula\n\u0005\u02d9 =\n2e\n\b\nV , \u00013\u0002\nwhere e is the electronic charge. Summation of the three\nterms yields the equation for a junction fed with an external\ncurrent I\nI = Ic sin \u0005 +\n\b\n2eR\nd\u0005\ndt\n+\nC\b\n2e\nd2\u0005\ndt2\n. \u00014\u0002\nEquations \u00012\u0002 and \u00014\u0002 coincide. In the overdamped limit,\nwhen the term with the second derivative can be neglect-\ned\u2014in the case of the Josephson junction, this means that\nthere is no capacitor in the circuit\u2014these equations reduce to\nthe one that we study in this paper, Eq. \u00011\u0002. Thus the results\nthat we obtain below will be applicable to the overdamped\npendulum and the overdamped Josephson junction.\nAs Eq. \u00011\u0002 is analytically integrable, we find that the fre-\nquency for the noninteracting rotator is\n\u00020 =\n1\n2\u0003\n\u0007a02 \u2212 a12. \u00015\u0002\nWe now consider the effect of an external harmonic force on\nthe rotator\n\u0001\u02d9 = a0 + a1 cos \u0001 + B sin\u0001\tt\u0002 , \u00016\u0002\nwith B\n0. This equation applies to a number of situations in\nnature. In the case of a Josephson junction, Eq. \u00016\u0002 describes\nwhen the system is fed with a continuous intensity plus a\nharmonic one. In relation to cardiorespiratory synchroniza-\ntion, Eq. \u00016\u0002 can be regarded as a very simple model in\nwhich the rotator Eq. \u00011\u0002 models the heart, and the addition\nof the harmonic component models its interaction with res-\npiration \u000320,21\u0004. Equation \u00016\u0002 has been studied \u00031\u0004 for large\namplitudes B of the harmonic component. However, we are\ninterested here in the Arnold tongues down to very small\ndriving amplitude, in order that we can also apply the results\nto the weakly coupled rotator.\nEquation \u00016\u0002 defines a circle map with the following pre-\nscription: let us call ti the time at which the external driving\nis at its ith maximum. We define \u0001i\b\u0001\u0001ti\u0002. As Eq. \u00016\u0002 is a\nfirst-order differential equation and we have an initial condi-\ntion \u0001\u0001ti\u0002, we could integrate to obtain \u0001\u0001t\u0002. Let ti+1 be the\ntime at which the external driving is at its i+1 maximum,\nand let \u0001i+1\b\u0001\u0001ti+1\u0002. That is how we have the map h :S1\n\u2192S1 defined as \u0001i+1=h\u0001\u0001i\u0002. We would therefore expect the\nexistence of Arnold tongues \u00039,10\u0004.\nIII. SYNCHRONIZATION AND ARNOLD TONGUES\nA. Synchronization of a rotator driven\nby an external periodic force\nNow we introduce the concept of n :m synchronization\nthat will be used in this work. Suppose we have a rotator\ndriven by a TE-periodic external action \u0001\u02d9 = f\u0001\u0001\u0002+g\u0001t\u0002 with\nf\u0001\u0001+2\u0003\u0002= f\u0001\u0001\u0002 \u2200 \u0001 , g\u0001t+TE\u0002=g\u0001t\u0002 \u2200 t. Then, any T-per-\niodic motion of \u0001, \u0001\u0001t+T\u0002=\u0001\u0001t\u0002mod 2\u0003, must have a period\nthat is a multiple of the driving period. Let m\u0001N be such\nGARC\u00cdA-\u00c1LVAREZ, STEFANOVSKA, AND MCCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 77, 056203 \u00012008\u0002\n056203-2\nthat T=mTE. Let n\u0001N\u0002 \t0\n be the number of times that the\nangle crosses \u0001=0 mod 2\u0003 with \u0001\u02d9\u00040 in one of its periods\nT=mTE. We then say that the rotator is n :m synchronized to\nthe external driving g. The synchrogram consists then of\nhorizonal lines, albeit not necessarily equally spaced. Note\nthat any periodic motion of the forced rotator automatically\nimplies n :m locking to the external action for some n and m.\nB. Saddle-node bifurcation\nPutting the above definition of n :m synchronization into\nmathematical terms, we say that the rotator gets synchro-\nnized n :m to the external force if there exists a stable root\n\u0001zero\u0002 for the function\nhnm\u0001\u0001\u0002 \b hm\u0001\u0001\u0002 \u2212 2\u0003n \u2212 \u0001 , \u00017\u0002\nwhere hm stands for the return map h composed with itself m\ntimes. In general, if hnm has two or more roots, there is at\nleast a stable fixed point. Regardless of the initial condition,\nthe trajectory is attracted toward a stable fixed point. The\nfunction hnm depends, of course, on the parameters of Eq.\n\u00016\u0002, so it changes as we vary the external driving frequency\n\t. At the moment of transition from two zeros to no zero,\nthere is only one root, on which hnm is tangent to the hori-\nzontal axis, this single zero is a half-stable fixed point. At\nthis moment, a saddle-node bifurcation takes place.\nObtaining the borders of the Arnold tongues therefore in-\nvolves retrieving the two driving frequencies at which the\nsaddle-node bifurcation takes place for different values of the\ndriving amplitude B. For this purpose a continuation soft-\nware was written in C. The first step was to obtain the\nPoincar\u00e9 return map h, so the interval \u00030,2\u0003\u0004 was divided\ninto many points. At each of these, the function hm was ob-\ntained by integration of the differential equation \u00016\u0002 with the\nfourth-order Runge-Kutta method, thereby obtaining hnm\u0001\u0001\u0002\n=hm\u0001\u0001\u0002\u22122\u0003n\u2212\u0001. For given values of B and \t, we know that\nwe are inside the tongue if hnm has two or more roots, and\noutside if hnm has no zeros. Hence, for a given value of B, we\ncan trace the left and right values of \t at which the saddle-\nnode bifurcation takes place, up to the desired precision. We\nstart with zero driving amplitude B=0; for this value the\ntongue consists of only one point \t=m\t0 \/n\u2014this will not\nbe forced when we study the bifurcations in the \u201cflexible\u201d\nway for very narrow tongues, see Sec. III F. For the next\nvalue of the coupling \u0001positive but close to 0\u0002, we start from\n\t=m\t0 \/n and look for the two bifurcation points. Then, for\nsequentially increasing values of B, we first guess approxi-\nmately the bifurcation points on the left and right boundaries\nby linear extrapolation from the two former bifurcation fre-\nquencies in each case. Starting from this guessed value, the\nprogram looks for the correct bifurcation point. In some\ntongues and for small values of B, the synchronization region\nis so narrow that the program cannot retrieve the bifurcation\npoints. In such cases, the program skips this value of B, goes\nto the next B, and sets the starting point \u0001the \u201cguessed value\u201d\nof the bifurcation frequency\u0002 based on the former bifurcation\npoints that were successfully retrieved.\nC. The n :1 synchronization regions\nWe obtained the first n :1 tongues for three combinations\nof parameters \u0001a0 ,a1\u0002 that, according to Eq. \u00015\u0002, yield the\nsame autonomous frequency for the rotator \u00020\u00051.0811:\n\u00017.08116,2\u0002, \u00019.85714,7.14286\u0002, and \u000116.46637,15\u0002. Note that\ndimensionless units are used for all variables throughout this\npaper. The results are plotted in Fig. 1. The tongues with m\n\u00041 are very narrow and the program fails to retrieve them\nby the method of seeking the saddle-node bifurcations. Later\nwe will use other less accurate methods for the high-order\ntongues. As often reported in the literature \u00038\u0004, the widest\ntongues are those for m=1. For our system Eq. \u00016\u0002, as n\nincreases, the widths of the m=1 tongues decrease and the\ntongues become closer to one another. A point of interest\nhere is that there are several Arnold tongues that are wide\nenough to be seen, not only by seeking them in a tuned\nexperiment, but also through passive observations in the\npresence of noise, e.g., the cardiovascular system \u00035,7,22\u0004.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6\n\u03bd\nB\n(a)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6\n\u03bd\nB\n(b)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6\n\u03bd\nB\n(c)\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 Arnold tongues for the externally driven\nrotator \u00016\u0002, with parameters \u0001a0 ,a1\u0002 equal to \u00017.08116,2\u0002 in \u0001a\u0002;\n\u00019.85714,7.14286\u0002 in \u0001b\u0002; and \u000116.46637,15\u0002 in \u0001c\u0002.

Thus, the value of \u0001\u02d9 depends much more strongly on \u0001\nas we move from \u0001a\u0002 to \u0001c\u0002 in Fig. 1, although the frequency\n\u00020 remains the same. The effect on the Arnold tongues is\nimmediately evident on comparing the three plots in Fig. 1:\nthe tongues become markedly wider, thereby favoring syn-\nchronization. We may therefore conjecture that a strong de-\npendence of the instantaneous frequency on angle \u0001for the\nuncoupled rotator\u0002 may help high-order synchronization.\nIn order to check this conjecture more thoroughly, we fix\nthe value of the driving amplitude B to 1.5, and we compute\nthe widths of the tongues at B=1.5 for different values of the\nparameters a0 and a1. We swept a0 from 2 to 30, and a1 from\n2 to \u0001almost\u0002 a0. In order to compute the width of the\ntongues, the code was modified, so that the two driving fre-\nquencies at which the saddle-node bifurcations take place\nwere computed only for this value of B. Starting from \t\n=m\t0 \/n, we trailed the bifurcation points first with small\nprecision, then with a greater one, recursively up to the de-\nsired precision. We plot in Fig. 2 the widths of the tongues at\nB=1.5 versus the autonomous frequency \u00020 and the param-\neter a1 \u0003to which a0 is related through Eq. \u00015\u0002\u0004. In the figure\nwe see that, for the same autonomous frequency \u00020, the\nwidths of the tongues dramatically increase with a1, confirm-\ning the conjecture that a strong dependence of \u0001\u02d9 on \u0001 \u0001for the\nuncoupled rotator\u0002 favors synchronization. Regarding this\nconjecture, it would be very interesting to add higher har-\nmonics to Eq. \u00011\u0002 and to study how the widths of the tongues\nfor the driven rotator change. Nevertheless, in this case, the\nfrequency \u00020 of the isolated rotator is not an elementary\nfunction, so it would perhaps be more convenient to calcu-\nlate this frequency numerically.\nD. Use of the synchronization index\nAs mentioned above, the tongues with m\u00041 are very nar-\nrow and the program fails to retrieve them by the method of\nseeking the saddle-node bifurcations. In order to obtain the\nsynchronization regions in such cases, we have been obliged\nto use other \u0001albeit less accurate\u0002 approaches. The first one is\nvia a synchronization index: we generated data by numerical\nintegration of Eq. \u00016\u0002 with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta\nmethod; and we analyzed them as though they were experi-\nmental data, by computing their synchronization index. With\nthe definition of synchronization we mentioned at the begin-\nning, it is natural to quantify it by how close the following\nindex \u000314\u0004 is to zero\nHmn =\n1\n2\u0003m\u0001L \u2212 n\u0002\u000b \fi=n+1\nL\n\u0001\u000bi \u2212\u000bi\u2212n \u2212 2\u0003m\u0002\u000b , \u00018\u0002\nwhere L is the total number of crossings of \u0001=0 mod 2\u0003\nwith \u0001\u02d9\u00040, and \u000b is the phase of the external action when\nthe ith crossing occurs.\nE. The n :m synchronization regions\nTo illustrate the n :m synchronization regions, we again\nplot the driving frequency \u0002 on the horizontal axis, and the\ncoupling or driving amplitude B on the vertical axis. The\nhorizontal axis was divided into 5000 points, and the vertical\none into 30 points. For each of the 150 000 corresponding\npairs of points, Eq. \u00016\u0002 was integrated. The first 60 zero-\npositive crossings were discarded to remove transients. The\nmaximum accepted value of the index Hmn \u00018\u0002 for a point to\nbe considered as belonging to the n :m Arnold tongue was\n0.0005.\nFigure 3 plots the results obtained for two of the param-\neter sets. We only plotted those tongues whose horizontal\nwidths were larger than 0.00026 for at least one value of the\ncoupling B \u0001an arbitrary cutoff chosen by trial and error, in\norder to plot neither too many nor too few tongues\u0002 \u000323\u0004.

As\nwe reduce the lower cutoff of the width criterion, many new\ntongues arise in the plot. The effect of synchronization with\nthe external action can be inferred from the fact that these\ntongues are not vertical lines, but curved.\nFurthermore, comparison of Figs. 3\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001b\u0002 shows\nthat the tongues become closer to vertical straight lines for\nsmaller a1, implying that synchronization is more and more a\nmatter of fine tuning of the external driving frequency rather\nthan of the interaction of the rotator with the external action.\nThis phenomenon provides further confirmation of our hy-\npothesis that a strong dependence of instantaneous frequency\non angle \u0001for the uncoupled rotator\u0002 helps high-order syn-\nchronization.\nF. Competition among the tongues\nThe curving of the high-order tongues in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 can be\nattributed to the occurrence of competition among tongues:\nin this case the 4:1 tongue widens as the coupling increases\nand \u201cpushes\u201d the high-order tongues. Our circle map h is\nalways invertible, because Eq. \u00016\u0002 can be integrated with\nreversed time. Therefore, lemma 1.5 in Ref. \u000310\u0004 says that\nthe Arnold tongues cannot overlap. That is the basis on\nwhich we argue that there must be competition among the\ntongues.\nWe note here several signs of such competition. First, the\n37:9 tongue appears in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002 but not in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002, because\nit is narrower there. We can interpret this effect as 33:8 and\n41:10 squeezing it for the set of parameters used in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002.\nIn the same way, the widths for 33:8 and 41:10 obtained\nvia the synchronization index in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 are of the order of\n10\u22124 at B\u21920, and of the order of 10\u22125 at B=3. Nevertheless,\nthe width of the synchronization region as B\u21920 must tend\nexactly to zero. As indicated above, the computation of Ar-\nnold tongues via a synchronization index \u0003using Eq. \u00018\u0002 in\nour case\u0004 is less accurate. Because of this evident contradic-\ntion between the obtained width of the tongue as B\u21920\n\u0001width bigger than zero\u0002 and the actual value of the width\n\u0001strictly zero\u0002, we need a more defined approach. The first try\nwas to obtain the bifurcation points with the first program\nbut it was impossible: although we set a high precision, we\nfailed to find any zeros for the function hnm.\nThat is why we are introducing the third method of ob-\ntaining approximately Arnold tongues for tricky cases such\nas this one: trailing the bifurcations in their \u201cflexible\u201d mean-\ning. Instead of considering that we are inside the tongue\nwhen hnm has a stable zero, we relax the condition and just\nask hnm to have an \u201calmost \u0001half stable\u0002 zero,\u201d defined as a\npoint where hnm takes an absolute value smaller than a\nthreshold \u0001set here to be 0.001\u0002. It means that, if we measure\nthe angle of the rotator at the times when the external action\nhas a maximum, this angle will stay for a long time around\nthis minimum \u0001or rather, minimum in absolute value\u0002. What\nhappens afterwards depends on the behavior of hnm. If hnm\nincreases quickly \u0001in absolute value\u0002 when we separate from\nthe minimum, the angle will slip and come back promptly to\nthe minimum \u0001modulus 2\u0003\u0002. If hnm is still very small when\nwe separate from the minimum, the angle will have a slow\ndrift when iterating hnm so, in practice, the system will be\nregarded as synchronized, unless the measurements are very\nprecise.\nThe tongue 33:8 obtained this way is plotted in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002,\ntogether with the 4:1 tongue obtained before. In Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002 we\nplotted the width of the 33:8 tongue as a function of the\ndriving amplitude B. Because of the \u201cflexible\u201d way of ob-\ntaining the tongue, its width tends to a value bigger than zero\nas B\u21920. The explanation is simple: without any driving\n\u0001B=0\u0002 there is no interaction, so the only possibility of hav-\ning an apparent synchronization \u2014 not true synchronization,\nas there is no interaction \u2014 is to tune the external frequency\nto the value m\u00020 \/n. This frequency is the only point of the\nArnold tongue in the limit B\u21920. The function hnm is there\nconstantly equal to zero. If we make the external frequency\nslightly different from m\u00020 \/n, with B=0, the values returned\nby the function hnm will still be very small, so many of them\nwill be below the threshold; that is the reason why the ob-\ntained width of the tongue in the limit B\u21920 is bigger than\nzero. Of course, this \u201cflexible\u201d method is not completely\naccurate, and it gives the apparent contradiction above. Nev-\nertheless, we are using this method only to obtain qualitative\nconclusions, by comparing results all obtained with the same\nmethod. So we believe that the conclusions remain valid.\nAs we can see from Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002, the width of the 33:8\ntongue is more or less constant for B near zero, and then it\nstarts dropping at around B=1.5. Looking at Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002, we\nFIG. 3. \u0001Color online\u0002 Detail of the synchronization regions in-\nside a small interval.

The width of\n33:8 reaches a minimum at B=2.5 and then it increases. In\nFig. 4\u0001a\u0002, B=2.5 is more or less the point where 4:1 switches\nfrom being concave \u0001concave from outside\u0002 to convex, so it\nis consistent with the fact that the width of 33:8 starts in-\ncreasing at this point: let us say that, before this point, 4:1\nwas \u201cinvading\u201d 33:8; from this point, 33:8 \u201cstarts recovering\nfrom 4:1\u2019s invasion,\u201d so 33:8 gains space \u0001width\u0002 and 4:1\nswitches from being concave to be convex \u0001of course, there\nare, mathematically speaking, an infinite number of tongues\nbetween 33:8 and 4:1, but 4:1 is the most dominant in the\narea so it is the main influence\u0002. The cases discussed above\nreveal clear signs of the effect of competition among\ntongues; the existence of such competition was predicted at\nthe outset on strictly theoretical grounds.\nIV. TIME VARIABILITY AND TRANSITIONS BETWEEN\nDIFFERENT SYNCHRONIZATION EPOCHS\nTransitions in time between states of different n :m syn-\nchronization ratios have often been observed experimentally\n\u00035,7,22,24\u0004. We now consider in turn two mechanisms that\nmay give rise to such transitions in our system \u00016\u0002: \u0001i\u0002 vari-\nability of the driving frequency and \u0001ii\u0002 low-frequency noise.\nThe latter is mathematically equivalent to slow variations of\nthe autonomous frequency of the rotator. Both mechanisms\ncorrespond to time variability, and they can coexist.\nA. Variability of the driving frequency\nWe again simulated the system \u00016\u0002, but modified such that\nwe replaced B sin\u0001\tt\u0002 with B sin\u0003\u000b\u0001t\u0002\u0004, and varied the in-\nstantaneous frequency \u000b\u02d9 \u0001t\u0002 linearly in time\n\u000b\u02d9 \u0001t\u0002 = at + b; \u000b\u0001t\u0002 =\n1\n2\nat2 + bt . \u00019\u0002\nThe choice of a linear variation was arbitrary, in the interest\nof clarity. With the parameters of Eq. \u00016\u0002 chosen to be\n\u0001a0 ,a1\u0002= \u00019.85714,7.14286\u0002, B=4, we slowly swept \u000b\u02d9 \u0001t\u0002 \/\n2\u0003 from 0.1 to 1.3 in a total time of 72 000. Figure 5 shows\nn :1 synchronization epochs corresponding to the times when\nthe external instantaneous frequency is inside an Arnold\ntongue. As n decreases, the synchronization epochs last\nlonger, and the transition regions widen. That is because, as\nmentioned above, the Arnold tongues are then wider and\nfurther separated. The n :2 epochs are also observed from the\nsynchrograms: Fig. 6 shows 5:2 and 3:2 synchronization ep-\nochs.\nFor a Josephson junction, transitions of this kind could be\ninduced by variation of the frequency of the harmonic com-\nponent of the current driving the system. Where we regard\nEq. \u00016\u0002 as a simple model for the heart driven by the respi-\nration, the transition mechanism would correspond to varia-\ntion of the respiration rate. Although this rate can be con-\nsciously controlled \u000325\u0004, people do not do so most of the\ntime, and so the small natural variations in respiration rate\ncan produce transitions in the synchronization ratio between\nit and the heart.\nB. Low-frequency noise\nThe second transition mechanism considered here arises\nfrom the effect of the low-frequency noise that is often\npresent in physical, biological, and economic systems. For\ninstance, flicker noise \u000326\u0004 occurs in almost all electronic\ndevices. Another example is the cardiovascular system,\nwhere there are known to be metabolic, neurogenic, and\nmyogenic \u000327\u0004 low-frequency oscillatory processes.\n\u03bd\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0.22 0.24 0.26\nB\n(a)\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0 1 2 3 4\n1\n0\n6\nW\nid\nth\nB\n(b)\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 Tongues 4:1 \u0001right\u0002 and 33:8 \u0001second\nfrom the right\u0002 for parameters \u0001a0 ,a1\u0002= \u00019.85714,7.14286\u0002.

This value of \t1 may appear low compared\nto some natural systems, but the results we will obtain re-\nmain valid for larger \t1 provided it is small compared with\nthe frequencies of the other processes. Without adding the\nlow frequency component, we would be inside the 5:1\ntongue and the synchrogram would consist of five perfect\nhorizontal lines. As shown in Fig. 7\u0001a\u0002, the corresponding\nsimulation exhibits transitions between 5:1 and 4:1. Note that\nwe have added a harmonic low-frequency component; with\nlow-frequency noise, the sequence of transitions will not be\npredictable in the manner seen here. In Fig. 7\u0001b\u0002 we see a 9:2\nepoch inside the transition region between the two longest\nepochs.\nThis second mechanism is mathematically equivalent to a\nslow variation of the intrinsic frequency of the rotator. This\ncan be seen by considering the low-frequency component to\nbe absorbed inside a0, yielding an a0, and therefore a \u00020, that\nslowly varies with time. In nature, however, the picture is\ncompletely different, as the low-frequency noise comes from\noutside the rotator.\nC. Time variability and synchronization\nAlthough we can still recognize synchronization epochs\nfrom the synchrograms by sight, time variability\u2014the origin\nof the two transition mechanisms discussed above\u2014means\nthat synchrograms no longer consist of perfect horizontal\nlines. The test via a synchronization index, often used when\ntackling real experimental data, must fail, even inside a small\ntime window, unless we take a less strict threshold for the\nindex. Our result is in agreement with that obtained in Ref.\n\u000322\u0004 by analysis of experimental data. In short, time variabil-\nity interferes with synchronization; at least for our system\nand with the index \u00018\u0002 as a quantification of synchronization.\nA more detailed and quantitative study of the influence of\ntime variability is in progress and will be reported elsewhere.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that the driven rotator Eq. \u00016\u0002 yields a\nvast variety of Arnold tongues. Our results are applicable to\nthe several systems described by this equation, including the\noverdamped pendulum and the overdamped Josephson junc-\ntion. Because the synchronization regions can be relatively\nwide, and because Eq. \u00011\u0002 is written in terms of continuous\nvariables, the equation may be useful in modeling the wide\nrange of high-order synchronization phenomena observed in\nnature, such as in the cardiorespiratory interaction. Although\nwe investigate a specific system, and although the deep\nmechanisms for synchronization are not revealed by our\nstudies in this paper, two of the results that we have obtained\nare very interesting and likely to be useful in the quest for\nthose deep mechanisms: we showed that a strong depen-\ndence of the instantaneous frequency on the angle helps\nhigh-order synchronization; and we also identified and stud-\nied the phenomenon of competition among tongues. Finally,\nwe have discussed and explored two mechanisms of transi-\ntion between different synchronization states.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank A. Bahraminasab, A. Pikovsky, and M.

For example, inside the 5:1 tongue, some areas\nwith 15:3, 20:4, etc. were obtained. These regions were\nmerged by hand into the wide tongue for two reasons: first,\nbecause visual inspection of the plot of \u0001\u0001t\u0002 together with the\nplot of the external forcing revealed that it was actually 5:1 \u0001or\n4:1\u0002 synchronization; second and more important, because ac-\ncording to Refs. \u00039,10\u0004 the characteristic parameter of synchro-\nnization in a circle map is the rotation number n \/m.\n\u000324\u0004 R.
