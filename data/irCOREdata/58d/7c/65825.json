Despite \nbeing a large geographical region, the nature of Holocene sea-level change is broadly similar in all \nlocations.  Differences do exist however, in the timing and magnitude of the Mid-Holocene High \nStand (MHHS) and the nature of late Holocene sea level fall across the region.  When the Indo-\nPacific is subdivided into smaller regions, these discrepancies do not disappear, and in some \ncases the discrepancies are large within a single coastline. \nIt is clear from this analysis that the fundamental criteria to produce accurate local relative sea-\nlevel curves are hardly ever met. There are serious problems associated with the correct \ninterpretation of sea-level indicators and their relationship to mean sea level, and with the quality of \nage determinations.  A consistent methodology throughout the Indo-Pacific for the analysis of sea \nlevel data is lacking.  Future sea-level analysis from far field locations must involve the application \nof a consistent methodology in order to allow meaningful comparison between studies.  This \nshould help to resolve the ongoing debate about the magnitude and timing of the Mid-Holocene \nHigh Stand, and the nature of late Holocene sea-level fall across the region. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n2\n2\n \n1. Introduction \nOscillations between glacial and interglacial climate conditions during the Quaternary have been \ncharacterized by the transfer of immense volumes of water between ice sheets and the oceans \n(e.g., Broecker and Denton, 1989; Alley and Clark, 1999; McManus et al., 1999; Lambeck et al., \n2002). Since the latest of these oscillations, the Last Glacial Maximum (between about 30,000 and \n19,000 years ago), approximately 50 x106 km3 of ice has melted from the land-based ice sheets, \nraising global sea level in regions distant from the major glaciation centres (far-field locations) by \nabout 130 metres (Fig 1) (e.g. Lambeck et al., 2002). In contrast, relative sea levels have dropped \nby many hundreds of metres in regions once covered by the major ice sheets (near- and \nintermediate-field locations) as a consequence of the isostatic \u2018rebound' of the solid Earth following \nthe melting of land-based ice (Shennan and Horton, 2002). Such rapid changes in sea level are \npart of a complex pattern of interactions among the oceans, ice sheets and solid earth, all of which \nhave different response timescales. Geographical variability in Holocene sea-level change is well \nillustrated by Pirazzoli\u2019s (1991) atlas of sea-level curves and by geophysical model predictions \n(e.g., Clark et al., 1978; Peltier, 2002; Shennan, et al., 2002; Lambeck et al., 2003; Mitrovicia, \n2003). Clark et al. (1978) identified six different sea-level patterns which reflect a range of sea-\nlevel histories recorded at coasts which have emerged, submerged, or are in transitional areas and \nrecord a combination of both uplift and subsidence (Fig 2). Although much contemporary research \n(e.g., Shennan and Horton, 2002) to test such theoretically derived models has focused on data \nsets from near- and intermediate-field locations (Zones I \u2013II), it is widely recognised that \u2018far-field \nlocations\u2019 (Zones III \u2013 VI) provide the best possible estimate of the \u2018eustatic function\u2019 (Clark et al., \n1978; Yokoyama et al., 2000; Peltier, 2002). Consequently, model derived reconstructions are \nincreasingly recognising the importance of these areas to constrain and test their earth-ice models \n(eg. Fleming et al. 1998).  \n2. Past sea-level changes \nAt their simplest changes in relative sea level (RSL) are a product of changes in oceanic and crustal \nvariables.   A change in relative sea level at any time or location is dependent upon a combination of \nsea surface level changes, any isostatic or tectonic changes, and local coastal processes. \nThe ocean, or eustatic level is influenced by three main groups of factors; the water volume in the \noceans; the volume of the ocean basins; and the distribution of the water. The water in the ocean \nand the volume of glacial ice on land are in balance; when one increases the other decreases. \nThis is known as glacial eustasy (first proposed by Suess, 1888). The ocean volume is also \nmodulated by a number of other factors, such as the addition of juvenile water, storage of water in \n  \n3\n3\nsediments, variations in the main hydrologic cycle changing continental lake volumes, cloudiness, \nand the evaporation\/precipitation balance. A factor of high significance is the steric \nexpansion\/contraction of the water column. These changes are driven by temperature and, to a \nlesser degree, salinity. Steric changes are advocated as one of the most important factors in future \nsea-level estimates (e.g., Houghton, 2001). The basins of the oceans may change their level by \ncrustal movements so that they increase and decrease in total volume. This is tectono-eustasy.  In \nreality, this is merely deformation of the hypsographic curve, and is a slow process, which may \nonly change sea level by 0.06 mm yr-1 (M\u00f6rner, 1996).  \nThe ocean water level also changes as the result of the global distribution of oceanic water. This is \nknown as geoidal eustasy (M\u00f6rner, 1976). The earth is not spherical, but broadly flattened at the \npoles and bulging at the equator and the ocean surface does not parallel that of the earth.  Present \ngeodetic sea level varies with respect to the earths centre by as much as 180 m.  The geoid relief \ndoes not remain stable with time; it deforms vertically as well as horizontally. During the Last \nGlacial Maximum, the weight of continental ice sheets caused downward deformation of the crust, \nforcing sublithospheric flow away from the centres of load.  A low latitude gravitational anomaly \ndeveloped creating a high in the oceanic geoid.  During the last glacial deglaciation, the continents \nviscoelastically rebounded causing the gravity anomaly to decay and the oceanic geoid to migrate \nfrom lower to higher latitudes.  This geoidal process is called equatorial ocean syphoning \n(Mitrovica and Peltier, 1991).  The relative sea level (RSL) effects of equatorial ocean syphoning \nare only seen in the late Holocene (last 3000 years), where in low latitudes oceanic islands such \nas the Cocos Keeling Islands have experienced a fall in RSL (Woodroffe and McLean 1990).   \n \nGlobal glacial isostatic adjustment is the process whereby the Earth's shape and gravitational field \nare modified in response to the large scale changes in surface mass load that have occurred due \nto the glaciation and deglaciation of the planetary surface (according to Archimedes principle). As \nshown by Daly (1934), the development of an ice sheet will result in subsidence beneath the ice \nmass (glacio isostasy), when deeper material flows away and a peripheral bulge is built around the \nice margin. When the ice sheet melts, unloading occurs, resulting in uplift beneath the melted ice \nat rates which may locally reach 50 to 100 mm yr-1 (Pirazzoli, 2000); the marginal rim will \nconsequently tend to subside and move towards the centre of the vanishing load.  Furthermore, \nduring deglaciation meltwater from the ice sheets produces a considerable load (of the order of \n100 t m2 for a sea-level rise of 100 m (Lambeck et al. 2002)) on the ocean floors so that the sea \nfloor subsides (hydro-isostasy). Interest in studying the response of the planet to these Quaternary \nglacial cycles derives primarily from the fact that the geological, geophysical and astronomical data \nwhich record them are of such high quality. Furthermore, these data are almost uniquely capable \nof providing firm constraints upon the viscoelastic properties of the \"solid\" interior of the earth and \n  \n4\n4\na wide range of processes related to the internal dynamics of the climate system itself (e.g., \nAgassiz, 1840; Lambeck, et al., 2000; Peltier, 2002; Shennan et al., 2002; Mitrovica, 2003). While \nmost studies agree on the viscosity structure through the upper mantle and transition zone, there \nis considerable controversy about the average viscosity structure of the lower mantle.  This is \nimportant in modelling the inundation of water into regions uncovered by grounded, retreating \nmarine-based ice and ocean loading at evolving continental margins (e.g., Peltier, 1998; Mitrovica \nand Milne, 2002; Peltier, 2002; Mitrovicia, 2003 Lambeck et al., 2003).  \n \nAlthough the interaction of eustatic and isostatic factors produces the general pattern of RSL \nchanges, various factors operate at the coast and within an estuary that influence the registration \nof relative sea-level changes in the fossil, sedimentary record (Shennan and Horton, 2002). In \ntectonically active areas neotectonic deformation is common and may be due to stresses \nassociated with the isostatic processes, but also due to compression, gliding, elastic rebound, \nfaulting, folding or tilting of crustal blocks. Trends of vertical displacement of tectonic origin often \nappear to be continuous and gradual over time (Pirazzoli 1996), but frequently consist of \nspasmodic movement, often suddenly at the time of earthquakes of great magnitude (eg. Zong et \nal. 2003). Other local scale factors include modifications in the tidal regime according to the \ncoastal configuration and the relationship between the freshwater table and tide levels; (Shennan \nand Horton (2002) observe a change in the elevation of MHWST in relation to MTL through the mid \nto late Holocene in the Humber estuary, UK).  Furthermore, changes in elevation of the sediment \nrecording a past sea level since the time of deposition must be taken into account.  These changes \nmay be due to consolidation because of the accumulation of overlying sediments and land \ndrainage.  \n3. Interpretation of former sea-levels  \nPalaeo sea-levels are reconstructed from a wide variety of environmental indicators including \nmorphological and archaeological data, palaeosols and other lithostratigraphic change. To produce \nsea-level index points, which allow the construction of a sea-level envelope plotted in a time\/depth-\nelevation graph, each indicator must have an indicative meaning (Fig 3). The indicative meaning of \na coastal sample is the relationship of the local environment in which it accumulated to a \ncontemporaneous reference tide level, with an associated error range (van de Plassche, 1986, \nHorton et al. 2000). The indicative meaning can vary according to the type of evidence and it is \ncommonly expressed in terms of an indicative range and a reference water level. The former is a \nvertical range within which the coastal sample can occur and the latter a water level to which the \nassemblage is assigned, for example, mean high water spring tide, mean tide level, etc.  \n  \n  \n5\n5\nBy far the most widely used sea-level indicators in far-field locations are coral. There are many \ndifferent types of coral, but only a few species are found in narrow elevation ranges (e.g., Acropora \npalmata, which lives within 5 m of the water surface (Lighty 1982) and Porites sp. which can live \nnear the surface and at depths up to 30 m (Done 1982)).   Corals in growth position are \nconstrained by water depth, and most are only able to survive up to mean low water spring tides in \nunponded locations. They are readily dated using Uranium series disequilibrium and radiocarbon \ntechniques. Unfortunately the lower depth limit of Acropora growth is relatively poorly constrained, \nleaving coral-based sea-level indicators with a large indicative range (c. \u00b15 m) (Blanchon and \nShaw 1995).  Microatolls are a particular type of intertidal coral that live near low water and have \nan indicative range as low as 3 cm (e.g., Smithers and Woodroffe, 2000). They are seen as the \nmost precise, geologically persistent and useful diagnostic sea-level indicator on coral reef \nsystems.  \n \nOther widely used sea-level indicators include geomorphological features, such as palaeoshoreline \nnotches, palaeoreef flats and beach deposits (e.g., Tija, 1996, Dickinson, 2001). These indicators \nhave wide indicative ranges, and large error terms associated with any reconstructions. Thus, for \ndetailed Holocene sea-level reconstructions it is often the case that the error term applied to the \nsea-level indicator has the same magnitude as the RSL change under investigation. Fixed \nbiological indicators are also used as sea-level indicators. These include rock clinging oyster beds \nand fossil calcareous tubeworm encrustations  (e.g., Baker and Haworth, 2000).  \n \nWith notable exceptions (eg. Cann et al. 1993, 2000a, 2000b, 2002, Li et al. 2000, Yokoyama et \nal., 2000), studies of microfossils and their relationship to RSL in far-field coastal environments of \nthe Indo-Pacific are few.  In contrast, many detailed studies of former sea levels in Northwest \nEurope and North America have used microfossils (e.g. diatoms, foraminifera, pollen) found within \nlate and post-glacial sedimentary deposits (e.g., Horton et al., 2000; Shennan and Horton, 2002). \nOne of the few studies of sedimentary facies depicting late glacial and Holocene sea-level \nchanges in a far-field location have been undertaken by Yokoyama et al. (2000) in the Bonaparte \nGulf, northern Australia. They used sediment cores and their contained foraminifera and ostracods \nto infer changing environments of deposition through time, enabling sea-level reconstructions back \nto the last glacial maximum. Despite using tightly constrained foraminifera and ostracoda \nevidence, the reconstructions based on facies descriptions such as \u2018shallow marine\u2019 and \u2018marginal \nmarine\u2019 have relatively wide indicative ranges (c. \u00b1 1 m).  \n  \n6\n6\n4. The late glacial and post-glacial period \nIt is widely implied that far-field locations have a spatially homogenous record of sea-level \nfluctuations. However, several diverse processes, such as gravitational effects causing \nmovements in the geoid and meltwater loading of the ocean floors, tectonism, thermal expansion \nof ocean water and Antarctic mass balance changes, interplay with the overwhelming eustatic \nsignal to create the relative sea-level record in far-field locations. Nevertheless, a small number of \nhigh-resolution RSL records have been used to approximate the Holocene glacio-eustatic signal \n(e.g., Fairbanks, 1989; Chappell and Polach, 1991; Blanchon and Shaw, 1995; Bard et al., 1996; \nYokoyama et al., 2000). In turn these records have been used in geophysical models to estimate \nthe ice mass at the last glacial maximum and to tune models of earth rheology. The first global \neustatic sea-level curve was generated from cored corals (Acropora palmata) in Barbados \n(Fairbanks, 1989). This record concentrates on the late glacial and early Holocene period, creating \na eustatic record for the period 17,100 to 7800 BP. Unfortunately Barbados is situated on an \naccretionary prism between two oceanic plates, and therefore is not immune to problems of \ntectonic lithospheric movement over late glacial timescales (estimated uplift of 0.34 mm yr-1). The \nmajor breakthrough of work in the Caribbean\/Atlantic region on both cored coral and sediment \ncores was the discovery of three \u2018catastrophic rise events\u2019, or Meltwater Pulses (MWPs), between \n14,200 and 7600 cal years BP.  The largest rise (approximate magnitude of 13.5 m) occurred at \n14,200 cal years BP (MWP 1a).  This coincides with a period of ice sheet collapse (Heinrich layer \n1) as defined in sediment cores from the north Atlantic, and predates the Younger Dryas cold \nevent by about 1000 years (Fig 4).  However, no consensus on the source of the ice melt has been \nreached, with contributions from North America, Scandinavia and the Barents Sea, and Antarctica \nhaving been proposed (Blanchon and Shaw, 1995; Clark, 1996; Clark et al., 2002).  \n \nFollowing this breakthrough in late glacial eustatic sea-level reconstruction, a coral coring project \nin Tahiti (Bard et al., 1996) produced a late glacial and early Holocene eustatic sea-level curve, \nwhich complements the record from Barbados. The Tahiti record has the advantage of not being \ncontaminated by a complex tectonic component, being an oceanic atoll situated in the centre of the \nPacific plate. However, Tahiti exists because of volcanic and tectonic activity in the past and is \nsubsiding at a rate of 0.2 mm yr-1 (Bard et al., 1996). This new record shows a synchronous hiatus \n(MWP1a) with the Barbados record. However, the Tahiti record questions the global significance of \nthe two other catastrophic rise events, MWP 1b at 11, 500 cal BP and MWP 2 at 7600 cal BP, both \nfound in the Caribbean\/north Atlantic records (Blanchon and Shaw 1995). \n \nA third global late glacial and early Holocene eustatic record has been inferred from raised coral \nterraces on the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea (Chappell and Polach, 1991). The Huon \n  \n7\n7\nPeninsula is tectonically active, being close to the edge of the Philippine plate, and is \nexperiencing uplift at a rate of ~1.9 mm yr-1.  By decoupling the tectonic and eustatic elements of \nRSL history in the area, a global eustatic sea-level curve has been developed. However, aseismic \nuplift on the Huon Peninsula is episodic, dominated by isolated, metre scale events with 1000 year \nreoccurrence intervals, which contaminates the record with a complex tectonic component.  \n \nThe nature of mid to late Holocene global eustatic sea-level change is less well documented. \nIndeed Nunn (1998) refers to the last millennium as a \u20181000-year hiatus\u2019 in sea-level research of \nthe Pacific (Long, 2000). Emphasis switches from aiming to produce a globally valid eustatic sea-\nlevel curve to understanding local and regional influences on RSL reconstructions. Therefore, for \nthe purposes of this review we have split the Indo-Pacific into six sub-regions; Southwest Indian \nOcean, Northern Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, Northern Asia, Australia and Pacific Ocean (Fig 5 \nand Table 1). \n4.1 Southwest Indian Ocean  \nThe southwest Indian Ocean includes the continental coastline of southeast Africa, the micro \ncontinent of Madagascar, and several oceanic atolls including Mayotte, Reunion, Mauritius and the \nSeychelles. Field observations in these locations have utilized a range of geomorphological and \nbiological indicators including beachrock, oyster beds, coral reefs and marine shells to reconstruct \nmid to late Holocene changes in RSL (e.g., Ramsay, 1995; Colonna et al., 1996; Camoin et al., \n1997; Compton, 2001; Ramsay and Cooper, 2002). The southwest Indian Ocean is tectonically \nstable, being situated towards the centre of the African plate and, therefore, observations from \nthese locations should yield important information regarding glacio-eustasy and hydro-isostasy. \nStudies of Holocene sea-level change in South Africa have relied mainly on radiocarbon dating of \nfossil beachrock. Beachrock is a reliable sea-level indicator, assuming that the skeletal carbonate \ncontent is entirely contemporary. It forms today at the freshwater\/saltwater interface at 0.1 - 0.2 m \nbelow mean sea level (Ramsay and Cooper, 2002). Ramsay (1995) produced a 9000 year record \nshowing early Holocene RSL rise to a mid-Holocene high stand of +3.5 m at 4650 14C yrs BP with \nRSL subsequently falling below present levels, but also shows a secondary high stand at 1610 14C \nyrs BP (+ 1.5 m) before mean sea level is attained at 900 14C yrs BP. The sea-level observations \nare taken from a 180 km long stretch of coastline in eastern South Africa, thus reflecting regional \nRSL influences. However, the sea-level index points are not corrected for their indicative meaning. \nFor example, some index points from the early Holocene use dated wood, which should be treated \nas limiting points, that is RSL must have been at or below the level at which they are found, \nhowever they are included in the curve as standard index points. A second investigation in South \nAfrica has concentrated on a saltmarsh lagoon on the southwest coast (Compton, 2001). This \n  \n8\n8\nlagoon is situated on the Atlantic coast, where tectonic activity has occurred through the \nHolocene, and the RSL history reflects more Atlantic rather than Indian Ocean processes. The \nRSL record, derived from radiocarbon dated saltmarsh peats, agrees with Ramsay\u2019s two mid-late \nHolocene high stands theory, and uses potentially more precise indicators (Fig 6). However, the \nindicative meaning of each indicator is not explicitly stated and all late Holocene sea-level \nfluctuations after the initial mid-Holocene peak of +3 m are within the elevation ranges of the \nindicators.  \n \nHolocene sea-level changes on the oceanic atolls of Mauritius, Reunion and Mayotte have been \ninvestigated to infer reef development histories and eustatic sea-level rise (e.g., Colonna et al., \n1996; Camoin et al., 1997). Drilled Acropora coral cores from the fringing reefs of all 3 islands \ndemonstrate a continuous rise in eustatic sea level through the early and mid Holocene, stabilizing \nto current levels at 3000 14C yrs BP. There is no evidence of two Holocene high stands in these \nlocations. However, on the microcontinent of Madagascar, in situ coral colonies have been dated \nbetween 3000 and 2000 14C yrs BP, 0.3 - 2.5 m above RSL, and at Farqhar Atoll in the Seychelles, \ncoral limestones have been dated at 3640 14C yrs BP at +2 m (Camoin et al., 1997). This apparent \ndiversity in the record may be due to the nature of these small oceanic atolls, which are affected by \nlate-Holocene hydro-isostasy, causing them to react to eustatic sea-level change in the same way \nas the ocean floor. That is, they subside with the ocean floor, whereas sublithospheric flow below \nthe sea floor is drawn to larger atolls and land masses (e.g., Seychelles, Madagascar, Africa) \n(Grossman et al., 1997).  Larger land masses record a drop in RSL through the late Holocene \nwhile small oceanic atolls experience continued sea-level rise.  \n4.2 Northern Indian Ocean \nThe northern Indian Ocean region includes studies from the east coast of India, Bangladesh and \nSri Lanka (Katupotha and Fujiwara, 1988; Islam and Tooley, 1999; Banjeree, 2000). The Indian \nsub-continent is situated on the Indian plate, which in its centre is tectonically stable. Techniques \nused to reconstruct former sea levels here include dating coral and marine shells, beach ridges \nand sedimentary sequences and their contained microfossils. Banjeree (2000) studied regional \nRSL change on the east Indian coastline, utilizing beach ridges and exposed Porites coral colonies \nto indicate two mid-late Holocene high stands, the first peaking at 3 m above current mean sea-\nlevel at 7300 cal yrs BP, followed by a c. 2 m RSL fall, and a second pulse of minor RSL rise \nculminating at +3 m between 4300 and 2500 cal yrs BP. This study analyses evidence from sites \ncovering over 150 km of coastline and, therefore, has a regional focus. The indicative meanings of \nthese records are not explicitly taken into consideration when creating sea-level index points, and \nthe contemporary reference level to which all fossil deposits are calibrated is low tide level rather \n  \n9\n9\nthan mean sea level, which precludes correlation with other studies unless the index points are \nre-calibrated.  \n \nField data from Bangladesh using multi-proxy lithostratigraphical and biostratigraphical techniques \n(Islam and Tooley, 1999) shows a continuously rising RSL record through the Holocene. The field \nsite in Bangladesh is situated on low-lying deltaic deposits, which are susceptible to long term \nsubsidence, release of sediment and water from the catchment and anthropogenic activities. \n \n4.3 Southeast Asia \nThis diverse region includes studies from the Strait of Malacca, Indonesia (Geyh and Kudrass; \n1979), Malay-Thai Peninsula (Tija, 1996), Phuket, southeast Thailand (Scoffin and Le Tissier, \n1998), Sunda Shelf (Hanebuth et al., 2001) and the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea \n(Chappell and Polach 1991). The Indonesian archipelago and its surrounding microcontinents \n(Papua New Guinea, Borneo, Peninsula Malaysia) have been subject to intense tectonic \nprocesses over the Holocene period. The region is a collision zone between the Eurasian, Indian, \nPhilippine and Pacific plates and includes the active subduction zone and island arc of the Java \ntrench, which covers a large part of southern Indonesia.  \n \nHolocene sea-level reconstructions in southeast Asia are limited and fragmentary. Tija (1996) \nstudied abrasion platforms, sea-level notches and oyster beds in Peninsula Malaysia and \nproduced over 130 radiocarbon-dated indicators. The sea-level curve, which proposes two \nHolocene high stands at 5000 and 2800 14C yrs BP, does not take into account the broad \naltitudinal range of the indicators, and the second high stand could easily be accounted for by error \nterms in the general RSL drop after 5000 BP (Fig 7). Tija\u2019s (1996) sea-level reconstruction for \nThailand, based mainly on peat, marine shells and mangrove wood, indicates potentially three \nmid\/late Holocene high stands at 6000, 4000 and 2700 14C yrs BP, which he attributes to sea level \nlowering in a series of short periods of regression and transgression. Over 100 indicators were \ntaken from around the Peninsula Coast, therefore reflecting regional rather than local influences; \nhowever it is hard to reconcile this model of sea-level history with the scattered evidence that is \npresented. Scoffin and Le Tissier (1998) studied intertidal reef-flat corals (microatolls) for mid\/late \nHolocene high stands at Phuket, Southern Thailand. The evidence here suggests a single \nHolocene high stand with a constant rate of RSL fall since 6000 cal yrs BP, and thus, contradicts \nconclusions drawn by Tija (1996). However it should be noted that Scoffin and Le Tissier\u2019s (1998) \nresearch is from only one site with eleven dated samples.  \nGeyh and Kudrass (1979) conducted a study in the Strait of Malacca, Indonesia, which resulted in \n33 directional (limiting) index points from 14C dated fossil mangrove deposits.  These index points, \n  \n10\n10\nwhich are not given an indicative meaning, imply that Holocene sea level rose from below \u201312.8 \nm to ~1.2 m above present between 8000 and 6000 14C yrs BP, and between 5000 and 4000 14C \nyrs BP rose to its highest recorded level in southeast Asia, at ~5.8 m above present (but this is a \nlimiting index point, uncorrected for indicative meaning). The data does not show whether the late \nHolocene lowering of sea level was a steady or oscillatory process.  \n \nThe Cocos Keeling Islands are a mid-oceanic atoll situated approximately 600km southwest of \nJakarta, Indonesia in the Indian Ocean. Their RSL history is recorded in massive coral and \nmicroatolls.  The microfossil record produces a detailed late Holocene RSL history showing a \nsingle Holocene high stand after 3000 14C yrs BP of at least 0.5 m (Woodroffe and McLean, 1990).  \n4.4 Northern Asia \nThe areas grouped under this heading include Japan and southeast China, bordering the South \nChina Sea. Japan is forms part of a tectonically active island arc, which makes regional sea-level \ncomparisons difficult due to local and regional crustal flexure and warping. Nakada et al. (1991) \nundertook RSL reconstructions from Osaka and Tokyo using previously published data and \nshowed a significant spatial dependence to the amplitude of the mid-Holocene high stand. Fixed \nbiological indicators (oyster beds) have been used at one site on the South China Sea coast to \ninfer the amplitude and timing of the mid-Holocene high stand; no greater than 2 m above modern \nsea level at 5140 14C yrs BP (Yim and Huang, 2002). Further research using fixed biological \nindicators is needed from other locations of the coastline in order to constrain the amplitude of the \nmid-Holocene high stand and to better understand the effect of monsoon forcing on the RSL \nrecord. \n \n4.5 Australia \nAustralia is a tectonically stable continent far from plate margins, situated at the centre of the \nAustralian-Indian plate, and as such should preserve a sea level record dominated by eustatic \nprocesses.  Fixed biological indicators such as tubeworms, oyster beds, barnacles and corals have \nbeen used extensively along the east coast of Australia to infer Holocene sea-level movements \n(e.g., Beaman et al., 1994, Baker and Haworth, 2000, Baker et al., 2001), and foraminifera have \nbeen used to infer relative estuarine\/lagoonal and oceanic influences through the Holocene in the \nestuaries of South Australia (Cann et al. 1993, 2000a, 2000b, 2002). In the Northern Spencer Gulf \nthe highest Holocene sea levels occurred at 7000 cal years BP, followed by continuous RSL fall \nthrough the late Holocene (Cann et al. 2000a).  Studies from north New South Wales show a late \nHolocene high stand at +1.7 m at 3810 cal yrs BP (Baker et al., 2001).  However, evidence for the \n  \n11\n11\nmid-Holocene high stand in northeast Australia is much earlier, at 1.65 m above RSL between \n5660-4040 14C yrs BP in Cleveland Bay, central Great Barrier Reef (Beaman et al., 1994). \n \nThe eastern coast of Australia is affected by differential crustal flexure over late Holocene \ntimescales due to differences in the width of continental shelf and its impact on hydro-isostatic \nadjustment (Flood and Frankel, 1989; Baker et al., 2001). This affects the timing of the mid-\nHolocene high stand along the eastern Australian coast.  Fig 8 illustrates that by fitting a \npolynomial trendline through sea-level index points created from fixed biological indicators (Baker \net al. 2001) it is possible to draw the conclusion that two mid\/late-Holocene high stands have \noccurred in this region, if age and altitude errors in the reconstructions are not taken into account.   \nHowever there is little justification for choosing an episodic late Holocene sea level trend using \nmathematical modelling which does not incorporate the range of potential values for each \nage\/altitude index point. \nLarcombe et al. (1995) and Larcombe and Carter (1998) present evidence for an episodic early \nHolocene marine transgression across the central Great Barrier Reef shelf.  The most contentious \naspect is the evidence for a stillstand at \u201310 m at 8500 14C years BP, followed by a rapid fall in \nRSL to \u201317 m at 8200 14C years BP, and then a rapid rise in RSL to \u20135 m by 7800 14C years BP.     \n \nThe database used to infer this sea-level trend incorporates evidence from a wide range of studies \nover a period of 25 years, by different researchers using different proxy indicators.  The database \nmakes no attempt to reclassify indicators for the inferred sea-level position at the time the indicator \nwas lain down.  Indicators from a wide geographical area (4 degrees of latitude) are included in a \nsingle reconstruction, which would infer that differential crustal movement has not occurred over \nthis wide area during the Holocene.  Evidence from other studies (Hopley 1975, Chappell et al. \n1983) show that up to 3 m of differential movement has occurred along this coastline over the past \n6000 years.    \n4.6 Pacific Ocean \nThe Holocene RSL history of the Pacific Ocean basin is of prime importance for furthering our \nunderstanding of geoidal-eustasy, in particular Equatorial Ocean syphoning. A plethora of studies \nhave emerged in recent years from the oceanic atolls of the Pacific, most noticeably the Tahiti \ncoral record (Bard et al., 1996), and studies from Fiji, Kiribati, French Polynesia, Hawaii, Tonga, \nMarshall Islands and others (e.g., Grossman et al., 1998, Nunn and Peltier 2001). The vast \nmajority of sea-level index points from the Pacific use massive coral species (Acropora and \nPorites), coral microatolls or beachrock as indicators, which each have their own limitations. In \naddition many, if not all, of the oceanic atolls of the Pacific are subject to tectonic movements over \n  \n12\n12\nHolocene and even longer timescales. Many studies assume stability over the Holocene, \nwhereas in fact slow, constant subsidence may be occurring. Mid\/late Holocene sea-level records \nfrom the Pacific have been interpreted as evidence for a migrating geoid, through evidence of \ngreater emergence in the central ocean basin interior during the mid\/late Holocene, and most \nsignificant and recent RSL fall in the central equatorial Pacific (Mitrovica and Peltier, 1991, Nunn \nand Peltier, 2001). In addition sea-level observations indicate that oceanic atolls less than 10 km in \ndiameter are affected by hydro isostasy (Grossman et al., 1997).  \n5. Discussion \nThis review has illustrated the geographical variability of RSL reconstructions, and the variable \nquality of reconstructions across the Indo-Pacific region.  It has also shown that evidence for the \nmid-Holocene high stand is variable in both magnitude and timing across the Indo-Pacific.   In \nseveral locations limited evidence points towards a second, smaller magnitude high stand in the \nlate Holocene (Table 1).  \nField observations of mid-Holocene high stands provide essential constraints to geophysical \nmodels because model predictions of these high stands depend upon three large-scale, high \namplitude, globally applicable mechanisms: ocean syphoning caused mainly by gravitational \neffects due to the collapse of peripheral forebulges, continental levering associated with local \nocean loading, and on-going melting of global ice since the time of the high stand (magnitude and \nsource). The first two mechanisms occur throughout the deglaciation process, with the mid-\nHolocene high stand marking a point in time when the eustatic signal reduces in magnitude so that \nthese solid earth processes become apparent in the RSL record. Syphoning and continental \nlevering are dependant on the viscosity structure and, thus, contribute to the sensitivity of different \nmodels. Since syphoning produces a more geographically uniform sea-level fall than the \ncontinental levering effect, the latter is likely to account for most of the site dependent variations of \npredicted high stands. Differences between sea-level observations and predicted high stand \namplitudes are used to estimate the final mechanism; on-going melting of global ice since the time \nof the high stand (Mitrovica and Peltier 1991, Peltier, 2002, Mitrovica and Milne 2002). If the \nobservations are measured precisely, they may provide constraints on where the meltwater came \nfrom (northern or southern hemisphere), or at least the relative magnitudes. \n \nGrossman et al. (1997) propose that a second, short-lived marine transgression in low and mid \nlatitudes in the late Holocene may be due to the migration of the geoid.  The behaviour of the \nmigrating geoid might be as a series of oscillating waves flowing from its maximum position in the \ncentral ocean basin interior (the central equitorial Pacific), rather than as migration as a single \npeak.  Low and mid latitudes might experience a slight, short-lived transgression and regression \n  \n13\n13\ndue to the interplay between geoidal eustasy and hydro isostasy during the late Holocene period \nwhen glacio-eustasy has ceased.  In addition, Grossman et al. (1997) suggest that the geoidal \nanomoly may decay in the Pacific towards the Asian continent, directing a second transgression to \nthis area only.  This would fit with the evidence, which suggests that two Holocene high stands are \nonly witnessed in areas of the Indo Pacific far from the central equitorial Pacific.  However this may \njust be a coincidence considering the poor quality of the empirical data. \n \nThis review of far field locations has raised the issue that the fundamental criteria to produce an \naccurate Holocene sea-level curve are hardly ever met. The accuracy or significance of each curve \ndepends upon the number of sea level index points, the correct interpretation of its relation to the \ncorresponding mean sea level, and the quality of age determinations. There are serious problems \nassociated with the correct interpretation of the elevational relationship of the sea-level indicators \nto mean sea level. Different types of indicators have different degrees of precision, but this is often \nnot acknowledged. Coral microatolls in some settings have a much higher degree of precision than \nother species such as Porites or Acropora, which have wide elevational ranges, but each study is \nconsidered accurate to the same level. Elevation error ranges are rarely included on sea-level \ncurves. The indicative meaning and reference water level of each indicator is sometimes \naccounted for, sometimes not. Different workers assign different indicative meanings to the same \nindicator. It is common to use low tide level as a common datum rather than mean tide level, but \nthis is not often stated in reports, precluding regional correlation of different studies. \nThe second serious form of error regards age determinations, in particular the calibration of \nradiocarbon dates, a necessary process because the assumption that the specific activity of the \n14C in the atmospheric carbon dioxide has been constant is invalid. The 14C activity in the \natmosphere and other reservoirs, and thus in the initial activity of the samples dated, has varied \nover time (e.g., Stuiver et al., 1998). A calibration dataset is necessary to convert conventional \nradiocarbon ages (14C yr) into calibrated years (cal yr). However, many researchers do not \ncalibrate their radiocarbon dates, or fail to state in their publications whether they have or not. If \nages are calibrated, different researchers use different calibration programs, which use alternative \ncalibration terms and produce different results. Similar uncertainties are found with the application \nof the Marine Reservoir Effect. Radiocarbon ages of samples formed in the ocean, such as shells, \nfish, marine mammals etc., are generally several hundred years older than their terrestrial \ncounterparts. This apparent age difference is due to the large carbon reservoir of the oceans. A \ncorrection is necessary in order to compare marine and terrestrial samples, but because of \ncomplexities in ocean circulation the actual correction varies with location.  \n \n  \n14\n14\n6.  Conclusion \nThus, further sea-level analysis from far field locations must involve the application of the \nconsistent methodology to the reconstruction of sea-level history, which was first formalised during \nInternational Geological Correlation Programme (IGCP) Project 61. This operated in the period \n1979-1983, and has been a component of all subsequent IGCP Projects, especially Projects 200, \n274, 367 and 437 (e.g., van de Plassche, 1986; Shennan and Horton, 2002), however this review \nhas shown serious failings in its application. A new generation of sea-level records from far field \nlocations will improve our understanding of the driving mechanisms behind Holocene sea-level \nchange and coastal evolution over a range of spatial and temporal scales. This sea-level data \ncould be meaningfully compared with the emerging high-precision palaeoenvironmental records \nfrom the ice sheets (cores), the oceans (e.g., corals, high-resolution sediment cores) and other \nterrestrial archives (e.g., peat bogs and loess sequences). Therefore, exploration of the \nimplications of sea-level records for an understanding of existing terrestrial and oceanic records of \nHolocene environmental change, including the leads and lags associated with oceanic and \nterrestrial records (e.g., Visser et al., 2003) could occur. This provides an improved scientific \nbackground against which the role of humans as agents of coastal change can be appreciated. \n \n7.
