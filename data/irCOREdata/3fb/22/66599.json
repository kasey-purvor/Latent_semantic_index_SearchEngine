Issued in 1813, it was an instant success,\npassing through fourteen editions in three years. Readers devoured the\nstory of Leila, a fugitive Circassian slave, who was drowned by her master\nHassan and avenged by her Venetian lover, the mysterious Giaour. In this,\nthe first of his Eastern tales, Byron postures as an editor and translator of\noral poetry in the worthy tradition of Fortis, Herder, Goethe, and the less\nreputable Macpherson. Byron claims he heard the story 'recited by one of\nthe coffee-house story-tellers who abound in the Levant, and sing or recite\ntheir narratives,l This 'snake of a poem', as he lovingly called his piece,\nwas 'lengthening its rattles every month': from the compact first 1813\nversion in 344 lines, the story grew to 1334 lines in the seventh and last\nedition Byron supervised himself2 Drawing on a multipliCity of sources,\nincluding local songs, learned literature, and autobiographical moments,\nByron delivered a virtuoso performance, producing several versions of the\ntale in rapid succession.) The present study investigates Byron as editor\nand narrator of oral poetry - the form The Giaour so mischievously\nimitates - and concludes with the analysis of one particular passage of his\ntale.\nORAL POETRY AND THE PRINTED BOOK\nWith wicked imprecision, tht:: editor-translator Byron calls his tale a\n'Romaic' or 'Arnaut ditty'.4 These terms contradict each other, as 'Arnaut'\ncan mean 'Albanian' or 'Muslim', while 'Romaic' means 'modern Greek',\nbut also 'Greek Orthodox' or 'non-Muslim'; the Greeks referred to them-\nselves as Romaioi, remembering their status as Greek Orthodox members\nof the (formerly Roman) Empire. s The Greek liberation movement of\nthe nineteenth century sought to forge a historical and cultural national\nidentity which continued from ancient Greece through Byzantium.6 ByTon\nmight have had problems understanding fully either modern Greek or\n24 ROMANTICJ5M\nAlbanian, although he cultivated an interest in languages. He had studied\nclassical authors, and besides professed to 'a smattering of modern Greek\n- the Armenian &;[ Arabic Alphabets - a few Turkish &;[ Albanian phrases,\n[... ] Italian tolerably - Spanish less than tolerably - French to read with\nease - but speak with difficulty'.' Vikent RakiC's Serbo-Italian primer\nII Dialoghista Illirico-Italiano (Venice, 1810) was in his library. During his\ntravels in the East, he communicated with his guides in a wild pidgin of\nGreek, Italian and Latin 8 What Byron knew of Eastern songs and their\nculture he obtained to a large extent through fiction and historical sources,\namong them Paul Rycaut's late-seventeenth-century writings on Otto-\nman history, William Beckford's Vathel? (1786), Barthelemy d'Herbelot's\nBibliotheque Orientale (1697), or Demetrius Cantemir's standard work,\nThe HistolY oj the Growth and Decay oj the Othman Empire (English edition\n1734)9 From the late eighteenth century onwards, heroic stories from the\nEast with fatal love interest, combat and betrayal were available to Western\nreaders in translation.\nA vogue for oral poetry from Serbia and Greece had gripped Europe\nin the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. The earliest Balkan\nsource of note to reach the Western public was Andrija KaCic MiosiC's\nRazgovor Ugodni Naroda Slovinslwga, or The Pleasant Conversation oj the\nSlavic People (1756, enlarged edn 1759), a chronicle of the South Slavs\nwhich also included folk poetry. The latter often resulted from Kacic\nMiosiC's own clever compositions in the Serbian oral tradition; ignorant\nof this circumstance, translators and poets generally accepted the material\nas authentic. Works such as Saggio d'Osservazioni sopra l'Isola di Cherso\ned Osero and Viaggio in Dalmazia by Alberto Fortis (1771, 1774, English\ntranslation 1778), Clemens Werthes's Die Sitten del' Morlacl?en aus dem\nJtalienischen ubersetzt (1775) and Herder's Stimmen der Volher (1778-79)\ndrew upon it. 10 Traditional Serbian repertoire such as the celebrated 'Dirge\nof the Wife of Asan Aga' survives in versions by, among others, Herder,\nGoethe, and Walter Scott. From the eighteenth century, the performance\nof such oral repertoire was described in Western accounts. II Vuk Karadiic,\na scholar greatly appreciated by Jacob Grimm and Leopold von Ranke,\npublished his collection of Serbian folksongs in Vienna in 1814. Much\nextended in subsequent editions, it circulated in translation throughout\nWestern Europe. Claude Charles Fauriel's Chants populaires de la Grece\nbecame a great success in 1824 and was translated into English and\nGerman one year later. In 1827 Goethe published his experiments with\nGreek songs, Neugnechisch-epirotische Heldenlieder and Neugriechische\nLiebe-Sl?olien, together with his translation of a passage from Byron's Don\nJuan.\nOral PoetlY and the Printing Press in Byron's The Giaour (1813) 25\nSingers are, as field studies in the Balkans have shown, not automatic\nreproducers and transmitters of a canonic text. The length of a song may\ndiffer considerably from one performance to the next. If performers claim\nto recite a story exactly as they have heard it, they mean the plot. As Albert\nLord once put it, 'for the oral poet the moment of composition is the\nperformance'.12 Once a singer's tale has been recorded in print, the\nmoment of composition is, as it were, frozen in time. A song can, however,\ncontinue in an animated performance on paper, as the example of The\nGiaour may show.\nIt has long been observed that The Giaour rehearses conventions of\noral poetry. It celebrates the living voice: more than a third of its lines\nare delivered in direct speech. The Giaour contains ten references to\nbreathing. The tale's first line, 'No breath of air to break the wave', coming\nat a point when a storyteller would normally take a breath before diving\ninto the narrative, provides an appropriately suffocating ouverture, given\nthat the subsequent passages talk about a country which is 'living Greece\nno more' O. 91). The Giaour offers layers of conversation and communi-\ncation. In the manner of a 'clever raconteur,l3, Byron comments on the tale\nas translator and editor, while the main text itself is composed of several\nvoices. Robert Gleckner beautifully compares the work to a sculpture: we\nwill only arrive at a fuller picture once we have walked around it, taking\nin its varied shapes and shadows from all sides. Gleckner distinguishes\nbetween two narrators of the tale: a poet-traveller (not necessarily Byron),\nwho takes a larger view of present-day Greece and the human condition\nin general; and an anonymous singer who tells the story of the Venetian\ninfidel and his unfortunate lover, a story in which he himself sometimes\nis a partisan participant. 14 Through this singer, other characters either\nspeak or think - among them Hassan and his mother, a monk, a Tartar,\nand a fisherman who saw how Leila was drowned. I) At the end of the tale,\nthe Giaour himself indulges in an inordinately long dying speech which\nmakes the most of its one-man audience, a friar. '6 The singer, Jerome\nMcGann argues, avails himself of a technique used since Homer: he\nassumes as many roles as he needs, and enters into the psychology of his\ncharacters in a virtuoso performance. 17 An exemplary moment occurs\nwhen Hassan's mother waits for her son to return with his new bride. By\nthat time, as the reader knows, Hassan lies dead in the mountains:\nThe browzing camels' bells are tinkling -\nHis Mother looked from her lattice high,\nShe saw the dews of eve besprinkling\nThe pasture green beneath her eye,\n26 ROMANTICISM\nShe saw the planets faintly twinkling,\n\"Tis twilight - sure his train is nigh.' -\nShe could not rest [... J,\nBut gazed [... J -\n'Why comes he not?' (11. 689-97)\nByron draws upon a number of features known in oral poetry; for instance,\nrepetitions ('she saw' - 'she saw') and formulae (Hassan is often called\n'stern Hassan'). Such devices were familiar to contemporary readers of\nOssian and English ballads. 18 In this particular passage, the singer creates\na sense of drama by direct speech and questions. Spoken aloud, the lines\nevoke not only the elusive sounds of distant bells in the oriental evening\n('tinkling', 'sprinkling', 'twinkling'), they also give acoustic colour to the\ntwilight of the sunset and the mother's vaccillating state of mind. In a\nsynaesthetic performance, the lines combine sounds, light, and moods.\nThey develop their fullest impact in oral recitation and no doubt made a\npowerful impression at a time when poems were often read aloud to an\naudience. 19\nWith The Giaour, the tale's origins are obscured in a maze of sources and\nauthoritative voices. Byron pretends to suffer from a flawed recollection:\n'I regret that my memory has retained so few fragments of the original', he\nplayfully notes at the end of his piece20 Yet he kept adding new material\nto the tale. 'The Giaour was no sooner issued than bought up,' one reviewer\ngroaned in late 1813, 'edition trod upon the heels of edition; and before\nwe had time to determine whether we ought to review it, the fifth with\nlarge additions (we wish we could add subtractions) is laid upon our\ntable.,2l 'Were his readers to assume, as each new and augmented edition\nof his 'snake of a poem' came out, that he periodically recalled additional\nsnatches of the original lay?', McGann remarks about the strange work-\nings of Byron's memory.22 Did Byron's readership believe in an 'original\nlay'? Credulous critics thought Byron owed his story to an unforgettable\noral performance ('a recollection of the scene in which he first heard it, of\nthe impression which it made on an eastern audience, and of the grotesque\ndeclamation and gestures of the Turkish story-teller,).23 'The Turkish\noriginal of the tale,' another wrote, 'is attested [... J by the great variety\nof untranslated words which perplex the unlearned reader.' 24 Readers\nwere even instructed how to pronounce the title of the work. 25 Byron's\norientalism was also an acoustic experience, to be savoured in loud\nreading. The sounds of The Giaour in performance made it into literature,\nas in Jane Austen's Persuasion (1818):\nhaving [... J gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the\nOral Poetry and the Printing Press in Byron's The Giaour (1813) 27\nfirst-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady\noj the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and\nThe Bride oj Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pro-\nnounced, he shewed himself so intimately acquainted with all the\ntenderest songs of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions\nof hopeless agony of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous\nfeeling, the various lines which imaged a broken heart, or a mind\ndestroyed by wretchedness, and looked so entirely as if he meant to\nbe understood, that she ventured to hope he did not always read only\npoetry.26\nMelancholy Captain Benwick, the 'performer' in question, plunges so\npassionately into his declamation of The Giaour that his friend Anne Elliot\nrecommends a larger allowance of prose in his daily study.\nWhen it first appeared in print between 1813 and 1815, The Giaour\nhad all the trappings of a scrupulously edited popular song, rendered all\nthe more credible by its foreign words and 'fragmentary' nature. 27 In best\nantiquarian manner, Byron supplied lacunae where text was supposedly\nmissing. Learned footnotes (turned to endnotes in the seventh edition)\nand a line count (from the third edition) complemented the editorial\nfiction 28 Byron cared about layout - he even instructed his publisher\nMurray on minutiae such as asterisks 29 As an audible work of art, and as\na piece of print, with its verbal as well as non-verbal text, The Giaour\nconveyed the illusion of authenticity.\nByron's commentary to The Giaour sounds facetious at times - for\ninstance, when he describes the Muslim bridge to the netherworld, 'of\nbreadth less than the thread of a famished spider, over which the\nMussulmans must shate into Paradise' (note to l. 483). Such remarks\nundermine the apparent seriousness of the main text. Quite possibly\nattentive early readers realized that they were in for a joke. The Giaour has\nlong been recognized as a swipe at Robert Southey's metrical romance\nThalaba the Destroyer (1801), in which orientalist subject matter was\nheavily glossed by long-winded, ponderous annotations 30 In book eight\nof Thalaba, the gleaming fiend Oneiza emerges from her tomb, but her\n'vampire corpse' is dispatched by a timely lance before it can inflict more\nharm on the hero and the discerning reader. A nineteen-page (!) footnote\nglosses her exit with lurid ethnographic detaiU 1 Duly following his model,\nByron not only includes a vampire scene in The Giaour but, like Southey,\nexplanatory notes. These acknowledge 'the note on Thalaba' as a source\n('the stories told in Hungary and Greece of these foul feeders are Singular,\nand some of them most incredibly attested') 32\n28 ROMANTICISM\nByron's oriental fantasy is, however, not to be understood as a response\nto merely one individual work since it follows other literary projects of\nthe period which cultivated personalized idiosyncratic notes. The Giaour\nappeared in the shadows of another of Byron's annotated poetical com-\npositions, the wildly successful Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, a collage of\nautobiography, travelogue, lyrical setting and antiquarian interest.\nCharacteristically, Murray placed advertisements of Chi\/de Harold in issues\nof The Giaour which stressed the hybrid nature of the work:\nChilde Harold's Pilgrimage: A Romaunt: written during the Author's\nTravels in Portugal, Spain, Albania, and some of the most interesting\nParts of Greece; with Notes. To which are added, a few miscellaneous\nPoems, and Translations of modern Greek Songs, written chiefly\nabroad: and a short Appendix, containing Observations on modern\nGreek Literature, with a short Catalogue of Romaic Authors. 33\nByron's Eastern tales mimic a genre of the period which might be defined\nas 'antiquarian verse narrative'. Here, a text rehearses historical occur-\nrences, legends, folktales and the like, and supplements them with a\nsubstantial commentary. Many early readers shelved The Giaour in this\ncategory, as can be inferred from contemporary anthologies. Byron's tales\nwere initially sold as octavos in unassuming drab wrappers. Often,\nhowever, buyers had them bound with other 'related' works, such as the\nverse narratives The Battles of Talavera by J.W. Croker, W. Drennan's\nGlendalloch, and The Legend of Cathleen and Kevin, a work of 'poetical' as\nmuch as 'antiquarian' merit (The Legend of Cathleen and Kevin boasted\nfoot- and endnotes)3-lln this hybrid genre, verse and circumstantial infor-\nmation were equally important. Notes proved indispensable for the under-\nstanding of the past-in-poetry. As Byron's contemporary Goethe observed,\n'the reader who on dear old ancients dotes, knows that he needs good\nglosses, and wants notes. The moderns seem far easier, far straighter. Yet\nthey too need a talented translator.'35 This also applied to an antiquarian\nspoof such as The Giaour. Early foreign-language versions of the tale\nincluded not only Byron's verses but his notes 36 Byron was very keen on\nhaving his notes reviewed, and, as editions went by, alerted his reviewers\nto changes in the margins.3? As the distancing explanatory device of a\n'talented translator' (to use Goethe's term), Byron's commentary to The\nGiaour supplies sane, funny prose. It works as an anti-dote on doting\nreaders who are, like poor Captain Benwick, carried away by the im-\nmediacy of seemingly straight oral poetry. Unfortunately, these notes\nhave been pruned from certain current editions or banned to the editorial\napparatus as if they were an irrelevant paratext.38 A whole communicative\nOral Poetry and the Printing Press in Byron~ The Giaour (1813) 29\ndimension of Byron's oeuvre is thereby lost to many modern readers.\nAntiquarian-poets in Byron's days navigated between critical editing\nand free composition, enjoying the licence to change, digress, or reduce.\nAs in oral repertoire (which often provided their subject matter), their\ncreativity was not restricted by the notion of a finite text. According to\nan early critic of The Giaour, Byron had 'not confined himself, either to the\nincidents, or to the catastrophe, of the original tale; but has given full\nscope to his own fertile imagination,.39 Indeed one admirer applauded\nByron's licentious editing: by omitting 'the many inSipid ingredients which\nswelled the redundant narratives of our ancestors', Byron had managed to\n'reduce' his composition 'to its quintessence'.~o Fragments were reader-\nfriendly, another critic argued, as 'the greater part of polite readers would\nnow no more think of sitting down to a whole Epic, than to a whole OX,.~I\nApparently, readers did not worry whether The Giaour adequately rep-\nresented an 'original lay'. (If they wanted original lays, they could always\nrecur to the appendix of Chi\/de Harold, where Byron cited actual Greek\npoems instead of faking them in an amusing pastiche.)\nIf Byron was free to dwell on essentials, he was also at liberty to add\naccording to personal taste and the wishes of his readers. His friend and\ncritic Francis Hodgson made the author alter the last lines of The Giaour:\nThe last lines Hodgson likes - &: it is not often he does - &: when he\ndon't [sic] - he tells me with great energy - &: then I fret &: alter - I\nhave thrown them in to soften the ferocity of our lnfidel - &: for a\ndying man have given him a good deal to say for himself-.~2\nIn May 1813, the poet lived a few minutes' walk from his publisher's offices\nin Albemarle Street, London, and frequently dropped by to implement\nchanges.~3 'Dear Sir,' Byron wrote to Murray in summer 1813, 'can you\nkeep the proofs standing a day for the G[iaourp if so - I will send you a\nfew more lines -'.~~ As Byron's working routine for The Giaour attests,\nprinting was part of the writing process, and writing in turn drew upon\naudience feedback.~5In lengthening the rattles of his tale, the editor Byron\nclaims the privileges of the singer Byron. Always a compulsive reviser of\nhis own work, Byron acts as any good performer would: he extends and\ndigresses with verses - and notes - to prolong the pleasure of his appre-\nciative audience. Over 12,000 copies of The Giaour in the first thirteen\neditions~6 show that readers - or listeners - impatiently demanded an\nencore.\n30 ROMANTICISM\nTHE CURSE\nLike telling a story, cursing is an oral performance which thrives upon an\naudience. It is an excellent dramatic device, as in Shakespeare's Richard III,\nwhere Richard mocks yet fears Queen Margaret's powerful curses. A\nhaunting speech, still missing in the first fair manuscript copy of The\nGiaour, appeared in a first printed edition which had been struck off for\nprivate circulation. Here, Byron was, in the opinion of a contemporary\ncritic, 'banquetting [... J to surfeit on the imagined terrors of the grave'.\nWith 'the strange and sickening superstition of the Vampyre', Byron had\nchosen 'a subject totally unfit for the poetical canvass'.47 The infamous\nlines occur when the Giaour has killed Hassan in combat and is cursed in\nreturn (11. 747-86). Although they address the Giaour in the second\nperson, they are not delivered in direct speech (quotation marks sign-\nposted every line of direct speech in the 1813-15 editions). They voice\nmost likely the singer's mood, who at this point allows himself to be drawn\ninto the story:\nBut first, on earth as Vampire sent,\nThy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\nThen ghastly haunt thy native place,\nAnd suck the blood of all thy race,\nThere from thy daughter, sister, wife,\nAt midnight drain the stream of life;\nYet loathe the banquet which perforce\nMust feed thy livid living corse [... J. (II. 755-62)\nMay the Giaour live forever and feed upon his kind? As Peter Thorslev\nobserves, this 'Mohammedan curse' invests the hero with wife and daugh-\nter 'when so far as the poem shows, he has neither' (p. 9). The hammed-\nup speech pokes fun at the antiquarian horror of Thalaba the Destroyer.\nByron's vampires instil fear by exquisite bad taste, as other satirical poems\ndating back to the composition of The GiaoLlr show. 48\nWithin the tale, the vampire curse is traditionally seen as an expression\nof religious antagonism, a 'Mohammedan' invective against the Christian\nenemy.-l9 Attempts to uncover the religious politics of The Giaour have not\nbeen lacking. Marilyn Butler regards the work as an allegory on the British\nEmpire: written in the year Parliament endorsed missionary work in India,\nThe Giaour questions empire-building by religion. In Butler's account, the\nnarrative is dominated by the representatives of two 'imperial' religions:\nlslam and proselytising Christianity. Christian European powers intended\nto '''liberate'' their Greek co-religionists from the Turks', a project which\nOral Poetry and the P,inting Press in Byron~ The Giaour (1813) 31\nByron's tale unmasks as the exchange of 'one alien despotism for\nanother,.50 Byron's tale begins with a historical 'Advertisement'. It alludes\nto the 1770s, when Turks, Greeks, Albanians, Venetians and Russians\nviolently fought over territory, with changing coalitions and uncertain\nresults. Russia had encouraged a Greek revolt, but with many Greeks\nfailing to fight and insufficient Russian reinforcements, the initiative\nfoundered in horrible massacres. 51 In the Balkans and the Levant of the\neighteenth century, theological frontlines had evolved along military and\ncultural ones. Katie MiosiC's collection of pseudo-oral poetry was\ncomposed in a Franciscan convent and dedicated to the Bishop of Kortula.\nThe second edition of Razgovor (1759) was offered to a local prince whose\nfamily was praised for its long history of fighting against the 'Ottoman\nbarbars'. Katie Miosie expressed the hope that his heroic stories and songs\nwould foster resilience against Muslim dominance. Significantly, his work\nwas approved by the Inquisitor of the Holy Office in Venice, who found\n'nothing against the holy Catholic faith' in it, and was recommended for\ncirculation in the public libraries of Venice and Padua. 52\nWhile Butler's argument for religion as a political tool is substantiated\nby the way ideological and territorial war zones were mapped out in the\nEast of the eighteenth century, a unified, anti-Ottoman Christian liber-\nation movement did not exist. As early as the seventeenth century, Paul\nRycaut's authoritative book The Present State oj the Greeh and Armenian\nChurches (1679) - a work Byron might have read - devotes a full chapter\nto the struggle between Catholic, Orthodox and Muslim forces for\nreligious influence in the Greek Archipelago; all sides are uncharitably\nportrayed as exploiting local communities.53 Christian groups contended\namong each other for influence in the lands of the Ottoman Empire. The\nGreek Orthodox community was co-ordinated by the Phanariots, a Greek\nupper class of Constantinople residents who provided the Patriarch.\nHaving made very comfortable arrangements with Ottoman authorities,\nthey had no intention of collaborating with their so-called Christian co-\nreligionists. The Orthodox church itself was split between the Phanariot\nregime, campaigns for local independence, a reform movement orches-\ntrated by Austria, and a pan-Slavic initiative masterminded by Russia. 54\nRussia had long projected the restoration of a Byzantine Empire, ruled\nunder Russian guidance from an Orthodox Constantinople. In prepar-\nation, Catherine the Great had her aptly named grandson Constantine\ntutored in Greek and groomed for the office of Byzantine Emperor.\nRelations with the Catholic church were cool. The Patriarch of Con-\nstantinople regularly anathematized the Pope, for instance, in 1722, for\nwearing shoes embroidered with a crosS. 55 Excommunication was a\n32 ROMANTICISM\npreferred instrument used by Church authorities to enforce civic obedi-\nence. At the outbreak of the Greek revolt in 1821, Patriarch Gregorios of\nConstantinople solemnly excommunicated all rebels and called upon his\nsubjects to return to the Ottoman fold (nonetheless the Sublime Porte had\nhim hanged for treason).56 Anathema as a Greek feature was discussed by\nhistorians and travellers, such as Byron's source Tournefort. It became a\nliterary trope, for instance, in Shelley's lyrical drama Hellas (821) and\nProsper Merimee's spoof collection La Guzla (827).57 The Greek fear of\ndamnation still represents a powerful political weapon - as late as 2004,\nBishop Pavlos of Kyrenia warned his fiock that they would be damned\nif they approved the UN plan for the reunification of CypruS. 58 In this\nhistorical context, it seems worthwhile to investigate cursing as an\nelement of religious contest buttressed by official authority.\nGreek Orthodox anathema - a ban from the religious community\nwhich, in its most severe form, means the damnation of the person\naffected - had a powerful social dimension. It could be pronounced not\nonly on individuals but a group. During the Ottoman period entire villages\ncould be cursed by decree, for instance, to ensure that cattle thieves\nwere denounced to the authorities. Until modern times, the ceremony was\nperformed in public with black vestments, candles, troparia about Judas,\nand formal speeches; it was even possible to curse the dead. 59 The sentence\nwas a collective act: the community of the faithful confirmed the verdict\nby shouting 'Amen' or (in the Latin rite) 'fiat'. The ceremony might include\nelements of the service for the dying or defunct - in this manner, the\nvictim was, effectively, turned into a dead person 60 While Latin rites\nproclaimed the living as dead, the dead were almost alive in Greek\nOrthodox ones. The Eastern church promoted the view that the bodies of\nthe damned would not decay.61 (Damned were, preferably, members of\nother faiths such as the Catholics.62) The idea of incorruptible material evil\nwas founded upon a particular interpretation of the gospel of Mark and\nMatthew, which in turn derived from Isaiah 66.24:\nAnd they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that\nhave transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither\nshall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all\nfiesh. 63\nThis special feature of Greek Orthodox doctrine was well-known in the\nWest as early as the seventeenth century. The Present State discussed it at\nlength and even included an excommunication formula in the original\nGreek. In Rycaut's translation, the sentence has not lost its fiavour,\npronouncing everlasting corporeality in awesome detail:\nOral Poetry and the Plinting Press in Byron~ The Giaour (1813) 33\nlet him be separated from the Lord God Creatour, and be accursed,\nand unpardoned, and undissolvable after death in this World, and in\nthe other which is to come. Let Wood, Stones, and Iron be dissolved,\nbut not they: May they inherit the Leprosie of Gehazi, and the Con-\nfusion of Judas; may the Earth be divided, and devour them like\nDathan and Abiram; may they sigh and tremble on earth like Cain,\n[... J may they have the Curses of the holy and righteous Patriarchs\nAbram, Isaac andJacob; of the 318 Saints who were the Divine Fathers\nof the Synod of fice; and of all other holy Synods; and being without\nthe Church of Christ, let no man administer unto them the things of\nthe Church, or bless them, or offer Sacrifice for them, [... Jor eat, or\ndrink, or work with them, or converse with them; and after death,\nlet no man bury them, in penalty of being under the same state of\nExcommunication [... ]6-1\nRycaut regales his readers with bizarre Greek tales about halted and accel-\nerated corruption as a consequence of the curse. Thus, an unfortunate\nvillager from the Morea had died under excommunication. Suspected of\nhaving turned into a vampire, he was dug up again; the body was found\nsuspiciously intact, boiled in wine, and laid out in the local church. The\ncommunity beseeched the Patriarch of Constantinople to lift the ban on\nthe defunct. Finally a merciful letter arrived. As soon as the pardon was\npronounced, the coffin rumbled and the body instantly dissolved as if it\nhad lain interred for seven years! Unimpressed by the story, Rycaut\nconcluded that the Orthodox church encouraged superstition to rake in\nmoney for their impoverished clergy65 The idea of a demonic body\nconflicted with the Christian notion of saintly incorruptibility. 1t became\na symbol of religious difference within Christianity. In his Dictionnaire\nPhilosophique (1789), Voltaire traced the origins of vampire legends in a\nschismatic modern Greece, where Orthodox Greeks regarded Romar,\nCatholics as excommunicated sinners whose bodies would not decay.66\nTo return to The Giaour. Its genesis leads us to faiths in conflict as much\nas to battling nationalities. Indeed the title of the tale is pure damnation.\n'Giaour' means 'infidel', somebody excluded from a religious community.\nIn oral practice, the name becomes an apostrophe of exclusion: 'giaour\nIzmir', for instance, means 'infidel Izmir' - a curse on a Turkish coastal\ncity \\-vith a large population of non-Muslim foreigners. of Byron's 'Romaic'\nor 'Arnaut' ditty can, we remember, be understood in both ethnic and\nreligious terms. From his enemy's 'Arnaut garb' Hassan does not guess that\nthe Giaour has chosen the Albanian nationality but that he is 'apostate\nfrom his own vile faith' (II. 615-16). Interestingly, Hassan's religious\n34 ROMANTICISM\ncredentials too emerge from what he wears. He is identified as 'an Emir by\nhis garb of green' (1. 357). The garment not only signposts him as a Turk;\nits colour was traditionally reserved to old families who traced their\nlineage back to Mohammed, as Byron's note to that line points OUt. 68 The\nvampire curse is framed by passages expressing religious antagonism.\nFirst, the singer evokes with loud prayer ('AlIa Hu!') a Muslim paradise\nwhere celestial maids 'welcome with a kiss the brave' I Who falls in battle\n'gainst a Giaour' (ll. 734, 744-5). What follows is not a 'Mohammedan\ncurse', pace Thorslev, but an invocation which mingles Greek Orthodox\ndoctrine with an Islamic vision of hell (Byron even adds a pun on\n'orthodox' in his notes on the curse).69 The curse is truly the speech-act of\na ditty both 'Romaic' and 'Arnaut'.\nThe Giaour's religious orientation appears even more confusing than\nthat of the harangue visited upon him - one of the reasons why contem-\nporary reviewers complained that Byron was 'too negligent [... ] in his\nproductions of [... J Christian principles,.70 Why the Giaour, an apostate\nof Venetian origins, would spend his last days in what appears to be, of all\nplaces, a Catholic convent remains a mystery. He is called a 'lone Caloyer',\nand indeed in his long-haired appearance he resembles a type of un-\ngroomed Greek monk. 7J His dying speech (11. 971-1328) has variously\nbeen regarded as an example of Calvinist introspection or confession, but\nit also mentions Allah (1. 1133)n As if excommunicated and damned, he\npredicts that he will turn into 'that lifeless thing the living fear'; further-\nmore, he shuns common meals and conversation, and compares himself\nto Cain (II. 1280, 1058). He does not mind a cross on his grave (I. 1325)\nbut refuses the sacraments (this part, much extended in the seventh\nedition, disturbed Adam Mickiewicz so much that he expurgated it in his\n1834 translation). 73\nByron looked coldly upon the business of religion. 'I abhor Religion,\nthough I reverence & love my God,' he noted in 1807.74 In a draft of his\nCatholic emancipation speeches in 1812\/13, he mentioned the ruinous\ndispute between the Latin and Greek churches during the siege of\nConstantinople, which contributed to the fall of the city.75 A few years\nlater, he wrote, 'when I was in Turkey I was oftener tempted to turn\nMussulman than poet, & have often regretted since that I did not'.76 The\nreligions displayed in The Giaour are, as Butler has so convincingly argued,\ninterchangeable in their ruthless quest for domination. Given the various\nMuslim and Christian (in particular, Greek-Orthodox) elements in the\ntext, the issue is not a struggle between Christendom and Islam but the\ndevastating effect religions of whatsoever colour may have on a com-\nmunity. The main protagonist's convictions remain uncertain: he finds rest\nOral Poetry and the Printing Press in Byron's The Giaour (1813) 35\nneither in 'Amaut garb' nor in the convent. Faith offers cold comfort.\n'Blest' was the Giaour while Leila lived - now he cares not for the bless-\nings of the church (ll. 1115, 1269). 'Blessed' are the Greek isles, but, like\nLeila, their 'deadly fair' beauty is 'hovering round decay' (ll. 8,92,99). As\nthe poet-narrator laments in his dirge on Greece, 'Hers is the loveliness in\ndeath,IThat parts not quite with parting breath' (II. 94-5). A beautiful\ncorpse on the brink of corruption, Greece has lost her voice. More vocal\nare the forces which brought about destruction, elbowing each other out\nof the narrative in The Giaour, cursing each other. 'Cursed' are those with\nselfish designs on beauty: 'the tyrants that destroy', murderous Hassan,\nwhose desolate tomb is overgrown by weeds, and the Giaour, who walks\nthe earth as a living dead77 With such champions, Greece may wait long\nfor her resurrection.\n* * *\nKatie Miosie once ruefully remarked about the folklore of his people that\nit lacked variety:\nThese songs will not be to everyone's taste, for there is little variation\namong them, all of them containing the same words, such as: hero,\nImight, horseman, galley slave, serpent, dragon, wolf, lion,falcon, eagle,\nfalcon's nest and sword, sabres, lances, Kraljevic, Kobilic, Zdrinovic,\nnecldets, medallions, decrees, heads chopped off, slaves can-ied away,\netc. May those who find them pleasing sing them; may those who do\nnot, go off to sleep.'s\nFar from rehearsing monotonous tropes of the East, Byron's oriental in-\nspiration galvanized its audience. Byron celebrated the singer's voice in the\nprint medium. Animated by moveable type, The Giaour is truly told on a\n'living page' (I. 126) which ever proliferates. The tale breathes as if it were\nan organism, gathering its forces for the next accretion. Byron playfully\nestablishes a conversation between audience, editor-translator, narrators,\nsources, and the many voices within the tale. Most of the time these voices\nare locked into an inextricably hostile embrace, exemplifying the battle-\nground Greece has become. In tune with historical circumstance, The\nGiaour evokes religions in contest, each destructive in a will to dominate,\nnone winning in the end. Time-honoured story-telling tricks tease readers\nto lend their voices to this struggle, and tum verses about doomed passion\nand sensational superstition into spoken word again. But The Giaour\nencourages switching between two levels of enjoying the tale_ 'While its\npoetry seduces us into emotional involvement, the notes are best savoured\nin silent reading. Their dry irony encourages detached reflection. Byron\n36 ROMANTICISM\nchose an exceptional departure from the over-enthusiastic heroic mode\nadopted by so many contemporary neo-Hellenic poems (as Goethe criti-\ncized such works, 'strike him dead I Strike him dead! Bring the laurels!\nBlood I Blood! [... J That's no poetry yet'). 79 Byron's editorial ruse estab-\nlishes a balance between a passionate Hellenic vision in the poetry and\nan understanding that this vision may remain an unattainable ideal in\nthe prose. Such subtlety lifts Byron's Eastern song more than a notch\nabove Southey's purple orientalism. The Giaour refreshingly refrains from\nnationalism as it was sometimes flaunted in other collections of (pseudo)-\noral poetry during the eighteenth and early nineteenth century. A singer\nin the times of print culture, Byron used the printing press as an instru-\nment to playa polyphonic score. It is high time to restore Byron the\neditor, translator and commentator to the concert of voices on his living\npage. ~\nDepartment of English Studies\nUniversity of Durham\nOTES\n1.
