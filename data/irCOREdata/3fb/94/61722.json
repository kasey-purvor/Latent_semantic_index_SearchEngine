Boakes (P.Boakes@ion.le.ac.uk) \n \nAbstract. \n \nA statistical comparison of the latitude of the open\/closed magnetic field line \nboundary (OCB) as estimated from the three far ultraviolet (FUV) detectors onboard \nthe IMAGE spacecraft [the Wideband Imaging camera, WIC, and the Spectrographic \nImagers, SI-12 and SI-13] has been carried out over all magnetic local times. A total \nof over 400000 OCB estimations were compared from December 2000 and January \nand December of 2001-2002. The modal latitude difference between the FUV OCB \nproxies from the three detectors is small, < 1\u00b0, except in the predawn and evening \nsectors, where the SI-12 OCB proxy is found to be displaced from both the SI-13 and \nWIC OCB proxies by up to 2\u00b0 poleward in the predawn sector and by up to 2\u00b0 \nequatorward in the evening sector. Comparing the IMAGE FUV OCB proxies with \nthat determined from particle precipitation measurements by the Defense \nMeteorological Satellites Program (DMSP) also shows systematic differences. The \nSI-12 OCB proxy is found to be at higher latitudes in the predawn sector, in better \nagreement with the DMSP OCB proxy. The WIC and SI-13 OCB proxies are found to \nbe in better agreement with the DMSP OCB proxy at most other magnetic local times. \nThese systematic offsets may be used to correct FUV OCB proxies to give a more \naccurate estimate of the OCB latitude. \n \nKey Words. Magnetospheric physics (auroral phenomena; Instruments and \ntechniques). Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere). \n \n1 Introduction \n \nNew insights into the physics of magnetic reconnection, including its continuity, \nextent and controlling factors, have been provided by remote measurements of the \nglobal and local magnetic reconnection rate in the magnetospheric system (Chisham \net al., 2008, and references therein). Such remote sensing requires the accurate \ndetermination of the boundary in the ionosphere between magnetic field lines of open \nand closed topology. \n \nMany different ionospheric measurements may be employed to determine the location \nof the open\/closed field magnetic field line boundary (OCB) in the ionosphere. These \n 1\ninclude optical measurements from all-sky cameras, imaging spacecraft and meridian-\nscanning photometers (Blanchard et al., 1995; Blanchard et al., 1997; Sandholt et al., \n1998; Brittnacher et al., 1999), particle precipitation signatures from low-altitude \nspacecraft (Newell et al., 1991; Newell et al., 1996; Sotirelis and Newell, 2000) and \nmeasurements from incoherent and coherent scatter radars (Baker et al., 1995; \nBlanchard et al., 1996; Milan et al., 1999; Blanchard et al., 2001; Chisham et al., \n2001; Lester et al., 2001; Chisham et al., 2002; Chisham and Freeman, 2003), or a \ncombination of all of these (Milan et al., 2003). Unfortunately, most of these \nmeasurements suffer from only partial coverage of the auroral oval at any one time, \nmaking a global determination of the OCB difficult. Particle precipitation boundaries \n(PPB) measured by low-altitude spacecraft (such as the Defence Meteorological \nSatellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft) provide the most direct and precise \ndetermination of boundaries between different plasma regions, including the OCB. \nHowever, these spacecraft only cross the OCB in two magnetic local time (MLT) \nsectors in each hemisphere in any one orbit (~100 minutes for the DMSP satellite) and \ntherefore can not be used to determine the global location of the OCB. \n \nCurrently the best method for estimating the global location of the OCB is from \nimages of the aurora taken by satellites. However, recent studies have shown that \nthere are systematic differences of up to a few degrees between the latitude of the \nboundaries determined from auroral images and the in-situ particle precipitation \nmeasurements (Kauristie et al., 1999; Baker et al., 2000; Carbary et al., 2003). \nCarbary et al. (2003) studied the statistical discrepancy between the DMSP OCB \nproxy and an OCB proxy derived from auroral images taken in the Lyman-Birge-\nHopfield \u201clong\u201d (LBHL) band (164-178 nm) by the Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI) on the \nPolar spacecraft. They showed that the largest discrepancy occurs in the predawn \nsector ionosphere, with DMSP proxies found up to ~ 3.5\u00b0 poleward of UVI proxies at \n0500 MLT. A very similar discrepancy was found in the predawn sector ionosphere \nby Chisham et al. (2005), comparing the DMSP OCB proxy with an OCB proxy \nprovided by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) Spectral Width \nBoundary (SWB). Wild et al. (2004) presented a case study in which the latitudes of \nboth the SWB OCB proxy and the OCB estimated using the Wideband Imaging \nCamera (WIC) (140-160 nm) onboard the IMAGE spacecraft were placed several \ndegrees equatorward of the OCB PPB proxies determined from Cluster, DMSP and \nFAST spacecraft measurements obtained simultaneously in the predawn sector. \nHowever they showed that the OCB determined from the Spectrographic Imager SI-\n13 (~133-138 nm) on board IMAGE was closely co-located with the OCB PPB \nproxies. They concluded that in the dawn sector ionosphere the SWB and the \npoleward boundary of auroral emissions measured by WIC were unreliable proxies \nfor the OCB in this case, with the poleward boundary of SI-13 emissions providing a \nmore accurate proxy. Other studies have used the poleward boundary of SI-12 auroral \nemission (~119-124 nm) in preference to WIC or SI-13 OCB proxies due to the \nreduced level of dayglow, making boundary estimation possible even in summer \nmonths (Hubert et al., 2006). However, these studies did not consider if SI-12 gave \nthe most reliable estimation of the OCB location. Using IMAGE FUV data, Mende et \nal. [2003] also noted that the proton aurora was found to be displaced equatorward of \nthe electron aurora for dusk local times and poleward for dawn local times during all \nphases of substorms. \n \n 2\nIn this paper we compare, statistically, the magnetic latitude of the OCB as estimated \nfrom auroral images from the WIC, SI-12 and SI-13 Far Ultra-Violet (FUV) detectors \nonboard the IMAGE satellite (FUV OCB proxies) and from DMSP particle \nprecipitation measurements (DMSP OCB proxy). In section two we set out the \nmethod of FUV OCB estimation using a modified method of Carbary et al. (2003) and \ncompare the FUV OCB proxies. In section three we compare the FUV OCB proxies \nwith the DMSP OCB proxy. We discuss these results and their implications for \naccurately estimating the latitude of the OCB at all magnetic local times in section 4, \nand finally we summarise our findings in section 5. \n \n2 Comparison between IMAGE FUV OCB proxies \n \nThe FUV imager onboard the IMAGE satellite (Mende et al., 2000a; Mende et al., \n2000b) consists of three detectors observing the aurora with a temporal resolution of \ntwo minutes (limited by the spin period of the spacecraft). The Wideband Imaging \nCamera (WIC) has a bandwidth of 140-180 nm, observing emissions from the N2 \nLyman-Birge-Hopfield band and atomic NI lines. The Spectrographic Imager SI-12 \nobserves the proton aurora with a pass band of 5 nm centered on the 121.82 nm \nDoppler-shifted Lyman-\u03b1 and the SI-13 detector observes the \u2018excited electron \naurora\u2019 with a pass band of 5 nm centered on the 135.6 nm OI doublet. WIC offers the \nbest spatial resolution of approximately 50 km at apogee, compared to approximately \n100 km offered by both spectrographic imagers. IMAGE was operational from May \n2000 to December 2005, when the spacecraft failed. In this study we use data from \nDecember 2000 and January and December of 2001 and 2002. After this date the \ncamera pointing became less reliable such that the position of the auroral oval may be \noffset from its true position by up to 1\u00b0 of latitude. We only use images from \nDecember and January as dayglow is much less prominent in these months; whilst in \nother months dayglow often swamps the dayside auroral oval, particularly in the WIC \ndata, making the estimation of the dayside OCB latitude impossible. \n \n2.1 Identification of IMAGE FUV OCB proxies \n \nIntensity-latitude profiles of the auroral oval are created by averaging the FUV \nintensities in bins of one degree of magnetic latitude and one hour of MLT. Examples \nof intensity-latitude profiles are shown in Figure 1 (a-c), where the binned data are \nrepresented by diamonds. \n \nWe use a modification of the method of Carbary et al. (2003) (hereafter called the \nFUV OCB estimation method) to estimate the location of the OCB in each 1 h MLT \nsector. This method involves fitting a Gaussian function plus a quadratic background \nto the intensity-latitude profiles from a single 1 h MLT sector. Although the method \nof Carbary et al. (2003) was developed using data from the Polar Ultraviolet Imager, \nLam et al. (2006) have shown that the same method can be successfully applied to \nother auroral imagers. \n \nThe solid curves in Figure 1 (a-c) represent a fit to the binned data using a non-linear \nleast-square fit (using the IDL Gaussfit routine) to the following function: \n \n 3\n2\n543\n2\n2\n1\n0 2\n1exp)( \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb AAA\nA\nAAT +++\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212=  (1) \n \nwhere \u03bb  is the magnetic latitude and A0-A5 are coefficients of the fit. The Gaussian \npart of (1) is assumed to represent the auroral oval and the quadratic background is \nassumed to include extraneous airglow, off-axis radiance, or unwanted non-oval \naurora. A fit is assumed to be successful if the following criteria are satisfied: \n1. The intensity of the Gaussian, A0, exceeds 5 counts (we use corrected counts \nfrom the IMAGE data, where corrections for flatfield, gain of the MCP etc \nhave been applied so that one Rayleigh of emission always produces the same \nnumber of counts wherever in the CCD). \n2. The magnetic latitude of the peak of the Gaussian, A1, is between 50\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 \nmagnetic latitude. \n3. The Gaussian FWHM ( 2ln22 2A=\u0394\u03bb  ) exceeds 1\u00b0. \n4. The ratio of the background at the center of the Gaussian \n(  ) to the peak of the Gaussian, A215143 .. AAAAAB ++= 0, does not exceed \n0.2. \n5. )(3.0 minmax \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb \u2212<\u0394 The Gaussian width spans less than 30% of the latitude \nbins which have non-zero intensity. \n \nThe latitude of the OCB, OCB\u03bb  (shown by the vertical lines in Figure 1 (a-c) and \noverplotted on the auroral images (Figure 1 (d-f)) by diamonds), is assumed to be \ndisplaced poleward of the centre of the auroral oval by the Gaussian FWHM such that \n \n\u03bb\u03bb \u0394+= 1AOCB  (2) \n \nBy visually inspecting the data we note that on occasion the FUV OCB estimation \nmethod produces a latitude profile meeting the given criteria above but which results \nin an apparently inaccurate boundary estimation (displaced several degrees in latitude \nfrom the location estimated by eye). We have identified two particular reasons why \nthese errors occur and correct as follows: \n(1) The auroral oval can often display a double oval configuration {{20 \nElphinstone,R.D. 1996; }} causing the intensity-latitude profiles to have a multiple \npeaked nature with two or more Gaussian like components. Normally the Gaussian \nfitting procedure will fit to the most equatorward peak and include the more poleward \npeaks in the quadratic background part of the fit. To find the most accurate location of \nthe OCB we must include these more poleward peaks in the Gaussian part of the fit. \nWe do this by searching for the most poleward peak meeting the criteria 1-5 as \nfollows. The intensity-latitude profile must decrease in intensity over at least two \ndegrees of magnetic latitude in the poleward direction from the latitude of the last \npeak found, followed by an increase over at least two degrees of latitude. Once a new \nmaximum in intensity is found the intensity must decrease again over at least two \ndegrees of magnetic latitude. The Gaussian fitting procedure is then applied to the \nmost poleward peak identified below 85\u00b0 magnetic latitude by including only latitudes \nmore poleward of the minimum between the most poleward peak and the previous \npeak in the fitting routine. This will also effectively remove dayglow from intensity-\n 4\nlatitude profiles when a clear drop in intensity exists between the poleward edge of \ndayglow and the equatorward edge of the auroral oval. \n(2) Dayglow often extends close to or onto the auroral oval, often completely \nswamping it in the summer months. The poisson noise associated with the dayglow \ncan be larger than the auroral signature itself. In most cases the criteria 1-5 reject any \nidentification of the OCB. However occasionally this is not the case and the Gaussian \nfunction is fit to the dayglow emission rather than the auroral oval emission, placing \nthe OCB estimate at the poleward edge of the dayglow, as seen at 1100-1200 MLT in \nFigure 1 (f). Extra criteria are used to try and eliminate these cases as follows. On the \ndayside (0600-1800 MLT) we reject an OCB proxy if it has been placed over five \ndegrees poleward or equatorward of the proxy found in the previous MLT sector. If \nthe previous MLT sector has not produced a proxy we use the next earlier MLT. If \nthis has also not produced a proxy the MLT sector tested is rejected. \n \nIf an OCB proxy has not been identified by this point, in a bid to remove dayglow \nfrom the fit, we shift the lower limit of the latitudes included when creating the \nintensity-latitude profiles to higher latitudes in steps of one degree until an estimation \nof the OCB can be found (by reapplying all the above FUV OCB estimation method) \nup to a maximum latitude lower limit of 80\u00b0. A similar correction as above is applied \non the nightside, 0000-0600 MLT and 1800-2400 MLT, if the OCB is located over 8\u00b0 \npoleward or equatorward of adjacent MLTs. The larger value on the nightside is used \nas we find (from visual inspection) that the latitude of the OCB can legitimately \nchange by between 5-8 degrees, particularly around the auroral bulge where at \nsubstorm onset the latitude of the OCB is rapidly changing.  \n \nThese extra criteria remove many erroneous OCB estimations. However, we can not \ncatch all bad estimations, as seen in Figure 1 (f) 1100-1200 MLT, where the OCB \nproxy is placed equatorward of the poleward edge of the WIC auroral emission but is \njust within the five degree condition. These criteria will also not catch poorly \nestimated OCB proxies if several poorly estimated proxies have been made in several \nadjacent MLT bins. \n \n2.2 Comparison between FUV detectors \n \nWe apply the FUV OCB estimation method to every FUV auroral image obtained by \nIMAGE from the months of December 2000 and December and January 2001-2002. \nComparing FUV OCB proxies from different cameras at the same UT and MLT gives \na total of 471112 comparisons between WIC and SI-12 OCB proxies, 490039 \ncomparisons between WIC and SI-13 OCB proxies and 397365 comparisons between \nSI-12 and SI-13 OCB proxies, and over 4000 comparisons in each hour MLT bin. \n \nLet us define the latitude of WIC, SI-12 and SI-13 OCB proxies as \u03bbWIC, \u03bbSI-12 and \u03bbSI-\n13 respectively. Figure 2 shows distributions of the latitude differences between \nmatched WIC and SI-12 OCB proxies (\u03bbWIC,- \u03bbSI-12) for four 1-hour MLT bins. \nPositive values of latitude difference are defined such that the WIC OCB proxy is at \nhigher latitudes than the SI-12 OCB proxy. Crosses in Figure 2 represent the number \nof occurrences of latitude differences between WIC and SI-12 OCB proxies in bins of \n0.2\u00b0 magnetic latitude. In order to reduce small statistical uncertainty smoothing has \nbeen applied to the distributions three times using boxcar averaging over five points. \n 5\nLarge boundary differences can be seen in the tails of these distributions. Visual \ninspection of these points shows that they occur when a poor boundary estimation has \nbeen made, and has not been caught by the criteria discussed above, in one or both of \nthe FUV cameras. We characterise the latitude difference between the FUV OCB \nproxies by the mode of the distribution (shown by the red vertical lines in Figure 2), \nsince this is insensitive to the presence of these outliers. Black vertical lines represent \nthe mean of the distributions. \n \nFigure 3 shows the variation of the modal FUV OCB proxy latitude differences with \nMLT, for \u03bbWIC-\u03bbSI-12 (blue), \u03bbWIC-\u03bbSI-13 (black) and \u03bbSI-13-\u03bbSI-12 (orange). To put the \nvariation in context we also provide some information on the width of the \ndistributions and the error on the mode. The width of the latitude difference \ndistributions (Figure 2) is estimated by moving out from the mode (red line Figure 2) \nin steps of one 0.2 degree bin in both positive and negative directions to find the \nlatitude range within which 68% of the points lie (which would be equal to the \nstandard deviation for a Gaussian). We estimate the error on the mode by dividing the \nwidth by N , where N is the number of points in each bin of MLT (equivalent to the \nstandard error on the mean for a Gaussian). The estimated widths are approximately \n2\u00b0 and the estimated errors on the mode are < 0.01\u00b0. \n \nThe modal latitude differences between WIC and SI-13 OCB proxies (black curve \nFigure 3) are relatively small, < 0.8\u00b0. Modal latitudinal differences between WIC and \nSI-12 OCB proxies and between SI-13 and SI-12 OCB proxies (blue and orange \ncurves respectively) are also small in the 0700-1700 MLT range. In the predawn \nsector SI-12 boundaries are found to be located poleward of both WIC and SI-13 by \nbetween 1\u00b0-2\u00b0. Conversely SI-12 boundaries are also found to be located at greater \nthan 1 degree equatorward of both WIC and SI-13 in the 1800-2300 MLT range. \n \n3 Comparison with DMSP auroral boundaries \n \nIn this section we compare the latitude of the FUV OCB proxies with the latitude \n(\u03bbDMSP) of OCB proxies obtained from the DMSP satellite. We use the DMSP OCB \nproxies from five DMSP spacecraft (F11-15) for the years 2000-2001, determined \nusing the method of Sotirelis and Newell (2000). On the nightside the OCB is given \nby the b6 boundary which marks the transition from the poleward edge of the sub-\nvisual drizzle region to particle fluxes below detectable levels or the first encounter \nwith polar rain. On the dayside the OCB is given by the doc boundary, located where \nthere is an unambiguous transition between precipitation characteristic of open and \nclosed field lines. The central plasma sheet, boundary plasma sheet and Low Latitude \nBoundary Layer (LLBL) are considered to be closed, and cusp, mantle, open LLBL, \npolar rain and void are considered to be open. If any of these transitions are not clear, \nbecause of ambiguities in the region, then an OCB proxy is not identified (Chisham et \nal., 2005). \n \nThe DMSP OCB proxy is compared to the closest (in both UT and MLT) FUV OCB \nproxy within \u00b1 0.5 hours of MLT and \u00b1 10 minutes of UT, producing over 1600 total \ncomparisons for each FUV detector. However, due to the orbit of the DMSP \nspacecraft, no DMSP boundaries are available in the northern hemisphere between \n2200 and 0500 MLT. \n 6\n \nWe bin the latitude differences into bins of 0.5\u00b0. To reduce the statistical uncertainty \nand produce a smooth distribution with one clear peak the distributions have been \nsmoothed three times using a boxcar average over five points. Figure 4 shows \nexample distributions of latitude differences between DMSP and WIC OCB proxies \nfor four 1-hour MLT bins. The smoothed latitude differences are shown by the crosses \nand vertical lines show the mean (black) and modes (red) of the distributions. The \ndistributions are skewed to the right such that there is a higher probability of finding a \nDMSP OCB proxy at a significantly higher latitude than the equivalent FUV proxy \nthan there is of finding an FUV OCB proxy at a higher latitude. We suggest three \npossible factors which may contribute to these large differences: \n \n1. The method of FUV OCB proxy estimation. When a poor FUV OCB proxy \nestimation is made (and are not caught by the criteria discussed in section 2.1) it is \nnearly always placed equatorward of the poleward edge of the auroral oval emission \nand is therefore more equatorward of the equivalent DMSP boundary than should be \nthe case. \n \n2. The use of finite MLT and UT windows in the comparison procedure. The fine \nscale structure of the OCB may change by small amounts over these window sizes. \nReducing the size of the windows reduces the width of the distributions but also \nreduces the number of comparisons available. \n \n3. Failure of the DMSP OCB estimation procedure. The DMSP OCB estimation is \nmade using an automatic algorithm which will occasionally fail. \n \nThe mean of the distribution, shown by the black vertical lines, is shifted towards this \ntail, and so we therefore use the mode of the distributions, shown by the red vertical \nlines, to characterise the centre of the distribution. \n \nFigure 5 (a-c) shows the variation (with MLT) of the modal latitude differences \nbetween the FUV and DMSP OCB proxies. The horizontal lines at the center of the \nestimated error bars represent the mode of the latitude differences in bins of 1 hr \nMLT. Thin error bars represent the estimated width and the thick error bars represent \nthe estimated error on the mode as explained in section 2.3. Due to the relatively low \nnumber of DMSP-FUV OCB proxy comparisons the estimated widths are fairly large \n(3\u00b0-4\u00b0), exceeding the size of the offsets themselves, although the estimated error on \nthe mode is  smaller (< 1\u00b0). \n \nIn order to produce a continuous function which extrapolates into MLTs where no \nDMSP boundaries are available, following the method set out by Carbary et al. (2003) \na weighted (where weights are n\/max(n) where n is the number of boundary \ncomparisons in each one hour MLT bin) second-order harmonic fit is applied to the \nmodal latitude differences using a least squares fit, \n \n\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5 2sin2cossincos)( 22110 DCDCCL ++++=  (3) \n \nwhere \u03d5  is the angle associated with the MLT ( \u00b0\u00d7\u2261 15MLT ), and C and D are \ncoefficients of the fit. The harmonic coefficients determined by Carbary et al. (2003) \n 7\nare used as initial starting values for the fitting routine and are listed with the final \ncoefficients in Table 1 along with the number of OCB proxies compared for each \ndetector (N). Figure 5 (d) shows the resultant fits and the fit of Carbary et al. (2003) \nfor the case of DMSP and Polar UVI OCB proxies (dashed blue line). \n \nLatitude differences between DMSP and WIC or SI-13 OCB proxies display \nsystematic deviations grossly consistent with the previous DMSP-UVI study (Carbary \net al., 2003), with the largest deviation occurring in the predawn sector. Between 0700 \nand 2300 MLT the fits to latitude differences typically differ by less than a degree. In \ncontrast the average latitude difference between DMSP and SI-12 is larger in the \nevening sector (1600-2400 MLT) and smaller in the morning sector (0-7 MLT), by up \nto 2\u00b0. \n \nOne of the main aims of this study is to produce an estimate of any systematic offsets \nbetween the true OCB and the OCB proxies from the FUV detectors. Assuming the \nDMSP OCB proxy to be the best estimate of the OCB, the comparison between the \nFUV OCB proxies and DMSP OCB proxy would give us a good estimate of this. \nHowever, we note that at individual MLTs there are inconsistencies between the \nDMSP-FUV comparisons and the inter FUV comparisons. Given the considerably \nlarger number of comparisons used in the inter FUV comparisons we would like to \nuse these results to enhance our best estimate of the systematic offsets of the FUV \nOCB proxies from the (unknown) true location of the OCB. We do this by \nconsidering characteristic latitudinal offsets of the WIC, SI-12, SI-13 and DMSP \nproxies, which we designate as W, P, E, and D respectively. \n \nWe relate the characteristic latitudinal offsets W, P, E, and D at each MLT to the \nvalues shown in Figures 3 and 5 as follows; \n \naxaPW SICWI +=+\u2212=\u2212 112\u03bb\u03bb   (4) \nbxbEW SIWIC +=+\u2212=\u2212 213\u03bb\u03bb    (5) \ncxcEP SISI +=+\u2212=\u2212 31312 \u03bb\u03bb     (6) \ndxdWD WICDMSP +=+\u2212=\u2212 4\u03bb\u03bb (7) \nexePD SIDMSP +=+\u2212=\u2212 512\u03bb\u03bb   (8) \nfxfED SIDMSP +=+\u2212=\u2212 613\u03bb\u03bb (9) \n \nwhere a, b, c, d, e, and f are unknown measurement errors and <> indicate an \nensemble property, for which we have used the mode. By comparing the curves in \nFigure 3, we find that the unknown errors, a, b and c, are insignificant and so set them \nequal to zero (however, if a, b, and c are considered to be non-zero, a full treatment \nleads to the same result). To optimally estimate the characteristic latitudinal offsets we \nminimize the sum squared error,  by setting , assuming \nW, P and E are known. We find \n222 fedG ++= 0\/ =dDdG\n \n3\/)( 654 xxxEPWD +++++=  (10) \n \nRearranging equation 10 and substituting for equations 4-6 we find: \n 8\n \n3\/)( 65421 xxxxxDW \u2212\u2212\u2212+=\u2212   (11) \n3\/)( 65431 xxxxxDP \u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212=\u2212  (12) \n3\/)( 65432 xxxxxDE \u2212\u2212\u2212+\u2212=\u2212  (13) \n \nFigure 7 presents these optimised FUV offsets relative to the DMSP proxy (equations \n11-13). The reference DMSP OCB proxy is shown by the orange circle and the \ncharacteristic latitudinal offsets for the WIC (blue), SI-13 (red) and SI-12 (green) \nproxies are shown relative to the DMSP proxy. Latitude difference is shown by the \nradial co-ordinates. \n \n5 Discussion \n \nIn this paper we have compared the latitude of the OCB as estimated from auroral \nimages from the WIC, SI-12 and SI-13 FUV detectors onboard the IMAGE satellite \nand with the latitude of the OCB as estimated by DMSP particle precipitation \nmeasurements. \n \nFigures 3 and 7 show that at most MLTs the average modal difference in the latitude \nbetween the WIC, SI-12 and SI-13 OCB proxies is statistically small (<1\u00b0), although \nat any one MLT bin differences may be larger. Larger average discrepancies are seen \nin the evening and predawn sectors. In the evening (1800-2300 MLT) sector SI-12 \nOCB proxies can be located between 1-2 degrees equatorward of WIC and SI-13 \nOCB proxies and 1-2 degrees poleward of WIC and SI-13 OCB proxies in the \npredawn (0300-0600 MLT) sector. Below we will discuss how the magnetospheric \ncurrent system may explain these differences. \n \nIn the dawn sector ionosphere region-1 Field Aligned Currents (FACs) are directed \ndownward into the ionosphere and visa versa in the evening sector. Equatorward of \nregion-1 currents are region-2 FACs directed oppositely to region-1 FACs (Iijima and \nPotemra, 1978). Upward FACs are associated with down-going electrons and are \ntherefore associated with the WIC and SI-13 electron auroral emission (although these \nalso have a small contribution from secondary electrons produced by the proton \naurora). The dominant charge carrier associated with downward FACs is less clear but \nif they are assumed to be associated with down-going protons (Cran-McGreehin and \nWright, 2005) then we may expect downward FACs to be associated with the SI-12 \nauroral emission. We would therefore expect to see WIC and SI-13 auroral emission \npoleward of SI-12 emission in the evening sector and equatorward in the dawn sector, \nas seen in this study. It is also interesting to note that the offsets between FUV proxies \nis small on the dayside and do not follow the morphology of the FACs. However, it is \nknown that the location at which region-1 and region-2 currents switch from upwards \nto downwards varies over a large MLT range in this sector depending on the \norientation of the IMF By component (Weimer, 2001). Over large time scales the \naverage of the IMF By component is close to zero and therefore the boundary offsets \nseen are also close to zero in this MLT sector. \n \nFigures 5 and 7 show that in the predawn sector the SI-12 OCB proxy is in better \nagreement with DMSP OCB proxy than either the WIC or SI-13 OCB proxies, but is \nstill located over 1\u00b0 equatorward of the DMSP proxies, which are thought to be the \n 9\nbest proxies for the OCB. Previous studies (Wild et al., 2004) have suggested that \nWIC may be an unreliable proxy for the OCB in the predawn sector whilst others \n(Hubert et al., 2006) have used SI-12 or SI-13 in preference to WIC when determining \nthe global OCB, with no real justification. Our study confirms that SI-12 may be a \nbetter estimation for the OCB in the predawn sector. However, Figures 5 and 7 show \nthat at all later magnetic local times the WIC and SI-13 OCB proxies are in better \nagreement with DMSP proxies. The most accurate global determination of the OCB \nmay therefore be obtained by using the individual FUV detector which has the best \ncorrelation with the DMSP OCB proxy in any one MLT sector. For example SI-12 in \nthe 0000-0700 MLT range, SI-13 at 0800-1600 MLT, WIC at 1700-1900 MLT, SI13 \nat 2000-2100 MLT and WIC at 2200-2300 MLT. For single instrument studies WIC \nmay produce the best proxies for the global OCB due to its good global correlation \nwith the DMSP OCB proxy and its better spatial resolution. \n \nFigures 4 and 7 confirm that systematic differences exist between estimations of the \nOCB from DMSP particle precipitation measurements and FUV auroral imagers. \nThese systematic differences may be used to \u2018correct\u2019 auroral boundaries to give a \nmore accurate determination of the OCB. Unfortunately due to the low number of \ncorrelations found between the DMSP and FUV OCB proxies and the lack of data \navailable in the predawn sector (where the offset is at its largest) the uncertainties \ninvolved in this correction are not insignificant. Although we have chosen to use the \nmode of the OCB proxy latitude differences and smoothed to give the most reliable \ndistributions we have seen that using the mean of the latitude differences, or applying \ndifferent degrees of smoothing, can change the fits to the DMSP-FUV OCB proxies \ndifferences in the predawn sector (where the fit is interpolated) by up to a degree. \nTherefore, we can only reliably trust the DMSP correction where DMSP data are \navailable (0600-2100 MLT); however, as a best guess of the location of the OCB, \napplying this correction will statistically give a more accurate result than using the \nuncorrected FUV OCB proxies. \n \n5 Summary \n \nBy comparing over 400000 OCB proxies estimated from the IMAGE WIC, SI-13 and \nSI-12 FUV detectors and from auroral images obtained in December 2000 and \nJanuary 2001-2002, we have shown that systematic differences exist between the \nlatitude of the OCB as estimated by the three detectors. Statistically the OCB proxy \ndifferences are small (< 1\u00b0) except in the predawn sector where the SI-12 OCB proxy \nis found, on average, to be located up to 2\u00b0 poleward of the WIC and SI-13 OCB \nproxies and in the evening sector where the SI-12 OCB proxy can be located up to 2\u00b0 \nequatorward of SI-13 and WIC OCB proxies. \n \nCorrelating FUV OCB proxies with the DMSP OCB proxy confirms that the SI-12 \nOCB proxy is found poleward of the WIC and SI-13 OCB proxies in the predawn \nsector, in better agreement with the DMSP OCB proxy. The WIC and SI-13 OCB \nproxies are found to be in better agreement with the DMSP OCB proxy at all other \nMLTs. A systematic difference between the DMSP and FUV OCB proxies is found \nand may be used to correct the FUV OCB proxies to give a more accurate global \nestimation of the OCB. \n \n 10\nAcknowledgments \n \nPDB was supported by a PPARC\/STFC CASE award, grant no. \nPPA\/S\/C\/2006\/04488.
