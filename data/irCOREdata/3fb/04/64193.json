To \n 2\nunderstand this role and the way biodiversity might be threatened through various \npressures, such as land use change, pollution, climate change and invasive species, we \nmust first assess its richness and how it changes throughout time and varies under \ndifferent conditions. One important way of doing this are Long-Term Ecological \nResearch (LTER) programmes that provide the necessary data series to find temporal \nchanges and therefore allow us to determine their possible causes. The EU Network of \nExcellence ALTER-Net (A Long-Term Biodiversity, Ecosystem and Awareness \nResearch Network; http:\/\/www.alter-net.info\/) has been established to achieve \nsustainable integration of European research capacities in this field, combining \ncurrently 24 partners from 17 countries. A related Network of Excellence, MARBEF \n(http:\/\/www.marbef.org\/), is focussing on marine biodiversity, while ALTER-Net is \naddressing biodiversity research in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. \nThe ALTER-Net workshop organised by Lluis Camarero and held at the Centre for \nAdvanced Studies of Blanes (CEAB-CSIC) on the 15\/16 February 2007 had the topic \nto discuss \u201cApplications of molecular and genetic techniques to assess and monitor \nthe impact of environmental drivers on the biodiversity, structure and function of \nplanktonic communities in lakes\u201d. Scientists from seven European countries and \nrepresenting different aspects of freshwater biodiversity research gave examples of \ntheir work that included the application of various molecular techniques. The talks \ncovered a broad range of organisms (from prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea), \nthrough phyto- and zooplankton, to fish), lake ecosystems (boreal to tropical) and \nscientific fields (ecology, evolutionary biology, physiology) and were followed by a \nday of discussion about the use and usability of molecular methods in the assessment \nof biodiversity of freshwater systems. \n 3\nBiodiversity studies associated with LTER programmes in freshwater or marine \nenvironments usually face two basic limitations. First of all, only a fraction of the \nrecent biodiversity was catalogued by taxonomists and described as species. For \ninstance the majority (>90-99% of taxa) of the recent prokaryotic biodiversity is \ncurrently represented by undescribed species. Secondly, almost all prokaryotes and \nmany of the smaller eukaryotic microorganisms, e.g., many flagellated protists \nsmaller than 10 \u00b5m, lack features enabling their identification by morphological \ncriteria. On the other hand, biodiversity assessments are traditionally performed by \nmorphological identification of organisms, which consequently results in a lack of \ninsights in the biodiversity of smaller protists and almost all prokaryotes. Notably, \nhowever, these two categories undoubtedly represent in all ecosystems on earth the \nnumerically dominating and metabolically most active organisms. Thus, traditional \napproaches for assessment of biodiversity in a particular ecosystem are missing a \nsubstantial part of the biodiversity present. \nMolecular methods offer possibilities to overcome those limitations, either on their \nown or in combination with traditional approaches. Various techniques can be used to \nassess the overall biodiversity of an ecosystem, identify new and unknown organisms, \nreveal and trace spatial and temporal distribution of species and even link biodiversity \nand physiological response of organisms to environmental changes directly. \nTherefore, these methods allow new directions of research that would not have been \npossible with classical methods alone. In addition, molecular methods can be used to \nimprove existing procedures, make them more time- or cost-effective, and develop \n\u201cnext-generation monitoring tools\u201d. They may allow processing numerous samples \nautomatically and identifying species or groups of protists or specific lineages of \nbacteria with fine taxonomical resolution. \n 4\nIt should not be given the impression though that molecular methods are the solution \nto all problems, but they are promising for innovative lines of investigation to be \nincluded in on-going LTER and offer chances for new and exciting research with \nmuch deeper insight into biodiversity of ecosystems. \nIt is clear that in biodiversity research it is necessary to define the taxonomic level or \nphylogenetic resolution (in the case of prokaryotes) at which the analysis should be \ndone. Biodiversity can be defined at the level of functional groups, higher groups, e.g. \nphytoplankton and zooplankton, or prokaryotes and eukaryotes, classes, genera, \nspecies, or even on the intraspecific level of strains. Often this taxonomic level then \ndetermines the molecular tools one can apply.  \nAmong those tools, PCR fingerprinting techniques, like DGGE (Denaturing Gradient \nGel Electrophoresis), are powerful methods for the analysis of whole microbial \ncommunities. They are able to distinguish taxa with only small differences in DNA \nsequences, enable the identification of predominant members of communities, and \nallow the monitoring of compositional changes in community structure in a fast and \nefficient way. DGGE fingerprints usually show 3-35 bands, of which, in the best case, \neach band represents a single abundant taxon. However, rare species are usually \nbelow the detection limit of this method. In contrast, genomic libraries much better \nrepresent the whole community, including rare species, but are more laborious and \nexpensive to establish and analyse. E. Casamayor (Council for Scientific Research, \nSpain) spoke about his research on eukaryotic picoplankton and bacteria, and changes \nin their community structure along environmental gradients, e.g., salinity, oxygen or \ntrophic status gradients using such DGGE fingerprints. PCR primers for the small \nsubunit of ribosomal RNA genes were used to amplify prokaryotic and eukaryotic \nsequences from samples and their DGGE fingerprints gave a picture of the microbial \n 5\ndiversity. The occurrence of bands (taxa) could then be related to environmental \nconditions to understand changes in the communities. In addition, the application of \nDGGE primers for functional genes allowed him to link key metabolic pathways in \nnutrient cycling to occurring microbial populations. \nWhile DGGE is a powerful technique to qualitatively analyse a microbial community, \nit can not be used for quantitative assessment of the occurring taxa. Also, the method \nis labour- and time-intensive and therefore difficult to integrate into routine \nmonitoring programmes. A technique without those drawbacks for monitoring \nprogrammes \u2013 but of course with others \u2013 is flow cytometry, for which J. Gasol \n(Council for Scientific Research, Spain) presented examples of ecosystem research \nfrom the marine environment. Gasol showed results from the analysis of HNA & \nLNA bacteria (high \/ low content of nucleic acids per cell), cyanobacteria and \npicoeukaryotic phytoplankton in different water bodies and under different \nenvironmental conditions using this technique. Flow cytometry is not per se a \nmolecular technique in the sense that it deals with nucleic acids or proteins, but is \nnevertheless closely linked and may be supplemented and greatly improved through \nthe application of molecular probes in the future. Basic flow cytometry methods \ndetect the characteristics of single cells or other particles while passing a laser beam. \nThe device measures the light that passes the particle or is scattered by it. \nFurthermore, fluorescence signals emitted by cells or particles due to the presence of \nautofluorescent substances (e.g. pigments, like chlorophyll) or due to staining with \nfluorescent dyes (e.g., nucleic acid stains) is measured. Two- or three-dimensional \nplots of the measured signals allow to group cells in different clusters that share the \nsame characteristics and a tentative assignment to various higher groups (e.g., \ncyanobacteria, pico- and nano-eukaryotes), which can also be quantified. While flow \n 6\ncytometry is usually a fast and simple method that could be easily included into \naquatic LTER programmes, it is nevertheless limited in its taxonomic resolution. \nTheoretically, this can be overcome by the application of molecular probes (see \nbelow) or various fluorescent dyes, but many of these techniques are still under \ndevelopment and proved difficult in analysing field samples, especially their \nbacterioplanktonic component.  \nT. Buchaca (National Environmental Research Institute (NERI), Denmark) showed \nthe use of the computer program CHEMTAX for the identification and quantification \nof phytoplankton groups in freshwater based on their pigment ratios. It makes use of \nthe fact that certain phytoplankton classes have unique marker pigments or at least \nspecific pigment ratios. While this method has a higher taxonomic resolution than \nflow cytometry, i.e., it allows to identify and quantify phytoplankton at the class-level \nor below, it also requires the analysis of pigments through HPLC (High Performance \nLiquid Chromatography) which is more laborious, and is based on a couple of \nrequirements and assumptions regarding species composition and pigment ratios in \nthe analysed water body. Buchaca therefore clearly stated the need for larger datasets, \ncalibration and comparison with other identification methods before a CHEMTAX \nanalysis can be routinely used in freshwater LTER. \nAs indicated before, the majority of planktonic bacteria and many eukaryotic plankter \nrepresent taxonomically undescribed taxa lacking morphological traits suitable for \ndiscrimination. Therefore, knowledge of temporal and special diversity patterns of \nthose organisms is very scarce, but one solution for getting insights into their \ndynamics is the application of molecular probes. Such probes usually target taxon-\nspecific regions of ribosomal sequences and, under the right hybridization conditions, \nare able to specifically detect the taxon of interest in a mixed sample. They can be \n 7\ndeveloped for a broad range of taxa that covers all levels of biodiversity from higher \ngroups down to strains, and applied to samples in various ways of which Fluorescence \nIn Situ Hybridization (FISH) followed by epifluorescence microscopy is the most \ncommon. M. Hahn (Austrian Academy of Sciences) developed and applied various \nphylogenetic probes, which were specific for genus- and species-like groups of \nfreshwater bacteria, to analyse their seasonal dynamics and spatial distribution. Hahn \nand his co-workers could show that the investigated bacterial populations behaved \nsimilarly to eukaryotic populations of phyto- and zooplankton with pronounced and \nrecurrent seasonal dynamics and consistent vertical and horizontal distribution within \na habitat, a result that would not have been possible to obtain without using molecular \nmethods. Furthermore, Hahn and colleagues demonstrated by using specific \nphylogenetic probes complete niche separation in closely related bacterial taxa \nindistinguishable by morphologic traits. \nMore applications of molecular and activity probes were given by K. Hor\u0148\u00e1k \n(Biology Centre AS CR, Hydrobiological Institute) in the examination of trophic \ninteractions between heterotrophic nanoflagellates, bacteria and viruses in a \nfreshwater reservoir. In addition to DGGE, he and his co-workers used molecular \nprobes to enumerate bacterial groups and determine the bacterial community \ncomposition. A modified FISH assay also allowed them to identify bacterial prey \ndirectly in the food vacuoles of nanoflagellate protists and the combination of FISH \nwith microautoradiography (MAR-FISH) made it possible to determine semi-\nquantitatively the physiological activity of those bacteria under changing \nenvironmental conditions. The combination of these methods created a powerful way \nof understanding the interactions between flagellates, bacteria and viruses at the \nsingle-cell level in a couple of microcosm experiments. A set of manipulation \n 8\nexperiments with microbial plankton communities allowed to identify a genus-like \ncluster of Betaproteobacteria with a stable and relatively high proportion in the \ncommunity, the largest growth potential of all studied bacterial subgroups and the key \nrole in bacterial production processes in the freshwater reservoir. Changes in the \nrelative proportions and activity of the members of this lineage in the community have \nbeen recently suggested as possible indicator of marked changes in the structure and \nfunction of natural bacterioplanton that could reflect sudden (biotic and non-biotic) \nchanges in an environment. D. Diaz de Quintano (University of Barcelona, Spain) \nintroduced the method of CARD-FISH (Catalyzed Reporter Deposition Fluorescence \nIn Situ Hybridization) and the ELF (Enzyme Labelled Fluorescence) technique to the \naudience. While standard FISH protocols are often sufficient for analysing unicellular \norganisms, it can sometimes happen that the strength of the fluorescence signal is not \nhigh enough for a secure detection, i.e., when there are not enough ribosomal targets \nfor the probe to bind to. This is often the case with small cells, like bacteria or \npicoeukaryotes, dormant cells or cells in a low-activity physiological state. CARD-\nFISH uses a horseradish-peroxidase that is bound to the molecular probe to catalyse \nfluorochrome-labelled tyramide, which amplifies the fluorescent signal 10 to 100 \ntimes in comparison to a standard probe. The technique is more elaborate though than \nnormal FISH and requires additional steps and sometimes target-specific \noptimization. While CARD-FISH is another tool to identify organisms, ELF is a \nmethod that gives the opportunity to analyse physiological processes of those \norganisms, a crucial next step in biodiversity research.  J. Vrba (Czech Academy of \nSciences) showed in his talk such physiological analyses using the ELF technique for \ndetecting the activity of extracellular phosphatases at a single-cell level. The \nproduction of this enzyme is usually accompanied by high-affinity uptake of Pi and is \n 9\na species-specific or cell-specific feature; i.e., it is not a general response to starvation \nin either phytoplankton or bacterioplankton. With phosphorus deficiency being \nfrequently the limiting factor in plankton growth and the major source of selective \npressure on single microbial populations in a variety of aquatic environments, the ELF \ntechnique gives detailed information about the physiological status of natural \nplanktonic microbes. \nAfter biodiversity research at the levels of higher groups down to the species level, \nintra-specific biodiversity was the topic of R. Groben\u2019s (Centre for Ecology & \nHydrology, U.K.) talk in which he gave an overview about the development and \napplication of microsatellite and AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) \nmarkers in planktonic species. While \u201cclassical\u201d monitoring programmes can maybe \nanalyse biodiversity down to the species level, investigating the hidden intra-specific \ndiversity requires molecular tools. Identification and characterization at strain-level \nmight be important though when it comes to the analysis of toxic versus non-toxic \nstrains of the same species or when strains have varying susceptibilities towards \nenvironmental conditions (e.g., viruses, temperature changes or nutrient depletion) \nthat might determine their ecological success. After an introduction into the two \nmarker types and their advantages and disadvantages, Groben gave an overview of \nresearch that has been done on molecular markers in marine and freshwater plankton. \nThis showed that the application of these useful techniques to protists is still in its \ninfancy in aquatic sciences and most work is published in terms of methods \ndevelopment. Nevertheless, more and more papers are currently coming out that deal \ndirectly with real ecological questions. J. Mergeay (KU Leuven, Belgium) illustrated \nthe possibilities of molecular markers further in his talk about the water flea Daphnia \nas a model organism for biodiversity research. Daphnia species are key components \n 10\nin the food webs of most standing waters, have a remarkable ability to cope with \nenvironmental changes and, after two centuries of intensive research, is one of the \necologically best known freshwater organisms. Still, molecular methods can add to \nthis pool of knowledge and allow further studies of population genetics, phylogeny \nand ecology of this genus. For example, molecular markers have allowed the \ndetection of many cryptic species, which has led to a paradigm shift in recent years, \nfrom low global species diversity and cosmopolitanism to high species diversity and \nlocal endemism or provincialism. In addition, Mergeay showed that neutral molecular \nmarkers can provide information on the origin of biogeographic patterns \n(\u201cphylogeography\u201d), but also on rates of dispersal, colonization and gene flow. \nSimultaneously, genetic analyses of ecologically relevant and heritable traits (ERT) \nallow the detection of direct selective pressures, like anthropogenic stress. Moreover, \nthe combination of neutral markers and ERT allows one to estimate the relative \nimportance of neutral effects like drift compared to natural selection. Finally, the \napplication of genetic markers (neutral and\/or ERT) to historical archives like lake \nsediments allows a detailed reconstruction of the response of lake biota to different \necological and evolutionary processes (\u201cpaleogenetics\u201d).  \nFurther examples of freshwater long-term monitoring sites and the research associated \nwith them were given by U. M\u00fcnster (Tampere University of Technology, Finland) \nand M. Ventura (National Environmental Research Institute, Denmark). M\u00fcnster \nused a variety of conventional (bacterial counts & cultivation, metabolic analyses) and \nmolecular methods (DGGE, FISH, sequencing of genomic libraries) to analyse the \ncomposition of planktonic and sediment-dwelling prokaryotic communities in Finnish \nboreal lakes. He and his co-workers link microbial community structure with \nbiocatalytic and metabolic function in order to better understand its value and role in \n 11\necosystem function, stability and resilience. Their research especially focused on the \necological role of Archaea, which are not restricted to extreme environments, as was \nthought in earlier days, but can be found in a wide range of environments. The data \npresented by M\u00fcnster demonstrated a large archael diversity in Finnish lakes, \nincluding the discovery of novel groups.  \nWhile M\u00fcnster concentrated on boreal lakes, Ventura gave examples of research from \nthe various sites NERI investigates, which range from Greenland to Greece, and also \nincludes lakes outside of Europe. The comparison of biodiversity in the lakes of this \nhuge transect provides a way of elucidating long-term responses to climate changes \nby analogy observations, i.e., studies of how structure, biodiversity and dynamics \nchange along existing climate gradients (e.g. along gradients of longitude, latitude and \naltitude) and use this knowledge to estimate the nature of ecosystems and biodiversity \nat a given time under predicted future climate conditions. It also allows interesting \ninsights into ecosystem structures, trophic interactions and species richness in \ncontrasting lakes. For example, cold northern lakes showed strong top-down effects \non zooplankton that diminished with increases in nutrient state or at higher \ntemperatures. In a second comparison, using a subset of different European lakes, \nbottom-up forces, such as nutrient concentration, were the most important predictors \nof zooplankton biomass.  \n \nOne of the aims of ALTER-Net, the building of networks and exchange of \ninformation among scientists working on biodiversity of long-term monitoring sites, \nwas clearly achieved during this workshop. The talks and discussions were interesting \nand fruitful and showed the broad range of topics and research projects within this \nfield. Despite the fact that the speakers presented many exciting research results that \n 12\nwere associated with various biodiversity research projects, the focus of the workshop \nwas definitely methodological and gave many examples of the molecular tools that \ncan be used in analysing the biodiversity of prokaryotes, protists or higher organisms \nand their links to ecosystem function. Under this aspect, also general questions were \ndiscussed, for example, at which level biodiversity is \u201cmeaningful\u201d in structuring an \necosystem and regulating its function. Is it necessary to know the diversity at the \nspecies or intra-specific level, or is it enough to identify and analyse functional groups \nto understand how an ecosystem works? Also, is this crucial \u201cecosystem-shaping\u201d \nlevel different for the different groups of organisms (bacteria, phytoplankton and \nzooplankton)? There are clearly many questions still open in this area and molecular \nmethods can provide valuable tools in answering them and helping us to understand \nthe real importance of biodiversity. \n \n \nAcknowledgements:  \n \nThis workshop was funded by the EU Network of Excellence \u201cALTER-Net\u201d (GOCE-\nCT-2003-505298). \n"}
