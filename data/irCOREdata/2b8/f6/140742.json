Introduction \nHypercholesterolemia represents a serious health problem in wealthy economies and its \nincidence is rising in developing countries and poor communities owing to shifts in the \nalimentary habits [1]. Such a global concern on hypercholesterolemia makes cheap and \npatient-friendly therapeutic approaches particularly attractive. Diet control and \nprescription of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are \ncommon efficient strategies, but the first one does require willpower and the second one \nis not exempt of collateral effects [2,3]. The use of traps that can capture bile acids \ninvolved in the emulsification of fatty acids at the intestine is a particularly useful \nalternative or coadjutant in a broad range of therapies for patients [4,5]. Bile acids \nconsist of a curved steroidal skeleton with a hydrophilic \u03b1 face, which includes a \ncarboxylic acid group, and a hydrophobic \u03b2 face, which provides amphiphilic character \nand self-associative behavior [6]. The commercially available anionic resins (colestipol \nand cholestyramine, among others) exchange their chloride anions with anionic bile \nacids in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in insoluble complexes that are eliminated in \nthe feces [7]. This leads to lower adsorption of fats and to the conversion of plasma \ncholesterol to bile acid in order to normalize bile acid levels, which results in a decrease \nof cholesterol levels [3]. \nThe search on novel polymeric materials capable of acting as selective and efficient \ntraps is mostly based on the optimization of hydrophobic and ionic interactions [8-11]. \nThe results obtained with natural and synthetic polymers indicate that a bile acid \nsequestrant should meet the following features [12-15]: i) to posses cationic groups that \nenable a fast interaction with bile salts; ii) to contain hydrophobic groups to enhance the \nstability of the complexes; and iii) to swell to a certain extent to make the network \naccessible to the bile salt. Molecular imprinting technology has been tested as tool to \noptimize performances of selective traps [16-18]. This technology consists in adding the \ntarget molecule to a monomers solution for enabling the arrangement of the monomers \naround the target analyte according to their interaction capability. Such an arrangement \nis fixed during polymerization. After extraction of the template molecules, the resultant \npolymeric networks exhibit pockets with size and shape specific for the template and \nwith the most favorable chemical groups for the reuptake once in contact again with the \n 4 \ntemplate molecules [19-21]. Both non-covalent and covalent imprinting have been \napplied for creating bile acids traps using vinyl or acrylic monomers [16-18]. Although \nthe imprinting effect in aqueous environment is harder to achieve than in organic media, \nimprinted networks have shown a greater uptake of sodium cholate, both in vitro and in \nvivo, than the non imprinted networks [16-18].  \nTypically, the selection of the nature and the relative proportion of the monomers used \nfor creating polymeric traps is based on literature data, previous experience of \nresearchers, and the results of trial and error assays. Such a procedure involves hard and \ntime consuming experimental work and remarkable costs for materials. Recent \napproaches to the rational design of functional polymeric networks have shown that in \nsilico screening of suitable monomers for each specific target molecules can \nsignificantly shorten the process and improve the success rate [22]. Despite molecular \nimprinting technology has been routinely used for more than 20 years, implementation \nwith computational modeling is still relatively novel [23]. The aim of this work was to \napply computational modeling for the screening of monomers with affinity for cholic \nacid and use some of the selected monomers for synthesizing cholate-imprinted and \nnon-imprinted networks. Adsorption isotherms were analyzed to test the predictive \nvalue of the computational modeling results. For the networks with better performance, \nthe cross-linking density was tuned in order to elucidate the incidence of the mesh size \nin the capture of sodium cholate from an aqueous environment. The experiments were \ncarried out both at equilibrium state to obtain relevant parameters of the adsorption \nprocess and in dynamic mode (i.e., under a certain flow of cholate solution) to simulate \nphysiological conditions. The results were compared with those obtained using \ncommercially available colestipol and conclusions about the incidence of computational \ndesign and molecular imprinting on the structure of the binding sites were extracted.   \n \n2. Experimental  \n2.1. Materials \nCholic acid, sodium cholate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA), 1,1\u2032-\nazobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), ethyleneglycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMP), and \n2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DEAEM) were from Sigma-Aldrich (Spain). N-(3-\naminopropyl)-methacrylamide hydrochloride (APMA\u00b7HCl) was from Polysciences \n 5 \n(Germany). 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was from Merck (Germany). \nDimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was puriss. grade (  99.5%) from Fluka (Spain) and used \nas received in bottles containing molecular sieves (H2O  0.01%). All other chemicals \nwere analytical or HPLC grade and used without further purification. \n \n2.2. Molecular modeling  \nThe computational design used for preparing the networks has been described elsewhere \n[23-26]. Briefly, the workstation used to simulate monomer\u2013template interactions was a \nSilicon Graphics Octane running IRIX 6.5 operating system, configured with two \n195MHz reduced instruction set processors, 1GB memory and a 20GB fixed drive. The \nsystem was used to execute the software package SYBYL 7.0TM (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, \nMissouri USA). The structure of cholic acid was drawn and its energy minimized using \nthe dielectric constant value of DMSO to get stable conformations. A virtual library \ncontaining 18 of the most commonly used monomers in molecular imprinting was used \nand the energy of these monomers minimized as the template \u2018in DMSO\u2019. The \nLEAPFROGTM algorithm (30000 iterations) was applied to screen the library of \nfunctional monomers for their possible interactions with the template.  \n \n2.3 Synthesis of the networks \nEach functional monomer EGMP, DEAEM or APMA\u00b7HCl (9% mol) was mixed with \nthe cross-linker EGDMA (91% mol). The monomers solutions (3 ml) were diluted with \nthe same volume of DMSO (Table 1) and 30 mg (1.2% mol) AIBN were added. In the \ncase of the imprinted networks, 150 mg cholic acid (2.5% mol) were incorporated too. \nThe reaction mixtures were purged with nitrogen and then left to polymerize at 70 \u00b0C \nfor 24 h. The bulk polymers were ground in methanol using a manual mortar and then \nwet-sieved through 125 and 38 \u03bcm meshes (Endecotts, UK). The particles retained on \nthe 38 \u03bcm mesh underwent Soxhlet extraction with methanol (500 ml, 24 h) and then \nwere dried under vacuum. Networks containing APMA\u00b7HCl were also prepared with \nlower degrees of cross-linking, replacing a certain volume of EGDMA by HEMA, as \nindicated in Table 2.   \n \n2.4. SEM images \n 6 \nParticles of each polymer network were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy \n(LEO-435VP SEM, Leo Electron Microscopy, UK). Samples were mounted on double-\nsided tape on aluminum stubs and sputter-coated with gold\/palladium, and micrographs \nwere taken at various magnifications. \n \n2.5. Degree of swelling \n50 mg dried particles were immersed in 1 ml water and mechanically shaken for two \nhours. Then, the wet particles were gently filtered, weighed and placed in an oven at \n50\u00baC for two days. The degree of swelling was calculated using the equation: \n100\u00b7\n)(\nWd\nWdWw\nQ        (1) \nwhere Ww and Wd are the weights of the particles after swelling and once dried, \nrespectively. The experiments were carried out in duplicate. \n \n2.6. Adsorption isotherms \nEquilibrium batch binding experiments were performed, in triplicate, with 1.5 mg of \npolymers that were loaded in ultracentrifuge columns (Pierce Centrifuge Columns 0.8 \nml, ThermoScientific, Rockford IL USA) and mixed with 500 \u00b5L of sodium cholate \nsolution (0.1-0.5 mM in water, pH values ranging from 6.40 to 6.73). The columns were \nplaced into Eppendorf tubes and mechanically shaken at room temperature for 12 h and \nthen centrifuged for 2 min at 600 rpm. The concentration of sodium cholate remaining \nin the medium was spectrophotometrically quantified as previously reported [27]. \nBriefly, 3 ml of sulfuric acid 96% w\/w were poured into test tubes containing 1 ml of \nsodium cholate solution inside a water\/ice bath. After mixing, the test tubes were heated \nto 70\u00baC for 30 min and then the absorbance was measured at 389 nm (Agilent 8354, \nGermany).  \nThe adsorption isotherms were characterized using the Freundlich model: \naFmLogB log\u00b7log       (2) \nwhere B (\u00b5mol per gram of polymer) and F (mol\/l) are the concentrations of bound and \nfree sodium cholate, respectively, and a and m are fitting constants that yield a measure \nof physical binding parameters [28]. The preexponential factor a is a measure of the \ncapacity (number of binding sites) and average affinity of the network. The constant m \nis a heterogeneity index; m values close to 1 indicate that all binding sites are identical \n 7 \nfrom an energetic point of view, while m values near 0 indicate heterogeneous binding \npoints [29].  \nThe affinity distribution of the binding sites (i.e., the plot of the number of sites, N, that \nhave association constant, K) was estimated using the following equation [28]: \nKmemmaKN \u00b7log\u00b7303.22 )1\u00b7(\u00b7\u00b7303.2)(     (3) \nwithin the limits Kmin= 1\/Fmax  and  Kmax= 1\/Fmin . \n \n2.7. Binding of sodium cholate from aqueous medium \n20 mg of each polymer were packed in 1 ml filtration tubes (Supelco, Bellefonte PA \nUSA), which were placed in a VisiPrep 12-vial vacuum manifold (Supelco, Bellefonte \nPA USA) connected to a vacuum pump. The cartridges containing the polymers were \nwashed with 2 ml of water, 2 ml of 0.1% NaOH in 50:50 ethanol:water solution, 2 ml of \n0.1 M formic acid, and 2 ml of methanol. Then, 1 ml aliquots of 0.2 mM sodium cholate \nsolutions in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 were successively passed through the polymers up \nto a total volume of 30 or 50 ml. The flow rate of the solution through the cartridge, \nwith the vacuum pump connected since the beginning of the experiment, was 1 ml\/min. \nEach extracted portion was collected and the concentration of unbound sodium cholate \nwas spectrophotometrically determined as explained in section 2.6. The experiments \nwere carried out in triplicate. \n \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1. Design of the polymer networks \nIn silico screening of the most suitable monomers for preparing a certain functional \npolymer is gaining attention owing to the considerable number of monomers that can be \ntested in short time and without consumption of materials [25,26]. Our strategy \ncomprised the development of a library of monomers, the selection of monomers with \naffinity for the target molecule, the synthesis of polymers using these monomers, and \ntheir testing in re-binding experiments. A virtual library of 18 commonly used \nfunctional monomers that are capable of interacting with cholic acid through \nelectrostatic, hydrophobic, van der Waals forces or dipole-dipole interactions was \nscreened against the template. The interaction energies obtained by docking template \nand monomer structures, minimized using the dielectric constant value of DMSO, are \n 8 \nreported in Table 3. DMSO was selected for the modeling as it was the porogen chosen \nfor the preparation of MIPs by radical polymerization. In fact it has been previously \nshown that MIPs prepared in polar organic solvents (DMF and DMSO) also possess \ngood affinity for the template in aqueous solutions [30-32]. Strong interactions such as \nelectrostatic, present between monomers and template at the polymerization stage in a \npolar solvent, have high chances to take place also in aqueous solution during the \nrebinding. Normally, when MIPs need to work in aqueous solutions, the modeling is \nalso repeated minimizing molecular structures using the dielectric constant of water. \nNevertheless, since the molecules of solvents are not physically included during the \nscreening process, the energy values for monomers-template complexes, when \nstructures are minimized either in water or in polar organic solvents, are usually very \nsimilar. \nThe results in Table 3 show that allylamine, in its charged (protonated) form, \ndemonstrated the strongest energy of interaction with sodium cholate. However this \nmonomer was not considered for the MIP preparation, since, as shown previously [33], \nallylamine is prevalently neutral in a wide range of pH values and practically never \nprotonated. APMA\u00b7HCl and EGMP were also among the monomers with the highest \naffinity for cholic acid (Table 3). Aminoethyl methacrylate both in HCl salt and free \nbase showed strong interactions with the template and was initially considered for the \npreparation of MIPs. However it was subsequently discarded because of its limited \nsolubility in DMSO and other polar solvents. DEAEM, which is the most basic \nmonomer among those tested [33], showed a binding energy lower than APMA and \nEGMP but slightly greater than the cross-linker agent EGDMA. Most of the monomers \nthat appear in Table 3 between EGMP and DEAEM are either very weak bases, which \nare known to be neutral, or possess anionic acid groups, which interacted with cholic \nacid through the same positions as EGMP and were not therefore considered for further \nexperiments. According to the modeling, EGMP and DEAEM can interact with cholic \nacid through hydrogen bonds, while APMA\u00b7HCl can also electrostatically interact with \nthe carboxylic groups (Figure 1). Since hydrogen bonds cannot be established in \naqueous solutions, among the three monomers APMA HCl was from the beginning the \nmost promising for production of polymeric networks with high affinity for cholic acid. \n 9 \nNevertheless also EGMP and DEAEM were selected as functional monomers and used \nfor the production of MIPs specific for the target molecule. \n \nBoth imprinted (MIP) and non-imprinted (NIP) networks were prepared in order to test \nalso the effect of the molecular imprinting on the affinity of the networks for sodium \ncholate. Cholic acid was used as template molecule since the sodium salt is not soluble \nin the monomers solution. The functional monomer:template molar ratio was set at 4:1, \nwhich is a common molar ratio in non-covalent imprinting for ensuring the saturation of \nthe binding points of template [34,35]. Non-imprinted networks were prepared in the \nabsence of template. After polymerization, the polymers were mechanically crashed and \nwet-sieved in methanol, and the portion of particles retained between 38 and 125 \u03bcm \nmeshes was used for the following experiments. The particles were subjected to Soxhlet \nextraction with methanol to ensure the complete removal of both fines and unreacted \nmonomers and template molecules. SEM micrographs of APMA\u00b7HCl-based networks \nare shown in Figure 2. The high DMSO proportion used during synthesis led to porous \nnetworks. Similar morphologies were observed for the other polymer networks. \n \n3.2. Sodium cholate binding isotherms  \nBinding isotherms clearly showed the incidence of the functional monomer on the \naffinity of the polymers for sodium cholate (Figure 3). Despite the high binding energies \nidentified for EGMP by the computer modeling, the networks prepared with this \nmonomer showed a binding isotherm similar to that of networks prepared without \nfunctional monomer. This finding was not, however, surprising since it can be easily \nexplained by the inability of the monomer to form hydrogen bonds in aqueous medium \nand also by the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic groups of the functional \nmonomer and cholate molecules. Such electrostatic repulsion was not highlighted by the \nmodeling because cholic acid was screened against the monomers in its neutral form. \nOppositely, DEAEM and APMA\u00b7HCl significantly enhanced the binding capability of \nthe polymer networks. The isotherm obtained for APMA\u00b7HCl-based networks showed a \nhigh binding affinity with remarkably low concentrations at equilibrium, which means \nthat most sodium cholate was absorbed by the network. This isotherm, which resembles \nthat described for colestipol, suggests that the APMA\u00b7HCl-based networks could \n 10 \nefficiently retain bile salts in the gastrointestinal tract [7]. As predicted by the modeling, \nthe protonated amine group of APMA enables ionic interactions with the carboxylic \nacid group of cholate, while hydrophobic interactions between the apolar face of cholate \nand the cross-linking points can help to stabilize the adsorption.  \n \nThe binding isotherms were fitted to the Freundlich model (Statgraphics Plus 5.1, \nStatistical Graphics Corp.) in order to gain insight into the heterogeneity of the binding \nsites (which is a common phenomenon in imprinted networks) from an energy point of \nview [36]. Freundlich isotherm measures the heterogeneity of binding site as affinity \ndistributions (AD) and heterogeneity index (m) [29]. The values in Table 4 show that \ncontrol networks have m values above 1, which indicates that the networks are \nhomogeneous; i.e., there are not specific binding points (Table 4). The other polymers \nhave m values between 0 and 1, confirming the existence of binding sites of varying \naffinity and selectivity, probably due to differences in chemical groups distribution and \nin depth and shape of the binding pockets. APMA\u00b7HCl-based networks show the lowest \nm values. This means that in these polymers there are both high and low affinity \ndomains; the first ones may correspond to the sites in which APMA\u00b7HCl is located. No \nincidence of the cross-linking degree on the binding isotherms was observed in the \nrange evaluated (data not shown). EGMP and DEAEM MIPs showed m values lower \nthan the corresponding non-imprinted networks. This suggests that the presence of \ntemplate during the polymerization contributes to the heterogeneity of the material, \nincreasing the affinity of the binding sites by causing an adequate spatial arrangement of \nthe monomers. The networks with APMA\u00b7HCl showed such a high affinity for the \ntemplate that the imprinting did not seem to improve the binding sites. Such a high \naffinity is also responsible for the relatively worse fitting to the Freundlich model \ncompared to the other networks.  \n \nAffinity distributions of the binding sites of each polymer are shown in Figure 4. The \nexponential decay (linear log-log plot) is characteristic of the isotherm region far from \nsaturation [29]. The subsaturation region, in which the high affinity binding sites are \npreferentially filled, is the most interesting for a wide range of applications of non-\ncovalently imprinted networks. This is because the difference between imprinted and \n 11 \nnon-imprinted networks is particularly evident at low loadings. In addition it is very \ndifficult to reach saturation in most non-covalently imprinted polymers because of the \nheterogeneity of the material. As expected from the m values, the affinity distributions \nshown in Figure 4 indicate that the networks have association constants ranging from \n3100 to 160,000 l\/mol, with predominance, in all polymers, of sites with low affinity. \nWhen compared with the networks prepared with the other functional monomers, \nEGMP polymers showed the least amount of binding points with also the lowest \naffinity. The imprinting notably enhanced both the number of binding sites and their \naffinity. On the other hand, the APMA\u00b7HCl networks possessed many more binding \nsites of high association constant, but the contribution of the imprinting was not evident. \nThese results confirm that APMA\u00b7HCl itself was able to create high affinity binding \nsites and that the arrangement during synthesis did not lead to a relevant improvement \nin the association constant. Networks prepared with DEAEM showed an intermediate \nbehavior and the imprinting contributed to increase the number of high affinity binding \nsites. On the bases of these results EGMP polymers were abandoned and further testing \nwas continued using only APMA HCl and DEAEM networks.  \n \n3.3. Removal of sodium cholate from aqueous medium \nThe capability of the polymers to act as traps of sodium cholate in phosphate buffer pH \n7.4 was tested in a dynamic mode, i.e., under a relatively rapid flow of cholate solution \nthrough the polymer bed. This was done in the attempt to simulate the conditions in the \ngut. Under these experimental conditions, only the networks with a high affinity and \ncapable of rapidly capturing the target molecules would be able to effectively retain \nsodium cholate. The amounts of sodium cholate retained and non-retained by the \nnetworks made with and without (controls) functional monomers are depicted in Figures \n5-7. Both DEAEM and APMA\u00b7HCl polymers showed higher binding capacity than the \ncontrol polymers. Between the two monomers, APMA\u00b7HCl provided the networks with \nthe highest binding capacity, significantly diminishing the concentration of sodium \ncholate in the aqueous medium.   \n \n3.4. Effect of the degree of cross-linking  \n 12 \nIn the attempt to optimize the performance of the APMA\u00b7HCl networks, we evaluated \nthe feasibility of decreasing the degree of cross-linking of the polymer network, by \nreplacing part of EGDMA with a structurally related monofunctional monomer such as \nHEMA. Cholate molecule is relatively large, about 17 \u00c5 length and 5.3 \u00c5 width \nestimated using CS Chem3D Std  (CambridgeSoft Corp., MA). The mesh size of the \nnetwork prepared with 91% mol EGDMA (8.7 \u00c5 distance between two adjacent cross-\nlinking points) [37] is too low to enable sodium cholate to reach all the binding points \neven after swelling in water. Therefore, a set of polymers were prepared with decreasing \ncontent of EGDMA and fix proportion of functional monomer APMA\u00b7HCl (Table 2). \nThe capability of the resulting MIPs and NIPs to trap sodium cholate in the dynamic \nmode was evaluated. As can be seen in Figure 8, the loading significantly improved (2-\nfold) when the EGDMA was reduced up to 31.7 mol% (F networks in Table 2); below \nthis proportion the amount loaded leveled off or even decreased. The initial \nimprovement can be clearly attributed to the easiness of the cholate molecules to diffuse \nthrough the polymer network as the mesh size increases. The APMA\u00b7HCl particles, in \nthe range of cross-linking evaluated, had similar degrees of swelling in water (250-\n300%), but are significantly different in mesh size. Upon synthesis, the distance \nbetween adjacent cross-linking points was estimated from the number of molecules of \ncross-linker EGDMA per unit of volume (cm3) of network [37]: \n3\n10\nA\nX\nNEGDMA\n \nR       (4) \nwith NA being the Avogadro\u00b4s number. For example, the distance between adjacent \ncross-linking points is expected to be 12 and 14.3 \u00c5 for F and G networks, respectively. \nThese values are 37 and 64% larger than the distance of the APMA\u00b7HCl networks \nprepared with the highest degree of cross-linking. \n \nThe non-imprinted polymers prepared with APMA\u00b7HCl behaved as well as the \nimprinted ones due to the ability of the functional monomer itself to bind strongly \nsodium cholate creating high affinity binding sites (F MIP and NIP profiles were \nsuperimposable, Figure 8). This is quite advantageous from the point of view of \npotential pharmaceutical applications of the materials as traps of bile acids in vivo. In \nfact MIPs usually require prolonged washing steps to achieve total removal of template \n 13 \nand in most cases the risk of template leaching, once in contact with physiological \nfluids, is not completely eliminated. This would be a major issue and could compromise \nMIPs approval for clinical use. It would be much easier to get approval for a sorbent \nlike APMA\u00b7HCl NIP, which has got affinity and binding capacity for sodium cholate \nhigh enough to be used in clinical applications and at the same time would not be \naffected by issues as template leaching.  \nThe results of this work revealed that computational modeling is adequate for a fast \nidentification of the most suitable monomers to create efficient traps for a certain \nsubstance. Once the functional monomer is chosen, a conventional polymer synthesis \nenables the synthesis of high affinity networks avoiding waste of time and resources. \nThis rational approach can therefore be of general application for creating traps for a \nwide range of substances with foreseeable high performances.     \n \n4. Conclusions \nComputational modeling is a useful tool for the screening monomers with affinity for a \ngiven target molecule, enabling a rational design of functional networks. Nevertheless, \nsince the modeling is performed using some approximations such as a \u2018virtual\u2019 inclusion \nof solvent through the use of its dielectric constant during minimization, differences can \noccur between modeling and experimental results especially when polymerization and \nrebinding steps are done in different liquids. In this specific case the use of functional \nmonomers containing amine groups notably enhanced the capability of the acrylic \nnetworks to uptake sodium cholate. Combination of the screened functional monomers \nwith molecular imprinting technology remarkably improved the performance of \nnetworks made of monomers with affinity for the target, through an adequate \narrangement of the monomers into pockets suitable to host the target molecules. \nHowever, molecular imprinting technology is of less relevance when the functional \nmonomer itself, as predicted by the computer modeling, has a strong affinity for the \ntemplate\/analyte. In addition, in this work we showed that by tuning the degree of cross-\nlinking of networks with high affinity functional monomers it is possible to enable \noptimization of the loading capability, making the materials useful as traps of \nundesirable biological molecules.  \n \n 14 \nAcknowledgment  \nWork financed by MICINN (SAF2008-01679), FEDER and Xunta de Galicia \n(PGIDT07CSA002203PR).
