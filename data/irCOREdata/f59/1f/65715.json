INTRODUCTION \nAdaptive methods are well-established for analysis of elastostatic problems using finite \nelements and are now emerging for meshless methods. Many publications in this area \nmeasure the capability of adaptive procedures by comparison with the limited number of \nexact solutions which exist. One of these problems is that of a cantilever subjected to end \nloading [1]. The purpose of this paper is to highlight potential sources of error in the use of \nthis solution relating to the particular boundary conditions assumed and to show that it is a \nsolution neither appropriate for testing adaptivity nor as a model of a real cantilever. \nWhile some may consider that the observations we make are self-evident and well-known, \nthe literature contains many counter examples. This paper provides graphic illustration of the \n2 \n \n \neffect of various boundary conditions on the cantilever beam solution. To our knowledge \nthese effects have not been presented in detail in the existing literature. We also demonstrate \nthe difference between the behaviour of a real cantilever and the idealised Timoshenko \ncantilever. It is our hope that this paper will help to reduce the misuse of the Timoshenko \ncantilever beam in the evaluation of adaptive analysis schemes, and perhaps encourage the \nuse of a more realistic cantilever beam model as a benchmark problem instead.     \n2. PROBLEM DEFINITION \nFigure 1 shows a cantilever beam of depth D, length L and unit thickness, which is  fully-\nfixed to a support at x = 0 and carries an end load P.

However, inspection of equations (1) to (5) shows the stresses to be \nsmooth functions of position, with no stress concentrations or singularities. Therefore it \nwould not appear to be a suitable test for an adaptive procedure where a uniform mesh or \ngrid is refined to improve accuracy locally to areas of high gradients in field quantities. Any \nanalysis that yields a non-smooth field for this problem (and there are many examples in the \nliterature on adaptivity) is an analysis of a cantilever under different boundary conditions, for \nwhich the exact solution is incorrect.  \nThe performance of an adaptive procedure is widely measured using the effectivity index \n\u03b8  which is defined for a refined mesh (or grid) as  \n\u03b7\n\u03b7\u03b8\n*\n= ........................................................................................................................(6) \nwhere \u03b7  is the error estimate based on the difference between the solution from the fine \nmesh the coarse mesh, and  is the error estimate based on the difference between the exact \nsolution and the coarse mesh [2]. The effectivity index \u03b8 for the cantilever problem is \nmeaningless unless the boundary conditions are modelled as specified in [1].  \n*\u03b7\n4 \n \n \n3. ANALYSIS OF THE TIMOSHENKO AND GOODIER CANTILEVER \nIt is not possible to model the cantilever in [1] using finite elements by applying the stated \ntraction boundary conditions only. In that case the problem is unstable as there is an \nunrestrained rotational rigid-body mode. Instead stability and an accurate model can be \nachieved by imposing the load as a parabolically varying shear force at each end according \nto equation (3) and by applying essential boundary conditions at the \u201cfixed end\u201d according to \nequations (4) and (5). \nTo demonstrate the effects of using different boundary conditions five adaptive analyses of \ncantilevers have been carried out. The boundary conditions for each analysis are shown in \nFigure 2 and have been chosen to match the conditions used in various previous \npublications. In analysis A full-fixity is applied to the nodes at the support, while the load P \nis applied uniformly distributed over the vertical surface at x = L, e.g. references [2, 13]. In \nanalysis B the load is instead distributed parabolically, e.g. [6]. In analysis C, fixity at the \nsupport is released via rollers above and below the fixed mid-point, e.g. [14, 15, 16]. In \nanalysis D traction boundary conditions are applied at x = 0 to the cantilever of analysis C. \nFinally, analysis E includes parabolic variation of applied shear traction at x = L with \nessential boundary conditions at x = 0 to match the solution in equations (4) and (5). \nAnalysis E is the only one that exactly models the boundary conditions (traction and \nessential) of the cantilever in [1] for which equations (1) to (5) are correct.  \n4. NUMERICAL RESULTS \nThe behaviours of the cantilevers shown in Figure 2 have been studied using conventional \nadaptive finite element modelling. In each case the cantilevers are of dimensions D = 2, L = \n8 and the applied end load is equivalent to a uniform stress of 1 unit per unit area (i.e. P = \n5 \n \n \n2). The material properties used are E = 1000 and \u03bd = 0.25. Meshes of 8-noded quadrilaterals \nwere adaptively refined using the Zienkiewicz-Zhu approach [2] until the energy norm of the \nerror was < 1% of the energy norm of the solution.  \nFigure 3 shows the final refined mesh for each analysis. Also shown are the contours of \nshear stress throughout the cantilevers. Of greatest importance here is the result for analysis \nE. The refined mesh is uniform because the stress field varies smoothly and corresponds to \nthe solution in [1]. The other results are non-uniform due to differences in the boundary \nconditions imposed. It is clear that unstructured refinement is produced due to differences in \nthe boundary conditions.  \nIn analysis A, where the load is applied as a uniform shear traction to the right hand end, the \nstress conditions at the top and bottom right hand corners change rapidly and cause local \nrefinement in these regions. This is caused by the incompatibility between the boundary \nconditions for shear at the corners. The top and bottom faces enforce a zero stress boundary \ncondition at the corners, while the applied uniform traction enforces non zero shear stress \nboundary conditions at the same places. When the traction is applied with parabolic \nvariation, yielding zero shear stress boundary conditions at the corners, local refinement in \ndoes not occur in these areas. This is demonstrated by analyses B through E. \nIn both analysis A and B, where full restraint is provided to the left hand end, stress \nconcentrations occur in the top and bottom left hand corners, and non-zero vertical stresses \noccur over the depth of the beam at the left hand end. The resulting shear stress distribution \nexhibits singularities at the top and bottom corners. This complex stress field causes a \nsignificant amount of adaptive refinement in this area. Within about D\/2 of the left hand \nsupport, the shear and vertical stress distributions show little similarity to the Timoshenko \nsolution. Consequently any attempt to use the Timoshenko solution to evaluate the accuracy \n6 \n \n \nof the adaptive solution in this area will clearly yield misleading results. \nIn analysis C, vertical restraint is provided only at the mid-depth of the beam at the left hand \nend, while horizontal restraint is provided throughout the depth. This removes the vertical \nstress component, and improves the agreement of the horizontal stresses with the \nTimoshenko solution. However, the variation of the shear stress over this boundary varies \nconsiderably from the Timoshenko problem, and contains a singularity at the point of \nvertical restraint. This causes significant refinement in this area of the beam during the \nadaptive analysis, and again considerable difference between the Timoshenko solution and \nthe correct solution of the problem with these boundary conditions in the area x < D\/2. \nIn analysis D, in addition to the boundary conditions applied in analysis C, vertical traction \nequal to the Timoshenko solution (i.e. varying parabolically) is applied to the right hand end. \nThis means that the vertical restraint at the mid-depth serves simply to stabilise the solution, \nand carries no vertical load. This improves the solution considerably, and with a 1% error \ntarget leads to uniform refinement. However, some variation of the internal shear stress near \nthe support is evident. (This variation is subtle. The contour lines diverge slightly at the \nrestrained left hand end.) Non-zero vertical stresses are also present, and we have found that \nas the error target is made more severe, local refinement occurs in this region, and the \nvertical and shear stress distributions are notably different from the Timoshenko solution. \nIn analysis E, the displacements at the support are prescribed to agree precisely with the \nTimoshenko solution. (An alternative approach would be to provide vertical restraint at the \nmid-depth of the beam and horizontal restraints at the top and bottom corners, then apply \nhorizontal and shear tractions to the end in accordance with the Timoshenko solution. The \nfinal results would be the same.) In this case the solution converges quickly to the \nTimoshenko solution, and there are no regions which induce preferential refinement of the \n7 \n \n \nmesh. This is consistent with the exact cubic variation of displacement through the depth of \nthe beam being approximated by quadratic shape functions at all cross-sections of the beam. \nIn contrast to analysis D, the shear stress contours plotted in Figure 3 are horizontal along \nthe entire length of the beam. \nThese observations are confirmed when the stresses at the support are examined in detail. \nFigure 4 shows plots of the three stress components though the cantilever depth at x = 0. The \nhorizontal axis on these plots represents the y-axis in Figure 1. These plots demonstrate the \nagreement between the exact solution of [1] and analysis E, and the lack of agreement for all \nother analyses. Notably, when the support is treated as fully-fixed, the horizontal stress \ndistribution varies significantly from the linear variation of the Timoshenko solution, \nparticularly near the corners.  The most significant differences occur in the shear stress \ndistribution, indicating that the distribution of shear stress required to satisfy the Timoshenko \nassumption does not result naturally from any conventional boundary conditions, and must \nbe imposed artificially. Analysis D, when the Timoshenko shear stress is applied but when \nthe prescribed displacements in the x direction are not consistent with the Timoshenko \nsolution (and are instead zero), yields the closest agreement to analysis E. However, \ndifferences in both the vertical and shear stress are still evident.  \nThe variation of stress through the depth of the beam at x = L\/2 was also investigated, but is \nnot plotted since for all analyses all three stress components are indistinguishable from the \nexact solution, a point discussed further below. This is also evident from Figure 3, where the \nshear stress distribution in the middle of the beam appears identical in all cases, despite the \nvariation in boundary conditions at the end, clearly demonstrating St Venant\u2019s principle. \nNo attempt to measure effectivity index \u03b8 is necessary here since, as explained above, such a \nmeasure is meaningless for analyses A to D inclusive; the true \u201cexact\u201d solution one would \n8 \n \n \nuse to determine \u03b8  is not available. When \u03b8  has been measured in previous work, the fact \nthat the exact solution in [1] is incompatible with the numerical model is obvious at the \nsupports, see for instance Figure 3 of [2]. \n5. REALISTIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS \nIn reality, the boundary conditions applied to the cantilevers in analyses A to E above are \nnever fully realised. The support is never rigid and could certainly never impose the essential \nboundary conditions required to match the Timoshenko cantilever in [1].  Equally, realistic \nloads are unlikely to be the same as the required traction boundary conditions or indeed \napplied as true point loads.  \nDespite this it is still possible to obtain some agreement with the exact solution in [1]. Figure \n5 shows a finite element model of a cantilever that approaches the conditions expected in \nreality. The essential boundary conditions are no longer imposed at x = 0 but are modelled as \nadditional elements of the same stiffness. The load is applied in a more realistic location and \ndistributed over a small area. All other aspects of this model match those in analyses A-E \nabove. Figure 6 shows the stress results for this model, overlain on the final refined mesh \nusing the same error criterion as above. At locations away from the essential and traction \nboundary conditions, the fields in all cases are smooth and match the exact solution of [1], \nmuch as was found in analyses A-D. The realistic cantilever shows particular concentrations \nof shear stress at the sharp \u201ccorners\u201d at the support, most closely matching the results found \nhere for analysis A, where the support is fully fixed. \n6. CONSEQUENCES FOR ADAPTIVITY, VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION. \n The analyses A to D presented above, using boundary conditions that do not match the \nanalytical solution of Timoshenko, can still be used to test adaptive procedures. Comparison \n9 \n \n \ncan be made with a fine reference mesh to demonstrate convergence of an adaptive \nprocedure. However it should be noted that for problems with rigid fixities (such as A and B \nabove) the corner singularites that arise can never be captured precisely by the reference \nsolution. The use of realistic boundary conditions described in Section 5 leads to less \nintensive singularities and could therefore be regarded as better suited for testing an adaptive \nprocedure without using an analytical solution.  \nVerification and validation (V&V) of computational methods in science and engineering is \nan increasingly important concern [17, 18] and particularly so in finite element codes [19]. \nVerification has been described as \u201csolving the equations right\u201d in which the code is checked \nfor bugs, but more importantly is checked against analytical solutions where these are \navailable. Validation checks if the code provides predictions in line with experimental data, \nsometimes described as \u201csolving the right equations\u201d. To end this paper on a positive note, \nthe Timoshenko problem with the boundary conditions correctly modelled clearly provides a \nmeans of FE code verification where an analytical solution is vital (the Method of Exact \nSolutions). \n7. CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has examined the effect of boundary conditions on the correct solution for a \ncantilever beam problem. Replication of the solution of Timoshenko and Goodier is shown \nto require implementation of precise prescribed displacements (both horizontal and vertical) \nat the built in end incompatible with normal support conditions, in addition to application of \nvertical load as a shear traction varying parabolically over the depth. There are many \nexamples in the literature where this has not been done correctly. This paper has clearly \nillustrated the deviations from the Timoshenko solution caused by various boundary \ncondition combinations used in the literature. When the boundary conditions are applied \n10 \n \n \ncorrectly, the optimum mesh or grid for solution of the problem is always uniform. The \nTimoshenko and Goodier [1] solution for a cantilever beam is therefore unsuitable as a test \nproblem for adaptive procedures. A realistic model of a cantilever which includes a support \nregion of finite stiffness and the application of load over a finite area has been presented. \nSuch a model is an ideal benchmark problem for adaptive analysis, as there are three isolated \nareas where the exact stress field varies rapidly, together with an area where the solution is \nvery smooth. Unfortunately no exact solution is available for this problem, but a very fine \nsolution can always be used in place of the exact solution to ascertain the error level. Such a \nprocedure is far more satisfactory than comparing a numerical solution to an exact solution \nfor a problem with different boundary conditions, as has been done all too often in the past. \nREFERENCES \n1.
