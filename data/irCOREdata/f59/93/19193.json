Prevalence figures for hip osteoarthritis\nrange from 7\u201325% in people aged over fifty five [2] with\nover 70% of sufferers experience pain and limitations in\nperforming activities of daily living, such as mobility out-\nside the home [3]. Effective treatment exists for end-stage\ndisease in the form of joint arthroplasty [4]. The number\nof primary total hip replacements procedures for osteoar-\nthritis continues to rise steadily with 51,981 procedures\nreported for England and Wales in 2006 [5]. Traditionally,\nphysiotherapy has been a routine component of patient\nrehabilitation following hip joint replacement. Due to the\nintroduction of initiatives such as integrated care path-\nways, the length of hospital stay following joint replace-\nment surgery has markedly and rapidly decreased [6],\nwith the duration period for post operative in-patient\nphysiotherapy being reduced. For patients without inca-\npacitating systemic or life threatening disease the average\nlength of stay in hospital between 2003\u20132006 was 7.4\u2013\n8.9 days in England and Wales [6]. It is known that\nimpairments and functional limitations remain a year\nafter surgery [7] so the effectiveness of post discharge\nphysiotherapy upon functional ability after hip replace-\nment is a valid question. Current uncertainty regarding\neffectiveness makes it difficult for primary care commis-\nsioning organisations to determine whether to provide a\npost discharge physiotherapy service to patients, for pri-\nmary health care practitioners advising patients regarding\nfollow up after discharge and for patients making deci-\nsions about their own health care. Several general reviews\nof the literature surrounding rehabilitation following hip\njoint replacement exist [7-9] and one recent review, lim-\nited to Medline and Cochrane databases, for literature\nregarding physical training before and after hip and knee\narthroplasty [10]. This narrative review was date limited\n(1996\u20132006), did not include physiotherapy\/physical\ntherapy as a search term, did not search other databases\nlikely to contain allied health professional research\nrecords and did not identify the majority of trials included\nin this review. Since Dauty et al (1997) [10] considered\nphysical training rather than physiotherapy practice there\nhave not been, as yet, any systematic reviews exploring the\neffectiveness of post discharge physiotherapy following\nhip joint replacement surgery. We aimed to review, sys-\ntematically, randomised controlled trials in order to\nanswer the following question 'To what extent is post dis-\ncharge physiotherapy exercise effective, in terms of\nimproving function, quality of life, mobility, range of hip\njoint motion and muscle strength, for osteoarthritic\npatients following elective primary unilateral total hip\narthroplasty?'\nMethods\nEthical Approval\nThe Oxford Local Research Ethics Committee awarded\napproval for this study (AQREC No: A03.018).\nSearching\nIn March 2005 and April 2007 we identified clinical trials\nby simultaneously searching AMED (from 1985),\nCINAHL (from1982), EMBASE (from1974), KingsFund\nDatabase (from1979) and MEDLINE (from 1966). The\nCochrane library, PEDro physiotherapy evidence database\nand The Department of Health National Research Register\nwere also searched. In July 2005 and April 2007 we hand\nsearched Physiotherapy (1985\u2013March 2007 inclusive),\nPhysical Therapy (1985\u2013April 2007 inclusive) to double\ncheck for trials. The conference proceedings in the Journal\nof Bone and Joint Surgery (Britain) (1985\u20132006 inclusive)\nwere also handsearched, as were the reference lists of\nincluded trials. The location of Physiotherapy trials is dif-\nficult therefore, although time consuming, multiple gen-\neral searches were considered the optimum location\nmethod. This review is part of a series with both knee and\nhip search terms being included. Searches are summarised\nin Table 1. No language restrictions were applied. Profes-\nsional translation of non English language articles was\nobtained using a translation service familiar with medical\nterminology.\nSelection\nWe sought prospective comparative clinical trials of\npatients undergoing total hip replacement for osteoarthri-\ntis who received a physiotherapy exercise rehabilitation\nintervention following discharge from hospital post-oper-\natively. We used broad definitions of \"physiotherapy\" and\n\"exercise\" to include any exercises or exercise programme\nadvised or provided by physiotherapists\/physical thera-\npists during the rehabilitative period after discharge from\nhospital after surgery occurring in the out patient, com-\nmunity or home setting. This is not to say other forms of\nexercise are considered lesser in any way, only that our\narea of interest was physiotherapy practice. Trials were\nincluded if they compared a physiotherapy intervention\nversus usual or standard care or compared two different\ntypes of relevant physiotherapy intervention. We excluded\ntrials in which the intervention consisted of an electrical\nadjunct to physiotherapy. Effectiveness outcomes\nincluded in trials were measures of functional activities of\ndaily living, walking, self report measures of quality of\nlife, muscle strength and range of hip joint motion. As\nmost trials use functional measures, which include pain,\nrather than specific pain outcomes, it was not considered\npossible to include pain as a separate effectiveness out-\ncome. Study eligibility was assessed and agreed by two\nreviewers (CML and CS).Page 2 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:98 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/98Table 1: Search Strategy for Systematic Review.\nSource Searches and Search Terms Mar\u2013Jul 2005 Hits* \n(number of new relevant records)\n2005\u2013April 2007 Hits* \n(number of new relevant records)\nKA24:\nAMED 1985 -\nCINAHL 1982-\nEMBASE 1974-\nKingsfund 1979-\nMEDLINE 1966-\n1. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"replacement\" OR \n\"arthroplast$\" (whole document)\nAND \"rehabilitation\" AND \"trial$\" \n(whole document)\n587 (25) 180 (0)\n2. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"replacement\" OR \n\"arthroplast$\" (whole document)\nAND \"rehabilitation\" AND \"trial$\" \n(title)\n118 (11) 1 (0)\n3. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"replacement\" OR \n\"arthroplast$\" (whole document)\nAND \"physiotherapy\" AND \n\"trial$\" (title)\n2 (0) 4 (0)\n4. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"replacement\" OR \n\"arthroplast$\" (whole document)\nAND \"physiotherapy\" (title)\n39 (0) 14 (0)\n5. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"replacement\" OR \n\"arthroplast$\" (whole document)\nAND \"physical therapy\" (title)\n43 (8) 15 (0)\n6. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"replacement\" OR \n\"arthroplast$\" (whole document)\nAND \"home programme\" (title)\n2 (0) 1 (0)\n7. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"replacement\" OR \n\"arthroplast$\" (whole document)\nAND \"home programme\" \n(whole document)\n22 (2) 27 (0)\n8. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"replacement\" OR \n\"arthroplast$\" (whole document)\nAND \"occupational therapy \" \n(whole document)\n35 (0) 3 (0)\n9. \"hip\" OR \"knee\" \n(whole document)\nAND \"occupational therapist$\" \n(title)\n0 (0) 3 (0)\nCochrane library:\nCochrane reviews\nCCRCT DARE\n1.

Similar analysis of\nindividual quality components is a previously used\napproach within physiotherapy reviews [13,14] and is\nadvocated to avoid known problems associated with exist-\ning composite scores [15]. Items could be marked as yes,\nno, unclear or partial. Items were only marked as yes if\nthey fully and explicitly met the detailed criteria laid out\nin the CONSORT standards [11]. Two non English lan-\nguage trials were identified and translated, one of which\nwas written up in summary form rather than as a journal\npaper and could not be included in this assessment of\nquality for the review [16]. Two reviewers independently\nextracted the data (CML and KB). KB was masked to the\nkey details of each English language paper and the extent\nto which masking was successful was assessed. The two\nnon English trials were excluded from this masked moni-\ntoring process since the translations arrived in non journal\nformat after this process was completed. The masking\nrates were 83.33% for authors, 33.33% for journals, and\n100% for author affiliations, funding sources, and study\nlocation; all rates were considered successful bar journal\nof publication. The level of agreement between reviewers,\nusing the component checklist, was 70.45%, (kappa\n0.570, intraclass correlation coefficient (2,1) 0.699 (95%\nCI 0.606 to 0.770).\nAny initial disagreements regarding study quality were\ndiscussed until consensus was reached. Major disagree-\nment was rare, usually disagreement was the more minor\n\"yes\" to \"partial\/unclear\" or \"no\" to \"partial\/unclear\" and\n100% agreement was obtained. A third reviewer (CS) was\navailable in the event of consensus not being reached but\nin the event this was not required. Where key study details\nwere absent or unclear the authors were contacted for fur-\nther information.\nThe quality of the studies evaluated in this review was\nmixed and generally poor (Table 2) with much relevant\n2.

Consideration\nwas paid to the likelihood of serious potential bias being\ncreated throughout the assessment of quality decision\nmaking processes and this was taken into account when\nassessing individual trials. Only two papers were judged\nto be of sufficient quality to have been fully able to\ninclude in explanatory meta-analyses (with appropriate\nsensitivity analyses for blinding) if differing outcomes had\nnot prevented these from occurring (Table 2). Problems\nexisted within essential areas of trial quality in some trials.\nWhile one trial accurately identified itself as a non ran-\ndomised trial [17] three others erroneously stated they\nwere randomised trials. Two of these studies alternately\nassigned participants [18,19] which, since alternation is a\nnon random \"deterministic\" approach [11], cannot be\nconsidered true randomisation. One further study\nassigned participants upon the basis of where they lived\n[20], another non random approach. Information pro-\nvided regarding allocation concealment was inadequate\nfor the majority of trials. Many studies either provided\ninadequate information regarding whether outcomes\nwere measured by an assessor blinded to treatment alloca-\ntion [17,21] or stated that such blind outcome measure-\nment could not take place [22,23]. Whilst more recent\ntrials were more likely to provide a justification of sample\nsize, sample sizes were generally small (see Additional file\n1) with most trials including fewer than forty subjects\n(range n = 20\u201358).\nQuantitative Data Synthesis\nDespite the mixed and generally poor quality of the trials\nand their diverse outcomes we decided that it would be\nhelpful to present a formal summary of the results where\nit was possible to perform such summaries. Sufficient data\nmade this possible for both walking speed and hip abduc-\ntor muscle strength but not function, range of joint\nmotion or quality of life. For walking speed we first syn-\nthesised the results within in each study using the meth-\nods described by Gleser and Olkin (1994) [24] and we\nthen combined these weighted mean differences to form\na conventional fixed effects meta-analytic summary.\nBecause we have no information about the correlation\nbetween measures within studies we carried out the anal-\nysis assuming a correlation of 0.8 and as a sensitivity anal-\nysis also used values of 0.2 and 0.5. For hip abductor\nmuscle strength we carried out a conventional fixed effects\nanalysis using standardised effect sizes. Since it is our\nobject to present a summary rather than to encourage gen-\neralisability beyond these studies we neither used random\neffects nor present a formal assessment of heterogeneity.\nThe assessment of publication bias was felt to be inappro-\npriate due to the small number of trials available for inclu-\nsion in the review.\nResults\n27 potentially relevant studies were identified and\nscreened for retrieval. Of these, a total of 8 studies [16-23]\nwere included in the systematic review. A summary is pro-\nvided in the flow diagram in Figure 1. Table 3 contains a\nlist of excluded studies [25-43].\nStudy Characteristics\nThe characteristics of the studies included in the trial are\nsummarized in a table in Additional file 1. This table pro-\nvides information regarding the participants, the interven-\ntions, the main outcomes and the conclusions reached by\nthe authors.\nSummary of the Interventions and Comparisons\nDetails of the intervention and comparison groups were\navailable from the papers and authors and these are sum-\nmarised in a table in Additional file 2. The interventions\nprovided to participants in the trials included in this\nreview showed variation. One trial intervention consisted\nof a home exercise programme [17], one intervention was\na home exercise programme with follow up visits to check\nand progress exercises [23], another also included a home\nexercise programme but with additional visits and tele-\nphone calls where necessary [18].

This ranged from aerobic dance\nroutines [20] to individualised physiotherapy treatment\n[16] to group training [19] to supervised strengthening\nsessions [22] and supervised exercising sessions plus\nhome exercises [21]. The majority of trials allocated par-\nticipants to intervention or control groups [16-18,20,21].\nThree trials, occurring soon after surgery, compared the\nintervention group against an intervention based on usual\ncare. These were described as traditional isometric and\nactive range of movement exercises [23], a home exercise\nprogramme [19] and standard rehabilitation [22].\nThe timing of the intervention also varied. Some interven-\ntions started soon after surgery [22], and five weeks [16]\nand eight weeks [19] after discharge from hospital, while\nothers took place up to several years post operatively\n[17,18].\nThe duration of interventions provided to trial partici-\npants ranged from 5\u20138 weeks [16,17,21,23] to pro-\ngrammes lasting around three to four months [18-20,22].\nThe frequency of physiotherapy ranged from daily\n[16,17,22] to 1\u20134 times per week [16,19-21,23]. Partici-\npants were usually followed up immediately post inter-\nvention with no long term follow up, except for Kaae et al,\n1989 [16] who additionally included a 6 month follow up\n(additional file 1).\nTrial Flow diagram to summarise the stages of the systematic reviewFigure 1\nTrial Flow diagram to summarise the stages of the systematic review.\n \nCitations identified by all searches  (n=1351)  \n \n                                                                  Rejected on title, abstract and keywords (n=1299) \n \nCitations only relevant to knee review removed (n=25)  \n \n \nPotentially relevant RCT abstracts identified and screened for retrieval (n=27) \n                                                                          13 abstracts excluded (see Table 3) \n                                                                                   n= 5 not a rct \n                                                                                   n= 4 inpatient intervention \n                                                                                   n=2 duplicate trial reports  \n                                                                                   n=1 osteopathic manipulation intervention \n n= 1 pre op and post op intervention  \n \nFull papers obtained and screened for retrieval (n=14) \n                                                                                     6  papers excluded \n      n= 1 preoperative intervention \n                                                               n= 3 inpatient intervention   \nn=1 not a trial \n     n = 1 patients with injurious falls \nRCTs evaluated in detail (n=8) \n \n \n \nRCTs suitable for inclusion\/part              RCTs excluded from meta-analysis (n=6) \ninclusion in meta-analysis (n=2) Page 8 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:98 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/98Self Report measures of Function (5 trials, 190 \nparticipants)\nSix studies reported results for functional activity meas-\nures [16-19,21,23]. The measures used included the fol-\nlowing: The Oxford Hip Score [23], The McMaster\nToronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Question-\nnaire (MACTAR) [19], the functional component of the\nHarris Hip Score [18], Unspecified activities of daily liv-\ning\/patterns of activity self report measures [16,21] and\nthe Japanese Orthopaedic Score [17]. It can be seen that\nevery study measured function differently and we felt that\nthere was too much variety to usefully combine the results\nin a meta-analytic summary.\nWithin the individual trials, three demonstrated no\nobserved significant differences between groups\n[16,19,21] while one trial used the score to describe the\ngroup characteristics at baseline [17]. Two recent trials\n[18,23] showed significant within group differences for\nthe treatment arm only, indicating a treatment benefit\nwithin the treatment groups. Trudelle-Jackson and Smith,\n2004[23] report a pre-intervention median Oxford Hip\nScore of 21 (range 15\u201333) and post-intervention median\nof 16 (range 12\u201338) for the treatment arm; Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test results revealed a significant difference z =\n-2.55, p = 0.01. Jan et al, 2004 [18] report functional com-\nponent Harris Hip Score pre and post intervention means\nfor their high compliance group of 11.7 (SD \u00b1 0.8) and\n13.1 (SD \u00b1 0.6) respectively; Wilcoxon signed-rank test\nresults reported a significant difference at p < 0.05 level. A\npersonal communication from the authors reports the sig-\nnificant results (p < 0.05) for the exercise group as a\nwhole; namely a pre intervention mean of 11.8 (\u00b1 0.8)\nand post mean of 12.9 (\u00b1 0.6).\nWalking (6 trials, 212 participants)\nSome form of walking outcome measurement was used in\nsix trials [16-21] although the means by which walking\nwas measured varied. Mean \"comfortable\" walking speed\nover an unspecified time\/distance measured in m\/sec was\nmeasured in one trial [20]. Walking speeds in m\/min were\nprovided in two trials [17,18]. Jan et al, 2004 [18] meas-\nured fast and free walking speeds on hard and grass sur-\nfaces plus free walking speed measured on a spongy\nsurface, whilst Sashika et al, 1996 [17] provided no fur-\nther details of the test. Maximum walking speeds were\nprovided in two trials [19,21]. Few procedural details were\nprovided by Johnsson et al, 1998 [21] while Nyberg and\nKreuter, 2002 [19] measured self selected maximum walk-\ning speed in seconds over a 30 m walkway. A twelve\nminute stamina walking test, without walking aids, on a\ntreadmill was used by Kaae et al, 1989 [16]. In addition,\ncadence [17] and subjective gait analyses were included in\none trial each [16].\nThe results from these trials are mixed. No significant dif-\nferences were observed between groups in 2 trials [19,21].\nObserved differences between groups were noted in walk-\ning stamina by Kaae et al, 1989 [16] and found to be sig-\nnificant in another trial (p < 0.05) [20]. In this trial, by\nPatterson et al, 1995, walking speed (m\/sec) changed\nfrom a baseline mean of 1.28 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.38) to\n1.41 (95% CI 1.31 to 1.51) post intervention for the inter-\nvention group and from 1.25 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.36) to\n1.20 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.36) for the control group.\nIn addition, significant differences within interventions\ngroups within a trial were observed within 2 trials [17,18].\nSashika et al, 1996 [17] report significant (p < 0.05) mean\nchanges from 60.1 m\/min to 63.6 m\/min for group 1\n(Table 1), and from 64.4 m\/min to 69 m\/min for group 2.\nControl group changes (non significant) were slower\nthroughout from 57.4 m\/min to 58.7 m\/min. Jan et al,\n2004 [18] report significant results for all forms of walk-\ning measured within the high compliance subgroup.\nHowever, within the exercise group as a whole, significant\npre and post intervention differences (p < 0.05) were\npresent for fast walking on level ground (pre intervention\nmean 86.8 m\/min, SD \u00b1 8.4 and post intervention mean\n94.6 m\/min, SD \u00b1 16.8) and fast walking on grass (pre\nintervention mean 77.7 m\/min, SD \u00b1 8.1 and post inter-\nvention mean 84.4 m\/min, SD \u00b1 10.2). Free walking and\nwalking on spongy surfaces results were not significant\n(personal communication).\nFigure 2 presents the results of the quantitative analysis of\nwalking speeds. The top part presents the results for each\nstudy for each measure considered, and for Sashika et al,\n1996 [17] it shows the results of splitting the treatment\ngroup (as reported in the publication) as well as that of\npooling it. The next part of the figure shows the summa-\nrised effect within each study (where appropriate). It is\nthese four effects which are the subject of the meta-analy-\nsis. We have assumed that the correlation between each\nmeasure within each study was 0.8. The final part of the\nfigure presents our summary values from the meta-analy-\nsis. The top one is for a correlation of 0.8 and the other\ntwo represent our sensitivity analysis assuming correla-\ntions of 0.2 or 0.5. As can be seen the substantive conclu-\nsion is similar but the smaller the within study correlation\nthe more striking the overall summary appears and we\nhave therefore chosen the more conservative value for our\npresentation.\nRange of joint motion (4 trials, 134 participants)\nRange of motion was used as an outcome measure in four\ntrials [16,17,19,21]. Johnsson et al, 1998 [21] measured\npassive hip flexion, extension defect, abduction and\nadduction. Nyberg and Kreuter, 2002 [19] measured pas-\nsive hip flexion, extension, abduction and internal rota-Page 9 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:98 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/98tion using a goniometer for all measurements. Kaae et al,\n1989 [16] provide few details regarding measurement.\nSashika et al, 1996 [17] evaluated hip range of motion\nfinding that hip flexion did not improve significantly\nwithin any groups. No significant differences between\ngroups for hip joint range of motion were reported in the\nremaining three trials [16,19,21] and the lack of reported\ndata prevented a useful meta-analytic summary.\nMuscle strength (6 trials, 207 participants)\nMuscle strength was used as an outcome measure in six\ntrials [16-18,21-23] and, once again, methodologies var-\nied. Isometric quadriceps muscle force measurements,\nmeasured using dynamometry, were obtained by Suetta et\nal, 2004 [22], who used a maximal voluntary contraction\napproach, and Sashika et al, 1996 [17], who measured hip\nabductor maximal isometric torque. Johnsson et al, 1998\n[21] also measured isometric muscle strength, of hip flex-\nors, extensors, abductors and adductors and knee exten-\nsors and flexors, but used a different approach\nincorporating a strain gauge. Jan et al, 2004 [18] again\nused dynamometry, this time to measure isokinetic hip\nabductor, flexor and extensor muscle strength. Trudelle-\nJackson and Smith, 2004 [23], used a BEP-IIIa force trans-\nducer and measured hip flexor, hip extensor, hip abductor\nand knee extensor muscle strength via a \"make test\".\nFinally both Kaae et al, 1989 [16] and Sashika et al, 1996\n[17] used manual muscle testing.\nIn summary, no differences between groups were\nobserved in 2 studies [16,21]. Statistically significant dif-\nferences (p < 0.05) between and within groups were\nobserved in one study [22]. Baseline quadriceps isometric\nstrength mean values (operated leg) were 122.9 Nm (SE \u00b1\n17.2) for the intervention group and 119.2 (SE \u00b1 15.9) for\nthe standard rehabilitation group. At 12 weeks these val-\nues had changed to 119.2 Nm (SE \u00b1 17.8) for the interven-\ntion group and 117.4 (SE \u00b1 13.8) for the standard group.\nBetween group significant differences (p < 0.05) were also\npresent for vastus lateralis mean average voltages, using\nEMG, again in favour of the intervention group. Within\ngroup significant differences were also observed within\nMeta-analytic summary for walking speedFigure 2\nMeta-analytic summary for walking speed.

Within the intervention group, hip flexors =\n24.4%, hip extensors = 47.8, hip abductors = 41.2% and\nknee extensors = 23.4%; all statistically significant\nchanges (p < 0.05) which demonstrated improved muscle\nstrength. Whereas no significant differences occurred\nwithin the control group; hip flexors = 7.2% change, hip\nextensors = 3.6%, hip abductors = 3.3% and knee exten-\nsors = 1%. Jan et al (2004) [18] demonstrated hip abduc-\ntor, flexor and extensor muscle strength (operated side) to\nbe significantly different (p <0.05) between pre and post\nintervention time points within the exercise group but not\nwithin the control group (personal communication). Hip\nabductor mean values were 53.5 Nm (SD \u00b1 18.4) pre\nintervention and 59.9 (SD \u00b1 18.2) post intervention for\nthe intervention group and 55.7 (SD \u00b1 17.7) and 52 (SD\n\u00b1 21) for the control group. Hip flexor strength was 49.2\nNm (SD \u00b1 19.2) pre intervention and 54.5 (SD \u00b1 17) post\nintervention within the intervention group and 54.2 (SD\n\u00b1 22.5) and 50.8 (SD \u00b1 21.2) within the control group.\nHip extensor mean values were 71.4 Nm (SD \u00b1 23.4) pre\nintervention and 76.1 (SD \u00b1 24.9) post intervention for\nthe intervention group and 74.8 (SD \u00b1 31.1) and 72.5 (SD\n\u00b1 24.2) for the control group. When the results were fur-\nther broken down to reflect high and low compliance sub-\ngroups [18], both operated and non operated sides\ndemonstrated significantly different pre and post inter-\nvention values within the intervention group.\nFigure 3 presents the results of the quantitative analysis of\nhip abductor muscle strength for studies including suffi-\ncient data. The summary suggests that physiotherapy exer-\ncise shows promise in increasing hip abductor strength for\nthis patient group. There were insufficient studies includ-\ning hip extensor and hip flexor strength to make meta-\nanalytic summaries useful for these muscle groups.\nQuality of Life (1 trial, 55 participants)\nA 0\u2013100 mm visual analogue scale to measure quality of\nlife was used in one trial [19]. No significant differences\nbetween the groups were demonstrated.\nDiscussion\nSummary of principal findings\nThis systematic review finds that it is not yet possible to\nestablish the extent to which post discharge physiotherapy\nexercise is effective, in terms of improving function, qual-\nity of life, mobility, range of hip joint motion and muscle\nstrength, for osteoarthritic patients following elective pri-\nmary unilateral total hip arthroplasty. The diversity and\nlack of available trials plus the unsatisfactory quality of\nexisting trials prevent a definitive answer at this time. Tri-\nals provided mixed results and it would also be wrong to\nconclude at this time that post discharge physiotherapy is\nineffective, especially since the meta-analytic summaries\nof the data indicate promising potential benefit.\nStrengths and weaknesses of review procedures\nThe reviewers believe the search strategy to be comprehen-\nsive and to have been successful in locating relevant trials\nfor inclusion in the review. Physiotherapy literature\nremains a difficult area to search, with numerous biblio-\ngraphic data bases and un-indexed journals [44] and\nwhile every attempt was made to identify studies it is pos-\nsible other studies exist. However, this review remains the\nmost comprehensive to date.

The tri-\nals included in the review spanned nearly thirty years and\nit was noticeable that the more recent trials reported nec-\nessary information more clearly and comprehensively\nthan trials published many years previously. This may not\nbe a reflection on the quality of earlier trials as such, rather\nit may be that reporting habits and editorial requirements\nhave altered and improved over recent years, particularly\nsince the introduction of the CONSORT statement. Simi-\nlarly, more recent trials were more likely to justify their\nsample sizes and comment upon the power of their stud-\nies than earlier ones. The literature search for this review\nincluded trials up to April 2007 and is considered up to\ndate.\nThere were no apparent problems with the data extraction\nprocesses used in this review. Although many quality\nchecklists and scales exist, there is no accepted \"gold\nstandard\" score; component approaches are often pre-\nferred since the wide variety of scores and weighting sys-\ntems available mean that the same trial may score as both\nhigh quality and low quality depending on which score is\nused [15]. Additionally, many scoring systems downgrade\nthe quality rating of a trial if it is not double blinded. For\nmany physiotherapy trials, such as those in this review, it\nis inevitable that patients and therapists know whether\nthey are receiving the physiotherapy intervention or the\ncontrol and this is not an indication of low\/high trial\nquality. For these reasons, as previously [14], we used a\ncomponent approach although we accept this is a contro-\nversial area of debate.\nThe independent reviewers showed good percentage\nagreement with each other and moderate agreements\nwhen using Cohen's kappa [47] and the Intraclass Corre-\nlation Coefficient [48]. This level of initial agreement was\nconsidered acceptable since interpretation of some check-\nlist items, such as generalisability and overall evidence,\ncan be subjective. Following discussion both reviewers\nwere in full agreement for all items for all papers.\nWhere possible, a comprehensive description of trials\ninterventions has been presented for the majority of trials\n(additional file 2). It was not possible to obtain such\ndetails for all trials, particularly early trials where it was\nnot possible to track down author contact details. As is\noften the case with physiotherapy trials [49], the studies\nare small with 282 participants in eight studies. The\nnumber of available studies, and their size and quality,\ndoes limit this review. It is perhaps surprising that so few\npublished trials exist for such a common and longstand-\ning area of physiotherapy practice. This would seem to be\npartially attributable to the general lack of rehabilitation\nresearch undertaken on orthopaedic surgery patients post\ndischarge, rather than hip replacement patients per se,\nsince a recent search for knee replacement trials by the\nauthors revealed a similar lack of trials [14].\nIt was not possible to include pain as a main outcome in\nthis review since the studies identified in this review did\nnot tend to measure pain as a specific outcome. This does\nnot mean that pain is considered unimportant. Some\navailable functional measures include a pain subscale\nwhile others, such as the Oxford hip score, include pain as\na component within the score. The influence of pain on\nthe performance of objective measures also needs to be\nconsidered. However, the means by which pain is meas-\nured may, as in this review, make pain difficult to explore\nsystematically across studies.\nWe have tried to summarise the data fully, using meta-\nanalytic summaries where the data enabled us to do so\nappropriately [24] (Figures 2, 3). These figures are\nintended to helpfully summarise the data only; we\nemphasise that the mixed quality and diversity of trials in\nthis review prevented explanatory meta-analyses from\nbeing undertaken, since the results would risk being mis-\nleading or erroneous, and we do not intend these figures\nto be interpreted in this way.\nClinical implications\nThis review cannot remove the current uncertainty regard-\ning post discharge physiotherapy for this patient group,\nalthough it is useful in summarising the current available\nresearch, in highlighting the lack of existing evidence and\ndemonstrating the need for such evidence to be obtained.\nCommissioning organisations, health care practitioners\nand patients still lack conclusive evidence regarding effec-\ntiveness when deciding whether to provide\/attend post\ndischarge physiotherapy following elective primary hip\nreplacement for osteoarthritis. A systematic review includ-\ning meta-analyses for a similar question following knee\nreplacement [14] provided support for the use of physio-\ntherapy functional exercise interventions following dis-\ncharge to obtain short term benefit to patients following\nelective primary knee arthroplasty. Whilst differences\nbetween suitable activities and rehabilitation following\njoint replacement are recognised for knee and hip\npatients, many similarities remain [9] and these results\ncontribute to the argument for further trials for hip\nreplacement patients being necessary.\nFuture directions\nThe three trials incorporating home exercise programmes\n[17,23,23] demonstrated pre-post intervention differ-\nences within the intervention groups but not in the con-Page 12 of 14\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Musculoskeletal Disorders 2009, 10:98 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2474\/10\/98trols. These trials were for participants who had had their\nhip replacements some time previously rather than for\npeople recently discharged from hospital. Trials compar-\ning differences between groups would be valuable. As\nwould research to explore the optimum time-point at\nwhich to offer any additional post discharge physiother-\napy exercise intervention to patients. The trials which\nincluded out-patient individual or group training follow-\ning discharge tended to report between group differences\nwith generally negative results [16,19,21] however the\ntemptation to count up the number of these negative tri-\nals, rather than await future high quality trials, should be\navoided. Across the entire body of hip replacement\nknowledge, research indicates that hip replacement\npatients experience persistent functional and physical lim-\nitations at least one year post-operatively [8] when many\nfollow up studies cease obtaining outcome data. Whether\nphysiotherapy exercise post discharge can reduce such\nlimitations therefore remains an important question to\nadequately address. Recent research indicates that tradi-\ntional physiotherapy following lower limb joint replace-\nment, consisting of range of joint motion and isometric\nmuscle strengthening exercises plus transfer and gait\/\nwalking aid practice, may also be less effective than pro-\ngrammes incorporating a more functional, weight bearing\napproach to rehabilitation [7,23,50]. We believe it is both\ntimely and necessary for well conducted clinical trials\ninvestigating the effectiveness of physiotherapy exercise\ninterventions following discharge after elective primary\ntotal hip replacement surgery to take place for this com-\nmon area of clinical practice.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, insufficient evidence currently exists to\nestablish the effectiveness of physiotherapy exercise fol-\nlowing primary hip replacement for osteoarthritis.
