Bampfylde et al. \/ Ecological Modelling 188 (2005) 253\u2013278\nral scale to permit the role of recruitment limitation to\nbe evaluated (Clark et al., 1999). Much of the support\nfor the recruitment limitation hypothesis comes from\ntheoretical, especially mathematical modelling, stud-\nies. One model, developed by Tilman (1994) has been\nwidely invoked as demonstrating a putative mechanism\nfor the maintenance of high species richness and has\nbeen cited in support of the importance of recruitment\nlimitation in tropical rain forests (Hubbell et al., 1999;\nSvenning, 1999). Indeed, Tilman (1994) suggests that\nhis model provides an alternative explanation to that\nof the neutral theory proposed by Hubbell and Foster\n(1986) and Hubbell (2001) for species richness in trop-\nical forests.\nWe review Tilman\u2019s (1994) model, its formulation\nand results below. An analysis of the theoretical under-\npinning of this model shows that it is not appropriate\nfor the simulation of tropical rain forest tree species dy-\nnamics. We present an adaptation of Tilman\u2019s model for\nrain forest dynamics in which we make it impossible\nfor an individual tree to invade a space that is already\noccupied by another individual and we justify why we\nbelieve that this more accurately simulates observed\nprocesses of gap colonisation. We modify this model\nto permit a gap in the forest to be colonised by the\nfastest growing species present in the seedling bank at\nthat time. Finally, we incorporate mast-fruiting events,\ncharacteristic of rain forests in Southeast Asia, into our\nmodel, and describe the consequences of a progressive\ndecay in species colonisation rates (simulating the de-\nc\nt\n2\nc\nm\nL\nm\ns\nw\nd\nd\ni\nd\nv\n(colonisation) in each site. Similar models have also\nbeen applied to marine populations with sessile adult\ndynamics coupled to motile juvenile dynamics which\ncontribute to a larval pool able to colonise empty sites\nin the environment (for example, Roughgarden and\nIwasa, 1986). The additional complexity of the juvenile\nstage is not considered here. The important aspects of\nTilman\u2019s model are captured by the two-species model\nwhich we summarise below. For single and multiple\nspecies dynamics, we refer the reader to the original\ntext (Tilman, 1994).\n2.1. Competition between two species\nTilman models interspecific competition by first\nconsidering a two-species model in which the compe-\ntition is for habitat sites. He defines the superior com-\npetitor to be the one that always displaces the inferior\ncompetitor when they both occur in a site, and the infe-\nrior competitor can neither invade into nor displace the\nsuperior competitor from a site. In this case, he uses\nthe following equations to model the dynamics:\ndp1\ndt\n= c1p1(1 \u2212 p1) \u2212 m1p1, (1)\ndp2\ndt\n= c2p2(1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2) \u2212 m2p2 \u2212 c1p1p2, (2)\nwhere p1 denotes the proportion of the superior com-\npetitor. Note that the equation for the superior com-\np\ni\na\nh\nt\ni\n(\n2\nt\nt\ns\ns\np\nf\nfay in populations of species in the seedling bank over\nime between fruiting events).\n. Tilman\u2019s model of spatially structured\nompetition\nTilman\u2019s (1994) model is based on a well-known\netapopulation dynamics equation (Levins, 1969;\nevins and Culver, 1971), and is frequently used for\nodelling ecosystems. Considering a single sessile\npecies living in a habitat composed of distinct sites,\nhere a site can be occupied by at most one adult, the\neath of an adult opens up a gap for colonists. The\nynamics of site occupancy depends on the mortal-\nty rate and the colonisation rate of the species. The\nynamics of the entire habitat are the sum of the indi-\nidual processes of death (mortality) and replacementetitor (1) is as if it lived as a species on its own. The\nnferior competitor can only colonise sites where both it\nnd species 1 are absent (the (1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2) term in (2)),\nowever, species 1 can displace species 2 (the \u2212c1p1p2\nerm in (2)). Tilman shows that globally stable coex-\nstence is possible under certain parameter conditions\nTilman, 1994).\n.2. The applicability of Tilman\u2019s model to\nropical rain forest communities\nWe believe the use of Tilman\u2019s model for spa-\nially structured competition to explain rain forest tree\npecies diversity is inappropriate for a number of rea-\nons. Firstly, his assumptions that individuals can dis-\nlace each other is not realistic for most climax rain\norest species, however, relevant this may be elsewhere,\nor example, in grasslands. We address this assumption\nC.J. Bampfylde et al. \/ Ecological Modelling 188 (2005) 253\u2013278 255\nin Section 3. Secondly, Tilman\u2019s model is an equilib-\nrium model. It has been accepted that apparently stable\npopulations are not at equilibrium over some timescales\n(Hutchinson, 1961). One hypothesis for ecosystem di-\nversity is that it is maintained by recovery from distur-\nbances (Connell, 1978). It follows under this hypothe-\nsis, that an equilibrium model is not valid. However, in\norder to assess whether a model based on this simplifi-\ncation produces the correct type of dynamics, we adapt\nTilman\u2019s model in Section 3.1. But go on to develop a\nnon-equilibrium or dynamic equilibrium model (sensu\nHuston, 1979), where we search for a balance between\nproliferation and death of species between disturbance\nevents (Section 5).\n3. A new model for competition in rain forests\nTree regeneration in tropical rain forests is typically\nlight limited and most tropical rain forest trees require\nlight gaps in order to grow to maturity (Hartshorn,\n1978). Recent analyses of patterns of regeneration in\nnatural tropical rain forest light gaps (Whitmore and\nBrown, 1996; Delissio et al., 2002) have found that,\ncontrary to widely accepted generalisations, the dom-\ninance hierarchy in light gaps is a function of initial\nseedling size rather than competitive ability for light.\nCompetition for light in gaps is highly asymmetric.\nThe tallest individual at the time of gap creation will\nbenefit from increased levels of irradiance, regardless\no\nq\no\ni\ns\nf\nB\nt\ns\nT\nt\ni\na\na\nn\nM\no\net al., 1996) and may, over time, replace them in a\nsuccessional sequence (Kochummen, 1996; Whitmore,\n1998). In these circumstances, it may be legitimate to\npropose that there has been competitive displacement\nand that Tilman\u2019s (1994) model provides an adequate\ndescription. Our objective, however, is not to model this\ntype of secondary succession, but to evaluate mecha-\nnisms that will permit coexistence of species within the\nclimax guild that are similar in their ecology.\nIn order to increase the applicability of Tilman\u2019s\ntwo-species model to rain forest regeneration dynam-\nics, we have adapted it in two important ways. Firstly,\nwe have removed the \u2212c1p1p2 term in (2) that permits\na species to invade the space occupied by an inferior\ncompetitor and displace it. Secondly, we have intro-\nduced a component to our model that selects for the\nspecies, present at the time of gap formation, that has\nthe highest growth rate. We refer to this model as our\n\u201cexploitative competition model\u201d.\n3.1. Two-species model\n3.1.1. Model and determination of steady states\nThe two competing tree species model lends itself to\na complete mathematical study and will help in gaining\na deeper understanding of this type of interaction when\nwe incorporate more species.\nThe two-species system is:\ndp1\n1\nw\no\np\nc\ne\nm\n(f species. Those in its shade will not. As a conse-\nuence, initial differences in size are often sufficient to\nvercome any innate differences in competitive abil-\nty. When the outcome of competition for limiting re-\nources is determined by initial conditions, it is termed\nounder control (Keddy and Shipley, 1989). Rees and\nergelson (1997) have shown that asymmetric compe-\nition for light increases the likelihood that plants with\nimilar regeneration niches will be founder controlled.\nhe implication of this for rain forest tree dynamics is\nhat once an individual has established in a light gap\nt is unrealistic to assume that it can be displaced by\nnother individual that is a superior competitor.\nIt is well known that where big gaps are made in\ntropical rain forest, they are often colonised by pio-\neer tree species (sensu Swaine and Whitmore, 1988).\nany shade-tolerant climax tree species are capable\nf survival and growth beneath pioneer trees (Howlettdt\n= c1p1g \u2212 m1p1, (3)\ndp2\ndt\n= c2p2g(1 \u2212 p1) \u2212 m2p2, (4)\ndg\ndt\n= \u2212c1p1g \u2212 c2p2g(1 \u2212 p1) + m1p1 + m2p2,\n(5)\n= p1 + p2 + g, (6)\nhere p1(t) and p2(t) are the proportional abundances\nf species 1 and 2, respectively, at time t, and g(t) is the\nroportional abundance of available free space (gaps).\ni is the colonisation rate and mi is the mortality (local\nxtinction) rate of species i. We assume, for the mo-\nent, that the mi and ci are positive constants. Adding\n3)\u2013(5), we have that p1 + p2 + g = constant, which\n256 C.J. Bampfylde et al. \/ Ecological Modelling 188 (2005) 253\u2013278\nwe take to be 1 (since p1, p2 and g are proportions),\nleading to Eq. (6).\nSpecies 1 is defined to be the most competitive\nspecies, that is, the one whose seedlings will grow the\nfastest to reach the light (in a treefall gap). To derive Eq.\n(3), propagules are assumed to be dispersed randomly\namong all sites. The rate of propagule production by\nthe occupied sites of species 1, c1p1, is multiplied by\nthe proportion of sites that are unoccupied, g, to give\nthe rate of production of newly colonised sites (Law\nof Mass Action). The mortality rate, m1, is multiplied\nby the proportion of sites occupied by species 1, p1, to\ngive the rate at which the sites become vacant. A site\nis vacated when the individual occupying it dies.\nThe introduction of a second species does not affect\nthe dynamics of species 1, since the new species is an\ninferior competitor. We assume that the superior com-\npetitor always out-competes the inferior competitor if\nboth are present when a gap is formed. We capture\nthis behaviour phenomenologically by assuming that\nthe colonising power of species 2 in the presence of\nspecies 1 is c2p2(1 \u2212 p1). Multiplying this by the pro-\nportion of vacant sites g then gives us the first term on\nthe right-hand side of (4).\nEq.

The state (a) corresponds to both species dy-\ning out and no trees being present; (b) corresponds to\nspecies 1 being totally dominated by the less compet-\nitive species 2, only trees from species 2 are present\nand there is no coexistence. Similarly in (c), the more\ncompetitive species 1 dominates species 2 causing it to\ndie out completely. Finally in (d), both species coexist\nand both have a non-zero abundance at the steady state.\nIn a rain forest, many species coexist and it is a steady\nstate of type (d) that we are trying to reproduce. The\nstability and feasibility of these steady states will be\ninvestigated below.\n3.1.2. Linear stability analysis, stability and\nfeasibility of steady states\nWe now carry out linear analysis of the steady states\nin Table 1 in the standard way (see, for example, Jordan\nand Smith, 1988).\nThe Jacobian matrix, J2, of the system is given by:\uf8eb (\n2 \u2212 m1\nc1\n)\n\u2212c1p1\n1 \u2212 p2) c2\n(\n(1 \u2212 p1)(1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 2p2) \u2212 m2\nc2\n)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (9)\nevaluated at the steady state (p01, p02). The eigenvalues\nfor each steady state are calculated from d(\u03bb) = |J \u2212\n\u03bbI| = 0 and shown in Table 1.\nThe pi represent proportional abundances of rain\nforest tree species. Therefore, to be a feasible state, both\np and p must be non-negative. For example, steadydp1\ndt\n= c1p1(1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2) \u2212 m1p1, (7)\ndp2\ndt\n= c2p2(1 \u2212 p1 \u2212 p2)(1 \u2212 p1) \u2212 m2p2. (8)\nThe steady states of the system are found by setting:\ndp1\ndt\n= 0 = dp2\ndt\n.\nThe four possible steady states are given in Table 1. For\nease of notation, we define \u03b3i = mici for i = 1, 2.\nThe different steady states (or equilibrium points)\ncorrespond to different proportional abundances of the\nJ2 = \uf8ec\uf8ed c1 1 \u2212 2p1 \u2212 p\n\u2212c2p2(2 \u2212 2p1 2\nstate (a) is feasible for all values of \u03b31 and \u03b32. For steady\nstate (b), to be feasible, we require 1 \u2212 \u03b32 > 0, that is\n\u03b32 < 1, and similarly for steady state (c), we require\n\u03b31 < 1. For steady state (d), we need 1 \u2212 \u03b32\u03b31 > 0 and\n\u03b32\n\u03b31\n\u2212 \u03b31 > 0. Combining the two inequalities gives 0 <\n\u03b321 < \u03b32 < \u03b31 < 1.\nSteady states may be classified by their stability\neigenvalues. If there exists at least one eigenvalue with\nC.J. Bampfylde et al. \/ Ecological Modelling 188 (2005) 253\u2013278 257\nreal part greater than zero, then there are solutions that\nare growing exponentially and hence the steady state is\nlinearly unstable. In order for a steady state to be lin-\nearly stable, both eigenvalues must have negative real\nparts.\nThe results for feasibility and stability are sum-\nmarised in Fig. 1. From this figure, we see that linear\ntheory predicts that species coexistence cannot occur in\nthis model, i.e. the coexistence steady state is unstable\nfor all feasible parameter values.\nThe above analysis determines the local behaviour\nnear equilibria. To investigate the global behaviour, we\nconsidered the phase plane of the system. A detailed\nnumerical study of the phase plane for the full nonlin-\near model verifies the prediction that species coexis-\ntence cannot occur in this model. Within the parameter\nregime where coexistence in feasible but unstable, we\nobserve a separatrix in the phase plane dividing the tra-\njectories into the basins of attraction of the two stable\nsingle species steady states.\nWe conclude that the two-species model cannot ex-\nhibit the type of behaviour observed in the rain forest.\nWe now use the insights obtained from this model to in-\nvestigate the extension to the n-species model (7)\u2013(8).\n3.2. n-Species competition model\nWe now investigate an n-species competition model\nto determine whether multiple species (\u22653) coexis-\ntence can be stable.\n3.2.1.

These are\ncells that enable the immune system to respond more\nrapidly and with a stronger effect to re-exposure to anti-\ngens or pathogens (Yates and Callard, 2001; Callard et\nal., 2003).\nThe steady states are calculated in the same way as\nbefore by setting the right-hand side of Eq. (10) to zero\nafter eliminating g. However, for our purposes, we are\ninterested only in the steady state where all the species\nhave a non-zero abundance, that is all species coexist,\nbecause the aim of our model is to predict long-term co-\nexistence of rain forest tree species. In this case, the pro-\nportional abundances of the species are calculated to be:\nw\n3\nw\nb\nThe elements of Jn are calculated in Appendix B. We\nfind that the system of Eq. (13) for n > 1 tends to a\nsteady state with at most one species persisting, that\nis only one of the species is non-zero and all the other\nspecies die out (see Appendix B). The species that dom-\ninates will be determined by the initial conditions of the\nsystem. Hence, we have proved that our model does\nnot mimic the long-term coexistence and diversity ob-\nserved in the tropical rain forests. We need therefore\nto consider an alternative mechanism for simulating\nthis species richness. A possible new approach is the\ninclusion of fruiting events and non-constant colonisa-\ntion rates. We explore this later, but first we consider a\npre-emptive competition model.\n4. Colonisation model\n4.1. Description of the model\nThe idea that communities are assembled according\nto rules based on the ecological niches of the compo-\nnent species has recently been challenged by the pro-\nposal that changes in the abundance of populations and\nthe composition of communities are the consequence\nof ecological drift rather than competitive interactions\n(Hubbell, 1998). In order to examine the effect of there\nbeing no difference between species in their competi-\ntive ability, we have removed the\n(\n1 \u2212\u2211i\u22121j=1 pj) term\nfrom our original model (10).

Stability analysis\nTo find the general form of the Jacobian matrix, Jn,\ne rewrite the system of Eqs. (10)\u2013(12), replacing mi\nci\ny \u03b3i. We obtain the system:\ndpi\ndt\n= cipi\n(\n1 \u2212\nn\u2211\nk=1\npk\n)(\n1 \u2212\ni\u22121\u2211\nk=1\npk\n)\n\u2212 \u03b3icipi.\n(13)heir ability to colonise gaps. The competitive interac-\nions between species are pre-emptive. We have called\nhis our \u201ccolonisation model\u201d.\nThe system of equations for our colonisation model\nhen becomes:\ndpi\ndt\n= cipig \u2212 mipi, (14)\ndg\ndt\n= \u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\ncipig +\nn\u2211\ni=1\nmipi, (15)\n= g +\nn\u2211\ni=1\npi.

(17) over i, we see that:\ndP\ndt\n= cP(1 \u2212 P) \u2212 mP, (18)\nwhich is equivalent to Tilman\u2019s model for one species\nand has a stable steady state at P = 1 \u2212 m\nc\n. The model\nfor T memory cells in the immune system also consid-\ners this scenario (Yates and Callard, 2001; Callard et\nal., 2003).\nThe analysis of stability and feasibility for (17) is\nmuch simpler than for the competition model. We spare\nthe reader all of the details and simply summarise the\nresults. There are two cases:\n(1) The \u03b3i are all different: In this case, if \u03b3i > 1 for\nall i, then the trivial steady state, in which all the\nspecies are zero, is the only ecologically meaning-\nful steady state, and it is globally stable. If, how-\never, \u03b3i < 1 for a subset of the i values, then there is\na further set of steady states in which every species\nis zero, except forpi = 1 \u2212 \u03b3i. In this case, the triv-\nial steady state is no longer stable, and the non-zero\nsteady state that is linearly stable is the one with\nthe smallest \u03b3i.\n(2) A number of the \u03b3i are the same: Without loss of\ngenerality, assume that \u03b31 = \u03b32 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u03b3k = \u03b3 ,\nand all the other \u03b3i are different. Again, if all the\n\u03b3i and \u03b3 are greater than 1, then the trivial steady\nstate is the only meaningful one and it is globally\nstable. If \u03b3 < 1, but all other \u03b3i are greater than 1,\nthen the trivial steady state loses stability. There is\nnow a surface of steady states given by the set:\nS = {pj : p1 + p2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + pk = 1 \u2212 \u03b3,\npi > 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k;\npi = 0 for i = k + 1, . . . , n}.\nS is neutrally stable. Thus, if we make a perturba-\ntion from an equilibrium point in S to another point\nin S, the system will stay at the new point (which is\nan equilibrium point also). However, if the pertur-\nbation moves the equilibrium point off the surface\nS, then the dynamics of the system attracts the solu-\ntion back to an equilibrium point on the surface S.\nIf \u03b3 < 1 but one other \u03b3i < 1 for i > k, then there\nF ns.

The remaining regions are areas marked\negion with their stability. The steady states are as follows: (0, 0),\n260 C.J. Bampfylde et al. \/ Ecological Modelling 188 (2005) 253\u2013278\nis another steady state in which all the species are\nzero except for pi = 1 \u2212 \u03b3i. This new steady state\nis linearly stable if \u03b3i < \u03b3 , otherwise it is unstable.\nThe results for the stability of the steady states for\nthe specific case of the two-species colonisation model\nare summarised in Fig. 2. This can be compared to the\nfeasibility and stability regions in Fig. 1.\nNumerical simulations of the full nonlinear system\nsupport these results (Section 5.4 and Figs. 4\u20138). We\nconclude that this model could only possibly give\ncoexistence if some of the \u03b3i are equal. However, math-\nematically speaking, this is the case in which the system\nis structurally unstable, because any small change in\nthe \u03b3i totally changes the behaviour of the system. Such\nmodels are of limited validity in an ecological context.\nWe conclude that our colonisation model, like our\n(exploitative) competition model, does not adequately\nsimulate the processes that maintain high species di-\nversity.\n5. Fruiting events\n5.1. Motivation for model\nWe have demonstrated that the models described in\nSections 3 and 4 cannot support the stable coexistence\nof species assuming constant values of the prolifera-\ntion rates, ci. However, this assumption is unrealistic.\nSince very few tropical tree species fruit continuously\n(Lambert and Marshall, 1991) and seedling popula-\ntions will slowly decay (for an example, see Fig. 3),\nthe proliferation rate for any species is likely to be a\nfunction of the time since the last fruiting event. In\nthe New World tropics, the phenology of many trees\nis highly diverse (Newstrom et al., 1994). This im-\nplies that variations between species in propagule abun-\ndance and consequently in recruitment may be asyn-\nchronous and this will contribute to species coexistence\n(Chesson and Warner, 1981). Diverse phenology is not\nan appropriate assumption for Southeast Asian tropi-\ncal rain forests which are dominated by the Diptero-\ncarpaceae (Whitmore, 1984). An example of the pat-\nterns of mast (or gregarious) fruiting (Burgess, 1972)\nat supra-annual intervals can be seen in Curran et al.\n(1999, Fig. 1A). The timings of the fruiting events is\nobserved to be approximately periodic with a random\ncomponent (Yasuda et al., 1999), triggered by the El\nNin\u02dco Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Sakai et al., 1999).\nENSO is not strictly periodic (periodogram analysis; D.\nBebber, personal communication) although there is a\nstrong ENSO every 4\u20137 years (Webster and Palmer,\n1997; McPhaden, 1999a,b). In these years, seed and\nseedling survival are relatively high and mixed species\ncarpets of seedlings are formed often at densities of\nover one million per hectare. This unique feature of\nSoutheast Asian tropical rain forest makes it problem-\nF ent. Da\nM et al., 1\nH orensis\ns shows\nd of seedig. 3.

The inclusion of environmental\nvariance is shown to have a similar effect to the inclu-\nsion of another resource dimension to the niche space,\nthus providing opportunities for more species to coex-\nist.\nNumerical experiments have also been used to as-\nsess the effects of non-equilibrium conditions on com-\npeting species. Periodic population reductions have\nbeen used as an example of temporal heterogeneity\n(Huston, 1979). The length of the period of these re-\nductions is adjusted to find a dynamic equilibrium be-\ntween competitors. Doyle (1981) found that in order to\nreproduce Puerto Rican montane rain forest dynamics\ncorrectly, the disturbance effects of hurricanes needed\nto be included in his model. Doyle specified the ex-\npected reduction in species populations occurring in a\ngiven year.\nThe effects of a random frequency of disturbance\nevents have not been investigated. Our fruiting events\n(population inputs) are randomly spaced in time. We\naim to combine the above elements: randomness, ape-\nriodic disturbance events and variability (with time de-\np\ni\ni\na\nt\ni\ns\nh\ns\nr\nr\np\n1\ns\np\na\na\ntence in the forest understorey and those that enable fast\ngrowth in gaps. There is ample experimental evidence\nthat this type of trade-off exists (Bazzaz and Pickett,\n1980; Press et al., 1996). These more complex mod-\nels are analytically intractable, and we therefore resort\nto extensive numerical simulation to investigate their\nbehaviour within the parameter space.\n5.2. Description of model\n5.2.1. Colonisation rates\nThe number of seedlings, of any particular species,\ndecays with time over the course of a fruiting cycle.\nData collected indicates that this decay is exponential\n(Brown et al., 1999 and Fig. 3) and thus we take the\ncolonisation rates to be of the following form:\nci = \u03b1i e\u2212\u03b2it, (19)\nwhere \u03b2i is the decay rate of the seedling population\nof species i per year. The new meaning of ci is that it\nis the absolute colonisation power of species i, that is\nthe ability of a seedling of species i to establish itself\nin a site given that the species has been recruited to a\nsite. \u03b1i is the initial value of the colonisation power for\nspecies i at the start of every fruiting cycle.\n5.2.2. Model equations for the exploitative\ncompetition hypothesis with fruiting events\nOur new model for n species then becomes:\n1endent parameters).\nIn this section, we therefore introduce random fruit-\nng events and exponential seedling population decay\nnto both our competition and colonisation models, and\ngain investigate if these models will exhibit the long-\nerm coexistence and diversity observed in reality. As\nt is observed in the field that the seedling bank of each\npecies decays over time between fruiting events, we\nave changed the colonisation rates in the model (con-\ntant until this point) to decay over time at a different\nate for each species. We have selected a range of decay\nates that are consistent with field observations of the\nersistence of dipterocarp seedlings (Fox, 1976; Still,\n996; Whitmore and Brown, 1996) and assigned these\no that there is an inverse relationship between com-\netitive ability and the rate of population decay. This\nssumes that there is a trade-off between physiological\nnd morphological traits that enhance seedling persis-dp1\ndt\n= c1(t)p1g \u2212 m1p1, (20)\ndpi\ndt\n= ci(t)pig\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed1 \u2212 i\u22121\u2211\nj=1\npj\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\u2212 mipi, (21)\ndg\ndt\n= \u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0ci(t)pig\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed1 \u2212 i\u22121\u2211\nj=1\npj\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb+ n\u2211\ni=1\nmipi,\n(22)\ndci\ndt\n= \u2212\u03b2ici(t) + \u03b1i\u03b4(t \u2212 I), (23)\n= g +\nn\u2211\nj=1\npj, (24)\n262 C.J.

The model for n species\necomes:\ndpi\ndt\n= ci(t)pig \u2212 mipi, (30)\ndg\ndt\n= \u2212\nn\u2211\ni=1\n[ci(t)pig] +\nn\u2211\ni=1\nmipi, (31)\ndci\ndt\n= \u2212\u03b2ici(t) + \u03b1i\u03b4(t \u2212 I), (32)imic qualitatively the patterns he had observed in his\nrasslands.\nMore recently, further study and experiments have\neen devoted to determining competition coefficients\nparameters describing the competitive effect one\npecies has on another). In our model, this is incor-\norated into the colonisation rates. These parameters\nre difficult to measure due to the fact that plants need\no be grown in mixtures and separately to determine\nheir values (Freckleton and Watkinson, 2000, 2001;\neigelt and Jolliffe, 2003).

By\ncomparing the magnitude of proliferation (ci, \u03b1i, \u03b2i)\nand the decay (mi) parameters, we were able to deter-\nmine the likely range of each parameter based on the\nexperimental data available (more details of this cal-\nculation are given in Appendix D). We then explored\nthis space numerically to determine the effects of each\nof the parameters, and more particularly, whether any\nset of parameters could give long-term coexistence for\nlarge numbers of species in the presence of random\nfruiting events. The results are presented in Section\n5.4, for 2, 6 and 180 species.\n5.4. Numerical experiments\n5.4.1. Competition model\nOur system, Eqs. (27)\u2013(29), is solved over the length\nof a fruiting interval. The fruiting interval is a random\namount of time after which the seedling bank is replen-\nished and the ci (i = 1, . . . , n) are reset to their initial\nvalues, taking the current values of (p1, . . . , pn) as the\nnew initial conditions in order to solve the system over\nthe next interval.\nThe time between fruiting intervals is chosen uni-\nformly on the interval [3, 11]. This is equivalent to\nevents occurring on a periodic frequency with a ran-\ndom time component. This range of values agrees with\nexperimental data (Burgess, 1972), however, there is\nnot enough data available to determine the distribu-\ntion of masting events hence a uniform distribution is\ntaken. Further experiments using a normal distribution\nyielded similar results.\nThe system of nonlinear equations is solved using\nthe Matlab (MathWorks and Inc., 2002) ode45 (an\nexplicit, one-step Runge\u2013Kutta medium order (4\u20135)\nODE solver) from the odetoolbox (Shampine and\nReichelt, 1997).

Extensive numerical investigation of the param-\neter space has not yielded a parameter set that gives\nlong-term coexistence and the correct amount of free\nspace for 180 species. If we use realistic parameter\nvalues, one species quickly excludes the rest and co-\nexistence is not observed numerically (Fig. 5, bottom\npanel).\nClimax rain forest trees are ecologically very simi-\nlar and we would expect them to have broadly similar\nmortality and colonisation rates (parameters ci, \u03b1i, \u03b2i\nand mi in our models). However, our model required\na wide range of parameter values to simulate coexis-\ntence. The range is too great to be a likely description\nof rain forest species.\n5.4.2. Colonisation model\nFig. 7 shows the effect of constant colonisation\nand the absence of fruiting events on our colonisation\nmodel. The ci used are average values over an aver-\nage fruiting interval, given by c\u00afi as shown in Table\nE.2 (Appendix E).

In the bottom panel, the superior competitor (increasing line) reaches fixation. In each case, we see that\nthe superior competitor excludes less competitive species, while the timescale to fixation increases with the number of species included in the\nsimulation, and these timescales are longer than the corresponding timescales to extinction in Fig. 4. Note the logarithmic scale on the horizontal\n(time) axis.\nand inferior competitor dominates. The corresponding\nphase plane for each regime is also given. In Fig. 9B,\ntrajectories move towards both stable fixed points alter-\nnately, however, the random perturbations introduced\ninto the system are sufficient to halt competitive exclu-\nsion.\nIt is clear from the comparison of Fig. 5 with Fig. 8\nthat there is a balance between proliferation and death\nof each species: a dynamic equilibrium (sensu Huston,\n1979) for species within our colonisation model but not\nwithin our competition model. In addition to this, the\nparameter values required for coexistence in the simu-\nlations for our colonisation model are much more real-\nistic than for our competition model simulations, and\nare compatible with experimental data (Whitmore and\nBrown, 1996). We are able to use very similar parame-\nter values for each species, such as might be expected\nfor climax rain forest tree species, and can simulate\ncoexistence over large timescales.\n5.5. Comparison between two-species exploitative\nand pre-emptive competition models with fruiting\nevents\nThe numerical results shown above in Figs. 5 and\n8 only include single parameter sets. Next, we investi-\ngate the parameter space (\u03b31, \u03b32), which is shown with\nregions of stability and feasibility for the exploitative\ncompetition model without fruiting events in Fig. 1.\nNow that the colonisation rates are a function of time,\nci(t) = \u03b1i exp(\u2212\u03b2it), there are four parameters asso-\nciated with the colonisation rates for two species in\naddition to the mortality rate, m. We fix the \u03b2i and m to\nreduce the parameter space we need to investigate, this\nalso may allow us a better comparison with Fig. 1 which\nis in (\u03b31, \u03b32) space.

Dynamics of competition between species, for our colonisation model (30)\u2013(33). The parameter values are given in Table E.2 (mi, \u03b1i\nand \u03b2i, Appendix E). In all cases (2, 6 and 180 species), there is a balance between proliferation and death which enables all species to persist\nover 1000 years, while using realistic parameter values. After 104 years, 5 species persist in the 6-species model and 26 species persist in the\n180-species model. However, after 105 years, 2 species persist in the 6-species case, with 6 species persisting in the 180-species case. Note the\nlogarithmic scale on the horizontal (time) axis.\nspecies in each area of the parameter space are shown\n(black = 1, white = 0), along with regions in the pa-\nrameter space that lead to coexistence. Unfortunately,\nthe parameter region for unstable coexistence (Fig. 1,\nregion 1) in the exploitative competition model does\nnot neatly correspond to that observed when fruiting\nevents are incorporated into the model. Additionally,\nthe area of coexistence in the parameter space in the\npre-emptive model does not lie along the line of neutral\nstability of the coexistence in the deterministic model.\nThis could be due to the fact that the average value of\nthe colonisation rates, ci, are not exactly the correct\nvalue to use in the comparison with the deterministic\nmodels. But what is apparent is that the region of co-\nexistence is greater for pre-emptive over exploitative\ncompetition.\nObviously, we have only presented results from\na limited region of the entire parameter space\n(\u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22,m1,m2), but these results are indicative\nof the general results. That is coexistence is possible for\na wider range of parameters in the pre-emptive model\nas compared to the exploitative competition model.\n5.6. Timescale for decay\nComparing Fig. 4 with Fig. 7, we observe that the\ntimescale for decay in the exploitative competition\nmodel is much less than that for the pre-emptive compe-\ntition model. In order to quantify the length of the phase\nof species decline within both of the above models (Eqs.\n(13) and (17)), we approximate the decay as being ex-\nponential and calculate the half-life timescale from the\neigenvalues for each system. Details of the calculation\nare given in Appendix C. We calculate the approximate\ntime taken for all non-dominant species to decay to 1%\nof their initial proportion and (in the case of 6 and 180\nspecies) the time for 50% of all species to decay to\n1% of their initial values.

For our competition model with two\nspecies, our calculated time to decay is 210 years and\nfor six species it is 250 years. For 180 species dynam-\nics, the model predicts 350 years for 50% of the species\nto decay, and 400 years for one to dominate. These val-\nues correspond well to values observed in Fig. 4. The\ncalculated timescale for dominance for our colonisa-\ntion model is 400 years for 2 species, 1.1 \u00d7 104 years\nfor 6 species and 3.7 \u00d7 105 years for 180 species. How-\never, the timescale for half of the species to decay is\n1000 years for 6 species and 2200 years for 180 species\n(Fig. 7). Simulated timescales from our numerical ex-\nperiments are close to these values, however, they are\nnot exact due to the assumption that all species decay\nexponentially. There are more complex nonlinear com-\npetitive interactions between the species which may\naffect the timescale for dominance. This strengthens\nthe case that the pre-emptive model is a more realis-\ntic description of competition. This form of competi-\ntive interaction slows down the rate of extinction, when\ncoupled with temporal variability (fruiting events) they\nare sufficient to allow long-term persistence of species\nin an unstable equilibrium.\n5.6.1. Variability of random results\nThe results presented in the graphs with fruiting\nevents (Figs. 5 and 8) are subject to some variation due\nto the fact that the interval between events is randomly\ndetermined at each step. In the case of the exploitative\ncompetition model, different competitors come to dom-\ninate on different occasions largely due to chance. In\nC.J.

It is clear that\nour colonisation model has much lower variability than\nour exploitative competition model, providing another\nreason to reassess the role of exploitative competition\nin tropical rain forests.\n5.6.2. Periodic fruiting events\nIn order to assess the effect of the different compo-\nnents of our model, we conducted some more numeri-\ncal experiments. Firstly, we considered the colonisation\nrates of the species. If we remove fruiting events from\nthe model and compare constant and decaying coloni-\nsation rates for our competition and colonisation mod-\nels, then we find that with only decaying colonisation\nrates, all the species die out. This is because the contri-\nbution from mortality overcomes the contribution from\ncolonisation.\nWe have incorporated fruiting events into our mod-\nels as an example of a disturbance event. The frequency\nof the events is periodic with a random time component\ndetermined by a random number generator in our sim-\nulations. We carried out further numerical experiments\nin order to determine whether temporal heterogene-\nity is a sufficient factor to reproduce long-term coex-\nistence, or if randomness is required as well. When\nwe considered strictly periodic disturbance events, we\nfound that while the length of time to competitive exclu-\nsion is greater than in a model with no fruiting events,\n270 C.J.

Bampfylde et al. \/ Ecological Modelling 188 (2005) 253\u2013278 271\ncompetitive exclusion is not prevented (compare Fig.\n4 with Fig. 12 and Fig. 7 with Fig. 13). Our simula-\ntions also demonstrate that if a fixed period between\nfruiting events is taken, one species always goes on\nto dominate the others (there is no variability between\nsimulations). The particular species that dominates in\neach case depends on the period of the fruiting event in-\nterval. We would expect this to be the case as different\nspecies benefit from a particular period. We conclude\nthat randomness in addition to temporal heterogeneity\nis required for long-term species coexistence. Some ex-\nample results are shown in Fig. 12 (competition model)\nand Fig. 13 (colonisation model).\nIt is interesting to note that as the length of the in-\nterval between events increases, progressively lower\nranked species in the competitive hierarchy dominate,\nuntil a threshold is reached (tf \u2248 10 for the colonisa-\ntion model and tf \u2248 60 for the competition model) and\nthen species 1 dominates again. In each case once the\ninterval between events is long enough, species 1 will\ndominate because the simulation proceeds as if there\nare no fruiting events. This is consistent with the results\nobserved in Fig. 4 in the absence of fruiting events. Sub-\nsequent resetting of conditions does not alter the dom-\ninance of species 1. Obviously, if the interval between\nfruiting events is greater than the average lifespan of\nan individual then even species 1 will become extinct.\n6. Discussion and conclusions\nTwo new models for the dynamics of rain forest tree\nspecies have been proposed in this paper. The first in-\ncorporates a more realistic description of the process of\ncompetition between tropical rain forest tree seedlings\nthan is embodied by Tilman\u2019s (1994) model. The de-\nterministic model incorporates competition in the form\nof both exploitative and pre-emptive competition. In\ngeneral, neither form of competition in the determin-\nistic model leads to multiple species coexistence. One\nspecies ultimately excludes all others from colonising\ngaps.\nHowever, linear stability analysis shows that there\nis bistability within certain parameter regimes. This\nF colonis\n(ig. 13.

Bampfylde et al. \/ Ecological Modelling 188 (2005) 253\u2013278\nmeans that there are two stable steady states with each\nspecies excluding the other in each one. The species\nthat dominates the landscape is partially determined\nby the initial conditions of the system. If we imag-\nine the spatial structure of the landscape as a patch-\nwork, with different patches tending towards different\nspecies dominating in each patch, then we could envis-\nage that immigration between patches (due to disper-\nsal) might stop any species from going extinct in each\npatch. This mechanism has been invoked in Bell\u2019s neu-\ntral theory (2000) and in other patch models (Yu and\nWilson, 2001). In practice this may lead to landscape\nlevel coexistence even if patch level coexistence is not\nmaintained. In order to investigate such a possibility,\ndispersal rates would need to be measured and anal-\nysed. However, spatial segregation of species on the\nlandscape has been criticised as to whether it can be\ndefined as coexistence (Murrell and Law, 2003).\nWe conclude from the results for the two models\ndescribed above that an additional factor needs to be\nincorporated in order to simulate the observed lev-\nels of species coexistence. We have included mast-\nfruiting events, which are characteristic of Southeast\nAsian rain forests, occurring with a random frequency\nof between 3 and 11 years, triggered by the ENSO\n(Sakai et al., 1999; Yasuda et al., 1999). The seedling\nbank of each species decays over time between fruiting\nevents so we changed the colonisation rates (constant\nuntil this point) to decay over time at a different rate\nfor each species. The consequence of this is to allow\ne\nv\nr\ns\nl\nm\nh\ni\nt\nn\nw\nm\nc\nt\na\ni\na\nsufficient number of adults survive the unfavourable\nconditions.\nMast-fruiting events have been introduced in both\nmodels (with exploitative and pre-emptive competi-\ntion). Numerical simulation is used to generate the re-\nsults, as mathematical analysis is difficult on such a\ncomplex system. Numerically, we observe that both\nmodels can exhibit coexisting species over some\ntimescales. This effect is strongest in the stochastic\nmodel with pre-emptive competition (large numbers\nof species persist after 105 years in Fig. 8). In order\nto achieve coexistence, in particular in the two-species\ncase, we are forced to use unrealistic parameter values\nin the model with exploitative competition. Due to the\necological similarities between many climax rain for-\nest tree species, on biological grounds we prefer the\ncolonisation model. Additionally, a more thorough in-\nvestigation of the parameter space (Fig. 10) leads us to\nthe conclusion that coexistence is also possible over a\nwider range of circumstances (parameter sets) in the\nstochastic model with pre-emptive competition over\nthe model with exploitative competition.\nThe random time component in the frequency of\nthe mast-fruiting events is essential for stability. Pe-\nriodic fruiting events were shown to result in sin-\ngle species dominance. The periodicity prevents some\nspecies from making use of their golden period. We\nbelieve that the random mast-fruiting events are an ex-\nample of a time-varying nonlinearity that is often in-\nvoked as promoting species coexistence (Levins, 1979;\nH\nt\nf\nc\n2\nt\ni\nt\nr\nc\nb\nm\ns\nt\nr\nf\npach species to have a golden period during the inter-\nal between mast-fruiting events when it has the highest\nelative colonisation rate. This is a consequence of the\ntrict trade-off between species producing many short-\nived seedlings or few long-lived seedlings.\nKubo and Iwasa (1996) have previously proposed a\nodel which allows for species coexistence if species\nave a different peak in their regeneration ability dur-\nng the growing season. The phenological niche of\nhe species also varies, those with non-overlapping\niches are able to persist in their model framework,\nhile those with broad overlapping niches do not. Their\nodel is applicable in environments where annual syn-\nhronous recruitment takes place. However, in our sys-\nem, this is not a valid assumption. The random supra-\nnnual intervals between subsequent fruiting events\nn our system allows for each species to encounter\nfavourable episode, subject to the condition that auston, 1979; Doyle, 1981). Other models, in response\no Tilman\u2019s (1994) model invoke spatial structure in the\norm of variable density patches which enable species\noexistence on the landscape scale (Yu and Wilson,\n001). We have demonstrated that a simpler alterna-\nive formulation, using endogenous temporal variabil-\nty also allows coexistence.\nUntil now, many studies in the literature have ei-\nher been empirically based and developed many ideas\negarding community processes, or purely theoretical\nonstructs (for example, the heteromyopia proposed\ny Murrell and Law (2003)). We used mathematical\nodelling as a tool to understand the maintenance of\npecies diversity in the tropical rain forest. The aim of\nhis study is not to develop more theory, but to incorpo-\nate knowledge gained empirically into the modelling\nramework.

There are already many simulation mod-\nels designed to incorporate all possible factors and in-\nteractions, for example, the FORMIX3 model by Huth\nand Ditzer (2000) and TROLL model by Chave (1999).\nConversely, the models proposed here are unique such\nthat they express the most parsimonious representation\nof the relevant biological phenomena. The modelling\nframework allowed us to add or remove components\nand allowed us to disentangle the effects of specific\nfeatures of the model.\nThe models presented in this paper incorporate sev-\neral simplifying assumptions. This is an important gen-\neral criticism made by experimentalists of modellers\n(Peters, 1991). It is important to assess whether relax-\ning some of the assumptions will yield more realistic\nresults in terms of species coexistence and the mainte-\nnance of diversity in tropical rain forests. The model\nframework used so far has only taken into account adult\ntrees. The colonisation rates used in our models assume\nan instantaneous change from juvenile to adult, while\nthe success of an individual in a gap is likely to be a\nfunction of the presence of juveniles of other species,\nrather than the adults. The dynamics of seedling and\nsapling populations are no doubt important (Whitmore\nand Brown, 1996) in the forest structure and a stage-\nstructured model would investigate these. In future, we\nhope to examine the impact on species coexistence via\nthe mechanism of juvenile dynamics and adult dynam-\nics operating over different temporal scales. The model\nframework we have developed allows for additional\nd\ne\ns\n(\nt\nof one species by another is unlikely. It also suggests\nthat time-varying nonlinearities are important in such\nsystems.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are pleased to acknowledge the financial\nsupport of the following organisations: a studentship\nfrom EPSRC and from NERC for CJB; a Career Devel-\nopment Fellowship from the Medical Research Coun-\ncil for DJG; which has allowed them to undertake this\nresearch.
