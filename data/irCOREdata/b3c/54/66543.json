Contra Descartes, science is not some method \nor capacity through which we are able to achieve existential externality in order to \ndiscover eternal truths. For Bergson the game that science plays in the cosmos is all \nabout time \u2013 or in his own terms \u2018duration\u2019. He states: \u2018The universe endures. \u2026 The \nsystems marked off by science endure only because they are bound up inseparably \nwith the rest of the universe\u2019.i That is to say that the endurance of science is \nprovisional. Its endurance is marked by the universe it describes. This temporal \ndimension also introduces the possibility for variation and evolution.  \n \nPerhaps this is a statement about Science, rather than about science \u2013 a statement that \nis too all encompassing. We will leave such thoughts for somebody else, for here we \nare interested in science. We are interested in the specific interventions that particular \nscientists make, and are making, into the material world within the broadly defined \nfield of nanotechnology. Indeed, it is at this level of specificity that the notion of \nendurance comes into its own. For nanotechnology, which is both scientific and \ntechnical (if we must bring up that old distinction), is fundamentally about making \nthings. That is, nanotechnology is about the construction, generation and growth of \nobjects, devices and architecture \u2013 all of which have a certain endurance. In working \nat the nanoscale (10-9m), in the world of Brownian motion and atomic uncertainty, \nthis kind of endurance is produced by certain forms of control \u2013 specifically the \ncontrol of sub-molecular particles, of biological systems, chemical syntheses, \nreactions and crystal growth. If it is possible to construct a nanostructure from a few \natoms or molecules, or to grow one using a protein or some process of crystallisation, \nthe endurance of this structure is dependent on being able to control atomic-level \nforces that would tear it apart. Such endurance is premised on perpetual control.  \n \nOf course Deleuze was also famously interested in control, particularly in his \n\u2018Postscript for Control Societies\u2019. For Deleuze \u2018control\u2019 defines the political \n 2\nconstitution of the contemporary moment. Critical of Foucault\u2019s analysis of modern \ndiscipline, he suggests that institutions and technologies of incarceration and \ndiscipline are being replaced by the mechanisms of control. He states: \u2018We\u2019re in the \nmidst of a general breakdown of all sites of confinement\u2014prisons, hospitals, \nfactories, schools, the family \u2026 Control societies are taking over from disciplinary \nsocieties\u2019. For Deleuze this regime of control is not about any specific mechanism, \ntechnology or institution of control. Indeed he states: \n \nIt\u2019s not a question of amazing pharmaceutical products, nuclear technology, \nand genetic engineering, even though these play a part in the process. It\u2019s not a \nquestion of asking whether the old of new system is hasher or more bearable, \nbecause there\u2019s a conflict in each between the ways they free and enslave us. \nWith the breakdown of the hospital as a site of confinement, for instance, \ncommunity psychiatry, day hospitals, and home care initially presented new \nfreedoms, while at the same time contributing to mechanisms of control as \nrigorous as the harshest confinement. ii\n \nThis then is one side of control \u2013 the side of power and determinism. This is the \npower of total control and it is the dream of many nanotechnologists. This is the kind \nof control through which some suggest that it will be possible to \u2018build anything we \nwant\u2019 simply by arranging atoms the way we would like themiii. However, for \nDeleuze, control is never absolute in this sense. Control is a product of a repetition of \nforce. Therefore in the application of force and control we also see the radical \npossibility for creativity, lines of flight and the nomad. As such Deleuze is more \ninterested in modes of control and modes of perpetuating coherence than in absolute \ncontrol per se.  \n \nDeleuze\u2019s \u2018philosophy of technology\u2019 is both open and dynamic.  He adopts an open \nstance in relation to science and technology. For Deleuze the link between \u2018basic\u2019 \nscientific knowledge and technical systems \u2013 which is mediated through the \ndisciplines of engineering, design, predictability and control \u2013 is neither simple or \nnecessary. For example, Deleuze\u2019s critique of the hylomorphic schema instead \nsuggests that control and predictability emerge almost spontaneously. As such, and \nfollowing Simondon and von Uexk\u00fcll, technical objects for Deleuze are ontologically \nunstable, produced through processes of individuation and self-organisation in \ncomplex relations with their milieuiv.  \n 3\n What is significant here is not the scientism of Deleuze\u2019s own thought, but rather the \nstance that Deleuzian thought enables one to take in relation to the emergence of \ntechnical objects and systems. Recent scholarship on the use of scientific concepts in \nDeleuzian thought has tended to be polarised between realist and metaphorical \ninterpretations of Deleuzian thought \u2013 that defend the use of mathematics and physics \nin Deleuzian thought as either scientifically valid or allegorically salient.v Both of \nthese positions interpret the use of science by Deleuze in solely conceptual terms \u2013 as \nif what is at stake is either the metaphysical rigour of his use of science or its \nmetaphorical resonance. However, this choice between realism and idealism is a false \none.  Both misunderstand science itself in wholly conceptual terms without any sense \nof the interconnected material practices and interventions fundamentally intertwined \nwith the emergence of technical objects and systems.vi Deleuze\u2019s use of science is \nmuch more political than philosophical, and much more attuned to the mechanisms of \ninvention and creation to be simply cast as conceptual intellectual folly.  \n \nWhat is at stake in Deleuze is not Science, or even Philosophy . This is particularly \nthe case in Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s almost \u2018disrespectful\u2019 treatment of the pillars of \nScience, Art and Philosophy in What is Philosophy in which they state: \n \nThe three disciplines (art, science and philosophy) advance by crises or shocks \nin different way and in each case it is their succession that makes it possible to \nspeak of \u2018progress\u2019. It is as if the struggle against chaos does not take place \nwithout an affinity with the enemy, because another struggle develops and \ntakes on more importance \u2013 the struggle against opinion, which claims to \nprotect us from chaos itself. vii\n \nDeleuze and Guattari\u2019s interpretation of science is fundamentally material. The \n\u2018affinity with the enemy\u2019 is the same relation that the artisan makes with the wood, or \nthe blacksmith makes with the metal outlined in A Thousand Plateaus. In this sense, \nDeleuze refuses the Cartesian definition of science as simply conceptual invention. \nRather for Deleuze conceptual science is one expression of this material \u2018affinity with \nthe enemy\u2019 on the same lineage as alchemy, woodwork and blacksmithery. To this \nend, in what follows I will outline Deleuze\u2019s stance in relation to invention, creation \nand technology \u2013 suggesting that, in place of the reductionism of \u2018total\u2019 control, \n 4\nDeleuze\u2019s ethic aims to vitalise technology. Deleuze aims to open up and potentialise \nscience and technology to the internal evolution of matter \u2018all the way down\u2019.  \n. \nNanotechnologies \nThe prefix nano, from the Greek nanos meaning small, gives an immediate indication \nof the kinds of interventions in the material word envisioned by this word\u2014small \nones. A nanometre being 10-9m, nanotechnology is technology on the atomic and \nsubmolecular scale.  \n \nNanotechnology encompasses work of advanced nano-scale science, particularly the \nincreased understandings of atomic-scale interactions and the capacity to visualise (or \nmore correctly to characterise) and control materials at sub-micron levels using the \nscanning tunnelling microscope. However, as suggested by the suffix\u2014technology\u2014\nnanotechnology is also a term that designates new forms of practice at nano-metre \nscale.   \n \nThe canonical story of the origin of nanotechnology is familiar and oft told. The \nNobel Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman\u2019s now famous lecture, \u2018There is \nplenty of room at the bottom\u2019 is commonly regarded as the first public musings by a \nscientist about the possibilities of technology on the nano-scale.viii He wondered \n\u2018Why cannot we write the entire twenty-four volumes of the Encyclopaedia \nBritannica on the head of a pin?\u2019. His notion that there is no physical barrier to the \nextreme miniaturisation of technology operates as a central motivating discourse \naround which nanotechnology operates. Indeed in subsequent controversies around \nwhat counts as \u2018fact\u2019 and \u2018fancy\u2019 proponents have often claim that they are simply \nexpressing the implications of Feynman\u2019s original vision.ix  For example, Eric \nDrexler\u2019s now (in)famous nanotechnology manifesto: Engines of Creation: The \nComing Age of Nanotechnology, in which he outlines a Feynman-ian notion of the \nsheer physical possibility of molecular nanotechnology technology as an alternative to \nmodern \u2018bulk technology\u2019: \n \nCoal and diamonds, sand and computer chips, cancer and healthy tissue: \nthroughout history, variations in the arrangement of atoms have distinguished \nthe cheap from the cherished, the diseased from the healthy. Arranged one \nway, atoms make up soil, air, and water; arranged another, they make up ripe \n 5\nstrawberries. Arranged one way, they make up homes and fresh air; arranges \nanother, they make up ash and smoke.x\n \nFor Drexler nanotechnology represents a mode through which life may be understood \nphysically. Drexler\u2019s manifesto mirrors Feynman\u2019s vision: that there is no physical \nbarrier, or practical reason why current technology \u2013 medicine, information \ntechnology and engineering \u2013 cannot operate with precision at the nano-scale.  \n \nNanotechnology is fundamentally technological, it is about technique, process, and \nprecision. Drexler\u2019s manifesto, which self-consciously mirrors science fiction in \ndeveloping possible future nanotechnology scenarios, does not break new ground in \nterms of scientific knowledge regarding the atom. Rather it is the preparatory \nexploration, outlining the possible implications of the convergence of abstract atomic \nknowledge with increased technical ability at these scales.  \n \nNanotechnology and reductionist returnsxi\nThe reductionism implicit in contemporary genetic technologiesxii is both extended \nand intensified in Drexler\u2019s account of nanotechnology.xiii For Drexler all things, both \norganic and inorganic, are simply a collection of atoms and molecules. In this sense \nDrexler\u2019s determinism is fundamentally physicalist. Whereas for genetic determinism \nit is assumed that life forms are determined by the process of heredity, for Drexler life \nitself is determined simply by its physical constitution. In this sense, life itself is \nabsolutely divisible, and therefore manipulable. The only difference between material \nobjects is the alternative arrangements that such atoms take. Indeed, the radical \npossibility that Drexler presents is that, when control over the structure of matter is \nachieved, it will be possible to make \u2018almost anything\u2019 from the \u2018bottom-up\u2019.xiv  \n \nThe root of this physicalist determinism is Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s essay What is Life? The \nPhysical Aspect of the Living Cell. In this essay Schr\u00f6dinger outlines a physicalist \nunderstanding of life and matter upon which the dreams of an unlimited material \nabundance, produced by nanotechnology, are based. Indeed he initiates a \u2018materialist \nturn\u2019 in biology by suggesting that biological processes may be explained physically. \nSchr\u00f6dinger asks: \n \n 6\nHow can events in space and time which take place within the spatial \nboundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry? \n \nTo which he gave the following answer: \n \nThe most essential part of a living cell \u2013 the chromosome fibre \u2013may suitably \nbe called an a periodic crystal. xv\n \nSchr\u00f6dinger signals the fundamental idea that living cells are physical \u2013 that they are \ncomposed by physical elements, atoms and aperiodic crystals \u2013 and as such can be \nconceptualised in physics and chemistry as well as biology. The notion, articulated by \nproponents of nanotechnology, that such technology maybe able to cure diseases, \nremedy pollution and create clean energy, relies on this most basic premise of the \natomic physicality of \u2018life\u2019. Therefore Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s physicalism is paradoxical in \nthat it also heralds a reductionist notion of the absolute divisibility of all life. In this \nsense the physical itself becomes nothing less than an instrumental concern in the \ntechnologisation of life and nature.xvi  \n \nThere is a rich double meaning to Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s essay What is Life? His notion of \nmatter and of life is irreducibly vitalistic. He is interested in life \u2013 in the physics of \nlife. In one sense this life is about the physicality of life, its material and atomic bases, \nyet in another it is about a certain physical life or liveliness of matter. Schr\u00f6dinger \nintroduces a notion of the vital life of the atomic. Schr\u00f6dinger captures the movement, \nvariation and digression of the material at atomic and molecular scales. Crandall \nembraces Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s move in his vision of nanotechnology: \n \nThis bumbling, stumbling dance allows molecules all possible \u2018mating \nconfigurations with the other molecules in their local environment. By \nvariously constraining and controlling the chaos of such wild interactions, \nbiological systems generate the event we call life.xvii\n \nFor Crandall the promise of nanotechnology is of a technology of \u2018molecular \nconstruction\u2019, the miniaturisation of macro-scale manufacturing techniques enabling \nthe precise placement construction of objects atom by atom. Similar Drexler\u2019s vision \nis of nano-scale replicators \u2013 autonomous, self-replicating machines will enable such \ntechniques of atomic precision to be infinitely multiplied. Building upon \n 7\nenhancements in the characterisation of atomic structures and the precision with \nwhich these structures may be controlled, Crandall positions nanotechnology as the \nability to create nano-scale machines and to construct material objects from the \nbottom up, through the precise alignment of sub-molecular materials.  \n \nFor both Crandall and Drexler the simple fact that biological life is accomplished \nthrough the selective control over the movement of atoms and molecules \ndemonstrates the possibility of similar human designed processes. Their ontology of \nthe atomic, though emphasising the internal movement, variation and flux, operates \nonly as the technical limit upon what is possible. For Drexler and Crandall the \ntechnical limits of nanotechnology are \u2018set\u2019 by the nature and being of atomic scale \nmatter (its ontological status). At the core of the Drexlerian vision, as expressed by \nCrandall, is a notion of control. If the \u2018event we call life\u2019 is generated by the \u2018wild \ninteractions\u2019 of particles at the nanoscale, the broad goal of fundamental nanoscale \nresearch must be toward achieving control over these interactions so that they may be \ndirected in desired ways. As such, the Drexlarian vision of the possibilities for self-\nreplicating nano-scale robots has become a programmatic definition of \nnanotechnology as the \u2018total (or near total) control over the structure of matter\u2019.xviii  \n \nThe mechanistic reductionism of nanotechnology also has its roots in a logic of what \nmight be properly termed a \u2018biological turn\u2019 in theoretical physics and mathematics. \nThis \u2018biological turn\u2019 may be identified in the move toward the mathematical \nmodelling of complex and naturally occurring phenomena \u2013 particularly in swarm and \ngame theory. Of particular significance in the development of nanoscience and \nnanotechnology is von Neumann\u2019s mathematical modelling of self-reproducing \nsystems. Von Neumann\u2019s theory of automata \u2013 modelled on the functionality of the \nneuron \u2013 is an expression of the sheer algorithmic possibility of computationally \nrecreating naturally occurring self-reproducing systems. His is a vision of what is \n\u2018logically possible\u2019 as he states: \n \n A new, essentially logical, theory is called for in order to understand high-\n complication automata and in particular the central nervous system.xix\n \n 8\nAs such, von Neumann\u2019s thesis suggests that naturally occurring self-replicating \nsystems may be modelled mathematically. For von Neumann, the key to the \nmathematical recreation of cellular automata is the inherent logic imbedded within the \nvery complexity of such systems \u2013 what he terms \u2018complication\u2019. At a high degree of \ncomplication \u2013 or complexity \u2013 are able self organise themselves. The key therefore is \nto discover the mathematical logic and laws through which systems of such high \ncomplexity operate: \n  \nAll these are very crude steps in the direction of a systematic theory of \nautomata. They represent, in addition, only one particular direction. This is, as \nI indicated before, the direction towards forming a rigorous concept of what \nconstitutes \u2018complication\u2019 (or complexity). They illustrate that \u2018complication\u2019 \non its lower levels is probably degenerative, that is, that every automaton that \ncan produce over automata will only be able to produce less complicated ones. \nThere is however. A certain minimum level where this degenerative \ncharacteristic ceases to be universal. At this point automata which can \nreproduce themselves, or even construct higher entities, become possible. xx\n \nFor von Neumann \u2018self-reproduction, evolution \u2013 life in brief \u2013 can be achieved \nwithin a cellular automaton \u2013 a toy world governed by simple discrete rules not unlike \nthose of a solitaire game\u2019.xxi Von Neumann\u2019s search was for the laws that governed \nthe formation and functioning of cellular automata. His logical route is from the big to \nthe small, from the complexity of self-organisation to simple, discrete laws. Von \nNeumann offers a bio-mimetic logic where existing biological systems may be \nmodelled through such laws and the precise control of the parameters of such systems. \nAs such von Neumann\u2019s notion of the algorithmic recreation of complex systems \nmasks an extreme reductionism in which simple laws control complex systems.xxii\n \nThe importance of Von Neumann\u2019s work in nanoscience and nanotechnology is two-\nfold. Firstly, his basic thesis is that self-replicating automata are logically possible \ncasts matter and the material as simple instrumental concerns. For von Neumann \u2013 \nand also for Dexler \u2013 if self-replicating automata are logically possible they must also, \nby necessity, be physically possible. Secondly, the combined effect of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s \nphysical understanding of life and von Neumann\u2019s logic of the self-replicating \nautomata is to suggest that chemical and biological processes may be understood \nfunctionally as code or information. Von Neumann suggests that natural occurring \nautomata conform to algorithmic logic and that they may be technically recreated by \n 9\nmanipulating the parameters of algorithms. This reductionism offers the possibility of \ntotal control of such biological and chemical systems. In this way biological systems \nbecome a set of mathematical and computational instructions that may be \ntechnologically re-ordered. Lehn echoes this understanding of biological and chemical \nprocesses by suggesting that forms of \u2018living\u2019 or \u2018complex\u2019 matter may be created by \ncontrolling the informational exchange at the heart of chemistry and biology. In what \nhe terms \u2018supramolecular\u2019 chemistry he suggests: \n \nSupramolecular chemistry has paved the way toward apprehending chemistry \nas an information science through the implementation of the concept of \nmolecular information with the aim of gaining progressive control over the \nspatial (structural) and temporal (dynamic) features of matter and over its \ncomplexification through self-organisation, the drive to life. xxiii\n \nBoth the \u2018materialist turn\u2019 in biology and the \u2018biological turn\u2019 in mathematics and \nphysics are concerned with a set of logical possibilities. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s conception of \nthe physics of life and von Neumann\u2019s mathematical theory of automata have the \neffect of converting life itself into discrete physical entities which operate as a form of \ninformation or code. This double move has the paradoxical effect of rendering the \nphysicality of biological and chemical systems as merely an instrumental concern in \nthe hylomorphic application of computational models onto material substrates. \nCombined with Feynman\u2019s vision of atomic scale machinery nanotechnology operates \nas a set of theoretical promises and possibilities for gaining \u2018progressive control\u2019 over \nthe structure of matter in the design and manufacture of nanotechnologies. Life itself \nis cast as absolutely divisible. The mechanisms of reproduction and self-organisation \nare themselves recreatable, given the precise control over the parameters of chemical \nsynthesis of biological systems.  \n \nThis rhetorical move from the big to the small, from the complex to the simple and \nfrom the chaotic to the organised parallels the overall imagination of nanotechnology \nas the ability to precisely control the ultimate building blocks of life. This logic is also \ncomparable to the reductionism at the heart of some versions of complexity theory. \nBroadly speaking whereas chaos theory works in the reverse direction \u2013 small events \nproducing large results \u2013 complexity theory suggests that simple structures emerge \nand self-organise in the context of complex and dynamic systems.xxiv Though inherent \n 10\nto theoretical accounts of complexity theory is the spontaneous emergence of \norganised structures, its technological operationalisation often reveals a reductionist \ndrive toward simplification and predictive control.xxv It is in the construction of \ncomplexity theory as a unifying project, through which total systems understanding, \nsimplification and predictive control may be achieved, that complexity theory is at its \nmost reductionist. For example, Capra defines complexity theory as:  \n \nA new mathematical language and a new set of concepts for describing and \nmodelling complex nonlinear systems. Complexity theory now offers the \nexciting possibility of developing a unified view of life by integrating life\u2019s \nbiological cognitive and social dimension\u2019 (emphasis added). xxvi  \n \nBy unifying biological, chemical and physical knowledge, complexity theory, is \nthought to enable an enhanced capacity to model non-linear systems. By extension \ncomplexity theory is seen to enable the precise control and recreation of such \nsystems.xxvii The rhetorical move from the complex, the large, and the extensive to the \nsimple, the small and the intensive is ambiguously reductionist. Given this ambiguity \ncomplexity theory masks a \u2018reductionist return\u2019xxviii in contemporary technoscience \ninherent that is revealed in the currency of notions such as predictive control, \nmodelling, law and total systems knowledge.  \n \nThis reductionism mirrors the rhetorical efforts of miniaturisation and simplification \nmade by Feynman, Schr\u00f6dinger and von Neumann. The combined effect of Feynman, \nSchr\u00f6dinger and von Neumann is to cast biological, chemical and material \u2018life\u2019 as \nabsolutely physically divisible and created through mechanisms that are ultimately \ncontrollable. Indeed, nanotechnology operates as a similar \u2018unifying\u2019 project as \ncomplexity theory \u2013 combining traditional scientific disciplines of physics, chemistry, \nmathematics and biology with technically oriented disciplines of engineering and \ncomputing. Rhetorically nanotechnology also relies upon a similar rhetorical move \nfrom the big to the small as the ultimate technical expression of the miniaturisation \nimperative. Thus for Drexler, following Feynman, Schr\u00f6dinger and von Neumann, the \nsheer logical possibility of nanoscale engineering and manufacture is established \nabsolute divisibility of all forms of life and materiality to the atom and the technical \npossibilities for building things \u2018atom by atom\u2019.  \n \n 11\nUnity vs. singularity \nThe reductionism of advanced nanotechnology is also deeply political. The vision of \nnanotechnology as heralding the ability to remake the world \u2018atom by atom\u2019, and as \nleading to the \u2018next industrial revolution\u2019, is also a State sanctioned vision of the \npower of science to revolutionise material practice. xxix The reductionism of \nnanotechnology, that demands total control of the atomic scale, is deeply entwined \nwith this politics. This is what Deleuze calls the politics of the State, or the \u2018apparatus \nof capture\u2019, in which the unifying project of reductionist science works toward the \ntotal control demanded by the State.  \n \nDeleuze\u2019s ontology is of an entirely different order. Deleuze neither moves from the \ncomplex to the simple, nor from the simple to the chaotic. Rather Deleuze starts with \nthe singular or \u2013 more properly \u2013 the singularity. Whilst in nanotechnology the unity \nrepresents the absolute divisibility of life Deleuze starts with the notion of the \nsingularity as the basis for molecular variation and flux. Deleuze\u2019s \u2018philosophy of \ndifference\u2019 fundamentally concerned with revalorising the singular, over and above \nthe particular. He deploys an explicitly monistic ontology\u2014a material pantheism \nwhereby the singularity of matter is alive with the creative potential of endless \nevolutions and innovations. Delueze states:   \n \nThere has only ever been one ontological proposition: Being is univocal. \nThere are not two \u2018paths\u2019, as Parmenides\u2019 poem suggests, but a single \u2018voice\u2019 \nof Being which includes all its modes, including the most diverse, the most \nvaried, the most differentiated. Being is said in a single and same sense of \neverything of which it is said, but that of which it is said differs: it is said of \ndifference itself.xxx\n \nWhat Deleuze does here is to free \u2018the singular\u2019 from \u2018the particular\u2019, giving it an \nindividuating capacity. Deleuze\u2019s notion of singularity is at once an absolute rebuttal \nof both the Platonic and Aristotelian metaphysics of matter and a valorisation of the \ncreative vitalism of the material. He refuses the categorical difference, established by \nthe metaphysicians, between matter and form or between the subject and the object. \nRather, all things are formed through repetitious individuation of the same \nsubstance\u2014the monadic singularity\u2014intensities, riffs, sublimations in a singular key. \nRethinking monadology in explictly materialistic terms enables Deleuze to insist upon \na materialism that is \u2018roughly equivalent to an ongoing Big Bang, permanent \n 12\nCreation\u2019xxxi, precisely because whilst this evolution is both permanent and multiple, \nthe substance upon which these operations is performed is singular. Thus it is not \nsimply that \u2018matter is singular\u2019 as a universal substance. Rather matters are \nsingularities\u2014momentary agglomerations in the creative evolution of the singular, \nmonistic substance.  \n \nDue to his emphasis on a monistic creative evolution Deleuze\u2019s materialism is \ninherently spontaneous. For Deleuze monism is not simply about a reductionism to \nthe atomic, the whole, the plane or the easy to handle. Rather, in Deleuze\u2019s hands \nmonism is about the elevation of the singular\u2014the singular that is difference itself. \nDeleuze\u2019s philosophy of difference is singular precisely because it positions \ndifference as internal to the object, rather than between (categorically different) \nthings. Deleuze follows Simondon\u2019s drive to free individuation from any organising \nprinciple of the individual.xxxii Deleuze\u2019s aim is to compose a philosophy of \ndifference\u2014rather than of diversity\u2014in the singular, where what differs is not one \nthing from another, but the thing from itself. This repetition of the singular, what \nDeleuze calls the production of singularities, imbues within objects, things, \nsubstances and bodies a dynamic sense of action. For Deleuze this spontaneity goes \n\u2018all the way down\u2019 and is not computable by law or assumptions of predictability. It is \nby following Simondon that Deleuze enables a dynamic theory of technology on par \nwith the technical possibilities of nanoscience, in which the singular, the atomic and \nthe molecular are energised in the creative production of difference. Repetition, for \nDeleuze, is the essence of creativity or \u2013 in Bergson\u2019s terminology \u2013 creative \nevolution. It is this monistic ontology of singularity (rather than unity) that imbues \nmatter with a sense of unstable movement because the repetition of this monistic \nsubstance is not simply a matter of the production of equivalences, but repetition is \nthe production of difference, the movement and creative evolution of the thing: \n \nRepetition is a condition of action before it is a concept of reflection. We \nproduce something new only on condition that we repeat\u2014once in the mode \nwhich constitutes the past, and once more in the present of \nmetamorphosis.xxxiii\n \nThough Deleuze does not have what might be termed a \u2018philosophy of technology\u2019 \u2013 \nin the manner of Heidegger or even Derrida \u2013 one would imagine a Deleuzian stance \n 13\nor ethic toward technology that, following Simondon and von Uexk\u00fcll, allows for the \ncreative individuation of technology. Deleuze\u2019s stance toward technology is \nfundamentally a political engagement with powers of invention and creation. His \nbasic concern is to free individuation, and the singularity, from the unifying project of \n\u2018total control\u2019. Whereas in nanotechnology \u2013 as in other contemporary technologies \u2013 \nit is imagined that internal deviance, evolution and spontaneous self-organisation may \neither be mastered or technically harnessed, Deleuze imagines a technology that is \nradically open to evolution \u2018all the way down\u2019. Indeed, the problem for Deleuze with \nphilosophies of technology (either the sceptical, Heideggarian versions of technology \nas threatxxxiv or the more positive endorsements of the social-evolutionistsxxxv) is that \nthey treat technology as a distinct ontological category. Deleuze\u2019s philosophy is more \nan attitude or stance toward technologies that is open to the internal flux of \ntechnology, down to the molecular level.  \n \nThis stance toward technology imbues Deleuze\u2019s attitude towared the \u2018total control\u2019 \nimagined control societies. For Deleuze, control is not symptomatic, but rather \nemblematic. It does not emanate from a particular technology, or the \n\u2018technologisation\u2019 of all forms life itself, but is rather a kind of contemporary \nepistemic moment. The kind of control that Deleuze speaks of is the perpetual control \nof noise, variation and flux \u2013 the same modes of control over the internal \ndifferentiation of matter imagined in nanotechnology. However, this control is \nexpressed in specific modes of control. Because, for Deleuze, control is about the \nminute control of flux and variation, it is itself perpetually changing and never \ncomplete. For example, he states: \n \nControl is short-term and rapidly shifting, but at the same time continuous and \nunbounded (p. 181) \n \nNanotechnology and the Mastery of Evolution \nDrexler\u2019s vision of nanotechnology is inherently mechanical. He seeks to both control \nand harness the movement, variation and digression of matter at atomic and molecular \nscales. Drexler\u2019s vision is largely mechanistic \u2013 suggesting that nanotechnologies can \nbe produced through the hylomorphic imposition of an external design on material \nsubstrate, through the precise manipulation of matter \u2018atom-by-atom\u2019.xxxvi His basic \n 14\npremise, following Feynman, is that there is no physical impediment to conceiving \nmanufacturing technologies on the atomic scale. He represents this vision as a \nminiaturisation of existing mechanical techniques to the atomic scale. Indeed this \nmechanical bias of his thesis has been the source of a number of significant criticisms \n\u2013 primarily that the precise mechanical precision required is simply impossiblexxxvii. \nDespite the extensive criticism of Drexler, both his goal of \u2018bottom-up molecular \nproject\u2019 and the broad project of gaining \u2018control over the structure of matter\u2019 \nmaintain an important rhetoric in the field. In the extensive criticism of Drexler by \nRichard Smalley (2001; 2003a; 2003b) and latterly Richard Jones (2004), this notion \nof control is actually intensified. What is at issue for Smalley is whether the precise \ncontrol of atomic structures, necessitated by Drexler\u2019s vision of nano-scale \nmanufacture, is technically possible. \n \nDue in part to the repudiation of the vision of \u2018molecular manufacture\u2019, Drexler\u2019s \nradically mechanistic version of nanotechnology has been substituted by a more \nconservative and pragmatic set of nanoscale possibilitiesxxxviii. At issue is the sheer \nphysical possibility of autonomous nanoscale machines and the precision necessary to \n\u2018create\u2019 them. Recent scholarship has, however, revived the radical possibility of \nnanoscale machinic autonomy by rethinking the very way in which such machines \nmight be created. In this biomimetic model, such machines are grown using existing \nbiological systems as working examples.  \n \nIn the words of Bernadette Bensaude-Vincent there are \u2018two cultures of \nnanotechnology\u2019.xxxix Both present different understandings of the relationship \nbetween design and matter. One version of nanotechnology is implicitly mechanical. \nThe material world is completely atomised as simply an aggregate of particles. It is in \nthis sense that it is suggested that it will be possible to create anything \u00b4from the \nbottom-up\u2019 simply by arranging atoms and molecules in certain (desired) ways. \nAlternatively, Richard Jones imagines a different form of nano-scale control in which \ntechnical interventions harness rather than master the chaotic interactions at the \nnanoscale. He re-presents these same goals, but changes the route through which they \nwill be achieved. He suggests that nano-scale machines will be achieved through a \nmore bio-mimetic, or emulatory, nanotechnology which both takes its inspiration \nfrom, and actively utilises, existing biological systems.xl Rather than imagine \n 15\nnanotechnology as a set of mechanical interventions at the nanoscale, Jones presents a \nvision of nanotechnology that is modelled on naturally occurring biological systems. \nFor Jones naturally occurring \u2018molecular assemblages\u2019 such as protein and DNA \nrepresent a functional equivalent of self-assembling and self-organising molecular \nmachines. Jones\u2019 thesis is that biological systems present functioning models through \nwhich more purposeful nanotechnological interventions may be made. For Jones, \nbionanotechnology is a route through which applications at the nanoscale may be \nachieved. He states his basic vision as: \n \nMy own view is that radical nanotechnology will be developed, but not \nnecessarily along the path proposed by Drexler. I accept the force of the \nargument that biology gives us proof in principle that a radical \nnanotechnology, in which machines of molecular scale manipulate matter and \nenergy with great precision, can exist. But this argument also shows that there \nmay be more than one way of reaching the goal of radical nanotechnology, \nand that the path proposed by Drexler may not be the best one to follow. xli\n \nSignificantly for Jones, this necessitates a design process that is both open to, and able \nto harness, molecular evolution: \n \nEvolution needs some kind of selection pressure \u2013 some kind of way of \ndeciding which of the many random changes in the molecular sequence should \nsurvive and prosper. \u2026  We can devise experiments that drive molecules to \nevolve more complex properties \u2026xlii\n \n \nJones maintains that nanoscale machines are both technically possible and a desirable \nroute through which wide technical advances may be made, but suggests that the \ncurrent \u2018engineering approach\u2019 may well prove unrealistic. Instead he adopts a  \nbio-mimetic approach, suggesting that the creation of molecular machines, necessary \nto fulfil the radical vision of \u2018bottom up\u2019 manufacture\u2019, may be created by copying \nnature \u2013 that is emulating existing self-replicating systems such as protein and DNA. \nSimilarly, Seeman & Belcher outline this aim of \u2018emulating biology\u2019 by  \nre-creating self-assembling systems: \n \nA key property of biological nanostructures is molecular recognition, leading \nto self-assembly and the templating of atomic and molecular structures. For \nexample, it is well known that two complementary strands of DNA will pair to \nform a double helix. DNA illustrates two features of self-assembly. The \nmolecules have a strong affinity for each other and they form a predictable \nstructure when they associate. Those who wish to create defined \n 16\nnanostructures would like to develop systems that emulate this behaviour. \nThus, rather than milling down from the macroscopic level, using tools of \ngreater and greater precision (and probably cost), they would like to build \nnanoconstructs from the bottom up, starting with chemical systems.xliii\n \n \nAlthough there is a strong deterministic logic central to the representation of \nnanotechnologyxliv, this sense of the momentary control describes the practice of \nactually building nanostructures. For example, Elder discusses polymerisation as a \nway in which nano-scale structures may be contrasted or grown: \n \nFormation of the well-ordered nanophase occurs within concentrated droplets \nas the silica continues to polymerise, and thus it is possible to form any \nsurfactant liquid crystalline phase. Particle coalescence may also occur. A \ngrowing body of evidence supports this phase separation mechanism. \u2026 \nStructural development from disordered spherical micelles to ordered \nhexagonal phases in phase-separated droplets has also been observed \u2026xlv\n \nThis is a curious model of a kind of construction where a nano-scale architecture is \ngrown rather than accomplished. The resulting form, though desired, is perhaps \ntemporary. Indeed, the object of such research is to control the growth in such a \nmanner that it evolves in desired ways. Similarly, take Seeman and Belcher\u2019s \ndescription of the use of biological systems in building complex and functional \nsystems: \n \nIn natural systems, macromolecules exert exceptional control over inorganic \nnucleation, phase stabilisation assembly, and pattern formation. Biological \nsystems assemble nanoscale building blocks into complex and functionally \nsophisticated structures with high perfection, controlled size, and \ncompositional uniformity. \u2026 The exquisite selectivity of complementary \nbiological molecules offers a possible avenue to control the formation of \ncomplex structures based on inorganic building blocks such as metal or \nsemiconductor nanoparticles.xlvi\n \nThis notion of construction entails capitalising on the interactions of biological \nsystems \u2013 in this case rDNA, DNA and protein \u2013 in order to create desired patterns \nand objects. The object here is also control, but a control that is both provisional and \nactive. Both of these design paradigms, though designed to achieve control, are in fact \nmore like specific modes of control. In each, desired constructions \u2013 shapes, \ngeometries and architectures \u2013 are the product of specific and perpetual control. \n 17\nIndeed, what is entailed is the control of interactions and processes in which we \nalways sense, as Deleuze suggest, the possibility of escape. Both Drexler\u2019s \nmechanistic vision of nanotechnology and the more biologically nuanced vision of the \nbio-mimetists create different relations with evolution. Both are ways of \u2018relating to\u2019 \nthe flux caused by the internal evolution and variation of objects at the molecular \nscale and technical design paradigms in this context. Both cultures are ways of \nharnessing and (more significantly) limiting the creative force of evolution.  \n \nThe other version of nanotechnology is more biologically inspired and mimetic. \nInstead of imagining the possibility of simply arranging atoms mechanically, \nbiomimetic nanotechnology aims to capitalise on the functionality of existing \nbiological systems, particularly protein and DNA. However the distinction between \nthese two versions of nanotechnology is never strictly defined as, in a sense, both are \nconcerned with designing nano-scale mechanisms and controlling their operation. For \nmechanistic nanotechnology it is necessary to control the \u2018wild\u2019 Brownian \ninteractions of atoms and molecules to create stable and functional objects. Similarly, \nbio-mimetic nanotechnology requires the precise control of biological systems in \norder to achieve desired and designed outcomes. Despite the hubris of complete \ndesign in nanotechnology, these kinds of nano-scale interventions have produced only \ntemporary states of order. xlvii Whereas in mechanistic versions of nanotechnology it \nis imagined that the complex relations of atomic and molecular particles \u2013 the internal \nmovement of matter that is the equivalent of Deleuze\u2019s machinic phylum \u2013 will be \novercome by the disciplines of design and engineering, in biomimetic nanotechnology \nit is suggests that technical objects will be created by utilising this very complexity. In \nparticular it is suggests that nanotechnologies will be created by modally or by \npiggybacking on existing self-replicating systems such as protein, DNA or rDNA.  \n \nAt issue then is not simply a Deleuzian openness \u2013 or affirmation \u2013 of flux, variation \nand evolution. Indeed, whereas Deleuze appropriates Simondon\u2019s understanding of \nthe spontaneous individuation of technology \u2013 producing a dynamic theory of \ntechnologyxlviii \u2013 both \u2018cultures\u2019 of nanotechnology seek to limit this anarchic \npotential for evolution \u2018all the way down\u2019. Indeed, though biomimetic \nnanotechnology seeks to utilise existing biological machines \u2013 and the artificially \nevolve new forms of such machinery, the real work of such a design paradigm is \n 18\nensuring the stability of the resulting structures and systems. Take for example, \nMichael Conrad\u2019s model of \u2018emergent computation through self-assembly\u2019.xlix He \npresents a framework in which the \u2018self-organising capacities of biological systems \nare extended expressions of nonlinearity inherent in the time evolution of the \nuniverse.\u2019l Biological systems are the emergent, and hence spontaneous, effects of \nnon-linear processes. Conrad suggest that such machines are internally fluctuating, \nchallenging the ways that such systems may be designed or harnessed technically. He \nstates:  \n \nIf a collection of components is allowed to self-organise in the first place \u2026 \nthen self-consistency is automatically ensured. In general such self-organised \naggregates do not perform functions desired by the investigator observing their \nformation, unlike the totally macroscopic machines that are pasted together in \na planned way by a designer with a definite conception in mind. However, the \nadaptivity of self-organising systems allows for moulding of the function in a \nstep by step trial and error fashion, just as biological organisations adapt \nthrough step by step variation and selection. \u2026 Simple reverse engineering of \nexisting biological organisations cannot work, according to the fluctuation \nmodel, since they ignore the hysteretic properties of the vacuum sea.li\n \nConrad\u2019s model is of a moulding of the functions of biological systems, by trial and \nerror. Conrad re-imagines the place of design \u2013 \u2018reverse engineering cannot work\u2019 \u2013 \ninsisting on a level of artisanal intimacy in the creation of human-directed biological \nmachines. The incompleteness of the technical control over the atomic scale \nnecessitates, for Conrad, a more open ended conception of the technological \npossibilities at this scale.  \n \nDeleuze\u2019s evolutionary ethic  \nSuch inventions are provisional stabilisations of processes of chemical synthesis and \nbiological interaction. This is patently not consistent with the vision of \nnanotechnology as being able to \u2018create anything from the bottom up\u2019. Rather, such \ninventions necessitate a Deleuzian sense of the temporality of control and the \nindividuation of technical systems. It is in this sense that Deleuze\u2019s understanding of \nthe dynamism of control finds its material expression. Indeed, Oyama develops a \nnotion the \u2018emergence of control\u2019: \n \nControl of development and behaviour may be said to emerge in at least three \nsenses. First, it emerges in interaction, defined by the mutual selectivity of \ninteracants. Second, it emerges through hierarchical levels, in the sense that \n 19\nentities or processes at one level interact to give rise to the entities or \nprocesses at the next, while upper \u2013level-processes can in turn be reflected in \nlower-level ones. Third, control emerges through time, sometimes being \ntransferred from one process to another.lii\n \nThe crucial point for Oyama, and for Deleuze, is that control emerges. It emerges in \ninteractions with the very processes that are (to be) controlled. This means both that \ncontrol is partial and that design itself emerges with the object. The word emergence \nhere is crucial. In Seeman and Belcher\u2019s constructions of nano-geometries using DNA \nwe might speak of the emergent self-organisation of such structures. The design, \ncontrol and precision necessary to generate such nanoscale geometries emerges with \nthe structures themselves and the processes through which they are formed.  \n \nThe importance, for Deleuze, of the emergence of control is that it signals the \nontological incompleteness of design and the spontaneous variation of technology. \nThis, for Deleuze, is both ontological and ethical and defines his own sense of \nparticular stance in relation to evolution and variation. Deleuze draws strongly on \nBergson\u2019s notion of variation in developing this ethic. He finds in Bergson the idea of \nthe constant repetition of the object (its simulacrum) that suggests that the object is \nopened up, repotentialised, returned as constantly differentiated, constantly multiple. \nIn Deleuzian terms, repetition introduces a form of differentiation that replaces the \nterm IS in the being of the object (X = X = NOT Y) with AND (\u2026X AND Y AND Z \nAND\u2026). \u2018Substitute the AND for IS. A and B. \u2026 The multiple is no longer an \nadjective which is subordinate to the One which divides or the Being which \nencompasses it. It is a noun, a multiplicity which constantly inhabits each thing.\u2019liii\n \nBergson offers a complex and simultaneous analysis of both the \u2018thing-in-itself\u2019 and \nthe thing as an \u2018aggregate of images\u2019. Deleuze sees in Bergson a fundamental critique \nof the notion of categorical difference:  \n \nIf philosophy is to have a positive and direct relation with things, it is only to \nthe extent that it claims to grasp the thing in itself in what it is, in its difference \nfrom all that it is not, which is to say in its internal difference. liv\n \nBergson\u2019s concept of variance becomes crucial. It is a fundamental critique of the \nnotion of categorical difference. Rather than posit a fundamental or essential \n 20\ndifference between objects, Bergson allows difference itself to be something. Objects \ndiffer from themselves\u2014internally. This is not to obliterate distinction but to \nfundamentally reconceive the notion of natural difference. Differentiation acts, \naccording to both Bergson and Deleuze, not between objects, but within objects. For \nboth Bergson and Deleuze matter is anything but a boundary. Rather matter is \ninternally unstable.  \n \nThis material waywardness is not simply metaphorical, or a kind of characterisation \nof matter. Rather it is a waywardness that is based in Deleuze\u2019s molecular ontology \u2013 \nand the internal flux of matter at that scale. It is also inherently personal and ethical, \ndefined by an openness to change and variation, all the way down to the molecular \nlevel. Take, for example, Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s description \u2018becoming-dog\u2019: \n \nYour organism enter[s] into composition with something else in such a way \nthat the particles emitted from the aggregate thus composed will be canine as a \nfunction of the relation of movement and rest, or of molecular proximity, into \nwhich they enter. Clearly, this something else can be quite varied, and be more \nor less directly related to the animal in question.lv\n \nBecoming, in this sense (though often misrepresented) is fundamentally materialist \nethic \u2013 characterised by an openness to variation and internal variation. In Deleuze\u2019s \nontology this \u2018something else\u2019 is always difference itself \u2013 the action of variation and \nflux, in an ethic that enters into a relation with difference itself. It is a kind of atomic \nflux between the object\/subject (of course these terms don\u2019t mean much) and the \nother. It is precisely these same internal variations that are the subject of both design \nand construction in nanotechnology. Deleuze suggests that, because of such self-\ndifferentiating movement and variation, design and construction are more complex \nthat admitted in the hubristic accounts of nanotechnology. For Deleuze design is not \nimposed from without, but emerges from within matter. The fundamental departure \nfor Deleuze on the basis of such an ontology, is to conceive of modes of relating to \nthe evolution of technology. For Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s this ethic \u2013 or even politics \u2013\n\u2018is a question of arraying oneself in an open space, of holding space, of maintaining \nthe possibility of springing up at any point: the movement is not from one point to \nanother, but becomes perpetual, without aim or destination, without departure or \narrival\u2019.lvi\n \n 21\nSuch is to adopt a similar artisanal stance as Conrad\u2019s design by trial and error. For \nDeleuze and Guattari, it is a question of \u2018arraying oneself in an open space\u2019 in the \nsame way that Conrad imagines a trial-and-error design process. Finally then this \nDeleuzian stance, or attitude, is open to the paradox of the individuating endurance of \nboth science and technology, and to possibilities for spontaneous eruption in these \ntemporal arrangements.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe preparation of this paper was supported in part by an ESRC grant RES-338-25-\n0006 and an ARC doctoral fellowship.

Within this complex, even the meaning and definition of the scientific object, gene or \ngenome, let alone further collective unit terms now in use, \u2018proteome\u2019, \u2018 transcriptome\u2019, \n\u2018metabolome\u2019, \u2018phenome\u2019 or \u2018otherime\u2019, have become problematic.

After much scientific and technical \ncommentary, Drexler\u2019s original vision of nano-scale replicators and assemblers was seen to be \nofficially \u2018dismissed\u2019 by the publication of the Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies: \nOpportunities and Uncertainties report by the UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineers \n(London, Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering, 2004).

He states: \n \nFor many nanoists, nano is inevitable and (nano)technology does drive (some of) history. Yet \nthere is little fatalism in the nano community; practitioners seem more eager to ride the tiger \nof nano than they are apprehensive that they will be crushed by it. Nanoists seem, for instance, \nwilling to play with the design logic made possible by the analogy between biological and \nartificial nanomachines. \u2026 Nano is still an incoherent mass of often conflicting communities. \nDeterminist arguments advance the particular interests of various kinds of practitioners within \nthis mass, as well as various critics and supporters on the outside. (ibid, p. 123) \n \nIndeed, in this vein, Drexler adopts a three-way schema for addressing how to build nanostructures and \nobjects\u2014what is \u2018possible\u2019, what is \u2018achievable\u2019 and what is \u2018desirable\u2019. For example: \n \nAs we look forward to see where the technology race lease we should ask three questions. \nWhat is possible, what is achievable, and what is desirable? First, where hardware is \nconcerned, natural laws set limits to the possible. \u2026 Second, the principles of change and the \nfacts of our present situation set limits to the achievable. \u2026 As for what is desirable or \nundesirable, our differing dreams spur a quest for a future with room for diversity, while our \nshared fears spur a quest for a future of safety. (ibid, p.39) \n \n 24\n                                                                                                                                                                      \nDespite the radical ontological commitments of nanotechnology\u2014Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s understanding of the \nfundamentally indeterminate life of matter at the atomic scale\u2014in his schema for how to do \nnanotechnology he adopts a relatively traditional metaphysics. His identification of the possible, the \nachievable and the desirable may be put another way. For Drexler what is possible depends on \u2018what \natoms are\u2019\u2014their ontological being\u2014as \u2018natural laws set limits to the possible\u2019. What is achievable is \ndependent upon one\u2019s ability to technically exploit what is possible; and what is desirable is almost a \nseparate ethical dimension about choosing amongst a range of both possible and achievable scenarios. \nDrexler\u2019s metaphysic is therefore based on a fundamental deduction from an ontology of what atoms \nare to purely technical questions of what is possible and what is achievable. Drexler\u2019s adoption\u2014and \nmore broadly within nanotechnology\u2014 of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s ontology of the atom operates as a natural \nlimit, the absolute context in which what is technically possible and achievable are set. Indeed what is \npossible and achievable are simply cast as purely abstract questions. \nxlv Elder, K. J., \u2018Soap and sand: construction tools for nanotechnology.

They suggest a grand technological lineage linking \ncontemporary advances with an originary technicity. Though not straying into the positivistic terrain of \nthe social-cultural evolutionists, such a theory irreducibly links technology to the \u2018human\u2019. Though \nperhaps respecting the import of the theory of orginary technicity Deleuze also holds out for a \nthoroughly non-human, spontaneous evolution in technical systems and objects.

Conrad\u2019s wider thesis, following Schr\u00f6dinger, is that self-organising \ndynamics of biological systems are an extension of quantum mechanics and general relativity. That is \nto say that Conrad suggests a \u2018great chain of being model\u2019 in which life itself develops on the same \nbasic quantum dynamics as the early universe. He states: \nThe hypothesis that well-defined actions of organisms is underlain by a non-picturable strata \nof possibilities is suggestive of the subjective sense of choice, intention and decision making. \nIn both cases, multiple possibilities are collapsed into a single coherent action. According to \nthe vertical model, multiple possibilities that have an objective reality at the micro-physical \nlevel control the recognition capabilities of macromolecules and through this control the \ninput-output capabilities of neurons. The latter support the self-organisation of multiple \nassemblies of neuronal activity and support the selection of one or a few of these assemblies \nto control the actions of the organism at any given time. The whole process is a hierarchical \ncollapse from a modal world of quantum possibilities into a classical world of actuality. \u2026 To \nexhibit itself in the form of coherent appreciation, choice and action the manifest stratum must \naccumulate intricate constraints that control and are controlled by this interplay. \nConrad, M., From brain structure to vacuum and back again: the great chain of being model. \nNanobiology, 3, 1994, 99-121, p. 120.  \nlii Oyama, S., The Ontogeny of Information: Developmental Systems and Evolution.
