Introduction\nThis paper discusses logistics outsourcing decisions in the European consumer goods\nindustry. Outsourcing or third party logistics is generally defined as the provision of a\nsingle or multiple logistics services by a vendor on a contractual basis (Razzaque &\nSheng 1998). The providers of these services are generally referred to as 3PLs (third\nparty logistics providers). Some definitions of outsourcing contain additional\nconstraints, for example, on the minimum number of services acquired and the\nminimum duration of the contract (Bradley 1994 and Laarhoven et al. 2000).\nOver the past few decades, the European consumer goods industry has experienced a\npower shift from manufacturers and suppliers to retailers, growing emphasis on\nservice and pressure to further cut the level of inventory. Managing consumer goods\ncompanies in this increasingly demanding environment has made many firms turn to\n3PLs for assistance. 3PLs are used for traditional logistics functions, such as transport\nor warehousing and for other services, such as reverse logistics. It has been estimated\nthat about 40% of the global logistics is outsourced (Wong et al. 2000).\nThis study aims to identify the customer perceptions on key logistics outsourcing\ndecisions in the consumer goods industry. In the context of this research, the key\noutsourcing decisions are:\n4\uf0b7 Why outsource?\n\uf0b7 What logistics functions should be outsourced?\n\uf0b7 How to manage satisfaction within a 3PL partnership?\nThe paper will present a literature review identifying a number of research questions\nthat need to be addressed within the context of this environment. It proceeds to\noutline the research method used and finally it reviews the results of the survey,\ncarried out as a part of this study, in the context of other academic research.\n2. Literature review\n2.1. Why Outsource?\nIn this section we give an overview of previous academic works on outsourcing and\naim to identify the specific topics in logistics outsourcing that require further\ninvestigation.\nThe first of the three questions addressed in this article is why do companies\noutsource. Table 2.1 gives an overview of the main reasons as established by five\nprevious studies (P-E International 1994, Boyson et al. 1999, Fernie 1999, Laarhoven\net al. 2000, Penske Logistics 1999). Since different studies use different wording to\nrefer to generically same or similar reasons, the first column is classificatory,\nindicating the area.\nThe table includes double ranking. First, authors of the cited studies ranked the\nreasons. Second, for the purpose of this research, an overall ranking was calculated.\nThis was done by awarding 10 points to the top reason identified by each author, 8\npoints to the second highest reason, 6 to the third, 5 to the fourth and 4 to the fifth. For\neach of the studies, ranking 1 before a reason means that the largest share of\ncompanies surveyed claimed that particular reason to be their primary motivator for\noutsourcing, ranking 2 means that the second largest share of companies outsource for\nthat reason etc. The points were summed up and are presented in the right-hand\ncolumn.\nThe maximum score in Table 2.1 could be 50, in which case all five studies would\nhave found the same reason to be the top driver for outsourcing. The table shows that\ncost reduction (40 points), improvement of service levels (27), increase in operational\nflexibility (26), focusing on core competencies (17), improvement of asset utilisation\n(16) and change management (16) are the most common reasons for outsourcing. We\nwill attempt to assess in the empirical part of the study whether the main reasons for\noutsourcing in the consumer industry match these reasons.\n5Table 2.1.

For compiling this table, the average score of the two was\ncalculated to identify the top 5 overall reasons for outsourcing.\n62.2. What Logistics functions should be outsourced?\nThe second major outsourcing related question is: what logistics activities should be\noutsourced? Table 2.2 summarises the findings of five previous studies on the issue\n(Dapiran et al. 1996, Laarhoven et al. 1998, Boyson et al. 1999, MMH 2001, Sohail &\nSohal 2003). The percentages in brackets refer to the share of companies that use a\n3PL on that particular activity. The following conclusions can be drawn from Table\n2.2:\n\uf0b7 All five studies found that certain aspects of transport are outsourced to a large\ndegree.\n\uf0b7 There are considerable differences in the level that third parties are used on\nwarehousing.\n\uf0b7 Information systems have a low priority in outsourcing. This is in sharp contrast\nwith the fact that many 3PL wish to provide IT related services and have made\nlarge-scale investments in information technology.\n\uf0b7 Almost any logistics activity can be outsourced. For any logistics activity that\nresearchers have included in their surveys, there has always been at least one\ncompany outsourcing that function.\nMost of the articles referred to in Table 2.2 do not specify the criteria used to identify\nthe outsourced areas. It can be assumed that in most cases operations where a third\nparty is used in any way are classified as outsourced. However, this does not\nnecessarily mean that the entire operation is outsourced. Especially in warehousing\nand areas involving advanced technology, a combination of in-house and third party\noperations is very likely.\nAccording to Millen et al. (1997) outsourcing should not be seen as an \u201call or nothing\u201d\nkind of decision. Their analysis suggests that a mixed system, combining the use of in-\nhouse and third party facilities, may prove the best. A recent study among transport\nmanagers in the US food industry also found that 38% the companies have outsourced\nbetween 25 and 99% of their transport (Food Logistics 2002). These arguments lead to\nthe question of whether logistics outsourcing decisions are perceived as \u201call or\nnothing\u201d propositions or do companies prefer the combined use of 3PL and in-house\nresources.\nWhile many studies look at what companies outsource, few researchers have so far\naddressed the issue of what logistics functions should be kept in-house. Therefore we\nwill try to assess which logistics functions are perceived as the best and the worst\nsuited for outsourcing by the European consumer goods companies.\n7Table 2.2.

How to manage satisfaction within a 3PL partnership\nThe third major question addressed in this paper is how to manage a 3PL partnership.\nPrevious studies addressing this question include P-E International 1994, Millen et al.\n1997, Boyson et al. 1999, Laarhoven 2000, Murphy & Poist 2000. Table 2.3\nsummarises these studies. The following conclusions can be drawn from Table 2.3:\n\uf0b7 Users of third party logistics services are usually satisfied with their 3PLs.\nHowever, most studies do not address the details of their satisfaction. Of the\nfive studies presented in Table 2.3, only Millen et al. (1997) go in more depth\nand discuss satisfaction with specific aspects of the 3PL relationship.\nTherefore we will study satisfaction with 3PLs from five facets of the\npartnership.\n\uf0b7 Exchange of information between the logistics service provider and user,\nclarity of contracts and the monitoring and measuring of 3PL performance are\ncommon themes in most studies analysing the success factors in 3PL\npartnerships. Ideally, the set of performance measures should cover a full\nrange of angles: cost, service, productivity, asset management, and customer\nand employee satisfaction (Fawcett & Cooper 1998). Most studies stress the\nimportance of performance measurement, yet it remains often unspecified\nwhich KPIs are or should be used.\n\uf0b7 The main reasons for 3PL relationships to fail relate to cost and poor\ncommunication. However, it must be said that previous research has primarily\nfocused on the success factors rather than the reasons for failure of 3PL\npartnerships. Murphy & Poist (2000) argue that factors or determinants in\nunsuccessful 3PL relationships should be further investigated. Therefore we\nwill attempt to pinpoint the main reasons for 3PL relationships to fail.\n9Table 2.3.

Control\nand performance\nappraisal are more\nimportant to providers\n(6th) than users (15th).\n10\n3. Research methodology\nIn order to clarify questions raised within the literature review, we developed a\nquestionnaire addressing the issues in need of further examination. The survey form\nwas sent to consumer goods companies all around Europe. A number of semi-\nstructured interviews with logistics consultants and managers working in the industry\nwere undertaken. Such a mixed approach, combining a written questionnaire with\ntelephone or face-to-face interviews, provides a comprehensive set of data. The\nquantitative data generated by the questionnaire responses is easily processed on a\nstatistical software package while the qualitative data gathered during the interviews\nadds further insights on the subject.\nThe majority of companies were contacted by telephone before the survey form was\nsent out to ensure that an appropriate person \u2013 usually the logistics manager \u2013 receives\nit. If in three weeks the response had not been received, the companies were\ntelephoned once more to check whether the questionnaire had been received. If not,\nthe questionnaire was mailed for the second time. A cover letter accompanied the\nquestionnaire form explaining the purpose and the reach (Europe-wide) of the study.\nA self-addressed prepaid envelope was enclosed for mailed forms.\nThe statistical population of the survey was made up of all European consumer goods\ncompanies. A total of 330 questionnaires were sent out, primarily in the UK, France\nand Germany. The addressees of the survey were randomly chosen from the electronic\nAmadeus database (http:\/\/amadeus.bvdep.com\/ip). 52 responses were received within\nthe specified timeframe. 50 of the returned forms were usable. This gave a response\nrate of 15%. The UK, France and Belgium represent 78% of all responses. It may\nhence be argued that the responses are biased towards North-western Europe.\nHowever, it should be noted that the country of origin does not necessarily coincide\nwith the only or main location of the company: most firms operate in more than one\ncountry.\n4. Findings of the survey\n4.1. Introduction\nIn this section we discuss the findings of our study. The remainder of the introduction\noutlines the profile of the survey respondents. The rest of the section is structured such\nthat each part is dedicated to one of the three research questions: why to outsource,\nwhat to outsource and how to manage a 3PL partnership.\nThe largest share of survey respondents operate in the fast-moving consumer goods\nsector (46% in non-food and 44% in food), with just over a quarter (26%) being in the\nfashion business. The majority of firms are involved in retailing (54%) or\nmanufacturing (52%). 16% of the respondents are wholesalers. Since companies were\n11\nasked to list all of their industry types and core competencies, the percentages add up\nto over 100.\nThe share of current logistics budget outsourced ranges from 0% to 100%. Such a\nhigh degree of variation implies that the results provide a comprehensive picture of\nthe entire industry, not only that of the companies relying heavily on outsourcing.\nFigure 4.1 demonstrates that the largest share of companies have outsourced between\n30 and 50% of their logistics budget. Complete or nearly complete outsourcing (over\n90%) is exceptional.\n16\n6\n12\n16\n24\n14\n12\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nNot disclosed\nmore than 90%\n70-90%\n50-70%\n30-50%\n10-30%\n10% or less\nL\nev\nel\no\nf\no\nu\nts\no\nu\nrc\nin\ng\n(%\no\nf\nlo\ng\nis\nti\ncs\nb\nu\nd\ng\net\n)\nPer cent of companies\nFigure 4.1. Per cent of the logistics budget outsourced.\n4.2. Why Outsource?\nIn this part we discuss why consumer good companies outsource. The surveyed\ncompanies were asked to list three of their primary reasons for outsourcing. The\nquestion was closed-ended, i.e. a list of options was provided. Figure 4.2 presents the\ntop-scoring reasons graphically.\n12\n8%\n6%\n18%\n38%\n50%\n54%\n54%\n56%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60%\nOther\nLabour considerations\nExpansion to new markets\nAvoiding investment\nFocus on core business\nCost reduction\nOperational flexibility\nCompetencies of 3PLs\nPer cent of companies\nFigure 4.2. Reasons for outsourcing.\nThe literature review showed that costs are the single most common reason for\noutsourcing. However, according to this survey, consumer goods companies choose to\noutsource primarily in order to benefit from the competencies of 3PLs. Flexibility and\ncost objectives are very important too but cost reduction is definitely not an\nuncontested leader. There are several reasons why so few firms outsource for cost\nreasons:\n\uf0b7 Primary business focus is on service, rather than cost. Of the four main drivers\nfor outsourcing (3PL competencies, cost, flexibility and focus on core), only\none is cost related. The other ones are directly or indirectly service-related,\nshowing that service considerations dominate over cost ones. It may be argued\nthat outsourcing decisions in the consumer goods logistics tend to be less cost-\ndriven than they are on average over all industries.\n\uf0b7 Costs are a qualifying, not a winning factor. Companies assume low costs from\n3PLs and make outsourcing decisions on other grounds, such as service.\nSzymankiewicz (1994) even suggests that grocery retailers take both low cost\nand good service from 3PLs for granted.\n\uf0b7 3PLs\u2019 ability to actually lower logistics costs. Our evidence suggests that\nconsumer good companies are aware of the fact that not every outsourcing\ndecision decreases costs and therefore they do not expect cost cuts in the first\nplace. A profit margin charged by 3PLs is reflected in the price for the services\nand may mean that keeping logistics in-house is cheaper than outsourcing.\nAvoiding investment ranks somewhat higher in the list of reasons than the literature\nreview implied. A reason for that may be that the logistics of consumer goods industry\nrequires larger investments than many other industries and companies are therefore\nmore likely to avoid these investments by outsourcing.\nPoor labour availability or quality within the surveyed organisations is not a\nconsiderable driver for outsourcing. This result is in line with the literature review and\n13\nmay be an indication that the historically adverse nature of industrial relations in the\nconsumer goods industry has improved (Hunt 1995, p. 27).\nSome survey respondents outsourced for alternative reasons that had not been\nincluded in the list. Two firms outsourced to solve capacity problems. One company\nwas motivated by a major organisational change (de-merger) and another one was\nlooking to find synergy with the 3PL.\n4.3 What logistics functions should be outsourced?\nAs previously discussed, outsourcing should not be seen as an \u201call or nothing\u201d kind of\ndecision. The survey results confirm this suggestion: 72% of the survey respondents\nuse both 3PLs and the in-house logistics department to manage at least one logistics\nfunction. There are, indeed, logistics functions, where these firms only use either 3PL\nor in-house department. However, the fact that almost three quarters of companies\nhave at least one function where 3PL and in-house are combined implies that mixed\nsystems are common.\nTo assess which logistics functions are seen as the best and the worst suited for\noutsourcing, we asked the companies whether they used 3PLs in eleven logistics\nareas. Table 4.1 shows the preference of survey respondents.\nTable 4.1. Logistics functions most likely to be outsourced, kept in-house or managed\nwith a mixed system (% of companies)\nLogistics functions most\ncommonly fully\noutsourced\nLogistics functions most\ncommonly managed as a\nmixed system\nLogistics functions most\ncommonly kept fully in-\nhouse\nPrimary transport \u2013 68% Additional storage during\npeak periods \u2013 38%\nCarrier selection \u201382%\nSecondary transport \u2013 52% Storage during off peak\nperiods \u2013 34%\nLogistics information\nsystems \u2013 78%\nAdditional storage during\npeak periods \u2013 36%\nSecondary transport \u2013 30% Returns and reverse\nlogistics \u2013 56%\nFleet management \u2013 36% Primary transport \u2013 22% Storage during off peak\nperiods \u2013 44%\nRe-labelling and re-\npackaging \u2013 26%\nReturns and reverse\nlogistics \u2013 20%\nFinal product\ncustomisation \u2013 42%\nBased on the data provided by the survey respondents, an \u201coutsourcability\u201d index was\ncalculated. If all the surveyed companies had fully outsourced a logistics function, the\nindex for that function would equal 100. In the other extreme, if all companies kept a\nlogistics function completely in-house, the index would equal 0. Since companies\nwere asked to reveal their share of 3PLs if they combined 3PL and in-house logistics\n14\ndepartment, we were able to calculate a weighted average level of outsourcing for all\nlogistics functions. The results are presented on Figure 4.3.\n13\n18\n31\n33\n35\n37\n40\n51\n60\n74\n86\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\nCarrier selection\nInformation systems\nReturns processing and reverse logistics\nStorage of products w ith special requirements\nOff peak storage\nFinal product customisation\nRe-labelling and re-packaging\nFleet management\nAdditional storage during peak periods\nSecondary transport\nPrimary transport\nOutsourcability index\nFigure 4.3 \u201cOutsourcability\u201d of different logistics functions.\nBased on Table 4.1 and Figure 4.3, the following can be said about the outsourcing of\nlogistics functions:\n\uf0b7 Transport is the most likely logistics function to be fully outsourced,\nconfirming the results of previous research.\n\uf0b7 Carrier selection is least likely to be outsourced. The companies wish to\npreserve some sort of supervision of their carriers even if transport is\noutsourced. An interview with the logistics manager of a European beverage\nproducer revealed that the company uses about 40 contractors on transport.\nSuch wide selection of haulage companies to choose from adds flexibility to\nthe producer\u2019s operations. Competition between carriers also motivates them\nto deliver better service quality.\n\uf0b7 Regular storage (during off-peak seasons) is usually kept in-house or is shared\nbetween in-house and 3PL. A similar pattern is apparent for storage of\nproducts requiring special conditions, such as certain temperature range,\nhanging garments for companies whose main business is not clothes etc. We\nsee two main reasons behind the dominance of in-house in regular storage.\nFirstly, historic reasons: many companies in mainland Europe had invested\nheavily in the physical logistics network before the 3PL industry had emerged.\nSome companies may still be reluctant to give up their facilities, even though\nthere might be no pragmatic reason to hold on to them (Pach\u00e9 1998, p. 305).\nSecondly, the need for facilities may be very specialist: interviews with several\n15\nlogistics managers and consultants showed that many parts of Europe lack\nsuitable warehousing space of sufficient capacity and storage possibilities.\n\uf0b7 Additional storage during peak periods is usually fully outsourced or co-\nmanaged by the in-house logistics department and a 3PL. This strategy implies\nthat companies are looking for flexibility in their storage activities. While\nregular storage is often kept in-house to utilise the existing facilities, 3PLs are\nused for additional storage during the peak periods of the year, for example,\nbefore Christmas.\n\uf0b7 Outsourcing of logistics information systems has a low priority to most\nconsumer goods companies. The findings of the current study are in line with\nother research. We see three main reasons for keeping information systems in-\nhouse. Firstly, the systems are seen as an essential element of the business.\nEspecially major retailers have invested heavily in information systems to\nensure that up-to-date POS (point of sale) data and forecasts are available. A\nstudy by Andersen Consulting found that investing in POS systems has the\nhighest IT investment priority among retailers (Chain Store Age 2001).\nSecondly, 3PLs are poor at delivering high quality information systems.\nGuti\u00e9rrez and Dur\u00e1n (1997, p. 79) found that many companies are dissatisfied\nwith the quality and integration of information provided by 3PLs. The same\nview was expressed by several of our interviewees. Lastly, many companies\naim for systems integration, for example, logistics system with ERP \u2013\nEnterprise Resource Planning. This is done more easily if all systems are kept\nin-house.\n\uf0b7 Relatively lower percentages in the second column of Table 4.1 indicate that\nmixed system tends to be less common than full outsourcing or full in-house\noperations.\nSo far we have focused on current practices. Yet, companies were also asked how they\nexpected their 3PL and in-house balance to change over the next three years. Almost\nhalf of the respondents (46%) expect to change the 3PL and in-house balance, that is\nto outsource new activities or bring some activities in-house. 40% of respondents\nexpect no changes and the remaining 14% did not disclose their anticipations.\nOf the companies that expect changes to the 3PL and in-house balance, 69% claim\nthat they intend to use 3PLs more than they do now. 22% plan to move logistics more\nin-house. The remaining 9% intend to change the balance but not necessarily by\nincreasing the share of one of the two, for example, by increasing 3PL use on some\nlogistics functions and reducing on others.\nThe changes are most likely to occur in the areas relating to transport or warehousing\nwith over 20% of all companies planning for modifications in those functions. Some\nof the 3PLs that have invested heavily to become 4PLs may find this result\ndisappointing as their clients do not appear to see a strong need for advanced services.\n16\n4.4. How to manage satisfaction within a 3PL partnership?\nIn the last part we present the survey results on the management of 3PL partnerships.\nFirstly we discuss how outsourcing has affected the service user in five areas: cost,\nservice, personnel, added value services and industry-specific knowledge. We asked\nthe companies to compare the values of these indicators before they had outsourced\nand now. See Figure 4.4 for details.\n32\n26\n8\n22\n12\n28\n32\n56\n42\n18\n10\n10\n8\n8\n40\n30\n32\n28\n28\n30\n0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nIndustry specific knowledge\nRange and quality of value added\nservices\nQuality of logistic personnel\nCustomer service level\nDistribution costs per item\nPer cent of companies\nIncrease\nNo change\nDecrease\nNot disclosed\nFigure 4.4. Impact of outsourcing on five aspects of logistics.\nWe observed that consumer goods logistics companies have generally experienced\npositive changes since they began to use 3PLs. The largest effect has occurred in cost\ncontainment: 40% or respondents disclosed that their average distribution costs per\nunit had fallen. The impact on service levels is generally positive, although the largest\nshare of companies reports no change to service levels due to outsourcing.\nWe tested whether there is a correlation between the overall satisfaction with\noutsourced logistics services and the level of outsourcing. The logic behind the\nhypothesis is that if a company is more satisfied with its third parties then it can be\nexpected to outsource a large share of its logistics activities.\nCompanies were asked what percentage of their logistics budget is outsourced and\nwhat changes they have experienced in five categories since they started to use a 3PL,\nas presented in Figure 4.4. To quantify the responses the following calculation was\nmade: positive changes were awarded three points, no change was awarded one point\nand negative changes were awarded zero points. A negative change is, for instance,\ndecrease in the service level due to 3PL use. Points were summed up and converted\ninto an index of satisfaction, ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates only positive\nchanges in all five categories and 0 only negative changes.\nThe 3, 1, 0 scoring system has advantages compared to e.g. 1, 0, -1 scoring system.\nThe latter scoring system may easily lead to a total of zero for different sets of positive\nand negative changes and thus neglect these differences. Also, the 3, 1, 0 system is a\n17\nbetter representation of the expectations of a rational management that having decided\nto outsource logistics, expect improvements in these five aspects.\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nLevel of outsourcing (%)\nL\nev\nel\no\nf\nsa\nti\nsf\nac\nti\no\nn\n(%\n)\nFigure 4.5. Level of satisfaction versus level of outsourcing.\nThe satisfaction index was plotted against the level of outsourcing on to Figure 4.5,\nboth being expressed as on a scale from 0 to 100. Each point on the Figure 4.5 refers\nto one company. The relationship between the level of satisfaction and the level of\noutsourcing is weak (correlation coefficient of 0.48). The satisfaction index only takes\ninto account the five aspects of change brought about by 3PL use shown on Figure\n4.4. We acknowledge the fact that the scale might not explain 100% of variance, i.e.\nthere may be other factors that influence satisfaction with logistics providers.\nThe following implications can be drawn from Figure 4.5:\n\uf0b7 There is a great variety of practices: the level of outsourcing ranges from 0 to\n100 per cent. Also, satisfaction ranges from 0 to 87 per cent.\n\uf0b7 A regression line was plotted on the Figure. It can be seen that the line has a\npositive slope. This indicates that the hypothesis made above about the\nrelationship between the levels of satisfaction and degree of outsourcing is\nindeed true. However, a fairly low correlation coefficient signals that the\nrelationship is weak. Therefore we can see a link between an organisation\u2019s\nexperience and outsourcing although it is not significant. The regression output\nis as follows:\nCoefficients Standard error t Statistic P-value\nIntercept 15.27009 11.9697 1.27572 0.21377\nSatisfaction 0.604656 0.216788 2.78915 0.00996\n18\nP-values show that the coefficient for \u2018level of satisfaction\u2019 is statistically\ndifferent to zero and the coefficient for the intercept is not at 95% confidence\nlevel.\n\uf0b7 There are no companies in the bottom right-hand corner that denotes high level\nof outsourcing but low satisfaction with 3PLs. The implication is that if a\ncompany is not happy with the third party then it is likely to bring the logistics\nactivities back in-house. This means that the companies would move to the\nbottom left-hand corner of the box.\nIt is surprising to note on Figure 4.4 how many companies have not disclosed their\nresponse to the question about level of satisfaction (32% of the companies). This may\nindicate that the companies consider this information to be commercially sensitive.\nAnother explanation is that the companies do not possess that information themselves,\ni.e. they have not measured what the impact of using third parties has actually been.\nThis proposition leads to the questions of what aspects of 3PL performance are\nactually measured.\nMeasuring the performance of third parties provides valuable information about the\nchanges that outsourcing has brought about in terms of cost, service etc. It is also\ncritical to managing the partnership with the 3PLs.\nAn open-ended question in the survey addressed the use of performance measures\namong the respondents. Not surprisingly, a large majority (78%) stated that they use\nsome sort of formalised performance measurement. Only 10% claimed the opposite,\nwhile the remaining 12% did not disclose their strategy.\nCompanies were asked to list the measures they use. Respondents use a wide range of\nperformance measures, some of which are similar in essence. The most popular\nperformance measures focus on service (indicated by 54% of companies) and cost\n(32%). In addition to the standard set of KPIs, some companies have also introduced\nless common measurements to match their specific needs. Performance measures\nlisted by companies were classified and are presented in Table 4.2. Notice should be\ntaken of the fact that as options were not provided, the respondents might not have\nlisted the entire range of KPIs that they actually use.\nTable 4.2.

It is difficult to conceive how\nthe actual measurement is carried out in some of these cases, for example, how fleet\nquality is measured.\nAlthough performance measurement is in place in most 3PL relationships, a vast\nmajority of companies (over 90%) are considering further development of KPIs.\nOne of the most surprising findings of the survey is that 74% of the survey\nrespondents have at least once declined from renewing a 3PL contract with the same\nservice provider. This suggests that the majority of consumer goods companies have,\nat some point, been seriously dissatisfied with the services they receive from the third\nparties. The dissatisfaction has been so significant that the companies have chosen to\nswitch to a different 3PL. Just 10% of respondents claim that they have never\nexperienced problems leading to not renewing contracts with the third parties. The\nremaining 16% chose not to disclose their experiences.\nTable 4.3 demonstrates that the top reasons for not renewing 3PL contracts relate to\nservice and quality (indicated by 68% of companies) and cost (52%). Almost a fifth of\nthe companies also listed communication, trust or responsiveness to changes as a\nreason for non-renewal.\nTable 4.3. Reasons for not renewing contracts with 3PLs\nReasons\nCiting per cent\nof companies\nService and quality issues: poor performance, poor service, customer\nservice problems\n68\nCost issues 52\nTrust and communication problems: poor information flow, relationship\nbreakdown, failure to reach an agreement, culture, inability to help in a\ncrisis situation\n10\n20\nChange management: inability to adapt with changes, lack of innovation 8\nStrategic decisions: decision to go in-house, centralisation of\ndistribution\n4\nPoor management 4\nCompeting offer 2\nFinancial instability 2\nNo value added 2\nAcceptability of trade credit 2\nIt is surprising how many companies have had disappointing experiences with third\nparties. This indicates that the level of 3PLs operating in Europe varies considerably.\nFindings discussed above suggest most companies to be satisfied with their current\n3PL relationships. It appears that most consumer goods companies go through a\nlearning phase until they find a 3PL able to provide sufficient service level.\nQuality, service and cost reasons can be expected to top the list of reasons for non-\nrenewal. It is significant that 18% of the companies realise that \u2018soft issues\u2019, such as\ncommunication and trust problems may lead to the termination of a 3PL relationship.\nThe consumer goods companies might not be willing to accept that communication\nand trust have been an issue because this would mean that the relationship has failed\nat least partially because of the user of logistics services.\nConclusion\nThis Europe-wide survey has provided some useful insights into the customer\nperceptions of 3PLs within the consumer goods sector. It revealed that outsourcing in\nthe consumer goods industry is less cost-driven than other studies have demonstrated.\nVarious aspects of service are more or equally important to cost in the market\ncharacterised by fierce competition and ever-increasing customer focus. The good\nnews for managers of 3PLs is that their customers in the consumer goods industry\nstate competences of 3PLs as the primary reason for contracting out logistics.\nOur survey as well as many previous studies highlights that consumer goods\ncompanies perceive transport to be the best and information systems the worst suited\nfor outsourcing. A large number of practices are in place for managing storage.\nCompanies looking to outsource warehousing often face the lack of suitable facilities\nin terms of capacity and specialist requirements.\nThe combined use of 3PLs and in-house logistics department is often neglected in\nlogistics studies. Our survey showed that over two thirds of companies actually\nmanage at least one logistics function with such a mixed system. Given the flexibility\nit gives to the consumer goods companies we expect the mixed systems to become\neven more popular.\n21\nWhilst the inevitability of performance measurement is repeatedly stressed in\nacademic research, the set of KPIs actually used by consumer goods companies to\nassess their 3PLs has not received significant attention by researchers. We identified\nthat delivery timeliness is the most common performance indicator. This result is\nexpected given that transport is the most common logistics function to be outsourced.\nSurprisingly, though, just about one third of companies stated that they measure the\n3PLs on cost.\nThe survey confirmed the findings of previous research in that the use of 3PLs has\nusually had a positive impact on companies\u2019 performance, especially on cost. At the\nsame time, researchers often understate that outsourcing is a learning experience for a\nconsiderable number of companies. As over 70% of the consumer goods companies\nhave at some point declined from renewing their contract with a 3PL, finding the right\n3PL requires more effort than many firms expect. The primary reasons for switching\n3PLs relate to service. This raises the question of how the learning experience could\nbe made less painful: what features must be present in 3PLs to take an educated guess\nabout the reliability of the service provider?\nFurther research could also address how managerial and balance of power issues are\nhandled where both a 3PL and an in-house department manage logistics. It is worth\nstudying the provider perceptions on the same areas of logistics outsourcing as we did\non the customer perceptions. Finally, a more exhaustive list of the aspects of\nsatisfaction with outsourcing could be studied.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors of this research would like to acknowledge management consultancy Kurt\nSalmon Associates for their sponsorship and assistance on the research.\nReferences\nBoyson, Sandor; Corsi, Thomas; Dresner, Martin and Rabinovich, Elliot.
