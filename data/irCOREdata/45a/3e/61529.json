Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are present in the Arctic and Antarctic to 82 \u00baN \nand 63 \u00baS, respectively, with fine endophyte being the dominant form of AM in roots at \nhigher latitudes. Ecto- (ECM) and ericoid (ERM) mycorrhizas both occur in the Arctic to 79 \n\u00baN, owing to the presence of species of Salix, Dryas, Vaccinium and Cassiope to this latitude. \nECM and ERM are not present in Antarctic ecosystems, owing to an absence of suitable \nhosts. Arbutoid and orchid mycorrhizas are infrequent in the Arctic, whilst the latter is present \nat one location in the sub-Antarctic. Data from studies of AM, ECM and ERM colonisation \nalong a latitudinal transect through the Arctic indicate that the frequency of plant species not \ncolonised by mycorrhizas increases at higher latitudes, largely owing to an increase in non-\nmycorrhizal and a decrease in obligately mycorrhizal plant families at more northerly \nlocations. A separate group of root- and rhizoid-associated fungi, the dark septate root \nendophytes (DSE), are widespread to 82 \u00baN and 77 \u00baS, and are apparently more frequent than \nmycorrhizal fungi in polar regions. The functions of DSE are largely unclear, but studies \nsuggest beneficial effects on plant growth under defined conditions. We advocate further \nresearch into the effects of DSE on their host plants in polar regions. \n \nKeywords: Antarctic, arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), arbutoid mycorrhizas, Arctic, dark sterile \n(DS) fungi, ectomycorrhizas (ECM), ericoid mycorrhizas (ERM), orchid mycorrhizas \n 2 \nIntroduction \nPolar regions are cold, arid and windy. The mean air temperature of the warmest month in \nthese regions is typically <10 \u00baC, usually coinciding with the limits of tree growth \n(Aleksandrova 1980), and their terrestrial habitats are often snow- and ice-covered for several \nmonths of the year, with consequently short growing seasons. They are exposed to continuous \nsunlight or darkness for periods in summer and winter within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, \nparallels of latitude at 66\u00ba 33\u2019 north and south, respectively. Freeze-thaw events are \ncommonplace. These harsh conditions impose strong selection pressures on plants inhabiting \nsuch regions, leading to prostrate, cushion-forming life forms with aerodynamically smooth \ncanopies, fewer woody species and reduced species richness at higher latitudes, both in Arctic \nand Antarctic ecosystems (Rannie 1986; Peat et al. 2007). \n These changes in plant diversity are likely to exert a strong influence over the \nfrequencies and forms of mycorrhizas in polar regions. Mycorrhizas, symbioses between plant \nroots and soil fungi, typically have roles in plant nutrition, facilitating the inflow, via hyphae, \nof limiting nutrients into plant tissues from beyond nutrient depletion zones around roots, and \nthus have pivotal roles in terrestrial ecosystem functioning (Smith & Read 2008). Several \nforms of the symbiosis are recognised, including the arbuscular, ecto-, ericoid, arbutoid and \norchid mycorrhizal associations (Smith & Read 2008). The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) \nassociation typically forms in the roots of herbs and grasses, and is chiefly associated with the \nuptake of phosphorus from neutral temperate soils. The ectomycorrhizal (ECM) association \ndevelops in the roots of woody angiosperms and gymnosperms, whilst the ericoid mycorrhizal \n(ERM) and arbutoid mycorrhizal associations form in the roots of ericaceous species. These \nthree forms of the symbiosis typically have roles in the uptake of nitrogen from acidic soils, \nand often organic forms of the element (Read 1991). Lastly, the orchid mycorrhizas, which \ndevelop in the roots of members of the Orchidales, have more specialised roles in the \ngermination and early growth of orchid seedlings (Smith & Read 2008). \nDespite the fact that changes in plant diversity in polar ecosystems are likely to \ninfluence mycorrhizal distribution, a synthesis of information on the occurrence of \nmycorrhizas in Arctic and Antarctic habitats is apparently absent from the literature. Below \nwe review the literature on these associations in the roots or rhizoids of plants occurring in \npolar regions, including taiga, the sub-Arctic and sub-Antarctic, with the aim of consolidating \ninformation on their distributions in these regions. We also analyse changes in the frequencies \nof AM, ECM and ERM along a latitudinal gradient from taiga through to the High Arctic. \nFinally, information is reviewed on a separate group of root- and rhizoid-associated fungi, the \n 3 \ndark septate endophytes (DSE), and their distribution and functional status are assessed. \nFirstly, however, in order to put this information into context, we describe the geobotanical \nregions of the Arctic and Antarctic. \n \nPolar geobotanical regions \nThe sub-Arctic and Arctic regions can be divided into five geobotanical subzones (CAVM \nTeam 2003). The first of these consists of southern sub-Arctic tundra, usually situated inland \nfrom the Arctic Ocean coast and typically composed of herbaceous plants and dwarf shrubs \nwith a closed canopy, experiencing mean July temperatures (MJuT) of 9-12 \u00baC (subzone E; \nFig 1). The second region, the northern sub-Arctic tundra, consists of herbaceous plants and \ndwarf shrubs but with an interrupted closed canopy. This region, usually located on the Arctic \nOcean coast, experiences MJuT of 7-9 \u00baC (subzone D; Fig 1). Both of these subzones are \nfrequently inhabited by dwarf woody shrubs such as Dryas, Salix, Betula, Vaccinium, \nCassiope and Empetrum, along with sedges, such as Carex and Eriophorum (CAVM Team \n2003). The third region, the southern Arctic tundra, is again formed by herbs and dwarf \nshrubs, but has a more open canopy than subzones D and E, and experiences MJuT of 5-7 \u00baC. \nThis region covers large areas of Baffin and Victoria Islands and frequently forms a narrow \ncoastal border in the Russian and North American Arctic regions and eastern Greenland \n(subzone C; Fig 1). The fourth region, the northern Arctic tundra, consists of an open canopy \nof herbs and dwarf shrubs, with up to 60% cover by cryptogams, and is exposed to MJuT of \n3-5 \u00baC. It covers the offshore islands of the Russian Arctic, the northern Taimyr Peninsula, \nnorthern Greenland and the Queen Elizabeth Islands (subzone B; Fig 1). Although dwarf \nwoody shrubs and sedges are still present in subzones B and C, grasses such as Alopecurus, \nDeschampsia and Poa tend to be more abundant (CAVM Team 2003). Lastly, the fifth \nregion, the Arctic polar desert, consists of mostly barren ground, with lichens and mosses and \nvery sparse vascular plant cover by grasses and cushion forbs such as Papaver, Potentilla and \nSaxifraga. The region experiences MJuT of 0-3 \u00baC and occurs on the offshore islands of the \nRussian Arctic and the northernmost of the Queen Elizabeth Islands (subzone A; Fig 1). \nThe Antarctic can be broadly divided into three geobotanical regions (Aleksandrova \n1980). The first, the sub-Antarctic (Fig 1), consists of, amongst others, Macquarie, Marion, \nand Heard islands, South Georgia and \u00celes Kerguelen. These islands have cool oceanic \nclimates, with mean annual temperatures >0 \u00baC and mean January temperatures (MJaT) of c. \n5-7 \u00baC (Rosswall & Heal 1975; Walton 1984; Smith 1984). Their vegetation is broadly \ncharacterised by grasses, rushes, sedges, ferns and forbs, often tussock-forming species such \n 4 \nas Parodiochloa flabellata, Acaena magellanica and Azorella selago, interspersed with \nnumerous mosses, liverworts and lichens (Aleksandrova 1980; Smith 1984). Woody species \nand dwarf shrubs are absent. The second region, the maritime Antarctic (Fig 1), is \ncharacterised by cold moist maritime climates, with a mean monthly air temperature of >0 \u00baC \nfor 3-4 months of the year and MJaT of \u2264  2 \u00baC (Aleksandrova 1980; Smith 1984). The areas \nof the maritime Antarctic pertinent to this review are the South Orkney and South Shetland \nIslands and the western Antarctic Peninsula and offshore islands to c. 68 \u00baS. The vegetation of \nthe maritime Antarctic consists of herb-lichen-moss formations, with just two vascular plant \nspecies, the pearlwort Colobanthus quitensis and the grass Deschampsia antarctica, occurring \nwith numerous cryptogams (Smith 1984). Finally, the third Antarctic geobotanical region, the \ncontinental Antarctic (Fig 1), consists of the western Antarctic Peninsula south of 68 \u00baS, the \neastern side of the peninsula south of c. 63 \u00baS and Greater Antarctica. The region is \ncharacterised by a frigid and arid climate, with its northernmost limit formed by the 0 \u00baC \nisotherm for the warmest month (Aleksandrova 1980). Approximately 1% of the land is not \ncovered with permanent glaciers. Vascular plants are absent from the region but bryophytes \nand lichens are present in ice-free oases and on nunataks (Smith 1984). \n \nDistributions of mycorrhizas in polar ecosystems \nArbuscular mycorrhizas \nThe arbuscular mycorrhizal association is commonplace in taiga and sub-Arctic tundra (Fig \n1), where it occurs frequently in the roots of members of the Poaceae, Ranunculaceae, \nAsteraceae, Saxifragaceae and Rosaceae. Greipsson et al. (2002) and Treu et al. (1996) \nrecorded AM structures in roots from southern Iceland and at Denali National Park in central \nAlaska (both c. 63 \u00baN), whilst, in sub-Arctic tundra, the association has been recorded at Point \nBarrow (71 \u00baN) on the northern Alaskan coast (Miller & Laursen 1978), at Abisko (68 \u00baN) in \nnorthern Sweden (Michelsen et al. 1996) and in several studies in the Kilpisj\u00e4rvi area (69 \u00baN) \nof north-western Finland (V\u00e4re et al. 1997; Ruotsalainen et al. 2004; Pietik\u00e4inen et al. 2007). \nIn the Russian Arctic, the AM association has been recorded close to Vorkuta (67 \u00baN) in sub-\nArctic tundra (Katenin 1964; Katenin 1972), at unspecified locations in Karelia (Sychuva \n1952, cited in Katenin 1964) and on the Taimyr Peninsula (70-77 \u00baN; Tikhomirov & \nStrelkova 1954; Strelkova 1956).  \nThe AM association apparently declines in abundance in Arctic tundra and polar \ndeserts. Olsson et al. (2004) found that arbuscules and vesicles of AM fungi were frequent in \nthe roots of Arnica, Erigeron and Potentilla species sampled from Banks Island (73 \u00baN), were \n 5 \ninfrequent in the roots of Festuca, Trisetum and Potentilla species sampled from Devon \nIsland (74 \u00baN) and were absent from roots sampled from Ellesmere (76 \u00baN) and Ellef Ringnes \nIsland, close to the magnetic North Pole (78 \u00baN), in which only fine endophyte without \narbuscules was recorded in roots (Olsson et al. 2004). This form of the AM association, \nunlike coarse endophyte, lacks vesicles and possesses slender hyphae, usually < 1.5 \u00b5m in \ndiameter (Merryweather & Fitter 1998). AM structures were found to be absent from the roots \nof all 76 plant species examined from Spitsbergen (77 \u00baN) by V\u00e4re et al. (1992). Kohn & \nStasovski (1990) also showed that of 23 plant species sampled, just one, the fern Dryopteris \nfragrans, was colonised by AM fungi at Alexandra Fjord on Ellesmere Island (79 \u00baN). In a \nstudy at the same location and at Truelove Lowland on the neighbouring Devon Island (75 \n\u00baN), Bledsoe et al. (1990) showed AM to be absent from the roots of 55 plant species. \nHowever, recent reports using differential interference contrast microscopy show that AM are \npresent on Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg islands in the Queen Elizabeth Islands (Fig 1). \nArbuscules, but not vesicles, are present in the roots of an Erigeron and a Taraxacum species \nto 82 \u00baN in the Lake Hazen area on the former island (Ormsby et al. 2007), possibly reflecting \nthe fact that the area becomes a thermal oasis in the summer, owing to its favourable climate. \nSimilarly, Dalp\u00e9 & Aiken (1998) found hyphae and vesicles of AM fungi in the roots of \nFestuca spp. sampled from Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg islands, but only occasional \narbuscules, whereas Allen et al. (2006) recorded abundant (11-36 % of root length colonised) \narbuscules in the roots of six of seven Asteraceae species sampled from the Geodetic Hills \narea of Axel Heiberg Island (80 \u00baN), which, in common with the Lake Hazen area, becomes a \nthermal oasis during the summer.  \nThe AM association is consistently present, and often abundant, in sub-Antarctic \necosystems (Fig 1). It has been recorded at all locations sampled in the sub-Antarctic, most \nfrequently in the roots of the Poaceae and families typically regarded as facultatively \nmycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal, such as the Juncaceae, Cyperaceae and Caryophyllaceae \n(Wang & Qui 2006). Frequent hosts in sub-Antarctic habitats are members of the genera \nDeschampsia, Poa, Juncus, Ranunculus, Uncinia, Colobanthus and Acaena. Christie & \nNicolson (1983) examined roots sampled from South Georgia (55 \u00baS) for fungal colonisation \nand found AM to be abundant in the roots of nine vascular plant species, with 4 - 78% of root \nlengths occupied by these fungi. Subsequently, Smith & Newton (1986) recorded AM \nassociations in the roots of all but one of 24 vascular plant species sampled from Marion \nIsland (47 \u00baS), with between 0.2 and 25% of the root lengths of plants colonised by AM fungi. \nStrullu et al. (1999) found that six of the 17 vascular plant species sampled from \u00celes \n 6 \nKergeulen (49 \u00baS) were colonised by AM structures. Of the 40 plant species examined by \nLaursen et al. (1997) on Macquarie Island (54 \u00baS), arbuscules and vesicles were recorded in \nthe roots of three vascular plant species, and vesicles in fifteen other plant species. Frenot et \nal. (2005), who sampled nine plant species from a variety of habitats on Heard Island (53 \u00baS), \nfound either vesicles, arbuscules or both structures in the roots of all species. Lastly, Upson et \nal. (2008) recorded coarse and fine AM endophytes to occupy 10% and 15% of the root \nlengths of Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis sampled from South Georgia, \nrespectively.  \nContrary to previous reports, recent data indicate that AM are sparse, but present, in \nmaritime Antarctic habitats (Fig 1). In the survey of Christie & Nicolson (1983), plant roots \nwere sampled not only from South Georgia but also from four locations in the South Orkney \nand South Shetland islands, and from six locations on the Antarctic Peninsula to 68 \u00baS. AM \nwere found to be absent from the roots of D. antarctica and C. quitensis, leading Christie & \nNicolson (1983) to propose that mycorrhizas might be absent from the region. Similarly, \nDeMars & Boerner (1995) found no AM structures in the roots of D. antarctica sampled from \nAnvers Island on the western Antarctic Peninsula (65 \u00baS). Other studies, however, have \nchallenged the view that AM are absent from the maritime Antarctic: a recent study that \nsampled widely in the region has shown the presence of AM structures, including occasional \narbuscules, in the roots of D. antarctica sampled from the South Shetland Islands to 63 \u00baS \n(Upson et al. 2008). As in the study of Olsson et al. (2004) in the Arctic, coarse endophyte \nwith arbuscules was very rarely observed in roots sampled from the maritime Antarctic, with \nfine endophyte being the main form of AM recorded (Upson et al. 2008). Cabello et al. \n(1994) similarly showed the presence of AM propagules, and a new AM species, Glomus \nantarcticum, in the rhizosphere of D. antarctica on the Danco Coast of the western Antarctic \nPeninsula (64 \u00baS).  \n \nEctomycorrhizas \nEctomycorrhizas are commonplace in Arctic ecosystems (Fig 1), where they frequently form \non the roots of members of the Betulaceae, Salicaceae and Rosaceae. In taiga and sub-Arctic \nhabitats in Alaska, northern Finland and Siberia, mantles have often been recorded on the \nroots of Betula nana and Salix species, often S. arctica (Miller 1982; Treu et al. 1996; V\u00e4re et \nal. 1997; Michelsen et al. 1998). Dryas octopetala is also colonised by ECM at Abisko in \nnorthern Sweden and Eagle Summit (65 \u00baN) in Alaska (Miller 1982; Michelsen et al. 1998). \nOther plant species colonised by ECM in taiga and the sub-Arctic include Arctostaphylos \n 7 \nrubra, Larix dahurica and Pinus pumila (Miller 1982; Michelsen et al. 1998). Unusually for \nherbaceous species, Polygonum viviparum and Kobresia myosuroides also form ECM in these \nregions (Hesselman 1900; Treu et al. 1996; V\u00e4re et al. 1997; Michelsen et al. 1998).  \nECM are often present in Arctic tundra but are less frequent in polar deserts (Fig 1), \nmost probably reflecting a lack of suitable host species in the latter habitats. Studies on the \neastern coast of Greenland and on Spitsbergen, Devon and Ellesmere islands indicate that S. \narctica is a frequent host for the association, as are Dryas integrifolia and D. octopetala (V\u00e4re \net al. 1992; Michelsen et al. 1998; Bledsoe et al. 1990). P. viviparum and K. myosuroides are \nalso colonised by ECM at the former location (Michelsen et al. 1998), as are K. myosuroides, \nSaxifraga oppositifolia and Pedicularis capitata at Alexandra Fjord on Ellesmere Island \n(Kohn & Stasovski 1990). ECM have also been recorded at Disko Island (70 \u00baN), off the \nwestern Greenland coast, by Clemmensen & Hansen (1999). \nMuch information exists on the species of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the \nroots of Arctic plant species. A few of these records are in planta: mantles similar to those \nformed by Cenococcum geophilum have been recorded in central Alaska (Treu et al. 1996), \nthe northern Alaskan coast (Linkins & Antibus 1982), north-western Finland (V\u00e4re et al. \n1992) and Devon Island (Bledsoe et al. 1990). By contrast, there are many records of \nectomycorrhizal fruiting bodies in Arctic tundra. V\u00e4re et al. (1992) summarise data from \nArctic studies showing S. polaris and D. octopetala to be  associated with approximately 50 \nectomycorrhizal fungal species in the genera Entoloma, Hebeloma, Helvella, Inocybe, \nLactarius, Laccaria, Cortinarius and Russula. Similar genera are present on the northern \nAlaskan coast (Linkins & Antibus 1982) and on the Taimyr Peninsula (Stepanova & Tomilin \n1972), with the last three genera above present at Alexandra Fjord on Ellesmere Island (Kohn \n& Stasovski 1990). A thorough assessment of ectomycorrhizal fruiting bodies in Arctic \necosystems is beyond the scope of this review, but readers are directed to Laursen & \nAmmirati (1982) and Gulden et al. (1985), and subsequent editions of these volumes, for \ninformation on the occurrence of specific groups of ECM fruiting bodies in Arctic tundra.  \nWoody shrubs are absent from the Antarctic, and hence the ECM association is \napparently not present on the continent or its surrounding islands (Fig 1). Horak (1982) \nsimilarly reports the absence of ectomycorrhizal agarics from the maritime and sub-Antarctic.   \n \nEricoid mycorrhizas \nPlant species in the Ericaceae are widespread in taiga and sub-Arctic tundra, and are routinely \ncolonised by ERM in these regions (Fig 1). Vaccinium spp., often V. uliginosum and V. vitis-\n 8 \nidaea but also V. myrtillus, often host ERM in these habitats, as do Cassiope tetragona and \nEmpetrum nigrum (Strelkova 1956; Katenin 1964; Katenin 1972; Miller 1982; Treu et al. \n1996; Michelsen et al. 1996; 1998; V\u00e4re et al. 1997). Ledum palustre and L. procumbens also \nhost ERM in central Alaska and in the Russian sub-Arctic, as does Andromeda polifolia in the \nlatter region and at Abisko (Strelkova 1956; Katenin 1964; Katenin 1972; Miller 1982; \nMichelsen et al. 1996; 1998). Phyllodoce caerulea is similarly colonised by ERM at \nKilpisj\u00e4rvi in north-western Finland and at nearby Abisko, as is Rhododendron lapponicum at \nthe latter location (V\u00e4re et al. 1997; Michelsen et al. 1996; 1998).  \nThe ERM association is also widespread in Arctic tundra, but is apparently absent \nfrom the northernmost of the Queen Elizabeth Islands (Fig 1), most probably reflecting an \nabsence of suitable ericaceous dwarf shrubs from Arctic polar deserts. It has been recorded in \nthe roots of C. tetragona on the eastern coast of Greenland, at Spitsbergen, and on Devon and \nEllesmere islands, and in the roots of Empetrum hermaphroditum at the former two locations \n(Bledsoe et al. 1990; Kohn & Stasovski 1990; V\u00e4re et al. 1992; Michelsen et al. 1998). V. \nuliginosum is also colonised by ERM on Devon and Ellesmere islands and on the eastern \ncoast of Greenland (Bledsoe et al. 1990; Kohn & Stasovski 1990; Michelsen et al. 1998), as \nare R. lapponicum and A. polifolia at the latter location (Michelsen et al. 1998). Clemmensen \n& Hansen (1999) also recorded ERM in dwarf shrub heaths at Disko Island off the western \ncoast of Greenland. \nEricoid mycorrhizas are apparently not present in Antarctic ecosystems (Fig 1), owing \nto an absence of suitable ericaceous plant hosts. However, studies indicate that the typical \nfungal associate of ERM, Rhizoscyphus ericae, is present in the leafy liverwort Cephaloziella \nvarians at Bird Island in the sub-Antarctic, throughout the maritime Antarctic and at one \nlocation in the continental Antarctic (Chambers et al. 1999; Upson et al. 2007).  \n \nArbutoid mycorrhizas \nArbutoid mycorrhizas have been recorded at five locations in taiga and Arctic tundra (Fig 1). \nThe association is present on the roots of Anemone parviflora and Arctostaphylos rubra at \nEagle Summit in Alaska (Miller 1982), and on those of Arctostaphylos alpina in central \nAlaska, Abisko, the eastern coast of Greenland and Disko Island (Treu et al. 1996; Michelsen \net al. 1998; Clemmensen & Hansen 1999). At Alexandra Fjord on Ellesmere Island in the \nHigh Arctic, Kohn & Stasovski (1990) found the roots of Pyrola grandiflora to be colonised \nby arbutoid mycorrhizal fungi. Ericaceous plant species that host arbutoid mycorrhizas do not \n 9 \noccur in the southern hemisphere, and hence this form of mycorrhiza is absent from Antarctic \nhabitats (Fig 1). \n \nOrchid mycorrhizas \nOrchid mycorrhizas are infrequent in taiga and sub-Arctic plant communities (Fig 1). \nHesselman (1900) recorded the formation of these mycorrhizas on Habenaria obtusata and \nChamaeorchis alpina in sub-Arctic Norway, as did Sychuva (1952, cited in Katenin 1964) in \ntwo unspecified orchid species in Karelia. Hitherto, only one record of the orchid mycorrhizal \nassociation exists in Antarctica: Laursen et al. (1997) recorded pelotons in the root cells of the \norchid Corybas dienemus on Macquarie Island in the sub-Antarctic (Fig 1). \n \nPatterns of mycorrhizal colonisation along a latitudinal transect \nIn order to determine how mycorrhizal colonisation might alter along a latitudinal transect, we \nanalysed data from studies that recorded mycorrhizal structures in plant roots sampled from \ntaiga and the Arctic. Studies that examined less than nine plant species or five families in a \ngiven plant community, or examined just one form of mycorrhizal association, were \ndisregarded. A total of 13 studies, examining AM, ECM and ERM colonisation at 11 \nlocations, from Sibik in Siberia (62 \u00baN) to Alexandra Fjord on Ellesmere Island (79 \u00baN), met \nthese criteria. Typically these studies reported either the presence or absence of mycorrhiza in \na given plant species, and not the root length or frequency of root tips colonised by \nmycorrhizal fungi, precluding more detailed analyses. Records of arbutoid and orchid \nmycorrhizas, which were infrequently recorded, were not included in the analyses.  \nSeveral patterns emerged from the analyses. Pearson\u2019s correlations indicated that the \npercentage of plant species in each community not colonised by any form of mycorrhiza \nincreased at higher latitudes (r = 0.711, P = 0.001; Fig 2a). This increase in the percentage of \nplant species not colonised by mycorrhiza at more northerly locations might be explained by a \ndecrease in the number of suitable hosts in colder habitats, as suggested by V\u00e4re et al. (1997), \nwho found an increase in non-mycorrhizal plant species at higher points along an altitudinal \ntransect in northern Scandinavia. We therefore calculated the number of obligately, \nfacultatively and non-mycorrhizal plant families in each plant community along the latitudinal \ntransect. A family was deemed to be obligately, facultatively or non-mycorrhizal if the \nmajority of its species were reported to be so by Wang & Qui (2006). A total of 30, 3 and 13 \nfamilies of gymnosperm and angiosperm trees and shrubs, ferns, horsetails, spike- and \nclubmosses, forbs and grasses from the 13 studies fell into each of these categories, \n 10 \nrespectively. The commonest five obligately mycorrhizal families from which plants were \nsampled were the Poaceae, Ericaceae, Asteraceae, Salicaceae and Scrophulariaceae, and the \nthree facultatively mycorrhizal families were the Equisetaceae, Juncaceae and Saxifragaceae. \nThe commonest five non-mycorrhizal families from which plants were sampled were the \nCaryophyllaceae, Brassicaceae, Cyperaceae, Polygonaceae and Lycopodiaceae.  \nWe expressed the number of plant families in each of the three categories as a \npercentage of the total number of families in each community sampled along the latitudinal \ntransect. These analyses showed there to be a significant increase in the percentage of non-\nmycorrhizal plant families at higher latitudes (r = 0.752, P = 0.001; Fig 2b). Conversely, \nanalyses of the percentage of obligately mycorrhizal families in each plant community \nshowed a significant decrease at more northerly locations (r = -0.772, P < 0.001; Fig 2c). \nThus, it appears that the increase in the frequency of species not colonised by mycorrhizas at \nhigher latitudes (Fig 2a) is caused largely by a lack of suitable host plant families and species \nin more northerly habitats. However, Smith & Read (2008) point out that a lack of suitable \nhost plant taxa in colder habitats does not fully explain reductions in mycorrhizal frequency \n(V\u00e4re et al. 1997), since many species that are suitable hosts are either lightly, or not, \ncolonised by mycorrhizal fungi in such environments. This view was supported by our \nanalyses: there was a marginally significant, negative association between the percentage of \nplant species in obligately mycorrhizal families that were colonised by mycorrhizas and \nlatitude (r = -0.473, P = 0.055; Fig 2d), indicating that, in plant species from families capable \nof forming mycorrhizas, the associations are less frequent at higher latitudes. Because mean \nJuly air temperature (MJuT) was strongly correlated with latitude (r = -0.832, P < 0.001), \nMJuT was also significantly associated with the percentage of plant species in a community \nnot colonised by mycorrhizas (r = -0.611, P = 0.012), and the percentage of non-mycorrhizal \n(r = -0.768, P = 0.001) and obligately mycorrhizal plant families (r = 0.776, P < 0.001) in \neach plant community (Fig 2a-c, insets).  \n \nDark septate endophytes \nSurveys of plant roots from many cold-stressed habitats, including alpine regions (e.g. Read \n& Haselwandter 1981), indicate the prevalence in roots of fungi with dematiaceous septate \nhyphae, the so-called dark septate endophytes (DSE). These fungi, which are not regarded as \ntrue mycorrhizal symbionts (Smith & Read 2008), colonise a wide range of plant taxa \n(Jumpponen & Trappe 1998). They are usually sterile in culture and often form clusters of \nspherical or ovoid cells, termed microsclerotia, in roots. Although these fungi are recognised \n 11 \nin roots by their formation of dematiaceous hyphae and microsclerotia, several studies \nindicate that these dark walled structures are continuous with hyaline septate hyphae in roots \n(e.g. Haselwandter & Read 1982; Newsham 1999), and hence it is likely that their abundance \nhas been underestimated in previous studies (Smith & Read 2008). Despite this, existing data \nsuggest that DSE are more frequent in the roots of plants in polar regions than mycorrhizas: \nstudies in taiga, Arctic tundra and the sub-Antarctic that have each recorded the occurrence of \nmycorrhizas and DSE in the roots of nine or more plant species show that DSE are \ncommonplace, with only one study (Strullu et al. 1999) showing that they are less abundant \nthan mycorrhizas (Table 1). In the four studies that have examined the fungi present in the \nroots of > 20 plant species (Kohn & Stasovski 1990; V\u00e4re et al. 1992; Treu et al. 1996; \nLaursen et al. 1997), DSE have been found to be consistently more frequent than any form of \nmycorrhiza (Table 1). This conclusion is further supported by a recent study indicating that, in \ncontrast to mycorrhizas, the frequency of DSE in roots does not decrease at higher latitudes \n(Upson et al. 2008). Currently little is known of the taxonomic affinities of these fungi. They \nbelong to a wide range of taxa, but are often ascomycetes in the order Helotiales such as \nLeptodontidium orchidicola, Cryptosporiopsis rhizophila or the widely-studied Phialocephala \nfortinii (Jumpponen & Trappe 1998; Addy et al. 2005). \nDSE are commonly recorded in the roots of Arctic plant species (Fig 1), where they \noften occur in the roots of members of the Asteraceae, Poaceae, Ranunculaceae and Rosaceae. \nIn central Alaska, Treu et al. (1996) found microsclerotia of DSE to be present in the roots of \n11 of 40 plant species. In the Troms\u00f8 district of northern Norway, Ruotsalainen et al. (2004) \nalso recorded DSE in the roots of all six of the plant species studied, with between 2% \n(Ranunculus glacialis) and 89% (Solidago virgaurea) of root length occupied by hyphae of \nthese fungi. In the nearby Kilpisj\u00e4rvi area, Ruotsalainen et al. (2002) similarly found that the \nroots of all four plant species studied (Alchemilla glomerulans, Carex vaginata, Ranunculus \nacris and Trollius europaeus) were each colonised by DSE. \nDSE have been recorded at seven locations in Arctic tundra and polar deserts (Fig 1). \nAt Spitsbergen, V\u00e4re et al. (1992) found DSE to be the commonest fungi in roots, with 30 of \nthe 76 plant species sampled being colonised by hyphae of these fungi. At Truelove Lowland \non Devon Island, Bledsoe et al. (1990) similarly found that 33 of the 55 plant species sampled \nwere extensively colonised by intraradical hyphae, of which an unspecified number were \nsimilar to DSE. From the 24 plant species studied at Alexandra Fjord, Kohn & Stasovski \n(1990) frequently recorded septate endophytes in the roots of Festuca brachyphylla, Carex \nnardina, Kobresia myosuroides and Silene acaulis, and less frequently in the roots of 12 other \n 12 \nplant species. In their study of root-associated fungi in the High Arctic, Olsson et al. (2004) \nsimilarly recorded DSE in the roots of seven of 20 plant species sampled from Banks, Devon, \nEllesmere and Ellef Ringnes islands. Septate endophytes were also commonly recorded in the \nroots of Arnica, Erigeron and Taraxacum spp. sampled from Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg \nIslands by Ormsby et al. (2007). Hyphae of these fungi occupied between 27% (A. alpina) \nand 51% (E. eriocephalus) of root length. At the most northerly site from which DSE have \nbeen recorded, Lake Hazen on Ellesmere Island, 45% of the root length of E. eriocephalus \nwas found to be occupied by septate hyphae (Ormsby et al. 2007).  \nDSE are also frequent associates of vascular plant roots in sub-Antarctic ecosystems \n(Fig 1), where they are widespread in the Poaceae, but also present in the Caryophyllaceae, \nJuncaceae, Apiaceae and Asteraceae. Christie & Nicolson (1983) found DSE to be present at \nfrequencies of between 1% and 19% in the roots of eight of 16 plant species sampled from \nSouth Georgia. Of the four grasses examined, the roots of three were found to be colonised by \nDSE (Christie & Nicolson 1983). At the same location, Upson et al. (2008) also found c. 20% \nof the root lengths of C. quitensis and D. antarctica to be colonised by DSE hyphae. On \nMacquarie Island, Laursen et al. (1997) found that the roots of 21 of the 40 species sampled, \nincluding six of the nine grasses, were colonised by intracellular dark septate hyphae. At sub-\nAntarctic Heard Island, Frenot et al. (2005) also found that the roots of seven of the nine \nvascular plant species sampled were colonised by DSE, with the roots of three of the four \ngrasses colonised by these fungi. In contrast, Strullu et al. (1999) found that of the 17 vascular \nplant species sampled from \u00celes Kergeulen (49 \u00baS), just three, none of which were grasses, \nwere colonised by DSE.  \nDSE are also present in the maritime and continental Antarctic (Fig 1). Christie & \nNicolson (1983) found these fungi to be present in the roots of D. antarctica and C. quitensis \nsampled from the South Orkney Islands (60 \u00baS), and in the roots of the former species from \nLivingston Island (62 \u00baS) and Cuverville Island (64 \u00baS). Upson et al. (2008) recently reported \nDSE to be present in the roots of both species at all 14 points sampled on the South Orkney \nIslands, the South Shetland Islands (62 \u00baS) and the L\u00e9onie Islands (67 \u00baS), with dark septate \nhyphae occupying between 3% and 75% of root length. DSE are also present in the rhizoids \nof Cephaloziella varians from the Windmill Islands (66 \u00baS) and Botany Bay (77 \u00baS) in the \ncontinental Antarctic (Williams et al. 1994).  \n 13 \n \nFunctions of mycorrhizas and DSE in polar regions  \nIt is probable that mycorrhizal associations in polar regions have similar nutritional roles, \noutlined in the Introduction, to those that they have in other ecosystems. For example, \nKyt\u00f6viita & Ruotsalainen (2007) found AM to enhance the phosphorus uptake of the Arctic \nplant species Potentilla crantzii and Ranunculus acris under controlled conditions. \nPhosphorus uptake is most probably enhanced by fine endophyte, the main form of the AM \nsymbiosis at high latitudes, since studies indicate that it has a similar role to coarse endophyte \nin enhancing plant phosphorus acquisition (Crush 1973; Smith & Read 2008). Arctic ECM \nalso appear to have similar functions to those of ECM at lower latitudes: Tibbett et al. (1998) \nfound that Arctic Hebeloma isolates utilised a range of organic nitrogen sources, whilst \nHobbie & Hobbie (2006) estimated that 61-86% of nitrogen present in the tissues of Arctic \nplants is provided by mycorrhizal fungi. \nAlthough mycorrhizas in Arctic ecosystems are likely to have similar roles to those at \nlower latitudes, a significant gap in knowledge exists about the functions of DSE in polar \necosystems. Over a decade ago, Gardes & Dahlberg (1996) stated that \u2018because of the \nabundance and widespread distribution [of DSE] in all Arctic and alpine environments, the \nelucidation of their ecological and physiological role is of primary interest\u2019, yet little progress \nhas been made since then of understanding the functional roles of DSE in cold-stressed \nhabitats. Owing to the apparent health of plants from which DSE are isolated, and the paucity \nof AM associations in High Arctic ecosystems, some authors suggest that DSE may act as \nsurrogate mycorrhizas in these habitats (e.g. Bledsoe et al. 1990). The evidence for this is at \nbest fragmentary: whilst DSE are typically isolated from apparently healthy host plants, they \ndo not form highly-branched or convoluted structures in roots to facilitate the efficient \ntransfer of nutrients to their hosts, such as the arbuscules formed by AM or coils formed by \nERM associations. It is therefore precipitous to assume uniformly positive benefits of these \nfungi on their hosts, particularly since some are almost certainly weak pathogens, possibly \nwith asymptomatic but detrimental effects on their host plants (e.g. Newsham et al. 1994). \nFew studies have performed Koch\u2019s Postulates (Koch 1882) on DSE, in which the \nfungi are isolated from roots and then inoculated back onto axenically-grown host plants to \ndetermine their effects on plant growth. This is surprising, given the simplicity of such \nexperiments. This approach was adopted by Haselwandter & Read (1982), who isolated two \nDSE from alpine Carex species and re-inoculated them onto the roots of C. firma and C. \nsempervirens. They found that both isolates enhanced the biomass and phosphorus \n 14 \nconcentration of C. firma plants. Similarly, Jumpponen et al. (1998) found that plants of \nPinus contorta grown in glacier forefront soil with the DSE Phialocephala fortinii absorbed \nmore phosphorus from the soil than those grown without the DSE. When nitrogen was added \nto the soil, P. fortinii also increased plant biomass and nitrogen uptake. In a similar study, \nJumpponen & Trappe (1997) found that P. fortinii increased the root and shoot biomass of P. \ncontorta, but that the DSE decreased nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in plant tissues.  \nRecent data suggest that DSE may have active roles in plant nitrogen acquisition. In a \nstudy on the alpine snow buttercup Ranunculus adoneus, Mullen et al. (1998) showed that \nphosphorus uptake by the plant occurs late in the growing season and is associated with the \ndevelopment of arbuscules in roots. Early in the growing season, R. adoneus takes up large \namounts of nitrogen from the soil, when the frequency of arbuscules in roots is low, but that \nby DSE hyphae is an order of magnitude higher, leading to the suggestion that DSE may have \na role in nitrogen acquisition by roots (Mullen et al. 1998). In a laboratory study, Upson et al. \n(unpublished) similarly showed that, in comparison with uninoculated controls, the growth of \nD. antarctica inoculated with seven DSE isolated from the roots of the species was typically \ninhibited in the presence of an inorganic nitrogen source, but was increased by as much as \n2.5-fold, typically by members of the Helotiales, when seedlings were supplied with an \norganic nitrogen source. This observation suggests that DSE may mineralise organic nitrogen \nin the rhizosphere, making nitrogen more freely available to roots (Upson et al. unpublished), \nand corroborates previous data showing DSE, including P. fortinii and Phialophora finlandia, \nto utilise proteins as sole nitrogen sources (Caldwell et al. 2000). Given the abundance of \norganic forms of nitrogen in polar soils compared with inorganic sources (Kielland 1994), \nDSE might thus play significant roles in the growth and survival of their host plants in the \nnatural environment. \n \nConclusions and future research directions \nOur review reveals consistent trends in the occurrence of mycorrhizas in polar ecosystems. \nThe plant species present in such ecosystems have an overriding influence on the presence of \nthe different mycorrhizal types: ECM, ERM and arbutoid mycorrhizas are apparently absent \nfrom Antarctic habitats, owing to a paucity of suitable host plant species, whereas the former \ntwo mycorrhizal types occur throughout Arctic and sub-Arctic tundra, owing to the \nwidespread presence of Salix, Dryas, Betula, Vaccinium, Cassiope and Empetrum spp. in \nthese regions. In contrast, the AM association is present in both the Arctic and Antarctic, \nowing to the presence of herbaceous plant species in both regions. This association is, \n 15 \nhowever, only sparsely distributed in Arctic polar deserts and the maritime Antarctic, with \nfine endophyte being the dominant form of the AM association in roots at high latitudes. \nArbutoid and orchid mycorrhizas are less frequent than other forms of the symbiosis in Arctic \necosystems. The latter association is present at only one location in the sub-Antarctic. An \nincrease at high latitudes in the frequency of non-mycorrhizal plant families, and a decrease in \nthat of obligately mycorrhizal families, explains a marked rise in the occurrence of Arctic \nplant species not colonised by mycorrhizas at more northerly locations. We suggest that \nfurther work on mycorrhizas in polar regions should utilise PCR-based methods, which are \nlikely to improve the detection of mycorrhizal fungi, and particularly fine AM endophyte, in \nroots and soils from High Arctic tundra and the maritime Antarctic. The reasons for the \nfrequent occurrence in polar regions of AM in the Cyperaceae, Polygonaceae and \nCaryophyllaceae, plant families normally regarded as being non-mycorrhizal, are also worthy \nof further investigation.  \nDSE are probably the most widespread of any root-fungal association in polar regions, \nand yet their roles in plant nutrition and survival are at present poorly defined. The apparent \nhealth of plants with which they are associated suggest the majority do not act as pathogens, \nand recent data indicate that they may have beneficial effects on plant growth and nutrient \nuptake when amino acids, peptides and proteins are the dominant forms of nitrogen available \nto roots. Although there are many different questions about the interactions between DSE and \nplants that are yet to be answered (Mandyam & Jumpponen 2005), we suggest that Koch\u2019s \nPostulate experiments under realistic conditions, coupled with a thorough understanding of \nthe mechanisms responsible for any positive effects on host plant growth, would most \neffectively advance knowledge of these associations. In particular, further work is needed to \ndetermine whether or not organic forms of nitrogen can be mineralised in the rhizosphere by \nDSE and thus made more freely available to roots, or if elements are transported directly from \nsoil to roots via DSE hyphae. Such experiments would resolve the question of whether or not \nDSE have similar functional roles to mycorrhizas in polar regions. \n \nAcknowledgements \nFunding was provided by the Natural Environment Research Council through BAS\u2019s Long \nTerm Monitoring and Survey programme and the Antarctic Funding Initiative (award no. \nNER\/G\/S\/2000\/00318).
