One generalisation is that primary \ncolours, WHITE, BLACK, RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE, are lexicalised before derived \ncolours, which are perceptual blends, e.g. ORANGE  is the blend of YELLOW and RED. The \ncolour systems of Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian offer an important typological \ncontribution. It is already known that primary colour space can retract upon the \nemergence of a basic derived term; our findings indicate that derived categories also shift \nas colour systems develop. Tsakhur offers corroborating evidence. \n \n1 Introduction \nLower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian are part of the West Slavonic branch of languages \nwhich includes Polish, Czech and Slovak. Historically the Sorbs were an extreme part of \nthe Slavs\u2019 push westward around about the 7th century, and their territory has gradually \nbecome encircled by German speakers. The consequence has been that these languages \nare isolated from the rest of the Slavonic family. According to \u0160atava  \n(2005) there are between 20-25 000 Upper Sorbian speakers, but Lower Sorbian fares \nmuch worse with only 7 000 (based on a 1993-5 survey reported in Jodlbauer, Spie\u00df and \nSteenwijk 2001)2. There are no monolingual speakers. This situation means that there is \nan urgency attached to any consultant-based study of the Sorbian language. In the \nsummer of 2000 we carried out consultant work on the lexicon of Lower Sorbian and \n                                                           \n2 We are grateful to a referee for drawing our attention to the most recent surveys on Sorbian speakers. \nCompare the 1987 survey cited by Stone (1993: 594-95) which gives the number of Sorbian speakers as \n3 \nUpper Sorbian. We specifically focused on the semantic field of colour for both \nmethodological and theoretical reasons. On the one hand, there are well developed and \nwell documented field methods for eliciting basic colour terms. And on the other, Berlin \nand Kay\u2019s Basic Colour Terms hierarchy represents a theory of colour universals that has \nbeen insightful to psychologists, anthropologists and linguists. Our findings suggest that, \nwith reference to Berlin and Kay\u2019s theory, both languages lack the full inventory of basic \ncolour terms. As a direct consequence of this, specifically the lack of a basic term for \nPINK, the perceptual colour space of one category, PURPLE, is larger than expected. This is \nof theoretical interest, and we compare these findings with the converse situation in \nTsakhur, a Nakh-Daghestanian language spoken in Daghestan and Azerbaijan, where \nthere is a basic term for PINK but not for PURPLE..  \nIn section 2 we outline Berlin and Kay\u2019s theory about the diachronic changes in a \nlanguage\u2019s colour lexicon: languages develop a core colour vocabulary, a set of basic \ncolour terms which name the eleven perceptual colour categories, and the stages of \ndevelopment follow a set path, or range of paths. Our particular interest is in the \ndevelopment of basic colour terms to name derived colour categories which are the \nperceptual blends of the primary colours WHITE, BLACK, RED, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE. \nBecause of its importance for the model, we explicate the notion of basic colour term, \nand discuss various effective psycholinguistic tests for eliciting basic terms \u2018in the field\u2019 \nwhich we used in our investigation into the colour systems of the Sorbian languages. In \nsection 3 we compare the claims made about the basic colour terms in Sorbian that arise \nfrom dictionary and text based research with the findings from consultant work using \npsycholinguistic tests. We conducted three tests: the \u2018list task\u2019, the \u2018colour naming task\u2019 \n                                                                                                                                                                               \n67000. \n4 \nand the \u2018best example\u2019 task. In section 4 we look specifically at the PURPLE and PINK \nregions in the Sorbian languages. It is known that the structure of primary colour space is \nto some degree dependent on the absence \/ presence of derived colour categories. Given \nour results, we consider the possibility that derived categories can also determine the \ncolour space of other derived categories. Finally we briefly question whether or not \nUpper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian have a second BLUE term, as has been claimed for \ncertain other Slavonic languages. \n \n2 Lexicalization of colour categories \nOf the set of terms denoting colours in a language, there is an identifiable sub-set which \ncould be described as the \u2018core\u2019 colour vocabulary, or the \u2018basic\u2019 set of terms. Working \nwith the notion of basic colour term, Berlin and Kay (1969) developed a theory with \nuniversal claims about the lexical encoding of colour categories. According to the Basic \nColour Terms Hierarchy there is a maximum of eleven basic colour terms, and their \nemergence is universally highly constrained. This is shown in Figure 1.  \n \n \n \n Figure 1. Original Basic Colour Terms Hierarchy (Berlin and Kay) \n \nThe hierarchy can be seen as a constraint on the diachronic development of a language\u2019s \nset of basic colour terms . In the lexicalization of basic colour categories, languages move \nthrough stages 1 to 7. The process is special in that it is monotonic: once a category is \n5 \nlexicalised in a language, the lexicalisation cannot be subsequently reversed. Hence a \nstage 5 language with a BLUE term must have emerged from a stage 4 language which \nlacked a BLUE but had terms for WHITE, BLACK, RED, YELLOW and GREEN. This language \nmay in turn move to stage 6 where a basic term for BROWN will be added. Note that at \nstage 7 there is no predicted ordering with respect to the lexicalization of PURPLE, PINK, \nORANGE and GREY. \n \n2.1 Primary and derived colour terms \nBasic colour terms fall into three groups: those naming primary colour categories, those \nnaming derived categories and those naming composite categories where one term \nsimultaneously expresses several categories.  We will discuss composite colour terms in \nsection 2.1.2. The six primary colour categories (WHITE, BLACK, RED, YELLOW, GREEN, \nBLUE) are the six \u201cpurest-possible\u201d colours that people perceive (MacLaury, 1991: 42). \nWithin the Berlin & Kay theory, focal colours are the seeds around which categories \nform. They are points of local maximum perceptual salience within colour space whose \nprivileged nature derives from presumed universal neurological processes in the visual \nsystem. Kay and McDaniel (1979) referred to these presumed underlying mechanisms as \n\u201csix fundamental neural responses\u201d corresponding to Hering\u2019s (1920) opponent process \ntheory of colour vision.  This claim was based on the apparent discovery of the \nneurological basis of the Hering opponent pairs (red-green, blue-yellow; and dark-light) \nby De Valois, Russell and Jacobs (1968).  However, this has proved to be over-\noptimistic; nevertheless most vision scientists still regard the three axes as the \u201ccardinal \ndirections\u201d in colour space (Krauskopf, Williams, and Heeley, 1982; Lennie and \n6 \nD\u2019Zmura, 1988) common to all with normal trichromatic colour vision, derived from \nlow-level processes in the visual system. The derived categories are the perceptual blends \nof primaries, e.g. ORANGE is the blend of RED and YELLOW. Though the Berlin and Kay \ntheory of the development of basic terms to name the categories has undergone a number \nof revisions, a general principle  remains that primary colour categories are lexicalized \nbefore derived ones. \n \n2.1.1 Reservations \nBoth the idea of a universal perceptual colour space and that of universal focal colours \nhave been questioned.  Proponents of the Whorfian hypothesis argue that colour space is \nat least shaped by language; thus speakers of languages with differing colour categories \nshould also have differing colour perception.  There is ample recent evidence that aspects \nof colour cognition co-vary with language (e.g., Davies & Corbett, 1997; Roberson, \nDavies & Davidoff, 2000), and that colour perception may be modified with relatively \nsmall amounts of training (\u00d6zgen and Davies, 2002).  Nevertheless, such findings can be \nreconciled with the idea of a universal colour space that is invariant at a topological level: \nit may be \u2018shrunk\u2019 or \u2018stretched locally\u2019, but the relative positions of colours do not \nchange.  For example, Roberson, Davies, Corbett and Vanervyver (2005) found that \nperceptual similarity judgements for speakers of languages with markedly different \ncolour categories could all be accommodated in a common colour space defined by the \ncardinal axes.  That is, colours that seemed similar to speakers of one language were also \nseen as similar by speakers of other languages.  On top of this overall similarity, there \nwas also evidence of small scale language influences equivalent to differential stretching \n7 \nor shrinking of the cardinal axes.  However, although a colour space defined by the \ncardinal axes was sufficient to fit these data, it may not have been necessary: some other \naxes might have been at least as sufficient (see, Jameson and D\u2019Andrade, 1997 and \nSaunders and van Brakel, 1997). \nThe idea of universal focal colours has been questioned because some argue that \nthere is more scatter in the choice of best examples, both within and across languages \nthan would be expected if the origin of these was universally \u2018hardwired\u2019 into the visual \nsystem (e.g., Ratner, 1989; Roberson, 2005; Saunders and van Brakel, 1997).  However, \nKay (2005), Kay and Regier (2003), Kay, Regier and Cook (2005) argue that while there \nis some scatter, there is still a strong tendency for best examples to fall in small \n\u2018privileged\u2019 regions of colour space.  Thus best examples are determined by universal \nperceptual processes but these are modulated by other influences at the individual and \nsociety\/cultural level producing the restricted variability seen in the World Colour Survey \ndata (Kay and Regier 2003).  When we compare the best examples of the Sorbian \nlanguages to the universals, operationally all we are really doing is asking whether they \nfall in the 11 regions reported by Kay and Regier (2003). The cognitive significance of \nfocal colours has been questioned by Roberson et al. (2000) who, in contrast to Heider \n(1972), found that memory for focal colours was no better than for non-focal colours for \nthe Berinmo of Papua New Guinea.  However, as Dedrick (2005) points out, perceptual \nsalience is unlikely to be the sole determinant of cognitive performance, and single \ncounter examples are not sufficient to falsify the general rule.  The central role of foci in \ncategory formation has also been questioned while accepting the idea of a broadly \ncommon perceptual colour space.  Category formation might be based on general \n8 \ncognitive principles, such as categories including only contiguous regions and \nmaximising within-category similarity, and cross-category dissimilarity (e.g., Jameson, \n2005; Roberson, 2005). \n \n2.1.2 Revised theory \nAs perceptual blends, derived colour categories are predicated on the primary colour \ncategories. In Figure 1 derived categories appear at stages that follow on from the \nprimaries. Though the Berlin and Kay theory has undergone a number of revisions, the \nprinciple that derived categories only emerge at succeeding stages has remained. Figure 2 \nshows the revised model (Kay and McDaniel, 1978; Kay, Berlin, Maffi and Merrifield \n1997).  \nFigure 2. Revised Berlin and Kay \n \nAt the early stages a language has composite terms, i.e. single colour terms that express \nmore than one primary colour category. For example at stage 1 there is a term which \ndenotes simultaneously the three primary focal colours WHITE, RED and YELLOW. The \ndiachronic path is really \u201cthe progressive differentiation of color categories\u201d (Kay and \n9 \nMcDaniel 1978: 617).  The first step in this process is the division of each composite \ncategory into its distinct primary categories. This is the activity at stages one to five, at \nwhich point the first step is complete. The result of this partitioning is categories that are \ncontiguous in colour space, for example RED and YELLOW. This means that for a stage \nfive language, a term for Red denotes focal Red but also covers points up to, but not \nincluding, focal YELLOW. To capture the qualitative nature of colour terms, colour \ncategories are viewed as fuzzy sets with the \u2018best\u2019 members closest to the focal point, and \nthe \u2018worst\u2019 members furthest away.3 The boundary of a colour category is fuzzy, and at \nthis stage is ultimately set by the focal point of the contiguous category. The second step \nof category differentiation is to distinguish as separate categories the region where \ncolours meet, and these are the derived categories. The category between YELLOW and \nRED is ORANGE. Again using fuzzy set theory, the \u2018best\u2019 ORANGE will be closest to the \nmidpoint between RED and YELLOW.4 This can be seen in Figure 3, a graphical \nrepresentation of the distribution of English colour terms across the chromatic plane (u', \nv') of CIE colour space. CIE stands for Commission Internationale de l\u2019\u00c9clairage. Every \ncolour has a location in the u\u00b4 v\u00b4 coordinate system and this can be understood by \nconsidering the locations of the universal foci which are also shown.  Colours between \nthe universals can be interpreted by interpolation; for instance, as the locus shifts from \nBLUE to GREEN, the colour gradually becomes greener passing through turquoise into the \ngreen category  and on towards the best example of green.  Colour also varies in \n                                                           \n3 See for example Zimmermann (2001) as a guide to fuzzy set theory. \n4 Note that whereas universal foci for primaries have an association with unique hue points, the same does \nnot hold for secondaries; the association here is with the point that is equidistant between two unique hue \npoints (Kay and McDaniel 1978: 638).  \n10 \nlightness, but this axis is orthogonal to the chromatic plane. This means that  BLACK, \nWHITE and GREY have the same chromaticity coordinates and would all fall at the point \nlabelled GREY. (See Appendix 1 for further details).    \nFigure 3. English: loci of tile-colours, with dominant names and the universal foci in the \nCIE (1976) chromaticity diagram \n \nThe \uf0a2 symbol shows the locus of the purported universal focal colours, the \u2018best\u2019 \nmember of the category in fuzzy set terms. The symbols show the loci of the stimuli with \na given name, (see legend on the right). The stimuli closer to the universal are better \nmembers of the category. For ORANGE the universal is clearly midpoint between universal \n11 \nYELLOW and RED. A prediction from the model is that stage six and seven languages, \nwhich have developed derived basic colour terms, should have a retracted primary colour \nspace. There appears to be exaggerated evidence of this from Tsakhur where though the \nterm for YELLOW zirgin denotes focal YELLOW, much of the YELLOW space is covered by \nthe ORANGE term GiIbin.5 We will see that the data from Sorbian suggest that it is not \nonly partitioning of primary colour space that is dependent on the presence of derived \ncolour categories, but derived categories are affected by the absence \/ presence of other \nderived categories. \n \n2.2 Determining basic colour terms \nSince the typological claims about colour outlined above concern the lexicalization of \ncolour categories as expressed by basic colour terms, it is important to have in place a \nmethod for eliciting the basic terms of a language\u2019s colour lexicon. Berlin and Kay \n(1969: 6-7) provide a list of criteria that can be used to characterize the basic terms. First, \nthe term must be shown to be monolexemic, i.e. the meaning is not derivable from the \nsum of its parts. This would rule out sky blue as a candidate for basic status. Second, the \ncolour it signifies must not be included in the signification of another basic term. The \nterm scarlet is a kind of Red, and cannot therefore be basic. Third, it must apply \ngenerally, and not be restricted to a limited number of objects, as is the case with blond \nand ginger which denote hair colour. Fourth, the term must be \u2018psychologically salient\u2019. \nEvidence for a term being psychologically salient is its prominence in an elicited list, its \noccurrence in the idiolects of all consultants, and the stability of its reference across \n                                                           \n5 The Tsakhur colour graph is presented in Figure 6, in section 4. \n12 \nconsultants (Berlin and Kay 1969: 6).  These criteria tend to be strongly associated so that \nbasic colour terms tend to be general, simple and salient. \nA set of tests have been developed which have been widely used to assess the \nsalience of colour terms in a language. Full details of these and other test are reported in \nCorbett and Davies (1995). To summarise, the tests fall into two broad categories. \nLinguistic tests include textual frequency of the terms, and the size of a term's \nderivational family. Behavioural tests, used with language consultants, include colour \nnaming and colour-term eliciting tasks based on the original methods of Berlin & Kay, \nsubsequently modified for the World Colour Survey (Kay, Berlin, Maffi and Merrifield \n2003), and by MacLaury (1997). The data we present is the result of three behavioural \ntests, a \u2018list task\u2019, a \u2018colour naming task\u2019 and a \u2018best example task\u2019. In the list task colour \nterms were elicited by asking consultants to list as many colour terms as they can think of \nwithin a specific stretch of time. The frequency of occurrence of a colour term across \nconsultants, as well as the order in which it occurs on the questionnaires, are used as \nmeasures of the term's salience. Higher frequency and ordering correspond to greater \nlikelihood that the term is basic. In the naming task, colour tiles representative of colour \nspace were named by consultants. The salient terms are marked out by high frequency of \noccurrence and high degree of consensus in the tiles they denote. Finally in the best \nexample task, consultants were asked to choose the best example of the most frequently \nused colour terms from the naming task. This measure is used to check: 1) whether tiles \nwith high naming consensus tend to be chosen as the best examples; 2) the degree of \nvariability across consultants in their choices; and 3) whether the best examples fall close \nto the purported universal foci. \n13 \n \n3 Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian colour survey \nThe Sorbian languages are Slavonic languages spoken within Germany in a small area of \nBrandenburg and Saxony, West of the River Neisse, and East of a line drawn North to \nSouth from Calau, Senftenberg, Kamenz and Bischofswerda (Stone 1993: 593-94).  The \nSorbs of Upper and Lower Lusatia are the descendents of one of the many tribes of the \nNorthwest Slavs who by the 7th century had spread as far west as the Baltic (Schenker \n1995: 46-47). Within the Slavonic family the Sorbian languages belong to West Slavonic, \nsharing features with Czech, Slovak and Polish. All Sorbian speakers are bilingual in \nGerman. A candidate set of basic colour terms for Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian is \ngiven in Stone (1993: 677), deduced from dictionary searches. This is given in Table 1 \nand serves as a starting point for our consultant based study. \n14 \nTable 1.

The exception is Lower Sorbian modry and Upper Sorbian \nm\u00f3dry \u2018blue\u2019, cognates of which are found chiefly in West Slavonic suggesting a West \nSlavonic innovation (see Zar\u0119ba (1954: 47-49) and discussion in Hippisley (2001: 169-\n71)). Regarding the derived terms, the term for \u2018brown\u2019 bruny is the earliest attested \nform, and was most likely a fifteenth century borrowing from Middle High German (see \nSchuster-\u0160ewc 1978: 74). Again BROWN as the first derived category to be lexicalised fits \nwith the Berlin and Kay model (see Figures 1 and 2).  As for the other derived terms \nthere is some doubt over PURPLE since Lower Sorbian purpurowy denotes a crimson \n                                                           \n6Stone lists the alternants ro\u017eany and ro\u017eowaty. \n15 \ncolour, according to Stone. The most recent Lower Sorbian - German dictionary (Starosta \n1999) gives the German purpurn as the equivalent term, a term denoting \u2018crimson\u2019. There \nare two terms with the sense \u2018grey\u2019 in both languages, and Stone notes that there is little \ndistinction between them. There are also two terms which are glossed as \u2018orange\u2019 in \nUpper Sorbian. The psychological salience tests we carried out allow us to explore some \nof the questions raised by Stone\u2019s list. For example we will look to confirm basic status \nof the primary terms, and clarify the status of the terms for the derived categories PURPLE, \nPINK and ORANGE.   \n \n3.1 Results of the list task \nThe list task was carried out by 16 speakers of Lower Sorbian and 16 speakers of Upper \nSorbian. For Lower Sorbian 6 consultants were female and 10 male, and the age ranged \nfrom forty-one to eight-five years; the task was carried out in Cottbus and the \nsurrounding villages8. For Upper Sorbian nine consultants were female and seven male; \nages ranged from thirty-three to fifty, as well as one seventeen year-old; all consultant \nwork was carried out in Bautzen. The questionnaire for both groups was prepared in \nLower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian respectively.9 Tables 2 and 3 give those Sorbian terms \nwhich were offered by least three consultants, the gloss, the frequency of term across all \nconsultants, and the rank frequency. Since the order in which terms are elicited serves as \n                                                                                                                                                                               \n7 Stone lists the alternants r\u00f3\u017eojty and r\u00f3\u017eowaty.     \n8Finding consultants was not easy, and we are very grateful to Madlena Norberg for helping coordinate the \nconsultant work in Cotttbus and surrounding villages. \n9We are also very grateful to Gerald Stone who provided the Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian \ntranslations for the questionnaire.  \n16 \nindex of their salience we also give the mean list position of each term.10 Modified terms \nare counted separately from their related bases, e.g. we show both \u015bamnozeleny \u2018dark \ngreen\u2019 and zeleny \u2018green\u2019 (Table 2), but it should be noted that modified terms are treated \ndifferently in the other tasks. This is because in the list tasks modified terms were not \nsubstituting for their bases: nearly all consultants who offered a modified term also gave \nits unmodified version; and in almost every case the ranking of the modified term was \nlower. For the glosses we consulted Starosta (1999) for Lower Sorbian, and Jen\u010d (1989) \nfor Upper Sorbian. The way in which the consultants used the terms corroborates their \ndefinitions in the dictionary sources, with some notable exceptions  discussed below. \n                                                           \n10For mean position, the calculation gives all subjects a score for all terms.  If a subject does not offer a \nparticular term, then for this calculation it is given a \u2018worst score\u2019 equivalent to that of the lowest term \nactually given plus one. \n17 \nTable 2.

Neither appear in \nStarosta (1999).  \n12 The alternants ro\u017eany and ro\u017eojty were also elicited. \n13 Starosta (1999) gives German equivalents blassblau, graublau \u2018pale blue, grey blue\u2019 as a derived \ndialectal meaning, with fahl, blassgelb \u2018pale yellow\u2019 as the primary meaning. However the way the term \nwas used in the naming and \u2018best example\u2019 tasks suggests it only has a blue meaning in Lower Sorbian. For \n18 \nThe primary terms suggested by Stone are all placed within the eleven most frequent \nterms, and with the exception of terms for BLUE and RED are the highest ranking terms. \nFrom the mean list position scores they also tend to appear towards the top of a list.  \nThough two of the sixteen candidates did not write cerwjeny \u2018red\u2019, those that did placed it \nnear the top of the list (mean list position = 5.19). The mean list position index acts to \nseparate primary from derived terms. The primary terms had a range of 4.31 (b\u0115\u0142y \n\u2018white\u2019) to 8.63 (modry \u2018blue\u2019), while the derived terms fell in the range from with a \nrange 8.87 (\u0161ery \u2018grey\u2019) to 11 (ro\u017eowy \u2018pink\u2019). For the derived terms there appears to be \nconfirmation that bruny is the basic BROWN term, and of the two GREY terms in Stone\u2019s \nlist \u0161ery is within the eleven most frequent terms, and \u0161e\u017aiwy does not appear. The list \ntask also suggests that the basic PURPLE term in Lower Sorbian is not purpurowy (in \nStone\u2019s list) but lylowy which appears on every list bar one. The low frequency of ro\u017eowy \n\u2018pink\u2019 casts doubt on the basicness of this term, as does that of the term given for \nORANGE,  namely oran\u017eowy. Another term for PINK, pinkowy, was offered by three \nconsultants, but two of these also had ro\u017eowy (ro\u017eojty), which was ranked higher. \nSkipping ahead, for the tile most closely representing focal PINK the term pink was used \nby one of these, ro\u017eowy by another and rosa by the third. No single tile was named by the \nterm by more than one consultant, pointing to lack of any consensus in the use of the rival \nterm, an important test for basicness as we shall see in the next section. Finally we should \nnote that there are two terms for BLUE in the list, modry and p\u0142owy. The latter is restricted \nto certain villages north west of Cottbus, and is reported in Fasske, Jentsch and Micha\u0142k \n(1972: 119) as being a dialectal variant of the term. The status of p\u0142owy is discussed in \n                                                                                                                                                                               \nsome consultants it is the basic term for BLUE, as we discuss later in \u00a75. \n19 \nsection 4.1. At this stage the conclusion would be that Lower Sorbian has nine Berlin and \nKay basic colour terms, leaving PINK and ORANGE as emergent categories at best.   \nWe turn now to Upper Sorbian where Table 3 gives the results of the list task.  \nTable 3.

As with Lower Sorbian the first of Stone\u2019s \nterms for GREY, \u0161\u0115ry, has a high frequency. And as with Lower Sorbian the PINK term,  \nr\u00f3\u017eowy, is marginal with a frequency of 62.5% and a mean list position of 11.25; the \n                                                           \n14Included in this term are the alternants noted by Stone, r\u00f3\u017eojty and r\u00f3\u017eowaty.  \n20 \ncandidate ORANGE term, oran\u017eowy, has a very low frequency of 37.5%, and there is no \nappearance of the alternate pomoran\u010dojty.  \nOn the evidence so far we reach the following tentative conclusion. Both Lower \nSorbian and Upper Sorbian have all Berlin and Kay basic colour terms except for a term \nfor ORANGE, and possibly PINK. A difference between the languages concerns PURPLE \nwhere Lower Sorbian has the term lylowy and Upper Sorbian uses the term fija\u0142kowy. The \nterm and its cognates are not basic in any other West Slavonic language. For example \nPolish liliowy is recent (Zar\u0119ba 1954: 53), with the sense \u2018light purple\u2019. Note German lila \nwith the sense \u2018dark purple\u2019.  The term fija\u0142kowy is the adjectival form of fija\u0142ka \u2018violet\u2019, \na borrowing from Middle High German, according to Schuster-\u0160ewc (1978: 74).   \n21 \n \n3.2. Results of the naming task \nIn the naming task consultants are asked on an individual basis to name sixty-five colour \ntiles chosen to represent the colour space. The sixty-five tiles give an even distribution in \nCIE uniform chromaticity space; see Appendix 1 for details about these stimuli. The tiles \nwere shown to consultants in random order. Nearly all the consultants who took part in \nthe list task also performed in the colour naming task.15 Tables 4 and 5 summarise the \nresults. In the tables the sixteen most frequently elicited terms are ranked in frequency \norder. Modified terms have been counted in with simple terms, e.g. sw\u0115t\u0142ocerwjeny \u2018light \nred\u2019 is counted as an instance of cerwjeny \u2018red\u2019.16 Columns 4 to 9 are used to give a \nmeasure of consensus and are discussed below. For the exhaustive set of responses for \neach tile, see Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n15One of the Upper Sorbian consultants who performed the list task did not take part in the colour naming \ntask.  \n16 For this task, unlike the list task, it is usual to combine the modified forms with the simple ones (see for \nexample Davies et al. (1999: 187)).  For example in Lower Sorbian morphologically complex nazeleny \n\u2018greenish\u2019 and \u015bamnozeleny \u2018dark green\u2019 would both be treated as occurrences of the simple zeleny \u2018green\u2019, \nwhich is the head in both expressions. On the other hand, exocentric colour combinations, such as \nro\u017eojtocarwjeny \u2018pink red\u2019, are counted separately. Thus although Appendix 2 lists 58 different colour \nterms for Lower Sorbian and 81 for Upper Sorbian, the actual number when including all modified terms is \n22 \n3.2.1 Lower Sorbian naming task \nTable 4.

The exception is b\u0115\u0142y \u2018white\u2019, \nranked 13th. This should be seen, however, as an artefact of the task, since only one tile \nin the sample could be described as pure white. Moreover this tile was given the same \nlabel, b\u0115\u0142y, by over 90% of all consultants. A simple frequency score is inadequate as a \nmeasure of salience; we also need to score consensus of use amongst consultants. To do \nthis we calculate a term\u2019s \u2018dominance\u2019, i.e. the degree to which it is used for a particular \ntile. The number of tiles for which a term is the most frequently used is recorded in the \nnmf (\u2018number for which most frequent\u2019) column (column 4), for example zeleny \u2018green\u2019 \nis used most frequently for 13 tiles. Amongst those tiles we distinguish those where the \n                                                                                                                                                                               \n125 for Lower Sorbian and 138 for Upper Sorbian.  \n23 \nterm is dominant, meaning that the term in proportion to all terms used to name the tile is \nused more than 50%. A more fine- grained analysis is possible by distinguishing amongst \ntiles dominated by a term: we record separately the number of tiles where the proportion \nis greater than 50% (D50), the number where it is greater than 75% (D75), and where it is \ngreater than 90%. (D90). Thus for zeleny \u2018green\u2019 we see that it is the most frequent term \nfor 13 tiles, but of these it is dominant for 10 tiles (this can be calculated form Appendix \n2, Table A). Amongst the dominant tiles it has over 75% of the share of all terms offered \nfor eight tiles, and over 90% for seven. Dominance is summarised in the last column \nusing the specificity score, which is the proportion of its total use as a dominant term, i.e. \nthe frequency of its uses for its dominant tiles, the dtf given in column 8, over the  \nfrequency of all its uses, given in column 3. For zeleny this is 0.87 meaning that 87% of \nall its occurrences represent high consensus of use amongst consultants. Returning to b\u0115\u0142y \nwe see that though its frequency is lower than the other putative basic terms it has  the \nhighest specificity score (0.94).  \nWe can view the results of the naming task as further evidence that Lower \nSorbian has at least nine basic colour terms, the same as those suggested by the list task. \nThese terms have high frequency rankings and \/ or high specificity scores. As in the list \ntask the term for PURPLE is lylowy, the third most frequent term, and has a high consensus \nindex (dominant for seven out of ten of the tiles for which it is the most frequent term, \nand having a specificity score of 0.72). Other PURPLE terms elicited are wioletny and \nfija\u0142kowy, neither with any claim for basicness (low rank frequency, specificity scores of \n0.00). The list task suggested that Lower Sorbian lacks basic terms for ORANGE and PINK \nand we find further evidence of this from the naming task. The term oran\u017eowy \u2018orange\u2019 \n24 \nhas a low rank frequency, as well as a low consensus index. Though it is the most \nfrequent term for three tiles, it is not dominant for any of them, and this is reflected in its \nspecificity score of 0.00. The term ro\u017eowy \u2018pink\u2019, on the other hand, has a high rank \nfrequency, but again it performs badly on the consensus index with a specificity of 0.14, \ni.e. there has been consensus in the term\u2019s  use on only 14% of all the occasions it was \nused to name a tile. It is only dominant for one tile. From Appendix 2 Table A we see this \nis RVR S3; but as ro\u017eowy as used only nine times for this tile it is barely dominant at 56%.  \nThe graphical representation of the distribution of the Lower Sorbian terms across \nthe chromatic plane of CIE colour space is given in Figure 4. \n \n \n25 \n \nFigure 4. Lower Sorbian: loci of tile-colours, with dominant names and the universal foci \nin the CIE (1976) chromaticity diagram \n \nThe legend in the figure gives the names of the eleven candidate colour terms and a \ncorresponding symbol. The symbols plot the coordinates of the tiles which the term \ndominates. Universal focal points are denoted by the symbol \uf0a1. The graph for Lower \nSorbian is very similar to that of English discussed in section 2 (see Figure 3). The main \ndifferences are found in the PURPLE region, which for Lower Serbian extends nearly as \nfar as focal PINK. The PURPLE space is much more restricted for English.  \n26 \n \n3.2.2 Upper Sorbian naming task \nThe results of the naming task for Upper Sorbian are given in Table 5.  \nTable 5.

There is strong evidence that the PURPLE term for Upper Sorbian is \nfija\u0142kowy, based on both frequency, where it is third most frequent term, and consensus \nwhere it is dominant for eight tiles, and has a specificity score of 0.76. From the list task \nrecall that as in Lower Sorbian doubts surrounded the basic status of terms for PINK and \nORANGE. In the naming task the PINK term r\u00f3\u017eowy has a low frequency and a low \nspecificity score (0.25). It is dominant for one tile, but from Appendix 2 (Table B) we see \nthat it is marginally dominant representing only eight out of fifteen responses (53%) for \ntile RO-T3. This is further evidence against a basic term for PINK in Upper Sorbian. In the \n27 \ncase of PINK evidence from both tests appears to line up, but this is not the case with \nORANGE. Recall that in the list task (Table 3) oran\u017eowy performed particularly badly: it \nhad a frequency of 37.5% and ranking of 15, pushing it well beyond the bounds of the \ngroup of terms considered basic. From Table 5, however, we see that it has a strong \nfrequency ranking of 6 and is dominant for three tiles, two of which it dominates at over \n75%. This is reflected in a strong specificity score of 0.64.  \nThe CIE chromaticity diagram for Upper Sorbian is given in Figure 5. It clearly \nshows an expansion of PURPLE into the PINK region, as with Lower Sorbian.  It should \nalso be noted that for ORANGE in Upper Sorbian, the term oran\u017eowy was dominant for \nthree tiles. We can see from the graph that one of these occupies a point in the colour \nspace that is expected for a basic ORANGE term (comparing with English, figure 3), and \nthe others are closer to YELLOW. \n28 \n \nFigure 5.

All colour terms \nof interest were used for this task, in other words those which through the other tasks \nappeared to be basic, or at least were candidates for basicness. The full set of results is \ngiven in Appendix 3. For each language, we calculated the centroids for each candidate \n29 \nbasic term by averaging the CIE coordinates across the 16 respondents. Thus the centroid \nfor each term is the spatial average in CIE coordinates of the 16 choices of best example.  \nThese centroids are shown in Figure 6 for Lower Sorbian and Figure 7 for Upper Sorbian \ntogether with the locations of the Berlin & Kay universals. \n30 \n  \nFigure 6. Lower Sorbian: loci of centroids for best examples of colour terms and the \nuniversal foci in the CIE (1976) chromaticity diagram \n \n31 \n \nFigure 7. Upper Sorbian: loci of centroids for best examples of colour terms and the \nuniversal foci in the CIE (1976) chromaticity diagram  \n \nFor both languages, it can be seen that the centroid is close to the appropriate universal, \nalthough there is a tendency for the centroids to be displaced towards the centre relative \nto the universals (less saturated). This displacement reflects a limitation of the colour \nsamples in that maximum saturation Color-aid stimuli tend to be less saturated than the \nBerlin & Kay universals.  Choice of best examples was almost invariably from among the \ncolours that evoked high consensus across consultants. This can be seen by comparing \nthe graphs of the location of dominant terms in CIE coordinates (Figures 4 and 5) with \n32 \ntheir equivalent graph of best examples.  It can be seen that the location of best examples \ntends towards the centre of the clusters of dominant terms, suggesting that estimating the \nbest example by selecting the term with the highest consensus would give similar results \nto directly asking consultants.  However, there were exceptions to this rule.  The naming \ndata suggests that Lower Sorbian does not have basic terms for PINK or ORANGE, and \nUpper Sorbian does not have a basic PINK term.  However, although consultants do not \nuse the latter terms reliably in naming, nevertheless, their choices of best example are still \nreasonably close to the appropriate universal.  \n \n4 Discussion: colour category lexicalization and its effect on the colour space \nThe results of the tests outlined above suggest that the two languages under investigation \nlack a PINK term, and that Upper Sorbian probably has a basic ORANGE term, whereas in \nthe Lower Sorbian this term is emergent at best. The most interesting finding, however, is \nthe effect of a weak PINK on the partitioning of colour space. When we translated the \nresults of the naming task into a graph representing the CIE uniform chromaticity space \nthe Purple region appeared to be larger than expected (Figures 4 and 5). In section 2 we \noutlined the progressive differentiation approach to the development of a language\u2019s \ncolour lexicon, and made the point that since primary categories are contiguous and \nfuzzy, the colour space of a primary term is larger in the absence of a related derived \nterm. In the case of Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian, the absence of a derived term, a \nstrong PINK, seems to be affecting the colour space of another derived term, PURPLE, and \nin the same way by letting it expand beyond its expected margins. The case for a basic \nPINK term is even weaker in Upper Sorbian. There is only one dominant PINK tile, and it \n33 \ncorresponds to a point that is wide of the focal point for PINK. The graph clearly shows \nthat the expanded PURPLE region is even more exaggerated than for Lower Sorbian, \nstrongly suggesting the expanded space is the effect of the weaker PINK.  \nThe Sorbian data indicate a dependence of the PURPLE colour space on the \npresence of PINK. This raises the question whether for a colour system with basic PINK but \nnot PURPLE there is a similar dependence for PINK on a PURPLE that is still emerging. \nTsakhur17 has such a colour system according to results using the same elicitation \nmethods and the same tile set as were used for Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian (details \nreported in Davies et al. 1999). Figure 8 is the CIE graph of the results of the naming task \nwhere only dominant tiles have been plotted \n                                                           \n17 Tsakhur is a Nakh-Daghestanian language. In the orthography developed in Kibrik \n(1999), the \u2019 marks ejectives, the I indicates pharyngealisation, G is a voiced uvular stop, \nand X an unvoiced uvular fricative. \n34 \nKey: \u010d\u2019aran \u2018red\u2019, \u010diIwan \u2018green\u2019, zirgin \u2018yellow\u2019, lagarin \u2018blue\u2019, muXak \u2018brown\u2019, \nnabatan \u2018pink\u2019, GiIbin \u2018orange\u2019, aInti:k\u2019a \u2018turquoise\u2019 \n \nFigure 8. Tsakhur: loci of tile-colours, with dominant names and the universal foci in the \nCIE (1976) chromaticity diagram \n \nAgain using English as the point of comparison (see Figure 3), the colour space occupied \nby the Tsakhur terms is broadly similar. Where it differs is in regard to PURPLE and PINK. \nIn Tsakhur the candidate term for PURPLE  \u017eangarin  has no dominant tiles, hence no term \ncovers the PURPLE space. And what we clearly see is the term for PINK nabatan extending \nwell into the PURPLE space, as well as covering the PINK space in the expected way. The \nsample colour space used for the sixty-five stimuli leaves out parts of  the PINK  region, so \n35 \nthere might have been even stronger evidence of PINK extending into PURPLE had the \nsampling been different.  \n \n5 Basic BLUE in Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian \nAs an additional point of interest we briefly consider the status of BLUE in these \nlanguages, as at least three other Slavonic languages are claimed to have two basic BLUE \nterms. Using the elicitation tasks outlined here, Corbett and Davies and collaborators \nhave produced evidence in a number of papers that Russian goluboj \u2018light blue\u2019 is basic, \nalongside sinij \u2018dark blue\u2019 (Corbett and Morgan 1988; Davies and Corbett 1994), and in a \nlater paper Hippisley (2001) argued for two basic BLUE terms in Ukrainian and \nBelarusian: Ukrainian synij \u2018dark blue\u2019 and blakytnyj \u2018light blue\u2019; Belarusian sini \u2018dark \nblue\u2019 and blakitny \u2018light blue\u2019. Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian all belong to the sub-\ngroup known as East Slavonic, whereas Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian are West \nSlavonic. There is no evidence pointing to a second BLUE term in the  West Slavonic \nsister languages, Polish, Czech, and Slovak (see Hippisley, Davies and Corbett 2006 for a \nrecent investigation). And from the three consultant tasks carried out here we find no \nevidence of a second BLUE term in Lower Sorbian and Upper Sorbian. In the list task \nevidence against a second term for BLUE comes in the distribution of terms specifically \nmeaning \u2018dark blue\u2019 and \u2018light blue\u2019, and the term meaning \u2018blue\u2019, without a lightness \ndistinction. For both languages, terms were offered with the glosses \u2018dark blue\u2019 and \u2018light \nblue\u2019: in Lower Sorbian \u015bamnomodry and sw\u0115t\u0142omodry respectively, and Upper Sorbian \n\u0107mowom\u00f3dry and sw\u0115t\u0142om\u00f3dry. However in nearly every case the morphologically \nsimple term m\u00f3dry was offered as well, and where it was given it was almost always \n36 \nranked above the modified terms.  For Lower Sorbian, nine consultants offered a \nmodified term, and only one did not offer modry also. Of the eight who offered modry \nand a modified term, all except one ranked the modified term lower. Five offered modry \nonly, and two offered no blue terms at all. For Upper Sorbian, ten gave modified terms, \nonly two of whom did not also give m\u00f3dry. All of those who gave both terms ranked \nm\u00f3dry higher.  \nWe end this section on Sorbian BLUE by considering the basic status of p\u0142owy \n\u2018blue\u2019 which was offered by nine consultants in the Lower Sorbian list (Table 2, section \n3.1). There is evidence that p\u0142owy is basic for at least two of these, and this would fit with \nthe claim that it is a dialectal variant for BLUE in a small region north west of Cottbus \n(Fasske et al. 1972: 119, 21) where some of the tests were carried out. Of  the nine \nconsultants who offered p\u0142owy in the list task, only three used it in the naming task where \nit was used to name tiles associated with the BLUE colour space. This is shown in Figure \n9. While one of these three also used modry to name BLUE tiles, two used exclusively \np\u0142owy.18  Tiles named as p\u0142owy by all three consultants are represented as shaded crosses, \nthose named by two of the three consultants by unshaded crosses.   \n                                                           \n18 For a discussion on p\u0142owy denoting BLUE in Lower Sorbian, including details on its \netymology, see Steenwijk (2000).  \n37 \n \nFigure 9. Tiles named as plowy \n \n6 Conclusions \nAnalysis of our work with consultants suggests that Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian \nhave colour systems that are still in development. Both lack a basic term for PINK, Lower \nSorbian lacks a basic ORANGE, and  Upper Sorbian seems to have recently acquired a \nbasic ORANGE. Neither language has a second BLUE term, as is claimed to be the case \nwith East Slavonic languages. An interesting theoretical finding is that the  colour \nsystems of two related languages (Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian) and one unrelated \nlanguage, Tsakhur, appear to show the same phenomenon: the colour space of a derived \nterm is a function of that of another derived term. In each case the derived terms in \n38 \nquestion are PINK and PURPLE.  It is already known that primary colour space can retract \nupon the emergence of a basic derived term; Figure 8 shows this dramatically for Tsakhur \nYELLOW in the face of a strong ORANGE term. Our findings suggest that the phenomenon \nis not restricted to primary terms. Rather the derived terms may also undergo further  \nchanges before they themselves are fully settled. \n39 \nReferences \nAndroulaki, A., G\u00f4mez-Pesta\u00f1a, N., Mitsakis, C., Lillo Jover, J., Coventry, K. & Davies, \nI.R.L. 2006.

Fuzzy Set Theory and Its Applications. Dordrecht: \nKluwer. \n44 \n \nAppendix 1. The Stimuli \n \nThe Color-aid system \nThe Color-aid corporation supplies a set of several hundred coloured papers that systematically sample \ncolour space (Foss, Nickerson & Walter, 1944).   The system is based on the Ostwald colour solid. There \nare 24 Hues made up from six cardinal Hues: Y (yellow), O (orange), R (red), V (violet), B (blue) and G \n(green), and intermediate Hues such as OYO (orange yellow orange).  Each Hue has seven variants, four \nTints (T1-T4) and three Shades (S1-S3).  For instance, Y-T1 has the Hue yellow, but is lighter than Y-Hue.  \nFor Tints, the higher the index numbers the lighter the colour.  Shades are created by \u2018adding black\u2019 to the \nHue.  For instance, Y-S1 is darker than Y-Hue.  The table below lists the Color-aid codes of the 65 stimuli \nused in this study together with their CIE coordinates (see below).  Other investigators have used different \ncolour systems such as Munsell (e.g., Berlin & Kay. 1969) Optical Society of America (OSA; e.g., Boynton \n& Olson, 1987) and the Natural Colour System (NCS; e.g., Sivik & Taft, 1994). Provided colour space is \nsampled adequately, it does not matter much which colour samples are used.  For instance, Androulaki, \nG\u00f4mez-Pesta\u00f1a, Mitsakis, Lillo Jover, Coventry and Davies (2006) used NCS, Munsell and Color-aid in \nseparate naming studies of Greek colour terms, and found the same set of basic colour terms in each study.  \nWe used Color-aid here as we have used it many times before and found the set sufficient to detect basic \ncolour terms relatively efficiently (Corbett & Davies, 1995). The CIE co-ordinates allow \u2018translation\u2019 from \nColor-aid to their closest match in other systems. \n \nCommission Internationale de l\u2019\u00c9clairage (CIE) \nWe show our stimuli in the CIE 1976 uniform chromaticity diagram (u' v').  This can be understood by \nconsidering the locations of good examples of Berlin & Kay\u2019s universal categories, and we show these in \nmost figures. For instance, in Figure 3, focal red is towards the right of the diagram; focal green is towards \nthe top-left of the diagram; focal blue is bottom-left; and focal yellow is top-centre.  Achromatic colours \n(white, black and grey, labeled GREY) lie towards the centre of the diagram.  Note that around the co-\nordinate envelope, the sequence of hue changes resembles the traditional colour-circle; for instance, \nmoving clockwise from GREEN gives the hue sequence: green-yellow-orange-red-purple-blue.  BROWN and \nPINK lie inside this envelope (along with the achromatic colours) indicating that they have lower saturation \nthan the main hues.  Distances among the loci represent the perceptual similarity of the colours: the closer \ntogether the more similar they are.  Colours between the focal can be interpreted by interpolation; for \ninstance, turquoise lies between BLUE and GREEN. \nThe following table shows the Color-Aid codes and CIE coordinates of the 65 tiles used in the \nstudy. \n45 \n_________________________________________________________________________ \n Table 1: Color-aid codes and CIE coordinates for the tile-colours \n_________________________________________________________________________ \nColor-aid code    CIE coordinates \n Y x y L* u\u02b9\u2032 v\u02b9\u2032 \n_________________________________________________________________________ \nY HUE 64.77 0.47 0.48 91.49 0.24 0.55 \nS2 16.99 0.41 0.44 52.81 0.22 0.53 \nYOY HUE 47.48 0.50 0.43 80.92 0.28 0.54 \nT4 55.63 0.45 0.41 86.18 0.26 0.53 \nS2 22.08 0.36 0.38 59.09 0.21 0.50 \nYO HUE 39.52 0.51 0.41 75.17 0.30 0.53 \nT3 47.02 0.48 0.41 80.61 0.28 0.53 \nS3 10.72 0.36 0.41 43.02 0.20 0.51 \nOYO HUE 26.51 0.54 0.37 63.81 0.34 0.52 \nO HUE 25.00 0.54 0.37 62.26 0.34 0.52 \nS1 14.34 0.50 0.37 49.03 0.31 0.52 \nS3  9.15 0.42 0.36 39.98 0.26 0.50 \nORO HUE 18.87 0.57 0.34 55.26 0.38 0.52 \nT3 36.88 0.46 0.35 73.09 0.29 0.50 \nS3 26.51 0.33 0.32 63.81 0.21 0.47 \nRO HUE 16.22 0.58 0.33 51.75 0.40 0.51 \nT3 32.66 0.45 0.32 69.56 0.30 0.48 \nS3  4.19 0.37 0.34 27.15 0.23 0.48 \nROR HUE 15.23 0.53 0.31 50.35 0.37 0.49 \nT3 29.82 0.42 0.30 67.00 0.29 0.47 \nS3 20.71 0.34 0.28 57.50 0.24 0.44 \nR HUE 11.71 0.50 0.29 44.78 0.36 0.48 \nT4 24.34 0.40 0.27 61.57 0.29 0.45 \nS3  4.81 0.33 0.30 29.18 0.22 0.45 \nRVR HUE  9.11 0.42 0.24 39.90 0.33 0.43 \nS1 12.79 0.35 0.25 46.60 0.26 0.42 \nS3 28.43 0.36 0.28 65.69 0.26 0.45 \nRV HUE  6.97 0.33 0.19 35.13 0.29 0.37 \nT2 14.51 0.31 0.19 49.28 0.27 0.37 \nVRV HUE  6.71 0.30 0.19 34.48 0.26 0.37 \nS3  8.42 0.36 0.28 65.68 0.26 0.45 \n46 \nV HUE  4.67 0.26 0.17 28.74 0.23 0.34 \nVBV HUE  4.13 0.24 0.17 26.94 0.21 0.34 \nT4 19.05 0.25 0.20 55.49 0.20 0.37 \nBV HUE  4.21 0.22 0.19 27.22 0.18 0.35 \nS2  7.88 0.25 0.26 37.26 0.18 0.42 \nBVB HUE  4.80 0.19 0.13 29.15 0.18 0.28 \nS3 26.65 0.26 0.23 63.95 0.20 0.40 \nB HUE  9.51 0.18 0.16 40.71 0.16 0.32 \nT1 19.02 0.20 0.19 55.45 0.16 0.35 \nBGB HUE  9.62 0.19 0.19 40.93 0.16 0.35 \nT3 23.08 0.20 0.23 60.21 0.15 0.39 \nBG HUE  8.93 0.20 0.25 39.53 0.14 0.40 \nT1 16.57 0.19 0.25 52.24 0.14 0.40 \nS2  7.42 0.21 0.26 36.21 0.15 0.41 \nGBG HUE 10.69 0.23 0.37 42.96 0.13 0.48 \nS2 20.79 0.20 0.25 57.60 0.14 0.40 \nG HUE 11.99 0.24 0.42 45.26 0.13 0.50 \nS3  6.10 0.26 0.33 32.91 0.16 0.46 \nGYG HUE 12.89 0.25 0.44 46.76 0.13 0.51 \nT4 31.14 0.26 0.41 68.21 0.14 0.50 \nS1 15.59 0.26 0.31 50.86 0.17 0.45 \nYG HUE 14.66 0.28 0.48 49.51 0.14 0.53 \nS3  5.78 0.30 0.34 32.04 0.19 0.47 \nYGY HUE 18.92 0.30 0.51 55.32 0.14 0.54 \nS3 35.87 0.35 0.43 72.27 0.19 0.52 \nROSE RED 17.63 0.41 0.24 53.66 0.32 0.43 \nSIENNA 13.31 0.44 0.36 47.43 0.27 0.50 \nWHITE 81.40 0.32 0.33 100.00 0.20 0.47 \nGRAY1 47.55 0.32 0.33 80.97 0.20 0.47 \nGRAY2 30.59 0.32 0.33 67.71 0.20 0.47 \nGRAY4 18.88 0.31 0.31 55.27 0.20 0.46 \nGRAY6 11.20 0.31 0.31 43.89 0.20 0.46 \nGRAY8  4.53 0.31 0.32 28.89 0.20 0.46 \nBLACK  3.59 0.34 0.33 24.98 0.22 0.47 \n47 \nAppendix 2.
