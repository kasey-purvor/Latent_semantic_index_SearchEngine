Embryonic development is a stable process \nwhich follows a ground plan laid down early in gestation. How this develop- \nmental plan is laid down and interpreted has stimulated a great deal of \nexperimental nd theoretical research. The development of biological struc- \nture and form is known as morphogenesis. We hereafter refer to the collective \n490 G.A. Ngwa, P. K. Maini \nmechanisms that lead to the formation of the precursors necessary for specify- \ning various biological structures as pattern formation. \nTwo main types of models have been proposed as possible pattern forma- \ntion mechanisms in a variety of morphogenetic situations: chemical pre- \npattern models and mechanochemical models. From these, two main types of \npatterns have been identified and studied: stationary or spatial patterns and \nspatio-temporal patterns (see Murray [15] for a comprehensive review). Sta- \ntionary spatial patterns that arise from the mechanochemical models have \nbeen analysed and studied in great detail (see, for example, Bentil [1], \nPerelson et al. [19]) while detailed mathematical and numerical analyses of \nmechanochemical models that exhibit spatio-temporal p tterns i still lacking. \nThe key embryonic ells involved in primary pattern formation are the \nmesenchymal (fibroblasts) and epithelial (or epidermal) cells. Mesenchymal \ncells are capable of independent movement within the fibrous material, the \nextracellular matrix (ECM hereafter), in which they are embedded. Epidermal \ncells cannot move freely and are only capable of stretching, thickening or \nfolding. The properties of these two kinds of cells (elasticity and mobility) \nallow a developing embryo the freedom to stretch and arrange its cells in \naggregates. These cell aggregations are an example of spatial patterning, \na very common and vital phenomenon i  development biology. \nIn 1983, Oster et al. [14] proposed a mechanical model for morphogenesis \nwhich was based on the above physical processes. Their analysis howed that \nthese properties can conspire to produce spatial patterns in cell density. This \nmodel was extended to include chemical effects on the physical properties of \ncells and ECM (Oster et al. [18]). The full mechanochemical model is very \ncomplicated but several different simplified versions of the model studied thus \nfar have been shown to exhibit wide-ranging pattern formation properties. \nSee, for example, Perelson et al. [19], Maini and Murray [111 Bentil [1]. \nHere we study spatio-temporal patterns in a simplified version of the \nmechanical model detailed in Murray [15]. Although our analysis is carried \nout on a simplified version of the model, it can be extended to more complic- \nated versions of the mechanical nd mechanochemical models. In Section 2we \nbriefly outline the model equations and investigate he appropriate boundary \nconditions for the model. We carry out a linear analysis in Section 3 for the \nmodel in one-dimension a d show that the uniform steady state can be driven \nlinearly unstable via a Hopf bifurcation. We then perform anonlinear bifurca- \ntion analysis for the case where the uniform steady state goes unstable to \na single mode solution. We investigate he stability of the resulting amplitude \nequations. \nThe two-dimensional model is considered inSection 4. Linear analysis and \nnumerical simulation show that the uniform steady state can be driven \nunstable and evolve to a spatio-temporal solution. In Section 5 we note that \nthe model in two-dimensions can be decomposed into two sub-models, one of \nwhich cannot give pattern, the other of which can. This has been overlooked \nin previous tudies of this system. Hence we can consider only the pattern \nforming sub-model. We further simplify the model and consider the nonlinear \nSpatio-temporal p tterns in a mechanical model 491 \ninteraction of degenerate modes. In Section 6 we carry out a nonlinear \nperturbation analysis for the case of mode interaction and analyse the result- \ning amplitude quations. We compare our analytical solutions with those \nfrom numerical simulation. In particular we show that the system evolves to \na solution composed of all degenerate modes in a frequency locked oscillation. \n2 The mechanical model \nThe basic mechanical model is a continuum model based on two key experi- \nmental observations: (i) cells move on a tissue substratum which is made up of \na fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) [7] (ii) cells can generate very large \ntraction forces which deform the ECM [6]. In this paper, we consider \na simplified version of the mechanical model in which convection and diffu- \nsion are assumed to be the dominant transport processes for cells (we refer the \nreader to the original paper of Oster et al. [14] for full details). The model \nfocuses on pattern formation in the dermis only. \nThe model consists of two conservation equations for cell and matrix \ndensities, respectively, and a force balance quation for the ECM. We denote \nby c(r, t) and p(r, t) the cell and ECM densities, respectively, atposition r and \ntime t and by u(r, t) the displacement vector of the deformed matrix, that is, \na material point in the matrix initially at a position r is deformed to position \nr + u in time t. The simplified model takes the form: \n(i) cell conservation equation: Assuming that convection and diffusion are \nthe dominant ransport processes, we have \nO'-t= -V\"  c-~- +V. (DVc)+rc(N-c )  \nL y ) d i f fus ion  mitos is  \nconvect ion  \nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient, and rN is the linear mitotic rate. \n(ii) matrix conservation equation: We assume that matrix secretion is \nnegligible on the time scale of interest and that matrix moves only due to \nconvection. Hence \n~P -V .  p = \nk ) \nY \nconvection \n(iii) mechanical force balance: The celI-ECM milieu is assumed to be \na linear isotropic visco-elastic ontinuum with stress tensor a and strain \ntensor 8. The coupling between the cells and ECM is in the traction forces \ngenerated by cells as they move in the ECM. Using the standard equilibrium \nequations from the theory of elasticity and including viscous effects, the \nsimplest practical coupling requires that the restraining forces arising from the \nattachment of the cells to the underlying basal membrane (assumed propor- \ntional to the ECM density and its subsequent displacement from the \n492 G.A. Ngwa, P. K. Maini \nunstrained position) should balance with the stress generated by the cells and \nECM (assuming that we are at low Reynolds number). This leads to the \nequation \nI~  ae ~OI + exs + e2OI + px(c ) l l  - sou = 0 V. 1-~ + #2 0tj , ~ , ~ \nvisc~ous elastic traction external \nforces \nwhere ! is the unit tensor and \n= \u00bd(Vu + ruT), 0 = V .u ,  \nE Ev zc \n=- - ,  e2= l+~c 2\" el l+v  ( l+v) (1 -2v)  and ~(c )=- -  \nHere, E and v are, respectively, the Young's modulus and Poisson ratio, #1 \nand #2 are positive constants representing the shear and bulk viscosities while \ns, z and \u00a2 are positive constants.

(~et + flOtI + exe + e20I + p,(c)l) = spu (1) \nPt + V. pu~ = 0 \nwhere the variables and parameters are now nondimensional. \n2.1 Boundary conditions \nWe briefly discuss here the nature of the boundary conditions that may be \nimposed on the system (1). For simplicity, we shall assume that the cells and \nECM have the same behaviour on the boundary of the domain and hence \nsatisfy the same type of boundary conditions; namely homogeneous Neumann \nboundary conditions. Although we will consider spatio-temporal solutions of \nthe model equations, to determine the boundary conditions we consider the \ntime independent counterpart of (1), viz \nDV2c + rc (1 -  c) = ~ } \nV. (el* + e201 + px(c)I) - spu ' (2) \nbecause if the spatial component of the solution satisfies the boundary \nconditions, then the spatio-temporal solution will also satisfy the boundary \nconditions. The only realistic uniform steady state of this system is given by \np = c = 1, u = 0o Here, (2) does not have an equation for p so that if p is not \nconstant, he nature of the displacement field defined by this system (and \nhence the boundary displacements) depends not only on the behaviour of c in \nthe region of consideration, but also strongly on p. \nProposition 2.1. Let f2 be a rectangular region in ~l 2 with Lipschitz boundary \nF and outward unit normal n. Let c, p, ul and u2 ~ LE(Q). I f  c, p and u satisfy \nSpatio-temporal p tterns in a mechanical model 493 \n(2) in the region I~ with V c . n = V p . n = 0 on F, then the boundary displace- \nments that must be imposed on the vector u are of the form \n( ~u~ ~u~'~ \n, .n=O, axl, ).n onr=O (31 \nwhere ui, i = 1, 2 is the displacement in the ith coordinate direction. \nThis means that the normal component of displacement, together with the \nnormal derivative of its tangential component must vanish on the boundary. \nProof. We give the proof for an arbitrary n-dimensional domain f2 and the \ncase n = 2 follows. Consider the linearisation of (2) about the uniform steady \nstate. Let X be the vector X = (c, u, p) and .oq \u00b0 be the linear operator acting on \nthe linear system, ie., \n~X = .W(c, u, p) = V. (el~ + ezOI + (~xP + ZzC)I) - su = 0 o (4) \n0 \nHere, we only require that ~ has the following properties: (i) the inverse of \nexists and is unique, (ii) the adjoint operator ~*  exists and (iii) the \nFredholm alternative theorem holds for the system \u00a3zX =f.  For any linear \ndifferential operator ~ acting on the vector function X satisfying certain \nboundary conditions, repeated integration by parts gives the relation between \nLZ and LZ* in the form \n((x*,  ~ex> - (x,  z*x*>)  = g(x,  X*) (5) \nwhere R(X, X*) represents the boundary contributions from X and X*. To \nsimplify the analysis, we will choose the domain of definition of ~*  such that \nR(X, X*) from (5) vanishes for all X in the domain of definition of \u00a3Z. In \ngeneral, this requirement is enough, for it determines not only the boundary \nconditions for X but also indicates the possible boundary conditions for X*. \nWe construct L~ o* from the linear system and repeated integration by parts \nshows that \nR = Jo { -D[V\"  c*Vc - V. cVc*] + (el + e2) [V. (u*. Vu) - V. (u. Vu*)] \n+ ( 2 + e2) [V.(u x curlu*) - V.(u* x curlu)] \n+ V. [zlpu* + z2cu*-]}dQ. (6) \nUsing the divergence theorem, for the case where O c ~n, n => 3, or Greens \nformula in the plane, for the case where \u00a32 c ~2, we find that R will vanish if \nand only if \nu.n=u* .n=O, (u*xcur lu ) .n=(uxcur lu* ) .n=O onr  (7) \n494 Go A. Ngwa, P. K. Maini \nTherefore, in two space dimensions, for a rectangular domain, the result (3) \nfollows. It follows that prescribing boundary displacements also determines \nthe type of boundary conditions that can be imposed on the cell and ECM \ndensities in the full nonlinear time dependent equations. \n3 One-dimensional analysis \nIn this section, we consider the one-dimensional version of the mechanical \nmodel derived in Section 2 and investigate its pattern formation potential. In \none-dimension, the system (1), with boundary and initial conditions, is\n8c D ~2c (~ (13 ~U) \nO-t- -3~xZ + -~x -~ - rc (1 -  c) = O \n~3u 32u \n~ + ~,Tx ~ + (p~(c)) = spu \n~p a(~u) a~+~ pN =0 \nin f2 (8) \nOc 8p \n. . . .  u=O onx=O,  1Vt>O (9) \nax ~x \np=l ,c=l+f (x ) ,u=O i n f ] fo r t=0,  (10) \nwhere # = ~ + fl, E = el + e2, f~ = {x; x ~ [0, 1]} and f (x) is a random per- \nturbation such that [f(x)l ~ 1. \n3.1 Linear analysis \nWe linearize the system about the realistic uniform steady state, to obtain the \nsystem \nOc OZc ~Zu \n- -  D_----~ + + rc  = 0 \n3Su OZu 3 \n~ + ~ ~ + ~ ('r~p + \"r2\u00a2) - su = 0 (11) \nOp 82u \n~-T + 0--~ =0 \ntogether with boundary conditions (9).

Substitu- \nting the solution form (13) into (11) leads to a linear algebraic system of \nequations whose solvability condition gives the dispersion relation; a poly- \nnomial in 2(k2): \n2[a(k2)2 + b(k2)2 + d(k2)] = 0 (14) \nwhere \na(k 2) = btk 2 \nb(k 2) = D#k 4 + (rbt + E - zl - z2)k 2 + s (15) \nd(k 2) = [Dk 2 + r] [ (E -  zl)k 2 + s] . \nIn equation (14) we note that ifz = 0 then the functions b(k 2) and d(k 2) are \nboth positive giving Re(2(k2)) < 0 Vk 2. This implies, from (13), that all disturb- \nances will decay exponentially with time and the system will return to its \nspatially uniform steady state. We therefore take z > 0 as the bifurcation \nparameter. \nSome algebra shows that for E - zl > 0, the system loses stability at the \ncritical wave number k 2 and the critical bifurcation parameter z\u00a2 where \nz~ = ~ _+ 1 \"4- ~)2 and k~ = o (16) \nA further investigation shows that the inequalities \n(T1 + z2 -- E - r\/z) 2 (r\/z + E)(1 + 4) 2 \ns -  <0,  <z<E( I+~)  (17) \n4D\/~ 2 \nmust be satisfied and it is clear that at (k~, ze), b(k~)= 0 and 2 is purely \nimaginary whenever d(k~, zc)> 0. Thus, when z is increased from z~, the \ncorresponding 2 is complex with positive real part and we have a Hopf \nbifurcation. For the statement and proof of the Hopf bifurcation theorem, see, \nfor example, Hassard et al. [8]. As it is easily verified that all the conditions \nnecessary for a Hopf bifurcation are satisfied, it is clear that the uniform \nsteady state will become linearly unstable only to spatio-temporal patterns. \nWith the boundary conditions (9), the wave number kc is discrete and takes \nthe form \nBy choosing ~, D, E, s, r and ~ appropriately, (16) gives z~ and we can isolate \na particular mode n from (18). See, for example, Perelson et al [19]. \n496 G.A. Ngwa, P. K. Maini \n3.2 Nonlinear analysis of  spatio-temporal patterns \nAt the bifurcation point, the solution of the linear equations may be written in \nthe form \n(c, p, u) = {aexp(iogt + ikx) + bexp(- io~t + ikx)} + cc (19) \nwhere a and b are generalized proportionality functions of time only, and cc \ndenotes complex conjugate. Here we investigate the long time behaviour of \nthe solution (19) with wave number kc, when T is perturbed from zc, of the \nsystem (8) with boundary data (9) near the bifurcation point (kc, z\u00a2). \nSubstituting (cf Lara and Murray 1-171) \n\"\/7 = \"C c -~- \/~2V, \/~ ~ 1, v = _+ 1 (20) \ninto (8), the linear growth rate 2(k 2) changes as follows: \n2(k2,z) ~ 2(k2,z, + e2v) = 2(k2,z~) + e2v + O(e4). \nThus exp(2(k2, z)t + ikx) -* exp(2(k2,z~ + e2v)t + ikx) ,~ a(~2t)exp(2(k 2, z~)t + \nikx) where a(e2t) ok 2 = exp(~l(k~,~c)e t).From the definition of 2, we readily show \nthat \n{ 2c0 + i(Dk 2 + r)(1 + ~) 2(k 2, zc) = - ico 82 tkL,o) 2kt(1 \"~- ~)2(D ' Oz 209 - i(Dk 2 + r)(1 + ~) 2(k2,zc) = log. \n2#(1 + ~)2o9 ' \n(21) \nThe above shows that the amplitude a(e2t) has an initial growth rate (positive) \nand phase given by the real and imaginary parts of the expression in (21) and \nalso indicates that the solution to the perturbed problem of the form (19) will \nhave a and b as generalized functions of e2t. Therefore, we introduce a new \nvariable T = e2t and consider two time regimes t and T which may now be \nregarded as independent variables. Hence, \nd z 0 (22) \nSt \"ot + ~ -~\"  \nWe further assume that c, p and u are functions of x, T, t and e and thus can be \nrepresented as a regular expansion in e such that when e = O, the system is at \nthe uniform steady state, that is \nqt = qto + ~ e\"qt. (23) \nn=l  \nwhere 0 = (c, p, u), ~Oo = (1, 1, 0) and qt. = (e., p., u.). Substituting (23) into \nthe perturbed system and equating coefficients of like powers of 8 to zero, \nreduces it to a hierarchy of linear equations for qt. of the form L(qt.) = R. where \nSpatio-temporal p tterns in a mechanical model 497 \nR., n > 2 are functions of ~,._ l, ~0,-2 . . . . .

Closer observation shows that terms of the form \nexp(_+ iogt +_ ik~x), which are in fact solutions ofL(02) = 0, that will introduce \nunbounded perturbations in the solution do not appear in Rz. Hence the \nsolution at O(e 2) takes the form 0z = O h + 0~ where O h and 0~ are such that \nL(0~ )=0 and L(0~)=R2 o (28) \nWe thus have O~ = (r2a2(T)exp(kot) + w2b2(T)exp(-icot))exp(ik\u00a2x) + cc \nwhere the functions a2 and b2 can be determined by a higher order calculation \nin the analysis.

Then, using \nthe second of (28), we can calculate the vectors S;,j  = 1 . . . . .  9 that appear in \n(29). This therefore determines the solution at O(e2). \nAt O(e3), L(O3) = R3. At this stage, terms of the form exp(+ic0t _+ ik~x), \nwhich are secular terms, appear in R3. These will introduce unbounded terms \nin the solution and must be suppressed. Isolating these terms, we write R3 as \nR3 = -~ + Xlva + X2aa 2 + Xaabb exp(icot + ikcx) \n+ Iio -~  + Ylvb + Y2bb 2 + \u00a53ba8 exp(-i~ot + ik~x) \n+ terms involving only exp(+2ico _+ 2ik~x) + cc. (30) \nwhere, X~ and Y~, i = 0, 1, 2, 3 are the coefficients of the terms in R3 of the form \nshown in (26). \nBy the Fredholm Alternative, a solution of the non-homogeneous problem \nL(0a) = Ra with homogeneous boundary conditions exists if and only ifR3 is \northogonal to the bounded solutions of the adjoint homogeneous problem, \nSpatio-temporal p tterns in a mechanical model 499 \nL*(qtF) = 0, where L* is the adjoint of L and 0F is the associated adjoint \nvariable. Hence, we define the inner product \n(L(03),0,)= lim 1 f f f~  (31) \nNow if Oa and OF are periodic in space with period 2rc\/k\u00a2, we perform the \ndouble integration over one period in space and demand that in the limit as \nT ~ m, (31) should vanish. This is the solvability condition. Now the solution \nof the adjoint homogeneous problem at (k~, Tc) takes the form \n~k* = v 3. a 3. exp(iogt + ik~x) + wFb*exp(- iox + ik~x) -4-. cc (32) \nwhere the superscript \u2022 indicates adjoint variables.

Substituting this into (34) yields two equations for R(T) \nand O(T) of the form \ndR \ndT + ~vR + ~R 3 = O, R dO - -  T + ~zixvR + ~x~R3 = 0 (35) \n\u2022 . i where ~, and aJ,, k -= 1, 2 are real, and ~k = e[ + ~k.

Ngwa, P. K. Maini \n3.3 Stability of the amplitude quation \nWe investigate the linear stability of the time independent solution of the \namplitude quation by substituting R = R \u00b0 + ~(r), where I\/~(r)l ~ 1 into \nthe first of (35) to obtain the linear equation \nd~ \nd--f + (~Iv + 3~i(R\u00b0)2)\/~(r) = 0 .  (36) \nThis shows that R \u00b0 = 0 is stable if a~v > 0 and unstable otherwise, while the \nsolution defined by (R\u00b0) 2= -(~'lv\/~'2)> 0 will be stable if ct~v < 0, and \nunstable otherwise. Hence the two time independent solutions cannot be \nstable simultaneously. Here, we expect e~v, the linear growth factor in the \namplitude quation, to agree with the linear prediction. Some algebra shows \nthat \n(2\u00a2o - i(Dk2 + r)(l + ~)) \n~lv = - 2#(1 + ~)2o9 v, \nwhich agrees with the linear prediction (21) from the linear stability analysis. \nThis corresponds to the case 2(k~ 2,zc) = ion. The case for 2(k~, zc) = - ie) is the \ncomplex conjugate of this expression\u00b0 \nThe trivial solution Re= 0 bifurcates to the non-trivial solution at \ne~v = 0. Therefore, when the non-trivial time independent solution exists, it \nwill be stable for ely < 0, and unstable for e[v > 0. Now, the first of (35) has \nthe general solution \nR2 = -x l~v  (37) \ntcl~ - exp(2~vT) \nwhere ~:i is a constant of integration. The general solution (37) indicates that \nfor ~v  < 0, the bifurcation is supercritical if a[ > 0 and subcritical otherwise. \nIn the event of a supercritical bifurcation, the second of (35) gives O(T) and we \ndeduce that, in the limit as T ~ oo, the amplitude function oscillates in time \nwith a finite amplitude and phase given by \n- (e lez - e~ei)vT R2(T~) = --e~v ~ ' a'2 ' o(roo) = ~ + a constant. (38) \nHence, the leading order behaviour of the solution on the t-scale is \np(x, t)l = + epl(x, t) + O(e 2) (39) \nu(x, t) ] ~u~ (x, t) + 0(~ 2) \nwhere \nCI(X , t) = IvxalR(e2t)cos(cot + 0(e2t) + TH)cos(k,x) \n#1 (x, t) = R (ezt) cos (O)t + O(e2t)) cos (k~x) \nul (x, t) R~;t)cos( n) = cot + 0(~2t) + ~ sin(k~x) \nand 711 = arg(vll), k~ = n~, n = 1, 2 . . . .  , e = x\/@- - z~). \nSpatio-temporal patterns in a mechanical model 501 \nThese solutions oscillate in time with frequency 2n\/~0 + 0(82). Since we \nare only interested in the leading order behaviour of the asymptotic solution \nof the original partial differential equations, the above approximation is \nsufficient. \n4 The two-dimensional model \nAlthough the spatial pattern formation potential of the mechanical model in \none-dimension has been widely investigated, see, for example, Perelson et al. \n[19], Murray et al. [14], Bentil [1] and the book by Grindrod [5], the analysis \nof two-dimensional spatial and spatio-temporal patterns generated by the \nmechanical model is still lacking. \nHere, we extend the one-dimensional linear analysis to cover the two- \ndimensional case and present some numerical simulations which illustrate the \nspatio-temporal pattern formation potential of the two-dimensional model. \nWe choose the obvious extension of the one-dimensional boundary condi- \ntions for the cell and ECM densities and use Proposition 2.1 to determine the \nboundary conditions for the components of the two-dimensional displace- \nment. \n4.1 Linear analysis and numerical simulation \nThe two-dimensional model in component form has four equations: two \ndefining the cell and ECM densities and two defining the displacements in the \nx- and y- directions.

Here, ),(K 2) measures the temporal growth of the disturbance with \nwavenumber K = [k[, where k = (k, l). Substituting (48) into the linear system, \nthe solvability condition gives a polynomial equation for ~,(K 2) which, after \nsome algebra, simplifies to \n2P1 (K 2, 2){a(K2)22 + b(K2)2 + d(K2)} = 0 (49) \nwhere K 2 = k 2 + 12, a(K 2) = #K 2 and, \nb(K 2) = D#K 4 + (E + rl~ -- zl - -  \"~2)K 2 -k- s \nd(K 2) = (DK 2 + r) ((E - \"cl)K 2 + s) \neK 2 e lK 2 \nP1 (K 2, 4) = --T- + - -5 -  + s. \nThe dispersion relation (49) is simply that of the one-dimensional case (14) \nmultiplied by the extra factor P1 ( K2, 2) which gives a negative root for 2 and \nhence is negligible from a pattern formation viewpoint. Therefore the linear \nanalysis of Section 3.1 carries over to the two-dimensional case; that is, the \nsystem will exhibit a Hopf bifurcation at the point in the parameter space \nwhere \nSpatio-temporal p tterns in a mechanical model 503 \nand kc = ,,\/k 2 + 12 is the critical mode number for a wave vector k = (k,\/). We \nnote here that for solutions on the unit square satisfying the boundary \nconditions (45), a wave vector k is admissible if and only if \nk~ = Ikl 2 = x\/~D = (n2 + m2)7c2 (51) \n1 \nwhere m and n are positive integers that are not zero simultaneously. \nHere, we consider the numerical simulation of the full system in the \ntwo-dimensional case using a finite difference numerical scheme and the \ninformation from this linear analysis. For the cell and ECM equations, \nstandard five-point formulae may be used, while for the two coupled equa- \ntions defining the displacement field, at least a nine-point difference formula is \nneeded to capture the essential feature of the system. The discrete quations \nare then solved by any appropriate method. Here, we employ an iterative \napproach using the SOR scheme (see Ngwa [16] for full details). To illustrate \na typical spatio-temporally oscillating solution we show the spatial profile of \nthe cell density c at selected times. The solution profile for p is similar to that \nof c and its spatial variation is made up of the appropriate eigenfunction given \nin (47). Since the vector u represents the displacement or deformation of the \nECM in such a way that a material point initially at position r in the ECM is \ndisplaced to position r + u, we also depict the typical displacement field. \nExample. The parameter set \n#=0.01,  E=10.0,  D=0.01,  s=99.747, ~=0.125, r=0.25 (52) \ngives zc = 6.743 and the wave number k~ = 32z 2 which corresponds to the \nwave vector (k, l) = (47z, 4r 0. Accordingly, the uniform steady state is linearly \nunstable to the eigenfunction c = cos(4nx)cos(4rcy) which dominates the \nnonlinear solution. Here, for z = 6.744, 2 = 0.004 + i12.136. See Figs. 1 and 2. \nIn the above example the initial data are chosen as random perturbations \nabout the uniform steady state cell density c = 1 using the NAG routing \nG05CAF. The ECM density p and displacements U and W were left unper- \nturbed at their steady state values. \n5 Alternative view of the two-dimensional model \nThe linear analysis of Section 4.1 shows that the dispersion relation in the \ntwo-dimensional case can be factorized into the form (49) where the roots with \npositive real part must satisfy the one-dimensional dispersion relation. Here \nwe present an equivalent formulation of the model equations using the fact \nthat every vector field Vcan be decomposed into two parts: a divergence free \nrotational part and an irrotational part, and show that if we decompose the \ndisplacement field in our model in this way, then the rotational part decays to \nzero for large times and hence does not contribute to the pattern forming \npotential of the model. Hence, if we discard the rotational part of the vector \n504 G. A\u00b0 Ngwa, P. K.

From (59), using (61), we verify that \nV.p -- 0 in f2 andp.  n = 0 on F and that the linearization about the uniform \nsteady state c -- p -- 1, q~ -- ~k -- 0 gives the spatial eigenfunction of the lin- \nearized version of (56) as \n(c, p) oc (cos (krcx) cos (lrcy), cos (krcx) cos (lrcy)) \n(~b, 0) oc (cos (krcx) cos (Ircy), sin (krcx) sin(\/ny)) J (62) \nwhere k and l are integers. The relation u = V~b + p then gives the spatial \neigenfunctions for u in the form u oc (sin(kx)cos(ly), cos(kx)sin(\/y)). Since the \neigenfunctions agree with (47), the solution of the linearized system here may \ndiffer from that of the original model (53) only by an arbitrary constant. \nThe linear growth rate of the decomposed equations i identical to that of \nthe original partial differential equation. This can be verified as follows: put \n= A(t)~ in (60) to obtain the equation \nk+ dA elk+ A _ skzA = O o (63) \n2 dt 2 \nHence A(t) oc exp(2t) where 2 satisfies ctk22 + e~k 2 + 2s = 0 and is precisely \nthe factor P~ (k 2, 2) given in (49). Therefore A(t) will decay to zero, as t ~ oo. \nHence we shall set p = 0 in the new formulation (56). \nSpatio-temporal patterns in a mechanical model 507, \n5.2 The biharmonic equation formulation \nTaking the divergence of the second of (56) yields the equation \n#V4t~t + EV4~b + V2(p'~(c, z)) - sV.(pVt~) = 0, (64) \nClearly, (64) requires two boundary conditions on \u00a2 since it is of fourth order. \nTo determine this extra condition, we consider the matrix conservation \nequation, linearize about the steady state p = 1, \u00a2 = 0 and integrate in time to \nhave the linear solution p = 1 - V2\u00a2. Hence, \n~p 0V:\u00a2 \n~-~=0onF  =~ ~n =0 onF  (65) \nis the extra boundary condition needed. \nWe can linearize about the uniform steady state p = c = 1, \u00a2 = 0 and \neasily verify that the eigenfunctions of the linear system are of the \nform (c, p, \u00a2 )= A cos(kx)cos(ly) where k and \/integer multiples of ~z. We \ncan also show that a solution of the linear system of the form \n(c,p, \u00a2) =Aexp(2t)cos(kx)cos(ly) eads to a dispersion relation for the \ngrowth rate 2 which agrees with the factorized two-dimensional dispersion \nrelation (49). Thus the results from that section carry over. \n5.3 Constant matrix formulation \nHere we consider a version of the model where we set the matrix density p to \nbe constant, normalized at unity (Murray, 1989 1-15]). This simplifies the \nmodel greatly and it now takes the form \nct - DV2c + V.

Hence, the growth rate 2 satisfies the quadratic \n+ (DK 2 + r)(EK 2 + s) = 0. (69) \nHere, for ~ < 1, if z __< 0 then the uniform steady state is stable to small \nperturbations. As z increases from zero, the coefficient of 2 can become \nnegative and the real part of 2 can become positive leading to linear instabil- \nity. In this case, the uniform steady state first loses linear stability at a critical \nwave number k~ and a critical coupling parameter %given by \n(E+#r+2 ~x\/ \/~) ( l+~)2  \nk~= s and zc= 1 -~ ' < 1 (70) o \nAgain 2(k~, zc) = + i~o and we have a Hopf bifurcation. We note that on the \nunit square, given the boundary conditions Vc.n = Vq~.n = 0 on F, kc is \ndiscrete and is such that k~ z = (n2~ 2+ m2~ z) where m and n are the mode \nnumbers, hereafter referred to as a mode pair. Since our domain ~ is a square, \nand the wave number depends only on Ikl, different combinations of m and \nn will give rise to the same transverse wave number kc and a multimodal \ninteraction may be observed. When this occurs, we say that the mode pair \n(m, n) is deoenerate; that is, there are several pairs of integers (m, n) correspond- \ning to the same k~ for which (51) will hold. For the given parameters\/~, D and \ns for which k~ = sx \/~,  let the number Q = k2c\/r~ 2 be an integer. Then, we \nseek integers m and n for which (51) is satisfied. Clearly for certain values of Q, \nthere will be more than one admissible mode pair. For example, Q = 5, then \n5 = 12 + 22 = 22 + 12 and we have two mode pairs (1, 2) and (2, 1). If Q = 50, \nwe have 50 = 52 + 52 = 12 + 72 = 72 + 12 giving three pairs (5, 5), (7, 1) and \n(1, 7). Each of these satisfy (51) and, by (69), will each have the same initial \ngrowth rate 2. In general, suppose that for a given Q there are N admissible \nmode pairs, then the resulting solution to the linear problem will be linear \ncombination of all N-pairs. Next, we investigate the modal interactions that \narise when the wave number with positive growth rate has two or more mode \npairs. \n6 Analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in 2-D \nFrom the previous ection, the most general solution of the linearized system \nat the bifurcation point (k~, \"co) may be represented asa linear combination of \nall the possible N-pairs, (k j, l j), j = 1, 2, ..., N for all j such that k~ = k~ + l~. \nHence, at bifurcation, \n= ~ (Aj exp (io~t) cos (kjx) cos (ljy) + cc) (71) \nJ \nSpatio-temporal patterns in a mechanical model 509 \nwhere, as usual, cc represents complex conjugate, Here, we investigate he long \ntime behaviour of this solution when nonlinear effects are taken into account. \n6.1 Two-dimensional degenerate mode interaction \nSuppose we perturb the bifurcation parameter z by writing ~ = ~\u00a2 + eEv, \nv = _ 1. Then, the system (67) is modified appropriately and the temporal \ngrowth rate 2 becomes \n2(k~, ~c + ~2v) = + ico + \n(1 - \u00a2) \n2#(1 + 0 2 \nezv + 0(~4). (72) \nHence, the initial growth rate of the perturbed system is \nexp(l - OeZvt\/2(1 +\u00a2)2#), a real and positive term. As before, we introduce \na long time scale T = ~zt and consider the two time regimes, t and T as in \nSection 3.2, equation (22). Next we expand each of the variables in a power \nseries about the steady state by writing \n49= ~ dO,,. c=1+ Z dc. g(t)=go+ ~ dgi (73) \ni=1 i=I i=l \nwhere ~bi, ci and 0i are functions of x, y, t and T.

Substituting these expansions into the system (67) and \nequating powers of e gives the hierarchical set of equations \nL \u00a2i = Ri (76) \nwhere L is a linear operator of the form \nDV 2 + r \nL = (77) \n(1, ~c) \nV 2 __&0 ~) \n#V 2 ~ + EV E - s I \n\/ \nthat acts on the column vector (q, c~i) r.\n510 G.A.

In general, for each \npower of e, we have a non-homogeneous partial differential equation system \nwith homogeneous boundary conditions. \n6.2 The amplitude quations \nWe proceed to solve each equation in turn: since the eigenvalue 2(k z, ~) is \nmultiple in the sense described above, a separated solu ion of the form (71) \nsatisfies the boundary conditions and thus is the general solution of the linear \nsystem at the bifurcation point. At O(~), gl (t, T) = 0 and the equation set is \nidentical to the linear system as expected. Apart from the implementation f \nthe integral constraint, he solution procedure here follows step by step in \na similar fashion to the one-dimensional c se. That is, at 0(~2), secular terms \ndo not arise in the solution. At O(~3), secular terms arise andare suppressed \nSpatio-temporal p tterns in a mechanical model 511 \nusing the solvability conditions imposed by the Fredholm alternative the- \norem. This then gives rise to the amplitude quation which we state in the \ngeneral form \n1 e q q dAq 1 N ~ N \nj= l  m=l  n=l  \n+ \"-'2c=J\"'\"'qA~j~,,~,% \"~ + GJ3 ..... q.~jAmA,) = 0 (81) \nfor each q, where the quantities G~ ..... q = Gi(+kj, +_kin, +_k,, +_kq), i = 1, 2, \n3, j, m, n; q = 1, 2, ..., N are functions of the wave numbers and the critical \ntraction parameter -C~o These terms arise from consideration of combinations \no f (+ k j, + k~, +_ k,, +_ kq) for which kj +km + kn + kq = 0 which are precisely \nthe secular terms in the system at O(ea). Equation (81) defines the first order \namplitude functions Aq, q = 1, ..., N. It shows how the growth rate of a solu- \ntion characterized by the mode pair (kq, lq) interacts with all the other mode \npairs with the same wave number. \nWhen N = 1, (81) collapses to the single equation that can be rearranged \nto give \ndAq \ndZ + aqAq + flqA2q.~q = 0. (82) \nThis is similar to equation (34) which governs the amplitude in the one- \ndimensional case discussed in Section 3. Hence, the results from that section \ncarry over. \n6.3 Bimodal solutions \nIn contrast to the case N = 1, the corresponding analysis for N > 2 is \nconsiderably complicated owing to the presence of conjugate terms in (81) \nwhich precludes the kind of amplitude\/phase d coupling which occurs in the \ncase N = 1. When N = 2, the mode pairs (k, l) are such that kx = 12, kz = 11 \nand the general system (81) reduces to a pair of complex equations for the \ncomplex amplitudes At, i = 1, 2 of the form \ndAx \nd--T\" + ~oAt + ~IA~A1 + ~2AxA2A2 + aaA~\/il = 0 \ndA2 (83) \nd--T + ~oA2 +\/~IALL +\/~2A1A2,~l + #3A~L = 0 \nwhere ~i and fli, i = 0, 1, 2, 3 are functions of the wave numbers kj, j = 1, 2 \nobtained from the evaluation of G j ..... q, i = 1, 2, 3 at (kj, kin, k,, kq). \nThe interaction between the two mode pairs manifests itself in the presence \nof terms of the form AIA2A2 in the complex amplitude quation (83).

(87) \n6,4 Linear stability analysis for bimodal solutions \nLet the steady state (time independent) solutions of (85) be represented by R \u00b0, \nwith associated phases 0 \u00b0, i=  1, 2. The trivial solution R \u00b0 = 0 is always \nunstable (stable) when a~v and fl~v are both less (greater) than zero, for the \nstability of this steady state is governed by the linearized version of (85), \nnamely \nd\/~l dR2 \nd--T + a~v\/~l = 0, -~  + fl'ovR2 = 0 (88) \nwhere R~ ,~ 1, i = 1, 2 is a perturbation from the trivial steady state. Thus, the \nstability of the uniform steady state of the original partial differential equation \nsystem is also determined by ~v and fl~v. Accordingly, we expect ~v  = fl~v \nand this is easily verified by calculating the coefficient of the linear term in the \namplitude equation and comparing with (72) which will also show that \n~OV i = floVo In addition to the trivial solution R \u00b0 = O, two other steady state \nsolutions for the real amplitudes R~ with an associated phase O~ are \nSpatio-temporal patterns in a mechanical model 513 \nidentified (cf Magolis [123): \nI (Ia) R \u00b0=0,  (R\u00b0) 2 -  -eLY \n(Ib) R \u00b0=0,  (R\u00b0) 2= - f l~v  \nfll \n} ---71 > o, h-Y + ~'o~ + ~i(R\u00b0) ~ = 0 d0 o \n- ->0,  ~+f l~v+f l i (R\u00b0 )  2=0 \nII (R\u00b0) 2 = fl]~\u00a2i -- fl~,2a~,~ > 0, (R\u00b0) 2 = \ntogether with the associated phases (case II) \nd0 \u00b0 . . \ndT + u~v + col(R\u00b0) 2 + c\u00a22,~(Oo)(R\u00b0) 2 = 0 \nd0\u00b0 i o 2 \nd---T + fl~v + fl](R\u00b0) 2 + fl2, i(Oo)(R1) = 0 \n(89) \n> o (9o) r r r r \nwhere Oo, the steady state phase difference, is defined for non-zero R \u00b0 and \nR \u00b0 by the equation \ni 02  i 02  fl'ov ='or + fl'~(IC\u00b0Y =~(R\u00b0) ~ + fl~,~(Oo)(R~) o.  - - - e2,1(Oo)(R2) = (91) \nThe inequalities in (89) and (90), which are necessary conditions for the given \nsolutions to exist, determine whether bifurcations are supercritical or subcriti- \ncal. The steady state phase difference O0 is determined from (91) as follows: set \nx = cos(2Oo), y = sin(2Oo) so that x 2 + y2 = 1 and substitute the non-zero \nreal amplitudes R\u00b0 and R \u00b0 into (91) to get \nCo + cax + czy + %xy + C4 X2 + cSy 2 = 0, X 2 + y2 = 1 (92) \nwhere \nr r i r r i r i \" c3 2(~f l~+~3f l~) ,  c, ~3fl3 c5 = = ~3f l~  - f l~  \nThe conic section given in (92) intersects the circle x 2 + y2 = 1 in at most four \npoints and each of these four points represents he solution for the steady state \nphase difference Oo. For a given 00, admissible solutions are those for which \nR \u00b0, j = 1, 2, are positive. \nWe now analyse the single mode solution branches (89) for linear stability. \nConsider first the branch I(a): a small perturbation\/~l away from the steady \nstate R \u00b0 satisfies the first order equation \nd\/~l 2~v\/~1 = 0, d0\u00b0 \ndT ~ + 2~(R\u00b0) 2 = 0o \nFrom the preceding section, we conclude that if -a~v > 0 (<0) along this \nbranch then the bifurcation is supercritical (subcritical). However for a \n514 G.A. Ngwa, P, K. Maini \nsupercritical ( -0~v > 0) solution to be stable, it must be stable also with \nrespect o the perturbation\/~2 from the steady state R \u00b0 = 0, which for\/~2 ~ 1 \nis determined by the solution of \nd~2 \n+ {flroV + (fir2. +l f l3  [ C\u00b0s(z))(R\u00b0)2}\/~2 = 0 (93) \ndT \nwhere X = 202 - Arg(fla) - 200 is determined as follows: consider the corres- \nponding phase equation for 02 given by (86). Since R \u00b0 = 0, a corresponding 0 \u00b0 \nis not determined and thus there is no a priori reason to place any smallness \ncondition on the phase angle 02 associated with the complex perturbation \n\/~2exp(i02). Therefore, we consider the small perturbations 0~,\/~1 and \n\/~2 away from the quantities 0 \u00b0, R \u00b0 and R \u00b0 in the phase equation for 02 and \ntake only first order terms in \/~,  0~ and\/~2 to have the nonlinear equation \nd02 \n\/~2-~- + fl~v\/~2 + [fig + fl~ cos(202 - 20 \u00b0) \n-- fl~ sin(202 - 20\u00b0)] (R\u00b0)2\/~ 2 = 0.  \nFor  small but non-zero \/~2, if we set X = 202-  200 -Arg(~a)  then Z is \ndetermined by the nonlinear equation \ndx \nd-T - 21fla I(R\u00b0) 2 sin(x) = -2( f l~ - ~) (R\u00b0 )  2 . (94) \nNow X has equil ibrium points at \nsin(z) = - -  (95) \nI\/~31 \nwhich exist when I\/~-~1__<1\/~31. For notational simplicity, we set \na = 2lflal (R\u00b0) 2 and b = 2(fl~ - el)(R\u00b0) 2 and establish that (94) has a general \nsolution defined for any constant x by \nI a  (bc )  a 2 ~. -~ (i) ~ + ctan - T ; ]bl > a; c 2 = 1 - ~ e > 0 \ntan Z = (ii) ~_a--~-- ~ +1; b= ++_a (96) \n(iii) -~ + ctanh T - ~ ; Ibl < a; - c  2 = 1 - b~, c > 0 .  \nThe solution (96) shows that when Ibl < a, Z will tend to one of the equilib- \nrium points given by (95) as T ~ oo. In this case, X(oo) is a constant and hence \ncos(z(oo)) is determined. Therefore from (93) we have \n- \\ff\u00b0v~t'le, -e'\u00b0vff2) T ['3'~\u00b0V frc\u00b0s(z(x)) o (97) log(\/~2) = \nSince CdoV=fl~oV, we have that if -fl~oV\/e~ >0 and, in addition, \nfl~ - 0t~ < I fla I, in which case Z will tend to one of its equilibrium points, then \nSpatio-temporal p tterns in a mechanical model 515 \n\/~2 will grow (decay) depending on whether \n~] - fll ~ [f131 1 - f-fl~--- > 0(<0).  (98) \n\\ t\/hi \nOn the other hand, if ]fl~ - a~l > I\/hi, the situation is quite different. In the \nnotation of the general solution (96), this is the case (i). Here, \u2022 is periodic and \nhence the perturbation\/~2 will be periodic. Careful consideration fthe case (i) \nin (96), shows that \ncsin(2x + ~co - beT) \ncos (z(T)) = \na \n1 + ~ cos(2t\u00a2 + Xo - bcT) \nfT  1 { a } => cos(;~(T))dT =- log  1 + cos(2x + ~o - beT) + x 1 \na \nwhere tan(xo) = bc\/a, ~1 is a constant of integration and a, b and c are defined \nas in (96). Using the last expression i  (97), together with a = 2 [fla[ (R\u00b0) 2 and \n\u2022 ~v = fl~v, gives the solution for\/~2 \n{a ? ( \"  ) \/~2=xi  l+~cos(2x+Ko-bcr )  exp - -~- i  te l - f l~)T  . (99) \nHence, if -fl~v\/e~ > 0, then \/~2 will grow (decay) if e~ - fl~ > 0 (< 0). \nTherefore, whether X is oscillatory or not, the stability of the perturbed \nequation (93) depends crucially on the sign of a~ - fl~. From (99), referring to \n(98), we deduce that the oscillations in )~ do not alter the stability conditions \nsignificantly. \nIn summary the stability of the solution branch I(a) depends crucially on \nthe sign of a~ - fl~. For fl~v = ~v < 0, if e~ is positive, then the single mode \nsolution branch I(a) is always unstable when a] - fl~ > 0 and stable other- \nwise. If e~ is negative, the reverse of the inequality holds. The stability analysis \nof the solution branch I(b) is analogous. \nThe linear stability analysis of the type II solutions is straightforward \nbecause 0F and 02 \u00b0 are known. Therefore, defining the small perturbations \n\/~i R i R\u00b0and05 Oj o \u2022 = - ^ = - O j ,  j = 1, 2, so that the phase difference also has \na perturbation 0 = 0 - 0o, the growth or decay of the solutions is deter- \nmined by the eigenvalues of the matrix of the linearized system which may be \nwritten in the form \ndr \nd---T + Br = 0 (100) \nwhere r=( \/~1, \/~2,0)  T and B the Jacobian matrix evaluated at \nR \u00b0, i = 1, 2, O \u00b0. We look for solutions of (100) of the form r = to exp(aT) and \nthe solvability condition is [aI + B[ = 0. In this case, the analysis is straight- \nforward and will be omitted. We show, by means of an example (see Table 1), \nthe existence of stable solutions of type II and present numerical simulations \nof the amplitude quations for some parameter values (see Figs. 3 and 4). \n516 G.A.

The corresponding (9 is shown in Fig. 5. \nThe above analysis indicates that bimodal solutions of type II arise as \na result of a primary bifurcation from the trivial solution (0, 0). When non- \nzero time independent amplitudes R \u00b0 and R \u00b0 exist, the primary bifurcation to \nthese solutions is supercritical and occurs at the point where ~v = 0. The \nanalysis also indicates that the type II bimodal solution branch and the types \nI(a, b) single mode solution branches cannot co-exist simultaneously. When- \never the solution falls on any of the branches l(a) or l(b), a secondary \nbifurcation occurs and the solution will return on the solution branch II. The \nresult is a time periodic solution with the perturbed frequency on the t-scale \ngiven by \n2re 2re \n+ 01(~2t),  - -  + 02(~2t) (103) \no,) o)  \nwhich are initially the same (see, for example, 1-20], EIO]). \nTo end this section, we remark that when the eigenvalues of the linearized \nJacobian matrix are complex, multiple periodic (quasi-periodic) solutions will \narise as higher order bifurcations from the pure mode solutions I(a, b) and \nthe mixed mode solutions II. We note, however, that here, for the case \nN = 2, kl = 12, kz = 11 and the coefficients ~, ]~, i = O, 1, 2, 3 are such that \nonly time periodic solutions of type II arise. \n7 Discussion \nIn this paper, we have analysed spatio-temporal patterns for a mechanical \nmodel both in one- and two-dimensions. In our analyses, our ultimate goal \nSpatio-temporal p tterns ina mechanical model 519 \nhas been to calculate the amplitude function that governs the spatio-temporal \nbehaviour of the solutions for large time. \nIn the one-dimensional analysis, we have considered only cases where the \nuniform steady state is unstable to a solution with one mode number. The \nproblem of bifurcations to solutions involving more that one mode number in \nthe linear regime is a more complicated one and is still under investigation. I  \nthe one-dimensional c se, we gave a detailed nonlinear analysis of the full \nnonlinear system and determined the leading order approximation to the \namplitude function. \nFor the two-dimensional c se, we presented an alternative r formulation \nof the two-dimensional model and justified it by showing that its underlying \nsolutions agree with those of the original model. We explored the notion of \nmode degeneracy in the linear analysis of the system: that is, we considered the \ncase where two or more mode pairs, associated with the same transverse wave \nnumber on a square domain, have the same growth rate in the linear egime. \nWe further presented a detailed nonlinear analysis of spatio-temporal degen- \nerate mode interaction. Our analysis has shown that, for the non-degenerate \ncase, the behaviour of the system isa natural extension of the one-dimensional \nsingle mode solution. For the case where there are two degenerate mode pairs, \na preliminary investigation showed that there are four possible time indepen- \ndent solutions for the amplitudes associated with each mode pair: the trivial \nsolution, two single mode solutions (types I(a,) and I(b)) and a bimodal \nsolution (type II). A further analysis howed that the only stable solution is the \nbimodal solution whereby the amplitude functions associated with each of the \ndegenerate mode pairs are in a frequency locked oscillation. In this case, the \nsolution of the full nonlinear system near the bifurcation point will be made up \nof some proportions of the eigenfunctions a sociated with those degenerate \nmodes. This was verified by a numerical example. Although we only presented \nresults for a single parameter set, we have considered several parameter sets \nand have verified in each case that the numerical solutions to the full model \nagree with the analytic solutions derived. \nFrom our analysis on the simplified model, and for the parameter values \nwe have used in the examples considered, we have not been able to locate any \nother stable solutions, aside from the bimodal solution of type II. We have no \nreason, however, to believe that in an analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in \nthe full mechanochemical model, the situation will remain the same. \nWe remark that, to date, we do not know whether spatio-temporal \npatterns have any direct applications in the context in which the \nmechanochemical model was developed, namely embryonic development. \nHowever, the protrusive and regressive behaviour of cellular filopodia has \nbeen modelled as a spatio-tcmporal phenomenon (Lewis and Murray [9]). \nMoreover, spatio-temporal patterns abound in many biological and chemical \nsystems. In this paper, we have shown how the mechanical model can be \nreduced by the Helmholtz decomposition to a much simpler sub-model and \nwe have presented a framework for analysing spatio-temporal patterns and \nmode interactions within that system. \n520 G.A.
