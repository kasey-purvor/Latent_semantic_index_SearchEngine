GLISTER*\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTHE facts of Barclays Bank Ltd. v. Quistclose Investments Ltd. are\nwell-known.1 In July 1964 Rolls Razor Ltd. declared a dividend\npayment that they were unable to meet. In order to meet their\nobligation, the company arranged to borrow the amount of the\ndividend, \u00a3210,000, from Quistclose Investments. The money was\nduly transferred into a separate account of Rolls Razor, opened\nspecially for the purpose, held at Barclays Bank. The dividend was\npayable on 24 July but had not been paid when, on 27 August,\nRolls Razor entered voluntary liquidation. Barclays and Quistclose\nboth claimed the money. Barclays asserted a right of set-off against\nthe Rolls Razor overdraft, while Quistclose claimed that the money\nwas held in trust for them and, since Barclays were aware of this,\nthe bank were accordingly constructive trustees of the funds.\nQuistclose won. A unanimous House of Lords agreed that the\nfunds were held in trust and that Barclays had the necessary notice\nof the arrangement. However, several issues were left open. Firstly,\nLord Wilberforce referred to a \u2018\u2018primary\u2019\u2019 trust for the creditors,\nand a \u2018\u2018secondary\u2019\u2019 trust for the lender, yet the mechanics and\nnature of these trusts were not explored. Lord Wilberforce never\ncategorised the \u2018\u2018secondary\u2019\u2019 trust as express, resulting or\nconstructive, nor did he comment on the issue of enforcement of\nthe \u2018\u2018primary\u2019\u2019 trust. Secondly, the scope of the Quistclose analysis\nwas not defined. Quistclose itself involved an attempted financial\nrescue, as did the earlier cases that Lord Wilberforce approved.2\nDoes this mean that the analysis can only apply in such cases,3 or\n* Lecturer in Law, University of Durham. I would like to thank Janet Ulph and Professor Tom\nAllen for their helpful comments on earlier drafts. Any remaining errors are my own.\n1 Barclays Bank Ltd. v. Quistclose Investments Ltd. [1970] A.C. 567.\n2 Toovey v. Milne (1819) 2 B. & Ald. 683; Edwards v. Glyn (1859) 2 E. & E. 29; Re Rogers\n(1891) 8 Morr. 243; Re Drucker (No. 1) [1902] 2 K.B. 237.\n3 Discussing the line of cases prior to Quistclose, Swadling comments: \u2018\u2018they form an anomalous\nrule applicable only to the law of bankruptcy and, for that reason, cannot be applied outside\nthat context\u2019\u2019. W. Swadling, \u2018\u2018A New Role for Resulting Trusts?\u2019\u2019 (1996) 16 L.S. 110, p. 122.\nSee also Re Associated Securities [1981] 1 N.S.W.L.R. 742.\n632\nis the underlying principle that property transferred for a specific\npurpose will be held on trust?4\nThis paper is concerned with the categorisation of Quistclose\narrangements, an issue necessarily tied up with that of enforcement.\nCertain relationships, such as express trustee\/beneficiary, have\ncommon proprietary consequences.5 Thus the classification of a\ndevice as, for example, an express trust for a third party, would\nhave the corollary of allowing that person to enforce the trust.\nSimilarly, if parties did not label the transaction but contemplated\nthat the third party would have a right to enforce the trust, it\nmight be that the third party would be found to have a beneficial\ninterest. In this way classification is necessarily made by both legal\nprinciple and the parties\u2019 chosen allocation of rights and liabilities.\nHow one affects the other is a central thesis of this article.\nVarious commentators have argued that Quistclose arrangements\nshould properly be termed express, resulting or constructive trusts.6\nFurther, it has been argued that\u2014at least while the purpose is still\ncapable of fulfilment\u2014Quistclose trusts are in fact not trusts at all\nbut rather instances where both legal and beneficial title are held by\nthe borrower, with the transferor holding only an equitable right to\nrestrain the borrower\u2019s misuse of the funds.7 The various\npossibilities are discussed and criticised below. It will be argued that\nthese theories as to the nature of the Quistclose trust are not\nnecessarily mutually exclusive and that there is no single \u2018\u2018right\nanswer\u2019\u2019: the finding of an express trust in one Quistclose-type\nsituation would not preclude the finding of a resulting trust in\nanother. As mentioned above, classification and an analysis of the\nparties\u2019 agreement necessarily inform each other: depending on that\nagreement it may in any given situation be more appropriate to\ncategorise the relationship as that of express trust, resulting trust,\nor of no trust at all.\nSecurity for the lender\nIn Twinsectra v. Yardley, Lord Millett remarked in the context of\nQuistclose trusts that the \u2018\u2018whole purpose of the arrangements . . . is\nto prevent the money from passing to the borrower\u2019s trustee-in-\n4 As seems to be the correct view. See Twinsectra Ltd. v. Yardley and others [2002] UKHL 12,\n[2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [68] per Lord Millett: \u2018\u2018In the earlier cases the purpose was to enable the\nborrower to pay his creditors or some of them, but the principle is not limited to such cases.\u2019\u2019\n5 For example the right of absolutely-entitled, sui juris beneficiaries to terminate an express trust:\nSaunders v. Vautier (1841) 4 Beav. 115.\n6 Should the Quistclose trust not fit into one of these three categories a further option is that it\nshould be considered sui generis: see J. Payne, \u2018\u2018Quistclose and Resulting Trusts\u2019\u2019, in P. Birks &\nF. Rose (eds.), Restitution and Equity vol. 1 (London 2000), ch. 5. As will become apparent,\nthis author believes that Quistclose trusts are adequately served by the normal labels.\n7 R. Chambers, Resulting Trusts (Oxford 1997), ch. 3.\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 633\nbankruptcy in the event of his insolvency\u2019\u2019.8 That is, a \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019\nQuistclose trust is characterised by the transferor retaining some\nform of security over the property. It is, of course, possible for\nparties to construct an arrangement whereby A transfers property\nto B to enable B to pay C and A does not retain any security in\nthe advanced funds. It is not contended that such a transaction\nwould be invalid due to the lack of A\u2019s security, merely that the\nlack of security would prevent the arrangement from being termed\na Quistclose trust within the meaning of Lord Millett\u2019s analysis.\nCorrespondingly, the fact that a transferor holds security does\nnot automatically make the arrangement a Quistclose one: the\nsecurity may be held by way of charge, or the property may have\nbeen advanced subject to a retention of title clause. However, it is\nargued that a lack of security on A\u2019s part will make a Quistclose\nanalysis unavailable. It has already been mentioned that this would\nnot make the transaction invalid, so it may be thought that the\ndistinction is rather academic. As will become apparent it is used\nsimply as a way of distinguishing between those trust constructions\nwhere the beneficial interest is in A (\u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 Quistclose), and those\nwhere the equitable title is in C (still a trust, but not of the\nQuistclose type).\nII. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP IN C\u2014TRUST FOR THE THIRD PARTY\nIf A transfers money to B subject to the condition that it only be\nused to pay C, it could be that a trust for C is created whereby B\nis the trustee. That is, A\u2019s direction that B should use the money\nfor C may go beyond a vague intention to benefit and become an\nintention that C has the right to use and enjoy the benefit of that\nmoney.9 There is some support for this view that the beneficial\ninterest vests in the third party. In Quistclose itself Lord\nWilberforce said that \u2018\u2018arrangements of this character for the\npayment of a person\u2019s creditors by a third person, give rise to a\nrelationship of a fiduciary character or trust, in favour, as a\nprimary trust, of the creditors, and secondarily, if the primary trust\nfails, of the third person\u2019\u2019.10 Extra-judicially, Lord Millett has\nexpressed similar views. In 1985 he wrote: \u2018\u2018If A\u2019s intention was to\nbenefit C, or his object would be frustrated if he were to retain a\npower of revocation, the transaction will create an irrevocable trust\nin favour of C, enforceable by C but not by A. The beneficial\ninterest in the trust property will be in C.\u2019\u201911\n8 [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [82].\n9 See Paul v. Constance [1977] 1 W.L.R. 527.\n10 [1970] A.C. 567, 580.\n11 P.J. Millett, \u2018\u2018The Quistclose Trust: Who Can Enforce It?\u2019\u2019 (1985) 101 L.Q.R. 269, p. 290.\n634 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\nThe case of Hassall v. Smithers is also worth noting, although it\nmay ask as many questions as it answers.12 Funds were provided to\nenable the recipient to discharge certain debts he had incurred.\nHowever, the recipient soon died, intestate, without having satisfied\nthese debts. The provider of the funds brought a joint action with\nthe deceased\u2019s creditors and they were able to compel the\ndeceased\u2019s representative to pay off the debts. This could be seen as\nthe creditors (C) having a right to compel performance, which\nwould suggest that they were the beneficial owners. However, it\ncould also be argued that it was the action of the provider (A) that\nwas successful, as he had retained the beneficial interest\nthroughout.13\nOf course there is nothing abhorrent about the idea of A\ntransferring property to B, directing that it be held on trust for C.\nIn most cases this transfer will create a simple express trust with B\nholding as trustee for C and the settlor, A, dropping out of the\npicture as a stranger to the trust.14 However, there are some\nimportant considerations that must be addressed. Firstly, although\nthe model above assumes that A is the settlor, it could also be B.\nOn this construction B would borrow money from A to enable B\nto create a trust in favour of C: thus B settles the trust. If A\nintended that the money would end up in C\u2019s hands then the\nsituation is less clear: the beneficial interest may pass straight from\nA to C. However, it is suggested that the level of A\u2019s knowledge or\nintention must be carefully scrutinised to see whether it is sufficient\nto effect the creation of a trust. If it is, then A is the settlor and B\nonly ever receives legal title. However, it is more likely that A will\nrecognise and contemplate that C will gain the ultimate benefit of\nthe funds, but that this recognition will not be enough to show the\nrequisite certainty of intention to create a trust.\nThe identity of the settlor may be crucial if the deal involves tax\nconsiderations, or if the trust for C is settled shortly before B\u2019s\ninsolvency.15 The capacity of B to create trusts may be a further\n12 (1806) 12 Ves. 119.\n13 The Court did not answer this question: see L. Ho & P. St. J. Smart, \u2018\u2018Re-interpreting the\nQuistclose Trust: A Critique of Chambers\u2019 Analysis\u2019\u2019 (2001) 21 O.J.L.S. 267, p. 279.\n14 As Chambers points out, the transfer could also take effect as a secret (constructive) trust if\nthe transfer was part of a testamentary disposition that did not satisfy the requirements of the\nWills Act 1837: R. Chambers, \u2018\u2018Restrictions on the Use of Money\u2019\u2019 in W. Swadling (ed.), The\nQuistclose Trust: Critical Essays (Oxford 2004), ch. 5.\n15 There seem to be two possible lines of reasoning as to why such a device would not be a\npreference. In Re Kayford [1975] 1 W.L.R. 279, 281, it was thought that the question was not\none of preferring particular creditors, but rather of preventing donors of money from\nbecoming creditors (by making them beneficiaries instead). The case has been criticised on this\npoint, and the weakness is amply demonstrated by D. Waters in \u2018\u2018The Trust in the Setting of\nBusiness, Commerce and Bankruptcy\u2019\u2019 (1983) 21 Alberta L.R. 395, p. 417.\nAlternatively, following the distinction drawn by Millett J. in Re MC Bacon Ltd. [1990]\nB.C.L.C. 324, one could argue that whilst the debtor company may have intended to prefer\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 635\nissue. Much more importantly for our purposes, though, the\nidentity of the settlor tells us who receives the money in the event\nof the trust failing for uncertainty of objects. Should C be ill-\ndefined, extinct or otherwise unidentifiable then the beneficial\ninterest will revert to the settlor with B either holding on trust for\nA or obtaining full beneficial and legal title for himself.16\nA situation is therefore conceivable whereby A transfers money\nto B, contemplating that B will use it to benefit C. However, A\u2019s\ncontemplation, or indeed intention, is not sufficient to make her the\nsettlor of the trust: instead the money is transferred to B who\ndeclares herself trustee of it in favour of C. It then transpires that\nC does not exist and the beneficial interest reverts on resulting trust\nto B as the settlor. A will almost certainly have a contractual claim\nagainst B, as it is very likely that B has borrowed the money from\nA, but this will provide little security in an insolvency situation. It\nmay be possible to imply an intention that the beneficial interest\nshould revert to A in the event of C being unidentifiable. However,\nthis would be the equivalent of B declaring herself trustee in favour\nof A and would have the attendant problems regarding certainty of\nintention, preferences, and the capacity to create trusts.\nWe must also consider the mechanics of the trust whilst the\npurpose is still capable of fulfilment. Here the identity of the settlor\nis irrelevant: as long as the beneficial interest is vested in C it does\nnot matter whether A created the trust or B declared himself\ntrustee of money received from A. C is the beneficial owner while B\nholds legal title. B will owe fiduciary duties to C as trustee and\nmay also owe contractual duties to A, both in terms of repayment\nof the loan and of fulfilling the purpose for which the loan was\nmade.17 In Twinsectra Lords Millett and Hoffmann spoke of the\nrecipient (B) holding a power to apply the funds for the specified\npurpose,18 although at the time their Lordships were clearly\nthe creditor company, it did not necessarily desire to. That is, a declaration of trust would\nonly be vulnerable if there was a positive desire to improve the creditor\u2019s position, rather than\nsimply an appreciation of the necessity of such an act. This is a stronger ground on which to\ndeny a preference but it must be recognised, as the judge, Robert Wright QC, noted in Re\nBeacon Leisure Ltd. [1991] B.C.C. 213, that the distinction may be very small. In short, a\ndeclaration of trust in the run up to insolvency may still be vulnerable to claims that the\ndevice created a preference. See further G. McCormack, Proprietary Claims and Insolvency\n(London 1997), pp. 58\u201364.\n16 It is important to note that we are concerned here with a trust failing initially for uncertainty\nof objects, not subsequently because of B\u2019s supervening insolvency. In that circumstance the\nfunds will not be available for distribution amongst B\u2019s other creditors as the beneficial\nownership of those funds would already be in C.\n17 It is recognised that A obligating B by contract to benefit C could easily be construed as A\nintending the beneficial interest to pass straight to C. However, this does not conflict with the\nnotion of B owing contractual duties to A, and those duties replicating proprietary obligations\nthat B owes to C. (Note also, of course, the potential application of the Contracts (Rights of\nThird Parties) Act 1999.)\n18 [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [13]\u2013[16] per Lord Hoffmann, and at [101] per Lord Millett.\n636 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\ncontemplating the beneficial interest in the money to be in A.19 It is\nrather redundant to speak of B having a power to benefit C when\nC is the beneficial owner. As regards A, B may have a contractual\nduty to pay C. As regards C, B will be susceptible to C terminating\nthe trust.20\nProblems and Classification: is this a Quistclose trust?\nIt is not doubted that the beneficial interest could vest in C in a\ntransaction that appeared very similar to a Quistclose situation.\nHowever, it is argued that such a transaction should not properly\nbe termed a Quistclose trust. The very essence of such a device is\nthat it protects A\u2019s interests in the event of B\u2019s insolvency.21 It\ncould be argued that if A directed B to apply the funds to C, then\nA\u2019s interest would be adequately protected through the benefit\ngained by C: after all, this is what A desired in the first place. A\ncould also protect the investment de facto by taking security over\nsome of B\u2019s other assets. However, B may be incapable of giving\nsuch security, and it may be doubted whether such a course would\nbe a commercially realistic route for A to take. Other than these\nfrankly unsatisfactory suggestions, A\u2019s options\u2014and security\u2014\nwould be severely limited.\nUnder this construction the only right A could have to compel\nperformance would be contractual,22 and indeed this is also\nproblematic: what if B contracts with A to give the money to C in\nregular instalments, but C as beneficiary then directs B to give him\nall the money at once, terminating the trust? C could even\nterminate the trust and direct B to pay the money to someone\nelse.23 B has to comply with the wishes of his beneficiary, but in\ndoing so necessarily breaches his contract with A.24 The House of\nLords in Quistclose held that the lender actually has \u2018\u2018an equitable\nright to see that [the funds] are applied for the primary designated\npurpose\u2019\u2019.25 But how strong is this equitable right when facing the\n19 Lords Millett and Hoffmann may have disagreed over whether this was through the\nmechanism of an express trust or a resulting trust: see n. 62 below.\n20 C is an absolutely-entitled beneficiary and so may terminate the trust under the principle in\nSaunders v. Vautier (1841) 4 Beav. 115.\n21 See quotation cited above, n. 8.\n22 This may conflict with the decision in Hassall v. Smithers (1806) 12 Ves. 119, depending on\none\u2019s view of that case.\n23 Re Marshall [1914] 1 Ch. 192; Re Sandeman\u2019s WT [1937] 1 All E.R. 368.\n24 This would still be a problem even if C had agreed not to direct B in this way. C\u2019s\nproprietary rights \u2018\u2018trump\u2019\u2019 his contractual obligations. See J. Glister, \u2018\u2018Twinsectra v. Yardley:\nTrusts, Powers and Contractual Obligations\u2019\u2019 (2002) 16 Trust Law International 223, p. 228.\n25 \u2018\u2018Equitable\u2019\u2019 may refer to a personal right enforceable by injunction, or to a proprietary right.\nThe \u2018\u2018equitable\u2019\u2019 right of the lender in Chambers\u2019 thesis is of the former kind: see discussion\nbelow, nn. 37\u201341 and associated text. For the purposes of the current discussion the\ndistinction is irrelevant: the question is the strength of this right against the directions of an\nabsolutely-entitled beneficiary.\nC.L.J.

If C\u2019s interest is\nsubject to A\u2019s equitable right then it is difficult to see how C could\ntruly be the beneficial owner. If, on the other hand, C\u2019s beneficial\ninterest outweighs any equitable right of A then A\u2019s security is\nagain limited.\nMost importantly, though, if B becomes insolvent having\napplied half the funds for the agreed purpose, it is difficult to see\nhow the other half could revert to A. This would be necessary for\nA to have any security, and thus necessary for this \u2018\u2018trust for C\u2019\u2019\nconstruction to be a \u2018\u2018true\u2019\u2019 Quistclose trust. C has been the\nbeneficial owner of all the money since the start of the\narrangement,26 and at the time of B\u2019s insolvency C has been paid\u2014\nand thus acquired legal title to\u2014half of the money. The purpose\nhas been fulfilled as far as this half is concerned, whilst the other\nhalf is still owned by B on trust for C. How does A get it back?\nThis is the \u2018\u2018secondary\u2019\u2019 trust that Lord Wilberforce spoke about in\nQuistclose.27\nA cannot unilaterally remove C\u2019s beneficial interest in the\nmoney, and neither can B. The only way would be to either impute\nan unlikely intention to C that he transfers his equitable interest in\nthe remaining funds back to A, or to consider that C keeping the\ninterest in the remaining money would be unconscionable: also, it is\nsuggested, unlikely. It has been argued that a true Quistclose trust is\ncharacterised by the lender, A, retaining some form of security.28\nSuch an arrangement is not possible if the beneficial interest in the\ntransferred funds is taken to be in the creditor C.\nReturning to Lord Millett\u2019s extra-judicial writing, he asserts that\nif \u2018\u2018[A\u2019s] object would be frustrated if he were to retain a power of\nrevocation, the transaction will create an irrevocable trust in favour\nof C\u2019\u2019.29 Yet it would be a rare situation where A\u2019s object would be\nso frustrated: no doubt C would prefer it if A did not have a\npower of revocation, but A\u2019s foremost consideration will be the\nprotection of his own investment. Should this not be his foremost\nconsideration, A is always free to simply give the money to C or\nloan it to B without attempting any form of security. To\nsummarise; it is suggested that a trust for third parties of the kind\nthat Lord Millett envisaged, whilst of course conceivable, is not a\ntrue Quistclose-type trust. The trust for third parties encounters\nproblems when applied to insolvency situations and, whilst it is\nrecognised that Quistclose does not only apply here, it is suggested\n26 Whether the settlor was A or B.\n27 [1970] A.C. 567. See also discussion below, Section IV, of the trust being for A, whereupon\nthe distinction between primary and secondary trusts collapses.\n28 See above, n. 8, and associated text.\n29 Millett, \u2018\u2018The Quistclose Trust\u2019\u2019 (1985) 101 L.Q.R. 269, p. 290.\n638 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\nthat the use of a \u2018\u2018trust for C\u2019\u2019 construction would rather\nundermine the point of employing a Quistclose device in those\nsituations. Perhaps the point is better made from another angle:\nthat is, the lack of security for A\u2019s advance would undermine any\nattempt to argue that A had not intended the beneficial ownership\nto vest in C.\nIII. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP IN B\u2014NO TRUST\nIt is clear that if B borrows money from A the beneficial interest in\nthat money will normally be in B, with B owing A the money at\ncommon law under a contract of loan.30 This will be the case\nwhether or not B intends to pay C with the money. It will also be\nthe case if A knows that B intends to pay C. We are concerned\nwith the point at which A\u2019s knowledge and intentions regarding B\u2019s\nuse of the money alter the location of the beneficial interest in\nthose funds. When discussing the possibility of the beneficial\ninterest being in C it was argued that either A or B would need to\nshow the requisite certainty of intention to create a trust in favour\nof C.31 If the requisite certainty of intention to create a trust for C\nis not present then we must determine where the beneficial interest\nlies: A or B.\nIf A merely contemplates that B will use the funds for a specific\npurpose then B will receive unrestricted beneficial ownership.32 A\ngood illustration is the recent Australian case of Roxborough v.\nRothmans of Pall Mall Australia Ltd., where the appellants were\ntobacco retailers who bought cigarettes from Rothmans, a\nwholesaler.33 Tobacco wholesalers and retailers in New South Wales\nwere required to pay a licence fee to the State, but any products in\nrespect of which a fee had already been paid by the wholesaler\nwere disregarded in the calculation of the retailer\u2019s fee. Roxborough\nbought tobacco from Rothmans and was duly invoiced for the\nprice, with the amount due being expressly apportioned between the\n30 Strictly speaking, a person solely entitled to both legal and beneficial estates in property does\nnot have an equitable interest: the legal title carries with it all the rights. See Commissioner of\nStamp Duties (Queensland) v. Livingston [1965] A.C. 694, 712 per Viscount Radcliffe;\nVandervell v. I.R.C. [1967] 2 A.C. 291, 311 per Lord Upjohn; Westdeutsche Landesbank\nGirozentrale v. Islington L.B.C. [1996] A.C. 669, 706 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson. In this\ndiscussion the beneficial and legal title will normally be kept separate, for ease of expression,\neven when they vest in the same person. However, the issue does become important when\ndiscussing the possibility of A \u2018\u2018retaining\u2019\u2019 rather than \u2018\u2018obtaining\u2019\u2019 the equitable interest. See\ndiscussion below, nn. 68\u201373 and associated text.\n31 Depending on who is considered the settlor.\n32 In Re Osoba [1979] 2 All E.R. 393 a man left money to his wife on trust for his daughter\u2019s\n\u2018\u2018training up to university grade\u2019\u2019. It was held that the daughter took unrestricted ownership.\nSee also Re Bowes [1896] 1 Ch. 507 where a trust was expressed as being for the planting of\ntrees. It was held that the owners of the relevant estate took free of any trust, the tree\nplanting being considered as merely expressing a motive.\n33 (2001) 185 A.L.R. 335.\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 639\nactual cost of the cigarettes and the proportionate amount of the\nlicence fee. In effect, Rothmans passed on the fee to its retailers.\nThe licence fee was subsequently held to be constitutionally invalid\nby the High Court, but the retailers had already paid certain sums\nto Rothmans in anticipation of licence fees payable in the future.\nSince the invoices had specifically mentioned amounts payable as\nregards the licence fee, could the appellants claim that those sums\nof money now held by Rothmans were held on trust for them?34\nIn the High Court, Gleeson C.J., Gaudron and Hayne JJ.,\nfound that \u2018\u2018the tax component of the net total wholesale cost was\ntreated as a distinct and separate element by the parties\u2019\u2019.35 It could\nthus be argued that, given A\u2019s clear contemplation that the money\nbe applied for a specific purpose, B did not receive unrestricted\nbeneficial ownership. However, although the parties considered the\ntax money to be severable from the rest of the contract, it did not\nnecessarily follow that they also intended the further step of\nintending the beneficial interest in the tax money to remain in the\ndonor (or at least restricting the beneficial ownership of the\nwholesaler). As Gummow J. held: \u2018\u2018That is not to maintain that\nRothmans failed to acquire ownership in specie of the funds it was\npaid; nor does it mean that Rothmans was obliged to earmark and\nkeep those funds separate or otherwise treat them as if they were\nimpressed with trusts in favour of the appellants.\u2019\u201936\nIn that case the intention was not \u2018\u2018strong\u2019\u2019 enough to prevent B\nfrom receiving full ownership of the funds. What is required is a\nbinding condition that the relevant money will only be used for a\nspecific purpose. Simply put, if it had been contended that a\nQuistclose trust existed in Roxborough, the High Court could have\nsaid: \u2018\u2018it is accepted that the retailers paid a specific and severable\namount of money to Rothmans so that they could pay the licence\nfee; but we do not accept that the parties intended that that specific\nproperty itself should necessarily be the money applied\u2019\u2019.\nThe lender\u2019s right\u2014personal or proprietary?\nChambers argues that the existence of a binding condition need not\nnecessarily mean that the beneficial interest remains in A, but\n34 Interestingly, in the Full Federal Court the retailers had conceded that Rothmans had not\nreceived money on terms of a Quistclose trust. This was because there was no obligation to\nkeep the \u2018\u2018tax money\u2019\u2019 segregated. Bryan and Ellinghaus question the need for this concession\nin \u2018\u2018Fault Lines in the Law of Obligations: Roxborough v. Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia\nLtd.\u2019\u2019 (2000) 22 Sydney Law Review 636, p. 664, n. 101; and the current author has argued\nelswhere that a requirement of segregation is not necessarily determinative in these cases:\nGlister, \u2018\u2018Twinsectra v.

In acknowledging\nthat it does not fit into the accepted categories of proprietary rights\nto money,40 Chambers argues that we are dealing with a form of\npersonal right that developed in parallel with restrictive covenants\nin land and the De Mattos v. Gibson principle.41 In short, the\nQuistclose right is a personal right to money that should have, but\nnever did, make the transition into a proprietary right.\nAs mentioned above, the problem with A\u2019s right being merely\npersonal is that the level of security that that would afford is less\nthan if the right was of the proprietary kind.42 Under this\nconstruction once the purpose had failed A would become the\nbeneficiary of a resulting trust. However, A\u2019s position before the\ntrust fails may also be important, and it is unclear whether\nChambers\u2019 analysis adequately accounts for this situation. Not only\nis there the problem of A\u2019s right to restrain being a merely\ncontractual right; it may also be legitimately questioned whether\nQuistclose cases are indeed characterised by the lender\u2019s right to\nrestrain misuse rather than, at least in some cases, a right to\ncompel performance. In Gibert v. Gonard, North J. appeared to be\nmindful of a right to compel when he observed that \u2018\u2018if [a recipient]\nchooses to accept the money tendered for a particular purpose, it is\nhis duty, and there is a legal obligation on him, to apply it for that\npurpose\u2019\u2019.43 Similarly, in Hassall v. Smithers, Grant M.R. held that\nthe \u2018\u2018intestate was bound so to apply that remittance\u2019\u2019.44 Ho and\n37 Chambers, Resulting Trusts, pp. 73\u201378.\n38 Note that even if the right is purely personal A could still seek specific performance of B\u2019s\nobligations by injunction: Conservative and Unionist Central Office v. Burrell [1982] 2 All E.R.\n1.\n39 It might be that as soon as B misapplied any money the rest could revert to A on resulting\ntrust, because in those circumstances it was never intended that B should have full ownership.\nSee discussion below, n. 52. However, and in any case, a resulting trust construction involving\nthe remaining property does not account for the money that has already been misapplied.\nChambers, \u2018\u2018Restrictions on the Use of Money\u2019\u2019, in Swadling (ed.), The Quistclose Trust,\npoints out that this misapplied money would normally have disappeared anyway, either into\nthe hands of a bona fide purchaser or received by a innocent volunteer who has since changed\ntheir position. This may often be true, but not all the time and it is suggested that it would\nstill be clearly more beneficial to A to be able to exercise a proprietary right.\n40 Ownership, possession, a right of rescission and security interests.\n41 Chambers \u2018\u2018Restrictions on the Use of Money\u2019\u2019, pp. 94\u201397, discussing Tulk v. Moxhay (1848)\n41 E.R. 1143; De Mattos v. Gibson (1859) 45 E.R. 108.\n42 Neither would afford as much security as beneficial ownership, discussed below.\n43 (1884) 54 L.J. Ch. 439, 440.\n44 (1806) 12 Ves. 119, 121.\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 641\nSmart also point out that \u2018\u2018if counsel had asked the directors of the\nplaintiff in Quistclose whether it was intended that Rolls Razor\nmight sit on the money (for an indeterminate time) or, alternatively,\nthat Rolls Razor had (within a reasonable time) to use the money\nto pay off the dividend, one suspects an obvious reply would have\nbeen forthcoming\u2019\u2019.45\nAt least in some cases, it seems that B\u2019s application of the funds\nfor the specific purpose is obligatory, not permissive. That is, B is\nunder a positive obligation to apply the funds, not merely a\nnegative obligation to not misapply them. Ho and Smart contend\nthat Chambers\u2019 view is \u2018\u2018unavailable\u2019\u2019 in these cases involving\npositive obligations: the existence of a positive obligation would\nnecessarily mean that \u2018\u2018the \u2018entire beneficial ownership\u2019 of the\nmoney could scarcely be in the lender\u2019\u2019.46 This seems\nirreproachable, and received support from Lord Millett in\nTwinsectra.47 Lord Millett did not accept Chambers\u2019 opinions\nregarding the nature of the lender\u2019s right to restrain misuse:\nThe duty is not contractual but fiduciary. It may exist despite\nthe absence of any contract at all between the parties, as in\nRose v. Rose (1986) 7 NSWLR 679; and it binds third parties\nas in the Quistclose case itself. The duty is fiduciary in\ncharacter because a person who makes money available on\nterms that it is to be used for a particular purpose only and\nnot for any other purpose thereby places his trust and\nconfidence in the recipient to ensure that it is properly applied.\nThis is a classic situation in which a fiduciary relationship\narises, and since it arises in respect of a specific fund it gives\nrise to a trust.48\nReconciliation\nIn his recent piece on Quistclose, Chambers acknowledged that his\nmodel was not universally applicable, but maintained that the\nanalysis should still stand as a legal device that may be employed\nby parties who choose to do so.49 However, although the potential\nexistence on certain facts of a \u2018\u2018no-trust\u2019\u2019 construction can be\naccepted,50 it is argued that there is more to be said about the\nrelationship between the different models of Chambers and Millett.\n45 Ho and Smart \u2018\u2018Re-interpreting the Quistclose Trust\u2019\u2019 (2001) 21 O.J.L.S. 267, p. 278.\n46 Ibid. (footnote omitted).\n47 [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [95].\n48 [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [76]. For further discussion of fiduciary duties in this context see below,\nnn. 74\u201380 and associated text.\n49 Chambers, \u2018\u2018Restrictions on the Use of Money\u2019\u2019, p. 88. In his 1997 book Chambers had\nappeared to think that the two models were necessarily inconsistent: Resulting Trusts, p. 86.\n50 Chambers admitted that a resulting trust model \u2018\u2018may even be the most likely outcome when\na binding restriction on the use of money does not create an express trust\u2019\u2019: Chambers,\n\u2018\u2018Restrictions on the Use of Money\u2019\u2019.\n642 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\nWhat circumstances would give rise to one or the other, given that\nparties\u2019 express wishes may well be absent?51\nIt is suggested that it is necessary once more to separate positive\nand negative obligations. Lord Millett\u2019s words seem to suggest a\npositive duty, i.e. the fiduciary duty arises when A trusts that B will\nproperly apply the money; when A makes money available on\nterms that it is to be used for a particular purpose only. To\ndisregard these terms would be unconscionable. Chambers on the\nother hand is concerned with cases involving negative duties: where\nB may not spend the money on anything else, but is not actually\ncompelled to apply the money. It may seem a very narrow\ndistinction, but could it not be argued that it is the intention of the\nparties that B be compelled to apply the funds that is crucial? That\nis, if the parties agree that B will not use the money for anything\nother than C then no fiduciary relationship arises: if B misapplies\nthe money then A is left to his remedy in contract.52 However, if\nthey agree that B must spend the money on C then B becomes A\u2019s\nfiduciary. There is clearly a distinction between being compelled to\ndo something and merely being at liberty to do so: in this\ncircumstance it is suggested that the distinction determines where\nthe beneficial ownership in property lies.53\nChambers\u2019 model has also been criticised for being unable to\napply in instances where the transfer is not pursuant to a\ncontract.54 In this situation, so the argument goes, there would be\nno basis for a contractual right to prevent misuse, and so the duty\nmust be fiduciary. It is suggested that this is somewhat misleading:\nthe contract exists as evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions as to the\nbeneficial ownership of the funds. I have argued that if the contract\ncreates a positive duty on the part of the recipient, B, then that is\nindicative of an intention that B should not be the equitable owner.\n51 Express wishes might also by their existence result in another construction entirely: that of an\nexpress trust.\n52 A is left to this remedy for the money that has already been misapplied. Any remaining funds\nwill be held by A beneficially under a resulting trust: see above, n. 39. One consequence of\nthis analysis might appear surprising: following an initial misapplication this model would\nsuggest that any further application of property\u2014even precisely within the original\nagreement\u2014would be unlawful. This might seem unpalatable to innocent volunteers dealing\nwith trust property within the original purpose. Perhaps we could construct the resulting\ntrustee B as also holding a power to apply the funds to the original purpose: that is, although\nthe misapplication gave rise to a resulting trust, this is a matter of presumed intention and is\nnot the same as saying that the trust sprang up because the purpose had failed. Failure of\npurpose would give rise to a resulting trust, but that is not to say that only a failure of\npurpose may do so.\n53 Lord Millett, [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [76], stated that it would be \u2018\u2018unconscionable for a man to\nobtain money on terms as to its application and then disregard the terms on which he\nreceived it\u2019\u2019. It is suggested that this supports the suggested distinction: if B receives money\nunder a negative obligation, then as long as he does not misapply it he is not disregarding the\nterms on which he received those funds.\n54 See the comments of Lord Millett in Twinsectra v. Yardley [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [95], and\nthose of Ho and Smart, \u2018\u2018Re-interpreting the Quistclose Trust\u2019\u2019 (2001) 21 O.J.L.S. 267, p. 279.\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 643\nB has undertaken to apply the funds for a purpose, A has reposed\ntrust and confidence in B to this effect, and B is therefore A\u2019s\nfiduciary. If the agreement does not create a positive duty to apply\nthe money, then there is no fiduciary relationship. It so happens\nthat, in a case where this transfer was pursuant to a contract, A\nmay have a contractual right to prevent misuse. Yet Chambers\u2019\nmodel does not suggest that it automatically follows that voluntary\ntransfers cannot involve fiduciary relationships: it merely asserts\nthat there is no contract that can be used as evidence to determine\nwhether the parties intended a relationship that the law may\nclassify as fiduciary. Evidence must be sought from other means: a\nnon-contract transfer may or may not involve fiduciary duties on\nthe part of the recipient. The only difference is that where a non-\ncontract transfer does not involve fiduciary duties there will also\nnot be any contractual duties upon which the transferor could\nrely.55\nIV. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP IN A\u2014TRUST FOR THE LENDER\nIn 1985, Lord Millett proposed that under a Quistclose trust the\nbeneficial ownership of the transferred property might remain in the\nlender.56 This suggestion \u2018\u2018cleared away a lot of the fog\u2019\u201957 in the\nQuistclose area and was received with considerable academic and\njudicial favour.58 The construction has also been recently adopted\nby the House of Lords in Twinsectra v. Yardley.59 When A transfers\nfunds to B, B does not take them beneficially but instead holds the\nmoney on trust for A, under either an express trust or resulting\ntrust. B becomes the holder of a power to apply the funds for C,\nthe agreed purpose.60\n55 Again, as soon as some of the property is misapplied the rest of the funds will be held by the\ntransferor on resulting trust: above, n. 39 and 52.\n56 Millett, \u2018\u2018The Quistclose Trust\u2019\u2019 (1985) 101 L.Q.R. 269.\n57 The phrase is Chambers\u2019: Resulting Trusts, p. 74.\n58 See in particular M. Bridge, \u2018\u2018The Quistclose Trust in a World of Secured Transactions\u2019\u2019\n(1992) 12 O.J.L.S. 333, p. 352; and J. Priestley, \u2018\u2018The Romalpa Clause and the Quistclose\nTrust\u2019\u2019, in P.D. Finn (ed.) Equity and Commercial Relationships (Syndey 1987), ch. 8, p. 237.\nThe construction was also adopted by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in General\nCommunications Ltd. v. Development Finance Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. [1990] 3 N.Z.L.R.\n406, and was favourably considered by Gummow J. in the Australian Federal Court in Re\nAustralian Elizabethan Theatre Trust (1991) 102 A.L.R. 681.\n59 [2002] 2 A.C. 164.\n60 On the personal level B will almost certainly owe a contractual duty to A to apply the funds\nto C. As a matter of property law B holds on trust for A, but B also has a power to benefit\nC. That is, the parties\u2019 understanding that B must apply the funds to C provides the equitable\nbasis for the fiduciary power. Evidence of this understanding will almost always be in a\ncontract. However, if the intention that B should be compelled to apply the funds can be\nadduced from other sources then a \u2018\u2018trust for A\u2019\u2019 construction will still be available.\n644 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\nExpress trust for A\nThe lender, A, may hold the beneficial ownership of the transferred\nproperty as a beneficiary under either an express or resulting trust.\nUnder the former construction A transfers both legal and beneficial\ntitle to B who, immediately and pursuant to the contract, declares\nhimself trustee of those funds in favour of A. B will hold a power\nto apply the funds for the agreed purpose. This model has attracted\nacademic support,61 and seems to have been the basis upon which\nthe majority of the Lords found a trust in Twinsectra.62 Lord\nHoffmann made no mention of Quistclose trusts, but held that the\nmoney Sims had received from Twinsectra was indeed held in trust:\n\u2018\u2018The terms of the trust upon which Sims held the money must be\nfound in the undertaking which they gave to Twinsectra as a\ncondition of payment.\u2019\u201963 That is, the trust was an express trust\nwith the agreement between the parties containing the requisite\ncertainty of intention to the effect that Sims would hold that money\nin trust for Twinsectra.\nThere should be no objection to this. As long as the necessary\nintention to create a trust can be inferred from the parties\u2019\nagreement, there is no reason to deny them the relationship that\nthey objectively intended. One issue to consider, though, is the\nidentity of the settlor. In the model described above the settlor is B,\nas she declares herself trustee of the property (notwithstanding that\nshe is contractually obliged to do so). It could also be argued that\nA is the settlor and, as a result, never relinquished the beneficial\ninterest.64 This distinction is discussed more fully below.\nResulting trust for A\nA lender may also retain or acquire the beneficial interest in the\ntransferred funds through the mechanism of a resulting trust. Here\nthe legal title may pass from A to B, with the beneficial title\nremaining in A. Alternatively full ownership may pass but, since\nthe funds have not yet been applied to the purpose (and B was not\nintended to receive full beneficial ownership), the equitable interest\nimmediately jumps back to A on resulting trust. In either case B\n61 A. Speirs, \u2018\u2018Escape from the Tangled Web\u2019\u2019 [2002] 3 Web J.C.L.I.; C.E.F.

On the trust point Lord Millett held that a resulting\ntrust had been created, and Lord Hoffmann appeared to think it was an express trust. Lord\nSlynn agreed with Lord Hoffmann. Lord Steyn agreed with Lord Hoffmann and Lord\nHutton, who agreed with both Lord Hoffmann and Lord Millett.\n63 [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [12].\n64 This may be the better view of the facts in Twinsectra: see Rickett \u2018\u2018Quistclose Trusts and\nDishonest Assistance\u2019\u2019, p. 113.

Quistclose Trusts 645\nwill have a power to apply the funds for the specified purpose.\nLord Millett preferred a resulting trust model in Twinsectra:\nAs Sherlock Holmes reminded Dr. Watson, when you have\neliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however\nimprobable, must be the truth. I would reject all the alternative\nanalyses . . . and hold the Quistclose trust to be an entirely\northodox example of the kind of default trust known as a\nresulting trust. The lender pays the money to the borrower by\nway of loan, but he does not part with the entire beneficial\ninterest in the money, and insofar as he does not it is held on\na resulting trust for the lender from the outset.65\nResulting trusts arise \u2018\u2018whenever there is a transfer of property in\ncircumstances in which the transferor . . . did not intend to benefit\nthe recipient\u2019\u2019.66 That is, proof that the transferor intended to retain\nthe benefit of the property is not necessary: a resulting trust\nrequires only that the recipient was not intended to receive the full\nbeneficial interest. It is argued that this requirement is satisfied by\nthe recipient, B, being under a positive duty to apply the funds for\nthe stated purpose. Given this major restriction on B\u2019s use of the\nproperty, it could hardly be claimed that she was intended to have\nthe full benefit of the funds.67\nSingle transaction or grant and grant-back?\nBoth the express trust and resulting trust constructions involve B\nreceiving legal title and A holding the equitable interest. However,\nthere are two ways in which this end might be achieved: either the\nbeneficial interest remains in A throughout with only the legal title\nmoving, or full legal title is transferred and a grant-back is made of\nthe equitable estate.\nThere is authority to the effect that beneficial interests cannot be\n\u2018\u2018retained\u2019\u2019: in Re Bond Worth Ltd., Slade J. commented that the\ngrantor of a proprietary interest can only retain equitable interests\nwhich are in existence at the time of the grant.68 Given that a\nperson solely entitled to property has only a legal title, albeit one\nwhich carries with it equitable rights, it would seem impossible to\nretain beneficial ownership and the analysis must then be one of\n65 [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [100].\n66 This is the \u2018\u2018central thesis\u2019\u2019 of Chambers\u2019 book Resulting Trusts; quoted with approval by\nLord Millett in Twinsectra v. Yardley [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [92]. Note Penner\u2019s view that it\n\u2018\u2018would be unfortunate were the analytic clarification of the nature of Quistclose trusts to\ndepend upon the adoption of Chambers\u2019 thesis as to the nature of resulting trusts, as\nelaborated by Lord Millett, irrespective of how compelling some commentators find it\u2019\u2019: J.E.\nPenner, \u2018\u2018Lord Millett\u2019s Analysis\u2019\u2019 in Swadling, The Quistclose Trust, p. 52.\n67 It is argued above, text to n. 53, that the important distinction which determines the location\nof the equitable ownership is whether the restriction enables A to compel B to apply the\nfunds, or alternatively whether it merely enables A to restrain misuse.\n68 [1980] 1 Ch. 228, 253.\n646 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\n\u2018\u2018grant and grant-back\u2019\u2019.69 The House of Lords recently approved\nsuch a construction in Westdeutsche.70\nOn the other hand a \u2018\u2018single transaction\u2019\u2019 construction had been\nadopted in Abbey National Building Society v. Cann, a case decided\nonly five years earlier and also by the House of Lords.71 It may\nalso be legitimately questioned why it is possible to transfer an\ninterest but not to retain one. Further, as Worthington points out,\nwhen a resulting trust arises because of a voluntary transfer (rather\nthan on election to avoid a voidable contract) the correct view\nseems to be that the beneficial interest never left the donor.72 Of\ncourse, Quistclose trusts are very rarely voluntary transfers: almost\ninvariably the borrower will provide consideration for the advance.\nHowever, since the Quistclose analysis can be applied to a\nvoluntary transfer, it would seem strange to construe the\ntransactions differently.\nIt might be that this rather narrow distinction need not worry\nus unduly: with express trusts the genesis of the trust will be\ncontained within the same agreement as that which transfers the\nproperty, and similarly with a resulting trust model the transfer of\nfunds takes place at the same instant as the trust arises. Any\ndifficulties would only appear when and if the property became\nbeneficially that of B, for there would be a risk that the property\ncould be enveloped by another creditor\u2019s floating charge. If it is\naccepted that this could never happen, and that the grant and\ngrant-back necessarily occurred eo instanti, then in the context of a\ntrust for A it would not matter whether the correct analysis was\none of retention or acquisition of an equitable interest.73\nExpress trust or resulting trust?\nAt first sight it may also appear that it does not matter much\nwhether the device is taken to be an express or resulting trust: what\nis important is that the beneficial ownership of the property is in\nthe lender. However, there is reason to distinguish between the two:\n69 See R.M. Goode, Legal Problems of Credit and Security (3rd ed., London 2003), p. 21. See\nalso n. 30 above.\n70 [1996] A.C. 669.\n71 [1991] 1 A.C. 56.\n72 S. Worthington, Proprietary Interests in Commercial Transactions (Oxford 1996), p. x, referring\nto R. P. Meagher and W. M. C. Gummow, Jacob\u2019s Law of Trusts in Australia (5th ed, Sydney\n1986), p. 263: \u2018\u2018the property comes back to [the beneficiary] after it has been given away,\nalthough in truth the beneficial interest may never have left\u2019\u2019.\n73 The identity of the settlor would still be relevant in a \u2018\u2018trust for C\u2019\u2019 construction: if A\neffectively splits the estates and transfers the legal title to B at the same time as the equitable\ntitle vests in C then B can never acquire beneficial ownership. If, however, A transfers \u2018\u2018both\u2019\u2019\nestates to B, there may be a gap before B declares himself trustee of the property for C. It is\nthis gap which exposes the property to another creditor\u2019s floating charge and may expose the\nsubsequent declaration of trust to avoidance as a preference. See discussion above, n. 15 and\nassociated text.\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 647\nwhilst in either case A is an absolutely-entitled beneficiary, it is not\nnecessarily so clear that B\u2019s duties to A would be the same. As a\nbeneficiary under an express trust A would doubtless be able to\nterminate the trust and call for the property; but the law is not so\nclear on the position of beneficiaries under resulting trusts.74\nThe separation of legal and equitable ownership, while creating\na trust, does not necessarily create fiduciary relations:75 thus a\nresulting trust is not, ipso facto, a fiduciary arrangement. However,\nas Millett points out, \u2018\u2018the circumstances which give rise to it may\n. . . be sufficiently known to the trustee to subject him to such\nobligations\u2019\u2019.76 It is suggested that a Quistclose situation is one of\nthose instances where the trustee would be sufficiently aware of the\ntransferor\u2019s intention and motivation as to make him the subject of\nfiduciary duties.77 However, these duties need not be the same as\nthose owed by some conventional express trustees: in the United\nStates a resulting trust gives rise to some fiduciary obligations, at\nleast in relation to the trust property,78 but does not expose the\ntrustee to the same liabilities as an express trustee in English law.\nMillett argues that the same is true in this country: that is, while all\nfiduciaries are subject to fiduciary obligations, they are not all\nsubject to the same fiduciary obligations.79 It is thus argued that\nthe fiduciary duties owed by B to A could vary, depending on\nwhether A is the beneficiary under an express or resulting trust.80\nIf A transfers money to B and the parties agree that B is under\na positive duty to apply the funds for that purpose, then I have\nargued that B will not receive beneficial ownership. Rather, the\npositive contractual duty will mean that the proper construction in\nproperty law will involve A being beneficially entitled and B\n74 See Chambers, Resulting Trusts, pp. 196\u2013200; A.

As Frankfurter J. noted in S.E.C. v. Chenery Corp. (1943) 318\nUS 80, 85\u201386, \u2018\u2018to say that a man is a fiduciary only begins analysis . . . What obligations\ndoes he owe as a fiduciary?

This passage was quoted with\napproval by Lord Mustill in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd. [1995] 1 A.C. 74, 98.\n77 In the case of an express trust this could be shown by the contract containing the required\ncertainty of intention to create a trust. As regards resulting trusts it has been argued that the\nrecipient must be compelled to apply property to the purpose, and if the trustee is under such\na positive duty then we can impute knowledge as to her lender \/ beneficiary\u2019s intentions.\n78 Tricentrol Oil Trading Inc. v. Annesley (1991) 809 S.W. 2d. 218.\n79 Millett, \u2018\u2018Restitution and Constructive Trusts\u2019\u2019 (1998) 114 L.Q.R. 399, p. 403.

[1995] 2 A.C.\n145, 206.\n80 It might also be noted, recognising the commercial nature of the great majority of these\ntransactions, that it would rarely be appropriate to subject express or resulting trustees to the\nvery strictest of duties.\n648 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\nholding a fiduciary power. What if A promises not to revoke B\u2019s\npower to use those funds for that purpose, but then breaks that\npromise and attempts to terminate the arrangement while the\npurpose is still capable of fulfilment? This situation involves a\nconflict between proprietary rights and contractual obligations. If\nentitled under an express trust, there is little doubt that A could\nsuccessfully revoke B\u2019s mandate and leave B to his remedy in\ncontract. In short, the lender\u2019s proprietary rights will \u2018\u2018trump\u2019\u2019 the\ncontractual rights of the recipient.81 However, if A is entitled under\na resulting trust he may not be able to exercise the same control,\nowing to differing fiduciary duties.82 Further, in a case where there\nis no certainty of intention to create an express trust in favour of\nA, and where A promises not to revoke B\u2019s ability to use the\nfunds, it is arguable that there was never a resulting trust in the\nfirst place. As Chambers explains:\nThat contract is the indirect source of the resulting trust. The\nreason why B holds the money on resulting trust for A is\nbecause the contract between A and B prevented B from\nobtaining beneficial ownership of the money. If the contract\ngave B an enforceable right to use the money to pay C, then B\nwould have a beneficial interest in the money and would not\nhold it wholly on resulting trust for A from the outset.83\nIf the terms of the agreement were clear enough to be able to infer\nan intention to create an express trust for A, then a promise by A\nnot to revoke B\u2019s power would not, it is submitted, undermine that\nintention. However, it would undermine an inference (or indeed\nrebut a presumption) that A had not intended B to have beneficial\nownership. It is thus tentatively suggested that the difference\nbetween the express and resulting trust constructions is that a\nperson entitled under a resulting trust is unable to terminate the\narrangement whilst the purpose is still capable of fulfilment.84\n81 Glister, \u2018\u2018Twinsectra v. Yardley: Trusts, Powers and Contractual Obligations\u2019\u2019 (2002) 16 Trust\nLaw International 223. It should be noted here that, although this discussion has presumed\nthat the transferred property would be money, there is arguably no theoretical bar to the type\nof property that can be subject to a Quistclose trust: see Carreras Rothmans Ltd. v. Freeman\nMatthews Treasure Ltd. [1985] 1 Ch. 207, 222 per Peter Gibson J; Worthington (1996), op. cit.,\nn. 72, p. 63. This is mentioned because of the possibility of B getting specific performance of\nA\u2019s contractual duties if A should wrongly revoke B\u2019s power to apply the funds.\n82 See the sources cited above, n. 74, and the associated text.\n83 Chambers, \u2018\u2018Restrictions on the Use of Money\u2019\u2019, p. 86.\n84 Birks takes a slightly different view, commenting that \u2018\u2018It is not unusual to find the Saunders\nv. Vautier right fettered by contract, but under the Twinsectra construction it must be.\nOtherwise the transfer would be instantly revocable. In the absence of any express contract\nthere must be an implied contract not to attempt to recall the legal title so long as the\n[purpose] remains in place.\u2019\u2019 P. Birks, \u2018\u2018Retrieving Tied Money\u2019\u2019 in Swadling, The Quistclose\nTrust, p. 126.\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 649\n. . . Or both?\nClearly an express trust model can by definition only be employed\nin cases where there is sufficient certainty of intention to find a\ntrust in favour A. It is not contended that such intention could\nnever be found in the case of a non-contract transfer, but it is\ncertainly true that evidence of that intention would normally be\nfound in the terms of the parties\u2019 express agreement. Thus an\nexpress trust construction could only be used in certain situations,\nand in many of the older cases the requisite intention to create a\ntrust would seem to be lacking.85\nIt is therefore argued that both constructions must be\npotentially valid, depending on the facts of the case. An express\ntrust requires intention to create a trust, while a resulting trust\nanalysis requires only that A did not intend B to receive full\nbeneficial title.86 As Yeo and Tjio point out, this clearly involves \u2018\u2018a\nlower threshold for proving a trust\u2019\u2019.87 However, as suggested\nabove, the two constructions do differ in their effects and it would\nstill be more advantageous to a lender to be in the position of a\nbeneficiary entitled under an express trust.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nWhere A transfers property to B, so that B can pay C, several\nconstructions are possible. Depending on the facts of a particular\ncase it may be more appropriate to classify the relationship as one\nof any of the following:\n* Express trust for C, with B as trustee.\n* Express trust for A, with B as trustee.\n* Resulting trust for A, with B as trustee.\n* Full ownership to B, with A holding a personal right to\nrestrain misuse.\n* Full ownership to B, unrestricted by A.\nThis conclusion seeks to determine three issues: firstly, whether or\nnot each model concurs with established equitable principles.\nSecondly it must be decided whether the differing models can co-\n85 See, for example, Toovey v.

The first of these is the \u2018\u2018trust for C\u2019\u2019 construction whereby\nthe beneficial interest in the advanced funds is held on trust by the\nrecipient, B, for the third party, C. Such a model would be apposite\nwhere the agreement between A and B contained the requisite\ncertainty of intention to create the trust for C. Under this\nconstruction A could transfer his equitable interest directly to C, or\nhe could transfer full ownership to B who would subsequently\ndeclare himself trustee of that property for C. The third party\nwould be an absolutely-entitled beneficiary under an express trust,\nable to restrain misuse, terminate the trust, and possibly compel\nperformance.88 The identity of the settlor would be relevant in the\nevent that C could not be the object of a trust, but otherwise this\nmodel is straightforward and does not pose any problems as\nregards concordance with equitable principles. However, the\nproblem with characterising this arrangement as a Quistclose trust is\nthe lack of security that would be held by A. As has already been\nmentioned, \u2018\u2018the whole purpose of the arrangements . . . is to\nprevent the money from passing to the borrower\u2019s trustee in\nbankruptcy in the event of his insolvency\u2019\u2019.89 It is thus concluded\nthat while such a trust would be consistent with orthodoxy, and\ncan exist happily without undermining the other models, it should\nnot properly be termed a Quistclose trust.\nUnrestricted ownership to B\nThe second model that is also unproblematic arises where A\ntransfers money to B to enable B to apply those funds for a\nparticular purpose, but does not attempt to restrict B\u2019s use of that\nmoney. In this instance the full ownership of that property is\ntransferred to B, most commonly with B owing A an appropriate\namount under the terms of a loan agreement. A does not attempt\nto retain beneficial ownership, nor restrict B\u2019s use of the money\n88 As an absolutely-entitled beneficiary, C would be able to restrain her trustee\u2019s misuse of the\nfunds. C could also terminate the trust under the principle in Saunders v. Vautier (1841) 4\nBeav. 115. C would be able to compel performance if she could rely on the contract between\nA and B under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. However, given that C\nwould be entitled to terminate the trust, a right to compel performance may not be required\nanyway.\n89 Twinsectra v. Yardley [2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [82] per Lord Millett.\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 651\n(although a purpose may be intended or contemplated), and thus A\ndoes not have any security over the funds.90 Again, while such an\narrangement is clearly conceivable\u2014and may appear similar in\nsome cases to a Quistclose device\u2014given that the legal and\nequitable estates are never split the device cannot properly be\ntermed a trust.\nTrue Quistclose arrangements\nExpress trust for A\nThree constructions remain: an express trust for A, a resulting trust\nfor A, and a situation whereby B owns the property but A holds a\npersonal right to restrain misuse. The first of these is relatively\nstraightforward, but requires a high degree of scrutiny of the\nparties\u2019 expressed intentions. Under this model A becomes the\nbeneficiary of an express trust, the requisite certainty of intention\nbeing contained within the parties\u2019 transfer agreement (most\ncommonly a loan contract). However, there must be a clear\nintention that B is to hold the funds on trust for A: a mere\nintention that B is not to receive full beneficial title himself is not\nsufficient. It is in this respect that the intentions must be carefully\nscrutinised: as Ulph suggests, \u2018\u2018there is at least some risk that\npromises made during negotiations for a loan could be found to\nsuffice as evidence of an intention to create a trust\u2019\u2019.91 That said,\nshould the required intention be present, there would be no reason\nto deny the existence of an express trust in favour of A: such an\ninterpretation is clearly consistent with established principles. The\neffect of such an arrangement would be that A would have security\nover the funds: as B would not be the beneficial owner the property\nwould not be available to his trustee in bankruptcy. In addition to\nthis security in the event of his debtor\u2019s insolvency, A would also be\nable to exercise certain rights during the life of the trust through\nhis position as beneficiary: he would be able to restrain misuse and\ncould also bring the arrangement to a end by terminating the\ntrust.92\n90 It may be possible for A to have de facto security through other means, but again this would\nnot pertain to a restriction on B\u2019s use of that particular property.\n91 J. Ulph, \u2018\u2018Equitable Proprietary Rights in Insolvency: The Ebbing Tide?\u2019\u2019 [1996] J.B.L. 482,\np. 495.\n92 Revoking the power would result in a pure bare trust with the trustee B holding property to\nthe order of the beneficiary A. As a matter of property law A could also compel B to\nconsider the exercise of the power, although A would have to rely on a contract to actually\ncompel B to carry out his duties. Should such personal rights exist, it may well be easier for\nA to restrain misapplication through the common law, especially given that B would still be\nsolvent. The equitable rights would then act as a \u2018\u2018long-stop\u2019\u2019.\n652 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\nResulting trust for A\nAn express trust for A is both conceivable and, due to A\u2019s security,\na true example of a Quistclose trust. However, it is also argued that\nsuch a construction is not the only one available to the courts: a\nresulting trust analysis may be more appropriate. This is similar to\nthe express trust model in that B holds on trust for A, but it arises\nin different circumstances. Whereas an express trust construction\nwould require certainty of intention to create a trust for A, a\nresulting trust model requires only that B was not intended to\nreceive full beneficial ownership of the property. The beneficial title\nwould then revert to A. It has been argued that, should B be\nrequired to apply the funds for the purpose (rather than being\nmerely at liberty to do so), then this is indicative of an intention\nthat B should not receive full beneficial title. That is, A reposes\ntrust and confidence in B to the effect that B will apply the funds,\nB is fully aware of the situation, and B is thus a fiduciary. It\nshould also be noted that, unlike in an express trust situation where\nthe certainty of intention will nearly always need to be adduced\nfrom a contract, a resulting trust analysis is more readily available\nin the case of non-contract transfers.\nUnder a resulting trust, the beneficiary A would be able to\nretrain misuse and compel application of the funds.93 However, it\nhas been argued that the fiduciary duties owed by B to A will differ\nif the trust is resulting, and more specifically A may not be able to\nterminate the arrangement whilst the purpose is still capable of\nfulfilment.94 Simply put, B\u2019s fiduciary obligations should not extend\nthis far. This is the distinction between a situation where A is\nentitled under an express trust and a case where the device is a\nresulting trust.\nA resulting trust construction satisfies our criteria: both models\nare potentially valid in that a finding of the requisite intention to\ncreate an express trust in one case would not preclude a resulting\ntrust analysis in another; analysis in this area would proceed in the\nsame way as any other resulting trust case; and the lender does\nindeed hold security over the transferred assets.\nRestricted ownership to B\nThe final construction is that of B obtaining full ownership of the\ntransferred funds, but with A holding a personal right to restrain\nmisuse of those funds. This is the theory advanced by Chambers,\nalthough he appeared to think that such an analysis was\n93 By exercising personal rights under the contract and equitable rights held by virtue of his\nposition as beneficiary. See n. 87 above.\n94 See above, nn. 74\u201380 and associated text.\nC.L.J. Quistclose Trusts 653\ninconsistent with a resulting trust analysis.95 That is, Chambers\nargued that Quistclose trusts were characterised not by an ability to\ncompel performance, but by the restriction of the recipient\u2019s right\nto use the property.96 This assertion has been rightly criticised,97 but\nit is argued that Chambers\u2019 theory is still valid in the cases where\nthere was indeed no right to compel performance. In such a\nsituation the lack of A\u2019s right to compel performance would\nundermine any argument that B had not been intended to gain full\nbeneficial ownership. Thus a resulting trust would not arise. Instead\nB would receive full ownership, subject to A\u2019s personal right to\nrestrain misuse of the money.\nSuch an arrangement seems unproblematic, but it also seems to\ndeny A any security. Unlike beneficiaries under express or resulting\ntrusts, here the lender cannot compel the application of the funds\nto the purpose: all she can do is seek an injunction to prevent\nmisapplication. However, it is important not to confuse a lack of\ncontrol during the life of the transaction with security on a debtor\u2019s\ninsolvency. Under this construction the distinction between primary\nand secondary trusts, irrelevant when dealing with trusts for the\nlender, becomes important again. During the primary stage\u2014while\nthe property has not been misapplied and the purpose is still\ncapable of fulfilment\u2014the beneficial title to the property is vested\nin the borrower. At this stage A does intend B to have beneficial\nownership. However, there is a potential secondary stage: should B\nmisapply some of the money, or become insolvent and thus unable\nto carry out the purpose, the beneficial interest will at that point\nrevert to A.98 The lender has very little control over the borrower\nin the first stage, but that does not mean that she has no security\nin the potential second stage. Thus, although under this\nconstruction there exists only a \u2018\u2018secondary\u2019\u2019 trust, this may be\naccurately described as a Quistclose trust.\nExpress trusts for third parties and unrestricted transfers are not\nQuistclose trusts: not because they are invalid, but simply because\nthey do not provide security for the original lender. Although\n95 It is now accepted that the models are not contradictory: Chambers, \u2018\u2018Restrictions on the Use\nof Money\u2019\u2019, p. 88.\n96 Chambers, Resulting Trusts, p. 86.\n97 See the comments of Ho and Smart, \u2018\u2018Re-interpreting the Quistclose Trust: A Critique of\nChambers\u2019 Analysis\u2019\u2019 (2001) 21 O.J.L.S. 267, p. 278; and Lord Millett in Twinsectra v. Yardley\n[2002] 2 A.C. 164, at [76] and [95].\n98 Regarding B misapplying the funds, see discussion above, nn. 39 and 52. The resulting trust\ncould also spring up when B becomes unable to apply the funds. B\u2019s inability could be\nobjective: for example, the appointment of a receiver; or could be provided for in the original\ncontract between A and B (in much the same way as parties may choose an event that will\ncrystallise a floating charge in to a fixed charge). In either of these cases the problem of an\ninitial misapplication followed by a subsequent \u2018\u2018correct\u2019\u2019 application, discussed above at n.\n52, does not arise.\n654 The Cambridge Law Journal [2004]\nevidential issues may mean they are relatively rare, express trusts\nfor lenders are Quistclose trusts: they are entirely consistent with\nestablished principles and provide security for the original\ntransferor. Resulting trusts for lenders and instances where\nrestricted ownership is vested in the recipient are perhaps more\nworthy of discussion due to the various attempts to categorise all\nQuistclose trusts as one or the other. Yet such attempts are\nunnecessary: both are consistent with orthodoxy, provide adequate\nsecurity and can co-exist with each other. If A attempts to restrict\nB\u2019s use of money, but does not compel her to use that money, then\nthe former construction will apply. A\u2019s ability to control B during\nthe primary stage will be much less than if A were a beneficiary,\nbut in the secondary stage the beneficial title reverts to her under\nresulting trust. If on the other hand A does have a right to compel\nB to spend the money, then that is indicative of A retaining a\nbeneficial interest. It is argued that both models are potentially\nvalid, with the critical distinction being A\u2019s right to either compel\nthe application of funds, or merely to restrain misuse.\nC.L.J.
