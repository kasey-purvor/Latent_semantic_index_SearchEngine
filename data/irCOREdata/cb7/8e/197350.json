If the prevalence of autism is\nincreasing, rates in older adults would be expected to be\nlower than rates among younger adults.\nObjective: To estimate the prevalence and character-\nistics of adults with ASD living in the community in\nEngland.\nDesign:A stratified,multiphase random samplewas used\nin the thirdnational surveyofpsychiatricmorbidity inadults\nin England in 2007. Survey data were weighted to take ac-\ncount of study design and nonresponse so that the results\nwere representative of the household population.\nSetting:General community (ie, private households) in\nEngland.\nParticipants: Adults (people 16 years or older).\nMain OutcomeMeasures: Autism Diagnostic Obser-\nvation Schedule, Module 4 in phase 2 validated against\nthe Autism Diagnostic Interview\u2013Revised and Diagnos-\ntic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders\nin phase 3. A 20-item subset of theAutism-SpectrumQuo-\ntient self-completion questionnaire was used in phase 1\nto select respondents for phase 2.

Rates were higher in men, those\nwithout educational qualifications, and those living in\nrented social (government-financed) housing. There was\nno evidence of increased use of services for mental\nhealth problems.\nConclusions:Conducting epidemiologic research onASD\nin adults is feasible. The prevalence of ASD in this popu-\nlation is similar to that found in children. The lack of an\nassociation with age is consistent with there having been\nno increase in prevalence and with its causes being tem-\nporally constant. Adults with ASD living in the commu-\nnity are socially disadvantaged and tend to be unrecog-\nnized.\nArch Gen Psychiatry. 2011;68(5):459-466\nA UTISM SPECTRUM DISOR-ders (ASDs) are neurode-velopmentaldisorderschar-acterized by impairment ofreciprocal social interac-\ntion and communication and restricted re-\npetitive behaviors.1 They have persisting\nnegative effects on learning and develop-\nment of independence in adulthood.2 In\n2007, the yearly cost to society of each adult\nwith ASD inGreat Britainwas estimated to\nbe \u00a390 000.3 Adults with ASDs are more\nlikely tobe recognizedand supported if they\nalsohave severe intellectual disability; those\nwith higher levels of functioning tend to be\noverlooked in the community.4\nIn childhood, ASDs are associatedwith\nintellectual disability and male sex. More\nrecent surveys5-7 report higher preva-\nlence estimates. In children, the median\nrate in 16 surveys published between 1966\nand 1991 was 4.4 per 10 000 population;\nthe median rate in 16 surveys published\nbetween 1992 and 2001 was 12.7 per\n10 000.6 In 3 recent large regionwide or na-\ntional community surveys8-10 of children\nand adolescents in England, the preva-\nlence of ASD was approximately 10 per\n1000. It is not known whether this re-\nported increased prevalence reflects case\nfinding changes or increasing incidence\ndue to newly emerging causes. Among in-\ntellectually disabled adults (\u00020.5% of the\noverall adult population), a rate of 75 per\n1000was obtained froman intellectual dis-\nability case register11 that incorporated\nidentification from direct observation, de-\ntailed case records, and interviews with\ncaregivers.

Adults in Great\nBritain who have responded to postal and online sur-\nveys13 stating that they have ASD aremore oftenmale (2:\n1), rarely 65 years or older, and rarely in full-time em-\nployment.

We used a multiple-phase design:\nan initial screening phase of adults in the community, a di-\nrect observation second phase, and developmental inter-\nviews of collateral informants in a third phase.\nWe hypothesized that, in the community, the rate of\nASDs in early adulthood would be similar to that re-\nported in older children but that far fewer cases would\nbe found among older adults, particularly those in the\nretirement age range. We also hypothesized that adults\nwith ASDs would be more likely to be male and disad-\nvantaged socioeconomically and less likely to be receiv-\ning support frommental health services than adults with\nother mental disorders.\nMETHODS\nThe third national Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey in En-\ngland, carried out in 2007,14 used a stratified 2-phase design\nbased on a random probability sample. Postcode sectors (on\naverage, 2550 households) were stratified on the basis of amea-\nsure of socioeconomic status within a regional breakdown\n(Figure1). All primary sampling units were then further strati-\nfied on the basis of the proportion of adults employed in non\u2013\nmanual labor jobs and sorted by the proportion of households\nwithout a motor vehicle based on 2001 UK Census data (http:\n\/\/www.statistics.gov.uk\/about\/data\/methodology\/specific\n\/population\/PEMethodology\/).Next, postal sectorswere sampled\nfrom each stratum with a probability proportional to size; 519\npostal sectors were selected, with 28 delivery points randomly\nselected in each (yielding 14 532 delivery points). Interview-\ners visited these to identify private households in England con-\ntaining at least 1 adult (16 years or older) (Figure 1). Ethical\napproval for the study was obtained from the Royal FreeMedi-\ncal School Research Ethics Committee, London, England.\nTo estimate the prevalence of ASD among adults in the com-\nmunity, a subset of questions from a self-report autism trait\nscreening questionnaire, the Autism-SpectrumQuotient (AQ),15\nwas used in phase 1. This tool was used to select participants\nfor a second-phase evaluation using detailed clinical assess-\nments based on module 4 of the Autism Diagnostic Observa-\ntion Schedule, Module 4 (ADOS-4).16 The 50-item AQ and a\nrecently published17 factor analytically derived 28-itemAQhave\nbeen validated cross-culturally.18 For each phase 1 respon-\ndent, the probability of selection for a phase 2 diagnostic as-\nsessment was calculated from respondents\u2019 answers to screen-\ning questions in the phase 1 questionnaire14,19 as the highest of\n4 disorder-specific probabilities (ASD, psychosis, borderline per-\nsonality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder).\nThe higher the score on the phase 1 screens, the greater the\nlikelihood of being selected for phase 2. The selection process\nfor a third validation phase is described in the next section.\nMEASURES\nWe used stepwise logistic regression to develop a 20-item sub-\nset of the 50-itemAQ, using previously gathered diagnostic clinic\nand control data.15,19 The 20-item version (AQ-20) was admin-\nistered to all phase 1 respondents to generate a probability of\nselection for the detailed phase 2 diagnostic assessment. Phase\n1 respondents also completed questionnaires covering physi-\ncal and mental health, socioeconomic factors, use of mental\nhealth services,14 and willingness to take part in further inter-\nviews. Predicted verbal IQ (V-IQ; range estimate, 70-130) was\nderived using the National Adult Reading Test20; V-IQ was the\nonly method for estimating IQ available in the 2007 Adult Psy-\nchiatric Morbidity Survey, although its validity in community\ncases of ASD is untested. National Centre for Social Research\ninterviewers conducted fieldwork fromOctober 2006 through\nDecember 2007. A few of the selected respondents were inca-\npable of undertaking the interview alone because of mental or\nphysical incapacity. For them, the option of a proxy interview\nwith another member of the household or someone else who\nknew themwell was available (Figure 1). The information col-\nlected was insufficient for selection probabilities to be calcu-\nlated, and respondents interviewed by proxy were therefore in-\neligible for phase 2 interviews.\nPhase 2 ASD assessments were based on the ADOS-4, a face-\nto-face clinical assessment of current behavior consistent with\na diagnosis of ASD. It consists of tests termed presses that evalu-\nate communication, reciprocal social interaction, creativity,\nimagination, and stereotyped and restricted interests. The\nADOS-4 incorporates algorithms for ASD,21 applied to se-\nlected ADOS-4 ratings corresponding to DSM-IV22 criteria for\npervasive developmental disorder.

Training experiencewas gained through assessing adults\nliving in the community, including students, and working age\nand older adults who had a clinician-determined diagnosis of\nan ASD such as Asperger syndrome. Interviewing in the field\ndid not commence until the 4 interviewers achieved at least 90%\nagreement on ratings of jointly observed ADOS-4 examina-\ntions. During fieldwork, interviewers received supervision ses-\nsions and prepared ASD case vignette reports. They took part\nin debriefing after the interviews to add further contextual in-\nformation.\nA threshold of 10 or greater on the ADOS-4 total score is\nrecommended for identifying cases of autism,21 provided it in-\ncludes scores of at least 3 on the Communication domain and\nat least 6 on Reciprocal Social Interaction. To our knowledge,\nfor the first time in a community sample and in older adults,19\nwe validated this threshold for determining a case of ASD using\nthe ADOS-4, with 54 assessments carried out by the senior re-\nsearch psychologist in a third study phase (Figure 1). These\nassessments included developmental interviews with family\nmembers or other suitable informants of second-phase respon-\ndents, half of whom had a high probability of having ASD. The\nAutism Diagnostic Interview\u2013Revised23 and the Diagnostic In-\nterview for Social and Communication Disorders24 were ad-\nministered. The appropriateness of using a threshold of 10 or\ngreater was tested using models based on predicting cases of\nASD from these 2 tools (details of these assessments and of clini-\ncal consensus diagnoses will be reported separately).\nANALYSIS\nSurvey data were weighted to take account of study design and\nnonresponse so that the results were representative in terms\nof age, sex, region, and area characteristics of the household\npopulation 16 years or older in England.14 First, sample weights\nwere applied to take account of the different probabilities of\nselecting respondents in different-sized households. Second, to\nreduce household nonresponse bias, a household-level weight\nwas calculated from a logistic regression model using inter-\nviewer observation and area-level variables (using 2001UKCen-\nsus data) available for responding and nonresponding house-\nholds. The nonresponse weight for each household was\ncalculated as the inverse of the probability of response esti-\nmated from the model multiplied by the household\u2019s selection\nweight. Finally, weights were applied using the techniques of\ncalibration weighting based on age, sex, and region to weight\nthe data to represent the structure of the national population,\nby taking account of differential nonresponse between re-\ngions and age\u0003sex groups. The population control totals used\nwere the Office for National Statistics 2006 midyear house-\nhold population estimates.25 Phase 2 weights were designed to\ngenerate condition-specific phase 2 data sets representative of\nthe population eligible for phase 2 by virtue of that particular\ncondition. Combining the phase 2weighted data with the phase\n1 weighted data for the noneligible group thus gives data rep-\nresentative of the whole adult population. Because incomplete\nresponse could bias survey estimates, we investigated possible\nnonresponse bias: we compared the probability of ASD (phase\n1 AQ-20 score) between geographic regions by regional re-\nsponse rate and by each respondent\u2019s willingness to take fur-\nther part in the survey.\nWeighted prevalence estimates were determined using an\nADOS-4 threshold of 10 or greater (PROC SURVEYFREQ, ver-\nsion 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and for com-\nparison a range of thresholds from 7 or greater to 13 or greater.\nThe distribution of AQ-20 and ADOS-4 scores was examined\nusing histograms. The small number of people identified as hav-\ning ASD (in terms of the number of ADOS-4 cases found)means\nthat caution is required in interpreting the population distri-\nbution of ASD. Variation in prevalence of ASD by other char-\nacteristics was examined in univariable and multivariable\nweighted logistic regressionmodels (PROCSURVEYLOGISTIC,\nversion 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc) and by examining the pre-\ndicted probability of being a case as a function of continu-\nously measured characteristics (age and V-IQ). The sample for\nthese analyses consisted of phase 1 respondents with a near zero\nprobability ofASD (AQ-20 score\u00025, classified as non-ASDcases)\ntogether with all respondents who completed a full ADOS-4\nin phase 2. Phase 1 respondents with an AQ-20 score of 5 to\n20 who were not administered a phase 2 assessment were ex-\ncluded as unknowns and accounted for in the weighting.\nRESULTS\nOf the 13 171 households identified as potentially eli-\ngible in the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, 4075 re-\nfused; 7461 individuals in the households (56.6%) pro-\nvided a complete phase 1 interview. Of these, 849 people\nwere selected for phase 2 interviews; 62 refused and no\ncontact was made with 157, leaving 630 participants\n(74.2%) who completed phase 2 assessments (Figure 1).\nFull ADOS-4 assessments were carried out in 618 par-\nticipants. Nonresponse bias was investigated by compar-\ning the proportion scoring 13 or greater on the AQ-20\nin the 5 regions with the highest response rate and the 6\nregions with the lowest response rate in phase 1: it was\n1.1% and 1.2%, respectively; using weighted data, it was\n1.1% and 1.3%. Refusal to take part by participants se-\nlected for a phase 2 interview was 24% overall: the pro-\nportion of those who refused and scored 13 or greater\non the AQ-20 was 24.3% among individuals with an\nAQ-20 score of 0 to 12 and 23.3% among those with an\nAQ-20 score of 13 to 20. Neither comparison gave any\nindication that survey participation was associated with\nhaving ASD. The ADOS-4 threshold of 10 or greater for\nASDwas supported bymodels based on predicting cases\nof ASD from the phase 4 Diagnostic Interview for Social\nand Communication Disorders and Autism Diagnostic\nInterview\u2013Reviseddevelopmental assessments (detailswill\nbe reported separately).\nUsing the validated threshold of a score of 10 or greater\non the ADOS-4 to indicate a case of ASD, we deter-\nmined that the overall prevalence of ASD in the English\npopulation of individuals 16 years or older was 9.8 per\n1000 population (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-\n16.5). Table 1 includes the unweighted and weighted\nnumbers of cases andweighted estimates for ADOS-4 cut-\noffs from 7 or greater to 12 or greater. The estimated V-IQ\nof our ASD cases ranged from 70 (and less) to 100.\nUNIVARIABLE MODELS\nThe rate of ASD amongmen (18.2 per 1000; 95%CI, 4.2-\n32.2)wasmuch greater than amongwomen (2.0 per 1000;\n95% CI, 00.0-4.3).

The pre-\ndicted probability of ASD suggested a gradual decrease\nwith increasing years, although the trend was not sig-\nnificant (odds ratio, 0.99; 95%CI, 0.94-1.04; P=.55); as-\nsuming that this is the true odds ratio, for every extra year\nof age, the odds of ASDwould decrease by 1%. The lower\nlimit of the 95% CI suggests a decrease in the odds of\n6% with every increasing year of age. In a univariable\nmodel, the predicted probability of ASD (ADOS-4\u000410)\nwas inversely related to V-IQ score (odds ratio, 0.94; 95%\nCI, 0.87-0.99; P=.04); for every unit increase in V-IQ\nscore, the odds of ASD decreased by 6.0%.\nHaving ASD was significantly associated with living\nin accommodation rented from a social landlord (local\nauthority or housing association) rather than from a pri-\nvate landlord or owned by the participant or other mem-\nber of the household (Table 2). The presence of ASDwas\nhigher in participants without any educational qualifi-\ncations than in those with university-level qualifica-\ntions (Table 2).\nThe presence of ASDwas significantly associated with\nbeing single (Table 2). A relative preponderance of ASD\nin more deprived local areas (wards) was close to being\nstatistically significant (P=.06; Table 2). There was no\noverall association between equivalized household in-\ncome and the presence of ASD; in participants living in\nhouseholds with the highest income, ASD was less fre-\nquent than among those with the lowest incomes, which\nwas close to being statistically significant (P=.06; Table 2).\nNo significant association was identified between house-\nhold composition and ASD. People who did not know\nwhether they received state benefits had higher odds of\nhaving ASD (Table 2); there was insufficient informa-\ntion to determine whether receiving benefits was asso-\nciated with ASD. Among working-age participants (aged\n16-64 years), we found no significant association with\neconomic activity. We had insufficient data to evaluate\nTable 1.

These\ndata are not shown in a table because the base number\nfor people with ASD was too small to make meaningful\nstatistical comparisons (19 cases were identified in the\n2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey sample). Nev-\nertheless, there was no evidence of increased use of ser-\nvices for mental or emotional problems by people with\nASD in the preceding month or year. None of the cases\nfound in this study had previously been given a formal\nautism assessment or diagnosis.\nCOMMENT\nAutism spectrum disorder affects approximately 1% of\nthe adult English household population. There was no\nevidence of a statistically significant reduction in preva-\nlence of ASDs as a function of age. Prevalence was great-\nest in men, in those living in social housing, and in those\nwith the lowest educational qualifications. Adults with\nASD appear to be largely unrecognized. To our knowl-\nedge, there are no previous systematic community sur-\nveys of adults with which to compare these findings.\nThe survey was based on the most validated investi-\ngator-rated diagnostic instruments available for study-\ning the prevalence of ASD in adults. However, a number\nof study limitations should be considered. The number\nof cases we identified was small, but our sampling strat-\negy, as well as our approach to weighting, means that we\ncould account for the low specificity and sensitivity of\nour phase 1 screening measure. Because we screened\npeople from across a wide range of AQ-20 score strata,\nour prevalence estimate is probably reliable. The cost and\nthe burdenof includingADOS-4 assessments during phase\n1 would have been unsustainable. There is thus a need\nto develop improved phase 1 screening. Sampling ex-\ncluded institutional residents and adults with intellec-\ntual disability severe enough to prevent them from par-\nticipating in the assessment. A definitive estimate of\nprevalence in the whole adult population would require\nadditional sampling in those populations. The associa-\ntionwith low intellectual ability in our household sample\nsuggests that our sampling and interviewingmethods did\nnot exclude any but the most severely intellectually dis-\nabled adults. The 57% response rate in phase 1 was dis-\nappointing. Response rates in surveys have been declin-\ning inmost countries during the past decade.26 However,\nour estimates were weighted to take account of differ-\nences between census data and the profile of the partici-\n.05\n.03\n.04\n.02\n.01\n.00\n0 50 7040302010 60 80 90 100\nAge of Selected Respondent, y\nEs\ntim\nat\ned\n P\nro\nba\nbi\nlit\ny\nFigure 2.

Sensitivity analyses showed no evidence of a non-\nresponse bias; reluctance to cooperate was not associated\nwith a higher phase 1 AQ-20 score. This finding is sup-\nported by recent research showing that nonresponse rate\nalone is a weak predictor of nonresponse bias and by re-\ncent studies suggesting that changes in nonresponse rates\ndo not necessarily alter survey estimates.27 Further-\nmore, the phase 2 weighting took account of variation\nin response rate by phase 1 AQ-20 score, age, and sex.\nBias in prevalence estimation can be eliminated if an as-\nsumption of missingness at randomwithin these adjust-\nment cells is justified.28 In amissingness-at-random situ-\nation, missingness depends on demographic or other\ncharacteristics that can be adjusted for using weighting.\nIf, after such adjustment has been made, missingness is\nnot related to the survey outcome, missing data can be\nsaid to bemissing at random.Given our sensitivity analy-\nses and the absence of any other information to the con-\ntrary, it is plausible thatwithin age, sex, region, andAQ-20\nscore groups (the variables upon which our weighting\nwas based), ourmissing data situation approximates rea-\nsonably well to missingness at random.We found noth-\ning in the literature on nonresponse bias pertaining to\nASD specifically; nonresponse has been linked to psy-\nchopathologic factors in some studies,29 but it is not clear\nin which direction the overall burden of bias lies.\nThe small number of cases identified (n=19) limited\nour ability to identify possible associations. For ex-\nample, although the prevalence of ASD appeared greater\nin adults living in themost deprived localities and in those\nin the lowest household income groups (Table 2), these\nassociations were not statistically significant; however,\nsuch associations cannot be ruled out given thewide con-\nfidence intervals. Nevertheless, the study was powered\nto generate a prevalence estimate within a prespecified\n95% CI, rather than to test hypotheses associating ASD\nstatus with particular attributes.\nFor practical reasons, large surveys of adults usually\npreclude the involvement of collateral informants ca-\npable of describing the respondent\u2019s behavior over time,\nincluding in childhood. Our principal in-depth out-\ncome measure, the ADOS-4, is limited to direct obser-\nvation in an artificial context. However, detailed assess-\nments in a supplementary third phase sample (to be\nreported separately) and using well-established devel-\nopmental interviews showed good agreement with the\nADOS-4. Intellectual ability is an important factor in de-\ntermining the outcome of ASD in adulthood2; our mea-\nsure of V-IQ was limited and has not been validated for\ncommunity-living adults with ASD. However, educa-\ntional level achieved is regarded as a good index of abil-\nity andwasmore strongly associatedwithASD in ourmul-\ntivariable model. Our assessment methods provided\ninsufficient information for subtyping ASD, but our cases\nwere likely to be Asperger syndrome, pervasive devel-\nopmental disorder\u2013not otherwise specified, and autistic\ndisorder.22\nThe weighted prevalence of 9.8 per 1000 population\nin adults is essentially the same as recently reported8-10\nin systematic surveys of children up to age 15 years. Two\nof these childhood surveys also used age-standardized ver-\nsions of the same diagnostic instrument, the ADOS.8,10\nThis overall rate can be contrastedwith that of othermen-\ntal disorders contributing significantly to the global bur-\nden of disease in adulthood. Thus, the prevalence of ASD\nis approximately twice that of psychosis and half that of\ncurrent depressive episodes assessed in the same sur-\nvey.14 Some research and public health purposes may re-\nquire the use of cut-off points or an ordinal scale or di-\nmensional description of the burden of a disorder. The\ndistribution of ADOS-4 cases (Table 1) suggests conti-\nnuity rather than discontinuity above and below the di-\nagnostic threshold as found in psychiatric disorders such\nas depression.30 Our validation study does not recom-\nmend using a cut-off point of 7 or greater (Table 1) on\nthe ADOS-4, although the developers21 have suggested\nthat this might be acceptable in combination with other\ndetailed clinical information. The higher estimated preva-\nlence in men vs women was based on the ADOS-4. The\nself-report AQ-20 used in phase 1 suggested a smaller sex\ndifference in those with high scores. This variability is\nin line with childhood studies7 showing that the sex dif-\nference is less when subthreshold forms of the condi-\ntion are studied. It could also indicate differences be-\ntween instruments in the identification of the less common\nfemale form of autism, although this seems less likely.\nSome degree of heterogeneity is likely to underlie the be-\nhavioral presentation of our autismprevalence cases; such\nheterogeneity may cause problems in the design and in-\nterpretation of community treatment trials.31\nOur survey lacked the statistical power to examine\nsmall but possibly clinically and etiologically important\ndifferences between cohorts in rates of ASD according\nto age. Our CI for age is consistent with a percentage in-\ncrease in prevalence of 4% or a percentage decrease of\n6% per year of age. Small reductions of prevalence with\nage could be explained by increased mortality in au-\ntism32 or by older respondents being less available to par-\nticipate in a household survey because of loss of family\nsupport or increased use of institutionalization. How-\never, based on the literature reviewed earlier, we would\nexpect substantially lower rates in earlier birth cohorts\n(older respondents) if rates of ASD have been rising con-\nsiderably during recent decades, and we would also ex-\npect lower rates in younger adults than in recent child-\nhood surveys using the ADOS-4. We did not find this.\nOverall, our findings suggest that prevalence is neither\nrising nor falling significantly. This favors the interpre-\ntation that methods of ascertainment have changed in\nmore recent surveys of children compared with the ear-\nliest surveys in which the rates reported were consider-\nably lower. Our data suggest that the causes of autism\nappear to be temporally constant and that recent appar-\nent rises in rates of diagnosis must therefore reflect bet-\nter survey case finding rather than some new environ-\nmental toxin. However, we urge caution and the need\nfor independent replication of this first set of adult com-\nmunity survey findings. Whether using cross-sectional\nsurvey or cohort33 sampling designs, further work with\nadults is needed to improve the specificity and sensitiv-\nity of self-report measures of ASD.\nThe finding that adults with ASD are socially disad-\nvantaged, at a lower educational level, less able intellec-\ntually, and apparently unrecognized bymental health ser-\nARCH GEN PSYCHIATRY\/VOL 68 (NO. 5), MAY 2011 WWW.ARCHGENPSYCHIATRY.COM\n464\n\u00a92011 American Medical Association.

This is in\na country with well-established social, educational, wel-\nfare, and health care services funded from taxation. Re-\nsearch is also needed in lower-income countries where\nclinical experience suggests that ASD is prevalent and dis-\nabling. Participants with ASDs were less likely to know\nabout a key aspect of their financial circumstances,\nnamely, whether they are receiving state financial ben-\nefits (Table 2). This is in line with the clinical observa-\ntion that many people with ASD are ill equipped toman-\nage their finances. Previous work34,35 shows that adults\nwithmental health disorders receivemore attention from\nservices because these problems are recognized needs.\nHowever, we found no statistically significant increase\nin use of the services among adults with ASD. The cases\nidentified in this survey were apparently not clinically\nrecognized; the underrecognition of ASDs was also ap-\nparent in a recent national audit4 of support formore able\nadults with autism from local government and the na-\ntional health service in England. This audit also makes a\nreasoned economic argument for increasing the identi-\nfication of adults with ASD and for supporting them to\nobtain and maintain appropriate paid employment. The\ncharacteristics of our community survey cases appear to\ndiffer from those of adults who have responded to postal\nand online surveys stating that they have an ASD,13 em-\nphasizing the importance of systematic case finding for\npublic health information. Formal comparison of com-\nmunity and clinically diagnosed cases is not yet pos-\nsible. However, it would appear that cases are often un-\nderdiagnosed in elderly individuals, thosewith lower levels\nof functioning, those in paid employment, and men.\nThere are no effectivemedical treatments for ASD, par-\nticularly in adulthood. Adults with ASD have enduring\nproblems with communication and social understand-\ning. However, social care services are being developed\nto support them, based on the principle that staff recog-\nnize and accept the presence of the condition and learn\nhow tounderstand and communicatewith thosewhohave\nit. This might, for example, improve access to sustained\npaid employment.36 In our clinical experience, provid-\ning this sort of social care to adults with a diagnosis of\nASD leads to improvements in quality of life and reduc-\ntions in the inappropriate use of high-cost hospital ser-\nvices.\nTo our knowledge, we have demonstrated for the first\ntime in the general population that the rate of ASD is not\nsignificantly associatedwith age, suggesting that the causes\nof autism are temporally constant. A great deal more re-\nsearch should be directed at the epidemiology and care\nof adults with this condition.\nSubmitted for Publication: November 12, 2010; ac-\ncepted November 30, 2010.\nCorrespondence: Traolach S.
