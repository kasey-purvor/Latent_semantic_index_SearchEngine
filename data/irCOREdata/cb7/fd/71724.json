It may provide enhanced leaf thermotol-\nerance (Sharkey & Singsaas 1995), it may scavenge ozone\n(Sauer \n \net al\n \n. 1999) and it may act as a signal to promote\nflowering in neighbouring plants (Terry \n \net al\n \n. 1995) but\nnone of these hypotheses have been proved beyond doubt.\nIsoprene is very reactive in the atmosphere and is\nbelieved to play a key role in atmospheric chemistry (e.g.\nFehsenfeld \n \net al\n \n. 1992). It rapidly reacts with the hydroxyl\nradical (OH\n \n\u00b7\n \n) and in fact its emission may control the con-\ncentration of OH\n \n\u00b7\n \n in the atmosphere. Since the OH\n \n\u00b7\n \n con-\ncentration determines the lifetime of methane in the\natmosphere (methane being the third most important\n\u2018greenhouse gas\u2019 in the atmosphere), it can be hypothesized\nthat feedback loops exist between isoprene emission and\nglobal warming.\nIn the context of global change, there is therefore con-\nsiderable interest in understanding how isoprene emissions\nmay change in the future, as global CO\n \n2\n \n concentrations\nincrease. Such changes can be studied by fumigating plants\nwith CO\n \n2\n \n, either in laboratory facilities on potted plants or\nin large CO\n \n2\n \n enrichment facilities on soil-rooted plants.\nExposure to elevated CO\n \n2\n \n often results in a decrease of\nisoprene emission of potted plants (e.g. Loreto & Sharkey\n1990) but growth at elevated CO\n \n2\n \n may not cause the same\neffect. For instance, isoprene emission was reduced in pot-\nted aspen but was enhanced in potted oaks grown at ele-\nvated CO\n \n2\n \n in a growth cabinet (Sharkey, Loreto &\nDelwiche 1991). The response of isoprene to field experi-\nments of CO\n \n2\n \n enrichment also yielded results that were\ndifficult to interpret. Tognetti \n \net al\n \n. (1998) reported that\nisoprene emission is stimulated in \n \nQuercus pubescens\n \nleaves. This experiment was conducted with plants grown\nat naturally high concentration of CO\n \n2\n \n, on the same exper-\n 394\n \nP. A. Scholefield \n \net al\n \n.\n \n\u00a9 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, \n \nPlant, Cell and Environment, \n \n27, \n \n393\u2013401\n \nimental site as our work, and is therefore particularly\nimportant to compare with our results. On the other hand,\nisoprene emission of leaves grown at elevated CO\n \n2\n \n in a\nFree-Air-CO\n \n2\n \n-Enhancement (FACE) facility was substan-\ntially unchanged in \n \nPopulus alba, P. nigra, and P.\n \n \n \n\u00a5\n \neuroamericana\n \n (Loreto \n \net al\n \n. 2001a), and was depressed in\npoplars grown at CO\n \n2\n \n levels higher than ambient in Bio-\nsphere-2 mesocosms (Rosenstiel \n \net al\n \n. 2003). Other iso-\nprenoids are formed through the same metabolic pathway\nas isoprene and probably share the same functions in some\nMediterranean plants. The emission of monoterpenes from\nQ\n \nuercus ilex\n \n plants grown at elevated CO\n \n2\n \n in open top\nchambers (OTC) was generally lower than the emission\nfrom plants grown in OTC with no CO\n \n2\n \n enrichment (Loreto\n \net al\n \n. 2001b). This experiment indicated that the observed\nresponse could be attributed to a biochemical regulation (a\nreduced activity of monoterpene synthases).\nAn alternative approach to the field studies with artificial\nCO\n \n2\n \n enrichment, is to use plants that grow naturally in\nareas of elevated CO\n \n2\n \n, such as those around natural CO\n \n2\n \nsprings. The CO\n \n2\n \n spring of \u2018il Bossoleto\u2019 is an excellent site\nfor studies on CO\n \n2\n \n enrichment (Van Gardingen \n \net al\n \n. 1995)\nand has been previously chosen to study the effect of ele-\nvated CO\n \n2\n \n on isoprene emission (Tognetti \n \net al\n \n. 1998). Il\nBossoleto was one of the two experimental sites of an EC-\nEnvironment project dedicated to predictions of isoprenoid\nemissions under future CO\n \n2\n \n levels and here we present\nresults obtained with one of the most important natural\ngrasses, \n \nPhragmites australis\n \n. \n \nPhragmites\n \n is ubiquitous\naround the world and is a significant emitter of isoprene\n(Loreto & Velikova 2001), especially when the emission is\nintegrated over the packed stand.\n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSampling sites\n \nThe Bossoleto natural CO\n \n2\n \n spring is located in Central Italy\n(43\n \n\u221e\n \n17\n \n\u00a2\n \n N, 11\n \n\u221e\n \n35\n \n\u00a2\n \n E, 272 m a.s.l), near the village of Rapol-\nano Terme, Tuscany, Italy. The virtually pure CO\n \n2\n \n (\n \n>\n \n 99%)\nof geological origin is released by a number of vents at the\nbase and the lower flanks of the natural crater, creating a\nsteep vertical gradient, and accumulating in the bowl in the\nevenings and overnight. Concentrations around the vents\napproach 100% at these times, but during the day the mean\nlong-term CO\n \n2\n \n concentration is approximately twice the\npresent day global average (Van Gardingen \n \net al\n \n. 1995).\nThree veins of freshwater are present in the bottom of the\ncrater and this allows the growth of a dense stand of \n \nPhrag-\nmites\n \n. Plants were sampled in several areas of the spring.\nThe main area of sampling was approximately 25 m from\nthe main vents where CO\n \n2\n \n concentrations varied from 400\nto 1200 \n \nm\n \nmol mol\n \n-\n \n1\n \n, with an average of approximately\n1000 \n \nm\n \nmol mol\n \n-\n \n1\n \n. A second sampling area was selected at\nthe bottom of the spring, where CO\n \n2\n \n concentration was\n \n>\n \n1000 \n \nm\n \nmol mol\n \n-\n \n1\n \n for most of the day and dropped to\naround 400\u20131000 \n \nm\n \nmol mol\n \n-\n \n1\n \n only during the middle hours\nof the day, when measurements were therefore taken.\nPlants were also sampled at three intermediate areas\nbetween the main sampling area and the bottom of the\ncrater. The control site was approximately 1500 m from the\nvents, an open wasteland that is meteorologically and mor-\nphologically similar to the Bossoleto spring, with similar\nfloral and faunal associations, but far enough to be free\nfrom CO\n \n2\n \n-enrichment. The \n \nPhragmites\n \n grows in a depres-\nsion permanently receiving humidity from a subterraneous\nvein of freshwater, a condition similar to that found in the\nCO\n \n2\n \n spring. At both sites, temperature, relative humidity,\nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and CO\n \n2\n \n concen-\ntration were measured and controlled using two environ-\nmental gas monitoring systems (EGM-1; PP-Systems,\nHitchin, Herts., UK and Li-Cor 6400; Li-Cor Lincoln, NE,\nUSA).\n \nGas exchange measurements and \nenvironmental control at leaf level\n \nSystem I\n \nA CIRAS-1 photosynthesis analysis system (PP Systems)\nwas used to monitor exchanges of CO\n \n2\n \n and H\n \n2\n \nO on the last\nfully expanded leaf of \n \nPhragmites\n \n plants, and to establish\ncontrolled environmental conditions before and during\nmeasurements. In particular, relative humidity, PAR and\nleaf temperature were maintained at 50%, 1000 \n \nm\n \nmol m\n \n-\n \n2\n \ns\n \n-\n \n1\n \n, and 30 \n \n\u221e\n \nC, respectively. These are the conditions at\nwhich isoprene \n \nbasal emission\n \n is measured. Basal emission\nis the emission that is used to model and predict isoprene\nemission after correction to take into account temperature\nand light dependency of its biosynthesis (Guenther \n \net al\n \n.\n1993, 1995). The CO\n \n2\n \n concentration in the cuvette was con-\ntrolled automatically by using a CIRAS CO\n \n2\n \n regulator and\ncartridge unit. Leaves at the main Bossoleto sampling area\nwere maintained at 1000 \n \nm\n \nmol mol\n \n-\n \n1\n \n CO\n \n2\n \n, and leaves at the\ncontrol site at 360 \n \nm\n \nmol mol\n \n-\n \n1\n \n since these concentrations\nwere representative of the average CO\n \n2\n \n concentration\nexperienced by the plants throughout their life cycle. For\nmeasurements made at the bottom of the Bossoleto spring,\nthe CO\n \n2\n \n concentration was set at 2000 \n \nm\n \nmol mol\n \n-\n \n1\n \n. All\nleaves were allowed 60 min in the cuvette in order to sta-\nbilize gas exchange and for the cuvette environment to\nequilibrate prior to sampling. Eight leaves were sampled in\nthis way from the control site and 10 leaves from the Bos-\nsoleto site. These experiments were made during Septem-\nber 2001.\n \nSystem II\n \nThe Li-Cor 6400 portable system was also used to control\nenvironmental parameters and monitor gas exchange by\n \nPhragmites\n \n leaves at the control site and at the Bossoleto\nsite. Leaf samples and environmental settings were chosen\nas for the CIRAS system. The only differences were that:\n(1) the cuvette allowed measurement of gas exchange on a\nfixed leaf area of 5 cm\n \n2\n \n; and (b) the CO\n \n2\n \n concentration for\nplants in the Bossoleto spring was set at double that of the\ncontrol site (700 and 350 \n \nm\n \nmol mol\n \n-\n \n1\n \n, respectively). One of\n Isoprene emission from Phragmites australis at elevated CO2 395\n\u00a9 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Plant, Cell and Environment, 27, 393\u2013401\nthe experiments was performed by rapidly switching CO2\nconcentration from the growth concentration to the con-\ncentration experienced by the other stand, without stabiliz-\ning leaves at the new conditions. In another experiment,\nemission measurements were also made at varying vertical\ndistances from the bottom of the Bossoleto spring and in\nthis case the leaf was maintained at the CO2 concentration\nactually monitored in the air at the time of the measure-\nment. Measurements were made during July 2001.\nIsoprene sampling and detection\nSystem I: off-site isoprene analysis\nWhen other gas-exchange parameters (i.e. photosynthesis\nand transpiration rates) were stable, isoprene was collected\nvia a \u2018T\u2019 piece in the return airflow from the cuvette to the\nCIRAS-1 onto dual-bed adsorption-traps, containing Tenax\nTA and Carbotrap (100 mg of each; Supelco, Bellefonte,\nUSA) packed into stainless steel tubes. Air was drawn from\nthe cuvette at a rate of 200 mL min-1 for a period of 1 min.\nAirflow was controlled using a mass flow controller (MKS\ntype 1179 A; MKS, Andover, USA). Samples were repli-\ncated five times. After a 15-min period, this process was\nrepeated, giving 10 samples per leaf. Sample tubes, pre-\ncleaned prior to use, were kept at <5 \u221eC until analysis.\nIsoprene peak identification was accomplished with gas\nchromatographic separation and mass selective detection\n(GC\u2013MS). Desorption and analysis of isoprene was carried\nout using a Perkin Elmer ATD400 (Perkin-Elmer, Nor-\nwalk, CT, USA) connected by a thermal transfer line main-\ntained at 200 \u221eC to a Hewlett-Packard 5890 A gas\nchromatograph with a Hewlett Packard 5970 mass selective\ndetector (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The pre-\nconcentrated samples were thermally desorbed at 280 \u221eC\nfor 6 min at 30 mL min-1 onto a Tenax TA cold trap main-\ntained at -30 \u221eC. Secondary desorption was at 250 \u221eC for\n5 min. A fused silica capillary (50 m \u00a5 0.32 mm inside diam-\neter coated with Al2O3\/KCl) PLOT column was used to\ndetect and quantify isoprene. An initial oven temperature\nof 120 \u221eC was maintained for 1 min, then increased to\n165 \u221eC  at  3 \u221eC min-1  followed  by  an  increase  at  45 \u221eC\nmin-1 to 200 \u221eC for 10 min. The isoprene peak quantifica-\ntion was accomplished using a thermal desorption system\n(Perkin Elmer ATD400) connected to a Perkin Elmer gas\nchromatograph (GC) Autosystem configured with a flame\nionization detector and PLOT column. Column and tube\ndesorption conditions were as described above for the GC-\nMS. The limit of detection for isoprene was approximately\n0.1 ng on column.\nSystem II: on-site isoprene analysis\nIsoprene emission was measured by diverting a small part\n(40 mL) of the air exiting the cuvette from the cuvette\noutflow normally used to match the two infrared gas anal-\nysers (IRGAs) of the system directly into a portable GC\n(Syntech GC855 series 600; Syntech, Groningen, The Neth-\nerlands) placed near to the gas-exchange system. The air\nwas pumped into the GC via a Graphite-Tenax (60\u201380\nmesh, 8 cm) trap, desorbed at 240 \u221eC, transferred to a 13-\nm capillary column (indide diameter 0.53 mm, packed with\n95% dimethylpolysiloxane, 5% diphenylpolysiloxane)\nunder a flow of pure N2, and the isoprene present was\ndetected after 6 min by photoionization (PID at 10.6 eV).\nThe GC was calibrated with several concentrations of gas-\neous isoprene. Additional comparisons were performed\nwith simultaneous measurements of isoprene trapped in\ncarbon cartridges and analysed by GC-MS (see Rapparini\net al. 2004).\nChlorophyll fluorescence analysis\nThe ratio between variable and maximal fluorescence (Fv\/\nFm) was measured in dark-adapted (60 min) leaves with a\nplant efficiency analyser (PEA, v2.05; Hansatech Instru-\nments Ltd, Kings Lynn, Norfolk, UK). When using the\nsystem II, chlorophyll fluorescence was measured with a\nMini-PAM (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) modulated fluo-\nrometer, as explained in detail by Loreto & Delfine (2000).\nBriefly, the fluorescence probe was inserted in the middle\nof the LED arrays with the tip reaching the upper window\nof the gas-exchange cuvette. The non-photochemical\nquenching of fluorescence was calculated from the maximal\nand minimal fluorescence in dark-adapted and illuminated\nleaves, according to Van Kooten & Snel 1990).\nMacro-elemental analysis\nLeaf samples were dried and sealed inside bags and\nbrought back to the Lancaster laboratory for carbon and\nnitrogen analysis. Leaves were dried for a further 3 d at\n40 \u221eC. They were then weighed, and ground in liquid nitro-\ngen in a pestle and mortar. Approximately 400 mg of leaf\nwas then sealed inside a tin capsule for flash combustion on\na Carlo Erba EA1108 elemental analyser (Carlo Erba,\nMilan, Italy). Data were analysed using SPSS V 10.0.4\n(SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).\nBiochemical analyses\nDestructive samplings were carried out at the control site\nand the Bossoleto site to analyse biochemical and photo-\nchemical properties of the Phragmites leaves. Sampling in\nthe Bossoleto was carried out at midday and at the bottom\nof the spring. Samples for determination of isoprene syn-\nthase (IsoS) activity were also collected in the main station\non the slope of the spring, about 25 m from the vents.\nWhole leaves were cut and rapidly frozen under liquid\nnitrogen. Leaves were stored at -80 \u221eC until processed.\nHydrogen peroxide content was determined according to\nVelikova, Yordanov & Edreva (2000). Leaf tissues (0.07 g)\nwere homogenized in an ice bath with 5 mL 0.1% (w\/v)\ntrichloroacetic acid. The homogenate was centrifuged at\n12 000 g for 15 min and 0.5 mL of the supernatant was\nadded to 0.5 mL 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer\n(pH 7.0) and 1 mL 1 M KI. The absorbance of the superna-\n396 P. A. Scholefield et al.\n\u00a9 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Plant, Cell and Environment, 27, 393\u2013401\ntant was measured at 390 nm. The content of H2O2 was\ncalculated by comparison with a standard calibration curve\npreviously made by using different concentrations of H2O2.\nPigment contents (chlorophylls and xanthophylls) were\nmeasured by high performance liquid chromatography on\n3 cm2 leaf discs, as outlined by Brugnoli et al. (1994). The\nde-epoxidation status of xanthophylls was calculated as the\nratio between zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin and the sum of\nzeaxanthin, antheraxanthin and violaxanthin.\nIsoprene synthase analysis\nPhragmites leaves were homogenized with a mortar and\npestle in liquid N2. All further steps were performed at 0\u2013\n4 \u221eC. The fine leaf powder (250 mg fresh weight) was sus-\npended in 5 mL plant extraction buffer (PEB; 100 mM Tris\/\nHCl, pH 7.0, 20 mM MgCl2, 100 mM CaCl2, 5% (v\/v) glyc-\nerol, 0.1% (v\/v) Tween 80, 20 mM dithiothreitol), with\n200 mg  polyvinylpolypirrolidone  added  directly  prior  to\nuse  of  the  buffer,  and  stirred  for  15 min.  The\nhomogenate  was  centrifuged at 18 000 g for 20 min, and\n2.5 mL each of the clear supernatant were desalted on PD-\n10 columns (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany)\nwith IsoS buffer (ISB; Lehning et al. 1999), resulting in a\ntotal of 3.5 mL leaf protein extract. IsoS activity was\nassayed as previously described by Lehning et al. (1999).\nProtein concentrations were determined by the Bradford\nassay with bovine serum albumin as a standard.\nData analysis and statistics\nGas exchange and isoprene emission measurements were\nreplicated on at least three leaves of different plants, and\nbiochemical assays were replicated on five samples. Data\nare shown as means \u00b1 standard errors unless otherwise\nnoted. Mean separation and statistical differences between\ntreatments (ambient versus elevated CO2) were assessed\nwith ANOVA using a Duncan\u2019s test and differences statisti-\ncally significant at P < 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01, are shown by *,\n** and ***, respectively, when comparing two means. Dif-\nferences at P < 0.05 are shown by different letters when\ncomparing several means (see Fig. 4).\nRESULTS\nSystem I\nThe basal emission of isoprene was higher in Phragmites\nplants growing at ambient CO2 at the control site than in\nFigure 1. Isoprene emission rates expressed in terms of (a) leaf \narea basis, and (b) leaf nitrogen, (c) photosynthesis, and (d) per-\ncentage of photosynthetically fixed carbon emitted as isoprene for \nPhragmites leaves grown in the Bossoleto site at elevated CO2 \n(black bars) and in the control site at ambient CO2 (white bars). \nMean \u00b1 SE, (n = 5) is reported and asterisks represent statistical \nsignificance of mean separation at P < 0.01 (***) or P < 0.05 (**) \nlevel.\nIsoprene emission from Phragmites australis at elevated CO2 397\n\u00a9 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Plant, Cell and Environment, 27, 393\u2013401\nthose growing at elevated CO2 in the Bossoleto site (Fig. 1).\nThis difference was found whether we expressed the emis-\nsion rate on the basis of leaf area (Fig. 1a), or dry weight\n(not shown) or leaf nitrogen (Fig. 1b). However, the inhi-\nbition of isoprene emission was attenuated (and became\nnot statistically significant) when expressed on a nitrogen\nbasis. Photosynthesis was not significantly different in the\nplants grown at the Bossoleto spring relative to the control\nsite (Fig. 1c).\nLeaf nitrogen content was generally lower in plants\ngrowing in the Bossoleto site than in those of the control\nsite. For plants of the Bossoleto site isoprene emission\nshowed a good correlation with leaf nitrogen content\n(r2 = 0.67), whereas this correlation was not found at the\ncontrol site (Fig. 2). Expressed as a fraction of the carbon\nassimilated, isoprene emissions at the control site were\n0.66 \u00b1 0.03%. At the elevated CO2 site, isoprene emissions\nwere 0.45 \u00b1 0.03% of the assimilated C. The difference is\nsignificant at the P < 0.05 level (Fig. 1d)\nIsoprene emissions were measured at five sampling sta-\ntions of the Bossoleto site as mentioned previously, with\ntypically two plants sampled at each sampling station.\nThere was a clear increase of the emission with increasing\ndistances from the vent and with decreasing average CO2\nconcentration (Fig. 3). This was also confirmed by the\nexperiment made with on-site, on-line analysis (see below).\nSystem II\nIsoprene emission was also measured with a portable gas-\nchromatograph at different distances from the CO2 vent. In\nFig. 4b, the emission of isoprene is plotted versus three\ndifferent vertical distances from the vent. Also this set of\nmeasurements indicates that the emission of isoprene is\nreduced in the Bossoleto site with respect to the control site\nand that this reduction is stronger when plants are grown\nat increasingly high CO2 concentration. In contrast, mea-\nsurements of photosynthesis do not show any significant\nchange of the rate of CO2 fixation dependent on the con-\ncentration of CO2, although a small reduction of photosyn-\nthesis was observed at the bottom of the spring (Fig. 4a).\nIn a second experiment, we rapidly switched the CO2\nconcentration of the air flowing over the leaf in the gas-\nexchange cuvette and recorded immediate changes in iso-\nprene emission rate, while photosynthesis and stomatal\nconductance were recorded 1 h after the switch. In the Bos-\nsoleto spring, a rapid switch from elevated to ambient CO2\ninduced a progressive increase in isoprene emission\n(Fig. 5a). In the control site, a rapid switch from ambient to\nelevated CO2 caused a rapid reduction of the emission.\nSwitching back to ambient CO2 again increased isoprene\nemission although the emission did not reach the same\nelevated level recorded at the beginning of the experiment\n(Fig. 5b).\nIn a third experiment, we wanted to see if isoprene basal\nemission of Phragmites leaves growing at elevated CO2 was\nstable during the day. Measurements repeated in the morn-\ning, at midday and in the afternoon showed a distinct daily\nchange for both isoprene basal emission and photosynthe-\nsis, but the change was opposite for the two parameters,\nwith isoprene emission reaching its maximum during the\ncentral hours of the day, when photosynthesis was at its\nminimum (Fig. 6).\nDestructive samplings: photochemical, \nbiochemical and enzymological parameters\nPhysiological, in vivo measurements were supported by\nanalytical assays of the photochemical, biochemical and\nenzymological properties of the Phragmites stands growing\nat elevated and ambient CO2. These measurements\nrevealed no significant differences attributable to CO2 in\nFigure 2.

Each data point is an average \nof five measurements on different leaves and error bars represent \nSE. Linear regression lines and regression coefficients for the two \ndata-sets are also shown.\nFigure 3.

The enzyme activity\nwas clearly reduced in leaves exposed to elevated CO2 with\nrespect to control and the reduction was strongest in leaves\ngrowing at the bottom of the spring, where an extremely\nelevated CO2 concentration was experienced by plants for\nmost of the day (Fig. 7a) The reduction of IsoS correlated\nwith the reduction of isoprene emission at increasing CO2\nlevels (Fig. 7b).\nDISCUSSION\nField experiments conducted by two different groups using\ntwo different analytical instruments show that isoprene\nbasal emission is significantly depressed in Phragmites\nplants grown at elevated CO2 when compared with plants\ngrowing at the control site. Emission rates measured using\nsystem I and the off-site analysis of isoprene were slightly\nhigher than those measured using system II and the on-site\nanalysis, but in both data-sets the emissions of control\nplants exceeded the emission of plants growing in the\nBossoleto.\nAn even stronger evidence of the inhibitory effect of\nelevated CO2 on isoprene emission was given by measure-\nments at different distance from the CO2 vent in the Bos-\nsoleto spring. The isoprene emission by peripheral stands\nof Phragmites was higher than the emission of plants grow-\ning at the bottom of the spring. This presumably correlated\ninversely with the average CO2 concentration at which\nplants were grown. Access to the bottom of the spring was\nprevented by the extremely high CO2 concentration early\nin the morning and late in the evening (see cover picture\nof the spring). Van Gardingen et al. (1995) showed that the\neffective mean CO2 concentration, i.e. mean CO2 exposure\nduring photosynthesis, integrated over a plant\u2019s lifetime,\ncorrelates with displacement from the main CO2 vent. It is\ntherefore reasonable to use distance from the vents at the\nbottom of the spring as a proxy for effective average CO2\nconcentration. The same authors concluded that the bottom\nFigure 4.

Single leaf measurements are shown as \nrepresentative of the experiment which was replicated five times.\nIsoprene emission from Phragmites australis at elevated CO2 399\n\u00a9 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Plant, Cell and Environment, 27, 393\u2013401\nof the spring exhibits a CO2 concentration averaged over\nthe day of approximately 900\u20131100 mmol mol-1, compared\nto peripheral concentrations of 700 mmol mol-1. Phragmites\nplants at the peripheral stations thus grow under CO2 con-\ncentrations that are both physiologically relevant and\nwithin the range of future predicted concentrations and are\nthe most relevant to studies related to global change.\nA negative effect of elevated CO2 on isoprene emission\nhas been often reported in laboratory studies (e.g. Loreto\n& Sharkey 1990; for plants exposed to elevated CO2, and\nSharkey et al. (1991) for plants grown at elevated CO2 in\ngrowth cabinets, but see also contrasting results reported in\nthe latter paper for different plant species). Results from\nfield studies are very complex to interpret. Isoprene emis-\nsion was reported to be higher in Quercus pubescens leaves\ngrown at elevated CO2 in the Bossoleto spring than in\nleaves of plants growing in a control site at ambient CO2\n(Tognetti et al. 1998), whereas experiments on a FACE\nfacility did not show any effect of CO2 on the emission of\npoplar clones (Loreto et al. 2001a) and recent experiments\non controlled mesocosms indicated a clear inhibition of\nisoprene emission in poplar plants grown at elevated CO2\n(Rosenstiel et al. 2003). Isoprenoids more complex than\nisoprene can be emitted by Mediterranean oaks in an iso-\nprene-like manner (Loreto et al. 1996). Two field experi-\nments were made on Quercus ilex grown at elevated CO2\nand came to opposite conclusions, indicating inhibition\n(Loreto et al. 2001b) or stimulation (Staudt et al. 2001) of\nthe emission of monoterpenes in elevated CO2 with respect\nto ambient CO2.\nTo better understand the causes of the observed CO2-\ndependent inhibition of isoprene emission in Phragmites\nleaves, we carried out physiological and biochemical anal-\nyses regarding carbon metabolism components. CO2-\ndependent differences of isoprene basal emission were not\nassociated with changes in photosynthesis, indicating that\nthe amount of fixed carbon was not limiting isoprene for-\nmation and emission at elevated CO2. This observation also\nindicates that a different fraction of the fixed carbon was\ndiverted into the isoprene biosynthetic pathway at the two\nCO2 concentrations. Only at the bottom of the spring,\nwhere plants experienced very high CO2 concentrations for\npart of the day, was photosynthesis slightly reduced. This\nreduction was not related to a reduction of chlorophyll but\nmay have been caused by the consistent reduction in leaf\nnitrogen generally found in the Bossoleto spring.\nInterestingly, leaf nitrogen reduction in the Bossoleto\nwas also associated with a reduction in the rate of isoprene\nFigure 6. Diurnal trend of basal emission of photosynthesis (a) \nand isoprene (b) from Phragmites leaves. Measurements taken in \nthe Bossoleto site during July 2001. Means \u00b1 SE, (n = 3) are shown. \nWhen measurements during the day were statistically different at \nP < 0.05 level, bars are labelled with different letters.\nFigure 7.

Scholefield et al.\n\u00a9 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Plant, Cell and Environment, 27, 393\u2013401\nemission. This suggests that nitrogen may be a regulating\nfactor for isoprene formation. There have been reports that\nisoprene emission is related to nitrogen fertilization in pop-\nlar plants (Litvak et al. 1996) and that low nitrogen can limit\nthe formation of other antioxidants Logan et al. 1999). Low\nnitrogen can limit the formation of nitrogen-rich molecules\nsuch as enzymes. Enzymological analysis revealed a pro-\ngressive decrease of isoprene synthase activity at increasing\nlevel of CO2. However, since the amount of soluble protein\nin the leaves from the different sampling sites are quite\nsimilar (data not shown), the observed levels of IsoS activ-\nity apparently are not reduced by a direct nitrogen limita-\ntion. A more likely explanation might be that enhanced\nCO2 led to a reduced substrate availability (Rosenstiel et al.\n2003) as a result of a metabolic competition for phosphoe-\nnolpyruvate. A similar negative CO2 effect on isoprenoid-\nforming enzymes result was observed by Loreto et al.\n(2001b) in a study on Quercus ilex plants growing in open\ntop chambers at different CO2 concentrations. In plants\ngrowing at elevated CO2, monoterpene synthase activities\nwere significantly lower than in plants growing at ambient\nCO2. Our result suggests that elevated CO2 generally inhib-\nits the expression of isoprenoid synthesis genes and iso-\nprene synthase activity which may, in turn, limit formation\nof every chloroplast-derived isoprenoid.\nWe found that rapid switches from elevated to ambient\nCO2 caused an immediate and steady increase in the emis-\nsion for about 1 h. On the other hand, rapid switches from\nambient to elevated CO2 reduced the emission in less than\n30 min. Interestingly, switching back to ambient CO2\ncaused a partial recovery of the original emission at ambi-\nent CO2. We interpret the velocity of the observed changes\nin isoprene emission after switching CO2 as inconsistent\nwith changes of nitrogen metabolism. Fast changes may\nhowever, be consistent with post-translational modification\nof enzymes operating in the biosynthetic pathway of iso-\nprene formation, including IsoS, or to the availability of the\nisoprene precursor dimetylallylpyrophosphate (DMAPP),\nwhose content has been shown to rapidly drop under ele-\nvated CO2 (Rosenstiel et al. 2003). The response of isoprene\nemission to rapid switches of CO2 was consistent with that\nobserved in the stands permanently growing at ambient or\nelevated CO2, namely, elevated CO2 reduced isoprene\nemission. This suggests that other possible differences\nbetween the two sites (either in the genetics of the two\npopulations or in the growth conditions) did not relevantly\naffect our experiments. However, as the spring environ-\nment is somewhat unique and difficult to replicate, we can-\nnot exclude altogether that other environmental factors\ncould also have somehow influenced the observed\nresponses during our experiments.\nThere is growing evidence that basal emission of iso-\nprenoids is not constant during the season (Lehning et al.\n2001; Fischbach et al. 2002) and may also change during the\nday (Rapparini et al. 2004). We have seen a strong daily\nchange of isoprene emission by Phragmites plants growing\nin the spring, with the emission peaking during the central\nhours of the day, in coincidence with a depression of pho-\ntosynthesis. The daily trend observed in isoprene emission\nrate should not be directly attributed to changes of temper-\nature and light intensity since basal emission is measured\nwhile maintaining these parameters at constant levels. We\nhypothesize that isoprene basal emission rate responds to\nthe temperature contemporaneously experienced by other\nparts of the plants or by the whole stand of Phragmites.\nThis explains why the emission is highest during the hottest\nhours of the day. Furthermore, the drop in CO2 concentra-\ntion occurring during the central hours of the day inside the\nspring may explain the observed increase in the emission\nof isoprene. The emission becomes low again when CO2\nstarts to build-up at very elevated levels such as during the\nevening. If one (or both) explanations are valid, then basal\nemissions recorded under environmental conditions far\ndifferent  than  those  set  for  the  leaf  may  not  be adequate\nto correctly estimate emissions at the leaf or canopy level\nwith current algorithms (Guenther et al. 1993, 1995). In any\ncase the basal emission cannot be regarded as a fixed factor\neven for the same leaf and may need to be corrected for a\nseries of variables perhaps including past temperatures\n(Sharkey & Yeh 2001), plant stand temperatures, and CO2\nconcentration.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nSebastiano Delfine, Fabrizio Pietrini, Giuseppe Santarelli\nand Daniela Stella helped with field measurements during\nthe different measurement sessions.
