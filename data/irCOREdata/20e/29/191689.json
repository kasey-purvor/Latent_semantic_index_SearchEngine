Conclusions \nAcknowledgements \nReferences \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\n1.  Intoduction \n \nBase excision repair (BER) is the major system responsible for the removal of corrupt \nDNA bases and repair of DNA single strand breaks generated spontaneously and induced \nby exogenous DNA damaging factors, including ionizing radiation and alkylating agents \nthat are frequently used in cancer therapy (reviewed in (Dianov et al., 2001; Fortini and \nDogliotti, 2007; Lindahl, 1993; Lindahl and Wood, 1999; Weinfeld, 2001).  Excision \nrepair of damaged bases is initiated by specific DNA glycosylases that recognize and \nremove the damaged base by hydrolyzing the glycosylic bond linking the base residue to \nthe DNA sugar phosphate backbone (Fig. 1).  The abasic site (AP site) is further \nrecognized by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) that introduces a DNA single strand break \n(SSB) by cleaving the phosphodiester bond 5\u2032 to the AP site generating a SSB containing \na 5\u2032-sugar phosphate.  At this point, BER and SSB repair mechanisms are very similar. \nPoly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP-1) temporarily binds to both SSBs induced by \nDNA damaging agents and repair intermediates arising during BER.  Although the exact \nrole of PARP-1 binding to the SSBs is unclear, it has been proposed that PARP-1 binding \nprotects strand breaks from degradation by cellular nucleases where the amount of \ndamage outstrips the repair capacity of the cell (Parsons et al., 2005a; Satoh and Lindahl, \n1992).  Following NAD+-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1, automodified \nPARP-1 then dissociates from DNA.  If enough BER enzymes are present after release of \nPARP-1, repair proceeds by virtue of end-processors that removing moieties blocking \nDNA repair synthesis and DNA ligation. DNA polymerase \u03b2, polynucleotide kinase, \nAPE1 and aprataxin are the major players involved in processing of modified 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 -\nends. After restoring conventional 3\u2032 -hydroxyl and 5\u2032-phosphate strand break ends, repair \nis accomplished by DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol \u03b2) and the DNA ligase III\u03b1-XRCC1 \nheterodimer.  Pol \u03b2 adds one nucleotide to the 3\u2032-OH end of the strand break, thus filling \nthe one nucleotide gap created during repair, while DNA ligase seals the DNA ends thus \ncompleting the repair process (Fig. 1).   \nThe minor BER pathway, also known as long-patch repair (Frosina et al., 1996), \ninvolves flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), \n 4\nreplication factor C (RFC), DNA polymerase \u03b4\/ \u03b5 and DNA ligase I in addition to DNA \nglycosylase and AP endonuclease (Klungland and Lindahl, 1997b; Pascucci et al., 1999) .  \nLong-patch BER acts to repair AP sites at which the sugar residue has been modified in \nsome way, e.g. oxidised or reduced (Klungland and Lindahl, 1997b; Matsumoto and \nKim, 1995b). The AP lyase activity of Pol \u03b2 is inactive at such AP sites, therefore to \ninitiate this pathway, DNA polymerase \u03b2 first adds one nucleotide to the 3\u2019 end of the \nnick and than DNA polymerase \u03b4 or \u03b5 add a few more nucleotides to generate part of a \nsingle-stranded flap structure containing a 5' sugar phosphate (Podlutsky et al., 2001a).  \nThis flap is recognised and excised by FEN1, which tracks down the length of the flap to \ncleave at the single-strand\/double-strand junction, and the DNA is finally ligated by DNA \nligase I; in this reaction, FEN1 activity is stimulated by PCNA (Klungland and Lindahl, \n1997a).  Alternatively, long-patch repair can also be catalysed by Pol \u03b4 plus PCNA.  \nLong-patch repair events result in a 2-5 nucleotide repair patch (Klungland and Lindahl, \n1997b). Since long-patch repair appears to be a relatively minor contributor to all BER \nactivity (reviewed in Sung and Demple 2006), this essay will focus on short-patch repair \npathway in mammalian cells.    \n \n2.  Base excision repair proteins \n2.1 DNA glycosylases \nDNA glycosylases initiate the BER process by catalyzing hydrolysis of the C1'-N \nglycosylic bond to the damaged base, removing the base and leaving behind an abasic \n(AP) site.  The ubiquity and wide utility of the glycosylase family reflects the essential \nrole of the BER process in protecting genome stability.  Eleven DNA glycosylases have \nso far been implicated in mammalian BER, and their various specificities are \nsummarized in Table 1.   Two mechanistic classes of DNA glycosylases are recognized: \n 5\nmono-functional (i.e. glycosylase activity only) such as UDG, and bi-functional (i.e. \nglycosylase and \u03b2-lyase activities) such as human 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine-DNA \nglycosylase (hOGG1).  Mono-functional DNA glycosylases create AP sites through \ncleavage of the C1\u2019-N-glycosylic bond using an activated water molecule as an active \nsite nucleophile (McCullough et al., 1999).  Additionally, bi-functional glycosylases \nhave an associated AP lyase activity which can further process the AP site by incising the \nDNA backbone 3' to the AP site.   \n \n2.2 AP Endonucleases \nRemoval of damaged bases from DNA by DNA glycosylases leads to the formation of \nAP sites.  A critical step in the BER pathway involves the cleavage of baseless sites in \nDNA by an AP endonuclease.  The major AP endonuclease in mammalian cells is APE1, \nalso known as Ref1 or HAP1, an enzyme that is homologous to bacterial exonuclease III \n(Demple et al., 1991; Robson and Hickson, 1991).  APE1 is a multifunctional protein \nthat is not only responsible for repair of AP sites, but it also functions as a reduction-\noxidation (redox) factor maintaining transcription factors in an active reduced state; it has \nalso been shown to be closely linked with cellular apoptosis (Reviewed in (Evans et al., \n2000; Wilson and Barsky, 2001)).  The functional importance of APE1 is underscored by \nthe findings that mice nullizygous for the APE1 gene are embryonic lethal \n(Xanthoudakis et al., 1996)  and that downregulation of APE1 levels in human cells \nusing RNAi leads to accumulation of AP sites, halted cell proliferation and triggering of \napoptosis (Fung and Demple, 2005).   \nAPE1 is the major human AP endonuclease that comprises more than 95% of \ncellular AP site incision activity (Chen et al., 1991).  APE1 cleaves phosphodiester bonds \nhydrolytically in a Mg2+-dependent manner, leaving a 3'-hydroxyl group and a 5'-\ndeoxyribose phosphate (dRP) group flanking the nucleotide gap.  In addition to AP \nendonuclease activity, APE1 has 3'-diesterase and phosphatase activity, although its \nphosphatase activity is approximately 100-fold lower than its AP endonuclease activity \n(Chen et al., 1991; Wilson and Barsky, 2001) and is most probably of limited \nphysiological relevance (Wiederhold et al., 2004).  Notably, it has recently been \ndemonstrated that APE1 is the major activity in human cells responsible for removal of \n 6\n3'-phosphoglycolate or 8-oxoguanine that occur at SSBs created by ionizing irradiation \nand oxidative agents  (Parsons et al., 2004; Parsons et al., 2005b).  Although APE1 \nexpression is ubiquitous, it exhibits a complex and heterogeneous staining pattern that \ndiffers among tissue types and even differs between neighboring cells (Rivkees and \nKelley, 1994; Wilson et al., 1996).  As expected, APE1 is found in the nucleus of cells, \nin a fashion which corresponds to its repair functions.  In some cell types, however, \nAPE1 is also found in the cytoplasm and mitochondria (Tell et al., 2001), which may \ncorrespond either to its role as a DNA repair protein in the mitochondria (Sawyer and \nVan Houten, 1999) or, through its redox activity in maintaining newly synthesized \ntranscription factors in a reduced state during transportation to the nucleus (Evans et al., \n2000; Kakolyris, 1998). \nMammals also possess a second protein (APE2) with sequence homology to \nexonuclease III, but this protein exhibits comparatively weak AP site-specific and 3'-\nnuclease activities (Hadi et al., 2002). \n \n2.3 Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase \nThe enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) has been strongly implicated in \nBER although its precise role is not yet fully understood.  Poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase-\n1 (PARP-1) has a very high affinity for strand breaks and it is generally though to bind \nincised AP sites before any other repair proteins (Parsons et al., 2005a).  The binding of \nstrand breaks allosterically activates PARP-1\u2019s catalytic activity, modifying nuclear \nproteins with polymers of ADP-ribose that it synthesises from NAD+ (see (Ame et al., \n2004; Herceg and Wang, 2001; Smith, 2001) for review).  One of the major targets of \npoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is PARP-1 itself and the resulting accumulation of negative \ncharge on the enzyme reduces its affinity for DNA via electrostatic repulsion.  As a \nresult, single strand break repair exhibits a dependence on NAD+ due to the activity of \nPARP-1 (Satoh and Lindahl, 1992; Satoh et al., 1993).  Similarly, the repair of damaged \nDNA bases via BER also exhibits a dependence on NAD+ (Allinson et al., 2003).  \nInhibition of PARP-1 catalysis in cultured cells, by the use of either chemical inhibitors \nor expression of the catalytically inactive PARP-1 DNA binding domain, results in \ninhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and a concomitant retardation of strand break repair \n 7\n(Aoufouchi et al., 1999; Molinete et al., 1993; Perkins et al., 2001).  Interestingly, PARP-\n1 null mice are hypersensitive to alkylating agents and ionizing radiation (M\u00e9nessier-de \nMurcia et al., 1997; Wang et al., 1997), and immortalised cells from these animals \nmanifest characteristic features of genomic instability, including delayed rejoining of \nstrand breaks, mixed ploidy and elevated frequencies of SCE and micronuclei formation \nupon treatment with DNA-damaging agents (M\u00e9nessier-de Murcia et al., 1997; Trucco et \nal., 1998; Wang et al., 1997).   \nIt was recently demonstrated that in vitro repair reactions carried out in the \nabsence of PARP-1 result in increased nucleolytic degradation of base excision repair \nintermediates and it has been suggested that PARP-1 functions to protect strand breaks \nand repair intermediates from degradation or recombination where the amount of damage \noutstrips the repair capacity of the cell (Parsons et al., 2005a).  In support of this \nhypothesis, it has recently been reported that the genomes of PARP-1 null mice show an \nincreased incidence of deletion mutations upon DNA damage (Shibata et al., 2005).   \n \n2.4 Polynucleotide Kinase   \nHuman PNK is an important end-processor since it is the principal enzyme involved in \nthe restoration of 5\u2032-phosphate and 3\u2032-hydroxyl ends at SSBs.  Accordingly, human PNK \nhas been cloned and characterized as the major DNA 5\u2032-kinase and 3\u2032-phosphatase that is \nable to phosphorylate the 5'-end of SSBs and removes blocking phosphate lesions from \nthe 3'-end (Jilani et al., 1999; Karimi-Busheri et al., 1999).    In human cells, the \ninvolvement of PNK in the repair of oxidative strand breaks has been revealed by its \ninteraction with components of the BER pathway, namely X-ray cross complementing \nprotein 1 (XRCC1), DNA ligase III\u03b1 and Pol \u03b2 (Whitehouse et al., 2001).   \nRecently, an important role for PNK in SSB repair was revealed by down-\nregulation of human PNK by RNAi silencing: A reduction in the levels of endogenous \nPNK enhanced the spontaneous mutation frequency and caused an elevated sensitivity of \ncells to genotoxic agents (Rasouli-Nia et al., 2004). \n \n2.5 Aprataxin  \n 8\nAprataxin is a member of the HIT domain superfamily of nucleotide \nhydrolases\/transferases (Brenner, 2002; Kijas et al., 2006).  Mutations in the aprataxin \ngene give rise to the neurological disorder ataxia oculomotor apraxia (AOA1) that is \nsimilar to SCAN1 pathology (Date et al., 2004; Moreira et al., 2001).  Aprataxin has been \nfound to interact with XRCC1 (Caldecott, 2003; Date et al., 2004) and cells deficient in \naprataxin are defective in DNA SSB repair (Clements et al., 2004; Gueven et al., 2004).   \nRecently, aprataxin has been found to be involved in the resolution of abortive DNA \nligation intermediates by catalyzing the release of adenylate groups covalently linked to \n5\u2032-phosphate termini at single strand nicks and gaps in DNA.  Based on these data, it was \nproposed that such adenylated 5'-ends are formed as a result of abortive DNA ligation \nduring attempted ligation of SSBs containing \u201cdamaged\u201d unligatable  DNA ends (Ahel et \nal., 2006).   \n \n2.6 BER DNA Polymerases  \nExcision of a damaged base and subsequent processing of the resulting SSB \nresults in an intermediate containing a 3'-hydroxyl, suitable for priming strand resynthesis \nby a polymerase. The majority of BER proceeds through the so-called \u201cshort-patch\u201d sub-\npathway in which a single nucleotide is removed and replaced.  In this pathway, DNA \nresynthesis is carried out by Pol \u03b2, a member of the X family of polymerases (Dianov et \nal., 1992; Sobol et al., 1996; Wiebauer and Jiricny, 1990).  Like other X family \npolymerases, Pol \u03b2 is a compact (39 kDa) single subunit protein. It contains two domains \nconnected by a hinge region: a C-terminal 31 kDa polymerase domain (Kumar et al., \n1990) and an N-terminal 8 kDa dRP lyase domain (Matsumoto and Kim, 1995a), both of \nthese activities are required for short-patch BER (Podlutsky et al., 2001b).  The dRP \nlyase activity of Pol \u03b2 is required for processing the SSB created by APE1 since it \ncontains 5'-dRP residue blocking DNA ligation. Pol \u03b2 first removes the dRP residue \nthrough catalysis of a \u03b2-elimination reaction (Matsumoto and Kim, 1995a) and then fills \ncreated one nucleotide gap.  The two activities of Pol \u03b2 are likely to be tightly \ncoordinated since co-complementation of Pol \u03b2 null cell extracts with both dRP lyase and \npolymerase deficient mutants of Pol \u03b2 is unable to restore single nucleotide patch repair \nto these extracts (Podlutsky et al., 2001b).  Pol \u03b2 lacks any intrinsic proof-reading activity \n 9\nyet carries out DNA synthesis of moderately high fidelity compared to that of the so-\ncalled error-prone polymerases.  The error frequency of short patch base excision repair \nby mammalian cell extracts has been calculated to be of the order of 5 to 10 x 10-4, with \none nucleotide deletions predominating (Bennett et al., 2001; Sanderson and Mosbaugh, \n1998; Zhang and Dianov, 2005).   \nMice nullizygous for the Pol \u03b2 gene are non-viable and die early in \nembryogenesis (Gu et al., 1994).  Embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice are \nhypersensitive to the methylating agent, MMS (Sobol et al., 1996).  As might be \nexpected, under normal circumstances Pol \u03b2 is detectable in all tissues.  It is generally \nfound at low levels, except for testicular tissue in which meiosis is an important \nphysiological process (Hirose et al., 1989).  Pol \u03b2 is expressed constitutively and without \ndemonstrable cell-cycle dependence (Zmudzka et al., 1988).  Levels of Pol \u03b2 are most \nprobably kept low in undamaged cells due to the mis-insertion frequency that is inherent \nto the activity of Pol \u03b2 when one compares it to the replicative polymerases.   \n \n2.7 DNA ligases \nTwo DNA ligases have been implicated in BER: DNA ligase I and DNA ligase III \n(Tomkinson and Levin, 1997).  DNA ligase III is the major DNA ligase involved in \nsingle-nucleotide patch BER.  DNA ligase III exists in the nucleus as two isoforms, \ndenoted DNA ligase III\u03b1 (103 kDa) and DNA ligase III\u03b2 (96 kDa), which arise through \ndifferential splicing of RNA transcripts (Mackey et al., 1997).  DNA ligase III\u03b1 is \nubiquitously expressed in human tissues, whereas DNA ligase III\u03b2 is found only in \ntesticular tissue and is believed to be involved in homologous recombination during \nmeiosis (Tomkinson and Mackey, 1998).  The two isoforms share many features in \ncommon and differ only at their C-termini, with the C-terminal 77 amino acids of DNA \nligase III\u03b1 being replaced with 17 different amino acids in DNA ligase III\u03b2 \uf020(Tomkinson \net al., 2001).   \nDNA ligase III\u03b1 was originally purified in a complex with XRCC1 (Caldecott et \nal., 1994; Caldecott et al., 1995).  This interaction has been characterized in vitro and is \nmediated through the BRCT domain located at the C-terminus of DNA ligase III\u03b1 (Nash \n 10\net al., 1997).  XRCC1 null cell lines have 4-6 fold reduced levels and activity of DNA \nligase III\u03b1, indicating that the XRCC1 protein is important for maintaining cellular level \nof DNA ligase III\u03b1 (Caldecott et al., 1995).  In support of this finding, it has been shown \nthat the activity of DNA ligase III can be restored in mutant XRCC1 cells (EM9) by \ntransfection of the XRCC1 gene product (Ljungquist et al., 1994)).  Since XRCC1 null \ncells are characteristically deficient in short-patch BER, it has been suggested that the \nXRCC1-DNA ligase III\u03b1 complex plays an important role in this sub-pathway (Cappelli \net al., 1997).  \nDNA ligase I (102 kDa) is conserved in all eukaryotes, with orthologs being \nfound in organisms from yeast to mammals (Tomkinson and Mackey, 1998).  It plays an \nessential role in DNA replication (Waga and Stillman, 1998).  Human cell lines \ncontaining a partially inactive DNA ligase I mutant exhibit hypersensitivity to DNA-\ndamaging agents such as ionizing radiation and alkylating agents (Barnes et al., 1992; \nPrigent et al., 1994; Webster et al., 1992), suggesting a role for DNA ligase I in BER.  \nHowever, a mouse model with an identical mutation was defective in DNA replication \nbut not in DNA repair (Harrison et al., 2002).  Despite this controversy, there is abundant \nevidence to suggest the involvement of DNA ligase I in the long-patch pathway of BER \n(DeMott et al., 1998; Dianov et al., 1999; Levin et al., 2000).   \n \n2.8 XRCC1 \nOriginally identified as a result of its absence from a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell \nline (EM9), which showed hypersensitivity to both alkylating agents and ionizing \nradiation (Thompson et al., 1990), XRCC1 has been increasingly implicated as a key \nplayer in the BER process. Cells deficient in XRCC1 show many of the hallmarks of \ndefective BER, including hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and alkylating agents, \ndelayed single strand break rejoining and increased rates of sister chromatid exchange \n(SCE) and induced mutations (reviewed in (Thompson and West, 2000)).  Extracts from \nsuch cells show a partial defect in BER efficiency when compared to wild type cells \n(Cappelli et al., 1997; Sleeth et al., 2004).  The importance of the XRCC1 gene for \ncellular functioning is underlined by the fact that its targeted knockout results in \n 11\nembryonic lethality (Tebbs et al., 1999).  Although it has no known enzymatic function \nof its own, XRCC1 interacts with a number of enzymes involved in BER, including DNA \nligase III\u03b1 (Caldecott et al., 1994; Nash et al., 1997), Pol \u03b2 \uf020\uf020(Caldecott et al., 1996; Kubota \net al., 1996), PARP-1 (Caldecott et al., 1996; Masson et al., 1998), APE1 (Vidal et al., \n2001) and PCNA (Fan et al., 2004). \nXRCC1 is a 69.5 kDa multi-domain protein with an N-terminal DNA binding \ndomain and two BRCT motifs.  The first BRCT motif, BRCT I, is the site of interaction \nwith PARP-1 (Masson et al., 1998), while the C-terminal BRCT motif (BRCT II) is \nresponsible for the interaction with DNA ligase III\u03b1 (Nash et al., 1997).  Mutations in the \nBRCT domains of XRCC1 seriously compromise single-strand break repair (SSBR) in \nvivo, but with differing cell cycle dependencies.  The BRCT II domain seems to be \nrequired only for SSBR during the G \/G0 1 phase of the cell cycle with SSBR being \nunaffected in S phase (Taylor et al., 2000).  Disruption of this domain affects the survival \nof quiescent cells only: cycling cells with a mutated BRCT II domain show similar repair \nefficiencies and survival to those with normal XRCC1 (Moore et al., 2000).  Conversely, \nthe BRCT I domain is required for SSBR in both G  and S\/G1 2 (Taylor et al., 2002) and \ndisruption of this domain compromises cells\u2019 ability to reinitiate DNA synthesis \nfollowing exposure to an alkylating agent (Kubota and Horiuchi, 2003). \nThe nick-binding N-terminal domain of XRCC1 interacts with the palm-thumb \ndomain of Pol \u03b2 allowing it to form a tertiary complex with Pol \u03b2 and nicked DNA, in \nwhich both proteins almost completely surround the nicked site (Gryk et al., 2002; \nMarintchev et al., 1999; Marintchev et al., 2000).  The biological importance of the \nXRCC1-Pol \u03b2 interaction was recently confirmed when a mutant of XRCC1 incapable of \ninteraction with Pol \u03b2 was unable to fully reverse the hydrogen peroxide hypersensitivity \nof an XRCC1 deficient cell line and was less efficient at performing the ligation step in \nreconstituted repair reactions (Dianova et al., 2004). \n \n3. Links with Cancer \nAs discussed above, BER is a highly coordinated cellular biochemical system in which \nprotein-DNA and protein-protein interactions play essential roles.  It is likely that there \n 12\nexists a fine balance between the concentrations of the enzymes involved in the BER \npathway (Glassner et al., 1998).  Significant under-expression of a BER enzyme may \nresult in attenuation of repair efficiency as the dynamics of the pathway would alter and \nthe under-expressed enzyme may then become rate-limiting.  The consequences for a cell \nmay depend on the abundance of backup repair proteins (see below).  If the repair \ncapacity of BER is reduced, base damage may accumulate in DNA resulting in genomic \ninstability or apoptosis.  Alternatively, and probably more commonly in cancer, over-\nexpression of a BER enzyme may have effects in the cell such as genomic instability or \nincreased translesion synthesis (see below).  In this section, the effects of imbalances in \nDNA repair activities will be reviewed with particular reference to their potential \ncontributions to carcinogenesis. \n \n3.1 DNA Glycosylases \nDNA glycosylases which recognise DNA lesions and initiate BER have overlapping \nfunctions, which permit backup mechanisms to exist if the function of one DNA \nglycosylase is lost.  Compatible with this statement, mouse knockout models have been \nconstructed for AAG (Engelward et al., 1997; Hang et al., 1997), OGG1 (Klungland et \nal., 1999; Minowa et al., 2000), UNG2 (Nilsen et al., 2000), NTH1 (Elder and Dianov, \n2002; Ocampo et al., 2002; Takao et al., 2002),  MBD4 (Millar et al., 2002) and MYH \nDNA glycosylases (Xie et al., 2004), which have proven invaluable in furthering \nunderstanding of BER in vivo.  Perhaps surprisingly, only in the OGG1 knockout mice \nhas there been shown to be significant accumulation of the oxidised base, 8-oxo-guanine; \nan observation made in tissues of older animals compared to wild-type mice (Klungland \net al., 1999; Minowa et al., 2000).   \nThe predisposition of OGG1 -\/- mice to develop cancer is demonstrated by the \nincidence of lung cancer in mice aged 18 months (Sakumi et al., 2003).  The fact that \nmice do not develop cancer until old age is likely to represent some degree of protection \nconferred by the existence of backup pathways such as NEIL1 and NEIL2 DNA \nglycosylases.  Despite this protection, OGG1 -\/- mice do have accelerated rates of \nmutations in response to mutagens such as cigarette smoke and premature senescence of \ncells, the latter being particularly apparent in mitochondrial DNA (de Souza-Pinto et al., \n 13\n2001).  Mitochondrial DNA is more susceptible to the damaging effects of reactive \noxygen species since it lacks the relative protection of histones.  Compared to the \npredisposition to develop lung cancer in old age in OGG1 -\/- mice, a much earlier \npredisposition to both lung cancer and ovarian cancer is observed in mice which possess \nknockouts for both OGG1 and MYH (Xie et al., 2004).  In this study, G to T \ntransversions were observed in the K-ras gene of affected animals, a mutation that has \nbeen detected in several human cancers (Friday and Adjei, 2005). \nResults regarding potential links between genetic polymorphisms of BER genes \nand cancer risk have been inconsistent and definite conclusions cannot be drawn.  In a \nuseful meta-analysis performed by Hung and colleagues using 3,253 cases and 3,371 \ncontrols from seven studies and focusing on OGG1, APE1 and XRCC1, increased lung \ncancer risk was found in subjects carrying the OGG1 Cys\/Cys genotype (odds ratio (OR) \n= 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.53) (Hung et al., 2005).  They also found a \nprotective effect of the XRCC1 194Trp allele for tobacco-related cancers (OR = 0.86, \n95% CI: 0.77, 0.95) using 4,895 cases and 5,977 controls from 16 studies.  The XRCC1 \n399Gln\/399Gln genotype was associated with increased risk of tobacco-related cancers \namong light smokers (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.94) but decreased risk among heavy \nsmokers (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.99), suggesting effect modification by tobacco \nsmoking. Some of these data are supported by experimental evidence that certain \nisoforms of these gene products exhibit decreased enzymatic activity or lower mutagen \nsensitivity in animal models (reviewed in (Hecht, 1999)).  \n The first demonstration of a link between an inherited disorder involving BER \nand human carcinogenesis is the monofunctional DNA glycosylase, hMYH, which \nremoves A that is misincorporated opposite 8-oxoguanine, hence preventing formation of \nG:C to T:A transversions.  In a seminal study, the autosomal recessive syndrome of \nadenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which confers a 100% lifetime risk of colorectal \ncancer unless the organ is surgically removed, was linked with biallelic mutations in \nhMYH (Jones et al., 2002).  This finding was considered surprising since preclinical \nstudies of the E.coli homologue, MutY, in E.coli and mouse knockout models had not \nsuggested that a defect in this BER protein alone should be strongly linked with \ncarcinogenesis (Moriya and Grollman, 1993; Xie et al., 2004).  The clinical finding of \n 14\nbiallelic mutation has been confirmed by subsequent preclinical and clinical studies \n(Nielsen et al., 2005; Sieber et al., 2004; Tenesa et al., 2006), resulting in the description \nof a new disease, MYH-associated polyposis (MAP).  MAP is an autosomal recessive \ndisease characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas and biallelic mutation of MYH.  It \nis of particular interest to pediatricians and physicians who see colorectal cancer in young \npatients who do not meet the criteria for the APC-inherited disease, familial adenomatous \npolyposis (FAP), or the mismatch repair disease, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal \ncancer (HNPCC).  More recently, a study of 928 colorectal cancer cases and 845 healthy \ncontrols from Scotland, supported by a meta- analysis from published data on the \nassociation between mutations at MYH and colorectal cancer risk, has suggested that a \nsmall but significant mono- allelic effect may also exist (Farrington et al., 2005).  Recent \ndata suggest phenotypic similarities between colorectal cancers characterized by \nmismatch repair defects and those characterized by biallelic mutation of MYH (Aaltonen \net al., 2007; Peterlongo et al., 2006). Other studies are emerging which associate \nmutations in hMYH with other human cancers such as gastric cancer (Zhang et al., 2006).    \n \n3.2 DNA Polymerases \nWhereas DNA glycosylases show \u201cfunctional redundancy\u201d due to the existence of \nbackup enzymes with overlapping activities, BER enzymes downstream of the \nglycosylase step play key roles in coordinating BER and are essential in embryonic \ndevelopment.  Absence of APE1 (Xanthoudakis et al., 1996), Pol \u03b2 (Gu et al., 1994), \nXRCC1 (Tebbs et al., 1999) and DNA ligase III (Puebla-Osorio et al., 2006) is \nembryonic lethal.  In the case of APE1, for example, under-expression leads to apoptosis \nof cells essential to neurological development (Izumi et al., 2005). \n  Of the BER enzymes downstream of the glycosylase step, Pol \u03b2 has been the \nmost extensively studied in relation to carcinogenesis.  Pol \u03b2 null mice display a tissue-\nspecific reduction of 1-nt frameshift mutations as well as increased apoptosis compared \nto wild type embryos (Sweasy et al., 2005).  Studies have shown that under-expression of \nPol \u03b2 increases the rate of chromosomal aberrations by reducing BER activity (Dalal et \nal., 2005; Matsuzaki et al., 1996).  The accumulation of such DNA damages ultimately \nresults in genomic mutagenesis or apoptosis.  Using expression arrays as a screening tool, \n 15\nAlbertella and colleagues observed reduced levels of Pol \u03b2 mRNA and protein in \napproximately one fifth of all tumours sampled, particularly breast and colon cancers \n(Albertella et al., 2005b).  Furthermore, they found that Pol \u03b2 under-expression correlates \nwith under-expression of other DNA polymerases, providing potential links with other \ncellular pathways.   \n Pol \u03b2 over-expression appears to be more common in cancer than under-\nexpression.  Early observations indicated that Pol \u03b2 is overexpressed in some cancer cells \ngrown in vitro (Bergoglio et al., 2001; Canitrot et al., 1999; Srivastava et al., 1999; Tan et \nal., 2005).  Indeed, overexpression of Pol \u03b2 by 2 to 4-fold in mammalian cells can \nincrease mutation rate (Canitrot et al., 1998) and promote genomic instability.  Albertella \nand colleagues used expression arrays to systematically study the expression patterns of \nDNA polymerases (Pol \u03b2, \u03bb, \u03b4, \u03b5) in samples of cancer tissue compared to normal tissue \n(Albertella et al., 2005b).  They found that Pol \u03b2 was overexpressed at the mRNA level \nand the protein level in approximately one third of tumours sampled, particularly samples \nof cancer taken form the uterus, ovary, prostate and stomach.  Pol \u03bb was also \noverexpressed in a range of tumours, but to a lesser extent than Pol \u03b2.  The long-patch \nBER DNA polymerases, Pol \u03b4 and \u03b5, were not commonly overexpressed in this study \n(Albertella et al., 2005b). \n Studies comparing mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) cells that are wild-type or \nnull for Pol \u03b2 have yielded interesting results regarding the potential role of Pol \u03b2 in the \nresponse to ionizing radiation or chemotherapy with alkylating agents.  The Pol \u03b2-\ndeficient MEFs exhibited hypersensitivity to DNA alkylating agents (Poltoratsky et al., \n2005).  Surprisingly, this hypersensitivity was lost when only the N-terminal dRp lyase \ndomain of Pol \u03b2 was provided, suggesting greater functional redundancy for BER \npolymerase activities than for dRp excision activities. \n \n3.3 PARP-1 \nAs discussed above, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is one of the most \nabundant proteins in the nucleus of normal cells.  In response to DNA damage, PARP1 \nundergoes self-ADP-ribosylation and is known to interact with XRCC1, DNA ligase III \nand Pol \u03b2.  PARP-1 cooperatively interacts with PARP2 in DNA repair processes. \n 16\nConsequently, double deficient models have been studied to elucidate the role of PARP1 \nin DNA repair and carcinogenesis.  This approach revealed that PARP-1 null mice are \nhypersensitive to alkylating agents and ionizing radiation (Menissier-de Murcia et al., \n1997; Wang et al., 1997). Several research teams have studied radiation-induced DNA \nalterations and carcinogenesis in PARP-1-deficient mice. Unfortunately, results have not \nbeen consistent across studies and definite conclusions cannot be drawn.  For example, \nPARP1-deficient mice with a p53-knockout background or treated with oral carcinogens \nyielded diverse results ranging from an enhancement of the frequency of induced tumours \nto a reduction in carcinogenesis (Beneke and Moroy, 2001; Conde et al., 2001).   \nStudies with PARP inhibitors have yielded further discrepant results.  Such \ndiscrepancy between knockout models and pharmacological inhibition may not be \nsurprising since studies using PARP-1-deficient experimental systems do not distinguish \nbetween findings that are related to the physical absence of the enzyme (its \u2018scaffold\u2019 \nfunction) and those owing to the lack of catalytic activity (its \u2018enzymatic\u2019 function).   \nGenerally speaking, although its specific functions are not known, PARP-1 seems to have \nmore important roles in DNA repair under stress conditions (such as radiation, \ncarcinogen exposure or exposure to certain antitumour drugs) than in normal (non-\nstressed) cells (Eberhart, 2003).  PARP-1 does not appear to have an active role in \napoptosis (Jagtap and Szabo, 2005). \nSince PARP-1 can be activated up to 100-fold by DNA strand breaks, changes in \nthe expression or abundance of PARP-1 are not considered of primary regulatory \nrelevance.  Nevertheless, several recent reports have shown up- or down-regulation of \nPARP1 in pathophysiological conditions, including its up-regulation in chronic heart \nfailure and in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis and colitis (Hong et al., 2004; \nSzabo and Dawson, 1998).  Similarly, up-regulation of PARP-1 expression\/activity has \nbeen observed in several cancers.  Elevated PARP-1 activity has been shown in cell lines, \nincluding those derived from small cell lung cancer and androgen-sensitive prostate \ncancer (reviewed in (Jagtap and Szabo, 2005)).  It has also been demonstrated in tissue \nsamples obtained from patients with colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma and \nhepatocellular carcinoma (Iizuka et al., 2006; Nosho et al., 2006; Staibano et al., 2005).  \n 17\nPARP-1 mRNA levels have been found to be increased in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma \nsamples, compared to normal or reactive lymph node samples (Menegazzi et al., 1999).   \n \n4. Targeting BER to improve cancer therapy \nMost commonly used cancer therapies, particularly ionizing radiation and certain classes \nof cytotoxic chemotherapies, cause cell death by damaging DNA.  The therapeutic index \nrefers to the amount of tumor cell kill relative to normal tissue damage.  Molecularly \ntargeted agents have been developed over the past decade to try to improve the \ntherapeutic index in the treatment of cancer.  The development of resistance to cytotoxic \ntherapy is a major clinical problem.  It is extremely common in the clinic to observe the \ndevelopment of resistance to chemotherapy that was initially effective.  In this section of \nthe review, the potential for targeting BER will be discussed with a view to improving the \ntherapeutic index of existing cancer therapies and reducing the development of resistance \nto therapy. \n \n4.1 Targeting APE1 \nSeveral preclinical studies using antisense and RNA interference have shown that \ndownregulation of BER enzymes sensitizes cells to various anticancer agents. In \nparticular, down-regulation of APE1 sensitizes cells to alkylating agents and ionizing \nradiation (Tell et al., 2005). \nMethoxyamine is a small molecule which binds to apurinic (AP) sites by reacting \nwith aldehyde group of deoxyribose residue, thus preventing their processing by APE1.  \nIn the case of patients treated with cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as temozolomide \n(TMZ) or 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), AP sites are formed following \nthe removal of the drug-induced methylated purines by the DNA glycosylase.  Blocking \nthe processing of such AP sites with agents such as methoxyamine leads to an \naccumulation of these potentially cytotoxic sites in DNA (Liu and Gerson, 2004).  \nMethoxyamine has been shown to augment the cytotoxicity of a range of DNA damaging \nagents in cells grown in vitro and in xenograft studies (Liu et al., 2002; Taverna et al., \n2003). Methoxyamine appears to potentiate cytotoxicity in both MMR-proficient and -\ndeficient cells (Taverna et al., 2001).  It also appears to bypass other potential resistance \n 18\nfactors such as the loss of p53 tumour suppressor function (Liu and Gerson, 2004).  An \nexample of these concepts is provided by a recent project in which the enhancement of \nTMZ cytotoxicity was studied by the addition of methoxyamine to three ovarian cancer \ncell lines, SKOV-3x, Ovcar-3, and IGROV-1, grown in vitro (Fishel et al., 2007).  These \nexperiments demonstrated the effective modulation of the cytotoxic activity of TMZ via \nmethoxyamine.  Transfection studies revealed that this effect was not dependent on p53 \nstatus but that it was influenced by N-methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG) \noverexpression (Fishel et al., 2007).  Such findings lend support to the hypothesis that \nBER modulators may have a role in augmenting clinical responses to cytotoxic agents \ncurrently used in the clinic (see below).  A Phase I clinical trial of methoxyamine in \ncombination with TMZ is currently in progress in the USA. \nWith regard to sensitization of cells to radiotherapy, the halogenated thymidine \nanalogue, 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, has been shown to radiosensitize cancer cells in \npreclinical studies.  Moreover, combining methoxyamine and 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine has \nbeen shown to potentiate this radiosensitization (Taverna et al., 2003).   \nA related strategy for targeting AP sites is to interfere with the function of the \nrepair enzyme APE1 which processes the AP site. One reason why such targeting of the \nenzyme might be a more promising strategy than the use of methoxyamine or its \nderivatives is that APE1 is a multifunctional enzyme which has additional roles in BER \nand DNA strand break repair unrelated to AP site processing. For example, APE1 \nis the major 3'-phosphoglycolate diesterase in human cells; this activity may be important \nin protecting cells against the potentially carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation \n(Parsons et al., 2004).  APE1 also regulates the DNA binding activity of several key \ntranscription factors involved in redox signaling (Tell et al., 2005).  Several research \ngroups have generated small molecule inhibitors of APE1. One such APE1 inhibitor, \nCRT0044876, inhibits the AP endonuclease, 3'-phosphodiesterase and 3'-phosphatase \nactivities of APE1 at low micromolar concentrations (Madhusudan et al., 2005). At non-\ncytotoxic concentrations, CRT0044876 enhances the cytotoxicity of several DNA base-\ntargeting compounds, including the DNA alkylating and methylating agent, TMZ.  An \nalternative agent, lucanthone, inhibits the repair activity of the exonuclease III family \nmembers (APE1 and ExoIII), but not endonuclease IV AP endonucleases, nor \n 19\nbifunctional glycosylase\/lyases such as endonuclease VIII or formamidopyrimidine-DNA \nglycosylase (Fpg). The addition of lucanthone inhibits APE1 repair activity from cellular \nextracts and enhances the cell killing effect of the alkylating agents, methyl \nmethanesulfonate (MMS) and TMZ (Luo and Kelley, 2004).  \n \n5.2  PARP-1 inhibitors \nAs discussed in section 2.3 above, PARP plays a role in BER that is not fully understood.  \nDespite this incomplete knowledge base, PARP inhibitors have been used to suppress \nDNA repair and to promote apoptosis in cancer cells and PARP-1 inhibitors are in \nclinical trials in combination with certain anticancer agents (Table 2).  \nThe combination with TMZ is the best contemporary example of this clinical \ndevelopment. Resistance to TMZ therapy frequently develops during the treatment of \ncancers such as glioblastoma multiforme and malignant melanoma and, on account of the \nlack of alternative effective therapies, such resistance represents a major clinical problem.  \nThe efficient repair of methyl adducts at the O6 position of guanine is mediated by O6-\nalkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) or the mismatch-repair system. The \ncombination of PARP-1 inhibitors with TMZ interferes with the repair of methylpurines. \nThese agents do not usually contribute to the cytotoxicity that is induced by TMZ.  When \nPARP-1 is inhibited, it remains bound to SSB and it hampers strand rejoining, which in \nturn leads to the generation of permanent single strand breaks that trigger the apoptotic \nprocess. Studies performed in vitro and in vivo have shown that combining PARP \ninhibitors with TMZ enhances the cytotoxic effects of TMZ (Liu et al., 1999; Tentori et \nal., 2003; Tentori et al., 2006).  Indeed, such a combinatorial approach restores the \nsensitivity of mismatch repair-deficient tumours to TMZ (Liu et al., 1999).   \nPARP-1 inhibitors have also been shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of the \ncamptothecin DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors, irinotecan and topotecan.  These agents \nare currently used in the clinic to treat colorectal cancer, other gastrointestinal cancers, \nlung cancer and ovarian cancer.  PARP-1 interacts with, and promotes the activity of, \ntopoisomerase I. Poly (ADP-ribosyl)ated PARP1 and PARP2 counteract the action of the \ncamptothecin compounds by facilitating the resealing of DNA-strand breaks (Park and \nCheng, 2005).  The combination of the anthracycline, doxorubicin, and the PARP-1 \n 20\ninhibitors appears particularly effective in p53-deficient breast cancer lines (Munoz-\nGamez et al., 2005).  In this context, PARP inhibition might be of clinical value, as it \nmay also prevent the cardiotoxic side effects of doxorubicin which currently limit its \ncumulative dosing in patients.  More recently, collaboration between PARP1 and DNA \ntopoisomerase II-associated proteins has also been discovered (Lis and Kraus, 2006). \nAnother recently recognized use of PARP-1 inhibitors could be in the context of \nenhancing cancer-cell killing in cells deficient in homologous recombination. Two \ncomplementary studies demonstrate that cells that are deficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are \nacutely sensitive to killing by PARP-1 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo (Bryant et al., 2005; \nFarmer et al., 2005).  Although the majority of sporadic breast cancer is not deficient in \neither of these genes, these findings offer significant hope for specific treatment in \npatients whose tumours are shown to be deficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2, particularly \npatients with inherited breast cancer.  A clinical trial is due to open to recruitment in the \nUK to accumulate early clinical data in such patient groups treated with a PARP-1 \ninhibitor developed by KuDOS Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, UK).  \nA further potential application of PARP inhibitors in cancer treatment might be \nrelated to the enhancement of the cytotoxic effects of radiotherapy. Various classes of \nPARP-1 inhibitors have been shown to exert radiosensitizing effects in vitro (Brock et al., \n2004; Noel et al., 2006; Veuger et al., 2003). The in vivo efficacy of PARP inhibition for \nradiosensitization has been demonstrated in a preclinical study, which found that the \nintraperitoneal administration of the PARP-1 inhibitor AG14361 enhanced the sensitivity \nof colon carcinoma subcutaneous xenografts to radiation therapy (Calabrese et al., 2004). \nSeveral small molecule PARP-1 inhibitors have been synthesized, listed in Table \n3. Most of the PARP targeting inhibitors have structural similarity to the natural \nsubstrate, oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and therefore act as \ncompetitive inhibitors.  The effects in preclinical models appear similar for most of the \nagents studied.  For example, in preclinical models, NU1025 enhances the cytotoxicity of \nionizing radiation, TMZ and topoisomerase inhibitors (Bowman et al., 2001; Delaney et \nal., 2000). Similar effects have been demonstrated with NU1064, NU1085 and AG14361 \n(Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA), GPI15427 (Guilford Pharmaceutical \n 21\nInc., Baltimore, MD, USA) and CEP-6800 (Cephalon, Inc., West Chester, PA, USA) \n(Madhusudan and Middleton, 2005).  \nOne general concern relating to systemic treatment with PARP-1 inhibitors is the \nimpairment of DNA repair in normal cells, which might render them more susceptible \nto the toxic effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  Such an effect would not improve \nthe therapeutic index and would not represent a significant advance in improving existing \ntreatments.  Although TMZ works primarily against actively proliferating cells, the \ncombination of TMZ and PARP-1 inhibitors can be toxic to resting cells (Tentori et al., \n2001).  Although no significant toxicities have been reported so far, clinical trials must be \nconducted to carefully monitor early effects on normal tissues, particularly gut epithelium \nand bone marrow.  It should also be noted that, analagous to the effects of radiation on \ncertain normal tissues, covert toxicity to differentiated resting cells may not become \napparent until months or years have passed since treatment with PARP-1 inhibitors.  \n \n5.3  Resistance to platinum agents \nCisplatin and carboplatin are amongst the chemotherapeutic agents most commonly used \nto treat solid cancers in humans, particularly in chemo-radiation strategies in which \nchemotherapy and radiation therapy are administered concomitantly.  Platinum \nresistance, either intrinsic or acquired during cyclical treatment with the agent, is a major \nclinical problem since additional agents that can be added to therapy in order to \ncircumvent tumour resistance do not currently exist.  Biochemical studies have \ndemonstrated that cells can become resistant to cisplatin by various cellular mechanisms, \nsuch as a reduction in the uptake of the drug, increased detoxification via interaction of \nthe drug with intracellular thiols, and alterations in the ability of the cell to recognise and \nprocess cisplatin\u2013DNA adducts.  One current paradigm postulates that the DNA adducts \nproduced by the platinum drugs are recognised by a detector, the detector activates a \nseries of damage-responsive signal transduction pathways, and this in turn triggers \napoptosis (Chaney et al., 2005). Failure of any one component of this sequential process \nmay result in drug resistance.   \n 22\nOxaliplatin is a third generation platinum compound that differs from cisplatin \nand carboplatin in that it has a broader spectrum of antitumour activity.  Like cisplatin, it \nis employed as a radiosensitiser in chemo-radiation therapeutic strategies (Sharma et al., \n2007). Although cisplatin and oxaliplatin form the same types of adducts at the same sites \non the DNA (approximately 60\u201365% intrastrand GG, 25\u201330% intrastrand AG, 5\u201310% \nintrastrand GNG, and 1\u20133% interstrand GG diadducts), biochemical studies have \nsuggested that oxaliplatin adducts are recognised and processed differently from those \nproduced by the earlier generation platinum-containing drugs (Chaney et al., 2005; \nEastman, 1987).  Whereas nucleotide excision repair and recombination repair do not \ndiscriminate between the repair of cisplatin and oxaliplatin adduct, the following repair \nprocesses appear to discriminate between cisplatin-DNA adducts and oxaliplatin-DNA \nadducts:  specific damage-recognition proteins and the translesion DNA polymerases \n(Chaney et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2004). \nIn particular, there is accumulating evidence for the concept that tumour \nresistance may be mediated by enhanced tolerance to adducts in DNA.   Translesion \nDNA synthesis is a pathway of post-replication repair that allows replication of Pt\u2013\ndamaged DNA without removal of the adduct.  Several mammalian DNA polymerases \nare capable of bypassing adducts engendered by oxaliplatin, which would normally arrest \ncellular replication if bypass does not occur (Havener et al., 2003; Vaisman and Chaney, \n2000).  Upregulation of levels of or enhanced activity of such enzymes would be \nexpected to permit survival of cancer cells under conditions of \u201cadduct load\u201d that would \nnormally be lethal.    \nA series of studies have demonstrated that human DNA polymerases \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b7 \ncan bypass oxaliplatin (as well as cisplatin) adducts in human DNA.  Both p53 and DNA \nmismatch repair proteins appear to play a role in modulating the extent to which bypass \nreplication occurs (Avkin et al., 2006).  The efficiency of bypass, measured by the primer \nextension assay, developed by Chaney and colleagues, is: human pol \u03b7 > human pol \n\u03bc > human pol \u03b2  human pol \u03b3  yeast pol \u03b6 (Havener et al., 2003; Vaisman and \nChaney, 2000).  Whereas Pol \u03bc bypasses Pt\u2013DNA adducts in a mostly error-prone \nmanner and catalyzes a high percentage of frame-shifts in the vicinity of the adduct, the \n 23\nother translesion polymerases predominantly catalyze misinsertions opposite Pt\u2013DNA \nadducts (Havener et al., 2003; Vaisman and Chaney, 2000).  Of the human DNA \npolymerases tested to date, both pol \u03b7 and pol \u03b2 bypass oxaliplatin\u2013GG adducts with \nhigher efficiency than cisplatin\u2013GG adducts (Bassett et al., 2003; Havener et al., 2003).  \nThe efficiency and fidelity of bypass by these translesion polymerases is likely to affect \nthe mutagenicity of the adducts.  The potential mutagenicity of translesion synthesis is of \nnote since it may be an important factor in genomic instability and clonal evolution of \ncancers during treatment with oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy. \nRecent in vitro studies have suggested that targeting DNA polymerases involved \nin translesion synthesis past cisplatin and oxaliplatin adducts may overcome intrinsic or \nacquired tumour resistance to chemotherapy.  Certain investigators have demonstrated a \ngeneral requirement for pol \u03b7 expression in providing tolerance to oxaliplatin, cisplatin \nand carboplatin using xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) cell lines (polymerase \u03b7-\nnull)  grown in vitro and transfection techniques (Albertella et al., 2005a).  In certain cell \ntypes, the absence of pol \u03b7 expression resulted in a reduced ability to overcome cisplatin-\ninduced S phase arrest.  Other researchers have compared normal human fibroblasts \n(NHF1) with XPV cells after treatment with cisplatin, as well as comparing XPV cells \ncomplemented for polymerase 71 expression with the isogenic cells carrying the empty \nexpression vector (Bassett et al., 2004). Cytotoxicity and induced mutagenicity \nexperiments were performed, demonstrating that equitoxic doses of cisplatin induced \nmutations in fibroblasts lacking polymerase \u03b7 at frequencies 2- to 2.5-fold higher than in \nfibroblasts with either normal or high levels of polymerase \u03b7.  Collectively, these findings \nin cells grown in vitro demonstrate the role of polymerase \u03b7 in translesion synthesis and \npotential mutagenicity and therefore identify it as a target for intervention in order to \ninhibit the development of platinum resistance during cancer therapy.  \n \nConclusions \n 24\nAlthough extensive knowledge currently exists regarding the biochemical \nmechanisms involved in human BER, the cellular functions of specific BER pathways \nremains relatively unknown.  For example, the effect of the cell cycle on the availability \nand activity of BER enzymes remains poorly understood.  The ability of cancer cells to \nevolve or adapt subpathways of BER in order to survive potentially mutagenic insults, \nsuch as treatment with platinum agents, requires particular investigation.  The \ndiscrepancy between the studies of E.coli MutY in preclinical models and the findings \nregarding its human homologue hMYH in patients with adenomatous polyposis coli, \nresulting in the description of a new disease entity, emphasizes the need for translational \nresearch, particularly from bedside back to bench, in order to discover the link between \nbiochemical knowledge of BER and human carcinogenesis.  Early clinical trials of agents \ntargeting specific BER enzymes, such as PARP1, APE1 or DNA polymerases, represent \na valuable opportunity to obtain tissues for the analysis of BER mechanisms in human \ntissues, which may ultimately result in the translation of biochemical knowledge into \neffective therapies for cancer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nRAS is supported by Cancer Research UK.

AP endonuclease (APE) then cleaves the \nphosphodiester bond 5' to the AP site containing 3'-OH and 5'-sugar phosphate ends.  \nBoth AP endonuclease induced and direct strand break are recognized by PARP-1 dimer.  \nFollowing NAD+-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1, automodified PARP-1 \nthen dissociates from DNA.
