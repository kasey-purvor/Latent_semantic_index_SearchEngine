It was born as a \u2018tool\u2019 and now finds itself in the\nguise of a somewhat wobbly arrow of change. In practice, changing the way thousands of teachers\nteach, learners learn, innovation is promoted and sustainable change in traditional institutions is\nachieved across hundreds of different disciplines is a demanding endeavour that will not be achieved\nby learning technologies alone. It involves art, craft and science as well as technology. This paper\nattempts to show how it might be possible to capture and model complex strategic processes that\nwill help move the potential of e-learning in universities to a new stage of development. It offers the\nexample of a four-quadrant model created as a framework for an e-learning strategy.\nIntroduction\nLike most people, I am amused by human\u2019s early attempts to fly and especially at the\nfocus on frantically flapping feathered wings, inspired by the observation of birds.\nThe breakthrough to powered flight and subsequently flying for all came when the\ninventors rethought the conceptual approach and developed aircraft based upon fixed\nwings in a steady airflow.\nThe introduction of information and communications technologies (ICT) into the\nworld of learning and teaching in universities is now in transition from \u2018flapping\u2019 to\nmass take off thanks to appropriate conceptual underpinnings. It too has passed\nthrough two stages. At first, learning technologies were seen as a new way of doing\nsomething familiar. This first stage is what might be thought of as the electronic class-\nroom. The physical environment in which teaching and learning occurs is replaced to\n*Professor of E-learning & Learning Technologies, Beyond Distance Research Alliance, University\nof Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK. Email: Gilly.salmon@le.ac.uk\n202 G. Salmon\nsome extent, but the processes of teaching, the essential pedagogical approach and\nthe underlying assumptions about learning and knowledge sharing remain largely\nunchanged. In these circumstances, there is a risk that the widespread adoption of\neasy-to-use learning technologies such as Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs)\nmay be mistaken for educational innovation (Westera, 2004). In the second phase\nhowever, learning technologies are used in new ways, to advance beyond what was\npossible in the classroom or to combine traditional approaches with e-learning in\neffective and worthwhile modes to meet new objectives and purposes of teaching and\nlearning.\nMany projects, authors and managers in higher education institutions (HEIs) saw\ne-learning as offering high potential for business development and quality improve-\nment, and subscribed to the prediction that the teaching paradigm would somehow\nchange. In practice, e-learning is complex and involves considerable individual and\ninstitutional change, beyond the provision of technology (Zentel et al., 2004). In\n2005, we are on the runway to the second stage but more lift and understanding is\nneeded to progress.\nUnlike the early aviators who had their focus firmly on powered lift off, in univer-\nsities those purposes, missions, new markets and intentions are far from obvious and\ninteract in a very complex way with the available learning technologies. To under-\nstand and undertake the rethinking and associated organizational changes, the natu-\nral intrinsic conservatism in universities must be surfaced, explored and addressed\n(Westera, 2004).\nThe introduction of learning technologies\nIn 2005, almost every HEI is planning to use one or more VLEs, for one reason or\nanother (Dickson, 2004; Garrett & Jokivirta, 2004), and almost every HEI in the\nUnited Kingdom is attempting to do so whether for distance or blended learning\n(Calvert, 2005). But, with a few exceptions, VLEs are \u2018flapped\u2019 learning\u2014an attempt\nat a transference of existing pedagogy. In other words, most HEIs have adopted a\n\u2018substitutional\u2019 approach, while also believing that there would somehow be a natural\npathway to more radical pedagogical change.\nAs teaching on campuses is mainly an individual and traditional craft, it is unsur-\nprising that most academics and their supporters cannot see beyond the flapping of\ntheir wings at this stage and so continue to preserve their existing and familiar peda-\ngogical approaches, defined along disciplinary lines, regardless of the introduction of\nnew technology (Anderson et al., 2005). Those academics who have fully engaged\nwith e-learning either explored learning technologies for their novelty or have been\ndriven by a na\u00efve belief in their economic benefits. When some evaluation and\nresearch started there was much \u2018talking up\u2019 by those who were caught up in the\npotential along with overcritical dismissal by those lagging behind, often with good\nreason (Sullivan & Czigler, 2002). To date, the differences and similarities between\nonline, traditional distance and physical-based teaching have been little understood,\nleading to confused notions of the panacea of \u2018blend\u2019.\nStrategic framework for e-learning and pedagogical innovation 203\nAs learning technologies become increasing deployed in higher education, the\nhardware and connectivity reduces in price. Fast, reliable networks, some highly\nmobile, are commonplace. Overselling and exaggerated claims from commercial\nproviders, and perhaps overzealous responses from the open source promoters, have\nled academics to focus on the explicit attributes of a learning technology rather than\nthe inherent pedagogical assumptions, their intrinsic potential and their value for the\ndevelopment and achievement of new ideas, missions, markets and improvements in\nquality. In 2005, as the hype from around the turn of the Century has died away, only\nVLEs (principally Blackboard and WebCT in the United Kingdom) and lecture-\nsupport systems (especially PowerPoint) have been widely employed (Zemsky &\nMassy, 2004). There is a lack of institutional learning from the many thousands of\nisolated experiments and innovations as, in many universities, internal investment,\nreward, recognition and approval systems do not encourage systematic change or\nexperimentation (Calvert, 2005).\nThere continues to be many unanticipated consequences related to the previous\nna\u00efve \u2018pushing\u2019 of learning technologies (Goodyear, 2005). Typically there is banal\nand obvious usage of a learning technology. For example, it is a common belief\namong managers, policy-makers and strategists that, by encouraging academics to\npost some notices or PowerPoint slides on a VLE, an e-learning process emerges that\nwill benefit learning, and that in some magical way such academics will \u2018cross the\ndivide\u2019 and understand motivating online learning systems or even remote knowledge\nconstruction. Or as a response to participants\u2019 logging on to bulletin boards errati-\ncally, strict controls are imposed on postings on asynchronous networks, resulting in\ndiminution of their key attribute of flexibility and choice in e-learning. The result is\nexpensive mistakes, loss of quality and much frustration.\nLearning technologies are not transparent, their properties are not obvious and\nthey do not broadcast their utility. No VLE will ever be enough in itself to create great\ne-learning. However, teachers and designers frequently attribute the capacity for\ndoing or achieving the learning to the technology. It just cannot be successful without\nappropriate, well-supported and focused human intervention, good learning design\nor pedagogical input and the sensitive handling of the process over time by trained\nonline tutors. In addition the complexity is further increased by the impact of ICT\noccurring at differing intervention points in the HEI\u2014from the \u2018micro\u2019 level such as\nanimations in teaching content, to the \u2018meso\u2019 level, such as changes to library facilities\nor provision of media centres, to the \u2018macro\u2019 policy and large-scale collaborations\n(Zentel et al., 2004).\nModes of learning\nOutside the single-mode distance universities, there is considerable evidence that by\n2005 the dominant mode to which HEIs aspire is what Zentel et al. (2004) cutely call\n\u2018Alma mater multimedialis\u2019. By this they refer to the way campus-based universities\nare gradually integrating online components into their more traditional face-to-face\napproaches as \u2018add-ons\u2019 or in a blended mode. Zentel et al. suggest the popularity of\n204 G. Salmon\nmulti-mode results from the need to address the desire of younger undergraduates to\nattend a campus while also increasing flexibility and value through multimedia and\nonline provision. Distance education is similarly challenged in the twenty-first century,\nboth as a field of practice and of study (Calvert, 2005). Even for distance education,\nwhere technology has been integrated from the beginning of its development, Moore\n(2003) notes that \u2018the organisation, philosophies and issues are not technologically\nspecific\u2019. From all the literature on the topic of modes, there are two dominant\nfeatures. First, any approach to \u2018one technology and pedagogy fits all\u2019 is pretty much\ndoomed to flap and then crash, with little transferability of the reasons associated with\nthe failures to benefit new attempts. Second, there is challenge to the quality and utility\nof the research to inform both policy and practice, leading to poor results associated\nwith the embedding of innovation in HEIs (Calvert, 2005; Latchem, 2005).\nInstitutional change\nThere are well-rehearsed intentions and plans to achieve economic and quality bene-\nfits from the introduction of e-learning\u2014and many HEIs have been seduced by this\npotential, in part because of their competitive and demanding market places (Collis\n& van der Wende, 2002). Part two of the e-University Compendium offers a wide\nrange of international examples from recent years (Higher Education Academy,\n2005). However, these reports illustrate that many HEIs have a somewhat shaky\napproach to future e-learning markets and an aspirational rather than realistic\napproach to the achievement of student numbers together with the lack of capacity to\nadapt, especially from the perspective of academic staff and institutional structures.\nInnovations in the democratic and conservative decision-making structures of univer-\nsities have always had somewhat of a hard time. E-learning creates further pointed\ntensions in these political processes due to the pace of change, the investments\nrequired, and the need for involvement of more staff and stakeholders (Whitworth,\n2005). Consequently, many approaches that deployed e-learning have failed or\nwasted large amounts of money in the recent past because universities were taken by\nsurprise about the low conversion rate of potential markets into actual registrations,\nthe difficulty in reaching a global market through advertising or agents, the require-\nments of higher levels of resources and the slow time to market, and hence were\nunable to change internally sufficiently fast and well.\nThe costs of e-learning attract much more attention and challenge than the invest-\nment in more conventional learning infrastructure. On-campus costs are often in\nlegacy systems and buildings. E-learning costs have been the subject of studies in the\nUnited Kingdom (for example, Rumble, 2001, 2004; Ash & Bacsich, 2002). E-learn-\ning, like distance learning, requires more up-front investment (compared with\ncampus-based teaching) but offers a low cost and sustainable model over several years\nif large numbers of students continue to register. Attempting scaling up of e-learning\nthrough \u2018hand crafting\u2019 (possible in campus-based learning) cannot be supported\nover time. Therefore predictions need to be made of which courses are worth funding\nin this way, serious choices made and resources diverted in those directions.\nStrategic framework for e-learning and pedagogical innovation 205\nAny pedagogical innovation has start-up costs, especially if associated with the\nsharing and reusability of resources and processes. Costs associated with e-learning\ninclude the capital and direct costs of the technology itself but also the development\nof resources involving a number of professionals and considerable academic and\ntechnical staff development, to increase the chances of success. In the medium term,\nthe costs associated with the human resources are likely to be higher, but offer more\nreliable payback and quality than the technology provision (Zemsky & Massy,\n2004).\nWhile e-learning in higher education is now considered (indeed, sometimes\nwelcomed by many staff) for its potential, real development beyond projects initiated\nby innovators has so far been modest. Most HEIs are still struggling to engage a\nsignificant percentage of students and staff in e-learning. All HEIs are vulnerable to\na wide variety of pressures but have a high resistance to change. They are awash with\nrich resources in the form of intelligent keen individuals who are rarely appropriately\ndirected to pedagogical innovation nor are self-motivated to radically transform their\nteaching. Third-generation flying\u2014the helicopter\u2014rarely lands in a central position\non the campus!\nE-learning, whether combined with other forms of teaching and learning or not, is\nmultifaceted and involves shifts both in understanding and behaviours. Most\nacademics responsible for both the curriculum and the pedagogical processes arising\nfrom e-learning have not made these shifts. It is most unlikely that a whole univer-\nsity can be \u2018re-engineered\u2019 (Brown, 2002) to accommodate the major changes asso-\nciated with e-learning. Many academics still view e-learning as impersonal,\nconstraining and insufficiently adaptive to the needs of a wide variety of learners.\nThis view has arisen mainly because of the over-simplistic approaches in the earlier\ndays. To date, much of the focus has been into the development of technologies or\ntop-down policy aspirations, and not on the human dimensions, scaling-up and\nembedding of innovation and the associated management of change (Tham &\nWerner, 2005).\nPedagogy\nAcademic staff are naturally reluctant to change their methods of teaching and learn-\ning (and move from stage one\u2014flapping\u2014to stage two\u2014flying) without a deep\nunderstanding of why and how and what the impact will be in terms of quality and\nany resultant benefits. Furthermore, most staff who are inexperienced in e-learning\ninitially believe that it is about technical \u2018solutions\u2019 rather than pedagogical innova-\ntion. Given the research imperative in most institutions, there are few direct benefits\nfor academics to innovate in their teaching, and as such staff development and\nsupport are essential to promote and encourage uptake. To engage large numbers of\nacademics, any approach must seek to ensure that ownership, not only of content but\nalso of pedagogy, continues to lie directly within academic departments, but also\nrecognizes that a wide variety of supportive mechanisms must underpin the continued\ndevelopments.\n206 G. Salmon\nSome writers have claimed that there has been a recent shift away from traditional\nviews of teaching and learning towards constructivist views of knowledge sharing (for\nexample, Dickey, 2003), because many learning technologies would seem to offer\nnew and wider opportunities (Jones, 2004). This has almost become an accepted\nmantra and, although interesting in raising awareness of differing models and philos-\nophies of learning, has largely added to the naivety surrounding deep use of learning\ntechnologies in practice. For example, the values embedded in many commonly used\nVLEs leave a residue that is clearly transmissive rather than constructed and hence\nadds to the banality and confusion, even disappointment, in the learning and teaching\nexperiences (Sullivan & Czigler, 2002; De Freitas & Oliver, 2005).\nIndividuals and small groups, such as departments in universities, have their own\ndesires, abilities, histories and preferred artefacts; in other words, they are closely\nsituated. Universities themselves consist of cultural, historical, institutional and\npower-constructed contexts (Becher & Trowler, 2001; Whitworth, 2005). At\npresent, few higher education teachers choose to imagine a world in which class-\nrooms are abandoned, since so much of their appreciation of learning has grown\nup in them. In single-mode distance institutions like the UK Open University,\nthere are strong traditions based on openness, procedures and the student experi-\nence. Such institutions have their own challenges of embedding pedagogical and\ntechnological innovation, of a somewhat different nature. Throw a learning tech-\nnology into these heady mixes, introduce a little naively, and it is sidelined, without\na thought, or worse becomes the focus of anger and bitterness.\nMore positively, and probably as a counter response to the over-emphasis on tech-\nnologies that has occurred to date, the term pedagogy has once more surfaced. The\nearly focus on technological infrastructure has given way a little to increased aware-\nness and dialogue on pedagogy, connectedness and in blending newer and older\napproaches to learning. The design of learning activities and the links between online\nand common tasks in teaching have become much more important (Salmon, 2002;\nMcAlpine et al., 2004). More higher education teachers talk of learning outcomes and\nassessable processes. The plane taxis to the runway.\nThe contribution of research\nWith the current focus on the research assessment exercise, a number of writers\nrecently explored the key issue of research into ICT as a disciplined field of inquiry\nas opposed to one of opinion and belief, however eloquent or with surface plausibility\n(see for example, Gardner & Galanouli, 2004). This can be welcomed as a first step\ntowards the second stage of powered flying for e-learning. Research has the potential\nto inform decision-making and policy-making at the macro national levels, but\ndialogue between policy-makers, researchers and practitioners is only now starting to\nhave an impact. Within institutions, at the meso and the micro levels, research needs\nto raise its credibility as well as its dissemination.\nResearch into open and distance learning over more than 30 years has identified\nwhat works, what does not, what constitutes excellence and what adds real value to\nStrategic framework for e-learning and pedagogical innovation 207\nstudent experiences. Much is relevant to e-learning and blended modes. In particular,\nthere is growing recognition of the need for evidence-based research especially\nassociated with achieving positive and successful change processes and in associated\nstaff development (see, for example, the Department for Education and Skills e-\nlearning strategy of 2005) (DfES, 2005). However, such knowledge is of no value if\nit cannot be used in a flexible and contextualized manner, and in particular be embed-\nded into the everyday teaching processes of a university.\nMost academics are motivated, directed even, to undertake research into the burn-\ning questions of their own discipline, even if teaching is something they also enjoy.\nThose that attempt research into their teaching find that generalizing and model-\nbuilding is all but impossible from highly individual studies with multiple variables.\nIt is realistic to recognize that implementing e-learning is a hugely complex undertak-\ning with multiple contexts and stakeholders\u2014and risks (Pittard, 2004). One area\nwhere this critique is especially true is in the drive towards the implementation of\neffective strategy at an institutional level (Lisewski, 2004). The taste for looking\nbeyond the next year in terms of e-learning, and hence being able to develop staff and\nresources for medium-term futures, has been tainted by just such a lack of evidence,\nand, even worse, some expensive crashes. Some of the failures have a high profile\u2014\nsuch as the UK e-University demise\u2014but most happen quietly and painfully within\nindividual institutions (Latchem, 2005). Some writers argue that integrating and scal-\ning-up of ICTs into everyday teaching and learning processes may even be inherently\nparadoxical, because of the nature of the internet as individualistic and exploratory\u2014\ndisruptive even (Somekh, 2004).\nI undertook a content analysis of the Online Educa Conference Proceedings for\n2003 (www.online-educa.com\/en\/) as a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of the research focus (Salmon,\n2004a). There was considerable evidence that e-learning had become much more\nconcerned in the twenty-first century with macro analysis, value for money, incorpo-\nration and integration of multimedia, as well as blended learning and adherence to\nstandards and benchmarking. Although there was strong interest in networking and\ncollaboration between institutions and many exchanges of experiences, there was\nlittle evidence of emergence of harvesting, transferring and testing the sturdiest\nmodels and principles. Essentially, while e-learning is no longer a novelty, it is now\nfacing the same problems that conventional HEIs have faced for many years\u2014quality\nassurance, assessment and the exchange of best practice. Because of its innovatory\napproach, missionary zeal and army of challengers and sceptics, e-learning healthily\nfaced these issues head on, early on in its history.\nBroad areas now to be addressed should include the development of concepts,\ntheories, principles, rigorous and appropriate methodologies, identification, promo-\ntion and support of excellent sustainable, transferable practice and models of\nchange related to human intervention and sustainability. In addition, focusing on\ne-learning is a key way of providing for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary\nresearch agendas through virtual research environments. My own interest is to try\nand establish some basic models of practice to provide frameworks for further\ncontextualized work.\n208 G. Salmon\nIntroducing e-learning successfully\nMy argument in this paper is that, despite the fact that e-learning (and its role as a\nchange agent) figures highly, and sometimes even wistfully, in the aspirations of many\npolicy-makers and senior managers, there is considerable evidence that most HEIs\nare still struggling to engage a significant percentage of students and staff in e-learn-\ning, and real development beyond projects by innovators has so far been modest.\nResearch is currently not providing answers to this problem and more models are\nneeded to demonstrate the transferability and scalability of e-learning.\nThe technology is now just about robust enough for attention to turn to business\ndevelopment and pedagogical innovation and away from technical \u2018solutions\u2019 and\n\u2018fixes\u2019. There are two main ways in which e-learning can be introduced into tradi-\ntional teaching, whether on campus or at a distance. One is through large-scale\ncentralization and provision of professional services. The second is more incremental,\nperhaps a little slower and more challenging, but gradually involving all members of\nstaff to make their contribution. This involves the choice of easy-to-use technologies\nand investment in personal and departmental learning and development. The latter\nhas the advantages of developing capacities for the longer term and keeping \u2018owner-\nship\u2019 with the academics and their departments.\nStrategic underpinnings to an e-learning strategy\nWe can distinguish between a moderate change strategy and a more radical approach\n(Johnston et al., 2001). An incremental approach involves cautiously enhancing\nexisting practice through introducing well-rehearsed and easy-to-use learning tech-\nnologies. At the same time, a research agenda that brings forward weaker signals\nfrom the learning technology\u2019s environment, and indeed society\u2019s, suggests a more\nchallenging approach to changes in the use of learning technologies and the associ-\nated pedagogy. This more radical approach ultimately impacts on organizational\nstructures\u2014a more risky but transformational approach. We need to find a way that\nthe two approaches are not mutually exclusive, and can be turned into practical\nactions within an HEI.\nOne dimension of a strategic framework is to distinguish between core technologies\nand peripheral learning technologies (Salaman & Asch, 2003). The core forms the basis\nof current activities that must be maintained and, since effort and investment have\nbeen put into them, they do not present a high risk. We could consider the use of\ncommercial VLEs and the e-resources provided by a university library to be core tech-\nnologies in 2005. As previously explained, nearly all universities are currently adapting\nto using VLEs, so in the medium term these core capabilities will no longer be inno-\nvative. Peripheral technology is on the \u2018edge\u2019 and offers more choice. A range of poten-\ntial new learning technologies need therefore to be included in the strategy. These can\nbe different from the VLE or incorporated into or extending it. Some peripheral tech-\nnologies do become mainstream over time so the strategy needs ways of including\npotential new technologies and preparing for new capabilities. Hence, it is also\nStrategic framework for e-learning and pedagogical innovation 209\nimportant to focus on building increased capacity and capability for e-learning inno-\nvation and on continually looking ahead to potential and new learning technologies\nand their applications related to a mission or objective. One word of caution regarding\nhow these concepts apply to the introduction of educational technologies in HEIs: the\ncore capabilities that are obvious or are most enjoyed or admired within a university\nmay not be strategically relevant. Instead they need to be those that a wide range of\n\u2018stakeholders\u2019 (students, clients, partners, funding bodies) both perceive and value.\nThe pace of technological change shortens the lifespan of most technology-based\nresources, but, as discussed, all universities demonstrate exceptional slowness to\ntransform. When a particular technology or platform is adopted (e.g. Blackboard) it\nis very difficult to change later. Key capabilities, however, have the potential to be\nmore durable than the technological resources on which they are based.\nInnovative capacity promotes the transfer of knowledge (see Bell & Bell (2005) for\na brief review of relevant models of innovation). For example, some universities are\ngood not only at developing, but also exploiting and transferring their research.\nCollaborations and alliances with others or consortia and joint projects offer ways to\nexplore innovation and peripheral technologies at somewhat lower risk. Each techno-\nlogical development must be placed in its context and culture. Humans, and most\ncertainly academics and teachers, cannot be reduced to mere tool users (Hickman,\n1990). Each individual institution has a need to develop e-learning to match its own\nculture but within an overall context of common development needs with other HEIs\n(Garcia, 2004).\nMy proposal is that a suitable framework for an e-learning strategy in universities\ncould be based on a \u2018resource-based\u2019 definition (Salaman & Asch, 2003) of the match\nthat a university can make between its internal resources and skills, and the opportu-\nnities and risks created by its external environment. Such a framework both implies\nidentifying an individual institution\u2019s core capabilities and existing strengths (what it\nis good at, what makes it special), and how a strategy can take advantage of these in\na competitive world (what it can do well and differently). A strategy based on those\nkinds of strengths would be more durable, and harder to imitate than \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019\nstrategies (Hamel & Valikangas, 2003) or those based on traditional market-led\napproaches (Salaman & Asch, 2003). Thus, choices of where to be innovative and\nwhere to increase the development of e-learning should not be based on a bland view\nof \u2018market\u2019 but on a more complex view of the value of e-learning meeting the univer-\nsity\u2019s mission and objectives as well as playing to its distinguishing institutional\nstrengths (Richards et al., 2004).\nIn 2005, the Higher Education Funding Council for England also recognized\nthat HEIs are most effective if allowed to develop their own directions within a\nsupportive framework. What we need at this stage is to create practical frameworks\nto provide usable models to test and develop in different contexts and over time.\nTwo key government policies set out an agenda for the immediate future, especially\nin terms of the difficulty of truly \u2018embedding\u2019 e-learning into everyday practice\nincluding uncertain leadership, lack of true innovation and lack of professional\nexpertise (Laurillard, 2004; see Appendix 1).\n210 G. Salmon\nProposed framework for e-learning strategies\u2014the example of Leicester\nI will now describe the University of Leicester\u2019s attempt to address these issues.\nLeicester is typical of the traditional campus-based university keen to capitalize on the\nbenefits of e-learning, while also having to move from twentieth-century distance\nlearning to twenty-first-century online learning for its large-scale distance\nprogrammes.\nLate in 2004, I was charged with preparing a strategic framework for the develop-\nment of e-learning at the University of Leicester (www.le.ac.uk). Fortunately the\nuniversity had recognized, prior to my appointment, that e-learning needed to be\ndeveloped with appropriate pedagogical and customer-driven underpinnings. A\nDirector of Distance Learning Administration was appointed at the same time as I\nwas, with an agenda of administrative and systems developments. His strategy and\nactions were developed separately from the e-learning strategy, although each clearly\nunderpins the other.\nIn a \u2018research-led old\u2019 university, dominated by campus learning in traditional\nsubjects, the process of strategy development needed to be one of deep engagement\nof groups of management and staff, academics and support departments. As a start,\nthere was history of postgraduate distance learning, mainly in overseas markets and\nembedded in fairly autonomous separate units in various departments. \u2018Tribal\u2019 and\n\u2018Blackboard\u2019 were the two VLEs already in use in some pockets on campus and for\ndistance study. There were well-established staff development and support process\nfor use of learning technologies.\nThe issue was far from a question of \u2018which VLE?\u2019. I recognized that I was facing\na diverse and complex field concerning a mix of pedagogical changes throughout the\ninstitution and alterations in the way academics and support staff conducted their\nbusiness on a day-to-day basis (Westera, 2004). I needed to develop insight into a\nrange of fundamentals such as resources, control and autonomy and the power of\ncommitment to disciplines and departments. There was allegiance and support from\nsenior management and from a wide variety of staff. There was a need for the strategy\nto harness enthusiasms and focus resources as well as practical knowledge, while\navoiding directive approaches.\nIn researching and developing both a process and a framework for the strategy, I\nwas strongly influenced in my thinking by my previous work on models of e-learning\nand staff development (for example, Salmon, 2004b), as well as 16 years as a change\nmanagement academic at the UK Open University.\nMy approach to engaging others in the university with the e-learning strategy\naddressed a number of key issues, outlined earlier in this paper. I wished to ensure\nthat the model proposed took account of the following: \n1. The role for research into innovative pedagogy, linked directly to learning\ntechnologies.\n2. The development of both core and peripheral learning technologies.\n3. Realistic approaches to marketing and market development both for distance and\nblended learning, especially in terms of student numbers and support.\nStrategic framework for e-learning and pedagogical innovation 211\n4. An embeddedness in the university\u2019s overall aspirations, identified mainly\nthrough its existing formal plans and strategies but interpreted through formal\nand informal discussions.\n5. The need to determine and make explicit the purpose of pedagogical innovation\nand the objectives of the scaling-up of e-learning.\n6. The importance of surfacing existing values in the university in a way that the best\nresources, projects and motivations were preserved.\n7. The strategy needed to sit within wider national frameworks and directions.\nInnovation and change development in universities can never be a mere rational\nprocess (Jones & O\u2019Shea, 2004). Developing e-learning still involves considerable risk\nand opportunity costs, and few institutions have the resources to bet or a thirst for\nchancy ventures, and Leicester was no exception while keen on pedagogical and qual-\nity development. The model developed as the basis of the strategy needed to be easy\nto understand and relate to at a variety of levels, while still offering opportunities to\nthose with a taste for innovation. Given the huge pressure on all staff towards entre-\npreneurial, teaching and research activity, the strategy needed to have an element of\n\u2018enticement\u2019 and comfort about it.\nWhile I was interested in the models of innovation such as Rogers (1993) and\nSomekh (1998), the linear process views appeared too simple to be useful as a frame-\nwork for considering the complexity involved in e-learning in HEIs. Hence a matrix\napproach emerged. Readers may recognize the roots of the framework in the Ansoff\nMatrix (Ansoff, 1965) which was developed, adapted and tested for use here in the\nspecific e-learning strategy and HE context.\nThe e-learning and pedagogical innovation strategic framework\nSummary\n\u25cf Quadrants one, two and three in Figure 1 represent the deployment of a\nuniversity\u2019s existing core capabilities and capacity through incremental innova-\ntion.\n\u25cf Quadrants one and two suggest deployment of a university\u2019s key strengths in teach-\ning excellence but with adjustments to new technologies.\n\u25cf Quadrant three suggests deploying the understanding of technologies already in\nplace to promote business development, solve problems and increase quality of all\nkinds.\n\u25cf Quadrant four represents a more radical view of change using peripheral technol-\nogies, new products and new markets and missions.\nFigure 1. The e-learning and pedagogical innovation strategic framework\nQuadrant One\nThe upper left-hand box of the matrix suggests achieving growth with established core\ntechnological products and processes such as VLEs and e-libraries, embedding them\n212 G. Salmon\nfurther into teaching and learning processes and using them for increasing numbers\nof purposes and students. Here is the gradual evolution from campus and\/or tradi-\ntional paper-based distance learning to pedagogically sound e-learning.\nMuch can be achieved by deploying \u2018off the shelf\u2019 technologies such as commercial\nVLEs but they require careful business planning, investment in staff development and\nsupport, and excellent provision of ICT within university systems. They also require\nastute planning of markets, mission, objectives, student requirements and the\nresources for the support and development of the technology.\nThe university should first identify and target those areas where there is potential\nfor growth, rapid improvement in quality or efficiency gains. The aim can be to move\nmore of its regular learning into the e-environment but in a way such that will enable\nit to pilot transferable or scalable processes. To start with, the focus can be to further\ndevelop communication and group teaching in the online environment, rather than\nfrom print to online resources. At a discipline level, subject centres (www.heacad-\nemy.ac.uk\/474.htm) can provide free academic courseware or learning objects that\ncan be shared, versioned or reused (Mason et al., 2005). Content is usually not\nviewed as a major differentiator by potential students: value lies in brand, support,\ngroup teaching, peers and communication.\nPersonalization and choice based on learning needs is the first step away from the\nlimitations inherent in printed texts, and face-to-face classrooms, and applies well as\na mission for quadrant one. As access to a wide range of resources becomes easier,\nand as the number of resources multiplies, it will become more possible to tailor\nFigure 1. The e-learning and pedagogical innovation strategic framework\nStrategic framework for e-learning and pedagogical innovation 213\naccess to the needs and interests of the individual learner while avoiding loss of econ-\nomies of scale.\nIn this quadrant the university will be able to \u2018keep up\u2019 with the increasing uptake\nof e-learning and offer acceptable online learning to students. The university will then\nbe in a good position to expand into new locations, respond to funding opportunities\nand into new types of courses.\nQuadrant Two\nThe upper right-hand quadrant (existing mission\/new technologies) addresses the\nmany new learning and mobile technologies now available. However, most of the\nnewer widely used technologies such as Smart phones, I-Pods, and GPS applications\nhave not been developed for learning and need good understanding of potential\nteaching applications to be successful in new contexts. These technologies are\ncurrently considered peripheral. Some, however, may become core in the near\nfuture.\nThe implications of wireless networking are that, because content and communi-\ncation is available anywhere, learning is no longer tied to a particular location. As\nmore standardized encoded and syndicated content delivery becomes readily avail-\nable, there will be little, if any, limitation on the place or manner in which learning\nmay be available.\nMany new technologies are appropriate for off-campus use, as combinations and\nblends, for dynamic delivery of content and for human intervention and support of\ndistance learning. There are new understandings of the use of knowledge creation,\nsharing and repositories that can be deployed. Many technologies can be channelled\nthrough the VLE but are not limited by the obvious VLE operations.\nPedagogies in this quadrant need more exploration than those in quadrant one but\nit is still possible to imagine a migration between flapping and flying. Clearly small-\nscale pilots need to be undertaken that focus on the changing nature of pedagogy,\nrather than rampantly developing more and more technological features. In this\nquadrant, the university can be confident in offering small-scale pilots with existing\nstudents and clients, with a view to developing appropriate e-learning pedagogy\nthrough evaluation, feedback and research. Staff development and new systems and\nprocesses will be necessary for scaling-up of offerings.\nQuadrant Three\nThe lower left-hand box (existing pedagogies and technologies\/new missions and\nmarkets) represents using learning technologies to address different and new markets,\nmissions, levels and disciplines of learning and teaching (compared with quadrant\none) but using the core expertise and technologies already developed. Realistic\napproaches must be taken to the market to reduce risks as far as possible. As e-learn-\ning depends on volume, there should be a minimum contracted commitment before\nnew e-learning processes are developed. In this quadrant, marketing can take place to\n214 G. Salmon\nnew countries or through new distribution channels with some confidence in the e-\nlearning process.\nLearning objects\u2014a piece of digital resource, broken into small reusable chunks,\nthat can promote learning\u2014clearly fit into this quadrant, as they can be used in a wide\nvariety of circumstances. Similarly the use of personal repositories, wikis and blogs\ncan be a system for managing and sharing both pedagogical and content knowledge\nacross a wide range of new missions.\nThere is an opportunity in quadrant three to use web-based technologies such as\nVLEs to enable \u2018joining up\u2019 of e-resources across the university community to enable\nstudents to make stronger and easier connections between the subject areas they\nstudy and the services they can use. An aspiration for this quadrant could be to ensure\nthat every student of a university, regardless of location or mode of learning, receives\nequivalent services and learning experiences.\nQuadrant Four\nThe lower right-hand box (new\/new) is the most challenging, risky and potentially\nrewarding. Research projects about e-learning are being published that go beyond the\nsimplistic \u2018what works\u2019 scenarios of stage one of technology introduction. They need\nexploring and bringing together into usable principles and understandings along with\nappreciation of their transferability into teaching and innovation in a university. This\nquadrant offers the greatest potential to successfully put a university on the e-learning\nmap.\nClearly the technologies here will be peripheral but the research will position the\nuniversity well for developing local expertise, capabilities and competencies should\nthey become core in the future through diversification. The university should allow\nnew strategies to emerge to support an assessment of effective directions and the asso-\nciated risks.\nEngagement with this quadrant will require each university to continually scan\nboth the technology and marketing environment and develop one or two innovative\nprojects or seek several smaller ones using peripheral technologies.\nDiscussion\nYou have seen some of the films of humans\u2019 early attempts to fly\u2014early adopters of\ne-learning had a similar tendency to flap their wings. They fell into two main catego-\nries. Some assumed that the cyber environment is much the same as earth-bound\nlearning and simply required better motivation for those along for the ride. Tell that\nto the first victims of powered flight! Others observed the key aspects of learning in\nthe classroom and burnt out their human pilots by insisting they work harder and\nlonger to make mediocre design succeed.\nIf we avoid sliding assumptions about pedagogy around from one technological\nenvironment to the other then we quickly find out that teaching online has almost\nnothing to do with computers and everything to do with time, motivation, knowledge\nStrategic framework for e-learning and pedagogical innovation 215\nand the new agency of cyber-experience, as well as good, appropriate teaching. We\nneed to understand the appropriateness of the application and the deep-rooted\nchange processes that lay alongside them so they will succeed in their objectives.\nBroad areas now to be addressed should include the development of concepts,\ntheories and rigorous and appropriate methodologies, identification, promotion and\nsupport of good practice and models of change related to human intervention and\nsustainability. In addition, focusing on e-learning is a key way of providing for multi-\ndisciplinary and interdisciplinary research agendas in the applications of core and\nperipheral learning technologies and the associated innovative pedagogy.\nIt is true that, in a virtual environment, academics are denied the ability to \u2018wing it\u2019\nthat comes with the territory of face-to-face classes and instead need to articulate and\nplan exactly what it is that they do to create those magic moments that otherwise\nappear to occur \u2018naturally\u2019. However, once their strategy, tactics and craft are\nsurfaced and polished, they gain, or regain, a new level of e-self-assurance. Flapping\nis reduced and confidence returns.\nConclusions\nThe e-learning and pedagogical innovation framework at Leicester provided an\nappropriate platform for the hundreds of formal and informal discussions needed to\ndevelop an e-learning strategy for the university. The strategy was adopted by the\nUniversity Senate, with a detailed costed implementation plan in July 2005. As I\nwrite, implementation has commenced and evaluation processes are in place. I offer\nthe framework here for feedback, critique and exploration by others. I hope that it will\nprovide an example of an attempt to capture the complexity of developing and imple-\nmenting an e-learning strategy and that it will contribute to the understanding of\nchange processes in HEIs associated with the introduction of ICT in learning and\nteaching. It is also intended as a pointer away from the technology-driven focus on e-\nlearning to date, which has clearly resulted in flapping not flying. New approaches are\nso much needed if e-learning is to succeed in becoming successfully embedded in\nHEIs to the benefit of learners and teachers alike, and within a climate of promoting\ne-learning and teaching research.\nReferences\nAsh, C. & Bacsich, P.

Salmon\nAppendix 1\nFrom the DFES e-learning Strategy 15th March 2005: Transforming learning \nand children\u2019s services.\nTechnology has been used in education for many years. It has not yet transformed\nteaching and learning, but it has made a major impact in many schools, colleges and\nuniversities. It has also made information more accessible and administration more\nefficient. We can achieve more in Higher Education by: \n\u25cf Ensuring that research in e-learning and the pedagogy of subject teaching is given\nfull recognition\n\u25cf Incorporating the use of online learning into new staff courses and other staff\ndevelopment\n\u25cf Development programmes to encourage the wider use of ICT to promote individ-\nual learning\nwww.dfes.gov.uk\/publications\/e-strategy\/\nHEFCE E-learning Strategy 9th March 2005: HEFCE strategy for e-learning\n\u201cAlthough there has been rapid development [of ICT] in HE, our evidence base and\nresponses to our consultation suggest that institutions are still struggling to \u2018normal-\nize\u2019 e-learning as part of higher education processes. It is timely to \u2026 support the\nsector further in taking best advantage of these developments.\u201d\n\u201cThat does not mean telling universities and colleges what their aims for e-learning\nshould be, nor how they should go about reaching them. But it is about describing\noverall aspirations for how e-learning can transform learning and teaching, and about\nsupporting institutions in setting their own visions and plans.\u201d\n"}
