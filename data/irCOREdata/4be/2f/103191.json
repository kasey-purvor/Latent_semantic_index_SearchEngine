The number of national parks in Vietnam has increased from three  to  thirty  since\nthe  beginning  of  the  \u201crenovation\u201d  policy  of  doi  moi  in  1986  and  Vietnam   has   gained   an\ninternational reputation as a destination for exotic nature-based tourism  (Luong  (1999).  National\nand local government bodies, public and private interests, and domestic and foreign  organisations\nare all involved in various ways in tourism development in these areas. The open door  policy  has\nhad a marked effect on national parks in Vietnam, particularly by encouraging the involvement  of\nforeign NGOs whose conservation and restoration  initiatives  have  brought  new  criteria,  funds,\nideas and ways of doing things to the parks. In the context of Vietnam\u2019s transition,  brought  about\nin part by the country\u2019s \u201copen door\u201d policy of doi moi, this paper explores the  issues  and  defines\nand assesses the roles taken by public and private actors in the  development  and  management  of\nnational parks.\nNational Parks\nNations may have various reasons  for  establishing  national  parks,  including  protection,\npreservation, conservation, economic potential, regional development and provision for recreation\n(Butler and Boyd, 2000: 9). In the case of  the  earliest  national  parks  in  the  United  States  and\nAustralia, the land set aside was  commonly  not  arable  land,  and  therefore  \u2018useless\u2019  in  normal\neconomic terms. As the land was already held by the government,  parks  could  be  established  at\nlow initial cost (Hall, 2000: 33). Because these earliest national parks  were  usually  quite  distant\nfrom  population  centres,  development  of  the  parks  was  highly  dependent   on   provision   of\ntransport, normally railway access (Butler and Boyd, 2000: 19-20).\nWhile the original impetus for the establishment of many of the first national parks may  have  been  tourism,\nthere  are  currently  other  arguments  for  their  establishment  and  maintenance.   National   parks   form   important\ncomponents in the preservation of natural ecosystems and habitats,  and  the  tourism  trade  attracted  by  these  parks\noften  becomes  an  important  part  of  the  local  economy,  especially  as  the  bases  for,  and  appeal  of,  traditional\nlivelihoods  dwindle.  Thus,  increased  demands  are  being  put  on  national  parks  to  fulfil  social,   economic   and\nenvironmental roles in the interest of sustainability (Field, 1997: 420-421). Developing countries have also found  that\nthe development of national parks can be a way to attract foreign aid from foundations such as the World  Wide  Fund\n(WWF) for Nature (Marsh, 1987: 31). With the advantages brought by  this  type  of  funding  come\nconcerns of \u2018cultural imperialism\u2019 imposed by the developed world on developing nations through\nsuch global organisations (Marsh, 1987: 35).\nDespite their acknowledged importance,  the  establishment  of  national  parks  is  more  problematic  in  the\ncurrent day than it ever has been before. Growing populations and dwindling resources lead to suggestions to put park\nland to \u2018productive\u2019 use, to be exploited either for its natural resources  or  developed  for  more  intensive  public  use\n(Dennerlein, 1997: 47-48). These demands  are  countered  by  appeals  for  the  important  role  of  national  parks  as\nprecious remnants of shrinking habitats and ecosystems and calls for the exclusion of excessive  disturbances  to  their\npristine natural state.\nThe Relationship Between Tourism and National Parks\nTourism played an important role in the establishment of the first  national  parks,  both  in\nterms of gathering public interest in the project and in supporting their economic  viability  (Butler\nand Boyd, 2000: 9). National parks can raise the awareness of environmental  issues  amongst  the\nrelatively wealthy, educated and influential classes to which most  tourists  belong,  and  increased\ntourism  to  national  parks  can  also   encourage   government   involvement   in   preserving   the\nenvironments and wildlife that attract tourists (Lilieholm and Romney, 2000: 141). In  fact,  it  has\nbeen argued that public support for the concept of national parks is to a large degree contingent on\nallowing public access to these lands,  and  that  the  idea  of  a  national  park  without  tourism  is\ntherefore untenable (Butler, 2000: 331). In the case of \u2018representative\u2019 landscapes,  as  opposed  to\n\u2018spectacular\u2019  landscapes,  the  presence  of  tourism  could  even  be  seen   as   the   most   salient\ndistinction between a national park and its surroundings, and thus  the  most  defensible  argument\nfor the uniqueness of the park and the best argument for its protection (Butler, 2000: 331).\nFor countries with a heritage of spectacular landscape, national  parks  often  provide  iconic  images  for  the\ngovernment\u2019s international  tourism  promotion,  as  in  the  case  of  the  Australian  Tourist  Commission  and  many\nregional commissions within  the  country  (Hall,  2000:  29).  New  Zealand\u2019s  distinctive  image  as  a  \u2018clean  green\u2019\ndestination is supported by its national parks, making the maintenance of these  parks  crucial  to  the  integrity  of  the\ncountry\u2019s identity in the tourism destination market (Booth and Simmons, 2000: 37).\nIn  developing  countries,  the  establishment  of  national  parks  in  conjunction  with  well-planned  wildlife\ntourism can provide a region with tourism income that proves more lucrative than other uses to which the land  would\notherwise be put (Lilieholm and Romney, 2000: 137). Though tourism in  national  parks  may  provide  an  economic\nboon for surrounding communities, one should be wary of allowing a situation in which the local  economy  is  overly\ndependent on tourism as an economic sector (Field, 1997: 421).\nConflicts of Tourism in National Parks\nButler (2000: 333)  has  argued  that  the  effects  of  human  use  on  the  ecologies  within\nnational parks is perhaps the most important, and the most neglected, aspect of ecological research\nin these parks. Dearden has  identified  the  internal  contradiction  between  the  conservation  and\nrecreation functions of national parks as one of three classes of \u2018resource  conflicts\u2019  that  occur  in\nthese areas. The second type of conflict is caused by illegal appropriation of  the  park\u2019s  resources\nby outside factors, such as poaching, illegal logging and agricultural uses. Although these uses are\nsometimes tolerated in the interest of conciliation with the local  inhabitants,  the  illegal  activities\nare  often  not  a  case  of  subsistence  behaviour  by  indigenous  people  but  are  motivated   and\norchestrated by the greed of influential figures at the local or  even  national  level  in  business  or\ngovernment. The third type of resource conflict arises from activities  that  take  place  outside  the\npark but affect the park. An example of this is the overdevelopment of  areas  at  a  park  perimeter\nthat leads  to  air  pollution  or  interference  with  waterways  that  flow  into  or  out  of  the  park\n(Dearden, 2000).\nRelations with Local People\nNational parks are often used by governments as reserves for indigenous populations.  Hall\nhas used examples in Australia and New Zealand to demonstrate how the  contact  between  native\npeople and tourism that occurs in national parks can lead to  better  accommodation  of  aboriginal\nissues  in  tourism  planning,  a  more  positive  tourism  image  of  aboriginal  culture  and   better\ndissemination of knowledge and  involvement  in  tourism  amongst  indigenous  people  (cited  in\nBooth and Simmons, 2000: 53).\nAlthough far from universally  successful,  programmes  for  the  involvement  of  local  communities  in  the\nmanagement of national parks, and  provision  of  opportunities  for  them  to  profit  economically  from  tourism  are\nbecoming widespread. At the price of acceding  some  power  and  control  to  the  local  community,  such  initiatives\nreinforce the efficacy of the park authority, while affecting locals\u2019 view of conservation by making them aware of  the\nconcrete advantages to be gained by sustainable practices.\nProcesses of Interaction in National Parks\nAs already noted above, tourism can play a mediating role between  the  interests  of  the  park\nmanagement and locals. Butler and Boyd have examined how the  modes  of  interaction  between\nthese three factors of tourism, parks and local  communities  affect  different  aspects  of  the  park\nenvironment. In their analysis, human-initiated changes to the landscape are largely determined by\nthe  interaction  between   tourism   and   parks,   the   relationship   between   tourism   and   local\ncommunities deal with local involvement and economic benefits and multipliers,  parks  and  local\ncommunities interact in the realm of conservation and  other  policy  and  decision-making  issues.\nAll three interests interact on questions of development  and  issues  of  stakes  and  interests.  The\noutcomes of these interactions can take one of three general directions:\n\u2022 a \u2018win-win-win\u2019 condition  in  which  the  park  management  supports  tourism  initiatives\nwhich  in  turn  bolster  the  park  management\u2019s  effectiveness  and  locals  learn  that   the\npractice of conservation encourages tourism trade from which they directly benefit\n\u2022 a \u2018win-win-lose\u2019 scenario in which two of the three sectors benefit at the expense of the other  one,  as  is  the\ncase when increased development benefits tourism and local businesses to the detriment of the park or  when\nconservation measures benefit tourism and the park without furthering local economic interests\n\u2022  a  \u2018lose-lose-lose\u2019  situation  from  which  none  of  the  three   interests   benefit,   as   when   environmental\ndegradation of the park discourages tourism, thus removing economic benefits to the local community.\nObviously, any long-term viable future for national parks must provide sufficient benefits  for  all  three  types  of\nstakeholders. This can help guarantee a sustainable form of development that is in the interest of the area as  a  whole,\nunderstood as a composite of human and natural systems. These processes of interaction  in  the  specific  scenario  of\npresent-day Vietnam will be discussed in the next section.\nVietnam\u2019s Protected Areas\nHistory of Vietnam\u2019s Protected Natural Areas Through Doi Moi\nIn 1943, during the French colonial era, about 43 per cent of Vietnam was still covered  by\nforests (Vu Quy, 1995: 169). On December 1st 1945,  President  Ho  Chi  Minh  signed  Ordinance\nNo. 49, transferring the management of the Forest Service and the  Forest  Protection  Department\nto the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1962, Cuc Phuong was designated as Vietnam\u2019s first \u2018Prohibited\nForest\u2019 to protect it from exploitation. It  was  re-designated  as  Vietnam\u2019s  first  national  park  in\n1966.\nDuring the US\/Vietnam war, the extensive use of herbicides  by  American  forces   affected  16  per  cent  of\nSouth Vietnam\u2019s area, including more than one-third of its mangrove forests  (Cresswell  and  Maclaren,  2000:  290).\nEven since the end of the war, human activity has continued to decimate Vietnam\u2019s  natural  habitats.  It  is  estimated\nthat, between 1943 and 1994, forested land in Vietnam decreased from 14,325,000 hectares to 8,631,000, representing\na reduction in coverage from 43.7 per cent to 26.1 per cent of the total country (Luong, 1997: 105).\nIn 1985 the Vietnamese \u2018National Conservation Strategy\u2019  (NCS)  was  issued  (Tran  Lien\nPhong, 1995: 183). By 1986, there were eighty-seven  \u2018Prohibited  Forests\u2019  in  Vietnam  (Nguyen\nMau  Tai,  1995:  164).  A  Biodiversity  Action  Plan  (BAP)  was  enacted   by   the   Vietnamese\ngovernment in 1995 in reaction to the issuing of the Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  by  the\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (Rambaldi et al,  2001:  44).  This  appears  to  have  had\npositive effects for conservation as forested areas in Vietnam currently cover 11,784,589 hectares,\nequivalent to 35.8 per cent of the country (Management Strategy for a Protected Areas  System  to\n2010, 2003: 19). Despite this, the natural environment is still under severe pressure in  places  and\ntwenty per cent of the world\u2019s  endangered  primate  species  can  be  found  in  Vietnam  (Rogers,\n2002).\nThis paper focuses on Vietnam\u2019s national parks. According  to  the  \u201cManagement  Strategy  for  a  Protected\nArea System in Vietnam to 2010\u201d, a national park is defined as \u201ca natural area of land  and\/or  sea,  of  sufficient  area\nfor the protection of one or more specific, unmodified or slightly modified ecosystem and  its  endemic  or  threatened\nplant and animal species for present  and  future  generations.  A  national  park  provides  a  foundation  for  spiritual,\nscientific, educational, recreational and low impact ecotourism opportunities\u201d (2003: 95).  In  2007  there  were  thirty\nnational parks in Vietnam.\nManagement Structure and Responsibilities\nSeveral  ministries  and  agencies  are  involved  with  National  Parks   in   Vietnam.   The\nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) is responsible for  the  overall  direction\nof the system of Special-use Forests (SUFs) including national  parks.  The  Ministry  of  Planning\nand Investment  (MPI)  is  in  charge  of  annual  budgeting  and  funding.  The  Vietnam  National\nAdministration of Tourism (VNAT) is in charge  of  developing  Vietnam\u2019s  tourism  strategy  and\npromoting the country\u2019s national parks as tourist destinations among other tourist sites. The Forest\nProtection Department (FPD) under the MARD assists its ministry by  playing  a  monitoring  and\nprofessional management role.\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Decision No. 08\/2001\/QD-TTG, dated January 11,  2001  decentralised  administration\nof SUFs to put control of most of the  individual  parks  at  the  provincial  level,  with  the  MARD  playing  a  master\nplanning role. Eight national parks that are of special importance or that overlap  provinces  are  administered  directly\nby the MARD (Management Strategy for a Protected Area System in Vietnam to 2010, 2003: 26-27).\nFunding\nFunding for SUFs comes from various governmental sources and is not consolidated into a\nsingle budget (ICEM, 2003: 26). Most protected areas receive a small budget from the province in\nwhich they are located.  The  management  budget  for  protected  areas  comes  from  the  MARD\n(Rambaldi et al, 2001: 50), but infrastructure development tends to take priority over conservation\nmeasures in funding  allocation  (ICEM,  2003:  26).  Because  of  a  relative  lack  of  government\nfunding, many of the funds for conservation management  in  Vietnam  since  doi  moi  have  been\nprovided  by  international   conservation   organisations   such   as   WWF,   IUCN   and   Birdlife\nInternational (Nguyen Nhu Phuong and  Vu  Van  Dung,  2001).  McElwee  (2001)  has  cynically\nidentified such funding as  a  new  and  lucrative  source  of  income  for  the  government.  As  an\nillustration, the money obtained from international donors over a few years up to 2001 for  the  Vu\nQuang Nature Reserve alone  was  ten  times  the  government  budget  for  all  protected  areas  in\nVietnam in 1991 (McElwee, 2001: 10).\nLand Use Conflicts\nVietnam\u2019s forested land is divided  into  the  categories  of  Protection  Forest,  Special-use\nForest and Production Forest. Most production forest  was  managed  by  State-Forest  Enterprises\nuntil 1997, when the Vietnamese government eliminated logging activities in 300 of the 400 State-\nforest enterprises because degradation of forest resources and the inaccessibility  of  commercially\nvaluable forest stands had compromised their viability. Most State-Forest Enterprises moved from\nproduction to protection forestry (ICEM, 2003:19). For example, the Vu  Quang  Nature  Reserve,\nfamous as the home of a number  of  recently-discovered  previously  unknown  mammal  species,\nwas  formed  from  economically  defunct  State-Forest  Enterprise  land   (McElwee,   2001:   10).\nConservation continues to come into conflict  with  other  aspects  of  Vietnam\u2019s  development,  as\nwas the case in the 2001 approval to run a section  of  the  planned  north-south  national  highway\nthrough Cuc Phuong Park (New Vietnam Highway May Cut Through  National  Park,  2001)  and\nthe granting of approval to raze part of the protected forest of Thu Duc near Ho Chi Minh  City  to\nbuild a golf course (Rakthammachat, 1993).\nEco-tourism in Vietnam\nThe Vietnamese government has declared nature-based tourism to be one of  the  country\u2019s\nkey tourism products for development. The open door policy has encouraged  the  participation  of\nforeign NGOs in Vietnam\u2019s natural areas and allowed the growth of eco-tourism to the country by\nallowing foreign investment in  the  country  and  actively  promoting  tourist  visitation.  National\nparks are the sites of many  of  Vietnam\u2019s  natural  attractions  and  ecosystems  and  an  important\nfocus when studying these developments.\nA national workshop on \u2018Eco-tourism Development in Vietnam\u2019 in September 1999, organised by the World\nConservation Union (IUCN), the Economic and Social Commission Asia Pacific (ESCAP) and the Vietnam  National\nAdministration of Tourism (VNAT), was an important step in introducing the concepts and  practices  of  eco-tourism\nto Vietnam (Wurm, 2000: 14).\nAccording to Luong (1999: 15) 420,000 of the 1.52 million of foreign  visitors  to  Vietnam  in  1998  visited\nnatural sites in the country (Vietnam Investment Review, quoted in Wurm, 1999: 14). The Revised National  Tourism\nDevelopment Plan for Vietnam 2001-2010 proposes concentrating  on  the  development  of  ecotourism  and  village-\nbased tourism in remote areas as an important part of the country\u2019s diversified tourism product (2001:  15).  However,\nwhat currently passes for eco-tourism in Vietnam  could  more  accurately  be  called  \u201cnature-based\u201d  tourism  (Phan,\nQuan and Le, 2002), often in the form of organised mass-tourism that  does  not  satisfy  the  criteria  of  ecologically-\nminded  tourism.  Ceballos-Lascurain  defined   eco-tourism   as   \u201cTourism   that   involves   travelling   to   relatively\nundisturbed or uncontaminated areas with the specific objective of studying, admiring, and enjoying  the  scenery  and\nits wild plants and animals, as well as any existing cultural manifestations (both past and present) found in these area\u201d\n(1991:25). Honey added that eco-tourism not only educate travellers, but also  provides  funds  for\nconservation and brings economic and political power to local communities (199:25).\nDespite the above developments, however, Vietnam cannot yet be said to  have  a  national\nstrategy for eco-tourism (Phan, Quan and Le, 2002). Environmental  awareness  and  ecologically-\nminded practice are still uncommon, within the government as well as amongst the populace.  The\nubiquitous litter at tourist sites and  the  common  practice  of  eating  wild  meat  in  natural  areas\nevince a low level of ecological awareness amongst Vietnamese tourists. Government indifference\nand corruption, lack of involvement of locals  in  planning  and  the  fact  that  most  promoters  of\ntourism tend to be large non-local  concerns  still  serve  as  barriers  to  eco-tourism  development\n(Wurm,  2000:  5,  20;   Cresswell   and   Maclaren,   2000:   294).   At   the   governmental   level,\nresponsibilities, interdependencies and interests are often indistinct or redundant, complicating the\nadministrative process and the efforts of conservation organisations  (Phan,  Quan  and  Le,  2002;\nWurm,  1999:17).  Guides,  administrators  and  other  staff  have  no  indigenous   knowledge   or\nknowledge of conservation, nor training in educating visitors  in  environmental  issues.  Some  90\nper cent of eco-tourist guides were found to lack sufficient  environmental  knowledge  in  a  2000\nsurvey (Luong, cited in Phan, Quan and Le, 2002). Fees or punishment for environmental  neglect\nare non-existent or not enforced and local communities still exist in a  state  of  poverty,  receiving\nvery few benefits from tourism in their area. Conservation issues may be seen as luxury items  and\nless urgent than other facets of development and modernisation in  a  developing  country  such  as\nVietnam.\nTo  elaborate  on  and  illustrate  some  of  these  issues,  the  paper  will  now  discuss  recent   changes   and\ndevelopments in two specific national parks, focusing on the effects of the doi moi policy on park management\nand use.\nMethodology\nResearch in  Vietnam  faces  certain  problems  relating  to  the  restrictive  policies  of  the\ncurrent regime, and there is still relatively  little  published  research  on  national  parks  and  eco-\ntourism in Vietnam. Many  researchers  and  scholars  have  referred  to  the  lack  of  reliable  and\naccurate basic statistical data on the development of tourism for Vietnam. (Lloyd, 2004;  Lloyd  et\nal, 2004; Mok and Lam, 1996; EIU, 1993; Henderson, 2000; Theuns, 1997). The open door policy\nhas seemingly brought  Vietnam\u2019s  communist  government  to  realise  the  need  to  improve  the\nreliability  and  availability  of  data  in  order  to  attract  potential  foreign   investors   who   need\ntrustworthy and consistent statistics as a basis for their development  strategies  (EIU,  1993;  Mok\nand Lam, 1996).\nIn October 2003, the lead author made the first field trip to Cat Tien National  Park  where  she  conducted  a\npilot study and undertook interviews with high ranking officers. A second field trip was carried out in early July  2004\nin Cat Tien National Park, Hanoi and Cuc Phuong National Park. During this  trip,  the  lead  author  interviewed  two\nadministrative officials at the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD),  a  representative  of  the\nVietnam National Park and Protected Area Association, three representatives  of  Cat  Tien  National  Park  and  two\nsenior top officers of Cuc Phuong National Park. The interview with the representatives of MARD\nfocused on obtaining an overview of the role of national  parks  within  Vietnam  as  a  whole  and\nunderstanding how different governmental bodies work together at the national level to  affect  the\noperating environment of the parks. It  was  considered  best  to  interview  officials  at  individual\nnational  parks  to  gain  insight  into  how  national  and  local  policy  combine  with  private  and\ninternational interests in the actual day-to-day experience of running specific parks.\nA semi-structured interview was undertaken, involving the implementation of  a  number  of  pre-determined\nquestions and\/or special topics, asked of  each  interviewee  in  a  consistent  and  systematic  order,  but  allowing  the\ninterviewer sufficient freedom to  digress  in  order  to  probe  beyond  the  immediate  answers  to  the  predetermined\nquestions. Multiple lines of questioning of different interviewees at different levels were used  to  validate  and  cross-\ncheck interview results, including the interviewing of national park administrators as well as administrative figures  of\nMARD regarding the development of the national parks and tourism development in  national  parks.  Representatives\nof government bodies were often in a position  to  verify  the  results  of  interviews  with  representatives  of  the  two\nnational parks and data from other primary sources.\nInformation gathered from primary  sources  through  on-site  research  and  interviews  was  combined  with\nbackground information from secondary sources to create a consolidated depiction of the  subject  being  investigated.\nDesk research from secondary sources, including government documents, newspapers and  periodicals,  supplemented\nthe information gathered from the interviews.\nCase Study 1: Cuc Phuong National Park\nCuc Phuong National Park is the oldest and most developed of  Vietnam\u2019s  national  parks.\nIt is located about 130 kilometres southwest of Hanoi. The Park\u2019s total area is 22,200  hectares.  In\n1989, a very rare endemic monkey, the Delacour\u2019s Langur, was rediscovered in  Cuc  Phuong  and\nbecame the \u2018flagship-species\u2019 of the Park  (Tilo,  1995:  192-193).  The  Park  is  home  to  diverse\nfauna including 71 types of mammal, 319 birds, 33 reptiles, 16 amphibians and almost 2,000 plant\ntypes, or 68.9 per cent of all Vietnamese flora  species  (National  Parks  of  Vietnam,  2001:  112-\n113). The Park has three principal functions: nature conservation, scientific  research  and  tourism\n(Management Plan Draft Outline: Cuc Phuong National Park 1998-2008, 1998: 7).  In  contrast  to\nthe original staff of only 20 soldiers and local  people  employed  as  rangers  (The  Saigon  Times\nDaily, 1998), by 2004 the tourism-related staff alone numbered 40 (Interview A, 2004).\nAlthough the local population provides a large pool of unskilled labour for the  Park,  most\nskilled workers must be brought in from outside the area, lessening the potential economic benefit\nto residents of the region (Management Plan Draft Outline: Cuc Phuong National Park 1998-2008,\n1998: 41). Since doi moi, fewer staff members are officials and more are employed from the  local\npopulation and  other  non-governmental  sectors.  The  contact  system  is  no  longer  exclusively\nthrough government channels but often through local or staff contacts (Interview A, 2004).\nThe borders of the Park are presently unmarked, causing confusion  among  local  communities  as  to  which\nareas are under the jurisdiction of  the  Park  management.  Cooperation  and  communication  between  the  Park  and\nregional authorities is poor. Lack of support by regional authorities has blocked the effectiveness of  the  ranger  force\nto protect Cuc Phuong. The provincial  Forest  Protection  Department  also  sometimes  turns  a  blind  eye  to  illegal\nactivities (Management Plan Draft Outline: Cuc Phuong National Park 1998-2008, 1998: 10-38).\nTourism in Cuc Phuong National Park\nAttractions in the Park  include  a  community  based  adventure  tourist  trail,  the  tourism\nvillage Khan hamlet, an Endangered Primate Rescue Centre and several temples.\nBefore doi moi, Cuc Phuong National Park received only  a  small  number  of  visitors  who\nwere mostly from the government or official organisations. There were no admission fees  and  no\ncharge for accommodation or the basic services that existed at  that  time.  In  1990,  however,  the\nPark was unable to provide free services to the increasing number of tourists and began  to  charge\nfees,  which  went  into  paying  taxes  and  developing  tourism  and   conservation   in   the   Park\n(Interview A, 2004).\nIn the 1980s, Cuc Phuong National Park received an annual average of  2,045  visitors,  25\nper cent of whom were students and pupils (Szaniawski, 1987:  15).  In  1994,  there  were  21,795\ndomestic visitors and 1,472 foreign visitors,  which  rose  to  52,009  domestic  and  4,227  foreign\ntourists in 2003 (Interview B, 2004), an overall increase of over 140 per cent. On a  busy  day,  the\nPark can receive up to 3,500 visitors. However, according to a local newspaper,  the  Head  of  the\nManagement Board of the Park, Mr. Dao Van Khuong, admitted that the actual  carrying  capacity\nof the Park is about 300 visitors per day (Vietnam News Briefs, 2002a).\nEcological Issues of Tourism in the Park\nThe increase in numbers of visitors has also created problems for  the  Park\u2019s  management\nthrough the large amount of waste they produce, their collecting of plants,  and  the  noise  created\nby large groups (Management Plan Draft Outline: Cuc Phuong  National  Park  1998-2008,  1998:\n33).  Some  of  the  Park  management\u2019s  own  policies  and  initiatives  in  the  name   of   tourism\ndevelopment have  also  been  realised  at  the  expense  of  the  preservation  of  biodiversity.  For\ninstance, in order  to  improve  the  roads  inside  the  Park,  trees  were  cut  down.  Similarly,  the\ncreation of artificial lakes inside the Park required forest clearance  and  resulted  in  alterations  to\nthe local hydrology. The Park staff have also paved tourist trails and added concrete  steps,  which\nare  eyesores  in  the  opinion  of  conservationists  (Interview  H,  2005).  The  Park   management\ndirectly supports  and  encourages  noisy  activities  by  offering  entertainment  facilities  such  as\nkaraoke (Vietnam News Briefs, 2002a). According to a survey on  the  impact  of  tourists  on  the\nPark, 87% of 100 visitors remarked on the degradation caused by litter left by tourists (Rugendyke\nand Nguyen Thi Son, 2005: 197).\nMinistry of Forestry Official Letter No. 551 LN\/KL dated 21 March 1994, was  distributed\nto provincial and municipal committees to provide directives for \u201cstrictly  implementing\u201d  wildlife\nprotection laws. Among the tasks delegated  to  the  People\u2019s  Committees  was  to  \u201c(i)nstruct  the\nforestry  institutions,  Forest  Protection  Department,  Customs  office,  tax  services,  and  market\nmanagement of the province (to) prohibit in  (sic)  hotels,  restaurants  to  advertise  and  serve  the\nfood cooked from wildlife or their products\u201d.  Regardless of these prohibitions, various restaurants\nin one of the villages near Cuc Phuong National Park advertise their wildlife dishes  freely.  Some\nrestaurants openly display baby wild animals with herbs and alcohol in jars.\nThe  greatest  current  threat  to  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  Park   comes   from   an\ninitiative of the Vietnamese government itself. The new Ho Chi Minh National Highway links  the\nsouth and north  of  the  country  and  runs  along  the  Buoi  River  valley  bisecting  Cuc  Phuong\nNational Park.  The  manager  of  conservation  programmes  at  the  Park  has  said  that  the  new\nhighway will make the  Park  more  accessible  for  loggers  and  hunting  (Cox,  2001).  The  new\nhighway also greatly increases the accessibility of  the  Park  to  tourists  and  can  be  expected  to\nencourage further acceleration of growth of visitor numbers in coming years.\nTourism Planning, Development and Investment\nThe  former  Director  of  Cuc  Phuong  National  Park  has  clearly  stated  his  belief   that\naccessibility,  including  good  road   access   and   availability   of   communications   technology,\ndetermines the attractiveness of the Park to  tourists  above  all  other  factors  (Hoang  Van  Than,\n1997: 120). Others (Pham Trung Luong and  Nguyen  Tai  Cung,  1997:  104),  have  indicated  an\nassumption that a higher degree of development  attracts  more  tourism  and  thus  more  revenue.\nThis bias is evident in the aforementioned arguably ill-advised developments in the Park,  such  as\na swimming pool and a karaoke facility. In a continuation  of  this  trend,  Ninh  Binh  province  is\nseeking private investment of over US$ 3 million for the construction of a bathing lake within Cuc\nPhuong National Park (Vietnam News Briefs, 2002b).\nLack of coordination between entities involved in the Park is  a  major  barrier  to  appropriate  development.\nCooperation between the Park and the local community  is  lacking  (Management  Plan  Draft  Outline:  Cuc  Phuong\nNational Park 1998-2008, 1998: 40). Previously, an antagonistic relationship seems to have existed between  the  Park\nmanagement and the Muong people resident in the Park, who removed notice boards from tourist areas and  destroyed\narticles in the Park  out  of  resentment  for  being  prohibited  from  pursuing  their  slash-and-burn  forestry  practices\n(Szaniawski, 1987: 22). Perceived imposition of foreign values on the Muong people by NGOs  in  the  course  of  the\nresettlement programme may also have fuelled this protest. Relations between the Park  management  and  indigenous\npopulations can be seen to have  improved  in  some  aspects  since  then.  Improved  water  supply  and  road  access,\nelectricity generators and agricultural initiatives, funded by more than VND 300 million  of  government  funds,  have\nbenefited the entire community (Le Van Lanh, 1997: 123-126).\nPrivate involvement in Cuc Phuong began after the introduction of doi moi  and  has  been  increasing.\nSince doi moi, government funding for the Park has fluctuated and has been primarily confined  to\ninfrastructure  improvements  forcing  the  Park  management  to  find  new  sources  of  funds  for\nconservation and tourism development (Interview F, 2004). For this  reason,  many  of  the  Park\u2019s\nservice operations that have sprung up since doi moi, such as restaurants and a souvenir  shop,  are\nprivately run. The current Head  of  the  Park\u2019s  Tourism  Department  sees  private  enterprises  as\nmore   dynamic   than   government-provided   services   and   would   welcome   the   incremental\nintroduction of more private involvement in Cuc Phuong. International private tourism companies\nare also offering tours to the Park. The Dutch tour operators Savadi Tourism and  Amtour  tourism\nand the Asia Tourism Company of Spain have been bringing tourists to  Cuc  Phuong  since  1990\n(Hoang Van Than, 1997: 122).\nAnother form of outside involvement in the Park comes from NGOs. The Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the United Nations was among the first to be involved in  an  extended  (3  year)  project,  beginning  just  after  the\nintroduction of doi moi. Previous to doi moi, foreign organisations had been involved only  in  small-\nscale  activities.  The  language  barrier  and  differing  ways  of  doing  things   were   barriers   to\ncooperation at the  beginning  of  this  process,  but  are  gradually  being  overcome  (Szaniawski,\n1987).\nCase Study 2: Cat Tien National Park\nCat  Tien  National  Park  (CTNP)  is  situated  in  southern  Vietnam,  approximately   150\nkilometres north of Ho Chi Minh City and about 150 kilometres south  of  Dalat.  The  Park  has  a\ntotal area of 73,878 hectares (Conservation Management and Operational Plan Cat  Tien  National\nPark, 2003-2008). Cat Tien is the largest lowland tropical forest  of  southern  Vietnam.  The  Park\ncontains 1,610 identified plant species, some of them rare or endangered, as well  as  76  mammal,\n320 bird, 74 reptile, 35 amphibian and 99 fish species.  The  Park  is  known  to  accommodate  40\nspecies  which  are  listed  \u2018red\u2019  by  the  World  Conservation  Union  (IUCN),  for   example   the\nVietnamese  sub-species  of  the  Javan  Rhinoceros,  the  rarest  large  mammal  on  earth,  with  a\npopulation  of  less  than  7  found  in  Cat  Loc;  the  Orange-necked  Partridge  and  the   Siamese\ncrocodile (Conservation Management and Operational Plan Cat  Tien  National  Park,  2003-2008:\n2003:12).\nCat Tien National Park is one of the last remaining  largely  intact  lowland  forest  ecosystems  in  Southeast\nAsia. It could  also  become  the  only  protected  habitat  of  the  Siamese  crocodile,  if  attempts  to\nreintroduce  the  species  are  successful  (Conservation  Management  Plan  2000:  12).  Cat  Tien\nNational Park was named by UNESCO as the world\u2019s  411th  Man  and  Biosphere  Reserve  (Eco-\nTourism Development Plan Period 2003-2008, 2003: 2).\nCTNP is directly  administered  by  the  national  government  in  Hanoi.  The  Park  Director  reports  to  the\nnational government and has jurisdiction over minor activities within the Park.  A  representative  of  the  government\nvisits the Park on a yearly basis to monitor progress and to meet with the Park management team. The national  Forest\nProtection Department (FPD) in Hanoi visits and coordinates with the Park FPD (Interview C, 2003).\nTourism in Cat Tien National Park\nFew tourists came to the Cat Tien in 1992, the year of its establishment as a national  park.\nAt  that  time,  however,  there  were  neither  professional  tourism-related  staff  nor   appropriate\nfacilities for tourists (Interview D, 2004). The  number  of  tourists  who  visit  the  Park  increased\nsteadily from 2,200 (2,000 Vietnamese and 200 foreigners) in 1995 to 13,790 (12,844 Vietnamese\nand 946 foreigners) in 2002 (Eco-Tourism Development  Plan,  Period  2003-2008,  2003:  7).  To\nprotect the fragile ecosystem, tourist activities and facilities are restricted to  zones  located  in  the\nsoutheast of the Park. The Park has great difficulty dealing with large groups  of  visitors.  Despite\nofficial claims that all visitors must book in advance, and that tourists above the quota are  refused\nentry (Interview  E,  2003),  there  are  also  complaints  that  even  large  organised  groups  come\nunannounced, and the visitors and their leaders tend to ignore almost all park rules,  especially  the\nrules regarding littering and the use of  megaphones (Tourism Management Plan, 1999: 4).\nConservation has become an important issue in the  running  of  the  Park  in  recent  years  and  international\ncooperation projects have been achieving noticeable progress in the organisation and success of conservation  projects\n(Interview C, 2003). One such project was the Cat Tien National  Park  Conservation  Project  (CTNP-CP)  -  a  joint\ninitiative  of  the  Ministry  of  Agricultural  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)   and   the   Royal\nNetherlands Government \u2013 which took place  from  1998  to  2004.  The  second  project  was  the\nForest Protection and Rural Development Project (FPRDP) supported by a  loan  from  the  World\nBank (Conservation Management and Operational Plan Cat Tien National Park, 2003-2008: 10).\nTourism Planning, Development and Investment\nA proposed plan for the Cat Tien National Park  Conservation  Project  was  formulated  to\nrespond to the granting of Biosphere Reserve status to the  Park  by  UNESCO  on  November  10,\n2001.  Reiterating  and  building  upon  the  themes  outlined  in  previous   documents,   the   plan\nproposed the development of specific eco-tourism  opportunities  and  the  creation  of  two  major\nwildlife sanctuaries (Lebre, 2002). The document also proposed  the  extension  of  tours  into  the\nhighly sensitive Cat Loc area: a controversial decision due to the presence there of the endangered\nJava rhinoceros (Murphy, 2001).\nAlthough ecotourism is prioritised by the Vietnamese government, there is very  little  funding  available  for\nits development. Ecological tourism activities are regarded as businesses and are thus  expected  to  turn  a  profit  and\npay taxes (Interview, D, 2004). The tax collected however, can be deducted from the annual  state  budget  allotted  to\nthe Park (Interview G, 2004).\nTwo canteens in the Park were originally managed by the Park administration  but  failed  to  make  a  profit.\nThey are now both run by a private individual, who pays a part of the profit as rent. The Park continues to control  the\nprice and service. Boatmen on the river used to work for the Park, working office hours with very  inefficient  service,\nwhich caused problems for those wishing to cross the river late in the evening. Since they  were  granted  the  right  to\nwork for themselves, they have been working longer hours much more efficiently, and paying part of their profit back\nto the Park (Interview C, 2003).\nThe involvement of foreign  NGOs  in  development  and  investment  in  the  Park  has  made  an  important\ncontribution to awareness of ecotourism within the Park administration. The Head of the Park\u2019s  Tourism  Department\nhas  acknowledged  that  the  management  learns  much  about  ecotourism  from  contact  with  foreign  conservation\norganisations. For instance, Western organisations recommended the reduction of tour group sizes in order to improve\nthe quality of the contact with nature.\nConclusions\nThe number  of  national  parks  in  Vietnam  has  increased  greatly  during  the  period  of\npolitical transition since the beginning of doi moi. As has been  noted,  the  initiative  and  funding\nbehind the establishment of protected areas and national parks in  Vietnam  has  often  come  from\ninternational conservation organisations. Tourism seems  to  play  at  best  a  secondary  role  as  a\ndriving inspiration for the founding of parks, although the potential value of international  tourism\nto the parks (and Vietnam in general) is becoming more appreciated.\nThe growing involvement of  international  NGOs  in  Vietnam\u2019s  national  parks  has  brought  an  influx  of\nconservation and eco-tourism expertise. Although eco-tourism is  a  component  of  many  of  the  conservation  plans\ndrawn up for parks by NGOs, a lack of understanding or care about  the  issues  involved  on  the  part  of\nthose actually charged with carrying out the plans means that there are as yet no true  examples  of\nserious eco-tourism practices in Vietnamese parks or serious studies as to whether  eco-tourism  is\nin fact the only or most appropriate form of tourism.\nBefore  doi  moi,  tourism  to  national  parks   was   uncommon,   practiced   primarily   by\ngovernment officials or their guests and  fully  subsidised  by  the  state.  The  increase  in  tourism\nsince doi moi necessitated the formulation of a comprehensive tourism policy  for  protected  areas\nfor the first time.  With  the  rise  of  tourist  interest  in  natural  areas  since  doi  moi,  the  central\ngovernment did not develop a centralised policy for this but rather opted to delegate responsibility\nto the individual parks. With the  continuing  withdrawal  of  the  central  government  from  many\naspects of formulating and facilitating plans  for  national  parks,  international  NGOs,  with  their\nlarge budgets,  focused  agendas,  on-site  engagement  and  planning  proficiency,  have  come  to\nexercise an increasing influence over the policy of parks.\nPrivate enterprise has taken root in Vietnam\u2019s national parks as the result of relaxation of restrictions brought\nabout by doi moi. With the withdrawal of  government  subsidies  resulting  from  the  reforms,  park\nfacilities had to be re-invented as self-sustaining enterprises (a situation  not  uncommon  in  other\njurisdictions such as Canada (Boyd  and  Butler,  2009)).   However,  the  development  of  private\nenterprise around tourism in national parks is still at an  undeveloped  stage  and  small  scale  and\ndoes not display the diversity or competition that would normally characterise a service  economy.\nThere are some cases in which private tourism development interests have been  able  to  use  their\nfinancial  leverage  to  influence  decision-making  and  planning  in  parks,  such  as   the   private\nenterprise that convinced Ba Vi National Park to transport animals  to  a  part  of  the  park  it  had\nleased to develop this area as an eco-tourism zone (Interview G, 2004).\nThe development of tourism in national parks in Vietnam has been related to other aspects of development in\nthe country.  Vietnam\u2019s  national  parks  are  places  where  issues  of  tourism,  conservation  and  indigenous  people\nconfront one another in both conflict and cooperation. Of the three, tourism is the most obvious  sector  for  continued\ncommercial development and is thus well-positioned to serve as a catalyst for change that could benefit all interests in\nthe parks.\nThe interest in Vietnam evinced and encouraged by the involvement of organisations  such\nas WWF has raised global awareness of Vietnam\u2019s natural wildlife and landscape, propagating  an\nimage of the country as an untouched wilderness that appeals to many types of  tourists.  Although\nthere is very little understanding or interest on the part  of  the  government  in  developing  \u201cpure\u201d\neco-tourism in Vietnam, the \u2018eco\u2019 image and language have been  widely  adopted  by  public  and\nprivate operators for anything \u2018nature based\u2019.\nIn terms of Butler and  Boyd\u2019s  (2000)  three  possible  outcomes  of  interactions  between\nparks, tourism and local communities, the current state of the two  parks  investigated  in  the  case\nstudies in this paper seem to correspond at best to a \u2018win-win-lose\u2019 scenario in which tourism  and\nlocal  communities  benefit  at  the  expense  of  the  natural   environment.   A   more   pessimistic\nassessment could define the current  situation  as  a  \u2018win-lose-lose\u2019  scenario,  since  not  all  local\npeople benefit equally from tourism development. Some may feel  completely  by-passed  or  even\ndisadvantaged by development, such as those who are displaced from their  homes  or  livelihoods\nby the rules relating to tourism development in these parks. Government programmes seem  to  be\nbased on encouraging exploitation of the natural attractions of the areas to induce  economic  gain,\nwhile doing little to guarantee the protection of that environment or the long-term sustainability of\nthe economic or tourism practices that are being developed. A continuation of this  practice  could\nin the long term  lead  to  a  \u2018lose-lose-lose\u2019  situation  in  which  degradation  of  the  environment\ndevalues the basis of the local economy and tourism trade, in much the same way as  conventional\nmass tourism destinations eventually suffer decline from overuse and misuse (Butler 1980).\nAll three of Dearden\u2019s (2000) \u2018resource conflicts\u2019 can be observed  in  one  or  both  of  the\nparks discussed in this paper. An internal contradiction between  the  conservation  and  recreation\nfunctions is present in both parks, as can be seen in the disparity between the  ecological  goals  of\nNGOs involved in the parks  and  the  non-ecological  expectations  and  recreational  practices  of\ndomestic tourists to natural areas. Both parks also  suffer  from  poaching  of  wildlife  and  illegal\ncutting of plants, corresponding to Dearden\u2019s second type of conflict. The most  obvious  example\nof the third type of conflict, that of external forces having negative effects on the park, can be seen\nin  the  Ho  Chi  Minh  Highway  bisecting  Cuc  Phuong  National  Park  and   disturbing   natural\necosystems. Only the national Vietnamese government has the  power  and  jurisdiction  to  rectify\nsuch conflicts. The causes and mechanisms behind these conflicts are  embedded  in  political  and\ntouristic practices that extend beyond the boundaries of the parks, and to effectively address  these\nproblems would require a change in government culture as well  as  changes  in  the  behaviour  of\ntourists to these areas. Achieving such a transformation in attitudes and practices would inevitably\ninvolve multiple measures enacted over time. Defining which measures would  be  most  effective\nwould require further research based  on  detailed  surveys  and  observations  of  current  tourists\u2019\nattitudes and behaviour, as well as interviews and collaborative studies with governmental figures.\nIn  order  to  maintain  a  clear  delimitation  of  scope,  this  research  has  dealt   primarily   with   issues   of\ndevelopment and  management,  which  has  implied  a  concentration  on  certain  stakeholder  groups,  such  as  park\nmanagement and governmental bureaus. An effort has been made to acknowledge implications  for  other  stakeholder\ngroups, such as the local population, in broad terms, while  leaving  a  detailed  enquiry  into  the  point  of  view  of\nthese stakeholders for subsequent research. It is clear that future policy considerations would have\nto be informed by focused participatory studies into the potential  consequences  of  any  decisions\nfor the indigenous people.\nIn  general,  it  is  not  through  exertion  of  influence  but  rather  through  withdrawal  of  control   that   the\nVietnamese  central  government  has  enabled  and  encouraged   change   in   tourism   patterns   in   national   parks.\nInternational organisations and private enterprises have taken advantage of unprecedented possibilities opened  up  by\nthe removal of government restrictions and monopolies. International  NGOs  generally  are  interested  in  only  some\naspects of park development. The decentralisation of control  has  also  given  individual  parks  new  powers  of  self-\ndetermination, but there is little  evidence  of  vision  or  innovation  from  any  specific  park  management  authority.\nCurrently,  no  single  entity  or  interest  can  be  said  to  have  a  complete  vision  for,  or  complete  control  of,  the\ndevelopment of Vietnam\u2019s national parks. Doi moi has certainly brought a more  diverse  set  of  actors  to\nthe development of tourism within national parks, but an effective division of roles  that  will  lead\nto a consolidated tourism  development  policy  that  reflects  the  varying  needs  of  the  different\nelements has yet to emerge.\nReferences\nBooth, K., and Simmons, D.
