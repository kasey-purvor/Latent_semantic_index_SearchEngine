This growth has also been characterised by a \u2018splitting\u2019 process, \nwith the emergence of distinct sub-disciplines, most notably: Human Behavioural Ecology \n(HBE), Evolutionary Psychology (EP) and studies of Cultural Evolution (CE).  Multiple \napplications of evolutionary ideas to the human sciences are undoubtedly a good thing, \ndemonstrating the usefulness of this approach to human affairs. Nevertheless, this fracture \nhas been associated with considerable tension, a lack of integration, and sometimes outright \nconflict between researchers. In recent years however, there have been clear signs of hope \nthat a synthesis of the human evolutionary behavioural sciences is underway.  Here, we \nbriefly review the history of the debate, both its theoretical and practical causes; then provide \nevidence that the field is currently becoming more integrated, as the traditional boundaries \nbetween sub-disciplines become blurred. This article constitutes the first paper under the new \neditorship of the Journal of Evolutionary Psychology, which aims to further this integration \nby explicitly providing a forum for integrated work. \n \nKey Words: Human Behavioural Ecology, Evolutionary Psychology, Cultural Evolution \n \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n1. Introduction \nThe application of Darwinian thought to the human behavioural sciences, beginning \nin earnest with the publication of Wilson\u2019s Sociobiology: The New Synthesis in 1975, has had \na turbulent history. Sociobiology applies gene-level selectionist models directly to behaviour \nenabling both the explanation of the ultimate causes of behaviour, and the prediction of \nspecific behaviours under a variety of ecological conditions.  The rather hostile reception of \nthese ideas by the social sciences is well documented (see Segerstr\u00e5le 2000 for a excellent \naccount). Our concern here is not with the misinterpretation of evolutionary theory by the \nsocial sciences, but the \u2018splitting\u2019 process that the human evolutionary behavioural sciences \nhave undergone over the last three decades. Broadly speaking, three sub-disciplines have \nemerged: Human Behavioural Ecology (HBE), Evolutionary Psychology (EP) and studies of \nCultural Evolution (CE). This internal fracture has been tracked by a consistent flow of \npapers and books (Crawford 1993; Sherman and Reeve 1997; Daly and Wilson 1999; Heyes \n2000; Smith 2000; Smith et al. 2000; Downes 2001; Smith et al. 2001; Barrett et al. 2002; \nLaland and Brown 2002; Hutchinson and Gigerenzer 2005; Kaplan and Gangestad 2005; \nDunbar and Barrett 2007b; Gangestad and Simpson 2007a; White et al. 2007). See Table 1 \nfor a list of articles which have reviewed or attempted to synthesise these sub-disciplines, \nmany of which provide informative summaries of the key issues.  \n \nINSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nHere we provide our own overview of the key boundaries that have arisen, but \nemphasise that in recent years there is strong evidence that a reintegration of the discipline is \non the horizon. We argue that theoretical synthesis, while still far from ubiquitous, has \nbecome a significant feature of the contemporary literature. Traditional methodological \n 4 \nboundaries have also attenuated, and some genuinely integrated research programmes and \nresearch groups have arisen in recent years. We briefly consider the role of relevant studies \nbeyond our three-way split, and the rise of applied, rather than purely academic, studies, \nbefore concluding with some optimism that a synthesis of the human evolutionary \nbehavioural sciences is truly underway. We start with a brief description of each of the three \nsub-disciplines. \n \n2. The Three Approaches \n2.1 Human Behavioural Ecology \nHBE emerged directly from Sociobiology (Wilson 1975), inheriting a core concern with the \nultimate functions of behaviour rather than its underlying mechanisms. Throughout this \narticle, we concentrate on HBE as a subcategory of human evolutionary ecology (an umbrella \nterm including applications to non-behavioural aspects of the phenotype), as the focus of this \npaper is the behavioural sciences. However, we note that most of the points could be applied \nto human evolutionary ecology at large. \nHBE is concerned with explaining adaptive behavioural variation within its ecological \ncontext.  Organisms are understood to be attempting to maximize their fitness under specific \necological conditions.  Today, HBE remains virtually identical in approach to animal \nbehavioural ecology (e.g. Krebs and Davies 1993), using the same tools and techniques, such \nas optimality theory (Parker and Maynard Smith 1990), to generate testable predictions \n(Borgerhoff Mulder 1991; Cronk 1991; Winterhalder and Smith 2000). At the heart of HBE \nlies a black box approach to understanding the traits in question, referred to as the phenotypic \ngambit (a term first coined by Grafen, 1984). This assumes that there is some linkage \nbetween genes and behaviour, and therefore behaviour can be analysed in ultimate terms, but \nthe nature of this linkage is not an explicit concern. HBE explains behavioural variation using \n 5 \nthe concept of phenotypic plasticity, which assumes that the same genotype can give rise to \nmultiple phenotypes dependent on ecological conditions. Testing models requires that the \nfitness differentials associated with behavioural strategies are identified. As long-term fitness \nis difficult to measure directly, proximate outcomes are used as proxy measures, most \ncommonly number of children or grandchildren, but also alternative measures such as health \nor social status outcomes. Such models have performed well, and demonstrated predictive \npower in a variety of domains, such as foraging, mating and parental investment \n(Winterhalder and Smith 2000 for a review). \n \n2.2 Evolutionary Psychology \nIn contrast to the phenotypic gambit approach of HBE, the focus of EP is upon the \nproximate psychological mechanisms that cause behaviour. The broad conception of EP is \nthat proximate psychological mechanisms will be better understood in terms of their ultimate \nfunctions.  Put more prosaically, given that the brain is an evolved organ, there must be some \ninteresting theoretical constraints upon psychological theory from evolutionary biology.  \nUnder this formulation there is a lot of room for different approaches to the application of \nevolutionary biology to psychology, some of which would not necessarily be that removed \nfrom HBE.  This broad conception of EP is to be regarded as theoretically integrative.  \nHowever, one particular school of thought has dominated EP, which emerged primarily (but \nnot exclusively) from the University of California, Santa Barbara (Barkow et al. 1992).  This \nschool has actively sought to differentiate itself from HBE, principally on theoretical \ngrounds.  This distinction has been noted by a number of authors (e.g. Downes 2001; Gray et \nal. 2003; Buller 2005; Dunbar and Barrett 2007a), though it is not universally accepted within \nEP. Nonetheless, we find the distinction useful and will adopt Dunbar and Barrett\u2019s (2007a) \nterminology of EP sensu stricto (EPSS). \n 6 \nUnlike the broad conception of EP, EPSS has some firm views on the precise nature \nof psychological adaptations. EPSS characterises these adaptations as domain-specific, \nclaiming that this is a consequence of evolution by natural selection, for natural selection \nonly selects adaptations that solve specific problems (though see Atkinson and Wheeler, \n2004, for a discussion of degrees of domain specificity).  Given this, each psychological \nadaptation was selected to solve a particular ancestral problem, and as such each adaptation \nhas its own Environment of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA; pace Bowlby 1969) which is \nthe specific environment in which the adaptive problem presented itself and was solved.  In \nthe canonical book, The Adapted Mind (Barkow et al. 1992) this Pleistocene EEA epoch was \ndescribed as a period of sustained and consistent selection pressures. EPSS has now \nhypothesised specific mechanisms relating to such diverse factors as \u2013 fear of snakes, \ndetection of social cheats, language acquisition, preference for foods rich in fats and sugar, \nsex differences in sexual jealousy and mate preferences (relating to economic resources, age, \nattractiveness, body shape and sexual variety), and even landscape preferences for savannah \nlike environments (reviewed in Buss 1995). These mechanisms are seen as universal species-\ntypical adaptations with any cultural and individual differences explained by their regulated \ninteraction with local environmental conditions (Tooby and Cosmides 1992).  \nDomain-specificity was subsequently discussed in terms of cognitive modularity \n(Fodor 200; Atkinson and Wheeler 2004). The architectural descriptions given in The \nAdapted Mind conform to aspects of modularity theory in that they assume specific content \nand specific processing for each adapted mechanism. This has led some to refer to this \nposition as Darwinian Modularity, in contrast with Fodorian Modularity, which is process \nbased, and Chomskyan Modularity, which is content based (Samuels 1998; Samuels 2000). \nThe position EPSS takes on modularity is a consequence of theoretical commitments within \n 7 \ncognitive science (Dickins 2003). The idea that psychological adaptations are domain-\nspecific and modular is core to EPSS.   \n \n2.3 Cultural Evolution \nCE shares some important commonalities with both HBE and EP (Henrich and \nMcElreath 2003). Like HBE, CE is often concerned with the current adaptive utility of traits \n(although it has also considered the emergence of maladaptive behaviours: e.g. Boyd and \nRicherson 2005).  Like EP, it is also interested in the proximate mechanisms by which \nbehaviour is brought about, albeit specifically with mechanisms of social learning and \ntransmission of cultural traits rather than underlying cognitive apparatus. However, it differs \nfrom both in its conviction that a robust understanding of human behaviour requires explicit \nconsideration of cultural as well as genetic evolution. This focus on the cultural transmission \nof behavioural traits, studied at the within and between population level, sets CE apart from \nthe largely individual level work of the other two sub- disciplines. \nWe should note at this point that our tripartite split glosses over some distinct \ntraditions within CE, and that the field itself is not particularly unified. Many researchers \nstress a distinction between memetics and gene-culture coevolution (Laland and Brown \n2002). Broadly speaking, memetics considers cultural evolution to be entirely divorced from \nbiological evolution, though the evolution of cultural practices can be modelled along similar \nlines to those of genetic evolution (Aunger 2000). This branch of enquiry is a considerably \nsmaller area, and has come under harsh criticism for a number of controversial assumptions, \nand a reliance on purely theoretical application (see Laland and Brown 2002). We focus more \nspecifically on gene-culture coevolution (also known as dual inheritance theory), a larger and \nrapidly growing area that considers human genetic and cultural inheritance to be decidedly \ninterdependent.  A mathematical focus unites much of this research and the techniques of \n 8 \npopulation genetics are commonly used to model the dynamics of cultural transmission and \nthe interaction of biological and cultural evolutionary processes (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman \n1981; Boyd and Richerson 1985; Feldman and Laland 1996; Henrich and McElreath 2003; \nRicherson and Boyd 2005).  \n \nWe now lay out in turn the theoretical, methodological and sociological issues which \nhave distanced the three sub-disciplines, but in each section provide evidence that resolution \nmay be underway in each area. \n \n3. Theory \nHBE and EPSS have historically been at odds with one another (see, for example Symons \n1989; 1992; Daly and Wilson 1999; Smith et al. 2000), and CE has been somewhat \nmarginalised.  Below we briefly describe the theoretical arguments between HBE and EPSS.  \nWe then go on to explain why we take the view that, on the whole, there are no \ninsurmountable theoretical boundaries between EPSS and HBE.  Finally, we discuss the \nextent to which CE can also be integrated into a wider framework. \n \n3.1  The HBE\/EPSS Dispute \nThe core difference between HBE and EPSS has been captured by the distinction \nbetween fitness maximizers and adaptation executors (Tooby and Cosmides 1992).  HBE (the \nformer) assumes that behaviours are adapted to current ecologies, and EPSS (the latter) \nassumes current behaviours are the products of ancestrally selected psychological \nadaptations. EPSS has used this distinction to criticise HBE for being naively adaptationist, \nand providing no explicit method for distinguishing an adaptation (Symons 1989; 1992).  The \nHBE research programme assumes extreme phenotypic plasticity which EPSS characterises \n 9 \nas an emphasis on humans as unconstrained fitness maximizers and argues that this implicitly \nadvocates a domain-general cognitive system (Buss 1995). This directly contradicts EPSS\u2019s \ndefining assumption of domain-specificity.  In turn, the claim of EPSS that psychological \nmechanisms are adaptations to past environments has led to HBE criticism that EPSS puts a \nmisleading over-reliance on a simplistic hypothesis of our ancestral environment (Foley \n1995; Irons 1998; Potts 1998; Strassmann and Dunbar 1999).  Furthermore, it is claimed that \na consequence of this focus is that EPSS emphasises human universals at the expense of \nexploring the full behavioural repertoire of our species (Gray et al. 2003). \n \n3.2  Resolutions \nThe theoretical disagreements between HBE and EPSS have involved a considerable amount \nof misinterpretation.  It is not unusual to draw lines in the sand using extreme descriptions of \nalternative positions, especially in the early days of a discipline, but this hinders integration.  \nThese disagreements have centred on the following three issues: the role of adaptive fit to \ncurrent environments; with the domain-specificity or otherwise of the proximate \npsychological mechanisms; and, with the role of human universals versus variability. \nThe domain-specificity problem is easy to dismiss, as EPSS and HBE do not need to \ndisagree on this issue at all.  HBE is agnostic about the proximate mechanisms by which \ntraits are brought about, and therefore has nothing to say about whether psychological \nmechanisms are domain-specific or not (Smith et al. 2000).  Thus, the phenotypic gambit \nneither commits HBE to a domain-specific nor to a domain-general cognitive architecture: its \nfocus is exclusively upon the behavioural outcome.  As to specific notions of modularity, this \ndebate should be used to forward the field by generating research which aims to test \nhypotheses about the specific nature of psychological mechanisms (see Brown 2001; De \nWinter and Oxnard 2001; Menzel and Giurfa 2001 for examples from the non-human \n 10 \nliterature). Quarrels about the nature of cognitive architecture should certainly not be allowed \nhold up the integration of the field, since this is a question open to empirical testing.  \nTurning to the issue of universals versus variability, this is also perhaps not quite as \ndivisive as it might appear. EPSS, for example, is quite explicit that observed behaviour \nresults from the interaction of a universal human nature with environmental conditions, such \nthat behaviours are contingent, just as HBE assumes. Psychological mechanisms themselves \nare to be seen as conditional, or decision architectures, just as genes and other biological \nsystems are (Dickins and Dickins 2007). This can work in two ways: (1) we have an evolved \ncapacity to remember stimuli and make associations between them, for example, but the \nactual remembered material and associations made are a consequence of external factors and \ntheir salience in a given ecology; and, (2) psychological mechanisms are information \nprocessors designed to make judgements about best utility, which means that they embody \nstrategies for different contingencies. This latter notion is incorporated in psychological work \non future discounting (Daly and Wilson 2005) as well as work on more deliberative \njudgement and decision-making (Gigerenzer and Todd 1991). It would be a peculiar notion of \na psychological universal if it only allowed for one possible behavioural output. The disquiet \nabout claims to psychological universals, which arises from observations of behavioural \nvariation, amounts to no more than a grain-problem. The level granularity required to claim \nbehavioural variation is different from that used to claim psychological variation. \nPsychological mechanisms are discussed in terms of the type of thing they do, and behaviour \n(at least for HBE) is often focused on at the token level: so, there are mechanisms for \nmemory (for example, procedural memory for doing and making things) and there are the \nactual memories that different groups value (for example, how to make a canoe versus how to \nmake a dinghy).  Thus, EPSS can safely lay claim to the human universal of procedural \n 11 \nmemory, whilst HBE is right to focus on variability in the actual products.  Such a distinction \ncan be made across all of human activity. \nFinally, we need to deal with the issue of adaptation to past versus current \nenvironments. This is also not necessarily polarising, but it has produced the most heated \narguments between HBE and EPSS.   Clearly, many of the problems faced by our species, to \nwhich we might have evolved adaptations, have been around for a very long time, and the \npotential solutions are likely to have evolved sometime during our past. Additionally, there \nare some aspects of the modern industrialised world which are novel, and it is possible we \nmay be responding non-adaptively to them. Equally clearly, there is strong evidence that \nadaptations have continued to form in response to selection during the Holocene epoch (e.g. \nHill et al. 1991; Holden and Mace 1997; Williamson et al. 2007), including evidence for the \nevolution of genes mediating neural design (Evans et al. 2005; Mekel-Bobrov et al. 2005). It \nis also likely that even Pleistocene hunter-gatherer environments were considerably diverse, \nrather than presenting a set of static homogenised selective pressures, given the wide \ngeographical range hominins and early humans colonised (e.g. Dennell and Roebroeks 2005).  \nHBE of course does not deny that there were crucial selective environments in the past that \nshaped the underlying proximate mechanisms that in fact deliver behaviour; it is just that the \nphenotypic gambit renders theories of these environments inconsequential. Nor do they \nnaively assume that every trait is optimally adapted to its current environment (there is an \nimplicit recognition of this in the fact that HBE has largely restricted its analyses to \ntraditional societies). On the other hand, EP rarely operates according to a stringent \nPleistocene notion of the EEA (Daly and Wilson 1999), though some researchers within \nEPSS do (e.g. Symons 1992; Kanazawa 2004).  Most EP researchers look at modern \nbehaviours and try to hypothesise the adaptive utility of the current behaviour.  This is clearly \nevident, for example, in the mate-preference literature, which assumes that modern mating \n 12 \ndecisions are governed by universal dispositions that are effectively designed to maximize \nfitness (though exactly how such dispositions present themselves may vary according to \nenvironmental conditions).  The main points of attraction, such as symmetry, are argued to be \nindicative of developmental stability which is a current concern, as well as presumably one \nfor our Pleistocene ancestors and beyond.  It is only when non-adaptive behaviours present, \nthat hypotheses about ancestral environments aid the development of mismatch explanations.  \nSome evolutionary psychologists are also coming round to the idea that there may well be \ngenetic differences between populations that affect behaviour, as has been shown for a \nnumber of physiological traits (Nettle 2007).  This of course means there has been a diversity \nof selection environments.  \nSo we believe the theoretical differences between HBE and EPSS to have been \nsomewhat over-emphasised in earlier writings. However, we do not mean to suggest that all \ntheoretical differences are now resolved. Debates still remain, for example, on the extent to \nwhich particular behaviours are universal versus ecologically variable, or the extent to which \nbehaviours are adapted to current environments. But these debates are now being subjected to \nempirical testing (see, for example, Section 4.2 on the rise of cross-cultural work), rather than \nused as evidence of irreconcilable theoretical differences that hold up the synthesis of the \ndiscipline. \n \n3.3  The Cultural Evolution Position  \nDespite CE\u2019s relatively long history (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981; Lumsden and \nWilson 1981) it has largely been ignored by the EP and HBE literature (for example, in the 2-\nyear period before 2007 only 8% of articles in the main journal in the field, Evolution & \nHuman Behavior, considered culture as the topic point of interest: Hill 2007). The focus of \nEPSS on human universals means it has paid relatively little attention to cultural differences, \n 13 \nand where it does allow for cultural differences there is a tendency to assume they are \n\u2018evoked\u2019 (i.e. the result of context-dependent psychological mechanisms interacting with \nlocal environments) rather than \u2018transmitted\u2019 (i.e. the result of social learning: Tooby and \nCosmides 1992; Gangestad et al. 2006; Mameli 2007). HBE has tended to brush aside the \nissue of culture by assuming that cultural differences between populations are simply part of \nthe environment, rather than make cultural variation itself the focus of their investigations. As \npart of the phenotypic gambit it does not directly concern itself on the matter of whether \nbehaviour is brought about through purely genetic evolution, cultural evolution or gene-\nculture evolution, only the extent to which the end result fits adaptive predictions.   \nIts interest in current adaptiveness means that theoretically CE is more closely aligned \nwith HBE than EPSS. Much of the previous discussion on the differences between HBE and \nEPSS therefore also applies to differences between CE and EPSS. Given that CE is not yet a \nparticularly unified field, and that it is at an earlier stage of development than either HBE or \nEPSS, theoretical debates in CE often revolve around disputes within the field itself: for \nexample, the extent to which cultural evolution is inter-related with genetic evolution (Laland \nand Brown 2002); and debates around the importance of horizontal versus vertical \ntransmission of cultural traits between populations (Mace and Holden 2005; Borgerhoff \nMulder et al. 2006; Collard et al. 2006). Part of the reason for the marginalisation of CE \ndoes, however, hinge on theoretical differences of opinion on the importance of culture in \nexplaining human behaviour. Some within EP and HBE take the reductionist view that \ncultural practices simply result from individual behaviour, and therefore that the action of \nnatural selection will select for behaviours that operate in a group context. A separate study \nof cultural behaviour is therefore not really necessary: adaptations or adaptive behavioural \nvariability can be predicted without recourse to culture (Alvard 2003; Dickins 2005). There is \nalso some unease about the introduction of cultural evolution into the evolutionary \n 14 \nbehavioural sciences from at least some members of both the HBE and EP camps. Genetic \nevolution through natural selection is a long-established and (reasonably) well understood \nphenomenon, even if its application to human behaviour is relatively new. The evolution of \ncultural traits through mechanisms analogous to genetic evolution (though integrated with \ngenetic evolution) appears to some to be, firstly, stretching the analogy of Darwinian \nevolution too far; and secondly, uncomfortably close to the post-modern approach to human \nbehaviour, with its associated lack of scientific rigour (Alvard 2003).  \nBut overall, theoretical disagreements between CE and the other evolutionary \nbehavioural sciences (over and above those between HBE and EPSS) are relatively minor: \nboth HBE and EP largely admit that (transmitted) culture exists and matters at least to some \nextent to human behavioural evolution, even if the extent to which it matters, and the degree \nto which researchers think it necessary to include culture explicitly in their models, varies \nconsiderably. The marginalisation of CE by the other sub-disciplines may, in practice, have \nmore to do with methodological differences, to which we turn in Section 4. In summary, CE \ndoes not appear to have the programmatic aims of HBE, EP and especially EPSS. CE \nresearchers are individually engaged in specific investigations that would be happily \nincorporated within the broader human evolutionary behavioural sciences. CE represents no \nthreat to integration, but a fertile ground for cooperation. For example, Laland and Brown \n(2006) have suggested that the ability of our species to construct our own niches allows us to \nbuffer ourselves against adaptive lag, so that behaviour even in modern industrial \nenvironments may well be adaptive. This is relevant to HBE\/EP debates surrounding the EEA \nand notions of environmental mismatch.  \n \n4. Methodology \n 15 \n4.1.1 Methodological Differences \nWe now turn to more pragmatic reasons for the \u2018splitting\u2019 of the human evolutionary \nbehavioural sciences. Substantial methodological differences have exacerbated theoretical \ndivisions. Differences in preferred study populations, and methods of data collection and \nanalysis have hampered communication and potential pathways to synthesis. In terms of \nstudy population, HBE has so far almost exclusively focused on traditional populations, with \nhigh fertility and mortality rates (and therefore high variance in the traits HBE is most \ninterested in). In contrast, the vast majority of EPSS studies have been conducted on modern \nindustrialised populations. There is an inherent irony in this division: EPSS lays much \nemphasis on identifying universal preferences, yet focuses almost entirely on Westernised \npopulations, while HBE has assumed that its methods should be successful in any type of \nenvironment, yet have largely ignored the region in which most of them reside.  For example, \nalthough cross-cultural analysis was not entirely lacking from early EPSS work, it tended to \nbe relatively unconvincing at least to the anthropologically-trained HBE community.  Buss\u2019 \n(1989) highly cited work claiming to find consistent sex differences in mate preferences \nacross 37 cultures used no fewer than 24 samples from groups which were European or \nderived from European populations (e.g. US, Australia, South African whites). And those \nnon-Western populations which were included tended to be rather more \u2018Westernised\u2019 than \nthe small-scale traditional populations HBE has been interested in.  On the other hand, EPSS \nresearchers may well consider HBE\u2019s decision to ignore their preferred study population as \nan implicit recognition that their models hold little explanatory power when applied to the \nmodern industrialised world.  Therefore, these differences have traditionally left researchers \non either side of the debate unconvinced by the potential relevance of the sister research \nprogramme. \n 16 \nDifferences in methods of data collection and analysis are also apparent across the \nsub-disciplines. HBE researchers approach human behaviour from a background in animal \nbehavioural ecology or anthropology, both of which have long running traditions of \nfieldwork, collecting data from observed behavioural outcomes.  EPSS researchers, in \ncontrast, trained in psychological methods that use self-reported preferences or experimental \nmanipulations of behaviour, maintain that this is sufficient for distinguishing between \nalternative hypotheses about human psychology.  For HBE, observational methods enable \nperfect ecological validity; an assessment of variable phenotypic expression in its true \nselective environment. For EPSS, experimental methods offer high reliability in controlling \nfor independent variables that may otherwise confound results.  \nCE once again is best considered separately, since, initially at least, its methods \nfocused almost exclusively on theoretical modelling rather than empirical study. While this \napproach is undoubtedly important in the evolutionary tool-kit, it has its drawbacks. Of \nnecessity, strict assumptions need to be applied for reasonably simple models to be produced, \nwhich make it difficult for empiricists to relate such models to real world situations. \nSecondly, few researchers trained in empirical methods are also trained in mathematical \nmodelling.   While mathematical modelling is not entirely alien to other behavioural \nscientists, in order to clarify relationships in observed data, it is usually a minor component of \ntheir approach.  An over reliance on purely theoretical modelling by CE may distance it from \nempirical scientists. In addition, though it purports to be interested in the mechanisms of \nsocial transmission between individuals, CE research on exactly how individuals do transmit \ninformation to each other was traditionally lacking. Various mechanisms have been proposed \nto explain which individuals people choose to obtain social information from (for example, \nconformist bias \u2013 behave like the majority; prestige bias \u2013 behave like the most successful \nmembers of the community) but the theoretical modelling of such transmission biases is \n 17 \nrather more advanced than the study of how such social transmission works on the ground \n(e.g. Boyd and Richerson 1985; Henrich and Boyd 1998; Eriksson et al. this volume). This \nmethodological division between theoretical and empirical approaches is perhaps one of the \nprincipal reasons why CE has been somewhat sidelined in the human evolutionary \nbehavioural sciences.  \n \n4.2 Narrowing the methodological divide \nMovements to theoretical integration have been echoed by a softening of historical \nboundaries in methodology.  It is encouraging that, while HBE research is still biased towards \ntraditional populations, its theoretical framework is increasingly being applied to modern \nindustrialised societies.  One particular area of focus has been reproductive decision making.  \nIn part, this has been a direct response to early claims (e.g. Vining 1986) that adaptive models \nof human behaviour are clearly falsified by the emergence of negative or null relationships \nbetween wealth and fertility that characterise modernisation (Borgerhoff Mulder 1998). A \nsignificant body of research has now emerged encompassing both theoretical and \nmathematical modelling of the relationship between wealth and family size across multiple \ngenerations (Mace 1998; Hill and Reeve 2005; McNamara and Houston 2006) along with \ndirected empirical study (most notably Kaplan et al. 1995a; Kaplan et al. 1995b). Apparent \nmismatch between Western family size and the seemingly low ecological costs of child-\nrearing has led HBE to incorporate models from EP and CE.  For example, the work of \nKaplan and colleagues (1995a; 1995b; 2002) has a distinct integrative flavour, containing \nhypotheses about underlying psychological adaptations of fertility regulation that have \npredictive utility. While reviews of the evolutionary approach to demographic transition by \nprominent HBE researchers (Borgerhoff Mulder 1998; Mace 2007) have included integrative \ndiscussions of relevant studies in EP (e.g. Perrusse 1993) and CE (e.g. Newson et al. 2007).  \n 18 \nClearly this is a potential further stimulus to theoretical development and synthesis in its own \nright. \nPerhaps the methodological development most likely to promote integration is the \nincreasing inclusion of relatively non-Westernised societies in EP research. An active \nmovement to test models amongst a more representative set of human cultures is clearly \nunderway. Many EP researchers are now testing models in non-Western populations (e.g. \nBarrett and Behne 2005; Brown et al. 2005; Hagen and Barrett 2007), and others are \nattempting to reassess earlier demonstrations of universality with more diverse datasets (e.g. \nMoore and Cassidy 2007). Although including understudied traditional populations, such as \nhunter-gatherer groups, may be difficult in such large scale analyses, the potential \ncontributions are illuminating. For example, Moore and Cassidy (2007) have made efforts to \ninclude societies with relatively high degrees of female access to resources in a cross-cultural \nstudy of mating preferences. The study suggests that EPSS claims for universal sex \ndifferences in the prioritisation of wealth in potential mates requires reconsideration.  \nSimilarly, recent work by authors such as Furnham and Swami suggests that male preferences \nfor female phenotypic characteristics may be more diverse than implied in some EPSS \nresearch (Furnham et al. 2002; Swami et al. 2006; Tovee et al. 2006; Swami and Tovee \n2007).  In general it appears that a fuller discussion of the role of contingency in \npsychological mechanism and of cross-cultural differences in EP literature is emerging, \nthereby increasing its relevance to HBE and CE.  This development can only improve \nrelations between the sub-disciplines. \nThere are also notable developments in the CE literature as its researchers are \nincreasingly applying models to real data, at both the macro- and micro-evolutionary level. \nAt the macro level, researchers are beginning to use comparative methods to test adaptive \nhypotheses about cross-cultural variation in cultural traits (McElreath 2004; Henrich et al. \n 19 \n2005). In particular, the emerging field of cultural phylogenetics has had success in \nexplaining variation in traits such as lactose tolerance, sexual dimorphism in height and \nmarriage practices (Holden and Mace 1997; 1999; Mace and Holden 1999; Borgerhoff \nMulder et al. 2001; Fortunato et al. 2006). At the micro level, CE is slowly moving into the \nlab using both Western and non Western participants. Studies of social transmission in action \nare beginning to appear in the literature (Baum et al. 2004; McElreath et al. 2005; Mesoudi et \nal. 2006; Efferson et al. 2007), and a recent call has gone out to CE practitioners to \nincorporate the methods of social psychology into the discipline to gain a better \nunderstanding of cultural microevolution (Mesoudi 2007).    \nThe best demonstration of synthesis is collaborative research that genuinely integrates \nthe methods of each sub-discipline. A particularly fruitful line of enquiry is cross-cultural \nresearch and there has been a recent surge of such projects. Such work can get to the heart of \nremaining debates about the level at which traits may be universal or variable between \npopulations. A number of research projects have now been initiated with the aim of drawing \ntogether teams of researchers who pool expertise and study populations, in order to generate \nnew databases of comparative data. Henrich and colleagues (2005), for example, combined \nlaboratory EP with HBE field methods: participants from a range of small-scale traditional \nsocieties were given economic games to play, in order to explore and explain cross-cultural \nvariation in self-interest. A similar collaboration currently in progress is the Demography, \nEcology and Mate Choice project\n3\n, run by Penton-Voak and Josephson and funded by the \nLeverhulme Trust. Other projects, bringing together existing databases and researchers across \nsub-disciplines, include the intergenerational transmission of wealth in pre-modern societies \nproject at the Santa Fe Institute, organised by Bowles and Borgerhoff Mulder\n4\n.  \n                                               \n3\n http:\/\/www.demc.org \n4\n http:\/\/www.santafe.edu\/events\/workshops\/index.php\/Overview:_Inter-\ngenerational_Transmission_of_Wealth_in_Pre-modern_Societies. \n 20 \n Individual research articles are also beginning to use mixed methods, combining more \nthan one approach to the study of a particular question. For example, Newson et al. 2007 \ncombines lab testing of participants with cultural evolution models to examine how \nconversations with kin vs. non kin may influence reproductive decision making.  \nAnd both Jones et al (2007) and Waynforth (2007) have recently combined the traditional \npreoccupations of CE and EP by looking at the social transmission of mate preferences.  \nSuch collaborative ventures and the use of mixed methods raise the exciting prospect \nof gaining a much more detailed and complete understanding of human behaviour, by pooling \nthe expertise of numerous scholars from diverse fields of enquiry but all working within an \nevolutionary framework. \n \n5. Sociology \n5.1  Issues \nJust as it is important to identify methodological differences as a practical element in the \n\u2018splitting\u2019 of the discipline, we must also remember that theoretical debates do not occur in a \nsociological vacuum. Wilson\u2019s Sociobiology (1975) generated considerable controversy with \nneighbouring disciplines, not just the social sciences, but also biologists, many of whom were \nopposed to the application of evolutionary models to our own species\u2019 behaviour (e.g. Gould \nand Lewontin 1979; Lewontin et al. 1984; Rose et al. 2000).  Internal debates within the \nhuman evolutionary behavioural sciences have always existed within a larger context of \nacademic hostility. One might speculate that aggressive debates with neighbouring \ndisciplines have exacerbated internal tensions, instilling a combative attitude to discussion.    \nStrains placed on the discipline by external hostility are magnified by departmental \nseparations between sub-disciplines.  EP is typically hosted within psychology departments, \nand HBE and CE within anthropology departments. The latter placements are somewhat \n 21 \nironic, as neither HBE nor CE has taken significant theoretical inspiration from traditional \nanthropological studies. However, this has resulted in closer collaboration between HBE and \nCE than between EP and either of these areas.  Several prominent HBE researchers have, \nperhaps as a consequence, moved into CE research areas (for example: Cronk 1999; Mace \nand Holden 2005; Borgerhoff Mulder et al. 2006).  Physical separation of researchers \nhampers communication, and this enforced division pushes the discipline further apart in \nother ways, resulting in researchers publishing in different journals and attending different \nconferences. It could be that this is driven by an understandable desire to persuade other \nfields of enquiry of the usefulness of evolutionary theory, but it also occurs for more \npragmatic reasons. For career advancement, evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists \nare required to build a reputation in their home disciplines.  This means that it is their direct \npeers who will be reviewing their grants, applications for tenure and promotion.  Necessarily \nthis focuses activities within the relevant sub-discipline at the expense of engaging with other \nevolutionary sub-disciplines.  \nDistinct sub-disciplinary jargon is another barrier to integration which results from the \ndifferent disciplinary backgrounds. For example, what HBE refers to as phenotypic plasticity, \nEPSS would term evoked culture. Phenotypic plasticity is an important component of \nbehavioural ecology, and there has been much recent work on the topic in the biological \nliterature (e.g. West-Eberhard 2003). However, \u2018plasticity\u2019 is not a word that seems to find \nfavour with EPSS where it is seen as too vague a term to be useful (Hagen 2005). Phenotypic \nplasticity is not simply a vague statement that phenotypes can vary, however, but a rigorous \nconcept: reaction norms can be predicted which stipulate exactly how a phenotype changes in \nresponse to environmental cues thereby demonstrating the conditional nature of phenotypic \nexpression (e.g. Allal et al. 2004). HBE has in turn found fault with the EPSS phrase \u2018evoked \nculture\u2019, arguing that culture should be used only to describe socially transmitted information, \n 22 \nsince there is much \u2018evoked culture\u2019 (i.e. adaptive behavioural variation in response to \nenvironmental conditions) in non-humans animals that is not usefully described as \u2018culture\u2019 \n(Alvard 2003). The term is not therefore useful, and may be unnecessarily confusing, when \napplied to our own species. The issues of terminology require resolution for if the sub-\ndisciplines do not understand one another\u2019s language, misunderstandings can easily arise. \nFinally, the new and controversial nature of the discipline has enforced a strong concern \nfor reputation. Researchers in the HBE and CE community have been particularly vocal about \nthese concerns (Smith et al. 2001; Laland and Brown 2002).   One major issue revolves \naround the relative dominance of EPSS in the popular media (Cassidy 2005; Cassidy 2006), \nwith its attendant simplifications and lack of peer-review (Downes 2001; Gray et al. 2003).  \nThis media interest may be partly due to the focus of EPSS on Westernised society and on the \nperennially popular topics of attractiveness and sexual strategies. Whatever the case, the \nunfortunate consequence of this current dynamic is that assumptions about the evolutionary \napproach to human behaviour are more frequently based on knowledge of EPSS rather than \nany alternative approach.  This often leads to a one-sided, and inaccurate view, of the human \nevolutionary behavioural sciences both by the public and other academic disciplines. \n \n5.2.1 Solutions \nWider sociological issues may remain troublesome for the integration of the discipline until \nuniversities form unified departments of human evolutionary behavioural science. There are, \nhowever, already encouraging signs that some institutions are recognising that old \ndisciplinary boundaries are out-dated, and combining evolutionarily-related departments and \nresearch groups in order to build more integrated units. Below we note a number of \ndepartments and research groups within the UK that contain representatives from more than \none sub-discipline, rather than sequestering each into its home department. We restrict this \n 23 \nsection to the UK, as it is the area with which we are most familiar, but we hope that similar \nintegration is occurring in other regions of the world: \no the Centre for Evolution and Behaviour within the School of Biology & Psychology \nat the University of Newcastle \no the Evolutionary Psychology and Behavioural Ecology Research Group within the \nSchool of Biological Sciences at the University of Liverpool \no the Centre for Culture and Evolutionary Psychology within the School of Social \nSciences at Brunel University \no University College London houses two research groups with much cross-fertilisation, \nwhose members are drawn largely from the Department of Anthropology and the \nInstitute of Archaeology, the Centre for the Evolution of Cultural Diversity and the \nHuman Evolutionary Ecology Group \n \nEven where institutions are not sufficiently enlightened to provide integrated \ndepartments, it is still possible to create \u2018virtual\u2019 communities of like-minded researchers. For \nexample, the Work in Progress group at the London School of Economics was the crucible \nfor this particular collaboration between EP and HBE.  \nWe have recently developed another forum which explicitly aims to promote an \nintegrative framework for future study: The European Human Behaviour and Evolution \nConferences\n5\n. Initiated in 2006, the EHBE conferences bring together researchers from all \nbranches of the human evolutionary behavioural sciences and are deliberately designed to \nencourage communication and dialogue between sub-disciplines. Sessions are serial allowing \ndelegates to attend all sessions and strenuous attempts are made to ensure a balanced \nprogramme, with representation from all main branches of the field. For example, the 2007 \n                                               \n5\n www.ehbes.com \n 24 \nconference devoted a day each to human behavioural ecology, evolutionary psychology and \ncultural evolution (though other branches, including evolutionary sociology, medicine and \narchaeology, were also represented, see Section 6). Papers presented at the 2007 conference \nhave formed this opening issue under the new editorial board of the Journal of Evolutionary \nPsychology, which aims to become a similarly inclusive medium, interpreting psychology in \nits broadest sense to include HBE and CE. \n \n6. Beyond HBE, EP and CE \nThough we have divided the field into three for the purposes of this paper, not all researchers \nin the human evolutionary behavioural sciences align themselves with these camps. As the \nnumber of researchers on the field grows, new sub-disciplines are beginning to spring up and \nother social scientists are becoming interested in applying evolutionary ideas to their own \ndiscipline. Prominent examples of new sub-disciplines include: \no Reproductive ecology is an expanding branch concerned with understanding human \nreproductive physiology in adaptive framework (see Ellison 2001 or 2003) \no Evolutionary medicine (see Nesse and Williams 1995 for the seminal work in this field)6. \no Evolutionary archaeology (O'Brien and Lyman 2002; Bird and O\u2019Connell 2006). \n \nProminent examples of the application of evolutionary theory to the social sciences outside of \nanthropology and psychology include: \no Economics: activities in this area include the Economic and Social Research Council-\nfunded Centre for Economic Learning and Social Evolution at University College \nLondon, established by Binmore. Publications in this field include: Frank et al. 1993; \nGintis 2000; Bowles and Gintis 2002; Binmore 2005; Gintis et al. 2006  \n                                               \n6see the Evolution and Medicine Network for more recent developments, \nhttp:\/\/www.evolutionandmedicine.org\/. \n 25 \no Sociology: activities include an Evolution and Sociology session at the European \nSociological Association\u2019s 2007 conference. Publications include: Freese et al. 2003; \nDavis and Were 2007 \no Demography: activities include the Evolutionary Biodemography working group at the \nMax Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock; evolutionary demography \nsessions are now held at the annual conferences of the British Society for Population \nStudies, the Population Association of America, the European Association for Population \nStudies and the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population. Publications \ninclude: Murphy 1999; Lee 2003; Baudisch and Vaupel 2005; Hobcraft 2006 \n \nMainstream biologists may also be coming round to the idea that human behaviour can be \nstudied using the standard evolutionary principles applied to the study of non-human animal \nbehaviour, as evidenced by the joint School of Biology and Psychology at Newcastle \nUniversity; Lummaa\u2019s Human Life History Project in the Department of Animal and Plant \nSciences at Sheffield University; and the UK Association for the Study of Animal \nBehaviour\u2019s meeting on \u2018Sex, shopping and sharing: insights from animals to humans and \nback again\u2019 in September 2007. Indeed, a truly integrated discipline would involve the \nsynthesis of not just those researchers working on human behaviour, but all researchers \nworking in the evolutionary behavioural sciences, whatever species they happen to study.   \n \n6.1 Applied work  \nThere could be no greater sign of the influence of evolutionary ideas in mainstream \nbiological, social and medical sciences than its use in applied research. There are a number of \nrecent publications by evolutionary researchers attempting to demonstrate the relevance of an \nevolutionary understanding of human behaviour to policy-making. The first examples include \n 26 \nedited volumes which comprise a range of practical applications of evolutionary theory \n(Somit and Peterson 2003; Crawford and Salmon 2004), or monographs on specific areas of \npolicy (Thornhill and Palmer 2000; Browne 2002). These largely theoretical publications had \nlimited success. The former appear to have been largely ignored by policy-makers (Google \nScholar states that both edited volumes have been cited merely twice since their publication). \nThe latter have been unsuccessful, and heavily criticised, because they lack an integrated \napproach to their subject (critiqued respectively by Smith et al. 2001; Sear 2005). But, the \nfact that they exist demonstrates a clear interest in engaging with applied research.  \n A more promising line of applied work is that which is grounded from the beginning \nin empirical and often integrative work. The following research, focussing on a specific \nproblem and testing it in the field, may prove to be more useful to policy-makers in the long \nrun: \no Curtis et al. (2004) have developed an evolutionarily informed measure of disgust \nsensitivity and have begun to apply this in studies of hygiene behaviour in the \ndeveloping world (see also Scott et al. 2007) \no A study on the effects of cues of being watched on honesty has already attracted \ninterest from both the commercial and public sector (Bateson et al. 2006) \no Gibson and Mace made use of life history theory to analyse the impact of a water \ndevelopment project on the demography of a rural Ethiopian population, which \nstimulated discussion of the implications of development programmes on health and \nwell-being (Gibson and Mace 2006; and see commentary: Berhane 2006) \no Several more examples of the application of evolutionary ideas to development were \nrecently presented at the session on \"Human Behavioral Ecology: Applications to \nInternational Development and Public Policy\" organised by the Evolutionary \nAnthropology Section of the American Anthropological Association at the 2005 AAA \n 27 \nannual conference (see: Leonetti et al. 2007; Shenk 2007; Tucker and Rende Taylor \n2007).  \n \n6. Conclusion: The Human Evolutionary Behavioural Sciences \nWe are optimistic that a synthesis of the human evolutionary behavioural sciences is not only \npossible, but underway. In recent years most sub-disciplines have taken significant steps \ntowards theoretical integration and have broadened methodological frameworks beyond \ntraditional boundaries. Moreover, integrated studies, while not ubiquitous, are a significant \nfeature of the contemporary literature. This is not to gloss over differences between \ntraditional sub-disciplines, as it must be remembered that each approach is effectively \nconcerned with asking different questions about the evolution of human behaviour \u2013 but here \nlies the strength of an integrated approach; by tackling issues from multiple perspectives a \ncomplete understanding can emerge.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe LSE Work in Progress group and the UCL Culture Club provided useful discussions on \nearlier drafts of this paper.
