In the\nfirst few shots of the film, the excessive visual magnification of nail clip-\npings, strands of hair, and flakes of skin effects a visual deception upon\nthe audience: the nails look like large crescent-shaped pieces of frosted\nglass, the hair like lengths of rubber piping, the shower of skin like a\nbeautiful snowfall. Initially unidentifiable, these gigantic bodily fragments\nfall in slow motion, hitting the ground with a thudding vibration as they\neventually settle on a luminous blue surface that fills the screen. The\nexquisite visual poise of the mise-en-sce`ne is underscored by Michael Ny-\nman\u2019s melancholic, minimalist music, which completes the seductive aes-\nthetic of tranquility and perfection governing the scene. As the magni-\nfication lessens, the human source of these falling objects is slowly revealed:\na chin is being shaved; a rather androgynous chest is being scrubbed;\nmuscular arms are being abraded. A male figure is shown vigorously and\npainfully discarding all these external bodily traces in a cubicle bathed in\ndeep blue light; he leaves the shower room and, with a gesture suggesting\nthe ease of daily habit, turns on the incinerator inside it to obliterate all\nevidence of his physical presence. This ritual cleansing then starts to look\nlike something else: the work of disguise. The man takes two medical\ninfusion bags from a refrigerator; he attaches one to his now hairless upper\nleg at the level usually reserved for a garter belt and injects a sample of\nthe blood from the other into a pocket in a false fingertip, which he\nI would like to thank the following people for their generous comments on earlier versions\nof this article: Lauren Berlant, Claudia Castan\u02dceda, Laura Doan, Sarah Franklin, Hilary Hinds,\nAmelia Jones, Maureen McNeil, Michael Nyman, Andrew Quick, Celia Roberts, and all the\nparticipants at the \u201cBiotechnology, Philosophy, and Sex\u201d conference in Ljubljana, Slovenia,\n2002; the \u201cMissing Links\/Cybercultures and Cyborgs\u201d conference in Odense, Denmark,\n2002; and the \u201cMedia and Cultural Studies\u201d seminar at the University of Sunderland, Eng-\nland, 2002.\n1852 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nadheres to the index finger of his right hand, using an eyebrow brush to\nsecure the edges. His routine complete, he drives to work at Gattaca, a\nspace exploration center.\nGattaca is a film about a genetically defective man, Vincent (Ethan\nHawke), who disguises himself as a genetically perfect one, Jerome (Jude\nLaw). Its opening scene rehearses a disorienting visual deceit that con-\ndenses the film\u2019s more general exploration of the artifice of masculine\nperfection in the age of genetic engineering. These hypermagnified shots\nof bodily fragments foreshadow the film\u2019s more general investigation of\nthe relationship between scientific and cinematic technologies. The sci-\nentific and cinematic gazes merge as microscopic magnification and ex-\ntreme close-up shots combine in this credit sequence to bring us close\nenough to these corporeal fragments to feel as if we could almost touch\nthem.1 Seeing the body so close up and yet misrecognizing it so profoundly\ninvites contemplation of the relationship between seeing and knowing,\nbetween observable corporeal surfaces and the identities beneath them.\nShould we trust the knowledge promised by visual technologies? To what\nextent can they deliver the truth of a person\u2019s identity? For if these close-\nup shots offer the promise of truth through the magnified and slowed-\ndown image, they do so, ultimately, only to undermine its certainty: more\nvision, in this film, often leads to less knowledge, to distortion, to mis-\nreading, and even to a reversal of perception.2 What appears under the\nmicroscopic cinematic gaze as a beautiful snow scene is transformed into\na shower of discarded dead skin by a slight shift in visual perspective. The\nslowing down of time combines with the magnification of objects to\ntransform bodily abjection into aesthetically pleasing abstraction. And as\nthe whole trajectory of the film demonstrates, visual evidence and genetic\nevidence are not seamless equivalents, nor are they reliably transparent;\nboth are open to manipulation and susceptible to the indeterminacies of\ninterpretation. Even where genetic engineering promises to make biology\ndefinitively predictive, image and identity cannot simply be read from\ntechnology; they must be achieved through it. In Gattaca, identity is not\na straightforward question of image or even of embodiment; rather, it is\ninformatic. Identity here is a question of convincing your audience that\n1 The touchability of the image here is reminiscent of what Laura Marks (2000) has\ncalled a \u201chaptic\u201d quality.\n2 The relationships among technology, surveillance, and knowledge are a familiar theme\nin science fiction, e.g., in Minority Report (2002). For cultural analyses of science fiction\nfilm more generally, see Kuhn 1990, 1999; Penley et al. 1991; Sobchack 1997; Telotte 1999;\nWood 2002.\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1853\nthe genetic screening technologies designed to return the sign of the body\nto transparency make human interpretation unnecessary.\nSet in the not-too-distant future, Gattaca is a dystopian science fiction\nthriller offering a fantasy of a rigidly hierarchical society in which genetic\nscreening and selection brutally govern the fate of individuals. People\u2019s\nDNA can be tested from envelopes they have licked, hands they have\nshaken, mouths they have kissed, eyelashes they have shed. For a fee,\nanyone can use a strand of hair to have a potential sexual partner sequenced\nin a matter of minutes, to match for genetic compatibility. This is a world\nin which the blood test has replaced the police interrogation and the urine\ntest has replaced the job interview. The inequalities that result from these\ngenetic selections are presented most sharply in the space agency, Gattaca.\nHere, valids (those selected from genetically superior embryos) occupy\nthe high-status positions and are valued for their exceptional intellectual\nand physical attributes, while those not preselected, the in-valids, a term\nwith obvious connotations of physical inferiority, constitute the team of\ncleaners that services the building and its employees. Gattaca presents the\nnightmare of a new form of segregated workforce whose classification\nseems to have made perversely irrelevant the traditional antidemocratic\nhierarchies of race, class, and gender: in this world of genetic normativity,\neven white middle-class men like Vincent can be destined for repetitive,\nmenial labor.3 Motivated by sibling rivalry, however, he proves his brother,\nhis father, and the scientists wrong (but his mother right), defying the\nlimits of his genetically predicted future by becoming a space navigator\nat Gattaca. The means to this rebellious end is the adoption of the genetic\nidentity of a valid\u2014Jerome Eugene Morrow\u2014an Olympic-standard swim-\nmer whose genetic code is practically perfect but whose accident abroad\nhas left him wheelchair bound.\nThe quest for genetic perfection that governs Gattaca\u2019s dystopian fan-\ntasy is articulated through the film\u2019s fascination with visual perfection (see\nfig. 1). As David Kirby has written, \u201cVisually GATTACA conveys an an-\ntiseptic world that has been purged of imperfections. . . . [The sets] show\na sterile and blemish-free world filled with smooth stainless steel surfaces\u201d\n(Kirby 2000, 204). The preoccupation with visual perfection within a\nworld of genetic normativity is centrally elaborated through Vincent\u2019s\ndisguise as Jerome. Vincent imitates visual perfection by impersonating\nJerome (whose embodiment of desirability is amplified by the casting of\n3 As Kaja Silverman (1991) has argued in relation to Blade Runner (1982), slavery\nseparated from race provides a fertile fantasy for the threat of replication in science fiction\nfilm.\n1854 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nFigure 1 The mise-en-sce`ne is governed by a genetic aesthetic of a particular visual per-\nfection (symmetry, order, repetition, balance), as exemplified here in Gattaca\u2019s gymnasium.\nCourtesy of the British Film Institute.

The opening scene shows Vincent\u2019s daily phys-\nical transformation into Jerome as a spectacle of identity production. And\nyet, in so doing, it displays for the cinema audience precisely the deceit\nthat genetic screening promises to eradicate. In order to imitate Jerome\u2019s\ngenetic perfection, Vincent changes both his outward appearance to ap-\nproximate Jerome\u2019s image and his \u201cinformatic code\u201d by substituting the\nbodily markers of Jerome\u2019s genetic information (blood, urine, skin, hair)\nfor his own. In this spectacle, the technologies of imitation are set against\nthe technologies of genetic testing. With Jerome\u2019s assistance, Vincent\nbecomes master of the image and master of deception. Artifice is their\ngreatest ally against genetic determinism.\nIf the veracity of visual evidence is destabilized in Gattaca, so too is\nthe veracity of the body as the guarantor of the apparent truths of gender,\ngenealogy, and kinship. In placing Vincent and Jerome\u2019s criminal decep-\ntion at the heart of the discrepancy between visual evidence and genetic\nevidence (between the image and information), the film arguably undoes\nthe singularity of masculine sovereignty and queers traditional forms of\nkinship as much as it does conventional forms of vision.4 Biogenetic in-\n4 For a discussion of alternative kinship modes within lesbian, gay, and queer communities,\nsee Weston 1991.\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1855\nheritance is displaced through the rejection of genetic normativity as the\naudience gradually becomes privy to the alternative bonds of relatedness\nand forms of intimacy between the two men. For the production of Vin-\ncent and Jerome\u2019s shared bodily substances requires the improvisation of\nan intermasculine kinship with a distinctly queer feel.5 In their reinvention\nof the blood tie as genetic impersonation, Vincent and Jerome unite\nagainst normative injustice in their new form of shared embodiment.6 Like\nthe male \u201ccouples\u201d in Rope (1948) and Swoon (1992), Vincent and Jerome\nare locked into a sometimes claustrophobic mutual dependence; their\ncombined ingenuity is required to execute their crime successfully. But\nunlike the couples in Rope and Swoon, Vincent and Jerome are tied to\neach other through a commitment to a new, shared fabricated persona\n(one gives his body, the other his dream), and thus their loyalty to each\nother is always also a loyalty to themselves. Their embodied deception\ndefies both the conventions of masculine singularity and the deterministic\nlaws of the new genetics through a reconceptualization of identity beyond\ntraditional definitions of genealogy, gender, and heterosexuality.7\nIn this sense, although Gattaca is not strictly a cloning film, such as\nMultiplicity (1996), Alien Resurrection (1997), and Star Wars II: Attack\nof the Clones (2002), it nevertheless shares a preoccupation with tech-\nnologies of duplication and a fascination with deviant forms of related-\nness.8 While rejecting the injustice of genetic determinism, the film nev-\nertheless stages a cinematic vision of cloning through the imitative\nreplication of masculine perfection. Vincent becomes Jerome\u2019s clone in-\nsofar as he successfully passes as genetically perfect at Gattaca. The play\nwith narrative tensions around passing (will Vincent be caught?) rehearses\nthe familiar generic concern of science fiction with the problem of the\nauthenticity of identity and the suspense around detection; it also, of\ncourse, rehearses a set of associations with the homosexual closet.9 In the\nface of their possible discovery, Vincent and Jerome\u2019s mutual loyalty and\ndevotion to their secret commitment are repeatedly tested and ultimately\nstrengthened. The intimate exchanges between the two men (of fluids,\n5 I am grateful to Lauren Berlant for suggesting the term improvisation here.\n6 For a recent analysis of the blood tie and kinship theory, see Franklin and McKinnon\n2001.\n7 I am indebted to the \u201cPostmodern Genealogies\u201d reading group at Lancaster University\nfor discussions about queer kinship and shared bodily substances.\n8 For an analysis of the queer cloning of Ripley in Alien Resurrection (1997), see Stacey\n2003.\n9 The suspense about who is authentic and who is artificial is endlessly rehearsed in\nscience fiction film, most famously perhaps in Blade Runner (1982).\n1856 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nof knowledge, of dreams, of identities) expose the limits of their individual\nautonomy and push to the surface the mutuality of their improvised em-\nbodiment. In cloning Jerome, the two men enter the terrain not only of\nqueer kinship but also of homoeroticism. Passing and cloning (with their\nobvious homosexual connotations) are only two dimensions of the queer\nimplications of the criminal intimacy of genetic deception in this film.\nIn this article, I focus on the ways in which these multiple queer im-\nprovisations are set in tension with the more traditional cinematic orga-\nnization of sexual difference. The combination of the display of the artifice\nof a masculine impersonation with the queering of kinship in a post-\ngenealogical age makes this film interesting for feminist analysis. For while\nVincent\u2019s disguise requires a consideration of the operations of sexual\ndifference in this spectacle of masculine artifice, the intimacy of his col-\nlaboration with Jerome as master of genetic disguise calls for queer theory\nto unravel the homoeroticism of impersonation and new loyalties of queer\nkinship. Taking Gattaca as my central text, I shall examine the problem\nof rendering masculinity an authentic, stable identity when it is produced\nas a jointly authored technological achievement of genetic disguise be-\ntween two male collaborators.10\nTheorizing the masquerade\nThe display of artifice in the cinema has been widely debated within\nfeminist film theory through the concept of masquerade.11 Within the\npsychoanalytic version of these debates, feminists have claimed that the\nmasquerade is not only closely connected to femininity but is also in-\nextricable from its cultural ascription within patriarchal representational\nsystems such as Hollywood cinema. According to such a model, mas-\nculinity can only be designated a place outside the performance of the\nmasquerade.12 Feminist film theorists, most notably Mary Ann Doane\n([1982] 1991a, [1988\u201389] 1991b), have reread psychoanalyst Joan Ri-\n10 There is now a vast literature that builds on the earlier work of Richard Dyer (1982)\nand Steve Neale (1983) on the construction of masculinity as spectacle. For more recent\nanalyses, see Cohan and Hark 1993; Kirkham and Thumim 1993; Tasker 1993; Lehman\n2001; Holmlund 2002.\n11 Claire Johnston (1975) first used the term masquerade to analyze the place of woman\nin film; for a detailed genealogy of the uses of the psychoanalytic term masquerade in film\ntheory during the 1970s and 1980s, see Fletcher 1988.\n12 In her famous 1929 essay, \u201cWomanliness as Masquerade,\u201d Joan Riviere discusses the\ncase of a female academic who exaggerated her femininity following successfulpublic-speaking\nengagements as a way to contradict her \u201ctheft\u201d of masculine authority ([1929] 1986).\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1857\nviere\u2019s original 1929 case to argue that theorizing \u201cfemininity as mas-\nquerade\u201d might provide a means to explain the constraints of the place\nof \u201cwoman as image\u201d within a sign system governed by the law of the\npaternal signifier. Riviere explored the idea that \u201cwomen who wish for\nmasculinity may put on a mask of womanliness to avert anxiety and the\nretribution feared from men\u201d (Riviere [1929] 1986, 35). Importantly,\nDoane argues, there is a \u201ccurious blend of activity and passivity in mas-\nquerade (Riviere\u2019s patient actively strives to produce herself as the passive\nimage of male attention)\u201d and there is a \u201ccorresponding blurring of the\nopposition between production and reception\u201d ([1988\u201389] 1991b, 39).\nFor Doane, the concept of the masquerade highlights a crucial contra-\ndiction \u201cinsofar as it attributes to the woman the distance, alienation and\ndivisiveness of self (which is constitutive of subjectivity in psychoanalysis)\nrather than the closeness and excessive presence which are the logical\noutcome of the psychoanalytic drama of sexualized linguistic difference\u201d\n([1988\u201389] 1991b, 37). Doane emphasizes here how central reading and\ninterpretation are to understanding both masquerade and femininity.\nThus, although the masquerade \u201cis also haunted by a masculine standard,\nmasculinity as measure is not internal to the concept itself. . . . Rather,\nin masquerade, masculinity is present as the context provoking the pa-\ntient\u2019s reaction-formation\u201d (Doane [1988\u201389] 1991b, 39). Masculinity\u2019s\nrelationship to masquerade is thus placed outside the concept itself and\ntakes form only in producing the reaction in the audience or the\nreadership.13\nIf duplicity through artifice has had such a strongly feminine set of\nconnotations within feminist film theory, how might we interpret the\nmasculine imitation of masculinity in a film such as Gattaca, in which two\nmale characters combine their ingenuity and their resources to produce\na deceptive image of genetic perfection?14 In the opening scene discussed\nabove, a spectacle of fetishistic bodily cleanliness and grooming, such\nattention to the detail of a man\u2019s bodily transformation establishes an\nimmediate association with femininity: that is, an identity achieved\nthrough the labor of producing a perfect body using whatever artifice is\navailable and bearing whatever pain is necessary. In this scene, a number\nof close-up shots of Vincent\u2019s body confirm these more general feminine\nconnotations: the smooth, hairless skin, the somewhat androgynous chest,\nthe positioning and attachment of the urine bag as if it were a garter belt,\n13 For a detailed discussion of masculinity and masquerade, see also Studlar 1996.\n14 For discussions of the display of the masculine body through imitation and disguise,\nsee Cohan 1992, 397, and Holmlund 1993.\n1858 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nthe delicate and expert use of the eyebrow brush. Moreover, there is a\ndeeper association here based on the troubling potential for disguise in\nan identity premised on artifice. For if the work of femininity is not only\nto produce an image but thereby to achieve an identity, the figure of the\nwoman can be cast as the site for endless suspicion. Taking its most treach-\nerous form in the figure of the femme fatale, the deployment of a physical\nimage to effect a disguise is a move associated with the deceit of femininity.\nIn this scene, the scrupulous shedding of hair and skin to produce a\nsmooth, less legible surface and the meticulous attachment of blood and\nurine from refrigerated infusion bags all imply that the end product of\nthis ritual is some kind of deception.\nVincent\u2019s impersonation of Jerome is potentially feminizing not only\nas a prosthetic spectacle but also in its clear intention as criminal disguise.\nAs Doane points out, Riviere repeatedly associates the masquerade with\ntheft and \u201cstolen goods,\u201d since womanliness as masquerade covers the\ntheft of masculinity (Riviere [1929] 1986, 38). In Gattaca, Vincent is\nnot only associated with fraud, but, more significantly, his deception is\nnarratively tied in to a murder. The connection between Vincent and\ncriminality is elaborated in a number of ways: the sight of the murder of\none of Gattaca\u2019s directors coincides with the dissolve into an extended\nflashback in which Vincent\u2019s voice-over explains the history of his fraud-\nulent identity to the audience; as the murder investigation accelerates,\ndetectives (headed, unbeknownst to the audience, by Vincent\u2019s valid\nbrother, Anton) and their genetic screening devices threaten the continued\nsuccess of his disguise; moreover, his colleague and, later, lover, Irene\n(Uma Thurman), becomes suspicious that Vincent did in fact murder the\ndirector. The exploration of Vincent\u2019s deception thus becomes narratively\ninextricable from the investigation of the murder. Vincent is structurally\nplaced in the traditional position of the femme fatale\u2014through its disguise,\nhis body is potentially associated with treachery.\nIn imitating Jerome, Vincent has \u201cstolen\u201d a masculinity that is not his\nown. Does Vincent thereby somehow inhabit the traditionally feminine\nplace of the one who performs the image for the other? How is this\nspectacle gendered if it displays an imitation of a better masculinity? In\nher original essay, Doane wrote, \u201cThe masquerade, in flaunting femininity,\nholds it at a distance. Womanliness is a mask that can be worn or removed.\nThe masquerade\u2019s resistance to patriarchal positioning would therefore lie\nin its denial of the production of femininity as closeness, as presence-to-\nitself, as, precisely, imagistic. . . . To masquerade is to manufacture a lack\nin the form of a certain distance between oneself and one\u2019s image\u201d (Doane\n[1982] 1991a, 25\u201326). If, as Judith Butler has argued, \u201cRiviere\u2019s text\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1859\noffers a way to reconsider the question: What is masked by masquerade?\u201d\n(Butler 1990, 53), it is tempting to read the production of Vincent\u2019s\nimitative masculinity in Gattaca as the reverse of Doane\u2019s description:\nproducing a closeness to the image that masculinity usually lacks, closing\nthe gap between the self and the image usually reserved for femininity,\nor as the feminizing mask that sutures image and identity through genetic\ndisguise.15 But here the limits of the concept of masquerade become ap-\nparent: with their exclusively visual emphasis, theories of masquerade can-\nnot capture the dynamics of genetic disguise at stake in Gattaca. Passing\nthrough masquerade, Vincent perfects not only the image but also the\nlegibility of the code. Confirming the importance of Doane\u2019s emphasis\non interpretation in the case of femininity as masquerade and yet moving\nbeyond the image as the exclusive site of the production of identity, genetic\ndisguise here confounds the formulations of such theories. Vincent\u2019s im-\nitation of genetic perfection is not so much a feminizing masquerade as\nan imposture of informatics that turns inside out the meaning of identity.\nIf identity is now to be legible as a genetic code, new technologies of\ninterpretation open up possibilities of interference and intervention. Bio-\ngenetic mimesis becomes the new disavowal of authenticity.\nThis twist to the status of the image in Gattaca problematizes any\nstraightforward reading of Vincent\u2019s disguise as simply a feminizing mas-\nquerade. Throughout the film, the promise of the truth of visual evidence\nis subtly undermined even as it is reiterated: close-up shots of fragments\nof the human body refer back to the credit sequence, where the micro-\nscopic modes of spectatorship produce a striking proximity to the image\nbut do so ambiguously. In a world in which everyone\u2019s genetic code can\nbe technologically translated into a visual image (the genetic identification\ncard shows the person\u2019s name, DNA sequence, and photograph), the\nauthorities are so sure of the infallibility of their techniques of surveillance\nthat no one actually looks at photographs any more. As the broker who\nintroduces Vincent and Jerome says, \u201cWhen was the last time anybody\nlooked at a photograph?\u201d While surveillance technologies are intended\nfor social regulation, their ubiquity introduces new possibilities for dis-\nguise; as Hillel Schwartz writes: \u201cIn a world of proliferant degrees and\ndiplomas, impostors have more room than ever to move on from one\nhalf-life to the next. These days embossed papers substitute for person-\nhood, identification cards for identity, licences for learning\u201d (1996, 71).\nThe proliferation of information renders looking redundant. Turning their\ndomestic apartment into a stylish cloning laboratory, Vincent and Jerome\n15 For a discussion of \u201cfemale masculinity\u201d in film, see Halberstam 1998.\n1860 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nFigure 2 Vincent (Ethan Hawke) transforms himself into the new Jerome, the embodiment\nof genetic perfection.

Color version available as an\nonline enhancement.\nsucceed in an elaborate deception that plays the blind spots of the scientific\ngaze back to the corporate authorities at Gattaca, dodging the scrutiny\nof the scientific gaze by hiding in the shadows of its own occlusions.\nMasculinity as singularity\nThe instability of visual evidence in Gattaca can be read as an analogue\nto the film\u2019s exploration of masculine desire. On the one hand, it is Vin-\ncent\u2019s highly conventional masculine drive and ambition that propel the\nnarrative forward and his success that brings satisfactory narrative closure.\nAs the surveillance tightens, the new Jerome becomes tougher and more\ndetermined: as Jerome, he becomes invincible (not-Vincent; see fig. 2).\nHis potentially feminizing self-fabrication operates in the service of his\nmasculine desire for sovereignty and agency. And yet, on the other hand,\nthere is also a challenge to the stability of the all-seeing, all-knowing\nmasculine spectator position. For each time we might feel seduced by the\nfantasy of panoptic vision through our shared point of view with the\nprotagonist, our omnipotent delusions are thwarted, not only as Vincent\nhimself faces the next unexpected challenge but also as we are dislodged\nfrom the security of such an alignment. For example, the surprising dis-\ncovery that the detective in charge of the murder investigation is Vincent\u2019s\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1861\nyounger brother, Anton, reveals that our hero has been hiding something\neven from us. Moreover, although the film deploys typical Hollywood\ntechniques (such as flashback and voice-over) in order to position the\nspectator with Vincent, this is undermined by the lack of a sense of emo-\ntional depth to Vincent\u2019s interiority. Like the forms of its presentation,\nVincent\u2019s subjectivity remains a convention.\nSimilarly, although the narrative is structured around Vincent\u2019s desire\nto achieve heroic status and to prove the justice of meritocracy, the film\u2019s\nown awareness of this as a convention of masculinity confounds its\nstraightforward alignment with spectatorial pleasure. Vincent\u2019s desire for\nautonomous agency is presented precisely as his desire; it never fully be-\ncomes his identity. For as we shall see, Vincent never fully inhabits \u201cvalid\u201d\nmasculinity; he never fully becomes the author of his new identity as\nJerome. The film\u2019s repeated thwarting of Vincent\u2019s desire to author his\nown success is a narrative device to produce suspense, and yet it has the\ncumulative effect of questioning the foundational drive behind it. Gattaca\nexplores Vincent\u2019s masculine drive and, in placing him outside the dom-\ninant eugenic values of his society, invites us to invest in the success of\nhis deception, and yet in denying him agency in his final achievement,\nultimately leaves Vincent\u2019s desire for autonomy as a fantasy position. This\nworks in conjunction with the way the film places him (along with Gattaca\nand its eugenic project) at one remove from the critical spectator position\nit establishes. For Vincent wants to be accepted by the very institution\nwhose values his story has taught us to mistrust and abhor, and thus our\nposition in relation to his success remains partially skeptical. Like the\nbreathtaking scale of the monumentalist architecture or the impressive\nsymmetry of the chrome interiors, Vincent\u2019s ambition belongs to a mas-\nculine order that the film renders politically dubious, based as it is on an\nillusory fantasy of control, predictability, and order. The film presents this\nfantasy of masculinity through a series of reiterative performances, and in\nso doing it both animates masculine desire for omnipotence and disavows\nthe credibility of these performances by locating them firmly within a\neugenic aesthetic associated with dangerous delusions of totalitarianism\nand fascism.\nThe modes of disjunctive temporality that operate in the film further\nmark the gap between Vincent\u2019s desire and that of the spectator. For\nGattaca is an all-too-familiar version of the future. Using cliche\u00b4d fantasies\nof technoscientific endeavor from the \u201cnot-too-distant past\u201d (such as\nrocket science and space travel), Gattaca presents the masculine desire\ngoverning the hierarchies of a genetically determinist world as an ironic\nreflection on the modernist vision of the earlier period in which they are\n1862 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nplaced: the flashback to Vincent\u2019s childhood offers sepia scenes of ste-\nreotypical 1950s family life, together with retro-style furniture, cars, and\nclothes; the use of space exploration as the mise-en-sce`ne of masculine\nambition plays with a now-outmoded notion of space travel as the \u201cfinal\nfrontier\u201d for the progress of mankind. The image of a rocket launching\ninto space (with which the film closes) to symbolize the final realization\nof Vincent\u2019s dream places the spectator in the paradoxical temporality of\nbeing transported back to the future.\nVincent\u2019s masculinity in Gattaca is thus the rehearsal of a desire rather\nthan the achievement of an identity. As Joan Copjec has pointed out,\naccording to Jacques Lacan \u201cno man can boast that he embodies this\nthing\u2014masculinity. All pretensions of masculinity are then sheer impos-\nture; just as every display of femininity is sheer masquerade\u201d (Copjec 1994,\n234). Vincent\u2019s genetic disguise makes him the impostor who exposes the\nmore general facade of \u201cauthentic\u201d masculinity. It is as much about the\nrepetition of the impossibility of masculinity (as the invincible, autono-\nmous agent of events, as the original and the originator of meaning) as\nit is about the securing of its authentic form: \u201cImpostures succeed because,\nnot in spite, of their fictitiousness. They take wing with congenial cultural\nfantasies\u201d (Schwartz 1996, 71). Vincent performs the pretense of mas-\nculinity, and his elaborate disguise is a cinematic enactment of the im-\npossibility of ever embodying its literal form. In short, Vincent is an\nimpostor whose disguise reveals him to be surrounded by impostors. For\nCopjec, Lacan\u2019s \u201cdesubstantialization of sex . . . has allowed us to per-\nceive the fraudulence at the heart of every claim to positive sexual identity\u201d\n(Copjec 1994, 234). Butler elaborates Lacan\u2019s position thus: \u201c[Lacan]\nposes the relation between the sexes in terms that reveal the speaking \u2018I\u2019\nas a masculinized effect of repression, one which postures as an autono-\nmous and self-grounding subject, but whose very coherence is called into\nquestion by the sexual relation that it excludes in the process of identity\nformation. . . . The masculine subject only appears to originate meaning\nand thereby to signify. His seemingly self-grounded autonomy attempts\nto conceal the repression which is both its ground and the perpetual\npossibility of its own ungrounding\u201d (Butler 1990, 44\u201345). In Gattaca,\nthe masculine subject appears to originate not only meaning but also life\nitself.16 The repression required for the fraudulence of identity to succeed\nis turned into a science. The maternal body, as Susan George has argued,\nis displaced by the genetic selection of embryos before they are implanted\n16 For a discussion of \u201clife itself\u201d in the context of the new genetics, see Franklin 2000,\n188\u2013227.\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1863\ninto the woman\u2019s body, rendering the mother marginal to reproduction\n(George 2001). Contrasting with the very physical scene of Vincent\u2019s\nbirth earlier in the film, which shows the sweat and pain of his mother\nin labor, Anton\u2019s genetic selection shows four embryos imaged on a com-\nputer screen. Vincent\u2019s parents must agree to the suggested selection of\nthe chosen one, the singular promise of embodied perfection. The ge-\nneticist (like the manager at the company who will later reject Vincent as\nan in-valid before the job interview begins) is black, suggesting the sep-\naration of eugenics from its racist past and cautioning against the new\nhierarchies beyond race that genetic normativity might produce. The dis-\nplay of the four embryos on the screen alongside the recitation of the\ngenetic information transforms reproduction from a scene of human risk\nand adventure into one of an exact predictable science and conception\ninto a disembodied virtual selection of a known entity. Reproduction\nhereby becomes a form of authorship, as the masculine subject becomes\nthe originator of meaning and paternity takes on the art of science.17\nThe promise of genetic screening is to give a scientific certainty to the\nfantasy of authorship and autonomy that governs conventional masculinity.\nThe film systematically presents but then undoes the foundations of such\na fantasy through its exposure of the illusions of the predictive certainty\nof genetic codes. One by one, each of the genetic predictions whose truths\nhave justified the structures of Gattaca\u2019s unjust society is undermined:\nthe genetically guaranteed peaceful director of Gattaca turns to murder\nto defend his galactic vision; the doctor at Gattaca has an in-valid son,\ndespite all the technological means at his disposal; genetically perfect Je-\nrome wins only the silver medal and consequently attempts suicide (leaving\nhim in a wheelchair); and valid Anton cannot match in-valid Vincent\u2019s\nintellectual ingenuity or physical determination. These masculine subjects\nbecome the \u201cimpostors\u201d against whom Vincent pits his willpower and his\nintelligence: Can he trick the director, can he become Jerome, can he beat\nAnton? In his fraudulent genetic identity, as the one who \u201cpostures as an\nautonomous and self-grounding subject\u201d and yet can never be one, Vin-\ncent repeatedly performs his masculinity in relation to a series of masculine\nothers who represent the threat of the \u201cperpetual possibility of [his] own\nungrounding\u201d (Butler 1990, 45). The substance of his masculinity is\ntested through a series of challenges to the \u201cmasculine impostors\u201d around\nVincent who stand for the supposed genetic perfection of the valid sign.\n17 Rosi Braidotti offers a critique of how fantasies of reproductive technologies in science\nfiction film have produced the reinvention of a paternity that allows the exclusion of women\nfrom reproduction; see Braidotti 2002, 222\u201363.\n1864 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nGenetic perfection is the scientific equivalent of masculine singularity.\nAs Marie-Luise Angerer (2000) has argued, from a Lacanian position the\nfraudulence of masculinity lies in its imagined singularity. The imposture\nof masculinity is the imagining of the self as singular, as \u201cthe one\u201d\u2014the\nonly one. In Gattaca, Vincent rehearses this fantasy. Can he become the\nauthor of his own desired identity? Can he prove he is \u201cthe one\u201d? But\nVincent\u2019s ambition to demonstrate the outstanding singularity of his mas-\nculinity, by pitting it against the superior claims of the valids, produces\ninstead a relational identity, proving perfection in singularity to be an\nillusion.\nImpostors and impersonators\nNowhere is the singularity of Vincent\u2019s heroic masculinity more clearly\nundone than in his collaboration with Jerome: it is not one but two men\nwho defy the laws of genetic determinism in Gattaca. Vincent\u2019s individual\nagency is dependent on a collaborative, relational masculinity, for this is\nnot a single imposture but a duplicity\u2014as this word suggests, this is a\ndouble vision. This twofold agency requires an investigation of Vincent\nnot only as an impostor but also as an impersonator. In thinking about\nthis distinction in relation to doubles (\u201cimposture, the compulsive as-\nsumption of invented lives, and impersonation, the concerted assumption\nof another\u2019s public identity\u201d [Schwartz 1996, 72]), Schwartz writes:\n\u201cDouble agency, implying a singleminded performance of two opposed\nroles with silent devotion to a cause, is the impersonator\u2019s stock in trade.\n. . . But impostors are unable to bear the burdens of double agency.\nImpersonation, not imposture, is at home with quiet deceit and may breed\nunderground. Both may be impeccably costumed, yet in the final dressing\ndown, impostors want attention and love, and we may betray them; im-\npersonators want our money, our secrets, our family, and they betray us\u201d\n(1996, 72\u201373). If the masculine impostor is the one who appears to have\nachieved the singularity of autonomy and self-grounding, then the mas-\nculine impersonator is the one who recognizes the paradox of the need\nfor an other in order to achieve this illusion. In queer debates, Butler has\nfamously drawn on Esther Newton\u2019s work on drag queens in the United\nStates to argue that \u201cthe structure of impersonation reveals one of the\nkey fabricating mechanisms through which the social construction of gen-\nder takes place\u201d (Butler 1990, 136\u201337).18 Claiming that \u201cdrag fully sub-\n18 In his work on Hollywood stars, Martin Shingler has pointed toward a theoretical\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1865\nverts the distinction between inner and outer psychic space and effectively\nmocks both the expressive model of gender and the notion of a true\ngender identity\u201d (1990, 137), Butler quotes Newton\u2019s account of drag\nas follows: \u201cAt its most complex [drag] is a double inversion that says\n\u2018appearance is an illusion.\u2019 Drag says . . . \u2018my \u201coutside\u201d appearance is\nfeminine, but my essence \u201cinside\u201d [the body] is masculine.\u2019 At the same\ntime it symbolizes the opposite inversion: \u2018my appearance \u201coutside\u201d [my\nbody, my gender] is masculine but my essence \u201cinside\u201d [myself] is fem-\ninine\u2019\u201d (Newton 1972, 103). For Butler, drag visibly stages the gaps\nbetween the anatomy of the performer, gender identity, and the gender\nbeing performed: \u201cIn imitating gender, drag implicitly reveals the imitative\nstructure of gender itself\u2014as well as its contingency\u201d (Butler 1990, 137;\nemphasis in original). Here repetition is crucial to thinking about the\nstructure of impersonation. In her discussion of the problems of \u201cwriting\nas a lesbian,\u201d Butler suggests that \u201cit is through the repeated play of this\nsexuality that the \u2018I\u2019 is insistently reconstituted as a lesbian \u2018I\u2019; paradox-\nically, it is precisely the repetition of that play that establishes as well the\ninstability of the very category that it constitutes\u201d (1991, 18; emphasis\nin original). To the extent that impersonation requires the repetition of\nduplicity, we might ask, Does it make visible the internal contradictions\nof identity that will lead to its ultimate failure?19 Extending feminist film\ntheory through queer notions of impersonation, we might ask, What is\nspecifically at stake when the \u201che\u201d is the site of repetition, of the ritualized\nreconstruction of masculine perfection on the screen? In his impersonation\nof Jerome, is Vincent caught in the same linguistic bind that will eventually\nensure his exposure, his failure?\nTo impersonate is \u201cto invest with personality or the bodily substance\nof a person.\u201d20 The addition of the supposedly unique attributes of \u201cper-\nsonality\u201d or of \u201cbodily substance\u201d to another suggests an artificiality that\nis the reverse of impersonation\u2019s authenticating intention (the desire to\npass as someone else). Impersonation thus makes a double move: it in-\nvolves the production of authenticity and of a copy. It both effects and\nundoes personhood. But how might we think about the cinematic fantasy\nof a double impersonation, in which two bodies combine to produce a\nmodel that might combine psychoanalytic theories of masquerade with Butler\u2019s rereading of\ngender impersonation through drag (Shingler 1995, 192).\n19 For Steve Cohan, Butler\u2019s insistence on gender as \u201cperformative\u2014that is, constituting\nthe identity it is purported to be\u201d (Butler 1990, 25)\u2014allows for the consideration of mas-\nculinity as masquerade in film, not as a mask but as a \u201cpersona\u201d (Cohan 1992, 398).\n20 Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary (Edinburgh: W & R Chambers, 1973).\n1866 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nrenewed version of genetic perfection? In impersonating Jerome, Vincent\ninvests himself with the bodily substance (the DNA sequence) and, by\nimplication, the personality of another. It is their combined labor that\nachieves a composite impersonation of masculine perfection: Jerome pro-\nduces his own bodily fragments and samples, and Vincent reembodies\nthem to produce the new Jerome.\nIf the masquerade functions as an imitation of a feminine identity that\nis already a mask, what kind of masculinity is achieved through the im-\npersonation of genetic perfection? The concept of impersonation captures\nthe new tension between image and identity invoked by genetic engi-\nneering, which produces both original and copy. The binarisms (original\nand copy, authenticity and artifice, self and other) of traditional identity\nformation become redundant as biological reproduction is replaced by\ngenetic selection and recognition is now based on DNA profiling. If im-\npersonation means to invest with the personality or the bodily substance\nof a person, is genetic perfection not thereby already an impersonation?\nThe new genetics invites us to intervene in the identities and futures of\nothers. In his impersonation of Jerome\u2019s supposedly unique genetic iden-\ntity, Vincent confounds the truth claims of the predictions of technosci-\nence and of the singularity of masculinity. His deception literalizes the\nquestion of the legibility of identity\u2014of the language of genetics and the\nlanguage of gender. The supposed transparency of genetic information is\nopened up to the politics of interpretation; the supposed authenticity of\nmasculinity is exposed as a set of techniques that has become a marketable\ncommodity. In the dynamic between Vincent and Jerome, masculinity\nshifts back and forth between them and becomes a transferable skill.\nWith the making of the new Jerome, there is a transfer of power and\nauthority between the in-valid Vincent and the previously valid but now\nimmobilized Jerome. The scenes of Vincent\u2019s early adult life show the\nimpossibility of his becoming the self-grounding subject of masculinity:\nhe is part of the anonymous workforce that polishes the shiny surfaces at\nGattaca in which \u201cthe chosen ones\u201d will see themselves reflected back as\nthe proper subjects they desire to be. But he cannot bear the repetitive\nwork of cleaning (work typically associated with women, black people,\nand the working classes but here designated across those divisions to a\nnew menial labor force of genetic imperfection) and attempts to build up\nhis own body in order to turn himself into a proper figure of masculine\nstrength. Eventually, he recognizes he cannot go it alone; he needs a\nborrowed ladder to climb up the genetic hierarchy to achieve masculine\nagency.\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1867\nFigure 3 Jerome (Jude Law) as the embodiment of failed masculine genetic perfection: the\nin-validated \u201cvalid.\u201d Courtesy of the British Film Institute. Color version available as an\nonline enhancement.\nJerome, on the other hand, enters the film as a valid who is marked\nthrough his disability as an in-valid. He first appears sitting in his wheel-\nchair, smoking and scrutinizing Vincent with his piercing blue eyes (see\nfig. 3). His wheelchair sits at the foot of the double helix\u2013shaped staircase,\nthe striking spiral design of which cruelly literalizes his exclusion from the\nsign of his previous superiority and emphasizes the irony of genetic per-\nfection in the face of immobility. Although his disability excludes him\nfrom valid masculinity, he struggles to retain the superior status suggested\nby his air of upper-class English affectation. But such condescension is\nundercut by signs of decline and decadence, indicative of a similar loss of\nsocial power and status. His disability marks the imposture of his previously\nvalid status (winning \u201conly\u201d a silver medal and then attempting, and\nfailing, to commit suicide); despite his DNA, he cannot be \u201cthe one.\u201d\nNothing guarantees the successful embodiment of perfection; its fragility\nis the only certainty. Jerome thus represents the desired masculinity of\ngenetic selection while simultaneously marking the fragility of its embod-\nied capacity.\nBut Jerome\u2019s masculinity is reauthorized in a later scene, appropriately\nenough through his impersonation of himself. Jerome leaves his wheel-\nchair and hauls himself up the double helix staircase to greet the detective,\n1868 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nAnton (distracting him from the technologies of impersonation on the\nfloor below).21 As he accomplishes this almost impossible feat of passing\nas his previously able-bodied self, dignity, self-respect, and masculine in-\ntegrity are restored to Jerome. Ironically, it is through impersonation that\nmasculinity is repeatedly deauthorized and reauthorized throughout the\nfilm; its varying degrees are articulated in the two men\u2019s identities in highly\nrelational terms.22\nQueering kinship\nThis complex relay of transferable identities brings with it a series of\nassociations of kin relatedness. Although this is a nonbiological relation-\nship in the traditional genealogical sense, it is nevertheless all about shared\nbiogenetic substances. Repeated close-up shots of bodily substances invoke\na sense of shared embodiment through a nongenealogical kinship bond.\nIf the blood tie has been Western culture\u2019s mark of genealogy through\nkinship, then Vincent and Jerome reinvent kinship through the use of the\nborrowed ladder. In this distinctly unconventional exchange of genetic\nmaterial through prosthetic embodiment, the permanent and enduring\nties of genealogy are replaced by a new relatedness.\nContrasting traditional notions of kinship ties as \u201cunalterable biogen-\netic connections [that] accounted for the permanence of this very special\nsort of social relation\u201d (1998, 58) with new forms of relatedness, or \u201cfictive\nkinship\u201d (1991, 105), Kath Weston explores the enduring loyalty and\ncommitment of queer kinship systems. In Gattaca, Vincent\u2019s adoption of\na new biogenetic identity occurs not only in the context of his rejection\nof his biological family but also, in the end, through a filial power struggle\nthat he wins: in all the loyalty tests, \u201cfictive kinship\u201d wins out over ge-\nnealogy. But perhaps improvised kinship is a better term for Vincent and\nJerome\u2019s relationship. As in all improvisations, this new form of kinship\nrelies both on experimentation and risk and on a mutual trust and a shared\nknowledge. While it is at first a pragmatic business deal in which the\nborrowed ladder is a commodity, the intimacy between the two characters\nsoon stretches beyond purely commercial necessity. Vincent and Jerome\u2019s\n21 This scene echoes Scottie\u2019s famous attempt to overcome his anxiety and climb the\nsteps of the church tower in Vertigo (1958). See Modleski 1988.\n22 The investment of Jerome with a masculinity so desirable that others want to become\nhim represents a recurrent dimension of Jude Law\u2019s star image; see, e.g., The Talented Mr.\nRipley (1999) and Straayer 2001. In both eXistenZ (1999) and Artificial Intelligence (2001),\nLaw is positioned as the object of desire; he embodies the ideals of masculine perfection,\nbut his relationship to artificiality places him at one remove from such an embodiment.\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1869\nimprovisation produces a commitment typically reserved only for kin or\nfor lovers: they share bodily substances; they willingly risk their lives for\neach other.\nThe improvised kinship tie between Vincent and Jerome is given sym-\nbolic permanence in the scene of Jerome\u2019s suicide. As Vincent is reborn\nin the closing scene, Jerome is released from life. As Weston argues, \u201cOnly\na biological process (death), as opposed to a social process (rejection,\nneglect), is supposed to be capable of sundering \u2018blood\u2019 ties. In this read-\ning death becomes the terminus that marks the forever in a relationship\u201d\n(1998, 78). With Jerome\u2019s death comes the confirmation of their per-\nmanent tie; in this romantic image of foreverness, the fantasy of a shared\nfuture is confirmed. When the two finally separate (Jerome commits su-\nicide, Vincent goes into space), Jerome gives Vincent a lock of his hair\u2014\nan ironically romantic gesture in the wake of their genetic impersonation.\nSo how might the forms of genetic impersonation and queer impro-\nvisations of kinship in Gattaca require us to extend our thinking about\nsexuality in the culture of the copy? As is so often the case in popular\nrepresentations of genetic engineering, the heterosexual\/homosexual dis-\ntinction is clearly under scrutiny here. Throughout the film, the anxiety\nabout detection is staged around what Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick has called\n\u201cthe relations of the closet\u2014the relations of the known and the unknown,\nthe explicit and the implicit\u201d (Sedgwick 1994, 3). Vincent and Jerome\u2019s\ndeception places them in a shared domestic space full of secrets, puts them\nat odds with society, and requires their utter loyalty to each other in the\nproject of passing; their mutual trust is paramount to the success of their\ncrime.23 The relations of the closet that govern the staging of their con-\nspiracy are reiterated in the homosexual connotations of the \u201cperfect\nmatch\u201d of Vincent and Jerome: the broker comments that \u201cyou two look\nso good together, I want to double my fee.\u201d The labor involved in the\ncrime of genetic deception produces a physical intimacy between them\nthat reinforces these associations. Vincent literally wears Jerome\u2019s body\non his own. Jerome\u2019s gift to Vincent before his eventual (successful) su-\nicide is to leave him samples of his bodily fluids\u2014\u201cenough for two life-\ntimes.\u201d Through what we might call the \u201cprosthetic intimacy\u201d of genetic\n23 Along with lesbian and gay \u201cpassing,\u201d there are other forms of passing that are ob-\nviously connoted here: the rejection of Vincent from education and employment in Gattaca\nis reminiscent of the exclusion of black people from nurseries, schools, and jobs in the United\nStates prior to the civil rights era. For a discussion of racial passing, see Young 1996 and\nAhmed 1999.\n1870 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nimpersonation, Vincent and Jerome share the most intricate knowledge\nof each other\u2019s bodies.\nEven more explicitly homosexual associations are articulated through\nJerome\u2019s persona as the upper-class British fading retrodandy and self-\npitying lush. He combines many of the qualities of what Richard Dyer\nidentifies as the \u201csad young man\u201d of 1950s and 1960s cinema: he is a\nfigure of pity who is often shown as melancholic, pathetic, and both \u201cir-\nredeemably sad and overwhelmingly desirable\u201d (Dyer 1993, 73). Squab-\nbling on the telephone with the hair dye supplier about whether they have\nsent him \u201csummer wheat\u201d instead of \u201choney dawn,\u201d he enacts the classic\nstereotype of the \u201cneurotic, hysterical, bitchy gay man\u201d (Dyer 1993, 84).\nTheir relationship also performs many of the cliche\u00b4s of a conventional\nheterosexual marriage: Vincent is the husband who goes out to work and\nis ambitious in the public sphere; Jerome stays at home and fusses over\ndomestic routines and cosmetics. He drinks more and more and begins\nto act like a frustrated and jealous housewife. Ultimately, the only meaning\nin Jerome\u2019s life is sharing Vincent\u2019s dream.\nThis homoerotic intimacy, however, is disrupted by a third (female)\nterm\u2014that of Irene. This configuration is typical of what Sedgwick iden-\ntifies as \u201ca cultural system in which male-male desire [has become] widely\nintelligible primarily by being routed through triangular relations involv-\ning a woman\u201d (Sedgwick 1994, 15). As the object of romantic interest\nfor Vincent, Irene poses a threat to the exclusivity of the male bond\nbetween Vincent and Jerome.24 And yet Irene also has an uncanny re-\nsemblance to Jerome: she shares his facial characteristics\u2014high cheek-\nbones, wide jawline, steel-blue eyes, neat nose\u2014and so mirrors Jerome\u2019s\nembodiment of white perfection. As such, Irene is placed as the feminine\ncounterpart or even the heterosexual equivalent of Jerome (see fig. 4).\nAlthough Vincent\u2019s relationship with Irene is in some senses a traditional\nheterosexual romance, it might also be read through what Sedgwick calls\nthe \u201cprojective fantasy\u201d of \u201cvicariated desire\u201d (1994, 156\u201357). The notion\nof \u201cchains of vicariation\u201d (1994, 159) points to the interplay between\nidentification and desire and between sameness and difference articulated\nin these triangular substitutions. Thus, we might ask, with Sedgwick,\n\u201cHow are we to know whose desire it is that is . . . figured? By whom\ncan it be figured?\u201d (1994, 157).\n24 The triangulated dynamics of \u201chomosocial desire,\u201d normally opposed to homosexual\ndesire, is the subject of Sedgwick\u2019s (1985) analysis of the \u201cdiscriminations and paradoxes\u201d\nof such an ascription. For a discussion of these triangular dynamics in the novel The Talented\nMr. Ripley (Highsmith [1955] 1992), see Straayer 2001, 116.\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1871\nFigure 4 Irene (Uma Thurman) as the uncanny heterosexual female equivalent of Jerome\n(Jude Law). Courtesy of the British Film Institute. Color version available as an online\nenhancement.\nThis problem is amplified in a film about genetic impersonation: as an\nimpersonation, Vincent is already a substitute for Jerome, and as a valid,\nJerome is already \u201cartificially\u201d genetically selected. These genetic imper-\nsonations figure multiple \u201cchains of vicariation\u201d that disrupt the singularity\nof gender and sexuality and the authenticity of their embodied forms.\nVicarious desire for an impersonation presents an endless series of sub-\nstitutions. Irene might be understood as a heterosexual object of desire,\nbut one whose role is inextricable from the intimacy between Vincent and\nJerome, an intimacy that is itself founded on a desire to become the other.\nIn this context we might ask, Is Irene a substitute love object for Jerome,\nor is Vincent? When Jerome is feeling jealous, is he wishing he were\nVincent or Irene? Is Vincent sexually appealing to Irene only in his im-\npersonation of Jerome? Following the logic of this relay of queer substi-\ntutions through to its conclusion, we might ask if Jerome desires himself\n(in desiring to be Vincent, who desires Irene, who is a substitute for\nJerome). Indeed, perhaps this leads to the most disturbing fantasy about\ncloning\u2014that we shall end up desiring ourselves.25\nGattaca presents a vision of the triumph of individual masculine desire\n25 Thanks to Amelia Jones for her insightful comments on our underlying fears about\ncloning.\n1872 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nthat is repeatedly undercut by the doubly destabilizing and denaturalizing\neffects of these queer kinship improvisations and genetic impersonations.\nThe substitutions that are facilitated by impersonation \u201cqueer\u201d the sin-\ngularity, intentionality, and directionality of desire. The scene in which\nJerome hauls himself up the staircase to impersonate himself perfectly\nillustrates this: \u201cI think she likes us,\u201d he says to Vincent, including himself\nas the plural object of desire for Irene. The composite fantasy of the new\nJerome is the product of a homoerotic collaboration that is an imperson-\nation of an impersonation: a vision of hypermasculine perfection as a\ncultural achievement in which genetic selection has already undermined\nthe naturalness of identity and produced an artificially enhanced version\nof that masculinity.\nIn the face of the undoing of masculine singularity by these prosthetic\nrelationalities and vicarious substitutions, the liberal humanism that has\nhaunted the whole film surfaces more fully in the penultimate scene as a\nvehicle for masculine heroism in the absence of its more foundational\nsecurities. The film presents us (perhaps somewhat ironically) with Gat-\ntaca\u2019s vision of humanity as the sign of resolution, harmony, and hope.\nAs Jerome prepares to commit suicide, Vincent\u2019s impersonation of him\nis revealed to have been no secret to Gattaca\u2019s doctor, who has tested his\nblood and urine since his first genetic \u201cinterview\u201d at the space station.\nAll the costly and devoted labor of scientifically precise disguise is rendered\npotentially redundant by one unconscious masculine gesture: \u201cFor future\nreference, right-handed men don\u2019t hold it with their left, it\u2019s just one of\nthose things,\u201d he tells Vincent. Replacing the image of Vincent\u2019s in-valid\nidentification card with Jerome\u2019s valid one, he confesses to Vincent about\nhis in-valid son, who would also like to work at Gattaca. The ultimate\nthreat to expose Vincent\u2019s elaborate impersonation comes from a father\nwith the power to prohibit, who decides not to because he wants a sign\nof hope for his own in-valid son. He is the good father who, unlike\nVincent\u2019s own, recognizes human potential in vulnerability and wishes to\nprotect the imperfection that is human nature. Against the eugenic values\nof Gattaca, the figure of the doctor at the space station is the skeptical\nscientist as a model of the humane gatekeeper; his humanity comes from\na compassion borne of proximity to genetic in-validity. As the film\u2019s tagline\nputs it: \u201cThere is no gene for the human spirit.\u201d Or, we might conclude,\nif there is, it is an in-valid one.\nIn contrast to the doctor\u2019s humanity, the space station\u2019s vision of a\n\u201cpanhuman\u201d future presented in the final scene in the rocket appears as\nartificial as its genetic engineering: the scene displays a markedly multi-\ncultural crew as reassurance against the potentially racist eugenics of ge-\nS I G N S Spring 2005 \u2759 1873\nnetic determinism. As the camera pans around the inside of the spaceship,\nshowing close-up shots of the different faces of the human race, a vision\nof multicultural diversity represents the new eugenic humanism of the\nfuture. Just as the image of a rocket launching into space as a symbol of\nVincent\u2019s masculine achievement is a playful reiteration of a modern cliche\u00b4\nof the gendering of technology, so the image of genetic technology pro-\nducing a diverse global humanism leaves the audience with a familiar, and\nrather unconvincing, fantasy of unity through racial diversity. This highly\nmodern version of \u201cpanhumanity\u201d is produced by technology (the vision\nof the blue planet from space in the 1960s) and yet also promises to offer\na resistance to technology (the potential evil of genetic determinism).26\nTo be included in this fantasy of panhumanity, Vincent has first to be\nexposed, for \u201cimposture is not imposture until its duplicity is laid bare,\nand when impostors persist, treading in their own footsteps, they are not\nderanged but faithful to a lifelong project that oscillates towards the spir-\nitual\u201d (Schwartz 1996, 71). If masculinity is sheer imposture, and Vincent\nrealizes his ambition in the very moment his duplicity is laid bare, then\nthe void left behind by such a disrobing might be filled by the promise\nof the power of the human spirit.\nCinematic fantasies of the new genetics push feminist film theory to-\nward queer reflections on the limits of its own means of reproducing itself.\nIf femininity as masquerade opened up the possibility of showing the\ncontradictions of the place of woman as image in a patriarchal sign system,\nrevealing in the end that there was, in fact, nothing behind the mask but\nanother mask, masculinity as impersonation points to the dangerous il-\nlusory aspirations of singularity and perfection that govern the drive for\nagency, self-grounding, and authorship on the other side of the axis. But\nthe display of the labor of artifice in the name of the genetic impersonation\nof masculine perfection troubles any easy attribution of gender, producing\ninstead an ambiguity that plays across the binary of sexual difference,\nqueering the previous categories of feminist film theory. For the hetero\/\nhomo distinction takes on a new significance in the culture of the copy,\ncomplicating the question of how we know \u201cwhose desire is being figured\u201d\n(Sedgwick 1994, 157). The reproduction of sameness through sexual\ndifference is no longer so straightforward when the means for assuring\nits continuity are new technologies of replication that trouble the authority\nof paternity, inheritance, and heterosexuality in the cultural imagination.\nVicarious sexual substitutions proliferate in the new cultures designed to\n26 For an analysis of the concept of \u201cpanhumanity\u201d in global culture, see Franklin, Lury,\nand Stacey 2000, 37\u201342.\n1874 \u2759 Jackie Stacey\nimitate nature. It seems we should trust neither the cinematic nor the\nscientific evidence before us that promises perfection or predictability. If\nthe artifice of the image (femininity as the presentation of the desire of\nthe other) moves into the territory of the new genetic imaginary, in which\ntechnologies of cell replication provide the basis for fantasies for copying\nthe self, then the battle over representation becomes, inevitably, a battle\nover reproduction in both its biological and cultural sense.\nDepartment of Sociology\nLancaster University\nReferences\nAhmed, Sara. 1999. \u201c\u2018She\u2019ll wake up one of these days and find she\u2019s turned into\na nigger\u2019: Passing through Hybridity.\u201d Theory, Culture, and Society 16(2):\n87\u2013106.\nAlien Resurrection. 1997.
