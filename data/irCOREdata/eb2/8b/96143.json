L\u00e9vi-Strauss does not, \nafter all, think that we need more number-crunching social scientists.   On the contrary, \nthe mistake, he says, is for social scientists to have borrowed quantitative methods  \n \n... which, even in mathematics itself, are [now] regarded as traditional and largely \noutmoded, [without realizing] that a new school of mathematics is coming into \nbeing and is indeed expanding enormously at the present time \u2013 a school of what \nmight almost be called qualitative mathematics, paradoxical as the term may \nseem, because a rigorous treatment no longer necessarily means recourse to \nmeasurement.  This new mathematics (which incidentally simply gives backing \nto, and expands on, earlier speculative thought) teaches us that the domain of \nnecessity is not necessarily the same as that of quantity (1954, p.585, emphasis \nadded). \n \nHe has in mind mathematicians such as Andr\u00e9 Weil (who wrote an appendix to the \nElementary structures) and early game theoretic writings.i  The approach embodied in \nwork of this kind \u2013 which L\u00e9vi-Strauss links to developments in structural linguistics \u2013 \npresages for him a mathematics (and a social science) focused on \u201csmall numbers\u201d, \nconcerned with illuminating the relations between elements found in sets\/structures rather \nthan with quantification, as such. (If this seems wishful thinking on the part of a \nstructuralist, by the way, note that one of the most influential approaches in contemporary \nphilosophy of mathematics is called ... \u201cstructuralism\u201d.ii)  \n \n*** \n \nOf course, L\u00e9vi-Strauss would be the first to say that a folk version of \u201cqualitative \nmathematics\u201d \u2013 that is, a folk philosophy of structure \u2013will be found in all human \nsocieties.   In the remainder of this article I want to reflect on the Chinese version of this.    \n \nChinese society is famously number-oriented, i.e. numbers and numerology are pervasive \naspects of many Chinese social\/cultural practices.   Indeed, about ten years ago I decided \nto conduct a research project on popular numerical culture in rural China and Taiwan for \nthe simple reason that my informants there seemed, so much of the time, to speak \namongst themselves in numbers (Stafford 2003, 2004, 2007, 2008, 2009).  They talked \nendlessly about the lottery, about the prices of goods (achieved through haggling), about \nthe examination results and class rankings of their children. They used numbers to \ndescribe and evaluate public events such as banquets and rituals: how many guests, \nsitting at how many tables, eating how many different types of food?   What quantity of \nofferings should be given to the gods, how many times should we bow before them, \nholding how many sticks of incense?  Their fortune-telling practices were also explicitly \nquantitative: a matter of literally \u201ccalculating fate\u201d (suan ming) and sometimes even \nmodifying it by conspiring to change the relevant numbers (e.g. altering a character in a \nchild\u2019s name so that the brushstroke count for the name as a whole would become more \nauspicious).    \n \nOf course, many if not most cultures have the idea that some numbers (such as \u201cunlucky \n13\u201d) carry a weight of meaning.  But in China the case can be made that all numbers are \nimportant\/meaningful.   I even conducted a pilot project, at one point, to test the \nhypothesis that people in China simply find numerical information intrinsically \ninteresting \u2013 and more specifically that if numerical information of any kind is placed in \ntheir cognitive environments they will spontaneously notice and recall it (Stafford 2008).   \nIn general, then, it struck me that the Chinese and Taiwanese people I met were keen \ncounters and quantifiers.   And I think they are interested in number\/quantity for its own \nsake.  It is even tempting to say that they take an accountant\u2019s view of life (which, from a \nWestern point of view, may sound a bit of a putdown), placing their faith in numbers \nrather than words.    \n \nHowever I\u2019d like to make three points about this \u2013 seemingly quantitative \u2013 outlook.  \n \nThe first is that numerological practices in China are embedded in a more general \nframework that could be called structuralist (again, in the L\u00e9vi-Straussian sense).  This \nframework seeks to explain patterns\/structures (such as the patterns of the universe, \nincluding cycles of time), and the relations between elements in these patterns\/structures, \nin largely qualitative terms.   Of course, numbers can help with this.  For example, \nChinese fengshui  (geomancy) has many numerological practices linked to it.   But as \nFeuchtwang notes, fengshui should be seen as a distillation of a general Chinese \n\u201ccalendrical and natural philosophy\u201d which  \n \n... assumes that the universe is in flux, in continuous change, but that there are \npatterns of change discernible to experts in fengshui.  By observing these patterns \nand by understanding the natural laws which they manifest, experts can diagnose \nthe prevalence of good and bad influences at any spot of the ground (Feuchtwang \n2002, p.4).   \n \nWe might say, then, that the Chinese interest in numbers and quantity emerges from an \ninterest in pattern and in the qualities of patterns, not the other way around.   It is \narguably more mathematical than arithmetical in spirit.   \n \nThe second point is that quantifications of the kind I observed in China and Taiwan (e.g. \nthose related to haggling, or embedded in folk accounting) are often imprecise, even \n\u201ccreative\u201d.  One might think that a number-oriented culture would produce agents skilled \nat arithmetic, and keen on accounting precision, even tending (as Weber might have it) \ntowards a rationalising\/bureaucratising world view.  But many of the people I met in rural \nChina and Taiwan (such as small traders) seemed, on the contrary, almost wilfully loose \nin their accounting practices.  They often seemed as interested in the qualitative meanings \nof numbers words (e.g. arriving at \u201cgood-sounding numbers\u201d when haggling over prices) \nas they were in doing proper sums.   To put this differently: they were as keen on the \npoetry as the prose of numbers. \n \nGiven that Chinese (and other East Asian) students tend to perform well at \narithmetic\/mathematics in international comparisons, the idea that they are uninterested in \nprecision may seem far-fetched.   Note, however, the argument by the cultural \npsychologist Richard Nisbett that enculturation into \u201cholistic\u201d Chinese thought tends to \nproduce agents who \u2013 results at maths notwithstanding \u2013 are broadly \u201cnon-logical\u201d by \ncomparison with Westerners (of course, this claim depends on a particular definition of \nlogical).  He suggests that the Chinese performance advantage in mathematics is best \nseen as a recent historical artefact  (Nisbett 2003, pp.188-190).  In any case, here I am \nsimply suggesting that the Chinese interest in numbers\/numerology should not \nautomatically be equated with an interest in developing a precise\/rationalistic view of the \nworld.  \n \nThe third point, which follows on from this, is that while in the Western folk view \nnumbers are typically associated with a kind of cold logicality \u2013 the point of numbers is \nthat they give us a means of saying exactly how things are, devoid of subjectivity and \nbias \u2013 in everyday usage in China and Taiwan they are often emotionally loaded, and \nfrequently tied to the intimate domain of kinship and family life.iii  \n \nIn recent publications I\u2019ve provided two illustrations of this.  First, I\u2019ve discussed the \ncase of Mrs Chen, a businesswoman from rural Taiwan, suggesting that Mrs Chen\u2019s \n\u201cnarrative of self\u201d is importantly constructed around numbers  (Stafford 2009).  More \nspecifically, her emotional relationships with the three most important men in her life \u2013 \nher father (a spirit medium, now deceased), her husband (currently also her business \npartner), and her son (a star pupil) \u2013 are significantly narrated via the medium of \nnumbers.  For instance, the sacrifices she and her husband have made to support her son\u2019s \neducation are numericised, as is his ongoing success in school and university (which is \ntaken as a kind of return gift from him), as well as his exceptional frugality while living \naway from home.   As I note: \n \n... although social scientists may think of numbers primarily as a way of \naggregating the (otherwise unmanageably diverse) experiences of individuals , for \nMrs Chen numbers are one way of differentiating  her story from everybody \nelse\u2019s.  Virtually all Taiwanese parents spend money educating their children, of \ncourse, but the amount she has spent is possibly more than anybody she knows, \nand her son\u2019s results have generally been as good as (and for the most part better \nthan) those of any other young person from South Bridge.  When Mr and Mrs \nChen organise an event at her father\u2019s altar [before his death her father was a \nprominent spirit medium, and the Chens continue to be responsible for organising \nritual events there], the numbers (of participants, of \u2018visiting dieties\u2019, of offerings, \nof cash contributions) are part of the story \u2013 making her religious practice \ndistinguishable, in quantity if not in quality, from that of her neighbours (Stafford \n2009, p.9).   \n \nA second illustration is seen in the case of Mr Zhang, a farmer in northeast China who is \nnotably anxious about the risks he and his loved ones face, not least because his own life \nhas been marked by tragedy (Stafford 2007).  In thinking\/worrying about what may \nhappen next, Mr Zhang draws on two Chinese cultural frameworks related to patterns of \nhuman experience.  The first, already outlined above, is numerological\/cosmological in \norientation.  By situating one\u2019s own life trajectory within the mathematical structure of \nthe universe, people like Mr Zhang (who is deeply interested in fortune-telling) can \n\u201ccalculate\u201d what is likely to happen and try to avoid disaster.   The second framework \nfocuses on patterns in interpersonal relationships, and more specifically on the processes \nof \u201cseparation\u201d and \u201creunion\u201d which frame both public rituals (including weddings, \nfunerals, and most of the rites for dealing with ancestors and gods) and private emotional \nexperience.     \n \nBoth of these cultural frameworks \u2013 the numerological one and the separation\/reunion \none \u2013 have a predictive power, and through them individuals can exercise some degree of \nagency vis-a-vis the future.  The \u201cseparation and reunion schema\u201d (as I call it) is \nobviously emotionally loaded, i.e. it is explicitly tied to feelings of attachment, separation \nand loss.   However, what I want to stress here is that the numerological framework is \nequally likely to be used to understand and\/or control matters of the heart.   For example, \nMr Zhang and his wife were made very anxious, during my fieldwork, by the fact that a \nnephew of theirs was not rushing to marry during a window of opportunity (a two-year \nperiod) which had been revealed through divination as the only time when he could \nsecure a happy marriage.   Numerology not only helps determine when a wedding should \ntake place, it also helps determine whether the personalities and life trajectories of the \nprospective spouses will really  \u201ccooperate\u201d in the required way.   But here there\u2019s a \nparadox.  Numerology-linked fortune telling is one way of trying to dampen down the \nanxiety that might otherwise overwhelm someone like Mr Zhang when he reflects on the \ncircumstances of his loved ones and himself.  And yet, as the example involving Mr \nZhang\u2019s nephew suggests, numerical practices can themselves induce anxiety:  making us \nalmost paranoid about what numbers and number sequences may foretell.  \n \n*** \n \nObviously, much more could be said about each of these three points, but here I end my \nbrief consideration of Chinese qualitative mathematics on the question of attention.  In \nwhat I take to be the Euro-American folk view, both number in particular and \nmathematical outlooks in general (the latter arguably misperceived as being primarily to \ndo with number\/arithmetic\/quantification) are taken as almost prototypically boring.   \nThis contrasts with the generally positive Chinese folk view of number and \nquantification, which on closer inspection is seen to relate to the wider \u201cqualitative \nmathematics\u201d of experience embodied in traditional practices such as fengshui.   As I\u2019ve \ntried to suggest, this Chinese folk mathematics, and the \u201cstructuralist\u201d numerology that \ngoes with it, emerges from an interest in pattern rather than an interest in quantity, as \nsuch; it is surprisingly creative, even artistic\/poetic, in its \u201caccounting\u201d for the world; and \nit is sometimes linked to, and even directly inspires, strong emotions.   For the ordinary \npeople I met in rural China and Taiwan, this makes numbers worth paying attention to.   \n \nFOOTNOTES \n \n                                                 \ni See Almeida (1990) for an overview and discussion of some of L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2019s \nmathematical influences. \nii For a useful overview which situates structuralism within the history of the philosophy \nof mathematics, see Shapiro 2000.   \niii Obviously, in any culture numbers can become emotionally-laden through their \nassociation with important things like falling house prices or the margin of victory in \nsporting events.   My sense, however, is that in the Chinese case the numbers themselves, \nas numbers, and as instigators of emotionally-laden outcomes, are more likely to be \nfocused on by individual agents.   \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAlmeida, M., 1990.
