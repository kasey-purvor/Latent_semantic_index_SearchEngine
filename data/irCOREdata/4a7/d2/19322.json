This results in cellular activation through\nSTAT1 and aids in the elimination of intramacrophage patho-\ngens. Deficiencies have been identified in 5 proteins in this axis:\nthe b1 subunit of the IL-12 and IL-23 receptor (IL-12R\/IL-23R),\nthe p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 (IL-12\/IL-23), chains 1 and\n2 of the IFN-g receptor (IFN-gR), and STAT1. These deficiencies\nare caused by mutations in autosomal genes and produce non-\nfunctional or partially functional proteins [4]. The biology of IL-\n12 and that of IL-23 are closely entwined with both cytokines\nsharing the same p40 subunit and their receptors sharing the\nsame b1 subunit [6, 7]. Since the 2 presently described deficien-\ncies in the IL-12\/IL-23 component result in a deficiency of both\nIL-12 and IL-23 signaling, these 2 cytokines must be considered\ntogether when studying affected individuals and will, therefore,\nbe referred to as \u201cIL-12\/IL-23.\u201d\nPatients and methods. To compare immunity against salmo-\nnellae with immunity against mycobacteria in humans, we re-\nviewed data on 135 patients from 34 countries with confirmed\nIL-12\/IL-23\u2013IFN-g\u2013axis deficiency whom we have previously in-\nvestigated and an additional 19 patients described in the medical\nliterature [4, 8]. This encompassed all patients worldwide known\nto us to have IL-12\/IL-23\u2013IFN-g\u2013axis deficiency at the time of\nwriting, and this process was therefore unselective.

Only a small minority (6%; 9\/154) of patients had\nbeen referred with a history of salmonella disease alone. After\nexclusion of other known immunodeficiencies\u2014including severe\ncombined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease,\nAIDS, Di George syndrome, and antibody (IgG, IgA, and IgM)\ndeficiencies\u2014patients were investigated for deficiency in both\ncomponents of the IL-12\/IL-23\u2013IFN-g axis. No patients were\nreceiving immunosuppressive therapy. We stratified patients ac-\ncording to IL-12\/IL-23\u2013IFN-g\u2013axis deficiency and determined\nwhich patients had had salmonella and mycobacterial disease\n(table 1). In the absence of a suitable control group, the number\nof patients with IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component deficiency and a history\nof each disease was compared with the number of patients with\nIFN-g\u2013component deficiency and the same disease. Odds ratios\n(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with\nEpi Info (version 6.04) by use of the exact method.\nResults. The median age of patients (or age at death) was\nsimilar in both the group with IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component defi-\nciency and the group with IFN-g\u2013component deficiency (9 years\n[range, 2\u201335 years] and 11 years [range, 1\u201362 years], respectively).\nSurprisingly, we observed that 31 (44%) of 71 patients with IL-\n12\/IL-23\u2013component deficiency had experienced invasive sal-\nmonella disease, compared with only 6 (7%) of 83 patients with\nIFN-g\u2013component deficiency. This difference is highly signifi-\ncant (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03\u20130.28; ). In contrast,Pp .0000004\nmore patients with IFN-g\u2013component deficiency (94%; 78\/83)\nhad had mycobacterial disease, compared with patients with IL-\n12\/IL-23\u2013component deficiency (77%; 55\/71) (OR, 4.55; 95%\nCI, 1.47\u201316.67; Pp .0061). All 9 patients with a history of sal-\nmonella disease alone had IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component deficiency.\nThese observations are striking and suggest that there are key\ndifferences in the immune mechanisms operating against sal-\nmonellae and mycobacteria. IL-12\/IL-23 appears to be important\nfor immunity against salmonella in humans and appears to op-\nerate through IFN-g\u2013independent, as well as IFN-g\u2013dependent,\nmechanisms.\nCulture-positive salmonella disease occurred in 37 (24%) of\n154 patients. Salmonella was typically isolated from extrain-\ntestinal sites, rather than from stool (for all except 1 patient),\nand disease was often severe, with the referring clinician di-\nagnosing sepsis in almost half of affected patients. Salmonella\ndisease was typically difficult to treat; patients often responded\npoorly to conventional antibiotic therapy. Recurrent disease was\ncommon, suggesting either inadequate courses of treatment or\na problem with secondary immunity against salmonella. All\nexcept 1 of the serovars isolated were nontyphoidal. The median\nage at the onset of the first salmonella infection among all 37\npatients was 3 years (3 years [range, 1\u201312 years] for patients\nwith IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component deficiency and 1.5 years [range,\n1\u20136 years] for patients with IFN-g\u2013component deficiency). There\nwas no significant difference in the sex ratio of those patients\nwith IL-12\/IL-23\u2013IFN-g\u2013axis deficiency with a history of sal-\nmonella disease ( ).P 1 .5\nDiscussion. The high prevalence of salmonella disease among\npatients with IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component, as opposed to IFN-g\u2013\ncomponent, deficiency suggests that the fundamental deficiency\nin these patients is not simply a deficit in IFN-g production.\nAlthough many of the actions of IL-12\/IL-23 are mediated\nthrough IFN-g, it has other biological functions, and the pres-\nent study should prompt further investigation into which of\nthese are important for immunity against salmonella in hu-\nmans. Of the many cytokines implicated in immunity against\nsalmonella, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2013a and granulocyte-\nmacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are partic-\nularly good candidates for mediating IFN-g\u2013independent ac-\nBRIEF REPORT \u2022 JID 2004:190 (15 November) \u2022 1757\ntions of IL-12\/IL-23, since both cytokines are produced by T\ncells and\/or NK cells in response to IL-12\/IL-23 and both ac-\ntivate macrophages [6, 7]. Animal models suggest a role for\nboth TNF-a [9] and GM-CSF [10] in immunity against sal-\nmonella. At present, there is no recognized human immuno-\ndeficiency of these cytokines or their receptors, although hu-\nmans treated with the anti\u2013TNF-a antibody, infliximab, do not\nappear to show increased susceptibility to salmonella [11]. GM-\nCSF has been used as an adjunctive therapy against infection\nin clinical trials, but a beneficial effect is, so far, unproven [12].\nAnother potential IFN-g\u2013independent action of IL-12\/IL-23 is\nits immunoregulatory role of promoting Th1 responses, which\nare critical for effective cell-mediated immunity [6, 7].\nMuch of our current knowledge of the biology of IL-12\/IL-\n23 comes from animal studies, which also show a role for IL-\n12\/IL-23 in immunity against a wide variety of infections, in-\ncluding those caused by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi\n[6]. In contrast, salmonellae and mycobacteria appear to be the\nonly pathogens to which humans with IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component\ndeficiency show increased susceptibility, emphasizing the im-\nportance of studying immunity against these diseases in hu-\nmans [13]. Although the present study points to the importance\nof IL-12\/IL-23, this cytokine does not appear to be essential\nfor immunity against salmonella in all patients: we found high\ntiters of antisalmonella antibodies as evidence of exposure to\nsalmonella in 4 of 18 patients with IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component\ndeficiency who did not have a history of salmonella disease [8].\nThis difference in susceptibility to salmonella among patients\nwith IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component deficiency requires further inves-\ntigation. Other patients who did not have a history of salmo-\nnella disease may not have been exposed to salmonella. We also\nfound high titers of antisalmonella antibodies in 10 of 12 pa-\ntients with IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component deficiency and a history of\nsalmonella disease [8], indicating that these patients can mount\nsatisfactory antibody responses to salmonella.\nIn conclusion, clinicians should consider the possibility of\nan underlying IL-12\/IL-23\u2013IFN-g\u2013axis deficiency in patients\nwith recurrent extraintestinal salmonella disease, as well as in\nthose with disseminated atypical mycobacterial disease. Such\ndeficiencies are probably underdiagnosed in patients with sal-\nmonella disease but are clinically significant, as infections often\nrequire extended treatment, and live bacterial vaccines must be\navoided. The clinical observation that severe salmonella disease\nis more likely in patients with IL-12\/IL-23\u2013component defi-\nciency than in patients with IFN-g\u2013component deficiency sug-\ngests that IL-12\/IL-23 is a key cytokine for immunity against\nsalmonella in humans and merits both further investigation\ninto possible IFN-g\u2013independent IL-12\/IL-23\u2013driven mecha-\nnisms of immunity and dissection of the contributory role of\nIL-12 and IL-23. It also suggests a possible role for recombinant\nIL-12\/IL-23 as immunotherapy for severe salmonella disease.\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank Alexandre Alca\u0131\u00a8s for help with analyzing results.\nReferences\n1.
