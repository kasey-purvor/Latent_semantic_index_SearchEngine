A broad scope is adopted from legislation to technology and\nfrom low waste to consuming waste. A generic material, energy and waste flow model is\ndeveloped and presented to show the material, energy and waste inputs and outputs for the\nmanufacturing system and the supporting facility and, importantly, how they can potentially\ninteract.

This financial impact comes from\nmaterial, energy and waste costs as well as from the punitive costs from lack of compliance.\nAnother way of expressing this is the growing interest in the three legs of the triple bottom line\n(3BL) concept of People, Planet and Profit, i.e. social equity, environmental quality, and\neconomic prosperity [1].\nManufacturing and service companies are experiencing a growing impact from the changes.\nEnergy prices have risen considerably in recent years and the forecasts suggests this trend\n* Corresponding author: Department of Manufacturing, Cranfield University, Building 50, Cranfield, Beds MK43\n0AL, UK. email: p.d.ball@cranfield.ac.uk\n2will continue as oil output reaches a peak and demand outstrips supply. Additionally\nmanufacturing is seeing pressures from material costs and scarcity. For example, steel price\nand consumption have doubled over the last 10 years [2], waste disposal costs are rising (UK\nlandfill tax will double by 2010\/11 [3]) and there are concerns over security of material\nsupplies [4]. Manufacturing companies are therefore being squeezed by both the cost of their\nmaterial and energy inputs as well as their waste outputs. Reducing the carbon impact, and\ncost, of manufacturing inputs and outputs is a priority and is likely to become increasingly\nimportant with the introduction of carbon trading systems such as the EU Emission Trading\nScheme (ETS). Further, according to DTI [5], buildings account for 50% of UK carbon\nemissions and the UK\u2019s 2008 budget [6] expressed the ambition for all new non-domestic\nbuildings to be zero carbon by 2019. Apart from legislation and that reducing material and\nenergy use being simply good economic sense, it is also responsible corporate practice.\nPiecemeal approaches will reduce carbon impact but it is only by adopting a holistic approach\nthat zero carbon manufacture could be achieved. There is a need to extend the general\nprinciple of remove, reduce, reuse and recycle that is applied materials and to apply it to\nenergy as well. For example, reducing energy use for heating could be achieved by better\nthermal efficiency, in the extreme the thermal efficiency and reuse of energy could be so high\nthat it could remove the need for boilers for facility heating. So by using more renewable\nenergy, increasing the efficiency of energy use and creating less waste the net carbon impact\nof a manufacturing facility can approach zero. When designing manufacturing systems there\nis huge potential to think more fundamentally about these areas and to engage staff and the\ncommunity.\nThere has been a dramatic growth in research on sustainable production [7] and the\nmanufacturing community is thinking about zero carbon but there are few if any integrated\ntool-sets for them to use. This paper explores the gap between available low carbon\napproaches and technologies and how they are linked together to form an integrated\napproach to zero carbon. The paper presents the concept of an integrated material, energy\nand waste flow model that charts the generic lifecycle of material, energy and waste flows in a\nmanufacturing facility. These flows can then be used as a way of integrating approaches and\ntechnologies together for adapting the existing facilities through to re-building. Whilst the\npaper will present how the material, energy and waste flow model can be applied, it is also\nconcerned with the challenges and thinking of the zero carbon journey as much as the\nprocess tool to support that journey.\n2 Embarking on journey to zero carbon\nIs zero carbon about reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuel use or reducing energy use?\nIs zero carbon about reducing landfill or reducing material use? Zero carbon manufacturing\nspans a plethora of issues ranging from material and energy inputs, to the efficiency of\nmanufacturing systems and facilities, to the waste output and supply chain movements. We\nview zero carbon manufacturing as being \u201ca sustainable approach to manufacturing, which\nhas zero net energy demand and zero material waste across the supply chain\u201d. As will be\nseen, zero carbon demands that an integrated, systems approach is taken.\nThe principle of sustainable manufacture is to meet the needs of the current generation\nwithout compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs [8].\n3Operational methods for the minimisation of energy use in manufacturing have been studied\n[e.g. 9]. Pre-dating sustainability research are the waste reduction principles embedded in the\nToyota Production System [10]. Additionally there has been a particular growth in literature on\nmanufacture for re-use [11]. Despite this, the literature is lacking in how these components of\nzero carbon manufacture can be brought together in an integrated way.\nThere are a number of levels at which this area could be considered. Firstly the design or\nmodification of the product can have a significant impact on the material and energy use both\nin manufacture and throughout the rest of the life cycle. Secondly there are the\nmanufacturing processes that are utilised across the value chain to fabricate and assemble\nthe product impacting on the beginning of life phase of a product. Additionally there is the\nfacility design or modification to consider and how the \u2018shed\u2019 that is wrapped around the\nmanufacturing facility contributes to the energy used in production.\nThere are many publications on product design and the life cycle view [e.g. 12, 13, 14, 15]. In\na small number of industries, aerospace and automotive sectors in particular, the design of\nsingle product is likely to have a very significant impact on the overall manufacturing system\ndesign and the supporting facility. In majority of other industries the manufacturing system, its\nprocesses, its supply chain and the supporting facilities evolve over time through progressive\niterative and very occasional major changes. Major facility and manufacturing system\nchanges can occur independently of product design activity. Any product design or\nmodification decision is likely to have an impact on the manufacturing system and facility but\ntypically this is cumulative effect over many years. Whilst it is possible to consider these\nindependently, this paper focuses on an integrated view of manufacturing systems and\nfacilities that is cognisant of the design influence. In particular, there areas for potential\ndevelopment of manufacturing systems and facilities to progress towards zero carbon\nmanufacturing that are not prompted by design activity.\nMetrics exist for measuring carbon impact and many companies are activity engaged in\nmeasuring their carbon use and instigating programmes to reduce the impact. But whilst\nmetrics exist a hurdle that must be overcome is that manufacturing system design and\nimprovement approaches are lagging current awareness and drivers in sustainable activities;\nManufacturing system design approaches [e.g. 16, 17, 18] pre-date the growth of sustainable\nmanufacturing thinking.\nManufacturing systems (industrial systems) design focuses on flow and efficiency with\nperformance metrics that include cost, quality and delivery. Importantly, the flow analysis\ntypically focuses on the forward product material flow and neglects other material flows and\nwaste streams. Significantly, energy use is typically not a metric that is employed in\nmanufacturing systems design. Facility design is typically considered independently of the\ndesign of the manufacturing system. In the case of new facilities a \u2018shed\u2019 is typically designed\naround the required manufacturing system footprint rather than as an integral resource to\ndraw on for energy input and to reuse excess energy. In the case of manufacturing system\nredesign, the facility fabric and systems are rarely modified or upgraded. With no integrated\nview, design challenges are viewed at a local level rather than in an enterprise context.\nImprovement approaches for existing systems, for example those based around Value\nStream Mapping, are similarly deficient. This misses important opportunities for innovative\nsolutions to achieve zero carbon manufacturing.\n4By examining manufacturing systems and their facility\/infrastructure together, we move away\nfrom focusing on the individual design and improvement tasks or manufacturing technology\ndeployment and move towards an integrated view of the various lifecycles of: Material, energy\nand waste flows, building lifecycle and manufacturing systems lifecycle. Thus the challenge\nfor manufacturing requires supporting thinking and tools that integrate such key flows.\n3 Research design\nThe work reported in this paper is part of a wider programme of research with the aim \u201cto\ndevelop an approach to guide the design of zero carbon manufacturing facilities\u201d. Specific\nobjectives of the research are to establish current thinking on technological solutions and how\nthey are integrated, establish the requirements of zero carbon manufacture and ascertain the\nviability of using material, energy and waste flow modelling as a basis for supporting zero\ncarbon manufacturing facility design or improvement. The particular research question\naddressed by the work reported here is:\nRQ. Can modelling material, energy and waste flows form the foundation for zero carbon\nmanufacturing facility design?\nThe field of zero carbon manufacturing is fragmented and as yet there are no unifying\ntheories, frameworks or models. The research approach is therefore exploratory and\ninductive using case work from which theory can be built and tested. The case methodology\nis appropriate given the loose nature of the research field [19].\nThe data collection approach must reflect the emerging and fragmented nature of the field.\nLiterature from peer reviewed sources is an obvious choice but the data collection needs to\nbe broad to capture emerging thinking from expert interviews (practitioner and academic),\ncompany visits and trade events. The data collection must treat technologies as a \u2018black box\u2019;\ncentral to this is what technologies are available and their inputs and outputs rather than their\nfunctional capabilities. The data collection feeds into the analysis phase that aims to link\napproaches, tools and technologies together rather than attempt to further advance individual\ntechnologies. The analysis is therefore carried out with a process mindset, aiming to bring\ntogether the silos to deliver an integrated process view of zero carbon manufacturing. It will\nbe seen later that process maps of a manufacturing enterprise documenting material, energy\nand waste flows were created. These were developed from considering the inputs and\noutputs of each process and how they could link together in a manufacturing business.\n4 Zero carbon manufacturing approaches\nThe term zero carbon manufacturing is used here to include the production system, the\nsupporting infrastructure (including offices and facilities) as well as the interface with the\nsupply chain and community. Whilst new design activities and facility location will have\nsignificant influence on these areas they are omitted in order to provide a foundation on which\nto base a discussion on the typical scope of influence of a manufacturing operation and the\nassociated design and improvement activities .\nThere is a huge range of potential solutions to help a manufacturer to approach zero carbon.\nWind turbines and solar PV panels are candidates that may immediately come to mind.\nThese technologies can be utilised but it is argued here that it is better to think in clusters of\n5\u201cknow how\u201d, combining the technologies with the approaches and linking them together.\nAlso, there is greater potential benefit in considering how energy is used rather than how\n\u2018clean\u2019 it is.\nThe available literature on zero carbon, green, sustainable and environmentally-friendly\nmanufacture is vast but its maturity is still forming. Additionally, it sits within discipline clusters\nrather than following the life cycle of the key influences on zero carbon manufacturing, namely\nmaterial, energy and waste. For example, the lifecycle principle of cradle to grave is well\nunderstood, however, the principle of cradle to cradle [20] has yet to gain wider acceptance\nand adoption. The cradle to cradle philosophy is based on separating key material flows so\nthat materials can constantly be reused rather than down-cycled and eventually lost in\nincineration or landfill as is the case for most materials now. The following discussion is\nbased on a combination of literature review and primary data collection through company\nvisits, events and academic and industry experts. Much is based around technology but the\nimportance is placed on how that technology (or clusters of \u201cknow how\u201d) are combined\nthrough a systems viewpoint.\nConventional renewable energy technologies are often the first to be examined when\nconsidering zero carbon approaches. Wind turbines, solar heat and solar PV have been well\npublicised. Initial suitability of these technologies can be quickly gained from wind and solar\nmaps. Solar PV is relatively costly currently but technological advances and economics\nmeans that large solar PV panels, including for retrofit, could be a viable option within 5 years.\nHydro and emerging tidal and wave technologies exist and, as with wind, can be utilised via\nthe national grid. Thinking of technologies in isolation limits the overall benefit. It is simply not\nenough to switch a fossil fuel source of energy to a renewable one. Energy sources are\nseparate to the efficiency of their use. For example, using ground source heat pumps to\nprovide low grade heat for under floor heating combines a renewable technology with efficient\nenergy utilisation. Renewable technologies such as wind turbines are not strictly part of a\nmanufacturing facility, however, are included due to the potential for direct net carbon\nreduction as well as their impact on the facility, e.g. intermittency.\nMoving from the source of energy to the use of energy, manufacturing processes are the\nnext area to consider. Manufacturing processes consume significant amounts of materials\nand energy and in turn create significant waste. Lean [21] techniques may be considered to\nbe sufficient here due to their focus on value adding activities and the removal of waste. The\nremoval of waste is compatible with the greening of manufacture and reduction in\nenvironmental impact [22]. Activities may range from reducing inventory and thereby reducing\npotential obsolescence, to replacing inefficient motors with more efficient ones. However,\nconsidering the manufacturing processes in isolation risks missing wider benefits. Taking\ncompressed air for example, up to 10% of the energy supplied to UK industry is used to\ncompress air and up to 80% of the energy used in compressing air could be re-used for low-\ngrade space heating or heating water [23]. Given that as little of 10% of the energy supplied\nto a compressor may be converted into useful energy [23] alternatives to compressed air\ncould be sought. Viewing the manufacturing processes as an integral element of a larger\nsystem is necessary to get such benefits. For this reason, the research does not consider the\ndetail of individual manufacturing processes. Treating individual processes as \u2018black boxes\u2019\nforces a systems view of the inputs and outputs of a process that is so rarely considered. For\nexample, reducing resource and energy consumption in a painting process is a commendable\nactivity, but reducing it to zero is unachievable. However, treating the subsequent waste\n6water and energy outputs from a paint plant as potential inputs elsewhere rather than simply\nas wastes to be managed offers potential overall savings.\nMoving beyond the manufacturing system, the supply chain must be considered both\nupstream and downstream. At an operational level, the transport of goods from the supplier\nto the facility and from the facility to the customer can be a significant source of carbon\nemission depending on the distance travelled and the mode of transport used. This is\npotentially a significant issue given the growth of outsourcing and especially off-shoring.\nAdditionally the type of packaging must be considered. At a more tactical level, studies show\nhow different companies collaborate with their suppliers. Major companies such as Boeing\nand Nissan use standards like ISO 14001 to set environmental targets across their supply\nchain. Although ISO 14001 has become a de facto framework for environment management\nsystems, it is not a panacea as it does not specify clear targets or guidelines. At a more\nstrategic level the overall supply chain configuration covering the choice of suppliers and the\ninteraction with them would be considered. Many authors have investigated the \u2018greening\u2019 of\nthe supply chain [e.g. 24, 25, 26] covering performance measurement through to the\ntreatment of \u2018waste\u2019 (reduction\/reduce, reuse, remanufacture, recycle and dispose).\nAdditionally, the well established Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model is being\nadapted to incorporate environmental management in the form of GreenSCOR [27].\nThere is increasing attention being paid to converting waste into energy. Interestingly, the\nfuel for this type of energy can be stored and does not have the problem of intermittency.\nBiomass includes energy crops as well as organic waste that can be used for energy\ngeneration purposes. Technologies include anaerobic digestion, gasification and pyrolysis.\nMoving from technologies to clusters of \u201cknow how\u201d leads to better overall solutions, such as\ntaking appropriate community waste as an input to energy generation, thus reducing the\nproblem of community waste and obtaining a low cost source of energy.\nThere are a number of technologies that are specific to construction of facilities that can\nhave a significant impact on material and energy use. These technologies could be used\nwhen there are significant modifications to a facility or a new facility is built. Utilising sunlight\nfor both energy generation as well as indirect light is a powerful approach, not just to reduce\nnet energy demands but high light levels have been shown to reduce absenteeism, increase\nproductivity, maintain health and increase attentiveness [28]. Additionally it is claimed that\nthe carrying cost of people (recruiting, employing and retaining) is a hundred times greater\nthan the carrying cost of the average building [20]. Ventilation typically requires energy but\npassive ventilation approaches exist as well as heat recovery from spent air. At a very basic\nlevel, the greater use of windows that can also be opened may be a more cost effective way\nat providing light and ventilation than electric lighting and forced ventilation and air\nconditioning. Rainwater collection from the facility roof can also be used as grey water for\nsanitation as well as for all other uses following treatment.\nEngaging with the community and developing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) [29] are\nnot zero carbon approaches per se, but the thinking and values within a company can be\nspread into the local community for overall benefit such as influencing recycling and\ncommuting behaviours. Ultimately the interaction between a manufacturer and the local\ncommunity could be considered at a very high level of systems thinking, where waste from\nthe community or heat from the manufacturer could be exchanged with one another.\n7This section has given a broad, high level view of a selection from the components that can\nmake up zero carbon or sustainable manufacturing systems in the widest form. The\ncomponents alone will give benefit but, as the next section demonstrates, the integration of\nthese components enables further benefits.\n5 Integrated view\nModelling is a technique that can capture the complexity and interactions of a system to\nenable it to be more easily understood. Modelling can range from simple static\ndocumentation of process sequences to powerful computer based discrete event simulation\napproaches that capture the time varying, stochastic nature of processes. The static\ndocumentation of processes can be carried out using various techniques including flowcharts,\ndata flow diagrams, GRAI grids and IDEF. Whilst each technique has its unique strengths,\nthey are all able to capture complexity of interactions of activities and can be used as a\ncatalyst for ideas and innovation.\nModelling is an appropriate technique therefore on which to take an integrated view of\nmanufacturing for the pursuit of zero carbon. It has the potential to capture diverse activities\nincluding production, community and energy from waste. Inter-linking these diverse activities\ncould be achieved by tracing the material, energy and waste flows associated with each\nactivity and identifying opportunities for the outputs of one activity to form the inputs of\nanother. It is accepted that the material inputs and outputs of production directly link to\nsupply chain activities but less obvious is whether production waste is a loss from the entire\nsystem or an input to another activity. The advantage of process modelling is that it moves\nthe focus from activity (which could be a low carbon technology) to the interaction of activities.\nValue Stream Mapping (VSM) [21] is an established and valued technique in manufacturing.\nVSM allows a manufacturer\u2019s material and information flows from customer demand through\nto suppliers to be represented pictorially to engage staff in examining their process holistically\nand in turn identifying waste. VSM has a number of key attributes, namely:\n\uf0b7 it allows simplification and focus in complex scenarios;\n\uf0b7 it views the entire flow not just individual conversion activities;\n\uf0b7 it moves away from resource utilisation focus;\n\uf0b7 it is readily used to engage staff in improvement activities;\n\uf0b7 it can lead to counter-intuitive findings but systems thinking makes it a rational choice,\ne.g. reducing inventory in a system improves performance.\nThe VSM concept has potential for use in zero carbon thinking but not in its current form.\nVSM is applied to the primary material flows of the value adding processes and although\nwaste in its many forms is documented, the lifecycle of material waste is incomplete.\nAdditionally it typically ignores the support processes and the energy flows. However, if the\nVSM concept and use was widened to include the full material, energy and waste flows the\nprocess modelling concept could be used in the same way as VSM is now used to engage\nstaff and focus on waste in its widest form. Thus flows would not only include the value\nadding processes but the support (facility) processes also. Like with VSM now, a wider view\nof process mapping could enable it to be used as a catalyst for ideas and innovation for zero\ncarbon manufacturing.\n8Modelling the flows for the manufacturing system and the facility holistically allows the\nmaterials, energy and waste output from one activity to be utilised by another. At a detailed\nlevel it could be used to question why heat from air conditioning (perhaps used to cool a\nserver room) is expelled into the atmosphere but independently more energy is used to heat\noffice space. On a larger scale, low grade heat could be captured from energy intensive\nmanufacturing processes for under floor heating and organic waste could be used for energy\ngeneration.\nIndustrial ecology seeks to optimise the life cycle of virgin materials through to ultimate\ndisposal in the pursuit of sustainable manufacture [30]. Here each process is dependent and\ninterrelated to the wider system and opportunities are sought to reuse and recycle materials\nwithin a system rather than allow them to leave as waste (noting that most \u2018recycling\u2019 today is\nactually \u2018down-cycling\u2019 as the resulting material is of inferior quality [20]). Examples range\nfrom the reuse of materials in precious metals supply chains through to product service\nsystems [31] in which the product is retained by the manufacturer to provide a service such as\nthe models operated by Xerox and Rolls-Royce plc. Life cycle management approaches are\nbeing developed for sustainable manufacturing [32] that examine the product from concept to\nre-use\/end of life, but these often focus on the life of the product rather than the\nmanufacturing facility. Such approaches can provide a vision and framework to proceed but\nmore detail is needed on the material and energy flows.\nThere are examples of work on modelling sustainable production. For example a case study\nof a bicycle manufacturer in China where water, energy and solvent pinch analysis [33] was\nused to examine energy flows in the painting and drying processes independently which then\nresulted in one process pre-heating the air intake for the others.\nWhilst industrial ecology takes a top down view of a system and VSM takes a bottom up view,\nthere is no single framework or process reference model that encompasses all the material,\nenergy and wastes flows from a manufacturing perspective. There are, however, many\nexamples of companies using the waste outputs of one process as an input to other\nprocesses:\n\uf0b7 Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK use treated waste water discharged from their painting\nprocess for their boilers and compressors and has separately invested in rainwater\nharvesting [34].\n\uf0b7 Conoco Phillips Immingham combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plant supplies heat and\nelectricty to oil refineries using natural and waste gas from the refineries, thereby\nreducing the fuel input and carbon output [35].\n\uf0b7 IBM in Switzerland have linked a data centre to a swimming pool [36]. The data centre\nwill produce up to 2,800MW in wasted heat per year. Instead of using even more\nenergy to dissipate the excess heat it is cooled using a connection to a swimming pool\n(or rather the swimming pool is heated using the data centre\u2019s waste heat). Whilst not\nmanufacturing or within the immediate physical perimeter of the premises, this\nexample shows how the energy output of one process is used effectively in the\ncommunity.\nThese are examples of companies taking a systems view of their process flows and\nrecovering and reusing waste and energy to reduce cost and environmental impact. These\nexamples represent snap shots of localised improvement activities. The same principles\ncould be achieved across a whole facility but there is a lack of guidance and reference\n9processes to assist manufacturing companies. The next section introduces generic material,\nenergy and waste flow modelling and demonstrates how it can be applied.\n6 Application of the material, energy and waste process flow concept\nIn this section the application of the material, energy and waste flow concept will be\npresented. The modelling approach will be described, and the generic flow model derived\nfrom primary case research is presented together with examples illustrating its operational\nviability.\nThe areas covered in the earlier review of zero carbon approaches and technologies are a\ncombination of core manufacturing activities and general technologies or mechanisms.\nAdditionally, emerging legislation is having a significant impact on this area. In creating flow\nmodels of this area, the IDEF0 format is well suited. Each activity in an IDEF0 model has\ninputs entering on the left, outputs leaving on the right, mechanisms feeding from below and\ncontrols or policies from above. This can be illustrated in Figure 1 which shows the potential\nfor modelling the material, energy and waste flows. Here a number of energy inputs are\nconverted into \u2018green\u2019 energy output using a number of mechanisms and a number of\ncontrols. Whilst it could be argued the generation of energy is outside the scope of\nmanufacturing activities, most of the outputs and many of the inputs shown in Figure 1 are\nsupplied from and delivered to manufacturing operations.\n10\nI3\nI11\nI1\nI2 O3\nI4\nI5\nI6\nI7\nI8\nI9 O1\nI10\nO2\nO4\nC5C1C2 C4C3\nM 1M2M3M4\nWind Energy\nA313\nSolar Energy\nA312\nCHP Plant\nA311\nWind\nSunlight\nCommunity Organic Waste\nFacility's Organic Waste\nManufacturing Consumable Packaging Wastes\nOffice Consumables Packaging Wastes\nOrganic Waste\nConsumable Wastes\nFood Packaging Wastes\nCommunity Municipal Waste\nOffice Consumables Wastes\nGreen Electricity\nHazardous Waste\nHot Water\nHeat\nFertiliser for agriculture\nHeat Loss\nCAA Regulations\nCosts\nRegulations\nLabour\nEnergy Conversion Efficiency\nPayback Period\nTechnology Readiness\nTechnology Suppliers\nContractors\nLocal Council\nGovernment Incentives\nFigure 1. The concept of modelling material, energy and waste flows applied to renewable\nenergy sources for facility\nFigure 2 shows how this concept can be extended wider for other utility supplies into the\nmanufacturing system. The figure shows how renewable energy sources (as well as grid\nelectricity) enter the system leave in a different form, e.g. \u2018green\u2019 electricity\u2019. Another flow to\nhighlight is grey water entering the system and being processed for use as cooling and\nheating water.\n11\nO5\nO4\nI10\nI6\nO3\nI8\nI11\nO1\nI7\nI9\nI1\nI5\nI4\nI3\nO2\nI2\nO6\nM2 M1\nC1\nSupporting Systems\nA32\nRenewable Energy Sources\nA31\nHot Air\nGrid Electricity\nGrey Water\nMains Water\nGround Source Heat\nRain\nSun Heat\nNatural Light\nDischarged Water\nCooling & Heating Water\nHVAC\nHeat\nFacility's Organic Waste\nCommunity Organic Waste\nHeat Loss\nSunlight\nHot Water\nCommunity Municipal Waste\nWind\nManufacturing Consumable Packaging Wastes\nOffice Consumables Packaging Wastes\nOrganic Waste\nConsumable Wastes\nFood Packaging Wastes\nOffice Consumables Wastes\nGreen Electricity\nFertiliser for agriculture\nMaintenance Cost\nThermal Comfort Requirements\nFenestration\nHVAC System\nGround Source Heat Pumps\nWater Reticulation System\nCosts\nTechnology Suppliers\nContractors\nLocal Council\nRegulations\nEnergy Conversion Efficiency\nPayback Period\nTechnology Readiness\nGovernment Incentives\nBuilding Design\nEnvironmental Policy\nFigure 2. Utility supply flow modelling\nThe approach is hierarchical. The activities A12 and A13 in Figure 2 are in turn decomposed\ninto more and more detail. So far it is only the utilities supply to the manufacturing system\nthat has been presented and not the manufacturing system itself. Figure 3 illustrates the\nwider application of the concept to the manufacturing system, workforce, community and\nutilities of a manufacturing enterprise. As before, each of these activities is in turn\ndecomposed into more detailed activities and flows. The flow model shows how inputs into\nutilities such as community waste are converted to outputs that become inputs to the\nmanufacturing system.\n12\nFigure 3. Top level view of the flows of a manufacturing enterprise.\nThe importance of the modelling approach is that it captures the complexity of manufacturing\nsystems material and energy flows. It can then trigger discussion of how input requirements\nof one activity can be provided by the output of another activity previously considered\nindependently, e.g. office heating could be provided by excess manufacturing process heat.\nThe controls include legislation and policies. Mechanisms would cover the emerging\nsolutions explained next.\nSuch maps capture the complexity but it is not suggested they be used in their entirety.\nWhen examining a particular flow or area of improvement the relevant flows would be\nidentified and the others discarded. For communication to others, the IDEF0 format could\neither be maintained or the simplified and represented pictorially. For example, Figure 4\nshows the main water flows in a facility. Manufacturing process water flows could be added\nas appropriate between the membrane bio-reactor and the waste water treatment. The\ndiagram shows how rainwater harvesting from the facility roof is stored, treated, used and\nthen treated for reuse or release into the public sewer. Deliberately, mains water input has\nnot been shown; this diagram is an instance of the IDEF0 flow model from analysis for a UK\ncompany to show that it could supply all its water requirements from harvesting and storing\nless than 25% of the typical rainwater falling on the roof. This diagram shows how technology\nand \u2018know how\u2019 can be integrated together in a systems view. Each of these activities can\nthen be costed and compared with current and variant installations.\n13\nFigure 4. Rainwater collection for grey and clean water use.\nA second example of selecting flows is for the light and heat required for manufacturing\noperations, illustrated in Figure 5. Again, this is a pictorial representation for a case company\ntaken from the generic flow model shown in Figure 3. Here the material flow is from left to\nright across the lower part of the diagram and the lighting flows from the use of electricity and\nsolar are shown at the top of the diagram. The particular production process uses a heat\ntreatment operation from which waste heat is captured and transferred for facility heat rather\nthan expelled to the atmosphere. Additionally there is a Combined Heat and Power (CHP)\nbiomass plant that generates heat and electricity for the facility. Whilst this is very much a\nsimplified view, it shows that there is material waste leaving the process that can prompt how\nthis could be reduced or reused. For example, using incoming packaging waste or production\nwaste for the CHP feed. Whilst the supply chain is not represented in the diagram, the\nembedded carbon in raw materials could be. It would be different for local and global supply\nand this would impact on the embedded carbon in the finished product. Overall the diagram\ncould be criticised as insufficient representation of the actual system with inputs or outputs\nmissing or under-utilised. However, if such questions arise then the approach serves part of\nits purpose, namely to trigger discussion and act as a catalyst for ideas.\n14\nGas\nRoof &\nwalls\nHeat treat\nElectricity\nStores, machining, assembly, testing, dispatch, offices\nLocal materials\nMaterials\nWaste\nHeat\nLight\nHeat\nCompressor\nCompressed\nair\nMaterials\nHeat\nHeat lost\nGlobal sourced\nmaterials\nBiomass CHP\nElectricity\nOrganic waste\nFigure 5. Selected light and heat flows in a manufacturing operation.\nA third example shown in figure 6 illustrates selected high level flows for the application of the\nshot peening (e.g. [37]) process to a typical engineering component. The diagram shows the\nmanufacture of shot, its supply to the component manufacturing facility and its use for shot\npeening of leaf springs to increase their fatigue life. Shot is created using virgin raw material\nas well as scrap. The creation of shot and its use in surface treating components is energy\nintensive and potentially inefficient in its consumption of energy. Once in use however, the\ntreated component has a number of beneficial characteristics compared to an untreated\ncomponent. These include longer component life, lower component and hence product\nweight which in turn may result in significant energy savings during the use phase of the\nproduct. The balance of energy between the creation and use of the product can be modelled\nhere not just from understanding the energy flows within a facility but also how choices arising\nfrom design (material choice based on mechanical properties and the beneficial use of\nsurface treatments to reduce cost and overall energy consumption) and use phase can be\naccounted for.\nheat\ncomponent component\nsteel shot\nEnergy consumed\nin process\nheatExtract\/filterShot peen\nEnergy saved in\nproduct use\nEnergy balance\nproduce\nshotraw mat\u2019l\nscrap\nIncreased\nfatigue strength\nIncreased life\nLess\nmaterial\nCheaper\nmaterial\nHigher\nefficiency\nLower cost\nLess\nmaintenance\nRe-life &\nreuse\nFigure 6. Selected energy flows in the production and use of a shot peened product\n15\nLow and zero carbon technologies provide means of approaching zero carbon manufacture\nbut which technologies should be used? How are these technologies linked together?\nIntegrated, systems thinking approach is essential. Using the material, energy and waste\nflows of an entire facility, the impact of a technology can be seen in context. This approach\nmoves away from the thinking of utilising clean energy such as a wind turbine as a\nreplacement power source for current demand to thinking in a more integrated way. Taking\nthe water flow in a facility as an example, figure 4 showed how rainwater can be utilised for\ndifferent facility needs before being cleaned for lower cost entry into the sewer.\nThe material and energy flows integrate the domains of the facility designers and the process\nengineers. The flows can be jointly studied by specialists from these two fields to jointly\nidentify waste and opportunities to reduce waste by integrating flows rather than addressing\nthe individual wastes in their respective fields. The examples given are \u2018instances\u2019 of such an\nintegrative discussion taking place between facility and process engineers. Without such\nmaps as a catalyst for ideas and innovation such discussions would not take place.\n7 Challenges ahead\nThe awareness of zero carbon and associated technologies is rising fast but approaches to\ndesigning, implementing and improving manufacturing and service systems for zero carbon\nare lagging. Manufacturing and facility engineers seeking to design a zero carbon\nmanufacturing facility are faced with many decisions and many competing technological\nsolutions, often without having deep understanding of the individual solutions. We argue that\nintegration is more important than holding complete knowledge of all candidate technologies.\nDesign and improvement approaches should not be based around technology but should use\nan integrated systems approach to zero carbon. Such approaches should encourage inter-\ndisciplinary working and solutions.\nModelling of the material, energy and waste flows in a single, integrative manner is a start to\ntaking a multidisciplinary, systems approach to designing zero carbon manufacturing\nsystems. By modelling the facility as an integral part of the manufacturing system this\napproach enables a new set of potential interactions between process and building to be\nobserved, focussing on what is traditionally viewed as waste from one activity to be utilised by\nanother. Generic or process reference models of material, energy and waste flows have the\npotential to support system design and improvement activities. As a complementary tool they\nhave potential for influencing the creation and evaluation of new designs or improvements.\nThe modelling approach presented is qualitative and can act as a catalyst for ideas.\nHowever, it is not quantitative and therefore does not assess the magnitude, location or\nquality of the flows. Nor is it dynamic and hence does not represent the timing of flows. The\nnext stage of this research is examining the location, magnitude, quality and timing of the\nprocess flows using simulation. Hence making it possible, say, to assess the effectiveness of\nusing large volumes of intermittent warm water from one process as an input to another\nprocess elsewhere in a facility.\nThis paper has shown that generic flows of the pertinent characteristics of a zero carbon\nmanufacturing facility can be modelled, and shown how they can be instantiated around\nparticular technologies. Whilst the generic flows are not a design approach, in the same way\n16\nthat other process reference models are not either, they can act as a tool to support the\ndevelopment of a zero carbon manufacturing system. They are helpful in highlighting the\nneed to address the material and energy waste outputs of one activity and to prompt the\nsearch for another activity, thus promoting the understanding of the wider lifecycles rather\nthan the functional operation.\nWork has started on examining the cost drivers of the material, energy and waste flows but\nsignificant further development is needed to capture the full life cost. Ultimately, to be of most\nbenefit, such flow modelling use needs to be guided by revised system design and\nimprovement methodologies. Work is needed on design methodologies that take a wider view\nof the manufacturing system life cycle and guide the creation of efficient yet low carbon\nmanufacturing systems.\nWords ~6,250.\nReferences\n1 Elkington, J.
