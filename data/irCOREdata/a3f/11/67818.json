By the pth Schreier space, denoted Sp, we understand the Banach space\nobtained by completing c00 (the vector space of finitely supported scalar sequences) with\nrespect to the norm\n\u2016x\u2016Sp := sup\n{( k\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1nj |p\n) 1\np\n: k, n1, . . . , nk \u2208 N, k 6 n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk\n}\n, (1.1)\nwhere x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 c00. The space S1 is the one which is usually known as the Schreier space\nin the literature; it was formally introduced by Beauzamy and Laprest\u00e9 [3], building on ideas\nfrom Baernstein\u2019s thesis [2], which in turn were inspired by Schreier\u2019s seminal construction [9].\nThe Schreier spaces have recently been amalgamated with James\u2019 quasi-reflexive Banach\nspaces [6] by Bird and Laustsen [5]. More precisely, for 1 6 p < \u221e, the pth James\u2013Schreier\nspace, denoted Vp, is the completion of c00 with respect to the norm\n\u2016x\u2016Vp := sup\n{( k\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1nj \u2212 \u03b1nj+1 |p\n) 1\np\n:\nk, n1, . . . , nk+1 \u2208 N, k 6 n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1\n}\n, (1.2)\nwhere x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 c00. We refer to [5] for the background and motivation behind these\nspaces, as well as a thorough study of their fundamental properties. The purpose of this paper\nis to resolve two problems left open in [5].\n1\nFirst, it was shown in [5] that (en)n\u2208N, where en \u2208 c00 is the sequence with 1 in position n\nand 0 elsewhere, is a Schauder basis for Vp for each p > 1 and, moreover, that this basis\nis shrinking (meaning that the associated sequence of biorthogonal functionals (e\u2032n)n\u2208N is a\nSchauder basis for the dual space V \u2032p) whenever p > 1. The question of whether or not the\nbasis (en)n\u2208N is shrinking for p = 1 was left open; in Section 2 we answer this question in the\npositive. As a consequence, we deduce that V1 does not have Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u) and\nhence does not embed in a Banach space with an unconditional Schauder basis.\nSecond, regarding embeddings and isomorphisms of Schreier and James\u2013Schreier spaces,\nit was proved in [5] that:\n(i) for each p > 1, Sp is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of Vp;\n(ii) for each p > 1, Vp does not embed in Sq for any q > 1; this result extends to the case\np = 1 by the conclusions of Section 2 of the present paper.\nWe complete this picture in Section 3 by proving that, for q > p > 1, no subspace of Vq is\nisomorphic to Sp, and consequently no subspace of Sq is isomorphic to Sp, and no subspace\nof Vq is isomorphic to Vp. In particular, Sp \u001d Sq and Vp \u001d Vq whenever p 6= q.\n2 The standard basis for the first James\u2013Schreier space is\nshrinking\nAs the title indicates, the aim of this section is to prove the following result.\n2.1 Theorem. The standard Schauder basis (en)n\u2208N for V1 is shrinking.\nThe proof of Theorem 2.1 relies on two lemmas. Before presenting these, we recall some\nnotation and terminology from [5]. Throughout, K denotes the scalar field; either K = R or\nK = C. We write cardA for the cardinality of a (typically finite) set A. Suppose that A is a\nsubset of N. We then write A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk} to indicate that A is finite and non-\nempty and that {n1, n2, . . . , nk} is the increasing ordering of A. We say that A is admissible\nif 1 6 cardA 6 minA and permissible if 2 6 cardA 6 1 + minA. Thus a typical admissible\nset has the form {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk}, where 1 6 k 6 n1, while a typical permissible set can\nbe written as {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1}, again with 1 6 k 6 n1.\nNow let 1 6 p < \u221e. For x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 c00 and A \u2286 N, let \u00b5p(x,A) :=\n(\u2211\nn\u2208A |\u03b1n|p\n) 1\np .\nThe pth Schreier norm of x \u2208 c00 defined by (1.1) can then be expressed as\n\u2016x\u2016Sp = sup\n{\n\u00b5p(x,A) : A \u2286 N is admissible\n}\n.\nSimilarly, for x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 c00 and A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} \u2286 N, where k \u2208 N, let\n\u03bdp(x,A) :=\n(\u2211k\nj=1 |\u03b1nj \u2212 \u03b1nj+1 |p\n) 1\np . The pth James\u2013Schreier norm of x \u2208 c00 from (1.2) is\nthen given by\n\u2016x\u2016Vp = sup\n{\n\u03bdp(x,A) : A \u2286 N is permissible\n}\n.\nWe are now ready to embark on the proof of Theorem 2.1. The Schreier counterpart of\nthis theorem \u2014 that the standard unit vector basis for S1 is shrinking \u2014 is well-known; a\nproof can be found in [5, Proposition 3.10]. We shall follow a similar strategy here; more care\nis, however, required to construct a suitable embedding of V1 into a space of the form C(\u2126).\nIt should be noted that our proof (specifically, Lemma 2.3) relies on the fact that the standard\nunit vector basis for S1 is shrinking.\n2\n2.2 Lemma. (i) Let A = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < n2k} be a permissible subset of N of even\ncardinality. Then the functional\n\u03b7A : (\u03b1n)n\u2208N 7\u2192\nk\u2211\nj=1\n(\u03b1n2j\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1n2j ), c00 \u2192 K,\nextends to a contractive functional on V1.\n(ii) For each x \u2208 c00, there is a permissible subset A of N of even cardinality such that\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u03b5\u2016x\u2016V1 , where\n\u03b5 :=\n{\n1\n2 for K = R\n1\n4 for K = C.\n(2.1)\nProof. (i). Linearity of \u03b7A is clear, while contractivity follows from the fact that\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7A\u3009\u2223\u2223 6 k\u2211\nj=1\n|\u03b1n2j\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1n2j | 6 \u03bd1(x,A) 6 \u2016x\u2016V1\n(\nx = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 c00\n)\nbecause the set A is permissible.\n(ii). Suppose that x = (\u03b1n)n\u2208N \u2208 c00 is non-zero. We shall first consider the case where\n\u03b1n \u2208 R for each n \u2208 N. Choose a permissible set B = {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1} \u2286 N of minimal\ncardinality such that \u2016x\u2016V1 = \u03bd1(x,B). The minimality of cardB ensures that:\n(a) \u03b1nj 6= \u03b1nj+1 for each j \u2208 {1, . . . , k}, because if \u03b1nj = \u03b1nj+1 for some j, then\n\u03bd1(x,B) = \u03bd1\n(\nx,B \\ {nj}\n)\n;\n(b) if \u03b1nj > \u03b1nj+1 for some j \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, then \u03b1nj+1 < \u03b1nj+2 ; the reason is that the\nassumption \u03b1nj > \u03b1nj+1 > \u03b1nj+2 would imply that\n\u03bd1(x,B) =\nj\u22121\u2211\n`=1\n|\u03b1n` \u2212 \u03b1n`+1 |+ (\u03b1nj \u2212 \u03b1nj+1) + (\u03b1nj+1 \u2212 \u03b1nj+2)\n+\nk\u2211\n`=j+2\n|\u03b1n` \u2212 \u03b1n`+1 | = \u03bd1\n(\nx,B \\ {nj+1}\n)\n;\n(c) similarly, if \u03b1nj < \u03b1nj+1 for some j \u2208 {1, . . . , k \u2212 1}, then \u03b1nj+1 > \u03b1nj+2 .\nSince \u03bd1(x,B) = \u03bd1(\u2212x,B), we may suppose that \u03b1n1 > \u03b1n2 ; observations (b)\u2013(c) then imply\nthat \u03b1n1 > \u03b1n2 < \u03b1n3 > \u03b1n4 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nWe now split in two cases, depending on the parity of k. For k even, we see that\n\u2016x\u2016V1 = \u03bd1(x,B) =\nk\/2\u2211\nj=1\n(\n(\u03b1n2j\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1n2j ) + (\u03b1n2j+1 \u2212 \u03b1n2j )\n)\n=\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7C\u3009\u2223\u2223+ \u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7D\u3009\u2223\u2223, (2.2)\nwhere we have introduced C := {n1 < n2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk} and D := {n2 < n3 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk+1}.\nEach of these two sets is permissible and has even cardinality, and (2.2) implies that either\nA := C or A := D must satisfy\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2016x\u2016V1\/2.\n3\nWhen k is odd, a similar calculation shows that \u2016x\u2016V1 =\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7B\u3009\u2223\u2223 + \u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7E\u3009\u2223\u2223, where\nE := {n2 < n3 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < nk}. Hence either A := B or A := E satisfies\n\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2016x\u2016V1\/2, and\nin both cases A is permissible and has even cardinality. This completes the proof in the real\ncase.\nNow suppose that K = C, and define y := (Re\u03b1n)n\u2208N and z := (Im\u03b1n)n\u2208N. Then\nwe have x = y + iz, so that \u2016x\u2016V1 6 \u2016y\u2016V1 + \u2016z\u2016V1 and thus either \u2016y\u2016V1 > \u2016x\u2016V1\/2 or\n\u2016z\u2016V1 > \u2016x\u2016V1\/2. We consider the first case only; the second is similar. As y has real co-\nordinates, the first part of the argument applies, yielding a permissible set A of even cardinality\nsuch that\n\u2223\u2223\u3008y, \u03b7A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2016y\u2016V1\/2, and consequently we have\u2223\u2223\u3008x, \u03b7A\u3009\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u3008y, \u03b7A\u3009+ i\u3008z, \u03b7A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2223\u2223\u3008y, \u03b7A\u3009\u2223\u2223 > \u2016y\u2016V12 > \u2016x\u2016V14 ,\nas required. 2\n2.3 Lemma. For each bounded functional f on V1, the set E(f) :=\n{\nn \u2208 N : \u3008en, f\u3009 = 1\n}\nis\nfinite.\nProof. For clarity, we write (dn)n\u2208N for the standard unit vector basis for S1 in this proof,\nwhile (en)n\u2208N denotes the standard basis for V1, as usual; thus dn = en as vectors, but we\nregard the former as an element of S1, while the latter belongs to V1.\nIt suffices to prove that each of the sets E(f)\u2229 2N and E(f)\u2229 (2N\u2212 1) is finite. To verify\nthe first of these assertions, we note that, by [5, Proposition 4.10], we have a bounded operator\n\u03a6: S1 \u2192 V1 given by \u03a6dn := e2n for each n \u2208 N. Denoting by \u03a6\u2032 the adjoint of this operator,\nwe find\n\u3008e2n, f\u3009 = \u3008\u03a6dn, f\u3009 = \u3008dn,\u03a6\u2032f\u3009 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e\nbecause the basis (dn)n\u2208N for S1 is shrinking, and consequently the set E(f) \u2229 2N is finite.\nThe second assertion is an easy consequence of this. Indeed, by [5, Proposition 4.18(i)],\nthe left shift given by \u039be1 := 0 and \u039ben+1 := en for each n \u2208 N defines a contractive\noperator on V1. Since \u3008e2n\u22121, f\u3009 = \u3008\u039be2n, f\u3009 = \u3008e2n,\u039b\u2032f\u3009 for each n \u2208 N, we see that\nE(f) \u2229 (2N \u2212 1) = (E(\u039b\u2032f) \u2229 2N) \u2212 1, and the latter set is finite by the first part of the\nproof (applied to the functional \u039b\u2032f instead of f). 2\nProof of Theorem 2.1. By a standard characterization of shrinking bases (e.g., see [1, Proposi-\ntion 3.2.7]), we must prove that every normalized block basic sequence (un)n\u2208N of the standard\nbasis (en)n\u2208N for V1 is weakly null.\nThe Banach\u2013Alaoglu Theorem implies that the set\n\u2126 :=\n{\nf \u2208 V \u20321 : \u2016f\u2016V \u20321 6 1 and \u3008en, f\u3009 \u2208 {0,\u00b11} (n \u2208 N)\n}\nis a compact Hausdorff space when equipped with the weak*-topology inherited from the\ndual space V \u20321 of V1. By the definition of this topology, the mapping Ux : \u2126\u2192 K given by\n(Ux)f := \u3008x, f\u3009 for each f \u2208 \u2126 is continuous for each x \u2208 V1, so it induces a mapping\nU : V1 \u2192 C(\u2126) which is easily seen to be linear and contractive. Moreover, the functional \u03b7A\nfrom Lemma 2.2(i) belongs to \u2126 whenever A is a permissible subset of N of even cardinality,\nso Lemma 2.2(ii) implies that U is bounded below by the number \u03b5 given by (2.1). In other\nwords, U is an isomorphism of V1 onto its image inside C(\u2126). Since the weak topology on\nthe image of U is just the restriction of the weak topology on C(\u2126), we conclude that the\nsequence (un)n\u2208N is weakly null in V1 if and only if (Uun)n\u2208N is weakly null in C(\u2126).\n4\nTo prove the latter statement, by the Jordan Decomposition, it suffices to verify that\n\u3008Uun, \u03bb\u3009 \u2192 0 as n\u2192\u221e for each state \u03bb on C(\u2126). The Riesz Representation Theorem implies\nthat \u03bb is given by\n\u3008g, \u03bb\u3009 =\n\u222b\n\u2126\ng d\u03c1\n(\ng \u2208 C(\u2126))\nfor some probability measure \u03c1 on \u2126. Now we observe that:\n(a) for each f \u2208 \u2126, the sequence ((Uun)(f))n\u2208N = (\u3008un, f\u3009)n\u2208N is 0 eventually; the reason is\nthat, on the one hand, Lemma 2.3 implies that the set N := E(f)\u222aE(\u2212f) is finite, and\nby the definition of \u2126, \u3008en, f\u3009 = 0 for each n \u2208 N \\N , while on the other the fact that\n(un)n\u2208N is a block basic sequence of (en)n\u2208N implies that there is a natural number n0\nsuch that un \u2208 span{ej : j > maxN} whenever n > n0;\n(b) the constant function 1 is \u03c1-integrable and dominates\n(|Uun|)n\u2208N.\nIn particular, (a) implies that the sequence (Uun)n\u2208N converges pointwise to 0 on \u2126, and so,\nby Lebesgue\u2019s Dominated Convergence Theorem, we have\n\u3008Uun, \u03bb\u3009 =\n\u222b\n\u2126\nUun d\u03c1\u2192\n\u222b\n\u2126\n0 d\u03c1 = 0 as n\u2192\u221e,\nas required. 2\n2.4 Remark. The fact that the basis for V1 is shrinking is in sharp contrast to the situation\nfor the first James space J1. Indeed, J1 is isomorphic to `1, so no basis for it can be shrinking.\nLohman and Casazza [7] have generalized James\u2019 construction to produce quasi-reflexive spaces\nfrom Banach spaces with a symmetric basis other than `p for p > 1; however, as in James\u2019\nclassical case, they only establish that the basis for their new spaces is shrinking when p > 1\n(see [7, Theorem 9]).\nFinally in this section we observe that V1 does not have the property (u) introduced by\nPe\u0142czy\u0144ski [8], thus answering another question left open in [5]. Indeed, since we now know\nthat the standard basis for V1 is shrinking, we can copy the proof of [5, Theorem 6.3] verbatim\nto reach the desired conclusion.\n2.5 Theorem. The first James\u2013Schreier space V1 does not have Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u)\nand hence does not embed in any Banach space with an unconditional basis. In particular,\nV1 does not embed in Sp for any p > 1.\n3 Any two Schreier or James\u2013Schreier spaces with distinct\nindices are non-isomorphic\nRather than establishing the results stated in the title of this section directly, we take a unified\napproach based on the following, slightly more general, lemma. As in the proof of Lemma 2.3,\nwe write (dn)n\u2208N for the unit vector basis for Sp, while (en)n\u2208N denotes the standard basis\nfor Vq.\n3.1 Lemma. Let q > p > 1, and let N be an infinite subset of N. Then no subspace of Vq is\nisomorphic to the subspace span {dn : n \u2208 N} of Sp.\n5\nProof. Assume towards a contradiction that R : span {dn : n \u2208 N} \u2192 Vq is a bounded operator\nwhich is bounded below by some \u03b4 > 0. Then, on the one hand, we have \u2016Rdn\u2016Vq > \u03b4 for each\nn \u2208 N , while on the other the sequence (dn)n\u2208N is weakly null because (dn)n\u2208N is a shrinking\nbasis for Sp, and therefore (Rdn)n\u2208N is also weakly null. Hence the Bessaga\u2013Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\nSelection Principle [4] implies that a subsequence of (Rdn)n\u2208N is a basic sequence equivalent to\na block basic sequence of (en)n\u2208N; that is, there exist a strictly increasing mapping \u03c3 : N\u2192 N\nand a bounded operator T : span {Rd\u03c3(n) : n \u2208 N} \u2192 Vq such that T is bounded below by some\n\u03b5 > 0 and (TRd\u03c3(n))n\u2208N is a block basic sequence of (en)n\u2208N. By [5, Lemma 4.13], this means in\nparticular that we have a bounded operator U : `q \u2192 Vq given by Ufn = TRd\u03c3(n)\/\u2016TRd\u03c3(n)\u2016Vq\nfor each n \u2208 N, where (fn)n\u2208N denotes the standard unit vector basis for `q. Thus, we conclude\nthat\n\u2016U\u2016 \u2016T\u2016 \u2016R\u2016n 1q >\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225U\n( 2n\u22121\u2211\nj=n\n\u2016TRd\u03c3(j)\u2016Vqfj\n)\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\nVq\n> \u03b5\u03b4\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u22252n\u22121\u2211\nj=n\nd\u03c3(j)\n\u2225\u2225\u2225\u2225\nSp\n= \u03b5\u03b4n\n1\np , (3.1)\nwhere the final equality follows from the admissibility of the set \u03c3\n(\n[n, 2n \u2212 1] \u2229 N) on which\nthe vector\n\u22112n\u22121\nj=n d\u03c3(j) is supported. Rearranging (3.1), we obtain\n\u2016U\u2016 \u2016T\u2016 \u2016R\u2016\n\u03b5\u03b4\n> n\n1\np\n\u2212 1\nq ,\nwhich is a contradiction because the left-hand side is independent of n, while the right-hand\nside tends to infinity as n\u2192\u221e. 2\n3.2 Theorem. Let q > p > 1. Then:\n(i) no subspace of Vq is isomorphic to Vp or Sp;\n(ii) no subspace of Sq is isomorphic to Sp or Vp.\nProof. (i). Taking N = N in Lemma 3.1, we see that no subspace of Vq is isomorphic to Sp.\nSince Vp contains a subspace isomorphic to Sp by [5, Proposition 4.10], this in turn implies\nthat no subspace of Vq can be isomorphic to Vp.\n(ii). If Sq contained a subspace isomorphic to Sp, then by the above-mentioned result\nfrom [5], Vq would also contain a subspace isomorphic to Sp, contradicting (i). Finally, for\nsimilar reasons Sq cannot contain a subspace isomorphic to Vp. 2\n3.3 Corollary. Let p, q > 1 be distinct. Then Vp \u001d Vq and Sp \u001d Sq.\n3.4 Remark. (i) The fact stated in Theorem 3.2(ii) that no subspace of Sq is isomorphic\nto Vp when q > p > 1 is actually true without any restrictions on p, q > 1. The reason is\nthat the James\u2013Schreier spaces all fail to have Pe\u0142czy\u0144ski\u2019s property (u) by Theorem 2.5\nand [5, Theorem 6.3], while each Schreier space has an unconditional basis.\n(ii) The conclusion of Lemma 3.1 (and thus that of Theorem 3.2) actually holds whenever\np, q > 1 are distinct. As this was not needed to prove our main result, Corollary 3.3,\nwe just give a brief sketch of the argument, which is by contradiction. As in the proof\nof Lemma 3.1, we obtain a normalized basic sequence (un) in Vq which is equivalent to\na subsequence of the unit vector basis for Sp. It follows that (un) is Schreier `p which\nmeans that there is a constant C > 0 such that (ui)i\u2208A is C-equivalent to the unit vector\nbasis of `kp for every admissible subset A of N, where k := cardA.\n6\nThere are now two cases. If, after passing to a subsequence, we have ||un||c0 \u2192 0 as\nn \u2192 \u221e, then a further subsequence of (un) is equivalent to the unit vector basis of c0;\nthe proof of this is similar to that of Vq being c0-saturated given in [5, Theorem 5.2].\nOtherwise there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that ||un||c0 > \u03b4 for each n \u2208 N. An easy computation\nthen shows that (u2i)i\u2208A is 3\u03b4 -equivalent to the unit vector basis of `\nk\nq for every admissible\nsubset A of N, where k := cardA. Both cases contradict the fact that (un) is a Schreier\n`p sequence.\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the EPSRC (Bird: grants EP\/P500303\/1,\nEP\/P501482\/1 and EP\/P502656X\/1; Laustsen and Zs\u00e1k: grant EP\/F023537\/1) that has en-\nabled us to carry out the research which this paper is based upon.\nWe should also like to thank Hung Le Pham for some helpful discussions regarding the\nresults presented in Section 3.\nReferences\n[1] F.
