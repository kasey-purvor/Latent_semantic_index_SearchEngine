The evidence cited by the government is\nlimited to reporting that socioeconomic disadvantage and educational attainment influence risk. Evidence\nregarding young people\u2019s attitude to school is not cited, and there is a lack of research concerning the UK.\nThis paper develops hypotheses on the relation between socioeconomic and educational dimensions of\nsocial exclusion, and risk of teenage pregnancy, by examining whether dislike of school and\nsocioeconomic disadvantage are associated with cognitive\/behavioural risk measures among 13\/14\nyear olds in English schools.\nDesign: Analysis of data from the baseline survey of a study of sex education.\nSetting and participants: 13\/14 year old school students from south east England.\nMain results: The results indicate that socioeconomic disadvantage and dislike of school are associated\nwith various risk factors, each with a different pattern. Those disliking school, despite having comparable\nknowledge to those liking school, were more likely to have sexual intercourse, expect sexual intercourse by\nage 16, and expect to be parents by the age of 20. For most associations, the crude odds ratios (ORs) and\nthe ORs adjusted for the other exposure were similar, suggesting that inter-confounding between\nexposures was limited.\nConclusions: It is hypothesised that in determining risk of teenage pregnancy, the two exposures are\nindependent. Those disliking school might be at greater risk of teenage pregnancy because they are more\nlikely to see teenage pregnancy as inevitable or positive.\nT\nhe UK government has identified social exclusion as a\nkey determinant of teenage pregnancy. Social exclusion1\nentails individuals being disadvantaged not just econom-\nically but also in terms of other dimensions such as\neducation, citizenship, and cultural resources.2 3 The term\nsocial exclusion is also intended to draw attention to a process\nof accumulating disadvantage where different factors are\npivotal at different points in people\u2019s lives.4\nIn the UK government\u2019s strategy for reducing teenage\npregnancy,5 risk factors for teenage pregnancy are identified.\nSome, such as low socioeconomic status, encapsulate\neconomic dimensions of social exclusion. Others, such as\nnegative attitudes to school and low expectations about\nfuture education and employment, focus on educational\ndimensions of social exclusion.\nThe strategy cites evidence to support its assertion that\neconomic disadvantage is a determinant of teenage parent-\nhood.6 The strategy also cites evidence from Kiernan7 and\nInclude8 that young people in the UK with low educational\nattainment or who are excluded from school are at greater\nrisk of teenage parenthood. The strategy does not however\ncite evidence concerning another dimension of educational\ndisadvantage: dissatisfaction with school.\nExisting research on attitudes to education and risk of\nteenage pregnancy\nIs dislike of school an important determinant of teenage\npregnancy? To explore this question we first systematically\nreviewed existing quantitative research on the association\nbetween young people\u2019s attitudes to school and teenage\npregnancy. We used a search strategy that comprehensively\nidentified post-1991 published studies examining educa-\ntional attitudes, attendance, and attainment on pregnancy\nand other sexual health outcomes of teenagers and other\nyoung people, present on Medline and Embase. Two US\nstudies have examined associations between dissatisfaction\nwith school and risk of various sexual health outcomes.\nDearden et al found an association between teenage father-\nhood and disliking school, (OR = 3.2, 95% confidence\nintervals 2.1 to 4.8).9 Mott et al reported no association\nbetween boredom with school and sex by age 14.10 Paul et al\nreport an association among young people from New Zealand\nbetween positive attitude to school and sex by age 16 for\nboys, with an OR of 0.10 (95% confidence intervals of 0.03 to\n0.3).11 There was no association between attitude to school\nand sex by age 16 for girls.\nWe also reviewed relevant qualitative research. A qualita-\ntive study from the UK reports that lack of interest in, and\nexpectations about, education and subsequent employment\nmight affect risk of teenage pregnancy.12 A lack of educa-\ntional aspirations among some, but not all, young women\nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds engendered a sense of\nfatalism, making it difficult for them to make real choices\nabout sex and parenthood. For other young women, the lack\nof alternative aspirations informed a view that teenage\nparenthood might not be disruptive, and indeed might be a\npositive choice. This research involved a small sample and did\nnot attempt to generate statistically significant findings.\nIn summary therefore, existing quantitative studies show\nmixed results, and are not directly pertinent to contemporary\nUK society, while qualitative data cannot provide generali-\nsable evidence.\n871\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nStudy aims\nThis study attempted to develop hypotheses concerning the\neffect of differing aspects of social exclusion on young\npeople\u2019s risk of teenage pregnancy. It did so by examining the\nsocial circumstances, cognitions and behaviour of UK school\nstudents aged 13 and 14. We explored whether two\ndimensions of social exclusion\u2014socioeconomic disadvantage\nand dislike of school\u2014are each associated with cognitions\nand behaviours, which may predict risk of future teenage\nparenthood. The study aimed to develop hypotheses con-\ncerning causality, which will be tested in later longitudinal\nanalyses of data from the same study.\nMETHODS\nData collection\nWe analysed data arising from a baseline survey of mixed sex\nstate secondary school year 9 students (aged 13 and 14)\nwithin a cluster randomised controlled trial of peer led sex\neducation. Twenty seven schools in central and southern\nEngland entered the study in the spring and summer of 1997.\nDetails of the study, which is still in progress, have been\npublished elsewhere.13 Questionnaires were designed in\nconsultation with students, extensively piloted and addressed\ndemography, sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviour,\nother behaviours, and views on school and sex education.14 In\nthese baseline questionnaires \u2018\u2018sex\u2019\u2019 was defined as hetero-\nsexual sexual intercourse. Students completed the question-\nnaires in lesson time. Permission was sought from all\nparents\/carers to include their children in the study. The\nstudy was approved by University College London commit-\ntees on the ethics of human research.\nData analysis\nTwo items were pre-hypothesised as \u2018\u2018exposures\u2019\u2019, these\nfocusing on various possible dimensions of social exclusion.\nFirstly, socioeconomic status was measured via self reported\nhousing tenure. Students reporting that they lived in non-\nprivately owned housing were defined as \u2018\u2018disadvantaged\u2019\u2019.\nData from this question were more complete than for\nquestions about parental occupation. In addition, it has been\nargued that this may be a more valid measure of socio-\neconomic status for people other than adult men.14 Secondly,\nattitude to school was measured with the statement \u2018\u2018I like\nschool\u2019\u2019. Students who disagreed or strongly disagreed with\nthis statement were defined as \u2018\u2018disliking school\u2019\u2019, those who\nneither agreed or disagreed were defined as being \u2018\u2018ambiva-\nlent\u2019\u2019.\nVarious items were pre-hypothesised as outcome mea-\nsures, these being possible predictors of subsequent risk of\nteenage parenthood (see discussion below). Knowledge\nabout sex and contraception was indicated by 13 questions\nabout contraception and safer sex. Students not answering\ncorrectly at least 7 of 13 questions (all with equal weighting)\nwere considered to have low knowledge. Those who missed\nmore than one questions were excluded. Confidence about\ncondom use was indicated by a question asking how easy or\ndifficult it would be to use a condom properly. Low\nconfidence about condom use was indicated by viewing\ncondom use as \u2018\u2018difficult\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018very difficult\u2019\u2019, or being\n\u2018\u2018unsure\u2019\u2019 about this. Antipathy to condoms was indicated\nby students\u2019 being ambivalent, disagreeing or strongly\ndisagreeing that using a condom would be a smart thing to\ndo. A belief that peers are having sex was based on\nresponding that half or more of one\u2019s same sex peers have\nhad sex. An expectation that the young person will have\nsexual intercourse by age 16 was indicated by a positive\nresponse to a direct question on this matter. An expectation\nthat the young person will be a parent by age 20 was\nindicated by the young person responding that this was likely\nor very likely, and those who where unsure were removed\nfrom the analysis of association with the two exposures.\nSelf reported behaviour was also explored. Regularly being\ndrunk was indicated by respondents reporting they have been\ndrunk once a month or more. Sexual activity was indicated\nby self reported experience of having had sex. In addition\nsome students were reclassified as not having had sex where\nlater questionnaire responses indicated they had never had\nsex, and some of those students who omitted the question\ncould be re-classified using the age at first sex provided in\nlater questionnaires. Sex in itself, rather than use of condoms\nin sex, was focused on principally because the proportion of\nthe sample having had sex meant that an examination of the\nlatter outcome would be statistically underpowered. Analysis\nof young people\u2019s expectations about whether they would\nhave sex by age 16 included only those who had not already\nhad sex, as actual experience of sex was examined separately.\nAssociations between the outcomes and, in turn, housing\ntenure and attitude to school, stratified by gender were\nexamined. Interactions betweens the effect on outcomes of\nthe two exposures were then explored. Odds ratios generated\nin logistic regression are reported. All analysis took account\nof clustering of participants within schools, using the survey\nanalysis functions of Stata 6.\nRESULTS\nA total of 9691 students were enrolled in year 9 in the 27\nschools in 1997 and 1998. One hundred and eighty three\nwere withdrawn from the study by their parents. Of those\neligible, 8766 (92%) completed baseline questionnaires; 4248\n(48%) were girls and 4518 (52%) were boys. Ninety one per\ncent described themselves as \u2018\u2018white\u2019\u2019 and 9% as Indian,\nPakistani, Bangladeshi, Black African, Black Caribbean,\nChinese, or other. The mean age was 13 years and 8 months\n(13.69, SD 0.32).\nData describing the sample in terms of exposure and\noutcome measures are reported in table 1. Just over one\nquarter of boys and girls lived in non owner-occupier housing\nand so is classified for the purposes of this study as\nsocioeconomically disadvantaged. While 23.2% of boys\ndisliked or strongly disliked school, only 15.4% of girls did\nso. Knowledge of sex and contraception was low: around half\nof boys and girls could not answer seven or more questions\ncorrectly. Lack of confidence or uncertainty about condom\nuse was much greater among girls (64.0%) than boys\n(35.4%). About 10% of girls and 14% of boys did not agree\nor strongly agree with a statement that use of condoms was a\nsmart thing to do, and were thus classified as antipathetic to\ncondom use. About 8% of both boys and girls thought half or\nmore of their gender and age peers were sexually active.\nNearly half of students who answered the relevant question\nthought it likely or very likely they would be sexually active\nby age 16. More boys (20.7%) than girls (15.5%) thought they\nwould be likely or very likely to become teenage parents. In\nterms of behaviour, about 13% of both boys and girls reported\nbeing drunk monthly or more, and 6.7% of boys and girls\nreported already having sex.\nTable 2 reports on the associations between each of the two\nexposures. Among the overall sample, only 6.7% were\nsocioeconomically disadvantaged and disliked school, while\n34.2% of the sample either was socioeconomically disadvan-\ntaged or disliked school but not both. This pattern was\nsimilar for boys and girls when analysed separately.\nTables 3 and 4 report on the associations between,\nrespectively, socioeconomic status (as indicated by housing\ntenure), and attitude to school and each of our pre-\nhypothesised outcomes, stratified by gender. Each table\nreports crude ORs (with 95% confidence intervals) and ORs\nfor associations adjusted for the other exposure. In summary,\n872 Bonell, Strange, Stephenson, et al\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nour various hypothesised dimensions of social exclusion were\nsubject to a number of associations, as follows.\n(1) Among boys and girls, socioeconomic disadvantage\nwas significantly and independently associated with: low\nknowledge about sex and contraception (adjusted OR, girls\n1.81 (CI 1.45 to 2.27), boys 1.48 (CI 1.22 to 1.80)); negative or\nambivalent attitudes to condom use (1.82 (CI 1.39 to 2.38),\n1.51 (CI 1.15 to 2.00)); a belief that most peers are already\nhaving sex (2.00 (CI 1.52 to 2.65), 1.88 (CI 1.39 to 2.56)); an\nexpectation of being a parent by age 20 (2.34 (CI 1.87 to\n2.93), 1.91 (1.53 to 2.39)), and having sexual intercourse\n(1.44 (CI 1.08 to 1.93), 1.89 (CI 1.38 to 2.59)).

Dislike of school was also associated with\nhigher confidence regarding condom use (0.77 (0.62 to 0.95),\n0.77 (0.64 to 0.92)). Ambivalence towards school was\nassociated with being drunk monthly or more (1.62 (1.37\nto 1.93), 1.63 (1.16 to 2.29)) and expecting to have sex by\naged 16 (1.51 (1.18 to 1.91), 1.31 (1.12 to 1.55)) for girls and\nboys and believing most peers have sexual intercourse (1.49\n(1.03 to 2.15)) and having sexual intercourse (1.40 (1.03 to\n1.92)) for girls but not boys.\nAdjusted Wald tests indicated that there were no sig-\nnificant interactions between the effects of socioeconomic\nstatus and attitude to school on any of the outcomes.\nAdjusting for having had sex did not substantially affect\nassociations concerning knowledge and confidence, and so\nwas not included in multivariate models. Adjusting the\nmeasure of low knowledge about contraception and STIs so\nthat this was defined as students having not correctly\nanswered a greater or fewer number of questions (that is,\neight rather than seven) made no difference to the patterns of\nassociations found regarding this variable.\nDISCUSSION\nOur two dimensions of social exclusion\u2014socioeconomic\ndisadvantage and dislike of school\u2014are both associated with\ndifferent risk factors for teenage pregnancy. Even in this\nbaseline cross sectional survey it is clear that social inequal-\nities in sexual health risk (measured by a variety of cognitive\nand behavioural measures) exist among 13 and 14 year olds.\nSocioeconomic disadvantage was associated with low\nknowledge about sex and contraception, but not with\nexpectations of sexual intercourse before age 16. In contrast,\ndislike of school was not associated with low knowledge, but\nwas associated with expectations about having sex before age\n16. Our findings suggest that both exposures might influence\nthe risk of teenage pregnancy, and that dislike of school\nseems potentially to be particularly important, in that its\nassociation with behavioural measures is especially strong.\nBecause the crude and adjusted ORs are quite similar,\ninter-confounding is relatively insignificant. We therefore\nhypothesise that in determining risk of teenage pregnancy,\nour two dimensions of social exclusion affect somewhat\ndifferent groups of individuals, and in this sense could be\ncalled independent. This possibility is consistent with the\nqualitative finding of Hughes et al that only some young\nwomen from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds\nhave low expectations concerning their careers. It may also be\nthat only some young people who dislike school are socio-\neconomically disadvantaged (at least according to our\nmeasure of housing tenure\u2014see below), but that many such\nindividuals are at increased risk of future teenage pregnancy.\nThis possibility is supported by the only partial overlap\nbetween socioeconomic status and dislike of school, indicated\nin table 2.\nWe found that those who disliked school did not have\nlower knowledge levels than those who liked school but none\nthe less were more likely to be or to expect to be sexually\nactive by age 16, and to expect to be parents by age 20. From\nthis, we might hypothesise how educational dimensions of\nsocial exclusion might operate in increasing the risk of\nteenage pregnancy. Willis reported that, for some young\npeople, the ethos and values embedded in school resulted in\ntheir feeling alienated from it, and adopting attitudes and\nbehaviour that run counter to those promoted in it.16 A\nsimilar process might explain our results, namely that young\npeople who dislike school (that is, are alienated from school)\nmight be more likely to come to see teenage pregnancy as\ninevitable or as positive alternative to continuing education\nor a career.\nHowever, we should caution that firm conclusions about\ncausality should be made on the basis of an empirical\nexamination of temporality,17 which is not possible in this\ncross sectional study. It may, for example, be that, rather than\nalienation from school causing young people to engage in\ncertain behaviours and hold certain views, it is actually\nengagement with these behaviours and views that increases\nyoung people\u2019s feelings of disengagement with school. This\nquestion will be considered in future research, discussed\nbelow.\nFurthermore, we cannot be certain about the validity of\nsome of our measures. Regarding our measures of exposure,\nthe greater consistency of associations regarding dislike of\nschool compared with socioeconomic disadvantage might, in\nlarge part, reflect the greater proportion of students answer-\ning this question. Our measure of housing tenure may not\nhave been highly valid, perhaps because a question on this\nmay be difficult for students to answer. However, our results\nare broadly in line with the findings of the 1991 UK census,\nin which 74% report owner occupation (72% this sample),\n18% renting from local authority (22% this sample), and 8%\nprivate renting (5% this sample).18 No other individual\nmeasures of socioeconomic disadvantage were available,\nexcept parental occupation, which had a very poor response\nrate. Indices of deprivation could not be used, both because of\nthe poor completion of postcode information by respondents,\nand because these report area, not individual, disadvantage\nand so would shed no light on the research questions we are\nexploring. In addition there may be limitations to the\nconclusions that can be drawn about the relation between\nsatisfaction with school and sexual health outcomes based on\nthe use of a single response about \u2018\u2018liking\/disliking\u2019\u2019school.\nFurther research might be strengthened by developing\nadditional measures to capture other aspects of this multi-\nfaceted concept.\nRegarding our measures of outcome, while research\nindicates that cognitive measures (that is, knowledge,\nconfidence, and attitudes) are associated with behavioural\nmeasures (such as condom use) among young people,\nevidence concerning associations between these measures\nand teenage pregnancy is inconclusive.19 20 Furthermore, the\nvalidity of young people\u2019s expectations about sexual initiation\nand conception in predicting risk of teenage pregnancy has\nnot been researched. Our measure of confidence with proper\nuse of condoms may have indicated different phenomena in\nboys and girls. While, for boys, it might have indicated\nconfidence about the mechanics of using condoms, for girls, it\nmay have indicated confidence in negotiating condom use. The\nhigh rate of \u2018\u2018unsure\u2019\u2019 responses to this question might\nsuggest respondents found the question difficult. A possible\nlack of validity of our measure of confidence in condom use\nmight explain our findings of inverse associations between\nboth dislike of school and socioeconomic disadvantage and\nlow confidence in using condoms. Alternatively, this finding\nmight suggest that young people who do not perceive teenage\npregnancy primarily in terms of negative risk are less inclined\nto question their skill in using condoms. Existing research\ndoes support the validity of alcohol use and early initiation of\nsex as predictors of teenage pregnancy.17 21 22 However, we\nacknowledge that the outcome measures we have used here\nare imperfect, early indicators of risk of teenage pregnancy,\nand plan to test the hypotheses developed in this paper in\nfuture research in which the key outcome will be teenage\npregnancy itself. Such research will be longitudinal, and will\ntherefore examine the extent to which prior educational\nalienation and later sexual health risk are associated\ntemporally and statistically. Such temporal analysis will add\nto the evidence regarding causality (see Bradford Hill\u2019s\ncriteria)23 but will not, on its own, be definitive.\nSocial exclusion and teenage pregnancy 875\nwww.jech.com\n on 5 November 2009 jech.bmj.comDownloaded from \nCONCLUSION\nSocial inequalities in various markers of sexual health risk,\nincluding early initiation of sexual activity, are apparent\namong 13 and 14 year olds. We hypothesise that different\ndimensions of young people\u2019s social exclusion may affect\nfuture risk of teenage pregnancy in different ways and that\nalienation from education may be a particularly important\ndimension of exclusion in the determination of risk of\nteenage pregnancy. Socially excluded young people may be\nmore likely to become pregnant as teenagers not because of\nknowledge or confidence deficits but because their alienation\nfrom school and more general social exclusion results in their\nadopting fatalistic or positive attitudes to parenthood in their\nteenage years. For some young people, having a baby may, in\nthis context, represent a positive and achievable goal. This\npossibility, if confirmed in later longitudinal analysis would\nhave important implications for teachers and educational and\nsocial policy makers in responding to social exclusion among\nyoung people in the UK and perhaps elsewhere.\nAuthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nC P Bonell, V J Strange, A R Oakley, Social Science Research Unit,\nInstitute of Education, University of London, UK\nJ M Stephenson, A J Copas, S P Forrest, A M Johnson, S Black,\nDepartment of Sexually Transmitted Infections, University College\nLondon, University of London, UK\nFunding: UK Medical Research Council funding for two projects\nrespectively entitled: \u2018\u2018Examining socio-economic and cultural determi-\nnants of teenage sexual health\u2019\u2019; and \u2018\u2018A randomized controlled trial of\nthe effectiveness of peer-led sex education in schools\u2019\u2019.\nConflicts of interest: none declared.\nREFERENCES\n1 Golding P.
