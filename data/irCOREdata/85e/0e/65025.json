That is, it is simul-\ntaneously a special political language of counter-terrorism with its own\nassumptions, symbolic systems, rhetorical modes and tropes, metaphors, nar-\nratives and meanings, and its own exclusive forms of knowledge. It is a dis-\ntinct discourse, analogous to discourses in other fields\u2014advertising, medicine,\neducation, art, psychology, and the like. If we are to fully understand how the\n\u201cwar on terrorism\u201d functions as a particular kind of political project, I believe\nthat in addition to explaining its military, political, and economic dimensions,\nwe must also appreciate how this particular discourse has been constructed\nRichard Jackson is a Lecturer in International Security at The University of Manchester.\nHis most recent book is Writing the war on terrorism: Language, politics and counter-\nterrorism (Manchester University Press, 2005).\nAddress correspondence to Dr Richard Jackson, Government and International Poli-\ntics, School of Social Sciences, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester\nM13 9PL, United Kingdom. E-mail: Richard.jackson@manchester.ac.uk\n148 R. Jackson\nand how it functions to legitimize and normalize the institutional practices of\ncounter-terrorism.\nThe analysis of public political discourse as a methodological approach\nreveals how some forms of knowledge are privileged over others, how identity\nis constructed and maintained, how power is legitimized, how political and\ninstitutional practices are normalized, and in this case, how social and politi-\ncal consensus is produced and reproduced ideationally. Political discourses are\nnot neutral reflections of social and political reality; rather, they are partly\nconstitutive of that reality\u2014they have a reality-making effect. The practice of\nthe \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d in its military and political dimensions would not be\npossible without the accompanying language or discourse of counter-terrorism:\ndiscourse and practice are interdependent or co-constitutive. Moreover,\npolitical discourses possess a clear ideological character; they are the con-\nstruction and deployment of \u201cmeaning in the service of power.\u201d2 Or, more\nspecifically, discourses act as constructions of meaning that contribute to the\nproduction, reproduction, and transformation of relations of domination in\nsociety.3\nApplying a critical discourse analysis (CDA) method,4 the primary phase\nof this research involved an examination of over 100 speeches of senior mem-\nbers of the Bush administration from September 11, 2001 to December 31,\n2003. These texts were a representative sample of the more than 5,000\nspeeches, interviews, radio broadcasts, and press conferences on the subject of\nterrorism during this period. Included in this sample were speeches accorded\nsymbolic importance, such as the Address to Congress and the American People\non 20 September, 2001, the State of the Union Addresses, and anniversary\nand commemorative speeches. The remaining speeches were selected to\ninclude a range of speakers (as many senior administration officials as possi-\nble, as well as a sample of junior officials), and a range of dates covering the\nentire period.\nThe aim of the analysis was to uncover the primary discursive construc-\ntions at the heart of the \u201cwar on terrorism,\u201d to examine the ways in which the\nlanguage of counter-terrorism has been produced, deployed, and reproduced\nin public political rhetoric, and to assess the effects of the discourse on demo-\ncratic politics. The central argument is fairly simple. The language of the\n\u201cwar on terrorism\u201d is not a neutral or objective reflection of policy debates\nand the realities of terrorism and counter-terrorism. Rather, it is a very care-\nfully and deliberately constructed\u2014but ultimately, artificial\u2014discourse that\nwas specifically designed to make the war seem reasonable, responsible, and\n\u201cgood,\u201d as well as to silence any forms of knowledge or counter-argument that\nwould challenge the exercise of state power. More than merely public rela-\ntions, \u201cpublic diplomacy,\u201d or propaganda then, the effects of this discourse are\nto normalize, legitimize, and in a sense, actualize its institutional practice.\nMore importantly, the discourse of the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d, as it is presently\nSecurity, Democracy 149\nconstructed, poses severe challenges to the healthy functioning of democratic\nsociety.\nWRITING THE WAR ON TERRORISM\nThe primary constructions of the administration\u2019s public discourse revolve\naround four main themes. First, and foundationally, the events of September\n11, 2001 had to be discursively constructed and assigned a particular set of\nmeanings; they did not \u201cspeak for themselves.\u201d Rather, the interpretation of\n\u201c9\u201311\u201d came to be fixed by the official discourse in such a way that it only\nhad meaning in the context of certain officially accepted narratives. Second,\nthe discourse constructed or re-affirmed new identities for both the vic-\ntims\u2014innocent, heroic and good Americans\u2014, and the villains of the moral-\nity play\u2014the evil, barbarous, and inhuman terrorists. Third, a central\nfeature of the discourse involved the construction of the threat and danger of\nterrorism, which was re-made as immanent and catastrophic to democracy,\nfreedom, civilization, and the American way of life; that is, it was re-\nconstructed as a danger on the scale of Nazism and Communism. A fourth\nimportant aspect of the discourse involved the attempt to legitimize and nor-\nmalize the quintessential \u201cgood war\u201d\u2014a popular narrative in American\nsociety and political discourse\u2014as the primary response to these acts of\nterrorism (or \u201cwar\u201d).\nThere were, and still are, a variety of rhetorical and discursive strategies\nemployed in these primary constructions. John Murphy argues that President\nBush almost solely employed an epideictic rhetorical mode in his \u201cwar on ter-\nrorism\u201d texts. That is, Bush\u2019s rhetoric \u201cshapes the world that provides the\nbackdrop of values and beliefs, heroes and villains, triumphs and tragedies\nagainst which and through which deliberative and forensic judgments are\nmade in a ceaseless swirl of discourse.\u201d5 In keeping with this primary genre,\nthe discourse relies on a powerful mix of analogy (\u201cAl Qaeda is to terrorism what\nthe mafia is to crime\u201d), amplification (Al Qaeda wanted to \u201ckill all Americans\u201d),\nuse of visual imagery (Bush carrying the \u201cpolice shield of a man named George\nHoward who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others\u201d), popular\nentertainment tropes (the \u201cAmerican hero\u201d), foundational meta-narratives\n(Pearl Harbor and World War II, the fight for Civilization), and a ubiquitous\nover-arching Manichean frame (good versus evil, \u201ceither you are with us or\nyou are with the terrorists\u201d).\nWhat follows then, is a brief overview of the primary discursive con-\nstructions of the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d; a much more in-depth treatment can\nbe found elsewhere.6 In the conclusion to the paper, I examine some of the\nmost important features of the overall discourse and assess the particular\ndangers to democratic society of constructing counter-terrorism in this\nmode.\n150 R. Jackson\nConstructing September 11, 2001\nWhen the Twin Towers collapsed, it appeared as if language itself also col-\nlapsed. There seemed to be no words to express what the events actually signi-\nfied. In fact, acts of political violence never have clear or objective meanings;\nthey have to be interpreted by political leaders to determine the appropriate\nresponse (Iraq\u2019s invasion of Iran in 1980 was not interpreted as a threat to\nAmerica and the world; its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was). Added to this, the\nlive streaming images of the terrorist attacks, in a society characterized by a\nperennial sense of \u201chyper-reality,\u201d added to the loss of perspective. For many\nAmericans, the sense that what they were seeing was a movie, but that it was\neven more \u2018real\u2019 than a movie, was a genuine concern. After all, most Americans\nhad actually seen the destruction of New York before in countless disaster\nmovies like Deep Impact, Final Fantasy, and AI. That is, the spectacle of the\nattacks fractured the common rhetorical resources of a society raised on a\nsteady diet of virtual violence. Into this \u201cvoid of meaning,\u201d7 political leaders,\nparticularly President George W. Bush, inserted a politically-driven narrative\nthat has since come to dominate public interpretation of the events.\nThe most important aspects of this discursive construction of September 11,\n2001 were that first, it was continuously made and re-made as a \u201cnational\ntragedy\u201d (as opposed to a local tragedy), a \u201ccalamity,\u201d a \u201cwound to the nation,\u201d\nand a \u201cday that would never be forgotten.\u201d It was constantly re-affirmed as an\nexceptional grievance, and the signifier \u201c9\/11,\u201d torn from any temporal moor-\nings, was immediately iconicised as the foremost symbol of American suffer-\ning. That is, by funneling the experience through the image of American\nexceptionalism while simultaneously claiming that the exceptional nature of\nthe event placed it outside of normal political discourse, \u201c9\/11 quickly took on\nan exceptional ahistoricity.\u201d8 None of this is to deny that it was genuine trag-\nedy, but as any political entrepreneur knows, group grievance, national suffer-\ning and a sense of communal victim-hood provides one of the most potent\nmeans for legitimizing retaliatory counter-violence. There is little doubt that\nAmerica\u2019s status of victim has since been effectively employed as a means of\nlegitimizing military counter-violence and silencing opposition. As Donald\nRumsfeld stated in response to a question about civilian casualties during\nbombing operations in Afghanistan: \u201cThere are going to be loss of life\u2014there\nalready have been. It started on September 11th in this building.\u201d9 Crucial to\nthe maintenance of America\u2019s exceptional status as the primary victim was\nthe decision by the television networks to avoid showing pictures of any\nbombed Afghan civilians.\nA second, and perhaps the most important discursive sleight of hand in\nthe construction of the attacks was its transformation from \u201cdespicable acts of\nterror\u201d10 as Bush called it on September 11, 2001, to their rhetorical rebirth as\nan \u201cact of war\u201c in the following days.11 Such a rendering was central to placing\nSecurity, Democracy 151\nit in an understandable \u201cgood war\u201d narrative, and to justifying a war-based,\nrather than a criminal justice-based, counter-terrorist response. Of course, it\nwould have been equally possible to re-affirm the attacks as terrorist assaults\nby a sub-state group of violent dissidents, criminal acts of mass murder, and\ncrimes against humanity. Re-constructing them primarily as an \u201cact of war\u201d\nhowever, conferred on the state powers reserved for the supreme emergency,\nas well as domestic and international justification for military-based self-\ndefense.\nA third aspect of the construction of the attacks was their discursive inser-\ntion into popular historical-political meta-narratives. De-coupled from their\norigins in the messy politics of the Middle East and the dark machinations of\nAmerican foreign policy in Afghanistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, and\nshorn from the history of a deepening spiral of violence and counter-violence\nbetween al Qaeda and American forces that had been ongoing since 1991, the\nattacks were reconstituted in terms more familiar and understandable to the\nAmerican public. Very early on, the attacks were re-made in the mode of a\nWorld War II movie: they were \u201cjust like Pearl Harbor\u201d (\u201cSeptember 11 was\nPearl Harbor\u201d according to one Congressman12), and the attackers were fas-\ncists and totalitarians akin to the Fascist Axis Powers. In a highly ironic\ntwist, another World War II reference, \u201cGround Zero,\u201d was re-made as the site\nand symbol of America\u2019s victim-hood; no longer was it the place of ultimate\nJapanese suffering and American atrocity, it had now been reconstituted as a\nsolely American narrative. In this usage, the term \u201cground zero,\u201d relies on an\nhistorical analogy which cannot be openly acknowledged because it would,\namong other things, destabilize the precariously established status of the\nUnited States as the primary victim. In other words, the term \u201cboth evokes\nand eclipses the prior historical reference, using it as a yardstick of terror\u2014to\nclaim that this was just like the horrific experience of a nuclear bomb\u2014while\nat the same time consigning the prior reference to historical amnesia.\u201d13 These\ndiscursive renderings made the attacks instantly understandable to a public\nimmersed in the \u201cgood war\u201d mythology of the Second World War, popularized\nover decades of movies and television programs such as From Here to Eternity,\nThirty Seconds Over Tokyo, Patton, Schindler\u2019s List, Saving Private Ryan,\nBand of Brothers, U-571 and the blockbuster of 2001, Pearl Harbor.14\nRelated to this primary constitutive narrative of American identity, the\nattacks were also re-made as symbolic of the eternal struggle between the\nforces of \u201cbarbarism\u201d and \u201ccivilization.\u201d The attacks of \u201c9\u201311,\u201d as administra-\ntion officials constructed them, drew a line between the \u201cthe civil and the sav-\nage,\u201d15 between civilized people and the terrorists that \u201clive on the hunted\nmargins of mankind,\u201d16 and between terrorism\u2019s values and the \u201cvalues that\nseparate us from animals\u2014compassion, tolerance, mercy.\u201d17 This meta-narrative\nactually has a long genealogy in international relations,18 which can be seen\nmost recently in the so-called \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d discourse.19 In both popular\n152 R. Jackson\nculture and counter-terrorism discourse, terrorists are \u201cthe new barbarians,\u201d\nthe epitome of savagery for the Western psyche.20 Linguistically, this trope is\nachieved through the natural functioning of the binary structure of language\nitself: employing the concept \u201ccivilization\u201d instinctively brings to mind the\nopposite concept, \u201cbarbarism.\u201d\nIn its textual usage in political and social conversation, the civilization-\nbarbarism dichotomy has a number of different layers of meaning. For exam-\nple, on one level it evokes images of menacing nomadic armies attempting to\nconquer Christian Europe. In the context of today\u2019s terrorists, it implies that\n\u201cthe behavior of these new \u2018barbarians\u2019 is uncontrollably guided by the same\ncruel instincts that motivated some of the most infamous \u2018barbarians\u2019 of past\ncenturies, including Attila the Hun and the Mongol leader Genghis Khan.\u201d21\nOn another level, the civilization narrative is, for Americans at least, embed-\nded into its foundational myths:\nThe myth represents American history as an Indian war, in which white\nChristian civilization is opposed by a \u201csavage\u201d racial enemy: an enemy whose\nhostility to civilization is part of its nature or fundamental character, an enemy\nwho is not just opposed to our interests but to \u201ccivilization itself\u201d[ . . . ].22\nIn Freudian terms, we might say that the barbarians are representative of the\nid force: libidinous, irrational, violent, and dangerous. And at another but\nrelated level, the civilized Western world is contrasted with the violent and\nbarbaric Eastern world. According to Said, it is a function of the way that our\nidentity has been constructed; the Western person only exists as a contrast\nwith the \u201cOriental\u201d Other.23 In yet another language layer, globalization has\ncome to be seen as the late-modern, sociological term for the \u201ccivilizing pro-\ncess.\u201d In this respect, terrorism\u2014as a form of barbarism\u2014can be seen as a\nchallenge to international order and the civilizing process of globalization.24\nActually, the globalization meta-narrative is not so opaque; the events of\nSeptember 11, 2001 are deliberately re-constructed as an attack on the global\neconomic system. In his speech to the CEO Summit in Shanghai, emboldened\nby his proximity to the Great Wall of China (built to keep barbarians at bay),\nBush states:\nThe stakes of this fight for all nations are high\u2014our lives, our way of life,\nand our economic future. By attacking two great economic symbols, the terrorists\ntried to shatter confidence in the world economic system. [ . . . ] Terrorists want\nto turn the openness of the global economy against itself. We must not let them.25\nAlan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, makes the discursive link\neven clearer. According to him, \u201cTerrorism poses a challenge to the remark-\nable record of globalization\u201d; moreover, \u201cif we allow terrorism to undermine\nour freedom of action, we could reverse at least part of the palpable gains\nachieved by postwar globalization.\u201d26 In other words, \u201c9\/11\u201d was an act of\nSecurity, Democracy 153\nanti-globalization, as well as an act of war. It was \u201cthe battle of Seattle\u201d in\nNew York. This new layer of meaning helps to fill the void of meaning about\nthe events with yet another contemporary and politically driven narrative.\nIn short, from an almost infinite universe of potential interpretations and\nmeanings that could have been employed (a unique criminal conspiracy, a\ncrime against humanity, \u201cblowback\u201d from earlier American policies, the latest\nphase of state-dissident violence and counter-violence, to suggest a few possi-\nbilities), through the careful use of key narratives and rhetorical strategies,\nthe events of September 11, 2001 came to signify an extremely narrow set of\npolitical \u201ctruths\u201d: America had been attacked in an act of war by barbarians\nwho were set on destroying America, globalization, and civilization itself; it\nwas the start of a new, but familiar kind of war, in which America would fight\nnew, but proverbial enemies.\nConstructing identities: evil terrorists and good Americans\nThe realm of foreign policy, and particularly foreign adversaries, is enor-\nmously significant for \u201cwriting\u201d identities.27 Foreign policy is critical for main-\ntaining internal\/external boundaries, and war (as a special form of foreign\npolicy) plays a central role in maintaining the domains of inside\/outside, foreign\/\ndomestic, self\/other. This is no less true for the \u201cwar on terrorism,\u201d which as\nwe have suggested, is constructed largely in an epideictic rhetorical mode,\nrather than a deliberative mode.28 Bush makes appeals that attempt to unify\nthe community and amplify its virtues; national character rather than\nnational deliberation determine its actions. In fact, it has been argued that\nthe very concept of the political self is based on the identification of the\n\u201cenemy\u201d; in other words, the enemy terrorist in the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d acts as\nthe \u201cenabling other\u201d of the state\u2014its negative justification.29 More than just\nidentity maintenance then, the discourse of self and other in the rhetoric of\ncounter-terrorism co-constitutes the political; it permits the state as practice.\nPerhaps the most important feature of the construction of identity in this\ndiscourse is the ubiquitous use of a rhetorical trope of \u201cgood and evil.\u201d Deeply\nembedded in American rhetorical traditions and religious life (as well as being\na sub-plot of the \u201ccivilization-barbarism\u201d meta-narrative), this language essen-\ntializes the terrorists as both satanic and morally corrupt. On September 11,\nBush stated that \u201cToday, our nation saw evil, the very worst of human\nnature\u201d;30 in subsequent texts, he frequently refers to terrorists as \u201cthe evil\nones,\u201d and \u201cevildoers.\u201d These are theological terms, deployed largely for a\nSouthern conservative audience, but also appealing to popular entertainment\nunderstandings of \u201cgood guys\u201d and \u201cbad guys.\u201d As such, it is a demonological\nmove in which the terrorists are individually and collectively marked as\n\u201ccruel,\u201d \u201cmad\u201d, and driven by \u201chate\u201d; perhaps inadvertently, it also supernatu-\nralizes them. In this agent\/act ratio, the character of the terrorists precedes\n154 R. Jackson\ntheir actions: the terrorists did what they did because it is in their nature to\ndo so\u2014they murdered because that is what evil, demonic terrorists do.31 It is a\npowerful discourse, and an act of demagoguery, which de-contextualizes and\nde-historicizes the actions of the terrorists, emptying them of any political\ncontent, while simultaneously de-humanizing them. After all, there can be no\ndeeper explanation for such acts, and there can be no reasoning or compromis-\ning with evil; the only right response is exorcism and purification. At the same\ntime, the radical evil argument32 is a long used strategy of silencing liberal\ndissent: from Leo Strauss and Reinhold Neibuhr to Ronald Reagan, liberals\nhave been charged with lacking both a realistic sense of human evil and the\nmoral courage to confront it.\nIn an extension of re-making the attackers as demons, they are also\nscripted as inhuman or non-human. Bush speaks of the \u201ccurse of terrorism that\nis upon the face of the earth,\u201d33 while Colin Powell refers to \u201cthe scourge of ter-\nrorism.\u201d34 This medical metaphor is restated more explicitly by Rumsfeld: \u201cWe\nshare the belief that terrorism is a cancer on the human condition.\u201d35 Bush in\nturn, speaks of the danger to the body politic posed by \u201cterrorist parasites who\nthreaten their countries and our own.\u201d36 In this construction, the terrorist is re-\nmade as a dangerous organism that makes its host ill; they hide interiorly,\ndrawing on the lifeblood of their unsuspecting hosts and spreading poison. This\nparticular language is actually a precursor to the disciplinary idea of \u201cthe\nenemy within\u201d; they are the new \u201creds under the bed.\u201d Of course, such \u201can evil\nand inhuman group of men\u201d37\u2014these \u201cfaceless enemies of human dignity\u201d38\u2014\nare undeserving of our sympathy or protection. While it would be wrong to\ntreat an enemy soldier inhumanely, or torture a criminal suspect, the same\ncannot be said for a parasite, a cancer, a curse. If the enemy is removed from\nthe moral realm of human community, then by extension, actions towards\nthem cannot be judged on moral terms. This is extremely liberating for a gov-\nernment fighting a hidden enemy, as it means that those government agencies\nthat practice the \u201cblack arts\u201d can be unleashed with impunity.\nHowever, as if it were not enough to strip the enemy of all human fea-\ntures, the discourse also goes on to write them as fundamentally \u201calien\u201d and\n\u201cforeign.\u201d As John Ashcroft states:\nToday I\u2019m announcing several steps that we\u2019re taking to enhance our ability\nto protect the United States from the threat of terrorist aliens. [ . . . ] The Foreign\nTerrorist Tracking Task Force that Mr. McCraw will lead will ensure that federal\nagencies coordinate their efforts to bar from the United States all aliens who\nmeet any of the following criteria: aliens who are representatives, members or\nsupporters of terrorist organizations; aliens who are suspected of engaging in ter-\nrorist activity; or aliens who provide material support to terrorist activity.39\nThis designation of \u201calien terrorists\u201d in particular, is the ultimate expression of\n\u201cotherness\u201d and is designed to clearly demarcate the boundaries between the\nSecurity, Democracy 155\ninside and the outside, between those who belong to the community and those\noutside of it. In other words, not only are the terrorists disqualified from the\ndomain of our community, they are disqualified from humanity itself. In a\nsociety immersed in the movie mythology of Invasion of the Body Snatchers,\nAlien, Independence Day, and The X-Files, the meanings of the term \u201calien ter-\nrorist\u201d oscillate between \u201cextra-terrestrial parasite\u201d and \u201cforeign enemy\u201d with-\nout a hint of irony. After all, alien invasion movies are cultural metaphors for\nthe fear of foreign invasion. Anthropologically, the trope of the evil\/cancerous\/\nalien terrorist \u201cmonster\u201d\u2014the mode of composing social relations among\nterms\u2014is actually the cultural projection of the tabooed \u201cwild man\u201d figure of\nthe Western imagination.40 That is, rooted in the fundamental need to control\ndangerous behavior, taboos function to locate, identify, and segregate trans-\ngressions and dangers. In the absence of the (old) barbarians and the \u201cred\nmenace,\u201d terrorism now fulfills these functions to a tee.\nOn the other side of the identity coin, Americans are simultaneously con-\nstructed as being the polar opposite of the terrorist nature. The first major dis-\ncursive inscription of the American character comes early on at the Prayer\nand Remembrance Day service on September 14, 2001. At this symbolically\ncharged and constitutive pageant, Bush says:\nIn this trial, we have been reminded, and the world has seen, that our fellow\nAmericans are generous and kind, resourceful and brave. We see our national\ncharacter in rescuers working past exhaustion; in long lines of blood donors; in\nthousands of citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible. And\nwe have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice. [ . . . ] In these\nacts, and in many others, Americans showed a deep commitment to one another,\nand an abiding love for our country. Today, we feel what Franklin Roosevelt\ncalled the warm courage of national unity. This is a unity of every faith, and\nevery background.41\nIn other words, Bush is constructing a new world of clearly demarcated char-\nacters: where terrorists are cruel, \u201cthe American people\u201d are generous and\nkind; where terrorists are hateful, Americans are loving; where terrorists are\ncowardly, Americans are brave and heroic; and where terrorists hide and run,\nAmericans are united. This highlighting and amplification is necessary to\ninscribe the essential qualities of insiders and outsiders, and plays through a\nmovie-based mode of the simple opposites of \u201cgood guys and bad guys.\u201d\nAnother ubiquitous motif in the discourse is the \u2018hero\u2019 narrative, which\nagain, is modelled on popular entertainment scripts. Every story in American\npopular culture has a cast of heroes and villains. The \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d is no\ndifferent: every EMS worker is Bruce Willis in Die Hard; every member of the\narmed forces is Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan; every ordinary citizen is\nMel Gibson in The Patriot. Rumsfeld, in a memorial service the Pentagon vic-\ntims, constructs these all-American heroes:\n156 R. Jackson\nWe remember them as heroes. And we are right to do so. [ . . . ] \u201cHe was a\nhero long before the eleventh of September,\u201d said a friend of one of those we have\nlost\u2014\u201ca hero every single day, a hero to his family, to his friends and to his pro-\nfessional peers.\u201d [ . . . ] About him and those who served with him, his wife said:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just when a plane hits their building. They are heroes every day.\u201d\n\u201cHeroes every day.\u201d We are here to affirm that.42\nIn one sense, this is simply national therapy\u2014a way of giving meaning and\nrespect to the lives lost. However, in its discursive function, it is also the\ninscription of the heroic Americans who are the opposite of the cowardly ter-\nrorists; it is the rendering of America\u2019s soldiers who are risking their lives to\nfight for the Homeland, freedom, and the safety of decent folk. Elevation to the\nstatus of hero is more than just leading by example, however; heroes are above\ncriticism or moral judgment. Heroes are free to act as they see fit, even if it\nsometimes involves crossing the lines of public morality, and their shortcom-\nings are quickly forgiven because by definition their motives are honest.\nIn summary, destroying the face of the terrorist, removing all traces of\ntheir personality or humanity, is essential to constructing the massive\ncounter-violence of the \u201cwar on terrorism.\u201d After all, it would be far more dif-\nficult to bomb, torture, or hold in prison camps \u201cenemy combatants\u201d that\nwere simply misguided, or psychologically ill, or commonly criminal. Simul-\ntaneously, the scripting of Americans as essentially \u201cgood\u201d (and heroic,\npeaceful, innocent) is a means of reassurance: whatever Americans do is\ngood and right, because it is their nature to be good\u2014even if on the face of it,\nthe victims of September 11, 2001 look strikingly similar to the victims of\nOctober 7, 2001.\nConstructing threat and danger\nAs David Campbell has shown, discourses of danger and foreign threat\nhave been integral in constituting and disciplining American identity as prac-\nticed through its foreign policy.43 Collectivities, especially those as disparate\nand diverse as America, are often only unified by an external threat or danger;\nin this sense, threat creation can be functional to political life. Historically,\nthe American government has relied on the discourse of threat and danger on\nnumerous occasions: the \u201cred scares\u201d of the native Americans who threatened\nthe spread of peaceful civilization along the Western frontier, the workers\u2019\nunrest at the time of the Bolshevik Revolution, and the threat to the American\nway of life during the cold war; the threat of \u201crogue states\u201d like Libya, Panama,\nIran, North Korea, and Iraq; and the threats posed by the drug trade, the pro-\nliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and now of course, terrorism. These\ndiscourses of danger are scripted for the purposes of maintaining inside\/\noutside, self\/other boundaries\u2014they write American identity\u2014and for enforc-\ning unity on an unruly and (dis)United States.\nSecurity, Democracy 157\nOf course, there are other more mundane political functions for constructing\nfear and moral panic: provoking and allaying anxiety to maintain quiescence,\nde-legitimizing dissent, elevating the status of security actors, diverting scarce\nresources into ideologically driven political projects, distracting the public from\nmore complex and pressing social ills.44 This is not to say that terrorism poses\nno real threat; the dangers can plainly be seen in the images of falling bodies\nand the piles of rubble. Rather, it is to point out that dangers are those facets of\nsocial life interpreted as threats (in one sense, dangers do not exist objectively,\nindependent of perception), and what is interpreted as posing a threat may not\nalways correspond to the realities of the actual risk of harm. Illegal narcotics,\nfor example, pose less of a risk than the abuse of legal drugs, but a \u201cwar on\ndrugs\u201d makes it otherwise. Similarly, the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d is a multi-billion\ndollar exercise to protect Americans from a danger that, excluding the Septem-\nber 11, 2001 attacks, killed less people per year over several decades than bee\nstings and lightening strikes. Even in 2001, America\u2019s worst year of terrorist\ndeaths, the casualties from terrorism were still vastly outnumbered by deaths\nfrom auto-related accidents, gun crimes, alcohol and tobacco-related illnesses,\nsuicides, and a large number of diseases like influenza, cancer, and heart dis-\nease. Globally, terrorism, which kills a few thousand per year, pales into insig-\nnificance next to the 40,000 people who die every day from hunger, the half a\nmillion people who die every year from small wars, the 150,000 annual deaths\nfrom increased diseases caused by global warming,45 and the millions who die\nfrom AIDS. And yet, the whole world is caught up in the global \u201cwar on terror-\nism\u201d whose costs so far run into the hundreds of billions. In a world of multiple\nthreats, many of which pose a far greater risk to individual safety, the fact that\nterrorism is widely seen as posing the greatest and most immediate threat is\ndue to the deliberate construction of a discourse of danger.\nThe initial construction of the threat of terrorism involved fixing the\nattacks of 9\/11 as the start of a whole new \u201cage of terror,\u201d rather than as an\nextraordinary event, or an aberration (out of 18,000 terrorist attacks since\n1968 only a dozen or so have caused more than 100 deaths; high-casualty ter-\nrorist attacks are extremely rare and 9\/11 was the rarest of the rare). Instead,\nthe attacks were interpreted as the dawning of a new era of terrorist violence\nthat knew no bounds. As Bush stated, \u201cAll of this was brought upon us in a\nsingle day\u2014and night fell on a different world.\u201d46 Vice-President Dick Cheney\nmade it even clearer:\nToday, we are not just looking at a new era in national security policy, we are\nactually living through it. The exact nature of the new dangers revealed them-\nselves on September 11, 2001, with the murder of 3,000 innocent, unsuspecting\nmen, women, and children right here at home.47\nThis construct was only possible by severing all links between this act of ter-\nrorism and countless others that had preceded it, and by de-contextualizing it\n158 R. Jackson\nfrom the history of al Qaeda\u2019s previous attacks. As we saw earlier, \u201c9\/11\u201d was\nconstructed without a pre-history; it stands alone as a defining act of cruelty\nand evil. This break with the past makes it possible to assign it future\nsignificance as the start of \u201csuper-terrorism,\u201d \u201ccatastrophic terrorism,\u201d or sim-\nply \u201cthe new terrorism.\u201d Logically, if there\u2019s a new super-terrorism, then a\nnew super-war-on-terrorism seems reasonable.\nA second feature of this discourse of danger is the hyperbolic language of\nthreat. It is not just a threat of sudden violent death, it is actually a \u201cthreat to\ncivilization,\u201d a \u201cthreat to the very essence of what you do,\u201d48 a \u201cthreat to our way\nof life,\u201d49 and a threat to \u201cthe peace of the world.\u201d50 The notion of a \u201cthreat to our\nway of life\u201d is a Cold War expression that vastly inflates the danger: instead of a\ntiny group of dissidents with resources that do not even begin to rival that of the\nsmallest states, it implies that they are as powerful as the Soviet empire was\nonce thought to be with its tens of thousands of missiles and its massive conven-\ntional army. Moreover, as Cheney reminds us, the threat of terrorism, like the\nthreat of Soviet nuclear weapons, is supremely catastrophic:\nThe attack on our country forced us to come to grips with the possibility that\nthe next time terrorists strike, they may well be armed with more than just plane\ntickets and box cutters. The next time they might direct chemical agents or diseases\nat our population, or attempt to detonate a nuclear weapon in one of our cities. [ . . .\n] no rational person can doubt that terrorists would use such weapons of mass mur-\nder the moment they are able to do so. [ . . . ] we are dealing with terrorists [ . . . ]\nwho are willing to sacrifice their own lives in order to kill millions of others.51\nIn other words, not only are we threatened by evil terrorists eager to kill mil-\nlions (not to mention civilization itself, the peace of the world, and the Ameri-\ncan way of life), but this is a rational and reasonable fear to have. We should\nbe afraid, very afraid: \u201cIf they had the capability to kill millions of innocent\ncivilians, do any of us believe they would hesitate to do so?.\u201d52\nAs if this was not enough to spread panic throughout the community, offi-\ncials then go to great lengths to explain how these same terrorists (who are\neager to kill millions of us) are actually highly sophisticated, cunning, and\nextremely dangerous. As John Ashcroft put it: \u201cThe highly coordinated attacks\nof September 11 make it clear that terrorism is the activity of expertly orga-\nnized, highly coordinated, and well\u2013financed organizations and networks.\u201d53\nMoreover, this is not a tiny and isolated group of dissidents, but \u201cthere are\nthousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries\u201d and they \u201chide in\ncountries around the world to plot evil and destruction\u201d;54 or, like the plot of a\npopular novel: \u201cThousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of\nmurder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the\nworld like ticking time bombs, set to go off without warning.\u201d55 In other\nspeeches, officials inflate the numbers of the terrorists to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d\nof killers spread throughout the world.\nSecurity, Democracy 159\nThe next layer of fear is the notion that the threat resides within; that it is\nno longer confined outside the borders of the community, but that it is inside\nof us and all around us. As Ashcroft constructs it:\nThe attacks of September 11 were acts of terrorism against America orches-\ntrated and carried out by individuals living within our borders. Today\u2019s terrorists\nenjoy the benefits of our free society even as they commit themselves to our\ndestruction. They live in our communities\u2014plotting, planning, and waiting to kill\nAmericans again [ . . . ] a conspiracy of evil.56\nLike the \u201cred scares\u201d of the past, the discourse of danger is deployed in this\nmode to enforce social discipline, mute dissent, and increase the powers of the\nnational security state. It is designed to bring the war home, or, as Bush puts\nit: \u201cAnd make no mistake about it, we\u2019ve got a war here just like we\u2019ve got a\nwar abroad.\u201d57\nIn another genealogical link to previous American foreign policy, the\nthreat of terrorism is from a very early stage reflexively conflated with the\nthreat of \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d and the \u201crogue states\u201d who might\nhand them on to terrorists. According to the discourse, rogue states are appar-\nently eager to assist terrorists in killing millions of Americans. As Bush stated\nin his now infamous \u201caxis of evil\u201d speech,\nStates like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming\nto threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these\nregimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to ter-\nrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred.58\nThis is actually an ingenious discursive slight of hand which allows America\nto re-target its military from a war against a tiny group of individual dissi-\ndents scattered across the globe, to territorially defined states who also hap-\npen to be the target of American foreign policy. It transforms the \u201cwar against\nterrorism\u201d from a largely hidden and unspectacular intelligence gathering and\ncriminal apprehension program, to a flag-waving public display of awesome\nmilitary firepower that re-builds a rather dented American self-confidence.\nMore importantly, it allows for the simultaneous pursuit of geo-strategic\nobjectives in crucial regions such as the Middle East under the banner of the\n\u201cwar on terrorism.\u201d59\nInstead of reassuring the nation that the attacks were an exceptional and\na unique event in a long line of terrorist attacks against America (that have\nthus far failed to overthrow freedom), the Bush administration chose instead\nto construct them as the start of a whole new age of terror\u2014the start of a\ndeadly new form of violence directed at Americans, civilized people all over the\nworld, freedom, and democracy. The Bush administration could have chosen\nto publicize the conclusions of the Gilmore Commission in 1999, a Clinton-\nappointed advisory panel on the threat of WMD falling into the hands of\n160 R. Jackson\nterrorists. Its final report concluded that \u201crogue states would hesitate to\nentrust such weapons to terrorists because of the likelihood that such a\ngroup\u2019s actions might be unpredictable even to the point of using the weapon\nagainst its sponsor,\u201d and they would be reluctant to use such weapons them-\nselves due to \u201cthe prospect of significant reprisals.\u201d60 Condoleeza Rice herself\nwrote in 2000 that there was no need to panic about rogue states, because \u201cif\nthey do acquire WMD\u2014their weapons will be unusable because any attempt\nto use them will bring national obliteration.\u201d61 Instead, officials engaged in\nthe deliberate construction of a world of unimaginable dangers and unspeak-\nable threats; they encouraged social fear and moral panic. Within the suffocat-\ning confines of such an emergency, where Americans measure their daily\nsafety by the color of a national terrorist alert scale (reflected in the glow of\nevery traffic light), it seems perfectly reasonable that the entire resources of\nthe state be mobilized in defense of the homeland, and that pre-emptive war\nshould be pursued. It also seems reasonable that national unity be maintained\nand expressions of dissent curtailed.\nThe reality effect of scripting such a powerful danger moreover, can be seen\nin the two major wars fought in two years (followed by costly ongoing \u201csecurity\noperations\u201d in each of those states to root out the terrorists), the arrest of thou-\nsands of suspects in America and around the world, and the vast sums spent\nunquestioningly (even by the Democrats) on domestic security, border control\nand the expansion of the military. Only the \u201creality\u201d of the threat of terrorism\nallows such extravagance; in fact, the manner in which the threat has been con-\nstructed\u2014catastrophic, ubiquitous, and ongoing\u2014normalizes the entire effort.\nIf an alternative interpretation of the threat emerged to challenge the dominant\northodoxy (that it was vastly over-blown, or misdirected, for example), support\nfor the consumption of such massive amounts of resources might be questioned\nand the political order destabilized. A massive threat of terrorism then, is neces-\nsary for the continued viability of the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d; writing the threat of\nterrorism is co-constitutive of the practice of counter-terrorism.\nConstructing the \u201cgood war\u201d\nBy this stage, the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d has already been powerfully con-\nstructed as the quintessential good war:62 apart from its conflation with the\n\u201cgood war\u201d meta-narratives of World War II, the Cold War and the battle for\ncivilization, it is also continuously reproduced as a Manichean struggle\nbetween good and evil, and a rational response to the extreme dangers posed\nby terrorism. However, in a \u201ctheo-political\u201d atmosphere,63 where a fundamen-\ntalist Christian president speaks to nineteen million Christian Right voters\n(the single most influential voting bloc in America), a \u201cgood war\u201d is not nearly\nenough\u2014it must also be a divinely sanctioned war. Tapping into the deep\nwell-spring of American religiosity as a means of solidifying support, the \u201cwar\nSecurity, Democracy 161\non terrorism\u201d is given God\u2019s blessing by its careful construction as a tradi-\ntional Just War. That is, officials construct the war as having a just cause, as\nbeing properly conducted, as being a last resort, and as being winnable.\nIn the first place, the war is re-molded from a counter-terrorist operation to\na Just War with a clear casus belli, namely, bringing the perpetrators to \u201cjus-\ntice.\u201d As Bush nonsensically expressed it, \u201cWhether we bring our enemies to\njustice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.\u201d64 On one level, this\nconflates America\u2019s actions with the divine purpose. In the same speech, Bush\nstated: \u201cFreedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and\nwe know that God is not neutral between them.\u201d65 In other words, God is on the\nside of \u201cjustice\u201d; America is bringing \u201cjustice\u201d; therefore, by definition, God is\non America\u2019s side. In part, it is this assertion of universal values and divine\ncalling that led the Bush administration to initially call the Afghan campaign\n\u201cInfinite Justice\u201d; more than simply a slip of the tongue, as it was later\nclaimed, it was the logical choice for the construction of a Just War. On another\nlevel, framed in the language of the American frontier (note the use of Wanted\nDead or Alive posters and bounties, the \u201cMost Wanted Terrorists\u201d featured on\nthe popular television program America\u2019s Most Wanted, and Bush\u2019s cowboy\nboots), the campaign in Afghanistan to \u201csmoke them out of their holes\u201d66 fits\neasily into America\u2019s rich mythology of redemptive violence; it is Shane, John\nWayne, or Clint Eastwood exacting revenge, enforcing a kind of natural justice\nand ridding the West of dangerous villains so that decent folk can rest safe.\nIn addition to bringing justice, the war\u2019s just cause is reaffirmed by its sta-\ntus as a war of self-defense. This is the traditional means by which states\nassert their right to wage war; wars of aggression are by definition wrong, but\nwars of self-defense are fully justified. As Under Secretary of State Marc\nGrossman, constructed it:\nI believe that Security Council resolution 1368 that was passed on the 12th\nof September, offers all of the legal basis and requirement that we need, in addi-\ntion to Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which is the right of self-defense.\nAnd we believe the United States was attacked on the 11th of September and\nthat we have a right of self-defense in this regard.67\nRumsfeld repeats this construction by appealing to the universal right of\nevery nation to self-defense: \u201cthere is no question but that any nation on earth\nhas the right of self-defense. And we do.\u201d68 In other words, it is a Just War\nbecause it is legally sanctioned by the authority of international law. Impor-\ntantly, the choice of legal arguments for attacking Afghanistan was in itself\nhighly strategic: going for UN legal justification in terms of self-defense rather\nthan Chapter VII action provided a greater freedom to maneuver and avoided\nexisting and constraining precedents.69 In either case, both of these reasons\u2014\nbringing justice or self-defense\u2014qualify as acceptable reasons for war accord-\ning to traditional Just War Theory.\n162 R. Jackson\nIn addition to the construction of its just cause, the war on terrorism is\nframed in the language of Just War Theory by its claims to be properly con-\nducted, with proportionality and due care for the lives of innocent civilians. As\nAmerican officials constantly reiterated:\nI know for a fact that we are just being enormously careful. We are doing\neverything humanly possible to try to avoid collateral damage.70\nAfghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and\nspare innocent lives, and we need more of them.71\nObviously, a war that does not just take care to try and avoid civilian casual-\nties but actually saves innocent lives is a rightly conducted war. Grossman\nactually puts the case positively: \u201cI believe, sir, that when there is a fair and\naccurate representation when this campaign is over, we will find that the\nnumber of civilian casualties actually has been very, very low.\u201d72 Rumsfeld\ngoes even further: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s been a conflict in history where\nthere has been less collateral damage, less unintended consequences.\u201d73 In\nother words, the whole debate over the conduct of the war is moot because so\nfew civilians will be, or have been killed; a war with so few civilian deaths\nmakes it a truly Just War\u2014perhaps it is the first truly Just War in history.\nJust War Theory also states that wars should only be undertaken as a last\nresort after all other avenues have been explored. It is thus a prominent fea-\nture of the discourse that there is no peaceful alternative to a \u201cwar on terror-\nism.\u201d As Bush put it: \u201cthe only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way\nof life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows\u201d;74 and \u201cIn the\nface of today\u2019s new threat, the only way to pursue peace is to pursue those who\nthreaten it.\u201d75 Moreover, unlike previous enemies (or perhaps like previous\nenemies), \u201cThose who hate all civilization and culture and progress, those who\nembrace death to cause the death of the innocent, cannot be ignored, cannot be\nappeased. They must be fought.\u201d76 This is an oblique World War II reference\nto the appeasement of Hitler; its meaning is simply that there can be no\npeaceful solution when facing such enemies. War is the only resort, much less\nthe last resort. Such a rendering places the justifications for the war firmly\nwithin the precepts of Just War Theory.\nAnother Just War precept is that any war undertaken must have a reason-\nable chance of success in order to minimize suffering. From the very beginning,\nthe \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d was discursively constructed as ultimately winnable.\nBush stated on September 11, 2001, \u201cwe stand together to win the war against\nterrorism.\u201d77 In addressing the final outcome of the war, the grammatical form\nis always unequivocally a statement of fact rather than opinion: \u201cwe will win\nthis conflict by the patient accumulation of successes\u201d;78 \u201cWe will fight for as\nlong as it takes, and we will prevail\u201d;79 \u201cAnd on the home front, terrorist vio-\nlence must be prevented, and must be defeated. And it will be.\u201d80 In fact, when\nasked about the length of the war\u2014a direct reference to the chances of winning in\nSecurity, Democracy 163\na reasonable period of time\u2014Bush replied: \u201cPeople often ask me, how long will\nthis last? This particular battlefront will last as long as it takes to bring al Qaeda\nto justice. It may happen a month from now; it may take a year or two. But we\nwill prevail.\u201d81 There is no question about the outcome, even if the timeframe is a\nlittle vague. In this case, the certainty of victory rhetorically overwhelms the\nuncertainty over the length of the campaign; the end result\u2014triumph\u2014is more\nimportant than the time it takes to get there.\nHowever, in the end, the \u201cgood war\u201d on terrorism falls victim to its inbuilt\ncontradictions and has to be reflexively reconstituted as a \u201cnew kind of war\u201d; it\nbecomes instead a \u201cgood new war.\u201d As Bush constructs it, \u201cthe world has come\ntogether to fight a new and different war, the first, and we hope the only one of\nthe 21st century.\u201d82 In the same speech, he argues that \u201cThis is a different kind\nof war that requires a different type of approach and different type of mental-\nity.\u201d This re-writing is necessary because a Just War, properly constituted and\nconducted, requires adherence to the laws of war\u2014the proper treatment of\ncaptured enemy soldiers, defensible grounds for attacking weaker nations,\nand proper sanction by the governing institutions of international society.\nIn this, it also requires recognition of the enemy as legitimate purveyors of\nviolence\u2014as warriors rather than as demons or barbarians. Such a descriptor\nobviously does not sit comfortably with the notion of evil and inhuman terror-\nists. Thus, the war on terrorism had to be re-written as a \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d\nwar, one with new kinds of enemies\u2014\u201cunlawful combatants\u201d\u2014who could be\nsubjected to treatment prohibited to legitimate warriors and soldiers (indefi-\nnite internment, subject to torture \u201clite\u201d, trial by military courts, extradited to\ncountries without prohibitions on the use of torture, and so on). In this con-\ntext, Bush explains his creation of a new legal category:\nI have also reserved the option of trial by military commission of foreign ter-\nrorists who wage war against our country. Non-citizens, non-U.S. citizens who\nplan and\/or commit mass murder are more than criminal suspects. They are\nunlawful combatants who seek to destroy our country and our way of life. And if I\ndetermine that it is in the national security interest of our great land to try by\nmilitary commission those who make war on America, then we will do so.83\nIn other words, within the textual world of the \u201cnew\u201d war on terrorism, the con-\ntradictions involved in denying enemy soldiers any rights under the Geneva\nConventions or the criminal justice system are reconciled. It is a powerful rhe-\ntorical strategy that can be reflexively and retroactively employed to justify\nand explain almost any unsavory aspect of this \u201cgood war\u201d that comes to light.\nMore than simply the treatment of prisoners then, this construction provides\npolicy-makers with a great deal of flexibility in dealing with any inherent ten-\nsions of the discourse: whatever does not fit the traditional conception of the\n\u201cgood war\u201d can be explained away as a necessity of the \u201cdifferent kind of war\u201d\nnow being fought. This is how indefinite detention and the suspension of\n164 R. Jackson\nhabeas corpus, black operations and assassinations on foreign soil, the massa-\ncre of Taliban prisoners in Afghanistan, providing material and political sup-\nport to abusive authoritarian regimes, using Watergate-style dirty tricks on\nSecurity Council members, and other morally suspect methods, are rhetori-\ncally washed clean and baptized into the good and just \u201cwar on terrorism.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nThere are a number of significant and interesting aspects to this discourse.\nObviously, it is an extremely powerful discourse that has normalized a partic-\nular approach to counter-terrorism which is for the most part, uncritically\naccepted and unquestioned except in its application. Even the opposition\nDemocrats do not question the necessity of a \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d; rather, their\nmain concern is whether attacking Iraq was the right strategy at the time.\nThe current ideological hegemony of the discourse is aided by its relatively\nunmediated reproduction in the American media (and parts of the global\nmedia), and by its almost verbatim reproduction by the leaders of coalition\npartners, such as Blair and Howard. In fact, the media has been highly com-\nplicit in the reproduction of the discourse; even the most uncritical appraisal of\nopinion polls reveals how successful it has been in promoting support for\ncounter-terrorism, the linking of 9\u201311 and the Iraqi \u201crogue state,\u201d the constant\nfear of attack, and consequently, the exercise of American military power.\nAdditionally, the genealogy of the current \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d demon-\nstrates clear lines of continuity with the earlier \u201cwars on terrorism\u201d declared\nby the Reagan and Clinton administrations. Following on from each other,\nboth leaders constructed terrorism as the greatest threat to American and\ninternational security, and both attacked \u201crogue states\u201d in the Middle East as\na response: Libya in Reagan\u2019s \u201cwar on terrorism,\u201d Sudan and Afghanistan in\nClinton\u2019s. Now of course, Bush has followed suit in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nReagan, like Bush, referred to \u201cthe evil scourge of terrorism\u201d which was a\nplague spread by the \u201cdepraved opponents of civilization itself\u201d; Secretary of\nState, George Shultz, said that terrorism was \u201ca return to barbarism in the\nmodern age.\u201d84 Far from unique then, the discourse of the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d\nfollows long established interpretive dispositions towards the international\nsphere: a zero-sum attitude towards international action, a tendency to milita-\nrize foreign policy responses, a fear of internal subversion, and a sense of\nendangerment towards \u201cthe other.\u201d85 In other words, part of the reason why\nthe discourse has been so uncritically accepted (particularly domestically) is\nbecause it is built on the logic of previous American responses to similar cri-\nses. Related to this, the discourse is noteworthy for its hybridity, and the ease\nwith which it weaves disparate narratives into a single seamless story of the\ngood fight against terrorism\/barbarism\/evil. The language powerfully com-\nbines World War II, Civilization Versus Barbarism, Good Versus Evil, and\nSecurity, Democracy 165\nJust War narratives into a new super-narrative\u2014a textual symphony\u2014that\nlegitimizes and normalizes the practice of American domestic and foreign pol-\nicy. These powerful discursive combinations provide the authorities with mul-\ntiple possibilities for disciplining subjects, allies, and enemies.\nIn terms of its rhetorical strategies, tropes and modes, the discourse is\nnoted for its reliance on an epideictic presidential style, its popular narratives\nand its overall movie-like script. In this screenplay, familiar entertainment\nthemes are deployed for political effect: the myth of redemptive (Western-\nstyle) violence and popular hero narratives (the EMS and \u201ceveryman\u201d heroes\nof 9\u201311, the heroic armed forces, Saving Private Jessica Lynch) are played out\nin war movie narrative structure by a compliant media (on CNN screens, the\nbanners told the story of \u201cAmerica under Attack,\u201d \u201cAmerica Strikes Back,\u201d\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s New War\u201d and \u201cAmerica Recovers\u201d). The use of these tropes in pub-\nlic discourse taps into a whole reservoir of cultural forms and meanings that\nprovide political resources that are unavailable within the normal liberal-\ndemocratic vocabulary.86 The power of the ubiquitous epideictic rhetoric\ntherefore, is that it creates a new epistemic and symbolic world that provides\nthe backdrop of values, beliefs and identities against which and through\nwhich officials make policy and act politically.87\nHowever, the discourse is also distinguished by its inherent instabilities,\nand the reflexivity required to maintain internal coherence: it is a war, but not\na war like any other ever fought; it is fundamentally about protecting free-\ndom, except for those suspected of terrorist activities; it is to preemptively\ndeal with \u201cimmanent\u201d threats like Iraq, or maybe only \u201cpotential\u201d threats (like\nIraq); it is an historic calling to spread the values of democracy and freedom,\nexcept for those states strategically important in fighting terrorism (such as\nSaudi Arabia, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Russia); it is a good war except when bad\nmethods have to be employed because it is a new war; and so on. In other\nwords, the discourse is not invulnerable and counter-hegemonic struggle is\npossible through a strategy of deconstruction and attacking its inconsistencies\nand contradictions.\nOf course, it is not enough to simply observe the way language and mean-\ning is produced, deployed, used, and misused in public discourse; there are\nalso very real dangers involved that must be acknowledged and addressed.\nFor example, there is a real danger that the discourse relies on an approach to\ncounter-terrorism that has historically proved to be of limited effectiveness,\nand through the privileging of some forms of knowledge over others, excludes\nother potentially more effective counter-terrorist strategies; in short, the risk\nis that the moral absolutism of the discourse induces political amnesia.88\nRelated to this, there is a danger that the discourse is actually misconceiving\nand misunderstanding the nature of the threat\u2014that it is poor \u201cthreat assess-\nment,\u201d to use military parlance. By failing to understand the history and con-\ntext of terrorism, the actual nature and causes of terrorism, and the real\n166 R. Jackson\nmotivations and aims of the terrorists (who are most certainly not sacrificing\ntheir lives in suicidal attacks simply for the sake of \u201cevil\u201d), we may seriously\ndamage the search for more effective and long-term policy solutions. More-\nover, the hegemony of the current discourse may mark out the meaning and\nrole of counter-terrorist policies for decades to come, regardless of their actual\nimpact on societal and individual security.\nAnother very real danger is that the \u201cwar on terrorism,\u201d as it is currently\nconstructed and practiced, is actually making international terrorism worse\nthrough entrenching cycles of violence and counter-violence; that just as has\nalready occurred in Israel, Chechnya, Kashmir, Colombia, Iraq, Algeria,\nSpain, and other places, it is making the world less secure, more violent, and\nmore unjust, and creating self-fulfilling prophesies\u2014where \u201cterrorism foretold\nmust become prophesy fulfilled at some point.\u201d89 In other words, there is a\nrisk of constructing a situation of perpetual war where terrorism and counter-\nterrorism become indistinguishable; where the discursive practices of a \u201cwar\non terrorism\u201d echo and mimic the very absolutist mentality and exceptionalist\ntactics of the terrorists themselves. Moreover, there is a very real danger that\nthe \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d may damage our own societies through weakening\ndemocratic values and undermining the legitimacy of democratic institutions\n(such as the judicial system, the police and the security services). Historically,\nthe construction and reproduction of the \u201csecurity state\u201d almost inevitably\nleads to a narrowing of civic culture and political life\u2014the constriction of poli-\ntics through demonising an ever-widening variety of dissent.90 Related to this,\nthe creation of moral panics can victimize minorities and inflame inter-ethnic\ntensions, at the same time as they militarize society and normalize state\nintrusion and coercion. In short, the danger is that the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d\nbecomes a \u201cwar of terrorism\u201d.\nMore importantly, the discourse and practice of counter-terrorism can\nlead to the de-legitimizing of dissent and the narrowing of the discursive space\nfor political debate. Already, conservatives have attacked anti-globalization\nprotesters, academics, postmodernists, liberals, pro-choice activists, environ-\nmentalists, and gay liberationists as being aligned with terrorism and its\ninherent evil.91 The moral taxonomy of the good versus evil construction in\nparticular, is extremely corrosive of democratic politics because it undermines\nthe possibility of a loyal opposition.92 Moreover, the invocation of evil is a pow-\nerful tool for ending arguments and displacing more complex understandings\nof political and social events; the suffocating logic of the discourse makes it\nexceedingly difficult to think clearly about the terrorist attacks and the\ncounter-terrorist war that has followed.93 This may not signal the return of\nMcCarthyism or the \u201cend of politics\u201d quite yet, but there is little doubt that\nthe body politic is starting to show signs of sickness.\nFinally, there are real dangers for the stability of the international system\nitself. For instance, there is the danger of de-stabilizing already unstable\nSecurity, Democracy 167\nregions through the application of pre-emptive war doctrines (the operative\nconclusion of the discourse) by states that are currently fighting insurgencies\nand terrorist campaigns. Many of these states\u2014Russia, China, Algeria, India,\nIsrael, Macedonia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Zimbabwe\u2014have already re-framed\ntheir struggles against internal dissidents as local \u201cwars on terrorism\u201d as a way of\nboth muting international criticism and garnering fresh support. Additionally,\nthere is little doubt that the Iraq war phase of the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d has\nundermined institutions of global governance, particularly the United\nNations, and the conduct of US forces and military doctrines are re-asserting\nexclusivist communitarian values (it is the duty and right of every state to value\nthe lives of its own citizens above the lives of all others) over cosmopolitan\nvalues.\nIf these and other dangers are to be avoided, we must first reclaim the\nright to question and debate the profound policy issues that lie at the heart of\nthe \u201cwar on terrorism,\u201d and challenge the normative foundations of counter-\nterrorist violence. In large part, such an engagement will only be possible\nwhen the deconstruction of the discursive straightjacket we are currently\ntrapped within begins in earnest.\nNOTES\n1.

CDA is at once both a technique for analyzing specific texts or speech acts, and a\nway of understanding the relationship between discourse and social and political phe-\nnomena. By engaging in concrete, linguistic textual analysis\u2014that is, by doing system-\natic analyses of spoken and written language\u2014CDA aims to shed light on the links\nbetween texts and societal practices and structures, or, the linguistic-discursive dimen-\nsion of social action. In addition, because individual text analysis is not sufficient on its\nown to shed light on the relationship between discourse and social processes, CDA adds\na wider inter-disciplinary perspective which combines textual and social-political anal-\nysis.
