Res., 115, C06021, doi:10.1029\/2009JC005529.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Dimethylsulphide (DMS) is a climate relevant gas\nproduced in marine ecosystems and emitted to the atmo-\nsphere [e.g., Stefels et al., 2007], where it is oxidized to\nsulphate aerosol and involved in the formation of cloud\ncondensation nuclei [Charlson et al., 1987]. Charlson et al.\n[1987] suggested a potential feedback mechanism by which\nalgae could impact climate through the regulation of the\nsulphur cycle. The so\u2010called \u201cCLAW hypothesis\u201d states that\nalgae may be able to influence CCN number density through\nDMS emissions as a response to increased temperatures\nand\/or increased UV radiation. If this hypothesis were true,\nalgae may be able to produce a negative feedback to global\nwarming.\n[3] Despite the importance of DMS for the global sulphur\ncycle, the metabolical role of DMS in marine organisms\nis poorly known [e.g., Stefels et al., 2007]. In marine eco-\nsystems DMS is produced from its phytoplanktonic pre-\ncursor particulate dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSPp).\nThe dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP)\u2010DMS system has\nbeen suggested to play a role in the osmoprotection of the\ncell [Vairavamurthy et al., 1985; Dickson and Kirst, 1986,\n1987a, 1987b], as a cryoprotectant [Karsten et al., 1992,\n1996], as an antioxidant [Sunda et al., 2002] or as a grazing\ndeterrent system [Wolfe and Steinke, 1996]. DMSPp is\nreleased to the water column upon cell lysis, during grazing\n[Wolfe and Steinke, 1996], through algal mortality [Nguyen\net al., 1988] or upon viral infection [Malin et al., 1998].\nDissolved DMSP (DMSPd) can serve as a substrate for\nbacterial growth (reviewed by Kiene and Slezak [2006], and\ncan be cleaved by several bacterial enzymes to DMS [Todd\net al., 2007, 2009; Curson et al., 2008]. DMS itself can also\nbe used as bacterial substrate for a set of specialist bacteria\n[Vila\u2010Costa et al., 2006], can be photolysed in the upper\nmeters of the water column [Brimblecombe and Shooter,\n1986; Kieber et al., 1996] and is ventilated across the\nsea\u2010air interface [Liss and Slater, 1974; Zemmelink et al.,\n2004a, 2004b].\n[4] Several attempts have been made to simulate global\nDMS concentration patterns using diagnostic models [Sim\u00f3\nand Dachs, 2002; Belviso et al., 2004; Vallina and Sim\u00f3,\n2007]. Models using mixed layer depth and solar radiation\ndose as a proxy for DMS surface concentrations have been\nparticularly successful in simulating observed surface con-\ncentration patterns and seasonality [Sim\u00f3 and Dachs, 2002;\nVallina et al., 2007]. A strong linear relationship between\n1School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich,\nUK.\n2Laboratoire des Sciences du Climate et de l\u2019Environnement, IPSL,\nCEA Saclay, CNRS, Gif\u2010sur\u2010Yvette, France.\n3British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JC005529\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, C06021, doi:10.1029\/2009JC005529, 2010\nC06021 1 of 21\nobserved DMS and solar radiation dose (SRD) in the mixed\nlayer depth has been identified [Vallina and Sim\u00f3, 2007],\nthat accounts for more than 80% of the seasonal variability\nin the Sargasso Sea.\n[5] The construction of global mechanistic models may\nshed light on the underlying mechanisms of DMS produc-\ntion in complex marine food webs. Current global prognostic\nDMS models are based on state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art multiplankton\nfunctional type models (Dynamic Green Ocean Models\n(DGOMs) [Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2005]), and represent the DMS\ncycle with up to 3 sulphurous tracers (DMS, DMSPp and\/or\nDMSPd) [Bopp et al., 2008; Six and Maier\u2010Reimer, 2006;\nChu et al., 2003]. Most prognostic models represent surface\nDMS patterns reasonably well in the mid\u2010 and high latitudes,\nwhere DMS and chlorophyll are tightly coupled, but\nsome are unable to simulate the observed decoupling of\nDMS and chlorophyll\u2010a in the low latitudes [e.g., Six and\nMaier\u2010Reimer, 2006]: Between ca. 40\u00b0N and 40\u00b0S, DMS\nconcentrations are maximal during the summer, when\nchlorophyll concentrations are at their lowest [Vallina et al.,\n2006]. In contrast, DMS concentrations are low during the\nspring bloom, when chlorophyll values are maximal in this\narea. This behavior was called the \u201csummer paradox\u201d [Sim\u00f3\nand Pedr\u00f3s\u2010Ali\u00f3, 1999; Toole et al., 2003]. A mathematical\nanalysis of the system of equations describing the evolution\nof DMS in one prognostic model revealed that DMS\ndynamics were \u201cslaved\u201d to the dynamics of the ecosystem\nmodel [Cropp et al., 2004]. Given that the model equations\nanalysed by Cropp et al. [2004] are fairly similar to other\nequations used in current DMS model, this finding is likely\nto be representative for the characteristics of other DMS\nmodels. The authors conclude that decoupling between\nDMS and chlorophyll is difficult to achieve without an\nexternal forcing, a finding exploited, e.g., by Lef\u00e8vre et al.\n[2002]. Consequently, some authors opt for the inclusion of\nDMS source and sink terms with an explicit dependence on\nenvironmental conditions such as light, in order to achieve\nthe observed decoupling [Vallina et al., 2008].\n[6] The Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Station (BATS) in\nthe Sargasso Sea is one location where DMS measurements\nare available and which features the summer paradox\n[Dacey et al., 1998]. Several 1\u2010D prognostic DMS models\nhave been tuned and applied to this location, but modelers\nstill have to reach a consensus on which mechanism(s) are\nessential to explain the summer paradox. Species shifts,\nincreased exudation due to light stress [Sunda et al., 2002]\nand bacterial inhibition of DMS degradation [Slezak et al.,\n2001] have been suggested as possible mechanisms to\ndecouple DMS and chlorophyll, but 1\u2010D DMS models reach\ndecoupling using different mechanisms [Lef\u00e8vre et al.,\n2002; Toole et al., 2008; Vallina et al., 2008].\n[7] Here we present a new global fully prognostic DMS\nmodel that achieves decoupling of DMS and chlorophyll\u2010a\nin parts of the low latitudes. In the first part of this paper\nwe evaluate the results of our DMS model using DMS\nobservations from Kettle and Andreae [2000]. We conduct a\nsensitivity analysis and discuss the main parameters influ-\nencing DMS concentration patterns. In the second part of\nour study, we focus on DMS seasonality and the summer\nparadox. We study the relative importance of ecosystem\ncomposition, species succession and the direct effect of light\nstress for the seasonal cycle of DMS. We show that direct\nrelease of DMS from phytoplankton is one possible mech-\nanism through which the observed seasonality in the low\nlatitudes can be simulated. We compare modeled and\nobserved DMS(P) patterns at BATS and demonstrate that\nwith a global model developed to represent global DMS\nseasonality it is possible to achieve a reasonable represen-\ntation of DMS and DMSP at this site.\n2. Model Description\n2.1. Physical Sea\u2010Ice\u2010Ocean CoupledModel and Forcing\n[8] We use the OPA8.1 ocean general circulation model\n(OGCM). OPA is a fully prognostic OGCM based on the\nprimitive equations [Madec et al., 1998]. The model output\nis projected onto the irregular ORCA grid, which has a\nlongitudinal resolution of 2 degrees and a latitudinal reso-\nlution of 1.5\u00b0 enhanced to 0.5\u00b0 at the equator and at the\npoles. The vertical resolution is 10 m in the upper 100 m and\ncomprises of 31 depth levels down to the ocean floor. The\nvertical eddy diffusivity and viscosity coefficients are cal-\nculated using a 1.5 order turbulent closure scheme which\nexplicitly calculates mixed layer depth as a function of shear\nstress [Gasper et al., 1990] and produces a minimum of\ndiffusion in the thermocline. The sea\u2010ice component of\nORCA\u2010LIM is the prognostic sea\u2010ice model Louvain\u2010La\u2010\nNeuve Sea Ice Model (LIM [Fichefet and Maqueda, 1999;\nTimmermann et al., 2005]). OPA\u2010ORCA\u2010LIM is forced\nwith daily data from the NCEP reanalysis for precipitation,\nwind stress and cloud cover [Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2007]. The\nmodel calculates its own heat flux using a bulk formulation.\nWe use a constant freshwater input from rivers [da Cunha\net al., 2007].\n2.2. Biogeochemical Model: PlankTOM5\n[9] We use the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art ocean biogeochemistry\nmodel PlankTOM5, which represents ecosystem dynamics\nbased on plankton functional types (PFTs) [Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al.,\n2005]. PlankTOM5 represents 3 phytoplankton functional\ntypes (pPFTs): silicifiers (diatoms) and calcifiers (cocco-\nlithophores) and mixed phytoplankton (nanophytoplankton)\nand 2 zooplankton functional types (zPFTs): micro\u2010 and\nmesozooplankton. The prognostic variables for the 3 pPFTs\nare their total biomass in carbon units, iron, chlorophyll and\nsilicium content for the silicifiers. For the two size classes of\nzPFTs, only the biomass is modeled. All PFTs are assumed\nto have a constant C:N:P ratio. The ratios of Fe:C and Chl:C\nare variable and fully determined by the model. Si:C is\ncalculated for diatoms only.\n[10] PlankTOM5 comprises 29 biogeochemical tracers. It\nsimulates the full cycles of phosphate, silicate, carbon,\noxygen and contains a simplified iron cycle. The current\nmodel version includes limitation of phytoplanktonic growth\nby a macronutrient (phosphate, nitrate and ammonium),\nsilicate and iron. Phosphate and nitrate uptake are not inde-\npendent. The phosphate\/nitrogen pool undergoes nitrogen\nfixation and denitrification. The model also describes 8 fur-\nther dissolved and particulate abiotic compartments: dis-\nsolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved oxygen and\nalkalinity, semilabile dissolved organic matter (DOM), small\n(organic) and big (ballasted) sinking particles, CaCO3 and\nSiO2. The model includes a ballast effect based on Stoke\u2019s\nLaw [Buitenhuis et al., 2001], and calculates the sinking\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n2 of 21\nspeed of big particles from the concentration of carbonate\n(CaCO3) and silicate (SiO2).\n[11] The evolution of each prognostic variable T in the\nmodel is governed by the processes of advection, diffu-\nsion and biogeochemical transformation, as described in\nequation (1)\ndT\ndt\n\u00bc r ~uT\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe r ~KrT\u0001 \u0003\u00fe SMS: \u00f01\u00de\nThe first right\u2010hand term of equation (1) stands for\nadvection, with ~u being the 3\u2010D velocity vector of\nadvection. The second term stands for diffusion, with ~K\nrepresenting the 3\u2010D tracer diffusion coefficients. Biogeo-\nchemical processes are expressed as the balance between\nbiological source and sink terms (SMS; Sources Minus\nSinks). The air\u2010sea fluxes of trace gases are parameterized\naccording to Wanninkhof [1992] and are included in the\nSMS terms.\n[12] The biogeochemical model is initialized with observa-\ntions of DIC and alkalinity from the Global Ocean Data\nAnalysis Project (GLODAP [Key et al., 2004]) and with\nnutrient fields for phosphate, silicate and oxygen from\nthe World Ocean Atlas (2001). The biogeochemistry is\nforced with dust input of iron and silicate [Tegen and Fung,\n1995]. The biological variables in the model are initialized\nusing simulated tracer concentrations from a previous\nmodel run.\n2.3. DMS Module of PlankTOM5\n[13] We added three additional variables describing\nthe DMS cycle in PlankTOM5: The model simulates\ndimethylsulphide (DMS), particulate dimethylsulphonio-\npropionate (DMSPp) and dissolved DMSP (DMSPd) con-\ncentrations and their cycling within the marine food web.\nAll equations are semiempirical and take into account cur-\nrent experimental constraints on the parameters used. Within\nthe observational range of parameter uncertainty, the model\nhas been tuned to optimize the representation of DMS sea-\nsonality. Equations describing the dynamics of PFT biomass\nhave been adopted from PlankTOM5 without modifications.\nThe sulphur mass budget is not closed and sulphur is never\nlimiting to DMSP synthesis by the 3 pPFTs. However, sul-\nphur cycling is constantly limited by the flow rates between\necosystem constituents. A list of all parameters used in the\nDMS module of PlankTOM5 is given in the Table 1 of this\npaper for the standard run.\n2.3.1. Dynamics of DMSPp, DMSPd, and DMS\n[14] The dynamics of DMS, DMSPp and DMSPd\n(concentrations in molL ) are described according to the fol-\nlowing time\u2010dependent equations:\nDMSPp \u00bc\nX3\ni\u00bci\nqi*Pi; \u00f02\u00de\n@DMSPd\n@t\n\u00bc\nX3\ni\u00bc1\n\u00f01\u0002 \u0002dms\u00de* \u0003micPi *gmicPi \u00fe \u0003mesPi *gmesPi\n\u0004 \u0005\n\u00fe mPi\n\u0004 \u0005\n*qi\nh i\n\u0002 \u0003DL*DMSPd \u0002 \u0004bacDMSP*DMSPd; \u00f03\u00de\n@DMS\n@t\n\u00bc\nX3\ni\u00bc1\n\u0006\u0007\n\u0002dms* \u0003\nmic\nPi\n*gmicPi \u00fe \u0003mesPi *gmesPi\n\u0004 \u0005\n\u00fe mPi\n\u00fe \u0003exudi * PAR\nPARmax\n*Pi\n\b\n*qi\n\t\n\u00fe \u0003bac*\u0004bacDMSP*DMSPd\n\u00fe \u0003DL*DMSPd \u0002 \u0003light*PAR*DMS\n\u0002 \u0004bacDMS*DMS \u0002 FDMS ; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere qi is the internal cell quota for DMSP for the 3 dif-\nferent pPFTs Pi, i = 1, 2, 3 and t is time.

DMSPp Cell Quota\n[15] The DMSPp cell quota of a PFT qi describes the ratio\nof sulphur to carbon for each pPFT Pi. In laboratory and\nfield experiments, this quota has been observed to vary with\nalgal taxon, species, and environmental conditions (tem-\nperature, nutrient status, solar radiation dose; reviewed, e.g.,\nby Stefels et al. [2007]). Given the large observed differ-\nences in DMSPp quota between different species of the\nsame algal taxon and the large range of DMSPp levels\nobserved within one species as a function of environmental\nstress, the cell quota of the 3 pPFTs are only poorly con-\nstrained. Here, we use a literature value, qlit, suggested by\nStefels et al. [2007] as a benchmark for the 3 modeled\npPFTs. The simulated cell quota is allowed to vary as a\nfunction of both light (PAR) and nutrient (Fe, PO4) stress\n[Sunda et al., 2002] (s1, s2, s3) and is temperature (T)\ndependent. The T dependence simulates the function of\nDMS and DMSP in cryoprotection [Karsten et al., 1992,\n1996]. It has been set to enhance the quota for temperatures\nof 0\u00b0C or below. Hence, the DMSP cell quota for pPFT Pi is\ndescribed as\nqi \u00bc max s1; s2; s3; 0:3\u00f0 \u00de*2:\u0002 fcorr\u00f0 \u00de* 1\u00fe 1\nT \u00fe 2:5\u00f0 \u00de6\n !\n*qlit; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere\ns1 \u00bc PARPARmax ; \u00f06\u00de\ns2 \u00bc K\ni\nFe\nFe\u00fe KiFe\n; \u00f07\u00de\ns3 \u00bc 0:7*\nKiPO4\nPO4 \u00fe KiPO4\n; \u00f08\u00de\nwith the KN\ni being the phytoplanktonic half saturation con-\nstants for nutrient N and each PFT Pi, and fcorr an adjustable\ncorrection factor to tune global DMSPp concentrations,\ncurrently set to 0.25. Taking into account all the above\nterms, qi can vary between 0.4 and ca. 2.3 \u00d7 qlit, which is\nconsistent with observational variations in cell quota [Stefels\net al., 2007]. Due to their definition, the environmental\nstressors s1, s2 and s3 are dominant at different latitudes:\nWhile light stress is dominant at tropical and subtropical\nlatitudes, PO4\n\u2212 stress is greatest in temperate waters and Fe\nstress is maximal in the Southern Ocean (not shown).\nHence, light stress is expected to be most important for the\nsimulation of the summer paradox.\n2.3.3. Grazing, Mortality, and Biomasses\n[16] Grazing of microzooplankton on any given pPFT is\ndescribed by the following equations in PlankTOM5\n[Buitenhuis et al., 2006]:\ngmicPi \u00bc Gmicmax*aT*\npmicPi *Pi\nKmicPi \u00fe\nP\nj p\nmic\nFj\n*Fj\n*MIC; \u00f09\u00de\nand similarly for mesozooplankton\ngmesPi \u00bc Gmesmax*bT*\npmesPi *Pi\nKmesPi \u00fe\nP\nj p\nmes\nFj\n*Fj\n*MES; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere gPi\nZ is the amount of pPFT Pi that is grazed by zPFT Zj\nper timestep. Gmax\nZ is the maximal grazing rate for zPFT Zj at\n0\u00b0, a and b are the temperature (T) dependences of grazing,\nand pFi\nZ is the preference for food Fi. MIC and MES are the\nbiomasses of micro\u2010 and mesozooplankton and KZ,i is the\nzooplanktonic half saturation constant for grazing. All other\ngrowth and loss terms, such as the phytoplanktonic mor-\ntality rates, and the biomasses for both pPFT and zPFT are\nalso derived directly from PlankTOM5.\n[17] In the DMSP module, the ratio of DMSPd\/DMS\nproduced in grazing is described according to equations (3)\nand (4). aDMS describes the ratio of DMS to DMSPd\nreleased in grazing processes. It is assumed to be 1:9\n[Archer et al., 2002]. The constants lPi\nZ have been defined in\nagreement with those for the cycling of carbon within the\nzooplankton grazers [Buitenhuis et al., 2006]. This means\nthat the fate of ingested DMSPp (loss through sloppy\nfeeding or respiration, incorporation into biomass, excre-\ntion) is coupled to the fate of ingested carbon.\n[18] All in all, a total 74% of DMSPp ingested by\nmicrozooplankton and a total of 59% ingested by meso-\nzooplankton is released to the liquid phase as DMSPd and is\navailable for further biological processing [Buitenhuis et al.,\n2006]. (Fraction of grazed carbon incorporated into the body\nmass of the grazers: 26%, fraction of carbon released to the\nwater column due to \u2018sloppy feeding\u2019: 11%, fraction\nrespired: 33%, fraction excreted into the seawater: 30%.\nHence, a total of 74% of ingested carbon is released. We\nassume that 50% of DMSPp excreted by mesozooplankton\nis exported (M. Steinke, personal communication, 2006).\nThus, only 59% of DMSPd ingested by mesozooplankton is\navailable for further processing.)\n2.3.4. Exudation\/Leakage\n[19] Based on the findings reported by Vallina et al.\n[2008] a term leading directly from phytoplankton to\nDMS as a function of environmental conditions has been\nimplemented in the model. We call this term the \u201cexudation\nterm,\u201d despite the current lack of experimental evidence\nfor such direct transfer of DMS across the cell membrane.\nThe direct release of DMS from phytoplanktonic cells is\nin agreement with Sunda et al. [2002], i.e., DMS may be\npart of an oxidant chain triggered under light and nutrient\nstress.\n[20] The modeled exudation of DMS is assumed to be\nlight dependent and proportional to the intracellular DMSPp\nconcentration. Given that there are no experimental con-\nstraints on DMS exudation rates, we assumed the lowest\npossible exudation rates that still allowed decoupling in the\ntropics and were consistent with observed DMS concentra-\ntions. Thus, the so\u2010derived exudation rates are a factor 4\nlower than those used by Vallina et al. [2008] and vary with\nphytoplankton group. Exudation of DMS by diatoms was\nset to be 10\u00d7 lower than the exudation rates of the other\npPFTs, in analogy to the ratio used by Archer et al. [2002]\nfor DMSP exudation. The exudation of DMSPd by phyto-\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n4 of 21\nplankton has been neglected. Thus, the exudation term is\nparameterized as\n@DMS\n@t\n\u0007 \b\nexudation\n\u00bc \u0003exud* PAR\nPARmax\n*DMSPp; \u00f011\u00de\nwith lexud being a constant rate term (see Table 1) and PAR\nthe light available for photosynthesis.\n2.3.5. Cleavage of DMSP by Free DMSP Lyase\n[21] In seawater, a small fraction of DMSPd is cleaved by\nfree DMSP lyase [Scarratt et al., 2000]. The suspended\nDMSP lyase is assumed to originate from DMSP lyase con-\ntaining algae and to be released after cell lysis. The cleavage\nby DMSP lyase is parameterized as a small and constant\nproportion (lDL, Table 1) of the DMSPd concentration\n@DMSP\n@t\n\u0007 \b\ncleavage\n\u00bc \u0002\u0003DL*DMSPd: \u00f012\u00de\n2.3.6. Bacterial Degradation of DMSPd\n[22] PlankTOM5 parameterizes bacterial remineralization\nof organic matter, but does not include an explicit formu-\nlation for bacterial biomass. We use an implicit formulation\nfollowing Aumont and Bopp [2006], where bacterial bio-\nmass is a function of zooplankton biomass, multiplied by a\ndepth profile (see below). Bacterial degradation is then\nparameterized using normalized biomass and a bacterial\nactivity on DMSPd. Thus,\n\u0004bacDMSPd \u00bc \u0005bacmax*Lbactot *dT*B; \u00f013\u00de\nwhere mmax\nbac is the maximal bacterial growth rate (0.6 d\u22121),\nLtot\nbac the total nutrient limitation for bacteria, dT the tem-\nperature dependence of growth and B the dimensionless\nnormalized bacterial biomass. The bacterial temperature\ndependence dT has been chosen, so that Q10\nbac = 3, i.e., d =\n1.116. The individual terms are calculated as\nLbactot \u00bc min Lbacnut ;\nDMSPd\nDMSPd \u00fe KbacDMSPd\n\u0007 \b\n*Lbaclight; \u00f014\u00de\nLbacnut \u00bc min\nPO4\nPO4 \u00fe KbacPO4\n;\nFe\nFe\u00fe KbacFe\n;\nDOC\nDOC \u00fe KbacDOC\n !\n; \u00f015\u00de\nLbaclight \u00bc min 1:;max 0:66; 1:\u0002\nPAR\nPARmax\n\u0007 \b6\n\u00fe 0:18\n ! !\n; \u00f016\u00de\nB \u00bc 0:7* MIC \u00fe 2*MES\u00f0 \u00de\nBnorm\n*min 1;\ndepthc\ndepth\n\u0007 \b\n; \u00f017\u00de\nwith Lnut\nbac being the bacterial nutrient limitation of the model,\nexcluding DMSPd, Llight\nbac being the bacterial limitation of\nDMSPd degradation as a function of insolation [Slezak et al.,\n2001]. Bacterial activity is a function of the nutrient avail-\nability of both DOM and DMSP and parametrized using the\nminimum of 4 Michaelis\u2010Menten functions, with PO4\nphosphate, Fe iron and DOC dissolved organic matter\nconcentrations. The KN\nbac are the bacterial half saturation\nconstants for the respective nutrient N, with 122*KPO4\nbac =\n0.1 mmol L\u22121,KFe\nbac = 0.025 nmol L\u22121 andKDOC\nbac = 5 mmol L\u22121.\nBacterial biomass is calculated implicitly using a regression\nwith zooplankton biomass and depth (depthc = 120 m), and\nnormalized to a standard value (Bnorm = 4*10 mmol C L\n\u22121).\nThis relationship was obtained from a correlation of\noutput from a version of the PISCES model containing an\nexplicit representation of bacteria (O. Aumont, personal\ncommunication, 2006).\n2.3.7. Bacterial Degradation of DMS\n[23] The formulation for bacterial degradation of DMS\nclosely resembles the one used to simulate bacterial degrada-\ntion of DMSPd. However, different half saturation constants\nwere used for DMS and DMSPd [Archer et al., 2002]. Hence,\n\u0004bacDMS \u00bc \u0005bacmax*Lbactot *dT*\u0002bac*B; \u00f018\u00de\nwith B and dT as above and\nLbactot \u00bc min Lbacnut ;\nDMS\nDMS \u00fe KbacDMS\n\u0007 \b\n*Lbaclight : \u00f019\u00de\n[24] Based on Vila\u2010Costa et al. [2006], we assume that\napproximately 33% (abac) of the bacterial community can\nutilize DMS. In the model, DMS degrading bacteria are\nlimited both by the availability of DOC and of DMS, which\nis expressed by calculating the minimum of 4 Michaelis\u2010\nMenten functions as above.\n2.3.8. Photolysis of DMS\n[25] At present, PlankTOM5 does not simulate the prop-\nagation of UV light through the water column. Hence,\ndespite the fact that DMS photolysis is driven mainly by UV\nwavelengths, the photolysis rate for DMS is assumed to be\na linear function of incident PAR and DMS concentration.\nPAR and UV are approximately linearly related in surface\nwaters on cloud free days and on a monthly average [see,\ne.g., Vantrepotte and M\u00e9lin, 2006, Figure 2.1, p. 25].\nFurthermore, DMS is not directly photolysed in seawater\n[Brimblecombe and Shooter, 1986; Brugger et al., 1998],\nbut oxidized by free radicals created through the photolysis\nof coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). CDOM\nconcentrations, however, are not modeled in PlankTOM5,\nand hence our equations are a function of light (PAR)\nonly. The rate constants used are within the experimental\nrange of uncertainty for the Sargasso Sea [Bailey et al.,\n2008; Toole and Siegel, 2004]\n@DMS\n@t\n\u0007 \b\nphotolysis\n\u00bc \u0002\u0003light*PAR*DMS; \u00f020\u00de\nwhere llight is given in Table 1.\n2.3.9. Sea\u2010Air Fluxes of DMS\n[26] The sea to air flux of DMS is given by the product of\nsea\u2010to\u2010air transfer velocity and the difference in concentra-\ntion of DMS across the sea\u2010air interface [Liss and Slater,\n1974]. Because the air concentration is assumed to be\nnegligible, the general flux equation is simplified to\nFair \u00bc kw*DMSaq; \u00f021\u00de\nwhere DMSaq is the sea surface concentration of DMS. The\nsea to air fluxes are calculated according to Wanninkhof\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n5 of 21\n[1992] as a square function of wind speed and temperature.\nThe Schmidt number for DMS has been calculated accord-\ning to Saltzman et al. [1993].\n3. Model Setup\n3.1. General Description\n[27] We run PlankTOM5 including the sulphur cycle\nstarting from 1992 to 2007. DMSP and DMS have been\ninitialized with concentrations of zero nM everywhere, and\nthe module has been run until it reached steady state. An\nequilibrium between DMS(P) source and sink terms was\nreached after 7 years of calculation (no more major changes\nin DMS concentrations). The equilibrium time scale has\nbeen found empirically and corresponds to the equilibrium\ntime of the biogeochemistry model [da Cunha et al., 2007],\ni.e., the timescale beyond which total annual mean tracer\nconcentrations remain constant for constant forcing. We use\nthe simulation of year 2006 for all output fields. The\ninterannual variability of global mean surface DMS con-\ncentrations is low during 1999\u20132007 (global annual mean\nsurface DMS varies by less than 0.1%), so that the use of\none arbitrary year during this time period is representative.\n3.2. Studying the Controls on DMS Seasonality\n[28] We use 4 sensitivity experiments in order to inves-\ntigate the impact of light and ecosystem composition on\nDMS concentration patterns, the seasonality of DMS and\nthe coupling between DMS and chlorophyll\u2010a (Table 2):\nRun 1 (referred to as \u201cSEP,\u201d i.e., \u201cStress\u2010Exudation\u2010PFT\u201d)\nis the standard run, as described above. This run includes the\ndirect DMS exudation term from phytoplankton and a PFT\u2010\nspecific DMSPp cell quota varying with light and nutrient\nstress. Run 2 (\u201cSNEP,\u201d i.e., \u201cStress\u2010No Exudation\u2010PFT\u201d)\nincludes a PFT\u2010specific and stress\u2010dependent DMSPp cell\nquota, but does not include the exudation term. This run was\ntuned to best fit the observed annual concentration means\nand DMS seasonality in the tropics. PlankTOM5\u2010SNEP was\nconstructed to demonstrate how much decoupling of DMS\nand chlorophyll is possible when parameters are kept\nwithin the range of observational constraints and when\nexternal forcings do not influence DMS patterns directly.\nAll parameters are as for the standard run, but minimal\nDMSPp cell quota had to be doubled in order to get realistic\nDMS fields. The doubling of all cell quota did not affect\nDMS seasonality, but adjusted overall DMSPp levels to be\nwithin the observed range. Run 3 (\u201cSENP\u201d) has a variable\nbut PFT\u2010independent cell quota and includes exudation.\nRun 4 (\u201cNSENP\u201d) has a constant DMSPp cell quota for all\nPFTs and includes exudation. These runs are used to test the\neffect of ecosystem composition on DMS concentration\npatterns and DMS seasonality and to study the coupling\nbetween DMS and chlorophyll\u2010a.\n4. Results\n4.1. Model Evaluation: Chlorophyll\u2010a and Ecosystem\nComposition\n[29] Table 3 summarizes the diagnostics used to evaluate\nPlankTOM5 in OPA. The model results for primary pro-\nduction (57.4 Pg C yr\u22121) fall within the range of estimates\nbased on observational data [Behrenfeld and Falkowski,\n1997]. Model export production (9.1 Pg C yr\u22121) is only\nslightly below observational estimates (11 Tg C yr\u22121\n[Schlitzer, 2004]). While microzooplankton grazing is close\nto observational estimates [Calbet, 2001], mesozooplankton\ngrazing on phytoplankton is overestimated by the model\n[Calbet and Landry, 2004], although the uncertainty in the\ndata is large. Based on marker pigment measurements [Uitz\net al., 2006], Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al. [2005] estimated the biomasses\nof all 3 pPFTs to be around 0.1\u20130.4 Pg C yr\u22121. PlankTOM5\nmay slightly overestimate total phytoplanktonic biomass, but\ngiven the large uncertainty in the association of pigment data\nwith biomass, this estimate can only serve as a coarse indi-\ncator of the relative abundance of these groups (Table 3).\nModeled and observed chlorophyll\u2010a are compared in\nFigure 1. The agreement between model and data is rea-\nsonable, especially in the Southern Ocean. However,\nPlankTOM5 underestimates chlorophyll concentrations in\nthe Arctic, in the North Atlantic and in most of the upwelling\nregions.\nTable 2.

For the sake of simplicity,\nwe use the satellite\u2010derived group of diatoms for the silici-\nfiers, coccolithophores for the calcifiers and nanoeukaryotes\nfor nanophytoplankton. In the observations, regions in white\ncorrespond to regions where none of the 3 PFT discussed\nabove is dominant. In the model results, white areas are\neither characterized by the lack of one group that constitutes\nmore than 50% of total chlorophyll or by chlorophyll con-\ncentrations less than 0.3 mg m\u22123. This threshold was set\nbecause the low chlorophyll regions are observed to be\ndominated by Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus\u2010like pi-\ncophytoplankton [Alvain et al., 2008], groups that are not\nrepresented in PlankTOM5. As a consequence, the low\nlatitudes are modeled to be dominated by coccolithophores\nand mixed phytoplankton. A dominance value of 1 means\nthat the PFT is dominant in 12\/12 months, whereas a value\nof 0 means that it is not dominant in any of the months.\n[31] Figures 2a and 2b show the relative dominance of\ndiatoms in both model and data. PlankTOM5 under-\nestimates diatom dominance in the northern parts of the\nSouthern Ocean, but represents dominance patterns well\nclose to the Antarctic continent. The model slightly over-\nestimates diatom dominance in the Arctic and in the North\nAtlantic and North West Pacific. The annual relative nano-\nphytoplankton dominance is in good agreement with the\ndominance of its satellite\u2010derived analogue for the Southern\nOcean (Figures 2c and 2d). In the Northern Hemisphere\n(NH), nanophytoplankton dominance is consistently under-\nestimated by the model. Furthermore, PlankTOM5 predicts\na nanophytoplankton dominance in the Equatorial Pacific,\nwhich is not present in the observations. For the cocco-\nlithophores (Figures 2e and 2f), the agreement between\nmodeled and satellite\u2010derived populations is reasonable in\nthe NH. The model predicts slightly higher dominance of\ncoccolithophores in the Arctic. As discussed by Alvain et al.\n[2006], this group is likely to be underestimated by the\nsatellite measurements, so that higher Arctic dominance\nvalues are possible.\n[32] Figure 3 shows the observed and simulated biomass\nof the two zooplankton functional types, microzooplankton\n(Figures 3a and 3b) and mesozooplankton (Figures 3c and\n3d). A throrough validation of the two zooplankton func-\ntional types has been performed by Buitenhuis et al. [2006]\nand E. Buitenhuis et al. (Biogeochemical fluxes through\nmicrozooplankton, submitted to Global Biogeochemical\nCycles, 2009). While the distributions of mesozooplankton\nfrom modeled and observed estimates match well, the\nmicrozooplankton biomass is underestimated. In particular,\nthe model cannot reproduce high concentrations of micro-\nzooplankton on the continental shelves and in coastal areas.\nThis may partly be due to large seasonal fluctuations in\nmicrozooplankton biomass, which are not captured by the\nmodel. In addition, there is uncertainty in the carbon con-\nversion factors used to convert zooplankton counts into\nbiomass, which may lead to overestimates of the observa-\ntions. However, distributions in the Southern Ocean as well\nas in parts of the Atlantic (40\u00b0N\u201340\u00b0S) seemed to be cap-\ntured well by the model.\n4.2. Model Results: DMS, DMSPp, and DMSPd\n(Standard Run)\n4.2.1. Global Annual Mean Surface Concentrations\n[33] The first and second columns in Table 4 contain the\nmain statistical characteristics for the globally integrated\naverage DMS surface concentrations compared to DMS\nfrom Kettle and Andreae [2000]. PlankTOM5 simulates an\nintegrated global annual surface mean of 1.9 nM, which\nis similar to the estimates by Kettle and Andreae [2000]\n(1.6 nM). However, PlankTOM5 underestimates maximal\nDMS concentrations. This is mostly because high coastal\nDMS values cannot be simulated in the model. The analysis\nof the 95 percentile as a proxy for open ocean concentrations\nshow a better agreement between model (95% of con-\ncentrations below 5.77 nM) and data (95% of data below\n5.43 nM). PlankTOM5 underestimates the global spread of\nDMS concentrations, as given by the standard deviation. The\ncalculation of the cost function to quantify model\u2010data\nagreement according to Allen et al. [2007] gives the value of\nFigure 1. Comparison of annual mean chlorophyll\u2010a for (a) SeaWiFS satellite observational data and\n(b) PlankTOM5.\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n7 of 21\ncf = 0.94 for the standard run, with cf<1 belonging to the\ncategory of \u201cvery good agreement\u201d [Mar\u00e9chal, 2004].\n[34] We now compare annual mean DMS concentrations\non the basin scale. The simulated annual average surface\nconcentrations of DMS (Figure 4b) compare reasonably\nwell with the interpolated climatology of Figure 4a [Kettle\nand Andreae, 2000]. Annual mean DMSPp and DMSPd\nconcentrations are shown in Figures 4c and 4d. While the\nmodel is able to simulate some of the high DMS con-\ncentrations in the Arctic, it underpredicts DMS concentra-\ntions in the polar waters of the Southern Ocean. This is most\nlikely due to an underprediction of DMSPp in this region\n(Figure 4c), which is potentially due to the absence of an\nexplicitly modeled group of the haptophyte Phaeocystis, a\nFigure 2. Comparison of the relative dominance of the three pPFTs with estimates from satellite obser-\nvations using (a) PHYSAT data [Alvain et al., 2005, 2006], (b) diatoms, (c and d) nanophytoplankton, and\n(e and f) coccolithophores.\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n8 of 21\ngroup known to be prolific DMS producers and to be\nabundant in the Southern Ocean. The modeled Southern\nOcean plankton community is dominated by diatoms, which\nare poor DMS producers [Keller et al., 1989]. Simulated\nDMS concentrations are in good agreement with the data in\nthe Indian Ocean, but PlankTOM5 underestimates DMS\nconcentrations in the Equatorial Pacific and the Northern\nNorth Atlantic. There is no comprehensive global database\nfor DMSPd and DMSPp concentrations, so a global com-\nparison of model and data is difficult. Both DMSPp and\nDMSPd, however, are within the range measured in the\nNorth Atlantic during the AMT programme [Bell et al.,\n2006], and modeled and observed DMSP concentrations\nare in agreement for the BATS Station (see analysis in\nsection 4.3.3).\n4.2.2. Zonal Mean DMS and Chlorophyll\n[35] We compare zonal mean distributions of DMS and\nchlorophyll from observations [Kettle and Andreae, 2000]\nwith our model results (Figure 5). Zonal variations in DMS\nare larger in the interpolated data (black line) than in the\nmodel. In particular, modeled zonal means for the standard\nrun (PlankTOM5\u2010SEP) are almost constant in the low\nlatitudes (Figure 5 (top), PlankTOM5\u2010SNEP see section 4.3).\nA Spearman rank correlation between observed zonal mean\nDMS (Figure 5 (bottom)) and observed zonal mean chlo-\nrophyll (smoothed using a Hanning filter [Blackman and\nTukey, 1959]) gives a correlation coefficient of r = 0.26,\nwhich is low due to the high variability in chlorophyll.\nHowever, the amplitudes of observed zonal mean chloro-\nphyll and DMS covary: Local maxima and minima in DMS\nand chlorophyll coincide spatially (e.g., around 70\u00b0S, 40 \u00b0S\nFigure 3.

Modeled chlorophyll (red line) is in good agreement\nwith observed chlorophyll for 70\u00b0S\u201340\u00b0N, but the model\nunderpredicts the chlorophyll concentrations in the NH,\nwhere coastal values strongly influence zonal mean chlo-\nrophyll. Despite the underprediction of chlorophyll between\n40\u00b0N\u201360\u00b0N, simulated DMS concentrations are consistent\nwith observations. The model cannot capture the differences\nin gradients between DMS and chlorophyll levels between\n40\u00b0N\u201360\u00b0N, which is clearly visible in the observations.\n[36] To compare model\u2010data agreement in terms of\nabsolute concentrations, we calculate the Spearman corre-\nlation coefficient between model and two DMS datasets\nfor the 95 percentile (values less than 6 nM) of surface DMS\n(1) binned in zonal average band of 10\u00b0 and (2) in 10\u00b0 \u00d7 20\u00b0\nboxes (latitude \u00d7 longitude). We use both the interpolated\nDMS data [Kettle and Andreae, 2000] and the Global Sur-\nface Sea (GSS) DMS Database (http:\/\/saga.pmel.noaa.gov\/\ndms\/), containing ca. 30,000 data points (1972\u20132003). The\ncorrelations for the zonal averages are reasonably good (r =\n0.62 for DMSPlankTOM vs. DMSKettle and r = 0.47 for\nDMSPlankTOM vs. DMSGSS), but they become considerably\nlower when the data is analysed using the 10\u00b0 \u00d7 20\u00b0 boxes\n(r = 0.34 for DMSPlankTOM vs. DMSKettle and r = 0.28 for\nDMSPlankTOM vs. DMSGSS, respectively). Hence, the model\nhas some skill when large regions with similar environ-\nmental properties are considered, but much less skill when\nregional properties matter more strongly for the averages.\n4.2.3. Parameter Sensitivity of the DMS Module\n[37] We now analyse the sensitivity of the DMS module\nto its parameters. To (From) each parameter of the DMS\nmodule, 50% of its absolute value is added (subtracted). The\nmodel is then run for four years from the equilibrated state\nand the results are compared with those from the control run\nfor the same year. We use the global annual surface mean\nDMS, DMSPd and DMSPp concentrations and study their\ndeviations in % from the original value (DMSc) upon per-\nturbation (DMSp) of one of the model parameters. The dif-\nferences are calculated as the integrated means of Dpn =\nDMSc\u0002DMSp\nDMSc\n* 100, with pn designating the n\nth parameter of the\nsulphur system (Table 1). For bacterial temperature depen-\ndence (ba(T) = dT; see equation (13)), we add (subtract) 0.5 to\n(from) the assumed Q10 value of 3, rather than multiplying\nFigure 4. Annual mean DMS surface concentration fields in nmol L\u22121 (nM) for (a) DMS from Kettle\nand Andreae [2000], (b) simulated DMS, (c) simulated DMSPp, and (d) simulated DMSPd from the\nstandard run of PlankTOM5 (PlankTOM5\u2010SEP).\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n10 of 21\nthe temperature dependence d directly by 1.5, because this\nparameters enters our equations to the power of T. There-\nfore, this strategy prevents biasing our sensitivity study\ntowards an artificially inflated sensitivity to this parameter.\nWe find that the response of the model is nearly symmetric\nwith respect to positive and negative perturbations in\nparameter space. Thus, we only discuss the results from\npositive perturbations in the following.\n[38] In the case of an increase of the parameters by 50%,\nDMS proves to be most sensitive to changes in the Q10 of\nbacterial activity (\u201374%), the cell quota of all 3 PFTs\n(+44%), and to changes of the exudation rate (+26%), as\nwell as to changes of the individual, PFT specific cell quota\n(+0.9%, +18% and +25%) and exudation rates (+0.1%, +9%\nand +16%) for diatoms, nanophytoplankton and cocco-\nlithophores, respectively. DMSPd surface concentrations are\nmost sensitive to changes in bacterial activity (\u201373%), a\nchange of all cell quota (+44%) and of the individual cell\nquota (+1%, +18% and +24%) for diatoms, nanophyto-\nplankton and coccolithophores, respectively. In addition, a\nchange of the bacterial half saturation constant for DMSPd\nconsumption leads to a change of +7% in the annual means.\nDMSPp is directly sensitive to changes in overall cell quota\n(+50%), and also to changes in the individual PFT\u2010specific\ncell quota (+2%, +22% and +26% for silicifiers, mixed\nphytoplankton and calcifiers, respectively). Indirectly,\nDMSPp is sensitive to an increase of bacterial temperature\ndependence (+33%), which leads to a slightly faster\nrecycling of nutrients and hence slightly increased algal\ngrowth. In order to visualize the order of importance for\nthe factors controlling their dynamics, we normalize DMS,\nDMSPp and DMSPd sensitivities to 100% (Figure 6), i.e.,\nQDpi =\njDpijPn\nj\u00bc1:n jDpjj\n.\n[39] The importance of the individual parameters is not\nconstant but varies strongly with latitude (not shown). The\nimportance of cell quota is linked to PFT distribution (more\nimportant for locations populated by mixed phytoplankton\nand coccolithophores containing large amounts of DMSP:C).\nExudation rates and the bacterial temperature dependence\nhave the highest impact on zonal mean DMS concentrations\nin the tropics. Bacterial temperature dependence is crucial\nfor the balance between mean DMS concentration levels\nin the high and temperate latitudes and those in the low\nlatitudes.\n4.3. DMS Seasonality and the Summer Paradox\n4.3.1. Seasonality of DMS, DMSPp, and DMSPd\n(Standard Run)\n[40] Figure 7 shows the seasonal cycle of simulated DMS\n(Figure 7a), DMSPp (Figure 7c) and DMSPd (Figure 7d)\nand total chlorophyll (Figure 7e) in a Hovm\u00f8ller diagram\n(time\u2010latitude plot), with DMS and chlorophyll compared to\nobservational data (Figures 7b and 7f; SeaWiFS [Kettle and\nAndreae, 2000]).

While DMS\nand chlorophyll are both elevated during the summer\nmonths in the high latitudes, there is no such correlation in\nthe low latitudes, where chlorophyll is almost constant.\n[41] On basin scale, the seasonal correlation (quantified\nby a Spearman rank correlation coefficient) between model\nand data [Kettle and Andreae, 2000] is high in the North\nAtlantic (r = 0.94), the North (r = 0.79) and Subtropical\nPacific (r = 0.81) and the Antarctic (r = 0.94) and Southern\nOcean (r = 0.69). DMS seasonality in the Southern Ocean\n(r = 0.69) is reasonable, even though the model cannot\nreproduce the high amplitude of the seasonal cycle if DMS\nobserved in the high latitudes. In general, correlations are\nlower in the equatorial regions than in the subtropical and\nhigh latitude oceans (Table 5). It is important to stress,\nhowever, that the uncertainty associated with the seasonal\ninterpolation of the data is variable, as it critically depends\non the wealth of data for each month and province [Kettle\net al., 1999].\n4.3.2. Mechanisms Causing the Decoupling of DMS\nand Chlorophyll Between 40\u00b0N and 40\u00b0S (Summer\nParadox)\n[42] The parameter sensitivity tests performed in section\n4.2.3 investigated the importance of the parameters of the\nDMS module for global annual mean DMS surface con-\ncentrations. In order to examine which processes control the\nglobal seasonality of DMS we show results from four sep-\narate runs, described in section 3.2 and listed in Table 2. In\nparticular, we focus on DMS seasonality in the low lati-\ntudes, where the summer paradox [Sim\u00f3 and Pedr\u00f3s\u2010Ali\u00f3,\n1999; Toole et al., 2003] has been observed. These tests\nnot only include variations in parameter space, but involve\nmodifications on the process level: Key processes which we\nidentified to be most important for DMS seasonality were\nswitched on and off. The results of the four models are\nsummarized in Table 4, and annual mean fields are shown in\nFigure 8.\n[43] The inclusion of a strong light dependence in\nPlankTOM5 (PlankTOM5\u2010SEP), as suggested by recent\nworks [Vallina et al., 2008; Vallina and Sim\u00f3, 2007],\nenables our model to correctly capture the phase of DMS\nseasonality in most regions of the ocean (Table 5). Figure 9a\nshows the Spearman correlation between modeled DMS and\ninterpolated observations from Kettle and Andreae [2000].\nBoth data sets are positively correlated over most regions of\nthe ocean, except for the equatorial regions of the Pacific\nand the Indian Ocean. Modeled and observed DMS are\nclosely correlated for the Southern Ocean, where correla-\ntions lie between 0.4 at ca. 50\u00b0S and 0.8\u20131.0 between 60\u00b0S\nand 70\u00b0S. Figure 9 also shows the correlations between\nmodel chlorophyll and DMS. In the SEP run, DMS and\nFigure 6.

This\nFigure 7. Seasonality in (a) DMS, (c) DMSPp, (d) DMSPd, and (e) chlorophyll, as simulated by DMS\u2010\nPlankTOM (SEP), compared to seasonality of interpolated (b) DMS field from Kettle and Andreae [2000]\nand (f) chlorophyll\u2010a from SeaWiFS. While there is only one maximum in DMS in the high latitudes\n(bloom regime), there are two DMS maxima in the low latitudes between 40\u00b0N and 40\u00b0S (stress regime).\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n13 of 21\nbehavior indicates the existence of two \u201cregimes\u201d in the\nocean [Toole and Siegel, 2004]: In the bloom\u2010dominated\nhigh latitudes, DMS and chlorophyll are closely temporally\ncorrelated [Sim\u00f3 and Dachs, 2002]. In the stress\u2010forced\nregime (low latitudes), DMS and chlorophyll dynamics are\nno longer in phase and DMS is strongly light dependent.\n[44] PlankTOM5\u2010SNEP includes a variable DMSPp cell\nquota, but does not include the DMS exudation term\n(Table 4). Both global annual and zonal mean DMS are\nin fairly good agreement with observation\u2010based means\nfrom [Kettle and Andreae, 2000] (Figure 5). However,\nPlankTOM5\u2010SNEP does not achieve substantial decoupling\nof DMS and chlorophyll in the low latitudes (Figures 9c\nand 9d). While cell quotas were variable by a factor of 4,\nthis was still not enough to produce significant decoupling\nin the low latitudes. In addition, DMSPp concentrations\nwere very high in this model (global annual mean: 32 nM,\nversus 12 nM for PlankTOM5\u2010SEP). For this run, DMS and\nchlorophyll were tightly coupled in most regions of the\nocean, except for a small zone of antiphasal behavior in the\nPacific.\n[45] PlankTOM5\u2010SENP (Figures 9e and 9f) assumes\nequal cell quotas for the 3 pPFTs, but allows the cell quota\nto vary with environmental stress (light and nutrient\navailability) and includes the direct DMS exudation term.\nThere is almost no difference between the correlations for\nPlankTOM5\u2010SEP and for this model. This finding points\neither at a reduced importance of an individual, PFT\u2010\ndependent cell quota when compared to the influence of\nlight for reproducing the summer paradox. Alternatively, the\nresults can be interpreted as an insufficient representation of\nPFT succession in PlankTOM5 (see section 5). Model\u2010data\nagreement for the annual means is worse for this run than\nfor PlankTOM\u2010SEP (Table 4).\n[46] In PlankTOM5\u2010NSENP (Figures 9g and 9h) all PFTs\nwere set to have identical and constant cell quota, with no\npossibility for an adaptation of the DMSPp cell quota to\nenvironmental stress. Here, the correlation between modeled\nDMS and DMS from the interpolated Kettle database\ndeteriorates, and modeled DMS and chlorophyll\u2010a are cou-\npled almost everywhere in the ocean.\n[47] We use the global mean Spearman correlation coef-\nficient rF between modeled and observed DMS seasonality\nas a means to rank the importance of the individual pro-\ncesses. This number can be used to estimate the relative\ncontribution of regions with positive and negative correla-\ntion. For PlankTOM5\u2010SEP, we find that rF = 0.35, for\nPlankTOM5\u2010SNEP rF = 0.05, for PlankTOM5\u2010SENP rF =\n0.33 and for PlankTOM5\u2010NSENP rF = 0.10. This means,\nthat in our model, exudation is the most important process to\ncorrectly simulate DMS seasonality, as its exclusion leads to\nthe largest deterioration in DrF = 0.3. The second most\nimportant process is the stress\u2010dependent cell quota. Finally,\nthe inclusion of a PFT\u2010specific minimal cell quota does not\nsignificantly deteriorate rF.\n4.3.3. Simulating DMS Seasonality at BATS\n[48] We evaluate the model at the Bermuda Atlantic Time\nSeries Station (BATS, 63.5\u00b0W, 32.4\u00b0N), where DMSPp,\nDMSPd and DMS patterns were continuously monitored\nbetween 1992 and 1993 [Dacey et al., 1998]. This site is\nknown to display the summer paradox [Sim\u00f3 and Pedr\u00f3s\u2010\nAli\u00f3, 1999; Toole et al., 2003; Dacey et al., 1998] and is\ntherefore a suitable test site for model seasonality.\n[49] The comparison of modeled and observed DMS\n(Figures 10a and 10b) shows that DMS surface concentra-\ntions are generally well matched by the model. The model\nexhibits a surface maximum (4\u20134.5 nM) in April, which is\nnot present in the observations. Hence, it does not simulate\nDMS production during the spring bloom accurately.\nHowever, there is a smaller, second surface DMS maximum\nin August (2.5\u20133 nM), where observed DMS concentrations\nare around 3.5\u20134 nM. In the vertical distribution, DMS\naccumulation is relatively low and observed maximal values\nof up to 6 nM are not captured in the model (up to 4 nM\nat depths of 30 m). The observed depth of the summer\nmaximum in DMS is well captured by the model (20\u201330 m),\nbut the magnitude of the subsurface maximum in DMS is\nunderestimated.\n[50] The magnitude of surface DMSPd concentrations of\nmodel and data are in reasonable agreement (Figures 10c\nand 10d), with observed DMSPd being 50\u2013100% higher\nthan modeled DMSPd for the summer months (June\u2013\nSeptember). Given known problems in the methodology\nfor the estimation of DMSPd concentrations using the\npurge\u2010and\u2010trap technique [Kiene and Slezak, 2006], the\nobservational data could be overestimated and should not be\noverinterpreted. Modeled surface DMSPd peaks in April\/\nMay and then again in August, whereas observed DMSPd is\nhigh during May\u2013August, and almost constant throughout\nthe water column.\n[51] DMSPp is overestimated in the model, in particular\nduring the spring months, where model concentrations rise\nup to 30 nM (Figures 10e and 10f). Observed DMSPp is\nonly about 12 nM at the surface and maximum DMSPp is\nreached at a depth of 50 m (16 nM). While the model\naccumulates DMSPp (10\u201315 nM) at 70\u201390 m depth during\nthe summer and autumn months, observed DMSPp is\nmaximal only in May and June and rapidly drops below\n10 nM for the entire water column.\n[52] Total chlorophyll is compared in Figures 10g and\n10h. The model overpredicts chlorophyll during the spring\nbloom, and it underpredicts the deep chlorophyll maximum\nduring the summer months at 80 m depth. In particular, the\nTable 5.

This points at the importance of a variable\nDMSPp cell quota at BATS, as highlighted by Le Clainche\net al. [2004]. In PlankTOM5, we could not achieve\ndecoupling of DMS and chlorophyll\u2010a through a variable\ncell quota only.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. DMS Concentrations and Global DMS Seasonality\n[53] Our model simulates the concentrations of DMS,\nDMSPd and DMSPp within the global ocean biogeochem-\nistry model PlankTOM5, which includes 3 pPFTs and\n2 zPFTs. In contrast to other models [e.g., Six and Maier\u2010\nReimer, 2006], this model was tuned to better represent\nDMS seasonality for the global ocean, while still giving\nrealistic global and zonal mean concentrations. In the model,\nDMS seasonality in the temperate and high latitudes is\ndriven by phytoplankton biomass, where DMS and chloro-\nphyll are coupled. The inclusion of an explicit light\u2010\ndependent term [Sunda et al., 2002; Vallina et al., 2008]\nleads to a decoupling of DMS and chlorophyll in the tropics\nand to a better representation of global DMS seasonality.\nHence, the model shows two distinct regimes, a \u201cbloom\u2010\nforced regime\u201d and a \u201cstress\u2010forced regime,\u201d as postulated\nby Toole and Siegel [2004].\n[54] A classical parameter sensitivity test (section 4.2.3)\nshowed that simulated global annual mean DMS con-\ncentrations are particularly sensitive to the internal DMSP\nFigure 8. Annual mean DMS fields (nM) for the four test runs: (a) standard run, PlankTOM5\u2010SEP;\n(b) PlankTOM5\u2010SNEP; (c) PlankTOM5\u2010SENP; and (d) PlankTOM5\u2010NSENP.

Observed and modeled DMS are\nmore strongly positively correlated in the low latitudes in Figures 9a and 9e. Accordingly, the observed\ndecoupling between DMS and chlorophyll between 40\u00b0N and 40\u00b0S (summer paradox [Toole et al.,\n2003]) is captured better by the model in Figures 9b and 9f than in Figures 9d and 9h.\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n16 of 21\ncell quota and the DMS exudation rates. Furthermore, global\nmean DMS concentrations respond strongly to bacterial\nparameters such as the bacterial temperature dependence.\nOther models confirm the importance of these key parameters:\nSix and Maier\u2010Reimer [2006] find that bacterial activity is\ncrucial for DMS concentration patterns, and the importance\nof bacterial parameters has also been confirmed in 1\u2010D\nstudies [Vallina et al., 2008]. Several other models agree\nthat cell quota are a key parameter for model results [Lef\u00e8vre\net al., 2002; Le Clainche et al., 2004; Vallina et al., 2008].\n[55] Model simulations with a variable DMS cell quota\nbut no external light driven terms led to the best fit regarding\nzonal annual mean concentrations, but in the low latitudes\nDMS seasonality was out of phase with observations. This\neffect may result from the data treatment applied by Kettle\nand Andreae [2000]: The authors used information on bio-\ngeochemical provinces (and hence chlorophyll concentra-\ntion levels) to generate interpolated DMS fields. This\napproach will influence observation\u2010based zonal means and\ncouple them more strongly to chlorophyll\u2010a. Alternatively,\nzonal mean DMS may be intrinsically linked to observed\nchlorophyll levels, so that total biomass controls the baseline\nlevel for mean DMS concentrations.\n[56] PlankTOM5 is one of the first global prognostic\nmodels that is capable of simulating global DMS seasonality\ncorrectly. Some other global prognostic DMS models can-\nnot simulate the summer paradox [Six and Maier\u2010Reimer,\n2006; Kloster et al., 2006; Aumont and Bopp, 2006]. The\nmodel described by Chu et al. [2003] is capable of a certain\ndecoupling, but it uses location\u2010dependent DMS generation\nformulae. We now combine several stressors, and use only\none set of equations for the entire ocean.\nFigure 10. Comparison of (left) modeled (from PlankTOM5\u2010SEP) and (right) observed (a and b) DMS,\n(c and d) DMSPd, (e and f) DMSPp, and (g and h) chlorophyll from the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series\nStations (BATS) at depths of 0\u2013100 m.

DMS and the Summer Paradox\n[57] We tested the relative importance of phytoplankton\nsuccession, changes in the DMSP cell quota and the direct\nrelease of DMS from light\u2010stressed phytoplankton cells for\nDMS seasonality in the tropics. We find that exudation is\nthe most important process for DMS seasonality in the low\nlatitudes, and that a variable cell quota is more important\nthan a PFT\u2010specific cell quota. In PlankTOM5, light is the\ndominant driver for DMS seasonality in the low latitudes,\nand phytoplankton biomass drives DMS seasonality in the\nmid\u2010 and high latitudes.\n[58] Given that PlankTOM5 currently only comprises of\n3 pPFTs, it is premature to conclude that ecosystem com-\nposition is of minor importance for DMS seasonality.\nEspecially at low latitudes, the ecosystem of PlankTOM5 is\nmostly dominated by the group of the mixed phytoplankton,\nwhile diatoms occur predominantly at high latitudes. Calci-\nfiers dominate in defined zonal bands in the NH. Hence, the\nmodeled ocean is dominated by one or two types of phyto-\nplankton over large regions of the globe. This restricts the\npotential influence of species succession and ecosystem\ncomposition on DMS patterns.\n[59] Local 1\u2010D models achieved decoupling either\nthrough a light\u2010dependent DMSP cell quota [Lef\u00e8vre et al.,\n2002; Le Clainche et al., 2004] or through the introduction\nof direct DMS generation terms from algal cells [Vallina\net al., 2008; Toole et al., 2008]. In our global model, a\nchange in cell quota alone as a response to light stress in\nconjunction with species succession was not sufficient to\nreach a satisfactory decoupling in the low latitudes. In par-\nticular, the model only produces a summer paradox at BATS\nafter the introduction of an exudation term.\n[60] Whether DMS dynamics in the low latitudes are\ndriven by exudation, i.e., the active or passive transport of\nDMS across the cell membrane, or by another process with\na similar signature, e.g., the phytoplanktonic cleavage of\nDMSPd by (extracellular) DMSP lyase [Niki et al., 2000] or\nbacterial and bacteria\u2010mediated process, is not yet certain.\nAt present, the experimental evidence for exudation is\nscarce [see, e.g., Stefels et al., 2007]. The importance of\nbacterial processes for DMS seasonality has not been eval-\nuated in this study, due to the coarseness of our represen-\ntation of bacterial dynamics. Several bacterial processes\nhave been found to be light sensitive, and may contribute to\nthe summer paradox: Bacterial consumption of DMS is\ninhibited at high light intensities [Slezak et al., 2001], the\nmicrobial yield of DMS from DMSP can vary with bacterial\nsulphur demand, which may be dependant on UV stress\n[Sim\u00f3 and Pedr\u00f3s\u2010Ali\u00f3, 1999; Kiene et al., 2000]. These\nprocesses may explain parts of the summer paradox.\n5.3. Model Results at the BATS Site\n[61] It is important to note that our model was not\ndeveloped to fit the time series at the Bermuda Atlantic\nTime Series Station. We constructed the model to better\nreproduce global seasonality of DMS concentrations at all\nlatitudes, and DMS(P) values at BATS were only evaluated\na posteriori after model development was finalized. A global\n3\u2010D model with its coarse grid is not optimally suited to\naccurately resolve the dynamics at one specific location.\nHowever, the time series data allows to test whether\nPlankTOM5 can resolve the depth structure of the seasonal\nDMS cycle. As can be seen in Figure 9, the Sargasso Sea is\none of the regions where we do not yet achieve a complete\ndecoupling between DMS and chlorophyll values. Given\nthat a 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 mean is compared to point measurements in a\nregion where a strong influence of small scale physics\n(eddies) has been shown to play an important role [Le\nClainche et al., 2004; Bailey et al., 2008], the agreement\nbetween model and measurement is reasonable.\n[62] Observations at BATS point at a phase lag between\nsurface DMSPp and surface chlorophyll, which the model\ndoes not reproduce well, despite the fact that we model\nvariable DMSP cell quotas. Variable DMSP cell quotas\ncould enable decoupling, if reduced sinks allowed a stronger\naccumulation of DMS, and if ecosystem composition and\nsuccession were well represented. We achieve a certain\ndegree of decoupling between DMS and chlorophyll\nthrough the introduction of an exudation term, which sup-\nports findings by Vallina and Sim\u00f3 [2007] and Vallina et al.\n[2008]. However, Le Clainche et al. [2004] reach a best\nmodel data fit for BATS through a variable DMSP cell\nquota without direct DMS exudation. Hence, other pro-\ncesses may be responsible for parts of the observed patterns.\n[63] The simulation of the dynamics in a real marine\necosystem is challenging for any model containing only a\nlimited number of PFTs. At BATS, phytoplanktonic com-\nmunity composition has been found to be dominated by\ncyanobacteria [Andersen et al., 1996; Goericke, 1998;\nSteinberg et al., 2001]. In the model, however, the spring\nbloom at BATS is dominated by diatoms and coccolitho-\nphores, whereas the dominant observed groups at BATS\nalmost exclusively belong to our mixed PFT. In contrast to\nnanophytoplankton, cyanobacteria tend to be poor DMS\nproducers. While the overestimation of DMSPp during the\nspring bloom is due to the overestimation in phytoplank-\ntonic biomass, the underestimation of DMS during the\nsummer is likely due to a suboptimal modelization of\nDMSPd and DMS sinks and the microbial loop.\n6. Summary and Conclusion\n[64] We have built a global DMS model that takes into\naccount DMS production and degradation mechanisms\ndependent on external factors such as environmental tem-\nperature and insolation. The model reproduces global sea-\nsonality of DMS and partly captures the summer paradox\nobserved between 40\u00b0N and 40\u00b0S. Our model results sug-\ngest that DMS seasonality in the low latitudes is driven by\nlight, and by phytoplankton biomass in the high latitudes.\nZonal and global mean DMS appear to be sensitive to\necosystem composition and phytoplankton biomass. In our\nmodel, the improvement of DMS seasonality leads to the\ndeterioration of the zonal mean concentrations, and it is not\nyet clear whether this is an artifact of the data treatment, or\nwhether this finding is an indication that exudation, or a\nprocess with a similar signature, acts in concert with other\nprocesses, leading to a superposition of zonal and seasonal\ndynamics.\n[65] Here, we focus on the relative importance of eco-\nsystem composition and dynamics and light stress for the\nseasonality of DMS at different latitudes, and chose\nexudation as one possible process by which algal DMS\nVOGT ET AL.: DMS IN PLANKTOM5 C06021C06021\n18 of 21\nproduction can be made light dependent. Several other\nmechanisms to explain the summer paradox have been\nproposed, such as a species succession from low to high\nDMS\u2010producing phytoplankton, the inhibition of bacterial\nDMS degradation under UV stress, or a variation in bacterial\nsulphur demand. One major caveat of PlankTOM5 is the\ncoarse parameterization of bacterial dynamics. More com-\nprehensive studies are needed that study the role of the\nmicrobial loop for the summer paradox. While our current\nstudy confirms the importance of light, it is still possible that\nother, unmodeled processes with a similar signature to our\nexudation pathway account for (parts of) the summer para-\ndox. Future modeling studies should use DGOMs with a\ncomplexity higher than the one of PlankTOM5 (must\ninclude bacteria) and should address all possible processes\nthat can lead to the decoupling of DMS and chlorophyll in\nthe low latitudes. In particular, it is necessary to quantify the\nrelative importance of bacteria\u2010mediated process and phy-\ntoplanktonic processes. Furthermore, it is still difficult to\nsimulate biogeographic patterns with only 3 pPFTs. DMS\ndynamics and concentration patterns are highly sensitive to\nmany ecosystem processes across trophic levels. DMS can\nserve as a test compound for the next generation of DGOMs,\nif key PFTs, such as Phaeocystis are included. While we do\nnot find pPFT distribution to be highly important for DMS\nseasonality in this work, other authors have been able to\nreproduce DMS seasonality at BATS without resorting to\nexudation [Le Clainche et al., 2004]. Hence, it is premature\nto conclude that ecosystem composition is of minor\nimportance for DMS concentration patterns.\n[66] Acknowledgments.
