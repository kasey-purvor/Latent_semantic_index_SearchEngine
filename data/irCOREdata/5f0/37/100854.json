Spectroscopic\nproperties and configuration assignments of several new high-K isomers are compared with earlier theoretical\npredictions. A striking example of the robustness of the K quantum number is demonstrated by the observed\ncompetition between E1 and E3 decay modes in 180Hf, the heaviest stable isotope of the element.\n@S0556-2813~99!50503-7#\nPACS number~s!: 21.10.Tg, 23.20.Lv, 27.70.1q, 29.30.KvThe conditions under which K , the projection of the\naligned nucleonic spins on the symmetry axis in deformed\nnuclei @1#, is a good quantum number remain a topic of much\ncurrent interest. On the one hand, there are striking examples\nof K conservation at high spins, such as the Kp5161 isomer\nin 178Hf, with t1\/2531 yr @2#. On the other, experiments with\nthe new generation of detector arrays have isolated multi-\nquasiparticle ~multi-qp! K isomers in the A'180 region with\nunexpectedly fast decay rates, suggesting a severe break-\ndown of K-selection rules @3,4#. Clearly, a systematic study\nof the properties of K isomers as a function of different\nparameters, such as the number of quasiparticles in the iso-\nmeric configuration, the spin and excitation energy of the\nisomers, and the magnitude of the K quantum number are\nneeded, preferably over a wide range of N\/Z ratios, from the\nmost neutron-deficient to the most neutron-rich nuclei.\nThe Hf(Z572) isotopic chain is rich in K isomers, due to\na robust axial symmetry and the availability of multiple\nhigh-V orbitals near the Fermi surface. High-K isomers have\nlong been predicted in isotopes heavier than 180Hf @5#, the\nheaviest stable Hf isotope. Experimental information to date\non neutron-rich Hf nuclei, however, has been limited, prima-PRC 590556-2813\/99\/59~3!\/1227~5!\/$15.00rily because fusion reactions with stable beam-target combi-\nnations are unable to populate neutron-rich nuclei beyond the\nline of b stability. Recent advances with inelastic and trans-\nfer reactions in populating high spins in target- and\nprojectile-like fragments @6\u201310# have motivated our current\ninvestigation of high-K isomers in the A'180 region using\nthese techniques. Our pilot experiment, with pulsed 238U\nbeams on the heaviest stable isotopes of Lu(Z571), Ta(Z\n573), and W(Z574), was very successful in populating\nnew multi-qp isomers in the target nuclei @10#. This article\npresents the results of our follow-up experiments with\nHf(Z572) targets, where inelastic excitation and transfer\nmechanisms were used to populate several new 4-qp K iso-\nmers in a 180Hf target, as well as other new K isomers in\nneutron-rich Hf nuclei. Prior to our present study, only very\nlong-lived 2-qp 82 isomers were known in the even-even\n180,182,184Hf nuclei, the first two from b-decay studies @2#,\nand the last one from a recent experiment using a transfer\nreaction @11#.\nIn our primary experiment, thick targets of isotopically\nenriched 180Hf (;40 mg\/cm2) and natural Hf ~;6 mg\/cm2,\nwhich contains 25% 180Hf!, each backed by enough 208Pb toR1227 \u00a91999 The American Physical Society\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nR1228 PRC 59R.

The beam, which has a natural separation of\n82.5 ns between nanosecond pulses, was switched on and off\nby a sweeper in three different time periods of 1.65, 165, and\n1650 ms, with an on\/off ratio of 1\/4. Only delayed g rays\nwere recorded in the beam-off periods by the Argonne-Notre\nDame BGO array of 12 Compton-suppressed Ge detectors\nwith a master trigger of at least one Ge firing in the beam-off\ninterval. Isomer decay schemes were constructed from g-g\ncoincidence events recorded in all three time ranges. The\ntime between the master trigger and the sweeper was also\nrecorded for each event, and used to measure the half-lives\nof individual g rays. In addition to this primary experiment,\nthe results were clarified and extended by more recent data\nobtained in conjunction with tests of the Gammasphere array\n@12# operated with the beam sweeper at ATLAS, where a 1.3\nGeV 208Pb beam was incident on the 180Hf target for a few\nhours. The Pb beam was swept in intervals of 20 ms on and\n25 ms off, with data collected as before during the beam-off\nperiods. The decay schemes of 180Hf, 181Hf, and 182Hf nuclei\ndeduced from the present experiment are shown in Fig. 1.\nRepresentative g-g coincidence data and time spectra are\npresented in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. All the rotational\nband structures observed in this study are populated from\nhigher-lying isomers, since only delayed g rays were re-\ncorded. A total of six new isomers are observed in the three\nnuclei, of which four involve four quasiparticles. Three of\nthe four are assigned to 180Hf and one to 182Hf. New prop-\nerties of these isomers in the even-even 180,182Hf nuclei are\nsummarized in Table I, and discussed in detail below.\nThe most intensely populated new isomer in this study\ndecays with a half-life of 1061 ms to a previously unob-served, regularly spaced rotational band, with the transitions\nin the band coincident with Hf x rays @Fig. 2~b!#. When the\nnatHf target is replaced by the 180Hf target, the g rays in this\nrotational band are the strongest ones that persist in the spec-\ntrum ~other than the ground-state band members of 180Hf\npopulated in the decay of the known 2-qp 82 isomer, t1\/2\n55.5 h!. Although coincidence events are not measurable\nacross the 5.5 h half-life, the most logical placement of the\nnew band is on top of the 82 isomer. The transitions in the\nband, which are almost certainly of M1 and E2 character, in\nline with the properties of strongly coupled bands in axially\ndeformed nuclei, adhere well to the systematics of rotational\nFIG. 2.

This observation\nlimits the spin of the isomer to either 11 or 12. The signifi-\ncantly weaker ~1%! decay branch to the 102 state argues\nagainst a J511 assignment for the isomer.

The 121\nassignment is also strengthened by a comparison with esti-\nmates of multi-qp excitation energies from blocked-BCS\u2013\ntype calculations @13# for a 121 state with a p282 ^ n242\nconfiguration ~see Table I!, though the precision of the\nagreement to within a keV is purely fortuitous.\nThe competition of a multipolarity l53 transition with a\nl51 transition is a classic example of K-selection rules, and\nhighlights the robustness of the K quantum number in this\ncase. Transitions between states with different K values are\nforbidden to first order if DK.l . Such forbidden transitions\nare observed due to higher order corrections from small ad-\nmixtures of other K components in the wave functions of the\ninitial and final states. The degree of forbiddenness is defined\nas n5DK2l , and the reduced hindrance ~or hindrance fac-\ntor per degree of K forbiddenness! as f n5@ t1\/2exp\/t1\/2W #1\/n, where\nt1\/2\nexp is the experimentally measured partial half-life of the\ng-ray transition, and t1\/2\nW is the Weisskopf single-particle es-\ntimate of the half-life. Since the K512 isomer decays to a\nK58 band, DK54, which results in values of n53 for the\nE1 and n51 for the E3 transition. The E3 transition is thus\nless K hindered than the E1 decay and able to compete. With\nthe decay branching ratios and measured half-life for the 121\nisomer, f n5136 for the E3 branch, and 107 for the E1 tran-\nsition ~using a 1024 retardation that is typically factored into\nthe E1 Weisskopf estimate for comparison with other mul-\ntipolarities!. The reduced hindrance for the E3 transition is\nconsistent with those observed in other Hf nuclei for 3- and\n4-qp isomers. This clean example bolsters the scant experi-\nmental systematics of K hindrances for E3 transitions in this\nmass region.\nIn addition to the 10 ms primary half-life, all the transi-\ntions observed in the decay of the 121 isomer show a longer\nhalf-life component ~Fig. 3!, which establishes that this iso-\nmeric state is being fed by a higher-lying isomer ~or iso-\nmers!. A two-lifetime fit incorporating this feeding scenario\nyields a t1\/2'100 ms for this longer component. Based on the\ndata from our primary experiment, it was difficult to isolate\nclean candidate feeder g rays for the 121 isomer. The more\nrecent data from Gammasphere ~GS! helped clarify and\nstrengthen this part of the level scheme, since weak coinci-\ndence relationships were observable across the 10 ms isomer,\ndue to the wider ('1 ms) overlap criterion in the GS trigger\nelectronics. A g-g-g coincidence cube of out-of-beam de-\nlayed g rays from the GS data set was used to analyze\ndouble-gated spectra. This proved to be crucial, as a signifi-\ncant fraction of the new g rays were found to be energy\ndoublets with stronger transitions in the same nucleus. The\nnew group of g rays thus isolated was then analyzable in our\noriginal data with U beams. Contaminant-free g rays feeding\nthe 121 isomer have a measured half-life t1\/2590610 ms,\nand the '10% measured intensity in these feeding transi-\ntions is consistent with the intensity of the longer half-life\ncomponent observed for the decay g rays of the 121 isomer.\nThe GS data set also reveals the presence of a third new\nisomer, with t1\/251565 ms, in 180Hf at an excitation energy\nof 2427 keV. The decay pattern to the rotational states built\non the 82 bandhead points to a tentative (101) assignment,\nwhich also agrees within 40 keV with theoretical predictions\nfor the 2-quasineutron configuration n9\/21@624#^ n11\/21@615# . The low population intensity, which is ex-\npected from the non-yrast character of the isomer ~772 keV\nabove the yrast 102 state!, does not provide sufficient statis-\ntics for a precise half-life measurement.\nThe analysis of the g rays feeding the 10 ms isomer,\nthrough intensity balances and a comparison with theoretical\npredictions, leads to tentative spin-parity assignments for this\npart of the level scheme. For example, the conversion coef-\nficient for the 151-keV g ray depopulating the isomer is mea-\nsured from intensity balance to be 966, which constrains the\nmultipolarity to either a M2 or an E3. The M2 assignment,\nbased on the general rule of choosing the lowest reasonable\nmultipole, leads to a tentative 182 assignment for the 90 ms\nisomer, with a proposed configuration of p282 ^ n2101 from\ncomparison with calculations ~see Table I!. This assignment\nis further strengthened by the observation of the n2101 iso-\nmer as described above. The measured excitation energies of\nthe constituent 2-qp states add up to within 30 keV of the\nobserved (182) isomer. A 4-qp yrast 182 isomer with this\nconfiguration has long been predicted in this nucleus @5#.\nThe triples coincidence data from GS also isolated a new\nisomeric state located 52 keV above the 121 isomer, presum-\nably with t1\/2@10 ms, since no coincidences are observable\nacross this isomer, even with the '1 ms overlap criterion in\nthe GS trigger electronics. No direct 52-keV transition would\nbe observable in the GS experiment, as g rays below\n'100 keV were severely attenuated by absorbers that were\nin place in front of the Ge detectors in this unoptimized test\nrun. A 52-keV transition would also be extremely difficult to\nobserve in our primary experiment with U beams, due to the\npresence of strong 55-keV Hf x-ray peaks in the spectra.\nHowever, such a 52-keV transition would be from an iso-\nmeric initial state to an isomeric final state, i.e., it would be\na cascade with multiplicity 1. In our U beam data, a spectrum\nobtained by dividing a spectrum of multiplicity >1 by one\nof multiplicity >2 shows a strong peak at 52 keV, together\nwith peaks at other well-known multiplicity-1 transitions,\nsuch as the 1461-keV radioactivity line in 40K. Theoretical\ncalculations @14# predict a 122 and a 141 level as the two\nprimary candidates for the next higher isomer above the 121\nisomer. The long half-life of the 52-keV transition eliminates\na 122 assignment, since no K hindrance would be present for\nthe E1 transition in that case. A 141 assignment would make\nthe 52-keV g ray a K-allowed E2 transition, with a half-life\nconsistent with the systematics of highly converted\nK-allowed E2 transitions in this mass region, such as a 97-\nkeV transition in 176Hf from a K522 isomer with t1\/2\n543 ms @2#, and an 86-keV transition in 177Ta from a K\n549\/2 isomer with t1\/25133 ms @15#. A tentative spin-parity\nof 141 is, therefore, proposed for this isomer.\nIn addition to the multiple isomers populated in the target\nnucleus, new isomers were observed in the neutron-rich Hf\nnuclei via neutron transfer. A new 1-qp isomer, with t1\/2\n58065 ms is placed in 181Hf at an excitation energy of 594\nkeV, from direct coincidence relationships with g rays in the\nrotational band built on the 1\/22@510# orbital, which was\nextended from the highest spin previously known @2# of J\n57\/2 to J511\/2 in this work. The intensities of the decay\nbranches from the isomer to the 7\/2, 9\/2, and 11\/2 members\nof this band limit the isomer spin assignment to either 9\/2 or\n11\/2. A 9\/21 assignment agrees with a previous tentative\nassignment of a n9\/21@624# configuration to a state observed\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nPRC 59 R1231HIGH-K ISOMERS IN NEUTRON-RICH HAFNIUM . . .in (t ,p) reactions @16# at an excitation energy of 600\n65 keV. A J511\/2 value would require a negative parity\nassignment in order to account for the intensity distribution\nin the observed decay branches, and the only possible\nnegative-parity quasineutron orbital of 11\/22@505# is ex-\npected to be located at a much higher excitation energy from\nsystematics.\nThere is also evidence for the population of a new 4-qp\nisomer in the neutron-rich 182Hf nucleus via two-neutron\ntransfer. The isomer, with t1\/2540610 ms, decays to a\nstrongly coupled rotational cascade, which we again infer to\nconsist of M1 and E2 transitions. The energy of each of the\nfour M1 transitions in this cascade is exactly 3 keV greater\nthan the corresponding transitions in the strong band placed\non top of the 82 isomeric level in 180Hf. The intensities of\nthese new transitions are a factor of 30 lower than the cor-\nresponding transitions in the 82 band of 180Hf, and are too\nweak for unambiguous identification via x rays. The same\nintensity ratio of 30 is observed between the g rays which\ndepopulate the known 2-qp 82 isomers in 182Hf and 180Hf\nnuclei. Based on the above evidence, the rotational band\nis placed on top of the known 82 isomer in 182Hf. The\nu(gK2gR)\/Q0u values deduced from the measured M1\/E2\nbranching ratios are in excellent agreement with the constant\nvalue expected from the same 2-quasiproton assignment to\nthe 82 bandhead as in 180Hf ~see Table I!. The energy sys-\ntematics of rotational band structures built on 2-qp 82 iso-\nmers in even-even Hf nuclei are shown in Fig. 4. Again, the\nmeasured branching ratios provide the first evidence for the\nconfiguration and for the K58 assignment to the previously\nknown 82 isomer in 182Hf @2#. A tentative spin-parity assign-\nment of 131 to the isomer from the decay pattern agrees well\nwith theoretical calculations for a p282 ^ n252 configura-\ntion ~see Table I!. The single decay branch observed from\nthe isomer is consistent with an E1 multipolarity assignment\nfor this 264-keV transition. The measured half-life then leads\nto a reduced hindrance of f n524, again factoring in a typical\n1024 retardation into the E1 Weisskopf estimate, as de-\nscribed above. This makes the (131) level in 182Hf the first\n4-qp K isomer in the A'180 region observed in a neutron-\nrich nucleus beyond the line of b-stability. It is worth noting\nthat the known 2-qp 82 isomer in 184Hf @11# is also observed\nin the GS data via four-neutron transfer, with approximatelya factor of 50 lower counts than the two-neutron transfer\nchannel, as seen in double-gated spectra of analogous transi-\ntions.\nThe observed excitation energies of the 2- and 4-qp iso-\nmers are compared in Table I to predictions, where the en-\nergies are calculated with the blocked BCS method @13#,\nwithout explicit inclusion of residual interactions. The effec-\ntive pairing strengths of G(n)521\/nucleon MeV and G(p)\n522\/nucleon MeV give realistic estimates for like-nucleon\nspin-singlet couplings ~with favored residual interactions!\nbut spin-triplet energies may be underestimated. It is inter-\nesting to note that almost all the new isomers observed are\nfavored configurations. This like-nucleon spin-singlet cou-\npling is especially evident in the 4-qp isomers involving the\nn1\/22@510# orbital in both 180Hf and 182Hf, where the two\nquasineutrons couple to Kmax21, in order to take advantage\nof the spin-singlet configuration. The Kmax513 configuration\nhad seemed to be the lower state in 180Hf in earlier calcula-\ntions @14#, where only Kmax couplings had been calculated.\nWe now observe the K512 level instead as the isomer. Us-\ning the empirical values of the residual interactions from the\nsame reference @14#, the K512 state is lowered by\n'200 keV compared to the Kmax513 configuration, thus\nproviding a consistent understanding of the experimental\ndata.\nIn summary, we have populated and measured spectro-\nscopic properties of 4-qp K isomers in neutron-rich nuclei at\nand beyond the line of b stability in the A'180 region, using\ninelastic excitations and transfer mechanisms. Configuration\nand K assignments have been proposed for previously ob-\nserved 2-qp isomers, based on M1\/E2 branching ratios mea-\nsured in rotational bands observed in the present work to\nfeed these 2-qp states. A classic example of the robustness of\nthe K quantum number is demonstrated by competing E1\nand E3 transitions from a 4-qp isomer in 180Hf. These tech-\nniques can be extended to study multi-qp yrast isomers in\nneutron-rich nuclei at higher angular momenta by using the\nhighest efficiency arrays currently available, such as GS and\nEuroball.\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of En-\nergy, Nuclear Physics Division, under contracts DE-FG02-\n94ER40848 and W-31-109-ENG-38, and by the U.K. Engi-\nneering and Physical Sciences Research Council.@1# A.
