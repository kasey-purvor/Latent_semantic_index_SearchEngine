INTRODUCTION\nFluorescent lighting takes a major role in today's lighting\nrequirements (with around 1.2 billion units being produced\nper year) due to benefits afforded by crisp white light\noutput compared to traditional incandescent and high\nintensity discharge lamps. Fluorescent lamps also provide\na higher Lumens\/Watt output, and higher efficiency,\nparticularly when excited at high frequencies, typically 30-\n50kHz, by virtue of there being insufficient time between\neach half cycle of the supply for a significant number of\nmercury ions in the discharge to re-combine (and thereby\nnecessitating a re-strike), as occurs with standard mains\nfrequency excitation, for instance.\nThe affect of this non-linear frequency dependence of lamp\nvoltage and current can be clearly seen from a comparison\nof Figs. l(a) & l(b), which show the voltage vs. current\nrelationship for an 8W, 60cm, T5 fluorescent tube excited\nby 50Hz and 50kHz input voltage, respectively.\n50\n40\n30-\n20-\n10\n0 -\n-10\n-30 -\n-40 -\n.4 -03 -02 -01 0 01 02 03 04\nLamp Current (A)\n(a)\n-4U 03 020 02II\n_-0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -01 0 01 0.2 0.3 0.4\nLamp Curret (A)\n(b)\nFigure 1 Lamp voltage vs. current (a) 50Hz excitation (b) 50kHz\nexcitation\nThe relative 'loop area' shows that less re-combination\noccurs within the lamp between each half cycle of the input\nvoltage when high frequency excitation is employed.\nTypically, fluorescent lamps are constructed with an oxide\ncoated, tungsten filament electrode. Passing current\nthrough the electrode prior to striking to heat it (termed pre-\nheating) lowers the electrode work function, thereby\nallowing electrons to be emitted more readily. This\nconsequently allows the lamp to strike at lower voltage than\nwould normally be required, which in-turn reduces damage\nto the electrode from ion bombardment during the ignition\nevent. Despite electrode pre-heating, however, the most\ncommon lamp failure mechanism is due to breakdown of\nthe coating on the electrodes, giving rise to a blackening at\none end of the tube and the lamp subsequently acting with\nsimilar characteristics to that of a gas diode. To circumvent\nthis problem, and ultimately increase lamp lifetime,\nelectrode-less lamps have been developed with various\ntechniques being employed to sustain the arc viz. RF\ninduction and capacitive discharge [1], and usually require\nexcitation frequencies in the MHz range. Along with\nincreasing lifetime, electrode-less excitation also removes\nthe loss associated with the electrode heating, and therefore\nencourages higher operating efficiency. Such lamps (for\nexample the GE Genura 23W commercially available\ninduction coupled lamp) are increasingly becoming a\npreferred candidate for inaccessible environments viz: high\nceiling sports halls requiring low maintenance etc. A\ndemonstrator capacitively coupled lamp, 8W, 60cm, T5\nfluorescent tube coupled to a ballast via copper tape applied\nto the outside of the tube, is shown in Fig. 2(a). To provide\n1-4244-0645-5\/07\/$20.00\u00a92007 IEEE\n40\n30\n20\n-2\n139\nignition and sustained light output from the lamp, an\nelectronic ballast must develop sufficiently high voltage,\ntypically between 400V and OOOV for striking, and\nsubsequently provide current limiting to promote stable\noperation. The latter issue is a key motivator for adopting\nresonant converters for fluorescent lamp ballasts, since,\nafter striking, the lamp exhibits a negative incremental\nimpedance characteristic, as shown in Fig. 2(b) & (c) for an\n8W lamp with an ignition voltage of 270V. The series\nimpedance of resonant converters naturally acts to counter\nthis destabilizing characteristic and encourage steady\ncontinuous operation. When operating without electrodes,\nthe requirement for high frequency excitation also has the\nadditional advantage of reducing the volume envelope\nrequirements of the reactive components of the ballast,\nalthough this is at the expense of significantly complicating\nthe design of the ballast since circuit behaviour can become\ndominated by parasitic elements.\nElectronic ballasts with half-bridge series resonant inverters\nare relatively straightforward to design, and have been\nwidely reported e.g [2, 3, 4], along with the more\ncomplicated 3rd-order LCC inverter variants [5]. More\ngenerically, however, for applications that are battery\npowered or require battery backup facilities, for instance, a\nlow DC input voltage must be 'boosted' for lamp ignition\nthrough the incorporation of a step-up transformer [6].\n2500-\nCD(\n2000\n_c\nC,)\n.Un\nCD 1500\na)E\n() 500\na)\n0 72 6 8\nLamp power (W)\n(b)\n10 12\n70\nao\n65\nQ 60\nE 55\n-5\n50,\n0.05 0.1 0.15\nLamp current (A)\n(c)\n0.2 0.25\nFigure 2 Capacitively coupled fluorescent lamp (a) Lamp and inverter\n(b) Measured lamp resistance against power (c) Measured voltage and\ncurrent characteristics\nThe subsequent effects of the high-frequency transformer's\nmagnetising inductance and inter-winding capacitance, are\nthen best represented by a model of a 4th-order LCLC\nresonant inverter. The widespread adoption of such high-\norder resonant inverters, however, has been impeded by the\nhigher peak electrical stresses to which individual\nelectronic components are exposed (compared to hard-\nswitched inverter counterparts), and the lack of suitable\ndesign methodologies that can provide an accurate and\nrapid analysis of the circuit at the design stage; particularly\nthose that consider the significant effects that parasitic\nresistances, capacitances and inductances have on the\nresonant tank behaviour.\nThese difficulties have prompted researchers to investigate\ntechniques for the reliable analysis and design of resonant\ninverters. Time domain mathematical models used to\ndescribe compact fluorescent ballasts have previously been\nreported in [7, 8], where theoretical results of series-\nresonant and series-parallel LCC electronic ballasts are\nshown to provide good agreement with measured data, at\nthe expense of requiring significant computation overhead.\nMoreoften therefore, designers return to Fundamental\nMode Analysis (FMA) [9, 10] for simplifying and\nspeeding-up the design and analysis process, at the expense\nof neglecting the important harmonic and sub-harmonic\ncontent of the circuit voltages and currents.\nHere then, the paper considers cyclic analysis [11, 12, 13,\n14] as a candidate technique for the rapid analysis and\ndesign of 4th_order LCLC resonant inverters, suitable for\nuse as electronic ballasts for example, including a treatment\nof parasitic effects. The main aim of the full paper is\ntherefore to address the lack of suitable design\nmethodologies for high order, high frequency resonant\nconverters, the lamp providing a suitable candidate\napplication for exploitation and verification of the work.\nBy suitable manipulation, the resulting models are then\nemployed to analytically predict the voltage and current\nstresses on the resonant components, with measurements\nfrom a prototype 8W, 4th_order, capacitively coupled ballast\nused to demonstrate the accuracy of the model predictions.\n140\n755\n4b_ I_\nII. ANALYSIS OF ELECTRODE-LESS FLOURESCENT-\nLAMP BALLAST\nAs previously discussed, suitable 4th_order electronic\nballasts must provide sufficient voltage to promote ignition,\nand a current limiting capability thereafter. Before the\nlamp is ignited, it can be assumed that the resistance\npresented to the output of the ballast is infinite i.e. the\noutput stage is open circuit. Consequently, the resonant\ninverter behaves as a tank circuit with a high effective Q to\nfacilitate ionization of the gas within the tube. Of note, is\nQJ\nVDC\nQ2\niLs\nCs Lrs\nIiF--\nthat the minimum capacitive discharge voltage decreases\nwith increasing frequency, when the capacitive coupling\nreactance becomes small. Once gaseous breakdown has\noccurred, the resistance decreases as the lamp conducts\ncurrent. From Fig.2(b), the nominal resistance of the lamp\nduring normal (8W) operation can, for this case, be\nestimated to be =470Q. An equivalent circuit of the\nsystem therefore consists of a 4h-order LCLC resonant\ninverter loaded by the lamp resistance, RIamp, see Fig.3.\nTransformer\nVN n\nN= pri\nvpri nsec\nNio0\nif\n4 ,Frequency, ct)s=27fs\nnsecV\n(Rlamp)rcpy rip\nFigure 3 LCLC resonant inverter for fluorescent lamp ballast (Riamp)\nState Variable Modelling\nFigure 3 depicts the structure of a 4th_order LCLC resonant\npower inverter. In high frequency inverters, such as those\nfor fluorescent lamp ballast applications, the parallel\nresonant components, Lp and Cp, are designed to be the\nmagnetising inductance and parasitic capacitance of a step-\nup transformer, whilst the series resonant component, Ls,\ntakes advantage of the transformer leakage inductance. In\nthis way, the high order circuit is achieved with few\nadditional passive components. Parasitic circuit elements\nhave also been included in Fig. 3 for completeness. A state-\nvariable dynamic model of the circuit can be derived by\nconsidering the resonant tank components and power\nswitches:\ndVCp -iLp-N io\ndt Cp\ndVCs =Is\ndt Cs\ndiLp VCp iLp (rcp + Asp'%p -ts N rcp io\ndt Lp\ndiLs Vin VCs -VCp is(rds+rcp +rcs+1s)+rcp iLp+N rcp iodt Ls\n(1)\nwith the output voltage VO and load current io given by:\nVO = N [VCP+ rcp (Ls -iLp -N io)], io =N ] (2)\nThe proposed state-variable model is therefore given by:\n0\nV] 0\n_\n11\nLS\n0\n0\n0\nL\ncp\n0\n_ Irp + rp\nLP\nrCp _ rd,\nLD\ncI N\nr~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+C++rj\n- NK J\n(3)\nTo demonstrate the accuracy of the model, an experimental\n4th_order LCLC inverter (VDC=12V) is considered, as\nrequired for example for battery backup lighting\napplications. A step-up toroidal transformer with primary to\nsecondary turn ratio n=0.5 is incorporated to demonstrated\nthe ability of the higher order resonant circuit to take\nadvantage of the transformer magnetising inductance. The\nresonant frequency of the tank circuit is highly sensitive to\nvariations in component values, and whilst C, and Cp can\nnormally be assumed to be within standard component\ntolerances, the inter-turn capacitance (CT) of LS and LP must\nbe accommodated. For example, the inter-turn capacitance\nof LP is measured as CTz3OpF at self-resonance. The\nresonant inductor and the inter-turn capacitance constitute a\nparallel resonant circuit, which resembles an equivalent\ninductance when excited below the combined resonant\nfrequency. A method of accommodating these effects is to\ndefine LS and LP as frequency-dependent equivalent\ninductances, see Fig. 4.\nThe frequency-dependent equivalent inductance, Lpeq, is\nthen obtained from the parallel combination ofLP & CT.\nZeq = j P = jJt(Lpeq, where Lpeq = p2C (4)\n141\n-CT 14 _ Lpeq\nFigure 4 Equivalent circuit of resonant inductor and stray capacitance\nAfter inclusion of the equivalent inductance (4) in the\ndynamic model, the measured output voltage of the inverter\nis compared with that predicted from the proposed state-\nvariable model, and Spice simulations, over a range of\noperating frequencies and output loads, including the open-\ncircuit condition are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the\nproposed model provides commensurate accuracy with\nresults obtained from Spice.\nIII. PRINCIPLES OF CYCLIC ANALYSIS\nAlthough the presented state-variable description has been\nshown to accurately model the behaviour of the 4th order\ninverter, the computation time remains prohibitive due to\nthe requirement for integration, and impedes the use of\nsuch models as an interactive design tool. This drawback\ncan be abated to some degree however by only considering\nthe steady-state behaviour of the circuit, thereby allowing\nanalytical solutions from the state equations to be obtained\nfor investigative and design validation purposes.\n140\nASpice\n1301 =940 ,Measured130 R 940 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~---State\n120\n110\n100\no R.=470\nD 90 A\n0\n80\n70\n60 l2.6 2.65 2.7 2.75 2.8 2.85 2.9\nFrequency ( MHz)\nFigure 5 Output voltage of the 4th_order resonant\ninverter at Rj= 470Q and, Rj= 940Q\nIn particular, it is now shown that cyclic-modelling [1 1, 13,\n14] provides a convenient methodology to facilitate the\nrapid solution of the steady state voltages and currents for\nthe 4th-order ballast.\nCyclic Modes\nAn electronic circuit is said to operate in a cyclic-mode\nwhen the state vector x(t) at any time t is equal to x(t+nT),\nwhere T is the switching period of the converter and n is an\ninteger, i.e. x(t+nT)=x(t). For a resonant inverter, each\ncycle is comprised of multiple operating modes, mi, each\ndependent on the state of the input voltage. When\nconsidering operation in a cyclic-mode, a system of\npiecewise linear (state-space) equations that describe the\ninverter in each operational mode during a cycle can be\nderived, viz.:\nXi = Aixi + Bi (5)\nwhere xi is the state vector, Ai represents the dynamics and\nBi is the excitation matrix during the j1h_operating mode.\nFor the ih mode, (5) can be solved analytically to give:\nXi (t) =eAitxi(to)+eAi (t )Bi d = ixi (to)+F1 (6)\n0\nwhere oi =t(t,t0) eAlt,feit|Ai(t r)Bjd1, and xi(t0)\n0\nare the initial conditions for the ith mode. By noting that the\ntime during which the circuit operates in the ith mode is dT,\nwhere d, is the duty, the complete solution for the system\ncan be obtained by employing the state vector at time diTas\nthe initial condition for the subsequent dynamics of the\n(i+l)th mode. However, the need to evaluate the integral in\n(6) is a key cause of the computational overhead when\nanalysing the system in this manner. By combining Ai and\nBi to form an augmented dynamics matrix, (7), the\nintegration overhead can be eliminated at the expense of\nobtaining only the 'cyclic' steady-state description:\ndt (1 )Ai(X x(') d\nNow, if mode 1 corresponds to the time period between to\nand tl, and mode 2 corresponds to the time period between\nt1 and t2 the solution for the state vector at the transition\ntime between modes 1 & 2, tl, is given by\nX1(t_(to) =4e 1 (t) . Similarly, the state\nvector at the transition time between modes 2 and 3, t2, is\nX2 (t2) = eA2d2Ti2 (to) = (D2Dx^ (to). In general, for the\nmth mode:\ni(tm ) = 4)m4M-1 * 1(to ) = 4)toti(to ) (8)\nwhere Di = X j, and x(tm) is the state-vector at\ntime tm for an initial conditionxi(to), and, therefore, by\ndefinition of the cyclic mode, is equivalent to the initial\ncondition for the cyclic solution. Since behaviour in the\ncyclic mode necessarily presumes periodic steady-state\noperation, the initial condition for operation in a cyclic\nmode is given by,\nXper (to )= (D-tot Ftot = x(to) (9)\nfrom which the initial condition for the voltage and current\nof the inverter and, together with (8) can be used to\ndetermine the voltage and current state at subsequent times.\nIV.

Substituting (10, 11)\ntogether with the duties, into (8, 9) therefore provides the\ninitial operating condition of the circuit in steady state and\nan analytical solution for the circuit behaviour. An\nexample phase portrait of the resonant circuit voltages and\ncurrents in steady state prior to ignition and during normal\noperation is shown in Fig. 7. It is notable that the\ncomputation time to obtain the analytical steady-state cyclic\nsolution of the state vector is -1\/10000x that required from\nSpice and other integration based simulation packages.\n150\n100 \/ Before lamp ignition\n50\nVcs+Vcp\n(V) 0\n-50\n-100\n-1.50\nx(t1)\nx(t1)\nNor al lamp operat cndition\nX(to)=Xper(to)\n\\\n__x(t_)=x (O,t)\n-2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2\niLs + iLp (A)\nFigure 7 Steady state cyclic trajectory of the 4th_order resonant\ninverter during normal lamp operation, and prior to ignition of lamp\nThe model is subsequently used to obtain a steady-state\ncyclic description of the circuit, and the derivation of\nanalytical formulae to calculate the electrical stresses on the\nresonant tank components. The accuracy of the proposed\ntechniques has been shown by comparisons with both Spice\nsimulations, and from measurements of an experimental\n8W, capacitively coupled, fluorescent lamp, with good\nagreement being demonstrated. It is notable that, whilst the\nstate-variable dynamic model requires a commensurate\ncomputational overhead to that of Spice simulations, the\npresented cyclic analysis method is typically 104x faster.\nVII REFERENCES\n[1] D. 0.
