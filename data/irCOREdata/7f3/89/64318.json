It can be divided into three 24 \ndistricts \u2013 a central granulite-facies district between districts of amphibolite-facies 25 \ngneiss to the north and south. Recent work has interpreted these districts in terms of 26 \nseparate terranes, initiating a controversy that has implications for how Precambrian 27 \nrocks are understood worldwide. The northern district of the Lewisian Gneiss 28 \nComplex (the Rhiconich terrane) is separated from the central district (the Assynt 29 \nterrane) by a broad ductile shear zone known as the Laxford Shear Zone.  30 \nThis paper reviews the geology of the Laxford Shear Zone, clarifying field 31 \nrelationships and discussing other evidence, to consider whether or not it does indeed 32 \nrepresent a terrane boundary. A detailed review of field, geochemical and 33 \ngeochronological evidence supports the recognition of the separate Assynt and 34 \nRhiconich terranes. Mafic dykes (the Scourie Dyke Swarm) and granitoids, of 35 \nPalaeoproterozoic age, occur on both sides of the Laxford Shear Zone and thus the 36 \nterranes were most probably juxtaposed during the late Archaean to early 37 \nPalaeoproterozoic Inverian event. Subsequently, the less-competent, more-hydrous 38 \namphibolite-facies gneisses of the Rhiconich terrane were affected by later 39 \nPalaeoproterozoic (Laxfordian) deformation and partial melting, to a greater extent 40 \nthan the more-competent granulite-facies gneisses of the Assynt terrane.    [end of 41 \nabstract]42 \n 3\n 43 \nThe Lewisian Gneiss Complex of north-western Scotland is one of the world\u2019s most 44 \nintensively studied regions of high-grade Precambrian gneisses, yet it continues to 45 \nprovide fruitful ground for new research. It crops out on the islands of the Outer 46 \nHebrides and also in a 140 km-long strip along the north-west coast of the Scottish 47 \nmainland, where it forms part of the foreland to the Caledonian orogen (Figure 1). 48 \nThe main outcrop is limited to the east by the Moine Thrust, although inliers of 49 \n\u2018Lewisianoid\u2019 gneiss occur to the east of this major structure. The Lewisian gneisses 50 \nform part of a now-disrupted Precambrian region in the North Atlantic, which also 51 \nincludes basement rocks in North America, Greenland and Scandinavia.   52 \nThe essential elements of the Lewisian Gneiss Complex were identified a century ago 53 \nby the authors of the classic Geological Survey Memoir on the Northwest Highlands 54 \n(Peach et al., 1907). They recognised that the complex consists largely of 55 \nmetamorphosed plutonic igneous rocks, with relatively minor metasedimentary and 56 \nmetavolcanic units, cut by a variety of less-deformed igneous intrusions. They also 57 \ndivided the mainland Lewisian into three districts, northern, central and southern; the 58 \ncentral district consisted largely of pyroxene-bearing gneiss (now recognised as 59 \ngranulite facies), whereas more strongly deformed hornblende- and biotite-bearing 60 \ngneisses (amphibolite facies) cropped out to the north and south.  61 \nThe main events within the Lewisian Gneiss Complex were later identified by Sutton 62 \nand Watson (1951), who recognised two major episodes of metamorphism and 63 \ndeformation, the \u2018Scourian\u2019 and \u2018Laxfordian\u2019 events, temporally separated by 64 \nintrusion of an extensive dyke swarm known as the Scourie Dyke Swarm. A third, 65 \namphibolite-facies event, younger than the Scourian but pre-dating the Scourie Dykes, 66 \nwas recognised by Evans (1965) and termed the \u2018Inverian\u2019. The \u2018Scourian\u2019 event was 67 \nlater renamed \u2018Badcallian\u2019 (Park, 1970) and more tightly defined as a period of early 68 \ngranulite-facies metamorphism, which has to date only been recognised in the central 69 \ndistrict of the Lewisian Gneiss Complex.  70 \nOver the last hundred years, the Lewisian Gneiss Complex has provided a natural 71 \nlaboratory for studies into many aspects of basement geology (Park et al. 2002; 72 \nWheeler et al. this volume). Major crustal-scale shear zones within the Lewisian 73 \ngneisses have been studied in detail, and provide large-scale examples of the type of 74 \n 4\nshear zones described and analysed by the classic work of Ramsay and Graham 75 \n(1970). Isotopic dating techniques were first harnessed for research into the history of 76 \nthe complex by Giletti et al. (1961) and have continued to provide crucial information 77 \nas techniques \u2013 and the application of these techniques to high-grade metamorphic 78 \nterranes \u2013 have been refined  (see summary in Kinny et al., 2005).  79 \nMost recently, geochronological data have been used to identify crustal blocks with 80 \ndifferent histories within the Lewisian Gneiss Complex, and it has been proposed that 81 \nthese represent separate terranes that were assembled along major shear zones (Friend 82 \nand Kinny, 2001; Kinny et al., 2005). The details of this model remain rather 83 \ncontroversial, and a simpler version \u2013 in which two main terranes collided but were 84 \nthen divided into blocks by strike-slip movement \u2013 has also been proposed  (Park, 85 \n2005). Overall, though, the idea that the Lewisian Gneiss Complex does not represent 86 \na contiguous block of Archaean crust is becoming more widely accepted. It is clear 87 \nthat the terrane model can usefully be tested by detailed investigations of the \u2018terrane-88 \nbounding\u2019 shear zones (Mason and Brewer, 2005). 89 \nOne of the strongest candidates for a terrane-bounding shear zone is the Laxford 90 \nShear Zone, which separates the amphibolite-facies gneisses of the \u2018northern district\u2019 91 \nfrom the granulite-facies gneisses of the \u2018central district\u2019. Following Coward and Park 92 \n(1987), the Laxford Shear Zone is here defined as the broad (~ 8 km) zone of Inverian 93 \nand Laxfordian ductile shear that extends along the southern shore of Loch Laxford 94 \nand continues along the northern side of Ben Stack (Figures 2a, b). During the 95 \n\u2018Continental Tectonics and Mountain Building\u2019 conference in Ullapool in May 2007, 96 \nthe authors of this paper engaged in two days of vigorous scientific discussion about 97 \nthe age and type of movements along that shear zone. The conclusions and further 98 \nquestions from that debate are presented here. This paper concentrates on reviewing 99 \nprevious work, clarifying the field relationships, and describing a consensus that has 100 \nbeen reached by all the authors on the nature of the Laxford Shear Zone. Many 101 \ndisparate views on other aspects of the Lewisian exist within the author team, and 102 \nthese cannot all be addressed here.  103 \n 5\n 104 \nPrevious work on the Laxford Shear Zone 105 \nThe Lewisian gneisses of the Laxford area were first mapped by the Geological 106 \nSurvey towards the end of the nineteenth century (Peach et al., 1892) and described in 107 \nthe North-west Highlands Memoir (Peach et al., 1907). The surveyors recognised that 108 \nLoch Laxford lay roughly along a zone that separated biotite- and hornblende-bearing 109 \ngneisses of the \u2018northern district\u2019 from pyroxene-bearing gneisses of the \u2018central 110 \ndistrict\u2019 of the Lewisian Gneiss Complex. They described the rocks of the northern 111 \ndistrict as containing mafic layers that could be deformed dykes \u2018of the Scourie type\u2019, 112 \nand abundant granites and pegmatites that cross-cut all the other rock-types. They also 113 \nnoted \u2018it is probable that all the granite dykes were not intruded at the same time\u2019. In 114 \nthe Loch Laxford area, they identified three WNW-ESE-trending belts in the 115 \nLewisian gneisses:  116 \n1) A north-eastern belt in which hornblende- and biotite-bearing gneisses are cut 117 \nby intrusions of granite and pegmatite that \u2018probably exceed in bulk\u2019 the 118 \ngneisses themselves.  119 \n2) A middle belt of hornblende- and biotite-bearing gneisses cut by mafic dykes, 120 \nwith abundant folds and shear zones. This belt was essentially what we would 121 \nnow describe as the Laxford Shear Zone.  122 \n3) A south-western belt of pyroxene-bearing gneisses in which the gently dipping 123 \ngneissosity is cross-cut by undeformed mafic dykes (the Scourie Dyke 124 \nSwarm).  125 \nThe next major study of the area was that of Sutton and Watson (1951). They 126 \nconsidered that three major \u2018episodes\u2019 could be recognised in the history of the 127 \ngneisses around Loch Laxford: an early, \u2018Scourian\u2019 metamorphic event during which 128 \ngranulite-facies pyroxene-bearing gneisses were formed; a period of intrusion of 129 \ndolerite dykes (the Scourie Dykes); and a second, \u2018Laxfordian\u2019 metamorphic event in 130 \nwhich the gneisses of the northern district were retrogressed to form hornblende- and 131 \nbiotite-bearing gneisses (amphibolite facies metamorphism). Sutton and Watson 132 \nbelieved that the gneisses of the central and northern districts shared the same early 133 \nhistory, and were only distinguished by the later effects of the Laxfordian event. They 134 \ndivided the Loch Laxford area into five zones (Figure 2b) and suggested that the 135 \n 6\nvariations across the zones were controlled by an episode of deformation, \u2018producing 136 \nstructures with a north-west to south-east trend\u2019 and a front of migmatisation. The five 137 \nzones are (from SW to NE):  138 \n1) The Scourie zone, in which Laxfordian movement and metamorphism have 139 \nonly had a local effect on the \u2018Scourian complex\u2019. This equates to the south-140 \nwestern belt of the 1907 Memoir. Sutton and Watson (1962) suggested that the 141 \nnorth-eastern boundary of this zone should be taken as the \u2018local Laxfordian 142 \nfront\u2019, and thus that all the gneisses to the north had undergone retrogression 143 \nand metasomatism during the Laxfordian event. 144 \n2) The Claisfearn zone, consisting of flaggy gneisses with a steep south-145 \nwestward dip, and \u2018numerous shear-belts\u2019. 146 \n3) The Foindle zone, also with steep south-westward dips, and incorporating a 147 \nthick band of mafic rocks (Figure 2a). Units of brown-weathering, schistose 148 \nbiotite-bearing gneisses were recognised and were considered to have formed 149 \nthrough metasomatism of the mafic rocks. Shear belts were described as being 150 \n\u2018entirely confined to the basic bodies\u2019 over much of this zone, and granite and 151 \npegmatite veins were considered to \u2018dwindle\u2019 southwards across the zone. The 152 \nClaisfearn and Foindle zones together represent the middle belt of the 1907 153 \nMemoir.  154 \n4) The Badnabay zone, in which a large number of \u2018concordant sheets of granite-155 \ngneiss\u2019 appear and \u2018there are no shear-belts\u2019; the main foliation in this area 156 \nwas considered to equate to the second foliation formed in the shear belts to 157 \nthe south.  158 \n5) The Laxford zone, \u2018thickly veined with granites and pegmatites\u2019 and with no 159 \nsecond foliation. The Badnabay and Laxford zones together equate to the 160 \nnorth-eastern belt of the 1907 Memoir.  161 \nAn alternative theory was proposed by Bowes (1962), who was the first to suggest 162 \nthat the rocks of the northern district had been tectonically juxtaposed with those of 163 \nthe central district during the Laxfordian event. Lambert and Holland (1972) defined 164 \nthe boundary between the two districts as the Ben Stack line, equivalent to the 165 \nboundary between the Foindle and Badnabay zones of Sutton and Watson (1951) 166 \n(Figure 2b). Following the identification of the pre-Scourie Dyke Inverian event in the 167 \n 7\ncentral district (Evans, 1965), Holland (1966) noted that the area around Loch 168 \nLaxford also showed the effect of two successive amphibolite-facies metamorphic 169 \nevents (the pre-Scourie Dyke Inverian and post-dyke Laxfordian). Rb-Sr and K-Ar 170 \ndating of gneisses placed the age of the Laxfordian event at Laxford Bridge as 171 \nbetween c. 1850 and 1750 Ma (Lambert and Holland, 1972). 172 \nGeochemical studies of the Lewisian gneisses (Holland and Lambert, 1973; Sheraton 173 \net al., 1973) indicated that, on average, the gneisses to the north of the \u2018Ben Stack 174 \nline\u2019 are rather richer in K2O, Rb, Th, U and SiO2 than those to the south. This 175 \nevidence supported the theory of Bowes (1962) that the northern district gneisses did 176 \nnot represent retrogressed equivalents of the granulite facies gneisses of the central 177 \ndistrict, and that the Laxford Shear Zone represented a major structure along which 178 \ntwo separate crustal blocks were juxtaposed.  179 \nBeach et al. (1974) formalised the term \u2018Laxford Front\u2019, which was defined as the 180 \nsouthern limit of migmatites and Laxfordian granite sheets. This limit is 181 \napproximately equivalent to the Ben Stack Line, but is difficult to place in the field, 182 \nsince scattered Laxfordian granite sheets do occur to the south of the area of 183 \nmigmatitic gneisses (Peach et al., 1907). Beach et al. (1974) studied the structural 184 \nevolution of the Loch Laxford area, and recognised three significant deformation 185 \nphases in the Laxford area, one pre-Scourie Dyke intrusion and two post-dyke. They 186 \nmapped and described pre-Scourie Dyke folds but did not directly correlate their 187 \nstructures with the Inverian event, as defined near Lochinver by Evans (1965). They 188 \nstated that \u2018there was negligible vertical displacement\u2019 on the Laxford Shear Zone 189 \nduring this first phase of deformation, but described post-Scourie Dyke shear zones 190 \nwith an oblique sinistral and north-up sense of movement. Structures formed in the 191 \nthird deformation phase were only recognised north of Laxford Bridge.  192 \nDavies (1974) followed suggestions made by Beach et al. (1974) in interpreting the 193 \nbrown-weathering, schistose biotite-bearing gneisses (\u2018brown schists\u2019) of the Foindle 194 \nzone as metamorphosed supracrustal rocks. He presented a detailed map of this zone 195 \nand suggested that the supracrustal rocks lay on top of, and were infolded with, a 196 \nlayered, mafic igneous sheet. Davies (1976) presented evidence that the folding of this 197 \nsupracrustal\/mafic igneous complex occurred before the end of the early granulite-198 \nfacies metamorphism in the central district, and thus proposed that the belt of 199 \nsupracrustal rocks originated as a distinctive structure during the Archaean. Okeke et 200 \n 8\nal. (1983) studied the chemistry of the brown biotite-bearing gneisses, and confirmed 201 \nthat they represented a metasedimentary sequence of pelitic, semi-pelitic and 202 \npsammitic gneisses. Recent detrital zircon dating indicates that the metasedimentary 203 \nrocks were most probably derived from central district gneisses (Love, 2004). It has 204 \nbeen suggested that this association of mafic and ultramafic rocks with 205 \nmetasedimentary rocks could represent a marginal ocean-floor assemblage, 206 \ntectonically accreted to the continental margin (Park and Tarney, 1987).  207 \nCoward and Park (1987) and Coward (1990) re-investigated the structures of the 208 \nLaxford area. Coward (1990) stated that \u2018the southern margin of Laxfordian 209 \ndeformation\u2026. has the form of a large scale ductile shear zone, and is often termed 210 \nthe Laxford Front\u2019. This shear zone was described as striking NW-SE, and ~ 8 km in 211 \nwidth, with heterogeneous deformation throughout. Coward (1990) recognised that 212 \npervasive Laxfordian deformation had occurred in a zone to the south of Laxford 213 \nBridge (the Badnabay zone) whereas further to the south (in the Claisfearn and 214 \nFoindle zones) discrete Laxfordian shears are superimposed on Inverian deformation. 215 \nCoward and Park (1987) suggested that the granulite-facies gneisses of the central 216 \nregion had been thrust over the amphibolite-facies gneisses to the north during the 217 \nInverian. The granulite-facies gneisses were then displaced back down toward the 218 \nsouth during early Laxfordian deformation. A later Laxfordian movement, following 219 \ngranite emplacement, was described as having a south-up, dextral shear sense. 220 \nIn the late 1980s, a sea-change began to occur in the way in which the Lewisian 221 \ngneisses were investigated. Whitehouse (1989) used Sm-Nd isotopic data to suggest 222 \nthat the crust of the different \u2018districts\u2019 within the Lewisian Gneiss Complex might 223 \nhave formed at different times. Following on from this, modern isotopic techniques \u2013 224 \nparticularly U-Pb dating of zircons \u2013 were used to date events in the Lewisian 225 \nComplex far more precisely than had hitherto been possible. Corfu et al. (1994) and 226 \nFriend and Kinny (1995) presented U-Pb zircon and titanite data for gneisses in the 227 \ncentral district immediately to the south of the Laxford Shear Zone. Differing 228 \ntechniques were utilised by these authors; Corfu et al. (1994) analysed whole grains 229 \nor fragments of grains by conventional isotope dilution (ID-TIMS), whereas Friend 230 \nand Kinny (1995) carried out in situ analysis using a high-resolution ion microprobe 231 \n(SIMS). Both groups of authors recognised the complexity of the zircons in their 232 \nsamples, and different events affecting the zircons were recognised through the use of 233 \n 9\nthe differing techniques. The use of SIMS allowed Friend and Kinny (1995) to date 234 \nthe oldest zircon cores, giving an age for the tonalitic gneiss protoliths of c. 2960 Ma. 235 \nThe data in both studies were interpreted to show that the gneisses were 236 \nmetamorphosed to high grade at 2490-2480 Ma, with a later metamorphic phase at 237 \nc.1750 Ma. However, an earlier high-grade metamorphic event at c. 2710 to 2760 Ma, 238 \nwhich was recognised by Corfu et al. (1994) and Zhu et al. (1997), was not resolvable 239 \nfrom the data of Friend and Kinny (1995). This has led to ongoing debate over the 240 \nabsolute ages of the Badcallian and Inverian events (Corfu, 2007; Friend et al., 2007), 241 \nwhich is largely focused upon the reconciliation of differences between data sets 242 \nobtained by the different analytical techniques, and on the geological interpretation of 243 \ncomplex internal zonation and age patterns among zircon samples.  244 \nKinny and Friend (1997) presented further U-Pb (SIMS) zircon and titanite data 245 \nwhich showed that the gneisses to the north of the Laxford Shear Zone had a 246 \nmarkedly different history to those of the central district. Gneisses of the northern 247 \ndistrict were shown to have protolith ages of 2800-2840 Ma with evidence for later 248 \ndioritic intrusions at c. 2680 Ma, but no evidence was found for early high-grade 249 \nmetamorphism. Isotopic evidence for Laxfordian reworking at c. 1750 Ma and c. 250 \n1670 Ma has been found in both districts (Kinny and Friend, 1997; Corfu et al., 251 \n1994).  252 \nThis work thus led to the suggestion that the Laxford Shear Zone represented the 253 \nboundary between two distinct crustal blocks, which were tectonically juxtaposed 254 \nbetween 2480 Ma and 1750 Ma (Kinny and Friend, 1997). On the basis of these new 255 \ndates, it has been proposed that the \u2018northern district\u2019 of Peach et al. (1907) should be 256 \nre-named the Rhiconich terrane, and that the northern part of the \u2018central district\u2019 257 \nshould be termed the Assynt terrane (Friend and Kinny, 2001; Kinny et al., 2005). For 258 \nease of discussion, these names will be used henceforward in this paper \u2013 although 259 \nthis should not be taken to imply complete acceptance of the terrane model at this 260 \nstage.  261 \nSubsequently, Friend and Kinny (2001) dated a granite sheet from the north side of 262 \nLoch Laxford at c.1855 Ma. They believed that these granite sheets only occur in the 263 \nRhiconich terrane and thus stated that the two crustal blocks were juxtaposed between 264 \n1855 Ma and 1750 Ma. A sample of gneiss from the \u2018Badnabay zone\u2019 of Sutton and 265 \nWatson produced a protolith age of c.2760 Ma, which was taken to indicate that this 266 \n 10\nzone belonged to the Rhiconich terrane (Friend and Kinny, 2001). The boundary 267 \nbetween the two terranes was described as \u2018the highly strained boundary between the 268 \nBadnabay and Foindle zones\u2019 (Friend and Kinny, 2001) and this boundary was 269 \ndescribed as the Laxford shear zone (Kinny et al., 2005). This is somewhat different 270 \nfrom the Laxfordian front of Sutton and Watson (1962), which represented the 271 \nsouthern limit of Laxfordian reworking and was taken at the southern margin of the 272 \nClaisfearn zone. As discussed above, we follow Coward and Park (1987) in defining 273 \nthe Laxford Shear Zone as the broad, NW-SE zone of intense, ductile, Inverian and 274 \nLaxfordian shear that runs along the southern side of Loch Laxford (Figure 2b), and 275 \nencompasses the Badnabay, Foindle and Claisfearn zones of Sutton and Watson 276 \n(1951). Within the Laxford Shear Zone, the true boundary between rocks of the 277 \nAssynt and Rhiconich terranes is very difficult to place on the ground, as discussed in 278 \nthe next section.   279 \n 280 \nField relationships and structure 281 \nThe Assynt terrane south of the Laxford Shear Zone 282 \nThe typical gneisses of the Assynt terrane are chiefly TTG (tonalite \u2013 trondhjemite \u2013 283 \ngranodiorite), granulite-facies gneisses, commonly grey in colour and well-banded on 284 \nthe scale of a few centimetres (Peach et al., 1907). Enclosed within the grey gneisses 285 \nare mafic to ultramafic enclaves, the largest of which approach a kilometre in size. 286 \nMany of these enclaves represent low-strain zones and in some cases relict igneous 287 \ntextures such as cumulate layering can be identified (Davies, 1974), although the 288 \nmineral assemblages are metamorphic (e.g. two pyroxenes + plagioclase + garnet in 289 \nthe mafic rocks). Gneisses of metasedimentary origin are also found at a few 290 \nlocalities, notably on the north side of Scourie Bay (Okeke et al., 1983) and further 291 \nsouth at Stoer (Cartwright et al., 1985). These are quartzofeldspathic gneisses with 292 \nabundant garnet and biotite; kyanite, sillimanite, staurolite and corundum have been 293 \nrecorded. Granulite-facies assemblages are locally preserved within the grey gneisses, 294 \nthe mafic-ultramafic bodies, and the metasedimentary gneisses, although partial 295 \nretrogression to amphibolite-facies assemblages is common throughout the Assynt 296 \nterrane, and pervasive retrogression has occurred in discrete areas of later reworking. 297 \n 11\nThe gneisses are cut by Scourie Dykes, which are relatively undeformed, except 298 \nwhere they are cross-cut by Laxfordian shear zones.  299 \nThe dominant early structure in the northern part of the Assynt terrane is a gently to 300 \nmoderately west- or north-west-dipping gneissose layering (Beach et al., 1974), 301 \nwhich encloses rare intrafolial folds of a pre-existing foliation (e.g. Sheraton et al., 302 \n1973). This gneissose layering is the result of high to very high strain as evidenced by 303 \nabundant pods, lenses and thin layers of mafic material that appear to have been 304 \nextended and thinned parallel to it, and is generally considered to be associated with 305 \nthe Badcallian event (Park, 1970). A poorly-preserved weak grain-aggregate shape 306 \nlineation generally plunges towards the west or north-west.  307 \nWithin the Assynt terrane, the gneisses are cut by a number of discrete shear zones. 308 \nThe Canisp and Stoer shear zones are major, kilometre-wide steep zones of intense 309 \nductile deformation and amphibolite-facies retrogression. These major shear zones are 310 \nconsidered to have formed in the Inverian and reactivated in the Laxfordian  (Attfield, 311 \n1987; Coward and Park, 1987). Smaller-scale Laxfordian shear zones, a few metres to 312 \ntens of metres in thickness, are common across the Assynt terrane. These Laxfordian 313 \nshear zones increase in number northwards, into the Scourie zone of Sutton and 314 \nWatson (1951). In this zone, the gneissose layering is affected by local open folds and 315 \nby metre-scale monoclinal folds with thinned short limbs (shear zones) that are 316 \nassigned to the Inverian (Evans 1965, Evans & Lambert 1974).  317 \nThe Laxford Shear Zone 318 \nThe Laxford Shear Zone (LSZ) can be divided into southern, central and northern 319 \nsectors that essentially correspond to the Claisfearn, Foindle and Badnabay zones of 320 \nSutton and Watson (1951) (Figure 2b). The rocks within the LSZ are distinguished 321 \nfrom those to the south both by the incoming of intense, pervasive ductile 322 \ndeformation, and by the ubiquitous presence of amphibolite-facies assemblages.  The 323 \nrock-types found in the southern and central parts of the LSZ (the Claisfearn and 324 \nFoindle zones) include some evidence for relict granulite-facies assemblages (Davies, 325 \n1974) and so are considered to belong to the Assynt terrane, whereas the northern part 326 \n(the Badnabay zone) largely belongs to the Rhiconich terrane (Kinny et al. 2005).  327 \nThe southern and central parts of the Laxford Shear Zone 328 \n 12\nWithin the southern part of the LSZ (the Claisfearn zone), the main foliation in the 329 \ngneisses trends uniformly WNW\u2013ESE, dips steeply (50-700) to the south-west, and is 330 \naxial-planar to occasional folds of the earlier gneissose banding. The foliation is cut 331 \nby several steep NW\u2013SE-trending Scourie Dykes (Figure 3), and the discordant 332 \nrelationships can be seen at many localities (e.g, around Tarbet; Beach, 1978). This 333 \nfoliation is therefore considered to be Inverian, resulting from the thinning, steepening 334 \nand transposition of the original Badcallian gneissose banding into a broad Inverian 335 \nshear zone. In places, a weak to moderately strong mineral lineation plunges to the 336 \nsouth-east. Together with the reported antiformal bending of the earlier foliation into 337 \nthe major Inverian shear zone, this suggests that the direction of movement on this 338 \nshear zone was south-side-up and oblique dextral (Coward and Park, 1987). Larger-339 \nscale Inverian folds, also cross-cut by the dykes, were mapped and described by 340 \nBeach et al. (1974) (Figure 3).   341 \nThe central part of the LSZ (the Foindle zone) contains a major belt of 342 \nmetamorphosed mafic and ultramafic rocks, some garnetiferous, extending south-east 343 \nfrom north of Tarbet as far as Ben Stack (Figure 2a; Davies 1974, 1976). These are 344 \ncommonly associated, and locally interfolded, with brown-weathering, garnet-biotite 345 \nsemipelitic gneisses. The mafic bodies range in size, from a few metres up to several 346 \nhundred metres in thickness, and are laterally continuous for many kilometres. 347 \nSignificant variations in strain can be seen across the mafic-ultramafic belt: in low-348 \nstrain areas, the rocks show relict igneous textures such as cumulate layering (e.g. 349 \nnorth of Gorm Loch around NC 2150 4450; Davies, 1974) and granulite-facies 350 \nassemblages may be preserved, with some spectacular large garnet aggregates 351 \n(Davies, 1974); whilst in higher-strain areas amphibolite-facies mafic and 352 \nmetasedimentary gneisses are finer-grained, strongly foliated and lineated, with 353 \nfoliations dipping steeply south-west and mineral lineations plunging towards the 354 \nsouth-east. Most of these fabrics can be shown to be Inverian, since relatively 355 \nundeformed Scourie Dykes cut across the amphibolite\/semipelite assemblage at a 356 \nnumber of locations (e.g. south of Badnabay around NC 2335 4425). Davies (1976) 357 \nshowed that this assemblage had been folded prior to Scourie Dyke intrusion.  358 \nWithin the southern and central parts of the LSZ described above, later Laxfordian 359 \ndeformation takes the form of discrete, narrow (1 \u2013 100 m), steeply dipping shear 360 \nzones, which have displaced the Scourie Dykes and led to the development of a 361 \n 13\nlocalised foliation (Beach, 1974). A hornblende grain shape lineation within these 362 \nzones plunges moderately south-east, approximately parallel to the earlier Inverian 363 \nlineation, but the sense of movement is changed to oblique, sinistral and north side up 364 \n(Beach et al. 1974). These Laxfordian shear zones only occupy a relatively small 365 \nproportion (<10%) of the outcrop area, but the sum of movement associated with 366 \nthem may be of the order of tens of kilometres (Coward, 1990; Beach, 1974). Away 367 \nfrom these narrow shear zones the overall Laxfordian strain in the southern and 368 \ncentral parts of the LSZ appears to be very low, although Laxfordian strain within the 369 \ngneisses is hard to distinguish from Inverian effects in areas where Scourie Dykes are 370 \nabsent. Minor folding of dyke margins appears to be restricted to the Laxfordian shear 371 \nzones(Beach et al. 1974). There is no evidence throughout the south-central parts of 372 \nthe LSZ for any large-scale Laxfordian folds. 373 \nThe Scourie Dykes maintain their NW\u2013SE trend throughout the southern and central 374 \nparts of the LSZ; although they are displaced by the discrete Laxfordian shear zones, 375 \nthey show no tendency to rotate overall into a more WNW\u2013ESE orientation parallel to 376 \nthese shear zones. In the model suggested by Coward (1974) the Inverian shear zone 377 \nacts as an antithetic south-down shear zone which rotates in an anticlockwise fashion, 378 \nlooking north-east, during the Laxfordian. Thus the south-down sinistral shear sense 379 \nexhibited by the steeply dipping Laxfordian shear zones where they cut the Scourie 380 \nDykes is a response to horizontal north-directed shear (Figure 4).  381 \nIn some places the Scourie Dykes deflect into and follow the zones of Inverian shear 382 \nfor a short distance, or send small veins parallel to them (e.g. south of Tarbet at 383 \nNC1639 4854). These deviations from the normal trend of the dykes can often be 384 \nshown to be intrusive features and not due to later Laxfordian deformation, as first 385 \ndeduced by Clough (in Peach et al. 1907; see also Park & Cresswell 1972). 386 \nWithin the central part of the LSZ, scattered biotite granite and granitic pegmatite 387 \nsheets up to 10 m thick cut across the mafic\/ultramafic bodies, the semipelitic 388 \ngneisses, and the quartzofeldspathic gneisses (e.g. south of Badnabay at NC 2168 389 \n4574). Some of the granitoid sheets carry a weak Laxfordian fabric, but they clearly 390 \ncross-cut the dominant Inverian foliation (Figure 5). In some cases the granite sheets 391 \nare axial-planar to small-scale upright Laxfordian folds. The relationship between 392 \nthese granite sheets and the discrete Laxfordian shear belts described above is unclear. 393 \nHowever, it is important to note that these granitic sheets cut rocks (such as the 394 \n 14\nmafic\/ultramafic gneisses and metasedimentary gneisses) that are generally agreed to 395 \nbelong to the Assynt terrane, contrary to the suggestion of Friend and Kinny (2001) 396 \nthat the granitic sheets occur only in the Rhiconich terrane.  397 \nThe northern part of the Laxford Shear Zone 398 \nThe northern part of the LSZ is equivalent to the Badnabay zone of Sutton and 399 \nWatson (1951) (Figure 2b). It is characterised by the presence of abundant sheets of 400 \ngranite and granitic pegmatite, varying in thickness from 1 to 100 m, which cut highly 401 \nstrained gneisses (Figure 6). The thicker granites are weakly foliated and are mostly 402 \nconcordant with the main foliation in the gneisses. This strong foliation dips steeply 403 \ntowards the south-west, and is essentially indistinguishable from the Inverian foliation 404 \nin the southern and central parts of the LSZ. However, in the northern part of the LSZ 405 \nthis main fabric has been identified as Laxfordian in age (Coward, 1990). This 406 \nconclusion is difficult to confirm due to the apparent absence of Scourie Dykes within 407 \nthe northern part of the LSZ, although the closest Scourie Dykes do seem to be 408 \nstrongly thinned (Peach et al., 1892; Figure 2a) \u2013 this indicates that at least some of 409 \nthe deformation is Laxfordian, but it may have been superimposed upon significant 410 \nInverian deformation.  411 \nSutton and Watson (1951) defined the southern boundary of their Badnabay zone by 412 \nthe incoming of abundant, weakly foliated granitic sheets (the Rubha Ruadh granites). 413 \nIt is of course very difficult to draw a boundary along the southern side of the \u2018zone of 414 \nabundant granitic sheets\u2019 since the definition of \u2018abundant\u2019 is naturally subjective. 415 \nThe most likely candidate for such a boundary would be the margin of a  ~ 50 m thick 416 \ngranitic sheet, which forms steep cliffs on the northern slopes of Ben Stack, and 417 \nextends north-west as far as Badnabay, beyond which it divides into thinner sheets 418 \nthat die out along strike (Figure 2a). The margin of this thick granitic sheet (and its 419 \nextensions to the west) is discordant with the trend of the main foliation (as noted by 420 \nBeach et al., 1974). Furthermore, as described above, a number of weakly foliated to 421 \nundeformed granite sheets up to 10 m thick occur to the south of this main granite 422 \nsheet. 423 \nThe boundary between the Assynt and Rhiconich terranes, which is considered to lie 424 \nwithin the northern part of the LSZ, should separate banded tonalitic gneisses with 425 \nmafic, garnetiferous amphibolitic pods, from migmatitic granodioritic gneisses to the 426 \n 15\nnorth. This boundary cannot be defined as a sharp line on the ground. Around Loch 427 \nStack, it is typically obscured by thick granite sheets, but to the west it can be 428 \ntraversed at a number of localities. There are some localities where the boundary can 429 \nbe placed to within around one hundred metres; for example, in the A894 road cuts 430 \nclose to Loch na Claise Fearna (NC 2044 4710), outcrops of mafic and ultramafic 431 \nrocks with associated metasedimentary units rapidly give way northwards to 432 \nmigmatitic gneisses. However, in other places the boundary appears much more 433 \ngradational on a scale of hundreds of metres, with the incoming of increasing amounts 434 \nof granodioritic material to the north. On the south side of Loch Laxford, near Rubha 435 \nRuadh, abundant granitic sheets cut tonalitic gneisses with mafic to ultramafic lenses, 436 \nwhich appear to belong to the Assynt terrane (Figure 6).  437 \nThe Rhiconich terrane north of the Laxford Shear Zone 438 \nTo the north of Loch Laxford and the Laxford River (Figure 2a), thick granitic sheets 439 \n(> 10 m) are much less common, and the rocks are chiefly migmatitic amphibolite-440 \nfacies gneisses with an extensive, anastomosing network of thinner sheets of granite 441 \nand pegmatitic granite. The migmatitic gneisses of this area are grey to pink in colour 442 \nand broadly granodioritic in composition. Small mafic enclaves occur locally, but 443 \nrarely exceed 1 m in size; large garnet amphibolite bodies are not found. At the 444 \nnorthern margin of the LSZ the main (Laxfordian) foliation dips steeply to the south-445 \nwest in parallel with that within the LSZ (Figure 3). To the north, the foliation 446 \nbecomes less steep and gradually bends over to a sub-horizontal attitude at the crest of 447 \nthe Rhiconich antiform. The foliation is associated with a moderately south-east-448 \nplunging lineation similar to that in the LSZ. 449 \nIn some places, the granitic sheets make up > 50% of the outcrop area. They are 450 \ncommonly irregular in shape, cross-cut the gneissose layering, and are themselves 451 \nweakly foliated to undeformed. Locally, foliation-parallel migmatitic leucosomes can 452 \nbe traced into cross-cutting pegmatitic sheets (e.g. in road-cuts near Rhiconich at NC 453 \n2464 5191), indicating that these intrusive sheets are largely formed by partial melting 454 \nof local crust. This was apparently confirmed by Rb-Sr and Pb isotopic data for 455 \ngranites north of the LSZ which indicated crustal sources (Taylor et al., 1984). More 456 \nrecent experimental work (Watkins et al., 2007) has suggested that the composition of 457 \nthe granitic sheets could not be produced by the melting of local crustal sources in the 458 \nRhiconich terrane \u2013 although the parent gneisses used in their experiments had 459 \n 16\nunusually low K2O\/Na2O ratios when compared with the average compositions for 460 \ngneisses north of the LSZ given by Holland and Lambert (1973). The origin of the 461 \ngranitic sheets in the Rhiconich terrane is therefore uncertain. 462 \nAmphibolite sheets that are interpreted as part of the Scourie Dyke Swarm are 463 \ncommon in the region north of Loch Laxford. They are pervasively deformed, with a 464 \nstrong Laxfordian foliation, and are sub-parallel to the main gneissose layering, 465 \nalthough local low-angle discordances indicate that the dykes post-date the 466 \ngneissosity as in the Assynt terrane. The dykes, together with the gneissose layering, 467 \nare affected by a set of north-east-verging asymmetric overfolds on a scale of metres 468 \n(Beach et al., 1974). The granite and pegmatite sheets cut both the Laxfordian 469 \nfoliation in the dykes and the overfolds, being in some cases parallel to the fold axial 470 \nplanes. 471 \nCorrelation of structures across the Laxford Shear Zone depends on the identification 472 \nof the dykes in the Rhiconich terrane as part of the Scourie Dyke Swarm. If this 473 \ncorrelation is accepted, the pre-dyke foliation in the north could be correlated with the 474 \nInverian further south. There are however, significant differences in the post-dyke 475 \n(Laxfordian) structure across the LSZ, the most obvious being the much greater 476 \nintensity of Laxfordian deformation and folding in the north. These differences in 477 \ndeformation are most simply explained by the competence differences between the 478 \ngranulite-facies Assynt terrane and the more ductile gneisses of the Rhiconich terrane; 479 \nexperimental evidence shows that anhydrous granulite-facies rocks are significantly 480 \nmore competent than hydrous amphibolite-facies rocks (e.g. Wilks and Carter, 1990). 481 \nThe Inverian shear zone provided a convenient boundary along which the high 482 \nLaxfordian strain was focused into the more ductile rocks of the Rhiconich terrane.  483 \nGeochemical characteristics of the Assynt and Rhiconich terranes 484 \nThe Laxford Shear Zone separates two areas with very different geochemical 485 \ncharacteristics; the gneisses of the Assynt terrane are conspicuously depleted in K, 486 \nRb, Th and U, and have very high K\/Rb ratios, when compared to the gneisses of the 487 \nRhiconich terrane (Sheraton et al., 1973; Holland and Lambert, 1973). The origin of 488 \nthese differences has been the subject of extensive debate, the conclusions of which 489 \nhave important implications for the terrane model.   490 \n 17\nThe characteristic alkali element depletion in the Assynt terrane gneisses has been 491 \nwidely attributed to removal of these elements by CO2-rich fluids during granulite-492 \nfacies metamorphism (Sheraton et al., 1973; Hamilton et al., 1979; Weaver and 493 \nTarney, 1981a), although it has also been suggested that the gneisses represent the 494 \nresiduum left after the removal of partial melts (Pride and Muecke, 1980; Cartwright 495 \nand Barnicoat, 1987). However, Tarney and Weaver (1987) raised the possibility that 496 \nthe element depletions seen in the Assynt terrane could be a primary feature of the 497 \noriginal igneous intrusions, related to the subduction-zone processes through which 498 \nthe original magmas were formed. This idea was supported by the work of Cartwright 499 \nand Valley (1992) who used oxygen isotope data to show that large volumes of fluid 500 \ndid not pass through the gneisses of the Assynt terrane during granulite-facies 501 \nmetamorphism, whilst Rollinson (1994) provided arguments against partial melting. 502 \nMore recently, Rollinson (1996) and Rollinson and Tarney (2005) have argued that 503 \nthe geochemical features of the Assynt terrane are indeed primary igneous features, 504 \nwith the original magmas being derived from a subducting slab that has undergone 505 \nincremental melting and early removal of the fluid-mobile elements. 506 \nRecent work has revived the older idea that the gneisses of the Rhiconich terrane were 507 \noriginally also depleted, but were metasomatically enriched in K, Rb, Th and U, 508 \ncausing partial melting and migmatisation, during the Laxfordian (Sutton and Watson, 509 \n1951; Castro, 2004). Although the introduction of fluid may well have played some 510 \nrole in the Laxfordian migmatisation, it is likely that such metasomatism would have 511 \nbeen localised along shear zones, and that it would be possible to find 512 \nunmetasomatised regions that preserved a pre-Laxfordian composition. Examples of 513 \nthis process have been demonstrated in granulite facies gneisses in the Bergen Arcs 514 \n(Austrheim, 1987). In the Rhiconich terrane, all the gneisses \u2013 even away from areas 515 \nof intense deformation and migmatisation \u2013 have similar K, Rb, Th and U contents 516 \n(Weaver and Tarney, 1981a). 517 \nIt therefore appears most likely that the geochemical differences in the gneisses across 518 \nthe Laxford Shear Zone are a primary feature, due to distinctly different protolith 519 \ngeochemistries, rather than being related to metamorphic histories. The gneisses of 520 \nthe Assynt terrane were most probably formed from magmas derived by melting of a 521 \nsubducting slab (Rollinson and Tarney, 2005), whereas the chemistry of the 522 \nRhiconich gneisses is more like that of modern-day calc-alkaline igneous rocks, and 523 \n 18\nthe most likely origin for the magmas is in the mantle wedge above the subducting 524 \nslab. The geochemistry thus does indicate that there were differences in the process of 525 \ncrust formation to the north and south of the Laxford Shear Zone (Rollinson, 1996).  526 \nAs part of the recent BGS mapping of the area, Scourie Dykes from the Rhiconich 527 \nterrane were sampled and analysed for major and trace elements (Table 1). These data 528 \ncan be compared with the geochemistry of the Scourie Dykes in the Assynt terrane, 529 \nwhich has been studied by Weaver and Tarney (1981b). There is considerable 530 \ngeochemical variation within the Scourie Dykes of the Assynt terrane, and the 531 \nsamples from the Rhiconich terrane lie within the same range. On multi-element plots 532 \n(Figure 7), all the dykes from both terranes are characterised by negative Nb 533 \nanomalies, which have typically been considered to be a feature of the lithospheric 534 \nmantle source of the Scourie Dykes (Weaver and Tarney, 1981b). The Scourie Dykes 535 \nfrom within the Rhiconich terrane do typically have higher K and Rb contents than 536 \nthose within the Assynt terrane, but this can almost certainly be attributed to 537 \ncontamination of the magmas by the surrounding gneisses. Overall, the geochemical 538 \ndata indicate that Scourie Dykes from both the Rhiconich and Assynt terranes are 539 \nlikely to be part of the same dyke swarm.  540 \nDoes the Laxford Shear Zone separate two distinct terranes? 541 \nThe concept of separate terranes that have been accreted to form a now-contiguous 542 \ntectonic belt was developed in the North American Cordillera. Terranes were 543 \ndescribed as blocks of crust that are \u2018characterised by internal homogeneity and 544 \ncontinuity of stratigraphy, tectonic style and history\u2019 with the boundaries between 545 \nterranes being \u2018fundamental discontinuities in stratigraphy\u2019 that separate \u2018totally 546 \ndistinct temporal or physical rock sequences\u2019 (Coney et al., 1980). Boundaries 547 \nbetween terranes were considered as \u2018faults that usually display complex structural 548 \nhistory\u2019. 549 \nSeveral lines of evidence support the recognition of different terranes to the north and 550 \nsouth of the Laxford Shear Zone.  551 \n\u2022 Field and petrographical evidence clearly indicates different metamorphic 552 \nhistories across the Laxford Shear Zone \u2013 in particular the existence of a 553 \ngranulite-facies metamorphic event that affected the whole of the Assynt 554 \nterrane but for which there is no evidence in the Rhiconich terrane.  555 \n 19\n\u2022 SIMS U-Pb zircon dating has showed that the protolith ages of gneisses in the 556 \nRhiconich terrane (2800 \u2013 2840 Ma) are different from those in the Assynt 557 \nterrane (2960 \u2013 3030 Ma) (Kinny and Friend, 1997).  558 \n\u2022 A metamorphic event at c. 2490 Ma in the Assynt terrane (Corfu et al., 1994; 559 \nKinny and Friend, 1997) has not been identified in samples from the 560 \nRhiconich terrane.  561 \n\u2022 The gneisses of the Assynt terrane are strongly depleted in K, Rb, Th and U, 562 \nand have very high K\/Rb ratios, when compared to the gneisses of the 563 \nRhiconich terrane (Sheraton et al., 1973; Holland and Lambert, 1973). These 564 \ngeochemical differences are considered to be igneous rather than metamorphic 565 \n(Rollinson and Tarney, 2005).  566 \n\u2022 The Laxford Shear Zone is a major structure with a complex structural history.   567 \nAs pointed out by Park (2005), it is possible for rocks with different protolith ages and 568 \ngeochemistries to occur within the same terrane, simply representing plutons intruded 569 \nat different ages but adjacent to each other. However, in the example under discussion 570 \nhere, it is clear that the plutonic rocks to the north and south of the Laxford Shear 571 \nZone have undergone different metamorphic histories, before being juxtaposed along 572 \na major ductile shear zone. When considered together, the variation in protolith ages, 573 \nmetamorphic histories, and protolith geochemistry provide evidence that the Laxford 574 \nShear Zone separates two blocks of crust that are both temporally and physically 575 \ndistinct. In this respect, the LSZ satisfies the criteria laid out by Coney et al. (1980) 576 \nfor a terrane boundary. However, it must be noted that the relative position of these 577 \nterranes, prior to their juxtaposition, has not been quantified.   578 \nWhen were the two terranes juxtaposed?  579 \nThere is little doubt that the two terranes were separated at the time that granulite-580 \nfacies metamorphism (the Badcallian event) took place in the Assynt terrane, since 581 \nthere is no field, petrographical or geochronological evidence for this event in the 582 \nRhiconich terrane. The absolute age of this event is uncertain (Corfu, 2007; Friend et 583 \nal., 2007. However, a metamorphic event which occurred at c. 2490 Ma in the Assynt 584 \nterrane (Corfu et al., 1994; Kinny and Friend, 1997) has not been identified in zircons 585 \nfrom the Rhiconich terrane, and this may indicate that the two terranes were separate 586 \nup to this point (Friend and Kinny, 2001).  587 \n 20\nThe first event that appears to be common to both terranes is the intrusion of the 588 \nScourie Dykes. The Scourie Dykes in the Assynt terrane have been dated as c. 2000 \u2013 589 \n2400 Ma (Heaman and Tarney, 1989; Waters et al., 1990); no examples have been 590 \ndated from the Rhiconich terrane. As discussed above, the field relationships and 591 \ngeochemistry of the dykes in the Rhiconich terrane are compatible with their being 592 \npart of the Scourie Dyke Swarm, and it is therefore possible that the two terranes were 593 \njuxtaposed by the time of Scourie Dyke intrusion. Unfortunately, no Scourie Dykes 594 \ncan be traced that cut right across the Laxford Shear Zone; the early mapping 595 \nindicated that they are strongly thinned into the area of intense Laxfordian 596 \ndeformation in the northern part of the LSZ (Peach et al., 1892).  597 \nIn their development of a terrane model, Friend and Kinny (2001) made the 598 \nassumption that Laxfordian granite sheets (the \u2018Rubha Ruadh granites\u2019) only occur in 599 \nthe Rhiconich terrane. On this basis, having dated one of these granite sheets at 1854 600 \n\u00b1 13 Ma, they suggested that the terranes must have been juxtaposed following the 601 \nemplacement of the granites. However, as described above, further study of the field 602 \nrelationships shows that some granite sheets cut mafic-ultramafic bodies and 603 \nmetasedimentary gneisses that are generally agreed to be part of the Assynt terrane, as 604 \noriginally recognised by Sutton and Watson (1951), and the granites therefore \u2018stitch\u2019 605 \nthe two terranes. No dates have yet been published for these granites within the 606 \nAssynt terrane, but on the basis of field relationships they appear likely to be related 607 \nto the Rubha Ruadh granites.  608 \nIt has been shown that partial melting of Archaean granulite-facies tonalitic gneisses, 609 \nlike those of the Assynt terrane, only produces very small amounts of magma (Castro, 610 \n2004). In contrast, it is likely that the gneisses of the Rhiconich terrane, with higher 611 \namounts of the fusible, heat-producing elements and higher contents of hydrous 612 \nmineral phases, could produce significantly larger volumes of partial melt. Thus, we 613 \nsuggest that partial melting and formation of granitic magmas occurred preferentially 614 \non the north side of the Laxford Shear Zone, with only limited intrusion of granites on 615 \nthe southern side. Similarly, later Laxfordian deformation was preferentially taken up 616 \nby the more ductile gneisses to the north. The heat source that caused the partial 617 \nmelting is unknown, but it is possible that it may have been due to the introduction of 618 \nmore primitive, mantle-derived magma into the base of the crust. However, the only 619 \nmafic magmatism known around that time is the South Harris Complex of the Outer 620 \n 21\nHebrides Lewisian, which was intruded at c. 1880-1890 Ma (Whitehouse and 621 \nBridgwater, 2001; Mason et al., 2004), some time prior to the formation of the Rubha 622 \nRuadh granites.  623 \nWe have shown that the two terranes were certainly juxtaposed prior to c. 1854 Ma 624 \ngranite intrusion, and probably prior to 2000-2400 Ma Scourie Dyke intrusion, but 625 \nclearly after the Badcallian granulite-facies metamorphism in Assynt. We therefore 626 \nsuggest that the two terranes were brought together during the first and most 627 \npervasive phase of deformation on the LSZ; the Inverian event. During this event, 628 \ndeformation was focused along the terrane boundary as the granulite-facies gneisses 629 \nof the Assynt terrane were thrust over the gneisses of the Rhiconich terrane (Coward 630 \nand Park, 1987). It should be noted that the terms \u2018Badcallian\u2019 and \u2018Inverian\u2019 are used 631 \nhere as they were originally defined; that is, as the granulite-facies and amphibolite-632 \nfacies events, respectively, that occurred prior to the intrusion of the Scourie Dyke 633 \nSwarm. The absolute age of these events continues to be the subject of a debate 634 \n(Corfu, 2007; Friend et al., 2007), which cannot be resolved by the evidence 635 \npresented here.  636 \nConclusions  637 \nThis reappraisal of the Laxford Shear Zone highlights the importance of integrating 638 \nfield observations with geochronological and geochemical data in the development of 639 \nany geological model for high-grade gneiss areas. There is significant evidence to 640 \nshow that the Assynt and Rhiconich terranes represent separate blocks of crust with 641 \nvery differing histories: the geochemical data illustrate differences in their 642 \npetrogenesis, whilst geochronological, petrological and field data show that the 643 \nAssynt terrane has experienced a granulite-facies tectonic event that did not affect the 644 \nRhiconich terrane.  645 \nThese two separate terranes were juxtaposed along the major Laxford Shear Zone, 646 \nwhich was a locus for both Inverian and Laxfordian deformation. Reappraisal of the 647 \nfield relations has indicated that Laxfordian granites occur across the Laxford Shear 648 \nZone and thus it is likely that the terranes were juxtaposed prior to the Laxfordian 649 \nevent. We therefore suggest that terrane juxtaposition occurred during the Inverian 650 \nevent, the exact age of which is as yet uncertain (although it is likely that it occurred 651 \nrelatively soon after the Archaean \u2013 Proterozoic boundary at c. 2500 Ma). The 652 \n 22\nterrane-bounding shear zone was substantially reactivated during the Laxfordian, as a 653 \nsite of both deformation and magmatism.  654 \nMany questions remain to be answered with reference to the formation of the Laxford 655 \nShear Zone. How much movement was there along the LSZ in the Inverian, and what 656 \nexactly were the kinematics of shearing? Do the mafic-ultramafic and 657 \nmetasedimentary rocks found within the LSZ represent a fragment of ocean floor that 658 \nonce separated the terranes and that was then accreted to the continental margin, as 659 \nsuggested by Park and Tarney (1987) \u2013 or were the two crustal blocks formed at a 660 \ndistance from each other within the same continental mass, and subsequently moved 661 \ntogether? How can we harness the different available techniques to improve our 662 \ninterpretation of the complex zircons found in the Lewisian gneisses, and thus reach a 663 \nconsensus on the dates of the main events? What, indeed, is the absolute age of the 664 \nInverian, and was this a time of more regional terrane amalgamation? What were the 665 \ntectonic processes that were operating at the end of the Archaean to bring these 666 \nterranes together? As ever, the rocks of the Lewisian Gneiss Complex remain a 667 \nfruitful subject for further research.  668 \n 669 \nAcknowledgements 670 \nRob Butler, Bob Holdsworth, Maarten Krabbendam, Rick Law and Rob Strachan 671 \norganised the conference in Ullapool that stimulated our discussions on the Laxford 672 \nShear Zone.
