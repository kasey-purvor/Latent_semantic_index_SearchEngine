Emilia J. Huttunen,1 Hannu E. J. Koskinen,1,2 Tuija I. Pulkkinen,2 Antti Pulkkinen,2\nMinna Palmroth,2 E. Geoffrey D. Reeves,3 and Howard J. Singer4\nReceived 2 November 2001; revised 4 June 2002; accepted 26 June 2002; published 13 December 2002.\n[1] On 4 April 2000, a coronal mass ejection (CME) took place close to the western limb\nof the Sun. The shock front of the CME hit the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere on 6 April. A strong\ninterplanetary southward BZ event in the sheath region caused a magnetic storm that was\nthe second strongest in the year 2000 if quantified by the peak of the Dst index. We\nhave analyzed this sequence of events using observations of several spacecraft in the solar\nwind and at geostationary orbit as well as recordings from more than 80 magnetometer\nstations at latitudes higher than 40\u0001N. In the sheath region behind the shock, the\ninterplanetary magnetic field had an intense and long-sustained southward magnetic field\norientation, and the solar wind magnetic pressure was very large, which compressed the\ndayside magnetopause inside geostationary orbit for a period of more than 6 hours. We\nconclude that it was the fluctuating but strongly southward field accompanied by the high\npressure that allowed for the exceptionally strong driving of magnetospheric activity.\nDuring the main phase of the storm, the magnetosphere and ionosphere were in highly\nperturbed states, with several activations all around the auroral region. Detailed analysis\nshows that many of these activations were not substorms, in the sense that they were not\nassociated with poleward and westward electrojet\/auroral enhancement or geostationary\nparticle injections, but were directly driven perturbations due to variations in the solar\nwind features. In fact, it was found that the development of the entire storm was quite\nindependent of substorm activations and injections. Instead, the ring current development\nwas driven by the strong convection enhancements. During the storm, the geomagnetically\ninduced currents were strongly enhanced during several periods. While some activations\nwere associated with substorm onsets or electrojet enhancements, others were caused by\nextremely localized and short-lived electrojet activations.

The preliminary (no pressure cor-\nrection) Dst index reached levels below\u0001200 nT three times,\nof which one exceeded \u0001300 nT. In particular, the so-called\nBastille Day storm, initiated by a coronal mass ejection\n(CME) on 14 July, has received considerable interest (for\npreliminary information, see the ISTP Web page (http:\/\/\nwww-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov\/istp\/events\/2000july14\/)). In this\nstudy we analyze a large storm during which the second\nlowest Dst value during the year 2000, \u0001288 nT (with\npressure correction \u0001314 nT), was reached. The storm\noccurred on 6\u20137 April 2000, when magnificent auroral\ndisplays were seen in Central Europe as the main phase of\nthe storm took place in the time sector 18\u201301 UT.\n[3] It is now well established that CMEs lie behind\npractically all large magnetospheric storms [Tsurutani et\nal., 1988; Gosling et al., 1991; Richardson et al., 2001].\nHowever, there is a rich variety in the geoefficiency of\nvarious features associated with interplanetary manifesta-\ntions of CMEs (ICMEs) and it can make a large difference\nwhether the magnetosphere is hit by a slow ICME without\nan interplanetary shock, by an ICME with shock, or by the\nshock only when the ICME ejecta does not intercept the\nmagnetosphere [Gosling et al., 1991; Huttunen et al.,\n2002].\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 107, NO. A12, 1440, doi:10.1029\/2001JA009154, 2002\n1Department of Physical Sciences, Theoretical Physics Division,\nUniversity of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\n2Geophysical Research, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki,\nFinland.\n3Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA.\n4NOAA Space Environment Center, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\nCopyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/02\/2001JA009154$09.00\nSMP 15 - 1\n[4] Finally, the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) plays a decisive role in the energy transfer\nfrom the solar wind to the magnetosphere and only events\nwith prolonged and sufficiently strong southward IMF can\ndrive intense magnetospheric storms. For example, Gon-\nzalez and Tsurutani [1987] determined that IMF Z com-\nponent less than \u000110 nT lasting more than 3 hours can be\nused as a predictor for the Dst index reaching values\nbelow \u0001100 nT.\n[5] The storm on 6\u20137 April 2000, was an example of a\nmagnetospheric storm driven by an intense southward IMF\nin the sheath region between the shock and the ICME. As\ndiscussed below, early on 7 April there were signatures of\nCME ejecta, but the observations suggest that the spacecraft\nhit only the flanks of the ejecta. In this paper we perform a\nthorough analysis of the solar wind driver of the storm\nbased on three spacecraft (SOHO, ACE, and WIND) in the\nupstream solar wind, and one (GEOTAIL) in the dayside\nmagnetosheath. Furthermore, the geostationary GOES-8\nand GOES-10 satellites crossed the dayside magnetopause\nduring the event, which allows a reliable confirmation of the\nmagnetopause location determined using the empirical\nmagnetopause model of Shue et al. [1998].\n[6] We examine the magnetospheric response to the solar\nwind driver using observations in the magnetosphere and in\nthe polar ionosphere. This includes a careful analysis of the\nmajor substorm-like activations using data from a large\nnumber of magnetometer stations all around the high-\nlatitude northern auroral zone. Furthermore, we discuss\nthe large geomagnetically induced current (GIC) observed\nin Finland during the storm main phase. A better under-\nstanding of the detailed connection between the features of\nICMEs and their geomagnetic consequences is essential in\ndeveloping reliable warning and forecasting systems for\noperators of ground-based energy distribution systems.\n2. Data and Methods\n[7] We have used observations from several spacecraft,\nboth inside and outside the magnetosphere. Three space-\ncraft, SOHO, ACE, and WIND, were monitoring the solar\nwind upstream of the Earth. ACE and SOHO were both\nlocated near the L1 point more than 200 RE from the Earth,\nand WIND was located, early on 6 April, around 64 RE from\nthe Earth, and was traveling toward the Earth. Solar wind\ndata from ACE, due to its relatively steady position, have\nbeen used to analyze features of the intense southward\nmagnetic field structure after the shock that caused the\nmajor magnetic storm. The WIND data, in turn, due to\nthe closer location of the spacecraft to the Earth, have been\nused to connect the disturbances in the solar wind to\nmagnetic disturbances in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and\nionosphere and to estimate the energy input into the\nmagnetosphere as well as the magnetopause location. GEO-\nTAIL made observations in the magnetosheath, and trav-\nersed from the morning side magnetosphere through the\nsubsolar magnetopause to the duskside magnetosphere dur-\ning the early phases of the storm. Positions of these four\nspacecraft projected on the ecliptic plane on 6\u20137 April 2000\nare shown in Figure 1. Their locations at the time of the\nshock arrival are marked by filled circles. We have also used\ndata from five geostationary satellites, GOES-8, GOES-10,\n1989-046, 1991-080, and 1994-084, to study the dynamics\nof the inner magnetosphere.\n[8] To determine the level of magnetic activity at the\nEarth we have used the Kp and Dst indices from the World\nData Center C2 in Kyoto. The Dst index aims to measure\nthe strength of the equatorial ring current, whereas Kp is a\nmore global storm indicator often having significant con-\ntribution from the high-latitude auroral electrojets [e.g.,\nGonzalez et al., 1994]. We have also utilized 77 ground-\nbased magnetometers all around the high-latitude auroral\nzone in order to study the global ionospheric response and\nto identify substorm signatures during the storm period.\n3. Storm Sequence From the Sun to the Earth\n3.1. Solar Observations\n[9] The LASCO [Brueckner et al., 1995] C2 coronagraph\nonboard SOHO first observed a halo CME on 4 April 2000\nat 1632 UT. This CME caused a strong magnetic storm at\nthe Earth 2 days later. The initial observations were made\nafter a 90 min data gap, when the leading edge had already\nleft the C2 field of view. The coronagraph images show that\nmost of the CME material was centered over the west limb.\nThe plane-of-the-sky speed was reported to be 1188 km\/s\n(SOHO\/LASCO CME catalog (http:\/\/cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.\ngov)). This CME event was associated also with other types\nof solar activity: GOES-8 satellite recorded a C9.7 class\nflare in the NOAA active region 8933 (N18W58) at 1524\nUT. Also H-alpha images from Holloman AFB, New\nMexico, showed a disappearance of a large filament pre-\nceding the CME onset. The filament was located near the\nnorthwest limb (N25W55) and it extended vertically along\nthe surface of the Sun. The filament activation started at\n1441 UT and continued until 1535 UT.\nFigure 1. Position of SOHO, ACE, WIND, and GEO-\nTAIL satellites in 6 and 7 April projected on the ecliptic\nplane. The satellite locations at the time of the shock\nobservation are indicated by filled circles.\nSMP 15 - 2 HUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM\n[10] The first signature of this solar event near 1 AU was\nobserved soon after the flare when a solar particle event was\nrecorded. For example, GOES-8 measured the increase in\n>10 MeV protons starting around 1600 UT on 4 April 2000.\nContinuing acceleration of particles at the interplanetary\nshock maintained the intensities at an enhanced level until\nthe shock arrival at 1 AU on 6 April.\n3.2. Solar Wind Observations\n[11] The strong interplanetary shock was first observed\nby the CELIAS instrument onboard SOHO at 1601 UT on 6\nApril. Shortly after this, the shock was recorded by ACE at\n1604 UT and at 1632:28 UT by WIND. Finally it was\ndetected at 1641:30 UT by GEOTAIL located in the\nmagnetosheath. Figure 2 shows the ACE measurements\nfor a 2 day period from 6 to 8 April. Shown in Figure 2\nare the solar wind magnetic field intensity (a), magnetic\nfield components in the GSE coordinate system (b\u2013d), solar\nwind speed (e), density (f ) and temperature (g) as well as\nthe solar wind alpha to proton ratio and the O+7\/O+6 ratio\ndivided by 10 (h). We have also calculated the proton beta\n(i) and dynamic pressure ( j). The shock is clearly identifi-\nable as a distinct jump in the solar wind parameters at 1604\nUT. Before the shock, the solar wind was flowing at about\n380 km\/s; at the shock the solar wind speed increased\nsuddenly by about 200 to almost 600 km\/s. Simultaneously\nthe ion density increased from 7 to about 22 cm\u00013, and the\nmagnetic field intensity from 8 to 28 nT. The upstream\nAlfve\u00b4n speed was 64 km\/s and the downstream Alfve\u00b4n\nspeed 128 km\/s. The distance between ACE and WIND in\nthe X-direction was 171 RE and the time difference between\nthe shock observations was about 28.5 min. If the shock\npropagation is assumed to have been in the X-direction, this\nwould yield an average shock speed of 638 km\/s.\nFigure 2. Solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices for a 2 day interval from 6 to 8 April 2000\nmeasured by ACE. The panels from top to bottom show the magnetic field intensity (a) and magnetic\nfield components in the GSE coordinate system (b\u2013d), the ion speed (e), density (f ), and temperature\n(g), and the alpha-to-proton ratio and hourly average O+7\/O+6 ratio (h), proton beta (i), and dynamic\npressure ( j). The dashed horizontal line in panel g presents the temperature expected for normal solar\nwind expansion and the solid horizontal lines in panels i and j show limit values for CME-associated\nsolar wind plasma.\nHUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM SMP 15 - 3\n[12] The direction of the magnetic field displayed irreg-\nular behavior both upstream and downstream of the shock.\nAlso velocity downstream of the shock had irregular behav-\nior. Thus, the shock normal direction (nsh) could not be\ndetermined very accurately. We have applied different\ntechniques [e.g., Tsurutani and Lin, 1985] for different\nupstream and downstream intervals using data from WIND\nand ACE spacecraft. The velocity coplanarity theorem\ncould not be used for ACE data as there was about a 10\nmin data gap in ACE solar wind measurement upstream of\nthe shock. Depending on the method used and selected\nintervals quite different shock normal orientations are\nfound. We have applied the magnetic coplanarity theorem\nnshk(Bu \u0001 Bd) \u0003 (Bu \u0003 Bd) where u denotes upstream\nvalues and d downstream values of the shock for ACE data,\nwhich was available with the highest cadence. This yields\nshock normal orientation (\u00010.85, 0.13, \u00010.52) in solar\necliptic coordinates or the longitudinal angle f = 171\u0001\nand latitudinal angle q = \u000131\u0001. The shock angle qBn, i.e.,\nthe angle between the shock normal and the upstream\nmagnetic field direction was 85\u0001 defining the shock as\nquasi-perpendicular. The shock speed can be determined\nfrom conservation of the mass flux. Along the shock normal\nit is obtained from Vsh = nsh \u0004 ((ruVu \u0001 rdVd)\/(ru \u0001 rd)).\nThe chosen shock normal direction gives the shock prop-\nagation speed 635 km\/s along the shock normal which is\nconsistent with the value calculated above and the Alfve\u00b4nic\nMach number 5.1. The shock normal direction is consistent\nwith the CME originating from northern solar hemisphere,\nbut the shock longitudinal angle is not that large as would\nbe expected from the western source of the CME. From\nWIND measurements we obtain the shock normal direction\n(f, q) = (169\u0001, \u000148\u0001) using magnetic coplanarity theorem\nand (f, q) = (170\u0001, \u000144\u0001) using velocity coplanarity\ntheorem (nshk(Bu \u0001 Bd) \u0003 ((Vu \u0001 Vd) \u0003 Bu)). These\nvalues agree substantially well with the direction obtained\nfrom ACE but they give too slow shock velocity (about 560\nkm\/s). Besides of the irregular behavior of the magnetic\nfield and velocity, the magnetic coplanarity theorem is not\nreliable for near-perpendicular shocks. The shock normal\ndetermination could be improved by solving the nonlinear\nleast squares Rankine\u2013Hugoniot equations [e.g., Vin\u02dcas and\nScudder, 1986], but as the solar wind data needed for this\nmethod was available only from WIND with low cadence\nand the shock orientation is not the main concern of our\npaper this is not discussed further. The transfer time of first\nC2 CME observation to the shock observation at ACE was\napproximately 47.5 hours. However, it should be noted that\nFigure 2. (continued)\nSMP 15 - 4 HUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM\ncoronagraph images are associated with the driver gas not\nthe shock front.\n[13] The IMF Z-component upstream of the shock was\nslightly negative, decreasing after the shock to values below\n\u000110 nT. About 1 hour after the shock, the magnetic field\nturned strongly southward (BZ < \u000120 nT) and the solar\nwind density and temperature decreased. BZ remained\nbelow \u000120 nT for about 7 hours and turned abruptly to\nnorthward orientation before 24 UT on 6 April 2000. After\nthe shock the magnetic field intensity was high, over 30 nT,\nbut its direction fluctuated rapidly. The IMF X-component\nwas mainly positive and the Y-component mainly negative\nbut they both showed a complex behavior, especially BY\nwhich had long amplitude fluctuations. Slow, monotonic\nrotation of the magnetic field, which is the signature of an\nICME exhibiting flux rope topology, commonly a called\nmagnetic cloud [Burlaga, 1988], was not detected. Instead,\nBZ jumped rapidly from south to north.\n[14] The solar wind speed at the edge of the high-B\nstructure was 570 km\/s, and the speed profile stayed\nrelatively flat. The solar wind density (Figure 2f ) was\nclearly enhanced with respect to the ambient value through-\nout the high-B structure. Initially, the density was between\n10 and 20 cm\u00013, but about 1 hour before the BZ northward\nturning the density increased and had two larger enhance-\nments reaching almost 50 cm\u00013. Solar wind temperature\nwas also unusually high with a maximum value of about\n3 \u0003 105 K. The dashed line in Figure 2g shows the expected\ntemperature (Tex) from the correlation of the solar wind\nspeed and proton temperature for normal solar wind expan-\nsion [Richardson and Cane, 1995]. Unusually low temper-\natures are characteristic of ICMEs, and the proton\ntemperature (Tp) is often significantly depressed relative to\nthe expected temperature (Tp\/Tex \u0005 0.5) [Richardson and\nCane, 1995]. In this case the measured proton temperature\nwell exceeded the expected temperature. Unusually high\nratios of ionized helium number density to proton number\ndensity (na\/np > 0.08) have been shown to be present in\nmany ICME events before, during, or after the ICME\n[Borrini et al., 1982]. Together with the na\/np ratio in\nFigure 2h is plotted the hourly average of the solar wind\nO+7\/O+6 density ratio divided by 10. Within slow-speed\nsolar wind the O+7\/O+6 ratio has high variability which\ndistinguishes different sources of slow solar wind [Zurbu-\nchen et al., 2000] and a high ratio of O+7\/O+6 has been\nrelated to ICMEs having magnetic cloud topology [Henke et\nal., 1998]. The interval of the high helium abundance and\nenhanced O+7\/O+6 ratio did not occur until 06 UT on 7\nApril. Counterstreaming suprathermal electrons are some of\nthe most commonly used ICME signatures [e.g., Gosling,\n1990; Zwickl et al., 1983] interpreted to be indicative of a\nclosed magnetic field configuration with field lines either\nattached to the Sun at both ends or forming closed loops.\nDuring the high-B structure, there was no evidence of\ncounterstreaming electrons in WIND 3D plasma summary\nplots (not shown).\n[15] The solar wind dynamic pressure (Figure 2i) was 2 nPa\nbefore the shock and increased to 10 nPa. The pressure\nincreased further with time and reached values as high as\n25 nPa. The proton beta is shown in Figure 2j with the solid\nline marking the value 0.1. Usually beta is less than 0.1 in the\nICME-associated solar wind plasma [Burlaga et al., 1981].\nIn this case, just after the shock, proton beta was over 0.5 and\nit dropped to about 0.2 at the time of the BZ decrease. Later,\nthe beta values rose again due to the increased particle\npressure.\n[16] The duration of the high-B structure after the shock\nwas 16 hours giving a radial extent of 0.22 AU using the\naverage speed of 570 km\/s. Following the high-B structure,\nFigure 2 shows a period of fast flow with low magnetic field\nintensity (about 5 nT) starting around 0830 UT on 7 April\n2000. This flow was not a corotating stream [Smith and\nWolf, 1976] as the temperature was very low. Many sig-\nnatures of the ICME-related plasma [e.g., Gosling, 1990]\nwere detected a few hours before and during the fast flow.\nOn 7 April there was a discontinuity at 0609 UT when the\nlongitude angle rotated about 170\u0001 and the latitude angle\nabout 80\u0001. Solar wind plasma parameters and magnetic field\nintensity did not change in magnitude and the magnetic\nfield normal to the discontinuity boundary had a nonzero\nvalue suggesting a rotational discontinuity. Just after the\ndiscontinuity, the magnetic field became smoother and there\nwas an increase above the CME-related plasma limit in the\nratio of na\/np (>0.08) as well as in the O\n+7\/O+6 ratio (>1.0).\nHowever, magnetic field strength decreased within 2 hours\nto as low as 5 nT. At 08 UT on 7 April plasma beta dropped\nto very low values (<0.1) and coincidentally the temperature\nwas much lower than would be expected during such high\nsolar wind speed plasma [Richardson and Cane, 1995].\nAlso WIND 3D plasma summary plots (not shown) showed\na counterstreaming suprathermal electron event starting\naround 08 UT on 7 April. Based on the magnetic field\nobservations and other ICME signatures described above,\nwe suggest that the boundary between the sheath region\nplasma and the ICME plasma was around 06 UT on 7 April.\nThus, the ICME arrived about 12 hours after the shock. The\ntransit time for the ICME from the first C2 observation is\n61.5 hours, giving the average transit speed of 668 km\/s.\n[17] In conclusion, the geoeffective structure after the\nshock (1604 UT on 6 April to 06 UT on 7 April 2000),\nthat is our main interest, was certainly not expanding and\nfails to fulfill the criteria for an ICME. The rapidly varying\nmagnetic field direction, high temperature and density are\nrather characteristic of the sheath region [Tsurutani et al.,\n1988], i.e., the piled-up solar wind between the shock and\nthe CME ejecta. After the sheath region, starting around 06\nUT on 7 April, there were many ICME signatures present\nbut it was not evident where the boundary of ICME plasma\nwas exactly located. The identification of an ICME is not\nunambiguous as a single ICME seldom exhibits all ICME\nsignatures and different features do not necessarily occur at\nthe same time and during the whole passage of the ICME\n[e.g., Gosling, 1990; Zwickl et al., 1983]. For this case the\nidentification was further complicated as the spacecraft (and\nthe Earth) most likely hit the ejecta far from its center where\nthe magnetic field and solar wind signatures are not so\ndistinct as near the center of the ICME.\n[18] Magnetic clouds are in many cases associated with\ndisappearing filaments and the orientation of magnetic\nclouds axes are found to generally coincide with the\norientation of the filament axis [Bothmer and Schwenn,\n1994; Marubashi, 1997] (i.e., filaments that are elongated\nhorizontally along the surface of the Sun produce magnetic\nclouds that have their axes lying in the ecliptic plane and\nHUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM SMP 15 - 5\nvertical filaments produce CMEs that have their axis\nperpendicular to the ecliptic plane). Enhanced O+7\/O+6\nand na\/np ratio, low beta and temperature as well as\ncounterstreaming electrons are characteristic to magnetic\nclouds [e.g., Zwickl et al., 1983; Gosling, 1990; Henke et\nal., 1998]. Furthermore as the CME on 4 April 2000 was\nassociated with the filament disappearance it is likely that\nthe structure spacecraft encountered on 7 April 2000 at\nabout 6 UT was a part of the ICME with magnetic cloud\nstructure. As the spacecraft hit only the flanks of this\nmagnetic cloud, we cannot determine its orientation from\nmagnetic field data. However, Ha-images of the associated\nfilament show that it was vertically elongated along the\nsurface of the Sun, from which we can infer that the axis\nof the magnetic cloud likely had high inclination relative\nto the ecliptic plane. It should be noted that the shock\nsurface is not a planar structure but curved around the\nejecta and thus in this case the axis of the magnetic cloud\nshould have had a large positive inclination relative to\necliptic to explain the obtained large negative latitudinal\nangle of the shock normal. Furthermore, as discussed in\nsection 3.3 measurements from geostationary orbit (GOES-\n8 and GOES-10) showed that the magnetosphere was more\ncompressed at the dawnside. Based on the observations\ndescribed above we suggest the scenario where the mag-\nnetic cloud, highly inclined relative to ecliptic, swept the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere from above and dawnside. Also the\nZ-component of the velocity had large negative values\n(down to \u0001120 km\/s in GSE coordinate system) down-\nstream of the shock consistent with the direction of the\nplasma flow bending around the ejecta having the above\nmentioned orientation.\n3.3. Arrival at Earth\n[19] Figure 3 shows the IMF Z-component, the solar wind\nspeed and the dynamic pressure as measured by WIND and\nthe subsolar distance to the magnetopause as computed\nfrom the Shue et al. [1998] model. As discussed in the\nprevious section, the shock was detected at the location of\nWIND at 1632 UT and in the magnetosheath by GEOTAIL\nat 1640 UT. This is consistent with the propagation time of\n8 min of the shock calculated from WIND observations.\nFigure 3. Magnetic field Z-component in GSM coordinates (a), solar wind speed (b), dynamic pressure\nfrom WIND data (c), and calculated subsolar distance to the magnetopause (d). WIND data have been\nshifted 12 min before and 8 min after the shock arrival at 1640 UT (indicated by the vertical line). The\noverlapping points have been omitted.\nSMP 15 - 6 HUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM\nNote that the structures in front of the shock arrived at a\nlower speed with a transit time of 12 min. In Figure 3 we\nhave shifted the data before the shock by 12 min and after\nthe shock by 8 min to represent the plasma conditions at the\ndayside magnetopause. The overlapping data points were\nomitted as physically they were hidden inside the shock\nstructure.\n[20] The empirical model by Shue et al. [1998] gives the\nmagnetopause location as a function of IMF BZ and the solar\nwind dynamic pressure. We have used the WIND measure-\nments and to calculate the dynamic pressure from proton\ndensity we have assumed the alpha-to-proton ratio to be 4%.\nBefore the shock arrival, the subsolar magnetopause was\nclose to its quiet-day position around 11 RE. The magneto-\npause started to move inward before the shock arrival. This\nwas caused by both the decrease of BZ and the density\nincrease in the shock foot region. The magnetopause was\ncompressed close to the geostationary orbit at about 1644UT.\nThemagnetosphere remained in a very compressed state until\nthe early hours of 7 April. The closest subsolar standoff\ndistance was about 5.5 RE at 2351 UT.\n[21] In Figure 4 we compare geostationary magnetic field\nobservations to the magnetopause position as predicted by\nthe Shue et al. [1998] model. The upper two panels show\nthe magnetic field observations from GOES-10 and the\ncalculated distance to the magnetopause in the direction of\nthe spacecraft (R, thick line) and to the subsolar point (R0,\nthin line). The two lower panels show the same parameters\nfor GOES-8. Both GOES-8 and GOES-10 observed the\nshock hitting the magnetopause at 1640 UT as a rapid jump\nin the magnetic field intensity. At this time both spacecraft\nwere well inside the magnetosphere.\n[22] GOES-10, located at east geographic longitude 225\u0001,\njust west of the US, moved during the magnetospheric\ncompression from the prenoon to the afternoon sector. It\ncrossed the magnetopause at 1801 UT, as shown by the\nrapid turning of the magnetic field north component to a\nsouthward orientation. At the location of the satellite, the\nmodel magnetopause distance was still 7.5 RE, indicating\nthat the real compression was much stronger than that\npredicted by the model. GOES-10 passed the local noon\nat 2100 UT. After 2155 UT the magnetopause flapped back\nand forth over the satellite several times, but during 2320\u2013\n0023 UT the satellite was again in the magnetosheath.\n[23] GOES-8, located at east longitude 285\u0001 above the US\nEast coast, was in the prenoon magnetosphere before the\narrival of the shock. At the time of the beginning of the\nmagnetospheric compression the spacecraft was in the noon\nsector, as nicely illustrated by the coincidence of R and R0 in\nthe lowermost panel of Figure 4. According to the magnetic\nfield observations the magnetopause made a short passage\nover GOES-8 at 1729 UT and was steadily inside its orbit\n1756\u20131839 UT.\n[24] Additional information about the timing of the shock\nhitting the magnetosphere can be inferred from Figure 5,\nwhere we have calculated the auroral electrojet index based\non 77 magnetometers at latitudes higher than 40\u0001 (discussed\nin more detail in section 3.4). Furthermore, data from two\nindividual magnetometers are shown from Baker Lake\n(64.4\u0001N, 264\u0001E) and Ouluja\u00a8rvi (64.5\u0001N, 27.2\u0001E). All these\ndata show a clear global storm sudden commencement\n(SSC) at 1641 UT.\n[25] Within the 1 min accuracy of magnetometer data\nboth in space and on ground one gets a consistent picture\nof the arrival of the interplanetary shock effects at the\nmagnetopause. By 1641 UT the change in the dayside\nmagnetopause current system was observable all around\nthe globe.\n3.4. Magnetospheric Activity\n3.4.1. Global Activity and Energy Input\n[26] In order to estimate the total energy input to the\nmagnetosphere we have calculated the epsilon parameter\nusing measurements from the WIND satellite. Figure 6a\nrepeats the IMF BZ as measured by WIND and shifted 8 min\nto the magnetopause (here we have not used the longer\ndelay before the shock as it is not relevant for the analysis).\nFigures 6b and 6c present the \u0001-parameter (\u0001 = 107VB2l0\n2\nsin4(q\/2), using SI units) which is a function of the solar\nwind velocity V and the IMF intensity B and direction (tan q\n= BY\/BZ) [Akasofu, 1979, 1981]. l0 = 7RE is an empirical\nparameter determined to fit the average energy input to the\naverage estimated output. The large variations in the mag-\nnitudes are the reason for showing the e parameter both in\nlogarithmic and linear scales. As the IMF was southward at\nthe shock arrival, the energy input to the magnetosphere\nincreased immediately after the shock passage to above\n5 \u0003 1012 W, although the largest energy input started only\naround 1750 UT when the IMF turned strongly southward.\nThe maximum value of epsilon, 1.3\u0003 1013W, was reached at\n2311 UT. The interplanetary BZ reached its minimum value\n\u000133 nT (in the GSM coordinate system) at about 2312 UT.\nThe IMF BZ stayed significantly southward (<\u000120 nT) until\n0016UTon 7April, with ewell above typical storm threshold\nvalues of 1012 W [Akasofu, 1981].\n[27] The dynamic pressure increased to about 10 nPa at\nthe shock arrival, and stayed at that level until about 23 UT\n(Figure 6d). Just after the BZ minimum, the dynamic\npressure increased to near 20 nPa showing oscillatory\nbehavior with a period of about 10 min. The global magnetic\nactivity is described in terms of the SYM H, which is a high-\nresolution (1 min) Dst-like index (also available at WDC2,\nKyoto). The positive jump in the SYM H index was not very\nlarge at the shock arrival, as the southward IMF initiated\ndayside magnetic field erosion simultaneously with the\npressure increase. Immediately following the shock passage,\nthe SYM H index started a steady decrease which continued\nuntil about 0015 on 7 April (Figure 6e). The storm recovery\nphase began after about 01 UT on 7 April, with increasing\nDst (and SYM H) values. The high dynamic pressure during\nthe entire storm main phase would make the measured SYM\nH values even lower, if they were pressure corrected [Burton\net al., 1975]. The pressure-corrected Dst reached a minimum\nvalue of \u0001314 nT at 01 UT on 7 April, 2 hours after the BZ\nminimum.\n[28] The Kp index (not shown) reached a storm value of\n7\u2013 during 15\u201318 UT. Kp was 8+ during 18\u201324 UT and\nfinally reached its maximum value 9\u2013 during 00\u201303 UT on\n7 April.\n[29] Figure 6f shows the IL index, which is an electrojet\nindex created from the IMAGE magnetometer network\nstations [Tanskanen et al., 2001]. As IMAGE was in the\nnight sector (from around 19 MLT at 1641 UT to around\n0430 MLT at 0200 UT), it was well positioned to measure\nHUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM SMP 15 - 7\nFigure 4.

Eight electrojet activity onsets were identified\nfrom individual magnetometer data from around the globe\n(see discussion below); the onset times are indicated with\nthe dotted lines. These eight activations and their times\nwere chosen initially based on IMAGE magnetometer\nchain data. The aim was to pick independent \u2018\u2018onsets\u2019\u2019\nrather than \u2018\u2018substorm intensifications.\u2019\u2019 Later, magneto-\nmeter data from other chains were used to justify the onset\nidentification, and the geosynchronous energetic particle\ninjections were used to adjust the timings. These choices\nare, therefore, to some extent subjective, as no unique\ncriteria for the \u2018\u2018global onsets\u2019\u2019 could be identified. Con-\nsistent with the AE(77) shown in Figure 4, the electrojet\nactivity enhanced directly after the shock arrival, and the\nmaximum disturbances reached almost 2000 nT around\n2330 UT on 6 April. It is interesting to note that the SYM\nH index showed no response to the high-latitude activa-\ntions before 2315 UT.\n3.4.2. Substorms and Convection Enhancements\n[30] In order to examine the electrojet enhancements in\nmore detail, individual magnetometers from several stations\naround the Northern Hemisphere were examined. The\nIMAGE ground magnetic recordings from Fennoscandia\nare shown from 11 stations (ordered from north to south) in\nFigure 7a. For tracking the global disturbances over the\npolar ionosphere, data from 10 magnetometers around the\nglobe are shown in Figure 7b, where the geographic\nlatitudes and longitudes of the recording stations are shown\nto the right of the image. The selected stations are a subset\nof the 77-station data set compiled to compute the AE index\nshown in Figure 5. The stations are ordered such that from\ntop to bottom the stations range from noon to early morning\nhours to midnight to evening to early afternoon sector (see\nFigure 7c). Station names, acronyms, and locations are\ngiven in Table 1.\n[31] Data from all 77 magnetometers were investigated by\na spherical elementary current system analysis [Amm, 1997;\nAmm and Viljanen, 1999], which allows the ground mag-\nnetic data to be converted to ionospheric equivalent current\ndensity patterns (Figure 7c). The latitudinal spacing of the\ngrid used for the elementary systems was 5\u0001, the longitudinal\nspacing was 10\u0001 and the total of 360 elementary systems\nwere placed at an altitude of 100 km. Stability of the solution\nto the underdetermined problem was obtained by using\nsingular value decomposition. It should be noted that large\nspatial gaps in the data, especially over central Russia, result\nin unreliable estimates of the equivalent current patterns\nthere. However, in the areas relatively densely covered by\nrecording stations (Fennoscandia, Northern America, and\nGreenland), the estimates for the equivalent currents can be\nregarded as reliable. Figure 7c shows the current pattern at\ntwo time instants around the shock arrival, at 1641 and at\n1643 UT. (Location of the magnetometer stations are also\nindicated in the figure.) The dayside currents were strongly\nenhanced shortly after the shock arrival at 1641 UT. At 1643\nUT a strong westward current was developed near midnight\nas well. The global ionospheric current patterns are the\nsubject of a separate study.\n[32] Figure 8 shows data from the Los Alamos particle\nanalyzers onboard three geostationary satellites, 1991-080,\n1994-084, and 1989-046. The spacecraft were distributed in\nlongitude such that at the storm onset, s\/c 1994-084 was\nclose to local midnight, whereas s\/c 1991-080 was near\nmidnight around 00 UT. Local noon and\/or midnight are\nmarked in the figures by arrows. At the storm onset, the\nlower energy electron fluxes increased at all three locations,\nwhereas the highest energy channels in all locations showed\na decrease of fluxes. This behavior is a characteristic\nresponse for an interplanetary shock arriving at the magne-\ntopause. After the storm onset, the spacecraft near midnight\nrecorded gradually decreasing values, with the first injec-\ntion-like signatures at around 18 UT. Throughout the period,\nboth electrons and protons (not shown) showed irregular\npulses in the energy range below 1 MeV, typical of the\nstormtime injections [Reeves and Henderson, 2001]. The\nlack of clear (dispersionless) particle injections during\nthe storm main phase makes it more difficult to use these\ndata for substorm identification and timing. The flux drop-\nout at s\/c 1989-046 at 1816 UT indicates that the spacecraft\nmoved across the magnetopause to the magnetosheath. This\nobservation can be confirmed by analyzing the spectro-\ngrams utilizing the full energy range from 10 eV to 10 MeV\n(data not shown). This observation confirm the GOES\nobservations of the magnetopause crossing, but further\nindicates that the magnetosphere was compressed even at\nlocal time 0715 far away from local noon in the morning\nsector.\n[33] In the following analysis, we summarize the behavior\nof the eight activations that are marked with dotted lines in\nFigure 6. For each activation, we briefly describe the\ndeveloping ionospheric current pattern and relate that to\nthe geostationary measurements.\n[34] The first activation was marked at 1708 UT. Close\ninvestigation of Figures 6 and 7b shows that the disturbance\nwas driven by the solar wind (southward turning of BZ and\nincrease of the \u0001 parameter), and that the disturbance\npropagated from the dayside stations toward the nightside.\nFurthermore, the spacecraft 1994-084 located close to mid-\nnight showed no signs of a particle injection near geosta-\ntionary orbit. There was a proton signature at 1991-080 and\n1984-084. The dispersion signatures indicate that this injec-\ntion originated from very far in the dawn sector. Thus, rather\nthan developing like a typical substorm with a nightside\ninitiation, this activation seemed to be caused by enhanced\nconvection, which in turn was driven by enhanced energy\ninput to the system.\n[35] The onset of the second activation at 1805 UT took\nplace at low latitudes, with the strongest disturbance at the\nHAN station of the IMAGE magnetometer network at about\n62\u0001 geographic latitude. The onset was extremely sharp\nwith time derivatives exceeding 5 nT\/s at the southernmost\nIMAGE stations. On the other hand, the disturbance was\nrelatively short-lived lasting only about 30 min. This onset\ncoincided with a clear injection at geostationary orbit near\nmidnight, to the east of the IMAGE magnetometer chain.\n[36] The activation marked at 1910 UT is difficult to time,\nas the activation started at the high-latitude (e.g., BJN at\n74\u0001) stations at 1850 UT and the disturbance propagated\nequatorward to the auroral zone stations, which showed\nonset features at successively later times. At about 1910 UT,\nin a location conjugate to the magnetometers, geostationary\nelectron fluxes showed a possible injection or a flux\nrecovery.\nHUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM SMP 15 - 11\nFigure 7a.

There was a coincident\nsmall injection or flux recovery at geostationary orbit.\nThe onset at 2055 UT was initiated from low latitudes\n(NUR\u2013OUJ, 61\u0001\u201365\u0001 latitude). This event was charac-\nterized by sharp gradients at the southernmost IMAGE\nstation NUR. There were no injection signatures at geo-\nstationary orbit. The activation at 2216 UT started from\nthe latitudes 61\u0001\u201362\u0001 and propagated poleward, and was\nalso not associated with injection signatures at geostationary\norbit.\n[38] Finally, two large onsets took place at 2315 UT and\n0030 UT. The 2315 UT onset initiated from the southern\nstations (NUR, 61\u0001), and was associated with very large\ngradients in the local magnetic field. This activation was\ncoincident with a short-lived injection near local midnight.\nThe solar wind and IMF data show a deep minimum of the\nIMF Z-component followed by strongly oscillating and\nenhancing solar wind pressure. This onset was thus likely\nassociated with the strongly enhanced energy input and the\ndynamic variations in the magnetosphere caused by the\noscillating plasma pressure. The last onset at 0030 UT\ninitiated from NUR (61\u0001), and followed the final northward\nturning of the IMF.\n[39] In summary, out of eight activations, four showed\nsubstorm-like behavior (1805, 2013, 2315, and 0030 UT,\nexpansion from an initiation region mainly poleward and\nwestward, electrojet enhancement associated with injection\nsignatures at geostationary orbit). Four activations showed\nquite different behavior (1708, 1910, 2055, and 2216 UT),\nwith typically activation spreading either from the west\neastward and equatorward or from the north equatorward.\nThese activations were not associated with clear injection\nsignatures at the nightside geostationary orbit. Therefore,\nour interpretation is that their morphology is quite distinct\nfrom the classical substorm sequence [Akasofu, 1964; Baker\net al., 1996].\n[40] In order to illustrate the behavior atypical for sub-\nstorms, we discuss two of the nonsubstorm activations (the\n1708 UT initial onset and the 1910 UT activation) and one\nsubstorm onset (1805 UT) in more detail. Figure 9 shows\nselected stations from the IMAGE magnetometer chain and\ndata from two LANL particle analyzers onboard two geo-\nstationary spacecraft. As pointed out above, spacecraft\n1991-084 was located to the east of the IMAGE magneto-\nmeter chain, while spacecraft 1991-080 was located to the\nwest of the IMAGE chain. Thus, either of the spacecraft\nshould be able to record substorm onset-associated electron\nflux enhancements, if the onset was visible in the IMAGE\nmagnetometers.\n[41] The top panel shows data from five IMAGE stations,\nordered from north to south, ranging from 74\u0001 to 60\u0001\nmagnetic latitude. The solid gray lines indicate the equator-\nward expansion of the events 1708 UT and 1910 UT.\nFurthermore, these two events show no clear associated\nchanges in the geosynchronous particle fluxes.

Both injections are dispersion-\nless. This indicates that the injection front is wide enough to\nengulf both spacecraft, and that the injection front expanded\nfrom the tail earthward.\n[42] Strong westward electrojet enhancement associated\nwith an earthward propagating injection front is a typical\nsubstorm onset sequence, as demonstrated in numerous\nearlier studies [e.g., Baker et al., 1996, and references\ntherein]. Therefore, despite the ongoing storm activity, the\n1805 UT onset seems to have the major characteristics of a\nsubstorm onset. On the other hand, the two other electrojet\nenhancement clearly show propagation from the poleward\nedge of the auroral oval toward lower latitudes. If one\nassumes that the substorm current system is associated with\nFigure 9. Five selected stations from Image magnetometer chain ordered from north to south (top).

Furthermore, neither of the onsets show\nsignatures of electron injection, either westward or eastward\nof the magnetometer chain. This further demonstrates a lack\nof current disruption and major magnetospheric reconfigu-\nration that would be expected for a substorm onset. There-\nfore, even if in magnetic indices these disturbances can look\nquite similar to substorms, their dynamic evolution is quite\ndifferent.\n[43] Some of the activations (1708, 2216, 2315, and 0030\nUT) could clearly be associated with changes in the solar\nwind and IMF parameters either southward or northward\nturning, and thus their timing was controlled by these solar\nwind variations. On the other hand, the onsets at 1805,\n2013, and 2055 UT seemed to occur without an apparent\nsolar wind trigger, and thus occurred as a consequence of\nmagnetospheric dynamics. Note that the onset at 1910 UT\nwas associated with small increase in epsilon due to slight\ndecrease of IMF Z-component but it is unclear if this can be\nconsidered as an external control at the onset. The onsets\nmoved toward lower latitudes as the storm progressed such\nthat the last four onsets all initiated well equatorward of the\ntypical auroral oval region. This is of course a consequence\nof the storm-associated equatorward motion of the auroral\noval and electrojet pattern. The strong solar wind pressure\nthroughout the main phase, which pushed the magnetopause\ninside or close to the geostationary orbit throughout this\nperiod, enhanced the dynamic coupling with the solar wind\nand the magnetosphere. However, even under such circum-\nstances the magnetosphere produced activations independ-\nent of the solar wind variability.\n[44] Two increases in the SYM H index were observed at\n2315 and 0015 UT. The first coincided with a substorm\nonset, but also with a rapid change in the solar wind driver\nproperties. The second increase preceded the substorm\nonset, but was coincident with an IMF northward turning.\nThus, in this event the substorm activity did not seem to\nlead to marked changes in the midlatitude magnetic record-\nings; rather the SYM H responded directly to the driving\nsolar wind and IMF properties.\n3.5. Geomagnetically Induced Currents\n[45] The induction phenomena driven by ionospheric\ncurrent systems are the ground end of geomagnetic storms.\nThe electric field produced by the rapidly varying magnetic\nfield induces an electric field inside the Earth, which drives\ncurrents in long man-made conductor systems, causing\nharm to power systems and buried pipeline networks\n[e.g., Boteler et al., 1998]. The geomagnetically induced\ncurrents (GIC) flowing in the Finnish natural gas pipeline\nnetwork have been measured since November 1998 [Pulk-\nkinen et al., 2001] in Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8 (Figure 10a) at the center of\nthe network. The measurements are realized by placing a\nmagnetometer above the pipeline, which then measures the\nBiot\u2013Savart field produced by the current flowing along\nthe pipeline.\n[46] The GIC flowing in the Finnish pipeline during 6\u2013\n7 April 2000, is shown in Figure 10b together with the\ntime derivative of the north component of the ground\nmagnetic field (dX\/dt) as measured at the nearby NUR\nstation. Positive direction of the GIC is chosen to be\neastward. As demonstrated in Figure 10b, there is good\ncorrelation between the GICs and dX\/dt. In general, the\nmagnitude of the time derivative of the geomagnetic field\nis a good indicator of the GIC intensity [Viljanen et al.,\n2001].\n[47] At the storm onset, the sudden impulse caused a\npulse-shaped structure in the ground magnetic field. The\npulse produced a time derivative of about 1.3 nT\/s at NUR,\nwhich was associated with a 3.5 A GIC at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8, with\nGICs over 1 A recorded over a 5 min period.\n[48] At 1807 UT, following the substorm onset, a very\nintense GIC event took place. Both polarities of dX\/dt and\nGIC were observed, with peak-to-peak amplitudes of 15 nT\/\ns or 34 A, respectively. GICs over 1 A were observed for\nabout 7 min. During the time period 1950\u20132200 UT,\nseveral intense GIC spikes were recorded. The 2055 UT\nspike was associated with an extremely localized disturb-\nance at NUR, which occurred coincident with one of the\nactivations without clear substorm onset signatures dis-\ncussed above.\n[49] At 2305 UT, Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8 was under the enhanced\nwestward electrojet region. Changes in the electrojet ampli-\ntude (dX\/dt \u2019 \u00012 nT\/s) caused a smooth westward GIC of\n\u00015 A prior to the substorm onset at 2315 UT. The peak\nvalues of dX\/dt and GIC at 2325 UT, were 5 nT\/s and 23 A.\nGICs over 5 A were observed for a period of about 10 min,\nand intensifications and weakenings of the substorm elec-\ntrojet caused the GIC to oscillate rapidly throughout the\nsubstorm. During the substorm recovery phase, rapid oscil-\nlations of the GICs having amplitudes of several amperes\nwere observed.\n[50] At the end of the stormmain phase, 0000\u20130130UTon\n7 April, several intense dX\/dt and GIC values were observed,\nthe largest ones being\u000114 A and\u00013.5 nT\/s, associated with\nthe changes in the westward electrojet. During the storm\nrecovery phase (0200\u20130430 UT) magnetic pulsations in the\nPc5 range (150\u2013600 s) caused GIC activity with amplitudes\nof several amperes.\n[51] The three most intense GIC events were all associated\nwith activations, at 1805, 2055, and 2315UT. However, there\nwere no common characteristics in the substorm behavior\nthat could be associated with these events: The 1805 UT\nsubstorm was driven by internal magnetospheric processes.\nFigure 10a.

On the other hand,\nthe 2315 UT onset was closely associated with the pulsating\nsolar wind pressure just behind a strongly negative IMF BZ.\nThe processes that led to these extreme temporal magnetic\nfield gradients and hence the GIC events will be investigated\nfurther in a separate paper.\n4. Discussion\n[52] The detection of a full halo CME and accompanying\nsolar activity near the center of the solar disc raises attention\namong space weather forecasters. Despite the western\nlocation of the halo CME detected by LASCO on 4 April\n2000, and the associated solar activity (filament disappear-\nance and C-class flare), the largest magnetic storm of the\nyear 2000 took place 2 days later. In this paper we have\nmade a thorough analysis of this storm using observations\nfrom the solar wind upstream of the Earth, dayside and\nnightside magnetosphere, auroral ionosphere as well as of\nthe geomagnetically induced currents.\n[53] A strong interplanetary shock was detected at 1 AU on\n6 April by several spacecraft monitoring the solar wind. After\nthe shock passage, the spacecraft encountered the sheath\nregion plasma. This storm was caused by the very strong\nsheath region, as at the time of the arrival of ICME signatures\naround 06UTon 7April the stormwas already in the recovery\nphase. After the start of the ICME signatures the magnetic\nfield intensity decreased within a couple of hours to very low\nvalues (about 5 nT) suggesting that spacecraft intercepted the\nICME far from its center. Various mechanisms that can cause\nintense southward (or northward) magnetic field values in the\nCME sheath region have been suggested [Gosling and\nMcComas, 1987; Tsurutani and Gonzalez, 1997], and Tsur-\nutani et al. [1988] have shown that the sheath regions alone\ncan drive intense (Dst < \u0001100 nT) magnetic storms.\n[54] Many observations described in sections 3.1, 3.2, and\n3.3 suggest that the spacecraft and the Earth hit only the\nflanks of the ICME. Most of the CME material in corona-\ngraph images and the associated activity, the flare (N18W58)\nand the filament disappearance (N25W58) occurred near the\nwestern limb of the Sun. Solar wind measurements also\nFigure 10b. (top) Geomagnetically induced current measured in Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8, Finland, and (bottom) time\nderivative of the north component of magnetic field at the closeby station Nurmija\u00a8rvi.\nSMP 15 - 18 HUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM\nsupport this scenario as described above. Solar wind signa-\ntures characteristic to magnetic clouds [Zwickl et al., 1983;\nGosling, 1990;Henke et al., 1998] (low beta and temperature,\nenhanced O+7\/O+6 and na\/np ratio, counterstreaming supra-\nthermal electrons) and the association to the filament dis-\nappearance suggest that the launched CME had magnetic\ncloud topology. As spacecraft intercepted only flanks of this\nmagnetic cloud we could not calculate its orientation from\nmagnetic field data. But as the associated filament was\nvertically elongated along the surface of the Sun we can\ninfer that the magnetic cloud likely was highly inclined\nrelative to ecliptic plane [Marubashi, 1997]. The obtained\nshock normal had large latitudinal angle, q \u2019 \u000140\u0001\nconsistent with source in the Northern Hemisphere and\nthe longitudinal angle f \u2019 170\u0001 that is consistent with the\nCME originating from west but the deviation from 180\u0001 is\ntoo small to be consistent with the flare and filament\nlocation near the western limb. However, as we discussed\nin section 3.2 the determination of the shock normal for\nthis event was difficult and above mentioned values should\nbe considered only as rough estimates. Note, that as the\nshock front is not planar but curved around the ejecta, the\naxis of the magnetic cloud should have had positive\ninclination relative to the ecliptic to explain the large\nnegative latitudinal angle of the shock normal. Finally,\nthe magnetosphere compression was stronger at the dawn-\nside than at the duskside. In the case of a magnetic cloud\nhaving its axis lying in the ecliptic plane and passing the\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere mostly dawnside we would expect\na much larger longitudinal angle and smaller latitudinal\nangle. Thus, a magnetic cloud having high inclination is\nmore consistent with the obtained shock normal orientation\nthan a magnetic cloud lying in the ecliptic plane. Summa-\nrizing all observations we suggest a scenario where the\nmagnetic cloud expanded from the Sun to the interplan-\netary space somewhat away from the Sun\u2013Earth line with\naxis having high positive inclination with respect to the\necliptic plane. This magnetic cloud swept the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere from above and dawnside so that the\nmeasured ICME signatures exhibit lower edge of this\nlarger scale structure. As there is still lot of uncertainties\nconcerning the 3D structure of the ejecta and the data are\nlimited it would not be correct to speculate any further.\n[55] Besides CMEs, corotating interaction regions (CIR)\n[Smith and Wolf, 1976] sometimes drive intense magnetic\nstorms. However, we do not believe that this solar wind\nevent was a CIR as the observed shock on 6 April was\nstrong and CIRs are fully developed (with forward and\nreverse shocks) only beyond the Earth orbit. Also the\nmagnetic field direction within the developing CIRs fluc-\ntuates rapidly so they do not usually cause very intense\nmagnetic storms [Gosling et al., 1991].\n[56] Usually, the long-lasting negative BZ events are\nassociated with ICMEs, particularly with magnetic clouds\nduring which the solar wind density and dynamic pressure\nare typically low. This event supports the view that the high\ndynamic pressure enhances the ring current injection\nthrough solar wind density driving of the \u2018\u2018superdense\u2019\u2019\nplasma sheet [Borovsky et al., 1997]. At the same time it is\nnot in contradiction with the results by O\u2019Brien and\nMcPherron [2000], who claimed that the pressure does\nnot have an independent role, as in this case the high\nplasma pressure was associated with long-lasting southward\nBZ. While Huttunen et al. [2002] showed that usually sheath\nregions cause relatively stronger Kp values than Dst values,\nin this event the negative magnetic field values were\nsustained exceptionally long for the sheath region, and thus\nboth Dst and Kp were greatly enhanced.\n[57] The geomagnetic activity was examined in detail\nusing ground magnetometer data from 77 stations around\nthe Northern Hemisphere polar, auroral, and midlatitude\nregions. Individual electrojet enhancements were identified\nand analyzed in the context of the generally accepted\nscheme of substorm evolution [e.g., Baker et al., 1996,\nand references therein]: In the ionosphere, the substorm\nonset is characterized by the onset of a strong westward\nelectrojet current with associated field-aligned currents\nforming the substorm current wedge. The expansion of\nthe magnetic disturbance (as well as the associated auroral\nbulge) is mostly poleward and westward. In the magneto-\ntail, at or near substorm onset time, the inner magnetotail\nfield becomes more dipolar, the energetic particle fluxes\nincrease rapidly, and in the midtail both earthward and\ntailward fast plasma flows are observed. These signatures\nare independent of the assumed substorm trigger mecha-\nnism. For this study, ionospheric data of the electrojet\ndynamics as well as inner magnetosphere energetic particle\nrecords were used to examine the substorm evolution.\nUnfortunately, no magnetotail data of the fast flows are\navailable for this event.\n[58] Using these criteria, only four out of eight clear\nelectrojet enhancements could be categorized as substorms,\neven if we allow for missing signatures due to possible lack\nof observations at the exact site of localized disturbance. In\nmost of these nonsubstorm cases, the magnetic disturbance\nwas observed to begin from high latitudes and\/or away from\nthe midnight sector, and the predominant travel direction\nwas toward midnight and equatorward. Furthermore, these\nactivations did not seem to be associated with configuration\nchanges in the inner magnetotail (either particle injections\nor magnetic field dipolarizations, both of which can be\nobserved as flux-level changes in energetic particle obser-\nvations). Therefore, we assume that these activations were\ndirect responses to the solar wind and\/or IMF driving, and\nwere not associated with dynamic configuration changes in\nthe magnetotail.\n[59] Furthermore, several of the more typical substorm\nonsets, especially the last two large substorms, were asso-\nciated with clear changes in the solar wind and IMF\nconfiguration, thus suggesting that they were driven by\nthe external driver [Lyons, 1996]. Thus, it seems that during\nstorms ionospheric (and possibly also magnetospheric)\ndynamics is quite directly controlled by the solar wind\nand IMF variations, with only occasional situations where\nthe internal dynamics can evolve to a state where a more\n\u2018\u2018typical\u2019\u2019 substorm evolution (tail instability leading to\nsubstorm current wedge currents and auroral bulge develop-\nment) can take place.\n[60] In addition to the major \u2018\u2018onsets\u2019\u2019 discussed in detail\nhere, there was significant dynamic behavior observed as\nwell in the ground-based magnetometer data, in geosyn-\nchronous particle fluxes, as in other observations. These\nactivations were not large enough or sufficiently coherent to\nbe included in the onset list, but indicate the nearly\nHUTTUNEN ET AL.: APRIL 2000 MAGNETIC STORM SMP 15 - 19\ncontinuous forcing of the solar wind on magnetospheric\ndynamics. Some of these nonsubstorm activations most\nprobably share the properties of equatorward driving arcs,\nN-S-aligned auroral arcs, auroral streamers or poleward\nboundary intensifications as discussed by Henderson et al.\n[1998], Sergeev et al. [1999], and Lyons et al. [1999]. These\nstudies discuss the magnetospheric and ionospheric signa-\ntures associated with these auroral activations. They con-\nclude that while many of the physical processes involved\nare the same as during substorms, the manifestations are\nquite different because of the strong and continued solar\nwind driving.\n[61] This large magnetic storm caused the second largest\nGIC measured at Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8 since the beginning of continu-\nous observations in November 1998. So far, the largest GIC\n(32 A) was measured on 11 November 2001. According to\nstatistics based on magnetic data over several solar cycles\nand model calculations by Pulkkinen et al. [2001], GICs\nover 25 A can be expected once per year at the Ma\u00a8ntsa\u00a8la\u00a8\nsite. Thus, although not being extreme, the April 2000 storm\nwas a quite intense GIC event also in a statistical sense.\n[62] Intense GICs investigated in this study imply that a\nlarge portion of the ionospheric drivers of the large GIC are\nrelated to substorm activity. This makes perfect sense since\nsubstorms are capable of producing large temporal varia-\ntions in ionospheric current systems, which then induce that\nintense ground electromagnetic fields. However, no com-\nmon characteristics in the substorm behavior, that could be\nassociated with these events, were found. More importantly,\nthe detailed behavior of the ionospheric currents during\nthese events was different from case to case. This suggests\nthat both temporal and spatial structures of the geoelectric\nfield driving the GICs are highly variable. From the GIC\nforecasting point of view, all this means that if the time and\nplace of the substorm-related ionospheric current variations\ncan be predicted, also the time and the location of most GIC\nenhancements can be predicted. In order to compute the\ndetailed distribution of GIC in a specific technological\nsystem, one needs to know the detailed structure of the\ninduced geoelectric field. In light of this study, it is quite\nobvious that requirements for a good GIC forecasting\nmodel, capable of producing such detailed structures, are\nextremely demanding.\n[63] In this strongly driven case, it is interesting to note\nthat the Dst (as well as the high-resolution SYM-H index)\nevolution is completely decoupled from the high-latitude\nmagnetic variations. The original concept of a substorm was\nthat it is a smaller activation of which storms were com-\nposed [Chapman, 1962]. It has been argued that the\nenergetic particle injections at substorm onset provide the\npopulation necessary for the stormtime ring current forma-\ntion, and hence the substorm activity is an essential com-\nponent for the storm evolution [Davis and Sugiura, 1966].\nHowever, this view has been contradicted by several stud-\nies. For example, linear filter analyses suggest that Dst has\nhigh correlation with the driver parameters, whereas its\ncorrelation with the AE indices (indicating substorm activ-\nity) is lower [for a review, see McPherron, 1997]. As the\nSYM-H index seems uncorrelated with the high-latitude\nmagnetic activity, this would lend support to the conclusion\nthat substorms do not play an important role in the storm\nevolution. Furthermore, as many of the high-latitude acti-\nvations in the AE index are not substorms that would be\nassociated with injections at geostationary orbit, these data\nwould suggest that the substorm-associated energetic par-\nticle injections are not the primary cause of the intense ring\ncurrent formation.\n[64] The high dynamic pressure throughout the storm\nmakes this event quite exceptional. Therefore, more storms\nneed to be analyzed before the conclusions about the\nstormtime substorms or nonsubstorms and their role in the\nring current evaluation can be generalized. However, this\nstudy alone demonstrates that under high dynamic pressure\nand strongly southward interplanetary field, the magnetotail\ncan assume a much more driven state and possibly quite\ndifferent dynamical behavior than during the loading\u2013\nunloading sequence of isolated substorms. Furthermore,\nunder such circumstances, most of the ionospheric electrojet\nactivity is directly controlled by the IMF and solar wind\nvariations and do not seem to couple to dynamic magneto-\ntail processes.\n[65] Acknowledgments.
