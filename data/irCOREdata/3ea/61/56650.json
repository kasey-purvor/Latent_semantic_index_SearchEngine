The first is that learning is a fundamental and\nintegral part of the entrepreneurial process, in which the human, social and behavioural\nactivities are of as much concern as the economic aspects which are often highlighted.\nThe second proposition is a conceptual model which explains the entrepreneurial\nlearning process and can be applied in entrepreneurial education and development.\nEntrepreneurship is an inter-related process of creating, recognising and acting on\nopportunities, combining innovating, decision making and enaction; this is consistent with\ndefinitions by (for example) Shane and Venkataraman (2000), Learning is an emergent,\nsense-making process in which people develop the ability to act differently, comprising\nknowing, doing, and understanding why (Mumford, 1995), Through learning, people\nconstruct meaning through contextual experience and create new reality (Weick, 1995),\nBoth entrepreneurship and learning are inherently constructivist, behavioural and social\nprocesses. The term entrepreneurial learning therefore means learning to recognise and act\non opportunities, and interacting socially to initiate, organise and manage ventures.\nSummary of relevant literature\nAddressing the first question, of how people learn to work in entrepreneurial ways, the\ndominance of economics-based and entitative thinking is long-standing, although it\noffers a limited understanding of the human and social processes of entrepreneurship\nand learning (Davidsson et al., 2001), That is not to disregard the contribution of\neconomics, for although Schumpeter (1934) and Kirzner (1973) observed the importance\nof learning in the entrepreneurial process, Binks and Vale (1990) commented on the\nlimitations of economic theory in understanding the human, sociological and\npsychological aspects of entrepreneurial behaviour. Recent studies of entrepreneurial\ncognition, such as Mitchell et al. (2002) and Parker (2004) have been limited by the\ncognitivist paradigm of individual (not social) and cerebral (not behavioural)\nconceptualisation. The results can be seen in the algorithmic \u201cdynamic model of\nentrepreneurial learning\u201d produced by Minniti and Bygrave (2001), As Spinosa et al.\n(1997) observed, there is a need to move beyond such entitative and positivist approaches\nto entrepreneurship in order to create understanding of the human processes involved.\nThe main conclusion which can be drawn from the extensive writing on\nentrepreneurship education is that while education can provide cultural awareness,\nknowledge and skills for entrepreneurship, the \u201cart\u201d of entrepreneurial practice is learned\nexperientially in business rather than the educational environment (Gibb, 1993, 1996;\nGorman et al., 1997; Jack and Anderson, 1999), Learning must be explored as a\ncontextual and active rather than a purely educational process, which raises the second\nquestion, of whether a framework can be created to understand entrepreneurial learning.\nThe cognitive paradigm has also dominated the study of learning, and is limited by\nusing the concept of individual information processing to understand the human mind\nand the ability to learn (Gagne\u00b4, 1977; Bandura, 1986), Beyond cognitivism, Mead (1934),\nKolb (1984) and Mumford (1995) developed experiential and social theories of learning\nwhich combine action, conceptualisation and social practice, while the contributions of\nlanguage, constructivism and discourse in understanding learning have developed\nthrough the work of Kelly (1955), Vygotsky (1962) and Harre\u00b4 (1989), Wenger (1998)\ndeveloped a comprehensive social and behavioral theory of learning, including\ndimensions of meaning, practice, identity and community. This provides a conceptual\nfoundation for a model of entrepreneurial learning which accommodates social\nJSBED\n12,3\n324\nparticipation and human action as well as cognition, enabling advanced learning\ntheory to be applied to entrepreneurship. It also enables progression from individual\nconceptions of entrepreneurial learning (Deakins and Freel, 1998; Cope and Watts,\n2000; Rae and Carswell, 2001).\nThree concluding questions can be drawn from the literature on entrepreneurial\nlearning. First, how and why do people develop entrepreneurial identities? Second, how\ndo people learn to recognise and work on opportunities which arise from their social\nexperiences? Finally, how do people learn to create and manage enterprises through\ninterpersonal processes? By exploring these three questions, there is the potential to\ncreate new understanding of entrepreneurial learning. The methodology for this is\nproposed in the next section.\nMethodology\nThe methodology used in this study is social constructionist (Gergen, 1999), narrative\n(Polkinghorne, 1988) and interpretive (Schwandt, 1998), Narrative approaches have\nbecome recognised as valid methods in the interpretive study of entrepreneurship\n(Hjorth and Steyaert, 2004), In this case narrative is used to explore the entrepreneurial\nlearning process in the \u201clifeworld\u201d of the entrepreneur, gaining access to their accounts\nof their actions and interactions with others within their environment, their personal\nand business venturing, and their learning.\nThe research was undertaken in the creative media industry in the United Kingdom\nwhich features conditions of rapid change, significant risk and volatility, with\nopportunities for new venture creation and growth being highly apparent (Leadbeater\nand Oakley, 1999), However the entrepreneurial process and its learning dimension is\nnot well understood, with a \u201cmissing middle\u201d in public policy in relation to the learning\nand development needs of creative entrepreneurs (Raffo et al., 2000), Therefore new\nunderstanding of academic and practical value could be created, and whilst this would\nbe limited contextually it might be extended and applied in cultural entrepreneurship\nbeyond the UK and possibly in other sectors.\nThe study identified emerging entrepreneurs and followed their personal and business\ndevelopment through a series of in-depth life story interviews. The methodological\nchallenges which arose from this approach included the relational issues of selecting and\nmaintaining the participants\u2019 engagement in documenting their story; reflexivity, in\nmaking sense of the researcher\u2019s own interaction with the research participants, material\nand process; and interpretive, in creating meaning of wider relevance from the study.\nThe study was limited to three participants to enable depth rather than breadth of\ncoverage. They were identified through recommendation, networking and social\ncontact, then invited to participate. The criteria for selecting these participants\nrequired them to be currently running a cultural media business, differing in type from\nthe others selected; prepared to participate fully in the research; and intending to\nactively grow and develop their business in innovative ways. The participating\nentrepreneurs and their businesses, which were presented as case studies, included:\n. Sawari Culture, a mail-order business supplying entertainment and media\nproducts to the growing Asian market (Kal).\n. Blue Fish, a corporate design, identity and marketing agency (Tony).\n. Shires FM, an independent radio station group (Mike).\nEntrepreneurial\nlearning\n325\nThe researcher acted as co-author with each participant over a two-year period in\nwhich multiple life-story interviews took place to create an account of their experiences\nin business and personal development. The scope of the interviews included the story\nof their career and business to date and exploration of key learning episodes such as\ntheir reasons for deciding to start a business and subsequent experiences, changes and\nlearning points. Each interview was transcribed and coded against a set of 27\ncategories generated through discourse analysis (Potter and Wetherall, 1987), This\nallowed cross-case comparison of similarly coded speech extracts and theory building.\nRelated material gathered for supplementary and corroborative detail included social\nobservation of the participant in business meetings and other interactions,\nconversations with their colleagues, and sampling the creative and commercial\noutput of their enterprise. The material was edited into a draft case study and the\nnarratives were reviewed with the participants and compared, using the coding\nstructure, to develop the conceptual model of entrepreneurial learning.\nFindings\nThree major common themes were identified from the accounts, which related to the\nparticipants\u2019 learning and also connected with the conclusions from the literature\nreview. These themes consist of personal and social emergence; the negotiated\nenterprise; and contextual learning. Within these major themes, a total of 11 subsidiary\nthemes were identified. Together these constitute the triadic model of entrepreneurial\nlearning which is shown in Figure 1 and is followed by a description of the major and\nsubsidiary themes, illustrated by extracts from the case material.\nPersonal and social emergence\nPersonal and social emergence is the development of entrepreneurial identity,\nincluding early life and family experiences, education and career formation, and social\nrelationships. It includes the formation of a sense of self and of future aspirations. In\nFigure 1.\nTriadic model of\nentrepreneurial learning\nJSBED\n12,3\n326\nbecoming recognised as an enterprising person, people seek to renegotiate their\npersonal and social identities which express who they are, who they want to be, and\nhow they prefer to be recognised within their social context. The process of personal\nand social emergence is illustrated by this extract from Kal\u2019s story in the Sawari\nCulture case:\nI was working in my husband\u2019s print business, and I realised I wanted to do something more\nthan just the accounts. The industry was male dominated, most of our clients were Asian men\nwho thought that \u201cshe\u2019s just the wife, she does the book-keeping, that\u2019s all\u201d. At the time I\ndidn\u2019t challenge it, I thought this is the way it\u2019s supposed to be. I\u2019m not like that any more, I do\nchallenge it.\nIt was a major thing for my husband to understand that I wanted to do creative things\nbecause we\u2019d come from a very orthodox upbringing with set views about what girls and\nboys did. I started to do computer design work which I really enjoy. But there came a stage\nwhen I didn\u2019t want to be seen as just a wife and a mother. I wanted recognition as a person in\nmy own right. Something inside me said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right, I can do a lot more than this\u201d.\nThat made me realise that I wanted my own business, you have an idea for something you\nwant to do and you develop it. I want to achieve something for myself. It\u2019s not that I want to\nsay \u201cI\u2019ve done all this myself, created a business of my own\u201d, I can\u2019t do that. You have to have\nsupport from people and that comes in a lot of forms. But I\u2019ve always had this energy and\nbelief that I want to achieve something.\nKal\u2019s story exemplifies the creation of entrepreneurial identity through personal and\nsocial emergence, in which the four sub-themes of narrative construction of identity,\nthe role of the family, identity as practice, and tension between current and future\nidentity can be recognised.\nPeople construct their identity through narrating autobiographical stories in which\nthey are the central actor, as well as narrator and author. Their entrepreneurial identity\nis socially negotiated as they makes sense of their own identity and renegotiate or\n\u201cre-invent\u201d themselves in their own and others\u2019 perceptions through the stories they\ntell. Change and development occurs as learning experiences shape their personal and\nsocial identity.\nThe role of families is significant in shaping identities and actions. Entrepreneurial\nstories are constructed with reference to personal relationships with parents, spouses,\nand children. In turn, the relationship with family members is changed through\nentrepreneurship. This is especially the case within the \u201cfamily business\u201d as we see in\nKal\u2019s story, in which her identity is renegotiated within her family relationships,\nmarriage and children. The male participants talked of their roles as fathers and\nhusbands and of how they managed their business identities alongside the familial. It\nis apparent that the negotiation of roles and expectations, in which cultural and social\ntraditions, such as gender roles of husband and wife, father and mother, play an\nimportant part in the construction of identity. This family dimension cannot be omitted\nfrom a consideration of entrepreneurial development, although the dynamic changes\naccording to family circumstances (e.g. absent parents).\nPeople develop identity as practice from the personal and social activities, practices\nand roles which they experience, often through early employment. As Kal discovered\nher talent for creative design from experience, people learn how to apply their abilities\nwithin networks of social and industry relationships. These abilities, skills and\nknow-how are often applied in the core activity of the new enterprise.\nEntrepreneurial\nlearning\n327\nIn entrepreneurial stories, there is often tension between current and future identity,\nwhere dissatisfaction with existing reality is expressed through entrepreneurial action;\nthis may be the point where they \u201cbecome an entrepreneur\u201d. These can be powerful\nepisodes in which there is an emotional recognition that the experienced reality did not\n\u201cfeel right\u201d, which is not only a cognitive dissonance but also conative and affective\n(Festinger, 1957), Such decisions to create new ventures are often connected with the\nrejection of an unsatisfactory present, the urge to create a new reality and changed\nidentity. So people move from being dissatisfied employees, in work roles where\npractices and identities are defined socially by others and are at odds with what \u201cfeels\nright\u201d, to create new reality through their business ventures, enabling them to work in\nways consistent with their personal values and practices.\nIn terms of identity, the entrepreneurial act is translating imagined possibilities of\n\u201cwhat could be\u201d into enacted reality, taking responsibility for shaping future events. It\nis moving from assuming an identity defined by others, such as work and family roles,\ninto creating a new identity. It is to experience emotional uncertainties, drawing on\nresources of self belief which accompany this shift from being a participant to being\nthe \u201cauteur\u201d of an entrepreneurial drama. This change requires the actor\u2019s personal\nconfidence and self-belief that it \u201cfeels right\u201d and they are able to make it happen.\nContextual learning\nContextual learning occurs through participation in community, industry and other\nnetworks in which individual experiences are related, compared and shared meaning is\nconstructed. Through these situated experiences and relationships people can develop\nintuition and the ability to recognise opportunities. Such learning connects personal\nemergence with the negotiation of the enterprise, as people learn in their social context\n\u201cwho they can become\u201d and \u201chow to work with others to achieve their ends\u201d as well as\nthe realism of \u201cwhat can and cannot be\u201d.\nThis theme is illustrated by an extract from the Shires FM case which demonstrates\nMike\u2019s contextual learning and the three sub-themes of learning through immersion\nwithin the industry, opportunity recognition through cultural participation, and\npractical theories of entrepreneurial action:\nI started working in radio when I was 15. I did a few stints on hospital radio, then got into the\nlocal radio station for work experience, It seemed like a lot of fun, I wanted to be in there to do\nthings I could show were worthwhile.\nI did that at school, working evenings and weekends. I presented a programme of my own\nwhen I was 17 and kept it up at University, after that the same company offered me a\nmanagement trainee job running a tiny new radio station.\nI had to make things happen, it was sink or swim to make it work. Then I went to run a\nlarger radio station with real power to manage people. I learned that whilst I may have goals,\nvisions, targets, my job is to help other people achieve them because I can\u2019t do it on my own.\nFor six months it went very well, revenue and audiences grew.\nBut then there was a market downturn, the company went in a different direction and I was\ngetting increasingly fed up, I left, taking a huge risk, but the contradiction with what I\nbelieved was too much.\nThere was no commercial radio station here. So I put in an application for the licence when\nit was advertised. I found the shareholders and persuaded them that they wanted to invest.\nWe were outsiders but we won the licence and that\u2019s how I got to be running Shire FM.\nJSBED\n12,3\n328\nI hadn\u2019t liked the experience of having to do things in a radically different way from what I\nbelieved was right, and I\u2019d been successful, so it was an opportunity to run an organisation\nfrom scratch how I believed would work.\nI can tell you what works for us because I\u2019ve done it a number of times. It\u2019s part-art,\npart-science, part what-feels-right. How much notice did I take of research when I put together\nour radio schedule? Very little, I know what works. It\u2019s an approach, it\u2019s gut feel. We know\nour market place, we\u2019ve worked out our own answers and we\u2019re going to stick to them.\nMike\u2019s story recalls career-long learning through immersion within the radio industry,\nprogressing from \u201codd job person\u201d to broadcaster, producer, station manager and\nultimately to managing director. This supports the findings of Gibb Dyer (1994) and\nMitton (1997) who noted the profound influence of career experience on entrepreneurial\nformation. This includes the development of skills, expertise and social contacts from\nemployment. Such learning is relational, functional and problem-solving in nature,\nfinding out by participation and social interaction how things are done, and\nestablishing routines which work in given situations. It occurs, as Gibb (1996) relates,\nthrough discovery and experiential learning, providing the intuitive practices, skills\nand insights people use in creating their own businesses.\nPeople can learn to recognise opportunities and future possibilities through\nparticipating in social and industry networks. Mike noticed the gap in local radio for\nShires FM and acted on the opportunity to create a new venture within a context which\nhe knew. Prospective sense making is necessary to envisage the future and imagine\nhow the venture can be created, before all the necessary knowledge, circumstances or\nconditions exist. This is a process of creative, associative learning, of putting ideas,\nopportunities, technologies and resources together in new ways, and acting when the\nmarket and other extrinsic factors such as regulation and the absence of competition\nprovide advantage.\nMike related \u201cwhat works\u201d for him; entrepreneurs, through their experience and\ncontextual learning within the industry, develop such rules and practices. Such\nknowledge, gained from experience, intuition and sense making of \u201cwhat works\u201d, why,\nhow and with whom, constitute practical theories (Rae, 2004), These enable people to\nreduce risk through prior experience because they \u201cknow what they are doing\u201d.\nThe negotiated enterprise\nThe concept of the negotiated enterprise is that the business venture is not enacted by\none person alone, but through negotiated relationships with others. The ideas and\naspirations of individuals are realised through interactive processes of exchange with\nothers within and around the enterprise, including customers, investors and co-actors\nsuch as partners or employees. This extract from the Blue Fish case study illustrates\nthrough Tony\u2019s story the four sub-themes of participation and joint enterprise;\nnegotiated meaning, structures and practices; changing roles over time; and\nengagement in networks of external relationships.\nThree of us established Blue Fish when the firm we worked for went into liquidation. We\ndidn\u2019t try to keep the old clients and decided we\u2019d do things really honestly, be straight with\nclients, not bullshit our way into jobs, build it up steadily, everything that went wrong before\nwe\u2019ll do right. We rented a single room to work from and worked ludicrous hours to get off\nthe ground \u2013 survival was the name of the game. We didn\u2019t believe we were working hard\nenough unless we were working past midnight.\nEntrepreneurial\nlearning\n329\nBut with the long hours we became prisoners in our own company, and realised we\nwouldn\u2019t continue to enjoy it. We knew we had the seeds of something good but we had to\nwork out what we had done wrong and what we were doing right. We were messing around,\ntrying to find our feet, establish our credentials, starting to understand how we made a profit\nor a loss.\nOur accountant made us each write down what we wanted for this business, when we\nwanted to sell it, and what tone of voice we wanted to present to the market. We wrote down\nfour words between us: creative, effective, fun, and integrity. Those words summarised the\nbusiness and became our values. We agreed we wanted to be out of the business before we\u2019re\n50 with about \u00a32m each, so we wrote a 20-year plan to get the profitability levels and get\nourselves out of the business, putting in a strong management structure that would run the\nbusiness for us. Now we\u2019re bang on target, we work 40-50 hours per week but never more\nthan that.\nAs a team we were great at generating ideas and getting people fired up but awful at\nfollowing through to a successful conclusion. We suffered from failure to implement and\ncollective irresponsibility where no-one was responsible for making decisions. Now we\u2019ve\nestablished specific roles for each of us, we \u201cwork on the business not in it\u201d, and get things\ndone much faster.\nWe now aim to employ only brilliant people, not only different to us but better than us. We\ntry not to recruit people in our own likeness which is the classical mistake we made early on.\nWe make sure people fit into a specific role and it seems to work.\nThe founders of Blue Fish are joint participants in the enterprise with their employees.\nAs Wenger (1998) noted, \u201cthe enterprise is joint . . . in that it is communally\nnegotiated\u201d. A vital aspect of the entrepreneurial learning process is the ability to\nengage others constructively towards that end, and this is demonstrated in all three of\nthe cases. It is necessary for the founders to create shared belief in the new reality of the\nventure, and for this to become a means of realising personal dreams and aspirations\nthrough participative action. This sublimates individual identity to the collective\nidentity of the enterprise, aiming for mutually desired outcomes such as wealth\ncreation, economic survival or the production of a particular activity. This shared\ninterest is a necessary condition for joint enterprise, accompanied by a social learning\nprocess in which people learn to work together. Joint enterprise also involves\ncombining resources such as expertise, finance and technology to enact the business\nidea.\nAs Tony related, the founders of Blue Fish agreed four words which became their\nvalues. Within the enterprise, a distinctive culture emerges, based on negotiated ways\nof working which reflect both the founders\u2019 style, language, ambitions and ways of\nworking, and those of the employees. The founders hold formal power and ownership\nof the business, yet they must learn to recognise the participation of people within the\nbusiness, whose concerns and aspirations influence its culture, structures and\npractices. Conflict and disagreement often occur as an integral aspect of this\nnegotiation.\nJust as individuals develop practical theories in the joint enterprise, these theories\nand practices become a shared repertoire of \u201cwhat works\u201d; as in a community of\npractice, what is learned does not belong to any single person, but rather is dispersed\namong the community (Wenger, 1998; Devins and Gold, 2002), In creative enterprises,\nthere is often an emotional engagement between the people and the business, in which\nits distinctive culture is produced through the style, language, behaviours, and feeling\nbetween people. Terms such as \u201cpassion\u201d, \u201cbuzz\u201d, \u201cexcitement\u201d and \u201cfun\u201d describe the\nJSBED\n12,3\n330\nemotional life and energy of the enterprise which goes beyond rationality, for people\nare expressing themselves, their identities and their creative abilities, in the cultural\nproduction of the business, and sharing it with the audience. This quality of emotional\nengagement is often \u201cwhat works\u201d in creative businesses.\nIf the enterprise is successful it evolves and grows, becoming larger and more\ncomplex in operation and structure, and employing more people. Transitions from\ninformal to formal roles, relationships and structures accompany this process.\nSignificant changes in the founders\u2019 and other roles are inevitable as the business\ndevelops. Growth can be seen in terms of changing human and social behaviour with\nproductive interpersonal learning and negotiations around the enterprise, rather than\nsimply as an economic process.\nThis negotiated change in roles is related to entrepreneurial management, in\nwhich self-sustaining management capability develops through managers, teams\nand functional experts taking responsibility for managing the business (Stevenson\nand Jarillo, 1990), These mutual learning processes, integral to the growth process,\ndepend on managing employee relationships effectively, changing past\nexpectations, sharing practices, and resolving tensions and conflicts in\nrelationships. As people are employed by the business, they become socialised\ninto it and adopt its cultural norms of participation, behaviour and language. This\nis a learning process of cultural integration and identification by individuals as\nemployees in the business.\nThe following extract from the Blue Fish case illustrates the selective engagement\nby the enterprise in networks of external relationships. These are important in\naccessing social capital, opportunities and resources (Aldrich and Zimmer, 1986;\nGre\u00b4goire et al., 2001), This selectivity in influencing certain groups and developing the\nsocial network and perceptions around the business is an integral aspect of\nentrepreneurial learning:\nWe get nearly all our leads from referrals and networking. We recognised early on that there\nare a few people who become key recommenders, we concentrate on young brand managers\nand make them feel special as clients.\nWe know we can only work with certain types of clients, ones who actually want to listen.\nI\u2019ve always believed in really strong supplier-client partnering, between us we can create\nsomething that\u2019s fantastic. It doesn\u2019t feel right unless they\u2019re involved, it needs to be a\ntwo-way street.\nThis suggests that the customer is engaged as an active participant, not as a passive\nconsumer, and that more than economic value is being generated in the interchange;\njust as the producer is giving something of themselves, so the customer is identifying\nthemselves with the enterprise. Relationships and \u201crapport\u201d with some customers and\nsuppliers are more productive than with others. The skills of listening, negotiating and\nstorytelling are essential in maintaining effective relationships. The cultural identity of\nthe enterprise is being formed and enacted through the interactions with these external\ngroups. The enterprise depends on its identity, practices and the credibility of its story\nbeing accepted and understood within its chosen networks.\nConclusions and application\nThere is scope for wider application of the model in theoretical, educational and\npractical ways beyond the context of the case studies and the creative media industry.\nEntrepreneurial\nlearning\n331\nIt can be used to interpret other cases, since what has been observed within these cases\nis likely to be, to some extent, typical of such processes in entrepreneurial ventures\nmore generally. It is legitimate to generalise at the level of process and theory, in\nmaking sense of \u201chow things happen\u201d by interpreting a limited base of case studies\n(Yin, 1994), This is not to argue for empirical generalisation, but rather to propose that\nentrepreneurial learning is fundamental within human social development, and that\nthe positions developed in this model may be helpful and applicable in understanding\nthis.\nThe model does not make claims or assertions about people\u2019s cognitive processes.\nThere is, therefore, no basis for comparison with theories which propose rational or\neconomic understanding of entrepreneurial behaviour rooted in cognitive theory (for\nexample, Minniti and Bygrave: 2001; Mitchell et al., 2002; Shepherd and Krueger: 2002),\nAlthough cognitivism is pervasive and influential in the literature, as Gergen (1999)\nobserves, there is a strong case to be made against simply accepting this and it is\nequally valid to propose a social constructionist alternative.\nThe model instead builds on Wenger\u2019s (1998) social theory of learning by adapting\nit to the activity of entrepreneurial learning, in which some of Wenger\u2019s themes become\nmore significant than others, by emphasising the creation, recognition and\ndevelopment of opportunities. The model also draws on social constructionist,\nnarrative and antecedent theories such as constructivism and pragmatism, including\nMead (1934), Dewey (1938), Vygotsky (1962), Polkinghorne (1988), Shotter (1993), and\nGergen (1999), Until now, no theory of entrepreneurial learning based on social\nconstructionist thinking has been advanced. Therefore, and with reference to the\ncaveats above, this model is proposed as an original and distinctive concept which\nadvances understanding of entrepreneurial learning, both in the context of the creative\nmedia industry, and beyond it, using the conceptual tools of narrative and social\nconstruction.\nIt is proposed that there are at least two practical applications for the model. One is\neducational, the other for business practitioners. Educationally, there is a need for an\nholistic model of entrepreneurial learning which students can use to make sense of\ntheir own learning, practice and development, and the model can be used to assist this.\nThis can support the progression from \u201cteaching about\u201d and towards \u201clearning for\nentrepreneurship\u201d which is increasingly adopted in entrepreneurship education\n(Menzies, 2003), This encourages a conceptual yet practical approach to learning to\nparticipate in entrepreneurial working, based on personal development, on social and\ngroup behaviour, and on opportunity recognition within contextual boundaries. There\nis scope to develop the model for educational use, in entrepreneurship education and\nbeyond, in new venture creation, in business incubation, and in small firm growth\nprogrammes.\nThe model may also be of value to practitioners because it proposes that personal\nand social emergence and the corresponding transition in identity is a fundamental\naspect of the entrepreneurial experience, not simply skills and knowledge which are\nassimilated cognitively. For example the themes can be used to generate learning maps\nto reflect on personal learning. So it may be helpful for emerging entrepreneurs to use\nthe model as a structure to think through such questions as their personal and social\nidentity, how they negotiate their enterprise, and how they use contextual learning to\nJSBED\n12,3\n332\nrecognise opportunities and to develop their own repertoire of \u201cpractical theory\u201d from\nintuitive experience.\nReferences\nAldrich, H. and Zimmer, C.
