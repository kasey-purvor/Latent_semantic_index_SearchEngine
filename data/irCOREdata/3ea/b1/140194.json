Establishing successful corporate brand management practices rely upon\nthe identification of two factors. First, the mix of variables that comprise the corporate brand,\nand second, the development of a brand management system for understanding this process\nof direction and control.\nThis paper addresses these two issues and proposes six conventions of corporate branding\ndeveloped from pilot empirical work with a UK law firm and subsequent action research\nprogrammes conducted with a European not-for-profit organisation and a UK-based\nmanagement consultancy. These conventions build on the existing literature, offer some new\nperspectives and provide a set of guiding principles and practices.\nThe contribution of this paper, therefore, is to use the authors\u2019 empirical findings developed\nfrom existing models of corporate branding and, through an action research approach, to\nchallenge their construction and adapt them \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 to provide a practical\nprocess for corporate brand management and development. In doing so, the authors also\ncontribute to the convergence discussion that enfolds as the paper develops. Before\n3explaining the basis for the study and our main findings, it is important to consider the\nevolving definition of the brand concept.\nThe concept of the product brand\nThe concept of the brand can be traced back to product marketing where the role of branding\nand brand management has been primarily to create differentiation and preference for a\nproduct or service in the mind of the customer.\nWithin this field, there are a number of generally accepted definitions. These variously refer\nto the brand as \u2018a product or service, which a customer perceives to have distinctive benefits\nbeyond price and functional performance\u2019 (Knox, 2000) or \u2018a symbol serving to distinguish\nthe products and services of one company from another\u2019 (Kapferer, 1997).\nThe development of product branding over the past 30 years is characterised by layers of\nadded value built around the core functionality of the product or service to create and\nmaintain distinction in a particular market. The increasing sophistication of product brand\nmanagement techniques developed can be tracked over this period by the emergence of\nmetrics such as brand image (Boulding, 1956, Balmer, 1998) and brand positioning (Ries and\nTrout, 1982), through to brand identity (Kapferer, 1997). These refinements reflect both\nresponses to changes in the business environment and the development of deeper insights into\nthe nature and influence of the organisation as an intangible element in the marketing mix.\nA further stage in this evolutionary development of traditional product brand management has\nbeen the increasing influence of the organisation behind the brand and an increasing\nacceptance of its role in the creation of economic value. Worcester (1986) provides evidence\n4of a strong correlation between company familiarity and favourability, and research by Lane\nKeller and Aaker (1992) highlights the positive impact of the corporate brand on new product\nintroductions and product brand extensions.\nThe concept of the corporate brand\nCorporate branding draws on the traditions of product branding in that it shares the same\nobjective of creating differentiation and preference. However, this activity is rendered more\ncomplex by managers conducting these practices at the level of the organisation, rather than\nthe individual product or service, and the requirement to manage interactions with multiple\nstakeholder audiences.\nThere is support in recent literature for an increasing focus on the role of the organisation as a\nstrategic element in the branding process (Abratt and Mofokeng, 2001; Cheney and\nChristiansen, 1999). It also highlights some of the problems inherent in managing a wider set\nof variables associated with the organisation.\nKing (1991) points to the fact that audiences for the corporate brand go beyond customers to\ninclude all stakeholders, and that these audiences exercise a wider range of discriminators,\nincluding both intangible and accepted tangible product\/service elements. Ind (1997)\nsupports the concepts of intangibility and complexity, highlighting the variety of points of\ncontact, or interfaces, between an organisation and its stakeholder audiences. Ind also\nintroduces the idea of responsibility, stating that a corporate brand has a broader social\nresponsibility or \u2018ethical imperative\u2019.\n5These differing characteristics find further support from Balmer (2001a), who highlights five\nkey elements under the C2ITE acronym. He states that corporate brands are cultural, as they\nreflect the organisation\u2019s sub-cultures, intricate in that they are both multidimensional and\nmultidisciplinary and tangible, as they encompass elements such as business scope and\narchitecture. Balmer also points to the ethereal characteristic of corporate brands as they\nevince emotional responses from stakeholder groups and the need for total commitment\nacross the organisation to manage a corporate brand successfully.\nIn summary, it is clear that during the last 30 years there has been a series of refinements to\nthe definition of the brand resulting in a dramatic extension of the applications and scope of\nbranding. Branding has begun to move up the corporate agenda and is increasingly\nrecognised as a strategic tool that can generate and support value creation (Urde, 1999;\nBalmer, 1999; Macrae, 1999).\nConfusion, convergence and conflict\nDespite a growing consensus about the benefits of corporate brand management (Fombrun\nand Rindova, 1998; Greyser, 1999), there remains considerable uncertainty over what this\nmeans in terms of management practices and the study of this emerging phenomenon. Lane\nKeller (1999) comments that many organisations are unsure what they should do to manage\ntheir corporate brand, whilst Ind (1998a) and Balmer (1998, 2001b) both highlight the current\nconfusion in the field and stress the need to understand the disciplines involved in managing\nand developing a corporate brand. Davidson (1999), in turn, calls for the macro management\nof the brand by senior management.\n6This suggests that there is a clear need to establish a new agenda and set of practices for\nbrand management at an organisation level. Our stimulus to explore these practices was\nfurther encouraged by two convergence trends. The first of these is the convergence between\nproduct and corporate branding.\nOver the past few years there has been increasing external demand for transparency and\naccountability of the organisation\u2019s policies and practices behind the product brands they\nmarket (Mitchell, 1999). During this period there have been a number of high profile\nexamples (e.g. Nike, Shell, Monsanto) where adverse publicity surrounding the actions of an\norganisation has had an immediate and dramatic effect on the brand at a product level and the\nshort term ability of the corporate brand to deliver economic value. The stronger links\nbetween product and corporate brand are also reflected in the latest survey of the world\u2019s\nmost valuable brands (Clifton and Maughan, 2000) where 19 of the top 20 companies listed\nshare the same corporate and product brand name. This trend shows signs of accelerating\nwith the recent emergence of new internet \u2018dot.com\u2019 brands where the corporate entity is very\noften the product or service.\nThe second area of convergence linked to corporate branding relates to the academic\nliterature. In a previous paper (Bickerton, 2000), it is argued that developments in\norganisation theory, starting from corporate image (Abratt, 1989) through to the current focus\non corporate reputation and corporate branding, have mirrored developments of the brand\nconcept in the marketing literature.\nFigure 1 traces the development of these concepts from a starting point of corporate image\nthrough successive organisational constructs, which reflect growing insights into the nature of\n7organisational branding. Each of these stages represented a widening of the impact of the\norganisation brand from corporate image and the customer (Abratt, 1989; Grunig, 1993) to\nthe broader definition of corporate personality and its relationship to the employee (Olins,\n1978; Barney, 1986). The next stage of this development was the recognition of the need to\ncreate favourable perceptions beyond customers and employees to include all stakeholder\naudiences with the introduction of corporate identity (Birkigt and Stader, 1986; Olins, 1995;\nBalmer, 1997).\nMore recent work in the organisational field focuses on corporate reputation (Fombrun and\nVan Riel, 1997; Rindova, 1997) and the need to satisfy the commitment of multiple\nstakeholders through the management of the corporate brand (Balmer, 2001a; Hatch and\nSchultz, 2001).\n8Figure 1: Convergence of academic thinking towards corporate branding\nMarketing\nPerspective\nCustomer\nFocus\nMultidisciplinary\nPerspective\nOrganisation\nFocus\nBalmer 1995, 2001ab\nHatch & Schultz 2001\nHarris & de Chernatony\n2001\nOlins, 2000\nKnox & Maklan 1998\nKing 1991\nDomain Starting point\nCorporate\nassociatio\nCorporate\nbranding\nFombrun & Van Riel 1997\nRindova 1997\nrporate\nsociation\nCorporate\nreputation\nBrand\nidentity\nBrand\npositioning\nBrand\nimage\nCorporate\nimage\nCorporate\npersonality\nCorporate\nidentity\nLane Keller & Aaker 1998\nInd 1998\nTilley 1999\nKapferer 1997\nMacrae 1999\nde Chernatony 1999\nUrde 1999\nRies & Trout 1982\nBoulding 1956\nAbratt 1989\nKennedy 1977\nGrunig 1993\nBernstein 1984\nOlins 1978\nBarney 1986\nBirkigt & Stader 1986\nOlins 1995\nBalmer 1997\nStuart 1999\n9In contrast, the marketing perspective (also shown in figure 1) has evolved from the principle\nof the primacy of customer demand. This views the brand as a strategic resource, which can\nbe used to guide the business processes that generate brand value for customers (Macrae,\n1999; Urde, 1999).\nMuch of the debate in the marketing field over the last 40 years has been on the mix of\nelements that not only delineate marketing as a discipline but also help to operationalise the\nrole and function of marketing. The goal of branding as it has evolved over this period has\nbeen to explore ways to add value to the basic product or service and thus create brand\npreference and loyalty.\nEarly attempts at brand management concentrated on creating a positive brand image\n(Boulding, 1956) in the mind of the consumer. This relatively simplistic idea was superseded\nby the development of brand positioning (Ries and Trout, 1982). This recognised the fact that\nconsumer choices are made on the basis of comparison and led branding practitioners to\nconcentrate on creating a unique positioning of their brand in the minds of existing and\npotential customers (Lane Keller, 1999).\nThis concept of positioning also linked with the term Unique Selling Proposition, and\ntogether with the 4Ps, have been the main building blocks of product brand marketing\npractice since the early 1960s.\nIn recent years, there has been a growing body of work which points to the inability of these\npositioning tools to cope with the substantially changed environment that organisations now\nface (Christopher, 1995; Mitchell, 1999). This created a need to deepen the marketing view of\n10\nthe brand to encompass organisational attributes (King, 1991) and to shift focus from the\nintegrity of the product brand to the organisation and people behind the brand.\nIn response to these views, Kapferer (1997) claims that we have now entered a new age of\nbrand identity, which can be viewed as comprising six variables: physique; personality;\nculture; relationship; reflection; self image. These variables define the brand and delineate\nthe boundaries within which it can change and develop. Support for this wider mix of\nvariables also comes from Ind (1998b) and empirical work by Lane Keller and Aaker (1992)\nwhich points to the increasing importance of corporate associations. This highlights the fact\nthat future marketing success rests upon the development of skills in brand building that\nharness all organisational assets and competencies to create unique products and services\n(Tilley, 1999).\nThe key to convergence of these two domains is, therefore, to recognise the legitimacy of\nboth an \u2018outside in\u2019 customer focus and an \u2018inside out\u2019 organisation focus. However, we also\nargue that the main constraint to further convergence between marketing and organisation\ntheory in this field is essentially the difference in starting point. So, there is a need to conjoin\nsome of these ideas and models to help resolve the divergence in theory development. To do\nthis, the authors first review the key models which describe corporate branding and corporate\nbrand management practices before discussing them in the context of their empirical studies.\nExisting models of corporate brand management\nThe development of models that describe the process of corporate brand management has\nmirrored the evolution of descriptive terms and ideas within the field and reflects the\ninherent complexity of the phenomenon.\n11\nA number of excellent reviews of these models already exist in the literature, (e.g. Stuart,\n1999, Balmer, 2001a). Both these authors identify that models of corporate branding can be\nsplit into two distinct types: the macro models of the 1980s and early 1990s and the more\nrecent micro models from the organisation and marketing fields.\nMacro models were developed by Abratt (1989) and Dowling (1993) and their major\ncontribution has been to incorporate the various constructs, such as corporate personality,\nidentity and image, into their models. Dowling takes a further step by incorporating\nconstructs such as culture from the organisational domain. Whilst these macro models do\nseem to have triggered the development of more multi-disciplinary interest, most appear to\nbe limited in terms of the insights they offer in explaining and connecting the constructs.\nIn response to these acknowledged limitations, a number of authors have recently developed\nmicro models of the corporate brand which are more accessible for diagnostic purposes. For\ninstance, Hatch and Schultz (1997, 2001) highlight three key aspects of corporate branding\n(vision, culture, image) and point to the need for managers to check for alignment between\nthese three elements. Rindova (1997) concentrates on the image formation process and\ndefines four distinct types of image that are created by the organisation, third parties and\nindividuals. This cascade process offers further depth of insight into the process of managing\ncorporate image. Rindova\u2019s work has recently been extended by Balmer (2000) who\ndeconstructs the key components of corporate identity. Balmer distinguishes five separate\ncomponents of identity (actual, communicated, conceived, ideal, desired) and suggests that\nall five should be explored by management as part of the corporate brand management\nprocess.\n12\nIn summary, the recent micro models of corporate brand management seem to capture more\nreadily the challenges faced by organisations in managing and aligning multiple identities and\nimages across differing stakeholder groups. However, even these models still tend to be\nrather conceptual at heart and, in our view, still present major challenges to researchers\nengaging in empirical studies of this emerging management phenomenon.\nDevelopment of our research study\nAs we discussed earlier, our review of the literature indicates that part of the tension in\ndeveloping this domain stems from the disparate and sometimes conflicting viewpoints of\ncontributing authors from different academic disciplines. A second contributory factor,\nundoubtedly, is that the corporate brand is an inherently complex phenomenon to understand.\nBalmer (2001a), in his recent critique of the corporate branding literature, identifies 15\nunderlying reasons behind this \u2018fog\u2019 of complexity which surrounds the subject area. Mindful\nof these complex issues ourselves, we have designed a study, which, coincidentally, seems to\naddress four of the main criticisms levelled by Balmer. The first of these criticisms relates to\nthe problems caused by different paradigmatic views (Goia, 1998). In particular, a number of\nauthors have pointed to the inappropriateness of the positivistic paradigm for studying this\nfield (Hatch and Schultz, 1997; Balmer, 1998).\nConnected to this, we believe, are two further criticisms raised by Balmer, namely the failure\nto identify elements of the corporate brand mix and how these elements are managed. Both\nstem directly from limitations of studying the field within a positivistic paradigm.\n13\nFinally, Balmer also points to a lack of empirical research which the authors believe can be\nattributed mainly to the challenges in operationalising predominantly conceptual models, and\nto the difficulties of gaining privileged access to study the phenomenon within organisations.\nIn response, our methodological approach has been to use an action-oriented form of inquiry\nto gain the necessary access to organisations and to study the processes of corporate brand\nmanagement at first hand. This methodology is outlined in the next section.\nMethodology\nThe study conducted was qualitative in nature and involved three phases. The first phase was\na detailed review of the literature to establish the current body of knowledge on corporate\nbrand management processes. Given the shortfall in empirical work and the complexity of\nthe phenomenon under study (ref: Balmer\u2019s 2001a paper for a full and comprehensive\nanalysis), the authors developed an action research approach based upon intervention theory\n(Argyris, 1973). This method of inquiry attempts to integrate reflection and action within\ncycles of intervention during the study. This intervention cycle was tested in a pilot study\nduring the second phase of study, which enabled the authors to develop suitable processes for\nthe collection and analysis of data. The study was conducted with a leading UK law firm\nover a period of three months and involved a cycle of interventions with senior partners,\nincluding workshops and face-to-face interviews, a total of 25 separate interventions. These\ninterventions were all recorded and transcribed and supplemented with project journals to\ncapture all researcher reflection between each intervention stage.\nDuring the third phase, which were conducted as two consecutive studies over a period of six\nmonths each, over 50 interventions with the senior management teams of the two\n14\norganisations were carried out. All cycles of intervention, which were conducted as face-to-\nface interviews or small group sessions, were recorded and transcribed for analysis. These\ntranscriptions were again supplemented by intervention journals, which were kept throughout\nthe studies to capture the researchers\u2019 reflections on the process and outputs at each stage. At\nthe end of each cycle of intervention, all transcripts and journal notes were analysed using\nqualitative software and emerging themes were generated from conceptually-ordered matrix\ndata displays (Miles and Huberman, 1994).\nThis methodology should be contrasted with conventional qualitative approaches, such as the\nrecent study by Abratt and Mofokeng (2001) where research was conducted at a distance in\nthe past tense by generating data with respondents on how corporate image was managed\nwithin a sample of organisations. In contrast, our study attempts to investigate the\nmanagement of the corporate brand in the present tense by active involvement in the process\nof research with the participating research subjects. The benefits of our approach stems from\nthe opportunity to generate diagnostic insights and corrective actions, as opposed to the more\nconventional, third person detached-observer study. Our main research findings are discussed\nnext under the heading of the six conventions of corporate branding.\nSix \u2018conventions\u2019 of corporate branding\nIn characterising the process of corporate brand management across the organisations we\nstudied, we have been able to identify a number of distinct practices. These emerging\npractices are explained in the following sections and we have termed them \u2018conventions\u2019 of\ncorporate brand management. A convention is defined as the \u2018prevalence of certain accepted\npractices, which offer a constraining influence\u2019. It becomes evident that these six\n15\nconventions link both to aspects of existing models and frameworks as well as providing new,\npractical guidelines for managing the corporate brand.\nFirst convention: Brand context \u2013 setting the co-ordinates\nKing (1991) and Balmer (1995) both identified the need for corporate branding practices to\nbe multidisciplinary, combining elements of strategy, corporate communications and culture.\nThis view has been further refined by Hatch and Schultz (1997, 2001) who point to the\ninterplay of three variables - vision, culture and image - as a context for corporate branding.\nEvidence from all three of our studies suggests that these variables do, indeed, form part of\nthe strategic setting which organisations use to review the current strengths and weaknesses\nof their corporate brand. However, initial cross-case analysis of the data suggests that a\nfourth variable should also be introduced to make the context more complete. This is the\ncompetitive landscape for the organisation.\nFigure 2: The context of corporate brand management\nCorporate\nBrand\nManagement\nimage\ncompetitive\nlandscape\nvision\nculture\nadapted from Hatch\nand Schultz (1997)\nMuch of the evidence gathered through interviews and focus groups from each organisation\nstudied identifies the need to consider the future competitive landscape (even in the case of\n16\nthe not-for-profit organisation which, whilst not selling conventional products, was\ncompeting for attention and funds). This suggests the development of a competitive context\nfor the corporate brand, which builds understanding across two temporal dimensions:\n\uf0b7 the current image of the organisation and its future competition.\n\uf0b7 the current culture of the organisation and its vision for the future.\nApplication of this model (figure 2) should help managers within an organisation \u2018fix the co-\nordinates\u2019 of their current situation by reference to these contextual factors. In addition, it\ncan help guide thinking on future scenarios for the organisation with reference to its vision\nand competitive strategy.\nSecond convention: Brand construction \u2013 the corporate brand positioning framework\nThe authors\u2019 literature review and interpretation of existing conceptual models stresses the\nneed to create a brand framework that combines \u2018inside out\u2019 and \u2018outside in\u2019 elements from\ncommon starting points (Van Riel, 1995).\nVan Riel defines the concept of common starting points (CSPs) as the central values of an\norganisation which form the foundation for all corporate communication. As discussed\nearlier, Ries and Trout (1982) refer to these values as brand positioning. Thus, there is a need\nfor management to address two important questions: what CSPs make up the corporate brand\nframework and how can they be used to position the brand?\nFor the pilot phase of our study, we used a framework for organisation brand positioning\nintroduced by Knox and Maklan (1998) from the marketing domain to explore these\nquestions. According to Sealey (1999), their positioning approach or \u201cunique organisation\n17\nvalue proposition\u201d applies at a corporate level in the way that the \u201cunique selling proposition\u201d\nhas been used in the past to position products through advertising (Kapferer, 2001). The\nresults of the pilot study point to an evolved, four-stage positioning that comprises\norganisational attributes and its performance, portfolio and network benefits. These\ndefinitions are outlined in figure 3.\nFigure 3: Corporate brand positioning framework: definitions\nadapted from Knox and Maklan (1998)\nEvidence from the two subsequent studies highlight the fact that the research subjects were\ncomfortable in identifying the tangible performance and portfolio benefits of the organisation,\nbut require a process to identify the key elements of their intangible organisational attributes.\nFurther, the network or relationship benefits were not considered at first by each set of\nsubjects to be a part of the corporate brand positioning. However, as part of the on-going\nintervention process, the potential of the network as defined emerged as a strong and even\ndifferentiating element in the corporate brand.\nOrganisation\nattributes\nNetwork\nbenefits\nPortfolio\nbenefits\nPerformance\nbenefits\nProducts - what an organisation does\nServices - how an organisation delivers\n\u2018Product Brands\u2019 - the outward faces of the organisation\n\u2018Customers\u2019 - who the organisation serves\nContacts - network of contacts used by the organisation\nMechanisms - informal and formal mechanisms that drive\nthe network\nPurpose - what an organisation exists to do\nValues - what guides an organisations actions\nCommitments - what\u2019s important to an organisation\n18\nTo aid the development of a shared viewpoint of this framework, we worked with the\nresearch subjects to identify a common starting point. Evidence from the studies points\ntowards the adoption of customer value drivers as an effective means to create group dialogue\nand alignment. This data was generated from both existing external customer research, and\nthe views of the research group based upon informal feedback from customers and other third\nparties.\nUsing customer value as a common starting point, the research subjects were able to\nconstruct a corporate brand positioning working from an understanding of the organisation\u2019s\ncurrent brand strengths and desired future position. This use of customer value drivers as a\ncommon starting point seems to provide a better basis for achieving consensus rather than the\nmore subjective and intangible starting point of corporate values (Van Riel, 1995) or, indeed,\nother CSPs that may arise as a result of feedback from key stakeholders other than customers.\nIt also seemed to help managers from cross-disciplinary backgrounds focus on common,\nunifying issues and to develop a shared understanding of the main considerations in\npositioning their corporate brand. This approach was also endorsed in our post-study exit\ninterviews as it was seen as helping overcome some of the inhibiting beliefs and behaviours\nassociated with the functional boundaries that exist in each of the organisations studied.\nThird convention: Brand confirmation \u2013 articulating the corporate brand proposition\nThe corporate brand positioning developed during the brand construction phase needs to be\nconsolidated and articulated to the rest of the organisation and external audiences. This calls\nfor the development of a series of agreed statements that describe the corporate brand\nproposition.\n19\nEvidence from our fieldwork suggests that this process must be inclusive for the senior\nmanagement team involved and is best conducted in an iterative style, via a series of small\nworking groups. Such an approach ensures management buy-in and begins the process of\ndeveloping an agreed corporate language for all organisation communications. Adoption of\nan agreed corporate brand positioning (figure 3) and common starting point, based upon\ncustomer value, gave the management team in each organisation a process for the\ndevelopment of these corporate brand statements and, ultimately, the brand proposition.\nAnalysis of our post-study exit interviews also points to broad agreement that the\ndevelopment of a series of brand statements enabled the management teams to create a fuller\ndefinition of the corporate brand, helping to resolve the complexity issues raised in the\nliterature (Balmer, 2001a).\nThe indications emerging from our project journals (maintained throughout the research\nperiod) suggest that the engagement and reflection of this senior management team is vital in\nsecuring the commitment and ownership necessary to enable corporate brand change and\nrenewal. Indeed, the authors believe that failure to enlist their enthusiasm and support\nseriously jeopardises the development of corporate brand consistency and continuity, which\nare explained next.\nFourth convention: Brand consistency \u2013 developing consistent corporate\ncommunications\nConsistency has been widely acknowledged as a core principle of successful brand\ndevelopment (Olins, 1995). Further, the literature also acknowledges the pivotal role of\n20\ncommunication in creating this consistency (Van Riel, 1995) and concentrates on this aspect\nof corporate brand management (Birkigt and Stader, 1986).\nEvidence from our study indicates that an organisation needs to divide its channels of\nstakeholder communications according to their levels of formality, by identifying both key\nformal communication channels and other informal mechanisms commonly found in\norganisations (e.g. e-mail, bulletin boards). This was seen as a necessary first stage in\nconducting a more rigorous audit of stakeholder communications. As an integral part of our\nstudy, content analysis (Krippendorf, 1980) was applied to measure the consistency of formal\ncorporate brand communications. This approach, which relies on quantified data analysis\ntechniques, enables managers to measure and monitor the output of all corporate brand\ncommunications against the brand statements created in the preceding brand confirmation\nstage.\nResults from our time series analysis of the European not-for-profit organisation identify a\nsignificant improvement in brand consistency over a nine-month period. Evidence of this\nimprovement was the increase from 40% to 62% in the proportion of core brand\ncommunications and a reduction in the fragmentation of communications regarding the core\norganisation attributes identified during the brand positioning stage (figure 3).\nThe adoption of a measurement tool (based upon content analysis) for all formal corporate\nband communications was considered to be of significant benefit to the management team in\nhelping to control and measure the consistency of formal communications. What began in\nthe study as an objective measure of output became recognised as a management tool offering\nconsiderable potential to the corporate brand team.\n21\nFifth convention: Brand continuity \u2013 driving the brand deeper into the organisation\nWhilst the main focus of the study conducted was on corporate brand communication, data\ngathered in all three organisations highlighted the importance of aligning the relevant\nbusiness processes with the corporate brand. This called for an examination of these business\nprocesses in order to review how they should be modified and developed to ensure continuity\nwith the corporate brand proposition (Knox and Maklan, 1998; Knox, Maklan and\nThompson, 2000).\nIn the case of the European, not-for-profit organisation this involved a series of workshop\nsessions with senior management to identify which business processes impacted on the\ncorporate brand and how these processes contributed to the delivery of customer value. The\nprocesses identified (communication, operations, knowledge management and strategic\ndevelopment: figure 4) were then discussed in the context of their current level of alignment\nwith the corporate brand to identify areas where these processes required adjustment or\nimprovement. In figure 4, communications and knowledge management are marginally\nbetter aligned than operations and strategic development, although all four have some way to\ngo to achieve organisation-wide consistency and continuity.\n22\nFigure 4: Corporate Brand Continuity: the Not-for-profit Case Study\nOperations\nCommunication\nKnowledge\nmanagement\nStrategic\ndevelopment\nIndividual\nP\nro\ndu\nct\ncentric\nP\nro\nd\nu\nct\nce\nn\ntr\nic\nIndividual\nCurrent\nposition\nCollective\nO\nrg\nan\nisatio\nn\ncentric\nO\nrg\nan\nis\nat\nio\nn\nce\nn\ntr\nic\nKey processes for\ncustomer value delivery\nCollective\nOne of the main conclusions from each study is that managers need to adopt a more holistic\napproach to corporate branding which also encompasses the business processes associated\nwith value delivery. In this way, brand confirmation is reinforced throughout the organisation\nby broadening the corporate brand managers\u2019 remit to include both changes in\ncommunications and the business processes engaged in value delivery.\nSixth convention: Brand conditioning \u2013 monitoring for relevance and distinctiveness\nA final stage of corporate brand management identified in the study centres on the ability of\nan organisation to review its corporate brand on a continuous basis. Evidence from each of\nthe organisations studied points to the need for regular auditing through its cycle of\ndevelopment and renewal. This finding, which supports the view of Abratt and Mofokeng\n(2001) that corporate brand management is a continuous process rather than a series of one-\n23\noff events, highlights the need for management to check on the brand\u2019s condition for\nrelevance and distinctiveness at regular intervals.\nData gathered from the study suggests that brand conditioning involves creating a hierarchy\nof customer value and ensuring that the corporate brand model delivers against these needs\non a continuous basis. The main benefits of the corporate brand are managed as the inverse\nof the customer value hierarchy to ensure relevance and distinctiveness (figure 5).\nBy constructing, articulating and communicating the corporate brand proposition (figure 3),\nmanagers can ensure that the brand retains relevance and distinctiveness with respect to this\nhierarchy of customer value. This creates a dynamic situation where corporate brand benefits\nare actively managed to align with the customer value hierarchy (figure 5).\nFigure 5: Aligning brand benefits against customer needs \u2013 brand conditioning\ncustomer value hierarchy\nbrand conditioning\nBasic level needs\nHigher\nneeds\nDifferentiating benefits\nQualifying\nbenefits\nlow\nhigh\nBrand\nrelevance\nand\ndistinction\nlow\nhigh\nLevel of\nbrand\ndifferentiation\nlevel\n24\nThe main implication for managers here is the need not only to communicate clearly the key\naspects of the corporate brand proposition, but also to ensure that these communications are\nreinforced by organisation behaviours and supported by the processes which deliver customer\nvalue.\nConclusions and limitations\nThroughout this paper, we have highlighted the increasing importance of the corporate brand\nand the need for a clearer focus on the mechanisms and processes that enable the senior\nmanagement team to develop their brand more effectively. The identification of the six\nconventions from our data sets can best be viewed together as a whole - as a set of guiding\nprinciples and practices which offer a new diagnostic approach to the management and\ndevelopment of the corporate brand (figure 6).\nThe progressive nature of these diagnostic stages, from setting the co-ordinates to monitoring\nfor relevance and distinctiveness, helps to bridge the gap between conceptual modelling and\noperational interpretation. Along the way, we have had to make adaptations and reductions to\nengage managers through action research. However, we hope their contribution can also\nprovide the academic community with material that contributes to the convergence debate\ndiscussed earlier in the paper.\n25\nFigure 6: The six conventions of corporate brand management\nEvidence from our work has also led us to propose a more holistic definition for the corporate\nbrand as follows:\n\u2018A corporate brand is the visual, verbal and behavioural expression of an organisation\u2019s\nunique business model\u2019.\nWhilst the development of the six conventions is based on empirical evidence, the authors\nreadily acknowledge that there are limitations to the scope of the work conducted to date.\nGiven the nature of the project and intervention methodology chosen for the study, our work\nhas concentrated on organisations where the senior management team can more readily\nengage in the process of inquiry. This has led to the selection of partnership-style\norganisations as the most suitable for preliminary study. Suggestions for further work,\ntherefore, are to test and develop the framework in the context of larger holding companies.\nFor reasons of access, our studies to date have consisted of organisations in the process of\nchange. The perceived need to re-examine the corporate brand has enabled access and\nBrand\nconstruction\nBrand\nconfirmation\nBrand\nconsistency\nBrand\ncontinuity\nBrand\nconditioning\nBrand\ncontext\nCorporate\nbranding\n26\nfacilitated the commitment of the senior management team over time by offering a mutual\nbenefit to both the organisation and researchers in studying the processes of managing their\nbrand. We recommend that further work should be conducted within organisations, which are\nnot undergoing radical change, for comparative purposes. However, we anticipate that this\nrecommendation may create significant research challenges in gaining sufficient access to\nand participation of a senior management team through several cycles of intervention,\nreflection and action.\nImplications for managers and academics\nOur emerging definition of the corporate brand builds on the views of Ind (1997) and Balmer\n(2001b) who regard the corporate brand as a unique entity which must take account of the\nspecific structure and culture of the organisation. Ind also identifies that there are no\nuniversal approaches to corporate branding. Evidence from our study supports this work as\nthe senior management teams in the organisations studied did not have formalised structures\nor processes for managing the brand at an organisation level. Empirical evidence points\ntowards the need for these six conventions to be addressed by corporate brand management.\nArguably, these conventions combine to give a further evolutionary step towards a more\nstructured approach to the management of the corporate brand. Further, our study suggests\nthat the role of corporate brand management is not a peripheral activity that can be delegated\nto a marketing or single communication function.\nBased upon the results of our action research, we would suggest the following steps to senior\nmanagement engaged in building their corporate brand:\n\uf0b7 Allocate responsibility and authority for corporate branding to one director or partner\n\uf0b7 Establish a senior corporate brand management team\n27\n\uf0b7 Use the six conventions individually to audit the corporate brand and, together, as a\n\u201cchecks and balance\u201d mechanism to ensure relevance and distinctiveness to stakeholders\nover time.\nReferences\nAaker, D.A. and Joachimsthaler, E.
