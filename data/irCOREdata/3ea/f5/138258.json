Following a\nliterature review of the temptations to which leaders succumb, the results of focused\nand intimate case studies of highly respected leaders highlights just what they are\ntempted with and how and why they particularly may succumb to hedonism, power\nand posterity. Extracts of interviews with an international sample of Chief Executive\nOfficers (CEOs) and significant others reveal a distinctly human experience from\nwhich it is considered no-one is exempt. Included in the sample were female top\nmanagers but no discernable difference between the genders could be ascertained.\nThe idiosyncratic nature of response to temptation positioned each interviewees\nexperience as unique. It is concluded that certain measures need to be implemented in\norder to control and reduce the darker human tendencies when exposed to certain\nconditions.\nKey words: Leadership, temptation, power, hedonism, posterity.\nIntroduction\nThroughout history, individuals attracted to, and successful in, leadership roles have\nbeen characterised to display a strong desire to pursue their personal interests in\naddition to that of the cause or organisation they head. The sheer strength of their\npower often lies in their ability to influence, convince and perhaps even to manipulate\nothers to support their agendas. President Harry S. Truman (Donovan, 1996)\n3acknowledged both the motivational and influential elements of leadership. He\ndefined a leader as \u201ca man or woman who can persuade people to do what they ought\nto do \u2026 without being persuaded. They must also have the ability to persuade people\nto do what they do not want to do and like it\u201d.\nOnce this level of power is achieved the balance between organisational good and\npersonal interest can become blurred. Whether the successful leader is benefiting\npersonally from organisational focus or the organisation from their personal focus, is\nin many circumstances not clear. In fact, is the leader gearing the organisation to their\nown personal agenda or are they benefiting from the organisational vision by default\nafter altruistic action? If personal pursuit is more likely then the organisation is\nplaced in a vulnerable position.\nA rich normative literature exists on how individuals in leadership roles should\nexercise their discretion externally in their roles, but much less considered attention\nhas been given to the personal and internal regressions of leaders (Kakabadse and\nKakabadse, 2005). Such scrutiny is considered as apposite as a recent scrutiny of\nscandals involving leaders has emerged in the popular press. Dennis Kozlowski of\nTyco, Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom, Marta Stewart of Marta\u2019s Lifestyle and Jack\nWelsh of GE are just a few examples of the CEO leaders who were originally\nperceived as individuals of high character, able to think independently and epitomise\nvalues and principles for others to follow. Whatever their supposed principles, recent\npopular articles highlight an apparent abuse of their privileged position. In\nexploration of this transgressions of leaders Aristotle (1911) recognised that\n4continuously behaving morally is challenging, not only due to personal weakness, but\nalso due to facing conflicting moral principles.\nIn antithesis to texts that highlight the attractive side to leaders, in this paper we\npresent the findings of a qualitative study that explores the darker side - the\ntemptations of leaders. Exploration focuses on the desires of a sample of Chief\nExecutives who admit to being consciously aware that particular pursuits and acts are\nmorally wrong but nevertheless find themselves unable to resist. Temptation as a\nconcept itself is tackled before a case study approach is adopted highlighting the\ncritical temptations to which each leader became susceptible. In conclusion,\nsuggestions on possible strategies that leaders can adopt to guard against temptation\nare presented.\nTemptation\nOriginating from the Latin word tentare, meaning to test, temptation relates to a\n\u2018seductive feeling\u2019 or the desire to have or do something that one knows is best to\navoid. As such, temptation is the test of an individual\u2019s will when confronted with an\nobject considered attractive and\/or displaying alluring qualities. Notably, this implies\nchoice on the part of an individual whether to succumb or resist desire. Numerous\nframeworks have evolved to explain leader\u2019s behaviours through a variety of\nperspectives.\nThe developmental school of thought (Kohlberg, 1969; Weber, 1990; Trevino and\nBrown, 2004) distinguishes between four hierarchical stages of ethical development\nthat move from moral awareness to moral judgment (i.e. deciding that a specific\n5action is morally justifiable), then to moral motivation (i.e. intention to undertake\nmoral action) and finally to moral character (i.e. the pursuit of that chosen action\ndespite challenges).\nSimilarly, theologicians differentiate between three hierarchical states of temptation\n(Zaehner, 1988):\n\uf0b7 \u201cBeing tempted\u201d - a state of awareness of one\u2019s desire.\n\uf0b7 \u201cEntering into temptation\u201d \u2013 a state where one has not enacted temptation but\ncontemplates whether to fulfil that desire rather than weighing up the\nconsequences of doing so.\n\uf0b7 \u201cGiving\u201d or \u201cfalling into temptation\u201d \u2013 fulfilling ones desire possibly\naccompanied by not knowing how to escape such circumstances.\nFrom whichever perspective, it is a common recognition that knowing a course of\naction is wrong is actually of little value if the individual simply ignores it or \u2018cannot\nhelp themselves\u2019. It is the middle ground between awareness and action that becomes\nhard to define. That motivation or contemplation which determines which side of the\nforked path to take is likely determined by the individual\u2019s view of the difference\nbetween right and wrong and the choice between self and others. These \u2018defining\nmoments\u2019 (Badaracco, 1997) question whether the motivation for rising to temptation\nor not stems from self, others or indeed company pressures. Inner conflict makes\ninner restraint indispensable (Lama, 1999) and in addition to simply resisting wrong,\nthe path of virtuous motivation involves cultivating a default to what is right.\nHowever, the rationalist base of decide \u2018where you stand\u2019 inherent in the statements\njust made, has been challenged.\n6One view of the source of motivation is that of free will, namely the existence of a\n\u2018free will\u2019 of the rational conscious mind, \u2018the self\u2019, or \u2018the soul\u2019, in choosing ones\naction (Aristotle, 1911).\nA second view oscillates between the two polar extremes of determinism and\nevolution or more popularly nature vs. nurture (Kant 1785\/1910). This active debate\nrules out free choice, as the individual is considered to be either predetermined as\nnature has it that their character is largely formed or, alternatively, their nurture to\ndate influences their sense of moral and ethical worth.\nA third perspective in the determination of moral motivation focuses on what the\nleader ought to do (i.e. moralist perspective) or the consequences of action on ones\nforbidden desires (i.e. consequential perspective) (Bentham et al., 1996).\nThese three findings are briefly discussed below.\nFree Will\nThus the concept of free will, in turn leading to self directed concrete action, whether\nfitting or unfitting has been influenced by three ethical philosophical positions,\nnamely those of Aristotle (1911), Kant (1785\/1910) and the Benthamite Utilitarians\n(Bentham et al., 1996).\nAristotle (1911) positioned free will as the reason for action stimulated by desire\n(natural impulse) or guided and controlled by \u2018rational\u2019 understanding. Aristotle\n7(1911) linked free will to both rational and irrational choice. Where free will weakens\nis when a person does what is wrong, whilst knowing what is right and yet follows\nhis\/her desire against that reason anyway.\nAlthough supportive of the rationalist perspective behind the exercise of free will,\nKant (1785\/1910) differed from Aristotle (1911) in that he positioned moral action as\na result of autonomous choice and in so doing differentiated action driven by\nautonomous choice from merely an emotional response. Therefore, a necessary\ncondition for the exercise of free will as a basis for moral action is that action must be\nconsistent with reason. The role of reason then, namely the rational human mind, is to\ncontrol passion so that an individual can make \u2018right\u2019 choices and as such acts as a\nregulator of temptation.\nIn contrast, the Utilitarians evaluate the moral fit of the individual within the context\nof a complex system of relationships. Bentham et al. (1996) held that \u201cnature has\nplaced mankind under the governance of two sovereigns, pain and pleasure\u201d, that\ndetermine what the individual ought to do as well as what they actually do. This\nphilosophy centres around consequences, namely evaluating the pleasure and gain to\nbe realised against any foreseeable forfeits.\nNature vs. Nurture\nThe counter argument to that of free will is that of nature vs. nurture. The critical\nproposition is that actions result from a dynamic and complex interplay between\ngenetics and the social stimuli to which one has been subjected (Ayer, 1976). How a\nperson thinks and feels starts with their natural genetic make-up and is supplemented\n8by nature in terms of the social and learning environment the individual has been\nexposed to.\nThe \u2018can\u2019t help it \u2013 that\u2019s the way I am\u2019, message of the geneticists, in terms of moral\nevaluation and action, is supported by the psychologist personality profilers.\nPsychologists (Jung, 1948\/1959; Lazarus, 1963) postulated that human personality\ndiffers in the manner information is acquired and interpreted. Goleman (1996)\nsuggests that in addition to rational decision-making processes individuals use\nemotional process, termed \u2018emotional intelligence\u2019 to guide how to manage and\ninterrelate with others. An individual\u2019s latitude to exercise free will is, to some\nextent, circumscribed by both nature and nurture.\nIntents and consequences\nCountering the nature vs. nurture perspective, whilst bordering on the domain of free\nwill, is the rationalist link between act and consequence captured in the question of\nwhat one ought to do, contemplated since Socrates. Machiavelli (1958) drew\nattention to the ethical dimension of power use and in so doing positioned ethics as a\ncentral theme in organisational theory. The argument pursued is that the ethical\nculture in the organisation derives first and foremost from the leader\u2019s behaviour, as\nthe leader\u2019s direct actions or transactions and whether they follow the rules will make\nthe difference between ethical behaviour or not. Thus, what a leader does, the act,\ninduces a consequence, the nurture of an ethical\/unethical culture of enterprise.\nRegardless of the \u2018typology\u2019 of leader, the leader\u2019s manipulation of and influence over\ntheir followers and the subsequent successful motivation of them can create an\n9environment for temptations to enter and ethical dilemmas to increase.\nTransformational leaders rely more on charismatic attributes (Bennis and Nanus,\n1985; Avolio et al., 1991) (i.e. personal power) and their ability to project enthusiasm\nto influence and motivate followers. Servant leaders, on the other hand, influence\nfollowers through their own sense of service itself. Yet which ever philosophy is\nadopted, if the leader\u2019s motives or ethical standards are poor, or they are subjected to\nan environment of increased temptation they can nurture a \u201cdark side to leadership\u201d\n(Conger, 1990) whereby the leader is driven to accomplish their visions as much\nthrough misrepresentation and manipulation.\nThe Study\nAt a time of business scandals and fallen business heroes, our aim in this paper is to\nunderstand what kind of desires pose temptation to contemporary leaders. Our\ninterest is to examine temptation, particularly amongst leaders who act as distinct role\nmodels and ultimately set an example for others to follow. In effect, our analysis\nfocuses on the role of the Chief Executive. We adopt the Aristotelian (1911: box\nXIII, 1086 a 25 ff) position of \u201cuniversals do not exist independent of particulars, but\nin particulars as features of them\u201d. Hence, we do not assume a universal code of\nmoral behaviour for CEOs but more we attempt to capture the experiences of\nparticular CEOs in order to appreciate the nature of their code(s) of moral behaviour\nand further examine whether certain common themes emerge. Thus we make a\nHegelian (1931) distinction between \u2018understanding\u2019 of CEOs\u2019 temptations and the\n\u2018reasons\u2019 for CEOs\u2019 (in) action in response to their temptations and highlight such\ndistinction through dialectical reasoning. The narrative approach was chosen to\ncapture the humanness of the subjects as well as illustrate their particular decisions\n10\nand dilemmas. This in itself would highlight the many levels and facets of temptation\nand any influence of emotions and environment in the arising conflicts.\nTo select the sample of participant CEO leaders, critical business journals were\nexamined over several years to emerge with a list of 17 CEO Leaders that had been\nembodied by the press as displaying ethical principles, fortitude, prudence and\nfairness. Recognising the need for regular observation of behaviour, seven of these 17\ncandidates were selected on the basis of access through long term consultancy or\ndirect and personal contact by the authors. As well as allowing their stories to be told,\nthe seven CEO\u2019s also gave permission to interview one significant supporting person\nin their life such as colleagues, direct subordinates and business or personal partners\nto provide further supportive evidence. The study, conducted in 2003-2004, consisted\nof 34 interviews with 27 significant others additional to the seven which were with the\nCEOs in question.\nActing as consultants to the top-team or board, the authors were able to observe the\nbehaviour of, and interaction between, the CEO and the designated supporting\npersons. Field notes, recordings in a journal of observation, personal interpretations\nand inferences were collated for the duration of the study. Further, empirical material\nwas gathered through repeated discussion and narrative interview with each CEO and\nsupporting person (i.e. board and top team members, friends and relatives) with a\n\u201cbig-ear listening\u201d approach (Glaser, 2001) allowing each respondent to freely tell\ntheir story in the form of narrative account and an interpretive approach focused at the\nsubjective level of individual experience (Denzin and Lincoln, 2000).\n11\nBeing an explorative study, qualitative methods for data analysis and categorisation\nwere employed (Sutton and Callahan, 1987). The findings reported in this paper are\ndrawn from hand-coded data, based on the expressed desires and values which the\nparticipants highlighted as giving rise to temptation. The names of each of the study\nparticipants, whether CEO or relevant other, and their organisations have been kept\nconfidential, referring to them only through pseudonyms. Any other details possibly\nidentifying these individuals have been altered so as to preserve their anonymity.\nFindings\nThree overarching categories emerged from the data analysis, hedonism, power and\nposterity.\nHedonism was identified by the study participants as the pursuit of personal pleasure\nand self-satisfaction through the accumulation of material goods and consumerism\nand, or sensual pleasures. Power was referred to as the CEOs influence and control\nover his\/her environment. Posterity was considered as the CEO\u2019s drive to establish a\nlegacy sustained beyond their tenure in the post.\nHedonism (Pleasure): Cyril\nCyril is a self starter with a reported great personal wealth. Energetic and youthful\n(Respondent 15), this 38 year-old CEO has a reputation for relentless effort. From a\nmodest background, but well educated, Cyril actively supports causes concerning\nequality, social justice and raising of the living standards of the underprivileged\n(Respondent 17). Cyril\u2019s company is viewed by shareholders and the media as ethical\nand one that cares for its employees and society, particularly through its investments\n12\ninto the community. Cyril\u2019s self confessed weakness is the attention of women.\nClearly focused and ambitious, Cyril admits to being vulnerable to scandals\nconcerning his private life.\n\u201cI often contemplate life, and have come to the conclusion that irrelevant of how hard I try to\nresist the trappings of success and consequent wealth, it is impossible to escape it completely.\nI try to be moderate and to balance out all my actions in whatever I do. I come from a one\nchild family and parents who were middle-class wage earners and who have given me a good\neducation and sense of moral values. They are not religious people, so these values are not\nreligious-based, but rather the guiding principles of moderation and temperance, which\nhelped balance my life. I admit that by any measure, I can be seen as successful and rich, yet\nwhen I look at my private life, I see it as less than satisfactory. \u2026. I already have been\nthrough two marriages, with children in each. I am now living with my girlfriend or at least\nwhenever I am at home and not on a business trip. \u2026 I am not and never have been into\nnumbers and quantity of relationships, although I never had a problem in that department. \u2026\nWhat I really desire is quality of relationship and that is difficult to find. A beautiful woman\nis one temptation I find difficult to resist. Perhaps it comes as a trapping of a success?\u201d\nRespondent 2: Cyril\nCyril continued by relating personal temptations with the relentless drive to meet and\nface challenge.\n\u201cI wonder, if I could not afford such personal indulgence whether I would still be tempted?\nPerhaps, I just cannot resist the temptation of challenge, any challenge? My next challenge\nis to make this company even more successful \u2026 but that does not explain why I would\njeopardise any growth ambitions with personal scandals which are more likely to be reported\nshould my company become more successful\u201d\n13\nRespondent 2: Cyril\nHis female partner of that time concurs with Cyril\u2019s stated attraction to women but\nalso highlights other deeply noted sentiments.\n\u201cI think that I am Cyril\u2019s Barbie doll. He likes to dress me and undress me. He likes me in\nthe sensual and feminine clothes that are elegant. He likes to indulge me. I am his pleasure\nand entertainment. I too like nice clothes, but I prefer sporty and casual outfits that are\ntrendy but have a creative design. I also like contemporary, minimalist, interior design. Our\nplace in the city is decorated in such a style. Cyril is traditionalist. He prefers classical\ncountry style and his house in the country is typical of the region and very traditionally\ndecorated. He is also very, very patriotic \u2013 an idealist. We could chose to live practically\nanywhere we like, but he would not even entertain, let alone contemplate such an idea. I, on\nthe other hand, have no such attachments and could live in many different places even if they\nare isolated and far away.\u201d\nRespondent 19: Cyril\u2019s female partner\nCertainly, Cyril\u2019s mother is particularly conscious of how his emotions override\ncritical rationality.\n\u201c\u2026 if he would only choose the right woman \u2026 he would-be free to concentrate on business.\nHe would be freed from all the personal dramas, wasted energies his life seems to\nencounter.\u201d\nRespondent 31: Cyril\u2019s mother\nTemptations posed by pleasure, whether physical or sensual, have been persistently\ndocumented throughout history. Examples such as King Charles II, Bill Clinton and a\nlist of business leaders who are now fallen heroes have displayed desires that subvert\n14\ntheir well-being and other values. Such desires, similar to Cyril, are not easily\narticulated but are well recognised. Despite Cyril\u2019s self reflectivity and awareness,\nhis seeming inability to alter his pattern of attractions, irrespective of consequences,\nadds to the Aristotelian view of emotion being as much a determinant of free will as\nthat of rational discourse within a situation of plentiful resource.\n\u201cHe knows this girl is irrelevant to him, but nevertheless he persists in such a way that could\nattract unrequired press coverage. He could have anyone he wants and in a more discrete\nway. Why he doesn\u2019t? \u2013 well that\u2019s Cyril!\u201d\nRespondent 12: Cyril\u2019s Senior Manager\nPower: Oleg\nWealthy Russian, Oleg is Chairman and CEO of a newly founded company. He is\nperceived positively by western and Russia media for introducing Anglo American\nstyle corporate governance to Russian enterprise. His rise to prominence came when\nin 1995, the Yeltsin Government privatised state industries and Oleg, with his\nassociates, as did other \u201cRussian oligarchs\u201d, acquired massive shares in enterprises for\nbargain prices. Oleg and his associates adopted a diversified business model and in so\ndoing rapidly grew the company.\nSince then, Moscow had more billionaires than any other single city in the world\n(Forbes, 2004). In addition to building an enterprise of international repute, Oleg,\nthrough a variety of means, exercised considerable political influence.\n\u201cAlthough I am not in the same business, I have known Oleg since the 1995 privatisation\nthrough various business forums and social events. We have a very good relationship. He is\n15\nsmart, funny and great company. He became very successful and increasingly powerful in a\nvery short time. Then he began to change. He become blinded by his own success and\nobsessed with power. He wanted it all, the ultimate pinnacle of power \u2013 political power. He\nbelieved in his own invincibility and began openly to talking about it. I recall very clearly his\n40th birthday. I stopped by his office to congratulate him and convey my best wishes. At his\noffice, there where approximately 200 business people who come to do the same. It is a\nrelatively small community of Russians entrepreneurs and we all know each other. In a room\nfull of these people, Oleg began to openly talk about regime change, the strategies he would\npursue and the changes he would make. Many people, including myself did not know what to\nsay and how to handle his speech. But despite that, in a way, I still like him. He is fun to be\nwith.\u201d\nRespondent 11: Dimitry, Oleg\u2019s Friend\nAccording to Oleg\u2019s associates, his desire for political power grew out from his\npersonal wealth and not from a long standing commitment to state reform that would\nhave been evident from a grass roots investment in political infrastructure.\n\u201cI think that the power motive with Oleg was always self-evident. Anyone, who has highly\npowerful international directors (some say western allies) on the board of a \u201cphilanthropic\u201d\norganisation, has power in mind rather than philanthropy. However the question is how\nmuch Oleg\u2019s power aspiration was fuelled by our own culture that searches for strong\nleaders and how much by his western allies that desired to see Russia in the western image?\u201d\nRespondent 29: Ivan, Oleg\u2019s Senior Advisor\n\u201cI met Oleg for the fist time in mid-1990\u2019s when he came to our bank to do business. He was\na very ambitious and very smart young trader but rather inexperienced in large deals.\nHowever, he had an incredible network behind him and an almost \u2018psychopathic\u2019 drive to\nsucceed. I saw Oleg becoming fast a western style Russian tycoon and none questioned\nwhether the Russian political system was able to cope or not with Oleg\u2019s philanthropic\n16\ndonations to political parties, in a manner that governments with philanthropic cultures, such\nas American and UK can. \u2026 Oleg had a vision for a new Russian era and I think he is still\nworking on it. He is now more mature, less flamboyant, understands the perils of power, and\nnow waits his turn. I knew Oleg sufficiently to appreciate his thirst for power. Although\nimpatient he will now have to wait for a right time and than he will comeback more powerful\nand with a renewed zeal!\u201d\nRespondent 22: Mark, Merchant Banker and Oleg\u2019s Associate\nFrom our sample, self-confidence and a strong conviction of the moral righteousness\nof the leader\u2019s personal vision was clearly evident. How that vision was then\ncommunicated highlighted a compelling urge and a positive self-regard. The CEOs in\nthe sample were universally described by the significant others as individuals who\npossess special qualities, including a personal magnetism or charm that arouses\ndevotion and enthusiasm from those around them.\nWhether Oleg\u2019s \u201cassured sense of self-power\u201d (Maslow, 1973) encompassing self-\nrespect, pride, sureness, masterfulness, self-esteem and an ability to get ones own way\n(Ng, 1980; Bass, 1981; Metzger, 1987) is over-inflated or not is open to debate.\nHowever, what is clear is that Oleg\u2019s self assurance and a belief in his own vision\nsparkles in others commitment to follow. With little challenge from his coterie; with\ncontinuous reinforcement from followers and peer group members concerning the\nunassailability of his vision and rich track record of successful investment and\nindustrial growth, little wonder that Oleg became so self-absorbed.\nPosterity: John\n17\nJohn grew-up in a traditional, Celtic-catholic family that despite being \u2018financially\nchallenged\u2019 still promoted a strong sense of family bonding. Being the oldest of four\nchildren, John, from an early age, displayed the determination to succeed and not to\nend up working hard with modest return like his father. Small in stature and often a\ntarget for other kids to bully, he learned to fend for himself thus developing an overt\nbelief in his own capability, whilst simultaneously lacking trust and confidence in\nother people. Only once others had proven their loyalty did John offer them more\nattention.\nMarried with three children, John\u2019s attachment to family values was evident as he ran\nthe organisation in a distinctly idiosyncratic manner fostering a close team culture and\nsecurity of employment for those who demonstrated their commitment and loyalty.\nPersonable, passionate, energetic and armed with an intimate knowledge of detail,\nJohn worked hard in micromanaging the enterprise, paying little reverence to \u2018vision\u2019\nand \u2018formal policies\u2019, viewing the former as \u2018touchy feely nonsense\u2019 and the latter as\n\u2018bureaucratic red tape\u2019 that reduces flexibility and freedom to do business. His\npaternalistic care for people earned him considerable popularity as he projected to\nothers a sense of them being special, which, in turn, fed his own desire to increase his\nown visibility, demonstrate his leadership talents and thus receive applause as a\nmindful steward of people and the organisation. His personable style was also\nrecognised by the media and press where he effectively represented the organisation\non the public stage.\n\u201cI made a life-style switch when I left the multi-national organisation which was paying me a\nlot of money which did not have the right values and adopted questionable business\n18\npractices. I moved to a new industry sector and assumed the position of CEO in an\norganisation that promoted my sort of values. I worked very hard in building the place up\nand never regretted making the switch. That is not to say that everything was perfect and\nthat I had an easy time. Not at all, there were difficulties, and organisational baggage, but it\nwas my kind of place. I created a special kind of business that was full of vibrancy and\ncompetitive zeal. However, like so many good things they come to an end\u201d\nRespondent 3: John, ex-CEO\nDiscussions with others in the organisation confirmed that John was recognised as\nhaving \u2018pulled the place around\u2019. His repositioning of the organisation in terms of\nprofitability and international reputation was acknowledged internally and externally.\n\u201cMany thought that I overstayed and that no CEO should stay that long in one place. When\nthe time came to retire, I worried that a new person will take different course of action and\nwill destroy all my hard work. I had a fear that my deputy, a real visionary and a world class\nplayer would get the job and take organisation in a different direction. His vision was\ndifferent to what I had carved for the organisation. I wanted a legacy so that people\nremembered me. \u2026. The bottom-line is that I resorted to Byzantine nature tactics in search\nfor my successor corrupting the very process I created. On the surface it all looked\nprofessional, the reputable head hunter agency, the nomination committee, the selection\ncommittee and the rest. But in the background, I controlled it all, I told the head hunter who\nnot to put forward. When that become questioned I backtracked. I evoked the two \"green\ndevils\", jealousy and envy by hand picking the selection committee members. Rumours\nspread amongst the selection committee of the supposed incompetence of the internal\ncandidates. So obsessed was I that I lost the focus on who would get the job. External\ncandidates heard that the highly able internals withdrew from the race which allowed me to\npersuade one of the external candidates who had no vision to come back into the race \u2026 I\ndeeply regret it now. Every time I read in the press that the place is going down, I feel ill. I\nknow I am not welcomed there anymore and that hurts.\u201d\n19\nRespondent 3: John, ex-CEO\nJohn\u2019s version of events was confirmed by one of the internal candidates.\n\u201cIf, I am honest with myself, I have to say yes, I knew that John was behind the selection\nprocess charade. However, I did not want to accept it. I liked the guy. We worked well\ntogether. He had done a lot for this organisation and I couldn\u2019t believe that he would do\nanything to damage it. I trusted him. What I did not suspect was that John was obsessed\nwith his posterity. He is egocentric and he likes the limelight and being liked. Only, recently\nwhen we met by accident at a New York social event, the penny dropped. He told me how\nmuch damage done had been inflicted on his posterity by his successor and how leaving a\npositive legacy was important to him. \u2026 I believe he genuinely regrets it all but looking\nback, I can now clearly see all the things that John had to do to prevent me getting the job.\u201d\nRespondent 6: Victor, John\u2019s ex-Deputy\n\u201cIn 25 years of executive search, I have never been so embarrassed and frustrated with the\nprocess of finding a replacement for John. He intervened in the process so much so that I\nwas on the verge of blowing the whistle. \u2026. The search process was so damaged by one\nnarcissist obsessed with the preservation of his legacy. I am still embarrassed through being\na part of it.\u201d\nRespondent 33: Kate, Executive Recruiter\nThose CEO\u2019s in the study who admitted to being tempted by posterity also exhibited\nnarcissistic tendencies as cited by Kets de Vries and Miller (1985), such as, thriving\non power, being charismatic, enjoying manipulation through building strong\nconnections with followers who displayed dependency needs. Similar to John, the\nother study participants admitted to relinquishing their posts with difficulty, poorly\nmanaging or ignoring succession planning with personally groomed internal\n20\nreplacement candidates. In many ways such characteristics are not unusual as history\nhas thrown up many examples of men obsessed with their posterity. Kakabadse and\nKakabadse (1999) have suggested that healthy narcissism plays a part in achieving\nleadership status. This element of character assists leaders to powerfully impress\nothers and encourage followers to follow. However, Kakabadse and Kakabadse\n(1999) warn that there is a fine line between self-confidence and self-love.\nDiscussion\nEach human example above not only represents their particular temptation for the\nleaders but also opens up question to the many different levels at which such\ntemptation is likely to exist, not to mention how each of the three specified\ntemptations could interlink. Where, for instance, does Oleg\u2019s power stop and John\u2019s\nposterity begin? It could be argued that Oleg\u2019s power is posterity driven. Making\nthat political impact would be power turned into a legacy. There is a difference\nbetween the two characters in that one is perhaps more contained to organisational\nparameters than the other, but there is the similarity that both enter realms of the\nunreal.\nEqually in terms of which comes first \u2013 the position or the temptation - Cyril may\nwell have been as hedonistic in any position he occupied. Alternatively, his attraction\nmay have increased with the perceived power of the position bringing more\nopportunities to indulge. This could also be seen as power led temptation rather than\npure hedonism.\n21\nFrom Cyril\u2019s \u2018can\u2019t help himself\u2019 fun to Oleg\u2019s disillusioned need to change the world\nto John\u2019s paranoid control of the legacy he feels he must leave behind, there is seen a\nrange of temptation. That range of temptation pulls on the inner self and creates a\nstruggle between the individual and society \u2013 setting into contest ego and objects\n(Freud, 1962 in Singer 1994).\nFurther, it is evident that the degree of individual struggle and actual level of take up\nof temptation depends on many factors and variables. In fact, this has been shown to\nbe the case as studies of senior executives suggest that they substantially vary in terms\nof their experiences, capabilities, values, and personalities which in turn provides\nsubstantial differences of interpretation of strategic challenges, personal aspirations,\nbeliefs about what is right, sense of urgency, behavioural patterns as well as\nsuccumbing to temptation (Finkelstein, 1992; Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996;\nKakabadse and Kakabadse, 1999). Yet, one common theme to emerge from the study\nreported in this paper was that of obligation to shareholders, the corporation and its\ncontinued sustainability. Despite such sense of duty, pursuits and actions, recognised\nat the time as morally impairing the organisation and individual in question, were still\nundertaken. Whether as a result of the emotive side to Aristotelian free will, Kantian\nrationality or Benthamite Utilitarianism, the only common theme to emerge is that\nhighlighted by Hegel (1931) who concludes that human beings contain contradictions.\nCertainly the study participants reported a complex interplay between six complex\nvariables which ultimately led them to succumb (or not) to one of the three\ntemptations discussed in this paper. These six variables are:\n1 Cognitive style (Hambrick, 1981):\n\uf0b7 The nature of each individual\u2019s thinking based on their own perception.\n22\n\uf0b7 Processes, influenced by personality characteristics (predispositions,\njudgements and attributions) and memories, past experiences, dreams\nand fantasies; values and prejudices).\n2 Sensations: such as seeing, hearing, touching, tastes and smells.\n3 Deep seated feelings (Kets de Vries, 2001): which hold pleasant connotations\nas contentment, zest, lust, confidence, respect, reverence, affection, love,\nempathy, compassion and unpleasant designs as indifference, scorn, despair,\nirritation, anger, jealousy, fear, disgust, shame, remorse, guilt and anxiety.\n4 Interpersonal state: energy level and health condition beyond the control of\nthe individual but which affect their decision-making processes.\n5 Group relations: participation patterns, sense of belonging and needing\nacclaim.\n6 Social context: societal structure and norms.\nConclusion\nFree will, in the form of self determination, emerged as only one influence on the\nleader\u2019s ability to recognise, resist or give way to temptation. The influence of\ncontext, held cultural beliefs, organisational experiences and personal understandings\nof the leadership role, were equally powerful reported determinants of CEO action.\nWith no common theme to tackle as a cause for rising to temptation, whether,\nhedonism, power and posterity, the only reliable control or prevention must come\nback to an infrastructure that facilitates the leader to resist temptation. Whatever\nsupport and counsel is made available to the leader, there is still one final solution that\ndoes not lie within the leader themself but in an outside influence or control. It is\nconcluded that there is a \u2018law of probability\u2019 that rising to temptation will happen and\n23\nhappen in different ways and controls from within each individual vary too greatly to\nisolate a \u2018safety stop\u2019 behaviour. Whether temptation is viewed as an internal or\nexternal influence on the leader, it is postulated that the control to reduce or prevent it\nmust come from the external environment in the form of rules, organisational\nmechanisms, transparency due to the inability to predict the effectives of self\ndetermined constraints on action.\nAn example in ancient time is provided by Homer\u2019s (1997) epic, The Odyssey, when\non his homeward voyage the main protagonist, Odysseus is tempted by irresistible\nmusic made by nymphs. Being advised by Circe to stop the ears of his seamen with\nwax, so that they should not hear the ravishing and attractive music nor strain of his\nplea, Odysseus had himself bound to the mast until they pass the Sirens\u2019 island and\nceased to be heard. By creating this infrastructure Odysseus was able to resist the\nnymphs\u2019 charming song that impels mariners to cast themselves into the sea to\ndestruction and through not so doing rightly stay on their course.\nMore recently, such governance is replicated in the \u201cshared leadership\u201d model\n(Kakabadse and Kakabadse, 2005). This provides a sound infrastructure where power\nis shared and not invested in one individual. It will not eliminate leadership\ntemptation but rather mediate against any abuse of leadership position.\nBearing in mind the introduction of governance safeguards against personal excess\nand desire, still some of the control must come from within the leaders themselves.\nLearning how to question self and analyse actions is the start to reviewing self\nmotivation and the impact that has on followers. Leaders need to understand their\n24\nown will and how they perceive the outside world as according to Socrates (Plato,\n1981) an unexamined life is not worth living. It is concluded that the combination of\norganisational audit and the capability development of reflexivity over self will\nprovide for the ethical and reputational safeguard of the enterprise.\nReferences\nAristotle (1911), The Nicomachean Ethics, (Dutton, and Chase, Ed and Trans),\nOxford University Press, London.\nAvolio, B.J., Waldman, D.A. and Yammarino, F.J.
