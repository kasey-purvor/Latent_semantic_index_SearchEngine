Here, we compare the behavioral, endocrine and27\nneuroendocrine responses of individual sticklebacks exposed to either an unfamiliar conspecific28\nor to a predator. We found that the two stressors elicited a similar hypothalamic-pituitary-29\ninterrenal response as assessed by whole-body concentrations of immunoreactive corticosteroids,30\nbut produced quite different patterns of change in brain monoamine and monoamine metabolite31\ncontent as assessed by concentrations of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE)32\nand the monoamine metabolites 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid33\n(HVA) and 3-4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). For example, relative to baseline levels,34\nNE levels were elevated in individuals exposed to a predator but were lower in individuals35\nconfronted by a challenging conspecific. Levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in specific36\nregions of the brain showed extremely close links with behavioral characteristics. Frequency of37\nattacking a conspecific and inspecting a predator were both positively correlated with38\nconcentrations of NE. However, whereas serotonin was negatively correlated with frequency of39\nattacking a conspecific, it was positively associated with predator inspection. The data indicate40\nthat the qualitative and quantitative nature of the neuroendocrine stress response of sticklebacks41\nvaries according to the nature of the stressor, and that interindividual variation in behavioural42\nresponses to challenge are reflected by neuroendocrine differences.43\nKey words: stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, behavioral syndromes, antipredator44\nbehavior, aggression, glucocorticoid, serotonin, stress, coping styles, individual differences45\nRunning head: Individual differences in sticklebacks46\n3INTRODUCTION47\n48\nBoth attacking a conspecific and confronting a potential predator are dangerous. In49\naddition to energetic costs [1], aggression can result in injury [2] and exposure to predation risk50\nwhile fighting [3]. Similarly, an encounter with a potential predator can impose energetic costs of51\nescape [4], injury [5] or even death. Not surprisingly, both confrontation by a challenging52\nconspecific  [6-11] and exposure to a predator [12-15] elicit a neuroendocrine stress response.53\nThe neuroendocrine stress response involves a coordinated activation of both the54\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (or interrenal, in the case of fishes, HPI) axis and the brain55\nmonoamine neurotransmitter systems [16]. When a stimulus evokes a stress response, both56\nsystems are activated by the same central mechanism, resulting in the elevation of plasma57\ncorticosteroids and brain monoaminergic activity. In general, exposure to stressors is associated58\nwith increased concentrations of plasma glucocorticoids and increased turnover of 5-HT to 5-59\nhydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) [17].60\nIndividual differences in behavior are often related to individual differences along both61\naxes of the stress response [18-22]. With respect to the HPA axis, individual differences in62\naggressiveness are negatively correlated with concentrations of plasma glucocorticoids in trout63\n[23] and chickens [24]. In humans, individual differences in behaviors that are analogous to risk-64\ntaking behaviors and aggression are associated with increased norepinephrine and dopamine65\nactivity [25,26].  Finally, aggression and risk-taking behaviors in several species have been66\nlinked to serotonin turnover. For example, individual differences in aggression are negatively67\nrelated to serotonin turnover in monkeys [24,27-29], trout [21] and anolis lizards [30-32].68\nHowever, the relationship between 5-HT, stress, the HPI axis and aggression is complex and69\n4depends on the duration of the stressor. For example, in salmonids, 5-HT turnover is usually70\npositively associated with plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations and negatively associated71\nwith aggression. However, long-term stimulation of the serotonergic system has inhibitory72\n(negative) effects on the HPI axis [33] and aggression [17].73\nIn previous work, we have shown that behavioral reactions to predators and competing74\nconspecifics covary at the individual level in threespined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus)75\n[34-36]. While some individuals are willing to engage in behavior that appears to be dangerous,76\nsuch as foraging under predation risk or performing predator inspection, other individuals are77\nmuch more cautious around predators. Individuals that take more risks in this context are also78\nmore aggressive toward conspecifics. Covariance among suites of behavioral traits is common79\n[37,38] and in several species the shy-bold continuum and the proactive-reactive axis have been80\nassociated with individual differences in stress responsiveness [39]. Therefore it is possible that81\ndifferences in how individual sticklebacks respond to dangerous situations might be linked with82\ndifferences in the stress response.83\nHere, we investigated natural variation in behavioral, glucocorticoid and monoamine84\nresponses of individual sticklebacks to two potentially dangerous situations. We wished to85\nestablish whether wild-caught animals responding to ecologically-relevant challenges show86\nstress responses that are comparable in nature and extent to those described for laboratory87\nanimals, and whether the stress response might be an underlying root of the covariance of88\nbehavioral responses in sticklebacks. With this in mind, we exposed individuals to either an89\nunfamiliar conspecific or to a potential predator and recorded their behavior. Although the90\ndanger of predation is greater than the danger posed by a territorial intrusion, we hypothesized91\nthat both situations would induce a stress response because social stress is one of the most92\n5effective stressors in inducing a high magnitude response in other animals [40]. We sampled93\nindividuals at 15, 30 or 60 minutes after exposure to determine the time course of the94\nglucocorticoid and monoaminergic responses to these two threats. This design allowed us not95\nonly to follow the neuroendocrine responses to these stressors through time, but also to96\ndetermine whether individual differences in behavioral responses to these challenges could be97\nrelated to underlying neuroendocrine physiology.98\n99\nMETHODS100\n101\nOverview: Individuals were presented with one of two potential threats, either an102\nunfamiliar conspecific or a predator, hereafter referred to as \u2018conspecific\u2019 and \u2018predator\u2019,103\nrespectively, and their behavior was recorded. Individuals exposed to the \u2018conspecific\u2019 or the104\n\u2018predator\u2019 were subdivided into three different treatment groups, sacrificed 15, 30 or 60 minutes105\nafter exposure to the potentially threatening stimulus. Individuals were randomly assigned to a106\ntreatment group prior to observing their behavior. The responses to the stressors were compared107\nacross time periods and against a \u2018baseline control\u2019 group, which consisted of individuals108\nsampled directly from an undisturbed stock tank. Each treatment group comprised ten109\nindividuals.110\nSubadult sticklebacks were collected from the River Endrick in January 2004 and brought111\nto the Glasgow University Field Station, Rowardennan, where all of the behavioral observations112\nwere carried out. Groups of fish (n=10-40) were maintained in flow-through stock tanks (210113\nliters) at 9 \u00b1 2\u00b0 C and on a 14L:10D photoperiod. Fish were fed frozen bloodworms ad libitum114\ndaily except on the day of observation, when they were unfed.115\n6Behavioral observations took place in March and April 2004 in a U-shaped flume with a116\nlive pike (Esox lucius) in either arm of the flume. Aquaria that were used for behavioral117\nobservation (\u2018observation tanks\u2019, 44 liters, 61x32x22 cm) were placed inside the flume and next118\nto a window in the flume so that the behavior of the fish could be observed. The window was119\ncovered by a blind with a small opening which allowed the observer to see through the window120\nwith minimal disturbance to the fish. Each observation tank contained a one-liter glass conical121\nflask, a plastic plant and a length of opaque tube (12 cm diameter, 36 cm tall) that stood122\nvertically on one side of the tank and allowed fish to be introduced into the tank with a minimum123\nof disturbance. Exterior lines on the tanks divided them into 16 equally-sized areas.124\nEach arm of the flume contained one of two live pike (46, 41cm standard length) and125\ncloth plants which served as hiding places for the pike. The compartments were fitted with a126\nremovable opaque cover which created a dark, shaded area for the pike. The pike were caught by127\nhook and line in February 2004 in a small water body near the Glasgow University Field Station128\n(the Duibh Lochan). The two pike were fed dead minnows and dead sticklebacks ad libitum.129\n130\nProcedure:131\nFish were removed from the stock tank and placed into a settling tank (49 liters,132\n61x31x26 cm) for two nights in order to acclimate to the flume. After the acclimation period,133\nsticklebacks were netted from the settling tank and were randomly assigned to one of eight134\ntreatments (see below for a description of the different treatments). The stickleback was135\ndeposited into the tube in an observation tank. After 15 minutes, the tube was lifted, which136\nallowed the stickleback to swim freely around the tank. After another 15 minutes, the fish was137\n7presented with either an unfamiliar conspecific or a pike, and the behavioral observation began.138\nBehavioral observations of response to an unfamiliar conspecific and predator were alternated.139\n140\nTreatments:141\nUnfamiliar conspecific: We employed a procedure that was designed to simulate a142\nchallenge to the resident fish by an intruding conspecific. Sticklebacks at this size and age (0.373143\n\u00b1 0.02 g, approximately 7-8 months of age) are not breeding and so do not defend breeding144\nterritories, but they do display aggressive behavior during competition for food and other145\nresources and can be territorial [41]. Therefore we interpret the behavioural response of146\nsticklebacks to the unfamiliar conspecific in this experiment as a response to a potential147\ncompetitor for food and\/or space. It is also worth considering that the sticklebacks\u2019 response to a148\nconspecific might also reflect an affiliative motivation because they were held in isolation.149\nA live conspecific (within 5mm standard length of the resident) was placed into the flask150\nin the observation tank. Seven different conspecifics were used as intruders throughout the151\nexperiment. A fish was never used as an intruder more than once consecutively. The flask152\neffectively standardized the behavior of the intruder by minimizing movement. The frequency of153\nattacking the conspecific (biting) was recorded for 15 minutes after the resident first oriented to154\nthe conspecific because some individuals were facing away from the flask when the intruder was155\nintroduced. Latency to orient to the intruder ranged from 0.4-482.0 seconds (mean=104.6 \u00b1 24.7156\ns). This procedure is roughly analogous to studies with trout where a resident is challenged by an157\nintruder [23]. However, an important difference is that in the present case there is no physical158\ncontact between the resident and intruder and the intruder cannot escape. We elected to use this159\nprocedure to minimize stress to the intruder. After the behavioral observation, the flask160\n8containing the conspecific was removed from the tank and the resident fish was sacrificed161\naccording to treatment (15 minutes, 30 minutes or 60 minutes after the behavioral observation162\nwas completed).163\nPredator: This procedure was designed to simulate a potential predatory threat by a live164\npike. We lured the pike into a chamber situated next to the observation tank by removing cover165\nover the pike. In general, the pike willingly swam into the chamber, seeking cover. A removable166\nopaque divider was situated between the observation aquarium and the predator chamber. To167\nstart the behavioural observation, the divider separating the observation aquarium from the168\nchamber was gently lifted, allowing the stickleback a clear view of the pike on the other side of169\nthe glass. The behavior of the individual stickleback was observed for 15 minutes after the170\ndivider was removed and the following behaviors were recorded: predator inspection (swimming171\nnext to and orienting to the mouth of the pike) and time orienting (body facing toward the pike).172\nWhether the pike moved or oriented to the stickleback during the observation was also recorded.173\nAfter the behavioral observation, the opaque divider separating the chamber from the174\nobservation aquarium was replaced and the fish was sacrificed according to treatment (15175\nminutes, 30 minutes or 60 minutes after the behavioral observation completed). In order to176\neliminate any olfactory cues that might affect subsequent behavioral observations, the water in177\neach of the observation tanks was replaced after each behavioral observation.178\nThe two pike used in this study did not differ in behavior and movement of the pike179\nduring the observation period did not have a statistically detectable effect on either the behavior180\nor the physiology of the sticklebacks (all P>0.05).181\nBaseline control: Each day, for ten days, a single stickleback was netted from a stock182\ntank and sacrificed immediately to contribute to a baseline control value for neuroendocrine and183\n9hormonal measurements. These fish were collected at the same time as individuals in the184\ntreatment groups to minimize the amount of disturbance in the stock tank.185\nSettling tank control: At the end of each observation day, 1-2 remaining individuals in186\nthe \u2018settling tank\u2019 were quickly netted from the settling tank and sacrificed immediately. This187\ngroup (n=10) was analyzed for corticosteroids to determine whether transfer and housing in the188\nflume produced a stress response. However, it is important to note that this group does not189\ncontrol for the effect of isolation. We did not detect a difference in whole-body between the190\nsettling tank control and the baseline control and therefore did not analyze this treatment group191\nfurther (Figure 1, F1,18=0.488, P=0.494).192\n193\nTissue collection194\nFish were quickly killed by decapitation. The head and body were immediately weighed,195\nthe brain dissected out within three minutes and mounted in Tissue-Tek (Sakura). The brain and196\nbody were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at \u201380\u00b0 C until physiological analyses. A197\nsmall amount of tissue from the tail fin was placed in 80% ethanol for DNA extraction for sex198\ndetermination. Tissue was collected between 0800 and 1800 hours. As in [42], we found no199\nevidence for circadian changes in whole-body cortisol (r=0.045, F1,58=0.118, P=0.773).200\n201\nSteroid determination202\nCorticosteroids were assessed by measurement of solvent-extractable immunoreactivity in203\nwhole-body homogenates. Corticosteroids were extracted from the tissue by homogenization in204\nethyl acetate (5:1 volume:carcass weight). Recovery of steroids from homogenized tissue was205\nassessed by adding 50\u00b5l radio-labelled cortisol tracer to homogenized tissue and equilibrating for206\n10\none hour before extractions. Immunoreactive steroids were quantified in 20-100 \u00b5l aliquots of207\nethyl acetate extracts of whole-body homogenates using a validated cortisol radioimmunoassay208\nprocedure as described previously [43-46]. We used the rabbit polyclonal antibody to cortisol209\nproduced by the IgG Corporation and supplied by Campro Scientific (code IgG-F-2).210\nA standard curve of 0-800 pg cortisol per tube was used.211\nWe quantified cortisol in whole-body homogenates rather than plasma because successful212\nextraction of the brain for monoamine analyses required that it be dissected out and frozen as213\nsoon as possible, which precluded rapid blood sampling from the body. The whole-body214\nhomogenate method measures cortisol in multiple body compartments. Therefore in addition to215\nmeasuring plasma concentrations of cortisol, this method also detects cortisol derivatives in the216\nliver and gall bladder that might have cross-reacted with the antibody [47], This does not detract217\nfrom the ability of this method to detect the onset of a stress response, because corticosteroids218\nare synthesized de novo and not stored prior to release. This method has been employed219\npreviously to monitor the stress response in fish from which, because of their small size, blood220\nsamples could not be obtained, including juvenile trout [48], zebra fish [49] and sticklebacks221\n[46]. Simultaneous measurement of plasma cortisol and whole-body cortisol in fish exposed to222\nacute and chronic stressors has confirmed that the method is appropriate for detecting stress-223\ninduced changes in HPI activity [48]. Hereafter we refer to concentrations of corticosteroids we224\nmeasured on whole body preps as ng\/g of \u2018whole-body cortisol\u2019.225\n226\nAnalysis of brain monoamines227\nBrains were sectioned in a frozen state on a cryostat and mounted on glass slides.228\nSections of 300 \u00b5m thickness were cut in the coronal plane. Brain-punch microdissection was229\n11\nperformed as described by [30]. The hypothalamus, telencephalon and region posterior to the230\nhypothalamus (\u2018reticular formation\u2019) were identified for punching.231\nPunches from each of these three regions were collected and homogenized in 50\u00b5l ice-232\ncold 4% perchloric acid containing 40 ng\/ml DHBA (dihydroxybenzamine) as internal standard,233\nusing an MSE 100-W ultrasonic disintegrator. Samples were then centrifuged at 13000rpm for234\n10 minutes at 4\u00baC and the supernatants were analyzed for serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and235\nnorepinephrine (NE) and their metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 3,4-236\ndihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) using high performance237\nliquid chromatography with electrochemical detection [50] immediately, or stored at -80\u00baC for238\nno more than two days prior to analysis. Pellets were stored at -80\u00baC  for subsequent analysis of239\nprotein content in an Eppendorf Biophotometer by a pre-made program measuring absorbance at240\n280nm. The monoamines and monoamine metabolites were quantified using standard solutions241\nand corrected for recovery of the internal standard using HPLC software (CSW, DataApex Ltd.,242\nthe Czech republic). The concentration of monoamines and monoamine metabolites is expressed243\nas ng per mg protein.244\nWe did not detect strong differences between brain regions in concentrations of brain245\nmonoamines: the only effect that we detected was that levels of DA (F2,81=3.36, P=0.04), 5-246\nHIAA (F2,81=4.57, P=0.013) and 5-HT (F2,81=5.21, P=0.007) were significantly lower in the247\nreticular formation in the \u2018predator\u2019 treatment (Table 1). Therefore we summed the concentration248\nof each monoamine across regions and focused our subsequent analysis of treatment differences249\non the whole-brain values. However, the failure to detect strong region-specific differences250\nshould not be overinterpreted because we did not have the resolution to detect fine-scale251\n12\ndifferences. Other studies have found region-specific differences in monoamine turnover during252\naggression [32].253\nA decrease in the concentration of a monoamine neurotransmitter could reflect a254\nreduction in the release of the neurotransmitter (decrease in activity) or an increase in turnover to255\nits metabolite (increase in activity). Therefore, it is preferable to use the ratio of the parent256\nneurotransmitter to its metabolite (5-HIAA:5-HT, DOPAC:DA AND HVA:DA) as an index of257\nneurotransmitter activity. However, we were unable to quantify the NE metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-258\nhydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in any of the samples as a consequence of non-identified259\ninterfering peaks. In addition, in some samples the monoamines (especially 5-HIAA and 5-HT)260\nbecame degraded during the sampling procedure, resulting in our failure to detect 5-HIAA. This261\nwas particularly a problem for the \u2018conspecific\u2019 treatments (Table 1). Samples with undetectable262\nlevels of a monoamine were omitted from that analysis.263\nHere, we report data on the concentration of both the parent monoamine and metabolite,264\nand we focus our interpretation on differences between treatment groups, rather than on the265\nfunctional significance of absolute levels.266\n267\nDetermining genetic sex268\nDNA was extracted from each fin clip and genetic sex was determined by genotyping269\neach individual for a male-specific genetic marker validated for sticklebacks [51].270\n271\nData analysis272\nWe compared the behavioral and physiological responses of sticklebacks to an unfamiliar273\nconspecific and a predator across time using general linear models except when data were non-274\n13\nnormal. We tested for the effects of sex, body size, time and treatment on each of the dependent275\nvariables (behavior, whole-body cortisol and brain monoamines in the different regions). We did276\nnot detect sex differences in behavior, whole-body cortisol or brain monoamines and therefore277\ndid not analyze this factor further (all P>0.4). The least-squares difference post-hoc test was used278\nto test for differences between groups, except when the distribution was non-normal, in which279\ncase we tested for differences between treatments using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.280\nPearson correlations were used to test for statistically significant relationships between281\nvariables when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, Spearman rank correlation282\nstatistics were computed. Because the same behavioral data was used to test for associations with283\nbrain monoamine concentrations, we used the sequential Bonferroni procedure to correct for284\nmultiple tests. Briefly, for each brain region within a treatment group, we replaced the285\ncorrelation statistics with their corresponding P-values and then ranked them from smallest to286\nlargest. Results that were significant (P<0.05) after the sequential Bonferroni procedure are287\nreported [52]. All tests were two-tailed.288\nAll of the procedures were carried out according to institutional guidelines and in289\naccordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986.290\n291\nRESULTS292\nBehavioural and physiological responses to an unfamiliar conspecific293\nPresentation of an unfamiliar conspecific elicited a behavioral response; on average,294\nindividuals approached the intruder 8 times and attacked 11 times within the observation period.295\nHowever, individuals differed in their behavioral reaction to the simulated intrusion; while one296\nindividual attacked the conspecific over 40 times, other individuals spent most of their time297\n14\nhiding, and scarcely left the refuge. Body size explained some of this individual variation; bigger298\nfish were more aggressive toward their size-matched opponents (number of attacks: r=0.433,299\nP=0.024, n=27). All of the fish oriented to and approached the conspecific and one-half of the300\nfish attacked it at least once.301\nInteraction with the unfamiliar conspecific quickly produced a glucocorticoid response302\n(Figure 1). Whole-body cortisol levels were highest 15 minutes after the simulated intrusion and303\nthen returned to baseline levels by 30 minutes.304\nThe serotonergic system was quickly suppressed in response to the presence of the305\nunfamiliar conspecific, as indicated by reduced whole-brain levels of 5-HT (Figure 2A, Table 1).306\nDopamine turnover to DOPAC was elevated 60 minutes following the aggressive307\ninteraction (Figure 2C and 2D), while levels of norepinephrine were consistently low (Figure308\n2F).309\nIndividual differences in concentrations of brain monoamines were related to differences310\namong individuals in aggressiveness. Individuals with lower hypothalamic 5HT were more311\naggressive (r=-0.806, P=0.016, n=8, Figure 3A), while norepinephrine (r=0.883, P=0.020, n=6,312\nFigure 3B) and DOPAC (r=0.815, P=0.048, n=6, Figure 3C) were positively associated with313\naggressiveness.314\n315\nBehavioural and physiological responses to a predator316\nWhen presented with the pike, most individuals inspected the predator at least once and317\noriented to it more than nine times. As in the \u2018conspecific\u2019 treatment, individuals differed in their318\nbehavior: some individuals inspected the pike as many as seven times during the 15-minute319\nobservation period, while others spent the entire observation period hiding in the refuge.320\n15\nExposure to the predator elicited a significant glucocorticoid response within 15 minutes321\nwhich reached a maximum 60 minutes after exposure to the predator (Figure 1). Concentrations322\nof DOPAC fell at 60 minutes (Figure 2D) while concentrations of HVA increased at 15 minutes323\n(Figure 2E), indicating that predator-induced stress stimulated the rapid turnover of DA to HVA.324\nActivity under predation risk and predator inspection behavior (both of which potentially325\ninvolve a risk of predation) were positively associated with neurotransmitter concentrations. For326\nexample, individuals with greater levels of NE engaged in riskier behavior (r=0.766, P=0.027,327\nn=8, Figure 4A). Serotonin turnover was also associated with predator inspection behavior: the328\nnumber of predator inspections was significantly positively correlated with hypothalamic329\nserotonin (r=0.928, P=0.003, n=7, Figure 4B) and negatively correlated with whole-brain330\nserotonergic activity (r=-0.669, P=0.049, n=9, Figure 4C).331\n332\nComparing responses to the conspecific and predator333\nBoth confrontation by a conspecific and exposure to a predator elicited a cortisol334\nresponse, but the time course of the cortisol response differed between treatments (Figure 1), as335\nevidenced by the significant interaction between time and treatment (F2,58=5.5, P=0.006).336\nMoreover, the magnitude (average across the three time periods) of the cortisol response was337\ngreater to the predator compared to a conspecific (Conspecific: 47\u00b1-4.97 ng\/g, Predator: 72\u00b18.24338\nng\/g, P=0.002).339\nRelative to the conspecific treatment, NE (Figure 2F) and to a lesser extent, DA (Figure340\n2C) were higher in the predator treatments.341\n342\n16\nDISCUSSION343\n344\nIn this experiment, we tested the hypothesis that both the HPI axis and brain345\nmonoaminergic systems are activated in response to fighting with an unfamiliar conspecific and346\nexposure to a predator. While other studies have found links between these systems in laboratory347\nanimals, the results from this study extends these findings to wild-caught animals that were348\nconfronted by ecologically relevant challenges [28,53]. We found that both stressors elicited a349\nsimilar HPI response, but produced very different patterns of change in monoamine content.350\nOur design permitted us to determine the time course of the neuroendocrine response to351\nthese stressors and to ascertain whether individual differences in behavioral responses to the352\nstressors were related to underlying physiology. We showed that not only do these challenges353\nelicit a neuroendocrine response, but that different behavioral responses of individuals were354\nrelated to their particular neuroendocrine profiles.355\n356\nThe cortisol response to a conspecific and predator were broadly similar, but exposure to a357\npredator was more stressful358\n359\nDuring the present study, both confrontation with an unfamiliar conspecific and exposure360\nto a predator resulted in activation of the HPI axis and significant alterations in the levels of361\nbrain monoamines in sticklebacks. These results are consistent with other studies which have362\nshown that both confrontation by a challenging conspecific [10,23] and exposure to a predator363\n[54] elicit a neuroendocrine stress response in fishes.364\n17\nIn the present study both exposure to a conspecific or to a predator resulted in highly365\nsignificant increases in whole-body cortisol concentrations within 15 minutes relative to controls.366\nIn the conspecific-exposed group, whole-body cortisol levels were statistically indistinguishable367\nfrom control fish after 30 minutes and remained so at 60 minutes. In contrast, whole-body368\ncortisol concentrations in the predator-exposed group remained highly elevated after 60 minutes,369\nsignificantly exceeding levels attained after 15 minutes. We interpret these data to indicate that370\nthe magnitude of the initial response to both stressors was similar, resulting in similar whole-371\nbody cortisol concentrations at 15 minutes, but that the HPI axis in the predator-exposed fish372\nremained active for longer, resulting in a greater accumulation of whole-body cortisol with time.373\nThe overall significant difference in total cortisol between the two treatment groups detected374\nacross all time points indicates a quantitative difference in the response of the fish to the two375\nstressors.376\nOther studies have found evidence for a more rapid recovery to baseline cortisol levels377\nfollowing less threatening situations compared to more threatening situations [55]. A longer-378\nlasting cortisol response to threat of predation as compared to other stressors has been379\ndocumented in stonechats [56] and rodents [57,58]. Therefore in this experiment, we hypothesize380\nthat the different time course of the cortisol response to a competitor versus to a predator is381\nrelated to the perceived magnitude of the two different challenges. Sticklebacks are social fish,382\nand frequently interact with other sticklebacks in shoals. Because encounters with conspecifics383\nare frequent, natural selection might have favored individuals which do not mount a severe stress384\nresponse to frequent interactions with conspecifics, and should favor individuals which recover385\nquickly from fights. In contrast, encounters with predators are less frequent and more threatening386\n18\nthan encounters with conspecifics, so selection might have favored individuals with a greater and387\nlonger-lasting stress response.388\nThe levels of whole-body cortisol detected in unstressed sticklebacks during the present389\nstudy were similar to those previously reported for this species (2 \u2013 8 ng g-1; [46]) and levels390\ndetected in the stressed fish in the present study, although slightly higher, were also broadly391\nconsistent with previous observations (50 ng g-1;[46]). The difference in magnitude of whole-392\nbody cortisol levels between this and previous studies may be related to the nature of the393\nstressor.394\nLinks between stress-induced blood cortisol levels and behavioral traits have been shown395\nin fish [10,23], mammals [59] and reptiles [9]. However, while exposure to both stressors elicited396\na behavioral and whole-body cortisol response in the treatment groups, we did not detect a397\nrelationship at the individual level between concentrations of whole-body cortisol and behavior.398\nIt is possible that our method might not have had the resolution to detect fine-scale individual399\ndifferences.400\nWe did not detect any sex differences in whole-body cortisol. The stress response in401\nvertebrates, including fish [60], is modulated by gonadal steroids with androgens suppressing402\nand estrogens enhancing corticosteroid responsiveness [61]. However, the fish employed in this403\nstudy were not reproductively active and it is therefore unsurprising that no sex-dependent404\ndifferences in stress response were observed.405\n406\n19\nThe monoamine responses to a conspecific and a predator were qualitatively different407\nWhereas the cortisol response was broadly similar across stressors, the monoamines408\nshowed a differential response across the two stressors, some being suppressed in response to a409\nconspecific but elevated in response to the predator.410\nFor example, relative to the control group, concentrations of NE were consistently higher411\nin the \u2018predator\u2019 treatments, and lower in the \u2018conspecific\u2019 treatments. Without data on the NE412\nmetabolite, MHPG, we cannot distinguish if reduced concentrations reflect a reduction in NE413\nrelease (decrease in NE activity) or an increased turnover to MHPG (increase in NE activity).414\nHowever, at an individual level we found that NE was consistently associated with risk-taking415\nbehaviors in both kinds of situations: NE was positively correlated with aggressive behaviors as416\nwell as predator inspection behaviors. These positive correlations suggest that more bold or417\naggressive individuals were more \u2018aroused\u2019, active or uninhibited, results which are consistent418\nwith other studies showing positive relationships between NE activity and behavioral impulsivity419\nin monkeys [28] and sensation seeking in humans [62]. The fact that serotonin and NE had420\nopposite relationships with risk-taking behaviors in this experiment is consistent with the421\nobservation that 5-HT and catecholamines can have antagonistic effects on behavior [17].422\n423\nAssociations between serotonin, risk-taking behaviors and aggression424\nIn agreement with other studies which have shown that risk-taking behaviors are425\nnegatively associated with brain serotonergic activity [24,27-29], we found that risk-taking426\nbehaviors performed while under predation risk (e.g. inspection) were negatively correlated with427\nserotonin turnover to 5-HIAA (Figure 4C).428\n20\nOur results support the view that 5-HT has an inhibitory effect on aggressive behavior429\n[16,54]. We found a negative relationship at the individual level between concentrations of 5-HT430\nand aggressive behavior, and that confrontation by an unfamiliar conspecific resulted in lower 5-431\nHT. Other studies have shown that winners of agonistic interactions have up-regulated brain 5-432\nHT activity [21,30-32]. One possible explanation for this different pattern is that in our433\nexperiment, there was no physical contact between the resident and the intruder because the434\nintruders were confined to a flask. As a result, the resident fish were unable to complete their435\nattacks and therefore might not be analogous to the winners in the forementioned studies. We436\nremain provisional in our interpretation of these results because 5-HIAA was degraded in many437\nof the samples in the \u2018conspecific\u2019 treatments, preventing us from calculating serotonin turnover438\nin those treatments. However, it is worth noting that while more aggressive behaviors were439\nnegatively associated with serotonin (Figure 3A), risk-taking behavior under predation risk440\nshowed the opposite pattern \u2013 it was positively correlated with 5HT (Figure 4B), and negatively441\nassociated with serotonin turnover to 5-HIAA (Figure 4C).442\nOverall, these data provide evidence that the response of fish to stressors is not identical443\nregardless of the nature of the challenge, but rather that the response varies according to the444\nmagnitude, frequency and predictability of the stressor, as is the case for other vertebrates445\n[56,63]. Further studies on individual variation in responses to different stressors would benefit446\nfrom repeated sampling of the same physiological measures on the same individuals. While it is447\ncurrently a challenge to measure brain monoamines noninvasively, noninvasive methods for448\nmeasuring glucocorticoids in fish [64] are a promising alternative. In addition, the roles played449\nby upstream elements of the stress response such as corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and450\nvariation in the binding characteristics of corticosteroid receptors and corticotropin binding451\n21\nproteins should also be investigated [65]. Given that other studies have shown that inter-452\nindividual differences in stress responsiveness have a high heritable component [66], further453\ninvestigation will provide insight into the mechanisms that have produced adaptive, heritable454\nbehavioral variation in sticklebacks in diverse ecological settings.455\n456\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS457\n458\nWe thank Stuart Wilson, David Alvarez, Susie Coyle for help with the fish, Andy Young for459\ncatching the pike, Per-Ove Th\u00f6rnqvist and Joachim Schjolden for technical assistance with460\nHPLC and brain punches, Kim Pulman for technical help with the cortisol RIA.
