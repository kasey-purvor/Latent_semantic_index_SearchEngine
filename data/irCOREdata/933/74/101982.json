INTRODUCTION\nExperimental and theoretical investigations of chaotic\nsynchronization in coupled nonlinear systems have attracted\nmuch attention in recent years due to the possibility of prac-\ntical applications of this fundamental phenomenon. Several\npapers have studied the synchronization of chaotic signals in\nthe context of electronic circuits @1\u20133#, secure communica-\ntion @4\u20136#, turbulence in fluids @7,8#, chemical and biological\nsystems @9#, and laser dynamics @10\u201314#. Winful and Rah-\nman have numerically investigated the possibility of syn-\nchronization of chaos in semiconductor laser arrays on a\nnanosecond time scale @10# and previously, we have also\nperformed experimental measurements and demonstrated\nsynchronization of two chaotic lasers @15#. To our knowl-\nedge, however, the experimental synchronization of chaos in\nlaser arrays with more than two lasers has yet to be reported.\nIn this paper, the synchronization, both experimentally\nand numerically, of three coupled, chaotic, Nd:YAG ~triva-\nlent neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet! lasers in\nthe separate cases of pump and loss modulation is reported.\nIn a linear array of three lasers, a high degree of synchroni-\nzation between the two outer lasers is seen, while little if any\nsynchronization is observed between the outer and inner la-\nsers. The experimental observations are in good agreement\nwith analytical results, which clearly explain the lack of syn-\nchronization between outer and inner laser. Similar results\nwere seen by Winful and Rahman @10# in a numerical model\nfor three semiconductor lasers coupled in a linear array.\nThe numerical simulations show similar behavior in this\ncoupled linear array of three lasers to that seen in a system of\ntwo coupled lasers @14# and we present numerical evidence\nto suggest that synchronization between the two outer lasers\nmay be lost through a blowout bifurcation, where an attractor\n*Present address: Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Uni-\nversity of Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, U.K.\n\u2020Present address: School of Physics and Technology, Suzhou Uni-\nversity, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, P.R.O.C.PRE 591063-651X\/99\/59~4!\/4036~8!\/$15.00contained within the synchronized submanifold loses its\ntransverse stability @16#. This indicates that as in the two\nlaser case, forced symmetry breaking is not necessary for\ndesynchronization of the two outer lasers to occur.\nThe rest of this paper is arranged as follows. In Sec. II we\ndescribe the experimental setup for a system of three\nNd:YAG lasers coupled in a linear array and explain the\ntechniques that we used in obtaining the experimental data.\nSection III describes the equations we used to model the\nlaser system and investigates the occurrence of synchroniza-\ntion between the two outer lasers and also the lack of syn-\nchronization between the outer and inner laser. In Sec. IV,\nwe describe how the numerical simulations were performed\nin the case of loss modulation and finally, in Sec. V, we\ndiscuss our findings and consider the implications for cou-\npling large systems of lasers in a linear array.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nTo study the dynamics of a pump or loss modulated three\nlaser array we use the experimental system as shown in Fig.\n1. This setup consists of three equal intensity, parallel and\nlaterally separated beams created by pumping a Nd:YAG\nrod, 5 mm in both length and diameter in a plane parallel\ncavity. Three Ar1 pump beams (l5514.5 nm! are formed\nby passing a single beam through a fan-out grating designed\nto produce equal intensities for the zeroth- and first-order\nbeams, and negligible intensities elsewhere. The separation\nand relative orientation of the three beams of interest are\ncontrolled using a simple telescope. The pump beams, in the\nend, are parallel and symmetric with respect to the axis of the\nYAG crystal. The optical cavity consists of one high reflec-\ntion coated end face of the rod and of an external planar\noutput coupler with 2% transmittance. The pump power for\nthe pump modulation case is approximately 5.8 W, and 5.0\nW for the loss modulation case. For these parameters, the\nrelaxation oscillation frequency, nR , is of the order of 100\nkHz. A thick etalon ensures single longitudinal mode opera-\ntion. This etalon doubles as an intracavity acousto-optical\nmodulator ~AOM! for the loss modulation case. Pump modu-4036 \u00a91999 The American Physical Society\nPRE 59 4037SYNCHRONIZATION OF CHAOS IN AN ARRAY OF . . .lation is attained using an AOM positioned before the fan-\nout grating.\nThermal lensing in the YAG rod, generated by Ar1 pump\nbeams with waist radii '20 mm allows the formation of\nthree separate and stable cavities @11#. The TEM00 infrared\nlaser beams generated in the YAG crystal have radii\n'200 mm. Radii are measured at 1\/e2 of the maximum\nintensity of the Gaussian profile. The coupling between the\nbeams is determined by their nearest-neighbor separation,\nwhich can be shifted by adjusting the grating and the tele-\nscope lenses\u2019 positions. The pump beam separations and pro-\nfiles are measured directly using a rotating slit method. The\nminimum value for nearest-neighbor separation used was\n0.64 mm, for which there is no appreciable overlap of the\npump beams and coupling is entirely due to the spatial over-\nlap of the infrared laser fields. The couplings and detunings\nwere chosen such that, in the absence of modulation, the\nlasers exhibit an instability caused by the resonance of the\nFIG. 1. Experimental system for generating three laterally\ncoupled lasers in a Nd:YAG crystal and observing the synchroniza-\ntion of chaotic laser intensities. A diffractive optic is used to split\nthe argon laser into three beams with almost equal intensities. The\nthree beams are made parallel by a telescope; changing the magni-\nfication of the telescope changes the separation d between each\nlaser. An Acousto-Optic Modulator ~AOM! is placed in position ~a!\nin the case of loss modulation and in position ~b!, in the case of\npump modulation. The Nd:YAG crystal is coated for high reflectiv-\nity ~HR! on one side and antireflection coated ~AR! on the other.\nThe output coupler ~OC! is 2% transmissive; both mirrors are flat.\nA charge-coupled device camera is used to measure the far-field\nintensity pattern of the array, while the three photodetectors PD1,\nPD2, and PD3 simultaneously measure each laser\u2019s intensity dy-\nnamics, which are subsequently recorded on a digital sampling os-\ncilloscope ~DSO!.phase dynamics with the relaxation oscillations as described,\nfor example, in @13#.\nThe three infrared beams produced by the Nd:YAG laser\nare separated using a sequence of non-polarizing cube beam\nsplitters and prisms. The intensity dynamics of the individual\nlasers are recorded simultaneously using fast photodiodes\nand a four-channel digital oscilloscope. A scanning Fabry-\nPe\u00b4rot interferometer is utilized to ensure that the individual\nlasers have only a single longitudinal mode.\nExperimental measurements for the pump modulated case\nare displayed in Fig. 2 for nearest-neighbor separations of\napproximately 0.975 mm. Chaotic synchronization between\nthe two outer lasers is clearly seen, whereas there is no ap-\nparent synchronization between outer and inner lasers. In the\ncase of loss modulation they are displayed in Fig. 3 for\nnearest-neighbor separations of approximately 0.64 mm. De-\nspite additional noise present in the loss modulated experi-\nmental setup, chaotic synchronization between lasers 1 and 3\nis readily apparent.

TERRY et al.2, as well as lasers 3 and 2, show little synchrony.\nIt is interesting to note the harmonic relationships be-\ntween the side lasers, 1 and 3, and the center beam, laser 2.\nThe intensity of laser 2 oscillates at a rate approaching twice\nthe frequency of the side beam oscillations. Figure 4 com-\npares the power spectrums of the individual beams. The\ndominant peak of the central beam approaches 150 kHz\nwhile the side beams display peaks at approximately 80 kHz.\nThe sharp spike at 166 kHz is due to modulation at this\nfrequency.\nThe intensity time series dynamics of all three lasers was\nnumerically estimated to be five dimensional ~Fig. 5!, using a\nfalse nearest-neighbors method @17#, with 25 000 time units\nconsidered. This result agrees with the dynamically invariant\nstate labeled amplitude antisynchronized in Table I, corre-\nsponding to a system with amplitude synchronization and\nequal left and right detunings present.\nIII.

It is assumed that not both the pump and the loss\nare modulated at the same time. In the Nd:YAG lasers con-\nsidered in the experiments, the round-trip time of light in the\ncavity tc is 0.4020.50 ns, while the decay time of the upper\nlasing level t f is '240 ms. V is the modulation frequency\nand is chosen to be near the relaxation frequency.\nThe lasers are coupled linearly to one another with\nstrength k i j , assumed to be small. For laser beams of Gauss-\nian intensity profile and 1\/e2 beam radius w0 the coupling\nstrength, as determined from overlap integral of the two elec-\ntric fields i and j is defined as\nk i j[expS 2 ~di2d j!22w02 D . ~2!\nThe coupling strength is normalized such that k i j51 if\ndi2d j50. As the coupling between lasers 1 and 3 is as-\nsumed negligible, only nearest-neighbor coupling is consid-\nered in 1.\nIn the analysis that follows we only consider the case of\nloss modulation, i.e., p115p125p1350, but note that the\nanalysis is equally valid in the case of pump modulation\n@18#.\nWe first let Ei5Xieif i where Xi is the amplitude and f i\nthe phase of laser i and rescale time, expressed in units of the\nround-trip time of light around the cavity tc . We subse-\nquently introduce FL5f22f1 and FR5f22f3 ~and simi-\nlarly for DL and DR), so that we may rewrite Eqs. ~1! as the\nfollowing system of ordinary differential equations defined\non R8,\ndX1\ndt 5@F12e1~ t !#X12kX2cos~FL!,\ndF1\ndt 5g~A2F12F1X1\n2!,\ndX2\ndt 5@F22e2~ t !#X22k\u0084X1cos~FL!1X3cos~FR!\u0085,\ndF2\ndt 5g~A2F22F2X2\n2!,\n~3!\ndX3\ndt 5@F32e3~ t !#X32kX2cos~FR!,\ndF3\ndt 5g~A2F32F3X3\n2!,\ndFL\ndt 5DL1kXS X2X1 1X1X2D sin~FL!1 X3X2sin~FR!C,\ndFR\ndt 5DR1kXS X3X2 1X2X3D sin~FR!1 X1X2sin~FL!C.\nThe issue of synchronization between the two outer lasers\nmay be addressed by introducing the sum and difference of\nthese lasers and assuming that all three lasers are equally\ndetuned, i.e., DL5DR50. Then, X1315 12 (X11X3),X1325 12 (X12X3),F1315 12 (F11F3),F1325 12 (F12F3), and\nsynchronization between the two outer lasers occurs when\nX1325F13250.

It is interesting to note that all three\nlasers are phase synchronized when k is negative, corre-\nsponding to FL5FR50. However, only the two outer lasers\nare phase synchronized when k is positive and this is the\nphysically relevant situation since k is assumed positive in\nsome sense.\nOwing to these symmetries, the dynamically invariant\nsubspaces illustrated in Table I exist. Notice, in particular,\nthe five-dimensional subspace labeled amplitude antisyn-\nchronized, corresponding to the case where the m symmetry\nhas been broken, via equal detuning of the two outer beams\nfrom a common cavity mode. The dimensionality of the ex-\nperimental system as calculated using the false nearest-\nneighbor method gives good agreement with this state and\ngives emphasis to our assumptions about the parameter re-\ngimes considered.\nNote that although there are several invariant subspaces\nwhere the phases of all three lasers are locked, there are no\ninvariant subspaces forced by symmetry such that all the\namplitude and gains are equal, X15X2 and F15F2 . We\nmay examine this using two approaches; first by examining\nthe set of such points in the phase space and showing that it\nis not invariant ~cf. @19#! and second by reducing the system\nof three lasers to one of two lasers with unequal coupling.\nTo this end, we define the manifold\nM125$~X1 ,F1 ,X2 ,F2 ,X3 ,F3 ,FL ,FR! :\nX15X2 ,F15F2 & FR50 or p%\ncorresponding to perfect ~anti!synchronization between la-\nsers 1 and 2 in terms of the original variables.\nA.

We eliminate the first possi-\nbility by assumption. If X350 then we note that\ndX3\ndt 52kX2cos~FR! ~4!\nand so this will be nonzero as long as FR\u00de(p\/2)1kp for\nsome kPZ, but from our definition ofM12 ,FR50 or p , so\nany trajectory satisfying Eq. ~4! will not be contained in\nM12 . For the same reason we rule out the case FR5(p\/2)\n1kp and this implies that a trajectory can only be in M12\nfor an instant in time. As a result, M12 is only an invariant\nsubspace for the ordinary differential equation if k50 and\nthe only trajectories that remain withinM12 for all time have\nX15X25X350.\nB. Reduction to a system of two lasers with unequal coupling\nIf we assume that we lie on one of the amplitude synchro-\nnized subspaces, where X25F250, i.e., X15X3 and F1\n5F3 , then the system ~3! simplifies to a two laser system\nwith unequal coupling between the two lasers.\ndX1\ndt 5@F12e~ t !#X12kX2 cos~F!,\ndF1\ndt 5g~A2F12F1X1\n2!,\ndX2\ndt 5@F22e~ t !#X222kX1 cos~F!, ~5!\ndF2\ndt 5g~A2F22F2X2\n2!,\ndF\ndt 5k~X2X1\n2112X1X2\n21!sin~F!.\nIntroducing sum and difference variables in this case gives\nus the transformed system,dX1\ndt 5X1\u0084F12e~ t !\u00851F2X22k cos~F!~3X11X2!,\ndF1\ndt 5g\u0084A2F1~11X1\n2 1X2\n2 !22F2X2X1\u0085,\ndX2\ndt 5X2\u0084F12e~ t !\u00851F2X11k cos~F!~3X21X1!,\n~6!\ndF2\ndt 52g\u0084F2~11X1\n2 1X2\n2 !12F1X2X1\u0085,\ndF\ndt 5k\nS 3S X12 1 23 X1X21X22 D\n~X1\n2 2X2\n2 !\nD sin~F!\nIf we assume that the two lasers X1 and X2 are synchronized\nthen we find that\ndX2\ndt 5k cos~F!X1 ,\ndF2\ndt 50, ~7!\ndF\ndt 53k sin~F!,\nassuming that k\u00de0,X1\u00de0, then we see that X250 for at\nmost an instant in time.

Consequently dX2 \/dt moves away from 0 and so\nX2 also moves from 0. Therefore synchronization is not\nachieved in the asymmetric two laser setup and thus not\nachieved in the original three laser system.\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nWe carried out numerical simulations independently in\nboth the loss modulation situation as well as modulation of\nthe pump excitation. We concentrate on the loss modulated\nsituation due to numerical considerations, but note that our\nresults remain valid in the case of pump modulation @18#.\nA. Loss modulated case\nFor the loss modulated case, the simulations were per-\nformed using both Bulirsch-Stoer and Runge-Kutta integra-\ntors. Due to numerical considerations we were forced to con-\nsider more moderate values of the stiffness parameter g ,\nwhich was of the order 0.01 and 0.001. The parameter re-\ngimes considered were also altered in order that the differ-\nence in g was taken into account. In both the cases g\n50.01 and g50.001 we saw similar results, and although\nPRE 59 4041SYNCHRONIZATION OF CHAOS IN AN ARRAY OF . . .the experiments were carried out with g'1026, the use of\nlonger resonators would give a value of the stiffness param-\neter somewhat closer to that considered numerically. We car-\nried out simulations for many values of the pump coefficient\nand various modulation strengths for the loss.\nAs in the model for a two laser system, in the case 0\n,g!1, the system undergoes a period doubling cascade to\nchaos as the strength of loss modulation is increased. Typi-\ncally we see that for small values of the coupling parameter\nk , there is no amplitude synchronization and the amplitude\nbehavior of all three lasers appears to be independent, al-\nthough with antiphase synchronization between adjacent la-\nsers. As the coupling strength is increased, a period of on-off\nintermittent type behavior @20#, is observed in the amplitude\nfluctuations of the two outer lasers. During this period there\nare times when the two outer lasers appear to be synchro-\nnized in both amplitude and phase, before bursts away from\namplitude synchronization, while remaining completely\nphase ~anti!synchronized. Then as the coupling strength is\nincreased still further, there is no more bursting away from\nsynchrony and the two outer lasers remain amplitude syn-\nchronized for all time after an initial transient phase.\nFor the particular case where all losses are modulated\nequally at the rate, 0.9 1 0.2 cos ~0.045 t!, the pump param-\neters were equal to 1.2 for each laser and DL5DR50, the\nbehavior of a typical trajectory is as follows. Upon varying\nthe strength of coupling k , we see that there exists a critical\nvalue kc;0.003 125 such that for values of k,kc , trajecto-\nries evolve on to the phase antisynchronized state. For values\nof k.kc trajectories evolve on to the amplitude antisynchro-\nnized state. This transition at kc is strongly suggestive of a\nblowout bifurcation, as was the case in a system of two lasers\n@14#.\nA blowout bifurcation occurs when a normal Lyapunov\nexponent governing the exponential rate of change transverse\nFIG. 6.

We assumed the\ndetunings of the lasers were such that DL5DR50. We have labeled\nthe largest tangential Lyapunov exponent L1 .

These correspond to the periods where L1 is\nnegative. The blowout occurs when the normal Lyapunov exponent,\nl1 passes through 0. In this case this occurs for k;0.003 125.to a submanifold of the total phase space passes through 0. In\nthe case where there is more than one transverse Lyapunov\nexponent we need consider only the largest or normal\nLyapunov exponent. If the normal exponent is negative, then\non average nearby trajectories are attracted onto the sub-\nmanifold and the attractor within the subspace is an attractor\nfor the full system. If the exponent is positive then on aver-\nage trajectories close to the submanifold are repelled away\nfrom it.\nWe have numerically computed the Lyapunov exponents\nof Eq. ~3! by integrating the variational equations and exam-\nine the change that occurs in the exponents upon varying the\ncoupling strength k . These are illustrated in the case of no\ndetunings in Fig 6.\nFor this system, the blowout bifurcation does not occur at\nan isolated parameter value because the bifurcation param-\neter k varies the dynamics tangentially within the antisyn-\nchronized subspace as well as those in a transverse direction\nfrom it; it is not a normal parameter for the dynamics\n@21,22#. Because of this ~and apparent fragility of the chaotic\nattractors! we do not expect the Lyapunov exponents to vary\nsmoothly or even continuously with the parameter. Hence we\nobserve a blurred blowout @22#.\nThe tangential variation of the dynamics is clearly indi-\ncated in Figs. 6 and 7, where windows of stability arise as\nthe coupling strength k is increased. These windows of sta-\nbility correspond to all Lyapunov exponents of system ~3!\nbeing negative. In particular, there is a window of stability\nshortly after the bifurcation point.\nIn order to examine the branching behavior at blowout,\nwe have simulated the behavior of typical trajectories that\nare not in any invariant subspace. Starting at kc , there ap-\npears to exist a chaotic attractor A within the antisynchro-\nnized subspace, since after an initial transient phase ~which\nmay be prolonged for some initial conditions!, all trajectories\neventually appear to converge to the antisynchronized sub-\nFIG. 7.

The parameter values for the lasers were assumed\nidentical and were once again a0i50.9,a1i50.2,pi51.2 ~for i\n51,2,3). We have labeled the largest tangential Lyapunov expo-\nnent L1 and the normal Lyapunov exponent l1 . Similar behavior\nto the case of no left and right detuning is seen. However, the point\nof blowout is altered, in this case k;0.003 175.\n4042 PRE 59JOHN R. TERRY et al.FIG. 8. Numerical simulated three laser model with pump modulation.

Reducing k towards kc we find regions of region of\non-off intermittent type behavior, typical for a supercritical\nblowout.\nAfter the blowout, we no longer observe any attractors in\nthe antisynchronized subspace, but there is a new branch of\nattractors in the phase antisynchronized subspace are created\nat the bifurcation. Just after kc these attractors are apparently\non-off intermittent and close to the antisynchronized sub-\nspace. The average position of the trajectory moves away as\nk!0. This is a strong indicator that the blowout is of super-\ncritical, soft or nonhysteretic type @16#.\nWe also performed simulations of three loss modulated\nlasers in situations where the detunings were equal, i.e.,\nDL5DR5D . We calculated the Lyapunov spectrum in this\ncase and saw similar results to that of the purely symmetric\ncase, with the main difference being a bifurcation from the\namplitude antisynchronized subspace, rather than the anti-\nsynchronized subspace. Again the blowout appears to be soft\nwith an extended period of on-off intermittent behavior.\nFor the particular case with parameters identical to those\nconsidered above and a value of the detuning, D50.001, the\nLyapunov spectrum upon varying k is illustrated in Fig. 7.\nAgain a blurred blowout is evident, and the normal\nLyapunov exponent passes through zero at kc;0.003 175.\nB. Pump modulation\nThe numerical simulations in the case of modulation of\nthe pump excitation were carried out using a Runge-Kutta\nintegrator with a variable time step. Frequency of the depth\nof modulation was chosen so that the dynamics of the system\nwas in a region of chaotic behavior and in this case was\nchosen to be 100.53 kHz ~in the case of loss modulation it\nwas 139.62 kHz!. As in the case of loss modulation, excel-\nlent agreement between the experimental results and the nu-\nmerical simulations are seen. A high degree of synchroniza-\ntion between the two outer lasers and no apparentsynchronization between outer and inner laser. The transient\nbehavior displayed similar characteristics when compared to\nthe loss modulated simulations, such as bursts away from\nsynchronization over short time scales, before settling on to\nthe synchronized subspace after longer periods of time.\nSome of the numerical simulations we performed are il-\nlustrated in Fig. 8. The bifurcation analysis is not performed\nhere, since the simulations indicate similar bifurcation be-\nhavior to that of the loss modulated case, as would be ex-\npected @18#.\nV. DISCUSSION\nConcluding this work, the synchronization of three class\nB Nd:YAG lasers, coupled in a straight line linear array, is\ninvestigated experimentally, analytically and numerically.\nWe investigate the separate cases of pump modulation and\nloss modulation both experimentally and numerically. In the\nexperiments, a high degree of synchronization is observed\nbetween the two outer lasers of the array, while no synchro-\nnization is observed between outer and inner lasers. This is\nin good agreement with the theory, which demonstrates this\nlack of synchronization between outer and inner laser. In the\ncase of loss modulation we see numerically how the loss of\nsynchronization between the two outer lasers is lost in both\nthe fully symmetric case and in the case with equal left and\nright detunings, via an apparent supercritical blowout bifur-\ncation. This is achieved by varying the strength of coupling\nbetween the three lasers.\nFor the experimental system, noise and symmetry break-\ning are both inherent, but even with quite high levels of\nnoise, we have demonstrated a good degree of synchroniza-\ntion particularly in the loss modulated case. In the numerical\nsimulations, noise and symmetry breaking have similar ef-\nfects; in the region of on-off intermittency, it is unlikely that\nthere will be a noticeable change if the perturbations are\nPRE 59 4043SYNCHRONIZATION OF CHAOS IN AN ARRAY OF . . .small. Low levels of noise and imperfections can result in\nbubbling type effects @23#, which can resemble on-off inter-\nmittency in numerical simulations. Consequently, the effect\nof bubbling on systems such as ours is similar to the effects\nof on-off intermittency, namely bursts away from a synchro-\nnized state. Such bubbling persists up to a point known as a\nbubbling transition @24# ~see also the related riddling bifur-\ncation @25#!. This situation arises when an orbit embedded in\na symmetric chaotic attractor loses its transverse stability. A\nmore detailed description of this situation may be found in\n@26#.\nIt is interesting to see the harmonic relationships between\nthe central and the outer beams. Particularly for the loss\nmodulated case with small nearest-neighbor separations, the\ncentral beam appeared to be at a rate approaching twice that\nof the two outer beams. We conjecture that this surprising\nphenomenon may be caused by the central beam communi-\ncating a greater quantity of information than the two outer\nbeams. One area of future research is to investigate these\ndynamics and examine the effect of parameter variation on\nthe harmonic relationship.\nAlthough we have shown that there will be no synchroni-\nzation between the outer and inner lasers in a three laser\narray, the question of generalized synchronization @27#\narises. As we have shown, assuming that the two outer lasers\nare synchronized allows us to simplify the model to a system\nof two lasers with unequal coupling between the two lasers.\nThis does not immediately fall into the category of general-ized synchronization, since there is feedback from the \u2018\u2018re-\nsponse\u2019\u2019 system into the \u2018\u2018driving\u2019\u2019 system. However, it may\nstill be possible to make similar conclusions to those of gen-\neralized synchronization in the case where the feedback from\nthe one system is small compared to the input from the other.\nNumerical simulations of the model suggests that for\nsmall symmetry breaking perturbations of the amplitude syn-\nchronized state, an instability should arise in the phase lock-\ning of the three lasers as predicted analytically and numeri-\ncally in a system of two lasers coupled in a linear straight\nline array @19#. Another interesting area of future experimen-\ntal work would be to heterodyne the outer beams, examine\nthe beat frequencies over time to investigate the phase-\nlocking instability. Such an instability may have an impor-\ntant bearing on maximizing power output and coherence in\nlarger arrays of coupled lasers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nJ.T. and P.A. gratefully acknowledge the support of the\nEPSRC via Grant No. GR\/K77365.
