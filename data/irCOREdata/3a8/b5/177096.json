It produces high-quality research information on the \neffectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care \nin the NHS. \u2018Health technologies\u2019 are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent \nand treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care.\nThe research findings from the HTA Programme directly influence decision-making bodies such as the \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the National Screening Committee \n(NSC). HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they \nform a key component of the \u2018National Knowledge Service\u2019.\nThe HTA Programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS. There are three \nroutes to the start of projects.\nFirst is the commissioned route. Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the \nNHS, from the public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS \ntrusts. These suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts (including NHS service \nusers). The HTA Programme then commissions the research by competitive tender.\nSecond, the HTA Programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research \nquestions. These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS, and scientific rigour.\nThird, through its Technology Assessment Report (TAR) call-off contract, the HTA Programme \ncommissions bespoke reports, principally for NICE, but also for other policy-makers. TARs bring together \nevidence on the value of specific technologies.\nSome HTA research projects, including TARs, may take only months, others need several years. They \ncan cost from as little as \u00a340,000 to over \u00a31 million, and may involve synthesising existing evidence, \nundertaking a trial, or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem.\nThe final reports from HTA projects are peer reviewed by a number of independent expert referees before \npublication in the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment.\nCriteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series\nReports are published in the HTA journal series if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA \nProgramme, and (2) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and \neditors.\nReviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed \u2018systematic\u2019 when the account of the search, appraisal \nand synthesis methods (to minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication \nof the review by others.\nThe research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned by the HTA Programme as project \nnumber 04\/38\/03. The contractual start date was in July 2005. The draft report began editorial review \nin December 2006 and was accepted for publication in March 2008. As the funder, by devising a \ncommissioning brief, the HTA Programme specified the research question and study design. The authors \nhave been wholly responsible for all data collection, analysis and interpretation, and for writing up their \nwork.

Consequently, \nnewer procedures using alternative energy sources \nhave been developed. Some do not require a \ngeneral anaesthetic, are carried out in outpatient \nsettings and have fewer adverse effects. However, \nthere is uncertainty about their clinical effectiveness \nand cost-effectiveness. This review aimed to:\ndetermine the clinical effectiveness of  \u2022\t\nalternative procedures\nmodel estimates of cost and cost utility \u2022\t\nrank the clinical effectiveness and risk profile  \u2022\t\nof newer procedures in terms of benefits, risks \nand cost-effectiveness\nidentify areas for future research. \u2022\t\nDescription of proposed \ninterventions\nSurgery for BPE can be divided into \u2018minimally \ninvasive\u2019 and \u2018tissue ablative\u2019 treatments. Minimally \ninvasive procedures include transurethral \nmicrowave therapy (TUMT), transurethral needle \nablation (TUNA), transurethral ethanol ablation \nof the prostate (TEAP) and transurethral laser \ncoagulation. Tissue ablative procedures are as \ninvasive as TURP and include laser prostatectomy, \nlaser vaporisation, transurethral vaporisation of the \nprostate (TUVP), transurethral vaporesection of \nthe prostate (TUVRP), and bipolar TURP, TUVP \nand TUVRP. Although the ablative techniques \nare grouped together for the purposes of this \nreview, there are differences in the method of \nablation of the prostate with some techniques using \nvaporisation (e.g. TUVP) compared with those \nusing resection [e.g. holmium laser enucleation of \nthe prostate (HoLEP)].\nMethods\nClinical effectiveness\nElectronic searches of 13 databases were conducted \nto identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of \nsurgical interventions for BPE. Selected conference \nproceedings were hand searched, websites \nconsulted and reference lists scanned.\nTwo reviewers independently assessed study quality \nand extracted data. The International Prostate \nSymptom Score\/American Urological Association \n(IPSS\/AUA) symptom score was the primary \noutcome; other outcomes included quality of life, \npeak urine flow rate and adverse effects.\nCost-effectiveness \nA Markov model was produced reflecting likely care \npathways. Parameter estimates were derived from \nthe systematic review of clinical effectiveness, a \nreview of previous economic evaluations and other \nUK relevant sources.\nResults\nA total of 156 reports describing 88 RCTs were \nincluded. The majority had fewer than 100 \nparticipants (range 12\u2013234). \nTURP provided a consistent, high level of long-\nterm symptom improvement. Improvements in \nquality of life and flow rate were also observed. \nMinimally invasive procedures result in less \nimprovement in symptoms and flow rate. Ablative \nprocedures give similar symptom and quality of \nlife improvements to TURP. HoLEP additionally \nresulted in greater improvement in flow rate. \nIn terms of effectiveness, HoLEP appears to be \nunique amongst the newer technologies in offering \nan advantage over TURP, currently confined \nto urodynamic outcomes, which may not be of \nimportance to patients, although long-term follow-\nup data are lacking. Severe blood loss was more \ncommon following TURP. The rate of incontinence \nwas similar across all interventions other than for Executive summary\nx\nTUNA and laser coagulation, which reported lower \nrates. Acute retention and need for reoperation was \nmore common with newer technologies, especially \nthe minimally invasive interventions. \nThe economic model suggested that minimally \ninvasive procedures (represented by TUMT) were \nunlikely to be considered cost-effective compared \nwith TURP. Strategies involving TUMT with TURP \nas a second procedure as necessary were more \ncostly but had a similar effectiveness to TURP. \nOf the other ablative procedures, TUVP was less \ncostly than TURP (and also the least costly single \ntreatment considered) but less effective. HoLEP \nwas estimated to be more effective and less costly \nthan a single TURP but less effective than a \nstrategy involving repeating TURP if necessary. \nHowever, the base-case analysis suggested an 80% \nchance that a strategy of TUVP, followed by HoLEP \nif required, would be the cost-effective strategy at a \nthreshold of \u00a320,000 per quality-adjusted life-year \n(QALY). At an approximately \u00a350,000 threshold, \non average, TUVP, followed by TURP as required, \nwould be cost-effective, although considerable \nuncertainty surrounds this finding. \nSensitivity analyses\nAll changes found in the sensitivity analyses were \nintuitively sensible and their possible impact \ndepended on society\u2019s willingness to pay for a \nQALY. \nLimitations of the calculations \n(assumptions made)\nThe main limitations relate to the quantity and \nquality of the data available, in the context of \nmultiple comparisons. Many trials were under-\nreported or poorly reported; much of the \ninformation available was in a form that was \nunsuitable for meta-analysis. Obtaining cost \nestimates was not always straightforward and \ncosting under all resource categories was not \npossible. \nConclusions\nFor the NHS, increased use of TUVP and\/or \nHoLEP would lead to an increased requirement \nfor training, which may be costly; in addition, it \nwould take time to establish an adequate level of \nprovision. In the absence of strong evidence in \nfavour of newer methods, TURP remains both \nclinically effective and cost-effective. The use of \nminimally invasive technologies in the NHS is not \nappropriate until a more effective and\/or less costly \ntechnology is available.\nNeed for further research\nFor men who might currently be managed  1. \nmedically, a systematic review including \nmodelling to determine how many years of \nmedical treatment are necessary to offset the \ncost of treatment with a minimally invasive or \nablative intervention in the first instance.\nBetter research into the true costs of the  2. \ndifferent interventions as a critical driver of \neconomic evaluations.\nConsensus work in partnership with governing  3. \nbodies such as the British Association of \nUrological Surgeons to agree parameters for \nconducting future trials, such as standardising \ndefinitions and reporting of outcome measures.\nFor men judged to need ablative therapy, is  4. \nthere an alternative to TURP that is more \neffective, safe or cost-effective? A well-\nconducted head-to-head trial of treatment \nstrategies \u2013 TUVP followed by either TURP \nor HoLEP, versus HoLEP, versus TURP \u00d7 2 \u2013 \nwould be the most desirable to establish the \ngold standard. Such a trial should take prostate \nsize into account and should include direct \nmeasures of utility. Newer technologies could \nthen be compared against this gold standard \nand, given the rapid developments in this area, \na tracker trial approach may be appropriate.\nTrials of different strategies aimed at  5. \nimproving outcomes and minimising adverse \neffects after TURP, particularly bleeding.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The pathophysiology of benign \nenlargement involves hyperplasia of the epithelial \nand stromal components of the prostate gland \nleading to progressive obstruction of urine flow, \nand increased activity of the bladder (detrusor) \nmuscle. These secondary urodynamic changes \nof bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor \ndysfunction are thought to result in the typical \nbladder storage symptoms such as frequency and \nnocturia and voiding symptoms such as poor flow \nand intermittent stream. For simplicity, the variety \nof symptomatic effects are grouped together as \nlower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Although the \nprecise relationship between symptoms, prostate \nenlargement and detrusor dysfunction can be \ndebated, there is no doubt that removal of prostatic \ntissue in affected men results in improvement of \nsymptoms, urodynamic parameters and quality of \nlife. \nMen are diagnosed as suffering from clinical BPE \nby documenting a combination of storage and \nvoiding symptoms, finding a uniformly enlarged \nprostate gland on digital rectal examination \nand the measurement of a reduced peak urinary \nflow rate (Qmax). Qmax is normally used to predict \nresponse to surgery and acts as a proxy for \nurodynamic studies. Men with a Qmax of less than \n10 ml\/s are more likely to have urodynamically \nproven bladder outflow obstruction and as a result \nare more likely to have a good outcome after \nsurgery. The usefulness of other indicators of lower \nurinary tract function, in particular the diagnosis \nof bladder outlet obstruction by invasive pressure \nflow studies, continues to be debated. In general, \nsuch testing before surgery will reduce the number \nof men having a poor outcome at the expense \nof denying a proportion of men classified as not \nobstructed successful surgery. Because Qmax was the \nonly urodynamic inclusion criterion for the studies \nincluded in the systematic review, the utility of \nfurther testing has not been considered further.1\nThe diagnosis also requires exclusion of other \nlower urinary tract disorders by urinalysis, \nprostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and use of \na frequency\/volume chart. The severity of the \ndisorder is assessed using a validated symptom-\nscoring questionnaire, most commonly the \nInternational Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS).2 \nThis questionnaire asks the patient to rate \nvoiding symptoms (poor stream, intermittent \nflow, incomplete emptying, straining) and storage \nsymptoms (urgency, frequency, nocturia) on a scale \nfrom 0 (none) to 5 (very severe). Completion of \nthe IPSS yields a total score ranging from 0 to 35 \ndefining mild (score 0\u20137), moderate (score 8\u201319) \nand severe (score 20\u201335) symptomatic states. \nIn addition, a single disease-specific quality of \nlife question scores how bothersome symptoms \nare for each individual [range 0 (delighted) to 6 \n(terrible)]. This basic assessment is used to discuss \nmanagement options with each patient, which may \ninvolve lifestyle changes alone, drug treatment \nor invasive therapy to remove or ablate prostate \ntissue. In some men the predominant clinical \nproblem is characterised as a complication of BPE. \nThis can be recurrent lower urinary tract infection \n(UTI), bleeding (haematuria) or urinary retention. \nSuch complications are generally an indication for \ninvasive treatment to remove prostate tissue. Other \nassessment instruments include the well-validated \nAmerican Urological Association (AUA) symptom \nindex, which uses seven questions that are identical \nto the IPSS questions with the exception of the \ndisease-specific quality of life question, and \nthe Madsen\u2013Iversen index, which is no longer \nrecommended for assessing symptoms as it was \nnot designed to be self-administered by patients. \nThe Madsen\u2013Iversen index is usually completed \nby an interviewer and includes questions about \nstream, straining to void, hesitancy, intermittency, \nbladder emptying, incontinence, urgency, nocturia \nand frequency, with different symptoms attracting \ndifferent scoring schemes. Although providing \nsemi-objective symptom quantification, these \nquestionnaires, including the currently favoured \nIPSS, have been criticised for giving undue Background\n4\nweight to voiding symptoms at the expense of the \nsometimes more troublesome storage complaints.\nEpidemiology and natural history\nClinical BPE is a common disorder, affecting 30% \nof those older than 60 years and 40% of those \nolder than 70 years.3 What is becoming increasingly \nclear is the generally progressive nature of BPE.4,5 \nIn a randomised comparison with TURP, 30% of \nmen assigned to advice alone required prostate \nsurgery for progressive symptoms during a 3-year \nperiod of surveillance.6 Longitudinal community \nobservational studies such as that performed in \nOlmsted County, USA7 have shown an increase \nin both symptom severity and adverse effects on \nquality of life associated with progressive prostate \nenlargement and deterioration in urine flow. This \nstudy followed 2115 randomly selected white male \nresidents and found that 26% of men aged from \n40 to 49 years and 46% of men aged from 70 to \n79 years reported moderate to severe urinary \nsymptoms. Longitudinal data also confirmed an \nannual increase in prostate volume of 1.6%, an \noverall annual increase in symptom score of 0.298 \nand a consistent annual decline in peak flow of \n2% across all age groups.9 In the same cohort of \npatients there was an increased risk of acute urinary \nretention with increasing age, with baseline age, \nsymptom severity, prostate size and maximum \nflow rate identified as independent predictors.10 \nA potential drawback of such community-based \nstudies is the lack of histological confirmation of \nbenign hyperplasia, which in other studies has been \nfound to be present in 40% of men in their 50s and \naround 90% of men in their 80s.11\u201313 Although the \nnatural history of clinical BPE is more accurately \ndetermined using community-based cohorts such \nas in the Olmsted County study, further insights \nare gained from placebo arms of trials of drugs \nused to treat clinical BPE, such as the medical \ntherapy of prostatic symptoms (MTOPS) study14 \nwhich documented that the risk of BPE progression \naveraged 17% at 4 years. \nSignificance in terms of ill health\nThe combination of improved life expectancy and \nreduction in birth rate has resulted in an actual \nor predicted progressive ageing of the population \nin most communities worldwide. For men, it is \nestimated that the population of those aged over \n65 years reached 207 million in 2005, constituting \n6.38% of the world\u2019s male population.15 These \ndemographic changes inevitably result in an \nincreased prevalence of chronic health problems \nassociated with ageing. This has been shown for \nclinical BPE by a number of epidemiological \nstudies.16 The prevalence of moderate to severe \nsymptoms progressively increases from 18% of men \nin their 40s to 56% of those in their 70s.17 The \nbothersome nature of urinary symptoms is linked \nto adverse changes in quality of life and drives \nmen to seek medical advice and treatment. In the \npast the range of treatment was limited to open or \nendoscopic removal of the prostate but now options \ninclude single or combination drug therapy, \nphytotherapy and the application of various energy \nsources to remove or ablate prostate tissue. The \nincreased range of therapies has encouraged more \nmen to seek help to alleviate their symptoms \nand has led to a widening of the indications for \ninterventional treatments. Thus, although it is \nrarely a life-threatening problem, clinical BPE \nrepresents a major and increasing health condition \nthat consumes a significant proportion of health-\ncare expenditure.18 \nThe goals of treatment of clinical BPE are to \nreduce the severity of symptoms together with the \nbother that they cause, to normalise the dynamics \nof the lower urinary tract and to resolve or prevent \ncomplications. Treatment options balance likely \nbenefits with possible occurrence and severity \nof side effects. Simple reassurance and lifestyle \nadvice can be sufficient for those men without \nmuch bother but they incur the risk of later \ncomplications. Drug treatment can be effective \nfor relief of symptoms and evidence suggests that \nlong-term treatment with a drug combination \nmay also lessen the risk of complications.19 Drug \ntreatment is, however, costly, of only moderate \neffectiveness and does not improve urodynamic \nstatus. Procedures that reduce prostate bulk \ncombine higher effectiveness with the attraction \nof a single treatment, but they are associated \nwith increasing severity of unwanted effects; \nopen removal of the prostate (prostatectomy), \nfor example, has the greatest effectiveness but \nresults in the highest morbidity. Although still an \noption for larger glands, open prostatectomy is \nnot commonly used for the treatment of BPE in \nthe UK and will not be considered further in this \nreview, which concentrates on newer interventions. \nTURP has been the mainstay of treatment for \nclinical BPE for many years because it combines \nhigh effectiveness with a previously acceptable \nside-effect profile. More recently, in the UK, men \nhave tended to seek help earlier in the natural \nhistory of the disease and access to secondary \nhealth care has improved. This, together with \nincreasing co-morbidities present in the ageing Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n5\npopulation at risk and the desire of health \nproviders to contain costs, has fuelled the search \nfor less morbid invasive treatments. There is also \nsome evidence that men without complications \nor severe symptoms would prefer a less morbid \nmethod of prostate ablation with a shorter \nhospital stay.20 Technological developments have \nallowed clinical investigators and medical device \nmanufacturers to apply alternative energy sources \nwith varying degrees of invasiveness to achieve \nreduction of prostate bulk without some of the side \neffects of TURP, such as bleeding, cardiovascular \ndisturbance due to irrigation, incontinence and \nejaculatory dysfunction. These interventions can be \nsubdivided into surgical procedures that generally \ninvolve removal of prostate tissue requiring \ngeneral or regional anaesthesia and minimally \ninvasive options, which do not require general \nanaesthesia and can be carried out in an outpatient \nsetting.21 The former group are generally more \nefficacious than the latter group but have higher \ncomplication rates; however, estimates of beneficial \nand unwanted effects do vary between procedures \nwithin these two categories.21 \nDescription of new \ninterventions\nIn this section we describe standard and newer \ninterventions that will be compared in the review \nof clinical effectiveness and economic model. The \nUK government-funded health service (NHS) is \nfortunate in having comprehensive centralised \ndata collection systems from which numbers of \nprocedures and their costs can be extracted.22 \nUnfortunately, current coding systems do not \ndifferentiate between energy sources used in \nprostate ablation, with all procedures coded as \nTURP. This makes it difficult to estimate the \nnumber of newer interventions being performed, \nand the occurrence rates for specific procedures \ngiven below should be considered as approximate. \nConsidering the relevant OPCS-4 codes (M65.1, \nM65.2, M65.3, M65.8, M65.9, M66.2, M66.8, \nM66.9, M67.8, M67.9, M70.8), a total of 28,799 \nprocedures were performed within NHS hospitals \nin England during the financial year 2004\u20132005 \n(main operation four-character codes 2004\u20132005), \nwhich tallies well with the count of 30,387 using \nthe simplified Healthcare Resource Group codes \nL27, L28 and L29 (Healthcare Resource Group \ncodes 2004\u20132005).22 Given a total population of 49 \nmillion and a population at risk (men > 59 years) \nof 4.5 million, this gives crude incidence rates of 60 \nper 100,000 per year and 667 per 100,000 per year \nrespectively for surgical treatment of clinical BPE.23 \nTable 1 provides a summary of the main surgical \nprocedures, detailing the main characteristics, \nnumber of operations performed by the NHS in \n2006 and cost.\nMinimally invasive treatments\nIntroduction\nMinimally invasive treatments seek to ablate \nBPE using low-energy heating devices. Typically \ntemperatures of 40\u201380\u00b0C are achieved, causing \nareas of coagulative necrosis, which either slough \nvia the urethra or are reabsorbed during tissue \nrepair. The resultant defect is usually visible on \ntransrectal ultrasound scanning but is considerably \nsmaller than for TURP. Provided energy delivery is \nkept low these treatments can be carried out in the \noffice or outpatient clinic, whereas higher energy \nlevels require anaesthesia and hence an operating \ntheatre. Delayed necrosis means that relatively \nprolonged catheterisation is required to avoid \nurinary retention and painful micturition and, as a \nconsequence, treatment benefit may not be realised \nfor 2\u20133 months.24 The use of urethral stents is also \ndiscussed in this section.\nInterventions\nTransurethral microwave \nthermotherapy\nMicrowave energy is used in transurethral \nmicrowave thermotherapy (TUMT), achieving \ntemperatures of 45\u201370\u00b0C in the prostate \ndepending on the device and power setting. \nInitially, energy was delivered at low power \nsettings but variable higher energy delivery is \nnow more usual. Microwaves induce oscillation \nof water molecules causing heat generation \nand inducing coagulative necrosis of prostatic \ntissue.25 The procedure is typically performed \nusing an antenna mounted within a transurethral \ncatheter through which cooling fluid circulates. \nTemperature control is regulated by urethral \nand rectal thermometer probes to prevent \ncollateral damage. The procedure lasts for 30\u201360 \nminutes and is performed using local anaesthesia \nand oral analgesia together with sedation \nfor high-energy protocols. Requirement for \npostoperative catheterisation varies from 1 to 12 \nweeks depending on the protocol used.26 \nTransurethral needle \nablation of the prostate\nTransurethral needle ablation (TUNA) of the \nprostate involves the delivery of radio frequency \nenergy via a modified urethral catheter attached to Background\n6\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n \n1\n \nC\no\nm\np\na\nr\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nc\nh\na\nr\na\nc\nt\ne\nr\ni\ns\nt\ni\nc\ns\n \no\nf\n \nm\na\ni\nn\n \ns\nu\nr\ng\ni\nc\na\nl\n \nt\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\n \no\np\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n \nf\no\nr\n \nc\nl\ni\nn\ni\nc\na\nl\n \nB\nP\nE\n \nP\nr\no\nc\ne\nd\nu\nr\ne\nH\no\ns\np\ni\nt\na\nl\n \ns\nt\na\ny\nE\nn\ne\nr\ng\ny\n \ns\no\nu\nr\nc\ne\nM\ne\nt\nh\no\nd\n \no\nf\n \nt\ni\ns\ns\nu\ne\n \nr\ne\nm\no\nv\na\nl\nP\ne\nr\ni\no\nd\n \no\nf\n \nc\na\nt\nh\ne\nt\ne\nr\ni\ns\na\nt\ni\no\nn\nN\nH\nS\n \np\nr\no\nc\ne\nd\nu\nr\ne\ns\n \n(\np\ne\nr\n \ny\ne\na\nr\n)\na\nC\no\ns\nt\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\nb\nM\ni\nn\ni\nm\na\nl\nl\ny\n \ni\nn\nv\na\ns\ni\nv\ne\nT\nU\nM\nT\nD\na\ny\n \nc\na\ns\ne\nM\ni\nc\nr\no\nw\na\nv\ne\nC\no\na\ng\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nn\ne\nc\nr\no\ns\ni\ns\n1\n\u2013\n2\n \nw\ne\ne\nk\ns\n3\n0\n0\n1\n8\n0\n0\nT\nU\nN\nA\nD\na\ny\n \nc\na\ns\ne\nR\na\nd\ni\no\n \nf\nr\ne\nq\nu\ne\nn\nc\ny\nC\no\na\ng\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nn\ne\nc\nr\no\ns\ni\ns\n3\n \nd\na\ny\ns\n1\n0\n0\n1\n6\n0\n0\nH\nI\nF\nU\nD\na\ny\n \nc\na\ns\ne\nU\nl\nt\nr\na\ns\no\nu\nn\nd\nC\no\na\ng\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nn\ne\nc\nr\no\ns\ni\ns\n2\n \nw\ne\ne\nk\ns\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\nL\na\ns\ne\nr\n \nc\no\na\ng\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n1\n\u2013\n2\n \nd\na\ny\ns\nL\na\ns\ne\nr\nC\no\na\ng\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \nn\ne\nc\nr\no\ns\ni\ns\n3\n\u2013\n7\n \nd\na\ny\ns\n5\n0\n0\n7\n5\n0\nA\nb\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\nT\nU\nI\nP\n1\n\u2013\n2\n \nd\na\ny\ns\nD\ni\na\nt\nh\ne\nr\nm\ny\nN\no\nn\ne\n1\n\u2013\n2\n \nd\na\ny\ns\n2\n5\n0\n0\n1\n8\n0\n0\nT\nU\nR\nP\n3\n\u2013\n5\n \nd\na\ny\ns\nD\ni\na\nt\nh\ne\nr\nm\ny\nR\ne\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n1\n\u2013\n3\n \nd\na\ny\ns\n2\n0\n,\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\nL\na\ns\ne\nr\n \nv\na\np\no\nr\ni\ns\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n1\n\u2013\n2\n \nd\na\ny\ns\nL\na\ns\ne\nr\nV\na\np\no\nr\ni\ns\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n1\n\u2013\n2\n \nd\na\ny\ns\n3\n0\n0\n0\n2\n6\n0\n0\nT\nU\nV\nP\n2\n\u2013\n3\n \nd\na\ny\ns\nD\ni\na\nt\nh\ne\nr\nm\ny\nV\na\np\no\nr\ni\ns\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n1\n\u2013\n2\n \nd\na\ny\ns\n2\n0\n0\n0\n1\n8\n0\n0\nH\no\nL\nE\nP\n2\n\u2013\n3\n \nd\na\ny\ns\nL\na\ns\ne\nr\nE\nn\nu\nc\nl\ne\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n1\n\u2013\n2\n \nd\na\ny\ns\n1\n5\n0\n0\n1\n9\n0\n0\nH\nI\nF\nU\n,\n \nh\ni\ng\nh\n-\ni\nn\nt\ne\nn\ns\ni\nt\ny\n \nf\no\nc\nu\ns\ne\nd\n \nu\nl\nt\nr\na\ns\no\nu\nn\nd\n \n;\n \nH\no\nL\nE\nP\n,\n \nh\no\nl\nm\ni\nu\nm\n \nl\na\ns\ne\nr\n \ne\nn\nu\nc\nl\ne\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \no\nf\n \nt\nh\ne\n \np\nr\no\ns\nt\na\nt\ne\n \n;\n \nT\nU\nI\nP\n,\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nu\nr\ne\nt\nh\nr\na\nl\n \ni\nn\nc\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\n \no\nf\n \nt\nh\ne\n \np\nr\no\ns\nt\na\nt\ne\n;\n \nT\nU\nM\nT\n,\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nu\nr\ne\nt\nh\nr\na\nl\n \nm\ni\nc\nr\no\nw\na\nv\ne\n \nt\nh\ne\nr\nm\no\nt\nh\ne\nr\na\np\ny\n;\n \nT\nU\nN\nA\n,\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nu\nr\ne\nt\nh\nr\na\nl\n \nn\ne\ne\nd\nl\ne\n \na\nb\nl\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n;\n \nT\nU\nR\nP\n,\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nu\nr\ne\nt\nh\nr\na\nl\n \nr\ne\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n \no\nf\n \nt\nh\ne\n \np\nr\no\ns\nt\na\nt\ne\n;\n \nT\nU\nV\nP\n,\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nu\nr\ne\nt\nh\nr\na\nl\n \nv\na\np\no\nr\ni\ns\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \no\nf\n \nt\nh\ne\n \np\nr\no\ns\nt\na\nt\ne\n.\na\n \nE\ns\nt\ni\nm\na\nt\ne\nd\n \nf\nr\no\nm\n \na\n \nt\no\nt\na\nl\n \no\nf\n \n3\n0\n,\n0\n0\n0\n \np\nr\no\nc\ne\nd\nu\nr\ne\ns\n \nf\nr\no\nm\n \nh\no\ns\np\ni\nt\na\nl\n \ne\np\ni\ns\no\nd\ne\n \ns\nt\na\nt\ni\ns\nt\ni\nc\ns\n \nd\na\nt\na\n \n(\nN\nH\nS\n \nH\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n \na\nn\nd\n \nS\no\nc\ni\na\nl\n \nC\na\nr\ne\n \nI\nn\nf\no\nr\nm\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nC\ne\nn\nt\nr\ne\n,\n \n2\n0\n0\n6\n)\n.\n2\n2\nb\n \nE\ns\nt\ni\nm\na\nt\ne\nd\n \nf\nr\no\nm\n \nN\nH\nS\n \na\nn\nd\n \nm\na\nn\nu\nf\na\nc\nt\nu\nr\ne\nr\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n \nd\na\nt\na\n.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The radio frequency waves generate ionic \nagitation of molecules within the prostate, which \nin turn produces a localised heating effect of up \nto 115\u00b0C resulting in areas of coagulative necrosis. \nTeflon sheaths are advanced over the needles \nfollowing placement to a depth of 5\u20136 mm to \nprotect the urethra. The radio frequency power \nis usually delivered at 2\u201315 W for 5 minutes per \nlesion.27 Once the coagulative effect has been \nachieved the needles are placed in a different \narea of the prostate and the procedure repeated. \nDepending on prostate size, the procedure \ngenerally lasts between 30 and 60 minutes and is \nperformed under local or regional anaesthesia.28 \nAn indwelling catheter is placed for up to 3 days \nand antibiotic therapy given.29\nUrethral stent\nThe rationale for stenting of the prostatic urethra \nin men with BPE is to nullify the compressive and \nconstrictive obstructive effect of the adenomatous \ntissue and hence reduce the bladder pressure \nrequired to open the urethra.30 The currently \navailable device is made of woven braided wire \nmesh that can be delivered and expanded in the \nprostatic urethra under endoscopic or radiological \ncontrol. The proximal end is engaged in the \nbladder neck and the distal end must lie above \nthe external sphincter to prevent incontinence. \nThe procedure can be accomplished using local \nanaesthesia. The inner aspect of the stent becomes \nlined with epithelium over a 3- to 12-week period. \nUnfortunately, device migration, ingrowth of \nfibrous stroma and encrustation are common \nlonger-term sequelae leading to explantation in up \nto 50% of cases.\nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound\nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) uses \nultrasound as the energy source, which, when \ntightly focused, can cause coagulative necrosis \nof tissue. It is delivered by a transrectal probe \nequipped with a transducer incorporating both \nimaging and ablative capabilities on the same \nceramic crystal operating at 4 MHz. Ultrasound \ncan be delivered to a precisely located focal zone of \n2 \u00d7 10 mm leading to a rapid rise in temperature \nof up to 80\u2013100\u00b0C using short exposure duration. \nMultiple lesions are then created throughout the \nprostate by moving the probe, with a treatment \nsession lasting about 60 minutes. A catheter \nis placed to drain the bladder throughout \nthe procedure and remains in place for about \n2 weeks.31,32 The high temperatures achieved \nnecessitate general anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia \nwith the procedure carried out as a day case.\nTransurethral ethanol \nablation of the prostate\nTransurethral ethanol ablation of the prostate \n(TEAP) is chemical ablation of prostatic tissue \nusing dehydrated ethanol. This results in the \ndevelopment of intraprostatic necrotic areas due to \ndehydration, protein degeneration and thrombotic \nclosure of arterioles and venules.33 Delivery of \nabsolute ethanol into the prostate can be achieved \nby injection via a transperineal,34 transrectal35 \nor transurethral36 route. The transurethral route \nis the most commonly reported delivery route. \nCommercially available 0.5\u20132.0 ml injection of \nethanol (99.5% v\/v) is injected into the prostate \nusing either an injection and aspiration set for \nperiurethral injection (Richard Wolf GmbH, \nKnittlingen, Germany) or a cystourethroscopy \ninjection system (Olympus Winter & Ibe GmbH, \nHamburg, Germany). The sites of injection are \nabout halfway between the bladder neck and \nthe verumontanum at the 2, 4, 8 and 10 o\u2019clock \npositions, at least 1.5 cm proximal to the external \nsphincter. The number of injections depends upon \nthe size of the prostate gland. The requirement \nfor postoperative catheterisation is longer than \nin standard TURP and the retreatment rates are \nhigher.37 There are no long-term outcome or cost-\neffectiveness reports. \nWater-induced thermotherapy\nWater-induced thermotherapy (WIT) destroys \nprostate tissue by way of heat energy delivered by \nhot water flowing through a urethral catheter made \nup of four contiguous sections \u2013 a urine drainage \nlumen, a positioning balloon, a treatment balloon \nand an insulated shaft.38 The catheter is inserted \ninto the urinary bladder and secured by inflating \nthe positioning balloon. Hot water circulates \nthrough the treatment balloon, which lies in the \nprostatic urethra, and is precisely maintained \nat 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F) by thermocouples located in \nthe catheter and machine. The procedure takes \napproximately 45 minutes under local anaesthesia \nand analgesia. The treatment catheter is removed \nand replaced by a standard urethral drainage \ncatheter, which remains for 4\u201317 days.39 \nTransurethral laser coagulation \nof the prostate\nLaser-induced coagulative necrosis of the \nprostatic tissue can be achieved either by surface \napplication to the prostatic urethra in a technique Background\n8\ntermed visual laser ablation of the prostate \n(VLAP) or by inserting specially designed fibres \ninto the prostatic tissue via the urethra, termed \ninterstitial laser coagulation (ILC). VLAP uses a \nneodynium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) \nlaser to create areas of coagulative necrosis \nextending out from the prostatic urethra. This laser \nhas a unique wavelength of 1064 nm and penetrates \ntissue for up to 1.7 cm leading to delayed necrosis \nand sloughing of tissue into the urethra over a \nperiod of 6\u20138 weeks. For ILC, a diode laser is \ntransmitted through a fine fibre, which is inserted \ninto the prostate under endoscopic control to a \ndepth of 1 cm to create 3 cm3 lesions within 2\u20133 \nminutes at a temperature of 85\u00b0C. Typically, up to \nten locations can be treated, with the procedure \nlasting for 30\u201360 minutes under local anaesthesia. \nCatheterisation is typically required for between 3 \nand 7 days.40 \nIdentification of patient subgroups \nand criteria for treatment\nThe one-off outpatient nature of minimally invasive \ntherapy makes it an attractive option for men \nwith moderate to severe LUTS who do not wish \nto have long-term medical treatment or who are \nconcerned about the side effects of more invasive \ntreatments. The reduced need for anaesthesia \nand lower morbidity make it suitable for men with \nextensive co-morbidity.27 These procedures are \ngenerally not suitable for men with larger prostates \n(> 50 g) because of prolonged treatment time and \nhigh rates of post-treatment dysuria and urinary \nretention. In addition, they are not indicated for \nmen with absolute indications for prostate surgery \nsuch as urinary retention, bleeding and recurrent \nurinary infection. The use of stents is restricted \nto men with urinary retention with extensive \nco-morbidity, which precludes prostate ablation \ntechniques.\nPersonnel involved\nMost of these treatments can be performed by a \nsingle physician, typically a urologist, in an office or \nclinic setting. The physician should have expertise \nin both the technique and the administration \nof local anaesthetic. A nurse assistant is also \nrequired together with appropriate reception and \nadministration staff. Removal of the catheter can \nbe performed at a subsequent office visit or by a \ncommunity nurse. \nSetting\nThese technologies are suitable for use in the \noffice, clinic or ambulatory care facility with a \ntypical stay of approximately 4\u20138 hours. For \nprocedures performed under local anaesthetic a \nwell-equipped clinic room with basic resuscitation \nfacilities, appropriate utility supply and recovery \narea are all that are required; however, for some \nprocedures a standard operating theatre set-up \nwith anaesthetic support is required. High capital \ncosts and concerns regarding effectiveness have led \nto low use of these procedures in the UK, with only \na few centres using the technology. It is estimated \nthat fewer than 1000 procedures in total are carried \nout per year, representing less than 4% of the total. \nEquipment\nIn general, these technologies require a generator \nand a delivery device, which is typically a single-\nuse modified urethral catheter. In addition, \nsome require cooling circuits, endoscopic \npositioning and transrectal imaging for device \nplacement and monitoring of effect. Drugs and \ndelivery equipment for local anaesthesia and \nsedation are also required. Patients are generally \ndischarged home shortly after completion of the \nprocedure with an indwelling catheter. Different \nmanufacturers offer competing devices, which \ndiffer mainly in power output and delivery system. \nFor TUMT the main devices are Prolieve\u2122 (Boston \nScientific, USA), CoreTherm\u2122 (Prostalund, \nSweden), TherMatrx\u00ae (American Medical System, \nUSA), and Prostatron\u00ae and Targis\u2122 (Urologix, \nUSA). TUNA is provided by Prostiva\u2122 (Medtronic, \nUSA), WIT by AquaTherm\u2122 (WIT) (ACMI, USA) \nand HIFU by Sonablate\u00ae 500 (Focus Surgery, USA). \nThe currently available interstitial laser device is \nIndigo Optimax (Indigo LaserOptic\u2122(Johnson & \nJohnson, USA).40,41 The available prostatic stent is \nmarketed as Urolume\u00ae (American Medical System, \nUSA).\nCosts\nThe cost of a TUMT generator is approximately \n\u00a314,000, with an additional cost of disposables of \napproximately \u00a3350 per case (Urologix, USA). The \nTUNA machine costs \u00a35750 with an additional cost \nof \u00a3700 for the disposable cartridge (Medtronic, \nUK). The purchase cost of the Sonablate 500 HIFU \nsystem is around \u00a3300,000 (UK HIFU). Urolume \nstents cost \u00a31365 (American Medical System, UK). \nThe remaining devices are not marketed in the UK.\nTransurethral resection of \nthe prostate (TURP)\nIntroduction\nTURP has been the standard method of surgical \nmanagement of clinical BPE for 50 years and in \nrecent times has accounted for more than 90% of Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n9\nprostatectomies performed for this indication,42 \nalthough in current practice this has been \nreduced to 60\u201380% by the advent of other ablative \nprocedures detailed below.42 The technology \nuses diathermy current for prostate resection \nvia a loop electrode using a continuous flow \nendoscope passed down the urethra with non-ionic \nfluid irrigant, usually 1.5% glycine. Coagulative \nhaemostasis is achieved during and at the end of \nthe procedure with a ball diathermy electrode. For \nmost men a skilled urologist can achieve complete \nresection of up to 100 g of tissue within 1 hour. \nImprovements in endoscope design, diathermy \nunits and bladder irrigation have reduced both \noperating time and risk of major morbidity. \nPostoperatively the bladder is irrigated for 6\u201324 \nhours; the catheter is removed at 24\u201348 hours after \nsurgery before discharge home.43\nIdentification of patient subgroups\nTURP is a versatile technique that can achieve \neffective relief for men with bothersome moderate \nor severe symptoms. It is also highly effective \nat treating other manifestations of BPE such \nas urinary retention, recurrent infection and \nhaematuria. Blood loss and absorption of irrigant \nfluids are the main causes of operative morbidity, \nparticularly in men with clotting disorders, those \ntaking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication \nand those with significant cardiovascular morbidity. \nSafety can be improved by use of preoperative \ndrug treatment aimed at reducing both the size of \nthe prostate and bleeding during the procedure \nand use of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. \nImprovements in spinal anaesthesia and better \nvideoendoscopic equipment have resulted in \nshorter operation times, and more aggressive \ncatheter removal policies have shortened hospital \nstay.44\nPersonnel involved\nTURP requires full operating room facilities with \na urologist, scrub and circulating nurses and an \nanaesthetist. Standard inpatient pathways with \nexperienced ward and recovery room staff and \nporters are also required. \nSetting\nTraditionally TURP was considered an inpatient \nprocedure requiring admission the day before \nsurgery and a 4-day postoperative stay in a \nurology hospital ward. In the UK, the last 1\u20132 \nyears have seen the development of managed care \npathways and a drive towards shortened hospital \nstay, stimulated partly by competing techniques \nand partly by cost containment and avoidance of \nhospital-related morbidity. This has meant that \nstay for straightforward TURP has been shortened \nto 2\u20133 days with discharge the morning following \nmidnight catheter removal.44 \nEquipment\nA standard diathermy generator is required \nwith cutting and coagulation outputs. The \nvideoendoscopic equipment is also standardised \nwith, typically, a 26Fr sheath, operating element, \n30\u00b0 telescope, xenon light source and \u2018two-chip\u2019 \ncamera with appropriate monitor.\nCosts\nMultiple manufacturers compete for this market, \nwhich tends to keep actual purchase costs \nlow although list prices are high. Most of the \nequipment would be considered standard operating \ndepartment stock with multifunctionality for use \nin open surgery, endourology and laparoscopic \nsurgery. Within the NHS the procedure has unique \nHealthcare Resource Group codes, L27 for men \naged over 69 years and L28 for men aged under \n70 years, with mean costs (2004\u20132005) set by \nproviders of \u00a32060 (interquartile range \u00a31715\u2013\n2429) and \u00a31864 (interquartile range \u00a31547\u20132198) \nrespectively.45\nTransurethral incision \nof the prostate\nEndoscopic incision of the prostate from bladder \nneck to verumontanum at the 7 o\u2019clock position \nusing cutting diathermy via a standard resectoscope \nis a relatively simple technique that is claimed to \nhave short-term equivalence in effectiveness to \nTURP for men with smaller prostates (< 30 g).46,47 \nThe advantages of transurethral incision of the \nprostate (TUIP) are reduced bleeding with no \nneed for postoperative irrigation and shortened \ncatheterisation time together with a lower risk \nof developing retrograde ejaculation.47 The \ndisadvantage is that no prostatic tissue is removed \nleading to a high rate of symptom recurrence and \nneed for further surgery.43 \nPatient selection, personnel required, setting, \nequipment and costs are similar to those for \nTURP.24,45 TUIP has a specific OPCS-4 code \n(M66.2) and data from the NHS suggest that \n2464 procedures were carried out in England \nduring 2005, representing 8.5% of the total (main \noperation four-character codes 2004\u20132005).22 Background\n10\nOther tissue ablative techniques\nVaporisation of the prostate\nIntroduction\nVaporisation of tissue requires rapid localised \nheating to temperatures of 100\u00b0C or more with \nminimal depth of penetration. The anatomy of \nthe prostate and in particular the development of \nhyperplasia within the inner periurethral zones \nof the gland mean that transurethral delivery \nof energy for vaporisation is both feasible and \ndesirable. At present two alternative sources of \nenergy are available for transurethral vaporisation \nof the prostate (TUVP): laser and electrosurgical.48\nInterventions using laser technology\nTransurethral laser vaporisation of the prostate\nBasic research has enabled the identification of \nlasers with source, wavelength and absorption \ncharacteristics suitable for rapid heating with \nminimal tissue penetration that could be delivered \nby the transurethral route and cause vaporisation \non contact with the prostate.49 Initially, Nd:YAG \nwas used at a power setting of 40 W.50 This had a \ndisadvantage for vaporisation purposes of relatively \ndeep tissue penetration (4\u201318 mm) related to low \nabsorption and a wavelength of 1064 nm in the \ninvisible spectrum.51 These characteristics were \nimproved by passing the Nd:YAG-generated beam \nthrough a potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) \ncrystal, which doubles the frequency and halves the \nwavelength. By doing so, the light becomes visible \nin the green spectrum (532 nm), which encourages \nabsorption by haemoglobin52 and results in a depth \nof penetration ranging from 0.8 to 3 mm.49 In \na highly vascular tissue such as BPE, this results \nin a high energy density and rapid vaporisation, \nwhich is further improved by the higher power \nsource (80 W) that is currently available for this \ntechnology.51 The holmium laser can also be \nused for transurethral prostate vaporisation by \ndelivering energy at a wavelength of 2140 nm.53 \nThis laser has limited tissue penetration (0.4 mm), \naffords excellent haemostasis and is preferentially \nabsorbed by water, enhancing the effectiveness of \ntissue ablation. Initially, moderate power (60 W) was \nused but this has now been increased to 80\u2013100 W \nto improve efficiency.49 Contact laser vaporisation \nis performed using an irrigating cystoscope but \nstill requires similar anaesthesia and operating \nconditions to TURP, with the operating time \nincreased by a factor of approximately 1.5.54\nInterventions using non-\nlaser technology\nTransurethral electrovaporisation of the prostate\nThis technique utilises a standard monopolar \nelectrodiathermy device to deliver sufficient power, \ntypically 180\u2013300 W on the \u2018cut\u2019 setting, to vaporise \ntissue on contact. The procedure is performed \nusing an irrigating sheath and telescope passed \nalong the urethra, which allows continuous flow \nof a non-ionic solution such as 1.5% glycine to \nmaintain a clear view. The current is delivered \nthrough a grooved ball or modified loop electrode \ngiving a depth of penetration of 1\u20133 mm.55,56 \nThe procedure is similar to TURP in terms of \nrequirement for spinal or general anaesthesia, \noperating time and aftercare.55,57 More recently, \nfurther modification has allowed the use of bipolar \ncurrent, which enables the use of physiological \nsaline as a safer irrigant with tissue effects \noccurring at lower temperatures (ranging from \n40\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C) than with monopolar electrosurgery \n(300\u2013400\u00b0C).58,59\nIdentification of patient subgroups \nand criteria for treatment\nThe requirement for general anaesthesia and \nstandard operating room conditions and the \ndegree of invasiveness mean that indications for \nvaporisation surgery in terms of symptom severity, \nsymptom bother and degree of co-morbidity are \nsimilar to those for TURP. The simultaneous \nhaemostatic coagulating effect of vaporisation \ntechniques suggests additional usefulness for men \non long-term anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy \nwho may have been previously advised against \nTURP.60 The increased operating time compared \nwith resection procedures, however, suggests \nthat these techniques are most suited to small or \nmedium-sized prostates up to approximately 60 ml. \nThe lack of tissue samples means that prostate \ncancer should be excluded when necessary by \npreoperative investigation.\nPersonnel involved\nVaporisation of the prostate requires standard \noperating room preparation and facilities. Patients \nwill be admitted to a hospital bed or ambulatory \ncare facility and prepared for surgery by nursing \nand ancillary staff with preceding anaesthetic \nassessment. On transfer to the operating room, \nthe anaesthetist and assistant will administer the \nappropriate anaesthetic.

Following completion, the patient \nis transferred to a staffed recovery room and then \nback to the ward setting to complete the hospital \nstay, which is typically 2 days. If discharged with \nan indwelling catheter this will require planned \nremoval by a hospital or community-based nurse. \nSetting\nIn the UK the procedure will be carried out \nthrough an inpatient urology unit, typically with \nday of surgery admission and subsequent single \novernight stay. Some units have set up US-style \nambulatory care facilities to restrict the hospital \nstay to less than 24 hours if clinically and socially \nappropriate. It is difficult to give precise figures \nconcerning the number of such procedures \nperformed under the NHS because of imprecise \ncoding but it is likely to be fewer than 5000, \nrepresenting less than 17% of the total. \nEquipment\nFor electrovaporisation, the only equipment that \nis required in addition to that used for TURP \nis the modified ball or loop electrode, which is \ncurrently designed for single patient use. For \nlaser vaporisation, a source generator is required \ntogether with laser fibres, which are generally \nsingle patient use, and protective eyewear.\nCosts\nIn comparison with TURP, electrovaporisation \nrequires a more expensive modified electrode \n(Gyrus, UK), typically three times the cost of the \nstandard loop and ball electrode (\u00a340) used for \nTURP. The major cost for laser vaporisation is the \ncapital purchase of the source generator, which \nranges from \u00a390,000 for the KTP laser (Laserscope, \nCwmbran, UK) to \u00a3120,000 for the holmium \nlaser (Sigmacon, Stanmore, UK), together with \nsingle-use fibre costs of \u00a3750 and \u00a3550 per patient \nrespectively. The main cost saving (and associated \ngain in benefits) is reduced requirement for blood \ntransfusion. With modern care pathways, hospital \nstay is likely to be 1 day less than for TURP.\nResection of the prostate\nIntroduction\nThese techniques seek to create a similar tissue \nablative effect to TURP but with reduced bleeding \nand fluid absorption leading to lower perioperative \nmorbidity. Modified irrigating cystoscopes or \nresectoscopes are used and the prostate is removed \npiecemeal as in TURP allowing subsequent \nhistological examination. At present this can \npotentially be achieved either by holmium:YAG \nlaser resection or by bipolar electroresection using \nnormal saline. \nInterventions using laser technology\nHolmium:YAG laser prostatectomy \nHolmium laser prostatectomy used to be \nperformed by resection of small pieces of prostate \ntissue down to the prostate capsule (HoLRP); \nhowever, this technique has largely been \nsuperseded by holmium laser enucleation of the \nprostate lobes (HoLEP). HoLEP uses the laser to \ndissect in the surgical planes and is conceptually \nthe endoscopic equivalent of open prostatectomy. \nIn this technique the holmium laser is used at \na high power setting of 60\u201380 W with an end-\nfiring fibre61. The procedure is performed using a \ncontinuous flow resectoscope with a video system \nand saline irrigation to maintain a clear view. The \nlaser fibre is passed through a stabilising catheter \nwith 5\u201310 cm of cladding stripped off at the distal \nend. Typically, the laser is set at an energy of 2 J \nand a frequency of 50 Hz, with minor variations \ndepending on the preference of the surgeon. The \nprocedure starts with bladder neck incisions at \n5 and 7 o\u2019clock to define surgical margins. The \nmedian and lateral lobes are then undermined and \nresected off the prostatic capsule in a retrograde \ndirection until the bladder neck is reached. \nThe resected lobes are pushed into the bladder, \nmorcellated and removed. The procedure can be \ncarried out under spinal or general anaesthesia, \nwith slightly longer operating times than for TURP \nbut with similar postoperative care.51,62\u201364 \nInterventions using non-\nlaser technology\nBipolar resection of the prostate\nThe technique of bipolar electroresection requires \na diathermy generator (200 W capability, a radio \nfrequency range of 320\u2013450 kHz and a voltage \nrange of 254\u2013350 V) and a cutting loop that is \nsimilar to a monopolar loop in shape but which \nhas the active and return electrode on the same \naxis separated by a ceramic insulator. A chip in \nthe loop automatically adjusts the power setting of \nthe generator for the best cutting and coagulating \nparameters.65 The underlying principle of this \ntechnique is the conversion of conductive solution \ninto vapour (plasma) containing energy-charged \nparticles that cause molecular dissociation of \ntissues. The electric arc (charged particles) takes \nthe path of least resistance, the saline irrigant, \nthus controlling temperatures at the treatment site \nand reducing the risk of thermal damage to the \nsurrounding tissue.58,66 The procedure is performed \nusing a continuous flow resectoscope with saline Background\n12\nirrigation reducing the risks of fluid absorption \nand blood loss.67\nTransurethral vaporesection of the prostate\nTransurethral vaporesection of the prostate \n(TUVRP) involves simultaneous resection and \nvaporisation with coagulation of prostatic tissue. \nThe main differences between standard TURP \nand TUVRP are in the design of the loop and \nthe level of electroenergy used. In TUVRP, a \nthick band-like loop is coupled with a high \nelectrosurgery cutting energy. The perceived \nadvantages of TUVRP are shorter duration of \ncatheterisation and hospital stay, less blood loss, \nbetter visualisation during resection and reduced \nelectrolyte disturbances.68 The main disadvantage \nof TUVRP is longer duration of the procedure \nbecause of slower passage of the band electrode to \nallow for maximum coagulation and desiccation \nof the prostatic tissue, which remain central to this \ntechnique.\nIdentification of patient subgroups \nand criteria for treatment\nThe selection of patients, preoperative \nworkup, informed consent, type of anaesthesia, \npostoperative care and clinical follow-up are \nsimilar to those of TURP. If appropriate, prostate \ncancer should be excluded by biopsy before \nproceeding with HoLEP.69 Improved haemostasis \nwith these techniques encourages their use for \nmen with clotting abnormalities or those taking \nanticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs. There is \nsome suggestion that this procedure is suitable \nfor prostate enlargement of any size.51,64 A long \nlearning curve and 20\u201330% longer operative time \nthan for standard TURP mean that increased \nsurgeon expertise and operating room availability \nare required.70,71 \nPersonnel involved\nResection of the prostate requires standard \noperating room preparation and facilities. \nProtective eyewear is worn by surgeons, theatre \npersonnel and patients to avoid eye damage from \nthe laser. Before carrying out the procedures \nthe laser machine is checked by trained theatre \npersonnel according to the manufacturer\u2019s \ninstructions. Patients will be admitted to a hospital \nbed or ambulatory care facility and prepared \nfor theatre by nursing and ancillary staff with \npreceding anaesthetic assessment. On transfer to \nthe operating room, the anaesthetist and assistant \nwill administer the appropriate anaesthetic. The \nurologist carries out the surgery supported by a \nscrub nurse and two circulating nurses. It is difficult \nto define how many procedures a surgeon must \nperform to become competent but it is generally \nagreed that about 30 cases are required for a \nurologist familiar with transurethral surgery to feel \nreasonably safe performing the HoLEP technique. \nFollowing completion, the patient is transferred \nto the staffed recovery room and then back to the \nward setting to complete the hospital stay, which is \ntypically 2\u20133 days. If discharged with an indwelling \ncatheter this will require planned removal by a \nhospital or community-based nurse. \nSetting\nIn the UK, laser resection and transurethral \nresection (in normal saline) procedures will be \ncarried out through an inpatient urology unit, \ntypically with day of surgery admission and \nsubsequent single overnight stay. Some units have \nset up US-style ambulatory care facilities to restrict \nhospital stay to less than 24 hours if clinically and \nsocially appropriate. It is unclear how many of \nthese procedures are performed in the UK but it is \nlikely to be fewer than 2500 per year, representing \nless than 9% of the total.\nEquipment\nFor laser resection of the prostate using \nholmium:YAG lasers, in addition to a high-power \nmachine (100 W VersaPulse; Lumenis, USA), a \n550-\u03bcm end-firing fibre, 6Fr ureteric catheter, \nmorcellator and eyewear are required. The \nresection is performed using a 27Fr continuous \nflow resectoscope with a modified inner sheath for \nthe laser fibre channel. The irrigating solution is \n0.9% saline.61,72 For bipolar resection in saline, a \nsource generator and bipolar resection system with \nspecial cutting loops are required (Gyrus, USA).65,67 \nCosts\nA HoLEP generator costs approximately \u00a3120,000, \nthe tissue morcellator \u00a320,000, laser fibre \u00a3550 \nand the morcellator blade \u00a3440.51 However, a \nholmium:YAG laser can be efficiently used as a \nmultifunctional endourological energy source \nin management of other conditions such as \nurinary stone disease, and the laser fibres and \nmorcellator blades are designed for multipatient \nuse. The main cost saving (and associated gain \nin benefits) is the reduced requirement for blood \ntransfusion, possible shorter hospital stay and lower \nrequirement for continuous postoperative irrigants.

A number of \nmeetings were held between the clinical members \nof the research team to consider the likely place \nand use of each treatment modality in plausible \nstrategies of management of BPE. These were then \nchecked with colleagues within their respective \nurology units. Given funding constraints, formal \nconsensus-building approaches such as the Delphi \ntechnique were not used. We first categorised \ntreatments as being minimally invasive, typified by \nambulatory care, reduced anaesthetic requirement \nand no tissue removal; tissue ablative, signifying \nthe use of differing energy sources to remove \nprostate tissue; or standard, indicating TURP or \nTUIP. Again, using clinical consensus we defined \nplausible treatment sequences taking into account \ntreatment mechanism and effect on the remaining \nprostate tissue. We similarly placed limits on the \nnumber of retreatments allowed based on current \nconcepts of the use and effect of the differing \nprocedures. \nFigure 1 details plausible options of care \ninformed by current clinical practice for a \npatient with BPE wanting surgery after a trial \nof drug therapy because the treatment has not \nresulted in symptomatic benefit or as a result \nof disease progression after initial benefit from \ndrug treatment. The patient could be offered a \nminimally invasive intervention and if this results \nin symptomatic benefit no further treatment may \nbe necessary. Should there be inadequate benefit \nor disease progression after initial benefit, the \npatient may be offered a choice of four other \ntreatment options (drug therapy, repeat of \nminimally invasive intervention, a TURP or one \nof the other tissue ablative interventions such as \nKTP laser or TUVP). Should the patient have \ninadequate benefit or further disease progression \nafter a second minimally invasive intervention, it \nwas felt that the most plausible treatment option \nwould be either a TURP or one of the other tissue \nablative interventions. An alternative care pathway \nfor a patient with BPE wanting surgery after a trial \nD\nuring the first half of the last century open \nprostatectomy was the only treatment option \nfor BPE and because of significant mortality it was \nreserved for men with life-threatening problems \nsuch as urinary retention. The 1960s saw the \nadvent of endoscopic transurethral techniques, \nparticularly TURP, which allowed much safer \nsurgery and widened treatment indications to \ninclude men with troublesome symptoms. Further \nimprovements in perioperative care made TURP \none of the most frequently performed operations \ntowards the end of the twentieth century, \nparticularly in the USA. Recent years have seen the \nincreased use of drugs that can improve symptoms \nand possibly slow progression,19,73 which has led to \na decreased rate of surgical intervention, this being \nreserved for those who fail drug treatment or suffer \ncomplications. \nThe treatment strategy of reassurance followed \nby drugs followed by surgery is now standard \nin clinical practice and has been explored in \nprevious reviews of cost-effectiveness.74 A parallel \ndevelopment has been the trial of differing energy \ndelivery technologies to achieve varying degrees \nof surgical prostate tissue ablation, with the aim \nof high efficacy and low morbidity to challenge \nthe standard of TURP. In this field there have \nbeen many false dawns, with technologies being \nintroduced in a haphazard and uncontrolled \nmanner and then being abandoned, as the hoped-\nfor advantages over TURP have not been realised. \nIn the last few years, however, the application of \nrandomised controlled trial (RCT) methodology to \nsurgical treatments has stimulated a more evidence-\nbased approach, partly driven by tighter regulatory \nrequirements. \nOne deficiency of the current evidence, however, \nis the assumption that surgical treatment of \nBPE involves a single treatment over a patient\u2019s \nlifetime. This head-to-head comparative approach \ndoes not take into account the balance between \nshort- or long-term effectiveness on one hand and \nmorbidity and economic costs on the other, which \ndiffers between treatments, nor does it cater for \nthe continued progression of the disease, which \nfrequently results in the need for retreatment.

Should there be inadequate benefit or \ndisease progression after initial benefit, the patient \nmay be offered a choice of another tissue ablative \nintervention or a TURP.

If, on the other hand, a patient with \nBPE wanting surgery after a trial of drug therapy \nchooses to have the gold standard, TURP, then the \nonly option allowed for in the care pathway should \nthere be inadequate benefit or disease progression \nis a repeat TURP. Based on current clinical \npractice, a repeat TURP would usually be carried \nout only after reinvestigation, usually in the form of \nurodynamic assessment.

Economic evaluation \ninvolves the comparison of cost and benefit for \nany technology change and thus provides a means \nof informing decisions about which technology is \nbest.75\nIn this study the comparison between the different \nstrategies depicted in the care pathways (see \nFigure 1) is made using a decision-analytic model \n(DAM).75 The DAM is intended to show, first, the \nconsequences in terms of costs and effects of each \ntechnology for the given population. These data \nare then used to inform the decision as to which \ntechnology or, when there is sufficient doubt, which \ntechnologies are the best, given current belief \ninformed by evidence and judgement. Second, the \nDAM, in accounting for uncertainty, can be used \nto provide information about the likely value of \nconducting future research (evidence gathering) to \nreduce the uncertainty surrounding the decision \nabout which technology or technologies are best.75\nSensitivity analysis might be used to show the effect \non the results of the model of plausible variation in \nmodel structure or parameter values. Deterministic \nsensitivity analysis seeks to identify what change in \na parameter value is required to produce a decision \nchange. However, to account for parameter \nuncertainty with many parameters, each of which \ncould have many values, it can be very difficult \nto interpret such thresholds. A solution is to use \nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis.76 Probabilistic \nsensitivity analysis can also be used to estimate the \nvalue of information (VOI), which can be used to \ninform decisions about further research (details of \nthis method are available elsewhere76,77).\nHow such an economic evaluation of alternative \nsurgical treatments for BPE might be conducted \ncan be informed by a review of the existing \nliterature. The purpose of the review was, first, to \nshow the extent and results of current literature \nand, second, via a critique, to learn lessons in \norder to conduct the most appropriate economic \nevaluation to aid decision-making.\nThe following is a list of the information \nrequirements for all DAMs:\nthe population \u2022\t\nthe technologies to compare \u2022\t\nthe epidemiology: model structure  \u2022\t\n(relationship between parameters)\nthe epidemiology: parameterisation of the  \u2022\t\nmodel (effectiveness, complications, utilities \nand costs)\nsensitivity analysis. \u2022\t\nThis list of requirements will form the framework \nused in this chapter to critique existing models \nand then in Chapter 11 the model used in this \nevaluation.\nBecause of deficiencies in any of the DAM \ninformation requirements, the results of existing \neconomic evaluations were extremely unlikely to \nbe sufficient to inform a decision now. Therefore, \nthe only studies that were critiqued were those that \nconsidered at least some of the surgical treatments \nfor men with moderate to severe symptoms of \nBPE and no complications, and which estimated \noutcomes using a DAM. \nSearch strategy\nThe following databases were searched for \ninformation on economic evaluations and quality \nof life: MEDLINE (1966\u2013March Week 2 2006), \nEMBASE (1980\u20132006 Week 11), MEDLINE \nIn\u2013Process (20 March 2006), ISI Science Citation \nIndex (1981\u20131 March 2006), Health Management \nInformation Consortium Database (March \n2006), NHS Economic Evaluation Database \n(March 2006) and HTA database (March 2006). \nIn addition, recent conference proceedings of \nthe European Association of Urology, American \nUrological Association and British Association of \nUrological Surgeons were searched. Reference lists \nChapter 4  \nSystematic review of previous  \neconomic evaluationsSystematic review of previous economic evaluations\n18\nof all included studies were scanned to identify \nadditional potentially relevant studies. Full details \nof the search strategies used are documented in \nAppendix 1.\nThe results of the literature searches, after \ndeduplication against the Ovid multifile search, are \npresented in Table 2.\nStudies selected for critique\nThree studies published in six papers that \ncontained data relevant to formulation of the \nDAM were identified. One study by Ackerman and \ncolleagues was published in three papers,78\u201380 and \nanother by DiSantostefano and colleagues was \npublished in two papers.74,81 The third study by \nHoward and Wortley was published as a technology \nassessment report for the Australian Medical \nServices Advisory Committee (MSAC).82\nPopulation\nAll three studies considered essentially similar \npopulations, although DiSantostefano and \ncolleagues and Ackerman and colleagues, in \nconsidering drug treatment and watchful waiting, \nactually considered a broader population. \nAckerman and colleagues considered a cohort aged \n65 years, Howard and Wortley did not state age, \nand DiSantostefano and colleagues considered the \neffect of varying age from 45 to 85 years.\nTechnologies\nDiSantostefano and colleagues and Ackerman and \ncolleagues compared TUMT and TURP in addition \nto drugs whereas Howard and Wortley compared \nTUMT with TURP. None compared strategies, \ni.e. what is the best sequence of treatments if, on \nfailure or relapse (judged in some way), another \nprocedure is planned. Instead they all assumed that \nshould the initial treatment fail then there would \nbe some chance of further treatment, which for all \nthree studies was TURP. However, if the choice of \ninitial treatment is at all dependent on the outcome \nof any future treatments then there is a need to \nconsider the outcome of these future treatments in \nthe economic evaluation. Of course, there might \nalso be reason to consider repeating a procedure \nsuch as TUMT instead of using TURP immediately \non failure or switching to a different procedure \nsuch as TUVP.\nThe epidemiology: \nmodel structure\nTo find the best technology, costs and consequences \n(including utility) must be estimated for each \ntechnology. Individual variability for a given \npopulation and technology implies that the various \nhealth-related events (e.g. degree of symptom \nimprovement, death) that can occur over time \nmust be expressed as probabilities. Therefore, the \nmodel estimates the expected (\u2018average\u2019) cost and \nutility for the population. However, the complexity \nof patient pathways prevents specification of a \nTABLE 2  Results of the search for studies on cost-effectiveness\nDatabase Hits screened\nSelected for full \nassessment\nMEDLINE\/EMBASE\/MEDLINE Extra multifile search (after \ndeduplication in Ovid)\n1213 65\nISI Science Citation Index 88 3\nNHS Economic Evaluation Database 45 0\nHTA database 21 12\nHealth Management Information Consortium Database 31 2\nSelected from conference abstracts 6 0\nTotal 1404 82Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

One \nsolution is a Markov model,83 in which events are \nreduced to a set of discrete health states of fixed \nduration (cycle length). An individual may only \nbe in one health state at a time and at the end of \neach cycle they face the probability of making the \ntransition to another health state. The individual \nwill continue moving between health states until \nthe prespecified number of cycles has been reached \nor until the individual moves into an absorbing \nhealth state (normally death) from where further \ntransitions are not possible. This enables the \ncalculation for each strategy of the expected value \nof cost and utility. These expected values are the \nsum of the value of the cost and utility for each \nstate multiplied by the number of cycles spent in \nthat state. \nAll three studies used a Markov model. The time \nhorizon was 5 years for Ackerman and colleagues \nand 20 years for the other two studies. Cycle length \nwas 3 months for Ackerman and colleagues, 6 \nmonths for Howard and Wortley and 1 year for \nDiSantostefano and colleagues, thus giving 20, \n40 and 20 cycles respectively. The number of \nhealth states considered were 25, four and nine \nrespectively. \nThe epidemiology: \nparameterisation \nof the model\nNo study claimed to have conducted a systematic \nreview of the literature, although Ackerman and \ncolleagues used the term \u2018comprehensive review\u2019.\nEffectiveness\nOne advantage of the simple \u2018chance\u2019 approach to \nsecond treatments is that the probability of failure \ncan be simply assumed to be the probability of \nreoperation. However, the decision-making criteria \nunderlying reported reoperation probabilities \nare usually unknown and different criteria might \nmean different outcomes. DiSantostefano and \ncolleagues derived estimates of treatment failure \n(\u2018no improvement\u2019) from the 1994 Agency for \nHealth Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) \nguideline19,84 and of reoperation for TURP from \nthe AUA guideline19,85 for the period up to 2000. \nReoperation rates for TUMT were derived from \ntwo RCTs.86,87 However, the AHCPR guideline is \nover 10 years old and its authors admit that very \nfew studies reported symptom scores and that those \nthat did used many different methods.84 Although \nthis limitation is allowed for to some extent in the \nwide confidence interval (CI) for this estimate (see \nAccounting for uncertainty in Chapter 10, p.112), \nthe relationship between degree of symptom \nimprovement and probability of retreatment is \nunclear. For example, do those who are counted \nas successful and who thus receive no further \ntreatment continue with, \u2018on average\u2019, almost \ncomplete symptom relief or was the change only \njust sufficient to warrant no further treatment? For \nthose who fail but receive no further treatment, it \nwas not clear to what extent this was because the \nclinician believed that further treatment would not \nwork or because further treatment was refused by \nthe patient. It was also not clear why those who \nreceive TURP have an annual probability of relapse \n(\u2018disease progression\u2019) of about 1%, but those who \nreceive TUMT cannot relapse.\nHoward and Wortley used a single RCT82 for TURP \nand several sources for TUNA to estimate \u2018early \ntreatment failure\u2019 (within 6 months). Longer-term \nfailure rates (equivalent to relapse) were stated \nto come from an RCT and a cohort study for \nTURP with a 10-year follow-up. For TUNA, data \nwere derived from the percentage undergoing \nretreatment after 5 years. \nAckerman and colleagues used the same definition \nof treatment success for all treatments: \u2018significant \nimprovement, achieving a 50% or greater \ndecrease in the AUA symptom score; moderate \nimprovement, achieving a 30\u201349% decrease in the \nAUA symptom score; minimal improvement, a less \nthan 30% decrease in the AUA symptom score\u2019. \nThey cited various publications, as well as the \n\u2018multispeciality clinical panel\u2019, as sources for their \nprobability of each degree of success, although it is \nnot clear how these sources were synthesised. These \nprobabilities were stated to be time dependent, \nalthough not all estimates were shown: the 5-year \nprobabilities of \u2018success\u2019 for TURP and TUMT were \n0.85 and 0.65 respectively.\nAckerman and colleagues78 and DiSantostefano and \ncolleagues74,81 also had health states with different \ndegrees of symptoms. However, this refinement \nwould be important only if the choice of states that \nhave differential effects on outcome is contingent \non the symptom level. For example, if on day one \n90% have some success such that they receive no \nfurther treatment for the next 10 years, it makes \nno difference whether half of them spend that time \nin a state of \u2018mild\u2019 symptoms and half in a state of \n\u2018no\u2019 symptoms or whether all of them spend that \ntime in a single state, as long as the outcome of Systematic review of previous economic evaluations\n20\nthat state is equal to the average of the outcome of \n\u2018mild\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 symptoms, each weighted by 50%.\nComplications\nAll models consider the possibility of \ncomplications, the most comprehensive being \nthat of Ackerman and colleagues.78 However, \ndepending on the source of estimates, it is \npossible that there could be some unnecessary \nand perhaps misleading inclusions. For example, \nDiSantostefano and colleagues argue against the \ninclusion of differential mortality rates because \neither there is no difference between treatments \nor the difference is so small that to try to estimate \nwould lead to bias.74,81 This is backed up by long-\nterm studies;85 the same argument can be made for \nlife-threatening complications such as myocardial \ninfarction (MI).\nRetrograde ejaculation occurs as a result of removal \nof prostate tissue by whatever means and does not \nsignificantly lower the utility value of successful \ntreatment and is not associated with any costs. \nErectile dysfunction (ED) following prostate surgery \nis a difficult and controversial issue: the meta-\nanalysis presented later and previous systematic \nreviews have shown no statistically significant \ndifference in occurrence between types of surgery. \nFor the purposes of the cost-effectiveness analysis \nmodelled over a 10-year period, we chose not \nto include ED as a complication as it was more \nlikely to be caused by other concurrent, randomly \ndistributed disease processes than the interventions \nunder consideration. In addition, there is \nincreasing evidence of an association between ED \nand urinary symptoms that would also confound \nestimated rates.\nUtilities\nAll three studies used cost-utility analysis (CUA) \nand each had a utility of 1 for some states reflecting \neither \u2018significant improvement\u2019 or \u2018remission\u2019 and \nof 0 for death. Only Ackerman and colleagues78 \nelicited preferences using the standard gamble \napproach75 to estimate utilities for each of their \nother health states; however, their sample was small \n(only n = 6 or n = 7 for each of the \u2018risk averse\u2019 \nand \u2018non-risk averse\u2019 groups). Such data may be \nunreliable as they are based on so few observations. \nThey may also not be comparable with utilities \ncalculated for other patient populations \u2013 a \nlarger sample from the general public would have \nbeen better. DiSantostefano and colleagues74,81 \nused utilities from a variety of sources, including \nAckerman and colleagues78 for incontinence. \nHoward and Wortley simply used opinion (they \ndo not state the source) and values for treatment \nsuccess (as full health, i.e. 1) for failure (0.9) or side \neffects (0.95).82\nCosts\nAll three studies estimated costs in at least the \ncategories of \u2018procedure\u2019, \u2018complications\u2019 and \n\u2018failure\u2019 (implying the inclusion of reoperation \ncosts). However, Howard and Wortley and \nAckerman and colleagues simply used estimates for \neach category and provided no further breakdown. \nDiSantostefano and colleagues provided a \nslightly fuller breakdown by resource use for \neach procedure such as number of physician \nvisits. However, none of the studies differentiated \nbetween procedure and hospital stay and none \nexpressed cost of equipment as a function of its \nlifetime or reusability.\nSensitivity analysis\nAll three studies performed some deterministic \nsensitivity analyses. Only DiSantostefano \nand colleagues used probabilistic analysis for \nparameter uncertainty.74,81 Their distributions \nfor probability of treatment failure, reoperation \nand complications were estimated appropriately \nusing beta distributions. They stated that they \nwere parameterised using the 95% confidence \nintervals from various sources, for example the \nAUA meta-analysis,85 and presumably used the \nmeans from these sources. The distributions for \ntheir cost estimates were assumed to be normal \nand parameterised from US national databases for \nTURP and TUMT: they stated that the standard \ndeviation was used, but the appropriate statistic is \nthe standard error. Given the likely large sample \nsize of these databases, the standard deviation \nwould probably considerably overestimate the \nuncertainty, although this is a matter of judgement.\nConclusion\nPrevious studies have attempted to address \nthe challenges of constructing a DAM for BPE \nsurgical treatments. All of these studies had some \nlimitations, which have been discussed. Taking \nthese limitations into account it is suggested that a \nfuture DAM should: Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Reference \nlists of all included studies were scanned to identify \nadditional potentially relevant studies. Full details \nof the search strategies used are documented in \nAppendix 1.\nAll titles and abstracts identified in these ways \nwere assessed to identify potentially eligible \nstudies. Two reviewers independently assessed \nthem for inclusion, using a study eligibility form \ndeveloped for this purpose (see Appendix 2). \nAny disagreements were resolved by consensus or \narbitration.\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nTypes of studies\nIndividual RCTs were eligible for inclusion \nirrespective of publication language if they \nassessed interventional treatment options for the \ntreatment of BPE. Initially, it was intended to \ninclude population-based observational studies \nwith a minimum follow-up of 3 years but this \nwas subsequently deemed not to be necessary \nas long-term follow-up data from RCTs was \nsufficient to provide more robust estimates of \nrare complications and effectiveness. Abstracts \nwere considered only when no full-text RCTs were \navailable for a particular intervention.\nTypes of participants\nTrials of men with a clinical diagnosis of BPE who \nhave undergone surgery were included. Patients \nundergoing conservative management (watchful \nwaiting or medical therapy) were excluded. \nTypes of interventions\nMethods of surgical intervention for BPE included:\nminimally invasive techniques \u2022\t\ntransurethral  microwave  thermotherapy    \u2013\n(TUMT)\ntransurethral  needle  ablation  (TUNA)  of    \u2013\nthe prostate\nstents   \u2013\nhigh-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)   \u2013\ntransurethral  ethanol  ablation  of  the    \u2013\nprostate (TEAP)\nwater thermotherapy (WIT)   \u2013\ntransurethral  laser  coagulation  of  the    \u2013\nprostate\ntransurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) \u2022\t\ntransurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)  \u2022\t\n\u2013 reference standard\nother tissue ablative techniques \u2022\t\ntransurethral  laser  prostatectomy  \u2013    \u2013\nresection\nChapter 5  \nMethods of, and studies included in,  \nthe systematic reviews of clinical effectivenessMethods of, and studies included in, the systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness\n24\ntransurethral  laser  prostatectomy  \u2013    \u2013\nvaporisation\nbipolar TURP   \u2013\ntransurethral  electrovaporisation  of  the    \u2013\nprostate (TUVP)\nbipolar TUVP   \u2013\ntransurethral vaporesection of the prostate    \u2013\n(TUVRP)\nbipolar TUVRP.   \u2013\nTypes of outcomes\nData were sought to describe both short-term \nand long-term outcomes.

Full-text copies \nof all potentially relevant studies were obtained \nand two reviewers independently assessed them \nfor inclusion. Reviewers were not blinded to the \nstudy authors, institutions or sources of the reports. \nAny disagreements were resolved by consensus or \narbitration. \nA data extraction form was developed to record \ndetails of trial methods, interventions, participants\u2019 \ncharacteristics and outcomes (see Appendix 3). Two \nreviewers independently extracted data from the \nincluded studies. Any differences that could not \nbe resolved through discussion were referred to an \narbiter.\nQuality assessment strategy\nTwo reviewers working independently assessed the \nmethodological quality of the included full-text \nstudies. Again, any disagreements were resolved \nby consensus or arbitration. Primary RCTs were \nassessed using an assessment tool, drawing on the \nschema suggested by the NHS Centre for Reviews \nand Dissemination,88 Verhagen and colleagues,89 \nDowns and Black90 and the Generic Appraisal Tool \nfor Epidemiology (see Appendix 4).\nData synthesis\nFor trials with multiple publications, only the most \nup-to-date data for each outcome were included. \nDichotomous outcome data were combined using \nthe Mantel\u2013Haenszel relative risk (RR) method \nand continuous outcomes were combined using \nthe inverse variance weighted mean difference \n(WMD) method. The results are all reported \nusing a fixed-effects model. Chi-squared tests and \nI-squared statistics were used to explore statistical \nheterogeneity across studies and, when present, \nrandom-effects methods were applied. Other \npossible reasons for heterogeneity were explored \nusing sensitivity analyses. The meta-analyses were \nconducted using the standard Cochrane software \nRevMan 4.2. Because of the lack of uniformity of \nthe data presented by many studies, a qualitative \nreview looking for consistency between studies was \nalso performed.\nSymptoms assessed with the IPSS and the AUA \nsymptom index were considered equivalent and \ntherefore trials reporting symptoms in these ways \nwere combined. Studies reporting symptoms as \nMadsen\u2013Iversen symptom indexes were analysed \nseparately. The IPSS\/AUA scale ranges from 0 \nto 35. Scores ranging from 0 to 7 are equivalent \nto mild symptoms, from 8 to 19 are equivalent \nto moderate symptoms, and from 20 to 35 are \nequivalent to severe symptoms.

Also, for the purposes \nof this review, \u2018strictures\u2019 included bladder neck \nstenosis and urethral stricture as it was difficult to \ndistinguish between them given the information \nprovided in the trials and because definitions \nof these complications were inconsistent from \nreport to report. Only blood transfusion, urinary \nretention, urinary tract infection, strictures, TUR \nsyndrome and urinary incontinence are presented \nin the results section as these were felt to be the \nmost important for the economic model. Other \noutcomes are presented in the appendices.\nIn terms of urodynamic outcomes, only the results \nfor peak urine flow rate are presented in the body \nof this report because clinical experts consider \nthis to be a more precise measure of a urodynamic \noutcome.

There were 94 relevant \ncomparisons in the 88 eligible RCTs (8494 \nrandomised participants); one trial had four \narms and four trials had three arms (Table 5). \nIn the following chapters an overview of the \ncharacteristics of the included studies for each \nidentified comparison is presented. \nAssessment of effectiveness\nThe assessment of effectiveness is reported \nin the following chapters, beginning with the \nminimally invasive techniques.

Six RCTs, reported in \n19 papers,86,124,165\u2013169,207\u2013218 were eligible for this \ncomparison, in which a total of 549 participants \nwere randomised. The number of participants \nrandomised to TUMT or TURP ranged from 2168 \nto 99.165 The total number of participants allocated \nto TUMT was 314 and the total allocated to TURP \nwas 235.\nTwo studies each took place in the \nNetherlands166,169 and Sweden167,168 and one in the \nUK,124 and one was a multicentre study involving \nSweden, Denmark and the US.165 Only three \nstudies gave details of the recruitment dates;165,166,169 \nrecruitment dates ranged from January 1994 to \nNovember 1999. \nFour out of the six RCTs reported baseline IPSS\/\nAUA scores. The total number of participants who \nhad moderate symptoms of BPE and underwent \nTUMT was 61 (26%), compared with 51 (31%) with \nmoderate symptoms allocated to TURP. There were \n177 (74%) patients with severe symptoms in the \nTUMT group and 112 (69%) with severe symptoms \nin the TURP group. \nOf the studies reporting estimated prostate size, \n69 (22%) and 245 (78%) patients allocated to \nTUMT had moderate-sized and large prostates \nrespectively. Of the patients allocated to TURP, 40 \n(17%) had moderate-sized and 195 (83%) had large \nprostates. \nChapter 6  \nClinical effectiveness of  \nminimally invasive techniques\nTABLE 6  Summary of the baseline characteristics, TUMT vs TURP\nStudy Comparators\nNumber of \nparticipants\nAge \n(years)\nSymptom \nscorea\nQmax \n(ml\/s)\nResidual \nvolume \n(ml)\nProstate \nsize  \n(ml)\nAhmed et al., \n1997124\nTUMT 30 69 18.5 10.1 94 37\nTURP 30 69 18.4 9.5 109 46\nDahlstrand et al., \n1993167\nTUMT 39 68 11.2b 8.0 105 33\nTURP 40 70 13.3b 7.9 116 37\nDahlstrand et al., \n1995168\nTUMT 37 67 12.1b 8.6 194 43c\nTURP 32 70 13.6b 8.6 1104 45c\nd\u2019Ancona et al., \n1998166\nTUMT 31 69 18.3 9.3 49 43\nTURP 21 69 16.7 9.3 91 45\nde la Rosette et al., \n2003169\nTUMT 78 67 20.0 9.2 65 51\nTURP 66 66 20.0 8.0 91 52\nWagrell et al., \n2002165\nTUMT 99 67 21.0 7.6 106 49\nTURP 46 69 20.4 7.8 94 53\nTUMT, transurethral microwave thermotherapy; TURP , transurethral resection of the prostate.\nData given as mean values (unless stated otherwise)\na  Symptom scores given as IPSS\/AUA (unless stated otherwise).\nb  Prostate length (mm).\nc  Madsen score.Clinical effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques\n30\nAssessment of effectiveness\nTables giving a detailed description for all \noutcomes can be found in Appendix 8. The results \nof the meta-analyses are given in Appendix 9. Note \nthat in terms of long-term evaluation, only the \nlongest follow-up is presented.\nSymptom scores\nAt 3 months\nOf the six eligible studies, three165,166,213 (n = 290) \nprovided information on IPSS\/AUA scores \n(Appendix 8.1, Table 42). At 3 months IPSS was \nhigher for TUMT than for TURP (Figure 3, \ncomparison 01:01:01). Overall, the WMD was 4.08 \n(95% CI 2.78\u20135.39, p < 0.001). There was evidence \nof statistical heterogeneity, but the direction of \neffect was consistent even though the size of effect \nestimates varied. Using a random-effects model did \nnot change this pattern. The cause of heterogeneity \nis unclear but in the study by d\u2019Ancona and \ncolleagues166 patients appear to have milder disease \nthan in the other two studies. \nIn total, four studies166,168,210,213 (n = 306) provided \ninformation on the improvement of Madsen\u2013\nIversen scores after surgery (Appendix 8.1, Table \n42). Meta-analysis of the four trials showed \nheterogeneity, with results tending to favour TURP, \nbut the difference was not statistically significant \n(Figure 3, comparison 01:02:01: WMD 0.63, 95% \nCI \u20130.08 to 1.33, p = 0.08). The direction and size \nof effect varied across studies, with Dahlstrand and \ncolleagues168 reporting lower scores for TUMT. \nThis study appears to be contributing much of the \nstatistical heterogeneity that is present and this \ncould be because patients allocated to the TURP \ngroup had higher residual volumes. Removal of \nthis study from the analysis resulted in a substantial \ndecrease in heterogeneity.\nAt 12 months\nMeta-analysis of data from three trials165,166,169 \nreporting IPSS\/AUA scores at 12 months after \nsurgery showed a statistically significant worse \nscore for TUMT compared with TURP (Figure 3, \ncomparison 01:01:03: WMD 2.41, 95% CI 1.40\u2013\n3.42, p < 0.001). Again, there was marked statistical \nheterogeneity between the three studies. When a \nrandom-effects model was applied the direction \nof effect remained the same but the difference \nbetween the groups was no longer statistically \nsignificant (WMD 2.26, 95% CI \u20130.38 to 4.91). \nAt 12 months, all four trials reporting Madsen\u2013\nIversen symptom scores166\u2013168,213 reported higher \n(worse) scores following TUMT (Figure 3, \ncomparison 01:02:03). Overall, the WMD was 1.97 \n(95% CI 1.27\u20132.66, p < 0.001).\nLonger-term follow-up\nTwo studies reported data beyond 12 months.166,169 \nThese data also favoured TURP, but again with \nvariation between trials in the estimated size of \ndifference (Figure 3, comparison 01:01:05: WMD \n8.90, 95% CI 6.65\u201311.15, p < 0.001). A similar \ntrend was observed for the earlier follow-ups. \nComplications\nData describing complications are tabulated in \nAppendix 8.1, Table 43. Information on 13 types of \ncomplications was identified across the six eligible \nstudies for this comparison. Results regarding \nblood transfusion, urinary retention, urinary tract \ninfection, strictures, TUR syndrome and urinary \nincontinence are presented in this section (Figure \n4). Results for other complications are presented \nin Appendix 9.1, comparison 01:03. The results of \nthese meta-analyses should be treated with caution \nas the length of follow-up of the RCTs varied.\nBlood transfusion\nBlood transfusion was reported in three \nstudies.124,166,168 None of the patients required a \nblood transfusion following TUMT compared \nwith four (5%) patients following TURP (Figure 4, \ncomparison 01:03:01: RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01\u20131.98, \np = 0.13).\nUrinary retention\nIn both trials with data,165,169 urinary retention \nwas reported more commonly in the patients \nundergoing TUMT than in those undergoing \nTURP (Figure 4, comparison 01:03:02: RR 1.64, \n95% CI 0.77\u20133.50, p = 0.20). \nUrinary tract infection\nMeta-analysis of data from five studies124,165\u2013168 \nshowed no statistically significant differences \nbetween the two arms; the direction of effect varied \nacross studies with two124,165 favouring TUMT \n(Figure 4, comparison 01:03:03: 16\/237 versus \n13\/174, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.53\u20132.08, p = 0.90). \nStricture\nOnly one stricture (urethral) was reported amongst \n172 participants allocated to TUMT versus 11 \n(including five bladder neck stenoses) amongst \n168 participants allocated to TURP (Figure 4, \ncomparison 01:03:04: RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.75, \np = 0.02). The direction and size of effect were \nconsistent across the four studies reporting this \noutcome.

This difference does \nnot reach statistical significance, but the confidence \nintervals were wide and therefore important \nclinical differences may exist (Figure 4, comparison \n01:03:05: RR 5.83, 95% CI 0.24\u2013140.55, p = 0.28). \nUrinary incontinence\nA total of 10 (4.9%) people were reported to have \nincontinence episodes amongst 205 allocated \nTUMT interventions compared with 13 (8.3%) \npeople amongst 157 allocated TURP interventions \n(Figure 4, comparison 01:03:06: RR 0.61, 95% CI \n0.30\u20131.26, p = 0.18). The direction and size of \neffect varied across studies and there was evidence \nof statistical heterogeneity across the three studies \nreporting this outcome.165,167,169 This may be \nbecause some of the studies failed to report the \ntype of incontinence and the length of follow-up \nvaried. \nQuality of life\nTwo studies165,169 used the IPSS QoL (0\u20136) \nquestionnaire to measure quality of life of people \nundergoing TUMT or TURP (Appendix 8.1, Table \n44 and Figure 5), where 0 is being delighted and \n6 represents feeling terrible concerning urinary \nsymptoms.\nAt 3 months\nBoth studies165,169 reported better quality of life \nscores at 3 months following TURP. The mean \ndifference based on data from one study165 was \n0.40 for TUMT versus TURP, but this result did \nnot reach statistical significance (Figure 5: MD 0.40, \n95% CI \u20130.17 to 0.97, p = 0.17).\nReview:  BPE\nComparison:  01 TUMT vs TURP\nOutcome:  09 Quality of life (IPSS QoL)\nStudy\nor subcategory n\nTUMT\nMean (SD) n\nTURP\nMean (SD)\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\n013months\nWagrell, 2002\n165 84 1.50 (1.40) 41 1.10 (1.60) 100.00 0.40 (\u22120.17 to 0.97)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 84 41 100.00 0.40 (\u22120.17 to 0.97)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.37 (p = 0.17)\n02 12 months\nWagrell, 2002\n165 93 1.50 (1.70) 43 1.40 (1.30) 35.86 0.10 (\u22120.42 to 0.62)\nde la Rosette, 2003\n169 58 1.90 (1.30) 48 0.60 (0.70) 64.14 1.30 (0.91\u20131.69)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 151 91 100.00 0.87 (0.56\u20131.18)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 13.12, df = 1( p = 0.0003), I\n2 = 92.4%\nTest for overall effect: z = 5.47 (p < 0.00001)\n032years\nde la Rosette, 2003\n169 46 1.90 (1.00) 38 0.90 (1.10) 100.00 1.00 (0.55\u20131.45)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 46 38 100.00 1.00 (0.55\u20131.45)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 4.32 (p < 0.0001)\n043years\nde la Rosette, 2003\n169 35 2.30 (1.20) 33 0.60 (0.80) 100.00 1.70 (1.22\u20132.18)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 35 33 100.00 1.70 (1.22\u20132.18)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 6.91 (p < 0.00001)\n\u221210 \u22125  0  5  10\n Favours TUMT  Favours TURP\nFIGURE 5  Quality of life, TUMT vs TURP .Clinical effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques\n34\nAt 12 months\nEvidence from the two studies165,169 showed \npoorer quality of life scores following TUMT than \nfollowing TURP (Figure 5: WMD 0.87, 95% CI \n0.56\u20131.18, p < 0.001). The size of the estimated \ndifference varied but the reasons for this were \nunclear. \nLonger-term follow-up\nThe mean difference based on data from one \nstudy169 was 1.70 for TUMT versus TURP in terms \nof quality of life (Figure 5: 95% CI 1.22\u20132.18, \np < 0.001). However, this same trial gave higher \nestimates of long-term IPSS\/AUA differences than \nother trials, so the size of the difference in quality \nof life should be interpreted cautiously. \nUrodynamic outcomes\nData on peak urine flow rate, voided volume, \nresidual volume, detrusor pressure and prostate \nsize were reported to a varying extent across the \nsix studies.124,165\u2013169 Only peak urine flow rate is \npresented in this section. Results for the other \nurodynamic outcomes are presented in Appendix \n8.1, Table 45 and Appendix 9.1, comparisons \n01:04\u201301:08.\nAt all time points considered, the peak urine flow \nrate was statistically significantly lower in the \nTUMT arm than in the TURP arm (Appendix \n9.1, comparison 01:04); at both 3 and 12 months \nthere was evidence of heterogeneity between \nstudies included in the meta-analyses but there was \nconsistency in the direction of effect. At 3 months, \nusing the random-effects method, the WMD was \n5.32 ml\/s (95% CI \u20136.95 to \u20133.70, p < 0.001). The \nmain source of heterogeneity appeared to be from \nthe study by Wagrell and colleagues;165 however, \nthe reasons for this remain unclear. When data \nfrom this study were excluded from the analysis, \nthe trend towards TURP was maintained but the \nWMD increased (WMD 7.04, 95% CI 4.93\u20139.15, \np < 0.001). At 12 months, fitting a random-effects \nmodel only increased the imprecision around the \nestimate of relative effectiveness. \nDescriptors of care\nData describing descriptors of care are tabulated in \nAppendix 8.1, Table 46. Information on length of \nhospital stay and reoperation rates was identified \nto a varying extent across the six eligible studies for \nthis comparison.\nDuration of operation\nNo studies reported duration of operation.\nLength of hospital stay\nLength of hospital stay was reported in two \nstudies.166,169 Note that those allocated to TUMT \nwere treated as outpatients and therefore hospital \nstay was longer in the TURP arm (Appendix 8.1, \nTable 46; Appendix 9.1, comparison 01:11: WMD \n5.30 days, 95% CI 4.48\u20136.12, p < 0.001).\nReoperation\nFive studies124,166\u2013169 provided details on reoperation \nrates. A total of 22 (10.2%) reoperations were \nreported amongst 215 participants allocated to \nTUMT compared with 9 (4.8%) amongst 189 \nparticipants allocated to TURP. Meta-analysis \nof the five trials just failed to reach statistical \nsignificance at the conventional 5% level (Appendix \n9.1, comparison 01:12: RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.96\u20134.18, \np = 0.06). This result should be treated with caution \nas the length of follow-up of the RCTs varied.\nSummary and conclusions \nof the evidence for and \nagainst the intervention\nThis review considered data from 549 participants \nacross six RCTs of generally moderate to poor \nquality (or poor reporting). Compared with TURP \nthe data suggest that, after TUMT, improvement in \nIPSS\/AUA symptom scores and quality of life is less, \npeak urine flow rate is lower, but length of hospital \nstay is shorter. Data describing blood transfusion, \nurinary retention, urinary tract infection, stricture, \nTUR syndrome, urinary incontinence and \nreoperation rates are too few to provide sufficiently \nprecise estimates of differences but are consistent \nwith fewer complications following TUMT, such as \nstrictures and incontinence. \nIn this review the results for symptom scores, peak \nurine flow rate and urinary incontinence displayed \nstatistically significant heterogeneity. Consistency \nin the direction and size of effect varied in the last \noutcome. Much of the heterogeneity might be due \nto differences in the characteristics of participants, \nparticularly differences in prostate size. Moreover, \nit may in part have been due to differences in \npower delivery or other technical outputs of \nsurgery across studies and to differences in the way \nthat urinary incontinence is defined. Other likely \nsources of heterogeneity include differences in the \nlength of follow-up. \nClinical effect size\nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The \nresults of the meta-analyses are given in Appendix \n9.2. Because of the nature of the comparator \nintervention (sham), the most useful information \ncomes from short-term outcomes. The value of \nlong-term assessment of outcomes is limited by \na high dropout rate as most of the patients were \njudged to require a true TUMT procedure by \n12 months; it is likely that only the least severe \npatients at baseline remained untreated at this time \npoint, thus comparisons limited to untreated men \nare subject to selection bias.\nSymptom scores\nAt 3 months\nOf the 11 eligible studies, eight provided \ninformation on symptom scores at 3 months \nfollowing surgery.125,126,133,159,160,170,172,173 Six of those \nreported IPSS\/AUA scores.125,126,159,160,170,173 In all \nstudies, IPSS\/AUA scores were superior in the \nTUMT group and this was statistically significant in \nall six studies (p < 0.05). Only three studies125,126,159 \npresented data in a form that was sufficiently \nsimilar to allow quantitative synthesis (Figure 6, \ncomparison 02:01:01). The WMD was \u20135.69 (95% \nCI \u20137.38 to \u20133.99, p < 0.00001) for TUMT versus \nsham surgery. This result is consistent with the data \nfrom those trials that provided data that were not \namenable for meta-analysis.\nMeta-analysis of three studies reporting Madsen\u2013\nIversen scores126,133,172 showed that TUMT resulted \nin a greater decrease in score than sham treatment \n(Figure 6, comparison 02:02:01: WMD \u20135.66, 95% \nCI \u20136.85 to \u20134.46, p < 0.000001). There was some \nevidence of heterogeneity and, when a random-\neffects model was fitted, the principal change was \nin the width of the confidence interval. The main \nsource of heterogeneity appeared to be the study \nby Ogden and colleagues;133 however, the reasons \nfor this are unclear. When data from Ogden and \ncolleagues were removed from the analysis, the \ntrend towards TUMT was maintained but the WMD \ndecreased (WMD \u20135.10, 95% CI \u20136.40 to \u20133.79, \np < 0.00001). \nAt 12 months\nNo studies reported IPSS\/AUA symptom scores for \npatients at 12 months after the surgery. \nOne study reported Madsen\u2013Iversen symptom \nscores at 12 months following surgery.172 The WMD \nwas \u20134.00 (Figure 6, comparison 02:02:03: 95% CI \n\u20135.81 to \u20132.19, p < 0.0001). \nLonger-term follow-up \nNo longer-term follow-up data on symptom scores \nhave been reported by any of the eligible studies.\nComplications\nData describing complications by study are \ndetailed in Appendix 8.2, Table 48. Out of the \neligible studies, complications were reported \nin ten.125,126,133,143,159,160,170\u2013173 Ten categories of \ncomplications were identified. Results regarding \nblood transfusion, urinary retention, urinary tract \ninfection, strictures and urinary incontinence are \npresented in this section (Figure 7). Results for \nother complications are presented in Appendix \n9.2, comparison 02:03. The results of these meta-\nanalyses should be treated with caution as the \nlength of follow-up of the RCTs varied.\nBlood transfusion\nOnly one study159 provided details on blood \ntransfusion rates. There were no reports of blood \ntransfusions amongst 125 and 44 patients allocated \nto TUMT or sham respectively.\nUrinary retention\nAll seven trials with data showed higher rates of \nurinary retention after TUMT. This applied to a \ntotal of 77 (12%) patients amongst 644 allocated \nto TUMT compared with two (0.5%) amongst 360 \npatients allocated to a sham procedure (Figure 7, \ncomparison 02:03:02: RR 10.57, 95% CI 4.11\u2013\n27.20, p < 0.0001). This result should be treated \nwith caution as the length of follow-up of the RCTs \nvaried.\nUrinary tract infection\nMeta-analysis of data from four trials133,143,159,173 that \nreported urinary tract infections showed a higher \nnumber of infections following TUMT; however, \nthis was not statistically significant (Figure 7, \ncomparison 02:03:03: RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.84\u20132.67, \np = 0.17). \nStricture\nUrethral strictures were reported in two trials.159,170 \nThree cases were reported in one trial following \nTUMT, with no cases following sham treatment \n(Figure 7, comparison 02:03:04: 3\/246 versus 0\/106, \nRR 2.50, 95% CI 0.13\u201347.46, p = 0.54).\nIncontinence\nData on incontinence from one trial159 showed five \ncases (4%) out of a total of 125 patients following \nTUMT versus no cases after sham treatment. \nThis result was not statistically significant \nand confidence intervals were wide (Figure 7, Clinical effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques\n38\nReview:  BPE\nComparison:  02 TUMT vs sham\nOutcome:  01 IPSS\/AUA\nStudy\nor subcategory n\nTUMT\nMean (SD) n\nSham\nMean (SD)\nWMD (\ufb01xed) \n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nWMD (\ufb01xed) \n95% CI\n013months\nBdesha, 1994\n125 22 7.10 (5.00) 18 16.20 (7.35) 18.00 \u22129.10 (\u221213.09 to \u22125.11)\nBlute, 1996\n126 64 11.30 (6.30) 31 16.30 (7.60) 30.00 \u22125.00 (\u22128.09 to \u22121.91)\nLarson, 1998\n159 123 9.60 (5.94) 40 14.50 (6.77) 52.00 \u22124.90 (\u22127.25 to \u22122.55)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 209 89 100.00 \u22125.69 (\u22127.38 to \u22123.99)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 3.44,d f = 2( p = 0.18), I\n2 = 41.8%\nTest for overall effect: z = 6.59 (p < 0.00001)\n026months\nLarson, 1998\n159 120 10.50 (7.26) 35 14.30 (6.34) 100.00 \u22123.80 (\u22126.27 to \u22121.33)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 120 35 100.00 \u22123.80 (\u22126.27 to \u22121.33)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 3.02 (p = 0.003)\nReview:  BPE\nComparison:  02 TUMT vs sham\nOutcome:  02 Madsen-Iversen\nStudy\nor subcategory n\nTUMT\nMean (SD) n\nSham\nMean (SD)\nWMD (\ufb01xed) \n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nWMD (\ufb01xed) \n95% CI\n013months\nBlute, 1996\n126 75 6.30 (5.00) 35 10.80 (4.40) 41.86 \u22124.50 (\u22126.35 to \u22122.65)\nOgden, 1993\n133 21 4.30 (4.44) 19 12.80 (5.00) 16.46 \u22128.50 (\u221211.44 to \u22125.56)\nde Wildt, 1996\n172 45 4.70 (3.93) 43 10.40 (4.85) 41.68 \u22125.70 (\u22127.55 to \u22123.85)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 141 97 100.00 \u22125.66 (\u22126.85 to \u22124.46)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 5.10,d f = 2( p = 0.08), I\n2 = 60.8%\nTest for overall effect: z = 9.29 (p < 0.00001)\n026months\nde la Rosette, 1994\n223 24 5.30 (4.40) 23 9.10 (4.31) 100.00 \u22123.80 (\u22126.29 to \u22121.31)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 24 23 100.00 \u22123.80 (\u22126.29 to \u22121.31)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 2.99 (p = 0.003)\n03 12 months\nde Wildt, 1996\n172 33 4.20 (3.37) 13 8.20 (2.57) 100.00 \u22124.00 (\u22125.81 to \u22122.19)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 33 13 100.00 \u22124.00 (\u22125.81 to \u22122.19)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 4.33 (p < 0.0001)\n\u221210 \u22125  0  5  10\n Favours TUMT  Favours sham\n\u221210 \u22125  0  5  10\n Favours TUMT   Favours sham\nFIGURE 6  Symptom scores, TUMT vs sham.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

In two studies159,173 the \nquality of life was assessed using the IPSS QoL \n(0\u20136) questionnaire. This was evaluated by patients\u2019 \nresponses to the question of how they would feel if \ntheir current urinary symptoms were to continue \nindefinitely. In the third study170 quality of life \nindex was used and in the final study133 quality of \nlife was measured using a questionnaire derived \nfrom the Veterans\u2019 Administration study of TURP \nversus watchful waiting. This questionnaire had \nfive sections: A, perception of urinary difficulties; \nB, sexual performance; C, activities of daily \nliving; D, general psychological well-being; and \nE, social activities. At the 3-month evaluation, \ntwo studies133,173 reported higher quality of life \nfollowing TUMT. This difference was statistically \nsignificant in both studies (p < 0.05). Larson and \ncolleagues159 report that the improvement in \nquality of life score remained at a comparable level \nin the 12-month evaluation in the TUMT group. \nUrodynamic outcomes\nData on peak urine flow rate, voided volume \nand residual volume were reported across 11 \nstudies.125,126,133,143,159,160,170\u2013174 Only peak urine \nflow rate is presented in this section. Results for \nthe other urodynamic outcomes are presented \nin Appendix 8.2, Table 50 and Appendix 9.2, \ncomparisons 02:04\u201302:09.\nA total of seven studies125,126,133,159,172\u2013174 reported \npeak urine flow rate at 3 months after surgery. \nIn all but one study174 the peak urine flow \nrate was higher in the TUMT group. Six \nstudies125,126,133,159,172,174 presented data that were \nsufficiently similar to allow quantitative synthesis \n(Appendix 9.2, comparison 02:04:01: WMD \n2.53 ml\/s, 95% CI 1.69\u20133.37, p < 0.001). With \nregard to longer-term follow-up (12 months), only \none study172 reported this outcome (WMD 2.90, \n95% CI \u20130.24 to 6.04, p = 0.07). \nDescriptors of care\nData describing descriptors of care are tabulated \nin Appendix 8.2, Table 51. Information on \nreoperation rates was identified in five studies.\nDuration of operation\nNo studies reported this outcome.\nLength of hospital stay\nNo studies reported this outcome.\nReoperation\nThe percentage of patients requiring a reoperation \nin the TUMT group was 6% compared with 54% \nof patients in the sham group requiring surgery. \nMeta-analysis of five trials125,133,159,171,172 presents \na RR of 0.14 in favour of TUMT (95% CI 0.09\u2013\n0.23, p < 0.00001).37,46,69,80,81 This result should be \ninterpreted with caution as the length of follow-up \nvaried.\nSummary and conclusions \nof the evidence for and \nagainst the intervention\nThis review considered data from 1209 participants \nacross 11 RCTs of generally moderate to poor \nquality (with respect to conduct and reporting). \nThe data suggest that TUMT both reduces \nsymptoms and increases peak urine flow rate at \n3 months after the procedure. Reoperation rates \nfor TUMT were lower than for sham. Patients who \nunderwent TUMT had a high risk of developing \nurinary retention. Confidence intervals were wide. \nThe meta-analyses failed to indicate differences in \nthe incidence of blood transfusion, strictures and \nurinary incontinence, although the direction of \neffect was consistent with what would be expected \nafter an operative procedure, again with wide \nconfidence intervals. \nIn this review the data contributing to meta-\nanalyses were too few to provide precise estimates \nof differences, particularly for the complications, \nand confidence intervals were so wide that clinically \nimportant differences could not be ruled out. \nClinical effect size\nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for which \ndata were available is given in Table 9. Again, these \nshould be interpreted in view of the comments \nmentioned above. Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Of the studies reporting this \ncharacteristic, 65 (32%) and 136 (66%) participants \nrandomised to TUNA had moderate-sized and \nlarge prostates respectively. Of the patients \nallocated to TURP, 56 (28%) had moderate-sized \nprostates and 143 (72%) had large prostates.\nTABLE 9  Summary of the clinical effect sizes from meta-analyses, TUMT vs sham\nOutcome\nNumber of trials \nMA (total) Effect size 95% CI p-value\nIPSS\/AUA score\n3 months 3 (6) \u20135.69a \u20137.38 to \u20133.99 < 0.001\n12 months 0 (1) NR NR NR\nLonger term 0 (0) NR NR NR\nMadsen\u2013Iversen score\n3 months 3 (4) \u20135.66a \u20136.85 to \u20134.46 < 0.001\n12 months 1 (3) \u20134.00a \u20135.81 to \u20132.19 < 0.001\nLonger term 0 (0) NR NR NR\nBlood transfusion 1 (1) NE NE NE\nUrinary retention 8 (8) 9.12b 3.36\u201324.80 < 0.001\nUrinary tract infection 4 (4) 1.49b 0.84\u20132.67 0.17\nTUR syndrome 0 (0) NR NR NR\nStricture 2 (2) 2.50b 0.13\u201347.46 0.54\nIncontinence 1 (1) 3.93b 0.22\u201369.63 0.35\nQuality of life\n3 months 0 (2) NR NR NR\n12 months 0 (0) NR NR NR\nLonger term\nQmax\n3 months 6 (9) 2.53a 1.69\u20133.37 < 0.001\n12 months 1 (4) 2.90a \u20130.24 to 6.04 0.07\nLonger term 0 (0) NR NR NR\nDuration of operation 0 (0) NR NR NR\nLength of stay 0 (0) NR NR NR\nReoperation 5 (5) 0.14b 0.09\u20130.23 < 0.001\nIPSS\/AUA, International Prostate Symptom Score\/American Urological Association; MA, meta-analysed; NR, not reported; \nTUMT, transurethral microwave thermotherapy; TUR, transurethral resection.\na  Weighted mean difference.\nb  Relative risk.Clinical effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques\n42\nTABLE 10  Summary of the baseline characteristics, TUNA vs TURP\nStudy Comparators\nNumber of \nparticipants\nAge \n(years)\nSymptom \nscorea\nQmax \n(ml\/s)\nResidual \nvolume \n(ml)\nProstate \nsize \n(ml)\nCimentepe et al., \n2003175\nTUNA  26 60 22.9 9.8 67 46\nTURP 33 63 24.1 9.2 76 49\nHill et al., 2004144 TUNA  65 66 23.9 8.8 92 36\nTURP 56 66 24.1 8.8 83 36\nHindley et al., \n2001176\nTUNA  25 66b 22b 8.5 55 NR\nTURP 25 71b 20b 9.0 74 NR\nKim et al., 2006151 TUNA  110 66 20.8 7.0 257 41\nTURP 110 67 24.0 11.9 187 44\nNR, not reported; TUNA, transurethral needle ablation; TURP , transurethral resection of the prostate.\nData given as mean values (unless stated otherwise).\na  Symptom scores given as IPSS\/AUA.\nb  Median.\nAssessment of effectiveness\nTables giving a detailed description for all \noutcomes can be found in Appendix 8.3.

This \nresult is consistent with that observed in the \nstudies by Hindley and colleagues176 and Kim and \ncolleagues.151\nLonger-term follow-up\nOnly one trial144 reported 5-year IPSS\/AUA scores. \nAt this point in time, TUNA and TURP appeared \nto be equivalent in terms of improvement in \nsymptoms, albeit with confidence intervals that \nincluded differences seen at earlier time points \n(Figure 8 comparison 03:01:07: MD 0.60, 95% \nCI \u20133.55 to 4.75, p = 0.78). The narrowing of the \ndifference reflected better scores in the TUNA \ngroup. This should be interpreted cautiously as \nthis follow-up included 33% of those who initially \nunderwent surgery and so could reflect selection \nbias. \nData for other follow-up times (2 and 3 years) were \nalso reported by Hill and colleagues144 and can be \nseen in Appendix 8.3, Table 52 and the respective \nforest plots in Figure 8. \nComplications\nData describing complications are tabulated in \nAppendix 8.3, Table 53. Information on nine \ncategories of complications was identified across \nthe four eligible studies for this comparison. The \ndata were too few to provide precise estimates of \ndifferences and all confidence intervals were wide \nsuch that clinically important differences could not \nbe ruled out. Results regarding blood transfusion, \nurinary retention, urinary tract infection, strictures \nand urinary incontinence are presented in this \nsection (Figure 9).

Four patients (2.6%) who \nunderwent TURP exhibited urinary retention. The \nconfidence intervals are wide and, therefore, this \nresult should be interpreted with caution (Figure 9, \ncomparison 03:03:02: RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.49\u20134.52, \np = 0.49).\nUrinary tract infection\nUrinary tract infection occurred more frequently \nin the TUNA arms (10.2%) than in the TURP arms \n(7.0%), but again with wide confidence intervals \n(Figure 9, comparison 03:03:03 RR 1.42, 95% CI \n0.69\u20132.91, p = 0.34).\nStricture\nAcross three trials, the incidence of strictures or \nbladder neck contractures was documented in one \npatient (0.5%) in the TUNA group and 13 (6.8%) \nin the TURP group. This difference was statistically \nsignificant (Figure 9, comparison 03:04: RR 0.14, \n95% CI 0.03\u20130.62, p = 0.009).\nTUR syndrome\nNo studies reported this outcome.\nUrinary incontinence\nAll four studies reported urinary incontinence \nfollowing surgery. The types of incontinence \nwere not fully described across studies (Appendix \n8.3, Table 53). The overall incidence of urinary \nincontinence was 0.9% (n = 2) in the TUNA group \nversus 8.0% (n = 17) in the TURP group (Figure 9, \ncomparison 03:03:05: RR 0.16 95% CI 0.05\u20130.51, \np = 0.002).\nQuality of life\nFour studies,144,151,175,176 using a variety of \ninstruments, reported the quality of life of people \nfollowing TUNA or TURP (Appendix 8.3, Table \n54). In three studies151,175,176 the quality of life was \nassessed using the IPSS QoL (0\u20136) questionnaire. \nIn one study144 the type of scale used to measure \nquality of life was unclear. \nAt 3 months\nTwo studies151,175 provided details on quality of \nlife at 3 months after surgery. Only one study175 \nprovided data that were amenable to meta-analysis. \nQuality of life was higher for TURP with a mean \ndifference of 0.20 (95% CI \u20130.10 to 0.50, p = 0.19). \nThis result was not statistically significant (Figure \n10, comparison 03:08:01). This result should \nbe treated with caution as the total number of \nparticipants available for this evaluation was \nunclear. This result is, however, consistent with that \nprovided by Kim and colleagues.151\nAt 12 months\nThree studies144,151,176 provided details on quality of \nlife at 12 months after surgery; however, only one \nwas suitable for quantitative synthesis. The quality \nof life was higher for TURP with a WMD of 0.60 \n(Figure 10, comparison 03:08:02: 95% CI \u20131.08 to \n2.28, p = 0.48). This result is consistent with those \nreported by Hindley and colleagues176 and Kim and \ncolleagues.151\nLonger-term follow-up\nEvidence from one study144 indicated that the \nquality of life of patients who underwent both \nTUNA and TURP decreased over time; however, \nit remained statistically significantly better \ncompared with quality of life measured at baseline \n(p < 0.0001). Up to 5 years the two procedures \nappear to be comparable in terms of quality of life \n(Figure 10, comparison 03:08:03\u201303:08:07). The \nloss to follow-up is high and caution should be \ntaken when interpreting the results of this meta-\nanalysis.\nUrodynamic outcomes\nData on peak urine flow rate, residual volume, \ndetrusor pressure and prostate size were reported \nto a varying extent across four studies.144,151,175,176 \nThese are tabulated in Appendix 8.3, Table 55. \nOnly peak urine flow rate is presented in this \nsection. Results for the other urodynamic outcomes \nare presented in Appendix 8.3, Table 55 and \nAppendix 9.3, comparisons 03:04\u201303:07.\nPeak urine flow rate was statistically significantly \nlower in the TUNA arm than in the TURP arm at \nall time points (Appendix 9.3, comparison 03:04). \nAt 12 months there was evidence of statistical \nheterogeneity in the results; however, the direction \nof effect is consistent across the two studies \nreporting data amenable to meta-analysis144,176 and \nwith the results reported by Kim and colleagues.151 \nApplying a random-effects model did not change Clinical effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques\n46\nReview:  BPE\nComparison:  03 TUNA vs TURP\nOutcome:  08 Quality of life\nStudy or \nsubcategory n\nTUNA\nMean (SD) n\nTURP\nMean (SD)\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\n013months\nCimentepe, 2003\n175 16 2.10 (0.50) 33 1.90 (0.50) 100.00 0.20 (\u22120.10 to 0.50)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 16 33 100.00 0.20 (\u22120.10 to 0.50)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.31 (p = 0.19)\n02 12 months\nHill, 2004\n144 55 4.30 (3.70) 45 3.70 (4.69) 100.00 0.60 (\u22121.08 to 2.28)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 55 45 100.00 0.60 (\u22121.08 to 2.28)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.70 (p = 0.48)\n03 18 months\nHill, 2004\n144 26 1.80 (1.30) 33 1.70 (0.50) 100.00 0.10 (\u22120.43 to 0.63)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 26 33 100.00 0.10 (\u22120.43 to 0.63)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.37 (p = 0.71)\n042years\nHill, 2004\n144 43 4.30 (4.59) 33 3.70 (4.02) 100.00 0.60 (\u22121.34 to 2.54)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 43 33 100.00 0.60 (\u22121.34 to 2.54)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.61 (p = 0.54)\n053years\nHill, 2004\n144 40 5.40 (4.42) 32 4.70 (5.60) 100.00 0.70 (\u22121.68 to 3.08)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 40 32 100.00 0.70 (\u22121.68 to 3.08)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.58 (p = 0.56)\n064years\nHill, 2004\n144 22 5.20 (4.22) 21 3.70 (4.58) 100.00 1.50 (\u22121.14 to 4.14)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 22 21 100.00 1.50 (\u22121.14 to 4.14)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.12 (p = 0.26)\n075years\nHill, 2004\n144 18 4.30 (3.39) 22 3.80 (3.28) 100.00 0.50 (\u22121.58 to 2.58)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 18 22 100.00 0.50 (\u22121.58 to 2.58)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.47 (p = 0.64)\n\u221210 \u22125  0  5  10\n Favours TUNA  Favours TURP\nFIGURE 10  Quality of life, TUNA vs TURP .\nthis pattern.

Thus, these results should be treated \nwith considerable caution.\nDescriptors of care\nData describing descriptors of care are tabulated in \nAppendix 8.3, Table 56.

All rights reserved.\n47\nDuration of operation\nTwo studies151,175 provided information on the \nduration of operation (Appendix 8.3, Table 56). \nOnly one study provided data that were suitable for \nquantitative synthesis. The duration of operation \nin the TUNA group was on average 11.60 minutes \nlonger than the duration of operation in the TURP \ngroup (Appendix 9.3, comparison 03:09: 95% CI \n6.41\u201316.79, p < 0.001). This result was consistent \nwith that reported by Kim and colleagues151 who \nreported that TUNA took 14 minutes more than \nTURP. \nLength of hospital stay\nLength of hospital stay appeared to be longer \nfor patients undergoing TUNA than for those \nundergoing TURP in two studies. Hindley and \ncolleagues176 reported that patients undergoing \nTUNA are discharged a few days following the \nprocedure whereas patients undergoing TURP \nare discharged in the first postoperative day. \nCimentepe and colleagues175 treated TURP \npatients as outpatients whereas patients allocated \nto TUNA would stay for at least 48 hours. On \nthe other hand, Kim and colleagues151 reported a \nshorter length of hospital stay for those patients \nundergoing TUNA, with a mean difference of 5.2 \ndays.\nReoperation\nAcross the four trials, reoperations were \ndocumented in 6.2% (13\/211) of patients allocated \nto TUNA compared with 0.5% (1\/212) of patients \nin the TURP group (RR 6.89, 95% CI 1.58\u201329.95). \nAlthough the difference is statistically significant, \nthe confidence interval is wide and it should be \nnoted that the follow-up of the three eligible \nstudies varied from 12 months144,151 to 2 years.176\nSummary and conclusions \nof the evidence for and \nagainst the intervention\nThis review considered data from four RCTs of \nmoderate quality. A total of 450 participants were \nrandomised across the four studies and therefore \nthe data were too few to provide precise estimates \nfor all of the outcomes. A summary of the clinical \neffect sizes for all outcomes derived from the meta-\nanalyses for which data were available is given in \nTable 11. \nStents versus transurethral \nresection of the \nprostate (TURP)\nCharacteristics of included studies\nNo full-text reports of RCTs were identified in the \nsearches. One abstract of an RCT presented as a \nconference proceeding was identified.91 This UK \nstudy allocated 34 men to undergo prostatic stent \ninsertion and 26 to undergo TURP. \nThe mean age of participants allocated to stent \ninsertion was 73 years (range 63\u201386) compared \nwith 72.6 years (range 63\u201386) for patients allocated \nto TURP.\nOn average, participants in the TURP arm had \nmore severe symptoms (mean = 21.6) than those in \nthe stents arm (mean = 19.0). \nParticipants in both arms presented equivalent \nmean peak urine flow rate measurements of \n8.0 ml\/s. \nAssessment of effectiveness\nSymptom scores\nAt 3 months\nThe mean IPSS scores observed at 3 months were \n11.2 and 11.0 in the stents and TURP groups \nrespectively.\nComplications\nThe stents group exhibited a slight increase in \nirritative urinary symptoms compared with the \nTURP group. \nUrodynamic outcomes\nThe only uroflowmetry data reported were peak \nurine flow rate. There was no statistically significant \ndifference between the use of a Urolume stent and \nTURP (MD 0.00, 95% CI \u20135.84 to 5.84, p = 1.00).\nDescriptors of care\nThe only descriptor of care observed was two \nreoperations in the stents group because of \nmisplacement of the Urolume stent. The authors \ndescribe this as being due to technical reasons and \ntherefore a TURP procedure was carried out.Clinical effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques\n48\nTABLE 11  Summary of the clinical effect sizes from meta-analyses, TUNA vs TURP\nOutcome\nNumber of trials \nMA (total) Effect size 95% CI p-value\nIPSS\/AUA score\n3 months 2 (3) 1.18a \u20130.03 to 2.40 0.06\n12 months 1 (3) 3.90a 1.27\u20136.53 0.004\nLonger term 1 (1) 0.60a \u20133.55 to 4.75 0.78\nBlood transfusion 3 (3) 0.05b 0.01\u20130.32 0.002\nUrinary retention 3 (3) 1.48b 0.49\u20134.52 0.49\nUrinary tract infection 3 (3) 1.42b 0.69\u20132.91 0.34\nStricture 3 (3) 0.14b 0.03\u20130.62 0.009\nTUR syndrome 0 (0) NR NR NR\nIncontinence 4 (4) 0.16b 0.05\u20130.51 0.002\nQuality of life\n3 months 1 (2) 0.20a \u20130.10 to 0.50 0.19\n12 months 1 (3) 0.60a \u20131.08 to 2.28 0.48\nLonger term 1 (1) 0.50a \u20131.58 to 2.58 0.64\nQmax\n3 months 1 (2) \u20136.40a \u20138.90 to \u20133.90 < 0.001\n12 months 2 (3) \u20138.12a \u201310.85 to \u20135.40 < 0.001\nLonger term 1 (1) \u20137.20a \u201312.28 to \u20132.12 0.005\nDuration of operation 1 (2) 11.60a 6.41\u201316.79 < 0.001\nLength of hospital stay 0 (3) NR NR NR\nReoperation 4 (4) 6.89b 1.58\u201329.95 0.01\nIPSS\/AUA, International Prostate Symptom Score\/American Urological Association; MA, meta-analysed; NR, not reported; \nTUNA, transurethral needle ablation; TUR, transurethral resection; TURP , transurethral resection of the prostate.\na  Weighted mean difference.\nb  Relative risk.\nTransurethral ethanol \nablation of the prostate \n(TEAP) versus TURP\nCharacteristics of included studies\nOne RCT was identified.151 In this Korean study, 94 \nmen were allocated to undergo TEAP and 110 to \nundergo TURP. \nThe mean age of participants allocated to TEAP \nwas 66 years (range 49\u201388) compared with 67 years \n(range 60\u201387) for patients allocated to TURP.\nAll participants had severe symptoms and the mean \nor median peak urine flow rate measurements were \n7.2 and 11.9 ml\/s for the TEAP and TURP groups \nrespectively.

This difference was \nnot statistically significant (Figure 11, comparison \n26:01:02: RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.10\u20132.87, p = 0.47).\nUrinary tract infection\nNo statistically significant difference was observed \nbetween the two arms in terms of urinary tract \ninfections (Figure 11, comparison 26:01:03: RR \n0.77, 95% CI 0.25\u20132.34, p = 0.64).\nStricture\nThere were no cases of strictures or bladder neck \nstenosis in the TEAP arm as opposed to seven \ncases (7%) in the TURP arm. This result did not \nreach statistical significance (Figure 11, comparison \n26:01:04: RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00\u20131.24, p = 0.07). \nReview:  BPE\nComparison:  26 TEAP vs TURP\nOutcome:  01 Complications\nStudy or \nsubcategory\nTEAP\nn\/N\nTURP\nn\/N\nRR (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nRR (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\n01 Blood transfusion\nKim, 2006a\n151 0\/94 19\/101 100.00 0.03 (0.00\u20130.45)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 94 101 100.00 0.03 (0.00\u20130.45)\nTotal events: 0 (TEAP), 19 (TURP)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 2.52 (p = 0.01)\n02 Urinary retention\nKim, 2006a\n151 2\/94 4\/101 100.00 0.54 (0.10\u20132.87)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 94 101 100.00 0.54 (0.10\u20132.87)\nTotal events: 2 (TEAP),4(TURP)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.73 (p = 0.47)\n03 Urinary tract infection\nKim, 2006a\n151 5\/94 7\/101 100.00 0.77 (0.25\u20132.34)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 94 101 100.00 0.77 (0.25\u20132.34)\nTotal events: 5 (TEAP),7(TURP)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.47 (p = 0.64)\n04 Stricture\nKim, 2006a\n151 0\/94 7\/101 100.00 0.07 (0.00\u20131.24)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 94 101 100.00 0.07 (0.00\u20131.24)\nTotal events: 0 (TEAP),7(TURP)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.81 (p = 0.07)\n05 Urinary incontinence\nKim, 2006a\n151 0\/94 4\/101 100.00 0.12 (0.01\u20132.19)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 94 101 100.00 0.12 (0.01\u20132.19)\nTotal events: 0 (TEAP),4(TURP)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.43 (p = 0.15)\n 0.001 0.01  0.1  1  10  100 1000\nFavours TEAP Favours TURP\nFIGURE 11  Complications, TEAP vs TURPClinical effectiveness of minimally invasive techniques\n50\nUrinary incontinence\nUrinary incontinence was observed in four \npatients following TURP amongst a total of 101 \nrandomised patients. Again, this result did not \nreach statistical significance (Figure 11, comparison \n26:01:05: RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01\u20132.19, p = 0.15). \nQuality of life\nQuality of life was measured in terms of IPSS QoL \nscores and was found to be improved in both arms \nat both the 3- and 12-month assessments. Quality \nof life measurements at 3 and 12 months following \nsurgery were 3.4 and 2.3, respectively, for those \nin the TEAP arm compared with 2.8 and 2.6, \nrespectively, for those in the TURP arm.\nUrodynamic outcomes\nMean differences in peak urine flow rates at 3 and \n12 months were approximately 7.9 ml\/s in favour of \nTURP. \nDescriptors of care\nDuration of operation and length of hospital stay \nwere shorter in the TEAP arm than in the TURP \narm. No reoperations were recorded in either arm.\nLaser coagulation \nversus TURP\nLaser coagulation of the prostate is a method \nthat encompasses several techniques including \ninterstitial laser coagulation, visual laser ablation \nand transurethral laser prostatectomy. It was not \npossible to confidently describe the actual method \nused from the information available from the \ntrials. For analysis purposes these techniques have \ntherefore been considered together. \nCharacteristics of included studies\nThe characteristics of the included studies are \nsummarised in Table 12. Thirteen RCTs, reported \nin 17 papers,123,130,131,136,139,145,149,151,154,163,177\u2013179,234\u2013237 \nwere eligible for this comparison, in which a total \nof 1231 participants were randomised. The total \nnumber allocated to laser coagulation was 612 and \nthe total number allocated to TURP was 619.\nFive studies took place in the UK,136,139,145,154,179 \nthree in the US,130,163,177 and one each in \nSweden,131 Australia,123 Spain,149 Korea151 and the \nNetherlands.178 Six studies provided details on \nrecruitment dates.130,131,145,151,163,178 The earliest \nrecruitment date was August 1991163 and the latest \nrecruitment date was December 2002.151\nOverall, the total numbers of participants with \nmoderate and severe symptoms allocated to receive \nlaser coagulation were 353 (61%) and 225 (39%) \nrespectively. There were 343 (58%) moderately \nand 239 (41%) severely symptomatic participants \nallocated to TURP.\nIn general, studies reported prostate size. Two \nstudies154,179 failed to report prostate size of the \nenrolled participants and in one study149 authors \nreported that, to be included, patients had to \nhave prostate sizes between 20 and 60 g. The \ntotal numbers of participants who had small, \nmoderate-sized and large prostates in the laser \ncoagulation group were 23 (5%), 34 (8%) and 387 \n(87%) respectively. Of those allocated to a TURP \nprocedure, 22 (5%) had a small prostate, 176 (39%) \nhad a moderate-sized prostate and 214 (48%) had a \nlarge prostate.\nAssessment of effectiveness\nTables giving a detailed description for all \noutcomes can be found in Appendix 8.4. The \nresults of the meta-analyses are given in Appendix \n9.4. Note that in terms of long-term evaluation, \nonly the longest follow-up is presented.\nSymptom scores\nAt 3 months\nOf the 13 eligible RCTs, six provided information \non the mean or median IPSS\/AUA scores 3 months \nafter surgery.131,149,151,177\u2013179 Two studies149,177 showed \nbetter scores in the laser group than in the TURP \ngroup, and four131,151,178,179 favoured TURP. This \nvariation may be explained by the fact that trials \nincluded participants with various levels of prostate \nsize. For example, in the trial by Kabalin and \ncolleagues,177 participants had an average prostate \nsize of 17 g (ml) in the TURP group, whereas in \nthe study reported by M\u00e5rtenson and colleagues,178 \nparticipants randomised to TURP had on average \na prostate size of 50 ml (g). Because of this \nheterogeneity we opted not to derive a pooled \nestimate (Figure 12, comparison 04:01:01).\nAt 12 months\nIPSS\/AUA scores were reported in a total of seven \nstudies.131,145,151,163,177\u2013179 The direction and size of \neffect varied across the studies. The improvements \nin IPSS reported by Cowles and colleagues163 \nand Liedberg and colleagues131 were, however, \nconsistently lower in the laser coagulation \nintervention group (Figure 12, comparison \n04:01:03).Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Note that three trials had particularly \nhigh rates of infection and that two and three \nof the infections in the laser and TURP groups, \nrespectively, were actually epididymitis. These \nresults should also be treated with caution as the \nlength of follow-up of the RCTs varied.\nStricture\nIn five RCTs with data,123,131,151,163,177 a total of \ntwo (0.9%) strictures were reported amongst 212 \nparticipants allocated to laser procedures versus 19 \n(8.6%) strictures amongst 220 participants allocated \nto TURP procedures (Figure 13, comparison \n04:02:04: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06\u20130.56, p = 0.003).\nTUR syndrome\nBased on data from three trials154,163,177 the \nincidence of TUR syndrome after laser coagulation \nand TURP was 0% (0\/143) and 3.4% (5\/145) \nrespectively; however, this difference was not \nstatistically significant (Figure 13, comparison \n04:02:05: RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.04\u20131.34, p = 0.10).\nIncontinence\nA total of five studies130,151,154,163,178 reported urinary \nincontinence. The rates of incontinence were \nconsistently lower following laser coagulation than \nfollowing TURP (Figure 13, comparison 04:02:06: \n0\/284 versus 11\/283; RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.71, \np = 0.02).\nQuality of life\nSix studies,130,136,139,151,154,178 using a variety of \ninstruments, reported the quality of life of people \nfollowing laser coagulation or TURP (Appendix \n8.4, Table 59). In four studies136,139,151,154 the quality \nof life was assessed using the IPSS QoL (0\u20136) \nquestionnaire. In one study130 the AUA quality of \nlife questionnaire was used and another study178 \nused the quality of life index.\nIn three studies providing data,130,151,178 the \nquality of life scores were poorer following \nlaser coagulation than following TURP at 3, 12 \nand 24 months (Figure 14, comparison 04:10). \nMeta-analysis of the change of quality of life \nfrom baseline reported in three trials136,139,154 \nwas consistent with this although the difference \nbetween the groups was not statistically significant \n(Figure 14, comparison 04:11).\nUrodynamic outcomes\nData on peak urine flow rate, total voided \nvolume, residual volume, detrusor pressure \nand prostate size were reported across ten \nstudies.130,131,139,145,149,151,163,177\u2013179 These are tabulated \nin Appendix 8.4, Table 60. Only peak urine flow \nrate is presented in this section. Results for the \nother urodynamic outcomes are presented in \nAppendix 9.4, comparisons 04:04\u201304:08.\nAt 3 months\nAll eight studies that provided information on \npeak urine flow rates at 3 months after operation \nreported lower mean or median flow rates in the \nlaser coagulation group (Appendix 8.4, Table 60). \nMeta-analysis of five RCTs145,149,177\u2013179 reporting data \nsuitable for quantitative synthesis gave a WMD \nof \u20135.36 ml\/s (95% CI \u20137.28 to \u20133.45, p < 0.001) \nfavouring TURP. This result should be treated with \ncaution as two studies failed to report how many \npatients contributed to the analysis.\nAt 12 months\nA total of six studies131,145,163,177\u2013179 provided \ndetails on peak urine flow rate at 12 months after \noperation. All but one study177 reported higher \nmedian or mean peak urine flow rates in the TURP \ngroup. In the four studies145,177\u2013179 that presented \nmeans and standard deviations, the WMD was \n\u20134.57 ml\/s (Appendix 9.4, comparison 04:04:03: \n95% CI \u20136.55 to \u20132.59, p < 0.001). There was \nevidence of statistical heterogeneity amongst the \nstudies included in the meta-analysis. Using a \nrandom-effects model did not change this result. \nCowles and colleagues163 reported change from \nbaseline rather than absolute rates. Their results \nwere consistent with those of the meta-analysis. \nLonger-term follow-up\nTwo studies177,178 reported peak urine flow rates at \n2 years after laser coagulation and TURP.

The \nresults of the meta-analysis showed a statistically \nsignificant higher rate following laser coagulation \n(Appendix 9.4, comparison 04:02:16: RR 3.21, \n95% CI 1.65\u20136.24, p < 0.001). As the length of \nfollow-up ranged from 6 months123 to 5 years,145 the \nresults of this meta-analysis should be treated with \ncaution.\nSummary and conclusions \nof the evidence for and \nagainst the intervention\nData from over 1000 participants randomised \nacross 13 RCTs of generally moderate to poor \nquality (or reporting) were included. The data \nindicate that symptom scores at 12 months or more \nand quality of life and peak urine flow rate at 3 and \n12 months are worse after laser coagulation than \nafter TURP. The occurrence of blood transfusion, \nstrictures and urinary incontinence was lower in \nthe laser coagulation group but urinary retention \nand urinary tract infection appeared to be higher. \nTUR syndrome does not appear to differ between \nthe two approaches. In terms of descriptors of care, \nthe data suggest that duration of operation and \nlength of hospital stay are likely to be shorter after \nlaser coagulation than after TURP but that the \nreoperation rate is higher after laser coagulation \nthan after TURP.\nThe results for symptom scores, peak urine \nflow rate and duration of operation displayed \nsignificant heterogeneity. There was consistency in \nthe direction and size of effect across the studies for \nall except symptom scores. This heterogeneity may \nbe due to variations in the characteristics of the \nrandomised participants, particularly differences \nin baseline prostate size and symptom score. It \nmay also be due to differences in the specific aims \nand objectives of the trials, which led to important \ndifferences in inclusion criteria. \nClinical effect size\nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for which \ndata were available is given in Table 13.

All rights reserved.\n59\nTransurethral incision of the \nprostate (TUIP) versus TURP\nCharacteristics of included studies\nThe baseline characteristics of the included \nstudies are summarised in Table 14. A \ntotal of 871 participants were randomised \nacross 11 eligible RCTs and reported in 14 \npapers.135,149,152,157,180\u2013186,238\u2013240 The total number of \npeople allocated to TUIP was 430 and the total \nallocated to TURP was 441.\nTwo studies took place in the US,135,152 two in \nDenmark,180,183 and one each in Spain,149 Finland,157 \nSweden,181 Hong Kong,182 India,185 Israel184 \nand Poland.186 Three studies provided details \non recruitment dates,135,152,181 with the earliest \nrecruitment being January 1985152 and the latest \nAugust 1990.\nIn terms of symptom scores, two studies reported \nIPSS\/AUA scores149,186 and four reported Madsen\u2013\nIversen scores.135,152,180,181 Of the studies reporting \nIPSS\/AUA scores, 50 participants allocated to TUIP \nhad moderate symptoms of BPE and 20 had severe \nsymptoms compared with 21 with severe and 50 \nwith moderate symptoms among those allocated to \nTURP.\nAssessment of effectiveness\nTables giving a detailed description for all \noutcomes can be found in Appendix 8.5. The \nresults of the meta-analyses are given in Appendix \n9.5. Note that in terms of long-term evaluation, \nonly the longest follow-up is presented.\nSymptom scores\nAt 3 months\nOf the 11 eligible RCTs, five reported IPSS\/AUA or \nMadsen scores at 3 months, although for only one \nof these the data were reported in a way that was \npotentially amenable to analysis and there was no \nevidence of a statistically significant difference. Two \ntended to favour TUIP, one TURP and two showed \nno difference. \nAt 12 months\nData describing IPSS\/AUA scores at 12 months \nwere available for six trials but, again, only one \nprovided means and standard deviations. Again, \nno clear pattern emerged: three tended to favour \nTURP, one TUIP and two showed no difference.\nLonger-term follow-up\nLosses to follow-up were high in nearly all studies \nreporting long-term follow-up. Only one study181 \nreported Madsen scores at 5 years following \noperation. No significant differences were observed \nbetween the TUIP and TURP groups (Appendix \n8.5, Table 62). Data for other follow-up times (2 \nand 3 years) were also reported by Christensen and \ncolleagues,135 Jahnson and colleagues,181 Riehmann \nand colleagues152 and Saporta and colleagues.184 \nThese can be seen in Appendix 8.5 and the \nrespective forest plots in Appendix 9.5, comparison \n05:02. \nComplications\nData describing 18 types of complications are \ntabulated in Appendix 8.5, Table 63. Although \nsome data were estimated from the reports of ten \ntrials, data describing individual complications \nwere available from more than half of the 11 \ntrials for only five of the 18 complications. The \nreliability and usefulness of data for the other 13 \nwere therefore very limited. Results regarding \nblood transfusion, urinary retention, urinary tract \ninfection, strictures, TUR syndrome and urinary \nincontinence are presented in this section (Figure \n15). Results for other complications are presented \nin Appendix 9.5, comparison 05:03. The results of \nthese meta-analyses should be treated with caution \nas the length of follow-up of the RCTs varied. For \nurinary incontinence it was unclear if the type of \nincontinence considered was the same across all \nstudies.\nBlood transfusion\nSeven studies149,157,180\u2013183,185 provided information \non blood transfusions. There were fewer blood \ntransfusions following TUIP in all except one trial, \nwhich reported no transfusions in either group \nChapter 7  \nClinical effectiveness of  \ntransurethral incision of the prostateClinical effectiveness of transurethral incision of the prostate\n60\nTABLE 14  Summary of the baseline characteristics, TUIP vs TURP\nStudy Comparators\nNumber of \nparticipants\nAge \n(years)\nSymptom \nscorea\nQmax \n(ml\/s)\nResidual \nvolume \n(ml)\nProstate \nsize  \n(ml)\nRodrigo Aliaga et \nal., 1998149\nTUIP 20 NR 24.2 8.7 89 20\u201360b\nTURP 21 NR 24.4 8.3 146 20\u201360b\nChristensen et al., \n1990135\nTUIP 38 63c 16d 7.8 NR \u2264 20\nTURP 38 62c 16d 9.7 NR \u2264 20\nD\u00f8rflinger et al., \n1992180\nTUIP 29 69 15d 10 NR \u2264 20\nTURP 31 71 15d 8 NR \u2264 20\nHellstr\u00f6m et al., \n1986157\nTUIP 11 63 NR 8.6 62 \u2264 30\nTURP 13 59 NR 7.5 43 \u2264 30\nJahnson et al., \n1998181\nTUIP 42 71 15.8d 8.5 109 20\u201340\nTURP 43 70 15.4d 9.0 139 20\u201340\nLi and Ng, 1987182 TUIP 29 65 NR NR NR \u2264 30\nTURP 30 70 NR NR NR \u2264 30\nNielsen, 1988183 TUIP 25 73c NR 5c NR NR\nTUIP 24 69c NR 5c NR NR\nRiehmann et al., \n1995152\nTUIP 56 64 15.0d 11 NR NR\nTURP 61 65 15.5d 9 NR NR\nSaporta et al., \n1996184\nTUIP 20 66.8 NR NR NR \u2265 40\nTURP 20 71.4 NR NR NR \u2265 40\nSoonawalla and \nPardanani, 1992185\nTUIP 110 65.0 NR NR NR NR\nTURP 110 62.2 NR NR NR NR\nTkocz and Prajsner, \n2002186\nTUIP 50 63 17.1 7.6 75 27.0\nTURP 50 63 17.1 6.9 68 28.2\nNR, not reported; TUIP , transurethral incision of the prostate; TURP , transurethral resection of the prostate.\nData given as mean values (unless otherwise stated).\na  Symptom scores given as IPSS\/AUA (unless stated otherwise).\nb  Grams\nc  Median. \nd  Madsen score.\n(Figure 15, comparison 05:03:01: 3\/266 (11%) \nversus 77\/272 (28%), RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03\u20130.16, \np < 0.001), reflecting particularly high rates of \ntransfusion following TURP in four trials. \nUrinary retention\nMeta-analysis of data from four trials181\u2013183,185 \nreporting urinary retention showed no statistically \nsignificant difference between the TUIP and TURP \ngroups and wide confidence intervals (Figure 15, \ncomparison 05:03:02: 10\/206 versus 5\/207, RR \n1.84, 95% CI 0.70\u20134.86, p = 0.22).

On the \nother hand, 6.4% of the patients (all in one trial) \nallocated to TURP had TUR syndrome (Figure 15, \ncomparison 05:03:05: 0\/139 versus 7\/140, RR 0.07, \n95% CI 0.00\u20131.15, p = 0.06).\nUrinary incontinence\nMeta-analysis of three trials that reported urinary \nincontinence showed no statistically significant \ndifference between the TUIP and the TURP groups \neven though there were fewer events in the TUIP \ngroup (Figure 15, comparison 05:03:06: 3\/163 \nversus 7\/165, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.14\u20131.65, p = 0.24). \nThis result should be interpreted with caution \nas the length of follow-up varied, the types of \nincontinence were not fully described across studies \nand the confidence interval is wide. \nQuality of life\nOnly one study186 reported quality of life of patients \nfollowing surgery using the IPSS QoL (0\u20136) \nquestionnaire. At 2 years, quality of life appeared \nto be marginally higher for those patients who \nunderwent TURP (Appendix 9.5, comparison \n05:08:01: WMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.39, p = 0.04).\nUrodynamic outcomes\nData on peak urine flow rate, mean urine flow rate, \ntotal voided volume, residual volume and detrusor \npressure were reported to a varying extent across \neleven studies.135,149,152,157,180\u2013186 These are tabulated \nin Appendix 8.5, Table 65. Only peak urine flow \nrate is presented in this section. Results for the \nother urodynamic outcomes are presented in \nAppendix 9.5, comparisons 05:05\u201305:07.\nAt 3 months\nNine studies135,149,152,157,180\u2013183,185 provided peak urine \nflow rate measurements at 3 months for patients \ntreated with TUIP and TURP (Appendix 8.5, Table \n65). Seven studies135,152,157,180,181,183,185 showed that \npatients in the TURP group achieved a higher \nmean or median peak urine flow rate than patients \nin the TUIP group, and two studies149,182 showed \na higher value in the TUIP group. Only three \nRCTs149,157,182 presented data that were sufficiently \nsimilar to allow quantitative synthesis (Appendix \n9.5, comparison 05:05:01). Meta-analysis showed \nno statistically significant difference between the \ngroups (WMD \u20130.07 ml\/s, 95% CI \u20133.53 to 3.39, \np = 0.97).\nAt 12 months\nAll six studies135,180,181,183\u2013185 that provided \ninformation on the mean or median peak urine \nflow rate for patients 12 months after surgery \nreported lower mean or median peak urine flow \nrates following TUIP (Appendix 8.5, Table 65). \nOnly one study184 reported data that were suitable \nfor analysis (Appendix 9.5, comparison 05:05:03: \nMD \u20132.71 ml\/s, 95% CI \u20135.77 to 0.35, p = 0.08).\nLonger-term follow-up\nTwo studies152,181 provided 5-year results. A total of \n26 and 32 patients were available for analysis in \nthe TUIP and TURP groups respectively. In both \nstudies the mean peak flow rate was lower for TUIP \nthan it was for TURP. \nDescriptors of care\nData describing descriptors of care are tabulated in \nAppendix 8.5, Table 66. Information on duration of \noperation, length of hospital stay and reoperation \nrates was identified to a varying extent across the \n11 eligible studies for this comparison.\nDuration of operation\nSeven studies152,157,180\u2013183,185 provided information on \nthe duration of operation (Appendix 8.5, Table 66). \nIn all studies the duration of operation was shorter \nin the TUIP group. Only two studies157,182 presented \ndata in a sufficiently similar form to allow \nquantitative synthesis (Appendix 9.5, comparison \n05:09]; a TUIP procedure was 18.9 minutes shorter \nthan TURP (95% CI \u201324.13 to \u201313.67, p < 0.001). \nThis result was consistent with the other five studies \nreporting medians.\nLength of hospital stay\nEight studies135,149,152,157,180,182,183,185 provided \ninformation on length of hospital stay (Appendix Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n63\n8.5, Table 66). Despite marked differences \nbetween studies in overall length of stay, in \nsix135,149,152,157,182,185 they reported it to be shorter \nfor TUIP and in two 180,183 there was no difference. \nTwo RCTs157,182 reported data that were suitable for \nsynthesis. Across them, the average length of stay \nwas significantly shorter in the TUIP group than \nin the TURP group (Appendix 9.5, comparison \n05:10: WMD \u20132.26 days, 95% CI \u20133.81 to \u20130.71, \np = 0.004). The within-trial differences in medians \ntended to be smaller than this.\nReoperation\nReoperations were reported in seven \ntrials.135,149,152,180,181,183,184 Reoperation was more \ncommon in the TUIP groups (17.5%) than in the \nTURP groups (9%) (Appendix 9.5, comparison \n05:04:18: RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.16\u20133.03, p = 0.01). It \nshould be noted that differences between studies in \ntiming and completeness of follow-up might have \nintroduced bias.\nSummary and conclusions \nof the evidence for and \nagainst the intervention\nThis review considered data from 871 randomised \nparticipants across 11 RCTs of moderate to poor \nquality (and reporting). There is no evidence that \nthe two interventions are different in terms of \nsymptomatic outcome as no clear pattern emerged. \nThe data indicate that, after TUIP, improvements \nin peak urine flow rate and quality of life are \nlower than after TURP, whereas the rate of blood \ntransfusion and occurrence of TUR syndrome \nare higher after TURP than after TUIP. Urinary \nretention, urinary tract infection, strictures and \nincontinence do not appear to differ between the \ntwo approaches, although clinically important \ndifferences could not be ruled out. TUIP appears \nto be associated with shorter duration of operation \nand length of hospital stay but the reoperation \nrate is higher. It is important to note that the \nlatest recruitment date was August 1990 and so \nthe TURP outcomes then and now would not be \ncomparable given the improvements in TURP \ntechnology over the past 16 years, reflected best by \nthe higher transfusion rates reported in the seven \ntrials included in this review of TUIP versus TURP. \nClinical effect size\nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for which \ndata were available is given in Table 15.

All rights reserved.\n67\nstudies. These data are difficult to interpret. For \nseven of the complications, data were only available \nfor one or two trials. Even for those complications \nmore consistently reported, confidence intervals \nare wide and tend to include clinically important \ndifferences. Furthermore, the length of follow-\nup varied across the trials. Results regarding \nblood transfusion, urinary retention, urinary tract \ninfection, strictures, TUR syndrome and urinary \nincontinence are presented in this section (Figure \n17). Results for other complications are presented \nin Appendix 9.6, comparison 06:02.\nBlood transfusion\nIn a meta-analysis of five studies64,187\u2013189,248 patients \nallocated to laser resection were less likely to have \na blood transfusion than those allocated to TURP \n(Figure 17, comparison 06:02:01: 1\/293 versus \n9\/287, RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07\u20130.95, p = 0.04).\nUrinary retention\nAll five studies provided details on the incidence \nof urinary retention after surgery. There were \n15 (5.1%) reports of urinary retention amongst \n293 participants allocated laser resections versus \n21 (7.3%) amongst 287 participants allocated to \nTURP. The direction of effect varied across studies \nand the difference was not statistically significant \n(Figure 17, comparison 06:02:02: RR 0.71, 95% CI \n0.38\u20131.32, p = 0.28).\nUrinary tract infection\nThere were five reports of urinary tract infection in \neach arm across two studies.189,248 The direction of \neffect varied and the difference was not statistically \nsignificant (Figure 17, comparison 06:02:03: 5\/91 \nversus 5\/89, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.31\u20133.09, p = 0.97).\nStricture\nStrictures were reported in all five studies. There \nwere no statistically significant differences between \nthe two arms in terms of the incidence of strictures \nafter surgery (Figure 17, comparison 06:02:04: \n15\/287 versus 17\/273, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.43\u20131.65, \np = 0.61).\nTUR syndrome\nOut of the five eligible studies, only one reported \nTUR syndrome. There were no cases of a TUR \nsyndrome amongst 52 patients randomised to laser \nresection. In the TURP arm, one event (2%) was \nrecorded amongst 48 randomised patients (Figure \n17, comparison 06:02:05: RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01\u2013\n7.39, p = 0.47).\nUrinary incontinence\nMeta-analysis of four trials64,187\u2013189 showed no \ndifference in the risk of developing urinary \nincontinence following laser resection compared \nwith the risk for those allocated to TURP (Figure \n17, comparison 06:02:06: 55\/252 versus 54\/253, \nRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72\u20131.31, p = 0.83). This result \nshould be interpreted with caution as the length of \nfollow-up varied and the type of incontinence was \nnot fully described across studies.\nQuality of life\nThree studies134,188,189 reported quality of life of \npatients following surgery. The quality of life was \nassessed using the IPSS QoL (0\u20136) questionnaire \n(Figure 18).\nAt 3 months\nMeta-analysis of data from two studies134,189 showed \nno statistically significant difference between \nholmium laser resection and TURP (Figure 18, \ncomparison 06:08:01: WMD \u20130.19, 95% CI \u20130.68 \nto 0.30, p = 0.45).\nAt 12 months\nAt 12 months, evidence from three studies134,188,189 \nshowed marked heterogeneity present in the \nmeta-analysis and the direction of effect was not \nconsistent. In two studies the total number of \nparticipants available for quality of life evaluation \nwas unclear and therefore this result should be \ntreated with further caution. \nLonger-term follow-up\nBased on only one trial,189 quality of life appeared \nto be similar in the laser group when compared \nwith TURP at 2 and 4 years after surgery (Figure \n18, comparison 06:08:06).

Information \non duration of operation, length of hospital stay \nand reoperation rates was identified across five \neligible studies for this comparison.\nDuration of operation\nThe duration of a laser resection intervention was \nfound to be on average 17 minutes longer than a \nTURP intervention (Appendix 9.6, comparison \n06:10: 95% CI 13.45\u201320.47, p < 0.001). The \ndirection and size of effect were consistent across \nstudies.\nLength of hospital stay\nAcross the five studies the average length of stay \nwas significantly shorter in the laser resection \ngroup than in the TURP group (Appendix 9.6, \ncomparison 06:11: WMD \u20131.05 days, 95% CI \u20131.20 \nto \u20130.89, p < 0.001). The direction and size of effect \nwere also consistent across studies.\nReoperation \nReoperations were reported in four trials.64,188,189,248 \nNo statistically significant differences were \nobserved (Appendix 9.6, comparison 06:02:12: \n10\/231 versus 15\/232, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.32\u20131.44, \np = 0.31).\nSummary and conclusions of the evidence \nfor and against the intervention\nFive RCTs of moderate quality involving 580 \nparticipants were available to compare laser \nresection with TURP. In terms of symptom scores, \nlaser resection appeared to be better than TURP; \nhowever, this difference was only statistically \nsignificant at 12 months when a complete data \nset involving all 580 participants was available. \nThe data also indicate that peak urine flow rate \nwas better after laser resection than after TURP \nat 3 and 12 months after the interventions. \nAlthough these results are statistically significant, \nthe difference is small and therefore may not be \nclinically relevant. The rate of blood transfusion for \nlaser resection was lower. The occurrence of urinary \nretention, urinary tract infection, stricture, TUR \nsyndrome, urinary incontinence and reoperation \nwas similar but with wide confidence intervals. \nQuality of life does not appear to differ between \nthe two groups and there is good evidence that \nlaser resection is associated with longer duration of \noperation but shorter length of hospital stay. \nClinical effect size\nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for which \ndata were available is given in Table 17. These \nshould be interpreted in view of the comments \nmentioned earlier in this chapter.\nLaser vaporisation versus TURP\nCharacteristics of included studies\nThe baseline characteristics of the included \nstudies are summarised in Table 18.

The results of these meta-\nanalyses should be treated with caution as the \nlength of follow-up of the RCTs varied.\nBlood transfusion\nIn the ten studies127,141,146,148,153,164,190\u2013193 that reported \nblood transfusion there was only one transfusion \namongst 374 laser patients versus 24 amongst 415 \nTURP patients (Figure 20, comparison 07:02:01: \nRR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05\u20130.42, p = 0.0004).\nUrinary retention\nIn six studies 127,146,164,190,191,193 a total of 32 (10.5%) \ncases of urinary retention amongst 304 patients \nallocated to laser vaporisation versus 11 (3.6%) \ncases amongst 306 TURP patients were reported \n(Figure 20, comparison 07:02:02: RR 2.89, 95% CI \n1.55\u20135.42, p = 0.0009). \nUrinary tract infection\nMeta-analysis of data from four studies127,153,164,193 \nindicated fewer episodes of urinary tract infection \nfollowing TURP with an RR of 1.63 (95% CI \n0.99\u20132.69, p = 0.05). However, this result depends \nentirely on data from the study by Carter and \ncolleagues,127 as epididymitis and prostatitis are \nreported as well as simple urinary tract infections \nthat occurred in the early postoperative period. \nWhen only epididymitis and prostatitis are \nconsidered, the difference in rates observed in the \nlaser vaporisation and TURP groups is no longer \nstatistically significant (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.60\u20132.26, \np = 0.32). \nStrictures\nThe incidence of strictures for those who \nunderwent laser vaporisation and TURP was \navailable from nine studies.127,141,146,153,164,190\u2013193 The \nproportion of people who developed strictures \nappeared to be lower following laser vaporisation \nthan following TURP. The pooled RR of strictures \namong laser patients compared with TURP \npatients was 0.54 (Figure 20, comparison 07:02:04: \n13\/350 versus 27\/353, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.90, p = 0.02). \nIt should be noted that eight of the 13 strictures \nand 11 of the 27 strictures observed in the laser \nvaporisation and TURP groups, respectively, were \nactually bladder neck contractures.\nTUR syndrome\nThere were no cases of TUR syndrome amongst \n161 patients allocated to laser vaporisation \ncompared with one amongst 122 patients allocated \nto TURP (Figure 20, comparison 07:02:05: RR \n0.33, 95% CI 0.01\u20137.93, p = 0.50).\nIncontinence\nTaken together, data from five trials suggest \na higher rate of incontinence following laser \nvaporisation (Figure 20, comparison 07:02:06: \n16\/272 versus 7\/285, RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03\u20134.88, \np = 0.04). However, this result depended on a single \ntrial193 in which rates were high in both groups \nbut particularly following laser vaporisation. This \nresult should also be treated with caution because \nthe length of follow-up varied and the definition of \nincontinence was not fully described in the studies. \nQuality of life\nThree studies193,249,250 using a variety of methods \nreported quality of life of patients following surgery \n(Appendix 8.7, Table 73). In one study193 the quality \nof life was assessed using the disease-specific IPSS \nQoL (0\u20136) questionnaire. In another study249 the \ngeneric quality of life measure Medical Outcomes \nStudy 36-item Short Form Health Study (SF-36) \nwas used. In the third study250 quality of life was \nmeasured using two distinct instruments: SF-36 and \nEuroQol Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) (scored using \nthe UK tariffs).\nAt 3 months there appeared to be little change in \nquality of life as a consequence of either surgical \nintervention, irrespective of which quality of life \ntool was used.250 No differences in quality of life \nwere detected in two studies193,250 at 12 months.\nUrodynamic outcomes\nData on peak urine flow rate, mean urine flow rate, \nresidual volume, detrusor pressure and prostate \nsize were reported to a varying extent across eight \nstudies.127,146,148,153,164,190\u2013192 Only peak urine flow rate \nis presented in this section. Results for the other \nurodynamic outcomes are presented in Appendix \n8.7, Table 74 and Appendix 9.7, comparisons \n07:04\u201307:08.\nAt 3 months \nSix studies146,153,164,190\u2013192 provided details on peak \nurine flow rate for patients at 3 months after \nsurgery. Only four,146,153,164,192 however, presented \ndata that were sufficiently similar to allow \nquantitative synthesis. The WMD was 1.76 ml\/s, \nlower (worse) for laser vaporisation (Appendix \n9.7, comparison 07:04:01: 95% CI 0.57\u20132.94, \np = 0.004). This result was consistent with that \nreported by Tuhkanen and colleagues191 but not \nwith the small study reported by Mottet and \ncolleagues.190 Clinical effectiveness of other ablative techniques\n74\nReview:  BPE\nComparison:  07 Laser vaporisation vs TURP\nOutcome:  01 IPSS\/AUA\nStudy or \nsubcategory n\nLaser\nvaporisation\nMean (SD) n\nTURP\nMean (SD)\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\n013months\nKeoghane, 2000\n164 55 9.60 (7.50) 62 6.50 (5.10) 34.07 3.10 (0.75\u22125.45)\nSengor, 1996\n192 30 8.50 (4.20) 30 9.80 (3.10) 54.10 \u22121.30 (\u22123.17 to 0.57)\nSuvakovic, 1996\n197 10 9.70 (2.60) 10 12.80 (5.90) 11.82 \u22123.10 (\u22127.10 to 0.90)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 95 102 100.00 \u22120.01 (\u22121.39 to 1.36)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\u00b2 = 10.84, df = 2( p = 0.004), I\u00b2 = 81.5%\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.02 (p = 0.98)\n026months\nvan Melick, 2003a\n193 33 5.90 (5.50) 37 3.20 (2.70) 37.90 2.70 (0.63 \u2212 4.77)\nSengor, 1996\n192 30 7.80 (2.60) 30 9.30 (4.20) 51.90 \u22121.50 (\u22123.27 to 0.27)\nSuvakovic, 1996\n197 9 8.70 (5.40) 10 8.50 (3.00) 10.20 0.20 (\u22123.79 to 4.19)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 72 77 100.00 0.27 (\u22121.01 to 1.54)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\u00b2 = 9.16, df = 2( p = 0.01), I\u00b2 = 78.2%\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.41 (p = 0.68)\n03 12 months\nKeoghane, 2000\n164 52 8.87 (6.51) 60 5.77 (5.40) 27.67 3.10 (0.86\u22125.34)\nvan Melick, 2003a\n193 37 3.60 (3.40) 41 4.10 (4.80) 41.16 \u22120.50 (\u22122.33 to 1.33)\nShingleton, 2002\n146 40 6.00 (6.00) 33 3.80 (4.10) 25.54 2.20 (\u22120.13 to 4.53)\nSuvakovic, 1996\n197 9 8.70 (4.90) 10 7.20 (6.10) 5.63 1.50 (\u22123.45 to 6.45)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 138 144 100.00 1.30 (0.12\u22122.47)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\u00b2 = 6.78, df = 3( p = 0.08), I\u00b2 = 55.7%\nTest for overall effect: z = 2.16 (p = 0.03)\n042years\nKeoghane, 2000\n164 45 7.80 (6.60) 52 5.70 (6.00) 58.51 2.10 (\u22120.43 to 4.63)\nShingleton, 2002\n146 23 5.90 (5.70) 19 4.60 (4.20) 41.49 1.30 (\u22121.70 to 4.30)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 68 71 100.00 1.77 (\u22120.16 to 3.70)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\u00b2 = 0.16, df = 1( p = 0.69), I\u00b2 = 0%\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.79 (p = 0.07)\n054years\nvan Melick, 2003a\n193 10 9.30 (5.20) 15 5.80 (7.50) 100.00 3.50 (\u22121.48 to 8.48)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 10 15 100.00 3.50 (\u22121.48 to 8.48)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.38 (p = 0.17)\n065years\nKeoghane, 2000\n164 25 9.70 (7.50) 32 7.00 (5.70) 43.35 2.70 (\u22120.84 to 6.24)\nShingleton, 2002\n146 29 9.90 (6.70) 33 7.70 (5.60) 56.65 2.20 (\u22120.90 to 5.30)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 54 65 100.00 2.42 (0.08\u22124.75)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\u00b2 = 0.04, df = 1( p = 0.84), I\u00b2 = 0%\nTest for overall effect: z = 2.03 (p = 0.04)\n077years\nvan Melick, 2003a\n193 17 8.30 (6.40) 15 7.30 (7.10) 100.00 1.00 (\u22123.71 to 5.71)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 17 15 100.00 1.00 (\u22123.71 to 5.71)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.42 (p = 0.68)\n\u221210 \u22125  0  5  10\nFavours\nlaser vaporisation\n Favours TURP\nFIGURE 19  Symptom scores, laser vaporisation vs TURP .Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

With regard to the \nstudies in which data were not amenable to meta-\nanalysis, two127,148 favoured TURP and one190 \nfavoured laser vaporisation. \nLonger-term follow-up\nMeta-analysis of data from two146,164 studies \nreporting 5-year data showed no statistically \nsignificant difference between the two groups \n(Appendix 9.7, comparison 07:04:06: WMD 0.28, \n95% CI 1.76\u20132.32, p = 0.79). Loss to follow-up was \nhigh in both trials.\nDescriptors of care\nData describing descriptors of care are tabulated in \nAppendix 8.7, Table 75. Information on duration of \noperation, length of hospital stay and reoperation \nrates was identified across the eligible studies for \nthis comparison.\nDuration of operation\nA total of nine studies127,148,153,164,179,190\u2013193 provided \ninformation on duration of operation. In three \nstudies164,179,192 the mean duration of operation \nwas shorter in the laser group and in one193 there \nwere no differences between the two groups. Meta-\nanalysis of four studies with suitable data showed \na non-statistically significant difference between \nlaser vaporisation and TURP (Appendix 9.7, \ncomparison 07:11: WMD 0.29, 95% CI \u20132.19 to \n2.78, p = 0.82).\nLength of hospital stay\nLength of hospital stay was reported in eight \nstudies, with six favouring the laser vaporisation \ngroup and two favouring TURP.153,191 Only one \nstudy reported means and standard deviations141,193 \nand meta-analysis suggested that there was no \nevidence of a difference between the two groups \n(Appendix 9.7, comparison 07:12).\nReoperations\nReoperations were reported in nine \ntrials.141,146,148,153,164,190,191,193,249 Reoperation was more \ncommon in the laser vaporisation group (9.3%) \nthan in the TURP groupt (5.4%) (Appendix 9.7, \ncomparison 07:03:17: RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.97\u20132.63, \np = 0.06). It should be noted that differences \nbetween studies in timing and completeness of \nfollow-up might have introduced bias. \nSummary and conclusions of the evidence \nfor and against the intervention\nA total of 854 participants were randomised across \n11 eligible studies of generally moderate quality. \nAt 12 months or longer, the data indicated that \nsymptom scores were worse after laser vaporisation \nthan after TURP. There was a tendency for peak \nurine flow rate to favour TURP but this was only \nstatistically significant at the 3- and 12-month \nfollow-up assessments. The differences observed \nfor both symptom scores and peak urine flow \nrate, although statistically significant, may not \nbe clinically relevant or appreciable by patients. \nThe occurrence of complications such as urinary \nretention, urinary tract infection and incontinence \nwas higher for laser vaporisation than for TURP. \nHowever, blood transfusion and the incidence of \nstrictures were lower. The duration of operation \nand length of hospital stay did not appear to differ \nbetween the two approaches. \nThe results for symptom scores displayed \nsignificant heterogeneity and there was a lack of \nconsistency in the direction and size of effect across \nstudies. Much of the variation might be due to \ndifferences in the specific aims and objectives of \nthe trials. \nClinical effect size\nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for \nwhich data were available is given in Table 19. \nThese should be interpreted in view of all of the \ncomments mentioned earlier in this chapter.\nInterventions using non-\nlaser technology\nTransurethral vaporesection \nof the prostate (TUVRP) \nversus TURP\nCharacteristics of included studies\nThe characteristics of the included studies are \nsummarised in Table 20.

Results regarding blood transfusion, \nurinary retention, urinary tract infection, strictures, \nTUR syndrome and urinary incontinence are \npresented in this section (Figure 22). Results for \nother complications are presented in Appendix 9.8, \ncomparison 08:02.\nBlood transfusion\nAll five trials provided information on blood \ntransfusions.68,132,187,202,203 A total of seven (2.3%) \npatients required a blood transfusion following \nTUVRP as opposed to 12 (4.6%) patients following \nTURP (Figure 22, comparison 08:02:01: RR 0.57, \n95% CI 0.24\u20131.36, p = 0.20).\nUrinary retention\nThere were six cases of urinary retention \namongst 144 patients randomised to TUVRP \nversus seven cases of urinary retention amongst \n132 patients randomised to TURP (Figure 22, \ncomparison 08:02:02: RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.26\u20132.05, \np = 0.54).132,187,203 \nUrinary tract infection\nNo studies reported this outcome.\nStricture\nFour studies132,187,202,203 reported the incidence of \nstrictures postoperatively.

The incidence of blood \ntransfusion, urinary retention, strictures, TUR \nsyndrome and urinary incontinence was also similar \nin the two groups. The duration of operation and \nreoperation rates were also statistically similar in \nboth groups; however, length of hospital stay was \nslightly shorter for TUVRP than it was for TURP. \nClinical effect size\nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for which \ndata were available is given in Table 21.

Results \nfor the other urodynamic outcomes are presented \nin Appendix 9.9, comparisons 09:03\u201309:06.\nAt 3 months\nTwo studies161,195 provided details on peak urine \nflow rate for patients at 3 months after surgery. \nAcross them, the average peak urine flow rate in \nthe bipolar arm was not statistically significantly \ndifferent from that observed in the conventional \nTURP arm (Appendix 9.9, comparison 09:03:01: \nWMD \u20130.98, 95% CI \u20132.25 to 0.29, p = 0.13). \nAt 12 months\nThree studies161,194,195 provided details on peak \nurine flow rate for patients at 12 months after \nsurgery. There were no statistically significant \ndifferences between the two groups (Appendix 9.9, \ncomparison 09:03:03: WMD 0.01, 95% CI \u20131.10 to \n1.08, p = 0.98).

Information on duration \nof operation and reoperations was identified to a \nvarying extent across the eligible studies for this \ncomparison.\nDuration of operation\nFive studies provided information on duration \nof operation, with the results being inconsistent \n(highly significant heterogeneity). Two161,194 \nsuggested no difference between the groups \nwhereas, in another three,65,150,195 a 3-, 5- and \n17-minute difference in the mean length of \noperation, respectively, was observed, favouring \nB-TURP (Appendix 8.9, Table 85). Four studies \nprovided data that were amenable to quantitative \nsynthesis. Fitting a random-effects model resulted \nin a WMD of \u20134.56 minutes in favour of B-TURP. \nThis result was not statistically significant (95% CI \n\u201315.36 to 6.23, p = 0.41).\nLength of hospital stay\nEvidence from two studies65,150 suggests that the \naverage length of stay following B-TURP was \nshorter than the average length of stay following \nTURP. The mean difference was \u20130.7 days \n(Appendix 8.9, Table 85; Appendix 9.9, comparison \n09:10: 95% CI \u201301.37 to \u20130.03, p = 0.04).\nReoperation\nThree studies65,194,195 provided information on \nreoperation rates. No differences were observed \nbetween the two groups (Appendix 9.9, comparison \n09:02:09: 3\/111 versus 2\/112, RR 1.46, 95% CI \n0.25\u20138.57, p = 0.67). The time point of reoperation \nwas unclear and the length of follow-up across \nstudies ranged from 12 to 18 months.\nSummary and conclusions of the evidence \nfor and against the intervention\nA total of 386 participants randomised to undergo \nB-TURP or conventional TURP across six RCTs of \nmoderate to low quality were considered for this \nreview. The data were too few to provide precise \nestimates for all of the outcomes considered \nand statistically significant differences could not \nbe detected, with the exception of duration of \noperation, which bears significant heterogeneity \nand is of doubtful clinical or economic importance. \nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for which \ndata were available is given in Table 23. These \nshould be interpreted in view of the comments \nmentioned earlier in this chapter.\nBipolar transurethral \nvaporesection of the prostate \n(B-TUVRP) versus TURP\nCharacteristics of included studies\nOnly one RCT155 making this comparison was \nidentified in the searches (Table 24). This study, \nwhich was carried out in Hong Kong, allocated \n29 men to undergo B-TUVRP and 31 to undergo \nTURP. Participants in both groups appeared to \nhave moderate symptoms. No information was \navailable to judge prostate size.\nAssessment of effectiveness\nThis study reported outcomes on symptom scores, \nintraoperative and postoperative complications and \nquality of life. No urodynamic data were reported. \nThese results are tabulated in Appendix 8.10, Tables \n86\u201389.\nSymptom scores\nAt 3 months\nIPSS at 3 months were slightly better for B- \nTUVRP than for TURP. Patients in the B-TUVRP \ngroup showed a 54% improvement in mean scores \nfrom baseline compared with 39% in the TURP \narm.\nComplications\nThere was no difference in the incidence of urinary \ntract infections or clot retention after B-TUVRP \nand conventional TURP, with wide confidence \nintervals. There were no cases of TUR syndrome in \neither arm of the trial (Table 25 and Appendix 9.10, \ncomparison 10:01). \nQuality of life\nQuality of life in patients following B-TUVRP \nwas comparable to that in the TURP group at the \n3-month follow-up (Appendix 8.10, Table 88).155\nDescriptors of care\nThere was no statistically significant difference \nbetween B-TUVRP and TURP in terms of duration \nof operation or length of hospital stay (Appendix \n8.10, Table 89).\nTransurethral vaporisation of the \nprostate (TUVP) versus TURP\nCharacteristics of included studies\nThe characteristics of the included studies are \nsummarised in Table 26.

Meta-analysis of seven \nstudies55,57,138,156,162,199,200 showed no difference \nbetween TUVP and TURP in terms of symptom \nscores (Figure 25, comparison 11:01:01: WMD \n0.09, 95% CI \u20130.42 to 0.61, p = 0.72). This result is \nconsistent with the data from those trials that were \nnot amenable to meta-analysis.\nAt 12 months\nEight studies provided information on the mean or \nmedian IPSS\/AUA scores at 12 months (Appendix \n8.11, Table 90). A meta-analysis involving five \nstudies55,129,138,193,200 reporting data that were \nsuitable for synthesis again showed no statistically \nsignificant difference between the groups (Figure \n24, comparison 11:01:03: WMD 0.34, 95% CI \n\u20130.19 to 0.86, p = 0.21). This result is consistent \nwith the other three studies that were not amenable \nto meta-analysis.\nLonger-term follow-up\nData from three studies129,193,199 reporting IPSS \nscores at 5 years also showed little difference in \nsymptom scores (Figure 24, comparison 11:01:07: \nWMD \u20130.32, 95% CI \u20131.95 to 1.31, p = 0.70). \nComplications\nInformation about complications is detailed in \nAppendix 8.11, Table 91. Data describing 15 \ntypes of complications were reported to a varying \nextent across 15 studies. Results regarding blood \ntransfusion, urinary retention, urinary tract \ninfection, strictures, TUR syndrome and urinary \nincontinence are presented in this section (Figure \n26).

A total of 21 (7.0%) urinary tract \ninfections were reported amongst 298 participants \nallocated to TUVP compared with 33 (10.4%) \namongst 318 participants allocated to TURP \n(Figure 26, comparison 11:02:03: RR 0.65, 95% CI \n0.40\u20131.08, p = 0.09).\nStricture\nEvidence from 11 studies showed no statistically \nsignificant difference between TUVP and TURP \nin terms of incidence of strictures or bladder neck \ncontractures (Figure 26, comparison 11:02:04: \n12\/418 versus 14\/446, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.45\u20131.85, \np = 0.80). \nTUR syndrome\nA total of three (0.9%) patients suffered a TUR \nsyndrome following surgery amongst 314 \nrandomised to TUVP as opposed to six (1.8%) \namongst 329 patients randomised to TURP (Figure \n26, comparison 11:02:05: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.17\u2013\n2.12, p = 0.42).\nUrinary incontinence\nUrinary incontinence was reported in nine studies \n(Figure 26). Urinary incontinence occurred less \nfrequently in the TUVP arm than in the TURP \narm. This difference was not statistically significant \n(Figure 26, comparison 11:02:06: 57\/489 versus \n64\/533, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69\u20131.21, p = 0.53).\nQuality of life\nFive studies57,129,142,162,193 reported quality of life of \npatients following surgery. In three studies, quality \nof life was assessed using the IPSS QoL (0\u20136) \nquestionnaire. In the other two studies, authors did \nnot provide further information on the measure \nused and later it was assumed that it was the IPSS \nQoL. One of the studies also assessed quality of \nlife using the EQ-5D (using the UK tariff) and the \nSF-36 measures and the authors concluded that \nany change in general health-related quality of life \nresulting from their intervention was not detectable \nby either the EQ-5D or the SF-36 tools (the ranges \nand standard deviations were large).\nThere was no statistically significant difference in \nIPSS QoL at 3 or 12 months or for any longer-term \nfollow-ups between TUVP and TURP following \nsurgery (Appendix 9.11, comparison 11:10).\nUrodynamic outcomes\nData on peak urine flow rate, mean urine flow rate, \ntotal voided volume, residual volume, detrusor \npressure and prostate size were reported across 16 \nstudies.55,57,128,129,138,140,142,156,158,187,193,197\u2013201 Only peak \nurine flow rate is presented in this section. Results \nfor the other urodynamic outcomes are presented \nin Appendix 8.11, Table 93 and Appendix 9.11, \ncomparisons 11:04\u201311:09.\nAt 3 months\nA total of 12 studies55,57,128,129,138,140,156,158,187,193,199,200 \nprovided details of peak urine flow rate at 3 \nmonths after surgery. In five studies128,156,158,187,199 \nthe average peak urine flow rate was \nhigher in the TUVP group. A total of eight \nstudies55,57,138,156,158,193,199,200 presented data that were \nsufficiently similar to allow quantitative synthesis \n(Appendix 9.11, comparison 11:04:01). The WMD \nwas 0.10 ml\/s for TUVP versus TURP (95% CI \n\u20130.53 to 0.73, p = 0.76). \nAt 12 months\nNine studies55,129,138,142,193,197,198,200,201 provided details \nof mean or median peak urine flow rate at 12 \nmonths after surgery. Five of the studies55,142,197,198,201 \nreported lower rates in the TUVP group. Data \nfrom five trials55,129,193,198,200 reporting data that were \namenable to meta-analysis showed no statistically \nsignificant difference between TUVP and TURP \n(Appendix 9.11, comparison 11:04:03: WMD \n\u20130.11, 95% CI \u20130.97 to 0.74, p = 0.80).\nLonger-term follow-up\nThree studies129,193,199 reported peak urine flow rate \nmeasurements 5 years after surgery. Meta-analysis \nof data from these trials showed no statistically \nsignificant difference between the two groups \n(Appendix 9.11, comparison 11:04:06: WMD 0.60, \n95% CI \u20131.06 to 2.26, p = 0.31).\nDescriptors of care\nData describing descriptors of care are tabulated \nin Appendix 8.11, Table 94. Information on \nduration of operation, length of hospital stay and \nreoperation rates was identified to a varying extent \nacross the 17 eligible studies for this comparison.Clinical effectiveness of other ablative techniques\n90\nReview:  BPE\nComparison:  11 TUVP vs TURP\nOutcome:  01 IPSS\/AUA\nStudy or \nsubcategory n\nTUVP\nMean (SD) n\nTURP\nMean (SD)\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\n013months\nFowler, 2005\n57 105 11.80 (7.70) 110 9.80 (7.20) 6.66 2.00 (0.01\u20133.99)\nGalluci, 1998\n138 70 5.50 (4.77) 80 5.52 (4.11) 12.87 \u22120.02 (\u22121.46 to 1.42)\nGotoh, 1999\n156 23 3.70 (2.40) 28 3.80 (2.30) 15.71 \u22120.10 (\u22121.40 to 1.20)\nKaplan, 1998\n55 32 9.20 (2.70) 32 8.60 (2.50) 16.31 0.60 (\u22120.67 to 1.87)\nNathan, 1996\n162 20 2.86 (2.80) 20 3.10 (2.30) 10.51 \u22120.24 (\u22121.83 to 1.35)\nNuhoglu, 2005\n199 35 4.70 (3.10) 38 4.80 (4.20) 9.34 \u22120.10 (\u22121.78 to 1.58)\nShokeir, 1997\n200 35 4.50 (1.90) 35 4.80 (2.20) 28.59 \u22120.30 (\u22121.26 to 0.66)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 320 343 100.00 0.09 (\u22120.42 to 0.61)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 5.09, df = 6( p = 0.53), I\n2 = 0%\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.35 (p = 0.72)\n026months\nFowler, 2005\n57 106 8.50 (7.40) 108 6.90 (5.50) 6.66 1.60 (\u22120.15 to 3.35)\nGalluci, 1998\n138 70 4.94 (4.68) 80 3.77 (3.30) 11.83 1.17 (\u22120.14 to 2.48)\nKaplan, 1998\n55 32 7.40 (2.90) 32 7.90 (3.10) 9.43 \u22120.50 (\u22121.97 to 0.97)\nvan Melick, 2003a\n193 33 3.80 (2.70) 37 3.20 (2.70) 12.70 0.60 (\u22120.67 to 1.87)\nShokeir, 1997\n200 35 4.60 (1.20) 35 4.50 (1.30) 59.38 0.10 (\u22120.49 to 0.69)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 276 292 100.00 0.33 (\u22120.12 to 0.79)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 5.59, df = 4( p = 0.23), I\n2 = 28.4%\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.45 (p = 0.15)\n03 12 months\nGalluci, 1998\n138 70 4.04 (4.26) 80 3.52 (3.04) 19.24 0.52 (\u22120.68 to 1.72)\nHammadeh, 2003\n129 51 4.40 (3.80) 51 5.90 (5.20) 8.87 \u22121.50 (\u22123.27 to 0.27)\nKaplan, 1998\n55 30 6.60 (2.40) 31 6.10 (1.90) 23.38 0.50 (\u22120.59 to 1.59)\nvan Melick, 2003a\n193 34 4.80 (4.90) 41 4.10 (4.80) 5.69 0.70 (\u22121.51 to 2.91)\nShokeir, 1997\n200 25 5.20 (1.40) 25 4.70 (1.50) 42.82 0.50 (\u22120.30 to 1.30)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 210 228 100.00 0.34 (\u22120.19 to 0.86)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 4.59, df = 4( p = 0.33), I\n2 = 12.8%\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.26 (p = 0.21)\n04 18 months\nGotoh, 1999\n156 28 3.83 (4.62) 27 8.68 (2.30) 100.00 \u22124.85 (\u22126.77 to \u22122.93)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 28 27 100.00 \u22124.85 (\u22126.77 to \u22122.93)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 4.95 (P < 0.00001)\n052y ears\nFowler, 2005\n57 90 8.60 (7.20) 77 7.50 (5.80) 37.74 1.10 (\u22120.87 to 3.07)\nHammadeh, 2003\n129 47 4.30 (3.50) 47 6.30 (4.30) 58.45 \u22122.00 (\u22123.59 to \u22120.41)\nvan Melick, 2003a\n193 12 8.40 (8.70) 15 5.80 (7.50) 3.80 2.60 (\u22123.62 to 8.82)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 149 139 100.00 \u22120.66 (\u22121.87 to 0.56)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 6.86, df = 2( p = 0.03), I\n2 = 70.8%\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.06 (p = 0.29)\n063y ears\nHammadeh, 2003\n129 40 4.10 (3.30) 40 7.10 (6.20) 100.00 \u22123.00 (\u22125.18 to \u22120.82)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 40 40 100.00 \u22123.00 (\u22125.18 to \u22120.82)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 2.70 (p = 0.007)\n075y ears\nHammadeh, 2003\n129 27 5.90 (6.30) 27 8.60 (7.10) 20.71 \u22122.70 (\u22126.28 to 0.88)\nvan Melick, 2003a\n193 12 7.00 (5.60) 15 7.30 (7.10) 11.57 \u22120.30 (\u22125.09 to 4.49)\nNuhoglu, 2005\n199 21 6.50 (3.20) 23 6.10 (3.50) 67.73 0.40 (\u22121.58 to 2.38)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 60 65 100.00 \u22120.32 (\u22121.95 to 1.31)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 2.21, df = 2( p = 0.33), I\n2 = 9.3%\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.39 (p = 0.70)\n\u221210 \u22125  0  5  10\nFavours TURP  Favours TUVP \nFIGURE 25  Symptom scores, TUVP vs TURP .Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

(Appendix 8.11, \nTable 94). In half of the studies55,57,129,158,162,199,200 this \nwas longer in the TUVP group whereas in the other \nhalf140,142,156,193,196,198,201 it was shorter in the TUVP \ngroup. Eight studies presented data in a form \nsufficiently similar to allow quantitative synthesis \n(Appendix 9.11, comparison 11:11). The WMD was \n\u20131.62 minutes, favouring TUVP, although this was \nnot statistically significant (95% CI \u201312.23 to 8.99, \np = 0.76). \nLength of hospital stay\nTen studies55,57,129,138,140,162,193,197,198,200 provided \ninformation on length of hospital stay (Appendix \n8.11, Table 94). In all but two studies57,193 length of \nhospital stay was reported to be shorter for TUVP. \nIn two studies there were no differences. Eight \nRCTs55,57,129,138,193,197,198,200 reported data that were \nsuitable for synthesis. Across them, the average \nlength of stay was 1.00 day less following TUVP \n(Appendix 9.11, comparison 11:12: WMD \u20131.00, \n95% CI \u20131.25 to \u20130.75, p < 0.001).\nReoperation\nOnly seven studies129,142,162,193,197,199,270 out of a \npossible 17 reported reoperation rates. The risk \nof having a reoperation following TUVP was no \ndifferent from that following TURP. However, the \nconfidence intervals were wide enough for clinically \nimportant differences to exist between the two \ngroups (Appendix 9.11, comparison 11:03:15: \n14\/326 versus 14\/346, RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.53\u20132.07, \np = 0.90). \nSummary and conclusions of the evidence \nfor and against the intervention\nThis review considered data from 1449 randomised \nparticipants across 17 RCTs of moderate to low \nquality. The data suggest that the rates of blood \ntransfusion and urinary tract infection are lower \nand the rate of urinary retention is higher after \nTUVP than after TURP. The length of hospital \nstay for TUVP was shorter in the trials. There were \nno statistically significant differences in IPSS\/AUA \nsymptom scores, quality of life and peak urine \nflow rate at 3 or 12 months or at any longer-term \nfollow-up between TUVP and TURP. The incidence \nof complications such as strictures, TUR syndrome \nand urinary incontinence was similar. Duration \nof operation and reoperation rates also did not \nappear to differ between the two groups. \nThere was evidence of high statistical heterogeneity \nin the results for peak urine flow rate, quality of \nlife, duration of operation and length of hospital \nstay. There was no consistency in the direction of \neffect and clinically important differences could \nnot be ruled out. Much of the variation might be \ndue to differences in participants\u2019 characteristics \nor the ways in which the technologies were used. \nIn addition, differences in the specific aims \nand objectives of the studies might have led to \nimportant differences in their inclusion criteria. In \nthe case of duration of operation, the variation may \nbe explained by differences in operator experience \nand baseline prostate size, which can be considered \nas a proxy for duration of operation.\nClinical effect size\nA summary of the clinical effect sizes for all \noutcomes derived from the meta-analyses for which \ndata were available is given in Table 27. \nBipolar transurethral \nvaporisation of the prostate \n(B-TUVP) versus TURP\nCharacteristics of included studies\nOnly two RCTs making this comparison were \nidentified by the searches (Table 28).70,137,272 One \nstudy took place in Australia137,272 and the other \nin the UK.70 A total of 111 men were allocated \nto undergo B-TUVP and 100 to undergo TURP. \nParticipants in the bipolar group appeared to \nhave severe symptoms whereas 21 (21%) of those \nin the TURP group had moderate symptoms and \n79 (79%) had severe symptoms preoperatively. \nParticipants in the bipolar group had moderate-\nsized prostates whereas those in the TURP group \nhad large prostates.\nAssessment of effectiveness\nSymptom scores\nData reported in the study by Dunsmuir and \ncolleagues137,272 showed better improvement in \nmean AUA scores at 3 months for bipolar TUVP \nthan for TURP (Appendix 8.12, Table 95). In \ncontrast, Hon and colleagues70 did not find any \nstatistically significant difference between the two \ngroups at 9 months following surgery (Appendix \n9.12, comparison 12:01:01: MD 0.80, 95% CI \u20131.23 \nto 2.83, p = 0.44).\nComplications\nFour types of complication were identified, with \nno statistically significant differences between the \ngroups (Appendix 9.12, comparison 12:02).Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n93\nQuality of life\nBoth studies reported quality of life of patients \nfollowing surgery. The IPSS QoL scale was used \nin one study70 and the AUA QoL in the other.137,272 \nAUA QoL was taken from section C of the AUA7 \nsystem. It comprises five questions to give a \nmaximum score of 19. No statistically significant \ndifferences were observed between the two groups \nat 3, 9 and 12 months following surgery (Appendix \n8.12, Table 97; Appendix 9.12, comparison \n12:04:01). \nUrodynamic outcomes\nData on peak urine flow rate, mean flow rate and \nresidual volume were reported across the two \nstudies. Results for these outcomes are presented \nin Appendix 8.12, Table 98 and Appendix \n9.12, comparisons 12:05\u201312:07. No statistically \nsignificant differences were identified between the \ntwo groups. \nDescriptors of care\nData describing descriptors of care are tabulated \nin Appendix 8.12, Table 99. Information on \nduration of operation, length of hospital stay and \nreoperation rates were identified across the two \neligible studies for this comparison.\nDuration of operation\nDuration of operation was found to be longer in \nthe B-TUVP arm than in the TURP arm in the two \nstudies reporting this outcome (Appendix 8.12, \nTable 99; Appendix 9.12, comparison 12:08).\nTABLE 27  Summary of the clinical effect size from meta-analyses, TUVP vs TURP\nOutcome\nNumber of trials \nMA (total) Effect size 95% CI p-value\nIPSS\/AUA score\n3 months 7 (13) 0.09a \u20130.42 to 0.61 0.72\n12 months 5 (8) 0.34a \u20130.19 to 0.86 0.21\nLonger term 3 (3) \u20130.32a \u20131.95 to 1.31 0.70\nBlood transfusion 13 (13) 0.19b 0.08\u20130.44 < 0.001\nUrinary retention 11 (11) 2.12b 1.23\u20133.68 0.007\nUrinary tract infection 8 (8) 0.65b 0.40\u20131.08 0.09\nStricture 11 (11) 0.91b 0.45\u20131.85 0.80\nTUR syndrome 8 (8) 0.59b 0.17\u20132.12 0.42\nIncontinence 9 (9) 0.92b 0.69\u20131.21 0.53\nQuality of life\n3 months 1 (2) 0.30a \u20130.18 to 0.78 0.22\n12 months 2 (3) 0.47a \u20130.23 to 0.32 0.73\nLonger term 1 (1) \u20130.60a \u20131.30 to 0.10 0.09\nQmax\n3 months 8 (12) 0.10a \u20130.53 to 0.73 0.78\n12 months 5 (10) \u20130.11a \u20130.97 to 0.74 0.80\nLonger term 3 (3) 0.60a \u20131.06 to 2.26 0.48\nDuration of operation 8 (14) \u20131.62a \u201312.23 to 8.99 0.76\nLength of hospital stay 8 (11) \u20131.00a \u20131.25 to \u20130.75 < 0.001\nReoperation 7 (7) 1.04b 0.53\u20132.07 0.90\nIPSS\/AUA, International Prostate Symptom Score\/American Urological Association; MA, meta-analysed; TUR, transurethral \nresection of the prostate; TUVP , transurethral vaporisation of the prostate.\na  Weighted mean difference.\nb  Relative risk.Clinical effectiveness of other ablative techniques\n94\nTABLE 28  Summary of the baseline characteristics, B-TUVP vs TURP\nStudy Comparators\nNumber of \nparticipants\nAge \n(years)\nSymptom \nscorea\nQmax \n(ml\/s)\nResidual \nvolume \n(ml)\nProstate \nsize  \n(ml)\nDunsmuir et al., \n2003137,272\nB-TUVP 30 63 24 9.6 112 39\nTURP 21 60 17 10.4 96 42\nHon et al., 200670 B-TUVP 81 66 21 12 147 38\nTURP 79 68 21 12 182 40\nB-TUVP , bipolar transurethral vaporisation of the prostate; TURP , transurethral resection of the prostate.\nData given as mean values.\na  Symptom scores given as IPSS\/AUA (International Prostate Symptom Score\/American Urological Association).\nLength of hospital stay\nBoth studies reported this outcome (Appendix \n8.12, Table 99).

All rights reserved.\n95\nB\necause of the lack of RCTs comparing \nminimally invasive interventions with ablative \nmethods other than TURP, a narrative review \ninvestigating trends across the interventions \nwas performed to identify the most promising \nminimally invasive and ablative methods. For \nall comparisons considered, symptom scores \nare reported on the same forest plot (Figures 27 \nand 28). Plots for other outcomes can be seen in \nAppendix 9.14. These forest plots can be used to \nillustrate the differences between interventions. \nThere does not appear to be a clear winner in \nterms of which intervention is the most promising \nto treat BPE. Some interventions perform better \nwhen assessed in terms of one outcome than \nothers. Interpretation is difficult because of the \npaucity of data and the multitude of comparators. \nHowever, in summary, there seems to be little \nevidence that any treatment is more effective than \nTURP in terms of resolution of symptoms of BPE. \nWhat evidence there is relates to improvement in \npeak urine flow rate (laser resection better) with \ndoubtful translation to clinically significant benefit. \nSeveral procedures appear to perform better \nthan TURP, at least in terms of one measure of \ncomplications. The performance of the different \ninterventions relative to TURP is detailed in Table \n29. \nGiven that the results indicate that there are \ntrade-offs between the outcomes provided by \ndifferent treatments, patient preference becomes \nmore important. However, these choices might be \ninformed by the synthesis of the different clinical \noutcomes into a single measure, as performed in \nChapter 10. \nChapter 9  \nMost promising intervention(s) for \nbenign prostatic enlargementMost promising intervention(s) for benign prostatic enlargement\n96\nReview:  BPE\nComparison:  13 IPSS\/AUA\nOutcome:  01 3m onths\nStudy or \nsubcategory n\nIntervention\nMean (SD) n\nTURP\nMean (SD)\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\nWeight\n%\nWMD (\ufb01xed)\n95% CI\n01 TUMT vs TURP\nd\u2019Ancona, 1998\n166 31 15.10 (8.20) 21 5.10 (3.10) 16.92 10.00 (6.82\u201313.18)\nFrancisca, 2000\n213 57 10.50 (7.90) 55 5.30 (5.20) 28.01 5.20 (2.73\u20137.67)\nWagrell, 2002\n165 85 8.40 (5.50) 41 6.70 (4.30) 55.07 1.70 (\u22120.06 to 3.46)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 173 117 100.00 4.08 (2.78\u20135.39)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 21.15, df = 2( p < 0.0001), I\n2 = 90.5%\nTest for overall effect: z = 6.13 (p < 0.00001)\n02 TUNA vs TURP\nCimentepe, 2003\n175 26 9.70 (2.80) 33 8.30 (2.90) 69.22 1.40 (\u22120.06 to 2.86)\nHill, 2004\n144 59 10.10 (6.70) 47 9.40 (4.80) 30.78 0.70 (\u22121.49 to 2.89)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 85 80 100.00 1.18 (\u22120.03 to 2.40)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 0.27, df = 1( p = 0.60), I\n2 = 0%\nTest for overall effect: z = 1.91 (p = 0.06)\n03 Laser coagulation vs TURP\nAliaga, 1998\n149 18 4.80 (4.80) 21 8.60 (4.20) 48.12 \u22123.80 (\u22126.65 to \u22120.95)\nKabalin, 1995\n177 13 7.20 (6.13) 12 9.90 (9.00) 10.58 \u22122.70 (\u22128.79 to 3.39)\nMartenson, 1999\n178 30 11.80 (6.90) 14 4.70 (4.00) 37.37 7.10 (3.86\u201310.34)\nSuvakovic, 1996\n179 10 16.80 (15.00) 10 12.80 (5.90) 3.93 4.00 (\u22125.99 to 13.99)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 71 57 100.00 0.70 (\u22121.28 to 2.68)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 26.17, df = 3( p < 0.00001), I\n2 = 88.5%\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.69 (p = 0.49)\n04 TUIP vs TURP\nAliaga, 1998\n149 20 4.30 (4.50) 21 4.80 (4.80) 100.00 \u22120.50 (\u22123.35 to 2.35)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 20 21 100.00 \u22120.50 (\u22123.35 to 2.35)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.34 (p = 0.73)\n05 Laser resectionv s TURP\nTan, 2003\n248 29 3.40 (4.84) 28 4.80 (4.23) 37.95 \u22121.40 (\u22123.76 to 0.96)\nWestenberg, 2004\n189 59 5.70 (5.20) 61 5.60 (5.10) 62.05 0.10 (\u22121.74 to 1.94)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 88 89 100.00 \u22120.47 (\u22121.92 to 0.98)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 0.97, df = 1( p = 0.33), I\n2 = 0%\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.63 (p = 0.53)\n06 Laser vaporisation vs TURP\nKeoghane, 2000\n164 55 9.60 (7.50) 62 6.50 (5.10) 34.07 3.10 (0.75\u20135.45)\nSengor, 1996\n192 30 8.50 (4.20) 30 9.80 (3.10) 54.10 \u22121.30 (\u22123.17 to 0.57)\nSuvakovic, 1996\n179 10 9.70 (2.60) 10 12.80 (5.90) 11.82 \u22123.10 (\u22127.10 to 0.90)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 95 102 100.00 \u22120.01 (\u22121.39 to 1.36)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 10.84, df = 2( p = 0.004), I\n2 = 81.5%\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.02 (p = 0.98)\n07 TUVRP vs TURP\nLiu, 2006\n132 42 8.20 (2.20) 30 7.90 (1.80) 100.00 0.30 (\u22120.63 to 1.23)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 42 30 100.00 0.30 (\u22120.63 to 1.23)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.63 (p = 0.53)\n08 B-TURP vs TURP\nSeckiner, 2006\n161 24 9.30 (3.90) 24 10.60 (6.30) 100.00 \u22121.30 (\u22124.26 to 1.66)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 24 24 100.00 \u22121.30 (\u22124.26 to 1.66)\nTest for heterogeneity: not applicable\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.86 (p = 0.39)\n09 TUVP vs TURP\nFowler, 2005\n57 105 11.80 (7.70) 110 9.80 (7.20) 6.66 2.00 (0.01\u20133.99)\nGalluci, 1998\n138 70 5.50 (4.77) 80 5.52 (4.11) 12.87 \u22120.02 (\u22121.46 to 1.42)\nGotoh, 1999\n156 23 3.70 (2.40) 28 3.80 (2.30) 15.71 \u22120.10 (\u22121.40 to 1.20)\nKaplan, 1998\n55 32 9.20 (2.70) 32 8.60 (2.50) 16.31 0.60 (\u22120.67 to 1.87)\nNathan, 1996\n162 20 2.86 (2.80) 20 3.10 (2.30) 10.51 \u22120.24 (\u22121.83 to 1.35)\nNuhoglu, 2005\n199 35 4.70 (3.10) 38 4.80 (4.20) 9.34 \u22120.10 (\u22121.78 to 1.58)\nShokeir, 1997\n200 35 4.50 (1.90) 35 4.80 (2.20) 28.59 \u22120.30 (\u22121.26 to 0.66)\nSubtotal (95% CI) 320 343 100.00 0.09 (\u22120.42 to 0.61)\nTest for heterogeneity: \u03c7\n2 = 5.09, df = 6( p = 0.53), I\n2 = 0%\nTest for overall effect: z = 0.35 (p = 0.72)\n\u221210 \u22125  0  5  10\n Favours intervention  Favours TURP\nFIGURE 27  IPSS\/AUA scores by comparison at 3 months.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

The price year was 2006 and \nthe currency was UK pounds sterling. \nMultiple versus single \ncohort analysis \nA time horizon of \u2018until death\u2019 was planned \nfor a sensitivity analysis. However, the need to \nincorporate capital costs (e.g. for HoLEP) led \nto a change in model structure from one that is \n\u2018individual based\u2019 [i.e. estimating the expected \ncost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per \nindividual] to one that is \u2018population based\u2019. The \nstandard individual-based model structure is \nidentical to averaging across a cohort of identical \nindividuals all starting treatment at the same \ntime. The approach used in this analysis allowed \nfor new individuals to enter over a time period, \nwhich we assumed was the approximate lifetime of \nthe technologies of 10 years. This is equivalent to \nhaving multiple versus single cohort analysis. This \nmeans that there is a \u2018mixing\u2019 of individuals over \ntime such that at 1-year post technology change \nthere will be equal numbers of those receiving \ntheir first treatment (0 years post treatment) and \nthose who are 1-year post first treatment. After 10 \nyears there will thus be equal numbers from year \n0 to year 10 post treatment. This allows for the \nincorporation of capital equipment costs over the \ntime horizon as required for strategies in which \nequipment is not used as the first-line treatment \nbut rather to manage subsequent failure of \ntreatment or relapse. For example, in the strategy \nTUVP\/HoLEP, HoLEP is never used as the first-line \ntreatment and it is clear that, over time, as more \nnew individuals are treated, the amount of HoLEP \nequipment required will increase. \nSuch a model involves greater complexity in that, \nas described below, the model must \u2018keep track\u2019 of \ntime post technology introduction (for the whole \npopulation) as well as time post first treatment (for \nthe individual, including age-dependent mortality). \nHowever, this approach allows the simulation of \nthe purchasing of new equipment as required over \nthe time horizon and produces a more accurate \nestimation of costs and effectiveness and thus cost-\neffectiveness. \nThe rest of this chapter is subdivided in the \nsame way as in the review of economic evaluation \nreported in Chapter 4 except that the section on \nsensitivity analysis deals only with the probabilistic \nanalysis. As already explained, deterministic \nsensitivity analysis is reserved for testing the \neffect of parameter variability or model structure \nuncertainty and is therefore dealt with under the \nsubheadings below.\nPopulation\nThe population is men with a specified mean start \nage with a diagnosis of BPE (no other size criteria), \npresence of LUTS (with a measure of IPSS > 7), no \ncomplications and TURP indicated. This implies \nthat medical treatment is either contraindicated or \nhas failed. In the base-case analysis the mean start \nage was 70. This value was chosen because it lies \napproximately in the middle of the current range \nof age at treatment. In the sensitivity analysis the \nmean start age has been varied between 50 and 90 \nbecause this represents approximate ranges for the \ndefined population.\nThe technologies to compare\nThe strategies chosen were those that the clinical \nexperts believed to be clinically appropriate and \nwere designed to adequately capture events that \nwere likely to incur costs and health changes \nover the 10-year time horizon of the model. \nThe strategies were formulated over the course \nof several meetings of clinicians involved in the \nstudy supplemented by discussion with the health \neconomist and with additional input from other \nurologist colleagues to resolve differences in \nopinion. A time horizon of 10 years was chosen \nbecause it was believed a priori that this would \nChapter 10  \nEconomic analysisEconomic analysis\n100\nbe sufficient to show the differences between \ntechnologies. \nThe problem with using strategies is that the \ncomparison of each possible sequence of treatments \nis costly in terms of building and estimating the \nmodel and, until the model is completed, it cannot \nbe used to eliminate any sequences. However, \nthe guiding principle at each step of the research \nprocess is the perceived value of information \nanalysis, based on the current evidence. Before \nundertaking any calculation of value of information \nbased on the model itself, judgement is required \nas to whether a particular sequence is feasible for \nthe given setting and is sufficiently important to \nwarrant the additional research cost of adding \nthat sequence. Therefore, treatment sequences \nwere reduced according to a set of clinical rules \nregarding treatments in the minimally invasive (M), \nTURP (T) and other tissue ablative (A) categories, \nand:\nAlways proceed from less to more invasive. 1. \nNever repeat one of the other tissue ablative  2. \nprocedures.\nRepeat a minimally invasive procedure no  3. \nmore than once.\nRepeat TURP only once and only after  4. \nperforming a pressure test.\nNever change to another treatment from the  5. \nsame category.\nThe basis for (1) is the belief that if a more invasive \ntreatment is ineffective then the less invasive one \nwill also be ineffective. The second assumption is \ntantamount to saying that any change due to tissue \nablative treatments renders the prostate \u2018immune\u2019 \nto further benefit from this class of treatments. \nThe third assumption is based on the belief that \nadditional structural change to the prostate is \nextremely unlikely to occur given two previous \nattempts. The fourth is based on standard practice \nwithin the UK. The fifth is based on the belief \nthat if one procedure in a category has failed then \nanother from the same category is unlikely to be \nmore successful than repeating the same procedure \nand that no more than one treatment from the \nsame category is likely to be available in any given \ninstitution.\nThe strategies compared in the DAM were:\nOne treatment only: M, A, T. 1. \nTwo treatments: MM, MA, MT, AT, TT. 2. \nThree treatments: MMA, MMT, MAT, MTT. 3. \nFour treatments: MMAT, MMTT, MATT. 4. \nFive treatments: MMATT. 5. \nOut of all possible treatments in each of the \ncategories, a representative was chosen based on \nthe one most likely to be used in the UK: TUMT \nand laser coagulation in the minimally invasive \ncategory; and TUVP in the tissue ablative category. \nTwo further treatments were added: laser resection, \nas exemplified by HoLEP; and laser vaporisation, \nas exemplified by KTP. HoLEP was treated as a \nTURP substitute but without the possibility that it \ncould be repeated as it was believed that it removes \nso much tissue that there can be no subsequent \ntreatment. KTP was treated as a substitute for \nTUVP.\nThe epidemiology: \nmodel structure\nA Markov model was used in which health states \nand order of transitions were determined a priori \naccording to a logical sequence of events (e.g. \ntreatment cannot follow death) and expert clinical \njudgement (e.g. permanent urinary incontinence \ncontraindicates further treatment). The cycle \nlength was set at 3 months. This was based on the \nadvice by the clinical expert group that there was \nunlikely to be any difference between treatments \nover a shorter time period. Given the length of \nfollow-up of 10 years this meant that costs and \neffects were estimated over 40 cycles. As described \nabove, as well as estimating the consequences \n(cost and QALYs) accruing to each individual over \ntime, these consequences were summed over a \npopulation over 10 years. This was operationalised \nby creating another \u2018state\u2019 from which new \nindividuals could enter the model in each cycle. For \nsimplicity this state is not included in the diagram \nbelow. The number of new individuals was assumed \nto be 25,000 per year, which is approximately the \nnumber of first TURP procedures per year in the \nUK. This was estimated from the NHS reference \ncosts, 2005\u20136,45 assuming that approximately 5% of \nall TURPs in a year are reoperations.\nFigure 29 shows a generic component of the \nMarkov model, which represents the care pathway \nshown in Figure 1, in which each box corresponds \nto a health state. Given survival (i.e. no death) \nthere are two main dimensions of outcome \n(incontinence or not and remission or not), which, \nbeing independent, imply four possible health state \ntransitions following treatment. The state of death, \nwhich is not shown, is an absorbing state in that it \ncannot be left and it can also be entered from any Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

In keeping with the argument \npresented in Chapter 4, the only long-term \ncomplication that needed to be included in the \nDAM was incontinence. The states of \u2018no remission\u2019 \n(whether with incontinence or not) are entered \nwith the probability of failure for that particular \ntreatment. This defines failure as a lack of change \nof original symptoms. If there is incontinence then \nno further treatment for BPE can occur and the \nonly transitions possible are to death and from the \n\u2018remission, incontinence\u2019 state to the \u2018no remission, \nincontinence\u2019 state. If there is no incontinence and \nno remission and there are further treatments in \nthe sequence then transition to the next treatment \nwill occur. If the end of the treatment sequence is \nreached then the only transition that is possible is \nto the state of death. If there is no incontinence \nand remission then transition to \u2018no remission, \nno incontinence\u2019 can occur with the probability \nof relapse. This defines relapse as return to the \noriginal symptoms following an initially successful \ntreatment. \nAll other complications are short term in that they \nare assumed to have resolved within the first 3 \nmonths post operation and are therefore included \nin the treatment state. The events considered \nare acute urinary retention (AUR), bladder neck \ncontracture or urethral stricture (labelled BNC), \nblood transfusion, TUR syndrome and UTI.\nAll parameter values used to estimate the transition \nprobabilities and probabilities of adverse short-\nterm complications are given as expected values. \nSeparate tables are presented for cost and utility \nestimation in the relevant sections. Parameter \ndistributions that are used in the Monte Carlo \nsimulation can be seen in Table 30. \nThe epidemiology: \nparameterisation \nof the model\nEffectiveness\nProbability of failure (1)\nIn this subsection the method used to estimate \nthe probability of failure (defined above as the \ntransition from a treatment state to the \u2018no \nremission, no incontinence\u2019 or \u2018no remission, \nincontinence\u2019 states) of any treatment used on \nthe first occasion is described. Its modification \nfor repeating the same procedure in a strategy is \ndescribed later in this chapter.\nThe challenge was to find a definition of failure \nthat would be consistent for all treatments and \na reliable method to estimate its probability. \nTherefore, given that the aim of treatment is to \nimprove symptoms (LUTS), treatment failure was \ndefined as \u2018insufficient improvement\u2019 in symptom \nscore. \u2018Insufficiency\u2019 might be variably defined \nbut, according to the clinical experts (R Pickard, \nUniversity of Newcastle, J N\u2019Dow, S McClinton, \nUniversity of Aberdeen, 2006, personal \ncommunication), in clinical practice a percentage \nchange of less than 10% in IPSS is most often used.

Ideally, individual level data (ILD) \nfor each treatment would be used but such data \nare unavailable. ILD were available, however, for \ntwo time points, pre treatment (baseline) and \n4-month follow-up, for a sample of men from \na study population (in particular, pretreatment \nIPSS > 7) who had received TURP (R Pickard, \n2006, personal communication). Details of the \ncharacteristics of the patient population can be \nfound in Appendix 11. The most reliable data \ncomparing the effectiveness of TURP with other \nprocedures should come from the estimates of the \nWMD derived from the meta-analysis (see Chapters \n6\u20138). Therefore, the challenge was to estimate \nP(fail) for the other procedures using the ILD \nfor TURP and the WMD for the comparison with \nTURP for each other procedure. This constituted \n\u2018model 1\u2019 for estimating the probability of failure. \nA second model was also developed. In model 2 \nthe relative risks of retreatment obtained from the \nmeta-analysis were used to estimate the relative risk \nof failure of each treatment compared with TURP. \nThe results obtained from these two models were \ncompared in a sensitivity analysis.\nModel 1 (base case)\nTo estimate Pt(fail) for each treatment t, it is \nknown that the mean IPSS score post treatment (as \nreported in a study) is equal to the average score \nof the mean of those who are successful and those \nwho fail. This can be represented as:\nmeant(Ipost) = Pt(fail) \u00b7 mean(Ipost)fail \n+(1\u2212Pt(fail)) \u00b7 mean(Ipost)success  (4)\nThis formula can be rearranged to give the \nprobability of failure for each treatment, Pt(fail): \nPt(fail) = (meant(Ipost)\u2212meant(Ipost)success)\/(meant(Ipost)\nfail\u2212meant(Ipost)success)  (5)\nIf it is assumed that the trial sample is similar to \nthe ILD sample then the mean IPSS score post \ntreatment for treatment t (meant(Ipost)) can be \ncalculated as:\nmeant(Ipost) = meanTURP(Ipost)\u2212WMDtpost  (6)\nwhere meanTURP(Ipost) is the mean IPSS post \ntreatment for TURP, and WMDtpost is the weighted \nmean difference in IPSS post treatment for the \ncomparison of treatment t with TURP.\nSubstituting equation (6) into equation (5) gives the \nfollowing:\nPt(fail) = (meanTURP(Ipost)\u2212WMDtpost\u2212meant(Ipost)\nsuccess)\/(meant (Ipost)fail\u2212meant(Ipost)success)  (7)\nIn this equation meanTURP(Ipost) can be estimated \nfrom the ILD and WMD can be estimated from the \nmeta-analysis. However, it is not known what the \nmean IPSS is for those who, by some definition, \nfail or have success. To solve this problem it was \nfirst assumed that a percentage change in IPSS of \nless than 10% (x = 0.1), given sample uncertainty, \nis equivalent to no change in symptoms, i.e. a \nproportion of individuals who are treated will be \nconsidered to have failed insofar as \u2018on average\u2019 \nthey do not show any improvement in symptoms \nand this is independent of the initial IPSS. \nThe first assumption is, therefore, that the mean \npost-treatment IPSS of those who fail (mean(Ipost)\nfail) is the same as the mean IPSS pre treatment \n(mean(Ipre)) and is constant across all treatments, \ni.e.:Economic analysis\n108\nmean(Ipost)fail = mean(Ipre)  (8)\nSubstituting equation (8) into equation (7) gives:\nPt(fail) = (meanTURP(Ipost)\u2212WMDtpost\u2212meant(Ipost)\nsuccess)\/(mean(Ipre)\u2212meant(Ipost)success)  (9)\nIf it is further assumed that the mean IPSS post \ntreatment for those for whom treatment was \na success (mean(Ipost)success)) is constant across \ntreatments then: \nPt(fail) = (meanTURP(Ipost)\u2212WMDtpost\u2212mean(Ipost) \nsuccess)\/(mean(Ipre)\u2212mean(Ipost)success)  (10) \nBoth of these assumptions imply that the difference \nin mean IPSS between treatments (i.e. the WMD) is \ndue only to a difference in the probability of failure \nand not to a difference in mean IPSS of those who \nare successful or mean IPSS of those who fail. This \nis convenient for the Markov model because it also \nmeans that the utility [which is a function of IPSS \n(see Utilities)] for the states of \u2018remission\u2019 and \u2018no \nremission\u2019 also does not vary between treatments. \nWhen t is defined as TURP then the probability of \nTURP failing, PTURP(fail), can be defined as:\nPTURP(fail) = (meanTURP(Ipost)\u2212mean(Ipost)success)\/\n(mean(Ipre)\u2212mean(Ipost)success)  (11)\nRearranging and substituting equation (11) into \nequation (10) leads to a definition of the probability \nof treatment t failing, Pt(fail), as:\nPt(fail) = PTURP(fail)\u2212(WMDtpost\/\n(mean(Ipre)\u2212mean(Ipost)success))  (12)\nIn the DAM, PTURP(fail), mean(Ipre) and mean(Ipost)\nsuccess were estimated from the ILD, and WMDtpost \nwas estimated from the meta-analyses reported \nin Chapters 6\u20138. Because IPSS values in the \nmeta-analysis continued to decline for up to 12 \nmonths post operation, it was assumed that this \nrepresented continued improvement. Therefore, \nthe WMD at 12 months was used as the estimate of \nWMDtpost.\nModel 2\nAs for model 1 it was assumed that the treatments \nonly differed by probability of failure and that \nthose who failed had a mean IPSS post treatment \nthat was the same as the pre treatment score and \nthat those who were successful had identical post-\ntreatment IPSS regardless of the treatment that \nthey received. Probability of failure of TURP was \nalso still estimated from the ILD. However, in \nmodel 2 the probability of failure of the other \ntreatments was estimated from the retreatment \nrelative risks estimate obtained as part of the review \nof effectiveness reported in Chapters 6\u20138. Of \ncourse, how the decisions to retreat were made in \nthe trials is not known and they were perhaps not \nmade according to the rule given above with regard \nto percentage change in IPSS.\nProbability of failure (2): repeat \nand subsequent procedures \nGiven no other available evidence it was decided \nto estimate the probability of failure of subsequent, \nbut different, procedures as if there was no previous \nhistory of treatment and subsequent repeat \nprocedures according to a relative risk (RR):\nPtfail2 = Ptfail\/RR(Ptfail\/Ptfail2)  (13)\nwhere Ptfail2 is the probability of failure of a second \n(repeat) procedure and the relative risk was \nestimated by clinical expert opinion (R Pickard, \n2006, personal communication).\nProbability of relapse\nRelapse has already been defined in terms of the \ntransition from the \u2018remission\u2019 state to the \u2018no \nremission\u2019 state. Again there is a lack of long-term \ndata for all types of treatment and the data that \nare available are only in the form of the rate of \nretreatment. Also, because long-term retreatment \nis the sum of retreatment following relapse and \nretreatment following failure (as defined above), \neach relapse rate was calculated as the remainder \nfrom the total retreatment rate once the failure rate \nhad been deducted, i.e.:\nPd(relapse) = Ptd(retreatment)\u2212Pt(fail)  (14)\nwhere Pd(relapse) is the probability of relapse, \nPtd(retreatment) is the total probability of \nretreatment (including that following failure) over \nthe time period d (obtained from the literature) \nand Pt(fail) is the probability of failure (estimated \nby either model 1 or 2).\nAll long-term probabilities were converted to \ntransition probabilities by assuming a constant rate \nover the time period. Thus:\nP3(relapse) = 1\u2212(1\u2212Pd(relapse)1\/d)1  (15)\nLong-term data on retreatment were obtained \nfor TURP for d = 5 years and for TUMT for d = 8 \nyears. The other treatments were assumed to be Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n109\nidentical to TURP or TUMT depending on their \nshort-term similarity as shown by the WMD in IPSS \nat 12 months. Thus, TUVP and HoLEP are the \nsame as TURP and KTP the same as TUMT. \nComplications (long and short term)\nThese are the probabilities for those complications \noccurring in the treatment state (AUR, \nBNC, transfusion, TUR syndrome and UTI) \nand incontinence. All non-TURP treatment \ncomplication probabilities were expressed in terms \nof a relative risk with respect to TURP and were \nbased on data from the meta-analyses reported \nin Chapters 6\u20138. The baseline values for TURP \nwere estimated by summing events across all \nTURP treatment arms of this meta-analysis. In the \nbase case those from the UK were used and then \ncompared with all studies.85 Given the variability \nin reporting, the DAM has not attempted to \ndifferentiate between the different levels of severity \nof these events. \nUtilities\nThe following equation expresses how the model \ncalculates the discounted expected number of \nQALYs:\nExpected QALYsstrategy = \u03a3 (0.25 \u00b7 EUcycle\/\n(1+discount rate)cycle)  (16)\nwhere EUcycle is the expected utility of each cycle, \ni.e. the sum of the utilities of each state weighted \nby their probabilities, and \u20180.25\u2019 indicates that \neach cycle was a quarter of a year. Of course, the \npopulation total was estimated by multiplying \nthe probability of each state counted post first \ntreatment by the number of individuals from each \ncohort for each cycle and summing across all \ncohorts and all cycles. For example, during year \n1 (1\u20132 years post technology introduction) there \nwill be 25,000 new entrants, whose state transition \nprobabilities are those of their first year post first \ntreatment, plus 25,000 entrants who entered \nduring year 0, whose transition probabilities will \ntherefore be those of their second year post first \ntreatment.\nTo estimate the utility of each health state it was \nnecessary to express utility as a function of both \nLUTS and complications. As stated already, the \nstates of \u2018no remission\u2019 and \u2018remission\u2019 are already \ndefined in terms of IPSS, i.e. \u2018no remission\u2019 is the \nstudy population that have an IPSS greater than \n7 and \u2018remission\u2019 is the mean IPSS of those who \ndo not fail, as estimated from the ILD. Only one \nstudy273 that maps IPSS to utility values could be \nfound from the search for economic evaluations \n(which included studies reporting utility values).\nHowever, although the clinical experts believed \nthat by far the most important factor in making \na treatment choice is LUTS, it was necessary to \nmodify the utility values in the presence of any \ncomplications, for the incontinence states and for \nthe within-treatment state complications (AUR, \nBNC, TUR syndrome and UTI). Therefore, what \nis first shown is how utility values are calculated for \nthe states of \u2018no remission, no incontinence\u2019 and \n\u2018remission, no incontinence\u2019.\nUtility as a function of IPSS\nKok and colleagues273 elicited preferences using an \naccepted method of time trade-off.75 The sample \nwas also fairly large (n = 170) and was composed of \nmembers of the general public (around Rotterdam \nin the Netherlands), which facilitates comparability \nwith the use of utilities to calculate QALYs in \nother populations. In their analysis they mapped \nIPSS scores on to utility values such that (Lo, Li)1 is \npreferred to (Lo, Li)2 if and only if U(Lo, Li)1 > U(Lo, \nLi)2, where (Lo, Li) is a set of levels, Lo referring \nto obstructive and Li to irritative, each defined \naccording to a range of the sum of the scores on \neither the obstructive or irritative domains of the \nIPSS measure. For example, Lo = 1 if Io <=4. The \ncomplete set of levels (derived in the Kok and \ncolleagues study from factor analysis of the IPSS \nof 1414 patients over the age of 50 years newly \nreferred in 13 hospitals in the Netherlands) is \ngiven in Table 31.\nThe resulting utility values are given in Table 32.\nTherefore, each combination of obstructive and \nirritative scores can be mapped to a mean utility \nscore.\nUnfortunately, the IPSS values are only reported \nin the literature in the form of mean total scores, \nwhich are the sum of the irritative and obstructive \ndomain scores. Therefore, an assumption is \nrequired as to the relative contributions of each \nof these domains to the total. In the absence of \nevidence it could be assumed that the observed \nproportion of the total IPSS of each of the domains \nis the same as the proportion of the maximum \nscore, i.e. because Itotal = Io+Ii, where Itotal is the \ntotal IPSS, Io is the sum of the scores on the \nobstructive domains and Ii is the sum of the scores \non the irritative domains, and because out of \nseven domains there are four obstructive to three \nirritative, each with the same maximum score, then \nIo = 4 \u00b7 Itotal\/7 and Ii = 3 \u00b7 Itotal\/7.Economic analysis\n110\nFrom this the utility of the state of \u2018no remission, \nno incontinence\u2019 can be estimated, as it is known \nthat the mean IPSS estimated from the ILD \nis approximately 22. Therefore, if Itotal = 22, \nIo = (4 \u00d7 22)\/7 and Ii = (3 \u00d7 22)\/7, i.e. approximately \nIo = 13 and Ii= 9, which, using the table of Kok \nand colleagues, maps to 2 on both the obstructive \nand the irritative domains. Using the algorithm \nprovided by Kok and colleagues273 these give a \nutility of 0.90, i.e. the utility of the preoperative \nstate, which is also the state of \u2018no remission, \nno incontinence\u2019, is \u2018on average\u2019 0.94. Similarly, \nfor \u2018remission, no incontinence\u2019 the mean IPSS \nis estimated from the ILD to be about 6, which \nmaps to a utility of 1, i.e. \u2018on average\u2019 successful \ntreatment restores individuals to a state equivalent \nto full health. The ILD provided some support that \nIo and Ii can be treated in the way described above \nin that they had a correlation coefficient of 0.4 \nand they occurred in approximately the same ratio \npreoperatively. Also, the mean utility estimated \nfrom the ILD both pre- and postoperatively was \nfound to differ by less than 0.005 when estimated \naccording to the assumption or when estimated \nusing the actual data. Nevertheless, a sensitivity \nanalysis tested the effect of using the minimum \nutility consistent with an IPSS of 7 for the state of \nremission. This corresponds to Io = 1 and Ii = 2 (or \nvice versa) and, thus, using the data provided by \nKok and colleagues a utility of 0.97 was estimated \ninstead of 1.\nUtility as a function of IPSS \nand non-LUTS factors\nOnly one study was found, by Ackerman and \ncolleagues78 (see Chapter 4), that estimated utility \nas a function of both LUTS and complications. \nThe challenge was to \u2018map\u2019 these values to the \nKok and colleagues utilities.273 This was achieved \nby \u2018anchoring\u2019 to the state without complications \nby assuming that the state of \u2018moderate to severe\u2019 \nBPE described by Ackerman and colleagues \nwas equivalent to the mean IPSS pre treatment \n(estimated from the ILD). This assumption can \nbe justified because the definition of \u2018moderate \nto severe\u2019 is an IPSS > 7, which is also the IPSS \nin the study population. The Ackerman utilities \nfor complications were then used in one of two \nforms, compared in a sensitivity analysis, either \nunadjusted or adjusted, by calculating them as:\nUKok(complication) = UAckerman(complication) \u00b7  \n(UKok(meanIpre)\/U(moderate to severe)Ackerman)  (17)\nTABLE 31  Map of IPSS to levels on obstructive and irritative dimensions used to produce utility values (see Table 32)\nDomain Summary score Level\nObstructive\nSeldom\/never \u2264 4 Obstructive 1\nAbout half of the time\/sometimes \u2265 5 and \u2264 16 Obstructive 2\nAlmost always \u2265 17 Obstructive 3\nIrritative\nSeldom\/never \u2264 3 Irritative 1\nAbout half of the time\/sometimes \u2265 4 and \u2264 9 Irritative 2\nAlmost always \u2265 10 Irritative 3\nTABLE 32  Utility values corresponding to obstructive and irritative levels (see Table 31)\nObstructive score\n1 2 3\nIrritative score 1 1.00 0.97 (0.11) 0.95 (0.09)\n2 0.97 (0.10) 0.94 (0.12) 0.92 (0.11)\n3 0.92 (0.15) 0.90 (0.14) 0.87 (0.14)\nData are expressed as mean (SD).Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Because \nincontinence can occur with or without remission \nfrom LUTS, there are two utilities: one for the state \n\u2018incontinence, no remission\u2019 and one for the state \n\u2018incontinence, remission\u2019. It was assumed that the \nutility of \u2018incontinence, no remission\u2019 was equal to \nthat for \u2018incontinence, remission\u2019 reduced by the \n\u2018disutility\u2019 (1\u2212utility) of the \u2018no incontinence, no \nremission\u2019 health state. The effect of assuming that \nthe utility of these states was the same was tested in \na sensitivity analysis.\nCosts\nIn keeping with the economic perspective, only \ncosts applicable to the NHS in England and \nWales have been included. The following formula \nexpresses the discounted cost function estimated \nfor each individual (thus excluding capital costs) \nfor each treatment strategy:\nExpected coststrategy = \u03a3 (expected costcycle\/\n(1 + discount rate)cycle)  (18)\nAs for QALYs, the total population costs were \nestimated by multiplying the probability of each \nstate at each time post first treatment by the \nnumber of individuals from each cohort and \nsumming across all cohorts and cycles. However, \nin addition, capital costs were included, which \nwere the purchase of equipment that could be \nused by more than one individual and over several \nyears. This category was assumed to apply only \nto HoLEP, TUMT and KTP. Also, as for utility, \nthe cost of each state needs to be estimated. The \nstates of \u2018no incontinence, remission\u2019 and \u2018no \nincontinence, no remission\u2019 incur no costs. The \nstates including \u2018incontinence\u2019 (\u2018incontinence, no \nremission\u2019 and \u2018incontinence, remission\u2019) incur the \ncost of treating incontinence. The treatment states \nincur the procedure cost and the cost of treating \nthe short-term complications of AUR, BNC, \ntransfusion, TUR syndrome and UTI. The cost of \nthe procedures was also distinguished by:\nthe length of stay of the procedure  \u2022\t\n(LOSprocedure), which was taken to be separate \nfrom any extra LOS due to complications and \nwhich had a cost, costLOSprocedure\nthe procedure cost (cost \u2022\t OP excluding hospital \nstay but including perioperative ward time, \ninvestigations and theatre costs)\ncomplication costs (cost \u2022\t comp)\nthe cost of purchase of equipment for each  \u2022\t\nindividual (costequipment).\nTherefore, the cost of the treatment state for \ntreatment t is:\nCostt = costtOP + costtLOSprocedure \n+ tcostequipment+ \u03a3 costcomp  (19)\nProcedure cost\nCosttOP was assumed to be the same for all \nprocedures. It was estimated by assuming that \nthe 2005 NHS reference cost45 [Health Care \nResource Group (HRG) code L28 (without \ncomplications)] for the surgical treatment of BPE \nwas the total treatment cost (including LOS due \nto initial procedure and complications). CosttOP \nwas calculated by netting out the cost of LOS from \nNHS reference costs using the formula below:\nCostOP = costreference \u2013(LOSreference \u00b7 costday)  (20)\nwhere cost per bed day, costday, was estimated for \na urological surgery ward from the NHS reference \ncosts with HRG code L09 (\u2018treatment of kidney \nor urinary tract infection\u2019) as this typically does \nnot involve surgery. This cost was confirmed by \nestimating the difference in cost between HRG \nL27 (with complications) and L28 (without \ncomplications) and assuming that this difference \nwas due mostly to the difference in LOS. LOSreference \nis the mean LOS given with the reference cost data \nfor codes L27 and L28.\nAlthough LOS estimates were retrieved from the \nmeta-analysis it was the opinion of the experts that \nthese largely reflected local practice and therefore \nthe LOS of each procedure (LOStprocedure) was \nbased on expert opinion of standard UK practice. \nTherefore, LOStprocedure was assumed to be 3 days \nfor TURP or TUVP, 2 days for holmium laser \nresection or laser vaporisation, and 0 days (day-case \nprocedure) for TUMT. These values were varied in \na sensitivity analysis. \nIn the absence of direct evidence the day unit cost \nof TUMT was estimated using expert opinion and \nevidence from several sources, including the lowest \nNHS reference costs for a day case and a local \nestimate (with cost elements removed to prevent \nthe double counting of \u2018operation cost\u2019). The cost \nwas estimated to be between \u00a3200 and \u00a3400, with \nan expected value of \u00a3250 and most likely to be no \nmore than \u00a3250 (the probability of being no more \nthan \u00a3250 was 0.75). Economic analysis\n112\nTURP and TUVP were assumed to incur no \nadditional equipment costs. For KTP, TUMT and \nHoLEP, additional costs of blades\/fibres\/probes \nwere included. Costs of laser equipment were \nestimated from manufacturers (R Pickard, 2006, \npersonal communication). The fibre\/blade\/probe \ncosts per individual were calculated by assuming \nthat for KTP and TUMT they are not reusable \nbut for HoLEP they are. The number of reuses is \nexpressed as a distribution based on expert opinion \nand manufacturers estimates (R Pickard, 2006, \npersonal communication). All of the data used to \ncalculate these costs are reported in Table 30.\nCapital costs were those of the purchase of the \nmachines and were estimated in the base-case \nmodel assuming efficient use at 250 uses per year \nwith a lifetime consistent with that of the model \nof 10 years. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to \nreduce the number of uses per year. Travel costs \nwere not included, as too few data were available on \nthe siting of equipment.\nShort-term complication costs\nAll costs of short-term complications were \nestimated based on expert opinion (R Pickard, \npersonal communication 2006). More specifically, \nthe cost of AUR was calculated as the cost of an \nadditional day of LOS for \u2018trial without catheter\u2019 \nplus, for the proportion of patients who fail this \ntrial (probability of TURP after AUR), the cost of \nTURP. The cost of BNC was assumed to be the cost \nof an additional TUIP. The cost of transfusion was \ncalculated based on the cost of a unit of blood of \n\u00a3635 (R Pickard, 2006, personal communication) \nmultiplied by the number of units (two on average). \nThe cost of UTI was estimated as the cost of an \nadditional LOS (3 days on average). The cost per \nbed day was costday as estimated by the method \ndescribed above.\nCost of incontinence\nThe cost of incontinence was calculated partly as \na recurring cost of oxybutynin [from the British \nNational Formulary (www.bnf.org\/bnf\/) on 3 \nNovember 2006; from 2.5 mg twice a day (\u00a38.98 \nfor 56-tablet pack) to 5 mg twice a day (\u00a33.26 for \n84-tablet pack)] multiplied by the proportion \nwho would have urge incontinence, estimated as \n0.95 by expert opinion. For the remaining 5%, \nincontinence was assumed to be cured by artificial \nsphincter, which incurred a one-off cost of \u00a36000 \n(R Pickard, 2006, personal communication).\nAccounting for uncertainty\nGiven that a systematic review and meta-analysis \nwere included as part of this project, in estimating \nthe parameter distributions for the Monte Carlo \nsimulation, the starting point for all parameters \nwas always an estimate of the expected value from \nthe sample and a sampling distribution, which is \nequivalent to the likelihood. The clinical experts \nwere asked to examine all of the estimates from \nthe meta-analysis that informed the parameters \nin the DAM to see how credible the mean was as \nan estimate of population expected value and \nwhether the size of the 95% confidence interval was \na suitable estimate of the magnitude of uncertainty. \nWhen there was other sample evidence, such as \nfrom the ILD to estimate the probability of failure \nof treatment, the sampling distribution was also \nused. When no such data existed, the posterior \nused in the model was essentially a prior, estimated \nby expert opinion (R Pickard, 2006, personal \ncommunication) and checked by further expert \nopinion (J N\u2019Dow, S McClinton, 2006, personal \ncommunication). The distribution was then \nestimated using an expected value and range, \nwhich implied an approximate 95% confidence \ninterval, or, where there was greatest uncertainty, \nonly a range, which implied a uniform distribution.\nTable 30 contains a list of all parameters, their \nexpected values, the standard errors and the \nconfidence intervals along with a note of the \ndistribution used and the source of data. All \ndistribution shapes were chosen according to \nstandard practice.77 All relative risk estimates \nfrom the meta-analysis for complications and \nretreatment and for cost from the NHS reference \ncost data on procedure cost and LOS were log \ntransformed to parameterise a symmetrical normal \ndistribution. Beta distributions were parameterised \nfrom sample-based means and standard errors and \nused to estimate the uncertainty of parameters \nbounded by 0 and 1 (baseline probabilities \nand utilities). The normal distribution was \nparameterised from sample data using sample-\nbased means and standard errors. This approach \nwas used for IPSS estimation for the WMDs from \nthe meta-analysis; the mean IPSS preoperatively \n(\u2018no remission, no incontinence\u2019 state) and \nfollowing successful treatment (\u2018remission, no \nincontinence\u2019 state), both from the ILD; and the \ncost of the pressure test following the first TURP, \nfrom NHS reference costs.\nWhen there were no sample data, the shape of \nthe parameter distribution depended on some \njudgement as to the degree of uncertainty. \nTherefore, the normal distribution was \nparameterised by assuming that the expert opinion \nof upper and lower bounds corresponded to \nthe 95% confidence interval.

The beta distribution was similarly \nparameterised for estimating the uncertainty of the \nprobability of requiring TURP because of AUR. A \nuniform distribution was used for the number of \nreuses of the HoLEP and laser fibres\/blades and \nthe lifetime of each of the machines as well as the \nprobability of the pressure test showing obstruction.\nThe Monte Carlo simulation was run with 10,000 \nsamples. The number of samples was chosen \nby trialling the Monte Carlo simulation with \nincreasing numbers of samples to determine \nat which point the addition of further samples \nresulted in no changes in the strategies that were \nnon-dominated and non-extendedly dominated \nas well as little effect on the incremental cost-\neffectiveness ratios (ICERs).

For example, if the threshold is \u00a320,000 per \nQALY, then TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2 would not be cost-\neffective. However, if current practice is TURP \u00d7 2, \ni.e. TURP followed by another TURP as required, \nthen TUVP\/HoLEP and TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2 are both \nless costly and more effective. Therefore, a move \nfrom current practice to TUVP\/HoLEP at such a \nthreshold would follow from these results.\nThe cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) \n(Figure 30) gives an indication of the amount of \nuncertainty surrounding point estimates of cost-\neffectiveness. Most of the strategies have a zero \nprobability of being cost-effective. Assuming \nthat society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY is \n\u00a320,000, it is clear that not only is TUVP\/HoLEP \ncost-effective \u2018on average\u2019 but also that it has a \nprobability of about 0.8 of being cost-effective. If \nsociety\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY is \u00a380,000 \nthen \u2018on average\u2019 TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2 would be most \nlikely to be cost-effective. However the probability \nof being cost-effective is 0.5, similar to that of \nTUVP\/HoLEP (Figure 30). Such uncertainty \nmight affect the decision as to which strategy \nto implement. However, the CEAC should be \ninterpreted with caution in that it does not reveal \nfor each sample what the size of the differences in \ncost and effectiveness are.\nComparisons of all treatment \nstrategies against a TURP alone \nas a common comparator\nThe data reported in Table 33 were used to \ncompare each individual treatment strategy \nwith the strategy of TURP alone (i.e. patients all \ninitially receive a TURP but should the procedure \nsubsequently be deemed to have failed then the \npatient is managed non-surgically). \nTable 34 shows the comparison of treatment \nstrategies involving only a single surgery with \nTURP alone. For the comparison of TUMT or \nTUVP with TURP, TURP is more costly but more \neffective. The incremental costs per QALY for \nthese two comparisons suggest that the savings \nobtained from a move from TURP to TUMT are \nprobably not worth the loss of QALYs. Conversely, \nthe savings that may be obtained from moving \nfrom TURP to TUVP may be worth the loss of \nbenefits (the incremental cost per additional QALY \nprovided by TURP compared with TUVP is greater \nthan \u00a330,000).

TUMT \u00d7 2 is more costly and less \neffective than TURP (TURP is dominant). Other \nstrategies involving TUMT as a first-line surgery \nare on average unlikely to be considered cost-\neffective. \nStrategies involving TUVP as a first-line \nintervention were found to be less costly and more \neffective than TURP, continuing the trend started \nwith the comparison of TUVP with TURP.\nThe final set of comparisons was for those \nstrategies that allow more than one subsequent \nsurgery if necessary (Table 36). The only strategies \nconsidered in this comparison were those in \nwhich the initial surgery was TUMT or TUVP. \nFor all those strategies starting with TUMT, \nthe incremental cost per QALY is at best on the \nborderline of what society might consider to \nbe worthwhile, as would be expected given the \nanalyses reported in Tables 34 and 35. The one \nstrategy starting with TUVP is more effective and \nless costly than TURP alone.\nSensitivity analyses\nTable 37 shows the results of one-way sensitivity \nanalysis on a series of predetermined parameters. \nVarying the values for these parameters did not \naffect the set of non-dominated or non-extendedly \ndominated strategies. The exception to this was \nwhen the probability of treatment failure was \nbased on the risks of reoperation and not changes \nin symptom scores. In this situation the use of \nHoLEP as a single treatment was excluded as it \nwas extendedly dominated by the other treatment \nstrategies considered. The reason for this is that \nthe probabilities of failure all improved when \nthe probability of treatment failure was based \non the risks of reoperation and not changes in \nsymptom scores. However, the probability of cost-\neffectiveness for HoLEP improved the least. \nIn all sensitivity analyses the ICERs are reported \nin Table 37. Any changes in ICERs are intuitively \nsensible. Whether these changes are sufficient to \naffect the choice of strategy depends again on \nsociety\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY. However, \nin all cases but two a change from the status quo \nof TURP \u00d7 2 would be cost-effective. One case is if \nthe LOS of TURP (exclusive of complications) were \nto be reduced from 3 to 2 days in line with that \nof TUVP. Here the decision would depend on the \nopportunity cost of moving to the more expensive \nbut more effective TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2. In the other \ncase, pressure testing is applied after TUVP as \nwell as after TURP, which, although not standard \npractice, might be plausible and would thus makes \nTURP \u00d7 2 the most effective strategy. Although \nthe ICER for TURP \u00d7 2 would be extremely high, \ngiven that it is already current practice it might \nbe difficult to cancel the most effective although \nperhaps rather costly treatment.\nMultiple cohort (population-based) \nversus single cohort (individual-\nbased) model comparison\nTable 38 shows the effect of estimating costs and \nQALYs for the entire population of men presenting \nfor surgery at the rate of 25,000 per year for the \nnext 10 years versus the effect of estimating costs \nand QALYs per individual from that population \nover 10 years, each starting now, discounted at \nTABLE 34  Comparison of single surgery strategies with the TURP strategy\nComparison \nwith TURP\nCost (\u00a3) QALYs\nIncremental \ncost (\u00a3)\nIncremental \nQALYs\nIncremental \ncost per \nQALY Alternative TURP Alternative TURP\nTUMT  \u00a3387,042,593 \u00a3435,632,543 90,6333 91,8222 \u2013\u00a348,589,950 \u201311,890 \u00a34087\nHoLEP  \u00a3400,549,783 \u00a3435,632,543 91,9656 91,8222 \u2013\u00a335,082,760 1434 HoLEP \ndominant\nKTP  \u00a3557,310,731 \u00a3435,632,543 90,7708 91,8222 \u00a3121,678,188 \u201310,514 TURP \ndominant\nTUVP  \u00a3380,774,844 \u00a3435,632,543 91,7082 91,8222 \u2013\u00a354,857,699 \u20131141 \u00a348,100\nHoLEP , holmium laser enucleation of the prostate; KTP , potassium-titanyl-phosphate; QALY, quality-adjusted life-year; \nTUMT, transurethral microwave thermotherapy; TURP , transurethral resection of the prostate; TUVP , transurethral \nelectrovaporisation of the prostate.Economic analysis\n116\nT\nA\nB\nL\nE\n \n3\n5\n \nC\no\nm\np\na\nr\ni\ns\no\nn\n \no\nf\n \ns\nt\nr\na\nt\ne\ng\ni\ne\ns\n \ni\nn\nv\no\nl\nv\ni\nn\ng\n \na\n \ns\ne\nc\no\nn\nd\n \no\np\ne\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nf\no\nr\n \np\na\nt\ni\ne\nn\nt\ns\n \nf\no\nr\n \nw\nh\no\nm\n \na\nn\n \ni\nn\ni\nt\ni\na\nl\n \no\np\ne\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nf\na\ni\nl\ns\n \nw\ni\nt\nh\n \nT\nU\nR\nP\nC\no\nm\np\na\nr\ni\ns\no\nn\n \nw\ni\nt\nh\n \nT\nU\nR\nP\nC\no\ns\nt\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\nQ\nA\nL\nY\ns\nI\nn\nc\nr\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nl\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n \n(\n\u00a3\n)\nI\nn\nc\nr\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nl\n \nQ\nA\nL\nY\ns\nI\nn\nc\nr\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\na\nl\n \nc\no\ns\nt\n \np\ne\nr\n \nQ\nA\nL\nY\nA\nl\nt\ne\nr\nn\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\nT\nU\nR\nP\nA\nl\nt\ne\nr\nn\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\nT\nU\nR\nP\nT\nU\nR\nP\n \n\u00d7\n \n2\n \n\u00a3\n4\n5\n7\n,\n8\n6\n6\n,\n0\n9\n6\n\u00a3\n4\n3\n5\n,\n6\n3\n2\n,\n5\n4\n3\n9\n2\n0\n,\n3\n4\n0\n9\n1\n8\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\u00a3\n2\n2\n,\n2\n3\n3\n,\n5\n5\n3\n2\n1\n1\n7\n\u00a3\n1\n0\n,\n5\n0\n0\nT\nU\nM\nT\n \n\u00d7\n \n2\n \n\u00a3\n5\n0\n4\n,\n4\n5\n9\n,\n4\n7\n1\n\u00a3\n4\n3\n5\n,\n6\n3\n2\n,\n5\n4\n3\n9\n1\n5\n,\n6\n3\n9\n9\n1\n8\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\u00a3\n6\n8\n,\n8\n2\n6\n,\n9\n2\n8\n\u2013\n2\n5\n8\n3\nT\nU\nR\nP\n \nd\no\nm\ni\nn\na\nn\nt\nT\nU\nM\nT\n\/\nH\no\nL\nE\nP\n \n\u00a3\n5\n0\n9\n,\n6\n0\n7\n,\n6\n5\n4\n\u00a3\n4\n3\n5\n,\n6\n3\n2\n,\n5\n4\n3\n9\n1\n9\n,\n8\n9\n3\n9\n1\n8\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\u00a3\n7\n3\n,\n9\n7\n5\n,\n1\n1\n1\n1\n6\n7\n1\n\u00a3\n4\n4\n,\n2\n6\n7\nT\nU\nM\nT\n\/\nT\nU\nV\nP\n \n\u00a3\n5\n0\n2\n,\n4\n3\n7\n,\n5\n2\n5\n\u00a3\n4\n3\n5\n,\n6\n3\n2\n,\n5\n4\n3\n9\n1\n9\n,\n2\n1\n9\n9\n1\n8\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\u00a3\n6\n6\n,\n8\n0\n4\n,\n9\n8\n2\n9\n9\n7\n\u00a3\n6\n7\n,\n0\n1\n9\nT\nU\nM\nT\n\/\nT\nU\nR\nP\n \n\u00a3\n5\n1\n9\n,\n0\n5\n1\n,\n2\n4\n4\n\u00a3\n4\n3\n5\n,\n6\n3\n2\n,\n5\n4\n3\n9\n1\n9\n,\n2\n8\n1\n9\n1\n8\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\u00a3\n8\n3\n,\n4\n1\n8\n,\n7\n0\n1\n1\n0\n5\n9\n\u00a3\n7\n8\n,\n8\n0\n1\nT\nU\nV\nP\n\/\nH\no\nL\nE\nP\n \n\u00a3\n4\n1\n3\n,\n7\n1\n2\n,\n9\n7\n2\n\u00a3\n4\n3\n5\n,\n6\n3\n2\n,\n5\n4\n3\n9\n2\n1\n,\n0\n4\n1\n9\n1\n8\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\u2013\n\u00a3\n2\n1\n,\n9\n1\n9\n,\n5\n7\n1\n2\n8\n1\n9\nT\nU\nV\nP\n\/\nH\no\nL\nE\nP\n \nd\no\nm\ni\nn\na\nn\nt\nT\nU\nV\nP\n\/\nT\nU\nR\nP\n \n\u00a3\n4\n1\n6\n,\n4\n6\n6\n,\n6\n0\n5\n\u00a3\n4\n3\n5\n,\n6\n3\n2\n,\n5\n4\n3\n9\n2\n0\n,\n9\n3\n1\n9\n1\n8\n,\n2\n2\n2\n\u2013\n\u00a3\n1\n9\n,\n1\n6\n5\n,\n9\n3\n8\n2\n7\n0\n9\nT\nU\nV\nP\n\/\nT\nU\nR\nP\n \nd\no\nm\ni\nn\na\nn\nt\nH\no\nL\nE\nP\n,\n \nh\no\nl\nm\ni\nu\nm\n \nl\na\ns\ne\nr\n \ne\nn\nu\nc\nl\ne\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \no\nf\n \nt\nh\ne\n \np\nr\no\ns\nt\na\nt\ne\n;\n \nQ\nA\nL\nY\n,\n \nq\nu\na\nl\ni\nt\ny\n-\na\nd\nj\nu\ns\nt\ne\nd\n \nl\ni\nf\ne\n-\ny\ne\na\nr\n;\n \nT\nU\nM\nT\n,\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nu\nr\ne\nt\nh\nr\na\nl\n \nm\ni\nc\nr\no\nw\na\nv\ne\n \nt\nh\ne\nr\nm\no\nt\nh\ne\nr\na\np\ny\n;\n \nT\nU\nR\nP\n,\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nu\nr\ne\nt\nh\nr\na\nl\n \nr\ne\ns\ne\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n \no\nf\n \nt\nh\ne\n \np\nr\no\ns\nt\na\nt\ne\n;\n \nT\nU\nV\nP\n,\n \nt\nr\na\nn\ns\nu\nr\ne\nt\nh\nr\na\nl\n \ne\nl\ne\nc\nt\nr\no\nv\na\np\no\nr\ni\ns\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \no\nf\n \nt\nh\ne\n \np\nr\no\ns\nt\na\nt\ne\n.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

To make the comparison clearer, capital costs \nhave been excluded. It has already been argued \nthat the former (population-based) approach is the \nappropriate model for dealing with capital costs \nand therefore this sensitivity analysis is intended \nto show that there is also difference between \nthe models excluding such costs because of the \n\u2018mixing\u2019 effect described above (see the beginning \nof Chapter 11).\nIt can be seen that the model does make a \ndifference to the precise ICERs but that TUVP\/\nHoLEP and TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2 are still more \neffective and less costly (not shown) than TURP \u00d7 2 \n(assumed to be current practice) and therefore the \nchoice of strategy is between these strategies.\nExpected value of perfect \ninformation (EVPI)\nAs described in Chapter 4 it is possible to use \nthe DAM to estimate the value of reducing the \nuncertainty within the model and hence reduce \nthe probability of making a wrong decision. \nUncertainty can be reduced by obtaining further \ninformation and Table 39 provides an indication of \nthe value of reducing all uncertainty in the model \nTABLE 37  Results of sensitivity analysisa (continued) Economic analysis\n120\n(i.e. our choice about which treatment or sequence \nof treatments is most cost-effective is based on \nperfect information). Also included in this table is \nthe value of removing all uncertainty surrounding \nestimates of specific groups of parameters (the \nexpected value of partial perfect information; \nEVPPI). The EVPI and the EVPPIs reported in \nTable 39 are calculated at a threshold value for \nsociety\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY of \u00a320,000, \ngiven uncertainty as to its value.\nWhat Table 39 provides is an indication of the \ncost of the uncertainty, either overall (the EVPI) \nor in specific groups of parameters (EVPPI), and, \ntherefore, the maximum value of future research \nthat might be conducted to reduce this uncertainty. \nParameter groupings such as utilities are not \nincluded because their EVPI was either extremely \nlow or zero, i.e. their uncertainty had little or no \neffect on which strategy was cost-effective. It should \nbe noted that this analysis does not reflect the \nvalue of improving model structure, for example \nthe method of mapping IPSS on to utilities. It also \nassumes that the distributions around all of the \nparameters identified are accurate representations \nof the real uncertainty surrounding these \nparameter estimates.\nGiven an annual number of men undergoing \nTURP in the UK of 25,000, a discount rate of 3.5% \nand a \u00a320,000 per QALY threshold, this places \nan upper limit on all future research investment \nof about \u00a35.3 million over 10 years. If it is \nassumed that the sizes of the EVPPIs are directly \nproportional to the value of conducting further \nresearch then research focusing on improving the \nestimates of TUVP epidemiology (i.e. estimates \nof relative risks of complications and estimates of \nthe WMD in IPSS relative to TURP) would have \nby far the highest priority. This could be achieved \nby undertaking more research comparing TUVP \nwith TURP, perhaps within an RCT setting, with an \nupper limit on spending of about \u00a34.1 million. The \nEVPI is highly sensitive to the willingness to pay for \na QALY in that it almost doubles to \u00a310.2 million \non moving from \u00a320,000 to \u00a310,000 per QALY. \nThis can be understood by observing that on the \nCEAC there is no clear \u2018front runner\u2019 at \u00a310,000, \nwhich implies greatest uncertainty.\nConsequences (disaggregated)\nThe cost-effectiveness analysis reported above \naggregates the time spent in the various states \nof the model by the quality of life associated \nwith these states. Although this has been carried \nout using the best evidence available and using \nexplicit methods, further insight can be gained by \nconsidering the time spent in each of the states \nwithin the model for each treatment and treatment \nstrategy considered (Table 40).\nTable 40 shows that each strategy is associated with \nthe same risk of death and hence the average time \nspent in that state is the same. The majority of time \nfor each strategy is spent in the state of remission, \nalthough the average number of years spent in \nthis state varies between 5.28 years for TUMT only \nand 7.92 years for TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2. Except for \nthe strategy of KTP (0.21 years), the time spent in \nthe state of incontinence is approximately a tenth \nof a year or less. Finally, the time spent in the \nstate of no remission also varies considerably, with \npatients receiving TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2 and TUVP\/\nHoLEP spending on average 0.05 of a year or less \nin this state and patients receiving a single TUMT \nspending on average over 2.74 years in this state. \nIn Table 41 the different strategies are ranked in \norder of the time spent in two particular states: \nremission from LUTS and incontinence (the \nhighest ranked strategy for remission is the strategy \nassociated with the longest time spent in remission \nand the highest ranked strategy for incontinence \nis the one in which the least time is spent with \nincontinence). These two states are included as \nthey are key determinants of the QALY estimates \npresented above. As this table illustrates there \nis no clear winning strategy.

Therefore, the findings of the CUA \nthat TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2 is the most effective in terms \nof QALYs are perhaps to some extent validated by \nthis analysis.\nSummary\nIn this chapter our DAM has been presented, \nwhich responded to the issues raised by the critique \nof previous DAMs reported in Chapter 4. The \nresults show that the least costly treatment is TUVP \nfollowed by TUMT and then HoLEP but that \nTUMT is less effective than TUVP and HoLEP is \nmore effective than TUVP. However, HoLEP might \nnot be considered to be the most cost-effective \nwhen balancing all relevant complications with \nLUTS improvement as shown by the use of QALYs. \nThis is because no treatment is 100% effective \nand the use of the most effective single treatment \nof HoLEP is believed to preclude any further \ntreatment that might otherwise \u2018mop up\u2019 those \nwho fail. Therefore, treating with a less effective, \nbut nonetheless still very effective, treatment that \nallows further treatment should there be failure \nmight be the best option. This approach has \nthe advantage of most men achieving effective \nsymptom relief with reduced complications \nand lower cost, although a few men would be \ndisadvantaged by needing a further, more invasive \ntreatment.\nWhether this is indeed the case and what sequence \nof treatments is optimal depends on two major \nfactors, the \u2018true\u2019 outcomes of the procedures and \nsociety\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY.

As for \nthe first factor, this study has attempted, through \neconomic and statistical methods, to represent the \nbeliefs of decision-makers, informed by the best \nevidence, regarding the relationship between the \noutcomes and each strategy. As stressed earlier in \nthis report, there are considerable limitations in \nthe current evidence base for estimating effects and \nso the values used in the DAM may be subject to \nconsiderable uncertainty. Nevertheless, the base-\ncase results should provide a basis to inform the \ncurrent decision as to which technology should \nbe implemented. Should it be shown that it is \naffordable then the model suggests that the best \nstrategy would be TUVP followed, if necessary, \nby up to two TURPs. In practice, however, these \nresults should be interpreted with caution and \nthe data on which they are based are probably \nnot strong enough to warrant a change in NHS \npractice from the TURP \u00d7 2 strategy. However they \ndo indicate that strategies of HoLEP alone and \nTUVP followed by HoLEP (TUVP\/HoLEP) might \nbe worthy of further consideration.\nThe value of perfect information results indicate \nthat it might be worth considering further research \nto better inform a decision in the future and also \nto determine the relative priorities of the types \nof evidence that need to be gathered. It should \nbe noted that the results presented depend upon \nthe imprecision around estimates being fully \nincorporated into the model. Nevertheless, the \nresults indicate that it may be worthwhile gathering \nfurther evidence to compare TUVP and TURP.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008.

Routine \napplication of such new technology is dependent \non many factors but is ideally governed by \ndemonstration of benefit over existing standard \ntreatment, in this case TURP. A systematic review \nof interventions with meta-analysis of available data \nand an economic evaluation was undertaken to \ndetermine whether any of the currently available \nnewer technologies provide greater effectiveness, \nfewer complications and greater cost-effectiveness \nthan TURP. \nSummary of results\nIn respect of symptoms associated with BPE we \nfound that TURP provides a consistently high level \nof improvement, which persists in the long term. \nThis is associated with significant improvement \nin quality of life and peak urine flow rate. Of the \nnewer technologies, minimally invasive options \nsuch as TUMT and TUNA result in less symptom \nimprovement and a smaller increase in peak urine \nflow rate. Ablative procedures such as TUVP and \nlaser resection (HoLEP) give similar symptom and \nquality of life improvements to TURP, and HoLEP \nadditionally results in a greater improvement \nin flow rate (WMD + 1.43 ml\/s at the 12-month \nfollow-up). Purely in terms of effectiveness, HoLEP \nwould appear to be unique amongst the newer \ntechnologies in offering an advantage over TURP, \nalthough, based on the current short-term outcome \ndata available, this is confined to the urodynamic \noutcome, which may not be of importance to \npatients. Longer-term outcome data are keenly \nawaited. Reduction in hospital stay for elective \nsurgery is currently considered to provide benefit \nto the patient in terms of avoiding complications \nand to the care provider in terms of reducing costs. \nSome of the newer technologies take longer to \ncarry out but in the UK and the US context may \nresult in a reduction in stay of up to 1 day, although \nthis may be associated with a more prolonged \nperiod of catheterisation at home. It should \nalso be noted that hospital stay for TURP is also \nshortening, from 5\u20136 days in the older trials to 3 \ndays in the more contemporary ones. The impact \nof increased operating time and reduced hospital \nstay will vary between care providers and different \nhealth-care systems. \nThe search for alternative methods of prostate \nablation has been fuelled largely by the risk of \nadverse consequences of bleeding during and \nafter conventional TURP. This is a particular issue \nbecause excessive blood loss and the requirement \nfor irrigation during the procedure may contribute \nto perioperative risk, particularly for elderly men \nwho often have pre-existing cardiovascular disease. \nOur review confirmed that severe blood loss, as \nindicated by the need for blood transfusion, was \nmore common amongst men randomised to TURP \nthan amongst those undergoing most, if not all, \nother interventions. It should be noted, however, \nthat contemporary studies such as those involving \nHoLEP show much lower rates of transfusion after \nTURP than older studies, suggesting beneficial \nchanges to the performance of standard surgery \nover time. \nThe situation regarding complications that cause \ncontinued disability and hence that can be assumed \nto have an adverse effect on quality of life with \nassociated ongoing health-care costs is much less \nclear. Sexual side effects of surgery, particularly \nloss of ejaculation and erectile dysfunction, are also \nof concern to men undergoing prostate surgery. \nThe risk of retrograde ejaculation is significantly \nlower for minimally invasive procedures and TUIP, \npresumably indicating relative preservation of the \npreprostatic sphincter. For ablative procedures, \nperhaps not surprisingly, the risk is similar to \nthat of TURP. Reassuringly, the occurrence of \nejaculatory dysfunction does not seem to cause \nmuch in the way of quality of life impairment \nfollowing prostate surgery. Rates of erectile \ndysfunction were similar across all procedures \nalthough lack of baseline data is a likely source of \nbias. The lack of effect of prostate surgery on this \naspect of sexual function is supported by data from \ntrials including a no intervention arm.6 The rate \nof incontinence, the adverse effect most feared \nby men undergoing surgery for BPE, was similar \nacross all interventions with the exception of \nTUNA and laser coagulation (for which reported \nrates were lower), although comparative analysis \nChapter 11  \nDiscussionDiscussion\n124\nwas hampered by variability in definition. This \nfinding is perhaps expected because all of the \ntissue ablative procedures follow the concept of \nremoving prostate tissue to achieve benefit and \ntherefore have the same risk of sphincter damage \nor pre-existing bladder dysfunction. The other \nmost pertinent long-term adverse effect is the \nneed for further treatment as a result of stricture \nformation, urinary retention or disease relapse. \nUnfortunately, as is frequently the case, these were \nnot primary outcome measures in any of the RCTs \nand the necessary long-term follow-up data were \neither missing or incomplete. Difficulty passing \nurine after surgery reflected by the complication \nof acute retention together with the later need for \nreoperation was, however, more frequently seen \nwith newer technologies, especially the minimally \ninvasive interventions, which probably reflects the \ngenerally smaller amount of tissue removed or \nablated by these procedures. This contention is \nsupported by results from trials using HoLEP, in \nwhich the extent of prostate removal is similar to \nthat of TURP, which is reflected in equivalent rates \nof retention and reoperation. \nThe results of the review of effectiveness were, \nalong with other relevant data (e.g. on costs \nand utilities), combined in an economic model \n(the DAM). The purpose of the DAM was to \ndetermine which single surgical treatment or \nsequence of surgical treatments for BPE would \nbe considered most likely to be cost-effective. \nThe DAM can be thought of as a further level of \nevidence synthesis as it sought to combine the best \navailable evidence to provide estimates of costs, \neffectiveness (measured in terms of QALYs) and \ncost-effectiveness. The results of the DAM suggest \nthat the treatment or sequence of treatments that \nwould be considered cost-effective is dependent \nupon what value we think society would be willing \nto pay to obtain an additional QALY. The most \neffective single treatment was HoLEP. However, the \nmost effective strategy was TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2. The \ndifference between these appears to be small on \naverage, but the crucial issue is whether society is \nwilling to pay for this gain in effectiveness.\nHoLEP as a single treatment was found to be \ncost-effective for a willingness to pay of up to \nabout \u00a34556 per QALY. Up to \u00a347,221 per QALY, \nTUVP followed by HoLEP would be considered \ncost-effective. Only at higher values for society\u2019s \nwillingness to pay would one choose the most \neffective strategy, i.e. TUVP\/TURP \u00d7 2. However, \nthe story does not end there because, even if we \nbelieve that these results reflect our beliefs as \ninformed by the best available evidence, there \nremains uncertainty. This was represented in a \nprobabilistic way and can be observed partly in the \nCEAC and also in the EVPI and EVPPI. The CEAC \nshows that, at a willingness to pay of about \u00a320,000, \nthere is little doubt that TUVP\/HoLEP is cost-\neffective. However, there are peaks of uncertainty \nat about \u00a35000 and \u00a350,000 and at these values \nfor society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY, EVPI \nand EVPPI are highest, particularly at a threshold \nof \u00a35000 per QALY. If one believes that the \ncurrent threshold for the NHS is about \u00a320,000, \nwhich is probably conservative, then it would \nseem reasonable to recommend changing from \nthe current practice of a single TURP to TUVP\/\nHoLEP. However, the economic model should be \ninterpreted cautiously because of the assumptions \nand uncertainties that underpin it as well as the \nthreshold value for society\u2019s willingness to pay for a \nQALY. \nThese results are consistent with the finding of the \nsystematic review of effectiveness. It is important \nto note that even relatively modest changes in \nthe parameter estimates used in the DAM might \nchange these results because there are few data \navailable for many of the comparisons and, as a \nresult, estimates of effectiveness (and hence cost-\neffectiveness) will change as new data become \navailable. \nStrengths and weaknesses \nof the review of clinical \neffectiveness\nThe strength of the study is the systematic \napproach taken to review the evidence (published \nand unpublished data without language \nrestrictions). Exhaustive systematic searches \nwere made of the major electronic databases. \nAll potentially eligible studies were reviewed \nfor eligibility and the study quality assessed. \nOutcome parameters were predetermined and \ndata were extracted using standard forms. Despite \nthese efforts it is possible that some relevant and \nusable data remained hidden as a result of non-\npublication. \nMoreover, more than half of the available evidence \nwas reported in abstract form rather than in full-\ntext published studies. The difficulties in accessing \nraw or summarised data from studies reported \nonly in abstract form are well recognised and \nthe process was beyond the funding limits of our \nreview. The exclusion of these studies prevents Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n125\nus from estimating the impact of this form of \npublication bias on the results. The reasons why \nso many trials were only reported as abstracts were \nunclear and ideally should be investigated because \npublication bias has been shown to account for \nup to 45% of an observed association, which may \nchange the direction of effect.274 \nEmpirical research in other fields has shown that \nunpublished reports tend to show less positive \nresults than published reports, and so exclusion \nof these could introduce publication bias. In \ntotal, 88 full-text primary RCTs were identified. \nAlthough this haul of relevant trials is impressive, \nthe majority of studies recruited small numbers of \npatients and covered many different comparisons, \ndiluting the opportunities for meta-analysis. The \nconfidence intervals around estimates of differences \nwere often wide and this problem may result in a \nfailure to demonstrate statistical significance for a \nclinically important effect or a failure to rule out an \neffect when it does not exist.275,276 \nAnother major limitation resulted from the fact \nthat the majority of comparisons were made \nagainst TURP, with few head-to-head comparisons \nof the newer technologies. Study inclusion criteria \nalso varied considerably between the trials, which \ncalls into question the generalisability of the \nfindings on meta-analysis to \u2018everyday practice\u2019. \nThis was exacerbated by variation in operative \ntechnique and treatment protocols between studies \ninvestigating the same technology. These variations \nwere of particular concern in studies involving \nlaser technology, in which there was variation in \npower settings and temperature, together with \nsite and duration of laser application. The limited \ndescriptions of technologies in some study reports \nmade it hard to determine whether they were \nminimally invasive or tissue ablative. This is an \nimportant possible explanation for the statistical \nheterogeneity that was common in the analysis. \nThe long time base of the studies reviewed (20 \nyears) in the context of rapidly changing and \nevolving technology also presents difficulties \nin interpretation of the findings. To overcome \nthis we categorised interventions conceptually \naccording to the mechanism of treatment of BPE \nbetween standard, minimally invasive and tissue \nablative. Despite this the ablative group does have \na range of tissue effects from partial vaporisation \nto complete resection. In addition, the standard of \nconventional TURP has not been static over this \ntime frame. Developments in camera and televisual \ndisplay and diathermy generators, improvements \nin perioperative care and concentration of the \nprocedure in the hands of specialist urologists have \nall served to make the operation more uniform \nin outcome and less morbid in terms of adverse \neffects. All of these factors are likely to influence \nthe findings. Although the review attempted to \nidentify and explore sources of variability, for many \noutcomes it remained unclear as to whether any \nconclusions should be drawn from the results given \nthe high statistical heterogeneity that was present. \nThe role of quality assessment in the conduct of \na systematic review is important. For this review \na robust combined checklist assessing different \nsources of bias was produced. We avoided using a \nscoring scale approach as this has been reported to \nbe inaccurate concerning the direction of bias277,278 \nand can include items that are unrelated to the \ninternal validity of a study.279 In this review we \nfound that the majority of included RCTs were \npoorly reported, which may be associated with \nlow levels of methodological quality.279 There \nare a number of mitigating factors such as space \nlimitations in the publishing journals but it is a \ngenerally held view that if necessary information \nis not provided then the quality will always be \ninadequate.280 Without adequate reporting, \nassessing quality becomes impossible,281 and \nthe drive to ensure adherence to standardised \nconduct and reporting guidelines for RCTs has \nmuch to commend it from the point of view of \nthe systematic reviewer.88 It is also of concern \nthat reporting of allocation concealment was \nunclear in 74% of the included studies and 14% \nused an inadequate approach to concealment \nof randomisation. This increases the risk of \nselection bias by disrupting the assignment \nsequence and may result in loss of the advantages \nof randomisation.282 The main consequence of \nthis is thought to be the generation of larger \nestimates of treatment effects.281 An observational \nstudy that assessed methodological quality of 250 \nRCTs from 33 meta-analyses found that odds \nratios were exaggerated by 30% for trials with \nunclear concealment protocols.281 There were also \ndifferences between trials with regard to baseline \ncharacteristics. For example, studies comparing \nthe efficacy and safety of laser resection with the \nefficacy and safety of TURP included patients with \nlarge prostate glands, whereas those assessing laser \nvaporisation included patients with a wide variation \nin prostate size. Variations such as these make the \nresults difficult to interpret. \nBlinding of patients, outcome assessors and care \nproviders is another important methodological \nissue and reporting of this was unclear in more Discussion\n126\nthan 70% of the studies. For the present review, \nobvious differences in the technologies make \nblinding of the patient and operator difficult, \nbut the outcome assessor could be blind to the \nallocated treatment and trial reports should include \na description of the attempts made to prevent \nascertainment bias. \nMany studies failed to report point estimates and \nmeasures of variability, which hinders calculation \nof the precision of the overall pooled estimate and \ncalculation of weighted mean differences when \nstandard deviations are required.283 In this review \nof effectiveness, when an appropriate measure \nof variability was not reported for continuous \noutcomes, consistency across studies reporting \nthe outcome was investigated. Methods to derive \nan estimate of standard deviation have been \ndescribed, based on the imputation of plausible \nvalues, but doubts as to their validity exist as many \nhave not been theoretically derived or empirically \ntested.283 It is possible that if means and standard \ndeviations were reported more consistently, effect \nsizes would be different. This is another reason why \nadherence to CONSORT guidelines for reporting \nof clinical trials greatly aids the conduct of robust \nmeta-analyses.\nA more specific methodological limitation that \nfrustrated pooled analysis was the use of differing \nmeasures of symptomatic outcome in the older \nstudies. We did attempt to convert the older and \nnow little-used Madsen\u2013Iversen symptom score to \nthe present standard of AUA\/IPSS using a method \nsuggested by Barry and colleagues284 but found that \nthe results lacked reliability. This problem forced us \nto analyse studies using the Madsen\u2013Iversen index \nseparately, so reducing the power of the meta-\nanalyses. \nIn summary, we believe that we have used the best \navailable techniques to identify, review and meta-\nanalyse the data that were available to us. This \napproach has enabled us to make robust broad \nconclusions concerning the relative beneficial \nand adverse effects of new technologies for the \ninvasive treatment of symptomatic BPE compared \nwith the standard of TURP. Our ability to consider \ninfrequent complications and achieve precise \nseparation of the different procedures according \nto relative effectiveness was limited by the small \nnumbers of patients studied, inadequate reporting \nof trials, the use of differing outcome measures and \nthe pace of technological development. \nStrengths and limitations \nof the DAM\nThe DAM chapter provides an explicit and detailed \ndescription of the method used. It sought to use \na set of criteria to identify which treatments and \nstrategies were clinically plausible for the UK \nand these were then compared in terms of their \ncosts and consequences. The pathways, developed \nfollowing detailed discussions with the clinical \nexperts involved in the study, were used to structure \nthe economic model and identify which data \nwould be required to parameterise the model. The \nmethods used to obtain the parameter estimates \nwere explicit and systematic and sought to identify \nthe best data available. When assumptions were \nmade about which data to use or how they would \nbe used in the model, these have been described \nand justified, and, when necessary, they were \ntested in sensitivity analyses. This sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted deterministically when \nappropriate, along with probabilistic sensitivity \nanalysis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis and \nprobability distributions for all relevant parameters \nwere obtained using explicit methods that met \ncurrent guidelines for best practice in economic \nmodelling.285 \nDespite our best efforts to conduct a rigorous \neconomic evaluation using the best methods and \ndata available, the results of the economic model \nshould be interpreted cautiously because of the \nuncertainties and assumptions that underpin it. In \nparticular, as described in the previous subsection, \nthe evidence on effectiveness is limited because \nof the paucity of the available evidence base. As \nthese data formed many of the input parameters of \nthe DAM, this leads to uncertainties in the results \nobtained from the DAM. As indicated above, when \npossible, data inputs to the DAM and assumptions \nwere tested in sensitivity analyses. In addition, \nwhen appropriate, parameters were estimated as \ndistributions. These distributions were based on the \navailable data and on guidelines for best practice \nand attempted to account for the imprecision \nsurrounding the point estimates used within the \nDAM. It is still, however, contestable whether \nthe parameter estimates and their associated \ndistributions are an accurate measure of the true \nvalues of the parameters. However, although \nthe data used were the best available and all \ndistributions were examined in terms of summary \nstatistics (expected value and confidence intervals) \nby the clinical experts to test their face validity, it is Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n127\npossible that the available data are biased. This is \nbecause, as described earlier, the data contributing \nto the pooled estimates of effectiveness were \nincomplete and heterogeneous. When sampling \ndata were not available, distributions were \nconstructed in a pragmatic way; however, expert \nopinion was always sought. Extensive one-\nway sensitivity analysis was also used to reveal \nparameters when the decision was sensitive to \nvariability within the range of a distribution. \nIn addition to the limitations caused by the \nevidence base, the economic evaluation suffers \nfrom a number of other limitations. First, \nconclusions about cost-effectiveness are sensitive to \nthe value that we think society might be willing to \npay for an additional QALY. Although there have \nbeen some attempts to define what this value might \nbe,286 in this report we do not explicitly identify \nthe opportunity cost (i.e. the benefits forgone) of \nredeploying resources to provide a more costly but \nmore beneficial procedure. \nThe model attempted to compare many different \nstrategies, indeed many more than any previous \nevaluation in this area. Nevertheless, it was \nnot possible to include every permutation of \ntreatments. Therefore, a series of judgements had \nto be made about which strategies to present. This \njudgement was informed by discussions with the \nsurgeons involved in the project team. Thus, twenty \nstrategies were compared within the model and the \nreasoning behind including these strategies was \nexplicit, with justification based on expert opinion \nand logic. \nOne of the determinants of cost-effectiveness was \nthe probability of treatment failure. Within the \nmodel, assumptions had to be made as to how \nbest to define treatment failure. For the base-\ncase analysis, the definition used for treatment \nfailure was based on clinical criteria relevant to \nthe UK (the percentage change in IPSS). However, \nthis created problems in terms of estimating \nprobabilities of failure from the literature in cases \nin which only reoperation rates were available and \nthe criteria for reoperation used in the different \nstudies were either unknown or variable. A \nmethod was found to solve this problem whereby \nthe best available evidence, i.e. weighted mean \ndifferences from the meta-analysis, was used, but \nit necessitated the use of observational individual-\nlevel data and the use of certain contestable \nassumptions. Therefore, the results of this analysis \nwere compared with the results obtained when the \nfailure was defined using reoperation rates. The \nresults using these two different approaches were \nreassuringly consistent. \nIPSS scores were also central to the estimation of \nQALYs. More specifically it was believed that utility \nscores that underpin the QALY estimates should be \nrelated to IPSS as well as to the presence or absence \nof complications. However, no single reliable source \ncould be found that would allow us to do this. Thus, \na set of assumptions to synthesise data from various \nsources were made. Some of these assumptions are \ncontestable but they were tested in the sensitivity \nanalysis and were found, on the whole, not to affect \noutcome. Perhaps more importantly, the estimation \nof QALYs relied on a mapping exercise from IPSS \non to utility scores. There was no alternative source \nof such data and there may be concerns over the \nvalidity and usefulness of the estimates it produced. \nThe estimates of EVPI did not capture the effect \nof removing this uncertainty as no probability \ndistribution was specified. However, it is likely that \nfurther research into the mapping of IPSS on to \nhealth state utilities would be warranted. \nEstimates of cost were not always easy to obtain; \nhowever, this study provided a breakdown of costs \nthat was sufficient to estimate the independent \neffects of procedure cost, hospital inpatient stay \nand purchase of any new equipment. Nevertheless, \ncosting by all resource categories was not possible. \nTherefore, a judgement was made as to those \nresource categories that were most likely to produce \na difference in the decision. These judgements \nwere informed by data that were relevant to the \nUK including the NHS reference costs. However, \nthe NHS reference costs are not provided for all \nrelevant treatments and, indeed, largely refer \nto TURP only. They also include a length of \nstay component that not only is a function of \nthe complications of treatment but also reflects \nvariations in practice. Therefore, methods were \nused to replace the length of stay component of \nthese costs with length of stay costs based on typical \nlength of stay (based on clinical opinion) and the \ncost of a day in hospital on a urology ward. It was \nalso assumed, on the basis of availability in a typical \ninstitution, that TURP and TUVP would incur no \nadditional equipment costs but that TUMT, HoLEP \nand KTP would. All of these assumptions were \ntested in sensitivity analyses. \nThe incorporation of complications into the \nmodel was also problematic. For example, there \nwere no standard reference costs available for the \nmanagement of complications and, therefore, \nexpert opinion was used to inform the cost of these Discussion\n128\nevents. The likelihood of complications occurring \n(i.e. the event probabilities) was also important \nfor the model. These probabilities were estimated \nusing the best available source, i.e. relative risks \nand pooled baseline TURP probabilities from the \nmeta-analysis. They are limited, nevertheless, by \nthe imprecision of the estimates, the possibility of \npopulation heterogeneity, variability in reporting \nand uncertainty in the time frame over which these \nevents might occur. Thus, it was assumed that all \ncomplications except incontinence were short term \nand that all cases of incontinence were of urge \nincontinence (although it is possible that some \ncases may in fact be stress urinary incontinence), \nwhich was assumed to be permanent. Again, these \nassumptions were explicit and justification was \nprovided. \nIn summary, the DAM has sought to use the best \navailable data relevant to the UK and combined it \nwithin an explicit model that was again structured \nto reflect the costs and consequences of treatments \nand treatment strategies potentially relevant to \nthe UK. Although the results of the DAM should \nbe treated cautiously, we believe that the results \nprovide the best evidence on cost-effectiveness of \nsurgical treatments for BPE available to the UK.Health Technology Assessment 2008; Vol. 12: No. 35\n\u00a9 Queen\u2019s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2008. All rights reserved.\n129\nImplications for practice\nBased on current evidence it is not possible to \nreliably identify the most promising minimally \ninvasive intervention, although, as a group, these \ninterventions are less effective than TURP but are \nassociated with fewer adverse effects. It is similarly \nnot possible to reliably identify the most promising \ntissue ablative intervention for the reasons \ndescribed above. TURP continues to be effective \nalthough is associated with potentially significant \nmorbidity. Each of the surgical interventions \nfor BPE has advantages and disadvantages. \nIrrespective of the choice of intervention, the \ntrue cost to patients and society in terms of \nquality of life has not been quantified to date. \nGiven that there are broad similarities in clinical \neffectiveness of the minimally invasive and tissue \nablative interventions, perhaps the most important \nissue is whether patients would prefer to have a \nminimally invasive procedure if they were aware \nthat the intervention, albeit with fewer adverse \neffects, would be less effective than a tissue ablative \nintervention and would have a higher chance of \nrequiring a second intervention. \nCurrent UK clinical practice suggests a preference \nfor oral medication using an alpha-blocker \nor 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, alone or in \ncombination, rather than the use of minimally \ninvasive interventions. If oral medication fails to \nimprove symptoms or if side effects develop, a \ntissue ablative intervention is offered. There is \nsome evidence to suggest that the benefits offered \nby minimally invasive interventions are equivalent \nto those gained from oral medication287\u2013289 and so \nthis could be a popular option for some men. \nThe economic model should be interpreted \ncautiously because of the assumptions and \nuncertainties that underpin it. The model suggests \nthat TURP alone or repeated is amongst the more \neffective strategies although it is not cost-effective \nin the Markov model. The model reveals that \nother strategies are possibly less costly and slightly \nmore effective. Should it be judged affordable then \nthe results of the model suggest that a strategy of \nTUVP followed by up to two more TURPs (should \na previous procedure fail) would be most likely \nto be considered cost-effective. At lower levels of \nwillingness to pay, a policy of TUVP followed by \nHoLEP for failure might be worthwhile. \nFor the NHS, increased use of TUVP and\/or \nholmium laser prostatectomy would lead to an \nincreased requirement for training, which may be \ncostly. Because of the limited number of surgeons \ncurrently providing these treatments it will take \ntime to establish an adequate level of provision. It \nis unclear how long this will take as no evidence \nwas found to indicate the speed at which surgeons \nmay progress up the learning curves for these \nprocedures. If interventions such as these are to \nbe used as second-line procedures, it would be \nimportant that their use is limited to specialist \ncentres only. However, in the absence of strong \nevidence in favour of newer methods, TURP \nremains clinically effective and cost-effective. The \nuse of minimally invasive technologies in the NHS \nis not appropriate until a more effective and\/or less \ncostly technology is available.\nImplications for \nfuture research\nResearch efforts in the management of clinical BPE \nshould now be concentrated on the performance \nof higher-quality, more rigorous studies. As a \nminimum, these should be RCTs using predefined, \nideally standardised, measures of outcome, and be \nmulticentre to ensure sufficiently precise estimates \nof the various outcomes. Such trials should be \nprotocol driven and a detailed protocol of how \nthe project is to be conducted should be agreed \nbefore commencement of the study. The protocol \nshould state the research objectives, reasons for \nthe study, issues related to study recruitment \n(inclusion and exclusion criteria), information to \nbe collected at entry to the study, interventions of \ninterest and arrangements for follow-up. A crucial \nstage in the development of a study protocol is \nagreement on the definition of outcome measures \nof interest so that outcomes\/complications reported \nin different collaborating centres share the same \nmeaning. Although all outcome measures should \nbe predefined, this is most important for specific \noutcome measures such as urinary incontinence, \nChapter 12  \nConclusionsConclusions\n130\nurinary tract infection and failure of procedure. It \nis also essential that the reasons for reoperation \nbe clearly stated, including when this decision \nis largely driven by patient choice. Future trials \nshould also include direct measures of health state \nutilities.\nIn the context of the NHS and the patient, it is \nhighly likely that choices based on strategies of \nmanagement are more important than choices \nbased on individual interventions. Areas in which \nfurther research would be important include: \nFor men who might currently be managed  1. \nmedically, a systematic review including \nmodelling to determine how many years of \nmedical treatment are necessary to offset the \ncost of treatment with a minimally invasive or \nablative intervention in the first instance.\nThe true costs of the different interventions as  2. \na critical driver of economic evaluations.\nConsensus work in partnership with governing  3. \nbodies such as the British Association of \nUrological Surgeons to agree parameters for \nconducting future trials, such as standardising \ndefinitions and reporting of outcome measures.\nFor men judged to need ablative therapy, is  4. \nthere an alternative to TURP that is more \neffective, safe or cost-effective? A well-\nconducted head-to-head trial of treatment \nstrategies \u2013 TUVP followed by either TURP \nor HoLEP versus HoLEP versus TURP \u00d7 2 \u2013 \nwould be the most desirable to establish the \ngold standard. Such a trial should take prostate \nsize into account and should also include direct \nmeasures of utility. Newer technologies could \nthen be compared against this gold standard \nand, given the rapid developments in this area, \na tracker trial approach may be appropriate.\nTrials of different strategies aimed at  5. \nimproving outcomes and minimising adverse \neffects after TURP, particularly bleeding (the \nmain serious adverse effect).\nIt should be stated clearly how data are to be \ncollected and processed, what the primary and \nsecondary outcome measures are and how statistical \nanalysis will be conducted. The early involvement \nof trialists, statisticians and health economists is \nimportant to ensure that proposed trial designs \nand methods are appropriate, including sample \nsize calculations. Consideration should be given \nto establishing a steering committee and a data \nmonitoring committee to guide the conduct of the \nstudy. \nIn addition to any future RCT, a further area of \nresearch relevant to estimating cost-effectiveness, \nwhich might be performed as part of an RCT or \nas a parallel study, would consider in more detail \nhow estimates of IPSS map on to estimates of utility \nand how utility, measured by a generic instrument, \nwould change as IPSS changes. Such work would \nfacilitate any modelling that may be required to \nextrapolate from the results of a future RCT.
