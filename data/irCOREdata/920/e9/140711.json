Most polymers which undergo electrochromic effects\ncontain either transition metals or extensive conjugated systems. We have found that a\nsimple commercial polyester membrane when coated with gold and polarised to -4 V\n(vs. Ag) in aprotic organic solvents displays an electrochromic colour change from a\ncolourless to an intense red state.\nKeywords.

Introduction\nAn electrochromic material is one where a reversible colour change takes place\nupon reduction (gain of electrons) or oxidation (loss of electrons), on passage of\nelectrical current upon the application of an appropriate electrode polarising potential\n[1]. A large number of chemical moieties have been found to exhibit this effect.\nRecent reviews [2,3] describe many of these materials, however the polymers utilised\nare often complex materials which are not commercially available and may display\nlimited stability to oxygen and water. Materials that display electrochromic effects\ninclude inorganic films such as tungsten oxide [2] and many transition metal\ncomplexes, whether in solution or incorporated within solid films [4-6]. Polymer\nfilms have also been formulated to display this effect, usually either by incorporation\nof redox-active species such as viologens within the film [7,8] or by use of conducting\npolymers such as polythiophene [9], polypyrrole [10,11] or polyaniline [12-14]. For\nexample a recent publication [15] describes the formation of red, green and blue\nelectrochromic polymers based on conducting polythiophenes which show a high\nstability and reversibility (10000 double potential cycles). Electrochromic polymers\nhave a wide range of potential applications, including \"smart windows\", reusable\nlabels and display devices [2,3].\nWe have recently discovered an entirely new class of high visibility electrochromic\nmaterials that change colour via an electronic effect that has previously not been\nrecognised. A particular advantage of these electrochromic materials and the effects\nthey exhibit is that they consume very little power during the colour change and\nconsume virtually no power thereafter to maintain the colour. Whilst working on\nelectrodepositing polymer layers onto simple commercial membranes, we have found\n3that polarising the membranes at cathodic potentials causes a colour change from a\ncolourless state to an intense red colour. Our initial experiments involved depositing\npolydivinyl benzene membranes onto porous supports for utilisation within\nelectrochemical glucose and lactate sensors [16-18]. It was noticed whilst\nelectrodepositing these films onto polyester membranes, that the membranes changed\ncolour [17, 18]. No colour change occurred when alumina membranes were used as\nsupports [16]. We found that the presence of the monomer was not necessary to the\nprocess and that electrochromism still occurred in simple organic electrolyte\nsolutions. Polyesters have been utilised previously in electrochromic devices,\nhowever they have not been the active constituent of the device but rather a flexible\nsupport for electrochromic layers of materials such as tungsten and niobium oxides\n[19]. This is, to our knowledge, the first time such a transition has been observed for a\nsimple polyester membrane.\nCommercial polyester membranes were evaporation-coated with gold on one side to\nmake them electrically conducting. They were then placed into an organic solvent\ncontaining an organic electrolyte and polarised up to -4 V vs. a silver reference\nelectrode. A variety of polymer membranes, solvents and metal coatings were utilised.\n2. Experimental\nAll chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetonitrile and DMF were of\nHPLC grade. The electrochromic solutions were obtained by dissolving tetrabutyl\nammonium perchlorate (0.2 M) in either DMF or acetonitrile. The choline\/glycerol\nand choline\/ethylene glycol ionic liquids were formulated as reported [6].\nElectrolube\uf0d2 silver conductive paint (Electrolube\uf0d2 Ltd, Berkshire, UK) was\n4purchased from Maplins Electronics, Manchester, UK. Silver wire (0.5 mm diameter)\nand platinum gauze were purchased from Blundells (London, UK).\nCycloporeTM 0.2 \uf06dm polyester (polyethylene terephthalate) membranes, CycloporeTM\n0.4 \uf06dm polycarbonate membranes, 0.2 \uf06dm polyethersulphone membranes, 0.2 \uf06dm\nPTFE membranes, 0.2 \uf06dm nylon membranes, 0.45 \uf06dm polypropylene membranes, 0.2\n\uf06dm polyamide membranes and AnoporeTM 0.1 \uf06dm alumina membranes were\npurchased from Whatman International, Maidstone, UK. 0.4 mm polyester filter\nmembranes were also purchased from GE Osmonics (MN, USA). Melinex polyester\nfilm (0.1 mm thick) was purchased from HiFi Industrial Films (Herts, UK).\nThe membranes were coated using an Edwards E480 evaporator. Films consisting of a\nsingle metal were 50 nm in thickness. In the case of gold-chromium films, 5 nm of\nchromium was evaporated, immediately followed by 50 nm gold. Multicore wires\nwere attached to the coated membranes via the application of \u2018Electrolube\uf0d2\u2019 silver\nconductive paint. The wire\/electrode joint was then insulated with a coating of epoxy\nresin, which also served to enhance the mechanical strength of the electrode.\nThe electrochromic measurements were performed in a glass cell of volume 200ml\n(Figure 1). The metal-coated membrane was used as the working electrode, silver\nwire as the reference and platinum gauze for the counter electrode. The electrodes\nwere positioned in a removable glass stage, which served to maintain a constant\ndistance between the electrodes. The connections to the electrodes were able to enter\nthe cell through three stoppered and sealed entry holes in the lid.\n5A Sycopel PCI 100 MK3 potentiostat computer interface was used in conjunction\nwith a \u2018Ministat Potentiostat\u2019, (H.B. Thompson and Associates, Newcastle upon\nTyne, UK) for all electrochemical measurements. The potential of the polymer\nelectrode was cycled from 0 to 4 V (vs. Ag) and back at a rate of 50 mV s-1. Colour\nco-ordinates of the resultant film were obtained using a CR-400 Chroma Meter\n(Konica Minolta). The visible spectrum of the polyester was measured in reflectance\n(the presence of the gold film prevents measurement of transmission spectra) utilising\na DH-2000 light source combined with a USB2000 Miniature Fibre Optic\nSpectrometer (Ocean Optics, FL, USA).\n3. Results and discussion\n3. 1 Electrochromism of polyester membranes.\nThe cyclic voltammagram of the system is shown in figure 2. As can be seen there is a\nclear transition occurring in the region of -2V. Repetitively sweeping the potential\nback and forth for up to 20 cycles did not affect the voltammagram.\n.\nFigure 3 shows the colour change that occurs as a potential is applied to the polyester\nmembrane which is suspended in a 0.2 M solution of tetrabutyl ammonium\nperchlorate in DMF. As the potential reaches -2V vs. Ag, a colour change is observed\nto begin (stage 1). As the potential becomes more negative this colour change spreads\nover the surface (stage 2) and at -4V vs. Ag, the membrane assembly has become\ncompletely red (stage 3). The same effect could be obtained by simply applying a -4V\npolarisation to the membrane and led to complete colour change in <5 seconds. After\nbeing polarised at -4V for approximately 20s, current flow dropped to zero, indicating\nno further transitions take place. Setting the potential to 0V, removing the connection\n6(open circuit) or removing the polymer film from the solution caused rapid reversal\n(<5 seconds) to the original state. This process could be repeated for at least 20\ncycles, however delamination of the gold film was found to eventually occur and at\nthis stage the colour change ceased to occur.\nFigure 4 shows the spectrum of the \"red\" polyester membrane. As can be seen there\nare two major adsorption peaks centred at approximately 420 and 580 nm. A\nunpolarised membrane was used as the background spectrum. Below 300 nm, the\npolyester in both cases adsorbed so highly that no spectrum could be obtained, i.e. all\nof the radiation was adsorbed. Measurement of the colour co-ordinates of the resultant\nred membrane (Fig 3, stage 3) gave L = 39.1, C = 38.6, h = 14.2o - which appears to\nthe human eye as a claret\/scarlet red.\n3.2 Variation of the metal coating.\nDue to the delamination of the gold film, other metals were investigated. Firstly, in an\nattempt to stabilise the gold film, a thin layer of chromium was evaporated onto the\nsurface of the membrane and then gold was evaporated on top of this. This had no\neffect on the observed electrochromic effect, the intense red colouration still being\nobserved. The gold film was however stabilised and this allows the electrochromic\ncolour changes to be reversibly cycled for at least 200 cycles.\nA thin film of silver could also be utilised and was found to give a strong colouration,\nidentical to that observed with the gold and gold-chromium films, however repeated\ncycling did eventually cause delamination of the metal coating from the membrane\nsurface. Chromium films were also utilised, however, in this instance the\n7electrochromic effect was only transient and the metal films were found to discolour\nrapidly, possibly indicating a corrosion effect. Aluminium coatings were found to\ngive similar results to chromium.\n3.3 Variation of solvent.\nAcetonitrile, which has a good ability to solvate organic electrolytes, was utilised in\nplace of DMF. When gold-chromium coated polyester membrane were polarised as\nbefore, colour changes identical to those in DMF were observed. As a possible\nsubstitute for an organic solvent\/organic electrolyte mix, two ionic liquids [20] based\non choline chloride combined with either ethylene glycol or glycerol were\ninvestigated instead, although in this case no electrochromic effect was observed. This\ncould be due to low conductivity of the liquid as a result of its high viscosity.\n3.4 Variation of membrane\nPolyester membranes from GE Osmonics were also gold coated and tested and\nshowed identical electrochromic effects to the Whatman membranes. However when\na non-porous, thicker sheet of Melinex polyester was utilised, no electrochromic\neffect could be observed. This indicates that there must be good penetration of the\nsolvent and electrolyte into the membrane for the electrochromic effect to occur.\nProbably the highly resistive nature of the Melinex sheet inhibits any\nelectrochromism. This may explain why the electrochromic effect has not previously\nbeen observed for polyester since although polyester substrates have been utilised as\nsupports in many previous electrochromism studies, they have been materials of the\nMelinex type rather than porous membranes.\n8As an alternative to the polyester membrane, other materials were used. These\nincluded glass microscope slides, alumina membranes and membranes based on\npolyamide, polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyethersulphone, polytetrafluoroethylene\nand nylon. These were all coated with gold and polarised at potentials between 0 and\n-7V vs. Ag wire. In all cases, no electrochromic effect could be observed.\n3.5 Variation of electrolyte\nSeveral electrolytes were tested as alternatives to tetrabutyl ammonium chlorate.\nReplacement of the chlorate with the corresponding tetrabutyl ammonium bromide\nhad no effect, with a strong red colour still being generated. No electrochromism was\nobserved when 0.2 m lithium chloride or perchlorate (in DMF) or sodium iodide (in\nacetonitrile and DMF) were used. It is thought that at the high potentials used the\nelectrolyte is reacting rather than the polymer membrane. This is confirmed in the\ncase of NaI by the rapid appearance of a yellow\/brown colour in the solution\nattributed to iodine formation.\n3.6 Mechanism of the transition.\nWe have described within this paper a strong electrochromic effect that occurs as a\npolyester membrane is polarised at strongly negative potentials. There are several\npossible explanations for this behaviour, although some of these can be ruled out. At\nfirst we thought that perhaps the solvent was being decomposed electrochemically to\nform a coloured product; however the use of two different solvents, DMF and\nacetonitrile allowed an identical electrochromic effect to be seen. A colouration of the\nmetal film can also be ruled out since both gold (with and without chromium) and\nsilver gave similar results. The electrochromic effect was however only observed\n9when polyester membranes were used, with other membranes of similar physical form\n- but composed of different polymers, giving no effect. We therefore conclude that the\npolymer itself must be taking an active part in this phenomenon.\nThe cathodic potential at which the electrochromic transition occurs indicates that\nelectrons are being injected into the polymer structure. Polyethylene terephthalate has\nthe structure shown in figure 5a with the conjugated terephthalate unit being the most\nlikely moiety to which electrons can be added. We propose a mechanism where either\none or two electrons can be added to the terephthalate unit to give either a radical\n(figure 5b) or diradical (figure 5c) structure as shown. What is interesting is that a\nresonance structure exists (figure 5d) where the unpaired electrons combine to give a\nnon-radical dianion which could stabilise the structure.\n4. Conclusions\nWe have reported here a novel electrochromic system which gives a strong red colour\nbased on a simple commercial polymer membrane. Although the current system is\nunlikely to be commercially viable, the fact that such simple materials undergo a\nstrong colour change indicates the possibility of a range of new materials.\nFuture investigations will involve chemical modification of the membranes to see\nwhether other colours can be attained. Also the potential required for the\nelectrochromic effect is relatively high compared to many others in the literature\n[2,3], modification may reduce this voltage. Finally attempts will be made to replace\nthe organic electrolyte with a less volatile and toxic alternative such as a suitable ionic\nliquid or a solid electrolyte.\n10\nAcknowledgements.\nThis project was funded by the BBSRC as part of the Centre for BIOARRAY\nInnovation within the Consortium for Postgenomic Science.\n11\nReferences.\n1.
