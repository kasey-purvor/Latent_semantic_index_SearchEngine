Nevertheless, if one accepts the premisses, proposed\nin this paper, on which the idea of hypermedia has been constructed, FLUENT shows a\nstrong relationship with it. The paper discusses this relationship after attempting to distil\nthe essence of educational hypermedia, and after presenting a taxonomy of media for\nlanguage learning.\nOverview\nThe hypermedia technologies seem to promise an explosion of opportunity for computer-\nco-ordinated educational environments. Some emerging possibilities were in evidence at the\nfourth biennial Exeter Conference on Computer-Assisted Language Learning (September,\n1991), featuring the use of hypermedia as central theme. In this exciting but sometimes\nconfusing environment, it will help to impose some sort of conceptual framework. To that\nend, I will first attempt to distil the essence of the field of educational hypermedia, and will\nthen present a simple taxonomy of individual media for language learning. These two\nanalytical lenses permit a clear view, in the latter half of the paper, of FLUENT, an immersive\nforeign-language learning environment developed by my research group. FLUENT grew up\noutside the hypermedia, but the two bear a strong kinship. After describing our system, I will\nexamine the media challenges it faces and show how it embodies the spirit of hypermedia.\nHypermedia\nConceding in advance that opinions vary as to the nature and best use of hypermedia, here is\nan attempt to synthesize in one sentence some widely held views on the matter:\n60\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nThe essence of hypermedia for learning is the integrated use of multiple media, with\nassociated activities in the various media that promote implicit learning and student initiative.\nClose reading reveals four assertions in the foregoing, which I now take up briefly.\nFirst, meaningfully integrated use should at least be possible, for otherwise the only benefit of\nmaking the media all available at once would be a slight improvement in convenience. For the\nwhole system to exceed the sum of its media, there must be some kind of potential synergy,\neven if the responsibility of finding and exercising it falls to the student.\nNext, technology-based activities for foreign-language learning range from computerization of\ntraditional syntactic exercises to the literarily sophisticated, interactive videodisc story worlds\nof the Athena Language Learning Project (Murray, 1987). A middle ground is the hypertext\ntranslation environment of the TIGER project (Deepwell, 1991).\nThird, implicit or indirect learning means getting away from explicit statements about the way\nthings are and letting students pick up an understanding of the target subject matter in the\ncontext of a meaningful activity. The importance of this kind of 'situated' learning has been\nargued for education in general (Brown et al, 1989). In foreign language circles, the\n'communicative' approach stresses the role of a meaningful situation, enabling the learner to\nacquire the regularities that grammars codify, without explicit mention of grammatical rules.\nThe last feature is student initiative. Allowing the student to get involved in deciding what to\ndo may have the cognitive benefits of both active learning and the development of study\nskills, not to mention the personal benefit of self-expression. A cautionary note is in order,\nthough: while the efficacy of active learning is well-established, it will not do for designers to\nabandon their responsibility to provide adequate guidance, leaving the student afflicted with\n'cognitive agoraphobia' (Twidale, 1991) or bogged down in a corner of the curriculum.\nMedia for language learning\nTurning from hypermedia to media, we present a simple taxonomy, summarized in Figure 1\nopposite. Note that there is no reference to particular pieces of equipment, nor to modalities\nlike music, for which there is at most secondary use in the foreign-language context. Our\napproach to foreign language immersion consists of conversations that take place in a\nsupporting visual context that helps the student to understand remarks that would otherwise be\nslightly too difficult. In addition, the student can use interactive graphics for replies, while\ngaining exposure to new words and grammatical patterns. Briefly put, this means\ntwo-modality, two-directional communication.\nThe figure shows the two modes and the two directions, and indicates further subdivisions\npertinent to each. One modality is language, of course, and the other is the spatial world that\nmost of us (sighted people) receive by vision and which a computer may present in two\ndimensions by means of graphics algorithms. The two directions of language performance are\ncomprehension and production, analogous to the familiar computerese terms input and output.\nThe usefulness of this taxonomy will become clear in the final section of this paper, where it\nbecomes a means to express design choices for our FLUENT immersion system, to which I\nnow turn.\n61\nHenry Hamburger Finely integrated media for language learning\nLanguage\ny\nTextual\nProduction\n\/ \u2014\nRecorded\nModality -\nSpeech\nDirection\n\u2022 \u2014\nGenerated\nStill\nSpatial\n^^^^^\nMoving\nComprehension\n^ ^\nPrecise Rough\nFigure 1: Summary of a simple media taxonomy\nThe FLUENT immersion project\nThe idea of immersion is to help the student understand and use the new language directly\nand automatically, not mentally to translate or compute grammatical formulae. To this end, we\nget the computer to provide some of the immersion activities that good language tutors often\nuse, employing the student's own language only to set the stage, and leaving the explicit\nteaching of grammar to others. (On the reasonableness of this approach, see Richards and\nRodgers, 1986. Also, note that it can be used with other systems - and teachers and books -\nthat complement it.) Immersion must be gradual, with exposure and comprehension preceding\ngeneration, and with new words and patterns introduced one at a time in situations where they\ncan be figured out from the visual activity and the continuity of the conversation.\nLet us see how these ideas play out in one of the microworlds that we have implemented\n(Hamburger and Maney, 1989; Hamburger and Hashim, 1991). Upon entering Washroom\nWorld, the student sees on the screen a drawing of a bathroom, suitably equipped. There is\nalso a person with a movable hand that the student can manipulate with a mouse to pick up\n62\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nthe soap or toothbrush, turn on the water, and so on. In one activity, the student's job is to\nmake the figure go through the moves of washing its own face, while the tutor makes relevant\ncomments and suggestions, all in Spanish. This activity promotes recognition of language, but\nother exercises check the student's language production ability, and leave it to the tutor\n(system) to make screen moves. In either case, the tutor is directly responsive to whatever the\nstudent has just done or said. The responses can vary somewhat, according to different levels\nof general achievement the student may have attained.\nThe most distinctive characteristic of FLUENT, is the very tight integration between the two\nmodes (language and spatial) and between student and system. Another important aspect is\nthat the screen actions influence and reflect the workings of an internal model, representing\nthe current situation and the properties of objects. Having such a model enables the tutor to\ndescribe an action or its resulting state or even to critique an action in terms of a\ncommon-sense goal structure. Thus if the student tells the figure to wipe his face, the response\nmay be: \"But I don't have the towel.\" The current implementation does these things with\nlimited flexibility. The next version, now under construction, is making more extensive use of\nthe techniques of artificial intelligence, including reasoning and especially natural-language\nprocessing. It will also draw upon techniques of intelligent tutoring systems to guide the\npedagogical decisions.\nBringing it together\nI can now fulfil the promise to relate FLUENT to individual media and hypermedia, perhaps\nshedding some light on them all.\nFirst, referring to the media taxonomy of Figure 1, I will mention a few design issues for\nFLUENT, touching on each modality and direction. Speech would be ideal for FLUENT, but\non the input side, recognizers are expensive and cannot readily deal with students' poor\npronunciation. On the output side, inexpensive generators have a robotic sound that one\nhardly wants a student to mimic, and canned speech prohibits generativity. We plan to\ncontinue with text but will experiment with a compromise of cutting and pasting recorded\nspeech, using multiple prosodic patterns for each recorded word or phrase.\nFor spatial output, we have opted for generated images rather than recorded (photographed)\nones, sacrificing visual fidelity in favour of close interaction between the student and the\nelectronic tutor. Showing movement involves another compromise, one between still and\nmoving graphics, a technique we call partial animation. This approach is exemplified by the\nscreen figure whose hand is manipulable but who is otherwise stationary, and a scene where\nsome objects are movable. Reaction from test users, even including a five-year-old, suggests\nthat this approach can be fully engaging.\nAs for language structure, however, compromise is far less in order. Since the system's very\npurpose is to convey, albeit implicitly, the structure and vocabulary of a foreign language, it\nwould be hobbled from the start if it did not handle language accurately and broadly. This\nentails using detailed, formalized language knowledge in a generative fashion. Therefore,\nalthough the current system gets by with simple pattern-based analysis of language input, and\nfilling sentence templates with simple generated noun phrases on the output side, the new\nversion is importing a very strong natural-language processing component.\n63\nHenry Hamburger Finely integrated media for language learning\nIn sum, although we do not bill FLUENT as a hypermedia system, it turns out to have all four\ncharacteristics proposed above as the essence of educational hypermedia. Certainly it\nthoroughly integrates the linguistic and the spatial media in a way that is essential to its goal.\nThe second feature, the use of multiple and integrated activities, is also present. FLUENT\nprovides activities for initial exposure to a microworld and its language aspects, as well as a\nvariety of activities designed for comprehension, production, and assessment. Third, student\ninitiative too is clearly in evidence. For example, in some activities the student controls the\ndirection of conversation by making things happen with the mouse, while in others the system\ncarries out student wishes expressed in language. Finally, the whole point of immersion is\nimplicit learning. Abstaining from explicit statement of grammatical patterns, FLUENT\ninstead provides a visual and linguistic environment in which those patterns should come to\nseem familiar and natural.\nReferences\nBrown, J.S., Collins, A. and Duguid P.
