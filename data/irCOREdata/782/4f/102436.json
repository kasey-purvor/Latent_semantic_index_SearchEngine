INTRODUCTION \nThe problems of illegally using, pirating and counterfeit- \ning digital images, video, audio and electronic documents \nhave led to the rapid development of digital watermarking. \nThere exist different watermarks designed for various.ap- \nplications. A robust watermark is usually used to verify the \nownership of the protected media and a fragile watermark \nis designed for authentication or tamper proofing and thus \nit must be sensitive to any accidental or intentional manip- \nulations. In this paper, we focus on robust watermarking \nproblems. \nIn a watermarking system, the watermark is inserted \nby modifying the cover data either in spatial or transform \ndomain in a certain way. A significant number of water- \nmark embedding methods have been proposed in the lit- \nerature. Many early watermarking schemes embedded the \nwatermark by using low-bit(s) modulation (LBM) [l] .  In \n[21, Chen and WomelI proposed a new embedding method \ncalled quantization index modulation (QIM), in which the \nwatermark message was viewed as an index to select a par- \nticularquantizer from an set of possible quantizers and then \nthe watermark was embedded by applying the selected quan- \ntizer. However, VIM is very sensitive to the scaling attack \n131. \nCox et al. 141 suggested an additive spread-spectmm \n( S S )  based embedding methud, Ui which a noise-like wa- \ntermark sequence was added to the lrcquency domain nf \nthe cover signal. In 151, flanung and Girod proposed to \nspread the watermark bits hy using a chip-rate, and then \nthe sprcadcd sequence was modulated by a binary pseudo- \nnoise sequence. For detection, the watermarked signal was \nfirst filtered by the pseudo-noise sequence, and the sign dc- \ntectnr was used to extract the watermark bits. Othzr similar \nwatermarking techniques can he found in [6, 71. We call \nthe above-mentioned methods traditional spread-spectmm \n(TSS) watermarking approaches. As the performance of \nthese traditional SS based methods suffers from the interfer- \nence of the cover signal, Malvar and Florencio [3] proposed \nan improved spread-spectrum (ISS) modulation technique \nto reduce the interference from the signal, which was proved \nto achieve a significant performance improvement over the \nTSS methods. \nIn this paper, we introduce a novel SS based approach \nfor robust watermarking: two-level quantization based \nspread-spectrum (TQSS), which essentially embeds the wa- \ntermark hits into the polarities of the frequency components \nof the cover signal. Section 2 introduces the background \nknowledge of the pmposed method. Our proposed algo- \nrithm is presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we show the \nsimulation results of TQSS and conclusions are drawn in \nthe last section. \n2. BACKGROUD \n2.1. Two-level quantization \nThe two-level quantizer is defined as follows \nMany watermarking methods employed he two-level \n0-7803-8554-3\/04\/$20.00 02004 EEE. 725 \nquantizer as the sign detector fnr watcnnark detection [3,5]. \nThe sign detector addresses the problem of detecting signals \nby using very coarse information about the statistical be- \nhavior of the noise. In a robust watemarking scenario, the \nperturbation noise is unknown and thus its statistical char- \nacterislic may not be simply estimated [XI. therefore, the \ntwo-level quaitizatioii could he employed as a useful alter- \nnative detection method which achieves a good trade-off of \nrobustness and complexity. In this paper, we employ the \ntwo-level quantizer for watermark retrieval. Furthermore, \nprior to embedding the watermark signal, we also quaitize \nthe selected frequency coefficients 01. the covcr signal into \ntwo levels. Thus, instead of emkdding the iiilortnation by \nmodifying the amplitude oT the coefficients, we essentially \ninsert the watermnrk hits to the pelarities of thc frcqucncy \ncomponents. \n2.2. Disliirtiiin bound \nI n  a general digilal watemarking scheme, the embedded in- \nformation is superimpnscd in thc cover signal by intmduc- \ning small modifications. The watermark embedding process \nc m  be described by \ns = x + w  (2) \nwhere x denotes a representation (e.g., a sequence of trans- \nform coefficients) of the cover signal, w denotes the water- \nmark signal and s the watermarked signal. The watermarked \nsignal s generally goes through a distortion channel. \ny = s + n  (3) \nwhere y and n denote the distorted watermarked signal and \nthe pertubation noise, respectively. Thus, the distortion \ncaused by the channel is: \nWI = llnll = IIY SI1 (4) \nFor a robust watermarking system, the distortion n could \nhe from both common signal manipulations (such as format \nconversion) and intentional attacks by advenaries. There- \nfore, it is very difficult to completely characterize the dis- \ntortion channel [91. However, the objective of an adversary \nis not only to destroy the embedded watermark hut also to \nreclaim the ownership of the documents. Tbus, the attacks \nare constrained by certain criteria (e.g., image's visual qual- \nity). \nThe distortion hound can he defined as the range of \ndegradation caused by the possible attacks, while the qual- \nity of the attacked signal still satisfies the defined criteria. \nHowever, the distonion hound is difficult to calculate ex- \nactly. The first reason is that it is difficult to define a gen- \neral subjective or objective quality measurement method to \nassess all the multimedia documents to he protected. Thus, \nFig. 1. I)CI coefficient difference al-ter JPECI BO compres- \nsion. \nthe strength of attacks could he very ditkrenr because ofthe \ndifferent quality measurement methods. Furthermore, ai the \nstage of embedding, the distoninn channel is unknown. The \nattack could he a single maiipulation, cambination of many \nmanipulations (e.g., the digital-analogue-digital \nconversion), or even a totally new attack to the emhedder. \nHowever, the distortion hound can be estimated and used \nduring watermark embedding after we investigate how the \ncommon attacks degrade the watermarked signal. An 8x8 \nDiscrete Cosine Tnnsform (DCT) is chosen in our experi- \nments. For simplicity, a randomly-selected 8x8 block Bij \n(1 5 i , j  5 8) of LENA is used for demonstration. Fig. 1 \nillustrates the difference matrix of frequency coefficienU he- \ntween the cover image subhlock Bij and the distorted sub- \nblock &. JPEG compression with a quality factor of 30 is \nused here as an attack. In Fig. 1, it can he easily observed \nthat the distortion of most frequency components caused by \nJPEG 30 is approximately within a range of IO. \nA simple method to estimate the distortion bound Td is \nto calculate the mean oC the difference between B, and z, \nweighted by a strength factor a. \n3. TQSS: TWO-LEVEL QUANTIZATION BASED \nSPREAD-SPECTRUM \nIn this section, we introduce the watermark embedding and \nretrieval algorithms. A general framework of the proposed \nwatermarking method is depicted in Fig. 2. \nIn this fnmework, before embedding, a two-level quan- \ntizer Q(.) is performed to x. The encoder embeds the water- \nmark hits m : {l, 1) based on the prior knowledge ahout \n726 \n1 \nU \nChannel n 0\nFig. 2. A framework of the TQSS watermarking tcchmquc \nthe weighted distonion bound 1:s. The watermark decoder \nemplnys thc two-level quantizer again to retrieve the water- \nmark ,ri!! from the possible signal-bearing v e h  y .  \n3.1. Walermark embedding \nPrior to embedding, the watermark bits T I L  are expanded \nby using a spreading sequence U : {1, l}, which is pro- \nduced by a pseudo-random number (PRN) generator. After \nspreading, according to the watermark bit to be 1 or -I, we \nobtain a corresponding sequence w1 or w 1 as follows. \nw, = mu (6) \nThe entire watermark embedding process is divided into \ntwo passes, polarity modulation and amplitude modulation. \nPulnrih. Modirlnriun In pass 1, x.first goes through the two- \nlevel quantizer Q(. ) ,  and then a binary sequence x, is gen- \nerated. We can always find ax;, which satisfies, \n(w\",x;) 2 Ts (7) \nwhere (.) denotes the inner product and T, denotes an \nappropriate positive threshold. The inner product is defined \nas follows. \n1 \"  (a, b) = - uibi \nN \ni = O  \nwhere a, b are vectors with length of N ,  and ui.  bi are ele- \nments of a, b, respectively. \nTo find x;, we define a polarity modulation function, \nwhich is used to toggle values in the binary sequence x q .  \nIf the inner product between w and x, is less than T,, we \ntoggle one bit in x,. then compute the inner product again, \nuntil the itmer product value is greater ban  or equal to the \npre-defined threshold T,. \nAirrplitrrrle Murlulrtion hi the seci)nd pass, the amplitude \nmodulation is performed as follows. \nwhere si denotes thc modified traisform coefficient, :cr de- \nnotes the polarity modulated coefficients a id  zGi is the OUI- \nput of the two-level quantized :c;. As described io the Equa- \ntion 9, only the frequency cocl'ficients whose amplitudes are \nsmaller than the distonion bound Td iirc modified, a id  those \ncoefficients with higher aniplitude are remain intact. \n3.2. Watermark decoding \nFor watermark decoding, we firs1 locate the watermarked \ncoefficients and perlhnn a two-level quantizer to find the \npolarity sequence y,. The pseudo-random sequence U is \nreproduced hy using the seed from the secret key. \nA minimum distmcc (MD) detector is then petformed \nto decide the watermark bits. \nTJP' = arg iiiiri (djst(wn,,y,)) (10) \nwhere nc' denotes the extracted watermark bit a id  &st(.) \ndenotes the Hamming distance function. \nm = 1 ,  1 \n4. SIMULATION RESULTS \nIn our expcriments, we employed an 8x8 DCT transform \nand pseudo-randomly selected subblocks for embedding. \nThe LENA image was used for testing. We compared OUT \nproposed TQSS with TSS and ISS methods. We fixed the \namount of embedded watermark hits and modified the em- \nbedding strength to obtain the same perceptual quality of \nthe watermarked images. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 illustrate the \nperformance comparisons under JPEG compression and ad- \nditive Gaussian white noise (AWGN), respectively. Table 1 \nshows the simulation results under more attacks. It can be \nobsetved that when the attack-induced noise becomes dom- \ninant in the watermarked signal, ISS achieves similar ro- \nbustness to TSS. However, in TQSS, as long as most of the \npolarities of the transform coefficients remain unchanged, \nthe watermark can be always correctly decoded. \nIn this paper, we restrict our attention to the \nnon-geomeuic attacks and assume that the watermark detec- \ntor is always synchronized. Some geometric attacks, such \nas scaling is also included in our experiments, but we as- \nsume the size of the cover signal is available for the decoder \nand thus the size of the inspected image is restored prior to \nwatermark detection. \n727 \nFig. 3.

CONCLUSION \nWe intmduced a new robust watermarking algorithm known \nas two-level quantization based spread-spectrum (TQSS). \nIn TQSS, the watermark bits were essentially embedded \ninto the polarities of the frequency components of the cover \nsignal. When compared with other well-known SS-based \nwatermarking techniques, our proposed method was found \nto achieve a significant improvement under a variety of at- \ntacks, such as lossy compression, additive Gaussian white \nnoise, scaling, filtering and print-and-scan process. \n6.
