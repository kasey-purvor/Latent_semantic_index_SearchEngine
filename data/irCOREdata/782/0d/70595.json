We employ the tight binding model to describe the electronic band\nstructure of bilayer graphene and we explain how the optical absorption coefficient\nof a bilayer is influenced by the presence and dispersion of the electronic bands, in\ncontrast to the featureless absorption coefficient of monolayer graphene. We show\nthat the effective low energy Hamiltonian is dominated by chiral quasiparticles\nwith a parabolic dispersion and Berry phase 2\u03c0.

Then, we describe the control of a gap in the\npresence of an external gate voltage. Finally, we take into account the influence of\ntrigonal warping which produces a Lifshitz transition at very low energy, breaking\nthe isoenergetic line about each valley into four pockets.\n1 Introduction\nFollowing the fabrication of monolayer graphene [1], the observation of an unusual sequencing\nof quantum Hall effect plateaus [2] was explained in terms of Dirac-like chiral quasiparticles\nwith Berry phase \u03c0 [3\u20136]. Subsequently, bilayer graphene became the subject of intense interest\nin its own right. This followed the realisation that the low energy Hamiltonian of a bilayer\ndescribes chiral quasiparticles with a parabolic dispersion and Berry phase 2\u03c0 [7] as confirmed\nby quantum Hall effect [8] and ARPES measurements [9].\nThe electronic band structure of bilayer graphene has been modelled using both density\nfunctional theory [10\u201312] and the tight binding model [13,7,14\u201317]. It has been predicted [7]\nthat asymmetry between the on-site energies in the layers leads to a tunable gap between the\nconduction and valence bands. The dependence of the gap on external gate voltage has been\nmodelled taking into account screening within the tight binding model [16,17,12] and such\ncalculations appear to be in good agreement with ARPES measurements [9], observations of\nthe quantum Hall effect [17], and density functional theory calculations [12].\nIn this paper, we describe the tight binding model of bilayer graphene and the corresponding\nlow energy band structure in Section 2 . Section 3 explains how the optical absorption coefficient\nof bilayer graphene is influenced by the presence and dispersion of the electronic bands [18,\n19], in contrast to the featureless absorption coefficient of monolayer graphene. We obtain\nthe effective low energy Hamiltonian of bilayer graphene in Section 4 and we show that it is\ndominated by chiral quasiparticles with a parabolic dispersion and Berry phase 2\u03c0. Section 5\ndescribes the opening of a gap in bilayer graphene due to layer asymmetry with a description\nof the band structure in Section 5.1, a demonstration that an undoped, gapless bilayer is stable\nwith respect to the opening of a gap in Section 5.2, and a calculation using a self-consistent\nHartree approximation to describe the control of the gap in the presence of external gates\nin Section 5.3. In Section 6 we take into account the effect of trigonal warping on the band\nstructure and we present our conclusions in Section 7.\n2 Will be inserted by the editor\nA 1\nB 2\nB 1\nv\nv\nA 2\nB 1\ng 1\nA 2\nA 1\nB 2\n( a )\ne\n( 2 )\ne\n( 1 )\ne\n( 1 )\ne\n( 2 )\ng 1\n1\n2\nv p \/ g 1\ne \/ g 1\n21- 1- 2\n- 1\n- 2\n+\n+\n-\n-\n( b )\nFig. 1.

We employ the tight-binding model of graphite [20] by adapting\nthe Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure parametrization [21,22] of relevant couplings in order to model\nbilayer graphene. In-plane hopping is parametrized by coupling \u03b3A1B1 = \u03b3A2B2 \u2261 \u03b30 and it leads\nto the in-plane velocity v = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b30\/~ where a is the lattice constant. In addition, we take\ninto account the strongest inter-layer coupling, \u03b3A2B1 \u2261 \u03b31, between pairs of A2-B1 orbitals\nthat lie directly below and above each other. Such strong coupling produces dimers from these\npairs of A2-B1 orbitals, leading to the formation of high energy bands. We also include weaker\nA1-B2 coupling \u03b3A1B2 \u2261 \u03b33 that leads to an effective velocity v3 = (\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b33\/~ where v3 \u226a v.\nHere, we write the Hamiltonian [7] near the centres of the valleys in a basis corresponding to\nwave functions \u03a8 = (\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1) in the valley K [23] and of \u03a8 = (\u03c8B2, \u03c8A1, \u03c8B1, \u03c8A2)\nin the valley K\u02dc:\nH = \u03be\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u2212 12\u2206 v3\u03c0 0 v\u03c0\u2020\nv3\u03c0\n\u2020 1\n2\u2206 v\u03c0 0\n0 v\u03c0\u2020 12\u2206 \u03be\u03b31\nv\u03c0 0 \u03be\u03b31 \u2212 12\u2206\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (1)\nwhere \u03c0 = px + ipy, \u03c0\n\u2020 = px \u2212 ipy, p = (px, py) is the momentum measured with respect to\nthe K point, \u03be = +1(\u22121) labels valley K (K\u02dc). The Hamiltonian takes into account asymmetry\n\u2206 = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1 between on-site energies in the two layers, \u01eb2 = 12\u2206, \u01eb1 = \u2212 12\u2206.\nAt zero magnetic field, the Hamiltonian H has four valley-degenerate bands [7], \u01eb(\u03b1)\u00b1 (p),\n\u03b1 = 1, 2, with\n\u01eb(\u03b1)2 =\n\u03b321\n2\n+\n\u22062\n4\n+\n(\nv2 +\nv23\n2\n)\np2\n+(\u22121)\u03b1\n[(\n\u03b321 \u2212 v23p2\n)2\n4\n+ v2p2\n[\n\u03b321 +\u2206\n2 + v23p\n2\n]\n+ 2\u03be\u03b31v3v\n2p3 cos 3\u03c6\n]1\/2\n, (2)\nWill be inserted by the editor 3\nwhere p = p(cos\u03c6, sin\u03c6) is the momentum near the K point. They are plotted in Fig. 1(b) for\n\u2206 = 0 and v3\/v = 0.1. The dispersion \u01eb\n(2)\n\u00b1 describes two bands with energies \u01eb\n(2)\n+ \u2265 \u03b31 and\n\u01eb\n(2)\n\u2212 \u2264 \u03b31: they do not touch at the K point. These bands are the result of strong interlayer\ncoupling \u03b3A2B1 \u2261 \u03b31 which forms \u2018dimers\u2019 from pairs of A2-B1 orbitals that lie directly below\nand above each other [7].\nThe dispersion \u01eb1(p) describes low energy bands that touch at the K point in the absence\nof layer asymmetry \u2206 = 0. In the intermediate energy range, 14\u03b31(v3\/v)\n2, |\u2206| < |\u01eb1| < \u03b31, it\ncan be approximated [7] with\n\u01eb\n(1)\n\u00b1 \u2248 \u00b1 12\u03b31\n[\u221a\n1 + 4v2p2\/\u03b321 \u2212 1\n]\n.

(4)\nEq. (3) interpolates between a linear spectrum \u01eb(1) \u2248 vp at high momenta and a quadratic\nspectrum \u01eb(1) \u2248 p2\/2m, where m = \u03b31\/2v2. Such a crossover happens at p \u2248 \u03b31\/2v, which\ncorresponds to the carrier density n\u2217 \u2248 \u03b321\/(4\u03c0~2v2).

Using experimental\ngraphite values [22] gives n\u2217 \u2248 4.36 \u00d7 1012cm\u22122 and n(2) \u2248 3.49 \u00d7 1013cm\u22122. The estimated\neffective mass m is light: m = \u03b31\/2v\n2 \u2248 0.054me.\n3 Optical absorption of bilayer graphene\nThe electromagnetic (EM) field absorption in graphene at zero magnetic field has already been\nstudied [24,18,25,26]. While the DC conductivity of monolayer graphene increases linearly\nwith the carrier density [1,2,27], the real part of its high-frequency conductivity [24,25] is\nindependent of the electron density in a wide spectral range above the threshold ~\u03c9 > 2|\u01ebF|,\nwhich determines a featureless absorption coefficient g1 = \u03c0e\n2\/~c. In contrast, we show that\nthe bilayer absorption coefficient,\ng2 = (2\u03c0e\n2\/~c) f2(\u03c9), (5)\nreflects the presence and dispersion of two pairs of bands [18,19] as described in Section 2.\nIn a 2D electron gas with conductivity \u03c3(\u03c9) \u226a c\/2\u03c0, absorption of an EM field E\u03c9 =\n\u2113Ee\u2212i\u03c9t with polarisation \u2113 [\u2113\u2295 =\n\u221a\n1\n2 [lx \u2212 ily] for right- and \u2113\u2296 =\n\u221a\n1\n2 [lx + ily] for left-hand\ncircularly polarised light arriving along the direction antiparallel to a magnetic field] can be\ncharacterised by the absorption coefficient g \u2261 EiE\u2217j \u03c3ij(\u03c9)\/S: the ratio between Joule heating\nand the energy flux S = cE\u00d7H\/4\u03c0 = \u2212Slz transported by the EM field.

Here\nwe have included spin and valley degeneracy.\nFor a 2D gas in a zero magnetic field, the electron states are weakly scattered plane waves.\nUsing the plane wave basis and the matrix form of the bilayer Hamiltonian H Eq.

The above result agrees with the calculation by J.\nNilsson et al [18] taken in the clean limit and T=0. The frequency dependence [29] of the\nbilayer optical absorption is illustrated in Fig.2, where an additional structure in the vicinity of\n~\u03c9 = \u03b31 (\u03b31 \u2248 0.4eV [22]) is due to the electron-hole excitation between the low-energy band \u01eb(1)\u00b1\nand the split band \u01eb\n(2)\n\u00b1 . For the higher photon energies, ~\u03c9 & 2\u03b31, the frequency dependence\nalmost saturates at f \u2248 1. Over the entire spectral interval shown in Fig.2, the absorption\ncoefficient for the left- and right-handed light are the same, so that Eq. (6) is applicable [28] to\nlight linearly polarised in the graphene plane.\nWe can also examine the reflection and transmission properties of graphene by including the\nimaginary part of the conductivity into our analysis.

This two component Hamiltonian was derived in [7] using Green\u2019s\nfunctions. Alternatively (and equivalently), one can view the eigenvalue equation of the four\ncomponent Hamiltonian Eq. (1) as producing four simultaneous equations for components \u03c8A1,\n\u03c8B2, \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1. Eliminating the dimer state components \u03c8A2, \u03c8B1 by substitution, and treating\n\u03b31 as a large energy, gives the two component Hamiltonian [7] describing effective hopping\nbetween the A1-B2 sites:\nH\u02c62 = \u2212 1\n2m\n(\n0\n(\n\u03c0\u2020\n)2\n\u03c02 0\n)\n+ h\u02c6w + h\u02c6a; (10)\nh\u02c6w = \u03bev3\n(\n0 \u03c0\n\u03c0\u2020 0\n)\n, where \u03c0 = px + ipy;\nh\u02c6a = \u2212\u03be\u2206\n[\n1\n2\n(\n1 0\n0 \u22121\n)\n\u2212 v\n2\n\u03b321\n(\n\u03c0\u2020\u03c0 0\n0 \u2212\u03c0\u03c0\u2020\n)]\n.\nThe effective Hamiltonian H\u02c62 is applicable within the energy range |\u01eb| < 14\u03b31. In the valley\nK, \u03be = +1, we determine \u03a8\u03be=+1 = (\u03c8A1, \u03c8B2), whereas in the valley K\u02dc, \u03be = \u22121, the order of\ncomponents is reversed, \u03a8\u03be=\u22121 = (\u03c8B2, \u03c8A1). The Hamiltonian H\u02c62 describes two possible ways\nof A1\u21cb B2 hopping. The first term takes into account A1\u21cb B2 hopping via the A2B1 dimer\nstate. Consider A1 to B2 hopping as illustrated with the thick solid line in Fig. 1(a). It includes\nthree hops between sites: an intralayer hop from A1 to B1, followed by an interlayer transition\nvia the dimer state B1A2, followed by an intralayer hop from A2 to B2. Since the two intralayer\nhops are both A to B, the first term in the Hamiltonian contains \u03c02 or (\u03c0\u2020)2 on the off-diagonal\nwith the mass m = \u03b31\/2v\n2 reflecting the energetic cost \u03b31 of a transition via the dimer state.\nThis term in the Hamiltonian yields a parabolic spectrum \u01eb = \u00b1p2\/2m with m = \u03b31\/2v2. It\nhas been noticed [7] that quasiparticles described by it are chiral: their plane wave states are\neigenstates of an operator \u03c3n2 with \u03c3n2 = 1 for electrons in the conduction band and \u03c3n2 = \u22121\nfor the valence band, where n2(p) = (cos(2\u03c6), sin(2\u03c6)) for p = (p cos\u03c6, p sin\u03c6). Quasiparticles\ndescribed by the first term in H\u02c62 acquire a Berry phase 2\u03c0 upon an adiabatic propagation along\na closed orbit, thus charge carriers in a bilayer are Berry phase 2\u03c0 quasiparticles, in contrast\nto Berry phase \u03c0 particles in the monolayer of graphene [5].\nThe second term h\u02c6w in the Hamiltonian Eq. (10) describes weak direct A1B2 coupling,\n\u03b3A1B2 \u2261 \u03b33 \u226a \u03b31, the effect of which will be discussed in Section 6. Other weaker tunneling\nprocesses [21] are neglected. The term h\u02c6a takes into account a possible asymmetry between the\ntop and bottom layers (thus opening a gap \u223c \u2206) that will be described in Section 5.\n6 Will be inserted by the editor\nA 1\nB 2\nB 1\nv\nv A 2\nB 1\ng 1\nA 2\nA 1\nB 2\n( a )\ng 1\n1\n2\nv p \/ g 1\ne \/ g 1\n21- 1- 2\n- 1\n- 2\n( b )\nD\n- D \/ 2\n+ D \/ 2\nD\nD\n~\ne\n( 2 )\ne\n( 1 )\ne\n( 1 )\ne\n( 2 )\n+\n+\n-\n-\nFig. 3.

The electronic bands near the K point,\nEq. (2), are shown in Fig. 3(b) for a large value of the layer asymmetry \u2206.

(12)\nFor huge values of the asymmetry |\u2206| \u226b \u03b31, the gap saturates at \u2206\u02dc \u2248 \u03b31 although for modest\nasymmetry values |\u2206| \u226a \u03b31, the relation is simply \u2206\u02dc \u2248 |\u2206|.\nThe electronic densities on the individual layers, n1 and n2, are given by an integral with\nrespect to momentum p = ~ |k| over the circularly symmetric Fermi surface, taking into account\nthe relative weight of the wave functions:\nn1(2) =\n2\n\u03c0~2\n\u222b\np dp\n(\u2223\u2223\u03c8A1(2) (p)\u2223\u22232 + \u2223\u2223\u03c8B1(2) (p)\u2223\u22232) , (13)\nwhere we have included a factor of four to take into account spin and valley degeneracy.

(15)\n5.2 Stability of a gapless bilayer\nWe establish the stability of an undoped, gapless bilayer system with respect to the opening of\na gap in the absence of external electric fields. This is done by estimating the energetic cost of\nopening a gap as determined by the charging energy Ec and comparing it with the energetic\ngain of opening a gap as given by the single particle energy E.\nWe estimate the charging energy by assuming that the excess electronic densities on the\nindividual layers, n1 and n2, are uniformly distributed within infinitesimally thin 2d layers.\nThen, the charging energy is Ec = Q\n2\/2Cb where Q = en1L\n2 = \u2212en2L2 is the excess charge\non one of the layers in the presence of finite asymmetry \u2206 = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1, and Cb = \u03b5r\u03b50L2\/c0 is\nthe capacitance of a bilayer with interlayer separation c0 and area L\n2. For an undoped system,\nwith Fermi energy \u01ebF = 0 and zero excess total density n1 = \u2212n2, we only need to consider the\nvalence bands \u01eb\n(1)\n\u2212 and \u01eb\n(2)\n\u2212 , Eq. (11). On integrating Eq. (14) from zero momentum to a large\nmomentum p\u221e, and using an expansion in \u2206\/\u03b31, we find that the change in the density of the\nvalence bands for finite \u2206, as compared to \u2206 = 0, is\nn1(2) \u2248 \u00b1\n\u03b31\u2206\n4\u03c0~2v2\nln\n(\n4\u03b31\n|\u2206|\n)\n. (16)\nThus, on opening a gap in the spectrum, the charging energy may be estimated as\nEc \u2248 e\n2\n32\u03c02Cb\n(\nL2\u03b31\u2206\n~2v2\n)2\nln2\n(\n4\u03b31\n|\u2206|\n)\n. (17)\nThe change in the single particle energy for finite \u2206, as compared to \u2206 = 0, may be\nestimated by integrating the valence bands energies \u01eb\n(1)\n\u2212 and \u01eb\n(2)\n\u2212 , Eq. (11), with respect to\nmomentum over the circularly symmetric Fermi surface:\nE \u2248 2L\n2\n\u03c0~2\n\u222b\np dp\n[\n\u01eb\n(1)\n\u2212 (\u2206) + \u01eb\n(2)\n\u2212 (\u2206)\u2212 \u01eb(1)\u2212 (0)\u2212 \u01eb(2)\u2212 (0)\n]\n(18)\nOn integrating from zero momentum to a large momentum p\u221e, and expanding in \u2206\/\u03b31, the\nchange in the single particle energy is\nE \u2248 \u2212 \u03b31\n8\u03c0\n(\nL2\u22062\n~2v2\n)[\n1\n2\n+ ln\n(\n4\u03b31\n|\u2206|\n)]\n. (19)\nThe logarithmic dependence of the density Eq. (16) appears as the square of the logarithm\nin the charging energy Eq. (17). Since the single particle energy Eq. (19) contains a single\nlogarithm only, the large energetic cost of charging an undoped bilayer ensures stability with\nrespect to the opening of a gap in the absence of an applied external electric field.\n5.3 Controlling the gap using the electric field effect\nThe gap \u2206\u02dc between the conduction and valence bands arises from layer asymmetry so that,\nin contrast to monolayer graphene, there is a possibility of tuning the magnitude of the gap\nusing external gates.

Schematic of the graphene bilayer, with interlayer separation c0, located a distance d from a\nparallel metallic gate. The gate voltage Vg induces a total excess electronic density n = n1 +n2 on the\nbilayer system where n1 (n2) is the excess density on the layer closest to (furthest from) the gate. The\ndashed line shows a Gaussian surface, from which it can be deduced that the magnitude of the electric\nfield between the layers of the bilayer is E = en2\/\u03b5r\u03b50.\nelectrons n on the bilayer system [1,2,8] and, in general, this will produce a simultaneous change\nin \u2206\u02dc. The dependence of \u2206\u02dc on the density distribution of the bilayer arises from the Coulomb\ninteraction between electrons, but the density distribution itself is dependent on the value of\n\u2206\u02dc via the band structure. In the following we use a self-consistent Hartree approximation to\ndetermine the electronic distribution on the bilayer and the resulting band structure in the\npresence of an external gate.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, we consider the graphene bilayer, with interlayer separation c0, to be\nlocated a distance d from a parallel metallic gate. The application of an external gate voltage\nVg = end\/\u03b5\n\u2032\nr\u03b50 induces a total excess electronic density n = n1 + n2 on the bilayer system\nwhere n1 (n2) is the excess density on the layer closest to (furthest from) the gate [we use the\nSI system of units]. Here \u03b50 is the permittivity of free space, \u03b5\n\u2032\nr is the dielectric constant of the\nmaterial between the gate and the bilayer, and e is the electronic charge. We assume that the\nscreening of the effective charge density \u03c1+ = en from the metallic gate is not perfect, leading\nto an excess electronic density n2 on the layer furthest from the gate. We also assume that\nthe excess densities n1 and n2 are uniformly distributed within infinitesimally thin 2d layers.\nConsidering a Gaussian surface, such as that shown with the dashed lines in Fig. 4, shows that\nthe excess density n2 gives rise to an electric field with magnitude E = en2\/\u03b5r\u03b50 between the\nlayers where \u03b5r is the nominal dielectric constant of the bilayer. There is a corresponding change\nin potential energy \u2206U = e2n2c0\/\u03b5r\u03b50 that determines the layer asymmetry [16]:\n\u2206 (n) = \u01eb2 \u2212 \u01eb1 \u2261 \u22060 + e\n2n2c0\n\u03b5r\u03b50\n. (20)\nIn terms of the capacitance of a bilayer of area L2, Cb = \u03b5r\u03b50L\n2\/c0, this may be written\n\u2206 (n) = \u22060 + e\n2n2L\n2\/Cb. In order to generalise the description, we include a bare asymmetry\nparameter \u22060 to take into account the possibility of finite bilayer asymmetry at zero excess\ndensity that may arise in the presence of a substrate or an additional transverse electric field,\ncreated, for example, by employing multiple gates.\nThe aim of the calculation is to self consistently calculate the excess densities n1, n2, n =\nn1+n2, Eq. (14), and the gap \u2206, Eq. (20). This is done numerically and analytically (the latter\nwithin certain regimes as explained below). The calculation proceeds by first determining the\ninitial density on each layer, n\n(0)\n1 and n\n(0)\n2 , in the absence of an external gate voltage, assuming\nthe Fermi energy to be located at \u01eb = 0. This is done self-consistently by performing the\nintegral Eq.

Then, we proceed to the case where an external gate\nvoltage produces excess total density on the bilayer system. It is convenient to define a Fermi\nenergy \u01ebF and self-consistently determine the density corresponding to it because the value\nof \u01ebF dictates which bands are fully or partially occupied. Note that, when performing the\nmomentum integral Eq. (14) over partially occupied bands, the lower limit is 0 or p\u2212 and the\nupper is p\u2212 or p+, depending on the band in question. This allows a self-consistent calculation\nof the excess densities n1, n2, n = n1 + n2, and of the gap Eq. (20).\nIt is possible to obtain an analytic expression for the asymmetry gap \u2206 in the limit \u03b31, \u01ebF \u226b\n|\u2206| by evaluating the density on each layer Eq. (14) using an expansion in \u2206\/\u03b31. For simplicity,\nwe consider the Fermi energy to lie in the interval |\u2206|\/2 < |\u01ebF | < \u03b31 so that either the band\njust above or just below zero energy is partially occupied. On integrating Eq. (14) from zero\nmomentum to pF = p+, we find the densities in the partially occupied bands to be\nn1(2) \u2248\nsgn (\u01ebF ) p\n2\nF\n2\u03c0~2\n\u00b1 \u03b31\u2206\n2\u03c0~2v2\n[\n\u01eb0\n\u03b31\n+\n\u01eb20\n\u03b321\n\u2212 1\n2\nln\n(\n4\u01eb0\n|\u2206|\n)]\n,\nwhere \u01eb0 = (\u03b31\/2)[\n\u221a\n1 + 4v2p2F \/\u03b3\n2\n1 \u2212 1].

Note that f\u039b(x)\u2192 0 as x\u2192 0 because of the logarithm, meaning that the effectiveness\nof screening increases dramatically at very low density. Note also that, in this calculation, we\nneglected the role of additional weak couplings, such as A1-B2 coupling \u03b33 that results in\ntrigonal warping, Section 6, and is relevant at low density n \u223c 1\u00d7 1011cm\u22122. Indeed, trigonal\nwarping should result in a small overlap between the conduction and valence band of \u2248 2meV.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise, we use c0 = 3.35A\u02da for the interlayer separation and\n\u03b5r = 1 for the dielectric constant of the bilayer [22]. The latter agrees with the prediction for\nother low dimensional structures [30], but is smaller than the value for bulk graphite \u03b5r \u2248 2.4\n[31]. Using typical experimental parameters [22] we find \u039b \u2248 1.3. The numerically calculated\ndependence \u2206(n) is shown in Fig. 5(b) (solid line) for typical experimental parameters in the\ncase that the asymmetry gap \u2206 = 0 at zero excess density and it is compared with the analytic\nexpression (dashed line) Eq. (22). It shows that the addition of density n \u223c 1012cm\u22122 yields a\ngap \u2206 \u223c 10meV.\nThe influence of finite bare asymmetry \u22060 is illustrated in Fig. 6. Naturally, it results in\na finite asymmetry \u2206(0) at zero density but, as a result of screening, the asymmetry at zero\ndensity \u2206(0) is smaller than the bare asymmetry \u22060. Fig. 6(a) shows \u2206(0) as a function of \u22060\nfor two values of the dielectric constant of the bilayer: \u03b5r = 1 (solid line) and \u03b5r = 2 (dashed).\nThis demonstrates that the gap \u2206(0) increases with the dielectric constant, as expected from\nthe screening parameter \u039b = e2L2\u03b31\/(2\u03c0~\n2v2Cb). Figure 6(b) shows a calculation of \u2206(n) using\ntypical experimental parameters [22] for different values of the bare asymmetry \u22060. The main\neffect of finite \u22060 (dashed and dotted lines) is to shift the plot \u2206(n) with respect to the \u22060 = 0\ncase (solid line). Fig. 6(c) shows the variation of the individual layer densities n1 and n2 for\nfinite \u22060.\nRecently, gaps up to 200meV have been achieved by electronic doping [9]. Alternatively, it\nwould be possible to independently control the density and the gap by employing both a top\nand a bottom gate. For example, potential +Vg applied to a bottom gate at a distance d from\nthe bilayer combined with potential \u2212Vg applied to a top gate at a distance d (for simplicity,\nwe consider the symmetric case) would lead to no net density on the bilayer, n2 = \u2212n1, but\na screening of the external gate voltage as in Fig. 6(a) according to Eq. (20), \u2206(0) = \u22060 +\nWill be inserted by the editor 11\nA 1\nB 2\nB 1\nv\nv A 2\nB 1\nA 2\nA 1\nB 2\n( a )\ng 3\n0 . 0 2\nv p \/ g 1\ne \/ g 1( c )\n0 . 0 1\n- 0 . 0 1 0 . 0 1 0 . 0 2\n- 0 . 0 1\n- 0 . 0 2\ng 3\ng 3\ng 3\ng 3\ng 1\ng 1\np x\np y\ne  =  0\ne  =  1 m e V\ne  =  1 0 m e V\n( b )\ng 1 v 3 \/ v 2\nFig. 7.

It leads to the effective velocity v3 =\n(\n\u221a\n3\/2)a\u03b33\/~ where v3 \u226a v that appears in the expression for the energies Eq. (2). In a similar\nway to bulk graphite [21,32], the effect of coupling \u03b33 is to produce trigonal warping, which\ndeforms the isoenergetic lines along the directions \u03d5 = \u03d50, as shown in Fig. 7(b). For the\nvalley K, \u03d50 = 0,\n2\n3\u03c0 and\n4\n3\u03c0, whereas for K\u02dc, \u03d50 = \u03c0,\n1\n3\u03c0 and\n5\n3\u03c0. The effective low energy\nHamiltonian Eq. (10) yields the following energy for \u2206 = 0,\n\u01eb(1)2 \u2248 (v3p)2 \u2212 \u03bev3p\n3\nm\ncos (3\u03c6) +\n(\np2\n2m\n)2\n, (23)\nwhich agrees with Eq. (2) in the low energy limit |\u01eb| \u226a \u03b31. At very low energies |\u01eb| < \u01ebL =\n1\n4\u03b31(v3\/v)\n2 \u2248 1meV, the effect of trigonal warping is dramatic. It leads to a Lifshitz transition:\nthe isoenergetic line is broken into four pockets, which can be referred to as one \u201ccentral\u201d\nand three \u201cleg\u201d parts [32,7]. The central part and leg parts have minimum |\u01eb| = 12 |\u2206| at\np = 0 and at |p| = \u03b31v3\/v2, angle \u03d50, respectively. For v3 \u226a v, we find [7,22] that the\nseparation of the 2D Fermi line into four pockets would take place for very small carrier densities\nn < nL \u223c (v3\/v)2 n\u2217 \u223c 1\u00d7 1011cm\u22122. In this estimation of nL, the constant of proportionality\nis of order 1 as determined by the strongly warped shape of the Fermi line at the Lifshitz\ntransition. For n < nL, the central part of the Fermi surface is approximately circular with area\nAc \u2248 \u03c0\u01eb2\/(~v3)2, and each leg part is elliptical with area A\u2113 \u2248 13Ac. The low energy part of the\nband structure is plotted in Fig. 7(c) along the line py = 0. Taking the line py = 0, Figs. 7(b),(c),\n\u03c6 = 0, at the first valley \u03be = 1 gives \u01eb\n(1)\n\u00b1 = \u00b1|v3p\u2212 p2\/(2m)|. It shows that, at zero energy, the\nleg pocket of the Fermi surface develops at p = 2mv3 = \u03b31v3\/v\n2, Fig. 7(b), and that the overlap\nbetween the conduction and valence bands, Fig. 7(c), is given by 2\u01ebL \u2248 (\u03b31\/2)(v3\/v)2 \u2248 2meV\n[15] using \u03b31 \u2248 0.4eV and v3\/v \u2248 0.1.\n12 Will be inserted by the editor\n7 Conclusions\nWe described the tight binding model of bilayer graphene and the resulting low energy electronic\nband structure. The optical absorption coefficient of a bilayer displays features related to the\nband structure on the energy scale of the order of the interlayer coupling \u03b31 \u2248 0.4eV [18,\n19], in contrast to the featureless absorption coefficient of monolayer graphene. At much lower\nenergies, \u01ebL \u223c 1meV, trigonal warping of the band structure has a dramatic effect, producing a\nLifshitz transition in which the isoenergetic line about each valley is broken into four pockets.\nLayer asymmetry creates a gap between the conduction and valence bands: bilayer graphene\nis a semiconductor with a tuneable gap of up to about 0.4eV. However, by comparing the\ncharging energy with the single particle energy, it is possible to show that an undoped, gapless\nbilayer is stable with respect to the spontaneous opening of a gap. A simple self consistent\nHartree approximation was used to take into account screening an external gate, employed\nprimarily to control the density n of electrons on the bilayer, resulting in a density dependent\ngap \u2206(n). For the typical experimental range of densities shown in Fig. 5(b) the dependence of\nthe asymmetry gap \u2206(n) is roughly linear with n with the addition of density n \u223c 1012cm\u22122\nyielding a gap \u2206 \u223c 10meV. Control of the gap has been modelled using the tight binding model\n[16,17,12] and such calculations appear to be in good agreement with ARPES measurements\n[9], observations of the quantum Hall effect [17], and density functional theory calculations\n[12]. The use of a single gate modulates the density and the gap simultaneously, but it should\nbe possible to independently control the density and the gap by employing both a top and a\nbottom gate. This suggests a route to new nanoelectronic devices defined within a single sheet\nof gated bilayer graphene.\nThe authors thank I. Aleiner, A. K. Geim, K. Kechedzhi, P. Kim, K. Novoselov, and\nL. M.
