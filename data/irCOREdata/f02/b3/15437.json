The purpose of the present paper is to \nreview the more recent developments in the field of leader-member exchange (LMX) theory \nto identify specific issues related to leader-member agreement and follower consensus that \nhave potentially important theoretical and practical implications.  We introduce the concept of \nLMX excellence, which involves high-quality LMX, high leader-member agreement as well \nas high group consensus in LMX quality.  We outline how leaders and followers\u2019 behaviour \nas well as context can enhance or hinder the development of LMX excellence and conclude \nwith an overview of the practical and theoretical implications as well as future research needs. \n \nRelationship-based leadership   3 \n \nThe relationship quality that develops between leaders and those designated as followers \ncontinues to be a significant topic of interest for leadership researchers and practitioners.  \nAlthough the leader is the typical focus in much of the leadership-related research (e.g., leader \npersonality traits, behaviours, styles, decisions, and so on), there is longstanding attention to \nthe interactions between leaders and followers in forming and maintaining leadership \nprocesses going back to the influential early work of Weber (1921-22).  Although leadership \nresearch has advanced beyond Weber, this attention continues to evolve in terms of promoting \na more systematic approach to relational or relationship-based leadership (Uhl-Bien, 2006).  \nThe most prominent approach that focuses on leader-follower relationships is that of Leader-\nMember Exchange (LMX), originally introduced as the Vertical Dyad Linkage model \n(Danserau, Graen, & Haga, 1975).  \nThe explicit focus of LMX is on the quality of the dyadic exchange that develops \nbetween leaders and followers (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995).  The LMX approach was one of the \nfirst systematic leadership theories to include the follower in leadership processes.  Although \none focus is on the reciprocal exchange between a leader and a follower, the theory also \nacknowledges that both parties contribute to the development and maintenance of the ongoing \nrelationship quality.  Meta-analytic research has shown that high quality relationships are \nassociated with positive work-related outcomes, such as follower satisfaction, commitment, \nand performance (Gerstner & Day, 1997) as well as citizenship behaviour (Ilies, Nahrgang, & \nMorgeson, 2007).  \nMuch of the research focus has concentrated on antecedents and outcomes of LMX at \nthe individual or dyadic level, but recently has advanced to the team level (Naidoo, \nScherbaum, & Goldstein, 2008).  However, there are possible differences between leader and \nmember perspectives on the same relationship (although see Graen & Schiemann, 1978; \nRelationship-based leadership   4 \nGraen, Hui, & Taylor, 2006) as well as lack of consensus among followers of the same leader \nregarding their LMX with this leader.  Potential reasons for this will be addressed in the \nfollowing brief overview of the issues related to agreement and consensus, and their \nrespective roles in achieving LMX excellence. \nLMX agreement.  The focus of much of the LMX research to date has been on \nexamining followers\u2019 perspectives of the shared exchange. This has created an asymmetry in \nthe available research base with research on leaders\u2019 perspectives or the shared perceptions of \nleaders and followers being underrepresented.  That does not mean that leaders\u2019 perspectives \nhave been completely ignored, but data from the Gerstner and Day (1997) meta-analyses \nreveals that whereas 69 samples were identified that measured LMX from followers\u2019 or \nmembers\u2019 perspectives only 22 samples were identified using the leaders\u2019 LMX ratings.  \nBecause a leader and follower experience a mutually shared dyadic relationship, perhaps it \nwould be expected that there would be a reasonably high level of agreement between their \nperspectives as measured by independent LMX ratings.  Thus, measuring LMX from only one \nperspective might make sense.  But in the 24 identified samples identified by Gerstner and \nDay (1997) that measured LMX from both perspectives, an average sample-weighted \ncorrelation of only .29 was found. More recently, Sin, Nahrgang, and Morgeson (in press) \nidentified 64 samples that measured LMX from both the leader and follower perspectives. \nThose findings estimated a true score correlation of .37 between perspectives.  These results \nindicate that there is only modest relationship between measurement perspectives even with a \nlarger number of study samples.  \nIt should be noted that the correlation between leader and follower LMX ratings does \nnot indicate interchangeability (see Bliese, 2000). That is, the correlation does not guarantee \nthat leader and follower values are the same, only that they are related. In order for leader-\nmember agreement to be established, it is necessary that leaders and members rate their \nRelationship-based leadership   5 \nmutual relationship equally. We thus define LMX agreement as leaders and followers rating \ntheir relationship equally high or low and not that there is merely a high correlation between \nthem.  \nThe lack of agreement about a shared relationship quality might be considered as one \nindicator of an \u201cimpoverished relationship\u201d (George Graen, personal communication) in that \nthe expectations that a given leader and a follower would have of each other would be \ninconsistent in cases of LMX disagreement. Research suggests that the imbalance in LMX \nmeasurement perspectives found in Gerstner and Day\u2019s meta-analysis can be overcome, as \nrecent findings have identified specific correlates and even some of the causes of LMX rating \n(dis)agreement (Graen et al. , 2006). \nLMX consensus.  LMX theory has evolved based on the fundamental assumption that \nleadership is potentially different for each leader-follower relationship.  As such it does not \nmake theoretical or practical sense to use average leadership style to describe the behaviour \nof any given leader because a leader\u2019s behaviour is likely to differ depending on the follower \n(Dansereau et al., 1975; Graen, 1976).  Leaders treat followers differently according to LMX \ntheory and followers do not always see their leader in the same way.  Consequently, the issue \nof consensus among followers in the same workgroup may be especially relevant to LMX \nresearch.  Although traditional leadership approaches that emphasized an average leadership \nstyle would expect to find consensus in a workgroup (followers agreeing on their view of the \nleader\u2019s behaviour), LMX theory makes no such claim.  Empirical research also supports this \nbasic assumption of LMX theory that there is significant variance in follower ratings of their \nrelationship with the same leader (Graen, 1976; Hofmann, Morgeson, & Gerras, 2003). \nDefining LMX excellence.  Previous research that has not considered agreement and \nconsensus has insufficiently addressed the prescriptions of LMX theory.  Early LMX \nresearchers argued that the most desirable set of workgroup relations is when the leader \nRelationship-based leadership   6 \nnegotiates high-quality exchanges with all followers (Graen, Novak, & Sommerkamp, 1982; \nGraen & Uhl-Bien, 1995).  Thus, LMX theory goes beyond merely attempting to describe \nleader-member relationships to offering prescriptions regarding the ideal state of affairs in the \ngroup.  The present approach takes these prescriptions further in recommending that LMX \nexcellence consists of three parts (a) a high-quality exchange relationship, (b) leader-follower \nagreement on this relationship, and (c) consensus among followers in a workgroup regarding \ntheir respective relationships with the leader.  The three prescriptions of LMX excellence \nproposed here of high level, high agreement, and high consensus, provide an overarching goal \nset that every workgroup leader should work towards.   \nDespite these LMX prescriptions, the emphasis of most of the extant research has been \non the individual and dyadic level.  As a result researchers know little with regard to what \nfactors help to shape LMX agreement and consensus.  Because of their proposed role in \nshaping LMX excellence, we will take a closer look at certain factors that can serve as \ncatalysts for reaching LMX agreement and building consensus. We will refer to positive \nagreement and positive consensus in this overview as components of LMX excellence. We \nuse this terminology to indicate that agreement and consensus should be directed at high level \nof LMX quality rather than agreement and consensus regardless of the respective level of \nLMX. \nAn overarching purpose of the present paper is to review the more recent developments \nin the field of LMX with regard to specific issues of agreement and consensus that have \npotentially important theoretical and practical implications.  In particular, we review the \nresearch and existing theory on how and why leaders and followers work to develop and \nenrich the quality of their shared relationship (or not), how consensus in a work group can \ndevelop, and various contextual factors that might influence agreement and consensus.  We \nwill concentrate specifically on characteristics of the leader, characteristics of the follower(s), \nRelationship-based leadership   7 \nand contextual or situational factors when forwarding propositions on how to achieve LMX \nexcellence.  Our goal is to help establish an agenda for future research in the area of LMX \nagreement and consensus while taking into account relevant contextual variables.  In order to \nprovide the appropriate background and framing for this discussion of agreement and \nconsensus, we will first provide a brief overview of LMX theory. \nBrief Overview of LMX Theory \nWork-based relationships, especially those involving a superior, are important \nconsiderations in any organisational context.  Gerstner and Day (1997) noted that one\u2019s \nrelationship with a leader or boss is a lens through which the entire work experience is \nviewed.  In relationship-based leadership theories such as LMX any differences in the \nevaluation of the same leader\u2019s behaviour are thought to reflect real differences in the \nrelationship between leader and follower.  This implies that a leader\u2019s behaviour often varies \namong a group of followers as a function of different interpersonal relationship qualities that \ndevelop between the leader and followers (Sherony & Green, 2002).  Consequently, \nrelationship qualities will likely differ between followers of the same leader.  The relationship \nquality between leader and member can be described using several quality indicators or \ncurrencies of exchange (Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Liden & Maslyn, 1998), namely affect or \nmutual liking, loyalty or faithfulness across situations, contribution in terms of effort and \nsupport, and respect in the form of a personal reputation for excellence.  \nIt is thought that an important resource embedded in a high-quality LMX relationship \nquality is reciprocity.  According to Liden, Sparrow, and Wayne (1997): \u201cA high-quality \nLMX relationship is based on social exchange, meaning that the leader and member must \ncontribute resources valued by the other party and both parties must view the exchange as \nfair\u201d (p. 50).  Uhl-Bien and Maslyn (2003) differentiated between three components of \nreciprocal behaviour: (a) immediacy (time lapse between exchanges), (b) equivalence \nRelationship-based leadership   8 \n(equality of the exchange value to each party), and (c) interest motive (why an exchange was \nnegotiated).  In an empirical test of this perspective on reciprocity, they found that immediacy \nand equivalence were negatively related to follower- as well as leader-rated LMX, indicating \na certain level of trust in the exchange that makes reciprocity on those dimensions less \nrelevant.  Nonetheless, it should also be noted that mutual interest was positively related to \nLMX perceptions, highlighting the importance of that reciprocity component in developing \nhigh-quality exchanges.  \nRecommendations have been made to researchers that a complete evaluation of LMX \ntheory requires at minimum that the leader and member independently rate their mutual \nrelationship (Gerstner & Day, 1997).  Differences in perspectives could be an interesting \nvariable of study in their own right, especially if it is thought that relationships in which there \nis mutual agreement about the high quality are different than those in which the quality or \nagreement is low or mixed (Cogliser, Schriesheim, Scandura, & Gardner, in press; \nScherbaum, Naidoo, & Ferreter, 2007).  A related question that has emerged in the LMX \nliterature is whether dyads can be considered as dependent or independent from each other.  \nYammarino and Dansereau (2002) argue that all dyadic relationships maintained by a given \nsupervisor are unique and therefore independent from each other; however, Graen and \nScandura (1987) see dyads as mutually dependent.  Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) have \ndescribed the development of LMX research as moving from an individual to a dyadic to a \nteam network perspective.  If a network approach is truly where LMX research is heading \n(e.g., Graen & Graen, 2007, 2008; Sparrowe & Liden, 2005), then greater attention will need \nto be paid to the overall social context and how it influences the development of various \ndyadic exchanges. \nThese differing perspectives on the relative independence of dyads in a workgroup \nsuggest that there is also little apparent theoretical agreement on the degree to which group \nRelationship-based leadership   9 \ncontext is a relevant factor in shaping LMX quality.  If dyads are dependent upon each other \nthen the implication is that group context is especially important; however, if they are \nindependent of each other then the broader work group context would not play an important \nrole with regard to any one particular dyadic relationship quality.  This is an area in which \nadditional research is sorely needed. \nAs noted previously, we see the perception of a high-quality LMX relationship on the \npart of the follower to be the baseline or first step in the development of LMX excellence.  \nBut reaching excellence goes beyond one person\u2019s perception of that relationship (individual \nlevel) to also include a leader\u2019s agreement about the high quality (dyadic level) and also a \ngeneral workgroup consensus on high quality relationships across all of the respective leader-\nmember dyads (group level).  In helping to further promote this idea and encourage more \nresearch on the topics of LMX agreement and consensus, we will first review what is known \nfrom the research literature about these concepts and then propose sets of leader, follower, \nand situational variables as other possible avenues to explore. \nPrior Research on Agreement and Consensus \nRecent chapters from an edited series devoted to LMX theory and research (Graen, \n2003b, 2004, 2006; Graen & Graen, 2005, 2007, 2008) highlight the importance of going \nbeyond a dyad perspective of LMX to also take into account how LMX dyads are embedded \nin groups and in the broader organisational context (e.g., Mayer & Piccolo, 2006).  For years \nresearchers treated the LMX ratings of leaders as independent data across a set of followers \neven though this created nesting or non-independence in the data.  Consequently, the notion \nthat followers are nested within leader dyads and that these dyads are also nested in \nworkgroups has not been fully appreciated until recently (for recent exceptions see Graen\u2019s \nedited LMX series). \nRelationship-based leadership   10 \nA recent exception to this is research by Offstein, Madhavan, and Gnyawali (2006) who \nintroduced a triad level of analysis.  Their approach takes into account that leaders negotiate \nthe quality of exchanges with more than one follower and that followers also have a \nrelationship with each other that has potentially important implications for LMX (also see \nSherony & Green, 2002).  These recent contributions emphasise that relationship dyads \nshould not be regarded in isolation but have to be put into a broader context. In the following, \nwe will briefly review prior research that has focused specifically on issues of LMX \nagreement and consensus.  \nAgreement \nIn theory, it would be expected that leaders and followers would strongly agree on the \nquality of their shared relationship.  But as noted previously, empirical research has shown \nthat this is not the case (Gerstner & Day, 1997).  Recent research found that this lack of \nagreement may be due in part to the realization that relationships need to develop and that this \nmay take more than just time together.  Graen et al. (2006) found that over six-months \nworking on a shared project that engineers showed little or no agreement between leaders and \nmembers regarding dyadic relationship quality.  They argue that relational quality takes time \nto develop between people who have not worked together and it can change dynamically as \nthe relationship is challenged. This \u201cchallenge of commitment\u201d may occasion the testing of \nreciprocal LMX between leader and members and hence improve agreement within dyads. \nSome see this as key to the development of LMX agreement (George Graen, personal \ncommunication).  \nUsing a sample of 98 matched dyads, Sin et al. (in press) found that the correlation \nbetween leader and follower rated LMX increased with length of tenure and as the amount of \ndyadic intensity increased.  These authors also used meta-analytic techniques to evaluate \npotential antecedents of LMX agreement across studies.  Across 64 studies and nearly 11,000 \nRelationship-based leadership   11 \ndyads, the average corrected correlation was found to be moderate (\u0001 = .37).  Furthermore, it \nwas confirmed that relationship tenure was positively associated with the correlation between \nleader and follower rated LMX, and that this correlation was higher on the affectively \noriented relationship dimensions.  These are promising findings; however, more still needs to \nbe known about how relationship tenure shapes agreement as we defined it above in terms of \nleaders and followers rating their relationship equally high or low, and why and how \naffectively oriented dimensions of LMX are associated with higher levels of agreement. \nTwo recent studies on LMX agreement suggest that we may need to further refine what \nis meant by agreement.  Glibkowski, Chaudhry, and Wayne (2007) differentiated between \nmutuality and reciprocity in LMX relationships, building on research that has been conducted \nin the area of psychological contracts (e.g., Dabos & Rousseau, 2004).  Specifically, \nmutuality refers to a shared understanding when one person is the recipient of the exchange \n(e.g., leader and follower both agree on the followers\u2019 workplace contributions) whereas \nreciprocity refers to the degree of agreement about the reciprocal exchange (e.g., leader and \nfollower agree on what they are both getting from the exchange relationship).  The empirical \nfocus of their study was on what the authors termed objective reciprocity that involved a \ncomparison of separate leader and follower ratings about the relationship.  No evidence was \nfound for LMX objective reciprocity in their sample of manufacturing employees in that on \naverage the supervisors reported more resources received from their employees as compared \nto what employees reported they received from their supervisors.   \nCogliser et al. (in press) investigated issues associated with different types of leader-\nmember agreement.  They drew a theoretical and empirical distinction between balanced \nLMX dyads characterised by high exchange quality and balanced LMX dyads characterised \nby low exchange quality.  They further distinguished between different types of unbalanced \ndyads, specifically, follower over- or underestimation of LMX quality relative to their \nRelationship-based leadership   12 \nleader\u2019s view.  Their results suggested that in balanced high-exchange dyads, the followers \ndemonstrated better performance and stronger commitment and job satisfaction than in \nbalanced low-exchange dyads.  In unbalanced dyads where leaders and followers disagreed on \ntheir shared relationship quality, follower overestimation was characterised by lower follower \nperformance but higher commitment and higher job satisfaction as compared to conditions of \nfollower underestimation.   \nPaglis and Green (2002) demonstrated that high LMX agreement was related to lower \nfrequency of conflict between leader and followers.  In a theoretical paper, Basik and \nMartinko (2008) developed propositions concerning unbalanced dyads in terms of follower \nunderestimation that are consistent with the findings of Cogliser et al. (in press).  Basik and \nMartinko also suggest that balanced dyads (either high-high or low-low) will experience \nlower conflict and that high-exchange balanced dyads will result in higher follower \nperformance and commitment.  Again, these propositions are much in line with what has been \ndemonstrated previously by Paglis and Green as well as Cogliser et al. \nAlthough these articles point to the importance of considering separately the differences \nbetween balanced and unbalanced dyads in terms of follower outcomes, this practice is the \nexception rather than the rule.  We have argued that agreement on a shared high-quality \nexchange is an important step in achieving LMX excellence but the reality is that very little \nresearch has been conducted on the consequences of disagreement in LMX ratings.  A key \nquestion that remains largely unanswered concerns the possible reasons behind leader-\nmember agreement or disagreement, especially those that go beyond just considering the \ntenure of the relationship.  Though not much research is available in this area, some \ntheoretical considerations are worth mentioning.  Cogliser et al. (in press) discuss a few \npossibilities that might contribute to disagreement or unbalanced dyads such as follower \ndispositions (e.g., negative affectivity, locus of control), cognitive processes stemming from \nRelationship-based leadership   13 \ndifferences in implicit leadership theories, relational dynamics such as the lack of mutual \nexpectations, and contextual factors such as span of leadership.   \nOther researchers have approached the problem of leader-member disagreement from a \npsychometric perspective on the ratings themselves.  Scherbaum and his colleagues (2007) \nfound that the LMX-SLX was psychometrically sound when using item analysis theory for \nleaders (down), members (up), and peer-ratings (across) (Scherbaum et al., 2007).  Tekleab \nand Taylor (2003) reported that leaders tend to report a higher overall mean and lower \nvariation in their LMX ratings than followers. This could contribute to a low correlation \nbetween leader and follower ratings of LMX and provide evidence of LMX disagreement as \nleader and follower report different mean levels of their relationship quality. Gerstner and \nDay (1997) noted overall lower reliability for leader than for member LMX ratings.  Keeping \nin mind that leaders often have to rate several followers, the validity of these ratings may be \naffected as well.  Scandura, Graen, and Novak (1986) proposed that leaders may be reluctant \nto differentiate between their followers and therefore their ratings may be subjected to the \neffects of social desirability and restriction of range.  Other reasons for disagreement derive \nfrom research on 360-degree feedback ratings.  For example, Harris and Schaubroek (1988) \noffered three explanations for low agreement across ratings sources: (a) egocentric bias \n(biases in self-perception in the direction of an inflated self-view), (b) differences in \norganisational level (meaning that people on different hierarchical levels define performance \ndifferently), and (c) observational opportunities (raters have differential opportunities to \nobserve a target ratee).   \nClearly, more research is needed to address this potentially important concern of leader-\nmember (dis)agreement.  After reviewing what the research on consensus reveals, we will \nreturn to this issue in offering our own propositions with the goal of guiding future \nresearchers. \nRelationship-based leadership   14 \nConsensus \nConsensus (sometimes called differentiation) refers to the variability across followers in \na given workgroup with regard to their respective ratings of their relationship with the same \nleader.  One focus of consensus is on the absolute level of alignment in LMX quality across \ndyads within a workgroup, but a somewhat different one includes the followers\u2019 perspectives \nof different dyads within the same group (Van Breukelen, Konst, & van der Vlist, 2002; \nSchyns, 2006).  As noted before in contrast to other leadership approaches, variance in \nfollower ratings is treated as meaningful information in LMX research.  But from prescriptive \nperspective it has been recommended that leaders work to establish a good relationship with \nevery follower (Graen et al., 1982; Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995).  This implies that other things \nbeing equal, high consensus (low variance) along with positive relationship quality (high \nmean) is a desired and effective way of leading (achieving LMX excellence).  A clear \nsituational exception to this was found by Naidoo et al. (2009) who reported a group \nperformance contribution of both team mean and variance on LMX. \nDespite this prescription, the typical way in which leader-member relationships have \nbeen regarded is in isolation from other dyads or the broader organisational context.  This \nmay be inappropriate if dyads are interdependent because the quality of relationship in one \nLMX dyad might influence the LMX quality in another dyad (Graen & Scandura, 1987).  For \nthis reason it is potentially important to take consensus issues into account when evaluating \nLMX outcomes.  The classic work of Heider (1958) also suggests that the independence of \ndyads is unlikely.  Instead, members with positive relationships will probably consider \nmembers with negative relationships sceptically as a means of maintaining a balanced triad \n(member-leader-member), implying that cooperation between these different members maybe \nbe jeopardised.  Conversely, members with relatively poor exchange qualities with their \nleader may view those with excellent LMX with appreciation (if desired) or envy, resentment, \nRelationship-based leadership   15 \nor possibly even anger (if undesired).  As noted below, however, some researchers have \nshown that when the differentiation (low consensus) is perceived to be due to legitimate \nfactors such as ability or motivation level, then there is greater acceptance of different \nrelationship qualities in the group. \nEmpirical research indicates that there is little consensus across follower LMX ratings.  \nHofmann et al. (2003) reported an intra-class correlation coefficient value of .39 for member-\nmember agreement across work-group dyads.  This suggests that approximately 39% of the \nvariance in LMX was explained by group membership, whereas the remaining variance can \nbe explained at the individual level.  Looking into the effects of LMX differentiation (i.e., \nlack of consensus) on performance, Liden, Erdogan, Wayne, and Sparrowe (2006) argued that \nLMX differentiation could actually enhance individual performance when leaders treat \nfollowers differently according to the level of contribution that each provides.  They assume \nthat this will be perceived as equitable treatment by followers.  The counterargument Liden et \nal. set up relates to fairness in the sense that LMX differentiation will lead to poor \nperformance based on followers\u2019 feelings of unfair treatment.  In short, the theoretical \narguments appear to cut both ways.  Empirically, however, these researchers found no \nrelationship between LMX differentiation and individual performance. \nLiden et al. (2006) argued further that LMX differentiation is positively related to \nindividual performance for low (impoverished) LMX groups but not for high (excellent) \nLMX groups.  Their assumption is based on the idea that in low LMX groups, differentiation \ncan convey the feeling that an enhanced relationship with the supervisor is possible whereas \nin high LMX groups, differentiation may be less important as all members enjoy a good \nrelationship quality with their leader.  Their results supported this assumption.  \nIn terms of group performance, Liden et al. (2006) argue for two opposing relationships: \nDifferentiation can lead to high group performance when leaders select the right followers for \nRelationship-based leadership   16 \nthe right task according to their capabilities.  But differentiation can lead to low group \nperformance when followers start to withhold effort as they begin to feel they are treated \nunfairly.  No main effect for LMX differentiation on group performance was found.  In an \neffort to examine this relationship more closely, Liden et al. looked into task interdependence \nand median LMX in the group as potential moderators.  They found that the relationship \nbetween LMX differentiation and group performance is higher under conditions of high task \ninterdependence and low median LMX.  \nMayer, Keller, Leslie, and Hanges (2008) investigated how co-worker LMX influences \nthe relationship between an individual\u2019s LMX and several outcomes.  The theoretical \napproach taken in their research was that because dyads are embedded in groups it is likely \nthat social comparison processes influence the relationship between individual LMX and \noutcomes.  Their results suggested that relationships between individual LMX and job \nsatisfaction and commitment were moderated by co-worker LMX such that the relationships \nwere stronger for high rather than for low co-worker LMX.  This held true for both actual and \nperceived co-worker LMX and for some behavioural indicators such as aspects of \norganisational citizenship behaviour and leader-rated deviance behaviour and performance.  \nIn other related research, van Breukelen and Wesselius (2007) found support for the \nperspective that a leader\u2019s differentiation across members will be viewed negatively by \nfollowers only under certain circumstances.  Using the example of sport teams, the authors \nnoted that differentiation tends to be perceived as fair when players are shown rewarding \ntreatment on the basis of their abilities.  The findings of van Breukelen and Wesselius point to \nan important direction in the research into consensus in LMX: Under what conditions \ndifferentiation is regarded as fair and will lead to positive outcomes (or at least avoid negative \nones) and under what conditions it is regarded as unfair and will likely lead to negative \nconsequences?   \nRelationship-based leadership   17 \nTaken together, these findings suggest that a general effect for LMX consensus may not \nexist, but that it may be more important to look at context effects that influence the \nrelationship between consensus and outcomes.  Specifically, the perception of fairness with \nregard to differentiation appears to be particularly relevant when considering outcomes of \nconsensus in LMX (see Scandura, 1999, for a discussion of the relevance of fairness in \nLMX,).  The reasons for a lack of consensus in how followers view their relationship quality \nwith their leader can be traced back to LMX development.  As leader and member both \ncontribute to the development of the dyadic relationship, it makes sense to take a look at \ncharacteristics of both the leader and follower in the initiation of LMX relationships \nIt is typically assumed that leaders make an offer for a positive exchange quality \nrelationship to followers, who choose to accept or decline this offer (e.g., Graen, 2003a; \nGraen & Scandura, 1987).  Research has shown that the acceptance of an LMX offer may be \nat least partially based on members\u2019 growth need strength (Graen et al., 1982; Graen, \nScandura, & Graen, 1986).  Those followers with strong need for personal growth and \ndevelopment were more likely to accept these LMX offers and increase their hard \nperformance than those low on growth need strength.  Offers also might be rejected because \nof the felt obligation that comes about by entering into this exchange agreement or simply due \nto a lack of interest.  Another possibility that has been discussed in the literature is that leaders \nmay simply not have the resources to establish a good relationship quality with all followers \n(Dansereau et al., 1975; Green, Anderson, & Shivers, 1996; Schriesheim, Castro, & \nYammarino, 2000; Schyns, Paul, Mohr, & Blank, 2005).  This could be a particular problem \nfor leaders with strict organizational rules or a large span of control, contributing to a stronger \ndifferentiation among followers.  A large span of control might also serve as an inhibitor for a \nleader accepting the overtures of followers to develop their working relationship. \nRelationship-based leadership   18 \nAs alluded to above, it is also possible that followers take action to initiate a positive \nrelationship with their leader although this is less frequently considered.  Follower offers may \nbe more likely when they join an existing team as opposed to when a leader is new to a team \nand has the responsibility to establish working relationships with all of the new followers.  \nFollowing on the notion that follower growth need strength may be one factor that influences \nreactions to leader offers and thus shapes the mutual relationship, Schyns, Kroon, and Moors \n(2008) argued that followers may differ in the degree to which they perceive LMX as being \nimportant based on their implicit leadership theories and work-related needs.  Their results \nindicate that followers\u2019 needs are related to their ratings of their relationship quality with their \nleader.  This can be due to differences in expectations towards leaders but also due to real \ndifferences in leader behaviour based on a reaction to followers\u2019 needs.  This implies that \nfollowers reporting to the same leader could very likely report different LMX qualities \ndepending on their needs and implicit leadership theories, thereby resulting in low consensus \nregarding LMX. \nWe next turn our attention to areas to consider in terms of new directions for future \nresearch on LMX agreement and consensus in building toward LMX excellence.  We have \norganized these directions into a set of propositions that take into consideration leader \nbehaviours and attributes, follower behaviours and attributes, and contextual conditions that \ncould enhance agreement and consensus, and along with high quality, contribute to achieving \nLMX excellence.  Our goal was not to try and provide a comprehensive overview of all the \npossible factors that could influence agreement, consensus, and ultimately excellence, but to \nfocus on those that we believe show the most promise for advancing LMX theory and \nresearch. \nFuture Research Directions in Agreement, Consensus, and LMX Excellence \nLMX Agreement and Excellence \nRelationship-based leadership   19 \nWe have noted that most of the research on LMX development has focused on \ndeveloping high-quality dyadic relationships.  Nonetheless, the data suggest that leaders and \nfollowers may not necessarily agree on the quality of their shared relationship (Gerstner & \nDay, 1997; Sin et al., in press).  For that reason, our approach is to suggest potential factors \nthat would enhance LMX agreement.  In terms of going beyond establishing more than a good \nleader-member exchange to possibly achieving leader-member excellence (Graen, 2009), it is \na baseline requirement that both members of the dyad agree on the high-quality nature of their \nmutual relationship.  Research indicates that the more positive the LMX, the higher the \nagreement (Graen, 2003a).  Proposed below are some theoretically relevant factors based on \nthe leader, follower, and situational context respectively that are thought to influence the \ndevelopment of what we term \u201cpositive LMX agreement\u201d (high LMX level and high \nagreement), which helps to foster the achievement of LMX excellence. \nSelf-concepts. One factor influencing leader-member agreement is thought to be the self-\nidentities that both leader and follower hold. Lord and his colleagues (Lord & Brown, 2004; \nLord, Brown, & Freiberg, 1999) built on research from social psychology in decomposing \nself-identity into three dimensions: individual, relational, and collective. Research suggests \nthat these different levels cannot be activated simultaneously. Researchers have proposed that \nmost people have aspects of all three components of self-identity available to them, but that \nsituational factors make one particular level of self-identity salient over the others (Brewer & \nGardner, 1996). These different levels of self-identity are potentially important factors in \nserving as motives that guide attention and behaviour in interpersonal relations (Sedikides & \nBrewer, 2001).  \nWhen individual self-identity is activated, it emphasizes a person\u2019s uniqueness as an \nindividual and serves as motivation to establish and maintain this uniqueness in their relations \nwith others. A relational self-identity is based on dyadic relations with specific others (e.g., a \nRelationship-based leadership   20 \nleader). A collective level of self-identity is defined in terms of broader group membership \n(van Knippenberg & Hogg, 2003a, 2003b; van Knippenberg, van Knippenberg, De Cremer, & \nHogg, 2004). From these brief descriptions of follower self-identity it can be seen how \nholding an individual identity might serve as an obstacle to reaching LMX agreement with a \nleader. This would be especially likely if the follower is motivated primarily to establish his \nor her uniqueness (i.e., individual identity), or if the leader and follower were operating with \ndifferent self-identity levels. Lord et al. (1999) argue that holding a relational self-identity can \nelevate dyadic leader-member relations to greater importance. In particular, holding a \nrelational self-identity would be expected to enhance positive LMX agreement because the \nmotivating factor in social relationships at this level is the dyad and not the individual or the \nwhole group.  \nProposition 1: Leaders\u2019 and followers\u2019 who hold relational identities will have greater LMX \nagreement. \nSome authors have argued that leaders play an important role in influencing follower \nself- concept. For example, Lord and Brown (2004) have claimed that leaders can influence \nfollower motivation by shaping these three levels of their self-identity in different ways at \ndifferent times to best suit the needs of the group in terms of maximizing goal achievement. \nAccording to Brewer and Gardner (1996), situational factors are important in rendering \ndifferent levels of self-identity salient; therefore, leaders can create situations in which \nrelational self-identity is more salient as a way to potentially enhance LMX agreement.  \nProposition 2: Leaders who influence followers to adopt a relational self-identity will \ncontribute to enhancing LMX agreement. \nFollower behaviour and attributes.  LMX was one of the first approaches in leadership \nresearch to formally acknowledge the role of the follower in leadership processes (Graen, \n1976). The orientation taken with this follower role can serve to enhance or impede LMX \nRelationship-based leadership   21 \nagreement and ultimately the level of excellence achieved.  From a behavioural perspective, \nactions taken by a follower to gather information about their role expectations as well as how \nthey are meeting such expectations will be important concerns in developing LMX \nagreement.  It is proposed that actions taken by followers to actively seek out direct and \nindirect feedback cues will help to enhance LMX agreement.   \nFeedback seeking behaviour is a type of self-regulation strategy that involves the degree \nto which an individual asks for feedback from several sources and to monitor the environment \nfor indirect feedback cues (Ashford & Tsui, 1991).  Feedback serves an important \ninformational purpose for followers in terms of understanding role expectations and how well \nthey are meeting those expectations. We expect that feedback not only affects LMX \nagreement but also has a positive effect on the level of LMX, thus enhancing positive LMX \nagreement.   \nProposition 3: Feedback seeking behaviour engaged in by the follower will enhance positive \nLMX agreement with the leader. \nSelf-monitoring. Whereas feedback seeking is a behaviourally based individual \ndifference, there may be dispositional factors that also shape the likelihood that LMX \nagreement will develop with a leader (Cogliser et al., in press).  One such factor that is \nproposed to shape agreement is follower self-monitoring personality.  This refers to the \ndegree that someone monitors and controls the expression of self that they present to others in \nsocial situations (Snyder, 1987). High self monitors are chameleon-like in adjusting their \nattitudes and behaviours to fit with the expectations of others, whereas low self-monitors are \nboth less willing and less able to project images of themselves that differ from their privately \nexperienced self (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000).  The postulated link to LMX agreement is that \nin order to meet the expectations of an important other such as a leader, a follower first must \nknow what those expectations are.  High self-monitors are more likely than lows to be attuned \nRelationship-based leadership   22 \nto the cues provided by a leader as to what is needed to fulfil their expectations for ultimately \nestablishing LMX excellence.  But leaders may not trust the actions of high self-monitors and \nreject their acts as blatant attempts at ingratiation (Lam, Huang, & Snape, 2007). \nProposition 4: Follower self-monitoring personality will be positively related to positive LMX \nagreement with the leader. \nContextual influences on LMX agreement.  There are many potential situational \ninfluences that can alter the amount of feedback or other information that is available to \nfollowers.  There may be some structural concerns such as span of control (i.e., the number of \nfollowers reporting to a particular leader; see Green et al., 1996; Schriesheim et al., 2000; \nSchyns et al., 2005) and whether or not the leader is co-located with the followers. Regardless \nof these particular kinds of structural factors, it is believed that there are deeper issues \nassociated with the climate or the culture of a workgroup that can shape the level of LMX \nagreement that develops.  These aggregate level attributes of a work context are based in the \nnorms that develop among members of that context. Two such factors proposed here are \npsychological safety and power distance. \nPsychological safety refers to the amount of interpersonal trust that is experienced in a \ngiven group or organization context.  When there is a high level of psychological safety \nworkgroup members feel that they can take interpersonal risks with each other and the formal \nleader with little likelihood of being made to feel foolish or stupid (Edmondson, 1999). \nResearch by Edmondson and colleagues has shown that psychological safety is positively \nrelated to the amount of learning that occurs in a team because people in the team are more \nwilling to try new behaviours and to ask for help when needed.  In terms of enhancing LMX \nagreement, it is postulated that workgroups espousing norms that increase individual trust in \nthe leader and facilitate taking interpersonal risks, will provide more direct and indirect \nfeedback about the leader\u2019s expectations.  More feedback in the environment will provide for \nRelationship-based leadership   23 \ngreater opportunities to gather information about those expectations, thus enhancing to \npositive LMX agreement.  \nProposition 5: The level of psychological safety experienced by followers is related to positive \nLMX agreement. \nSimilar to our argument regarding self-identities, we can assume that leaders can and \nshould use their influence to create psychological safety in their team. As Edmondson, \nBohmer, and Pisano (2001) argue, a major influence in shaping the amount of psychological \nsafety is the leader\u2019s orientation to the group.  \nProposition 6: Leaders who build psychological safety in their group will contribute to \nenhancing LMX agreement. \nPower distance was originally discussed as a cultural dimension that differentiates \nacross societies (Hofstede, 2001); however, it can also be used to describe the values held by \nsmaller collectives such as organizations and workgroups.  This particular cultural value \nrefers to the extent that unequal power and status across individuals in the collective are \nacknowledged and accepted.  High power distance cultures more readily accept such \ninequalities among its members, which can interfere with vertical feedback and open \ncommunication between leaders and followers.  For this reason, it is expected that those \nworkgroups in which there is a more egalitarian culture where accessibility to the leader is \nmore likely will foster greater leader-follower LMX agreement. \nProposition 7: The level of power distance experienced in a given context is negatively \nrelated to positive LMX agreement. \nLMX Consensus and Excellence \nSummarising from the available literature, we know that LMX consensus is most likely \nreached when there are three prevailing conditions.  First, a leader makes an offer of \ndeveloping a high-quality exchange to all followers.  Second, followers should be similar to \nRelationship-based leadership   24 \neach other in their exchange needs regarding the leader.  Third, followers have opportunities \nto interact to agree on their relationship with their leader (Graen, 1976; Heider, 1958).  \nAccording to previous research, these factors all work together in shaping high consensus in \nfollower reported LMX and at the same time keep the mean LMX quality on a high level.  \nNonetheless, there are likely additional catalysts to the development of positive LMX \nconsensus (high average LMX and high follower consensus).  Several of these are proposed \nbelow. \nAccording to Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995), leaders need to \u2013 and be able to \u2013 make an \nexchange quality offer to all followers.  This puts the onus of creating positive LMX \nconsensus on the leader.  Although this might be an overly narrow approach to achieving \npositive LMX consensus, it serves as a good starting point to explore this phenomenon.   \nSocial identity. As with LMX agreement, we see the leader\u2019s role in shaping follower \nidentity and behaviour to be a key factor in shaping LMX consensus.  Early work on Social \nIdentity Theory (SIT; Tajfel & Turner, 1986) explored how individuals develop a social \nidentity on the basis of salient aspects of their group identity (e.g., race, gender, or ethnicity) \nand the consequences this has on interactions within and between groups.  In the context of \nleadership, SIT has been used to explain how leaders emerge (Haslam & Platow, 2001) and \nwhy they are granted power (Turner, 2005).  Both results can be achieved by contributing to \nestablishing in followers a feeling of importance of belonging to a particular group.  \nAccording to Haslam et al. (2001), leaders who are seen as enhancing social identity \nwith the group are attributed more charisma and receive more positive evaluations in a crisis \nthan other leaders.  A similar process could be relevant in LMX.  That is, when leaders are \nperceived by their followers as belonging to a cohesive and high-status group, and thus \nenhancing self-identity, followers may be more willing to accept leaders as \u201cone of us\u201d and \nwork to establish a positive relationship with the leader on a group basis. In other words, for a \nRelationship-based leadership   25 \nworkgroup to be characterised by positive LMX consensus, the group itself must be salient as \na source of social identity (also see Haslam, Oakes, Reynolds, & Turner, 1999). Thus, leaders \nneed to (a) help establish a collective group identity within their followers, (b) be seen to be \npart of that group, and (c) make this identity salient when necessary. \nProposition 8: In workgroups with members holding a positive social identity to the group \nthere will be a higher likelihood of positive LMX consensus than in groups in which this is not \nthe case.  \nTransformational leadership. LMX has been theoretically and empirically linked to \ntransformational leadership (Gerstner & Day, 1997; Graen, 2003a; Wang et al., 2005).  \nEmpirically, Basu and Green (1997), Deluga (1994), as well as Howell and Hall-Marenda \n(1999) have shown substantial positive relationships between transformational leadership and \nLMX.  Gerstner and Day (1997) have argued that transformational leadership can be one way \nof establishing positive LMX relationships with all followers.  One component of \ntransformational leadership in particular (i.e., individualised consideration), appears to be \nvery relevant in forging high-quality LMX relationships.  One difficulty in linking \ntransformational leadership with LMX is that the former is traditionally seen to be focused on \nportraying an average leadership style across the whole group of followers.  Nonetheless, \nsome researchers have demonstrated that transformational leaders influence follower \nperformance through LMX (Wang et al., 2005).  Thus, we assume that average leadership \nstyle such as transformational leadership contributes to the development of LMX consensus \nand group excellence. \nProposition 9: In work groups where leaders demonstrate high levels of transformational \nbehaviours there will be a higher probability of positive LMX group consensus than in other \ngroups where the leader shows low transformational behaviours.  \nRelationship-based leadership   26 \nFollower needs.  Even if the leader tries to establish a good relationship quality with \nall followers in the workgroup, there is no guarantee that all followers will accept this \nrelationship offer or even be aware of the offer.  As discussed, research indicates that \nfollowers\u2019 needs play an important role in establishing consensus in LMX.  Specifically, \nfollowers\u2019 needs must be aligned such that they are motivated to establish and maintain a \ngood relationship quality with their leader.  From this perspective, it is likely that deep level \ndiversity, that is dissimilarity in values and needs, (Hiller & Day, 2003) could play a role in \ninhibiting LMX group consensus and excellence.  Followers who are similar in their needs \nand values might be more motivated to establish similar high-quality relationships with their \nleader, whereas those groups in which there is a diverse set of competing needs will have \nmore difficulty with this. However, followers\u2019 needs to not only have to be aligned with the \nother group members\u2019 needs but they also have to be conducive to LMX, in a sense that \nfollowers\u2019 needs enhance the interest in establishing a high level LMX relationship with their \nleader. For example, Graen (2003, see also Graen and Scandura, 1987) indicate that \nfollowers\u2019 growth need strength is related to accepting positive LMX relationships with their \nleaders. Thus, a high level and consensus of growth need strength will enhance consensus in \nLMX.  \nProposition 9: In work groups where followers share needs that are conducive to LMX there \nwill be a higher probability of positive LMX group consensus than in other groups.  \nContextual influences.  Leaders and followers do not interact in a vacuum.  The \norganisational and group context that they share can have an effect on the establishment of \npositive or negative relationship qualities and also influence how many good relationship \nqualities emerge.   \nSpan of leadership has been indicated as a boundary condition for establishing a large \nnumber of high quality relationships (Schyns et al., 2005; Schyns, Maslyn, & Weibler, 2008). \nRelationship-based leadership   27 \nIt has been argued that leaders with a large span of leadership (i.e., responsible for leading \nmany followers) will find it difficult to establish good relationship qualities with all of them. \nThus, although it is difficult to pinpoint the ideal numbers of followers to lead, it is likely that \nsmaller spans of leadership will be more conducive to LMX group consensus than larger \nones.  \nProposition 10: In work groups with a small span of leadership there will be a higher \nprobability of positive LMX group consensus than in other groups where there is a larger \nspan of leadership.  \nClimate. Another factor influencing positive LMX consensus could be organisational \nand group climate.  For example, results of a recent study by Tordera, Gonzalez-Roma, and \nPeiro (2008) indicate that supportive climate is positively related to LMX in general. \nAccording to James and colleagues who have conducted some of the pioneering theoretical \nand empirical theoretical and empirical work in the area of climate, the preferred term when \ndealing with individual perceptions of the workplace environment is psychological climate.  \nAccording to James and James (1989), four dimensions of psychological climate can be \ndistinguished: (a) role stress and lack of harmony; (b) leadership facilitation and support; (c) \nchallenge and autonomy; and (d) workgroup cooperation, friendliness and warmth (see also \nJames et al., 2008). \nThe climate aspect of leadership facilitation and support is very similar to LMX.  But \npsychological climate refers not to dyadic relationships but to the prevalent relationships and \nperceptions within the group as assessed by an individual. If by means of social interaction, \nindividuals come to share their group perceptions, then group climate emerges. That is, \nindividuals within a group agree on their assessment of the prevalent climate. In terms of \nLMX consensus, we argue that if the group climate with respect to leadership facilitation and \nsupport is high, this situation is conducive to positive LMX consensus. \nRelationship-based leadership   28 \nProposition 11: Work groups with a perceived psychological climate emphasising leadership \nfacilitation and support will have higher positive LMX consensus than work groups that have \na relatively low climate for leadership facilitation.  \nCulture. On the broader level of culture (shared beliefs and values), individualism and \ncollectivism can be relevant when establishing relationships.  LMX has been researched \nmainly in individualist cultures, such as the United States and Europe (e.g., Bernerth, \nArmenakis, Feild, Giles, & Walker, 2007; van Breukelen et al., 2002) but it has also been \nexamined in collectivist cultures such as China and Japan (Graen & Wakabayashi, 1994). \nWhile the outcomes of LMX are favourable in both cultural contexts, little is known about the \ninfluence this culture dimension has on LMX consensus.  As collectivist cultures are more \noriented towards the group (Hofstede, 2001) and members are better at decoding social cues \n(Markus & Kitayama, 1991), we can assume that collectivist groups have more shared views \non their relationship quality with their leaders than individualist groups.  However, power \ndistance may be important in determining whether or not this consensus is necessarily \npositive.  In cultures with large power distances, a lot is to be gained from a positive \nrelationship quality with a leader, so that that positive LMX consensus likely can be assumed \n(at least, when it comes to followers\u2019 reports).  In cultures less impacted by high power \ndistance, a positive relationship quality with one\u2019s leader may not be essential; thus, LMX \nlevel may vary more between groups. \nProposition 12: In cultures with high collectivism and high power distance, there will be \nhigher levels of positive LMX group consensus than in cultures low in collectivism and low in \npower distance.  \nSummary and Conclusions: Towards LMX Excellence \nIn this overview we concentrated on two gaps in the literature on LMX, namely the \nantecedents of agreement between leader and member concerning their mutual relationship \nRelationship-based leadership   29 \nand the antecedents of consensus among followers concerning the relationship to their leader.  \nThe call for agreement and consensus in LMX is based on somewhat different arguments.  As \nleaders and followers rate the same exchange quality relationship, the lack of agreement noted \nin the literature is a problem that researchers need to pay close attention to.  But this is not a \nnew problem in that some of the early LMX work focused on the problem of agreement \n(Graen & Schiemann, 1978).  Too often it appears that LMX is measured only from the \nfollowers\u2019 perspective because of convenience.  It should be noted that this is incomplete and \nmay be providing biased LMX data.  As we have noted, an overarching goal should be to \nachieve agreement in LMX and to achieve high level LMX at the same time (what we have \ntermed positive LMX agreement) as a foundation for building LMX consensus and ultimately \nLMX excellence. \nThe case for consensus is slightly different.  The idea of LMX originates in the \nobservation that leaders tend to have different relationships with different followers.  Given \nthe positive outcomes associated with high-quality LMX relationships, it is recommended that \nleaders attempt to forge high-quality relationships with all followers.  Despite this \nprescription, it will likely be much more difficult to implement this than to prescribe it.  High-\nquality exchanges demand extensive resources in terms of social capital outlays to build and \nmaintain in terms of the strong network ties involved.   \nWe have proposed that LMX agreement and consensus are influenced by the leader, the \nfollower(s), and aspects of the work\/organisational context.  Role expectations are important \nboth in terms of leader and follower influences on agreement.  Leaders need to make clear \nwhat their expectations are but followers also need to be active in seeking feedback regarding \ntheir role expectations and to what extent they are fulfilling those expectations according to \nthe leader.  When expectations are clear and shared between a leader and follower, the way is \npaved for a mutually positive understanding of their relationship.  Self-monitoring tendencies \nRelationship-based leadership   30 \ncan enhance this understanding as followers high in self-monitoring are better able and more \nhighly motivated to detect cues in their leader\u2019s behaviour as to their expectations and to work \ntowards meeting them.  We also argue that leaders who establish and make salient positive \nsocial identities and those who appeal to a collective or relational self-identity will ultimately \nachieve higher LMX excellence.  The trick is in knowing how to achieve social identity in a \ngroup and how each level of self-identity should be activated and when to do so.  Our \nsuggestion is to first help to build social identities in order to enhance LMX consensus and \nfollow that with developing followers\u2019 relational self-identities to then build LMX agreement.  \nIt is our contention that followers who emphasise their own uniqueness in the form of having \nan individual level of self-identity activated will show less agreement with their leaders than \nthose whose level of self-identity is more relational.  Similarly, followers whose social \nidentities are not connected to their work group will not likely share their colleagues\u2019 view of \npositive LMX quality because it will not be important to them. \nLeaders\u2019 transformational leadership can also influence consensus as transformational \nleaders tend to engage in individual consideration, a behaviour that can likely enhance LMX.  \nTransformational leaders emphasise the common goal which could in turn positively affect \nsocial identity and thus consensus in LMX.  In order for positive LMX consensus to emerge, \nfollowers must feel the need for a positive relationship with their leader and as a group have a \ncollective need to share this positive relationship.  \nBesides leader and follower characteristics, we identified several contextual factors \ninfluencing LMX excellence.  Climate \u2013 and specifically psychological safety \u2013 can support \nthe development of agreement and consensus by allowing a positive group atmosphere to \nemerge and supporting trust among leaders and followers.  On a broader level, cultural \ndimensions such as power distance and individualism-collectivism can impact on the \npossibilities to establish agreement and consensus in LMX.  In high power distance cultures, \nRelationship-based leadership   31 \nwe would expect less interaction and communication between leaders and followers and thus \nfewer opportunities to develop agreement.  Similarly, individualism can be an obstacle to \nconsensus as followers are less inclined to search for cues about other colleagues\u2019 relationship \nwith their leader.   \nSummarising our considerations regarding LMX agreement and consensus, we have \nproposed that the optimal situation is where the leader and all followers agree on a high LMX \nrelationship, resulting in positive LMX agreement and consensus (Naidoo, et al., 2007).  So \nfar, we have looked into factors enhancing either agreement or consensus.  A question \nremains as to what are the conditions that leaders, followers, and organisations need to fulfil \nto achieve LMX excellence.  Our overview suggests that clarifying the role of followers is \nvital to LMX excellence, as is identifying followers\u2019 needs and how the leader can address \nthem. Climate is vital when it comes to creating an atmosphere that is conducive to LMX \nexcellence.  However, one constraint we have identified in terms of achieving LMX \nexcellence is culture.   It appears that in individualist cultures and cultures with a high power \ndistance, achieving LMX excellence is a particular challenge.  However, in our opinion there \nare still some recommendations to leaders in these situations on how to potentially achieve \nLMX excellence.  As we have indicated before, establishing and emphasising a group identity \nseems to support LMX excellence.  In an individualistic context, this may be even more \nbeneficial than in a collectivistic context as in the latter case, group identity may develop \nnaturally without the leader\u2019s intervention.  Thus, leaders of individualistic followers need to \nput extra emphasis on building followers\u2019 group identity. \nWhen it comes to power distance, we argued positive LMX agreement may be difficult \nto achieve due to infrequent communication and interaction patterns. However, high power \ndistance could be conducive to positive LMX consensus as followers might be more attuned \nand interested in creating a positive relationship with their leader. These contradicting \nRelationship-based leadership   32 \nassumptions mean that overall, the experienced power difference between leaders and \nmembers could prevent establishing LMX excellence as LMX excellence is defined as high \nlevel, high consensus, and high agreement. \nPower distance can be one aspect of leader distance. According to Antonakis and \nAtwater (2002), leader distance can comprise three aspects: (a) status and power distance, (b) \nphysical distance, and (c) infrequent contact with followers. It often refers to leaders on a \nhigher level of the organisational hierarchy rather than direct supervisors. Research on leader \ndistance can help understand the role of different dimensions of LMX in the agreement and \nconsensus debate.  Shamir (1995) argues that the perception of charisma is based on different \nfactors depending on the distance between leader and followers.  On the basis of this \nargument, Schyns et al. (2008) have reasoned that in case of leader distance, different \ndimensions of LMX (Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Liden & Maslyn, 1998) may be more or less \nrelevant for establishing LMX consensus. Specifically, Schyns et al. (2008) assume that \ncontribution and affect need more direct communication in order to be appreciated by both \nleader and member, whereas as loyalty and professional respect do not need to be confirmed \nto the respective other member of the dyad on a daily basis and can thus be upheld in contexts \nof high leaders distance. Thus, depending on leader distance, LMX excellence may be based \non different LMX dimensions. \nLimitations and Further Research \nWe have introduced the concepts of LMX excellence, consisting of high level LMX \nquality, high agreement, and high consensus.  Based on previous research we have argued that \nthis is the optimal constellation in achieving positive organisational outcomes associated with \nLMX excellence.  Nonetheless, these ideas await future empirical scrutiny.  While we have \nidentified several antecedents of LMX excellence, our list is by no means exhaustive.  Other \npossible factors and possible boundary conditions need to be identified in further research. \nRelationship-based leadership   33 \nFor example, we assume that LMX consensus is related to positive organisational outcomes. \nHowever, this might not to be the case under all conditions.  Recent research into LMX in \nsports teams has shown that when a differentiation a leader makes between followers is \nperceived as fair, variation will not negatively influence outcomes (van Breukelen & \nWesselius, 2007).  We can even assume that LMX differentiation that is perceived to be fair \nwill in the long run support a positive relationship quality with all followers, though maybe \nbased on different currencies of exchange (Uhl-Bien, 2006). \nAnother important limitation of our overview is that while we reviewed leader, follower \nand context factors, the follower characteristics we identified show the followers in a rather \npassive light: They either posses LMX-conducive characteristics or not.  However, followers \nare thought to generally play a more active role in the LMX leadership process than is granted \nto them in more traditional leadership approaches.  Thus, future research should investigate \nhow followers can actively influence LMX excellence (Uhl-Bien & Maslyn 2003).  This is \nespecially relevant as followers are thought to benefit in varied and significant ways from a \npositive relationship quality with the leader (Gerstner & Day, 1997).  \nIn closing, we note that our paper proposes further steps in identifying the means to \nachieve LMX excellence.  We call on LMX researchers and practitioners to join as in our \nquest for LMX excellence! \nRelationship-based leadership   34 \nReferences \nAntonakis, J., & Atwater, L. (2002).
