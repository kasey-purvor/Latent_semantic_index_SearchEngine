Much work focuses upon the symbolic construction of the past \nthrough heritage institutions, but in so doing it tends to underplay the affective experience \nof heritage sites. The paper argues that it is the felt experience and the organisation of \nsensibilities towards heritage which are often as important, and these have racialised \nmodalities. The paper thus looks at attempts to foster civic inclusion and argues that they \nneed to work through not just civic openness but felt exclusions and fears. The paper takes \ntwo canonical heritage sites to exemplify these issues. First, the British Museum was chosen \nas an urban national institution that is conventionally seen speaking in an unemotive, \npedagogical register. The history of the museum as collecting artefacts from around the \nworld and bringing them to London is related to diasporic communities\u2019 feelings about the \ncollections focusing on the Oceanic gallery. The second exemplar is the English Lake District, \nchosen as a rural national park that is seen to mobilise more visceral affective responses, is \ndeeply bound up with national sensibilities but has attracted attention for racial exclusivity. \n \nKey words: race, heritage, affect, Lake District, museums, landscape \n  \n \n2 \n \nIntroduction: \n\u2018I would like to speak on something that other people may not say. Many museums \nwere born out of the pain of conquest. I feel that there is a need for the museum \ncommunity to acknowledge that pain. Museums that present the culture of the \nworld need to acknowledge the story by which those collections were acquired. An \napology for this pain is necessary.\u2019 Professor Jack Lohman, Director, Museum of \nLondon Group, in GLA (2005, page 23) \nMuseum collections come from a wide range of sources, and can be used to offer a \nvariety of ways for people to connect with local and global concerns. They have the \npotential to mobilise a range of emotions and provide tolerant spaces in which \ndifficult issues can be addressed. Department for Culture,  Media and Sport (2005, \npage 14) \nThis paper examines the limits of a new orthodoxy in Britain of a \u2018heritage for all\u2019 that is \nframed by a process of civic inclusion (Moscati, 2007).  A series of important, effective and \nprogressive reports on national heritage have appeals to making \u2018tolerant spaces.\u2019 These \nrespond to critiques of the processes of civic governmentality in heritage sites but miss \nimportant aspects of fostering inclusion. Thus in 120 pages of cogent arguments for \n\u2018mainstreaming race\u2019 in London Museums, only 3 sides tangentially address the emotional \nresponses and affects of exhibitions. The quote above from Jack Lohman is all too true, \nother people did not raise that issue of emotional response to exhibitions. To rectify this, \nthe paper makes two moves. First, it highlights the need to consider affect, emotion and \nbodily relationships between audience and curatorial displays at national heritage sites. It \nargues that the production and circulation of feeling and sentiment, rather than civic \n3 \n \nknowledge, is crucial in excluding and including different people. National memory and \nnational heritage are embedded in the affective infrastructure that Thrift (2004) argues \ndrives, shapes, mobilises and motivates the national economies and body politic. Second, it \nlooks to the affective economies of nation experienced as an insider or stranger (Ahmed, \n2000) as expressed in encounters between citizen and landscape or heritage space. Heritage \nsites are interrogated as spaces where affective economies of citizenship both secure those \nsites as valuable, historical and singularly representative of national sensibilities, and as \nplaces which thus imbue those able to properly enjoy them with the virtues of citizenship.  \nFocusing upon the affective energy and emotive force of heritage entails a shift in analytic \napproach around issues of representation and feeling. Heritage studies have been very \nattentive to the discourses both around and also embedded in sites. They have deployed a \nvariety of semiotic and textual strategies to \u2018read\u2019 museums, and unpick heritage sites both \nas metaphoric texts and through their deployment of texts (Crang, 2003).  Looking to felt \nheritages requires us to understand belonging as emerging \u2018as much from visceral, affective \nand pre-discursive processes as it does from the materializing force of discursively \nembedded representations\u2019 and thus requires \u2018an ethos that apprehends the world less as a \nseries of sites from which to extract representational meaning, but as a field of processes \nand practices through which the ethical sensibilities of thinking may emerge\u2019 (McCormack \n2003, page 489). It is to take the social in motion rather than as a set of sedimented or \nnaturalised categories. We then interested in heritage sites as occasions for doing and \nfeeling, of connecting different sensations, representation and thoughts. We then follow the \nemerging work on geographies of affect that sees them as emotions in motion. We see \n4 \n \nheritage site as key enablers in the traffic between places, things, identities and belongings. \nAffect operates at more than the individual level and crossing different substances. \nHowever, heritage sites differentially enable and arrest the circulation of objects, people, \nemotions and ideas. They are at least in a significant part also intended more or less \nsuccessfully to fix, stabilise and store both things and categories. Museums work to \nsediment categories onto things, landscapes often naturalise social values. Work on affect in \ngeography has attended rather less to the fixities, intransigencies, to relations that are \nfetishised and reified, to performance as repetition (Pile 2010, page 10). Saldanha (2006) \nopens out some of this with his metaphor of viscosity for how racial types gradually become \n\u2018sticky\u2019 and cluster into racialised aggregates where localised \u2018thickenings\u2019 emerge from \nfluxes. Heritage sites allow us to look at such moments. Attending to the differential \ncirculations and thickenings acts as a check on analytic elisions of ontological monism, \nseeing everything as of the same substance, with an implied universalism of affect. Instead \nit highlights how feelings frame the gendered, raced and classed experience of places (Pile \n2010, page 7). It thus offers a caution that decentring the individual, human emotion in \nfavour of the transhumant, collective affect leads inevitably to questions of which human\u2019s \nfeelings are to be abandoned (Thien, 2005). The danger is that tacitly privileging one form of \naffective response as universal has been the hallmark of exclusive heritages. Instead the \npaper highlights the differentiated affective energies created by relationships between \ngeography (site, situation and spaces), places (how they are encountered, experienced and \nfelt), the body (race, citizenship, and positioning) and the \u2018heritage\u2019 apparatus (exhibits, \ntaxonomies, and conservation).  \n5 \n \nThis paper explores these differentiated relations through two contrasting iconic national \nheritage spaces that both promote rituals of citizenship, where civic practices display and \ninculcate belonging by orchestrating categories of \u2018native\u2019, \u2018nature\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 (Hall, 1997; \nYoung, 2008). The museum exemplifies a site where \u2018natives\u2019 are made as Others and \ndisplayed through the circulation and fixing of objects of knowledge in a cultural taxonomy. \nThe national park offers a landscape where \u2018natives\u2019 are made as selves, through the \npolicing and inclusion of specific objects and biota framed through an aesthetic taxonomy. \nThe choice of an urban and rural example highlights how location does, and does not, alter \nracial affects and resist locating those affects so easily in white rurality and cosmopolitan \nurbanism. In each the paper looks at how affective modalities and engagements can provide \nthe possibilities of a truly inclusive national heritage praxis.   \nThe paper starts with the example of the British Museum examining how old taxonomies \nhave given way to new civic inclusivity. It begins by reviewing the colonial and national \ntaxonomies that invest the British Museum with authority, as a space to inspire and to \ninstruct, for improvement of the mind (Nielsen, 2008), before introducing the powerful \ncritiques from the \u2018new\u2019 museology that have led to a new multi-cultural orthodoxy. This \northodoxy though, we suggest, still retains an exclusionary affective economy in how it \norganises bodies and objects. The paper then examines a recent exhibition that suggests \nhow to go farther to become non-ethnocentric and thus create a collective thickening of \nhistories through collaboration with communities represented. The second example is the \nLake District National Park which inspires different modalities of experience and \nsensibilities. We choose this rural example since \u2018the connections between the countryside, \nnation and racialization have had a particular longevity. It has been through pastoralism that \n6 \n \nquintessential versions of Englishness have been constructed\u2019 (Neal, 2002, page 444). The \naffective economy of the Romantic tradition is an accepted foundation for the national park \nwith Wordsworth\u2019s characterisation of this landscape as famously \u2018a sort of national \nproperty\u2019, in which \u2018 every man [sic] has a right and an interest who has an eye to perceive \nand a heart to enjoy\u2019 (quoted in Matless, 1998, page 251). However, the affective responses \nto this landscape have been argued to be racially coded where, as described in an oft cited \ncaption of Ingrid Pollard\u2019s 1984 Pastoral Interludes series: \u2018it's as if the black experience is \nonly lived within an urban environment. I thought I liked the LAKE DISTRICT, where I \nwandered lonely as a Black face in a sea of white. A visit to the countryside is always \naccompanied by a feeling of unease, dread\u2019 (emphasis in original, cited in Kinsman, 1995, \npage 301). The heritage presentation of these areas, and their population base, has made \nthem feel exclusionary to visible minorities (Askins, 2006). These issues have led to \ndeliberate attempts to be racially inclusive. Attempts that became embroiled in political \ndebates over claims that the Park\u2019s authority stopped various guided treks because they \nwere \u2018too white and middle class\u2019 (Tolia-Kelly 2007b, page 335). \nThe British Museum appeals to a putatively de-ethnicised sense of identity, and thence a \ncivic nationalism. Such an ethos sets this kind of institution in stark contrast to the affective \nregister of romantic ethnonationalist sentiment that mobilises an identification with place \nand soil. Very often critical accounts oppose affective, exclusive senses of belonging to civic, \ndemocratic, rationalist institutions. Where the former speaks all too problematically of \nblood and soil, the latter are strangely bloodless.  The paper shows how they both still owe \ndebts to colonial taxonomies that organise bodies, things and visiting practices through \nnotions of native and  non-native, in different yet consistent ways. Recent attempts to make \n7 \n \nthe institutions inclusive, such as in debates on cultural property, still work with a putatively \nuniversalist framework \u2013 where the assumed universal values are freighted with western \nassumptions (O\u2019Neill 2004). The sites claim a universal affective response where difference \nis erased. A 19th century account of \u2018race,\u2019 fixing the taxonomies of \u2018man,\u2019 still permeates \nthe civic spaces of national museums and parks, and subtends supposed audience \nsensibilities.  This paper argues that in as much as understanding the racialisation of \nheritage requires an understanding of its affective registers, then understandings of affects \nrequire an understanding of their racialised production. \nEmotion and affect have always been foundational to fear, belonging, terror and moral \ngeographies underlying citizenship. Affect drives the encounter between national \ngeopolities (Thrift, 2004; Ahmed, 2004). As Ahmed (2004) has shown, national identity \npivots around a sensibility that enfranchises some but also divides along raced lines. \nHowever, within the literature on this affective identification (Davidson et al. 2005; Thrift, \n2004; Thien,2004) there has been a limited account of the ways that national heritage \nindustries are implicated in affective economies of love and hate which shape international \nrelations,  civic identity and national pride (Sylvester, 2009). This paper considers how \ncultural cohesion, national culture and a national history are intertwined in the spaces of \nthe British Museum and the Lake District National Park. This intervention reviews the call for \ninclusive civic management and museological praxis (Bennett, 2004) and the continued \ndebates on race and heritage (Littler and Naidoo, 2005; Hall, 1997; Hall, 2000) and their \npolitical frictions (Karp et.al  2006; Voogt, 2008). \n \nSiting heritages: Britishness, Englishness, urbanity and rurality \n8 \n \n \nAny account of heritage and national identity in Britain faces the problematic of the \nmalleable usage of national categories such as \u2018Englishness\u2019 and \u2018Britishness.\u2019 The historic \nunion of England, Scotland and Wales has also always been inflected by a South centred \nnational imaginary (Daniels, 1993). The relationship of Scottishness to Britishness, \ndecolonization, devolution and the production of new internationalized national image are a \ndifferent set of alignments again (McCrone et al., 1995) that are beyond the scope of this \npaper. The changing alignments of Britain and England can be registered in Hogan\u2019s (2009) \nsurvey of public discourses of national identity in Britain, she finds a frequent conflation \nbetween Britishness and Englishness by mass populations though after political devolution \nin 1997, was a slight increase in sentiment towards Englishness in England. The elisions \nbetween English and British are maintained throughout our cultural realms and have been \nwritten through and critiqued by many others and do not need to be retheorised here (see \nMatless, 1998; Hall, 1990; Gilroy, 1993; Colley, 1992). The production of Britishness, and the \ndiminution of England, has been argued to happen through the process of imperial \nexpansion (Schwartz, 1996). Imperial contraction might be supposed to invert that. For \nexample, the founders of the National Trust located England\u2019s future in the ability to \npreserve its past, retreating in to a concern for preserving the domestic beauty of England \nand in \u2018so doing, the Trust contributed to the dislocation of England from the imperial \nproject of the British Empire, securing the image of idealised, rural Englishness within the \nnational geographic imagi(nation)\u2019 (King, 2007, page 187). At the British Museum, \nBritishness becomes sublated into the Great Chain of Being where the march of Civilisation \ntakes us ineluctably towards the pinnacle represented in the contemporary nation (Mack, \n9 \n \n2003, page 17). Partly it was through the production of an \u2018Anglo-Saxon\u2019 race by the \ndevelopment of typologies shackling together objects, developmental stages and peoples. In \nthis way, stories of the \u2018British race\u2019 could be produced, articulating ethnological \nmeasurement of peoples and artefacts with a teleological racial story both in museum \nexhibits and via ethnological maps of rural folk (Young, 2008). National heritage sites \nthemselves, thus play an active role in the constant, if constantly evolving, set of elisions \nbetween versions of nation, and its definition.  Indeed the elastic imaginative spaces in \nwhich the sites are located is part of their power.   \nBoth the British Museum and the English Lake District operate within a national institutional \nfield of practices that collate an understanding of \u2018national\u2019 and \u2018citizenship\u2019. That is they \nhave a national curatorial voice framed within a professional field that legitimates and \nsupports their operation. They are also geographically positioned in relation to the national \npolity. The British museum was situated in British Imperial territory spanning several \ncontinents brought together in the consciously imperial display triangle, anchored on \nWhitehall and Kensington with Trafalgar square. It was at the heart of the imperial capital \nwhere promotional campaigns in the early twentieth century advertised the ability to take \nthe Underground to see all of the empire \u2013 botanical specimens at Kew, colonial embassies \naround the Strand, through to the Victoria and Albert museum with the reconstructed \nGwalior Gate from India framing its oriental exhibitions entrance and the Imperial Institute \noffering \u2018all the empire under one roof\u2019 in South Kensington (Driver and Gilbert, 1998; \nGilbert and Driver, 2000; Swallow, 1998). The English National parks such as the Lake \nDistrict, by contrast, have been framed as inner places where the \u2018connection between the \nrural as the \u2018genuine\u2019 England and [constitutively+ not multicultural \u2019 can appear \u2018to exclude \n10 \n \nethnic minorities, among other groups, from accessing the countryside, both physically and \nemotionally\u2019 (Askins, 2009, page 365). Neal and Agyeman (2006, page 9) argue that \nwhiteness and senses of nation are conflated through a sense of feeling in the countryside \nwhere \u2018ethnicity opens up the gaze to majoritized ethnic formations, particularly \nEnglishness.\u2019 The two examples contrast a Britishness in the world with an internalised \nEnglishness.  \nSylvester (2009) notes that the imperial underpinnings of the British Museum\u2019s geographical \nclaims persist to this day but with different resonances: \nThe British museum is always artfully somewhere else, too [...] It is both National \nand International [...] the British Museum says to the spectators: Great Britain is \nstill great, despite stinging controversies about imperial exploits of the past and \ndiminished power in its present incarnation. The British Museum says something to \nInternational Relations too: there is no clash of civilizations; there is only \ninternational culture, which we can best caretake (page 53). \n\u2018Race\u2019 becomes part of a disembodied liberal ideology within the heritage realm which \nattempts to convince us \u2018that the liberal state has sloughed off its ethnic-particularistic skin \nand emerged culturally cleansed, universalistic, civic form\u2019 (Hall, 2000, page 228). \u2018Race\u2019 \nwithin this ideology, if mentioned at all, blends into a time-line of knowledge where a linear \nmap delineates racism as \u2018in the past\u2019 (Naidoo 2005, page 39). Its director describes the \nBritish Museum as a \u2018universal institution\u2019 whose displays enable visitors \u2018to see the world \nas one\u2019 and hence promote a more tolerant society (O\u2019Neill 2004, page 190). This new \northodoxy offers a cosmopolitanism for a putative citizen of the world, that feeds upon the \ncurrent rescripting of the city, especially London, as multiculturally open in ways the \n11 \n \ncountryside is apparently not. Instead this paper argues that race is still important to the \nmoral geographies of nation and national heritage; through differential bodily affects \nanimating performances of citizenship.  \n \nCivilising affects (pt 1): producing native Others and knowing subjects \n \nThe first configuration of affects and spaces we use is the British Museum: an institution \nthat claims to speak without emotion, but instead through the dispassionate voice of an \neducative scholarship. It does so through a technology using a specific epistemic sensibility. \nMuseums act as tools of governance \u2018connecting specific forms of expertise to programmes \nof social management, operat[ing] in registers that are simultaneously epistemological and \ncivic\u2019 (Bennett 2005, page 522).  \nThe civic museum categorised and ordered the world, articulating \u2018a coherent cultural \nresponse to the fragmenting and challenging conditions of modernity by arranging objects \nso that they tell coherent stories about time and space\u2019 (Hetherington 2006, page 602). This \nmuseum took the disembodied gaze of visual knowledge and transformed it into physical \nform, where rooms and buildings spatialised categories and set material objects out as \nvisual proof of the logic behind the museum (Hooper-Greenhill 1992). The museum \nenvisioned the world and our place within it by fixing imported and domestic artefacts; thus \nnationalising others\u2019 natures, cultures and artefacts too. It produced a purified domus and \nforeign through regimes of truth that reworked the aesthetics, grammars, and meanings of \n12 \n \nartefacts textures, histories through systems of classification and categorisation. It pacified \nand ordered the global movements of people and cultures that \nthrow objects, identities and ideas into flux. [Migration] has been a defining factor \nof modernity yet remains hazily understood as a significant factor in the 20th -\ncentury artistic formations [...] but what often arises is a largely de-historicised \noutlook (Mercer 2008, page 7) \nThe museum thus brought together objects from around the world to represent cultures \nand thus used processes of delegation, in a Latourian sense (Bennett 2002, page 31), \nwhereby these new centres of representation made the distant in space and time speak of \n\u2018Other\u2019 natives to a civic public.  \nThe museum was a technology where the \u2018democratic\u2019 use of objects, assembled into \ncategories of knowledge, was intended to inculcate civic virtues via civic rituals (Bennett, \n2004) though these were freighted with class based assumptions (Hill 2005). Visiting \ngalleries and museums became both an expression of civic belonging and a means of \ninculcating it. The ornamental exterior of museums, proclaimed their mission as secular \ntemples to learning and the celebration of national virtues. Over the nineteenth century the \nhegemony of the neo-classical style set the museum up as a shrine to the secular values of \nstate and nation. Its pretensions to universal knowledge were symbolised by the move to \n\u2018universal\u2019 classical forms, and away from competing \u2018national\u2019 built forms, such as mock \nGothic. The museum did not merely resemble a shrine, but worked like a temple for the \nperformance of a secular ritual of citizenship (Duncan, 1991). The British Museum main \nsouth entrance enacts this with a neo-classical frontage whose pediment interprets \u2018The \n13 \n \n*universal+ Progress of Civilisation\u2019, followed by the memorials to staff who gave their lives \nin two world wars (Mack 2003, page 14). \nThe British Museum\u2019s universal voice to an assumedly undifferentiated audience is now \neven more problematic: \nThe emblems of Empire do, of course, fitfully appear in the Heritage. However, in \ngeneral, \u2018Empire\u2019 is subject to widespread selective amnesia and disavowal. And \nwhen it does appear, it is largely narrated from the viewpoint of the colonizers. Its \nmaster narrative is sustained in the scenes, images and the artefacts which testify \nto Britain\u2019s success in imposing its will, culture and institutions, and inscribing its \ncivilizing mission across the world\u2019 (Hall 1999, page 7). \nIn a postcolonial context James Clifford (1997, page 212) has called on museums to become \nmore of \u2018a borderland between different worlds, histories and cosmologies\u2019 than the site of \nauthoritative curation with universalized meanings and audiences. Bennett notes that \nentails new \u2018forms of cultural objecthood\u2019 being developed to \u2018to refashion museums so \nthat they might function as instruments for the promotion of cultural diversity\u2019 (2005, page \n521). \nHowever, despite having embraced a critical review of the narration of an Imperially defined \ncategorization of culture, cultural objecthood remains embedded within a formal \nuniversalism where the British Museum defines the parameters of inquiry, interpretation \nand conservation. So the first shift amounts to \u2018other\u2019 histories appearing in a deracinated, \nconsumer cosmopolitanism. Thus the British Museum has recently tended to engage with \noverseas heritages through \u2018block buster\u2019 exhibitions such as Shah Abbas: the making of Iran \n14 \n \n(2009); Hadrian: Life, Love, Legacy (2008); The First Emperor: China\u2019s Terracota Army (2007); \nAfrica at the British Museum (2005 ) Views from Africa (2005-6), and Africa Now (2006).  \nBeyond these exhibitions, a shift in curatorial \u2018voice\u2019 has been occurring since the \nmillennium. Increased utilisation of exchanges with other galleries, and new media, have \nmade the institutional frame porous. Its curatorial practice has become more mobile and \nthus the geography of its knowledge production has extended.1 If the centrality of Western \nvoices is being displaced then there is the opportunity to allow new registers of meaning \nand identification \u2013 as in the recent Africa exhibition the second segment of the exhibition is \nentitled Views from Africa that included views from Black British residents with ancestral \nconnections with nations in Africa. These were though professional voices including those of \nStuart Hall, and African curators in Southern and Western Africa. This shift in intellectual \nvoice enacts the cultural geographies of new museological practices, but also the new \ngeographies of Africa and Britain being forged through the collaborations with visitors, \nacademic professionals and anthropologists.  \nSuch a shift struggles against the history of the exhibition of artefacts from other cultures \nfocusing on the visual impact of the exotic rather than their cultural context. The success of \nthese displays depended on the museums\u2019 practice of \u2018visual commodification, dominated \nby purveyors of spectacle and entertainment\u2019 (Bohrer 1994, page 212).  Arguably the \ndominant blockbuster exhibitions perpetuate rather than challenge this tradition. This \naestheticisation risks the self-alienation of viewers whose culture is thus spectacularised , \nthe exhibits are meant to be seen \u2018back here\u2019 by \u2018us\u2019 about \u2018them\u2019 \u2018over there\u2019 \u2013 yet now \n\u2018they\u2019 are \u2018here\u2019 (Lionnet, 2004). The perpetuation of these distancing colonial optics, and \nthe failure to open a dialogic space, led to exhibitions such as \u2018Into the Heart of Africa\u2019 in the \n15 \n \nRoyal Ontario Museum, being besieged by angered publics (Schildkrout, 2004). In New \nZealand this sense of national race tension in the heritage industry has been addressed \nthrough developing a bicultural heritage or, at least, a \u2018strategic biculturalism\u2019 in sites such \nas the Te Papa Tongarewa museum in Wellington, which attempted \u2018to collapse hierarchical \nboundaries traditionally organising museum collections ... and to construct a heterotopia\u2019 \n(Dyson 2005, page 129). However the result has been to indigenise \u2018whiteness\u2019 and \nhomogenise \u2018Maori\u2019 as neoprimitive, reduced to an almost timeless disembodied singularity, \neffectively muting and making palatable the subaltern. Truly co-constituted material \nhistories for the British Museum, need to acknowledge the sharing of resources and \nknowledges from elsewhere, imported into Europe. Otherwise the sensibilities from whence \nthese international artefacts are collected are lost; the artefacts are deadened, and their \nevocative power for awe and wonderment (and their own biographical lives) are delimited \nby the complex of display and the grammar of the legacy of an Imperial cultural lens. A \nrecent exhibition of Oceanic heritages offers an example of what co-constituted histories \nmight look like. \n \nThe body in the British Museum\/ The body is the museum \n \nThe dry, educative register of the British Museum belies the violence of colonial taxonomies \nof race and culture (Bhattacharrya, 1998; Young, 2008; Anderson 2007). The curatorship of \ncultural artefacts was predominantly driven by an understanding of \u2018other\u2019 cultures as \nbounded, different to European and based on \u2018other\u2019 philosophical and emotional palates. \n16 \n \nIn essence, art and culture from racialised nations were rendered as primitive , based on \nfeelings and not intellect, savagery not civilisation, and thus not situated within modernity \nitself (Gilroy, 1993; Cubitt et al, 2002; Mercer; 2008). In 1953, Fagg , a benevolent keeper of \nartefacts in the British Museum\u2019s Department of Ethnography,  thus noted that  \nThe artist may be using his creative genius to give expression to a philosophy \ncommon to his people, which he unreservedly and perhaps unconsciously accepts \n*\u2026+ but when, in a sufficiently receptive form of mind we are confronted by the art \nof some exotic people, we can hardly fail to recognize the presence of an alien \nhabit of thought (pages 7-8) \nFor many indigenous artists, the representation of Oceanic culture has been a violence of \nmisrepresentation and mistruths, perpetuated by the grammars and curatorship of art and \nculture in museums the world over. For contemporary Maori artists classic exhibits are not \nfactual and emotionless but alienating, traumatic and indeed inspire affective responses \nthat remember the violences of colonial intervention in \u2018Oceania\u2019. The museum becomes a \ndisorienting place. These are the affective economies of heritage sites: the inspiration of \nemotional response that is collectively experienced, which in turn has a political force.  \nThe drive towards making the displays and the structure and content of narratives within \nthe museum space relevant to all (Alizar, 2009) has seen new attempts to connect to \ncommunities as participants. In this vein, 2009 was a significant year with the re-launch of \nthe British Museum\u2019s Oceanic and Polynesian galleries on the ground floor with the sculptor \nGeorge Nuku becoming Polynesian artist in residence. The galley\u2019s re-launch is part of the \nBritish Museum\u2019s project of incorporating the contemporary modes of heritage \nrepresentation and re-making of this Imperial space of instruction. The Maori artist George \n17 \n \nNuku was selected as artist in residence to modernise, enliven and bring a future vision to \nthe collection of oceanic art due to his fabrication of traditional forms utilising new \nmaterials such as Perspex and polystyrene to stress that innovation and transcultural flows \nare part of Polynesian tradition. The galleries were realigned with a 21st century narration \nof crystallising a \u2018structure of feeling\u2019 that reflected contemporary Maori senses and \nsensibilities about their heritage, in their terms. The re-launch ceremony was significant in \nthat the gallery space became Maori -- it became a place of rightful belonging of both \nobjects and peoples. It proffered a state of citizenship to all of those attending, a truly civic \nstatus to museum and community. The power dynamic between Imperial archive and \ncolonised also shifted; it was the Maori community, represented by artists such as Rosanna \nRaymond, that invited the British Museum directors into the newly organised cabinets, \nwhere they were welcomed as if they were entering as Maori, into a marae. Significant \nrituals, songs, chants and dress were reproduced to make a re-embodied \u2018home\u2019 for the \nBritish \u2018national\u2019 collection of Aotearoan and Polynesian artefacts assembled in the museum \nsince Cook\u2019s voyages in the Pacific 1768-80 (Starzekca, 1996). These artefacts included \nsacred objects and fine art which were given in goodwill to Captain Cook as an act of \nexchange. However when interviewed Raymond was clear she felt nothing was then \nreciprocated. Raymond described the re-launch as a moment in recovering a prospect of \nreciprocation at least of respect and goodwill. By bringing in the \u2018voices of the marae\u2019, the \nBritish Museum is finally made \u2018home\u2019 to the artefacts ripped from their hearth. This re-\nlaunch physically shifted the museum space to incorporate an embodied and performative \nceremony, which proffered it as a civic hearth, a \u2018home\u2019 state led by the London residents of \nMaori, Polynesian and other oceanic communities. The aim for the British Museum was to \ncounter the myths and violations of prior narrations and to enfranchise Maori visitors, and \n18 \n \nreposition objects in museum cabinets and archives to be for a community and not of a \nprimitive race. They challenged the \u2018dubious intellectual procedures (that) underlay the \nhistory of the interpretation of the Pacific cultural origins\u2019 based on \u2018a complex of \nassumptions, deeply entrenched in European thought made it possible to attribute \nsophisticated technical skills to people who in other contexts were regarded as close to \nNature ... or, in the second half of the nineteenth century, as of low social evolutionary \nstatus\u2019 (Durrans 1979, page 153). These fixings and distancings were finally acknowledged \nand re-written through a new mode of empathy and possibilities for a collaborative \nauthorship .  \nA part of this new enfranchising moment was to shift the framings of artworks and \nartefacts. Thus, newly commissioned artworks by Rosanna Raymond and George Nuku use \nfibres, old and new, acrylic and jade; feather and plastics. The inclusion of new materials is \nintended to enrich the cabinets with contemporary grammars and aesthetics that speak to \nnew generations and which physically and affectively disturb older curatorial accounts that \nsituate Maori as primitive, and these objects as ethnographic rather than as an alternative \nart history. Raymond, in her 2009 ethknowcentrix exhibition at the October gallery reverses \nthe classic sense of museums organising bodies within their galleries, to suggest instead \u2018the \nmuseum is in the body.\u2019 For the artists involved, the exhibition turns on its head the notion \nof displaying bodies of \u2018others\u2019 as passive texts and artefacts from which we can know \n\u2018other worlds, peoples and places.\u2019 Instead intelligibility is reliant on the audience\u2019s \nopenness towards an emotional and embodied encounter that orientates towards \nexperience rather than making objects and text legible. The usual heritage encounter is \ncounteracted in this event. It reveals the British Museum\u2019s usual problematic assertion of \n19 \n \n\u2018the superiority of a universal cultural value over the living religious meanings of sacred \nobjects\u2019 (McNeill 2004, page 194). The authorship here is held by the \u2018other\u2019 and the \naudience connect to them through the vernacular media of dance, art and voice, enacting \ncontemporary versions of the spiritual stories which challenge orientalist accounts of \nmythologies, with postcolonial reconstructions of the power of kinship and ecologies of \nliving and leaving a heritage of the earth.  \nThe objects attain their life meaning or Va (Raymond, 03.12.09, interview), they awake from \ntheir deadened state and become alive through a national sensibility and awaken diasporic \nidentification. Raymond explains that using the body is essential in a new inclusive \nmuseology, as the bodies of the diasporic are the museum space itself. The body \nknowledges harbour a newly translatable record, bringing to life archive and artefact \nthrough which \u201cthe world can write the new histories that it needs to understand its past \nand shape its future\u201d (accessed 19.11.09 \nHttp:\/\/www.thebritishmuseum.org\/the_museum.aspx ).  \nWhat is required as a catalyst between museum and visitors, individuals and the logics of \nexhibition is an empathy between them. The affective charge of empathy, bonds \nintellectually, spiritually and presents an opportunity for using the affective capacities of \nindividual and collective bodies to counteract the tendency to assuming universal responses \n(Tolia-Kelly, 2006). A similar move can be seen where Jensen, the senior curator at the \nNational Museum of Australia, Canberra, attempts to address how situating visitors\u2019 own \nbodies and time-lines can serve to overcome discordances projected in prior curatorial \npractice. Her exhibition:  Eternity: Stories from the emotional heart of Australia is one of five \npermanent exhibitions launched at the museum\u2019s opening in March 2001. The themes of \n20 \n \nthe exhibition are: Mystery, Loneliness, Passion, Fear, Separation, Devotion, Chance, Thrill, \nHope and Joy.  The themes allow individuals to tell their story, illuminated through access to \nicons, objects and directly linked to Australian history. In Eternity, the metanarration of \nhistory is not the overarching aim of the curator, but a grounded notion of a \u2018people\u2019s\u2019 \nhistory, as woven into the artefactual collections is. \u201cThe stories leapt out of the cases\u201d \n(Jensen, 2007 page 13). The bodies, emotions and affective registers of the people of \nAustralia made the museum. \n \nCivilising affects (pt2): producing native selves, constituting unfeeling Others \n \nOur argument is that there are different affective registers between national park and \nnational museum, but that the epistemic regimes of materiality and belonging are linked. \nBoth are designed and organised as embodying \u2018national\u2019 spaces for the welfare, education \nand enjoyment of the citizens. However, instead of producing a mode of civic engagement \nby reaching out around the world, the national park is based on preserving, actually \nfostering, a sense of a \u2018native\u2019 landscape and thus in a \u2018nationalising of nature\u2019, and a \nreciprocal naturalising of the nation (Jazeel, 2005; Kaufmann, 1998). National parks tend to \nbe represented as \u2018home' landscapes or \u2018national' natures and associated with the political \nidea of a bond between people, land, and nation (Mels, 2002, page 137; Crang 1999). In \nBritish heritage the collapsing of \u2018native\u2019, \u2018national\u2019 and the sensibilities that are aligned with \nthe process of being a citizen, \u2018whiten\u2019 both the sensibilities and histories of British culture \n(Dyer, 1997; see also Darby, 2000). Often those \u2018non-native\u2019 cultures, bodies and \n21 \n \nsensibilities that are occluded are those of \u2018darker\u2019 territories and continents, \u2018non-civilised\u2019 \nand \u2018non-nativised\u2019 cultural migrants and diasporas. In civic terms, these are British \nnationals, present as a result of the circulation of Britain\u2019s expansive colonising regimes and \nyet they are deemed out of place in the ethno-nationalist sensibility of the Lake District. \nThere particular ethnicities and sensibilities are negated in a process embedded with an \nimperative to treat \u2018national\u2019 culture as \u2018native\u2019. The landscape is emptied or naturalised \nleaving a sense of an ahistorical, \u2018pure' ecosystem where there is a simple bond between \npeople, land, and nation. In the case of national parks, a scientific sense of the biological \nnatality of flora and fauna that redoubles the integrity of a natural, material landscape. \nThe National Park is connected to the typological imaginary of race in the museological \nepisteme. The taxonomic divisions are in this case embedded in the world:  \nDuring colonialism it was English rurality that represented what was particularly \ncivilized and culturally superior about Britain. In a postcolonial era the importance \nof English rurality has developed around the politics of (invisible) whiteness and \nconstructions of ethnicity, identity and belonging (Neal, 2002, page 444) \nMuseological productions of Anglo-Saxon racial stories were matched in the nineteenth \ncentury by cartographies such as Beddoe\u2019s (1971\/1885) Races of Britain. This produced \nmaps of peoples created through typologies based on specific chosen physiognomic \nfeatures. Beddoe\u2019s could thus produce and map an \u2018Index of Negresence\u2019, where colour is \npejoratively coded, founded on a quasi-algebraic formula combining like head shape, eye \ncolour, hair colour and so forth (Winlow, 2001, page 521). Even though these maps claimed \nto describe, they projected a moral geography (Winlow 2006). The facticity of maps lent \ncredence to the frankly speculative natures of the identities charted, but a close \n22 \n \nexamination reveals two trends. First, with the least influence from racial mixing, the heart \nof the English Lake District was in his index a hearth of British whiteness and cultural purity. \nSecond, for all his scrupulous cataloguing of difference, it was clear that mixture and \nmigration were the foundation of English identity (Young 2008, pages 131-133).  \nDespite the maps\u2019 attempts at producing clear divisions of peoples and types, they reveal \nsuch divides to be cartographic artefacts: \nSaxon supremacism was therefore finally successfully challenged through invoking \ncontemporary racial science. *\u2026+ As racial science became more sophisticated, and \nas ethnologists began to test out their thesis that the English were racially axons, \nthe more it became apparent that not just historically, cultural and linguistically, \nbut also racially, the English were irretrievably mixed (Young, 2008, pages 124-5). \nParallel to this racial mapping was a cultural cartography of the Lakes as a fixed, bounded, \nnatural landscape \u2013 occsionally recognised as stewarded by a (fixed, bounded) local \ncommunity. This is reiterated in the anxiety to maintain \u2018native\u2019 landscapes in Britain. Yet as \nSmout (2003, page 19) argues, the claim or quest for a native ecology is \u2018feeble in scientific \nterms\u2019, being rather more animated by \u2018emotive issues\u2019 than accurate ecology or history so \nthat the archival \u2018preservation of our priceless heritage\u2019 and perhaps a variety of \u2018ethnic \ncleansing\u2019 are \u2018seldom far from the surface.\u2019 This can lead to \u2018cultural and natural \ncategorisations that are disingenuous to British landscape history\u2019 and tantamount \n\u2018ecological racism\u2019 (Tolia-Kelly, 2008, page 290). \nIn this heritage landscape great energies are invested in keeping out \u2018alien species\u2019, such as \nin the concerted efforts and scientific imperatives for \u2018bio-integrity\u2019 reiterated in the \n23 \n \nBassenthwaite Still Waters Partnership whose aim is to control invasive alien species in that \ncatchment area. And yet a scrupulous ecology of the Lake District reveals it has long been a \nsite of \u2018non-native\u2019 fish and flora, at least since the 10th century, possibly the Roman rule of \nBritain, which makes a dualistic approach (of native and foreign) na\u00efve and culturally \ndisingenuous. The Herdwick sheep roam the hills as a result of introduction by the Vikings. \nWithout sheep, the landscape would return to its natural state of woodland, meaning \n\u2018foreign\u2019 animals underlie the aesthetics of preservation. Nordic place names such as \u2018beck\u2019 \n(stream), \u2018dale\u2019 (valley), \u2018tarn\u2019 (lake), \u2018thwaite\u2019 (clearing) also mark this landscape with \nScandinavian practices and cultures of nature, and were made visible in the Beddoes \ntypologies of British peoples. Skiddaw itself is composed of Ordovician slates, which were \nlaid down as sediments some 500 million years ago in a sea that we now call the Iapetus \nOcean, one-third of the way south of the equator towards the south pole -- only crossing \nthe equator comparatively recently in their history (Massey, 2006, pages 34-5).   \nIn the narrations of this heritage site the fluidity and cosmopolitan roots of the cultural \nhistory of what makes up the natures, landscape and material cultures of the Lake District \nare not emphasised. As Ingrid Pollard suggested \u2018you do not have to look very far beneath \nthe surface of rural landscapes to find new narratives of the past. The exhuming of these \nghosts and the places they inhabit is a kind of \u201ccultural archaeology\u201d\u2019 (cited in Bressey, \n2009, page 387). As an example, on the nearby coast lies \u2018Sambo\u2019s Grave.\u2019 A solitary grave \nof an unknown black servant, who died in the 1730s and was commemorated in 1796 from \nsubscriptions raised by summer visitors (Kean, 2008, page 57), it is approached down a mile \nof track from a turning at Overton starting from what was called the \u2018cotton tree\u2019, most \nlikely a kapok tree from the West Indies, that finally blew down in 1998. All too often an \n24 \n \nEnglishness that is actually made up of translocal and transcultural, cultures, natures and \npeoples, came to function instead \u2018as a coded term for whiteness, for the invisible norm \nagainst all other ethnicities were measured and defined\u2019 (Young 2008, page 239). Ignoring \nthe depth of that plural history, can itself be used as a rationale for not addressing issues of \nrace in the countryside. \nThe reading of the landscape culture of the Lake District as a closed localised entity \nsubtends its representation as a singular sensibility available to and properly appreciated by \nan English citizenry. However, this does not reflect truly the translocal values and affective \nexperiences of mobile folk. The popular landscape aesthetic of the Lakes proffers a timeless \nexperience of nature, textures of landscape and cultures an Englishness defined through a \npackaged 19th Century Romanticism. William Wordsworth\u2019s descriptions of particular sites \nand routes are routinely harnessed within the Lake District tourist economy to secure a \nnotion of this landscape as embodying a picturesque culture of enjoyment and appreciation \n(Squire, 1988). However, Wordsworth\u2019s poetry reflected his visceral response of terror and \nawe to the sublime beyond the well documented \u2018nostalgia for a rural economy, and a \nsimple life among pastoral mountains\u2019 (King, 1966, page 171). Wordsworth\u2019s focus on \nnature is often cited as a retreat from the world of politics into being a \u2018nature poet\u2019. \nHowever his nature was the last site of resource for a denuded humanist citizenry offering a \nrevolutionary ecology. His aims of preservation were not simply aimed at conserving a local \nCumbrian pastoralism but to open the ecological enfranchisement of the Lake District. The \nyounger Wordsworth\u2019s politics are critical in unsettling the \u2018national\u2018 nature of the \nsensibilities harboured and mobilised through the heritage economies of today. Indeed we \ncan consider his poetics of nature and his landscape sensibilities as themselves translocal. \n25 \n \nWordsworth\u2019s emotional relationship with the Lake District harboured radical sensibilities \nloaded with empathy for the colonised overseas. \n \nAffective Ecologies and TransCultural Taxonomies \n \nFor, certainly the younger, Wordsworth, England was a primarily a political force, and not a \nbenign native territory. He penned a sonnet entitled \"To Toussaint Louverture,\" published in \nThe Morning Post in February 1803, in which he deplored the reestablishment of the Code \nNoir in the French colonies. England\u2019s body politic was equally a source of Imperial \noppression. Wordsworth\u2019s social sensibilities are framed within the notion of \u2018a singular \nhuman heart\u2019 (Wordsworth, 2004, page 58). It encompassed an international notion of this \nlandscape as a site of nurture, and refuge. The lakes by default were a site of nurture of an \ninternational sensibility, sensitive to others\u2019 suffering, dehumanisation and objectification. \nDe Quincey (1921, page 43) in particular argues that Wordsworthian humanism embodied a \nrefuge from an economy of Imperialism. Wordsworth\u2019s canonisation as a \u2018nature poet\u2019 \ncelebrated for an envisioned, bounded \u2018localness\u2019 misses how his loves of nature and \nlandscape are in fact elements of a broader and globally located sensibility. The landscape of \nGrasmere, the locale at the heart of Wordsworth\u2019s emotional life, is a means to find \nemotional nourishment away from the degradations of capitalist life (Bate 1991, page 26).  \nA sensibility built on Wordsworthian awe provides a sensory palette that both links to and \nchallenges colonial taxonomies. The ability to feel for the countryside is often at the heart of \ndefinitions of cultural appreciation and thence identity. Therefore our affective response \n26 \n \nand questions of the \u2018nature\u2019 of our identity are interlinked. What emerged, historically, was \na notion of a \u2018centre\u2019 of civilized culture, that can feel and appreciate properly. The ability to \nfeel for beauty was denied to \u2018others.\u2019 Aesthetic values, sensibilities and cultural heritage \nare intertwined in the foundational value system of cultural definitions. In the context of the \nLake District these have long been connected with: \n\u2018Fears of imperial decline, racial degeneration and class warfare laid the foundation \nstones for a variety of bodies in these years- from Baden Powell\u2019s Boy Scouts to \nCecil Sharp\u2019s Folk Dance Society- all anxious to counter the unhealthy physical and \nmental conditions of urban life by bringing its \u2018victims\u2019 into contact with the natural \nworld\u2019  (Trentmann, 1994, page 585) \nThe countryside was seen as redeeming (white) urbanites by exposing them to authentic \nEnglishness, through teaching them the sensibilities to experience the landscape. By the \n1930s about 100,000 English men and women were regularly hiking across the countryside \nand camping out in the popular brand of \u201cMaori Tents\u201d.  \nHoney-coated re-inventions and marketing of Windermere offer the affective pleasures of \nserenity, tranquility and the pastoral. Wordsworth\u2019s original experience of terror is not \nevidenced in the proffered encounters with heritage space. However this closes down the \nsensibilities brought to the lakes where transcultural experiences mean fear is re-\nencountered, and the landscape resonates strongly with awe in contemporary visitor \nexperiences (Tolia-Kelly, 2007b; Kinsman 1995). As Askins (2009) argues there are twin traps \nof simply universalising a rural appeal invariant to all or simply \u2018othering\u2019 people as repelled, \nor unable to access the affective appeal of the landscape due to \u2018having different \u201cnature \nmyths\u201d and a different appreciation of nature, because they are of different ethnic \n27 \n \nbackground\u2019 (page 368). Instead she notes the complex set of affective registers of \nresponse. For sure there is anxiety (partly driven by being very visible as different visitors, \nbut also by gendered concerns that cut across racial lines) but there are also other emotions \nand feelings (both positive ones, such as feeling liberated, and negative ones, such as, \nboredom) that are cross-cut by gender, age and class. The \u2018native\u2019 and \u2018outsider\u2019 distinction, \nis complicated by felt resonances in site where parallels are drawn to distant places whose \npresence they invoked. Askins\u2019 respondents\u2019 affective responses made explicit connections \nof upland national parks with the foothills of the Himalayas\/the Blue Mountains in Jamaica, \nwhile villages were associated with remote ancestral homes, and thus \u2018rurality is implicated \nin and implicates other spaces and places\u2019 (2009, pages 371, 373). Equally though the \naffective connection to the sites may differ, as when Tolia-Kelly (2007, pages 343, 346-7) \nfound immigrant women expressing fear of the Lake District as physically mountainous and \nrefusing to walk up to the high Kirkstone Pass even though they \u2018had lived in the Himalayan \nfoothills, *where+ their \u201chigh places\u201d were one hundred fold higher and steeper.\u2019 Here they \nthen refused the affective appeals of walking as bodily practice or of the mastering of peaks \n(Lorimer and Lund 2003). Others found joy and exhilaration in the hills freeing them of \nconfined domestic situations. These heterogeneous affective economies recombine bodies, \nnations, and territory.  \n \nConclusion \nThe affective economies of race emerge in heritage encounters, that is race is produced \nthrough movements between sites, bodies and feelings. This paper has shown that \n\u2018affective economies need to be seen as social and material, as well as psychic. The \n28 \n \naccumulation of affective value shapes the surfaces of bodies and worlds\u2019 (Ahmed 2004, \npage 121). Affective engagements with cultures of landscape need to account for \ndifferentiation through material practices and presences of beholding and that beheld \n(Tolia-Kelly 2006). The emotions evoked are not universal or individual, but need to be \nhistoricized as emerging from conjunctures of power, identity and mobility. This \ndifferentiation of affective registers and responses highlights that there are no affective \nuniversals or automatic responses. The notion that one affective response is universally \nproduced has indeed enabled places like the Lake District to hide the ethnic coding of that \nparticular experience. That then is a danger in attending to the affective force of sites and \nlandscapes without situating and historicizing their felt response.  Equally, seeing heritage \nsites as producing affective economies provides a positive way to get beyond the dismissal \nof feelings of exclusion or repulsion as individual foibles or mere emotion compared to \nrational responses. Encounters with landscape mobilize hosts of energetic transfers. \nThe question becomes what affects does heritage incite for a new age? We might then \ncharacterize a struggle between a populism (that risks being a free-for-all commodifying \ncultures as sources of pleasure), or a community based approach where different \ninterpretative audiences are sought (that risks essentialising communities or assuming some \nliberal commonality of reciprocal communication) and a refashioned modernism (that holds \non to the ideal of universal meaning with the risks of missing different sensibilities) (Dibley, \n2005). This paper suggests that what is required to enable an ethical orientation in \u2018civic\u2019 \nheritage landscapes are frameworks of thinking which promote open, transcultural \nresponses to art and culture (Tolia-Kelly, 2007a). Transcultural, emotional identifications \nwith citizenship are embedded in cultural praxis and influenced by connections with \n29 \n \nlandscapes across the imperium (in its temporal and spatial contours). Emotional values and \nattachments result from networked mobilities that contribute to an English\/British \nsensibility. This approach explores Britishness and heritage values from a perspective of \ntranscultural affective influences to recover them from than imperial categorisations. Thus \nwe can see the transcultural affects circulated and produced by the felt difference from the \nEnglish lakes but also their felt familiarity with Asian mountains, or the affects enabled by \ninvoking the original romantic politics, or the reanimation of traditional objects brought \nfrom Polynesia and previously sequestered, now revivified through new forms with new \nmaterials to render traditions usually depicted as static and \u2018over there\u2019 as alive and \u2018over \nhere.\u2019 \nNational heritage institutions in Britain today are clearly becoming more sensitized to issues \nof inclusion. However the framing of this as creating neutral taxonomies or spaces of \ntolerance focuses upon universalist modes of knowledge apprehended through cognitive \nprocesses.  Given emotional responses, and emotive appeals, lie at the heart of the power \nof heritage then institutions need to engage on the terrain of how they orchestrate affective \nenergies. Their solicitation and production have just as deep colonial and racial legacies as \nthe collections of artefacts in the museums. However, engaging with the affectual \neconomies of responses to heritage also offers the possibility to find new modes of \nsolidarity, not in putatively universal feelings or masterful visual displays of diversity, but in \nempathy through heterogeneous felt responses. \n \n \n30 \n \nReferences \n \nAhmed, S. 2000: Strange Encounters: Embodied Others in Post-Coloniality.
