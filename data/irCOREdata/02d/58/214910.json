The \nreasons are twofold.  First, there has been a major focus on employment and in \nparticular gender equality: in order to remove disincentives for female labour market \nparticipation, the Barcelona European Council in 2002 (CEU, 2002) called for \nMember States to provide childcare to at least 90% of children between 3 years old \nand the mandatory school age by 2010 and to at least 33% of children under 3.  \nSecond, it has increasingly been recognised that universal access to \u2018high quality pre-\nprimary education\u2019 can be particularly important for reducing inequalities including, \nfor example, those associated with parents\u2019 educational background and socio-\neconomic status (CEC, 2008, p. 140).   \n \nRecent education policy in England has tended to bring together \u2018educational\u2019 and \n\u2018childcare\u2019 functions in the location of services, the mechanisms for maintaining or \nenhancing quality of provision and also in the language of policy.  Thus, the extended \nschools initiative has increased the availability of supervised activities for children \nbefore and after school and thus incorporated a \u2018childcare\u2019 function within schools. \nHowever, nowhere is the elision more important than in provision for the \u2018early \nyears\u2019.  Indeed, the Early Years Foundation Stage, sometimes described as a national \ncurriculum for under-fives, aims to apply a single set of standards, regardless of the \nchildcare setting (with the exception of the family home) \u2018ending the distinction \nbetween care and learning in the existing frameworks [for early years providers] and \nproviding the basis for the inspection and regulation regime\u2019 (DCSF, 2008a, p. 7). \nLeaving aside the controversy surrounding the appropriateness of those standards, in \n 2 \nunderstanding early years education and care it is crucial to note that, despite the \ndevelopment of a new policy language relating to \u2018early years provision\u2019, some \nservices and service providers, such a childminders or day nurseries, approach the \nnew policy environment from a care trajectory while others, such as nursery and \nprimary schools, come from an educational trajectory. \n \nNotwithstanding the importance of this distinction, the National Childcare Strategy \n(DfEE, 1998) acknowledged that the UK \u2018lagged behind in developing good quality, \naffordable and accessible childcare\u2019 (DfEE, 1998, pp. 5-6).  A key focus of the \nstrategy was on improving education provision (Lewis, 2003).  In 2004, the 10-Year \nChildcare Strategy set out the Labour government\u2019s vision (HM Treasury, 2004).  In \n2009, Next Steps for Early Learning and Childcare (HM Government, 2009a) re-\nemphasised the importance of quality: \u2018While the provision of early learning and \nchildcare is paramount, the quality is equally important\u2019 (p. 6).  Major policy changes \nand increased investment in early years education in England have taken place since \n1998.  However, this paper argues that these changes may not be sufficient to meet \nEU objectives in terms of quality or the government\u2019s policy goals of high quality, \naffordable and accessible early years education and care.  There are major issues that \nappear to militate against achieving these goals; these relate to the levels of \ngovernment funding and to the regulatory context.  There are also divergences \nbetween the providers in terms of their own objectives and underlying values which \nmean that both quality may be variable and access to certain types of providers \nrestricted.   \n \nThe argument will be informed by answers to a series of linked questions: \n \ni. How does the UK compare with other EU countries in terms of pre-primary \nparticipation and expenditure?  \nii. How has participation and expenditure in England changed over time?  \niii. How does resource allocation vary between providers of different types? \niv. How do providers in the public, private and voluntary sectors resource early \nyears education and care? \n \n 3 \nThe first section addresses question (i) and the second addresses questions (ii) and \n(iii).  The third section addresses question (iv), focusing on the financing of early \nyears providers of different types, drawing on in depth interviews carried out with key \ninformants representing providers of different types, operating nationally or in \nselected local authorities (LAs); we explore funding streams, expenditure and fee \ncharging policies.  The final section draws on the findings and argues that current \npolicy and practice may not achieve either overall EU objectives or the government\u2019s \npolicy goals.  Moreover, a number of tensions exist, relating to funding, regulation, \nstaffing and ethos. \n1 European context \nEarly years education is provided in different ways across Europe.  National statistics \nfor under-3s are not available across all countries, nor are they standardised as in \ninternational databases (Eurydice, 2009).\n1\n  However, data are available for children \naged three and over.  Table 1 provides data on participation rates in pre-primary and \nprimary education across the EU-15.\n2\n   \n \nTable 1 about here \n \nThere is marked variation between countries.\n3\n  In the UK, 80% of three year olds are \nin education at the pre-primary (and primary) levels (International Standard \nClassification of Education (ISCED) levels 0 and1).  Thus of the EU-15 countries, for \nchildren aged three, the UK is in eighth position in the \u2018league table\u2019 in terms of \nparticipation, with France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Germany and Sweden all \nhaving higher levels of participation. \n \nIn terms of public expenditure on pre-primary education, the UK is near the bottom of \nthe \u2018league table\u2019 as shown in Table 2.  Some of the variation is because compulsory \neducation begins at different ages: 4 in Northern Ireland and 5 in Great Britain and the \nNetherlands, 7 in Finland and Sweden and at 6 in the remaining 11 countries (NFER, \n2009).  Notable amongst those that spend a high proportion on under fives education \nare Denmark and France, both of which also have high levels of expenditure, and to \nwhich we return. \nTable 2 about here \n 4 \n2 Policy, participation and expenditure in England  \nPolicy \nPre-school education policy in the UK has had a high political profile since the \nConservative government introduced a nursery voucher scheme in 1996-97 in four \nlocal authorities (LAs) in England.  It was extended to all LAs in 1997-98.  Parents of \neligible children were invited to apply for vouchers, which were used to \u2018purchase\u2019 a \nfree part-time pre-school education place for their child in a school, nursery school, \nindependent school, private provider or voluntary provider (Sparkes and West, 1998). \n \nThe Labour Government, elected in 1997, ended the voucher scheme and from April \n1998, all 4-year-olds instead became entitled to a free part-time nursery education \nplace for the three terms prior to compulsory education (the term after they reach 5 \nyears of age); from April 2004, this was extended to all 3 year olds (DCSF, 2004).  \nThe entitlement originally comprised 12.5 hours of free early education per week for \n33 weeks a year; this was increased to 38 weeks in 2006 (DCSF, 2009a).  From \nSeptember 2010 the entitlement will be extended to 15 hours (House of Commons \n(HC), 2009b) and will be able to be used more flexibly, over at least three days a \nweek.  From September 2009, all LAs were required to make this extended offer \navailable to 25% of their most disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds (DCSF, 2009b).   \n \nIn 2007, an extension of free early education was offered to disadvantaged 2-year-\nolds in just under half of LAs and was extended across England in September 2009.  \nThe focus is on delivering provision to \u2018the most disadvantaged two-year-olds in each \nLA across the country\u2019 (DCSF, 2009c, p. 3).  From 2011, all children will be entitled \nto start school in the September after their fourth birthday, or be able to take up 25 \nhours of free educational provision per week (HM Government, 2009b). \n \nFunding for free early education is provided by central government.  Since 2006-07 \nthe funding has been via a grant to LAs (the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG)), which \nin turn distribute funds to providers (West, 2009).  Nursery education providers for \nchildren under statutory school age\n4\n are varied and comprise bodies in the public, \nprivate and voluntary (non-profit) sectors.  As we have noted early years education is \ninter-related with day care: in particular, learning and development requirements are \n 5 \nan integral part of the Childcare Act 2006.  Providers include nursery schools, nursery \nclasses and infant classes (part of primary schools),\n5\n where provision is restricted to \nterm-time only (and therefore provision most closely matches the entitlement \ndescribed above).  Although a full school day is offered in primary schools and some \nnursery schools, this is not generally the case with nursery classes or pre-school \ngroups (or playgroups) where a morning or afternoon session is the norm.  Full day \ncare all the year round is offered in day nurseries, which are run by providers in the \npublic, private and voluntary sectors.  While such providers may historically have \nbeen viewed as providers of childcare, they are also able to provide free early years \neducation places.  In addition, accredited childminders who are part of networks \napproved to deliver early education may also provide early years education \n(Directgov, 2009a).  Providers in different sectors (particularly public, private and \nvoluntary) may also be part of children\u2019s centres6 (see Speight et al., 2009); children\u2019s \ncentres located in the 30% most disadvantaged areas should have as part of their core \noffer the provision of all day, all year integrated early education and day care (HC, \n2006).\n7\n   \n \nThe funding mechanism is, in essence, a quasi-voucher with a set value (determined \nat a local level) being paid to registered pre-school education providers in the private, \nvoluntary and independent sectors for every eligible 3- and 4-year-old in attendance.  \nFor schools, funding is via local funding formulae set by LAs; funds are distributed \nby a formula which is based primarily on the number of children on the school roll, \nbut also takes account of the age of children and other factors including deprivation \n(West, 2009).  However, from 2010 LAs must operate a single funding formula for \nboth maintained schools on the one hand and private, voluntary and independent \nproviders on the other.  It is important to note however that this does not imply that \ndifferent providers will be funded at the same rate and that, even under the new \narrangement, there is a \u2018minimum funding guarantee\u2019 which ensures that all schools \nreceive a specified minimum level of increase in their level of funding per pupil each \nyear (Noden and West, 2008). \n \nPolicy changes have resulted from the Childcare Act 2006.  Each LA has a legal \nobligation to \u2018secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the provision of \nchildcare (whether or not by them) is sufficient to meet the requirements of parents in \n 6 \ntheir area\u2019 so that they can take up or remain in work or undertake education or \ntraining which could assist with this (section 6(1)).  It must also \u2018must prepare \nassessments of sufficiency of childcare\u2019 (section 11(1)).  Amongst the factors that \nshould be taken into account is that childcare places are affordable (DCSF, 2007, para \n2.15): indeed affordability may influence whether or not provision is \u2018sufficient\u2019 (para \n5.18).  Places must also be sustainable and \u2018sufficiently inclusive and meet particular \nneeds\u2019 (DCSF, 2007, para 2.15).   \n \nAs was noted earlier, the government has also imposed a regulatory structure with a \nview to improving the overall quality of early years provision, the Early Years \nFoundation Stage (EYFS).  This is applicable to all providers and is underpinned by \nthe Childcare Act 2006 and accompanying regulations.\n8\n  Providers have a legal duty \nto ensure that their early years provision complies with specified requirements and are \nalso obliged to have regard to statutory guidance (DCSF, 2008a).  The learning and \ndevelopment requirements relate to six areas: personal, social and emotional \ndevelopment; communication, language and literacy; problem solving, reasoning and \nnumeracy; knowledge and understanding of the world; physical development; and \ncreative development.  Associated with each area are learning goals; throughout the \nfinal year of the EYFS each child must be assessed by a practitioner, who must use 13 \nassessment scales and \u2018have regard\u2019 to the nine-point scale set out in guidance (DSCF, \n2008a).\n9\n  Staffing ratios and qualifications have also been clarified with regulations \nwhich vary for different types of setting\/provider as shown in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3 about here \n \nA new category of staff has been introduced, called the Early Years Professional \n(EYP).  This is open to graduates and requires the completion of an early years \ntraining programme (CWDC, 2009).  The government is aiming for all children\u2019s \ncentres offering early years provision to employ an EYP by 2010 (HC, 2009a) and has \nset a target for there to be one in one in every full day care setting by 2015 (HC, \n2008b).  \n \nThere is also government financial support to parents for early years education and \ncare.  The Working Tax Credit (WTC), available for parents on low incomes working \n 7 \nat least 16 hours a week, includes a childcare element which meets 80% of childcare \ncosts with a registered or approved childcare provider.\n10\n  Students in higher education \nwith dependent children may also be eligible for a means tested grant which covers up \nto 85% of childcare costs.\n11\n  Free child care is also available for families where one \nparent is in work and another wishes to train in order to return to work; and childcare \nsupport is also available to single parents training for work (see Directgov, 2009b).  \nDirect support is also available via employers who may provide childcare vouchers, \nwhich, up to a certain value (\u00a355 a week in 2008) are exempt from tax and national \ninsurance contributions (HMRC, 2008).\n12\n \n \nWhile these three mechanisms - free nursery education via a quasi-voucher, the \nchildcare element of WTC and employers childcare vouchers - all provide valuable \nassistance to parents, the onus is on parents to decide which will confer the greatest \nbenefit.  However this requires a level of knowledge that is doubtless beyond that of \nmost parents.\n13\n \nParticipation  \nParticipation rates in early years education in England are very high for three and four \nyear olds as shown in Table 4.\n14\n \n \nTable 4 about here \n \nAmongst three year olds there has been an increase (from 44% to 58%) in the \npercentage of those taking up early education places, all in the private and voluntary \nsectors.  The percentage taking up free early education has increased markedly (from \n6% to 56%) as a result of early education being available from the age of 3 from \n2002, indicating a willingness of parents\/carers to take up the offer.  Amongst four \nyear olds, overall participation has remained more or less constant, but there has been \nan increase in the take up of free education places in private and voluntary providers \nand in infant (reception) classes and a concomitant decrease in nursery schools and \nclasses.   \n 8 \nExpenditure  \nAlong with these policy changes, expenditure on under fives has increased sharply \nsince 1997 as shown in Table 5. \n \nTable 5 about here \n \nProviders receive their funding for early years education via the government\u2019s \nDedicated Schools Grant.  Although this grant as a whole is hypothecated, the early \nyears element is not ring-fenced for spending on early years education.   \n \nTable 6 about here \n \nAs shown in Table 6, there are differences in expenditure per pupil across different \ntypes of setting and between providers.  Whilst the amount delegated for a child in a \nnursery schools was an average of \u00a33,801, for a nursery class it was \u00a31,798 and for a \nprovider in the private, voluntary or independent setting \u00a31,832.  Nursery schools are \nknown to be costly, although they also provide high quality provision (Sylva et al., \n2004).   \n \nPlanned expenditure in nursery classes and private, voluntary and independent (PVI) \nproviders is not dissimilar although the average amounts conceal wide variation \nbetween LAs as indicated by the minimum and maximum planned spend, and in most \nLAs the reported rate of funding per hour was higher for maintained nursery classes in \nprimary schools than for PVI settings.  In addition the income of maintained schools \nmay be supplemented by resources from a range of other central government \ninitiatives (such as the Standards Fund and capital grants). In other respects \nimplementation can be very different from one locality to another with some LAs \nbasing funding of PVI providers on attendance and some on a headcount.  In the \nfollowing section, we explore the funding of providers of different types at the local \nlevel. \n \n \n 9 \n3 Funding early years provision: providers\u2019 perspectives \n \nIn depth interviews focusing on funding issues were carried out with key informants \nrepresenting six different types of providers (see Table 7).  In the maintained sector, \nthe headteacher of a nursery school (which was also the lead setting of a children\u2019s \ncentre), and the finance officer of an infant school with a nursery class were \ninterviewed.  In the private sector, the managing director of a large national chain of \nday nurseries and the owner of a small private nursery school chain were interviewed.  \nIn the voluntary \/ nonprofit sector, a contracts manager from a social enterprise that \noperated in several LAs and the local finance officer of a voluntary organisation that \noperated nationally were interviewed.  Interviews lasted between one and two hours \nand were transcribed.  This paper focuses on two key themes.  First, it explores \nfunding streams, the adequacy of resources provided by the government for early \nyears education, any subsidisation from other funding streams and expenditure and \nstaffing.  Second, it examines fee levels. \n \nTable 7 about here \nFunding and expenditure \nIn the following sections we focus on funding streams and expenditure reported by \nthe different types of provider.  Figure 1 presents the funding sources. \n \nFigure 1 about here \nNursery school \/ children\u2019s centre \nThe local authority allocates funds for the nursery school provision and via a separate \nfunding stream for day care for children in need (from 18 months of age).  The main \nincome streams comprise the DSG (43%) and social services (30%) along with \nseveral other smaller funding streams from the local authority, including DCSF and \nlocal authority grants related to particular initiatives (19%) and other small streams \n(e.g., special educational needs statement funds, philanthropy, rental income).  Once \nmonies reach the school, the various funding streams are merged into one pot and \nspent as needed.  The centre is expected to provide certain services in addition to early \neducation and day care, including outreach, a drop-in and a toy library.  Significant \n 10 \nparts of the centre\u2019s income were uncertain.  Although there were several funding \nstreams for different initiatives from different parts of the council, including education \ninitiatives, the interviewee commented: \u2018the school budget is the only one I can rely \non\u2019. \n \nThe nursery education entitlement was seen to be adequately funded by the DSG, but \nthere was evidence of there being a cross-subsidy, with funds from elsewhere being \nused to enable extra provision for those who were not entitled but felt to be in need.   \n \nIn terms of expenditure, 81% of funds are spent on staffing, 4% on curriculum and \n4% on utilities (figures exclude spending on capital improvements).  All staff are at \nleast at NVQ level 2.  There is a mix in terms of staff, with teachers for nursery \neducation sessions, and other staff with NVQ level 3 qualifications.  The school is \nsubject to different regulatory requirements for nursery education and day care \nsessions respectively. \nNursery class \nNursery classes are integral parts of primary schools.  For the primary school with a \nnursery class, around 75% of the funding was from the DSG and around 17% from \nDCSF initiatives\/funds.  The remainder came from a range of other sources, the \nlargest being lettings.  All revenue resources were reported to be merged in one pot by \nthe school: there is no separate budget for the nursery.  There is also a separate capital \nfunding stream.  Staffing in all year groups is driven by the School Development Plan, \nwhich requires a teacher plus assistant structure in every class, including the nursery. \n \nThere were two sources of financial uncertainty.  The first is a fall in the school roll: \nthe school is oversubscribed in the nursery and reception years, but is suffering from \nloss of older children (and hence funding) due to high mobility in the area.  The \nsecond source of concern is the limited reach of the government\u2019s guaranteed \u2018uplift\u2019 \n(the minimum funding guarantee).  The government has guaranteed a 3-year 5% \nuplift, but this only applies to the DSG, not the other funding streams (e.g., \ngovernment initiatives and capital grants), which are essential to the budget.   \n \n 11 \nIn terms of revenue expenditure by the school, 77% is spent on staffing. The \nremainder is spent on a range of different items including learning resources, \nadministration, maintenance of premises, utilities and rates.  The school pays no rent \nand capital funding is via a separate stream.  The staffing ratio is higher than required \nat 1:10.  In each of the nursery classes there is one qualified teacher and one member \nof staff with an NVQ level 3 qualification.   \nLarge private nursery chain  \nThe main funding source is from parents\u2019 fees.  The organisation also received funds \nfrom the government\u2019s Transformation Fund (now the Graduate Leader Fund) which \nis designed to raise the quality of the early years workforce. \n \nThere seemed to be lack of clarity with regard to the NEG\u2019s sufficiency.  On the one \nhand, it \u2018supplements our overall occupancy quite nicely\u2019; \u2018it is important to us\u2019.   On \nthe other hand, the NEG is less than the normal fees charged: \u2018the way that the NEG is \ndistributed and divided means that we actually end up subsidising the government\u2019s \n\u2026 free entitlement\u2019. However, there had been \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 insofar as \nthe free funding had encouraged parents to try out nursery provision for free and then \npurchase more hours at full cost. \n  \nIn most nurseries the NEG income was reported to cover the nurseries\u2019 costs.  In some \nparts of London, because operating costs (including staff costs) are much higher, there \nwas reported to be a financial loss.  The government\u2019s desire for increased flexibility \nin the provision of the NEG was felt to create challenges as the nursery could \u2018end up \nproviding childcare to people with the NEG maybe in five hour blocks over three days \nand that\u2019s their full childcare required\u2019.  This could be a \u2018threat\u2019 to the provider as \nthe normal fees are higher than those from the NEG.  Interestingly, some nurseries run \nspecific NEG sessions; they have \u2018separate rooms where they just take children in the \nmorning for two and a half hours and in the afternoon for two and a half hours in \nterm time\u2019. \n \nIn principle, all the nurseries in the chain offer the free NEG places without any \nrequirement that it should be combined with further paid-for provision.  However \naccess to the free entitlement alone seems restricted and contingent on availability.  \n 12 \nWhen a nursery opens there is likely to be space, but once it starts to fill up it is in the \ninterest of the provider for children to attend on a weekly basis as opposed to a \u2018a \ncouple days here or a morning here or an afternoon there\u2019.  Thus, flexibility \ndiminishes as the nursery fills up.  Nevertheless, flexible solutions are sometimes \nfound, such as combinations of NEG and other take-up so that in effect parents are \nsharing a full-time place.  Thus, parents seeking stand-alone NEG places are \nencouraged to use less busy days of the week.  The interviewee implied there was \nlittle demand for the free sessions alone: \u2018the sort of parents we\u2019re attracting\u2026very \nfew people come just for the two and a half hour sessions\u2019.   \n \nIn relation to risk and uncertainty, the interviewee felt that there was \u2018a fair degree of \ncertainty\u2019 although particular challenges could arise as a result of the economic \nsituation, which might reduce demand for childcare.  Government policy was not felt \nto be driving the increased use of childcare \u2013 this was felt to be demand led.   \n \nIn terms of expenditure, staffing outside the chain\u2019s head office accounts for 57% of \nturnover, overheads (rates, utilities, refurbishment etc.) count for 11%, and \nconsumables (food, toys) for 4%.  It is estimated that property costs are 9%.  \nOperating profit is around 10% (after the deduction of debt interest repayments on the \nchain\u2019s properties).   \n \nIn terms of staffing, the interviewee reported that the nurseries aimed to exceed \nregulatory requirements to demonstrate the quality of the product.  Staff employed are \nat NVQ3 level for managers and nursery nurses and NVQ2 for nursery assistants.  \nNursery assistants without qualifications, but in the process of training for NVQ2, \nmay also be used. \nSmall private nursery school chain \nThis is a small nursery school chain operating in two LAs.  Three funding streams \nwere identified. Fees accounted for about 80% of income;  NEG accounted for 10%; \nother income included the government\u2019s Transformation Fund and funds for special \neducational needs for children particularly with higher level needs and deemed to \nneed \u2018action plus\u2019 or with \u2018statements\u2019. \n \n 13 \nGovernment funding through the NEG was seen to be totally insufficient: \u2018it\u2019s really \nnothing near it\u2019.  The variation in the amount allocated by different LAs was also \nnoted, with one providing considerably more than the other.  Cheques for the NEG \namount are returned on termly basis to the fee-payer for the amount of nursery grant.  \nThis includes cheques to multinational corporations if these pay childcare fees for \nemployees.  Although claiming the NEG is seen to be somewhat burdensome, the \ninterviewees reported that they would not opt-out themselves, \u2018unless we\u2019re told we \nhave to provide it free at the point of entry\u2019.  There was criticism of the concept of \nflexibility in relation to the NEG \u2013 the idea that parents can chose when to take the \nfree provision.  This is seen as highly impractical. \n \nOverall income levels were felt to be sufficient (this is unrelated to the NEG which is \nrefunded to the fee-payer) and the interviewees were \u2018very confident\u2019 regarding \nsurvival.  One problem in relation to sustainability was mentioned and this was related \nto the landlord of one nursery.   \n \nIn terms of expenditure, approximately 65% is on staffing. Equipment and capital \nrefurbishment was 10%, rent 10% and the surplus was between 10% and 15% - some \nof this goes towards capital refurbishment and future investment in the business.  The \nowners take remuneration for their own work out of surplus rather than through \nsalary. \n \nThe staffing ratio was more favourable than required by statute, the prime motive is \ngood practice and achieving higher quality: \u2018I don\u2019t think you can give them the kind \nof attention they need, the individual attention\u2026if you have too big a group of \nchildren\u2019 and \u2018we try and do things to such a high standard\u2026\u2019. Similarly qualification \nlevels exceeded statutory expectations.  All nurseries were already led by graduates, \nand the organisation was increasingly looking to employ graduates at lower levels.  \n \n \n \nVoluntary provider 1 \nVoluntary provider 1 is part of a large voluntary organisation.  Funding streams for \nthis organisation in 2008-09 included parent fees (49%), local authority contract \n 14 \nincome and other government grants (40%) and other income such as charitable \ngiving (8%). NEG funds amount to only 3% of organisational income. Contract \nfunding is seen to provide medium term stability.  There is a children-in-need block \ncontract which is particularly important although contract variations have caused \ndifficulties as the LA has reduced the number of required places.  From these funds \nthe organisation provides additional services, including training for the childcare \nworkforce.     \n \nThe NEG was reported to be refunded to parents through discounted fees.  The \nnursery grant was reported to come \u2018nowhere close to paying how much money it \nactually takes to keep that child in the setting\u2026\u2019.  In common with the large private \nchain, the hours funded by the NEG were also seen to be insufficient, so that it was \nvery difficult to provide the free entitlement on its own: \u2018it\u2019s incredibly rare that we \ncan...for that short period of time in the day\u2019.  For a nursery to be sustainable, it must \nreach a certain level of occupancy, but if places are filled piecemeal, then this \nundermines occupancy.  Thus, if a parent only uses the nursery in school term time, \nthe place will be unfilled in the holidays.  Again, if a parent takes 2.5 hours per day, \nthis may potentially knock out a full-time place. \u2018No one wants a two week place.  No \none wants a six week place for a six week holiday, then you\u2019ve lost your income for \nthat period of time as well\u2019.   \n \nThe organisation rarely takes on parents simply for the 12.5 hours per week in term \ntime.  In other words, it may (effectively) withdraw from the scheme if parents only \nwant to use the scheme and no further childcare.   Again, the central issue is nursery \nand organisational sustainability.   \n \nExpenditure on staffing in 2007-08 was approximately 71%, property costs were 15% \nand  consumables 9%; the remainder was for items such as recruitment and audit.  In \nterms of staffing, statutory ratios were adhered to. Qualifications varied.  Nursery \nmanagers required an NVQ3, although some had significantly higher qualifications. \nSome nursery assistants had no childcare qualifications, but were participating in the \norganisation\u2019s training programme.   \n 15 \nVoluntary provider 2  \nThe nursery has three prominent income streams: a large contract with the local \nauthority, the NEG and parental fees.  The Transformation Fund is also important.  \nThe nursery is part of a larger local organisation which receives approximately 41% \nof its income from the LA contract, 26% from the NEG, 21% from parental fee \nincome and 9% from the Transformation Fund (the remainder comes from other \nsources including donations).  Thus, 76% of the funding comes from government \nsources. \n \nThe NEG was not felt to be sufficient and without the local authority contract for the \nprovision of childcare the organisation \u2018would close. It would absolutely fall apart\u2019.  \nThe NEG hours are offered free to parents.  This provision is subsidised by the local \nauthority contract: in effect, the local authority is subsidising the inadequacy of its \nown NEG payments. \n \nIn terms of expenditure, across the local organisation to which the pre-school belongs, \n75% is spent on staffing, 11% on property costs (rent, maintenance, utilities, \ncleaning), 4% on administration, 3% on resources (e.g., supplies, equipment), the \nremainder on other items (3%) and a small surplus (3%).  The staffing ratio is in line \nwith regulations but volunteer parents are used as part of the ratio if a staff member is \nout of the pre-school.  The pre-school is led by a supervisor with a level 3 \nqualification.   \n \nFees  \n \nNo fees are charged for nursery classes in schools in the maintained sector, or for the \nstandard nursery school provision.  Fees are charged by all other providers as shown \nin Table 8.  The hourly rates of voluntary provider 2 and of the assisted scheme of \nvoluntary provider 1 are similar to the local authority\u2019s NEG rate; other hourly rates \nof PVI providers are substantially in excess of this.  Similarly with these two \nexceptions weekly rates are in excess of the maximum allowable costs against which \nfinancial help may be claimed through the childcare element of the Working Tax \nCredit. \n 16 \nTable 8 about here \n \nNursery school \/ children\u2019s centre \nIt was reported that on occasion extra provision is offered, and although technically \nparents should pay, in practice they are only very occasionally charged, and even then \nat a token level.  There were two specific areas in which children were targeted to \nreceive more provision than that to which they were entitled.  First, early years \neducation for non-social services children was provided in term time only.  However, \nsome parents were encouraged to bring children in during the holidays, at no charge.  \n\u2018This is their childcare if you like because we\u2019re not in term.  So there\u2019s no school \nmeals, no free school meals\u2019.  Second, social services day care places were part-time.  \nSome children were effectively given full-time provision with decisions about which \nchildren or families to target for extra provision being made informally according to \nperceived need.  Some children were specially targeted \u2013 those \u2018we know could \nbenefit\u2026as would their parents\u2019 mental health\u2019.  Attending during the school holidays \nwas felt to be \u2018incredibly beneficial\u2019 as there are fewer children at the nursery. \nLarge private nursery chain \nFees were reported to be decided for each individual nursery on an annual basis.  The \nprocess has some complexity and relates to competitors\u2019 fees, Ofsted standards, \noccupancy, provision and wage costs.  The decision is based on \u2018quality of the \nprovision\u2019.  The interviewee commented that the nurseries tended to be purpose-built \n\u2018and we would put a premium on a purpose-built nursery\u2026so it is about putting a fair \nprice for the facilities and services you\u2019re offering\u2019.  However, it was also noted that \n\u2018if you\u2019re in a situation where there are two or three other purpose-built nurseries \naround you, then\u2026you\u2026have to look at price and not be a million miles away \notherwise, you could simply price yourself out\u2019.   Ultimately it is a delicate balance \nbetween ensuring sufficient take-up (through competitive fees) while keeping fees \nhigh enough to create a profit.   \nSmall private nursery school chain \nFees were reported to be based on similar provision in the local market; comparative \nprices are independent schools and nurseries and Montessori nursery schools or the \n 17 \nequivalent in the local area.  There were no explicit or formal discounts for more \ndisadvantaged families.  Nonetheless the owner operates an ad hoc, informal system if \na parent is perceived to face difficult circumstances, with fees being either reduced or \nbeing paid in instalments.  However, any fee reductions effectively come out of \nsurplus, and so cannot be frequent: \u2018I don\u2019t do it too much cause we couldn\u2019t actually \nsurvive if I did\u2019. \nVoluntary provider 1  \nFees were reported to be determined on the basis of an annual assessment which looks \nat inter alia \u2013 inflation; amount needed to keep nurseries open; contracting income; \noccupancy levels; and realistic fee level.  In general there is a 2-tier system of \n\u2018standard\u2019 and \u2018assisted\u2019 fees.  There is a formal assessment of parents to determine \nwhat fees they should pay, with an apparent emphasis on equity of process.  Needs \nassessments look beyond simply household income and could include single parent \nfamilies and people in part-time or low paid work or at college, and additional needs \nof the child or family. \nVoluntary provider 2 \nFees were set to correspond to the NEG rate \u2013 \u2018If government can say it costs that, it \nshould cost that and I thought, right, we should charge that.\u2019 Such fees were \nrelatively low and felt by the key informant to be at a level \u2018which makes it accessible \nfor ordinary people\u2019.  Provision was seen to be \u2018affordable childcare for those who \nneed it\u2019. \n4 Challenges to universal, high quality, affordable provision \n \nIn the UK, there is a relatively low level of participation of three year olds in early \nyears education compared with other EU-15 countries and expenditure is also \nrelatively low.\n15\n  At this point, it is worth contrasting provision in two countries with \nhigh levels of participation and expenditure: Denmark and France.  In Denmark, pre-\nprimary education is publicly funded; institutions are typically open 10 hours a day, \nall year round.  We might notionally see this as a childcare model.  A monthly fee is \npaid which is means tested (Eurydice, 2008a; Cirius, 2009).  In France, pre-primary \neducation is provided in publicly-funded \u00e9coles maternelles which are open during \n 18 \nthe academic year, 26 hours a week, up to six hours a day; no fees are levied \n(Eurydice, 2008b).  We might see this as a full-time nursery school model.   \n \nBy way of contrast, in the UK publicly-funded free early years education is for fewer \nhours, not all the year round and not necessarily available as a \u2018stand alone\u2019 \nentitlement.  Participation is dependent on the supply of places: indeed, 39% of \nparents of pre-school age children thought that there were \u2018not enough\u2019 formal \nchildcare places in their local area.  Moreover, 42% of parents of pre-school children  \nin England described affordability as \u2018fairly\u2019 or \u2018very poor\u2019 (Speight et al., 2009) \n(although free early years education is available it may not be available without other \nprovision being purchased).  \n \nAs a result of policy changes \u2013 and particularly the entitlement to free early years \neducation for three and four year olds \u2013 expenditure in England has increased \nmarkedly.  Participation has also increased, particularly amongst private and \nvoluntary providers and infant classes, but with a reduction amongst nursery schools \nand classes.  This raises some important issues as research evidence suggests that \nquality is higher in nursery schools, integrated education and care centres and nursery \nclasses than amongst other providers (Sylva et al., 2004; see also Lewis, 2003; Penn, \n2000, West, 2006).   \n \nResource allocation between providers of different types varies: allocations to nursery \nschools are very much higher than those allocated to other providers.  However, the \noverall allocation to PVI providers is not dissimilar to that for infant schools with \nnursery classes.  Nonetheless, quality has been found to be higher in the latter than the \nformer (Sylva et al., 2004), even though the ratios required are less favourable.  One \nreason for this relates to the legislative requirement for staff in nursery schools and \nclasses to be school teachers.   \n \nQualification levels are far higher in nursery schools and primary schools: over 30%  \nof all paid staff are qualified to at least level 6 (first degree) compared with 4% in \nproviders providing full day care or sessional provision (Nicholson et al., 2008).  \nTeachers are of course more expensive to employ than staff with lower levels of \nqualification: the average hourly pay in school settings of all paid early years staff \n 19 \nwas around \u00a313.00; in private and voluntary provision it was around \u00a37.00 (Nicholson \net al., 2008).  Staff qualifications thus vary markedly depending on the type of \nprovider, which is undoubtedly related to the quality of provision.   \n \nThe question then arises as to the overall adequacy of government funding to provide \nhigh quality, accessible and affordable early years education.  Interviews with key \ninformants suggest that the overall allocation of resources is not sufficient.  It appears \nthat across most types of provider, funds outside the free early years funding are used \nto subsidise early years provision.  It is not possible to generalise across all providers \nin the country on the basis of our analysis, but the research does raise issues about the \nadequacy of the funding regime.   \n \nPrivate and voluntary sector providers appear to subsidise the government\u2019s early \nyears funding with parental fees and\/or from other funds.  Whilst a single funding \nformula for early years is to be introduced in 2010 (DCSF, 2008b) it is by no means \nclear that this will solve the problems highlighted as the key problem, except in the \nschool settings, appears to be the unit of resource.  And even in these settings there \nappears to be some cross-subsidisation.  PVI providers receive no capital funding and \nhave outgoings that schools do not.  Private and voluntary providers also pay their \nstaff less and their staff are less highly qualified.  On the other hand they also have to \noperate higher staff: child ratios than nursery classes (and indeed reception classes in \nprimary schools), which means that they need more staff.  Where private providers do \nseek to improve the quality of staff \u2013 as in the case of the small nursery chain in this \nstudy \u2013 fees may become prohibitive and exclusive. \n \nThis raises a number of issues.  If universal high quality early years education is to be \navailable it might be expected that there would be a policy goal for the qualification \nlevels of staff to be similar and for the staff ratios to be similar.  All providers are \nsubject to the same regulatory framework regarding the educational elements of the \nEYFS.  Although government policy is moving in the direction of a more highly \nqualified workforce, there is some way to go \u2013 and it is not clear how the policy \naspiration for a graduate worker in every setting will be achieved without a \ncommitment to sustained extra public funding.  \n \n 20 \nIt would however be a retrograde step if eliding the distinction between the childcare \nand educational functions of early years provision had the effect of reducing either the \nquantity or quality of provision in the best early years services.  For example, it \nremains to be seen how single funding formulae for early years providers will affect \nfunding levels for different providers.  Similarly, requiring high quality providers to \noffer more flexible models for the free entitlement may also have an impact on the \nquality of service provided.  Also while the EYFS is intended to assure parents of the \nquality of service their children will receive it is important that it does not obscure \ndifferences in the quality of service provided in different settings. \n   \nIn addition one informant saw current policy emphasis on the market working against \nthe highest quality provision: \nthey call it the market, the childcare market\u2026 either you believe in high \nquality education and care or you believe that you\u2019re just looking after \nchildren while parents go to work and [the government have] never really \nsorted that out and increasingly it looks like the market is rising high. \n \nOn the other hand another informant, from the private sector, made a number of \ncriticisms of government policy and behaviour which broadly find fault with \nperceived deviation from market principles and consequent inefficiency.  For this \nparticipant, it is historically the freedom of generous funding which has created higher \ncosts in the state sector, including the employment of teachers.     \n \nAnother issue relates to the potential for the system in England to result in segregation \nbecause of the different fees and policies, with some children being more likely to \nattend certain types of provider than others.  Thus, in terms of access there is a \nchallenge in that provision outside the free early years entitlement in the private and \nvoluntary sectors is, in the main subject to fees, determined on the basis of what the \nmarket will bear.  It is not clear that the ethos of the market is compatible with these \nvarious requirements.   \n \nTo conclude this paper has argued that although progress has been made in terms of \nearly years educational provision, policy militates against high quality, affordable and \n 21 \naccessible provision for all children.  Regulations differ, resource allocation differs, \ncosts vary and fees charged vary.  The highest quality provision is likely to remain \nthat provided by certain maintained sector providers because of regulatory \nrequirements for qualified teachers and indeed the pooling of resources at school \nlevel.  Government policy is encouraging both a market and high quality provision,  \nbut high quality is likely to be related to highly qualified staff.  Only when providers \nof all types are required to adhere to similar regulations and receive similarly high \nlevels of funding is universal access to high quality provision a possibility.  This of \ncourse will be dependent on increased public funding and a willingness of the tax \npayer to see the value of high quality early years education and care.  This raises the \nnotion of what provision should entail and whether a more holistic approach should \nbe adopted.  In Denmark, as elsewhere in continental Europe, there is a pedagogical \ndiscourse which sees learning, care and upbringing as indivisible activities; such a \nshift, along with the development of services, could, as in Denmark, change parents\u2019 \nviews about upbringing and increase demand (Moss, 2006), so resulting in high \nquality provision being available to all children, including those most in need.   \n \nReferences \n \nChildcare Act (2006) (c. 21) London: HMSO. \nhttp:\/\/www.opsi.gov.uk\/acts\/acts2006\/pdf\/ukpga_20060021_en.pdf \n \nChildren\u2019s Workforce Development Council (2009) How do I become an EYP? \nLeeds: CWDC. \nhttp:\/\/www.cwdcouncil.org.uk\/eyps\/how-to-become-an-eyp \n \nCirius (2009) Pre-school and pre-school class. \nhttp:\/\/en.ciriusonline.dk\/education-in-denmark\/the-danish-education-system\/pre-\nschool \n \nCommission of the European Communities (2008) Progress towards the Lisbon \nobjectives in education and training, Brussels: CEC. \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/education\/lifelong-learning-policy\/doc\/report08\/report_en.pdf \n 22 \n \nCouncil of the European Union (2002) Presidency Conclusions Barcelona European \nCouncil 15 and 16 March 2002.

Day nurseries, playgroups and day-care \ncentres where staff are not required to hold a qualification in education are not \nincluded\u2019 (Eurydice, 2009, p. 63).   \n2\n The focus on the EU-15 is to make comparisons manageable. \n3\n Compulsory education begins at different ages: 4 in Northern Ireland, 5 in Great \nBritain and the Netherlands, 7 in Finland and Sweden and at 6 in the remaining 11 \nEU-15 countries (NFER, 2009). \n4\n In England, education is compulsory from the term after a child reaches five years of \nage. \n5\n Including reception classes catering for children in the year before compulsory \nschooling begins. \n6\n Children\u2019s centres, first established in 2003, support children under five and their \nfamilies, via access to health services, support for parenting and families, support for \nthe unemployed, drop in sessions and outreach services (DIUS, DCSF and WAG, \n2009). \n7\n In 2006, 40,050 children attended full day provision in 836 designated centres; half \nwere under 3 (HC, 2008b). \n8\n Early years providers include maintained schools, independent (fee-charging) \nschools, and childcare registered by Ofsted on the Early Years Register (DCSF, \n2008a).   \n9\n The 13 scales which relate to the six areas include for example social development, \nemotional development, linking sounds and letters, writing, physical development.  \nEach is associated with a nine-point scale ranging from progressing towards the \nachievements in the particular learning goal to achieving all the points in the goal in \nquestion (DCSF, 2008a).   \n10\n For 2008, the costs were up to a maximum of \u00a3175 per week for one child (in \nwhich case \u00a3140 would be the maximum amount of childcare element available) or \n 28 \n                                                                                                                                            \n\u00a3300 for two or more children (\u00a3240 would be payable).  The parent claims the \nchildcare element by completing a tax credit claim form which entails the parent \ncalculating the average weekly costs or likely costs (if different amounts are paid at \ndifferent times).  The parent is also required to provide details of the childcare \nprovider which may be checked with the provider by HMRC (HMRC, 2009). \n11\n For 2009, the childcare grant covers up to \u00a3148.75 per week for one child or \u00a3225 if \nmore than one (Directgov, 2009b) (this rrequires completion of relevant sections on \nthe student finance application). \n12\n Employers may also contribute via directly contracted childcare or workplace \nnurseries and employees would similarly be exempt from tax and national insurance \ncontributions (HMRC, 2008). \n13\n Parents may not claim WTC for childcare provision covered by the NEG and so \nmust decide which to claim.  Similarly parents must decide whether to make use of \nemployer vouchers or WTC as the two are mutually exclusive.  \n14\n The data in Table 1 relates to the UK and in Table 1 to England.  The definitions \nused also differ.   \n15\n Lewis (2009) provides an extensive discussion of work\u2013family policy packages, \nincluding childcare services, in the EU-15.   \n"}
