ABSTRACT \n \nA new mathematical method, the Phase Distribution Model, is devised for the calculation of attenuation and scattering \nof THz radiation in random materials.

INTRODUCTION \n \nAt Durham, we are carrying out parallel theoretical and experimental work to develop an understanding of THz \nattenuation and scattering in randomly structured materials such as clothing and powders. On the one hand, scattering \nhas adverse effects: it may produce false signatures in spectra when interference takes place within a scattering structure \n(e.g. fibres in clothing or granules of powder), or diminish and scramble the return signal from a suspect item secreted \nbelow garments. On the other hand, it might be used to advantage to determine the characteristic size, texture and \nlocation of an object concealed within a matrix of other material. Scattering effects are particularly relevant in this \nspectral regime, where the wavelength, and the size and separation of scattering centres, are often commensurable. \n \nA mathematical model is needed to relate THz propagation to the physical properties of the material. Exact solutions of \nMaxwell's equations are prohibitively difficult for random structures; so empirical approximation methods are needed. \nThis is of especial significance in practical systems for the recognition of hidden illegal substances on a suspect some \ndistance from the observer. Although considerable previous work has been published in this area, it is evident that \nagreement between theory and experiment is not always good, especially for an assembly of closely-packed scatterers: \nfor example, Pearce and Mittleman [1] have determined the mean free path for scattering through a dense collection of \nsphere and compared with the predictions of both exact (Mie) scattering and a quasi-crystal approximation; typical \ndifferences of  one order of magnitude are shown between experiment and theory. \n \nIn view of the need to develop a mathematical procedure to predict rapidly the scattering and attenuation properties of \nan inhomogeneous material, we have developed a Phase Distribution Model (PDM). Modelling proceeds by dividing \nthe material into slices perpendicular to the incident beam, with slice thickness chosen to satisfy two criteria: \n \n(a) The thickness should be great enough that there is no average correlation between the scatterer positions in \nadjacent slices and interference effects between scattered waves for different slices will average out; \n \n(b) The slice should be thin enough to allow simple approximations for transmission to be used. \n \nThe first requirement is to produce a satisfactory model for the attenuation of the direct beam. The accuracy of the \nmodel can be checked by comparison with exact calculations and with measurements on specifically constructed \nartefacts with known physical properties. Similar comparisons for a model of scattering then follow. The measurements \nreported here are undertaken with a standard broadband spectrometer system of the type reported elsewhere [2]. The \nbandwidth available is approximately 3THz.   \n \nTechnologies for Optical Countermeasures II; Femtosecond Phenomena II; Passive Millimetre-Wave & Terahertz Imaging II,\ned. by D.H.

PHASE DISTRIBUTION MODEL \n \nTransmission of a plane incident wave of unit amplitude through the slice results in a variation of amplitude a(\u03c1) and \nphase \u03c6(\u03c1) with co-ordinate \u03c1 over the second surface. The forward propagating unscattered wave amplitude is given by \n \n \n2\n( )( ) i\nW\ndF a e\nW\n\u03d5 \u03c1 \u03c1\u03c1= \u222b , \n \nwhere the integral extends over the wavefront, area W. For the calculation of the unscattered wave, the spatial \ndependence of the field is not the significant property, and the relevant information can be summarised in a phase \ndistribution function defined by \n \n \n2\n1 1( ) ( ) ( ( ) )\nW\ndP a\nW\n\u03c1\u03d5 \u03c1 \u03b4 \u03d5 \u03c1 \u03d5= \u2212\u222b . \n \nThus the unscattered amplitude is given by \n \n 1( )\niF P e d\u03d5\u03d5 \u03d5= \u222b , \nand the transmitted intensity through the slice is |F|2.  \n \nThe mean free path for transmission through the complete material is then \n \n 2. . . ln\ndM F P\nF\n= \u2212 , \n \nwhere d is the slice thickness. \n \nThe distribution function is then amenable to a statistical treatment. The problem is thus reduced to finding suitable \napproximations for the calculation of P. \n \nFor an isolated scattering object occupying a small part, S, of the wavefront, W, the total scattering cross-section is \nFigure 1 Projection approximation for phase distribution.  \n \nProc. of SPIE Vol. 5989  598912-2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 15 Nov 2010 to 129.234.252.66.

This can be carried out for any reasonable shapes of \nscatterers. For the case of a sphere, radius b and refractive index n, the resulting phase change distribution is \n \n   2\n2( )\nM\nP \u03d5\u03d5 \u03d5= , \n \nfor 0 < \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c6M, where \u03c6M is the maximum phase change along a path through the centre \n \n  \n4 ( 1)\nM\nb n\u03c0\u03d5 \u03bb\n\u2212= . \n \n \n3. COMPARISONS WITH THEORY AND EXPERIMENT \n \nThe comparison of the resulting calculated cross-section with Mie theory, and a similar comparison for cylindrical \nscatterers are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The agreement is satisfactory over a wide range of wavelengths and diameters \nfor refractive indices not exceeding 2. \n \nFigure 2.  Normalized scattering cross-section for spheres. \n \n \nCalculations of exact solutions of Maxwell's equations for randomly arranged dielectric cylinders, using Pendry's code \n[4], are in progress at Durham. At long wavelengths there is good agreement with the phase distribution picture, but at \nshorter wavelengths the computing is not yet complete. The phase distribution method has also been compared with \nmeasurements of transmission through samples of known physical properties. \n \nAs noted in section 1, above,  Pearce and Mittleman [1] have measured transmission through randomly arranged teflon \nspheres and have found that theoretical treatments based on the 'quasi-crystalline approximation' or Mie theory for \nisolated spheres do not give a satisfactory description of the data.

The data \nfor a variety of shirt fabrics have been successfully modelled using the projected optical density to calculate the phase \nchanges. The yarns are treated as uniform cylinders with an effective refractive index, and diameters of order 0.2 mm. \nThe fibres composing the yarn are typically 20 micron in diameter, too small to be resolved at THz frequencies. The \nparameters of the model are the diameters and spacing of the yarns, which can be measured directly, and the effective \nrefractive index, treated as an empirical parameter. Figure 5 shows that the model is capable of describing a particular \nshirt transmission: fits to data taken by other workers [5] using the PDM indicates that this approach can also \nsatisfactorily describe the attenuation of a range of different fabrics such as polyester, terylene and cotton.  \n \nPhantom test pieces in the form of randomly arranged parallel dielectric cylinders are under construction at Durham for \ninvestigation of attenuation and scattering. All the relevant physical properties of these phantoms, including the THz \nrefractive index of the material, will then be available for a rigorous comparison of theory and experiment. \n \n \n4. PHASE DISTRIBUTION MODEL FOR SCATTERING \n \n \nFigure 6. PDM with oblique projection. \n \nCalculation of scattering in a randomly structured material is dependent on knowledge of the attenuation. If the mean \nfree path is smaller than the sample thickness, multiple scattering and diffusion is expected. For a long mean free path, \nfirst-order scattering throughout the volume will predominate. The projected optical density method used for calculation \nof the unscattered amplitude is being adapted for the calculation of scattering by a slice containing scatterers. As before, \nthe projected density can be calculated for any reasonably shaped scatterers, and comparison can be made with exact \ncalculations of differential scattering cross-sections for spheres or cylinders in order to develop the method. The oblique \ndirection of projection is taken to be intermediate between incident and scattering directions. Figure 7 shows the \ndifferential cross-section for a dielectric cylinder with refractive index 1.2 for E and H polarisations, together with the \noblique projection approximation. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1.
