[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1846950]\nLegislation concerning the permitted levels of chemicals\nin the atmosphere together with the public awareness of en-\nvironmental and health issues have made the detection of\npollutants a high research priority for scientists and\nengineers.1\u20134 There are many physical principles upon which\nsensing systems might be based; changes in electrical resis-\ntance (chemiresistors),5,6 refractive index (fibre optic\nsensors),7 and mass (quartz microbalance)8 have all been ex-\nploited. The main challenges in the development of sensors\nare in the production of cheap, reproducible, and reliable\ndevices with adequate sensitivities and selectivities. Electro-\nactive organic materials such as phthalocyanine derivatives\nor conductive polymers are attractive materials for electronic\napplications as they can be dissolved in common solvents\nand processed in thin film form using methods such as spin-\ncoating, thermal evaporation, or inkjet printing. The latter\ntechnique is attracting considerable attention for \u201cplastic\u201d\nelectronics applications such as organic electroluminescent\ndisplays and field effect transistors.9\u201313 Inkjet printing offers\nparticular advantages over other methods for forming thin\nfilms, namely: patterning capability; reduction in waste prod-\nucts; high speed and low cost fabrication; room temperature\ndeposition; and printing on large area and flexible substrates.\nHere, we describe a chemical sensing device\u2014a \u201cchemical\nfuse\u201d\u2014that can be fabricated by the inkjet printing of a con-\nductive polymer on flexible substrate.\nA commercial HP printer with a resolution of 600\n3600 dots\/ in. was used in this study. The only modification\nrequired was to replace the ink with the polymer solution. A\nwater soluble conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylene diox-\nythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonated acid\n(PEDOT-PSS) was used as the ink to print a 10 mm\n34 mm sensing element onto polyester film (purchased\nfrom ISCA Papers). The PEDOT-PSS was dissolved in a\nmixture of organic solvents (mainly isopropanol) in the ratio\n43% PEDOT:PSS to 57% solvent; the solution was pur-\nchased from Bayer AG. To the PEDOT-PSS solution further\ndiluted with 50% water, 10% ethylene glycol and 1% dode-\ncyl sulfate sodium salt were added to improve the viscosity\nand surface tension and prevent drying and clogging of the\nprinter head. The measured values of these parameters for\nthe printing solution were: viscosity=3.2 cP and surface\ntension=41 mN m\u22121. Multiple layers were made by repeated\nscanning over the same area of substrate. The inkjet printed\nfilms were dried under vacuum at room temperature for more\nthan 12 h to remove any residual solvent.\nThe devices were mounted in a specially constructed\nglass chamber where nitrogen carrier gas containing known\nconcentrations of methanol or ethanol was passed over the\nfilms. The various vapor concentrations were produced using\nthe permeation method.14 Here, the nitrogen was passed over\na permeation vial containing a known quantity of the alcohol\nand held at a constant temperature of 25 \u00b0C. The direct cur-\nrent through the films was measured with a potential differ-\nence applied across the devices using a Keithley 2400 digital\nsource meter. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was under-\ntaken using a Digital Instruments Nanoscope E contact mode\ninstrument.\nThe optical micrographs of the inkjet printed PEDOT-\nPSS films revealed that thin films, one to three printed layers,\nof PEDOT-PSS were in the form of small poorly connected\nislands (average size of 75 mm) of the polymer, while films\ngreater than five printed layers in thickness provided a sig-\nnificantly improved connectivity over the film surface, Fig.\n1. The film morphology was also influenced by the nature of\nthe flexible polyester substrate. Different roughness surfaces\nwere provided by the manufacturer. Rougher surfaces invari-\nably produced a more island-like surface morphology. The\nphysical structure of the inkjet printed PEDOT-PSS was re-\nflected in measurements of the electrical resistance of the\nchemiresistor elements (in-plane measurements at room tem-\nperature). The highest electrically conductive films were pro-\nduced when individual islands had coalesced to form a con-\ntinuous film. To achieve this, all the inkjet-printed layers\nwere printed in as short a time as possible, allowing the\nindividual islands to merge before the evaporation of the\nsolvents. Figure 2 shows the dependence of the current ver-\nsus voltage characteristics on the thickness of the PEDOT-\nPSS films, i.e., on the number of printed layers. The current\nthrough the organic film increases linearly with increasing\nvoltage but in a nonlinear manner with the increase in the\nnumber of printed layers. These results are in good agree-\nment with the observations from the optical micrographs in\nFig. 1.

Using substrates with rough surfaces made the\ncharge transport in the thin films more difficult and the re-\nsistance of the films exceeded 1 GV.\nPulses of methanol or ethanol vapor were used to obtain\ninformation of the changes in conductivity of the PEDOT-\nPSS films in an alcohol ambient.15 To test the sensitivity and\nthe response time of the sensors, the current through the film\nwas measured as the concentration of the vapor in the nitro-\ngen carrier gas was increased and decreased. After each in-\ncrease in concentration of the vapor, the glass sample cham-\nber was flushed with nitrogen. The measurements were\nperformed on several thin films with thicknesses of one or\ntwo printed layers. The direct current through films was mea-\nsured at an applied voltage of 10\u2013100 V, depending on the\nfilm thickness and the type of substrate. Figure 3 shows the\nresponse of thin film (a single inkjet-printed layer) of\nPEDOT-PSS exposed to 5000 ppm of methanol. The initial\nexposure to the vapor resulted in a rapid and nonreversible\ndecrease in the current. A similar effect was noted for films\nof two or three printed layers of PEDOT-PSS, but, generally,\nthe thicker films exhibited longer response times (more than\n2 h for a three-layer film). In our preliminary experiments,\nthe inkjet-printed chemiresistors responded to both methanol\nand ethanol vapors. However, the devices were slightly more\nsensitive to methanol.\nA completely different response was observed for thick\nfilms, greater than about five inkjet-printed layers. In these\ncases, increases in the conductivity were noted on exposure\nto alcohol vapor. These effects were reversible, apart from\nthe initial exposure where a larger conductivity increase was\nobserved, and are consistent with the suggestion that polar\nsolvents with high dielectric constants can induce a screen-\ning effect between counter ions and charge carriers.16 This\nreduces the Coulomb interaction between positively charged\nPEDOT and negatively charged PSS dopant, thereby enhanc-\ning the hopping rate and dc conductivity.\nThe irreversible decrease in conductivity for the very\nthin inkjet printed sensor is almost certainly the result of a\nvapor-induced change in structure of the organic film. The\nmorphology of the as-deposited inkjet-printed layer will de-\npend on the contact angle between the PEDOT-PSS and the\nunderlying substrate.17 This is influenced by the chemical\n(degree of polarity) and physical (degree of roughness) na-\nture of the substrate. Figure 1 shows that first inkjet-printed\nPEDOT-PSS layer is in the form of a series of disconnected\nislands on the roughened polyester support. As further layers\nare printed, the individual droplets grow and coalesce until a\ncontinuous organic film is produced. If a one- or two-layer\nPEDOT-PSS film is exposed to the vapor of an alcohol, the\nFIG. 1. (Color online) Optical micrographs of inkjet-printed PEDOT-PSS\nlayers.

There-\nfore, the electrical connection between the PEDOT-PSS is-\nlands is lost and the current passing through the organic film\nfalls effectively to zero (in the case of an insulating sub-\nstrate). When the vapor is turned off, the polar PEDOT-PSS\nmolecules are preferentially adsorbed onto the existing is-\nlands of the polymer rather than onto the substrate. The mor-\nphology of the inkjet-printed film has thereby been perma-\nnently altered.\nWe propose that our inkjet-printed chemical sensor can\nbe used as a type of \u201cchemical fuse,\u201d i.e., a single shot device\nto raise an alarm in the presence of organic vapors, espe-\ncially alcohols, with concentrations above a particular\nthreshold.18 The operating principle of the device, as de-\nscribed earlier, is illustrated shown in Fig. 4, which includes\nAFM images of a single inkjet-printed PEDOT-PSS layer\nbefore and after exposure to methanol (note the scale differ-\nence with Fig. 1). The AFM image of the as-deposited film\nshows little detail associated with the PEDOT-PSS and can\nbe attributed to the underlying polyester substrate. However,\nfollowing exposure to methanol, the AFM image reveals a\ndistinct change in the thin film morphology (a control experi-\nment verified that there was no effect of the alcohol vapor on\nan uncoated substrate). As the response of the devices de-\npends on the layer thickness, the sensitivity can be controlled\nby variation in the number of printed layers of the PEDOT-\nPSS. An analogy can be made with the choice of an appro-\npriate thickness metal wire in a conventional electrical fuse.\nThe nature of the substrate will also be important. For ex-\nample, contact angles can be influenced by changing the\nroughness of a surface.17\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated an inkjet-printed\nPEDOT-PSS chemical fuse to detect the presence of organic\nvapors with concentrations above a particular threshold. The\nsensor can be operated at room temperature and under nor-\nmal laboratory environments. This particular device might\nfind use as the sensing element in a disposable handheld\nbreathalyzer or as a sensing element in an ALCOLOCK19\ndevice. Other thin film deposition methods (e.g., thermal\nevaporation, Langmuir\u2013Blodgett deposition, self-assembly)\nand\/or different organic compounds might be used to provide\na wide range of chemical fuse sensors.\nThis work was supported by Durham County Council\nunder the Science and Technology for Business and Enter-\nprise Programme SP\/082.
