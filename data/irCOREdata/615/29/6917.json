We argue here that these\narrangements provide a basis for continued co-operation between authors and future development as the\ntechnology changes..\nIntroduction\nOf all the TLTP projects, the UKMCC (UK Mathematics Courseware Consortium) has\ninvolved the largest number of institutions in authoring courseware. This was part of a\ndeliberate attempt to set up an 'open courseware' system which can continue to be adapted and\ngrow even after the end of TLTP funding. In turn, such an objective requires a cross-platform\napproach to courseware development. Even when considering the academic community across\na single subject at just one time, there will be a variety of hardware and software that people\nwill want to use, but a ghost of a case can be made out for attempting some sort of\nstandardization. When change over time is considered, it is inconceivable that hardware and\nsoftware platforms will remain unchanging, and one way to manage changing standards is to\nhave a courseware structure that permits variety. This allows different parts of a collection of\nmaterials to evolve at different speeds.\nThe UKMCC is writing mathematics courseware, but all the issues raised above will arise in\nmany other disciplines. This paper will also deal briefly with three other issues, which\nalthough general in themselves may require different solutions in different disciplines:\n\u2022 Who should write courseware, academics or programmers?\n22\nALT-J Volume 4 Number \/\n\u2022 How should courseware be used?\n\u2022 What is the future of courseware?\nThe UKMCC\nEven before the TLTP was announced, the learning-technology community in university\nmathematics was considering ways to secure wide involvement in courseware writing. This\nwas a result of a large collaboration under the older CTI (Computers in Teaching Initiative)\n(Harding, 1993), in turn leading to the setting up of the CTI Centre for Maths and Stats\n(CTICMS) at Birmingham. Two pilot projects (Maths 2 CD-ROM, 1989-1991; Harding,\n1994) had gathered sufficient experience and demonstration materials to attract recruits for the\nUKMCC. Over 30 authors (see Acknowledgements) from 26 institutions joined together to\nform the UKMCC, and an early account of the UKMCC is given in Beilby (1993).\nPhase 1 of the UKMCC effectively spanned two and a half years from Autumn 1992 to Spring\n1995. During this period, a basic authoring style was established and 30 modules were\ncommissioned from authors, to cover the basic topics in the SEFI (Socie'te' Europe'enne pour la\nFormation des Ingenieurs) syllabus. The SEFI syllabus is primarily meant for engineering\nmathematics, but it is a comprehensive international standard and has met with general\napproval amongst members of the UKMCC as a suitable syllabus for service course\nmathematics in the sciences. Phase 2 is nominally from April 1995 to the end of March 1996,\nduring which time a further 20 modules are planned, although because of the way that authors\nplan their time, these will not all be complete until September 1996. A module covers\napproximately the equivalent of four to five hours of conventionally lectured material.\nWho writes courseware?\nIn planning a project to deliver such a large amount of material, there are two poles to the\nstrategies that might be used. One is to use academics as advisers or specifiers of materials and\nhave the implementation done by technical staff. The other pole is to have the academics as\nimplementers. The UKMCC opted for a policy that is closer to the latter pole (authors as\nimplementers) although resource centres specializing in each of the main platforms have been\nset up to provide technical support to authors.\nThe UKMCC s main reasons for leaning towards the authors-as-implementers policy were\npartly to harness the enthusiasm that already existed amongst some academics for courseware\nauthoring, and partly to help increase the level of experience in the academic community in a\nway that would be retained for the academic world at the end of the project. An additional\nreason is an assumption that academics are more likely to use courseware when they have\ncontributed to it themselves, and know that they could change or adapt it themselves as and\nwhen they want.\nMathwise and the Courseware Manager\nOne consequence of the authors-as-implementers policy is that any project adopting it must\neither be prepared to take a draconian line on which authoring platform to use (in regard to\nboth hardware and software), or be prepared to accommodate the usual range of prejudices and\n23\nR D. Harding S. W. Lay and H. Moule Co-operative cross-platform courseware development\npreferences amongst academics in computing matters. To involve as much of the subject\ncommunity as possible, the UKMCC wanted to accommodate almost any preference, but there\nwere two provisos. The first was that there had not to be so much diversity that student users\nwere confused (by different interface conventions for example), nor had this to hinder\ncourseware written by one author being referenced from materials written by others. The\nsecond proviso was that in a project with finite resources it was not feasible to offer support for\nan unlimited variety of platforms.\nThe consensus that was reached within the UKMCC was to use PC and Macintosh hardware,\nand Toolbook, HyperCard and Authorware as software for authoring. Software was thought to\nbe of greater long-term significance than hardware choice, as industry is developing hardware\nwhich will run any major operating system suitable for personal systems, and we are also\nseeing more packages flike Authorware) which work across platforms.\nTo contain the natural diversity of authoring styles to an acceptable level, and to create a look\nand feel to be the hallmark of UKMCC modules, a document known as the Courseware\nDesign Specification was produced. This was based on the experience of the Renaissance\n(Harding et al, 1995) and Nuffield (Harding, 1994) projects, developed in discussions with all\nUKMCC partners. Plans were drawn up for a supporting environment within which modules\nwould run. The whole system of environment plus modules was given the name Mathwise.\nFigure 1 shows a typical screen from a Mathwise module: Solutions of Linear Equations.\nCramer's rule\nCramer's Rule provides a systematic procedure for the solution of systems of linear equations.\nThe solution method makes it very easy to count the number of solutions.

However, it became clear at an early stage that none of these built-in facilities would\nallow cross-linking to be done in a fully satisfactory manner. This led us to design a separate\npiece of software which can link together documents written under any application (on the\nMacintosh for example, such documents could be HyperCard stacks, Authorware packages,\nMicrosoft Word files, Maple or Excel documents, etc.). This software we call the Courseware\nManager; distinct versions are needed for PC and the Macintosh, but it has essentially the same\nfunctions on each. A fuller description has been published elsewhere (Harding et al, 1995).\nTo be usable under the Courseware Manager, a piece of courseware must conform to the\nsimple structural rules contained in the Courseware Design Specification, as illustrated in\nFigure 2. There is now a TLTP-supported working group, EPOC (Enabling the Provision of\nOpen Courseware), with one of us (Lay) as a member (URL: http:\/\/www.amtp.cam.ac.\nuk\/icrd\/EPOC\/). Once a generally agreed open standard exists, Mathwise will want to conform.\nSuch a standard (Mathwise's own, then a fully open standard in the future) underpins the\nachievement of many of the UKMCC's objectives. Although for the present, UKMCC authors\nmay prefer to stick with our major choices of authoring packages because help and advice is\navailable for them, there is no technical reason why materials authored using other systems\nshould not be included. In Phase 2, one author will be using SuperCard, and in the future\nauthors can migrate to newer and better systems as they become available. Older courseware\nwill remain compatible (although of course there is no magic way that it can improve itself!).\nUser sites are able to customize Mathwise by removing, adding or replacing any courseware\ncomponent that is visible to the operating system as a single file or collection of files. This\nR D. Harding S. W. Lay and H. Moule Co-operative cross-platform courseware development\nprocess may, of course, require some authoring work by the user site, and the use of the\nCourseware Manager's administrative facilities.\nLearning style\nMathwise can be used in any of the following ways: in place of lectures, as partial replacement\nfor lectures, as an addition to lectures, or as a library resource.\nInstitutions will need to decide how to manage the use of these materials, and incorporate\nadvice and directions for use into their standard procedures. Students' access to the materials\nalso needs consideration. There could be central or distributed labs, with scheduled hours,\nbookable individual seats, or just free access. There could be network access via students' own\nmachines in their halls of residence.\nOur courseware design and the Courseware Manager itself are intended to make it easy for\nlecturers to configure Mathwise modules, and any other courseware materials required that\nconform to the courseware standard.\nThe future of courseware\nThe basic character of any body of courseware, its ease of use, modularity, availability across\ncampus, adaptability to local conditions, etc., is inextricably linked to the style in which\ncourseware will be used. Unfortunately, it seems to us that the TLTP has not addressed the\nissues adequately: not only should the demand for courseware be addressed (as discussed\nfurther below) but, in addition, career issues such as incentives and support for staff to\nintroduce new techniques into their teaching need to be considered.\nImproved effectiveness of learning has been a major objective of educational computing since\nCAL first became a technical possibility. However, there is very little evidence from\nexperience or in the literature that computers can replace human teachers in higher education,\nand the evidence points to computing costs being add-on, and the benefits being enhancement\nof education rather than replacement of older methods. Hooper's final report (1977) on the\nNDPCAL nearly 20 years ago made this clear, and although since then the technology has\nmade huge advances, the basic modes of use of computers in teaching and their likely\neffectiveness has remained much as summarized by Hooper. It is disheartening that either the\nlessons of the NDPCAL were not known to TLTP policy makers, or that no public debate was\nconducted to explain why it was thought that dramatic changes were imminent.\nSupporting the authoring of courseware is only half of the equation, the supply side. Consortia\nlike the UKMCC have no control over the adoption and use of their products. It is necessary to\nmake an informed guess at all the ways institutions will use courseware and try to write\nappropriate materials, but no project can guarantee that materials will be adopted. There needs\nto be a demand-side policy as well, and it is here that the signals from HEFCE are most\nconfusing. Assurances have been given that successful efforts in courseware development will\nbe recognized in research and teaching assessment exercises, but there is scant evidence that\nlecturers feel there has been any change in the link between their efforts in this direction and\ncareer development. Perhaps ALT has a vital role to play here?\n26\nVolume 4 Number I\nAcknowledgements\nDavid Asche, Neil Challis, Jean Cook, Douglas Curran, Maureen Foster, Martin Greenhow,\nDavid Griffel, Jon Greenman, David Harding, Pat Hawkshaw, Graham Hendry, Stephen\nHibberd, David Hodgkinson, John Kingston, Ron Knott, Eric Lawrence, Duncan Lawson,\nMichael McCabe, George McGuire, Diana Mackie, Walter Middleton, John O'Connor, Enid\nPinch, Neil Pitcher, David Poutney, Douglas Quinney, Peter Rangecroft, Edmund Robertson,\nDouglas Siviter, Peter Soan, Jim Tabor, Alan Thomas, Geoff Wood and Mike Yates.\nReferences\nBeilby, M.
