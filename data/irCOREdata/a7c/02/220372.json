Introduction: Damastes the subduer and Clever Hans the horse \nProcrustes, also called Damastes --- the subduer --- a famous Greek bandit, reputedly \nstretched his victims, or cut off their legs, so as to make them fit the size of an iron bed.  \nUnpleasant as this may seem, we scientists do the same to the phenomena we capture and \nanalyse. This paper presents techniques which address the problem and should be of interest \nto all social scientists.  \nFirst we frame the issue; then we describe the techniques in enough pragmatic detail to make \nthem transferrable to the reader; finally we give quick illustrations of their power.  \nAs the first sections may appear very methodological, we suggest the reader takes a quick \nlook at the pictures in section 6.1 (p. XX): they should motivate reading the whole piece. \n\u2018Damastism\u2019 (the influence of the observer\/analyst in the construction of results) can happen \nwhen using rigid codification techniques, e.g. in questionnaires. Or by forcing our own \ninterpretive perspective onto the phenomenon \u2013 an aspect of what Devereux calls \u2018counter-\ntransference\u2019 in analogy with the impacts of the psychoanalyst\u2019s own unconscious processes \nin the analytic cure (Devereux 1967). \nMore generally, any interpretation is an abductive process in which the researcher gradually \nconstructs some mapping between phenomena and a model, and in doing so she adapts both \nthe model and the data (yes, I mean: also the data) to get some acceptable fit. \nDamastism is a tough epistemological issue. It is not simply about biasing the data; it is about \ninfluencing their very construction, even in physics (Heisenberg 1927). This includes \ninducing (unconsciously) the phenomena themselves, and not only the data, to conform to the \nexpectations of the researcher, a phenomenon well documented in social science (Rosenthal \n1966). For example, in interaction, non-verbal cues given away by the researcher may \ninfluence subjects; the mere fact the subject is aware of being observed may also.  \nThis is true even with animal subjects. The famous case of \u2018Clever Hans\u2019 (a horse said to be \nable to count, and gave the results of additions by tapping the floor with its hoof) was finally \nelucidated when Oskar Pfungst noticed that the horse sensed the non-verbal reaction of \nspectators to its tapping and adjusted its \u2018answers\u2019 accordingly (Pfungst 1911).  \nInfluence of the researcher\u2019s subculture on the data has been vastly discussed in gender or \nintercultural studies and by post-modernism, especially regarding the influence of Western, \nmale, and dominant culture; but Damastism is an epistemological issue even before it is a \npolitical one. \nAlthough such effects are unavoidable in research, new technical possibilities of recording \nfrom the subjects\u2019 perspective and involving them in the analysis somewhat change the nature \nof the relation between observer and observee. They open amazing avenues for social science \nand technological progress recently made this technique accessible at low cost. \n \n \n4 \n \nThis paper is about that major step forward and presents a general method of subjective \nevidence-based ethnography, based on: \n- first person audio-visual recording with a miniature video-camera worn at eye-level; \n- confronting subjects with the first person recordings to collect their subjective experience; \n- formulating the findings and discussing the final interpretation with the subjects. \nSection 2 will address the issue of capturing and translating individual perspective on activity. \nSection 3 shows how the method enables going beyond the current limitations. Section 4 \ndetails the equipment, the protocols for capture and analysis. Section 5 shows what the \ntechniques teaches us about the perspective of the other. Section 6 gives quick but thought \nprovoking illustration of why the method is revolutionary. Section 7 highlights the limitations. \n2. Capture and translation: catching the fish and canning the fish \nThe problem is twofold. First, understanding how the situation is lived from the perspective of \nthe subject (catching the fish). Then translating and publishing this experience into some \nunderstandable, transferrable, description (canning the fish); while avoiding as much as \npossible to project inadequate preconceptions of the observer on the phenomenon. \n2.1. Catching the fish \nSocial sciences have developed and perfected over the years various methods to collect \nempirical data about individual experience (activity, thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, etc.) which \nare described in classic manuals (Bauer and Gaskell 2000; Evans 2010; Flick 2006). \nQuantitative techniques are often stigmatized as being narrow-sighted and simplistic (because \nthey overlook what is not planned in the collection process), or \u2018Damastic\u2019 for such purpose \nbecause they force all the data into a single rigid format. Qualitative techniques are open in \ntheir approach but suffer from similar pitfalls, although in a more subtle way. Data collection \nis usually the result of some interaction between the researcher and the data source, and in this \nprocess the data collected undergo a construction process which may heavily depend upon the \nposition and skills of the researcher. For this reason, qualitative techniques are often criticized \nas having some \u2018black-box\u2019 character by the advocates of quantitative techniques (the black \nbox being the researcher). \nThis dispute has now somewhat cooled off with both sides publicly admitting that all \ntechniques have something to bring in. Also, it should be noted that opposing quantitative and \nqualitative is simplistic, since in the detail most methods tend to include both aspects to some \ndegree, and in many cases combine them with some experimental design. But, as Claude \nBernard noted, there is not an essential difference between observations and experiments: the \n \n \n5 \ndifference is that in experiments the experimenter creates some specific conditions for \nobservation, in order to better control for them (Bernard 1865: 44-54). Therefore the problems \nof observation remain even there. \n \n\u2018The ultimate goal of qualitative research is to understand those being studied from their \nperspective\u201d (Gorman, Clayton, Rice-Lively and Gorman 1997: 23). Social sciences, and \nespecially Psychology, Sociology and Anthropology are interested in understanding other \npeople\u2019s perspective, modelling it, and making these findings explicit. Various techniques to \nelicit expression of \u2018natural\u2019 thought, through free association (Freud and Breuer 1895), non-\ndirective or semi-directive interview, life stories, etc. have been used, and most come in the \nform of  \u2018verbal reports\u2019 (Ericsson and Simon 1980). \nThese techniques suffer from a series of biases. Confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998) whereby \nthe researcher tends to find (only) what she\u2019s looking for, is the most prominent, but many \nothers have been documented in the literature \u2013 see e.g. (Droz 1984) for a list.  \nIntrospection is a somewhat specific case, because it is, as Boring notes (Boring 1953), \nimplicitly at the root of all verbal protocols where the subject is asked to describe internal \nstates, from attitudes to representations or feelings. Therefore it deserves our special attention. \nIntrospection is \u2018looking into our own minds and reporting what we there discover\u2019 (James \n1890, vol. I, p. 185). But, as James describes it well, the stream of consciousness is a \ncontinuous flow, elusive, constantly changing, and situation-dependent; and hence \ntranscribing it into \u2018observations\u2019 is not a trivial task.  \nTo date, since introspection is limited to one\u2019s own perspective, we have no empirical direct \naccess to the individual experience of the Other. Some even argue it is impossible (Nisbett \nand Wilson 1977). The seminal discussion by Wundt, who introduced the introspection \nprocess in psychological investigation (Selbstbeobachtung: self-observation), is illuminating \nin this respect: \nThe endeavour to observe oneself must inevitably introduce changes into the course of \nmental events, - changes which could not have occurred without it, and whose usual \nconsequence is that the very process which was to have been observed disappears from \nconsciousness. (Wundt 1904, p. 5)  \nTherefore, Wundt advocates for an experimental introspection, which is at the root of modern \nexperimental psychology; for him only the experimental method can make scientific \nintrospection possible. \nThe psychological experiment (\u2026) creates external conditions that look towards the \nintroduction of a determinate mental process at a given moment. In the second place, it \nmakes the observer so far master of the general situation, that the state of consciousness \naccompanying this process remains approximately unchanged. The great importance of \n \n \n6 \nthe experimental method, therefore, lies not simply in the fact that, here as in the \nphysical realm, it enables us arbitrarily to vary the conditions of our observations, but \nalso and essentially in the further fact that it makes observation itself possible for us. \n(Wundt 1904, p. 5, italics mine) \nAs we see, the problem is framed upon the assumption that \u2018endeavour to observe oneself \nmust inevitably introduce changes into the course of mental events\u2019. Reflexivity takes time \nand attention indeed, which would disturb the subject in the flow of action. What we argue \nhere is: after the fact, provided with the relevant cues, the subject can clinically provide a \ndetailed and grounded in evidence comment of her mental processes; without disturbing these \nsince the action already has taken place. This is precisely what new recording techniques \nenable. We called \u2018entheaty\u2019 (from the Greek \u03b8\u03b5\u03ac\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, \u2018to gaze at a spectacle\u2019, as in a theatre) \nthe situation, recently enabled by technology but recent in Human history, where B observes a \nsituation recorded from A\u2019s perspective (Lahlou, 2006). Self-entheaty is the situation where \none observes his own actions on record. Reconciliation of internal and external views is the \nheart of the matter. \n2.2. Emic and Etic \nThe issue of external vs. internal observer has been addressed mostly in anthropology, and \nespecially ethnography, where the status of the observer is a crucial problem (DeAndrade \n2000; Del Casino 2001; Eppley 2006; Young 2005). But set in cultural terms (what is it to be \nan insider?) it is aporetic because insider-outsider is a continuum: we do always share \nsomething as Human beings, and at the other end of the continuum, the very fact one is a \nresearcher somehow excludes him from being a \u2018mere\u2019 insider even in his own in-group \n(Weaver-Zercher 2005). \nThe topic is usually debated by comparing \u2018emic\u2019 and \u2018etic\u2019 perspectives(Pike 1967). Emic \nrefers to a description in terms of the actor, while etic refers to a description by an observer in \nculturally neutral terms (in practice: scientific). There has been some debate over the notions, \nwith the founder (Pike, first edition of his book in 1954) and developers of the notion (mainly \nHarris and Goodenough) holding opposite views (Harris 1976; Headland, Pike and Harris \n1990). See Headland\u2019s (1990) exhilarating history of the concept, which nevertheless sheds \nlight on the nature of the concepts: \n(\u2026) the terms are defined in the literature in many different and --- in my view --- \nusually inadequate ways. (\u2026) Some authors equate emic and etic with verbal versus \nnonverbal, or as specific versus universal, or as interview versus observation, or as \nsubjective knowledge versus scientific knowledge, or as good versus bad, or as ideal \nbehaviour versus actual behaviour, or as description versus theory, or as private versus \npublic, or as ethnographic (i.e., idiosyncratically incomparable) versus ethnological \n \n \n7 \n(comparable cross-culturally). One linguistic dictionary (Ducrot and Todorov, 1979: 36) \nsays emic interprets events according to their particular cultural function, while etic \ncharacterizes events only by spatio-temporal criteria. (Headland 1990) \nThe core of the problem is that we want to describe the experience of the insider, which is \ninevitably constructed from her own cultural and personal history, into an interpretation that \ncould be transferrable into someone else\u2019s life world. The emic\/etic refers initially to the \ndifference between phonemics and phonetics. Phonemes are elementary units of sound \ndistinguished by the speakers of a given language, while phonetics focuses on the physical \ndescription of the sound of human speech: the categories used for description are different.  \nAn example of a phoneme is the \/k\/ sound in the words kit and skill. (In transcription, \nphonemes are placed between slashes, as here.) Even though most native speakers don't \nnotice this, in most dialects, the k sounds in each of these words are actually \npronounced differently: they are different speech sounds, or phones (which, in \ntranscription, are placed in square brackets). In our example, the \/k\/ in kit is aspirated, \n[k\u02b0], while the \/k\/ in skill is not, [k]. The reason why these different sounds are \nnonetheless considered to belong to the same phoneme in English is that if an English-\nspeaker used one instead of the other, the meaning of the word would not change: using \n[k\u02b0] in skill might sound odd, but the word would still be recognized. [Wikipedia, article \n\u2018phoneme\u2019, accessed 02\/02\/2010]. \nMore generally, the categories used to describe phenomena in one\u2019s own culture may differ \nfrom those used in an external description, and this sends back to classical debates on how far \nlanguage itself might frame how we perceive our world (Hunt and Agnoli 1991; Whorf and \nCarroll 1956). In practice, for our observation problem, this means that the observer may \nproduce inadequate accounts of phenomena. An external observer could consider as different \nevents what natives consider as insignificant variations of the same; and vice-versa [1]. \nTherefore, in theory the only way to know what is relevant from the subject\u2019s perspective in \nhis own cultural context (emic perspective) requires to get an insider\u2019s view \u2013 which seems \ncontradictory to accessing it as an external observer. \nIn fact, interpretation is an abductive [2] construction process whereby possible hypotheses \nare explored and confronted to the data by the researcher until some satisfying hypothesis is \nconsidered to be the valid \u2018explanation\u2019. In this interpretive spiral, the researcher is usually \nalone (or discusses with colleagues only), every possible cognitive bias can play, and the \nsubject\u2019s validation is rarely if ever sought. \nWe shall not replicate these debates, but rather show here how we can now go beyond classic \nlimitations and provide a better grounded and deeper access to subjective perspective. \n \n \n8 \n2.3. Subjective evidence-based ethnography \nThe method described infra, subjective evidence-based  ethnography (SEBE), is typical of a \nnew generation of investigation techniques which build on the affordances of Information \nTechnology for recording, annotating and collectively processing data (Goldman 2007; \nHollan and Hutchins 2009; Lahlou 2010; Lewis, Pea and Rosen 2010; Pea 1994, 2006) . As \nPink points out:  \nRecently, uses of video in ethnographic research have developed in tandem with new \ntechnologies, innovations and theoretical perspectives. Shifts from a realist approach to \nvideo as \u2018objective\u2019 reality to the idea of video as representation shaped by specific \nstandpoints of its producers and viewers have encouraged the development of \ncollaborative approaches to the production and interpretation of video images. The \nintroduction of digital video and computer-based techniques seems particularly \nappropriate for the development of these methods and is forming the basis of future \ndevelopment in video research. (Pink 2007: 116) \nSEBE is, as said earlier, based on the combination of three techniques: \n- first person audio-visual recording with a miniature video-camera worn at eye-level \n(subcam); \n- confronting subjects with the first person recordings to collect their subjective experience \nthrough evidence-based, controlled, analytic reconstruction; \n- formulating the findings; and discussing the final interpretation with the subjects. \n \nIn these techniques: \nThe subject records the events from his own situated perspective, in real situations, without \nneeding extra mental load or attention in this process; in doing so provides us with the focus \nof her attention; \nThe subject analyses ex post facto the events with the researcher, when looking at the \nrecordings in detail; \nThe subject checks the validity of the interpretations as reformulated etically by the researcher \n(this does not mean that the subject\u2019s interpretation should always be accepted; nevertheless \nto understand fully a subject\u2019s action one needs to be aware of the way the subject interprets \nits environment or how he accounts for it) \nThe last two steps are a \u2018triangulation\u2019, where two (or more) interpreters with different skills \nand knowledge confront their interpretation of the same material (the subfilm). \nMy colleagues and I have been developing this technique since the 1990\u2019s: the technical \naspects of the capture devices, the methods for accessing the mental states from confrontation \nwith the films and the theories for analysing the data. The focus of my research is to \nunderstand the multiple layers of determinants of human activity at fine-grained level, in real \n \n \n9 \ncontext. We have used the method in a large variety of settings and research objectives: \ninterpersonal relations, individual and group decision-making, collaborative design, meetings, \nworkplace studies, experiments, knowledge transfer, counselling, and of course activity \nanalysis, including using SEBE as one of the instruments to monitor the everyday activity of \nvolunteer workers in a specially designed observation laboratory where natural work activity \nwas continuously monitored, for 10 years by 30 cameras (Lahlou 2008, 2009; Nosulenko and \nSamoylenko 2009a). We have used these techniques alone or in association with other classic \ntechniques, with sometimes subcams on several participants in the same scene. We have \ncombined SEBE with classic filming by external cameras, with panoramic 360 video cameras, \nwith SenseCams (Hodges, Williams, Berry et al. 2006), with remote cameras in \nvideoconferences, with eye-tracking, with physiological monitoring (heart beat rate, blood \npressure, skin resistivity\u2026), and of course with more classic techniques such as interviews, \ncritical incident, questionnaires and lab experiments. In most cases, SEBE proved to be a \nvaluable complement, especially in the initial stages of exploring the problem in natural \nsituations. \nThe first obvious outcome of SEBE is the amazing extent to which individual behaviour is \nframed by the context, and how everyday activity is mainly constituted of chaining automatic \nchunks of activity, often beyond the threshold of conscious decision-making, The material \nhave led to develop models describing these phenomena: \u2018cognitive attractors\u2019 (Lahlou 2000) \ndescribe how some areas of the activity phase space automatically induce specific behaviours; \n\u2018installation theory\u2019 (Lahlou 2008) is an evolutionary framework that shows how culture \nproduces a constructed social world that scaffolds, guides and constrains individual activity at \nthree levels: by the affordances of objects, the embodied mental representations of the \nsubjects, and the coercive power of institutions.  \n \nThis paper will focus on the method, based on the experience of the author and his colleagues \nin developing this technique since 1997, selecting what seems at this point solid and \ntransferrable. While we developed the method primarily as an instrument for our own purpose \nof studying human activity and its determinants, and later for professional training, we believe \nit has other potential applications, for example in therapy and counselling. The reader will \nadapt it to her own purposes. \n \n \n \n10 \n3. Getting beyond limitations of the current methods for collecting and analysing \nsubjective experience \nIn this section we address the two issues that have been highlighted above in epistemic terms: \nunderstanding the phenomenon, and describing it (\u2018catching and canning\u2019). But this time we \nwill tackle the issues directly in operational terms. \nWe consider successively: \nSpatio-temporal issues and the situated perspective in data capture (3.1) \nAttentional focus and episodic memory in sense-making processes (3.2) \nGoals (3.3) \nInterpretation and its explicitation (3.4) \nPresentation and transfer (3.5) \nFor a constructive approach, we will present in the same sections the current gaps and how the \nnew technique deals with them. \n3.1. Spatio-temporal issues: the situated perspective in data collection \nCognition is situated, how subjects act depends upon the context of action (Lave 1988; \nSuchman 1987); therefore if we want to understand what really happens we need a situated \nrecording of the subject\u2019s activity, as close as possible to the actual perspective of the actor. \nCognition is distributed between the subjects and their cultural context (D'Andrade 1989; \nHutchins 1995; Roberts 1964), therefore activity can only be observed realistically \u2018in the \nwild\u2019 (Hutchins 1995): only then can we see the subject confronted with a complete \necological environment. Indeed the determinants of action do not reside solely within the \nindividual: the World is constructed as a cultural \u2018installation\u2019 (Lahlou 2008) which scaffolds, \nguides and constrains human activity at three levels (physical, psychological, institutional). \nTherefore, we need to capture in situ all these determinants (objects, mental states, social \ninteractions\u2026) if we want to understand activity. As Tinbergen noted, \u2018natural experiment\u2019 \n(observing things as they happen in their actual environment, as opposed to trying to replicate \nthem in laboratory) is the main resource for ethology (Tinbergen 1953).This is why using \nnatural experiments in social science have been advocated for (Lazursky 1911), although \nrarely applied. \n \nBut situated capture entails some classic problems for data collection. First, even video \nrecording is inevitably a selection process (Rieken and Lahlou 2010). Activity was on-going \nbefore the camera was turned on and will continue after it is turned off. Then, depending on \n \n \n11 \nthe camera angle or when the film starts, interpretation can be reversed. For example, during \nour conversations about activity recording with British police, one officer stated that one time \nhis attempt to help a very agitated drunk person was mistaken for an aggression, based on a \nvideo-tape made by a witness; hence he was put into serious trouble. Fortunately an automatic \nsurveillance video-camera on a pole had captured the whole scene from the beginning and \nfrom another angle, which enabled to prove the witness\u2019 interpretation was wrong, and saved \nthe policeman\u2019s day.  \n \nAnother problematic issue is the very design of the human body, and its lack of transparency. \nHuman bodies are designed to ensure best vision of own action to the subject herself. The \nmanipulation zone is a small volume situated directly in front of the subject, by nature within \narm\u2019s reach. Unfortunately, this means that most of what the subject does, as seen from the \nexternal observer, is hidden by the subject\u2019s body, or from the wrong perspective. For \nexample, in the study of office work, it is difficult to catch what a subject reads or what he \ntypes on his keyboard. More generally, gesture must be guided by minute details of the \nsituation seen from the right perspective. Try to open an oyster with only the vision given by a \ncamera located a few meters away and you will see what I mean. \nIn fact, the subject is the best film director, since where she directs her senses are probably to \nthe most relevant aspects of the situation for her. A solution is therefore to have the recording \nfocus oriented by the subject herself. But the device should not get in the way of activity, it \nshould not need any specific action on the part of the subject (e.g. require the subject to use \nher hands). The system should also capture a large enough array of the visual field to include \nperipheral attention, and record sound, in stereo, with good quality (as experts know, \ncapturing image is easy, while sound is more difficult).  \n \nTo sum up, experience should be recorded as it emerges on the fly, in the flow of actual \nactivity, and from the very perspective of the actor. This is easier said than done. For \nexample, as we discovered through experiment, filming from the exact level of the eye \nproduces a different effect than from a camera attached to the forehead. The latter, although \nalready a major progress (Omodei and McLennan 1994; Omodei, Wearing and McLennan \n1997) provides the perspective of someone slightly taller, does not match exactly with the \nsubject\u2019s own perception, and does not frame well objects manipulated close. Alignments and \nocclusions are not rendered correctly, neither is eye contact; and the respective height of \nsubjects, which is an important factor in interpersonal relations, is lost. Therefore the capture \ndevice must be as close as possible to the human sensors: camera at eye level, and \nmicrophones at the ear. \n \n \n \n12 \nThis is precisely what the subcam technique was designed for (Lahlou 1999, 2006; Le Bellu, \nLahlou and Nosulenko 2010). The subcam is a miniature wide-angle video-camera with a \nstereo microphone worn on a pair of glasses, or other form factors depending on the activity \n(e.g. attached to a helmet for industrial activity, on a bandana for children, etc.). The field is \nwide enough to include the hands and the manipulation space. The mike\u2019s adaptable dynamics \nhave been designed to capture the subject\u2019s voice as well as context sources. We hand this \nwearable tool to the subject and simply ask her to perform the activity. Sound is captured at \near level \u2013but we still struggle with binaural microphones. Similar systems have been \nindependently invented in various places, the closest of ours to our knowledge being the \nsystems developed at La Trobe (Omodei and McLennan 1994; Omodei, McLennan and \nWearing 2005; Omodei, Wearing and McLennan 1997) and the first, in 1980, being Steve \nMann\u2019s pioneering wearable computing devices later used for life-logging (Mann 1998). \n \n   \n \nFigure 1a&b: same scene captured from a classic camera (left) and from a subcam worn \nby the subject (right). \n \nBy naturally orienting her attention in the course of natural activity, the subject, without any \neffort or extra attention load, enables the subcam to capture what she considers relevant, in its \ncontext. \nThe first question that scientists ask about the device is does it introduce biases? The answer \nis, yes it does; but they are minor compared to most techniques, and in many cases can be \nsuppressed or corrected with a proper protocol and form factor. Limitations will be described \nextensively in section 7. \n \n \n13 \n3.2. Attentional focus and episodic memory in sense-making processes \n3.2.1. Focus and blindness \nThe subcam, as we have seen, solves most issues with getting a situated record of auditory \nand visual array. But while the orientation of the subject\u2019s sensing in a specific direction is \neasy to render with mechanical sensors (e.g. directional microphone), it is less easy to account \nfor the interpretive selection mechanism operated by the mind on the data (e.g. the capacity to \ntune-in to a specific conversation in the noisy environment of a cocktail party). The best \naccess we can have at this point seems to be to ask the subjects what their interpretations \nwere. The subjects are not asked to produce theory, but simply to try to remember and explain \nwhy they acted so, grounded in the empirical evidence provided by the subfilms. \nIndeed, having an object in our field of vision or audition does not necessarily entail that we \nconsciously perceive it. Perception is an activity. It results from an exploratory action with the \nsensory organs (Gibson 1966; Lenay 2008; Leont'ev 1976) and cannot be separated from \ninterpretation (Von Uexk\u00fcll 1965). Attention is the behaviour by which we orient our sensory \nsystems to the environment; in doing so, we select some specific aspects and oversee the rest. \nMany psychological experiments on the \u2018priming\u2019 effect (where the attention of the subject is \nselectively tuned to some aspects by providing her some cues prior to the stimuli) show how \npowerful this selection is. One can be in a situation and remain completely unaware of the \naspects to which one is not \u2018paying attention\u2019 to. Studies on \u2018inattentional blindness\u2019 (Mack \nand Rock 1988) have shown that unexpected objects are not always \u2018seen\u2019. A classic example \nin psychology is the film featuring two basketball teams, one dressed in black and the other in \nwhite (Simons and Chabris 1999)The viewers are asked to count the passes of the ball within \nthe white team. Half way through the film, a man dressed as a black Gorilla ostensibly walks \namong the players, beats his chest in a typical Gorilla manner, and leaves. Half of the subjects \ndo not notice this unexpected Gorilla because their attention is focussed on the white players. \nThe \u2018cocktail effect\u2019 is another example, where we are able to listen to someone in a noisy \nenvironment, and sort out his very speech out of the noise. \nNevertheless, we may be influenced by subliminal perceptions, and peripheral attention is \nprecisely a mechanism that extracts some relevant features in the context out of our initial \nfocus of attention. Therefore, \u2018what\u2019 the subject actually perceives is not always obvious from \nthe recordings alone. This is why we get this information from the subjects themselves in \nconfrontation interviews. \n \n \n14 \n3.2.2. The confrontation interview \nThe only feeling that anyone can have about an event he does not experience is the \nfeeling aroused by his mental image of that event. That is why until we know what \nothers think they know, we cannot truly understand their acts. I have seen a young girl, \nbrought up in a Pennsylvania mining town, plunged suddenly from entire cheerfulness \ninto a paroxysm of grief when a gust of wind cracked the kitchen window-pane. For \nhours she was inconsolable, and to me incomprehensible. But when she was able to talk, \nit transpired that if a window-pane broke it meant that a close relative had died. \n(Gorman, Clayton, Rice-Lively and Gorman 1997: 3) \nSo, how do we access the subject\u2019s own interpretation? In SEBE we confront the subject with \nthe recorded scene and explore it together. In these sessions, the subject watches the film with \nthe researcher, and comments, frame by frame if necessary, the scene and his own \ninterpretation.  \nGreeno makes the distinction between situative approaches that use records of interaction \n(Greeno 2006) as opposed to verbal reports \u2013 such as thinking-aloud protocols (Newell and \nSimon 1972) \u2013 used in cognitive approaches. Such confrontation interviews, --- where the \nsubject is confronted with some empirical evidence --- are classic in ergonomics, and different \nvariants have been described: self-confrontational interview technique (Von Cranach and \nKalbermatten 1982), self-confrontation (Theureau, 1992), crossed self-confrontation (Clot, \nFa\u00efta, Fernandez, and Scheller, 2001; Clot, 1999), explicitation interviewing (Vermersch, \n1994), cued recall debrief (Omodei, Wearing and McLennan 2002), etc. Other techniques \nusing verbal protocols to describe the same, but without direct confrontation with the \nrecordings, have also been used with some success; e.g. instructions to an alter-ego (Oddone, \nRe and Briante 1981) where the subject is supposed to describe the activity to a learner, or \nreasoning out loud (Bisseret, Sebillotte, and Falzon, 1999). While some authors claim that \ntheir own technique is very specific (e.g. Rix and Biache, 2004 and their \u2018subjective re-situ\u2019 \ninterviews), the idea remains the same: to use some \u2018stimulated recall\u2019 (Lyle 2003) to obtain \nan explicitation by the subject of the mental events underlying the activity, based on using the \navailable elements, usually film or subfilm.  \nDepending on the specific goals of the research, the nature of the prompts given by the \nresearcher to the subject may vary. Other elements than the film may be added (for example \nwe also use the formal rules or descriptions of procedures, or other subject\u2019s films to compare \nwith, etc.) We may focus on goals, tasks and affordances when detailing professional activity \nin the perspective of constructing training films; while for the same activity we may focus on \nemotions, desires, and \u2018problems\u2019 when we are interested in re-designing the installation for \nmore fluid usability etc. Furthermore, other parameters will play: the nature of the activity, the \ndegree of knowledge of the researcher and his proximity with the subject.  \n \n \n15 \nThe risk here is to fetishize the method, by focusing on the device (the subcam) or on some \nrigid confrontation method for the interview. The research techniques are not goals per se, but \nmerely an instrument to the research itself. The reader will adapt the techniques to their own \nresearch problem. \n \nAnother difficult issue is that mental activity is not a straightforward single narrative where \nthe subject would be consciously monitoring one single track of action (I am doing this then \nthis then that\u2026) but rather multitasking and running multiple processes in parallel (Lahlou \n2000), of which only some come in the focus of consciousness, especially when a decision is \nneeded. Understanding activity needs \u2018peeling off\u2019 these different layers of simultaneous \nprocesses; which have their own logic. Therefore, forcing explicit description of activity into \nthe description into a single course of action would not only be incomplete: it simply does not \nrender the very nature of the processes (cf. Infra, Section 5). The interviewer must remain \ncareful in the search of explicitation: he should not aim systematically for a single, coherent \nand non-contradictory account of what happened. Real action is often ambiguous and may \nhave multiple determinations. Beware of Damastism. \nAnyway, human memory seems to be closely linked with the perception of place and action, a \nproperty that the ancient arts of memory have discovered very early, by training orators to \nremember their speeches by associating the various items to objects in a familiar place, as an \nimagined trajectory in this place. Maybe the following has already happened to the reader: at \nhome having entered a room he realizes he has forgotten what he was looking for. Walking \nback to where he started from, and entering the room again, memory of intention suddenly \ncomes back. This is the effect that the subcamer often experiences when viewing his own \nsubfilms: he is put back on track to comment actual activity. This helps the subject recover \nand make explicit her goals in the confrontation interview. And indeed goals are crucial to \nunderstanding activity, as the next section will develop. \n3.3. Goals \n3.3.1. The \u2018why\u2019 issue \nThe activity of Humans, as of most animals with a brain, is oriented by some purpose. If this \npurpose is not part of the description, we may completely lose the meaning of the activity. Let \nus quote the following example by ethologist Jacques Vauclair: \n \nSuppose you walk along the road and that at some point you see 50 meters ahead a \npigeon which takes off and flies to a tree 50 meters on your right.  \n \n \n16 \nThe empirical description will be: \n- rapid and alternate contraction and relaxation of pectoral muscles \n- flapping wings \n- flight \nFunctional description will consist simply in saying that the pigeon fled by flying away. \n(Vauclair 1984, my translation) \n \nAs we see, knowing goals and motives considerably simplifies the description, which is great \nnews because detailed analysis of videos can be pretty cumbersome. \nWhile Sch\u00fctz is quite right that the scientist should not limit herself to what the subject says \n(Sch\u00fctz 1964), this part is still essential to understand what is at stake, and what are the values \nof the stakes; and in fact later in the same paper, Sch\u00fctz writes, commenting on the example \nof a businessman who runs to catch the same train he takes every morning, in order, that \nspecific day, not to lose an important contract:  \nLet us assume that an observer watches this man rushing for the train \u2018as usual\u2019 (so he \nthinks). Is this behaviour planned, and if so, what is the plan? Only the actor can give \nthe answer because he alone knows the span of his plans and projects (Sch\u00fctz 1964, p. \n76) \nActivity theory (B\u00f6dker 1989, 1991; Engestr\u00f6m 1990; Engestr\u00f6m and Middleton 1998; \nGinsburg, Brenner and Von Cranach 1985; Leont'ev 1974, 1981; Nardi 1996; Nosulenko and \nRabardel 2007; Rubinstein 1997; Von Cranach, M\u00e4chler and Steiner 1985) precisely takes \nthis purposefulness as a fundamental feature to describe activity. In a nutshell, in activity the \norganism strives to reach its goals in the conditions given by the environment; goals are \nconscious representations of desired states; goals are specific ways of fulfilling motives. \nMotives are the subjective perception of its needs by the subject (hunger, security etc.)  \nMotives and goals are rather general levels of determination. In practice, to reach the \ngoal the subject will have to create a trajectory from current state (conditions given) to \ndesired state (the goal). To do so the subject goes through steps (\u2018tasks\u2019); each one \nhaving its own aim (sub-goal). For example, to operate an electric valve, the subject \nmay have to first check actual state of valve and compare with expected state as given \nby his instruction sheet, connect the motor of the valve to the mains, operate the \ncontrols, check the valve has attained desired value, report, consignate valve, disconnect \nfrom mains. And each task may break into subtasks (e.g. checking state of valve starts \nby checking one is in front of the right valve by checking valve reference number).  \nExecution of some tasks might reveal problems, and need conscious monitoring of \nmotor and mental actions by the subject; while for some others a routine sequence of \nautomatic actions is sufficient. When actions are automatic and are applied beyond \n \n \n17 \nconscious control (e.g. changing gear when driving a car, turning on the cooker, typing \na password, etc.) they are called \u2018operations\u2019.  \nSo activity appears as an oriented trajectory from a given state (\u2018conditions given\u2019) to a \nconsciously represented expected state (\u2018goal\u2019). Attaining the goal satisfies the motives \nof the subject. The trajectory of activity is a succession of small problems to be solved \n(\u2018tasks\u2019), which can each be seen as reaching a local subgoal. The operator solves each \ntask by taking actions (consciously controlled motor or mental moves) and operations \n(automatic, routinized moves taking place beyond threshold of consciousness). At each \nmoment, the subject is confronted to the possibility of taking a different local route to \nreach the final trajectory, and may do so opportunistically in consideration of the local \nconditions given at this point.(Lahlou 2011, italics in original)  \nUsing Russian activity theory combined with SEBE makes it amazingly simpler to describe \nactivity. One of the crucial advantages is that activity theory provides a natural breakdown of \nthe activity flow in sequences (task, sub-task, and finally operations) with their goals and sub-\ngoals. Using this technique considerably reduces the process of coding, and suppresses a \nproblem that kept us blocked for years (when coding video, how do we cut it into elementary \nunits?) \n \nIn sum, if we want to get a full understanding of activity, we must know the motives and \ngoals of the subject. As these are internal to the subject, the easiest way is to get the subject to \nmake them explicit. Such endeavour is one of the purposes of the confrontation interview \n(another being to make the description transferrable in etic terms). \n3.3.2. Empowering the subject to explain \nUnfortunately, subjects may not always be conscious of their internal states and goals; they \nmay not want to express them to the researcher; even when they are willing and conscious \nthey may not be able to verbalize. Furthermore, as the human machine is designed for \nattentional economy, most of what we can do without cluttering our limited attention and \nconsciousness span is done automatically (that is: often below conscious threshold), and not \nstored in explicit memory. So we tend to forget these transient states, or at least have great \ndifficulty to recall them from memory only. This is why every description ex post is \nnecessarily some kind of reconstruction by the subject: a reconstruction done in the Damastic \nframework of the culture, representations and other experiences of the subject. One classic \nexample of this problem is the inconsistency of accounts of the \u2018same\u2019 event by different \neyewitnesses (Read 2001). This is why it is so crucial that the interpretation be made in a \ncontext as close as possible of the actual events in order to have the reconstruction based on \nactual context elements (\u2018evidence-based\u2019). \nIt is also crucial that the researcher helps the subject to explain, as the latter may not be \n \n \n18 \nfamiliar or able to introspection and the process of untangling the motives. The general idea is \nto put the subject into a \u2018reflexive mod\u2019 where she is comfortable and fully willing to \nelucidate the various layers of internal goals and motives, and also external elements or \nevents, which caused the observed behaviour. \n \nWhile we have not found another technique than trust building with the subject to deal with \nthe cases where the subject would not want to share his goals with the researcher, the other \ncases (subconscious processes, difficulties of expression) are usually dealt with by the \nconfrontation phase. In most cases, the subject is able to recover the memory of his goals as \nhe views his own activity on the subcam film. In many a case, the way the subject expresses \nhis goals, by finger pointing at elements of the contexts, explains why it would be very \ndifficult to do so without the context being visible in self-entheaty, because many details of \nthe activity are in practice context-driven. For example \u2018Here I want to grab the keyboard, but \nbecause I am afraid the mouse that is attached will fall there, I have to open the drawer first, \nso I must pull the chair back\u2019. Or \u2018You see the way she looks at me? Then I understand I \nshould not have told her and I feel really bad. Then I must explain, because, that Patrick was \nnot there when this happened\u2019.  \n \nTherefore, our technique aims at collecting the motives, goals and sub-goals of the subject \nduring the confrontation interview. This also enables to gather the relevant dimensions of the \nphenomena from the perspective of the subject, their \u2018perceived quality\u2019  (Nosulenko 2008; \nNosulenko, Parizet and Samoylenko 1998; Nosulenko and Samoylenko 1997, 2009a; \nNosulenko, Samoylenko and McAdams 1994). Nevertheless, the process of recovery, to be \nefficient, needs in our experience a much more active role from the researcher than classic \nsemi-directive interviewing, the collection of life stories, or critical incident technique. How \nwe proceed is detailed in section 4.5. \nIt is also to be noted that this technique enables the explicitation of many aspects of what has \nbeen called \u2018tacit\u2019 knowledge in the knowledge management literature (Nonaka and Takeuchi \n1995; Polanyi 1958, 1967), that is knowledge that was not expressed verbally by the experts. \nOur experiments in transferring professional knowledge among the operators of nuclear plants \nwere a good surprise in this respect (Le Bellu, Lahlou and Le Blanc 2009; Le Bellu, Lahlou \nand Nosulenko 2010). \n3.4. Detailed description and its construction from the emic and etic perspectives \nAll analysts are prone to Damastism. Insiders and outsiders exhibit different biases. Observers \nfrom outside the community tend to have an ignorance bias and fail to capture elements that \nare critical to understanding the situation, while inside observers tend to ignore elements that \n \n \n19 \nare inconsistent with the image they want to have of their community. This is why it is better \nwhere possible to cross the eyes of an insider and an outsider(Cicourel and Lahlou 2005). The \nconfrontation interview precisely allows this triangulation. \nIt is worth noting that, as explanation is an abductive process, the discussion with the subject \nis necessary to produce an etic description which the subject also considers valid. Sometimes \nthe subject is fully able to express spontaneously all necessary elements, but this is the \nexception. Because many elements seem obvious to the subject, she will not spontaneously \nverbalize them. This is because in conversation what is obvious is not supposed to be \nverbalized - this is one of Gricean conversational maxims, the maxim of quantity (Grice, \n1979). This is also why what the subject says depends upon what the subject thinks the \nresearcher needs. \nSometimes, the subject does not have the words, sometimes why she acted so is not obvious \neven to herself and a more detailed investigation is necessary. In this collaborative process, an \nexplanation that is understandable, consistent, and \u2018valid\u2019 from the emic perspective of the \nsubject, is constructed.  \nThis part of the technique is probably the most revolutionary in terms of emic\/etic. It \ndemonstrates that we can go beyond the classic divide between observer and observee and \nconstruct, in a collaborative investigation, an interpretation that is a proper translation of the \nsubject\u2019s experience in understandable terms. Here is an extract of a confrontation interview \nwith an expert of the LSE \u2018laptop surgery\u2019 where he comments the subfilm where he solved a \ndifficult case. The laptop surgery is a place where students can bring their laptop and get it \nfixed. In this particular case, the student\u2019s PC screen would \u2018freeze\u2019 inexplicably. In this \nextract, the researcher tries to validate his interpretation of the expert\u2019s strategy for problem \nsolving, and tries to find the right terms with the subject, as they just watched and discussed \nan extract of his subfilm.  \nNote how the subcamer and the interviewer are both in \u2018reflexive mode\u2019 (frequent use of \nahmm, ehm, hesitations); and how the subcamer, remarkably didactic, constantly checks the \ninterviewer follows and understands what he says in emic mode (very frequent use of \u2018you \nknow\u2019, an expression this subject almost never uses in the verbal interactions with the users \nwhose laptops he fixes). \nSubcamer: But that\u2019s a very unusual case I mean. With most of, stuff, you know, ahmm \nit\u2019s a pretty automated process, I could give somebody a piece of paper and they could \nfollow the process and get rid of like 90% of this stuff. Hm. This was a particularly \nawkward one.  \nResearcher: It\u2019s interesting, because you had to display hmm a lot of strategy.  \nSubcamer: Yeah, well more than anything you know you\u2019ve got to show a bit of \ninitiative as well, ahm, and, you know often you\u2019d start going on Google or something \nlike that to find the answers and\u2026 You know with a lot of problem solving with \n \n \n20 \ncomputers, you know, probably like, I\u2019d say, may be 50% of it is prior knowledge and \nthen 50% of it is knowing where to go to find the answers. You know. \nResearcher: I see \nSubcamer: Like here, you know, with the guys that work here [they are expected to] to \nknow to find the answers. Hmm. You know. That, that\u2019s, You know, I joke with my \nMom about it. My Mom will say \u2018Well how do I fix it?\u2019 So   I say \u2018Google it!\u2019 You \nknow, because that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do, y\u2019know [laughs]. You know. That, that\u2019s how \nyou fix lot of these problems.  \nResearcher: So, so, there\u2019s a moment when, ehm, just ehm. Well. It\u2019s like first you, you \nthought that could be a, you saw very quickly that was not a classic case, right, because \nthe guy  [already  \nSubcamer:  [yeah \nResearcher: had taken the virus  [away \nSubcamer:  [yeah \nResearcher: which means that he he\u2019s computer literate also \nSubcamer: Yeah, exactly. He\u2019d, he\u2019d actually done, you know, probably the first two \nsteps that we would have done here, so we were already at an advanced ... place \nResearcher: All right. So then you check that he did right \nSubcamer: Exactly \nResearcher: And then you realize that this is gonna be a tougher case than expected? \nSubcamer:  Yeah \nResearcher: And, ehm, did, did, did that prompt you into some different kind of \u2018expert \nmode\u2019 or? \nSubcamer: Ahmm, I don\u2019t know really? I don\u2019t really know what that means.  \nResearcher: Ehm, I, I, I don\u2019t know either. I, [I mean \nSubcamer:  [I mean I, I guess \nResearcher: Firstly, If you get a change in your [gestures],  [your mood \nSubcamer: [Yeah, yeah.   \nI know what you\u2019re saying. So it\u2019s basically like, with a lot of things here, with viruses; \nyou know here we get lots of viruses it\u2019s a repetitive task  [so \n[they both move position on their seats and make hands gestures] \nResearcher:  [Right. So you  \nhave an auto, automatic  [eh \nSubcamer:  [Yeah, we have a process that we follow, you know, to \n(attain ?) we will follow that same process, ahm, and he\u2019d gone half way that process \nalready so. So you\u2019re right, yeah, I checked the, the process that he\u2019d followed would be \nthe same process that I would do, amh, and then, yeah, I guess, you know at that point it \nends you start to get more creative in, in your thinking. Yeah. \n \nIn this case, the subcamer makes explicit, in his own words, the procedural rationality that \nbeen described by classic literature on human problem solving. Interestingly, although this \nprocess is collectively shared by the team\u2019s experts, it not an explicit reference procedure in \n \n \n21 \nthe surgery, but could be (\u2018I could give somebody a piece of paper and they could follow the \nprocess and get rid of like 90% of this stuff\u2019).  \n \nThe subcam provides material that is especially relevant for the reconstruction of the mental \nactivity. Experience shows that subjects are able, even weeks after the fact, to recall very \nprecisely the situation. We can check whether this is not a reconstruction by asking the \nsubject \u2018what will happen next\u2019, and then compare with the actual action on film. \nThis recall effect is probably due to the nature of episodic memory(Tulving 1972, 2002). \nWhile semantic memory recalls general relations between objects, episodic memory is a \nmultimodal association connected to an actual lived event (time, place, associated emotions, \nintentions, contextual knowledge and other associations) which come back as a bundle when \nthe subject recalls the event. At the view of his own film, when put back into an exact \nperspective of the actually lived sequence, the subject is naturally induced to recall this \nsequence. Getting multimodal cues allows much better recovery of events experienced (ref. \nMarcel Proust's madeleine episode, or emotions relived by returning to the scene of an event). \nAt this stage it is possible to have access to thoughts and emotions of the subject (Bentley, \nJohnston and Baggo 2005) even months later \u2013 a delay often needed for the analysis and \nfinding an appointment with the subject. Such an effect is observed with classic film \nrecording, but not to the same degree as with the subcam. The neurophysiological \nmechanisms behind this interesting phenomenon are yet to be discovered. It is possible that \nthe mirror neuron system (Gallese, Fadiga, Fogassi and Rizzolatti 1996; Rizzolatti and \nCraighero 2004; Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Fogassi and Gallese 1996) is involved, but this is only a \nhypothesis. \nWhile discussing the interpretation with the subject is not new, we found that adopting an \n\u201cevidence-based\u201d approach,  by discussing a material that strongly supports recall of \nsubjective states (intentions, emotions\u2026) brought ground-breaking progress to our research. \nOne fascinating but embarrassing fact is that often our previous own explanations based on \nviewing the film without the subject, although plausible, were denied by the subject who \nfostered quite different, and obviously \u2018true\u2019 interpretations. We should highlight here that, \nnow that we have practiced this for a while without major difficulties, we find it surprising \nthat most of the time research in social science does not even care to check its interpretations \nwith the subjects themselves. \n3.5. Presentation and transfer \nWe need not insist here on the advantages of using the film for presenting the phenomena and \nthe results themselves, instead of a transcript. We believe that some years from now the film \nwill become a primary publication media, and gradually replace text in the presentation of \n \n \n22 \nempirical material in scientific journals. \nAs a preview to this yet to come era, this paper is linked with presentations of subcam films, \navailable at: http:\/\/www.psych.lse.ac.uk\/socialPsychology\/faculty\/saadi_lahlou\/subcam-films \n \nNevertheless, the presentation formats combining video and commentary are still in infancy. \nFurther research is needed in this domain.  \n4. Equipment and protocols \nHowever exciting SEBE may appear, it would be foolish to think that buying some off-the-\nshelf head mounted camera designed for sports will do the trick, as some colleagues naively \nhoped. Just as it takes more than a tape recorder to make good ethnography, it takes more than \na head-mounted camera to do proper SEBE. The most important element of the whole method \nis building trust with the subjects, and in practice the devices and method to create a good \nenvironment for SEBE research are unfortunately heavy. They need careful preparation and \noften the help of several researchers on the field. \n4.1. Equipment \n4.1.1. Capture : the subcam \nThe device should be portable and light enough not to change the behaviour observed.  \nOur first subcams date back to the 1990\u2019s when video equipment was still using tapes, was \nenergy greedy and was not as small as today (Lahlou 1998, 1999). We were forced to design \nit and then have it build from scratch. The first prototype was built by the French company \nGenitech and operational in 1997. Now, although we still cannot find what we need off the \nshelf, subcams are easily assembled from cheap components available to any laboratory. In a \ndozen years, cost dropped by a factor 50, size and weight by 15, while resolution and \nautonomy grew by a factor 4. This trend will continue. The current versions (except the very \nhigh resolution one which was custom made in a small series and can record enough detail to \nread details and text) are made of a small recorder, about the size of a mobile phone (Figure \n3), a very small camera (about 1 cm) which we attach to glasses or a to bandana (Figure 2), \nand a microphone a few millimetres in size. \n \n \n23 \n \n  \n \nFigure 2 : subject wearing a subcam (\u2018light\u2019 version, 2010): the camera is attached to the \nsubject\u2019s own glasses (small black cylinder). Wire goes behind ear to wearable recorder \n \n \n \nFigure 3 : Subcam, 2010 version, the recorder (carried in a pocket or clipped to belt). \nWire goes to camera head. \n \nSubcam-like devices are now employed more and more. Often integrated into a helmet, they \nare used in sports such as bike racing, skiing, hunting etc. Subcams are also used by \nemergency response services, the police and the army. The pioneer of wearable cameras, \nSteve Mann, advocated the use of first person recording to develop \u2018sous-veillance\u2019, a \n \n \n24 \ncitizen\u2019s answer to digital surveillance, by authorities. With such recordings, the individual \ncould document his own perspective and challenge the authority\u2019s recordings (Ganascia 2010; \nMann 1998, 2004; Mann, Nolan and Wellman 2003). Some of his predictions start to realize: \nalready individuals use them on a daily basis, as this British cyclist who used one to document \nan accident with a van (Aldridge-Neil 2011). \nIn feature movie production subjective perspectives has often been used, sometimes \nsystematically: see Being John Malkovich, REC, Das Szenario (a marketing event by Cortal \nConsors Germany where subcams where used in a popular \u2018experiment\u2019 to communicate the \nexperience of participants to a wider audience). But subjective view in cinema is very \ndifferent from what appears on subcam films (see infra, section 5). \n \nHere is how to make a subcam for research purposes, to study human activity, from off-the-\nshelf components. The camera should be very small, and the recorder as well. The angle of \nview must cover the manipulation area. The camera must be equipped with a wide angle lens \n(about 115 degrees of field coverage), which captures the hands in the record field. This can \nbe obtained with add-on lenses because small cameras often do not have wide-angle.  \nAs the camera should be mounted at eye level, subjects who already wear glasses (and they \nare many, especially after the age of 45) are a problem. We make custom attachments in such \ncases (Figure 5). \nIt is also important to have good stereo sound, and one issue is to have a dynamic range that \nenables capturing both distant voices and the subject\u2019s voice, but not saturate in noisy \nenvironments such as the street. This forced us to develop specific additional hardware and \nfirmware to adapt off-the-shelf equipment. Ideally we need binaural microphones (one in each \near) to capture directional sound, and phone conversations. Otherwise, simply using a small \ndigital recorder in the subject\u2019s pocket and dubbing it to the video can do.  \nBecause we capture sound on the subject\u2019s body, voice and other body sounds (like breathing) \nare of better quality and higher volume compared to physical sounds (object manipulation). \nThis gives us clues about the subject's emotional state: breathing, hoarseness, throat clearing, \ngrunting, primary vocalization, etc. We can detect, for example, during a discussion, the times \nwhen the subject seeks to utter without necessarily succeeding, by hearing the primers (\u2018Er..\u2019 \n\u2018I..\u2019). \nThe longer the autonomy the better. We can record many hours of video without changing the \nmemory card (a whole day if necessary); but we are currently limited to about 3.5 hours of \nbattery life. One full day autonomy is the target.  \nFor very young children and animals, we can use a version with a radio transmitter, where the \nrecording is done on a remote VCR. This equipment is small and light (Figure 4), but we do \nnot use it for adults because we prefer the subject to be in full control of the recording at all \n \n \n25 \ntimes, to build trust (cf. Infra, sections 4.4 and 7.1); also the wearable recorder provides better \nimage quality. The technology changes so fast that there are many custom-made versions in \nvarious labs, based on different components. Over the years we have used more than 10 \nversions. Decent results can be obtained in many cases with rather primitive equipment, but \nspecific research where one need to read details and have high quality sound can be \ntechnically challenging. \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Child wearing our lightweight wireless subcam on a bandana \n \nIn conclusion, two important things to keep in mind with subcams: \na) the device must have wide-angle, good sound, reliability and be very easy to use by the \nsubject. Off-the-shelf devices, like the ones made for sports, are usually not adequate: actual \nuse on the field reveals that devil is in the detail, for example equipment must be easy to \nattach to people who do not wear belts or helmets. \nb) the capture device is necessary, but not enough. The protocol is very important, and is the \nmost difficult part of the technique. \n4.2. The protocol \nThis paper presents the current state of our protocols for data collection and methods of \nanalysis based on a dozen years of experience which provided hundreds of hours of films. \nNevertheless, the method is still in infancy and the protocols will evolve. We trust the readers \nwill adapt them to their specific needs. \nFor the sake of clarity, we call here, respectively, \u2018subcamer\u2019 the subject who wears the \n \n \n26 \nsubcam, \u2018colleagues\u2019 other members of his community where data are collected, \u2018cast\u2019 \npersons appearing on the film, \u2018researchers\u2019 those conducting the experiment. In general we \nshall call \u2018participants\u2019 all of the above except the passers-by who are hardly recognizable on \nthe recordings. \n4.3. Preparation \nThe nature of subjects and length of observation are selected according to the research \nproblem (usually a few hours recording or less).  \nIt is wise to pay a preliminary visit to the environment where the subcam will be used. \nRecruitment is not just about the subcamer, but also about his environment (colleagues, cast). \nWe must ensure that such recruitment is complete and has informed consent of all participants \nand stakeholders (e.g. the hierarchy in organizations, owners of the setting, parents or \ncaretakers of subjects etc.) The protocol is explained to participants, they are introduced to the \ndevice, shown films, explained the purpose of research, and given the subcam for a test on \ntheir own. \nIf some people do not want to appear on film, adequate measures must be taken to take their \nwish into account. It must be made clear, and in writing, that no image will be used without \nprevious written consent of people who appear on film. In some cases where it is not possible \nto avoid capturing some passers-by, face blurring is an option. It would be too long to \ndescribe in detail the process by which we ensure all this, but be aware that in public spaces \nthis is a painstaking task that requires preparation, e.g. with preparing informed consent \nforms, setting logistics to give participants access to the recordings, keeping track of \naddresses and consents, etc. This is why the method is easier to apply in a closed environment \nwhere subjects can be traced. \nFor subjects who already wear glasses, we make a special attachment that enables the camera \nto be tied to their own glasses (Figure 5). This takes about an hour in our workshop. We take \npictures of the subjects\u2019 glasses so the attachment can be made offline between first contact \nand collection day.  \nPeople with standard eye correction can use one of our special set of glasses with attachments. \n \n \n \n27 \n \n \nFigure 5: Subcam attachment to glasses. Left the camera head, right the subject\u2019s \nglasses with the attachment clipped to them. The camera head clips into the cylinder. \n \nA preliminary interview with the subject enables to better understand the context. The first \nvisit will also help spotting potential issues, especially with colleagues and cast. Preparation \ndoes not remove all the reactions of surprise and jokes by colleagues to the subcamer, but it \ndoes reduce them significantly. The ideal case is of repeated capture sessions, which enable \nall participants to get used to the device and not pay attention to it any more. Keep in mind \nthat the cooperation of all participants will be necessary in the analysis process, and for \npublication. Informed consent of all individuals on the films should be done before or just \nafter recording, and track kept of who is actually visible on the films. This is easier if the issue \nhas been addressed well in advance. \nExperience shows that difficulties arise less with the subcamers themselves than with other \nparticipants: as he wears the camera, the subcamer feels in a psychological position on the \nside of the researchers. Also, the subcamer usually benefitted from more attention from the \nresearchers, and is taken into an involvement process that results into compliance and \nmotivated participation (Joule and Beauvois 1998; Mayo 1949). \nOne might be tempted to use \u2018spy\u2019 recording devices. We are opposed to the practice of \nrecording unaware subjects. This is not only unethical but short sighted since it is trust and \ncooperation of the participants that make the method so productive. The protocol aims to \nbuild trust through concrete measures and strict ethics. It is in the best interest of the \nresearcher to earn that trust by being the guardian of the \u2018face\u2019 of subcamers. One need \nsympathy and care for the subject. Only at the cost of a constant endeavour of responsibility \nvis-\u00e0-vis the participants can one get access to their experience. The principle that should \n \n \n28 \nguide the researcher is to avoid at all costs the possibility of an incident, even if it means \nsacrificing data collection.  \n4.4. Collection phase  \nOn the day planned for recording, one or two experimenters, of whom one at least is already \nknown by the subcamer, come to equip the subject. One should stick around to help the \nsubcamer to change memory\/batteries and to solve any arising issue, technical or social. It \nalso makes the subcamer\u2019s life easy: if a participant wants more explanations about the \nprocess, the researcher can do this off-line while the subcamer remains undisturbed. It should \nbe clear to the subcamer and his colleagues that stopping the recording is a benign act, which \nwill not be taken badly by the researcher. This helps all participants feel comfortable and in \ncontrol. And indeed, if the subject chooses to delete the record of the day this is no big deal: \nthis session may be replaced by another later.  \nThe subcamers are instructed to go about their activity \u2018as usual\u2019. As this may be disturbing \nfor the subject --- \u2018be-natural\u2019 being a paradoxical injunction (Sluzki and Veron 1981) - the \nsubject also receives technical instructions. These instructions focus on technical aspects: the \nsubcamer must stop recording when going to the bathroom, if he feels that one of the \ncolleagues is embarrassed, etc. \nThe adjustment of the subcam, especially for those already wearing glasses, takes several \nminutes. It is somewhat similar to a session at the tailors\u2019 or the radiologist and may cause the \nsame type of discomfort in the subcamer, because the experimenter is quite close and must \ntouch the body of the subcamer to fix the recorder and adjust the wire and the camera angle. \nThe researcher must announce and explain aloud her manipulations. \nDuring recording, the researcher takes note of all incidents. Immediately afterwards, she holds \na quick debriefing. There she seeks the subject\u2019s feedback to assess whether the behaviour \nwas biased by wearing the subcam; and if so where and why. \nIn the general opinion of users, the subcam is forgotten after a few minutes and their \nbehaviour was spontaneous, except for brief episodes where they paid more attention to what \nthey said. Anyway, as the subjects are taken in the flow of real action, they are in some way \ninduced by the context to behave \u2018normally\u2019 in order to reach their goals. Biases when they \noccur do so in interaction with fellow humans, not with objects.  \nAfter debriefing the subcamer keeps all records and equipment for a few days, with \ninstructions to watch them, to make sure he is comfortable with researchers watching it, and \notherwise destroy any or all of the data, with no questions asked if he decides to do so. As the \nrecorder automatically breaks down the recording into 15mn files which can be read on any \ncomputer, erasing a part of the recording is easy even for people with very limited technical \nskills. \n \n \n29 \nAnother reason for our protocol is to constantly make the researchers aware of the subject\u2019s \ninterest so as to avoid any blunder on their part, e.g. showing the films without consent etc. \nWe are aware this is heavy. But this is part of a philosophy of collaborating with the subjects, \nconsidering them on the same level as the researchers, and the results are worth it. It also \nmakes it a more interesting experience for the subjects, who learn about themselves. \nDebrief at the end of the recording session is an opportunity to fill a short questionnaire with \nthe subcamer and make an appointment for the confrontation interview. The timing of the \nself-confrontation must leave some space for the subject to watch the films and then for a \nshort preview of the films by researchers, where the most interesting parts will be clipped to \nbe discussed later with the subcamer. In this clipping process, researchers will make a first \ninterpretation attempt, to be confronted with the subject\u2019s own interpretation for validation or \namendment. (NB: clipping is a Damastic operation, and the researcher must be quite clear \nabout her rationale in this operation (see infra, section 4.5)).  \n \nAfter having being given the films, subcamers usually do not ask for cuts. Here is the most \nfrequent case: subcamer viewed in detail the beginning of the subfilm and found it \nfascinating; then fell on a long sequence where not much happens (e.g. doing email on \ncomputer, taking public transports, etc.); then passed into fast forward mode, possibly \nwatching a particular episode. Most have not even watched all of the films. In fact, after the \nexcitement of re-living the situation in detail, the \u2018d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2019 aspect lowers interest and the \nsubject finally realizes that the films only show mundane, everyday activity. This first \nexperience usually takes away the last reluctance to use the tool and subcamers often offer \nspontaneously to repeat the experiment if necessary. This is a good thing because usually the \nsecond take is better, all participants now having lost their initial anxiety if there were any. \nThis is also valuable because the subcamer then becomes a subcam advocate with his \ncolleagues and a potential recruiter who has best access to local participants. This is another \nreason why the subcam is  particularly well-suited to long field work. \n4.5. Analysis: confronting the subcamer with recordings \nA tremendous advantage of recorded data is that it permits repeated, detailed \nexamination of actual sequences of talk and embodied work practices in the settings \nwhere practitioners actually perform these activities (Goodwin 1994 p. 6077).  \nThe films made by the subcamer are viewed by the researcher, \u2018interesting\u2019 scenes are clipped \nand undergo an initial analysis. These clips can be a few minutes, or much more, but one \nshould be aware that long extracts may take very long to discuss, and keep in mind that the \nsubject may not always be able to stay concentrated for many hours. This is why we tend to \nclip, and focus only on scenes that are relevant to the current research. \n \n \n30 \nThe subcamer is then showed the clipped extracts and invited to comment them (self-\nconfrontation). Figure 6 shows a typical view of debrief on site. We often invite subjects to \nview the films in a specific room in our lab, on a very large screen.  \nThese sessions, in the presence of the analyst, are videotaped with an external camera, or with \na subcam worn by the subject (which is the now option we adopt usually). This way we know \nwhat the subject refers to when commenting the clip, and we can control for the influence of \nthe researcher in the confrontation interview (cf. the Damastism issue, section 1).  \nWhen extracts from the films are considered to be used for a public presentation, informed \nconsent is sought on the occasion of the confrontation interview. \n \n \n \nFigure 6 : confrontation interview. Subcamer (centre) comments subfilm (right) to \nresearcher (left) \n \nThe material selected for the analysis naturally depends on the research problem; everyone \ncan build their own strategy for selecting clips. When investigating small samples, we clip as \nwe collect the data and therefore do the confrontation interviews as just described. On larger \nsamples the strategy we use most frequently is \u2018retrospective sampling\u2019. It follows from the \ngeneral heuristic of \u2018experimental reality\u2019 in which we follow over a long period (several \nmonths up to three years), in great detail, the activity of entire groups, e.g. by accommodating \nthem in a building specially designed for observation (Lahlou 2009). This strategy is also used \nwhen we do not know exactly what is relevant ex ante, or to re-use videos from previous \n \n \n31 \ncaptures with a new perspective \u2013the latter being especially useful because it spares new data \ncollection. And more generally, it happens that we only realize after the fact what was \ninteresting to study in a situation.  \nWhen viewing the films, if an event seems particularly interesting, we develop interpretative \nassumptions. If we have a large sample we then derush other recordings from which we \nsystematically extract clips of similar situations to validate\/falsify our interpretation. We thus \nobtain a sample of natural situations where a particular type of phenomenon occurred. These \nclips are then systematically coded in detail, and hypotheses tested. For example, Cordelois, \nwhen studying the activity of \u2018returning home\u2019, noticed an interesting \u2018sigh\u2019 on one recording, \nafter the subcamer just passed his home door. He then went fishing for similar occurrences in \nall the rest of his sample to test his hypothesis. It turned out that 73% of subjects did have \nsome sort of relief or relaxation \u2018sigh\u2019 right after they had passed the door when coming home \n(Cordelois 2010). This had gone unnoticed in most cases except one in the first analysis of \ntapes; but was very significant for the analysis of what it means to \u2018come home\u2019. \nIn another instance, we extracted and analysed systematically 101 interruptions during office \nwork by a visitor or by phone, retrieved from 50 hours of subfilms (Lahlou 2000). This \nallowed us to better understand how interruption was handled by the subjects and how it \naffected their subsequent activity.  \nAnother technique is to compare the same activity in different environments (Nosulenko and \nSamoylenko 2003). For such analyses we identify the tasks, the participants, the activity \ncomponents (goals, tasks, actions and operations) and the tools that mediate them. We can \nalso compare the differences between the planned activity (as described by the subject during \na preliminary interview) and actual activity. Such comparisons are instructive regarding the \ninfluence of the environment on actual activity. In a comparison of planned and actual tasks \nby an expert (in this case, sending an email with a PDA), it was found that 7 out of the 16 \nactual subtasks were not planned, and that unplanned operations accounted for 58% of the \nactual task duration (Lahlou 2008; Lahlou, Nosulenko and Samoylenko 2002). From an \noperational design perspective, understanding these differences and reducing them by acting \non the installation improves comfort and overall efficiency in the workplace. \n \nThe subject comments as the film plays, he pauses or moves forward and backward to explain \nin more detail the reasons for his actions. This kind of comment requires the subject to \nunderstand what the researcher is after; and is more demanding than classic semi-directive \ninterview, or debriefs. This is why the first minutes are used to train the subject as the analysis \nbegins, by encouraging him in the right direction, and make him feel completely at ease and \nin control of the process. The main fear of subjects is to lose face. Therefore the researcher \nmust reassure the subject that what is being discussed is quite usual. One way we do this is \n \n \n32 \nsharing our own experience. For instance, most subjects, when commenting subfilms made at \nhome, apologize that \u2018my house is a mess\u2019. Our typical answer is \u2018You must be kidding, you \nshould see mine! It\u2019s funny, everyone says the same thing. It would be impossible to live in a \nhouse that is always perfectly ordered.\u2019  \nEspecially in the beginning of the process, the researcher must ask the subject to pause the \nvideo many times, and insist on getting a detailed account of action, in the minutest details. In \ndoing so, the researcher ventures various hypotheses and asks the subject to confirm, give \nprecision, in order to peel the various layers of goals and motives that lie behind the observed \naction. The subject must be introduced to this notion, and empowered into detailed \nintrospection.  \nAs said earlier, natural activity is about running several processes in parallel. There are \nseveral layers because, in real settings, subjects constantly pursue several goals at the same \ntime, perform sequences of tasks with diverse time horizons, switch from one to another in \norder to make the best use of resources. Subjects also actively try to avoid some unwanted \nsituations. Experts can be recognized in their capacity to take early measures avoiding \npotential problems later in the course of activity.  \nThe confrontation phase is dedicated to the peeling of the various layers in order to recover \nthe processes that were at work. The challenge of activity in everyday life is precisely for the \nsubject to run all these processes in parallel with a limited capacity of consciousness (e.g. \nshort term memory), limited capacity for action (two hands) and of perception (limited visual \nfield and focus), within an environment that is not always cooperative. Therefore, some tasks \nmust be fragmented and put in waiting line while others are being processed. In practice, \nhumans show amazing proficiency to do so; they take advantage of the external limitations \nimposed on the activity in order to optimize the use of their resources: e.g. in the following \nexample, during the time the water for tea takes to boil, the subject intercalates tasks relating \nto another course of action. \nThis subject, on coming home, prepares tea. While the water boils, she goes up to her \nroom and opens her computer to check the timetable of the gym for activities; while the \nlaptop boots she goes to the bathroom and collects her dry swimsuit to put in in her gym \nbag. And as she had kneeled in the first place to take her laptop out her school bag, she \nhad collected her sneakers that were on the floor and put them in the gym bag\u2026  \nCordelois provides a similar example of a subcamer making tea after returning home, who \nwas at the same time storing the clean plates etc. She managed to perform 127 operations in \n4:09 minutes (Cordelois, 2010), effortlessly and as part of her daily routine.  \nSubjects are usually unaware of the amazing psycho-motor expertise they display in such \nperformance, which they mostly run in auto-pilot mode. In the example of the gym bag \nmentioned supra, the subject apologized to the interviewer as she found her activity looked \n \n \n33 \n\u2018confused\u2019. It is the main task of the researcher to create trust with an engaging and reassuring \nmanner and set the subjects into a reflexive mode. Showing the subjects how subtle and agile \ninterweaving of operations is the final observed behaviour helps them understand that \ncompared to their splendid overall performance, small hesitations, mistakes or blips are \ninevitable and do not lead to losing face. The subject, now freed of the preoccupation of \nlosing face towards the experimenter, relaxes, enters a reflexive entheaty mode and becomes \ngradually more and more efficient at explicating her activity, in a collaborative and detective-\nlike cooperation with the experimenter. This enables constructing an explanation that is both \nemic and etic, that is accurate from the subject\u2019s perspective although understandable by \nothers.  \nThis is our answer the postulate of adequacy, which is formulated by Sch\u00fctz as follows: \n (\u2026) each term used in a scientific system referring to human action must be so \nconstructed that a human act performed within the life-world by an individual actor in \nthe way indicated by the typical construction would be reasonable and understandable \nfor himself as well as for his fellow man. (Sch\u00fctz, 1976: 19) \nAs one researcher may not always be capable alone to do this re-construction with the subject, \nwe sometimes need experts, or the perspective of other subjects\/analysts who have first-hand \nexperience of the type of situation analysed. In some cases, we proceed to a collective \nanalysis of the film, and include other subjects or experts to construct the explanation. This \ncollective process has been described by Cordelois (2010). \n4.6. Accessing the data \nThis has two aspects. Video must be accessed for analysis purposes by the researchers and \nsubjects. \nIt must also be made available for publication of the results. \nAs video is our primary research material, accessing the data, annotating them, giving access \nto the subject etc. is of crucial importance. We use several systems for video analysis, but the \nmost useful is Diver, an online annotating system developed at Stanford SCIL by Roy Pea and \ncolleagues (Pea and Hoffert 2007; Pea 1994; Pea, Lindgren and Rosen 2008; Pea, Mills, \nRosen et al. 2004) which enables online collaborative analysis of videos by searching, \nvisualizing, annotating and editing in a shared manner all of the videos. With Diver one can \nparticipate in interpreting videos from anywhere one can access the Internet. \nAs this system has been described elsewhere, I shall not expand here, but it must be clear that \nwhatever system is used should enable easy access to the material to both subjects and \nresearchers at any time, and empower them to build together explanations. Diver is a fantastic \ntool in this respect, with an easy interface (a version has been developed for 5-year old \n \n \n34 \nchildren) and of course this easiness of access is a plus when we want to show the data for \npublication (how could a paper article without links to the videos render the content of \naction?) \n \nDiffusion seems to be a more straightforward issue, especially since video has become a very \ncommon media on the internet. One of the fastest growing fields exploring the use of video \nfor non-leisure purposes is in education. Often under the category learning sciences a whole \nrange of application of video in education is investigated (Goldman, Pea, Barron and J. 2007; \nSawyer 2006; Weiss, Nolan, Hunsinger and Trifonas 2006). Nevertheless, a series of serious \nproblems remain: how to present best the subfilms, how to combine the primary material with \ncomments, how to safeguard the subject\u2019s interests in avoiding further reuse of the data out of \ncontext. More development is needed. Inserting links to subfilms in an online paper, as did \n(Brown, Dilley and Marshall 2008) seems to be a good practice that could be generalized. \n5. The view from the other \nThe pace of the subfilms is very different from the motion picture \u2018subjective camera\u2019 \nperspective, in that the subcam constantly follows the head movements. Human head is \nsurprisingly stable, much more than the image obtained by a camera held by hand or shoulder, \nthrough the perfection of the natural system of support and guidance of the head muscles. But \nthe sweeping movements are often very rapid (\u2018ballistic movements\u2019), and can make some \nviewers seasick. For this reason, it is preferable that the person performing the analysis has \ndirect knowledge of the physical environment where the shooting took place, in order to have \na clear proprioceptive representation. It is in her own subjective spatial representation that the \nsubject acts, and it is the same for those who watch the film, making it easier for analysts to \nfollow the action when the environment where it happens is familiar. Analysis of films in a \nfamiliar environment is much less tiring, probably because it requires less effort for sensory \ninterpretation. This calls for the analyst having been in the field herself, which is a limitation. \nInterestingly, as viewers are taken into the perception-action loop of the subcamer in entheaty, \nan identification process emerges and empathy occurs, based on sharing similar \nphenomenological experience. Although we do not get a fully multimodal recording, it seems \nthat the elements recorded on film are enough to elicit in the viewer an experience similar to \nthe subject\u2019s. To what degree this is deceptive is difficult to assess. In theory, this facilitated \nreconstruction effect is a double-edged sword, since my reconstructed experience of e.g. \ndriving a car or eating macaroni will be phenomenologically different from yours, as they \neach are the result of our respective total life-experiences. Theory and practice diverge here. \nExperience shows that entheaty is quite different from empathy. As viewers, we precisely feel \n \n \n35 \nthe small differences in the way the subcamer does things \u2018differently\u2019. In fact, we get a \nfeeling of detachment even when watching our own films. The result is an awareness of what \nthe subcamer is doing (because we identify immediately the typified situations, and correctly \ninfer typified goals), but there is still a feeling of strangeness. More research on this \nphenomenon is needed. \n5.1. Sympathy and fascination \nAnalysis of subfilms is a striking phenomenological experience, for both the researcher and \nthe subject. The subcamer sees his action, in detail but without being caught in the flow of \nactivity and pressure to act. The researcher takes a dive into the world of someone else. \nOver the last dozen years we many times had the opportunity to present our work to \ncolleagues. It became very clear to us that unless one has experienced using the tool it is \nimpossible to get a clear idea of it, because it is so different from external video that one\u2019s \nprevious experience is misleading. The same questions always come up: possible influence of \nthe device on the subjects\u2019 activity, comparison with eye-tracking, reconstruction vs. \nremembrance, influence of the researcher in the confrontation interview, etc. But their \nintuitions are very different from the actual effects. Quite naturally, colleagues suspect our \nown enthusiasm is due to the fact that we invented the technique --- although they often don\u2019t \ndare expressing this scepticism too openly! It is strange indeed that such a minute change as \nfilming from the other\u2019s perspective, and discussing mental activity with the subject based on \nevidence rather than memory would make such a radical difference. Nevertheless, even \ncolleagues who saw subfilms, had long discussions with us, and whom we thought had \nunderstood what it\u2019s about, do come back changed and exhilarated after they tried the \ntechnique for real. Similar change of perspective probably occurred when ethnographers \nstarted going to the field to get a first-hand experience instead of relying on explorers\u2019 travel \nstories as a primary material. \n \nThe idea of voyeurism one could fantasize disappears quickly when viewing the recordings, \nwhere the researcher acquires an empathy with the subcamer. The notion of empathy is \nimproper in that it means sharing emotions, which is not really the case. This is why we had \nto forge the neologism of \u2018entheaty\u2019 to express this new and unprecedented situation in human \nexperience: sharing the spectacle of activity from the actor\u2019s perspective. \nUnlike in motion pictures, nothing is done deliberately to elicit emotions. The subcam is not a \nmode of expression as the conventional film; it produces a raw material, without intent to \n\u2018show\u2019. The researcher is somehow connected in parallel with the subcamer\u2019s sensorimotor \nloop, a bit like a driving instructor. The term \u2018passenger\u2019 used in the film \u2018Being John \nMalkovich\u2019 accounts rather well for this position. \n \n \n36 \nBy closely following the activity with the same visual focus, and to some extent auditory \nfocus we induce some identification mechanism, some ability to guess the thoughts of the \nsubcamer. Our explanation is that not only humans are capable of empathy --- see (Hatfield, \nRapson, et al., 2009) for a review --- but also that in daily life we share so much implicit \nknowledge in a common culture that such exercise is relatively easy. In fact, the subfilm puts \nus \u2018in the shoes\u2019 of the subcamer, and often in her situation we would have acted the same. \nThe socio-cultural context requires certain behaviours, or at least largely determines them, as \nGoffman demonstrated quite convincingly (Goffman 1959). Without such a framework of \nconventions that make the actions of others predictable, social life would be difficult. \nIn a detective story, \u2018Murders Rue Morgue\u2019 (Poe 1978), Edgar Allan Poe describes how, as \ndetective Dupin and his friend walk along in Paris without speaking, Dupin suddenly answers \naloud a thought of his friend, to the amazement of the latter. Then Dupin explains how he \nreconstructed the thread of his friend\u2019s thoughts, or rather followed it, by observing his \nsuccessive foci of attention and mimics during the last few minutes. Dupin, who lives with his \nfriend, could guess correctly the associations of ideas that emerge from a shared culture in a \ngiven context. In the case of the subcamer, provided that the analyst knows the subject and \nher environment, observing subfilms allows him to make similar deductions, as can be \nchecked during the self-confrontation interview. \n \nUnderstanding the meaning of the activity does not exclude a sense of strangeness at the \nviewing of subfilms. Diversity of being-to the-world is the same as with writing styles or \nways of walking. The way one moves and acts is surprisingly personal: more or less abrupt, \nsharp, fluid, reactive. How to manipulate objects, and behave with others, is obviously subject \nto individual variations, as we all know. But it is surprising how perception itself is a matter \nof personal style. As said earlier perception is an activity in itself (Leont'ev 1978), an \nexploration that results from the orientation of sensory organs towards a particular point of the \nscene. In fact, the subfilms show how the dynamics of orientation vary between individuals. \nThey show different personal investment in the situation, according to the degree of coupling \nof their action with the events and the context, as well as by the selection that is made out of \nthis context in order to focus attention and respond. \nSubfilm watching is for the observer the opportunity of an insight on the variety of how \ndifferent individuals perceive the world and a lesson in tolerance. A subfilm is very \nenlightening of the way-of-being of the subcamer. It is therefore an intimate material, which \nmust be approached with respect, sympathy and sensitivity. It is the responsibility of the \nanalyst to extract only materials regarding the on-going research, without exposing to the \npublic the intimate and personal aspects that the material can reveal about the individual \npsychology of the subcamer. \n \n \n37 \n \nSubfilms produce some fascination effect on the viewer. Unlike with films with a fixed \ncamera, or held by an operator, one can watch for hours without boredom subfilms on \nactivities that would otherwise seem tedious, like laying bricks or eating soup, and be \ncaptivated a bit like when watching a campfire. I must insist that this is not only the personal \ncase of this author, but a phenomenon attested by many viewers. That, of course when the \nrelevant details are visible or audible, it is not the case e.g. when the subject reads and we \ncannot distinguish the words. We have yet no definitive explanation for this phenomenon. For \nexample, when the same scene was filmed simultaneously with a fixed camera, and a subcam, \nthe recording derived from the fixed camera often seems uninteresting, while that of subcam \nis quite watchable. It seems to be a kind of capture of the viewer by the phenomenal flow of \nthe subcamer rather than some interest in the action as such, as if the audience was reluctant \nto interrupt the current action. \nThe perception of time is also different between subfilm and fixed camera recordings, and \nbetween reality and subfilm. We have not yet found a general rule, or explanation, but this \neffect is striking enough to have been reported by different analysts. For example, a subfilm \nsequence often appears shorter than the same sequence in external camera. But a subfilm \nsequence sometimes seems longer than the action in reality experienced by the subject \nhimself. For example, a 9 year old subcamer, when watching his subfilm of himself eating \nsoup, asked candidly \u2018You must be joking, you\u2019re showing me the film in slow motion\u2019 (and \nlater eventually fell asleep during self-entheaty). \nThis is even truer for sequences of routine activity. In self-confrontation, routine activity \n(commuting by car, traveling between the office and cafeteria, doing e-mail) appears \u2018much \nlonger than in reality\u2019. Indeed these activities were usually performed in auto-pilot mode. \nXavier de Maistre, in \u2018Voyage autour de ma chambre\u2019 (1794), provides a hilarious account of \nsuch effect by describing how, as he was en route to the king\u2019s palace, his mind started \nwandering and he finally found himself in front of the door of the house of his mistress, \nMadame de Hautcastel, half a mile away from the palace. He describes this as a situation \nwhere \u2018the beast\u2019 (his body) took over operations while his mind was wandering. This is one \nof the limits of the subcam: we do not capture the flow of thoughts in such moments of \nroutine, often used for background considerations, and which the subcamers have some \ndifficulty to recover in self-confrontation, if ever they do. \nSuch effects of strangeness in self-confrontation clearly show that there is a lag between \nentheaty and the initial experience. Therefore the confrontation interview also involves \nadditional reconstruction, because the subject is not exactly in the same situation, especially \nregarding cognitive pressure to act. \n \n \n \n38 \nSympathy for the actor is another surprising effect of viewing subfilms. It becomes difficult if \nnot impossible to bear a moral judgement upon the acts observed, since they include the \nperspective of the actor. From his own perspective, the course of action often seems natural \nand understandable, including errors. The viewing of many subfilms eventually induces a \ngeneral attitude of benevolent neutrality towards the subjects, comparable to the physician's \nand expert\u2019s professional detachment, or the psychotherapist\u2019s. In this perspective, the \nintentions of subjects lose their moral connotations, and are perceived by the researcher as \nmere explanatory factors in the sequences of observed phenomena. This attitude of \ndetachment and \u2018no judgement\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis the data inevitably reflects in the researcher's \nrelationship to the subject, and contributes, we believe, to facilitate acceptance of the protocol \nby the subjects. Their main concern as we have said is indeed to be judged or lose face. \n5.1. Research on inter-subjectivity \nA stimulating aspect of SEBE is the ability it gives the researcher to analyse the same scene \nfrom different individual perspectives. Every individual lives in his own phenomenological \ntunnel. For example, we filmed a dinner between friends, where 2 of the 4 participants wore a \nsubcam, while the scene was also filmed from a fixed camera in the dining room (Lahlou \n1998). The subfilms show that while the guests attend the dinner scene continuously, the host \nfollows parallel courses of action, of guest, cook and host; cooking and doing the service. A \nsimilar experiment where we used three subcams and a panoramic camera in a restaurant also \nshowed that what we consider a single \u2018scene\u2019 covers in fact a series of very different \nindividual \u2018phenomenological tunnel\u2019 paths which cross occasionally.  \nThe subcam clearly shows there is no uniqueness of the situation, because individual \nexperiences are objectively different. Obviously, comparing the bands of several protagonists \nof the same scene show that what they see is different. More worrisome: they do not hear the \nsame thing. As sound is something we would expect to be shared by all participants; this can \nappear somewhat disturbing a finding, discovery. In transcribing the tapes from various \nparticipants of the same scene, we noticed discrepancies in the transcript of different subfilms. \nOverall the transcripts were similar. But in the detail, they varied (e.g. \u2018I mean\u2019 instead of \n\u2018You see\u2019). For example, the order of transcribed speech turns when several people speak \nabout the same time would not be the same, or the moment when two utterances started to \noverlap. Difference in transcription of certain words that are hardly audible on one recording \nand clearer over another was noted. Such effect is normal and can be observed even for \nsuccessive transcriptions of the same tape, because transcription is a difficult exercise that \nneeds a lot of concentration. Here discrepancies did not disappear after several attempts of \ntranscription at normal speed.  \nThe last type of discrepancy (synonyms) points at the nature of the mechanism. Just as visual \n \n \n39 \ninterpretation results from reconstructions of local captures of the scene by the eyes as they \nsample the scene in ocular saccades, then assembled in a mental reconstruction of a \u2018single\u2019 \nscene, language comprehension is probably the result of acoustic sampling of the speech flow \nand reconstruction, with the help of other cues in the context (mimics, mouth movements \netc.). In other words, subjects sample the scene with their senses and reconstruct a global \npicture from this sampling, based on their existing knowledge-of-the-world. Therefore, two \nsubjects situated in different positions may sample different cues, and reconstruct slightly \ndifferent pictures. The coder did not in fact accurately \u2018transcribe\u2019, he reconstructed from \nsampling the speech flow. Because his reconstruction depended on the subcam\u2019s perspective, \nthe coder reconstructed slightly different pictures from different tapes. This would be \nespecially noticeable when the sound was poor; but we can assume that the subjects \nthemselves face identical problems, and so each protagonist \u2018hears\u2019 something slightly \ndifferent depending on where he focuses his attention. Of course, detailed and many times \nrepeated listening for word-by-word transcription would usually in the end produce two \nsimilar transcripts, but this is not the ecological situation where subjects construct \ninterpretation on-the-fly based on ambiguous cues. This has vast implications: Damastism is \nnot only a researcher\u2019s problem, but a general one. We do live in different worlds because all \nwe can access is our own interpretation, which will by construction differ slightly depending \nupon our own position. This is why \u2018reality\u2019 has to be negotiated. This sheds a new light on \nthe nature of inter-subjectivity.  \nOnly through a series of powerful social mechanisms do subjects  manage to join in the same \ninter-subjective space where communication and action occur. Cooperation is  made possible \nbecause all participants share a social representation (Moscovici 2008) of the situation. This \nled to the idea that cooperative action, and social life in general, is rendered possible by the \npsychosocial pact, a na\u00efve realist postulate that \u2018What you see is what I see\u2019 and that we live \nin the same phenomenal world (Lahlou 2006). The existence of such a pact underlying the \ninteraction has often been reported in various forms, including the study of communication, \nwhere participants must share a code (Shannon and Weaver 1949), respect the principle of \ncooperation (Grice 1979), having a communications contract (Ghiglione 1986), referring \nimplicitly to a given narrative world (Eco 1979) etc. \nIn other words, the world is a mosaic of individual views, whatever the naive realists believe. \nBut each view is linked to others through social relationships and communication, and the \nobjects of each other are not independent, whatever the naive solipsist claims. SEBE can help \nstudy in detail the relationship between the three sides of the psychosocial \u2018Ego, Alter, \nObject\u2019 triangle (Faucheux and Moscovici 1971; Newcomb 1953), which is central to the \nproblem of social psychology. It can show the detail of how people manage in practice to \ncooperate despite their different perspectives. E.g. we can peel the fine interleaving between \n \n \n40 \nmodes of verbal and nonverbal communication, particularly in exchanges of glances, which \nare often difficult to capture and analyse with traditional techniques. SEBE is therefore an \nideal method for the social psychologist. \nAlthough we know about all these issues in theory, and even though they have extensively \nbeen discussed in philosophy, situated recording provides fascinating evidence-based insights. \nSEBE enables an evidence-based phenomenology. Using the method to study inter-\nsubjectivity is therefore an exciting avenue for future research. \n6. Applications \nThe method has many potential applications: understanding the nature of social construction \n(from individual perspectives); enabling stakeholders to share perspectives (inclusion, conflict \nresolution); transferring tacit knowledge; studying child development etc. For the time being, \nit has mostly been applied for studying determinants of activity, for basic research on \nrepresentations and inter-subjectivity, for training, to inform change policies, and for design. \nBecause of its mobile nature, the subcam is particularly useful to follow the activity and \npsychological processes of moving subjects. This explains why it has been used by our \ncolleagues to monitor the use of mobile phones at UC Irvine (Christensen 2001; Mark, \nChristensen and Shafae 2002), France-Telecom R&D (Zouinar, Relieu, Salembier and Calvet \n2004), as a contribution to Dominique Boullier\u2019s multimedia laboratory LUTIN (LUCSI \n2003); to track activity in round patrols in nuclear power plants at EDF R&D; to analyse \ndecision-making in occupational therapy (Unsworth 2001), sportsmen or fire-fighters \n(Omodei and McLennan 1994; Omodei, McLennan and Wearing 2005; Omodei, Wearing and \nMcLennan 1997), etc. \nApplications for professional training have recently been presented in this journal. \nProfessional activity of power plant operators has been recorded with subcams and analysed \nusing activity theory (Le Bellu, Lahlou and Le Blanc 2009; Le Bellu, Lahlou and Nosulenko \n2010). The resulting films have been considered a major progress by the training division of \nthe industry concerned. Applications in design have been presented elsewhere: the technique \nis used to follow current activity of operators, spot the difficulties, and try to come up with \nconstructive solutions with the users, which are then fed into a recursive collaborative design \ncycle (Lahlou 2009). Obviously, the technique is well suited to industrial and professional \nenvironments, where access to subjects is easy, where trust can be built on the long term, and \nwhere the activities studied involve few possible interpersonal issues. In such contexts, the \nlimitations of the method are not so important, and can be overcome with the proper \nprotocols. \nBut the technique has great potential for other applications.  \n \n \n41 \nFor the sake of brevity in a paper that is already too long, let us present here one illustration in \nthe domain of social psychology, another one on the construction of representation, and very \nshort anecdotes about interpersonal relations. \n6.1. Social representations \nThis example is borrowed from the work of Sanna Lepp\u00e4m\u00e4ki  on social representations of \nnovel foods and how they are constructed by children and adults (Leppamaki 2004). Subjects \nare recruited to taste new foods, as part (they are led to believe) of marketing tests conducted \nin France by a Finnish company. The example comes from the tasting of \u2018new varieties of \ntomato pur\u00e9e\u2019. The subject, wearing a subcam, is asked to taste 4 cups containing tomato \npur\u00e9e. The cups are completely identical in appearance and contain the same amount of \ntomato pur\u00e9e. The instructions given to the subject are to taste the products and give his \nopinion. Figure 7 shows one of the subjects in the experimental situation and a view taken \nfrom the subcam he wears. \n \n  \n \nFigure 7 : Tasting \u2018new products\u2019 with the subcam (Leppamaki 2004). \n \nThere are four conditions, which are explained to the subject, and cups are labelled \naccordingly: \u2018regular\u2019 pur\u00e9e (the classic brand), \u2018nutritional\u2019 (enriched with vitamins), \n\u2018organic\u2019 pur\u00e9e (tomatoes grown without pesticides), and \u2018GMO\u2019 pur\u00e9e (made from \ngenetically modified tomatoes for better resistance to insects). \nAlthough at first sight the subjects appear to do the similar gestures, and they do not mention \nany difference in their approach of the various products, frame by frame analysis of subfilms \nreveals that some subjects do not take the same amount of different products to taste them, \nand that this difference is not random. In fact, 4 of 11 subjects sampled significantly more \nfrom \u2018organic\u2019 pur\u00e9e than from others products. \n \n \n42 \nAs shown in Figure 8 (which shows a different, left-handed, subject than the one pictured in \nFigure 7), if we take the quantity taken as a reference for the \u2018\u201cregular\u201d pur\u00e9e\u2019, the subject \ntakes a slightly higher amount (about 125%) of the \u2018nutritional\u2019, a much higher amount of the \n\u2018organic\u2019 (over 200%) and a much smaller amount of \u2018GMO\u2019 pur\u00e9e (less than 30%). The \ncomparison clearly shows the influence of representation in the fine modulation of the action \n(see Figure 9 for a close-up). Verbalizations of that subject confirm that he has a prejudice \nagainst GMOs: \u2018When afterwards asked about this the subject admitted his prejudiced bias \nalthough he thought that the amount had no effect on the taste experience.\u2019 (Leppamaki \n2004).  \n \n  \n\u2018regular\u2019 pur\u00e9e      \u2018GMO\u2019 pur\u00e9e  \n  \n\u2018nutritional\u2019 pur\u00e9e     \u2018organic\u2019 pur\u00e9e  \n \nFigure 8 : comparison of quantities sampled by the same subject to taste the four \ndifferent products (Leppamaki 2004) \n \nFigure 9 is a close up of the quantities sampled from the \u2018organic\u2019 and \u2018GMO\u2019 pur\u00e9es. \n \n \n \n43 \n  \n\u2018organic\u2019 pur\u00e9e   \u2018GMO\u2019 pur\u00e9e  \n \nFigure 9 : Close up of the sampling for \u2018organic\u2019 (left) and \u2018GMO\u2019 pur\u00e9e (right) by the \nsame subject.  \n \nOf course, although the subject are led to believe that these are four types of different tomato \npur\u00e9es, it is actually the very same product that has been put in four different cups, which \nensures that differences in verbalization and behaviour are due solely to the subject\u2019s own \nrepresentations. A most interesting part of the observed differences is that the subject whose \nactions are described in the previous figures said the \u2018organic\u2019 pur\u00e9e had more taste, while the \n\u2018GMO\u2019 pur\u00e9e had no taste. One might suppose that the quantities actually tasted may have \ncontributed to the sensory evaluation; therefore the subject\u2019s action would in this case have \nproduced a self-fulfilling prophecy. \nOther verbalizations show that subjects tend to attribute qualities to pur\u00e9e in consonance with \ntheir representation, whereas in fact these differences derive from their own behaviour. For \nexample: \nThree subjects thought that the \u2018the GMO pur\u00e9e\u2019 was worse than the others. One of \nthese three also found the best (fresh) taste in \u2018the organic pur\u00e9e\u2019 --- which she didn\u2019t \nhowever attribute to drinking water just before tasting; (\u2026) \nSubject [drinks water, tastes two spoonful\u2019s of the organic pur\u00e9e, looks at the samples] \nThis is [points to the organic pur\u00e9e] at least better than this, [points to the GMO pur\u00e9e, \nlooks at the interviewer] (Interviewer: Yes) it has somehow a more fresh taste \n(Interviewer: Yes) [takes a spoonful of ordinary pur\u00e9e, looks at it, takes then organic \npur\u00e9e] I don\u2019t find big differences in these but maybe, I somehow like this, [points to \nthe organic pur\u00e9e] quite good taste [nods a little] (Leppamaki 2004). \nThis example shows how SEBE allows an understanding of mechanisms that would be \ndifficult to grasp with other protocols, especially as the effect observed here was not planned \nin the experiment. It was assumed that differences would emerge, but it was not known a \npriori which ones. The self-fulfilling aspect of representations appears as a corollary of using \n \n \n44 \nrepresentations to guide action: the subject tends to explore only the channels provided by her \nrepresentation, and the latter is confirmed. Damastism, again. But also this gives food for \nthought about the actual detailed mechanisms of social (re)construction of the world (Berger \nand Luckmann 1966). \n6.2. Interpersonal relations \nSEBE provides fine-grained accounts of interpersonal relations. Space lacks here to describe \nin detail several examples, because precisely, as \u2018an image is worth a thousand words\u2019 the \ndetail of gestures and facial expressions is much better rendered directly by showing the \nsubfilm than describing it, and this is why video should be used not only for conducting the \nresearch but also for publishing the results.  \nLet us briefly mention some examples. The way one of our subcamers, a brick layer (who is \nwearing the high resolution version on his safety helmet, which is rather spectacular), stops in \na corridor to let his colleague take a picture of him wearing the subcam on a construction site, \nalthough this is obviously disturbing him in his work, evidences, by his very posture and \ncompliance, the good spirit in their team and the kind temper of this man.  \nOn another film, a 9-year old subcamer gently pulls the ear of his grandfather and plays with \nit as the latter, a fierce looking man retired from the Russian military, cuts his food for him. \nAlthough the grandfather obviously tries to manage the image of an authority figure to the \nboy, the way he reacts to the boy\u2019s familiar but somewhat annoying behaviour, in a very \nbenevolent \u2018I did not notice\u2019 way clearly shows the grandfather\u2019s loving care for the boy and \nthe limited span of his authority.  \nIn another instance, during a friends\u2019 dinner, after a somewhat sarcastic exchange, where it \nappeared in full light, through his partner\u2019s description of their journey, that one of the guest \nis a dangerous driver, the latter is served wine by the host immediately after the incident. The \nanalysis in slow motion of the serving, where there is a series of minute reciprocal \nadjustments between the glass and the bottle held by the host and guest, serves as a silent \nconfirmation of the friendly link between them, and reassures the guest on the absence of \nimpact of him publicly losing face. \nWe deliberately chose positive examples, but there are other kinds. For example, it is frequent \nthat male subjects look automatically at some specific parts of female\u2019s bodies; this appears \nclearly on subfilms, which may create embarrassing situations during analysis in a working \ncontext.  \nAlthough we are now exploring the use of SEBE in family counselling, where we believe it \nmay have considerable impact, we do advise novices against engaging into such endeavour, \nprecisely because SEBE may uncover very significant details (see infra: ethics, section 7.2). \n \n \n45 \n7. Limitations \n7.1. Being observed \nIf the subject is aware of being observed, observation may modify the behaviour. This is \nespecially obvious when the observer is present in situations where private interactions take \nplace. \nWhen observed, subjects tend to stick to the rules of the group. In fact, what matters is less the \npresence of the observer herself than the group she represents. This is why it is still possible \nto get good observations when the subject is promised confidentiality, that \u2018only the observer \nwill know\u2019. If the subject does not fear being seen misbehaving by the members of his in-\ngroup (e.g. the viewers are from another group; or the subject thinks his behaviour is \nacceptable, or has a status such that it does not matter, etc.), then the effect of observation is \nminor. \nThere are also possible implications of the fact that the subject knows that his behaviour will \nbe traced by automatic instruments. (Nosulenko, Pavard, Rognin and Samoylenko 1993) \nprovide an interesting example of such a case, in which operators in a space-mission control \ncentre had to go away from the official --- and traced --- communication system to solve a \nproblem in an unconventional manner, and then denied having done so.  \nUsing wearables, as the subject becomes her\/his own observer, partly solves the problem of \nmodification of behaviour by the observation. The subject feels like an observer as well as an \n\u2018observed\u2019. This seems to make the subject feel more in control of her data, especially if, as \nwe do in our protocols, the subject sees the data first and only hands them over to the \nresearcher if (s)he is satisfied with their content. But, in order to use this effect and get across \nthe limitations, the protocol described supra is necessary. \n7.2. Ethics \nThroughout this paper ethics has been mentioned continuously, especially in its role as a \n\u2018research tool\u2019 to build trust. However, another word of caution may also be necessary. \nThe observation of one\u2019s own records can be an instructive but tough exercise. For example, \nthe author, among other unpleasant habits, has that of imposing his conversation with his \ninterlocutors in embarking on lengthy tirades. Not only that appeared in full light while \nwatching his films, furthermore a feature of the subcam shows how much this bothers his \ninterlocutors, including his relatives. In normal conversation, the speakers will have direct eye \ncontact only a small percentage of the time (about 15%). Eye contact is an experience too \nintense to be protracted too long; social control imposes specific facial expressions, especially \nto express attention, which may require some effort. In fact, therefore, when two people \n \n \n46 \ndiscuss, they mostly look a little off. The subcam, which does not follow the direction of eyes \nbut of face continues to film the other\u2019s face, and thus reveals her mimics when she listens to \nyou, and believes you do not see her face. These facial expressions are so often \nembarrassingly revealing the depth of her thought (boredom, disbelief, stress etc.) This means \nthat the researcher must be extremely careful when using the method, and when clipping \nshould get rid mercilessly of any sequences that could prove too embarrassing for the \nparticipants. This is especially the case in interpersonal relations within the family or at work. \nAlthough the subject may be vaguely aware of some relational issues with his relatives, seeing \nthe evidence in slow motion and in detail may be hard to swallow, and difficult to forget. And \nof course the researcher should avoid at all costs displaying sequences that would cause a \nsocial problem to the participants: making them lose face, evidencing professional errors, etc. \nOn the other hand, the fact the subcamer is hardly identifiable on the recordings can often \nsolve such issues. \nTherefore SEBE is potentially harmful if led without utmost care of the subject\u2019s interest. \nGetting signed informed consents is not enough. The researcher must evaluate potential loss \nof face, and not use \u2018risky\u2019 films. Some interesting raw data must often be discarded for this \nreason. \n7.3. Preparation phase \nThe preparation phase, as said earlier, can be heavy, especially in public spaces. As an \nexample, when we recorded the activity of IT technicians in the LSE \u2018laptop surgery\u2019 (where \nstudents can step in to have their laptop issues resolved, see supra the example in section 3.4) \nwe encountered no problem of acceptance with the technicians themselves, who found the \nexercise quite interesting. But we had to set up a warning sign on the door, and to keep \nconstantly three researchers who would explain the situation to the \u2018clients\u2019 who stepped in, \nget their informed consent signed, track in detail who would not want to appear on the films. \nThe case occurred, and one of these persons, who was only accompanying a student, did not \neven want to give his name or have his picture taken so we could know who was to be blurred \non the recording.  \n \nThe researcher will have access to the records only after their review and possible censorship \nby the subcamer. This is a limitation in that it makes the protocol more difficult to apply since \nthere must be one more occurrence of contact with the subject to get the recordings back. This \nadds to the subject\u2019s tasks. But this is important for trust: the subject knows she will be in \ncontrol at all times of what has been recorded, and no bad surprise is to fear. For this reason, \nonly in exceptional cases do we use the wireless transmission version of the subcam, where \nsubcamer loses control over his records during recording (and may fear we keep a copy). \n \n \n47 \nThese precautions may seem superfluous\u2013 in the sense that subcamers almost never erase any \npart of the film, that often they don\u2019t watch the whole recording or do so at accelerated speed, \netc. Many subjects propose to waive right away their right to preview the film; because they \ntrust the researcher. But this trust has precisely been built by the control they have over their \nrecording. Therefore this preview phase is somewhat a paradox: subjects do not use it, but if it \nwas not there the whole nature of the psychological contract would be different. \n7.4. The device and the protocol \nUsing a technical device always brings extra technical burden. \nAlthough we have recorded hundreds of sessions, we still sometimes get poor quality \nrecordings due to a faulty connector, a discharged battery, a full memory card, deficient prior \nmarking of recordings, inadequate camera adjustment, or simply because the experimenter \nforgot to start the recording and left the device on \u2018pause\u2019 mode. It is therefore useful to use a \nchecklist. It is highly  hazardous to rely on the subject to start the recording himself in \nabsence of a researcher, e.g. at home, unless the subject has experience, and has been \ncarefully instructed. \nOperating with many subcams means keeping track of the charge level of batteries, bringing \nspare equipment, having the right plug adapters in various countries, and a crowd of other \ndetails that would be cumbersome to enumerate. Every new situation brings unexpected new \nissues and makes scouting the field an almost inescapable requisite. \n \nThe protocol itself is rather heavy. But this must be compared with other classic protocols. \nWe designed the subcam in the 1990\u2019s when we were studying the use of information in \norganizations, where we had tested a large array of techniques. In fact, all the classic \ntechniques we had tried failed to capture precisely what was relevant for the activity. Fixed \ncameras in offices did not capture details --- and subjects were out of their offices half of the \ntime anyway, in meeting rooms or other places. \u2018Shadowing\u2019 the subject all day and taking \nnotes (Mintzberg 1968)) was cumbersome for both subject and observer and not accurate \nenough. Interviews completely missed the point (Conein 1997; Fischler and Lahlou 1995; \nLahlou and Fischler 1996) Protocols that try to get the flow of thoughts made overt by \n\u2018talking out loud\u2019 face social limitations, especially in situations where verbal interaction is \nneeded, e.g. conversation. This basically excludes using such techniques for any interpersonal \ninteraction, which is problematic in social science. And in participant observation, observers \nhave to rely on their memory of the events, which is fragile, fragmentary, and subject to \nreconstruction. We then turned to video, but met the problems described supra (body \nocclusion, etc.). Solving the issues raised by these classic techniques when studying activity \nwill oblige to triangulate with several techniques, and involve incurring vast costs in the \n \n \n48 \ntranscription, coding and analysis phases. \n7.5. Distributed cognition \nHuman action is distributed. For example, in a scene happening in a restaurant, many local \nactions are relevant: what happens at the tables, but also what the waiters are doing in the \ndining room, what they are doing backstage, and what the cooks are doing because all these \nare connected in a functional chain. And indeed each stake-holder to some extent takes into \naccount what the others are doing in order to act properly. Therefore, a full explanation for the \nsake of education or transmission should provide the whole picture. A representation of the \nwhole situation, as the state of things and beings that surround us, is necessary to understand \nwhat was at stake in the experience that is being transmitted. This means that the subcam, for \nthe study of complex situations, should be supplemented with other recording sources which \nprovide a global perspective. \n360\u00b0 panoramic video cameras enable capturing complex scenes in one single take and take \nany perspective for analysis. But panoramic films are difficult to analyse for the human brain. \n8. Conclusion and future perspectives \nRecent research, especially in anthropology, psychology and cognitive science, have \ndemonstrated that human activity is by nature situated, that cognition is distributed, that \nbehaviour is the result of a cultural installation, where the material affordances of the setting \nplay as important a role as the social and psychological aspects. It entails that it is, to put it \nmildly, optimistic to hope that we can explore human activity in laboratory settings; those are \nbetter suited to demonstration than to exploration. This calls for observation in natural \nsettings. The solution is to have the real world as an observation setting; the subcam is a \nsolution for this, regarding the capture of relevant, situated, data. \nThe problems linked with introspection have always been a limitation to accessing mental \nstates of the subjects in psychology. We have shown here that protocols confronting the \nsubject with empirical evidence of activity from her own perspective enables going beyond \nthe current state of the art in psychological investigation, by empowering the subject to peel \nthe various layers of mental states underlying a given behaviour. The technique presented is \ntherefore a progress in this respect. \nFinally, the classic emic\/etic issue draws or delete attention to the problems of translating \nsubjective experience into a representation that can be shared across cultures. We have \nsuggested here that evidenced based discussion between the subject and the researcher \nprovides ground for a new kind of collaborative investigation process. The results of this \nprocess are better trans-subjective description and explication: they can be understood and \n \n \n49 \nvalidated by both parties. \nFurthermore, the empirical material used (subfilms) can directly be included in the \npresentation, therefore enabling better illustration, control, and further interpretation from the \noriginal data. \nCombining these aspects (situated capture, empowered introspection, collaborative \ninvestigation and presentation of the original material) opens, in our experience, \nunprecedented possibilities to understand and share human experience.  \n \nThe method still faces limitations: technical of course, but these are disappearing with \ntechnological progress. A major limitation is the cost of trust building with the participants, \nand trust is the key resource in the method. Preparation is more cumbersome than with classic \ntechniques. The method also requires a systematic follow-up with the participants, which is a \nrather new concern in social sciences outside of longitudinal studies. \nEthical issues arise from the fact that the method uncovers very private and sensitive aspects \nof individual psychology. \nNew theoretical tools are necessary to model the phenomena that appear. The nature of \nentheaty, as well as the precise mechanisms involved in data-assisted remembrance, is yet to \nbe investigated.  \nFinally, diffusion of the results needs to make use of video, which questions the limitations of \ncurrent scientific output formats, mostly limited to text and fixed image. \n \nOur feeling in comparing the weight and complication of various techniques across our \nexperiences is that, for the study of activity with objects SEBE is usually best. For research \nwithin bounded environments with a small number of subjects well known to the subcamer (a \nhome, a small unit in an organisation), SEBE will systematically often be a better choice, and \nin fact lighter than other collection techniques for a far better output. SEBE can be appropriate \nfor field work which stays within the boundaries of the same organization setting because the \ninvestment serves for all captures, but the preparation cost is higher than with classic \ntechniques. For studies in very open environments like public places where interpersonal \ninteraction needs to be recorded, one should carefully weigh the pros and cons because the \nissues linked with right to image may be too heavy to handle, and classic techniques are \nusually easier to apply there. \n \nExploring inter-subjectivity is one of the major issues of social science. We intend to use \nSEBE in order to enable individuals to have an insight of what is another person\u2019s life. The \nSHEOS (Subjective Human Experience Observation System) project led by the London \nSchool of Economics and Political Science and involving many colleagues (at Stanford, the \n \n \n50 \nRussian Academy of Science, CNRS, UCSD, UCLA, the Max Planck Institute etc.) is \ncurrently building a worldwide database of \u2018days\u2019 or \u2018activities\u2019 (e.g. eating, taking the train, \nfamily life, education etc.) lived by humans of all ages, conditions, and backgrounds.  \nThese recordings are collected by people wearing the subcam during their normal activity and \ncommenting the resulting subfilm following the technique we described here. While the full \nrecordings will be archived for scientific, and especially historical and ethnographic purposes, \na special format enables to shorten their presentation to smaller clips, therefore providing \nother people some access to the insight of \u2018being in that person\u2019s shoes\u2019. This is a way to go \nbeyond the usual limitations of someone\u2019s perspective  to the one of the in-group to which \n(s)he was ascribed by birth: \nThe crucial fact about birth-ascription for the individual and for society lays not so \nmuch in the source of status (birth), as in the fact that it cannot be repudiated, \nrelinquished, or altered. Everyone is sentenced for life to a social cell shared by others \nof like birth, separated from and ranked relative to all other social cells. (Berreman \n1972)  \nWhat is true for birth ascription is also true for age, and to some extent  for all acquired social \npositions. As perspectival research is now demonstrating, having shared the other\u2019s \nperspective can make communication much easier, especially when there is potential \nmisunderstanding or conflict (Gillespie and Cornish, 2010). We hope that providing access to \nthe Other\u2019s perspective on a large scale will have positive effects on humanity in general, and \nintend to use the method in this political perspective. \nThe human experience database will be a global resource for social sciences, which will be \ndata-mined for theoretical exploration on inter-subjectivity, activity, memory, \ncommunication, development but also validation\/falsification of behavioural theories on \u2018real \nworld\u2019 data, comparative or historical studies, etc. SHEOS also will inform and support \ninclusion policies (e.g. inter-group reconciliation, accessibility, gender studies) by giving \naccess to the perspective of the discriminated \u2018Other\u2019.  \nTraining, especially professional is naturally another of line of SHEOS. \n \nFinally, we must remind the method is still in infancy and has been limited by the fact that \nvery few researchers have used it so far. We are confident that in a few years, when trans-\nsubjective methods like SEBE will have become a classic tool in social science, many of the \nlimitations we listed will be overcome; and practitioners will be able to look back with a \nbemused smile at our current pathetic efforts to set up and clarify the method. \n \n \n \n \n \n51 \nFunding \nThis project was awarded an LSE Research Seed Fund grant 2010 #1-KEX-4042. \n \nNotes \n \n \n1. This entails from the fact that a category is defined not in isolation, but rather as in \n(\u2018paradigmatic\u2019) relation and contrast to all other elements of the culture. Since not two \nphenomena are ever exactly identical, whether this event is \u2018same\u2019 or \u2018different\u2019 to this other \nis a matter of cultural judgement. \n2. Abduction is a process by which we select hypotheses to explain an observation. \nThe term was coined by Charles Peirce and can be described as a form of guessing. Formally, \nit may be considered a syllogism where the major premise is certain and the minor is only \nprobable, likely, or plausible. Or the selection of a hypothesis that is sufficient and likely, to \nexplain the observation, but not necessary (e.g. the grass is wet: probably because it rained \nlast night). Abduction does not have a unique clear cut logical formulation because it is a \nprocess rather than a rule.
