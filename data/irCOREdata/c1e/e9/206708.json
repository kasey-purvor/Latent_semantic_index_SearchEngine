Reforms have come and gone, but until the\nlate 1990s they had been applied similarly across the\nfour countries of the UK. Although the NHS has never\nbeen homogeneous, in practice the policy differences\nbetween the countries have been marginal compared\nwith the similarities. However, in 1998 the Labour gov-\nernment devolved power to an elected parliament in\nScotland, an elected assembly in Wales, and, until it was\nsuspended in 2002, an elected assembly in Northern\nIreland.\nAlthough the powers of each political body differ,\neach has important freedoms with respect to NHS\npolicy. As a result, in England, the emphasis has been\non national targets to improve performance (particu-\nlarly reducing waiting times), increasing capacity, and\nsharper market-style incentives. In Scotland, the 1990s\nquasi-market has been abolished and steps taken to\nbuild a professionally led, integrated system based on\nconcepts such as managed clinical networks. In Wales,\nthe focus has been on improving the public health\nthrough partnership working between the local NHS,\nlocal government, and communities, and in Northern\nIreland, developments have been stalled by political\nuncertainty.1 2 What is the effect of these differences in\nemphasis of policy?\nMethods\nWe used routine data on performance of the NHS in\neach country to compare health indicators for 2002-3\nwith those in 1996-7 (before devolution). The baseline\ndata were from a previous study by one of the authors.3\nWe present six sets of indicators relating to health, per\ncapita expenditure, inputs (such as staff and beds),\nactivity (such as inpatient and day case rates), rates of\nselected operations, and other outputs (such as waiting\ntimes).\nAfter collecting the data, we tried to contact people\nwith overall responsibility for health statistics in each\ncountry and have successfully confirmed the accuracy\nof the data we have used for Northern Ireland,\nScotland, and Wales. There seems to be no one who\ncan do this for England. The detailed definitions of\neach of the indicators, their sources, and discrepancies\nbetween the data are given on the King\u2019s Fund website\n(www.kingsfund.org.uk\/document.rm?id = 5793).\nHealth indicators\nTable 1 shows that life expectancy has risen in all four\ncountries and for both sexes during 1996-2002. The\ngain in life expectancy has been roughly a year,\nalthough the increase is likely to be attributable as\nmuch to rising living standards and better conditions\nin early life as to the actions of the NHS and mirrors\ntrends in many countries in the Organisation for Eco-\nnomic Cooperation and Development.4\nThe all cause standardised mortality ratio indicates\nonly slight signs of convergence between the four\ncountries as life expectancy has lengthened, with Scot-\nland having the highest ratio. In infant mortality, the\ntrend in the early 1990s of declining rates in the UK5\nhas continued in all four countries. Likewise, perinatal\nmortality has fallen in all countries except Wales.\nThe prevalence of self-reported illness and\nrestricted activity among people living in the\ncommunity from sample surveys shows no trend either\nover the study period or between the four countries.\nThe proportion of the population self-reporting illness\nhas tended to rise decade on decade since the 1970s,\nthough the increase has slowed since the 1980s.6 The\nScots report lower rates of longstanding and limiting\nlongstanding illness than the English. We have found\nno evidence to explain this, but it may be because more\nScots die prematurely and so do not survive to experi-\nence limiting chronic conditions.\nExpenditure and other inputs\nEngland has had the lowest spending per capita in\neach year and Scotland the highest (table 2). Although\neach country introduced formulas to guide the alloca-\ntion of resources to achieve equitable spending per\ncapita in the late 1970s, no such policy has been\napplied between the countries of the UK.7 8 Over the\nsix years from 1996, per capita spending has increased\nby 30% in England, 28% in Northern Ireland, 22% in\nWales, and 20% in Scotland. These crude statistics do\nnot take account of differences between countries in\nneed for health care arising from age or morbidity. If\nallocations of resources for each country were based\non the size of populations weighted by standardised\nmortality ratios (but not adjusted for differences in age\nstructures), then Scotland would have 20% higher\nexpenditure per capita than England rather than the\ncurrent 16%.\nWe found it difficult to find a common source for\nwhat ought to be basic information.

However, England still only has just over\nhalf the number of beds per 1000 population as Scot-\nland. Most of the bed losses seem to have been in the\nlong stay or non-acute sector, and the availability of\nacute beds has risen in all countries. As a result, the\nNHS is increasingly providing an acute service, as\nshown by the rising proportion of day and outpatient\ntreatment (see below).\nAll four countries have had increases in medical\nand dental staff during the study period (table 3). Scot-\nland and Northern Ireland started with the highest\nnumber of staff per 1000 population, and although\nEngland has gained staff per capita, its position relative\nto Scotland has scarcely altered. The number per\ncapita of nursing, health visiting, and midwifery staff\nhas risen by 0.5% in England, Scotland, and Wales and\nby 0.1% in Northern Ireland. Scotland still has the\nmost nurses per capita.\nActivity\nTable 4 shows that bed occupancy rose between 1996\nand 2002 in all four countries and is now over 80%.\nRates of outpatient appointments\/1000 population\nhave risen in all four countries, notably in Wales and\nEngland, although in all countries the ratio of new to\nfollow-up appointments was similar. Rates of proce-\ndures carried out as day cases have also risen in all\ncountries except for Wales, where, puzzlingly, the rate\nseems to have dropped by over half between 1996 and\n2002. The rate of inpatient admissions rose slightly in\nNorthern Ireland, stayed roughly the same in Scotland,\nbut dropped slightly in England and Wales, possibly as\na result of a slight reduction in beds. The increases in\nthe NHS workforce over this period have been accom-\npanied by falls in crude rates of productivity as\nmeasured by outpatient appointments and inpatient\nadmissions per medical or dental staff member and per\nnurse.\nOperation rates\nOperation rates for selected common procedures have\nincreased in all four countries (table 5). An exception\nto this is varicose vein surgery, for which rates dropped\neverywhere except Northern Ireland. Given the\nconstraints on the supply of surgery, it may be that\ngreater priority has been given to other procedures (as\nvaricose vein surgery has a larger discretionary\nelement than other procedures), treatment has been by\ninjections (which would not be recorded as this is an\noutpatient procedure), or greater numbers of patients\nwere seeking care outside the NHS.\nThe biggest rise was in operations for cataracts\n(extracapsular extraction of lens and prosthesis of\nlens), especially in England. Despite the high numbers\nTable 1 Health indicators for UK countries\nIndicator\nEngland Scotland Wales Northern Ireland\n1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3\nStandardised mortality ratio:\nMen 98 98 119 119 102 102 109 102\nWomen 98 98 116 113 102 104 108 102\nLife expectancy (years):\nMen 74.5 76.2 72.2 73.5 73.9 75.6 73.8 75.6\nWomen 79.6 80.7 77.9 78.9 79.1 80.2 79.2 80.4\nPerinatal mortality\/1000 8.7 8.3 9.2 7.6 7.5 7.7 9.4 8.9\nInfant mortality\/1000 6.1 5.2 6.2 5.3 5.6 4.5 5.8 4.7\nProportion reporting illness (%):\nLongstanding illness 35 35 33 31 38 38 34 36\nLimiting longstanding illness 22 21 21 18 26 24 25 26\nTable 2 Total NHS expenditure per capita by country\nExpenditure per capita (\u00a3)\n1996-7 2002-3\nEngland 831 1085\nScotland 1047 1262\nWales 968 1186\nNorthern Ireland 944 1214\nTable 3 Availability of hospital beds and health staff in UK countries\nInput\nEngland Scotland Wales Northern Ireland\n1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3\nHospital beds\/1000 population\n(all specialties)\n4.1 3.8 7.7 6 5.3 5 5.7 4.9\nHospital beds in acute\nspecialties (% of total beds)\n76.2 79.4 68.2 72.1 78.1 81.4 71.2 73.5\nStaff\/1000 population:\nMedical and dental* 1.1 1.4 1.5 1.8 1.2 1.4 1.3 1.6\nNursing, midwifery, and\nhealth visiting*\n5 5.6 6.9 7.4 5.9 6.4 6.9 7\nGeneral practitioners\u2020 0.56 0.57 0.72 0.76 0.6 0.61 0.62 0.63\n*Whole time equivalent.\n\u2020Unrestricted principals.\nInformation in practice\n947BMJ VOLUME 331 22 OCTOBER 2005 bmj.com\nof people waiting for hip replacement, the increase in\noperation rates was modest in Wales, Scotland, and\nNorthern Ireland, although it was proportionately\nhigher in England.

In\nScotland, however, the Information and Statistics Divi-\nsion publishes statistics that largely focus on waiting\ntimes for patients who have been treated, and Dixon\nhas shown that using this different data source gives\ndifferent results.9 We therefore have not reported wait-\ning times for Scotland in table 6.\nBefore April 2003, Scotland had two waiting lists: a\ntrue waiting list and a deferred waiting list for patients\nwho had been unavailable for admission for a time for\nmedical or social reasons or had not attended on an\noffered admission date.10 Patients on the deferred wait-\ning list were not covered by national waiting time guar-\nantees. Data were collected on waiting times for\npatients on the true waiting list only. At the end of\nMarch 2003, only one patient with a guarantee on the\ntrue waiting list for elective admission had been waiting\nmore than 12 months. The statistics on patients\ntreated, which include patients from both types of wait-\ning lists (including patients without a waiting time\nguarantee), show that more than 7000 elective patients\ntreated the following year had waited more than 12\nmonths.\nTable 4 Comparison of NHS activity in UK countries\nEngland Scotland Wales Northern Ireland\n1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3\nBed occupancy (%) 81.3 85.4 80.6 81.4 78.3 82.5 78.9 84.3\nGeneral practitioner\nconsultations per person\n5 4 6 4 5 5 NA* NA*\nOutpatient activity\nTotal appointments\/1000\npopulation\n842.6 899.8 927.1 931.1 888.7 972.3 852 861.8\nNew appointments\/1000\npopulation\n232.5 262.7 256.8 260.7 230.7 252.2 234.4 240.2\nRatio of new to return\nappointments\n2.62 2.43 2.61 2.57 2.85 2.86 2.63 2.59\nInpatient and day case\nactivity\nDay cases\/1000 population 61 75 75.4 83.1 99 45.6 58.8 81.7\nInpatient admissions\/1000\npopulation\n171 157 189 188 177 174 180.4 192.6\nCrude productivity (No of\nevents\/staff member)\nOutpatient appointment:\nDoctors and dentists 766.0 642.7 618.1 517.3 740.6 694.5 655.4 538.6\nNurses, midwives, and\nhealth visitors\n168.5 160.7 134.4 125.8 150.6 151.9 121.9 122.6\nHospital admissions:\nDoctors and dentists 155.5 112.1 126.0 104.4 147.5 124.3 138.8 120.4\nNurses, midwives, and\nhealth visitors\n34.2 28.0 27.4 25.4 30.0 27.2 25.8 27.4\n*NA=Not available= Data not recorded\nTable 5 Comparison of NHS operation rates per 10 000 population for selected procedures in UK countries\nProcedure (OPCS4\nclassification*)\nEngland Scotland Wales Northern Ireland\n1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3 1996-7 2002-3\nExtracapsular extraction of\nlens (C71)\nNA\u2020 54.2 31.1 40.2 31.6 55.3 29.6 39.3\nProsthesis of lens (C75) 28.7 54.6 31.7 40.6 39.2 57.1 30 39.5\nExcision of gall bladder\n(J18)\n7.1 9.4 10.5 11.7 10.5 11 9.9 12.8\nInguinal hernia (T20) 16.8 16.7 12.5 11.1 14.1 14.6 10.4 12\nTotal prosthetic\nreplacement of knee joint\n(W40-W42)\n5 8.5 4.9 6.9 5.9 8.6 3.9 4.1\nVaricose vein operation\n(L85-L87)\n11.2 9.4 26 24.9 17.9 12 11.8 12.7\nHip replacement\n(W37-W39)\n6.9 8.7 9.2 9.9 9.4 9.4 8.9 8.7\nCoronary artery bypass\ngrafting (K40-K46)\n4.7 5.1 8.6 9.8 4.2 7.7 5.4 3.2\n*Office of Population Censuses and Surveys classification of surgical operations and procedures, 4th revision.\n\u2020Data not available free of charge.\nInformation in practice\n948 BMJ VOLUME 331 22 OCTOBER 2005 bmj.com\nFor the other UK countries the most striking\ndivergence is in the times people have to wait for a first\noutpatient appointment and an elective admission\n(table 6). Policies in England have been directed at\nreducing these waiting times by setting and imple-\nmenting quantitative, time specific targets, with strong\nperformance management and sanctions for failure.13\nBetween 1996 and 2002, performance in England\nimproved across all measures of waiting times for\ninpatients and day cases: the total percentage of the\npopulation waiting reduced, and the proportion wait-\ning less than six months for an elective admission\nincreased to 80%. In the other countries, these\nstatistics worsened.\nIn 2002, England had the lowest percentage of the\npopulation waiting and virtually no one had to wait\nmore than six months for a first outpatient\nappointment or more than 12 months for an elective\nadmission. In contrast, in Wales and Northern Ireland\naround a third of patients were waiting longer than six\nmonths for an outpatient appointment and the\nproportion waiting more than 12 months for\nadmission was 16% and 22%.\nTable 6 shows public satisfaction with various\naspects of the NHS. The survey in Northern Ireland11\nasked slightly different questions from the survey in the\nother three countries,12 and the statistics may not be\ncomparable. Satisfaction decreased across all reported\nmeasures in Wales, particularly for outpatient and gen-\neral practitioner care, and increased in Northern\nIreland, where satisfaction was extraordinarily high.\nThe reported measures of satisfaction for both\nEngland and Scotland showed increases for the\ngeneral running of the NHS, decreases for general\npractitioner care, and marginal changes for inpatient\nand outpatient care.\nEffects of divergence\nWe used a small number of indicators to compare the\nNHS in 2002 with 1996. Although we tried to make\nthe indicators comparable, some of the definitions\nused in each country differ. The quality of data may\nvary too. Nevertheless, the indicators provide a useful\ndescription of the systems, albeit at a very aggregate\nlevel, and this analysis has identified some important\ntrends.\nThe data do not suggest that the UK countries with\nhigher levels of real healthcare resources or expendi-\nture have more activity, better population health, or\nhigher levels of public satisfaction. Hence these\noutcomes may be more dependent on how resources\nare deployed and how factors outside the healthcare\nsystem influence health.\nDespite the extra finance to the NHS over the\nperiod, the numbers of healthcare staff per 1000\npopulation rose only modestly. Rates of operations for\nwhich people commonly wait have all risen, particu-\nlarly in England, although the rise in England is\nsmaller than might be expected given the investment\nmade and the political and managerial priority given\nto reducing waiting.\nThe most striking differences between 1996 and\n2002 are in the reported reductions in waiting in Eng-\nland, which seem to be the result of strong\nperformance management against targets. Policies of\nother countries may take a longer time to show\nbenefits or have made greater headway on indicators\nnot selected here. The thorough study by Leatherman\nand Sutherland that developed and reported indica-\ntors of quality using routinely collected data found only\nsix indicators for comparing effectiveness across the\nfour UK countries.14 They showed that (for 2002, unless\notherwise indicated): Scotland had the highest rates of\nbreast screening coverage of women aged 50-64, influ-\nenza vaccination for the over 65s (2004), and MMR\nvaccination coverage of 2 year olds (2001); England\nhad the lowest mortality from colorectal cancer and\ncoronary heart disease; and Wales had the highest\nrates of statin prescribing.\nWe have been astonished at the difficulty, and in\nsome cases impossibility, of obtaining valid comparable\nbasic statistics on the NHS in the four countries. Devo-\nlution has resulted in natural experiments of divergent\npolicies across these countries, with huge and increas-\ning sums of public money spent on both health care\nand new computerised systems for collecting data.

BMJ 2003;326:457-8.\n(Accepted 1 September 2005)\nSummary points\nSince devolution in 1998, it has become more\ndifficult to collect comparable data across the four\nUK countries, particularly on NHS expenditure\nand waiting times\nNHS activity and health outcomes seem more\ndependent on how healthcare resources are\ndeployed than higher levels of resources\nThe most striking difference between the\ncountries in 2002 was the shorter waiting times in\nEngland, which introduced enforced targets for\nwaiting\nbmjlearning.com\nIf at first you don\u2019t succeed . . . sue\nIn times past if you failed an exam at medical school you had a\n\u201clong dark tea time of the soul.\u201d You asked yourself why you spent\nall that time in the college bar, the snooker hall, or in classical\ncivilisation lectures. You vowed not to leave it all to the last minute\nfor the repeats. But these days\u2014in the United States at least\u2014if\nyou don\u2019t succeed you can always sue.\nFirstly, you and your lawyers can look at the validity of the\nexam. If you pass the exam does that mean that that you\u2019re ready\nto work as a doctor? If you fail does that mean that you\u2019re not\nready? If the answer to either of these questions is no then you\nmay have a case. For example, if many of the questions in the\nfinal medical exam test knowledge of basic sciences then the\nexam may not be a valid test. A doctor may not know the ins and\nouts of the Krebs cycle, but he or she may still be able to give\nsensible and evidence based dietary advice to patients. And what\nabout reliability? Test-retest reliability is a good place to start.\nHow many students who passed their final exams in May would\nstill pass them if they were taken again in September? If large\nnumbers of your students would fail in September, then your\nexam is not reliable and your students are probably crammers.\nSo if you are setting an exam, how do you avoid these pitfalls?\nFirstly, make sure that the exam tests what it\u2019s supposed to test. If\nit is a test of whether candidates would make good general\nphysicians then ensure that the questions deal with common\nmedical problems that would be seen on an average take. So most\nof the questions should be on chronic bronchitis rather than\nporphyria, and they should test candidates\u2019 knowledge of the\ndiagnosis and treatment of chronic bronchitis rather than its\npathophysiology or epidemiology. And if you want to stop the\ncrammers concentrate on continual assessment rather than a\nsingle high-stakes exam at the end. It is strange that some people\nare calling for doctors to do an exam to stay on the medical\nregister when universities are increasingly realising that the best\nway of deciding who should get on the register is by regular\nassessment.\nAt BMJ Learning we offer formative assessment; it doesn\u2019t\ncount towards an exam or a degree, and you can repeat the\nmodules as often as you like. One of our most recent modules is\non the diagnosis and treatment of common skin tumours in\nprimary care. It is weak on paraneoplastic pemphigus but strong\non basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and\nmalignant melanoma. There is little hard evidence on the\neffectiveness or otherwise of online learning in medicine, but one\nof the few areas where online learning has been shown to be\neffective is in dermatology and more specifically in the early\ndetection of skin cancer.1 You are welcome to have a look at our\nmodule on www.bmjlearning.com.\nKieran Walsh clinical editor, BMJ Learning\n(bmjlearning@bmjgroup.com)\n1 Harris JM Jr, Salasche SJ, Harris RB.
