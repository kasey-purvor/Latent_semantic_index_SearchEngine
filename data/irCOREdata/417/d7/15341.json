INTRODUCTION\nThe semiconductors AlN, GaN, and InN and their ternary\nalloys have provoked great interest in the last few years. This\ninterest is largely due to their optical properties, which offer\nnumerous applications from full color displays to high den-\nsity storage systems. Research over recent years has led to\nroom temperature blue-violet laser emission in group III ni-\ntride quantum well structures for both pulsed1,2 and continu-\nous wave operation.3\nThe development of devices based on these materials has\nresulted in a demand for their characterization, and experi-\nmental and theoretical studies have established reliable val-\nues for such quantities as lattice parameters4\u20136 and funda-\nmental band gaps,7\u20139 but many other parameters remain\nuncertain. For device modeling, calculations on optical gain\nhave been performed on both bulk and quantum well\nstructures.10\u201312 In particular, the modeling of such devices\nrequires band structure models, and much theoretical re-\nsearch has concentrated on providing these. Of these band\nstructure models, the k\u0095p method13 using six or eight bands\nis one that is especially useful for device modeling. This is\nbecause the computational demands are light compared to\nother methods, such as those based on empirical pseudopo-\ntentials. The k\u0095p approach is known to provide a good de-\nscription of the heavy-hole, light-hole, and crystal field split-\noff bands at the zone center, which are important in any\nconsideration of optical properties. Therefore, there is a need\nto obtain accurate k\u0095p parameters for these wurtzite com-\npounds and their alloys, in order to model current and future\ndevices.\nThe parameters for k\u0095p models must be determined from\neither experimental results or more fundamental calculations.\nSome existing work obtains these parameters indirectly, in\nthat first the effective masses for electrons and holes at the G\npoint are calculated using a parabolic line fit to existing band\nstructure. Then, the k\u0095p parameters are extracted from the\neffective masses using the relations that exist between\nthem.14 The parameters can also be obtained by fitting the\nk\u0095p band structure to that of more sophisticated calculations,\nas in Refs. 15\u201317. In this paper we present a direct calcula-\ntion of the k\u0095p parameters and contrast it with a fitting ap-\nproach. The motivation for this is to demonstrate the differ-\nences between the two methods and highlight the advantages\nof the direct calculation.\nII. EMPIRICAL PSEUDOPOTENTIAL CALCULATIONS\nThe empirical psuedopotential calculations employed here\nuse a local pseudopotential and a basis set consisting of ap-\nproximately 60 plane waves per atom in the unit cell. Spin-\norbit interactions are included using a simplified K3K8 term\n~see, e.g., Ref. 18!, which is adequate given the relatively\nsmall number of plane-waves employed in the calculation. In\npractice, our tests indicate that there are no appreciable dif-\nferences between this scheme and the more sophisticated one\nadopted by, for example, Chelikowsky and Cohen.19\nPseudopotentials for each of the materials were generated\nusing a procedure described in Ref. 20. These pseudopoten-\ntials were generated such that acceptable accuracy was\nachieved in several criteria, the foremost of which was the\nnecessity to have good agreement with known band energies\nat the chosen symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Sec-\nondly, it was required that there was good overall agreement\nbetween the predicted valence band structure and our own\nfirst-principles results obtained using VASP.21\u201323\nIII. k\"p MODEL FOR THE WURTZITE STRUCTURE\nWe adopt a six band k\u0095p model for the top of the valence\nband.

Such terms\nvanish by symmetry in the zinc blende but not the wurtzite\nstructure. In much previous work the parameter A7 has been\nassumed to be zero, but recently it has been shown that its\ninclusion can give an improved description of the valence\nbands.26 The parameter A7 can be evaluated using the for-\nmula\nA75\n2i\\\nm0A2\n^XupxuZ&. ~6!\nTerms linear in k can also appear due to a linear k term in\nthe spin-orbit interaction or through remote band effects of\nthe spin-orbit interaction in association with the k\u0095p term.\nThese terms either vanish or are very small in zinc blende\nmaterials and are expected to be so here as well, particularly\nin view of the very small spin-orbit interaction in the ni-\ntrides. This view is confirmed by the results presented in Sec.\nV.\nIV. CALCULATION OF THE k\"p PARAMETERS\nTwo methods have been used to obtain the parameters for\nthe k\u0095p model. In the first method, the values of the Ai were\nobtained through a simple Monte Carlo fitting procedure to\nthe band structure. The empirical pseudopotential method\nwas used to calculate the band structure at several k points\nover the range shown in Fig. 1. The k\u0095p method was then\nused to calculate the band structure at these same k points,\nusing a set of Ai values. These Ai values were then varied\nusing a Monte Carlo technique, and the process systemati-\ncally repeated until the k\u0095p eigenvalues were in good agree-\nment with those of the empirical pseudopotential calcula-\ntions. In this approach each of the sampling points was given\na weight, with those closer to the zone center typically being\nweighted more than those further away. Additionally, the\nbands themselves were also appropriately weighted.\nIn the second method, the k\u0095p parameters were evaluated\ndirectly from Eqs. ~4!\u2013~6!. To obtain these parameters, 250\nbands are included in each summation in Eq. ~5!. These sums\nare rapidly convergent, with all of the k\u0095p parameters con-\nverged to within 1% of their final value after a summation\nTABLE I. k\u0095p parameters for wurtzite GaN.

RESULTS\nThe calculated values of Ai (i51 \u2013 7) for GaN, together\nwith those from other calculations, are presented in Table I.\nThe values for AlN and InN obtained in this work are shown\nin Table II. The parameters from the two different methods\nwere used in k\u0095p calculations of the band structures of GaN,\nAlN, and InN in the region of interest close to the G point.\nThe resulting band structures are shown in Figs. 1\u20133. Note\nthat AlN has a negative crystal field splitting, and thus the\nordering of the bands is different from that of GaN and InN.\nFor all three materials, both the Monte Carlo fitting approach\nand the direct method produced band structures in very good\nagreement with those of the original empirical pseudopoten-\ntial calculation. In particular, the inclusion of A7 accurately\nmodels the lifting of the degeneracy near the anticrossing\nfeature seen in GaN and InN. Also, note that these bands are\nextremely nonparabolic, and thus obtaining effective masses\n~and subsequently k\u0095p parameters! from them via parabolic\nline fits is not preferable to the methods presented here.\nFrom Tables I and II, it is clear that our parameters ob-\ntained by Monte Carlo fitting and the direct approach are\nsomewhat different from each other for each of the materials.\nFor AlN, the difference in the Ai values is typically about\n10%. For GaN, the agreement is better, with differences at\naround 6%, and for InN the values generally differ by about\n13%. However, despite these differences, both methods give\na very similar quality of fit to the original band structure, as\ncan be concluded from the results shown in Figs. 1\u20133. This\ndemonstrates the potential inconsistency of the fitting\nmethod, in that two different sets of parameters appear to\nresult in equally good agreement with the initial band struc-\nture. Indeed, for the fitting procedure a range of equally valid\nparameter sets exists, and it is because of this that it cannot\nbe relied upon to give consistent k\u0095p parameters for a series\nof alloy compositions. In contrast to the fitting approach, the\nFIG. 2. Band structure close to the zone center for wurtzite\nGaN. See Fig. 1 for an explanation of the notation.\nFIG. 3.

ABRAM\nmethod of obtaining k\u0095p parameters directly from the zone\ncenter wave functions and energies has a firm physical basis\nand presents an unambiguous route to calculating these\nquantities from a given original band structure. Conse-\nquently, this method can be applied to a series of alloy com-\npositions, with the expectation that consistent k\u0095p param-\neters will be obtained.\nIn addition to our own results, Table I also shows the\nk\u0095p parameters that have been reported in the literature by\nother workers. Our results are most similar to those of Yeo et\nal.,14 who also employ an empirical pseudopotential method.\nWe have additionally calculated Ai (i51 \u2013 6) directly using\nthe empirical band structure of Yeo et al. The agreement\nbetween this new set and that originally obtained by Yeo\net al. is fairly good. The other values quoted in Table I are\nbased on first-principles calculations, and while they are\nqualitatively similar to our own results the individual Ai pa-\nrameters can significantly differ. This is to be expected given\nthat our empirical band structure is quite different from the\nfirst-principles band structures used in the fittings for these\nresults.\nOur values in Tables I and II can also be considered with\nrespect to the cubic approximation to the wurtzite\nstructure.16,27 This approximation is based on the similarity\nbetween the zinc blende and wurtzite structures, in that they\nare both tetrahedrally bonded but with different stacking ar-\nrangements. For the cubic approximation, the following re-\nlations can be established between the Luttinger-like param-\neters:\nA15A212A4 ,\nA3522A4 ,\nA314A55A2A6 . ~7!\nAlthough there is no requirement for these relationships to\nbe satisfied in our calculations, we note that substitution of\nthe values of Tables I and II in Eq. ~7! shows that the cubic\napproximation is satisfied approximately. For AlN, compar-\ning the actual value on the left hand side of Eq. ~7! with the\nvalue determined by the right hand side, the relations are\nsatisfied to within 20% for the fitting method and to within\n13% for the direct method. For GaN, the values are within\n13% for the fitting method and 10% for the direct method.\nFor InN, the approximation holds somewhat better, with val-\nues for both methods within about 5% of those predicted.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nTwo methods have been presented to obtain k\u0095p param-\neters from existing empirical pseudopotential band structures\nin wurtzite semiconductors. Obtaining the parameters using a\nMonte Carlo fitting approach gives k\u0095p band structures in\nexcellent agreement with the original empirical band struc-\ntures. The direct technique employed to obtain these param-\neters also produces excellent band structure near the center\nof the Brillouin zone, and has the advantage of producing a\nunique set for a given empirical band structure. Given that\nthis method has a sound theoretical basis, and produces\nk\u0095p band structures of comparable quality, we consider it to\nbe preferable to an arbitrary fitting procedure. It has the par-\nticular advantage of being able to produce consistent sets of\nparameters for studies such as those involving a series of\nalloy compositions.\nWe have therefore constructed sets of k\u0095p parameters for\nwurtzite AlN, GaN, and InN. These results serve as a basis\nfor further work on the electronic structure of alloys of vary-\ning compositions for calculations of optical properties and\ndevice modeling.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to EPSRC for funding this re-\nsearch through a research grant and the provision of financial\nsupport for D.J.D. We also thank Dr. R. A. Coles for useful\ndiscussions.\n*Electronic address: D.J.Dugdale@durham.ac.uk\n1 I. Akasaki, H. Amano, S. Sota, H. Sakai, T. Tanaka, and M.\nKaike, Jpn. J. Appl.
