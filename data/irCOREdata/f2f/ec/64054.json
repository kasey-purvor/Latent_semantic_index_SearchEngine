A historical record of sea ice from the northern Weddell Sea shows that the negative \nrelationship between MSA and winter sea ice exists over interannual (~7 year period), and \nmulti-decadal (~20 year period) time scales.

Introduction 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n[2] Sea ice is believed to be a vital component in the regional climate and circulation systems of \nAntarctica [Cavalieri et al., 1997; Parkinson, 2004], and also influences ecosystem productivity \naround the continent [Atkinson et al., 2004].  Systematic satellite measurements of Antarctic sea ice \nfirst began in 1973, however the detection of any long-term changes in these sea ice records is \nhindered by their relatively short time span and the strong interannual to decadal variability of \nAntarctic sea ice [Cavalieri et al., 1997; Curran et al., 2003; Parkinson, 2004].  Longer, but \nregionally sparse, historical records do provide some evidence for a long-term decline in Antarctic \nsea ice during the 20th century [de la Mare, 1997; Murphy et al., 1995; Rayner et al., 2003].  \nHowever, it remains unclear how these changes may have been linked to observational records of \n20th century climate change in Antarctica [Cook et al., 2005; Vaughan et al., 2003].  In turn, it is \nstill not clear to what extent Antarctic sea ice may play a role in future changes in climate, both in \nAntarctica and globally.  To address these issues a proxy for reconstructing past sea ice conditions \nis needed.       \n \n[3] Antarctic ice cores are valuable archives of palaeoenvironmental conditions, and ice core \nrecords of both sea salt and methanesulphonic acid (MSA; CH3SO3H) have been proposed as \npotential proxies for sea ice [Welch et al., 1993; Wolff et al., 2003]. Sea salt in ice cores has \ntraditionally been viewed as a proxy for transport strength and storminess.  However, the \nobservation of increased sea salt in Antarctic ice cores during winter, and during glacial periods, has \nrecently led to suggestions that sea salt may instead reflect the formation of brine and frost flowers \non top of new sea ice [Wolff et al., 2003].  Whilst ice core records of sea salt appear to respond to \nsea ice changes over long time scales (e.g. glacial-interglacial; [Wolff et al., 2006]), this proxy has \nnot yet been shown to be sensitive to sea ice production over interannual to century time scales.  \nThe other potential sea ice proxy, MSA, is derived ultimately from marine phytoplankton \nproductivity at the sea ice margin [Kawaguchi et al., 2005].  During spring and summer, the decay \n 3 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nof sea ice enhances the activity of these phytoplankton that produce dimethylsulphide (DMS; \n(CH3)2S) [Curran and Jones, 2000].  DMS is released to the atmosphere where it is rapidly oxidised \nto form MSA [Ravishankara et al., 1997].  This is the only known source of MSA in Antarctic ice \ncores, leading to theories that MSA records from near-coastal ice cores could provide \nreconstructions of past biological activity and sea ice conditions [Curran et al., 2003; Saigne and \nLegrand, 1987].   \n \n[4] Comparisons of Antarctic ice core MSA records with instrumental records of sea ice have \nproduced varying results.  For example, an MSA record from Dolleman Island on the eastern \nAntarctic Peninsula was found to have a negative correlation with a historic record of winter sea ice \nduration at the South Orkney Islands [Pasteur et al., 1995].  A negative correlation was also found \nbetween an MSA record from Lambert Glacier [Sun et al., 2002] and more recent satellite records \nof winter sea ice area in the Indian Ocean sector.  In contrast, positive correlations have been \nidentified between regional satellite records of annual sea ice area and ice core MSA from Newell \nGlacier [Welch et al., 1993] and, more recently, between winter sea ice extent and MSA at Law \nDome [Curran et al., 2003].  The Law Dome study found that strong decadal cycles in sea ice \nextent had masked long-term changes in the relatively short satellite records, and the ice core MSA \nresults were used to infer that winter sea ice extent in the Law Dome region had decreased by \naround 20% since the 1950s [Curran et al., 2003].     \n \n[5] The potential for sea ice reconstructions that was demonstrated by the Law Dome MSA \nrecord now needs to be tested at other locations.  The varying results of earlier studies suggest that \nthe link between ice core MSA records and sea ice is not the same at all sites around Antarctica, and \naccordingly not all ice core MSA records may be suitable as sea ice proxies.  In this study we use \nthe MSA records of three near-coastal ice cores from sites around the Weddell Sea to examine \nMSA-sea ice relationships in a region with a distinctly different sea ice regime to the Law Dome \n 4 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nsite (Fig. 1).  The sea ice-MSA relationship in the Weddell Sea region is first examined using a \nrange of sea ice parameters from post-1973 satellite records of sea ice.  The natural variability of \nMSA and sea ice in this region are then further assessed using a historical record of sea ice duration \nfrom the northern Weddell Sea that begins in 1903.  This study thus allows for a detailed evaluation \nof the nature and drivers of MSA variability in the Weddell Sea region and, in turn, the factors that \nneed to be considered in assessing the suitability of Antarctic ice core MSA records as sea ice \nproxies.    \n \n \n2.  Ice core sites and analysis \n[6] The ice cores used in this study were collected by the British Antarctic Survey from three \nsites around the margin of the Weddell Sea (Table 1; Fig.1); Dolleman Island [Pasteur et al., 1995], \nBerkner Island [Mulvaney et al., 2002] and Dronning Maud Land (DML).  Snow accumulation at \nthese sites is generally associated with low pressure systems that have either tracked across the \nWeddell Sea from the southern Atlantic Ocean, or that have developed over the Weddell Sea due to \nblocking by the Antarctic Peninsula [Noone et al., 1999; Reijmer et al., 1999; Reijmer and van den \nBroeke, 2000; Russell et al., 2004].  Backwards trajectory analysis shows that the Dolleman Island \nsite, on the western margin of the Weddell Sea, is also influenced by air masses that have travelled \nover the Antarctic Peninsula from the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas and the southern Pacific \nOcean [Russell et al., 2004].    \n \n[7] The ice cores were shipped frozen to the United Kingdom where they were subsampled \nusing a bandsaw that had been cleaned with frozen ultra-pure water.  The Dolleman Island core was \nsubsampled at a resolution of approximately 12 samples per year.  Following high-resolution \nanalysis of major ions, aliquots of the Dolleman Island subsamples were combined to produce \nannual samples for MSA analysis [Mulvaney and Peel, 1988; Pasteur et al., 1995].   Subsampling \n 5 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nof the Berkner Island core was carried out at annual resolution, as defined by electrical conductivity \nmeasurements (ECM).  The DML core was subsampled at psuedo-annual resolution based on \nmodern day snow accumulation rates and ice densification modelling.  The chronologies of each of \nthe cores were further constrained using volcanic stratigraphic markers recorded in non-sea salt \nSO42- and electrical profiles, and \u03b2-radioactivity peaks caused by nuclear weapons testing [Hofstede \net al., 2004; Mulvaney et al., 2002].  In the case of the DML core these fixed stratigraphic markers \nwere used to refine the ice densification model for this site and provide more reliable age estimates \nfor the pseudo-annual samples.  For the purposes of this study, the DML data was then linearly \ninterpolated to provide an annually averaged timeseries.  It is estimated that the annual dating of the \nice cores is accurate to \u00b1 1 year during the satellite era (post 1973), and accurate to within \u00b1 2 years \nback to the start of the 20th century. \n \n[8] In the Berkner Island and Dolleman Island cores the annual samples defined by ECM and \nmajor ion analyses run from winter to winter, and are thus centred around the austral summer peak \nof MSA [Minikin et al., 1998].  The interpolated annual averages of the DML data are also centred \non the austral summer, and any signal smoothing caused by the original pseudo-annual sampling \nmethod should not significantly affect the interannual variability examined in this study.  MSA has \nbeen shown to experience post-depositional loss in snow, and further diffusional movement in ice \n[Mulvaney et al., 1992].  Interpreting interannual variations in MSA as an environmental signal uses \nthe assumption that post-depositional MSA loss in the snow pack remains approximately constant \nover time, and so does not disturb the ice core MSA anomaly related to environmental processes \n[Fundel et al., 2006].  Later disturbance of the environmental MSA signal due to migration in ice \nappears to be restricted to sub-annual scales in late Holocene ice cores [Curran et al., 2002; Pasteur \nand Mulvaney, 2000], and thus MSA migration should not be a significant source of error for the \nannual MSA samples used in this study.  MSA was measured for the Weddell region ice core \n 6 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nsamples by ion-chromotography, using Dionex instruments and columns.  Typical precision of the \nMSA measurements using this system is \u00b15%.     \n \n \n3.  The satellite era (post-1973) \n3.1  Satellite sea ice datasets \n[9] The first sea ice dataset used to examine MSA-sea ice relationships in the Weddell region \nice cores was derived from Joint Ice Centre (JIC) maps.  These maps show the latitude of the sea ice \nedge (defined as 15% sea ice cover) for 10 degree sectors of longitude around Antarctica.  The JIC \nmaps record weekly sea ice extents (SIE) from 1973 to 1996, and have been compiled into monthly \nSIE summaries [Jacka, 1990].   \n \n[10] The other satellite sea ice dataset used in this study is derived from NASA scanning \nmultichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR; 1978 \u2013 1987) and special sensor microwave\/imager \n(SSM\/I; 1987 \u2013 1998) instruments [Comiso, 1999; Zwally et al., 2002]. The NASA sea ice data \nbegin almost six years after the JIC records, and thus the period for calibrating with the ice core \nMSA records is shorter.  The NASA dataset used here also does not have the same longitudinal \nresolution as the JIC data, instead being compiled into 5 broad regional areas around Antarctica \n[Zwally et al., 2002].  However, the NASA data are based upon cumulative sea ice conditions \nthroughout the sea ice pack and, unlike the Jacka\/JIC data, are able to incorporate features such as \nopen water areas within the ice pack and latitudinally-oblique ice edge geometry that exist in the \nAntarctic Peninsula and Weddell Sea regions.  In the NASA dataset, SIE is defined as the \ncumulative area of all grid cells having at least 15% sea ice concentration, while ice covered area \n(ICA) is the sum of area multiplied by sea ice concentration for each grid cell [Zwally et al., 2002].  \nIn this study we use the bootstrap algorithm version of the NASA sea ice data as this has been \n 7 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nshown to produce the best fit between satellite and sonar sea ice data for the Weddell Sea \n[Connolley, 2005]. \n \n[11] Theories of the MSA-sea ice relationship involve phytoplankton blooms that occur during \nthe break-up of winter sea ice.  Following the method of Curran et al. [2003], August-October \naverages of the satellite sea ice data were used to define the winter maxima in sea ice conditions \n(SIEmax and ICAmax).  These winter sea ice conditions were then compared with annual averages of \nice core MSA centred on the following austral summer.  However, the persistence of sea ice \nthroughout summer in the Weddell Sea means that the winter maximum in sea ice may not be best \nmeasure for examining MSA-sea ice relationships in this region.  Because of this we also compared \nour ice core MSA records to time series of the January-March minimum in sea ice conditions \n(SIEmin and ICAmin), and to the amount of sea ice decay each year (decay = max \u2013 min).    \n \n3.2  Features of the post-1973 ice core MSA records \n[12] The three ice core records from the Weddell Sea region exhibit a large range in mean MSA \nconcentrations (Table 1).  In the post-1973 period (satellite era) the DML core has a mean \nconcentration of 4.9 \u03bcg\/kg (ppb), which is similar to that of the Law Dome ice core record (6.5 ppb; \n[Curran et al., 2003]).  Mean MSA concentrations rise to 16.6 ppb for the Berkner Island core and \nto 55.4 ppb for the Dolleman Island core.  It has previously been suggested that the exceptionally \nhigh MSA concentrations in Dolleman Island ice reflect a large local source of MSA to this site \n[Mulvaney et al., 1992; Pasteur et al., 1995].  The decrease in MSA concentration with increasing \naltitude and distance from the coast that is observed in these three ice cores (Table 1) is not an \nunexpected result, as atmospheric concentrations of MSA can decrease by a factor of two over \ntransport distances of a few hundred kilometres [Minikin et al., 1998; Minikin et al., 1994].  \n \n 8 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n[13] Despite differences in mean MSA concentrations, the three ice core MSA records show \nsimilar patterns of interannual variability during the satellite era (Fig. 2a).    In order to reduce the \neffects of noise in the individual ice core records and better isolate the common regional MSA \nsignal, the three ice core MSA records were normalised and then averaged to produce a single post-\n1973 stacked MSA record for the Weddell Sea region (Fig. 2b).  Interannual variability in the MSA \nrecords was compared with the satellite records of sea ice using linear correlation analysis.  \nSignificance levels for the correlations were estimated using a 2-tailed t-test, with an AR(1) \npersistence correction for effective sample size [von Storch and Zwiers, 1999]. \n \n3.3  Correlation of ice core MSA with satellite sea ice records \n[14] The three individual ice core MSA records all show negative correlations with the winter \nmaximum in sea ice conditions in the Weddell Sea (i.e. increased MSA corresponds to reduced \nwinter sea ice; Fig. 3b; Table 2).  This negative correlation is strongest for the Berkner Island and \nDML cores, where negative correlation values persist across the entire Weddell Sea sector.  For the \nDolleman Island MSA record, the negative correlation is observed only at the western margin of the \nWeddell Sea (Fig. 3b).  The common negative relationship between ice core MSA and winter sea \nice becomes clearer using the stacked MSA record.  Using the JIC data (Fig. 3a) negative \ncorrelations are observed with winter sea ice extents throughout the Weddell Sea, with the \ncorrelation peaking between 0-10\u00baW (r = -0.50).  This finding is confirmed using the NASA sea ice \ndataset for the Weddell Sea sector, where significant negative correlations are observed for winter \nsea ice extent and area (Table 2; rSIE = -0.76, rICA = -0.78).  It is important to note that this negative \nrelationship between ice core MSA and winter sea ice in the Weddell Sea region is opposite to the \npositive regional correlations produced by this method for the Law Dome\/western Pacific sector of \nAntarctica [Curran et al., 2003].   \n \n 9 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n[15] The Weddell region MSA records do, however, show significant positive correlations with \nwinter sea ice in the more distant Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas.  Using the JIC winter sea ice \nextent data this positive correlation is found to peak at 90-100\u00baW (Fig. 3a; r = +0.62).  Similar \nresults are again produced using the NASA winter sea ice data for the Amundsen-Bellingshausen \nSea sector (Table 2; rSIE = 0.62, rICA = 0.62).   \n \n[16] Comparison of the ice core MSA records with the summer sea ice minimum and with sea ice \ndecay do not produce strong, regional correlation patterns like those observed with the winter sea \nice maximum.  Summer sea ice in both the Weddell Sea and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas has \ngenerally positive correlations with our ice core MSA records, however these correlations are not \nstatistically significant (Fig. 3c).  Sea ice decay produces the same correlation pattern as observed \nusing the winter sea ice maximum (i.e. negative correlations in the Weddell Sea, positive \ncorrelations in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas; Fig 3d), however the overall correlations are \nnot as strong or regionally extensive as observed for winter sea ice.  The negative correlations \nbetween the NASA record of sea ice decay in the Weddell Sea and the stacked MSA record are \nstatistically significant (rSIE = -0.67, rICA = -0.68; 95% confidence level), but are weaker than the \ncorrelations produced using the winter sea ice maximum.   Hence, it appears that at a regional scale \nthe winter maximum in sea ice shows the strongest relationship to MSA in Weddell region ice \ncores. \n \n \n3.4  Interpretation of post-1973 MSA-sea ice relationships in the Weddell Sea region \n[17] Over the time period covered by satellite sea ice measurements the Weddell region MSA \nrecords consistently show a negative correlation with winter sea ice in the Weddell Sea, and \npositive correlations with winter sea ice in the more distal Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas.  The \nmain source region for MSA in the Weddell Sea region ice cores is unlikely to be the Amundsen-\n 10 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nBellingshausen Seas as the Antarctic Peninsula acts as a barrier to westerly near-surface \natmospheric transport [Orr et al., 2004; Parish, 1983].  Backwards trajectory analysis confirms that \nmost of the weather systems affecting the Weddell-region ice core sites have travelled from the \nSouthern Atlantic Ocean across the Weddell Sea [Noone et al., 1999; Reijmer et al., 1999; Reijmer \nand van den Broeke, 2000; Russell et al., 2004].  An exception to this is the Dolleman Island site \nwhere airmasses from the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas also contribute to snowfall [Russell et \nal., 2004].  However, MSA experiences a rapid decrease in concentration during atmospheric \ntransport [Minikin et al., 1998] and the very high concentrations of MSA in the Dolleman Island \ncore suggest that MSA is primarily sourced from the adjacent Weddell Sea [Pasteur et al., 1995].  It \nis likely instead that the positive correlations observed between the Weddell region MSA records \nand sea ice in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas are an artefact of the strong inverse relationship \nbetween sea ice conditions on the eastern and western sides of the Antarctic Peninsula [Lefebvre \nand Goosse, in press; Yuan and Martinson, 2001].  Indeed, the NASA sea ice datasets show that \nnegative correlations at greater than 95% confidence exist between winter sea ice conditions in the \nWeddell Sea and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas.   \n \n[18] Thus it appears that in recent decades the amount of MSA deposited at our ice core sites has \nbeen reduced during years when winter sea ice has been more extensive in the Weddell Sea.  This \nnegative correlation is opposite to the relationship expected if MSA is to be used as a proxy for \nwinter sea ice [Curran et al., 2003].  This could potentially be due to the extensive summer sea ice \nregime of the Weddell Sea, and the influence that this has on the area available for MSA production \nand the transport distance to the coast.  In the Law Dome region these additional effects on the \nMSA-sea ice relationship are small as sea ice experiences a near complete retreat to the coast each \nyear.  However, their influence can still be seen when the Law Dome MSA record is compared with \nthe NASA sea ice dataset for the western Pacific sector (90\u00baE \u2013 160\u00baE).  The correlation with SIEmax \nin this sector produces a positive correlation with an r-value of 0.45.  When the MSA record is \n 11 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \ncompared with SIEdecay (i.e. the influence of reduced MSA production area due to summer sea ice is \naccounted for) the positive correlation between ice core MSA and sea ice is increased to 0.60.  The \nnegative influence of summer sea ice on the MSA record, both through decreasing the size of the \nproduction area and through increasing MSA loss by increasing the transport distance, is also \nevident in the strong negative correlation between Law Dome MSA and SIEmin in the western \nPacific sector (r = -0.65).  \n \n[19] In the Weddell Sea region we observe a significant negative correlation between ice core \nMSA and sea ice decay.  However, this relationship is not as strong as the negative correlations \nproduced using the winter sea ice maximum.  This reduced significance could be viewed as a slight \nshift towards the expected positive MSA-sea ice relationship (i.e. more Law Dome-like) when the \ninfluence of MSA production area is taken into account.  However, it is clear that variations in the \narea available for MSA production are not the dominant environmental signal being recorded by the \nWeddell-region ice core records.  Likewise, the lack of a significant correlation with the summer \nsea ice minimum indicates that MSA loss during transport over the summer ice pack does not \nstrongly influence the interannual variability of MSA in our ice core records.  The similarity of the \ncorrelation results produced using measures of both sea ice extent and ice covered area also \nsuggests that variations in MSA production from within the ice pack are unlikely to be a critical \nfactor controlling the MSA signal in ice cores from this region. \n \n[20] Thus, an issue remains that during the satellite era the most significant and regionally \nconsistent correlations found between our ice core MSA records and sea ice in the Weddell Sea are \nthe negative correlations with the winter maximum in sea ice.  There is no direct relationship to \nexplain why MSA is reduced at our ice core sites following winters of more extensive sea ice, and it \nis also clear that this unexpected relationship cannot be explained by the influence of the summer \nsea ice pack on MSA production area and transport distance.  Instead, it may be that the processes \n 12 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nthat affect sea ice conditions in the Weddell Sea (such as temperature and wind direction) also \ninfluence the delivery of MSA to our ice core sites.  This issue is examined further in section 4.3.2.   \n \n4. The 20th century \n4.1  Correlations with a historical sea ice record \n[21] The existence of a historical sea ice record from the northern Weddell Sea allows for a \nunique opportunity to further test the nature of MSA-sea ice relationships in this region over a much \nlonger time frame than possible using satellite sea ice records.  This historical record provides an \nindex of sea ice duration (SID) from the South Orkney Islands [Murphy et al., 1995] (Fig. 1; Fig. 4).  \nThe dataset begins in 1903 and is derived from station measurements of the duration of fast-ice at \nFactory Cove (Signy Island) and Scotia Bay (Laurie Island).  SID at the South Orkney Islands is \nstrongly related to the advance and retreat of the Weddell Sea ice pack around the islands each \nwinter.  Comparison with satellite sea ice records shows that the South Orkney SID index reflects \nthe larger-scale winter sea ice conditions of the Weddell Sea [Murphy et al., 1995], and thus \nprovides a reliable reconstruction of regional sea ice changes during the pre-satellite era. \n \n[22] Correlations between the ice core MSA records and South Orkney SID were examined using \na block bootstrap resampling method (PearsonT software; [Mudelsee, 2003]).  The bootstrap \nmethod involved resampling the bivariate time series to produce simulated time series of the same \nlength, and calculating correlation coefficients for each simulation.  By resampling blocks of \nlinearly detrended data persistence over the block length was preserved.  Block lengths were \nselected using the serial correlations of the time series [Mudelsee, 2003].  Correlation coefficients \nare quoted with a 95% confidence interval, calculated from 2000 bootstrap simulations.  \nCorrelations are significantly different from zero at the 95% level when the confidence interval does \nnot include zero. \n \n 13 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n[23] Each of the individual ice core MSA records has a negative correlation with the South \nOrkney SID record (rDolleman Is. = -0.24 [-0.41,-0.05]; rBerkner Is. = -0.11 [-0.31,0.10]; rDML = -0.23 [-\n0.40,-0.04]).  A Weddell-region stacked MSA record was again constructed to enhance the common \nregional MSA signal, by averaging the three individual records after they had been normalised over \ntheir common 1900-1990 period (Fig. 4a).  This stacked MSA record has an improved negative \ncorrelation with South Orkney SID (r = -0.34 [-0.50,-0.18]).  A moving correlation analysis, using \n21-year sliding correlation windows, further shows that the strength of this relationship has not been \nconstant through time (Fig. 4c).  Instead, the negative relationship between the Weddell-region \nstacked MSA record and South Orkney SID was strongest prior to ~1945 and after ~1975.   \n \n4.2  Spectral analysis \n[24] Visual examination of the 20th century SID and MSA records suggests that there may be \nsome quasi-periodic variability within these records (Fig. 4; [Murphy et al., 1995]).  To further \nexamine the variability of MSA and sea ice in the Weddell Sea region, we first carried out spectral \nanalysis on the full 20th century MSA and SID records using the Lomb\u2013Scargle fourier transform \ncombined with the Welch-overlapped-segment-averaging procedure ([Schulz and Stattegger, 1997]; \nresults verified using multitaper spectral estimation [Percival and Walden, 1993]).  An AR(1) red-\nnoise model was used to test spectral significance (REDFIT software; [Schulz and Mudelsee, \n2002]).  The South Orkney SID record shows spectral peaks exceeding the upper 90% chi-squared \nred noise level at periodicities of approximately 20 years and 7 years (Fig. 5a).  The Weddell-region \nstacked MSA record also shows evidence for spectral power at ~20 year and ~7 year periods, \nhowever these peaks fall below 90% significance when the spectra are calculated over the whole \n20th century period.  The stacked MSA record does display a significant spectral peak at an ~4 year \nperiod.  The South Orkney SID record also shows some evidence for spectral power at an ~4 year \nperiod, but below the 90% threshold level.   \n \n 14 \n[25] Wavelet power spectra [Torrence and Compo, 1998] were also used to examine the time \nevolution of spectral variance in the Weddell Sea region MSA and sea ice records (Fig. 5b,c).  The \nMSA and SID records show clear similarities in their spectral evolution.  In particular, both records \nshow similar time periods where variance at ~4 year,  ~7 year and ~20 year periods was significant.   \nThere are also clear changes in the amount of variance in each of these bands though the 20th \ncentury, which would account for their sometimes low significance when spectral analysis was \napplied over the full 20th century records (Fig. 5a).  In order to better evaluate the MSA-sea ice \nrelationships at these shared periodicities, Gaussian filters were applied to each of the Weddell Sea \nregion MSA and sea ice datasets (Analyseries software; [Paillard et al., 1996]; results verified with \nthe Ferraz-Mello filter algorithm using TIMEFRQ software [Schulz et al., 1999]).  The frequency \nrange for filtering was targeted to isolate variability in the ~4 year, ~7 year, and ~20 year bands \nidentified from the spectral analysis results (Fig. 5).  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n[26] Filtering around the ~4 year period (3.8 \u2013 5.3 year range) shows that there are similarities \nbetween the variability at this period in the stacked MSA record and South Orkney SID (Fig. 6a).  \nIn particular both filtered records show that variability at a period of ~4 years was strongest \nbetween ~1945 \u2013 1970.  Variability at this time scale is particularly strong at the Dolleman Island \nsite, accounting for 26% of the total variance in this record, and the power of this periodicity \nappears to decrease with increasing distance from the coast (Table 3).  It should also be noted that \nwhilst the Weddell-region stacked MSA record shows similarities with SID variability at this time \nscale, the ~4-year filters of the individual MSA records show little correspondence between each \nother, in terms of both phasing and amplitude changes.  \n \n[27] In contrast, variance in each of the Weddell-region MSA records at a period of ~7 years (5.9 \n\u2013 8.3 year range; Fig. 6b) shows a clear correspondence with changes in SID.  Generally it is seen \nthat the amplitude of variance in this frequency band was low between ~1925 \u2013 1965, followed by a \n 15 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nperiod of high amplitude variance between ~1965 \u2013 1990 (i.e. the satellite era).  In this frequency \nband each of the MSA records has a negative correlation with SID, in agreement with our earlier \ncorrelation results.  Variance on this time scale is strongest at the Berkner Island site (23% \nvariance), which also has the strongest individual correlation with SID in this frequency band \n(Table 3).  \n \n[28] At periods of ~20 years (16.7 \u2013 33.3 year range; Fig. 6c) the Weddell-region stacked MSA \nrecord again retains a negative correlation with SID.  This negative correspondence is also observed \nin the Dolleman Island and DML records, however the Berkner Island record shows no clear \ncorrespondence with SID at this time scale.  It also appears that the amount of variance in this \nfrequency band is higher in the ice core MSA records than in the South Orkney SID record (Table \n3). \n \n4.3  Processes influencing Weddell Sea region MSA and sea ice \n4.3.1 Variance at a period of ~4 years \n[29] Variance with a period of ~4 years is a common feature of recent Antarctic climate records.  \nSometimes referred to as the quasi-quadrennial cycle [Venegas and Drinkwater, 2001], it is a noted \nfeature of the Antarctic Dipole [Fundel et al., 2006; Venegas et al., 2001; Yuan and Martinson, \n2001] and the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave [White and Peterson, 1996], and may be the result of \nENSO teleconnections in the Amundsen Sea region of Antarctica [Yuan, 2004].  In the Weddell Sea \nthe quasi-quadrennial cycle is evident as a circulation of sea ice anomalies around the Weddell Gyre \n[Venegas and Drinkwater, 2001].  Whilst all of the Weddell-region MSA records display significant \nvariance at periods of ~4 years, their filtered records differ considerably from each other at this \ntimescale.  The local nature of the quasi-quadrennial sea ice anomaly as it propagates around the \nWeddell Gyre would be expected to result in different representations of this signal at different sites \naround the basin.  Furthermore, the localised impact of the quasi-quadrennial cycle would also \n 16 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \naccount for the decreasing contribution that variance at this frequency makes to the individual ice \ncore records as distance from the coast increases (Table 3).  The apparent strengthening of the \nWeddell Sea quasi-quadrennial cycle between ~1945 \u2013 1970 (Fig. 6a) may also have contributed to \nthe reduced correlation between the South Orkney SID and stacked MSA records during this \ninterval (Fig. 4c). \n \n4.3.2 Variance at a period of ~7 years \n[30] The ~7 year cycle has been noted previously in the later decades of South Orkney SID \nrecord [Murphy et al., 1995]. It has also been identified in spectral analysis of reanalysis sea level \npressure data throughout the Southern Ocean [Fischer et al., 2004].  Variability at a period of ~7 \nyears is also a feature of the multivariate chemical record of the Siple Dome ice core, which is \nsensitive to changes in the strength of the low pressure feature over the Amundsen Sea [Kreutz et \nal., 2000].  The filtering results for this frequency band clearly show that changes in SID and MSA \nin the Weddell region are linked in both phase (negative) and amplitude (Fig. 6b).  It is also clear \nthat variance at a period of ~7 years has not been significant in the Weddell Sea region for the \nwhole of the 20th century (Fig. 5).  Instead, variability at this time scale appears to have only \ndominated Weddell Sea climate between ~1965 \u2013 1990 (Fig. 6b), and thus forms the basis of the \nnegative MSA-winter sea ice relationship identified during the satellite era. \n \n[31] The strong variability in the ~7 year cycle during the NCEP\/NCAR reanalysis period \n[Kalnay et al., 1996; Marshall and Harangozo, 2000] allows for the possibility to examine the \nsource of this signal using composite climate anomaly maps.  Based on the peaks and troughs in the \n~7-year filter of the MSA and SID records composite climate anomaly maps from three years of \nhigh sea ice\/low MSA conditions were compared to three years of low sea ice\/high MSA conditions \n(Fig. 7).  During high sea ice\/low MSA years the mean sea level pressure (MSLP) maps show a \nstrengthened Amundsen Sea low pressure anomaly, and a blocking ridge of anomalously high \n 17 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \npressure extending along the Antarctic Peninsula and across the Drake Passage.  During low sea \nice\/high MSA years anomalously high pressure surrounds most of the Antarctic continent, including \nan anomalous increase in pressure over the Weddell Sea\/southern Atlantic Ocean.   \n \n[32] The associated meridional wind and surface air temperature anomalies (Fig. 7) provide clues \nas to why MSA and winter sea ice in the Weddell region have a negative correlation in the ~7 year \nspectral band.  During high sea ice\/low MSA years anomalous cooling of the Weddell Sea appears \nto result from strengthened southerly (offshore) wind flow from the Antarctic continent across the \ncentral Weddell Sea towards the South Orkney Islands.  This scenario would be expected to \nincrease sea ice extent due to cooler temperatures and enhanced northward wind drift, and is \nconsistent with a recent analysis of the atmospheric conditions associated with increased sea ice \nextent in the Weddell Sea region [Lefebvre and Goosse, in press].  At the same time anomalously \nstrong offshore winds would reduce MSA transport to the ice core sites.  Conversely, during low \nsea ice\/high MSA years the composite maps show anomalous wind fields driven by the high \npressure anomaly in the South Atlantic Ocean that direct warm air in a northerly (onshore) direction \nacross the western Weddell Sea.  This situation would be expected to thermodynamically and \ndynamically reduce sea ice extent, while also enhancing MSA transport from the Weddell Sea \ntowards the ice core sites.  It appears that the mountainous barrier of the Antarctic Peninsula \n[Parish, 1983] acts to focus these meridional wind anomalies across the Ronne\/Filchner Ice Shelf \nand Berkner Island, which may explain why variance at an ~7 year periodicity is strongest in the \nBerkner Island MSA record.   \n \n[33] The climate anomaly maps also show strong anomalies in the Amundsen Sea region, \nconsistent with the presence of ~7 year periodicities in the Siple Dome ice core [Kreutz et al., \n2000].  It is also interesting to note that our wavelet spectra and filtering results suggest that \nvariance at this period was weak between ~1925 \u2013 1965 as this corresponds to a period when \n 18 \ninterannual variability of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was also weak [Torrence and \nWebster, 1999].   \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \n4.3.3 Variance at a period of ~20 years \n[34] A similar analysis of the source of the negative MSA-sea ice relationship at an ~ 20 year \nperiod is precluded because this longer period variance is not significant (Fig. 5b and 5c) during the \ntime when the NCEP\/NCAR reanalysis data is reliable for the Southern Ocean [Kalnay et al., 1996; \nMarshall and Harangozo, 2000].  Variance with a period of ~20 years is difficult to detect in \ninstrumental records from Antarctica due to its long period with respect to the length of climate \nrecords.  However, proxy records from Antarctica and beyond do commonly show variance at ~20 \nyear periodicities.  Sea salt records from the Siple Dome and Law Dome ice cores contain \nsignificant variance at periods near 20 years, and have both been interpreted as proxies for \natmospheric transport changes, associated with MSLP variations that may be part of the Southern \nAnnual Mode [Goodwin et al., 2004; Kreutz et al., 2000].  In these studies it was also noted that \n~20 year periodicities are found in the spectra of southern hemisphere tree-ring records sensitive to \nmid-latitude temperatures and MSLP, suggesting that this variability may be related to a \nhemispheric-scale climatic process.  Whilst the climate anomaly maps shown for the ~7 year \nperiodicity may not be directly comparable to the processes associated with the ~20 year \nperiodicity, the negative relationship that persists between the Weddell-region MSA and sea ice \nrecords at these long time scales suggests that wind direction and air temperature anomalies are \nlikely to have continued to synergistically increase (decrease) sea ice while also decreasing \n(increasing) the transport of MSA to the ice core sites around the Weddell Sea.    \n \n5.  Implications for MSA reconstructions of sea ice \n[35] Our comparison of ice core MSA records with satellite sea ice indices since 1973 indicates \nthat the MSA signal retained in near-coastal ice cores around the Weddell Sea shows the strongest \n 19 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \nand most regionally consistent correlations with the winter sea ice maximum in the Weddell Sea \nsector.  These correlations show that years of increased sea ice cover are associated with reduced \nMSA in Weddell Sea region ice core records.  This is opposite to the relationship expected if MSA \nis to be used as a sea ice proxy [Curran et al., 2003], and this difference can not be accounted for by \nthe effect of the summer sea ice pack in the Weddell Sea on MSA production area and transport \ndistance.   \n \n[36] Our comparison with a longer historical record of sea ice from the South Orkney Islands \nconfirms the negative relationship that exists with MSA in this region, and identifies characteristic \nvariability at ~4 year, ~7 year, and ~20 year periods in the MSA and sea ice records of this region.  \nWhilst variability at a period of ~4 years is common to all of the MSA records, its expression is \nquite varied between the individual ice core records suggesting that it may be associated with quasi-\nquadrennial cycling of local sea ice anomalies around the Weddell Gyre.  Variance at the longer ~7 \nyear and ~20 year periods is more consistent between the individual sites, and shows negative \ncorrelations with winter sea ice duration at the South Orkney Islands.  Reanalysis climate anomaly \nmaps suggest that the negative correlation between sea ice and MSA at the ~7 year period is due to \nan indirect connection, whereby anomalous cold (warm) air flowing offshore (onshore) across the \nWeddell Sea acts to increase (decrease) sea ice extent while also decreasing (increasing) the \ntransport of MSA to the ice core sites.  A similar examination of the processes associated with \nvariability at an ~20 year period is precluded by the short time span over which the reanalysis data \nremains reliable for the South Ocean, however the continued negative relationship between MSA \nand sea ice at this time period suggests that a similar indirect link via wind and air temperature \nanomalies is likely.   \n \n[37] Hence our detailed analysis of ice core MSA records from the Weddell Sea region of \nAntarctica has shown that in this region ice core MSA records are not a suitable proxy for directly \n 20 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \nreconstructing past sea ice conditions.  The indirect connection between these records does, \nhowever, result in a significant inverse relationship between MSA and sea ice that may have \npotential for indirectly inferring past sea ice changes in this region.  The dominant connection \nbetween MSA and onshore\/offshore wind strength observed in our Weddell Sea region ice core \nrecords appears to also extend further eastward across Dronning Maud Land where a recent study of \nsnow pit and ice core MSA records found that increased MSA concentrations were associated with \nmore efficient atmospheric transport [Fundel et al., 2006].  The pronounced influence that \nonshore\/offshore wind strength appears to have on ice core MSA records in this part of Antarctica is \nperhaps related to the embayed nature of the Weddell Sea, with the mountainous ridge of the \nAntarctic Peninsula acting to focus wind anomalies in a north-south direction.   \n \n[38] Overall, the potential for ice core MSA records from different sites to reflect sea ice \nconditions or atmospheric transport strength (or some combination of both) means that great care is \nneeded in assessing their potential to act as proxy records.  A multi-proxy approach may help to \nresolve these issues, with the combined analysis of MSA and other possible chemical indicators of \nsea ice and atmospheric transport potentially providing a means for assessing the processes \ndominating observed variability in networks of ice core MSA records from other sites around \nAntarctica.      \n 21 \nAcknowledgments 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \nWe thank Mark Curran for making the Law Dome MSA data available for comparison, and for \nhelpful discussions about the interpretation of MSA as a sea ice proxy, and Eugene Murphy for \nproviding the South Orkney SID dataset. \n 22 \nReferences \nAtkinson, A., V.

Comparison of ice core MSA records from the Weddell Sea region with sea ice duration \nat the South Orkney Islands.  (a) A stacked Weddell-region MSA record was produced from the \naverage of the three individual ice core records normalised over the common 1900-1990 period.  \nThe stacked record is shown with a 3-year smooth, and error bars show the standard error for each \nyearly value.  (b) The South Orkney SID record has been normalised over the 1903-1990 period, \nand smoothed with a 3-year running mean.  Higher normalised values represent (a) higher MSA \nconcentrations and (b) longer winter sea ice duration.  Over the 20th century the unsmoothed \nWeddell-region stacked MSA record has a negative correlation with SID at the South Orkney \nIslands (r = -0.34 [-0.50,-0.18]; [Mudelsee, 2003]).  (c)  21-year moving correlation coefficients \n(black circles) of the South Orkney SID with the Weddell-region stacked MSA record show that \nthis negative relationship was strongest during the first half of the 20th century.  Dashed lines show \nthe 95% confidence interval, computed using bootstrap methods (1000 sample Monte Carlo; \ncomputed at http:\/\/climexp.knmi.nl\/). \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n \nFigure 5.  Spectral analysis of the Weddell Sea region MSA and sea ice records.  (a) The Lomb-\nScargle spectra are shown for the 20th century records of South Orkney SID (dark grey shading) and \nthe Weddell-region stacked MSA record (black curve).  Spectra were calculated using 3 \noverlapping (50%) segments, linear detrending, and a Welch I data taper. The spectra have been \nscaled relative to the upper 90% chi-squared AR(1) red-noise bound [Schulz and Mudelsee, 2002], \nsuch that significant spectral peaks have values greater than 1 (i.e. above the cross-hatched region).  \nThis scaling method allows for a clearer comparison of the different spectra and their significant \npeaks, however it results in the loss of the typical red-noise shape of the spectra where lower \nfrequencies have higher power.  Significant peaks occur at 19 and 7-year periods in the South \nOrkney SID record, and at a 4.4-year period in the Weddell-region stacked MSA record.   Wavelet \npower spectra [Torrence and Compo, 1998] show the time evolution of variance for (b) the South \nOrkney SID record and (c) the Weddell-region stacked MSA record.  The contour levels are chosen \n 27 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \nso that 75%, 50%, 25%, and 5% of the wavelet power is above each level, respectively (blue to \nred).  Black contour is the 90% confidence level, using a red-noise AR(1) background spectrum. \nThe cross-hatched region is the cone of influence, where zero padding at the ends of the datasets has \nreduced the variance.  There are clear similarities between the wavelet spectra of the SID and \nstacked MSA records, and each shows times of significant variance at ~4 year, ~7 year and ~20 \nyear periods.   \n \nFigure 6.   Gaussian filters of variance in the Weddell-region MSA and sea ice records.  The South \nOrkney SID (shaded grey curve) and Weddell-region stacked MSA (black curve) records were \nfiltered to examine the characteristics of their variance at periods of, (a)  3.8 \u2013 5.3 years (frequency, \nf = 0.225 \u00b1 0.035 years-1), (b)  5.9 \u2013 8.3 years (f = 0.145 \u00b1  0.025 years-1) and, (c)  14.3 \u2013 25 years (f \n= 0.055 \u00b1 0.015 years-1).  Frequency bands for filtering were selected using the spectral analysis \nresults in Fig. 5, and filtering was carried out using Analyseries software [Paillard et al., 1996].  \nNote that the filtered records of Weddell-region stacked MSA in panels (b) and (c) are shown on an \ninverted scale due to their strong negative correlation with SID (Table 3).   \n \nFigure 7.  Climate anomaly maps for extreme years in the ~7 year variability band. Composite \nanomaly maps of mean sea level pressure (MSLP), 850mb zonal wind, 850mb meridional wind, and \nsurface air temperature (SAT) were constructed for years of high SID \/ low MSA (left side column; \nyears ending 1974, 1981 and 1988), years of low SID \/ high MSA (central column; years ending \n1971, 1978 and 1985), and for the difference between these extreme years (high SID minus low SID \nyears; right side column).  Anomalies represent averages running from July to June, so as to \nincorporate the austral winter SID anomaly and the following summer MSA anomaly.

Error bars show the standard error for each annual value of the stacked MSA record.  \n Longitude \nC\nor\nre\nla\ntio\nn \nco\nef\nfic\nie\nnt\n (r\n) \n90oW \n180o \n0o \n-0.8 \n-0.6 \n-0.4 \n-0.2 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n0.6 \n0.8 \nb a \nRoss \nSea\nAmundsen \nSea \nBellings- \nhausen \nSea \nWeddell \nSea \nC\nor\nre\nla\ntio\nn \nco\nef\nfic\nie\nnt\n (r\n) \n90oW \n180o \n0o \n-0.8 \n-0.6 \n-0.4 \n-0.2 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n0.6 \n0.8 \nd \nC\nor\nre\nla\ntio\nn \nco\nef\nfic\nie\nnt\n (r\n) \n90oW \n180o \n0o \n-0.8 \n-0.6 \n-0.4 \n-0.2 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n0.6 \n0.8 \nc \n0\u00ba \n-0.6 \n-0.4 \n-0.2 \n0.2 \n0.4 \n0.6 \n0.8 \n0.0 \n180\u00ba 150\u00baW 120\u00baW 90\u00baW 60\u00baW 30\u00baW \n**\n* * *\n**\n** **\n*\n*\n*\n**\n**\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3.  Correlation of ice core MSA records from the Weddell Sea region with 10\u00ba sectors of SIE \nsince 1973.  (a)  The Weddell-region stacked MSA record shows a broad region of negative \ncorrelations with SIEmax in the Weddell Sea and a positive correlation with SIEmax in the \nAmundsen\/Bellingshausen Seas.  Correlations are based on unsmoothed, annual resolution data, and \nsignificance estimations (2-tailed t-test) include corrections for serial correlation within the datasets.  \nValues marked with * and ** represent correlations that are significant at 90% and 95% levels, \nrespectively. Red circles show the locations of the three ice cores used to create the stacked MSA \nrecord.  (b)  The three individual MSA records (Dolleman Island = dashed curve; Berkner Island = \nblack solid curve; DML = grey curve) all display similar correlation patterns with SIEmax.  \nCorrelations of the Weddell-region stacked MSA record with (c) SIEmin, and (d) SIEdecay are also \nshown.

Comparison of ice core MSA records from the Weddell Sea region with sea ice duration \nat the South Orkney Islands.  (a) A stacked Weddell-region MSA record was produced from the \naverage of the three individual ice core records normalised over the common 1900-1990 period.  \nThe stacked record is shown with a 3-year smooth, and error bars show the standard error for each \nyearly value.  (b) The South Orkney SID record has been normalised over the 1903-1990 period, \nand smoothed with a 3-year running mean.  Higher normalised values represent (a) higher MSA \nconcentrations and (b) longer winter sea ice duration.  Over the 20th century the unsmoothed \nWeddell-region stacked MSA record has a negative correlation with SID at the South Orkney \nIslands (r = -0.34 [-0.50,-0.18]; [Mudelsee, 2003]).  (c)  21-year moving correlation coefficients \n(black circles) of the South Orkney SID with the Weddell-region stacked MSA record show that \nthis negative relationship was strongest during the first half of the 20th century.

Spectral analysis of the Weddell Sea region MSA and sea ice records.  (a) The \nLomb-Scargle spectra are shown for the 20th century records of South Orkney SID (dark grey \nshading) and the Weddell-region stacked MSA record (black curve).  Spectra were calculated \nusing 3 overlapping (50%) segments, linear detrending, and a Welch I data taper. The spectra \nhave been scaled relative to the upper 90% chi-squared AR(1) red-noise bound [Schulz and \nMudelsee, 2002], such that significant spectral peaks have values greater than 1 (i.e. above the \ncross-hatched region).  This scaling method allows for a clearer comparison of the different \nspectra and their significant peaks, however it results in the loss of the typical red-noise shape \nof the spectra where lower frequencies have higher power.  Significant peaks occur at 19 and \n7-year periods in the South Orkney SID record, and at a 4.4-year period in the Weddell-region \nstacked MSA record.  Wavelet power spectra [Torrence and Compo, 1998] show the time \nevolution of variance for (b) the South Orkney SID record and (c) the Weddell-region stacked \nMSA record.  The contour levels are chosen so that 75%, 50%, 25%, and 5% of the wavelet \npower is above each level, respectively (blue to red).  Black contour is the 90% confidence \nlevel, using a red-noise AR(1) background spectrum. The cross-hatched region is the cone of \ninfluence, where zero padding at the ends of the datasets has reduced the variance.  There are \nclear similarities between the wavelet spectra of the SID and stacked MSA records, and each \nshows times of significant variance at ~4 year, ~7 year and ~20 year periods.\n  \n \n \nYear \nS\nta\nnd\nar\nd \nde\nvi\nat\nio\nn \nun\nits\n \n0.0 \nc \nb \na \n1900 2000 1920 1940 1960 1980 \n0.5 \n-0.5 \n0.0 \n0.5 \n-0.5 \n0.0 \n0.5 \n-0.5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 6.   Gaussian filters of variance in the Weddell-region MSA and sea ice records.  The South \nOrkney SID (shaded grey curve) and Weddell-region stacked MSA (black curve) records were \nfiltered to examine the characteristics of their variance at periods of, (a)  3.8 \u2013 5.3 years (frequency, \nf = 0.225 \u00b1 0.035 years-1), (b)  5.9 \u2013 8.3 years (f = 0.145 \u00b1  0.025 years-1) and, (c)  14.3 \u2013 25 years (f \n= 0.055 \u00b1 0.015 years-1).  Frequency bands for filtering were selected using the spectral analysis \nresults in Fig. 5, and filtering was carried out using Analyseries software [Paillard et al., 1996].  \nNote that the filtered records of Weddell-region stacked MSA in panels (b) and (c) are shown on an \ninverted scale due to their strong negative correlation with SID (Table 3).   \n \n \n High SID \/ Low MSA Low SID \/ High MSA Difference \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7.
