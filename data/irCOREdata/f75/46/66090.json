Very rarely, there is a windfall profit and the court may have the relatively pleasant \ntask of choosing who has the better claim to it;1 however, usually the rogue is insolvent and one \nparty may suffer as a result.2  \n \nIn an insolvency, the first hurdle for a claimant will be to establish proprietary rights in relation \nto identifiable property in order to elevate himself above the position of an unsecured creditor. \nYet there is always a danger that a claimant can be divested of these proprietary rights if another \nparty can also establish proprietary rights over the same property and can successfully rely upon \none of the exceptions to the nemo dat principle, that no-one can transfer a better title than they \nhave themselves. The recent Court of Appeal decision in Michael Gerson (Leasing) Ltd. v \nWilkinson and State Securities Ltd. 3 is a significant case, which extends the protection offered \nto a second purchaser by the \u2018seller in possession\u2019 exception and exposes finance companies to \nunanticipated risks in relation to goods which they own but which are currently subject to sale \nand leaseback agreements. \n \nBackground \n \nThe essential facts were that the seller, Emshelf IX Ltd. (\u2018Emshelf\u2019), sold certain plant and \nmachinery to Michael Gerson (Leasing) Ltd. (\u2018Gerson\u2019), a finance company, under a sale and \nleaseback agreement under which Emshelf remained in physical possession of this equipment. A \nyear later, Emshelf sold the very same equipment to State Securities Ltd. (\u2018State\u2019), which was \nanother finance company, under a second sale and leaseback agreement. When Emshelf became \ninsolvent, Gerson sued State in conversion and State successfully pleaded in defence that the \n\u2018seller in possession\u2019 exception, contained in section 8 of the Factors Act 1889 and section 24 of \nthe Sale of Goods Act 1979, applied. \n \nSection 24 of the Sale of Goods Act provides: \nWhere a person having sold goods continues or is in possession of the goods, or of the \ndocuments of title to the goods, the delivery or transfer by that person ... of the goods or \ndocuments under any sale, pledge, or other disposition thereof, to any person receiving the \nsame in good faith and without notice of the previous sale, has the same effect as if the \nperson making the delivery or transfer were expressly authorised by the owner of the goods \nto make the same.  \n \n1   Foskett v McKeown [2000] 3 All ER 97, 99 per Lord Browne-Wilkinson.  \n2   Central Newbury Car Auctions Ltd. v Unity Finance Ltd. [1957] 1 QB 371, 379 per Denning L.J.  \n3   [2000] 3 WLR 1645. \n \n 2\nsis. \n                                                \n \nThus the seller in possession exception may be called into play wherever goods have been \npurchased but the seller remains in possession of them and subsequently delivers them to a \nsecond purchaser or pledgee who can show that the goods were received  in good faith. On the \nfacts, the seller, Emshelf had remained in continuing physical possession of the goods. The \ndifficult issue was whether the second purchaser, State, could be said to have received them. \nState never physically received the goods and it therefore had to argue that, according to the \nprovisions of the sale and leaseback agreement, there had been a notional \u2018constructive\u2019 delivery \nof the goods by Emshelf before the goods were leased back. \n \nThe debate regarding constructive delivery  \n \nThe question of whether physical delivery of the goods into the hands of a second purchaser is \nnecessary in order to satisfy the statutory provision, or whether proof of constructive delivery is \nenough, has been a controversial one.  Interestingly, in Michael Gerson, there was no battle over \nthis matter in the Court of Appeal: counsel for the claimant conceded that, for the purposes of \nthe appeal, constructive delivery sufficed.4  However, as the concession was so carefully \nlimited, the question could be raised afresh in the future. The matter therefore deserves analy\n \nThe authorities on this issue have been in disarray for some time. The main difficulty lay with \nthe first instance decision of Nicholson v Harper,5 in which North J. stated that there must be \nactual physical delivery of the goods after the second sale or pledge in order to satisfy the \nstatutory wording of the seller in possession exception. However, there was also the case of NZ \nSecurities & Finance Ltd. v Wrightcars Ltd.,6 in which an argument that constructive delivery of \ngoods  had been made under a sale and leaseback agreement was rejected and it was held that \nthere must be a physical delivery of the goods to the purchaser. In coming to that decision, the \nNew Zealand court relied upon Nicholson v Harper and the Australian case of Bank of New \nSouth Wales v Palmer.7 In the latter case, Helsham J. suggested that the view which he had \nformed that the seller in possession exception required physical delivery was supported by the \nstatutory word \u2018receiving.\u2019 \n \nYet the decision in Nicholson v Harper could be described as deeply flawed. There was no \npossibility on the facts of the case of actual physical delivery because the second pledgee was \nalready in possession of the goods before the pledge in his capacity as warehouseman. This fact \nwas brought to North J.\u2019s attention but the argument that there had been a constructive delivery \nto the pledgee was rejected without discussion and without any reference to past case law. There \nwere a number of cases decided before Nicholson v Harper which North J. should have  \nconsidered. In Elmore v Stone,8 for example, the claimant had sold two horses to the defendant \nbut had not been paid. Although there was no written memorandum of the sale as required by \n \n4   [2000] 3 WLR 1645, 1649 E - H, per Clarke L.J. At first instance, Michael Kershaw Q.C., sitting as a judge \nof the High Court, had held that delivery can be constructive for the purposes of the Sale of Goods Act  1979, s. \n24: Michael Gerson (Leasing) Ltd. v. Michael Wilkinson and State Securities Ltd.(1998) Unrep. 6 October, \nQBD (Liverpool). \n5    [1895] 2 Ch. 415. \n6   [1976] 1 NZLR 77 (Supreme Court in Wellington). \n7   [1970] 2 NSWLR 532 (Supreme Court of New South Wales); overruled by Gamer\u2019s Motor Centre \n(Newcastle) Proprietary Ltd. v Natwest Wholesale Australia Proprietary Ltd. (1987) 163 CLR 236. \n8  (1809) 1 Taunt 458. \n \n 3\n                                                \nthe Statute of Frauds, the agreement would still be enforceable by the claimant if delivery to the \nbuyer could be established. Mansfield C.J. held that, where the seller had agreed to look after \nthe horses for the benefit of the buyer by keeping them at livery after the sale, there had been a \nconstructive delivery of the horses to the buyer. He recognised that constructive delivery can \ntake various forms and gave the example of where the key of a warehouse in which the goods \nare stored is delivered to the buyer.9 One might add, as another example, that a bill of lading is \nthe symbol of property in goods and its delivery is treated as delivery of the goods themselves.10 \nThere are other cases in which physical delivery has not been insisted upon.11  However, in \nparticular, there have been two persuasive modern authorities concerning another exception to \nthe nemo dat rule: in both the first instance English decision of Forsythe International (UK) Ltd. \nv Silver Shipping Co Ltd. and Petroglobe International Ltd. (The Saetta)12 and the decision of \nthe High Court of Australia in Gamer\u2019s Motor Centre (Newcastle) Proprietary Ltd. v Natwest \nWholesale Australia Proprietary Ltd.,13 it was accepted that proof of constructive delivery \nwould be enough to satisfy the buyer in possession exception.  \nThe concession made in Michael Gerson that constructive delivery sufficed, which was \nwelcomed by Clarke L.J,14  was surely correct in principle: arguably Nicholson v Harper and \nsubsequent authorities15 would not have stood up to extensive scrutiny because the courts in \nthose cases had not engaged in a detailed review of past case law. Furthermore, the emphasis \nplaced upon the word \u2018receiving\u2019 by Helsham J. in Bank of New South Wales v Palmer16 could \nbe seen as self serving. For example, the word \u2018taking\u2019 can be found in the mercantile agency \nexception and no significance is attached to it.  It is submitted that, if the defendant can prove \nconstructive delivery, then he can properly be described as having received the goods. \n \nDefining constructive delivery: transfer of control  \n \nIt is delivery to the second purchaser or pledgee, rather than the antecedent contract, which has \nthe effect of divesting the first purchaser of his proprietary rights under the seller in possession \nexception. But what exactly is needed for constructive delivery?  There is statutory guidance in \nrelation to the notion of delivery itself: according to section 61 (1) of the Sale of Goods Act \n1979, unless the context suggests otherwise, \u2018delivery\u2019 is the \u2018voluntary transfer of possession \nfrom one person to another.\u2019 The transfer must be voluntary in the sense that a deliberate step \n \n9   Ibid, 460.

(1987) 163 CLR 236. \n \n 4\n                                                \nmust be taken.17 When one then turns to consider possession, statutory guidance on constructive \npossession is provided by section 1(2) of the Factors Act which states that, \u2018A person shall be \ndeemed to be in possession of goods or of the documents of title to goods, where the goods or \ndocuments of title are in his actual custody or are held by any other person subject to his control \nor for him on his behalf.\u2019 It is clear from this section that it is wrong to focus solely upon \ntransfer of physical possession; the key is the transfer of control. \n \nYet commercial arrangements can be complex and gauging the nature and extent of control \nexercised by one party may not be straightforward. One of the difficulties facing the Court of \nAppeal in determining if and when control could be said to have been transferred under a sale \nand leaseback arrangement, was that for many years the question has been obscured by the \nshadow cast by Nicholson v Harper. However, the court confirmed that there may be \nconstructive delivery where there is evidence of a change in the character of possession.18 This \nwould occur where there has been an attornment: for example, where the seller, although \nremaining in possession, acknowledges that he holds the goods on account of the buyer;19 or \nwhere a warehouseman does so,20 or indeed where the buyer already had possession but now \nacknowledges that he holds them for his own benefit.21 \n \nIn coming to its decision, the Court of Appeal considered Gamer\u2019s Motor Centre (Newcastle) \nProprietary Ltd. v Natwest Wholesale Australia Proprietary Ltd..22 The erudite leading \njudgment given by Mason C.J. in Gamer was largely taken up with justifying the principle that \nconstructive delivery was sufficient. If not for the irritant of Nicholson v Harper, the High Court \nof Australia in Gamer could have simply concentrated on the crucial question of whether \nconstructive delivery could be found to have taken place on the facts. An agreement had been \nmade by Gamer to sell cars to a dealer subject to a reservation of title clause. The dealer took \npossession of the cars and resold them to a finance company, Natwest.  Natwest never took \nactual physical possession of the cars; instead, the dealer retained them. Nevertheless, Natwest \nwas able to rely upon the buyer in possession exception. The High Court of Australia held that \nthere had been constructive delivery when the dealer sent a delivery receipt to Natwest giving \nparticulars of the transaction and confirming in effect that Natwest was the owner.23 A criticism \nwhich had been made of the decision in Gamer was that a simple delivery note would not \nordinarily amount to acknowledgment of change of control.24 Clarke L.J. expressly dealt with \n \n17  Forsythe International (UK) Ltd. v Silver Shipping Co Ltd. and Petroglobe International Ltd.

He drew upon the report of the facts of Gamer at a lower appellate \nlevel25 and concluded that the delivery order in Gamer had in fact been more than a simple \nreceipt. The delivery order expressly provided that Natwest could recover the goods without \nnotice and this statement evidenced the transfer of control to Natwest. \n \nThe Court of Appeal in Michael Gerson then had to consider the particular obligations imposed \nby a sale and leaseback agreement. There would have had less difficulty if the facts had been \notherwise and there had been an ordinary sale followed by a later request from the seller to \nborrow the goods for a specified period of time. These were the facts in Marvin v Wallis,26 and \nit was held that, as the seller had acknowledged the buyer\u2019s title and merely held the goods as a \nbailee, there had been constructive delivery of the goods to the buyer sufficient to satisfy the \nStatute of Frauds.  Michael Gerson was different: there was one entire transaction. It was argued \non behalf of the claimant that Emshelf never lost control of the goods under such an agreement: \nthere was not a moment in time when State could truly be said to be the owner with a right to \ninsist on actual physical delivery of the goods and with the ability to choose whether to lease the \ngoods to Emshelf or not.27 This argument had considerable force because of the fact that, once \nthe lease took effect, it would be Emshelf who would be treated in law as having possession of \nthe goods.28 However, the court rejected the argument. In effect, the sale and leaseback \nagreement was taken as a genuine description of what the parties intended. The court considered \nthe terms of the lease and reasoned that State would not have been entitled to declare that it was \nthe owner of the goods or to fulfil its obligations under the lease (such as delivery to Emshelf) if \nit did not have constructive possession of the goods in law at some point. It was concluded that \nthere had been a constructive delivery to State followed by a redelivery to Emshelf. Clarke L.J. \nadmitted that he was influenced by commercial considerations in coming to his decision: he \nthought that sale and leaseback agreements should be brought within the scope of the seller in \npossession exception.29 \n \nImplications and critique of the decision \n \nJudged purely from a sale of goods perspective, the decision in Michael Gerson can be \nwelcomed.  It provides useful guidance on what amounts to constructive delivery by focussing \nupon control: sale and leaseback agreements were analysed as involving a transfer of control \nover the goods to the purchaser followed by a retransfer of control to the lessee. Pill L.J. \nsuggested that there was a danger of creating fine distinctions between sale and leaseback \nagreements and other transactions otherwise.30 If one accepts that sale and leaseback agreements \nare more than artificial credit arrangements and genuinely do involve a sale of goods followed \nby a lease, then they are difficult to distinguish from situations where the seller, a moment after \nthe sale, asks to borrow the goods. Indeed, in Marvin v Wallis itself, the request by the seller to \nborrow the horse followed within seconds of completion of the sale. \n \n25   [1985] 3 NSWLR 475 (Court of Appeal of New South Wales); see [2000] 3 WLR 1645, 1650 G-H per \nClarke L.J.  \n26   (1856) 6 El. & Bl. 726, 25 LJQB 369 (cited in the Court of Appeal as Marvin v. Wallace). \n27  [2000] 3 WLR 1645, 1655 F-G, 1669 B-C. \n28   See Anglo-Irish Asset Finance v D.S.G. Financial Services [1995] CLY 4491, where it was held that, in the \ncontext of the seller in possession exception, it was the hirers, rather than the owner, who had constructive \npossession of cars let on hire-purchase. \n29   [2000] 3 WLR 1645, 1657 A-B. Pill L.J. preferred to express no view on this point: ibid 1669 D. \n30   [2000] 3 WLR 1645, 1669D. \n \n 6\n                                                \n \nAlthough it was conceded that constructive delivery was sufficient for the \u2018seller in possession\u2019 \nexception, the decision in Michael Gerson can be used to add further weight to the argument \nthat, in principle, constructive delivery should suffice for both the \u2018seller in possession\u2019 and \n\u2018buyer in possession\u2019 exceptions. Actual physical delivery has never been required for any of the \nother exceptions to the nemo dat rule and, although each exception has its own particular \nconditions which have to be met, harmony on basic principles is desirable. Moreover, the Court \nof Appeal\u2019s decision in Michael Gerson can be seen as in tune with the historical development \nof the seller in possession exception: Parliament was concerned to protect purchasers where, to \nall outward appearances, the seller continued to appear as owner of the goods because he still \nremained in possession of them.31 \n \nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s analysis of the law creates greater harmony within the Sale of Goods Act \n1979 itself. The concept of constructive delivery and the question of relinquishing control is \nhighly significant in relation to transfer of property. For example, evidence that the seller \nintended to retain control over the goods after the contract is made will suggest that property in \nspecific goods was not intended to pass at the time of the contract.32 There is also a linked \nrelationship between control and delivery on the one hand and the transfer of property in the \ngoods by appropriation with the other party\u2019s assent on the other: this is true not only in relation \nto the purchase of a specific quantity of goods from a larger bulk33 but also in relation to the \npurchase of generic goods which have been ascertained.34 As Re Stapylton Fletcher Ltd. 35 \nillustrates, there may be a constructive delivery and the property in goods may be transferred to \na buyer even where, because the contract is one of sale and storage, the goods are never \nphysically handed over and returned but simply moved to another warehouse to be stored until \nrequired. \n \nYet some difficulties remain. One argument made on behalf of the claimant was that the \ndefendant did not have possession within the meaning of section 1 (2) of the Factors Act 1889. \nThis was rejected on the basis that constructive possession would suffice.36 It is submitted that \nthis aspect of the decision is uncontroversial.37 However, somewhat surprisingly, Clarke L.J. \n \n31   Pacific Motor Auctions Pty Ltd. v Motor Credits (Hire Finance) Ltd.

This raises uncertainty where none existed before. A good faith \npurchaser can rely on either set of provisions which, apart from one minor detail, are the same.38 \nThe two statutes are frequently read together:39 in particular, even where the Sale of Goods Act \nis pleaded, a courts must use the same generous definition of a document of title which is to be \nfound in the Factors Act.40 A lack of consistency between the two statutes would be completely \nundesirable in an area of law which is already highly technical. \n \nThere is one outstanding issue concerning the seller in possession exception. It was established \nby the Privy Council in Pacific Motor Auctions Pty. Ltd. v Motor Credits (Hire Finance) Ltd.41 \nthat a seller has the power to pass a good title to the second buyer provided he remains in \ncontinuous physical possession of the goods regardless of the character of the possession. Will \nconstructive possession by the seller suffice in these circumstances?42 It is submitted that it \nshould where, for example, the seller does not have actual physical possession of the goods \nbecause they are stored in a warehouse.43  \n \nYet it has to be said that the decision in Michael Gerson may not receive a warm welcome from \ninsolvency practitioners. One weakness was that, as there was one transaction, it was difficult to \npinpoint exactly when the goods were delivered to State. The court acknowledged the problem \nbut Clarke L.J. sidelined this difficulty by suggesting that it was unnecessary to identify a \nmoment at which the goods were delivered.44 This is unsatisfactory. If a decision in relation to \nproprietary rights hangs upon whether constructive delivery has taken place or not, then the \ncourt should determine the exact time when such delivery occurred. Traders need to know when \nproprietary rights have been vested or divested. Timing is everything where there is an \ninsolvency.45 Arguably the Court of Appeal in Michael Gerson should have gone further and \nexpressly stated that constructive delivery of the goods to State took place when the agreement \nwas made: for a moment in time, State could be described as the owner before the lease took \neffect and redelivery of the goods occurred. \n \nAn interesting aspect of the decision relates to the use of sale and leaseback arrangements as a \nform of secured lending. These agreements have always been vulnerable to attack by creditors in \na company\u2019s insolvency: if it can be shown that an agreement is in substance a disguised \n \n38   Sale of Goods Act 1979, s. 21(2) provides that the provisions of the Factors Act are not excluded. \n39   Cahn and Mayer v Pockett's Bristol Channel Steam Packet Co.

(1987) 163 CLR 236; the judges in the majority were content to give \u2018delivery\u2019 a \ndifferent meaning from possession if this was necessary: ibid Mason C.J. at 248 - 249; 254 per Brennan J., 260 \nper Dawson J.  \n44   [2000] 3 WLR 1645, 1655 H. \n45   See, for example, Neste Oy v Lloyd\u2019s Bank plc [1983] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 658. \n \n 8\n                                                \nmortgage to secure a loan then it is unenforceable unless it has been registered.46 It is a question \nof looking at the parties\u2019 intentions and the contractual terms to decide whether the sale was \ngenuine or not.47 This line of attack would have been unattractive to the claimant given that its \nown right to possession rested on the validity of its sale and leaseback agreement. In any event, \nthe courts have tended to take a generous approach in upholding these agreements. However, the \ndecision in Michael Gerson provides a cautionary reminder to finance companies that the \nflexibility which makes these agreements so appealing may be bought at the expense of safety \nregarding their security. The defendant succeeded in divesting the claimant of its proprietary \nrights by using an exception to the nemo dat rule. Yet the effect of the decision is that the \ndefendant\u2019s proprietary rights could just as easily have been divested in turn if a third sale and \nleaseback agreement had been made. Owners operate in a world of title relativity:48 there is \nalways a risk that another person may come forward with a better right to possession.  \n \nA sale and leaseback agreement is a useful method by which an ailing trader can obtain a quick \ninjection of capital to keep a business going. Will the decision in Michael Gerson affect its \npopularity? Ordinarily, it would not be feasible for finance companies to take physical \npossession of goods before leasing them back in order to avoid the situation where the lessee \nremains as a \u2018seller in possession.\u2019 It is more likely that finance companies will continue to \nmake use of sale and leaseback agreements but will factor in this additional risk by offering to \npurchase at a lower valuation. Ironically, therefore, the court\u2019s decision to take a generous and \npragmatic attitude to sale and leaseback arrangements, enabling innocent finance companies to \ntake advantage of the \u2018seller in possession\u2019 exception, may tend to discourage their use. Yet the \nreal problem lies in a more general malaise in the law of credit and security: years ago, in \nMoorgate Mercantile Co. Ltd v. Twitchings,49 Lord Wilberforce bewailed the lack of a proper \nregistration system of movables 50 to protect innocent purchasers and pointed out that the \nabsence of such a system provided a fertile ground for fraud. Law reform in this area is now \noverdue. \n \n46   Companies Act 1985, s. 395.
