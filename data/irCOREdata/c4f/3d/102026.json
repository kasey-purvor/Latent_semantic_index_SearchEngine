Introduction. Spiral waves arise in many biological, chemical, and physical systems.\nThey rotate rigidly as functions of time, and a typical spatial pro\ufb01le of a planar spiral wave\nis shown in Figure 1(i). The importance of spiral waves is partly due to the fact that exper-\nimentally observed patterns are often organized by interacting spirals. Upon varying system\nparameters, spiral waves may destabilize, and the resulting instabilities lead often to more\ncomplex coherent patterns or to spatio-temporally disorganized dynamics. Examples of ex-\nperimentally observed instabilities are meander instabilities [17, 20, 24], core [49] and far-\ufb01eld\nbreakup [26], and period-doubling instabilities [27, 28, 47].\nFrom a classical dynamical-systems viewpoint, we expect that the transition to compli-\ncated dynamics is initiated by a sequence of generic local or global bifurcations\u2014saddle-node\nand Hopf bifurcations in the case of equilibria, and saddle-node, Hopf, and period-doubling\nbifurcations in the case of periodic orbits. Indeed, chemical reactions can be modeled by\nreaction-di\ufb00usion systems in bounded domains for which bifurcations can be reduced to\n\ufb01nite-dimensional center manifolds, and where instabilities are therefore expected to be of\nthe aforementioned type.\nIn a \ufb01rst attempt to understand spiral-wave instabilities, we can view spirals as time-\nperiodic solutions while disregarding their spatial structure: note that spirals rotate rigidly\nas functions of time and that their wave pattern repeats itself after one period of rotation;\nsee Figure 1(i). Thus, from this viewpoint, we expect to see Hopf and period-doubling bi-\nfurcations as typical precursors on the route to complicated spatio-temporal dynamics.

Snapshots of the w-component of two-dimensional ( 2D) spiral waves in the Ro\u00a8ssler equation\n(1.3) are shown for two di\ufb00erent parameter values: (i) shows a rigidly-rotating spiral wave for C = 2.95 in\nthe accompanying animation (66815 01.mpg [542KB]), while (ii) shows the spiral wave for C = 3.4 after a\nperiod-doubling bifurcation in the accompanying animation (66815 02.mpg [653KB]). The period-doubled spiral\nexhibits a line defect, which emanates from the core and ends at the bottom of the boundary, in order to\naccommodate the phase-shifted wave trains to either side.\nbifurcations have indeed been observed and give rise to meander instabilities [2]. What ap-\npears to be chaotic hypermeander of spiral tips has also been observed for parameter values\nfar beyond the meandering transition, but, to our knowledge, the question of whether com-\nplicated hypermeander is actually caused by subsequent secondary bifurcations has not yet\nbeen settled.\nMore recently, a di\ufb00erent type of instability has been observed both in experiments [27,\n28, 47] and in numerical simulations [14]. The primary spiral destabilizes as illustrated in\nFigure 1(ii) and gives rise to a new spiral wave that emits wave trains with doubled wavelength\nand temporal period. An additional feature of this transition is the occurrence of a line defect\nthat emerges from the spiral core and which accommodates the necessary mismatch of the\nphases of the oscillations that are emitted by the spiral core. The pattern still repeats itself\nbut only after two rotations of the spiral core. Thus, the spiral wave, regarded as a time-\nperiodic solution, has undergone a period-doubling bifurcation, and, in accordance with the\nliterature, we will refer to this instability as period-doubling of spiral waves.\nThis apparently straightforward explanation is, however, too simple. Consider, for ex-\nample, the spiral wave as a solution in a circular domain. We may then pass to a rigidly\ncorotating coordinate frame in which the spiral wave becomes an equilibrium. In particular,\nwe can obtain the Floquet multipliers of the spiral wave in the original laboratory frame sim-\nply by exponentiating the eigenvalues of the spiral wave in the corotating frame where the\nspiral is an equilibrium. An application of the spectral mapping theorem then shows that a\nsimple eigenvalue \u03c1 = \u22121 cannot occur for the exponential of the real linearization in the coro-\ntating frame. In other words, in rotationally symmetric domains, spiral waves are equilibria\nwhen considered in a corotating frame, which generically undergo only saddle-node or Hopf\nbifurcations. From this perspective, period-doubling ceases to be meaningful as an instability\nmechanism.\nThus, the only conceivable explanation left is that the instability is a Hopf bifurcation.\nSince the temporal period of the bifurcating patterns observed in experiments and numerical\n496 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nsimulations is approximately twice the period of the primary spiral, the Hopf frequency \u03c9H\nneeds to be in a 2:1 resonance with the rotation frequency \u03c9\u2217 of the spiral wave so that\n\u03c9H =\n\u03c9\u2217\n2\n.\nFrom a genericity viewpoint, it is therefore important to understand which mechanism enforces\nthis 2:1 resonance of the Hopf frequency of eigenvalues and the rotation frequency of the spiral\nwave. This natural question is indeed the central point of this paper.\nThe seemingly arti\ufb01cial choice of the corotating frame can be put in a slightly more\nsystematic context once the symmetries of the problem are taken into account. Posing the\nunderlying reaction-di\ufb00usion system on a circular domain, rotations in SO(2) of the domain\nact on patterns and map solutions of the system to solutions. Spiral waves are relative\nequilibria with respect to this group action; that is, their time evolution is equivalent to the\naction of the group: spirals are rigidly rotating. The isotropy of the spiral waves that we\nconsider is trivial: only a full rotation by 2\u03c0 maps the spiral pro\ufb01le onto itself. Consequently,\ncenter manifolds near spiral waves are principal \ufb01ber bundles, given as a direct product of the\nunderlying symmetry group SO(2) and a complement of the tangent space of the group orbit\nin the center eigenspace [43]. In particular, the center manifold is a globally trivial bundle,\nwhich provides yet another reason for why the case of a simple negative Floquet multiplier \u22121\nis precluded for period-doubling bifurcations of spiral waves as this scenario requires the center\nmanifold to be nonorientable. The structure of the principal \ufb01ber bundle can be understood\nby \ufb01rst constructing a center manifold in a Poincare\u00b4 section, which is also a section to the\ngroup orbit, and then transporting the center manifold along the periodic orbit using the\ngroup action.\nSymmetry is also the key to understanding the meandering patterns that arise at Hopf\nbifurcations. As \ufb01rst pointed out by Barkley [2], the meandering motion of spiral waves\ncan be understood if we consider the spiral wave on the entire plane where, in addition to\nrotations, spatial translation of patterns maps solutions to solutions. The full symmetry\ngroup is therefore the special Euclidean group SE(2) of translations and rotations in the\nplane. Center manifolds near relative equilibria can still be described as principal \ufb01ber bundles\nSE(2)\u00d7V , where V corresponds to the Hopf eigenmodes. The dynamics on the center manifold\nis of skew-product form: After an appropriate reparametrization of time, the dynamics near\nonset is governed [7, 12, 43] by the ordinary di\ufb00erential equations (ODEs)\na\u02d9 = ei\u03d5[v +O(|v|2)],\n\u03d5\u02d9 = \u03c9\u2217,\nv\u02d9 = [\u03bc+ i\u03c9H]v \u2212 (1\u2212 i\u03b1)|v|2v,\nwhere \u03d5 denotes the phase of the spiral, that is, its angle of rotation relative to a \ufb01xed\nreference frame, a = x + iy is its position, and v \u2208 C parametrizes a neighborhood of the\norigin in the Hopf eigenspace. Substituting the periodic orbit v\u2217(t) with frequency \u03c9H + \u03bc\u03b1\nof the v-equation and the solution \u03d5\u2217(t) = \u03c9\u2217t of the \u03d5-equation into the equation for a, and\nexpanding the resulting equation in Fourier modes, we \ufb01nd that the solution a\u2217(t) is given by\n(1.1) a\u2217(t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\nak\nei[\u03c9\u2217\u2212k(\u03c9H+\u03bc\u03b1)]t \u2212 1\n\u03c9\u2217 \u2212 k(\u03c9H + \u03bc\u03b1)\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 497\nso that the spiral tip stays bounded unless \u03c9\u2217 and \u03c9H are resonant. When\n(1.2) \u03c9\u2217 = \u0007\u03c9H for some \u0007 \u2208 Z,\nthen the tip position a\u2217(t) = a\u0005t + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 is unbounded near \u03bc = 0, and the spiral wave drifts\nwith velocity a\u0005. The resonance \u0007 = 1 has been observed frequently in experiments [2, 46].\nReturning to the period-doubling instability of spiral waves, we have already inferred\nthat period-doubling ought to be a resonant Hopf bifurcation with \u0007 = 2 in (1.2). The drift\npredicted by (1.1) had not been observed originally in the experiments [47] or the numerical\nsimulations [14]. Based on the theoretical predictions outlined above, we observed drift in the\nRo\u00a8ssler system\nut = 0.4\u0394u\u2212 v \u2212 w,\nvt = 0.4\u0394v + u+ 0.2 v,(1.3)\nwt = 0.4\u0394w + uw \u2212 Cw + 0.2,\nupon varying C (and we report on these results in section 6 below). Independently, drift was\nalso observed in [4] for the system (1.3).\nIn summary, the supposition of an exact 2:1 resonance of the Hopf frequency of eigenvalues\nand the rotation frequency of the spiral wave leads to the prediction that period-doubled spirals\nshould drift, which was, in turn, veri\ufb01ed in numerical simulations. Thus, the remaining key\nquestion is what enforces this resonance which seems to be nongeneric and should not occur\nin one-parameter systems such as (1.3).\nAt this point, it is time to emphasize that the reduction results for planar patterns in\nthe presence of the noncompact Euclidean group hold only for localized rotating waves. For\nArchimedean spirals, the presence of essential spectrum on the imaginary axis prevents a re-\nduction to a \ufb01nite-dimensional system. While this issue may appear to be of a purely technical\nnature for meandering instabilities where theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement\nwith experimental and numerical results, the situation is di\ufb00erent for period-doubling instabil-\nities. We shall argue that period-doubling of spirals is not caused by isolated point spectrum\nbut instead by the essential spectrum of the asymptotic wave trains.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we shall show that ordinary period-doubling bifurcations of wave trains in the\ntraveling-wave equation create 2:1 resonances of the essential spectra of planar spiral waves\nthat are spatially asymptotic to these wave trains in their far \ufb01eld. More precisely, period-\ndoubling instabilities of wave trains manifest themselves for planar spiral waves in the form\nof curves of essential spectrum that cross the imaginary axis \ufb01rst at exactly \u039b = \u00b1i\u03c9\u2217\/2.\nIn particular, robust 2:1 resonances can occur in an open set of one-parameter families of\nreaction-di\ufb00usion systems. When posed on physically relevant bounded domains such as\ndisks of radius R, we had shown previously in [35, 41, 42] that spiral spectra accumulate in\nthe limit R\u2192\u221e onto the so-called absolute spectrum. We show here that absolute spectra of\nwave trains near period-doubling bifurcations are symmetric with respect to re\ufb02ections across\nIm\u039b = i\u03c9\u2217\/2: One generic possibility is therefore that the absolute spectrum lies entirely on\nthe line Im\u039b = i\u03c9\u2217\/2, leading again to a 2:1 resonance. The latter case occurs, in fact, for\nwave trains with small wave numbers near spatially homogeneous oscillations. Last, we shall\nalso investigate the nature of the line defect apparent in Figure 1(ii).\n498 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nPlan of the paper.\nSection 2: Contains the analysis of spatio-temporal period-doubling of one-dimensional (1D)\nwave trains on which the remainder of this paper relies.\nSection 3: Spatio-temporal period-doubling for 1D sources (can be skipped at \ufb01rst reading).\nSection 4: Extends the spectral results in section 2 from wave trains to planar Archimedean\nspiral waves and explains the 2:1 resonance of Hopf eigenvalues.\nSection 5: Spatial dynamics is used to analyze line defects and boundary layers in period-\ndoubling bifurcations near spatially homogeneous oscillations.\nSection 6: Applies our results to the Ro\u00a8ssler system (1.3) in which period-doubling had been\nobserved previously.\nSection 7: Discussion of results and their limitations.\n2. Spatio-temporal period-doubling of wave trains. Our interest in this section is to\nstudy period-doubling bifurcations of wave trains and how these manifest themselves on the\nspectral level in di\ufb00erent coordinate frames. The results obtained here are crucial for our\nanalysis of period-doubling of spiral waves which we will undertake in section 4.\nWe consider reaction-di\ufb00usion systems\n(2.1) ut = Duxx + f(u;\u03bc), x \u2208 R,\nfor u \u2208 Rn and \u03bc \u2208 R, where D is a positive diagonal matrix and the nonlinearity f : Rn\u00d7R \u2192\nR\nn is smooth. We assume that (2.1) with \u03bc = 0 has a wave-train solution uwt(kx \u2212 \u03c9t) for\nan appropriate wave number k and temporal frequency \u03c9, where we assume that uwt is 2\u03c0-\nperiodic in its argument so that uwt(\u03be) = uwt(\u03be + 2\u03c0) for all \u03be.\n2.1. Spatial and temporal period-doubling. If the wave number k vanishes, then u(x, t) =\nuwt(\u2212\u03c9t) is a spatially homogeneous oscillation which satis\ufb01es the ODE\n(2.2) ut = f(u;\u03bc).\nPeriod-doubling of uwt(\u2212\u03c9t) occurs when \u03c1 = \u22121 is a temporal Floquet multiplier of the\nlinearization of the period map associated with (2.2) about uwt. The multiplier \u03c1 = \u22121\nis generically simple, and the resulting purely temporal period-doubling leads to a spatially\nhomogeneous oscillation with frequency close to \u03c9\/2.\nNext, assume that k \u0005= 0. In this case, we can pass from the laboratory frame x to the\ncomoving frame \u03be = kx\u2212 \u03c9t in which (2.1) becomes\n(2.3) ut = k\n2Du\u03be\u03be + \u03c9u\u03be + f(u;\u03bc).\nNote that uwt(\u03be) is an equilibrium solution of (2.3) with spatial period 2\u03c0, and we focus here\non steady-state bifurcations of (2.3) which are captured by the traveling-wave ODE\n(2.4) k2Du\u03be\u03be + \u03c9u\u03be + f(u;\u03bc) = 0.\nSpatial period-doubling of the 2\u03c0-periodic orbit uwt(\u03be) of (2.4) occurs when\n(2.5) k2Dv\u03be\u03be + \u03c9v\u03be + fu(uwt(\u03be);\u03bc)v = 0\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 499\nhas a nonzero solution vpd(\u03be) with vpd(\u03be + 2\u03c0) = \u2212vpd(\u03be) for all \u03be, corresponding to a simple\nspatial Floquet multiplier at \u22121. This bifurcation corresponds to a generic pitchfork bifurca-\ntion of (2.3) when we pose it on the spatial interval (0, 4\u03c0) with periodic boundary conditions.\nThe Z2-symmetry that turns the steady-state bifurcation into a pitchfork is generated by the\nshift \u03be \u0006\u2192 \u03be + 2\u03c0 which also generates the isotropy group of the equilibrium uwt of spatial\nperiod 2\u03c0 when considered on the interval (0, 4\u03c0). Lyapunov\u2013Schmidt reduction for the non-\nlinear problem (2.4) on an appropriate function space of 4\u03c0-periodic function leads to a family\nof spatially period-doubled equilibria that bifurcate from uwt. Center-manifold reduction, or\nLyapunov\u2013Schmidt reduction [19], shows that the principle of exchange of stability holds for\nthe temporal dynamics of (2.3) on the space of 4\u03c0-periodic functions provided the cubic co-\ne\ufb03cient of the reduced equation is nonzero. In other words, the bifurcating pattern is stable\nas a solution to (2.3) if it exists for parameter values for which the primary pattern uwt is\nunstable. We refer the reader to [8] for a discussion of the multiplicity of period-doubling\neigenvalues using Evans functions.\nLast, we interpret these results in the laboratory frame. Assuming that k \u0005= 0 and \u03c9 \u0005= 0,\nwe consider (2.1) on the interval (0, 4\u03c0\/k) with periodic boundary conditions. Equation (2.1)\ngenerates a compact semi\ufb02ow \u03a6t on H\n2\nper(0,\n4\u03c0\nk ), and the wave train uwt corresponds to a\ntime-periodic solution with period T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9. We refer to eigenvalues \u03c1 of the linearized\nperiod map \u03a6\u2032T (uwt) as Floquet multipliers, which turn out to be conveniently related to the\nspectrum of the linearization\n(2.6) \u03bbv = Dk2v\u03be\u03be + \u03c9v\u03be + fu(uwt(\u03be); 0)v\nof (2.3) with 4\u03c0-periodic boundary conditions about the equilibrium uwt(\u03be). Indeed, any\nnontrivial solution v(\u03be) to the eigenvalue problem (2.6) gives a solution w(x, \u00b7) of the eigenvalue\nproblem for the period map of (2.1) in the laboratory frame via\nw(x, t) = e\u03bbtv(kx\u2212 \u03c9t), w(x, T ) = e\u03bbT v(kx\u2212 2\u03c0)\nand vice versa. Spatial period-doubling of (2.6) corresponds to \u03bb = 0 and v(\u03be) with v(\u03be+2\u03c0) =\n\u2212v(\u03be) for all \u03be. The resulting solution w(x, t) satis\ufb01es w(x, T ) = \u2212w(x, 0) and therefore gives\na simple Floquet multiplier \u03c1 = \u22121. We refer to the occurrence of a simple Floquet multiplier\n\u03c1 = \u22121 of \u03a6\u2032T (uwt) as spatio-temporal period-doubling.\n2.2. Essential spectra of wave trains. More generally, we can consider the linearization\non the real line x \u2208 R. First, consider the linearization\n(2.7) vt = Dk\n2v\u03be\u03be + \u03c9v\u03be + fu(uwt(\u03be); 0)v, \u03be \u2208 R,\nin the comoving frame together with the associated eigenvalue problem\n(2.8) \u03bbv = Dk2v\u03be\u03be + \u03c9v\u03be + fu(uwt(\u03be); 0)v, \u03be \u2208 R.\nWe write this equation as the \ufb01rst-order system\n(2.9) vx =\n(\n0 1\nk\u22122D\u22121[\u03bb\u2212 fu(uwt(\u03be); 0)] \u03c9k\u22122D\u22121\n)\nv\n500 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nand denote the associated 2\u03c0-period map by \u03a82\u03c0(\u03bb). Spatial Floquet exponents \u03bd\/k of (2.8)\nor (2.9) are determined as roots of the Wronskian\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) := det\n[\ne2\u03c0\u03bd\/k \u2212\u03a82\u03c0(\u03bb)\n]\n.\nThe Wronskian d(\u03bb, \u03bd) satis\ufb01es\n(2.10)\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = d(\u03bb\u00af, \u03bd\u00af) (complex conjugation),\nd(\u03bb, \u03bd) = d(\u03bb, \u03bd + ik\u0007) (arti\ufb01cial Floquet conjugation)\nfor all integers \u0007. Spatial Floquet exponents can also be found by seeking nontrivial solutions\nto (2.8) of the form\n(2.11) v(\u03be) = e\u03bd\u03be\/kv0(\u03be), v0(\u03be + 2\u03c0) = v0(\u03be) \u2200\u03be,\nwhere v0 is a 2\u03c0-periodic solution of\n(2.12) \u03bbv = D(k\u2202\u03be + \u03bd)\n2v +\n\u03c9\nk\n(k\u2202\u03be + \u03bd)v + fu(uwt(\u03be); 0)v.\nPurely imaginary spatial Floquet exponents \u03bd \u2208 iR give eigenvalues \u03bb of (2.8), and each\neigenfunction (2.11) leads to a solution\nv(\u03be, t) = e\u03bbte\u03bd\u03be\/kv0(\u03be)\nof (2.7). We record that spatial period-doubling as discussed in section 2.1 is equivalent to\nhaving a nontrivial solution v of (2.12) for \u03bb = 0 and \u03bd = ik\/2.\nIn the laboratory frame, the relevant linearization is\n(2.13) ut = Duxx + fu(uwt(kx\u2212 \u03c9t); 0)u, x \u2208 R.\nTemporal Floquet multipliers \u03c1 and the associated Floquet exponents \u039b in the laboratory\nframe are determined by bounded nontrivial solutions u(x, t) of (2.13) with\nu(x, T ) = \u03c1u(x, 0) = e\u039bTu(x, 0),\nwhere T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9. It turns out that \u039b is a temporal Floquet exponent if and only if there is a\nnontrivial solution of (2.13) of the form\nu(x, t) = e\u039bte\u03bdxu0(kx\u2212 \u03c9t)\nwith \u03bd \u2208 iR, where u0 is 2\u03c0-periodic in its argument. Solutions of this form for arbitrary\n\u03bd \u2208 C are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions (2.11) of (2.8) via\nu(x, t) = e\u03bbte\u03bd\u03be\/kv0(\u03be) = e\n[\u03bb\u2212\u03bd\u03c9\/k]te\u03bdxv0(kx\u2212 \u03c9t) = e\u039bte\u03bdxv0(kx\u2212 \u03c9t)\nwith\n(2.14) \u039b = \u03bb\u2212 \u03c9\u03bd\nk\n= \u03bb\u2212 cp\u03bd,\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 501\nwhere cp = \u03c9\/k is the phase speed of the wave train uwt. Thus, the temporal Floquet\nexponents \u039b in the laboratory frame are roots of\nD(\u039b, \u03bd) := d(\u039b + cp\u03bd, \u03bd).\nUsing (2.10), we see that D satis\ufb01es\n(2.15)\nD(\u039b, \u03bd) = D(\u039b\u00af, \u03bd\u00af) (complex conjugation),\nD(\u039b, \u03bd) = D(\u039b\u2212 i\u03c9\u0007, \u03bd + ik\u0007) (Floquet conjugation)\nfor all integers \u0007. Typically, solutions of d(\u03bb, \u03bd) = 0 come in curves \u03bb = \u03bb\u2217(\u03bd), yielding also\n\u039b = \u039b\u2217(\u03bd). For \u03bd \u2208 iR, we refer to these curves as dispersion curves in the comoving and the\nlaboratory frames, respectively. We say that a dispersion curve \u039b\u2217(\u03bd) is simple if\n\u2202\u039bD(\u039b, \u03bd) = \u2202\u03bbd(\u03bb, \u03bd) \u0005= 0\nat \u039b = \u039b\u2217(\u03bd) or \u03bb = \u03bb\u2217(\u03bd). The derivative\ncg := \u2212d Im\u039b\nd Im \u03bd\nis commonly referred to as the group velocity in the laboratory frame. The relation (2.14) can\ntherefore be viewed as transforming the group velocity from the laboratory to the comoving\nframe by subtracting the speed of the frame.\nEquation (2.14) implies that spatial period-doubling with \u03bb = 0 and \u03bd = ik\/2 in the\ncomoving frame becomes spatio-temporal period-doubling with \u039b = \u2212i\u03c9\/2 and \u03bd = ik\/2 in\nthe laboratory frame. The observation that the composition of the two symmetries in (2.15)\n\ufb01xes Im\u039b = \u2212i\u03c9\/2 leads us to the following lemma on robustness of period-doubling.\nLemma 2.1 (robustness of spatio-temporal period-doubling). Assume that there is a simple\ndispersion curve \u039b(\u03bd) with\n(2.16) Im\u039b(ik\/2) = \u2212 i\u03c9\n2\n;\nthen the dispersion curve is re\ufb02ection symmetric about the line Im\u039b = \u2212i\u03c9\/2 for \u03bd close to\nik\/2. Moreover, (2.16) is robust under su\ufb03ciently small perturbations of the parameter value\n\u03bc and the coe\ufb03cients uwt(\u03be) in (2.6).\nProof. From (2.15), we conclude that D(\u039b, \u03bd) = 0 if and only if D(\u039b\u00af \u2212 i\u03c9, \u03bd\u00af + ik) = 0.\nUpon substituting \u039b = \u2212i\u03c9\/2 + l and \u03bd = ik\/2 + i\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2208 R into these identities, we see\nthat D(\u2212i\u03c9\/2 + l, ik\/2 + i\u03b3) = 0 if and only if D(\u2212i\u03c9\/2 + l\u00af, ik\/2 \u2212 i\u03b3) = 0. Applying the\nimplicit function theorem to both equations, and using uniqueness of solutions, we conclude\nthat l(\u2212\u03b3) = l\u00af(\u03b3) for all \u03b3 close to zero, which implies the asserted symmetry of the dispersion\ncurve about the line Im\u039b = \u2212i\u03c9\/2. Robustness with respect to parameter variations is again\na consequence of the implicit function theorem.\nIn preparation for the analysis in the following two sections, we examine the linearization\nin exponentially weighted spaces\n(2.17) L2\u03b7 := {u \u2208 L2loc; |u|L2\u03b7 <\u221e}, |u|2L2\u03b7 :=\n\u222b\nR\n|u(x)|2e\u22122\u03b7x dx.\n502 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nThe spectra in L2\u03b7 can be computed in the same way as for \u03b7 = 0 by solving (2.12) with\n\u03bd \u2208 \u03b7 + iR, which yields an \u03b7-dependent family of dispersion curves \u039b(\u03bd) with Re \u03bd = \u03b7. The\nreal part of these curves depends on \u03b7 according to\ndRe\u039b\nd\u03b7\n=\ndRe\u039b\ndRe \u03bd\n=\nd Im\u039b\nd Im \u03bd\n= \u2212cg,\nwhere we used the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations for the complex analytic function \u039b(\u03bd) in the\nsecond equality. In particular, if the group velocity cg is positive, then positive weight rates\n\u03b7 > 0, which predominantly measure mass accumulating at x\u2192 \u2212\u221e, push dispersion curves\n\u039b(\u03bd) toward the stable direction since dRe\u039bd\u03b7 < 0. This can in fact be viewed as a justi\ufb01cation\nof the terminology for cg in the sense that the group velocity measures transport from negative\nto positive x.\nFrom now on, we shall always denote the temporal Floquet exponents of wave trains in\nthe comoving frame by \u03bb and in the laboratory frame by \u039b.\n2.3. Absolute spectra of wave trains. When we pass to large bounded domains with sep-\narated boundary conditions, exponential weights generate equivalent topologies for each \ufb01nite\ndomain size L. In [34], we showed that the spectrum of the linearized period map, considered\non large but \ufb01nite domains with typical separated boundary conditions, converges in the limit\nof in\ufb01nite domain size. We proved that this limit is given generically by the absolute spectrum\nwhich can be computed using only the Wronskian D(\u039b, \u03bd) and which typically consists of a\nlocally \ufb01nite collection of semialgebraic curves.\nSince the absolute spectrum is related to separated boundary conditions, it depends cru-\ncially on the frame in which the boundary conditions are imposed. As we are primarily\ninterested in 1D sources and two-dimensional (2D) spiral waves for which only the laboratory\nframe is relevant, we shall compute the absolute spectrum of wave trains in this frame. To\nde\ufb01ne absolute spectra in the laboratory frame, we \ufb01x a point \u039b \u2208 C and collect all roots \u03bd\nof the Wronskian D(\u039b, \u03bd) subject to 0 \u2264 Im \u03bd < k. As shown in [38, section 3.4], these roots\nform a countable set {\u03bdj}j\u2208Z which depends on the choice of \u039b \u2208 C. Taking the restriction on\nthe imaginary part of the \u03bdj into account, we conclude from [23] that there are only \ufb01nitely\nmany roots \u03bdj , counted with multiplicity as solutions to an analytic equation, in any bounded\nregion of the complex plane. Furthermore, [38, section 3.4] implies that there are in\ufb01nitely\nmany roots with negative real parts and in\ufb01nitely many roots with positive real parts. We\nmay therefore order the roots \u03bdj , repeated with multiplicity, according to their real part\n(2.18)\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Re \u03bd\u2212k \u2264 Re \u03bd\u2212k+1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Re \u03bd\u22121 \u2264 Re \u03bd0 \u2264 Re \u03bd1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 Re \u03bdk \u2264 Re \u03bdk+1 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nwhich gives a well-de\ufb01ned labeling up to shifts in the indices and up to the ambiguity of\nlabeling roots with equal real parts. For Re\u039b \t 1, each \u03bdj has nonzero real part since the\nessential spectrum would otherwise extend arbitrarily far to the right in the complex plane.\nWe may therefore choose the labeling in (2.18) so that Re \u03bd0 < 0 < Re \u03bd1 for Re\u039b \t 1. We\nthen de\ufb01ne the absolute spectrum in the laboratory frame as the set\n(2.19) \u03a3abs = {\u039b \u2208 C; Re \u03bd0 = Re \u03bd1}.\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 503\nWe say that the absolute spectrum is simple if Re \u03bd\u22121 < Re \u03bd0,1 < Re \u03bd2 and call points where\n\u03bd0 = \u03bd1 edges of the absolute spectrum. Edges in simple absolute spectrum are called simple\nedges, and it is straightforward to see that a unique curve of absolute spectrum emerges from\neach simple edge. More generally, the absolute spectrum comes in curves, being de\ufb01ned by a\nsingle real condition for the complex parameter \u039b, and we may naturally parametrize these\ncurves using the parameter\ns = (Im \u03bd1 \u2212 Im \u03bd0)2\nso that edges correspond to s = 0.\nInspecting (2.19) shows that the absolute spectrum also respects the symmetries (2.15)\nof the essential spectrum, namely, complex conjugation and the arti\ufb01cial Floquet covering\nsymmetry \u039b \u0006\u2192 \u039b + i\u03c9. In particular, we have the following analogue of Lemma 2.1.\nLemma 2.2 (robustness of absolute spatio-temporal period-doubling). Suppose that a simple\nedge of the absolute spectrum \u039b(0) is located at Im\u039b(0) = \u2212\u03c9\/2 for Im \u03bd0 = k\/2; then the\nunique dispersion curve emanating from \u039b(0) is horizontal; that is, Im\u039b(s) = \u2212\u03c9\/2 for s \u2248 0.\nMoreover, the same conclusion holds for su\ufb03ciently small perturbations of the parameter value\n\u03bc and the coe\ufb03cients uwt(\u03be) in (2.6). In particular, the absolute spectrum crosses at the sharp\nresonance \u2212i\u03c9\/2 for an open subset of one-parameter families of reaction-di\ufb00usion systems.\nProof. The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 2.1 and will be omitted.\nWe emphasize that the crossing of the essential spectrum at \u00b1i\u03c9\/2 does not necessarily\nenforce the absolute spectrum to cross at resonance. The other generic possibility is that the\nabsolute spectrum consists locally of two curves which are symmetric about Im\u039b = \u00b1\u03c9\/2 but\ndo not contain any points with Im\u039b = \u00b1\u03c9\/2.\n2.4. Spatially homogeneous oscillations. We show here that the hypotheses stated in\nLemmas 2.1 and 2.2 are met for wave trains with small wave numbers that accompany spa-\ntially homogeneous oscillations. Indeed, assume that (2.2) admits a solution uwt(\u2212\u03c9t) which\nundergoes a generic temporal period-doubling bifurcation at \u03bc = 0. Moreover, assume that\nthe Floquet spectrum of the linearized period map \u03a6\u2032T (uwt) of (2.1) is contained in the open\nleft half-plane except for simple edges at \u039b = 0, \u039b = \u00b1i\u03c9\/2, and their Floquet conjugates\n(note that the absolute and essential spectra of homogeneous oscillations coincide since these\nwaves are invariant under the spatial re\ufb02ections x \u0006\u2192 \u2212x).\nLemma 2.3. Under the assumptions stated above, there exists a family of wave trains,\nparametrized by their wave number k with k \u2248 0, each of which undergoes a spatio-temporal\nperiod-doubling which satis\ufb01es the hypotheses of Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2.\nWe remark that the statement of the preceding lemma will be further extended in section 5.\nProof. The existence problem and the eigenvalue problem of wave trains with wave number\nk = \u03b5 \u2248 0 yield the singularly perturbed boundary-value problems\n\u03b52D\u22022\u03beu+ \u03c9\u2202\u03beu+ f(u) = 0, D(\u03b5\u2202\u03be + \u03bd)\n2v + \u03c9(\u2202\u03be + \u03bd\/\u03b5)v + f\n\u2032(u)v = \u03bbv,\nrespectively, with 2\u03c0-periodic boundary conditions in \u03be = \u03b5x. The eigenvalue problem can be\nrewritten in the form\nD(\u03b5\u2202\u03be + \u03bd)\n2v + \u03c9\u2202\u03bev + f\n\u2032(u)v = \u039bv,\nusing the de\ufb01nition (2.14) of \u039b. Writing these second-order equations as \ufb01rst-order equations\nand reducing the dynamics to a slow manifold using geometric singular perturbation theory\n504 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nFigure 2. From left to right: Plotted are space-time plots (time upward, space horizontal) of 1D spirals and\n1D targets of the Brusselator with parameters as in [38, Appendix B], and 1D spirals and moving period-doubled\nsources of the Ro\u00a8ssler system (6.1) with C = 3.0 and C = 4.2, respectively.\nas in [38, section 3.3] shows that bounded solutions lie on the slow manifold and that the\nevolution on the slow manifold is obtained to leading order by formally setting \u03b5 = 0 in the\nsystem above. The reduced system therefore consists of a regular perturbation of a generic\nperiod-doubling bifurcation with a simple Floquet multiplier, which proves the claim about\nexistence. The spectral problem with simple edges at \u039b = 0 and \u039b = \u2212i\u03c9\/2 for \u03bd = 0 and\n\u03bd = ik\/2, respectively, is robust as well and yields the same spectral picture for \u03b5 \u2248 0 with a\npossible o\ufb00set in the real part of the period-doubling eigenvalue.\n3. Period-doubling of sources in one space dimension. 2D spirals are defects in the\nsense that, far away from the location of the spiral tip, the medium resembles locally the\nessentially 1D planar wave trains that we encountered in the previous section. An additional\nproperty of 2D spirals is the active emission of wave trains in the sense that the group velocity\nof the planar wave trains that are observed in the far \ufb01eld points in the radial direction away\nfrom the center of the spiral.\nSources are 1D analogues of spiral waves, and we discuss in this section the 1D analogue\n(see Figure 2) of the period-doubling instability of 2D spiral waves. We are interested in\nseeing whether Floquet multipliers cross exactly at \u03c1 = \u22121 or only nearby, and whether the\nbifurcating period-doubled sources will drift or not.\n3.1. Sources. Recall the reaction-di\ufb00usion system\n(3.1) ut = Duxx + f(u;\u03bc), x \u2208 R.\nStanding sources u\u2217(x, t) are time-periodic solutions of (3.1) which converge to wave trains\nu\u00b1wt in the far \ufb01eld as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e whose group velocities c\u00b1g , computed in the laboratory frame,\npoint away from the interface so that c\u2212g < 0 and c+g > 0. More precisely, we have\n(3.2) u\u2217(x, t) = u\u2217(x, t+ T ), |u\u2217(x, t)\u2212 u\u00b1wt(k\u00b1x\u2212 \u03c9\u00b1t\u2212 \u03b8\u00b1; k\u00b1)| \u2192 0 as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e,\nwhere uwt(\u03be; k) denotes a family of wave trains which are 2\u03c0-periodic in the argument \u03be\nwith temporal frequencies \u03c9\u00b1, spatial wave numbers k\u00b1, and phase corrections \u03b8\u00b1 at \u00b1\u221e,\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 505\nrespectively. Characteristic for sources is the requirement that the group velocities, computed\nin the laboratory frame, are directed away from the defect so that c\u2212g < 0 and c+g > 0. As\nbefore, we let \u03c9 = 2\u03c0\/T denote the temporal frequency of the source. We showed in [38]\nthat sources occur for open, nonempty classes of reaction-di\ufb00usion systems and generically for\ndiscrete sets of asymptotic wave numbers k\u00b1.\nWe focus here exclusively on 1D targets and 1D spirals which are standing sources that\nare re\ufb02ectionally symmetric so that\n(3.3)\nu\u2217(x, t) = u\u2217(\u2212x, t) (1D target) or u\u2217(x, t) = u\u2217(\u2212x, t+ T\/2) (1D spiral)\nfor all (x, t). Thus, 1D target patterns are even in x for each t, while 1D spirals are invariant\nwhen simultaneously re\ufb02ecting the pattern and shifting in time by half the temporal period;\nsee Figure 2. Re\ufb02ectional symmetry implies in both cases that k+ = \u2212k\u2212 \u0005= 0.\n3.2. Spectra of sources on R. Dynamic properties such as robustness, stability, and\ninteraction with other defects are largely determined by spectral properties of the linearization\n\u03a6\u2032T of the time-T map of (3.1) about the defect. Throughout this section, we will switch back\nand forth between Floquet exponents \u039b and Floquet multipliers \u03c1 = e\u039bT in the spectrum of\n\u03a6\u2032T . We distinguish between the point spectrum, which consists of all \u03c1 \u2208 C for which \u03a6\u2032T \u2212 \u03c1\nis not invertible but still Fredholm of index zero, and the essential spectrum, which is the\ncomplement of the point spectrum in the spectrum. We showed in [38] that the Fredholm index\nof \u03a6\u2032T jumps precisely at the dispersion curves of the asymptotic 1D wave trains, computed in\nthe frame of the defect. In particular, the essential spectrum of sources inherits the symmetry\nproperties of the essential spectrum of the 1D wave trains.\nCorollary 3.1 (robust period-doubling of sources). There exists an open class of one-param-\neter families of reaction-di\ufb00usion systems where the spectrum of the linearization crosses the\nimaginary axis \ufb01rst at \u039b = \u00b1i\u03c9\/2.\nThe multiplicity of the essential spectrum depends on whether the underlying source is re-\nversible in the sense of (3.3) or not: Since the asymptotic wave trains at x = \u00b1\u221e of 1D targets\nand 1D spirals are related by re\ufb02ection symmetry, the essential spectra of both wave trains\ncross the imaginary axis simultaneously. Thus, the essential spectrum of reversible sources has\ngeometric multiplicity two, which has implications for the actual bifurcation scenario which\nwe will discuss in section 3.4.\nWe now discuss the point spectrum. There are no structural reasons that prevent 1D\ntargets from having a simple point Floquet multiplier at \u03c1 = \u22121 that crosses the imaginary\naxis, thus leading to a generic period-doubling bifurcation of time-periodic solutions of (3.1).\nSince 1D targets are symmetric under the spatial re\ufb02ections de\ufb01ned by\n(Ru)(x) := u(\u2212x),\nthe linearized period map leaves the spaces Fix(R) and Fix(\u2212R) of even and odd functions\ninvariant [13]. The eigenfunction belonging to a simple multiplier \u03c1 = \u22121 is therefore either\neven or odd: the bifurcating sources are 1D targets in the \ufb01rst case and 1D spirals in the\nsecond case, and they have approximately twice the temporal period in both cases.\nFloquet multipliers of 1D spirals at \u03c1 = \u22121 must, however, have geometric multiplicity\ntwo since the linearized period-T map \u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217) can be written as a square: Indeed, \u03a6t(u) is\n506 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nequivariant with respect to the spatial re\ufb02ection R so that \u03a6t(Ru) = R\u03a6t(u) and therefore\n\u03a6\u2032T\/2(Ru) = R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u)R. Using that \u03a6T\/2(u\u2217) = Ru\u2217 for the 1D spiral u\u2217, we obtain\n\u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217) = \u03a6\n\u2032\nT\/2(\u03a6T\/2(u\u2217))\u03a6\n\u2032\nT\/2(u\u2217) = R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217)R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217) = [R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217)]2.\nWe \ufb01rst focus on the center subspace associated with critical point spectrum of R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217).\nClearly this subspace is invariant under \u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217). An eigenvalue \u22121 of \u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217) can be generated\nonly by eigenvalues \u00b1i of R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217), which come necessarily in complex conjugated pairs so\nthat the eigenvalue \u22121 cannot be simple. If the essential spectrum of R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217) is bounded\naway from \u00b1i, then the essential spectrum of \u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217) is bounded away from \u22121 by Fredholm\nalgebra properties, and the spectral projection P belonging to eigenvalues near \u22121 can be\nobtained by factoring\n\u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217)\u2212 \u03c1 = [R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217)\u2212\n\u221a\n\u03c1] [R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217) +\n\u221a\n\u03c1]\nfor \u03c1 on a small circle \u0393 around \u22121, and computing\nP =\n\u222b\n\u0393\n[\u03c1\u2212 \u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217)]\u22121 d\u03c1\n=\n\u222b\n\u0393\n[R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217)\u2212\n\u221a\n\u03c1]\u22121[R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217) +\n\u221a\n\u03c1]\u22121 d\u03c1\n=\n\u222b\n\u221a\n\u0393\n(\n[R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217)\u2212\n\u221a\n\u03c1]\u22121 \u2212 [R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217) +\n\u221a\n\u03c1]\u22121\n)\nd\n\u221a\n\u03c1.\nIn particular, the spectral projection of \u03a6T (u\u2217) associated with \u03c1 = \u22121 is given by the sums\nof the spectral projections of R\u03a6\u2032T\/2 associated with \u03c1 = \u00b1i. This shows that classical period-\ndoubling in the form of a simple Floquet multiplier at \u22121 in the point spectrum cannot occur\nfor 1D spirals.\nRemark 3.2. The preceding analysis also shows that the double Floquet multiplier at \u03c1 = \u22121\nfor 1D spirals will generically split into two nonreal, complex conjugate multipliers since there\nis no structural reason which prevents the eigenvalues \u00b1i of R\u03a6\u2032T\/2(u\u2217) from moving o\ufb00 the\nimaginary axis, thus moving the multipliers of the square \u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217) o\ufb00 the negative real axis.\nIn preparation for the discussion in section 3.3, we collect some properties of the spectra\nof symmetric sources in the exponentially weighted spaces\nL\u02c62\u03b7 := {u \u2208 L2loc; |u|L\u02c62\u03b7 <\u221e}, |u|\n2\nL\u02c62\u03b7\n:=\n\u222b\nR\n|u(x)|2e\u22122\u03b7|x| dx.\nThe essential spectrum of the linearized period-T map of a symmetric source (3.3) on the\nspace L\u02c62\u03b7 is determined by the dispersion curves of the asymptotic wave trains in the spaces\nL2\u03b7 from (2.17). Exploiting that the wave trains u\n\u00b1\nwt(x; k\u00b1) are related by symmetry,\nu+wt(x; k+) = u\n\u2212\nwt(\u2212x; k\u2212), k+ = \u2212k\u2212,\nit follows that the spatial Floquet exponents \u03bd\u00b1j (\u039b) that appear in the de\ufb01nition (2.19) of the\nabsolute spectra of wave trains are related via\n\u03bd+j (\u039b) = \u2212\u03bd\u22121\u2212j(\u039b) \u2200j.\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 507\nIn particular, we have \u03bd+0 (\u039b) = \u2212\u03bd\u22121 (\u039b) and \u03bd+1 (\u039b) = \u2212\u03bd\u22120 (\u039b) so that the absolute spectra of\nthe asymptotic wave trains coincide and so that, for each \u039b \/\u2208 \u03a3abs, we can \ufb01nd a weight \u03b7\nwith \u03bd+0 < \u03b7 < \u03bd\n+\n1 such that the linearized period map \u03a6\n\u2032\nT (u\u2217)\u2212 e\u039bT is Fredholm with index\nzero in L\u02c62\u03b7. Note also that we can choose the weight \u03b7 to be constant locally in \u039b. We de\ufb01ne\nthe extended point spectrum to be the set of \u039b \/\u2208 \u03a3abs such that the linearized period map\nis not invertible in the space L\u02c62\u03b7 with \u03b7 chosen as described above. We can then also de\ufb01ne\ngeometric and algebraic multiplicities for elements of the extended point spectrum.\n3.3. Spectra of sources on \ufb01nite intervals. The resonant crossing of essential spectra\nof sources provides some evidence for why period-doubling can occur in a robust fashion.\nExperiments and numerical simulations are, however, posed on large but \ufb01nite domains, typ-\nically with separated boundary conditions. The linearized period map on bounded domains\nis a compact operator, and the essential Floquet spectrum is therefore empty: Instead, the\nabsolute spectra of the asymptotic wave trains become relevant. For simplicity, we restrict\nourselves to Neumann boundary conditions, thus considering\nut = Duxx + f(u;\u03bc), x \u2208 (\u2212L,L),(3.4)\n0 = ux(\u00b1L, t),\nwhich are realistic for the experimental setup and which are also a standard choice for numer-\nical simulations.\nWe shall focus exclusively on 1D targets and 1D spirals. We assume that there exists a\nsymmetric source uso such that \u039b = 0 belongs to the extended point spectrum with algebraic\nand geometric multiplicity two. We showed in [38] that this assumption is satis\ufb01ed for an open\nand nonempty set of reaction-di\ufb00usion systems and called this type of source elementary. To\ndescribe the in\ufb02uence of the boundary, we need an assumption on the boundary layer between\nwave trains and the boundary. We assume that (3.1) admits a symmetric sink usi, that is, a\nsolution of the form (3.2) which is even in x, with asymptotic wave numbers k\u00b1si := k\n\u2213\nso. In\nparticular, the group velocities of the sink point toward the center of the sink. We assume\nthat \u039b = 0 does not belong to either the absolute or the extended point spectrum of the\nlinearization \u03a6\u2032T (usi) of the period map. Again, this assumption is robust [38]. Since the sink\nis even, it gives solutions u\u00b1si of the system\nut = Duxx + f(u;\u03bc), x \u2208 R\u00b1,(3.5)\n0 = ux(0, t)\non the half-spaces R+ and R\u2212 which satisfy Neumann boundary conditions at x = 0, and we\nrefer to these two solutions on R+ and R\u2212 as boundary sinks [38]. In this setup, we proved\nthe following result on the existence and spectral properties of solutions on large bounded\nintervals.\nTheorem 1 (see [38, section 6.8]). Under the above assumptions, the reaction-di\ufb00usion sys-\ntem (3.4) has, for each L \t 1, a unique time-periodic solution u\u2217(x, t;L) which is close to\nthe symmetric source uso on (\u2212L\/2, L\/2) and to the appropriately translated boundary sinks\nu+si and u\n\u2212\nsi on (\u2212L,\u2212L\/2) and (L\/2, L), respectively.\n508 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nThe assumption on the existence of a symmetric sink can be veri\ufb01ed in the special case\nof nearly homogeneous oscillations (see also section 5.4). Recall that a homogeneous oscil-\nlation with a simple Floquet exponent \u039b = 0 is accompanied by a family of wave trains\nuwt(kx\u2212 \u03c9(k)t) for small wave numbers k \u2248 0.\nTheorem 2 (see [6]). Assume that there is a spatially homogeneous oscillation uwt(\u2212\u03c9(0)t)\nsuch that the Floquet multiplier \u039b = 0 is a simple edge. For each k \u2248 0, there exists a unique\nsymmetric sink which is spatially asymptotic to the wave trains uwt(\u00b1kx\u2212\u03c9(\u00b1k)t) at x = \u00b1\u221e.\nNext, we investigate the spectrum of the linearized period map near the truncated sources\nthat we described in Theorem 1. An outline of the proof of the following theorem will be\ngiven in Appendix A.\nTheorem 3. Assume that the extended point spectrum of the sources uso on R is discrete;\nthen the spectrum of the period map of the truncated sources described in Theorem 1 converges\nlocally uniformly in the symmetric Hausdor\ufb00 distance to the disjoint union of the absolute\nspectrum \u03a3abs of the wave trains uwt, computed in the laboratory frame, and a discrete set of\nisolated points.\nThe convergence toward the absolute spectrum is algebraic of order O(1\/L), and the num-\nber of eigenvalues in any small neighborhood of any element of the absolute spectrum converges\nto in\ufb01nity as L\u2192\u221e. The discrete part of the limiting spectrum is the union of the extended\npoint spectrum of the source uso on R and the extended point spectra of the two symmetric\nboundary sinks u\u00b1si on R\n\u00b1 with Neumann boundary conditions. The convergence toward the\ndiscrete part is exponential in L, and the multiplicity of eigenvalues in any small neighborhood\nof the discrete part is \ufb01nite and stabilizes as L\u2192\u221e.\nWe remark that the absolute spectrum is close to the essential spectrum if the wave number\nof the asymptotic wave trains is su\ufb03ciently close to zero; see Lemma 2.3 and also section 5\nbelow. We now discuss the implications of Theorem 3 for period-doubling of symmetric sources\nof (3.4).\nWe begin with 1D targets. Floquet exponents \u03c1 = \u22121 in the Floquet point spectrum of\na 1D target uso on R will generically have multiplicity one and therefore persist as a simple\nmultiplier \u03c1 \u2208 R\u2212 near \u22121 for (3.4), with the eigenfunction lying again in the space of even\nor odd functions. Next, assume that the boundary sink u+si on R\n\u2212 with Neumann conditions\nhas a simple Floquet multiplier \u03c1 = \u22121 in its point spectrum. Since the sinks u+si and u\u2212si\nare related by re\ufb02ection x \u0006\u2192 \u2212x, the re\ufb02ected sink u\u2212si also has a simple Floquet multiplier\n\u03c1 = \u22121, and Theorem 3 shows that the truncated source u\u2217 has two Floquet multipliers near\n\u03c1 = \u22121. Since 1D targets are symmetric under spatial re\ufb02ections, the linearized period map\nleaves the spaces of even and odd functions invariant. The Floquet eigenfunctions of the\nboundary sinks on R\u00b1 yield one even and one odd eigenfunction of the truncated 1D target of\n(3.4), which can be seen via transversality arguments in a spatial-dynamics formulation of the\neigenvalue problem. In particular, the two Floquet multipliers of the persisting source on the\nbounded interval are both real and close to \u22121 but may split on the negative real line. Thus,\ntwo period-doubling bifurcations will take place, both with multipliers at \u03c1 = \u22121, one with\nan even and the other one with an odd eigenfunction. In summary, period-doubling of 1D\ntargets for (3.1) via point eigenvalues persists with a sharp resonance at \u03c1 = \u22121 for (3.4), and\nthe resulting bifurcation leads to 1D targets and\/or 1D spirals depending on the symmetries\nof the associated eigenfunctions.\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 509\nNext, we consider 1D spirals. Symmetry enforces that Floquet multipliers \u03c1 \u2208 R\u2212 of 1D\nspirals on R are double. This symmetry is also present for (3.4), and Remark 3.2 shows that\na Floquet multiplier \u03c1 = \u22121 therefore either persists as a double multiplier \u03c1 \u2208 R\u2212 near \u22121\nor will split into two complex conjugate multipliers. The same conclusion is true for the two\nmultipliers near \u03c1 = \u22121 that arise when the two boundary sinks undergo period-doubling with\nsimple multipliers at \u03c1 = \u22121. We expect that the two multipliers near \u22121 will generically\nsplit, so that there is no sharp resonance at \u03c1 = \u22121 for the truncated 1D spiral of (3.4).\nLast, we consider the absolute spectrum. The following corollary is a straightforward\nconsequence of Theorem 3.\nCorollary 3.3 (generic absolute period-doubling). Resonant crossing of eigenvalues near the\nabsolute spectrum at \u039b = \u00b1i\u03c9\/2+O(1\/L) occurs in an open subset of one-parameter families\nof reaction-di\ufb00usion systems.\nFor 1D spirals, we expect that, generically, the eigenvalues near the absolute spectrum\nwill indeed move o\ufb00 the lines Im\u039b = \u00b1\u03c9\/2. For 1D targets, we can, however, apply the same\nsymmetry-based arguments as above which yield that the absolute eigenmodes decompose\nagain into odd and even functions: This precludes movement of the associated Floquet mul-\ntipliers o\ufb00 the lines Im\u039b = \u00b1\u03c9\/2, and we therefore obtain a sharp resonance with multipliers\non these lines.\n3.4. Nonlinear bifurcations of 1D sources, and the role of group velocity. We now\nanalyze the period-doubling instability of 1D targets and 1D spirals on the unbounded real\nline x \u2208 R that arises when essential spectrum crosses the imaginary axis. We are interested in\nconstructing coherent structures which are periodic in time and spatially asymptotic to period-\ndoubled wave trains in the far \ufb01eld as shown in Figure 2. Our goal is to derive bifurcation and\nbifurcation failure results which are valid uniformly in the size of the domain. Our approach\nwill also allow us to gain insight into the role of transport as represented by the group velocity\nof the linear period-doubling modes.\nThroughout this section, we assume the existence of a family of wave trains with nonzero\ngroup velocity cg which undergo a period-doubling instability with dispersion curve \u039bpd(\u03bd)\nwhich satis\ufb01es\n\u039bpd(ik\u2217\/2) = \u2212i\u03c9\u2217\/2, cpdg = \u2212\u039b\u2032pd(ik\u2217\/2) \u0005= 0, Re\u039bpd(\u03bd) < 0 \u2200\u03bd \u0005= ik\u2217\/2.\nFurthermore, we assume that the period-doubling bifurcation is supercritical (more precisely,\nthat the period-doubling bifurcation in the space of spatially periodic functions is a supercrit-\nical pitchfork bifurcation). We will now state three theorems on period-doubling bifurcations\nfrom defects on R which we shall prove later in this section.\nTheorem 4 (bifurcation from 1D targets on R). Assume that there exists a 1D target with\n\u03a3ext \u2229 iR = {0}, where \u039b = 0 has multiplicity two, whose asymptotic wave trains undergo\nperiod-doubling at \u03bc = 0. If cpdg < 0, then there exists a unique branch of bifurcating 1D\ntarget patterns and a unique branch of 1D spirals which are asymptotic to the period-doubled\nwave trains. If cpdg > 0, then 1D target patterns and 1D spirals that are asymptotic to the\nperiod-doubled wave trains do not exist near onset.\nTheorem 5 (bifurcation from 1D spirals on R). Assume that there exists a 1D spiral with\ntemporal frequency \u03c9\u2217 and with \u03a3ext \u2229 iR = {0}, where \u039b = 0 has multiplicity two, whose\n510 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nasymptotic wave trains undergo period-doubling at \u03bc = 0. If cpdg < 0, then there exists a\nunique branch, up to spatial re\ufb02ection, of bifurcating solutions which are asymptotic to the\nperiod-doubled wave trains. The wave speed c\u2217 of the bifurcating solutions is close to zero\nwith |c\u2217| \u2264 K|\u03bc| for some constant K, and their temporal frequency is close to \u03c9\u2217\/2 in the\ncomoving frame \u03be = x \u2212 c\u2217t. If cpdg > 0, then standing or moving 1D target patterns or 1D\nspirals that are asymptotic to the period-doubled wave trains do not exist near onset.\nWe have observed the bifurcation from 1D spirals to moving period-doubled sources de-\nscribed in Theorem 5 in numerical simulations of the Ro\u00a8ssler system; see the two rightmost\nplots in Figure 2.\nWhile bifurcations from sources to period-doubled sources occur on R if and only if the\ngroup velocity of the period doubling modes is directed toward the center of the defect, the\nfollowing result shows that bifurcations from boundary sinks to period-doubled boundary sinks\ntake place if and only if the group velocity is directed toward the boundary.\nTheorem 6 (bifurcation of boundary layers on R\u2212). Assume that there exists a 1D boundary\nsink of (3.5) on R\u2212 such that \u03a3ext \u2229 iR = \u2205. If cpdg > 0, then there exists a unique branch of\nbifurcating boundary sinks which are asymptotic to the period-doubled wave trains. If cpdg < 0,\nthen boundary sinks that are asymptotic to the bifurcating period-doubled wave trains do not\nexist near onset.\nCombining the statements on the bifurcation of coherent structures and boundary sinks,\nwe see that we cannot expect the simultaneous bifurcation to both coherent structures on R\nand boundary layers on R\u2212 near the onset of an essential instability. In particular, if period-\ndoubled sources bifurcate on R, then period-doubled boundary sinks will not be present,\nand consequently the period-doubled sources will not persist on large bounded domains with\nNeumann boundary conditions. We refer the reader to section 5.4 for the analysis of a scenario\nwhere sources on R persist on bounded domains due to instabilities of boundary sinks caused\nby the point spectrum.\nThe results stated above re\ufb02ect an intuitive heuristic picture of transport. The linear\ngroup velocity of eigenmodes encodes the direction toward which a localized perturbation\nconstructed from the eigenmode will propagate. Thus, if we begin with a source on R, then\nthe group velocities cpdg of the period-doubling modes at x = \u00b1\u221e determine whether period-\ndoubling modes can propagate toward the core of the source or not: If the group velocity cpdg\nat x =\u221e is positive, then the period-doubling modes cannot propagate toward the core, and a\nnonlinear bifurcation to a period-doubled pattern is not possible. The same arguments apply\nto boundary sinks provided we interpret the boundary as the core of the coherent structure.\nSince transport occurs either away from the boundary toward the core, or else away from\nthe core toward the boundary, we cannot expect the simultaneous bifurcation of sources and\nboundary sinks.\nIn the remainder of this section, we sketch the proofs of Theorems 4\u20136. The arguments are\nsimilar to those given in [36], and we will therefore refer the reader to [36] for the more technical\naspects of the proofs. Since we are interested only in time-periodic solutions, we rewrite the\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 511\nreaction-di\ufb00usion equation as a \ufb01rst-order evolution equation in the spatial variable x,\nux = v,(3.6)\nvx = D\n\u22121[\u03c9u\u03c4 \u2212 cv \u2212 f(u;\u03bc)],\nwhere (u, v)(\u00b7) \u2208 H1(S1,Rn)\u00d7H1\/2(S1,Rn) are 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03c4 for each \ufb01xed x. We showed\nin [30, 36, 37] that coherent structures can be found as intersections of stable and unstable\nmanifolds of the periodic orbits (in the evolution variable x) that correspond to the asymptotic\nwave trains. Essential instabilities of the wave trains correspond to pitchfork bifurcations of\nthe corresponding periodic orbits. Although (3.6) is ill-posed, the aforementioned stable and\nunstable manifolds exist, and the standard arguments for bifurcations in dynamical systems\ncan be made rigorous [36, 37, 38, 39]. Equation (3.6) is invariant under the action of the\nsymmetry group SO(2) via the time shift action S\u03b8 : (u, v)(\u03c4) \u0006\u2192 (u, v)(\u03c4 + \u03b8) for each \ufb01xed\n\u03b8 \u2208 SO(2) \u223c= R\/2\u03c0Z. In particular, the subspace of solutions which are invariant under the\nshift S\u03c0 : \u03c4 \u0006\u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c0 by half the period is invariant under the x-evolution. If we choose\n\u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9\u2217\/2, where \u03c9\u2217 is the temporal frequency of the primary source, then the primary wave\ntrains and coherent structures lie in this \ufb01xed-point space, and we expect the period-doubled\nstructures to bifurcate out of this subspace.\nFor the sake of clarity, we shall pretend in the rest of this section that the dynamics of\n(3.6) can be reduced to an appropriate six-dimensional invariant subspace, for instance, by\nusing a suitable combination of Fourier modes in the periodic variable \u03c4 . We assume that this\nsubspace intersects the \ufb01xed-point subspace of the shift by half a period in a four-dimensional\nsubspace. Since all solutions truly depend on \u03c4 , we may furthermore factor out the free action\nof SO(2)\/Z2. We will now describe the dynamics of the reduced spatial dynamical system\n(3.7) Ux = F (U ;\u03bc), U \u2208 R3 \u00d7 R2,\nin the reduced phase space which we assume is given by R3 \u00d7 R2. As mentioned above, the\ntechnical tools necessary to extend the analysis of this \u201ctoy problem\u201d to the full system (3.6)\nhave been described in [36, 37, 38, 39] to which we refer the reader for details.\nThe primary wave trains uwt(kx \u2212 \u03c4) correspond to relative periodic orbits of (3.6) with\nrespect to the shift symmetry S\u03b8 and therefore, upon factoring out the shift, to equilibria of\nthe reduced spatial system (3.7) in R3 \u00d7 {0}. Any neutral Floquet exponent \u039b \u2208 i\u03c9Z of the\ndispersion curve \u039b\u2217(i\u03b3) of the linearization of the reaction-di\ufb00usion system (2.1) about the\nasymptotic wave train uwt gives a neutral Floquet exponent \u03bd = i\u03b3 \u2208 iR of the corresponding\nrelative periodic orbit of (3.6). By assumption, there are precisely two such neutral eigenvalues,\nnamely, the phase eigenvalue \u039b = 0 at \u03bd = 0 and the period-doubling mode \u039b = \u2212i\u03c9\u2217\/2 at\n\u03bd = ik\u2217\/2. Upon factoring out the shift symmetry SO(2)\/Z2, we see that the eigenvalue\n\u039b = 0, which corresponds to shifts, is removed, while the period-doubling eigenvalue gives\na Floquet exponent at \u03bd = 0 with eigenvector contained in {0} \u00d7 R2. Inside the invariant\nsubspace R3 \u00d7 {0}, the equilibrium is hyperbolic with one unstable eigenvalue if cg < 0 and\ntwo unstable eigenvalues if cg > 0; see [38]. Similarly, besides the neutral eigenvalue \u03bd = 0,\nthe equilibrium has one unstable eigenvalue on {0} \u00d7 R2 if cpdg > 0 and one stable eigenvalue\nif cpdg < 0.\n512 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nThe reversers R0 : (u, v) \u0006\u2192 (u,\u2212v) andR\u03c0 := R0S\u03c0 each \ufb01x a three-dimensional subspace\nin R6 which is invariant under the action of SO(2), thus yielding a two-dimensional subspace\nin R5 whose intersection with the isotropy subspace FixS\u03c0 is one-dimensional. Similarly, the\nspace {(u, v); v = 0} of functions that satisfy Neumann boundary conditions corresponds to\na two-dimensional subspace in R5 which intersects FixS\u03c0 in a line.\nWe now prove Theorem 4 for target patterns on R. Before bifurcation for \u03bc < 0, 1D\ntargets are found as intersections in R5 of the two-dimensional space FixR0 with the two-\ndimensional stable manifold of the equilibrium corresponding to the wave train with positive\ngroup velocity cg > 0. The assumption that the extended point spectrum in the origin has\nmultiplicity two means that the intersection of the tangent spaces of the stable manifold and\nFixR0 is trivial and is broken with nonvanishing speed when we vary \u03c9 near \u03c9\u2217\/2 [38].\nFirst, assume cpdg > 0. From the preceding discussion of the dispersion relation, we see\nthat the wave train is stable inside the one-dimensional center manifold for \u03bc < 0 before the\nonset of period-doubling. The stable manifold of the asymptotic wave train can therefore be\ncontinued smoothly through the bifurcation as a center-stable manifold. The assumption of\nminimal extended point spectrum implies that the intersection between FixR0 and the center-\nstable manifold of the equilibrium is transverse in the parameter \u03c9 at \u03bc = 0, and we conclude\nthat the unique intersection persists through the bifurcation. Since this unique intersection is\ngiven by the primary 1D target pattern and therefore located inside FixS\u03c0, we conclude that\nperiod-doubled target patterns cannot bifurcate.\nNext, assume that cpdg < 0. The wave train is then unstable inside the center manifold\nfor \u03bc < 0 before bifurcation, which means that the stable manifold continues continuously\nthrough the bifurcation as the strong stable \ufb01ber. At \u03bc = 0, the strong stable \ufb01ber of the\nprimary wave train crosses FixR0 transversely upon varying \u03c9, and we conclude that the\nprimary 1D target persists. On the other hand, the strong stable \ufb01ber of the bifurcating\nperiod-doubled wave trains is\n\u221a\n\u03bc-close to the strong stable \ufb01ber of the primary wave train,\nand it therefore also crosses FixR0 transversely for \u03c9\u02dc = \u03c9 +O(\u221a\u03bc).\nThe same arguments apply when we replace FixR0 by FixR\u03c0, which completes the proof\nof Theorem 4.\nThe case of 1D spirals is similar. The primary 1D spirals are transverse intersection of\nthe stable manifold of the wave train and the \ufb01xed-point space of the operator R0S\u03c0\/2, which\nacts as a reverser in FixS\u03c0 but not in the entire phase space: Indeed, the \ufb02ip symmetry of\nthe shift S\u03c0\/2 by half a period has order four after doubling the period and therefore cannot\nact as an involution when composed with the reverser R0 : (u, v) \u0006\u2192 (u,\u2212v). We therefore\ncannot expect to obtain period-doubled patterns as intersections with reversibility \ufb01xed-point\nspaces; instead the bifurcating patterns should drift. Thus, we transform into a comoving\nframe, include the wave speed c \u2248 0 as an additional parameter, and seek intersections of\nthe unstable manifold of the primary wave train with negative group velocity at x = \u2212\u221e\nwith the stable manifold of the primary wave train with positive group velocity at x = \u221e.\nSince the intersection now occurs along \ufb02ow lines of the di\ufb00erential equation, we lose one\ndimension for transversality, which is however compensated for by the additional parameter\nc. The existence and nonexistence proofs for period-doubled sources proceed now as before,\nand [33, Lemma 3.9] shows that the speed c of the bifurcating sources will be of the order\nO(\u03bc). We omit the straightforward adaptation of the arguments.\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 513\nIt remains to discuss boundary sinks on R\u2212, which we seek as transverse intersections of\nthe unstable manifold of the wave trains at x = \u2212\u221e with positive group velocity and the\nboundary subspace. Since cg > 0 at x = \u2212\u221e, we have transversality of the intersection for\n\ufb01xed \u03c9, and we consequently \ufb01nd a family of boundary sinks, parametrized by their temporal\nfrequency \u03c9. For cpdg > 0, we \ufb01nd a family of period-doubled boundary sinks by continuing\nthe strong unstable manifold of the wave trains continuously through the bifurcation as the\nstrong unstable manifold of the period-doubled wave trains after bifurcation. For cpdg < 0,\nperiod-doubled boundary sinks can bifurcate only near certain discrete values of \u03c9 where\nthe transversality conditions are violated, and an additional extended point spectrum occurs\nin the origin: An example where this can occur is near k = 0, and we refer the reader to\nsection 5.4 for an analysis of the resulting scenario.\n3.5. Nonlinear bifurcations of 1D sources on \ufb01nite intervals. We now describe bifurca-\ntions on large bounded domains induced by the crossing of the absolute spectrum. Theorem 3\nshows that there will be a large number of eigenvalues near each point of the absolute spec-\ntrum. Thus, for large domain diameters L \t 1, we expect a sequence of bifurcations with\na delayed onset \u03bc\u2217(L) = \u03bc\u221e\u2217 + O(1\/L2) of the instability compared with the crossing of the\nabsolute spectrum at \u03bc = \u03bc\u221e\u2217 . The small-amplitude regime of this bifurcation sequence can be\nanalyzed using the methods described in [40] for the analogous case of a pitchfork bifurcation\n(matching with the reversibility lines here is equivalent to matching with the boundary con-\nditions described there). As in [40], we expect that the amplitude of the bifurcating pattern\nin the far \ufb01eld scales with\n\u221a\n\u03bc\u2212 \u03bc\u2217(L)L3\/2. Instead of carrying out the analysis of the entire\nbifurcation sequence, we focus here on the \ufb01rst bifurcation.\nWe start with the case of a 1D target pattern. If the absolute spectrum crosses the\naxis at \u03c1 = \u22121, then section 3.3 shows that clusters of Floquet multipliers pass through\n\u03c1 = \u22121 on the real axis. From the expansion at the edge of the absolute spectrum [34,\nsection 5.4], we conclude that the \ufb01rst instability induced by the absolute spectrum occurs\non a two-dimensional center-eigenspace, with multipliers passing through \u22121 within O(1\/L)\nof each other as functions of the bifurcation parameter \u03bc, where the re\ufb02ection symmetry\nacts trivially in one direction and nontrivially in the other direction. In physical space, this\ncan be interpreted as synchronizing the instability in the far \ufb01eld without a phase shift or\nwith a phase shift of \u03c0. The resulting bifurcation can be analyzed using Lyapunov\u2013Schmidt\nreduction (for \ufb01nite, large L) and exploiting the symmetry. We \ufb01nd again that 1D target\npatterns bifurcate in the space of symmetric functions, while 1D spirals, which are invariant\nunder the \ufb02ip symmetry (x, t) \u0006\u2192 (\u2212x, t+T ), bifurcate in the space on which the symmetry acts\nnontrivially. We remark that the actual bifurcation is guaranteed on both spaces by degree\narguments and the fact that the leading multipliers actually cross the imaginary axis. The\nabsolute period-doubling of a 1D target pattern already shows \u201cnongenericity\u201d in the sense\nthat we would typically expect the leading multipliers to be simple at resonance \u03c1 = \u22121. The\nbifurcation analysis as described above remains valid only in a very small range of parameter\nvalues since the spectral gap to the next multiplier is only of order 1\/L2.\nNext, we consider 1D spirals. For 1D spirals, we cannot eliminate the translation symmetry\nby restricting to an appropriate \ufb01xed-point space since the isotropy of a 1D spiral is trivial for\neach \ufb01xed time t, and instead we need to consider the entire center manifold at once. Near\na period-doubling bifurcation induced by the absolute spectrum, the linearization \u03a6\u2032T (u\u2217) has\n514 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nfour Floquet multipliers in an O(1\/L2)-neighborhood of the unit circle given by \u03c1 = 1 from\ntemporal translation, \u03c1 = O(e\u2212\u03b4L) for the translation eigenvalue, and \u03c1 = \u22121\u2212\u03bc+O(1\/L) for\nthe period-doubling multiplier, which has geometric multiplicity two as shown in section 3.3.\nThe associated generalized eigenspace is therefore four-dimensional and can be parametrized\nby \u2202tu\u2217, \u2202xu\u2217, and the two period-doubling eigenfunctions vpd and v\u00afpd. If we denote the\nassociated coordinates by (\u03c4, \u03be, v) \u2208 S1\u00d7R\u00d7C for the temporal phase \u03c4 , the spatial translation\n\u03be, and the complex Hopf amplitude v, then we see upon using [44, Theorem 2.9] that the vector\n\ufb01eld on the center manifold for L\t 1 is given by\n\u03c4\u02d9 = \u03c9L(\u03c4, \u03be, v, \u03bc),\n\u03be\u02d9 = gL(\u03c4, \u03be, v, \u03bc),(3.8)\nv\u02d9 = hL(\u03c4, \u03be, v, \u03bc),\nwhere\n\u03c9L(\u03c4, \u03be, 0, 0) = \u03c9\u2217 +O(e\u2212\u03b4L), gL(\u03c4, \u03be, 0, 0) = O(e\u2212\u03b4L), g(\u03c4 + 2\u03c0, \u03be, v, \u03bc) = gL(\u03c4, \u03be, v, \u03bc),\nhL(\u03c4, \u03be, v, \u03bc) = [i\u03c9\u2217\/2 + O(\u03bc+ e\u2212\u03b4L)]v + \u03b3L(\u03c4, \u03bc)|v|2v +O(|v|5).\nWe do not know whether the center manifold exists in a uniform neighborhood of the source\nor whether the Taylor expansion on the center manifold converges as L \u2192 \u221e. If we assume\nthat the temporal average of \u03b3L(\u03c4, 0) is strictly negative uniformly in L\t 1, then we obtain\n\u03be\u02d9 \u2248 \u03b1L\u03bc for a constant \u03b1L due to resonant terms of the form g1ei\u03c4 v\u00af2 in gL(\u03c4, \u03be, v, \u03bc) as in the\nanalysis in the introduction or in [44, section 7]. If \u03b1L is not zero, the bifurcating 1D spirals\nshould therefore drift on (\u2212L,L) and eventually leave the local center manifold. We believe\nthat this drift can be followed on a global group-invariant center manifold until the e\ufb00ects of\nthe boundary become of the order of the drift speed \u03bc.\n4. Period-doubling of spiral waves. The spectral analysis of planar spiral waves is in\nmany respects analogous to that of 1D spirals. We consider the reaction-di\ufb00usion equation\n(2.1)\n(4.1) ut = D\u0394u+ f(u;\u03bc), (x, y) \u2208 R2,\n\ufb01rst on the plane, and subsequently on large disks BR(0) of radius R \t 1 together with\nappropriate boundary conditions. An Archimedean spiral wave is a rigidly rotating solution\nof the form\nu(x, y, t) = u\u2217(r, \u03d5\u2212 \u03c9t), (x, y) = (r cos\u03d5, r sin\u03d5),\nwhich converges to 1D wave trains uwt,\n|u\u2217(r, \u00b7 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217t)\u2212 uwt(k\u2217r + \u03b8(r) + \u00b7 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217t)|C1(S1) \u2192 0 as r \u2192\u221e,\nwhere k\u2217 \u0005= 0 denotes the asymptotic wave number of the wave trains, and \u03b8(r) is a smooth\nphase correction with \u03b8\u2032(r) \u2192 0 as r \u2192 \u221e. We shall assume that the essential spectrum of\nthe asymptotic 1D wave train is simple at \u039b = 0 and that the group velocity cg of the wave\ntrain uwt, computed in the laboratory frame, is positive.\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 515\nSpiral waves are equilibria in the corotating frame \u03c8 = \u03d5 \u2212 \u03c9\u2217t, where they satisfy the\nelliptic system\n(4.2) D\n[\nurr +\n1\nr\nur +\n1\nr2\nu\u03c8\u03c8\n]\n+ \u03c9\u2217u\u03c8 + f(u(r, \u03c8);\u03bc) = 0\nwith\n(4.3) |u\u2217(r, \u00b7)\u2212 uwt(k\u2217r + \u03b8(r) + \u00b7)|C1(S1) \u2192 0 as r \u2192\u221e.\nThe convergence assumed in (4.3) implies that the asymptotic shape of the spiral u\u2217 is indeed\ngiven by the 1D wave-train solution uwt, while the asymptotic wave number k\u2217 and the\ntemporal frequency \u03c9\u2217 are related via \u03c9\u2217 = \u03c9nl(k\u2217).\nNext, we linearize (4.1) about the spiral wave in the corotating frame, which is equivalent\nto linearizing (4.2) about u\u2217(r, \u03c8). The resulting operator L\u2217 is given by\nL\u2217u = D\n[\nurr +\n1\nr\nur +\n1\nr2\nu\u03c8\u03c8\n]\n+ \u03c9\u2217u\u03c8 + fu(u\u2217(r, \u03c8);\u03bc)u,\nwhich is a closed operator on L2(R2,Rn). If we take the formal limit r \u2192\u221e in the eigenvalue\nequation\n(4.4) D\n[\nurr +\n1\nr\nur +\n1\nr2\nu\u03c8\u03c8\n]\n+ \u03c9\u2217u\u03c8 + fu(u\u2217(r, \u03c8);\u03bc)u = \u039bu,\nwe obtain the limiting equation\n(4.5) Durr + \u03c9\u2217u\u03c8 + fu(uwt(k\u2217r + \u03c8);\u03bc)u = \u039bu\nwith 2\u03c0-periodic boundary conditions in \u03c8. If we set \u03c8 \u0006\u2192 \u2212\u03c9\u2217t, we recover the Floquet\neigenvalue problem (2.13) of the 1D wave trains which we discussed in section 2.2. The\nFloquet symmetry of the Floquet eigenvalue problem (2.13) is re\ufb02ected in the invariance of\nthe asymptotic spiral eigenvalue problem (4.5) under the substitution\n(4.6) u(r, \u03c8) \u0006\u2212\u2192 u(r, \u03c8)ei\u0005\u03c8, \u039b \u0006\u2212\u2192 \u039b + i\u03c9\u2217\u0007\nfor each \u0007 \u2208 Z. We emphasize that the transformation (4.6) for the essential spectrum will\ngenerate new curves of spectrum for (4.4). The new eigenvalues are generated by the asymp-\ntotic SO(2)-symmetry of (4.4) and not by an arti\ufb01cial Floquet symmetry as for the wave\ntrains. Indeed, the spiral wave is an equilibrium, and each \u039b obtained from (4.6) belongs to\na di\ufb00erent eigenfunction.\nWe proved in [42] that these formal considerations can be made precise in the following\nsense. The operator L\u2217 \u2212 \u039b is Fredholm if and only if \u039b does not belong to the Floquet\nspectrum of the linearized period map of the asymptotic wave trains in the laboratory frame,\nthat is, if e2\u03c0\u039b\/\u03c9\u2217 is not in the spectrum of the period map of\nut = Duxx + fu(uwt(k\u2217x\u2212 \u03c9\u2217t);\u03bc)u.\n516 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nIn particular, the essential spectrum is vertically periodic in the complex plane with period\ni\u03c9\u2217. Moreover, for spirals emitting wave trains, which by de\ufb01nition have cg > 0 at \u03bd = 0,\nthe essential spectrum of the spiral wave in a neighborhood of the origin, and consequently\nall its vertical translates, moves into the left half-plane when L\u2217 is posed on the spaces with\nexponentially weighted norms\n|u|2L2\u03b7 =\n\u222b\nR2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223u(x, y)e\u2212\u03b7\u221ax2+y2\u2223\u2223\u22232 dxdy\nfor su\ufb03ciently small positive rates \u03b7 > 0. We may therefore de\ufb01ne the geometric and algebraic\nmultiplicities of \u039b = 0 and \u039b = \u00b1i\u03c9\u2217 as eigenvalues of L\u2217 posed on L2\u03b7 for small \u03b7 > 0. On\nthis space, \u2202\u03c8u\u2217 provides an eigenfunction of L\u2217 with \u039b = 0, while \u2202xu\u2217 and \u2202yu\u2217 generate\neigenfunctions belonging to \u039b = \u00b1i\u03c9\u2217. We proved in [42] that spiral waves are robust provided\nthese eigenvalues are algebraically simple as eigenvalues in L2\u03b7.\nThe preceding characterization of the essential spectrum of spiral waves by the spectrum\nof the asymptotic wave trains shows that essential spatio-temporal period-doubling of spiral\nwaves is a robust phenomenon.\nCorollary 4.1 (robust period-doubling of planar spirals). There exists an open class of one-\nparameter families of reaction-di\ufb00usion systems such that the essential spectrum of L\u2217 crosses\nthe imaginary axis \ufb01rst at \u039b = \u00b1i\u03c9\u2217\/2 + i\u03c9\u2217\u0007 for each \u0007 \u2208 Z.\nIn preparation for a discussion of the spectra of spirals under truncation to large bounded\ndisks, we record that the absolute spectrum of (4.4) coincides with the absolute spectrum\nof the asymptotic wave trains, computed in the laboratory frame, which is again vertically\nperiodic in the complex plane with period i\u03c9\u2217. In [42], we showed that for each \u039b \/\u2208 \u03a3abs there\nexists an exponential weight \u03b7 such that L\u2217\u2212\u039b is Fredholm with index zero on the space L2\u03b7.\nWe de\ufb01ne the extended point spectrum as the set of \u039b \/\u2208 \u03a3abs for which the kernel of L\u2217 \u2212 \u039b\nis nontrivial on L2\u03b7, with \u03b7 chosen as above. It is not di\ufb03cult to see that the kernel does not\ndepend on the choice of the weight [42].\nThe persistence of period-doubling on large bounded disks of radius R\t 1 with Neumann\nboundary conditions is now very similar in spirit to the situation in one space dimension.\nFirst, we address the persistence of the spiral wave on disks BR(0) for R \t 1. Similarly to\nTheorem 1, we assume the existence of a 1D boundary sink that connects the asymptotic wave\ntrains at x = \u2212\u221e with Neumann conditions at x = 0 such that \u039b = 0 does not belong to its\nextended point spectrum. Moreover, we assume robustness of the spiral on the plane; that is,\nwe require that \u039b = 0 is algebraically simple in L2\u03b7 for \u03b7 > 0 small. Under these conditions,\nthe spiral wave persists as a rigidly rotating solution of the reaction-di\ufb00usion system for all\nsu\ufb03ciently large R [42].\nNext, we consider the spectrum of the linearization (4.4) about the truncated spiral wave\non BR(0) with Neumann conditions at r = R, for which a result completely analogous to\nTheorem 3 holds.\nTheorem 7 (see [42]). Assume that the extended point spectrum of the spiral wave is dis-\ncrete; then the spectrum of the truncated 2D spiral converges locally uniformly in the symmet-\nric Hausdor\ufb00 distance to the disjoint union of the absolute spectrum \u03a3abs of the asymptotic\nwave trains, computed in the laboratory frame, and a discrete set of isolated eigenvalues with\n\ufb01nite multiplicity. Convergence to the absolute spectrum is algebraic of order O(1\/R), and\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 517\nthe number of eigenvalues inside any small disk that contains a point in the absolute spectrum\nconverges to in\ufb01nity as R\u2192\u221e. The discrete part of the limiting spectrum is the union of the\nextended point spectrum of the spiral and the extended point spectrum of the boundary sink on\nR\n\u2212. Convergence toward elements of the discrete part of the limiting spectrum is exponential\nin R, and the multiplicity of eigenvalues in a su\ufb03ciently small disk about an element of the\nextended point spectra converges to the sum of the multiplicities in the extended point spectra\nof planar spiral and boundary sink.\nRemark 4.2. We remark that it has recently been shown numerically [45] and analyti-\ncally [41] that in\ufb01nitely many discrete eigenvalues in the extended point spectrum of spiral\nwaves can accumulate at edges of the absolute spectrum.\nCorollary 4.3 (absolute period-doubling on bounded domains).

We \ufb01rst describe the shape of eigenfunctions for the essential spectrum (al-\nthough this is somewhat irrelevant to bifurcations taking place on large disks). Consider the\neigenvalue problem (2.8) of the wave train uwt in the 1D comoving frame and assume that it\nhas period-doubling eigenvalues given by\n\u03bb(\u03bd) = \u2212(cpdg \u2212 cp)(\u03bd \u2212 ik\u2217\/2) + d(\u03bd \u2212 ik\u2217\/2)2 +O(|\u03bd \u2212 ik\u2217\/2|3), cp =\n\u03c9\u2217\nk\u2217\n,\nfor \u03bd \u2248 ik\u2217\/2 with associated eigenfunctions given by\nv(y) = e\u03bdyupd(k\u2217y; \u03bd), upd(k\u2217y; \u03bd) = upd(k\u2217y + 2\u03c0; \u03bd) \u2200y\nwhen written in the variable y = \u03be\/k\u2217.

The pattern described by (4.10) looks exactly\nlike those observed experimentally in [28, 29, 47], numerically in [14], and here in Figure 1(ii).\nAlthough this computation is formal, the shape of eigenfunctions resulting from the abso-\nlute spectrum on large bounded domains can be computed similarly. Assume therefore that\n|cpdg | \u000f 1, as is the case, for instance, near spatially homogeneous oscillations. In this case, the\nabsolute spectrum has a branch point \u039bbp close to the tip of the period-doubling instability\nat \u039b = i\u03c9\u2217\/2 + \u03bc. This branch point corresponds to a root of the equation d\u039b\/d\u03bd = 0, with\n\u039b(\u03bd) as in (4.7), and is therefore given by\n\u039bbp =\ni\u03c9\u2217\n2\n\u2212 [c\npd\ng ]2\n4\n+ \u03bc with \u03bdbp =\ncpdg\n2d\n.\nFollowing the above computation gives\ncos(\u03d5\/2)e\u03bdbprvpd(k\u2217r + \u03d5\u2212 \u03c9\u2217t)\nfor the perturbation of the primary spiral-wave pro\ufb01le. In particular, we observe the stationary\nline of vanishing amplitude for the period-doubling mode, and in addition an exponential decay\nor growth of the eigenfunction depending on whether the group velocity of the period-doubling\nmode is negative or positive, respectively.\nAt the onset of the absolute instability on large disks, there are \ufb01ve eigenvalues in the\nvicinity of the imaginary axis, namely, \u039b = 0 induced by rotation, \u039b = \u00b1i\u03c9\u2217 + O(e\u2212\u03b4R)\ninduced by translation, and \u039bpd = \u00b1i\u03c9\u2217\/2 + O(1\/R2) near the branch point of the absolute\nspectrum that induces the period-doubling of the wave trains. In [43], we showed that resonant\nHopf bifurcations of this type will typically lead to a slow drift of the spiral wave with drift\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 519\nspeed O(\u03bc) (see also the discussion in section 1). Based on this prediction, we veri\ufb01ed that\ndrift indeed occurs in the Ro\u00a8ssler system and report on these computations in section 6.\nIndependently, drift was also observed numerically in [4].\nWe remark that the region of validity of our drift analysis is very small in parameter space\nsince the eigenvalue at the edge of the absolute spectrum is O(1\/R2)-close to other eigenvalues\nthat subsequently cross the imaginary axis.\nLast, we comment on the role played by the other eigenfunctions u\u0005(r, \u03c8) given in (4.8).\nProceeding as above, we see that the sum of the eigenfunctions u\u0005+1 and u\u2212\u0005 for positive\nintegers \u0007 generates patterns of the form\n(4.11) u\u2217(r, \u03d5\u2212 \u03c9\u2217t) +\n\u221a\n\u0012 cos\n(\n(2\u0007+ 1)\u03d5\n2\n)\nvpd(k\u2217r + \u03d5\u2212 \u03c9\u2217t),\nwhich exhibit 2\u0007+1 stationary line defects at \u03d5 = 2n+12\u0005+1 \u03c0 for n = 0, . . . , 2\u0007. Interestingly, none\nof the associated eigenvalues at \u039b = i\u03c9\u2217(\u0007+ 1\/2) a\ufb00ects the expected drift in any way as the\nresulting Hopf frequencies \u03c9H := (\u0007+ 1\/2)\u03c9\u2217 cannot satisfy the required resonance condition\n(1.2), except when \u0007 = 0, which is therefore solely responsible for the occurrence of drift.\n5. Defects near period-doubling of homogeneous oscillations. In this section, we study\npatterns that are created near the onset of period-doubling of a family of wave trains. We\nrestrict ourselves to the onset of period-doubling at homogeneous oscillations where k \u2248 0 and\ntherefore cg = c\npd\ng = 0.\n5.1. Derivation of amplitude equations.

Furthermore, we assume that \u03c1 = 1 and \u03c1 = \u22121 are geometrically\nand algebraically simple Floquet multipliers of the linearization\n\u03c90u\u03c4 = fu(u0(\u03c4); 0)u\nof (5.1) about u0(\u03c4); the associated nontrivial solutions of the linearization are given by u\n\u2032\n0(\u03c4)\nand upd(\u03c4), respectively. The associated solutions to the adjoint equation\n\u03c90w\u03c4 = \u2212fu(u0(\u03c4); 0)\u2217w\nwill be denoted by \u03c80(\u03c4) and \u03c8pd(\u03c4), respectively.\nSimplicity of \u03c1 = 1 implies that the periodic orbit u0(\u03c4) persists for all \u03bc close to zero\nwith temporal frequency \u03c9 = \u03c90(\u03bc), and we assume that the unique Floquet multiplier \u03c1pd(\u03bc)\nnear \u03c1 = \u22121 of the persisting wave train satis\ufb01es \u03c1\u2032pd(0) < 0. The simplicity of \u03c1 = 1 also\nimplies that the partial di\ufb00erential equation (PDE)\n(5.2) ut = Duxx + f(u;\u03bc)\nwith \u03bc = 0 has a one-parameter family of traveling waves u(x, t) = u0(\u03c9t \u2212 kx; k), de\ufb01ned\nfor |k| \u000f 1, near u0, where \u03c9 = \u03c9nl(k) with \u03c9nl(0) = \u03c90 is a smooth, even function of k [38,\n520 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nsection 3.3]. We assume that the nonlinear dispersion relation \u03c9nl(k) is nondegenerate so that\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032nl(0) \u0005= 0. Last, the linearization\nut = Duxx + fu(u0(\u03c90t); 0)u\nof (5.2) about u0(\u03c90t) can be reduced, via spatial Fourier transform, to the ODE\n(5.3) ut = [D\u03bd\n2 + fu(u0(\u03c90t); 0)]u.\nThe simplicity of the multipliers \u03c1 = \u00b11 implies that (5.3) has unique Floquet exponents,\ngiven by \u03bb0 = d0\u03bd\n2 +O(\u03bd4) and \u03bbpd = \u03c0i+d1\u03bd\n2 +O(\u03bd4) for appropriate constants d0, d1 \u2208 R,\nfor |\u03bd| \u000f 1, which correspond to \u03c1 = \u00b11. We assume that d0, d1 > 0.\nWe are interested in coherent structures near the homogeneous oscillations. Thus, for \u03c9\nclose to \u03c90, we introduce the new time variable \u03c4 = \u03c9t and seek solutions u(x, \u03c4) of the PDE\n(5.4) \u03c9u\u03c4 = Duxx + f(u;\u03bc)\nthat are 4\u03c0-periodic in \u03c4 .\nTheorem 8.

A similar complex version of (5.6) has been\nanalyzed in [9, 10, 11], where it was derived from a combustion model using formal multiscale\nexpansions to describe the interaction of Burgers and Hopf modes. We also refer the reader\nto [22] for the derivation of other amplitude equations for systems with conservation laws.\nBefore embarking on the proof of the preceding theorem, we consider spectral PDE sta-\nbility of the bounded solutions u\u2217(x, \u03c4) of (5.4) described by Theorem 8. A complex number\n\u03bb is a Floquet exponent of u\u2217(x, \u03c4) if and only if there exists a nontrivial 4\u03c0-periodic solution\nu(x, \u03c4) of\n(5.7) \u03bbu+ \u03c9u\u03c4 = Duxx + fu(u\u2217(x, \u03c4);\u03bc)u.\nFloquet exponents of u\u2217(x, \u03c4) near the origin are captured by the following result.\nTheorem 9. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 8, assume that U\u2217(x) = (\u03ba\u2217, A\u2217, B\u2217)(x) is a\nsmall bounded solution of (5.5) corresponding to a 4\u03c0-periodic solution u\u2217(x, \u03c4) of (5.4). If\nwe write (5.5) as (\nd0\u03c6xx\nd1Axx\n)\n= G(\u03c6x, A,Ax, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af),\nthen Floquet exponents \u03bb of (5.7) near the origin are in one-to-one correspondence, counting\nmultiplicity, with solutions \u03bb near the origin of the reduced PDE eigenvalue problem\n(\nd0\u03c6xx\nd1Axx\n)\n= D(\u03ba,A,B)G(\u03ba\u2217(x), A\u2217(x), B\u2217(x), \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af)\n\u239b\n\u239d \u03c6xA\nAx\n\u239e\n\u23a0+ \u03bb( 1 0\nb1A\u2217(x) 1\n)(\n\u03c6\nA\n)\n(5.8)\n+ \u03bb\n\u23a1\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3O(|\u03bb|+ |\u03bc|+ |\u03c9\u00af|)\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03c6\n\u03c6x\nA\nAx\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0+O(\u2016U\u2217\u2016)\n\u239b\n\u239d \u03c6xA\nAx\n\u239e\n\u23a0+ ( O(\u2016U\u2217\u2016)\nO(\u2016\u03ba\u2217\u20162 + \u2016A\u2217\u20162 + \u2016B\u2217\u2016)\n)\n\u03a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 .\nFurthermore, u\u2217(x, \u03c4) does not have any Floquet exponents in the right half-plane other than\nthose captured by (5.8) (or those obtained from the trivial Floquet symmetry).\nProof of Theorems 8 and 9. We proceed using spatial dynamics as in [6, section 8.1] and\ntherefore write (5.4) as\nux = v,(5.9)\nvx = D\n\u22121[\u03c9u\u03c4 \u2212 f(u;\u03bc)]\non the space X := H1per(0, 4\u03c0)\u00d7H1\/2per (0, 4\u03c0). Thus, we regard (5.9) as a dynamical system in\nthe spatial evolution variable x, acting on 4\u03c0-periodic functions u = (u, v) \u2208 X of the rescaled\ntemporal variable \u03c4 . Important features of (5.9) are its equivariance under the shifts\nS\u03c6 : X \u2212\u2192 X , u(\u00b7) \u0006\u2212\u2192 u(\u00b7 \u2212 \u03c6)\nfor each \ufb01xed \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 4\u03c0]\/\u223c and reversibility in x with reverser R : (u, v) \u0006\u2192 (u,\u2212v).\n522 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nEquation (5.9) has, for \u03bc = 0 and \u03c9 = \u03c90, an S\n1-group orbit of stationary solutions given\nby S\u03c6u0, where\nu0 :=\n(\nu0\n0\n)\n.\nEach of these solutions has isotropy Z2 generated by S2\u03c0. We \ufb01rst concentrate on a neighbor-\nhood of u0 and write u = u0 + v so that v \u2208 X satis\ufb01es\n(5.10) vx = B0v + (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90)N (u0 + v) + G(v;\u03bc)\nwith\nB0 =\n(\n0 1\nD\u22121[\u03c90\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 fu(u0(\u00b7); 0)] 0\n)\n, N =\n(\n0 0\nD\u22121\u2202\u03c4 0\n)\n,\nG(v;\u03bc) =\n(\n0\n\u2212D\u22121[f(u+ u0(\u00b7);\u03bc)\u2212 f(u0(\u00b7); 0)\u2212 fu(u0(\u00b7); 0)u]\n)\nfor v = (u, v). This is the system considered in [6, section 8.1]. Here, we have the additional\nsimpli\ufb01cation that both the wave number k0 and the group velocity cg vanish. As in [6,\nsection 8.1], the operator B0 is closed and densely de\ufb01ned on X and has only discrete spectrum.\nExploiting our hypotheses, we see that B0 has, in contrast to [6, section 8.1], two geometrically\nsimple eigenvalues at \u03bd = 0 with eigenfunctions (u\u20320, 0) and (upd, 0) (compared with a unique\ngeometrically simple eigenvalue in [6, section 8.1]). Each of these eigenvalues has algebraic\nmultiplicity two with generalized eigenfunctions given by (0, u\u20320) and (0, upd), respectively.\nThe associated eigenfunctions of the adjoint operator B\u22170 are given by\n(5.11) \u03c80 =\n(\n0\n\u2212D\u03c80\n)\n, \u03c81 =\n(\u2212D\u03c80\n0\n)\n, \u03c8pd0 =\n(\n0\nD\u03c8pd\n)\n, \u03c8pd1 =\n(\nD\u03c8pd\n0\n)\n,\nwhere \u03c80 and \u03c8pd have been de\ufb01ned at the beginning of section 5.1. The remaining spectrum\nof B0 on X is bounded away from the imaginary axis.\nUsing spatial center-manifold theory as in [6, section 8.1], we conclude that there exists a\nfour-dimensional center manifold associated with (5.9) which contains all solutions of (5.9) that\nstay near the S1-orbit {S\u03c6u0; \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 4\u03c0]\/\u223c} of equilibria for all x. The center manifold can\nbe constructed so that it is invariant under the shifts S\u03b8 and the reverser R. In particular, the\nvector \ufb01eld on the center manifold is reversible and equivariant under shifts. Upon inspecting\nthe operator B0 and exploiting the invariance under shifts in \u03c4 , we \ufb01nd that the center manifold\ncan be parametrized by the coordinates (\u03c6, \u03ba,A,B) via\n(5.12)\nu = S\u03c6\n[(\nu0(\u03bc)\n0\n)\n\u2212\u03ba\n(\n0\nu\u20320(\u03bc)\n)\n+A\n(\nupd(\u03bc)\n0\n)\n+B\n(\n0\nupd(\u03bc)\n)\n+ \u03c9\u00af\n(\nu\u03c9(\u03bc)\n0\n)\n+H0(\u03ba,A,B, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af)\n]\n,\nwhere u0(\u03bc) denotes the \u03bc-dependent spatially homogeneous oscillation, where upd(\u03bc) is the\n\u03bc-dependent eigenmode associated with u0(\u03bc) which causes period doubling at \u03bc = 0, and\nwhere we use the parameter \u03c9\u00af := \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90(\u03bc). The function u\u03c9 is the unique 2\u03c0-periodic\nsolution of the system\n(5.13) [\u03c90\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 fu(u0(\u03c4 ;\u03bc);\u03bc)]u\u03c9 = \u2212u\u20320 +\n\u3008\u03c80, u\u20320\u3009L2(0,2\u03c0)\n\u3008\u03c80, Du\u20320\u3009L2(0,2\u03c0)\nDu\u20320\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 523\nwith \u3008u\u03c9, u\u20320\u3009L2(0,2\u03c0) = 0. The function H0 is smooth and takes values in the generalized\nhyperbolic eigenspace Eh of B0, and its derivative with respect to each of its arguments\nvanishes at the origin (\u03ba,A,B, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af) = 0. Indeed, in these coordinates, the shifts S\u03b8 are\nrepresented by\nS\u03b8 : (\u03c6, \u03ba,A,B) \u0006\u2212\u2192 (\u03c6+ \u03b8, \u03ba,A,B),\nand equivariance implies that the reduced vector \ufb01eld, and the center-manifold parametriza-\ntion H0, can therefore not depend on \u03c6, as claimed. The isotropy group generated by S2\u03c0 and\nthe reverser R are represented by\nS2\u03c0 : (\u03c6, \u03ba,A,B) \u0006\u2212\u2192 (\u03c6, \u03ba,\u2212A,\u2212B), R : (\u03c6, \u03ba,A,B) \u0006\u2212\u2192 (\u03c6,\u2212\u03ba,A,\u2212B).\nIn particular, the reduced vector \ufb01eld will be equivariant under S2\u03c0 and reversible under R.\nWe shall now argue that the vector \ufb01eld for (\u03c6, \u03ba,A,B) is necessarily of the form\n\u03c6x = \u03ba+ g1(\u03ba,A,B, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af),\n\u03bax =\n1\nd0\n[\n\u2212\u03c9\u00af + 1\n2\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032nl(0)\u03ba\n2 + b0A\n2\n]\n+O(|A|3 + |\u03ba|3 +B2 + \u03c9\u00af2),(5.14)\nAx = B + g2(\u03ba,A,B, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af),\nBx =\n1\nd1\n[\n(\u2212\u03c1\u2032pd(0)\u03bc+ b1\u03c9\u00af + b2\u03ba2 + b3A2)A+ b4\u03baB\n]\n+O(|A|(A4 +A2|\u03ba|+ \u03bc2 + \u03c9\u00af2) + |B|\u03ba2 +B2(|\u03ba|+ |A|))\nfor appropriate constants bj \u2208 R, where the functions g1 and g2 are smooth and respect\nthe symmetries and the reverser, and their \ufb01rst two derivatives vanish at (\u03ba,A,B, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af) = 0.\nIndeed, the linear terms in (5.14) can be computed as in [6, section 8.1] by substituting (5.12)\ninto (5.10) and projecting using the adjoint eigenfunctions (5.11). In particular, the coe\ufb03cient\nb1 is given by\n(5.15) b1 =\n\u3008\u03c8pd, \u2202\u03c4upd \u2212 fuu(u0; 0)[u\u03c9, upd]\u3009L2(0,4\u03c0)\n\u3008\u03c8pd, upd\u3009L2(0,4\u03c0)\n.\nThe functions g1 and g2 must vanish to second order due to the facts that the diagonal of B0\nvanishes and the nonlinearity appears only in the v-component. Checking compatibility of the\nmonomial terms with the involution S2\u03c0 and the reverser R, we \ufb01nd that the equations for \u03ba\nand B must be of the speci\ufb01ed form. The special form of the equation for \u03ba when A = B = 0\nis a consequence of [6, section 8.1] and our choice of \u03c9\u00af as the o\ufb00set from the \u03bc-dependent\ntemporal frequency of spatially homogeneous oscillations. Last, to bring (5.14) into the form\n(5.5), we introduce the new coordinates\n\u03ba\u02dc = \u03ba+ g1(\u03ba,A,B, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af), B\u02dc = B + g2(\u03ba,A,B, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af).\nUpon dropping the tildes, we arrive at (5.5) as claimed, which completes the proof of Theo-\nrem 8.\nTo prove Theorem 9, we record that the solutions described by Theorem 8 are uniformly\nclose to the homogeneous oscillations u0(\u03c4) whose Floquet multipliers are contained strictly\n524 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\ninside the unit disk with the exception of multipliers close to \u03c1 = \u00b11. Floquet multipliers near\n\u03c1 = \u00b11 can be captured by a spatial center-manifold reduction for the eigenvalue problem\n(5.16) vx = [B0 + \u03c9\u00afN +DG(u;\u03bc)]v + \u03bb\n(\n0 0\nD\u22121\u2202\u03c4 0\n)\nv,\nwhich is carried out simultaneously with the reduction for the existence problem (5.10). Fol-\nlowing the same strategy as above, we \ufb01nd that the center manifold for the eigenvalue prob-\nlem (5.16) about a solution u from (5.12) corresponding to a solution (\u03ba\u2217, A\u2217, B\u2217) of (5.5) is\nparametrized by\nv =\n[\n\u2212\n(\nu\u20320\n0\n)\n\u2212 \u03ba\u2217\n(\n0\nu\u2032\u20320\n)\n+A\u2217\n(\nu\u2032pd\n0\n)\n+B\u2217\n(\n0\nu\u2032pd\n)\n+ \u2202\u03c4H0(\u03ba\u2217, A\u2217, B\u2217, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af)\n]\n\u03a6(5.17)\n\u2212 \u03ba\n(\n0\nu\u20320\n)\n+A\n(\nupd\n0\n)\n+B\n(\n0\nupd\n)\n+D(\u03ba,A,B)H0(\u03ba\u2217, A\u2217, B\u2217, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af)\n\u239b\n\u239d \u03baA\nB\n\u239e\n\u23a0\n+ \u03bb\n\u23a1\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n(\nu\u03c9(\u03bc)\n0\n)\n\u03a6+H10\n\u239b\n\u239d \u03baA\nB\n\u239e\n\u23a0+H11(\u03ba\u2217, A\u2217, B\u2217, \u03bc, \u03c9\u00af, \u03bb)\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03a6\n\u03ba\nA\nB\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u23a4\n\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 ,\nwhere H10 and H11 map into the hyperbolic eigenspace Eh of B0 and where H11(0) = 0.\nIn particular, for \u03bb = 0, we obtain precisely the linearization of the reduced vector \ufb01eld\nabout (\u03ba\u2217, A\u2217, B\u2217), and it remains to calculate the \u03bb-dependent terms. Using that H10 maps\ninto Eh and that (u\u03c9, 0) \u2208 Eh by construction (5.13), we obtain the desired expression (5.8)\nupon substituting (5.17) into (5.7) and projecting using the adjoint eigenfunctions (5.11).\nWe emphasize that the coe\ufb03cient in front of the \u03bbA\u2217\u03a6 term is equal to b1 as computed in\n(5.15).\nThe coe\ufb03cients appearing in (5.5), and, in particular, the coe\ufb03cient b1, are in general\nnonzero. It will often be more convenient to express the term \u03c9\u00afA in terms of \u03baxA. Thus, we\nwrite (5.5) as\n\u03c6x = \u03ba,\n\u03bax =\n1\nd0\n[\n\u2212\u03c9\u00af + 1\n2\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032nl(0)\u03ba\n2 + b0A\n2\n]\n+O(|A|3 + |\u03ba|3 +B2 + \u03c9\u00af2),\nAx = B,(5.18)\nBx =\n(\n\u2212\u03c1\n\u2032\npd(0)\nd1\n\u03bc+ b\u02dc1\u03bax + b\u02dc2\u03ba\n2 + b\u02dc3A\n2\n)\nA+ b\u02dc4\u03baB\n+O(|A|(A4 +A2|\u03ba|+ \u03bc2 + \u03c9\u00af2) + |B|\u03ba2 +B2(|\u03ba|+ |A|)),\nwhere\nb\u02dc1 := \u2212d0b1\nd1\n, b\u02dc2 :=\nb2 +\n1\n2\u03c9\n\u2032\u2032\nnl(0)b1\nd1\n, b\u02dc3 :=\nb3 + b0b1\nd1\n, b\u02dc4 :=\nb4\nd1\n.\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 525\nThe coe\ufb03cients appearing in (5.18) have the following interpretation: b0 describes how the\ntemporal frequency of period-doubled spatially homogeneous oscillations changes with the\namplitude of the period-doubling mode. The coe\ufb03cient b\u02dc2 encodes the wave number depen-\ndence of the onset of period-doubling, and b\u02dc3 re\ufb02ects whether the period-doubling bifurcation\nis subcritical or supercritical. Last, b\u02dc4 gives the dependence of the linear group velocity of\nthe period-doubling mode on the wave number of the underlying wave train. We shall assume\nthat the period-doubling bifurcation is supercritical and that the homogeneous oscillations\ndestabilize before the wave trains with nonzero wave number.\nHypothesis 1. We assume that b\u02dc2 > 0 and b\u02dc3 > 0.\nSince we already assumed that \u03c9\u2032\u2032nl(0) \u0005= 0, we can arrange to have \u03c9\u2032\u2032nl(0) > 0, possibly\nafter replacing \u03ba by \u2212\u03ba. Using this normalization together with b\u02dc3 > 0, an appropriate change\nof the parameters and the dependent and independent variables transforms (5.18) into\n\u03bax = \u2212\u03c9\u00af + \u03ba2 + bA2 +O(|A|3 + |\u03ba|3 +B2 + \u03c9\u00af2),\nAx = B,(5.19)\nBx = [\u2212\u03bc+ a\u03bax + d\u03ba2 +A2]A+ c\u03baB\n+O(|A|(A4 +A2|\u03ba|+ \u03bc2 + \u03c9\u00af2) + |B|\u03ba2 +B2(|\u03ba|+ |A|)),\nwhere we use the same letters for the new transformed variables and omit the equation for \u03c6\nas it decouples.

Using that any such solution U\u2217 is of order \u0012 as a solution to (5.19) due\nto the rescaling (5.20), it is not di\ufb03cult to see that any eigenvalue \u03bb of the reduced eigenvalue\nproblem (5.8) which lies near the origin and has Re\u03bb \u2265 0 is necessarily of order O(\u00122); see [6,\nproof of Lemma 8.2] for a similar argument.

Since we will not need the precise value of K0, we will not compute it.\n5.2. Wave trains. We \ufb01rst investigate equilibria of (5.22), which correspond to wave\ntrains of the original reaction-di\ufb00usion system (5.4). Equilibria (\u03ba,A,B) have B = 0 and\nsatisfy\n(5.25) \u03a9 = \u03ba2 + bA2, [\u2212\u03bc+ d\u03ba2 +A2]A = 0.\nEquilibria U0 = (\u03ba, 0, 0) with A = 0 exist for all wave numbers \u03ba with frequency o\ufb00set given\nby \u03a9 = \u03ba2. Thus, their group velocity is given by\nc0g =\nd\u03a9\nd\u03ba\n= 2\u03ba.\nThe linearization of (5.22) about these solutions is given by\nL0 =\n\u239b\n\u239d 2\u03ba 0 00 0 1\n0 \u2212\u03bc+ d\u03ba2 c\u03ba\n\u239e\n\u23a0 ,\nfrom which we see that they are hyperbolic except when \u03ba = 0 or \u03ba =\n\u221a\n\u03bc\/d. The bifurcation\nat \u03ba =\n\u221a\n\u03bc\/d is a pitchfork which corresponds to the period-doubling bifurcation which we\nanalyze next.\nThe equilibria bifurcating at \u03ba =\n\u221a\n\u03bc\/d can be found by solving (5.25) with A \u0005= 0. We\n\ufb01nd equilibria\nUpd =\n(\n\u03ba,\u00b1\n\u221a\n\u03bc\u2212 d\u03ba2, 0\n)\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 527\nFigure 3.

The open and closed circles denote eigenvalues coming from\nthe period-doubling amplitude A, while crosses denote eigenvalues coming from the phase \u03c6.

The group velocity of the period-doubled wave trains is therefore given by\ncpdg =\nd\u03a9\nd\u03ba\n= 2(1\u2212 bd)\u03ba.\nNear d\u03ba2 = \u03bc, the linearization Lpd of (5.22) about Upd has eigenvalues near 2\u03ba and c\u03ba in\naddition to the pitchfork eigenvalue given by\n\u03bdpd = \u2212c\npd\ng A2\n2c\u03ba2\n+O(A3) = \u2212(1\u2212 bd)A\n2\nc\u03ba\n+O(A3).\nThe spectrum of Lpd is illustrated in Figure 4. We remark that the spatial eigenvalue structure\nreveals in particular that the period-doubled wave trains must be PDE unstable near onset\nfor c > 0 and 1\u2212 bd < 0.\n5.3. Coherent structures. Our goal in this section is to shed some light on the nature of\nthe line defect that appears in Figure 1(ii). The line defect mediates between a period-doubled\nwave train and its 2\u03c0-translate. Thus, we shall discuss coherent structures that are spatially\nasymptotic as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e to the period-two wave train Upd and its 2\u03c0-translate \u2212Upd: These\n528 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nFigure 5. Figure (i) shows part of the reversible heteroclinic orbit Ud of (5.26) for b = 0 that connects\nthe equilibria U\u2212pd and U\n+\npd. Figures (ii) and (iii) contain the unfolding for b < 0 and b > 0, respectively, upon\nsetting \u03a9 := b\u03bc: The reversible heteroclinic orbit persists only for b > 0.\nstructures correspond to heteroclinic orbits between Upd and \u2212Upd of the spatial di\ufb00erential\nequation (5.23)\n\u03bax = \u2212\u03a9+ \u03ba2 + bA2,\nAx = B,(5.26)\nBx = [\u2212(\u03bc+ a\u03a9) + (a+ d)\u03ba2 + (1 + ab)A2]A+ c\u03baB.\nThere are various limiting cases in which a perturbation analysis is possible. We focus on the\nperturbation from b = 0 as it is the most illuminating case.\nWhen b = 0, (5.26) admits the semihyperbolic equilibria U\u00b1pd = (0,\u00b1\n\u221a\n\u03bc, 0) for \u03a9 = 0\nand \u03bc > 0 which correspond to spatially homogeneous period-doubled wave trains of the\nreaction-di\ufb00usion system (5.2). These equilibria are connected by the heteroclinic orbit\nUd(x) =\n(\n0,\n\u221a\n\u03bc tanh\n\u221a\n\u03bc\n2\nx,\n\u03bc\u221a\n2\nsech2\n\u221a\n\u03bc\n2\nx\n)\n;\nsee Figure 5(i). This orbit is reversible under the reverser RS2\u03c0 : (\u03ba,A,B) \u0006\u2192 (\u2212\u03ba,\u2212A,B).\nWe discuss now in what sense the reversible connection Ud persists upon varying b near zero,\nwhile \ufb01xing all other parameters including \u03bc. We focus on the persistence of reversible orbits\nwhich are obtained as intersections of unstable manifolds with the B-axis. The following\nanalysis is similar to the one given in [38, section 7].\nThe \ufb01rst case is 0 < b\u000f 1: We pick \u03a9 = b\u03bc so that (5.26) becomes\n\u03bax = \u03ba\n2 + b(A2 \u2212 \u03bc),\nAx = B,(5.27)\nBx = [\u2212\u03bc+ (a+ d)\u03ba2 +A2 + ab(A2 \u2212 \u03bc)]A+ c\u03baB.\nIn particular, the equilibrium U\u2212pd = (0,\u2212\n\u221a\n\u03bc, 0) persists as a semihyperbolic equilibrium for\nall b > 0. We wish to determine how the \u03ba-component of the strong unstable manifold at x = 0\ndepends on b upon varying b near zero. To this end, we record that the adjoint variational\nequation\nWx = \u2212\n\u239b\n\u239d 0 0 00 0 1\ncBd(x) [\u2212\u03bc+ 3A2d(x)]A 0\n\u239e\n\u23a0\n\u2217\nW\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 529\nassociated with the linearization of (5.27) about Ud at b = 0 has the solution W (x) = (1, 0, 0).\nThe Melnikov integral associated with the derivative of the right-hand side of (5.27) with\nrespect to b is therefore given by\n(5.28) M :=\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2329\nW (x), (A2d(x)\u2212 \u03bc)\n\u239b\n\u239d 10\na\n\u239e\n\u23a0\u232adx = \u222b 0\n\u2212\u221e\n[A2d(x)\u2212 \u03bc] dx = \u2212\n\u221a\n2\u03bc < 0.\nThus, the unfolding of the heteroclinic orbit near b = 0 is as shown in Figure 5, and we conclude\nthat the reversible heteroclinic orbit between the semihyperbolic equilibria U\u00b1pd persists only\nfor b > 0, but not for b < 0. The resulting coherent structure of the reaction-di\ufb00usion system\nis a contact defect in the classi\ufb01cation of [38] as it mediates between two wave trains with\nzero group velocity.\nThe remaining case is \u22121 \u000f b < 0: We set \u03a9 = b\u03bc + (1 \u2212 bd)\u03b72 and treat \u03b7 as an\nindependent parameter with \u03b7 \u2248 0 so that (5.26) becomes\n\u03bax = \u2212(1\u2212 bd)\u03b72 + \u03ba2 + b(A2 \u2212 \u03bc),\nAx = B,(5.29)\nBx = [\u2212\u03bc\u2212 a(1\u2212 bd)\u03b72 + (a+ d)\u03ba2 +A2 + ab(A2 \u2212 \u03bc)]A+ c\u03baB.\nThe parameter \u03b7 unfolds the saddle-node bifurcation occurring at b = 0, leading therefore to\nthe equilibria\nU\u00b1pd(\u03b7) = (\u03b7,\u00b1\n\u221a\n\u03bc\u2212 d\u03b72, 0)\nnear U\u00b1pd. On account of the results in section 5.2, we know that the equilibria U\n\u00b1\npd(\u03b7) have\npositive group velocity for \u03b7 > 0 and negative group velocity for \u03b7 < 0. We focus on \ufb01nding\nreversible heteroclinic orbits that connect the hyperbolic equilibrium U\u2212pd(\u2212\u03b7) at x = \u2212\u221e\nto the hyperbolic equilibrium U+pd(\u03b7) at x = \u221e for \u03b7 > 0. The resulting coherent structure\nof the reaction-di\ufb00usion system is a source in the classi\ufb01cation of [38] as it connects a wave\ntrain with negative group velocity at x = \u2212\u221e to a wave train with positive group velocity at\nx =\u221e. To \ufb01nd sources, we note that the behavior of the \u03ba-component of the strong unstable\nmanifold under changes of b at x = 0 is, for \u03b7 = 0, again determined by the Melnikov integral\nM < 0 in (5.28). Thus, as far as sources are concerned, the unfolding of the heteroclinic orbit\nnear b = 0 is as shown in Figure 6. We conclude that, for each b < 0 close to zero, there is a\nunique \u03b7 > 0 with a reversible heteroclinic orbit connecting U\u2212pd(\u2212\u03b7) at x = \u2212\u221e to U+pd(\u03b7),\nwhile no such connection exists for b > 0.\nTheorem 10. For 0 < b\u000f 1, the amplitude equation (5.26) has contact defects that connect\nthe period-doubled spatially homogeneous wave train Upd at x = \u2212\u221e and its 2\u03c0-time translate\nat x = \u221e. For \u22121 \u000f b < 0, (5.26) admits sources that connect period-doubled wave trains\nUpd(x) with negative group velocity at x = \u2212\u221e to the re\ufb02ected wave trains Upd(\u2212x) with\npositive group velocity at x =\u221e. For a, b, c, and d su\ufb03ciently close to zero, both defects are\nspectrally stable.\nProof. The existence part has already been proved, and we therefore focus on spectral\nstability.\n530 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nFigure 6. Figure (i) shows part of the reversible heteroclinic orbit Ud of (5.26) for b = 0 that connects\nthe equilibria U\u2212pd and U\n+\npd. Figures (ii) and (iii) contain the unfolding for b < 0 and b > 0, respectively, upon\nsetting \u03a9 = b\u03bc+ (1\u2212 bd)\u03b72 with \u03b7 \u0002= 0: The reversible source persists for b < 0.\nWe consider sources \ufb01rst and set a = c = d = 0, b = \u2212\u03b4, and \u03a9 = b + \u03b72 = \u2212\u03b4 + \u03b72 for\n\u03b4 > 0 small. We also rescale the A-equation so that \u03bc = 1. Thus, (5.29) becomes\n\u03bax = \u2212\u03b72 + \u03ba2 + \u03b4(1\u2212A2),\nAx = B,\nBx = [A\n2 \u2212 1]A\nso that A\u2217(x) = tanh(x\/\n\u221a\n2) independently of \u03b7 and \u03b4. The source Ud = (\u03ba\u2217, A\u2217, \u2202xA\u2217) decays\nexponentially to zero as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e with a rate independent of \u03b4 \u2265 0 since it lies by construction\nin the strong unstable and stable manifolds of the asymptotic semihyperbolic equilibria. The\nreduced PDE eigenvalue problem (5.24) about Ud is given by\n(5.30) \u039b\n(\n\u03c6\nA\n)\n=\n(\nd0[\u2202xx \u2212 2\u03ba\u2217\u2202x] 2\u03b4A\u2217\n0 d1[\u2202xx + 1\u2212A2\u2217]\n)(\n\u03c6\nA\n)\n.\nSince the constant functions are admissible eigenfunctions for sources according to the counting\narguments presented in [38], we see that \u039b = 0 is an eigenvalue with geometric multiplicity\ntwo. This is in line with [38, Lemma 4.4], which asserts that sources must have two eigenvalues\nat the origin. It remains to show that the algebraic multiplicity of \u039b = 0 is two and that there\nare no other eigenvalues in the closed right half-plane. To prove this claim, we set \u03b4 = 0 to\nget\n(5.31) \u039b\n(\n\u03c6\nA\n)\n=\n(\nd0\u2202xx 0\n0 d1[\u2202xx + 1\u2212A2\u2217]\n)(\n\u03c6\nA\n)\n=:\n( L0 0\n0 L1\n)(\n\u03c6\nA\n)\n.\nSturm\u2013Liouville theory implies that L1 has a simple eigenvalue \u039b = 0 and no other spectrum\nin the closed right half-plane. Similarly, L0 has the eigenvalue \u039b = 0 with eigenfunction\n\u03c6(x) = 1 and no other spectrum in the closed right half-plane. Since the perturbation leading\nfrom (5.31) to (5.30) is small and decays with uniform exponential rate in x, we can apply\nstandard Evans-function theory [18] to conclude that (5.30) with 0 < \u03b4 \u000f 1 has precisely two\neigenvalues near the origin, counting multiplicity, which are therefore given by the eigenvalues\nat \u039b = 0 mentioned above. The same argument applies when perturbing from (a, c, d) = 0,\nwhich completes the proof for sources.\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 531\nIt remains to consider the contact defects. We set a = c = d = 0, b = \u03b4, and \u03a9 = b = \u03b4\nfor \u03b4 > 0 small and again rescale the A-equation so that \u03bc = 1. The existence problem (5.29)\nbecomes\n\u03bax = \u03ba\n2 \u2212 \u03b4(1\u2212A2),\nAx = B,\nBx = [A\n2 \u2212 1]A\nso that A\u2217(x) = tanh(x\/\n\u221a\n2) independently of \u03b4, and we get\n\u03bax = \u03ba\n2 \u2212 \u03b4 sech2\n(\nx\u221a\n2\n)\n.\nWe record for later use that the reversible contact-defect solution \u03ba\u2217(x) then satis\ufb01es\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2\u03b4 \u2264 \u03ba\u2217(x) \u2264 0, x \u2265 0,\nwith \u03ba\u2217(0) = 0 and \u03ba\u2217(x) = K1\/x2 +O(1\/x3) as x\u2192\u221e for some K1 \u2264 0. The reduced PDE\neigenvalue problem (5.24) about the contact defect is again given by\n(5.32) \u039b\n(\n\u03c6\nA\n)\n=\n(\nd0[\u2202xx \u2212 2\u03ba\u2217\u2202x] 2\u03b4A\u2217\n0 d1[\u2202xx + 1\u2212A2\u2217]\n)(\n\u03c6\nA\n)\n.\nAs shown in [39, Theorem 3], contact defects have generically a single simple eigenvalue at\nthe origin. Furthermore, it is a consequence of the results in [39] that the only admissible\neigenfunctions of (5.32) are those that decay algebraically as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. We will therefore\nfocus on the decoupled eigenvalue problem\n(5.33) \u03c6xx \u2212 2\u03ba\u2217(x)\u03c6x = \u039b\u03c6\nd0\nfor \u03c6 and prove that it has no spectrum in the closed right half-plane for \u03b4 > 0. Eigenfunctions\nbelonging to nonzero eigenvalues \u039b of (5.33) in the closed right half-plane decay necessarily\nexponentially with nonzero rate\n\u221a\n\u039b and, using the algebraic convergence \u03ba\u2217(x) = K1\/x2 +\nO(1\/x3) of the contact defect as x\u2192 \u00b1\u221e, we may therefore set\n\u03a6(x) := exp\n(\u222b x\n\u221e\n\u03ba\u2217(y) dy\n)\n\u03c6(x),\nwhich transforms the eigenvalue problem for \u03c6 into the equivalent eigenvalue problem\n\u03a6xx \u2212 \u03b4 sech2\n(\nx\u221a\n2\n)\n\u03a6 =\n\u039b\u03a6\nd0\nfor \u03a6. For \u03b4 > 0, there are no eigenvalues in the closed right half-plane, with the possible\nexception of the origin. We focus therefore on the eigenvalue problem (5.33) with \u039b = 0,\nwhich is given by\n(5.34) \u03c6xx \u2212 2\u03ba\u2217(x)\u03c6x = 0.\n532 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nFigure 7. The boundary sink U\u2217 which accommodates Neumann boundary conditions and the period-one\nwave train with nonzero wave number\n\u221a\n\u03a9 is shown for \u03a9 > 1\/d.\nFor \u03b4 > 0, the unique solution which decays algebraically as x\u2192\u221e is given by\n\u03c6(x) =\n\u222b x\n\u221e\nexp\n(\u222b y\n\u221e\n2\u03ba\u2217(z) dz\n)\ndy.\nThis solution is an eigenfunction provided it is odd as \u03c6(x) = 1 is the unique even solution of\n(5.34). Thus, we need \u03c6x(0) = 0 but have\n\u03c6x(0) = exp\n(\u222b 0\n\u221e\n2\u03ba\u2217(z) dz\n)\n\u0005= 0,\nwhich proves that \u039b = 0 is not an eigenvalue of (5.33). Last, the perturbation from (a, c, d) = 0\ncan be dealt with by regular perturbation theory using the Evans-function construction\nin [39].\n5.4. Boundary sinks. Last, we investigate the existence and stability of boundary sinks\nfor Neumann boundary conditions. In other words, we seek solutions U(x) of\n\u03bax = \u2212\u03a9+ \u03ba2 + bA2,\nAx = B,(5.35)\nBx = [\u2212(\u03bc+ a\u03a9) + (a+ d)\u03ba2 + (1 + ab)A2]A+ c\u03baB\nfor x \u2264 0 so that U(0) lies on the A-axis, corresponding to Neumann boundary conditions,\nand U(x) converges to an equilibrium U\u2212 of (5.35) with positive group velocity as x\u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nWe focus on the equilibria U0 = (\u03ba,A, b) = (\n\u221a\n\u03a9, 0, 0) which correspond to the period-one\nwave trains with nonzero wave number\n\u221a\n\u03a9 and group velocity c0g = 2\u03ba = 2\n\u221a\n\u03a9 > 0. In this\ncase, the boundary sink is given explicitly by\nU\u2217(x) = (\u03ba,A,B)(x) =\n(\n\u2212\n\u221a\n\u03a9 tanh(\n\u221a\n\u03a9x), 0, 0\n)\n, x \u2264 0;\nsee Figure 7. The PDE stability of the boundary sink U\u2217 can be analyzed as follows. Evaluat-\ning (5.24) at \u0012 = 0, we \ufb01nd that the reduced eigenvalue problem associated with the boundary\nsink U\u2217 = (\u03ba\u2217(x), 0, 0) is given by\n\u03c6xx \u2212 2\u03ba\u2217(x)\u03c6x = \u039b\nd0\n\u03c6,\nAxx \u2212 c\u03ba\u2217(x)Ax + [\u03bc+ a\u03a9\u2212 (a+ d)\u03ba2\u2217(x)]A =\n\u039b\nd1\nA\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 533\non R\u2212 together with Neumann boundary conditions \u03c6x(0) = Ax(0) = 0. The equation for \u03c6\ndecouples and coincides with the eigenvalue problem of Lax shocks of the Burgers equation;\nin particular, there are no point eigenvalues in the closed right half-plane, and the essential\nspectrum consists of the curve \u039b\/d0 = \u2212k2\u22122\n\u221a\n\u03a9ik for k \u2208 R; see, for instance, [6, Lemma 8.2].\nIt remains to analyze the equation for A given by\nAxx + c\n\u221a\n\u03a9 tanh(\n\u221a\n\u03a9x)Ax +\n[\n\u03bc\u2212 d\u03a9\u2212 (a+ d)\u03a9 sech2(\n\u221a\n\u03a9x)\n]\nA =\n\u039b\nd1\nA, x < 0,(5.36)\nAx(0) = 0.\nThe essential spectrum of (5.36) is given by\n(5.37)\n\u039bess(k)\nd1\n= \u03bc\u2212 \u03a9d\u2212 k2 \u2212 c\n\u221a\n\u03a9ik,\nand we denote by\n\u039bbp\nd1\n= \u03bc\u2212 \u03a9\n(\nd+\nc2\n4\n)\nthe branch point of the linear dispersion relation \u039bess. The point spectrum of (5.36) can also\nbe calculated explicitly: Using the independent variable z = tanh(\n\u221a\n\u03a9x), real-valued solutions\nto (5.37) are given in terms of Ferrers functions which are appropriate linear combinations\nof the associated Legendre functions [25, section 5]. Using the results in [25, sections 5.12\nand 5.15], we \ufb01nd that the point spectrum of (5.36) consists precisely of the points \u039bn given\nby\n\u039bn\nd1\n= \u03bc\u2212 \u03a9d+ \u03a9\n4\n([\u221a\n(c\u2212 1)2 + 4(a+ d)\u2212 1\u2212 4n\n]2 \u2212 c2)\nfor those integers n \u2265 0 for which\n(5.38)\n\u221a\n(c\u2212 1)2 + 4(a+ d) \u2265 1 + 4n.\nIn particular, the rightmost point eigenvalue \u039b0 is given by\n(5.39)\n\u039b0\nd1\n= \u03bc\u2212 \u03a9d+ \u03a9\n4\n([\u221a\n(c\u2212 1)2 + 4(a+ d)\u2212 1\n]2 \u2212 c2) ,\nassuming that the term in the square brackets is positive.\nWe shall assume from now on that the group velocity c of the period-doubling mode is\nnegative so that c < 0. The period-one wave train U\u2212 undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation at\n\u03bc = \u03a9d which, as outlined in section 5.2, leads to the period-two wave train Upd which has a\nnonzero A-component. We discuss now how this bifurcation, which occurs when the essential\nspectrum \u039bess crosses the imaginary axis, interacts with the bifurcation of boundary sinks,\nwhich occurs when the eigenvalue \u039b0 destabilizes. There are three relevant cases:\n(1) \u039b0 does not exist; that is, (5.38) is not met for n = 0.\n(2) \u039bbp < \u039b0 < \u039bess.\n(3) \u039bess < \u039b0.\n534 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nFigure 8. We illustrate case (2) (c < 0 and \u039bbp < \u039b0 < \u039bess) for increasing \u03bc under the assumption that\nthe bifurcation associated with \u039b0 is supercritical. The \ufb01rst instability occurs when \u039bess = 0, leading in (ii)\nto a stable period-two wave train Upd which does not persist under Neumann boundary conditions as there is\nno boundary sink available. When \u039b0 destabilizes, the stable boundary sink U\u2217\u2217 bifurcates from U\u2217, and the\nperiod-two wave train Upd persists now under Neumann boundary conditions due to the presence of U\u2217\u2217.\nFigure 9. Case (3) (c < 0 and \u039bess < \u039b0) is illustrated for increasing \u03bc: The boundary sink U\u2217 destabilizes\nin (ii) when the eigenvalue \u039b0 crosses the imaginary axis. This leads in (iii) to the existence of a stable period-\ndoubled boundary sink U\u2217\u2217. The essential instability which occurs when \u039bess = 0 leads then in (iv) to a stable\nperiod-two wave train Upd which persists under Neumann boundary conditions due to the presence of U\u2217\u2217.\nUsing c \u2264 0, we see that the last case occurs for a+ d > 0, while the eigenvalue \u039b0 disappears\nin the branch point \u039bbp when the term in the square brackets in (5.39) becomes zero. Since\ncase (1) has already been discussed in section 3.4, and case (2) is similar to (3), we concentrate\nin the following on (3) and refer the reader to Figure 9 for an illustration of case (2).\nThus, assume that c < 0 and \u039bess < \u039b0: Upon increasing \u03bc, the boundary sink U\u2217\ndestabilizes when \u039b0 = 0. In terms of the spatial ODE (5.35), this bifurcation manifests itself\nas a tangency of the unstable manifold of the equilibrium U\u2212 as indicated in Figure 9(ii).\nWe show in Lemma 5.1 below that this bifurcation can be supercritical, thus leading to a\nstable boundary sink U\u2217\u2217 which connects U\u2212 to the A-axis as illustrated in Figure 9(iii).\nSince the A-component of U\u2217\u2217 is not zero, the boundary sink U\u2217\u2217 will have period two, even\nthough the period-two wave train Upd has not yet bifurcated from U\u2212. A further increase\nof \u03bc then leads to the period-two wave trains Upd which persist under Neumann conditions\nthanks to the boundary sink U\u2217\u2217 as indicated in Figure 9(iv). The characteristic feature of\nscenario (3) is therefore that the period-doubling sets in \ufb01rst at the boundary, where it is\nalso most pronounced during the entire bifurcation sequence. It remains to prove that the\npitchfork bifurcation of the boundary sink is supercritical.\nLemma 5.1. Assume that b \u2264 0, c < 0, a + d > 0, and 1 + ab \u2265 0; then the pitchfork\nbifurcation of the boundary sink U\u2217, which occurs when \u039b0 = 0, is supercritical.\nProof. We need to prove that the part of the unstable manifold of U\u2212 which lies in A > 0\nhas B \u2265 0. Using the projective coordinate w = B\/A, we arrive at the system\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 535\nFigure 10. Proof of Lemma 5.1: If the tangent space angle w(x) decreases monotonically, then the unstable\nmanifold lies above the tangent space for b < 0 and 1 + ab > 0.\nux = \u2212\u03a9+ u2 + bA2,\nAx = Aw,\nwx = \u2212(\u03bc+ a\u03a9) + (a+ d)u2 + (1 + ab)A2 \u2212 cuw \u2212 w2.\nIf the solution that corresponds to the tangent space of the unstable manifold of U\u2212 evaluated\nalong the boundary sink U\u2217 decreases monotonically for x \u2208 R\u2212, then the bifurcation will\nindeed be supercritical for b < 0 and 1 + ab > 0 as outlined in Figure 10 since the nonlinear\nterms involving A point in the right direction. The tangent space of the unstable manifold of\nU\u2212 evaluated along the boundary sink U\u2217 satis\ufb01es the linearized equation\nwx = \u2212(\u03bc+ a\u03a9) + (a+ d)u2\u2217(x)\u2212 cu\u2217(x)w \u2212 w2.\nWe claim that wx < 0 for all x for the solution that converges as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e to the tangent\nspace of the unstable manifold of U\u2217. First, for u near\n\u221a\n\u03a9, we write u =\n\u221a\n\u03a9 \u2212 h and\nw(x) = w\u2217 +W (x), where w\u2217 is the unique positive solution of\n(5.40) \u2212(\u03bc+ a\u03a9) + (a+ d)\u03a9\u2212 c\n\u221a\n\u03a9w\u2217 \u2212 w2\u2217 = 0,\nwhich corresponds to the unstable eigenvector of the linearization of (5.35) about U\u2212. The\nresulting system for W is\nWx = (c\n\u221a\n\u03a9\u2212 2w\u2217)W \u2212 h\u221a\n\u03a9\n[2\u03a9(a+ d) + c\n\u221a\n\u03a9w\u2217] + O(h2 +W 2).\nSubstituting (5.40), we get\nWx = (c\n\u221a\n\u03a9\u2212 2w\u2217)W \u2212 h\u221a\n\u03a9\n[\u03a9(a+ d) + \u03bc+ a\u03a9+ w2\u2217] + O(h\n2 +W 2),\nwhich means that Wx < 0 for h > 0 since the term in the square brackets turns out to be\npositive when \u039b0 = 0. A similar argument shows that the solution w(x) satis\ufb01es wxx(x) < 0,\nwhenever wx(x) = 0, which completes the proof.\n536 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nC=3.4\nC=2.8\nt\nw\nFigure 11.

Note that their phase velocity cp = \u03c9\/k and their group velocity cg = d\u03c9\/dk have\nopposite signs: Since the 2D spiral waves select the wave trains with positive group velocity,\nthe wave trains in the far \ufb01eld of the 2D spirals travel toward the core rather than toward the\nboundary.\nNext, we plot in Figure 13 the curves where the essential and absolute spectra of the\n1D wave trains with frequency \u03c9 cross the imaginary axis. These instabilities are caused\n538 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nFigure 14. Absolute and essential period-doubling spectra of the spiral waves are shown (left). The right\nplot shows the linear period-doubling dispersion relation with Im\u03bbpd plotted against the associated wave number\ny: The linear group velocity cpdg is therefore negative.\nby period-doubling modes with negative linear group velocity cpdg < 0; see Figure 14. Direct\nnumerical simulations of (6.1) allow us to determine the temporal frequencies selected by spiral\nwaves for di\ufb00erent values of C, which are also shown in Figure 13. The associated spatial\nwave number of the wave trains in the far \ufb01eld is k \u2248 0.2, which is close to zero in line with\nthe observation that the period-doubling bifurcations are organized by spatially homogeneous\noscillations.\nThe closeness to spatially homogeneous oscillations allows us to investigate the nature of\nthe line defect that is visible in Figure 11 by applying the results of section 5.3 about coherent\nstructures: Figure 12 shows that the coe\ufb03cient b arising in (5.26) is negative, and Theorem 10\nthen implies that the line defect in Figure 11 is a source, rather than a contact defect. The\nanalysis in section 5.3 predicts a tanh(x) pro\ufb01le of the period-doubling mode across the line\ndefect which has indeed been measured in [14, equation (2) and Figure 3] based on numerical\nsimulations of (6.1). We refer the reader to [48] for an analysis of line defects based on\ninterpreting spirals as a \ufb01eld of coupled oscillators.\nTo determine when and how the spiral waves destabilize upon increasing C, we \ufb01x points\n(x0, y0) in the domain and record the time series w\u2217(x0, y0, t) of the spiral wave. We then\ncompute the di\ufb00erence between consecutive maxima of the time series which we use as a\nmeasure for the period-doubling amplitude. This computation is done for \ufb01ve points (xj , yj)\nwhich are spaced equidistantly on a ray that connects the spiral core to the boundary and\navoids the line defect. Since our theoretical results predict that period-doubled spirals ought\nto drift, we also computed the spiral tip and its drift velocity. The results are shown in\nFigure 13. The indications are therefore that period-doubling of spirals sets in at C \u2248 2.96.\nThe instability appears to be most visible at the boundary, with a square-root type behavior\nreminiscent of pitchfork and Hopf bifurcations, and less pronounced toward the core. The\nspiral does begin to drift, but the drift velocity is very small, and we could not identify a\nclearly de\ufb01ned transition point to drift.\nWe now discuss the di\ufb00erent possible mechanisms outlined in section 4 that may be re-\nsponsible for the observed period-doubling in the Ro\u00a8ssler system. First, we plot in Figure 14\nrepresentative absolute and essential spectra of the asymptotic 1D wave trains. Lemma 2.3\nasserts that the absolute spectrum arising due to period-doubling bifurcations of wave trains\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 539\nnear spatially homogeneous oscillations has to lie on the symmetry line Im\u03bb = \u03c9\/2, and this\nis indeed what happens here for the spatial wave numbers k \u2248 0.2 selected by the spirals.\nFigure 14 also shows that the linear group velocity cpdg of the period-doubling modes is neg-\native. However, both absolute and essential spectra are still in the left half-plane when the\nperiod-doubling sets in at C = 2.96. Furthermore, due to cpdg < 0, the absolute eigenmodes\ndecay toward the boundary, which appears to contradict Figure 13 which seems to imply that\nperiod-doubling is more pronounced at the boundary. Thus, the bifurcation does not seem to\nbe caused directly by the absolute spectrum.\nThe second possibility is that the instability is caused by point eigenvalues that emanate\nfrom the branch point located at the edge of the absolute spectrum due to curvature e\ufb00ects\nof the Laplacian; see Remark 4.2. We have evaluated numerically the criterion derived in [41,\nsection IV] using the algorithm described there and found that, in the notation of [41], \u03a6 = \u03c0,\nwhich means that no point eigenvalues arise near the branch point.\nThis leaves the last option, namely, that period-doubling is caused by point eigenvalues\nof the boundary sink. We have discussed this case in section 5.4 for boundary sinks in the\nnear-spatially homogeneous case and shown that these sinks can indeed possess isolated point\neigenvalues that are in resonance with i\u03c9\/2. In particular, the scenario described in Figure 9\nis consistent with the numerical observations reported in Figure 13 and therefore provides the\nlikeliest explanation for the occurrence of period-doubling in the Ro\u00a8ssler system: As seen from\nFigure 9(iii), the period-doubling amplitude is most visible at the boundary, while decreasing\ntoward the core. Since the adjoint eigenfunction associated with the translational eigenmodes\nof the spiral wave decreases exponentially toward the boundary, we expect that the drift\ncoe\ufb03cient is exponentially small in the domain diameter which may explain the slow drift\nobserved in Figure 13.\nTo further corroborate this conclusion, we exploit that the wave trains selected by the\nspiral waves have wave numbers near zero and are therefore close to spatially homogeneous\noscillations. Thus, if we can determine the coe\ufb03cients appearing in the reduced eigenvalue\nproblem (5.36) of the boundary sinks, then we can calculate the approximate location of\nthe rightmost eigenvalue \u039b0 given in (5.39) and the expected onset of period-doubling. The\nunscaled version (5.5) of the amplitude equations is given by\nd0\u03bax = \u2212\u03c9\u00af + 1\n2\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032nl(0)\u03ba\n2 + b0A\n2,(6.5)\nd1Axx = [\u2212\u03bc+ b\u02c61\u03bax + b\u02c62\u03ba2 + b\u02c63A2]A+ b4\u03baAx.\nWe remark that the coe\ufb03cients b0 and b\u02c63 do not enter into the calculations presented in\nsection 5.4, but Figure 12 indicates that b\u02c63 is positive as required. The coe\ufb03cient b0 is\nrelevant for the line defect of the period-doubled spiral and has already been discussed above.\nThe parameter \u03bc will be replaced later by an appropriate expression in C.\nFirst, we note that d0 = d1 = 0.4 are equal to the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient in (6.1) since the\ndi\ufb00usion matrix is a multiple of the identity. The \ufb01t to the nonlinear dispersion relation\npresented in Figure 12 gives 12\u03c9\n\u2032\u2032\nnl(0) = 0.530. The coe\ufb03cient b\u02c61 can be computed numerically\nby evaluating (5.15): Since the di\ufb00usion matrix in (6.1) is a multiple of the identity, it follows\nfrom (5.13) that u\u03c9 = 0. After calculating the adjoint solution \u03c8pd of the linearization of (6.3)\n540 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nFigure 15. In the left \ufb01gure, we plot the period-doubling Floquet exponent \u03bbpd of the spatially homogeneous\nwave trains of (6.3) as a function of the parameter C. The right \ufb01gure shows the period-doubling bifurcation\ncurve of wave trains to (6.4) with wave number k together with various curve \ufb01ts.\nabout the homogeneous oscillation, we obtain b\u02c61 = 0.925. The coe\ufb03cient b4 is equal to the\nslope of the linear group velocity of the period-doubling mode, considered as a function of the\nwave number k of the underlying wave train: our computation of this slope gives b4 = \u22120.74;\nsee [31] for the relevant algorithms. Next, we need to express the bifurcation parameter \u03bc in\n(6.5) by an appropriate expression in C: To this end, we calculated in Figure 15 the period-\ndoubling Floquet exponent of the homogeneous oscillations as a function of C. A least-square\n\ufb01t gives \u03bbpd = 0.108(C \u2212 2.834), and therefore \u03bc = 0.108(C \u2212 2.834) since \u03bc in (6.5) and \u03bbpd\nin the reduced eigenvalue problem appear with the same coe\ufb03cient. Summarizing the results\nobtained so far, we arrive at the equation\n0.4\u03bax = \u2212\u03c9\u00af + 0.530\u03ba2,(6.6)\n0.4Axx = [\u22120.108(C \u2212 2.834) + 0.925\u03bax + b\u02c62\u03ba2]A\u2212 0.74\u03baAx.\nIt remains to determine the coe\ufb03cient b\u02c62, which measures the dependence of the onset of\nperiod-doubling on the wave number k of the underlying wave train of (6.4). This relation,\ntogether with various curve \ufb01ts, is plotted in Figure 15. We recall that the spirals select wave\nnumbers of around k = 0.203. In this region, however, there is unfortunately no accurate \ufb01t\nof the required form C \u2212 0.2834 = b\u02c62k2. Thus, we do not seem to be in the region where the\napproximation by (6.5) is valid. We therefore proceed as follows: First, we may take b\u02c62 = 9.06,\nwhich corresponds to a quadratic \ufb01t in the interval k \u2208 (0.15, 0.25). Alternatively, we replace\nthe b\u02c62\u03ba\n2 term in (6.6) by 88.8\u03ba4 +3.91\u03ba2 +2.83, which is an excellent \ufb01t of Figure 15. In the\nlatter case, our formula (5.39) for the rightmost boundary-sink eigenvalue is no longer valid,\nand we determine this eigenvalue numerically using \ufb01nite di\ufb00erences. Both approximations\nresult in an eigenvalue \u039b0 that destabilizes prior to the essential spectrum. The predicted\nparameter values for the onset of the point instability are C = 2.99, when taking b\u02c62 = 9.06,\nand C = 3.06 for the approximation by the quartic polynomial, compared with the value\nC = 2.96 indicated by the direct simulations from Figure 13. Thus, while the predicted and\nmeasured values for onset disagree, the amplitude equation does predict that the instability\nis caused by a point eigenvalue of the boundary sink rather than by the absolute spectrum.\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 541\nFigure 16. Schematic plots of spiral spectra on large disks are shown in the complex plane under the\nassumption that the asymptotic wave trains undergo a period-doubling bifurcation: Solid lines represent the part\nof the absolute spectrum associated with period-doubling modes, solid bullets mark eigenvalues, and the dotted\nlines indicate where Im\u03bb = \u03c9\u2217\/2. Also plotted are the rotation and translation eigenvalues at \u03bb \u2248 0,\u00b1i\u03c9\u2217\nwhich persist on large disks. Note that absolute spiral spectra are periodic along the imaginary axis with period\ni\u03c9\u2217. The di\ufb00erent cases, and their meanings, are discussed further in section 7.\n7. Discussion.\nPeriod-doubling of spiral waves. In this paper, we investigated period-doubling bifurca-\ntions of 1D sources and 2D spiral waves. We started from the observation that period-doubling\nof sources and spirals must actually be a Hopf bifurcation at precisely half the temporal fre-\nquency \u03c9\u2217 of these patterns. This observation led to a prediction and a puzzle: The prediction\nis that period-doubled spirals should drift due to the 2:1 resonance of Hopf and rotation fre-\nquency, and we indeed found numerical evidence that period-doubled spirals in the Ro\u00a8ssler\nsystem drift, albeit slowly.\nThe puzzle, and indeed the central theme of this paper, is the nature of the mechanism that\ncauses the imaginary parts of the Hopf eigenvalues to lock to \u03c9\u2217\/2 in a robust fashion. Indeed,\nwith no extra structure present, temporal Hopf bifurcations at isolated point eigenvalues\n\u03bbH with Im\u03bbH = \u03c9\u2217\/2 have codimension two and not one, as observed experimentally and\nnumerically. The resolution to this issue, put forward in this paper, is as follows. The spiral\nwaves emerging at the locked Hopf bifurcation exhibit a period-doubled spatial structure in\nthe far \ufb01eld. This suggests that the locked Hopf bifurcation is caused by period-doubling of\nthe asymptotic wave trains in the far \ufb01eld of the spiral wave. Thus, we assumed that the\nasymptotic wave trains undergo a period-doubling bifurcation, as solutions to the traveling-\nwave ODE or to the reaction-di\ufb00usion system on the real line, and investigated the implications\nfor spiral spectra on large bounded domains. We found that there are four generic cases for how\nthe critical, neutrally stable parts of spiral spectra may look, of which three are consistent with\nspatio-temporal period-doubling of spiral waves. These four cases are illustrated in Figure 16,\nand we discuss them now in more detail.\nFirst, we recall that the absolute spectrum associated with the period-doubling modes of\nthe asymptotic wave trains is invariant under re\ufb02ections across the line Im\u03bb = \u03c9\u2217\/2. Hence,\nbranches of the absolute spectrum are either symmetric, i.e., contained in the line of re\ufb02ection\n(Figure 16(ii)), or asymmetric, i.e., not intersecting this line (Figure 16(i)); both cases are\ngeneric, and symmetric spectrum leads to robust Hopf bifurcations with frequency \u03c9\u2217\/2, while\nasymmetric spectrum does not. We also showed that the critical part of the absolute spectrum\n542 BJO\u00a8RN SANDSTEDE AND ARND SCHEEL\nis always symmetric if the wave trains have su\ufb03ciently small wave number, that is, are close to\nbeing spatially homogeneous. We stress that the absolute spectrum repeats itself periodically\nin the vertical direction with period i\u03c9\u2217, so that there are in\ufb01nitely many branches of absolute\nspectrum that cross the imaginary axis simultaneously.\nBesides the PDE eigenvalues that lie near the absolute spectrum and accumulate onto it\nas the domain size increases, other isolated eigenvalues may arise in three di\ufb00erent ways:\n(1) Discrete eigenvalues and resonance poles of the planar spiral wave persist on large\ndomains.\n(2) A family of discrete eigenvalues may emerge from the edges of the absolute spectrum\nas indicated in Figure 16(iii), depending on a certain sign condition derived in [41].\n(3) Discrete eigenvalues and resonance poles of the boundary sink that accommodates the\nboundary conditions persist on large domains.\nAs argued above, the resulting eigenvalues from (1), which can be associated with the core of\nthe spiral wave, typically have an imaginary part di\ufb00erent from \u03c9\u2217\/2. The eigenvalues from (2)\nemerge from the edge of each of the in\ufb01nitely many branches of the absolute spectrum and\nare due to the 1\/r curvature terms in the Laplacian: they have an imaginary part close to\n\u03c9\u2217\/2 and lead therefore to spatio-temporal period-doubling. Last, Neumann boundary sinks\nmay, as shown in section 5.4, have a simple eigenvalue near the line Im\u03bb = \u03c9\u2217\/2 for wave\ntrains that are almost spatially homogeneous; see Figure 16(iv). For the Ro\u00a8ssler system with\nNeumann conditions, the evidence presented in section 6 indicates that period-doubling of\nspirals is caused by the boundary sink as illustrated in Figure 16(iv).\nThe conclusions on the di\ufb00erent possible spectral instability scenarios presented above are\nvalid for generic boundary conditions. We also expect them to hold when domain boundaries\nare replaced by interfaces to other patterns. One example is period-doubling of spiral waves\nin domains with periodic boundary conditions which has been reported in [15, Figure 1a].\nThe e\ufb00ective boundary for each spiral wave is then given by the Lax-shock interface that is\nformed between wave trains that propagate toward each other.\nA key ingredient to realizing spatio-temporal period-doubling of spirals in a given reaction-\ndi\ufb00usion system is therefore that the associated traveling-wave ODE exhibits period-doubling\nbifurcations of wave trains or periodic orbits. Besides the Ro\u00a8ssler system (1.3) and the related\nthree-component Willamoski\u2013Ro\u00a8ssler system (see [16] and references therein), we are not aware\nof any systems that exhibit period-doubling bifurcations of wave trains, although these have\nbeen observed in lattice maps [1].\nWhile our spectral analysis is rigorous, large parts of our nonlinear analysis are only\nformal. For instance, the prediction of drift for truncated sources is based on the reduced\nequation (3.8) on an appropriate center manifold: It is not clear whether the center-manifold\nreduction is valid in a uniform region near the source, and not even whether the Taylor jet\nof the reduced vector \ufb01eld has a limit as the domain diameter goes to in\ufb01nity. Similarly, we\nare currently not able to analyze the nonlinear bifurcation of spiral waves on the plane or on\nlarge bounded disks. The situation for spirals is worse, compared to that of 1D sources, as\nin\ufb01nitely many copies of essential and absolute spectra cross the imaginary axis simultaneously\nat \u03bb = i\u03c9\u2217\/2 + i\u03c9\u2217\u0007 with \u0007 \u2208 Z.\nLine defects. The line defect visible in Figure 1(ii) is another interesting aspect of the\nspatio-temporal period-doubling of spiral waves. Previous work on line defects (see [16, 29, 48])\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 543\nFigure 17. A snapshot of a period-doubled spiral wave with \ufb01ve interacting line defects is plotted for the\nRo\u00a8ssler system (6.1) with C = 3.4.\nmodeled line defects using kinetic theory. We clari\ufb01ed the structure of line defects near onset in\nsystems where the asymptotic wave trains are close to spatially homogeneous by showing that\nthey are sources or reversible contact defects. The spatial asymptotics of spiral eigenmodes\nin (4.11), which re\ufb02ects the periodicity of spiral spectra in the complex plane, indicate that\nmultiple line defects are possible as higher harmonics of a single line defect, and Figure 17\nshows that several line defects can indeed be excited near onset. Neighboring line defects\ntypically attract each other, which eventually leads to pairwise annihilation. Preliminary\nanalyses show that the time scales of this interaction depend strongly on whether the line\ndefects are of source or contact type.\nBesides straight line defects similar to those shown in Figure 1(ii), other types of defects\nhave been observed in experiments. Examples are line defects2 which curl around and form\nspirals. For the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction, stationary defects of this type were \ufb01rst\nfound in [27], while meandering curved line defects were reported in [28]. In [16, 27], line-\ndefect turbulence, consisting of turbulent states that are mediated by curved line defects which\ninteract in a complicated way, was observed in experiments and numerical simulations.\nPeriod-doubling cascades. The Ro\u00a8ssler ODE exhibits a period-doubling cascade, and\none may therefore expect to see a cascade of period-doubling bifurcations of spirals in the\nRo\u00a8ssler PDE (1.3). Higher-order period-doubling of spiral waves has indeed been observed\nexperimentally and numerically in [14, 27]. The conclusions of our spectral analysis remain\nvalid for these bifurcations as they rely only on the spectral properties of the asymptotic wave\ntrains. As discussed in [14, 16], higher-order period-doubling engenders di\ufb00erent types of line\ndefects which mediate between di\ufb00erent individual wave trains in a period-k orbit. We refer\nthe reader to [14, Figure 6] for an illustration and to [16] for an extensive discussion of the\ndi\ufb00erent types of line defects that occur in higher-order period-doubling bifurcations of spiral\nwaves.\nAppendix A.

Floquet multipliers \u03c1 can be found by seeking nontrivial\nsolutions v0 to \u03a6\n\u2032\nT v0 = \u03c1v0, where T = 2\u03c0\/\u03c9\u2217 denotes the temporal period of the source u\u2217.\nWriting\nv(x, t) = e\u039btu(x, t)\nfor v(x, t) = \u03a6\u2032tv0, we see that \u03c1 = e\u039bT is a Floquet multiplier if and only if u(x, t) satis\ufb01es\nut = Duxx + fu(u\u2217(x, t);\u03bc)u\u2212 \u039bu, x \u2208 (\u2212L,L),(A.1)\n0 = ux(\u00b1L, t),\nwith u(x, t) being T -periodic in t. As in [38, section 4.1], we write (A.1) as\n(A.2)\n(\nux\nvx\n)\n=\n(\n0 1\nD\u22121[\u2202t \u2212 fu(u\u2217(x, t);\u03bc) + \u039b] 0\n)(\nu\nv\n)\n,\nwith u = (u, v) \u2208 X := H1\/2per (0, T )\u00d7L2per(0, T ) for all x, together with the boundary conditions\nu(\u00b1L) \u2208 H1\/2per (0, T )\u00d7 {0}.\nWe want to prove that the Floquet spectrum of the truncated source u\u2217 is the union of two\ndisjoint sets: One of these approaches the absolute spectrum of the asymptotic wave trains\nuwt(k\u2217x\u2212\u03c9\u2217t) in the symmetric Hausdor\ufb00 distance as L\u2192\u221e, while the other one converges\nto the union of the extended point spectra of the source on R and the two boundary sinks.\nThis issue has previously been addressed in [34] in the case where the linearized problem (A.2)\nis an ODE.\nThe convergence proof for the absolute spectrum in [34, section 5.3] involves only exponen-\ntial dichotomies and Lyapunov\u2013Schmidt reduction and therefore carries over immediately to\n(A.2) once the absolute spectrum of the wave trains uwt is identi\ufb01ed. For constant-coe\ufb03cient\nproblems\nux = A(\u039b)u, u \u2208 R2n,\nthe absolute spectrum is given by\n\u03a3abs = {\u039b \u2208 C; Re \u03bdn = Re \u03bdn+1},\nwhere \u03bdj = \u03bdj(\u039b) with j = 1, . . . , 2n are the eigenvalues of the matrix A(\u039b), ordered with\nincreasing real part. The corresponding de\ufb01nition for (A.2) uses spatial Floquet exponents\ninstead of eigenvalues. We consider the asymptotic 2\u03c0\/k\u2217-periodic system\nux =\n(\n0 1\nD\u22121[\u2202t \u2212 fu(uwt(k\u2217x\u2212 \u03c9\u2217t);\u03bc) + \u039b] 0\n)\nu\nPERIOD-DOUBLING OF SPIRAL WAVES AND DEFECTS 545\nwhose spatial Floquet exponents \u03bd are found by seeking solutions u \u2208 X of the form\nu(x, t) = e\u03bdxu0(k\u2217x\u2212 \u03c9\u2217t),\nwhere u0 is 2\u03c0-periodic in its argument. As shown in [37, Proposition 2.10 and section 4]\nor [38, section 3.4], there are in\ufb01nitely many spatial Floquet exponents \u03bdj(\u039b) for each \ufb01xed\n\u039b which, alternatively, can also be found as roots \u03bd of the function D(\u039b, \u03bd). Ordering the\nresulting roots \u03bdj by increasing real part, we end up with the absolute spectrum (2.19) of\nthe wave trains in the laboratory frame. With this identi\ufb01cation, the proofs given in [34,\nsection 5.3] for the absolute spectrum carry over to (A.2).\nIt remains to prove that the remaining spectrum converges to the union of the extended\npoint spectra of the source on R and the boundary sinks. There are two di\ufb00erent proofs\nthat give this result: First, we may invoke [32], where the spectrum of concatenated multi-\npulses was investigated, using again only exponential dichotomies and Lyapunov\u2013Schmidt\nreduction. An alternative proof uses the same topological winding-number arguments based\non Evans functions as in [34, section 4.3] but now applied to a \ufb01nite-dimensional Galerkin\napproximation of (A.2). It is a consequence of the results proved in [21, 37] that a su\ufb03ciently\nhigh-dimensional Galerkin approximation captures all eigenvalues of the truncated source.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R. E.
