In the real \nworld, of course, trade can involve long chains \nof potentially independent actors who move \ngoods through wholesale and retail distribution \nnetworks.

We explore the ramifications \nof using a sharp 100 percent cutoff in defin-\ning W and R firms by further dividing mixed \nfirms into \u201cmixed wholesale-retail\u201d (MWR) and \n\u201cmixed producer-consumer\u201d (MPC) according \nto whether wholesaling plus retailing in these \nfirms accounts for more or less than 75 percent \nof employment. Together, W, R, PC, MWR, and \nMPC firms are mutually exclusive and exhaus-\ntive. Unfortunately, we cannot compare firms \nin the LFTTD to those which trade \u201cindirectly\u201d \nvia wholesalers or retailers, as we do not observe \nthe latter\u2019s sales or purchases within the United \nStates.\nTable 1 reports a breakdown of trading firms \nand value by type of firm for 2002. Collectively, \npure wholesalers and retailers account for \n4 Most\u2014but not all\u2014of the pure firms are single-\nestablishment firms. Firms with employment split between \nwholesale and retail are allocated to W or R according to \nwhichever is higher.\nlarge shares of trading firms but relatively lit-\ntle value, with wholesalers being around four \ntimes more prevalent and responsible for con-\nsiderably more trade than retailers. PC firms \nare most numerous on the export side and as \nnumerous as Ws on the import side and rep-\nresent roughly one fifth of export and import \nvalue. Mixed firms are rarest but account for \nthe majority of trade. This dominance is stron-\nger for exports than imports, though MWR \nimporters are relatively more important for \nimports than for exports. The country compo-\nsition of trade also varies substantially across \nfirm types and between exports and imports, \nwith trade with China accounting for by far the \nlargest share of total trade for W, R, and MWR \nimporters.5\nII. Wholesaler and Retailer \u201cPremia\u201d\nIt is well known that trading firms differ from \npurely domestic firms along a number of dimen-\nsions. Here, we demonstrate substantial hetero-\ngeneity within trading firms.\nTable 2 reports non-PC firms\u2019 \u201cpremia\u201d rela-\ntive to PC firms\u2019 in 2002.

W, R, and MWR import-\ners all trade with countries with a lower average \nGDP per capita than PC firms do.\nResults with respect to unit values are less \nclear. Perhaps intuitively, W, R, and MWR \nexporters have relatively low unit values within \nproduct-country cells and firm size deciles than \neither MPC or PC firms. On the other hand, \nwhile W and MWR importers have relatively \nlow unit values, we find that R importers have \nrelatively high unit values.\nIII. Product-Country Determinants of \nIntermediation\nThe third column of each panel in Table 1 \nreveals that R and MWR firms participate in \nfewer product-country markets than W, PC, and \nMPC firms. Even among the latter, however, \nparticipation is well below 100 percent. In this \nsection, we examine product and country char-\nacteristics that influence market participation.\nWe correlate the share of trade value \naccounted for by each type of firm across prod-\nucts. As reported in our online Appendix, two \nfeatures stand out. First, intermediaries\u2019 corre-\nlations with nonintermediaries are negative for \nboth exports and imports, indicating these firms \nspecialize in different sets of goods. Second, the \nshares of product trade due to PC versus MPC \nfirms are also negatively correlated. This result \nsuggests producer and consumer firms may \ndevelop in-house wholesaling or retailing capa-\nbilities depending on the products they produce, \nor vice versa.\nIn our online Appendix, we report the share of \nexport and import value accounted for by each \ntype of firm across two-digit HS categories. Pure \nwholesalers tend to concentrate in agriculture-\nrelated sectors such as Animal and Vegetable \nproducts in both exports and imports. PCs and \nMPCs, on the other hand, focus more on indus-\ntries more likely to contain differentiated goods, \nsuch as Transportation. Among importers, we \nfind that MWRs are disproportionately active in \nTextiles, Clothing, and Footwear. Correlations \nbetween the product value shares of exporters \nversus importers within firm types are positive \nand statistically significant.\nFinally, as reported in our online Appendix, \nwe find that the share of exports and imports \nmediated by pure wholesalers declines with \nmarket size, from 0.20 (0.25) for the smallest \nquintile of destination (source) markets to 0.07 (0.14) for the largest. Pure wholesalers therefore \nhave relatively greater penetration of small mar-\nkets, whereas for MPC firms we find the oppo-\nsite pattern.\nIV. Gravity\nA long line of research in international trade \nhighlights the importance of \u201cgravity\u201d in deter-\nmining trade flows. Here, we examine the role \nof country characteristics in influencing market \nparticipation by estimating gravity equations for \neach firm type.\nTable 3 reports the results of two country-level \nOLS regressions. In the top panel, log aggregate \ntrade value for each type of firm is regressed on \npartner countries\u2019 log GDP and log great-circle \ndistance from the United States (in km).8 In the \nsecond panel, the \u201cextensive\u201d component of \nlog value, i.e., the log number of firm-product \nobservations with positive trade, is regressed \non these variables. The difference between the \ncoefficients in the top and bottom panels is the \ncontribution of the \u201cintensive\u201d component of log \nvalue, i.e., the log average value per firm-product \nobservation with positive trade. Explicit results \nfor the intensive margin, and for pure retailers, \nare available in our online Appendix.\nResults for exports are straightforward: trade \nvalue falls with distance and rises with mar-\nket size. Moreover, gravity\u2019s stronger effect on \nextensive versus intensive margins across the \nboard is consistent with recent research on the \nmargins of trade. Comparing the coefficient on \nGDP across columns, we find W trade is less \nsensitive to market size than MPC trade, con-\nsistent with the former\u2019s declining market share \nacross GDP quintiles noted above. This differ-\nential response is disproportionately due to the \nintensive margin. The difference in coefficients \non log GDP between MWR and MPC firms ver-\nsus other types of firms is larger for the intensive \nmargin than the extensive margin.\nResults for imports are less conventional. \nWhile we find the expected positive relation-\nship between market size and import value, \n8 These data are from the World Bank and CEPII, \nrespectively. The mean (standard deviation) of these vari-\nables are 25 (2) and 8 (0.7), respectively.\nMAY 2010412 AEA PAPERs AND PROCEEDiNGs\ndistance has a negative and statistically sig-\nnificant relationship with import value and the \nextensive margin only for PC and MPC firms. \nFor intermediaries, the relationship is negative \nbut statistically insignificant for Ws and positive \nbut statistically insignificant for Rs and MWRs. \nOne factor contributing to this result is the rela-\ntively heavy concentration of Rs and MWRs in \nconsumer goods (e.g., footwear) that are dispro-\nportionately imported from far-away China, as \nreflected in the results reported in Tables 1 and \n2. Indeed, across two-digit HS categories, R \nand MWR importers\u2019 value shares are strongly \npositively correlated with China\u2019s import mar-\nket shares. Analogous correlations with respect \nto PC and MPC firms\u2019 shares are statistically \ninsignificant but negative.\nV. Conclusions\nTrading firms exhibit substantial hetero-\ngeneity and can be quite different from the \n\u201c stylized\u201d trading firm emphasized in much \nof the recent literature in international trade. \nWhile pure wholesalers are relatively numerous, \nthey are on average smaller than pure produc-\ners and account for a relatively small share of \ntrade value. While pure wholesalers are concen-\ntrated in agriculture-related sectors, pure pro-\nducers and mixed firms are more prevalent in \nindustries more likely to contain differentiated \ngoods, such as transportation. Pure wholesalers \nare relatively less sensitive to market size and \nimport disproportionately from China and other \n low-wage countries. Together with differences \nin product specialization, this leads to depar-\ntures on the import side from the standard grav-\nity equation predictions for trade.\nREFERENCES\nAhn, J.B., Amit Khandelwal, and Shang-Jin \nWei. 2010. \u201cThe Role of Intermediaries in \nTable 3\u2014Country-Level Gravity, 2002\nExports Imports\nW PC MWR MPC W PC MWR MPC\nln(Value)\nln(Distancec) \u22121.55*** \u22121.33*** \u22121.64*** \u22121.42*** \u22120.31 \u22121.19*** 0.24 \u22120.99***\n0.21 0.17 0.24 0.20 0.23 0.26 0.41 0.26\nln(GDPc) 0.93*** 0.92*** 1.03*** 1.13*** 1.15*** 1.27*** 1.28*** 1.28***\n0.04 0.04 0.06 0.04 0.05 0.05 0.10 0.06\nConstant 8.95*** 8.02*** 5.07* 4.67** \u22126.7*** \u22121.6 \u221216.1*** \u22123.1\n2.13 1.84 2.72 2.06 2.30 2.70 4.00 2.83\nObservations 173 175 157 174 171 172 147 170\nR2 0.76 0.74 0.66 0.81 0.72 0.73 0.53 0.69\nln(Extensive margin)\nln(Distancec ) \u22121.66*** \u22121.28*** \u22121.67*** \u22121.28*** \u22120.20 \u22120.73*** 0.37 \u22120.72***\n0.19 0.14 0.21 0.17 0.18 0.16 0.24 0.16\nln(GDPc ) 0.73*** 0.82*** 0.74*** 0.80*** 0.97*** 0.96*** 0.93*** 0.97***\n0.04 0.03 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.06 0.04\nConstant 3.62* \u22121.36 1.37 \u22121.01 \u221215.5*** \u221210.7*** \u221221.1*** \u221211.0***\n2.01 1.70 2.24 1.88 1.80 1.77 2.25 1.73\nObservations 173 175 157 174 171 172 147 170\nR2 0.75 0.79 0.68 0.73 0.74 0.79 0.60 0.79\nNotes: Table reports country-level OLS regressions for two dependent variables: log aggregate value per country (top panel) \nand log number of firm-product observations with positive trade per country (bottom panel).
