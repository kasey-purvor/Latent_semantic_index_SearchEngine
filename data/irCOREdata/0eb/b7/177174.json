The biological function of this response and its interplay with\nother parts of innate host defence reactions remain somewhat elusive. In order to gain new insight\ninto this early host defence response in the context of bacterial infection we studied gene expression\nchanges in peripheral lymphoid tissues as compared to hepatic expression changes, 14\u201318 h after lung\ninfection in pigs. The lung infection was established with the pig speci\ufb01c respiratory pathogen\nActinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Quantitative real-time PCR based expression analysis were\nperformed on samples from liver, tracheobronchial lymph node, tonsils, spleen and on blood\nleukocytes, supplemented with measurements of interleukin-6 and selected acute phase proteins in\nserum. C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A were clearly induced 14\u201318 h after infection.\nExtrahepatic expression of acute phase proteins was found to be dramatically altered as a result of\nthe lung infection with an extrahepatic acute phase protein response occurring concomitantly with\nthe hepatic response. This suggests that the acute phase protein response is a more disseminated\nsystemic response than previously thought. The current study provides to our knowledge the \ufb01rst\nexample of porcine extrahepatic expression and regulation of C-reactive protein, haptoglobin,\n\ufb01brinogen, pig major acute phase protein, and transferrin in peripheral lymphoid tissues.\nacute phase protein \/ systemic response \/ innate defence \/ gene expression \/ pig\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe acute phase response is a well-orches-\ntrated series of early host response events playing\nan important role in innate immunity of all verte-\nbrates, where it is believed to help restore homeo-\nstasis after e.g. infection or other events involving\nsome degree of tissue destruction [5]. Altered\nhepatic synthesis of a wide spectrum of acute\nphaseproteins (APP), is oneof themainoutcomes\nof the acute phase response. APP are de\ufb01ned as\nany serum protein whose plasma concentration\nincreases (positive APP) or decreases (negative\nAPP) more than 25% after infection, in\ufb02amma-\ntion, trauma, and some types of cancer [27].\nAPP have been known since the discovery of\nC-reactive protein (CRP) in 1941 [1], however,\nalthough widely used as markers of infection\nand in\ufb02ammation in human and veterinary\nclinicalmedicine [39], little is knownof the signif-\nicance of the APP response and its interplay with\nother types of innate defence responses. Some\nAPP have functions directly associated with host\ndefences e.g. by promoting wound repair (\ufb01brin-\nogen, FIB), enhancing phagocytosis (CRP), bind-\ning of hemoglobin and reducing oxidative* Corresponding author: kesk@vet.dtu.dk\nVet.

However, the role of\nother APP as e.g. serum amyloid A (SAA),\nwhich is a very dominant APP in most species,\nis less evident or speculative [8, 49]. The liver is\nthe major producer of APP [14]. Extrahepatic\nexpression ofAPPhas beendemonstrated inmice\nundergoing lipopolysaccharide induced systemic\n[23, 35], and local (lung [46]) in\ufb02ammation. In\naddition, non-hepatic production of SAA, hapto-\nglobin (Hp) and a1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) has\nbeen described in themammary gland and in lung\ntissue ofmice, primates, and cattle during various\ninfections [10, 34, 48]. Knowledge on the extra-\nhepatic production and regulation of APP in por-\ncine peripheral lymphoid tissues is scarce. In a\nrecent study, Hiss et al. [19] demonstrated an\nincreased number of Hp-positive cells (epithelial\ncells and immigrated leukocytes) in lungs from\npigs with bronchopneumonia, supporting a role\nfor Hp as a hemoglobin scavenger during extrav-\nasation of erythrocytes into the lungs. Naranjo\net al. [36] demonstrated elevation of SAAmRNA\nand decrease of albumin (ALB) and apolipopro-\ntein A-I (APOA1) protein in lymph nodes of\nEuropean wild boars after natural infection with\nMycobacterium bovis.\nThe objective of the present study was to\ngain new insight into the nature and regulation\nof the APP response shortly after establishment\nof a localized bacterial infection with speci\ufb01c\nemphasis on the role played by non-hepatic tis-\nsues different from the infection locus. As also\nnoted by Kalmovarin et al. [23] extrahepatic\nexpression of APP could serve as an ef\ufb01cient\nrapid response to local infection and would\nadd to the biological importance of the APP\nresponse. Thus we hypothesized that the APP\nresponse would occur in a disseminated man-\nner, mobilizing different tissues simultaneously\nwith the liver to produce APP. To study this,\npigs were experimentally infected with Actino-\nbacillus pleuropneumoniae. This Gram nega-\ntive bacterium causes an acute and very\nrapidly evolving pleuropneumonia in pigs,\nreliably reproduced by an endotracheal\/\nintratracheal infection model [25]. As pleuro-\npneumonia caused by A. pleuropneumoniae is\nhighly relevant in intensive pig production\nworldwide, some aspects of the accompanying\nhost responses have previously been published,\nincluding cytokine, APP and cellular responses\nin serum and blood [17, 21], in lung tissue [2]\nand in lung macrophages [20]. Porcine APP\nfor which correlations between serum concen-\ntrations and disease have been studied [21,\n28], include CRP, SAA, Hp, FIB, AGP, and\npig major acute phase protein (pigMAP) also\nknown as inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy\nchain 4 (ITIH4) as positive APP and ALB,\nAPOA1, transthyretin (TTR), and transferrin\n(TF) as negative APP [7, 39, 43].\nWe report here for the \ufb01rst time a detailed\nstudy of the changes in expression of APP in\nseveral porcine tissues after experimental A.\npleuropneumoniae infection. Expression pat-\nterns of innate immune factors including a\nselection of the APP and the key pro-in\ufb02amma-\ntory mediator interleukin-6 (IL-6) were com-\npared between tonsils, spleen, trancheo-\nbronchial lymph nodes, blood leukocytes, and\nliver. In addition, protein serum concentrations\nof selected APP and IL-6 were determined. It\nwas demonstrated that APP expression and\nacute phase regulation were disseminated to a\nwide range of tissues throughout the body as\nearly as 14\u201318 h after experimental lung\ninfection.\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\n2.1. Experimental infections, tissue collection\nand RNA extraction\nTwelve 8\u201310-week-old castrates of Danish Land-\nrace\/Yorkshire\/Duroc crosses from a high health\nherd, free from A. pleuropneumoniae, (pigs Nos.\n25\u201336) were inoculated intranasally with A. pleuro-\npneumoniae serotype 5b, isolate L20 as described\npreviously by Skovgaard et al. [42]. Five non-inocu-\nlated pigs from the same herd constituted the non-\ninoculated control group (pigs Nos. 20\u201324). The\nlow number of animals in the control group was\naccepted, as this group was believed to behave in a\nmore homogeneous way than the inoculated group.\nAll animal procedures were approved by the Danish\nAnimal Experiments Inspectorate.\nCultivation of bacteria as well as inoculation of\nthe pigs were performed as previously described\n[25]. Animals were sacri\ufb01ced 14\u201318 h after inocula-\ntion and necropsied immediately. Severity of lung\nlesions were rated using the following scale: 0: no\nVet. Res. (2009) 40:23 K. Skovgaard et al.\nPage 2 of 12 (page number not for citation purpose)\nlesions; 1: 1 or 2 lesions < 15 mm in diameter; 2:\n1 or 2 lesions (each < 50 mm in diameter) or a few\nscattered petechiae; 3: more than two lesions (each\n< 50 mm in diameter) or numerous scattered pete-\nchiae; 4: more severe than 3 [3]. The inoculation\nstrain, A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5B, was\nre-isolated from all 12 inoculated animals and from\nnone of the 5 control animals. Ten of the 12 inoculated\npigs developed characteristic, well-demarcated, lung\nlesions of variable severity (5 pigs with a lung lesion\nscore (LLS) of 4 and 5 pigswith aLLSof 3). Two inoc-\nulated pigs (Nos. 29 and 35) showed no pathological\nchanges deriving from lung infection (LLS =\n0) and were therefore excluded from the gene expres-\nsion analyses. No pathological changes were seen in\nlungs from the 5 control animals.\nTissue samples of approximately 500 mg were\ntaken from liver, tracheobronchial lymph nodes,\nspleen, and tonsils. All samples were snap frozen in\nliquid nitrogen and stored at \u000280 \u0003C until RNA\nextraction. Blood samples for RNA extraction were\ncollected in tubes containing heparin (HEP tubes,\nTerumo, Herlev, Denmark). Leukocytes were immedi-\nately isolated by centrifugation (400 g for 10 min at\n4 \u0003C) after depletion of red blood cells using QIAamp\nhypotonic EL buffer (Qiagen, Albertslund, Denmark),\nand stored at\u000280 \u0003Cuntil RNAextraction [42].Blood\nsamples for serum ELISA were collected as unstabi-\nlized samples and allowed to clot for 1\u20132 h at room\ntemperature or at 4 \u0003C overnight before harvesting\nserum. Serum was kept at \u000220 \u0003C until analysis. To\nre-isolate the inoculation strain, samples from lung,\nliver, tonsils and spleen were cultivated on PPLO agar\n(BD Diagnostic Systems, Br\u00f8ndby, Denmark) and\nserotyped using latex agglutination [13].\nTotal RNA from liver, tracheobronchial lymph\nnodes, spleen, tonsils, and leukocytes were extracted\nas previously described using RNeasy midi kit, Qia-\ngen (liver), RNeasy lipid midi tissue kit, Qiagen\n(lymph nodes, tonsils, and spleen), and QIAamp\nRNA blood, Qiagen (leukocytes) [42]. All RNA sam-\nples were treated with RNase-free DNase Set,\nQiagen, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nQuantity and quality of extracted total RNA was\nmeasured using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectropho-\ntometer (Saveen and Werner AB, Limhamn, Sweden)\nand the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technolo-\ngies, N\u00e6rum, Denmark) respectively. The Agilent\nBioanalyser assigns a RNA Integrity Number (RIN)\nfrom 1\u201310 to each total RNA sample, with 10 being\nnon-degraded RNA. All samples in the present study\nhad a RIN number above 7. Moderately degraded\nsamples (RIN between 4 and 6) were previously\nshown to be applicable to expression analysis pro-\nvided that careful normalization is performed [11].\n2.2. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nTotalRNAwas converted into\ufb01rst-strand cDNAby\nreverse transcription ofRNAusingQuantiTectReverse\nTranscription (Qiagen) according to themanufacturer\u2019s\ninstruction. The cDNAwas stored at\u000220 \u0003C until fur-\nther use. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a\nRotorGene 3000 Detection System (Corbett Research,\nSydney, Australia) using ampliQ Universal Real Time\nMastermix (Bie&Berntsen,R\u00f8dovre,Denmark), tem-\nplate cDNA, and gene speci\ufb01c primers (Tab. I) as\ndescribed previously [42]. Melting curves were gener-\nated after each run to con\ufb01rm a single PCRproduct. All\nreactions were performed in triplicate and outliers were\nexcluded using the Tn test [31]. Standard curves gener-\nated from dilution series constructed from high\nresponding samples were used to assign relative con-\ncentrations to all samples. The freely available software\nPrimer31 was used for primer design, while gene\nsequences were obtained from public databases and\nfrom the Sino-Danish Pig Genome Project [30]. If pos-\nsible, primers were designed to span intron\/exon\nboundaries to prevent ampli\ufb01cation of contaminating\ngenomic DNA, if present. BLAST searches were per-\nformed to ensure the absence of intraspecies polymor-\nphisms at the primer site.\nValidity of qRT-PCR data relies on accurate nor-\nmalization of gene expression data, as RNA recovery\nand cDNA synthesis ef\ufb01ciency might vary from sam-\nple to sample. In the present study, all data were care-\nfully normalized to the geometric mean of the three\nmost stably expressed reference genes as described\nby Vandesompele et al. [45]. Tissue speci\ufb01c reference\ngenes were selected using the dedicated validation\nprogram geNorm, ranking six potential reference\ngenes (hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl-transferase 1\n(HPRT1), ribosomal protein L13a (RPL13A), phos-\nphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain containing\n1B (HTPAP), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), glyceral-\ndehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and\nb-actin) that were analysed in all tissues, from best\nto worst based on the stability of their expression. A\nnormalization factor based on GAPDH, HPRT1, and\nHTPAP was used to standardize liver expression data\nbetween animals, as these geneswere found to bemost\nconstantly expressed in this tissue using the geNorm\nsoftware. Likewise, expression data were normalized\nwith HPRT1, RPL13A, and HTPAP in leukocytes,\nHPRT1, b-actin, and HTPAP in tracheobronchial\nlymph nodes and RPL13A, B2M, and HPRT1 in\ntonsils, as well as HTPAP, b-actin, and GAPDH in\n1 http:\/\/frodo.wi.mit.edu\/cgi-bin\/primer3\/primer3www.\ncgi.\nDisseminated acute phase protein response Vet.

GAPDH, b-actin, and RPL13Awere used for\ndata normalization in the analysis of gene expression\ndifferences between different tissues. To visualize\ndifferential expression of genes between the 10 out\nof 12 infected pigs revealing characteristic lung\nlesions, and the 5 non-infected control animals, the\nmean, normalized value for the infected groupwas dis-\nplayed relative to the mean normalized value for the\ncontrol group, set to 1. Results are presented as the\nmean \u00b1 standard error (SEM) and Wilcoxon rank\nsum test was performed to test for signi\ufb01cance of gene\nexpression. To demonstrate that the Wilcoxon rank\nsum test was robust with regards to the relatively\nlow number of animals, the statistical power was esti-\nmated for eight APP expressed in the liver, using a per-\nmutation test with 10 000 resamplings.\n2.3. Quantitative serum ELISA\nSerum concentrations of the acute phase proteins\nCRP, SAA, Hp, and TTR were determined in two\ncontrol and in all 12 infected animals at \u00021 and day\n1 after the infection. CRP was analysed by a sandwich\ntype ELISA using dendrimer-coupled cytidine diph-\nosphocholine (a CRP-binding ligand) in the coating\nlayer as described in [18] employing polyclonal rabbit\nanti-human antibodies with cross-reactivity towards\nporcine CRP followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat\nanti rabbit antibody for detection (both antibodies\nfrom DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark).

Pooled pig serum calibrated\nagainst a human CRP calibrator (DAKO A0073)\nwas used as standard. The detection limit was\n0.067 mg\/L (human equivalents). A commercially\navailable sandwich ELISA assay (Phase SAA assay,\nTridelta Development Ltd., Kildare, Ireland) was used\nfor determination of SAA. This assay is based on anti-\nhuman monoclonal antibodies in a sandwich set-up as\noriginally described byMcDonald et al. [33]. Samples\nwere tested according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruc-\ntions except that the lowest dilution was 1:20 to\nincrease signal intensity. The detection limit of the\nassay was 2.5 mg\/L (porcine SAA equivalents). Hp\nwas determined by a sandwich ELISA using an in-\nhouse mouse anti-porcine Hp monoclonal antibody\nin the coating layer and biotinylated commercial rab-\nbit anti human haptoglobin (DAKO A0030) as the\ndetection antibody as described previously [43] with\na detection limit of 3.3 mg\/L (porcine Hp equiva-\nlents). All of the ELISA described above were devel-\noped using orthophenylenediamine (OPD)\/peroxide\nand reading optical densities of wells at 490 nm sub-\ntracting unspeci\ufb01c coloration at 650 nm using an\nautomatic plate reader (ThermoMultiskan Ex spectro-\nphotometer, Thermo Scienti\ufb01c, Waltham, MA, USA).\nAll samples including standards were determined in\nduplicate. Sample values were calculated from the\ncurve \ufb01tted to the readings of the standard (using\nAscent software v. 2.6, Thermo Scienti\ufb01c). TTR\nwas measured using an in-house ELISA, as described\npreviously by Campbell et al. [6]. Diluted serum sam-\nples or puri\ufb01ed human prealbumin (TTR) (used as\nstandard) (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) were used to\ncoat microtiter plates (96 well, Corning Costar, Cam-\nbridge, UK) and TTR was detected using sheep anti-\nhuman prealbumin (IgG fraction) (ICN Biomedicals,\nBasingstoke, UK) followed by peroxidase-conjugated\nanti-sheep IgG (Sigma). Plates were developed\nwith tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution\n(KPL, Guildford, UK), the reaction was stopped with\n1M HCl and absorbance read at 450 nm. TTR con-\ncentrations in the serum samples were compared to\na standard curve of human TTR over a range of\n0.03\u20132.00 lg\/mL. Samples were run as single deter-\nminations at 1\/400 dilution and the detection limit\nfor the assay was 12.8 mg\/L (human TTR equiva-\nlents). IL-6 serum concentrations were determined\nby a porcine IL-6 ELISA from R&D Systems (Duoset\nDY686).

RESULTS\n3.1. Gene expression\nGene expression in liver tissue of CRP, FIB,\nHp, IL-6, PigMAP, and SAA2 were signi\ufb01cantly\n(p < 0.05) higher within the infected group\n(n = 10). Whereas gene expression of AGP,\nALB, APOA1, TTR, and, TF were found to be\nsigni\ufb01cantly down-regulated (p < 0.05). Further-\nmore, qRT-PCR was used to quantitate the extra-\nhepatic expression of several APP in the\nfollowing tissues: tracheobronchial lymph nodes,\nspleen, tonsils, and leukocytes (Tab. II andFig. 1).\nmRNA coding for ALB, APOA1, CRP, Hp, Pig-\nMAP, SAA2, TF, TTR and IL-6 was detected in\nall tissues investigated. Expression of AGP was\nfound in all tissues but tonsil, while expression\nof FIBwas only found in tracheobronchial lymph\nnodes, spleen, and liver. CRP, Hp, SAA2, and\nIL-6 were up-regulated (p < 0.05) in leukocytes\nand tracheobronchial lymph nodes of the infected\npigs. In the spleen PigMAP, FIB, SAA2, Hp, and\nIL-6 were signi\ufb01cantly up-regulated in the\ninfected animals while TF and APOA1 were\nsigni\ufb01cantly down-regulated. In the tonsils\nIL-6, PigMAP, and SAA2 were up-regulated\n(p < 0.05) in the infected group (Tab. II). The\nbiological variation in the infected group was\nnot correlated to the exact time of death within\nthe 4 h interval used for sacri\ufb01ce.\nExpression level differences of CRP, Hp,\nSAA2, and IL-6 between liver, leukocytes,\nDisseminated acute phase protein response Vet.

Expression levels for each gene\nproduct measured in each tissue was compared\nto leukocyte expression, set to 1, as shown in\nFigure 1 to visualize tissue speci\ufb01c gene expres-\nsion. As seen (Fig. 1) all APP were highly\nexpressed in the liver. Furthermore, SAA2 was\nexpressed at a signi\ufb01cantly higher level in ton-\nsils and in regional lymph nodes compared to\nleukocytes (p = 0.001). Hp was expressed at a\nsigni\ufb01cantly higher level in the lymph nodes\nand liver compared to leukocytes, and at a\nsigni\ufb01cantly lower level in spleen and tonsil\ncompared to leukocytes (Fig. 1). CRP was\nexpressed at a signi\ufb01cantly higher level in liver\nand lymph nodes compared to leukocytes\n(Fig. 1). CRP expression levels from the spleen\nand tonsils were not included in Figure 1 as only\n\ufb01ve of the ten infected animals expressed CRP\n(see Tab. II). Expression of PigMAP was found\nto be at a signi\ufb01cantly higher level in spleen\n(\u00b7 10), in lymph nodes (\u00b7 62) and in\nliver (\u00b7 1000) compared to leukocytes. To\ndemonstrate that the Wilcoxon rank sum test\nwas robust with regards to the low number of\nanimals, the statistical power was estimated for\na subsample of APP expressed in the liver. Sta-\ntistical power was found to be 1 for 6 out of 8\nAPP tested, as no overlap was present between\ndata for healthy and infected tissue, and 0.75\nand 0.80, respectively, for the last two, indicat-\ning that the number of biological replicates used\nin the present study was suf\ufb01cient due to relative\nlow variation within the two groups.\n3.2. Protein concentrations in serum\nSerum protein analyses were performed on\nsamples from all 12 inoculated pigs and two pigs\nfrom the control group (Fig. 2). Prior to inocula-\ntion all pigs had CRP-values below 6 lg\/mL\n(mean (n = 14): 1.13 lg\/mL, SD: 1.57) while\n14\u201318 h after infection CRP concentrations were\nsigni\ufb01cantly increased in all animals of the inoc-\nulated group (14.8 lg\/mL, SD: 5.38 (n = 11)),\nwith the exception of animal No. 29, the CRP\nconcentration of which (2.79 lg\/mL) was not\nstatistically different from the pre-inoculation\nmean concentration. The same general pattern\nwas seen with SAA, except that one pre-inoc-\nulation control showed a slightly raised value\n(12.10 lg\/mL, pig No. 32); apart from that,\nall the pre-inoculation values were below the\ndetection limit of the assay (2.5 lg\/mL). The\nmean post-inoculation level was 224.48 lg\/mL\n(SD: 48.75, n = 11).\nAlso, for SAA,post-inoculation values of both\npigs 29 and 35 were lower than for the rest of the\ninfected animals, however pig No. 29was clearly\nthe lowest (below the detection limit) and the only\nTable II.

As expected, the hepatic\nexpression of a number of genes known to be\ninvolved in the acute phase protein response\nwas dramatically affected by the infection.\nUp-regulated hepatic expression was seen for\ngenes encoding CRP, FIB, Hp, PigMAP, SAA2,\nand IL-6, whereas genes forAGP,ALB,APOA1,\nTTR, and TF were down-regulated. This is in\nagreement with previous \ufb01ndings using cDNA\nmicroarrays [16] where hepatic expression of\nCRP, FIB, SAA, Hp, ALB, APOA1 and TTR\nwas demonstrated after infection with A.\npleuropneumoniae.\nThe hepatic response was accompanied\nby expression in tonsillar, splenic, and\ntracheobronchial lymphatic tissue as well as\nin leukocytes of ALB, APOA1, CRP, Hp,\nPigMAP, SAA2, TF, TTR, and IL-6. Extrahe-\npatic production of ALB, APOA1, SAA, Hp,\nand PigMAP has previously been described in\npigs [12, 32, 36, 40]. However, the current\nstudy provides to our knowledge the \ufb01rst exam-\nple of extrahepatic expression of AGP, CRP,\nFIB, Hp, PigMAP, TF, and TTR in porcine\nperipheral lymphoid tissues. This \ufb01rmly estab-\nlishes that the APP response is not con\ufb01ned\nto the liver but is widely disseminated. Induc-\ntion patterns were tissue speci\ufb01c with the spleen\nbeing most similar to the liver (Tab. II).\nAs seen inTable II, CRP,Hp, PigMAP, SAA2,\nand IL-6 were signi\ufb01cantly induced after infec-\ntion in most of the tissues with the tonsils being\nthe least responsive tissue. TF,TTR, andAPOA1,\nall negative APP, were decreased in a more\nrestricted number of tissues. Notably, APOA1\nand TFwere signi\ufb01cantly decreased in the spleen\nafter infection.

Skovgaard et al.\nPage 8 of 12 (page number not for citation purpose)\nregulation of a range ofAPP, especially SAA, has\nbeen documented in a number of species. For\nexample, in a study of mice challenged systemi-\ncally by intraperitoneal injection of bacterial\nendotoxin, acute phase response expression pat-\nterns of several APP, including SAA, ceruloplas-\nmin, AGP, and Hp were reported for kidney,\nspleen, thymus, heart, brain, lung, and testis\n[23]. However, the present study demonstrates\nexpression as well as signi\ufb01cant extrahepatic\nup- or down-regulation of APOA1, CRP, Hp,\nFIB, PigMAP, SAA2, and TF in infected pigs\ncompared to non-infected controls. Also, this is\nthe \ufb01rst description of porcine TF being down-\nregulated in the liver after infection, indicating\nthat it may be classi\ufb01ed as a negative APP in\nthe pig. This is in agreement with Kramer et al.\n[24], who found TF to be decreased in serum\nsamples from pigs infected with Salmonella.\nPorcine SAA2 was expressed in tracheo-\nbronchial lymph, tonsils, leukocytes, and spleen\nat levels ranging from 0.01% to 1% of that\nfound in the liver (Fig. 1). This was comparable\nto the \ufb01ndings of Meek and Benditt [35] where\nvarious SAA isotypes were expressed in 15 dif-\nferent extrahepatic tissues at 0.1% to 10% of the\nlevels found in the liver of mice. Also in non-\nhepatic tissues, SAA2 was subject to a dramatic\nacute phase regulation (Tab. II). Hp has previ-\nously been demonstrated in intestinal lymph\nnodes of pigs [44], in lung tissue from pigs suf-\nfering from bronchopneumonia using immuno-\nhistochemistry [19] and different levels of\nmRNA coding for Hp have been found in lung\nand other tissues of mice and baboon [23, 48].\nHowever, the highly regulated expression of\nnon-hepatic Hp after infection has not been\nshown in peripheral lymphoid tissue of pigs\nbefore. The same is true for TTR [4, 22], FIB\n[15, 38], AGP [23, 29], PigMAP [9] and CRP\n[26], the expression of which has been demon-\nstrated in various non-hepatic tissues in differ-\nent species but has never been described in\npigs during an acute phase response.\nAPOA1 and ALB have recently been des-\ncribed in skeletal muscle tissue of newborn pigs\nsuffering from intrauterine growth restriction\n(approximately 30% decrease in APOA1 protein,\n[47]) as well as in mandibular lymph nodes in\nwild boars (Sus scrofa) naturally infected with\nMycobacterium bovis (APOA1 approximately\n40% decreased at the protein level, [36]).

[36] foundmRNA levels of APOA1 to\nbe up-regulated in the same infected pigs, sug-\ngesting a large extent of post-transcriptional regu-\nlation. We show here that mRNA levels of\nAPOA1 were signi\ufb01cantly down-regulated in\nthe spleen and liver of infected animals (Tab. II).\nExtrahepatic APP are most probably pro-\nduced by local resident tissue cells, as several\nAPP were expressed at a signi\ufb01cantly different\nlevel in the various tissues compared to leuko-\ncytes (Fig. 1), see e.g. FIB which was not\nexpressed in leukocytes but induced four fold\nin the spleen after infection (Tab. II), and by\nPigMAP which was expressed in spleen, lymph\nnodes, and in liver 10 times, 62 times, and\n1 000 times more, respectively, compared to\nthe level of expression in leukocytes. This\nmeans that the observed tissue patterns are\nre\ufb02ecting the speci\ufb01c expression of the tissue\nin question, not biased by in\ufb02ux of other cell\ntypes as e.g. blood leukocytes.\nSerum protein concentrations of three positive\nand one negative APP as well as IL-6 were also\ndetermined in two controls and all 12 inoculated\npigs.Twoproteins previously shown tobe rapidly\nreacting APP (CRP and SAA) and two more\nslowly reacting APP (Hp and TTR) [3, 6, 17,\n21] were compared before and after the infection.\nIn general, infections with A. pleuropneumoniae\ninduce an immediate IL-6 response of short dura-\ntion followed by SAA, CRP and then Hp\nresponses [21, 28].We foundprominent increases\nin serum protein concentrations of IL-6, SAA,\nand CRP after infection, while Hp and TTR con-\ncentrationswere not affectedwithin the time span\nof the present study (14\u201318 h).\nComparing individual animals, correlation\nbetween serum IL-6 concentrations, IL-6 leuko-\ncyte mRNA levels (qRT-PCR), and SAA and\nCRP serum concentrations could be seen with\nsome additional correlation to the LLS except\nfor pig 25 (Tab. III and Fig. 2). Notably, the\nzero-pathology animals (Nos. 29 and 35) in\nwhich the inoculation strain was only re-iso-\nlated from the tonsils also showed zero or low\nIL-6 (protein and mRNA) and SAA (protein)\nresponses. This was con\ufb01rmed by the Spearman\nrank test showing correlation between both\nSAA, CRP and IL-6 and lung lesion score.\nIn conclusion, the data presented here show\nfor the \ufb01rst time that extrahepatic expression\nof APP is occurring widely in peripheral lym-\nphoid tissues and cells including leukocytes,\ntonsils, spleen and tracheobronchial lymph\nnodes and, importantly, that their synthesis is\ndramatically altered as a part of the systemic\nacute phase response within 14\u201318 h after\nexperimental lung infection with A. pleuropneu-\nmoniae concurrently with the hepatic response.\nAs we clearly \ufb01nd non-hepatic responses (e.g.\nup regulation of SAA2, CRP, FIB, and Pig-\nMAP) in animals where the pathogen was not\nfound outside tonsils and lung (animals Nos.\n26, 27 and 33, data not shown) acute phase\ninduced host factors might be involved in trig-\ngering this disseminated response. Although\nthe liver do harbor cells capable of producing\npro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines including IL-6 [37,\n41] as also shown in the present study the cur-\nrently preferred model for the hepatic APP\nresponse precisely incorporates the induction\nof hepatic APP by blood-borne circulating host\nfactors [5]. It is quite plausible that such circulat-\ning APP-inducing factors could also affect non-\nhepatic tissues within the time frame of the\nhepatic acute phase response. This, however,\ndoes not explain the role of local IL-6 produc-\ntion as found in all tissues in the present study.\nThe present results support the concept that\nextrahepatically synthesized APP might play\nimportant, yet so far unrecognized roles in the\ninnate defence response to infection, and that\nmany different cell types in the organism have\nthe potential to be induced to produce APP,\nbeing a more generalized disseminated\nsystemic phenomenon that previously thought.\nThe production of pro-in\ufb02ammatory mediators\nand APP in several different peripheral lym-\nphoid tissues of the organism as an early\/imme-\ndiate response would suggest that these\nreactions are bene\ufb01cial to the host even in\nnon-systemic infections. Work is in progress\nto analyse transcriptional responses at different\nlocations of the infected lung. It will be very\ninteresting to elucidate the nature and the mag-\nnitude of cytokine and APP responses in such\ndirectly affected organs compared to the APP\nresponse of peripheral types of tissue described\nin the present paper.\nVet.
