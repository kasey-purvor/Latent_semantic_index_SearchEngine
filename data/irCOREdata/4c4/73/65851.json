Introduction\n[2] In a channel of known slope and shape, the partitioning\nof discharge between depth, velocity, and width depends on\nthe balance between the downslope component of water\nweight and the frictional resistance of the bed. Quantifying\nflow resistance is therefore important in flood estimation,\necological habitat prediction, engineering design, geomor-\nphological regime theory, sediment routingmodels, and other\nscientific and practical applications. What is usually needed\nis a way to predict resistance from readily observable and\ntime-invariant channel properties. In large low-gradient\nrivers, this can be done tolerably well using sand bed\nform geometry or gravel grain size. But a recent review\nconcluded that [Wohl, 2000, p. 82], \u2018\u2018. . .there is not at\npresent a well-tested, consistently accurate equation for\ncalculating the resistance coefficients of mountain rivers.\u2019\u2019\nThis reflects differences in the physical sources of resis-\ntance in flows with different relative submergence of the\nbed (d\/k, where d is the mean flow depth and k is a\nrepresentative bed roughness height). At high submergence\n(say d\/k \u0001102), the main source of resistance is skin\nfriction (form drag on individual particles and viscous\nfriction on their surfaces), plus any large-scale form\nresistance of dunes, bars, or bends. At low submergence\n(say d\/k <10, and more particularly d\/k \u00011), which is\ncharacteristic not just of boulder torrents but also small\ngravel bed streams at low discharge, form drag associated\nwith the turbulent wakes of large roughness elements\nbecomes relatively greater, and there is also spill loss if flow\nis locally supercritical and wave drag on any elements\nprotruding above the water surface. Several authors have\nproposed resistance equations specifically for shallow flows\n[e.g., Bathurst, 1978, 1985, 2002; Jarrett, 1984; Rickenmann,\n1991; Katul et al., 2002; Smart et al., 2002], but with the\nexception of Smart et al. [2002], none was intended to work\nalso for deeper flows, and if extrapolated to such conditions,\nthe predicted resistance is usually far too low or high.\n[3] This paper examines published empirical relations\nand conceptual models as a basis for suggesting generalized\npredictive equations for flow resistance or velocity over a\nwide range of conditions in streams with beds dominated by\ngravel, cobbles, or boulders. It does not address sand-bed\nrivers or the effects of submerged vegetation and large\nwoody debris, but does cover step-pool channels. It is\nwritten in the same spirit as the attempts by Lawrence\n[1997] and Katul et al. [2002] to establish connections\nbetween roughness formulations across traditionally distinct\nboundary layer types. I propose two new approaches and\ncompare them with existing approaches in terms of ability\nto predict measured velocities in natural streams.\n2. Definition and Calculation of Flow Resistance\n[4] Flow resistance is defined and quantified by coeffi-\ncients in equations which relate cross-sectional average\nvelocity (V ) to mean flow depth (d ) and gradient (S = sin q)\non the assumption that frictional retardation of flow is equal\nand opposite to the downslope component of water weight.\nThe three classic equations are\nV \u00bc C\u00f0dS\u00de1=2 \u00bc \u00f08gdS=f \u00de1=2 \u00bc d2=3S1=2=n \u00f01\u00de\n1Department of Geography, Durham University, Durham, UK.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0043-1397\/07\/2006WR005422$09.00\nW05427\nWATER RESOURCES RESEARCH, VOL. 43, W05427, doi:10.1029\/2006WR005422, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1 of 12\nwhere g is the gravitational acceleration andC, f, and n are the\nChe\u00b4zy coefficient, Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, and\nManning\u2019s n, respectively. These are interchangeable via\nequation (1), but f has two advantages. It is nondimensional\nand is physically interpretable as a drag coefficient if\nresistance is equated with gravitational driving force per unit\nbed area and assumed proportional to the square of velocity:\nt0 \u00bc ru2* \u00bc rgdS \u00bc rV 2f =8 \u00f02\u00de\nwhere u\n*\nis the shear velocity. Equations (1) and (2) imply\nthat\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \u00bc V=u* \u00f03\u00de\nand resistance is quantified in this inverse way hereafter.\nBjerklie et al. [2005] proposed V \/ d2\/3S1\/3 as an alternative\nto the Manning equation for slope-area discharge estimation\nand showed that it provided a good fit to a wide range of\nmeasurements; the calibrated constant in this equation is\neffectively a universal resistance coefficient. Other alter-\nnatives proposed specifically for steep shallow streams are\ndiscussed later.\n[5] Accurate determination of f, C, or n at a site\ninvolves measuring V, d, and S as precisely as possible\nthen substituting their values in equation (1). If flow is not\nuniform, S should be the energy slope, incorporating a term\nDV 2\/2g to account for change in velocity head. For narrow\nchannels with rough banks, the mean depth is usually\nreplaced by the hydraulic radius R = A\/P, where A = wd is\nthe cross-section area, w is the wetted width, and P is the\nwetted perimeter. Calculated resistance values apply to the\ndischarge at the time andmay alter at higher or lower stage, so\nfor predictive purposes, f (or C or n) has to be estimated from\nmeasurable and invariant properties of the river channel.\nEquation (1) can then be used to estimate velocity and\ndischarge or (with Q = wdV) to estimate water depth for\nspecified discharge and slope and thus predict water level and\nmean bed shear stress.\n3. Approaches to Estimating Flow Resistance\n[6] In deep uniform gravel bed rivers without submerged\nvegetation, the dominant source of resistance is skin fric-\ntion. Ideally this should be characterized by statistics of the\nbed microtopography since the same grain size distribution\ncan offer greater or lesser resistance to flow depending on\ngrain packing [e.g., Gomez, 1993]. Smart et al. [2002] and\nAberle and Smart [2003] reported promising results using\nthe standard deviation sz of bed elevation in a digital\nelevation model or dense long profile, but this is seldom\nmeasured. Normally all that is available is a grain size\ndistribution, from which k can be equated with or scaled on\na representative diameter D. I therefore focus on this\napproach but discuss later the limitations of D as a measure\nof roughness. D is variously defined as D50 (the median),\nD84 (the size such that 84% is finer), or D90.\n[7] There are two standard ways to estimate flow resis-\ntance from grain size. The first, attributed to Strickler,\nrelates Manning\u2019s n to the 1\/6 power of D. This implies\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \u00bc a1\u00f0d=D\u00de1=6 \u00f04\u00de\nThe constant a1 is generally quoted as 6.7 if D50 is used as\nroughness scale, or 8.2 using D84 or D90, but Parker [1991]\nproposed (8\/f)1\/2 = 8.1(d\/2D84)\n1\/6 which effectively reduces\na1 to 7.3.\n[8] The other main approach, attributed to Keulegan,\nintegrates the logarithmic law of the wall throughout the\nflow depth to obtain\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \u00bc \u00f01=k\u00deln\u00f0d=ez0\u00de \u00bc \u00f01=k\u00deln\u00f011d=k\u00de \u00f05\u00de\nwhere k \u0006 0.4 is the von Karman constant, e is the root of\nnatural logarithms, z0 is the zero-velocity height, and k =\n30z0 is the Nikuradse roughness height (originally equated\nwith D50). The constant 11 (=30\/e) is for an infinitely wide\nflow and increases slightly for other cross-section shapes\n[Hey, 1979]; most authors use 12.2 which Keulegan fitted to\ndata from a trapezoidal flume.\n[9] For shallow flows, neither Manning-Strickler nor\nKeulegan works well in its original form, but several\nmodifications and alternatives have been proposed. Jarrett\n[1984] suggested that n is estimated better from S and R\nthan from D. His best fit equation for n is equivalent to\npredicting velocity as\nV \u00bc 3:10R0:83S 0:12 \u00f06\u00de\nin SI units. High slope acts here as a surrogate for coarse\nbed material. Three other approaches retain D as a predictor:\nmodified log laws, generalized power laws and nondimen-\nsional hydraulic geometry, and roughness-layer models\nbased on a mixing-layer analogy or the concept of form-\ninduced stress. I discuss these in turn, then generalize the\nnondimensional hydraulic geometry approach and suggest a\nnew empirical approach using a variable-power equation.\n3.1. Modified Logarithmic Laws\n[10] Setting k = D50 in the Keulegan equation gives a\nlower bound to resistance in gravel bed rivers and nearly\nalways overestimates measured velocity [Millar, 1999]. The\ngeneral trend of measurements is fitted better by setting k to\nsome multiple of D84 to allow for small-scale form drag on\nprotruding clasts. Suggested values of k\/D84 range from 2.2\nto 3.5 [Thompson and Campbell, 1979; Bray, 1979; Hey,\n1979; Bathurst, 1985].\n[11] Velocity profiles in shallow flows deviate consider-\nably from logarithmic, often having an inflection near the\ntops of the roughness elements [Wiberg and Smith, 1991],\nbut several authors have shown that logarithmic resistance\nequations still give adequate predictions. Thompson and\nCampbell [1979] proposed a modified Keulegan equation\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \u00bc 2:5\u00f01\u0007 0:1k=R\u00deln\u00f012R=k\u00de \u00f07\u00de\nwith k = 4.5D50 (=2.37D84 at their field site). The extra term\nallows for drag on large obstacles which partly block the\nflow; it becomes significant at R\/k < 1. Wiberg and Smith\n[1991] calculated the form drag on a distribution of grain\nsizes protruding above a plane bed and showed that while\nthis generated an inflected velocity profile, the bulk flow\nproperties differed little from equation (5) with k\/D84 \u0006 3.\nSmart et al. [2002] and Aberle and Smart [2003] found that\na log law with k scaled on sz gave a good fit to shallow-flow\n2 of 12\nW05427 FERGUSON: FLOW RESISTANCE EQUATIONS FOR GRAVEL- AND BOULDER-BED STREAMS W05427\nmeasurements in flume experiments with fixed or armored\ngravel.\n[12] This strand of the literature shows that despite the\nknown inadequacy of the law of the wall to describe\nvelocity profiles in shallow flows, equations based on it\nwork over a wide range of conditions so long as the\nroughness height is suitably inflated. Logarithmic equations\nare therefore the standard which others have to beat to\nbecome accepted as useful universal resistance laws.\n3.2. Generalized Power Laws and Nondimensional\nHydraulic Geometry\n[13] The Manning-Strickler relation implies a 1\/6 power\nrelation between (8\/f )1\/2 and d\/k. Keulegan-type logarithmic\nequations are also closely approximated by a power law over\nany limited range of d\/k, but with different exponents for\ndifferent ranges: 1\/6 for 10 < d\/k < 100, 1\/2 for 1 < d\/k < 10,\nand 1 for 0.5 < d\/k < 2 [Carson and Kirkby, 1972, p. 222].\nSeveral authors have proposed the generalized power law\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \u00bc a\u00f0d=k\u00deb \u00f08\u00de\nas a resistance equation, but not surprisingly the best fit\nexponent depends on the calibration data. Griffiths [1981]\nobtained 0.29 for gravel bed rivers, while Bathurst [2002]\nobtained 0.55 and 0.93 for shallow streams of gradient\n<0.8% and >0.8%. Smart et al. [2002] presented a model\nfor head losses past roughness elements which implies\nb = 0.5 and showed that it fits rough-bed flume data well.\nFlow measurements in step-pool streams with emergent\nclasts are best fitted by b \u0006 1 [Lee and Ferguson, 2002;\nComiti et al., 2007].\n[14] A power law resistance relation is also implicit in the\ndimensionally consistent hydraulic geometry equation\nV \/ q0:6\u00f0gS\u00de0:2=k0:4 \u00f09\u00de\n(where q is the unit discharge Q\/w) which Rickenmann\n[1991] and Aberle and Smart [2003] suggested for steep\nshallow flows on the basis of loose-bed flume experiments.\nSubstituting q = dVyields V\/u\n*\n\/ d\/k, corresponding to b = 1\nin equation (8). Rickenmann used k = D90, whereas Aberle\nand Smart set k = sz and found that equation (9) fitted their\ndata even better than a log law. Comiti et al. [2007] propose\nthe nondimensional hydraulic geometry equation\nV* \u00bc cqm* \u00f010\u00de\nfor step-pool and cascade reaches. Here V\n*\n= V\/(gD84)\n0.5,\nq\n*\n= q\/(gD84\n3 )0.5 which by definition is highly correlated with\nrelative submergence, and the best fit to a compilation of\nstep-pool measurements is with m = 0.66. This is a\ngeneralized form of equation (9) without the slope term.\nComiti et al. explored the possible additional influence of\nslope but found no clear effect.\n[15] Whereas equation (10) omits the slope term from\nequation (9), other authors have proposed resistance laws\nthat are analogous to equation (9) without the roughness\nheight term. Jarrett\u2019s [1984] equation for n in terms of R\nand S implies V \/ q0.45S 0.07, and Bjerklie et al.\u2019s [2005]\nmodified Manning equation is equivalent to V \/ q0.4S 0.2.\n3.3. The Roughness Layer\n[16] A third strand in the recent literature considers the\nsources of resistance in shallow flows and what they imply\nfor spatially averaged velocity profiles and bulk flow\nresistance. The vertical velocity profile over a rough bed\nis usually considered to consist of a thin laminar sublayer, a\nturbulent boundary layer with logarithmic profile, and an\nouter layer which deviates slightly from logarithmic. In\nshallow flows, the outer layer is absent and the near-bed\nprofile deviates from logarithmic within a roughness layer\nthat extends above the tops of the roughness elements. For\nd\/k below \u00014, the roughness elements affect all levels in the\nflow, so there is no boundary layer in the conventional\nsense. Lawrence [1997, 2000] proposed a mixing-length\nmodel for flow resistance in overland flow over stony soil,\nand Katul et al. [2002] suggested that a shallow stream is\nanalogous to the mixing layer within airflow through\nvegetation or overbank streamflow on vegetated flood-\nplains. In these situations, the flow penetrates a porous\narray of roughness elements, with reduced mean velocity\nbecause of turbulent eddies generated in and below the shear\nlayer at the top of the canopy or roughness elements. In a\ncomplementary approach, Gimenez-Curto and Corniero\nLera [1996, 2006] and Nikora et al. [2001, 2004] noted that\ndouble (space as well as time) Reynolds averaging of the\nNavier-Stokes equations over an irregular bed introduces\nspatial covariance terms which increase bulk flow resistance.\nThese terms represent form drag on roughness elements and\nform-induced stress due to vorticity generated by flow\nseparation from roughness elements. Gimenez-Curto and\nCorniero Lera [1996] proposed that form-induced stress\ndominates the bulk resistance in such situations, in what they\ntermed a \u2018\u2018jet regime\u2019\u2019 as distinct from the rough turbulent\nregime with a boundary layer above an essentially planar bed.\n[17] Although these authors started from different heuris-\ntic models, they mostly reached the same conclusion about\nbulk flow resistance in a roughness layer. For partial\ninundation (d\/k < 1), Lawrence [1997] and Nikora et al.\n[2001] proposed that resistance consists mainly of form\ndrag on roughness elements so that f \/ d and V\/u\n*\nincreases\nas the flow becomes even shallower. Lawrence [2000]\nsubsequently found experimentally that f is near constant\nfor d < k and is much higher than predicted by form-drag\nmodels, perhaps because of additional resistance from free\nsurface deformation and wake interference. Nikora et al.\n[2004] noted that several alternative velocity profiles can be\njustified heuristically. For d\/k from 1 to \u00014, Lawrence\n[1997, 2000], Gimenez-Curto and Corniero Lera [1996,\n2006], and Nikora et al. [2001] all assumed a mixing length\nthat scales with k. This implies a linear resistance relation\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \/ d=k \u00f011\u00de\nThe papers of Rickenmann [1991], Lawrence [1997],\nNikora et al. [2001], Aberle and Smart [2003], and\nGimenez-Curto and Corniero [2006] imply a proportion-\nality constant of \u00011 to \u00014 in equation (11) depending on\nthe assumptions made about obstacle shape, how k is\ndefined in terms of measurable bed properties, and whether\nthe height of the mixing layer is equated with k or some\nmultiple of it.\nW05427 FERGUSON: FLOW RESISTANCE EQUATIONS FOR GRAVEL- AND BOULDER-BED STREAMS\n3 of 12\nW05427\n[18] Katul et al. [2002] suggested that a mean velocity\nprofile with an inflection at the top of a mixing layer can be\nrepresented by a hyperbolic tangent function. If the thick-\nness of the mixing layer is equated with k, integration of the\nprofile function gives the flow resistance as\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \/ f1\u00fe \u00f0k=d\u00deln\u00bd0:65cosh\u00f0d=k \u0007 1\u00de\u000bg \u00f012\u00de\nThis approach assumes that the length scale of vorticity in\nthe mixing layer is of the same order as the flow depth and\nobstacle height, but equation (12) was considered applicable\nthroughout the range 0.2 < d\/k < 7. At d\/k \u0006 1, it is almost\nas steep as equation (11), but the resistance is asymptoti-\ncally constant if the equation is extrapolated beyond its\nintended range to very low or very high d\/k.\n4. Synthesis and New Resistance Equations\n4.1. Generalized Nondimensional Hydraulic Geometry\n[19] The approaches of Aberle and Smart [2003] and\nComiti et al. [2007] can be integrated with each other and\nwith much previous literature on flow resistance by starting\nfrom the general power law equation (8) and setting k = D:\n\u00f08=f \u00de0:5 \u00bc V=u* \u00bc a\u00f0d=D\u00de\nb \u00f013\u00de\nWriting d = q\/V and rearranging yields the nondimensional\nhydraulic geometry relation\nV* \u00bc a1\u0007mS\u00f01\u0007m\u00de=2qm* \u00f014\u00de\nin which V\n*\nand q\n*\nare defined as in (10) and the exponents b\nand m are related by m = (2b + 1)\/(2b + 3) and b = (3m \u0007 1)\/\n2(1 \u0007 m). This predicts velocity for known slope, grain size,\nand unit discharge; depth follows immediately and shear\nstress can then be estimated from depth \r slope. This\nequivalence between power law resistance and nondimen-\nsional hydraulic geometry doubtlessly has been worked out\nby previous researchers, but I cannot find it in print. Aberle\nand Smart [2003] proposed an equation for V as a product of\npowers of g, S, q, and D and noted that for dimensional\nhomogeneity the exponents of g and D are determined by\nthat of q; equation (14) suggests the slope exponent is\nalso constrained. The particular equations proposed by\nRickenmann [1991] and Aberle and Smart [2003] involve\nq0.6 which is consistent with m = 0.6 in equation (14) and\nb = 1 in the power law resistance equation (13); that is, they\nare equivalent to the roughness-layer resistance relation (11).\n[20] Evidently several different heuristic and empirical\nanalyses of shallow flows all converge on (8\/f )1\/2 \/ d\/D,\nsuggesting that this can be adopted as a default model for\nshallow flows without having to justify any particular\ninterpretation of the dominant physical processes. This\nroughness-layer (RL) relation can be regarded as one end-\nmember of a range of possible power law resistance\nfunctions for different conditions. The other end-member,\nfor relatively deep rivers with lower slopes, is the Manning-\nStrickler (MS) friction law [equation (4), or b = 1\/6 in\nequation (13)] which corresponds in equation (14) to m =\n0.4 and a slope exponent of 0.3. Thus as attention moves\nfrom steep shallow streams to deeper rivers, the exponent of\ndischarge in equation (14) decreases and that of slope\nincreases.\n[21] The neatest way to synthesize the MS and RL end-\nmembers is through a variable-power resistance equation,\nwhich I develop below, but a first approximation is simply\nto use MS for \u2018\u2018deep\u2019\u2019 flows and RL for \u2018\u2018shallow\u2019\u2019 flows,\nwith \u2018\u2018deep\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018shallow\u2019\u2019 defined by cutpoints of d\/D or\nq\n*\n. This MS\/RL approach has two variants: predict f and V\/\nu* from d\/D using equation (13) with b = 1\/6 for deep flows\nbut 1 for shallow flows, or predict V directly from q, S, and\nD using equation (14) with m = 0.4 for deep flows but 0.6\nfor shallow flows. It would be possible to use a threefold\ndivision with b = 1\/6, 1\/2, 1 or m = 0.4, 0.5, 0.6. Using a\nsimple two-way cut, the prediction equations using relative\nsubmergence are\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \u00bc V=u* \u00bc a1\u00f0d=D\u00de\n1=6 \u00f0deep flows\u00de \u00f015a\u00de\n\u00bc a2d=D \u00f0shallow flows\u00de \u00f015b\u00de\nwhere the previously cited literature suggests a1 \u0006 7\u20138 and\na2 \u0006 1\u20134. In the second variant, velocity is predicted using\nV* \u00bc a0:61 q0:4* S0:3 \u00f0deep flows\u00de \u00f016a\u00de\n\u00bc a0:42 q0:6* S0:2 \u00f0shallow flows\u00de \u00f016b\u00de\nwith V\n*\n, q\n*\n, a1, and a2 as previously defined. In testing this\nMS\/RL approach below, I use D = D84, R rather than d, and\ndefine \u2018\u2018shallow\u2019\u2019 flows in equation (15) as R\/D84 < 4 based\non the previously cited literature. The equivalent cutpoint\nfor equation (16) is taken as q\n*\n= 2 based on the strong\n(since partly spurious) correlation between q\n*\nand R\/D84 in\nthe data set used below.\n4.2. A Variable-Power Equation\n[22] The alternative synthesis is a function that is asymp-\ntotic to the MS and RL equations as d\/D becomes very large\nor very small, respectively. This approach does not appear\nto have been considered previously. It treats the Darcy-\nWeisbach friction factor f as a sum of two components, as\ndone when combining skin friction and bed form effects\n[e.g., Yalin, 1992, pp. 13\u201314]. The Manning-Strickler\nequation (4) implies\nf =8 \u00bc \u00f0D=d\u00de1=3=a21 \u00f017\u00de\nand the roughness-layer relation (11) implies\nf =8 \u00bc \u00f0D=d\u00de2=a22 \u00f018\u00de\nBoth components are present in coarse-bedded streams but\nin varying proportions. Adding them gives\nf =8 \u00bc \u00f0D=d\u00de2=a22 \u00fe \u00f0D=d\u00de1=3=a21\n\u00bc \u00f0D=d\u00de2\u00bda21 \u00fe a22\u00f0d=D\u00de5=3\u000b=a21a22 \u00f019\u00de\nand therefore\n\u00f08=f \u00de1=2 \u00bc a1a2\u00f0d=D\u00de=\u00bda21 \u00fe a22\u00f0d=D\u00de5=3\u000b1=2 \u00f020\u00de\n4 of 12\nW05427 FERGUSON: FLOW RESISTANCE EQUATIONS FOR GRAVEL- AND BOULDER-BED STREAMS W05427\nThis plots as a smooth curve, asymptotic to a 1\/6 power\nrelation at d\/D \u000e 1 (when the a12 term in the denominator\nbecomes negligible) but to a linear relation at d\/D < 1 (when\nthe second term in the denominator becomes negligible; it is\nthe smaller term even at d\/D = 1 since a1 > a2). This variable-\npower equation (VPE hereafter) provides a single resistance\nequation applicable to both shallow and deep flows over\ncoarse river beds. It quantifies the concept that the dominant\nsources of resistance alter as flow becomes shallower, and\navoids forcing a logarithmic resistance law on circumstances\nin which velocity profiles are far from logarithmic. A\npossible physical rationale is discussed below.\n5. Comparison With Field Data\n[23] The potential value of the two-part MS\/RL equation in\nits variants (15) and (16), and the variable-power equation\n(20), can be assessed by testing how well they and existing\nequations predict measured mean velocity. Velocity, rather\nthan f or (8\/f )1\/2, is chosen as the variable to be predicted\nbecause f itself is not normally of interest when resistance\nequations are used for scientific or practical applications.\n5.1. Selection of Data and Range of Conditions\n[24] Data on velocity and the variables needed to predict it\nwere compiled from the sources listed in Table 1. Criteria for\ninclusion of a data set were that (1) it refers to near-straight\nreaches of natural streams with gravel\/cobble or cobble\/\nboulder beds and no bedrock or woody debris; (2) field\nmethods are clearly described or could be ascertained by\nasking the authors and appear robust; (3) depth and velocity\nare averaged over several cross sections; (4) pebble-count\nestimates ofD84 are listed; (5) hydraulic radius is either listed\nor calculable as A\/(w + d) which is a close approximation for\ntrapezoidal sections with bank angles of\u000145\u0001; and (6) either\nenergy slopes are listed, or it is clear that flow is sufficiently\nclose to uniform that listed water surface slopes are a close\napproximation to energy slopes. The use ofD84 as roughness\nheight, and hydraulic radius rather than mean depth, reflects\ndominant practice and therefore data availability. The data\ninclude at-a-site changes in velocity as well as between-site\ncomparisons. A versatile resistance formulation should be\nable to predict both, although Bathurst [1985, 2002] found a\ntendency for V\/u* to increase faster with R\/D at sites than\nbetween sites.\n[25] The first six data sets in Table 1 were obtained by\nsurveying several cross sections in a straight reach to obtain\nmean width and depth, surveying slope over a substantial\ndistance (usually >20 widths), measuring Q by current meter\nor from the rating curve for an adjacent gauging station, and\nsubsequently deriving V and f. Jarrett [1984] and Hicks and\nMason [1991] listed true energy slopes allowing for nonuni-\nform flow, Bathurst [1978, 1985] stated that his listed water\nsurface slopes are within 5% of the energy slope, and the\nother authors stated that their reaches were nearly uniform.\nThe threemost recent data sets are for small step-pool streams\nin which Q was measured by gauging structure or salt\ndilution, reach-average velocity was measured by salt-wave\ntraveltime, S was surveyed over the same distance, and a\nreach-average depth was obtained as Q\/wV or by averaging\nmeasurements at several sections. This procedure does not\nyield separate velocity measurements at the start and end of\nthe reach from which to compute DV2\/g, but this correction\nterm cannot be significant in step-pool channels with high\nslope and low or moderate velocity. A few data points are\nomitted: bedrock reaches in MacFarlane and Wohl\u2019s [2003]\ndata set, measurements which Jarrett and Bathurst [1985]\nflagged as overbank flows through dense vegetation, two of\nJarrett\u2019s sites for which D84 is not available, and those of\nHicks and Mason\u2019s sites for which the quoted uncertainty in\nQ exceeds 10%.\n[26] The complete data set (N = 376) spans slopes from\n0.0007 to 0.21,D84 from 0.05 to 0.8 m, relative submergence\nR\/D84 from 0.1 to 26 with one value of 87, and q* from 0.002\nto >100. The median Froude number in the entire data set is\nonly 0.37, but this does not exclude the possibility of local\nhydraulic jumps, and five measurements in flood conditions\nhave a reach-average Froude number in excess of 0.8.\n5.2. Predictive Performance of Alternative Equations:\nVisual Assessment\n[27] Figure 1 shows the correlation between (8\/f )1\/2 and\nrelative submergence for the data as a whole. Figure 1a is a\nlog-log plot which differentiates more clearly in low-sub-\nmergence, high-resistance conditions. The scatter in per-\ncentage terms is perceptibly wider at this end of the plot.\nFigure 1b is the traditional semilog plot on which the log\nlaw plots as a straight line. This hides the large relative, but\nsmall absolute, differences in predictions at very low\nsubmergence, and instead emphasizes differences at higher\nsubmergence. The q* version of the MS\/RL method cannot\nbe shown in these plots, and nor can the equations of Jarrett\n[1984] and Bjerklie et al. [2005], but curves for almost all\nother equations are displayed in Figure 1a and\/or 1b to\nallow comparison between equations and with the data. The\nequations of Rickenmann [1991], Smart et al.

[2002] are plotted using their authors\u2019 recom-\nmended coefficients. The logarithmic equation is plotted\nusing a constant of 12.2 and k\/D84 = 3.5, following Hey\n[1979]. The Manning-Strickler, MS\/RL, and variable-power\nequations are plotted using a1 = 7.5 which is in the middle\nof the range of literature values and a2 = 2.36 which gives\nsmooth matching of the two parts of the MS\/RL relation at\nthe cutpoint R\/D84 = 4. Improvements in fit after calibration\nto the present data are discussed below.\n[28] It can be seen from Figure 1 that the 1\/6 power\nManning-Strickler equation overestimates velocity in all\nconditions, but with recalibration, it could evidently describe\nquite well the trend forR\/D84 > 4.Rickenmann\u2019s [1991] linear\nequation parallels the data in the partial-submergence con-\nditions for which it was intended, but its flume-calibrated\nconstant overestimates velocity in this field data set. The RL\npart of MS\/RL is parallel to Rickenmann\u2019s equation in\nFigure 1a but offset from it because of the different coeffi-\ncient value, as shown by the lower part of the VPE curve.\nBathurst\u2019s [2002] equations are omitted for clarity since they\nplot close to Rickenmann at lower values of R\/D84 and close\nto Manning-Strickler at higher submergence; this confirms\nBathurst\u2019s suggestion that they define a lower limit for\nresistance (an upper envelope in Figure 1a). The flume-\ncalibrated logarithmic equation of Smart et al. [2002] also\nplots close to the upper edge of the shallow-flow data, but\nnearer the middle of the scatter at higher submergence. Katul\net al.\u2019s [2002] equation fits the general trend well in the range\nfor which it was intended, but not when extrapolated to deep\nor very shallow flows.\n[29] The only plotted equations that follow the trend of\nthe data over most or all of the range are the VPE and the\nHey and Thompson-Campbell logarithmic equations. The\nlatter are more sharply curved in Figure 1a, predicting lower\nresistance than the VPE at intermediate submergence but\nvery high resistance at low submergence where the general\ntrend is more nearly tracked by the VPE. The Hey and\nThompson-Campbell relations differ little except at very\nlow R\/D84 where the latter declines slightly less steeply. All\nlogarithmic equations make nonphysical predictions once\nR\/D84 is so low that the logarithm becomes negative.\n[30] In the semilogarithmic plot of Figure 1b, the VPE\nhas an inflection, rather like Katul et al.\u2019s [2002] relation\nbut with asymptotes that are sloping not horizontal. Its\nvisual fit is good despite using uncalibrated values of the\ntwo parameters. The MS\/RL relation converges on the VPE\nat very low or high submergence; it fits shallow flows well\nbut is near the upper edge of the scatter at intermediate\nsubmergence.\n[31] The nondimensional hydraulic geometry variant of\ntheMS\/RL predictor [equation (16)] can only be illustrated in\na plot of V\n*\nagainst q\n*\n(Figure 2). This shows the expected\ncurvature of the data cloud with a perceptibly flatter trend at\nhigher q\n*\n. Predictions of V\n*\ndepend on slope as well as q\n*\n, so\nFigure 2 shows prediction envelopes calculated using the\nlowest and highest slopes in each half of the data set: 0.0007\nand 0.039 for q\n*\n> 2, 0.0015 and 0.21 for q\n*\n< 2. Despite the\nuse of uncalibrated values of a1 and a2, most of the data\npoints do fall within the envelopes, the outliers are on both\nsides suggesting no major bias, and the precise choice of\ncutpoint does not appear to be critical.\n5.3. Predictive Performance of Alternative Equations:\nStatistical Assessment\n[32] The plots of resistance against submergence in\nFigure 1 show the differences between equations that can\nbe plotted in that way, but predictive performance is more\nlogically considered for velocity as the prediction target. This\nFigure 1. (a) Log-log and (b) semilog plots of (8\/f )1\/2 (= V\/u\n*\n) against relative submergence R\/D84\nusing all 376 data points from the sources listed in Table 1.

[2005] which do not use D.\n[33] Predictive performance can be assessed statistically in\nmany ways. The metrics used here are root mean square\n(RMS) error se = [\nP\n(Vp \u0007 Vm)2\/N]1\/2 (where Vp and Vm\ndenote predicted and measured velocity) and RMS logarith-\nmic error slog = [\nP\n(log Vp \u0007 log Vm)2\/N]1\/2. The former\nassesses typical error in m s\u00071 and therefore emphasizes\nerrors in predicting faster (usually deeper) flows, whereas\nslog assesses relative error and therefore gives greater weight\nto overprediction or underprediction of slow (usually shallow)\nflows. I also consider the number of prediction errors that\nexceed a factor of 2 (Vp\/Vm > 2 or < 0.5).\n[34] Table 2 compares the predictive performance of\nselected equations which, according to Figure 1 or the\nliterature, work over a wide range of conditions and describe\nthe central trend of field data rather than a minimum-\nresistance envelope. The equations of Rickenmann [1991],\nBathurst [2002], Smart et al. [2002], and Katul et al. [2002]\nare therefore not considered. The tabulated statistics are for\npublished values of each equation\u2019s parameters without\ncalibration to the present data. Hey\u2019s [1979] coefficient\nvalues are used for the logarithmic equation, except that\nnegative predictions by this and the Thompson-Campbell\nequation at very low R\/D84 are replaced by a small positive\nnumber.\n[35] The best fit equation in terms of se is Jarrett\u2019s, closely\nfollowed by Hey\u2019s and the new VPE and q* relations.\nHowever, Jarrett\u2019s equation has fairly high slog and many\nfactor-of-2 overpredictions; inspection shows that it predicts\nhigh velocities well but overestimates all 71 measured\nvelocities below 0.2 m s\u00071. The modified Manning equation\nof Bjerklie et al. [2005] has the same bias, but more so, and\nthe highest se. In terms of percentage error, the new q*\nequation is by far the best, then VPE and MS\/RL, with the\nlogarithmic equations performing rather poorly.\n[36] Table 3 shows the improvement in predictive ability\nwhen selected equations are calibrated to minimize either se\nor slog. The equations using R and S are not shown because\nthey continue to have higher slog than others and systematic\nbias at low velocities. The Thompson-Campbell equation is\nalso omitted since after calibration, its blockage coefficient\nis almost zero and the equation converges on the simple\nFigure 2.

The percentage error of the latter is\nmuch improved by introducing a minimum velocity predic-\ntion of \u00010.2 m s\u00071 and increasing k\/D84 slightly to \u00014. The\nfits of the three new equations are improved by reducing a1\nto 5\u20136 (MS\/RL and q*) or 6\u20137 (VPE). After these changes,\nthe q* approach emerges as by far the best predictor\nwhichever criterion is used. Of the approaches using relative\nsubmergence, the logarithmic equation has the lowest RMS\nerrors, but VPE and MS\/RL are only marginally inferior and\nthe VPE gives slightly fewer factor-of-2 errors than the\nothers.\n[37] The equation which does best overall in this statistical\ncomparison is thus the q* version of the MS\/RL approach,\nfollowed by two relative-submergence equations: logarith-\nmic with a positive lower limit to predicted velocity and an\ninflated k\/D84 on the lines of Bray [1979] and Hey [1979],\nand the new variable-power equation. The patterns of pre-\ndiction error for these equations are illustrated in Figure 3\nusing round-number parameter values that are near-optimal\nfor both se and slog (Table 2). Each plot has a dense cloud of\ndata points along the 1:1 line, showing good agreement of\neach equation with much of the data, but with some points\nwell off the line. The scatter is visibly less for the q* equation\nthan for the equations using R\/D84, in accordance with the\nvalues of slog in Table 3. Computing se and slog separately for\nthe RL and MS domains in Figure 3c reveals that se is much\nhigher for the MS domain, in which velocities tend to be\nhigher, but slog is slightly higher in the RL domain. Most of\nthe biggest prediction errors in all three plots relate to a single\nsite indicated by a distinctive symbol in Figure 3. This is site\nGB of Lee and Ferguson [2002], which is a very steep (S =\n0.18) and coarse (D84 = 0.78 m, Dmax = 2.7 m) step-pool\nreach in which the nine lowest discharges were a mere trickle\nbetween boulders. Just why all equations fail on this site is\nunclear, but omitting it improves the error statistics of every\nequation, particularly the VPE which now has the same se as\nthe logarithmic equation and an appreciably lower slog. This\ncan be understood by inspecting Figure 1a in which the nine\nlow-flow measurements at site GB form the isolated cluster\nof points with (8\/f )1\/2 < 0.1.

Discussion\n[38] A cautious conclusion to this paper would be that little\nhas changed since Wohl [2000] made her pessimistic assess-\nment of equations for calculating flow resistance in mountain\nrivers. Figure 1 shows that some resistance equations track\nfield data well within a limited range of submergence but are\nnot universal, and others approximately define the minimum-\nresistance envelope of the data, but few follow the central\ntrend in a more or less unbiased way over the full range of\nsubmergence. Moreover, the scatter in the data plots is very\nwide, so even if a resistance equation is approximately\nunbiased, it will be subject to considerable predictive\nuncertainty. In this study, all submergence-based equations\nget the measured velocity wrong by more than a factor of 2\nin at least 15% of cases, although the q*-based approach\nreduces this below 8% for reasons which will be discussed\nlater. Big relative errors are most frequent in conditions of\npartial submergence (R\/D84 < 1) which is common during\nlow flow in steep streams. Prediction errors for faster-\nflowing rivers, or small streams at times of flood, are\nsmaller in relative terms but still frustratingly large in\nabsolute terms.\n[39] Accurate prediction of mean velocity in gravel- and\nboulder-bed streams is difficult for two kinds of reason:\npractical difficulties in measuring the bed and flow proper-\nties used to calibrate or apply resistance equations, and\ntheoretical limitations on how well it is possible to\npredict reach-average velocity using very simple equa-\ntions. Practical problems can in principle be overcome,\nbut the theoretical issues imply that predictions can\nnever be perfect. I consider the practical problems first,\nthen the theoretical limitations of any simple approach,\nand finally suggest implications for practice and future\nresearch.\n6.1. Susceptibility to Measurement Error\n[40] Uncertainties in input data lead to uncertainties in\npredictions no matter how good the resistance equation\nused. The large scatter in Figure 1 may partly reflect\nmeasurement errors in the nondimensional variables on\none or both axes. Calculation of f and d\/D requires values\nof d, D, S, and V and each is subject to error. As noted\nabove, the slope used to calculate f is ideally the energy\nslope; using the water-surface slope or mean bed slope can\nintroduce bias if there is substantial flow nonuniformity\n[Jarrett, 1984; Hicks and Mason, 1991]. This source of\nuncertainty is potentially most serious for fast low-gradient\nflows, i.e., high d\/D. The shortage of data points at\nsubmergences much above 10 in Figure 1 is because\nfew data sets are explicit about uniformity or velocity\nhead.\n[41] Significant measurement errors in variables other\nthan slope are most likely at low d\/D, which is where\nFigure 1 shows greatest scatter. The definitions of flow\ndepth and other geometric variables are obvious in rigid-bed\nflumes but become increasingly fuzzy in steep natural\nchannels. The absolute precision of cross-section surveys\ndecreases with increasing bed grain size (or rather sz), and\ncoarser beds are often associated with shallower flow, so\nthat the relative precision of an estimate of d or R becomes\neven lower. Estimating V and Q from current-meter meas-\nurements is also increasingly unreliable the lower the\nrelative submergence. Most recent studies of step-pool\nchannels have avoided this problem by estimating reach-\naverage mean velocity from salt-wave traveltime between\ntwo sites, and some have estimated reach-average depth as\nd = Q\/wV with w averaged over numerous cross sections,\nbut Lee and Ferguson [2002] showed by error propagation\nanalysis that (8\/f)1\/2 in their step-pool reaches still had an\nuncertainty of \u00b117%. Grain size measurement is also\nmore difficult for boulder beds: The random-pacing\nmethod of pebble counting becomes impossible, the grid\nmethod becomes harder, and grains are too heavy to lift\nfor measurement. In step-pool systems, there is also the\nquestion of whether to use a reach-average grain size or\none for the steps which contribute most of the flow\nresistance. The uncertainty of estimates of D84 in such\nstreams is at least \u00b110% and probably \u00b120%. If one adds\nan uncertainty of at least 10% in d or R, horizontal\nplotting positions in Figure 1 could be out by half a log\ncycle.\n[42] Robustness to measurement error is probably a factor\nin the superior predictive performance of the MS\/RL\napproach using q* [equations (16a) and (16b)] compared\nto the same approach using R\/D84 [equations (15a) and\n(15b)]. In Figure 3c, using q*, any error in D84, Q, or V\naffects both observed and predicted velocity so that the data\npoint moves almost parallel to the 1:1 line. But when\npredictions are made using R\/D84, error in any one input\nvariable affects either predicted or measured velocity, not\nboth, so tends to increase the scatter.\n6.2. Theoretical Limitations\n[43] Even with uniform flow and accurate measurements,\nthe predictive ability of simple flow resistance equations is\nlimited by two key assumptions which can be challenged\non theoretical grounds. One is that total resistance to flow\ncan be parameterized by a small-scale property of the bed,\nsuch as D84; the other is that, for a given bed roughness,\nthere is a unique relation between mean depth and mean\nvelocity.\n[44] The assumption that the roughness height in the log\nlaw can be equated with a grain size percentile goes back to\nNikuradse\u2019s classic experiments with roughened pipes. It is\naccepted as valid for well-sorted sediment without bed\nforms, but few gravel- or boulder-bed rivers are like this.\nGrain size distributions are typically wide, so individual\nlarge clasts can protrude into the flow and groups of them\ncan form clusters, polygons, or steps. Skin resistance is then\nsupplemented by small-scale form drag and possibly also\nspill losses, so that the log law and its 1\/6 power approx-\nimation overpredict velocity unless k\/D84 is increased in the\nformer and a reduced in the latter. Calculations of the\ncombined form drag on clasts of different size protruding\nabove a plane bed [Wiberg and Smith, 1991] give a similar\nk\/D84 ratio to the curve fitting of Bray [1979], Hey [1979],\nand subsequent workers, but as pointed out by Smart et al.\n[2002], k should really be scaled on statistics of bed\nmicrotopography rather than grain size if drag is the main\nsource of resistance. Microtopography is considered explic-\nitly by authors proposing versions of what I have termed the\nroughness-layer equation. Lawrence [2000], Nikora et al.\nW05427 FERGUSON: FLOW RESISTANCE EQUATIONS FOR GRAVEL- AND BOULDER-BED STREAMS\n9 of 12\nW05427\n[2001], and Gimenez-Curto and Corniero [2006] all as-\nsumed that characteristic obstacle height must scale with\ncharacteristic grain size, but the precise scaling depends on\nwhat is assumed about obstacle shape which tends to be far\nmore variable in river beds than in the better-studied case of\nplant stems. It is now possible to measure the microtopog-\nraphy of river beds to high resolution by digital photogram-\nmetry and of exposed parts to even higher resolution by\nlaser scanning, but it remains unclear whether a single\nstatistic like sz can adequately characterize roughness.\nFurthermore, in streams with step-pool or bar-pool-riffle\nmorphology, there are two distinct scales of topographic\nvariability. A grain-size-based roughness length will tend\nto underestimate total flow resistance in such situations,\nthe best choice of topographic roughness length is unclear,\nand a way to use two length scales may need to be\ndevised. Large woody debris adds further resistance which\nis difficult to separate from other sources [Wilcox et al.,\n2006].\n[45] The other problem, about nonuniqueness of the\ndepth-velocity relation, is more subtle and applies whether\nbed roughness is characterized by a grain size or a topo-\ngraphic statistic. It can be understood by considering the\nthree-dimensional spatial variability of velocity within the\ncontrol volume for which a grand mean velocity is to be\npredicted. The first issue is that any universal relation\nbetween local depth d and local vertically averaged velocity\nV is likely to be nonlinear, so substituting the mean of a\nspatially variable depth into it will give a biased estimate of\nthe spatially averaged mean velocity. More fundamentally, it\nis unlikely that any single relation does exist between d and\nV if there is a combination of skin and drag resistance (I am\nindebted to a reviewer for this insight and suggestions about\nhow to develop it). In a Reynolds-averaged formulation of\nuniform flow in a bed-parallel slice at height z, the gravity\ndriving force per unit mass of water is balanced by a\ncombination of turbulent shear and drag on any obstacles\npresent at that height:\ngS \u00bc @u\n0w0\n@z\n\u00fe 0:5CDAjU jU \u00f021\u00de\nwhere U is the time-averaged velocity, u0 is the instantaneous\ndeviation fromU,w0 is the instantaneous vertical velocity, the\noverbar denotes time averaging, A is the frontal area of\nobstacles per unit mass of water, and CD is a drag\ncoefficient. This is a simplified version of equation (1) in\nthe study by Nikora et al. [2004] and is equivalent to\nequation (2) in Poggi et al.\u2019s [2004] paper on turbulence in\nintermediate-density canopy flow. The turbulent shear term\nis most easily related to the mean flow by Prandtl\u2019s\nhypothesis\nu0w0 \u00bc \u0007l2 @U\n@z\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n@U\n@z\n\u00f022\u00de\nwhere l is an eddy mixing length. If the turbulence term in\nequation (21) is small compared to the drag term, the\nvalue of U for a given slope depends only on obstacle\ncharacteristics, but when turbulent shear is significant, the\nsolution for U from equations (21) and (22) depends on l\nas well as A and CD. Mixing length varies with height and\nnot necessarily in a universal way. Poggi et al. [2004]\nproposed that flow above a canopy approximates a\nconventional boundary layer with l proportional to height\nabove the canopy, flow within the canopy is dominated by\nKarman streets with eddy length independent of height, and\nflow near the canopy top is essentially a Kelvin-Helmholtz\nshear layer with l controlled by U and its gradient. For a\ngiven roughness height, any one of these scalings implies a\nparticular time-average vertical velocity profile which\nwhen integrated gives a particular relation between d and\nV. Thus l = kz at all heights implies dV\/dd \/ d\u00071\/2, V \/\nd1\/2, and a constant value of (8\/f )1\/2, whereas l = constant\nimplies dV\/dd \/ d1\/2, V \/ d3\/2, and (8\/f )1\/2 \/ d which is\nthe roughness-layer equation. The 1\/6 power approximation\nof the log law falls between these extremes with V\/ d2\/3 and\nthe log law itself is close to this. A 1\/2 power law [Smart et\nal., 2002] would give a linear velocity profile, and there are\nendless other possibilities. For shallow flows in which there\nare two or more mixing length regimes, as suggested by\nNikora et al. [2004] andPoggi et al. [2004], the vertical velocity\nprofile will be more complicated than is implied by any power\nlaw with a fixed exponent. This suggests that there is some\nphysical basis for the variable-power equation proposed in this\npaper, in which the power used to relate V to d alters according\nto d\/k. Another possible way to deal with this situation is to\ntreat V as a weighted average of the mean velocities in each of\ntwo layers, computed using different relations (Canovaro and\nSolari, poster presented at 6th International Workshop on\nGravel-Bed Rivers, September 2005).\n6.3. Conclusions\n[46] The foregoing discussion has suggested both practical\nand theoretical reasons why simple flow resistance equations\ndo not give precise predictions of mean velocity. There is a\nclear need for further research directed toward identifying\neffective topographic indices of resistance, and for detailed\nflow and turbulence measurements in streams or self-\nformed laboratory channels to help elucidate the physics\nof shallow flows over irregular beds. Yet there will surely\ncontinue to be a role for simple flow resistance equations\nthat can be used for generic calculations or practical\napplications, so it is relevant to ask which equations are\nmost reliable and versatile for predicting resistance and\nvelocity in relatively shallow streams. Some clear and\nmoderately optimistic conclusions can be reached about\nthis.\n[47] The longstanding andwidely used Keulegan approach\nto flow resistance and velocity prediction, based on integrat-\ning the logarithmic law of the wall, predicts velocity at least\nas well as existing alternative equations even in conditions\nwhere a full-depth logarithmic velocity profile is unrealistic.\nThis empirical adequacy is achieved by setting the roughness\nheight k to a substantial multiple of D84 and replacing near-\nzero or negative predictions at very low submergence by a\nsmall positive value. The best fit value of k\/D84 for the\npresent data compilation is \u00014, just a little higher than Hey\u2019s\n[1979] value of 3.5.\n[48] Two new approaches developed in this paper also\npredict velocity fairly well at any relative submergence.\nEach assumes that in very shallow flows (8\/f )1\/2 (or equiv-\nalently V\/u*) increases linearly with relative submergence in\nwhat I term the roughness-layer relation [RL; equation (11)],\nwhereas in deep flows, an approximately logarithmic rela-\n10 of 12\nW05427 FERGUSON: FLOW RESISTANCE EQUATIONS FOR GRAVEL- AND BOULDER-BED STREAMS W05427\ntion holds which can be described by the 1\/6 power\nManning-Strickler relation [MS; equation (4)]. The variable-\npower equation [VPE; equation (20)] with RL and MS as\nasymptotes fits the data compilation as well as any existing\nresistance law. It is not derived from a rigorous physical\nanalysis, but nothing about it is incompatible with known\nphysics. There are precedents for the concept of additive\nsources of resistance; the low-submergence asymptote shares\nthe heuristic basis of the mixing-length and jet-regime\napproaches; the other asymptote is a close approximation of\nthe log law for the deep flows in which it is physically\nplausible; and a gradual shift from one to the other is what\nwould be expected from likely vertical changes in turbulent\neddy scales in flows which have a boundary layer above a\nroughness layer. The variable-power equation may therefore\nbe a useful tool for anyone wanting to predict velocity by a\nsingle equation over a wide range of conditions. The best fit\nto the present data compilation was obtained by reducing the\nMS coefficient a1 by about 20% from its traditional value,\nalthough predictions using the latter are at least as good as\nthose by other equations with default coefficients. A reduc-\ntion in a1 has the same effect as an increase in k\/D84 in the\ngeneralized log law, and the need for both of these adjustments\nprobably has a common cause in form drag on protruding\nclasts in poorly sorted riverbeds. The optimum value of the\nRL coefficient a2 is within the range suggested by Nikora et\nal. [2001] and close to what Gimenez-Curto and Corniero\n[2006] suggested.\n[49] The other new approach is based on a general\nnondimensional hydraulic geometry relation that includes\nmany previous resistance laws as special cases. The sim-\nplest way to apply it is to use either of two specific versions,\nequivalent to the MS and RL relations, according to the\nvalue of the nondimensional unit discharge q* = q\/(gD\n3)0.5.\nThis MS\/RL approach using q* has by far the lowest\nvelocity prediction error of any of the methods tested. It\ncannot be used to estimate discharge for a given depth (for\nexample, bankfull), but it can be used to partition a known or\nassumed discharge between depth and velocity when slope\nand grain size are known. This situation often arises in\necological and geomorphological applications. The way in\nwhich width changes with discharge must be known, but that\nis no more restrictive than the need to know how depth alters\nwith discharge if using d\/D to predict V in the same type of\nsituation, and there is the advantage that width can usually be\nmeasured more precisely and easily than depth. One reason\nwhy q* is a better predictor than d\/D is probably its lesser\nsensitivity to measurement error, as already discussed, but\nthere is another. In gravel bed rivers with significant macro-\nscale form resistance associated with bars or bends, and in\nstep-pool boulder torrents with significant spill resistance,\nV is lower and d higher than would be expected based on skin\nresistance only. The increased depth means that a resistance\nequation using d\/D predicts high, not low, velocity unless\nks\/D84 is set to a very highmultiple [e.g.,Millar, 1999]. But in\nthe hydraulic geometry approach, using unit discharge q = dV\nas predictor, the effects of large-scale resistance on depth and\nvelocity cancel out and there is no overall bias.\n[50] Acknowledgments.
