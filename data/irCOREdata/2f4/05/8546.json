The industrial \nmarketing literature suggests that the origins of this business model can be traced back \nto early 1960s when firms adopted strategies and organizations for \u2018systems selling\u2019. \nThe marketing literature helps us to identify two contrasting types of organizations: \n(1) the vertically-integrated systems seller that produces all the product and service \ncomponents in a system; and (2) the systems integrator that coordinates integration of \ncomponents supplied by external firms. The paper uses these two ideal types to \nanalyse the strategies and organisations of five case study firms that have recently \nattempted to move into the provision of integrated solutions. It argues that there is no \nevidence to support the continuing dominance of the systems seller or a simple \ntransition from systems selling to systems integration. A more complex pattern of \norganizational forms is emerging, combining elements of both systems selling (i.e. \nvertical integration into services) and systems integration.  \n \nKey words:  \nOrganization, integrated solutions, systems seller, systems integrator \n \n \n \n \n 4 \n1. Introduction \n \nThe importance of providing solutions rather than selling products has been seen by \nsome as heralding the emergence of new service-based and customer-centric business \nmodels (Slywotzky 1996; Slywotzky and Morrison 1998; Sharma and Molloy 1999; \nShepherd and Ahmed 2000; Cornet, et. al. 2000; Bennett, et. al. 2001; Galbraith \n2002a and 2002b; Sandberg and Werr 2003). In capital goods, such as IT, telecoms \nand trains, this involves the provision of tailored combinations of products and \nservices as high-value \u2018integrated solutions\u2019 that address the specific needs of large \nbusiness and government customers (Wise and Baumgartner 1999; Davies, et. al., \n2001; Davies, et. al. 2003). For example, Alstom Transport, the train manufacturer, \nnow offers solutions for \u2018train availability\u2019 and Thales Training and Simulation, the \nflight simulator manufacturer, provides military customers with \u2018flight training \nsolutions\u2019. Providers of integrated solutions offer to design and integrate components \ninto a system and provide services to operate, maintain and finance the system during \nits life cycle.  \n \n \nThe aim of this paper is to examine how firms are organizing their internal and \nexternal activities to provide integrated solutions. Different strands of the business \nstrategy literature help to show how firms are repositioning for integrated solutions by \nintegrating forwards into the provision of services (Wise and Baumgartner 1999; \nOliva and Kallenberg 2003 ), developing close relationships with their customers \n(Slywotzky 1996; Slywotzky and Morrison 1998; Hax and Wilde 1999), and creating \ncustomer-focused organizations (Foote, et. al., 1999; Galbraith 2002). While the \n 5 \nstrategy literature helps to identify key elements of integrated solutions provision, it \nover emphasizes the novelty and recent disruptive nature of this business model.  \n \n \nPioneering research on industrial marketing (which is ignored by the mainstream \nmanagement literature) suggests that the origins of integrated solutions provision can \nbe traced back to the early 1960s when firms began to adopt \u2018systems selling\u2019 \nstrategies and organizations (Mattson 1973; Hannaford 1976; Page and Siemplenski \n1983; Dunn and Thomas 1986). Systems selling is defined as the provision of \nproducts and services as integrated systems that provide solutions to a customer\u2019s \noperational needs. According to Azimont et. al. (1998),  systems selling is now \nevolving beyond solving customers\u2019 operational problems to a more strategic form of \nmarketing based on \u2018solutions selling\u2019. This involves providing strategic and \nconsultative advice to help customers achieve strategic objectives such as the \ntransformation of core business processes.  \n \n \nDrawing upon various bodies of literature, the paper identifies two contrasting types \nof organization for the provision of integrated solutions. First, the industrial marketing \nliterature emphasizes the advantages of the \u2018systems seller\u2019, a vertically-integrated \nfirm that produces all or most of the product and service components required for \nintegrated solutions provision. A pure systems seller\u2019s offering is based on a single-\nvendor design incorporating internally developed technology, products and \nproprietary interfaces. Second, the provision of integrated solutions can be undertaken \nby \u2018systems integrator\u2019: a prime contractor organisation responsible for the overall \n 6 \nsystem design and integrating product and service components supplied by a variety \nof external suppliers into a functioning system. This form of organization emphasizes \nthe advantages of specialization and modularity in component supply, standardization \nof interfaces, and the ability to specify and integrate multi-vendor sources of \ntechnology and product supply.  \n \n \nThe paper argues that the traditional advantages of the pure systems seller approach \nare becoming less attractive as customers require more complex integrated solutions, \noften incorporating multi-vendor technologies, products and services. Since the mid-\n1990s, a growing number of systems providers have responded to this demand by \ndeveloping the capabilities and organizational structures required to design and \nintegrate systems out of physical components and services provided by a variety of \ninternal and external suppliers. However, firms are not simply abandoning pure \nsystems seller and adopting pure systems integrator organizations. Drawing upon case \nstudy research of large capital goods suppliers, the paper shows that these firms are \nadopting a variety of hybrid organizational structures that lie between the two ideal \ntypes of systems selling and systems integration.  \n \n \nThe paper begins in Section 2 with a discussion of the key characteristics of integrated \nsolutions provision. A review of the industrial marketing literature suggests that this \nbusiness model should be understood as a recent transition in the longer-term \nevolution of systems selling. Section 3 discusses two ideal types of organizations that \ncan help us to analyse and understand the structures firms are adopting for the \n 7 \nprovision of integrated solutions. Section 4 draws upon case study research to analyse \nthe hybrid organizational structures which combine elements of systems selling and \nsystems integration. Finally, Section 5 provides a cross-case analysis of the different \nhybrid organizational forms being adopted by firms moving into integrated solutions \nprovision.  \n \n2. Integrated solutions: an evolving business model  \n \n2.1. The essential elements of integrated solutions \n \nOver the past decade, a growing body of strategy and consultancy literature has \nidentified a business model for capital goods based on the provision of tailored \ncombinations of products and services as high-value integrated solutions to a \ncustomer needs (Wise and Baumgartner 1999; Davies, et. al., 2001; Davies, et. al., \n2003: Davies 2004; Davies and Hobday 2005). Pioneers of integrated solutions \u2013 such \nas IBM, General Electric and Nokia \u2013 have developed the scale and broad base of \ncapabilities necessary to design, produce and integrate all the product and service \ncomponents into a solution to an individual customer\u2019s business challenges.  \n \n2.1.1. Vertically-integrating from products to services \n \nRather than specialize in the supply of individual components, several authors claim \nthat integrated solutions provision can be understood as a strategy of vertical \nintegration, conceived as a movement forwards from products to services (Wise and \nBaumgartner 1999; Oliva and Kallenberg 2003). According to Wise and Baumgartner \n 8 \n(1999), integrated solutions providers such as Nokia, the mobile communications \nsupplier, are building on their manufacturing capabilities and moving downstream \ninto the provision of integrated packages of products and services to design, build, \noperate and maintain a product during its life cycle. Manufacturing firms are \nachieving this by integrating forwards into service-based activities previously \nundertaken by their customers \u2013 large business or government-owned agencies.  \n \n \nIBM\u2019s experience in the computer industry illustrates the emergence of this business \nmodel in the early 1990s (Gerstner 2002: 57-61). Traditionally, IBM had the \ncapabilities in-house to supply all the components (hardware, software and services) \nof a computer as an integrated system. By the mid-1980s, a new organizational \napproach emerged which challenged the traditional advantages of vertical integration. \nMany smaller specialized firms supplying modular components began to challenge \nIBM\u2019s dominant position. Large business customers \u2013 such as American Express \u2013 \nhad to take responsibility for integrating externally supplied components into a system \nthat solved their unique business requirements. Rather than mirroring this trend \ntowards vertical disintegration by turning IBM into a group of individual component \nsuppliers, Louis Gerstner, IBM\u2019s CEO, executed a strategy in 1993 to build on the \nfirm\u2019s broad base of vertically-integrated capabilities by focusing on the provision of \ncomplete integrated solutions for a customers\u2019 computing and service requirements. \nAt this time, IBM also moved away from its traditional offering based entirely on in-\nhouse technology when it decided to offer to design, install and support a competing \nvendor\u2019s products (e.g. Microsoft, HP and Sun) if this was required to provide a \nsolution to a customer\u2019s needs (Gerstner 2002: 130).  \n 9 \n2.1.2. Customer-centric \n \nThe adoption of this business model changes a firm\u2019s offering from one based on \nselling products to solutions. This customer-centric approach involves working \nbackwards from a customer\u2019s needs and identifying options for mobilizing the \ncapabilities necessary to provide solutions to those needs (Slywotzky 1996; \nSlywotzky and Morrison 1998; Wise and Baumgartner 1999; Hax and Wilde 1999). \nSeveral authors have identified a new type of customer-centric organization for \nsolutions provision (Foote, et. al., 2001; Galbraith 2002). These authors describe how \nlarge vertically-integrated manufacturers including IBM and Sun Microsystems have \nreorganized for solutions provision. In a shift away from traditional structures, \nproduct units are being reorganized to become back-end providers of standardised and \nreplicable components that are combined into solutions provided by newly-formed \ncustomer-facing units. These front-end units are based on temporary projects which \nare continuously formed, combined, and disbanded around each customer\u2019s need for a \nsolution.  \n \n2.2. Systems selling: industrial marketing literature \n \nA review of some key contributions from the industrial marketing literature shows \nthat the essential elements of an integrated solutions business model originated in the \nearly 1960s, when capital goods suppliers first began to adopt systems selling \nstrategies. Based on the following literature review, we suggest that integrated \nsolutions should be seen as the most recent development in the long-term evolution of \nsystems selling.  \n 10 \n2.2.1. Systems selling concept \n \nSystems selling is based on the provision of complete systems rather than individual \ncomponents. Systems sellers combine components into a integrated system that \nprovides a solution to a customer\u2019s business problem (Mattson 1973) or performs a set \nof functions for the customer (Hanniford 1976). The customer does not just buy a \nsystem, but the \u2018expectations of benefits\u2019 a system provides for a customer over time, \nsuch as an operating chemical plant or telecommunication system (Levitt 1983: 89; \nDrucker 1985: 231).  \n \n \nSystems sellers take over responsibility for systems previously used by customer \norganizations as part of their total operational activities, such as inventory control, \nproduction control systems, machine tools, IT and telecom networks. Each system \nsold is comprised of product and service components. Hardware or \u2018product \ncomponents\u2019 are the physical or tangible products that perform a specific function \nwithin the system. Software or \u2018service components\u2019 are the knowledge or intangible \nhuman efforts to solve a customer\u2019s problems and perform activities required to \ndesign, build, operate and maintain a system.  \n \n \nThe early marketing literature recognized and understood that systems sellers must be \ncustomer-centric. Mattson (1973) explains that rather than define its business model \nin terms of product attributes, the systems sellers organizes its activities around the \nneeds of specific customers. Systems sellers identify ways of creating value for \n 11 \ncustomers by reducing purchasing costs, improving operational performance and \nfacilitating system growth by incorporating new products and improving operational \nroutines (Hanniford 1976: 145).  \n \n \nSince the early 1960s many firms have adopted strategies and organizational \nstructures to sell complete systems rather than individual components. However, \nstrategies based on vertically-integrated supply of complete systems of electrical and \ntransportation equipment can be traced back even earlier to early 1900s (Passer 1952; \nChandler 1990; 68-69). Systems selling was initially popular in the aerospace and data \nprocessing industries, but by the 1970s had widely adopted in the marketing of capital \ngoods, such as bank teller equipment, scientific instrumentation, process control \nequipment, machine tools, office equipment and electronic control gear (Page and \nSiemplenski 1983: 89).  \n \n2.2.2. From system to solution \n \nThe early industrial marketing literature distinguishes between component selling \n(products or services) and systems selling. Whereas component sellers supply an \nindividual component of a system, systems sellers provide all components in an \nintegrated system. A more recent contribution to the literature makes a distinction \nbetween systems selling and \u2018solutions selling\u2019 (Azimont, et. al., 1998). Whereas \nsystems sellers are organized to solve a customer\u2019s operational problems, solutions \nsellers offer strategic advice to help a customer develop its business in existing or new \nmarkets.  \n 12 \n \n \nIt should be understood, however, that the idea of providing a solution to a customer\u2019s \nneed has always been central to systems selling.  Paliwoda and Bonaccorsi (1993) \nemphasize that systems sellers create value-added by providing physical products and \nservices as \u2018integrated solutions\u2019 to complex customer problems. The systems sellers \nmust define the customer\u2019s problem and identify the task of integrating components \ninto unique or customized solution. However, the concept of solution selling places \nstronger emphasis on the role of the supplier in offering strategic consultancy advice \nto: \n\u2022 provide an in-depth analysis of a customer\u2019s business \n\u2022 identify and diagnose problems in a customer\u2019s organization (often before the \ncustomer is aware of it) \n\u2022 offer solutions based on its experience of working with a number of \ncustomers facing similar situations \n\u2022 coordinate the integration of components into a solution.  \n \n2.2.3. Standardization vs customization  \n \nThe systems selling literature claims that firms can only achieve profitable and \nsuccessful growth if components of a system are standardized (Mattson 1973: 109; \nHannaford 1976: Page and Siemplenski 1983: 91). The general design interfaces \nbetween components in the systems are designed to be compatible so that components \ncan be adjusted to the unique needs of each customer. Standardized product \ncomponents can be specified and integrated in various predetermined ways to meet \n 13 \nthe specific requirements of individual customers and markets. Service components \ncan also be developed into standardized and simplified methods of operations \n(Hanniford 1976: 141). Rather than being offered at no charge on an ad hoc basis \nupon request of the customer, services are \u2018packaged\u2019 into routines and methods of \noperations. \n \n \nBy developing a basic modular system of components that can be easily configured \nand reconfigured for a variety of customer needs, suppliers can combine the cost \nadvantages of producing standardized product components with high flexibility in \nsystem design (Mattson 1973: 115). If systems sellers develop a comprehensive \noptions list of standardized components, each configuration can be unique, \ncustomized solution. The solution to a customer\u2019s needs is a customized adaptation of \nthe basic modular system and its standardized components. Component \nstandardizations allow the vendor to benefit from economies of scale in production, \nwhile providing each customer with a system configuration \u2018as though it were \nproduced on a job-shop basis\u2019 (Page and Siemplenski 1983: 91).  \n \n \nEfficiency gains can be achieved by spreading the costs of providing solutions over \nmany projects with customers. Customers that design and implement one-off solutions \nfor their own internal needs cannot match the efficiency gains achieved by systems \nsellers. Systems selling involves long-term relationships with customers leading to \nlong-lived, growing and profitable systems programmes, incorporating a range of \nstandardized and replicable components. Rather than accept each customer\u2019s order for \n 14 \na unique one-off system design, a seller-designed programme is led by the seller\u2019s \npredetermined system design rather than the customer\u2019s individual requirements. The \nvendor acts as the single source supplier during the life of the contract and provides a \nprogramme of projects for many customer purchasing problems.  \n \n \nThe recent literature on integrated solutions also emphasizes the importance of \ndeveloping standardized \u2018solutions-ready\u2019 components, that can be combined and \nrecombined at much lower cost than solutions comprised of entirely customized \ncomponents (Davies and Brady 2000; Foote, et. al., 2001; Galbraith 2002; Grabher \n2002; Davies, et. al., 2006). Each solution can be tailored to a customer\u2019s needs by \nusing standardized, reusable and easy-to-deploy modules based on product platforms \nand service portfolios. However, in contrast to traditional systems selling strategies, \nthe literature on integrated solutions emphasises the need for some degree of \ncustomization to solve each customer\u2019s individual needs (Hax and Wilde 1999: 13).  \n \n \nThe proportion of standardized and customized components in a solution varies \naccording to the needs, capabilities and sophistication of the customer (Davies, et. al., \n2006). Less experienced customers often require solutions comprised entirely of \nstandardised offerings. More experienced or sophisticated customers can find their \nneeds are not fully satisfied by standardized solutions. For example, Ericsson has \nworked closely with lead customers such as Vodafone to create highly customized \nsolutions for commercializing the new generation of 3G mobile system technology.    \n \n 15 \n3. Organizing for integrated solutions \n \nThis section begins with a discussion of how the systems selling literature analyses \ndifferent organizational structures. It then presents two ideal types of organizations: \nthe systems seller and the systems integrator (see Figure 1). These are presented as \n\u2018pure forms\u2019 to highlight the distinctiveness of each approach (see Table 1) and to \nhelp analyse and compare emerging organizational structures being adopted by firms \nmoving into integrated solutions provision in Section 4.  \n \n[Figure 1: Ideal types: systems seller and systems integrator] \n \n[Table 1: Types of systems provision] \n \n3.1. Analysis of organizational forms \n \nThe systems selling literature enables us to analyse different organizational \napproaches by distinguishing between two dimensions of systems buying and selling: \nthe customer \u2018make or buy\u2019 decision, and the extent to which the systems seller is a \nvertically-integrated firm or a group of firms.  \n \n3.1.1. Make or buy \n \nThe nature of systems provision depends on a customer\u2019s \u2018make or buy\u2019 decision \n(Page and Siemplenski 1983; Paliwoda and Thomson 1985). The customer can \npurchase a system from an external vendor or develop it internally. The advantage of \n 16 \nprocuring a complete system from a vendor is that it enables the customer to focus on \ndeveloping its core business. For a customer that chooses internal system \ndevelopment, there are two possible arrangements. First, a customer can develop the \nbroad base of capabilities in-house required to produce many or all components of the \nsystem and combine them into a tailored solution to their needs. For example, in the \n1980s state-owned European train operators such as British Rail, Deutsche Bahn and \nSNCF (the French train company) had the capabilities in-house to design trains and \nsignalling systems, manufacture many key components, integrate components into a \nsystem, and operate rolling stock, track, signalling and railway systems.  \n \n \nSecond, a customer may procure the system components from a variety of external \nsuppliers, while concentrating on integrating components into a system and providing \nservices to operate and maintain it. This requires the development of specialized skills \nand resources to search for and order components and to ensure that the components \nconform to the overall system design (Page and Siemplenski 1983: 97). For example, \nin the 1980s and 1990s multinational corporations such as General Motors and \nAmerican Express had large in-house telecom departments responsible for operating \ninternational corporate voice and data networks. These departments integrated \ncomponents \u2013 transmission circuits, switches and terminals \u2013 sourced from a variety \nof external suppliers. \n \n3.1.2. Vertical integration or \u2018group of firms\u2019 \n \n 17 \nThe industrial marketing literature also distinguishes between two forms of systems \nsupply: the vertically-integrated system seller or components supplied by a \u2018group of \nfirms\u2019 that collectively perform the same task as the systems seller (Mattson 1973). \nThese groupings of firms are linked together by partnerships and alliances, often \nworking in temporary consortiums for the duration of a project (Azimont, et. al., \n1998; 10). In most cases, however, a single organization (an internal customer \ndepartment or external supplier) has to assume responsibility for combining the \ncomponents into a system. The group of component sellers is often led by an prime \ncontractor organization called a \u2018systems integrator\u2019, which is responsible for the \noverall design, specification of components and their integration into a system.  \n \n3.2. Systems seller  \n \nIn the \u2018pure form\u2019 of systems selling as Mattson (1973) calls it, the customer procures \na complete system of product and service components from a single vertically-\nintegrated firm (see Figure 1). The system seller is responsible for the whole system \ndesign, interface and component specifications, product development and production \nof individual components, the integration of components into a system and the \nprovision of services to operate and maintain a system during its life cycle. It \nperforms many functions previously performed in-house by the customer \norganization. For the supplier, the systems selling approach offers increased revenues, \nreduced unit costs and brand loyalty. For the customer, it offers rapid system \ninstallation and reduced costs of development and procurement. \n \n \n 18 \nThe systems selling literature recognizes that systems sellers can integrate systems out \nof components externally supplied by multiple vendors, but emphasizes the \nadvantages of a single-vendor approach to system design and component \ndevelopment. According to Hannaford (1976: 141), a \u2018seller-designed system\u2019 is a set \nof standardized components that should be designed in advance by the vendor. A \nsystems programme is based on upon a basic system design that can be adapted for \nmany customers. Page and Siemplenski (1983: 93) claim that general system design \ndeveloped by single vendor creates a high degree of complementarity among \ncomponents: \u2018If the system is well conceived, the superior \u2018fit\u2019 of its components, \nwhich we will call interfacing efficiency, results in competitive advantage over \nsystems constructed out of separate components\u2019 (Page and Siemplenski 1983: 95).  \n \nIBM\u2019s strategy for selling computers in the 1960s and 1970s is held up as a classic \nexample of systems selling (Dunn and Thomas 1986: 1).  IBM\u2019s System\/360 \nintroduced in 1964 was the first computer based on a modular design. Under this \napproach, physical components of a computer \u2013 or modules \u2013 could be designed by \nseparate specialized groups working independently. The modules could then be \nintegrated as long as they conformed to a pre-determined design (Baldwin and Clark \n2000: 6). Although IBM\u2019s System\/360 computer was based on modular hardware \ncomponents which could be configured to meet each customer\u2019s needs, the software \ncomponents and interfaces in the system were proprietary. Once a customer had \npurchased an IBM computer, the complex operating system made it difficult to switch \nto another vendor\u2019s system. Under IBM\u2019s bundling strategy, the customer purchased a \ncomplete system of IBM hardware, software and service support, and had it installed \n 19 \nfor a single price. Bundling is a strategy for selling potentially separable components \nto customers only as an integrated system or \u2018bundle\u2019 (Porter 1985: 425).  \n \n3.3. Systems integrator \n \nIn its pure form, a systems integrator is the single prime contractor organization \nresponsible for designing and integrating externally supplied product and service \ncomponents into a system for an individual customer (see Figure 1). Page and \nSiemplenski (1983: 90) identify the systems integrator as an important early form of \nsystem procurement. They point out that the systems integrator approach was first \nused by the US military during the 1940s and 1950s to procure weapons systems from \na prime contractor. A similar approach called general management was used in the \nconstruction of dams, oil refineries and nuclear power plants.  \n \n \nAlthough systems integration is recognized as one of the key activities performed \ninternally by systems sellers (Page and Siemplenski 1983; Paliwoda and Bonaccorsi \n1993; Gunter and Bonaccorsi 1996; Bonaccorsi, et. al., 1996) or customer \norganizations (Millman 1996: 637), the industrial marketing literature neglects to \nsystematically analyse the strengths of this form of organization as an alternative to \nthe systems seller approach.  \n \n \nA different body of literature from innovation studies has emphasized the advantages \nof systems integration compared with traditional vertically-integrated structures \n 20 \n(Brusoni, et. al., 2001; Prencipe, et. al., 2003; Hobday, et. al., 2005). These authors \nemphasize the advantages of specialization at the systems integration and component \nlevels. A pure systems integrator focuses on the component integration task, while \ncoordinating the activities of many external suppliers. This external network expands \nthe capabilities and range of components that can be combined to create value for its \ncustomers (Galbraith 2002b: 139). For example, Boeing has positioned itself as \nsystems integrator for airframe assembly, while subcontracting about 80 per cent of \ncomponent production to specialists around the world. A component supplier \nspecialises in a few activities and attempts to become the best in the world at \nproviding a few products and services to many customers. A systems integrator is \nmore than an assembler of product components, because it is responsible for the \ngeneral system design, selection and coordination of a network of external component \nsuppliers, integration of components into a functioning system, and the development \nof technological knowledge needed for future systems upgrades.   \n \nThe trend towards modularity and open standards in industries has increased the \npossibilities for firms to specialize in component supply and\/or systems integration. \nFor example, as modularity became adopted widely in the industry during the 1970s \nand 1980s, hundreds of new specialists suppliers of modular components, which could \nbe added to IBM computers, entered the industry and successfully challenged IBM\u2019s \ndominant position as a systems seller (Baldwin and Clark 2000). \n \nIn recent years, an increasing number of large capital goods manufacturers have been \ntransitioning from \u2018being vertically-integrated (doing everything in-house) to being an \nintegrator of somebody else\u2019s activities\u2019 (Hobday, et. al., 2003: 1). However, the \n 21 \nliterature tends to assume that systems integrators are manufacturing firms that have \nbeen outsourcing standardized and low-cost production activities and focusing on \nhigher value added systems integration activities already performed in-house (e.g. \nBrusoni et al., 2001). This under emphasizes the variety of systems integrator \norganizations, and their changing roles in projects. There are many examples of firms \ntraditionally based in services with no in-house manufacturing capability (e.g. BT, \nEDS, LogicaCMG and Atkins) that have also begun focus on being systems \nintegrators of components sourced from a variety of suppliers (Davies 2004). Firms \nalso perform different roles in projects: a firm may be a systems integrator on one \nproject, while performing the role of a component supplier to a systems integrator on \nanother project. \n \n \nCustomer demand for more complex solutions based on components supplied by a \nvariety of firms is an important driver behind the emergence of systems integrators \noffering multi-vendor solutions. This involves a willingness to specify, integrate and \nservice a competitor\u2019s technology, products and installed base, should the customer \ndemand it or should it provide a superior solution to a customer\u2019s needs (Foote, et. al., \n2001).  \n \n4. Case studies: reorganizing for integrated solutions provision \n \nThis section presents five short case studies which use the two contrasting types of \nsystems providers to examine how different firms have been reorganizing to provide \nintegrated solutions. The empirical evidence is based on the findings of a \n 22 \ncollaborative research project conducted during 2000-2003 (the findings are available \nin Davies, et. al., 2001 & 2003), which studied the recent changes in the strategies of \nfive international suppliers of capital goods:  \n\u2022 Alstom Transport \u2013 rolling stock and signalling systems \n\u2022 Ericsson Mobile Systems \u2013 mobile phone networks \n\u2022 Thales Training and Simulation \u2013 flight simulation \n\u2022 Atkins \u2013 infrastructure and the built environment \n\u2022 Cable and Wireless (C&W) Global Markets \u2013 corporate telecom networks \n \n \nThe cross-sectoral sample of firms was selected to examine how firms in different \nmanufacturing and service industries have been changing their strategies and \norganization to move into integrated solutions provision. The case studies describe the \nchanges implemented by the firms between 1995, when several of the firms started \ntheir first integrated solutions projects, and 2003.  \n \n4.1. Manufacturing firms \n \n4.1.1. Alstom Transport \n \nIn the mid-1990s, Alstom Transport \u2013 a division within the Alstom group \u2013 was a \nproduct seller, which was integrated backwards into component supply. Alstom\u2019s \nproduct components were produced by two manufacturing divisions: the Passenger \nbusiness unit was responsible the design and manufacturing of rolling stock, and the \nEquipment business unit produced primary components including bogies, electrical, \n 23 \nelectronic and traction systems. These product components were designed and \nproduced to meet detailed technical specifications set by Alstom\u2019s customers, the \nlarge state-owned railway companies that integrated the components and operated the \nrailway system. At the time, Alstom\u2019s services were limited to maintenance services \noffered for free to clinch the product sale.  \n \n \nSince 1995, Alstom Transport has been implementing a strategy to move from \u2018being \na seller of goods to a system and service provider\u2019 (Owen 1997). This has involved \nmoving out of low-value and standardized component manufacturing. By 2001 \nAlstom Transport was outsourcing around 90 per cent of the components in its rolling \nstock products, while continuing to design and produce critical subsystems such as \ntraction systems.  \n \n \nFrom this foothold in product component selling, Alstom has been expanding into \nsystems integration and the provision of services to operate and maintain trains. \nAlstom Systems business is a pure systems integrator organization, responsible for \ncombining components sourced from both its in-house manufacturing divisions and \nexternal suppliers. The division provides fixed infrastructure, rolling stock and \nsignalling systems as a single integrated package. By developing its capabilities in \nproject management, engineering and financial services combined with traditional \ndesign and build capabilities, the Systems business is able to provide customers with \ncomplete systems solutions.  \n \n 24 \n \nIn 1998, a Service Business was created as a result of a strategic review of Alstom\u2019s \nglobal activities, which recognized the huge growth in the market for rolling stock \nmaintenance services. Alstom offers comprehensive services to maintain rolling stock \n\u2013 functions previously conducted by national railway monopolies. The division \nprovides its customers \u2013 the training operating companies \u2013 with complete transport \nsolutions for \u2018train availability\u2019 during the life cycle of the product.  \n \n4.1.2. Ericsson \n \nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Ericsson evolved from a broad-based manufacturer of \ntelecoms equipment to focus on the supply of complete mobile communications \nsystems. In 1996, Ericsson formed two main product divisions for mobile \ncommunications: a terminal division responsible for producing mobile handsets and a \nsystems division responsible for all the components (e.g. radio base stations, data \nbases, operating systems and switches) integrated into mobile communication \nsystems. At this time, services were provided by the product divisions.  \n \n \nIn 1996, Ericsson\u2019s Corporate Executive Committee completed a strategic plan, called \n\u20182005 \u2013 Ericsson entering the twenty-first century\u2019, which initiated its strategy to \nprovide mobile operators with \u2018solutions and services\u2019 (Ericsson 1996: 7). The report \nrecognized the trend for mobile operators to outsource many network design, systems \nintegration and operational activities previously performed in-house. In 1999, \nEricsson combined its resources in service offerings and business consulting activities \n 25 \nto create Ericsson Services, \u2018thus strengthening Ericsson\u2019s position as complete \nsupplier, system integrator and partner\u2019 (Ericsson 1999: 7). In June 2000 Ericsson\u2019s \nsystems integration and service activities were brought together to form a new \ndivision called Ericsson Global Services to provide systems integration and service \nactivities for mobile phone operators throughout the world. In 2001, Global Services \nbecame one of Ericsson\u2019s five business units, responsible for developing a global \nservice portfolio and supplying staff and resources to help the front-end units design \nand sell solutions. The division is responsible for providing a portfolio of simplified \nand standardized services called \u2018Advise, Integrate, Manage\u2019 which are configured to \nmeet each mobile operator\u2019s needs for customized solutions. \n \n \nSince the late 1990s, Ericsson has outsourced an increasing proportion of its \nmanufacturing activities. By 2001, many of Ericsson\u2019s products (including exchange \nequipment, radio base stations and handsets) were outsourced and manufactured under \ncontract by Flextronics, the specialized product seller. In 2003 Ericsson made another \nreorganization to support its move into integrated solutions. It formed 28 market units \nand created customer-facing units to deal with its largest global customer accounts. \nUnder this organization, all activities with mobile operators from strategic \nengagement to solutions delivery are undertaken by the customer facing units. \nEricsson\u2019s in-house product and service divisions are providers of components \ndelivered through a global network of customer-facing units. \n \n4.1.3. Thales Training and Simulation \n \n 26 \nThales Training and Simulation (TT&S) is part of the aerospace business of the \nThales group, a large defence and electronics manufacturer. Until the mid-1990s, \nTT&S was one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of flight simulators. It supplied \nits defence (military air forces and departments of defence) and civil airline customers \nwith stand-alone flight simulators and computer-based training devices. TT&S \ndesigned, manufactured and integrated key components in the final product and its \ncustomers used simulators to train pilots.  \n \n \nBy 2000, however, Thales had outsourced much of its standardized component \nmanufacturing activities in order to focus on the core systems integration task. It is \nworking with a network of external component suppliers to ensure that product \ncomponents conform to TT&S\u2019s overall systems design and can be tailored exactly to \na customer\u2019s requirements.  \n \n \nIn the defence sector, TT&S changed its strategy in the late 1990s to provide flight \ntraining services. Thales Defence is taking over responsibility for pilot training and \nother services previously performed by its military customers. As Vice Chairman of \nThales, explained: \u2018Whereas a few years ago you could sell a unit and walk away, \ngenerating a profit now depends more on selling services, selling hours on simulator \nservices\u2019 (Mulholland 2000). Thales provides military customers with simulators and \ntraining services as integrated \u2018training solutions\u2019 by offering to train pilots over the \n20-25 year life cycle of a simulator. \n \n 27 \n \nIn civil markets for flight simulators attempts to move flight training have been \nfrustrated by training organizations, including the airline customers (with their own \nin-house training facilities) and specialized independent training schools, which \npurchase simulators and already provide an extensive range of flight training services. \nAs major airlines have outsourced training, it has been the training schools \u2013 rather \nthan simulator producers \u2013 which have taken on the training tasks, despite the efforts \nof Thales and other producers to move into training services.  \n \n4.2. Service firms \n \n4.2.1. Atkins \n \nUnlike vertically-integrated product sellers that have grown initially by providing \nservices to support internally developed systems, Atkins is now a systems integrator \nand service provider, with no in-house manufacturing capabilities.  \n \n \nIn the mid-1990s, Atkins was a seller of services such as project management, \ntechnical consultancy and support services across sectors as diverse as transport, \nproperty management, defence and public health. Atkins implemented a strategy in \n1998 to reorganize the firm to meet customer demand in the public and private sectors \nfor longer-term contracts involving the provision of \u2018an increasing range of services\u2019 \n(WS Atkins 1999; 6). The firm\u2019s objective was to become \u2018the world\u2019s first choice \nsupplier for technical services and integrated solutions for the built environment\u2019 (WS \n 28 \nAtkins 1999; 4). Since 1999, Atkins has continued to develop its portfolio of services \nby acquiring firms offering specialized services such as facilities management and \nproperty services.  \n \n \nAtkins\u2019s move into integrated solutions is based on its role as a systems integrator of \nexternally supplied product components. Rather than perform the role of \nsubcontractor, Atkins aims to handle prime contracts for systems integration contracts \nand to subcontract components that it cannot provide internally. Atkins designs and \nproject manages the integration of systems supplied large product suppliers across \ndifferent industries. For example, Atkins Rail buys and integrates equipment from \nrailway manufacturers (e.g. Alstom, Siemens and Bombardier). By offering multi-\nvendor solutions to its customers, Atkins Rail can compete with systems sellers to \nperform the role of systems integrator on major contracts. Growing rapidly by \nhorizontal integration, Atkins developed its capabilities as a systems integrator by \nrecruitment and acquisition of complementary businesses. In the late 1990s, for \nexample, WS Atkins Rail acquired expertise and complementary systems \ntechnologies by purchasing British Rail\u2019s Powertrack Unit, NTES (rolling stock \ndesign), Opal (signalling), and Adtranz\u2019s signalling business.  \n \n4.2.2.Cable and Wireless Global Markets \n \nIn the mid-1990s, Cable & Wireless (C&W) was a leading international telecom \noperator providing services to consumer and business markets. Demand for integrated \nsolutions first arose in 1997 when some of C&W\u2019s largest multinational customers \n 29 \n(e.g. Standard Charter Bank, Chase Manhattan and Compaq) began to request more \ncomplex, high-value, outsourcing solutions for their global telecom needs. In global \noutsourcing contracts, C&W had to take over responsibility for network ownership \nand service performance for a fixed contract period and a fixed price. To meet its \ncustomers\u2019 demands, David Sexton, Chief Executive of C&W Global Markets, \nrecognized that \u2018suppliers must redefine their role as value-generating integrators, \nrather than low-cost component suppliers\u2019 (C&W 1999: 5). To achieve this, C&W \nhad to develop its role as a multi-vendor systems integrator, able to design and \nintegrate systems supplied by a variety of vendors.  \n \n \nIn the late 1990s, C&W attempted to create a centralized organization to provide \nglobal outsourcing solutions for corporate telecom networks, based on internet \nprotocol (IP) technology. The strategy entailed moving beyond the supply of \ncomponents (called Managed Network Services) into higher-value systems integration \nand customer outsourcing services. In 1998, C&W Global Businesses were created to \nfocus on meeting the highly profitable business demand for IP and data services. At \nthe heart of this organization was Global Markets, a systems integrator organization \nwhich designed, built and managed corporate networks, using product components \nsupplied by external manufacturers (for example, Nortel and Cisco Systems) and \nnetwork facilities provided in-house. By 2000, C&W\u2019s strategy was reformulated in \nterms of a plan to move from its base as an operator of global telecom networks into \nthe provision of \u2018total integrated solutions\u2019 to its multinational corporate customers \nneeds for voice, data and IP services.  \n \n 30 \n \nBut C&W\u2019s attempts to move into integrated solutions were unsuccessful. It was \nunable to force its internal regional business units to relinquish control of profitable \ncorporate accounts and faced strong competition from major systems integrators \n(large consultancy organizations such as Accenture and PriceWaterhouseCoopers) \nthat were highly successful in global outsourcing solutions markets. As a result of \nthese factors and the collapse of telecom markets during 2002, C&W finally \nabandoned its attempts to move into integrated solutions in 2003 when if formed \nstrategic partnership with Accenture: C&W has reverted back to a seller of \ncomponents and services in outsourcing solutions that Accenture designs, integrates \nand offers to corporate customers.  \n \n5. Emerging organizational forms \n \nSince 1995 all of the case study firms have initiated many organizational changes to \nsupport their moves into integrated solutions. The path of organizational development \nof each firm has been shaped by the traditional activities performed by the firms prior \nto their repositioning (see Davies 2004). Although all five firms have integrated \nforwards into services, this does not support the view that firms moving into the \nprovision of integrated solutions are adopting systems seller structures based on \nvertically-integrated component supply. Firms based in services with no internal \nproduct capability are moving into integrated solutions provision and the \nmanufacturing firms in our study rely increasingly on outsourcing for the supply of \nmany physical components. Instead the firms in our study have been adopting a \nvariety of forms to organize the integration of product and services from a variety of \n 31 \ninternal and external component sellers. These hybrid structures attempt to combine \nsome of the advantages of systems selling and systems integration.  \n \n \n5.1. Component sellers  \n \nOur research shows that component sellers are organising to supply solutions-ready \nproducts and services that can be configured by internal systems integrator units for \nindividual customer needs. Component sellers can be in-house organizations or \nexternal partners supplying the core product or service components of a solution.  \n \n5.1.1. Product components \n \nOver the past decade, the three manufacturing firms in our research have become \nmore reliant on external product sellers to supply physical components. Alstom, \nEricsson and Thales still have important in-house product divisions responsible for \ndeveloping the common technology and standardized product platforms. These \ndevelopment efforts ensure that components can be easily configured to form an \nintegrated system for each customer. However, these internal product sellers are \nbecoming more specialised. They have been reorganized to design and manufacture \nonly a limited number of complex and high-value components, while outsourcing a \ngrowing proportion of their standardised component production activities. For \nexample, Ericsson has entered into a partnership with Flextronics, a specialised \nproduct seller that has grown successfully by specializing in the design and \nproduction of major components for several of the mobile systems suppliers.  \n 32 \n \n5.1.2. Service components \n \nThe manufacturing firms in our study have made significant efforts to integrate \nforwards into service provision. Alstom, Ericsson and Thales now provide an \nextensive range of services to operate and maintain their products and systems. \nAlstom and Ericsson have established two separate divisions to provide an augmented \nservice portfolio as part of their integrated solutions offerings. These service divisions \nare responsible for creating standardised services that can be offered as part of the \nintegrated solutions for each customer. Ericsson estimates that up to 75% of the \nservice component of its integrated solutions can be based on pre-defined service \nmodules: the remaining 25% of service components are customized by Ericsson\u2019s \nsystems integrator units to meet each customer\u2019s needs. This modular, reusable \napproach cuts costs and improves the reliability of the integrated solutions. Based on \nstandardized business processes, pricing, and guarantees for service reliability, the \nservice portfolio is constantly revised to improve the process of selling and delivering \nsolutions. \n \n \nFirms based in services must enter into strategic partnerships with product sellers to \nprovide a reliable source of technology and products. However, they have also had to \ndevelop a more extensive portfolio of services. For example, C&W extended its \nservice offering to address its customers outsourcing needs for higher-value added and \nmore complex services, such as providing e-commerce, security, application software \nprovision, and business process outsourcing. Atkins offers its customers a range of \n 33 \nservices such as design, business development, planning, safety advice, tender \npreparation and project management. In 2000, Atkins created a joint venture company \nwith the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) called \u2018Total Solutions for Industry\u2019 which \nprovides customers with integrated solutions for small outsourcing and PFI contracts: \nAtkins performs system design, integration and maintenance, while RBS provide the \nfinance.  \n \n5.2. Systems integrators \n \nThe case studies show that several firms have established internal systems integrator \norganizations, ranging from single projects to permanent business units set up to meet \na customer\u2019s ongoing needs for systems programmes. These customer-facing \norganizations are responsible for managing strategic engagements with each \ncustomer, developing proposals, integrating systems and arranging the provision of \noperational services. Since the mid-1990s, Ericsson, Alstom, Atkins and C&W have \nprogressively reorganized their entire firms so that the components supplied by \ninternal units and external partners are channelled to the systems integrator \norganizations at the point of contact with the customer.  \n \n \nThe five firms in our study have initiated strategies to perform systems integration \nbased on single-vendor and\/or multi-vendor components. Single-vendor systems are \ncomprised of product components developed internally by vertically-integrated \nmanufacturers, such as TT&S\u2019s proprietary flight simulator products. While TT&S \n 34 \noutsources much of the production of components parts of its flight simulators, it is \nresponsible for major technology development and design of all major components.  \n \n \nMulti-vendor systems are developed and integrated from externally developed \ncomponents. The service firms in our research have set up pure systems integrator \norganisations. By developing partnerships with multiple technology and product \nvendors, Atkins and C&W have been able to offer multi-vendor systems integration \nexpertise as part of their integrated solutions offerings. C&W established a specialised \nsystems integrator organisation called C&W Global Markets to design and integrate \ncomponents of IP and other components produced by Nortel and Cisco Systems. \nAtkins has established a number for pure systems integrators units, such as Atkins \nRail, for a variety of different horizontal market segments.  \n \n \nAlstom and Ericsson have extended beyond their traditional single-vendor systems \ninto the provision of multi-vendor solutions. Both firms have created internal units to \nperform the same function as a specialised systems integrator. Alstom Systems is a \npure systems integrator division responsible for providing railway operating \ncompanies with turnkey solutions, comprised of multi-vendor products and services \nsupplied in temporary multi-firm project consortiums led by Alstom. Ericsson\u2019s \ncustomer-facing units, such as Ericsson Vodafone, work in collaborative project \nteams with the customer and a variety of external suppliers to provide each global \nmobile phone operator with integrated system and services.  \n \n 35 \n6. Conclusions \n \nThis paper has shown that provision of integrated solutions is not a radically new \nbusiness model. Strategies to provide product and service components as integrated \nsystems and solutions to customer\u2019s individual requirements originated in the early \n1960s. Drawing upon different bodies of literature, we presented two contrasting \ntypes of organizations: (1) the vertically-integrated systems seller that produces all the \nproduct and service components in a system; and (2) the systems integrator that \ncoordinates integration of components supplied by external firms. It is clear from our \nresearch on that firms moving into integrated solutions provision over the past decade \nhave been abandoning traditional forms of vertical integration (based on backwards \nintegration towards physical component supply) and adopting new organizational \nforms. However, there is no evidence to support the continuing dominance of the \nsystems seller in these evolving markets or a simple transition from systems selling to \nsystems integration approaches. A more complex pattern of organizational forms is \nemerging, combining elements of both systems selling and systems integration.  \n \n \nThe case studies show that providers of integrated solutions are becoming less \ndependent on broad-based in-house product component capabilities. For example, \nAlstom, Ericsson and Thales are becoming increasingly reliant on specialist \nmanufacturers, such as Flextronics, to supply them with standardised and modular \ncomponents. Our research suggests that the largest proportion of activities undertaken \nin-house is shifting towards the service component of each firm\u2019s integrated solutions \noffering. All five firms have made substantial efforts to integrate forwards into service \n 36 \ncomponents, including consultancy advice, guarantees of systems reliability and \nresponsiveness, and services to operate, maintain and finance a system over its life \ncycle. As Levitt (1983: 89) recognized many years ago, services that enable customers \nto gain benefits from the system are becoming more important than the underlying \ntechnology.  \n \n \nMost importantly, the ability to integrate a range of components from a variety of \ninternal and external suppliers is becoming the core activity required to provide \nintegrated solutions. The traditional advantages of the vertically-integrated systems \nseller offering single-vendor designed systems is no longer a major source of \ncompetitive advantage in many industries. Customers are demanding more complex \nsolutions, incorporating technologies, products and specialised services provided by \nnumerous external suppliers. In response to such demands, firms with no ties to in-\nhouse technology or products, such as Atkins and C&W, created new organisations to \nperform the role of pure systems integrator. Alstom and Ericsson has set up \nspecialised divisions, units and individual projects to provide a variety of customers \nwith integrated solutions based on single- and multi-vendor components.  \n \n \n \n 37 \nReferences \nAzimont, F., Cova, B., and Salle, R.
