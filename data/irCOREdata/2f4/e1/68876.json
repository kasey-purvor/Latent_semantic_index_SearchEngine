INTRODUCTION\nSemiclassical methods provide valuable insight into\nthe eigenmodes of electromagnetic microresonators and\nmesoscopic electronic devices because they establish a\ndirect relation to classical trajectories. For stable or-\nbits the corresponding wavefunctions are localized in the\nvicinity of the trajectory and can be constructed by the\nelegant asymptotic boundary layer (ABL) method, which\nis based on rectified Gaussian beams and their harmonic\ntransverse excitations [1, 2, 3, 4]. Describing wavefunc-\ntions associated with unstable orbits is a considerably\nmore difficult problem. For classically chaotic quantum\nsystems [5], the rapid stretching and folding of the phase\nspace translates into a randomization of most eigenstates,\nwhich can be addressed through statistical descriptions\n[6, 7]. However, some eigenstates deviate significantly\nfrom a random wave pattern in that they are enhanced\nin the vicinity of unstable orbits [5, 8, 9]. These so-called\nscars are most pronounced for short periodic orbits, and\noften dominate the individual properties of quantum sys-\ntems. Their influence has been detected in numerous nu-\nmerical investigations and experiments on a large variety\nof systems, such as microwave cavities [10], resonant tun-\nnelling diodes [11], and, in particular, in the lasing modes\nof dielectric microresobators [12].\nPioneering theoretical investigations of individual scar\nwavefunctions retained the assumption of a Gaussian\ntransverse profile and its harmonic excitations [8, 9, 13,\n14]. It was soon realized that this requires to superpose a\nlarge number of transverse excitations [15, 16]. On aver-\nage, the large-distance asymptotic decay of the transverse\nprofile is expected to follow a power law [17, 18, 19, 20].\nStudies of hyperbolic fixed points (with effective period\n0) also point into the direction that the transverse pro-\nfiles are essentially non-Gaussian [21, 22, 23]. On the\nother hand, numerical investigations [24] have led to the\nconjecture that scar quantization only involves a single\n(longitudinal) quantum number, which means that the\ntransverse mode profile is fixed.\nIn this paper we clarify the nature of scarred states\nfrom the perspective the ABL method, which offers a sys-\ntematic semiclassical expansion for the Schro\u00a8dinger equa-\ntion in the asymptotic boundary layer around a classical\ntrajectory [1]. Compared to other semiclassical meth-\nods, a main advantage of the ABL method is its appli-\ncability to a broad class systems, including systems in\nexternal potentials and magnetic fields. ABL expansion\nup to quadratic terms of the effective potential yields\nthe Gaussian wave packet solution, originally proposed\nby Heller [8] as a convenient ansatz to study dynamics\nof complex molecules. Subsequent mathematical studies\n[1, 2, 30] advanced the method into a powerful general\ntool to obtain asymptotic solutions to various equations\nof theoretical and mathematical physics, ranging from\noptics to gravity.\nMost of these applications, however, focus on station-\nary eigenstates associated with stable periodic orbits.\nThe application of the ABL formalism to unstable orbits\nfaces the problem that Gaussian beams fail to satisfy the\nperiodicity condition along such orbits. In principle, this\nproblem can be circumvented by numerical superposition\nof a large (ideally, infinite) number of Gaussian solutions\nfor an artificially stabilized orbit [15]. However, as we\nwill show, it is possible to take a more direct analytic ap-\nproach, which focusses on the mathematical difference of\nthe ABL equations for stable and unstable trajectories.\nThis allows to obtain closed analytical expressions for in-\ndividual wavefunctions localized around unstable trajec-\ntories. A detailed analysis of these solutions reveals the\nspecial role of the so-called separatrix solution in the for-\nmation of scar states. This yields a transverse mode pro-\nfile that corresponds to an appropriately rectified specific\nsolution of the hyperbolic fixed-point problem [21, 22, 23]\nand also satisfies the correct large-distance asymptotics\n2[17, 18]. The periodicity condition for the separatrix so-\nlution leads to a Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization formulae\nwith a single longitudinal quantum number, in agreement\nwith the earlier numerical conjecture of Ref. [24]. These\ngeneral considerations are presented in Sections II-IV.\nIn Section V we illustrate the flexibility of the ABL\napproach by applying it to the example of a two-\ndimensional strip resonator in a magnetic field and a\nparabolic confinement potential. Comparison of the ABL\npredictions with the results of numerical computations\ndemonstrates excellent accuracy of the method.\nSection VI contains discussion and conclusions. Details\nof the derivations are presented in the Appendix.\nII. ABL FORMALISM\nIn the following two sections we provide the main re-\nsults of the ABL formalism and cast them into an outfit\nwhich naturally contrasts states localized around stable\nand unstable trajectories. Details of the derivation of\nthe main formulas are given in Appendix. To make the\npresentation compact we concentrate on two-dimensional\nquantum systems in a constant perpendicular magnetic\nfield B, with vector potential A = B(\u2212y, x)\/2.\nWe employ a curvilinear system of coordinates asso-\nciated with the main classical trajectory r0(s), which is\nparameterized by its arclength s. A pair of coordinates\n(s, n) defines the position vector in the vicinity of the\ntrajectory as r = r0(s) + en(s)n, where en is the normal\nunit vector and n measures the distance from the trajec-\ntory. The ABL formalism seeks a solution in an asymp-\ntotically small boundary layer of width \u221d \u221ah\u00af around the\nmain trajectory, which introduces a natural scaling of the\ndistance as n =\n\u221a\nh\u00af \u03bd. The solution of the Schro\u00a8dinger\nequation is sought in the form\n\u03a8(s, \u03bd) = e\ni\nh\u00af\n(S0(s)+S1(s)\n\u221a\nh\u00af \u03bd)\n\u221e\u2211\nj=0\nh\u00afj\/2\u03c8(j)(s, \u03bd), (1)\nwhich represents an expansion in half-integer powers of\nPlanck\u2019s constant h\u00af (in contrast to the text-book WKB\nexpansion in integer powers of h\u00af). This expansion of the\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation (see Appendix) yields the exponent\nin Eq. (1) in the form of the classical action functions\nS0 =\n\u222b s\n0\n{a(s) + e(Axeyn \u2212Ayexn)} ds, (2a)\nS1 = e(Axe\nx\nn +Aye\ny\nn), (2b)\na(s) =\n\u221a\n2m[E \u2212 u(r0(s))], (2c)\nwhere u(r) is the scalar potential. For \u03c8(j) one obtains\na hierarchical set of equations. If the expansion of the\neffective potential in the system can be restricted to the\nterms of second order in n (the standard assumption in\nthe linear theories [9, 14]), one can restrict the series in\nEq. (1) to the leading term \u03c8 \u2261 \u03c8(0) and obtains the\nso-called boundary layer Schro\u00a8dinger equation\ni\u03c8\u02d9(s, \u03bd) =\n(\n\u2212 1\n2a\n\u22022\u03bd +\nad\n2\n\u03bd2 \u2212 i\n2\na\n)\n\u03c8(s, \u03bd), (3)\nd(s) =\n2mu2\na2\n+\nm2u21\na4\n\u2212 2mu1\n\u03c1a2\n\u2212 eB\n\u03c1a\n.\nHere the dot denotes the partial derivative \u2202s, while \u03c1 is\nthe geometric radius of curvature of the trajectory. The\nfunctions u1,2 are obtained from the expansion\nu(r) \u2248 u0(r0(s)) + u1(s)\n\u221a\nh\u00af \u03bd + u2(s)h\u00af \u03bd\n2. (4)\nEquation (3) is analogous to the Schro\u00a8dinger equation\nfor a one-dimensional nonstationary oscillator, where s,\na(s), and d(s) take the role of time, mass, and harmonic\nfrequency, respectively. As shown in the Appendix, a\ngeneral form of its partial solutions can be constructed by\nestablishing their relation with the classical trajectories\nin the vicinity of the main one. The final result yields a\nset of solutions of the form\n\u03c8\u03be(s, \u03bd) \u221d z\n\u03be(\u0393\u2212 \u0393)\u03be\/2\u221a\naz\nD\u03be\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\u221a\n\u0393\u2212 \u0393\n2i\n\u03bd\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 e i4 (\u0393+\u0393)\u03bd2 ,\n(5)\nwhere D\u03be are parabolic cylinder functions with arbitrary\nindex \u03be, while \u0393 = p\/z and \u0393 = p\/z are defined by\ntwo independent solutions of the Hamilton equations in\nvariation\nz\u02d9 =\np\na\n, p\u02d9 = \u2212adz, (6)\nthat satisfy pz\u2212pz = w (w is the Wronskian, which here\nis a constant). A pair (z, p) describes the classical trajec-\ntories in the vicinity of the main trajectory. Once Eqs.\n(6) are solved, Eqs. (1), (2) and (5) define semiclassical\nsolutions of the Schro\u00a8dinger equation. A second class of\npartial solutions is found by interchanging z \u2194 z in Eq.\n(5).\nThe similarity of Eq. (5) with a standard oscillator\ncan be seen by assuming constant a (\u201cmass\u201d m) and d\n(squared \u201cfrequency\u201d \u03c92). If one also chooses solutions to\nEq. (6) as z \u221d exp(i\u03c9s), Eq. (5) yields familiar oscillator\nwave functions. In the general case, the detailed depen-\ndence of a and d on s results in nontrivial modulations\nof the wave function profile along the trajectory.\nIII. PERIODIC ORBITS\nSince there are two partial solutions of Eq. (6), the\ngeneral solution Eq. (5) for the wave function possesses\none degree of freedom. For closed periodic orbits, how-\never, this freedom is restricted by an additional period-\nicity condition. As we shall see, this condition naturally\ndistinguishes between stable and unstable orbits.\nFor stable orbits we follow a standard procedure, the\nfirst step of which is to find the Floquet solutions of Eq.\n3(6), which fulfill the conditions z(T ) = exp(i\u03c6)z(0) and\np(T ) = exp(i\u03c6)p(0). Here T is the period of the orbit\nand \u03c6 is a real Floquet phase. If (z1,2, p1,2) are two inde-\npendent solutions with initial conditions (1, 0) and (0, 1),\nrespectively, the general solution is a linear combination(\nz\np\n)\n= \u03b11\n(\nz1\np1\n)\n+ \u03b12\n(\nz2\np2\n)\n. (7)\nFloquet solutions are found by determining \u03b11, \u03b12, and\n\u039b = exp(i\u03c6) from the eigenvalue problem\nM\n(\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n)\n= \u039b\n(\n\u03b11\n\u03b12\n)\n, M =\n(\nz1(T ) z2(T )\np1(T ) p2(T )\n)\n. (8)\nHere M is the monodromy matrix (with a unit determi-\nnant), which depends on the stability of the orbit.\nFor stable orbits |Tr M | < 2, and M has two com-\nplex conjugate eigenvalues with a unit absolute value.\nThe corresponding Floquet solutions are also complex\nconjugate, (z, p) and (z, p) = (z\u2217, p\u2217). We use the con-\nvention that (z, p) is the solution with Im\u0393 > 0. This\nchoice is well-defined since Im\u0393 \u221d |z|\u22122 does not change\nsign along the trajectory. With this choice, Eq. (5) is\nrestricted to normalizable harmonic oscillator functions,\nwhich are also referred to as the Gaussian beam (or ray)\nsolutions [1, 2]. The periodicity condition for the solution\ndefined by Eqs. (1), (2) and (5) is obtained from the phase\nincrement for a single round trip along the orbit, which\ndepends on the classical action S0 and the phases of the\nvarious powers of z, z in the expressions. This yields the\nBohr-Sommerfeld quantization formula for stable orbits,\u222b T\n0\na(s)ds+\u03a6 = h\u00af[2pin+ (m+ 1\/2)\u03c6(E)], (9)\nwhere \u03a6 is the magnetic flux through the orbit, while n\nandm are longitudinal and transverse quantum numbers.\nFor unstable orbits, |Tr M | > 2. In this case the\neigenvectors and eigenvalues of M are real, such that\n\u039b\u00b1 = exp(\u00b1\u03bb) where \u03bb is the dimensionless Lyapunov\nexponent (corresponding to a time-domain Lyapunov ex-\nponent \u03bbT = \u03bb\/T ). For this case the harmonic oscillator\nfunctions with integer index m in Eq. (5) violate the pe-\nriodicity condition. However, the periodicity can still be\nachieved with the choice of the \u03be = \u22121\/2 + i\u03b7 (where \u03b7\nis real). The resulting functions are similar to those for\nan inverted (negative) harmonic potential.\nThe periodicity requirement of the wave function then\nresults in the Bohr-Sommerfeld like quantization condi-\ntion for unstable trajectories\u222b T\n0\na(s)ds+\u03a6 = h\u00af[2pin\u00b1 \u03b7\u03bb(E) + pi\u03b1\/2]. (10)\nThe Maslov index \u03b1 counts singular points along the tra-\njectory, where z or z vanishes. Since \u0393 \u221d z\u22121, these\npoints produce a square-integrable singularity \u221d z\u22121\/4 in\nthe wave function [see also Eq. (13), below], which can\nbe further regularized by uniform approximations (see,\ne. g., Refs. [31, 32]).\nIV. CONTRIBUTION TO SCAR STATES\nThe ABL solutions defined by Eqs. (5) and (6) are only\nvalid in a boundary layer of width |n| = \u221ah\u00af|\u03bd| = O(\u221ah\u00af)\naround the orbit. In order to construct eigenstates as-\nsociated with the unstable trajectory, the semiclassical\nwave function has to be matched to a quasi-random back-\nground beyond this layer [26], which in principle can mix\nsolutions with different values of \u03b7 and n. The number\nof contributing solutions is defined by the interplay be-\ntween the coupling of the solutions with the background,\nand the energetics of the different states as determined\nby the quantization condition in Eq. (10). In essence, one\ntherefore deals with a scattering problem. As confirmed\nin recent works on quantum resonance wave functions\n[16, 27, 28], an important scale in this context is the\nEhrenfest time [29], defined by the time of a wavepacket\nof initial size of de Broglie wave length to spread across\nthe entire accessible phase space of the system,\ntEhr = \u03bb\n\u22121\nT lnNph. (11)\nHere \u03bbT = \u03bb\/T is the time-domain Lyapunov exponent,\nand Nph = L\n\u221a\n2mE\/h\u00af \u226b 1 is a dimensionless measure\n(in units of Planck\u2019s constant) of the total accessible vol-\nume of the phase space, where L is the characteristic size\nof the system.\nThe Ehrenfest time defines an energy window\nE = En0 \u00b1\n2pih\u00af\ntEhr\n, (12)\nover which partial ABL solutions are strongly mixed\namong each other via the background states. Here\nEn0 = En0,\u03b7=0 the characteristic energy following from\nthe Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition (10), with\n\u03b7 = 0. Earlier numerical observations provide evidence\nthat scars are quantized with energies close to En0 [24].\nThis is the energy of the symmetric separatrix solution,\n\u03c8(s, \u03bd) \u221d\n\u221a\n\u03bd\nzz\nJ\u22121\/4\n(\nw\u03bd2\n4zz\n)\ne\ni\n4\n(\u0393+\u0393\u00af)\u03bd2 . (13)\nSeparatrix solutions without trajectory-specific z and z\nwere earlier discussed in the context of scarring phe-\nnomenon as the solution of the hyperbolic fixed-point\nproblem [21, 22, 23]. The asymptotic form of Eq. (13)\nfor large \u03bd\n\u03c8(s, \u03bd) \u221d 1\u221a\n\u03bd\ncos\n(\nw\u03bd2\n4zz\n)\n, (14)\nrecovers the well known result of Bogomolny [17] (again,\ngeneralized to contain the trajectory-specific z), which is\noften interpreted as the profile of a scarred wave func-\ntion associated with few closely located unstable orbits\n[5]. We also note that the description of scars in earlier\nworks [15] employed the ABL formalism for stable orbits\ntogether with the variational procedure to minimize the\n4squared transverse energy. This effectively determines\nthe wave function closest to the separatrix solution (13),\nbut represents this as a sum of harmonic oscillator func-\ntions.\nExpanding the quantization condition (10) around\nE = En0 one obtains\nE \u2248 En0 +\n2pih\u00af\nT\n\u03b4n+ h\u00af\u03bbT \u03b7, (15)\nwhere \u03b4n = n \u2212 n0. The approximate \u2019level spacing\u2019 of\nstates with different \u03b7 can be estimated from the asymp-\ntotics of Eq. (5) at \u03bd \u2192\u221e,\n\u03c8\u03b7(s, \u03bd) \u221d 1\u221a\n\u03bd\nexp\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3i\u03932 \u03bd2 \u2212 i\u03b7 ln\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\u03bd\n\u221a\n\u0393\u2212 \u0393\n2\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\uf8fc\uf8fd\n\uf8fe .\n(16)\nAssuming that the mixing occurs when the state spreads\nto a transverse distance Ltr = O(L), the typical spacing\nof solutions with different \u03b7 is\n\u2206\u03b7 \u221d ln\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edLtr\n\u221a\n\u3008\u0393\u3009s \u2212 \u3008\u0393\u3009s\n2h\u00af\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 , (17)\nwhere \u3008\u3009s denotes averaging over the trajectory.\nUnder certain conditions, only a single solution (5) is\nfound in the Ehrenfest window (12). From the longitu-\ndinal quantization one obtains the standard condition\nT <\u223c tEhr. (18)\nThe transverse quantization gap (17) implies\nT <\u223c O(\u03bbT\u22121N \u03b6ph), (19)\nwith \u03b6 > 0 depending on the precise choice of Ltr. This\ncondition is satisfied for all T <\u223c tEhr, and therefore\nis weaker than the longitudinal quantization condition.\nConsequently, as long as the period of the orbit T is less\nthan the Ehrenfest time, only a single ABL solution will\ncontribute to the semiclassical eigenstate.\nThe arguments from the above procedure of matching\nof the ABL solution to the random background therefore\nrecovers the main phenomenological result on the strong\nscarring along unstable trajectories, Eq. (18), which was\nearlier obtained by analysis of time-dependent Gaussian\npackets [34]. Because of the conceptual relation to a scat-\ntering problem, this argumentation can be enforced by\ntaking the transverse probability flux across the scar into\naccount. This can be studied using the probability cur-\nrent in curvilinear coordinates,\nj = (js, j\u03bd) =\n(\na\u03c8\u2217\u03c8,\ni\n2\n{\n\u03c8\u03b7\u2202\u03bd\u03c8\n\u2217\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u03c8\u2217\u03b7\u2202\u03bd\u03c8\u03b7\n})\n, (20a)\n\u2202sjs + \u2202\u03bdj\u03bd = 0. (20b)\nFor truly stable orbits the wave functions are expo-\nnentially localized, resulting in a minimal leakage of the\nprobability from the orbit boundary layer. For unstable\norbits the localization is given by a power law, follow-\ning from the asymptotic expansion in Eq. (16); the ABL\nwave functions then are not square integrable, and the\nescape rate increases logarithmically with the system di-\nmensions. The symmetric separatrix solution (13) com-\nbines a large maximal value in the vicinity of the orbit\nwith a small transverse probability current. At \u03b7 < 0\nthe maximum of Eq. (5) shifts from the orbit, eventually\nmoving out of the boundary layer. At \u03b7 > 0 the trans-\nverse profile of the solution becomes flat and its weight\nshifts from the main trajectory. [Interestingly, the sepa-\nratrix solution is also best behaved in the vicinity of focal\npoints (where zz\u00af = 0); for \u03b7 6= 0 the ABL solutions dis-\nplay a jump by a factor exp(\u03b7pi).] The dominance of the\nseparatrix solution therefore has a simple physical ori-\ngin: the \u03b7-dependent term in the quantization condition\n(10) controls the transverse momentum of the solutions,\nwhich in turn determines the leakage out of the boundary\nlayer.\nV. APPLICATION TO A QUANTUM\nRESONATOR MODEL\nIn order to assess the predictive power of the above\nABL formalism for the description of individual scarred\neigenfunctions we now turn to a specific system: a two-\ndimensional strip resonator (quantum wire) in a longi-\ntudinal confinement potential and a perpendicular mag-\nnetic field B. In the x direction, the system is confined by\ntwo parallel impenetrable walls at x = 0 and x = d, while\nin the y direction the confining potential is parabolic,\nU(y) = m\u03c920y\n2\/2. In the computations we set d = 10 lB\nand \u03c90 = 2\u03c9c, where \u03c9c = |eB|\/m and lB =\n\u221a\nh\u00af\/m\u03c9c\nare the cyclotron frequency and the Landau magnetic\nlength, respectively.\nThe classical dynamics of this system is of the generic,\nmixed, type, where stable orbits coexist with unstable\norbits [see phase space portraits in the middle panels of\nFigs. 1(a)-(d)]. It was demonstrated previously for a sim-\nilar system [4] that the ABL method provides an accurate\ndescription of quantum states associated with stable or-\nbits. Here we analyze an energy-dependent family of un-\nstable bell-shaped orbits with two reflection points (0, 0)\nand (d, 0) at the hard walls [see white curves in the right\npanels of Figs. 1(a)-(d)]. The orbits consist of an upper\nand a lower arc, which are symmetrical to each other and\nare indexed in the following by i = 1, 2.\nWe solve the equation in variation (6) on each arc and\nthen link these solutions together using a reflection ma-\ntrix, which for non-vanishing magnetic field takes the\nform\nR =\n( \u22121 0\n\u22122\u03c9c tan\u0398 \u22121\n)\n, (21)\nwhere \u0398 is the angle of reflection.

The white circle in the\nHusimi representations delimits the energetically accessible region of the classical phase space.\nRM2RM1, where Mi is the fundamental matrix of arc\ni. There are eight singular points, where zz = 0: four\nwell isolated focal points around x \u2248 (0.5 \u00b1 0.15) d,\ny \u2248 \u00b10.5 d, and two pairs of closely spaced focal points\naround x \u2248 (0.5 \u00b1 0.01) d, y \u2248 \u00b10.65 d. The stretching\nfactor for the orbit (the largest eigenvalue of the mon-\nodromy matrix) is \u039b \u2248 4.6, corresponding to \u03bb \u2248 1.53.\nSemiclassically, the eigenstate is found as the sum of\nthe two separatrix solutions (13) along each arc,\n\u03a8 = \u03c81(z1, s, \u03bd) + r\u03c82(z2, s, \u03bd). (22)\nHere the coefficient r follows from the continuity condi-\ntion at the reflection points, and simply takes the value\nr = \u22121 for unstable orbits. The condition \u03a8 = 0 at\nthe boundaries x = 0 and x = d of the resonator can\nbe taken into account by adopting a mirror reflection\nmethod [1, 2]. In this method, the wave function with\nthe required boundary condition is obtained as the dif-\nference between the original solution and its mirror re-\nflection at the boundary. In principle, the presence of the\nmagnetic field requires to introduce an additional gauge\nfield to eliminate the phase jump associated to the differ-\nence \u03932 \u2212 \u03931 = 2\u03c9c entering the off-diagonal element of\nthe reflection matrix Eq. (21). However, this affects only\na small neighborhood \u221d\n\u221a\nh\u00af of the point of reflection.\nIn order to compare the resulting ABL solutions with\nexact quantum mechanics, we construct numerical eigen-\nstates in an orthogonalized basis spanned by the exact so-\nlutions of the quasi-one dimensional system without the\nhard walls, which separates in the gauge A = \u2212Byex.\nThe boundary conditions \u03a8(x = 0, d; y) = 0 are imposed\nvia a singular value decomposition (for details on such\nmethods see, e.g., Ref. [33]).\nOur numerical computations reveal that the family of\nbell-shaped unstable orbits supports a long sequence of\nscarred wavefunctions, which are found at almost equidis-\ntantly spaced energies. Four consecutive examples (with\nlongitudinal quantum numbers n = 66, 67, 68, 69) are\nshown in the left panels of Figs. 1(a)-(d). The corre-\nsponding ABL wavefunctions (right panels) accurately\ncapture the typical spatial extent of the scar signature,\nincluding the position of the focal points, where the scar\nstructure shrinks while the amplitude is significantly en-\nhanced (close to the almost-degenerate pairs of focal\n6 0\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 0  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5\n|\u03c8|\n2\nx\/d\nlayer\n(d)\nABL\nexact\nFIG. 2: Profile of the exact and semiclassical wave functions\ncalculated along the line y = 0. The width of the boundary\nlayer where the ABL approach is valid is indicated in the\nupper left corner.\npoints the wave function could be further regularized by\nadapting the general techniques of uniform approxima-\ntions; see, e.g., Refs. [31, 32]).\nThe clear correspondence between the exact quan-\ntum states and the ABL separatrix solutions is fur-\nther confirmed by the Husimi representations H(y, py) =\n|\u3008y, py|\u2202x\u03a8(x = 0, y)\u3009|2, which are obtained by over-\nlapping the derivative of the exact wavefunction at the\nleft wall with coherent states (minimal-uncertainty wave\npackets) that are parameterized in Birkhoff coordinates\ny, py. The Husimi representation, shown in the upper\nmiddle panels of Figs. 1(a)-(d), in all cases displays a\nclear maximum at the position of the bell-shaped orbit\n(red dot in the chaotic part of the phase-space portraits),\nwhich lies in the chaotic part of phase space.\nBesides the visual agreement, the separatrix solutions\nalso recover the following essential characteristics of the\nnumerical solutions: (i) The wavefunctions are of the\nright symmetry with respect to inversion around x =\n0.5 d, y = 0 (as there are eight focal points, wavefunc-\ntions are symmetric under this operation when n is odd,\nwhile they are antisymmetric when n is even). (ii) The\nprofile of the wave function along the line y = 0 extracted\nfrom the ABL and the numerical solution (after spatial\naveraging over a range of 0.05 d to eliminate the speckle\nfluctuations due to the random background in the numer-\nical solution) shows a very good agreement within valid-\nity region of the ABL solution, x\/d <\u223c 0.15. The ABL\ncaptures well both the period and the relative strength\nof the oscillations in the numerical solution. (iii) The\nexact energies are in excellent agreement with En0 , i.e.,\nthe semiclassical prediction from Eq. (10) with \u03b7 = 0.\nThese energies are almost equidistantly spaced, and the\nsemiclassical error is less than 5% of this spacing (the\nerror is also small compared to the mean level spacing\nof all states). (iv) For each longitudinal wavenumber n\nthe numerical computations only deliver a single scarred\nwavefunction localized around the unstable trajectory (in\ncontrast, many transversely excited wavefunctions are\nsupported by the stable trajectories in the island around\ny \u2248 0, py \u2248 0.3m\u03c90d). In other words, we do not find\nany other scarred states on this orbit. Therefore, the\nactual scar quantization window is reduced beyond the\nconstraint obtained by the propagation of time depen-\ndent Gaussian states [34], which predicts scarring in a\nlarger window \u2206E \u2248 h\u00af\u03bbT . However, one cannot exclude\nthat signatures of off-resonant scarring show up in the\nwavefunction statistics of the states in this larger win-\ndow, which is a question beyond our focus on individual\nwave functions.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work we extended the asymptotic bound-\nary layer (ABL) method for semiclassical wave func-\ntions, originally developed for the description of Gaus-\nsian beams guided by stable trajectories, to the case of\nscar-like states localized in the vicinity of unstable peri-\nodic orbits. We focus on wavefunctions scarred by a sin-\ngle short trajectory and derive expressions of a universal\nform, valid up to order h\u00af3\/2, which apply to general sys-\ntems which may combine hard walls, external potentials\nand magnetic fields. The ABL equations are formulated\nin a curvilinear coordinate system associated with the\nclassical trajectory. The system- and orbit-specific infor-\nmation enters via the solution of the classical equations\nin variations, which describe the stability of the trajec-\ntory. At fixed energy, the profile of the wavefunction is\ndetermined by a periodicity condition, which results in a\nBohr-Sommerfeld quantization formula.\nFar away from the guiding trajectory, the ABL wave\nfunction decays as the inverse square-root of the distance,\nand therefore is not normalizable, but couples to the\nquasi-random background of other modes in the system.\nThis coupling is the weakest for the symmetric separatrix\nstate, which is associated to a particulary simple quan-\ntization condition. Since the separatrix state is also the\nmost visibly localized ABL wavefunction, one can expect\nthat it typically provides the dominant contribution to\nscars guided by a single short trajectory. In general, we\nestimate that the number of wave functions of different\nprofile participating in the scar formation increases log-\narithmically with the system dimensions, and therefore\ndepends on the relation of the Ehrenfest time and the\nperiod of the trajectory.\nWe verified our conclusions by comparison with exact\nnumerical solution for a quantum strip resonator with the\nquadratic confining potential and a perpendicular mag-\nnetic field. In this system, a family of unstable periodic\norbits supports a long sequence of scarred states, with\nenergies in excellent agreement with the simple quanti-\nzation condition for the separatrix solution. We find that\nthis solution captures all the essential characteristics of\nthe exact scarred states. The studied system is of the\n7generic type, with a mixed phase space, which raises the\nexpectation that the ABL formalism is applicable to a\nlarge class of quantum-dynamical systems.\nAn open question concerns the generalization of the\nformalism to scars supported by many trajectories, as\nwell as the contribution of ABL solutions to off-resonant\nscars (typically revealed in wavefunction statistics).\nThis work was supported by the European Commission\nvia Marie-Curie excellence grant No. MEXT-CT-2005-\n023778.\nAPPENDIX A: ABL EXPANSION FOR\nSCHRO\u00a8DINGER EQUATION\nIn this appendix we outline the main steps in the\nderivation of the ABL formalism. Further details on the\nformalism can be found in Refs. [1, 2]. Here, we present a\nstraightforward derivation based on the direct expansion\nof the Schro\u00a8dinger equation.\nThe main trajectory r0(s), which is parameterized by\nits arclength s, generates an orthogonal coordinate sys-\ntem spanned by the normal unit vector en(s) and the\nlongitudinal unit vector et(s), which we express in the\ncomponent form\nen(s) \u2261\n(\n\u03b3x\n\u03b3y\n)\n, et(s) \u2261\n(\n\u03b3y\n\u2212\u03b3x\n)\n. (A1)\nRecalling the conversion formulas for the partial deriva-\ntives in curvilinear coordinates,\n\u2202x =\n\u03b3y\n\u03be\n\u2202s + \u03b3x\u2202n, \u2202y = \u2212\u03b3x\n\u03be\n\u2202s + \u03b3y\u2202n, (A2)\n\u03be = 1\u2212 n\n\u03c1(s)\n,\nwhere \u03c1(s) is the curvature radius of the trajectory, we\nwrite the Schro\u00a8dinger equation as\n\u03a8ss\n\u03be2\n\u2212 n\u03c1\u02d9\n\u03be3\u03c12\n\u03a8s \u2212 \u03a8n\n\u03be\u03c1\n+\u03a8nn +\nieB\nh\u00af\u03be\n[(r0en) + n] \u03a8s\n+\nieB\nh\u00af\n(r0el)\u03a8n \u2212 e\n2B\n2\n4h\u00af2\u03be3\n(r0 + enn)\n2\u03a8 =\n2m\nh\u00af2\u03be3\n(U \u2212 E)\u03a8,\n(A3)\nwhere U(s, n) is the potential inside the resonator.\nThe central idea of the ABL approach is to search the\nsolution to Eq. (A3) in an asymptotically small boundary\nlayer of the width \u221d\n\u221a\nh\u00af in the vicinity of the main trajec-\ntory. A straightforward way to derive the corresponding\nsemiclassical expansion for the wave function follows two\nsteps: (i) scaling the normal variable as n =\n\u221a\nh\u00af\u03bd and\n(ii) expanding the resulting equation in powers of\n\u221a\nh\u00af,\nas written in Eq. (1), where each term \u03c8(j) is uniquely\ndefined.\nWe substitute Eq. (1) into Eq. (A3), expand the re-\nsulting equation, and match the coefficients of the re-\nsulting series, which yields a hierarchical set of equations\nfor S0(s), S1(s), and \u03c8\n(j)(s, \u03bd). If the expansion of the ef-\nfective potential can limited to second order (a standard\nassumption in linear scar theories [9, 14]), one can termi-\nnate the series in Eq. (1) at the leading term \u03c8(0)(s, \u03bd).\nThis is equivalent to obtaining a semiclassical wave func-\ntion to the order of h\u00af3\/2 [1]. The first three terms of the\nseries expansion of Eq. (A3) read\nh\u00af\u22122 : A \u03c8(0) = 0, (A4a)\nh\u00af\u22123\/2 : A \u03c8(1) + 2iB \u03c8(0)\u03bd + C\u03bd \u03c8(0) = 0, (A4b)\nh\u00af\u22121 : C\u03bd \u03c8(1) + 2iB \u03c8(1)\u03bd +D = 0, (A4c)\nwith coefficients\nA = a2 \u2212 r\n2\n0e\n2B\n2\n4\n\u2212 eB(r0el)S1 \u2212 S21 + eB(r0en)S\u02d90 \u2212 S\u02d920 ,\n(A5a)\nB = eB\n2\n(r0el) + S1, (A5b)\nC = S\n2\n1 \u2212 S\u02d920\n\u03c1\n\u2212 2S\u02d90S\u02d91 \u2212 eBS\u02d920 \u2212 eBS\u02d91(r0en)\n\u2212 eB\n\u03c1\n(r0el)S1 \u2212 2mu1 \u2212 a\n2\n\u03c1\n+\ne2B2\n4\u03c1\nr20 \u2212\ne2B2\n2\n(r0en),\n(A5c)\nD = 2ia \u03c8\u02d9(0) + ia\u02d9 \u03c8(0) + \u03c8(0)\u03bd\u03bd \u2212 da2\u03bd2 \u03c8(0). (A5d)\nEquation (A4a) yieldsA = 0. Equation (A4b) is solved\nby setting B = 0, since C = 0 is satisfied identically if\nA = B = 0, which yields the classical action solution\n(2). Finally Eq. (A4c) is equivalent to D = 0, which\nyields Eq. (3). After the substitution \u03c6 = a\u22121\/2\u03c8(0) this\nequation take the form of a nonstationary Schro\u00a8dinger\nequation, which we write as\nL\u02c6\u03c6 \u2261\n{\ni\u2202s +\n\u22022\u03bd\n2a\n\u2212 ad\n2\n\u03bd2\n}\n\u03c6 = 0. (A6)\nThe fact that Eq. (5) is a solution to Eq. (3) can be\nchecked by a direct substitution. Here we present a direct\nderivation, which provides deeper insight into the nature\nof the ABL solution. First, we obtain a \u201cground state\u201d\nsolution to Eq. (A6) by using the ansatz\n\u03c60 = \u00b5(s) exp\n{\ni\n\u0393(s)\n2\n\u03bd2\n}\n, (A7)\nwhich is similar to the thawed Gaussians introduced by\nHeller [25] to describe the time evolution of localized\nquantum wave packets. Substituting Eq. (A7) into Eq.\n(A6) yields equations for the unknown quantities \u0393 and\n\u00b5,\n\u0393\u02d9 +\n\u03932\na\n+ ad = 0, (A8a)\n\u00b5 = exp\n{\n\u22121\n2\n\u222b s\n0\n\u0393\na\nds\n}\n. (A8b)\n8The Ricatti equation (A8a) is solved by a standard sub-\nstitution \u0393 = p\/z, after which one finds equations for\np and z as given by Eq. (6). As we mentioned above,\nthis Hamiltonian equations in variations define relative\ncoordinates z and momentum p for classical trajectories\nin the vicinity of the guiding trajectory. Once Eq. (6)\nis solved, Eq. (A8b) delivers \u00b5 = z\u22121\/2. Equation (6)\nhas two linearly independent solutions, (z, p) and (z, p),\nwhich define the constant Wronskian pz \u2212 pz = w.\nThe classical origin of Eq. (6) can be established from\nthe reduced classical action constructed for the trajec-\ntory n(s) in the vicinity of the guiding trajectory. In\ncurvilinear coordinates this action reads\nS =\n\u222b s\n0\n\u221a\n2m(E \u2212 U(r))\n{(\n1\u2212 n\n\u03c1\n)2\n+ n\u02d92\n}1\/2\nds\n+\neB\n2\n\u222b s\n0\n(xy\u02d9 \u2212 yx\u02d9) ds, (A9)\nwhere x = x0(s) + \u03b3x(s)n(s) and y = y0(s) + \u03b3y(s)n(s).\nExpanding Eq. (A9) to second order in the small quantity\nn, one obtains\nS = S0 \u2212\n\u222b s\n0\n\u03b5 n ds+\n1\n2\n\u222b s\n0\n(\nan\u02d92 \u2212 adn2) ds, (A10)\nwhere\n\u03b5(s) = eB +\na\n\u03c1\n+\nau1\n2(E \u2212 u0) . (A11)\nThe linear term in this expansion vanishes identically,\n\u03b5 = 0, because n = 0 is also a trajectory (the main tra-\njectory). The linear coefficient in Eq. (A10) is related\nto Eq. (A5c) as C = 2a\u03b5, which explains why C van-\nishes. The Euler-Lagrange equation for the action (A10)\nis equivalent to the Hamiltonian system (6).\nA sequence of partial solutions to Eq. (3) can be con-\nstructed with the help of creation and annihilation oper-\nators [1, 30]\n\u039b\u02c6 =\n\u221a\ni\nw\n(\u2212i z \u2202\u03bd \u2212 p \u03bd) , (A12a)\n\u039b\u02c6\u2020 =\n\u221a\ni\nw\n(\u2212i z \u2202\u03bd \u2212 p \u03bd) , (A12b)\nwhich satisfy the following algebra\n[\u039b\u02c6, L\u02c6] = [\u039b\u02c6\u2020, L\u02c6] = 0, [\u039b\u02c6, \u039b\u02c6\u2020] = 1. (A13)\nGeneral solutions are then obtained from \u03c8m = \u039b\n\u2020m\u03c80.\nThis procedure leads to a recurrence relation, which is\nsolved by wave functions of the explicit form\n\u03c6m(s, \u03bd) \u221d z\nm(\u0393\u2212 \u0393)m\/2\u221a\nz\nHm\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\u221a\n\u0393\u2212 \u0393\n2i\n\u03bd\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 e i2\u0393\u03bd2 ,\n(A14)\nwhere Hm are Hermite polynomials.\nThe presented derivation allows for an unambiguous\nanalytical continuation of the recurrence relation and its\nsolutions to arbitrary indices m \u2192 \u03be. This yields Eq.\n(5), where the parabolic cylinder functions D\u03be take the\nplace of the Hermite polynomials Hm, and the coefficient\na\u22121\/2 is accounted for. Finally, we note that recalling the\ndefinition of \u0393 and \u0393 as well as that for the Wronskian,\nthe solution can be compactly written as\n\u03c6\u03be(s, \u03bd) \u221d e\ni\n4\n(\u0393+\u0393)\u03bd2\n\u221a\nz\n(\nz\nz\n)\u03be\/2\nD\u03be\n(\u221a\nw\nizz\n\u03bd\n)\n.
