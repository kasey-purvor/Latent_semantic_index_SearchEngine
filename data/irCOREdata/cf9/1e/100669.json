INTRODUCTION\nControversy continues over whether 8B is a proton-halo\nnucleus. Several pieces of evidence\u2014including its large\nquadrupole moment [1], enhanced reaction cross sections sR\nat sub-Coulomb [2] and medium bombarding energies [3,4],\nmomentum distributions of the 7Be fragments following\nbreakup [5,6], and the asymptotic normalization coefficient\n(ANC) for proton transfer in the peripheral s7Be,8Bd reaction\n[7]\u2014argue for such a halo. Moreover, proton-removal mea-\nsurements at relativistic energies [8] quantify the excited\ncore component in the 8B ground-state wave function and\nestablish the dominance of the 1p proton configuration.\nHowever, the lack of enhancement in the high-energy inter-\naction cross sections sI [9] argues against a halo. Further-\nmore, polarization of the 7Be core can enhance the 8B quad-\nrupole moment [10], while the 7Be fragment momentum\ndistributions are modified by the reaction mechanism and\ntherefore do not directly measure the valence proton\nmomentum-space wave function [11].\nNucleon-removal cross sections, s1p in the case of 8B, are\nimportant for an understanding of the structure of halo nuclei\nsince they are sensitive to details of the single-particle wave\nfunction in the nuclear surface [12]. In contrast, contribu-\ntions to sR and sI come from the many-body wave function\nthroughout the entire nuclear volume, and are less sensitive\nto the halo-defining surface region. This paper reports s1p\ndata for 20\u201360 MeV\/nucleon 8B projectiles incident on a Si\ntarget. These data are compared with two older inclusive data\nsets [4,13] and with the predictions of the shell model by the\nuse of an effective three-body reaction model [14,15]. Our\ndata span a larger energy range than the older data and thus\ntest more effectively the predicted energy dependence. The\nnew data result from additional analysis of earlier measure-\nments [3] of sR for 8B on Si. We show that the Si target-\ndetector telescope of that experiment\u2014hereafter called Ex-\nperiment 1\u2014also is well suited to measuring the energy\ndependence of s1p for light projectiles at bombarding ener-\ngies up to about 70 MeV\/nucleon.\nThere are few available data for the nucleus 9C. Its un-\nusually small 2p-separation energy s1.43 MeVd is only\nslightly larger than that of 17Nes0.94 MeVd which has been\nproposed as a 2p-halo nucleus because of its anomalously\nlarge sI at high energy [16]. Single-proton removal from 9C\nleaves the weakly bound nucleus 8B, in contrast to 17Ne\nwhich would be left as the unbound nucleus 16F. The sxp of\n9C are therefore possible indicators of its structure. An inter-\nesting aspect of nucleon removal is that, when single-\nnucleon removal leaves a halo or other weakly bound\nnucleus, the cross section for removing two nucleons can\nexceed that for removing only one nucleon. This effect was\nobserved for neutron removal from 12Be at 50 MeV\/nucleon\n[17] and proton removal from 9C at 75 MeV\/nucleon [18]\nand at 285 MeV\/nucleon [19]. Finally, the small binding en-\nergy of the last proton allows the astrophysically important\nANC for the p+ 8B system to be extracted from proton-\nremoval data [20]. We report here values of s1p and s2p for\n30\u201350 MeV\/nucleon 9C on Si. These were obtained from a\nlater experiment [21]\u2014hereafter called Experiment\n2\u2014which also employed a Si telescope for sR measure-\nments.\n*Present address: INFN-LNS, Via S.

This well-\nbound nucleus is interesting to contrast with 8B since, at\nenergies above 200 MeV\/nucleon, the measured values of\ns1p for 12C are only about half those predicted using the shell\nmodel and eikonal reaction theory [22]. Similar reductions,\nor quenching of the predicted shell model single-particle\nstrength, have been observed in analyses of se ,e8pd knockout\nreaction data.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nThe measurements of Experiment 1, for 8B, 9C, and 12C\non Si, are described in this Section. A brief summary of\nExperiment 2, which produced most of our 9C data, is in-\ncluded in Sec. III.\nThe three projectiles used in this study were produced as\nsecondary beams by fragmentation of a primary\n80 MeV\/nucleon 18O beam at the National Superconducting\nCyclotron Laboratory. The targets for the primary beam were\n0.5 g\/cm2 Be for 8B and 9C, and 0.6 g\/cm2 C for 12C. Both\n8B and 9C were components of a compound secondary beam\nwhich initially contained about 70% 7Be and little 9C; later\nadjustment of the magnetic analyzing system not only de-\ncreased the 7Be content to about 20% but increased the 9C\ncontent.\nThese secondary beams were transmitted through the\nA1200 analyzing system [23] and delivered to the reaction\nproduct mass separator (RPMS) [24] which refined the ve-\nlocity and momentum selections.\nAfter leaving the RPMS, the secondary projectiles passed\nthrough two position-sensitive parallel-plate avalanche\ncounters (PPAC\u2019s), 1.3 m apart, which measured their coor-\ndinates in the plane normal to the beam axis. The remaining\ntelescope elements (see inset to Fig. 1) were 11 Si transmis-\nsion detectors of 300 or 450 mm2 active area; these served as\nboth targets for the projectiles and detectors of the fragments.\nThey were arranged so that each of five detectors of about\n0.1 mm depletion depth (called D1 through D5) was fol-\nlowed by a 1 mm thick detector (E1 through E5). A 0.4 mm\ndetector (E6) completed the telescope.\nProjectiles accepted for analysis had appropriate time of\nflight to, and energy loss in, detector D1, and traveled within\n5 mm of the telescope axis, as determined from the PPAC\nsignals. Fragments were identified from scatter plots, such as\nFig. 1, for the last two detectors E5 and E6. This plot shows\nboth 7Be fragments produced in the telescope and some\nstraggling unreacted 8B\u2019s. However, most unreacted 8B\u2019s\nstopped in detector E5, since their average range [25] was\n5.50 mm and the first ten detectors had a combined thickness\nof 5.65 mm. Most of the 7Be fragments produced in or be-\nfore detector E4 (but few from E5) reached detector E6, and\ntherefore were easily distinguished from 8B. Some fragments\nstopped in detector E6 but others were transmitted through it.\nEvents in Fig. 1 below and to the left of the 7Be\u2019s are ex-\npected to be primarily 3He and 4He. A few transmitted 6Li\nfragments were identified in the D5 vs E5 spectrum; these\nevents were removed from Fig. 1 and other analyzed spectra.\nHowever, we cannot estimate s2p for 8B, since the most\nenergetic (i.e., least ionizing) 6Li fragments could not be\nresolved from the Z=2 group.\nIII. DATA ANALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA. 8B\nIdentified 8B\u2019s, in a secondary beam of 5 mm radius, pro-\nduced 7Be fragments in the Si detector targets. These frag-\nments were sorted into four production energy intervals; viz.,\nthe ranges of the projectile energies as they passed through\ndetectors E1 through E4. This sorting required an additional\ntwo-dimensional identification gate\u2014containing only those\n7Be events appearing in Fig. 1\u2014which was applied to the\nenergy spectra of the 0.1 mm detectors D2 through D5.\nThese spectra, shown in Fig. 2, cleanly separate the 8B\u2019s\nFIG. 1. A scatter plot for the last two elements of the Si target-\ndetector telescope (shown in inset) used in Experiment 1. The inci-\ndent secondary beam is 62 MeV\/nucleon 8B.\nFIG. 2. Energy loss spectra in four thin detectors (see Fig. 1)\nfrom incident 8B, gated on the 7Be fragments identified in detectors\nE5 and E6.\nR. E. WARNER et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024612 (2004)\n024612-2\nwhich have not yet reacted from the 7Be\u2019s already produced;\nthe latter steadily increase downstream in the telescope while\nthe former decrease. Since projectile selection is completed\nin detector D1, 7Be events observed in detector D3 (for ex-\nample) were produced in detectors E1, D2, and E2. The E\ndetectors produce about ten times as many fragments as the\nD detectors because of their greater thickness; the few events\nbetween the 7Be and 8B groups in Fig. 2 are from fragmen-\ntation in the specified D detector. Since the ionization losses\nin the detectors vary with projectile energy, the horizontal\nscales in Fig. 2 are separately renormalized to align the 8B\npeaks.\nWe determined s1p for each energy interval from the in-\ncrease in the number of 7Be fragments observed in the D\ndetector following that interval\u2019s E detector over those in the\none preceding it, the number of accepted projectiles, and the\neffective target thickness. For the highest-energy interval the\ntight energy gate set on detector D1 rejected all but a negli-\ngible number of fragments produced in it, so the target thick-\nness was taken to be that of the E1 detector plus half that of\nD2. In the other three cases, the effective thickness was taken\nto be that of the corresponding E detector plus half of the\nadjacent D detectors. Corrections were made for reactions\nwhich attenuated the 8B beam in the telescope, and for sec-\nondary reactions of the fragments which prevented their\nidentification. These effects were calculated from the known\nreaction cross sections of 7Be and 8B in Si [3,17]; together\nthey increased s1p by about 5%. Two roughly equal back-\nground estimates\u2014about 2% of the total counts\u2014were ob-\ntained from the event rate outside the peaks in Fig. 2, and\nfrom other D2 through D5 spectra gated on events from areas\nadjacent to the 7Be events in Fig. 1. Experimental uncertain-\nties were obtained by combining in quadrature the statistics\nof total and background events with an additional 5% esti-\nmate for the uncertainty in specifying the two-dimensional\nidentification gate.\nFurther corrections to s1p would have been required if the\nmomentum distribution of the fragments in the projectile rest\nframe had caused some fragments with large transverse mo-\nmenta to scatter out of the telescope or others with large\nbackward longitudinal momenta to have insufficient range to\nreach detector E6. Such losses are negligible if we assume a\nGaussian distribution with a rest-frame full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) of 90 MeV\/c, the value reported for 8B\non a Be target [11]. In contrast, a Lorentzian distribution [26]\nimplies substantial corrections: e.g., 8% of the fragments\nproduced in detector E1 are predicted to stop in detector E5.\nHowever, since none were observed to do so, we made no\nsuch corrections.\nOur cross sections s1p for 8B are shown in Fig. 3 and\nTable I. Their individual error bars overlap those of the other\nlow-energy data [4,13] except for the points near\n60 MeV\/nucleon. However, as a group, the present data\nshow the decrease of s1p with increasing energy predicted by\ntheory, while the older data were consistent with energy in-\ndependence.\nB. 9C\nWe first summarize Experiment 2, more fully described\nelsewhere [21], and then present the 9C results obtained from\nit. Two thin position-sensitive Si detectors, E1 and E2, se-\nlected a 55 MeV\/nucleon 9C secondary beam of 4 mm ra-\ndius. The four detector targets, E3 through E6, were 0.5 mm\nthick. The 7Be and 8B fragments which they produced were\nidentified in detectors E7 and E8, 0.5 mm and 5 mm thick\nrespectively, using the empirical range-energy relationship\nR=aEp [17]. The energy loss spectra in detector E6 for these\nidentified fragments are shown in Fig. 4. Each spectrum has\na lower peak, caused mainly by fragments produced in de-\ntectors E3 through E5, and an upper peak (labeled \u201c9C\u201d)\nfrom fragments produced in E7 near its front face. The con-\ntinuum between these peaks is from fragments produced in\nFIG. 3. Inclusive s1p for 8B incident on Al or Si. Measurements\nare from the present work and Refs. [4,13,19].

To confine the production region to detectors E3 through\nE6, events above the cutoff energy shown in Fig. 4 were\nrejected, leaving 234 and 82 accepted 7Be and 8B events,\nrespectively.\nThe measured proton-removal cross sections for Experi-\nment 2 (projectile energies between 28 and\n51 MeV\/nucleon) are listed in Table I. These values include\nbeam and fragment attenuation corrections of about 2%. For\nthese corrections we assumed sR for 7Be, 8B, and 9C on Si to\nbe 1.6\u00b10.4 b; this range covers all measured sR\u2019s for light\nnuclei on Si at these energies [3,17]. Correcting for rejected\nfragments produced near the rear face of E6 (i.e., above the\ncutoff energy in Fig. 4) requires the rest-frame fragment mo-\nmentum distribution. The Goldhaber model [27] gives a\n1p-FWHM of about 240 MeV\/c for stable nuclei, and (for\n9C) a 2p FWHM which is \u02db7\/4 times as large. The 1p\nFWHM of 9C was chosen to be 150 MeV\/c since its\nSps1.3 MeVd is between those of 8Bs0.137 MeVd and nor-\nmally bound nuclei s,8 MeVd. This correction then added\n9% and 5% to the 1p and 2p yields, respectively, while the\nother momentum-distribution corrections (for out-scattering\nand insufficient range) were negligible. Backgrounds of 8\n(14) events for 7Bes8Bd were subtracted after being observed\nin E6 spectra gated on particle-identification signals between\nand outside the peaks for 7Be and 8B fragments.\nIn Experiment 1, about 33104 9C projectiles of\n69 MeV\/nucleon met the acceptance criteria for beam\nspread (5 mm radius), timing, and energy loss in detector\nD1. Only those fragments produced in detectors E1 through\nE3 and identified in the D2 through D4 energy spectra were\ncounted, since many produced in E4 stopped before E6. The\nscatter plot for the two final detectors, Fig. 5, shows stopped\nand transmitted groups for both 7Be and 8B fragments,\nwhose identities were confirmed from their signals in D4 and\nD5. The plot shows no long-range straggling 9C\u2019s, as is ex-\npected since these projectiles have 0.15 mm less range in Si\nthan the 8B projectiles.\nThe value of s1p measured in Experiment 1 (projectile\nenergies from 40 to 68 MeV\/nucleon) is listed in Table I.\nThis value of s1p includes a 9\u00b14 % correction for out-\nscattering, range distribution, and beam and fragment attenu-\nation. There are 60 7Be events and 34 8B events identified in\nFig. 5. Their ratio, 1.76\u00b10.38, is probably a lower limit since\nsome 7Be events appear to be lost among the Z=2,3 events\nnear the origin of Fig. 5. This count ratio is marginally con-\nsistent with the s2p \/s1p ratio of 2.57\u00b10.42 found in Experi-\nment 2. This cross section ratio is consistent with those\nfound at 285 MeV\/nucleon [19], which also suggest that the\nratio is target dependent.\nC. 12C\nThe scatter plot for incident 59 MeV\/nucleon 12C was\nsimilar to that for 8B shown in Fig. 1. A prominent 12C\nstraggling group was well resolved from a thin locus for\nstopped 11B fragments, which were outnumbered by trans-\nmitted 11B\u2019s. The latter were well resolved from Be events\nfrom 2p removal.\nYields of 11B fragments from incident 12C were obtained\nas were those of 7Be from incident 8B. Since the Goldhaber\nmodel [27] indicated momentum-distribution losses near\n20% for fragments produced in E4, we report data only for\ndetectors E1 through E3, for which these corrections were\nbelow 5%. Our measured s1p for 12C on Si, presented in\nTable I, are comparable to those observed in 12C+ 12C at\nhigher energies [22].\nIV.

These values are consistent\n[22] with the recent direct measurement of this Ip=1\/2\u2212\ncomponent obtained at the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenfor-\nschung [8]. The proton separation energies to the ground and\nexcited state are 0.1375 MeV and 0.5665 MeV, respectively.\nWe assume that a central Woods-Saxon potential binds the\nprotons in each single-particle configuration, with the poten-\ntial depth adjusted to reproduce the required separation en-\nergy. The potential geometry was taken from Ref. [29], as\nused in Ref. [22], with radius parameter r0=1.254 fm and\ndiffuseness a=0.62 fm, consistent with the Coulomb dis-\nplacement energy for the A=7 system. Thus the effective 7Be\nground- and 1\/2\u2212-state spectroscopic factors are Sc.m.s3\/2\u2212d\n=8s0.97+0.06d \/7=1.18 and Sc.m.s1\/2\u2212d=8s0.22d \/7=0.25,\nrespectively.\nThe 7Be-target elastic profile functions S7sbd, and all sub-\nsequent residue-target profile functions, were calculated at all\nenergies assuming the optical limit of the eikonal model [31].\nThus the assumed 7Be and target one-body densities were\n(double) folded with an effective nucleon-nucleon (NN) in-\nteraction. This NN interaction was assumed to have zero\nrange. The free NN cross sections were computed from the\nformulas of Charagi and Gupta [32]. Their real to imaginary\npart ratios were interpolated from the tabulation of Ray [33]\nfor E\u00f8100 MeV\/nucleon and were set to the 100 MeV val-\nues for E,100 MeV\/nucleon. The 7Be matter density was\nassumed to be Gaussian with a root mean squared (rms) ra-\ndius of 2.31 fm [34]. The target (Si) density was assumed to\nbe given by the global Fermi form parametrization of Negele\n[35], from which the rms matter radius is 3.165 fm. The\ncalculated 7Be-Si elastic profile functions are highly absorp-\ntive at all energies and there is very little sensitivity to these\nparameters in the calculations.\nThis optical limit approach is not appropriate, however,\nfor the proton-target profile function Spsbd at the lowest en-\nergies we consider here. For all the lower-energy calcula-\ntions, E\u014280 MeV\/nucleon, we used the proton-target pro-\nfile functions calculated using the exact continued phases\nmethod [36], in which the exact partial wave S matrix was\nanalytically continued for noninteger orbital angular mo-\nmenta l=kb\u22121\/2. These improved Spsbd were computed\nfrom the proton-target optical potential calculated using the\nmidpoint local density approximation [37] and the Jeukenne,\nLejeunne, and Mahaux (JLM) effective NN interaction [38].\nIn calculating this potential we included the required effec-\ntive mass correction to the imaginary part (Eq. (29) of [38])\ndiscussed in Refs. [39,40]. We used the conventional scale\nfactors for the real and imaginary parts of the JLM optical\npotentials, lV=1.0 and lW=0.8, required to fit a body of\nelastic scattering and reaction cross section data [37] for light\nand medium mass targets. For energies above\n80 MeV\/nucleon we used the optical limit approximation for\nSpsbd using the same effective interactions as were discussed\nfor the 7Be - target system.\nThe predictions for projectile energies from 20 to\n400 MeV\/nucleon are presented in Fig. 3. Inclusive mea-\nsurements at higher energies are generally smaller than the\ntheoretical predictions for 8B by a quenching factor Rs\n=0.88\u00b10.04 [22]. This factor, attributed to short-range, clus-\nter, and other correlation effects [41], is thought to be close\nto unity since 8B is primarily 7Be+ p in nature. Most of the\nlow-energy 8B data are also well fitted when this factor is\napplied to the predictions of Eq. (2), as is shown by the\ndashed curve of Fig. 3.\nFor improved statistical accuracy we have averaged the\nmeasured s1p over all four energy ranges. The predicted\nenergy-averaged cross section is then defined by [17]\ns1p =E fs1psEd\/sdE\/dxdgdEYE f1\/sdE\/dxdgdE . s2d\nThe weighting allows for the projectile\u2019s encountering pro-\ngressively thinner target elements per unit energy loss as it\nslows down. Comparing the measured value, 233\u00b112 mb,\nwith the prediction of 261 mb ssee Table Id yields a\nquenching factor Rs=0.89\u00b10.05. This agrees very well\nwith both the high-energy value 0.88\u00b10.05 f22g and also\nthe value 0.86\u00b10.07 recently reported for 8B+ 12C at\n76 MeV\/nucleon f18g.\nB. Calculations for 9C\nThe total spectroscopic strength for proton removal from\n9C to the 2+ 8B ground state is Ss2+,1d=0.94, with contribu-\nPROTON REMOVAL FROM 8B, 9C, AND 12C ON Si\u0085 PHYSICAL REVIEW C 69, 024612 (2004)\n024612-5\ntions of 0.93 and 0.01 from the jp= p3\/2 and p1\/2 proton con-\nfigurations, respectively [42]. Thus the effective 8B ground-\nstate spectroscopic factor is Sc.m.s2+,1d=9s0.94d \/8=1.06.\nThe proton separation energy in this case is 1.296 MeV. The\nsame central Woods-Saxon binding potential geometry was\nassumed as for the 8B case [29]. Calculation of the 8B-target\nelastic profile functions follow that for 7Be, above, with an\nassumed 8B rms matter radius of 2.38 fm. A radial mismatch\nfactor M =0.976, discussed in Ref. [43], and which accounts\nfor the difference of the last proton\u2019s orbital in 8B from that\noccupied in 9C, was also included as a scaling factor on the\ncalculated cross sections; see also Ref. [18]. All calculations\nuse the JLM effective interaction for the proton-target sys-\ntem.\nOur s1p values measured in the two experiments are given\nin Table I. Comparing them with theoretical predictions\nyields Rs=0.82\u00b10.16 for Experiment 1 s40\u201368\nMeV\/nucleond and Rs=0.65\u00b10.09 for Experiment 2\ns28\u201351 MeV\/nucleond. The weighted average of these val-\nues is 0.69\u00b10.08, which marginally agrees with the value\n0.82\u00b10.06 recently reported for 78 MeV\/nucleon 9C on a\ncarbon target [18]. More data on other targets would be\nneeded to establish a target dependence, though it is interest-\ning that the ratio of s2p to s1p seems to fall with increasing\ntarget mass [19].\nC. Calculations for 12C\nFrom the point of view of structure input, our calculations\nfor 12C follow closely those of Ref. [22]. As discussed there,\nthe p3\/2-subshell spectroscopic sum rule (of 4) is essentially\nexhausted for proton removal to just three bound final states\nof 11B, the 3\/2\u2212 ground state with Ss 32\n\u2212\n,1d=3.16, the\n1\/2\u2212s2.125 MeVd state with Ss 12\n\u2212\n,1d=0.58, and the\n3\/2\u2212s5.020 MeVd state with Ss 32\n\u2212\n,1d=0.19. The ground-state\nproton separation energy in this case is large, 15.95 MeV,\nand the binding potential geometry assumed was r0\n=1.310 fm and a=0.55 fm, as in Ref. [22].\nThe present reaction calculations differ from those of Ref.\n[22] in three respects. The first is, as for 8B and 9C, at these\nlower energies we use the JLM effective interaction for the\nproton-target system. The second is that, because of the\nhigher Z target and the lower incident energy, we include the\ncorrection of Vitturi and Zardi [44] to the projectile\u2019s impact\nparameter, b8= sh+\u02dbh2+k2b2d \/k, to take account of the\nsmall Coulomb deflection from the eikonal straight line\npaths. This pushes the projectile to larger distances of closest\napproach and so reduces the cross section slightly; but this is\neverywhere less than 4%.\nThe third and more important consideration is the as-\nsumed rms matter radius of the 11B core or residue. It was\nfound that, at these lower energies, and due to the less ab-\nsorptive nature of the JLM proton-target interaction, our cal-\nculated proton-removal cross sections show much greater\nsensitivity to the assumed core matter radius. In Ref. [22] the\nvalue of 2.11 fm was assumed, the mean of the values\n2.09 fm s11Bd and 2.12 fm s11Cd deduced from\ninteraction cross section analyses [34]. However, this value\nis anomalously small when compared to the neighboring bo-\nron isotopes, 2.20 fm s10Bd and 2.39 fm s12Bd, with mean\n2.30 fm. Also, structurally, there is no apparent basis for this\nreduced value for 11B. The SKX Skyrme-Hartree-Fock den-\nsities of Brown et al. [45] agree very well with the system-\natics of both interaction cross section and charge radii mea-\nsurements, and suggest an rms matter radius of\n2.33\u00b10.03 fm for the 11B and 11C isobars [46]. We use this\nvalue for our comparisons with the data in Table I. For in-\nformation, if we assumed a 11B rms radius of 2.11 fm and\nalso neglected the Coulomb impact parameter correction, the\n12C entries in Table I would be 213, 200, 186, and 202 mb,\nrespectively.\nOur final calculations and the data, from 34 to\n59 MeV\/nucleon, are presented in Table I. The experimental\ndata and theoretical predictions, averaged over this complete\nenergy range, yield an Rs of 0.44\u00b10.03. The higher-energy\nvalue of Rs [22], deduced from data above 1 GeV\/nucleon,\nwas 0.53\u00b10.02 for a 12C target. Additional data at other en-\nergies and with lower uncertainties would allow for a more\nrigorous comparison in this very important test case.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe method of Experiment 1, using alternating thin and\nthick Si detectors, was designed for measuring reaction cross\nsections sR on a Si target. However, we have shown that it is\nalso effective for measuring the energy dependence of\ncharge-removal cross sections. In particular, our measure-\nments show significant energy dependence for s1p of the\nweakly bound nucleus 8B but not the strongly bound 12C.\nOur shell model calculations, with eikonal reaction theory,\nproduce results for s1p of the weakly bound nuclei 8B and\n9C, consistent with those at higher energies. They require\nquenching factors Rs close to unity at all energies. The 12C\ncross section data of this work are significantly quenched\nrelative to the values predicted using eikonal reaction theory\nand shell model spectroscopy, as was also found in the inter-\npretation of higher-energy data [22]. Sensitivity to the as-\nsumed core matter radius was found in this well-bound-\nproton, lower-energy regime. Further experimental studies,\nparticularly in the region from 60 to 300 MeV\/nucleon, are\nnow needed for all these systems to provide a more definitive\ntest of the theory and for delineating the source of the ob-\nserved quenching.\nThe very large s2p observed for 9C, comparable to s1p for\n8B, suggests consideration of this nucleus as a two-proton-\nhalo candidate. Further measurements of its sxp on other\ntargets, as well as of sR and the fragment momentum distri-\nbutions, will provide more insight into the structure of this\nnucleus.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Peter Schwandt, Brad Sherrill, Christine\nCarpenter, Jon Kruse, Ashok Muthukrishnan, and Jing Wang\nfor assistance with the measurements reported here.
