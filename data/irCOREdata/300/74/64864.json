Police and civilian components\nwere further added to established so-called multifunctional missions deployed in\npost-conflict situations,3 to deal with peace-building mandates. These missions\nand their staff operate in very complex situations and in circumstances where\nthe law applicable by and to the staff employed in operations is not always very\nclear, and an \u2018emerging legal regime\u2019 seems to be developing.4\nA number of acts of misconduct, concerning sex-related abuses and ordinary\ncrimes,5 committed in the areas of international intervention, have attracted the\ninterest of the international community.6 They involve military, police and civil-\nian international personnel working for IOs, and for non-governmental organi-\nzations (NGOs) delivering humanitarian support. This problem raises very\nimportant questions for the credibility of PKOs, particularly with regard to local\npopulations, and the possible negative effects on the work of the international\ncommunity.\nThe problems discussed in this article also consider the relationship between\ninternational sets of laws including immunities, individual responsibility and pos-\nsible means to ensure accountability in the case of abuses committed by peace-\nkeepers. The issues are part of a wider UN reflection on the structure and\nfunctioning of peacekeeping missions. Since the adoption of the 2000 Brahimi\nReport,7 they are part of the reform strategy, called Peace Operations 2010,8 ad-\ndressing issues of personnel, doctrine, partnerships, resources and organization\nof PKOs.\nThere are problems of criminal prosecution at the international level, taking\ninto account the functional immunities of UN personnel and the possible lack of\ncooperation by some States in providing support to prosecute their personnel\ninvolved in PKOs abroad. The main attention is on abuses affecting the local\npopulation concerning forms of violation of International Human Rights Law\n(IHRL) and other misconduct. For this reason, issues related to International\nHumanitarian Law (IHL), as the law regulating the conduct of hostilities shall\nbe mentioned briefly to discuss their relevance in this context.\n3 See ND White and D Klaasen (eds), The UN, Human Rights and Post-Conflict\nSituations (Manchester UP, Manchester 2005).\n4 White and Klaasen (n 3) 1.\n5 S Chun, Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by UN Peacekeepers (International Peace\nResearch Institute, Oslo 2009).\n6 See KM Jennings and V Nikoli\u0107-Ristanovi\u0107, \u2018UN Peacekeeping Economies and Local\nSex Industries: Connections and Implications\u2019 (MICROCON Research Working\nPaper 17 2009).\n7 UN \u2018Report of the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations\u2019 S\/2000\/809 (2000) 39\nILM 1432; see ND White, \u2018Commentary on the Report of the Panel on UN Peace\nOperations (The Brahimi Report)\u2019 (2001) 6 JCSL 127; C Gray, \u2018Peacekeeping After\nthe Brahimi Report: Is There a Crisis of Credibility for the UN?\u2019 (2001) 6 JCSL 267.\n8 UN Doc A\/60\/696 (24 February 2006) para 6.\n2 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nApart from denunciation by NGOs and newspapers, there is an emerging\nliterature on this subject that deserves a certain attention,9 as there are com-\nplex issues involved in the legal discussion of the topic. The present article will\nfocus on the work of the UN in dealing with accountability for crimes commit-\nted by peacekeepers and staff working under a UN mandate. The basis for this\nanalysis will be the 2005 Report by Prince Zeid,10 which identified a series of\nrelevant issues and suggested possible solutions. Legal issues will be looked at\nthrough the lens of the report taking into consideration also doctrinal, State\nand UN practice. This will lead to the discussion of several legal problems\nregarding appropriate responses to the urgent questions concerning the ac-\ncountability for human rights abuses and serious misconduct by peacekeepers.\nFurthermore, this article tries to clarify the legal basis and frameworks under\nwhich the misconduct of peacekeepers should be constructed under existing\nlaw.\n9 CE Sweetser, \u2018Providing Effective Remedies to Victims of Abuse by Peacekeeping\nPersonnel\u2019 (2008) 83 New York University L Rev 1643; F Rawski, \u2018To Waive or Not\nTo Waive: Immunity and Accountability in U.N.

The Prince Zeid Report and the Nature of Crimes\nViolations committed by military and civilian components of PKOs have been\naddressed only rather recently,11 while the history of PKOs dates back to the\n1950s. They have been publicly denounced by NGOs that operate very closely\nto UN missions in the field.12 In 1999, Human Rights Watch criticized forms of\nsexual exploitation in refugee camps, including several cases of child prostitution\ninvolving humanitarian organizations\u2019 workers in Guinea.13 In 2001, the United\nNations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and Save the Children iden-\ntified cases of violations of women\u2019s rights in refugee camps committed by UN\npersonnel, humanitarian operators and NGO staff in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra\nLeone.14 The subsequent report by the UN Secretary-General15 recognized that\nforty-three alleged cases of violations of fundamental rights had been verified by\nthe investigation commission established by the UN.16 All cases included forms\nof sexual abuse committed in refugee camps,17 particularly against women. The\nvictims were generally girls aged between 13 and 18 years and perpetrators were\nmembers of the civilian and military personnel employed by international\nagencies.\nA second set of violations emerged in 2004 in the context of the UN mission in\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC).18 Out of seventy-two reported\ncases against civilian and military personnel, only twenty were considered and\nsix cases were confirmed.19 The violations included sexual abuse and child porn-\nography, but the consequences were very limited for the staff involved. A UN\nFrench civil servant was repatriated, the military personnel were denounced to\ntheir national authorities and repatriated.

The Measures Proposed and Adopted\nOn the basis of the above-mentioned reports and documents,59 the GA envisaged\nboth short-term and long-term measures. The first type of measure is provided in\ntwo resolutions,60 which should be considered together and include:\n(i) extension of the criminal jurisdiction of Member States for crimes\ncommitted outside their territory by their nationals, officials and experts\nfrom the UN peace missions,\n(ii) cooperation among UNMember States and between them and the UN to\npursue the perpetrators of relevant crimes,\n(iii) judicial assistance in legal proceedings, criminal prosecution and extradi-\ntion for the aforementioned crimes,\n(iv) cooperation, pursuant to the national legislation of Member States, in\nexchange of information and transmission of evidence gathered by the UN\nin the territory of the Member States which have begun a procedure of\nprosecution,\n(v) granting, in accordance with national legislation, effective protection\nagainst crimes committed by officials abroad, and\n(vi) granting of technical assistance to the State which welcomes the peace\nmission and on whose territory the crime was committed.\nThe text underlines the need for the UN and its Member States to take urgent,\nvigorous and effective measures. They include measures that would ensure that\noffences committed by UN officials and experts in missions do not go unpun-\nished, that their authors are brought to justice in accordance with international\nlaw standards, and to ascertain their jurisdiction in the case of serious offences\ncommitted by their nationals while acting under UN mandate.\nThe resolutions suggest developing better cooperation between the UN and\nMember States, with regard to the exchange of information and evidence in\nthe investigation of such crimes. To evaluate the progress in this matter, the\nUN Secretary-General is asked to provide a report on the basis of the informa-\ntion sent by Member States,61 including the number and types of serious allega-\ntions, and any measures taken by the UN and the Member States.62 Among\nrelevant developments to implement UN resolutions, it is important to consider\nthe adoption, by the GA, of a revised Model MoU in 2007;63 and since 2005 the\ncreation of a Conduct and Discipline Unit at the Department of Peacekeeping\n59 In particular the two reports and draft resolutions drawn up by the Sixth Commission,\nUN Docs A\/62\/448 (2007) and A\/63\/437 (2008).\n60 UNGA Res 62\/63 (8 January 2008); and Res 63\/119 (15 January 2009).\n61 UN Doc A\/RES\/63\/119 (15 January 2009) para 15.\n62 Ibid para 16.\n63 UNGA \u2018Revised Draft Model Memorandum of Understanding\u2019 (12 June 2007) UN\nDoc A\/61\/19 (Part III) annex.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 9\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nOperation (DPKO) Headquarters and operating in several missions,64 with the\ntask of receiving and assessing sexual abuse complaints.\nB. The Draft Convention\nAmong the long-term measures, a project for a new convention represents a pos-\nsible development in the international legal framework, and a way to provide\nbetter coordination for both States and organizations involved.65 The project\nis under consideration by the Working Group of the Sixth Committee, which\nshould take into account the views of Member States and the information pre-\nsented in the 2007 Note of the Secretariat.66 In that Note, the Secretary-General\npointed out that a treaty could enable UN Member States to clarify their com-\npetence to investigate and deal with cases of UN officials and experts responsible\nfor human rights violations.\nRegarding the competence rationae personae, the \u2018officials of the Organization\nof the United Nations\u2019 would include also UN volunteers, who are treated as\nofficials under the Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs).67 The \u2018experts on mis-\nsion\u2019 would include military observers, members of the police, civilians and other\npeople of expert status on mission. However, under the existing proposal, mili-\ntary personnel would be excluded from the jurisdiction of the Draft Conven-\ntion.68 They would still be under the \u2018exclusive\u2019 jurisdictions of the TCC.\nRegarding the application ratione materiae the Draft Convention would apply\nto serious offences against persons, including serious sexual abuse, rape and\nacts of sexual violence, and murder.69 Issues related to the exercise of jurisdic-\ntion are also addressed, as they need further clarification for the proper inves-\ntigation and prosecution of criminal acts. These provisions have been further\ndiscussed in subsequent documents, and they will be analysed in the following\nparts of this article.\n4. Rules Governing Peacekeeping Operations\nThe definition of the applicable legal regimes is relevant for the classification\nand prosecution of certain crimes. However, the UN documents under consid-\neration do not clarify these issues properly. Recent literature also does not\n64 See UN Doc A\/61\/957 (15 June 2007) para 22.\n65 Ibid para 8.\n66 UNGA, \u2018Note by the Secretariat: Criminal Accountability of United Nations Officials\nand Experts on mission\u2019 (11 September 2007) UN Doc A\/62\/329.\n67 See s 4.B below.\n68 2006 Draft Convention (n 44) art 2.\n69 Ibid art 3.\n10 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nfully address this issue. It is impossible here to engage in the definition of the\ngeneral law applicable to PKOs,70 but it is relevant to turn the attention to\nsome legal issues that are directly relevant when dealing with crimes commit-\nted by peacekeepers, to identify the legal basis for their prosecution. The docu-\nments adopted by the UN on the issue of criminal accountability do not clarify\nthe legal basis for the prosecution as they often provide quite general state-\nments on the legitimacy, accountability and good practices of UN missions.\nHowever, no clear legal backgrounds are provided. This may be associated\nwith the complex legal regulations of PKOs, and to the unclear position of\nStates in relation to the obligations of their personnel involved in PKOs.\nFurthermore, there is a problem with UN accountability, linked to its inter-\nnational legal personality.71 Acts of UN personnel may be attributable to the\norganization, with resulting international responsibility for the wrongdoing.\nHowever, this is not necessarily the case, as international responsibility is based\non international wrongful acts, committed by the personnel and imputable to\nthe organization, and on the \u2018effective control\u2019 test,72 as required by inter-\nnational case law.73 This is an issue related to the type of relationship that\nStates and the UN establish with regard to the personnel engaged in the\nPKO. It depends whether the national contingents and experts are under the\n\u2018exclusive\u2019 control of the UN or whether the State of origin still exercises some\nform of control over its nationals working for the UN, which is a matter not\ncompletely clarified in practice.\nMany of the crimes considered are often associated with forms of sexual abuse\nand criminal misbehaviour, and not with the conduct of hostilities or the accom-\nplishment of the mission\u2019s mandate. Crimes such as sexual abuse, rape, prostitu-\ntion, murder and bribery,74 are usually defined in national criminal codes and\nsome of them in international law treaties. The legal basis for punishing those\ncrimes may be based on a complex interrelationship between national and inter-\nnational law.\nThe legal regulation of PKOs is based on international law, and in particular\non the UN Charter. The mandates of PKOs are usually framed under inter-\n70 See McCoubrey and White (n 1); E Schmidl, Peace Operations Between War and\nPeace (Frank Cass, London 2000); T Findlay, The Use of Force in Peace Operations\n(OUP, Oxford 2002).\n71 ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of International Organizations, \u2018Report of\nthe International Law Commission Fifty-Sixth Session\u2019 (2004) UN Doc A\/59\/10; C\nLeck, \u2018International Responsibility in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: Com-\nmand and Control Arrangements and the Attribution of Conduct\u2019 (2009) 10 Mel-\nbourne J Intl L 346; M Zwanenburg, Accountability of Peace Support Operations\n(Martinus Nijhoff, Leiden 2005).\n72 ILC Draft Articles (n 71) art 5.\n73 Behrami v France and Saramati v France, Germany and Norway (2007) 45 EHHR\nSE10; R (on the Application of Al-Jedda) v Secretary of State for Defence [2008] 1\nAC 332.

International law, in the form of\nIHL and IHRL, would also play a role, even with some difficulties, due to the\nunclear position of the troops and other personnel in the field under UN PKO\nMandate. The various legal regimes that may apply to peacekeepers would also\ninclude the respect for the national law of the sending State and of the host State\nwhere they are deployed.75\nSome of the crimes under discussion, if committed in the context of an armed\nconflict, would entail the application of IHL.76 However, the majority of alleged\ncases committed by peacekeepers, both military and civilian personnel, can be\ndefined as ordinary crimes. Therefore, a distinction has to be made regarding the\npersonnel involved. In the case of military personnel, violations would concern\nmilitary disciplinary measures, including national military criminal codes. In the\ncase of civilian personnel, UN codes of conduct and national criminal law would\nbe applicable. Furthermore, UN personnel regulations include a series of obliga-\ntions for different categories of individuals working for the organization.77\nAmong them, the SG bulletins regulate the conduct of personnel for administra-\ntive and disciplinary purposes.78 Finally, SOFAs and MoUs signed by the UN\nand the States concerned, including TCCs and host States, may identify the rules\nthat apply to UN personnel.\nRegarding military personnel, their behaviour and possible punishment fall\nunder the exclusive authority of the sending State or TCC, under the standard\nrule included in MoUs signed by the UN and each TCC.79 It is reasonable to\nthink that the crimes under consideration would fit within the general discip-\nlinary powers of control that the State has on its contingents,80 due also to the\nSOFA81 between the UN and the host State, which provides exclusive juris-\ndiction to the TCC.82 This principle has not been challenged by any of the\nUN documents relating to the accountability of peacekeepers.83 The revised\n2007 MoU does not provide a clear list of crimes that should be prosecuted.\n75 \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) para 78.\n76 See D Shraga, \u2018UN Peacekeeping Operations: Applicability of International Humani-\ntarian Law and Responsibility for Operations-Related Damage\u2019 (2000) 94 AJIL 406.\n77 UN, \u2018Public Information Guidelines for Allegations of Misconduct Committed by\nPersonnel of UN Peacekeeping and Other Field Missions\u2019 DPKO\/MD\/03\/00996,\nDPKO\/CPD\/DPIG\/2003\/001.\n78 The Secretary-General Bulletin entitled \u2018Status, Basic Rights and Duties of United\nNations Staff Members\u2019, issued on 1 November 2002 (ST\/SGB\/2002\/13), provides a\ncommentary on these rules and also contains the International Civil Service Com-\nmission standards of conduct.\n79 1991 MoU (n 51) s 47(b).\n80 McCoubrey and White (n 1) 178.\n81 See s 4.B below.\n82 UNSG, \u2018Model Status of Forces Agreement for Peacekeeping Operations\u2019 (9 October\n1990) UN Doc A\/45\/594 annex para 41; \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) para 78.\n83 See UN Doc A\/60\/19 (22 March 2006) para 65.\n12 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nIt refers to the obligation of governments, through commanders of national\ncontingents, to deal with \u2018serious matters involving the discipline and good\norder of members of its national contingent including any disciplinary action\ntaken for violations of the United Nations standards of conduct or mission-\nspecific rules and regulations or failure to respect the local laws and regula-\ntions\u2019.84 In the new Annex H to the revised 2007 MoU, as part of the UN\nstandards of conduct, three UN documents are mentioned: \u2018Ten Rules \u2013 Code\nof Personal Conduct for Blue Helmets\u2019,85 \u2018We are United Nations Peace-\nkeepers\u201986 and a list of behaviours addressing \u2018Prohibitions on Sexual Exploit-\nation and Abuse\u2019.87\nMore general obligations also derive from Article 101 of the UN Charter\nwhich requires from its personnel the \u2018highest standards of integrity\u2019. Standards\ndefined in the 1999 and 2003 Secretary-General bulletins may also be applied to\nnon-military personnel, because reference to these documents has been included\nin contracts and other labour documents involving the UN and its personnel.\nHowever, in the revised 2007 MoU there is not yet a clear definition of account-\nability for the contingent commanders, while the lack of adequate sanctions on\nthe TCC or on individual members of the mission still leave the legal enforce-\nment quite weak.88 Some of the issues raised by the revised 2007 MoU will be\ndiscussed in the relevant following parts of this article.\nA. Privileges and Immunities in PKOs\nOne of the issues that may affect the proper investigation and prosecution of\nthe crimes under consideration is the international system of diplomatic im-\nmunities. IOs and their officials enjoy immunities as institutions that operate\nin the international system as legal subjects. The preamble of the 1961 Conven-\ntion on Diplomatic Relations89 asserts that \u2018the purpose of such privileges and\nimmunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance\nof the functions of diplomatic missions as representing States\u2019.

Status of Forces Agreements\nBecause the 1994 Convention does not directly refer to PKOs, the UN and TCC\nhave adopted SOFAs, which define the rights and obligations ofmilitary personnel\nengaged in each mission, including immunities and privileges.100 The SOFA\ncurrently used by the UN is based on a 1990 model,101 based on State practice\nin this field. In the case of criminal conduct of a member of the armed forces,\nparagraphs 5 and 8 of the SOFA establish that the judicial action remains in\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the TCC.102\nRegarding jurisdiction, paragraph 46 (SOFA) determines that all UN PKO\nstaff, including locally recruited personnel, are immune from legal process in\nrespect of words spoken or written and of acts performed by them in their\nofficial capacity. In the case of criminal offences, two different rules apply.\n98 Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, GA Res 49\/59\n(1994) UN Doc A\/49\/49.\n99 Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated\nPersonnel (6 January 2006) UN Doc A\/RES\/60\/42.\n100 See also 1999 SG Bulletin (n 113 below) art 3; eg, \u2018Status of Forces Agreement\nbetween the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and the\nGovernment of the United States of America\u2019 (signed 1 October 2002) art 2.\n101 UN Doc A\/45\/594 (n 82).\n102 \u2018Letter to the Acting Chair of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations,\nUnited Nations, regarding Immunities of Civilian Police and Military Personnel\u2019\nUN Juridical Ybk 2004 (2007) 323.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 15\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nUnder paragraph 47(a) if \u2018the accused person is a member of the civilian com-\nponent or a civilian member of the military component, the Special Represen-\ntative\/Commander shall conduct any necessary supplementary inquiry and then\nagree with the Government whether or not criminal proceedings should be in-\nstituted\u2019.

The\nimmunity of UN personnel raises problems in relation to the prosecution of\nthose crimes, because States do not easily accept that their personnel abroad\nshould be subject to local or international prosecution, as is clearly evidenced\nby the position of certain governments with regard to international criminal\njurisdictions.103 In particular, this issue has been the basis of quite complex dip-\nlomatic and legal negotiations regarding the exemption from prosecution from\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdiction, with specific reference to the\nUN mission in Bosnia\u2013Herzegovina (UNMIBH), under pressure from the\nUnited States.104\nC. The Nature of the Crimes and the Basis for Prosecution\nIt may be useful to consider the nature of crimes to identify the possible legal\nobligations under which individuals should be prosecuted, as they may also iden-\ntify the competent jurisdiction to deal with those cases. Three types of violation\ncommitted by personnel working in UN PKOs may be identified. The first\ncategory includes violations of IHL during the conduct of hostilities, generally\ncommitted by armed forces engaged in the mission.105 The second category refers\nto human rights violations committed by personnel working for the missions, in-\ncluding military, police and civilian components, which relate to possible abuses\nattached to the accomplishment of the mandate, for instance when using their\npowers of searching and arresting. A third category, which is the main focus of\nthis article, includes abuses and misconducts that are fundamentally criminal in\nnature, and are unrelated to the mandate of the mission. They include sexual\nabuse, rape, theft and other crimes.\nThe question here is whether they are human rights abuses, criminal con-\nducts, misbehaviour or disciplinary matters. As generally recognized by IHRL,\nofficial positions may lead to human rights violations, engaging State responsi-\nbility, even if the action was committed by the officer ultra vires.106 Some acts\n103 See D Fleck, \u2018Are Foreign Military Personnel Exempt from International Criminal\nJurisdiction under Status of Forces Agreements?\u2019 (2003) 1 J Intl Crim Justice 651\u201370.\n104 UNSC Res 1422 (12 July 2002) and Res 1847 (12 June 2003).\n105 McCoubrey and White (n 1) ch 8.\n106 Velasquez Rodriguez Case (1989) (Judgment of 29 July 1998), Inter-American Court\nof Human Rights (Ser C) no 4 (1988), paras 169\u201370; Timurtas v Turkey (App no\n23531\/94) ECHR (Judgment of 13 June 2000); Ertak v Turkey, ECHR (App no\n20764\/ 92) (Judgment of 9 May) 2000.\n16 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \ncan be classified as human rights violations, because the perpetrators impinge\non the rights of individuals that are defined and protected under IHRL, such as\nthe rights of the child, health and body integrity of the victim of abuse, and are\ncommitted either by State officials seconded to the UN, or by UN officers and\nagents abusing their official position.\nUnder IHRL, State officials are responsible for abuses, linked to the inter-\nnational obligations of their respective State. In the case of UN officers, the\nUN is not party to international law treaties on human rights, and from the legal\nperspective, the UN is not bound by treaty law. Furthermore, it has no perman-\nent police and judicial bodies that might investigate and prosecute its own\npersonnel. However, this impasse can be overcome in two ways. Due to the gen-\neral obligation of the UN to promote and protect human rights under its consti-\ntutive Charter,107 customary law obligations would bind the UN which would be\n\u2018constitutionally mandated to promote the advancement of human rights\u2019.108 It\nwould be then relevant to determine whether certain criminal acts under consid-\neration are now offences under international customary law. The other option is\nto attribute to the State of nationality of the individual the task of prosecuting\nthe person for violation of IHRL as part of the State obligation under IHRL and\nas a UN Member State.\nThe criminal acts trigger the responsibility of their respective State109 and\/or\ninstitution with regard to the obligation of respecting human rights. This would\nbring into action the possible extraterritorial applicability of human rights law\nwhen national personnel are acting abroad.110 This is still a complex issue that\nis not always appreciated by States that contribute PKO personnel.\nHowever, the various types of violation are not easily identified because\nthe law regulating PKOs is also unclear and it is sometimes difficult to define\nunder which legal framework the criminal act may be framed.111 The possible\n107 UN Charter arts 1(3), 55(c) and 56.\n108 T Dannenbaum, \u2018Translating the Standard of Effective Control into a System of\nEffective Accountability\u2019 (2010) 51 Harvard Intl LJ 324.\n109 A Nollkaemper, \u2018Concurrence between Individual Responsibility and State Re-\nsponsibility in International Law\u2019 (2003) 52 ICLQ 615\u201340.\n110 HKing, \u2018TheExtraterritorialHumanRightsObligations of States\u2019 (2009) 9HumanRights\nLRev 521; TMeron, \u2018Extraterritoriality ofHumanRights\u2019 (1995) 89AJIL 78;MScheinin,\n\u2018Extraterritorial Effect of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\u2019 in F\nCoomans andMTKamminga (eds),ExtraterritorialApplication ofHumanRights Treaties\n(Intersentia, Mortsel 2004) 73; HRCGeneral Comment 31, \u2018Nature of the General Legal\nObligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant\u2019 (26May 2004) CCPR\/C\/21\/Rev 1\/\nAdd 13; (2004) 11 IHRR 905 para 10;Legal Consequences of the Construction of aWall in\nthe Occupied Palestinian Territory (Advisory Opinion) [2004] ICJ Rep 136 para 111;Case\nConcerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo v Uganda) (Judgment) [2005] ICJ Rep 1 paras 178\u201380.\n111 J Saura, \u2018Lawful Peacekeeping: Applicability of International Humanitarian Law to\nUnited Nations Peacekeeping Operations\u2019 (2006\u201307) 58 Hastings LJ 479.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 17\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nconcurrent application of IHL, human rights law and national criminal law is\nthe source of this unclear state of affairs.\nIf a member of the armed forces engaged in PKO has committed a viola-\ntion of IHL in principle, as established by the general rules of IHL,112 and\nreaffirmed in the 1999 UN SG Bulletin,113 he or she would face prosecution\nin the courts of the TCC,114 confirmed by the new Model MoU between the\nUN and the TCC.115\nIn the case of human rights violations, the grounds for prosecution are based\non international obligations of States that provide UN personnel, who may re-\ntain their jurisdiction over nationals abroad for violation of IHRL and, in some\ncases, for the prosecution of criminal acts foreseen under their national criminal\nlaw. This seems more an issue of competence related to the exercise of jurisdic-\ntion, rather than a matter concerning the definition of the applicable law and its\nqualification as IHRL or criminal law. The documents and reports adopted by\nthe UN on this matter do not clarify those issues. They focus on the disciplinary\naspects of the misconduct of UN personnel, rather than on the clarification of\nresponsibility and accountability of States and IOs for the wrongdoings, and for\ndamages to the victims. Under existing rules, the UN peacekeeping force, es-\ntablished under SC or GA mandate, is a subsidiary organ of the organization.\nFor the UN this means that \u2018an act of a peacekeeping force is, in principle, at-\ntributable to the Organization\u2019.116 The relationship between the UN and TCC is\ndefined in Article 9 of the Model MoU,117 which outlines the concurrent re-\nsponsibility of the UN and the State. The UN shall be responsible for damages\nor loss of property, death or personal injury caused by the personnel or equip-\nment provided by the government \u2018in the performance of services or any other\nactivity or operation\u2019 under the MoU. However, \u2018if the loss, damage, death or\ninjury arose from gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the personnel pro-\nvided by the Government, the Government shall be liable for such claim\u2019.118\nThis clear-cut distinction is not always possible, because it depends on which\nentity: State, UN or other organization (ie NATO) exercises effective control\nover the personnel and over the operation.\nIn the following sections of this article, several options will be considered, on\nthe basis of UN recommended measures.\n112 In the 1949 Geneva Conventions I art 49; II art 50; III art 129; IV art 146.

Jurisdictional Gaps or Legal Vacuum?\nSeveral UN reports have identified a \u2018jurisdictional gap\u2019119 when a crime is\ncommitted in a host State that is unable to prosecute the alleged offender,\ndue to its specific circumstances. As PKOs act within a situation of armed con-\nflict or high instability, it is not always possible to provide a proper judicial and\ninvestigation system to deal with criminal acts by peacekeepers. If other States,\nincluding the TCC, have not extended their criminal jurisdiction to crimes com-\nmitted in the host State, there could be a jurisdictional gap that may leave the\nalleged criminal unpunished.120 However, the lack of willingness by UN Mem-\nber States to effectively prosecute their personnel involved in alleged criminal\nacts should not be underestimated. To address, in part, this problem, and some\nof the legal issues that may create obstacles to proper judicial action, the UN\nprovided a set of options that are analysed below.\nA. Jurisdiction Ratione Personae and Peacekeeping Personnel\nAs mentioned before, different types of PKO personnel are regulated by differ-\nent rules. The Zeid Report identified at least five categories of personnel: UN\nstaff; UN Volunteers (UNVs); individual contractors and consultants; civilian po-\nlice and military observers; and military members of national armed forces.121\nThis subdivision does not facilitate the task of prosecution in cases of alleged\ncriminal offences by peacekeepers.\nUN personnel are governed by UN Staff Rules and other administrative UN\nregulations,122 including the SG bulletins, and also enjoy privileges and immun-\nities under the 1994 UN Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the UN.\nThe UNVs working for UN PKOs are regulated by their own rules of conduct,123\nand have been covered by the privileges and immunities that are defined in the\n1991 Model MoU.124 Individual contractors and consultants are regulated by\nUN standard conditions of contract specified in specific administrative instruc-\ntions.125 Under these instructions, they do not have the status of UN officers,\ntherefore they are subject to the local law of the host State, but they can be granted\nthe status of experts on mission when travelling on behalf of the UN.126 Civilian\n119 UNGA, Sixth Committee, 5th Meeting (AM) (10 October 2008) UN Doc GA\/L\/3342.\n120 UN Doc A\/62\/329 (n 66) para 17.\n121 \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) paras 15\u201322.\n122 UN \u2018Staff Regulations of the United Nations and Provisional Staff Rules\u2019 (21 October\n2009) UN Doc ST\/SGB\/2009\/7.\n123 \u2018Rules of Conduct for UN Volunteer (UNV) Specialists\u2019, in UNICEF \u2018United Nations\nVolunteer Specialists: Guidelines\u2019 (10 April 2000) CF\/AI\/2000-003 annex C.\n124 See (n 51) ss 24\u201331, 46\u20139.\n125 \u2018Consultants and Individual Contractors, Administrative Instruction\u2019, Consolidated\ntext of ST\/AI\/1999\/7, as last amended by ST\/AI\/1999\/7\/Amend.1 (effective 1 April\n2006).\n126 Ibid s 5.4.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 19\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \npolice and military observers are covered by the privileges and immunities as ex-\nperts on mission for the UN. As experts on mission they are also subject to the\n\u2018Regulations Governing the Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials Other\nThan Secretariat Officials and Experts on Mission\u2019.127 The rules for police and\nmilitary observers are defined in the DPKO\u2019s \u2018Directives for Disciplinary Matters\nInvolving Civilian Police Officers and Military Observers\u2019.128 Military personnel\nhave privileges and immunities, and are also governed by the SOFAs with the host\nState.\nThe main distinction is based on military members of national contingents and\nother types of personnel. The first are considered to fall under the \u2018exclusive\njurisdiction\u2019 of the TCC. The other cases are covered by the UN personnel status\nand immunities. This issue needs further clarification. The distinction is based on\nthe relationship of the personnel with the UN. Due to the absence of a perman-\nent UN military structure under UN direct command, military personnel \u2018are\nprovided by a sending State as representatives of that State\u2019.129 Their status is\ncovered by a MoU between the sending State and the UN, which gives the TCC\nexclusive jurisdiction over its troops on the basis of a practice established since\nUNEF, and included in paragraph 47(b) of the Model SOFA. This issue has been\nparticularly significant for all TCCs because they would not allow their troops to\nfall under foreign jurisdiction.130\nMilitary observers are also military officers who are \u2018assigned\u2019 to the UN.131\n\u2018They are nominated by their Governments following a request by the Secretary-\nGeneral and serve the United Nations in a personal capacity and not as repre-\nsentatives of their State\u2019.132 They are classified as \u2018experts on mission\u2019 as defined\nin Article VI of the 1946 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the\nUnited Nations, by paragraph 47(a) of the Model SOFA,133 and by a MoU be-\ntween the UN and the sending State.134\n127 UNGA Res 56\/280 (27 March 2002).\n128 DPKO\/CPD\/DDCPO\/2003\/001, DPKO\/MD\/03\/00994 (2003).\n129 UN Doc A\/62\/329 (n 66) para 56.\n130 J Washburn, \u2018Assessments of the United States Position: the International Criminal\nCourt Arrives \u2013 The U.S. Position: Status and Prospects\u2019 (2002) 25 Fordham Intl LJ\n873.\n131 Military observers are subject to different financial and accountability regimes\ncompared with national contingents, they are not entitled to carry weapons, they\nare specifically prohibited from seeking and accepting instructions from their gov-\nernment or any other authority except the UN, see \u2018UN Regulations Governing\nthe Status, Basic Rights and Duties of Officials other than Secretariat Officials,\nand Experts on Mission\u2019 (ST\/SGB\/2002\/9).\n132 UN Doc A\/62\/329 (n 66) para 55.\n133 This provides that the UN Representative\/Commander shall conduct any necessary\nsupplementary inquiry, besides the host State, and then agree with the government\nwhether or not criminal proceedings will be instituted.

The Draft Convention contains two possible definitions. One includes\n\u2018Members of the United Nations PKO to whom article V or article VI of the\n1946 General Convention applies, in whole or in part, pursuant to either the pro-\nvisions of the status-of-forces-agreement entered into by the United Nations and\nthe host State for the PKO or, pending the conclusion of such an agreement, the\nprovisional application of the model status-of-forces-agreement (A\/45\/594) da-\nted 9 October 1990\u2019.135 The second option includes official and experts \u2018who\nare present in an official capacity in the area where a United Nations PKO is\nbeing conducted and who enjoy privileges and immunities of the United Nations\npursuant to either articles V and VI of the General Convention, if applicable, or\nArticle [sic!] 105 of the Charter of the United Nations\u2019.136 This definition seems\nwider than the previous one, and it adopts the definition given by article 1(a)(i)\nof the 1994 General Convention.137 It has been suggested that \u2018even though the\n1994 General Convention does not define experts on mission, these individuals\nare UN agents but not UN officials\u2019.138 However, this new classification does not\nclarify the legal status of those \u2018agents\u2019, with the risk of adding even more un-\ncertainty to an already complex matter, unless it is used to define the issues of\nindividual, State and UN responsibility under international law.\nA third category concerns the status of \u2018formed police units\u2019 in PKOs.139 The\nGLE noted that there are ongoing discussions on the legal status of those units,\nbut that the members of such units are currently classified as experts on mission\nand therefore they also enjoy functional immunities.140\nThere is a problem concerning the identification of the rules applicable to\nother UN agencies, because their privileges and immunities are not regulated\nunder the UN Charter and the 1994 General Convention, but by specific legal\ndocuments,141 and their immunities may be waived by the heads of their re-\nspective organizations.142 To further complicate the matter, not all States are\nparties to the 1994 General Convention. In those cases, it has been suggested\nthat the personnel legal status would derive from article 105 of the UN Charter,\nand that the privileges and immunities defined in the 1994 General Convention,\nbeing widely accepted, may constitute the minimum standards for the imple-\n135 2006 Draft Convention (n 44) art 1(d)(i).\n136 Ibid art 1(d)(ii).\n137 See above (n 98).\n138 AJ Miller, \u2018Legal Aspects of Stopping Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in U.N.\nPeacekeeping Operations\u2019 (2006) 39 Cornell Intl LJ 71.\n139 See UN \u2018Functions and Organization of Formed Police Units in United Nations\nPeacekeeping Operations\u2019 (9 November 2006) DPKO\/PD\/2006\/00060.\n140 UN Doc A\/61\/645 (18 December 2006) para 5.\n141 Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies, New York\n(21 November 1947) 33 UNTS 261.\n142 PHF Bekker, The Legal Position of Intergovernmental Organizations: A Functional\nNecessity Analysis of Their Legal Status and Immunities (Brill, Dordrecht 1994).\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 21\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nmentation of Article 105, and be regarded as general customary law.143 The\nGLE suggested including also personnel who are not members of the PKO,\nbut who act for other UN agencies and programmes, in the Draft Convention\nbecause the local population would not easily distinguish between the different\ntypes of personnel. In a subsequent Note, the Secretary-General supported that\noption, considering that \u2018there is no major policy impediment as to why a con-\nvention could not apply to cover all persons participating in the United Nations\noperations, irrespective of the department, office, programme or fund with\nwhom they are engaged\u2019.144 However, any change regarding the legal status\nof military observers and police units should also be reflected in their relation-\nship with the UN, and in relation to the host State as defined in the SOFA and\nin the Status of Mission Agreements (SOMAs), to provide a uniform and clear\ndefinition of the applicable law.\nB. Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae\nAs already mentioned before, the discussion on criminal accountability of\npeacekeepers had started with cases related to sexual abuse. The Zeid Report\nreferred to \u2018serious misconduct\u2019 based on the 2003 SG Bulletin and the Staff\nRegulations and Rules, which justify summary dismissal from service of a staff\nmember found culpable by the Secretary-General.145 The subsequent debate\non issues of criminal accountability has identified other crimes. Article 3 of\nthe Draft Convention states that a UN official or an expert on mission commits\na crime \u2018if that person intentionally engages in conduct which constitutes one\nof the serious crimes set out in paragraph 2 of the present article\u2019. The \u2018serious\ncrimes\u2019 listed are \u2018for each State party establishing and exercising jurisdiction\u2026\nthose which, under the national law of that State party, correspond to:\n(a) Murder;\n(b) Wilfully causing serious injury to body or health;\n(c) Rape and acts of sexual violence;\n(d) Sexual offences involving children;\n(e) An attempt to commit any crime set out in subparagraphs (a) to (d); and\n(f) Participation in any capacity, such as an accomplice, assistant or instigator\nin any crime set out in subparagraphs (a) to (e)\u2019.\nThe 2007 Note by the Secretary-General recognizes \u2018the difficulty in establish-\ning a finite list of crimes that should be covered by a convention\u2019. There is con-\ncern about other crimes such as torture and degrading treatment, but also theft,\n143 See statement made by the UN Legal Counsel at the 1016th meeting of the Sixth\nCommittee of the GA on 6 December 1967 ST\/LEG\/SER, C\/5 (1967) UN Juridical\nYbk 311\u201314 paras 9\u201311.\n144 UN Doc A\/62\/329 (n 66) para 34.\n145 2003 SG Bulletin (n 34) s 3.2(a).\n22 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nfraud and money-laundering,146 identified by the Secretariat following the al-\nlegations of gold and arms trafficking against MONUC.147 Furthermore, the\nAd Hoc Committee148 clarified that the broader range of crimes should be\ndivided into two notionally different sets: \u2018crimes committed against the gen-\neral populace and those committed against the Organization itself\u2019.149 It is not\nclear whether this distinction would have different legal consequences for the\ncriminal accountability of individuals, or could lead to different procedures of\ninvestigation.\nCompared with national criminal law, the above-mentioned list is too vague\nto match the strict standards required under criminal law,150 even if inter-\nnational tribunals have adopted less stringent standards sometimes.151 The\nUN Secretariat pointed out that the Draft Convention should not try to define\ncrimes that are already recognized by all Member States, and there would not\nbe new crimes under international law that might require agreed definitions.\nHowever, it should be noted that there are differences in criminal law among\nnational jurisdictions regarding, for instance, the age limits for sexual consent\nand punishment, prostitution, certain sexual behaviour, such as homosexuality,\nand rules of criminal procedure.\nTo avoid further obstacles to the exercise of proper legal action, the GLE\nsuggested that, rather than trying to harmonize criminal law of UN Member\nStates, efforts should focus on \u2018identifying a matrix of crimes common to most\njurisdictions\u2019 to avoid impunity. The Secretariat suggested that crimes should\nbe defined \u2018under the national law of the State asserting jurisdiction and that\nare punishable under that nation\u2019s law by at least two\/three years\u2019 imprison-\nment\u2019.152 To support this position, the UN Secretariat mentioned the example\nof the UN Model Treaty on Extradition,153 which defines extraditable of-\nfences as those \u2018which are punishable under the laws of both Parties by im-\nprisonment or other deprivation of liberty for a maximum of period of at\nleast one\/two year(s), or by a more severe penalty\u2019.154 In case of uncertainty\nabout the crimes that have been given extraterritorial effect under the Draft\nConvention, Member States might notify the Secretary-General of such\ncrimes.155\n146 2007 Report of the Ad Hoc Committee, UN Doc A\/62\/54 (n 57) para 22.\n147 UN Doc A\/62\/329 (n 66) para 37.\n148 See above (n 46).\n149 UN Doc A\/62\/54 (n 57) para 22.\n150 See ICTY, Prosecutor v Vasilievi\u0107 IT-98-32 (29 November 2002) para 193.\n151 W Schabas, The UN International Criminal Tribunals: the Former Yugoslavia, Rwanda\nand Sierra Leone (CUP, Cambridge 2006) 63\u20137.\n152 UN Doc A\/62\/329 (n 66) para 39.\n153 UN Doc A\/RES\/45\/116 (14 December 1990).\n154 UNGA Res 45\/116 annex art 2.\n155 UN Doc A\/62\/239, para 41.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 23\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n6. The Exercise of Jurisdiction\nIssues concerning the effective exercise of jurisdiction are particularly relevant\nconsidering the immunity from local jurisdiction.156 It is clear that criminal acts\nare not part of the \u2018official functions\u2019 of UN personnel. Nevertheless, this does\nnot necessarily mean that UN officers shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the\nhost State, where the crime was committed. It has been rightly observed that\nwhen States have a \u2018dysfunctional legal system\u2019 it may not be in the interest of\nthe UN to agree, under the SOFAs, \u2018to the host State instituting criminal jur-\nisdiction or to waive immunities or certify the absence of immunity where the\nhost State requests the United Nations to do so\u2019.157\nDespite the fact that this practice seems to conceal forms of impunity, in real-\nity when the local legal system does not provide sufficient guarantees, a criminal\naction that does not fulfil internationally recognized standards of criminal and\nprocedural law might lead to a violation of human rights of UN officers, in par-\nticular the right to a fair trial.158\nAnother relevant aspect regarding the exercise of jurisdiction by a State is\nthe so-called \u2018dual criminality\u2019 principle.159 This implies that some States may\nextend their jurisdiction to acts committed abroad, but only when the conduct\nalso constitutes a crime where it was committed, and vice versa. Several States\napply this rule as a prerequisite for extradition and legal assistance in criminal\nmatters.160 It has been suggested that this precept could be limited \u2018by encour-\naging States to review or to adopt a liberal interpretation of their requirements\nand to co-operate with each other to the maximum possible extent in the in-\nvestigation and prosecution of serious crimes committed by peacekeeping\npersonnel, in particular those involving sexual exploitation and abuse\u2019.161 How-\never, it is not quite clear, from the legal point of view, how States could \u2018limit\u2019\nor \u2018interpret\u2019 their criminal law standards, only in relation to PKOs.\n156 See above (n 90).\n157 UN Doc A\/60\/980 (n 40) para 19.\n158 See S Zappal\u00e0, Human Rights in International Criminal Proceedings (Oxford\nMonographs in International Law, OUP, Oxford 2003); D Harris, \u2018The Right to\na Fair Trial in Criminal Proceedings as a Human Right\u2019 (1967) 16 ICLQ 352;\n1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights, UNGA Res 217 A (III) art 10;\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights, CETS no 005 art 6; European Court\nof Human Rights, Delcourt v Belgium (17 January 1970) para 25; Roche v the\nUnited Kingdom (19 October 2005); K\u00f6nig v the Federal Republic of Germany\n(28 June 1978) para 89.\n159 See R Cryer, H Friman, D Robinson and E Wilmshurst, International Criminal Law\nand Procedure (CUP, Cambridge 2007) 74\u20136.\n160 See EU, Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest\nWarrant and the Surrender Procedures between Member States (18 July 2002) 190\nOJL 1\u201320.

A mere \u2018rule of inter-\npretation\u2019 would not meet the criminal law standards of certainty and might be a\nsource of discriminatory treatment. On the issue of dual criminality, Article 5 of\nthe Draft Convention affirms that the definition of States\u2019 jurisdiction concerning\nthe identified crimes does not \u2018impose an obligation on a State party to establish\njurisdiction over conduct which does not constitute a crime under the law of the\nState where the conduct occurred\u2019. However, it would be relevant to clarify\nwhich rules under IHRL should be incorporated in national criminal law to pun-\nish officials who may commit abuses not yet defined under national law but that\nmay violate rights defined under international law, such as the 1999 UN Conven-\ntion on the Rights of the Child, which may set higher age limits compared with\nnational law.\nA third issue regarding the exercise of jurisdiction is that some States would\nnot prosecute in the absence of the alleged offender (prosecution \u2018in absentia\u2019).\nIn those cases, the prosecution could start after the alleged offender is present\nin the territory of the State that may exercise jurisdiction. This could be facili-\ntated through extradition to secure custody of that person. However, it is well\nknown that there are problems regarding extradition, not only in relation to\npeacekeeping personnel, as mentioned earlier. These problems are particularly\nserious when the host State asking for extradition has a dysfunctional legal sys-\ntem. It has been suggested that in these cases, under the rule-of-law mandate\nof PKOs, the UN should provide assistance to the host State \u2018to rehabilitate its\nrelevant authorities that are involved in the extradition process, at least in re-\nlation to serious crimes\u2019.163 Even if this sounds a good suggestion, in reality it\nmay take a long time to provide proper training of the judiciary and reforms of\nthe local legal system. Therefore, the reasonable time required for the exercise\nof criminal prosecution,164 as part of the fair trial definition, might not be\nmatched. Some States base extradition and cooperation in criminal matters\non the principle of reciprocity, particularly in the absence of a treaty defining\nthe type of cooperation.165 For European States this may also involve compli-\nance with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, regarding\nthe fair trial conditions.166\nFinally, it may be relevant to consider the possible role of the ICC. This\noption seems more remote and not feasible at this stage, due to the present\nnature of international crimes defined in the 1998 Rome Statute.167 The jur-\nisdiction of the ICC would apply only to the most serious crimes, which are\n162 See ICESCR General Comment no 16, UN Doc E\/2006\/22 (2005) 116 para 9.\n163 Ibid para 25.

The very nature of inter-\nnational crimes, as defined and intended in present international law, is to\nprovide remedies for widespread abuses and violations of human rights and\nhumanitarian law, as part of policy and systematic political and military plans,\nrather than deal with individual criminal misconduct of isolated individuals.171\nWar crimes172 in the form of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, in\nparticular torture or inhuman treatment,173 and wilfully causing great suffering,\nor serious injury to body and health, would not need the widespread and sys-\ntematic requirement. However, it would probably be difficult to consider\npeacekeepers as parties involved in an international armed conflict,174 as States\nwould not regard the PKO as fully regulated under IHL for the reasons\nalready mentioned before.\nIt is also important to remember here that States have concerns regarding the\npossible exercise of jurisdiction by the ICC over their national troops. The case\nof the United States\u2019 strategy towards the ICC, including forms of immunity175\nfor its peacekeepers, is quite emblematic to clarify this point.176\nThe GLE has defined these crimes as not \u2018merely ordinary crimes\u2019,177 due to\nthe special responsibility to protect the population where they are deployed.178 If\nthis may be acceptable in principle, it is also difficult to define a new category of\ncrimes, based on this type of justification. All these issues are further discussed\nbelow in relation to specific aspects of States\u2019 jurisdiction.

UN Jurisdiction\nThe UN has clearly affirmed that there are limits to its exercise of jurisdic-\ntion. The 2007 Note by the Secretariat underlines the fact that the UN can\ndevelop and implement standards and special measures,179 including the 2003\nSG Bulletin,180 to improve the so-called \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy through dis-\nsemination, education, pre-deployment and in-mission training campaigns;\nthe establishment of Conduct and Discipline Units in Headquarters and in\nUN missions, regular patrolling and creation of out-of-bound areas to imple-\nment discipline and behaviour. However, it clearly stated that \u2018the Secretariat\ncannot hold a person criminally accountable\u2019.181 The UN can adopt disciplin-\nary sanctions for its personnel, based on administrative investigations,182 and\nrelated to individual behaviour that breaches the standards mentioned before.\nHowever, the UN cannot exercise forms of legal jurisdiction to punish crim-\ninal actions committed by its own personnel, due to the lack of structures,\npersonnel and funding.\nIn the 2003 SG Bulletin, violations of standards were defined as \u2018serious mis-\nconduct\u2019. The UN administrative investigation would be carried out only after\nthe applicable code of conduct was identified and the specific behaviour con-\nstituted an alleged breach of that code.183 The only exception to this general\nrule is when the UN mission has an executive mandate providing governmental\npowers, including law enforcement and prosecutorial powers in the host State,\nas in the case of the UN missions in Kosovo184 and Timor-Leste.185 Having\nadministrative control over the territory, the UN organs in the field may exer-\ncise judicial functions, which should also comply with international human\nrights standards. Under these circumstances the Secretary-General might have\nfewer concerns in waiving the immunities of UN personnel. In the Gashi\ncase,186 related to arbitrary detention in Kosovo, UNMIK decided to compen-\nsate the alleged victims after a decision by a panel of international judges in\nPristina.187 However, most PKOs would not have this mandate, because host\n179 See UN Docs A\/60\/19 (22 March 2006) para 65; and A\/61\/645 (n 140) para 40.\n180 ST\/SGB\/2003\/13 (n 34) above.\n181 UN Doc A\/62\/329 (n 66) para 16.\n182 See s 7.A below.\n183 UN Doc A\/62\/329 (n 66) para 15.\n184 UNSC Res 1244 (1999).\n185 UNSC Res 1704 (2006).\n186 United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), \u2018Core Com-\nmon Document Forming a Part of the Reports Submitted by United Nations In-\nterim Administration Mission in Kosovo to Human Rights Treaty Bodies\u2019 (13\nMarch 2006) UN Doc CCPR\/C\/UNK\/1 para 131.\n187 See Sweetser (n 9) 1665; Rawski (n 9) 122.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 27\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nStates would not easily accept those pervasive powers on their territory. In\nall other cases, the only possible option is the waiver of immunities by the\nSecretary-General followed by criminal proceedings by a competent criminal\ncourt. For this reason UN bodies have tried \u2018to identify a State that may be able\nto exercise jurisdiction over the alleged offender and to assess whether the conduct\nmay amount to criminal conduct under the laws of that State\u2019.188 These options are\nconsidered in the following three sections.\nB. The Host State Jurisdiction\nThe GLE affirmed that \u2018as far as possible, the host State should exercise juris-\ndiction\u2019189 on crimes committed in its own territory. This is an undisputed\nprinciple based on the principle of sovereignty, and can be exercised \u2018regardless\nof the identity of the alleged offender or of the victim, of whether another\nState can exercise jurisdiction over the same conduct\u2019.190 Furthermore, there\nis an obligation for UN peacekeeping personnel to respect all local law and\nregulations \u2018as a corollary to their enjoyment of privileges and immunities in\nthe host State\u2019.191 Article 7 of the Draft Convention adopts this principle,\nestablishing that:\n[t]he State party in the territory of which the alleged offender is present\nshall, if it does not extradite that person, be obliged, without exception\nwhatsoever and without undue delay, to submit the case to its competent\nauthorities for the purpose of prosecution. Those authorities shall take\ntheir decision in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of\na serious nature under the law of that State.192\nThere are several advantages in applying this rule because witnesses and evi-\ndence are generally located where the criminal act was committed and the inves-\ntigation can be better carried out, compared with trials conducted abroad, which\nmay imply transfer of witnesses and evidence, leading necessarily to delays and\nextra costs. Another advantage is the impact on the local population which would\nperceive a \u2018greater sense of justice being done and being seen to be done\u2019,193\nan issue that has been pointed out also in relation to the establishment of inter-\nnational criminal tribunals.\n188 UN Doc A\/60\/980 (n 40) para 16.\n189 Ibid para 27.\n190 Ibid para 27(a).\n191 Ibid para 27(c).\n192 This text is derived from art 14 of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and\nAssociated Personnel (n 98) and from article 8(1) of the International Convention on\nthe Suppression of Terrorist Bombings (UNGA Res 52\/164 annex).\n193 UN Doc A\/60\/980 (n 40) para 27(d).\n28 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nWhen the host State has a dysfunctional legal system, the GLE suggests that\nthe UN should ensure the interests of the alleged offender, for instance through\nad hoc agreements between the host State and the UN before the waiver of im-\nmunity. Also, the host State should agree to accept UN assistance to ensure the\nrespect of human rights standards in dealing with the case.194 This procedure\nmight create a double standard, one for the local population and one for inter-\nnational personnel. The GLE considered that despite reasonable concern re-\ngarding this risk, it is already accepted that military contingents are subject to\nthe exclusive foreign jurisdiction, and the consideration is that in those cases,\n\u2018some accountability may often be better than none for the victims\u2019.195 This rea-\nsoning has clearly some appeal, but it is based on practical reasons rather than\non legal standards, as it is clearly a form of discrimination to impose the appli-\ncation of human rights standards for one group of people, and admit that others,\nin the same circumstances, would be treated differently within the same jurisdic-\ntion and by the same judicial authorities.\nC. Hybrid Tribunals\nA possible option that could overcome problems related to the exercise of jur-\nisdiction by the host State might be the establishment of hybrid tribunals.196\nExamples include the Special Court for Sierra Leone, the Extraordinary Cham-\nbers in Cambodia and the Special Panels for serious crimes established by the\nUnited Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET).197 The\nexperience of hybrid tribunals is linked to post-conflict situations addressing\nthe prosecution of the most serious international crimes. This would not usually\nbe the case for the crimes under consideration. The GLE suggests that \u2018hybrid\ntribunals can be established to deal exclusively with domestic crimes, including\nthose committed by peacekeepers, which do not rise to the level of international\ncrimes\u2019.198 The identified advantages include the involvement of the international\ncommunity, which would entail international standards of procedures according\nto international human rights principles. It would also avoid double standards\nbetween peacekeepers and the local population.

Jurisdiction of Other States\nDue to some difficulties that can arise from the exercise of criminal jurisdiction\nby the host State, other States might exert jurisdiction to prosecute crimes com-\nmitted by peacekeepers. Under international law, the exercise of criminal juris-\ndiction is based on five possible grounds200 when crimes are committed outside\nthe territory of a State:\n(i) nationality or active personality, when a State can assert its jurisdiction\nfor acts committed abroad by its citizens;\n(ii) effects or objective territoriality, when acts committed abroad have or\nmay have effects on the territory of that State;\n(iii) passive personality, in cases when the victim of the crime is a national of\nthat State;\n(iv) protective principle, when jurisdiction is considered to protect essential\ninterests of the State affected by that conduct abroad;\n(v) universal jurisdiction, in case of crimes defined under international law\nand without regard to the nationality and territorial nexus of the offender\nwith the State exercising jurisdiction.\nThe GLE considered that only a few of those principles would be relevant in the\ncase of peacekeeping personnel. In particular it discussed the nationality and\nuniversal grounds for jurisdiction. The GLE suggested that all States \u2018should\nestablish jurisdiction over serious crimes against the person, in particular\nthose involving sexual exploitation and abuse, committed by their nationals in\npeacekeeping operations\u2019.201\n(i) TCC jurisdiction\nThe nationality principle would ensure that when the host State is not able to\nexercise its jurisdiction, the sending State would conduct the investigation and\nsubsequent prosecution. Furthermore, the exercise by the State of jurisdiction\nover its own citizens does not require any international agreement, as this is a\nconsequence of the exercise of sovereign powers of the State over its nationals.\nIn 2008 and 2009, the UN Secretariat published a list of replies from Member\nStates regarding their existing laws criminalizing the mentioned crimes.202 Dif-\nferent rules apply that show some problems in the application of national crim-\ninal legislation to nationals abroad. For instance, the Argentinean Penal Code\ncan be applied to offences committed in the national territory,203 and would\nnot apply to international civil servants, as they are not considered to be gov-\n200 ED Dickinson, \u2018Introductory Comment to the Harvard Draft Convention on Jurisdic-\ntion with Respect to Crime 1935\u2019 (1935) 29 AJIL Supp 443.\n201 UN Doc A\/60\/980 (n 40) para 47.\n202 UN Doc A\/63\/260 (11 August 2008); A\/64\/183 (28 July 2009).\n203 Argentine Penal Code, Law no 11729 (1984) art 1(1).\n30 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nernment agents or employees.204 Similarly, in the case of Canada, based on the\ncommon law tradition, the application of Canadian criminal law is limited to the\nnational territory, the only exception being the possible prosecution of inter-\nnational crimes.205 In the case of Ireland, serious offences committed by Irish\nUN personnel in another State would not be prosecuted in Ireland.206 Some\nStates already allow the prosecution of nationals serving in UN missions. In the\ncase of Germany,207 Brazil,208 Sweden209 and Switzerland,210 nationals can be\nprosecuted also when serving for the UN. A quite developed system is foreseen\nby New Zealand. The 1971 Armed Forces Discipline Act211 allows for jurisdiction\non Defence Forces anywhere,212 also when acting as members of UN missions.213\nThe United Nations (Police) Act 1964 establishes the same jurisdiction in the case\nof UN police units.214 The more recent Crime and Misconduct (Overseas Opera-\ntions) Act 2004 would apply to any other citizen who does not fit into the two\nprevious cases, serving in an \u2018overseas operations force\u2019.215 The US Uniform\nCode of Military Justice216 provides a very detailed set of crimes, including child\nabuse,217 sexual harassment,218 rape,219 cruelty and maltreatment.220 It also al-\nlows for prosecution of military personnel while on duty and when still enlisted\nin US military service.221 Other States, such as Australia, have amended their na-\ntional criminal law,222 to incorporate the possible prosecution of their nationals\nserving abroad under international mandate. Furthermore, some States have\nspecific provisions that extend their criminal jurisdiction when nationals and\npermanent residents are involved in sexual tourism abroad.223 These provisions\n204 Ibid art 1(2).\n205 Canada, Criminal Code (RS, 1985, c C-46), s 7.\n206 UN Doc A\/63\/260 (n 202) para 21.\n207 Germany, Criminal Code (13 November 1998) (Federal Law Gazette I 945, 3322), ss 5,\n6(2)\u2013(8).\n208 Brazil, Penal Code, Decreto Lei no 2848 (7 December 1940) art 7(2)(b).\n209 Sweden, Penal Code (1962), c 2, 3 ss 2\u20135.\n210 Switzerland, Criminal Code (21 December 1937) arts 3\u20137 and Military Criminal Code\n(13 June 1927) arts 3, 8, 10.\n211 New Zealand, Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971 no 53 (Royal Assent 12 November\n1971).\n212 Ibid s 78.\n213 Ibid s 8.\n214 New Zealand, United Nations (Police) Act 1964, no 1 (Royal Assent 21 June 1964)\ns 3.\n215 Crimes and Misconduct (Overseas Operations) Act 2004 no 17 (Date of Assent 5\nApril 2004) (as at 1 October 2008) s 3.\n216 USA, UCMJ 64 Stat 109, 10 USC c 47 (2009).\n217 Ibid para 843.\n218 Ibid para 1561.\n219 Ibid para 920.\n220 Ibid para 893.\n221 Ibid para 802, art 2.\n222 Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964 No 116 of 1964 as amended by Act no 73 of 2008, s 3(A).\n223 New Zealand, Crimes Act 1961 No 43 (as at 1 June 2010), s 98AA, s 134, s 144A; UK,\nSexual Offences Act 2003 (c 42).\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 31\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nare meant to address that specific issue, but they could be used in the case of\nsexual abuses by peacekeepers, as criminal prosecution is not limited to civilian\npersonnel only.\nIt seems that different approaches in national criminal law do not help the\nconsistent punishment of nationals abroad who commit offences, nor the deter-\nmination of national jurisdiction related to international officers and the types of\ncrimes that would fall within the competence of national criminal courts.\n(ii) Universal jurisdiction\nVis-\u00e0-vis universal jurisdiction, the GLE identified both positive and negative\nelements. Sexual abuse and other related crimes, such as rape and enforced\nprostitution, are part of the conduct (actus reus) of crimes against humanity,224\nand grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.225 In the context of an\ninternational armed conflict, fundamental assaults on human health, physical in-\ntegrity and dignity are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.226 IHL pro-\nhibits acts of sexual violence in internal armed conflicts as well. Common Article\n3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions prohibits \u2018violence to life and person\u2019, \u2018cruel\ntreatment\u2019, \u2018torture\u2019 or \u2018other outrages upon personal dignity\u2019. Protocol II Add-\nitional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, governing the protection of civilians in\ninternal armed conflicts, explicitly refers to \u2018outrages upon personal dignity, in\nparticular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and\nany form of indecent assault\u2019.227 International criminal law also applies to sexual\nabuses in situations of armed conflict, even if committed for personal motives\nand not as part of a widespread policy.228\nAlso, there is an interesting relationship between the crime of torture, in-\nhuman and degrading treatment, and forms of sexual violence and abuse, and\neven enslavement. Some of these crimes may be linked to the alleged cases of\ntrafficking in persons,229 which have been denounced in some cases.230 Crimes\nagainst humanity can be committed by anyone, even if not affiliated officially to\na State and the ICC does not require the link between the act of torture and a\npublic official.231 In the opinion of the ICC rape and sexual violence may con-\n224 ICC Statute art 7(1)(g).\n225 ICC Statute art 8(2)(a).\n226 Grave breaches that are relevant in this case are specified in the four Geneva\nConventions (arts 50, 51, 130, 147 respectively) (Geneva 12 August 1949); see also\nSpecial Issue (2009) 7 J Intl Crim Justice.\n227 Additional Protocol II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, art 4(2)(e).\n228 ICTY Statute, art 5 (25 May 1993) 32 ILM 1192; Rome Statute (n 167) art 7; ICTR\nStatute, art 3, UNSC Res 955, UN Doc S\/RES\/955 (8 November 1994).

It is true that war crimes do not need that\nspecific element, and one rape would be enough to fit it into that category. How-\never, it may be excessive to use the reference to international crimes in the cases\nunder consideration. If they are considered war crimes, an armed conflict, either\ninternational or non-international, should be identified. In the case of PKOs it is\ndifficult to define the position of the parties in relation to the local conflict, un-\nless the UN troops do get involved, under their mandate, in the conduct of the\nhostilities.236\nThe position of the GLE in this context is to avoid the need to consider the\ncrimes as international crimes.237 This may be right, as if they were properly pro-\nsecuted by national competent authorities there should not be the need to find\ncomplex legal solutions, which are not fully accepted under current international\nlaw.\nHowever, there are concerns that certain crimes committed by peacekeepers\nare not \u2018merely ordinary crimes\u2019, because they are committed against the popu-\nlation that should be protected from abuses and widespread violence. The grav-\nity of those crimes would be based \u2018on the breach of what is akin to a\nrelationship of trust between the peacekeeper and the member of the commu-\nnity he or she is sent to protect and assist\u2019.238 Furthermore, there is an argument\nthat the criminal conduct would prejudice the \u2018credibility of the Organisation\n232 ICTR, Prosecutor v Akayesu (Judgment 2 September 1998) ICTR-96-4-T para 731;\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (23 May 1969) 1155 UNTS 331 art 53\n(1969) 8 ILM 679.\n233 ICTY, Prosecutor v Furundzija (10 December 1998) IT-95-17\/1-T paras 151 and 153;\nICJ, Belgium v Spain (Second Phase) [1970] ICJ Rep 3 para 33; M Cherif Bassiouni,\n\u2018International Crimes: \u201cJus Cogens\u201d and \u201cObligations Erga Omnes\u201d\u2019 (1996) 59 Law\nand Contemporary Problems 68.\n234 See ILC, Fifty-ninth Session, \u2018The Obligation to Extradite or Prosecute\u2019 (aut dedere\naut judicare), UN Doc A\/CN.4\/579 (5 March 2007).\n235 See Sweetser (n 9) 1656\u20139.\n236 See Human Rights Watch, \u2018You Will Be Punished\u2019 report (December 2009) <http:\/\/\nwww.hrw.org\/en\/node\/87142\/section\/2>.\n237 UN Doc A\/60\/980 (n 40) paras 57, 63(e), 71(a).\n238 Ibid para 55.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 33\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nand its important role in undertaking peacekeeping operations\u2019.239 If the second\nargument is more related to the consequences of the acts, the first one seems to\nprovide more room for legal discussion.\nIt is true that the position of the peacekeepers is different from that of the\nlocal population, as they have certain means and powers that put them in a situ-\nation of privilege. However, the reference to the \u2018trust\u2019 is a weak legal justifica-\ntion. It would be better to use more accepted concepts of criminal law to define\nextra responsibility for the members of UN PKOs. In criminal law there is a con-\ncept of aggravating circumstances when certain crimes are committed by people\nwho abuse their power or official authority. Another option would be to consider\nthat they have a \u2018duty of care\u2019, or commit an abuse of position of trust240 due to\ntheir institutional responsibilities, including the responsibility to protect241 exer-\ncised by the international community, which put them in a unique position in re-\nlation to the victims and to other people, whichmakes their crime ormisbehaviour\nparticularly odious. This option would provide a clearer base for accountability\nand it could be included in national criminal provisions concerning national\npersonnel acting abroad in peace operations.\n7. International Judicial Cooperation\nIn cases under consideration, it is particular important to define forms of judi-\ncial cooperation not only among States but also with IOs. Some States already\nhave in place forms of legal cooperation, mainly through bilateral extradition\ntreaties. The Australian Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987242\nallows discretionary cooperation with States but not with the UN.243 Similar pro-\nvisions exist in New Zealand,244 which do not bar New Zealand authorities from\nproviding assistance in case of requests from the UN. Other States have mani-\nfested a \u2018willingness\u2019 to facilitate investigations and prosecution involving UN\npersonnel and crimes of a serious nature.245 Some States do not exclude cooper-\nation with the UN but under national criminal law they would not be able to\ndisclose information regarding ongoing investigations.246\n239 Ibid paras 55, 56.\n240 UK, Sexual Offences Act 2003 (c 42) s 16.\n241 International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, The Responsibil-\nity to Protect: The Report of the International Commission on Intervention and State\nSovereignty (International Development Research Centre, Ottawa 2001); see SC\nBreau, \u2018The Impact of the Responsibility to Protect on Peacekeeping\u2019 (2006) 11\nJCSL 429.\n242 Australia, Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 (Cth) Act no 85 of 1978.\n243 Australia, Crimes (Overseas) Act 1964, no 116 of 1964, amended by Act no 73 of 2008.\n244 New Zealand, Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1992 no 86 (Royal Assent\n25 September 1992) part 3.\n245 For instance Belgium, UN Doc A\/63\/260 para 39.\n246 Czech Republic, Code of Criminal Procedure, Act No 141\/1961 (1995), No 141 (no\n152), s 376, ibid para 42.\n34 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nArticle 10 of the Draft Convention defines the areas of cooperation, including\ninvestigations, criminal and extradition proceedings, and assistance in obtaining\nevidence. The article clarifies that cooperation shall be based on existing ar-\nrangements on mutual legal assistance, and that in the case of absence of such\nagreements, \u2018States parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance\nwith their national law\u2019.\nExtradition is a well-established practice of cooperation between States to en-\nsure prosecution of alleged criminals. Extradition treaties define the crimes that\ncan be the object of request for extradition. Article 8 of the Draft Convention\nsuggests that in cases of crimes defined in Article 3, if they are not already in-\ncluded in an extradition treaty, they should be incorporated in existing treaties\nand in any future treaty. Some States consent to extradition when a treaty is in\nforce with the State formulating the request. In the absence of a treaty, the Draft\nConvention recommends that States Parties should consider the Draft Conven-\ntion, once entered into force, as the legal basis for extradition. Nevertheless, cer-\ntain specific conditions under national247 and international law, such as fair\ntreatment and trial, based on human rights standards, may still apply.\nOther forms of cooperation foreseen by theDraft Convention include the trans-\nfer of criminal proceedings between States \u2018in cases where such transfer is consid-\nered to be in the interests of the proper administration of justice\u2019;248 the transfer of\nprisoners in order to complete their sentence in a different country;249 and cooper-\nation in the context of use of evidence obtained in the host State also in the case of\nadministrative investigation conducted by the UN.250 Cooperation includes also\nthe fact that the State Party that prosecutes the alleged offender shall communi-\ncate the final outcome of the proceedings to the Secretary-General, who shall\ntransmit that information to all the other States Parties and to the host State.251\nA. Investigation\nThe Zeid Report bluntly states that \u2018those who violate United Nations standards\nneed to be punished\u2019.252 The report identifies some problems in dealing with\nproper investigation of alleged cases. It is clearly recognized that the presump-\ntion of innocence as a general principle of criminal law should apply, in particular\nby the D PKO, which is usually in charge of a \u2018preliminary investigation\u2019. The\nenquiry procedure for civilian police officers and military observers is based on\ntwo phases, a \u2018preliminary investigation\u2019253 and a subsequent \u2018board of inquiry\u2019\n247 2006 Draft Convention (n 44) art 8(2) and (3).\n248 Ibid art 11.\n249 Ibid art 12.\n250 Ibid art 16.\n251 Ibid art 17.\n252 \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) para 28.\n253 UNDPKO, \u2018Directives for Disciplinary Matters Involving Civilian Police Officers and\nMilitary Observers\u2019 (2003) DPKO\/CPD\/DDCPO\/2003\/001, DPKO\/MD\/03\/00994,\nparas 11\u201314.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 35\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \ndecision. If from the investigation it appears that a serious misconduct254 is well\nfounded, the head of mission shall establish a board of inquiry.255 Similar proce-\ndures are applied to UN staff, but in case of well-founded misconduct emerging\nfrom the preliminary investigation the matter is passed to the Assistant Secre-\ntary-General for Human Resources Management.256 Issues related to investiga-\ntions were addressed in a 2004 OIOS report.257 For investigation purposes,\nOIOS has grouped allegations into Category I258 and Category II,259 depending\non the risk such cases present to the UN. However, the report does not define\nthe meaning of \u2018risk\u2019. It may represent a danger to the progress of the operation,\nor a threat to the security of its personnel and infrastructure. The Office of Hu-\nman Resources Management in the Department of Management may adopt dis-\nciplinary measures for UN civilian personnel. Evidence and procedures adopted\nby the board of inquiry, as an organ of investigation in UN missions, do not fol-\nlow proper legal and judicial proceedings, and the documentation gathered is not\nmade available because of the UN \u2018policy of not releasing documents that might\nbe used by third parties to make claims against the Organization\u2019.260 When alle-\ngations of serious misconduct concern military and police personnel, the UN\nmay repatriate the individuals concerned and ban them from future PKOs. How-\never, disciplinary sanctions and any other judicial actions remain the responsibil-\nity of the national jurisdiction of the individual involved.\nThe Zeid Report formulates two main suggestions regarding the investiga-\ntion procedures. The first one focuses on establishing a more professional in-\n254 Misconduct is defined as \u2018Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obliga-\ntions under the Charter of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and the Staff\nRules or other relevant administrative issuances, or to observe the standards of con-\nduct expected of an international civil servant, may amount to misconduct and may\nlead to the institution of a disciplinary process and the imposition of disciplinary mea-\nsures for misconduct\u2019 (2003) SG Bulletin (n 34) Rule 10.1(a).\n255 UNDPKO (n 253) paras 15-22.\n256 UN, \u2018Revised Disciplinary Measures and Procedures\u2019 (2 August 1991) UN Doc ST\/\nAI\/371.\n257 UN, \u2018Report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on Strengthening the Inves-\ntigation Functions in the United Nations\u2019 (10 February 2004) UN Doc A\/58\/708.\n258 Category I includes: all sexual exploitation and abuses offences including rape, trans-\nactional sex, exploitative relationships and sexual abuse, cases involving risk of loss of\nlife to staff or to others, abuse of authority or staff, conflict of interest, gross misman-\nagement, bribery\/corruption, illegal mineral trade, trafficking with prohibited goods,\nlife threat\/murder, abuse or torture of detainees, arms trade, physical assault, forgery,\nembezzlement, major theft\/fraud, use, possession or distribution of illegal narcotics,\nwaste of substantial resources, entitlement fraud and procurement violations, ibid para\n26.\n259 Category II includes: discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, abuse of author-\nity, abusive behaviour, basic misuse of equipment or staff, simple theft\/ fraud, infrac-\ntions of regulations, rules or administrative issuances, traffic-related violations,\nconduct that could bring the UN into disrepute, breaking curfew, contract disputes\nand basic mismanagement, ibid para 27.\n260 \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) para 28.\n36 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nvestigative mechanism, in particular when dealing with criminal allegations.261\nThe new mechanism might include a permanent professional capacity linked\nto the DPKO, but maintaining total independence from the command struc-\nture of the Department. It could be based on a regional structure, and it\nwould replace the preliminary investigation and the board of inquiry.262 This\nwould make available a permanent and less expensive structure. It would also\nprovide a professional procedure based on the fundamental rules of criminal\nlaw, protecting the rights of individuals who are accused of individual crimes.\nRegarding military personnel, the Zeid Report suggests that the TCC should\nparticipate in the investigation process. A military lawyer, preferably a prosecu-\ntor, with knowledge of national military law, could support the investigation and\nassist in the collection of relevant material for further national prosecution. This\nprovision should be included in the UN model MoU, which could incorporate\nthe obligation for the TCC to nominate a military prosecutor easily deployable,\nat short notice, to the mission to assist the DPKO investigations.263\nA second suggestion includes the possibility of establishing on-site court\nmartial systems \u2018for serious offences that are criminal in nature\u2019.264 This option\nwould facilitate access to witnesses and the acquisition of evidence in the mission\narea. The report raises some doubts regarding the opportunity of having a court\nmartial in the host State, which might generate some problems. However, this\nproblem seems to be solved under paragraph 47(b) of the Model SOFA, which\nprovides the exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute military components of the mis-\nsion to the States of origin. According to the report, the establishment of a for-\neign court martial would be implied in that provision. Nevertheless, the set of\ninvestigative powers that could be used in this case is not clear. For instance,\nwhether foreign police officers and investigative authorities could search, arrest\nand interrogate alleged accused and witnesses, and the forms of cooperation\nwith the local police and the judicial authorities. Those issues should be further\ndefined, as some States might not easily agree to allow foreign investigative and\njudicial bodies to act on their territory, under foreign authority, and possibly con-\ncerning their own citizens.\nRules of criminal procedure are quite detailed in all major legal systems,\nparticularly with regard to the right to a fair trial. It should be noted that such\nspecific rules are not defined in the documents that presently regulate UN\npersonnel. The adoption of international rules of criminal procedure might be\na quite complex issue, even if the rules adopted by international criminal juris-\ndictions could provide a good framework. However, their applicability to UN\nPKOs might need further negotiations regarding specific rules applicable to\nthem, with a process that would still limit the judicial action with the ratification\nof UN Member States.\n261 In particular when dealing with sexual exploitation, and abuse, sex crime investigation\ninvolving children, and access to modern forensic methods, ibid para 36.\n262 Ibid paras 31\u20132.\n263 Ibid paras 33\u20134.\n264 Ibid para 35.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 37\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nB. Organizational, Managerial and Command Accountability\nThere is a perception that \u2018neither the Organization nor its civilian managers\nand military commanders\u2019 show particular efforts and\/or are held accountable\nfor addressing sexual exploitation and abuse in PKOs.265 The Zeid Report pro-\nvides mainly organizational and managerial suggestions for the running of the\nmissions. Some essential measures include the raising of the awareness among\nUN and related personnel about sexual abuse, which is defined in the 2003 SG\nBulletin.266 Suggested actions include: intensive training of peacekeepers before,\nat arrival and during the mission; links to local communities to assist the submis-\nsion of individual complaints; collection of data concerning abuses267 and re-\nsponses by each mission; the possibility of including full-time personnel\nconduct officers, on the examples of operations in Burundi, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, the\nDRC and Haiti; and an increase in the number of female military personnel,\nincluding at senior level, to discourage sexual exploitation.268\nSome provisions already exist in this area of concern, such as the prohibition,\nunder UN standards of conduct,269 of sexual activity with prostitutes. However,\nthe report identifies a problem when peacekeepers are provided with condoms\nunder action by the DPKO and the Joint UN Programme on HIV\/AIDS. There-\nfore a confused and contradictory message seems to be passed to the personnel.\nClearer messages should be sent to soldiers, taking into account the 2003 SG\nBulletin.

Individual Disciplinary, Financial and Criminal Accountability\nThere have been some cases in which national authorities have penalized their\npersonnel, under their military and\/or criminal justice systems, who have en-\ngaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including dismissal from the military,\ncustodial sentences and loss of rank.276 France, for example, has reportedly im-\nprisoned one of its peacekeepers for filming himself having sex with children,\nwhile countries including Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa and Tunisia\nhave announced disciplinary action against some of their peacekeepers.277 The\ngovernment of Morocco convicted four soldiers serving as UN peacekeepers for\nengaging in trafficking.278\nThe problem identified in the Zeid Report is the widespread perception that\nmembers of PKOs who commit sexual abuses \u2018rarely if ever face disciplinary\ncharges for such acts and, at most, suffer administrative consequences\u2019.279 It\nis particularly worrying that the Report affirms that \u2018such perceptions are not\nwithout foundation\u2019.280 There are several reasons that in, part, justify this situ-\nation. Some have been mentioned before, regarding the investigation proced-\nure. Two other reasons are mentioned in this section: (i) the reluctance of States\nto admit that their troops commit such crimes, and (ii) the lack, in many areas\nwhere UN personnel are employed, of a reliable legal system, that could permit\nlocal prosecution, after the UN Secretary-General had waived the immunities\nof staff accused of serious offences.281 Due to this complex situation, the report\nprovides a set of options based on disciplinary, financial and individual criminal\naccountability.\nRegarding disciplinary measures, there may be different types of sanctions,\ndepending whether the personnel are UN staff or military members of national\ncontingents. UN staff who violate the 2003 SG Bulletin standards should be sub-\nject to disciplinary action, unless the Secretary-General accepts \u2018an immediate\nresignation\u2019 and the individual concerned would be never re-employed by the\nUN.282 These provisions are based on Staff Regulations and Rules, which give\nthese powers to the Secretary-General as head of the UN administration.283 Re-\ngarding similar violations by civilian police, military observers and other civilian\npersonnel the Report suggests that their contracts should be terminated. For\nmilitary personnel, the Report suggested an amendment to the model MoU to\ninclude a clear obligation for TCCs to institute disciplinary action and appropri-\nate legal proceedings, a measure later adopted in 2006.284\n276 UNGA Res A\/61\/645 (n 140) para 37.\n277 MJ Jordan, \u2018UN Tackles Sex Abuse by Troops\u2019 Christian Science Monitor (21 June\n2005), <http:\/\/www.csmonitor.com\/2005\/0621\/p06s02-wogi.html>.\n278 Trafficking in Persons Report (United States Department of State 2006) 184.\n279 \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) para 66.\n280 Ibid para 66.\n281 Ibid para 67.\n282 Ibid para 68.\n283 UN, \u2018Staff Regulations\u2019 (n 122) Rule 10.1 and 10.3.\n284 See s 7.A.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 39\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nFinancial accountability is also taken into consideration, not only as a form of\nsanction, but as a means to provide assistance to acknowledged victims.285 The\nReport mentions the so-called phenomenon of \u2018peacekeeper babies\u2019, who result\nfrom relationships between local women and UN peacekeepers. Recommenda-\ntions are based on existing UN Staff Rules which permit the imposition of fines on\nstaff members who are guilty of misconduct. The suggestion is that fines imposed\nfor violations of the 2003 SG Bulletin should be sent to a voluntary Trust Fund for\nVictims to provide assistance to victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by UN\npeacekeepers.286 Amendments should be added to relevant documents to extend\nthese measures to civilian police and military observers.287 For national military\ncontingents, the report suggests that the daily allowance of soldiers found guilty\nof sexual crimes should be collected through national authorities,288 so that finan-\ncial support could be provided to the victims. It is stressed, under the 1999 SG\nBulletin on \u2018Family and Child Support Obligations of Staff Members\u2019,289 that\nthe UN is authorized to honour court orders against UN staff members for family\nsupport.290 In this case Section 2.2 of the 1999 SG Bulletin clearly affirms that:\nIn accordance with staff regulation 1.1 (f), the privileges and immunities\nof the United Nations are conferred in the interests of the Organization\nand furnish no excuse to staff members who are covered by them for the\nnon-performance of their private legal obligations.\nThis provision indicates that certain limitations to immunities and privileges of\nthe UN staff are allowed, and they impose duties on UN staff that can be imple-\nmented under the law.\nThe report also suggests practical measures to support and assist the mother of\na peacekeeper baby. They include the request of a DNA test for UN staff, and in\nthe case of a positive result, the possibility of financial help deducted from the\nUN staff member at dismissal,291 based on his salary income, pension or other\nfinancial sanction that can be applied by the State of nationality. In the case of\nmilitary contingents, the report suggests that the UN should provide help for\nmothers to file claims that would be transmitted to the TCC for consideration\nin its legal system.292\nIndividual criminal accountability is also considered. Suggestions are offered\nfor two types of peacekeeping personnel: military members of contingents and\nUN staff and experts on mission. This distinction is based on the fact that the\n285 See Sweetser (n 9) 1661-160.\n286 \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) paras 71 and 56.\n287 Ibid para 71.\n288 Ibid para 75.\n289 UN SG Bulletin, \u2018Family and Child Support Obligations of Staff Members\u2019 (20 May\n1999) UN Doc ST\/SGB\/1999\/4.\n290 Ibid ss 2.1, 4.1 and 4.2.\n291 \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) para 76.\n292 Ibid para 77.\n40 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nMoU provides that military personnel in PKOs are subject to the exclusive\ncriminal authority of the TCC.293 However, under the practice established by\nthe Model UN SOFA, States should provide formal assurances that they would\nexercise jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed in the mission area.294\nThe Report regrets that the practice mentioned295 is no longer used by the\nUN, and it should be clearly reinserted to guarantee a legal obligation for\nStates towards the UN.\nIn general, the Zeid Report underlined the lack of support in the investigative\npart by different components of the mission. The enquiry revealed problems of\ntransparency and affected genuine cooperation by States. It is important to note\nthat this attitude does not help the cause of justice and to clarify the responsi-\nbility of those individuals responsible for grave abuses. The Report suggests a\nset of possible remedies. First of all the Special Committee should request the\nSecretary-General to obtain formal assurances regarding the exercise of their\njurisdiction when a DPKO investigation has well-founded allegations against a\nmilitary member of a mission.296 Secondly, if national authorities do not pros-\necute, they should submit a report to the Secretary-General explaining why\nprosecution was not appropriate. Thirdly, that the GA makes this procedure\n\u2018an essential condition for acceptance of an offer from a troop-contributing\ncountry to supply troops to the UN\u2019.297 Finally, to monitor the compliance with\nthe mentioned rules, the Secretary-General should indicate, in its annual report\nto the Special Committee the actions taken by troop-contributing States, and in\na separate part of the report indicate the details of cases that were not properly\naddressed, indicating the name of the contributing country, without revealing\nthe identity of individual members of the contingent.298 The report considers\nthat these measures would show that the UN and States do not \u2018tolerate acts\nof sexual exploitation and abuse by military members of their contingents\u2019.299\nSince 2007 the Secretary-General has submitted a report to the GA regarding\ndata on investigations into sexual exploitation and related offences.300 In 2007\nthe GA adopted a \u2018Comprehensive Strategy on Assistance and Support to Vic-\ntims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by United Nations Staff and Related\nPersonnel\u2019,301 \u2018to ensure that victims of sexual exploitation and abuse by United\nNations staff and related personnel receive appropriate assistance and support in\n293 2007 Revised MoU (n 63) art 7(1) quinqiens.\n294 UN Doc A\/45\/594 (n 82) annex para 48.\n295 For example, it mentions an exchange of letters between the Secretary-General and\nFinland of 21 and 27 June 1957, where formal assurances were given by Finland that it\nwould exercise jurisdiction over any of its contingents assigned to the UN Emergency\nForce who committed crimes in the peacekeeping area (UNTS vol 271, 135).\n296 \u2018Comprehensive Strategy\u2019 (n 10) para 78.\n297 Ibid para 81.\n298 Ibid para 82.\n299 Ibid para 83.\n300 UN Doc A\/61\/957 (15 June 2007).\n301 UNGA Res 62\/214 (7 March 2008).\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 41\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \na timely manner\u2019302 with particular attention \u2018to assist and support complainants,\nvictims and children born as a result of sexual exploitation and abuse by United\nNations staff and related personnel\u2019.303\n8. Conclusions\nThe UN is actively adopting new measures to address misconduct by peace-\nkeepers that amount to criminal acts. It is very important to identify and pros-\necute individuals who are responsible for violations that infringe fundamental\nrights, not only to ensure the consistent action of UN missions, but also to avoid\ntensions with local communities that may compromise the success of a PKO. The\npurpose of PKOs, in the context of either the UN or other international organi-\nzations, is to protect individuals in situations of extraordinary suffering.304 As\npointed out by Radhika Coomaraswamy, Special Rapporteur on Violence\nagainst Women, the UN would lose \u2018its moral force if it fails to respond when\nthose within the United Nations system violate human rights\u2019.305 Furthermore,\nthere is a risk that the UN and other IOs that do not address the issue of immun-\nities in cases of human rights violations might be considered to be authorizing\nsuch violations, in particular when victims are not provided access to adequate\nremedies.306 Some cases have already pointed out the importance of addressing\nthe system of international immunities with regard to responsibility of IOs.307\nThe analysed documents make special reference to enhancing cooperation\nbetween States and the UN, and reaffirm the general obligations to respect\nthe principles of international law related to the protection of human rights.\nActions include policy-oriented strategies, administrative powers of control\nexercised by States and by UN bodies, and the fundamental willingness of\nStates to exercise jurisdiction in alleged cases of crimes committed by na-\ntionals who serve in UN PKOs. This would also include strengthening train-\ning activities for staff who are sent to peace missions.308 Training should\ninform about legal limitation of immunities, the State\u2019s jurisdiction, the defini-\n302 Ibid annex para 1.\n303 Ibid para 4.\n304 ICISS report (n 241); UN \u2018Implementing the Responsibility to Protect\u2019 (12 January\n2009) UN Doc A\/63\/677.\n305 Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, \u2018Integration of the Human Rights of\nWomen and the Gender Perspective: Violence Against Women\u2019 (29 February 2000)\nUN Doc E\/CN.4\/2000\/68 para 59.\n306 Sweetser (n 9) 1675.\n307 ECtHR, Waite v Geramny (App no 260\/94, 1991-I) (1999) para 68; Markovic v Italy\n(App no 1398\/03) Judgment (Merits) (14 December 2006) paras 1\u20138; Wo\u015b v Poland\n(App no 22860\/02) Judgment (Merits and Just Satisfaction) (8 September 2006)\npara 98.\n308 UN Security Council Res 1325 (2000) recognized \u2018the importance of \u2026 specialized\ntraining for all peacekeeping personnel on the protection, special needs and human\nrights of women and children in conflict situations\u2019.\n42 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \ntions of crimes, the criminal consequences and the fundamental guarantees\nthat alleged perpetrators must enjoy.\nSeveral measures should be adopted to clarify the legal uncertainties that still\nsurround the practical prosecution of UN personnel in cases of misbehaviour.\nDue to the lack of UN police and judiciary, there is a need to clarify and imple-\nment the obligations of Member States in dealing with the investigation and\nprosecution, rather than codify new rules. The crimes and misbehaviour of\nUN peacekeepers should be identified, probably through a relevant UN body,\nsuch as the DPKO. The acts under consideration identified as misbehaviour\nare essentially of a criminal nature. They may not reach the qualification of inter-\nnational crimes, but there would be no need to use this option if States applied\nstandard criminal law effectively. However, the role of international criminal\ncourts should be considered only as a subsidiary option, and only for those\ncrimes that have been internationally defined, such as torture. Even in that case,\nthe possible prosecution by international courts, including the ICC, seems too\nremote and illusory.\nOnce the UN competent bodies have identified the types of crime that should\nbe prosecuted, States contributing personnel for PKOs should include them in\nnational criminal law, in military criminal codes, and should define the exercise\nof national jurisdiction on crimes and misbehaviour committed by nationals\nwhile serving in peace operations of international organizations. A second na-\ntional measure would be the clarification of extradition and judicial cooperation\namong States and the UN when dealing with the prosecution of those crimes.\nSome clarification should also be provided regarding the possible deadline for\nprosecution and the possible consequences in case of failure to investigate and\nprosecute to avoid forms of hidden impunity.\nA special burden should be put on commanders of national contingents, be-\ncause in cases concerning military and police personnel, these issues should be\npart of the disciplinary measures under the responsibility of national officers in\nthe field. The revised 2007 MoU includes some improvements, providing an ob-\nligation for each commander of a contingent with the authority to ensure com-\npliance with UN standards, local laws and regulations.309 However, there are no\nclear consequences for the commander who does not act properly. Reforms of\nthe SOFAs and SOMAs between the national State and the host State should\ninclude realistic and feasible mechanisms for the prosecution of UN PKO\npersonnel in case of alleged violations.\nAt international level, the Draft Convention might provide some further as-\nsistance. However, it would be relevant to clarify the issues of limitations on im-\nmunities for UN personnel, and the procedure for dealing with cases of criminal\nconduct, in the case of inaction by the State of nationality of the individual.\nWhen certain criminal acts also imply human rights violations, it would be rele-\nvant to clarify the level of responsibility of the UN and of the sending State. This\n309 2007 Revised MoH (n 63) annex H.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 43\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nis particularly important when UN officers are also national officers, for the\nproper attribution of responsibility in dealing with the victims of abuse.\nIt is necessary to set limitations on immunities and the conditions under which\nthey must be suspended or waived. This implies also a definition of crimes that\noutweigh the immunities, the conditions for the exercise of criminal jurisdiction\nand the competent authority. The Secretary-General may decide to waive the im-\nmunity of an official who works for the UN but it is important to clarify which\nState would have jurisdiction in the specific case. Definitions of forms of subsid-\niary jurisdiction when a State is not exercising criminal jurisdiction on its nationals\nare also relevant, and national legislation should be enacted to support adequate\ninvestigation and prosecution. Once an independent investigative body has found\nreasonable grounds for prosecution,310 the jurisdiction should be exercised in the\norder defined by the GLE. These measures would avoid legal gaps and proced-\nural loopholes that allow forms of impunity for crimes committed abroad.\nIt is also important to strengthen independent investigation to ensure the\nprinciple of presumption of innocence. The establishment since 2005 of Conduct\nand Discipline Units311 in UN Headquarters and in several peace missions may\nfurther support this effort. They address issues such as preventing misconduct,\nhandling complaints and data management and ensuring compliance with UN\nstandards of conduct, even if they do not conduct investigations, which are\nhandled by the UNs\u2019 OIOS. It has been suggested that independent Civil Pro-\nvosts should be appointed in UN missions to enhance collaboration with the host\nState\u2019s criminal justice system.312 However, priority should be given to the clari-\nfication of the legal conundrum because procedural and enforcement mechan-\nisms would help to support the application of legal rules more effectively, and\nnot vice versa.\nFinally, it would be appropriate to establish a more stringent monitoring me-\nchanism. Since 2007 the UN has collected relevant information on alleged vio-\nlations and Member States\u2019 actions to deal with them.313 This information is\npresently published in a Secretary-General report to the GA.314 The annual re-\nports mention statistical data, but they do not refer to specific countries and to\ntheir personnel. There should be some form of further scrutiny, possibly within\na UN human rights body, such as the Human Rights Council, as the main UN\nhuman rights institution, for its consideration of national implementation. Sug-\ngestion could be provided by the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee\n310 See Durch et al (n 9) 60\u20135.\n311 UN, \u2018UN Establishes Peacekeeping Conduct and Discipline Units\u2019, Press Release,\nPKO 120 (3 August 2005).\n312 Ibid 60.\n313 As part of UN efforts to improve transparency, the DPKO and Department of Field\nSupport (DFS) will issue quarterly press releases to make public updated statistics\nregarding sexual exploitation and abuse cases. The statistics will be updated simultan-\neously on the Conduct and Discipline website <http:\/\/cdu.unlb.org\/> see UN Press\nReleases and Statements (New York 5 February 2010).\n314 See UN Doc A\/61\/957 (15 June 2007); A\/62\/890 (25 June 2008); A\/63\/720 (17 February\n2009).\n44 Marco Odello\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nwhich could recommend implementation-oriented mechanisms. Of course, not all\nmisconducts are human rights abuses, and those acts would occur outside the ter-\nritory of the State involved. However, with regard to human rights violations, this\nmight help the international scrutiny regarding national compliance with human\nrights law, including the extraterritorial application of human rights norms, and it\nwould underline the UN commitment to enforce and protect human rights as part\nof its mandate under the Charter.\nIt should be stressed that misbehaviour and criminal conduct should be dealt\nwith primarily by appropriate criminal and disciplinary measures. If members of\nnational contingents and UN personnel were investigated and prosecuted with-\nout delay, the risk of misbehaviour would probably be reduced. One of the func-\ntions of criminal law is the prevention of crime through the certainty of the\nsanction. From the information now available, it seems that abuses by peace-\nkeepers have been ignored for too long, leaving room for the presumption of\nimpunity hidden under immunity. There is now a significant awareness and inter-\nnational concern on this matter and the UN seems to take it seriously. More\naction and cooperation are needed by Member States, who cannot complain\nabout the inefficiency of the UN when they themselves are not using appropriate\nnational judicial mechanisms to deal with the criminal behaviour of their officers\nand citizens.\nTackling Criminal Acts in Peacekeeping Operations 45\n at O\npen U\nniversity on A\nugust 31, 2012\nhttp:\/\/jcsl.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n"}
