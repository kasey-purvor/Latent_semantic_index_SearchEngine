Lett A 97, 95-98 (1983).\nIn this letter we report the results of an essentially experimental investigation of a\nmodel noise induced phase transition (NIPT) from the detailed points of view provided by\ntwo theoretical interpretations (due to Ito and Stratonovich) of the white noise process.\nMuch has been written regarding these interpretations, and in the words of Van Kampen\n\u201c ... the discussion [sic] continues and threatens to grow to grotesque proportions\u201d. The\ninterested reader will find a clear and succinct review in his papers [1]. Others [2, 3]\nhave also contributed, but our citations here are by no means complete. A fundamental\nwork is the paper by Mortensen [4]. Unfortunately \u201cthe discussion\u201d has been carried\non exclusively by theoreticians. At the risk of further inflating the already grotesque\nproportions, we wish to contribute the first (to our knowledge) experimental measurements\nable to distinguish between predictions based on the two interpretations. Our results are\nin substantial agreement with the views propounded by Van Kampen [1] and by West et\nal. [3], for the case of a dynamical system subject to external, multiplicative noise.\nNIPTs were first studied by Horsthemke and Lefever [5-7] in certain model, nonlinear\nsystems subject to environmental noise. They found that in such systems new, statistically\nfavored, stationary states, which were unknown to the deterministic system, appear when\nthe noise intensity exceeds some critical value. Here we shall exploit the fact that the Ito\nand Stratonovich interpretations lead to different predictions for the value of this critical\nnoise intensity.\nWe are interested in the NIPT which appears in a genetic model [6] represented by\ndX\/dt =\n1\n2\n\u2212X + \u03bbtX(1\u2212X), (1)\nwhere the external noise appears as the parameter \u03bbt \u2192 \u03bb + \u03c3\u03bet. We take \u3008\u03bbt\u3009 = \u03bb and\n\u03bet\u03bet+\u03c4 = \u03b4(\u03c4) so that \u03c3\u03bet is a gaussian, white noise of variance \u03c3\n2, zero mean, and is\nthe derivative of the Wiener process Wt. Eq. (1) thus becomes a stochastic differential\nequation\ndX = f(X,\u03bb)dt+ \u03c3g(X)dWt (2)\nwhere f(X,\u03bb) = 1\n2\n\u2212 X + \u03bbX(1 \u2212 X), and g(X) = X(1 \u2212 X) for our model. Van\nKampen has pointed out that eq. (2) is meaningless (he calls it a \u201cpre-equation\u201d) until\na prescription on how to integrate the second term on the right is adopted. If G(Wi)\nis a function of the Wiener process, then the Ito convention is represented by a limit of\nthe sum of finite differences, \u03a3G(Wi\u22121)(Wi \u2212Wi\u22121), where the function G is evaluated\nat the left hand point Wi\u22121. The Stratonovich convention instead adopts a symmetric\nevaluation point, \u03a3G[(Wi + Wi\u22121)\/2][Wi \u2212Wi\u22121]. These sums have different limits and\n2\nlead to different versions of the Fokker-Planck equation. The Ito version reads\n\u2202t\u03c1(X, t) = \u2212\u2202Xf(X)\u03c1(X, t) + 1\n2\n\u03c32\u22022Xg\n2(X)\u03c1(X, t), (3)\nand the Stratonovich is\n\u2202t\u03c1(X, t) = \u2212\u2202X\n(\nf +\n1\n2\n\u03c32g\u2032g\n)\n\u03c1+\n1\n2\n\u03c32\u22022Xg\n2\u03c1 (4)\nwhere \u03c1(X, t) is the time dependent probability density, and g\u2032 = \u2202Xg(X). These have\nthe wellknown stationary (\u2202t\u03c1 = 0) solutions\n\u03c1s = cg\n\u2212\u03bd exp\n(\n(2\/\u03c32)\n\u222b X\n[f(z)\/g2(z)]dz\n)\n, (5)\nwhere \u03bd = 2 (1) in the Ito (Stratonovich) versions, and c is a normalization constant.\nFor our model, eq. (5) results in\n\u03c1s = [X(1\u2212X)]\u2212\u03bd \u00d7 exp{\u2212[2X(1\u2212X)]\u22121 \u2212 \u03bb ln[(1\u2212X)\/X]} \u00d7 (2\/\u03c32) (6)\nwhich exhibits a single peak for \u03c3 < \u03c3c and a double peak for \u03c3 > \u03c3c. For \u03bb = 0 the graph\nof \u03c1s is symmetric about X = 1\/2, and \u03c3\n(0)\nc =\n\u221a\n2 (2), in the Ito (Stratonovich) versions.\nFor |\u03bb| > 0, one peak is enhanced and \u03c3c > \u03c3(0)c . The phase diagram is the locus of \u03c3c(\u03bb).\nWe have digitally integrated eq. (1) using a finite difference approximation resembling\nthe Ito prescription,\nXn+1 \u2212Xn = \u2206Xn =\n(\n1\n2\n\u2212Xn\n)\n\u2206t+ \u03b2tnXn(1\u2212Xn), (7)\nwhere a new \u03b2tn is chosen for each n from a gaussian distribution with mean value \u03bb\nand variance \u03c32\u2206t. A set of N values Xt are generated from each term in the time\nseries Xt = X0 +\n\u2211N\nn=1 \u2206Xn and the frequency that Xt visited the interval between X\nand X + \u2206X was computed on the range 0 \u2264 X < 1 and stored. For N sufficiently\nlarge, this average frequency distribution \u2192 \u03c1s. Typically, N = 2 \u00d7 105, \u2206X = 0.012,\nand \u2206t = 0.05. X0 was invariably chosen as the steady state solution of eq. (1) for the\ndeterministic (\u03c3 = 0) case,\nX0 = (1\/2\u03bb)[\u03bb\u2212 1 + (1 + \u03bb2)1\/2], (8)\nto minimize initial transient effects. Some example densities from this simulation are\nshown in fig. 1(a) where for \u03bb = 0 it is clear that \u03c3\n(0)\nc is consistent with the Ito prediction.\nFig. 1(b) shows examples for |\u03bb| > 0. By computing many such densities for various\n3\nchoices of X we were able to generate the simulated data shown in the phase diagram,\nfig. 2, by the solid circles. The error bars were estimated from the difficulty of identifying\nthat density with a range of ' zero slope. The calculated result, shown by the solid curve\nmarked \u201cIto\u201d, was obtained from eq. (6) (with \u03bd = 2). The agreement is quite good\nconsidering the approximate nature of the simulation. No adjustable parameters were\nused either in generating the simulated data or the theoretical curve. We believe this\ndemonstrates that the Ito formulation is correct from a mathematical point of view. It\ndoes not, however, tell us how nature actually behaves.\nThe authors of refs. [1,3] reach identical conclusions: Since the Stratonovich represen-\ntation can be shown to result from the white noise limit of a real noise (i.e. band limited\nor nonzero time correlated) problem [8,9], then it should accurately describe the results of\nexperiments on real dynamical systems. We have found this conclusion to be absolutely\ncorrect by actually measuring density functions on a real analogue simulator of eq. (I),\ndriven by real noise. The noise correlation time was, however, much smaller than the\ndynamical response times of the system within the range over which the simulator was\noperated, so that a white noise description is expected to be a good approximation.\nThe simulator is shown in fig. 3. It is constructed entirely of analogue components\nexcept for the computer, which functions simply as an instrument for measuring and\naveraging the density of the noisy voltage X(t). All sum and difference operations, as well\nas the two integrations are accomplished with quite standard operational amplifier circuits.\nThe two multiplications were done with commercially available analogue multipliers\u2217.\nThe simulator is accurate to ' 3.8% in the sense that its steady state response with\n\u03c3 = 0 is in agreement with eq. (7). The slow integrator has a time constant of 3 s, and\nserves to stabilize the circuit on \u3008X(t)\u3009 ' X0. We found that if the time constant was\nreduced much below about 1 s, the accuracy was seriously impaired. The bandwidth of\nthe slow integrator is therefore so narrow that the noise at its output is reduced by a\nfactor ' 2\u00d7 10\u22124. The noise f(X, t)\u2020 was independently integrated by the fast integrator\nand subsequently added to \u3008X(t)\u3009 at the output, so that X(t) = \u3008X(t)\u3009 + \u222b f(X, t)dt.\nThe circuit was designed with a scale factor of unity, so that X(t) in volts is numerically\ncomparable to the results of eqs. (l) and (7).\nThe densities were measured by digitizing 4096 points in a time series of the voltage\nX(t). The frequency that X(t) visited the region between X and X + \u2206X was then\n\u2217Analog Devices, type AD534, Norwood MA 02062, USA.\n\u2020Electrical engineers will recognize this closed loop circuit as a servo mechanism with error signal\nf(X, t). Therefore when \u3008X(t)\u3009 \u2261 X0 then \u3008X(t)\u3009 \u2261 0, and this self regulation process operates on a\ntime scale determined by the slow integrator time constant.\n4\ncomputed for 0 \u2264 X < 1. The first time series was erased and a second obtained with the\nsecond frequency being added to the first. This process was repeated, typically 2048 times,\nwhence the average frequency \u2192 \u03c1s(X). Examples are shown in fig. 4 by the continuous\ncurves compared to the calculated results (solid circles) from eq. (6). Fig. 4(a) shows a\nmeasurement for \u03c3 ' \u03c3c = 2 compared to the Stratonovich result (flat curve) and the\nIto result (double peaks) calculated for the same \u03c3. Fig. 4(b) shows examples for \u03c3 < \u03c3c\nand \u03c3 > \u03c3c where the calculated results are always Stratonovich. For each value of \u03bb, we\nwere able to find \u03c3 ' \u03c3c by searching for a density with a single region of approximately\nzero slope which separated the single peak set from the double peak set. The results are\nshown in fig. 2 by the open circles, and are in excellent agreement with the Stratonovich\nphase diagram.\nWe found that these results were independent of the correlation time of the noise, so\nlong as this was kept smaller than about 3 ms. (Most of the data were obtained with the\nnoise generator band limited to an upper cutoff frequency of 300 Hz, though we tested\nthe results for cutoffs as low as 60 Hz and as high as 1500 Hz.) This result indicates that\nthe dynamical system sees the noise as approximately white. In addition, changing the\ntime constant of the fast integrator only caused a change in the noise amplitude at the\nintegrator output, with no effect on the measured quantities, e.g. \u03c3c. The single error\nbar shown in fig. 2 for these data, represents a systematic error related to the accuracy\nof the simulator. \u201cDetuning\u201d the simulator to reduce the accuracy to ' \u00b16% compared\nto eq. (7) resulted in an upward or downward shift of the entire data set of magnitude\ncomparable to the error bar shown. Thus the Stratonovich phase line is nicely bracketed\nby our data.\nWe conclude that the Ito prescription for integrating the stochastic differential equa-\ntion is mathematically correct in the sense that an algorithm which imitates it produces\nresults in approximate agreement with the Ito calculations. The Stratonovich results,\nhowever, accurately describe what actually happens in nature.\nWe are grateful to Werner Horsthemke of the University of Texas at Austin for several\nstimulating discussions.\n5\nReferences\nl.

The circuit\nwas designed with a scale factor of unity, so that\nX(t) in volts is numerically comparable to the re-\nsults of eqs.

T\nhe fre-\nquency that X(t) visited the region between X a\nnd\nX + ~X was then computed for 0\";;; X < I. The first\ntime series was erased and a second obtaine\nd with the\nsecond frequency being added to the first.\nThis pro-\ncess was repeated, typically 2048 times, w\nhence the\naverage frequency -+Ps(X). Examples are s\nhown in\nfig. 4 by the continuous curves compared\nto the cal-\nculated results (solid circles) from eq.

Fig. 4\nb\nshows examples for 0< 0c' and 0> 0c' w\nhere the\ncalculated results are always Stratonovich.\nFor each\nvalue of A, we were able to find a \"'\" 0c by\nsearching\nfor a density with a single region of approx\nimately\nzero slope which separated the single peak\nset from\nthe double peak set. The results are shown\nin fig. 2\nby the open circles, and are in excellent ag\nreement\nwith the Stratonovich phase diagram.\nWe found that these results were independe\nnt of\nthe correlation time of the noise, so long a\ns this was\nkept smaller than about 3 ms. (Most of the\ndata were\nobtained with the noise generator band lim\nited to an\nupper cutoff frequency of 300 Hz, though\nwe tested\nthe results for cutoffs as low as 60 Hz and\nas high as\n1500 Hz.) This 'result indicates that the dy\nnamical\nsystem sees the noise as approximately wh\nite. In ad-\ndition, changing the time constant of the f\nast inte-\ngrator only caused a change in the noise am\nplitude\nat the integrator output, with no effect on\nthe mea-\nsured quantities, e.g. 0c' The single error b\nar shown\nin fig. 2 for these data, represents a system\natic error\nrelated to the accuracy of the simulator. \"D\netuning\"\nthe simulator to reduce the accuracy to ~\u00b1\n6% com-\npared to eq. (7) resulted in an upward or d\nownward\nshift of the entire data set of magnitude co\nmparable\nto the error bar shown. Thus the Stratonovi\nch phase\nline is nicely bracketed by our data.\nWe conclude that the Ito prescription for i\nntegrat-\ning the stochastic differential equation is m\nathemati-\ncally correct in the sense that an algorithm\nwhich imi-\ntates it produces results in approximate ag\nreement\nwith the Ito calculations. The Stratonovich\nresults,\nhowever, accurately describe what actually\nhappens\nin nature.\nWe are grateful to Werner Horsthemke of t\nhe Uni\u00b7\nversity of Texas at Austin for several stimu\nlating dis-\ncussions.\n[lJ N.C. van Kampen, J.
