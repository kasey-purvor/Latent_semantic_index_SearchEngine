Orbital resonances cause the disc to become eccentric, allowing material to\nfall back onto the donor star or out of the system.

This occurs when an element\nof the disc orbits with a frequency which is resonant with\nthat of the binary orbit, typically at a ratio of three to one.\nThis 3:1 resonance drives the accretion disc to become eccen-\ntric and causes the superhump modulations which are the\ndefining feature of the superoutbursts of cataclysmic vari-\nables. Disc resonances provide a second source of angular\nmomentum transport which is responsible for increasing the\nmass transfer rate, driving ordinary outbursts to become\nsuperoutbursts (Osaki 1989; Truss, Murray & Wynn 2001).\nIn known systems, superhumps normally fade soon af-\nter outburst. This is because the tidal torques clear material\nfrom the outer disc until there is no material remaining at\nthe resonant radius. Resonant effects cannot switch on again\nuntil a new outburst drives the outer disc beyond the reso-\nnant radius once more.\nIn this paper we consider the possibility that access\nto orbital resonances can be maintained almost indefinitely\nby the action of a weak magnetic propeller. It is known\nthat rapidly spinning and highly magnetic primary stars\ncan act as magnetic propellers in some cataclysmic vari-\n\u22c6 E-mail: owen.matthews@psi.ch\nables. Indeed, in the case of AE Aqr it is believed that\nthe entire mass transfer stream is ejected by a particularly\nstrong magnetic propeller (Wynn, King & Horne 1997) and\nthe evolution of AE Aqr (Schenker, Wynn & Speith 2004)\nand WZ Sge (Lasota, Kuulkers & Charles 1999) may well\nhave been influenced by magnetic effects. Here we consider\nthe possibility that a much weaker magnetic propeller might\ndrive the disc outwards as far as the resonant radius, and\nso maintain a reservoir of material at this radius. The re-\nsulting continuous deposition of angular momentum by the\nresonance would drive the growth of eccentric modes. Disc\nmaterial would be therefore be likely to extend beyond the\nprimary Roche lobe. Such material would then either es-\ncape the binary or fall back to the donor star, preventing\naccretion onto the primary star in either case.\nWe are motivated to study this mechanism because it\nmay modify the evolution of cataclysmic variables, especially\nif this state can be long lived. This may well be the case,\nsince a much weaker torque is required than in the AE Aqr\ncase. The mechanism may slow or even halt accretion onto\nthe white dwarf by driving mass out of the primary Roche\nlobe. At smaller mass ratios the resonant radii move further\ninto the Roche lobe of the primary star, and are more likely\nto reach the disc, so that any effect is likely to influence\nshort period cataclysmic variables disproportionately. This\nis interesting because existing models are unsuccessful in\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS\n2 O.M. Matthews et al.\nreproducing the observed evolutionary behaviour of short\nperiod cataclysmic variables.\nBinary evolution models predict a minimum orbital pe-\nriod for cataclysmic variables which is reached when the\ndonor star is no longer able to shrink in response to mass\nloss. Models consistently place this minimum at around\n65min (Kolb & Ritter 1992; Howell, Rappaport & Politano\n1997; Kolb & Baraffe 1999, e.g.), whereas the observed pe-\nriod distribution shows a sharp cut off at 78min (e.g.\nRitter & Kolb 1998; Tappert, Augusteijn & Maza 2002).\nThe same models also predict that the evolution of the or-\nbital period should slow at short periods, leading to an accu-\nmulation of systems in a sharp period spike at the minimum\nperiod. This feature is absent from the observed distribu-\ntion, as shown in Fig. 1.\nA number of explanations have been proposed for\nthese discrepancies, but none are entirely satisfactory. An\nobvious solution is to hide short period systems from\nview, but standard selection effects do not act suffi-\nciently strongly to explain the differences (Patterson 1998;\nKing, Schenker & Hameury 2002). Another possibility is\nthat an additional angular momentum loss mechanism could\nact to increase the minimum period (Patterson 1998) or a\nrange of angular momentum loss rates could blunt the period\nspike (King et al. 2002). However, Barker & Kolb (2002)\nshow that even the loss of all the angular momentum car-\nried by the accretion stream cannot increase the minimum\nperiod sufficiently. They also argue that blunting the period\nspike by \u2018smearing\u2019 the angular momentum loss rates would\nrequire a great deal of fine tuning to be successful.\nIn this paper we consider how the effects of propeller-\ninduced access to orbital resonances might prevent some\nshort-period CVs from exhibiting outburst behaviour, and\ncause them to become fainter. In Section 2 we discuss the\nmodel in more detail. In Sections 3 and 4 we explore the\nparameter space for which the idea may be of interest us-\ning smoothed particle hydrodynamics calculations. Finally,\nin Section 5, we discuss how this mechanism might influence\nthe evolution of short period cataclysmic variables.\n2 PROPELLER-DRIVEN RESONANT MASS\nLOSS\n2.1 Orbital Resonances\nIn this section we test the idea described in Section 1 by\nestablishing under which conditions the accretion disc has\naccess to the orbital resonances. These conditions are con-\nveniently described with reference to a series of important\nradii, measured from the primary star, all of which are plot-\nted in Fig. 2. Disc elements describe orbits that are approx-\nimately Keplerian, so that the positions of the orbital reso-\nnances are readily calculated from Kepler\u2019s law. Therefore,\nwhere a is the binary separation, the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances\nare found respectively at\nR2:1\na\n=\n(\n1\n2\n)2\/3\n(1 + q)\u22121\/3 , (1)\nR3:1\na\n=\n(\n1\n3\n)2\/3\n(1 + q)\u22121\/3 . (2)\nIf an accretion disc is to have access to a resonance then\nthe resonant radius must lie within the disc. If the disc ra-\nFigure 1.

(2002), but uses more recent data from then on-\nline version of Ritter & Kolb (1998). The plot contains data for\nall 215 CVs with periods known to be between 60 and 120 mins,\nfrom a total of 569 with known periods in the catalogue.\nFigure 2. Plot of resonant, Roche lobe, circularisation, and vis-\ncous disc radii about the primary star in a close binary as a func-\ntion of mass ratio q.\ndius can be related to the mass ratio then this consideration\ncan be used to calculate qmax, the maximum mass ratio for\nwhich resonant access is possible. There are several ways of\nestimating the extent of the disc. Firstly we use the Roche\nlobe radius. The Roche lobe of the accreting star provides\na hard maximum for the disc radius. The disc is, in fact\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe fate of short period cataclysmic variables 3\nFigure 3. This figure illustrates the positions of the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances in binaries with mass ratios of q = 0.05 in panel a, and\nq = 0.5 in panel b. The primary Roche lobe is marked with a solid line while the secondary star, which is assumed to be Roche lobe\nfilling, is coloured grey. The two dashed circles represent the resonant radii, the inner circle representing the 3:1 resonance and the outer\nline being the 2:1 resonance. The length unit is the binary separation a and the diagram is centred on the centre of mass. The primary\nstar is represented by a cross. In case a, both the resonant radii are within the Roche lobe and accessible to the disc, whereas neither is\navailable in case b.\nunlikely to extend this far in quiescence, but this provides\na good estimate for the radius in outburst, when the disc\nis subject to increased viscous spreading. The Roche lobe\nradius is approximated by Eggleton (1983) to be\nRL\na\n=\n0.49q\u22122\/3\n0.6q\u22122\/3 + ln (1 + q\u22121\/3)\n, (3)\nwhere q represents the mass ratio of the binary, q =M2\/M1.\nEquation 3 shows that the primary Roche lobe contracts\nwith increasing q, as must the maximum extent of the ac-\ncretion disc. Equating the 3:1 resonant radius and the Roch\nlobe radius, using equations (1) and (3), and solving for q\ngives a maximum mass ratio for access to the 2:1 resonance\nthus\nqmax,2:1 = 0.06 , (4)\nThe same technique when applied to the 3:1 resonance gives\na maximum access ratio of qmax,3:1 = 0.90. Paczyn\u00b4ski (1977)\ncomputed qmax,3:1 by solving the restricted three-body prob-\nlem, finding that\nqmax,3:1 = 0.25 . (5)\nThis much smaller value for qmax, 3 : 1 reflects the fact that\nthe accretion disc is tidally truncated within the primary\nRoche lobe. These results are also seen graphically in Fig. 2\nas the intersections of the resonant radii and the Roche lobe\nradius. This approach therefore provides a good estimate of\nthe maximum mass ratio qmax for which resonance access is\npermitted in outburst. For reference, the positions of the 3:1\nand 2:1 resonances are also marked in Fig. 3 for two typical\nCV mass ratios.\nWe note that qmax,2:1 is precisely the mass ratio at-\ntributed to WZ Sge (Skidmore et al. 2002). Indeed an out-\nburst orbital hump (OOH), probably driven by this reso-\nnance, was observed by Patterson et al. (2002) before the\nonset of 3:1 superhumps during the 2001 outburst, sug-\ngesting that the disc can access this resonance during out-\nburst, as would be expected. SU UMa stars exhibit super-\nhumps due to the 3:1 resonance so one would expect them\nto obey condition (5). Indeed, of all the confirmed SU UMa\nin Ritter & Kolb (1998), only two have q > 0.25.\nA rough estimate of the quiescent disc radius is given by\nthe circularisation radius Rcric. This is the radius of a circu-\nlar orbit associated with a specific angular momentum iden-\ntical to that with which mass crosses the first Lagrangian\npoint. It is the radius at which a disc will begin to form,\nand so all discs must extend at least this far. The circular-\nisation radius may be used as an estimate for the extent of\na very cold disc and is given by (e.g. Frank, King & Raine\n2002)\nRcirc\na\n= (1 + q)\n(\nRL1\na\n)4\n. (6)\nHere, the position of RL1, the first Lagrangian point, may be\nfound numerically, or it may be fitted by various expressions.\nThe position of RL1 should not be confused with the RL, the\nmean Roche lobe radius as defined in equation (3). Kopal\n(1959) gives the following fit for RL1.\nRL1\na\n= 1\u2212 \u03c9 + 1\n3\n\u03c92 +\n1\n9\n\u03c93 , (7)\nwhere\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n4 O.M. Matthews et al.\n\u03c93 =\nq\n3 (1 + q)\n. (8)\nEquating the 3:1 resonant radius and the circularisation ra-\ndius using equations (2) and (6), and solving for q, gives\nqmax,3:1 = 0.01 as the maximum mass ratio for which the\n3:1 resonance is accessible, if the disc is limited by the cir-\ncularisation radius. Such a limit however implies that there\nis no outwards viscous spreading whatever. Even quiescent\naccretion discs are however subject to some viscous spread-\ning.\nAn improved estimate for the extent of the quiescent\naccretion disc is that proposed by Osaki & Meyer (2002).\nIn this approach conservation of angular momentum in a\nsteady-state viscous disc, neglecting external torques, is used\nto estimate the outer radius of an accretion disc thus\nRout =\n(\n7\n5\n)2\nRcirc , (9)\nfor a quiescent Shakura-Sunyaev disc. Combining this result\nwith equation (2), this approach gives an estimate of the\nmaximum mass ratio for 3:1 resonance access in the quies-\ncent disc of\nqmax,3:1 = 0.29 . (10)\nWe note however that access to the 2:1 resonance is still lim-\nited by the Roche lobe estimate given by equation 4 since the\nRoche lobe is smaller than the viscous limit in this regime,\nas shown in Fig. 2.\n2.2 The magnetic propeller\nSo far we have discussed access to orbital resonances for an\nunperturbed, quiescent disc. During outburst the disc will\nexpand outwards due to increased viscous angular momen-\ntum transport, hence the detection of superhumps in super-\noutbursts. Another way to aid access to the binary reso-\nnances is by the addition of an additional source of angular\nmomentum, such as a magnetic torque. A magnetic field on\nthe primary star can act either to drive disc matter inwards\nor outwards; it may behave either as a source or as a sink\nof angular momentum. It is useful here to examine a simpli-\nfied case where the primary magnetic field rotates as a rigid\nbody, rooted to the primary star and rotating with angular\nfrequency \u2126\u22c6. The magnetic or magnetospheric radius Rmag\nis the radius at which the magnetic time-scale is equal to\nthe viscous time-scale; in other words it is the largest radius\nat which magnetic torques are significant in the disc. The\nco-rotation radius Rco is the radius at which an element of\ndisc, in describing a Keplerian orbit about the primary star,\nshares the angular frequency of the star and the magnetic\nfield. At this co-rotation radius, analogous to that of a geo-\nstationary orbit, there is no drag force between the field and\nthe disc, since they have the same velocity. However Rco\nmarks the boundary between the magnetic accretion and\nmagnetic propeller regimes, as illustrated in Fig. 4.\nAt those radii where R < Rco the magnetic field rotates\nless rapidly than the orbiting disc, and so acts to brake it,\naiding accretion. If Rmag < Rco therefore, then the disc will\nbe be disrupted at Rmag by the effect of rapid magnetic\naccretion, causing the star to spin up, as is the case in an\nintermediate polar. However, if Rmag > Rco then then disc\nmaterial, spreading inwards, first encounters a significant\nFigure 5. Spin-down time-scale \u03c4 as a function of mass ratio q for\na typical CV.

Although magnetic accretion and the magnetic\npropeller both result in a \u2018hole\u2019 in the accretion disc, they\nare distinct mechanisms with different outcomes for the pri-\nmary spin and for the disc structure. Disc truncation by\nthe magnetic propeller is implicated in the long recurrence\ntime of WZ Sge, and in FU Ori young stars (Matthews et al.\n2004). AE Aqr is an extreme case of propeller truncation.\nIn outbursting CVs, such as dwarf novae, an outburst\ncycle exists and a steady state is never reached. A propeller\nmay reduce the disc mass sufficiently so that such an out-\nburst is never triggered and a steady state is reached. In\nthis steady state, the disc must lose mass at the same rate\nat which it is fed by the accretion stream. This can lead\nto only two possible steady-state solutions. The disc will\nspread viscously as mass is added and either the inner disc\nwill reach Rco and the system will become a magnetic ac-\ncretor, or the outer disc will extend beyond RL and mass\nwill be lost from the Roche lobe. In the latter case, that of\nthe true propeller, a strong magnetic field is required, since\nmass must be pushed to radii beyond RL, and a rapid spin\ndown is therefore suffered by the primary star. Such a state\ncannot therefore be long lived and such systems are there-\nfore likely to be rare, and will not be significant in the CV\nperiod distribution.\n2.3 Combined effect of resonances and propeller\nThe model proposed in this paper uses both magnetic and\nresonant torques to enable a weak magnetic propeller to\neject mass from the primary Roche lobe.

The difference between the two cases is explained fully in the text.\nquires the magnetic propeller to push mass only as far as\nthe 3:1 resonance. This implies a much weaker propeller,\nand hence a longer spin down time. Such a propeller state\nmay therefore exist for much longer than one which relies\non the magnetic torque alone. In this picture, disc elements\nthat are propelled to the resonant radius will be excited\ninto eccentric orbits, losing angular momentum. The newly\neccentric orbits may carry disc material outside the Roche\nlobe at apastron, where it will be ejected from the binary\nor re-accreted by the secondary star. Both the propeller and\nthe resonant torque are critical to this model.\nPropeller-driven resonant mass loss will occur if two\nconditions are satisfied. Firstly, the circularisation radius\nmust also lie close to the 3:1 resonance so that a weak mag-\nnetic torque can lift mass to the resonant radius. Secondly,\nthe 3:1 resonance should lie within, but ideally close to, the\nRoche lobe radius so that a small eccentricity is able to drive\nmass from the Roche lobe and cause mass loss.\nThe magnetic torque and hence the white dwarf spin-\ndown time-scale required to drive resonant access can be\nestimated by calculating the torque required to lift mass\nfrom the circularisation radius to the 3:1 resonant radius,\nassuming that such mass will then be lost to the Roche lobe\nas a result of resonant torques. In the steady state the rate at\nwhich mass is transferred from Rcirc to RL1 is identical to the\nbinary mass transfer rate M\u02d9 . This gives a magnetic torque,\nwhich in the absence of accretion or any other sources of\nangular momentum, is identical to the primary spin-down\ntorque, of\nJ\u02d9mag =\n\u221a\nGM1M\u02d9\n(\nR\n1\/2\n3:1 \u2212R1\/2circ\n)\n, (11)\nwhere G represents the constant of universal gravitation and\nM1 is the mass of the primary star. Equations (6) and (11)\nmay be combined to give\nJ\u02d9mag =\n\u221a\nGM1M\u02d9a\n(\n\u03b31\/2 \u2212 [1 + q]1\/2\n[\nRL1\na\n]2)\n, (12)\nwhere RL1 is obtained for example from equation (7) and\nwhere \u03b3 = 0.48 for the 3:1 resonance. The spin-down time-\nscale is given by\n\u03c4spin =\nJwd\nJ\u02d9mag\n=\n2piIwd\nPspinJ\u02d9mag\n(13)\nwhere Jwd is the spin angular momentum of the white dwarf,\nIwd \u223c M1R2wd is the moment of inertia, Rwd is the radius\nof the white dwarf and Pspin is the WD spin period. The\nspin-down time-scale is then takes the form\n\u03c4spin =\n2piR2wdM\n1\/2\n1\nPspinM\u02d9G1\/2\n(\nR\n1\/2\n3:1 \u2212R1\/2circ\n) . (14)\nThe spin-down time-scale is then a weak function of a and\nM1, but a strong function of q, rising asymptotically at\nR3:1 = Rcirc. For a CV with orbital period Porb = 80 min,\nprimary spin period Pspin = 30 s, Rwd = 1 \u00d7 109 cm, mass\ntransfer rate M\u02d9 = 3 \u00d7 10\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and primary mass\nM1 = 1.2M\u2299 (selected to mtach numerical simulations) the\nspin-down time-scale is roughly constant at \u03c4spin \u223c 1010 yr\nfor most q, but is much longer for q . 0.05. This is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 5 with an asymptote at q \u223c 0.02. For q . 0.02\nthe circularisation radius lies outside the 3:1 resonant radius\nso that only the inner disc would have access to the torque\nfrom this orbital resonance. This may explain the results\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n6 O.M. Matthews et al.\nof Simpson & Wood (1998) who find, in SPH simulations\nof non-magnetic systems, that an eccentric precessing disc\ndoes not form where q . 0.025. Simpson & Wood (1998)\nthemselves invoke the damping effect of the 2:1 resonance\nto explain this effect.\nFor comparison, in the case of a pure magnetic pro-\npeller, where resonant torques are not considered, mass must\nbe lifted by the magnetic torque all the way from the cir-\ncularisation radius to the Roche lobe surface. Applying the\nsame method as above this gives\nJ\u02d9mag =\n\u221a\nGM1M\u02d9\n(\nR\n1\/2\nL \u2212R1\/2circ\n)\n. (15)\nThe spin down time can be computed in the same way, and\nexhibits the same asymptotic behaviour. However, as shown\nin Fig. 5, the spin-down time exceeds 1 \u00d7 1010 yr for the\nnon-resonant case only for unphysical mass ratios where q <\n0.005.\nIn the standard picture of CV evolution, a large num-\nber of systems are expected to accumulate around the period\nminimum, with small mass ratios. The mechanism outlined\nabove effectively halts accretion onto the primary star for\na significant fraction of the CV lifetime. During this phase\noutbursts are prevented and the disc mass is greatly reduced,\nalso reducing the disc luminosity and making the system ef-\nfectively undetectable. This phase will be much longer lived\nfor low q CVs so that more short period CVs would be hid-\nden from view, providing a possible explanation for the ab-\nsence of the period spike.\n3 SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS\nCALCULATIONS\nThe smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is a\nLagrangian particle technique for the modelling of fluid dy-\nnamics. The fundamental principle of SPH is that fluid prop-\nerties such as pressure and density are carried by particles\nwhich represent elements of the fluid in question. The val-\nues of these properties may then, at any point in space,\nbe interpolated using a weighted mean of the values car-\nried by nearby particles. Conservation of angular momentum\nis inherent in the SPH technique, which makes it an ideal\nmethod for the modelling of accretion discs. A review of the\nSPH method in general can be found in Monaghan (1992)\nwhile the particular code used here is discussed by Murray\n(1996) and by Truss et al. (2000). The viscosity used in this\nwork is the linear element of the SPH viscosity described\nby Monaghan (1992). In the divergence free case, this vis-\ncosity can be shown to be equivalent to the Navier-Stokes\nshear viscosity and to the Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) alpha\ndisc viscosity (e.g. Pongracic 1988; Matthews 2004). In three\ndimensions this viscosity is given by\n\u03bd =\n1\n10\n\u03b6csH \u223c \u03b1csH , (16)\nwhere \u03b6 is the SPH linear viscosity parameter, \u03b1 is the\nShakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter, cs is the sound speed\nin the disc and H is the disc scale height. In this version of\nthe code the sound speed is fixed throughout the calculation.\nFull magnetohydrodynamics have not yet been success-\nfully incorporated into SPH though efforts have been made\nin this direction (e.g. Price & Monaghan 2005). A simple\napproach to modelling the effect of the primary magnetic\nfield is to apply a magnetic torque prescription to the SPH\nparticles. The magnetic element of the momentum equation\ncan be expressed as\nJ\u00d7B = 1\n\u00b5r\n(B \u00b7 \u2207)B\u2212\u2207\n(\nB2\n2\u00b5r\n)\n, (17)\nwhere J is current density, B is magnetic field and \u00b5r is the\npermeability of the plasma. The first term on the right hand\nside is in the form of a tension, which vanishes if the field\nlines are not curved, and the second represents a pressure\nwhich can usually be neglected for slowly varying fields.\nIf equation (17) is transformed into cylindrical polar\ncoordinates, and if it is assumed that the radial component\nof the magnetic field is small and that B2 \u223c BzB\u03d5, then the\nmagnetic acceleration takes the form (e.g. Matthews 2004)\namag \u223c 1\n\u03c1rc\n(\nBzB\u03d5\n4pi\n)\n, (18)\nwhere \u03c1 is density and rc represents the radius of curvature\nof the magnetic field lines, while Bz and B\u03d5 represent the\nvertical and azimuthal components of the magnetic field re-\nspectively. We make the further approximation that the ra-\ndius of curvature of the field lines is of the order of the disc\nscale-height so that rc \u223c H (e.g. Pearson, Wynn & King\n1997). The ratio of vertical to azimuthal field strengths is re-\nlated to the shear between the disc and the magnetic field. If\nit is assumed that the field rotates rigidly with the star then\nthis ratio can be expressed in the form (e.g. Livio & Pringle\n1992)\nB\u03d5\nBz\n\u223c \u2212 (\u2126k \u2212 \u2126\u22c6)\n\u2126k\n, (19)\nwhere \u2126k denotes the Keplerian angular velocity at radius\nR from the star. If Keplerian orbits are assumed, the surface\ndensity related to the disc scale height by \u03a3 \u223c \u03c1H , and the\nmagnetic moment is defined by the expression \u00b5 = BzR\n3,\nthen we may make the approximation\namag \u223c \u2212\u00b5\n2R\u22126\n4pi\u03a3\n(\u2126k \u2212 \u2126\u22c6)\n\u2126k\n\u223c \u2212\u00b5\n2R\u22126\n4pi\u03a3\n|vd \u2212 vB|\nvd\n, (20)\nwhere vd and vB are the velocities of the disc and the mag-\nnetic field respectively. It is an acceleration of this form\nwhich is added to the particles in the SPH model to rep-\nresent the effect of the primary magnetic field. The acceler-\nation is fixed in the code by the parameter\nkm =\n\u00b52\n4pi\u03a3\n. (21)\nThe effects of the binary resonance require no such effort to\nreproduce, but emerge naturally as a result of gravitational\nforces exerted on the particles by the binary. Every parti-\ncle is subject to a gravitational acceleration from each star\nin addition to the magnetic acceleration defined in equation\n(20) and fluid dynamic forces. In order to compute the pre-\ndicted spin evolution of the primary star, the torques due to\nmagnetic and gravitational accelerations are calculated and\nrecorded separately. However, at this stage the code per-\nmits neither the spin of the primary nor the orbital period\nto evolve as a result of the computed angular momentum\ntransfer.\nMass is injected at the first Lagrangian point and is\nremoved from the simulation in three ways. Particles which\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe fate of short period cataclysmic variables 7\nreach the surface of the white dwarf at R\u22c6 = 6\u00d7 108 cm are\nremoved and count towards accreted mass. If elements of\nthe disc extend beyond 1\u00d7 1010 cm then they removed and\ncounted as mass lost to the system. If mass re-enters the\nsecondary Roche lobe, then it is considered to have been\nre-accreted by the secondary star.\n4 NUMERICAL RESULTS\nA series of numerical experiments were performed to con-\nfirm the viability of the mechanism explained in Section 2\nand to briefly explore the parameter space for which that\nmechanism is operable. Certain basic parameters of the\nsystem were fixed: the total mass of the system was set\nto Mtot = 1.2 M\u2299, because the simulations were initially\npart of a programme to model WZ Sge. The orbital pe-\nriod was Porb = 80 min and the spin period of the pri-\nmary star was a deliberately short Pspin = 30 s. Particles\nwere injected into the primary Roche Lobe at a rate of\nM\u02d9 = 3.0 \u00d7 10\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 although in some cases little of\nthis mass found its way to the primary star. The Shakura-\nSunyaev alpha viscosity was fixed at \u03b1 = 0.01 throughout\nthe calculations. In all cases the computation began with an\nempty disc and was permitted to run until a steady state\nwas reached. In reality such systems would evolve, with full\ndiscs, from longer periods but the choice of an empty disc as\nan initial condition provides a clear illustration of the onset\nof resonant mass ejection and, since such simulations can\nbe performed rapidly, allows a greater number of computa-\ntions to be performed. The particle mass was varied between\nmodels to enable steady state to be achieved in those compu-\ntations which led to high mass discs, without causing lower\nmass discs to be under resolved.\nThe experiment was performed with mass ratios of 0.05,\n0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 and the magnetic parameter km was set\nto values which, for a primary star of radius R\u22c6 \u223c 1\u00d7109 cm\nand a disc surface density of \u03a3 \u223c 1 g cm\u22122, correspond to\nvery modest magnetic field strengths of Bz = 5 kG, 4 kG,\n2 kG and zero at the surface of the white dwarf. It should be\nnoted however that the relationship between the magnetic\nfield strength and the code parameter km is model depen-\ndent, so that results should be treated as no more than a\nguide to the real fields required to support this mechanism.\nThe results showed that both the steady-state disc mass\nand primary accretion rate were an order of magnitude lower\nin the magnetic cases than in the non-magnetic case; the disc\nmass fell from 10\u221213 to 10\u221213 of the binary mass while the\naccretion rate onto the primary fell from 0.9 to 0.1 of the\nmass transfer across the L1 point. Neither the magnetic field\nstrength amongst the magnetic cases, nor the mass ratio had\na clear effect on the steady-state disc mass or on the white\ndwarf accretion rate. However, these simulations were per-\nformed at mass ratios higher than those for which a strong\ndependence would be expected.\nAn example of resonant mass ejection, drawn from the\nrange of calculations described above, is illustrated in Fig. 6.\nDisc matter is prevented from accreting by the magnetic pro-\npeller and the disc spreads outwards. When the disc grows\nsufficiently to be able to access the 3:1 resonance, eccentric\nmodes are excited in the disc. The eccentricity grows until a\nproportion of the disc protrudes beyond the primary Roche\nFigure 7. This figure shows the variation of disc mass with time\nduring the onset of propeller-driven resonant mass ejection, be-\nginning from an empty disc. Results are taken from the same SPH\ncomputation as for Fig. 6. Extensive mass loss commences after\n40 binary orbits and a quasi-steady state is then reached. From\nthis time onwards a modulation appears, at a frequency close to\nthat of the binary orbit. Note the agreement between this result\nand that shown in fig. 5 of Hirose & Osaki (1990).\nlobe and can be swept up by the secondary star, or is lost to\nthe system. That this eccentricity is not the result of initial\nparticle velocities is clear from the fact that the disc passes\nthrough a circular phase and that the effect is absent in the\nnon-magnetic case.\nThe longer-term evolution of the disc in the same com-\nputation is illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8 where the disc mass\nand the torque exerted upon the disc are plotted against\ntime for around a hundred orbits. It is clear that once the\ndisc \u2018catches\u2019 the 3:1 resonance after about 40 orbits, disc\nmass is lost rapidly from the system until a quasi-steady\nstate is reached. This result is in good agreement with sim-\nulations performed by Hirose & Osaki (1990). Both the disc\nmass and the gravitational torque upon the disc exhibit a\nmodulation on roughly the orbital period, which emerges\nat the same time as the aforementioned dramatic mass loss\nepisode. This is easily understood by considering the sec-\nondary star sweeping up disc mass once per orbit from the\nprotruding part of the disc, and exerting a similarly modu-\nlated resonant torque. In fact, taking the precession of the\ndisc into account, the modulation of the disc mass would\nbe expected to occur on the beat frequency between the bi-\nnary orbit and the disc precession period: the superhump\nperiod. This indeed proves to be the case. No such mod-\nulation is observed in the magnetic torque which remains\nroughly constant with time after the quasi-steady state has\nbeen reached. This is as expected, because the magnetic field\nacts predominantly on the inner edge of the accretion disc.\nBy definition, the total angular momentum of the disc\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n8 O.M. Matthews et al.\nFigure 6. These plots, taken from an SPH computation, of log surface density in g cm\u22121 show how propeller-driven resonant mass\nejection might begin, starting from an empty disc. The simulation contained \u223c 30, 000 particles with a sound speed of cs \u223c 1\u00d7106 cm s\u22121.\nThe primary Roche lobe is marked with a solid line while the secondary star, which is assumed to be Roche lobe filling, is coloured\ngrey. The dashed circle represents the 3:1 resonant radius. The length unit is the binary separation a and the diagram is centred on the\ncentre of mass. The binary is orbiting in the anticlockwise (direct) sense. The primary star is represented by a cross. This simulation\nwas performed with a mass ratio of q = 0.05, a primary mass of M1 = 1.2 M\u2299, a binary period of Porb = 80 min, a primary spin period\nof Pspin = 30 s, a mass transfer rate in the accretion stream of M\u02d9 = 3.0 \u00d7 10\n\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 and a surface magnetic field of 5 kG. In\nframe a, after a single orbit, the disc is just beginning to fill and the initial rosette structure is still visible. In frame b, after 15 orbits,\nthe disc has become circularised as a result of viscous processes. However, in frame c, after 25 orbits, the resonance is beginning to drive\nan eccentricity, and by frame d, after only 50 orbits, that eccentricity is sufficient to cause extensive mass loss, with a large amount of\nmass being swept up by the secondary star.\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\nThe fate of short period cataclysmic variables 9\nFigure 8. This figure shows the change of angular momentum\ndue to magnetic and gravitational torques during the onset of\npropeller-driven resonant mass ejection, beginning from an empty\ndisc. Results are taken from the same computation as for Figs. 6\nand 7. The effect on disc angular momentum due to mass flux is\nnot illustrated.\ndoes not exhibit long term variation after the quasi-steady\nstate has been reached. The gravitational torque acts to\ncounteract that applied by the primary magnetic field. The\ndisc is spun up by the magnetic field and spun down again\nby the binary, so that a weak spin couple exists between\nthe binary orbit and the primary spin. This drives a long\nterm tendency towards a synchronous lock, but on a time-\nscale so long as to be largely irrelevant. Fig. 8 shows a small\nnet torque acting to spin down the disc. However, the plot\nshows only applied torques and does not include the flux of\nangular momentum carried by particles entering and leaving\nthe computation, which counteracts this trend, and allows\na quasi-steady state to be maintained.\nAn approximate spin-down time-scale for the primary\nstar can be calculated from equation (13) where J\u02d9mag is cal-\nculated here from numerical results, disregarding accretion\ntorques. A value may be taken from Fig. 8 for example. In\nall cases where accretion was prevented in the above com-\nputations, spin-down times are found to be of the order\ntspin \u223c 1010 yr in good agreement with analytic treatment\nin the previous section for q . 0.05. Numerical simulations\nhave not yet been performed for very small q values, but\nanalytic results show that the spin-down time-scale would\nbe much longer.\n5 EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES\nIt has been shown that accretion, and hence luminosity, may\nbe greatly reduced in CVs by a weak propeller acting to-\ngether with orbital resonances. In this mechanism the mag-\nnetic field of the rapidly spinning primary drives matter to\nthe 3:1 orbital resonance. The action of this resonance then\nexcites eccentric modes in the disc material. Disc mass is\nthen lost from the primary Roche lobe and some may be re-\naccreted by the donor star. A CV may exist in this state for\na significant fraction of its lifetime. Importantly, this non-\naccreting state can last much longer in systems close to the\nperiod minimum, so that a larger proportion of short period\nCVs would be expected to exist in this invisible state. This\nmechanism of propeller-driven resonant mass ejection may\ntherefore go some way towards explaining the absence of the\npredicted excess of short period CVs; the period spike.\nIn this picture, CVs evolving towards shorter periods\nwill enter the non-accreting weak propeller state at vari-\nous mass ratios, depending on the spin and magnetic field\nof the accreting white dwarf. This state is reached as soon\nas the 3:1 orbital radius becomes accessible to magnetically\ntorqued disc matter. This phase will continue until the white\ndwarf has spun down sufficiently that accretion can resume,\nwhich occurs on a time-scale of \u03c4spin \u223c 1010 yr for most mass\nratios but which increases greatly at very small q. Because\nthe non-accreting state is longer lived in short period sys-\ntems we would expect this mechanism for hiding the period\nspike to be more efficient for those CVs entering this weak-\npropeller state later in their binary evolution, i.e. those with\nweaker primary magnetic fields. If propeller-driven resonant\nmass ejection does occur in CVs then it will greatly reduce\nthe luminosity due to the accretion disc and to accretion\nonto the white dwarf. A population of low-luminosity CV-\nlike objects with low luminosity is therefore predicted by this\nmodel, for which there are currently no known candidates.\nHowever, since in addition to a greatly reduced luminosity,\noutbursts would also be prevented in such systems, the non-\ndetection of these objects may be due to selection effects.\nIf such stars were detected however, then they would be\nexpected to exhibit permanent superhumps, since the disc\nwould always be eccentric and precessing. It may also be pos-\nsible to observe the re-accretion of matter by the secondary\nstar in these objects.\nIn normal CV evolution, mass transfer from the sec-\nondary to the primary star, driven by an angular momen-\ntum loss mechanism such as gravitational radiation, reduces\nthe mass ratio with time. In the weak propeller mechanism\nproposed here, most mass is not accreted by the primary\nstar, but instead is re-accreted by the secondary so that the\nmass ratio does not evolve. For the secondary Roche lobe to\naccept this mass, either the contraction of the Roche lobe\nmust be slowed or the secondary star itself must be made to\ncontract more rapidly. The weak propeller mechanism lends\nitself to both of these possibilities. Matter is returned to the\nsecondary with increased angular momentum, drawn from\nthe primary star, which will slow the contraction of the sec-\nondary Roche lobe. Also, the matter comes from a cool disc,\nso it is likely to come with a reduced specific entropy, en-\ncouraging the secondary star to contract. Because of this\nlatter effect, and because some mass may be lost to the sys-\ntem rather than re-accreted by the secondary, the period of\nthe CV may shorten, following the Roche lobe relation\nPorb \u221d\n(\nR32\nM2\n)1\/2\n, (22)\nc\u00a9 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n10 O.M. Matthews et al.\nwhere R2 is the radius of the secondary star. However the\nevolution in Porb should be slowed as compared to the stan-\ndard picture. Binaries are therefore expected to spend longer\nat short periods than would otherwise be expected in the\nweak propeller case.\nIt would be useful to perform more extensive param-\neter space explorations and to compare the importance of\nmagnetic and accretion torques in different configurations.\nA full population synthesis including binary evolution could\nthen be used to asses the precise effect of this weak propeller\nmodel on the CV period distribution. To achieve the most\nrealistic results, an improved model for the magnetic field\nwould also be desirable.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMRT acknowledges a PPARC postdoctoral fellowship held\nat the University of St Andrew between 2002 and 2005.
