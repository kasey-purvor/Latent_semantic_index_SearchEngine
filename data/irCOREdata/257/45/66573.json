However, transforming \nracially skewed ownership and skill patterns is proving a particular challenge. This paper \noutlines some of the initiatives that have been introduced to stimulate socio-economic \nchange within the industry. By utilising analytical tools such as commodity chains, \nnetworks and cultural approaches we demonstrate that a complex array of forces is \ndriving change on the ground. Such forces include national imperatives derived from the \nlegacy of apartheid and the concerns of consumers in the global north. The paper \nconcludes by considering the types of local and global constraints that need to be \nchallenged if these initiatives are to be successful in facilitating meaningful socio-\neconomic transformation within the wine industry. \n \nIntroduction \nIn an era of neo-liberal globalisation developing nations have been encouraged, some \nwould say coerced, to liberalise their economies and engage with international trade \nflows in order to promote socio-economic development. Critics point out that the \n\u2015rigged rules and double standards\u2016 (maketradefair.com 2004) that typify the \n 3 \ninternational trade regime militate against developing nations and ensure that the \nhegemony of advanced industrial countries is maintained. However, proponents of \noutward orientation emphasise that benefits are to be gained through identifying \nprofitable niches in global trade markets, suggesting that more equitable forms of \neconomic transformation can occur if a putative \u2017high road\u2018, characterised by higher \nskill and wage levels, to economic growth and development is followed (Simon 2001). \nAlternative approaches to trade are one facet of these new opportunities that, it is \nclaimed, can harness the forces of globalisation in the interests of the poor. A major \narena of contemporary debates concerns the possibilities offered by \u2017ethical\u2018 and \u2017fair\u2018 \ntrade. (Ethical trade refers to a sourcing project that concentrates on conditions of labour \nwithin the place of work; unlike fair trade it does not explicitly challenge unjust power \nrelations in trade between rich and poor countries.) Supporters believe that such \napproaches can facilitate \u2017globalisation from below\u2018 and stimulate more equitable forms \nof development; critics are concerned that they merely represent novel means for global \ncorporations to exploit niches in global markets, driven by consumption in affluent \neconomies and delivering very little in real terms to poorer countries. \nIn this paper, we engage these debates through a case study of ethical trade in the \nSouth African wine industry. Despite being largely ignored in academic studies of \nfair\/ethical trade outside South Africa, where the material cultures of chocolate, tea, \ncoffee and bananas have tended to dominate (e.g. Barratt-Brown 1993; Renard 1999; \nSmith 2002; Tallontire 2000), the South African wine industry has played a significant \nrole in international ethical trade initiatives. It is also a highly capitalised sector of the \neconomy, in contrast to smallholder production that has tended to dominate debates, and \n 4 \nis of particular significance to the challenges facing post-apartheid governments. On the \none hand, there is a political and moral imperative to dismantle the racially delineated \nsocio-economic disparities that rank the nation amongst the most unequal in the world \n(Adedeji 1993; Binns 1998). On the other hand, the inward-looking nature of the \napartheid economy, reinforced by decades of sanctions and boycotts, left a legacy of \noutmoded production and trade structures. Thus, within a context of globalisation there \nhas been a need to decisively re-constitute the nation\u2018s links with the international \neconomy in order to stimulate economic growth and employment. In 1996, the \ngovernment introduced its Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) macro-\neconomic programme; heavily influenced by the form of neo-liberalism hegemonic \nwithin the international financial institutions at that time, GEAR aimed to challenge the \nanti-export bias that had long been embedded within national trade policy (Cassim and \nOnyango 2001). Thus, a tight fiscal stance was adopted, exchange controls were relaxed \nand tariff programmes rationalised, with the principal aim of creating an environment to \nattract inward investment and stimulate exports (Bond 2000). Despite this disciplined \nadherence to neo-liberal orthodoxy, however, gaining a significant foothold within the \nhighly competitive and asymmetric global economy has proven difficult. Land-based \nproduction activities in particular have struggled to compete within a more open trade \nregime (Marais 2001).  \nGiven the dual politico-moral and economic imperatives driving restructuring in \nSouth Africa, debates about the role of globalisation and alternative forms of trade in \ntransforming the lives of the poor are of particular concern here. This paper examines \nthese issues by exploring ongoing efforts by actors within South Africa\u2018s wine industry \n 5 \nto exploit ethical niches within international markets. The industry has the potential to \nenjoy a strong competitive advantage on the global stage and producers and wholesalers \nare transforming business structures to meet the demands of international markets. An \narray of processes have been operating simultaneously that seek to effect transformation \nof a very different kind; that is in terms of radically improving \u2017black\u2018 people\u2018s access to \nopportunities within the industry (we use the term \u2017black\u2018 as inclusive of all people of \ncolour, whilst being mindful of the sensitivities associated with such terminology). We \nexamine the complex forces driving these latter initiatives. Under apartheid the wine \nindustry was not only exclusively white-owned but also infamous for the appalling \ntreatment endured by its black workforce. We demonstrate how efforts to effect these \ntwo transformations are in some cases becoming intertwined, with evidence suggesting \nthat localised endeavours driving socio-economic transformation are connecting with \nbroader international moves towards ethical trade. We explore how improving working \nconditions and re-dressing patterns of racially defined privilege creates possibilities for \nindividual producers, and the industry as a whole, to embark on an export-oriented \u2017high \nroad\u2018, connecting with northern consumers\u2018 demands for \u2017ethical\u2018 produce. In this sense \nthese South African-based \u2017empowerment\u2018 initiatives are particularly interesting as they \nseek explicitly to effect transformation through engagement with global forces, which \nare more usually associated with the generation of socio-economic disparities. \nThe primary focus of the paper is to elucidate elements of ongoing socio-\neconomic transformation within the South African wine industry, particularly those \nelements that seek to engage with northern consumers through the promotion of \nexplicitly ethical production practices. Analytical tools drawn from contemporary \n 6 \ntheorisations of globalised systems of production and consumption are deployed in order \nto shed light upon the complex processes emerging within the industry. These \napproaches illustrate the apparently constructive role played by UK-based consumers \nand retailers (the UK is by far the biggest market for South African wines) in facilitating \nagents of progressive change within the Winelands region of the Western Cape. We seek \nto highlight the ways in which momentum for transformation is gathering pace, but also \nthe constraints that exist in the form of local elite resistance and the business practices of \nUK-based retail corporations. Our assessments are based on research conducted in the \nWestern Cape in March\/April 2004. A wide range of informants involved in the South \nAfrican wine industry were interviewed including producers, managers, government \nofficials, consultants, representatives of labour unions, employment associations, \nmarketing associations and empowerment-focused wine industry bodies. Due to the \npolitically and commercially sensitive nature of much of the information the identity of \nall sources is protected. 210 postal questionnaires were also sent to former members of \nthe Anti-Apartheid Movement in the UK (facilitated by Action for Southern Africa \n(ACTSA) with a 55% response). The survey explored people\u2018s knowledge of and \nattitudes to alternative trade products emanating from South Africa.  \nWe begin by exploring the utility of concepts such as commodity chains, \nnetworks and cultural approaches in bringing meaning to ongoing changes in the wine \ngrowing regions of South Africa. A contextual account of the South African wine \nindustry provides a backdrop for understanding how and why efforts to transform the \nindustry have evolved in the last decade and the importance of UK-based consumers and \nretailers in facilitating the emergence of new transformative initiatives. Two aspects of \n 7 \nthe ongoing transformation process are examined in detail: grassroots worker-focused \nschemes on individual estates and industry-wide initiatives, such as the Wine Industry \nEthical Trade Association (WIETA). The actual and potential contribution of such \ninitiatives to meaningful socio-economic change is examined as we consider the extent \nto which they represent a progressive path to socio-economic transformation. We \nconclude by outlining some of the multi-scalar struggles that lie ahead if a meaningful \ntransformation is to be effected in the South African wine industry.  \nConceptualising transformations in the wine industry \nThe mechanics of global agri-business have been the subject of much theoretical \nconsideration in recent years. The global commodity chain (GCC) approach has been \nperceived as an accepted point of entry for analysing the relationships between global \ncore and (semi) peripheral regions in the production and consumption of commodities \n(Gereffi 1994a; Gereffi 1994b). Such an approach enables the distribution of power \nwithin international commodity chains to be considered (Goodman and Watts 1997) and \ncan illuminate the origins of the exploitative practices that impinge upon the \ndevelopment of producers in peripheral regions (Gywnne 2003). Whilst the GCC \napproach is widely perceived to have many strengths it is also constrained by its lack of \nconceptual sophistication. It tends to privilege processes at the site of production, thus \nlosing sight of the impacts of consumption practices (Cook et al. 1996; Leslie and \nReimer 1999). The perceived linearity of the connections between different actors in the \nchain is also a significant shortcoming. Instead the interactions between different actors \nmay best be understood through the deployment of a network metaphor, with flows of \n 8 \ninformation, which undergo constant mediation and re-interpretation, occurring in \nvarious directions between actors within a network (Bebbington 2003).  \nA strength of a network-based approach is that it facilitates explanations for the \ncompetitive pressures experienced at the site of production by tracing the \u2015multi-\nstranded connections between a variety of significant and interrelated actors\u2016 instead of \nthe \u2015uni-directional, causal mechanisms suggested by GCC\u2016 (Hughes 2000: 177). This \nallows for a more meaningful investigation of the complexity and opacity of global \nsystems agro-food production and consumption. Interestingly, actors within the wine \nindustry invariably conceptualise their business as part of a linear \u2017value chain\u2018, which \nworks to the advantage of certain actors, especially retailers whose interests are best \nserved by maintaining such simplistic conceptualisations. Network-based approaches \nassist in bringing greater understanding to the realities of daily business practice within \nthe industry. The ensuing analysis illustrates how a complex network of actors \n(including inter alia, government, TNCs, northern consumers, international regulatory \ninstitutions, industry bodies, farmers and workers) interact to facilitate and\/or constrain \nsocio-economic development within the South African wine industry.   \n Such understandings can be supplemented through reference to cultural \nprocesses. It has increasingly been recognised that the processes of commodity \nproduction, distribution and consumption are continually subject to culturally based \ninterpretations (Cook et al. 1996; Jackson 1999). A critical contribution of this approach \nhas been to bring the realm of consumption to the forefront of analysis; thus: \nrather than prioritising realities at the site of production, and simply \nsearching for causal mechanisms responsible for these realities\u2026work on \n 9 \ncommodity cultures aims to thicken descriptions of the meanings \nattached to goods through a cultural analysis of different phases of \ncommodity circulation, including consumption. (Hughes 2000: 179) \nWe argue that consumption practices within UK markets are having important impacts \nupon on-farm labour practices within South Africa. These processes are highly complex \nand are heavily mediated by various industry actors. Through a close examination of this \nwe are able to gain a greater understanding of the distribution of power within this \nparticular network and thus to consider the potential for progressive change within the \nSouth African wine industry. We use this example to demonstrate the significance of \nmulti-scalar struggles in the challenges facing ethical trade and how these, though \nlocalized \u2015works in progress\u2016 (Allen et al. 2003: 62), are also connected to struggles \nagainst the most pernicious effects of global capitalism. \nThe challenges of transformation in the Winelands \nThe structure and organisation of the South African wine industry has undergone a \nsubstantial transformation since the end of apartheid and the dismantling of the \nregulatory regime that shaped the industry\u2018s activities throughout the twentieth century \n(Ewert 2002). Prior to 1994, production was aimed primarily at the domestic market \nwith the majority of grapes being sold by producers and their cooperatives to the KWV \n(Co-operative Wine Growers of South Africa) and other wholesalers (Williamson and \nWood 2003). Guaranteed prices protected producers from market variations, creating a \ndistorted market that favoured mass production of low quality grapes and doing little to \nreflect the unique terroir of the Western Cape. Innovation was effectively stifled as \n 10 \nproducers had no real incentive to upgrade technology or skills. International boycotts \nand sanctions exacerbated these inward-looking characteristics of the industry.   \nBy the time sanctions were lifted in the early 1990s, the industry was poorly \nprepared to exploit newly available opportunities. Whilst overseas consumers were keen \nto support South Africa\u2018s exports for the first time in decades, a rapidly earned \nreputation for \u2017mixed\u2018 quality wine stymied medium-term efforts to promote export \ngrowth. However, by the end of the first decade of democracy the picture is very \ndifferent. New entrepreneurs have travelled the world to acquire knowledge of the latest \ntechnologies and marketing concepts and have operationalised these in South Africa. \nWhilst the learning curve has been steep, sufficient progress has been made both by \nindividual estates and within industry institutions to facilitate an increase in exports from \n20 to 220 million litres between 1994 and 2004 (Beake 2004). By 2003 South Africa had \nbecome the fifth largest exporter by value into the all-important UK wine market, was \nachieving year on year growth of 12% (second only to Australia) and three South \nAfrican brands (Kumala, Arniston Bay and Namaqua) occupied positions in the top \ntwenty best-sellers list (AC Neilsen 2004). In this sense the wine industry is one success \nstory of the government\u2018s export-oriented trade regime, but what of transformations in \nworking conditions?  \n The inward-looking and uncompetitive business model underpinning the \napartheid-era industry was able to survive due to the appalling employment \nenvironments endured by workers, described as the \u2015worst working conditions \nexperienced in South Africa\u2016 (Brown et al. 2003: 23). A concept of paternalism defined \nthe relationship between farmer and workers, with the latter receiving \u2017social dividends\u2018 \n 11 \n(housing, electricity and water) in addition to wages. However, wage levels were \nextremely low and whilst housing was usually available to permanent employees, this \nwas lost if workers were fired (du Toit 1993). Workers were barred from collective \norganisation and faced punishments if efforts were made to unionise or engage in \ncollective bargaining. Perhaps the most infamous aspect of on-farm labour relations was \nthe \u2017dop\u2018 system, whereby workers were paid a component of their wages in the form of \nlow-grade wine (Brown et al. 2003).  As one commentator writes: \nGenerations of workers lived and died in shoddy housing, earning very little and \nslowly drinking themselves to death on \u2017dops\u2018 of cheap wine supplied by the \nfarmers in lieu of cash. All that is changing, but not fast enough. (Anon 2004) \nThe resultant alcoholism increased dependence on employers and became associated \nwith a raft of social problems in worker communities, including domestic violence and \nfoetal alcohol syndrome. \n  As international sanctions were tightened in the 1980s, efforts were made to \nimprove social conditions on farms (Ewert and Hamman 1999). These were initiated \nfrom within the industry with the support of the apartheid government and conservative \ninternational donors, rather than through worker activism, and were motivated by a need \nto improve productivity and upgrade externally held perceptions of the industry. Some \nsignificant improvements were made in terms of provision of schooling for workers\u2018 \nchildren and reduced infant mortality and fertility rates (Groenewald 1993). Recent \nresearch, however, reveals that the legacy of apartheid-era working conditions still \naffects labour within the industry. Pay rates tend to be very low, whilst working hours \nfrequently exceed those laid down as acceptable by government legislation (Brown et al. \n 12 \n2003; Ewert and du Toit 2004; Women on Farms Project 2003). Physical abuse of \nworkers is still evident on some farms and child labour is not uncommon, especially \nduring seasonal peaks of labour demand. Health and safety is frequently a concern, \nparticularly in relation to exposure to agrochemicals. The dop system is still practised on \na few estates (Brown et al. 2003). In order to reduce labour costs, many employers are \nnow seeking an increased proportion of contracted off-farm labour. Non-permanent \nworkers are excluded from many basic entitlements and report much higher levels of \nexploitation and abuse. Such radical shifts in the structure of the division of labour have \nhad profound implications for the broader relationship between workers and employees. \nThus, farmers are abandoning many of the \u2017social dividends\u2018 of the paternalist system. \nAs many as a third of farmers, for example, no longer consider the provision of housing \nto be part of their contract with employees (Ewert and du Toit 2004).  \n The ANC government has been extremely active in setting a legislative \nframework that seeks to redress the balance between employers and employees in the \npost-apartheid era. A series of employment acts, in theory at least, provide South \nAfrican employees with a high level of support and protection (Ethical Trading Initiative \n2004; Kruger and Hamman 2004). Whilst employment legislation seeks to address class-\nbased imbalances, Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) legislation has sought to \ntackle the racially delineated inequalities inherited from the previous regime. These two \nfacets of legal change define the legislative parameters within which the wine industry \noperates but enormous obstacles to transformation persist. A formidable \u2017wine industry \ncomplex\u2018 has evolved dominated by white Afrikaner men, many of whom were leading \nsupporters of the National Party under apartheid. To a large extent, this white elite \n 13 \ncontinues to run the industry\u2018s major businesses and institutions (Ewert and du Toit \n2004). It is thus hardly surprising that processes of black empowerment and broader \nsocietal transformation are often interpreted rather conservatively. Indeed, according to \nsome industry observers, progressive change in the last decade has been largely limited \nto providing jobs for white women, who had been previously excluded from professional \nor managerial positions. The ongoing exploitation of black farm workers is but one \ndimension of the considerable and racially delineated challenges confronting the \ntransformation process. Land ownership continues to remain almost exclusively in the \nhands of the minority white population (Kruger 2004; Kruger and Hamman 2004; Vink \n2004). A handful of wineries are moving into black ownership but the rate of change is \nsuch that less than 1% of the industry is under black ownership (Nxumalo 2003). \nEmployment patterns are highly racialised with few opportunities for black people \nwithin more highly remunerated positions. At the time of research, ten years after the \nelection of the ANC, only one black person had reached the level of chief executive \nwithin any wine-producing organisation.  \nEvidence suggests that pragmatists within the industry approach empowerment \nand its associated support structure of legislation and initiatives as a set of challenges to \nbe cynically manipulated. As one government figure observed, \u2015The lawyers are usually \nat work identifying loopholes before the ink is dry on new legislation\u2016 (01\/04\/04). \nEnforcing legislation regarding on-farm labour practices is proving difficult; the \nDepartment of Labour is desperately under-resourced and inspectors face many \nobstacles when organising farm visits. Thus, the pace of socio-economic change within \nthe industry has been rather slow. Critics point out that the industry has been highly \n 14 \neffective in talking the language of transformation and in setting up high profile \ninitiatives but progressive outcomes remain limited. A senior figure in marketing \nsuggested, with more than a hint of irony, that we should, \u2015just ask VineCape [a \npseudonym for a major Winelands-based company] how many black people are \nemployed in their marketing department!\u2016 (23\/03\/04) Despite this apparently negative \npicture, some agents within the wine industry prefer to focus on more positive stories \nand point to both industry-wide and grassroots initiatives as evidence that progressive \nchange is taking place. In what follows, we outline some examples of these initiatives \nand examine the extent to which retailers and consumers provide a potent force that can \naccelerate change.   \nPathways for transformation and the market imperative \nAgainst the backdrop of apartheid legacies, the varying dimensions of the challenge of \ntransforming the wine industry are succinctly summarised by Nosey Pieterse, President \nof the Black Association of the Wine and Spirits Industry (BAWSI): \nThere can be no transformation in the absence of transformation of \nownership. There can be no transformation in the absence of \ntransforming the control of the industry. There can be no transformation \nin the absence of transforming our skills base\u2016 (National Library of South \nAfrica 2004 emphasis added).  \nAs discussed, the legislative and moral imperatives provide a limited impetus to effect \nsocio-economic transformation, but this has generated a range of initiatives within the \nindustry itself. These can be broadly classified into two categories. Firstly, industry-wide \nbodies are seeking to facilitate transformative processes within the various components \n 15 \nof the value chain. Secondly, a number of small-scale initiatives have emerged in \nvarious guises from the \u2017grassroots\u2018 with the aim of engendering localised socio-\neconomic change mainly at the level of individual wine farms. The following discussion \nexplores case studies from each of these kinds of initiative.  \nIndustry-wide initiatives \nIn 1999, the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI) South African wine pilot was set in motion by \nthe UK government\u2018s Department for International Development (DfID). The ETI\u2018s \nremit is to find ways of upgrading the ethical dimensions of international trade via \nformalised systems of inspection. This bold initiative operates via a tripartite alliance \ncomprising corporations, NGOs and trade unions. The South African wine industry was \nselected as one of the ETI\u2018s pilot programmes through which the processes for setting, \ninspecting and reporting upon international labour standards could be tested. The pilot \nsuccessfully assisted South African partners in developing and refining inspection \nmethodologies for monitoring on-farm labour standards and was pivotal in bringing \nvarious industry stakeholders together for the first time. In response to its success, in \nNovember 2002 South Africans took ownership of the pilot\u2018s objectives and set up the \nWine Industry Ethical Trade Association, a not-for-profit, voluntary organisation \nseeking to promote the ideals of ethical trade in the local wine industry. WIETA has \nbeen described as the \u2015jewel in the crown\u2016 (ETI representative Simon Steyne quoted in \nDistell 2002) of the ETI\u2018s worldwide initiatives: \n\u2026[setting the] parameters for implementing and auditing ethical labour \npractices and working conditions in the Winelands. It is unique in the \nworld and has drawn praise from human rights groups. (ibid.).  \n 16 \nWIETA is managed through an executive committee comprising individuals \nrepresenting different interest groups within the industry, including the export \npromotions agency Wines of South Africa (WOSA), organised labour, NGOs and the \nDepartment of Labour. As of April 2004, approximately 50 producers, suppliers and \nother interested parties had opted to become members, including major firms such as \nKWV, Distell, Vinfruco and Western Wines and individual farms and estates such as \nBeyerskloof, Villiera, Neil Ellis and Louisvale. WIETA has established a code of good \npractice based on the ETI base code and South African legislation (WIETA 2003). Key \nprinciples include: no child labour; freely chosen employment; the right to a healthy and \nsafe working environment; the right to freedom of association; non-excessive working \nhours; the right to a living wage; prohibition of unfair discrimination; rights to worker\u2018s \nhousing and tenure security. This is monitored through a social auditing inspection \nprocess that is complemented by efforts to educate producers and workers about the \ncontent of the code and its practical implementation. Indeed, the initial work of WIETA \nhas been heavily focused upon education, with the early inspections in particular being \nseen as part of a broader learning process both for WIETA and the producers concerned. \nThe imperative is to establish a dynamic upward trajectory of improvement in social \nconditions on farms rather than to \u2017fail\u2018 or shame producers. \nWIETA is one of several \u2017empowerment-focused\u2018 wine industry bodies. The \nSouth African Wine and Brandy Company (SAWB) is a not-for-profit entity created by \nrepresentatives of the wine producers, cellars, labour and wholesale merchants (SAWB \n2004). It is involved in implementing the Wine Industry Plan, which seeks to develop \nthe industry as \u2015an internationally respected vine-products provider\u2016 (National Library \n 17 \nof South Africa 2004). It is facilitating transformation through the production of a \nscorecard system that rates individual companies according to their achievements in \ndelivering empowerment. Membership of the Black Association of the Wine and Spirits \nIndustry (BAWSI) is drawn from trade unions, civil society and black-owned small \nbusinesses; it has been particularly vocal in campaigning for black people to be given \nopportunities to gain business and technical skills required to participate in the industry. \nThe South African Wine Industry Trust (SAWIT), funded by a ten year grant from \nKWV, manages two Article 21 companies: Busco, which is oriented towards the \nprovision of business support and Devco, which assists new entrants to the industry, \nexisting workers and their communities in accessing enhanced opportunities via the \nprovision of education and training.  \nGrassroots initiatives \nA number of wine estates are associated with projects that seek explicitly to empower \nworkers (WOSA 2004a), which have emerged through the initiative of individual estate \nowners and worker\/community organisations (Wesgro 2003). The precise business \nmodels deployed vary from case-to-case but many have been categorised as \u2017worker \nequity schemes\u2018 (Karaan 2004). A defining characteristic of the vast majority has been \nthat workers have gained legal rights to the means of production, often by redirecting \ntheir housing grant entitlement towards the purchase of land (National Library of South \nAfrica 2004). Farmers with a \u2017progressive social conscience\u2018 are usually the instigators \nof such schemes. Typically the workers\u2018 group engages in the production of wines under \nits own label. The name of the wine and the content of the back label usually make \n 18 \nreference to the empowerment credentials of the product and its contribution to the \ntransformation process in South Africa. For example: \nFairview winery\u2026is headed by Charles Back, a leading South African \nwineman with a progressive social conscience. He has been \ninstrumental in encouraging the setting up of the Fair Valley Workers\u2019 \nAssociation, a workers\u2019 co-operative which reinvests money back into \nimproving education and housing. This venture truly represents their \ncountry\u2019s new found freedom and enterprise [Three Worlds 2000 red \nwine, retailed by Co-op]. \nOther well-known examples include \u2017Winds of Change\u2018, \u2017Freedom Road\u2018 and \u2017Thandi\u2018, \nthe latter being the first wine in the world to receive Fairtrade accreditation (WOSA \n2004b). These initiatives have attracted considerable attention both from within the \nindustry and from wider media. Several of the projects have achieved notable export \nsuccess.  \nAmongst the most well known is \u2017New Beginnings\u2018, which produced the first \nwine ever to be made by people of colour from grapes grown on their own land (Mohale \n2003). The project initiator was Alan Nelson, a Cape Town legal advocate who bought \nthe Nelson\u2018s Creek estate in the early 1990s. This had suffered bankruptcy under its two \nprevious owners and consequently had \u2015a hopeless, quagmire atmosphere and the vines \nwere neglected\u2016 (Hiney 2002). In order to motivate his workforce, who had suffered the \nnegative effects of the dop system for many years, Nelson promised to donate land if the \nestate produced an award winning wine (Anon 2001; Nelson's Creek Wine Estate 2000). \nTwo awards followed and in 1997 Nelson donated 9.5ha to a workers cooperative on \n 19 \ncondition that it was used for agricultural purposes (Mohale 2003). Furthermore, if the \nworkers chose wine production Nelson stated that the co-operative could either have \naccess to his equipment and hi-tech cellar or he would purchase their grapes. It was also \nagreed that the workers would cultivate their land in their spare time, as they remained \nemployees of Nelson\u2018s Creek (Anon 2001).  \nThe workers gained further assistance through the National Department of Land \nAffairs, which recognised the initiative as a land reform project (Mohale 2003). Support \nwas garnered from a number of sources including the department of agricultural \neconomics at the University of Stellenbosch, Elsenberg Agricultural College and KWV \n(Anon 2001). Agronomists advised that the cultivars presently grown on the land were \ninappropriate in the context of the prevailing terroir. A proportion of the existing vines \nwas removed and new varieties planted. In 1998, the co-operative harvested its first \ngrapes. The project quickly caught the imagination of the media and shortly after a \nbroadcast on national television the retail chain Pick \u2017n Pay agreed to buy all the \navailable stock (Anon 2001; Mohale 2003). Representatives from the co-operative \nsubsequently attended Trade Fairs in Europe and further media attention led to interest \nfrom Dutch importers. In order to meet market demand the co-operative sourced in \ngrapes from another estate. An agreement was made with Alan Nelson that once the \noriginal stock had been sold to Pick \u2017n Pay, he would meet the costs of sourcing and \nproducing additional wine and that the profits would be divided 50-50 with the New \nBeginnings co-operative under whose label the wine would be sold.  \n Using income from their initial sales the New Beginnings co-operative bought a \nfurther 9ha of land and a truck and trailer. In terms of social dividends all the local \n 20 \nchildren are able to attend school, receiving funding to pay their fees, transport and \nuniform costs (Botha 2002). Each co-operative member now has their own life insurance \npolicy and retirement fund and each family has received a cash dividend of R6500. \nDuring 2004, the co-operative announced an innovative cash-raising scheme whereby a \nprivate individual or company can \u2015adopt a vine\u2016 (Titus 2004). The cash raised will \nfacilitate further investments in the vineyard without taking risks associated with formal \nbank loans. In the longer term, the co-operative members aim to expand their \nproduction, create their own cellar, construct their own housing and enhance local \neducation facilities. The project has drawn a great deal of media and government \nattention because its declared ideals resonate with those of the \u2017new South Africa\u2018 (Anon \n2001; Hiney 2002; Mohale 2003). Similarly, Thandi wines were served to Queen \nElizabeth at a recent state function; Freedom Road, Fair Valley and Villeria were served \nexclusively at British Labour Party functions during 2003. The criteria governing \nselection were \u2015quality of the wines and the wineries\u2018 progressive policies in supporting \nempowerment and security of land tenure for their farm workers\u2016 (Anon 2003).  \nWorker equity land transfers represent just one form of transformation scheme \n(Karaan 2004). Winds of Change wines are made in association with the Sonop estate. \nFor each bottle sold approximately \u00a31 is re-invested in community projects such as \nhousing and education (Low 2001). The Freedom Road project on the Backsberg Estate \nuses the profits from the sale of wines for upgrading worker housing (WOSA 2004b). A \nworkers\u2018 vintage port is produced on the Helderkruin estate using the raisiny grapes left \nat the end of harvest (WOSA 2004b). The profits are used to fund social upliftment \nprojects. Other models of empowerment focusing upon black business ownership are \n 21 \nemerging. The Lindiwe wine cellar, which sources its grapes from external estates and \nfarms, is owned by BEE company Reinvest Ltd, which pays a proportion of profit \ndividends to BAWSI (Lindiwe Wines 2004). At the other end of the spectrum successful \nblack businessmen, such as leading ANC figure Tokyo Sexwale, are purchasing wine \nfarms in their own right (du Bois 2004; Fisher 2003).  \nThe role of consumers and retailers as drivers of change \nWithin the context of the enormous obstacles to change in the South African wine \nindustry, how might the emergence and apparent success of alternative approaches be \nexplained? In what ways are different forces operating to facilitate new initiatives that \nappear, at least on initial inspection, to approximate more closely to legislative and \nmoral imperatives? We want to suggest, in the case of the specific initiatives outlined \nabove, that international forces are of prime importance in shaping local level processes \nwithin the Western Cape. Obviously national political imperatives place discourses of \ntransformation and empowerment at the very heart of daily life in South Africa and these \nhave emerged as an urgent response to the legislative and moral context. As Su Birch \n(CEO of WOSA) observes, \u2015given our history, it [transformation] is simply a thing we \nhave to do\u2016 (Distell 2002). However, for any new initiatives to progress it is crucial that \nthey are able to connect with a market. Furthermore, it can be argued in this case that the \nexistence of an international market is the ultimate facilitator of wine industry \ninitiatives. As Pearson and Seyfang (2001: 53) observe: \nWorker\u2018s interests are articulated in the market place, where product \nchoice and market shares are increasingly influenced by consumer \npreferences and perceptions about ethical labour practices.  \n 22 \nThus, consumers are playing ever-greater roles in influencing practices at the point of \nproduction in a range of industries across the globe. We suggest that different facets of \nconsumer demand, which are in turn mediated by supermarket retailers through \ncommodity networks, are perhaps the crucial link allowing these initiatives to become \nestablished.  \n UK-based retailers have been a significant influence upon the development of \ntransformation initiatives. Many of the wines emanating from grassroots initiatives are \nsold in major UK supermarkets. Tesco and Waitrose, for example, were amongst the \nfirst to support Thandi wines. Furthermore, retailers were instrumental in the creation of \nWIETA. High levels of retailer buy-in were achieved during the ETI pilot, particularly \nfrom the Co-op, Sainsbury and Tesco. The subsequent extension of the pilot into a fully-\nfledged, locally-managed association has been strongly supported by these firms who, \nalong with Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Asda, Threshers and Somerfield, have been \ninvolved in consultation exercises with WIETA\u2018s chief executive. UK retailers \ncontribute heavily to the funding of WIETA by donating their share of the EU Common \nCustoms Tariff rebate (granted to South Africa in exchange for dropping the terms \n\u2017sherry\u2018 and \u2017port\u2018 on its products) back to the South African wine industry.  \n Retailer pressure has been extremely important in encouraging producers to join \nWIETA. Both the ETI and subsequently WIETA have faced resistance and often \nhostility from some quarters within the local industry. As a member of WIETA\u2018s \nexecutive board explains (25\/03\/04), more conservative producers have responded to \nthese initiatives by asking bitterly: \u2015Why us? Again?\u2016 suggesting South African \nproducers are being unfairly singled out for criticism by international observers; WIETA \n 23 \nhas also experienced difficulties in recruiting members. Others take an alternative view \nand instead perceive opportunity rather than threat: WIETA is a \u2015smart high plus in \nupmanship on numerous other producer countries\u2016 (Distell 2002), providing: \n\u2015something\u2026that makes our wines stand out\u2016 (Sawit Chairman Gavin Pieterse quoted in \nMorris 2003). Quite simply, \u2015it will play out greatly to South Africa\u2018s advantage if \nworkers\u2018 rights and working and living conditions are beyond question\u2016 (Distell 2002). \nThe importance of \u2017standing out\u2018 in a marketplace crowded with dynamic, competitively \npriced New World wines cannot be underestimated. It is in this context that export-\noriented producers see more value in participating; indeed, it is doubtful whether \nWIETA could exist were membership not perceived by an increasing number of \nsuppliers as a way of securing an export contract with retailers.  \nThe decision by UK retailers to support WIETA and to stock individual \nempowerment wines is largely driven by a need to respond to contemporary consumer \ndemands. Consumer campaigns and boycotts are effective methods for forcing \ncorporations to take greater responsibility for labour standards (see for example \nEthicalconsumer.org 2003; Sweatshopwatch.org 2003). Retailers have become \nincreasingly responsive to the need to maintain a \u2017clean\u2018 image and avoid damaging \nconsumer protests (Gatehouse 1989; Klein 2000; Ross 1997). By sourcing wines from \nempowerment projects and WIETA members, retailers are ensuring that they are offered \nsome protection from the criticism that could result from an expos\u00e9 of labour practices \nin the industry. Retailers are aware that South African products remain a source of \nvulnerability, as a proportion of the consumer population is likely to be sensitive to \nrevelations that some apartheid-era inequalities remain. Furthermore, the ongoing \n 24 \ntroubles in Zimbabwe are focusing extra attention on land-based industries in the \nSouthern African region. As several industry insiders pointed out, retailers can point to \ntheir support for the individual wine projects and their membership of WIETA as \nevidence of their non-complicity in the more iniquitous elements of the industry. In this \nsense retailer involvement in transformation endeavours plays a defensive, damage \nlimitation role within their broader corporate strategy. Codes of conduct, such as those \ndeveloped through WIETA, have thus become a necessary business protocol offering a \nrelatively inexpensive measure to protect corporate reputations. Furthermore, the process \nof ensuring that suppliers meet acceptable standards is rendered much simpler if it can \nbe managed through a single organisation. Many observers believe that in time some \nretailers may seek to source all their South African wines from WIETA members. \nAlternative trade also offers corporations non-price advantages with which to gain \nleverage over competitors (Barrientos 2000). Retailers can tap into positive consumer \nbehaviour, which involves actively seeking out products that have been deemed fair or \nethical. Such behaviour tends to be the preserve of a small, albeit fast growing, niche \namongst the population (Mintel 2001; Mintel 2002). Contemporary ethical purchasing is \nbased on extensive understandings of working conditions around the world and has \nprogressed considerably from the \u2017warm glow\u2018 of socially responsible shopping \n(Howard 1995). The New Economics Foundation found that: \nnot only [are] consumers concerned, they [are] actively engaged \u2013 and \nregularly reward those companies who produce their goods in more \nsocially and environmentally friendly ways. (Doane 2001: 4) \n 25 \n The growth of the ethical consumer category is illustrated by the fact that sales of fair \ntrade goods, for example, are estimated to be worth US$400 million worldwide and \ninvolve over 4.5 million producers and their families in 36 countries (The Fairtrade \nFederation 2002).  In addition, changing commodity cultures in the UK have seen wine \nbecome an everyday rather than a luxury product, which has undoubtedly created \nopportunities for ethically-traded South African wines. \nFor more ethically concerned consumers, particularly those who can relate to the \nera of consumer boycotts, there is the added attraction of \u2017reversing the boycott\u2018 and \nmaking a positive contribution to post-apartheid South Africa. The labelling of wines \ntends to emphasise their self-proclaimed empowerment credentials. Thus, consumers are \nmade aware that their choice of wine has an ethical dimension. It can be argued that \nethically-produced wines from South Africa have an advantage in this regard as \nethically-minded consumers are likely to recognise the significance of social upliftment \nefforts. The vast majority of wines with ethical credentials on sale in the UK are sourced \nfrom South Africa. As mentioned previously, Thandi was the first Fairtrade Foundation \naccredited wine, whilst the Co-op sells two self-accredited South African sourced \nFairtrade wines. Interestingly, retailers have not tended to single out these wines for \npromotional purposes, partly because there is a fear that third parties could contest \nclaims of empowerment and stimulate negative publicity. Yet our research suggests that \nethically sensitive consumers are frustrated by a lack of information, particularly in \nrelation to South African produce. Indeed, 80% of respondents in our survey of former \nAnti-Apartheid Movement members expressed an interest in finding out more about \n 26 \nethical and fair-trade produce from South Africa; ninety percent stated they would make \na conscious effort in the future to buy products referred to in our survey.  \nAssessing transformative initiatives in South Africa  \nIt can be argued that western-based consumers are providing a market opportunity that \nfacilitates the evolution of transformation initiatives within the South African wine \nindustry. Yet, the projects have been a source of local controversy and their outcomes \nmerit close interrogation. In this instance we briefly evaluate the socio-economic \ncontribution that these initiatives have made to their intended beneficiaries and consider \nthe extent to which they represent alternative pathways to socio-economic development. \nMore radical voices within the industry believe that the empowerment credentials \nof many of the grassroots equity share schemes are vastly overstated. Indeed, one \ninterviewee with direct experience of managing empowerment projects stated: \u2015Don\u2018t \nbother with empowerment wines, they are a farce\u2026 To build hopes around projects like \nthose is absurd\u2016 (11\/03\/04). For some observers the projects represent nothing more than \na subtle readjustment of the neo-paternalist order, as the worker ownership co-operatives \nremain dependent on the farmer for access to equipment, cellaring facilities, marketing \nsupport and access to sales networks; empowerment is impossible because of the \nembeddedness of these forms of dependency. Nosey Pieterse (Wardman 2004) refers to \na \u2015soup kitchen mentality\u2016 amongst farmers, suggesting that they are more interested in \nself-serving charitable projects than initiatives that could challenge the structural \ninequalities of the industry. An absence of meaningful training and genuine mentoring \nprecludes any significant advancement by the new shareholders. In fact a pernicious \nform of pseudo-empowerment occurs whereby individuals are under the illusion that as \n 27 \nowners of the means of production they have some form of power and control, whilst in \nreality they remain dependent upon the white farmer due to an absence of technical and \nbusiness knowledge transfer. According to critics there may be much talk about \nmentoring and training opportunities but relatively little actually occurs. The occasional \nindividual may experience upward social mobility and even become a symbol of the \nsuccess of a project but these individuals are atypical of the experience of the majority.   \n Some critics allege that white farmers become involved for business rather than \naltruistic reasons. Firstly, empowerment projects attract considerable favourable \npublicity for farmers, their estates and their products. The \u2017halo\u2018 effect allows these \nestates to differentiate themselves within a crowded market place. It is reported that one \nfarmer increased sales from his estate by 100% following the inception of a well-\npublicised worker empowerment project. Secondly, in the majority of cases the members \nof the co-operative continue to work on the farmer\u2018s estate as well as their own \nvineyard. An increase in productivity results from their increased sense of self worth and \ngratitude to their employer and may also occur due to increased technical expertise \ndeveloped through endeavours on their own plot. Thirdly, there are accusations that \nworker equity schemes are initiated to provide cash injections, via government housing \nand land reform grants, for farmers who might otherwise have faced bankruptcy.   \nModerate voices adopt a more nuanced stance. Certainly, some farmers are \ninvolved for self-serving reasons and here beneficial outcomes are restricted, but \nprojects should be evaluated according to whether workers have gained \u2015independence \nand self esteem\u2016 and represent \u2015a reduced burden on the state\u2016 (skills trainer, 31\/03\/04). \nKey indicators of social progress include raising incomes, the ability to save for a \n 28 \npension and gaining a permanent home. Such outcomes may not match the \nempowerment ideals held by more radical observers but in the context of overcoming \nenormous disparities they can be seen as pragmatic and progressive. Moderates do not \nsee material ownership of businesses or land as a central component of the process: \u2015not \neveryone can be an entrepreneur\u2016 (ibid.). Instead the focus should be upon developing a \nsense of ownership over the business process. Some of the more successful initiatives do \ninvolve highly structured training programmes, which are tailored according to local \nneeds, designed such that workers can gradually take increasing levels of responsibility \nand control, and ensuring that they gain competence in business and technical skills.  \n Our research suggests that at the local level the various worker equity schemes \nhave produced mixed results. Some have operated with inappropriate business models, \nsome have produced poor products and some have undoubtedly been prone to forms of \nelite capture. Yet, a number of communities have been afforded opportunities that would \nnot otherwise have been available to them and have gained notable social dividends; \nsome individuals have gained previously unheralded opportunities that have enabled \nthem to advance their careers in ways that perhaps would not have been possible. Some \nprojects have been highly successful in commercial terms, with Thandi and New \nBeginnings proving that it is possible to produce award-winning wines and secure a \nmarket. Such projects still operate very much at the margins of the industry as a whole \nand appear dependent upon their \u2017empowerment credentials\u2018 to secure a market niche, \nbut optimists believe that in time they will be able to break into new markets, such as the \nAfrican-American and emerging black South African middle class, and thus face a \nsecure future. Others believe that the novelty will soon wear off and that other, more \n 29 \nsustainable, approaches to empowerment and transformation must be identified and \nimplemented.  \n The extent of local contestations over the value of worker equity-type projects \nshould not be underestimated, particularly the necessity for these to be branded as \n\u2017empowerment\u2018 or \u2017transformation\u2018 projects in order to attract government monies and \nthe eyes of retailers and consumers. Without such branding they would almost certainly \nstruggle to attain a niche within the marketplace. Of course, marketing by its very nature \nexaggerates and invents realities but the seemingly casual utilisation of the very \nlanguage that represents ongoing internal struggles in South Africa is problematic to \nmany. Certainly there are justified concerns that whilst these schemes do bring benefits \nto those involved the sum of these benefits does not equate to a truly emancipatory form \nof empowerment. Critics are vehement in their belief that the initiators of these schemes \nshould be honest about the limitations of the socio-economic ambitions of the projects.  \n At this stage it is too early to assess the fullness of the impacts of industry-wide \ninitiatives. At the time of writing, WIETA has completed a year of social auditing and \nforty-two members have passed through an initial inspection process. The results show \nboth success stories where producers are complying, particularly in providing a living \nwage and avoiding child labour, and areas where labour standards are consistently low \n(http:\/\/www.wieta.org.za\/news.html, accessed 01\/06\/05). However, its supporters are \noptimistic about its potential to make a significant contribution to improved on-farm \nlabour standards and to form part of a wider process facilitating empowerment within \nthe industry. There is no pretence that this is straightforward. Indeed, South Africa\u2018s \ncomplex political history is a stumbling block that constantly requires skilled \n 30 \nnegotiation. As a WIETA board member notes: \u2015we have to get past all that stuff every \ntime before we can get down to business\u2016 (01\/04\/04). Discussions around the multiple \nmeanings and interpretations of empowerment feature heavily in debates. The fact that \nsuch debates are occurring and ultimately feeding into WIETA policy is a symbol of \nWIETA\u2018s initial success. Debate is in part fed by the various experiences of grassroots \ninitiatives, which provide case examples of the trials and tribulations of transformation \nin action. In this sense grassroots initiatives are fundamentally important in providing \nconcrete evidence of the structural factors impinging upon and facilitating change in \nSouth Africa\u2018s land-based industries.   \nGrassroots initiatives and WIETA might be perceived as representing alternative \npathways to socio-economic development through their efforts to improve the \nlivelihoods of the previously disadvantaged. At present WIETA\u2018s ambitions are, in fact, \nlimited to ensuring the full application of national laws. However, these laws are widely \nseen by supporters of labour as highly progressive and advanced in international terms. \nIf WIETA is able to achieve full legal compliance within the industry it is likely that \nSouth African farm workers will benefit from better working conditions than the \nmajority of their counterparts in other wine growing regions. These initiatives have \nestablished that markets for wines labelled as \u2017ethical\u2018 do exist, despite the mocking \ntones of some local and international actors who state that consumers do not want their \nwine to be \u2017political\u2018 or too \u2017overtly African\u2018 (Thiel 2003; WOSA 2003). On the \ncontrary, as our research suggests, there is significant consumer interest in such \nproducts, the full extent of which has probably not yet been fully exploited. The ACTSA \nsurvey results suggest that ethically aware consumers are confident that their \n 31 \ninterventions can make a difference and that they desire more information on \nprogressive initiatives that are already in existence. Despite limited concerted change in \nthe wine industry these projects have also provoked debate and provide a focus for \nevaluation and discussion within the industry\u2018s more progressive forums, with concrete \ncase histories of land reform and business models that have been implemented on a \nsmall-scale. The ways in which different sets of power relations play out is particularly \ninformative, enabling analysts within the industry and government to formulate \nprogressive ways forward. Debates over the practical meanings of empowerment and \ntransformation are particularly important. Various stakeholders ascribe very different \nmeanings to the terms but the establishment of these initiatives is part of a process of \nsetting a tone within the industry, reinforcing the imperative of transformation and \nidentifying challenges that are situated within local and global power structures.  \nStruggles ahead \nAs with the national context, the transformation process within the South African wine \nindustry has been slow to gather momentum. It can be argued that the scene is set for \nchange but for meaningful transformation to become a reality a number of struggles \nremain. We highlight three to illustrate the types of global and local constraints that need \nto be confronted before progressive change is embedded through alternative trade \nsystems.  \nThe entrenched, institutionalised conservatism of the wine industry is clearly one \nsignificant barrier to rapid change. Whilst pressures may be exerted through ethical \ninitiatives, national legislation and western-based retailers and consumers the capacity of \nthe industry elite to absorb these pressures is formidable. Whilst there may be gradual \n 32 \nimprovements in farm labour standards, albeit from a low base, significant shifts in \nmindset are required for full compliance to become the norm. Significant changes in \npatterns of land ownership and in the racialised division of labour within the industry are \nunlikely to occur in the short to medium term. Moreover, like much of South African \nagribusiness (du Toit 2003), its precise modus operandi remains unclear to external \nobservers. Overcoming the machinations of this power bloc is an enormous challenge \nfor agents of change particularly as such a high proportion of the industry\u2018s human and \nsocial capital has been invested in these individuals and their networks.  \nWestern retailers have thus far been portrayed as constructive agents within this \npaper; however, their actions in relation to the management of supply chains pose \nconsiderable challenges. The apparent hypocrisy of the supermarkets, described by one \nsenior wine industry figure as \u2015foul and ferocious\u2016 (09\/03\/04), has been well \ndocumented (Barrientos 2000; du Toit 2001; du Toit 2002; Hughes 2000; Hughes 2004; \nHughes 2005). They insist upon the implementation of various production standards \nfrom their suppliers but they compromise these very processes by insisting that suppliers \nshould meet the full costs of compliance. This, coupled with increased downward \npressure upon prices, leaves producers with very tight profit margins. Scope for \ninvesting in the needs of workers thus tends to be limited. Resolving such conflicts is \ncertainly a challenge. Fairtrade products circumnavigate such concerns to an extent \nthrough the recognition that they include a premium paid directly to the producers\u2018 \ncommunity. Debates are ongoing within WIETA as to whether an ethical labelling \nprocess might bring commercial benefits to its members. \n 33 \nThe precise content and methodology of compliance codes is a further arena for \nconsideration (du Toit 2001; Ethical Trading Initiative 2004). Defining criteria by which \nproducers should be assessed is a highly complicated process and was the subject of \nmuch controversy during the ETI pilot. Such codes tend to be devised by actors in the \nglobal north, who operate with the sensibilities of northern consumers in mind rather \nthan the locally specific needs of a given region in the global south. (Child labour is a \nmuch-cited example of an issue driven by northern concerns rather than realities \nelsewhere. Codes that prevent children from formal employment can increase financial \ninsecurity of households force children into the informal economy. The exploitation of \nchild labour requires attention but also sophisticated locally-specific responses rather \nthan blanket bans to appease the simplistic prejudices of northern constituencies.) For \nWIETA there are undoubted tensions to be confronted in terms of devising and applying \ncriteria that are locally appropriate rather than ones indiscriminately imposed by \nretailers. Similar debates are ongoing within the Fairtrade community. The market for \nFairtrade goods has risen rapidly in the last decade and the concomitant need to increase \nsupply has led to Fairtrade principles being tested under completely different political, \nhistorical and institutional contexts. Applications for Fairtrade accreditation have risen \nexponentially in the last two years within South Africa. Yet, the criteria, which appear to \nhave worked well when applied to smallholder production in other parts of the world, \nare less applicable to this context. As Kruger and Hamann (2004 p.10) observe: \nSurely it will be a supreme irony if white commercial farmers, who ten \nyears ago faced sanctions, are now rewarded with Fairtrade status \nwithout having contributed to social change in South Africa. \n 34 \nThere is clearly a need for increased southern agency in devising and applying ethical \nand Fairtrade criteria.  \n At the other end of the value chain lies the domestic consumer, in whose name \nthe retailers claim to act (Cook et al. 1998). We argue that there is a pressing need for \nproducers and consumers to become more directly connected in terms of information \nflows. At present consumers are represented by retailers, yet are left in the dark as to the \noutcomes of action undertaken in their name. They lack readily available and digestible \nsources of information about the full origins of the produce they purchase and the \nconditions under which it has been produced. Great leaps of faith are required, as \nconsumers have to accept that Fairtrade produce is always socially progressive and that \nretailers that are signatories to ETI and WIETA are not knowingly selling commodities \nproduced in socially unacceptable conditions. The complexity of commodity networks is \na significant issue in this regard. An individual wine cellar, for example, may operate to \nhigh social standards, yet can consumers be assured that the various vineyards from \nwhich it sources its grapes meet the same standards? \nConclusions \nSince the end of apartheid the South African wine industry has emerged from a highly \nregulated past into a globalised and highly competitive market. For over a decade the \nindustry has been in a state of flux and is still characterised by \u2017winners\u2018 and \u2017losers\u2018 \njostling to gain and maintain an edge within the market. Thus far the winners have been \nthose who can adopt the latest technologies, replant with desirable cultivars, produce \nquality wines, keep their production costs to a minimum and secure prized contracts \nwith western retailers. The losers have been the smaller estates and co-operatives that \n 35 \nlack sufficient capital to compete. Whilst the number of employment opportunities in the \nindustry has risen, real incomes and security remain low. Furthermore, Ewert and du \nToit (2004: 1-2) argue that: \nlivelihoods on wine farms in the Western Cape have been shaped by a \n\u2017triple transition\u2018 involving local industry de-regulation, international \nagro-food integration and the politics of democratisation and legal \nreform\u2026As modernity comes to the wine farms, new challenges and \nproblems come into being \u2013 challenges that existing South African \nparadigms of workplace transformation are inadequate to address. \nIt is in this context that a deepening divide has been identified in rural areas between \ndecreasing numbers of permanent employees, whose working and social conditions are \non the whole improving, and a growing proportion of casualised workers who bear the \nbrunt of producers\u2018 desires to keep down costs through flexibilisation (Ewert and du Toit \n2004).  \nThis backdrop of industry restructuring hardly appears to represent a fruitful \nenvironment within which to effect any form of progressive socio-economic \ntransformation. Yet, it is clear that despite international and local constraints a range of \nprogressive endeavours have been initiated. The wine industry has certainly appeared \npro-active in setting up an institutional matrix to meet the transformation challenge. \nVarious bodies with a transformation remit now exist, there have been a number of \nindustry conferences to discuss issues of transformation and initiatives are taking place \nat farm level. Whilst the scope of the ventures so far has been rather limited, a \n 36 \nmomentum for change is gathering and important precedents have been set such that \nmany local observers are optimistic that the industry is on the right track. \n Events currently unfolding within the Cape Winelands are highly complex, being \nsimultaneously influenced by an array of local, national and global factors. Sophisticated \nmeans of analysis are required in order to comprehend these ongoing processes. A \nnetwork approach is instrumental in assessing the inter-relationships between different \nactors involved in the production, distribution and consumption of South African wine. \nPower resides in certain key loci within the broader network, particularly the local wine \nindustry complex and a handful of powerful UK-based retailers. Forces within the local \nwine industry complex are extremely conservative in terms of their approach to socio-\neconomic change. It appears that overseas retailers and consumers are likely to be the \nmost potent agents of change within the industry, but the limits of this route to change \nmust be recognised. Whilst increased compliance with national BEE and employment \nlegislation will improve the livelihoods of many South Africans, the extent to which \nsuch change is truly transformative will undoubtedly be open to critical interrogation. \nUltimately the constraints of a highly competitive global market for wine will impose \nconsiderable pressure on production costs, which are invariably passed on to the least \npowerful members of the network \u2013 the workers. Although the retailers have been \ninstrumental in setting up WIETA and supporting individual initiatives, their sourcing \npolicies place considerable downward cost pressures on suppliers and are likely to \nseverely restrict transformative endeavours. Hope may be apparent through the future \ngrowth of the ethical consumption niche, which some observers are optimistic will offer \n 37 \nexcellent market opportunities for those suppliers who have been proactive in setting up \nethical production systems.  \nIn many ways this paper raises more questions that it answers. We have outlined \nthe main initiatives towards socio-economic upliftment and transformation within the \nSouth African wine industry and examined two of these routes in detail with particular \nreference to the global and local forces that shape them. There is a long way to go before \ntransformation becomes embedded within the daily practices of the industry. These \nprocesses are clearly of critical importance within South Africa as its post-apartheid \ntransition continues to unfold. More broadly lessons might be learned about the potential \nfor international trade to facilitate more equitable patterns of growth. In the case of \nSouth Africa such issues are high on the political agenda due to the imperatives \ngenerated by its recent history. Thus, efforts to effect re-distribution of wealth and \nopportunity are now being fast-tracked. These initiatives merit close interrogation in the \ncoming years. As Cook and Harrison (2003: 312) state, it is important for research to: \nlocate, document and critically analyse case studies where (formerly) \ncolonial people, communities and businesses have been able to capitalise \non fissures and counter logics within dominant accounts of global \ncapitalism. \nThe novel initiatives outlined in this paper certainly fit such a characterisation. Whether \nthey are ultimately able to become part of a broader international movement that \nchallenges the distribution of power within dominant accounts of global capitalism \nremains a question of critical importance. By highlighting the significance of multi-\nscalar struggles in the challenges facing ethical trade, we suggest that these initiatives \n 38 \nhave broader political relevance. As Allen et al. (2003: 62) argue localized struggles are \nheld in productive tension with broader international struggles. Initiatives within the \nSouth African wine industry are highly localized but also connected to international \nstruggles against the most pernicious effects of global capitalism and thus could contain \nthe seeds of broader social change. \nAcknowledgements \nCheryl McEwan and David Bek would like to acknowledge the support of the Nuffield \nFoundation (award number: SGS\/00909\/G); Karen Bek would like to acknowledge the \nsupport of ESRC (award number: PTA-030-2003-00856).
