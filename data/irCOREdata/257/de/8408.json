Projected contours enable Euler diagrams to scale better.\nThey enable the representation of information using less syntax and can\ntherefore increase visual clarity. Here informal reasoning rules are given\nthat allow the transformation of spider diagrams with respect to pro-\njected contours.\n1 Spider diagrams and projected contours\nA spider diagram [3] is an Euler diagram with plane trees (spiders) that represent\nthe existence of elements and shading in regions that indicate upper bounds on\nthe cardinalities of sets they denote. Projected contours [1, 2] here are dashed\nand non-projected contours are called given contours. The semantics of projected\ncontours are given in [1]: a projected contour represents the intersection of the\nset denoted by its label with the set denoted by its context (the smallest region,\ndefined in terms of given contours, that it intersects).\nd d '\nC o g\nD\nM\nC o m\nD\nM C o g\nC o m\nFig. 1. Two semantically equivalent spider diagrams.\nIn Fig. 1, let our universe of discourse be the people attending Diagrams 2004.\nLet M be the set of mathematicians, Cog be the set of cognitive scientists, Com\nbe the set of people able to turn a computer on, and D be the set of people\nable to draw a decent diagram. Both diagrams assert there is nobody who is\nboth a mathematician and a cognitive scientist, there is at least one cognitive\nscientist who can turn on a computer and only one mathematician who can draw\na decent diagram. Note that d2 does not assert that no mathematicians are able\nto turn on a computer, nor does it assert cognitive scientists are unable to draw\ndecent diagrams. The projected contour labelled D in d2 representsM \u2229D only.\nLikewise the projected contour labelled Com in d2 only denotes Cog \u2229 Com.\n2 Reasoning rules\nHere we introduce informally four of the reasoning rules that allow us to reason\nwith spider diagrams that contain projected contours. We illustrate their appli-\ncation by using them to transform the spider diagram in Fig.2 into the diagram\nof Fig.4. The transformation is illustrated in Fig.3.\nNote the spider diagram in Fig.2 asserts A \u2229B is non-empty and D is a subset\nof A \u222aB \u222a C (equivalently, in the complement of A \u222aB \u222a C, D is empty).\nC\nA B\nD\nd 1\nFig. 2. Initial spider diagram.\n1. Rule 1:Replacing a given contour with a projected contour. Ap-\nplying this rule may result in some of the existing projected contours being\nerased. (We apply Rule 1 to the given contour labelled D in d1 giving d2).\nd 2 d 3\nA\nD\nC\nB\nd 4\nd 5\nA\nD\nC\nB\nD\nA\nDC\nB\nd 6 d 7\nA\nD\nBA\nDC\nB\nC\nA\nD\nB\nC\nC\nFig. 3. Reasoning with projected contours.\n2. Rule 2:Splitting a projected contour allows us to replace a projected\ncontour with two projected contours that partition the context of the orig-\ninal. This rule is reversible. (We apply this rule to the projected contour\nlabelled D in d2 giving d3).\n3. Rule 3:Erasing a projected contour allows us to erase any projected\ncontour providing we also erase partial shading and leave at most one foot\nof each spider in a zone. (Applying this rule to d3 gives d4).\n4. In transforming d4 into d5 we use rule 1 to replace the given contour labelled\nC with a projected contour.\n5. Rule 4:Erasing a shaded zone allows us to erase any shaded zone pro-\nvided no spiders touch it and the resultant diagram still represents it by\neither exclusion or containment of contours. This rule is reversible. (We ap-\nply this rule to the shaded zone of d5 to give d6).\n6. To transform d6 into d7 we use rule 2 again, this time splitting the projected\ncontour labelled C. Finally, we transform d7 into d8 by erasing the projected\ncontour in A \u222aB using rule 3.\nB\nC\nA\nD\nd 8\nFig. 4. Resultant, semantically equivalent, spider diagram.\nWe have used four reasoning rules to transform d1 of Fig.2 into the semantically\nequivalent, and much clearer, d8 of Fig. 4. The reasoning rules 1-3 here could\nsimilarly be used in Fig.1 to transform d into d\u2032.\n3 Further work\nWork on a system of spider diagrams to include projected contours is progressing.\nSyntax, semantics and reasoning rules have been developed and formally defined\nand work is currently underway to show this extended system to be both sound\nand complete.
