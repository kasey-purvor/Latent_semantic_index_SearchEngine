Despite the onset of a global \nrecession, carbon trading breached the $120 billion mark in 2008, up from $64 billion in 2007 \n(Capoor and Ambrosi, 2009). Within a decade trading volumes could reach $1 trillion, \naccording to some market analysts, at which point the carbon market would start to rival \ncurrent trading in established commodities like oil, gas or gold.  \nGiven the likely rapid pace of growth in the carbon markets, this is a good moment in time to \nrecap the economic case for carbon trading and review market design options.  This paper is \none of a twin set of papers addressing what a global carbon market could look like by around \n2030, assessing design features relevant across time (this paper) and space (the companion \npaper).  The companion paper (Fankhauser and Hepburn, 2010) examines market design \nfeatures relevant to \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility, including key issues in linking national and regional \ncarbon markets together to create a global carbon market.  This paper examines design \nfeatures relevant to the temporal dimension and \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility, including banking and \nborrowing and other mechanisms that can provide greater carbon price predictability and \ncredibility over time.  \nCarbon markets look set to grow so quickly because of the recognition that any meaningful \nclimate change policy must put a (long-term) price on carbon (Stern 2007), which would \nideally provide private capital with a clear signal about the relative economics of low- vs high-\ncarbon infrastructure investment.  The need to price environmental externalities is a basic \nlesson from environmental economics (Baumol and Oates, 1988; Cropper and Oates, 1992). \nAdded to this, the long time horizons and magnitude of capital investment required to \naddress climate change imply spot carbon prices are not enough \u2013 politically credible long-\nterm prices are required.   \nThere are several ways of providing investors with the appropriate signal, including price-\nbased instruments (e.g. carbon taxes), quantity-based instruments (e.g. carbon trading) and \nany number of hybrid instruments, such as price caps and floors (Pizer 2002, Jacobi and \nEllerman, 2004, Philipbert 2009).  Under idealised textbook assumptions taxes and trading are \nessentially equivalent, but in real world situations there are important differences due to \nimperfect information, transaction costs, external shocks, and political economy \nconsiderations (Hepburn, 2006, 2007).1 \n                                                          \n1\n The key reference on taxes versus permits remains Weitzman (1974).  Hoel and Karp (2001) and \n  Carbon markets in time \n3 \nIn considering the temporal aspects of carbon market design, it is helpful to remember that \nthe choice between taxes and trading is not strict.  There are ways to create hybrid \ninstruments that blend price-based and quantity-based features, and hybrid instruments may \nbe superior in several dimensions, including in reducing price volatility and increasing long-\nterm credibility, discussed below. \nThe core benefit of hybrid systems is that they provide policy makers with greater control \nover the supply curve of emissions allowances.  Like all markets, the market for emission \nreductions has a demand curve, determined by the marginal abatement costs of regulated \nentities, and a supply curve, which is determined by policy. Under a pure tax system, the \nsupply of allowances is infinitely elastic. The market is effectively supplied with as many \nallowances as agents wish to buy at a fixed price (the tax rate). Under a pure allowance \nsystem, supply is completely inelastic as the amount of allowances is exogenously fixed.  \nHybrid systems allow policy makers to create a supply curve that is neither fully flat (a pure \ntax) nor fully vertical (pure cap-and-trade) but (stepwise) upward sloping.   \nThe slope of the supply curve \u2013 that is, the ability to adjust supply over time \u2013 is linked to a \ncritical design choice on the demand side: the degree to which compliance installations may \nspread emissions reductions over time. Such \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility is crucial to make carbon \nmarkets a cost-effective instrument for emission control. It allows market participants to \nminimise compliance costs over time.  In principle, the more \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility is built into the \ndemand side, the more cost-effective a market is likely to be.  The rules on banking and \nborrowing of allowances within and between periods can also have strong effects on the \nliquidity and efficiency of the trading system. \n \u201cWhen\u201d flexibility is maximised by full liberalisation of markets across time.  However, there \nare factors that counsel against this. Most markets limit intertemporal arbitrage \u2014 the \namount of banking and borrowing \u2014 in order to avoid time inconsistency problems, for \ninstance. In this paper, we explore some of these challenges and suggest design features that \nmay help to overcome them.  \nThe structure of this paper is as follows.  Section 2 sets out some \u201cfirst principles\u201d of design \nwith respect to temporal issues that are woven throughout the rest of the paper.  Our focus is \non firm-level trading systems, although much of what we say would also apply to \n                                                                                                                                                                        \nNewell and Pizer (2003) have extended the Weitzman result to stock pollutants such as CO2, where \ndamage does not depend on the flow of emissions but on their accumulation in the atmosphere. \n  Carbon markets in time \n4 \ngovernment-level trading (e.g., AAU trading under the Kyoto Protocol). In section 3, temporal \ndesign elements are considered in more detail, including banking and borrowing and other \nmechanisms to provide greater carbon price predictability and credibility over time.  Section 4 \nconcludes.  \n  Carbon markets in time \n5 \n2 First principles of carbon market design \u2013 \ntemporal issues \nAs our companion paper notes (Fankhauser and Hepburn 2010), the cost-effectiveness of \nclimate policy is critical to its success or failure, because (i) our willingness to pay is limited \nand (ii) the costs of mitigation are substantial (see also Aldy and Barrett 2003).   Costs are \nsignificantly reduced by allowing flexibility in when (and also where) emissions reductions \noccur.  Abatement is generally cheaper if investment coincides with the natural renewal cycle \nof the capital stock. Retrofits or the premature replacement of equipment are expensive. \nSimilarly, firms may need \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility to smoothen out fluctuations in the business \ncycle, manage their debt levels or take advantage of expected innovations.  Furthermore, \ncosts are reduced when carbon price volatility is lower, as this implies a lower risk (or reduced \ncost of hedging risk) created when carbon markets are relied on to provide an adequate \nreturn on investments in low-carbon infrastructure. \n2.1 Price volatility \nPrice volatility is not necessarily a social problem; it is a natural feature of any well-\nfunctioning market and may reflect changes in underlying fundamentals (for example a \nchange in oil prices).2  As such, we distinguish between market-induced price volatility, which \nis not necessarily socially problematic, and volatility resulting from or exacerbated by \nregulatory design, which is undesirable and should be minimised through better market \ndesign.  We now consider the impact of market design on price volatility. \nTo provide some formal structure, assume that the demand for permits Qd from firms is \nlinear3 and described by:  \n (1) \nwhere P is the permit price, \u03b2d is the slope of the demand schedule and \u03b1d is a demand \nparameter.  The supply of permits is determined by policy.  Assume that the supply of permits \nis linear, such that policy determines the relevant slope of the supply schedule:   \n (2) \n                                                          \n2\n In some markets, in particular asset markets, price volatility may also arises from the animal spirits of \ninvestors (Smith et al., 1988). \n3\n The Appendix provides a more general analysis with isoelastic demand and supply curves. \n  Carbon markets in time \n6 \nwhere \u03b2s is the slope of the supply schedule and \u03b1s is a parameter.  When supply is infinitely \nelastic, \u03b2s = \uf0a5, policy is effectively a pure carbon tax.  When supply is inelastic, \u03b2s = 0, policy is \na pure carbon trading scheme.  Hybrid schemes allow for intermediate values.   \nThe clearing price for permits is this: \n (3) \nConsider price volatility created by shocks to demand for permits (e.g. changes in relative coal \nand gas prices, or the introduction of new abatement technologies) rather than from policy \nshocks.  Assume that demand is uncertain and distributed normally such that: \n (4) \nThen one simple indication of price volatility is the variance of price, given by: \n (5) \nGiven this variance in price, the policy maker can adopt different design features to impact \nthe slope of the supply curve, \u03b2s, to minimise price volatility.  The impact of \u03b2s on price \nvariance is given by: \n (6) \nIn other words, increasing the slope of the supply curve \u03b2s, for instance by moving from a \ncarbon trading scheme, with a fixed cap and inelastic supply (\u03b2s = 0), to carbon taxes where \nsupply is infinitely elastic (\u03b2s \uf0ae\uf020\uf0a5), or a hybrid scheme, will reduce price volatility.  The key \npoint is that the policy maker has control over the shape of the supply curve. She can trade \noff price volatility and certainty of emission limits (Metcalf 2009). \nFigure 1 shows carbon price volatility as a function of the slope of the supply schedule for \nthree different values of the slope of the demand schedule.  Price volatility falls as the slope \nof the supply schedule is increased (i.e. as policy moves from trading to hybrids and taxes).  \nUnsurprisingly, price volatility also falls as the demand schedule becomes flatter. \n  Carbon markets in time \n7 \n \nFigure 1: Price volatility as a function of the slope of the supply schedule \n \nNote:  var(P) is normalised against the variance of an inelastic supply schedule when the slope of demand schedule is unity (100). \n2.2 When flexibility and long-term credibility \nThe theoretical insights on \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility suggest an efficient market has long-term \ncommitment periods, or \u201cphases\u201d, in which firms can freely bank or borrow their emissions \nallowances.   The length of the commitment period is important because (i) unlimited banking \nand some form of borrowing are generally allowed within commitment periods;4 and (ii) \nthere is normally clarity about the emissions cap for any given commitment period, but \nuncertainty about emissions cap for future commitment periods.5  An alternative to long \ncommitment periods would be to provide full scope for banking and borrowing of allowances \nbetween commitment periods to allow firms to optimise the time at which they reduce \nemissions. \nA market with long-term commitment periods and\/or banking and borrowing not only \nincreases \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility, it also increases liquidity by allowing firms to trade across time \n                                                          \n4\n For instance, the EU ETS Phase 2 allows unlimited banking between periods: EUAs of vintage 2008 \nmay be used for compliance in 2011.  Limited borrowing is allowed in that allowances for 2009 may be \nused for compliance for the 2008 period.   \n5\n The EU ETS aims to address this by extending the annual emission reduction target for phase III \n(1.74% p.a.) beyond the end of phase III. However, the target is of course subject to future review. \n  Carbon markets in time \n8 \nperiods.  Furthermore, long-term price signals would be expected to support stronger \ninnovation that creates new abatement opportunities. This has been a source of much recent \ndiscussion, with many observers questioning the strength of the dynamic signal of the EU ETS. \nIn reality, there are political and economic constraints preventing a very long-term carbon \nmarket with full temporal flexibility from emerging. The main constraint is on the extent to \nwhich firms can borrow, rather than bank, allowances between commitment periods. This is \nbecause: \n \n(i) the government may not be well-equipped to assess the credit worthiness and \nsolvency of firms who borrow allowances, who thereby become debtors. Moreover, \nfirms which are least solvent are likely to want to borrow more than firms which are \nmost solvent (a form of adverse selection); \n(ii) borrowing enables firms to delay action if they assume that targets will prove too \nonerous and will subsequently be softened (a time inconsistency issue); \n(iii) firms with borrowed allowances have an active interest to lobby for weaker targets, \nor even for scrapping emissions trading altogether, so that their debts are cancelled \n(a form of moral hazard). \n(iv) the political desire to (be seen to) act early, and potential benefits of early action, \nalso imply that politicians may prefer to place constraints on borrowing. \n \nThese concerns about borrowing imply that most trading systems do not allow borrowing \nbetween commitment periods, and often even limit borrowing within commitment periods.6  \nIn contrast, banking does not create such difficulties: firms with banked allowances have a \nvested interest in higher prices and the continuation of the system, to maximise the value of \ntheir allowance assets.  Banking can also prevent a price collapse between commitment \nperiods.  For these reasons, most emissions trading systems have allowed banking in some \nform.  A notable exception is phase I of the EU ETS, where banking was not allowed and the \nprice duly collapsed at the end of the period. \nWhen there are limits on borrowing between periods, but some borrowing allowed within \nperiods, it follows that the length of the commitment period is relevant to \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility \nand to market efficiency.  Period length is also relevant when investments to reduce \nemissions require many years for investors to recover their costs (including the cost of \ncapital).  If commitment periods are short, investors have to guess the emissions caps set by \nfuture governments, and attempt to anticipate changes in the underlying structure of the \n                                                          \n6\n Individual firms may, of course, borrow allowances from other regulated firms on a bilateral or \nexchange-cleared basis.  But such trades do not threaten the integrity of the system \n  Carbon markets in time \n9 \ncarbon trading framework.  These uncertainties significantly increase risk and reduce the \nlikelihood of low-carbon investments being made (Helm et al. 2003). In addition to providing \nbetter incentives for innovation, longer commitment periods are supported by the most \nrecent science, which suggests that cumulative emission targets to 2050 provides a more \nrobust approach to limiting the probability of temperature increases above 2oC (Allen et al., \n2009; Meinshausen et al., 2009).  Setting overall long-term targets has the additional benefit \nof leaving the optimal time path of emission reductions to the market, without policy makers \nneeding to second guess the dynamically efficient path.7    \nWhile short commitment periods create problems, they also have benefits.8  Short periods \nleave governments the flexibility to set future caps according to changes in science or in the \navailability of new abatement technologies.  Short periods may also be more credible, \nparticularly if they coincide with the electoral cycle. This has value. However, if governments \nwish to retain the benefits of short commitment periods, other mechanisms are likely to be \nneeded to address the shortcomings9 and to provide the private sector with appropriate long-\nterm incentives for low-carbon investment.10   \nWe now consider, in more detail, the design features that can overcome some of these \nlimitations to \u201cwhen flexibility\u201d, while seeking also to maintain \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility as much as \npossible. \n                                                          \n7\n The market will not necessarily provide price signals far into the future. Price formation is hampered \nby increasing uncertainty as forecasts extend further into the future. However, fixing long-term targets \nwould nevertheless remove one key aspect of uncertainty. \n8\n A discussion is provided by Hepburn (2006), who notes that the flexibility also brings additional costs, \none of which is the \u201chold up\u201d problem created by the fact that the government arguably has an \nincentive to adjust policy to address other objectives ex post firms have sunk resources into irreversible \nlow-carbon investment. \n9\n These include potential negative impacts of shorter periods on incentives to invest in longer-term \nlow-carbon research and innovation. \n10\n Examples include long-term carbon contracts (Helm and Hepburn, 2008) or issuing put options \n(Ismer and Neuhoff, 2009). \n  Carbon markets in time \n10 \n3 Temporal design options \nWe start from the theoretical ideal of long commitment periods (section 3.1), before noting \nthat a system with banking and borrowing between periods (section 3.2) can deliver largely \nthe same benefits.  In the absence of banking and borrowing, other mechanisms may be \nconsidered to smooth prices and provide clearer longer-term signals which may enhance \n\u201cwhen\u201d flexibility.  These include setting reserve prices in allowance auctions to ensure prices \ndo not fall too low (section 3.3), creating an \u201callowance reserve\u201d to be deployed if prices rise \ntoo high (section 3.4), or deploying more rigid price ceilings and floors (section 3.5).  The \nadvantages and disadvantages of each design feature are considered. \n3.1 Commitment period length \nSection 2 noted that banking and borrowing are often permitted (at least to some extent) \nwithin but not necessarily between commitment periods.11  For instance, in the EU ETS, there \nis full banking within a commitment period, because EUAs are valid throughout the \ncommitment period, in addition to banking between periods (Article 13).  In contrast, there is \nonly limited de facto borrowing within a commitment period, and no borrowing at all \nbetween commitment periods.  The de facto borrowing is made possible because operators \nare allocated their allowances for each year in February, but need to surrender units for the \nprevious year on 30 April, so they can effectively borrow one year ahead. Furthermore, as \nincreasingly higher proportions of allowances are auctioned, even this limited de facto \nborrowing within periods will be effectively phased out. \nWhen there are limits on banking or borrowing between periods, longer commitment periods \nallow greater temporal flexibility, smoothing prices, reducing costs and increasing liquidity.  \nFor instance, a single 10-year commitment period is equivalent to two 5-year commitment \nperiods where: \n\u2015 banking and borrowing between the two periods is allowed; and  \n\u2015 the second period cap is pre-announced and is credible. \n \n                                                          \n11\n It is important to draw the distinction between the \u201ccommitment period\u201d (for instance 2008-2012 in \nthe current Phase II) and the \u201ccompliance period\u201d, which is annually under the EU ETS where firms \nhave to submit the appropriate number of EUAs (or other recognised unit) to cover their emissions for \nthe previous year on 30 April.  Our discussion focuses on the length of commitment periods rather than \ncompliance periods. \n  Carbon markets in time \n11 \nLonger periods not only maximise \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility, they also reduce price volatility, and \nprovide the private sector with longer-term price signals which, if credible, should spur \ninnovation and investment.  However, longer periods reduce policymakers\u2019 flexibility to \nadjust targets in response to changing science or new abatement technologies.  Different \ntrading systems have struck the balance between these objectives in noticeably different \nways. \nFor instance, in the EU ETS, Phase I was a three year commitment period, with no banking or \nborrowing between Phase I and II.  While the scheme did appear to stimulate emission \nreductions (Ellerman and Buchner, 2007), three years was short, even for a \u201clearning phase\u201d.  \nThe Phase II commitment period is five years which is still arguably too short, although as \nnoted banking to Phase III is permitted.  Phase III has an eight years period, which appears to \nbe better matched with the relevant investment cycle, although firms are still faced with \nconsiderable uncertainty at the end of the 8-year Phase III period in 2020, unless Phase IV is \nnegotiated well in advance.  This is the case even though the Commission has stated that the \nannual reduction in the cap during Phase III would be extended into Phase IV. \nIn contrast, the Waxman-Markey draft bill sets out long-term reduction targets through to \n2050, providing greater clarity to investors on the time profile of abatement.  Allowances are \nto be reduced each year so that aggregate emissions under the system are reduced by 3% \nbelow 2005 levels in 2012, 20% in 2020, 42% in 2030, and 83% in 2050 (Section 702).  \nAlongside these long-term targets are unlimited banking and limited effective borrowing, \ndiscussed further in section 4.2 below, generating long-term signals with significant \u201cwhen\u201d \nflexibility for firms.  However, the bill also provides some flexibility for government: the US \nNational Academy of Sciences is required to submit a report every four years on the state of \nclimate science, the \u201ctechnological feasibility of achieving additional reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions\u201d, and an analysis of worldwide efforts (Section 705) and thus make \nrecommendations about making additional reductions.   \nThe proposed Australian Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (\u201cCPRS\u201d) provides a different \nmodel of how to address this balance between long-term price signaling and policy flexibility \n(Government of Australia, 2008; Jotzo and Betz 2009).  The CPRS provides firms with a certain \nemissions cap for five years into the future, with a \u201cgateway\u201d, or range of potential emissions \ncaps covering the next ten years, as shown in Figure 2.  Each year, the five-year cap and the \nten-year gateway are updated, so that at any given point in time the private sector has 15 \nyears of an indicative range of cuts and 5 years of a defined cap.  The use of rolling \ncommitment period that is updated annually avoids the sharp uncertainty between periods \nfrom which the EU ETS suffers. \n  Carbon markets in time \n12 \nFigure 2 Caps and gateways in the Australian CPRS \n \nSource: Government of Australia (2008) \n3.2 Banking and borrowing \nThe end of a commitment period provides the real risk of a price crash or spike if participants \nare unable to bank and borrow allowances respectively.  Without banking, if the market is \nslightly over-allocated (as in EU ETS Phase I), then the marginal allowance is worthless and the \nprice will collapse to zero (as it did).  Without borrowing, if the market is slightly under-\nallocated, then the value of the marginal allowance could spike to the penalty plus expected \nprice in the next phase (unless there are quick-to-implement abatement options that can be \ndeployed fast once the under-allocation becomes known).12   \nBanking and borrowing may also increase the scope for the government to softly and credibly \nmanage carbon prices so that they remain within a particular window.  Newell et al. (2005) \nnote that in a multi-period system with banking and borrowing, prices could be managed by \nagreeing that the stringency of targets in the next period automatically depend upon the \nrevealed price in the current period. \nThere are several even more significant advantages to banking, and very few drawbacks, \nwhich is why banking is now a widely adopted feature of emissions trading systems.  As \n                                                          \n12\n Another way of avoiding end-of-period price fluctuations is by opening the market to carbon offsets. \n  Carbon markets in time \n13 \nnoted, banking would have prevented the price crash observed in Phase I of the EU ETS, and \nindeed it is probably also playing a role in supporting prices in the current Phase II.  Banking \nhas several further advantages, namely that it: \n\u2015 effectively increases the depth and liquidity of the market, reducing price volatility by \nmaking current prices a function of a longer time span of activity, rather than being \nentirely determined by events today; \n\u2015 creates an incentive for firms to take early action to reduce emissions; \n\u2015 creates a private sector group with a vested interest in the success of the system, \nincluding an incentive to ensure rigorous monitoring and enforcement, as well as \ntight future targets, to protect and maximise the value of their carbon assets. \n \nBorrowing also enhances \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility and would also be likely to reduce price volatility.  \nHowever, in contrast to banking, unlimited borrowing has some significant drawbacks, noted \nin section 2, related to adverse selection, moral hazard, time inconsistency and the credit \nworthiness of borrowing firms.   \nFor these reasons, borrowing is currently limited, and is likely to remain so.  In the EU ETS, \nborrowing is restricted to a de facto interest free loan of one year\u2019s allowances (noted above), \nwhich is effectively being phased out as auctioning is brought in. After 2012, the EU ETS has \nretained the option of moving forward the auctioning of allowances from future years if \nmarket prices rise too high, providing the potential for a further form of borrowing within a \ngiven commitment period.   \nSimilarly, in the Waxman-Markey draft bill, rolling two-year compliance periods effectively \nallow operators to borrow one year ahead at a zero interest rate.  However, the Waxman-\nMarkey draft bill goes further than the EU ETS, and allowances from two to five years into the \nfuture can be borrowed (at an unspecified positive interest rate), up to a limit of 15% of the \ntotal obligation.   \nDifferences in banking and borrowing provisions do not preclude links between systems, but \nthey may pose important obstacles.  Systems with borrowing have risks to their \nenvironmental effectiveness if an operator borrows allowances and goes bankrupt before \nthey are repaid.  If this were a significant concern, one solution proposed is to limit purchases \nto allowances found ex post to be surplus to emissions in a compliance period from firms who \nhave not borrowed (Haites and Mullins, 2001).  Similarly, linking of one system with banking \nto another system with banking effectively creates a banking option for the system without \nbanking. \n  Carbon markets in time \n14 \n3.3 Auction reserve prices \nIn the absence of long commitment periods and banking or borrowing, governments may \nseek other mechanisms to minimise price volatility and to increase the dynamic efficiency of \nthe carbon market.  Governments may wish to provide support to carbon prices to ensure \nthat firms continue to have an incentive to reduce emissions (this section), or may want to \nensure prices do not rise too high (section 3.4), or establish more rigid price ceilings or floors \n(section 3.5). \nAs the proportion of allowances allocated by auction increases, one \u201csoft\u201d approach to \nmanaging the risk of low carbon prices13 is to set a reserve (or minimum) price for the \nperiodic auction of the allowances, such that no allowances would be sold onto the market if \nthe reserve price was not reached (Hepburn et al, 2006).  Auctions would need to occur at \nvarious points over the commitment period, as indeed is planned, rather than auctioning all \nof the allowances upfront.  Firms would not buy allowances at the auction if market prices \nwere below the reserve price, so the reserve price would serve to reduce the supply of \nallowances onto the market when prices were below the reserve price.  If a large enough \nproportion of allowances were auctioned, forward-looking market participants would \nanticipate a reduction in supply in the event of low prices, and adjust expectations so that \nmarket prices would be more likely to remain at or around the auction reserve price. \nThe logic of the approach is shown in Figure 3.  In a market without auctions, participants are \nprovided with free allocations up to quantity QCap, at which point the supply curve has a \nvertical component.  Further allowances are supplied through flexible mechanisms, such as \nthe CDM or JI.  Market prices are determined as usual at the intersection of demand and \nsupply, which in the Figure happens to be on the SCDMJI portion of the curve.  In contrast, in a \nmarket with auctions and a reserve price, the free allocation is reduced, and the supply curve \nis horizontal at the auction reserve price.  The intersection of demand and supply could \nproduce market prices above or below this reserve price, but the reserve price makes lower \nprices considerably less likely, particularly as the proportion of auctioned allowances \nincreases. \n                                                          \n13\n There is nothing wrong with very low carbon prices provided emission targets are being met and \nthose targets have been set optimally.  On the contrary, under those circumstances low prices should \nbe welcomed.  However, low prices are problematic if they reflect a suboptimally designed cap for a \ngiven commitment period, and imply much higher carbon prices in subsequent periods,  Fluctuating \nprices between periods does not promote \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility or dynamic efficiency, and mechanisms to \nsmooth prices between periods would contribute to rectifying this problem.  \n  Carbon markets in time \n15 \nFigure 3 Auction reserve prices may provide price support \n \nPEUA \nQEUA \nD \nQCap \nSJI\/CDM \n(a) market without auctions \nPEUA \nQEUA \nD \nSJI\/CDM \n(b) market with auctions \nQ* \nFree allocation \nAuction \nPMIN \nFree  \nallocation \nP* \nQ* \nSource: Hepburn et al. (2006) \nThere is no inherent reason why systems with and without auction reserve prices cannot be \nlinked together.  However, there are several relevant considerations.  First, the effectiveness \nof an auction reserve price in one system will be muted if it is linked to another system \nwithout a reserve price (or with substantial free allocation).  Second, if linked market prices \nfall below the reserve price, the government of the system with the reserve price is obliged to \ncurtail its supply of liquidity, thereby forfeiting the auction revenue to prop up prices in the \nlinked system. This effectively constitutes a transfer of wealth from the system with the \nreserve price to the system without it.  In other words, just as linking systems together \nrequires a similarity in ambition to minimise overall transfers from one system to another, the \ntwo systems would need to have similar (but not necessarily identical) auction reserve prices \nin order for linking to be successful. \n3.4 Allowance reserves \nJust as very low carbon prices may be problematic, so too are very high carbon prices.  Very \nlow prices in a given commitment period might suggest that the scheme design does not \nreflect the dynamically efficient path. Very high carbon prices in a given period may also \nreflect poor system design and dynamic inefficiency.  Where borrowing from a future \ncommitment period is not feasible, some other mechanism to smooth prices may be \ndesirable. \nEstablishing an \u201callowance reserve\u201d as contemplated by the Waxman-Markey draft bill \n(Section 726), could provide a \u201csoft\u201d mechanism by which to manage the risk of excessively \nhigh carbon prices.  The economics of an allowance reserve are not dissimilar to that of a \n  Carbon markets in time \n16 \n\u201csafety valve\u201d or \u201cprice ceiling\u201d (section 3.5), as shown in Figure 4.  With a \u201cprice ceiling\u201d (left \nfigure), the emissions cap creates the vertical component of the supply curve (marked \u201cf\u201d), \nwhile the safety valve creates the horizontal component (marked \u201cg\u201d), because additional \nallowances are supplied elastically onto the market at the fixed ceiling price.   \nFigure 4 Allowance reserves provide a limited form of cost containment \n \nSource: Murray et al. (2009) \nAn allowance reserve (right figure) is like a safety valve where a limit is placed on the number \nof allowances that will be issued if the safety valve is triggered.  This ensures that the system \ndelivers a defined level of emission reductions.  Murray et al. (2009) provide a clear \nexposition of the merits of an allowance reserve. \nThere are no economic impediments that prevent a system without an allowance reserve \nfrom linking to a system with an allowance reserve.  However, an allowance reserve, once \ntriggered, effectively transfers wealth from the system without the reserve to the system \nwith the reserve.  This is the converse of the wealth transfers potentially involved with an \nauction reserve price: withholding allowances from the market would transfer wealth from \nthe system with the auction reserve price to the system without.   \nIn practice, these wealth transfers may create political difficulties unless (i) the levels of \nambition of the two systems are set to allow for this possibility; or (ii) both systems introduce \nallowance reserves of roughly similar size.   \n3.5 Price ceilings and price floors \nIf commitment periods are short (section 3.1), banking and borrowing is limited or \nimpermissible (section 3.2), there is no auction price reserve (section 3.3) or allowance \nreserve (section 3.4), then prices will probably be highly volatile and subject to damaging \nspikes and\/or crashes.  The trading system will be unlikely to send appropriate long-term \n  Carbon markets in time \n17 \nsignals to private actors, who are therefore unlikely to seek to minimise their costs through \n\u201cwhen\u201d flexibility. \nIn circumstances such as these, consideration may be given to the establishment of a \u201cprice \ncollar\u201d, outside of which carbon prices would not be permitted to move.  The price collar \ncould be implemented by a \u201chybrid instrument\u201d which is a carefully tailored combination of \nprice and quantity instruments.14  Such a hybrid instrument would make the trading scheme \nmore \u201cprice like\u201d, which is likely to improve the economic efficiency of the system under \nuncertainty for a long-term stock problem such as climate change, as noted in the \nIntroduction.  Establishing a price ceiling and floor would provide significantly greater clarity \nto investors to deliver dynamic efficiency (in the form of optimal investment over longer \ntimeframes).  The price floor would guarantee a certain minimum return on investment in \nlow-carbon technologies, reducing the risk faced by innovating firms.  Additionally, the price \nceiling may enhance policy credibility.  Because it caps the costs of compliance, a ceiling \nreduces the risk of a policy reversal if abatement costs turn out to be injuriously high.   \nThe price ceiling could be established through an unlimited commitment from government \n(or the regulating body) to sell allowances onto the market at the price ceiling.15  A ceiling \nwould be achieved, however, at the cost of sacrificing compliance with the emissions cap.  In \naddition to compromising the environmental objective of the system, breaching the \nemissions cap might create difficulties when nations participating in the trading system are \nsubject to international emission reduction obligations.  The price floor might be established \nthrough an unlimited commitment from government (or the regulating body) to buy back \nallowances from the market at the price floor.  The floor would be achieved at the risk of \nimposing a liability on the public balance sheet.  If prices fall, the cost of buying allowances to \nsupport prices would be borne by the taxpayer, with particularly unappealing distributional \nconsequences if the allowances had been freely allocated to firms in the first place. \n                                                          \n14\n Hybrid instruments should be distinguished from the use of multiple instruments for the one \nproblem (see section 3.6).  Hybrid instruments have generated much interest in the climate change \ncontext, see e.g. Pizer (2002), Jacoby and Ellerman (2004) and Philibert (2009).  The classic paper is \nRoberts and Spence (1976). \n15\n Note that a penalty for non-compliance does not constitute a price ceiling unless it serves to release \nfirms from the obligation to comply. For instance, although the European emissions trading scheme \nimposes penalties for non-compliance for Phase I and II of \u20ac40\/tCO2 and \u20ac100\/tCO2 respectively, excess \nemissions must also be offset in the following compliance period (European Commission, 2003). \n  Carbon markets in time \n18 \nIn addition to these problems with price ceilings and floors, a key problem in adopting price \nceilings and floors is that they create additional complexity in linking of systems together, and \nmay even prevent linkage, reducing \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility. Ceilings and floors make linking \nsystems considerably more complex, because relevant regions and nation-states would need \nto agree upon the price ceiling and\/or price floor, in addition to a mechanism for \nimplementing them.  M\u00fcller, Michaelowa and Vrolijk (2001) express the view that achieving \nagreement on this would be a \u2018political nightmare\u2019. \n  Carbon markets in time \n19 \n4 Conclusion \nThere are compelling reasons to establish a long-term ambition for a global carbon market \nthat affords extensive flexibility both over time and across space.   \nIn terms of \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility, this paper draws are four key conclusions (see our companion \npaper, Fankhauser and Hepburn 2010, on \u201cwhere\u201d flexibility).  First, the trend towards longer \ncommitment periods is to be welcomed, as isolated three or five year periods are too short.  \nBeyond ten years, the trade-off between a committed, clear long-term price signal for the \nprivate sector, and the flexibility for policy (and emission targets) to respond to changes in \nthe science or abatement costs becomes more challenging.  Different approaches \u2013 such as \nthe Australian CPRS \u2013 may yield interesting insights in this respect.   \nSecond, banking both within and between commitment periods has several advantages, and \nit comes as no surprise that new systems are adopting liberal banking rules.   \nThird, borrowing carries significant drawbacks by way of moral hazard and adverse selection \nconcerns, and should only be permitted in a relatively limited manner, as indeed both the EU \nETS and the Waxman-Markey draft bill anticipate.  The limited differences in banking or \nborrowing rules that currently exist should not create major problems for linking systems.  \nFourth, other price management policies, such as allowance reserves, auction reserve prices \nor hard price ceilings and\/or floors, could be potential policy options to reduce price variance \nbetween commitment periods and increase dynamic efficiency and \u201cwhen\u201d flexibility.  \nHowever, these policies create obstacles that will make linking much more difficult. Given \nthat dynamic efficiency should be achievable in systems with long enough commitment \nperiods and appropriate banking and borrowing, these additional interventions may be seen \nas second-best policy alternatives to setting appropriate long-term targets in systems with \nbanking and limited borrowing.   \nSome of these design issues create conceptual difficulties and barriers to linking developed \ncountry systems. To some extent, there is a trade-off between \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d \nflexibility. Figure 1 above shows that the gains from spatial flexibility dominate those from \ntemporal flexibility, suggesting that policy makers should be willing to compromise on the \nlatter to secure the former. However, few temporal design features constitute  \ninsurmountable obstacles to linking developed country systems and advancing towards an \noverall long-run objective of establishing a global carbon market to reduce emissions.   \n  Carbon markets in time \n20 \nWhile there are factors discussed in this paper that counsel against full liberalisation of \nmarkets across time, taking advantage of \u201cwhen\u201d (and \u201cwhere\u201d) flexibility is critical to \nminimising the costs of mitigating emissions and responding to climate change.   \n  Carbon markets in time \n21 \nReferences \n \nAldy, J.E. and S.

This Appendix develops \nequivalent results for isoelastic demand and supply. \nIf demand for permits Qd from firms is isoelastic, it is given by:  \n (A1) \nwhere P is the permit price, \u03b5d is the demand elasticity and \u03b1d is a demand parameter.  The \nsupply of permits is determined by policy.  To allow for a general analysis, suppose the supply \nif permits is also isoelastic, and given by: \n (A2) \nwhere \u03b5s is the supply elasticity and \u03b3s is a parameter.  When supply is infinitely elastic, \u03b5s = \uf0a5, \npolicy is effectively a pure carbon tax.  When supply is inelastic, \u03b5s = 0, policy is a pure carbon \ntrading scheme.  Hybrid schemes allow for intermediate values.   \nThe clearing price in the model is given by: \n (A3) \nIf demand is uncertain and distributed normally such that: \n (A4) \nDenote , so that  is also normally distributed with \n.  It follows that  is lognormally distributed with \nvariance: \n (A5) \n (A6) \n  Carbon markets in time \n27 \nIn other words, as with linear demand and supply as in section 2.1, if a policy maker increases \nthe supply elasticity \u03b5s, for instance by moving from a carbon trading scheme, with a fix cap \nan inelastic supply of permits (\u03b5s = 0), to carbon taxes where supply is perfectly elastic (\u03b5s \n\uf0ae\u221e) will reduce price volatility. \n"}
