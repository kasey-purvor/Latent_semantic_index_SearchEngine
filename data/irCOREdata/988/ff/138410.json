This paper attempts to extend our understanding of\nthe issues.\nResearch limitations\nThe case studies and empirical research reported in this paper are specific to the\nclothing manufacturing and fashion industries and there would be benefit in\nextending the research into other sectors.\nKeywords : sourcing strategy; lean\/agile supply; supply chain taxonomy\nPaper type : Research paper\nIntroduction\nIt is now increasingly accepted that \u201cone size does not fit all\u201d when it comes to\ndesigning supply chain strategies to support a wide range of products with different\ncharacteristics sold in a diversity of markets (Shewchuck, 1998). It has long been\nrecognised that manufacturing strategy should be tailored to match the required\n\u2018order winning criteria\u2019 in the market place (Hill, 1985). However, this idea of\naligning the firm\u2019s operations with market place requirements has not always been\nextended to the wider supply chain. It can be argued that sourcing strategy,\noperations strategy and route-to-market need to be appropriate to specific\nproduct\/market conditions. In his seminal paper, Fisher (1997) drew on examples\nfrom a diverse range of consumer products, including food, fashion apparel and\nautomobiles, to illustrate why different supply chain solutions were required\ndepending upon whether products were \u2018functional\u2019 or \u2018innovative\u2019. Functional\nproducts tend to have stable and predictable demand with long lifecycles. Innovative\nproducts, in contrast, generally have unpredictable demand with short lifecycles.\nThis framework for supply chain design has been further developed by Christopher\n& Towill (2002) through the addition of replenishment lead-time as a critical driver\nof supply chain strategy.\nToday\u2019s market place is characterised by heightened global competition often against\na backdrop of an excess of supply over demand. In such situations there is a danger,\ndue to the continual pressure to take out costs that sub-optimal supply chain\ndecisions may be taken. For example, the introduction of \u2018just-in-time\u2019 delivery may\nreduce inventory in the factory but increase it at the supplier whilst also increasing\ntransport costs. What might look like a cost saving to one firm could mean increased\ncosts to the supply chain as a whole.\nTo avoid this type of sub-optimisation a holistic approach to supply chain\nmanagement (SCM) should be adopted. Since it is argued that \u201csupply chains\ncompete, not companies\u201d (Christopher, 1992) this implies the existence of a climate\nwherein holistic SCM is possible. Indeed an early move in this direction was\nproposed by Kraljic (1983) when arguing that purchasing needed to be seen in the\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n3\nperspective of the wider supply chain. By definition, supply chain management\ndemands a high level of \u2018joined-up thinking\u2019. In other words the selection of\nsuppliers, the location of facilities and the choice of distribution channels should all\nbe driven by the goal of enabling the marketing objectives of the organisation to be\nachieved. In the ideal world, supply chains would be designed from the \u2018customer\nbackwards\u2019 rather than the conventional approach which tends to be from the\n\u2018factory outwards\u2019. The temptation is to create supply chains which are more\nfocused upon \u2018efficiency\u2019 goals than \u2018effectiveness\u2019 goals. Thus the typical supply\nchain strategy is likely to be aimed at achieving a smooth flow at minimum cost\n(Harrington, 1991 and Scott and Westbrook, 1991). But how are the right supply\nchain decisions to be made which will enable the defined business and marketing\nstrategy to be enacted? How does the in-sourcing\/out-sourcing option fit into the\nholistic scheme of things? Is there a taxonomy which executive management may\nuse with confidence to establish not only the type, but the number of segmented\nsupply chain strategies required? This paper provides some possible answers to\nthese questions.\nTHE RISE OF GLOBAL SOURCING\nOver the last twenty years, geopolitical events moving in step with technological\ndevelopments and the deregulation of trade have made global sourcing and supply a\nreality. The old norms of \u2018local for local\u2019 manufacturing and sourcing have been\nswept away, apparently opening the door to the \u2018global village\u2019. The lure of cost\nsavings, largely due to fewer regulatory controls and significantly lower wages has\nprompted the mass-migration of manufacturing from the developed world to\nemergent economies in other regions. China has become the favoured destination for\nmanufacturing industry of all kinds. In fact its emergence as a force in international\ntrade, after decades of isolationism, has been one of the most remarkable phenomena\nof recent years. In the 1990s, its trade grew three times faster than that of the global\neconomy, and while world trade stagnated between 2000 and 2002, its imports and\nexports rose by 30% (WTO 2003).\nThe paradox is that supposedly low-cost off-shore sourcing strategies can end up as\nhigh-cost supply chain outcomes. The reasons behind this are often complex, but\nsome seemingly obvious factors are often overlooked. First there are higher\ntransport costs, due in part to the greater distances covered. Geopolitics is a factor\nhere too. East-West trade has benefited for many years from relatively low transport\ncosts, underpinned by stable oil prices. The uncertainty in oil markets before and\nafter the US-led invastion of Iraq in 2003, raised questions about the longer-term\nviability of globe-spanning supply chains and the underlying assumptions of\nprevailing purchasing practices (New 2003). With more and more manufacturers\nheading for China, shipping prices have risen sharply and seasonal shortages in\nfreight capacity have emerged (Johnson 2001).\nThe second, and less obvious cost driver is the extension in lead-times, resulting\nfrom distance and the almost inevitable complications involved in coordinating\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n4\nshipments from far-off suppliers, through forwarders, shippers, customs and delivery\nnetworks. Often this requires the ability to manage across diverse cultural, legal and\nregulatory environments.\nFor many so-called \u2018commodity\u2019 items the lower manufacturing costs may well\noutweigh the higher costs of transport and the longer lead times. For other categories\nof products, particularly those identified by Fisher (1997) as innovative, this may not\nbe the case. Electronics manufacturer Sony found this to be so with its high-tech\ncamcorders and digital cameras. In 2002 it moved production of both from China to\nJapan. The reason for Sony\u2019s decision was supply chain cost-related (Bin 2003).\nChina had proved to be an excellent location for many of Sony\u2019s less innovative\ncompetitors who focussed on the forecast-driven, efficient production of products\nbased on proven technologies. But for its leading edge products, Sony found that\nChina\u2019s manufacturing base lacked critical \u2018market mediation\u2019 capabilities \u2013 i.e.the\ntechnological expertise, benefits of proximity and the supply chain flexibility to cope\nwith the demands of high-margin, high-risk new product introductions\nCompanies that choose to differentiate themselves through innovation must tread the\nfine line between the dangers of over-optimistic forecasting with the attendant risks\nof remaindered stock, and the risks of wasted opportunity arising from the inability\nto supply quickly enough when a winning product is produced. To survive they must\nbe able to minimise the risk from failed products and maximise the benefits of\nsuccessful innovations, before margins fall as competitors follow with cheaper, less\nrisky, \u2018me-too\u2019 offers. Sony had managed the inherent risks of innovative new\nproduct introductions through close collaboration between itself and its suppliers\nthroughout the new product development process. The networks of suppliers had the\ncapabilities to respond very rapidly to consumer demand should the product prove to\nbe successful in the market. Sony relocated its leading edge product production from\nChina because its efficient low-cost manufacturers lacked these essential capabilities,\nbut the skills were well-established and available \u2013 at a cost - in Japan. Added to this\nwas the fact that while demand for consumer electronics is strong in China, most of\nthe customers for the high margin innovative products are in the more developed\nmarkets of the US, Western Europe and Japan. Consequently, Japan provided a\nbetter base in terms of user market proximity, hence Sony\u2019s decision to relocate.\nThe pattern of trade and demand affecting other categories of consumer products is\nsimilar to that of consumer electronics. In 2002, the value of clothing exports\nworldwide reached $200 billion, accounting for around 3.2% of all merchandise\nexports by value. Again the US, Western Europe and Japan are the main importers\naccounting for around 80% of all clothing imports. Amongst the major suppliers to\nthe EU were China, Turkey and Romania, each expanded their shipments to the EU\nby between 15% and 22% in 2002. China also increased its imports to the US and\ncontinued to supply more than three quarters of clothing imported to Japan (WTO\n2003). The challenge to business organisations that seek to improve their\ncompetitiveness in this sector too is to find the supply chain solution that best fits the\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n5\ndemands of the market place. In this paper we will examine in more detail the\ncircumstances where global sourcing is advantageous, and situations where the\nimperative is for shorter, more responsive supply chains.\nPipeline lead-times\nIn many markets, time has become a competitive variable. Not just time-to-market\nfor new product introductions but time-to-respond in terms of being able to meet the\nneeds of time-sensitive customers. Nowhere is this more true than in the apparel\nindustry where seasons can be short and demand unpredictable. Paradoxically in this\nindustry lead-times have if anything lengthened over the last decade or so. This is\nprimarily the result of global sourcing as retailers have sought out low cost sources\nof supply. The risk that is incurred through lengthened lead-times can be\nconsiderable. If decisions on style, colour and quantity have to be taken many\nmonths ahead of the season then the greater is the chance of error in the forecast. As\na rule of thumb (Blackburn, 1991) forecast errors in the fashion industry related to\nthe forecast time horizon are as follows:-\n\uf0a7 Start of season \uf0b1 10%\n\uf0a7 Minus 16 weeks \uf0b1 20%\n\uf0a7 Minus 26 weeks \uf0b1 40%\nNor is the situation any better in consumer electronics (Watson, 1993) where the\nequivalent rule of thumb is:\n\uf0a7 Forecast 1 month ahead \uf0b1 5%\n\uf0a7 Forecast 2 months ahead \uf0b1 20%\n\uf0a7 Forecast 3 months ahead \uf0b1 50%\nIt has been suggested (Lowson, 2001) that for the UK garment retail industry the\nmove to offshore sourcing can quadruple the time from order to delivery in some\ncases thus dramatically increasing supply chain risk.\nWhilst the purchase cost of the garment is clearly significantly less if sourced from,\nsay, the Far East this comes at the expense of lack of flexibility to both order mix and\nvolume change, plus long lead times, as Table 1 shows (Christopher and Towill,\n2002). Here we have computed integrated responsiveness metrics from survey data\nfrom the clothing industry obtained by Lowson (2001). The Table provides a simple\nmethod of ranking the flexibility of these various sources. Thus the European\nvendors perform very much better responding to pre-season changes compared to\nAsia. This advantage also carries over into flexibility of supply after the season has\nstarted. Additionally, if the lead times are compared with the previously quoted\nforecast errors (say 16 weeks out) then it is clear that matching supply with demand\nis greatly affected by the long lead times associated with some offshore sources. So\na business operating in such a scenario and supplied via a single delivery pipeline\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n6\ncan expect to have many stock-outs alternating with huge surpluses, and seasonal\nsales at knock down prices. All these factors heavily erode profit margins.\nTable 1 - Estimate of Vendor Responsiveness to Volume Change and Mix Change According\nto Geographic Region\n(Source: Authors based on European Survey results Undertaken by Lowson, 2001)\nComputed Response Metric (Higher is Better)\nBefore Start of\nSeason\nAfter Start of Season\nSourcing\nRegion\nOrder-to-\nDelivery\nLead Time\n(Weeks)\nVolume\nChange\nOrder\nMix\nVolume\nChange\nOrder\nMix\nNorth America 35 .34 .23 .28 .26\nEuropean 12 .57 .48 .30 .15\nNon-EU 21 .42 .37 .49 .46\nCentral\nAmerica\n38 .16 .11 .25 .17\nAsia 55 .19 .17 .15 .06\nAfrica 39 .29 .24 .21 .21\nOther 34 .40 .46 .39 .35\nLean and Agile Supply Chains\nOne of the more interesting debates in recent years concerning supply chain strategy\nhas centred around the relative merits of \u2018lean\u2019 and \u2018agile\u2019 philosophies. The idea of\n\u2018lean thinking\u2019 has been expounded by Womack and Jones (1996) amongst others.\nThe focus of lean thinking has been on the reduction or elimination of waste (muda).\nThe origins of the lean approach can be traced to the Toyota Production System\n(TPS) with its focus on the efficient use of resources through level scheduling (Ohno,\n1988). It has been suggested (Christopher, 2000) that lean concepts work well where\ndemand is relatively stable and hence predictable and where variety is low.\nConversely in those contexts where demand is volatile and the customer requirement\nfor variety is high, a different approach is called for.\nThis is the concept of \u2018agility\u2019. Agility is concerned primarily with responsiveness.\nIt is about the ability to match supply and demand in turbulent and unpredictable\nmarkets. In essence it is about being demand-driven rather than forecast-driven.\nAgility is a business-wide capability that embraces organisational structures, logistics\nprocesses and, in particular, mind-sets. A key characteristic of an agile organisation\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n7\nis flexibility. Indeed, the origins of agility as a business concept lie in flexible\nmanufacturing systems (FMS). Later this idea of manufacturing flexibility was\nextended into the wider business context (Nagel & Dove, 1991) and the concept of\nagility as a supply chain philosophy was born.\nIn reality the two approaches can complement each other, and in many cases there is\na requirement for a \u201chybrid\u201d lean\/agile strategy to be adopted, (Christopher and\nTowill, 2000). Hence it is our contention that the issue is not \u201cLean versus Agile\u201d\nrather it is the judicious selection and integration of appropriate aspects of these\nparadigms appropriate to the particular supply chain strategy. In some cases the two\nideas of lean and agile can be brought together as a hybrid \u2018leagile\u2019 solution (Naylor\net.al. 1999)\nOne such \u2018hybrid\u2019 solution is to utilise lean principles when designing supply chains\nfor predictable standard products and agile principles for unpredictable or \u2018special\u2019\nproducts. Or again it may be that total demand for a product can be separated as\n\u2018base\u2019 and \u2018surge\u2019 demand. Base demand is more predictable and less risky so lean\nprinciples can be applied, using agile approaches to cope with surge demand. An\nexample of this separation of base and surge demand is the multiple pipeline solution\nimplemented by the Griffin Manufacturing Co. (Stratton and Warburton, 2001).\nTheir approach is shown in Table 2, and seeks an optimal blend of in-sourcing and\nout-sourcing in meeting both baseline and surge demands. In 1999 the resulting\nbalance worked out at 80% production in Honduras, and 20% production in the USA.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n8\nTable 2 - Pragmatic Multiple Pipeline Solution Adopted by Griffin Manufacturing Co.\n(Source: Authors Based on Stratton and Warburton, 2001)\nPipeline CharacteristicsGriffin\nManufacturing\nPragmatic Solution\nPipeline\nPurpose\nSupplier Product Demand Lead\nTime\nHigh Volume\nLean Pipeline\nBaseline\nDemand\nOut-Sourced Standard Stable Long\nTop-Up\nAgile Pipeline\nSurge\nDemand\nIn-House Standard Volatile Short\nInnovative Goods\nAgile Pipeline\nSurge\nDemand\nIn-House Special Volatile Short\nIt is also likely that products may well require different kinds of pipeline according\nto their position within the product life cycle (Christopher and Towill, 2000).\nSo pipelines should not be fixed for all times. What is needed is a continuous\nassessment of the product range and market characteristics so that changing scenarios\nmay be identified. Against these product\/market characteristics will be a number of\nalternative options for pipeline design, heavily dependent upon supply lead times.\nSo it is not surprising that lead times form a major part of our supply chain\ntaxonomy.\nA Taxonomy for Pipeline Selection\nA number of classification schemes have been proposed in the literature to guide the\nchoice of supply chain strategy (e.g. Fisher, 1997, Childerhouse, 2002). Because of\nthe critical impact that replenishment lead-times have on responsiveness to demand\nand because, as we have observed, globalisation is tending to extend those lead-\ntimes, we believe that lead-time must be included in any useful taxonomy. Thus we\nare suggesting a simple three-dimensional classification appropriate for global supply\nchains. The dimensions and their binary gradations are:-\n\uf0a7 Products (standard or special)\n\uf0a7 Demand (stable or volatile)\n\uf0a7 Replenishment lead-times (short or long)\nHence there will be eight (2x2x2) theoretical pipeline types. In practice some of\nthese are either unlikely to be encountered or are non-viable situations.\nWhilst the characterisation of products as either \u2018special\u2019 or standard\u2019 may be an\nover-simplification it is a useful high-level distinction. What makes a product\n\u2018special\u2019 in our sense is probably that it is either low volume with erratic demand or\nit is a product with a probable short life cycle or, possibly, a product with a high level\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n9\nof customisation. \u2018Standard\u2019 products on the other hand will tend to be more stable\nin demand with longer life cycles with no, or limited, customisation.\nBecause predictability and product type will tend to be related, i.e. standard products\nwill be more predictable (at least over longer periods), it is possible to simplify the\ntaxonomy into just two dimensions : predictability and replenishment lead-times.\nFigure 1 summarises the resulting 2x2 matrix and Table 3 defines the four suggested\npipeline solutions that emerge from the classification.\nLong\nLead\nTime\nSu\npp\nly\nC\nha\nra\nct\ner\nis\nti\ncs\nShort\nLead\nTime\nPredictable Unpredictable\nDemand Characteristics\nFigure 1 - How Demand\/Supply Characteristics Determine Pipeline Selection Strategy\n(Source: Authors)\nOn the horizontal axis of Fig. 1 we show the demand characteristics in terms of\n\u2018predictability\u2019. This is likely to be determined by the variability of demand, hence\nmeasures such as the Coefficient of Variation (\uf073\/ x ) could be used to position\nproducts on that axis. The vertical axis reflects the replenishment lead times for the\nsame product. Effectively this is measuring the time it would take the system to\nrespond to an increase in demand if materials etc. had to be sourced or manufactured.\nIf this elapsed time is measured in months rather than days then that product could be\nregarded as having a long re-supply lead time.\nLEAN\nPLAN AND\nEXECUTE\nLEAN\nCONTINUOUS\nREPLENISHMENT\nAGILE\nQUICK\nRESPONSE\nLEAGILE\nPOSTPONEMENT\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n10\nTable 3 \u2013 Relating Pipeline Types to Supply\/Demand Characteristics\n(Source: Authors)\nSupply Demand Characteristics Resulting Pipelines\n\uf0b7 Short Lead Time + Predictable\nDemand\n\uf0b7 Lean Continuous Replenishment\n\uf0b7 Short Lead Time + Unpredictable\nDemand\n\uf0b7 Agile Quick Response\n\uf0b7 Long Lead Time + Predictable\nDemand\n\uf0b7 Lean, Planning and Execution\n\uf0b7 Long Lead Time + Unpredictable\nDemand\n\uf0b7 Leagile Production\/ Logistics\nPostponement\nAs outlined above, the matrix suggests that there might be four possible generic\nsupply chain strategies. In those situations where demand is predictable and\nreplenishment lead-times are short then a \u2018continuous replenishment\u2019 strategy may\nbe appropriate. This is how companies like Procter & Gamble manage their supply\nchain for volume products to Wal-Mart in the USA. Making use of point-of-sale\ndata they can rapidly replenish individual stores through a process of Vendor\nManaged Inventory (VMI).\nAt the other extreme (unpredictable demand and long lead-times) the ideal solution is\nto carry strategic inventory in some generic form and assemble\/configure\/distribute\nas required when actual demand is encountered. This is the classic \u2018postponement\u2019\nconcept. Hewlett Packard follow this strategy for their range of DeskJet printers.\nThey build a semi-finished product at their central facilities in North America and\nthen ship it to four regional centres around the world which are run for them by third-\nparty logistics service providers. At these centres the product is finally configured\nand delivered when actual customer orders are received.\nIf lead-times are long but demand is predictable, then there is opportunity for the\npursuit of \u2018lean\u2019 type strategies, e.g. make or source ahead of demand in the most\nefficient way. An example is provided by the UK retailer Woolworths. Woolworths\nsell a million plastic Christmas trees each year. They source these mainly from\nChina and have to place their order over six months ahead of the season. However,\nthey see little risk in this strategy given their prior experience of demand for the\nproduct.\nFinally, when demand is unpredictable but lead-times are short, then agile solutions\nwill be required based upon rapid response. A good example of agility is the case of\nZara, the Spanish fashion garment manufacturer and retailer. They can move\nproducts into their stores across Europe in as little as three to four weeks after they\nhave been designed. They do this by using cross-functional teams to manage the\nend-to-end process and by using numerous small workshops in Spain and Portugal to\ngive them a high level of flexibility.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n11\nWithin each cell of the matrix the tactics adopted may also be influenced by whether\nthe product is \u2018standard\u2019 or \u2018special\u2019. For example, in the \u2018postponement\u2019 cell of\nFigure 1, for a special product we may postpone manufacture, but for a standard\nproduct it may be better to postpone distribution (Pagh and Cooper, 1998).\nFinally, to underline the importance of choosing the right supply chain strategy\ndepending upon the supply and demand characteristics encountered, we briefly\ndescribe the dilemma facing the British retailer, Marks & Spencer. This case study\nsuggests that the company may have initially failed to recognise the need to adopt\ndifferent supply chain strategies for their \u2018special\u2019, more fashion-oriented products,\nand their \u2018standard\u2019, stable demand items.\nSELECTING GLOBAL PIPELINES \u2013 AN APPAREL INDUSTRY CASE\nSTUDY\nMarks & Spencer (M&S), a major British retailer, had long been a textbook example\nof a successful extended enterprise. For decades it had been an industry leader in\ncollaborative working with its network of dedicated local suppliers. In the 1990s it\nabandoned its UK sourcing strategy, first by requiring its established suppliers to\nrelocate production overseas to low cost manufacturing centres, then to more open\nsourcing policies. This change in strategy was forced upon it by competitive\npressures, particularly the continuing downward pressure on price. To maintain\nprofitability, M&S were forced to seek a step change in cost-reduction.\nThe potential for cost reduction through this means was dramatic, at least on paper.\nAccording to the British Apparel and Textile Confederation, the average hourly\nlabour cost for clothing manufacturers in the UK in 2000 was $9.50 compared to\n$1.20 an hour in Morocco and less than 50 cents an hour in China, Pakistan and\nIndonesia. M&S soon discovered that this simplistic calculation failed to take into\naccount the hidden costs of overseas sourcing, particularly the risks relating to\nsignificantly extended replenishment lead-times. It overlooked the need to secure\ntransport capacity and textile import quotas ahead of season, discovering too late that\nit lacked the essential logistics know-how needed to support its new sourcing\nstrategy.\nWhereas M&S\u2019s dedicated domestic suppliers had been able to re-supply relatively\nrapidly, with overseas sourcing orders typically had to be placed many months ahead\nof requirement. Inevitably, reliance on forecasts increased. Thus buyers had to\nforecast styles, colours and volumes well ahead of the season. If these forecasts were\nwrong \u2013 and they often were \u2013 then the result was either over-stocking or a stock-out.\nEither way, this had a negative impact on profitability. Indeed one of the major\ncauses of the M&S profit slump in the late 1990s was the lack of interest shown by\nconsumers in the M&S clothing range where the buyers had seriously misjudged\nfashion trends.\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n12\nPart of the problem for M&S was that their definition of cost was too narrow, i.e. the\npurchase cost rather than the total cost of ownership. In the event, what was intended\nto be a low cost supply chain solution turned out to be high cost, not least because\nthey had adopted a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 supply chain strategy for their clothing products.\nIt could be argued that the strategy would have been, and indeed is appropriate for\nhigh volume \u2018standard\u2019 items, such as men\u2019s shirts and socks, but not for\n\u2018innovative\u2019 or \u2018special\u2019 ranges such as M&S\u2019s exclusive short-life cycle, designer-\nled, high margin Autograph range.\nIt is now acknowledged amongst the top management team at M&S that a much\nmore differentiated supply chain strategy for garments is essential. The new supply\nchain strategy was first outlined in M&S\u2019s Interim Report of September 2002 when\nthe Chairman and Chief Executive wrote:-\n\u201cLack of flexibility has been the major weakness within our supply chain. In the\npast, we bought stock to cover 100% of budgeted sales well in advance of the season.\nWe have now discontinued this practice. For Spring 2001, while 50% of\nmerchandise is core and therefore bought with long lead-times, we will commit to\napproximately 40% of merchandise much closer to the season, and a further 10%\nwill be bought in the season itself in response to emerging fashion trends.\u201d\nDegree of predictability of demand and the length of the season are factored in to\nsourcing decisions. These issues increasingly determine where products should be\nsourced, how they should be transported and whether it is a one-off buy or a\ncontinuing supply.\nIn spring 2004, 80% of clothing sourced by M&S was manufactured overseas,\nthough it retains close relationships with its leading suppliers, with its top 15\nsuppliers accounting for 92% of its clothing business. Many of these are UK-owned\ncompanies operating overseas, in up and coming Asian countries such as Cambodia\nas well as some of the new EU Accession States. \u2018Journey time\u2019 has become a\nprincipal deciding factor in product sourcing decisions. The emphasis is on quick\nresponse for lines where demand is difficult to predict. These items are\nmanufactured in locations with a journey time of less than four days. Standard items,\nfor which demand is expected to be predictable and continuous, continue to be\nsourced from low cost centres around the globe.\nM&S is acknowledged to be getting better at managing sourcing and replenishment\nissues, though it continues to struggle to align its standard product offer with the\nevolving tastes in the market (Warner 2004). The problem emphasises the point that\na responsive supply chain can minimise the risks associated with unappealing\nproducts, but cannot overcome poor design and buying decisions which fail to\nintroduce attractive products in the first place.\nConclusions\nInternational Journal of Logistics Management, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2006, pp 277-287\n13\nAs global sourcing and offshore manufacturing dramatically alter the landscape of\nbusiness activity, there needs to be a similar change in the way in which supply chain\nstrategies are determined. Whilst downward pressure on price will continue to be a\nreal issue in deflationary market conditions, it also has to be recognised that agility\nand responsiveness are increasingly fundamental to competitive success.\nIn this paper we have proposed a taxonomy to guide the selection of appropriate\nglobal supply chain strategies. The key dimensions of this taxonomy are\nreplenishment lead-times and predictability\/variability of demand. Whilst previous\ntaxonomies have tended to focus on the nature of the product and its life cycle, we\nsuggest that these can be further enriched by the use of lead-time and demand\nvariability measures.\nThe challenge to today\u2019s global business is firstly to identify the appropriate supply\nchain solutions to meet the different needs of the different product\/market\ncharacteristics and then secondly to manage what are likely to be multiple supply\nchains.\nREFERENCES\nBin, J.
