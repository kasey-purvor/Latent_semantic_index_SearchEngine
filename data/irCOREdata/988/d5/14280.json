In the specific context of the United Kingdom, lifelong\nlearning is about converting people to a culture of learning in order that the nation can produce\ncreative, enterprising scholars (Blunkett, 1998). In both contexts, it is considered that learning\nneeds to be a lifelong commitment, in order that individuals can fulfil their potential and\nimprove themselves.\nIt is generally accepted that learning technologies can increase access to education through\nflexible delivery and innovative uses of open and distance learning (Porritt, 1997; Lovie,\nMcLean and Newlands, 1998). An examination of learning technology literature reveals strong\nconsensus that the kind of learning to which people should be converted is more than just\n61\nJane Seale Learning technologies and the lifelong learner: armament or disarmament?\nknowledge acquisition. Huge emphasis is placed on critical thinking and reflection. For\nexample, Hammond and Trip (1998) argue:\nThe computer is starting to be used not just as a delivery mechanism or surrogate calculator,\nbut to encourage the learner to ask questions, explore and form active hypotheses, in short\nas a cognitive tool for learning, an augmenter of intelligent study, (p. 88)\nWhile McLoughlin and Oliver (1998) see learning as a social, collaborative and conversational\nexperience and therefore argue that:\nThe conversation requires reciprocity and mutual understanding and this is achieved\nthrough talk, discussion, and negotiation. Computer assisted learning can support inter-\naction, dialogue, reflection and conversation if learning tasks are structured appropriately.\n(P-13)\nIn considering the kind of learning that learning technologies should promote, the language\nused in the literature conjures up images of a 'battle' to 'equip' learners. For example Steeples,\nUnsworth, Bryson, Goodyear, Riding, Fowell, Levey and Duffy (1996) talk of how discursive\ntechnologies can be used to 'challenge conventional, didactic modes of education' (p. 78).\nHammond and Tripp (1992) use the metaphor of a 'Trojan Horse' to describe how the computer\nis starting to be used in psychology education, while Grabinger, Dunlap and Duffield (1997)\ntalk of how learners need to be involved in a 'continual process of retooling their knowledge\nand skill base' (p. 5). The use of learning technologies may equip learners in a positive way,\nsuch as that described by Grabinger et al. Alternatively, the use of learning technologies may\nequip learners in a negative way. For example, Carswell (1998) talks of how students who are\nill-prepared to use the World Wide Web may be burdened with the 'extra cognitive load of\ndeveloping new strategies for accessing Internet-based material' (p. 77). In other words, instead\nof being armed and well-prepared for learning, students who use learning technologies may be\ndisarmed and denied a rich learning experience.\nIn this paper, two case examples of the use of learning technologies with university students\nwill be described. The battle imagery highlighted in the literature will be utilized in order to\ndevelop the argument that the way learning technologies are used may serve to either arm or\ndisarm learners.\nCase example I: email discussion list\nAn email discussion list was set up by the author to support a first-year module of behavioural\nsciences being taught in an Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy degree course at\nSouthampton University. In order to promote and instigate discussion, case studies, topical\nnews items, questions and summaries of arguments were posted. In order to inform discussion\nand enable students to place the issues in a context, lecture notes {PowerPoint slides) and\nreference lists were also posted. There was an implicit assumption that the students would\nreflect on the information contained in the lecture notes and use these reflections to contribute\nto a group discussion. This assumption reflects a common portrayal of email as an ideal means\nof providing opportunities for group discussion, tutor-student interaction and collaborative\nworking (McAteer, Tolmie, Duffy, and Corbett, 1997).\nThe email list was evaluated through the use of both a paper-based and email-based\nquestionnaire. The paper-based questionnaire was distributed amongst all 130 first-year\n62\nAu-J Vb\/ume 7 Number I\nstudents in December 1997 and invited comments on teaching and learning support, including\nthe email list There was a 36 per cent response rate for this questionnaire. The email-based\nquestionnaire included open questions about students' reasons for using the list, and more\nclosed questions asking them to rate the learning experiences offered by the list from 1 (most\nvaluable) to 5 (least valuable). There was a 15 per cent response rate for this questionnaire.\nFinally, usage statistics were collated from Majordomo, in order to assess numbers of\nsubscriptions and postings to the list.\nCase example 2: the CAT Microcosm application\nComputer Applications in Therapy (CAT) is a Microcosm application, designed by the author to\nsupport a third-year option offered within the School of Occupational Therapy and\nPhysiotherapy at Southampton University (Seale, 1997). The basic design of the package is that\nstudents first choose one patient\/client history and then browse through the resource informa-\ntion in order to find out as much as they can about whether or not the client in the case history\nwould benefit from using a computer. Students can enter and browse through the resource\ninformation at any level and in any order they wish. They can follow pre-determined links or\ncreate their own search strategies. The final outcome is that students can use the material in the\nresource information to write a report on whether and how they would use a computer with their\nchosen clients. The application uses case studies to encourage students to apply the knowledge\nthey gained from the package and to think carefully about when and how they would\nuse computers with clients. Case studies are a popular method for facilitating self-directed\nlearning, particularly when using CAL. For example Kahn and Yip (1996), in considering the\npedagogic principles of case-based CAL, argue for case-based reasoning (CBR) whereby a set\nof examples or cases is employed in a structured network. A CBR network therefore offers\nstudents opportunities to use previous examples or cases to solve fresh problems. The student is\nhelped to acquire an expert model through free or structured browsing.\nIn order to evaluate the usefulness of the CAT Microcosm application a small evaluation study\nwas conducted in February 1997. Seven lecturers and eight third-year students were offered a\n90-minute workshop in which the package was explained and demonstrated with opportunity\nfor 'unstructured hands-on play'. At the end of the workshop they were asked to complete an\nevaluation questionnaire that contained a number of statements regarding the presentation,\ncontent and educational use of CAT. Respondents were asked to state whether they strongly\nagreed (score of 5) or strongly disagreed (score of 1) with each statement. In addition to\nanswering the opinion questions, the students were asked to list the advantages and dis-\nadvantages of using the application.\nEvidence for armament and disarmament\nThe results from the evaluations of the email list and the CAT Microcosm application provide\nsome evidence that students could potentially be both armed and disarmed by their use of these\nlearning technologies. This evidence will now be presented in more detail.\nArmed by information\nThe data from the evaluation of the email discussion list revealed strong evidence that students\nhighly valued the opportunity to obtain information in the form of lecture notes. For example,\n_\nJane Seole Learning technologies and the lifelong learner: armament or disarmament?\nRanking Positions Summary of student rankings\nI st Theory lecture notes 9 out of 11 of respondents gave a rank of I ( Mean= 154)\n2nd: Applied lecture notes 8 out of 11 of respondents gave a rank of 2 (Mean=Z09)\n3rd: Reference lists 6 out of 11 of respondents gave a rank of 3 (Mean=3.18)\n4th: Tutor-posted questions 3 out of 11 of respondents gave a rank of 4 (Mean =4.09)\n5th: Student responses to questions 6 out of 11 of respondents gave a rank of 5 (Mean=5.45)\n6th: Student-posted questions 6 out of 11 of respondents gave a rank of 6 (Mean=6.09)\nTable I: Student rankings of the facilities offered by the email discussion list in terms of being useful to\nlearning\nthe students ranked the learning experience offered by the lecture notes and reference lists\nhigher than they ranked the posted discussion questions and their responses (see Table 1).\nInterestingly, the theory notes were ranked above the applied notes, and tutor-posted questions\nwere ranked higher than student-posted questions. Some of the comments made by the students\nmay help to further our understanding of why the information obtained from the lecture notes\nwas valued so highly (see Table 2).\nInformation Reinforced personal notes from lecture. Allows you to pay more attention in class. You\nknow there is always a back up if you dont understand things. Enabled me not to worry\nabout writing every single word down. I looked up the lecture notes to compensate for my\nnotes, which were never comprehensive.\nConfidence I sometimes feel I may lack confidence in answering some topics. I don't feel I have enough\nknowledge base yet to answer the questions. Being unsure of some of the subject areas\nand not having experience of relevant areas inhibited me. I didn't understand some of the\nquestions.\nTable 2: Example evaluation comments for the email discussion list\nDisarmed by a low valuation of discussion\nThe information in Table 1 indicates that students using the email discussion list valued\nobtaining information above discussing the information. Usage statistics from Majordomo\nsupport this. So for example, statistics concerning the response to discussion questions revealed\nvery poor response and contribution levels. Of the eight debate issues posted to the list by the\ntutor, five failed to gain a single response by the students. Of the three issues that elicited a\nresponse, only two or three students responded.\nArmed with an opportunity to apply knowledge\nThe data from the evaluation of the CAT Microcosm application revealed evidence that a major\nadvantage of using the application was the ability to obtain information that can be applied to\nother learning situations such as modules and placements (see Table 3). Interestingly, the\nstudents have listed more opportunities for applying knowledge than the lecturers.\nDisarmed by a lack of confidence\nIn trying to understand why the discussion element of the email list was not used or valued, the\nevidence suggests that some students appear to have been disarmed by a lack of confidence in\n64\nALT-J Volume 7 Number I\nThird-year Students Lecturers\nApplied Knowledge Useful for other modules\nUseful for placements\nCan be used in assignments\nUseful for multi-disciplinary teaching\nUseful for placement preparation\nSelf-directed learning Learn in own time and learn Students still need to do their own research\nat own pace Would be disappointed if students did not\nEncourage self-directed study look further\nMakes learning interesting Weaker students may not look further\nSaves you wading through books Some students may need to discuss their\nfindings with others\nStudents'thinking may be limited by the\nlinking\nTable 3: Example comments regarding the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using the CAT\nMicrocosm application\ntheir individual knowledge and experience. This perhaps suggests that the discussion excluded\nthose who for whatever reason did not feel 'qualified' to join in the discussion (see Table 3).\nDisarmed by restrictions on self-directed learning\nFor the CAT Microcosm application, analysis of responses to open questions revealed\ndisagreements between students and lecturers regarding self-directed learning. Students felt the\npackage would encourage self-directed learning because users can learn in their own time and\npace. While lecturers expressed concern that students' thinking may be limited by the linking\nwithin the package and some students might not look further than the CAT resource base and\nthus may not be as self-directed as they perhaps could be (see Table 3).\nDiscussion\nFor the email discussion list the results reveal that a lack of confidence and a low valuation of\nthe discussion could disarm users. Possible reasons why students felt unconfident may relate to\nthe way the email list was set up. For example, the membership of the group was quite large\n(over 70) and there was no anonymity when posting messages to the list. These two things\ncombined may have served to exclude those students who were afraid of exhibiting their\n'ignorance' in such a public arena. These problems could be solved with a bit more creative\nthinking on behalf of the list owner.\nThe apparent low valuation of the email discussion list may be explained by examining the role\nof the list owner. Both Laurillard (1993) and McLoughlin and Oliver (1998) consider that the\ntutor plays a pivotal role in encouraging conversation and reflection. They suggest strategies for\nachieving such a role that include clarifying expectations, promoting verbal expressions of\ndifferent perspectives and encouraging alternative solutions or approaches. Perhaps the owner\nof the email discussion list failed to engage her students in an open dialogue about the\nobjectives for using the email list and therefore there was no negotiation about the process or\ngoals of learning.\nFor the CAT Microcosm application the results reveal that users may be disarmed by a\nperceived restriction that the application places on self-directed learning. A possible reason why\n65\nJane Seo\/e Learning technologies and the lifelong learner: armament or disarmament?\nthe application may be seen to place restrictions on self-directed learning is the fact that it is a\nself-contained resource base. Given that students are expected to search the resource base to\nfind out more information about their chosen case study they may be given the impression that\nall the answers are held within the resource base. If all the answers were held within such an\nexpert system there would seem to be no reason to direct learning to other sources of\ninformation. Solutions to this disarmament problem may involve revisiting the design of the\nCAT application and perhaps changing the links within the application so that students are\nencouraged to take paths out of the self-contained resource base. Alternatively, the author of the\npackage may need to make explicit to the students her learning goals and so for example 'sell'\nthe package as the springboard to other sources of knowledge.\nImplications for lifelong learning\nIn the introduction an argument was made that focused on the idea that learning technologies\ncan play a role in converting learners to a culture of critical thinking and reflection as opposed\nto a culture of knowledge acquisition. The two case examples described in this paper have\nserved to illustrate how learning technologies can help students to acquire information and\nknowledge. However, it is debatable whether the use of these learning technologies has helped\nto produce lifelong learners that are capable of critical thinking and reflection. The way these\ntechnologies were used means that neither did particularly well in promoting such skills as\ndiscussion or self-directed learning. These skills would seem to be essential if students are to\nfulfil their potential and improve themselves.\nThe two case studies described in this paper are preliminary investigations, which gathered\ninformation from only a small number of students. Whilst the results from the two case studies\nsuggest that the use of learning technologies may place obstacles in the way of lifelong\nlearning, more detailed work needs to be undertaken in order to test the conclusion drawn here\nthat learners will be disarmed unless educators are creative in their design and use of learning\ntechnologies and enterprising in how they negotiate and promote the objectives for using\nlearning technologies with students.\nReferences\nBlunkett, D.
