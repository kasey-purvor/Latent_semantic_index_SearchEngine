INTRODUCTION\nLiquid crystal polymers \u0001LCPs\u0002 may be classified ac-\ncording to the location of mesogenic groups within the poly-\nmer structure.1 Polymers with rigid mesogenic groups incor-\nporated within the backbone are termed main chain liquid\ncrystal polymers \u0001MCLCPs\u0002. These were the first type of\nliquid crystal polymers to be synthesized and include a range\nof nematogenic and smectogenic polymers, which have been\nknown for many years.2 Most notably, MCLCPs have found\nuses in the production of high strength fibers. Side chain\nliquid crystal polymers \u0001SCLCPs\u0002 are formed when me-\nsogenic units are attached to the polymer backbone as pen-\ndant groups. Here the tendency for the backbone to adopt a\nrandom coil conformation competes with the mesogenic\npreference for orientational order. The use of a flexible\nspacer group, such as a short carbon chain, to link the me-\nsogens to the backbone,3 decouples the mesogens slightly\nfrom the backbone conformation; however, the backbone\nstill exerts a significant influence on mesomorphism. Such\nsystems usually include thermotropic mesogens, which may\nform smectic and nematic phases.4 The structure of the pen-\ndant mesogenic groups, the nature of the polymer backbone,\nthe molecular weight, the tacticity, and the length of the flex-\nible spacer length all exert an influence on mesophase for-\nmation.\nOver the years, there have been a number of experimen-\ntal studies of SCLCPs, aimed at understanding the relation-\nship between polymer structure and mesophase formation. At\nthe simplest level, optical microscopy and differential scan-\nning calorimetry \u0001DSC\u0002 can be used to determine phase\nboundaries.5 However, these provide no direct information\nabout the polymers at a molecular level. X-ray diffraction,6\nneutron diffraction,7,8 and small-angle neutron scattering7\u201315\n\u0001SANS\u0002 from well-aligned samples can, in principle, provide\nmolecular level information. For neutron studies, the use of\npartial deuteration is particularly helpful in providing struc-\ntural information about the arrangement of different parts of\nthe polymer in the bulk mesophase. For smectics, the results\npoint to a strong anisotropy in the conformations of the poly-\nmer backbone,10 with the perpendicular component of the\nbackbone radius of gyration \u0001i.e., perpendicular to the direc-\ntion of the order which is usually imposed by an aligning\nfield\u0002 being larger than the parallel component. In other\nwords, the backbone tends to align parallel to the smectic\nlayers. For nematics, the radius of gyration is also found to\nbe anisotropic. However, the nature of the anisotropy tends\nto be influenced by the presence\/absence of an underlying\nsmectic phase, which can induce smectic fluctuations within\nthe nematic. Many of the experiments in this area are tech-\nnically demanding. Not least, are the difficulties in obtaining\na good uniform alignment of the polymer, which sometimes\ndemands high magnetic aligning fields of greater than 9 T.10\nIn contrast with the area of low molecular weight liquid\ncrystals, where simulation has proved extremely successful\nat atomistic16\u201320 and semiatomistic levels,21\u201324 LCPs have\na\u0002Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here the twin prob-\nlems of large system sizes and long equilibration times have\nlargely prevented simulations at an atomistic level, though\nsome progress has been made at the semiatomistic level for\nMCLCPs.25,26 Consequently, information about the molecu-\nlar structure of SCLCPs within a mesophase is limited to that\nobtained from simple models which describe the x-ray and\nneutron results; and it has not been possible to produce simu-\nlations which examine the distribution of mesogenic groups,\nthe position of flexible spacers, or the conformation of the\nbackbone.\nIn the current study, we use a coarse-grained \u0001CG\u0002 simu-\nlation model to provide, for the first time, a molecular picture\nof the order within a bulk mesophase formed by a SCLCP.\nThe model polymer uses Lennard-Jones sites to represent the\nflexible siloxane backbone and the alkyl spacers, in combi-\nnation with CG mesogenic moieties represented by Gay\u2013\nBerne potentials. This hybrid model is described in detail in\nSec. II. In Sec. III we present results looking at the behavior\nof the model as the system is cooled from an isotropic poly-\nmer melt with and without the application of an aligning\npotential. Results of extremely long annealing simulations\nare presented also. The simulations allow us to look at the\nordering of the mesogenic units, the siloxane polymer back-\nbone, and the flexible spacers within the bulk mesophases\nthat form. Finally, we draw some conclusions in Sec. IV.\nII. COMPUTATION\nThe simulations described in this study use a model\nSCLCP based on the structure given in Fig. 1. The polymer,\nwhich has been the subject of a number of experimental\nstudies,27,28 has a polydimethylsiloxane \u0001PDMS\u0002 backbone,\nwith a flexible spacer composed of a hexyl chain attached to\neach silicon atom. Mesogens are attached to the spacers via\nan oxygen atom. Figure 1 provides a schematic representa-\ntion of the simulation model. The model used relies on a\ncoarse-grained description for a flexible molecule, which has\npreviously been adopted for the simulation of liquid crystal\ndimers,29 a flexible mesogen with tails at both ends of the\nmolecule23 and a main chain liquid crystal polymer.30 We use\na degree of polymerization of n=12, and 64 separate poly-\nmer chains giving a total of 768 mesogenic groups. Four\ndifferent types of site are used: representing silicon, oxygen\natoms, carbon-united atoms, which are the same for the CH2\nas CH3 groups, and an elliptical site representing the me-\nsogenic unit. The silicon atoms in the backbone are four\ncoordinate and so it is necessary to choose a stereochemistry\nfor the arrangement of the pendant groups in the model sys-\ntem. Accordingly, we choose a syndiotactic arrangement of\nthe side chains to minimize the steric repulsion between\nthem.\nThe force field used to describe the model system takes\nthe form\nETotal = \u0005\ni=1\nNangles ki\nang\n2\n\u0001\u0002i \u2212 \u0002i\n0\u00022 + \u0005\ni=1\nNGB\nki\nGBang\u0001\u0003i \u2212 \u0003i\n0\u00022\n+ \u0005\ni=1\nNdihedrals\n\u0003a1,i\u00011 + cos \u0004i\u0002 + a2,i\u00011 \u2212 cos\u00012\u0004i\u0002\u0002\n+ a3,i\u00011 + cos\u00013\u0004i\u0002\u0002\u0004 + \u0005\ni=1\nNLJ\n\u0005\nj\u00051\nNLJ\nULJ\n+ \u0005\ni=1\nNLJ\n\u0005\nj=1\nNGB\nULJ\/GB + \u0005\ni=1\nNGB\n\u0005\nj\u0005i\nNGB\nUGB + Uext, \u00011\u0002\nwhere Nangles, Ndihedrals, NLJ, and NGB are the number of\nangles, the number of dihedral angles, the number of\nLennard-Jones \u0001LJ\u0002 sites, and the number of Gay\u2013Berne\n\u0001GB\u0002 sites, respectively, in the system. In Eq. \u00011\u0002 a harmonic\npotential is used to model bond angle deformations, where\nki\nang is a bond angle force constant, \u0002i is the actual bond\nangle, and \u0002i\n0 is the equilibrium bond angle. The second term\nin Eq. \u00011\u0002 represents the angle between the orientation of a\nGay\u2013Berne site and the bond that connects it to the rest of\nthe molecule: referred to as a GB-angle. The deformation of\nthe GB-angle is modeled with a harmonic potential, with\nki\nGBang as the angular force constant and \u0003i and \u0003i\n0 as the\nactual and equilibrium GB-angles. The inclusion of the GB-\nangle term prevents free rotation of the mesogen about its\ncenter. The dihedral angle component of Eq. \u00011\u0002 is the third\nterm, where \u0004i is the dihedral angle and a1, a2, and a3 are\nconstants that parametrize the form of the potential for each\ntype of dihedral angle. The terms ULJ, ULJ\/GB, and UGB are\nthe nonbonding interactions between each pair of sites. In\nthis work, Lennard-Jones and Gay\u2013Berne sites are used to\nrepresent spherical and elliptical sites, respectively, and the\ncross term ULJ\/GB is represented by a generalized potential\nfor two unlike Gay\u2013Berne particles. The expression for ULJ,\nULJ\/GB, and UGB are given in full in our previous work for\nlow molecular weight flexible mesogens.23 The final term in\nEq. \u00011\u0002, Uext, represents the interaction of the sites with an\nexternal magnetic field.\nThe force field parameters were obtained from previous\nhybrid GB\/LJ studies of a liquid crystal dimer31 and a\nmesogen with tails at both ends,23 augmented by data from\nthe MM2 force field for the siloxane part and updating\nthe Ryckaert\u2013Bellemans potential \u0001used in Ref. 31\u0002 to\nthe more recent work by Martin and Siepmann32 and later\nNath and Khare.33 Bond lengths were constrained using the\nSHAKE procedure:34 using bond lengths Si\u2013O=1.626 \u00c5,\nSi\u2013C=1.880 \u00c5, C\u2013C=1.523 \u00c5, C\u2013O=1.402 \u00c5, and\nFIG. 1.

The form of the Gay\u2013Berne potential used\nhas been studied in detail by de Miguel and co-workers35\u201337\nand the phase diagram is well known. It is characterized by\nthe exponents \u0006=1 and \u0007=2; length-to-breadth ratio,\n\bee \/\bss=3; and ratio of well depths, \tee \/\tss=1\/5. We define\n\b0\nGB\n=\bss and \t0\nGB\n=\tss throughout this work. The full poten-\ntial is specified by parameters in Tables I\u2013IV. Spherical non-\nbonded cutoffs were employed throughout for ULJ, ULJ\/GB,\nand UGB at 9.0, 16.5, and 18.8 \u00c5, respectively. The GB and\nGB\/LJ nonbonded potentials were shifted to ensure that the\ninteractions went smoothly to zero. Long-range corrections\nto the energy and virial were evaluated for the LJ potential.\nSeparate Verlet neighbor lists were used for each of the three\nnonbonded cutoffs. All 1-2, 1-3, or 1-4 terms were excluded\nfrom the nonbonded interactions in Eq. \u00011\u0002.\nMolecular dynamics calculations were used to examine\nthe phase behavior of the polymer. The simulations were\ncarried out using the anisotropic form of the leapfrog\nalgorithm38 to solve the equations of motion, as implemented\nin the earlier work of one of the current authors on liquid\ncrystal dimers.29 The NpT ensemble was employed, at zero\npressure with a 2 fs time step throughout the studies. A\nsimple thermostat was implemented to allow the system to\ncollide with a heat bath every 100 steps in order to maintain\na constant temperature. The simulation box dimensions were\nallowed to vary using Monte Carlo moves, as described in\nthe earlier dimer study.29\nAn array of 64 identical polymer molecules were placed\nin a simulation box and preliminary simulations were under-\ntaken to relax the polymer configurations. These simulations\nwere conducted at 600 K to ensure that the polymer was able\nto move freely and form a melt.\nPreliminary investigations suggested that the system was\nextremely viscous and accordingly the annealing process was\nvery slow. Therefore, it was envisaged that, as in real silox-\nane polymers, liquid crystal monodomains would only be\nobtained on cooling in the presence of an external electric or\nmagnetic field. Consequently, an external potential was ap-\nplied for some of the runs to mimic an external magnetic\nfield. This torque on a mesogen in a magnetic field arises\nfrom the diamagnetic anisotropy of the mesogen. For most\ncalamitic liquid crystals the magnitude of the diamagnetic\nsusceptibility is larger perpendicular to the long molecular\naxis, rather than parallel to it, leading to a positive value for\nthe anisotropy in magnetic susceptibility \n\u000b \u0001i.e., \u000b\u0006 and \u000b\u0001\nare \u2212ve but \n\u000b= +ve\u0002, which causes the liquid crystal to\nalign parallel to the magnetic field. Accordingly, we adopt a\nsimple form for the external potential\nUext = \u0005\ni=1\nNGB\n\u2212 \tfieldu\u02c6zi\n2\n, \u00012\u0002\nfavoring orientations parallel or antiparallel to the applied\nfield \u0001z axis\u0002, where u\u02c6z is the z component of the Gay\u2013Berne\norientational vector.\nLuckhurst and Saielli39 have examined Gay\u2013Berne me-\nsogens in an external potential of this form. For high values\nof the strength parameter, \tfield, they find that smectic phases\ncan be induced from a nematic. In their work, values for \tfield\nof 0.5\t0GB, 5.0\t0GB, and 8.0\t0GB were used and phase transi-\ntions to the smectic were observed for the two larger field\nstrengths, while the system with \tfield=0.5 remained nematic.\nHowever, in the current study we were anxious not to apply\nan external potential of sufficient magnitude to induce shifts\nin the phase boundaries. Consequently, two trial potentials,\nTABLE II.

Each Gay\u2013\nBerne site was parametrized to match the ones in the SCLCP.\nThe test simulations were conducted at 400 K, with a 10-fs\ntime step and a cut-off radius of 18.88 \u00c5. Initially, we equili-\nbrated the test system at a state point in the nematic region of\nthe phase diagram and measured the equilibrium value of\n\u0007S2\b. We then applied the aligning potential perpendicular to\nthe liquid crystal director and measured the time taken for\nrealignment of the nematic and noted the equilibrium order\nparameter for the realigned phase. Here, we found that val-\nues of 0.5\f10\u221220 and 0.2\f10\u221220 J for \tfield were sufficient\nto align a nematic in 350 and 1000 ps, respectively. In the\ncase of the former, the equilibrium order parameter, \u0007S2\b, was\nunchanged relative to the original equilibrium nematic with\nno field applied. For the latter, \u0007S2\b changed by less than\n0.05. We note, in passing, that a value of \tfield of 1.0\n\f10\u221220 J is able to rapidly realign the director within 250 ps\nbut causes an increase in the nematic order parameter of\napproximately 0.15.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Phase behavior on cooling from isotropic melt\nTo observe the phase behavior of the model system, a\nsample was cooled slowly from an equilibrated isotropic\nmelt at 500 K over a period of 35 ns with no external poten-\ntial applied. A further two sets of molecular dynamics \u0001MD\u0002\nruns were started from the same isotropic configuration, em-\nploying \tfield values of 0.2\f10\u221220 and 0.5\f10\u221220 J, respec-\ntively. The configurations of the system at each temperature\nwere analyzed by computing order parameters, radial distri-\nbution functions, and diffusion constants.\nThe ensemble-averaged Gay\u2013Berne order parameter is\ngiven by\n\u0007S2\b = \u0007P2\u0001cos \u0002\u0002\b , \u00013\u0002\nwhere \u0002 is the angle of the Gay\u2013Berne axis relative to the\nuniaxial director of the system. \u0007S2\b is shown for the three\ncooling runs in Fig. 2. In the absence of an external potential\n\u0003Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002\u0004 the average overall order in the system does not\nchange significantly with cooling. However, application of\nthe small aligning potential, with \tfield=0.2\f10\u221220 J, is suf-\nficient to induce a large change in the order parameter during\nthe cooling run \u0003Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002\u0004, with growth in orientational order\nFIG. 2.

After which there is no change in orientational\nordering on further cooling. From the results of our earlier\ntest simulations on the Gay\u2013Berne mesogen \u0001Sec. II\u0002, the\naligning potentials are predicted to be too weak to induce a\nphase transition or influence the value of \u0007S2\b in a homoge-\nneous liquid crystal. However, the potentials should be suf-\nficiently large to influence the distribution of the local direc-\ntor in separate liquid-crystalline domains; thereby\ninfluencing \u0007S2\b for the system as a whole. This is discussed\nfurther below.\nTo understand better the structure of the polymer during\nthe cooling process, radial distribution functions were calcu-\nlated for Gay\u2013Berne sites using the final 1 ns of data for each\ntemperature. Results are shown for the radial distribution\nfunction g\u0001r\u0002 \u0001Fig. 3\u0002 and its components perpendicular,\ng\u0001\u0001r\u0002, and parallel, g\u0006\u0001r\u0002, to the director \u0001Fig. 4\u0002 and the\npairwise orientational distribution function, g2\u0001r\u0002 \u0001Fig. 5\u0002, for\nthree sample temperatures at 450, 350, and 250 K.\nAt 450 K, g\u0001r\u0002 curves in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 show typical liquidlike\nstructure, and are identical for each aligning potential. The\nnearest-neighbor peak is close to 5.3 \u00c5, the minimum in the\npotential for side-to-side interactions. The second nearest-\nneighbor peak is very weak, smaller than in most liquids,\nindicating no clustering of Gay\u2013Berne particles at this tem-\nperature. In addition, the lack of structure in g\u0006\u0001r\u0002 \u0003Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002\u0004\nconfirms that there are no layers or domains forming at this\ntemperature. In Fig. 5\u0001a\u0002, g2\u0001r\u0002 at 450 K shows some align-\nment of nearest neighbors in the first solvation shell. The\nvalue of g2\u0001r\u0002 at long distances tends to \u0007S2\b2 and we note\nthat a very small degree of field-induced long-range order is\nevident for the largest aligning potential. This is typical of\nthat seen in the isotropic pretransitional region of real me-\nsogens under the application of a strong electric field \u0001the\nKerr effect\u0002.40 However, the lower of value of \tfield is insuf-\nficient to produce any noticeable change in g2\u0001r\u0002 compared\nto the zero-field case.\nAt 350 K, the ordering potential induces clear changes in\nthe polymer structure. For the highest value of \tfield, g\u0001r\u0002\n\u0003Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0004 the nearest-neighbor peak grows and two other\npeaks are also evident at approximately two and three times\nthe separation distance of the nearest-neighbor peak. In Figs.\n4\u0001c\u0002 and 4\u0001d\u0002, peaks and troughs appear in g\u0006\u0001r\u0002, which are\nindicative of smectic layers and a typical dense liquidlike\nsignature is seen in g\u0001\u0001r\u0002, indicating that the smectic formed\nis a fluid, i.e., smectic A or smectic C. No layer ordering is\nseen for \tfield=0.2\f10\u221220 J at this temperature, though a\nsmall degree of long-range order is seen in g2\u0001r\u0002 \u0003Fig. 5\u0001b\u0002\u0004\nsuggesting that the system is close to the phase transition to\na liquid crystal.\nAt 250 K the radial distributions indicate that the two\nsamples cooled in a field are both in a smectic-A phase. All\nthree systems show three solvation shell peaks \u0003Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002\u0004,\nthere is also a possible fourth peak in the distribution for the\nsample in the \tfield=0.5\f10\u221220 J sample. In Fig. 5\u0001c\u0002, g2\u0001r\u0002\nshows an increase in orientational order for the systems with\nan external potential applied and the peaks indicate strong\norientational correlation out to the third nearest neighbor in\neach case. The presence of layers is shown in g\u0006\u0001r\u0002 \u0003Fig.\n4\u0001c\u0002\u0004 for the two systems in the aligning field. Here, it is\nFIG. 4.

III B\u0002. Figure 4\u0001f\u0002 shows the perpendicular compo-\nnent of the radial distribution function at 250 K, which\nshould show up any order within smectic layers. In the ab-\nsence of the aligning potential there is little structure but for\nthe samples in the external potential there are a number of\npeaks. As before, the liquidlike signature here suggests that\nthe smectic phase formed has no long-range in-layer order-\ning and is therefore a fluid smectic.\nConfigurations of the system were extracted from the\nthree cooling runs at a range of temperatures and a sample\nare shown in Fig. 6. At high temperatures, in the absence of\nan applied external potential, full mixing occurs between the\npolymeric parts of the molecule and the mesogens. When\nthis sample is cooled some microphase separation is evident\nfrom the formation of mesogen- and polymer-rich regions\nand the color coding in Fig. 6 indicates that alignment of\nGay\u2013Berne particles occurs within mesogenic domains.\nHowever, the local nematic director is effectively uncoupled\nwithin each domain. This explains the growth in the value of\ng2\u0001r\u0002 for short distances \u0003Fig. 5\u0001c\u0002\u0004 but the absence of any\nlong-range order.\nThe effect of the smaller aligning potential is seen in\ncolumn 2 of Fig. 6, where the system goes from complete\nmixing of mesogen and polymer at 450 K, to the start of\nmicrophase separation at 350 K. Here, however, in contrast\nwith the \tfield=0.0\f10\u221220 J simulation, microphase separa-\ntion leads to domains forming with the local domain director\npointing in a common direction. This in turn encourages\nlayer formation and well-defined smectic layers form as the\nsystem is cooled further.\nFinally, column 3 of Fig. 6 shows the system with an\nexternal potential of field strength 0.5\f10\u221220 J applied. With\nthis stronger field the system phase separates much sooner\nand layers can be seen even at 400 K. However, the order\nwithin these layers appears nematiclike. When the sample is\ncooled to 350 K the strata become well developed and a\npattern with one polymer layer sandwiched between two me-\nsogen layers emerges. The ordering inside the mesogenic\nlayers seems quite fluid at this stage. At 250 K the 2:1 mor-\nphology sharpens and smectic-A order within the mesogen\nlayers is observed, explaining the peaks in g\u0001\u0001r\u0002 in Fig. 4\u0001f\u0002.\nFor the higher value of \tfield, we have examined the be-\nhavior of the system, when the field is removed. Here, it\nseems clear that once formed, the lamellar morphology is\nstable over long time periods. For example, long annealing\nruns have been carried out at 300 and 350 K for 28 and 34\nns, respectively. In both cases, the additional, nonintrinsic\norder caused by the aligning potential is rapidly lost with a\ndrop in \u0007S2\b to approximately 0.62 occurring within the first\n0.5 ns of simulation time. However, the system then remains\nunchanged over the remainder of the run, with just the nor-\nFIG. 5.

Diffusion coefficients have been calculated for\nthree groups of sites in the molecule: all the Gay\u2013Berne sites,\nthe Lennard-Jones atom at the center of each polymer back-\nbone, and a Lennard-Jones atom at the end of each backbone\nchain, in each case using the limiting slopes over the final 2\nns at each temperature, shown in Table V. The data confirm\nthat the systems remain fluid down to 250 K and certainly at\nthe point where microphase separation and growth of layers\noccur at 350 K. As we would expect, motion is highest for\nthe mesogenic groups and smallest for the midchain atoms. It\nis interesting to compare the values here with those extracted\nfrom atomistic studies of low molecular weight liquid crys-\ntals in nematic phases. Usually, the latter are found to be ca.\n10\u221210 m2 s\u22121,41 that is 10\u2013100 times higher than those found\nfor the polymer studied here. The viscosity of the polymer\nand the smectic nature of the mesophase dramatically slow\nthe movement of sites. Plots of log D as a function of tem-\nperature are shown in Fig. 7. We note no large change in\nslope on cooling, as might be expected with a glass transi-\ntion. \u0001Though observation of this would be unlikely for the\nrelatively short polymers studied here and the relatively\nquick rate of cooling employed.\u0002 However, in each case we\nsee a small change in the slope of the log D between 300 and\n350 K, associated with microphase separation. This occurs\nfor both the polymer chain and the mesogens.\nB. Influence of long-time annealing and faster cooling\nTwo state points were chosen for further investigation.\nFor the \tfield=0.0\f10\u221220 J and \tfield=0.2\f10\u221220 J cases,\nlong annealing runs \u000138 ns\u0002 were carried out at a fixed tem-\nperature of 350 K, starting from the 350 K end points of the\nruns shown in Fig. 2, i.e., the point where microphase sepa-\nration starts to occur. In the presence of the smaller aligning\npotential, the order parameter grows over a period of 13 ns\nfrom a value of approximately 0.38\u20130.6, reaching a steady\nvalue of 0.62 over the course of the full 38 ns. Evidence\nfrom snapshots and distribution functions show that the same\nlamellar structure is formed as that obtained from the earlier\ncooling run with the high value of \tfield after annealing in the\nabsence of an applied potential. The order parameter here is\nalso identical to that obtained in the earlier simulation.\nWithout the aligning potential we were unable to fully\nanneal the structure to give well-formed lamellar layers,\nthough we do get a small growth in \u0007S2\b to a value of 0.2\nover the course of 38 ns. Extensive analysis of snapshots\nfrom this run shows the slow growth of at least two substan-\ntial liquid-crystalline domains with the local director of each\ndomain pointing in different directions. These are separated\nby polymer-rich regions in which the polymer has started to\nsegregate to form layers. The difficulty here in obtaining\nuniform layers without a field is not altogether surprising and\nit is worth noting that in many experimental studies of LCPs,\nthe high viscosity means that a strong external field \u0001often in\nthe region of 9 T or above for a magnetic field\u0002 must be\napplied to obtain good alignment.

However, time scales of several milliseconds may\nstill be needed. The 40 ns simulations described here repre-\nsent extremely long MD runs for a 2 fs time step. Currently,\nthe only hope for studying the development of bulk structure\nin SCLCPs over longer length scales comes from dissipative\nparticle dynamics \u0001DPD\u0002-type soft particle models, which\ncan use longer time steps and which have shorter correlation\ntimes. Of particular note in this context is the recent work on\nrod-coil diblock copolymers by Al Sunaidi et al.,42 which\ncould easily be extended to SCLCP systems.\nFor the \tfield=0.5\f10\u221220 J model, we have carried out a\nmore rapid cooling run starting from the isotropic melt at\n500 K and cooling by 50 K every 2 ns down to a temperature\nof 200 K. Here, we obtained a linear increase in \u0007S2\b up to a\nvalue of approximately 0.7 at the end of the 300 K run; and\nno change thereafter. Observation of snapshots and distribu-\ntion functions from this independent quench show the same\nlamellar smectic-A structure obtained previously. However,\nin this case, the layers have more defects caused by one or\nmore polymer backbones bridging between layers \u0001see be-\nlow\u0002. This is responsible for the small reduction in order\nparameter by about 0.03\u20130.04 in comparison with the previ-\nous slower cooling run in the same field.\nC. Structure of the polymer in the smectic-A phase\nThe polymer morphology for each system can be exam-\nined by looking separately at regions occupied by different\nparts of the SCLCP molecules. In Fig. 8 this is done for\nstate points at 350 K using the data from the cooling run with\n\tfield=0.2\f10\u221220 J \u0003Fig. 8\u0001b\u0002\u0004 and \tfield=0.5\f10\u221220 J \u0003Fig.\n8\u0001d\u0002\u0004, and the two long annealing runs described in Sec. III B\n\u0003Figs. 8\u0001a\u0002 and 8\u0001c\u0002\u0004. Figure 8\u0001a\u0002 confirms the presence of\nmicrophase separation in the absence of a field, showing the\npresence of large liquid crystal regimes with local directors\npointing in different directions. Also shown are the first signs\nof the formation of a lamellar layer in part of the simulation\nbox.\nIt is interesting to compare the snapshots from the\n\tfield=0.2\f10\u221220 J results in Figs. 8\u0001b\u0002 and 8\u0001c\u0002. With the\nfield applied, lamellar layers are able to form at the same\npoint as microphase separation starts to occur. At this stage\nthe polymer backbone straddles different mesogenic layers\nand this prevents the rapid annealing into well-defined layers\nthat one would expect in a low molecular weight system.\nIndeed for the additional quench run, where temperature was\ndropped by 50 K every 2 ns, this type of structure initially\nforms and is \u201cfrozen in\u201d at 200 K where further motion be-\ncome very sluggish. However, in annealing at 350 K over 38\nns, the polymer backbone is gradually expelled completely\nfrom the mesogen-rich areas. As a result of this, in Fig. 8\u0001b\u0002,\nthe Gay\u2013Berne mesogens, which remained nematic in Fig.\n8\u0001a\u0002, form a smectic-A structure with two clear layers of\nmesogens and the backbone is confined to a region about the\nwidth of a single smectic layer. The system size available in\nthis study is, of course, rather limited by computer time.\nConsequently the width of the smectic layers is probably\nFIG. 7. log10 D plotted as a function of temperature for \u0001a\u0002 \tfield=0.0\n\f10\u221220 J, \u0001b\u0002 \tfield=0.2\f10\u221220 J, and \u0001c\u0002 \tfield=0.5\f10\u221220 J. \u0001Filled dia-\nmonds: Gay\u2013Berne mesogens.

However,\nthe surprising result for the backbone is entirely consistent\nwith earlier x-ray-diffraction, neutron-diffraction, and small-\nangle neutron-scattering \u0001SANS\u0002 results, described in Sec. I.\nThe second interesting observation from the layer struc-\ntures in Fig. 8\u0001c\u0002 is that the flexible spacers in this study\nbecome confined to the layers also, forming a sandwich ei-\nther side of the polymer backbone. This has not been pre-\ndicted previously and is certainly a result of the strong affin-\nity that Gay\u2013Berne particles have for each other, which\ndrives the segregation of Gay\u2013Berne and Lennard-Jones sites\nas temperature is lowered.\nThe \u201cburrowing\u201d of the backbone between polymer-rich\nlayers is seen in the right-hand side of Fig. 8\u0001d\u0002 for the well-\nordered lamellar structure found in the high-field cooling\nrun. The backbone is always associated with attached spac-\ners, so burrowing therefore causes a sizable defect in the\nliquid-crystalline layer. In terms of mesogenic ordering, a\ndefect manifests itself by the formation of a region of nem-\natic ordering within a layer which would otherwise show\npure smectic-A ordering of the mesogens. For long chains,\none might expect that such defects must always occur, as\nconfigurational entropy will provide a larger driving force\nopposing confinement of single chains to individual layers.\nHowever, SANS studies by Richardson et al.10 indicate the\nsurprising result that the confinement of the backbone seems\nto increase with increasing molecular weight. The conclusion\nto this would be that chain ends are the important factor in\nfacilitating the hopping of the backbone between layers. It\nwould be interesting to test this by further simulation of\nlonger chains.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe work described in this study represents a detailed\nlook at the phase behavior of a model polysiloxane SCLCP\nusing a hybrid Gay\u2013Berne\/Lennard-Jones model. On cooling\nfrom a fully isotropic polymer, we see spontaneous mi-\ncrophase separation into polymer- and mesogen-rich regions.\nUnder the application of a small aligning potential, applied\nduring cooling, the structures formed on microphase separa-\ntion anneal to produce a smectic-A structure in which the\npolymer backbone is largely confined between the liquid\ncrystal layers. Several independent quenches have been car-\nried out varying the strength of the applied aligning potential\nand the degree of cooling. Each give the same smectic struc-\nture, which is stable upon removal of the field and appears to\nbe the equilibrium structure for the model polymer. Exten-\nsive annealing in the absence of a field gives liquid-\ncrystalline domains but the time scale required to form a\nuniform lamellar structure is too long to observe with mo-\nlecular dynamics.\nIn the well-aligned smectic phases, the backbone is\nfound to be perpendicular to the smectic-A director in agree-\nment with previous assumptions about the structure of\nSCLCPs and in agreement with the interpretations from ear-\nlier experimental work.8\u201311 The flexible spacers are found to\nform sublayers around a \u201cbackbone\u201d layer. For some\nquenches, defects were found where backbone chains span\ntwo layers. As expected, the number of such defects is found\nto depend strongly on the rate of cooling. In the vicinity of\nthe defects, the smectic-A structure of the mesogen-rich lay-\ners is disrupted to give nematiclike ordering.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank Professor Rob Richardson\n\u0001University of Bristol\u0002 for valuable discussions; the UK re-\nsearch council, EPSRC, for providing computer time and a\nstudentship for one of the authors \u0001L.M.S.\u0002 \u00011999\u20132002\u0002.\n1 H.
