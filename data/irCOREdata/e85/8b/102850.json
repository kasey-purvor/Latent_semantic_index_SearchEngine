INTRODUCTION \nIn a conventional cellular network, a base station (BS) \ncontrols a number of mobile station (MS) within its own \ncoverage area and all the terminals communicate directly with \nthe BS. However with an ever-increasing demand for mobile \ncommunications, we need to investigate new access schemes \nas well as novel system architectures to improve the offered \ncell capacities without increasing the required radio frequency \nspectrum. One of the main impediments to successful data \ntransmission is error due to fading and interference. In the \ncurrent conventional cellular networks, all MSs, even those far \naway from their BS have to communicate directly with the \naccess point, requiring high levels of radiated powers and \ncausing considerable interference to the neighboring cells. \nOne solution would be to reduce a cell size and thereby \nincrease the number of base stations. This way majority of \nusers will be closer to a base station and would create less \ninterference to others cells. However, this solution is not very \neconomical due to significant increase in network \ninfrastructure costs. Another possible solution to improve the \ncapacity of cellular network is to use the concept of relaying in \na cellular network. In a cellular network with relaying \ncapability (also commonly known as multihop cellular \nnetwork, or relaying system), the users are able to send their \ndata directly to the BS or use some relay stations (fixed or \nmobile) to relay their data to the BS. In such architecture, the \nlink is broken down into shorter paths requiring less power \nand hence creates less interference to the neighboring cell.  \nWith less interference, more users can be accepted in the \nsystem and the capacity is increased. In addition to capacity \nimprovement and power saving, another important benefit is \nthe coverage enhancement. Due to the varying characteristics \nof a wireless environment, there are usually blind spots in the \ncoverage. With the use of relaying the blind spots can be \neliminated effectively and hence the coverage of the system \ncan be enhanced.  \nIt is clear from the above discussions that multihop \narchitecture is a promising approach to the capacity and \ncoverage improvement of a cellular network [1]. In the last \nfew years many work have been done to qualify and quantify \nthe capacity and coverage enhancement with relaying. For \nthis, two different types of relaying network architecture have \nbeen studied. One suggested to use other users terminal to \nrelay the traffic (Mobile Relay Station, MRS) [2]-[4], while \nothers proposed to use Fixed Relay Station [5], [6]. The two \ndifferent concepts are illustrated in Fig.1. Due to their \ndifferent characteristics, each type of relay station (fixed or \nmobile) brings several advantages and disadvantages to the \ncellular networks, which are discussed in [7]. One of the main \nchallenges with MRS is the frequent inter-relay handoffs. Due \nto the MS\u2019s mobility, the propagation channel condition \nbetween the relayed MS and their RS change. If the quality of \nthe channel between MS and RS is getting worse, the relayed \nusers would probably need to handover to another RS with \nbetter channel quality. This process, particular to the relaying \nsystem, is called the inter-relay Handoffs (IRHO). If the IRHO \nhappen frequently, the relaying system will not be practical \nand the system performance might not be improved. The \nIRHO is an important issue when relaying is done through \nMobile RSs, since these latter are constantly moving \nconversely to the Fixed RS. Therefore it is important to look at \nthe impact that the IRHO can have on the system performance \nwith relaying. In the literature review on relaying system, \nthere are no works that treated this issue. In this paper, we \nfocus on how frequent the IRHO occurs in the relaying system \nwith MRS but also FRS, and on how much the inter-relay \nhandover affects the system capacity especially when relaying \nwith Mobile RS?  \nFirst, the description of the cellular networks with relaying \nwith MRS and FRS are described in section II. Then different \nalgorithms for the IRHO are proposed and explained in section \nIII. The simulation\u2019s results on the impact of the IRHO on the \nsystem performance are presented in section IV.

CELLULAR NETWORKS WITH RELAYING\nIn order to study the impact of the IRHO on the relaying \nsystem performance, two relaying network architecture, one \nwith MRS and one with FRS, are modeled. Their \nperformances are compared with the conventional cellular \nnetworks. Therefore in this section, a detailed description of \nthe cellular networks model with MRS and FRS are given for \nthe uplink scenario. \nA. System description \nFor both models (without and with relaying) all the \nassumptions are the same for fair comparisons. For example, a \npredetermined number of users are uniformly distributed over \nthe whole system. After the handover mechanism, the users \nselect the BS with the strongest pilot signal as the serving BS. \nSome users are considered active, which means they transmit \ninformation on the data channel while the rest are considered \nto be in an idle state.     \nIn the non-relaying model, the active users transmit their data \ndirectly to their serving BS. The received Signal-to-\nInterference Ratio (SIR) of each active user is calculated at the \nBS and the number of users in outage in the system is found. \nA user is considered in outage if its received SIR is below the \nSIR target. This process is repeated for several steps. One step \n(or snapshot) represents one location for all users. If the \nreceived SIR is below the SIR target for a certain number of \nsteps, the user is assumed to be unsatisfied. \nIn the relaying model with Fixed or Mobile RS, the active \nusers with bad channel quality relay their data to the BS \nthrough a relay station. References [Nou05a] showed the \nperformance is optimal when the relaying is carried out for all \nthe MS experiencing a SIR less than the SIR target in the \ndirect link. Therefore only the MSs in outage will relay their \ndata through a RS. The selection of the RS depends on \nwhether the RS is fixed or mobile and it is explained in the \nnext sub-sections. For simplicity, a maximum of two-hop \ncommunication (one hop for the MS-RS and one hop for the \nRS-BS communication) is considered in the relaying model. \nIn this paper, the MS transmit using the UMTS FDD air \ninterface. Since a RS cannot transmit and receive at the same \ncarrier frequency, two different carriers are needed in the \nrelaying system. The non-relayed MSs transmit directly to the \nBS either with one carrier frequency (F1) or with a second \ncarrier frequency (F2). While the RSs transmit to the BS with \nthe frequency F1 and the relayed MS with the frequency F2 to \nthe RS, see Fig. 1. In such a scenario, the same number of \nMSs should transmit in both carrier frequencies (F1 and F2). \nSince two carrier frequencies are used, in order to make fair \ncomparison, the model is compared with the non-relaying \nsystem using also two carriers.  \nThere is no interference between users transmitting in \ndifferent carriers but only between the users transmitting in the \nsame carrier frequency (F1 or F2).  \nIn order to keep low the level of interference in the system, a \nperfect distributed power control is implemented. It consists of \nbalancing all the received SIR around the SIR target. After the \npower control algorithm, the SIR of all the links MS-RS, RS-\nBS and MS-BS are calculated.  For a detailed calculation of \nthe different SIR please refer to [8]. The relayed users are \nconsidered in outage if at least one of the two hops \nexperiences a SIR below the SIR target. Thus the percentage \nof unsatisfied users in the relaying system can be calculated \nand compared to the non relaying case.  \nB. Relaying model with Mobile RS \nIn a cellular network with MRS, the potential candidates to \nrelay the signals are the non-active users. Depending on the \ndensity of the non-active users, a relayed MS can select from a \npool of users in idle state. However when a MS needs to be \nrelayed, it must choose a suitable mobile relay station amongst \nthe possible candidates. Not choosing the optimal relaying \nnode can have great impact on the overall system capacity. \nTherefore different relaying MS selection schemes were \nproposed and evaluated in [8]. The results showed the best \nsystem performance is obtained when the non-active MS \nwhom provide the strongest total SIR is selected as relay \nstation. Total SIR means the sum of the SIR in the two hop \nlinks (MS-MRS and MRS-BS). In this model, we assume one \nMRS can relay only one MS at a time. Therefore, if two MSs \nwant to relay with the same MS, the priority will be given to \nthe one with the worse link quality (using path loss as criteria) \nwith the BS. However, there are enough non-active MS are \nplaced in the system that all the MS requiring relaying are able \nto find a relay station.  \nC. Relaying model with Fixed RS \nIn a cellular network with FRS, a number of stations are \nplaced at specific locations in the cell so as to relay the signal \nof users in outage to the BS. Since there are only a few \nnumber of FRS in a cell, the relayed MS will have few choices \nto select a FRS. For that reason, the FRS selection is not an \nissue as important as with MRS, where there are many relay \ncandidates. In our relaying system, the relayed MS will select \namong the two closest FRS, the one with whom it experiences \nthe greatest SIR.  \nIt may happen that several MS select the same FRS since there \nare few FRS deployed. However, we have realistically \nassumed the FRSs are able to relay several MS at a time. As a \nresult, the FRS will send as much as data as the number of MS \nthat it relays. This is taken into account in the model by \nincreasing the data rate of each FRS in function of the number \nof relayed MS. As a consequence, the SIR target between the \nFRS and the BS will increase proportionally. Since a FRS \nrelay the data of several MS, it is very important to have a \nBS\nMS \nMS\nfreq. 2\nMS \nMS \nMRS \nfreq. 2 \nMRS\nfreq. 1\nBS\nMS\nFRS\nFRSFRS\nFRS\nfreq. 2\nfreq. 1MS\nfreq. 2\nMSfreq. 1\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In our \nrelaying model, we assume the FRS located at strategic \nlocation where they experience a LOS with the BS and are \nequipped with directional antenna in order to reduce \ninterference to the neighboring cells.  \nIII. INTER-RELAY HANDOVER SCHEME\nA. IRHO schemes for MRS \nIn a cellular network with MRS, all the are moving all the \ntime. During the relaying communication, the link quality of \nthe link MS-MRS or\/and MRS-BS might drop under certain \nthreshold. Consequently the relayed MS might need to change \nits MRS in order to achieve its traffic to the BS but also to \nminimize the overall interference in the system (Fig.2.). \nTherefore the decision on when a relayed MS should handover \nto another RS becomes critical (see Fig. 3). To answer theses \nquestions, three algorithms were proposed and compared \nthrough the simulation\u2019s results. \nFig. 2. Inter-relay HO due to mobility\n1) Inter-relay Handover Instantaneous (Inst-IRHO) \nThe first proposed algorithm is called \u201cInstantaneous-\nIRHO\u201d. The relay station selection scheme proposed in [8] is \nbased on the maximum total SIR. Whenever a MS requires \nrelaying it will choose among the non-active MS the one with \nthe maximum total SIR. Total SIR means the sum of the SIR \nin the two hop links (MS-MRS and MRS-BS). Therefore at \neach iteration, the relayed MS will inter-relay handoff if it \nfinds another non-active MS with greater total SIR. For \nexample in Fig. 3: \nIf Total SIR2 > Total SIR1 \u00c6 inter-relay handover from \nMRS1 to MRS2 \n2)  No Inter-relay Handover (No-IRHO) \nThe second proposed algorithm is called \u201cNo-IRHO\u201d. In \nthis scheme, when a MS selects a non active MS, it will keep \nthe same MRS until it stops relaying. As a result IRHO will be \navoided. However it is worth noting that the relayed MS will \nhandover with another non-active MS only if its MRS moves \nto another cell. \n3)  Inter-relay Handover based on requirement (SIR-\nIRHO) \nThe third proposed algorithm is called \u201cIRHO based on \nrequirement (SIR-IRHO)\u201d. In this algorithm, IRHO is carried \nout only when the quality of the two-hop link drops below \nanother link SIR with a certain margin. The relayed MS will \ninter-relay handover if there is another non-active MS with \nbetter link quality. In order to avoid frequent handover, the \nserving MRS will be changed only if the total SIR of another \nnon-active MS is greater than the total SIR of the current MRS \nplus a SIR margin for IRHO: \nIf Total SIR2 > Total SIR1 + SIRm_HO \u00c6 inter-relay \nhandover from MRS1 to MRS2 \nSIRm_HO is a margin value that decides on the inter-relay \nhandover frequency. \nFig. 3. Inter-relay Handover mechanism\nB. Relaying through Fixed Station \nIn a relaying system with FRS, the inter-relay handover is \naffected only by the mobility of the relayed MS since the RS \nhave a fixed location. Therefore the inter-relay handover has \nless impact on the system performance of the relaying system \nwith FRS than with MRS. Since the FRS are located in a \nspecific place where they can experience a very good \npropagation channel with the BS (e.g. LOS), the inter-relay \nhandover will depend mainly on the link quality between the \nMS and FRS. In the relaying system with FRS, at each \niteration the MS that requires relaying, will choose among the \ntwo closest FRS the one with whom it experiences the best \nSIR. Therefore it is unnecessary to implement different \nscheme (such as No-IRHO or SIR-IRHO) for inter-relay \nhandover between FRS. \nIV. IMPACT OF IRHO ON THE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE \nA. Environment Model \n The system modeled includes 19 hexagonal cells of radius \n2000m, with BS at the center of the cells employing omni \ndirectional antenna. The MS follow the mobility and the \npropagation model as proposed in [9] for the vehicular \nenvironment. An auto-correlated shadowing is considered \nbetween the MS and the BS. In the case of relaying with MRS, \nthere are no appropriate path loss models that describe the \nchannel between MSs since a mobile terminal is usually \npositioned around head. However, the Lee model, which takes \ninto account the receivers antenna height, is chosen as model \n[10]. For the relaying case with FRS, the FRS are placed at 5m \nabove the average rooftop and use the path loss model as in \nMRS 1 MRS 2 \nBS \nMobility\nt\nt+1 \nt-2 \nt-1 \nt-3 \nInter-relay Handover \nt-1 \nt-3 \nt+1 \ntt-2 \nRelayed MS \nWhen Inter-relay Handover?\nMRS 2\nMRS 1\nRelayed MS\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The uplink scenario with the same fixed transmission rate \nfor voice service is applied to all the active users and the \nrelaying model is applied to all the 19 cells. The model is \nsimulated at system level and the simulation has been run for \n1000 correlated snapshots. The simulation result is based on \nthe percentage of non-satisfied user. A user is considered non-\nsatisfied if its SIR is not above or equal to the SIR target - 0.5 \ndB for a certain period of time (the period chosen is 5 \nconsecutive seconds from [9]). At the end of the simulation, \nthe numbers of non-satisfied users were calculated without \nand with relaying (MRS and FRS) for the central cell and \ncompared. \nB. Results \n1) Impact of IRHO \nEach algorithm has been tested with dynamic system level \nsimulator. For each algorithm, the probabilities of non-\nsatisfied users for different number of active users are plotted \nin Fig. 4. The three different algorithms are compared with the \nnon-relaying system. For a probability of 2% of non-satisfied \nusers, the non relaying system can support 92 users per cell.  \nFirst, it is important to note that the relaying system with \nany of the proposed scheme have a better performance than \nthe non-relaying system. Among the three different proposed \nschemes, the best performance is obtained with the Inst-IRHO. \nBy selecting the non active MS whom provide the strongest \ntotal SIR at any time, the interference in the system is \nminimized and the system performance is optimal. For 2% of \nnon-satisfied users, the number of users accepted in the cell in \nthe relaying system with Inst-IRHO is 136, leading to 48% of \ncapacity gain compare to the non-relaying system. However, \nthis scheme does not consider the expenses due to frequent \ninter-relay handoffs. \nIt is seen that the second proposed scheme \u201cNo-IRHO\u201d get \nthe worse performance out of the three different algorithms. \nWhen a relayed MS selects a MRS, it will keep the same MRS \nuntil it does not need to relay. This is an efficient scheme to \navoid IRHO but the relayed MS and its MRS are moving all \nthe time, so their channel condition might not therefore be \nalways the best. In a bad channel condition, the relayed MS \nand the MRS will increase their transmit power, which will \nincrease the overall interference and the performance will not \nbe optimal. Nevertheless, even with this scheme, the capacity \nis improved by 20% for 2% of non-satisfied users. \nThe third algorithm SIR-IRHO gets better performance than \nthe No-IRHO scheme but less than the Inst-IRHO scheme. In \nthis scheme, the relayed MS will inter-relay handoff only if \nthe link quality with another MRS is much greater. Therefore, \nthis scheme avoids frequent handovers such as in the Inst-\nIRHO scheme while providing a reasonable performance gain \nto the system. The capacity gain of the relaying system with \nSIR-IRHO depends on the SIRm_HO. The greater is the \nSIRm_HO, the less inter-relay handoff occurs. For a \nSIRm_HO equal to zero, the system performance is the same \nthan the case with Inst-IRHO. For 2% of non satisfied users, \nthe capacity gain with MRS is equal to 35% with a SIRm_HO \nof 14dB. \n60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nvoice users\/cell\nN\non\n S\nta\ntis\nfie\nd \nUs\ner\ns \n(%\n)\nWithout Relaying\nNo\u2212IRHO\nSIR\u2212IRHO (SIRm\u2212HO=14dB)\nSIR\u2212IRHO (SIRm\u2212HO=8dB)\nSIR\u2212IRHO (SIRm\u2212HO=4dB)\nInst\u2212IRHO\nFig. 4. Impact of Inter-relay Handover \n2) Probability IRHO vs. MS speed \nIn Fig.4. the capacity gain provided by the different \nalgorithm were shown without considering the number that \nIRHO happen. In this section, we compare at how frequent the \ninter-relay handover occurs for each algorithm. The \nprobability of IRHO is the probability that a relayed MS \nchange its RS during the relaying communication. It \nrepresents among the MS that were relaying, the number of \nrelayed MS that handover to another RS. The probabilities of \nIRHO for different MS\u2019s speed with MRS and FRS are plotted \nin Fig. 5. \nAs expected, the Inst-IRHO is the scheme that causes the \nmost inter-relay handover, which will considerably increase \nthe signaling in the relaying system. The No-IRHO scheme \nwill keep low the signaling at the expenses of a less gain in the \nsystem performance. A good compromise would be to employ \nthe SIR-IRHO scheme. The result show that the probability of \nIRHO based on requirement is quite low in Fig. 5 while \nkeeping a good capacity improvement in Fig.4. This algorithm \nis a good trade-off between the extra signaling and gain in the \nsystem performance. \nPredictably, the probability of IRHO in the relaying system \nwith FRS is quite low. One can see that the probability of \nIRHO with MRS based on requirement with a SIRm_HO of \n14 dB is equal to the probability of IRHO with FRS. This \nshows that in this scheme, the relayed MS change MRS as \noften as in the relaying system with FRS. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The \ncapacity of the conventional cellular network could be \nimproved by 20 to 50% depending on the inter-relay handover \nscheme employed. The result showed that even when inter-\nrelay handover is not permitted (No-IRHO scheme); the \ncapacity can still be improved by 20% with relaying. \nHowever, with an appropriate SIR window in the SIR-IRHO \nscheme, the relaying system with MRS can improve the \ncapacity of the conventional cellular network as well as \nlimiting frequent handoffs between the relay stations. The \ncapacity of the cellular network with MRS is improved by \n35% with the SIR-IRHO scheme.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Vodafone UK to fund this \nresearch. \nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
