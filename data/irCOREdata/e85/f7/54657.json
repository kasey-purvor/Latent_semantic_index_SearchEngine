Greater research into the \ninfluence of personality upon athlete leadership preferences is encouraged.          \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 3\nIntroduction \nEffective leadership in sport appears to be determined by interactions between multiple \nfactors such as leader behaviour, athlete characteristics, and situational factors \n(Chelladurai, 2001; Horn, 2008). Riemer (2007) suggests that leadership is a complex \nbehavioural process that involves dealing with group dynamics, interpersonal \ncommunications, and achievement or moving towards goals. Leadership behaviours \nappear to influence both performance and satisfaction of teams and athletes. Barrow \n(1977, p.232) defined leadership as, \u2018the behavioural process of influencing individuals \nand groups towards set goals.\u2019 In sport settings, leadership is primarily provided by \ncoaching staff and represents coaching behaviours.   \n The multidimensional model of leadership (Chelladurai, 1978, 1990, 1993, 2001) \nis a theoretical framework that is based upon an interactional view of leadership in sport. \nCentral to this model is the hypothesis that team performance and satisfaction are \nprimarily determined by the extent to which a coach\u2019s actual behaviour matches the \npreferences of athletes (within situational constraints). When congruence is achieved (i.e. \nwhen a coach\u2019s actual behaviour matches the athletes preferred behaviours and the \nbehaviours required in a given situation) then performance and satisfaction will be \nexpected to increase (Riemer, 2007).  Although research findings have not consistently \nsupported this hypothesis, issues concerning measurement of leaders\u2019 actual behaviours \nand congruence are thought to have contributed to a lack of clarity (Riemer & Toon, \n2001).  \nLeadership preferences have most often been studied in sport by using the \nLeadership Scale for Sports (LSS; Chelladurai & Saleh, 1980). The LSS measures five \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 4\nleadership behaviours: training and instruction (i.e. behaviours aimed at improving \nperformance); democratic behaviour (i.e. participatory style); autocratic behaviour (i.e. \npersonal authority); social support (i.e. focus on welfare of athletes); and positive \nfeedback (i.e. use of praise or rewards). Research suggests that training and instruction, \nand positive feedback are the two most preferred behaviours of athletes, while autocratic \nbehaviours are least preferred (cf. Chelladurai, 1993).  According to Riemer (2007) \nathlete preferences for leadership behaviours are thought to be a function of an \nindividual\u2019s characteristics (i.e. abilities, traits, needs).  \nAlthough Chelladurai (1990, 1993) has suggested greater attention is needed in \nrelation to the influence of personality factors on leadership preferences of athletes, few \nresearchers have investigated this aspect. However, Horn and Glenn (1988) found \nathletes with an internal locus of control showed preferences for coaches who exhibited \nmore training and instructive behaviours. More recently, Horn (2008, p. 244), suggested \n\u2018we can no longer assume that one set of coaching behaviours will be effective for all \nathletes in all sports situations. Rather, we should recognise that effective coaching \nbehaviours will vary as a function of the athlete and the sport context.\u2019 Given a lack of \nresearch concerning personality and leadership preferences, and suggestions that \ncongruence between athlete preferences and actual coaching behaviours might influence \nboth athletic performance and satisfaction (Chelladurai, 1990, 1993), it would seem \nappropriate to further examine how personality factors might relate to preferences for \ncertain types of coaching behaviours. Attaining such knowledge could allow a coach to \nmanipulate his or her coaching behaviours to attain congruence with athlete preferences.      \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 5\n       Mental toughness has recently emerged as an important psychological construct that \nis related to success in sport (cf. Crust, 2008). Clough, Earle and Sewell (2002) suggested \nmental toughness is a trait-like construct that allows individuals to remain relatively \nunaffected by competition or adversity. Mentally tough athletes are posited as having \nlower anxiety levels than others and an unshakeable faith that they control their own \ndestiny (Clough et al., 2002). Clough et al. (2002) forwarded their own 4C\u2019s model of \nmental toughness (Control, Commitment, Challenge, and Confidence) and a \npsychometric measurement instrument (MTQ48) based upon their definition and model. \nA recent behavioural-genetic study (Horsburgh, Schermer, Veselka, & Vernon, 2009) of \nthe relationships between mental toughness and personality has offered good support to \nthe conceptualisation of mental toughness proposed by Clough et al. Furthermore, \nHorsburgh et al. reported exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis on the MTQ48 \nthat supported the original six-factor structure of the measure (challenge, commitment, \nemotional control, life control, confidence in abilities and interpersonal confidence), and \nsuggested that individual differences in mental toughness between adult twins were \nlargely attributable to genetic and non-shared environmental factors.  \n In this study, we examined athletes\u2019 preferences for leadership behaviours with \nrespect to mental toughness. Given that mental toughness appears to reflect athletes with \nan internal locus of control, and previous work has showed an internal locus related to \npreferences for training and instructional behaviours (Horn & Glenn, 1988), a positive \nrelationship between mental toughness and preference for training and instructional \nbehaviours was hypothesised. Since recent researchers have suggested that seeking social \nsupport may be incompatible with mental toughness (Nicholls, Polman, Levy & \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 6\nBackhouse, 2008) a negative relationship between mental toughness and preference for \nsocial support was hypothesised.  \n \nMethod \nParticipants \nParticipants were 103 athletes who all regularly participated in a variety of team sports \n(e.g., football, rugby, netball etc.) in the north of England. The sample consisted of 66 \nmen (M age = 22.58 years, SD = 4.99) and 37 women (M age = 21.11 years, SD = 2.80).  \nOf the participants, 36 were club \/ university athletes while the remaining 67 participants \nwere competing at county standard. All participants completed an informed consent form \nprior to data collection. Ethical clearance for this research was achieved through the \nresearch ethics committee of York St. John University. \n \nInstruments \nThe Leadership Scale for Sports (LSS; Chelladurai & Saleh, 1978) was used to assess the \nleadership preferences of athletes. The LSS contains 40-items that are scored on a 5-point \nscale, with each item prefaced with the words \u2018I prefer my coach to\u2026\u2019 This inventory \ncontains five subscales that provide a comprehensive assessment of preferred coaching \nbehaviours. Training and instruction (1) represents coaching behaviours aimed at \nimproving performance through strenuous physical training, and includes emphasis on \nboth technical and tactical components, as-well-as structuring and coordinating member \nactivities. Democratic coaching behaviours (2) allow athletes to participate in decision-\nmaking processes, while in contrast autocratic behaviours (3) reflect independent \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 7\ndecision-making and represent the coach as an authority figure. Coaching behaviours that \ndemonstrate social support (4) are characterised by a concern for the welfare of athletes \nand are aimed at generating a positive group atmosphere. Finally, positive feedback (5) \nrepresents behaviours that reinforce an athlete by recognising and rewarding good \nperformance (Chelladurai, 1990). The vast majority of research concerning athlete \npreferences for leadership behaviours has employed the LSS (Riemer, 2007). In general, \nthe LSS has been found to have adequate psychometric properties, with the results of \nanalyses supporting the validity and reliability of the measure (cf. Chelladurai, 1993; \nChelladurai & Riemer, 1998).  \n \nMental Toughness \nThe MTQ48 (Clough et al., 2002), was used to measure mental toughness. This \ninstrument was developed following qualitative work investigating elite athletes, coaches \nand sport psychologists\u2019 perceptions and understanding of mental toughness in applied \nand theoretical contexts. Responses are made to the 48-items on a 5-point Likert scale \nranging from (1) strongly disagree, to (5) strongly agree. The MTQ48 has an overall test-\nretest coefficient of 0.9, and previous studies have found high alpha coefficients for the \nMTQ48 (Nicholls et al., 2008). The psychometric development of the MTQ48 (cf. Earle, \n2006) involved principal components analysis with varimax rotation. The most \nsatisfactory solution was found to be a six-factor structure (challenge, commitment, \nemotional control, life control, confidence in abilities and interpersonal confidence). \nChallenge (1) describes the extent to which individuals view problems as opportunities \nfor personal development, and thrive in changing environments. Commitment (2) reflects \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 8\nbeing deeply involved in what one is doing, and being able to persist despite obstacles or \ndifficulties.  Individuals who score high in emotional control (3) are able to keep their \nanxieties in check and are less likely to reveal their emotions to others. Life control (4) \nreflects a belief in personal influence as opposed to powerlessness. Individuals with high \nconfidence in abilities (5) tend to be more optimistic and less dependent on external \nvalidation, while interpersonal confidence (6) reflects individuals who are more assertive \nand less likely to be intimidated in social settings. Clough et al. (2002) provided evidence \nfor the construct validity of the MTQ48 with significant relationships reported with \noptimism (r = 0.48), self-image (r = 0.42), life satisfaction (r = 0.56), self-efficacy (r = \n0.68), and trait anxiety (r = 0.57). In respect of criterion validity, the MTQ48 has been \nfound to correlate with pain tolerance (Crust & Clough, 2005) and a short-form version of \nthe questionnaire has been shown to relate to injury rehabilitation (Levy, et al., 2006). \n \nProcedures \nParticipants were solicited through advertisements at a number of local sports facilities \nwhere sports clubs and teams were known to regularly train. Brief information \nconcerning the nature of the study was given in the advertisements along with requests \nfor athletes who regularly competed in competitive sports and were over the age of 16 \nyears, to complete two questionnaires. All participants were assured of confidentiality \nand informed of their right to withdraw consent. Questionnaires were completed \nindividually and in isolation and were administered via the second named author who had \nexperience in administering questionnaires. Completion of the questionnaires occurred in \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 9\na variety of settings that were convenient, comfortable and non-threatening for \nrespondents. Participants were not compensated for their involvement in the study.   \n \nData Analysis \nData screening was used to ensure all dependent variables met the assumptions necessary \nfor the use of parametric statistics prior to data analysis. Descriptive statistics (means, \nstandard deviations) for all measures were also calculated. Pearson Product Moment \nCorrelations were computed between all of the LSS factors, total mental toughness and \nthe subscales of the MTQ48. Linear regression analysis (backward procedure) was used \nto determine the relationship between athletes\u2019 leadership preferences and mental \ntoughness. Each subscale of the LSS acted as a dependent variable, with each of the six \nsubscales of the MTQ48 acting as independent variables. \n \nResults \nStandard measures of skewness and kurtosis found the data to be normally distributed and \nas such use of parametric statistics was deemed appropriate. Descriptive data for \nresponses to the MTQ48 and LSS questionnaires can be viewed in table 1. Results of the \ncorrelation analyses are presented in table 2. Only the training and instruction subscale of \nthe LSS was found to significantly correlate with total mental toughness (r = .40, P < \n0.01). With the exception of interpersonal confidence, all other subscales of the MTQ48 \nwere found to be significantly and positively related to a preference for training and \ninstructive behaviours (r = .22 to .36).  The only other significant correlations found \nbetween subscales concerned the relationship between confidence in abilities and two \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 10\nsubscales of the LSS (democratic behaviours and social support). In both cases significant \nand negative correlations were reported that represent athletes who were more confident \nin their abilities showing less preference for democratic behaviours (r = -.27, P < 0.01) \nand social support (r = -.20, P < 0.05) from coaches.  Further to this it is worth reporting \ntwo other borderline significant correlations between the MTQ48 subscale of emotional \ncontrol, and preferences for democratic behaviour (r = -.19, P = 0.06), and social support \n(r = -.19, P < 0.06).  \n Results of the linear regression analyses can be viewed in table 3. A number of \nthe MTQ48 subscales were found to significantly predict preferences for coaching \nbehaviours, but only commitment and challenge were significant predictors of preference \nfor training and instructive behaviours, accounting for approximately 18% of the variance \nin this variable. The R2 values reported, reflect that the independent variables (mental \ntoughness subscales) accounted for between 6 and 18% of the variance in preferences for \ncoaching behaviours. Cohen and Cohen (1983) describe procedures for estimating effect \nsize in regression analyses which involves the transformation of R2 values into an f 2 \nequation. By convention, f 2 values of 0.02, 0.15 and 0.35 are considered small, moderate \nand large effects in regression. According to the estimates provided by Cohen and Cohen, \nthe amount of variance accounted for with respect to training and instructive behaviours \n(18%) and democratic behaviours (14%) is moderate. While significant R2 values were \nreported for autocratic, social support, and positive feedback behaviours, the amount of \nvariance explained, and effect size is considered small.         \n \nDiscussion \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 11\nThis study examined the relationship between mental toughness and athletes\u2019 preferred \nleadership behaviours. Consistent with theoretical predictions, a significant and positive \nrelationship (r = 0.40, P <.01) was found between total mental toughness and a \npreference for training and instructive behaviours (i.e. skill development aimed at \nimproving performance). This finding appears to be consistent with conceptualisations of \nmental toughness that emphasise an internal locus of control and a task oriented focus \n(Gucciardi, Gordon & Dimmock, 2008; Jones, Hanton & Connaughton, 2007). However, \nresults from the regression analyses found that only the MTQ48 subscales of commitment \nand challenge were significant predictors of a preference for training and instructive \nbehaviours. Previous research had identified a preference for training and instructive \nbehaviours in athletes with an internal locus of control (Horn & Glenn, 1988), and with a \nhigh need for information and structure in their environment (Chelladurai & Carron, \n1981). It is likely that mentally tough athletes\u2019 preference for training and instructive \nbehaviours reflects a commitment to and striving for performance enhancement. Despite \nthis finding, it is important to place such results into context, given that previous research \nhas identified that in general, athletes prefer training and instructive coaching behaviours \n(Chelladurai, 1993). The present research suggests that a preference for training and \ninstructive behaviours is even stronger in mentally tough athletes.      \n  The direction of the relationship between total mental toughness and preference \nfor social support was consistent with theoretical predictions although the correlation was \nnot found to be significant (r = -.12, p > .05). Results of the regression analysis did find \nthat challenge, emotional control (negative weighting) and confidence in abilities \n(negative weighting) were significant predictors of preference for social support, although \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 12\ntogether, these subscales only accounted for approximately 8% of the variance in social \nsupport. Nicholls et al. (2008) had suggested that seeking social support was \nincompatible with mental toughness, although recent qualitative research has found social \nsupport to be important in the development of mental toughness (Connaughton, Wadey, \nHanton & Jones, 2008). The present results suggest that total mental toughness was not \nsignificantly related to a preference for social support, positive feedback, democratic or \nautocratic behaviours.     \nWith regard to correlations between the subscales of the questionnaires, it was \nfound that the MTQ48 subscale of confidence in abilities was significantly and negatively \nrelated to preferences for democratic behaviours and social support. Thus there is \nevidence that athletes who have high belief in their own abilities are less likely to prefer \ncoaching behaviours that emphasise a participatory style and concern for athletes\u2019 \ninterpersonal needs and welfare. This appears to suggest such individuals are self-reliant, \nand may prefer a more task-focused, no-nonsense approach from leaders rather than the \nchance to participate in decision-making.  \nThe linear regression analyses found that subscales of the MTQ48 were \nsignificant predictors of all five coaching behaviours measured by the LSS, although the \namount of variance explained by predictor variables was small to moderate. Despite \nsignificant findings, drawing any firm conclusions should be avoided where R2 values are \nless than 0.1 (autocratic behaviours, social support behaviours and positive feedback \nbehaviours), as less than 10% of the variance in dependent variables is accounted for in \nthe independent variables. Interestingly, emotional control and life control were quite \ndifferently related to preference for democratic behaviours and positive feedback. \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 13\nSpecifically, while emotional control negatively loaded against democratic behaviours \nand positive feedback, life control positively loaded against both variables. This finding \nappears to offer support to Clough et al. (2002) who found these aspects of control were \nrelated, but distinct factors.  \nThe results for the total sample in this study (see table 1) are consistent with \nprevious research (cf. Riemer, 2007) that has shown training and instructive behaviours \nand positive feedback to be the most preferred, and autocratic behaviours to be the least \npreferred leadership behaviours of athletes. Despite these results, the present study is \nlimited in a number of ways and most obviously with regard to a relatively small sample \nsize, the use of self-report inventories, and the correlational nature of the investigation. \nFurthermore, the present study used participants who were either club or county standard \nperformers, and it is not known how these results would generalise to other populations \nsuch as national or international athletes. Further research is required not only concerning \nthe leadership preferences of mentally tough athletes, but also considering the more \ngeneral role of personality in such regards.  \nGiven the purported benefits (performance and satisfaction) of attaining \ncongruence between athlete preferences for coaching behaviours and actual coaching \nbehaviours (Chelladurai, 1990, 1993), future research could attempt to test such \npredictions with respect to mental toughness. For example, it would be possible to test \nhow the performances or satisfaction of more mentally tough athletes (as opposed to less \nmentally tough athletes) were influenced by incongruence between athlete preferences \nand coach behaviours. It might be predicted, based on the conceptualisation of mental \ntoughness proposed by Clough et al. (2002), that mentally tough athletes would be less \n  Leadership and Mental Toughness \n \n 14\naffected by incongruence given their ability to perform consistently regardless of \nsituations or conditions. \nOverall, the results of this study indicate that mentally tough athletes show \npreferences for leadership behaviours that are aimed at improving performance and skill \ndevelopment. This appears consistent with conceptualisations of mentally tough athletes \nas internally motivated, determined to succeed, focused on the task at hand with a high \nwork ethic (Gucciardi et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2007). Other researchers have found \nmentally tough athletes to plan and prepare for competition meticulously (Bull et al., \n2005: Jones et al., 2007) and such athletes would likely be seeking information to refine \ntheir performances. Athletes who were found to have high confidence in their abilities \nshowed lower preferences for democratic behaviours or social support. Because of high \nself belief, these individuals are perhaps more likely to be able to cope with adversity and \nchallenges without relying on others for support. The implication of this research for \ncoaches working with mentally tough athletes is that to match athlete preferences (and \npotentially increase athlete satisfaction and performance), training and instructive \nbehaviours should predominate.   \n \nReferences \nBarrow, J.
