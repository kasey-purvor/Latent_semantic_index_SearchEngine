Other challenges include the reduction in funding and \nsubsequent impacts on services, the lending of electronic documents restricted by rights \nmanagement software and licenses, as well as the opportunities and potential threats offered by \nopen access resources.  Finally there seems to be a need to demonstrate effectively to senior \nmanagement the value of interlending services to patrons. \nOriginality \u2013 Provides an overview of developments in interlending within the UK sector by a \ncurrent practitioner and service manager. \nKeywords - document delivery, interlending, United Kingdom, 2011 \nPaper type - General Review \nOverview \nIf there was ever going to be a challenging time to be an interlending librarian or team member that \ntime is now (McGrath, 2011).  Since the last review of the UK scene appeared in print (Prowse, \n2009) it can be considered that there has been an effective sea change in the national interlending \nlandscape due to a variety of mostly external influences.  This is an era of ever increasing levels of \nelectronic resources, which further exacerbates the pre-existing right-here-right-now click-through \npatron culture (Appleyard et al, 2011).  For interlenders this means dealing with the increased \nservice demands from vastly raised customer aspirations and expectations.   \nWhen these factors are partnered with the reported reduction in the number of user generated \ninterlending requests and placed against the background of the current global financial crisis and \nsubsequent reductions to library budgets it may seem for document supply services that any light at \nthe end of the tunnel may simply be an oncoming train of uncertainty than a hoped for renaissance. \nThat said, in this article will present a sense of the major fears, expectations and issues that \ncurrently permeate the UK interlending sector and demonstrate that while there are significant \nchallenges, the interlending community is facing up to them and seeking to make the most of the \nopportunities they also offer.  This is illustrated by comments from UK sector practitioners and \nworkers. \n Survey of UK Interlenders \nIn an effort to gather some broad insight from sector workers an anonymised online web mounted \nquestionnaire was employed (Appendix A; SurveyMonkey, 2011), distributed via mailing lists as \nwell as promoted through various social networks.  While specific examples are noted, most of the \nunattributed opinions and quotes expressed in this article are drawn from this work rather than the \nauthor. \nIn the survey the following questions asked were: \nTable 1: Survey Questions \n1. Sector of respondent \n2. Experienced recent ILL patron request levels  \n3. Experienced recent loan request levels from other libraries  \n4. Anticipated biggest service challenges for 2011\/12 \n5. Anticipated biggest service opportunities for 2011\/12 \n6. Most significant recent interlending developments \n7. Additional comments \nOverall 46 respondents generated nearly 250 individual comments.   \nTable 2: Respondents Employment Sector \n\u2022 Academic  \n\u2022 Public Library    \n\u2022 Governmental  \n\u2022 NHS \n\u2022 Private \n77% \n19% \n5% \n2% \n2% \n \nThe majority (77%) of respondents came from the educational sector, and as such a level of bias in \nthe comments must be appreciated.  Representatives from Health, Governmental and Public \nlibraries did however make up the remainder of the sample.  While this was by no means a \ncomprehensive or rigorous survey, I believe it is broadly representative of the sector\u2019s current \nexperiences given discussions with others in the sector.  As well as this paper a further examination \nof this work was presented at a recent interlending workshop (Johnson, 2011).   \nService Perceptions & Trends \nFrom the survey it is clear that across the sector there is a moderate but not extreme trend towards a \nreduction in levels of patron interlibrary loans requests (figure 1).  In part this is doubtless due to \nthe increase in freely available quality open access resources, as well as tumbling costs of second \nhand books via reseller sites including Amazon or eBay.  That some respondents are experiencing \nan increase in the number of patron requests is heartening, although as some commentators noted \nthis  may be due to a reduction in acquisition or subscription budgets and subsequent provision of \ntexts within their respective library services. \n \nFigure 1: Changes to levels of patron ILL requests \n \nFigure 2: Changes to levels of interlending requests from other libraries \n \nBy contrast for many there appears to have been a moderate or greater increase in the interlending \ndemands made of the libraries by other document supply services recently (figure 2).  In part this \nmay well be attributable to the difficulties experienced by the sector caused by the British Library's \n(BL) asbestos removal and refurbishment programme (British Library Board 2011a).   \n\u2022 \u201cStock moves at British Library are causing all sorts of challenges at the moment. We are \nreceiving replies saying \"temp unavail reapp July 2012\", by which time the student would \nhave finished their course. This means that I spend more time checking for lending locations \nof items which would normally have been supplied by British Library. This means that all \nlibraries have seen quite a dramatic increase in the number of incoming requests\u201d  \n\u2022 \u201cThe asbestos problem at BL is having the effect of causing a marked increase in outgoing \nloans and article supply.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cI think the extended curtailment of availability of BLDCS stock will impact ILL and \npotential for alternative document supply solutions.\u201d \nWhile this was initially anticipated to last for most of 2011 there have been two recent \ndevelopments.  Firstly the BL has prioritised restoring access to heavily in-demand items.  \nSecondly, some respondents have reported receiving notices informing them of the unavailability of \nmaterials through to late 2012; far beyond the originally announced year long disruption period.  \nThe BL has noted that these are longer term inaccessible materials, such as music scores and some \nofficial publications, which are  less frequently in demand and hence the de-prioritisation of their \navailability, but this will still be an issue in supplying some patrons. \n\u2022 \u201cFunnily enough, the asbestos problem at BL is having the effect of causing a marked \nincrease in outgoing loans and article supply, as it reinforces our strong position in the field \nof interlending.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cOur move to ILLiad has exposed us to many more overseas libraries (through \nOCLC\/WCRS). This is bringing us more income, particularly through scans which really \ncost us nothing other than our time.\u201d \nAs a result the use of alternative locations for supply has been a minor boon to interlenders able to \npotentially offset a larger proportion of their ILL budgets in this way.  It has been notable that the \nmailing lists relating to interlending (e.g. lis-ill@jiscmail.ac.uk) have been swamped in recent \nmonths with speculative requests for materials.  This is a development that has not been well \nreceived by some members of the list, although it perhaps underscores the increase in interlending \nstaffing time otherwise required to identify locations for supply outside of the BL. \nWith reductions to library funding the number of organisations able or offering to act as an \ninterlending source library may well diminish over the coming 12 months.  This has the potential to \ncause irreparable damage, not only to the local organisation but also to the ability of the UK sector \nto source non-locally available material.  At particular risk could be specialised local studies \ncollections held in regional libraries to which scholars may well now have to travel considerable \ndistance in order to obtain; let alone those overseas who will not be able to access the resources at \nall.  Many fear that a reduced ability to source interlending materials will reflect adversely on their \nown services, with a negative longer term impact on their demonstrable viability. \nCredit Crunching \nThe Comprehensive Spending Review (HM Treasury, 2010) has had impacts throughout the \ninterlending sector in the UK, with public libraries potentially the single worst hit. This decline in \nfunding is making all organisations carefully scrutinise their services and libraries are often seen as \na prime target for spending reductions.  For interlenders this is a worrying circumstance as only part \nof the service that is delivered is directly to patrons of the organisation; much of what makes a good \ninterlending service is the supply activity between libraries.   \n\u2022 \u201cWith the general reduction in budgets across all sectors I see ILL departments becoming \nmore marginalised. The service is already, in Public libraries, considered the 'poor relation' \nand with money being reduced in the book fund there could be less money for the ILL \nservice.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cSignificant lost expertise following redundancies and early retirement in the public sector - \nboth voluntary and enforced + redeployment to front line services.\u201d \nThis brings with it the spectre of job losses and reductions to, or even elimination of, services \ndeemed to be not cost-effective.  While the interlending sector will not be immune to potential staff \ncuts, voluntary severance or a recruitment freeze, what is evident is a fear that with the loss of \nindividuals is the loss of experience that goes with them as they depart.   \nMuch of value is built up through years of work in sourcing and supplying materials desired by \npatrons, knowing the locations to go to time and again or the people to approach.  Losing this \nknowledge can hobble a service far more than might be initially anticipated. \n\u2022 \u201cCutbacks in the public sector mean less stock is being purchased in academic and public \nlibraries.\u201d \n\u2022  \u201cThe fact that there is less money for book funds does mean that library members are \nrelying on the ILL service more to obtain the items that their service will no longer buy.\u201d \nAnd yet as acquisitions budgets are squeezed there is a greater need than ever to make use of the \ndistributed collections of libraries around the country, and further afield. Many respondents \ncommented that there is a need to highlight the incredible role that document supply provides in \nensuring when collection acquisition is reduced that access to resources can be maintained through \ntheir auspices. \n\u2022  \u201cLack of money (which has led us to impose stricter restrictions and hike charges in the last \n& next few months).\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cCuts in budget - potential full cost recovery of ILL passed on to borrowers.\u201d \nWhile there are alarming funding trends in the UK interlending sector today, there are rays of hope. \nFor example the offsetting or recouping of costs by acting as a source lender to other organisations \nis a unique service for many libraries. For many organisations today though they are re-examining \nother ways to self-finance their document supply service by charging patrons a nominal fee per \nrequest. While few if any pass on the real cost of obtaining an item, charges of between \u00a32-5 being \nthe apparent norm in the public sector currently, some are already reconsidering the levels they \ncharge in an effort to make the service increasingly less expensive. In the educational sector as well, \nlibrary funding reduction is also an issue, although for the most part not to such an alarming degree.  \n\u2022 \u201cFunding to interloan services is being cut which means we must increase our charges \neffectively creating a barrier to interloans. I expect use to fall for the first time in a number \nof years.\u201d \nWhile cost-neutrality for the interlending service is a laudable goal  it could be regarded by many \npatrons as a step too far. The impact on the perception of the service by users could make this an \nunpalatable step for many managers, but when contrasted with a potential removal of the service as \nan alternative may well be seen as a necessary evil. \nThe British Library \nThe British Library has not been immune to the reduction in funding (Brindley, 2010),  reflected in \ntheir \u201cdo more with less\u201d approach outlined in their five year strategy (British Library Board, \n2011b). \n\u2022 \u201cChanges in the British Library procedures and the introduction of the next pricing model \ncould make a significant impact on interlending in the next few years.\u201d \nAt the time of writing the charges for the coming year have not been formally announced but it has \nbeen mentioned at recent events that they are not expected to rise (Appleyard et al, 2011).  Indeed \nthere may even be some reduction in charges, which is very heartening.  Put alongside the BL\u2019s \nintention to develop their revenue streams, alongside maximising fiscal efficiencies this is worth of \nparticular note. \n\u2022 \u201cPotential of the new BLDSC ILL management system due to be unveiled next month.\u201d \nIn recent months the BL has announced a revision to its online interlibrary loan management \nsystem, which hopes to simplify the experience for interlending staff, and thus enhance the \nexperience for their patrons.  As this rolls out in later 2011 how much benefit this actually will offer \nthe community remains to be seen. \n\u2022 \u201cI wait to see how British Library's new library management software will impact on my \nwork. From the snippets I've heard so far I anticipate that it should allow me to check the \nstatus of requests myself without the need to contact customer services staff so it will allow \nme to check things directly before sending a formal \"chaser\" to BL.\u201d \nThe BL does seek to meet these challenges, exploring new media and new routes for delivery even \nin era decade of document supply decline.  It is likely that as their new modes of delivery or models \nof service come on stream they will remain the pre-eminent UK source of supply for the foreseeable \nfuture.  Although the commercial sector will bear watching in the coming months as others, \nincluding publishers themselves, test the market in offering direct delivery of documents to libraries \nand eyeing the interlending market with considerable interest. \n\u2022 \u201cMight be forced to investigate or utilise alternative methods of document delivery, eg: pay-\nto-view. At least one supplier allows you to buy credits and you can make these available to \nusers to buy pay-to-view access - this being cheaper than subscribing to some expensive \npackages or titles.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cI believe that subsidised pay-as-you-go document supply will become more important as \njournal subs are cut.\u201d \nDRM, Restrictions and Digital Documents \nFrom the survey and other recent community studies (North West Libraries, 2010)1\n\u2022 \u201cOverhauling copyright laws for the new digital world is desperately needed to aid ILLs. As \nis better electronic delivery, sans DRM.\u201d \n one of the \nbiggest single challenges to effective interlending in the UK is the restrictions placed on the loaning \nor supply from electronic journals and books.  \nIncreasingly library collections in both educational and other sectors are purchasing virtual resource \ncollections, which offer considerable advantages in storage costs and 24\/7 accessibility to local and \ndistance learners alike.  A consequence for the interlending sector is that these items are not as \nreadily loanable as printed materials.  Even for the major players like the BL the supply of these \nitems digitally must be as secure electronic documents, coupled with Digital Rights Management \n(DRM) packages to restrict the utility of the item to satisfy the business needs of the publisher, at \nthe expense of the end user. \n\u2022 \u201cThe documents we provide to patrons electronically are only electronic in their delivery - \nbecause of the strict DRM rules on most of the documents, patrons are unable to work with \nthem as electronic docs (ie save them, share them, download to mobile devices etc.) We have \nto recognise the way researchers and academics work and what they want from document \ndelivery.\u201d \nLicense for reuse terms set by publishers or individual suppliers are not standard when it comes to \ndocument supply, with considerable variation in what can be provided.  Some restrict to supply of \nprint only, while a handful allow the sharing of electronic resources; provided that a rigorous post-\nuse deletion regime is in place. However, for the majority of suppliers it was unclear or frustratingly \nambiguous to many respondents as to what the permissions allow in terms of interlending. \n\u2022 \u201cLicense agreements preventing access to electronic-only items held by other institutions \n[are an obstacle to interlending].\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cI am lucky in my institution that we have a digital rights management package and \nsomeone has carefully gone through all of our e-journal licences and has made a note of \nwhether we are permitted to supply articles to other libraries via ILL. A surprising number \nof licences do permit supply. \u201c \nUnlike the repository community which benefits from the SHERPA\/RoMEO tool (SHERPA, 2011) \nto clarify publisher policies for open access archiving there is no centrally maintained tool for \n                                                 \n1 Shortly available on the NWLIP and FIL websites, op cit \ndigital document interlending rights.  It seems that while some organisations maintain local lists of \npermissions or mount the details on an ERM system, the majority of interlending organisations have \na policy of not loaning items available virtually.  It seems the time or resource needed to maintain a \nqueryable permissions database is deemed to be something these services can ill afford.  If this \ntrend continues it will increasingly diminish the stock that can be loaned as digital collections grow. \nThis problem is certainly not unique to the UK community (Pavlovoic & Matutinovic, 2010).  This \nhas led to a sense of frustration from some within the community over those organisations that \nchoose, for whatever reason, not to loan. \n\u2022 \u201cIt is extremely frustrating to know that a number of Libraries hold a journal but as they do \nso electronically they will not supply the article. Many libraries still operate a blanket ban \non articles from journals held electronically and will not check their licences.\u201d \nHowever, the feeling from the community is that the DRM problem is one that needs to be \naddressed at a more strategic than operational level.  The belief is that there is a need for clear \ninterlending permissions to be enshrined in the supplier agreements that libraries sign upon \npurchase or subscription.  National organisations like the BL and the Forum for Interlending (FIL) \n(FIL, 2011), have noted that a relaxation in the currently restrictive licenses and DRM systems  \nwould be of significant benefit to the interlending community and library customers without \nsignificantly impacting on business stability.  It is hoped that other major library advocates will \nbecome involved in these efforts. \nAt the local level there is a need for document supply staff to be involved in discussions relating to \nso called \u201cbig deal\u201d acquisitions, especially as they relate to the ability to inhibit interlending. \nHowever, suggesting such an action and actually being in a position to engage with this debate at an \norganisational level is often not possible.  \nIt is hoped that the current independent review of the UK copyright laws (BBC, 2010; Intellectual \nProperty Office, 2010) will have some beneficial outcomes when it reports.  The review is slanted \ntowards business growth but it is to be hoped that the crucial underlying role of education is not \nignored; especially the supporting role interlending plays. \nOpening to Access \nIt was notable from the survey respondents that the use of open access materials as a resource for \nsatisfying requests was fairly low, although if this was from a lack of awareness was unclear.  The \nrole of the BL pilot EthOS ETD service (Ethos, 2011) was also cited by some as part of the \nreasoning for a decline in interlending requests.  However, some do see this as a route to supply and \nfor satisfying their patron base. \n\u2022 \u201cInstitutional repositories and the BL's Ethos service provide alternative, often free, access \nto PhD theses and journal articles. We make use of these where possible to supply our \nrequesters.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cEThOS. While not really interlending, EThOS does part of the job ILL librarians used to do \nin supplying theses. I like the way that theses are now made available to any interested party \nand think it a great step forward.\u201d \nIt is unclear from conversations with practitioners if the coming months and years will see \nrepositories and document supply services operate in tandem or in direct competition as sources of \nsupply; and may well be an area that would merit further study2\nThe use of open access journal articles (DOAJ, 2011), whether or not they are listed in local or \nnational union catalogues, was not an area the respondents felt important to mention.  This is \nperhaps a concern for the future of services and while doubtless there are some organisations that \nembrace the searching of these resources as part of their standard workflows or practices it is clearly \nnot widespread.  It remains a way in which even the most cash-poor interlending service can offer \nto retrieve scholarly works. \n. \nIt should be noted that repository based open access versions of published works are functionally \nequivalent to the final formally published versions; whereas those published within open access \njournals are the formally published versions.  For the vast majority of users, especially students, \nthese instantly accessible repository versions are more than sufficient to satisfy their scholastic \ndesires.  However, there will be a likely smaller group of users who will only be content with the \nfinal published work.  It is the role of the interlending services to explore with their end user \ncommunity just how much of their needs can be met with repository archived open access material, \nand how much must be the formally published variants; this would require another article to \ndiscuss. \nTechnology \nNew technologies usually advance far swifter into the user marketplace than they are adopted into \nlibraries.  For many in interlending the desire to introduce electronic signatures to comply with \ncopyright legislation is a yet unmet, but highly desired, dream.   \n\u2022 \u201cImplementation of electronic signatures for copyright declarations [should streamline and \nspeed up the document supply process]\u201d \n\u2022 \u201c[implement] electronic signatures - if it kills us!\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cElectronic signatures; secure electronic deliver have both helped to make the service \nquicker and more efficient.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cThe introduction of FileOpen at the British Library made it easier for us to introduce \nelectronic delivery to all our users.\u201d \nHowever, increasingly demands from users are for access to digitally delivered materials on a \nvariety of platforms and mobile devices. That some materials supplied with embedded DRM may \nnot open on some of these devices (FileOpen Systems Inc, 2011) is a serious problem for patrons \nand could be regarded as a serious failing of interlenders and library services to keep pace with \ncustomer demands.  In contrast to the previous Adobe Digital Editions secure electronic delivery \nplatform many respondents expressed a delight that the FileOpen DRM was far less intrusive and \ndisruptive for the end user experience. \n\u2022  \u201cSED - trying to implement the positives (speed of delivery) of this service and reduce the \nnegatives (access problems)\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cSED - not taking advantage yet as DRM technology employed still requires too much \ntechnical knowledge that we cannot necessarily support.\u201d \n                                                 \n2 It should noted that the author manages both interlending and open access repository services \n\u2022 \u201cSecure electronic delivery has been an important development - being able to supply \ndocuments direct from supplier to reader which speeds up the process and gives a more at \nyour desktop feel to the service - although DRM of the documents does mean this is not as \ngood as it could be.\u201d \nWhile challenging the use of restrictive DRM software was noted as desirable by many, it is not a \nrole to which individual libraries can rise.  However, the supply of secure electronic documents to \nthe desktop continues to remain a major satisfier for much of the interlending services' customer \ncommunities.  In time it could be hoped that this supply would enlarge to materials supplied not \nsimply by BL, CONARLS or even organisations like the BMA, but between interlending services\u2019 \nlibraries as well.  However, as noted above the restrictions of licenses may not allow this to be \npracticable or even legal for many for the foreseeable future, no matter how desirable it may be. \nForum for interlending & Collaborative Groupings \nFIL remains the most active and recognisable national membership body for organisations engaged \nwith document supply in the UK. At the core of FIL\u2019s function is the hosting and running of training \nand awareness events for interlending staff; often in combination with a visit to one of the British \nLibrary\u2019s principle centres (St Pancras, London and Boston Spa\u2019s Document Supply Centre; \nBLDSC).  \n\u2022 \u201cILL is the only area within the library world where I feel there is a great camaraderie as \nwe have a national and international willingness to help and share resources with our \ncolleagues and are always delighted to assist.\u201d \nThere have been some suggestions from interlending workers for FIL to take on more of an active \nrepresentative role with other stakeholders, such as publishers and suppliers. Given that FIL works \nin close liaison with the British Library, CONARLS and IFLA already, it should be noted that this \nalready happens to some degree.  As exponents of best practice in interlending such as reviewing \nIFLA guidelines, FIL remains a valuable body for reference and education for workers across the \nUK sector.  However, given some comments received, its functionality for some interlenders \nremains unclear. \nRegional groupings of interlending bodies such as the East Midlands (LIEM, 2011) and the North-\nWest Interlending Partnership (NWLIP, 2011) also help to facilitate the work of interlenders, and \npromote the exchange of resources, experiences and metric based data. Many survey respondents \nnoted the particular value they placed on these groupings in supporting their work as well as \nproviding a rich peer network to call upon.   \nIn particular it was noted that the cross-sectorality of these groups allowed for an exchange of \nexperience and advice from outside the traditional silo-ed sectors (e.g. public, academic, NHS).  \nAlongside reducing costs and, increasing electronic delivery it is this kind of collaborative activity \nthat may well offer the firmest foundation for future interlending activity.  At the very least these \nnetworks seem essential in providing a conduit of experience and support for those working within \nthe sector.  Outside of the UK the supply of items from libraries around the world through the IFLA \nscheme also remains relevant. \nAbove and beyond this the technologies, tools and services provided to enable this effective \ncollaboration (e.g. UnityUK) continue to be an area of special benefit to the sector. \n\u2022 \u201cUse of online ILL management tools such as UnityUk to manage ILLs electronically and \nfacilitate electronic e-applications \/ responses - this has significantly increased the speed of \nILLs.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cAvailability and use of COPAC & SUNCAT for satisfying requests.\u201d \n\u2022 \u201cCollective library catalogues such as InforM25 - used for location searches.\u201d \nThe Road Ahead \nAs Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor once opined \u201cThe future is not set, there is no fate but what we \nmake for ourselves.\u201d (Terminator 2, 1991).  She might have been facing down implacable killing \nmachines, but this is a self evident truth for all UK document supply service managers and staff \ntoday.  It is not a time for temerity it is a time to stand up and proudly demonstrate the metrics of \nsuccess that underlie their activities and ensure they have sufficient customer feedback to illuminate \nthe very real need for their services.  Only through promoting the what interlending  offering, the \ncost savings they deliver and the impact they have for the customer base, can they continue to be  an \nessential part of any serious UK library service infrastructure. \n\u2022 \u201cUsers are under more pressure to provide evidence to support work practices so there are \ngreat opportunities for the library to show that we can get just about anything.\u201d \nOne thing seems certain, interlending in the UK over the next few years is likely to operate in a very \ndifferent environment.  The financial crisis has brought many issues with interlending services to a \nhead, and it is without a doubt a time of challenge and change for everyone.  While the public sector \nstruggles with deep cuts to library budgets, education can hardly be said to be isolated from this \nalthough experience varies.   \nHowever, many interlenders I spoke to in preparation of this article affirmed an opportunistic view \nof this period.  It offers a chance, forced perhaps by necessity, to re-evaluate and re-prioritise the \nwork done by UK interlending staff and services. Their unique ability to rapidly source and deliver \nthe rare, the esoteric and the essential for local patrons is something that should be celebrated and \nmust be advocated to senior decisions makers. Interlending service managers need to be able to \ndemonstrate through robust metrics and genuine customer feedback the value added dimension their \nservices bring in satisfying their customer base and achieving key organisational goals.  It may be \nonly through this kind of proactive move that we can ensure that our services will continue to \ndeliver materials into this next decade. \nAcknowledgements \nWith especial thanks to those people working who took the time to comment and discuss issues and \nmatters around this work, respond to this survey or make comments, as well as the journal Editor, \nfor their multifarious inputs in the development of this article. \nReferences \n\u2022 Appleyard, A., Smith, B. and Troman, A.
