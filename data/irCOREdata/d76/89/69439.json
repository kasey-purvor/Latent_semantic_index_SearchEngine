Honary).a b s t r a c t\nSporadic-E is a problem in high latitude HF communications because of its irregular and as yet\nunpredictable behaviour. This paper characterises the change in E-layer critical frequency (foE) that\noccurs in the four hours following a storm sudden commencement (SSC) event which is a precursor to\nmagnetospheric storms which adversely affect ionospheric communications.\nFollowing checks for any seasonal or solar activity dependency in the data, further analysis\ndetermines the occurrence of full blanketing (screening) Sporadic-E layer formation at high latitudes as\nseen on vertical ionosondes in Northern Finland (671 Latitude). An appropriate threshold value of foE is\nproposed that could be used following the commencement of ionospheric storms, indicating that there\nis a high probability that F-layer screening will occur. As far as the authors are aware this is the first\nstatistical analysis of the onset of Sporadic-E following SSC.\n& 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. Introduction\nA significant problem in using any F-layer propagation mode at\nhigh latitudes is the large variability of this layer on the time scale\nof fractions of an hour in these regions. The F2-layer is known to\nhave significant variability at mid-latitudes, often exhibiting\nvariations of 1\u20132MHz in the MUF(3000) over less than 1h (Paul,\n1985). Although data on MUF(3000) variability at high latitudes is\nscarce, there are reasons to believe that the temporal variability\nfor this mode would be considerably greater at high latitudes than\nat mid-latitudes.\nOne of the most detrimental effects of Sporadic-E (Es) on HF\npropagation is the screening effect which occurs due to the\nsudden occurrence of an intense Es layer which prevents any\nsignal from penetrating the E-region and reaching the F-layer.\nFirstly this paper examines the variability that occurs in the\nE-layer, which causes significant deviations from expected median\nvalues as calculated by propagation prediction algorithms.\nSecondly this paper determines, by observation, an appropriate\nthreshold value of foE that indicates the onset of screening.\nEs is defined as an altitude-thin E-region layer at an\nunpredictable altitude and\/or an unexpected intensity (Mathews,\n1998). Historically the term \u2018\u2018Sporadic-E\u2019\u2019 derives from ionosonde\nobservations and from the beginning has been used to describe a\nvariety of E-region echoes from a variety of HF soundingll rights reserved.\nications Regulation (ComReg),\n.

The term \u2018\u2018sporadic\u2019\u2019 continues to pose semantic\ndifficulties in that the different classifications of Es display various\nlevels of periodicity and thus predictability. The most common\ncurrent definition of Es is simply that of an ionisation layer lying\nanywhere in the E-region.\nIn discussing Sporadic-E we must be very careful in the\nterminology used. In the literature the phrase \u2018\u2018Sporadic-E\u2019\u2019 is\napplied to different types of layers that form around the 100km\naltitude mark. For example, the evening Es and midnight Es are not\nthe intense, often blanketing E-layers dealt with in this report.\nBoth of these types of Es are thin layers and understood to be\ncaused by vertical wind shears and ionospheric electric fields\n(Wan et al., 1999).\n1.1. Causes of Es\nEs arises when clouds of intense ionisation occasionally form in\nthe E-region ionosphere. The most common theoretical explana-\ntion of the formation of Sporadic-E layers in low- and mid-\nlatitudes is the wind shear theory (e.g., Whitehead, 1961;\nMathews, 1998). According to this theory, ions are accumulated\ninto thin, patchy sheets by the action of high-altitude winds in the\nE-region ionosphere. Wind shear occurs at the boundary between\ntwo wind currents of different speed, direction, or both. For\nexample, two high-speed winds blowing approximately in\nopposite directions in the E-region ionosphere create a wind\nshear, which makes it possible to redistribute and compress\nionised particles into a thin layer.\nIt has also been suggested that the electric field alone can\nproduce Es layers (Nygre\u00b4en et al., 1984). This theory demands an\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nS.E. Ritchie, F. Honary \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 1353\u201313641354electric field pointing in a proper direction. Convincing evidence\nfor the electric field theory has been presented by Parkinson et al.\n(1998) who presented the number of observed Es layers versus\nelectric field direction at Antarctica and confirmed that this\ntheory is particularly effective at high latitudes where strong\nelectric fields are encountered. This theory leads to compressive\nvertical plasma flow if the ionosphere electric field points in some\ndirection betweenwest and north in the northern hemisphere and\nbetween west and south in the southern hemisphere. In their\ndetailed review, Kirkwood and Nilsson (2000) examined different\nhigh latitude thin layers comparing the wind shear and electric\nfield theories of layer formation, noting that a number of\nimportant questions remain unanswered.\nMore recently, Damatie et al. (2002) found evidence for the\npresence of vertical shears in the meridional E-region neutral\nwind as well as the right conditions for the electric field theory.\nUsing data from the SuperDARN radars they detected the presence\nof an ionospheric electric field pointing in the sector between\nwest and north. The conclusion is that both mechanisms may be\nactive simultaneously and that their relative importance remains\nunknown.\nKing (1962) inclines to the view that the ionisation moves\ndown from the F-region, however as the ionisation has to be\nreplaced at least every few hundred seconds (with the lowest\nrecombination coefficient acceptable) the whole of the F-region\nionisation would be depleted in a few hours.\nWhitehead (1970) suggested a three-stage phenomenon. First\nof all, we have ionisation by incoming particles. The dumping\nmechanism may itself be associated with magnetic activity.\nSufficient ionisation may be produced to give a plasma frequency\napproaching 2MHz in a thick layer. A second mechanism forms\nthis ionisation into irregularities with a plasma frequency\napproaching 10MHz (to account for the foEs observed on\nionograms), and possibly the same mechanism or a third one\ncauses the smaller irregularities for the VHF reflections.\nThe influence of geomagnetic disturbances on Es layers in\ngeneral has been investigated by a number of researchers\n(Whitehead, 1970, 1989; Majeed, 1982; Baggaley, 1984), where\nboth positive and negative correlations of Es with the geomagnetic\nactivity as well as the absence of correlation were revealed. They\nalso reported on the dependence of the Es layer response to the\ngeomagnetic disturbances on latitude, season, time of the day and\nthe type of Es layer. It appears that the question of the influence\nand prediction of geomagnetic disturbances on the Es layer has\nnot yet been solved completely.\nMaksyutin et al. (2001) performed an analysis of dependence\nof Es layer response to geomagnetic disturbances on the level of\nsolar activity and showed that during the years with a low level of\nsolar activity, the Es layer response to the geomagnetic dis-\nturbances was more pronounced than during the years with a\nhigh level of solar activity.\nHigh latitude Es layers are generally considered to be due to\nparticle precipitation (Buchau et al., 1972; Whitehead, 1970;\nWhalen et al., 1971; Wagner et al., 1973). Naridner et al. (1980)\nfound that electron precipitation usually is the major cause for\nthe formation of the high latitude Sporadic-E layer and that the\nmodified wind shear mechanism, which takes into account the\neffect of electric fields, is important under low electron precipita-\ntion conditions only.\nAt high latitudes most of the time the ionisation is dominated\nby energetic charged particles (electrons or protons) and only\nrarely is the ionosphere \u2018\u2018quiet\u2019\u2019, i.e. it varies with solar zenith\nangle and solar activity (Friedrich, 2002). It is acknowledged that\nat high latitudes the sun is able to produce an E layer when it is\nabove the horizon. However, ionisation can also be produced in\nthe same altitude range by the precipitation of energetic particles,principally electrons which then dominate and control the\ncharacteristics of the E-layer. For example, in the course of a\nsubstorm, precipitation of charged particles from the magneto-\nsphere into the ionosphere takes place, the electrojet is increased,\nthe substorm current wedge system is formed and the electron\ndensity and composition of the ionosphere are changed (Buon-\nsanto, 1999). It is known that during the substorm growth phase,\naccelerated particles from the solar wind can penetrate through\nthe entry layer of the magnetosphere into the auroral ionosphere\n(Blagoveshchensky and Borisova, 2000), often causing intense Es\nlayers.1.2. Storm sudden commencement\u2014the link to Es\nAn interplanetary disturbance in the solar wind such as shock\nwaves and dynamic pressure pulses (Wilken et al., 1982; Tsurutani\net al., 1995; Takeuchi et al., 2002), when impinging on the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere, compresses it and increases the magnetopause\ncurrent. This leads to a change in the low-latitude ground-based\ngeomagnetic field intensity, lasting typically for some tens of\nminutes. These signatures in the geomagnetic H-field, seen\nsuddenly and simultaneously at ground magnetic observatories\n(Rastogi et al., 2001), are called storm sudden commencements\n(SSC) or sudden impulses (SI), depending on whether a magneto-\nspheric storm is initiated or not.\nThe International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy\n(IAGA) collates widespread observatory magnetometer data in\norder to compile a list of agreed SSC events (Ebro, 2009). Burlaga\nand Ogilvie (1969), Gosling et al. (1967) and Ogilvie et al. (1968)\nhave shown the good correlation between these impulsive\nchanges in solar wind parameters and SSC signatures in the\nmagnetosphere or on the ground. The same researchers as well as\nHirshberg et al. (1970) demonstrated that SCC events are caused\nby hydromagnetic shock waves and tangential discontinuities in\nthe solar wind interacting with the magnetosphere. The SSC\ngenerated by these hydromagnetic shock waves transform the\nmagnetosphere into a new compressed steady state configuration,\nwhich is in balance with the increased solar wind pressure\n(Wilken et al., 1982, 1986; Tamao, 1964, 1975).\nCollis and Haggstrom (1991) studied the response of the high\nlatitude ionosphere to an SSC. Their results show that an increase\nin E-region electron density at the time of the SSC is not caused\nby an influx of ionisation from higher altitude layers and is not\ndue to a sudden inflow of ionisation from the equator. The sudden\nE-region enhancement in this study is therefore more likely\ndue to a sudden and sustained dumping of high-energy particles,\nas a result of the SSC, causing enhanced Es layer ionisation.\nThe onset of intense Es following an SSC just after midnight and\nlasting up to 12h has been noted by Herman and Penndorf (1963).\nIn this particular case foE reached 12MHz and the Es layer covered\nmost of North America above 401N within two hours of the SSC.\nOther observations (Batista et al., 1991; Morton and Mathews,\n1993) have also shown that during large geomagnetic storms, the\nelectron density of the lower ionosphere increased significantly\ncompared to quiet conditions.2. Data gathering\nThe data used in this report are gathered from f-plots\ngenerated at the Sodankyla\u00a8 observatory, which is located 120km\nnorth of the Arctic Circle in Finland, 671220N, 261380E, L-value 5.2.\nData for this research work were gathered over six years from\nthe sunspot minimum in 2000 until the near sunspot maximum\nin 2006.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nS.E. Ritchie, F. Honary \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 1353\u20131364 1355The daily f-plot reveals on an hourly basis frequency\ncharacteristics of a full day\u2019s ionograms using an internationally\nagreed convention, so that detailed observations from different\nstations may be compared efficiently. The f-plot provides a\nsummary of the original observations with the minimum of\ninterpretation and enables difficult decisions on the true values of\nionospheric parameters, needed for hourly tabulations, to be\nmade with due consideration of all the available data. This is\nparticularly important at high latitude stations where blackouts,\nspread echoes or rapidly changing oblique reflections frequently\nobscure the normal characteristics from being observed on\nindividual hourly ionogram records. It has been acknowledged\nthat the f-plot is a valuable tool for identifying variations in the\nionosphere, in the interpretation of complex records, particularly\nat high latitudes and it has become a primary tool for analysing\nthe hour-to-hour or day-to-day changes in the ionosphere (Piggott\nand Rawer, 1972).\nThe starting point for this study is the occurrence of an SSC,\nwhich denotes an increase in low-latitude magnetic intensity,\nwhich typically lasts for tens of minutes and then is followed by a\nmagnetic storm or by an increase in geomagnetic activity lasting\nat least one hour, i.e., a period of ionospheric disturbances and\ncorresponding variability in ionospheric communications. In\nusing the IAGA database of SSC events the occurrence of\nmagnetospheric changes and modifications to the ionosphere (a\ndisturbed state) is guaranteed. This is done in preference to the\nstandard use of the Kp value, which as a three hourly index does\nnot provide the resolution required for this investigation. In order\nto identify data that capture all the E-layer effects that are\ninitiated with an SSC occurring, data are analysed for the four\nhours following SSC.\nFor each of the four hours following an SSC, the following\nstatistics are collected for each sector from the f-plot generated atFig. 1. Aggregated line, scatter and bar plot covering all four hours following SSC. The\nm\u0002n denotes the hour of measurement.the Sodankyla\u00a8 observatory. The mean, median, minimum, max-\nimum, lower quartile and upper quartile of the change in critical\nfrequency (DfoE) that occur in each sector, the percentage of\nscreening (total blanketing) that occurs in each sector and the\ncritical frequency of the E-layer (foE) at which screening occurs.\nThe difference in critical frequency measured on each hour\nfollowing an SSC event is used to define the variability that occurs.\nThis difference is designated in this paper as DfoEn\u2013mwhere DfoE is\nthe change in hourly E-layer critical frequency and n and m\nindicate which hour following the SSC is being measured. These\nvalues reflect the reduction or increase in E-layer ionisation due to\nall applicable factors. However as enhanced ionisation due to\nparticle precipitation which is by far the dominant ionisation\nsource (see Section 1.1), DfoEn\u2013m captures predominantly the\ninfluence of particle precipitation.\nBearing in mind that the f-plot accumulates hourly data, the\ncritical frequency of the E-layer is noted on the hour before the\nSSC occurs (called FoE0). The same information is then gathered on\nthe hour following the SSC (denoted as DfoE0\u20131) and every hour\nthere after for four hours (DfoE1\u20132 to DfoE3\u20134).2.1. Discounting solar control\nThe E-layer is generally considered to be under the control\nof solar radiation because in many low-latitude ionograms the\nE-layer regularly forms as the sunrise reaches 100km altitude and\nbegins to fade as sunset falls below 100km altitude. There is also a\nvery strong correlation between sunspot number, as a measure of\nsolar activity, and the critical frequency of the E-layer at low- and\nmid-latitudes (Smith, 1957, 1962). It is easy to see that this\nassumption has limited applicability at high latitudes in disturbed\nconditions during which the E-layer is modified extensively byabscissa is monthly sunspot count in bins of 20 and the ordinate is DfoEm\u2013n where\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nS.E.

As shown by Baron (1974) and\nHinteregger et al. (1965) the ionisation produced by particle\nprecipitation is two orders of magnitude greater than that\nproduced by photo-ionisation. Intense precipitation is therefore\nthe dominant mechanism affecting the high latitude ionosphere,\nespecially during magnetic disturbances. This removes most if not\nall solar and seasonal control concerns and reflects the conclu-\nsions of a number of researchers, e.g. Hargreaves (1992),\nMcNamara (1991), Davies (1990), etc.Fig. 2.

The behaviour of DfoE across the first four hours is\nsimilar to the behaviour of DfoE when each hour is examined in\nisolation. The scatter plot with dropped vertical lines in the top\npanel of Fig. 1 details the number of measurements covered in\neach bin.\nTwo general observations are made on the change that occurs\nin the four hours following an SSC. First is that there is no\ndistinctive pattern of change in the median value of DfoEm\u2013n assolar activity increases; there is a slight increase when the\nmonthly sunspot number (MSN) exceeds 140, but this is\ninconclusive as there is a similar increase at very low MSNs.\nSecond is that there is a reduction in the overall variability of\nDfoEm\u2013n as solar activity increases. At high values of MSN greater\nthan 100, the variability is significantly reduced. The two\nconverging lines in Fig. 1 merely indicate the decreasing trend in\noverall variability, i.e. a reduction in the variability of DfoEs as\nsolar activity increases. Even when discounting the two upper\nbins with a low count (covering MSC of 140\u2013180), the decrease in\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nS.E. Ritchie, F. Honary \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 1353\u201313641358variability with increasing monthly sunspot count is evident. The\nreason for this reduction in variability is not clear but it confirms\nthe findings of Maksyutin et al. (2001) who performed an analysis\nof the dependence of Es layer response to geomagnetic dis-\nturbances on the level of solar activity. They showed that during\nthe years with a low level of solar activity the Es layer response to\nthe geomagnetic disturbances was more pronounced than during\nthe years with a high level of solar activity.\nWhile the widest variability in foE does occur at high values of\nsolar activity (MSC of 80\u2013100) the median change in critical\nfrequency at all four hours does not appear to have any solar\ndependency.Fig. 3.

The bottom panel in Fig. 3 has an expanded ordinate\naxis showing in fine detail the median variation in E-layer critical\nfrequency.\nDuring the first hour following an SSC there is a greater\nvariability of DfoE in summer and autumn than in winter and\nspring (1st panel of Fig. 2). In the first and second hour (Fig. 2\u20141st\nand 2nd panel) the median value of foE is elevated in winter but\nthis is not the case in the third and fourth hour. Overall the\nvariability of DfoE (top panel of Fig. 3) does not appear to have any\nseasonal dependency when viewed across all hours.3.3. The variability of Es\nExtremely wide variations in ionospheric electron density\nprofiles at auroral latitudes have been documented (Bates andFig. 4.

Baron (1974) demonstrated the considerable\nvariability of the E-region, in terms of electron density, between\nindividual incoherent scatter radar scans only 20 s apart with\nionisation extending down to relatively low altitudes of approxi-\nmately 80\u201385km. Incidentally, this altitude information implies\nthat the precipitating electrons that produced the ionisation were\nfairly energetic, having energies in the order of 20 keV.\nThis section examines, in some detail, the variability of Es in\nthe four hours following an SSC and particular attention is given to\nthe occurrence of screening. In order to accumulate an adequate\nnumber of samples the day was split into four sectors. Sector A\ncovering the period 0\u20136 MLT, sector B covering 6\u201312 MLT, sector C\ncovering 12\u201318 MLT and sector D covering 18\u201324 MLT.

Honary \/ Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 71 (2009) 1353\u20131364136025% and 75% percentiles between vertical error bars and the count\nof events in the lower panel.\nThe statistics show considerable variation, as is expected when\nworking with the ionosphere in general and which is amplified\nwhen dealing with the high latitude ionosphere. A number of\nsignificant points are noted from examining the panels of Fig. 4. It\nis noted that DfoE0\u20131 can be positive or negative, which depends\non whether or not storm-induced precipitation has commenced in\nthis hour or not. Full blanketing (screening) can occur even when\nDfoE0\u20131 is negative. This implies that the F-layer ionisation has\ndramatically reduced; hence, even though the E-layer might be\npenetrated, no F-layer reflecting plane exists. Screening can occur\nwhen DfoE0\u20131 is zero and this implies that F-layer ionisation is\nseverely reduced or particle precipitation is maintaining a thick\nhighly ionised Es layer.\nIn the first hour following SSC when DfoE0\u20131 exceeds 2.1MHz\nthe onset of screening is guaranteed. Screening occurs in all\nsectors in the first hour (DfoE0\u20131) except between 6 and 12 MLT\n(sector B) where only one out of 33 events over a six-year period\ncaused screening in the first hour. Screening occurs extensively inthe second hour when DfoE1\u20132 exceeds 1MHz and exclusively\nwhen DfoE1\u20132 exceeds 2.1MHz, identical to what occurs in the first\nhour (DfoE0\u20131).\nIn the third hour DfoE2\u20133E2.1MHz continues to be a milestone\nindicator that guarantees screening will occur, with only one\nexception occurring in six years of data. The extensive occurrence\nof screening greatly increases in the third hour when DfoE2\u20133\nexceeds 0.5MHz, which is significantly less than in previous\nhours.\nIn the fourth hour DfoE3\u20134E3MHz is now a new milestone\nindicator that guarantees screening will occur. The extensive\noccurrence of screening at negative values of DfoE3\u20134 in the fourth\nhour indicates that F-layer ionisation has dramatically reduced\nand that there is no F-layer reflecting plane even if the E-layer is\npenetrated. In this hour a DfoE3\u20134E2.1MHz again provides a good\nthreshold with screening occurring exclusively in sectors C and D\nabove this level.\nRing currents during magnetic storms move the auroral region\n(at the poleward boundary of the trapping region toward the\nequator) and all field lines from the auroral zone touch the outer\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nS.E.

Likelihood of the occurrence of screening\nThe histogram in Fig. 5 captures all DfoEm\u2013n data points binned\nagainst the hour (in MLT) in which the SSC occurred. Each bar\ncovers all the data points that occur in each hour. The lower\ndivision of the bar (unshaded portion) shows the number of data\npoints that did not screen the upper layers and the top division of\neach bar (shaded portion) shows the number of data points for\nwhich screening of the upper layers did occur. The scatter plot\nwith dropped horizontal lines on the top of the histogram reflects\nthe percentage blanketing that is represented by the division of\neach stacked bar.\nThe histogram shows a clear increase in blanketing events\nbetween 16:00 and 3:00 MLT, i.e. early evening, through midnight\nto the early morning hours. From 19 to 3 MLT there is a 50%\nchance of screening to occur. This rises as high as 80% in the hour\nbetween 21 and 22 MLT. This reflects the local times at Sodankyla\u00a8\nwhen the field lines are open to direct particle injection. TheFig. 5. Histogram (bottom panel) capturing all DfoE data points binned against the hour\npanel) reflects the percentage blanketing that is shown by the division of each histogrlikelihood of screening between 3 and 14 MLT is below 20% and\nincreases in the hours up to 19 MLT.\n3.5. The threshold of screening\nSince the worldwide study undertaken by Smith (1957) the\noccurrence of Es has been linked to the value of foE exceeding\n5MHz and since then this threshold has been used extensively in\nthe literature when studying the long-term statistics of monthly\nmedian values.\nMatsushita and Reddy (1967) examined the average daytime\nbehaviour of mid-latitude blanketing Es on a worldwide basis,\nusing fbEs greater than 2MHz. It must be noted that the blanketing\nreferred to in this paper must not be confused with screening,\nwhich describes total blanketing. Blanketing (fbEs) describes what\nis seen on an ionogramwhen the F-layer is only partially screened\nat lower frequencies\u2014typically around 1.4\u20132.2MHz. Screening\ndescribes what is seen on an ionogram when none of the F-layer\ncan be discerned. This reflects the situation where no mitigation\ntechnique, e.g. reducing or increasing frequency or the modifica-\ntion of take-off angles, can achieve access to the F-layer.\nFig. 6 captures the median values of f0Es at which screening\noccurs in each sector across the six hours following SSC, i.e. the\ncritical frequency of the E-layer at which screening of the F-layer\noccurs. The count of the number of screening events in each sector\nis shown in the lower panel. The fitted straight line provides an(in MLT) in which the SSC occurred.

The fitted\nstraight line merely shows the increasing trend in median values.\nIn the hour following SSC a critical E-layer frequency from\n2.6MHz upward can indicate that screening has occurred. Up to\nsix hours after the SSC this value has increased to between 4 and\n5MHz depending on sector.\nIt is clear from Fig. 6 that foEZ5MHz and foEZ2MHz are not\nappropriate values to indicate screening has occurred. Using\nfoEZ5MHz would have resulted in missing the vast majority of\nblanketing events that occurred over the six-year period of this\nstudy. A value of foEZ2MHz is far too low and drastically over-\nindicates the number of screening events. In establishing a typical\nvalue of screening, we must if possible take into account the\ninfluence that local time has on the value of screening foE as well\nas to account for the significant variation we see in the data.\nFig. 7 shows how important it is to include local time as well as\nthe absolute value of foE (not average or median values) with\nwhatever screening threshold level is used. The ordinate axis in\nthe top panel is the percentage of screening events that occurred\nwhich exceed three foE thresholds in each sector. The ordinate axis\nof the lower panel is the count of the number of events in the six-\nyear period of this study. The abscissa for both panels is the sector\nin which the SSC occurred. It must be mentioned that sectors A\nand B have the lowest occurrence of SSC and statistics are\ntherefore based on a small sample of events in these two sectors.\nUsing 50% occurrence as a lower limit, a threshold of 4MHz\n(solid dots\u2014K) is inadequate in sector A and barely adequate in\nsector B. A threshold of 3.5MHz (open dots\u2014J) has similar\ninadequacies in sectors A and B. A threshold of 3MHz (solid\ninverted triangles\u2014.) is far more appropriate as a measure in all\nbut sector B. In sector A, 76% of blanketing foE exceeds 3MHz; this\nfalls in sector B to 53%, rising to 82% in sector C and to 90%\nin sector D.\nWhile the proposed threshold of foEsZ3MHz lacks accuracy in\nsector B, it is a value of E-layer critical frequency that favourably\nindicates screening of the ionospheric layers above the E-layer in\nthe hours following an SSC.4. Conclusions\nEs has different characteristics in different latitudinal zones\nand there may be several mechanisms governing the behaviour of\nthese layers. The high latitude Es layers are generally considered to\nbe due to particle precipitation (Buchau et al., 1972; Whitehead,\n1970; Whalen et al., 1971; Wagner et al., 1973). Naridner et al.\n(1980) found that electron precipitation usually is the major cause\nfor the formation of the high latitude Sporadic-E layer and that the\nmodified wind shear mechanism, which takes into account the\neffect of electric fields, is important under low electron precipita-\ntion conditions only.\nEs layers are important to consider at high latitudes where they\nare almost always present and frequently of sufficient ionisation\nto totally reflect radio waves in the 3\u201310MHz range at vertical\nincidence. There are also occasions when total blanketing occurs,\ni.e., periods when the layers above the E-layer are completely\nscreened off. When this occurs the mode of propagation for a\nshort-range HF link is limited to a one or two hop Es path, even at\nfrequencies far greater than 10MHz which would normally\npenetrate the E-layer.\nThis paper details the deviation of foEs (from its quiet-\nionosphere value) for the four hours immediately following the\nSSC and establishes a threshold of deviation that predicts\nthe onset of fully blanketing Es in the four hours following anSSC. The methodology of using the occurrence of SSC as the\nstarting point of each investigation ensures a well defined and\nunderstood starting point from which to gather data and examine\nthe magnitude and variance of expected disturbances to the E-\nlayer. While the proposed threshold of screening, fsEsZ3MHz,\nlacks accuracy in sector B (6\u201312 MLT) when there are very few\noccurrences of screening, it is a value of E-layer critical frequency\nwhich favourably indicates screening of the ionospheric layers\nabove the E-layer in the four hours following an SSC.\nIt is seen from Fig. 4 that following the SSC the critical\nfrequency of the Es layer increases above the norm. This will\nadversely affect the operation of HF radio-communication\nsystems used at high latitudes unless corrective action is taken\nas these Es modes have different frequency\/ground range\ndependencies from the F2 mode. This phenomenon known as\n\u2018\u2018E-layer cut off\u2019\u2019 (Davies, 1965) is significant in high latitude\nregions because any frequency that penetrates the Es layer at a\ngiven point to reach the F-layer is also close to the maximum\nuseable frequency (MUF) of the F2-layer at its point of incidence\nwith that layer. Partially reflecting Es can cause serious multipath\nand mode interference, especially detrimental to data transmis-\nsion systems.\nA second compelling reason for unreliable F2 mode propagation\nat high latitude is the possibility of complete blockage (or screening)\nof the F-layer by Es as shown in Fig. 5. Such an enhanced layer of Es\nwould augment the power in a signal propagated at a frequency\nbelow the E-layer MUF. For example, a highly ionised patch of Es\nmay make F2-layer propagation impossible but may also contribute\nto a low-loss reflection point on an E mode propagation path thus\nenhancing that mode\u2019s signal quality.\nWhile these characteristics can be helpful or harmful to radio\ncommunications, either type of Es (i.e., partially blanketing and\nfull blanketing) may extend the useful frequency range and its\npresence can be effectively used in system design and operations\nif it is understood (Lane, 2001). Of course for the Es mode path to\nbe successfully used, the antenna at both the receiver and\ntransmitter must have a suitable radiation pattern with sufficient\ngain to take advantage of the different range of transmission\nangles required to achieve the same ground range as an F-layer\nusing an Es layer reflection path.\nFollowing an SSC event or during magnetic storms, one rational\napproach toward using the ionosphere for HF communications in\nhigh latitude regions is to rely solely on E-layer modes, i.e. to fully\nutilise the enhanced E-layer. From an operational point of view a\ntechnique is needed to address the uncertainties generated by\nionospheric disturbances on key ionospheric parameters and a\nnumber of authors have proposed, for example, the use of oblique\nand vertical sounding data to provide near real-time ionospheric\nmaps and communication performance parameters (e.g., Zolesi\net al., 2004; Goodman and Ballard, 1999). Certainly while each of\nthese approaches has different applications and merits, the\nauthors have chosen another approach. The use of propagation\nprediction programs to establish, in advance, the choice of\noperating frequency is still the basis of many operations and is\ngood enough for operational purposes during quiet conditions.\nThe problem to be overcome is to determine what propagation\nparameters need to be modified during disturbed conditions, i.e.,\nwhat consequential modifications need to be made to the\ncommunications system to ensure some form of continued\noperation during disturbed conditions.\nThis investigation into disturbances affecting the E-region has\nled to the characterisation of the change in the value of the critical\nfrequency of Es and the occurrence of fully blanketing Es following\nan SSC. The strength of this approach is that system operators can\nadjust for the deviation of critical frequencies from the quiet-\nionosphere predictive norm following SSC and the onset of storms,\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nS.E.
