INTRODUCTION\nThe systematic behavior of the structure of neutron-rich\nnuclei with N > 50 in the mass A \u2248 90 region, not far from\nthe closed shell N = 50, is important to better understand the\nevolution of this shell gap as a function of proton number.\nHowever, for many of the nuclei in this region, information\non the medium-high spin levels is scarce because of the diffi-\nculty reaching them via stable beam\/target fusion-evaporation\nreactions. However, recent studies have shown that nuclei in\nthis region can be studied by \u03b3 -ray spectroscopy in heavy-ion\nmultinucleon transfer reactions: the N = 50 isotones [1] and\nthe Se isotopes [2,3].\nIn the past decade there has been an increased interest in\nusing quasielastic and deep-inelastic processes to populate and\nstudy a wide range of both projectile-like and target-like nuclei.\nTo deduce the level scheme of a particular nucleus for which\nno \u03b3 transitions are previously known, one must first assign\nunambiguously transitions to the nucleus of interest that can be\nused as starting points in the construction of the level scheme\nby using the \u03b3 \u03b3 coincidence technique (triple coincidences\nare preferable in case of a large number of \u03b3 -rays emitted\nin the reaction). In the present work, the first unambiguous\nassignments of transitions in the nuclei of interest were made\nin multinucleon transfer reaction experiments on thin targets\nwhere the recoiling ions were identified with good resolu-\ntion using a large-acceptance spectrometer and coincidences\nbetween the recoil nuclei and the emitted \u03b3 rays were also\nrecorded. However, in such experiments, the statistics of\nthe double or triple \u03b3 -ray coincidences are generally not\nenough for coincidence analysis and, consequently, another\nexperiment using a multidetector \u03b3 -ray array and a thick\ntarget is necessary to achieve sufficient statistics in triple\n\u03b3 -ray coincidences. The correlated analyses of the final results\nobtained in such a combination of experiments lead in the\ncurrent work to the identification of the previously unknown\npositive-parity yrast structures of the N = 52 nucleus 89Rb\nand the N = 53, 54 nuclei 92,93Y.\nThe 89Rb nucleus was studied previously using \u03b2\u2212-decay\n[4] and the (\u03b1, p) reaction [5] in which low-spin states were\ndetermined, with most of the states having limits for the spin\nvalue (see also the ENSDF evaluation [6]). The 92Y nucleus\nwas previously studied by \u03b2\u2212decay [7] and the (d, \u03b1) reaction\n[8] (see also the ENSDF evaluation [9]). As a result, states with\nrelatively low spins are known in this nucleus. In a similar\nway, low-spin levels in the 93Y nucleus were studied using\n\u03b2 decay [10] and isomeric transition (IT) decay [11], as well\nas by transfer reactions with light projectiles (d,3He) [12] and\n(p, \u03b1) [13] (see also the ENSDF evaluation [14]). The results\nof the present experiments complement the existing data with\ninformation on medium-high spin levels. A comparison of\nthe experimental results with shell-model calculations is also\npresented.\n0556-2813\/2007\/76(6)\/064301(10) 064301-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nD. BUCURESCU et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 064301 (2007)\nII. EXPERIMENTS\nA. Quasielastic and deep-inelastic reactions\nTwo experiments were performed using beams accelerated\nby the combination of the XTU Tandem and the supercon-\nducting LINAC ALPI accelerators at the Laboratori Nazionali\ndi Legnaro. The first reaction was a 590 MeV 90Zr beam of\napproximately 2 pnA on a 300 \u00b5g\/cm2 208Pb target deposited\nonto a 20 \u00b5g\/cm2 C backing, whereas the second reaction was a\n505 MeV 82Se beam of 4\u20136 pnA on a 400 \u00b5g\/cm2 238U target\nwith a 20 \u00b5g\/cm2 C backing. The projectile-like ions were\ndetected and identified with the PRISMA spectrometer [15]\nplaced close to the laboratory frame grazing angle (56\u25e6 for\nthe first reaction and 64\u25e6 for the second reaction, respectively)\nand having an opening of about 80 msr. In both cases, the\n\u03b3 rays were detected with the CLARA array [16]. Coinci-\ndences between the recoils and \u03b3 rays and between the \u03b3 rays\nwere recorded in event mode and then processed off-line.\nThis technique allows unique assignment \u03b3 -ray transitions\nto particular nuclei by identifying the mass and atomic number\nof the reaction products detected in PRISMA. The mass\nspectra of the identified Rb (Z = 37) and Y (Z = 39) isotopes\nobserved in the two reactions are displayed in Fig. 1, where\na clear separation of different species is demonstrated. In\nthe 90Zr+Pb reaction, the nuclei studied in this work were\nmainly populated in multinucleon transfer processes [17,18],\nwhereas in the 82Se+U reaction there was also an important\ncontribution from fission, as expected.\nThe coincidence relationships between the \u03b3 -ray transitions\nand the recoil nuclei were first investigated to associate un-\nambiguously certain \u03b3 -ray transitions with the de-excitations\nof the nuclei of interest. To construct the level schemes of\nthese nuclei, \u03b3 -\u03b3 coincidences (double or triple) are necessary,\nwhich are not provided with sufficient statistics by the thin\ntarget experiments with the CLARA-PRISMA setup. We have\ntherefore used a different set of \u03b3 \u03b3 coincidence data (acquired\nFIG. 1.

Thick target experiment\nThe experiment used here has been described in a number\nof previous articles, for example, Refs. [2,3,19]. It was initially\ndesigned as a multinucleon transfer reaction experiment using\na 470 MeV 82Se beam on a 50-mg\/cm2-thick 192Os target with a\n0.2-mm-thick Ta backing. The nuclei of interest for the present\nwork were populated mainly in deep-inelastic processes and\npossibly, as described in Ref. [20], via the fusion-evaporation\nreactions of the 82Se beam with the 16O contaminant of the\noxidized target.\nIn this experiment, the reaction \u03b3 rays were detected\nwith the GASP array [21]. In the off-line processing of the\ndata, in addition to the regular two- and three-dimensional\nsymmetrized \u03b3 -coincidence matrices, a number of asymmetric\nmatrices were constructed to extract information on the multi-\npolarity of the transitions. The asymmetric \u03b3 \u03b3 coincidence\nmatrices were sorted so that the energy signals from all\ndetectors were histogrammed onto one axis and those from\na specific ring of detectors at a given angle were counted along\nthe other axis. Gating on the all-detector axis, the resulting\nspectra have the angular distribution (ADO) information\n064301-2\n\u03b3 -RAY SPECTROSCOPY OF THE NEUTRON-RICH . . .

Typical RADO\nvalues in this configuration are about 0.7 and 1.30 for pure\ndipole and quadrupole multipolarities, respectively.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. The 89Rb nucleus\nThe \u03b3 rays observed in coincidence with the 89Rb mass\npeak (Fig. 1) are shown in the two upper panels of Fig. 2.\nThe spectra observed in the two reactions show essentially\nthe same \u03b3 rays. Strong \u03b3 rays at 809.0, 836.0, 1192.3, and\n1573 keV (the last one is not currently placed in the level\nscheme) are the best candidates for the yrast transitions in\nthis nucleus. The 221.0 keV \u03b3 ray, also clearly seen in both\nreactions, is the previously reported (5\/2)\u2212 \u2192 3\/2\u2212 (g.s.)\ntransition [6]. In the 82Se+U reaction spectrum, shown in the\nmiddle panel of Fig. 2, other previously reported transitions\nwith energies of 197.9, 411.5, and 586.0 keV, which originate\nfrom the low-energy states [6] can be observed with weak\nintensities.\nThe relationships between \u03b3 rays were studied using a triple\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 coincidence cube from the 82Se+16O reaction. The \u03b3 rays\ndetected as having weak intensities in the spectra gated by the\nrecoiling ions were confirmed to form the low-energy level\nscheme reported in Ref. [6] up to the Ex = 1195.4 keV level.\nThe strong 809.0, 836.0, and 1192.3 keV \u03b3 -rays were found\nto form a cascade that feeds the 1195.4 keV level. The fact\nthat the transitions below this level (198, 221, 412 keV) are\nseen with weaker intensities in coincidence with the recoils\nsuggests that the lifetime of the 1195.4 keV level is of the\norder of a few nanoseconds, comparable to the time intervals\nneeded by the recoils to fly out of the central spatial region,\nviewed by the CLARA array (note that the 974 keV transition\nfrom this level is not visible in these spectra due to its lower\ndetection efficiency\u2014a factor of about 3 lower than that of\nthe 221 keV transition). The lowest panel shown in Fig. 2 is a\ntriple \u03b3 -coincidence spectrum obtained by setting double gates\non the 197.9 keV \u03b3 ray and any of the 809.0 or 836.0 keV\n\u03b3 rays. The level scheme established for 89Rb is shown in\nFig. 3 and information concerning the observed \u03b3 -ray transi-\ntions are given in Table I.\nOf particular interest is the spin-parity of the Ex =\n1195.4 keV level. In the ENSDF database, it was reported\nas having a spin (\u00017\/2) [6]. However, by corroborating the\npresent data with older information, we have arguments that\nthis state has J\u03c0 = 9\/2+. First, one can observe that by using\nthe multipolarities deduced from ADO ratios and presented\nin Table I, one may assign spins of (7\/2), (7\/2), and (9\/2)\nto the states at 586.0, 997.5, and 1195.4 keV, respectively.\nThe previous assignment J \u0001 7\/2 in Ref. [6] seems to be\nmainly based on the fact that a weak branch of its decay\nto the 3\/2\u2212 (g.s.) was reported. Nevertheless, it was pointed\nout that the large log f t value of 7.78(15) of its \u03b2 decay\nfeeding from the 3\/2(+) ground state of 89Kr [4,6] disfavors\n064301-3\nD. BUCURESCU et al.

Level scheme of 89Rb as obtained from the current work.\nUp to the 1195.4 keV state, the level scheme coincides with that\ndetermined in previous studies [6]. Note the (9\/2+) assignment for\nthe 1195.4 keV state, which is a short-lived isomer (lifetime of a few\nns, see text). For information on the \u03b3 -ray transitions, see Table I.\nthe 7\/2+ assignment. However, this state was populated by\nan \u0005 = (3, 4) transferred angular momentum in the (\u03b1, p)\nreaction [5], therefore it may be a 9\/2+ level. Note also that\nthe estimation given above for the lifetime of the 1195-keV\nlevel (several nanoseconds) is in agreement with an M2 type\nfor the 974 keV transition. The strong population of this state\nthrough the 809\u2013836\u20131192 keV cascade is another argument\nin favor of the assignment of this cascade to the positive\nparity yrast cascade built on the expected 9\/2+ state in this\nnucleus when the unpaired proton is excited in the g9\/2 orbital.\nFigure 4 shows the evolution of both the excitation energy of\nthe 9\/2+ state (taken with respect to the lowest 3\/2\u2212 state\nin all nuclei), and of the 13\/2+ \u2192 9\/2+ transition energy\nwith the number of neutrons in the Rb isotopes. The latter\nvaries, as expected, like the 2+ \u2192 0+ transition energy in the\nneighboring even-even Sr isotopes. These evolutions are very\nsimilar with those found in the Y isotopes (see Fig. 9) and\ntherefore, they additionally support the assignment of 9\/2+\nto the 1195.4 keV state. This assignment is discussed further\nin the section presenting the main results of the shell-model\ncalculations.\nB.

Because it is a rather strongly populated cascade, it\nwas assigned to the positive-parity sequence starting from the\nEx = 758.7 keV isomeric level, with J\u03c0 = 9\/2+ (the spin\nassignment of this level in Ref. [14] is erroneous, as correctly\npointed out also in Ref. [22]). The tentative J\u03c0 assignments in\nFig. 8 are based on the multipolarities given in Table I.

The excitation energy \u201cx\u201d of the lowest level is not\nknown. A possible spin-parity assignment for the lowest level is J \u03c0 =\n6+ and the observed cascade may continue with some positive-parity\nstates (see text).\n[23]. The residual interaction named \u201cgwbxg\u201d in the code\nand the corresponding \u201cgwb\u201d model space were used to\ncalculate the excitation energies of the states of interest and\nthe electromagnetic transition probabilities between them. The\n\u201cgwb\u201d model space includes four valence proton orbitals\n(1f5\/2, 2p3\/2, 2p1\/2, and 1g9\/2) and six valence neutron or-\nbitals (1g9\/2, 2p1\/2, 2d5\/2, 1g7\/2, 3s1\/2, and 2d3\/2). The resid-\nual interaction set contains a combination of calculated and\nempirical two-body matrix elements described in the code\n(details concerning this interaction are given in Ref. [20]). The\nelectromagnetic decay transition probabilities were calculated\nusing as the effective gyromagnetic factors the classical values\nof free nucleons and as the effective charges the values of 1.5\nand 0.5 for the proton and neutron, respectively.\nDue to the large dimensions of the valence space, in the\ncalculations for all three nuclei only up to three particles\n(protons and\/or neutrons) were allowed to be excited from\nthe low-energy orbitals, f5\/2, p3\/2, d5\/2, into the higher-energy\nones, g9\/2, p1\/2, g7\/2, d3\/2, s1\/2. Also, the 1g9\/2 and 2p1\/2\nneutron orbitals were constrained to be fully occupied. The\ns1\/2 and d3\/2 single-particle energies for the neutrons were\nslightly modified, as described in detail in Ref. [20].\nWe discuss first the two odd-mass nuclei, 89Rb and 93Y,\nand then the odd-odd nucleus 92Y.

In\nthe calculated level scheme, the \u03b3 -ray transitions are labeled\nby their relative calculated branching ratios. The orbital\noccupancies provided by the shell-model calculations are\ngiven in Table II. The low-lying negative parity states are well\nreproduced. The comparison with the calculation suggests that\nthe two (7\/2) states at 586 and 998 keV may have negative\nparity. The lowest negative-parity states, 5\/2\u2212, 9\/2\u2212, 13\/2\u2212,\nhave a dominant simple structure resulting from the coupling\nof a f5\/2 proton to a pair of d5\/2 neutrons coupled to spins 0,\n2, and 4. The calculations predict that up to the spin 13\/2\nthe yrast states are of negative parity, whereas above this\nvalue the positive-parity states become yrast. As discussed\nin the previous section, there are arguments in favor of\nthe positive-parity assignment for the observed states above\n1 MeV. Both the energy of the positive-parity states relative\nto the negative-parity ones and the positive-parity yrast states\nabove the 9\/2+ isomer are reasonably well predicted by the\ncalculations. Because the 19\/2+ and 21\/2+ states lie close to\neach other and the 19\/2+ state decays predominantly to the\n17\/2+ state, one cannot unambiguously assign the spin of the\nhighest state observed at 4033 keV.\n9\/2 758.7\n(13\/2 ) 1550.4\n(15\/2 ) 2622.8\n(19\/2 ) 3345.4\n(21\/2 ) 3636.8\n4314.0\n1\/2 0.0\n3\/2 590.2\n791.7\n722.6\n1072.4\n291.4\n677.2\n93Y\n0.82 s\nFIG. 8. Level scheme of 93Y as determined from the present work.\nB. 93Y\nThe comparison of the experimental level scheme and the\nshell model predictions for 93Y is shown in Fig. 11. Unlike\nthe case of 89Rb, the observed sequence is not a stretched\nE2 cascade. The calculations show indeed that the yrast\nline follows the sequence 9\/2+, 13\/2+, 15\/2+, then possibly\n19\/2+, which decays predominantly toward the 15\/2+ state.\nThe calculated dipole transition from 19\/2+ to 17\/2+ is very\nmuch retarded mainly because the 17\/2+ and 19\/2+ lie very\nclose in energy. According to the multipolarities in Table I,\nthe experimental sequence may continue with the 21\/2+ and\n25\/2+ states, like the theoretical one. At higher spins the\nagreement deteriorates probably due to the severity of the\nvalence space truncation used in our calculations.\nC. 92Y\nFigure 12 presents the comparison of the calculations with\nthe level scheme observed for 92Y. In the same figure, one\ncan see a similar comparison for its isotone 94Nb [24], for\nwhich shell-model calculations were performed using the same\ntruncation conditions, the same valence space, and the same\nresidual interaction set.\nIn 94Nb, the experimental yrast sequence was observed\nas an irregular cascade on top of a low-energy transition of\n79 keV, (7+) \u2192 6+, and some other yrare transitions feeding\nthe same state [24]. We note here that we made a new study\nof 94Nb based on the triple coincidence data obtained in the\n82Se+192Os experiment and, while largely confirming the level\nscheme assigned in Ref. [24], this new study showed that some\nchanges are necessary.

BUCURESCU et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 76, 064301 (2007)\nin the cascade, as determined by the multipolarities given\nin Table II, show clear similarities to the 94Nb case where\nthe 10+ state decays to the 9+ state and then to the 7+\none with connecting transitions of about 1000\u20131200 keV. In\ngood accordance with the experimental data, the shell-model\ncalculations predict similar decay patterns for these states\nin both nuclei. Higher up, it is difficult to extend both the\nsimilarity with 94Nb and the comparison with the calculated\nspectrum. Both the truncation used and the lack of the high-j\norbital (1h11\/2) make the calculations in the gwb space less\nrealistic at relatively large excitation energies. For example,\nbecause h11\/2 has a high spin value, by coupling an unpaired\nh11\/2 neutron with an unpaired g9\/2 proton and eventually with\nthe spin of one pair of neutrons in d5\/2 with spins 0, 2, or 4h\u00af,\nnegative-parity states with total spins in the range of 10\u201314h\u00af\nmay be generated rather close to, or even along the yrast line.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nPositive-parity yrast decay sequences were identified\nin 89Rb, 92Y, and 93Y by combining the results of two\nmultinucleon transfer reaction experiments with those ob-\ntained from a fusion-evaporation reaction. In the multinucleon\ntransfer reaction experiments, several previously unknown\n\u03b3 -ray transitions were detected in coincidence with the\nrecoiling nuclei 89Rb, 92Y, and 93Y. Starting from these newly\nidentified transitions, the level schemes of these nuclei were\nconstructed by analyzing the triple \u03b3 -ray coincidence data\nacquired in a thick target experiment. The observed structures\ncontribute to the experimetal data systematics of the nuclei\nwith N = 52, 53, and 54.\nShell-model calculations were performed for all nu-\nclei with the OXBASH shell-model code using the\ngwb configuration space (\u03c0f5\/2, \u03c0p3\/2, \u03c0p1\/2, \u03c0g9\/2, \u03bdp1\/2,\n\u03bdg9\/2, \u03bdd5\/2, \u03bdg7\/2, \u03bds1\/2, and \u03bdd3\/2) and the gwbxg residual\ninteraction. The neutron 2p1\/2 and 1g9\/2 orbitals were kept\nfully occupied and only up to three nucleons were allowed to be\nexcited from the low-energy orbitals, f5\/2, p3\/2, and d5\/2, into\nthe higher-energy ones, g9\/2, p1\/2, g7\/2, d3\/2, and s1\/2. With\nthese truncations, the calculations describe reasonably well\nthe observed level schemes up to medium-high spin values of\n10\u201311h\u00af.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe acknowledge support received within the FP6 European\nContract EURONS n RII3-CT-2004-506065-V Framework\nProgramme.
