The buckling mechanism was identified as the laser forming mechanism responsible for the induced bending. For both lasers it was found that the induced bending angles increased with an increasing number of irradiations and high laser powers, whilst decreasing as the traverse speed was increased. Also, it was apparent from the experimental results that the laser bending angle was only linearly proportional to the number of irradiations when the latter was small due to local material thickening along the bend edge with a high number of irradiations. Owing to the mild steel\u2019s greater beam absorption at the HPDL wavelength, larger bending angles were induced when using the HPDL. However, under certain conditions the performance of the CO2 laser in terms of induced bending angle was seen to approach that of the HPDL. Nevertheless, similar results between the two lasers were only achieved with increasing irradiations, thus it was concluded that the efficacy of the HPDL was higher than that of the CO2 laser insofar as it was more efficient. From graphical results and the employment of an analytical procedure, the laser line energy range in which accurate control of the HPDL bending of the mild steel sheets could be exercised efficiently was found to be 53 J mm-1 < P\/v < 78 J mm-1, whilst for the CO2 laser the range was 61 J mm-1 < P\/v < 85 J mm-1","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/53045.pdf","fullTextIdentifier":"http:\/\/eprints.lincoln.ac.uk\/3252\/1\/Paper_37.pdf","pdfHashValue":"0239f9184ccba559cb587e803d332e085ca0ccc4","publisher":"Professional Engineering Publishing","rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n    \n    \n      oai:eprints.lincoln.ac.uk:3252<\/identifier><datestamp>\n      2013-03-13T08:45:18Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n      7374617475733D707562<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      7375626A656374733D6A6163735F48:6A6163735F48363830<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      7375626A656374733D6A6163735F48:6A6163735F48373030<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n      74797065733D61727469636C65<\/setSpec><\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:relation>\n    \n      \n        http:\/\/eprints.lincoln.ac.uk\/3252\/<\/dc:relation><dc:title>\n        A comparative investigation of the efficacy of CO2 and high power diode lasers for the forming of EN3 mild steel sheets<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\n        Lawrence, Jonathan<\/dc:creator><dc:subject>\n        H680 Optoelectronic Engineering<\/dc:subject><dc:subject>\n        H700 Production and Manufacturing Engineering<\/dc:subject><dc:description>\n        A comparative investigation of the effectiveness of a high power diode laser (HPDL) and a CO2 laser for the forming of thin section EN3 mild steel sheet has been conducted.

Also, it\nwas apparent from the experimental results that the laser bending angle was only linearly\nproportional to the number of irradiations when the latter was small due to local material\nthickening along the bend edge with a high number of irradiations. Owing to the mild steel\u2019s greater\nbeam absorption at the HPDL wavelength, larger bending angles were induced when using the\nHPDL. However, under certain conditions the performance of the CO2 laser in terms of induced\nbending angle was seen to approach that of the HPDL. Nevertheless, similar results between the\ntwo lasers were only achieved with increasing irradiations; thus it was concluded that the e\u00a4cacy of\nthe HPDL was higher than that of the CO2 laser insofar as it was more e\u00a4cient.

This is certainly true in\nthe case of laser forming, which is increasingly being\nrecognized as a viable alternative to traditional methods\nin certain applications. What is more, many possibilities\nexist for the deployment of laser forming within produc-\ntion engineering for alignment and adjustment pro-\ncedures [1], while complex geometric forms, which\nordinarily can only be produced with great di\u00a4culty\nusing conventional forming techniques, can be made\nvery easily with laser forming [2]. Despite the fact that\nthe origins of the laser forming technique can be traced\nback to the established method of \u00afame bending [3, 4],\nlaser forming is a much more re\u00aened and controllable\ntechnique that oVers numerous unique application\npossibilities. This extensive variety of possible applica-\ntions within industry exists due to a number of factors,\nnamely the reasonably high degree of control over the\nenergy transfer, the high levels of accuracy and reprodu-\ncibility, the very high degrees of \u00afexibility and the non-\ncontact nature of the technique. Such attributes are the\ndirect result of the nature of the operating characteristics\nof lasers. Consequently, the very fact that the technique\nis laser-based means that it could be employed to form\nparts in locations where it would otherwise be impossible\nto use conventional forming methods, such as in outer\nspace [5].\nLaser forming is basically a spring-back-free , non-\ncontact process in which bending is induced by a local-\nized laser-generated temperature gradient between the\nirradiated surface and the neighbouring material. This\ntemperature distribution forces the material to expand\nnon-uniformly, which in turn leads to non-uniform\n1481\nB12501 IMechE 2002 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture\nThe MS was received on 27 November 2001 and was accepted after\nrevision for publication on 29 July 2002.\nthermal stresses. Where the thermal stresses exceed the\nyield point of the material, plastic deformation is occa-\nsioned. As a consequence, the material initially curves\ninwards towards the laser beam and then outwards\naway from it, the latter occurrence being driven by the\ncompressive nature of the thermal stresses induced by\nthe more rigid interior material layers, which are much\ncooler.\nEarly work by Namba [5, 6] reported on the potential\nhigh degrees of \u00afexibility of the laser-forming process.\nSince then many researchers have studied various aspects\nof the technique in great detail. In particular, Vollersten\n[7, 8], Vollersten and Ro\u00c8 dle [9], Vollersten and Holzer\n[10] and Geiger and Vollersten [11] have investigated\nthoroughly the mechanisms active in laser forming. In\nmore recent times the technique has been advanced\nthrough the development of a number of numerical\n[12\u00b115], analytical [16] and \u00aenite element method\n(FEM) [17\u00b121] mathematical models for various aspects\nof the laser forming process. Additionally, Hennige et al.\n[22], Hennige [23] and Magee et al. [24] have conducted\nstudies to improve the dimensional accuracy of parts\nproduced using laser forming, while similarly, both\nSprenger et al. [25] and Li and Yao [26] studied the eVects\nof stress and strain on the quality of laser bends. Both\nArnet and Vollersten [27] and Vollersten et al. [28]\nhave successfully demonstrated the technique\u2019s ability\nto form complex shapes.\nIn all the above studies, however, the sheet metal\nforming was conducted using the well-established CO2\nor Nd :YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium\ngarnet) lasers. To date, only Lopez et al. [29] and\nLawrence et al. [30] have investigated the possibility of\nforming metal sheets with the HPDL. This present\nwork examines the eVectiveness of the HPDL to carry\nout the laser forming of common engineering mild steel\n(EN3) in comparison with a CO2 laser. It is believed\nthat a number of process advantages can be realized\nthrough the employment of the HPDL as opposed to\nthe CO2 or Nd:YAG laser. These include the on-site\ndeployment potential as a result of the HPDL\u2019s inherent\nportability and robustness and the better material\ncoupling e\u00a4ciency (beam absorption) of the HPDL. To\ndate, much work has been carried out to study the eVects\nof laser wavelength variation for medical and surgical\napplications, revealing clear diVerences in the perfor-\nmance and eVectiveness of many diVerent lasers for\nsuch applications. In contrast, comparisons of the diVer-\nences in the beam interaction characteristics with various\nmaterials of the predominant materials processing lasers,\nthe CO2, the Nd:YAG and the excimer lasers, are\nlimited, with only the main fundamental diVerences\nresulting from wavelength variations being presented\n[31\u00b134]. In comprehensive investigations, Lawrence\nand Li compared the eVects of CO2, Nd:YAG, excimer\nand HPDL radiation on the wettability characteristics\nof an Al2O3\/SiO2 based ceramic [35], a mild steel\n[36, 37] and selected biomedical polymer (PMMA) [38],\nnoting that changes in the wettability characteristics of\nthe ceramic and the steel varied depending upon the\nlaser type. In addition, Lawrence and Li carried out a\ncomparative study of the characteristic of the glazes gen-\nerated on the surface of concrete with the CO2 laser and\nthe HPDL [39, 40], as well as determining the absorption\ndepths of CO2 and HPDL beams in ordinary Portland\ncement [41, 42] and an Al2O3-based refractory [43].\n2 BASIC PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE LASER\nFORMING PROCESS\nThe process of laser forming is eVected by introducing\nthermal stresses into the surface of a workpiece. These\ninternal stresses induce plastic strains which result in\nthe local elastic buckling of the workpiece. Essentially\nthere are three laser forming mechanisms [10, 11]: the\ntemperature gradient mechanism, the buckling mechan-\nism and the upsetting mechanism. The conditions for the\ntemperature gradient mechanism are energy parameters\nthat led to a steep temperature gradient across the\nsheet metal thickness. The beam diameter is typically in\nthe order of the sheet metal thickness, while the traverse\nrate has to be large enough for a steep temperature\ngradient to be maintained. The path of the laser beam\non the surface of the metal is usually a straight line\nacross the whole width, with this straight line being the\nbending edge. Initially the surface of the metal is\nheated, which in turn leads to pure elastic strains.\nBecause of the thermal expansion of the surface layer\nof the metal there is a counter-bending of the workpiece\naway from the laser beam. The amount of counter-\nbending is very small as only the heated area on the sur-\nface, which is approximately the size of the beam spot,\nhas to generate forces that produce the counter-bending\nof the whole sheet. Further heating leads to a decrease of\nthe \u00afow stress in the heated area and a further increase of\nthe thermal expansion of the surface layer. At a certain\ntemperature, which is dependent upon the material, the\ngeometry and the degree of counter-bending, the thermal\nstrains reach the maximum elastic strain that the metal\ncan endure at the given temperature. A further increase\nin the temperature results in a conversion of the thermal\nexpansion into plastic compressive strains. These plastic\ncompressive strains accumulate until the laser beam\nmoves on, allowing cooling to begin. Cooling is mainly\ndue to self-quenching, with the heat \u00afowing into the sur-\nrounding bulk material, resulting in cooling of the heated\narea within 10\u00b120 s. During cooling shrinkage of the\nheated material occurs. This causes a counter-bending\naction on account of the fact that the surface layer was\nplastically compressed during heating and is therefore\nshorter after cooling than the non-heated layers. Because\nof the diVerent lengths of the surface layer and the lower\nlayers of the material, a bending angle develops towards\n1482 J LAWRENCE\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture B12501 IMechE 2002\nthe laser beam. Typically angles of between 0.1 and 3\nare achieved after one laser pass.\nThe buckling mechanism will occur if the laser beam\ndiameter is large compared to the sheet metal thickness\nand the processing time is slow, resulting in a small tem-\nperature gradient across the sheet metal thickness.\nPrimarily the material is heated, which in turn leads to\nthe thermal expansion of the material and results in com-\npressive stresses in the heated region. If the heated area is\nlarge enough and if there is a small natural deviation\nfrom the perfect plane, which normally exists in real\nmetal sheets, an instability, or buckle, develops. In the\ncentre of the buckle the temperature is extremely high;\ntherefore the \u00afow stress in this region is relatively low\nand the bending of the sheet in this region is conse-\nquently nearly totally plastic. In contrast, the root of\nthe buckle, which is far away from the centre of the\nlaser beam, is heated to a much lesser extent. Thus the\ntemperature is low and the \u00afow stress in this region is\nrelatively high, resulting in completely elastic bending\nof the sheet in this region. By controlling certain param-\neters, positive (concave bending towards the laser beam)\nor negative (convex bending away from the laser beam)\nbending can be achieved with the buckling mechanism\n[27, 28]. As the beam is traversed along the surface the\nbuckle shifts along the bending edge. The direction of\nthe buckling is predetermined by the existing buckle,\nand as such the remaining part of the sheet buckles in\nthe same direction. The traversing of the beam across\nthe surface also causes the stiVness of the workpiece to\nalter. At the start of the buckling process the bending\nlegs are held in the original plane due to the stiV sur-\nrounding material. As an increasing amount of the\nsheet is formed by the buckle, the forces that held the\nbending legs straight decrease. Therefore the elastic\npart of the buckle relaxes and only the plastic part\nremains in the sheet, resulting in an angular bend.\nBecause the buckling mechanism results in more energy\nbeing coupled into the workpiece, bending angles are\noften up to 15 after one pass of the beam.\nThe upsetting mechanism will occur if the laser beam\ndiameter is in the order of, or less than, the sheet metal\nthickness and the traverse speed is slow compared to\nthe thermal conductivity of the material. Also, the geo-\nmetry of the workpiece must be such that buckling of\nthe material is prevented. The slow processing speed\nwill result in almost homogeneous heating across the\nthickness of the sheet metal. Owing to the temperature\nincrease, the \u00afow stress decreases in the heated area\nand the thermal strains approach the elastic strains at\nthe yield stress. Additional heating leads to a plastic\ncompression of the heated material as it is hindered in\nfree expansion by the surrounding bulk material.\nHence a large amount of the thermal expansion is con-\nverted into plastic compression. During cooling the\nmaterial contracts and the plastic compressive strain\nremains in the sheet for exactly the same reason as in\nthe temperature gradient mechanism. On account of\nthe constancy of volume there is an increase in the\nsheet thickness in the compressed area.\n3 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nThe steel used in the laser forming experiments was the\nubiquitous EN3 low carbon mild steel. The mild steel\nwas received in the form of rectangular billets\n(100 \u00a3 50 \u00a3 0:4mm3). Apart from the necessary cleaning\nof the billet surfaces with methanol to remove any\nunwanted grease, the billets were used as-received in\nthe experiments.\nThe lasers used to conduct the forming experiments\nwere a CO2 laser (Ro\u00aen-Sinar) emitting a circular\nbeam at 10.6 m with a maximum output power of\n1 kW and an HPDL (Ro\u00aen-Sinar) emitting a rectangular\nbeam at 940 nm with a maximum output power of\n1.2 kW. The CO2 laser beam was delivered to the work\nsurface by focusing the beam through a 150mm focal\nlength KCl lens to give a stable converging beam. The\nHPDL beam was focused directly on to the workpiece.\nBoth lasers produced a multimode beam. In order to\nobtain a reasonably direct comparison of the eVective-\nness of both lasers for the forming of the EN3 mild\nsteel sheets, the laser power densities used were set to\napproximately the same value by manipulating the spot\nsizes of the beams such that the incident areas were the\nsame. Thus for the CO2 laser the beam spot size was\n4.5mm in diameter, while the spot size of the HPDL\nbeam was 4 \u00a3 4mm2. The sizes of the beams were\nmeasured using the standard burn paper procedure.\nThe general laser processing experimental arrangement\nis shown schematically in Fig. 1. Essentially the\ndefocused laser beams were \u00aered back and forth along\nthe same path on the surface of the mild steel sheet by\ntraversing the samples beneath the laser beams using\nthe x and y axes of a computer numerical control\n(CNC) gantry table. The beams of both lasers impinged\non the surface of the mild steel samples perpendicularly.\nNo surface melting of the mild steel was observed on\nany of the samples during or on completion of the laser\nforming. In all the experiments, the holding time between\neach irradiation was \u00aexed at 0 s. The bending angles\nobtained as a result of forming with both lasers were\ndigitally captured using a charge-coupled device (CCD)\ncamera and measured to an accuracy of \u00a70.1 using\nimage processing software (Visilog 5).\n4 RESULTS\nThe mechanism responsible for the forming of the EN3\nmild steel sheets when using both the CO2 laser and the\nHPDL can be attributed entirely to the buckling\nmechanism. This assertion can be made because,\nA COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFICACY OF CO2 AND HIGH-POWER DIODE LASERS 1483\nB12501 IMechE 2002 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture\naccording to the work of Arnet and Vollersten [27] and\nVollersten et al. [28], if the size of the laser beam\nemployed is large compared to the sheet metal thickness\nthen forming of the metal sheet is eVected by the buck-\nling mechanism. This is certainly the case in this present\nstudy where the beam size for both lasers was only\n16mm\n2\nwhile the EN3 mild steel sheets had a thickness\nof 0.4 mm.\nThe relationship between the laser bending angle and\nthe number of irradiations in a multiple-irradiation\nprocess is best represented by an \u00ac\u00b1n curve, where \u00ac is\nthe bending angle and n is the number of irradiations\n[44]. The \u00ac\u00b1n curves for the EN3 mild steel sheets\nobtained at diVerent laser powers but with a \u00aexed\ntraverse speed of 600mm\/min are given in Fig. 2. It is\nevident from Fig. 2 that the bending angles obtained\nFig. 1 Schematic illustration of the experimental set-up for the CO2 laser and the HPDL forming of EN3mild\nsteel sheets\nFig. 2 The \u00ac\u00b1n curves obtained for the CO2 laser and the HPDL at diVerent laser powers (600mm\/min\ntraverse speed)\n1484 J LAWRENCE\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture B12501 IMechE 2002\nwhen employing the HPDL were consistently greater\nthan those obtained with the CO2 laser. It is also appar-\nent from Fig. 2 that for both lasers, the bending angle\ninduced in the EN3 mild steel sheets increased almost\nlinearly with the increasing number of irradiations,\nwith the degree of linearity being greatest for the\nHPDL. At the same time, the gradients of the curves\ncan be seen to increase with increasing laser incident\npower. The eVect of laser power on the \u00aenal bending\nangle (after 40 irradiations) at diVerent traverse speeds\nwas investigated and the results are shown in Fig. 3. It\ncan be seen from Fig. 3 that a laser power threshold\nexists for both lasers, below which no bending will\noccur. Furthermore, it is clearly apparent from Fig. 3\nthat for both the CO2 laser and the HPDL, a certain\ncritical value of laser power exists, beyond which further\nincreases in power, regardless of the magnitude, bring\nabout only marginal increases in the bending angle.\nSimilarly, the eVects of varying the traverse speed\nwhile keeping the laser power at a \u00aexed value of 1 kW\non the \u00ac\u00b1n curves for the EN3 mild steel sheets are\nshown in Fig. 4. Again, the bending angles occasioned\nFig. 3 EVect of laser power on the \u00aenal bending angle for the CO2 laser and the HPDL (after 40 irradiations)\nFig. 4 The \u00ac\u00b1n curves obtained for the CO2 laser and the HPDL at diVerent traverse speeds (1 kW laser\npower)\nA COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFICACY OF CO2 AND HIGH-POWER DIODE LASERS 1485\nB12501 IMechE 2002 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture\nafter HPDL irradiation are consistently greater than\nthose of the CO2 laser. Also, as before, the bending\nangle was seen to increase almost linearly with the\nnumber of irradiations for both lasers, with the results\nof the HPDL exhibiting a greater degree of linearity\nthan those of the CO2 laser. Even so, the gradients of\nthe curves for both lasers decreased as the traverse\nspeed was increased. The in\u00afuence of traverse speed on\nthe \u00aenal bending angle (after 40 irradiations) is shown\nin Fig. 5 and reveals that for both lasers the induced\nbending decreased in gradual increments as the traverse\nspeed increased. In addition, Fig. 5 shows that at the\nlower traverse speeds (less than 540mm\/min) the\ncurves for the CO2 laser and the HPDL were more com-\nparable than at higher traverse speeds, especially at the\nhighest laser powers. Still further, as the traverse speed\nincreases then the accord between the curves of the two\nlasers diminishes.\n5 DISCUSSION\nThe observance of a linear relationship between the laser\nbending angle and the number of irradiations seen on the\n\u00ac\u00b1n curves, particularly for the HPDL, in Figs 2 and 4 is\nin general agreement with the \u00aendings of a number of\nworkers [6, 44, 45]. However, such \u00aendings are at odds\nwith those of other researchers [24, 25] who have\nreported a decaying increase in the bending angle with\nan increasing number of irradiations. This signi\u00aecant\ndiVerence between the \u00aendings of this study and those\nof the latter workers is believed to be due to diVerent\ndegrees of local thickening and strain hardening of the\nEN3 mild steel sheet during HPDL bending. From\ncomprehensive studies conducted by Vollersten [7] and\nSprenger et al. [25], the laser bending angle was said\nnot to increase linearly with the number of irradiations\ndue to: (a) changes in the absorption behaviour of the\nsteel with increasing irradiations, (b) the increase in\nthe sheet thickness along the bending edge and (c) the\nstrain hardening eVect on the underside of the sheet.\nBy virtue of its beam wavelength, the HPDL enjoys\nrelatively high levels of beam absorption with many\nmetallic materials, as con\u00aermed by Fig. 6. For mild\nsteel the absorption of HPDL radiation is around 45\nper cent compared with only 15 per cent for the CO2\nlaser [29]. With such a considerable diVerence in beam\nabsorption between the CO2 laser and the HPDL, it is\nreasonable to cite beam absorption, and ultimately\nlaser wavelength, as one of the major in\u00afuences on the\ndiVerences in the performance of the CO2 laser and the\nHPDL for the laser forming process. This postulation\nis borne out somewhat when consideration is given to\nthe convergence to varying degrees in forming perfor-\nmance of the CO2 laser and HPDL observed when the\nlaser power was increased (Figs 2 and 3) and when the\ntraverse speed was decreased (Figs 4 and 5). Both of\nthese actions, increasing the laser power incident on a\nsurface and reducing the traverse speed of an incident\nlaser beam across a surface, are tantamount to much\nthe same thing, namely increasing the energy deposited\non the surface itself. The outcome of this increase in\nthe amount of energy deposited on a surface, in this\ncase the surface being that of the EN3 mild steel sheets,\nis that the temperature of the surface, particularly in\nthe region of laser interaction, will increase. This induced\nincrease in temperature, in turn, aVects the absorption\ncharacteristics of the metal. According to von Allmen\nFig. 5 EVect of traverse speed on the \u00aenal bending angle CO2 laser and the HPDL (after 40 irradiations)\n1486 J LAWRENCE\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture B12501 IMechE 2002\nand Blatter [44], the bulk absorption of metals increases\nwith temperature due to the apparent electron\u00b1lattice\ncollision time shortening. In addition, hot metals are\nreactive and irreversible changes in re\u00afectance resulting\nfrom chemical reactions at the surface (e.g. oxidation)\ntend to take place. This being the case, then, as the\nenergy deposited on the surface of the EN3 mild steel\nsheets increased as a result of either an increase in the\nlaser power or a decrease in the traverse speed, the sub-\nsequent increase in the surface temperature will lead to\nan increase in the beam absorption and thus an increase\nin the induced bending angle. However, the results in\nFigs 2, 3, 4 and 5 show the performance of the CO2\nlaser in terms of induced bending angle to be approach-\ning that of the HPDL under these conditions, implying\nthat an increase in laser beam absorption is only occa-\nsioned for the CO2 laser. Indeed, this may be so, as mini-\nmized changes in absorptivity have been observed\npreviously by Scully [45] for the Nd :YAG laser. Since\nthe wavelength of the HPDL is very similar to that of\nthe Nd:YAG laser, 940 and 1064 nm respectively, then\nit is reasonable to assume that such minimized changes\nin the absorptivity will occur likewise with the HPDL.\nAs such, it appears that under the conditions of either\nincreased laser power or decreased traverse speed, the\neVectiveness of the CO2 laser for forming is similar to\nthat of the HPDL in that similar bending angles are\ninduced in the EN3 mild steel sheets. However, as can\nbe seen from Figs 2 and 4, convergence in performance\nis dependent on temperature eVected reductions in re\u00afec-\ntance and similar results between the two lasers are only\nachieved with increasing irradiations. It is therefore\nreasonable to assert that, overall, the bending eVective-\nness of the HPDL is greater than that of the CO2 laser\ninsofar as it is more e\u00a4cient, since the diVerence in the\nbeam absorption of the two lasers is so much greater\nthan the diVerence in the actual forming performance.\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that a factor that is\nlikely to have been in\u00afuential is that of beam geometry.\nNaturally, diVerences in the beam absorption and the\nheat diVusion within the EN3 mild steel sheets will\nhave occurred on account of the fact that a circular\nbeam was produced by the CO2 laser while the HPDL\nbeam was rectangular in shape.\nIt is known that strain hardening only comes into play\nduring laser bending for relatively thick sheets of typically\nmore than 1mm in thickness [24].Moreover, if the sheet is\nrelatively thin, as was the case in this study, the in\u00afuence\nof strain hardening and material thickening along the\nbend edge can be considered to be almost insigni\u00aecant\nwhen the number of irradiations is small [47]. Hence a\nlinear relationship between the bending angle and the\nnumber of irradiations will exist. Nevertheless, strain\nhardening and material thickening along the bend edge\nis unavoidable if the number of irradiations increases.\nThis is principally because local thickening will occur\nunder the temperature gradient mechanism, causing the\nsheet to increase its thickness locally in the irradiated\n(and thus heated) zone. In addition, the bending angle\nenlarges when the number of irradiations increases; there-\nfore more work has to be done on the underside of the\nsheet, which subsequently leads to strain hardening on\nthe underside of the sheet. It is thought, therefore, that\nthe bending angle will no longer be linearly proportional\nto the number of irradiations as the eVects of strain\nhardening and material thickening along the bend edge\nbecome more pronounced. This supposition is con\u00aermed\nsomewhat by Fig. 7. Here the number of irradiations was\nincreased considerably from the experimental normal of\n40\u00b180 irradiations for both lasers. It is possible to discern\nfromFig. 7 that for both theCO2 laser and the HPDL, the\nincrease in the bending angle is no longer linearly propor-\ntional to the number of irradiations when the latter\nexceeds around 60 irradiations. It is therefore possible\nto conclude that for the CO2 laser and HPDL bending\nof the EN3 mild steel sheets used in this present study,\nFig. 6 Re\u00afectance versus wavelength of various polished metal surfaces [46]\nA COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFICACY OF CO2 AND HIGH-POWER DIODE LASERS 1487\nB12501 IMechE 2002 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture\nthe bending angle is only linearly proportional to the\nnumber of irradiations when the latter is small, less\nthan approximately 60 irradiations but greater than 10\nirradiations.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 3, a laser power threshold for\nboth lasers exists below which no bending could be occa-\nsioned. Such a \u00aending concurs with that of Holt [4], who\nnoted that a critical temperature was required for\nthermal upsetting or a permanent change in shape to\ntake place. It is also apparent from Fig. 3 that as the\nlaser power was increased beyond a certain value,\nwhich diVered depending upon the laser and traverse\nspeed used, the induced increases in the bending angle\nwere only marginal. This is believed to be due to the\nfact that at high laser power, the resultant heat generated\nwill penetrate fully to the underside of the sheet. To\ndetermine the signi\u00aecance of these observed thresholds\nfurther, it was necessary to examine the relationship\nbetween the laser bending angle and the laser line\nenergy (with the laser line energy being de\u00aened by the\nratio of the laser power and the traverse speed). This\nrelationship is shown in Fig. 8, from which it is apparent\nFig. 7 The \u00ac\u00b1n curve obtained for a large number of irradiations for the CO2 laser and the HPDL\nFig. 8 Relationship between the bending angle and the laser line energy for the CO2 laser and the HPDL\n1488 J LAWRENCE\nProc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture B12501 IMechE 2002\nthat a threshold energy input of around 53 and 61 J\/mm\nexists for the HPDL and the CO2 laser respectively. Also,\nan almost linear region can be seen below 78 and 85 J\/\nmm for the HPDL and the CO2 lasers respectively.\nThese limits to the linearity of the process represent the\nmaximum laser line thresholds; i.e. they are the values\nof laser line energy at which the bend angle is linearly\nrelated to the laser line energy and are therefore the\npoints beyond which further increases in the laser line\nenergy result in less overall controllability of the bend\nangle, and in turn the process as a whole. More speci\u00ae-\ncally, the threshold values indicate the range in which\nthe bending process can be operated most eVectively\nand e\u00a4ciently. The fact that a smaller amount of laser\nline energy is required to initiate bending with the\nHPDL is further con\u00aermation that the HPDL is more\ne\u00a4cient for the laser bending process than the CO2 laser.\nSuch linearity, coupled with the existence of a mini-\nmum laser line energy threshold, indicates that the\ninduced bending angle could be accurately controlled\nfor both lasers by adjusting the laser operating param-\neters. Furthermore, the presence of this linearity and\nthe minimum laser line energy threshold conforms with\nthe analytical model developed by Yau et al. [48].\nAccording to this model, the laser bending angle can be\nexpressed by\n\u00ac \u02c6 3\u00ad AP\n\u00bbCpvh\n2\n\u00b3\n7\n2\n\u00b4\n\u00a1 36 l\nh\nY\nE\n\u20261\u2020\nwith the critical condition for bending to occur being\ngiven by\nAP\nvl\n12\u20261 \u2021m2\u2020\n7\u20261 \u2021m\u2020\nY\u00bbCp\nE\u00ad\nh \u20262\u2020\nwhere \u00ac is the \u00aenal laser bending angle, \u00ad is the coe\u00a4-\ncient of thermal expansion, A is the absorptivity, \u00bb is\nthe density, Cp is the heat capacity, Y is the yield\nstrength, E is Young\u2019s modulus, h is the thickness, m is\nthe thickness ratio, P is the laser power, v is the traverse\nspeed and l is the beam radius. However, since only one\ntype of material is under investigation, equation (2) can\nbe simpli\u00aeed to\nP\nv\nC\n0 \u20263\u2020\nwhere C\n0\nis a constant relating to both the material and\nthe geometry characteristics of the EN3 mild steel\nsheets. Thus, from equation (3) it can be deduced that\nto exercise accurate control of the HPDL bending of\nthe EN3 mild steel sheets investigated, it is necessary\nthat the process should be operated in the range of\n53 J\/mm < P=v < 78 J\/mm. Likewise for the CO2 laser,\naccurate control of the process can be obtained from\noperating within 61 J\/mm < P=v < 85 J\/mm. The fact\nthat a smaller amount of laser line energy is required to\ninitiate bending with the HPDL is further con\u00aermation\nthat the HPDL is more e\u00a4cient for the laser bending\nprocess than the CO2 laser.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nA comparative investigation of the forming of EN3 mild\nsteel sheet (100 \u00a3 50 \u00a3 0:4mm3) to various degrees using\na contemporary 1.2 kW high-power diode laser (HPDL)\nand a 1kW CO2 laser has been conducted. Because the\nsize of the beams of both lasers employed in this study\nwere large (16mm\n2\n) compared to the sheet metal thick-\nness (0.4mm), the buckling mechanism was identi\u00aeed\nas the laser forming mechanism responsible for the\ninduced bending. For both lasers it was found that the\ninduced bending angles increased with an increasing\nnumber of irradiations and high laser powers, while\ndecreasing as the traverse speed was increased. Also, it\nwas apparent from the experimental results that the\nlaser bending angle was only linearly proportional to\nthe number of irradiations when the latter was small,\nless than approximately 60 irradiations and greater\nthan 10 irradiations. It is believed that the absence of\nlinearity observed when more than around 60 irradia-\ntions were used is due to local material thickening\nalong the bend edge. Owing to its greater beam absorp-\ntion by the EN3 mild steel (45 per cent for the HPDL\ncompared with only 15 per cent for the CO2 laser),\nlarger bending angles were induced when using the\nHPDL. However, increases in the energy deposited on\nthe surface of the EN3 mild steel sheets, as a result of\neither an increase in the laser power or a decrease in\nthe traverse speed, subsequently increased the surface\ntemperature and led to an increase in the beam absorp-\ntion and thus an increase in the induced bending angle.\nHowever, due to only minimized changes in the absorp-\ntivity of the EN3 mild steel at the HPDL wavelength, the\nperformance of the CO2 laser in terms of induced bend-\ning angle was seen to approach that of the HPDL under\nthese conditions. Nevertheless, similar results between\nthe two lasers were only achieved with increasing irradia-\ntions and it is therefore reasonable to assert that, on the\nwhole, the performance of the HPDL is more eVective\nthan that of the CO2 laser insofar as it is more e\u00a4cient.\nFrom graphical results and the employment of an analy-\ntical procedure, the laser line energy range in which\naccurate control of the HPDL bending of the EN3\nmild steel sheets could be exercised was found to be\n53 J\/mm < P=v < 78 J\/mm, while for the CO2 laser the\nrange was 61 J\/mm < P=v < 85 J\/mm.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author wishes to express his gratitude to the\nWarwick Manufacturing Group at The University of\nA COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFICACY OF CO2 AND HIGH-POWER DIODE LASERS 1489\nB12501 IMechE 2002 Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 216 Part B: J Engineering Manufacture\nWarwick, England, and Gintic, Singapore, for kindly\nallowing him to use their lasers and sharing their\nexpertise with him.\nREFERENCES\n1 Hennige, T., Holzer, S., Vollersten, F. and Geiger, M.
