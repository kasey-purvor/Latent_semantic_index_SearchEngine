Introduction. The response of a superconducting material to an externally\nimposed magnetic field is most conveniently described by Fig. 1, which shows the\nminimum energy state of the superconductor as a function of H0, the applied magnetic\nfield, and the material parameter (known as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter),\nwhich determines the type of superconducting material; n < 1\/x\/ describes what is\nknown as a type I superconductor, and n > 1\/xfl describes what is known as a type II\nsuperconductor.\nFor type I superconductors there is a critical magnetic field Hc below which the\nmaterial will be in the superconducting state but above which it will revert to the\nnormally conducting (normal) state. The transition between normal and supercon-\nducting states as the applied magnetic field is raised or lowered through Hc takes\nplace by means of phase boundaries separating normal regions from superconducting\nregions sweeping through the material and is described in [10], [13], and [22].\nFor type II superconductors a third state exists, which is known as the mixed state.\nThe mixed state, as its name suggests, is neither wholly superconducting nor wholly\nnormal but consists of many normal filaments embedded in a superconducting matrix.\nEach of these filaments carries with it a quantised amount of magnetic flux and is\ncircled by a vortex of superconducting current; thus these filaments are often known\nas vortices. The transition from the normal state to the mixed state takes place via\na bifurcation as the magnetic field is lowered through some critical value He2 (known\nas the upper critical field), and is described in [1], [5], [11], [12], [23], [25], and [26].\nThis bifurcation is subcritical for type I superconductors but supercritical for type II\nsuperconductors; hence, although the mixed state exists in type I superconductors, it\nis unstable and therefore observed only in type II superconductors.\nThe transition between wholly superconducting and mixed states is studied in [9].\nThe critical field Hc plotted in Fig. 1 (known as the lower critical field) is calculated\non the basis of an energy argument; it is the field at which the energy of the wholly\nsuperconducting solution becomes equal to the energy of the single vortex solution for\nan infinite superconductor. It is found in [9] that there is a barrier to the generation\nof vortices and that there exists a \"superheating field,\" Hsh, such that for fields\nHo < Hsh vortices will not be generated even though the wholly superconducting\nsolution may not be the minimum energy solution.\nReceived by the editors February 25, 1994; accepted for publication (in revised form) September\n6, 1994.

The response of a superconducting material as a function of the applied magnetic field\nHo and the Ginzburg-Landau parameter .\nIn this paper we will consider the behaviour of the superconductor while it is in\nthe mixed state for large values of the parameter and for fields H0 << He2.\nWe will draw heavily on analogies between superconducting vortices and vortices\nin an inviscid fluid. In an otherwise irrotational, inviscid fluid a (curvilinear) line\nvortex F is a solution of the equations\n(1) curl u w0r(x),\n(2) div u 0,\nwhere u is the fluid velocity, w0 is the circulation of the vortex (Wo 2rK, where K\nis the vortex strength), x (x, y, z), and\n5r(x) 9f 5(x x\u2019)5(y y\u2019)5(z z\u2019) dx\u2019,\nwhere 5 is the Dirac &function. Introducing a vector potential Y2 such that\n(3) curlY2 u,\n(4) div Y2 0,\nwe find\n(5) (curl) 2 Y2 -V2 Y2 w06r(x).\nUsing the Green\u2019s function for the Laplacian on 73 we find that Y2 is given by\nWo . _1 dx(6) F2 s\nwhere s m and s =1 s l. Hence\nwo jfr l dx wo fr ( ) wo \/i s A dx\u2019(7) u(x) curl V A dx\u2019 4 s------\"\nThis is the familiar Biot-Savart law.\nA MEAN-FIELD MODEL OF SUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES 1261\nThe asymptotic behaviour of (7) as the point x approaches the vortex line is given\nby [28]\n020 020\n-\nlog Cb +\nwhere r and 0 are local polar coordinates centred on the vortex line, e0 is the unit\nvector in the local azimuthal direction, C is the curvature of the vortex line, and b is\nthe unit vector in the binormal direction (see, e.g., [24]).\nThe law of motion for vortices in an inviscid fluid simply states that they are\nconvected with the fluid velocity. The first term in (8) corresponds to the rotation\nof the fluid about the vortex line and does not result in any translation. The second\nterm determines the motion of the vortex line and, since it must be evaluated on\nr 0, implies that the vortex moves with infinite velocity in the binormal direction.\nIn actual fact equations (1)-(2) cease to be valid as the vortex core is approached.\nThey are derived as the first term in an expansion of the Navier-Stokes equations as\nthe Reynolds number tends to infinity. Near the vortex core the velocity gradients of\nthis outer solution become unbounded, and an inner region needs to be introduced,\nin which viscous forces are not negligible. When the solution in the inner region is\nmatched with the limit of the outer region as the core is approached, the leading-order\nvelocity of the vortex line is found to be\n(9) ov\n--4-logeCb+O(1),\nwhere e is the radius of the viscous core region [7].\nLet us now turn to superconducting vortices. It has been shown in [14] that as\noc a superconducting line vortex is a solution of the equations\n(10) (curl)2H + H 2zr6r(x),\n(11) div H 0,\nwhere H is the magnetic field and 6r is as before. Equation (10) is known as the\nLondon equation. In deriving it in [14] it was assumed that the timescale for the\nrelaxation of the magnetic field was much shorter than the timescale for the motion\nof vortices, so that the magnetic field is quasi-static. A calculation of these timescales\nfor various materials in [27] indicates that this assumption is valid.\nNote the absence of the parameter w0 in the equations above. This is because,\nunlike fluid vortices, vortices in a superconductor have quantised strengths. Further-\nmore, it is found numerically [16], [17] and experimentally [4], [18] that the only stable\nvortex is that containing exactly one quantum of magnetic flux, and hence all super-\nconducting vortices have the same strength, which we have nondimensionalised to\nunity.\nUsing the Green\u2019s function for the modified Helmholtz equation on a (10) can\nbe inverted to give\n1J e-s dx(12) H(x)\n-\ns\nAn alternative regularization involves replacing the vortex by a thin region of distributed vor-\nticity, as in [21], which also results in (9).\n1262 $. JONATHAN CHAPMAN\nwhere s is as before. The magnetic field H is analogous to the fluid vector potential\nY. The variable analogous to the fluid velocity u is the current j, which is given by\nlfr (_) l jrr (1 1)(13) j(x) curl H\n-\nV A dx\u2019\n2\ne\n-5 +\n-\ns A dx\u2019.\nFollowing the argument that led to (8), it is shown in [14] that the asymptotic be-\nhaviour of (13) as the point m approaches the vortex core is also given by\n1 1\n-co- logrCb+O(1),(14) J\nr\nwhere r, e0, C, and b are as before.\nThe first major difference between fluid vortices and superconducting vortices is\nin the law of motion. Rather than moving with the current j, a superconducting\nvortex moves in a direction perpendicular to the current, with a velocity given by\n(15) v=jAt,\nwhere t is the unit tangent to the vortex line. This relationship is often interpreted\nas follows. The right-hand side can be interpreted as the \"Lorentz force\" on a vortex\nline due to the presence of the current, since the vortex carries with it a unit amount\nof magnetic field. Equation (15) follows from equating this driving force to a ficticious\n\"viscous drag\" experienced by the vortex as it moves, which is taken to be proportional\nto its velocity. (Time has been scaled so that the drag coefficient is unity.)\nThe asymptotic behaviour (14) would seem to imply that the vortex moves with\nan infinite velocity in the normal direction. In actual fact, as in the case of a fluid,\nequations (10)-(11) are simply the outer expansions of a more complicated model as\nthe parameter tends to infinity. In this case the underlying model is the Ginzburg-\nLandau theory. When an inner region is introduced near the vortex core and matched\nwith the limit of the outer region, as in I14], it is found that the leading-order velocity\nof the vortex is given by\n1(16) v log e Cn,2\nwhere e is again the radius of the vortex core (which is the inverse of the Ginzburg-\nLandau parameter ). It is this asymptotic matching which justifies the relationship\n().\nThe purpose of this paper is to formulate a mean-field model, in which the individ-\nual vortices are homogenized to give a vortex density, or vorticity. We use the case of\nvortices in an inviscid fluid as a paradigm problem, since there we are already familiar\nwith the mean-field model we hope to obtain--it is simply the Euler equations.\nBefore we proceed we make a final comment on the laws of motion of vortices.\nWhen more than one vortex is present, we may decompose the velocity of a particular\nvortex into two components. The first is the self-induced velocity, which we denote\nby vs, and the second is the velocity due to all the other vortices present, which we\ndenote by vg. Using the above arguments, we find that for a fluid\na0 log e Cb + 0(1)(17) v8 4r\n(lS) v u,\nA MEAN-FIELD MODEL OF SUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES 1263\nas e\n-\n0, where u.o is the velocity of the fluid due to all the other vortices (i.e.,\nhaving removed the singular contribution from the vortex itself). Similarly, for a\nsuperconductor\n1(19) vs 2 logeCn + O(1),\n(0) v j\/ e,\nwhere j. is the current due to all the other vortices.\nNow, ug and j. will be of order 1\/52 when the vortices are separated by\ndistances of order 5. For well-separated vortices, that is, for 5 1, ug andj will\nbe O(1) and the leading term in the vortex velocity will be the self-induced motion.\nHere, however, we consider the limit in which the distance between vortices tends\nto zero, so than 5 << 1\/ Ilog 11\/2, u9 and j. are very much greater than vs,\nand the self-induced motion is replaced by a motion due to the mean field. For the\ncase of superconducting vortices this argument has been justified in [14], through an\nasymptotic analysis of densely packed vortices.\n2. Paradigm problem: Homogenization of vortices in an inviscid fluid.\nAs a paradigm problem for the homogenization of vortices in a superconductor, we\nconsider the problem of homogenization of line vortices in an inviscid fluid. The model\nwe hope to derive is simply the Euler equations.\nWe consider the motion of a system of vortices of equal strength. The fluid\nvelocity, u, satisfies\n(21) curl u cz0 6r. (x),\n(22) div u 0,\nwhere the curves Fi are the positions of the vortices and w0 is the vortex strength.\nWe formally define\n(23) 3w0\n-X\u2019J<rl\nWe consider the limit as r]\n--\n0, c0 --+ 0, and the number of vortices tends to infinity\n(i.e., the separation 5\n--\n0) in such a way that 5 << , and oa lira,__.0 co is finite. For\nthis to be so we must have cv0 of order 52, so that ca0\/52 is finite. That such a limit\nexists is the key assumption, and we do not attempt to justify it here. In particular,\nit is not clear that a distribution of vortices will remain separated by distances of\norder 5, even if they are so initially. We note that the procedure of averaging discrete\nline vortices to produce a continuum model is very similar to the vortex method for\ncalculating inviscid, rotational flows, in which continuously distributed vorticity is\napproximated by point vortices. For two-dimensional flows, in which the vorticity\nis always directed normal to the plane of interest, the two procedures are effectively\ninverses, since three-dimensional line vortices reduce to two-dimensional point vor-\ntices. In this case, justifying the limiting procedure above is equivalent to proving the\nconvergence of the vortex method, which has been done in [19]. In three dimensions,\nhowever, the two procedures differ, since the vortex method uses point vortices, while\nwe are interested here in averaging line vortices. Thus, although the convergence of\nthe point vortex method has been established in [20], the rigorous justification of the\nlimiting procedure above remains open.\n1264 S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN\nWe define the average velocity g as\n(24) g lim 3 fx udV,d-,0 47d3\n(where the limiting process is such that r\/<< d). It is not difficult to show formally\nthat as r\/, 5, d, cOo\n-\n0, g satisfies\n(25) curl\n(26) div O.\nTo close the model we need to derive an evolution equation for w, which will take the\nform of a conservation equation.\nSuppose the vortices are convected with a velocity field v. Consider an arbitrary\nsurface S (not closed), and form a tube T around the vortices which pass through\nS as shown in Fig. 2. Let S and T be convected with the velocity field v. Then no\nvortices will then enter or leave the tube T, since the vortices are convected with the\nsame velocity v. Thus the number of vortices crossing S is conserved. This can be\nwritten as\nas o,\nsince this integral simply counts the number of vortices crossing the surface S. Now\nas we pass to the limit e 0, it can be shown formally that this integral becomes\n(28) d-- o. n dS O.\nFIG. 2. A tube T enclosing the vortices passing through the surface S.\nA MEAN-FIELD MODEL OF SUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES 1265\nThis is our conservation law in integral form. Since the surface S is arbitrary, we have\nthe equivalent differential form\n(29) cot + curl (w A v) O.\nIt remains to relate the velocity field of the vortices to the velocity field of the fluid.\nFollowing the discussion at the end of the introduction, self-induced motion is negli-\ngible in comparison to the mean-field motion. Hence the vortices will move with the\nmean fluid motion, i.e., v g.\nThus we arrive at the Euler equations\n(30)\n(31)\n(ae)\nwt+curl(wAv) O,\ncurl oa,\nV\u2019v 0.\n3. A mean-field model of superconducting vortices. We now derive an\nanalagous model for vortices in superconductors. As before we formally define\n(33)\n-x\u2019l<v 2@ E 6(x\u2019 xi) dx\u2019,\nand consider the limit in which --, 0 and the number of vortices tends to infinity\n(i.e., the separation 5 --, 0) in such a way that 5 << r\/and the vorticity\n(34) w lim\nis O(1\/(52). Note that since superconducting vortices all have unit strength we cannot\nlet the strength of the vortices tend to zero as 5 0. The consequence of this is that\nthe magnetic field generated by the vortices is not O(1) but order 1\/52 However, if\nwe rescale the magnetic field with 1\/52 the effect is the same as letting the strength\nof the vortices tend to zero, and it is easy to show formally that as , 5, d\n--\n0 in\n(10), (11) the rescaled average magnetic field H satisfies\n(35) H-V2 oa,\n(36) V. H 0.\nAs before, we need to write an equation for the evolution of oa in the form of a\nconservation law. Given a velocity field v with which the vortices are convected,\nexactly the same argument holds as in the previous example, and thus we have\n,, dS 0\nfor an arbitrary surface S convected with the velocity field v. As before there is the\nequivalent differential form\n(38) oat -+- curl (oa A v) 0.\nIt remains to relate the velocity field v to the magnetic field H and the vorticity\noa. Following the discussion in the introduction, the self-induced motion is again\nnegligible in comparison to the mean-field motion, so that v is given by\n(39) v j A & curl H A &,\nwhere j is the average current and & is a unit vector in the direction of\n1266 S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN\nThus we arrive finally at the following mean-field model for the motion of vortices\nin a superconductor (where we drop the overline and use H to denote the average\nmagnetic field):\n(40) cot +curl (coAv) 0,\n(41) (curl)2H \/ H co,\nv.u 0,\n(43) v curlHAd.\nRemark. Note that equations (41) and (42)imply that\n(44) V. co 0\nas expected, since vortices cannot start or end except at boundaries. Note also that\nequation (40) implies 0(V .co)lOt 0, so that if V .co is zero initially it will remain so.\nEquation (41) then implies that V. H 0, so that equation (42) is in fact superfluous\nin this case.\nRemark. The model (40)-(43) for superconducting vortices is ostensibly very\nsimilar .to the model (30)-(32) for fluid vortices. Indeed, a close inspection reveals\nonly two differences. If the term H were removed from equation (41) and the term\nd were removed from equation (43), so that these equations read\n(curl)2H co,\nv curl H,\nrespectively, then H would simply be the vector potential of an inviscid fluid (which\nreduces to the stream function in two-dimensional flows), and we clearly have co curl\nv as in equation (31). However, together the two terms omitted change the nature of\nthe equations quite considerably.\nEquation (43) describes the nature of the interaction between superconducting\nvortices. In particular the presence of the term da means that there is a repul-\nsive\/attractive interaction between like\/unlike vortices along the line of centers,\nin contrast to the interaction perpendicular to the line of centres between fluid vor-\ntices. This leads to a diffusive type of behaviour and an apparent lack of turbulence\namong superconducting vortices. For example, a common observation is the forma-\ntion of a stable two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of superconducting vortices. The\ncorresponding lattice of fluid vortices would be unstable (although von Karmon vor-\ntex streets may persist for some time, despite their instability). This difference in the\ninteraction leads us to conjecture that the rigorous justification of the limiting pro-\ncess for superconducting vortices will be easier than the corresponding justification\nfor fluid vortices, since the mean-field model we obtain is \"better behaved.\"\nThe term H in equation (41) appears at first sight merely to change the decay\nof the magnetic field H away from regions of vorticity to being exponential rather\nthan algebraic. In fact it has a much greater significance, since it implies that there\nis a natural lengthscale associated with the model, in contrast to the Euler equations,\nwhere lengths can be scaled arbitrarily. We will investigate this aspect of the equations\nfurther in 6.\nRemark. It will be useful to calculate the average electric field associated with\nthe model (40)-(43) since this will allow the calculation of effective resistivities due\nto vortex motion.\nA MEAN-FIELD MODEL OF SUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES 1267\nIn [14] it is shown that the electric field associated with a single moving vortex is\ngiven by\n0 (curlH)+rAv\nAveraging over many vortices we find\n0 (curlH)\/wAv,(46) E\nwhere E and H now represent the average electric and magnetic fields, respectively.\nThe first term here simply corresponds to the London equation\nE Ot\nwhile the second term is the electric field generated by the vortex motion.\nWe note that (46) is consistent with Maxwell\u2019s equations, since\ncurlE+ 0t 0t (curl) +H +curl(coAv)\nOt + curl (co A v),\n0\nby (40) and (41).\nRemark. The model (40)-(43) is only appropriate for a clean homogeneous\nsuperconductor, i.e., one with no sites at which vortices are \"pinned.\" In practice,\nhowever, it is exactly the pinning of vortices which is the most technologically im-\nportant aspect of superconductivity. In 7 we will generalise the model to include\nsuch effects. We note here though that even with the introduction of pinning sites,\nequation (40) will remain valid as before, since pinning will not affect the conserva-\ntion of vortices. Similarly equation (41) simply describes the magnetic field generated\nby vortices, which will not be affected by the pinning of vortices. Equation (42) is\nsimply a Maxwell equation. Thus all the extra physics required to model pinning\nand\/or fluctuations must be built into equation (43), which can be seen as a kind of\n\"material law.\"\nFinally we note that, as expected, equations (40)-(43) reduce to the two-\ndimensional equations derived in [15] in the case where H (0, O, H(z, y, t)), co\n(0,\n+ v. 0,\n(48) -VH+ H w,\n(49) v -sign(a)VH.\n4. Boundary conditions. The boundary conditions on the magnetic field H\nwill be the usual boundary conditions at an interface between two media, namely,\n(50) [(1\/,)HAn] 0,\n(al) 0,\nwhere [] denotes the jump in the enclosed quantity across 0 and p is the permeability.\nFor most practical applications the permeability of the external region will be close to\n1268 S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN\nthat of the superconducting region, so that these relations simply give the continuity of\nH across the boundary Oft. These conditions couple equations (40)-(43) to Maxwell\u2019s\nequations in the region external to the superconductor (which we denote by fte)\"\n(s2)\n(s3)\n(s4)\n(ss)\ncurl H j,\ncurl E +\nOH\nOt\ndiv H\ndiv E\n0,\n0,\n\/9,\nwhere E is the electric field and p is the charge density. As mentioned earlier, in\nwriting equation (10) we were assuming that the magnetic field relaxes instantly on\nthe timescale for the motion of vortices. In this approximation the normal current\nflowing in the superconducting material has been neglected in comparison with the\nsuperconducting current, except in vortex cores. To be consistent a similar approxi-\nmation should be adopted in fte, giving j 0 there. For most practical applications\nit will indeed be the case that the current in the external region is negligible in com-\nparison to the current in the superconductor. For the few situations in which it may\nnot be the case the general question of how a normally conducting current becomes a\nsuperconducting current as it passes through a metal\/superconducting interface needs\nto be addressed, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.\nWe now have enough conditions to determine H if co is given. The need for addi-\ntional boundary conditions on co depends on whether the characteristics of equation\n(40) are directed into or out of ft on the boundary. If v. n > 0, where n is the unit\noutward normal to Oft, the vortices are leaving the sample and no extra information\nneed be given. However, if v. n < 0, vortices are moving into the sample and we need\nto give extra information in order to determine the flux of vorticity across Oft.\nIt is not immediately obvious what this extra boundary condition should be, and\nthis may become the subject of future discussion. We present here one possibility.\nIt is found experimentally [3], [4] and has been examined theoretically in [9] that\nno vortices will be generated at the boundary until the current density there reaches\na critical value Jnuct, which we call the nucleation current density and which is a\nmaterial parameter which will depend among other things upon surface roughness.\nThus if curl HI< Jnuc we should have co 0, indicating that no vortices are coming\nin through the boundary.\nWhen the current density is high enough to generate vortices at the boundary,\nwe postulate that the rate of production of vorticity, i.e., the flux of the vorticity\nthrough the boundary, will be proportional to the excess of the current density over\nthe nucleation current density. In two dimensions this leads to the condition\n(56) v na a ([7H -Jt)+ if v n < 0,\nwhere (.)+ =max(., 0). In generalising this equation to three dimensions we need to\ngive also the direction of the flux as well as the magnitude. There are two obvious\npossibilities: perpendicular to j and parallel to H, giving\n(57) n A (co A v) a (IJ] -Ju)+ n A j if v.n < 0\nand\n(58) n A (co A v) ct (IJl + n A (n A H)InAH if v.n\n<_ O,\nA MEAN-FIELD MODEL OF SUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES 1269\nrespectively. The analysis in [9] indicates that vortices are generated when the electric\ncurrent density, rather than the magnetic field, becomes too large; thus we would\nconjecture that the former of these conditions is the more realistic.\nIn the limit as c\n-\noc the production of vortices when the current density exceeds\nJnct is so rapid that the current density will be immediately reduced to Jnc, and\nthe boundary condition becomes\neither n. (-wVH) > 0\n(59) or n. (-wVH) < 0 and [VH -J 0\nor n. (-wVH) 0 and VHI -J < 0\nin two dimensions and\neither n. (curl HAw) > 0\n(60) or n-(curlHAw) < 0 and curlH I-J=0\nor n. (curl H A co) 0 and curl HI -J < 0\nin three dimensions. However, in taking this limit in three dimensions, we have lost\na boundary condition, since (60) is only a scalar equation, while (57) and (58) are\nvector equations.\nWe stress that we are only speculating about what may form sensible boundary\nconditions on (40)-(43). It remains an interesting open problem to determine what\ntype of boundary condition on w gives a mathematically well-posed problem. Of\ncourse, since our equations are ultimately derived from the Ginzburg-Landau equa-\ntions, to obtain the boundary conditions on w we should really perform an analysis\nof the rate at which vortices enter a sample using the Ginzburg-Landau model, ex-\ntending the work in [9].\n5. Discontinuous vortex densities. Since equation (40) gives the system\n(40)-(43) a real characteristic, we have the possibility of solutions with discontin-\nuous w. Indeed, in two dimensions there is a whole family of static solutions in which\nw is discontinuous with compact support [15].\nWe now derive the conditions on an interface at which there is a discontinuity in\nco. Integrating equation (40) over a small box containing part of the interface gives\n(61) vn v.n,\nwhere v is the normal velocity of the interface. This was to be expected, since if the\ndiscontinuity is to propagate it must move at the same speed as the vortices on either\nside. Applying the same procedure to the equations\nleads to the conclusion that\nj curl H,\ncurl j + H w\n(62) [H An] 0,\n(63) [curl HAn] 0,\nwhere [] denotes the jump in the enclosed quantity across the interface. The same\nargument applied to div j div H -0 gives\n(64) [H.n] 0,\n(65) [curl H. n] 0,\n1270 S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN\nwhile (44) implies\n(66) [w. n] 0,\nHence H and curl H are continuous across the interface. Note that the jump in co\nitself is not determined. Note also that the boundary conditions (61)-(66) are not all\nindependent.\nIn two dimensions, with H (O, O,H(x, y, t)), w (O, O, w(x, y, t)), equations\n(61)-(63) become\n(67) [H] 0,\n(68) 0,\nOH(69) vn -sign(w) On on F,\nwhere v is the normal velocity of the interface F. One case of particular interest is\nthat in which the vorticity is zero on one side of the interface, representing vortices\nmoving into a previously superconducting region. Equations (47)-(49) and (67)-(69)\nthen give\n(70) at\n(71) -V2H + H\n(72) -V2H+H\n(73) [H]\nV.(IwlVH)\nw in\n0 in\n0,\n(75) vn -sign(w) OHOn on F,\nwhere ft, is the mixed or vortex region and fts is the superconducting region. A\ntravelling wave solution to these equations, representing a wave of vortices moving\ninto a previously superconducting region, has been studied in [8] and was shown to\nbe linearly stable.\n6. Nonlinear diffusion as a limiting case. Throughout the analysis so far we\nhave been working on the natural lengthscale for the decay of the magnetic field away\nfrom a superconducting vortex, which is known as the penetration depth and denoted\nby AL. We mentioned at the end of 3 that lengths cannot be scaled arbitrarily in\nequations (40)-(43). If we scale length instead with a typical length of our supercon-\nducting sample, say, (and rescale time with 12\/2L accordingly), then we arrive at\nthe following equations:\n(76) wt +curl (wAy) 0,\n(77) H-\n(78) V-H 0,\n(79) v curl\nwhere =\/L\/1. Typically \/L is of the order of tenths of microns, whereas may be\nof the order of millimeters. Thus will be of the order of 10-3-10-4. If we make the\nA MEAN-FIELD MODEL OF SUPERCONDUCTING VORTICES 1271\nassumption that\/-\/does not vary too quickly on this lengthscale, so that X72\/-\/is not\ntoo large, then we may let A 0 to obtain the following simplified model:\n(so) u,\n(81) Ht+curl (HA(curlHAlf-\/)) 0,\n(82) V. H 0,\nwhere if-\/is the unit vector in the direction of H. Equation (81) has been previously\nwritten by Brandt [6].\nOf course, in order to impose boundary conditions on (81) we need to consider\nboundary layers. When an interface F between a region in which H 0 and a region\nin which H 0 is examined using inner and outer asymptotic expansions it is found\nthat the free boundary conditions on (81) are\n(83) H 0 on F,\n(84) v n. (curl HA f-\/) on F.\nEquation (81) is a nonlinear diffusion equation and demonstrates the diffusive\nnature of (40)--(43). The diffusive nature of the equation becomes more obvious if we\nconsider the simpler two-dimensional case in which H (0, O,H(x, y, t)). Then (81)\nbecomes\n(s5) He V (I H VH)\nwhich we recognise as a version of the porous medium equation.\nconditions (83), (84)become\nThe boundary\n(86) H 0 on F,\n(87) v -sign(H)OHOn on F.\nThere is an extensive literature on equation (85); see [2] for a review.\n7. Pinning and fluctuation effects. As we remarked at the end of 3, the\nmodel (40)-(43) is appropriate only for a superconductor which has no sites at which\nvortices are \"pinned.\" Since most superconducting samples are full of pinning sites\n(grain boundaries, twin planes, dislocations, impurities, cracks), and since the pinning\nof vortices is crucial in applications, we generalise the model here to include such\neffects.\nSince equations (40)-(42) hold regardless of pinning or fluctuation effects, all the\nextra physics needed to model pinning and\/or fluctuation effects must be built into\nequation (43).\nVarious scales of pinning sites can be introduced. One possible scenario is that\nof many small pinning sites outnumbering the vortices. In this case it is conjectured\nthat a vortex will not move until the current at that point exceeds a certain critical\nvalue, the depinning current Jpin, required to break it away from its pinning site.\nOnce moving the direction of the velocity of the vortex will follow the Lorentz force\nas before, but the presence of a sea of pinning sites will also slow the vortex to beneath\nits ideal speed. Once the depinning current has been exceeded, the velocity may again\nbe linear in the current density (as in Fig. 3), or it may be that the curve asymptotes\n1272 S.

The possible form of the velocity of a vortex v as a function of the local current density j.\nto the ideal curve (as in Fig. 4), as the pinning sites have a lesser effect on fast-moving\nvortices. A careful analysis of the interaction between vortices and pinning sites will\nbe needed to determine this curve theoretically. Of course, it may be determined\nempirically from experimental measurements of resistivity as a function of current\ndensity.\nWhen such a relationship between the vortex velocity and the current is adopted,\nthere will clearly be two regions: one in which j I< Jpin and the vortices are stationary\nand one in which J I> Jpn and the vortices are moving. The result is the following\nfree-boundary problem:\n(88) (curl)2\/-\/+ H w in \u20191,\n(89) cot 0 in \u20191,\n(90) curl HI < Jpin in al,\n(91) (curl)2H +\/-\/\n(92) cot +curl(coAv) 0 in\n(93) ]curl H\ns\ns\ns\ns\ns\ns\ns\nFIG. 4.

In particular, unlike the interface conditions of 5, the\nvelocity of the boundary is no longer equal to the local vortex velocity.\nIf the density of pinning sites is nonuniform throughout the sample, then the\ndepinning current Jpin will be a function of position. It will also be a function of\ntemperature, and thermal effects could be built into the model this way. In particular\nthermal fluctuations can be modelled by incorporating fluctuations of Jpi. it may\nalso be that Jpi is a function of the magnetic field H. Further investigation of the\nnature of pinning is needed to clarify this possibility.\nLarge-scale pinning sites may be incorporated into the model if we introduce a\npinning potential into equation (43), i.e., add an attractive velocity toward certain\npinning sites. Some vortices would then be pinned at these sites, and depending on\nthe number of such sites, other vortices may flow around them. Clearly, a combination\nof both sizes of pinning sites can also be modelled.\n8. Conclusion and further remarks. We have derived a mean-field model for\nthe motion of vortices in the mixed state of a type II superconductor. The model\nconsists of a quasi-static equation for the magnetic field coupled with an evolution\nequation for the vortex density, in a particular limiting case the model reduces to\na degenerate, nonlinear diffusion equation, which we considered in 6. In 7 we\ngeneralised the model to include vortex pinning and fluctuation effects.\nFinally, we comment on two further restrictions to the applicability of the model.\nTemperature range. Equations (40)-(43) have effectively been derived from\nthe London equation (10) and the Lorentz force law (15). Both of these can be\nderived as the London limit of the Ginzburg-Landau equations, and therefore the\nmodel (40)-(43) should be valid, for London superconductors whenever the Ginzburg-\nLandau equations are valid.\nHall effect. In the law of motion (15) the velocity of a vortex has been taken\nto be in a direction perpendicular to the current. In fact there is also a component\nof the velocity in the direction parallel to the current, due to the Hall effect (by\nwhich a moving charged particle is deflected by a magnetic field). This component\nis generally small in comparison to the Lorentz component (about 10%) but could\neasily be included in the law of motion if we simply add another term to (15).\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. A.
