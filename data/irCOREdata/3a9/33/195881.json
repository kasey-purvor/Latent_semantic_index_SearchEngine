However, the\nexpression of GM-CSF and its receptor in airway samples\nin asthma and COPD across disease severity needs to be\nfurther defined.\nMethods: Sputum GM-CSF was measured in 18 control\nsubjects, 45 subjects with asthma and 47 subjects with\nCOPD. Enumeration of GM-CSF+ cells in the bronchial\nsubmucosa and airway smooth muscle bundle was\nperformed in 29 control subjects, 36 subjects with\nasthma and 10 subjects with COPD.\nResults: The proportion of subjects with measurable GM-\nCSF in the sputum was raised in those with moderate (7\/\n14) and severe (11\/18) asthma, and in those with COPD\nGOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung\nDisease) stage II (7\/16), III (8\/17) and IV (7\/14) compared\nwith controls (1\/18) and those with mild asthma (0\/13);\np = 0.001. The sputum GM-CSF concentration was\ncorrelated with the sputum eosinophilia in subjects with\nmoderate to severe asthma (rs = 0.41; p = 0.018). The\nmedian (interquartile range) GM-CSF+ and GM-CSFR+\ncells\/mm2 of submucosa was increased in severe asthma\n(1.4 (3.0) and 2.1 (8.4)) compared with those with mild to\nmoderate asthma (0 (2.5) and 1.1 (5)) and healthy\ncontrols (0 (0.5) and 0 (1.6)), (p = 0.004 and p = 0.02,\nrespectively).\nConclusions: The findings support a potential role for\nGM-CSF in asthma and COPD and suggest that over-\nexpression of GM-CSF in sputum and the bronchial\nmucosa is a particular feature of severe asthma.\nThe airway diseases asthma and chronic obstruc-\ntive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common and\ncause significant morbidity and mortality world-\nwide. Asthma affects 10% of children and 5% of\nadults, and its prevalence continues to rise.1 Severe\nasthma accounts for about 10% of asthma, but is\nparticularly important as it leads to debilitating\nchronic symptoms despite optimal standard\nasthma treatment and contributes to over half of\nthe healthcare costs attributed to asthma.1\u20133 COPD\nis a major public health problem and will rank as\nthe third cause of death in 2030.4 Both conditions\nare characterised by airflow obstruction with\nairway inflammation, and remodelling. Although\nthe inflammatory profiles of asthma and COPD\nhave been described as overlapping,5 asthma is\nmore commonly associated with Th2-mediated\neosinophilic inflammation6 whereas in COPD\nneutrophilic inflammation is more predominant.5\nSeveral cytokines and chemokines have been\nimplicated in driving the airway inflammatory\nresponse in asthma and COPD.\nGranulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating\nfactor (GM-CSF) is a major regulator of inflam-\nmatory cells of the myeloid lineage and has been\nimplicated in asthma and COPD.7 It is released by a\nrange of structural and inflammatory cells, includ-\ning airway epithelium, airway smooth muscle\n(ASM), fibroblasts, T lymphocytes, mast cells,\neosinophils and macrophages. GM-CSF has\nrecently been shown to signal via a ternary\nreceptor complex (GM-CSFR) composed of a\n2:2:2 hexamer consisting of two bc chains, two\nGMRa chains and two GM-CSF molecules.8 GM-\nCSF is a pleiotrophic and proinflammatory cyto-\nkine that stimulates myelopoiesis, promotes leu-\ncocyte survival and activation, and regulates\nmucosal immunity and inflammation in part via\nmodulation of Toll-like receptor-49 and neutrophil\nfunction.10 Its importance in airways disease is\nsupported by evidence from mouse models of\nCOPD7 and asthma,11 whereby administration of\nanti-GM-CSF antibody attenuates the neutrophilic\nand eosinophilic inflammatory response, respec-\ntively. Importantly, in human disease, GM-CSF\nexpression is increased in sputum, bronchoalveolar\nlavage (BAL) and bronchial biopsies in asthma.12\u201317\nIn contrast, in COPD there is a lack of direct\nevidence of increased GM-CSF expression in air-\nway secretions or biopsy tissue. However, in\nculture, GM-CSF secretion by ex vivo sputum cells\nis increased in COPD.18 Similarly, whether GM-\nCSFR expression is increased in airways disease is\ncontentious, with one study suggesting that GM-\nCSFR is increased in non-atopic, but not atopic\nasthma.19 Therefore, GM-CSF and GM-CSFR\nexpression in airways disease needs to be further\ndefined.\nWe hypothesised that GM-CSF and GM-CSFR\nexpression is increased in asthma and COPD, and is\nrelated to disease severity. To test our hypothesis\nwe have measured the sputum GM-CSF concen-\ntration and enumerated in bronchial mucosa the\nnumber of GM-CSF+ and GM-CSFR+ cells in\nasthma and COPD.\nMETHODS\nSubjects\nSubjects were recruited from hospital staff, the\ngeneral respiratory and the \u2018Difficult Asthma\u2019\nclinics at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, local\nAirway biology\nThorax 2009;64:671\u2013676. doi:10.1136\/thx.2008.108290 671\nprimary healthcare and by local advertising. Asthma was\ndefined according to the current Global Initiative for Asthma\n(GINA) guidelines.20 Subjects with asthma had typical symp-\ntoms and the presence of one or more of the following objective\ncriteria: significant bronchodilator reversibility of forced epira-\ntory volume in 1 s (FEV1) .200 ml, a provocation concentra-\ntion of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) of\n,8 mg\/ml or a peak flow amplitude percentage mean over\n2 weeks of .20%. Asthma severity was classified using the\nGINA treatment steps.20 COPD was diagnosed and severity\ncategorised by using the Global Initiative for Chronic\nObstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria.21 Subjects with\nCOPD who demonstrated partial bronchodilator reversibility\nwere not excluded. Subjects were recruited as three independent\ncross-sectional groups, to assess sputum GM-CSF concentration\nin asthma and COPD (group 1); and GM-CSF and GM-CSFR\nexpression in proximal airways in asthma (group 2) and COPD\n(group 3). Subjects were free from exacerbations for at least\n6 weeks. Healthy controls had normal spirometry, and some\nsmokers with .10 pack-year history were included to enable\ncomparisons between healthy smokers and COPD subjects. All\nsubjects gave written informed consent, with study approval\nfrom the Leicestershire ethics committee.\nProtocol\nFor all subjects, demographics and spirometry were recorded.\nSubjects with asthma and healthy controls in groups 1 and 2\nalso underwent a methacholine inhalation test using the tidal\nbreathing method22 and allergen skin prick tests for\nDermatophagoides pteronyssinus, dog, cat and grass pollen.\nSputum induction using incremental concentrations of neb-\nulised hypertonic saline 3, 4 and 5% each for 5 min was also\nperformed in all subjects in groups 1 and 2.23\nIn group 2, subjects underwent bronchoscopy conducted\naccording to the British Thoracic Society guidelines,24 and\nbiopsies were taken from the right middle and lower lobe\ncarinae. In group 3, proximal airway samples were collected\nfrom surgical specimens. All bronchial mucosal specimens were\nfixed in acetone and embedded in glycomethacrylate as\ndescribed previously.25\nSputum GM-CSF measurement\nSputum was selected, dispersed using the mucolytic dithio-\nthreitol (DTT) and processed to generate a sputum differential\ncell count, and cell-free supernatants were stored at 280uC for\nlater analysis as described previously.26\nSputum GM-CSF was measured by ELISA (Caltag-\nMedsystems, Buckinghamshire, UK). The lower limit of\ndetection was 10 pg\/g sputum. The GM-CSF assay was\nvalidated in line with European Respiratory Society recommen-\ndations to assess the effect of DTT and the recovery of\nexogenous spiking with recombinant cytokine.27 GM-CSF\nrecovery was not affected by DTT, and recovery of exogenous\nspiked GM-CSF was 103% (15%) (n = 4).\nGM-CSF and GM-CSFR expression in endobronchial biopsies\nSections of 2 mm were cut and stained using monoclonal\nantibodies against GM-CSF (clone: BVD2-21C11, Cambridge\nBioScience, Cambridge, UK), GM-CSFR (clone: 2B7, a mono-\nclonal antibody raised to the extracellular domain of GM-CSFR,\ngift from Dr Sleeman. MedImmune, Grant Park, Cambridge,\nUK), or appropriate isotype controls (rat immunoglobulin G2a\n(IgG2a) (R&D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK) and mouse IgG1\nclone DAK-Go1 (Dako UK, Cambridge, UK), respectively). The\nnumber of positive nucleated cells was enumerated per mm2 of\nbronchial submucosa or ASM bundle by a blinded observer as\ndescribed previously.28 29\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed using PRISM Version 4.\nParametric data were expressed as mean (SEM), data that had a\nnormal log distribution were log transformed and described as\ngeometric mean (95% CI) and non-parametric data were\ndescribed as median (interquartile range (IQR)). One-way\nanalysis of variance (Kruskal\u2013Wallis for non-parametric data)\nwas used for across-group comparisons, with Tukey and Dunn\npost hoc tests for between-group comparisons. x2 tests were\nused to compare categorical data. Correlations were assessed by\nSpearman rank correlation coefficients.\nRESULTS\nSputum GM-CSF concentration in asthma and COPD\nClinical and sputum characteristics for subjects in group 1 are\nshown in table 1. The proportion of subjects with measurable\nGM-CSF in the sputum was raised in those with moderate (7\/\n14) and severe (11\/18) asthma, and in those with COPD GOLD\nstage II (7\/16), III (8\/17) and IV (7\/14) compared with controls\n(1\/18) and those with mild asthma (0\/13) (p = 0.001). The\nsputum GM-CSF concentration was increased in subjects with\nCOPD across severity compared with controls (p = 0.02\nKruskal\u2013Wallis; p,0.05 for COPD all severities compared with\ncontrols; fig 1). Similarly, the sputum GM-CSF concentration\nwas increased in severe asthma compared with mild asthma and\ncontrols, and in moderate asthma compared with mild disease\n(p,0.001 Kruskal\u2013Wallis; p,0.05 for between-group compar-\nisons; fig 1). The sputum GM-CSF concentration was increased\nin the subjects with moderate and severe asthma combined\ncompared with those with COPD GOLD II\u2013IV combined\n(p = 0.004). The sputum GM-CSF concentration was correlated\nwith the sputum eosinophilia in subjects with disease as a\nwhole group (rs = 0.28; p = 0.007), all those with asthma\n(rs = 0.3; p = 0.04) and moderate and severe disease (rs = 0.41;\np = 0.018), but not COPD. There was no association in subjects\nwith asthma or COPD with sputum GM-CSF concentration\nand percentage predicted FEV1 (r =20.26, p = 0.09; r =20.07,\np = 0.7) or the FEV1\/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio (r = 0.06,\np = 0.7; r = 0.1, p = 0.5), respectively.\nGM-CSF\/R expression in large airway tissue specimens\nExamples of GM-CSF and GM-CSFR+ cells in the bronchial\nsubmucosa in asthma are as shown in fig 2. Clinical\ncharacteristics of group 2 are as shown in table 2. The median\n(IQR) GM-CSF cells\/mm2 of submucosa was increased in severe\nasthma (1.4 (3.0)) compared with those with mild to moderate\nasthma (0 (2.5)) and healthy controls (0 (0.5)), (p = 0.004,\nKruskal\u2013Wallis; between-group comparisons are as shown\nfig 3A). The number of GM-CSFR+ cells\/mm2 of submucosa\nand ASM was increased in severe asthma (2.1 (8.4) and 2.4 (5.5))\ncompared with healthy controls (0 (1.6) and 0 (0.8), but not in\nthose with mild to moderate asthma (1.1 (5) and 1.2 (2.2))\n(p = 0.02 and p = 0.049, respectively, Kruskal\u2013Wallis; p,0.05\nsevere asthma vs control, fig 3B,C). The number of GM-CSF+\ncells in the ASM bundle was very low in subjects with asthma\nand healthy controls.\nThere were no differences in the number of GM-CSF+ or GM-\nCSFR+ cells within the submucosa or ASM bundle in lung\nAirway biology\n672 Thorax 2009;64:671\u2013676. doi:10.1136\/thx.2008.108290\nresection tissue from subjects with COPD and controls with\nand without a significant smoking history (table 3).\nDISCUSSION\nWe report here for the first time that the sputum GM-CSF\nconcentration was increased in COPD, independent of disease\nseverity, and confirm that in asthma the sputum GM-CSF\nconcentration is associated with more severe disease. In asthma\nour sputum findings were supported by increased GM-CSF and\nGM-CSFR expression in bronchial biopsies in severe disease.\nOur study therefore supports our hypothesis that GM-CSF and\nGM-CSFR expression is increased in asthma and COPD, and in\nasthma is related to disease severity.\nSeveral lines of evidence support a role for GM-CSF in\nCOPD. GM-CSF is induced by the presence of airway\npathogens30 31 and is known to be an important regulator of\nthe activation and survival of key effector cells in COPD,\nnamely the neutrophil and macrophage.32 33 Critically, neu-\ntralisation of GM-CSF in animal models attenuates airway\ninflammation in response to cigarette smoking.7 However, to\ndate there has been a paucity of direct evidence of increased\nGM-CSF expression in airway secretions. Indeed the sputum\nGM-CSF concentration was not increased in subjects at\nexacerbations compared with their stable state at recovery,34\nalthough in contrast GM-CSF release by sputum cells in\nculture was increased.18 In vivo and in vitro GM-CSF is rapidly\ninternalised following receptor binding and therefore it is\nlikely that the measurement of sputum GM-CSF is under-\nestimated by ELISA.7 35 Importantly, the concentration of free\nGM-CSF is under tight control, with measurable GM-CSF\nautoantibodies in healthy controls as well as in those with\ndisease.36 In spite of this, we here have validated the\nmeasurement of GM-CSF in sputum and found that it was\nincreased in subjects with COPD across all disease severities\ncompared with smoking and non-smoking controls, although\nthere was no relationship between sputum GM-CSF concen-\ntration and disease severity. In the resection samples, we were\nunable to confirm that expression of GM-CSF or its receptor\nwas increased. However, we only studied subjects with COPD\nwith milder disease, and the control subjects often had\nunderlying lung cancer which may have masked differences\nbetween COPD and controls. Therefore, the role of GM-CSF\nin COPD needs to be further defined, and future studies need\nto include analysis of bronchial tissue in moderate to severe\nCOPD.\nIn asthma there is a wealth of data supporting a role for GM-\nCSF. In particular GM-CSF is pivotal in eosinophil maturation\nand survival,37 a key effector cell in asthma.

In contrast to COPD,\nin asthma there are several reports of increased GM-CSF\nexpression in airway secretions and tissue.12\u201317 In particular,\nincreased sputum GM-CSF expression is associated with more\nsevere disease.12 13 We have confirmed these earlier reports and\nfound that sputum GM-CSF concentration was increased in\nmoderate to severe asthma, but not in mild disease. In addition\nthe intensity of the sputum GM-CSF expression was related to\nthe sputum eosinophilia. We report here for the first time that\nGM-CSF and GM-CSFR expression was also increased in the\nbronchial submucosa in more severe asthma. Therefore, in\nsevere asthma there is a generalised upregulation in the\nGM-CSF\/GM-CSFR axis, suggesting that this mediator may\nplay a prominent role in severe asthma.\nOur study design allowed for direct comparison of the\nsputum GM-CSF concentration in asthma and COPD, but not\nexpression in tissue as samples were obtained using different\nmethods. Comparisons in sputum GM-CSF concentrations\nwere undermined by the relative insensitivity of our assay,\nwith a large number of subjects that had concentrations below\nthe level of detection of our assay. This is likely to reflect the\nrapid internalisation of GM-CSF. In spite of this limitation we\nfound that sputum GM-CSF was increased in both COPD and\nmoderate to severe asthma, and importantly it was greater in\nmoderate to severe asthma than in COPD. Therefore, whether\nGM-CSF plays a more important role in severe asthma than in\nCOPD warrants further investigation.\nOur study has a number of possible criticisms. This is a cross-\nsectional observational study. We were unable to demonstrate\nan association between GM-CSF expression and lung function.\nWhether GM-CSF expression is related to longitudinal clinical\noutcomes such as disease progression, lung function decline and\nexacerbations requires further examination. Similarly, we are\nunable to determine whether differences observed between mild\nand severe asthma reflect disease severity or are a consequence\nof differences in treatment. Therefore, the effects of corticoster-\noids on GM-CSF need to be fully elucidated, although previous\nwork suggests that GM-CSF expression in tissue is attenuated\nby corticosteroids.39 The rapid turnover of GM-CSF in vivo\nlimits the interpretation of protein expression by ELISA and\nimmunohistochemistry. We have not defined the cellular source\nof GM-CSF or determined whether the increased expression of\nGM-CSF is associated with an increase in the total number of\ninfiltrating cells within the bronchial submucosa. In addition,\nprotein expression in tissue often reflects granular stores and\nmay underestimate GM-CSF expression in cells that release\nrather than store GM-CSF, such as T cells. Further studies are\ntherefore required to confirm our findings and to determine the\nrelative expression of GM-CSF in bronchial tissue by different\ncell types.\nIn conclusion, we found that the sputum GM-CSF concen-\ntration was increased in COPD, independent of disease severity,\nand in moderate to severe asthma. Increased bronchial\nsubmucosal expression of both GM-CSF and its receptor was\na particular feature of severe asthma. Our findings therefore do\nsupport a potential role for GM-CSF in asthma and possibly\nCOPD. Efficacy studies of therapeutic strategies targeted at\nGM-CSF are eagerly awaited and will further define the\nfunctional importance of GM-CSF in airways disease.\nAcknowledgements: Mrs Sue Mckenna and Mrs Beverley Hargadon for clinical\ncharacterisation of the subjects and Mr William Monteiro and Ms Natalie Neale for\ntechnical support.\nFunding: Asthma UK, MedImmune, DOH Clinical Scientist award (CB) and Wellcome\nSenior Clinical Fellowship (CB).\nCompeting interests: Declared.
