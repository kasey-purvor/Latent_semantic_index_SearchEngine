We compare\nand contrast the linear and the nonlinear behaviors of the two types of dynamo.\nKeywords : Dynamos; bifurcations.\n1. Introduction\nIn a recent paper Hide [1997] derived two classes\nof n-coupled self-exciting Faraday disk homopolar\ndynamos. The \frst class is based upon the orig-\ninal Hide et al. [1996] model in which a Faraday\ndisk is connected in series with a coil and an elec-\ntric motor, through which flows a current x(t).\nThe disk is rotated with angular speed y(t) by the\naction of a steady applied couple \u000b, while the arma-\nture of the motor rotates with angular speed z(t).\nThere is mechanical friction in both the disk and\nthe motor, parameterized by \u0014 and \u0015, respectively.\nThe moment of inertia of the armature is given\nby \f.\nHierarchies of this dynamo are constructed by\narranging the units in either a lattice or a ring, con-\nnecting the coil of dynamo j to the disk of dynamo\n(see [Hide, 1997] for further details of the construc-\ntion and for the n = 2 con\fguration). This class\nof dynamos has already received a lot of attention\nin the literature ([Moroz et al., 1998a, 1998b; Hide\n& Moroz, 1999; Goldbrum et al., 2000; Skeldon\n& Moroz, 1998; Hide, 1998; Moroz & Hide, 2000;\nMoroz, 2001b, 2001c]) and will not be discussed in\nany detail here. Instead we focus upon the sec-\nond class of dynamo of which a prototype com-\nprises a single Faraday disk and coil con\fguration,\nconnected in series with three electric motors (see\n[Hide, 1997] Fig. 1 for a schematic).\nIn the single disk dynamo, the motors Er, Ea\nandEc are driven into rotation with nondimensional\ntime-dependent angular speeds zc, za and zr, re-\nspectively by the currents flowing through the unit.\nFor each motor, one of the terminals meets at a\ncommon junction while the other is connected as\nfollows: Er to the rim of the disk via a brush; Ea to\nthe axle of the disk via a brush; Ec to the axle of the\ndisk via the coil. Er and Ec are in series, while Ea\nis in parallel to Ec and to the coil. A nondimension-\nalized current xc+xa flows through Er, where xc is\nthe current through Ec, and xa is that through Ea.\nThe governing equations take the form (see [Hide,\n1997] for a complete derivation)\n(1 + lr) _xc + lr _xa = xc(y \u2212 1\u2212 rr)\u2212 rrxa\n\u2212 \f(zc + hrzr) ; (1a)\n147\n148 I. M. Moroz\nFig. 1. Linear stability curves for case (i) with \u0003 = 0:5,\n\u001b = 5 and \u0017 = 1. The curves of steady and Hopf bifurca-\ntions from the trivial equilibrium state are denoted by s and\nh, respectively, while the Hopf bifurcation curve associated\nwith the nontrivial states is denoted by H . The double-zero\nbifurcation is labeled as d. Also shown are the approximate\nnonlinear transition curves between steady and chaotic, and\nperiodic and chaotic solutions.\n_xc \u2212 la _xa = \u2212xc \u2212 \fzc + raxa\n+ ha\fza ; (1b)\n_y = \u000b[1\u2212 xc(xc + xa)]\u2212 \u0014y ; (1c)\n_zc = xc \u2212 \u0015zc ; (1d)\nba _za = haxa \u2212 da\u0015za ; (1e)\nbr _zr = hr(xc + xa)\u2212 dr\u0015zr ; (1f)\nwhere the de\fnitions of the parameters are given\nin detail in [Hide, 1997]. In the discussion fol-\nlowing the presentation of these equations, Hide\n[1997] notes that if the motors are replaced by ele-\nments with resistance and inductance only (so that\n\f = ha = hr = 0), then (1) reduces to the Malkus{\nRobbins dynamo [Malkus, 1972; Robbins, 1997]. In\nthis paper we investigate an extension to the Rob-\nbins analysis, where we also set ha = hr = 0 but\nnow insist that \f 6= 0, so that the motor Ec is still\npresent in the special case where la = 0, which cor-\nresponds to case (b) studied by Robbins [1977].\nThe consequence of setting ha = hr = 0 is to\ndecouple the evolution of za and zr from the re-\nmaining equations so that, when all the parame-\nters appearing in (1) are taken to be positive, za,\nzr ! 0, and we are left with a reduced system of\nfour coupled nonlinear equations. The additional\nrequirement that la = 0 enables the simplest direct\ncomparison with case (b) to be made. (In future\nwork we shall relax this third assumption and so are\nable to investigate both cases (a) and (b) of [Rob-\nbins, 1977]). The simpli\fed system we investigate\nis therefore\n(1 + lr) _xc + lr _xa = xc(y \u2212 1\u2212 rr)\n\u2212 rrxa \u2212 \fzc ; (2a)\n_xc = \u2212xc \u2212 \fzc + raxa ; (2b)\n_y = \u000b[1 \u2212 xc(xc + xa)]\u2212 \u0014y ; (2c)\n_zc = xc \u2212 \u0015zc : (2d)\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2 we\nbriefly review that aspect of Robbins [1977] that is\nof relevance to our analysis, summarizing the bifur-\ncation behavior found in the Malkus{Robbins dy-\nnamo. In Sec. 3 we apply as much of the same\nrescaling as possible that was used in [Robbins,\n1977] to generate a set of equations which are read-\nily identi\fable as an extension to that model and\nthen contrast the linear stability analysis with the\ncorresponding analysis of [Robbins, 1977]. Sec-\ntion 4 describes selected numerical integrations of\nthe four-mode system and we draw our conclusions\nin Sec. 5, indicating possible lines of future research.\n2. The Transformed Dynamo\nEquations\nAs a prelude to a discussion of the four-mode dy-\nnamo (2) we summarize the key features of the\nRobbins\u2019 dynamo derivation and analysis.\n2.1. The Malkus{Robbins dynamo\nThe Malkus{Robbins dynamo comprises a conduct-\ning disk, driven to rotate with angular speed w(t)\nby a constant torque T , with a magnetic \feld nor-\nmal to the disk inducing a radial e.m.f. (as in [Hide\net al., 1996]). A current z(t) flowing in the disk, is\nremoved by a ring of brushes and is fed to a coil\nand external load. The coil is aligned in such a way\nThe Malkus{Robbins Dynamo with a Linear Series Motor 149\nthat its current y(t) produces a magnetic \feld to\nreinforce the original \feld.\nThe inductance of the coil, brushes and shunt\nare (Lc; Lb; Ls) and (Bc; Bb; Bs), respectively. Rob-\nbins [1977] notes that there are only two parameter\nregimes for which magnetic reversals are possible.\nThe \frst, termed case (a), is when\nLc=Bc < Ls=Bs ; Lb=Bb < Ls=Bs\nfor which stable Van der Pol oscillations occur. The\nsecond (and the relevant regime here), case (b) has\nLc=Bc > Ls=Bs ; Lb=Bb > Ls=Bs\nand with Ls = 0 is transformable to the Lorenz\nStrange Attractor equations.\nFor the sake of future comparisons, we note\nthe following correspondences between the variables\nand the parameters in the Robbins dynamo and (1):\n(Ls; Bs;Lb; Bb;Lc; Bc) ! (la; ra; lr; rr; 1; 1)\nand\n(w; z; y)  ! (y; xc + xa; xc) :\nTherefore setting Ls = 0 is equivalent to setting\nla = 0 and case (b) is equivalent to the requirement\nthat ra > la and lrra > larr.\nThe nondimensional form of the Malkus{\nRobbins dynamo is [Robbins, 1997]\n_w = R\u2212 zy \u2212 \u0017w ; (3a)\n_z = wy \u2212 z ; (3b)\n_y = \u001b(z \u2212 y) ; (3c)\nwhere R, \u0017 and \u001b are positive parameters which de-\npend upon the physical characteristics of the com-\nponents of the dynamo (the reader is referred to\n[Robbins, 1997] for a derivation of (3) as well as\nexplanations of the parameters).\nThere are three equilibrium con\fgurations:\n(w0; z0; y0) = (R=\u0017; 0; 0);\n(we; ze; ye) = (1;\u0006\np\n(R\u2212 \u0017);\u0006p(R\u2212 \u0017)) : (4)\nThe \frst equilibrium in (4) corresponds to the zero\n\feld state, while the remaining two are \fnite ampli-\ntude states. A bifurcation analysis of the zero state\nshows that Hopf bifurcations are not possible; the\nonly bifurcation is a pitchfork bifurcation to the re-\nmaining two equilibria when R = \u0017. A bifurcation\nanalysis of the \fnite amplitude states shows that a\nsubcritical Hopf bifurcation occurs [Robbins, 1977]\nfor\nRc = \u001b\u0017\n\u001b + \u0017 + 3\n\u001b \u2212 1\u2212 \u0017 : (5)\nRobbins has numerically integrated (3) for \u001b = 5\nand \u0017 = 1 for various values of R. We note that\nfor these values of \u001b and \u0017, Rc = 15. Irregular re-\nversals occur for R = 14:625, while equilibration to\na steady state occurs for R = 14:25 after an initial\nperiod of transient chaotic behavior.\nIn this paper, we shall use the same values for\n\u001b and \u0017 as far as possible to facilitate direct com-\nparisons between the two systems.\n2.2. The extended Robbins dynamo\nIn order to recast (2) into a form reminiscent of (3),\nwe introduce new variables\ny = AW \u2212 ra ; xc + xa = BZ ;\nxc = CY ; zc = DU ; t = T\u001c ;\n(6)\nwhere\nA =\n(1 + ra)(ra + rr)\nra\n; C =\n(ra + rr)p\nlr\n;\nB =\nAp\nlr\n; D =\np\nlr ;\n(7)\nwith T = lr=(ra + rr). Then (2) reduces to\nW 0 = R\u2212 \u000bZY \u2212 \u0017W ; (8a)\nZ 0 = YW \u2212 Z ; (8b)\nY 0 = \u001b(Z \u2212 Y )\u2212 \f^U ; (8c)\nU 0 = Y \u2212 \u0003U ; (8d)\nwhere\nR =\n\u00172ra\n\u001b\u0014(ra + rr)\n(ra + \u000b) ; \u0017 =\n\u0014lr\nra + rr\n;\n\u001b =\nlr(1 + ra)\nra + rr\n; \u0003 =\n\u0015lr\nra + rr\n;\n(9)\n\u000b = \u000b=\u0014 and \f^ = \u00172\f=\u00142, with derivatives now\nbeing performed with respect to \u001c . A comparison\nof (3) with (8) identi\fes the latter as the extended\nversion of the Malkus{Robbins dynamo, whose be-\nhavior we shall investigate in the next two sections.\n150 I. M. Moroz\nWe close this section with the following obser-\nvation. If we make the transformation\n(W;Z; Y;U) ! \u000b\u22121=2(\u000b1=2W;Z; Y;U) ;\nthen Eqs. (8a){(8d) are unchanged, except for the\nabsence of \u000b in (8a). As has been veri\fed in both\nthe bifurcation analysis of Sec. 3 and the numerical\nintegrations of Sec. 4, the role that this \u000b plays re-\ngarding the solutions of (8) is simply to rescale Z,\nY and U . It has no qualitative e\u000bect whatsoever on\nthe bifurcation sequences observed.\n3. Bifurcation Analysis for the\nExtended Malkus{Robbins\nDynamo\nWe now focus upon the extended Malkus{Robbins\ndynamo and identify both the equilibrium solutions\nand determine the principal bifurcations associated\nwith them. We also compare our results with those\nfor (3) as well as for the Hide et al. [1996] family of\ndynamo models whenever appropriate.\n3.1. The equilibrium solutions\nThe extended Malkus{Robbins dynamo equations\n(7) are invariant under the transformation\n(W;Z; Y;U) ! (W;\u2212Z;\u2212Y;\u2212U)\nand the equilibrium states reflect this symmetry.\nThere are three equilibrium solutions:\nW0 = (W0; Z0; Y0; U0) = (R=\u0017; 0; 0; 0) ; (10)\nwhich we term the trivial equilibrium state and\nWe = (We;WeYe; Ye; Ye=\u0003) ; (11)\nwhere\nWe = 1 +\n\f^\n\u0003\u001b\n; Ye = \u0006\ns\nR\u2212 \u0017We\n\u000bWe\n; (12)\nwhich we term the nontrivial equilibrium states.\nNote that the trivial equilibrium state is iden-\ntical to (4)a (with the obvious absence of U), while\nthe nontrivial equilibria (11) and (12) reduce to (4)b\nwhen \f = 0 and \u000b = 1.\n3.2. Bifurcations from the\ntrivial state\nA linear stability analysis of (10) for perturbations\n\/ emt yields a cubic characteristic equation for m,\ntogether with the separable root m = \u2212\u0017 < 0:\nm3 +A2m\n2 +A1m+A0 = 0 ; (13)\nwhere\nA2 = 1 + \u001b + \u0003 ; (14a)\nA1 = \u001b(1 \u2212R=\u0017) + \u0003(1 + \u001b) + \f^ ; (14b)\nA0 = \u001b\u0003(1 \u2212R=\u0017) + \f^ : (14c)\nFor ease of comparison with the Malkus{Robbins\ncase, we treat R as the principal bifurcation param-\neter. In order to compare with the results of Hide\net al. [1996], who chose \u000b, we could of course use\n(9) to express R in terms of \u000b. The essential details\nof the bifurcation analysis will then be unchanged;\nthe only di\u000berence will be a rescaled and translated\nversion of the results.\nA steady bifurcation occurs when A0 = 0 or\nRs = \u0017\n \n1 +\n\f^\n\u001b\u0003\n!\n(15)\nand a Hopf bifurcation occurs when A1A2 = A0,\nprovided A1 > 0 and A0 > 0 (A2 is automatically\npositive), when\nRh =\n\u0017(\u001b + \u0003)\n\u001b(1 + \u001b)\n[(1 + \u001b)(1 + \u0003) + \f^] ; (16)\nwith frequency given by m = \u0006i!, where\n!2 = [\f^(1\u2212 \u0015)\u2212 \u00032(1 + \u001b)]=(1 + \u001b) : (17)\nWe see that !2 > 0 provided \f^ > \u00032(1 + \u001b)=\n(1\u2212 \u0003). A double-zero Takens{Bogdanov bifurca-\ntion occurs when A0 = A1 = 0, so that\n(Rd; \f^d) =\n \n\u0017(\u0003 + \u001b)\n\u001b(1\u2212 \u0003) ;\n\u00032(1 + \u001b)\n1\u2212 \u0003\n!\n; (18)\nprovided \u0003 < 1.\nThe above is in marked contrast to the bifurca-\ntion analysis for (3), where the only bifurcation pos-\nsible for the zero state is the pitchfork bifurcation\n(corresponding to (15)). The presence of a motor\n(nonzero \f and \u0003 terms) therefore means that addi-\ntional bifurcations, similar to the Hide et al. [1996]\nproblem, are now possible.\nThe Malkus{Robbins Dynamo with a Linear Series Motor 151\n3.3. Bifurcations from the\nnontrivial states\nWe now consider the primary bifurcations that can\narise from the nontrivial equilibria (11) and (12).\nUnder perturbations of the form est, we now obtain\na nonseparable quartic characteristic equation\ns4 +B3s\n3 +B2s\n2 +B1s+B0 = 0 ; (19)\nwhere\nB3 = 1 + \u0017 + \u001b + \u0003 ; (20a)\nB2 = (1 + \u0017)(\u001b + \u0003) + \u001bWe(\u0003\u2212 1)\n+R=We ; (20b)\nB1 = \u0017\u001b(\u0003\u2212 2)We +R[\u001b + (\u001b + \u0003)=We] ; (20c)\nB0 = 2\u001b\u0003(R \u2212 \u0017We) : (20d)\nFrom (19) and (20) we see that a steady bifurca-\ntion occurs when B0 = 0, which can only occur for\nWe = R=\u0017. Comparison with (10) shows that this\ncorresponds to the pitchfork bifurcation of the triv-\nial equilibrium state. A double-zero bifurcation is\nalso possible when B0 = B1 = 0. Substitution of\nWe = R=\u0017 into B1 = 0 and use of (12)a results in\nthe same condition (18) as for the trivial equilibrium\nsolution. Therefore the extended Malkus{Robbins\ndynamo is similar to the Hide et al. [1996] dynamo\nin the coincidence of the steady and double-zero\nbifurcations for the trivial and the nontrivial equi-\nlibrium states.\nAs in [Hide & Moroz, 1999], it is not possible\nto write down a simple elegant explicit formula for\nthe onset of a Hopf bifurcation for the nontrivial\nequilibria. When s = \u0006i\u2126, we can show that Hopf\nbifurcations occur along the curve\nB21 \u2212B1B2B3 +B0B23 = 0 ; (21)\nwhere \u2126 is the common root of:\n\u21262 =\nB2\n2\n\u0006 1\n2\n[B22 \u2212 4B0]\n1\n2 =\nB1\nB3\n: (22)\nAppendix A summarizes the method we used to\ncompute the nontrivial Hopf bifurcation curve.\nNumerical calculations show that one end of the\nbranch can terminate on the double-zero bifurca-\ntion point, while the other can terminate on the\nR axis (i.e. \f = 0) at the precise value Rc given in\n[Robbins, 1997] for the onset of the subcritical Hopf\nbifurcation for the Malkus{Robbins nontrivial equi-\nlibrium state.\n3.4. Linear stability curves\nThe bifurcation analysis described above and in\n[Robbins, 1997] suggests we consider four di\u000berent\nparameter regimes:-\n(i) \u0003 < 1 and \u001b > 1 + \u0017;\n(ii) \u0003 > 1 and \u001b > 1 + \u0017;\n(iii) \u0003 < 1 and 0 < \u001b < 1 + \u0017;\n(iv) \u0003 > 1 and 0 < \u001b < 1 + \u0017.\nFrom (18) we see that the conditions on \u0003 cor-\nrespond to the existence or otherwise of the\nTakens{Bogdanov bifurcation and so the existence\nor otherwise of the bifurcating limit cycle which\noriginates from this point [see (16) and (17)].\nThe conditions on \u001b relate to the termination or\notherwise of this limit cycle on the subcritical Hopf\nbifurcation point (determined by the vanishing of\nthe denominator in the de\fnition of Rc in (5)).\nTo illustrate the four cases, we chose four typi-\ncal parameter values that are consistent with these\ninequalities and plot the linear stability curves in\nthe (\f;R)-plane for rr = 1 and appropriate values\nof \u0017. Indeed in all the numerical integrations re-\nported in this paper we set \u0017 = \u0014 = 1, so that\n\f^ = \f throughout.\n3.4.1. \u0003 < 1 and \u001b > 1 + \u0017\nAs an example of the case when \u0003 < 1 and \u001b > 1+\u0017,\nwe choose \u0003 = 0:5, \u001b = 5 and \u0017 = 1. These choices\nfor \u001b and \u0017 coincide with those used in [Robbins,\n1997] and, from (9), correspond to the choices of\n\u0014=\u0015 = 2. Since ra = \u001b\u0014=\u0017 \u2212 1, the choice of \u0014 = 1\nyields both \u0015 = 0:5 and ra = 4. The linear stabil-\nity curves are shown in Fig. 1. Both the double-\nzero and subcritical Lorenz Hopf bifurcations exist\nand the unstable limit cycle, bifurcating from Rc\nfor \f = 0, terminates at the double-zero point and\nso corresponds to the Hopf bifurcation of the non-\ntrivial equilibria, discussed in Sec. 3.3 above. In\naddition there are curves of steady and Hopf bifur-\ncation, associated with the trivial equilibrium.\nThe interested reader might compare this case\nwith that of Fig. 1 in [Hide & Moroz, 1999], which\nshows the linear stability curves (as well as summa-\nrizing the nonlinear dynamics) for the original [Hide\net al., 1996] dynamo, modi\fed by the presence of\nan azimuthal eddy current. As discussed by Hide\n152 I. M. Moroz\nFig. 2. As in Fig. 1 but for case (ii) and with \u0003 = 1:2:\nand Moroz [1999], the \f ! 0 limit of their model\nyields the Lorenz equations, as is the case here for\nthe extended Malkus{Robbins dynamo. The two\nsubcritical Hopf bifurcations, which occur on the\n\f = 0 axis, are therefore equivalent. Indeed most of\nthe cases in this subsection have their counterparts\nin the [Hide & Moroz, 1999] study.\n3.4.2. \u0003 > 1 and \u001b > 1 + \u0017\nFigure 2 shows an example of the case \u0003 > 1 and\n\u001b > 1 + \u0017, where we have now taken \u0003 = 1:2 but\nhave left \u001b, \u0017 and \u0014 (and so ra) unchanged from\nFig. 1. The double-zero condition is violated and so\nno limit cycles can bifurcate o\u000b the steady stability\ncurve (which remains stable throughout). However\nthe Lorenz subcritical Hopf bifurcation criterion (5)\nis still satis\fed and so there is a limit cycle born.\nThese linear stability curves may be compared\nwith those of Fig. 2 in [Hide & Moroz, 1999].\n3.4.3. \u0003 < 1 and 0 < \u001b < 1 + \u0017\nFor \u0003 < 1 and 0 < \u001b < 1 + \u0017, we chose \u0003 = 0:5,\n\u0017 = 1, \u0014 = 1 and \u0015 = 0:5 as in case (i) above,\nbut considered several di\u000berent values for \u001b (and\nso ra). Here we present the linear stability curves\nfor \u001b = 1:9 and \u001b = 0:1 (see Figs. 3 and 4 respec-\ntively). In both cases the double-zero bifurcation\nFig. 3. As in Fig. 1 but for case (iii) and with \u001b = 1:9.\nFig. 4. As in Fig. 3 but with \u001b = 0:1.\nexists, but not the Lorenz subcritical Hopf bifur-\ncation at \f = 0. Therefore the (subcritical) limit\ncycles which bifurcate o\u000b the nontrivial equilibria\nno longer terminate at Rc.\nHere we can compare the linear stability curves\nwith those of Fig. 5 in the original [Hide et al., 1996]\ndynamo (see also Fig. 3 of [Hide & Moroz, 1999]).\nThe Malkus{Robbins Dynamo with a Linear Series Motor 153\nFig. 5. As in Fig. 2 but for case (iv) with \u001b = 1:9.\n3.4.4. \u0003 > 1 and 0 < \u001b < 1 + \u0017\nFinally, we consider the case of \u0003 > 1 and 0 < \u001b <\n1 + \u0017. Neither Rc nor the double-zero bifurcation\nexist. Figure 5 shows the linear stability curves for\n\u0003 = \u0015 = 1:2, \u0017 = \u0014 = 1 and \u001b = 1:9. Other choices\nfor \u001b which are consistent with these inequalities\nyield similar results. The linear stability curves\nfor this \fnal case do not appear to have any coun-\nterparts in the [Hide et al., 1996] class of dynamo\nmodels and so can be viewed as a new feature that\nappears in the extended Malkus{Robbins system.\nNumerical calculations using (21) and (22)\nyield a nontrivial Hopf bifurcation curve, despite\nthe absence of Rc and the double-zero bifurcation.\nThe existence of oscillatory solutions has been veri-\n\fed by direct numerical integrations of (8) (see the\nnext section).\n4. Numerical Investigations\nIn the previous section we presented the linear\nstability analysis for (8), culminating in \fgures\ndepicting the linear stability curves. In this sec-\ntion we describe the results of numerical integra-\ntions of (8), comparing wherever appropriate with\nbehaviors found in the other studies of low-order\ndynamos. As well as phase portraits and\/or time\nseries for selected parameter values, we shall also\ndisplay our results as plots of the local maximum\namplitude of the oscillatory solutions (which arise\nthrough Hopf bifurcations) as functions of one of\nthe control parameters \f and R. This latter ap-\nproach, used to good e\u000bect in [Moroz, 2001a], yields\na transition sequence which indicates where chaotic,\nperiodic and multiple-periodic solutions might be\nfound. In all of our integrations, \u0017 = rr = 1, while\nthe other parameters were permitted to vary, de-\npending upon which case was under consideration.\n4.1. \u0003 < 1 and \u001b > 1 + \u0017\nAs well as a depiction of the linear stability curves\nfor \u0003 = 0:5, \u001b = 5 and \u0017 = 1 (as a typical exam-\nple of the \frst case we discussed above), Fig. 1 also\nshows transition boundaries between steady, peri-\nodic and chaotic solutions. Although the scenario\nin Fig. 1 resembles that of Fig. 1 in [Hide & Moroz,\n1999], the two cases di\u000ber in one respect. While\nthe region of chaotic solutions extends to the left of\nthe Hopf bifurcation curve that links Rc with the\ndouble-zero bifurcation point d (as in [Hide & Mo-\nroz, 1999], numerical integrations of (8) show that\ntransition occurs via period-doubling bifurcations\nrather than through the intermittent destabiliza-\ntion of a periodic trajectory (as in [Hide & Moroz,\n1999]). In addition, not only does the region of\nchaotic solutions extend to the left of the nontrivial\nHopf bifurcation curve H, but there is also a region\nof stable periodic solutions in the neighborhood of\nthe double-zero point (see Fig. 1). This bifurcation\npicture is also more intricate than the one found\nby Hide et al. [1996], where chaos was con\fned to\na much smaller region of parameter space in the\n(\f; \u000b)-plane.\nWe have investigated the e\u000bects of hysteresis on\nthe location of the two nonlinear transition curves\nshown in Fig. 1. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the\nhysteresis for \f = 2:3 when R is increased and de-\ncreased respectively. There are a number of di\u000ber-\nent coexisiting steady and oscillatory states. Firstly\nthe small region of chaotic states at the transition\nbetween steady and oscillatory solutions when R\nis decreased [Fig. 6(b)] co-exists with steady states\nwhen R is increased [Fig. 6(a)] for 4:83 < R < 5.\nThen a simple periodic state [Fig. 6(b)] coexisits\nwith the steady solution for 5 < R < 6:7.\nThe transition between chaotic, asymmetric\nand symmetric periodic solutions is also subject to\nhysteresis. When R is increased, the symmetric\nperiodic solution loses stability to an asymmetric\n154 I. M. Moroz\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 6.

When R is in-\ncreased through this value [Fig. 7(a)] we observe an\nasymmetric periodic orbit, but when R is decreased\n[Fig. 7(b)], we observe a noisy period-two cycle.\nHysteresis is also observed if we \fx R but vary\n\f. Figure 8(a) shows the transition sequence for\nR = 20 when \f is increased, while Fig. 8(b) shows\nthe corresponding scenario for decreasing \f. In the\nlatter case, the \frst loss of stability of the limit cy-\ncle is directly to a period-two cycle at \f \u0019 7:75 (see\nFig. 9(a) for \f = 7:65), which then loses stability to\na period-four cycle at \f \u0019 7:6 [see Fig. 9(b)]. When\n\f is increased, however, the period-two orbit loses\nstability at \f \u0019 7:75 to an asymmetric limit cycle\nbefore the restoration of symmetry at \f \u0019 8:27.\n4.2. \u0003 > 1 and \u001b > 1 + \u0017\nThe case of \u0003 = 1:2 and \u001b = 5, with \u0017 = 1, provides\none of the more interesting nonlinear scenarios con-\nsidered in this study. If \f is held \fxed and R varied\nor if R is kept \fxed and \f varied, we observe a rich\ninterleaving of periodic and chaotic solutions, with\nperiod doubling cascades, windows of periodic solu-\ntions, separated by regions of chaotic solutions, as\nwell as simple steady state solutions.\nHysteresis is again observed along the Hopf\nstability curve, being more marked when the tran-\nsition is between steady and chaotic solutions than\nbetween steady and periodic. There did not appear\nto be any hysteresis involving other transitions. For\nexample, when \f = 0:01, chaotic behavior is ob-\nThe Malkus{Robbins Dynamo with a Linear Series Motor 157\n(a) (b)\nFig. 9.

The tran-\nsition from chaotic behavior is directly to steady\nstate solutions.\nBecause of the richness of solutions in this case,\nas well as depicting some approximate transition\nboundaries in Fig. 2, we also present a selection of\ntransition curves of Wmax as functions of \f with R\nheld \fxed or vice versa. With \f held \fxed and R\nvaried, chaotic solutions predominate for 0 \u0014 \f \u0014 5\nwith a barely discernable window of periodic solu-\ntions for \f = 5 and 31:85 < R < 32:05. When\n\f = 7:5, there is a small band of chaotic states at\nthe linear stability boundary, giving way to a sim-\nple periodic solution for 10 < R < 15:3. Windows\nof periodic states, interleaving regions of chaotic\nbehavior then appear. Figure 10(a) shows the sce-\nnario for \f = 10. When \f = 20 [Fig. 10(b)],\nnearly all of these periodic windows have disap-\npeared, while for \f = 30 periodic solutions pre-\ndominate. There is still a small region of chaotic\nsolutions away from the Hopf stability boundary,\nwhich gives rise again to interleaving of periodic and\nchaotic states for \f = 40 and \f = 50 (see Fig. 11).\nSimilar intricate behavior can be found when R\nis held \fxed and \f is varied. Figure 12 shows the\ntransition sequence for R = 25.\nIn contrast to the \frst case described above,\ntherefore, the region of parameter space for the ex-\nistence of oscillatory solutions covers a wider range\nof values of \f and much smaller values of \u000b than in\n[Hide & Moroz, 1999].\n4.3. \u0003 < 1 and 0 < \u001b < 1 + \u0017\nWhen \u0003 = 0:5, \u001b = 1:9 and \u0017 = 1, the region of pa-\nrameter space occupied by chaotic solutions is now\ngreatly reduced, compared to the above two cases.\nThere is again a marked hysteresis involving the lo-\ncation of the steady-chaotic and the steady-periodic\ntransition to the left of the nontrivial Hopf bifurca-\ntion curve. For example when \f = 1:0, the tran-\nsition from steady to periodic occurs at R \u0019 7:4\nwhen R is increasing, whereas the opposite tran-\nsition from periodic to chaotic occurs at R \u0019 5\nwhen R is decreasing. There is also hystersis at\nthe periodic{chaotic boundary to the right of the\nnontrivial Hopf curve, but this is less marked, with\ntransition values di\u000bering by only 0:1 or 0:2.\nWhen \u001b = 0:1, with all the remaining param-\neters kept the same, the (\f;R)-plane is dominated\nby simple periodic or steady solutions, with chaos\nbeing con\fned to an initially narrow band close to\nthe nontrivial Hopf bifurcation curve, this narrow\nband broadening out for larger values of R.\n4.4. \u0003 > 1 and 0 < \u001b < 1 + \u0017\nFor the \fnal case, we took \u0003 = 1:2, \u0017 = 1 and\n\u001b = 1:9.

Figure 13 shows the\ntransition sequence for R = 50 for 0 < \f < 60.\n5. Discussion\nIn this paper we have investigated an extension of\nthe celebrated Malkus{Robbins dynamo, which fea-\ntures as a special limit of one of the hierarchy of\nself-exciting coupled Faraday-disk homopolar dy-\nnamos proposed by Hide [1997]. We have identi\fed\nand studied four cases of interest which allow or\nforbid certain key bifurcations. Moreover we have\ncompared the behaviors obtained for these cases\nwith those found in the original Malkus{Robbins\ndynamo as well as in some of the other self-exciting\ndynamo models.\nThe presence of a linear series motor greatly\nenriches the range of possible behaviors in the\nMalkus{Robbins dynamo to include not only\ncodimension-one Hopf bifurcations for both the\ntrivial and the nontrivial equilibria but also the\ncodimension-two double-zero bifurcation which is a\ncharacteristic feature of the Hide et al. [1996] family\nof dynamos. There are extensive regions of chaotic\nand periodic states with interleaving between the\ntwo in the form of windows of periodicity and chaos.\nThere is also evidence for hysteresis in the neighbor-\nhoods of some of the linear and nonlinear transition\nboundaries between steady, periodic and chaotic so-\nlutions, with coexistence of di\u000berent types of \fnite\namplitude states for the same parameter values.\nThe special limit of Case 3 of [Hide, 1997] con-\nsidered here is one of the simplest reductions of this\nthird class of dynamo and represents a \frst step\nin its analysis. In future work we will build upon\nThe Malkus{Robbins Dynamo with a Linear Series Motor 161\nthe results of this paper and restore some of the\nneglected components of Case 3 to investigate the\ne\u000bects of their reinclusion.\nAcknowledgment\nWe are grateful to Prof. R.
