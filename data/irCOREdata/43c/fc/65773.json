To achieve this, the RAKE receiver con-\ntinuously searches for multipath components with significant\nenergy content. Since the number of resolved multipath compo-\nnents and their relative power are a function of the transmitted\nfrequency and bandwidth [1], [2], it is desirable to characterize\nthe two 60-MHz frequency bands from simultaneous measure-\nments using a measurement technique that enables the process-\ning of the data with different bandwidths. The comparison of\nadjacent 5-MHz bands and between corresponding uplink and\ndownlink bands provides information on the possible frequency\nallocation for a particular user and whether the information\nderived from the uplink multipath structure can be used for\nthe transmission of downlink information and vice versa. The\nestimation of the window over which significant multipath\nenergy is likely to arrive helps determine the width of the search\nengine of the RAKE receiver.\nDespite the significant number of measurement cam-\npaigns both indoor and outdoor, the different frequency band\nmeasurements tended to be performed at frequencies with\nconsiderable frequency separation [3]\u2013[5]. Apart from the\nsimultaneous measurements over 10-MHz bandwidth, where\n195-kHz sections of the bandwidth were analyzed to determine\nthe frequency correlation function of the channel for Global\nSystem for Mobile Communications systems [6], and the 72- to\n90-MHz bandwidth measurements at 1.8 GHz processed with\n18-MHz resolution [2], there were no simultaneous compar-\native measurements in the frequency-division duplex (FDD)\nbands of 3G mobile radio systems. In an attempt to compare\nthe FDD channels, single 15-MHz band measurements were\nused in [7]. Other reported FDD measurements were mainly\nconcerned with the estimation of the angle of arrival and were\nperformed with either 20-MHz bandwidth [8] or 5-MHz band-\nwidth [9]. Since the power in a resolved multipath component\nvaries with frequency and bandwidth, and since 190 MHz\nseparates the two FDD channels of 3G systems, it is important\nto simultaneously obtain measurements over the two bands.\nTo fully characterize the 3G FDD channels, the single-\nfrequency sounder reported in [1] was upgraded to a dual-\nband sounder, which simultaneously transmits and receives at\n1945 and 2135 MHz with 60-MHz bandwidth [10]. This paper\npresents the results of time delay dispersion measurements\nobtained with the sounder over the entire two 60-MHz UMTS\nbands. These measurements were performed in the dense urban\nenvironment of Manchester city center using both a trolley\n0018-9545\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\n2832 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 56, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2007\nand a van, which give characteristic data of typical pedestrian\nand vehicular mobile radio users. Nine different routes of up\nto 1.77-km transmit\u2013receive distances were covered with the\ntrolley, and a 4.1-km route was covered in the van. A total of\n58 388 impulse responses were collected at 581 local areas:\n56 locations collected in the van and 525 locations in the trolley\nmeasurements.\nIn this paper, the measurement system is briefly described,\nfollowed by a description of the measurement environment\nand the data processing. Medium-scale and large-scale results\nfor the root-mean-square (rms) delay spread and the width of\nthe profile are presented for the 5- and 60-MHz frequency\nresolutions. The distance and path loss dependency of the chan-\nnel parameters are also studied and compared with previously\nreported studies. A model that relates the rms delay spread to\ndistance and excess path loss is fitted to the measured data. The\ntrolley data were primarily used in the analysis as the number\nof locations surveyed in the van was limited, and the receive\nantenna height was different from that used in the trolley.\nII. MEASUREMENTS\nA. Measurement System\nDetails of the dual-band channel sounder can be found in [10]\nand [11]. Briefly stated, the sounder employs a state-of-the-art\ndigital chirp technique, which provides full programmability of\nthe waveform parameters such as bandwidth, sweep repetition\nfrequency (SRF), time delay window, carrier frequency, and\nDoppler resolution. The time delay resolution provided by the\nchirp technique is ideally inversely proportional to the swept\nbandwidth, and the unambiguous Doppler coverage is equal\nto \u00b1SRF\/2. The sounder employs heterodyne detection, which\nenables the processing of data either over the whole bandwidth\nor subdividing it into sections to study the frequency depen-\ndence of the channel [2], [12]. For example, in this paper, the\n60-MHz samples are divided into 12 sections to obtain the\n5-MHz channel characteristics for wideband CDMA systems.\nSounder performance was verified from various back-to-\nback tests, including the ambiguity function to determine the\nresolution of the sounder in both time delay and Doppler shift,\nand the two-tone test to verify its linearity [11]. In this paper, the\n5-MHz power delay profile (PDP) as a function of frequency\nover the two bands is presented in Fig. 1 to show that all the\nfrequency sections have identical resolution, and the amplitude\nvariations across each 60-MHz band are less than 1 dB.\nThe transmit and receive antennas are vertically polarized\nomnidirectional with 7- and 3-dB gains, respectively. The ef-\nfective radiated power is 34 dBm. The measurements were\nsimultaneously conducted at 1945 and 2135 MHz with 60-MHz\nbandwidths and with either 100- or 250-Hz SRF giving unam-\nbiguous Doppler ranges of \u00b150 or \u00b1125 Hz, respectively. This\ncorresponds to maximum relative speeds of 27 and 67.5 km\/h,\nwhich are adequate to cover speeds in a high-density traffic\nenvironment. The unambiguous time delay window depends on\nthe low-pass filter bandwidth, transmitted bandwidth, and SRF.\nFor the present measurements, the time delay windows were\n16.66, 27.5, and 41.66 \u00b5s.\nFig. 1. Sounder performance as a function of frequency (a) uplink and\n(b) downlink.\nB. Measurement Environment\nMeasurements were performed in the dense urban environ-\nment of Manchester city center in areas with high user density\nsuch as train stations, shopping areas, tunnels, and both narrow\nand wide streets. Various types of street orientations (radial,\noblique, and circumferential) were covered. The city center\nmainly consists of seven- to ten-story buildings and a few 15-\nto 20-story buildings. The terrain and building profiles can be\nconsidered to be representative of many large European city\ncenters, as can be seen in Fig. 2(a).\nThe transmit antenna was located 46 m above street level, and\nthe receive antenna was 1.75 m above ground for the trolley and\n2.5 m for the van. The map in Fig. 2(b) shows the measurement\narea. Due to the scale of the map, only six of the trolley routes\n(routes 1\u20133 and 6\u20138) are indicated. Channel data were acquired\nfor the duration of 0.5\u20131 s, i.e., collecting each run consisting of\n50\u2013250 consecutive impulse responses, at each local area. The\ndistance between local areas was about 20\u201340 m. The speed of\nthe receiver was 30\u201360 km\/h for the van and 1.5\u20133 m\/s for the\ntrolley measurements. Due to the movement of vehicles in the\ntraffic, some of the measurements were taken while the receiver\nSALOUS AND GOKALP: MEDIUM- AND LARGE-SCALE CHARACTERIZATION OF UMTS-ALLOCATED FDD CHANNELS 2833\nFig. 2. (a) Measurement environment of the Manchester city center. (b) Map\nof the Manchester city center indicating some of the routes (grid line separation\nis 500 m).\nwas stationary. A record of the measurement location was kept\nduring the field trials, and the range from the transmitter was\nsubsequently calculated from scaled maps.\nC. Processing of Data\nThe data were processed to obtain the time-variant impulse\nresponse for each run using the fast Fourier transform algo-\nrithm. Each PDP was then obtained by averaging the instan-\ntaneous PDPs for each local area. Due to the variations in\nreceiver speed, these profiles represent either temporal averages\n(receiver stationary) or spatial averages (receiver moving).\nPDPs obtained from both types of averaging exhibited dif-\nferences between uplink and downlink, where the temporal\nprofiles showed finer and denser multipath components, and the\nspatial profiles were smoother [10]. The data were examined\nfor the type of averaging by estimating the average Doppler for\neach 0.5- to 1-s run. The percentage of locations with Doppler\nshift was about 28%.\nIn spatial averaging, it is usual to average a number of\ninstantaneous PDPs over tens of wavelengths. It is, however,\nnecessary to consider the distance traveled by the mobile in\nrelation to the time delay resolution of the sounder. For ex-\nample, in the measurements reported by Cox [13] and Bajwa\nand Parsons [14], an average PDP was obtained over 5\u201330 and\n5 m, respectively, where the corresponding resolutions of the\nsounders were 30 m. It is therefore appropriate to define the\nduration (or distance) over which an average delay profile is\nFig. 3. PDPs showing the movement of the peak over 1-s measurement with\nthe solid line showing the average over the first 0.5 s and the dashed line for the\nsecond 0.5 s.\nobtained as the interval during which the multipath components\ndo not move by more than half a delay bin. This can be\nrelated to the maximum observed Doppler shift. For example,\nfor a 60-MHz bandwidth, the ideal range resolution is equal\nto 5 m. For 1 s of integration time, this limits the maximum\nDoppler shift to 33.3 Hz. For higher Doppler shifts, the time\ninterval for averaging should be a fraction of a second, as shown\nin Fig. 3 for a measurement with 70-Hz Doppler shift. The\nfigure shows the movement of the peak from one time delay bin\nto another over 1 s due to the high Doppler shift. This results\nin smearing of the delay profile, where the same multipath\ncomponent is detected in several range bins and affects the\noverall estimate of the received power and rms delay spread.\nFor the trolley data, the highest detected Doppler shift was\non the order of 35 Hz, which is close to the above limit. The\nmaximum Doppler shift experienced in the van measurements\nwas 80 Hz. In this paper, the time averages were obtained over\n0.5\u20131 s, which correspond to spatial distances between 0.75 and\n12 m (3\u201380 wavelengths). Therefore, the observed small-scale\ndifferences between the two frequency bands detected in this\npaper can be attributed to the variations of the relative phase\nwith frequency of the multipath components, which are not\nresolved within the time delay bin. Time averages of over 1 s\nwere also reported in the study carried out by Seidel et al. [15].\nThe PDPs were obtained for each band either with 60-MHz\nresolution or with 5-MHz resolution, as shown in Fig. 4, for a\nmeasurement obtained while the van was on the move, which\ncorresponds to a spatial average over 7 m. Both the 60-MHz\nand the 5-MHz PDPs show differences between uplink and\ndownlink for both bandwidths despite the spatial averaging.\nOccasionally, in-band interference, which was assumed to be\ndue to predeployment field trials, is detected in the measure-\nments, as seen in Fig. 5(a) and (b) for two different sweeps\ncollected within 870 ms. The effect of interference in a chirp\nsystem has been previously studied by Shearman and Unsal\n[17], who have shown that narrowband interference raises the\nnoise floor of the compressed chirp signal, hence reducing the\n2834 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 56, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2007\nFig. 4.

(b) 5-MHz resolution over\nthe 12 sections for (left) uplink and (right) downlink.\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as shown in Fig. 5(c), for two\n5-MHz frequency sections. Due to the higher processing gain\nobtained with the 60-MHz bandwidth, the effect of interference\nis more pronounced with the 5-MHz sections. Enhancement of\nthe SNR can be achieved either by clipping the interference\nor by choosing interference free sweeps [2], [11] to determine\nthe PDP, as seen in Fig. 5(d) for the same frequency sections\nof Fig. 5(c).\nTo verify the spatial averaging distance for the present data,\n30 files obtained from vehicular measurements were processed\nto obtain PDPs averaged over a different number of sweeps\nequal to 5, 10, 25, and 50 sweeps (20, 40, 100, and 250 ms)\nfor both 60- and 5-MHz resolutions. This gives 5 to 50 PDPs\nin 1 s, which corresponds to different spatial averages depend-\ning on the vehicle\u2019s speed. The profiles were then used to\nestimate the rms delay spread, and the number of runs was\nsubsequently entered into the tables in [16] to determine the\nstationary distance for averaging. It was found that for 30-\nto 80-Hz Doppler shifts, the spatial averaging distance should\nnot exceed 3 m with a minimum averaging distance of four\nto six wavelengths, i.e., 60\u201390 cm for the 60-MHz resolution,\nwhereas for the 5-MHz resolution, the stationary distance could\nbe in excess of the distance traveled in the 1-s interval. This\nconfirms the previous statement regarding the relation between\nDoppler shift and resolution bandwidth. Each PDP was verified\nfor a minimum of 25-dB SNR threshold. When any of the\nresulting profiles for any frequency section for either band did\nnot satisfy the SNR criterion, the run was eliminated from the\noverall cumulative distribution for all sections for both links\nto ensure the same number of points for each section. The\nprofiles were subsequently used to extract small-scale channel\nparameters such as average delay, rms delay spread, path loss,\nand the 15-dB width of the profile down from the peak (time\nbetween the first and the last time a threshold level is crossed).\nSALOUS AND GOKALP: MEDIUM- AND LARGE-SCALE CHARACTERIZATION OF UMTS-ALLOCATED FDD CHANNELS 2835\nFig. 5. Two sweeps separated by 850 ms with (a) no interference and (b) with interference. PDP for two 5-MHz sections (c) without interference clipping and\n(d) with interference clipping.\nThe small-scale channel parameters were combined to ob-\ntain either medium-scale characterization, i.e., for each route\nas shown in Fig. 6(a)\u2013(d), or large-scale characterization by\ncombining the data from all the routes. The characterization\nincludes cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) for each fre-\nquency band separately either with 60-MHz resolution or with\n5-MHz resolution, and probability distribution histograms of\nthe difference between the uplink and downlink parameters on\na local area basis for all the routes for both 60- and 5-MHz\nresolutions.\nTo study the effect of transmit\u2013receive distance (range) and\npath loss on the measured channel parameters, data from all\nthe trolley routes were grouped into three subgroups. The three\nrange groups correspond to 500 m for the first two groups\nand 770 m for the third group. The three path loss groups\ncorrespond to 78\u201398, 98\u2013118, and 118\u2013138 dB. In addition,\nscatter plots of rms delay spread as a function of distance, path\nloss, and excess path loss were produced.\nIII. MEDIUM-SCALE AND LARGE-SCALE\nCHARACTERIZATIONS\nIn this section, the distributions of channel parameters for\nsome of the routes are discussed for both 60- and 5-MHz\nresolutions.\nA. Route Variability (Medium Scale)\nThe PDPs for each route as a function of local area were\nconcatenated, as shown in Fig. 6, for both uplink and downlink\nfor routes one and eight of the trolley measurements (medium-\nscale area). The profiles are normalized each with respect to\nits own peak and show the dependency of PDP on frequency\nand location. Figs. 6 and 7 demonstrate that the extent of delay\nspread is a function of distance from the transmitter, street\nwidth, surrounding environment, and the route orientation with\nrespect to the transmitter. For example, route one [Fig. 6(a)]\ncovers narrow streets within the 500-m radius of the transmitter\nwith 50% of the locations being along radial streets. The\nbuilding heights along the route vary between five and seven\nstories. Route eight [Fig. 2(b)] covered the heart of the city\ncenter, including an open garden area and a shopping square.\nThe covered streets were either circumferential or oblique with\nonly 35% of the locations within 500 m from the transmitter\nand 11% between 1000 and 1100 m. The profiles acquired\nin the shopping square had a number of peaks and exhibited\ndifferences between the two 60-MHz bands. Fig. 7(b) and (d)\nalso shows that an increase in path loss in excess of 120 dB from\nlocation 40 corresponded to an increase in rms delay spread.\nIn these areas, the direct path was heavily shadowed, and the\nreceiver was on circumferential streets at ranges greater than\n700 m away from the transmitter and had a direct view of a\nnumber of 15- to 20-story buildings and buildings with metallic\nsidewalls.\nThe cdfs for the rms delay spread of these two routes, which\nrepresent minimum spread and relatively high delay spread,\nare shown in Fig. 8(a) for 60-MHz resolution and in Fig. 8(c)\nfor one of the 5-MHz frequency sections. Two observations\ncan be made: 1) The channel parameters are a function of\nthe analysis bandwidth; and 2) the frequency dependence of\nthe channel parameters is a function of the route orientation.\nFor example, for route one, the channel parameters for both\nresolution bandwidths are similar for both uplink and downlink,\nwhereas for route eight, considerable frequency differences are\nobserved.\n2836 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 56, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2007\nFig. 6. PDP as a function of location for (a) route one uplink, (b) route one downlink, (c) route eight uplink, and (d) route eight downlink.\nThe variability between the different routes is assessed from\nthe 90% values scaled from the cdf for each route for both\n60- and 5-MHz resolution bandwidths. Fig. 9 displays the 90%\nvalues for the rms delay spread obtained with the 60-MHz\nresolution for the (solid line) uplink and (dashed line) downlink\nfor the ten routes, where routes one to nine represent trolley\nroutes, and route ten represents the van route. For visual clarity,\nnote that in the figure, the downlink lines have been shifted\nto the right by a quarter of a number. Also shown in the figure is\nthe corresponding 90% rms delay spread range of values over\nthe twelve 5-MHz sections for both (circles) uplink and (stars)\ndownlink. The figure shows the route variability between the\ntwo 60-MHz bands and also between the 5-MHz sections across\nthe FDD bands. Large variations are seen to occur between\nthe FDD bands for each user, and these can be significantly\ndifferent from those experienced by another user operating on\na different section of the spectrum.\nComparing the results for the two resolution bandwidths in\nshadowed routes (i.e., routes three, seven, eight, and ten), the\nvalues for the rms delay spread from the 5-MHz resolution are\nconsiderably varied and tend to be larger than the corresponding\nvalues obtained with 60 MHz for either link. This indicates\nthat the 60-MHz results cannot be directly used to indicate the\n5-MHz dispersion along shadowed routes but can be consid-\nered more applicable to routes with low path loss values, i.e.,\nboth radial and narrow streets. The differences between the\ntwo bandwidths on shadowed locations are due to frequency-\nselective fading effects, which are more pronounced when the\nline of sight is heavily attenuated. Route nine was mainly along\nradial streets and, hence, experienced small dispersion.\nComparing the 60-MHz values, the largest differences for\nthe 90% rms values were detected along routes eight and ten\n(van), and had values equal to 0.6 and 0.3 \u00b5s, respectively.\nAn important parameter in the design of equalizers and RAKE\nreceivers is the width of the profile. The largest 15-dB width\ndifference between the two links was detected along route seven\nand was on the order of 8.3 \u00b5s for the 60-MHz resolution and\n16 \u00b5s for the eighth frequency section with 5-MHz resolution.\nThe percentage route variability of the channel parameters\nwas calculated from the ratio of the standard deviation to the\nSALOUS AND GOKALP: MEDIUM- AND LARGE-SCALE CHARACTERIZATION OF UMTS-ALLOCATED FDD CHANNELS 2837\nFig. 7.

For the 90% rms delay spread,\nthe mean and percentage variabilities were equal to 1.1 \u00b5s\nand 50.7%, and 1.0 \u00b5s and 40.1%, for uplink and downlink,\nrespectively. These figures indicate that although the mean\nvalues for the two links are of similar order, the variability about\nthe mean is quite high.\n2838 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 56, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2007\nFig. 9. Ninety percent of cdf of rms delay spread as a function of route\nnumber. Solid line with circles: uplink with 5-MHz resolution; solid line\nwith star: downlink with 5-MHz resolution; solid line: uplink with 60-MHz\nresolution; and dashed line: downlink with 60-MHz resolution.\nB. Large-Scale Characterization\nLarge-scale characterization is achieved in two ways. First,\nsmall-scale parameters were pooled from all the data to gen-\nerate a single cdf (large scale) for each band, as shown in\nFig. 10(a) and (b) for the rms delay spread and the 15-dB width\nof the profile for the 60-MHz bandwidth. The figure shows that,\nin general, the values for the two links are similar. This is due\nto the environment around the transmitter location, which is\nmainly characterized by radial streets and small streets. The\nlocations, which exhibited shadow fading and were in sight\nof high-rise buildings, constituted only a small percentage of\nthe measured locations and, hence, only affected the maximum\nvalues of the cdf.\nSecond, since the measurements at the two frequency bands\nwere performed simultaneously, histograms of the difference at\neach location were computed as shown in Fig. 11(a) for the rms\ndelay spread and Fig. 11(b) for the 15-dB width of the profiles\nobtained with 60-MHz resolution. The figures show that the\ndifference values appear to be slightly biased to the left, i.e.,\nthe downlink experiences more spread than the uplink. For the\n15-dB width, this bias was up to 2 \u00b5s, and for values greater\nthan 2 \u00b5s, the bias was to the right. It was found that both the\nrms delay spread values and the 15-dB width values were higher\nfor the downlink band for 55% of the time.\nThe highest detected difference for the 15-dB width from the\nhistograms in Fig. 11 was on the order of 15.6 \u00b5s in comparison\nto the 8 \u00b5s obtained from the all-route cdf. This shows that\nwhile having a larger pool of data might reduce the bias in\nthe histograms, the differences between the two links in certain\nlocations can still be considerably higher than can be deduced\nfrom the cdf.\nFig. 12 shows similar histograms for two of the 5-MHz\nsections for the rms delay spread and the 15-dB width of\nthe profiles. To asses the extent of variations as a function\nof frequency and bandwidth, the statistics for the percentage\nof locations for which the difference in the rms delay spread\nbetween the two links was greater by 100\u2013500 ns in 100-ns\nsteps were scaled for both 60- and 5-MHz resolutions. Also,\nvalues for the 15-dB width for which the difference between\nthe two links was greater than 0.5, 1\u20133, and 5 \u00b5s were scaled.\nFor the 5-MHz sections, an average was obtained, and the\nresults for the rms delay spread and 15-dB width are shown in\nTables I and II, respectively. The tables show that higher differ-\nences can be detected with the 5-MHz bandwidth than with the\n60-MHz bandwidth.\nC. Distance and Path Loss Dependency of Time Dispersion\nDistance and path loss dependence of the rms delay spread\nare studied using the trolley data only as few data points were\ncollected with the van, and these were measured at a different\nantenna height. Regression analysis is applied to the data and\na model, which takes into account both distance and excess\npath loss.\nAlso, the data were pooled into three groups according to two\ncriteria, i.e., distance (range) and path loss. The first, second,\nand third range groups were for transmit\u2013receive distances\nof 10\u2013500, 500\u20131000, and 1000\u20131770 m, respectively (few\ndata points were collected beyond 1770 m). The numbers of\nobservations in each distance group were 262, 175, and 88,\nrespectively. The data were also grouped according to path\nloss with groups from 78\u201398, 98\u2013118, and 118\u2013138 dB. The\nnumbers of measurement locations in path loss group one, two,\nand three were 145, 298, and 82, respectively, for 60-MHz\nresolution. The cdf for the rms delay spread and the 15-dB\nwidth for 60-MHz resolution are shown in Fig. 13(a) and (b) for\nrange and Fig. 13(c) and (d) for path loss, and Table III contains\na summary of the 90% values and the median values of the\ncdf for both frequency resolutions. The 5-MHz range of values\nis shown in parenthesis. Generally, the channel parameters are\nobserved to increase for both 5- and 60-MHz resolutions with\ndistance and path loss, which is similar to the model proposed\nin [18]. The explanation offered in [18] for distance dependence\nwas related to the attenuation experienced by the direct path\nand local scatterers as the receiver moves further away from the\ntransmitter.\nTable III shows a significant sudden increase in channel\nparameters for the third group regardless of distance or path\nloss. Also, significant differences are observed across the 12\nfrequency sections and between the FDD band parameters pri-\nmarily for the third group. These variations can be attributed to\nthe shadowing of the direct path, which causes the contribution\nfrom echoes with larger excess time delays to be detected, such\nas those from high-rise buildings, thus increasing the value of\nrms delay spread. This also enhances the differences between\nthe different frequency bands as the different multipath compo-\nnents fade differently with frequency, as can be seen in Fig. 4.\nGenerally, fewer variations across the different frequency bands\nand between sections were observed in the presence of the\nline-of-sight component. The effect of shadowing can also be\nobserved in Fig. 7 and from the scatter plot of rms delay\nspread versus distance in Fig. 14, which show small multipath\ndispersion at large distances when the receiver moved to a less\nshadowed area.\nTo verify some of the assumptions proposed by\nGreenstein et al. [18], the rms delay spread data were fitted to\nlognormal, Nakagami, Rayleigh, Rice, Suzuki, and Weibull dis-\ntributions, and the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov goodness-of-fit was\nSALOUS AND GOKALP: MEDIUM- AND LARGE-SCALE CHARACTERIZATION OF UMTS-ALLOCATED FDD CHANNELS 2839\nFig. 10.

Histograms of the difference between uplink and downlink on a local area basis with 60-MHz (a) RMS delay spread and (b) 15-dB width.\nused to indicate the suitability of the distribution. It was\nfound that the lognormal distribution had the best fit for\nthe rms delay spread from all the locations as suggested by\nGreenstein et al. [18].\nIn an attempt to study the correlation between delay spread,\ndistance, and path loss, Greenstein et al. [18] proposed a model\nbased on scaled values of cdf from a number of published\npapers. The model assumes that the delay spread at a particular\ndistance follows a lognormal distribution. The model gives\nrelationships for the median delay spread of an area (\u03c4med)\nto distance and the median delay spread at 1 km (T1). The\nrelationship is distance raised to a value between 0.5 and 1\nfor terrain ranging from urban to mountainous. The relevant\nequation for urban areas is given by\n\u03c4med(area) = 0.76T1d0.5max (1)\nwhere dmax is the maximum radius of the area of\nmeasurements.\nAn attempt was made to apply (1) to our measurements.\nSince the model assumes uniform distribution, and since most\nof our measurements in the 900- to 1100-m range were in\nshadowed locations, (1) was rewritten in the form of\n\u03c42(med)\n\u03c41(med)\n=\n(\nd2\nd1\n)\u03b5\n(2)\nand used to estimate the value of \u03b5 using the measured values\nof rms delay spread at 300 m (150 points), 500 m (105 points),\nand 700 m (60 points) by taking data points in 200-m intervals.\nTo avoid the bias due to the varying number of samples in each\ngroup, the same number of data points, i.e., 60 points, was used\nto estimate the median.\nFor these distances, the median rms delay spread was 0.47,\n0.42, and 0.49 \u00b5s, which gives a value for \u03b5 equal to 0.56 for\nmaximum distances of 600 and 800 m, and 0.04 for maximum\ndistances of 400 and 800 m. While the first value is close to the\nproposed 0.5 factor, the second value is significantly smaller.\nThis indicates a weak dependence of the rms delay spread on\ndistance as can be seen from the median values for the three\ndistances where the median for the first group is higher than for\nthe second group. This can also be confirmed from the median\n2840 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 56, NO. 5, SEPTEMBER 2007\nFig. 12.

This also gives a small\nvalue of \u03b5, which is about 0.1.\nDevasirvatham [19] also attempted to relate distance and rms\ndelay spread and found inconsistencies between different sets\nof measurements and also found that the rms delay spread oc-\ncasionally decreased for long distances. This was also observed\nin this paper, where the smallest rms delay spread of 15 ns was\ndetected at 2.5 km away from the transmitter. It is interesting,\nhowever, that Greenstein et al. [18] used the scatter plot of\nrms delay spread versus received power of Devasirvatham [19]\nto prove their distance relationship, where \u03b5 is deduced to be\nequal to 0.48.\nIn [19], a different fit between the logarithm of the rms\ndelay spread and the received power (normalized with respect\nto 0.3 m) was given, which was also found to not be suitable.\nThis could be attributed to the environment, where in [19]\nthe measurements were conducted in small cities and covered\nshort distances. In addition, most buildings were three stories\nor lower, and the transmit and receive antenna heights were\n1.8 and 9.1 m, respectively. Due to the low antenna heights,\npropagation is governed by the scatterers in the vicinity of the\nmobile. Although low antenna heights mean higher path loss\nSALOUS AND GOKALP: MEDIUM- AND LARGE-SCALE CHARACTERIZATION OF UMTS-ALLOCATED FDD CHANNELS 2841\nFig. 13.

Scatter plot of rms delay spread versus transmit\u2013receive range in\nmeters. + is the trolley data, and o is the van data.\nvalues, which could result in high rms delay spread values,\nas the antenna heights are decreased, the antennas become\nvisible to fewer scattering objects at greater distances. This\ngives smaller rms delay spread values.\nFor the present measurements, a suitable fit relating the rms\ndelay spread in nanoseconds to the path loss in decibels for the\ntwo links\nloge \u03c4rms (in nanoseconds) = 2.43 + 0.0358PL (in decibels)\n(3.a)\nloge \u03c4rms (in nanoseconds) = 2.92 + 0.0309PL (in decibels)\n(3.b)\n[(3.a) uplink and (3.b) downlink] was found from all the trolley\nmeasurements for the distance between 110 and 1.77 km, where\nthe measured range of path loss was between 78 and 138 dB.\nTo isolate the interdependence between path loss and distance,\nas in [20], a scatter plot between rms delay spread and excess\npath loss EPL was computed using first regression analysis to\nfind the path loss coefficients and subsequently by taking the\ndifference between the measured path loss and the regression\nfit. The path loss coefficients were found to be 2.56 and 2.42\nfor both uplink and downlink, respectively. Equation (3) can\nthen be rewritten in terms of the excess path loss as\nloge \u03c4rms (in nanoseconds) = 0.0358EPL (in decibels)\n+ 0.916 log10 d (in meters)\n+ 3.73 (4.a)\nloge \u03c4rms (in nanoseconds) = 0.0309EPL (in decibels)\n+ 0.748 log10 d (in meters)\n+ 4.14. (4.b)\nThe model of (4) shows a linear relationship with excess\npath loss but a logarithmic relationship with distance. For the\nrange of variations in EPL (see Fig. 15) and d, the delay spread\nvariations are more affected by the increase of excess path loss\nFig. 15. Scatter plot of rms delay spread versus excess path loss for trol-\nley data.\nthan with distance. This result might be of relevance to cell\nplanning since more dispersion leads to more complex system\ndesign.\nThe scatter plot of rms delay spread versus excess path loss\nfor the uplink shown in Fig. 15 also indicates an exponential\nrelationship between rms delay spread and excess path loss.\nThus, regression analysis was performed using the natural\nlogarithm of delay spread in nanoseconds, excess path loss\nEPL in decibels, and distance in meters. The results were then\ncompared with (4), and the maximum difference between the\ntwo fits was found to be 80 ns.\nIn [21], an overbound exponential fit between rms delay\nspread and path loss was given, where the path loss was normal-\nized with respect to 1 m. The model given in [21] was found to\nbe not suitable for our measurements. This could be attributed\nto the difference in antenna height, where the measurements\nreported in [21] were conducted with transmit antenna heights\nbetween 3.7 and 13.3 m, whereas the measurements reported\nhere were conducted with a transmit antenna height of 46 m.\nFinally, the correlation coefficients between rms delay spread\nand distance, and rms delay spread and excess path loss, were\ncomputed. The correlations with distance for the uplink and\ndownlink values were found to be equal to 0.39 and 0.4,\nrespectively. The corresponding values for the excess path\nloss correlations were 0.51 and 0.49 for the respective links.\nAlthough neither correlation coefficient is high, the correlation\nbetween distance and rms delay spread is slightly lower than\nbetween excess path loss and delay spread.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nTime dispersion results of simultaneous measurements\nacross the 60-MHz FDD UMTS bands in a dense urban en-\nvironment have been presented. PDPs representative mainly of\ntemporal averages (72%) have been used in the analysis. The\ndata have been studied for frequency and bandwidth depen-\ndence, and the dependency of rms delay spread on path loss\nand distance has been compared with published models.\nSALOUS AND GOKALP: MEDIUM- AND LARGE-SCALE CHARACTERIZATION OF UMTS-ALLOCATED FDD CHANNELS 2843\nThe frequency and bandwidth dependence were found to\nbe related to shadowing. In the presence of a dominant line-\nof-sight component, the other multipath components and, in\nparticular, far away echoes make a smaller contribution to the\nresultant received signal; hence, time dispersion parameters\nare independent of frequency and bandwidth. In contrast, in\na shadowed location, a large number of relatively comparable\nstrength components are detected in addition to echoes from\ndistant high-rise buildings. As the frequency is varied, the\nrelative phase between these components in a particular time\ndelay bin varies with frequency, which gives rise to differences\nin the time dispersion parameters. Similarly, as the resolution\nbandwidth of analysis is varied, the total number of unresolved\nmultipath components in a particular time delay bin varies,\nwhich results in larger differences in delay spread parameters.\nPooling of the large-scale data using the commonly used cdf\nand histograms of the difference on a local area basis showed\nthat much greater differences can be detected between the FDD\nbands at certain locations than can be inferred from cdf.\nThe rms delay spread was found to fit a lognormal distri-\nbution, as proposed by Greenstein et al. [18], but when the\nmeasured data were fitted to the distance relationship proposed\nby Greenstein et al. [18], a discrepancy was found. Other\nrelationships proposed by Devasirvatham [19] and Feuerstein\n[21] between rms delay spread and path loss were also found to\nnot be suitable for the measurements in this paper.\nTo include the effects of both distance and excess path loss,\na regression fit between rms delay and excess path loss and\ndistance was derived from the measurements. The correlation\ncoefficients between rms delay spread and excess path loss\nwere found to be 0.5 for a path loss coefficient of about 2.5.\nThis value is smaller than the 0.75 correlation reported by\nGreenstein et al. [18] for a path loss coefficient of 3.58. The\ncorrelation coefficient between distance and time dispersion\nwas found to be 0.4.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the assistance of the re-\nsearch students V. Hinostroza, P.
