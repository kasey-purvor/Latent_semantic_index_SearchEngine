Around one fifth of \nworkers are engaged in some kind of shift work.\n1\n Technological advances, changes in \nthe economy, and the emergence of 24 hour societies\n2,3\n mean that shift work is no \nlonger confined to the manufacturing and industrial sectors, and it is now an important \naspect of employment in the retail and service sectors. Shift work continues to be \ncommonplace amongst health care and emergency services personnel, with up to 50% \nof hospital staff working on shifts.\n4\n However, it remains socially patterned with a \nhigher prevalence amongst lower socio-economic groups,\n5\n and so it is they who most \nexperience the adverse consequences of shift work on health and work-life balance \n(WLB).  \n \nPossible negative effects of shift work on health and WLB are well known.\n1,6-8\n \nReported health problems include sleep disturbances, fatigue, digestive problems, \nemotional problems and stress-related illnesses, as well as increases in general \nmorbidity, and in sickness absence.\n9\n These problems may derive from disruption to \nphysiological, psychological and social circadian rhythms.\n6,7\n  Shift work, particularly \nthat involving night work, disrupts the natural circadian rhythm as it requires people \nto be active at times when they would normally be sleeping and vice versa.\n7\n This  \nleads to sleep problems (as natural alerting mechanisms such as the cortisol surge and \ntemperature rise will interrupt sleep) as well as daytime functioning (wakefulness at \nnight will be reduced by temperature drops and melatonin surges). Sudden changes in \nschedule can therefore have an effect akin to \u201ejet lag\u201f. Disruption to the circadian \n  \n2 \n2 \nrhythm can also lead to disharmony within the body as some functions (e.g., heart \nrate) adapt more quickly than others (typically endogenous functions such as body \ntemperature, melatonin). This leads to desynchronisation which itself can result in \npsychological malaise, fatigue and gastro-intestinal problems. Realignment can take \nseveral weeks.\n7 \nPrevious studies have explored associations between the physiological \nand psychological aspects of long term exposure to shift work and health issues such \nas cardiovascular problems, pre-term births or breast cancer.\n10-12\n Shift work may also \ninvolve increased risk of injuries and accidents as performance fluctuates.\n13,14\n For \nexample, a review of injuries related to shift work concluded that workers on rotating \nshiftwork had a higher risk of injury than workers on fixed shifts, that there was a \ngreater risk of injury from shifts that rotated more frequently and that longer \nworkdays were no more hazardous than the more usual 8-hour workday.\n13\n \n \nMost existing research emphasises the physiological changes which shift work \ninduces, but shift work also involves significant social desynchronisation, involving \nworking at times and on days that may make it difficult to maintain a balanced \ndomestic and social life.\n15\n The Work Foundation defines work-life balance (WLB) as: \n\u201cpeople having a measure of control over when, where and how they work. It is \nachieved when an individual\u201fs right to a fulfilled life inside and outside paid work is \naccepted and respected as the norm to the mutual benefit of the individual, business \nand society\u201d.16 It has been suggested that work-life imbalance can lead to poorer \nhealth. For example, a study of the Swedish working population found that a majority \nof employees experienced work-life imbalance and that this was due to work \ninterfering with non-work activities. Self-reported health (GHQ) was significantly \nworse amongst employees who experienced work-life imbalance.\n17  \n  \n3 \n3 \n \nA range of interventions has been suggested to address the negative effects of shift \nwork.\n1\n These include interventions at the individual level: exposure to bright light or \nnapping; training, counselling and education; countermeasures against sleep \nproblems, problems with appetite and digestion; educational interventions (e.g., to \nhelp workers to cope with shift work); regular medical surveillance and \npharmaceutical interventions (e.g. melatonin administration); and selection strategies \nto remove the most vulnerable.\n7,18,19\n At the organisational level interventions include \ndecreased shift length (especially on night shift); redesign of shift work schedules \n(according to ergonomic criteria or to increase flexibility); improvements in working \nconditions (reducing noise or improving unfavourable working environments); and \nlegislation limiting working hours or exposure to shift work (e.g. the EU Working \nTime Directive, and its subsequent revisions).\n1\n \n \nThe effects of some of these interventions on health and WLB have been evaluated in \nprimary studies. This article presents the results of a systematic review of the health \nand WLB impacts of organisational level changes to shift work and any differential \nimpacts by social group. The review was conducted between October 2005 and \nNovember 2006. Although previous literature reviews exist in the area of shift work \nand health, these often concentrate on observational epidemiological (descriptive or \ncomparative) rather than evaluative intervention studies, tend to cover individual level \ninterventions only, focus on certain occupational groups, or have not been conducted \nusing full systematic review methodology.\n1,4,8,9,13, 20\n \n \n  \n4 \n4 \nMETHODS \nInclusion and Exclusion \nThe review sought to identify all primary empirical studies that examined the effects \nof organisational level interventions on the health and WLB of shift workers and their \nfamilies. We excluded studies of controlled exposure to darkness and light, as we \ndefined these as individual-level, rather than organizational-level interventions within \nthe context of this review. We also excluded selection strategies as these interventions \nseem to be primarily focussed on characteristics of the individual rather than on the \norganisation. For the purposes of the review, shift work was defined as \u201cany regularly \ntaken employment outside the hours of 0700 and 1800\u201d.7 Laboratory-based studies \nwere excluded. The range of health-related outcomes included incidence of specific \ndiseases (such as musculoskeletal disease) as well as measures of physical or \npsychological health and well-being (such as the General Health Questionnaire). \nSickness absence, health service usage, health behaviours and occupational injuries \nwere also included. Physiological measures, such as hormone excretion levels or body \ntemperature, were also included as were measures related to tiredness, fatigue and \nsleep.\n \nWLB was conceptualised in terms of the impacts of the interventions on social \nand domestic life (such as time spent with family). Organisational effects (for \nexample individual or organisational performance or job satisfaction) when reported \nalongside the primary outcomes (health and WLB), were also recorded. Differences in \noutcome by social group, age and gender were also noted.  \n \nSearch strategy \n27 electronic databases were searched from start date to November 2005 as well as \nbibliographies, reference lists, and websites for documents of any type, from any \n  \n5 \n5 \ncountry, at any time and in any language, including conference proceedings, \nunpublished manuscripts, theses and government-commissioned reports. Details of \nthe databases searched and an example search for MEDLINE are detailed in Boxes 1 \nand 2. The full search strategy is available in Web Appendix 1.  \n \nData Extraction and Quality Appraisal \n13287 titles were initially located, of which 398 were examined in more detail, and of \nthese 64 were retrieved for full paper analysis. The lead reviewer (CB) excluded \nobviously irrelevant titles and abstracts from the initial literature search, and retrieved \nfull text copies of the remainder. Studies making any reference to health or wellbeing \nwere independently appraised by two reviewers (CB and MP), who re-examined \npapers jointly to resolve disagreements.  \n \nQuality appraisal criteria were adapted from existing systematic reviews of the health \neffects of social interventions and, guidance for the evaluation of non-randomised \nstudies (Box 3).\n21-24\n Two reviewers (CB and MP) independently appraised the \nincluded studies according to these criteria.\n21-24\n  Amongst other things, the appraisal \nprocess included an examination of sampling strategy, as well as response and follow \nup rates, and adjustment for one or more of the following confounders: demographic, \nlifestyle, job content or shift work experience (Box 3). The quality appraisal criteria \nwere used for descriptive purposes only and to highlight variations in the quality of \nstudies (see \u201eDesign and Quality Appraisal\u201f column, tables 1-3), with the numbers 1-\n10 representing satisfactory fulfilment of the corresponding criterion. No quality \nscore was calculated and papers were not excluded on the basis of quality. \n \n  \n6 \n6 \nSynthesis \nData heterogeneity meant that meta-analysis of the results was not possible and so \nnarrative synthesis was performed with the results tabulated (Tables 1 \u2013 3) as well as \nsummarised in the following text.  \n \nRESULTS \nTwenty-six studies of organisational level interventions were synthesized. These \ncovered a diverse range of interventions: changes to the speed, direction and use of \nrotation, changes to night work, later start and finish times, changes to weekend \nworking, decreased shift lengths, and self-scheduling.\n25-51\n   One study was a crossover \ncontrolled trial,\n29\n and there were twenty prospective cohort studies,\n25-27,30-37,39,41,42,44-50\n \nof which twelve had a control  group.\n25,26,30,31,33,36,37,41,42,44-47\n The cohort study controls \nwere generally recruited from different sections of the same organisation (e.g. \ndifferent production lines within a factory or different wards within a hospital) \nalthough in two cases \n36,46\n a different organisation was used (which may have resulted \nin confounding due to, for example, different management practices). Similarly, only \nsix of the studies stated that they had adjusted for confounders: age, gender, shift \nwork experience, lifestyle factors, or job content.\n25,31,37,46,47,51\n The majority of studies \nwere conducted in fairly homogeneous populations (e.g. male production workers, or \nfemale nurses) and, perhaps in part due to this, only one study (a multiple intervention \nstudy of backward to forward rotation and slow to fast rotation)\n50\n differentiated \noutcomes by age, and none of the studies differentiated by socio-economic group or \ngender.  \n \n \n  \n7 \n7 \nSpeed of rotation \nThree small prospective studies examined the health related effects of changing the \nspeed of shift rotation (table 1).\n25-28\n All examined the effects of changing from slow to \nfast rotation (in each study, the switch to fast rotation consisted of a change from 6 or \n7 consecutive shifts of the same type e.g. 7 consecutive morning shifts, to a maximum \nof 3 or 4) and all reported positive health effects. In one German prospective cohort \nstudy with a control group of 50 chemical processing workers,\n25,26\n fatigue, sleep \ndisturbances, and appetite disturbances, improved in the intervention group. However, \nno differences between the control and intervention groups were found for gastro-\nintestinal problems, and some complaints (i.e. hot flushes, sweating) actually \nworsened.  In a small prospective cohort study of 39 traffic controllers in the \nNetherlands,\n27\n sleep complaints reduced slightly, although there were no changes in \nlevels of fatigue.  Similarly, in an Australian study of 26 emergency control room \noperators,\n28\n physical  and mental health indicators improved (sleep difficulties, \nabsence, headaches, digestive disorders, high blood pressure, diarrhoea, constipation, \nanxiety, and nervousness) but there were no statistically significant effects on health \nbehaviours (alcohol and cigarette consumption were unchanged).  \n \nA similar pattern emerged for the WLB outcomes with most studies of changes to the \nspeed of rotation reporting improvements or no change in WLB amongst the \nintervention groups. In the chemical processing study,\n25,26\n disturbance to social and \nfamily life improved when working the morning shifts, but there were no differences \nwhen on the afternoon or night shifts. In the study of traffic controllers,\n27\n domestic \nand child care problems, workload, and satisfaction with evening leisure time all \nimproved. However, complaints about leisure time remained unchanged and \n  \n8 \n8 \nsatisfaction with days off actually decreased. In the Australian study,\n28\n work pressure \nimproved, but the other indicators of WLB remained unchanged.  \n \nIt is not possible to comment with any confidence on the organisational effects of \nchanging from a slow to a fast rotating shift schedule as only one small study (n=26) \nstudy\n 28\n provided any information. This study reported an increase in levels of job \nsatisfaction after the intervention (increase from 36% to 50% of staff \u201csatisfied\u201d or \n\u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d). \n \nSeven of the studies of the effects of multiple interventions (table 3)\n44-47,49-51\n also \nexamined the effects of changing from a slow to a fast rotation. One of these studies \n(which also included a change from backward to forward rotation) compared \noutcomes by age. It found that sleep quality improved in older workers compared to \nyounger workers.\n50 \nHowever, these changes occurred alongside other concurrent \ninterventions making it difficult to identify the effects of any single intervention.  \n \nDirection of rotation \nTwo studies of single interventions examined the effects of changes in the direction of \nrotation (table 1).\n29,30\n  \n \nOne study,\n29\n a crossover controlled trial of 45 Swedish police officers, examined the \neffects of changing from backward (night, afternoon, morning) to forward (morning, \nafternoon, night) rotation. It found that some coronary risk factors (levels of \ntriglyceride and serum glucose), mean systolic blood pressure, and mean sleep quality \nand duration during the day shift, all improved during the intervention period whereas \n  \n9 \n9 \ncholesterol and serum uric acid levels, diastolic blood pressure, sleep quality and \nduration on the night shift, and tobacco consumption were unchanged during the \nintervention phase, and self-rated health actually worsened.  However, for the latter \noutcome there were very short periods of follow up of only three and five weeks.  \n \nAnother study, a prospective cohort study with a control group of 263 male car \nproduction workers,\n30\n examined the effects of changing rotation in the opposite \ndirection - from forward to backward rotation. It reported a mix of health effects with \nhealth related behaviour indicators, cigarette and alcohol consumption improving in \nthe intervention group compared to the control group, whilst general health measures \n(sleep quality on morning and night shifts, GHQ 12, chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal \nsymptoms, sleep difficulties, duration and onset times) were no different in the \nintervention group, and sleep quality on afternoon shift days actually worsened.  \n \nIn both studies, WLB (except satisfaction with the amount of leisure time\n29\n or social \ndisruption\n30\n) was unchanged by the interventions. Job dissatisfaction, the only \norganisational indicator measured, was also unaffected.\n30\n  \n \nRemoval of shift work rotation \nTwo prospective cohort studies of police officers in the USA, one with a control \ngroup\n31 \nand one without,\n32\n examined the removal of shift work rotation (the change \nfrom a rotating shift system in which all the different types of shift e.g. morning, \nafternoon, night are worked, to a permanent shift system in which only one type of \nshift is worked e.g. afternoon) as a single intervention (table 1). One other study\n33\n \nexamined the removal of rotation alongside changes to the speed of rotation (table 3). \n  \n10 \n10 \n \nThe single methodologically-sound intervention study with a control group examined \n239 police officers\n31\n and reported an improvement in sleep but all other self-reported \nhealth indicators (trouble digesting, on the job tiredness, appetite problems, general \nhealth, amount of smoking and drinking, and headaches) were unchanged. In the other \nstudy of 63 police officers,\n32\n all of the health indicators improved significantly after \nthe intervention: sleep quality and duration improved (e.g. sleep required decreased \nslightly from 8.11 hours to 7.77 hours and sleep adequacy and quality of sleep \nimproved); psychological symptoms decreased and mean severity of symptoms \nreduced slightly; and the amount of sickness absence decreased (from a total of 1400 \nhours in the six months before the intervention to 883 hours in the six months after the \nintervention).  \n \nIn terms of WLB and organisational outcomes, the study with a control group\n31\n \nprovided equivocal findings as whilst spousal satisfaction improved in the \nintervention group compared to the control group, a number of other WLB indicators \nwere unaffected (table 1). Similarly, whilst productivity increased (number of arrests \nand tickets issued increased by 6% in the intervention group), there was no difference \nin reported job satisfaction.  \n \nChanges to night work \nThree studies each examined slightly different changes to the nature of night work \n(table 2).\n33-35 \n \n \n  \n11 \n11 \nOne study, a sizeable (n=305), prospective cohort with a control group and 12 months \nfollow-up,\n33\n examined the removal of night shifts in a Swedish steel factory. This \nstudy found that sleep and gastrointestinal complaints improved although there were \nno changes in shift specific health problems, sleep length or sickness absence. WLB, \nmeasured in terms of the number of complaints made about social life (e.g. mean \namount of time available to spend on clubs and hobbies, going out, political activity, \netc.), also improved in the intervention group compared to the control group. No \norganisational outcomes were measured.  \n \nIn a prospective cohort of 76 UK police officers,\n34\n a reduction in the number of \nconsecutive night shifts on the Ottawa system (the Ottawa system consists of three or \nfour 10 hour morning or afternoon shifts spread over four days then two days off. This \nis followed by a block of seven 8 hour nights then six days off) was examined. It \nreported that night shift fatigue and sleepiness worsened. Caffeine intake was \nunchanged. However, the small sample and short length of follow-up limited the \ngeneralisability of the findings. \n \nAnother much smaller (n=18) but well-conducted prospective cohort study, this time \namong Japanese nurses,\n35\n examined the effects of increasing the rest period before the \nrotation onto night shift. This study suggested that although the intervention enabled \nan increase in sleep before the night shift, there was no change in irritation or \ntiredness once the night shift began.  \n \n \n \n  \n12 \n12 \nLater start and finish times  \nOne larger study (table 2) examined the introduction of later start and finish times to \nthe shifts of 208 workers in a Finnish steel mill.\n36\n Changes in the rates of health \ncomplaints and chronic fatigue were no different in the intervention group compared \nto the control group although the sleep indicators were more mixed with \nimprovements only in sleep duration on the evening shifts, satisfaction with amount of \nsleep for those on the morning shifts, and awakening refreshed from sleep for those on \nthe morning shifts). WLB outcomes worsened as interference of shift work with \ndomestic activities increased, although workload was unchanged in the intervention \ngroup. Similarly, there were no differences between the intervention and control \ngroups in terms of job satisfaction. The quality appraisal suggested that some \nobserved changes may actually be due to differences between the control and \nintervention groups at baseline, and the length of follow-up is short (4 months).  \n \nOne of the studies of multiple interventions (table 3)\n49\n examined the introduction of \nlater start and finish times. However this occurred alongside changes to both the speed \nand direction of rotation so it is not possible to isolate the specific effects of later start \nand finish times.  \n \nChanges to weekend working \nOne methodologically-sound (n=101) prospective controlled study examined the \nswitch from continuous (weekends on) to discontinuous (weekends off) shift work \n(table 2).\n37\n The change was introduced to make the shift schedule more \nergonomically-acceptable for the 101 nurses in a Danish hospital. HDL cholesterol \n  \n13 \n13 \nworsened in the intervention group but total and LDL cholesterol improved. No other \noutcomes more directly relevant to health were reported. \n \nA multiple-intervention study,\n33\n in which a concurrent change to the speed of rotation \noccurred, also examined this type of intervention. It was not possible to isolate any \nunique effect of the change to discontinuous working, and furthermore, the quality \nappraisal process suggested that the intervention and control groups may not be \ncomparable.    \n \nOne small, well-conducted, retrospective study dating back to 1956\n38\n examined the \neffects of the extension of shift working to cover weekends (a change from \ndiscontinuous to continuous shift work). The study, of 73 wives of UK steel workers, \nreported only on WLB outcomes (social life, domestic routine, time with husband) \nwhich were unaffected by the move to weekend working.\n38\n A small (n=52) \nprospective multiple-intervention study\n46\n also examined this intervention, although it \noccurred alongside a change from slow to fast rotation and so its positive findings on \nsleep cannot be solely attributed to the change to continuous working. Conversely, \nthough, it was possible for the authors to link a decrease in workers\u201f income to the \nintroduction of continuous working on the basis that weekend overtime payments \nceased.  There were some methodological problems with this study (see table 3). \n \nDecreased shift lengths \nTwo studies\n39,40 \nwere identified in which the health and WLB effects of decreasing the \nlength of shifts were examined.  A small prospective cohort study (uncontrolled) of 35 \nAmerican paramedics\n39\n examined a reduction in average on-call shift length from 24 \n  \n14 \n14 \nhours to 12 hours. It found that emotional exhaustion improved significantly two \nmonths after the reduction (but this was not maintained at the 12 month follow-up) as \ndid the impact of work schedule on social and family life. However, no effects were \nfound for depersonalisation or job satisfaction.  \n \nIn a retrospective study from 1933 of 265 female factory workers in the USA,\n40\n the \nchange from 8hr to 6hr shifts had little effect on fatigue levels (56.1% reported no \ndifference in fatigue levels before and after the intervention) or on domestic life. \nHowever, the decreased working hours resulted in wage reductions for the majority of \nemployees. The quality appraisal process raised a number of questions about the \nquality of the study (table 2) and the generalisability of such an old study is also \nquestionable. \n \nSelf-scheduling \nSelf-scheduling enables individual shift workers to have some control over which \nshifts they work, their start times, or when their rest days occur. Three prospective \nstudies examined the introduction of self-scheduling.\n41-43\n In all three of the studies, \nthe intervention was introduced to improve working conditions. The two prospective \ncohorts with control groups examined bus drivers,\n41,42\n whilst a repeat cross sectional \nstudy focused on 45 nursing staff at a UK hospital.\n43\n Health and WLB outcomes were \nalmost universally improved in all three: with decreases in absence, fatigue, and \ncomplaints about family life recorded in the study of 50 bus drivers in the \nNetherlands,\n41\n accidents decreased by 20% and opportunities to plan leisure time, and \nsocial contacts improved in the study of 24 German bus drivers,\n42\n whilst the ability to \nmaintain a WLB was also improved in the hospital based study.\n43\n Only complaints \n  \n15 \n15 \nabout free time and time spent with the children in the Netherlands study were \nunimproved by the intervention.\n41\n Similarly, in the two studies which measured \norganisational outcomes,\n41,42\n there were improvements in the number of productive \nwork hours (from 50% to 54% of hours)\n41\n and the number of customer complaints \n(decreased by 52%).\n42 \n \n \nTwo of the studies of multiple interventions (table 3)\n47-49\n also incorporated aspects of \nself-scheduling. However, self-scheduling was one of three or four different \nconcurrent changes in both studies so they cannot be used as evidence of the \nindependent effects of self-scheduling interventions.   \n \nDISCUSSION \nEffects of the interventions  \nOverall, most types of organisational shift work intervention examined in this \nsystematic review appear to have either positive or neutral effects on health and WLB \n(see Box 4). No one type of organisational intervention was found to be consistently \nharmful to workers (although this may be due to publication bias or methodological \nproblems - see below). Three types of intervention though were reported to have \nbeneficial effects: switching from slow to fast rotation, changing from backward to \nforward rotation, and self-scheduling of shifts.  \n \nSwitching from slow to fast shift rotation  \nThe studies of interventions which redesigned shift work schedules so that they used \nfast rather than slow rotation reported consistently positive effects on the health \nrelated outcomes of sleep and fatigue.\n25-28\n This is in keeping with the broader \n  \n16 \n16 \nepidemiological and laboratory-based research literature, in which fast rotations have \nbeen shown to be more closely matched to the natural circadian rhythm and therefore \npotentially less damaging to health.\n52-54\n Although somewhat less conclusive, the \nevidence suggested that WLB (in terms of disruption to domestic routines) also \ngenerally improved with the introduction of fast rotating schedules.\n25-28\n \nOrganisational effects were positive in terms of job satisfaction, but this was only \nconsidered in one study.\n28\n \n \nChanging from backward to forward shift rotation \nEpidemiological and laboratory studies have also suggested that changing the \ndirection of shift schedules from backward to forward rotation is more in keeping with \nthe body\u201fs circadian rhythm, and that therefore positive health effects could ensue, \nespecially in terms of sleep.\n7,14,48,54\n  Only one single intervention study, a crossover \ntrial, was located which examined the change from backward to forward rotation, and \nit confirmed this view.\n29\n Backward to forward rotation had no notable impact on \nWLB and no organisational factors were measured.    \n \nSelf-scheduling of shifts \nHealth, WLB, and organisational effectiveness were positively enhanced in all three \nof the studies which examined the introduction of self-scheduling amongst shift \nworkers.\n41-43\n Self-scheduling necessarily entails increasing employee control at work, \nsomething which has been strongly associated in the epidemiological literature, most \nnotably by the Whitehall Studies,\n55-57\n and other reviews of work reorganisation \ninterventions,\n21,22,58\n with improved health and well-being. In line with such research, \nthe intervention studies included in this review suggest that, even amongst specific \n  \n17 \n17 \noccupational groups such as shift workers, increasing control can have beneficial \nhealth, social, and organisational effects.  \n \nQuality appraisal \nAlthough the twenty-six intervention studies reviewed represent the available \nevidence base on the health and well-being effects of changing the organisation of \nshift work, the quality appraisal process revealed a number of limitations.  \n \nThe evidence base was small and only one trial was found.\n29\n Furthermore, whilst the \ninterventions were often evaluated using a prospective controlled study \ndesigns,\n25,26,30,31,33,36,37,41,42,44-47\n these were usually not matched or randomised and in \nat least one case there were significant group differences at \nbaseline.\n25,26,30,32,33,36,37,41,42,44-46 \nIn addition, a sizeable number of studies reported \nconcurrent (multiple) interventions.\n33,44-51\n  \n \nAs noted earlier, this was the first systematic review of the effects of changing the \norganisation of shift work so we elected to include all studies regardless of sample \nsize (or quality). However, a number of studies had such small final sample sizes (e.g. \neleven studies had final sample sizes of 50 or fewer\n25-29,35,39,41,42,43,49,50\n) that their value \nin informing policy may in some cases be limited. This raises the possibility that any \npositive findings may be due to publication bias, in which small studies with positive \nfindings are more likely to be published than those with negative findings. Similarly, \npublication bias may have arisen as only studies in the public domain were locatable \nthus excluding the majority of commercial studies.  \n \n  \n18 \n18 \nThe outcomes were usually self-reported and they varied greatly from study to study. \nSimilarly, there was a dearth of well validated questionnaires, such as the General \nHealth Questionnaire.\n30\n The study follow ups were generally 12 months or less\n27-51\n \nand so it was not possible to analyse the longer term effects on health or WLB of the \ninterventions. Furthermore, it was unclear what the effects of changing the \norganisation of shift work are on health inequalities as no studies examined this \noutcome. \n \nConclusions \nThe results of this systematic review of intervention studies supports the results of \ndescriptive epidemiological research and laboratory-based studies which have \nsuggested that slow to fast rotation and backward to forward rotation are less harmful \nto the health and WLB of shift workers.\n1,7,14,48,52-54\n Furthermore, the review reinforces \nprevious research showing that increased control at work, in this case via self-\nscheduling, can be beneficial to the health and WLB of workers.\n22,23,55-58\n There are \nhowever some reservations about the extent and quality of the evidence base, which \nfuture prospective, well controlled, intervention studies should address.  \n  \n19 \n19 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe work in this paper was undertaken by researchers at the Wolfson Research \nInstitute (Durham University), the MRC Public and Social Health Sciences Unit \n(Glasgow), the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (University of York), and the \nDepartment of Public Health (University of Liverpool) as part of the work of the \nPublic Health Research Consortium (PHRC).

However, the well-being effects were less \nclear. \n \nRemoval of rotation (2 studies)\n31,32\n  \nThe evidence base is small and somewhat inconclusive with few negative or positive \neffects on health, well-being or economic outcomes. \n \nChanges to night work (3 studies)\n33-35\n \nThe current evidence base on the health effects of changes to night working is diverse \nand quite weak - three uncontrolled studies of three slightly different interventions \nconducted in three different settings \u2013 and so it is not possible to offer any real \nconclusions about the effects on health and well-being.  \n \nLater start and finish times (1 study)\n36 \n \nThere is a very small evidence base of one study, reporting inconclusive effects on health-\nrelated outcomes, and a worsening of work\/life balance. \n \nChanges to weekend working (2 studies)\n37,38\n  \nVery little evidence was located on the health, well-being or economic effects of changes \nto weekend shift work.  \n \nDecreased hours (2 studies)\n39,40\n \nOnly a partial and diverse evidence base was found, from which it is not possible to draw \nany firm conclusions about the health and well-being effects of reducing shift length.   \n \nSelf-scheduling (3 studies)\n41-43\n  \nAll studies found that self-scheduling improved health and well-being. However, given the \nsmall size of the studies, the focus on only two different occupational settings, and the \nlack of control group in any of the studies, more robust research is needed to add weight \nto and reinforce this conclusion.  \n \n  \n44 \n44 \nWeb Appendix 1: Full search strategy \n \nMEDLINE (1966-2005 Nov week 2) (OVID) \nSearched 21\/11\/05. \n3249 records retrieved \n \n64. shiftwork$.ti,ab.  \n65. nightwork$.ti,ab.  \n66.
