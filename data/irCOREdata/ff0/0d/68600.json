INTRODUCTION\nQuantum pumps transfer electrons between two reser-\nvoirs by externally varying their scattering properties\nover time. This concept has attracted much attention\nsince its inception, due in part to its promise for practical\napplications in nanoelectronics1,2 and for the definition\nof a current standard,3\u20135 but also because of its elegant\ntheoretical description in terms of the geometry of the\ncontrol parameter manifold.6\u20139\nEfficient quantum pumping requires strong but energy-\ndependent coupling of the pump to the reservoirs. In nor-\nmal systems, pumping is therefore constrained to propa-\ngating modes, while the poorly coupled evanescent modes\ndecay rapidly away from the contacts and therefore can-\nnot contribute to the pumped charge. Here, we show that\nthe discovery of graphene-based materials10 calls for a re-\nvision of such common concepts in quantum pumping. In\ngraphene, the low-energy charge carriers are described by\na massless Dirac equation,11 and the unique feature of\nchirality suppresses backscattering at interfaces, result-\ning in the so-called Klein paradox by which charge carri-\ners are difficult to confine.12\u201314 This seems to inhibit the\nprospects of quantum pumping\u2014unless one properly ac-\ncounts for the effects of chirality on the evanescent modes.\nThese effects so far have been explored only for station-\nary ballistic transport, where evanescent chiral electrons\nmanifest themselves in macroscopic quantum tunneling\nclose to the Dirac point of charge-neutral graphene.15,16\nWe show that the scattering of these evanescent modes is\nsufficiently energy-dependent so that they contribute sig-\nnificantly to quantum pumping. Close to the Dirac point,\nthey deliver the dominant contribution to the pumped\ncharge, which can be characterized by a universal dimen-\nsionless pumping efficiency.\nWe start this paper in Sec. II with a description of the\nemployed model (a quantum pump driven by two electro-\nstatic gates) and method (the scattering approach to adi-\nabatic quantum pumping). Our results are presented in\nSec. III. The concluding remarks in Sec. IV also contain\na discussion of practical advantages of graphene-based\nquantum pumps.\nU1AU\nU2\nC1 C2\nV1 V2\nV0\nU\n(x\n)\nL\nU (t)2\nU (t)1\nUndoped leads\nx\nx\nU (t)2\nU (t)1U\n(x\n)\nHighly doped leads\nL\nW\nx\ny\nL\nFIG. 1. (Color online) Left panels: Illustration of a graphene\nquantum pump with highly doped (metallic) contacts. Two\ngates at voltage V1(t) and V2(t) control the time-dependent\nonsite energy U1(t) and U2(t) in the graphene flake over a\npumping cycle. This induces a charge transport between two\ncontact electrodes, separated by a distance L. The work-\ning point of the device can be further controlled by an ad-\nditional back gate with voltage V0. Right panels: Snapshots\nof the onsite potential along the quantum pump, for highly\ndoped (metallic) contacts (top) and undoped contacts (bot-\ntom). The solid base line shows the potential at the working\npoint. We show that evanescent modes induced by metallic\ncontacts enable finite charge pumping at vanishing nominal\ncharge-carrier density, in striking contrast to the case of nor-\nmal pumps where the nanoribbon is replaced by a normal\nconductor.\nII. MODEL AND METHOD\nIn order to characterize the unique features of quan-\ntum pumping in graphene, we compare the behavior of\nfour different setups: graphene pumps with either heavily\ndoped contacts or undoped contacts are contrasted with\nnormal-conductor pumps with these two types of con-\ntacts. In the absence of driving (i.e., at the working point\nof the pump), the systems with undoped contacts have\na uniform carrier density, equal in both the leads and\nin the central pumping region. In contrast, the charge\ncarrier density in heavily doped contacts is very large;\nthis can be realized by metallic contacts17. We assume\nthat the charge carrier density in the system can be fur-\nther uniformly shifted by a back gate covering both the\npumping region and leads, thereby tuning the working\nar\nX\niv\n:0\n90\n7.\n15\n68\nv2\n  [\nco\nnd\n-m\nat.\nme\ns-h\nall\n]  \n15\n D\nec\n 20\n09\n2point of the device. For heavily doped contacts, the back-\ngate-induced change of the charge carrier density in the\nleads can be neglected. Since only the setup with highly\ndoped contacts induces evanescent modes, this compari-\nson allows to isolate the requirements for the successful\ndeployment of such modes in quantum pumping.\nIn all of these four cases, we consider a standard pump-\ning mechanism, which is shown for the example of a\ngraphene pump with heavily doped (metallic) contacts\nin the left panels of Fig. 1. The pump is operated by\na cyclic raising and lowering of the potential in two ad-\nditional electrostatic gates, which modulate the charge\ncarrier density in the two halves of the system due to\ntheir effect on the onsite potential U . This induces charge\ntransfer between the two electronic reservoirs of the con-\ntacts. The bottom left panel shows a rotated view of the\npump, which is further characterized by the width W\nand length L of the pumping region. The top right panel\nshows a snapshot of the onsite potential (dashed line) for\nthe case of highly n-doped contacts (the solid line is the\nonsite potential at the working point). The bottom right\npanel shows a corresponding snapshot for undoped leads.\nAn elegant formulation of quantum pumping is af-\nforded by the scattering approach7,8, which considers the\ntime dependence of the scattering matrix S(t). In the\nminimal case of adiabatic driving with two independent\nparameters \u03be = {\u03be1, \u03be2} and single channel reservoirs,\nthe charge transferred across the non-interacting scatter-\ning region reduces to an integral over the area enclosed\nby the driving path in two-dimensional (2D) parameter\nspace18,\nQ =\n\u222b\nd\u03be1d\u03be2 \u2202\n2\n\u03beQ(\u03be), (1a)\n\u22022\u03beQ \u2261\n1\n2pi\n(\n\u2202T\n\u2202\u03be1\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03be2\n\u2212 \u2202T\n\u2202\u03be2\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03be1\n)\n.

This is\nthe case for the quantum pump setup depicted in Fig. 1.\nAcross the width W of the system, the onsite potential\nU is y independent, so that different scattering channels\nq remain decoupled. We model this profile by two abrupt\npotential steps in the x direction of equal length L\/2 and\nassume the two driving parameters \u03be = {U1(t), U2(t)}\nhave zero average, and maximum amplitudes \u03b4U1 and\n\u03b4U2, respectively. A back gate is used to control the\ncarrier concentration in both pump and leads, which\nwe parameterize by the average Fermi momentum kF in\nthe pumping region. Undoped contacts have the same\nFermi momentum kF as the pumping region, while heav-\nily doped contacts have a much larger Fermi momentum,\nwhich can effectively be taken as infinite.19 By employing\nthe Dirac equation with negligible inter-valley scattering\nfor graphene12, and an effective mass approximation for\nthe normal system, this model allows us to compute the\ntransmission probabilities and phases Tq and \u03c6q by sim-\nple wave matching.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe finite length L of the pump provides a natural\nscale for the scattering problem. It fixes the energy scales\nEGL = ~v0\/L (with Dirac velocity v0) in the graphene\ncase, and ENL = ~2\/(2m\u2217L2) (with effective mass m\u2217)\nfor the normal conductor, which are related to the level\nspacing of the isolated pump. These energies determine\ntwo possible driving regimes, depending on the maximum\namplitude \u03b4ui of the dimensionless driving energies ui \u2261\nUi\/EL. In the weak driving regime, \u03b4ui \u001c 1, the charge\npumped in channel q can be approximated by\nQq \u2248 \u22022uQq(0)\n\u222b\ndu1du2 = Au\u22022uQq(0), (2)\nwhere Au \u223c \u03b4u1\u03b4u2 is the small area enclosed in parame-\nter space by the driving cycle, wherein \u22022uQq(u1, u2) can\nbe approximated by a constant. Away from this regime\nthe integral in Eq. (1) has to be performed numerically.\nFor the graphene pump with heavily doped contacts,\nEq.

Momentum kx is real for\npropagating modes |q| < kF and imaginary for modes\n|q| > kF that are evanescent in the pump. In contrast,\na graphene pump with undoped leads has no incoming\nlead modes that become evanescent in the pump (in the\nlimit \u03b4ui \u001c 1), since the Fermi momentum in the pump\nat the working point is identical to the Fermi momentum\nin the contacts.

Blue and brown represent opposite directions of pump-\ning (left to right or right to left). In graphene, the propagating\nmode with q = 0 (normal incidence) cannot be pumped due\nto the Klein paradox. In the case of graphene with heavily\ndoped leads, however, significant pumping is possible due to\nthe contribution of the evanescent modes (|q| > kF , delineated\nby the dashed line), which dominate around the Dirac point\n(kF = 0). The other pumps can only drive current through\nthe propagating modes.\nnumber Np = 4kFW\/pi of propagating electrons at the\nFermi energy and the dimensionless driving strength Au.\nBy factoring out these two quantities, we obtain the di-\nmensionless pumping response\n\u03c7uq \u2261\n\u22022uQq\nNp\n\u2248 Qq\nAuNp\n, (5)\nwhich depends only on the system\u2019s scattering charac-\nteristics at a given energy.

(6)\nThis defines the total dimensionless pumping response\nper mode. For short and wide pumps (W \u001d L), the sum\nover modes can be approximated by an integral.\nSimilar results can be derived for the normal pump,\nQnq = Au8\nk2FK\n3\nx\nkxL2\nsin2(kxL) (7)\n\u00d7 2kxL(k\n2\nx \u2212K2x) cos(2kxL) + (k2x +K2x) sin(2kxL)[\n4k2xK2x cos2(2kxL) + (k2x +K2x)2 sin\n2(2kxL)\n]2\nBoth the heavily doped contact (Qn\u2212\u221eq ) and undoped\ncontact (Qn\u22120q ) normal cases can be derived from the\nabove by taking the x momentum in the leads Kx to\ninfinity or kx respectively.\nIn Fig. 2 we represent the pumping response \u03c7uq of\nEq. (5) as a function of q and kF in the two graphene\nsetups, and compare these with the results of the normal\npumps. For graphene we only show results for electron\ncarriers. If the leads are heavily doped the pumped cur-\nrent reverts sign when the carriers in the central pump\nregion are changed from electrons to holes [cf. Eq. (3)].\nIn the case of undoped leads, the pumped current re-\nmains the same and only reverts sign if one also reverts\nthe pumping cycle.\nIn all four panels, the dashed line delineates the thresh-\nold between evanescent and propagating modes. The\nmost evident feature in the graphene pump with heav-\nily doped leads [Fig. 2(a)] is the contribution of evanes-\ncent modes to pumping close to the Dirac point. This\ncontribution is absent in the other three cases, in which\nonly propagating electrons are pumped. The reason for\nthis is the high transmission of evanescent modes in\ngraphene, which can be attributed to chirality and the\nKlein paradox13. Unlike in the normal pump with heavily\ndoped leads, chirality conservation at the contact enables\nevanescent electrons to populate the graphene pumping\nregion for modes within a window of width \u2206q \u223c 1\/L\naround q = 0. These evanescent modes contribute to\npumping because they are sensitive to the onsite poten-\ntials Ui and have a finite amplitude at both contacts,\nso that charge transfer between them is possible over a\npumping cycle. The finite contribution of the evanescent\nmodes in graphene is in striking contrast to the vanishing\ncontribution of electrons in the propagating mode q = 0\n(normal incidence), for which the transmission Tq=0 = 1\nis perfect at all energies because of the Klein paradox\u2014\nthese modes are therefore insensitive to driving and can-\nnot be pumped.\nIn a normal pump with heavily doped contacts [Fig.\n2(b)], the large Fermi velocity mismatch suppresses the\ntransparency of the contacts for all modes except those\nat resonant tunneling. This confinement creates sharply\ndefined energy levels in the pump which are the origin of\nnarrow regions of finite pumping, and results in a thresh-\nold kFL ' 1 below which no pumping occurs. In par-\nticular, the contribution of evanescent modes to pump-\ning is strongly suppressed (no contribution outside of the\ndashed line). Moreover, normal pumping in the limit of\nlarge lead doping is directed, meaning that for a given\norientation of the driving cycle, the pumped current has\nthe same sign for all energies.\nFor graphene and normal pumps with undoped leads\n[Fig. 2(c) and (d)], all incoming modes remain propagat-\ning in the pumping region. The main difference between\ngraphene and normal pumps in this limit is the effect of\nthe Klein paradox in the former, which suppresses pump-\ning at q = 0, just as in the case of graphene with doped\nleads. Both pumps are open, and consequently there is no\nenergy threshold for pumping. The sign of the pumped\ncurrent is energy dependent, which is a generic feature\nof open pumps (including graphene pump with doped\nleads).\n4k LF00\nu\uffff\n2 4 6 8 10\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n0\n0.05\nUndoped leadsHighly doped leads\n0.0288\n0 0.1 0\n0.05\n0 0.1\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nGraphene pump Normal-conducting pump\nUndoped leadsHighly doped leads\nFIG. 3.

(6) for the four types of pumps\nconsidered (left panel: graphene pumps; right panel:\nnormal-conducting pumps). The regime of evanescent\nelectron pumping in graphene with highly doped leads\nis visible as a saturation at kF = 0 (see the solid curve\nin the inset).

In contrast, all other pumps\nhave a vanishing pumping response at depletion. At ener-\ngies kF & 1\/L, the pumping response rises to 1\/2 and 1\/4\nin the cases of undoped and highly doped leads, respec-\ntively. The normal pump with highly doped leads, how-\never, only operates above a finite carrier-concentration\nthreshold corresponding to the position of the first reso-\nnant tunneling subband as mentioned above.\nIV. CONCLUDING REMARKS\nIn summary, we find that evanescent modes can con-\ntribute significantly to graphene-based quantum pump-\ning, to the extent that they provide the dominant contri-\nbution to the pumped charge when the system is operated\nclose to the charge-neutrality point. Our comparison to\nresults for normal pumps reveals that this effect is inti-\nmately related to chirality and the Klein paradox, and\ntherefore arises from the unique low-energy properties of\ncharge carriers in graphene. For the case of short and\nwide pumps, the evanescent pumping regime is charac-\nterized by a sample-independent universal value of the\ndimensionless pumping response.\nPractical considerations point towards additional ad-\nvantages of graphene-based quantum pumps. Firstly, in\na realistic experimental setup, the principal pump driv-\ning parameters are not the onsite energies Ui, but gate\nvoltages Vi (see Fig. 1) which manipulate the locally\ninduced charge density ni(t) = Vi(t)Ci under each gate\ndepending on the capacitances Ci. The onsite energies\nthen follow from the difference of the Fermi energy and\nthe local position of the Dirac point. Neglecting details\nof the screening, for graphene ni = Wu2i \/(piL), whilst for\nthe normal case ni = Wui\/(2piL) (in the case of graphene\nwith highly doped leads, a precise modeling would also\nhave to take care of charge carriers populating the evanes-\ncent modes). In terms of these charge densities, the rel-\nevant response function is\n\u03c7n = \u03c7u det\n(\n\u2202ui\n\u2202nj\n)\n, (9)\ninvolving the Jacobian between the u and the n vari-\nables. Due to the divergence \u2202ui\/\u2202ni \u221d n\u22121\/2i close to\nthe Dirac point, the experimental pumping response \u03c7n\nfor graphene pumps is expected to rapidly increase as one\napproaches charge neutrality, while it vanishes for normal\npumps. Secondly, graphene-based quantum pumping\npromises to display an enhanced robustness against ther-\nmal effects. Thermal smearing of the pumping response20\noccurs at temperatures of order EL\/kB , which are con-\nsiderably higher in graphene than in normal pumps (this\nis also one of the reasons for the temperature robustness\nof other transport effects in graphene21). For the same\nreason, mechanisms limiting the pumping frequency are\nexpected to be less stringent in graphene than in normal\npumps. These considerations, together with the long co-\nherence length and high mobility in graphene, lead us to\nbelieve that graphene-based quantum pumps have good\nchances to become an experimental reality.\nWe acknowledge support from the European Com-\nmission, Marie Curie Excellence Grant MEXT-CT-2005-\n023778.\n1 M.
