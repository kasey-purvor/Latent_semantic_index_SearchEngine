INTRODUCTION\nThe transport of energy or heat has been intensively\nstudied since Fourier introduced his famous law of heat\nconduction in 1807. Surprisingly, still 200 years later,\nsome fundamental problems remain unsolved1. Contrary\nto our everyday experience, the appearance of diffusive\nbehavior according to Fourier\u2019s famous law is difficult to\nobtain from the direction of any underlying microscopic\ntheory.\nA question of central relevance concerns the classifi-\ncation of the transport properties of a system into nor-\nmal diffusive or ballistic behavior. In the classical do-\nmain, it seems to be largely accepted that normal en-\nergy transport, i.e., spatial diffusion instead of ballistic\ntransport or localization, requires the chaotic dynamics\nof a nonintegrable system2,3. In the quantum regime,\nhowever, the question whether diffusive behavior follows\nfrom the underlying theory turns out to be a controver-\nsial issue4,5,6,7,8. This is mostly due to the nontrivial\ncharacter of the question, how energy is transported on\nthe microscopic scale.\nAmongst the many different techniques of investigating\ntransport in quantum mechanics, let us consider two ap-\nproaches in more detail here. The first one is the promi-\nnent Green-Kubo formula. Derived on the basis of linear\nresponse theory it has originally been formulated for elec-\ntrical transport9,10,11. Therein, the system is perturbed\nby an external force, first the electric field, applied to\nthe system. The resulting current of charge is viewed\nas the response to this external perturbation. Finally,\nthe transport coefficient (conductivity) follows from a\ncurrent-current autocorrelation. The same approach is\nalso used in the different case of density driven transport,\ne.g., the transport of energy or heat. In such a situation,\nthe current is driven by a much more complicated mecha-\nnism (the coupling of reservoirs to the system) than sim-\nply an external force, which can be nicely written as a\nterm within the Hamiltonian of the system. Neverthe-\nless, the correlation function is ad hoc transferred to the\ndensity driven scenario by replacing the electrical current\nby the energy or heat current12. However, the justifica-\ntion of this replacement remains a conceptual problem\nhere.\nOne big advantage of this widely used approach is cer-\ntainly its computability after having diagonalized the sys-\ntem\u2019s Hamiltonian. A nice overview of results from the\nKubo formula for spin models can be found, e.g., in the\nwork by Heidrich-Meisner13 (for further reading we sug-\ngest the comprehensive literature cited therein). How-\never, in most cases, a direct analytical solution for an in-\nfinite system is not feasible and the interpretation of the\nresults for finite systems seems to be not straight forward.\nFor a finite system, the frequency dependent transport\ncoefficient consists of numerous delta peaks with differ-\nent weights at frequencies \u03c9 and is zero elsewhere. How\nto extract the dc-conductivity (interesting especially for\nthe energy transport) of the finite system from this result\nor extrapolate the conductivity for the infinite one is a\ndifficult question14,15,16,17.\nA different approach to investigate the transport be-\nhavior of a system is more connected to the experimen-\ntal measurement of heat conductivities: The system is\ndirectly coupled to heat baths of different temperatures\nwithin the theory of open quantum systems18,19,20,21,22.\nThat means that the Liouville von Neumann equation,\ndescribing the time evolution of the density operator of\nthe system, is extended by incoherent damping terms\nsimulating the influence of the heat baths. How to set up\nthe correct dynamical equation here is highly nontrivial\nand involves the combination of many subtle approxi-\nmation schemes. In the case of an improper approach,\nthe derivation can lead to mathematically correct, but\nphysically irrelevant dynamical equations as discussed\nrecently23. Having derived a proper quantum master\nequation (QME), the interpretation of the results for fi-\nnite systems is relatively easy: After finding the station-\nary state of the dissipative dynamics, all interesting quan-\n2tities as currents and energy profiles are simply accessible\nby computing the expectation value of the respective op-\nerator. However, also this approach is restricted to finite\nsystems since a complete analytical solution for larger\nsystems is not available. Thus, the extrapolation to infi-\nnite systems needs a careful discussion to exclude errors\ndue to the finite size of the investigated models as well.\nIn the present paper, we will consider several model\nsystems according to their transport properties. This is\nmainly done by the bath coupling method as discussed\nabove, and by comparing with results from the Kubo for-\nmula. Let us start in Sect. II with an introduction to the\nQME, the necessary observables and the Monte Carlo\nwave-function technique24,25 which is used to integrate\nthe QME. Afterwards, we will present the results for sev-\neral model systems: for chainlike systems in Sect. III and\nmore complex ones in Sect. IV, followed by our summary\nand conclusion.\nII. BACKGROUND\nA. Model system\nThe considered system consists of N weakly coupled\nsubunits described by the Hamiltonian\nH\u02c6 = H\u02c6loc + H\u02c6int =\nN\u2211\n\u00b5=1\nh\u02c6(\u00b5) + J\nN\u22121\u2211\n\u00b5=1\nh\u02c6(\u00b5,\u00b5+1) . (1)\nThe first part H\u02c6loc of the Hamiltonian contains the local\nspectra of the subunits. The second part H\u02c6int describes\nthe interaction between adjacent sites with the coupling\nstrength J . Here, we require that the interaction is weak\nin the sense that the energy contained in the local part is\nmuch larger than the energy contained in the interaction\npart, \u3008H\u02c6loc\u3009 \u226b \u3008H\u02c6int\u3009.\nMore concretely, we will investigate one-dimensional\n(1D) or quasi-1D chains of two-level atoms or spin-1\/2\nparticles. Both, two-level atoms and spins, are described\nby the same algebra, and thus, it is convenient to use\nthe Pauli operators {1\u02c6, \u03c3\u02c6x, \u03c3\u02c6y, \u03c3\u02c6z} as a suitable operator\nbasis here. The above mentioned weak coupling claim\nis fullfilled by introducing a local Zeeman splitting \u21262 \u03c3\u02c6z,\nwhere we require that \u2126 is much larger than the cou-\npling constant J . Note that this weak internal coupling\nconstraint is a necessary precondition for the validity of\nthe master equation introduced below, i.e., we are not\nable to consider systems with \u2126 approaching the same\nmagnitude as J here. Hence, the models described by\nthe Hamiltonian given in Eq. (1) are not to be confused\nwith spin chains in cuprates, e.g., where the local field\nis always close to zero, and thus, small compared to the\ncoupling strength. However, the discussed models can be\nseen as spin chains in strong external fields, or simply as\nweakly coupled chains of two-level atoms as frequently\nconsidered in quantum optics and quantum information\ntheory.\nTo investigate the transport properties of these sys-\ntems, they will be explicitly coupled to independent en-\nvironments of different temperatures. Let us discuss the\nappropriate (QME)24 to describe this situation in the\nfollowing Section.\nB. Lindblad Quantum Master Equation\nIn general, the derivation of the QME from a mi-\ncroscopic model24 (a system coupled to an infinitely\nlarge environment) relies on some well known approxi-\nmation schemes the Markov26,27 assumption, the Born\napproximation and the secular approximation26,28. Re-\ncently, there was a discussion on how to derive a suitable\nLindblad29,30 QME in a nonequilibrium scenario23, i.e.,\nan equation to investigate transport in weakly coupled\nquantum systems. The Lindblad form of a QME defines\na trace and hermiticity preserving, completely positive\ndynamical map24,31, which thus retains all properties of\nthe density operator at all times. In order to approach\nthis dynamical equation the approximations are carefully\ncarried out in a minimally invasive manner, to retain the\ncentral nonequilibrium properties of the model. It was\nshown that this nonequilibrium Lindblad QME is in very\ngood accord with the results of the Redfield master24\nequation (non-Lindbladian), contrary to the standard\nLindblad QME in the weak coupling limit23.\nIn a nonequilibrium investigation, one needs two heat\nbaths at different temperatures locally coupled to the sys-\ntem, i.e., the heat baths couple only to a subunit at the\nedge of the system. The QME of such a situation yields\nd\u03c1\u02c6\ndt\n= \u2212i[H\u02c6, \u03c1\u02c6] +DL(\u03c1\u02c6) +DR(\u03c1\u02c6) , (2)\nwhere the dissipator DL refers to the left heat bath and\nDR to the right one, depending on the full density oper-\nator \u03c1\u02c6 of the system, i.e., the state of the chain described\nby the Hamiltonian (1). Both dissipators depend on the\ncoupling strength \u03bb between system and bath as well as\nthe temperature of the bath, respectively. Besides those\nincoherent damping terms, Eq. (2) contains a coherent\npart containing the Hamiltonian (1) of the system.\nThe dissipator describing the heat bath coupled to a\nsubunit at the edge of the system yields\nDF (\u03c1\u02c6) =\n2\u2211\nk,l=1\n(\u03b3F )kl\n(\nF\u02c6k\u03c1\u02c6F\u02c6\n\u2020\nl \u2212\n1\n2\n[F\u02c6 \u2020l F\u02c6k, \u03c1\u02c6]+\n)\n(3)\nwith F = L for the left and F = R for the right heat\nbath. The Lindblad operators F\u02c6k are given by\nL\u02c61 = \u03c3\u02c6\n(1)\n+ \u2297 1\u02c6\n(2) \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 1\u02c6(N) , (4a)\nL\u02c62 = \u03c3\u02c6\n(1)\n\u2212 \u2297 1\u02c6\n(2) \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 1\u02c6(N) , (4b)\nR\u02c61 = 1\u02c6\n(1) \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 1\u02c6(N\u22121) \u2297 \u03c3\u02c6\n(N)\n+ , (4c)\nR\u02c62 = 1\u02c6\n(1) \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 1\u02c6(N\u22121) \u2297 \u03c3\u02c6\n(N)\n\u2212 , (4d)\n3with the creation and annihilation operators \u03c3\u02c6\u00b1. Here,\nthe operators given in Eqs. (4a) and (4b) belong to the\nleft bath and those in Eqs. (4c) and (4d) to the right\none. The coefficient matrices depend on the respective\nbath temperature \u03b2F and are defined as\n\u03b3F =\n(\n\u0393F (\u2126)\n\u221a\n\u0393F (\u2126)\u0393F (\u2212\u2126)\u221a\n\u0393F (\u2126)\u0393F (\u2212\u2126) \u0393F (\u2212\u2126)\n)\n(5)\naccording to the rates\n\u0393F (\u2126) =\n\u03bb\u2126\ne\u03b2F\u2126 \u2212 1\n(6)\nwith the bath coupling strength \u03bb. This concrete form of\nthe \u03b3F -matrices follows from a phenomenological ansatz\nfor the spectral density of the environment, here chosen\nto be of Ohmic24,32 kind.\nA remarkable property of Eq. (3) is that it can be\nbrought into Lindblad form by diagonalizing the coef-\nficient matrices \u03b3F . The complete dissipative part of\nEq. (2) then reads\nD(\u03c1\u02c6) =\n4\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b1k\n(\nE\u02c6k\u03c1\u02c6E\u02c6\n\u2020\nk \u2212\n1\n2\n[E\u02c6\u2020kE\u02c6k, \u03c1\u02c6]+\n)\n(7)\nwith E\u02c6k being linear combinations of the operators F\u02c6k\ndefined in Eqs. (4a)-(4d) and \u03b1k being non-negative num-\nbers.\nThat it is indeed possible to derive a Lindbladian QME\nis very important here, since a standard stochastic unrav-\nelling of this special type of equation is feasible. Although\nextended stochastic schemes exist for the solution of gen-\neral QMEs such as, e.g., the Redfield equation33,34,35,\nthese methods have turned out to be less efficient, in\ngeneral, than the standard approach.\nC. Observables and Fourier\u2019s Law\nThe most interesting state of a nonequilibrium scenario\nis the local equilibrium state, i.e., the stationary state of\nthe QME (2). This state can be characterized by two\ncentral observables\u2014the energy gradient and the energy\ncurrent. Let us use\nh(\u00b5) = Tr{h\u02c6(\u00b5)\u03c1\u02c6(t)} (8)\nas a local energy density at site \u00b5 with \u03c1\u02c6(t) being the\nstate of the system at time t. Since we are investigating\ninternally weakly coupled subunits in the limit \u2126\u226b J the\nlocal energy density is approximated by the local Hamil-\ntonian here. Therefore, we neglect completely the contri-\nbutions to the local energy by the interaction. However,\ndue to the smallness of J , these parts would be very small\ncontributions to the above given energy density, and thus,\nwould not dramatically change the results.\nIn order to obtain a current operator between two ad-\njacent sites in the system, we consider the time evolu-\ntion of the local energy operator given by the Heisenberg\nequation of motion for operators at site \u00b5\nd\ndt\nh\u02c6(\u00b5) = i[H\u02c6, h\u02c6(\u00b5)] +\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nh\u02c6(\u00b5) . (9)\nSince h\u02c6(\u00b5) is not explicitly time dependent the last term\nvanishes. Inserting Eq. (1) into (9) yields\nd\ndt\nh\u02c6(\u00b5) = i\n(\n[h\u02c6(\u00b5\u22121,\u00b5), h\u02c6(\u00b5)] + [h\u02c6(\u00b5,\u00b5+1), h\u02c6(\u00b5)]\n)\n. (10)\nAssuming that the local energy is a conserved quantity\nwhich is justified when \u2126 \u226b J a discretized version of\nthe continuity equation yields\nd\ndt\nh\u02c6(\u00b5) = divJ\u02c6 = J\u02c6 (\u00b5,\u00b5+1) \u2212 J\u02c6 (\u00b5\u22121,\u00b5) . (11)\nBy comparing Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) we find for the cur-\nrent operator\nJ\u02c6 (\u00b5,\u00b5+1) = i[h\u02c6(\u00b5,\u00b5+1), h\u02c6(\u00b5)] . (12)\nFinally, the total energy current flowing from site \u00b5 to\nsite \u00b5+ 1 is defined as\nJ (\u00b5,\u00b5+1) = Tr{J\u02c6 (\u00b5,\u00b5+1)\u03c1\u02c6(t)} . (13)\nThe celebrated Fourier\u2019s law (here a discrete version)\nstates that in a proper diffusive situation, the current\ninside the system is proportional to the gradient, i.e.,\nJ (\u00b5,\u00b5+1) = \u2212\u03ba[h(\u00b5+1) \u2212 h(\u00b5)] , (14)\nhere written in terms of energy current and energy gra-\ndient. If both current and gradient are equal at all\nsites \u00b5, and furthermore, the gradient is finite, a bulk\nconductivity8,22 follows from\n\u03ba =\nJ (\u00b5,\u00b5+1)\nh(\u00b5) \u2212 h(\u00b5+1)\n. (15)\nThis is called normal or diffusive transport. On the other\nhand, if the gradient vanishes \u03ba diverges and the trans-\nport is called ballistic. However, that does not mean that\nthe current diverges as well. Due to the resistivity at the\ncontact to the heat bath (in our approach \u03bb), the current\nwill always remain finite.\nEven if we directly get a result in terms of normal or\nballistic behavior for all finite systems here, a nonzero\ngradient in the finite system is not sufficient to deduce\nnormal transport in the infinite one, too. The influence\nof the contact could dominate the investigation or long\nballistic waves could be suppressed in the finite system.\nThus, in order to obtain statements on the properties of\nthe infinite system (bulk properties), it is important to\ninvestigate scaling properties as well. For normal trans-\nport behavior, both gradient and current must tend to\n4zero for infinitely large systems. Then and only then the\nsystem shows diffusive behavior. A finite current within\nan infinite system will always indicate ballistic transport\nbehavior.\nNote that the current operator discussed in Eq. (12)\nis essentially the standard spin current operator, mul-\ntiplied by the (large) Zeeman splitting \u2126. Due to the\nZeeman splitting, there is an energy flow associated with\nany nonvanishing spin current. Only this energy flow is\ndescribed by Eq. (12), i.e., it does not contain any en-\nergy current that would be present even if \u2126 was zero.\nEventually, the stationary state of the QME (2) will fea-\nture such a nonvanishing spin current. Even though\nthe z-component of the magnetization is conserved on\nthe chain, the reservoirs may create and annihilate mag-\nnetization in z-direction. Hence, we do not compen-\nsate for this current by applying an adequate magnetic\ngradient in the sense of Onsager36,37 (magnetic Seebeck\neffect38). Doing so, for large \u2126, the energy flow described\nby Eq. (12) is the dominating part of the full energy cur-\nrent.\nD. Monte Carlo wave-function simulation\nIn order to investigate the transport according to the\nQME requires the stationary solution \u03c1\u02c6 of Eq. (2). From\n\u03c1\u02c6 all gradients and currents can be computed with Eq. (8)\nand Eq. (13). Unfortunately, Eq. (2) is an n2 dimensional\nsystem of linear differential equations if n is the dimen-\nsion of the Hilbert space. To find the stationary state\nof this equation one has to diagonalize a n2 \u00d7 n2 matrix\nwhich is restricted by the available memory.\nA very powerful technique to find the stationary state\nwithout diagonalizing the Liouvillian is based on the\nstochastic unraveling24 of the QME. The basic idea is to\ndepart from a statistical treatment by means of density\noperators and turn to a description in terms of stochas-\ntic wave functions. In fact, any QME of Lindblad form\ncan equivalently be formulated in terms of a stochastic\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation (SSE) for the wave function |\u03c8(t)\u3009\nd|\u03c8(t)\u3009 =\u2212 i G\u02c6(|\u03c8(t)\u3009) |\u03c8(t)\u3009 dt\n+\n\u2211\nk\n(\nE\u02c6k|\u03c8(t)\u3009\n\u2016E\u02c6k|\u03c8(t)\u3009\u2016\n\u2212 |\u03c8(t)\u3009\n)\ndnk , (16)\nwhich describes a piecewise deterministic process in\nHilbert space. The first term on the right hand side of\nEq. (16) describes the deterministic evolution generated\nby the nonlinear operator\nG\u02c6(|\u03c8(t)\u3009) = H\u02c6eff +\ni\n2\n\u2211\nk\n\u03b1k\u2016E\u02c6k|\u03c8(t)\u3009\u2016\n2 (17)\nwhere we have introduced the non-Hermitian, effective\nHamiltonian\nH\u02c6eff = H\u02c6 \u2212\ni\n2\n4\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b1kE\u02c6\n\u2020\nkE\u02c6k . (18)\nThe second term in Eq. (16) contains the Poisson incre-\nments dnk \u2208 {0, 1} which obey the following statistical\nproperties\n\u3008dnk\u3009 = \u2016E\u02c6k|\u03c8(t)\u3009\u2016\n2 dt (19)\ndnk dnl = \u03b4kl dnk . (20)\nThe stochastic process, defined by the SSE (16), can\nbe conveniently simulated by the following prescription.\nStarting from a normalized state, the first step of the\nunraveling procedure is to integrate the time-dependent\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation according to the effective Hamil-\ntonian defined in Eq. (18). Since it is not Hermi-\ntian the normalization of the state |\u03c8(t)\u3009 decreases until\n\u3008\u03c8(t)|\u03c8(t)\u3009 = \u03b7, with \u03b7 being a random number drawn\nfrom a uniform distribution on the interval {0, 1} at the\nbeginning of the step. Subsequently, a jump k takes place\naccording to the probability\npk =\n\u03b1k\u2016E\u02c6k|\u03c8(t)\u3009\u2016\n2\u2211\nk \u03b1k\u2016E\u02c6k|\u03c8(t)\u3009\u2016\n2\n. (21)\nHaving identified the jump k, the state |\u03c8(t)\u3009 is replaced\nby the normalized state\n|\u03c8(t)\u3009 \u2192\nE\u02c6k|\u03c8(t)\u3009\n\u2016E\u02c6k|\u03c8(t)\u3009\u2016\n.

This is of huge practical importance, as one deals\nwith wave functions with O(n) elements instead of den-\nsity operators with O(n2) elements.

Nevertheless, in practice, the time-averaging\nprocedure proves highly efficient, and results of sufficient\naccuracy could always be produced. It is further advis-\nable to discard the initial time evolution in the average in\norder to obtain reliable results, i.e., by choosing t0 \u226b 0.\nIn order to gain the standard deviation as a measure\nfor the statistical error as well one should compute the\nstationary expectation value of R realizations. Thus, its\nmean is obtained by\nA\u00af =\n1\nR\nR\u2211\nr=1\nAr , (25)\nand the standard deviation of the average yields\n\u03c32 =\n1\nR(R\u2212 1)\nR\u2211\nr=1\n(Ar \u2212 A\u00af)\n2 . (26)\nThese errors are influenced by the chosen sampling in-\nterval \u2206t the neglected steps at the beginning t0 and the\ntotal amount of time steps T being averaged over. For all\nnumerical results below we have chosen the parameters\n\u2206t = 1, t0 = 10\n4 and T between 105 and 106. For those\nsettings the errors are surprisingly small already.\nIII. CHAIN OF TWO LEVEL ATOMS\nFirst, we consider a chain of two-level atoms or spin-\n1\/2 particles as depicted in Fig. 1. In this case the local\npart of the Hamiltonian is just given by the mentioned\nZeeman splitting of the individual spin\nh\u02c6(\u00b5) =\n\u2126\u00b5\n2\n\u03c3\u02c6(\u00b5)z , (27)\nwith a splitting \u2126\u00b5 which may differ from site to site.\nApart from that \u2126 has to be large compared to the cou-\npling constant J to remain in the weak coupling limit.\nThe subunits are coupled by a generalized Heisenberg\ninteraction\nh\u02c6(\u00b5,\u00b5+1)\n= \u03c3\u02c6(\u00b5)x \u2297 \u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5+1)\nx + \u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5)\ny \u2297 \u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5+1)\ny +\u2206\u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5)\nz \u2297 \u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5+1)\nz .\n(28)\nN = 12\nN = 13\nN = 14\nN = 15\nN = 16\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\n0.12\nfit\nlo\nca\nl\nen\ner\ng\ny\nsystem number\/N\nFIG. 2: Local energies in a Heisenberg chain with length N =\n12\u221216. The system number is normalized by the chain length.\nThe fit is carried out for chain length N = 16 excluding site\none and 16. System parameters: J = 0.01, \u2206 = 1, \u2126 = 1,\n\u03bb = 0.01, \u03b2L = 0.5, \u03b2R = 0.25.\nFor \u2206 6= 1 the chain is called anisotropic chain and for\n\u2206 = 0 the present model is equivalent to the XY-model\n(Fo\u00a8rster coupling). In this case, by plugging Eq. (27)\nand the interaction given by Eq. (28) into Eq. (12), the\ncurrent operator yields\nJ\u02c6 (\u00b5,\u00b5+1) = iJ\u2126\u00b5\n[\n\u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5)\n+ \u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5+1)\n\u2212 \u2212 \u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5)\n\u2212 \u03c3\u02c6\n(\u00b5+1)\n+\n]\n. (29)\nThe above given system is coupled to heat baths of\ndifferent temperatures. The left bath is set to the inverse\ntemperature \u03b2L = 0.5, and the hotter one at the right\nhand side is at \u03b2R = 0.25. Both baths couple with the\nsame coupling strength \u03bb = 0.01 to the system.\nHaving computed the stationary state of Eq. (2) by us-\ning the method presented in Sect. II D one can compute\nboth the stationary energy profile within the system and\nthe current flowing through the system. In Fig. 2 the\ninternal gradient is shown for an isotropic chain \u2206 = 1\nof N = 12 \u2212 16 spins according to the same constant\nlocal field \u2126 = 1 and coupling strength J = 0.01. To\nshow that the gradient is equivalent for the different sys-\ntem sizes we have normalized the chain length in Fig. 2\nto one. The fit (line in Fig. 2) is carried out for system\nsize N = 16 excluding the sites one and 16, because of\nstrong influences of the contacts. Even if the fit is done\nfor system size 16 exclusively, all chains show the same\ngradient. However, the energy difference between adja-\ncent sites decreases for growing system sizes. The change\nin the internal gradient is shown in the upper diagram of\nFig. 3. Here the gradient is plotted over the reciprocal\nchain length. The error bars refer to an average over the\nenergy differences in all adjacent pairs of sites, where the\nfirst and last pairs have been neglected again as already\ndone in Fig. 2. As can be seen from Fig. 3 the gradient\ndecreases for larger systems until it approaches zero for\nan infinite chain which is in accordance with the expected\nbehavior in the thermodynamical limit.\nThe lower part of Fig. 3 shows the scaling behavior of\nthe current through the system.

The current decreases\nsimilar to the gradient, however, the extrapolation for\nthe infinitely long chain does not approach zero. A finite\ncurrent for an infinite system is a typical characteristic\nfor ballistic transport behavior. According to the data\nshown in Fig. 3 one could eventually conclude finding\nballistic transport in the Heisenberg chain.\nFigure 4 shows the local energy profile within the XY-\nmodel (\u2206 = 0). In comparison to Fig. 2 the profile within\nthe systems is flat. According to Fourier\u2019s law (14) this\ncould be interpreted as ballistic behavior in the investi-\ngated finite models of different lengths (cf. discussion in\nSect. II C). The local current between site \u00b5 and \u00b5 + 1\nremains finite although the gradient within the system\nvanishes. This local current is constant for all investi-\ngated system sizes and we find for the chosen parameters\n(5.33 \u00b1 0.05) \u00b7 10\u22124.

In order to get comparable data and errors all\nother parameters are kept constant. A decrease of the ex-\nternal coupling strength is combined with a decrease in\nthe global decay time of the system and a drastic change\nof the jump probabilities (21) as well. To gain a proper\nexpectation value from Eq. (24) with a rather small error\nit is crucial that the sampling time-step \u2206t of the contin-\nuous stochastic trajectory is chosen in a way that a suit-\nable amount of both coherent dynamics and stochastic\njumps enter the average. That means, if \u2206t is too large,\nso that after each coherent step follows a jump already,\nthe result of Eq. (24) will deteriorate. Thus, changing the\nexternal coupling strength would also require an adaption\nof the sampling parameter \u2206t. Furthermore, in case of\na larger decay time of the system also the parameter t0\n(initial neglect of data points) has to be increased. Thus,\nhaving fixed these parameters to get comparable data we\nare restricted to a small change of the external coupling\nstrength only. For the finite system an increase in the ex-\nternal coupling strength \u03bb denotes that a larger current\nis injected into the system, as follows from Fig. 5. The\nresistance of the contact is decreased. Finally, this also\nresults into a larger gradient within the system. Nev-\nertheless, Fig. 5 shows that even if the results for finite\nsystems changes drastically (especially for very small sys-\ntem sizes) the extrapolation for the infinite chain remains\nthe same within the accuracy of the fit.\nFigure 6 shows the scaling behavior of the current for\ndifferent values of the anisotropy \u2206 and Fig. 7 shows the\nscaling of the gradients, respectively. From the linear\nfits in Fig. 6 one could extrapolate the current within an\ninfinitely long chain. This current is shown in Fig. 8\nwith dependence on \u2206 (\u2206 = 1 refers to the Heisenberg\nchain and \u2206 = 0 to the XY-model).

Contrary to the Kubo investigation, a dc-\nconductivity directly follows from Eq. (15), in the present\nanalysis, if we assume for the moment that the linear scal-\ning of current and gradient found in Fig. 6 and 7 is also\nvalid for larger systems. According to the small errors\nfound in the above investigation, this assumption seems\nto be plausible. Thus, we are able to compute the con-\nductivity of the infinite system for \u2206 = 1.6 using Eq. (15)\nby dividing the slope of the current by the slope of the\nenergy gradient directly finding \u03ba\u221e = [2.34\u00b10.08] \u00b710\n\u22122.\nHere, the error follows from the uncertainty of the linear\nregression which is weighted already by the errors of the\ndata points.\nUnfortunately, the models which can be investigated\naccording to the suggested method are also restricted in\nsize. The main restriction here is not the size of mem-\nory, but the time one accepts to wait for the data. For\nthe present technique, the computing time scales expo-\nnentially with the system size. Thus, investigations how\ndisorder (random offset in the local field, random cou-\nplings) would change the above results are not available\nyet.\nLet us discuss another Heisenberg coupled chain of two\nlevel systems in the following.

This keeps the contact\nunchanged even if \u01eb is varied. The gradient of such a\nsystem is depicted in Fig. 9 and shows a modulation in\nthe local energies according to the change in the field.\nNevertheless we have fitted the gradient by a least square\nfit, shown for N = 14 in Fig. 9, and used such fits to\nobtain data for the gradient in systems with different size\n(upper part of Fig. 10).

Again we consider\ntwo-level systems with an energy splitting \u2126, here.

(31)\nBecause of the weak internal couplings one may use a\nspecial type of bath contact called private bath here. This\nmeans that each spin at the edges of the system is coupled\nto its own \u201cprivate\u201d heat bath with temperature \u03b2L at\nthe left hand side and \u03b2R at the right hand side. This\nis different from a more general approach where the two\nsystems at the edge are viewed as one four level system\neach, to which the respective heat bath couples. The\nconcept of private baths is only valid in the weak coupling\nlimit again, i.e., J, J \u2032 \u226a \u2126.\nIn Fig. 13 we show the internal gradient of a ladder\nwith N = 5 \u2212 7 rungs, according to the same coupling\nstrength in horizontal and vertical direction J = J \u2032 =\n0.01. Again we have normalized the length of the chain\nto fit all different chain lengths into the figure. As can\nbe seen from the figure the system features a nice linear\nenergy gradient, again. The scaling behavior of current\nand gradient for J = J \u2032 = 0.01 is depicted in Fig. 14.\nThere is no possibility to compute a reasonable error for\nthe system sizes N = 3 andN = 4. This is due to the fact\nthat forN = 3 there is no pair without a contact to a heat\nbath and for N = 4, there is just one energy difference\nin the center of the system away from the bath coupling.\n9 0.14\n 0.18\n 0.22\nN = 5\nN = 6\nN = 7\n0\n0.2\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\n0.24\n0.16\n0.12\nfit\nlo\nca\nl\nen\ner\ng\ny\nsystem number\/N\nFIG. 13: Local energies in a Heisenberg coupled ladder with\nN = 5 \u2212 7 rungs.

The errors for larger system sizes are surprisingly\nsmall, because of the large total system size. Due to the\ntoo small available system size and the strong influence of\nthe baths at the edges, the gradient in the small systems\nis essentially different from the gradient in larger ones.\nHowever, the current in small systems is already close to\nthe linear fit for larger system sizes.\nFigure 15 shows the current for the infinite system ex-\ntracted of the scaling analysis in dependence of the verti-\ncal coupling strength J \u2032. According to this investigation\nwe do not find normal transport in any of the considered\nladder models. The coupling strength J \u2032 = J already\nseems to be the minimum. For J \u2032 = 0 we get two com-\npletely independent Heisenberg chains with a maximum\nlength of seven spins. Larger values than J \u2032 = 0.02 could\nbe evaluated, however, results would be questionable be-\ncause the weak coupling limit is violated. Since the weak\ncoupling limit is crucial for the derivation of the underly-\ning QME, the results would be mathematically correct,\n0\n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02\n0.0001\n0.0002\n0.0003\n0.0004\n0.0005 double Heisenberg chain\nJ\n\u2032 = J\ncu\nrr\nen\nt\n(N\n\u2192\n\u221e\n)\nJ \u2032\nFIG. 15: Current of the infinite Heisenberg ladder versus the\nvertical coupling strength J \u2032.\nbut physically not interpretable.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn the present paper we have studied several models\nof two-level atoms or spin-1\/2 particles coupled to heat\nbaths of different temperatures. The investigation has\nbeen based on a recently derived quantum master equa-\ntion (QME) which simulates the nonequilibrium situation\nproperly. This QME is of Lindblad form and can, thus,\nbe efficiently unravelled using a standard Monte Carlo\nwave-function technique. The significant advantage of\nsuch an approach is its applicability to larger systems\nin comparison to the restricted system sizes which can\nbe investigated by a direct diagonalization of the Liou-\nvillian. This follows from the fact that the stochastic\nunraveling deals with wave functions rather than density\noperators. All interesting quantities are, here, given as\nmean values over stochastic trajectories and can be eval-\nuated to arbitrary precision by adjusting the amount of\ntimesteps averaged over. Here, we are interested mainly\nin the energy profile within the system and the energy\ncurrent through it. The analysis of both current and\ngradient in dependence of the system size gives informa-\ntion on the underlying transport behavior, which could\nbe, in principle, of ballistic or normal diffusive nature.\nFor finite systems, the method at hand always leads to\nan easily interpretable result, in terms of currents, energy\nprofiles, and the resulting conductivities. This is mainly\na result of the concrete design of the method by a direct\ncontact of the system with heat baths. The extrapola-\ntion to infinite system sizes, to extract bulk properties\nfrom the analysis of finite systems, is done by a careful\nscaling analysis of both gradients and currents. Finally,\nthis provides an indication of the type of transport in an\ninfinite probe of the model system as well.\nWe have analyzed a multitude of different concrete spin\nmodels here. Those systems consist of weakly coupled\ntwo-level atoms or spins. In the first part, we have in-\nvestigated chains according to different coupling models\n10\nTABLE II: Comparison between results for the energy trans-\nport (as defined by Eq.

The consideration was centered around\nthe generalized Heisenberg chain, i.e., a Heisenberg chain\nwith different ZZ-coupling strengths according to the pa-\nrameter \u2206 within the model. Among those, one promi-\nnent model is the XY-model with vanishing \u2206 featuring\nballistic transport in both the finite as well as the infinite\nmodel. Despite the relatively small system sizes investi-\ngated here, there are some hints for normal transport in\nthe models as well: The scaling analysis of the anisotropic\nmodel with \u2206 = 1.6 features a vanishing current for in-\nfinite chain size. Such a finding is typically connected\nto diffusive behavior. Second, the Heisenberg chain with\nalternating local field shows a zero current above some\nthreshold dependent on the difference of the local fields.\nBesides those investigations concerning the transport\nbehavior, we have also considered the dependence of the\nresults on the bath contact. Here, we find that the ex-\ntrapolated results do not crucially depend on the respec-\ntive coupling strength.\nIn the second part we have analysed a Heisenberg lad-\nder with different coupling strength in horizontal and ver-\ntical directions. According to this investigation of very\nshort ladders, no evidence for normal diffusive behavior\nwith dependence on the coupling strength in vertical di-\nrection is found. The extrapolated current remains finite\nover the complete accessible parameter space.\nIn a nutshell, the comparison between our results and\nresults based on the Kubo theory can eventually be sum-\nmarized in Tab. II.\nThe heat bath coupling approach to transport behavior\npresented in this paper features some significant advan-\ntages: Besides the direct determination of current and\ngradient in the finite system, and thus, of the conductiv-\nity in any concrete finite situation, the method also al-\nlows us to extract the conductivity of the infinite model\nby means of an extrapolation. This extrapolation relies\non the linear scaling behavior of current and gradient to-\nward zero, which is extracted from the analysis of finite\nsystem sizes. Thus, the direct coupling of reservoirs to\nmodel systems substantially improves the understanding\nof the transport behavior of such models on both small\nand infinite scales.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank H.-P.
