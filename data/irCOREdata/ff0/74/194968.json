Allen, Andrew Collick, and Alec J. Jeffreys \nDepartment of Genetics, University of Leicester, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK \nVectorette PCR permits the specific \namplification of DNA segments flank- \ning a known DNA sequence. It en- \nables the application of the PCR \nwhere sequence information is only \navailable for one primer site. We now \nshow that vectorette PCR can be used \nfor the systematic mapping and re- \ntrieval of transgene flanking DNA. \nWe also show that the sequence of \nlarge vectorette PCR fragments can \nbe obtained without cloning, by the \nproduction of subvectorette frag- \nments. \nPCR allows specific amplification of \nDNA fragments between two regions of \nknown sequence to which primers can \nbe directed. Often, however, molecular \nbiological techniques require the isola- \ntion and subsequent sequence analysis \nof unknown regions of DNA. PCR can be \nused to retrieve this unknown sequence \nif it is flanking a region of known se- \nquence. In this case, a primer can be de- \nsigned in either orientation from the \nknown sequence. Such techniques as in- \nverse PCR, panhandle PCR, capture PCR, \nand vectorette PCR have all been de- \nscribed as PCR methods for genome \nwalking.~ 1-4~ \nThe basic vectorette PCR strategy has \nbeen described previously. ~s~ Briefly, a \nvectorette-linker library is constructed \nfrom digested DNA for use in the PCR. \nThe duplex vectorette linker consists of \ntwo annealed oligonucleotides of com- \nplementary sequence flanking a nonho- \nmologous region resulting in a \"bubble\" \nin the DNA. The vectorette primer has an \nidentical sequence to the nonhomolo- \ngous region of the lower oligonucleotide \nand therefore cannot anneal directly to \nthe linker. The specificity of the PCR is \nachieved by performing primer xten- \nsion reactions from a sequence-specific \nprimer to a vectorette linker in the adja- \ncent unsequenced DNA. This results in \nthe synthesis of a strand complementary \nto the vectorette linker, thus generating \na target sequence for the vectorette-spe- \ncific primer in subsequent PCR cycles. In \nthis way, a specific DNA fragment can be \namplified from a complex fragment mix- \nture and recovered for use in sequencing \nreactions. \nPreviously, vectorette technology has \nbeen used to isolate terminal sequences \nfrom yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) \ninserts, in the determination of exon \nstructures and in the recovery of un- \nknown bacterial sequences. ~4-6~ In this \npaper we detail its use in the systematic \nisolation of 5'- and 3'-flanking junction \nsequences around mouse transgenes of \nthe minisatellite MS32. MS32 is a hu- \nman minisatellite composed of a tan- \ndem array of 29-bp repeat-unit sequence \nvariants. The interspersion of these \nsequence variants can be assayed in \nthe minisatellite variant repeat (MVR)- \nPCR ~7~, which utilizes repeat-unit-spe- \ncific primers. MS32 has a high muta- \ntion rate in humans, and knowledge of \nthe flanking mouse sequences around \ntransgenes of this locus is important in \nascertaining any positional effects on \ntransgene mutation rate and process. \nIt was therefore necessary to isolate at \nleast one flanking sequence junction \naround each of eight transgenes of the \nMS32 locus. Vectorette PCR was chosen \nas a swift method for isolating transgene \nflanking sequence products, obviating \nthe need for cloning of the junction \nregions. The double-stranded products \nobtained were sequenced using PCR- \nbased double-stranded sequencing \nmethods. Most double-stranded PCR se- \nquencing methods will only give 200- \n300 bp from each end of a fragment. \nTherefore, to access full sequence infor- \nmation for the original vectorette frag- \nment, subvectoretting procedures were \ndeveloped to provide a series of overlap- \nping contigs for sequencing. We also \nshow how the specificity of the vector- \nette library can be increased by the use of \nsize-selected fragments and how par- \ntially digested DNA can be used to give a \nseries of flanking products, aiding struc- \ntural analysis. In this paper vectorette \nanalysis of three MS32 transgenic loci, \ncalled 110D, 102B, and 110A, is de- \nscribed. \n4:71-75\u000e9 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press ISSN 1054-9803\/94 $5.00 PCR Methods and Applications 71 \n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 27, 2015 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \nVectorette Production \nThe sequences of the vectorette top and \nbottom strands are detailed in Figure 1. \nOligonucleotides were synthesized in \nthe Department of Biochemistry, Uni- \nversity of Leicester, on an Applied Bio- \nsystems 380B DNA synthesizer, using re- \nagents supplied by Cruachem. Ten \nmicrograms of vectorette top strand and \n10 I~g of vectorette bottom strand were \nannealed at 60~ for 30 min in 20 I~l of \n0.1 M NaC1, 10 mM MgC12, and 10 mM \nTris-HC1 (pH 7.6) to produce a complete \nvectorette linker. Neither vectorette oli- \ngonucleotide was 5' phosphorylated. \nDNA Digestion, Preparation, and \nLigation \nApproximately 2 t~g of genomic DNA di- \ngested with a six-cutter restriction en- \nzyme was ligated to 0.2 p.g of annealed \nvectorette linker in 20 t~l of 50 mM NaC1, \n20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mM DTT, and \n0.1 mM ATP, with 2 units of T4 ligase \n(GIBCO BRL) overnight at 15~ for sticky \nend ligations and 4~ for blunt-ended li- \ngations. The amount of vectorette linker \nin the reaction was increased to 2 I~g for \ntotal genomic DNA ligations cleaved \nwith a restriction endonuclease recog- \nnizing a 4-bp cleavage site. Control liga- \ntions without DNA were also prepared, \nand ligation was monitored by removal \nof a 3-1~1 aliquot and addition of 0.5 I~g \nof k DNA cleaved with HindIII and then \nagarose lectrophoresis after ligation. Li- \ngations (\"vectorette libraries\") were di- \nluted with 5 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.6) to 5 \ni~g\/ml of genomic DNA and stored at \n- 20oc. \nVectorette PCR Amplification \nHot start PCR was performed to prevent \nthe annealing of the top- and bottom- \nstrand vectorette oligonucleotides and \nany subsequent template-directed exten- \nsion from the free 5' end of the top vec- \ntorette strand, which would not have li- \ngated to the 3' end of the template top \nstrand. This obviated the need for 5' \nphosphorylation of the top strand of the \nvectorette oligonucleotide. Ten nano- \ngrams of vectorette genomic DNA was \ndiluted to 10 I~l with water, denatured at \n96~ for 3 min, and then held at 80~ \nTen microliters of 2x concentrated PCR \nbuffer, primers, and Taq poymerase \n(Perkin-Elmer Cetus AmpliTaq) were \nadded, to give a final concentration of 1 \n~l.M transgene primer, 1 ~M vectorette \nprimer, and 0.06 U\/l~l of Taq polymerase. \nPCR buffer was as described previ- \nously. (7) Amplification was at 96~ for \n1.2 min, 68~ for 1 min, 70~ for 3 min \nfor 30 cycles on a Perkin-Elmer Cetus \nthermal cycler. Vectorette PCR products \nwere detected by agarose gel elec- \ntrophoresis followed by Southern blot \nhybridization or ethidium bromide \nstaining and visualisation by long-wave- \nlength UV. Appropriate DNA fragments \nwere recovered by electroelution onto \ndialysis membrane and reamplified with \nvectorette and transgene primers for 25- \n30 cycles depending on yield.

Full or partial digestions \nwith enzymes cleaving within the initial \nvectorette product were performed on \n200-300 ng of initial product. The di- \ngested DNA was phenol-extracted and \nrecovered by ethanol precipitation. \nTwenty nanograms of blunt-ended vec- \ntorette linker was annealed to 10- to 15- \nng DNA fragments in a 20-1~1 reaction us- \ning the previous ligation conditions. \nReamplifications were performed on 1 i~l \nof a 1:20 dilution of this subvectorette \nlibrary for 25 cycles using the second \nvectorette primer plus either the trans- \ngene primer or the first vectorette \nprimer. PCR products were repurified by \nagarose gel electrophoresis and electroe- \nlution followed by ethanol precipitation. \nRESULTS \nThe structure of the MS32 allele used in \ntransgenesis is detailed in Fig. 2. It has 71 \nrepeat units of a- or t-type, each repeat \nbeing 29 bp long. Standard restriction di- \ngestion and Southern blot analysis were \nperformed on mice positive for trans- \ngene insertion. This identified appropri- \nate restriction sites around the transgene \nfor use in vectorette PCR to recover \nmouse flanking DNA sequences. \nTransgene 1 IOD \nRestriction mapping showed this to be a \nsingle-copy insertion of the transgene \nconstruct with the loss of 10 repeat units \nbut with full 5' and 3' MS32 flanking \nsequences. There was a lack of common \nfour- and six-cutter restriction sites in \nthe flanking mouse DNA, but the en- \nzyme AvaII cleaved frequently and was \nutilized in the preparation of a vectorette \nlibrary. A size fraction of AvaII-digested \n110D positive mouse genomic DNA, \nknown to contain the transgene frag- \nment, was recovered by electroelution \nfrom agarose and used in the prepara- \ntion of the vectorette library.

Sequencing \nthe 5' and 3' junction fragments con- \nfirmed the unusual lack of restriction \nsites in the flanking DNA that was attrib- \nutable to the -y satellite nature of the se- \nquence. \nTransgene 102B \nRestriction mapping showed this single- \ncopy transgene to have intact 3' MS32 \nhuman flanking DNA but no 5' flanking \nsequences. The mouse flanking DNA se- \nquences again showed an unusual lack \nof most restriction sites other than for \nAvail. AvaII was again chosen to con- \nstruct a vectorette library using partially \ndigested 102B genomic DNA. Vectorette \nPCR amplifications were used as a map- \nping tool to generate products extending \nout to a number of AvaII sites in the 5'- \nand 3'-flanking DNA (Fig. 4A, B). Ampli- \nfications with the 32E and Vecl primers \ngave four bands, representing products \nextending to four flanking AvaII sites. E1 \nand Vecl primer amplification only gave \nproducts extending to the first three of \nthese AvaII sites, presumably owing to \nthe favored amplification of shorter \nproducts. Mouse -y satellite DNA has a \n234-bp repeating sequence. ~9~ Avail \ncleaves at a variant position in some -y \nsatellite repeat units producing a 234- or \n468-bp periodicity of digestion. This pe- \nriodicity is seen in the flanking Avail re- \nstriction map determined from vector- \nette PCR products, suggesting strongly \nthat the flanking mouse DNA is gamma \nsatellite. \nAs there was no 5' human MS32 \nflanking DNA, a heminested strategy for \nsize reduction of the initial 5' vectorette \nPCR products (Vecl\/E1 and Vecl\/32E; \nFig. 4B) was developed using MVR-PCR. \nFor this reaction the Vecl primer was \nused as the flanking primer, and the re- \npeat unit-specific primers 32-TAG-A or \n32-TAG-T were used as the transgene \nprimers to produce a series of products \nextending from the closest AvaII site in \nthe 5'-flanking mouse DNA to each a- or \nt-type repeat unit in the transgene MS32 \narray (Fig. 4C). The first repeat unit in \nthe array is an a- type repeat, and the \nappropriate band from the MVR-PCR \n(indicated by an arrow in Fig. 4C) was \nelectroeluted and amplified for sequenc- \ning, which confirmed the ~\/satellite se- \nquence of the mouse DNA. \nThe 3'-flanking mouse DNA was re- \ncovered by vectorette PCR using primer \nPCR Methods and Applications 73 \n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 27, 2015 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nFIGURE 4 The structure of the 102B transgene and associated vectorette PCR products.

A \nheminested strategy using the reverse \nprimer of 32A (Fig. 1) with Vecl was used \nto recover this fragment for sequencing, \nwhich showed that the mouse sequence \nwas ~\/satellite. \nTransgene 110A \nRestriction mapping identified this \ntransgene as a complex multicopy array \nof the original construct. The enzyme \nMboI does not cleave in the original con- \nstruct but cleaves in the mouse DNA 1.3 \nkb upstream of the 5' end of the multi- \ncopy array. A complete MboI digest was \nperformed on the genomic DNA, and \nMboI vectorettes were ligated. The initial \namplification using primer 32OR di- \nrected toward the 5'-flanking mouse \nDNA produced a 1.34-kb product detect- \nable by ethidium bromide staining fol- \nlowing agarose gel electrophoresis. This \nwas too long for full double-stranded \nPCR sequencing. Restriction mapping of \nthis product revealed a number of blunt- \nend restriction sites to which a universal \nblunt-end novel sequence vectorette \n(Vec3) could be annealed (Fig. 5). The \n1.34-kb DNA fragment was either fully \ndigested with AluI or HincII or partially \ndigested with RsaI (because there were \ntwo sites to access with Vec3) and phe- \nnol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated, \nbefore the novel Vec3 was ligated. These \nsubvectorette libraries were reamplified \nusing 32OR and Vec3, and the products \nwere recovered for sequencing. Se- \nquence analysis of the original vector- \nette products and the four subvectorette \nproducts produced a complete sequence \ncontig of the 5'-mouse flanking DNA, \nwhich was shown to be a unique se- \nquence. \nDISCUSSION \nIn this paper we discuss the use of vec- \ntorette PCR as a method of systemati- \ncally isolating mouse DNA adjacent o \ntransgene insertions as a prelude to DNA \nsequence analysis and show that vector- \nettes provide a highly flexible approach \nto the mapping and recovery of se- \nquences from complex genomes. In this \nstudy we were able to isolate and se- \nquence at least one junction from each \nof eight different transgenic inserts, \nwithout the need for cloning via ge- \nnomic DNA libraries. Junction frag- \nments up to 3.7 kb in length were suc- \ncessfully recovered by vectorette PCR. \nThe ability to recover specific vector- \nette PCR products depends on the com- \nplexity of genomic DNA, the frequency \nof restriction sites in the DNA used to \nprepare the vectorette libraries, and the \nspecificity of vectorette and transgene \nprimers. The latter was optimized by de- \nsigning primers with a relatively high \nGC content (54--58%), which permitted \nthe use of a high annealing temperature \n(67~ during PCR. In some cases, speci- \nficity was sufficiently high to enable the \ncorrect vectorette PCR products to be \nidentified after the first round of PCR by \nagarose gel electrophoresis and staining \nwith ethidium bromide. In other cases, \nparticularly if the vectorette library was \n74 PCR Methods and Applications \n Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on November 27, 2015 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from \nFIGURE 5 The structure of the 5' region of the multicopy transminisatellite 110A and associated \nvectorette and subvectorette PCR products. The initial Vecl product used an MboI vectorette \nlinker and the subvectorette was produced using a blunt-ended Vec3 linker ligated to sites for \nAluI (Al), RsaI (R), and HinclI (Hc). \nconstructed from genomic DNA cleaved \nwith frequently cutting restriction en- \nzymes (e.g., MboI), relatively complex \nsets of PCR products were frequently ob- \ntained. Two approaches were used to cir- \ncumvent his problem. First was knowl- \nedge of the size of the restriction \nfragment containing the transgene n- \nabled restricted genomic DNA to be size- \nfractionated by agarose gel electrophore- \nsis, followed by the recovery of a size \nfraction containing the transgene frag- \nment. This type of fractionation was per- \nformed in the recovery of transgene \n110D flanking DNA to reduce the com- \nplexity of the vectorette library 10- to \n100-fold and to substantially improve \nthe specificity of the vectorette PCR. The \nsecond approach was to perform a first \nround of vectorette PCR amplification, \nthen to detect products by Southern blot \nhybridization, recover by gel fraction- \nation, and reamplify using a second \nnested transgene primer; this heminest- \ning strategy can also simplify the profile \nof vectorette PCR products. \nThe use of partially digested genomic \nDNA in vectorette libraries also provides \na general method of mapping restriction \nsites adjacent o a transgene, as shown \nfor transgene 102B. Such mapping data \ndoes not only provide clues about the \nnature of the mouse flanking DNA, but it \ncan also generate primary vectorette \nproducts extending for any required dis- \ntance into the flanking DNA, without \nthe need for detailed restriction map- \nping prior to vectorette PCR. Similarly, \nvectorette PCR can also be used to ex- \nplore the structure of the transgene it- \nself. For example, it is possible to per- \nform MVR-PCR directly on primary \nvectorette libraries (data not shown) to \ncreate PCR products extending from a \nflanking restriction site to each a- or \nt-type repeat unit within the minisatel- \nlite array. This makes it possible to deter- \nmine transgene structures in the absence \nof suitable flanking human DNA and \ngives direct information on the distance \nbetween the flanking mouse restriction \nsite and the start of the MS32 repeat ar- \nray. \nVectorette PCR can also be used as a \ntool to aid sequence analysis of large \nPCR products by subvectoretting. Our \ngeneral strategy is to partially digest \nlarge PCR products with frequently cut- \nting restriction enzymes that yield blunt- \nend DNA fragments, followed by liga- \ntion of a second vectorette and specific \namplification of a set of DNA fragments \nextending from one of the original prim- \ners (the first vectorette primer or a trans- \ngene primer) to each of the blunt-end \nsites capped with the second vectorette. \nIn this way, sets of nested deletions can \nbe rapidly generated and used for se- \nquence contig construction. We would \nnote, however, that in our experience, \nblunt-end vectorettes work very ineffi- \nciently in PCR amplifications from pri- \nmary genomic vectorette libraries and \ndo not provide a useful means for isolat- \ning transgene\/flanking DNA junctions \nfrom genomic DNA. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \nWe thank Debra Langton for oligonucle- \notide synthesis and Annette Macleod for \nhelpful discussions on the vectorette \nPCR technique.
