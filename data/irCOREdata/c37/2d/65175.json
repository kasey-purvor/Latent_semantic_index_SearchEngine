A large fraction of wind turbine downtime\nis due to bearing failures, particularly in the generator and gear-\nbox.

INTRODUCTION\nINCREASING land constraints across Europe have led to thedevelopment of wind farms offshore with new challenges,\nparticularly with regard to operations and maintenance. Access\nto turbines for maintenance and repair may be significantly\nrestricted during periods of high wind speed and significant\nwave height, particularly during the winter. It has been suggested\nthat operations and maintenance costs for offshore wind farms\ncould account for up to 30% of the energy costs [1]. There is a\nneed, therefore, for early warning when problems may be about\nto occur for a particular wind turbine.

However, in general to\ndate, more conventional vibration sensor approaches have been\nfavored [6]\u2013[8].\nBearing problems account for between 21% and 95%, re-\nspectively, of all failures [9] in electrical machines, and for\ninduction machines of the size and type used in wind turbines\nthis figure is probably >45%. Therefore, early detection of such\nproblems would significantly reduce wind turbine downtime if\nmaintenance could then be planned in advance. Vibration mon-\nitoring has been applied to conventional power generation with\ngenerators running at a fixed frequency and current monitoring\nhas been deployed, primarily motor current signature analysis\n(MCSA), for inferring problems due to broken rotor bars and air\ngap eccentricity, e.g., [10]\u2013[12]. Instantaneous power has also\nbeen used to monitor such faults [13], including in the case of a\nwind turbine generator [14]. Indeed, the monitoring of power, as\nopposed to current, may yield more information with regard to\ninduction machine faults [15] because of its ability to deal with\nall three phases under both balanced or unbalanced conditions.\nMore recently, work has extended to monitoring instantaneous\npower to detect bearing damage [16].\nThe use of wavelets in the analysis of electrical machine cur-\nrent waveforms has been established for fault diagnosis of rotor\neccentricity in a brushless dc machine [17] and in the detec-\ntion of broken rotor bars in an induction machine [18]. These\nexamples have employed steady-state monitoring. The moni-\ntoring by wavelets of transient current signals during machine\nstart-up can also yield useful information with respect to bro-\nken rotor bars [19]\u2013[23]. Although there has been much work\nlooking at the application of wavelets and Fourier transforms\nto the detection of broken rotor bars, this type of failure repre-\nsents a negligible fraction of generator faults in wind turbines.\nMore recently, the use of wavelets for detecting shaft misalign-\nment and bearing problems using the power signal has been\ndemonstrated for the condition monitoring of variable speed\nwind turbines [24]. The use of wavelets has an advantage over\nFourier analysis when analyzing nonstationary signals, such as\nare seen in variable speed electrical machines.\n0885-8969\/$26.00 \u00a9 2010 IEEE\n716 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 25, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2010\nIn this paper, we present the analysis of the power output\nof a DFIG by the use of wavelets to detect rotor eccentricity.\nThe theory behind the wavelet analysis is presented and the\nprinciple of analyzing particular frequency components charac-\nteristic of mechanical and electrical faults is established. The\nmethod is then applied to a laboratory test rig under known fault\nconditions, first in fixed and then in variable-speed operation. Fi-\nnally, the method is applied to two operational, variable-speed,\npitch-regulated wind turbines with DFIGs (1.5 and 2.5 MW,\nrespectively), where rotor eccentricity was detected and, in the\ncase of one of these turbines, well in advance of an eventual\nbearing failure.\nII. MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF INDUCTION MACHINE\nPOWER OUTPUT\nA. Characteristic Signatures in Power Output\nFor an induction machine where static and dynamic eccen-\ntricity may be present, fault characteristics at a frequency of\nf1 \u00b1mfr in the stator current [13] will appear where f1 is the\nsupply frequency, fr is the machine rotational frequency and\nm is a positive integer. This component manifests itself in the\ninstantaneous single-phase power as in (1)\np(t) =\n\u221a\n3\n2\n\u00d7\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nUm1Im1 [cos(2\u03c91t\u2212 \u03d5) + cos\u03d5]\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nm=1\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nUm1Iecpm\n[\ncos ((2\u03c91 \u2212m\u03c9r )t\u2212 \u03d5ecpm)\n+ cos (m\u03c9rt + \u03d5ecpm)\n]\n+Um1Iecnm\n[\ncos ((2\u03c91 + m\u03c9r )t\u2212 \u03d5ecnm)\n+ cos (m\u03c9rt\u2212 \u03d5ecnm)\n]\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe\n\uf8fc\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe\n(1)\nwhere\nUm1 maximum value of the supply line-to-line volt-\nage;\nIm1 maximum value of the fundamental supply cur-\nrent;\nIecpm maximum value of the fault characteristic com-\nponent in the stator current at a frequency of\nf1 + mfr ;\nIecnm maximum value of the fault characteristic com-\nponent in the stator current at a frequency of\nf1 \u2212mfr ;\n\u03d5ecpm initial value of the phase angle for fault charac-\nteristic component at a frequency of f1 + mfr ;\n\u03d5ecnm initial value of the phase angle for fault charac-\nteristic component at a frequency of f1 \u2212mfr ;\n\u03c91 = 2\u03c0f1 stator supply angular frequency;\n\u03c9r = 2\u03c0fr rotor angular velocity;\n\u03d5 initial phase angle of the fundamental supply\ncurrent.\nThis gives rise to a number of components in the instanta-\nneous power, namely a dc component, a component at a fre-\nquency of 2f1 , components at frequencies of 2f1 \u2213mfr , and\nadditional components at frequencies of mfr . In [13], it was\nalso shown that for a similar analysis where broken rotor bars\nwere present, additional components at 2ksf1 should be seen in\nthe instantaneous power, where s is the slip defined as\ns =\nf1 \u2212 pfr\nf1\n(2)\nwhere p is the number of pole pairs. It is easy to show that\nin the case of eccentricity, when m = 2p, then a characteristic\ncomponent at a frequency of 2sf1 in the instantaneous power\nshould be seen. Indeed, the experimental results in [13] confirm\nthis, where the Fourier transform of the instantaneous power\nfrom a three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor was analyzed.\nThe 2sf1 component appears in the case where the machine\nhad an induced eccentricity, and this component increased in\nmagnitude when the motor had increasing numbers of broken\nrotor bars.\nThese \u201cadditional components\u201d (mfr and 2ksf1) may not\nbe the only frequency components characteristic of eccentricity\nand broken rotor bars. Indeed, Tavner [9] reports that frequency\ncomponents of 2ksf1\/p and 2k(1\u2212 s)f1\/p will be observed\nwhen a broken rotor bar occurs. These components arise from\nthe interaction of the electromagnetic air gap torque and the\nmechanical torque reaction, dependent upon the drive inertia.\nThey are seen in the power signal as there is coupling between\nthe shear stress field supporting the torque reaction and the air\ngap magnetic field.\nThere are similarities between the effects of rotor electrical\nimbalance and an eccentric rotor which mean that a rotor imbal-\nance, whether due to electrical effects or an eccentric air gap, is\nlikely to give rise to additional components which are indicative\nof both these faults, albeit their magnitudes may differ. This\nmeans that the 2ksf1\/p and 2k(1\u2212 s)f1\/p components may\nalso appear in the case of an eccentric rotor. To date, the authors\nare not aware of a full mathematical analysis of these current\nand power frequency components and further work will be re-\nquired to establish this for both rotor winding asymmetry and\neccentric rotors in induction machines.\nAnalysis of the 2ksf1 and 2ksf1\/p frequency components\nof the instantaneous power has the advantage that these are\ngenerally of low frequency. For a wind turbine, sampling of\nsensors that may be used for the detection of modes of oscillation\nof the turbine structure are required to be in this same low\nfrequency range.\nB. Analysis of the Power using Wavelets\nMCSA and instantaneous power analysis of electrical ma-\nchines has been done using Fourier transforms, e.g., [13], [15],\n[16]. This yields satisfactory results when the machine is running\nat fixed speed but is more problematic to apply in variable-speed\nsituations. The majority of large modern wind turbines operate\nunder variable-speed conditions.\nShort-term Fourier transforms (STFTs) may be used, how-\never, they have the drawback of giving a fixed time and fre-\nquency resolution at all frequencies and there will always be a\ntradeoff between frequency and time resolution. Wavelet trans-\nforms have the feature that they give better frequency resolution\nWATSON et al.: CONDITION MONITORING OF THE POWER OUTPUT OF WIND TURBINE GENERATORS USING WAVELETS 717\n(but worse time resolution) at low frequencies and better time\nresolution (but worse frequency resolution) at high frequencies.\nThis is in general desirable for most practical signals where\nhigher frequency components tend to be short-lived whereas\nlower frequency components tend to be longer in duration. As\ndescribed earlier, the use of wavelets has been investigated for\nthe detection of eccentricity and broken rotor bars in dc and\ninduction machines by the analysis of machine currents. In this\npaper, we adopt the use of wavelets for the analysis of the ma-\nchine instantaneous three-phase power to deal with these issues\nof variable speed. There are other potential tools for time- and\nfrequency-domain analysis of the power signal, however, the\npurpose of this paper is not to provide an in depth analysis of\nthese techniques, rather to illustrate the practical application of\na signal-processing technique that is able to cope with a non-\nstationary signal for the purposes of detecting a fault on a wind\nturbine generator shaft.\nThe continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of a time series\nx(t), in this paper, and the instantaneous three-phase power p(t),\nis given by\nWa,b(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nx(t)\u03c8\u2217a,b(t)dt. (3)\nThis is a function of the so-called daughter wavelets defined\nas transformations of the mother wavelet\n\u03c8a,b(t) =\n1\u221a\na\n\u03c8\n(\nt\u2212 b\na\n)\n(4)\nwhere t is time, a is the scale applied to the mother wavelet, and\nb is the translation applied to the mother wavelet.\nThe CWT, thus, gives information with regard to the correla-\ntion between the mother wavelet and the signal, which is being\nanalyzed in both time domain (related to b) and frequency do-\nmain (related to a), respectively. The mother wavelet used, in\nthis paper, is based on the Morlet wavelet as defined in the\nMathWorks MATLAB software Wavelet Toolbox, namely\n\u03c8(t) = e\u2212\nt 2\n2 sin(\u03c3t) (5)\nwhere the default value of \u03c3 = 5 was used that represents a\nreasonable balance between frequency and temporal resolution.\nThe Morlet wavelet is essentially a sinusoidal oscillation,\nwhich is localized using a Gaussian function. It is, therefore,\nwell suited to the analysis of a signal where a periodic shock\nevent is to be detected, such as is the case with a shaft misalign-\nment and a worn bearing. The discussion described in Section II\nhas indicated that perturbations such as rotor eccentricity re-\nsulting from shaft misalignment will modulate the power signal\nand the frequency of this modulation will vary in the case\nof a variable-speed wind turbine. The objective of using the\nMorlet wavelet transform was to localize a given variable fre-\nquency component (2ksf1 and 2ksf1\/p) in time and determine\nits magnitude. This was then used as an indicator of the severity\nof shaft misalignment, which could be the precursor to eventual\nbearing failure.\nThe aforementioned CWT was applied to the power output\nfrom generators in both a test rig and a variable-speed wind\nturbine, sampled at 3 kHz and 32 Hz, respectively. The test\nFig. 1. Wind turbine condition monitoring test rig. (a) Schematic presentation\nof the test rig. (b) Photograph of the test rig.\nrig was sampled at a higher frequency simply to capture higher\nfrequency components in other signals not considered in this pa-\nper. The results of these analyses are described in the following\nsection.\nIII. RESULTS OF GENERATOR POWER ANALYSIS\nA. Test Rig\nA test rig was used to simulate a fault as might be seen\nin a variable-speed wind turbine with a DFIG. The test rig\nconsisted of a 50-kW dc variable-speed drive connected via a\n5:1 gearbox to a four-pole DFIG connected as a wound rotor\ninduction generator as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe test rig was controlled using LabVIEW software to drive\nthe dc motor and collect data from the drive train, including\ngenerator torque, rotor speed, current, and voltage. The motor\ncould be driven at a variable speed to realistically simulate the\nchanging aerodynamic torque on a wind turbine rotor. A number\nof faults could be applied to the wound rotor induction generator,\nincluding circuit imbalance by adjusting the balance of the rotor\nresistors in the resistance bank, to emulate the effect of a faulty\nor eccentric rotor. The test rig is described in more detail in [13].\nThe rotor circuit imbalance was applied under both fixed\nand variable-speed operating conditions. The test rig was run\nfor a period of 100 s and the rotor circuit imbalance applied\nand removed alternately in 20 s bursts. In this way, the rig\nwas made to operate during the experiments under alternately\n\u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cfaulty\u201d conditions. Data were sampled at 3 kHz.\nA CWT, as described above, was applied to the time series of the\n718 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 25, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2010\nFig. 2. CWT of test rig power signal for circuit imbalance during (a) fixed\nspeed and (b) variable-speed conditions. The double-headed arrows show the\ncondition when the circuit imbalance was applied (\u201cfaulty\u201d state) otherwise the\nmachine was in the healthy state.\nthree-phase power output, calculated from the three-phase cur-\nrent and voltage measurements.\nThe test rig experiments were performed with alternating pe-\nriods of \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cfaulty\u201d conditions, to allow a relative\ncomparison between frequency components in the power signal\nunder these two operating conditions. Fig. 2(a) shows the result\nof this CWT for the test rig run at a fixed speed with the cir-\ncuit imbalance applied periodically. The scale parameter a has\nbeen converted to a frequency in Hertz on the vertical axis and\nthe time in seconds is shown on the horizontal axis. Because\nof the characteristics of the wavelet transform, the bandwidth\nincreases with increasing frequency (decreasing a). There are\nthree relatively prominent bands that can be seen: the most\nprominent corresponding to 2sf1 , and two further bands at f1\nand 2f1 . The magnitude of these three bands clearly shows an\nabrupt increase when the circuit imbalance was applied (faulty\ncondition). There is some evidence of a band at 2sf1\/p though\nits magnitude is significantly less than the other three bands.\nFig. 2(b) shows a similar CWT for the case where the test rig\nwas run at a variable speed to simulate the case of a variable-\nspeed wind turbine under changing wind speed conditions when\noperating between cut-in and rated wind speed. Once again, the\nthree frequency bands corresponding to 2sf1 , f1 and 2f1 can\nbe seen. The band at 2sf1\/p is more visible than for the fixed\nspeed case. As expected the f1 and 2f1 bands are horizontal\nlines, whereas the 2sf1 band varies in frequency as the slip\nof the generator varies in response to changes in rotor speed.\nFig. 3. Daily root mean squared value of the CWT of the 1.5-MW wind turbine\npower corresponding to a frequency of 2sf1\/p.\nAlso, the magnitudes of all three bands show an abrupt increase\nin the faulty condition when the circuit imbalance is applied.\nThe increase in magnitude of the 2sf1\/p band is less obvious.\nThese frequencies were all much less than the 3 kHz collection\nfrequency of the test rig.\nIt should be noted here that the magnitude of the faults ap-\nplied represent extreme conditions. In reality, the level of fault\nseen in an operational wind turbine will be lower. The point of\nmonitoring such as the 2sf1 component using a wavelet is that\nits magnitude shows an increase under fault conditions and that\nit can be tracked easily in time even though its frequency may\nbe constantly changing.\nB. Operational Wind Turbines\nA 1.5-MW variable-speed pitch-regulated wind turbine with a\nDFIG was instrumented to provide moderate frequency (32 Hz)\ndata for a number of operational parameters including rotational\nspeed and three-phase power output. Additional sensors were\ninstalled on the turbine to provide high-frequency vibration data\non the gearbox and generator. Ten-minute data from the stan-\ndard supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system\nwere also collected. Data were recorded over a period of two\nyears and a CWT applied to the three phase power data. In order\nto reduce power signal noise, the power data were filtered so\nthat only values less than 40 kW were used in the CWT trans-\nform. This meant that this was applied only when the turbine\nwas operating just above its cut-in wind speed. From the CWT\ntransformed values, the rms values of the power data corre-\nsponding to frequencies of 2sf1 and 2sf1\/p were calculated for\neach day, where available. Clearly, the turbine may not necessar-\nily have been operating in the low power range above cut-in on\nevery day. The 2sf1 component was quite small in magnitude\nand showed little change in magnitude throughout the 2-year\nperiod, however, the 2sf1\/p component was clearly visible and\ndid show changes in magnitude during the period. The results\nof this analysis for the 2sf1\/p frequency component are shown\nin Fig. 3. It can be seen from this figure that the daily rms\nWATSON et al.: CONDITION MONITORING OF THE POWER OUTPUT OF WIND TURBINE GENERATORS USING WAVELETS 719\nvalue showed an increase in November 2003. In January 2004,\na generator misalignment was noted by the operator and an at-\ntempt was made to correct this by other means. This attempt\nwas not successful and in March 2004, the generator bearing\nfailed. When the bearing was replaced, the wavelet rms values\nof the 2sf1\/p frequency component from the three phase power\noutput were reduced in magnitude, as shown in Fig. 3.\nMonitoring of the 2sf1\/p frequency by use of a CWT, there-\nfore, detected the generator shaft misalignment at least 3 months\nbefore the bearing failure occurred.\nA similar analysis was undertaken for a 2.5-MW-variable-\nspeed pitch-regulated wind turbine with a DFIG. In this case,\n30-Hz data were collected over the period of 1 year. In addition,\nvibration data from the gearbox and generator were collected.\nFig. 4(a) shows the daily rms CWT power amplitude corre-\nsponding to 2sf1\/p. In this case, the 2sf1 component could\nnot be monitored as it was outside the sampling frequency. For\ncomparison, Fig. 4(b) shows the band-filtered radial vibration\nvelocity values over the same period in the frequency range\n10\u201330 Hz from a vibration sensor placed on the generator cas-\ning near the drive-end bearing. This turbine was one of a group\nof five and increased generator drive-end bearing vibration had\nbeen reported on this turbine as compared with the other tur-\nbines. This was first picked up in December 2005. Around this\ntime, the CWT power amplitude shows an increase. During the\nperiod from 20th March to 24th April 2006, this vibration level\nincreased still further, as seen in Fig. 4(b). The CWT power\namplitude values also increased during this period, as seen in\nFig. 4(a). The increased vibration was found from inspection to\nbe due to shaft misalignment. Corrective maintenance was un-\ndertaken at the beginning of May 2006, and initially some small\nreduction in the vibration level and CWT power amplitude was\nnoted, but these levels started to increase again. At the beginning\nof July 2006, an attempt was made to realign the generator shaft\nonce again. However, high vibration levels were still present.\nIt was not until around September 2006 that the levels started\nto decrease slightly due either to the settling of the generator\nor to wear of the bearing. The CWT power amplitude values\nalso decreased slightly over this period. It should be noted that\nbearing failure had not occurred over this period, so it is unlikely\nthat such large increases in the CWT power amplitude would be\nseen, compared with the 1.5-MW wind turbine. Although, the\nreduction in the CWT and vibration signal levels would not in\nthemselves indicate possibly bearing problems, the time history\nof the levels in conjunction with the maintenance log would give\nthe necessary information assuming a complete failure modes\nand effects analysis (FMEA) had been carried out.\nAlthough the result of analyzing the power signal using the\nCWT is not as clear cut in the case of the 2.5 MW wind turbine,\nin terms of detecting shaft misalignment, there is nonetheless\nsufficient change in the CWT power amplitude over the monitor-\ning period, consistent with independent vibration monitoring, to\nconclude that DFIG rotor eccentricity due to misalignment has\nbeen detected by analysis of the 2sf1\/p frequency component.\nThe technique is certainly worthy of further investigation on a\nlarger number of similar wind turbines incorporating DFIG ma-\nchines. The technique could also be applied to fixed-speed wind\nFig. 4. (a) Daily root mean squared value of the CWT of the 2.5-MW wind\nturbine power output corresponding to a frequency of 2sf1\/p.

CONCLUSION\nThe move to offshore wind farms has highlighted the require-\nment for predictive and pro-active maintenance. One way to\ndo this is through intelligent condition monitoring. Bearing fail-\nures in gearboxes and generators can result in lengthy and costly\ndowntime. One way to monitor the health of such subassemblies\nis through relatively costly vibration monitoring. A lower cost\napproach, which may yield sufficient information for bearing\nhealth, is to monitor the wind turbine power output, already\navailable from the turbine control system.\nTraditional SCADA systems record data at 10-min intervals.\nAdditional logging at a modest frequency of \u223c30 Hz could be\nused in the future to measure mechanical modes of vibration\nin a turbine using accelerometers and strain gauges to allow\nadvanced control in order to reduce fatigue loads.\nIt has been shown, in this paper, that by monitoring the power\nat these modest frequencies and by applying a CWT to the\n720 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 25, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2010\nresulting data, the magnitude of the component at twice slip\nfrequency divided by pole pairs (2sf1\/p) may be tracked as an\nindicator of rotor eccentricity in a DFIG. Rotor eccentricity is\noften the result of increased bearing wear and an indication of\npotential failure. It is possible that other potential faults may give\nrise to an increase in the 2sf1\/p component and this warrants\nfurther mathematical and experimental investigation. Neverthe-\nless, it has been shown that rotor eccentricity may be detected\nusing this component.\nThe advantage of using a wavelet is that it can be used to\ntrack the 2sf1\/p frequency component under varying rotor fre-\nquency (slip), which is more problematic when using the more\ntraditional frequency Fourier transform. Another advantage of\nmonitoring the 2sf1\/p component is that it is generally at a low\nfrequency.\nAlthough the application of the CWT can be computationally\nexpensive, it is only the 2sf1\/p component that needs to be\ntracked in time and if this were done this would substantially\nreduce the required computational resources.\nThis technique described in this paper could be applied to any\nvariable-speed wind turbine using an induction generator and\nwould require only modest additional instrumentation over and\nabove the standard SCADA system.\nFurther work will be required to establish a full mathematical\nanalysis of the relationship between frequency components in\nthe current and power signal for both rotor winding asymmetry\nand eccentric rotors in induction machines. Future work is also\nrequired to apply this method to other operational wind turbines,\nwhich may be suffering from incipient generator bearing faults,\nand to use the detection of a faulty condition to potentially pre-\ndict failure some time in advance. The analysis presented in this\npaper has shown in a subjective way that shaft misalignment\nhas been detected, but further work is required to turn this tech-\nnique into a predictive tool where detection of potential bearing\nfailure is automated. This will require the analysis of a number\nof machines to establish thresholds for healthy and faulty ma-\nchines. Once sufficient data have been collected for a particular\ntype of machine, it would be possible to set appropriate alarm\nlevels, which would be automatically triggered. These levels\nwould alert operators to the possibility of bearing failure and\nthe requirement for proactive maintenance. Work is also nec-\nessary to assess whether this technique could be used to detect\ngearbox-bearing problems.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G. J. W. Van Bussel and C.
