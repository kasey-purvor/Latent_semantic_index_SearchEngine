Hayes,\n \nUniversity of Aberdeen\n \nIan McAllister,\n \nAustralian National University\n \nLizanne Dowds,\n \nUniversity of Ulster\n \nEducation is often seen as a means of achieving social change. Underlying this view is contact theory,\nwhich argues that increased contact between social groups will help reduce prejudicial attitudes and alleviate\nracial and ethnic divisions. This article tests and extends these propositions by examining the long-term impact of\nsegregated and integrated education on political identities and attitudes. Using a pooled sample of surveys con-\nducted on the adult population in Northern Ireland between 1998 and 2003, we address, for the first time, the\nquestion of whether or not experiencing a religiously integrated education has a significant effect on the political\noutlooks of Protestants and Catholics. The results suggest that attendance at a religiously integrated school\u2014\neither one formally constituted as integrated or a religious school incorporating a proportion from the opposite\nreligion\u2014has positive long-term benefits in promoting a less sectarian stance on national identity and constitu-\ntional preferences. The results also support recent research that has shown that the impact of contact on inter-\ngroup relations may not only vary significantly in terms of the nature of the contact situation but also in terms of\nthe societal status of the groups involved. We conclude that as the numbers experiencing integrated schooling\ngrows, these individuals have the potential to create a new common ground in Northern Ireland politics.\nKeywords: integrated education, social contact, intergroup relations, identity, Northern Ireland.\n \nEducation has traditionally been seen as an institution that reflects the social differences\nthat exist in society, and which are reproduced from generation to generation through social-\nization. A more recent view is that education has the capacity to create social change by iden-\ntifying the sources of conflict and developing policies to ameliorate them. This was the case in\nthe United States where the landmark decision of \n \nBrown v. Board of Education\n \n (1954) her-\nalded a new era in educational policy. Declaring racially segregated schools to be unconstitu-\ntional, the U.S. Supreme Court decision triggered a shift in the social role of education;\nschools came to be regarded as institutions with the potential to improve racial and ethnic\ngroup relations by diversifying students\u2019 social networks and thereby reducing prejudice (see\nZirkel and Cantor 2004). In addition to improving students\u2019 life chances, it was believed that\ninterracial contact would lead to a lessening of racist attitudes among whites and, ultimately,\nto more integration in other aspects of society (Brown v. Board of Education 1954:494).\nThese diverging views about the role of education also came into sharp relief in Northern\nIreland when the civil disturbances began in 1968, with the segregated school system becom-\ning a source of concern for many educators and community activists.

Early academic research also supported this view (see Dunn, Darby, and\nMullan 1991; Murray 1985). Highlighting the lack of contact between Protestant and Catho-\nlic schools, researchers identified the segregated educational system as a key contributory fac-\ntor in perpetuating the conflict, although there was a dearth of empirical evidence to either\nsupport or reject the hypothesis. Despite the passage of nearly four decades and numerous\npolicy initiatives, this lack of empirical investigation continues to this day, especially with\nregard to the long-term effects of integrated schooling (Abbott, Dunn, and Morgan 1998;\nMcGlynn 2003). \nThis article examines the impact of segregated and integrated education on political atti-\ntudes in Northern Ireland. More specifically, using contact theory as our frame of reference, we\naddress the question of whether or not integrated education has a long-term and significant\neffect on the identities and constitutional preferences of the adult population in Northern Ire-\nland. Although since first articulated by R. Williams (1947) and later refined by Gordon Allport\n(1954), contact theory has provided the focus for a plethora of studies in the United States and\nelsewhere on reducing racial and\/or ethnic prejudice and tensions within a society, to date its\ncontribution in terms of alleviating deeply-seated divisions in terms of national and political\ndivisions, as are evident in Northern Ireland, has not been systematically assessed. \nThe first part of this article outlines the educational system in Northern Ireland and eval-\nuates previous research findings concerning the relationship between integrated education\nand community relations between Protestants and Catholics within this society. Using contact\ntheory as our frame of reference, we then suggest a number of hypotheses as to the impact of\nintegrated education on political outlooks in Northern Ireland. Finally, we examine the\nnature and extent of integrated education among the adult population in Northern Ireland\nand investigate the consequences of exposure to the two differing educational systems\u2014inte-\ngrated versus segregated\u2014on political outlooks. More specifically, using a pooled sample of\nsurveys conducted on the adult population in Northern Ireland between 1998 and 2003\n(ARK 1998\u20132003), we address, for the first time, the question of whether or not experiencing\na religiously integrated education has a significant effect on the identity patterns and consti-\ntutional preferences of Protestants and Catholics within this society. \nAlthough educational segregation based on religion is not unique to Northern Ireland, it\nhas particular resonance there. Northern Ireland remains a deeply divided society; not only\nare Protestants and Catholics educated separately, but they are also segregated both residen-\ntially and in their workplaces, and display extremely low levels of religious mobility and\nintermarriage (Breen and Devine 1999; Breen and Hayes 1996; Hughes et al. 2006). Added to\nthis separation are social inequalities. Despite the passage of a series of anti-discrimination\nlaws since the late 1970s, Catholics remain, on average, less affluent than Protestants and are\nsubstantially more likely to be unemployed (see Russell 2004). \nHowever, more so than any other factor it is differences in identity patterns and territo-\nrial allegiances that divide the two communities within this society. Preferences on these two\nissues are polarized around two competing ethnonational identities: those who identify\nthemselves as British and wish to retain the union between Northern Ireland and Great Brit-\nain versus those who identify themselves as Irish and wish to see the two parts of the island\nof Ireland united. As John McGarry and Brendan O\u2019Leary (1995) put it: \u201cthe crucial endoge-\nnous cause of the conflict has been the presence of two competitive ethnonationalist commu-\nnities within the same territory\u201d (p. 356). The conflict is further heightened in that the\npolitical cleavage seems to coincide exactly with the religious division between Protestants\nand Catholics. Contemporary explanations of the conflict suggest that it is differences in these\nreligiously-based ethnonationalist identities\u2014British Protestants who wish Northern Ireland\nto remain part of the United Kingdom versus Irish Catholics who desire the reunification of\nthe island of Ireland\u2014which gives Northern Ireland politics its distinctive character and has\n \nSP5404_03  Page 455  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n 456\n \nHAYES\/M\n \nC\n \nALLISTER\/DOWDS\n \nresulted in the deaths of more than 3,000 people since 1969 (see Hayes and McAllister 2001;\nMcGarry and O\u2019Leary 1995).\nThis is not to deny, however, some important variation in national identity and constitu-\ntional preferences, particularly within the Catholic community. Although Protestant identity\npatterns and constitutional preferences have become increasingly homogeneous since the out-\nbreak of the current troubles in 1968,\n \n1\n \n Catholic identity patterns remain more divided.\n \n2\n \n Further-\nmore, there is some evidence to suggest that among those Protestants and Catholics who wish to\ndisavow traditional allegiances within their own communities, the most attractive and accept-\nable badge of identity is the more neutral \u201cNorthern Irish\u201d label.\n \n3\n \n However, for the vast majority\nof individuals, their religious and political identities remain coterminous. It is for this reason\u2014its\nconjunction with sociopolitical divisions within the wider society\u2014that educational segregation\non the basis of religious denomination remains a crucial issue in Northern Ireland (Dunn and\nMorgan 1991). In fact, for many people, their first contact with a member of the opposing reli-\ngious tradition and culture may not be until they attend university or enter the workforce.\n \nReligion and Education in Northern Ireland\n \nSince its foundation in 1921, Northern Ireland has had two separate, religiously based\neducational systems at both the primary and secondary level. The state (i.e., \u201ccontrolled\u201d)\nsystem is attended by Protestants, with a number of voluntary grammar schools also attended\npredominantly by Protestants.\n \n4\n \n Catholics attend schools that are all voluntary (as opposed to\nstate controlled) and, although also state financed, are operated by the Catholic Church and\ncommonly known as the maintained sector. This bipartite system long predates the present\n \n1. In 1968, just before the current phase of the troubles, less than two-fifths of Protestants identified themselves as\nBritish, a fifth saw themselves as Irish, and a third claimed an Ulster identity. After three decades of the troubles, Protes-\ntants had swung most definitely to adopting a British label: In 1989, with the introduction of a \u201cNorthern Irish\u201d identity as\na response category in survey questionnaires, 68 percent of Protestants claimed a British identity and only 3 percent an\nIrish one, with one in ten claiming an Ulster identity and 16 percent a Northern Irish one. Since then, Protestants have\nremained strongly committed to a British identity with almost eight out of every ten Protestants seeing themselves as Brit-\nish and about 15 percent claiming a Northern Irish identity. Protestants also remain strongly committed to retaining the\nunion with Britain; survey data suggests that around 90 percent of individuals have consistently supported this position\nthroughout the various survey years (see Fahey, Hayes, and Sinnott 2006). \n2. In 1968, 76 percent of Catholics identified themselves as Irish, a fifth saw themselves as British, and only 5 per-\ncent claimed an Ulster identity. By 1989, the number of Catholics choosing to describe themselves as either Irish or Brit-\nish had fallen in favor of a Northern Irish label; whereas 60 percent of Catholics identified themselves as Irish, 25\npercent identified themselves as Northern Irish, and only 8 percent as British, a pattern which continues to this day.\nCatholics also remain more divided than Protestants in terms of their territorial allegiances, with around two-thirds of\nindividuals supporting a united Ireland, about a fifth wishing to maintain the link with Britain, and one in ten support-\ning an independent Northern Ireland state (see Fahey et al. 2006). \n3. According to Moxon-Browne (1991), the attractiveness of this Northern Irish label may be explained by its ambi-\nguity. For Catholics, it does not legitimate political boundaries or compromise their aspirations as the term can refer to the\ngeographically northern part of the island of Ireland. Similarly, the Northern Irish identity does not compromise the British\nidentity of Protestants as the term can be seen as derived from Northern Ireland, an officially designated region of the\nUnited Kingdom. This is not the case, however, when an Ulster identity is considered, which despite its problematic geo-\ngraphical origins\u2014to ensure a Protestant majority, the formation of the Northern Ireland in 1921 was based on only six of\nthe nine countries of the historic province of Ulster\u2014has been the exclusive and traditional choice of the Protestant com-\nmunity and long associated with Protestant domination (see Ruane and Todd 1996). \n4. While all students attend primary schools from the age of five (sometimes a year earlier) through eleven, at the\nage of ten or eleven most students take a series of examinations (called the \u201cselection procedure\u201d or, popularly known\nas the Eleven Plus). Students who do well in the Eleven Plus enter grammar schools at the age of 11 or 12 where they\nreceive an academically-orientated education until the age of 18. Those who do not sit the examination or who do not\ndo well in the Eleven Plus typically attend secondary intermediate schools where the curriculum is also educational but\nneither expressively academic nor vocational. Achieving a good grade in the Eleven Plus does not constitute an educa-\ntional qualification in itself but enables a student to attend a grammar school. Attendance at grammar schools has\nalways been much higher for children from middle class backgrounds.\n \nSP5404_03  Page 456  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n Education and Political Identities in Northern Ireland\n \n457\n \nconstitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland. Prior to partition, most schools were owned\nby church authorities. The first Education Act passed by the new Northern Ireland parliament\nin 1923 attempted to replace church schools with a single, unified, nondenominational sys-\ntem. The Act, however, was vehemently rejected by all churches, Protestant and Catholic.\nChurch opposition to the proposed new system was so widespread that by 1930 the govern-\nment was forced to establish a \n \nde facto\n \n segregated education system, a situation that continues\nto this day.\n \n5\n \n \nGovernment statistics confirm the continuance of this religiously segregated education\nsystem (see DENI 2005). Based on the religious composition of school students in 2004\u20132005,\nthe data show that while 93 percent of Protestant children attend a controlled or state school,\nthe equivalent figure among Catholic children attending a Catholic-maintained school is 91\npercent. There is also a small minority of students (2.8 percent in 2004\u20132005) who cross the\nreligious divide and attend a segregated school different to their own religion, which may be\nconsidered a \u201creligiously mixed\u201d or informally integrated school. Furthermore, there is evi-\ndence to suggest that this crossover in attendance is more common among Catholics (4.4 per-\ncent in primary schools) than Protestants (1 percent in primary schools). The crossover is\nsmaller in secondary schools but more marked in grammar schools: 0.7 percent of students in\nCatholic grammar schools are Protestant but 8.3 percent of pupils in Protestant-controlled\ngrammar schools are Catholic. Thus, at least as far as the informally integrated educational\nsector is concerned, these schools are essentially Protestant schools with a minority of Catho-\nlic pupils in attendance.\nIn addition to their religious composition and management structure, the most obvious\ndifference between the two educational systems is the curriculum. For the most part, chil-\ndren take different subjects, learn different religions, read different books, and most impor-\ntantly, learn different histories (see Darby 1974; Darby et al. 1977; Magee 1970; Murray,\n1985). A. M. Gallagher (1995) studied the subjects taken by a sample of school students\nattending different grammar schools. He found that the largest differences were in culturally\nspecific subjects, with more Catholics taking religious education than Protestants, and Protes-\ntant students being more numerous than Catholics across most of the science subjects, nota-\nbly biology and mathematics. There was also evidence to suggest that even when religious\neducation was conducted, there was little attempt to deal with \u201cthe problems of comparative\nreligion which lies at the root of so many problems in Northern Ireland, the Protestant-Catholic\ndivision\u201d (Greer quoted in Gallagher 1995:26).\nMore than religious education, however, is the differences encountered in the teaching\nof history in Protestant and Catholic schools (Gallagher 2003:65\u201366). For decades Catholic\nchildren were taught Irish history, often with overtly political overtones. In many history\nbooks there was an obsession with the Anglo-Irish conflict and Sean Farren (1976) found in\nsome a \u201cjustification for the nationalist cause in terms that could often be accused of bias and\nof a lack of proper historical perspective\u201d (p. 29). By contrast, Protestant children were rarely\ntaught about Irish history, except when it related to British history. While many of these\nbiases have been addressed since the 1970s, most notably through the introduction of a com-\nmon (though voluntary) curriculum in 1990,\n \n6\n \n it still remains the case that a Catholic is likely\nto study more Irish history than a Protestant, and a Protestant will study more British history\nthan a Catholic. \n \n5. Crucial components of the 1930 Education Act were the management of voluntary schools, which was broad-\nened to include the clergy and their funding, half of which now came from the state. This discrepancy in funding was\npartially removed in 1968 but it was not until the early 1990s that the discrepancy in capital funding was finally elimi-\nnated (see McGrath 2000, for a detailed and historical discussion of this issue).\n6. This is not to deny, however, the continuing importance of the \u201cschool ethos\u201d or differences in relation to the\n\u201chidden curriculum.\u201d For example, it is still the case that whereas assemblies in Protestant schools often involve singing\ntraditional Protestant hymns and wreaths are laid in Remembrance Day services, Catholic schools concentrate on Irish\nhistorical commemorations (such as Saint Patrick\u2019s Day) and Catholic religious rituals. \n \nSP5404_03  Page 457  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n 458\n \nHAYES\/M\n \nC\n \nALLISTER\/DOWDS\n \nA distinctively different picture emerges when the integrated educational sector is con-\nsidered. In fact, contrary to their religiously segregated counterparts, the overarching goal of\nintegrated schools is to foster an understanding of both the dominant traditions and to over-\ncome negative stereotypes (see NICIE 2004a, 2004b). Attended in roughly equal numbers by\nProtestant and Catholic children, integrated schools are defined by the government as schools\nthat have a 30 percent minimum enrolment from whichever side of the community forms a\nminority within that school. By educating children from both religious communities together\nand encouraging them to understand their historical and religious differences, both parents\nand educators hope that children educated within a religiously integrated setting will feel less\nthreatened by the cultures and traditions of the other community, and be more likely to\nrespect them, as well as form enduring cross-community relations. In the most contentious\narea, religious education, integrated schools provide interdenominational religious education\nrequired by the parents. In the other area of contention, the teaching of history, the inte-\ngrated curriculum emphasizes local history in order to try and create a common heritage.\nImportantly, no single model of integration unites Northern Ireland\u2019s integrated schools\nand they vary considerably with regard to how actively they promote integration (see Mont-\ngomery et al. 2003). Furthermore, not all staff in integrated schools have been equally proac-\ntive in achieving an integrationist ethos. In a recent study, Caitlin Donnelly (2004a, 2004b)\nfound considerable disparity among teachers with regard to how an ethos of tolerance and\nrespect could be created and maintained in the school. Donnelly and Joanne Hughes (2006)\nsupported these findings and found that not only was there considerable disparity among\nparents, teachers, and principals as to what constituted an integrated ethos but discussions\nwith pupils concerning politically contentious issues were deliberatively avoided. However,\nmore so than any other factor, the key difference between integrated and segregated schools\nis their commitment to constitutional and structural safeguards to encourage joint ownership\nby the two traditions (Smith 2001).\n \n7\n \nOne explanation for these patterns is the relative newness of integrated schooling in\nNorthern Ireland. It was not until 1981 and against vitriolic objections from church leaders in\nboth communities that the first integrated school, Lagan College, was established by parents\n(see O\u2019Connor 2002 for a detailed historical account of this issue). So great was opposition to\nits establishment that it was originally funded from private sources, finally achieving govern-\nment funding in 1984. Since then, between two and three new integrated schools a year\nhave opened, all established either by grassroots initiative or through a parental ballot to give\nan existing school integrated status. By 2005 there were 58 schools at both the primary and\npost-primary level with a total enrolment of 16,691 pupils, accounting for 5.3 percent of the\nstudent population (see NICIE 2005:34). Of these 58 schools, the vast majority\u201439 schools\u2014\nare primary schools as compared to just 19 secondary schools. There are no formally inte-\ngrated grammar schools. As a consequence of parental initiatives and the subsequent\nachievement in government funding, the integrated education sector has flourished since\n1989.\n \n8\n \n \nWhile the growth of integrated schools is remarkable, it has also generated tension and\nconflict (see Dunn and Morgan 1999), particularly since the mid-1990s, when government\nattempts to restrict educational expenditure discouraged further integration. Although the\ntransformation of existing schools to integrated status was legally conceded as far back as the\nlate 1970s (Education NI Act 1977), to date only a dozen schools have embarked on this\n \n7. For example, all integrated schools have adopted the principle that both students and staff should be drawn\nfrom both cultural traditions and it is not unusual for parents from both religious communities to constitute roughly half\nof the governing body in integrated schools.\n8. In 2004\u20132005, 3.9 percent of primary schoolchildren attended integrated schools, compared to 2.4 percent in\n1998\u20131999; similarly, 11.4 percent of children in secondary schools attended integrated schools in 2004\u20132005, compared\nto 5.7 percent in 1998\u20131999 (see the NICIE website at www.nicie.org\/ for additional statistical information).\n \nSP5404_03  Page 458  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n Education and Political Identities in Northern Ireland\n \n459\n \nroute, all of which have been preexisting (Protestant) state controlled schools (see Smith\n2001:571). And, while some have welcomed their establishment, supporters of integration\nhave either rejected this approach as unworkable or have expressed concerns about many\naspects of the process. These concerns have covered issues such as the proportion of cross-\ncommunity enrolment necessary, or the achievement of a balanced staff (see Morgan and\nFraser 1999). Despite their objections, however, government policy coupled with falling stu-\ndent numbers suggests that this trend towards the transformation of existing schools to an\nintegrated status will accelerate (see \n \nA Shared Future\n \n [OFMDFM 2005]). \nIn summary, the key characteristic of education in Northern Ireland is the existence of\ntwo parallel\u2014Protestant-controlled and Catholic-maintained\u2014religiously based school sys-\ntems, catering for Protestant and Catholic students separately. In recent years, this monolithic\nsystem has shown some signs of erosion. Currently, there is a small, but growing, integrated\neducational sector, accounting for just over 5 percent of the school population and attracting\nstudents not only from both religious traditions but from all socioeconomic backgrounds (see\nGallagher, Smith, and Montgomery 2003).\n \n9\n \n The introduction and development of this third\nelement in the educational system\u2014integrated schools\u2014was based on the assumption that\ncontact between divided groups within an educational setting can reduce sectarian attitudes\nand lead to better intergroup relations. Yet, as will be argued in the next section, empirical\nresearch in Northern Ireland remains both inconclusive and divided in terms of the impact of\nintegrated education in reducing intergroup conflict and division within this society.\n \nDoes Integrated Education Work?\n \nPrevious empirical research on the relationship between integrated schools and relations\nbetween Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland is both limited and inconclusive (see\nMcGlynn et al. 2004 for a review). Although several studies stress the positive benefits of\nintegrated schooling, particularly in promoting cross-community friendships, others are more\nambiguous, suggesting that it has little or no impact in promoting shared cultural outlooks.\nSome commentators even suggest that integrated education may actually reinforce divisive\nethnic and political views. \nThe first major investigation of this issue by Colin Irwin (1991) found an increase in the\nnumber and duration of intercommunity friendships among pupils enrolled in an integrated\nschool. Based on an evaluation of the friendship choices of Protestant and Catholic pupils, he\nfound that after just five years of secondary education in an integrated school not only did\npupils who had attended a segregated primary school have more friends from the \u201cother\u201d\ncommunity than their own but, contrary to earlier research on short-term cross-community\ncontact projects (see Trew 1986), these friendships continued into adulthood. Later research\n \n9. Using the proportion of pupils in a school who were entitled to free school meals as an indictor of socioeconomic\nbackground, not only did Gallagher and colleagues (2003) find notably higher levels of social disadvantage in integrated\nschools as compared with grammar schools but there was little difference in the level of social disadvantage between inte-\ngrated schools and their Protestant counterparts in both the primary and secondary sector. For example, whereas between\n21 to 25 percent of students in integrated secondary schools were entitled to free school meals in 2001\u20132002, the equiva-\nlent figure among Protestant schools was almost identical at 24 percent. Overall, however, the highest level of social disad-\nvantage was found in Catholic schools and this was true across all three\u2014primary, secondary, and grammar\u2014sectors. As\nGallagher and colleagues (2003), in summarising their findings in relation to the popularist belief that children in inte-\ngrated schools are exclusively drawn from middle class backgrounds, conclude: \u201cThe evidence suggests that the claim that\nintegrated schools merely represent middle class alternatives to grammar schools is not supported by the evidence\u201d (p. 17).\nLater research by McGlynn (2003) lends further support to this finding. In a follow-up study of 159 former pupils from\ntwo long-established integrated schools in Northern Ireland, not only did this study find that students had been drawn in\nsignificant numbers from both religious traditions but they also came from a wide variety of socioeconomic backgrounds.\nAs McGlynn (2003), in rejecting the claim that integrated schools are schools for children of liberal and nonconformist\nmiddle class intellectuals, briefly concludes: \u201cWhilst some of the \u2018founder\u2019 parents of School A might fit this stereotype,\nsubsequent parents from both schools represent a wide social mix\u201d (p. 20).\n \nSP5404_03  Page 459  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n 460\n \nHAYES\/M\n \nC\n \nALLISTER\/DOWDS\n \nhas confirmed these findings. Maurice Stringer and associates (2000) compared 1,732 pupils\nfrom integrated and nonintegrated schools and found that pupils in integrated schools\nreported higher levels of social contact with members of the \u201cother\u201d community than chil-\ndren in segregated schools, and took a liberal position on mixed marriage and integrated edu-\ncation. There is also evidence to suggest that the integrationist attitudes formed during this\nperiod persist long after the school experience, even extending to the choice of a cohabitating\nor marital partner (McGlynn 2003; see also McGlynn et al. 2004).\n \n10\n \n \nAlthough research suggests the positive influence of integrated schooling on community\nattitudes, the evidence in relation to its impact on religious and political identities is less con-\nclusive. Although Carol McClenahan and colleagues (1996) found that cross-community\nfriendships were increased by intergroup contact, they failed to detect any change in national\nor sociopolitical identity as a result of coeducation. Later research by Claire McGlynn (2003)\non the adult population lends further support to these findings. Although the study found\nthat the overwhelming majority (93 percent) of past pupils felt that integrated education had\na significant positive impact on their lives, religious identity was unaffected and there was\nalso little impact on political identity. In fact, in a small minority of cases, self-perceptions of\nreligious and ethnic identity had been strengthened, rather than diminished, as a result of\nintegrated education. \nResearch on the effects of desegregation on both the student and adult population in the\nUnited States confirms these findings (see Holme, Wells, and Revilla 2005; Schofield 1995;\nWells and Crain 1994; Wells et al. 2005). Although a review of earlier research on the school\npopulation suggested that the impact of desegregated education on intergroup relations was\nboth \u201cinconclusive and inconsistent\u201d (see Schofield 1995:611), later survey-based research\nhas underscored the significance of desegregation in shaping the racial attitudes and experi-\nences of students. Pointing to the positive effects of desegregation on racial attitudes, these\nlater studies show that attending a racially integrated school significantly improves inter-\ngroup relations and increases students\u2019 ability to operate effectively in interracial settings.\nMinority students who had attended desegregated schools were also more likely to attend\nand succeed in college and to work in interracial settings (see The Civil Rights Project 2002;\nEaton 2001; Wells and Crain 1994). The only comprehensive study of the long-term impact\nof school desegregation on the adult population reached similar conclusions (see Holme et al.\n2005; Wells et al. 2005). \nAn important caveat to these U.S. studies on the long-term impact of school desegrega-\ntion is that they are based on \u201chindsight\u201d lessons, which participants only became aware of as\nadults. In fact, it was not until \n \nafter\n \n they had left school and attended college or entered the\nworkplace did these graduates realize what they had learned and the benefits of their experi-\nences vis-\u00e0-vis their peers who had not attended diverse schools. Paradoxically, the vast\nmajority of these graduates and their children had currently little or no contact with individ-\nuals of another racial group and were highly segregated in terms of housing, employment,\nsocial interaction, and religious observance. As Jennifer Jellison Holme, Amy Stuart Wells\nand Anita Tijerina Revilla (2005), in assessing the long-term impact of desegregated educa-\ntion on the U.S. population, conclude: \n \nAlthough our data show that these graduates had not changed the world\u2014in fact most have (often\nunwittingly) done their part as adults to perpetuate our segregated society\u2014our findings do suggest\nthat the experience of attending racially diverse schools may break down the cycle of segregation by\ngiving them increased comfort in racially mixed settings, and decreased fear of racially mixed envi-\nronments (p. 23).\n \n10. McGlynn (2003) found strong integrationist views among her adult sample and in many cases these views\nalso extended to the choice of partners, with more than half of the past pupils having a partner from a different religious\nand cultural background, compared to about 10 percent of the adult population (NILT 2003). A key factor contributing\nto this outcome was the school environment and not parental influence (McGlynn 2003:20\u201321).\n \nSP5404_03  Page 460  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n Education and Political Identities in Northern Ireland\n \n461\n \nIn summary, then, while there is a growing body of national and cross-national evidence\nto suggest that integrated schooling or coeducation has a significant and positive influence on\nthe lives of those who experience it, most notably in terms of reducing prejudicial attitudes as\nwell as promoting a sense of security in religious, racial, or ethnically diverse environments,\nprevious research as to its impact on sociopolitical attitudes remains both rare and inconclu-\nsive. This is particularly the case in the United States where the impact of coeducation on\nidentity patterns has not been previously assessed. Furthermore, at least as far as ethnic or\nreligious identity in Northern Ireland is concerned, there is evidence to suggest that inte-\ngrated education, or regular contact between the two main religious communities in a formal\neducational setting, may, in fact, have the opposite effect in reinforcing such allegiances. It is\nto a theoretical discussion of this issue\u2014the impact of intergroup contact in alleviating con-\nflict and division\u2014to which we now turn. \n \nThe Theoretical Framework\n \nThe Contact Hypothesis\n \nOne of the most frequently applied approaches to conflict resolution is the contact\nhypothesis, and in Northern Ireland it has been widely endorsed by both the government and\nthe academic community (see Gallagher 2003; Hughes 2003; Niens, Cairns, and Hewstone\n2003). The idea that integrated contexts provide the best means of fostering reconciliation was\nfirst advanced in the 1940s by Williams (1947) and elaborated on by Allport (1954). In its sim-\nplest form, the contact hypothesis proposes that intergroup conflict can be reduced by bring-\ning together individuals from opposing groups. One of the underlying assumptions is that\nconflict arises from lack of information about the other group and from lack of opportunities\nto obtain such information. Thus, according to the contact hypothesis, one of the most pro-\nductive ways to reduce intergroup conflict and division is to encourage and promote contact\nbetween members of different racial and\/or ethnic groups, resulting in more tolerant and\npositive attitudes. For this to happen, Allport (1954) suggested that four core conditions need\nto be met: (1) equal status between the groups in the situation; (2) common goals; (3) no\ncompetition between groups; and (4) the contact situation should be legitimized through\ninstitutional support. \nSince it was first proposed by Allport (1954) over fifty years ago, the intergroup contact\nhypothesis has been extensively tested. Most of the research has compared the attitudes of\nparticipants before and after intergroup contact, in an attempt to determine if contact is\nindeed effective in improving intergroup relations (see Pettigrew 1998). Findings have, in\ngeneral, indicated that even in situations lacking Allport\u2019s key conditions, intergroup contact\nusually has positive effects.\n \n11\n \n For example, Thomas Pettigrew and Linda Tropp (2000), in an\nextensive review of the literature, not only found that intergroup contact significantly\nreduced ethnic and racial conflict but concluded that optimal intergroup contact, such as\nstructured programs that ensure that all or most of Allport\u2019s four core conditions are met, was\na key aspect of any successful effort to reduce prejudice. In fact, according to Pettigrew\n(1998), provided a number of interrelated and sequential process are achieved under these\noptimal conditions, not only may intergroup contact mediate positive attitudinal change and\nreduce intergroup conflict but it can also result in the development of an overarching identity\n \n11. This is not to suggest, however, that contact theory has been immune to criticism. For example, a key problem as\nAllport himself acknowledged, is that the causal direction between contact and the reduced intergroup conflict may be\nequivocal. More recent research suggests that the issue of causal direction may not be as problematic as originally antici-\npated. Indeed, longitudinal, experimental, and meta-analytic studies all provide converging evidence that intergroup con-\ntact can contribute to reducing prejudice (see Pettigrew and Tropp 2006; Tropp and Pettigrew 2005). \n \nSP5404_03  Page 461  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n 462\n \nHAYES\/M\n \nC\n \nALLISTER\/DOWDS\n \nin which participants perceive themselves as sharing a common or singular identity with out-\ngroup members.\n \n12\n \n \nMore recent research suggests that, even when all of Allport\u2019s optimal conditions have\nbeen met, problems can still arise that can militate against positive attitudinal change and\nheighten intergroup conflict. For example, as Tropp and Pettigrew\u2019s (2005) investigation of\nintergroup contact and prejudice among minority and majority status groups suggests, even\nin situations under optimal conditions, majorities and minorities can perceive the same\nobjective situation in contrasting and conflicting ways. Thus, what may appear as equal\ngroup status in the contact situation to majority members may appear to minority members\nas potentially threatening and unequal. This mitigation against attitudinal change and the\nreinforcement of conflict seems to occur particularly in interracial or multiethnic contexts\nwhere groups are more marginally imbalanced in size. This is in contrast to situations where\nthere is a numerical majority dominating the smaller group. Furthermore, there is some evi-\ndence to suggest that, even in situations under optimal conditions, contact appears to have a\nstronger impact on the attitudes of high-status majority groups rather than on low-status\nminority groups, and this is particularly the case when contact between different racial or\nethnic groups are considered. For example, Tropp and Pettigrew (2005), using data from a\nlarger meta-analysis of some 500 studies involving contact among groups of differing status\npositions within society, not only found that the contact-prejudice effects varied significantly\nin terms of the societal status of the groups involved but this was also the case even when\nAllport\u2019s four conditions were met. More specifically, whereas intergroup contact under these\ncircumstances was a significant factor in reducing prejudice among majority status group\nmembers, the relationship between intergroup contact and a reduction in prejudice was\nmuch weaker among members of low status groups (see Tropp and Pettigrew 2005 for a com-\nprehensive discussion of this issue). \nAn empirical examination of the impact of the educational system on political attitudes\nin Northern Ireland may be considered an appropriate case study for investigating the impact\nof contact theory on reducing intergroup conflict. Our arguments in support of this proposi-\ntion are threefold. First, previous research in the United States and elsewhere attests to the\nimportance of desegregated schools in alleviating racial and ethnic conflict even under situa-\ntions where all of Allport\u2019s conditions\u2014such as involuntary attendance or a competitive\natmosphere\u2014have not been met (see Pettigrew 1998:68). In fact, despite a perceived lack in\noptimal conditions, more recent research suggests the interracial contact at school is a more\neffective mechanism in disconfirming racial and ethnic stereotypes than contact in other\ninteractive settings such as one\u2019s community of residence or place of work. For example,\nDixon and Rosenbaum (2004), in a recent empirical investigation on the effects of whites\u2019\ncontacts with blacks and Hispanics in different interactive settings, found that prior contact in\na school environment was the primary factor in reducing racial prejudice. In other words, it\nwas contact in the school and not in other interactive settings such as one\u2019s current commu-\nnity of residence, workplace, or even family contact, which emerged as the key and consistent\nfactor in ameliorating anti-black and anti-Hispanic stereotypes among whites in this instance.\nSecond, unlike many of their desegregated U.S. counterparts, at least in principal, inte-\ngrated schools in Northern Ireland explicitly aim to fulfil all of Allport\u2019s optimal conditions in\nreducing intergroup conflict. As noted earlier, not only do integrated schools seek to actively\nand explicitly promote cooperation and shared cultural understanding among students across\ndenominational lines but through their recruitment practices and management structure\nthey also aim to promote equal-status roles for students (and parents) from both religious\n \n12. These four interrelated and sequential processes include learning about the out-group, changing behavior,\ngenerating affective ties, and in-group appraisal. In other words, according to Pettigrew (1998), to achieve a maximum\nreduction in prejudice, first people should get to know each other as friends, that they should then understand that they\ncome from two opposing groups, and finally that an attempt should be made to forge a common identity. \n \nSP5404_03  Page 462  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n Education and Political Identities in Northern Ireland\n \n463\n \ntraditions. One key difference between integrated and segregated schools in Northern Ireland\nis their commitment to constitutional and structural safeguards to encourage joint ownership\nby the two traditions. By encouraging children to understand their historical and religious\ndifferences, integrated schools not only attempt to foster a social climate that supports inter-\nreligious cooperation and association, as modelled by authority figures such as teachers and\nprincipals, but also to provide opportunities for Protestant and Catholic children to work and\nlearn cooperatively together to achieve common goals, namely the creation of a common\nheritage based on local history. Thus, in principle at least, if not always in practice, integrated\nschools may be considered to meet most of Allport\u2019s optimal conditions. \nThird, Northern Ireland remains a deeply segregated and polarized society. Not only are\nthe two main religious communities\u2014Protestant and Catholic\u2014segregated in terms of their\nschooling patterns, but this division extends into all areas of social life. So great is the level of\npolarization and the deliberate avoidance of any interaction with the other religious commu-\nnity, that for many people they will have little or no contact with a member of the opposing\nreligious tradition prior to attending university or entering the workforce. It is for this rea-\nson\u2014the absence of any contact between the two religious communities except in a school\nsetting\u2014that the use of contact theory as our guiding theoretical framework may be consid-\nered particularly appropriate in this instance.\nThis is not to deny the possibility of other mechanisms, most notably the school envi-\nronment and its associated curriculum, in influencing political outlooks in this instance.\nThe educational system in Northern Ireland still remains sharply divided along religious\nlines and this is particularly the case when the cultural ethos within the school, or the\nschool environment, is considered. Despite recent changes, most notably the introduction\nof a common curriculum in 1990, children within these religiously divided schools are\nnot only taught by teachers drawn exclusively from their own tradition but they also\ncontinue to celebrate different events and holidays and, more importantly, follow two\ndifferent curriculum\u2014a pro-British one in both informally integrated and state schools,\nboth of which are essentially Protestant schools, as compared to a more Irish-centered one\nin Catholic schools. Critics of the existing system believe that the educational experience\nof schoolchildren in Northern Ireland is so partisan in nature that to address the problem\nof prejudice and sectarianism not only would both school systems\u2014informally integrated\nand segregated\u2014have to develop a new ethos and character but they could only do so by\nabandoning their existing one. \nSimilar concerns have also been raised about the school ethos and curriculum content in\nformally integrated schools. And, while formally integrated schools have sought to address\nexplicitly this issue via the development of new curriculums and pedagogies, there is some\nevidence to suggest that this aspect of the school is being seriously undermined, in part due to\nthe turnover of staff and the limited specific training for teachers wishing to work in inte-\ngrated settings but particularly because of their overconcentration on contact work (see Gal-\nlagher 2004 for a discussion of this issue). Some scholars go so far as to suggest that this\noveremphasis on contact in integrated schools, as opposed to curricular work, which has\ntended to be given a relatively low priority, has seriously hampered efforts to provide a genu-\ninely integrated environment. Added to which, the \u201csocial grammar\u201d that exists in Northern\nIreland, whereby people, to avoid causing discomfort and offence, do not talk about issues of\npolitics in religiously mixed company is also evident in integrated schools. As Tony Gallagher\n(2004) notes, this unwritten social rule means that people can engage in cross-community\ncontact while remaining largely ignorant of the views of members of the \u201cother\u201d community\non fundamental social divisions within society. It is these two alternative factors\u2014the partic-\nular school ethos as well as the specific content of the curriculum\u2014and not the nature or\nlevel of intergroup contact, which may account for differences in political outlooks in this\ninstance. Unfortunately, however, because of a lack of suitable data we are unable to test\nempirically this competing explanation here. \n \nSP5404_03  Page 463  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n 464\n \nHAYES\/M\n \nC\n \nALLISTER\/DOWDS\n \nHypotheses\n \nUsing the contact hypothesis as our theoretical framework, this study examines the\nimpact of integrated education on adult attitudes in Northern Ireland. More specifically, we\ninvestigate the degree to which individuals from the two main religious communities who\nattended either a formally or informally integrated school differ in their political outlooks\nfrom those who attended a religiously segregated one. Northern Ireland remains a deeply\ndivided society and this is particularly the case when the question of national identity and\nconstitutional preferences are concerned. In fact, so pervasive and deeply-rooted are these\ndivisions in identity and territorial allegiances between the two religious communities that\nnot only have children as young as six years of age already acquired a negative evaluation of\nmembers of the opposite religion but by the age of 10 and 11 they are able to clearly distin-\nguish in-group and out-group members (see Hayes and McAllister 1999b for a review of this\nliterature). \nThe relationship between intergroup contact within a religiously mixed educational set-\nting and a less sectarian or traditionally entrenched and divisive outlook in political attitudes\nis our central hypothesis. Individuals attending a formally or informally integrated school\nwill, therefore, be less sectarian in their outlooks compared to an individual who has\nattended a segregated school (Hypothesis 1), but the more recent theoretical literature also\nprompts us to investigate this relationship in greater detail. We argued earlier that the rela-\ntionship between contact and a reduction in intergroup prejudice is strongest when Allports\u2019s\nfour conditions are met. We thus hypothesize that less sectarian attitudes in relation to\nnational identity and constitutional preferences will be strongest among adults who attended\na formally integrated school as compared to those who attended an informally integrated one\n(Hypothesis 2). Drawing on Pettigrew\u2019s (1998) suggestion of the possibility of a singular iden-\ntity, we also hypothesize that individuals who have attended these formally or informally\nintegrated schools will be the most likely to have developed an overarching in-group identity\nor, in this case, one that is distinctive from the two competing and traditionally established\nidentity preferences and constitutional allegiances (Hypothesis 3).\n \n13\n \nThe final hypotheses take into account Tropp and Pettigrew\u2019s (2005) work in relation\nto majority-minority relations. We hypothesize that, even in situations where Allport\u2019s four\nconditions are more likely to be met, such as among individuals who had attended a for-\nmally integrated school, a reduction in divisive political outlooks will be more likely among\nhigh-status individuals than low-status group members, or in this case more among Protes-\ntants than Catholics (Hypothesis 4). However, in situations where Allports\u2019s four conditions\nare absent, such as individuals who have been in a clear minority position at school (those\nwho cross the religious divide and attended a segregated school different to their own), we\nanticipate that it will be members of minority groups, or Catholics in this instance, who will\nbe not only more likely to move away from their traditional political allegiances but also to\naccommodate and possibly adopt the attitudes of their majority (Protestant) colleagues\n(Hypothesis 5).\nOne caveat surrounding this investigation is the difficulty in assigning causality. Since\nour analysis is based on aggregated cross-sectional surveys, we do not know the outlooks of\nthe respondents or their parents before they entered an integrated school. For example, it\ncould be argued that more liberally-minded parents are more likely to send their children to\nintegrated schools, and that any effects we attribute to schooling may in fact be due to selec-\ntivity among parents. Research in both the United States and Northern Ireland casts doubt\nupon this interpretation (see Hewstone 2003; McGlynn 2003; Pettigrew 1997; Tropp and\nPettigrew 2005). Our arguments in support of this position are threefold. \n \n13. This is not to deny, however, our lack of knowledge as to the specific mechanisms and the sequencing of\nevents by which these individuals were exposed to an integrationalist ethos within their various integrated schools.\n \nSP5404_03  Page 464  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n Education and Political Identities in Northern Ireland\n \n465\n \nFirst, previous experimental research in the United States demonstrates that contact can\nand does affect attitudes (Cook 1978). Second, we know from analyses that have estimated\nthe causal effects from cross-sectional data that the path from contact to attitudes tends to be\nstronger than the reciprocal path (Pettigrew 1997). There is now a growing and converging\nbody of studies\u2014longitudinal, experimental, and meta-analytic\u2014to suggest that intergroup\ncontact can lead to a reduction in prejudice (see Tropp and Pettigrew 2005:951). Third, at\nleast as far as Northern Ireland is concerned, there is empirical evidence to suggest that con-\ntact between the two religious communities in an integrated educational setting also affects\nattitudes. Previous research demonstrates that not only are pupils in integrated schools in\nNorthern Ireland drawn from a variety of social backgrounds but they attract children who\nhad little or no contact with the \u201cother side\u201d prior to integrated schooling, suggesting that it is\nthe school environment and not parental influence which determines their attitudes (see\nMcGlynn 2003:11\u201328).\n \n14\n \n \n \nMethods\n \nData\n \nThe data used in the analysis are based on a pooled sample of the 1998 to 2003 Northern\nIreland Life and Times Surveys (ARK 1998\u20132003) and the 1998 and 2003 Northern Ireland\nElection Surveys (ARK 1998, 2003). The 1998 through 2003 Northern Ireland Life and Times\nSurveys are nationally representative surveys of the Northern Ireland population conducted\nin the autumn of each year, based on a random sample of the adult population aged 18 years\nor over. The 1998 Referendum and Election Survey was a nationally representative post-\nelection survey of all adults aged 18 years or older conducted immediately after the Northern\nIreland assembly elections in June 1998, while the 2003 Northern Ireland Election Study was\na nationally representative post-election survey of all adults aged 18 years or older conducted\nimmediately after the Northern Ireland assembly elections in November 2003. All of the sur-\nveys are based on personal interviews. Given our research question of interest, only individu-\nals who explicitly identified themselves as members of the two main religious communities\u2014\nProtestant and Catholic\u2014are included in the investigation. This accounted for 11,522 individ-\nuals, or 88.5 percent of the total pooled sample and 99.7 percent of those who explicitly\nclaimed a religious affiliation. \n \nMeasurement\n \nDependent Variables.\n \nThe two dependent variables are identity and constitutional prefer-\nences, which reflect the main communal divisions in Northern Ireland. Two dimensions of\nidentity are investigated in the analysis. The first is \n \nnational identity\n \n, which was operational-\nized by the question: \u201cWhich of these describes best the way you think of yourself?,\u201d with the\nresponse options British, Irish, Ulster, Northern Irish, or other. The second aspect of identity\nis \n \npolitical identity\n \n, which was operationalized by the question: \u201cGenerally speaking, do you\nthink of yourself as a unionist, a nationalist, or neither?\u201d Responses to these two questions\nhave also been combined to create a \u201ccongruency in identity\u201d variable, measured by the\ndegree to which Protestants perceive themselves as \n \nboth\n \n British and Unionist versus those\nwho do not and the number of Catholic respondents who see themselves as \n \nboth\n \n Irish and\n \n14. This is an issue, however, that can only be comprehensively resolved by extensive, long-term panel\nstudies.\n \nSP5404_03  Page 465  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n 466\n \nHAYES\/M\n \nC\n \nALLISTER\/DOWDS\n \nNationalist versus those who do not.\n \n15\n \n Constitutional preference was operationalized by the\nquestion: \u201cDo you think that the long-term policy for Northern Ireland should be for it to\nremain part of the United Kingdom or to reunify with Ireland?,\u201d with the response categories\nto remain part of the United Kingdom or to reunify with the rest of Ireland.\n \n16\n \n \n \nIndependent Variables.\n \nOur main independent variable is \n \ntype of education\n \n, measured by the\nquestion: \u201cDid you ever attend a mixed school or integrated school in Northern Ireland, that is, a\nschool with fairly large numbers of \n \nboth\n \n Catholic \n \nand\n \n Protestant children?\u201d The response catego-\nries were yes or no. Individuals who said \u201cyes\u201d were asked: \u201cWas this a \n \nformally\n \n integrated school\nor was it a school that was just fairly mixed?\u201d Using these two questions, three groups are distin-\nguished in the analysis: individuals who reported attending an integrated school that was a for-\nmally integrated school; individuals who reported attending an integrated school that was just\nfairly mixed; and individuals who said that they had not attended either a mixed school or inte-\ngrated school in Northern Ireland, or respondents who answered no to question one.\nAn important limitation is that we do not know on what numerical basis the respondents\nevaluated the religious composition of these schools. While it could be argued that this measure\nhas limited utility, it does have value in identifying the proportion of the population who had\nsome experience of meeting children of the opposite religion at school, albeit not in a formally\nintegrated context. Also, as we noted earlier, because Catholic children are more likely than\nProtestant children to cross the religious divide and attend a segregated school different to their\nown religion, we can correctly assume that the vast majority of these informally integrated, or\njust fairly mixed, schools are, in fact, Protestant schools with a significant Catholic minority. \n \nControl Variables.\n \nWe also include several other measures as controls in the multivariate\nmodels, given previous research as to their significant association with identity patterns and con-\nstitutional preferences in Northern Ireland (see Fahey et al. 2006 for a recent overview of this lit-\nerature). These variables are \n \ngender\n \n, \n \nchurch attendance\n \n, \n \nage\n \n, \n \neducation\n \n,\n \n17\n \n \n \noccupation\n \n, and \n \nemployment\nstatus\n \n and are described in Table 1.\n \n18\n \n Protestants are generally older (50.1 years) than Catholics\n(45.8 years), reflecting the higher levels of fertility among Catholics. They are also more likely\nthan Catholics to be employed and to work in nonmanual occupations and are significantly less\nlikely to lack any educational qualifications, a not unexpected finding given their traditionally\nestablished economically privileged position within Northern Ireland society. Catholics, by con-\ntrast, are more likely to attend church on a regular basis than Protestants and, as expected, are\nnotably less likely than their Protestant counterparts to come from Protestant homes.\n \nAnalysis\n \nIn order to assess the impact of type of school on political preferences, a series of bivari-\nate and multivariate analyses were undertaken. Our analytic strategy was to compare the\nopinions not only of Protestants and Catholics in relation to this issue but also to distinguish\nbetween those who had attended either an informally or formally integrated school. The over-\nall strength of the relationships in the bivariate analyses was measured using Chi-squared tests\n \n15. National identity and constitutional preferences are usually, but not always congruent, with Protestants gen-\nerally seeing themselves as British and Unionist, and Catholics as Nationalist and Irish (see Hayes and McAllister 1999a).\nThe two measures are highly correlated, and provide a convenient summary measure. Analyses using the two items\nseparately reach substantively the same conclusions.\n16. In addition, if respondents volunteered either an \u201cindependent state\u201d or some other answer as their preferred\nconstitutional outcome this option was also recorded.\n17. Tertiary education is generally a degree or graduate diploma, secondary qualifications are those gained at age\n15 or 16 years. The remainder are those without any formal educational qualifications.\n18. These were the most extensive socioeconomic control variables available in the data set.\n \nSP5404_03  Page 466  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n Education and Political Identities in Northern Ireland\n \n467\n \nand, in all cases, the specific location of the various differences in the relationship was esti-\nmated by a series of \n \nt\n \n-tests.\n \n19\n \nThe analysis proceeds in a number of stages. First, by way of introduction, we present\nthe proportion of Protestants and Catholics within the adult population by type of school\nattended. Then, via two logistic regression models\u2014one for formally integrated versus segre-\ngated schools and one for informally integrated versus segregated schools\u2014we estimate sys-\ntematically the degree to which there are any differences between Protestants and Catholics\nin relation to this issue.\n \n20\n \n We then turn to the impact of school integration on political atti-\ntudes. Starting first with national identity, we begin the investigation by presenting the pro-\nportion of Protestants and Catholics in terms of their various identity preferences as well as\ncongruency in identity preferences by type of school attended. To estimate the degree to\nwhich type of school attended is an independent and significant predictor of congruency in\nidentity patterns within both religious communities, we then estimate two separate multiple\nlogistic regression models, one for Protestants and one for Catholics, which includes type of\nschool attended, as well as a number of sociodemographic control variables such as gender,\nchurch attendance, age, and socioeconomic background. The analysis in terms of constitu-\ntional preferences proceeds in an identical manner. \nThe purpose of the various analyses is to investigate whether or not the long-term effects\nof integrated schooling on identity and territorial allegiances lend support to the contact the-\nsis and its various qualifying conditions. More specifically, irrespective of whether national\nidentity or constitutional preferences are considered, we wish to investigate whether or not\n \nTable 1 \u2022\n \nDescription of Independent Variables, Northern Ireland 1998\u20132003 Pooled Sample\n \nProtestant \n(\n \nn\n \n = 6,878)\nCatholic \n(\n \nn\n \n = 4,730)\nTotal \n(\n \nn\n \n = 11,608)\nVariable Coding of Variables Mean Std Dev Mean Std Dev Mean Std Dev\n \nGender (male) 1 = male, 0 = female .42\n \n\u2014\n \n.41\n \n\u2014\n \n.42\n \n\u2014\n \nChurch attendance\n(attends)\n7 point scale ranging\nfrom 0 to 1 \n.56* .39 .80 .33 .65 .38\nAge (years) From 18 to 96 years 50.08* 18.27 45.80 17.64 48.37 18.15\nEducation: All coded 1 or 0\nTertiary .16 \u2014 .15 \u2014 .16 \u2014\nSecondary .39 \u2014 .36 \u2014 .38 \u2014\nNo qualification .45* \u2014 .48 \u2014 .46 \u2014\nOccupation 1 = nonmanual\n0 = manual\n.53* \u2014 .45 \u2014 .50 \u2014\nEmployment 1 = in labor force\n0 = not in labor force\n.45* \u2014 .43 \u2014 .44 \u2014\nParental religion 1 = Protestant\n0 = Catholic\n.98* \u2014 .01 \u2014 .60 \u2014\n \nSources:\n \n Northern Ireland Referendum and Election Survey, 1998 (ARK 1998); Northern Ireland Election Study, 2003\n(ARK 2003)\n*significantly different from Catholics at the .05 level or above (two-tailed test)\n \n19.

The data in column 3 shows that, between 1989 and 2003, 11.6 percent of\nNorthern Ireland adults claimed to have attended a religiously mixed school. When the pro-\nportion of adults who had attended a \u201cformally integrated\u201d versus a \u201cfairly mixed\u201d school is\ndisaggregated this leads to a much lower estimate of 1.4 percent of the total adult population\nattending an integrated school, very close to the government estimate of 1.7 percent. By con-\ntrast, 10.2 percent of those who report attending a mixed school said that it was not formally\nintegrated, just one that was fairly mixed. The accuracy of these results is supported by the\nage distribution of the respondents experiencing formally integrated education: of those aged\n18 to 24 years old when interviewed, 4.4 percent said that they had attended a formally inte-\ngrated school, compared to just 0.5 percent of those aged 70 or over (results not shown here).\nThere is a statistically significant difference between Protestants and Catholics in relation to\nthis issue (Chi-square = 36.362, \n \np\n \n < 0.01), which, as the results from the series of \n \nt\n \n-test calcu-\nlations attest, is manifested across all three educational sectors. For example, a significantly\nlower proportion of Protestants (87 percent) as compared to Catholics (90 percent) report\nattending a segregated school, and a notable and comparatively higher proportion\u201412 percent\nas compared to 8 percent\u2014say that it was one that was just fairly mixed.\nTable 3 further explores these differences using two logistic regression models, one for\nformally integrated versus segregated schools and one for informally integrated versus segre-\ngated schools.

This pre-\nponderance of adults from a Protestant background who attended informally integrated\nschools may simply be explained by the Protestant nature of these schools. \nTurning to the long-term effects of integrated schooling on national and political identity,\nTable 4 presents the breakdown in type of school by identity for both Protestants and Catho-\nlics. Focusing initially on Protestants, an overall inspection of Table 4 suggests some statisti-\ncally significant differences among Protestants between type of school attended and attitudes\ntowards both national (Chi-square = 20.424, \n \np\n \n < 0.01) and political identity (Chi-square =\n16.995, \n \np\n \n < 0.01). In both cases, Protestants who had attended a formally integrated school\nstand out as being different in their attitudes than those who had not. For example, whereas\nat least seven out of every ten Protestants who had attended either a segregated or informally\nintegrated school chose the two dominant identities\u2014British and unionist\u2014the equivalent\nfigure among those who had experienced a formally integrated education was significantly\nlower at just 63 percent (British) and 54 percent (unionist) respectively. Thus, and in partial\nsupport of Hypothesis 1, at least as far as the impact of integrated schooling on support for the\ntwo dominant identities is concerned, it is attendance at a formally integrated school, and not\nan informally integrated one, that emerges as the key attribute in distinguishing attitudes\nbetween those who were educated in an integrated versus a segregated setting in this\ninstance.\nA similar, albeit converse, pattern emerges when nontraditional and less sectarian prac-\ntices such as the adoption of a Northern Irish identity or the absence of a political label are\nconsidered. Here, and in confirmation of Hypotheses 2 and 3, it is Protestants who have expe-\nrienced a formally integrated education who stand out as the most supportive in their views.\nFor example, whereas over two-fifths of Protestants who had attended a formally integrated\n \nTable 3 \u2022\n \nThe Impact of Parental Religion on School Integration in the Adult \nPopulation in Northern Ireland\n \nLogistic Regression Coefficients\nFormally Integrated Informally Integrated\n \nSociodemographic controls\n \nGender (male)\n \n\u2212\n \n.47** (.17)\n \n\u2212\n \n.03 (.06)\nAge\n18 to 29\n \na\n \n \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014\n30 to 39\n \n-\n \n.73**\n \n(.21)\n \n\u2212\n \n.32** (.10)\n40 to 49\n \n\u2212\n \n1.18** (.26)\n \n\u2212\n \n.35** (.11)\n50 to 59\n \n-\n \n.91**\n \n(.25)\n \n\u2212\n \n.34** (.11)\n60 to 69\n \n\u2212\n \n1.59** (.33)\n \n\u2212.25* (.11)\n70 + \u22121.93** (.36) \u2212.19 (.10)\nParental religion (Protestant) -.20 (.16) .38** (.07)\nConstant \u22123.00** \u22122.15**\n(N) (10,253) (11,249)\nSources: Northern Ireland Referendum and Election Survey, 1998 (ARK 1998); Northern Ireland\nElection Study, 2003 (ARK 2003)\nNote: Logistic regression equations showing parameter estimates and (in parentheses) standard errors\npredicting the probability of formally or informally integrated schooling as against segregated schooling.\naomitted category of comparison\n*p < .05 **p < .01 (two-tailed tests)\nSP5404_03  Page 469  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n470 HAYES\/MCALLISTER\/DOWDS\nschool chose to reject a unionist labor in favor of the intermediate and neutral \u201cneither\u201d\nposition, the equivalent figure among those who had experienced either an informally\nintegrated or segregated education was notably lower at just 28 percent and 26 percent\nrespectively. \nThis is not to deny the marked unwillingness of Protestants to cross traditional alle-\ngiances and associate with the opposing identity, a result all the more persuasive given their\nlack of indecision in relation to this issue.21 Even among those educated in formally inte-\ngrated schools, almost no Protestant was willing to identify himself or herself as Irish (less\nthan four percent in both cases) or to adopt a nationalist identity (less than three percent).\nThus, in further confirmation of Hypothesis 3, Protestants who had experienced a formally\nintegrated education may be considered to occupy the middle ground of Northern Ireland\npolitics in that they are willing to detach themselves from the dominant poles of identity\u2014\nBritish and unionist\u2014but reticent to adopt the identity of the other side. Finally, as an inspec-\ntion of the relationship between school type and identity patterns within the Catholic popu-\nlation indicates, and as predicted by Hypothesis 4, there is evidence to suggest that this\nsignificantly greater propensity among the formally integrated to abandon traditionally estab-\nlished views in favor of a more neutral position is an exclusively Protestant phenomenon. \nTable 4 \u2022 School Integration and Identity by Religious Denomination in the Adult Population in \nNorthern Ireland\nProtestant Catholic\nFormally\nIntegrated\nInformally \nIntegrated Segregated All\nFormally \nIntegrated\nInformally \nIntegrated Segregated All\nPercentages\nNational identity\nBritish 63.4 71.5a 72.2a 72.0 11.1 12.1 9.3 9.5\nIrish 3.7 2.8 2.5 2.6 59.3 56.3 64.8b 64.0\nUlster 3.7 5.6  8.2a 7.8 1.2 .5 .6 .6\nNorthern Irish 24.4 17.9 15.3a 15.7 27.2 29.5 24.0b 24.5\nOther 4.9 2.1  1.8 1.8 1.2 1.6 1.4 1.4\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n(N) (82) (780) (5,903) (6,765) (81) (380) (4,186) (4,647)\n(Chi-square = 20.424, 8 df, p < .01) (Chi-square = 12.632, 8 df, p < .01)\nPolitical identity\nUnionist 54.3 71.2a 73.2a 72.7 .0 1.6 1.0 1.0\nNationalist 2.5 .7 .8 .8 58.5 57.9 66.4b 65.6\nNeither 43.2 28.1a 26.0a 26.5 41.5 40.5 32.6b 33.4\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n(N) (81) (768) (5,843) (6,692) (82) (375) (4,166) (4,623)\n(Chi-square = 16.995, 4 df, p < .01) (Chi-square = 14.715, 4 df, p < .01)\nSources: Northern Ireland Referendum and Election Survey, 1998 (ARK 1998); Northern Ireland Election Study, 2003\n(ARK 2003)\nNote: asignificantly different from the formally integrated at .05 level or above (two-tailed tests)\nbsignificantly different from the informally integrated at the .05 level of above (two-tailed tests)\n21.

Furthermore, and in\npartial confirmation of Hypothesis 1, the key and statistically distinguishing factor that\nemerges from this investigation is attendance at an informally integrated school versus a seg-\nregated one. For example, 56 percent of Catholics who had attended an informally integrated\nschool claimed an Irish identity, but the equivalent proportion among those who had experi-\nenced a segregated education was higher at 65 percent. A similar, albeit converse, pattern\nemerges when nontraditional and less sectarian practices, such as the adoption of a Northern\nIrish label, are considered. For example, 30 percent of Catholics who had attended an infor-\nmally integrated school claimed a Northern Irish identity compared to 24 percent of those\nwho had experienced a segregated education. \nThere is a marked unwillingness among Catholics to cross traditional allegiances and\nassociate with the opposing identity. Even among those educated in either an informal or for-\nmally integrated setting, almost no Catholic was willing to adopt a unionist label and, irre-\nspective of school background, just one in ten was willing to identify himself or herself as\nBritish. Thus, at least as far as the Catholic population in concerned, the evidence in support\nof our various hypotheses is not as pervasive or clearcut. Only in relation to Hypotheses 1\nand 3\u2014the proposed differing and more moderate views in relation to identity patterns\namong those who had experienced an informally integrated education as compared to those\nwho had attended a segregated school\u2014is there some and, in the case of Hypothesis 1, only\npartial evidence in support of our various expectations at the bivariate level.\nIntegrated education is important in shaping identity. When the relationship between\nschool integration and congruency in identity within the Protestant community is consid-\nered, it is again Protestants who had attended a formally integrated school who stand out as\nbeing the least traditionalist in their views (see Table 5). Protestants who had attended a for-\nmally integrated school were significantly less likely to identify themselves as both British and\nunionist than those who had not. For example, whereas just over a third of Protestants who\nhad attended a formally integrated school claimed both a British and a unionist identity the\nequivalent percentages among those educated in either an informally integrated or segre-\ngated educational setting were notably higher at 57 percent and 58 percent respectively.\nAmong Catholics, the key distinguishing factor was attendance at an informally integrated\nschool versus a religiously segregated one. Catholics who had attended an informally inte-\ngrated school were less likely to identify themselves as both Irish and nationalist than those\nwho had experienced a segregated education. More specifically, whereas only around two-\nfifths of all Catholics who had attended an informally integrated school claimed both an\nIrish and nationalist identity just over half of all Catholics who had experienced a segregated\neducation did so.\nTable 5 \u2022 School Integration and Congruency in Religious, National, and Political \nIdentity in the Adult Population in Northern Ireland\nFormally Integrated Informally Integrated Segregated (Total)\nPercentages\nProtestant: British-Unionist 35.5  56.5a 57.5a (57.1)\nCatholic: Irish-Nationalist 43.8 42.2 51.8b (50.9)\nSources: Northern Ireland Referendum and Election Survey, 1998 (ARK 1998); Northern Ireland Election Study, 2003\n(ARK 2003)\nNote: asignificantly different from the formally integrated at .05 level or above (two-tailed tests)\nbsignificantly different from the informally integrated at the 0.05 level of above (two-tailed tests)\nSP5404_03  Page 471  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n472 HAYES\/MCALLISTER\/DOWDS\nMultivariate analysis supports these bivariate findings (see Table 6). After a range of\nbackground variables were controlled for in the analysis, Protestants who had attended a for-\nmally integrated school were significantly less likely to hold a British-Unionist identity than\nthose who had experienced a segregated education. A similar pattern emerges among those\nwho had experienced an informally integrated education within the Catholic community;\nCatholics who had attended an informally integrated school were significantly less likely to\nhold both an Irish and nationalist identity than their colleagues who had attended a reli-\ngiously segregated school.22 Thus, in comparison to their religiously segregated counterparts\nand in partial support for Hypothesis 1 in both instances, whereas the key factor in predicting\nProtestant attitudes is attendance at a formally integrated school, and not an informally inte-\ngrated one, among Catholics the reverse is the case. Here, it is attendance at an informally\nintegrated school, and not a formally integrated one, which emerges as the key predictor of\nattitudes in this instance. \nTo what extent are there differences in constitutional preferences when the impact of the\neducational sector is considered? Are individuals who have attended a formally integrated\nschool more likely to discount traditional territorial allegiances than those who have experi-\nenced a more religiously segregated education?

Focusing initially on Protestants, Table 7 suggests some statistically significant differ-\nences among Protestants between type of school attended and constitutional preferences\n(Chi-square = 52.255, p < 0.01). Protestants who had attended an integrated school are more\nlikely to move away from their traditional territorial allegiance\u2014maintenance of the link\nwith Britain\u2014and express an undecided position than those who had experienced either an\ninformally integrated or segregated education. The overwhelming majority of Protestants\nwho had attended either a fairly mixed or segregated school\u2014over 80 percent in both\ninstances\u2014favored retention of the union with Britain; by contrast, the equivalent propor-\ntion among those who had experienced a formally integrated education was just 65 percent. \nA converse pattern emerges when those who failed to express an opinion on the issue\nare examined; just 6 to 7 percent of those who had experienced an informally integrated or\nsegregated education expressed this indecisive view, compared to 15 percent among the for-\nmally integrated. Again, a notable finding is the marked unwillingness of Protestants to cross\ntraditional allegiances in their constitutional preferences. Very few Protestants were willing to\nsupport the reunification of Ireland, or even an independent Northern Ireland for that mat-\nter, and with one exception, there were no notable differences between the various educa-\ntional sectors in relation to this issue. Even among those educated in either an informal or\nformally integrated setting, almost no Protestant was willing to support the reunification of\nIreland (less than 5 percent in both cases) and, irrespective of school background, very few\n(just 4 percent) were willing to endorse an independent Northern Ireland. Thus, at least as far\nas constitutional preferences within the adult Protestant population are concerned, our\nbivariate results are more or less as predicted. In support of our various hypotheses, not only\nare Protestants who had experienced a formally integrated education significantly different in\ntheir constitutional preferences from those who had not (partial support for Hypothesis 1)\nbut they are also notably more likely than either the informally educated or those who had\nattended a segregated school to abandon traditionally established views in favor of a more\nneutral position or, in this instance, an indecisive view (support for Hypotheses 2 and 3).\nConstitutional preferences within the Catholic population are not as clearly differentiated\nby educational sector, although the key distinguishing factor in this instance is attendance at an\nTable 7 \u2022 School Integration and Constitutional Preferences by Religious Denomination in the Adult \nPopulation in Northern Ireland\nProtestant Catholic\nFormally\nIntegrated\nInformally \nIntegrated Segregated All\nFormally \nIntegrated\nInformally \nIntegrated Segregated All\nPercentages\nUnited Kingdom 65.4  80.8a  85.0ab 84.3 24.7 27.6 19.9b 20.6\nUnited Ireland 4.9 3.7 3.8 3.8 34.6 38.5 51.0ab 49.7\nIndependent NI 6.2 5.9 3.9b 4.1 14.8 10.9 9.9 10.1\nOther 8.6 2.9a 1.6ab 1.8 2.5 4.5 2.7 2.9\nDon\u2019t know 14.8 6.7a 5.8a 6.0 23.5 18.6 16.5 16.8\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n(N) (81) (781) (5,920) (6,782) (81) (377) (4,186) (4,644)\n(Chi-square = 52.255, 8 df, p < .01) (Chi-square = 34.504, 8 df, p < .01)\nSources: Northern Ireland Referendum and Election Survey, 1998 (ARK 1998); Northern Ireland Election Study, 2003\n(ARK 2003)\nNote: asignificantly different from the formally integrated at .05 level or above (two-tailed tests)\nbsignificantly different from the informally integrated at the .05 level of above (two-tailed tests)\nSP5404_03  Page 473  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n474 HAYES\/MCALLISTER\/DOWDS\ninformally integrated school versus a segregated one. In general, Catholics who had attended\nan informally integrated school were significantly more likely than their religiously segre-\ngated colleagues to abandon their traditional territorial allegiance by supporting the link with\nBritain. Just over half of Catholics who had attended a segregated school supported the\nreunification of Ireland as compared to 39 percent who had attended an informally inte-\ngrated school. A similar pattern emerges when the formally educated versus those who had\nexperienced a religiously segregated education are considered. Although no statistically sig-\nnificant difference emerged between individuals across these two educational sectors in terms\nof their support for the maintenance of the union, Catholics who had attended a formally\nintegrated school were less likely to support the reunification of Ireland than those who had\nattended a segregated one. \nThe most important finding is the willingness of Catholics to cross traditional boundaries\nand associate with those of the opposing territorial allegiance. Overall, just over one-fifth of\nCatholics support the link with Britain and a similar proportion remains undecided. Among\nCatholics, the results of the bivariate analysis on constitutional preferences again lend some\nsupport to our various hypotheses. Not only are Catholics who had attended an integrated\nschool\u2014either formal or informal\u2014significantly different in their constitutional preferences\nfrom those who had not (Hypothesis 1) but at least as far as those who had experienced an\ninformally integrated education are concerned they are also notably more likely to abandon\ntraditionally established views in favor of the majority view or, in this instance, maintenance\nof the link with Britain (Hypothesis 5). \nThe multivariate analysis in Table 8 supports these findings, although the distinguishing\nfactor for both Protestants and Catholics in this instance is prior experience of an integrated\neducation\u2014both formal and informal\u2014or not.23 After a range of background variables were\ncontrolled for in the analysis, Protestants who had attended either a formally or informally\nintegrated school were significantly less likely to support maintenance of the link with Britain\nthan those who had experienced a segregated education. An identical, albeit converse, pat-\ntern emerges within the Catholic community; Catholics who had attended either a formally\nor informally integrated school were significantly more likely to abandon their traditional ter-\nritorial allegiance and support retention of the link with Britain than their colleagues who\nhad attended a religiously segregated school. Furthermore, as an inspection of the parameter\nestimates for both the formally integrated and informally integrated attest, this willingness to\nabandon traditionally established allegiances appears to be more pronounced among those\nwho had experienced a formally integrated education than an informally integrated one. \nThese results on the long-term effects of integrated schooling on identity patterns and\nconstitutional preferences in Tables 4 to 8 therefore lend support to the contact thesis and its\nvarious qualifying conditions (Hypotheses 1 to 5). This is particularly the case when constitu-\ntional preferences are considered. Individuals who attended an integrated school\u2014either for-\nmal or informal\u2014were not only significantly different in terms of their attitudes from those\nwho had not (Hypotheses 1 and 2) but they were also more likely to abandon traditionally\nestablished allegiances in favor of either an intermediate (Hypothesis 3) or opposing position\n(Hypothesis 5), which, in the case of Catholics, represented the adoption of the majority\n(Protestant) community view. \nAlthough the impact of an integrated education on identity patterns is not as clearcut,\nthere is evidence to suggest that while the key factor in distinguishing attitudes within the\nProtestant community is whether or not an individual had attended a formally integrated\nschool or not, for Catholics, it was attendance at an informally integrated school versus a\n23. For the sake of parsimony in presentation, individuals who adopted a \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d stance in relation to this\nissue have been excluded from the analysis as a series of multinomial regression equations for both the Protestant and\nCatholic community found that school integration had no significant impact in differentiating between those who sup-\nported the union versus those who were indecisive in their views.\nSP5404_03  Page 474  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\nEducation and Political Identities in Northern Ireland 475\nsegregated one. More specifically, whereas Protestants who had attended a formally inte-\ngrated school not only significantly differed in their attitudes from those who had not (in par-\ntial support for Hypothesis 1 and support for Hypothesis 2), they were also more likely to\nabandon traditional identity patterns in favor of a more neutral position (Hypothesis 3).\nAlthough the impact of integrated education on identity patterns is different among Catho-\nlics, there is again evidence to suggest that at least in comparison to their previously reli-\ngiously segregated counterparts, Catholics who had experienced an informally integrated\neducation not only held significantly different views from those who attended a religiously\nsegregated school (in partial support of Hypothesis 1), but they were also more likely to adopt\nan intermediate position in relation to their identity preferences (Hypothesis 3). Finally, the\nsignificantly greater propensity among the formally integrated to abandon traditionally estab-\nlished identity patterns in favor of a more neutral position is an exclusively Protestant phe-\nnomenon (Hypothesis 4). \nDiscussion \nThe debate about the relationship between education and social development highlights\nthe tension between models that emphasize the importance of education as a mirror to soci-\nety and those that view education as an agent for change.

By bringing together in the same school environment children of diverse racial\nand ethnic backgrounds, it was hoped that schools could transform race relations and change\nthe \u201chearts and minds\u201d of ordinary Americans. Although a similar interpretation of the role\nof education came later to Northern Ireland, by the 1980s, popular opinion as well as govern-\nment policy had also endorsed this view. And, while support for the role of education in ame-\nliorating racial and ethnic divisions has fallen into disfavor in the United States (see Cashin\n2004), this is not the case in Northern Ireland. Opinion surveys show that not only is the cur-\nrent demand for places in integrated schools vastly outstripping supply, but that the vast\nmajority of the Northern Ireland population support the further establishment of integrated\nschools (see Gallagher and Smith 2002). \nTo what extent were parents and educators correct in their assumption that integrated\nschools would break down religious barriers and herald in a new era in community relations\nand politics in Northern Ireland? While the results of our study cannot provide a definitive\nanswer to this question, they do suggest that attendance at an integrated (both formal and\ninformal) school have long-term benefits in weakening sectarian political outlooks and pro-\nmoting a center and common ground in Northern Ireland politics, and this is particularly the\ncase within the Protestant community. \nAs our results show clearly, adult Protestants who had experienced either a formally or\ninformally integrated education were not only significantly different in their attitudes from\nthose who had not, they were also notably more likely to abandon traditionally established\nviews in favor of an intermediate or more neutral position in terms of both their identity pat-\nterns and constitutional preferences. The potential impact of integrated education in amelio-\nrating sectarian divisions within the Catholic community is not as clearcut. Although\nCatholics who had experienced an informally integrated education were significantly more\nlikely to adopt an intermediate position in relation to their identity preferences, this was not\nthe case when traditionally established territorial allegiances were considered. In fact, irre-\nspective of whether those who had experienced either a formal or informal integrated educa-\ntion were considered, Catholics who had attended an integrated school were significantly\nmore likely than those who had not to not only abandon traditionally established territorial\nallegiances (united Ireland) but also to disavow this traditional allegiance in favor of the dom-\ninant or majority view (retention of the link with Britain). More so than any other factor, this\nlatter finding underlines the potential tension of the political consequences of integrated edu-\ncation in trying to reduce intergroup conflict; one based on a shared compromise between\nthe aspirations of the two traditions versus a reduction in division due to an acceptance of the\ndominant view.\nThese results add weight to research that suggests that contact between different racial\nor ethnic groups can and does affect attitudes and that it can be an important and effective\ntool in reducing prejudice or, in this instance, divisive and sectarian political views. How-\never, as in more recent research on intergroup contact, our study also shows that the\nimpact of contact varies depending on the nature of the contact situation as well as the\nnumerical and status composition of the groups involved. Within formally integrated\nschools\u2014schools where we might most expect that Allport\u2019s proposed conditions for opti-\nmal intergroup contact to be met\u2014we find that past Protestant pupils in this instance were\nmore likely to have moved away from their traditional identity allegiances in favor of a\nmore overarching position. This supports Tropp and Pettigrew\u2019s (2005) majority-minority\nqualifying thesis, with members of the majority (Protestant) community being the most\naffected in terms of their views. \nA similar finding emerges with respect to the proposed impact of integrated education on\nminority views in relation to constitutional preferences. Although, as predicted by the majority-\nminority qualifying theses, individuals who had been in a clear minority position at school\n(Catholics who had attended an informally integrated school) were significantly more likely\nSP5404_03  Page 476  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\nEducation and Political Identities in Northern Ireland 477\nthan their previously religiously segregated counterparts to abandon traditionally established\nallegiances in favor of the majority (Protestant) community view, this was also the case\namong those who had attended a formally integrated school. Overall, as recently suggested\nby Tropp and Pettigrew (2005), one crucial and more generalized finding from this investiga-\ntion is that the impact of contact may vary significantly not only in terms of the contact situ-\nation but also in terms of the social status of the groups involved. This is not to discount the\npossible impact of other factors\u2014most notably the school environment\u2014in determining both\nCatholic and Protestant views in this instance. \nAs noted earlier, no single model of integration unites Northern Ireland\u2019s integrated\nschools and they vary considerably with regard to how actively they promote integration.\nNot all staff in integrated schools have been equally proactive in achieving an integrationist\nethos. In fact, previous research demonstrates that not only does considerable disparity exist\namong parents, teachers, and principals as to what constituted an integrated ethos within\nthese schools, but that many teachers admit to adopting a \u201cculture of avoidance\u201d where polit-\nically or religiously contentious issues were either glossed over or judiciously avoided. Fur-\nthermore, there is empirical evidence to suggest that contact concerns, rather than\ncurriculum issues, have dominated the working agenda of these schools. More importantly,\nas Donnelly (2006) notes, this view appears to be both shared and endorsed by the teachers\nthemselves, with many teachers in these schools believing that as long as the school declared\nitself \u201cintegrated\u201d and had roughly equal numbers of Catholic and Protestant pupils, teachers,\nand governors, it would, by its very nature, inculcate an ethos of tolerance and mutual\nunderstanding. \nA more pronounced pattern of segregation and cultural exclusivity emerges in the infor-\nmally integrated sector. Children within these religiously divided and essentially Protestant\nschools are not only taught by teachers drawn exclusively from the Protestant tradition but\nthey continue to celebrate exclusively British traditions such as the singing of Protestant\nhymns during assembly, the laying of wreaths on Remembrance Day services, and most\nimportantly, they also provide a pro-British curriculum as most clearly evidenced in the\nteaching of British history, often in a partisan and Anglo-centric manner. It is these two fac-\ntors\u2014the simplistic overreliance on contact between the two religious communities in for-\nmally integrated schools coupled with a lack of desire to proactively address issues of cultural\ndifferences via a genuinely inclusive and pluralist curriculum in both formally and especially\ninformally integrated schools\u2014rather than a product of their majority-minority status, which\nwe suggest may also be a key contributing factor in determining Protestant and Catholic\nopinion in this instance.\nThe interaction between integrated education and community relations in Northern\nIreland is, thus, both complex and contentious. A quarter of a century since the first inte-\ngrated college was established, the benefits of integrated education in breaking down reli-\ngious and cultural barriers are still disputed. The results of this study show that integrated\nschools are associated with the political outlooks of the pupils who attend them. Moreover,\nour study\u2014based on a large sample of the adult population\u2014suggests that the positive\neffects of integrated schooling extend into later life, a particularly important finding in light\nof U.S. findings as to the \u201chindsight\u201d nature of the experiences learned in desegregated\nschools. As the numbers experiencing integrated schooling grows, these individuals have\nthe potential to create a new common ground in Northern Ireland politics. As Northern Ire-\nland attempts to transcend violent political conflict, the importance of this group who have\nexperienced integrated education should not be underestimated. Despite the formal ratifi-\ncation of the Northern Ireland Agreement in 1998, and its many concerted efforts to\nenhance the center ground in politics, more recent research suggests that Northern Ireland\nhas become more, not less, religiously divided in the post-Agreement period, especially in\nrelation to electoral behavior and party preferences (see Hayes, McAllister, and Dowds\n2005). \nSP5404_03  Page 477  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\n478 HAYES\/MCALLISTER\/DOWDS\nIntergroup contact, even when formally endorsed within an educational setting, should\nnot be considered the only \u201ccure\u201d for prejudice and ethnic division. This is particularly the\ncase when deeply divided and polarized societies such as Northern Ireland are investigated.\nIntergroup contact via integrated schooling alone cannot be expected to tackle the mutually\nreinforcing problems of segregation, disadvantage (real and perceived), divergent political\naspirations as well as the pervasive \u201cthem\u201d and \u201cus\u201d mentality that continue to inform inter-\ncommunity relations within this society (Hayes and McAllister 2004; Hughes and Donnelly\n2002; Hughes et al. 2006). The results of this investigation suggest that intergroup contact via\nan integrated education system is not only a fruitful place to start, but it should also be one\nkey element within a wider strategy for addressing ethnic and\/or racial divisions within this\nand other societies who have experienced similar levels of ethno-political conflict.\nThis study has some important methodological limitations. First, given the cross-sec-\ntional nature of our data, there remains the question of the direction of causality. In the\nabsence of longitudinal data, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this question, how-\never, the weight of academic opinion supports our interpretation, namely, that contact\nthrough an integrated school setting leads to less sectarian political outlooks. Second, our\nmeasures of exposure to integrated education are rudimentary; we do not know for how long\nindividuals attended a formally integrated school and what, if any, particular mechanisms\nwere put in place by teachers and school authorities to foster an \u201cintegrationist\u201d ethos. In\nfact, contrary to the Tropp and Pettigrew (2005) minority-majority thesis, it could be argued\nthat the adoption of the majority (Protestant) constitutional view among Catholics who had\nattended either a formally or informally integrated school may be due to the pro-British\nnature of the school environment rather than a product of their minority status. A similar\nlack of information emerges in relation to individuals who attended an informally integrated\nschool; we do not know how long students attended these schools; what exactly the religious\nbalance in these schools was; and, more importantly, what efforts, if any, were made by\nteachers and the school authorities to accommodate their minority status. \nResolving these methodological limitations and evaluating their theoretical conse-\nquences should be a future research priority. Future research should critically examine the\nrole of integrated education in promoting more integrationist views among the general adult\npopulation and, where possible, utilize panel data. Only via a longitudinal approach can defi-\nnite conclusions be drawn about the causal effects of integrated education on identities, atti-\ntudes, and behavior. This research should also consider integrated education as part of the\nbroader educational system in Northern Ireland and its impact on tolerance and discrimina-\ntion in Northern Ireland. This would include comparisons not only with adults who had\nattended segregated schools, but also those who claimed to have had some cross-community\ncontact, albeit within an informally integrated setting. As our research on national identity\npatterns also demonstrates, among adult Catholics at least, it is the presence of members of\nthe other religious community in an informally integrated setting rather than a formally inte-\ngrated school per se, which leads to less sectarian views. \nIn order to assess the influence of parents as well as the nature of the actual contact situ-\nation, future research should not only include the opinions and sociodemographic back-\nground characteristics of parents but also investigate the degree to which these various\neducational settings\u2014integrated, informally integrated, and segregated schools\u2014facilitate or\ninhibit the promotion of nonsectarian views. A key component of this investigation should\ninclude a detailed analysis of both the nature and content of the curriculum with particular\nemphasis on the degree to which it identifies and promotes one cultural tradition\u2014British\nversus Irish, unionist versus nationalist\u2014at the expense of the other. This examination\nshould not only include a detailed examination of the various subjects taught but also the\noverall political content of the curriculum particularly in terms of the teaching of religious\nstudies as well as politics and history. A detailed investigation of this issue is particularly\nimportant in the light of previous research as to the diverse nature of integrated schools in\nSP5404_03  Page 478  Wednesday, October 17, 2007  4:24 PM\nEducation and Political Identities in Northern Ireland 479\nNorthern Ireland as well as the views of religious authorities, most notably the Catholic\nChurch, which continues to maintain that their schools are just as well placed as integrated\nones to promote reconciliation and foster less sectarian views with this society (Catholic Bish-\nops of Northern Ireland 2001) despite an insistence that maintaining a Catholic ethos is, in\ntheir view, central to school life. \nFinally, a detailed examination of the religious balance within the schools should also be\ntaken into account. This is particularly the case when Protestants in established Catholic\nschools are considered. As our research demonstrates, not only were Catholics who attended\ninformally integrated (established Protestant) schools more likely to adopt an intermediate\nstance in relation to their national identity but they were also significantly more likely to dis-\navow traditional territorial allegiances. To what extent are the views of Protestants similarly\naffected in established Catholic schools? Or, contrary to their Catholic counterparts, does\ntheir majority status within society impede the dissolution of traditionally established sectar-\nian attitudes even in situations where they are a numerical minority? Only via a detailed\ninvestigation of this issue for both religious communities will the mediating impact of major-\nity-minority relations on political outlooks within these various educational settings be com-\nprehensively understood. \nDespite the methodological challenges this paper leaves to future research, it is impor-\ntant to remember its primary contribution: to assess the impact of integrated education on\npolitical identities. Using contact theory as our explanatory framework, the primary purpose\nof the investigation was to assess whether or not individuals from the Catholic and Protestant\ncommunities in Northern Ireland who attended an integrated\u2014either formal or informal\u2014\nschool were less sectarian in their political outlooks than those who attended a religiously\nsegregated one. While much has been written about the impact of intergroup contact on\nreducing racial prejudice, to date its impact in terms of ameliorating political divisions has not\nbeen systematically assessed. It is to an investigation of this issue\u2014the long-term impact of\nintergroup contact on political identities\u2014that future research should be directed. As this\ninvestigation demonstrates, not only should these studies focus on the potentially important\nmediating influence of majority-minority relations within the contact situation but, where\npossible, the comparative influence of other interactive settings, as well as a detailed study of\nthe school environment, should also be assessed. Contrary to minority-majority thesis, it\ncould be argued that a key factor in accounting for both Protestant and Catholic views in this\ninstance may not be so much due to their differential status in a contact situation but rather\nderive from the absence of a genuinely pluralist and diverse environment within a school set-\nting. Thus, it is to an assessment of these two competing explanations\u2014intergroup contact\nversus the school environment\u2014in determining political outlooks that future research should\nbe directed. \nReferences\nAbbott, Lesley, Seamus Dunn, and Valerie Morgan. 1998.
