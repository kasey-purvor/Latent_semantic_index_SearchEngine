The overall aim in freshwater bioassessment is to use biological methods, metrics and \nforms of indices which are precise, in that they give repeatable results between replicate \nsamples, but which are also sensitive to changes in environmental impacts and stresses. We \ninvestigated the effects of excluding taxa with site-specific RIVPACS-type model expected \nprobabilities less than (or equal to) a threshold Pt (0.0, 0.1, 0.2,...,0.9) on the value, precision \nand power to detect biological effects of environmental stress using the observed to expected  \nratios (O\/E) of biotic indices used to assess the ecological status of UK river sites. \n2. Amongst the 614 high quality GB RIVPACS reference sites, excluding taxa with low \nexpected probabilities of occurrence gave less total variation (i.e. lower SD) in the estimates \nO\/E for number of taxa (O\/ETAXA) and the Average Score Per Taxon (O\/EASPT). \n3. A separate analysis of a replicated sampling study of sites from a wide range of physical \ntypes and qualities found that sampling variances in O\/E for reference condition sites \ndecreased as more locally-rare taxa were excluded (but only up to Pt = 0.5 for O\/EASPT). \nHowever, for moderately impacted and poor quality sites, estimates of both O\/ETAXA and \nO\/EASPT based on all (Pt = 0.0), or most  taxa (i.e. Pt \u2264 0.3) had lower sampling variances and \nwere more precise. \n4. Within a very large independent set of test sites with a wide range of perceived levels of \nenvironmental stress, increasing the threshold Pt led to systematic differences in the estimates \nof  both O\/E. Compared to using all taxa, high thresholds ( \u22650.5) gave lower O\/E values for \nvery high quality sites with O\/E>1 and higher values for moderate and poor quality sites \n(with the exception of O\/EASPT for the most severely stressed sites). \n5. Accuracy and statistical power to detect environmental stress (measured by the \npercentage of stressed sites with O\/E below the lower 10-percentile value for reference sites) \nwas very similar using O\/ETAXA for Pt up to 0.7. Using O\/EASPT, power to detect overall \ngeneral stress decreased slower as Pt was increased; the rate of fall in power was slightly \nfaster when restricted to sites subject to moderate or severe stress from organic inputs.   \n6. Taxa which are more sensitive to (organic) stresses (i.e. have high BMWP scores) tend to \nbe naturally less widespread (i.e. amongst reference sites) and thus were found to have \nconsiderably lower average site-specific expected probabilities; this may explain why the use \nof higher thresholds Pt can exclude more such sensitive taxa and lead to under-estimation of \nthe extent of impacts. \n7. The standard UK RIVPACS sampling and sample processing procedures aim to identify \nall taxa with a sample. This may lead to a longer distribution tail of rarer (low probability) \ntaxa than sampling methods based on a fixed count sub-sample and influence the practical \neffects of excluding rare taxa with low expected probabilities from bioassessments.\n 2\nIntroduction \nEmpirical predictive models were first applied to the bioassessment of freshwater quality by \nresearchers in the UK during the development of the River Invertebrate Prediction and \nClassification System (RIVPACS) (Wright et al., 1984; Moss et al., 1987; Wright, 1995). \nThe RIVPACS approach is now well established in the UK (Wright et al., 2000), Australia \n(Smith et al., 1999), Canada (Reynoldson et al., 2000), Sweden (Johnson, 2003) and the \nCzech Republic (Zahr\u00e1dkov\u00e1 et al., 2000), and is currently being developed and evaluated for \nother regions (Joy & Death, 2003; Ostermiller & Hawkins, 2004, Van Sickle et al., 2005). \n There are a number of steps involved in developing a regional RIVPACS model (Clarke et \nal., 2003, Bailey et al., 2004). First a comprehensive set of reference biological samples from \nhigh quality, minimally disturbed sites is collected to represent the full range of physical \nstream types present in the region, in terms of variation both between and within catchments. \nThe samples are collected and processed using standard protocols. Some form of cluster \nanalysis is then used to classify the samples into groups based on the similarity of their \nrecorded community composition. The relationships between the measured environmental \nfeatures and biological characteristics of the reference site groups are defined by multiple \ndiscriminant analysis (MDA). The derived discriminant functions are used to estimate the \nprobability of membership to each classification group for any site based on its values for the \nsame environmental features. The probabilities of the test site belonging to each classification \ngroup are combined with the proportional occurrence of each taxon amongst the reference \nsites in each of the groups to calculate (as weighted averages) the expected probabilities of \ncapture for each taxon at the test site, if it was also of reference high quality and minimally \ndisturbed (Clarke et al., 2003). The observed fauna at the test site (collected using the same \nstandardised procedures) can then be compared with the expected fauna to derive a \nbioassessment of the ecological status of the site. \nAlthough this comparison of observed and expected fauna can be done in a variety of ways \n(Clarke et al.,1996), most assessments around the world based on RIVPACS-type predictive \nmodels (cited above) concentrate on the use of the ratio of the observed (O) to site-specific \nexpected (E) number of taxa at the site (denoted O\/ETAXA). However, in the UK, national \nriver assessments by government environment agencies using macroinvertebrates are \ncurrently based on both O\/ETAXA and the ratio (denoted O\/EASPT) of the observed to expected \nvalues for the metric ASPT (Average Score Per Taxon) based on the BMWP (Biological \nMonitoring Working Party) system for scoring families (1-10) by their perceived tolerance to \n 3\norganic pollution (Armitage et al., 1983; Hemsley-Flint, 2000). The UK government agencies \nare working towards involving more metrics intended to measure specific types of stress to \nincorporate the best features of the multi-metric and multivariate predictive modelling \napproaches. \nWhile the process of RIVPACS model development and testing around the world usually \nfollows a similar generic path, individual models vary in some aspects e.g. field and \nlaboratory procedures, taxonomic resolution, statistical classification method, and whether to \nexclude locally-rare taxa from the calculation of O\/E values. Quantification of the variation \nand errors associated with one or more of these aspects has been addressed for a number of \ndifferent regional models (Moss et al., 1999; Clarke, 2000; Hawkins et al., 2000; Cao et al., \n2002; Clarke et al., 2002; Ostermiller & Hawkins, 2004). \nThe main topic of this paper concerns whether or not it is best to exclude taxa with low \nexpected probabilities of occurrence at a site from its bioassessment. In particular, we \ninvestigate the effect of only including taxa which have more than a certain threshold (Pt) of \nexpected probability of occurrence at a site on the estimation, sampling precision and power \nto detect environmental stress of O\/E ratio(s) across a range of types and qualities of site. \nHistorically, UK RIVPACS models have included all taxa (i.e. Pt =0) in assessments, in the \nbelief that the many locally rare taxa are likely to be the first to disappear as a site becomes \nmore stressed. While this assumption has yet to be rigorously tested, there is a suggestion that \nexcluding rare taxa can reduce the sensitivity of community-based assessments through its \ndifferential effects on sites depending on their taxa richness and abundance patterns (Cao et \nal., 1998). This view is contested by others workers who argued that excluding rare taxa leads \nto reduced variance in model predictions and hence more confidence in the assessment of \nquality at a site (Hawkins et al. 2000; Marchant, 2002). \nPredictive models in the Australian River Assessment Scheme (AUSRIVAS) use Pt = 0.5, \nbased on the initially untested assumption that taxa with low probabilities of occurring at a \nsite do not contribute reliable information to the bioassessment of site condition (Smith et al. \n1999; Simpson and Norris 2000). Based on a study of 234 references sites and 254 test sites \n(potentially impaired by past logging), Hawkins et al. (2000) found that site assessments \nbased on using Pt = 0.0 were more variable than those based on Pt = 0.5 and concluded that \nthe inclusion of more taxonomic information from such locally-rare taxa would decrease \nmodel sensitivity to deterioration in site condition. Marchant (2002) examined the effect of \n 4\nvarying Pt on the variability in O\/E for number of genera between seven sites immediately \nbelow large dams in Victoria, Australia. Because the sites were severely impacted with \naverage O\/E of around 0.5, all sites were classed as impacted (i.e. O\/E less than the lower 10 \npercentile value of 0.82 for reference sites) regardless of the threshold used, except for one \nsite when Pt =0.9, which he took as evidence to support the use of Pt =0.5 in AUSRIVAS. \nHowever, his main analysis (see Figure 1 in Marchant (2002)) had shown that the variability \nin O\/E between the sites was least when all taxa were included (coefficient of variation(CV) \n= 6.2% for Pt =0), or when Pt = 0.1 (CV=8.0%), and increased with the threshold used (CV = \n17.8%, 18.3% and 39.4% for Pt =0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 respectively). This evidence actually \nprovides some support for using all taxa in site assessments. Moreover, Turak and Koop \n(2003) examined multiple-year data from two sites in New South Wales, Australia and \nconcluded that including all taxa (i.e. with Pt = 0) in AUSRIVAS estimates of O\/E enhances \nthe ability to detect differences in levels of disturbance compared to using the recommended \nthreshold Pt of 0.5.  Johnson & Sandin (2001) investigated the effect of threshold (Pt) values \nof 0.0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 on the strength of the correlation between O and E values and the \nstandard deviation (SD) of O\/E values for number of taxa with a set in reference sites in \nSweden predicted using the stream riffle RIVPACS models (SWEPACSRI). They suggested a \ncompromise threshold of 0.25.  \nRecently, Ostermiller & Hawkins (2004) concluded that it was difficult to determine what \noptimal Pt value would give a precise predictive model, in terms of eliminating noise \nassociated with very rare taxa, and at the same time a sensitive model, in terms of \nincorporating as much (biological response) information on the taxa-environment relationship \nas possible. Cao et al. (2001, p149-150) give a clear summary of the problem in terms of the \ntwo types of error in site bioassessments, namely (i) indicating a non-existing impact or over-\nestimating an impact, and (ii) failing to detect an impact or under-estimating its size. They \nconclude that the inclusion or exclusion of rare taxa appears to be mainly related to (ii) in that \nif an assessment based on only abundant (or high probability) taxa does not detect an impact, \nit may be because only the rarer species have been affected (or eliminated from the site).  \nIn our view, although low probability taxa may individually contribute little, there are often \nmany of them, so collectively they may be very informative. The overall aim in any \nbioassessment is to use biological methods, metrics and forms of indices which are precise, in \nthat they give repeatable results between replicate samples, but which are also sensitive to \nchanges in environmental impacts and stresses. \n 5\nThe choice of the optimal Pt has not been comprehensively investigated across a range of \nsites with different levels of impairment. Recent studies on this issue have proved \ninconclusive, in terms of their relevance to RIVPACS-type models for general use, as they \nhave generally investigated the effect of excluding rare taxa on limited datasets (Cao et al., \n1998; Marchant, 2002), or on sites drawn only from reference site datasets (Johnson, 2003) or \nhave only compared a very restricted number of Pt values (Hawkins et al., 2000; Ostermiller \n& Hawkins, 2004). In their excellent study of the impact of various aspects of a sampling \nmethodology, Ostermiller & Hawkins (2004) found that the standard deviation (SD) in O\/E \nvalues for their reference sites was less for Pt =0.5 than for Pt =0.0 for all fixed sub-sample \nsizes tested, from which they concluded that models based on the use of Pt =0.5 were more \nprecise. However, in the extreme if you base O\/E values only on those taxa which are \n(nearly) always found (Pt \u2265 0.9) at that type of reference site, then the observed and expected \nnumber of taxa for the reference sites must be almost identical so that O\/E values will hardly \nvary about unity. Although sampling precision and repeatability for high quality sites is \nobviously important to minimise the occurrence of type 1 errors, the detection and estimation \nof the extent of impacts will depend on the (potentially different) sampling precision in O\/E \nratios for poorer quality sites and the extent to which they differ from O\/E values for \nreference sites. \nWe assessed the effect of varying Pt on the values, precision and accuracy of RIVPACS \nmodel estimates for both O\/ETAXA and O\/EASPT. In particular the effect of Pt on four factors \nwas assessed: (i)  overall variation (SD) in O\/E for RIVPACS reference sites, (ii) replicate \nsampling SD in O\/E across a wide range of qualities of site and (iii) systematic differences in \nthe value of O\/E for sites from a range of water qualities and stream types, and most \nimportantly (iv) the resulting statistical power to detect biological impacts at independently \nassessed environmentally stressed sites.  \n \nMethods \nRelevant aspects of the UK RIVPACS reference sites, sampling and model development \nmethodology \nIn the UK, there is currently a single RIVPACS prediction and site assessment module for the \nwhole of mainland Great Britain (GB) based on 614 reference sites (Moss, 2000); although \nseparate modules have recently been developed for Northern Ireland and the Scottish islands. \n 6\nAll reference sites have been sampled using standard RIVPACS sampling and sample \nprocessing procedures (Wright et al., 1984; Environment Agency, 1999). This involves a 3 \nminute active kick sample with a pond net plus a 1-min hand search for taxa likely to be \nmissed in the kick sample e.g. those adhered to large stones and bedrock. All habitats within \nthe site are sampled in proportion to their occurrence. In the laboratory, the entire sample is \ncarefully sorted through for macroinvertebrates, with the aim of identifying and recording all \nof the taxa within the sample (but using where appropriate varying degrees of sub-sampling \n(1\/2, 1\/4, 1\/8 sample, etc) purely to estimate the abundance of very common taxa) (Wright, \n2000). The procedure of sorting through the whole sample within the aim of finding all of the \ntaxa present is an important difference in the RIVPACS method compared to some other \nmethods which only identify a \u201crandom\u201d sub-sample and\/or a random fixed number of \nindividuals in a sample. This could have repercussions for the effect of excluding locally-rare \ntaxa from site assessments and is discussed further below.  \nEach reference site was sampled once in each of spring (March - May), summer (June - \nAugust) and autumn (September - November). A single classification of the reference sites \ninto groups was derived for the GB module based on the best available biological information \nfor each site, namely the three seasons combined fauna based on presence-absence of species \nand log abundance category of families. The MDA functions can then be used to derive both \nsite- and season-specific predictions of the fauna to be expected for any single season sample \nor any combined season (e.g. spring+autumn, or spring+summer+autumn) sample, which can \nthen be compared with the corresponding observed sample fauna for the same season(s) from \nany site. \nClarke et al. (1996) pointed out that the reference sites used in any RIVPACS-type model \nwill not all be of the same biological quality. In practice, they usually represent the top class \nof sites, and are likely to be very variable in quality. The variation and distribution of the \nsample O\/E values for a set of reference sites is therefore due to both sampling variation and \nmethodological errors, but also due to real variation in their true quality - albeit unknown. \nTherefore, some variation in O\/E values amongst references sites is always to be expected.  \n \nBAMS study sites used to estimate sampling variation in O\/E  \nThe analysis of replicate sampling variation was based on the 16 sites used by Clarke et al. \n(2002) to assess patterns of sampling variation in BMWP-based indices. These study sites \n 7\nwere selected from a listing of over 5000 sites sampled during the 1990 national river quality \nsurvey (RQS) throughout England and Wales. Based on their environmental characteristics, \nthe study sites were selected from four site groups (Table 1a), chosen to encompass the four \nmajor site divisions and site types within the RIVPACS II hierarchical classification (Wright, \n1995). Next, within each of the four site groups, one study site was selected at random from \nthe list of RQS sites in each of the four quality grades (Table 1b), giving a total of 16 sites, \nreferred to as the BAMS (Biological Assessment Methods Study) sites, \nEach BAMS site was sampled in each of the three RIVPACS seasons using the standard \nRIVPACS sampling procedures. On each sampling occasion and at each site, three \nmacroinvertebrate samples were collected, the first and third were taken by an Institute of \nFreshwater Ecology (now CEH) biologist and the second by a local Government environment \nagency biologist. Care was taken to minimise the possibility of re-sampling the same \nlocations within the site in order to avoid progressive depletion of the fauna. At any given site, \nthe same biologists took the samples in each of the three seasons, but the personnel varied \nbetween sites and regions. The macroinvertebrate samples were all sorted and identified by \nexperienced IFE\/CEH biologists using the standardised RIVPACS protocols (Wright et al., \n1984; Environment Agency, 1999). Three people also made independent estimates of the \nRIVPACS environmental predictor variables and hence expected fauna at each site - leading \nto three independent estimates of O\/E values. \n \nGQA (General Quality Assessment) sites and their anthropogenic stresses \nThe third sets of sites involved in the analyses reported here (in addition to the 614 \nRIVPACS reference sites and the 16 BAMS sites) are 5752 sites from the Environment \nAgency (EA)\u2019s General Quality Assessment (GQA) national survey of river sites throughout \nEngland and Wales in 1995 (Murphy & Davy-Bowker, 2005). Samples were taken in both \nspring and autumn. The results of our analyses are presented for spring samples, but similar \nresults were obtained for autumn samples.  \nThis large dataset was used to test for systematic dependence of O\/E on the threshold \nprobability Pt. and, most importantly, to assess the effect of the choice of Pt on the statistical \npower of the resulting O\/Es to detect the biological impacts of anthropogenic stress operating \nat the site. The severity of  each of 12 major types of anthropogenic stress acting on each site \nwas recorded by local EA biologists from their detailed knowledge of sites and catchments in \n 8\ntheir area (Table 2) (Murphy & Davy-Bowker, 2005). EA catchment management plans were \nalso consulted by biologists where more information was needed. We derived an overall \nmeasure of stress intensity by dividing the sum (S) of the levels of the 12 stress types into \nfour classes (Table 2). \n \nCalculating O\/E for different threshold expected probabilities \nIf taxon i (species or family) occurs in rij of the nj reference sites in group j, then the \nRIVPACS expected probability, pi, of finding a particular taxon i  at a particular test site, if \nthe site is unstressed, is estimated from the proportion qij = rij\/nj of reference sites in each \ngroup j with taxon i present, weighted by the test site\u2019s probabilities Gj of belonging to each \ngroup j, namely (Clarke et al., 2003): \n  \u2211=\nj\nijji qGp\nThe expected number of taxa (ET) for a site is simply the sum of the site-specific expected \nprobabilities of the individual taxa, namely: \n          (1) \u2211=\ni\niT pE\nThe observed value (OA) of ASPT for a site is calculated as the sum (OS) of the individual \nBMWP scores (Bi) of the OT BMWP-scoring taxa present, divided by OT. Calculation of the \nexpected value, EA, of ASPT is more complex as it is a ratio of variables, but a very good \napproximation (from Clarke et al., 1996) is given by: \n23 \/\/\/ TSTTSTTTSA EvEEvEEE \u2212+=       (2) \nwhere  = expected value of total BMWP score ,  \u2211=\ni\niiS pBE\n\u2211 \u2212=\ni\niiTT ppv )1(  and  \u2211 \u2212=\ni\niiiST ppBv )1( .\n(Note: Equation (2) is the same as equation (11) in Clarke et al. (1996) except that the last \nterm  should be subtracted not added; the term is minor, the effect is negligible and \nimportantly, the correct formula has always been used in all versions of RIVPACS software \ncode). \n2\/ TST Ev\nThe O\/E ratios for number of taxa and ASPT are then given by: \n 9\nTTTAXA EOEO \/\/ =  and       (3) AAASPT EOEO \/\/ =\nWhen the O\/E ratios for a site are to be based on only those taxa with site-specific expected \nprobabilities of occurring {pi} greater than a threshold probability Pt, then only those taxa for \nwhich pi > Pt are included in the calculation of both the observed (O) and expected (E) and \nhence O\/E values of each metric; in our case, \u2018number of taxa\u2019 and ASPT based on equations \n(1)-(3). In our study, the effect of a wide range of threshold probabilities was assessed, using \nPt = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, where Pt = 0.0 is equivalent to including all \nof the taxa in the calculation of O\/E ratios and site assessments. \n \nResults \nIllustration of the potential effect of using different thresholds \nTo illustrate the effect of using different threshold probabilities on O\/E values, a detailed \ncomparison of the observed and expected fauna was made for a replicate sample from one of \nthe moderately impacted BAMS sites (Table 3). In general, as more taxa are excluded so both \nthe observed and expected number of taxa can only decrease, but their ratio O\/ETAXA can, in \ntheory, go up or down. In this example O\/ETAXA increased as the threshold probability for \nexclusion was increased from 0.0 to 0.9. This was also true for the two other replicate spring \nsamples from this site (Fig. 1). \n \nEffect of threshold on distribution and SD  of O\/E values for RIVPACS reference sites \nWe assessed the effect of using each threshold probability on the distribution of O\/E values \nfor the 614 RIVPACS reference sites for mainland Great Britain (Table 4, Fig. 2). Results are \nshown for spring samples, but similar patterns were obtained with samples from other \nseasons. The overall mean value of O\/ETAXA was always around one, but the distribution \nbecame less variable as the threshold was increased (Figure 2a). In particular, the standard \ndeviation (SD) started to decline considerably once the threshold Pt was above 0.2 or 0.3 \n(Table 4(a)). Hawkins et al. (2000) and Ostermiller & Hawkins (2004) also found smaller \noverall SD in the O\/E values of reference sites when based on a threshold probability of 0.5 \ncompared to when including all taxa (Pt = 0.0). However, as seen in Figure 2a, the biggest \ncause of the reduction in overall SD is that excluding taxa expected to be locally rarer reduces \nthe frequency and extent of high O\/E values well above 1. In the extreme, with a threshold of \n 10\n0.9, all of the observed taxa must have at least a 90% expected probability of occurring, so it \nis mathematically impossible to get an O\/ETAXA value greater than 1\/0.9, namely 1.111. The \nmedian (but not mean) value of O\/ETAXA was slightly above unity for high values of Pt \n(Figure 2(a)). \nA similar pattern was observed for the distribution of O\/E for ASPT for the same RIVPACS \nreference sites (Fig. 2b). Again, the SD changed very little up to a threshold of 0.3, but \nthereafter decreased (until Pt = 0.9) (Table 4(a)). However, unlike for O\/ETAXA, at high \nthresholds, there is increased likelihood of occasional very high or low values of O\/EASPT, \nbecause the ASPT metric is an average (score per taxon present) and its value can change \ndramatically and erratically when dependent on the chance presence-absence of only a few \ntaxa. \n \nEffect of threshold on sampling precision of O\/E across a range of site qualities \nThe precision of O\/E estimates based on different threshold probabilities Pt was assessed \nusing the BAMS sites data for which there were three replicated samples and three \nindependent estimates of O\/E values for each of three sampling seasons across a wide range \nof types and qualities of river sites in the UK. \nIn order to summarise the replicate sampling SD robustly for each expected probability \nthreshold Pt, the data were grouped into three quality classes according to the replicate mean \nvalue of O\/ETAXA (Fig. 3(a)). Using Pt =0, the sampling SD of O\/ETAXA increased with site \nquality (Table 5(a)); this is not unexpected as Clarke et al. (2002) found that replicate \nsampling SD of the observed number of taxa in a sample increased with site taxa richness.  In \ncontrast, when very high expected probability thresholds were used, sampling variability in \nO\/ETAXA was highest at intermediate site quality For the high quality class of sites with \nreplicate mean O\/ETAXA greater than 0.9, the sampling SD decreased as Pt was increased, as \nwas found previously for reference sites. The only exception was for the extreme threshold Pt \n= 0.9, but this was because the class lower limit for replicate mean O\/E was sufficiently low \nto encompass one of the mildly stressed sites for which O\/E was more variable when based \non such a high threshold probability and thus only a few taxa. For intermediate quality mildly \nstressed sites with replicate mean O\/ETAXA in the range 0.6-0.9, the general pattern was \nreversed - assessments involving all or most taxa had the lowest SD and greatest precision \n(Fig. 3(a)). Using high thresholds leads to only relatively few taxa being involved, which may \n 11\nor may not still be present (and counted), giving rise to more variable O\/E values. At poor \nquality sites with replicate mean O\/ETAXA less than 0.6, all thresholds gave similar, relatively \nlow, sampling SD in the range 0.058-0.079 (Table 5(a)). One-way ANOVA was used to \nestimate the overall average replicate sampling variance across all site and season \ncombination for each threshold. The overall average replicate SD was about the same (0.072-\n0.074) for expected probability thresholds up to 0.4, but thereafter increased (\u201coverall\u201d \ncolumn in Table 5(a)). \nIn similar analyses for O\/EASPT, sampling SD of O\/EASPT for high quality sites was \nmarginally highest for Pt = 0.0 (Table 5(b), Fig 3(b)). However, at intermediate and poor \nquality sites with replicate mean values of O\/EASPT less than 0.9, assessments based on using \neither all the taxa (Pt = 0.0), or an expected probability threshold of no more than 0.3, had the \nlowest sampling SD (Fig. 3(b)). All thresholds (except Pt = 0.9) gave slightly higher sampling \nSD once replicate mean O\/EASPT dropped below 0.7, mainly because fewer taxa were \ninvolved in determining the observed ASPT. Averaged over all sites and seasons, the overall \naverage sampling SD was about the same (0.046-0.050) for thresholds up to 0.5, but \nthereafter increased (Table 5(b)). \n \nEffect of threshold on value of O\/E \nTo obtain a reasonably precise estimate of  any systematic differences in average value of \nO\/E arsing from using different thresholds, the O\/E values based on each threshold Pt were \ncalculated for all of the spring samples from the 5752 GQA sites. For each sample, the O\/E \nvalue based on Pt = 0.0 was subtracted from the O\/E based on each non-zero threshold to \ngive the differences in O\/E. The samples were then grouped into classes according to their \nO\/E based on Pt = 0.0. The median differences in O\/E values for each threshold for each class \nof site are given in Figure 4.  \nA threshold Pt of 0.1 gave negligible systematic difference in O\/ETAXA for qualities of sites \nexcept those with the very highest values when based on all taxa (Fig. 4(a)). When the value \nof O\/ETAXA based on all of the taxa was around unity (i.e. observed and expected number of \ntaxa agree), then the median difference in O\/ETAXA value using any non-zero threshold was \nrelatively small, indicating that such O\/ETAXA values were roughly equally likely to be higher \nor lower than those based on all taxa (Fig. 4). However for poorer quality sites (i.e. those with \nO\/ETAXA values <0.9), the median difference was always positive and the difference \n 12\nincreased with the value of the threshold Pt, indicating that there was a systematic tendency \nfor the estimate of O\/ETAXA for stressed sites to increase as more of the lowest probability \ntaxa were excluded from the site assessments (Fig. 4). For sites with values of O\/E well \nabove unity when based on all taxa, the O\/E estimates tended to be less when based solely on \nthe taxa with higher expected probabilities of occurrence at the sites(Fig. 4). \nThe pattern of systematic differences in O\/EASPT resulting from increasing the threshold \nprobability were largely similar to those for O\/ETAXA (Fig. 4). For both O\/E indices, the \ndifferences using any of the non-zero threshold probabilities was greatest for sites of \nintermediate-poor quality. However, in contrast to O\/ETAXA, values of O\/EASPT for the very \npoorest quality sites with O\/EASPT less than 0.5 did not show any systematic change with \nthreshold Pt (Fig. 4(b)).  \nOverall, our analyses show a systematic tendency for O\/E values for a site to become closer \nto unity as the threshold of expected probability is increased. In other words, using higher \nthresholds makes it more difficult (or even impossible) to obtain O\/E values far above or, \nmore importantly, far below unity. We were concerned that these results might be an artefact \ndue to grouping the GQA sites on the basis of their O\/E values calculated using all of the taxa \n(i.e. Pt = 0.0). Therefore, the GQA sites were re-grouped into classes on the basis of their O\/E \nvalues calculated using a threshold of Pt = 0.5. For each sample, the O\/E value based on Pt = \n0.5 was subtracted from the O\/E values based on each other threshold (including Pt = 0.0) to \ngive the differences in O\/E. The patterns of median differences in O\/E values for each \nthreshold for each class of site are shown in Fig. 5. Thresholds less than 0.5 (included Pt = \n0.0) show a tendency to give lower values of O\/ETAXA when the O\/E for Pt = 0.5 is less than \nunity and higher values when O\/E for Pt = 0.5 is greater than unity. Also O\/ETAXA values for \nthresholds greater than 0.5 showed the same pattern as before, giving values of O\/E closer to \nunity than those based on a threshold of Pt = 0.5. For sites of intermediate quality (in the \nsense of having O\/EASPT values for Pt = 0.5 in the range 0.5 \u2013 0.9), thresholds less than 0.5, \non average give lower values of O\/EASPT, and vice versa. The median differences are less for \nvery poor quality sites (i.e. with O\/EASPT < 0.5). \nTogether these results indicate that increasing the expected probability threshold Pt for taxa \nto be involved in the calculation of O\/E values leads to systematic changes in the estimates of \nO\/E. Most importantly, increasing the threshold Pt leads to a compression of the whole scale \nof O\/E towards unity, which may have repercussions for the ability to detect the impact of \nstress.  \n 13\n Effect of threshold on statistical power to detect biological impacts of anthropogenic stress \nWe have shown that the variability in O\/E for reference sites, the sampling variation of O\/E \nfor impacted sites and the extent of changes from unity in O\/E values are all affected by the \nchoice of the threshold expected probability Pt. However, it is the combination and interplay \nof these factors which determines the statistical power to detect the biological effects of \nenvironmental and anthropogenic stress. Using a higher threshold may lead to less reduction \nin O\/E for stressed sites, but providing the natural variability in O\/E for high-quality \nreference sites (based  on the same  Pt) is lower and the sampling variability for stressed sites \nis not (much) greater, then using the higher threshold may provide greater statistical power to \ndetect departure from reference conditions. An O\/E value of, for example, 0.7, does not have \nthe same interpretation in terms of extent of any biological impact for all values of Pt. We \nassessed the statistical power to detect impacts using each threshold Pt using the large GQA \ndataset for which we had independent assessments of the intensity of anthropogenic stresses \noperating at each site (Table 2). \nClarke et al. (1996) suggested using some lower percentile of the distribution of O\/E values \nfor the reference sites\/samples as the lower limit of O\/E for which any test site would be \nclassified as of \u201creference\u201d quality class. Van Sickle et al. (2005) treated test sites as \nimpaired if their O\/E values were outside the interval (mean \u00b1 2 SD) determined from the \nO\/E for the reference samples. Ostermiller and Hawkins (2004) considered a test site as \nsignificantly different from reference if its O\/E value was outside the 10th to 90th percentiles \nof reference site O\/E values. We used the lower 10-percentile values of O\/ETAXA and O\/EASPT \nfor the RIVPACS GB reference sites to set the critical value for deciding whether test sites \nshould be classified as \u201cstressed\u201d (lower O\/E) or \u201creference\u201d (higher O\/E). Using this type of \nrule ensures that a known fixed percentage of the RIVPACS model reference sites\/samples \nwould be incorrectly classified as \u201cimpaired\u201d (i.e. the overall type 1 error equals 10%). \nThe GQA sites were classified into four stress intensity classes according to their score S \nrepresenting their overall loading of anthropogenic stresses (Table 2, Table 6). A GQA site \nwas classified as \u201cimpacted\u201d if its O\/E value based on a particular threshold Pt was less than \nthe critical O\/E value for the reference sites based on the same Pt. Using O\/ETAXA, the \nstatistical power to detect biological impacts among sites subject to \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d \n 14\nlevels of  overall stress was very similar for all thresholds up to 0.7; although the marginally \nhighest power occurred for Pt equal to 0.1 or 0.2 (Table 6). \n When based on O\/EASPT, the statistical power to detect the biological impacts of \n\u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d levels of stress was marginally highest (72%) when all taxa were \ninvolved in the calculation of O\/EASPT, but only declined slowly with increasing threshold up \nto Pt of 0.6, and was lowest for Pt \u2265 0.7 (Table 6). The percentage of \u201cunstressed\u201d GQA sites \nincorrectly classified as being impacted (i.e. type 1 error) was similar for all values of the \nthreshold Pt for both O\/E indices with the exception of higher mis-classification rates for \nO\/EASPT based on Pt = 0.9. \nThe ASPT metric was originally intended to provide a measure of the biological response of  \nfreshwater macroinvertebrate communities to stress resulting from organic inputs (e.g. from \nagriculture or effluent). Therefore, we also assessed the effect of varying Pt on the statistical \npower to detect biological impacts using O\/EASPT amongst the GQA classified according to \ntheir perceived level of stress from organic inputs only (Table 6). The statistical power of \nO\/EASPT for each threshold Pt was higher when the analysis was restricted to detecting severe \nlevels of stress specifically from organic inputs (Table 6). Although still highest (79%) for Pt \n= 0, statistical power of detecting severe organic input stress was similar (74-79%) for all \nthresholds up to Pt = 0.5.  \nIt was encouraging to find that the percentage of sites classified as impacted on the basis of \ntheir O\/E values increased with the perceived intensity of anthropogenic stress operating at a \nsite, as one would hope. In addition, the percentage of sites with no known significant overall \nstress loading (i.e. \u201cunstressed\u201d sites) which were mis-classified as impacted on the basis of \ntheir O\/E values was only 11-20% for both metrics based on thresholds up to 0.7 (Table 6); \nthis is not enormously greater than the 10% type 1 error expected from reference \nsites\/samples. \n \nDiscussion \nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of excluding taxa with low site-specific \nexpected probabilities (based on RIVPACS-type models) on the precision and accuracy of \nO\/E ratios of biotic indices and on their statistical power to detect the biological impacts of \nanthropogenic stresses in bioassessments of the ecological status of sites. In particular, we \nhave assessed the previously-unknown effects of changing probability threshold Pt on \n 15\nbioassessments based on the use of the standard RIVPACS sampling and sample processing \nprocedures, as used by the government environment agencies (and CEH) throughout the UK \n(Environment Agency, 1999). The conclusions can be summarised as follows: \n(i) Excluding taxa with low expected probabilities of occurrence results in less \nvariation (i.e. lower SD) in the O\/E estimates for reference sites;  \n(ii) Estimates of O\/E based on all, or most  taxa (i.e. using a low Pt) give the lowest \nsampling variances at moderately impacted and poor quality sites; \n(iii) Increasing the threshold probability Pt for excluded taxa causes systematic \ncompression of the realised O\/E scale towards unity, in that O\/E values >1 are on \naverage reduced, while O\/E values <1 have a tendency to be higher and closer to \nunity. \n(iv) The combined effect of these factors was that statistical power to detect the overall \nbiological impacts of anthropogenic stresses based on O\/ETAXA was similar for \nthresholds Pt up to 0.7 (and marginally optimum at Pt  of 0.1 or 0.2); \n(v) When based on O\/EASPT, power to detect impacts from both overall stress and \nspecifically organic impacts was similarly high for Pt \u2264 0.5 (and marginally \noptimum using Pt = 0), although the power to detect effects of organics was greater  \n(74-79%). \nOur results show that, at least for UK RIVPACS samples, the estimate of O\/E ratio for \nnumber of taxa at moderately impacted sites has a tendency to increase as an increasing \nproportion of the least expected taxa are excluded from site assessments. Systematic changes \nin O\/E with Pt were also found by Hawkins et al. (2000), who concluded (p1466) that for \ntheir non reference quality test sites \u201con average O\/E50 overestimated O\/E0 with the amount \nof bias greatest at low O\/E50 values\u201d [O\/E50 and O\/E0 equate to Pt = 0.5  and Pt = 0.0]. As \nsites become stressed so sensitive taxa will become less abundant and eventually disappear \nfrom the site and samples. The taxa with the highest RIVPACS expected probabilities of \nbeing found in a sample will generally also be the most abundant at the site (if unstressed). \nTherefore, on average, the taxa with relatively low site-specific expected probabilities are \ngenerally likely to disappear first from the site and our sample counts as environmental stress \nincreases. This may be why ignoring and excluding such taxa from the calculation of O\/E \nratios by using a higher threshold Pt leads to values of O\/ETAXA declining less from unity. \nThis may be true as a generality, but the rate of loss of individual taxa depends on the \n 16\ntolerance to stress (or more specifically the actual type(s) of stress operating). Cao and \nHawkins (2005) used field data on reference and impacted test sites to derive stress tolerance \nvalues (TV) for individual taxa which they then used to simulate \u201ctrue\u201d changes in the \nabundances and occurrence of individual taxa with increasing levels of stress. They found \nfrom repeated simulations of  fixed count sub-samples, the true reduction in total taxa \nrichness at a site with stress was under-estimated; this was especially true for counts of 300 or \nless individuals. Cao and Hawkins (2005) cleverly explained this by showing that the \nevenness of the (simulated) abundances of taxa at a site increased with the level of stress, so \nthat a relative higher proportion of the taxa still present at a stressed site would be captured in \na fixed count sample. However, changes in evenness of taxa abundance with stress would not \nhave such an obvious impact on the observed sample taxa richness obtained by area- or time-\nbased sampling methods such as RIVPACS which aim to identify and include all of the taxa \nin a sample. This is discussed further below. \nIt is less obvious why O\/EASPT also tends to be higher at moderately stressed sites when \nbased on higher expected probability thresholds. One explanation could be that the families \nmost susceptible to organic pollution (with high BMWP scores) have, on average, much \nlower expected probabilities of occurrence than more tolerant families with low scores. \nIgnoring taxa with low expected probabilities would then tend to ignore the loss of these \nsensitive families and lead to higher estimates of O\/EASPT. To assess this, the BMWP families \nwere assigned to three classes (1-4, 5-7, 8-10) based on their BMWP score (1-10). Zero (i.e. \nto three decimal places) expected probabilities were excluded from the subsequent analyses \nbecause some families are naturally restricted to particular types of stream and hence \nnaturally excluded from a large proportion of the sites. In addition, only families with non-\nzero expected probabilities are involved in the calculation of the expected ASPT for a site. \nIncluding the large numbers of zero values would distort the frequency distributions. In the \nfirst approach the average expected probability of occurrence ( ip ) of each individual family i \nacross the 5752 GQA sites was calculated and then the (boxplot) distributions of the ip  for \nfamilies within each BMWP class were compared (Fig. 6). The median of the ip  for high-\nscoring (8-10) families was only 0.13, much lower than the median of 0.46 for the low-\nscoring organic-stress-tolerant families (Incidentally, not excluding zero expected \nprobabilities leads to a lower median ip  of 0.07 for the 8-10 scoring families and no change \n(to 2 d.p.) in the median for 1-4 scoring families). A second approach was based on \n 17\ncomparing the frequency distribution within the same dataset of all non-zero expected \nprobabilities of occurrence for all families within each BMWP class. Within each class of \nBMWP score, the percentages of all non-zero values of expected probability occurring in \neach of four classes of expected probability (<0.2, 0.2-0.5, 0.5-0.8, >0.8) were calculated and \ncompared (Table 7). For pollution sensitive families (BMWP scoring 8-10), 57% of all non-\nzero expected probabilities are less than 0.2, compared to only 27% for pollution tolerant \nfamilies (BMWP scoring 1-4). At the other extreme, only 5% of the expected probabilities for \npollution sensitive families were greater than 0.8, compared to 35% for the most tolerant \nclass of families (Table 7). Similar patterns in the expected probabilities were obtained when \nthe analysis was based on the RIVPACS reference sites. \nIt is clear that the families with high BMWP scores, considered to be the most sensitive to \norganic stress, do tend to have far lower expected probabilities of occurrence than the \npollution tolerant families with lower BMWP scores. The effect of this naturally occurring \nphenomenon is that site bioassessments involving O\/EASPT which exclude all families with \nlow site-specific expected probabilities tend to ignore the loss of these sensitive families and \nhence, give values of O\/EASPT which deviate less from reference. This effect is greatest at \nmoderately stressed sites because, at very poor quality sites with O\/EASPT less than 0.5, most \nof the families still present and found must be low scoring families, which generally have \nrelative high expected probabilities and thus are much less affected by the exclusion of \nfamilies with low site-specific expected probabilities. Similar effects of excluding taxa with \nlow expected probabilities may occur in other O\/E type indices based on other metrics \nincluding those designed to measure specific types of stress. \nOne possible explanation for the difference between our conclusions and those of some \nother studies (Hawkins et al., 2000; Ostermiller & Hawkins, 2004) on the perceived value of \nexcluding taxa with low site-specific expected probabilities could be the sampling method \nand, perhaps more importantly, the sample processing procedures used. In the UK RIVPACS \nstandardised procedures (Environment Agency, 1999), a 3 minute active kick sample with a \npond net of all habitats in proportion to their estimated occurrence is supplemented by a 1-\nmin hand search for taxa likely to be missed in the kick sample; this will extend the sample \ntaxa list and generally add less abundant taxa. Then in the laboratory, the whole sample is \ncarefully sorted with the aim of finding all of the taxa in the sample. In contrast, most other \nstudies of the factors influencing bioassessment accuracy have been based on sampling \nprotocols which involve sub-sampling, identifying and counting a \u2018random\u2019 fixed number of \n 18\nindividuals from the field sample. The AUSRIVAS procedure involves taking a random sub-\nsample and counting 200 individuals regardless of the total number of individuals in the field \nsample (Simpson & Norris, 2000). In their study, Ostermiller and Hawkins (2004) used fixed \ncounts of  random sub-samples of 50, 100, ... , 450 individuals. The abundance frequency \ndistributions of such random fixed count sub-samples are likely to have shorter tails (i.e. \ninclude proportionally fewer rare taxa present in low numbers) than the distributions obtained \nby searching through the whole sample to try to find all of the taxa present. One way to \nassess this idea would be to compare sampling\/processing protocols in terms of the relative \nfrequencies of  rare taxa in the sample counts (akin to the study of Cao and Hawkins (2005)). \nWith RIVPACS-type models, the percentage of all (non-zero) expected probabilities which \nare less than some small value could be calculated. For example, for the UK RIVPACS \nsampling protocol, 42% of all non-zero (to 3 d.p.) RIVPACS expected probabilities of \noccurrence are less than 0.2 (Table 7). We suggest that RIVPACS-type models based on \nsampling methods involving random sub-sampling of a fixed number of individuals are likely \nto contain a lower equivalent percentage of low expected probabilities because they tend to \ninclude less of the locally-rare taxa. In an analysis of 7-20 yr surber sample surveys of \nbenthic macroinvertebrates from 10 sites, Resh et al. (2005) found that 17-33% of taxa were \n\u2018rare\u2019 in that they only incurred in one year at any particular site. The abundance frequency \ndistribution (and more obviously, taxa richness) for a site, the field sample from it and the \nsubsequent laboratory (sub-)count can be quite different \u2013 this could have implications for \nmetric calculation and biases in estimates of changes in O\/E with stress. \nThis study has highlighted that the choice of expected probability threshold Pt influences both \nthe variability and effective scaling of O\/E indices above and below unity. Therefore O\/E \nindices based on different thresholds need to be treated as separate indices with different \neffective scales from the point of view of setting appropriate critical values of O\/E as quality \nor ecological status class boundaries. You need to compare like with like. \nFinally, for UK RIVPACS, using a threshold expected probability Pt for exclusion of \nbetween 0.0 and 0.2 appears to provide the best overall compromise solution and marginally \nhighest statistical power to detect impacts; although power was very similar for thresholds up \nto 0.5. Moreover, our analyses provide no support for switching the standard assessment of \nriver sites based on the UK RIVPACS model and UK RIVPACS sampling procedures from \nthe current approach of basing O\/E values on all of the taxa (i.e. Pt =0) to a system based on \nonly involving taxa with site-specific expected probabilities of 0.5 or more. \n 19\n  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe 1995 General Quality Assessment (GQA) data was provided by the Environment Agency \nof England and Wales.
