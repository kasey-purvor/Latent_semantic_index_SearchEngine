The role of Stokes phenomenon in describing the asymptotic\nbehaviour of an analytic function as its argument tends to an isolated singularity has\nbeen studied intensively in recent years (Berry [1], Berry and Howls [3], McLeod [4],\nMeyer [5], Olde Daalhuis and O1ver [8], O1ver [10], Paris [12], Paris and Wood [13]).\nAs originally discussed by Stokes, the basic picture is that an asymptotic expansion of\nthe function that is uniform in phz can be constructed only if an exponentially small\ncorrection (in terms of distance from the singularity) is made as certain directions are\ntraversed in the Argand diagram. These directions are called Stokes lines, and when\nthe function under consideration is a complementary function of a certain class of linear\nholomorphic second-order differential equations, they are characterised as lines where\none complementary function is maximally dominant over another. The Stokes lines are\nseparated by other directions, called anti-Stokes lines, which are practically important\nbecause, across them, a complementary function switches from being dominant to\nsubdominant; however, there is no nonuniformity in their vicinity, and all the action\ntakes place near the Stokes lines.\nWhat has emerged recently is the detailed structure of the behaviour in the vicin-\nity of Stokes lines, at least for a class of functions whose asymptotic expansions diverge\nin a certain way. Thus, instead of the traditional asymptotic representation in terms\nof divergent expansions in different sectors, with discontinuous coefficients that are\nrelated by the Stokes connection formulae, the smoothness inherent in the analyticity\ncan be restored, and this can be done universally in terms of error functions [1].\nThe purpose of this paper is to interpret this state of affairs in terms of theory\nof matched expansions (MAEs) (van Dyke [14]), not just with the aim of simplifying\nthe representation of the above-mentioned new developments but also to pave the way\nfor these developments to be exploited in problems other than the linear ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) that have been considered hitherto.\nTo fix ideas, we will begin by recalling Stokes phenomenon for some linear ODEs\nwhere there are explicit integral representations. These examples will then be used\n*Received by the editors January 19, 1994; accepted for publication (in revised form) October\n31, 1994.\nMathematical Institute, University of Oxford, 24-29 St. Giles, Oxford OX1 3LB, United\nKingdom.\n:Department of Theoretical Mechanics, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD,\nUnited Kingdom.\n1469\n1470 OLDE DAALHUIS CHAPMAN KING OCKENDON TEW\nto motivate the construction of the MAE framework with which we will be working.\nIt will first enable us to study the relevance of the phenomenon for a class of linear\nhomogeneous ODEs in order to explain how to decide when connection formulae can\nbe calculated explicitly rather than by numerical computation. Then we use the MAE\nformat to present new results concerning the asymptotic behaviour of inhomogeneous\nODEs. Finally, in the conclusion, we will be able to make some conjectures about\nthe applicability of our framework to other ODEs and partial differential equations\n(PDEs).\nA crucial aspect of our approach is the reinterpretation of Stokes phenomenon in\nterms other than that of maximal dominance of complementary functions of ODEs.\nOne interpretation that emerges naturally from Berry [I] is that of the rapidity with\nwhich the difference between the solution of an ODE and its optimally truncated\nasymptotic expansion varies as ph varies. This is tied in with the description of\nStokes phenomenon not as a change in the coecient of a complementary function\nbut rather as a change in the remainder of the asymptotic expansion of the dominant\ncomplementary function in the region where this remainder is comparable with the\nsubdominant complementary function. This remainder or error will have relatively\nsmooth variation away from a Stokes line, and the change traditionally ascribed to\nthe Stokes multiplier is a aqa of the rapid variation in this error rather than\nits cause. However, yet another characterisation has been proposed by Wright [15]\nin terms of the equality of the phase of certain solutions of linear PDEs when inter-\npreted as waves, and this is the one that will emerge most naturally as a result of our\ninvestigation.\n. Examp|e The complementary error function. The complementary\nror function s a well-known function defined by\n(2.1) erfc(z) e dr, z C.\nIt is an entire function with the following asymptotic behaviour:\n(2.2a) erfc(z) e- (2s)l 3z 0(-1) sl(4z2) ]Ph(z)l < w\u2019\ne (2s) 3\n rfc( ) + <\ns0\nas [z[\n--\ncx. Notice that both asymptotic expansions are valid in the sector 7r <\nphz < }7r. So the asymptotic behaviour of erfc(z) is the infinite expansion of (2.2a),\nplus a constant. In the sector\n-r < phz < r, where exp(-z2)\/zv\/- is subdominant,\nthis constant is 0. In the sector r < phz < 7r, where, again, exp(-z2)\/Zv\/- is sub-\ndominant, this constant is 2. And in the sector r < phz < r, where exp(-z)\/zx\/\nis dominant, this constant changes from 0 to 2 (see Fig. 2.1).\nWe want to obtain the change of the asymptotic behaviour directly from the\ndifferential equation\nd2 d\nw+ o,\nwithout use of (2.1). Both erfc(z) and the constant function are solutions of this\ndifferential equation. To obtain more information on the change in the sector 1\/47r <\nSTOKES PHENOMENON AND MATCHED ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS 1471\nexp\nFIG. 2.1. The asymptotic behaviour of erfc(z) for 0 <_ phz <_ r.\nphz < }r, we truncate (2.2a) after N terms:\n(2.4) erfc(z) e- (-1) s!(4z2)----- + RN(Z).ZV\/\ns=0\nThe remainder RN(Z) is a solution of\nd2 e-z (--1)N(2N)!\ndz2 RN(Z) + 2z RN(Z) zx\/ (N- 1)!4N-lz2N\"\nTo show where the significant changes take place, we introduce polar coordinates\n(2.6)\nd ie\n-\nd d2 ie\n-\nd e\n-\nd\nz rei, O < O < Tr, dz r dO\u2019 dz2 r2 dO r2 dO2\u2019\nwhere we have deliberately written z in terms of the \"fast\" variable 0 rather than\nthe \"slow\" variable r.

Therefore, we take N r2 + a, where a is bounded as r c. With this N\nthe right-hand side of (2.7) reads\n(2.8)\nexp[-r2(e2i + i(20 7r)) + aTri (2a + 1)Oi](2r + 2a)!\nV(r2 + a 1)!4r+a-lr2r+2+1\n8r\ne-(-)-exp[-r(e + 1 + i(20- ))1\nas r\n-\nc. The dominant factor in the right-hand side of (2.8) is lexp[-r2(e2i d- 1 +\ni(20 r))]l, and it is maximal at 0 1\/27r, where it is O(1), as r\n--\nxz. The value\n0 1\/2r has two other special properties. First, the phase of the second exponential\nis both zero and stationary at this point (so that the right-hand side ceases to be\noscillatory as r\n-\ncxz in the vicinity of the Stokes line). Second, and most importantly\n1472 OLDE DAALHUIS CHAPMAN, KING, OCKENDON, TEW\nfor the present point of view, the right-hand side of (2.8) is independent of c when\n0 Tr. This latter property allows us to use matched asymptotic expansions to solve\nfor RN in the neighbourhood of the Stokes line. We write\nro 1(2.9) r=-- 0= 7r+500,\nwhere e and 5 are the new small parameters. With the substitution of (2.9) into (2.7),\nwe obtain\nas 5, e\n--\n0. From the final exponential we only obtain an interesting result when\n5 e. Then the dominant terms are the e-1 terms, and we obtain\n(2.11) dOot:tN(Z) 4exp(_2r00),VzTr\nwith the solution\nro 1\/2r+eOo)(2.12) IN(Z) A + erf(v\/roOo), z --e\u2019(\n--\nO,\nwhere erf(z) is the error function. Matching as 00 --, -oc, the remainder Rw(z) is\nexponentially small. Thence, A 1. Thus all the change in the constant term takes\nplace in the neighbourhood of the Stokes line phz 1\/27r, and the change reads\n(2.13) RN(Z) 1 + erf(Vr000),\nin agreement with [1]. Figure 2.2 shows the appearance of the constant term in the\nasymptotic behaviour of erfc(z) in the sector 0 _< phz _< 2r. Notice that the constant\n5term appears at the Stokes line phz Tr, it is dominant in the sector Tr < phz < Tr,\nand it disappears at the Stokes line phz Tr.\nSTOKES PHENOMENON AND MATCHED ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS 1473\n3. The Stokes phenomenon for solutions of a class of ODEs. The general\nhomogeneous linear differential equation of the second order is given by\n(3.1) d\n2 d\n+ + o.\nWe suppose that the point at infinity is an irregular singularity of rank 1. The asymp-\ntotic theory of solutions of (3.1) in these circumstances is well known and will be\nfound, for example, in Olver [9, Chap. 7, 1-2]. Without loss of generality we may\nassume that f(z) and g(z) can be expanded in the power series\n(3.2) f(z) 1- p + 2- g(z) E g8Z Z\n-\n8\"-\u20192\nwhich converge for Izl >_ p.

A direct consequence of (3.2) is that Vl (Ze-27ri) is also a solution of (3.1), and\nnote that vl(z) and e2\"Vl(ze-2i) are dominant solutions in the sector 1\/27r + <\n3phz < Tr- and have exactly the same asymptotic expansion there. Thus there is\na Stokes multiplier C such that\nVl (Z) e27riPvl (ZC-2r{ -}- CV2(Z).\nWith this connection formula we obtain the following asymptotic behaviour for vl (z)\u2019\n1 1(3.6a) Vl(Z) e-zz -Tr < phz < r, subdominant2\n1 3(3.65) v (z) e-zz, r < phz < 7r, dominant,\n3 5(3.6c) v(z) C, r < phz < Tr, dominant.\n3Again, somewhere in the sector gr < phz < -, new exponentially small terms\nappear.

We note that, had we not assumed the expansions (3.2) (which can be\nachieved by a transformation of the general equation (3.1)) but worked with (3.1)\ndirectly with general f and g, then it would have been necessary to write RN Sv,\nwhere v2 is the leading-order behaviour of v2, and formulate the equation for the Stokes\nmultiplier S. In the case considered, v 1 and RN S. Note also, however, that the\nStokes lines can be determined from the condition that the right-hand side of (3.10)\nis independent of , for which it is not necessary to know the leading-order behaviour\nof the solution v2 that is to be \"switched on.\" Indeed, the leading-order behaviour of\nthis second function can then be deduced; i.e., given only the asymptotic expansion of\nVl, both the Stokes lines and leading-order behaviour of v2 can be deduced without\nreference to the differential equation! In fact, for second-order equations that have\nsolutions\ncn eirl\nVl zPl e_.\"yl zk E zkn\nn-\"-O\nV2 Zlt2 e\"Y2\nwhere cn is real and positive, there are Stokes lines switching on v wherever eE is\nnc_l e_iv\" Of course, when we are dealing with second-real, and \"yl -\"y. limn__, cn\norder equations, it is much easier in general to determine the \"yi than the cn. However,\nfor higher-order equations, and in particular for PDEs, the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe solution to be switched on may not be known beforehand.\n4. The connection coefficient C. The result (3.9) describes the growth of\nthe coefficients of asymptotic expansion (3.3a), where A is a constant. At the end\nof the previous section we showed that A Ce-i\/27ri, where C is the constant in\nconnection formula (3.5). Thence\n(4.1) aN C(-1)N27ri e-F(N- #) as N\nSince we have the recurrence relation (3.4), we can use (4.1) for the numerical com-\nputation of C, but in general it is very difficult to obtain the value of C analytically.\nIndeed, only when (3.4) is simple enough for us to find aN analytically can (4.1) be\nused to obtain the exact value of C. For example, for the confluent hypergeometric\nfunctions, (3.4) is a two-term recurrence relation, but for these functions there are\nalso different methods (e.g., by integral representations) that can be used to obtain\nthe connection constants. There are, however, more complicated differential equations\nfor which the result (4.1) can be used to obtain the exact value of C. Consider the\nequation\n(4.2) d\n2\ndzv(z) + X + -z +\n-\nzV(Z) O\u2019\nwith the solutions\nVl (z) e-zz-1\n-, Iphz] <_ r- ,(4.3)\n=0\nThe recurrence relation for the coefficients can be written in the form a0 1, and for\ns>l\n(4.4) s(a, + 8as-l) =\/(as-1 -t-(8- 1)a_2),\n1476 OLDE DAALHUIS, CHAPMAN, KING OCKENDON TEW\nfrom which we obtain\n(4.5)\nHence, the constant C in\nis\nas (-1)ss!

An example is the differential equation for the Airy function Ai(z), namely,\nd2(4.7) dz.2 u(z) zu(z) O.\nThis differential equation is not of the form (3.1), but the transformation z x}\nleads to a differential equation of that form. From 3 we obtain that equation (4.7)\n2 4has Stokes lines at phz 0, 5rr, and 5rr. The Airy function Ai(z) is the subdominant\nsolution at phz 0. A second solution of (4.7) is Ai(ze-i), which is the subdominant\n2solution at phz 5rr. These two solutions have the following asymptotic behaviour:\n[ph(z)] < 9r- v,Ai(z)\n-e--z z\nAi(ze-i) ei\n(4.8) as Izl oo.\nIt is now possible to obtain the connection formula for Ai(z) just from (3.5) and the\nfact that Ai(z) is an entire function. From (3.5) we obtain that\n(4.9) Ai(z) e-1\/2iAi(ze-1) + CAi(ze-).\nA similar argument gives\n(4.10) Ai(z) C2Ai(ze) + e1\/2rAi(ze}ri).\nSince the Airy function is an entire function, we know that Ai(ze-) Ai(ze)\n4\nand that Ai(ze -) A](zei). Therefore, we obtain from (4.9) and (4.10) the\nconnection formula\n(4.11) Ai(z) e-1\/2iAi(zei) + e1\/2iAi(ze--i).\nFigure 4.1 shows the appearance of exponentially small terms in the asymptotic\nbehaviour of Ai(z) in the sector 0 _< phz _< 2r.\nFIG. 4.1. The appearance of exponentially small terms in the asymptotic behaviour of Ai(z).\nSTOKES PHENOMENON AND MATCHED ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS 1477\nRemark. In [9] the result (4.11) is obtained by the knowledge that there are\nconstants a, b, and c, not all zero, such that\n(4.12) aAi(z) + bAi(ze) + cAi(ze-i) 0.\nThe values of a, b, and c are obtained by looking at the asymptotic behaviour of the\nleft-hand side of (4.12) at the Stokes lines at phz 0, +gr. Alternatively, we can\nuse arguments involving the deformation of contour integral representations of Ai(z)\nto derive (4.11).\n5. An inhomogeneous differential equation. In this section we show that\nour matched asymptotics method also works for inhomogeneous differential equations.\nWe take as an example the differential equation\n(5.1) d\n2 d___w+ ez dz z xp(-z).\nThis is a rather special differential equation because the corresponding homogeneous\ndifferential equation (2.3) has an irregular singularity of rank 2 at infinity, which means\nthat the solutions growth like exp(p.(z)) as z oc, where p2(z) is a polynomial of\ndegree 2. Hence, there is a difference in the exponential growth of the solutions of\nthe corresponding homogeneous differential equation and the right-hand side of (5.1).\n(Compare [9, Chap. 7, 14].)\nThe general solution of (5.1) is of the form\nw(z) Aerfc(z) + B + Wp(Z),\nwhere A and B are arbitrary constants and wp(z) is a particular solution of (5.1). By\nvariation of parameters we find the two particular solutions\nFrom these integral representations we see that\n(5.4)\n1 1 5\nWp+ (Z)\n---e as Z --> O0 in r < phz < r,\n1 5 1\nWp_(Z)-e as z--oc in -7r<phz<\nWhen we substitute the formal solution e cs=0 asz into (5.1) we obtain\n1 1\n2\u2019 al --, 2as+l (1-2s)as+2(s-1)as_l+(s-2)(s-1)as_2, s >_ 1.\nIt is not difficult to show that\no 5E as -r < phz <\/() -z ;, ,,\n8--0\nas 5 1\nWp_ (z) e\n-,\n-7r < phz <\n1E.g., by using the method that is used in [9, Chap. 7, 14].\n1478 OLDE DAALHUIS, CHAPMAN KING, OCKENDON, TEW\nas z\n--\nx and that2\n(5.7) aK(-1)F(s)\nas s\n--\nc, where K is a constant.\nA direct consequence of (5.3b) is the connection formula\n(z) Wp_ (z) + --Te-1\/4 erfc(z).Wp+\nWith this connection formula we obtain the following asymptotic behaviour for Wp+ (z):\n1 1 3\n4r < phz < ,\n1 a 5(5.9b) wp+ (z)-e-,\n-r4 < phz < r,\nv\/ e z2 5 7(5.9c) Wp+(Z)\n---e 4 z < phz < ,\nsubdominant,\ndominant,\ndominant.3\nHence, somewhere in the sector r < phz < -}r, new exponentially small terms\nappear. Again, we write\nN-1\n(5.10) Wp+ (z) e-z E a-A + RN(Z)Z8\n8--0\nand, with the method of 4, we obtain\n(5.11) (1)--Rg(z) iKv\/2\u2019oexp -ro0\nwhere z (ro\/e)exp(i(7 + v0o)) and N (ro\/e) +\/,\/ bounded.

When\n00 --* +ec, we obtain that 2K7i 1\/47de-1\/4erfc(z) 1\/27ie 1\/4 and thus K e-z.\nTherefore, the change in the neighbourhood of the Stokes line phz is given by\nri [1+ erf(001_ )1t N(Z) ro\nWe now encounter a major obstacle that confronts efforts to generalise the results of\n3. We were able to use our MAE method in the sector 1\/47 < phz < for the very\nreason that the minimal remainder RN(z) is of the same order as erfc(z) as z\nHowever, since in the sector\n-r <: phz < r the minimal remainder RN(Z) is expo-\nnentially large compared with erfc(z), we cannot use our MAE method to determine\n2E.g., by using the method that is used in [11].\n3In the derivation of (5.9c) we use that all solutions of (5.1) are entire functions such that (5.6b)\nis also valid for }r < phz < 1\/4r.\nSTOKES PHENOMENON AND MATCHED ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS 1479\nwhere and how the function erfc(z) is switched on in this section. Hence, it is still\nan open problem what the Stokes smoothing in the sector\n-Tr < phz < Tr should\nbe. In this connection, we note that inhomogeneous second-order equations are inti-\nmately linked with homogeneous third-order equations. Indeed, differentiating (5.1)\nand eliminating the inhomogeneous terms yields a holomorphic third-order differential\nequation for w.\nThe failure to detect the other Stokes lines in the example above is due to the\ninformation about them being \"swamped\" by the information about the Stokes line\nthat we were able to find. Such a situation will occur generically whenever two diver-\ngent asymptotic series are multiplied together. Consider, for example, the function\nv(z) E1 (Z)E1 (--Z), where E1 is the exponential integral. Since Jl has a Stokes line\nat phz r, v(z) will have Stokes lines at phz 0 and phz 7r. Asymptotically\nexpanding v(z), we have\nv(z)\n--l ( -. J! ) ( (-1)kk!zj=O k=O\nwhere c (2n + 1)!\/(n + 1), c2n+l 0. Hence, in this case, the leading-order\nbehaviour of the c\u2019s contains the information for both Stokes lines. However, if we\nconsider instead the function\n(J\u2019)( (-1)k\u2019) o cn\n--\nZk znj=l k--0\nthen c, (n + 1)!\/(n + 2)- (-)n!\/(n\ncontains no indication of the Stokes line at phz\nThings are even worse when the value of n corresponding to optimal truncation\ndiffers for the two series. Consider, for example, the function v(z) El(z)erfc(z).\nThen\nj=0 k=0\nAgain, c n! as n oc. However, whereas in the example above the second Stokes\nline could have been detected by considering the second term in the expansion of\nc, for large n, in this case the largest term corresponding to the tail of the asymp-\ntotic expansion of the error function to appear in the asymptotic expansion of c is\n((- 1) } n!)\/( !2), which is exponentially smaller than the leading-order behaviour of\nCrt.\nWe note that all of the examples given above are all solutions of homogeneous\nfourth-order holomorphic differential equations. Thus, for the solutions of inhomo-\ngeneous second-order equations and third- and higher-order homogeneous equations,\none of the Stokes lines will be easy to detect from the leading-order behaviour as\nn\n-\noc of the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of a solution, but the informa-\ntion about the other Stokes lines may be buried deep in the asymptotic expansions of\nthese coefficients.\n6. Discussion and conclusion. Using the format of matched asymptotic ex-\npansions, we have presented as unified an account as possible for the location of the\nStokes lines of certain analytic functions and for the description of the asymptotic\nbehaviour in the vicinity of these lines. When the functions satisfy certain ODEs, the\n1480 OLDE DAALHUIS, CHAPMAN, KING, OCKENDON, TEW\nlocal behaviour of IN(Z), the error in the optimally truncated asymptotic expansion\nof the dominant solution, is affected by the dependence of N on z and the precise\ngrowth of an as defined in (3.3a) for r > N. This behaviour is characterised by ex-\npressions such as (2.13) and (3.4), where both the argument of the error function and\nalso the region over which ftx(z) varies rapidly depend crucially on the properties of\nN and an: this region is wedge shaped in 2 but can, for example, be parabolic in the\ncases such as those considered in [10].\nFor the problems considered in 3, we have presented a systematic procedure\nfor determing the requisite information about _Rx(z); in many cases this involves the\nnumerical solution of the recurrence relation (3.4) (see [11]), and it seems likely that a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a closed formula for the Stokes\nmultipliers is that a closed-form solution exists for (3.4). However, any attempt to\napply our method to higher-order or inhomogeneous generalisations of those in 3 is\nbedeviled by the possibility of there being a hierarchy of Stokes lines. Hence it is\nappropriate to conclude with a summary of the different characterisations of Stokes\nlines that are available with the aim of highlighting those which are likely to be of\nmost value for more general problems.\nBy focusing on the remainder IN(Z), we have been able to assert that on a Stokes\nline\n(i) (3.10) is maximal;\n(ii) the phase of (3.10) and its 0-derivative are independent of r;\n(iii) (3.10) is independent of .\nMoreover, the discussion at the end of 3 has shown that (iii) above can sometimes\nallow us to identify Stokes lines directly from the asymptotic expansion of a function\nwithout reference to any differential equation. However, reverting to the examples\nin 3, we can consider what would have happened to (3.10) had we not made the\nassumption (3.2). Then, after transforming in accordance with the remark after (3.14),\nthe right-hand side of (3.8) would have involved a factor exp(l-.-Il-21), where\nthe phases ui are such that vi exp(ui) as Izl-+ oc. Hence, on the Stokes line\n(iv) R(ul)-R(u2) is maximal when considered as a function of 0 on r constant;\niv)\nThis last characterisation coincides with the definition of Stokes phenomenon\ngiven by Wright [15] in his Fourier analysis of linear wave propagation (see also Berry\nand Howls [2]). Indeed, if it is possible to write a wave field in the frequency domain as\na Fourier integral, then it is clear that a new wave is switched on whenever a steepest\ndescent path crosses a singularity or a new stationary point, in which case (iv) and\n(9) are clearly satisfied. In this spirit we can, if we consider holomorphic functions\nof two complex variables, give a physical interpretation of Stokes phenomenon that is\nquite different from the consideration of remainders in asymptotic expansions and is\nin the spirit of Meyer [6].\nSuppose a solution of Helmholtz\u2019s equation, say, with large wavenumber \/ is\napproximated using ray theory in two dimensions. The associated rays will, in general,\nbe both real and complex; while it is a simple matter to trace the phase and amplitude\nalong real rays, the same is not true for complex rays, which are best thought of as two-\ndimensional manifolds in the four-dimensional complexified space of the independent\nvariables. On these complex manifolds, the amplitude can vary by exponentially large\namounts in terms of k, a typical situation being near a caustic. On the bright side of\na caustic there are two families of real rays, and on the dark side there is one family of\ncomplex rays carrying exponentially small amplitude. However, an exponentially large\namplitude wave field could also exist on the dark side in principle, and some rule has to\nSTOKES PHENOMENON AND MATCHED ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSIONS 1481\nbe prescribed for legislating against complex rays carrying such large amplitude. Now\nit is natural to characterise Stokes \"surfaces\" as those points of C2 where two rays can\nexist with equal \"phases\" (i.e., the respective waves are exp(ikuj), where Rul Ru.).\nThese points form a three-dimensional manifold across which exponentially small wave\nfields can be switched on or off as in 2. The details of the generalisation of that\ndiscussion to this higher dimensional situation are too complicated to give here, but\nit is clear that the information that a complex ray carries en route to real space is\nprofoundly affected by what happens at the intersection of that ray with the Stokes\nsurface. This is exactly analogous to the change of dominance that occurs on anti-\nStokes lines being profoundly affected by what happened at a remote Stokes line.\nHence a knowledge of the position of the Stokes surface and the switching rules that\napply across it are vital if complex rays are to be of practical value. Incidentally, the\nconnection formulae for any point of the Stokes surface emanating from a caustic can\nbe read from an argument similar to that leading to (4.11); locally, near the caustic,\nthe wavefield is, of course, described by an Airy function.\nWe conclude by mentioning that there has also been much recent research on the\neffect of nonlinearity on Stokes phenomenon (see, e.g., Novokshenov [71). Although\nnonlinear connection formulae exist, say, for Painlev II, they seem never to have been\nanalysed by MAEs; indeed, it seems possible that nonlinearity may completely swamp\nthe delicate switching of exponentially small terms that underlies Stokes phenomenon.\nAppendix.
