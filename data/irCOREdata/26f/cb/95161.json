[23] and [24]) was considered when driven by an exponential Brownian\nmotion. We consider the same stochastic game, which we call the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev\nstochastic game, but driven by a spectrally negative Le\u00b4vy process and for a wider\nparameter range. Unlike [15], we do not appeal predominantly to stochastic an-\nalytic methods. Principally, this is due to difficulties in writing down variational\ninequalities of candidate solutions on account of then having to work with non-\nlocal integro-differential operators. We appeal instead to a mixture of techniques\nincluding fluctuation theory, stochastic analytic methods associated with martin-\ngale characterisations and reduction of the stochastic game to an optimal stopping\nproblem.\nKey words: Stochastic games, optimal stopping, pasting principles, fluctuation\ntheory, Le\u00b4vy processes.\nMSC(2000) Primary 60J99; secondary 60G40, 91B70\n1 Introduction\nLet X = {Xt : t \u2265 0} be a Le\u00b4vy process defined on a filtered probability space\n(\u2126,F ,F,P), where F = {Ft : t \u2265 0} is the filtration generated by X which is\nnaturally enlarged (cf. Definition 1.3.38 of [5]). For x \u2208 R, denote by Px the\nlaw of X when it is started at x and write simply P0 = P. Accordingly, we\nshall write Ex and E for the associated expectation operators. We shall assume\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nPreprint 4 December 2007\nthroughout that X is spectrally negative, meaning here that it has no positive\njumps and that it is not the negative of a subordinator. It is well known that\nthe latter allows us to talk about the Laplace exponent \u03c8(\u03b8) := logE[e\u03b8X1 ]\nfor \u03b8 \u2265 0, which will be of frequent use in the sequel. The Laplace exponent\nnecessarily takes the form\n\u03c8(\u03b8) = a\u03b8 +\n1\n2\n\u03c32\u03b82 +\n\u222b\n(\u2212\u221e,0)\n(e\u03b8x \u2212 1\u2212 x\u03b81{x>\u22121})\u03a0X(dx),\nwhere a \u2208 R, \u03c3 \u2265 0 is the Gaussian coefficient and \u03a0X is a measure concen-\ntrated on (\u2212\u221e, 0) satisfying \u222b(\u2212\u221e,0)(1\u2227x2)\u03a0X(dx) <\u221e. The reader is referred\nto Bertoin [4] for a complete introduction to the theory of Le\u00b4vy processes.\nDenote by T0,\u221e the family of all [0,\u221e]-valued stopping times with respect to\nF. We are interested in establishing a solution to a special class of stochastic\ngames which are driven by spectrally negative Le\u00b4vy processes. Specifically, for\na given q > 0 and \u03b4 > 0, we study the stochastic game consisting of two\nplayers and expected pay-off given by\nMx(\u03c4, \u03c3) := Ex\n[\ne\u2212q\u03c4+(x\u2228X\u03c4 )1{\u03c4\u2264\u03c3, \u03c4<\u221e} + e\u2212q\u03c3\n(\nex\u2228X\u03c3 + \u03b4eX\u03c3\n)\n1{\u03c3<\u03c4}\n]\n(1)\nfor x \u2265 0 where X t = sups\u2264tXs denotes the running supremum of X and\nwhere a\u2228 b = max(a, b). The inf-player\u2019s objective is to choose some \u03c3 \u2208 T0,\u221e\nwhich minimises (1), whereas the sup-player chooses some \u03c4 \u2208 T0,\u221e which\nmaximises this quantity. Our aim is to prove the existence of a saddle point\n(\u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3\u2217) such that\nMx(\u03c4, \u03c3\n\u2217) \u2264Mx(\u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3\u2217) \u2264Mx(\u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3)\nfor all \u03c4, \u03c3 \u2208 T0,\u221e and for all x \u2265 0. The pair (\u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3\u2217) is also known as a Nash\nequilibrium (cf. Ekstro\u00a8m and Peskir [9] and Peskir [20]). When such a pair of\nstopping times exists, we say that it solves the stochastic game (1) and we\ndenote the corresponding value by\nV (x) =Mx(\u03c4\n\u2217, \u03c3\u2217)\nfor x \u2265 0.\nNote that we have included the indicator 1{\u03c4<\u221e} in (1) since e\u2212qt+(x\u2228Xt) may\nnot be well defined for t =\u221e.\nWhen q = 0, this issue does not occur since ex\u2228Xt is monotone in t, and in\nthis case we are interested in the saddle point to the stochastic game which,\nfor a given \u03b4 > 0, has expected pay-off given by\nMx(\u03c4, \u03c3) = Ex\n[\nex\u2228X\u03c41{\u03c4\u2264\u03c3} +\n(\nex\u2228X\u03c3 + \u03b4eX\u03c3\n)\n1{\u03c3<\u03c4}\n]\n. (2)\n2\nThe game (1) was solved for q > \u03c8(1) \u2265 0 (under an extra technical assump-\ntion on the parameters) for a Brownian motion in [15]. In some sense, that\ncase is easier, since for a Brownian motion we can use standard Ito\u02c6 calculus\nand general theory of optimal stopping to show that a solution to a related free\nboundary problem (with a differential operator) also solves the game (1). The\nsolution to this free boundary problem is readily found in terms of exponential\nfunctions. For a Le\u00b4vy process with jumps, the corresponding free boundary\nproblem seems more difficult to solve directly (or even to establish existence\nof a solution), as it involves an integro-differential operator. Instead, we use\na mixture of fluctuation theory, martingale techniques and reduction of the\nstochastic game to an optimal stopping problem to solve (1). As a by-product,\nwe find that a technical assumption in [15] is not needed, see Remark 19.\nWhen \u03c8(1) = q > 0, the stochastic game (1) can be understood to characterise\nthe risk neutral price of a so-called game option in a simple market consisting\nof a risky asset the value of which is given by {eXt : t \u2265 0} and a riskless asset\nwhich grows at rate q (cf. [12]). The latter game option is an American-type\ncontract with infinite horizon which offers the holder the right but not the\nobligation to claim ex\u2228X\u03c4 at any stopping time \u03c4 \u2208 T0,\u221e, but in addition,\nthe contract also gives the writer the right but not the obligation to force\na payment of ex\u2228X\u03c3 + \u03b4eX\u03c3 at any stopping time \u03c3 \u2208 T0,\u221e; that is to say,\nwhat the holder would claim at that moment plus a penalty proportional to\nthe current value of the asset. However, in this paper we do not discuss the\nrelevance of the stochastic games (1) and (2) in the context of mathematical\nfinance.\nThe stochastic games (1) and (2) are closely related to the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev\noptimal stopping problem\nU(x) = sup\n\u03c4\u2208T0,\u221e\nE[e\u2212q\u03c4+(x\u2228X\u03c4 )1{\u03c4<\u221e}], (3)\nwhich characterises the value of a perpetual Russian option (cf. [23] and [24])\nin the Brownian case and [2] for the Le\u00b4vy case). See also [6], [8] and [18] for\nthe finite expiry case and [11] for a linear programming approach. Indeed, if it\nis the case that the stochastic saddle point in (1) is achieved at \u03c3 =\u221e, then it\nholds that U = V . In the article [24], an idea which is instrumental in helping\nprovide the solution to (3), is to change measure from P to the measure P1,\nwhere\ndP\u03bb\ndP\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223Ft = e\u03bbXt\u2212\u03c8(\u03bb)t (4)\ndefines an equivalent measure on {Ft : t \u2265 0} for any \u03bb \u2265 0. Under P\u03bb, the\nprocess X still belongs to the class of spectrally negative processes and its\nLaplace exponent is given by\n\u03c8\u03bb(\u03b8) = \u03c8(\u03b8 + \u03bb)\u2212 \u03c8(\u03bb) for \u03b8 \u2265 \u2212\u03bb. (5)\n3\n(For the latter conclusion it is important that F is naturally enlarged as\nopposed to satisfying the usual conditions, see the discussion on p164\u2013168\nof [5]). The effect of the change of measure is to reduce the dimension of\nthe underlying driving Markov process of (3) from three to two. That is to\nsay, the driving source of randomness changes from {(t,Xt, X t) : t \u2265 0} to\n{(t, (x \u2228 X t) \u2212 Xt) : t \u2265 0}. The Shepp\u2013Shiryaev optimal stopping problem\ncan be solved whenever it is possible to solve\nU(x) = sup\n\u03c4\u2208T0,\u221e\nE1[e\u2212\u03b1\u03c4+Y x\u03c4 1{\u03c4<\u221e}],\nwhere\n\u03b1 = q \u2212 \u03c8(1)\nand\nY x\u03c4 = (x \u2228X\u03c4 )\u2212X\u03c4 .\nThe same effect occurs when the change of measure is applied to (1) in the\ncase that q > 0 and thus the expected pay-off function of the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev\ngame can be rewritten as\nMx(\u03c4, \u03c3) = E1\n[\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03c4+Y\nx\n\u03c4 1{\u03c4\u2264\u03c3, \u03c4<\u221e} + e\u2212\u03b1\u03c3\n(\neY\nx\n\u03c3 + \u03b4\n)\n1{\u03c3<\u03c4}\n]\nwhen q > 0.\n(6)\nEstablishing the saddle point (\u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3\u2217) of (1) or equivalently (6) in the case q > 0\nand of (2) in the case q = 0, as well as establishing the value V (x) =M(\u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3\u2217)\nin both cases is what is meant by solving Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game. Note\nthat a saddle point may not be unique. The purpose of this paper is to give a\ncomplete study of the solution of the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game within\nthe specified parameter regime q \u2265 0 and \u03b4 > 0.\nIn the Brownian motion case, the finite horizon version of (1) (i.e. when both\nplayers have to choose stopping times valued in [0, T ] for some T > 0) was\nsolved in the preprint [13] preceding [14] by decomposing it into two finite\nhorizon optimal stopping problems, just as was done for the McKean stochastic\ngame.\n2 The solution to the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game\nBelow, in Theorems 2, 3 and 4 we give a qualitative and quantitative exposition\nof the solution to (1). Before doing so, we need to give a brief reminder of\na class of special functions which appear commonly in connection with the\nstudy of spectrally negative Le\u00b4vy processes and indeed in connection with the\ndescription of the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game as given below. For each\nq \u2265 0 we introduce the functions W (q) : R \u2192 [0,\u221e) which are known to\n4\nsatisfy for all x \u2208 R and a \u2265 0\nEx[e\u2212q\u03c4\n+\na 1{\u03c4+a <\u03c4\u22120 }] =\nW (q)(x \u2227 a)\nW (q)(a)\n, (7)\nwhere\n\u03c4+a := inf{t > 0 : Xt > a} and \u03c4\u22120 = inf{t > 0 : Xt < 0}\n(cf. Chapter 8 of [16]). In particular, it is evident that W (q)(x) = 0 for all\nx < 0 and further it is known that W (q) is almost everywhere differentiable\non (0,\u221e), there is right-continuity at zero and\n\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u2212\u03b2xW (q)(x) dx =\n1\n\u03c8(\u03b2)\u2212 q (8)\nfor all \u03b2 > \u03a6(q), where \u03a6(q) is the largest root of the equation \u03c8(\u03b8) = q (of\nwhich there are at most two). For convenience, we write W instead of W (0).\nAssociated to the functions W (q) are the functions Z(q) : R \u2192 [1,\u221e) defined\nby\nZ(q)(x) = 1 + q\n\u222b x\n0\nW (q)(y) dy\nfor q \u2265 0. Together, the functions W (q) and Z(q) are collectively known as\nscale functions and predominantly appear in almost all fluctuation identities\nfor spectrally negative Le\u00b4vy processes. For example, it is also known that for\nall x \u2208 R and a, q \u2265 0,\nEx[e\u2212q\u03c4\n\u2212\n0 1{\u03c4+a >\u03c4\u22120 }] = Z\n(q)(x \u2227 a)\u2212 Z\n(q)(a)\nW (q)(a)\nW (q)(x \u2227 a). (9)\nWe shall henceforth assume that\nthe jump measure of X, \u03a0X , has no atoms when X has bounded variation.\nThen it is known from existing literature (cf. [16]) that W (q) \u2208 C1(0,\u221e) and\nhence Z(q) \u2208 C2(0,\u221e). For computational convenience we shall proceed with\nthe above assumption on X. Recall that X has bounded variation if and only\nif it can be written in the form Xt = dt\u2212 St for t \u2265 0 where {St : t \u2265 0} is a\ndriftless subordinator with jump measure \u03bd satisfying \u03bd(x,\u221e) = \u03a0X(\u2212\u221e,\u2212x)\n(and then must necessarily satisfy\n\u222b\n(0,\u221e)(1\u2227 x) \u03bd(dx) <\u221e) and d is a strictly\npositive constant which is referred to as the drift. In that case, it is also\nknown that W (q)(0) = 1\/d and otherwise, when X has unbounded variation,\nW (q)(0) = 0.\nFor comparison with the main contributions of this paper (Theorems 2, 3 and\n4), we review the solution to the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev optimal stopping problem\n(3), the essential part of which can be found in [2]. For convenience, we shall\n5\nfirst introduce a subclass of spectrally negative Le\u00b4vy processes. Denote by G\nthe general class of spectrally negative Le\u00b4vy processes and the subclass\nHq =\n{\nX \u2208 G :\n\u222b\n(\u2212\u221e,0)\n(1 \u2227 |x|)\u03a0X(dx) =\u221e or \u03c3 > 0\nor \u03c3 = 0,\n\u222b\n(\u2212\u221e,0)\n(1 \u2227 |x|)\u03a0X(dx) <\u221e and q < d\n}\nwhere we recall the constant d is the drift in the case of bounded variation\n(see the previous paragraph). Also needed is the following class of stopping\ntimes defined for all y \u2265 0 by\nT+y = inf{t > 0 : Y xt \u2265 y} and T\u2212y = inf{t > 0 : Y xt \u2264 y}.\nFinally, let us introduce the continuous function\nf(x) = Z(q)(x)\u2212 qW (q)(x), (10)\nwhich will play an important role in characterising optimal thresholds. Owing\nto the fact that W (q)(x) = e\u03a6(q)xW\u03a6(q)(x), where W\u03a6(q)(x) plays the role of\nW (x) under P\u03a6(q), we can differentiate f and easily deduce that, when q >\n\u03c8(1) \u2228 0, the function f is strictly decreasing to \u2212\u221e and hence within this\nregime\nk\u2217 := inf{x \u2265 0 : f(x) \u2264 0} \u2208 [0,\u221e).\nIn particular, when q > \u03c8(1) \u2228 0, k\u2217 = 0 if and only if X \u2208 G\\Hq. This\nfollows from the fact that Z(q)(0) = 1 and W (q)(0) = 0 unless X has bounded\nvariation in which case W (q)(0) = 1\/d.\nIn the sequel, when U is attained by a stopping time in T0,\u221e, we shall denote\nit by \u03c4 \u2217. That is to say, when it exists, \u03c4 \u2217 satisfies\nU(x) = E[e\u2212q\u03c4\u2217+(x\u2228X\u03c4\u2217 )1{\u03c4\u2217<\u221e}].\nTheorem 1 Let q \u2265 0.\n(i) When q \u2264 \u03c8(1) we have U(x) =\u221e which is not attained by any \u03c4 \u2208 T0,\u221e,\n(ii) when \u03c8(1) < q = 0\nU(x) = ex +\n1\n\u03a6(0)\u2212 1e\nx(1\u2212\u03a6(0)),\nfor x \u2265 0, which is not attained by any \u03c4 \u2208 T0,\u221e,\n(iii) when X \u2208 G\\Hq, then for x \u2265 0\nU(x) = ex and \u03c4 \u2217 = 0,\n6\n(iv) when q > \u03c8(1) \u2228 0 and X \u2208 Hq, then\nU(x) = exZ(q)(k\u2217 \u2212 x) and \u03c4 \u2217 = T+k\u2217 .\nProof. Cases (iii) and (iv) are contained in Theorem 2 in [2]. Suppose q \u2264\n\u03c8(1). Since supt\u22650 Y\nx\nt = supt\u22650((x\u2228X t)\u2212Xt) is P1-almost surely unbounded,\nthe sequence of stopping times {T+n }n\u2208N is P1-almost surely finite. Hence when\n\u03b1 \u2264 0,\nU(x) \u2265 E1[e\u2212\u03b1T\n+\nn +Y\nx\nT+n ] \u2265 en,\nwhich implies (i).\nSuppose \u03c8(1) < q = 0. Then by monotonicity of X\nE[ex\u2228X\u221e ] \u2265 sup\n\u03c4\u2208T0,\u221e\nE[ex\u2228X\u03c41{\u03c4<\u221e}] \u2265 sup\nt\u22650\nE[ex\u2228Xt ] = E[ex\u2228X\u221e ].\nAs \u03c8(1) < 0, it follows that \u03c8\u2032(0+) < 0 and hence by a well-known result for\nspectrally negative processes, X\u221e is exponentially distributed with parameter\n\u03a6(0) = sup{\u03b8 \u2265 0 : \u03c8(\u03b8) = 0} > 1 We thus we deduce (ii).\nNote that when X \u2208 G\\Hq it follows that\nq \u2265 d > 0 \u2228 (d +\n\u222b\n(\u2212\u221e,0)\n(ex \u2212 1)\u03a0X(dx)) = 0 \u2228 \u03c8(1)\nand hence the four cases in the above theorem constitute an exhaustive par-\ntition of the regime q \u2265 0 for the optimal stopping problem (3).\nNow, turning to the solution of the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game, it turns\nout that it is necessary to divide the regime q \u2265 0 into several sub-cases. We\npresent our main results accordingly.\nTheorem 2 (The case q = 0) When q = 0 the solution to the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev\nstochastic game (2) is given as follows:\n(i) when \u03c8(1) \u2265 0 we have for any \u03b4 > 0 that a saddle point is given by \u03c3\u2217 = 0\nand \u03c4 \u2217 =\u221e and hence V (x) = ex + \u03b4,\n(ii) when \u03c8(1) < 0 and (\u03a6(0)\u2212 1)\u03b4 > 1 we have that \u03c4 \u2217 = \u03c3\u2217 =\u221e and\nV (x) = ex +\n1\n(\u03a6(0)\u2212 1)e\nx(1\u2212\u03a6(0)),\nfor x \u2265 0,\n(iii) when \u03c8(1) < 0 and (\u03a6(0)\u2212 1)\u03b4 \u2264 1 we have \u03c4 \u2217 =\u221e, \u03c3\u2217 = T\u22120 and\nV (x) = ex + \u03b4ex(1\u2212\u03a6(0)).\n7\nTheorem 3 (The case 0 < q < \u03c8(1)) Suppose 0 < q < \u03c8(1). Let f be\ndefined as in (10).\nThe equation\nf(y) = 1, for y > 0 (11)\nhas a unique solution (which we denote by y\u2217). The solution to the Shepp\u2013\nShiryaev stochastic game (6) is given as follows.\n(i) If \u03b4 > Z(q)(y\u2217)\u2212 1 then\nV (x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3 e\nx + \u03b4 when x < a\u2217,\nexZ(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 x) when x \u2265 a\u2217,\nwhere 0 < a\u2217 < b\u2217 <\u221e satisfy\nZ(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217) = 1 + \u03b4e\u2212a\u2217 , (12)\nb\u2217 = a\u2217 + y\u2217. (13)\nA saddle point is given by \u03c3\u2217 = T\u2212a\u2217 and \u03c4 \u2217 = T\n+\nb\u2217 . Further, the function\nV (x) is monotone increasing and V (x)\u2212 ex is monotone decreasing.\n(ii) If \u03b4 \u2264 Z(q)(y\u2217) \u2212 1, then there exists a unique z\u2217 \u2208 (0, y\u2217] which satisfies\nZ(q)(z\u2217) = 1 + \u03b4 and then\nV (x) = exZ(q)(z\u2217 \u2212 x)\nand a saddle point is given by \u03c3\u2217 = T\u22120 and \u03c4\n\u2217 = T+z\u2217.\nTheorem 4 (The case q > 0 and q \u2265 \u03c8(1)) Let q > 0. Recall that z\u2217 is\nthe unique solution of Z(q)(z) = 1 + \u03b4 which always exists uniquely as Z(q) is\na strictly increasing function with Z(q)(0) = 1 and Z(q)(\u221e) = \u221e. Also, recall\nthat for q > 0 and X \u2208 Hq, the equation f(x) = 0 has a unique solution,\ndenoted by k\u2217. The solution to the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game (6) is given\nas follows.\n(i) When q = \u03c8(1) and \u03b4 > 0 we have \u03c3\u2217 = T\u22120 , \u03c4\n\u2217 = T+z\u2217 and\nV (x) = exZ(q)(z\u2217 \u2212 x),\n(ii) when q > \u03c8(1), X \u2208 Hq and \u03b4 > Z(q)(k\u2217) \u2212 1 (so that k\u2217 < z\u2217) we have\n\u03c3\u2217 =\u221e, \u03c4 \u2217 = T+k\u2217 and\nV (x) = U(x) = exZ(q)(k\u2217 \u2212 x),\n(iii) when q > \u03c8(1), X \u2208 Hq and \u03b4 \u2264 Z(q)(k\u2217) \u2212 1 so that k\u2217 \u2265 z\u2217 we have\n\u03c3\u2217 = T\u22120 , \u03c4\n\u2217 = T+z\u2217 and\nV (x) = exZ(q)(z\u2217 \u2212 x),\n8\n(iv) when q > \u03c8(1) and X \u2208 G\\Hq, we have for any \u03b4 > 0 that \u03c4 \u2217 = 0 and\n\u03c3\u2217 =\u221e form a saddle point, hence\nV (x) = ex.\nRemark 5 (Intuition) We briefly discuss some of the intuition behind the\nresults of Theorems 2, 3 and 4.\nWhen q = 0, one might expect it not to be optimal for the sup-player to stop,\nsince the gain in (2) is non-decreasing in time. One would also expect the\ninf-player to never stop when the penalty \u03b4 is too large, which is indeed the\nconclusion of Theorem 2 (ii). When \u03c8(1) \u2265 0 we have\nE[eXt\u2228x] \u2265 E[eXt ] = e\u03c8(1)t,\nwhich indicates that the inf-player cannot gain by waiting and hence should\nstop immediately. When \u03c8(1) < 0 and \u03b4 is below a critical value, it becomes\nworthwhile for the inf-player to stop. Since \u03c8(1) < 0 implies that E[eXt ] de-\ncreases in t, it might be lucrative for the inf-player not to stop immediately\nand it turns out that it is optimal for the inf-player to stop when the reflected\nprocess Y reaches its minimum 0. Note that this stopping time is infinite with\npositive probability.\nWhen q \u2265 \u03c8(1) and q > 0, we observe the same phenomenon that the inf-\nplayer stops when Y reaches 0 providing \u03b4 is below a critical value. This time,\nsince q > 0, the sup-player should stop as well in an almost surely finite\nstopping time and indeed this happens at the first time Y exceeds a certain\npositive value (possibly by a jump).\nWhen 0 < q < \u03c8(1), the discount factor \u03b1 in (6) is negative and therefore the\ninf-player should stop at an almost surely finite time. It also seems plausible\nthat the inf-player should stop sooner than when \u03c8(1) \u2264 q, resulting in an\noptimal stopping set of the form [0, a\u2217]. However, this only happens when the\npenalty \u03b4 is large enough. It might seem counterintuitive that the inf-player\nis more eager to stop when the penalty is large, but this strategy could be\nexplained by reasoning that the inf-player is tolerant to the negative discount\nfactor \u03b1 in (6) as long as \u03b4 is small enough. When \u03b4 becomes too large, the\ninf-player needs to take evasive action by stopping sooner.\nRemark 6 (Pasting conditions) Theorems 3 and 4 both state that the\nvalue function of the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game necessarily takes the\nform\nV (x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3 \u03b4 + e\nx when x < a,\nexZ(q)(b\u2212 x) when x \u2265 a,\nfor some 0 \u2264 a \u2264 b < \u221e. As a consequence of the behaviour at the origin of\n9\nthe scale functions Z(q) and W (q), if follows that when a > 0, there is smooth\npasting at a (in accordance with the fact that 0 is regular for (0,\u221e) for X).\nFurther, when b < \u221e there always is continuity at b and smooth pasting at\nb if and only if X has unbounded variation (corresponding to the case that 0\nis regular for (\u2212\u221e, 0) for X). See [1] for a discussion on the relevance of path\nregularity to pasting conditions.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section we make\nnote of a Verification Lemma for the optimal stopping game (6) under the\nchange of measure. This lemma essentially allows us to \u2018verify\u2019 directly that\nthe solutions presented in Theorems 3 and 4 are indeed optimal. In addition,\nwe present the candidate functions which will be used in conjunction with the\nVerification Lemma to establish the solution. In Section 4 we give the proof\nof Theorem 3. Having done this, one sees that the proof of Theorem 4 is a\nstraightforward variant of a part of the proof of Theorem 3. We only comment\nbriefly in Section 5 on the proof of Theorem 4, which is otherwise left as an\nexercise for the reader. In Section 6 we give the proof of Theorem 2. The proof\ndiffers from the proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 in the sense that one may no\nlonger appeal to the change of measure (4).\n3 Preliminary results\nFollowing classical ideas in optimal stopping, we verify that a candidate solu-\ntion solves the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev game by checking certain associated bounds\nand martingale properties. Specifically, we use the following verification lemma\nfor the case q > 0, which is a variant of the similar one in [3].\nLemma 7 (Verification Lemma) Suppose that \u03c4 \u2217 \u2208 T0,\u221e and \u03c3\u2217 \u2208 T0,\u221e\nare candidate optimal strategies for the stochastic game (6) such that\neY\nx\n\u03c3 1{\u03c3<\u03c4\u2217} (14)\nis uniformly bounded by a constant for all \u03c3 \u2208 T0,\u221e and x \u2265 0. Let\nV \u2217(x) = E1[e\u2212\u03b1\u03c4\u2217+Y x\u03c4\u22171{\u03c4\u2217\u2264\u03c3\u2217, \u03c4\u2217<\u221e} + e\u2212\u03b1\u03c3\n\u2217 (\neY\nx\n\u03c3\u2217 + \u03b4\n)\n1{\u03c3\u2217<\u03c4\u2217}].\nThen the triple (\u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3\u2217) is a saddle point to (6) if\n(i) V \u2217(x) \u2265 ex,\n(ii) V \u2217(x) \u2264 ex + \u03b4,\n(iii) V \u2217(Y\u03c4\u2217) = eY\u03c4\u2217 almost surely on {\u03c4 \u2217 <\u221e},\n(iv) V \u2217(Y\u03c3\u2217) = eY\u03c3\u2217 + \u03b4 almost surely on {\u03c3\u2217 <\u221e},\n(v) the process {e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2227\u03c4\u2217)V \u2217(Yt\u2227\u03c4\u2217)}t\u22650 is a right-continuous submartingale un-\nder P1 and\n10\n(vi) the process {e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2227\u03c3\u2217)V \u2217(Yt\u2227\u03c3\u2217)}t\u22650 is a right-continuous supermartingale\nunder P1.\nProof.

(15)\nFrom the supermartingale property (vi), Doob\u2019s optional stopping theorem\n(iv) and (i) we know that for any \u03c4 \u2208 T0,\u221e and t \u2265 0,\nV \u2217(x)\u2265E1[e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2227\u03c4\u2227\u03c3\u2217)V \u2217(Xt\u2227\u03c4\u2227\u03c3\u2217)]\n\u2265E1[e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2227\u03c4)+Y xt\u2227\u03c41{\u03c3\u2217\u2265t\u2227\u03c4, \u03c4<\u221e} + e\u2212\u03b1\u03c3\u2217(eY x\u03c3\u2217 + \u03b4)1{\u03c3\u2217<t\u2227\u03c4}].\nBy taking limits t\u2192\u221e, it follows from Fatou\u2019s lemma that\nV \u2217(x) \u2265 E1[\u0398\u03b1\u03c4,\u03c3\u2217 ].\nNext, we show that\nV \u2217(x) \u2264 E1[\u0398\u03b1\u03c4\u2217,\u03c3]. (16)\nIf \u03c3 is such that\nE1[e\u2212\u03b1\u03c31{\u03c3<\u03c4\u2217}] =\u221e,\nthen (16) holds trivially, as V \u2217(x) \u2264 \u221e. Hence, we assume \u03c3 \u2208 T0,\u221e satisfies\nE1[e\u2212\u03b1\u03c31{\u03c3<\u03c4\u2217}] <\u221e.\nUsing (v), Doob\u2019s optional stopping theorem, (ii) and (iii) we find\nV \u2217(x)\u2264E1[e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2227\u03c4\u2217\u2227\u03c3)V \u2217(Xt\u2227\u03c4\u2217\u2227\u03c3)]\n=E1[e\u2212\u03b1\u03c4\u2217V \u2217(X\u03c4\u2217)1{\u03c4\u2217\u2264t\u2227\u03c3} + e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2227\u03c3)V \u2217(Xt\u2227\u03c3)1{\u03c4\u2217>t\u2227\u03c3}]\n\u2264E1[e\u2212\u03b1\u03c4\u2217+Y x\u03c4\u22171{\u03c4\u2217\u2264t\u2227\u03c3} + e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2227\u03c3)(eY xt\u2227\u03c3 + \u03b4)1{\u03c4\u2217>t\u2227\u03c3}].\nTaking limits as t \u2191 \u221e and applying the monotone convergence theorem to\nthe first term on the right hand side and the dominated convergence theorem\n(see (14)) to the second term on the right hand side, we find that indeed\nV \u2217(x) \u2264 E1[\u0398\u03b1\u03c4\u2217,\u03c3]\nand hence the saddle point is achieved with the strategies (\u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3\u2217).\nNote that Lemma 7 implies that when \u03b4 \u2265 supx\u22650(U(x) \u2212 ex), a solution to\nthe game is given by taking V \u2217 = U and \u03c4 \u2217 as in Theorem 1 and \u03c3\u2217 =\u221e. This\nagrees with the intuition that the inf-player will force a greater payment by\nstopping than the sup-player would otherwise induce by stopping and hence\nit is better for the inf-player not to stop at all.\n11\nWe shall often apply the above verification lemma to solutions of the form\nV (x, a, b) for 0 \u2264 a < x < b < \u221e corresponding to taking strategies \u03c3 = T\u2212a\nand \u03c4 = T+b in (1).

Hence in either case of bounded or unbounded\nvariation, it follows that f(\u000f) < 1 for some \u000f > 0.\nRecalling that W (q)(x) = e\u03a6(q)xW\u03a6(q)(x), we have for x > 0\nf \u2032(x)= q(W (q)(x)\u2212W (q)\u2032(x))\n= qe\u03a6(q)x((1\u2212 \u03a6(q))W\u03a6(q)(x)\u2212W \u2032\u03a6(q)(x)).\nIt is also known that\nW \u2032\u03a6(q)(x) =W\u03a6(q)(x)n\u03a6(q)(h > x),\nwhere n\u03a6(q) is the excursion measure of X \u2212X under P\u03a6(q). Hence,\nf \u2032(x) = qW (q)(x)(1\u2212 \u03a6(q)\u2212 n\u03a6(q)(h > x)) (19)\nand thus, in particular, f(\u221e) = \u221e implying that the function f attains its\nminimum. From (19) it also follows that f \u2032(x) \u2265 0 for some x implies that\nf \u2032(y) > 0 for all y > x. From the first paragraph of this proof we deduce that\nthe minimum of f is valued in (\u2212\u221e, 1) and that this minimum is uniquely\nattained (say at m). We deduce that the equation f(y) = 1 has a unique\nsolution on (0,\u221e) (denoted by y\u2217). Clearly, y\u2217 > m and it readily follows that\nf \u2032(y\u2217) > 0 and that f(x) < 1 for all 0 < x < y\u2217.\nWe now show positivity of f . It is known from the Wiener\u2013Hopf factorisation\n(cf. Chapter 8 of [16]) that\n1\nq\n>\n1\nq\nP(\u2212Xeq \u2208 [0, x]) =\n1\n\u03a6(q)\nW (q)(x)\u2212\n\u222b x\n0\nW (q)(y) dy,\nwhere eq is an independent and exponentially distributed random variable\nwith parameter q and X t = infs\u2264tXs. Since 0 < q < \u03c8(1), it follows that\n\u2212\u03a6(q)\u22121 < \u22121 and hence\nf(x) > Z(q)(x)\u2212 q\n\u03a6(q)\nW (q)(x) = 1\u2212 q\n(\n1\n\u03a6(q)\nW (q)(x)\u2212\n\u222b x\n0\nW (q)(y) dy\n)\n> 0,\nwhich completes the proof.\nWe now divide the forthcoming analysis into the two cases \u03b4 > Z(q)(y\u2217)\u22121 and\n\u03b4 \u2264 Z(q)(y\u2217)\u2212 1 corresponding to parts (i) and (ii) respectively of Theorem 3.\n13\n4.1 The case \u03b4 > Z(q)(y\u2217)\u2212 1.\nUnder this sub-regime of 0 < q < \u03c8(1), we have the existence of 0 < a\u2217 <\nb\u2217 <\u221e satisfying\nZ(q)(y\u2217) = 1 + \u03b4e\u2212a\n\u2217\nand\nb\u2217 = a\u2217 + y\u2217,\nwhere y\u2217 was defined as the unique solution in (0,\u221e) of (11). Note that this\nchoice of a\u2217 and b\u2217 has the convenient implication that for x \u2265 a\u2217\nV (x, a\u2217, b\u2217) = exZ(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 x). (20)\nFrom the latter, we see that on [a\u2217, b\u2217)\nV (x, a\u2217, b\u2217) > ex.\nMoreover, V \u2032(x, a\u2217, b\u2217) = exf(b\u2217 \u2212 x) and, on account of the fact that f(b\u2217 \u2212\nx) < 1 for all x > a\u2217, it follows that\nV (x, a\u2217, b\u2217) < ex + \u03b4 for all x > a\u2217. (21)\nSince f is positive, it also follows that V (x, a\u2217, b\u2217) is increasing in x, and thus,\nin particular,\nea\n\u2217\n+ \u03b4 = V (a\u2217, a\u2217, b\u2217) < V (b\u2217, a\u2217, b\u2217) = eb\n\u2217\n. (22)\nNext, define the function \u03b8 : R 7\u2192 R by\n\u03b8(x) = Z(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 x)\u2212 1\u2212 \u03b4e\u2212x. (23)\nWe will shortly make use of the following lemma.\nLemma 10 The function \u03b8 satisfies \u03b8(a\u2217) = 0 and\n\u03b8(x) < 0 for all x < a\u2217.\nProof. The statement \u03b8(a\u2217) = 0 rephrases (12). Next, differentiating and\nusing the fact that b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217 = y\u2217 (and hence f(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217) = 1), we have\n\u03b8\u2032(a\u2217) = \u2212qW (q)(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217) + \u03b4e\u2212a\u2217 = 1\u2212 Z(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217) + \u03b4e\u2212a\u2217 = 0.\nFrom Lemma 9 we have f \u2032(y\u2217) > 0 and hence W (q)\u2032(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217) < W (q)(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217),\nwhich in turn implies that\n\u03b8\u2032\u2032(a\u2217) = qW (q)\u2032(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217)\u2212 \u03b4e\u2212a\u2217 < qW (q)(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217)\u2212 \u03b4e\u2212a\u2217 = 0. (24)\n14\nIn particular, \u03b8(x) < 0 for all x \u2208 (a\u2217\u2212\u03b5, a\u2217) and some sufficiently small \u03b5 > 0.\nSuppose now, for contradiction, that c = sup{x < a\u2217 \u2212 \u03b5 : \u03b8(x) = 0} > \u2212\u221e.\nThen by Rolle\u2019s theorem, there exists d \u2208 (c, a\u2217) such that \u03b8(d) < 0 and\n\u03b8\u2032(d) = 0. On the other hand, for x < a\u2217 we also have\n\u03b8(x) + \u03b8\u2032(x)= f(b\u2217 \u2212 x)\u2212 1\n>f(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217)\u2212 1 = 0,\nwhere we have used Lemma 9. In particular with x = d we find \u03b8(d) > 0 which\nis in contradiction with the definition of d. In conclusion, c = a\u2217 and \u03b8(x) < 0\nfor all x < a\u2217 as required.\nOur strategy for proving part (i) of Theorem 3 will be to look at an auxiliary\noptimal stopping problem and then use the above information to associate the\nsolution of the aforementioned optimal stopping problem with the solution of\nthe Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game. To this end, let\nI(x) = inf\n\u03c3\u2208T0,\u221e\nE1[e\u2212\u03b1\u03c3g(Y\u02dc x\u03c3 )], (25)\nwhere Y\u02dc x\u03c3 := Y\nx\n\u03c3\u2227T+\nb\u2217\n, g is any continuous function such that\ng(x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3 e\nx + \u03b4 when x < a\u2217,\nex when x \u2265 b\u2217\nand\nex + \u03b4 > g(x) > exZ(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 x)\nfor any x \u2208 (a\u2217, b\u2217).\nTheorem 11 There exists a solution to the optimal stopping problem (25)\nwith the following properties.\n(i) For x > a\u2217, I(x) = V (x, a\u2217, b\u2217).\n(ii) For all x \u2208 (0, b\u2217), I(x) > ex.\nProof. By taking \u03c3 = 0 in the expectation on the right hand side of (25), we\nsee that I(x) \u2264 (ex + \u03b4). Hence, it follows that\nI(x) = I(x) \u2227 (ex + \u03b4) = inf\n\u03c3\u2208T0,\u221e\nE1[(e\u2212\u03b1\u03c3g(Y\u02dc x\u03c3 )) \u2227 (ex + \u03b4)]\nand (25) is an optimal stopping problem for a strong Markov process where,\nfor each fixed x \u2265 0, the pay-off function is continuous and bounded but as a\nfunction of x the stochastic gain is locally bounded in x.\n15\nTaking note of (2.2.80) in [21], we may now invoke Corollary 2.9 in the same\nreference to deduce the existence of an optimal stopping time \u03c3\u2217 in (25) which\nis of the form\n\u03c3\u2217 = inf{t > 0 : Y\u02dc xt \u2208 D},\nwhere D = {x : I(x) = g(x)}.\nSince \u03b1 = q \u2212 \u03c8(1) < 0 and g(x) \u2265 1 + \u03b4, we have that 0 \u2208 D. Now, define\ns := sup{0 \u2264 x < b\u2217 : I(x) = g(x)}.\nTaking \u03c3 = T\u2212a\u2217 in the expectation on the right hand side of (25) leads to a\nvalue of V (x, a\u2217, b\u2217) and thus for any x > a\u2217 it holds that I(x) \u2264 V (x, a\u2217, b\u2217) <\nex + \u03b4 where the last inequality follows by virtue of (21). As a consequence,\nwe now see that s \u2264 a\u2217.\n(i) We want to rule out the case that s < a\u2217 and then part (i) will follow.\nSuppose for contradiction that s < a\u2217. Then, on [s, b\u2217] we have I = V (\u00b7, s, b\u2217).\nIn particular, it holds that\nI \u2032(s+)=V \u2032(s, s, b\u2217)\n= es + \u03b4\n+ es\n(\n\u2212qW (q)(b\u2212 s) + W\n(q)\u2032(b\u2212 s)\nW (q)(b\u2212 s)\n(\nZ(q)(b\u2212 s)\u2212 1\u2212 \u03b4e\u2212s\n))\n.\nThe fact that 0 < f \u2032(b\u2217 \u2212 a\u2217) implies that W (q)\u2032(b\u2217 \u2212 s)\/W (q)(b\u2217 \u2212 s) < 1 and\nthus, using Lemma 10 we find\nI \u2032(s)>es + \u03b4 + es\n(\n\u2212qW (q)(b\u2217 \u2212 s) + Z(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 s)\u2212 1\u2212 \u03b4e\u2212s\n)\n>es,\nwhere the last inequality is a consequence of the fact that f(b\u2217 \u2212 s) > f(b\u2217 \u2212\na\u2217) = 1. Since I(s) = es + \u03b4, the previous calculations indicate that I violates\nits upper bound ex + \u03b4. We conclude that s = a\u2217 and thus (a\u2217, b\u2217) \u2286 Dc.\n(ii) The next step in the proof is to show that for all x \u2208 [0, b\u2217)\nI(x) > ex. (26)\nWe prove (26) by contradiction. First, we show that there are only a finite\nnumber of intervals (l, r) satisfying (l, r) \u2282 Dc, 0 \u2264 l < r \u2264 a\u2217, I(l) = el + \u03b4,\nI(r) = er + \u03b4 and such that there is some x \u2208 (l, r) for which I(x) \u2264 ex.\nIndeed, since \u03b1 < 0, taking into account the fact that optimal stopping occurs\n16\nwhenever Y\u02dc x hits the domain D and that X is spectrally negative, we deduce\nthat for any x \u2208 (l, r), with (l, r) an interval satisfying the properties above,\nI(x) \u2265 el + \u03b4,\nsince (a\u2217, b\u2217) \u2282 Dc, and since from (22) it follows that\ninf\nx\u2208D\u2229[r,\u221e)\ng(x) = er + \u03b4 > el + \u03b4.\nHence, whenever x \u2208 (l, r) satisfies I(x) < ex, then it must hold that x \u2265\nlog(el + \u03b4). In particular, (l, r) is necessarily of minimal length log(el + \u03b4)\u2212 l\nand therefore there can be only finitely many intervals of this form. Now let\n(l\u2217, r\u2217) be the rightmost of such intervals. Fix x \u2208 (l\u2217, r\u2217) and set\nT(l\u2217,r\u2217) = inf{t > 0 : Y xt \/\u2208 (l\u2217, r\u2217)}.\nNote that T(l\u2217,r\u2217) \u2264 TD, where\nTD = inf{t > 0 : Y xt \u2208 D}.\nSince\n{e\u2212\u03b1(t\u2227TD)I(Y xt\u2227TD)}\nis a P1-martingale (cf. Theorem 2.4 in [21]) we have\nI(x) =E1[e\u2212\u03b1T(l\u2217,r\u2217)I(Y xT(l\u2217,r\u2217))]\n=E1[e\u2212\u03b1T(l\u2217,r\u2217)\n(\n(e\nY x\nT\u2212\nl\u2217 + \u03b4)1{T\u2212\nl\u2217<T\n+\nr\u2217} + I(Y\nx\nT+\nr\u2217\n)1{T+\nr\u2217<T\n\u2212\nl\u2217}\n)\n]\n\u2265E1[e\u2212\u03b1T(l\u2217,r\u2217)\n(\n(e\nY x\nT\u2212\nl\u2217 + \u03b4)1{T\u2212\nl\u2217<T\n+\nr\u2217} + e\nY x\nT+\nr\u22171{T+\nr\u2217<T\n\u2212\nl\u2217}\n)\n]\n= V (x, l\u2217, r\u2217),\nwhere for the inequality we used the fact that we have chosen (l\u2217, r\u2217) as the\nrightmost interval on which I(x) > ex fails. Since r\u2217 \u2264 b\u2217, we have for x \u2208\n(l\u2217, r\u2217)\nV (x, l\u2217, r\u2217)\n= ex\n(\nZ(q)(r\u2217 \u2212 x)\u2212W (q)(r\u2217 \u2212 x) Z\n(q)(r\u2217 \u2212 l\u2217)\nW (q)(r\u2217 \u2212 l\u2217) + (1 + \u03b4e\n\u2212l\u2217)\nW (q)(r\u2217 \u2212 x)\nW (q)(r\u2217 \u2212 l\u2217)\n)\n\u2265 ex\n(\nZ(q)(r\u2217 \u2212 x)\u2212 W\n(q)(r\u2217 \u2212 x)\nW (q)(r\u2217 \u2212 l\u2217)\n(\nZ(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 l\u2217)\u2212 1\u2212 \u03b4e\u2212l\u2217\n))\n\u2265 exZ(q)(r\u2217 \u2212 x)\n> ex,\n17\nwhere we have used Lemma 10. This contradiction has the desired implication\nthat I(x) > ex for all x < a\u2217.\nIn the next result we establish that there exists a saddle point for the Shepp\u2013\nShiryaev stochastic game. Recall that I(x) is specified by (25) where the func-\ntion g is arbitrary up to the specified constraints following equation (25).\nProposition 12 Let 0 < q < \u03c8(1) and \u03b4 > Z(q)(y\u2217)\u2212 1. The stochastic game\n(1) has a solution and its value satisfies V (x) = I(x) for all x \u2265 0.\nProof. The proof uses the Verification Lemma 7 applied to the function\nV \u2217 = I and the stopping times \u03c4 \u2217 = T+b\u2217 and\n\u03c3\u2217 = inf{t > 0 : Y xt \u2208 D \u2229 [0, a\u2217]},\nwhere D = {x \u2265 0 : I(x) = g(x)}.\nFrom Theorem 11 we have that I(x) fulfils conditions (i)\u2013(iv) of Lemma 7.\nBy standard optimal stopping theory and the strong Markov property, the\nsubmartingale property (v) automatically holds, see for example Theorem\n2.4 of [21]. It remains to justify the remaining condition (vi). By consider-\ning E1(\u0398\u03b1\nT+\nb\u2217 ,T\n\u2212\na\u2217\n|Ft) where \u0398\u03b1\u00b7,\u00b7 was defined in (15) and applying the strong\nMarkov property, it is straightforward to show with the help of (20) that\n{e\u2212\u03b1teY xt Z(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 Y xt ) : t < T+b\u2217 \u2227 T\u2212a\u2217} is a P1-martingale. Since I(x) =\nexZ(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 x) for x \u2265 a\u2217 it holds that I belongs to C2(a\u2217, b\u2217) and one may\nto apply Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula for semi-martingales (cf. Theorem 32, p78 of [22]) to\ndeduce that (\u0393\u2212\u03b1)I(x) = 0 on (a\u2217, b\u2217), where \u0393 is the infinitesimal generator\nof \u2212X under P1. Note also that since {e\u2212Xt\u2212\u03c8(1)t : t \u2265 0} is a martingale\nunder P1 we have that (\u0393 \u2212 \u03b1)ex = \u2212qex for all x \u2208 R. It now follows that\n(\u0393 \u2212 \u03b1)I(x) \u2264 0 for x > b\u2217. Appealing to the known behaviour of the scale\nfunction Z(q) at zero (cf. Chapter 8 of [16]), if X has bounded variation then\nI belongs to C2[(a\u2217, b\u2217)\u222a (b\u2217,\u221e)]\u2229C0(a\u2217,\u221e) and otherwise, when X has un-\nbounded variation, I belongs to C2[(a\u2217, b\u2217)\u222a (b\u2217,\u221e)]\u2229C1(a\u2217,\u221e). In the first\ncase, the version of the change of variable formula (which is nothing more than\na special case of Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula for semi-martingales) in [17] may be used, and\nin the second case the version of Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula established in [19] or [7] may\nbe used together with the fact that (\u0393\u2212 \u03b1)I(x) \u2264 0 for x \u2208 (a\u2217, b\u2217) \u222a (b\u2217,\u221e)\nto deduce that {e\u2212\u03b1teY xt Z(q)(b\u2217 \u2212 Y xt ) : t < T\u2212a\u2217} is a supermartingale.\nNote that right-continuity of the paths of all the above-mentioned semi mar-\ntingales is clear on account of the continuity of I and the right-continuity of\nY x.\nWere it not for the fact that we have not yet proved that I(x) = ex + \u03b4 for\nall x \u2264 a\u2217, i.e. that D \u2229 [0, a\u2217] = [0, a\u2217], we would be able to claim that the\nproof of Theorem 3 (i) is now complete. However, we must still rule out the\n18\npossibility that I(x) < ex + \u03b4 for some interval \u2205 6= (l, r) \u2286 [0, a\u2217]. We finish\nthis subsection by excluding this possibility and hence concluding the proof\nof Theorem 3 (i).\nTheorem 13 The value function I(x) \u2212 ex is decreasing and hence part (i)\nof Theorem 3 holds.\nProof. Let x > y \u2265 0. We use the notation \u03c3(x) to make explicit the depen-\ndency of the stopping time \u03c3 \u2208 T0,\u221e on the initial position of the process Y x.\nWe then find that for any x \u2265 0\nV (x)\u2264E[e\u2212q\u03c4\u2217(x)+(x\u2228X\u03c4\u2217(x))1{\u03c4\u2217(x)\u2264\u03c3\u2217(y)}]\n+ E[e\u2212q\u03c3\u2217(y)\n(\nex\u2228X\u03c3\u2217(y) + \u03b4eX\u03c3\u2217(y)\n)\n1{\u03c3\u2217(y)<\u03c4\u2217(x)}]\nand similarly, for any y \u2265 0\nV (y)\u2265E[e\u2212q\u03c4\u2217(x)+(y\u2228X\u03c4\u2217(x))1{\u03c4\u2217(x)\u2264\u03c3\u2217(y)}]\n+ E[e\u2212q\u03c3\u2217(y)\n(\ney\u2228X\u03c3\u2217(y) + \u03b4eX\u03c3\u2217(y)\n)\n1{\u03c3\u2217(y)<\u03c4\u2217(x)}].\nNow, let x > y \u2265 0. Then\nV (x)\u2212 V (y)\u2264E[e\u2212q\u03c4\u2217(x)\n(\nex\u2228X\u03c4\u2217(x) \u2212 ey\u2228X\u03c4\u2217(x)\n)\n1{\u03c4\u2217(x)\u2264\u03c3\u2217(y)}]\n+ E[e\u2212q\u03c3\u2217(y)\n(\nex\u2228X\u03c3\u2217(y) \u2212 ey\u2228X\u03c4\u2217(x)\n)\n1{\u03c3\u2217(y)<\u03c4\u2217(x)}].\nSince for any a it holds that\nex\u2228a \u2212 ey\u2228a \u2264 ex \u2212 ey,\nwe deduce\nV (x)\u2212 V (y) \u2264 ex \u2212 ey. (27)\nSince V (a\u2217) = ea\n\u2217\n+ \u03b4 and since V (x) \u2264 ex + \u03b4 for all x, it follows that\nV (x) = ex + \u03b4 for all x \u2208 [0, a\u2217]. The result follows.\n4.2 The case \u03b4 \u2264 Z(q)(y\u2217)\u2212 1.\nLet us now conclude this section and the proof of Theorem 3 by establishing\nthe following result. Recall that we are still under the regime 0 < q < \u03c8(1).\nTheorem 14 If \u03b4 \u2264 Z(q)(y\u2217)\u22121, then there exists a unique z\u2217 \u2208 (0, y\u2217] which\nsatisfies Z(q)(z\u2217) = 1 + \u03b4. The value function is given by\nV (x) = exZ(q)(z\u2217 \u2212 x)\n19\nand optimal stopping times are \u03c3\u2217 = T\u22120 and \u03c4\n\u2217 = T+z\u2217. In particular, part (ii)\nof Theorem 3 holds.\nProof. Since 1 + \u03b4 \u2264 Z(q)(y\u2217) and Z(q)(0) = 1, it follows that there exists a\nz\u2217 \u2208 (0, y\u2217] such that 1 + \u03b4 = Z(q)(z\u2217).\nNext, note that from Lemma 8\nV (x) = exZ(q)(z\u2217 \u2212 x) = V (x, 0, z\u2217)\nand hence we can complete the proof by showing that the triple (V, T+z\u2217 , T\n\u2212\n0 )\nfulfils the conditions (i) \u2013 (vi) of Lemma 7. It is immediately clear from the\ndefinition of V that condition (i) holds. Next, note that V \u2032(x) = exf(z\u2217 \u2212 x).\nSince by Lemma 9 the function f is strictly positive and since V (0) = \u03b4,\nit follows that V (x) \u2264 \u03b4 + ex and hence condition (ii) of Lemma 7 holds.\nConditions (iii) and (iv) are automatic.\nTo establish conditions (v) and (vi) of Lemma 7 one needs to appeal to\nthe semi-martingale decomposition of e\u2212\u03b1tV (Y xt ). Similar arguments to those\ngiven in the proof of Proposition 12 lead to\ne\u2212\u03b1tV (Y xt )=V (x) +\n\u222b t\n0\n(\u0393\u2212 \u03b1)V (Y xs ) ds+\n\u222b t\n0\nV \u2032(Y xs ) d(x \u2228Xs) +Mt\n=V (x) +\n\u222b t\n0\n(\u0393\u2212 \u03b1)V (Y xs ) ds+ V \u2032(0+)(x \u2228X t) +Mt, (28)\nwhere \u0393 is the generator of \u2212X under P1, (\u0393\u2212\u03b1)V (x) = 0 for x \u2208 (0, z\u2217) and\n(\u0393 \u2212 \u03b1)V (x) \u2264 0 for x > z\u2217 and M is a martingale. Note also that the term\nV \u2032(Y xs ) may be replaced by V\n\u2032(0+) as x\u2228Xs increases only when Y xs = 0. From\nthis, one sees in the above semi-martingale decomposition that the process\n{e\u2212\u03b1tV (Y xt ) : t \u2264 T\u22120 \u2227 T+z\u2217} is a martingale and that {e\u2212\u03b1tV (Y xt ) : t \u2264 T\u22120 } is\na supermartingale. Again, right-continuity of paths is obvious. As the second\nintegral in (28) is equal to V \u2032(0+)(x \u2228X t) (in particular, it is an increasing,\ncontinuous, adapted process), it follows that {e\u2212\u03b1tV (Y xt ) : t \u2264 T+z\u2217} is also a\nright-continuous submartingale. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.\n5 Proof of Theorem 4\nThe proof goes along the lines of the proof of Theorem 14, principally ap-\npealing to the semi-martingale decomposition (28) for the specified triple\n(V, \u03c4 \u2217, \u03c3\u2217). For Theorem 4 (iv) it is possible to compute exactly the quan-\ntities (\u0393 \u2212 \u03b1)V (x) and V \u2032(0+). In the remaining cases one may deduce the\nnecessary properties of (\u0393 \u2212 \u03b1)V (x) as in the proof of Theorem 14 and that\n20\nV \u2032(0+) = f(z\u2217 \u2227 k\u2217) \u2265 0 from the properties of the function f mentioned in\nSection 2.\n6 Proof of Theorem 2\nRecall that for q = 0, the pay-off of the game is given by\nGxt,s = e\nXt\u2228x1{t\u2264s} + (eXs\u2228x + \u03b4eXs)1{s<t} (29)\nLemma 15 Suppose that there exists some \u03c3\u2217 \u2208 T0,\u221e such that\nE[Gx\u221e,\u03c3\u2217 ] = inf\n\u03c3\u2208T0,\u221e\nE[Gx\u221e,\u03c3]. (30)\nThen the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev stochastic game (2) has value function V and a\nsaddle point is given by \u03c4 \u2217 = \u221e and \u03c3\u2217. Otherwise said, it is optimal for the\ninf-player to never stop.\nProof. Let \u03c3 \u2208 T0,\u221e. Then it is straightforward to show that Gx\u00b7,\u03c3 is a mono-\ntone non-decreasing function. We find that for any \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 T0,\u221e\nE[Gx\u03c4,\u03c3\u2217 ] \u2264 E[Gx\u221e,\u03c3\u2217 ] \u2264 E[Gx\u221e,\u03c3],\nwhere the first inequality follows by the aforementioned monotonicity and the\nsecond inequalitiy follows by the optimality of \u03c3\u2217 in (30).\nRemark 16 (Problems with change of measure) It is tempting to solve\n(30) by the change of measure we have used throughout this paper, but the\nfollowing example shows that when q = 0, the corresponding optimal stopping\nproblem under P1 is a different one.\nLet q = 0 and \u03c8(1) < 0 such that \u03c8\u2032(1) \u2265 0. Since Gxs,t \u2265 ex for all s, t we\nimmediately see that\ninf\n\u03c3\u2208T0,\u221e\nE[Gx\u221e,\u03c3] \u2265 ex.\nHowever, the optimal stopping problem under the changed measure is given\nby\ninf\n\u03c3\u2208T0,\u221e\nE[e\u03c8(1)\u03c3(eY x\u03c3 + \u03b4)].\nThe latter optimal stopping problem has value zero, which can be seen by\nconsidering the sequence of stopping times (\u03c3n)n\u2208N defined by\n\u03c3n := inf{t \u2265 n : Y xt = 0}\nwhich is almost surely finite under P1. The reason for this phenomenon is that\nthe equality\nE[ex\u2228X\u03c3 + \u03b4eX\u03c3 ] = E1[eY x\u03c3 + \u03b4]\n21\nholds whenever P1(\u03c3 < \u221e) = P(\u03c3 < \u221e) = 1. Since X drifts to \u2212\u221e under P\nwe have that P(\u03c3n <\u221e) < 1 for any n \u2208 N.\nOn account of the above remark, we consider (30) as an optimal stopping\nproblem for (X,X), just as was done in the first paper on the Russian option\nin [23]. We modify our notation and write for y \u2265 x\nV (x, y) := inf\n\u03c3\u2208T0,\u221e\nE[ex\u2228(y+X\u03c3) + \u03b4ey+X\u03c3 ]. (31)\nAgain by standard theory on optimal stopping we know there exists a (possibly\ninfinite) stopping time \u03c3\u2217 = \u03c3\u2217(x, y) at which the infimum in (31) is attained.\nWe have the following verification lemma for (30), the proof of which is omitted\nas it is similar to the proof of Lemma 7.\nLemma 17 Let \u03c3\u2217 \u2208 T0,\u221e and let\nV \u2217(x, y) = E[ex\u2228(y+X\u03c3\u2217 ) + \u03b4ey+X\u03c3\u2217 ].\nThen (V \u2217(x, 0), \u03c3\u2217) is a solution to (30) if\n(i) V \u2217(x, y) \u2264 ex + \u03b4ey,\n(ii) the process {V \u2217(X t, Xt) : t \u2265 0} is a right-continuous submartingale.\nProof of Theorem 2.\nFirst, suppose \u03c8(1) \u2265 0. Then {Mt}t\u22650 defined by\nMt = e\nx\u2228(y+Xt) + \u03b4ey+Xt\nis a P-submartingale. Indeed, for 0 \u2264 s \u2264 t\nE[Mt|Fs]\u2265 ex\u2228(Xs+y) + \u03b4ey+XsE[eX\u02dct\u2212s ]\n= ex\u2228(Xs+y) + \u03b4ey+Xse\u03c8(1)(t\u2212s)\n\u2265Ms,\nwhere X\u02dc denotes an independent copy of X. Hence, in this case Lemma 17\nshows that V (x) = ex + \u03b4 and \u03c3\u2217 = 0 solve (30), which agrees with part (i) of\nTheorem 2.\nNext, let \u03c8(1) < 0 and \u03b4(\u03a6(0) \u2212 1) > 1 and consider \u03c3\u2217 = \u221e. Since X\u221e is\nexponentially distributed with parameter \u03a6(0), we find for x \u2265 y\n22\nV \u2217(x, y) : =E[ex\u2228(y+X\u221e) + \u03b4ey+X\u221e ]\n=E[ex\u2228(X\u221e+y)]\n= ex\n\u222b x\u2212y\n0\n\u03a6(0)e\u2212\u03a6(0)z dz +\n\u222b \u221e\nx\u2212y\n\u03a6(0)e\u2212\u03a6(0)z+z+y dz\n= ex(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03a6(0)(x\u2212y)) + \u03a6(0)\n\u03a6(0)\u2212 1e\nxe\u2212\u03a6(0)(x\u2212y)\n= ex +\n1\n\u03a6(0)\u2212 1e\n\u2212(\u03a6(0)\u22121)x+\u03a6(0)y\nand in particular, by the condition on \u03b4\nV \u2217(x, y) \u2264 ex + \u03b4ey.\nAs X is a strong Markov process, we have that\nX\u221e = X t \u2228 (Xt +X \u2032\u221e)\nwhere X\n\u2032\n\u221e is a copy of X\u221e which is independent of Ft and thus\nE[ex\u2228(X\u221e+y)|Ft] =E[ex\u2228(Xt+y)\u2228(Xt+y+X\n\u2032\n\u221e)|Ft]\n=V \u2217(x \u2228 (X t + y), Xt + y).\nIt now follows that {V \u2217(X t, Xt)}t\u22650 is a P-martingale (and hence in particular\na submartingale). Again using Lemma 17, we deduce part (ii) of Theorem 2.\nFinally, let \u03c8(1) < 0 and \u03b4(\u03a6(0)\u2212 1) \u2264 1 and take x \u2265 y. If we take\n\u03c3\u2217 = \u03c4+x = inf{t > 0 : Xt \u2265 x} = T\u22120 ,\nwe have\nV \u2217(x, y) : =E[eX\u03c3\u2217 + \u03b4eX\u03c3\u2217 ]\n= ex + \u03b4exP(\u03c4+x\u2212y <\u221e)\n= ex + \u03b4e\u2212(\u03a6(0)\u22121)x+\u03a6(0)y\nand again we have that V \u2217(x, y) \u2264 ex + \u03b4ey. Since {e\u03a6(0)Xt} is a martingale,\nthe submartingale property follows from Ito\u02c6\u2019s formula and the fact that\n\u222b t\n0\n\u2202\n\u2202x\nV \u2217(Xt, Xt) dX t=\n\u222b t\n0\n(eXt + \u03b4(1\u2212 \u03a6(0))e\u2212(\u03a6(0)\u22121)Xt+\u03a6(0)Xt) dX t\n=\n\u222b t\n0\neXt(1 + \u03b4 \u2212 \u03a6(0)\u03b4) dX t \u2265 0,\n23\nwhere the second equality is due to the fact that X t only increases when\nXt = X t and the proof of Theorem 2 is complete.\n7 Concluding remarks\nRemark 18 In the proof of Theorem 13, the spectral negativity of the process\nis not used. This indicates that if a solution to the game exists, then the\n(possibly empty) sets I1, I2 and I3 defined by\nI1 : = {x \u2208 [0,\u221e) : V (x) = ex + \u03b4},\nI2 : = {x \u2208 [0,\u221e) : ex < V (x) < ex + \u03b4},\nI3 : = {x \u2208 [0,\u221e) : V (x) = ex}\nsatisfy\nx1 < x2 < x3 for all xi \u2208 Ii, i = 1, 2, 3\nand thus the solution to the game, if it exists, must be of the same nature\nfor a more general Le\u00b4vy process. An existence result for Nash (saddle point)\nequilibrium and the weaker Stackelberg equilibrium to optimal stopping games\nin a general Markovian setting (including Le\u00b4vy processes) can be found in [9].\nIn that paper, optimal stopping games are considered with a pay-off function\nof the general form\nG1(X\u03c4 )1{\u03c4<\u03c3} +G1(X\u03c3)1{\u03c3<\u03c4} +G3(X\u03c4 )1{\u03c3=\u03c4},\nwhere \u03c4 and \u03c3 are the strategies of the sup-player and inf-player, respectively.\nFor the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev game the right-continuous, quasi-left-continuous strong\nMarkov process is (t,Xt, X t) and the functions G1, G2 and G3 are given by\nG1(t, x, s) = G3(t, x, s) = e\n\u2212qt+s and G2(t, x, s) = e\u2212qt(es + \u03b4ex).\nThe assumptions\nEx sup\nt\u22650\n|Gi(Xt)| <\u221e for x \u2208 R (i = 1, 2, 3) (32)\nin [9] on the pay-off functions (to imply existence of a Nash equilibrium (saddle\npoint) to the corresponding optimal stopping game) are consistent with the\ntraditional assumption\nEx sup\nt\u22650\n|G(Xt)| <\u221e\nfor results concerning existence of solutions optimal stopping problems with\npay-off G. We find that we cannot always fit the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev game in this\nframework because of the same reason the Russian optimal stopping prob-\nlem does not always satisfy the assumptions of traditional optimal stopping\n24\ntheorems. For example, when X is a spectrally negative Le\u00b4vy process with\n\u03c8(1) > q, the conditions (32) are not satisfied since E supt\u22650 |G2(t,Xt, X t)| is\nbounded from below by supt\u22650 \u03b4E[e\u2212qt+Xt ] \u2265 supt\u22650 \u03b4e(\u03c8(1)\u2212q)t = \u221e. On the\nother hand, if we consider the Shepp\u2013Shiryaev game with finite horizon then\nthe assumptions in [9] are automatically satisfied thus guaranteeing a saddle\npoint.\nIt should also be pointed out that there are examples of optimal stopping\ngames which have a value but where the failure of (32) means that there is\nalso failure for the existence of a saddle point. See for example [10].\nRemark 19 When X is a Brownian motion with parameter \u03c3 > 0 and drift\n\u00b5, it can be directly checked by taking Laplace transforms that the scale\nfunctions for X are given by\nW (q)(x) =\n2\n\u03c32\u000f\ne\u03b2x sinh(\u000fx), Z(q)(x) = e\u03b2x cosh(\u000fx)\u2212 \u03b2\n\u000f\ne\u03b3x sinh(\u000fx),\nwhere \u000f = 1\n\u03c3\n\u221a\n\u00b52\/\u03c32 + 2q and \u03b2 = \u2212\u00b5\/\u03c32. In [15] the game is solved whenever\nq > \u03c8(1) \u2265 0. Since, when \u03b4 is large enough, z\u2217 satisfies Z(q)(z\u2217) = 1 + \u03b4 we\nfind that k\u2217 := ez\n\u2217\nsolves\nk\u03b2\u2217 (k\n\u000f\n\u2217 + k\n\u2212\u000f\n\u2217 )\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u000f\nk\u03b2\u2217 (k\n\u000f\n\u2217 \u2212 k\u2212\u000f\u2217 ) = 2(1 + \u03b4),\nwhich agrees with (7) in [15]. In [15] there is an additional technical condi-\ntion (4) on the optimal stopping boundary k\u2217. The aforementioned condition\npertains to the requirement that V \u2032(0+) \u2265 0 (which ultimately is required for\nthe appropriate submartingale property to hold). Working here with general\nspectrally negative Le\u00b4vy processes, and in particular with scale functions, has\nseemingly produced arguments which have circumvented the need for such a\ncondition. Hence, from the results in this paper, it follows that the claim in\n[15] (that this condition is necessary) is in fact false.\nAcknowledgements\nPart of this work was carried out whilst the first author was visiting the De-\npartment of Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics at Heriot-Watt University\nand the Department of Mathematical Sciences at The University of Bath.\nHe is grateful for their hospitality.
