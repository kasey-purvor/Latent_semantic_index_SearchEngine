Industrial health and safety is an important yet largely unexplored \napplication area of ubiquitous computing. In this paper we investigate the \nrelationship between technology and organization in the context of a concrete \nindustrial health and safety system. The system is designed to reduce the \nnumber of incidents of \u201cvibration white finger\u201d (VWF) at construction sites and \nuses wireless sensor nodes for monitoring workers\u2019 exposure to vibrations and \ntesting of compliance with legal health and safety regulations. In particular we \ninvestigate the impact of this ubiquitous technology on the relationship between \nmanagement and operatives, the formulation of health and safety rules and the \nrisk perception and risk behavior of operatives. In addition, we contrast sensor-\nnetwork inspired and smart artifact inspired compliance systems, and make the \ncase that these technology models have a strong influence on the linkage \nbetween technology and organization.  \nKeywords: ubiquitous computing, sensor network, smart artifact, workplace \nsupport, occupational health and safety, safety culture, risk management, \ncompliance architecture, organizational fit, privacy.  \n1 Introduction  \nIndustrial workplaces such as construction sites, factories and plants pose enormous \nrisks for workers and operatives. The International Labor Organization has estimated \nthat some two million people die every year from work-related accidents and diseases \nworldwide [1]. An estimated 160 million people suffer from work-related diseases, \nand there are an estimated 270 million fatal and non-fatal work-related accidents per \nyear. In economic terms, this means that 4% of the world's annual GDP is lost as a \nconsequence of occupational diseases and accidents. Lowering occupational risks has \nlong been the focus of legal authorities and industrial firms. It is an interesting and \nimportant question to ask if and how ubiquitous computing can play a role in making \nindustrial workplaces safer.  \n        \nUbiquitous tracking and monitoring technologies are now routinely used in \nindustrial environments [2,3], but very rarely with the goal to improve occupational \nhealth and safety. Research in ubiquitous computing has shown promise in health-\nrelated domains such as hospitals [4], elder care [5] and emergency rescue [6], yet \napplications in industrial settings are few. Over the last 1 \u0001 year, we have explored \nubiquitous computing technologies for industrial workplaces, with a special focus on \nhealth and safety. In particular, we developed a sensor-based system designed to \nreduce the number of incidents of \u201cvibration white finger\u201d (VWF) at construction \nsites [7]. The system monitors workers\u2019 exposure to vibrations when using heavy-\nduty equipment such as pneumatic drills, tests compliance with legal health and safety \nregulations in real-time and creates detailed data records of worker\u2019s vibration \nexposure.  \nAn industrial organization is a complex socio-technical system that is characterized \nby the formal and informal practices, rules and habits that influence interactions \nbetween people and groups in the organization. Designing technology, such as our \nvibration monitoring system, to fit established work practices and to function properly \nwithin an existing organization is a difficult task. Novel technology may disturb the \nbalance between the various players and result in unintended and unforeseen \nconsequences. To minimize the risk of failure it is essential that we assess a system\u2019s \npotential impact on work practices and identify an appropriate linkage between \ntechnology and organization as early as possible in the design process. This problem \nhas been widely researched in the information systems community [8,9], but is just \nbeginning to receive attention with regard to ubiquitous computing [10].  \nIn the context of the previously mentioned vibration monitoring case study this \npaper makes two specific contributions: First, we identify work-organizational issues \nthat are relevant for ubiquitous health and safety systems. According to Doherty and \nKing [11] organizational issues are issues that need to be treated during the systems \ndevelopment process to ensure that the individual human, wider social, and economic \nimpacts of the resultant technical system are likely to be desirable. In particular we \ninvestigate the representation of health and safety rules, the relationship between \noperatives and management, and operatives\u2019 risk perception and risk behavior. We \nargue that these issues need to be understood to enable successful introduction of \nubiquitous health and safety technology in industrial environments.  \nSecond, we define two fundamental architectural alternatives for a ubiquitous \nhealth and safety system and illuminate the architecture\u2019s influence on organizational \nissues. The first architecture is based on the concept of sensor networks and the \nsecond is built around the notion of smart everyday objects. Both models represent \narchetypes that have a great influence in ubiquitous computing research. We discuss \nhow these models differ with respect to centralization and locality and how they may \nimpact in different ways on safety behavior, accountability and formulation of health \nand safety rules. In essence we argue that system architecture is not neutral, but plays \na crucial part in shaping work-organizational factors and thus influences the overall \nsuccess or failure of a ubiquitous computing system in an organization.  \nThe research reported in this paper is part of the interdisciplinary NEMO project. \nIn previous publications we identified research challenges of ubiquitous health and \nsafety system [12], reported our experiences in building and field-testing technology \nprototypes [7], explored safety culture and risk management at participating industrial \n       \nfirms [13,14], and studied human reasoning about health and safety rules [15]. In \ncontrast, this paper focuses on the interplay of technology and organization.  \nIn the remainder of the paper we start our discussion with a description of the \n\u201cvibration white finger\u201d case study (Section 2). This is followed by a discussion of \nmethodological considerations when developing technologies to fit organizations \n(Section 3). Next we explore the sensor network and smart artifact models as two \nopposing alternatives for designing a ubiquitous health and safety system (Section 4). \nThis lays the basis for an in-depths discussion of organizational issues and especially \nthe linkage between system architecture and organization (Section 5).  \n2 Case Study: Controlling Hand-Arm Vibrations \nMost industrial organizations do their utmost to reduce the risks associated with work \nactivities and to provide a safe and healthy work environment. The reasons for this \ncan be attributed to economic, legal and social pressures. As a matter of fact, health \nand safety compliance has today become a strategic objective for many large \ncompanies [16]. To prove compliance, organizations need to provide evidence that \nappropriate controls are in place \u2013 and that they work. While this can be done in \nseveral ways, it commonly involves data collection and record keeping, a process that \nis time consuming and costly. As a result of the mounting legislative pressure and the \nincreasing need to prove compliance, companies have started to look for innovative \nways to ensure workplace safety and are increasingly using enterprise-wide health and \nsafety management systems. We believe that ubiquitous computing technology and \nembedded wireless systems offer a great potential for improving health and safety \nprocesses. Similarly, industrial safety exposes important new research challenges for \nubiquitous computing [12].  \nAs part of the NEMO project we have teamed up with major industrial firms to \nidentify health and safety scenarios and to study technology in-situ through field trials \nand workplace studies. One of the first scenarios to come out of this project relates to \nthe potential damage caused by vibrations when operating hand machinery such as \nhydraulic drills and breakers. Long-term exposure to hand arm vibration (HAV) can \nlead to serious health conditions known as \"vibration white finger\" (VWF) and in \nextreme cases to life-long disability. VWF is triggered by prolonged use of vibrating \nmachinery, and causes the fingers to become numb and to begin turning white. In a \nprogressive stadium the disease is irreversible; the person suffers increasingly \nfrequent painful attacks at any time and may even lose their fingers. In order to \nunderstand how companies deal with this problem we investigated legal requirements \nand observed work practices at a major road construction and service company \n(referred to in this paper as Safe-company). The following provides a summary of our \nkey observations.   \n2.1 Vibration-Related Health and Safety Regulations \nExtensive health and safety regulations exist to limit workers' exposure to HAV. For \nexample, in 2005 the UK Parliament introduced the Control of Vibration at Work \nRegulations [17]. The guidelines place a responsibility on employers to assess every \n        \nemployee\u2019s risk and to consider the specific individual working conditions of each \nemployee. The damage caused by exposure to vibration is a combination of both the \nfrequency of the vibrating tool and the duration of the exposure [18]. Using a tool that \nvibrates slightly for a long time can be as damaging as using a heavily vibrating tool \nfor a short time. Thus regulations introduce action and limit values for hand-arm \nvibration [19]: \n\u2022 Exposure action value of 2.5m\/s2 A(8) at which level employers should introduce \ntechnical and organizational measures to reduce exposure. \n\u2022 Exposure limit value of 5.0m\/s2 A(8) which should not be exceeded in all \ncircumstances. \nThese values are defined in terms of the average daily exposure dose A(8) which is \nspecific to each equipment and provided by manufacturers. In practice an operative\u2019s \nvibration exposure can be estimated from three parameters: the equipment type, the \nduration of use and the surface hardness (soft, medium, hard). \n2.2 Safety-related Work Practices \n2.2.1 Methodology \nIn order to understand how organizations address vibration-induced health concerns \nwe conducted an ethnographic study of work practices at Safe-company (see also \n[13,14]). The organization itself saw its emphasis on safety as a unique selling point \nin tendering for new business, and its ability to publicize its involvement with a major \nresearch project in this area as contributing to its safety conscious image. The \nfieldwork for the study consisted of a number of semi-structured interviews with \noperatives and supervisory and management staff, aimed at drawing out \u2018sensitizing \nconcepts\u2019 to inform the later stages of the fieldwork, followed by the extended \nobservation of operatives, together with the collection of documents and other \nartifacts, with the aim of developing a rich understanding of the setting, including \nworking practices, safety and audit culture perceptions, and concerns in relation to \ntechnology. A coding template [20] was then developed to structure the analysis of \ninterview\/fieldwork data, including the theorizing of links between various levels of \ncoding, and the location of the template in the existing literature. The findings from \nthis process were used to inform the technology design and implementation process \non an ongoing basis.  In total, the study involved more than 40 people from Safe-\ncompany (including high-level management, supervisors and operatives), spanning \nover 18 months and 6 different work sites. \nAs part of the interview phase, the interviewees were asked to grant access to \nothers within the specific contracts on which they worked, in order to construct the \nsubsequent program of fieldwork. The fieldwork observations included participation \nin safety training, observation of a wide range of on-site activities, attendance at \nsafety-related meetings (for example, at a number of multi-level, multi-disciplinary \nSafety Action Group meetings), and informal discussions with site operatives. The \nlatter took place both in one-to-one situations (for example, whilst observing them at \ntheir work or driving with them in their vehicles) and in small groups, usually when \noperatives were eating their lunch in the site mess rooms. A range of organizational \nand sector-related documents were also obtained.  \n       \n2.2.2 Work Practices \nOur investigations at Safe-company focused on smallish maintenance work, rather \nthan new construction. Such work is usually carried out by two-men crews that drive \nto the location of defects to carry out repair work prescribed in work orders. The work \nrequires the use of heavy-duty pneumatic drills for breaking open tarmac, saws for \ncutting square holes in the tarmac surrounding potholes, and wacker plates for \ncompacting new tarmac. Such equipment can only be operated by one worker at a \ntime, but workers frequently switch, passing the tool between them. With regard to \npneumatic drills our observations revealed that drilling tends to happen in bouts of 1-5 \nminutes at a time, with 2-3 bouts per patch, but on occasion may take up to about half \nan hour. Operatives often interrupt work for brief moments to turn or place the drill. A \ncrew may do 5-20 patches per day depending on the size of the patches and the \ndistance they have to travel between them. For example, one crew did six patches of \nbetween 30 cm2 and one square meter, with quite a lot of driving around in between, \nwhile another one had a row of nine small patches to do within 100 yards of each \nother, each one about 30 cm2.  \n2.2.3 Current Compliance Practice \nWorkers are advised about safety procedures and the dangers of VWF in so-called \ntoolbox talks. These are a weekly events that cover a variety of topics, most of them \nsafety related. They often only last 10-15 minutes, are conducted in lunch breaks or \nout on site, and are repeated 2-3 times in the course of the day until everyone has \nattended a session. To minimize health damage, the company requires workers to \nwear ear protectors, safety glasses and gloves. Vibration exposure data is manually \nrecorded by operatives on paper sheets, where exposure times and the type of tool \nused are noted (surface conditions are usually ignored and assumed to be \u2018hard\u2019). \nWorkers hand these sheets to their supervisors at the end of the day or week and the \ndata in processed in the backend, often in a central database at the company \nheadquarters. Supervisors will often (but not always) advise workers on the \ncumulative amount of exposure.  \nThe system relies on workers diligently recording their exposure times and handing \nback records to supervisors on time. In practice we observed that this could be \ndifficult since throughout a day a worker may use various vibrating tools at several \nwork sites. Exposures were hand timed by operatives and entered on a paper record \nsheet. This record was often made retrospectively (for example, all exposures for the \nmorning working hours were \u2018calculated\u2019 and entered on the sheet whilst sitting in the \ntruck having lunch) and the process of hand timing was little more than guesswork. \nThus the current practice raises serious concerns with respect to completeness, \naccuracy and consistency of captured data. \n2.2.4 Risk Perception \nThe dangers posed by vibrations can be classified as \u2018invisible risks\u2019, i.e. risks with a \nloose or delayed linkage between the risk and its outcomes. Invisible risks, even if \nappropriately assessed and documented at an organizational level, are often \nunderestimated or viewed as insignificant by operatives. Asking operatives about the \nrisks of hand arm vibration (HAV) was regularly met with a variation of \u2018well, I\u2019ve \n        \nbeen doing this job for twenty years and I haven\u2019t had any problems with it\u2019. Whilst \neveryone seemed to know someone who had suffered from vibration white finger, this \nwas insufficient to make the risk appear \u2018real\u2019 in relation to their own conduct. Most \naccidents in the industry happen through trips, slips and falls, and the most prominent \ndanger to the workers\u2019 lives is posed by road accidents involving cars driving by the \nwork sites. In comparison to this, operatives seem to neglect or disregard a long-term \nrisk such as vibration white finger as a less immediate danger. Managers and \nsupervisors, in contrast, tended to be well aware of invisible risks and of the problems \nassociated with conveying this risk to operatives.  \nWe observed that the lack of recognition of vibration as a serious risk was \nexacerbated by the imprecise and low-key method of collecting exposure data. \nOperatives viewed the system as impractical in relation to actually getting the work \ndone \u2013 i.e. timing and adding up a series of short bursts would be very disruptive to \nthe work itself \u2013 and its low-key nature suggested to them that it was not important \nenough to attempt to do more accurately.  \n2.5 Real-time Compliance Monitoring as an Opportunity for Ubiquitous \nComputing \nA wide variety of IT solutions for managing health and safety compliance exist, yet \nwith respect to hand-arm vibrations our investigations have identified a distinctive \nlack of tailored solutions. The current practice can be improved using mobile data \nentry solutions based on handheld wireless computers. Yet, while mobile solutions \nreduce the need for paper forms, they still suffer from the fact that they rely on human \ninformation gathering and recording in the field.  \nWhereas audits are often seen as one-off events, compliance-related legislation and \nregulation increasingly contains requirements for ongoing and real-time monitoring of \nthe level of compliance. This opens an opportunity for sensor-based ubiquitous \nsystems to improve health and safety compliance. Technologies such as wireless \nsensor network and wearable sensors can be designed to extract salient information \nfrom the workplace, recognize work activities and interpret them (possibly in real-\ntime) with regard to health and safety regulations. In particular we see three beneficial \nuses of ubiquitous technologies: 1) Improving the quality of recorded health and \nsafety data. 2) Providing timely, personalized notices to workers and operatives about \nhealth and safety risks. 3) Improving the understanding of company-wide health and \nsafety risks.  \n3 Designing Technologies to Fit Organizations: Methodological \nConsiderations \nTo minimize project risks, organizational issues should be considered from the very \nbeginning of the development process, starting with idea generation and market \nassessment. In reality, however, this is rarely the case. A study exploring to what \nextent organizational issues are proactively managed in design processes of \nubiquitous computing technologies found that (a) wider organizational aspects are \nperceived to be less of less importance than user centered issues and those directly \n       \nrelated to the effective functioning of the technologies, and that (b) even those \norganizational issues that are considered to be of importance do not actually influence \nthe design process [10].  \nDesigning technologies for industrial organizations requires an understanding of \nthe roles, needs and expectations of a variety of stakeholders. In our case study we are \nconcerned with legal authorities, insurance companies, management, supervisors and \noperatives. Not every stakeholder has the same influence on the design process and \nthe resulting system might benefit one stakeholder (for example management) to the \ndetriment of another (for example operatives). Such a situation can lead to conflicts \nthat negatively impact the functioning of the overall organization and, in our case, \ncould mean a worsening of the company\u2019s health and safety record.  \nThere is a particular danger that development is driven by technology visions, \nrather than by a grounded understanding of the organization and its business \nenvironment. On the other hand, in order to innovate we cannot always wait until we \nhave a full understanding of these issues. Many questions will only come to light once \nwe had a chance to try things out in the real world. Thus, we are faced with a \nmethodological problem: how can we design technology if we do not fully understand \nthe organizational environment, and how can we assess a technology that has not yet \nfully materialized and that has not yet been deployed within the organization? This is \na problem that is common to technology innovation but especially profound for \nubiquitous computing technologies that have the potential to fundamentally alter \nestablished principles and practices. A similar problem is described in [21]. To solve \nthis methodological problem we use an approach combining five elements:  \n\u2022 Development of technology-driven demonstrators \n\u2022 Field trials of technology prototypes \n\u2022 Observational work place studies \n\u2022 Lab-based human studies \n\u2022 Comparative studies of prior technology deployments  \nThe observational studies are described above. We use lab-based studies to explore \nquestions of human perception, understanding and interaction with technology (see \n[15] for some results). Studies of prior technology deployments are concerned with \nsimilar technologies deployed within other companies and different technologies \ndeployed within the same organization. For example, we investigated Safe-company\u2019s \nuse of GPS technology for tracking vehicles. This technology was introduced by the \nmanagement a few years prior to our investigations and was often used as a reference \npoint by operatives and management.  \n4 Architectural Models for Ubiquitous Health and Safety Systems \nIn this section we identify two fundamental alternative system models for a \nubiquitous compliance system. The first is based on the concept of sensor networks \nand the second is built around the notion of smart everyday objects. Both models \nrepresent archetypes that are intuitively understood by ubiquitous computing \nresearchers, even though their technical realization may be less well defined. Their \nimportance lies in the fact that they lead to highly diverging compliance regimes.  \nThese models inspired the construction of a prototype vibration monitoring system \n        \nthat was tested during a 2-week long field trial at Safe-company ([7], see also Section \n4.3). Section 5 then explores the divergent impact of these system models on \norganizational issues.  \n4.1 The Sensor Network Approach \nThe concept of wireless sensor-networks (and smart dust) originally arose in the \ncontext of military applications and since then has been extended to civilian \napplications. Wireless sensor networks are beginning to be used in the industrial \nsector for manufacturing control [2], equipment monitoring and control [3], and \nstructural health monitoring [22]. Wireless sensor networks are composed of low-\npower embedded sensor nodes that are connected through self-forming, self-healing \nwireless networks with flexible topologies. Nodes are distributed throughout the \ntarget environment, sometimes at random, sometimes attached to or embedded in \nobjects. Traditionally, sensor networks have a small number of gateway nodes for \nstreaming sensor data off the network or for interrogating the network state.  \nA ubiquitous compliance system based on the sensor network model can be build \nby scattering wireless nodes throughout the work site or by attaching nodes to work-\nrelated objects and people. To measure vibration we need nodes with vibration \nsensors or accelerometers, attached to vibrating equipment and\/or people. While \nplacing sensor nodes on people would allow direct measurement of vibrations \nexperienced by operatives, such a set-up might run into usability and acceptance \nproblems. Attaching sensors only to machinery would still make it possible to \nestimate human vibration exposure, similar to the way exposure is currently estimated \nusing knowledge about surface conditions and equipment characteristics.  \n \n \n \nFig. 1. Sensor-network inspired compliance system \n       \nA gateway node would connect the sensor network to a back-end enterprise system, \nwhich can be located in the company\u2019s central IT facilities. This enterprise system \nwould permanently store sensor data and provide means for analyzing and \nsummarizing data.  \nA compliance system based on a sensor network model creates a top-down \ncompliance regiment as visualized in Figure 1. Data about operatives\u2019 behavior is \ncaptured in the field using sensors. Sensor data is streamed into a wired compliance \ninfrastructure where it is stored in the form of data logs in a database. Data logs are \nthen analyzed and compared against digitized health and safety regulations. If \ncompliance violations are detected they are reported in the form of exception reports, \nwhich are forwarded to management on a regular weekly or monthly basis. The \ninformation contained in the exception reports provides indications in which way \noperatives violate health and safety regulations. This information is fed back to \noperatives, for example in the form of tailored training measures or through \nenforcement measures such as penalties. In that way, a sensor-network inspired \ncompliance system is similar in character to the paper-based system that is currently \nin place. It improves the quality of the data that is available to the management \n(completeness and accuracy), while at the same time reducing the need for operatives \nand supervisors to manually keep track of work activities. It could be said that a \nsensor-network based compliance system improves the overall efficiency of the \ncompliance monitoring process, but does not fundamentally change its character. This \nis in contrast to the smart artifact approach, which we describe next.  \n4.2 The Smart Artifact Approach \nOne of the key themes of ubiquitous computing is the vision of smart everyday \nobjects, sometimes also called smart artifacts [23,24,25] or physical-digital object \nsystems [26]. Such smart artifacts are objects of our everyday lives, augmented with \ninformation technology and equipped with sensing, computation, and communication \ncapabilities, that are able to perceive and interact with their environment and with \nother smart objects. Smart artifacts retain their original use and appearance while \ncomputing supports a new quality of interaction and behavior. The vision of smart \nartifacts entails the notion of autonomy and self-directed actions based on previously \ncollected information and knowledge about users. For example, a smart tool might \nadapt to its user\u2019s usage pattern and stop operating in harmful situations. In contrast, \nsome researchers stress a people-orientated approach by postulating that smart \nartifacts should make people \u2018smarter\u2019 and empower them to make decisions and take \nactions as mature and responsible people [27]. According to this interpretation, the \noverall design rationale should aim to keep the user engaged and in control whenever \npossible [28].  \nThe technological foundation for smart artifacts and sensor networks is very \nsimilar. In fact, researchers often build smart artifacts by placing sensor network \nnodes inside everyday objects, or by attaching nodes to the object. The difference \nbetween the sensor network approach and the smart artifact approach cannot be found \nin the technology but in the relation between technology and human. A sensor \nnetworks is an instrument for collecting data from the real world; it is not designed to \nbe interacted with and is thus virtually invisible to humans. Smart artifacts, on the \n        \nother hand, retain their physical nature and are conceptualized by humans in terms of \nthe familiar everyday object they are based on.  \nUsing smart artifacts, a compliance system can be realized in a completely different \nfashion (Figure 2). In the centre of the artifact-based compliance system is the smart \nartifact with a capability to observe the operative\u2019s behavior, to create a personalized \nhealth and safety record and to provide context-sensitive notices to the operator. \nNotices may be shown on a small embedded display and relate to the operator\u2019s state \nwith regard to health and safety regulations, for example, if the operator exceeds the \nallowed daily exposure limits. In order to work, the smart artifact must have \nembedded knowledge about relevant health and safety regulations and the capability \nto interpret behavior with respect to these regulations (a partial technical solution was \ndescribed in [29]). An artifact-inspired compliance system creates a feedback loop \nthat enables the operator to watch and - if necessary - to adjust his behavior. This \nempowers the operative and puts him in control of his own health. It can be \nspeculated that having real-time information about their health and safety status and \nbeing able to observe the impact of their actions promotes responsible behavior in \nindividuals and encourages compliance with health and safety regulations. On the \nother hand, an artifact-based compliance system does not provide direct means for \nmanagement to test compliance and to prove it to auditors, because compliance data is \ncreated and managed locally.   \nThe two models described above represent opposing poles of a continuous design \nspectrum. Of course they can be combined and systems can be built that exhibit \nfeatures of both.  \n \n \nFig. 2. Smart artifact inspired compliance system \n4.3 The Prototype System \nIt is clear that neither the sensor-network approach nor the artifact approach alone is \nable to satisfy the needs of all stakeholders. The sensor-network approach captures \ndata with the intention to satisfy audit requirements, but imposes a rigid top-down \napproach on the organization and overly emphasizes enforcement. The smart artifact \napproach supports a bottom-up approach to safety and emphasizes operators\u2019 \nresponsibility, yet it does not address the management's need for centralized record \nkeeping.  \n       \n \nFig. 3. Sensor-based vibration monitor system with  \nwireless drill & dosimeter (reproduced from [7]). \nWe have developed a sensor-based vibration monitoring system that falls \nsomewhat between the sensor-network and the artifact model. It consists of a heavy-\nduty pneumatic drill augmented with a wireless sensor node, and a wireless dosimeter \nthat is worn by operators on top of their protective clothing (Figure 3). The drill \nmeasures vibrations using accelerometers, and the dosimeter records how often and \nhow long an operative uses a drill. The dosimeter shows the user\u2019s current vibration \nexposure on a small display. Vibration exposure is estimated in cooperation between \ndrill and dosimeter using information about the drill type and the duration of use. \nDosimeters are personal devices: each operator uses his or her own device, yet the \ndrill is shared among workers.  \nAt the end of a workday, exposure data is uploaded to a backend database using a \nwireless communication gateway installed in vehicles. The database can be used by \nmanagement to create compliance reports for each individual operative or for the \nwhole workforce. We have tested the entire system in a 2-week long field trial at one \nof Safe-company\u2019s work sites and were able to estimate vibration exposure with an \nerror of less than 8%. Details about the implementation, experiences with the \ntechnical system and a report about the field trial can be found in [7].   \n5  The Interplay between Technology and Organization  \nA ubiquitous compliance system automates large parts of the compliance process. \nActions and responsibilities that previously were in the hands of people are now taken \non by technology. Such a system produces information about people, work activities \nand regulatory compliance at a level of detail that previously has not been available to \nthe organization. It can be expected that the system and the information it produces \nwill be appropriated by the various players to reshape how the organization works. \nMuch of this reshaping will be unexpected and unintentional but we can assume that \nthe effects will be profound.  \nA full assessment of these effects is not possible until after technology has been \ndeployed on a large scale over a longer period of time. However, based on our \nobservations and theoretical insights we are able to identify key organizational issues \nthat will be affected by the introduction of ubiquitous compliance technology. These \n        \nissues are captured by the \u2018compliance triangle\u2019 in Figure 4, which highlights three \nareas: (1) power and control, (2) rule formulation and (3) risk perception and risk \nbehavior. In the following, we will explore these issues in more detail. Furthermore \nwe will argue that the underlying system architecture of a compliance system will \nhave a profound effect on how a system fits in the organizational context and how it \nwill be appropriated.  \n \n \nFig. 4. Compliance triangle \nIn general, the relationship between rules and responsibility emerged as a key \ntheme in our work. This relationship represents a double-edged sword for both \nmanagement and operatives: For the latter, rule following without heedfulness may be \nirresponsible and potentially dangerous. At the same time, not complying with a rule \n\u2013 even when there appears to be a good reason for doing so \u2013 is potentially a \ndisciplinary offence. For the former, rule writing which is abstracted from the realities \nof the rule application setting runs the risk of creating \u2018forced violations\u2019 \u2013 i.e. where \noperatives believe they have no choice but to break a rule in order to address specific \nlocal working conditions, or just to get the job done - and thus being wholly or \npartially ineffective in mitigating the underlying risks.  \n5.1 Formulating and Representing Rules \nAn organization must create an internal control system in order to comply with \nexternal health and safety regulations. The internal control system is a combination of \nexplicit rules (\u201cYou must wear vibration gloves\u201d), informal guidelines, work routines \nand business processes, with explicit rules representing only a small part of the \noverall control system. Yet a ubiquitous compliance system requires a digital \nrepresentation of health and safety rules that is precise and unambiguous. In the case \nof vibration-related regulation the translation of external regulations into internal rules \nis straightforward because legislation is already formulated in very precise language, \nyet in other health and safety areas this is not necessarily the case. While this may \nlimit the scope of a ubiquitous compliance system it also increases the burden for the \norganization to formulate effective and precise internal rules. On the other hand, it can \n       \nbe expected that technology progress will have an influence on how legal regulations \nare formulated in the first place.  \nA more immediate concern for operatives is the abstraction of rule writing from \nrule application. In our interviews we discovered strong reactions from operatives \ntowards rules that had been formulated by management seemingly without \ncomprehension of the consequences for operatives on the ground, including the \npredictable resentment at management enforcing rules that they themselves do not \nhave to operate under (such as wearing full protective equipment on hot days whilst \nworking with tarmac). There is also considerable frustration at \u2018blanket\u2019 rules that fail \nto recognize the variations in specific working conditions. We assume that the \ncontrast between rule writing and rule application will be exacerbated by ubiquitous \ncompliance technology as it increases the need for more precise and less flexible \nrules. \n5.2 Power and Control \nAn issue that is often brought up in the context of ubiquitous computing and its \nimpact on social interactions relates to privacy and surveillance. As Mark Weiser \nalready pointed out, this issue is really about control [30]. In addition to health and \nsafety purposes, information produced by a ubiquitous compliance system can be \nused by management to increase control over operatives, for example by creating \nmore accurate logs of workers\u2019 activities. Even if the system is not used in that way \nby the management, operatives may perceive it in that sense. Similarly, a ubiquitous \ncompliance system may be used in the future for purposes other than health and \nsafety. From that point of view concerns about surveillance and control are \nunderstandable.  \nWe found evidence for perception of control in how operatives view the GPS \nsystem deployed by Safe-company for tracking vehicles. The GPS system had \noriginally been introduced to bring down insurance costs as vehicles had been stolen \nand is now occasionally used to locate people to send them to the nearest work site. \nAt first, GPS units were installed inside vehicles, visible to drivers and operatives. \nYet after some incidents where GPS units were damaged (possibly on purpose), units \nare now installed under the vehicles, with no indication when the unit is activated and \nable to track the vehicle. Operatives do not know much about this system apart from \nthe fact that it is 'there'; they often do not even know whether this system works when \nthe ignition is off. One operatives\u2019 perception of this technology is made clear by this \nstatement:  \u201cIt\u2019s a double edged sword, its good and its bad. We had a case last year, \n[\u2026] one of our drivers knocked a lad down, and because the GPS was running, it \nrecorded everything. And he was found \u2026 he was under the speed limit so \u2026 he was \nin the clear [\u2026 ].  But we also had a case recently where two lads were pulled up for \ndangerous driving and speeding, yeah? [\u2026] the dangerous driving bit was dropped, \nerm, but he went into an argument about the speeding, because the GPS recorded, \n[\u2026] but it doesn\u2019t tell you where he was speeding (in relation to specific speed \nlimits). So we had a situation where we were arguing here \u2013 backwards and forwards, \nbackwards and forwards [\u2026] but they (management) ended up saying [\u2026] \u2018well, we \nknow its speeding, but we can\u2019t say where\u2019, which to me, doesn\u2019t mean a thing.\u201d \n        \nThis example highlights both a perceived lack of trust and a lack of effective, two-\nway communication between management and operatives within Safe-company. \nWhilst there appears to be willingness on both sides, it is insufficient to ensure that \nmanagement reasoning concerning the formulation and purpose of rules, and \noperatives\u2019 experience and expertise in the specifics of the setting, are effectively \ncommunicated to \u2018the other side\u2019. The resultant lack of trust operates both in terms of \nmanagement seeking to control the activities of operatives rather than trusting their \ncommon sense, and operatives ascribing less than altruistic motives to management in \ntheir imposition of rules, with self-preservation in a litigious environment or the \ndesire to maximize profits seen as the \u2018real\u2019 motives behind them.  \nIt is thus obvious that a ubiquitous health and safety system that follows the sensor-\nnetwork model with its implied top-down approach may exacerbate this situation and \nmay lead to a pronounced conflict between management and operatives. If workers \nfeel their privacy is violated, they can feel humiliated and depressed, and it is an open \nquestion how much an organization will benefit or lose from close surveillance of its \nemployees. On the other hand, a ubiquitous health and safety system that follows the \nsmart artifact approach and focuses on increasing operative\u2019s awareness does not \ndirectly intervene in the management\u2013operative relationship. Indirectly such an \napproach may lead to a better understanding of health and safety issues on the \noperatives\u2019 part and facilitate communication. The generally positive attitude \noperatives shown towards the wearable dosimeters can be explained by the fact that in \ncontrast to the GPS system the dosimeter design emphasizes awareness and personal \ncontrol, rather than surveillance. In the word of one project manager: \u201cI don\u2019t think \npeople would object if you were clamping something onto them because they\u2019ve got \nthis view of safety [\u2026] as long as you\u2019re clear that its not about measuring \nproductivity. (So if for example the display that was on the machine - they could see \nwhat was being measured, they would feel comfortable with that, would they?) Yes, I \nthink so. Yes, there\u2019s not a problem, it\u2019s a bit like all sorts of devices like that that \noften on sites and fork lift trucks and all that sort of stuff, but they wouldn\u2019t object.  \nBut the only thing they\u2019d object is if its being used as I say linked to some sort of pay.  \nAnything else they\u2019d be fine.\u201d \nPerception of technology is not only shaped by reality (what a technology is \nactually used for in an organization), but also by the narratives, stories and metaphors \nused to talk about it [31] In this context, it is interesting to note that operatives \nfavorable compared the wearable dosimeters to mobile phones, again emphasizing the \npersonal nature of the device and their control over it, rather than to GPS units (to \nwhich they bear a closer technical resemblance).  \n5.3 Risk Perception and Risk Behavior \nAs outlined at the beginning of the paper, there is a distinct lack of risk awareness \namong operatives, especially in connection with invisible risks. Mitigating invisible \nrisks may require the suspension of ones own judgment in favor of compliance with \nprescribed organizational rules, such as wearing the required personal protective \nequipment. In this instance, a sense of self-efficacy \u2013 of feeling that one can work \nsafely without following the rules or that the possible effects of this type of risk \nsimply \u2018won\u2019t happen to me\u2019 \u2013 needs to be overridden by trust in the efficacy and \n       \napplicability of organizationally devised rules and practices [32,33]. A ubiquitous \nhealth and safety system that exhibits features of the artifact-based approach may be \nable to support this process by raising the awareness of risks and aiding the \nunderstanding of organizational rules. This, however, is only possible when \ninformation is made available in situ, i.e. to operatives in the field while they are \nworking.  \nGoing one step further, a ubiquitous health and safety system could be designed to \nprotect workers by automatically shutting down the drill whenever an operative \nreaches his or her exposure limit. While we did not test this feature in the field trial, \nwe found support for both design options (warning-only and shutting down) among \noperatives and management. The argument for shutting down a tool is that it is the \nbest way to enforce compliance with existing regulations. The arguments against is \nare that it will disturb work too much (for example if a job could be finished with \nanother 30 seconds of drilling, but the tool will not allow it), that people will always \nfind ways to work around technology (for example by swapping dosimeter tags) and \nthat it takes control away from operatives instead of empowering them.  \nThe latter point relates to the ongoing discussion about behavior-based safety \n[34,35]. The theory of behavior-based safety argues against the enforcement style \napproach to safety and emphasizes that employees need to take an ownership of their \nown safety as well as unsafe behaviors. Its purpose is to identify safe and at-risk \nbehaviors, communicate the risk and help to identify safer solutions. The behavior-\nbased approach is fundamentally a data-driven decision-making process that relies on \noperatives as the basic source of expertise of behavioral change. Behavior-based \napproaches are controversial as they shift responsibility for health and safety to the \nworkers without at the same time requiring significant change in the work processes. \nNevertheless, an artifact centric compliance system could be able to empower \noperatives to observe and interpret their own behavior with respect to existing \nregulations, and to motivate them to modify their behavior if necessary.  \nWhile the extent to which an artifact-based system is able to support behavior-\nbased safety is mostly speculation at this point, we did observe initial signs of \ncollaborative safety behavior. At more than one occasion, operatives would show \ntheir dosimeter tags to each other to discuss the meaning of the data and the level of \ntheir exposure. This can be interpreted as collaborative learning process that may lead \nto improved safety behavior. \n5.4 Dealing with Well-Intentioned Violations  \nThe underlying assumption of a ubiquitous compliance system is that any violation of \nhealth and safety rules is bad. While this is true in theory, we discovered that it is not \ntrue in practice. The term \u2018rule violation\u2019 may conjure up visions of deliberate \nsabotage, malicious damage or willful disobedience: in the vast majority of cases, \nhowever, the reality is far more mundane. A so-called \u2018violation\u2019 may be a habitual \nshort-cut to a familiar procedure, a lax interpretation of a rule on the basis of \nperceived self-efficacy or experience, or a genuine attempt to get the job done in \nadverse circumstances (for example, in the absence of the proper equipment). Such \nviolations are concerned with mismatches between rules and reality, and may be as \nsimple as a worker not wearing anti-vibration gloves because he finds them \n        \nuncomfortable. It is also clear from our data that routine rule violations are often \ncondoned \u2013 implicitly or explicitly \u2013 by management, sometimes with a resultant \nperception by operatives of double standards and\/or mercenary motives. In some \ncases, management \u2018turning a blind eye\u2019 may be viewed quite benignly, even when \nadverse consequences ensue. So, for example, one working foreman, who developed \nwhite finger syndrome through over-exposure to hand arm vibration whilst bringing a \ntree-clearing contract back on target, talked about the fact that management praised \nhim for bringing the contract back on track even though they knew he was the only \nperson with a chain saw ticket on the contract, and that he must have been going over \nthe exposure limit. He did not blame them for this behavior, and, in fact, praised them \nfor their responsiveness to the situation once he brought it to their attention. For \nothers, their perception of such condoning is clearly part of a much more generalized, \ncynical perception of management as wanting to maximize profits or minimize the \nlikelihood of being sued by workers in the event of accidents.  \nA ubiquitous compliance system that automatically records rule violations runs \ncounter to such established practices, especially in the case of a sensor-network \ninspired system. If we accept that rule violations can be good - or at least that not all \nrule violations are bad - then a ubiquitous compliance system creates a potential \nproblem for the organization in that it may make it impossible to circumvent the rules \neven if this is in the common interest of management and operatives An artifact-based \nsystem with its focus on local rather than global awareness does not pose the same \nproblem, as it does not make information globally available.  \n6  Conclusion \nIndustrial health and safety is an important but as of yet largely unexplored \napplication area for ubiquitous computing technologies. Our ubiquitous compliance \nsystem for controlling \u201cvibration-white-finger\u201d is one of the first examples of a \nubiquitous health and safety system for industrial workplaces. The underlying \narchitectural model of such a system has a strong influence on the linkage between \ntechnology and organization. A sensor-network model inspired system best supports a \ntop-down compliance regiment that may exacerbate the already strained relationship \nbetween management and operatives because it promotes information imbalance, \ndiscourages workers\u2019 active participation in promoting and ensuring health and safety. \nA smart artifact inspired system, however, with a focus on raising operatives\u2019 \nawareness and control lends itself to a behavior-based safety approach in which health \nand safety policies emerge from the bottom up in the interplay between management \nand operatives. Other significant differences between these models can be identified \nin their influence on risk perception and risk behavior. \nThese models represent system archetypes that are helpful for exploring \norganizational issues. Any actual concrete system is most likely a mix of these \nmodels, inheriting advantages and disadvantages of both. While we can make some \nassertions about the possible impact of this technology on power relationships, \nperception and safety behavior it is too early to answer the crucial \u2018big\u2019 question, if \nthe organization as a whole becomes more or less compliant as result of this \ntechnology, and if the technology actually contributes to a safer and healthier work \n       \nenvironment. Answering these questions will require more technology development, \nfield tests and observational studies.  \nAcknowledgements \nThis work has been supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research \nCouncil (EPSRC) project NEMO (EP\/C014677\/1) and the EU project CoBIs (IST \n004270).
