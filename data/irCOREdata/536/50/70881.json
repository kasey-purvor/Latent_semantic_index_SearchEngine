Low Temp. Phys. 145, 107-124 (2006).\nCharalambous et al\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe liquid phases of helium have a quantum character that endows them\nwith many remarkable properties1. In particular, the combination of weak\nVan der Waals interatomic forces and large zero-point energy results in both\nliquid 4He and liquid 3He having extremely low densities (respectively about\n3\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 less than for hard spheres in contact), such that the atoms are\nwell separated. Correspondingly, neither isotope solidifies under its satu-\nrated vapour pressure but apparently remains liquid right down to absolute\nzero. On account of their low densities, the liquids are in many ways gas-\nlike so that their quantum statistics play an important role in determining\ntheir physical properties. It is a role that becomes crucially important at\nlow temperatures where liquid 4He and liquid 3He behave respectively as de-\ngenerate, imperfect, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac gases. One of the most\nremarkable of their properties is superfluidity.\nFor both isotopes, the inviscid superfluid component (see Sec. 1.1. be-\nlow) is of particular interest for studies of turbulence, and experiments2\u20135\nare now starting to probe the low temperature regime of pure quantum tur-\nbulence (QT) where the dissipative normal fluid component is essentially\nabsent. Fundamental questions can be asked about QT under these condi-\ntions. One can enquire, for example, how classical turbulence is modified\nwhere flow is severely restricted by the quantization of angular velocity that\ngoverns the motion of the superfluid. One can also ask whether and, if so,\nhow the turbulence decays in the absence of viscosity.\nIn this paper we review recent experiments on pure QT in liquid 4He\nand consider some of those that are now being planned. In particular, we\nconsider the experimental problems that must be faced in the creation and\ndetection of QT at very low temperatures. For those who are unfamiliar with\nquantum fluids, we start by reviewing in Sec. 1.1. the salient properties of\nsuperfluid 4He. In Sec. 1.2. we introduce the concept of QT, and we mention\nsome early experiments relevant to QT in Sec. 1.3. In Sec. 2. we report results\nof on-going experiments on the production of QT with an oscillating grid,\ndiscussing the resonance curves (Sec. 2.1.), the hydrodynamic effective mass\n(Sec. 2.2.) and the temperature dependence of the critical velocity for QT\ncreation. We draw conclusions and consider future prospects in Sec. 3., both\nin relation to the grid resonances (Sec. 3.1.) and to possible new techniques\nfor creation and detection of QT (Sec. 3.2.).\nAs we will see, QT is not only of great intrinsic interest in its own right,\nbut its study could lead to a better understanding of classical turbulence.\nQuantum turbulence and oscillating grids\nFig. 1. The phase diagram of 4He at low temperatures, after London6.\n1.1. Superfluidity and dissipation\nAt its so-called Lambda transition at T\u03bb (= 2.17 K under the saturated\nvapour pressure), liquid 4He undergoes a phase transformation corresponding7\nto Bose-Einstein condensation. The P\u2013T phase diagram, shown schemat-\nically in Fig. 1, illustrates the facts that the liquid persists to the lowest\ntemperatures and that its properties above and below the Lambda transi-\ntion are utterly different. The He I phase above T\u03bb is a classical liquid, albeit\nof unusually small density and viscosity; He II, on the other hand, possesses\nsuperfluid properties such as zero viscosity allowing frictionless flow, quan-\ntization of circulation (i.e. of rotational motion, and the ability to climb out\nof open-topped containers by syphonic action via a creeping superfluid film.\nIn fact, He II behaves as though it were composed of two distinct in-\nterpenetrating but non-interacting components: a normal fluid component\nwith classical properties, which carries all the entropy (thermal energy); and\na superfluid component with zero entropy and zero viscosity that remains\neffectively at absolute zero. The densities of these two components, \u03c1n and\n\u03c1s respectively, vary with T as shown in Fig. 2. The normal fluid component\ncan be regarded as a gas of excitations8,9 (phonons and rotons) moving in the\n\u201cvacuum\u201d provided by the superfluid component. Near T\u03bb (say T > 1 K),\nCharalambous et al\nFig. 2. Temperature dependences of the normal and superfluid densities,\n\u03c1n and \u03c1s, divided by the total density \u03c1 of the liquid, as deduced from\nAndronikashvili\u2019s experiment14.\nthe mean free path of the excitations is very short, so that they behave like a\nclassical liquid. For the temperatures far below T\u03bb that will be the regime of\nour primary interest, the density of the excitations is so low that their mean\nfree path exceeds the dimensions of the container, and they then behave\nmuch like a classical Knudsen gas.\nIn addition to the phonons and rotons, quantized vortex lines10,11 can\nexist in the superfluid component. They have narrow cores around which\nthe superfluid component flows at a velocity vs that decreases inversely with\nthe radial distance from the centre, such that the circulation\n\u222e\nvs \u00b7 d\u2113 = n\nh\nm4\nwhere m4 is the\n4He atomic mass. In practice, the radius of the core is\nof vanishingly small (atomic) dimensions and n = 1. Vortex lines provide a\nmeans by which the superfluid can effectively rotate12, simulating solid body\nrotation for large enough angular velocities where a dense array of parallel\nlines is aligned with the axis of rotation. Vortex lines represent metastable\nstates of the stationary superfluid, but are known to have very long lifetimes\nwhen pinned between protuberances: seemingly, any sample of He II however\nprepared, always contains a low density of such remanent vortices13.\nIt is now understood that the inviscid properties of the superfluid com-\nponent persist only while the liquid is being treated fairly gently. If char-\nacteristic critical velocities are exceeded, the superfluidity breaks down and\nthere is an onset of dissipation through one of three main mechanisms \u2013\nQuantum turbulence and oscillating grids\nFig. 3. The measured drag force on a negative ion15 moving through He II at\n0.35 K, as a function of its speed v\u00af. It is found that drag occurs only when\nv\u00af is equal to, or exceeds, the Landau critical velocity for roton creation, vL.\nThe behaviour of a negative ion in He I at 4.0 K is also plotted, in order to\nemphasize the profound qualitative difference between the two cases.\n1. If a moving object (or the flowing liquid) exceeds the Landau critical\nvelocity vL \u2243 \u2206\/p0, where \u2206 and p0 are the energy and momentum\nof excitations at the roton minimum in the dispersion curve, then it\ndissipates kinetic energy through the emission of rotons15,16 via the\nmechanism predicted by Landau8,9. In experiments, it is found that\nthere is no measurable dissipation for v < vL, and that a sharp increase\noccurs above vL as shown in Fig. 3.\n2. It is also possible for a moving object to create quantized vortices in\nthe superfluid, a process that requires an energy barrier17 to be sur-\nmounted. Experiments on negative ions18 have revealed the existence\nof a vortex nucleation mechanism whose rate increases exponentially\nwith T , attributable to thermal activation over the barrier, as well as\na T -independent mechanism representing a form of macroscopic quan-\ntum tunnelling through the barrier. Measurements of the thermally\nactivated rate allow the height of the energy barrier to be determined\nand, as shown in Fig. 4, it is found to be in remarkably good agreement\nCharalambous et al\nFig. 4. Comparison of the energy barrier \u01eb opposing vortex nucleation by\na negative ion in superfluid 4He as calculated19 by Muirhead and Vinen\n(shaded) and measured experimentally18 (the bar on the right). \u2206E is the\nchange in energy that is calculated to occur when a vortex loop of radius\nR0 is created at constant impulse, and the numbers adjacent to the curves\nindicate the initial velocity of the ion in m s\u22121.\nwith the value estimated19 by Muirhead, Vinen and Donnelly by cal-\nculation of the energy change at constant impulse when a small vortex\nloop is created ab initio.\n3. Finally, is possible for remanent vortices13 (see above) to expand in the\nflowing liquid, eventually tangling, reconnecting20,21, and producing a\nbody of unpinned QT moving relative to the flow tube at a velocity\ndetermined by a balance between the superfluid and normal fluid ve-\nlocities vs and vn (the vortices lead to a mutual coupling of the fluids\nbecause their cores can scatter excitations and thus are part of the\nnormal fluid, whereas their flow fields and kinetic energy exist in the\nsuperfluid).\nOf these three mechanisms, the third is by far the commonest in practice,\nat least for flowing superfluid. One reason is that the corresponding critical\nvelocities (\u223c cm or mms\u22121) are very much smaller than those (\u223c 50\u201360\nm s\u22121) for the first two mechanisms.\nQuantum turbulence and oscillating grids\n1.2. Quantum turbulence\nWe now introduce the idea of QT and summarise its salient properties;\na more detailed introduction to QT will be found in the companion paper22\nby Vinen. Despite the huge differences between a superfluid and a classical\nfluid (the two-fluid behaviour, inviscid flow, and quantisation of circulation),\nit has become clear during the past four or five years that QT can often ex-\nhibit behaviour that is similar in significant respects to that observed in the\nappropriate classical analogue23,24. Perhaps the simplest case is provided by\nsteady flow through a uniform grid: in the classical case such flow generates\na form of fully-developed turbulence that is, at least approximately, homo-\ngeneous and isotropic, the detailed study of which has been important in\nthe development of our understanding of classical turbulence. The question\narises, therefore, as to how fully-developed grid turbulence is modified if the\nclassical fluid is replaced by superfluid 4He.\nAlmost all existing experiments relating to this question have been car-\nried out at temperatures above 1K, where there is a significant fraction of\nnormal fluid. Experiments have shown that, on length scales larger than\nthe spacing between the quantized vortex lines, the behaviour of the helium\nis quasi-classical, in the sense that the two fluids have a common turbulent\nvelocity field similar to the single velocity field observed in the inertial range\nof length scales in classical turbulence (i.e. the range in which there is neg-\nligible viscous damping); the evolution of this velocity field is characterized\nby a Richardson cascade and a classical Kolmogorov spectrum. It can be\nargued, however, that this behaviour may be dependent on the presence of\nthe normal fluid. Thus it becomes important to establish whether it persists\nat the very low temperatures where the fraction of normal fluid has become\nnegligible.\nClassical turbulent flow, including that produced by flow through a grid,\nis ultimately dissipated on a small length scale by viscosity. Such a process\ncannot operate in the superfluid component. Yet without such dissipation\nthere cannot be a Richardson cascade and its associated Kolmogorov spec-\ntrum. There is evidence25 that at temperatures above 1K, turbulence in\nthe superfluid component is dissipated on small length scales (less than or\nof order the vortex-line spacing) by mutual friction \u2013 the force that is ex-\nerted on the core of a quantized vortex line when there is relative motion\nbetween the line and the normal fluid. A dissipative process of this kind\nobviously cannot operate at the lowest temperatures, so another motivation\nfor investigation of QT at these temperatures is to establish the nature of\nthe dissipative processes that are able to operate.\nThese low-temperature dissipative processes have attracted much theo-\nCharalambous et al\nretical speculation25, and they are of fundamental importance to our under-\nstanding of QT. From computer simulations, it seems likely that there are\nthree significant mechanisms, all arising from the vortex reconnections21 that\ncan occur when two sections of vortex line come close enough to each other.\nFirst, the vortex reconnection process itself probably leads to the emission\nof phonons and\/or rotons; it is therefore inherently dissipative, although the\nmagnitude of the associated dissipation rate is probably relatively small in\n4He. Secondly, reconnections lead also to the generation of sharp kinks on\nthe vortex lines, which can be regarded as superpositions of Kelvin waves.\nThese waves can dissipate energy by phonon radiation, but only at a very\nsmall rate unless they have very high frequencies, higher than are generated\ndirectly by reconnections. However, repeated reconnections lead to the gen-\neration of Kelvin waves of high amplitude. Non-linear interactions can then\ntransfer energy, through a \u201cKelvin-wave cascade\u201d, to waves with frequen-\ncies high enough for effective phonon radiation26\u201328. Finally, reconnections\ncan lead to the generation of small vortex rings, which can escape from a\nturbulent region of finite extent. Experimental evidence should enable this\npicture to be tested because it leads to clear predictions about the rate of\ndecay of the turbulence25.\n1.3. Early experiments pertaining to QT for T \u2192 0\nIn fact, interest in how QT decays preceded by several years the theory\nsketched in outline above. Experiments using negative ions to measure the\nLandau critical velocity 15,29,16 involved periodic injection of ions from field\nemission tips, and the ions were necessarily subjected to strong electric fields\nbefore they entered the drift space. Under these conditions, they are known\nto have a finite probability of creating charged vortex rings30,31,18,32 even for\npressures above 10 bar using 4He that has been isotopically purified to elimi-\nnate complications33 caused by tiny traces of 3He present in natural helium.\nThe reason is that the distribution function of ionic velocities possesses a\nhigh velocity tail34 that crosses the threshold for vortex creation despite the\nlatter being considerably above vL. In extremely high electric fields, close to\nthe field emmitter, production of vortex line is continuous35 without trap-\nping of the ion; in lower fields, metastable charged vortex rings36 are created\nand these may be expected to grow, decelerate, and eventually to tangle\nwith each other. Thus there must have been continuous creation of QT in\nsuch experiments. If there had not been simultaneous QT decay processes,\nthen the density of QT would have increased until the trapped spacecharge\nprevented continuation of the experiments. That this did not occur implied\nQuantum turbulence and oscillating grids\nFig. 5. Top: experimental arrangement (schematic) for measuring QT decay\ntimes. Bottom: evolution of the collector signal with time following a burst\nof grid oscillations.\nthe existence of QT decay mechanisms, effective even at mK temperatures.\nIt was noted29, however, that the decay times could apparently be very long.\nThe first attempt to measure the QT decay time directly2 used the ap-\nparatus sketched in the top section of Fig. 5. The grid is held at a high\nconstant potential. The perforated top and bottom electrodes complete the\ndouble capacitor, and oscillations of the grid are excited by application of an\nalternating potential to the lower electrode. In the absence of any dissipa-\ntion from the superfluid, the oscillation amplitude increases until a critical\nvelocity for vortex production is reached. A sequence of ion pulses is then\ngenerated by the field emission tip. Some ions from each pulse get trapped\non vortices, thereby reducing the signal arriving at the collector. The Frisch\ngrid screens the collector from the approaching charge. The bottom section\nof Fig. 5 plots the evolution of the collector signal with time following a\nburst of grid oscillations, for different values of T . It is evident that the re-\ncovery of the signal amplitude to its vortex-free level takes several seconds,\nattributable to the time taken for the vorticity to decay. This experiment\nwas illuminating in that it clearly demonstrated the production and decay\nCharalambous et al\nof QT in the T \u2192 0 limit, but it suffered from two disadvantages. First, the\nabsolute value of the vortex density was unknown: the vortex\/ion trapping\ncross-section has not yet been measured at these temperatures, although it\nis evidently small37. Secondly, the distribution of QT \u2013 whether it diffuses\nwidely within the cell, or remains concentrated near the grid that produces\nit \u2013 is also unknown.\n2. THE OSCILLATING GRID\nThe dynamics of the grid oscillations themselves also turns out to be of\nconsiderable interest, given that they take place in a pure superfluid. The ex-\nperimental situation still includes features that require resolution, although\nthe general picture is clear. We now describe the linear and nonlinear reso-\nnances that have been observed, measurements of the hydrodynamic effective\nmass, and our observation that the threshold velocity for vortex creation is\ntemperature dependent.\n2.1. Linear v. nonlinear resonances\nFor small amplitude oscillations in the T \u2192 0 limit where \u03c1n \u2243 0, the\nliquid exerts essentially no damping. The liquid is expected to behave much\nlike a vacuum, except that backflow will result in the classical hydrodynamic\ncontribution to the effective mass (see Sec. 2.2.). Recent experiments38 con-\nfirm this general picture. Typical resonance curves are plotted for a number\nof different driving amplitudes in Fig. 6, which shows the amplitude of the\noscillating response voltage induced on the upper electrode: note the loga-\nrithmic ordinate scale and the highly expanded abscissa. It is found that,\nfor driving voltages of 20 mV or less, the response varies linearly with the\ndrive and the resonances are Lorentzian. For larger drives, the response\namplitude on-resonance increases much more slowly, and the curves become\nflat-topped. These phenomena are attributable to the onset of dissipation\nvia vortex production once the grid exceeds a characteristic critical velocity\nof \u223c4.5 cm\/s.\nThe initial experimental investigations39,40 yielded data that differ in\ncertain respects from the results plotted in Fig. 6. In particular, although\nthe resonance curves for large and small drives are very similar, there was\na range of intermediate driving levels and responses where the resonant fre-\nquency (i.e. the frequency of maximum response) decreased with rising drive\namplitude; and the resonance curves were of a re-entrant shape and displayed\nhysteresis. Nonetheless, the on-resonance response amplitude remained pro-\nQuantum turbulence and oscillating grids\nFig. 6. Resonance curves for the vibrating grid in He II at 20 mK, for the\ndriving amplitudes (mV) indicated by the number adjacent to each curve.\nportional to the driving amplitude until the vortex production threshold was\nreached. It is not known why the more recent data (Fig. 6) do not reproduce\nthese phenomena. The difference may possibly be associated with the surface\npreparation and quality of the gold plating of the grid which, in the earlier\nwork, was darker and less golden in appearance. Further experimental work\nis needed to resolve these issues.\n2.2. The effective mass\nFrom classical hydrodynamics, the inertia associated with the backflow\naround a moving object implies an effective mass enhancement of \u2206M =\n\u03b2V \u033a. Here \u03b2 is a geometrical constant, V is the volume of the displaced fluid,\nand \u033a is the fluid density. An important feature of 4He is that adjustment\nof the pressure p causes significant changes in \u033a (on account of the high zero\nCharalambous et al\npoint energy and the resultant low density: see Sec. 1.). Thus it is possible\nto adjust the hydrodoynamic effective mass. If we consider the system as\nlinear oscillator driven by a periodic force F0 cos(\u03c9t), we can write\nMz\u00a8 +Dz\u02d9 +Kz = F0 cos(\u03c9t) (1)\nwhere M is the mass, D specifies the (small) damping, and K is a spring\nconstant. The response is maximum for f = \u03c9\/2\u03c0 \u223c= 12pi\n\u221a\nK\/M . Because\nM = V \u033aNi+\u03b2V \u033aHe, where \u033aNi and \u033aHe are respectively the densities of the\nnickel grid material and the liquid 4He,\n4\u03c02f21 =\nK\nV \u033aNi + \u03b2V \u033aHe(p)\n(2)\n4\u03c02f20 =\nK\nV \u033aNi\n(3)\nHere f0 is the frequency of vacuum resonance and f1 is that of the helium\nresonance. Dividing the last two equations,\n(\nf0\nf1\n)2\n=\n\u033aNi + \u03b2\u033aHe(p)\n\u033aNi\n(4)\nwhence\n1\nf21\n=\n(\n\u03b2\nf20\u033aNi\n)\n\u033aHe(p) +\n1\nf20\n(5)\nHence a plot of 1\/f21 versus \u033aHe(p) should yield a straight line from which\n\u03b2 may be extracted. It was found40 that a straight line was indeed obtained\nwithin experimental error, and that this passed through the vacuum reso-\nnance point (for which \u033aHe(p) = 0). Its gradient gave \u03b2 = 3.01\u00b1 0.05. This\nvalue is to be compared with \u03b2 = 0.5 for a sphere, or \u03b2 = 1 for an infinite\ncylinder, or \u03b2 = 3 for an elliptical cylinder with major and minor axes equal\nto the width and thickness of a grid wire.\nSubsequent more accurate measurements were found41 to yield a straight\nline that did not pass precisely through the vacuum point. The reason is not\nyet known, but it could possibly be an indication of an additional contribu-\ntion to the effective mass, a feature that has also been seen in experiments\non vibrating wire loops42.\n2.3. Temperature dependences\nMeasurements at a range of temperatures38 show a broadening of the\nresonances above \u223c200 mK. The broadening increases up to \u223c1 K, where it\nQuantum turbulence and oscillating grids\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n6.5\n7\n7.5\n8\n8.5\nTemperature \/ mK\nM\nax\n. g\nrid\n s\npe\ned\n \/ \ncm\n s\u2212\n1\nFig. 7. The resonant response at the onset of dissipation as a function of\ntemperature, at a pressure of 15 bar.\npasses through a maximum. This added damping can be attributed to an\nincreasing fraction of thermally excited quasiparticles, i.e. increasing \u03c1n as T\nrises. At temperatures below 1 K the mean free path of the quasiparticles is\nmuch larger than the mesh of the grid, and the dissipative drag arises from\nthe ballistic scattering of quasiparticles from the grid. This type of behavior\nwas reported by Ja\u00a8ger et al.43 for the case of an oscillating microsphere, and\nthey showed that it leads to a drag coefficient that increases monotonically\nwith temperature, in agreement with our own results. At temperatures above\n1 K the mean free path of the quasiparticles falls below the diameter of the\nwires in the grid, so that the damping can then be described in terms of a\nviscous drag. As in the measurements of Ja\u00a8ger et al., this change leads to\nthe maximum in the damping versus temperature that we have observed.\nThe temperature dependence of the critical velocity associated with the\nonset of vortex production is plotted in Fig. 7. It is interesting to note\nthat the critical velocities associated with the vibration of a single wire42,44,\nor with the oscillation of a microsphere43, are very similar in magnitude\nand that, at least qualitatively, there are similar temperature dependences.\nThese similarities exist notwithstanding the very different geometries. In the\ncase of wires it seems not to depend much on the surface roughness of the\nwire, in spite of the fact that this roughness might be expected to have a\nstrong influence on any remanent vortices.\nCharalambous et al\n3. DISCUSSION: WHERE NEXT?\nThe experiments discussed above lead naturally to two lines of future\ndevelopment. First, studies of the grid resonances have revealed many un-\nexpected and poorly understood features that need to be investigated in\nmore detail. Secondly, and as discussed below probably of greater long-term\nimportance, we have helped to open up the possibility of studying QT in\npure superfluids in the T \u2192 0 limit. Before discussing possible future exper-\niments, we should take note of the increasingly important role being played\nby numerical simulation45,25,46,47, which has evolved into a highly sophisti-\ncated technique that is able to provide answers to questions that experiments\nare not yet able to address.\n3.1. Grid resonances\nAs noted above, the onset of dissipation due to vortex production by\nthe grid seems to be very similar to that in the case of oscillating wires and\nspheres. Many features of the results at lower grid velocity remain myste-\nrious, however. These include the presence39,40 or absence41,38 of re-entrant\nresonance curves, the observation of bursts of modulation in the response\namplitude39,40, and the occurrence of small resonant shifts in very low am-\nplitude oscillations38 that occur discontinuously without measurable changes\nin damping. The possible effect of surface preparation of the grid needs to\nbe investigated. The seemingly anomalous contribution to the effective mass\nneeds to be checked and understood. There is also a parasitic resonance38\n(not mentioned above) whose origin needs to be identified. Thus studies of\nan oscillating grid in superfluid 4He in the T \u2192 0 limit should still be con-\nsidered as work in progress with the possibility of some additional surprises\nin store.\n3.2. Quantum turbulence experiments in 4He\nThe preliminary QT experiments discussed above in Sec. 1.3. need to be\ndeveloped and improved, to create well-characterised spatially homogeneous\nQT. Improved QT detection techniques are also needed because ion-trapping\nis inherently insensitive on account of the small cross-section37 of the process.\nA drawn-grid technique for the production of homogeneous QT at mK\ntemperatures is currently under development in Gainesville48 and Lancaster41.\nAlthough conceptually similar to the earlier T > 1K QT drawn-grid appa-\nratus in Oregon24, there are daunting technical problems to be overcome,\nQuantum turbulence and oscillating grids\ngiven the need to avoid extraneous heating of the sample. A superconduct-\ning linear motor is being used to move the grid which, together with levitated\nsuperconducting magnetic quadrupole bearings will eliminate frictional ef-\nfects. At the time of writing, the machine has been tested at T > 1K, where\nit performs according to expectation.\nTwo alternative methods for detecting QT are under active investiga-\ntion. The first is the possible use49,50 of small charged vortex rings36 as\nprobes of QT. They have a much larger interaction cross-section than bare\nions, but an obvious concern is that it may prove difficult to create monoen-\nergetic rings of known radius (or energy) in a controlled way. The second\nQT detection method depends on measurement of the rise in temperature of\nthe helium as the turbulence decays: the idea that turbulent energies can be\nhigh enough to produce measurable heating at low temperatures was sug-\ngested by Samuels and Barenghi51 and developed by Vinen52. The thermal\ncapacity of the thermometers required must of course be small compared to\nthat of the surrounding helium; their response time must be relatively fast\n(1 ms); and they must have adequate sensitivity (1 \u00b5K at an ambient tem-\nperature of 10 mK). Suitable thermometers meeting these stringent criteria\nare now available53,54. The theory of the decay of quantum turbulence at\nlow temperatures, outlined in Sec. 1.2., leads to predicted time-dependent\ntemperature rises, which can in principle be compared with the results of the\nexperiments. Relevant factors include the rate of transfer of energy down the\nRichardson cascade (known from the theory of classical turbulence), the rate\nof build-up of the Kelvin-wave cascade and of energy flow within it (known\nfrom simulations25,28, the rate of phonon radiation from the high-frequency\nKelvin waves (known from theory55\u201357, and the rate of thermal equilibration\nwithin the radiated phonons (which may also involve the vessel containing\nthe experimental helium, about which less is known).\nUnfortunately, neither ion-trapping nor calorimetry will provide the\nkind of detailed information about turbulent flow patterns that is avail-\nable in the case of classical turbulence. Such patterns can be obtained in\nclassical fluids by observing the motion of seed particles in the flow, and a\nsophisticated development of this type of observation is provided by Particle\nImage Velocimetry (PIV). Experiments on PIV in thermal counterflow in\nsuperfluid 4He above 1K have recently been reported58, as have preliminary\nobservations of the trapping of micron-sized particles of solid hydrogen by\nvortex lines59; the first steps towards a theory of particle motion in a super-\nfluid have been made60. It is becoming clear that a simple interpretation\nof this observed particle motion is dependent on the right choice of parti-\ncle size61. It has recently been suggested by McKinsey62 that the neutral\ntriplet-state He2 excimer molecule, produced along with other excitations\nCharalambous et al\nby charged particle bombardment of helium, might be useful as a tracer, es-\npecially as laser-induced fluorescence might be used for extremely sensitive\ndetection, possibly even at the level of individual molecules. It turns out\nthat these molecules form bubble states that are of the appropriate size for\ntrapping on vortices. Development of the use of these tracer particles might\nin the long term revolutionize the study of quantum turbulence.\n3.3. Quantum turbulence experiments in 3He\nOur discussion above has referred to 4He, but it is becoming increas-\ningly apparent22,63 that QT in 3He-B has much in common with QT in 4He,\nalthough there are also some differences. The 3He-B experiments of Bradley\net al3\u20135 have investigated QT production by looking at the dynamics of\nvibrating loops and grids, and have detected the QT by means of Andreev\nreflection. It has been possible to detect the decrease in QT density with dis-\ntance from the creation region, and to show that a characteristic generation\nrate must be exceeded for QT to be created rather than individual vortex\nrings which escape rapidly. These results are highly illuminating, but \u2013 as\nwith any oscillating object \u2013 they are difficult to compare in detail with the-\nory because the QT is spatially inhomogeneous and not well-characterised in\nlength scale. It is possible in principle that a drawn-grid experiment, similar\nto that being planned for 4He (see above) might be attempted.\n4. CONCLUSION\nWe conclude that the experimental study of QT in pure superfluids is\nimportant, and has made significant progress recently, but that the subject\nis still in its infancy. Nonetheless, a coherent picture is already starting to\nemerge. Considerable development may be anticipated over the next few\nyears, both experimentally using both isotopes, numerically, and theoreti-\ncally.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge the continuing collaboration and support\nof W.
