INTRODUCTION AND THEORY\nUtilization of the electron spin in semiconductors, or spin-\ntronics, has become a focus of interest in recent years \u0001for a\nrecent review see Ref. 1\u0002. Proposed spin transistor\narchitectures2 require that spins can be transported through\nthe semiconductor with long lifetime and coherently manipu-\nlated in transit. The prime candidate for electrical spin ma-\nnipulation expoits the Rashba effect in low-dimensional\nstructures,3\u20136 and there has been a great number of studies of\nthe spin lifetime and manipulation in GaAs-based systems\nusing optical orientation techniques with pulsed lasers.6\u201311\nOn the other hand, relatively little attention has been paid to\nnarrow gap semiconductors \u0001NGSs\u0002, even though they may\nbe important in future spintronics applications because of\ntheir high Rashba effect,3\u20135 g factor \u0001see below\u0002 and\nmobility,12,13 etc. Indeed observation of electrical injection\nwith subsequent long spin mean free path has been reported\nin NGS quantum wells.14 Originally spin lifetimes in NGSs\nwere studied only with spin-resonance techniques at low\ntemperature15,16 because of the need for long wavelength\nlight sources.17\u201320\nWe report measurement of the spin relaxation between\n300 and 77 K in bulk n-InAs \u0001in agreement with earlier\nwork17,18 at 300 K\u0002 and over the range 5.2\u00011016 to 8.8\n\u00011018 cm\u22123. Our results are consistent with the so-called\nD\u2019yakonov-Perel \u0001DP\u0002 \u0001Refs. 21 and 22\u0002 mechanism which\nis important for spintronic devices because dominance of the\nDP mechanism, and a strong Rashba effect are necessary for\ngate modulation of spin populations.6 The other main spin\nrelaxation process due to Elliott and Yafet23 \u0001EY\u0002 predicts\nlifetimes much longer than observed. We show further that\nincluding the effect of electron-electron scattering greatly\nimproves the agreement of the DP prediction with experi-\nment. \u0001The Bir-Aronov-Pikus24,25 mechanism, by contrast\nwith the other two processes, only exists in the presence of\nholes. It is thought to be particularly important in p-type\nwide gap materials and is based on the electron-hole ex-\nchange interaction,10,22 and we ignore it here.\u0002\nThe EY mechanism results from the fact that in real crys-\ntals Bloch states are not spin eigenstates because of the\nstrong spin-orbit coupling induced by the lattice ions, which\nresults in the valence band states having mixed spin charac-\nter. In NGSs the conduction electron states, in turn, are\nstrongly mixed with the valence states through the k \u00b7p in-\nteraction across a narrow energy gap. In this case spin-\nindependent interactions with impurities, boundaries,\nphonons, etc., can connect spin up and down electrons, lead-\ning to spin flip transitions whose rate 1 \/\u0003s is proportional to\n1\/\u0003p where \u0003p is the orbital momentum \u0001mobility\u0002 scattering\ntime.

Typically spin lifetimes in the range\n1\u201310 ns were obtained from spin resonance in degenerate\nn-type InSb at helium temperatures, whereas a spin lifetime\nof 20 ps was reported for lightly n-type InAs at 300 K. For\nlarger gap materials the DP mechanism has been shown to\ndominate at 300 K,1,6\u201310,22 but the subject remains somewhat\ncontroversial since for the smaller gap InGaAs quantum\nwells the EY process has been claimed to dominate.26\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe samples used here were grown by MBE, Si doped, on\nsemi-insulating GaAs.13 The low concentration sample\nIC313 was 3-\bm thick \u0001strain relaxed\u0002 and had a room-\ntemperature electron concentration and mobility of n=5.2\n\u00011016 cm\u22123 and \b=16400 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, respectively.\nIC311 \u00014-\bm thick\u0002 had n=1.22\u00011017 cm\u22123 ,\b\n=17 200 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121, and IC301 had n=8.8\u00011017 cm\u22123 ,\b\n=12 000 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. The temperature dependence of the\nconcentration and hall mobility for IC313 and IC311 are\nshown in Fig. 1. As is usual, lattice scattering becomes a\nsignificant contribution to the mobility at high temperatures.\nWe have performed circularly polarized pump-probe ex-\nperiments as described elsewhere.9,17,18 The light source was\na difference frequency generator, which mixes the signal and\nidler beams of an optical parametric amplifier, itself pumped\nby an amplified Ti:sapphire oscillator. The pulses had a du-\nration of order 100 fs. The time resolution of the experiments\nas measured from the leading edge of the pump-probe data\nwas about 200 fs. In such measurements it is common to use\nquarter-wave plates to circularly polarize the pump and\nprobe beams. The transient absorption bleaching of the probe\nis then measured for pump and probe beams having the same\ncircular polarization \u0001SCP\u0002 and then the opposite \u0001OCP\u0002 by\nrotating one of the quarter-wave plates by 90\u00b0. The sum of\nthese signals is a measure of the total population recombina-\ntion and reproduces the linearly polarized result, whereas the\ndifference is a measure of the population spin-polarization.\nThe technique therefore measures which ever is the shorter\nof the spin flip scattering by EY \u0001T1\u0002 or spin dephasing by\nDP \u0001T2\u0002. The optical polarization defined by\nPopt =\n\u0006TSCP \u2212 \u0006TOCP\n\u0006TSCP + \u0006TOCP\n=\n\u0006TSCP \u2212 \u0006TOCP\n\u0006TLP\n= P0 exp\u0001\u2212 t\/\u0003s\u0002 ,\n\u00015\u0002\nwhere \u0006T is the probe transmission change, which decays\nexponentially with a decay constant equal to the spin life-\ntime. P0 is a constant that depends on the matrix elements\nand is 0.25 at best for bulk III-V semiconductors.17\nWe used a ZnSe photoelastic modulator \u0001PEM\u0002 to modu-\nlate the polarization of the pump.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 085346 \u00012005\u0002\n085346-2\nintensity observed was of order 0.1%, which is due to imper-\nfect circular polarization and unequal reflection coefficients\nof the mirror for the in-plane and out-of-plane components.\nFor this reason the pump was placed at normal incidence to\nthe sample with no optical components between it and the\nPEM and the sample except for a cryostat window, also at\nnormal incidence. Under these circumstances, when a detec-\ntor was placed at the sample position no modulation of in-\ntensity could be seen. The probe was circularly polarized\nwith a variable quarter wave plate which was not altered\nduring the experiment. The probe polarization was calibrated\nbefore the experiment with a polarizer immediately in front\nof the sample position, so that polarization changes on sub-\nsequent reflections etc. downstream from the probe wave-\nplate were compensated.\nWe applied a small external magnetic field in the sample\nplane \u0001the Voigt configuration\u0002. The spins injected by the\nnormal incidence pump beam are polarized normal to the\nsample and undergo Larmor precession about the magnetic\nfield axis. The measured polarization oscillates at angular\nfrequency g*\bBB \/q while decaying with the spin lifetime.\nHere g* is the Lande g factor, \bB is the Bohr magneton, and\nB is the magnetic field. The results for B=0.1 T at T\n=300 K for sample IC311, shown in Fig. 2, are very well\nfitted by a simple exponentially decaying sinusoid with zero\nbackground. The magnitude of the g factor from the fit is\n\u0007g*\u0007=13.4\u00b10.1 \u0001the measurement does not reveal the sign,\nwhich is known to be negative for InAs\u0002, and the lifetime is\n\u0003s=24.4\u00b10.4 ps. Estimates of the error from the scatter in\nrepeat measurements \u0001below\u0002 were rather higher at 10%. The\nmagnetic field was removed for all further experiments de-\nscribed here, and the field and temperature dependence of g*\nwill be described elsewhere.\nThe temperature dependences of the spin relaxation time\nfor samples IC313 and IC311 are shown in Fig. 3. The data\nfor each sample include two separate temperature runs, and\nthe scatter in the data is an indication of the uncertainty. The\nwavelength was tuned at each temperature to the InAs band\nedge. We note that the laser pulses are very short and conse-\nquently have a large spectral width of about 4%, or about\n0.015 eV, and the results are rather insensitive to fine tuning\nof the laser.\nWe have also measured the spin relaxation time at room\ntemperature of sample IC301. The comparison of the three\ndifferent samples is shown in Fig. 4 for temperatures 200 and\n300 K.\nIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nFigure 3 also shows theoretical predictions for sample\nIC311 from Ref. 22 and Eqs. \u00013\u0002 and \u00014\u0002. In Ref. 22 mobility\nvalues are used that do not correspond precisely with our\nmeasured mobility \bFig. 1\u0001a\u0002\t, the experimentally determined\ntemperature dependence of which we used for calculation of\n\u0003p \bFig. 1\u0001b\u0002\t. The value of \u0003s calculated from the degenerate\nmodel begins to rise rapidly with increasing temperature as\nthe crossover with the nondegenerate regime is approached\ndue to the fact that EF starts to drop. As mentioned above the\npredicted constants of proportionality Qnd and Qd are be-\ntween 0.1 and 3 depending on the electron statistics and the\norbital scattering process, and we have therefore treated them\nas free parameters. We chose a value of Qnd=1.5 for the\nnondegenerate model curve shown on Fig. 3, to give a good\nmatch with the more sophisticated calculations of Ref. 27\n\u0001the data of which are for a value of carrier concentration\nwell below degeneracy and much lower than for the samples\nconsidered here\u0002. Reference 22 gives predictions also for\nhigh concentrations \u0001the data shown here are for 1\n\u00011017 cm\u22123\u0002. However, their model ignores degeneracy ef-\nfects and as can be seen from Fig. 3 their prediction runs\nFIG. 2.

For sample IC313 the\nconcentration is lower, at n=5.2\u00011016 cm\u22123, but even here\nthe chemical potential is always within kT of the band edge\nfor the temperatures used. It is therefore to be expected that\nthe transition from the degenerate to the nondegenerate mod-\nels is within this range, and it may be that this is the reason\nfor the experimentally determined temperature dependence\nof the spin lifetime being intermediate between the two re-\ngimes for both samples.\nTo identify the spin relaxation mechanism, we note that\nthe EY model in both limits \u0001degenerate and nondegenerate\u0002\ngives a spin relaxation time substantially larger than the mea-\nsured spin lifetime at all temperatures used, i.e., above 80 K.\nFor example, for sample IC311 the lifetime predicted from\nthe EY model \bEq. \u00011\u0002\t is 180 ps at 300 K; see the insets of\nFigs. 3 and 4. Hence the magnitude and the functional form\nof the temperature dependence of the EY mechanism suggest\nthat it is not playing a dominant role here.\nNow we turn to Fig. 4 which shows that the lifetime has a\nrelatively weak dependence on carrier concentration. Both\nthe remarkable result that we have an initial rise and also the\nsmall subsequent drop in lifetime with concentration are not\npossible to understand using the measured mobility time in\nthe simple models of Eqs. \u00011\u0002\u2013\u00014\u0002. As shown in the inset of\nFig. 4 the simple DP model predicts a nearly constant spin\nlifetime for nondegenerate concentrations because \u0003p\u0001300 K\u0002\nis nearly constant. This is followed by a predicted very\nstrong decrease at degenerate concentrations due to the\nEF3\u0001\tn2\u0002 factor.\nElectron-electron scattering modifies this picture strongly.\nThis process does not contribute to the mobility because it\nconserves total momentum, but contributes to the DP process\nby causing k and hence \u0001 to perform a random walk. Hence\nthe mobility time \u0003p in Eqs. \u00011\u0002\u2013\u00014\u0002 should really be replaced\nby \u0003= \u0001\u0003p\u22121+\u0003p*\u22121\u0002\u22121, where \u0003p* is the electron-electron scat-\ntering time.11,28,29 Although the case for the dominance of\nelectron-electron scattering may be more obvious for re-\nmotely doped 2D gases at low temperatures11 we also find\njustification for invoking this process in our case. The calcu-\nlated lattice contribution to the mobility at 300 K is via polar\noptical phonons with a mobility of 3.6 m2 V\u22121 s\u22121, whereas\nthe Brooks-Herring mobility for ionized impurity scattering\nat 5.2\u00011016 cm\u22123 is 3.8 m2 V\u22121 s\u22121 \u0001decreasing with con-\ncentration\u0002. Very similar values are obtained by an empirical\nfit of the two contributions to the experimental mobility \u0001Fig.\n1\u0002. The lattice and impurity contributions to \u0003p and also to \u0003\nare therefore comparable at 300 K in our samples. Detailed\ncalculations29 have shown that the contribution to DP spin\nrelaxation from electron-electron scattering is 2.5 times\ngreater than that from ionized-impurity scattering in bulk\nmaterials. This implies that electron-electron scattering may\nindeed play a more significant role for DP than either lattice\nor ionized impurity scattering, even at room temperature, and\nespecially for the intermediate and highly doped samples.\nThe mean free path between electron-electron scattering\nevents, and hence also \u0003p*, is proportional to the volume per\nelectron 1\/n.29 If we assume electron-electron scattering\ndominates \u0001\u0003\n\u0003p*\u0002 then the nondegenerate model \bEq. \u00013\u0002\t\nnow becomes \u0003s\tn, so going from IC313 to IC311 the car-\nrier concentration increase by a factor of 2 causes a rise of a\nfactor of 2 in the spin lifetime, in agreement with the experi-\nmental result \u0001see Fig. 4\u0002. This initial increase of \u0003s with\nconcentration is also consistent with \u0001though not as pro-\nnounced as\u0002 our earlier observations.18 Using the degenerate\nmodel \bEq. \u00014\u0002\t and electron-electron scattering the net con-\ncentration dependence is now \u0003s\tn\u22121 \u0001since EF3\tn2\u0002 so the\nexpected change in spin lifetime from IC311 to IC301 is now\nmuch closer to the observation \u0001also Fig. 4\u0002. The remaining\ndiscrepancy is likely to be due to the absence of full degen-\neracy for IC311.\nIn summary, we have measured the dependence of the\nspin relaxation time on temperature between 77 and 300 K,\nand for doping densities between 5.2\u00011016 and 8.8\n\u00011017 cm\u22123 for n-InAs. The maximum lifetime at room tem-\nperature was 24 ps for the intermediate doping, and all the\nlifetimes were within the range 5 to 50 ps. Within the ap-\nproximations of Eqs. \u00011\u0002\u2013\u00014\u0002, the magnitude and temperature\ndependence of the results are in accord with the DP spin\nrelaxation mechanism particularly if electron-electron scat-\ntering is taken into account.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful for partial support from the EU FENIKS\nproject \u0001EC: Grant No. G5RD-CT-2001-00535\u0002, and from\nthe UK EPSRC.\nFIG. 4.
