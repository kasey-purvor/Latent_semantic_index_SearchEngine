Introduction\n[2] The coupling of the Van Allen radiation belts to the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere through precipitating particles is an area\nof intense scientific interest, principally due to two differing\nresearch activities. One of these concerns the physics of the\nradiation belts, and primarily the evolution of energetic\nelectron fluxes during and after geomagnetic storms [e.g.,\nReeves et al., 2003]. The other focuses on the response of\nthe atmosphere to precipitating particles, with a possible\nlinkage to climate variability [e.g., Turunen et al., 2009].\nBoth scientific areas require increased understanding of the\nnature of the precipitation, particularly as to the precipitation\ndrivers, as well as the variation of the flux and energy\nspectrum for electrons lost from the outer radiation belts.\n[3] Essentially all geomagnetic storms substantially alter\nthe electron radiation belt populations, reflecting accelera-\ntion, loss, and transport processes [Reeves et al., 2003,\n2009], in which precipitation losses into the atmosphere\nplay a major role [Green et al., 2004]. A significant fraction\nof all of the particles lost are precipitated into the atmo-\nsphere [Lorentzen et al., 2001; Horne, 2002; Friedel et al.,\n2002; Clilverd et al., 2006], although storm\u2010time nonadia-\nbatic magnetic field changes also lead to losses through\nmagnetopause shadowing [e.g., Ukhorskiy et al., 2006]. The\ngeomagnetic activity which drives the radiation belt vari-\nability [Friedel et al., 2002] may come from either high\u2010\nspeed solar wind\u2010streams (HSSWS) in the solar wind or the\narrival of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs).\nWhile ICMEs are the main source of geomagnetic storms at\nsolar maximum, the declining and minimum phase of the\n11\u2010year solar activity cycle is characterized by an increase in\nthe occurrence rate of high\u2010speed (>500 km\/s) solar wind\u2010\nstreams emanating from coronal holes [Richardson et al.,\n2000].\n[4] Recently there has been much interest in the varying\nresponses of the radiation belt to HSSWS and ICMEs\n[Borovsky and Denton, 2006]. Although HSSWS events are\nnot typically associated with large signatures in the Dst\nindex (min > \u221250 nT), they do produce moderate levels of\n1Department of Physics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.\n2Physical Sciences Division, British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge,\nUK.\n3Space Weather Prediction Center, NOAA, Boulder, Colorado, USA.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2008JA014023\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A04202, doi:10.1029\/2008JA014023, 2010\nA04202 1 of 13\ngeomagnetic activity that persist for many days. In con-\ntrast, ICME events are more transient, driving high geo-\nmagnetic activity for typically only 1\u20132 days [Richardson\net al., 2000]. As such, the energy input to the magneto-\nsphere during HSSWS events is believed to be comparable\nto or to exceed the energy input to the magnetosphere\nduring ICMEs. It has been suggested that there are more\nlong\u2010lasting radiation belt electron flux enhancements in\nHSSWS\u2010driven storms compared to ICME\u2010driven storms\n[Miyoshi and Kataoka, 2005], that the flux of higher\u2010energy\nparticles peak later in time, and that many magnetospheric\nelectromagnetic wave processes are enhanced [Hilmer et al.,\n2000; Vassiliadis et al., 2007].\n[5] The impact of precipitating particles on the environ-\nment of the Earth is also an area of current scientific focus.\nPrecipitating charged particles produce odd nitrogen NOx\n(NO + NO2) in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which can catalyt-\nically destroy ozone [Brasseur and Solomon, 2005]. As a\nresult, energetic particle precipitation (EPP) events have\nbeen linked to significant decreases in polar ozone in the\nupper stratosphere [e.g., Randall et al., 2005]. Multiple\nobservations undertaken during the Arctic winter of 2003\u2013\n2004 showed two periods of EPP\u2010linked polar ozone loss at\n\u223c40 km altitude, with decreases of \u223c30% and \u223c17%\n[Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2007]. By influencing stratospheric ozone\nvariability, EPP can affect the stratospheric radiative balance\nand may link to climate variability. Rozanov et al. [2005]\nimposed a NOx source calculated from 1987 NOAA TIROS\nspacecraft EEP measurements to represent this linkage into\ntheir chemistry\u2010climate model and found large (\u00b12 K) var-\niations in polar surface air temperatures. They concluded\nthat the magnitude of the atmospheric response to EEP\nevents can potentially exceed the effects from solar UV\nfluxes. Very recently, the pattern and magnitude of the polar\nsurface air temperature\u2010variability predicted by Rozanov\net al. [2005] has been observed in European Centre for\nMedium\u2010Range Weather Forecast ERA\u201040 reanalysis data,\nwith the surface air temperature\u2010variability associated with\ngeomagnetic disturbances being roughly twice that associ-\nated with solar cycle UV variability [Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2009].\n[6] Few ground\u2010based data sets have the combination\nof long time series and near\u2010global spatial coverage to\ndescribe the variation in precipitation into the atmosphere.\nFor example, the AARDDVARK array of subionospheric\nradio receivers [Clilverd et al., 2009] and the GLORIA\nriometer array [Alfonsi et al., 2008] are examples of relevant,\nbut currently limited, ground\u2010based instruments. There are\nalso few spacecraft measurements available that measure\nprecipitating electron fluxes and energy spectra in the\nbounce loss cone for the energy range >20 keV and which\nhave flown for sufficiently long time periods. One spacecraft\ninstrument that has provided long\u2010term global data is the\nSpace Environment Monitor (SEM\u20102) instrument package\nonboard the Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites\n(POES). In this paper we examine roughly 10 years of\nmeasurements of trapped and precipitating electrons avail-\nable from POES. This data set includes both medium and\nrelativistic energy\u2010range measurements of trapped and pre-\ncipitating electrons, from the same spacecraft. While the\ndetectors suffer from some contamination issues that com-\nplicate the understanding of the measurements, we show that\nthe POES\/SEM\u20102 observations provide additional insight\ninto the precipitation of energetic electrons from the radia-\ntion belts and may be developed into a useful climatology.\nWhile many radiation belt processes take place around the\ngeomagnetic equator and are best studied by instruments\nthat pass near this location, studies into the loss of particles\nfrom the radiation belt through atmospheric are best exam-\nined by instruments near the feet of the field lines. The low\naltitudes of the POES platforms make them well suited for\nviewing particles near or in the loss cone and hence allow a\nfocus on the timescale of processes that drive particles into\nthe atmosphere.\n2. POES Particle Instrumentation\n[7] In this study we make use of particle measurements by\nthe SEM\u20102 instrument package onboard the POES space-\ncraft, which are in Sun\u2010synchronous orbits at \u223c800\u2013850 km\naltitudes. SEM\u20102 includes the Medium Energy Proton and\nElectron Detector (MEPED) in addition to the Total Energy\nDetector (TED). Together these instruments monitor elec-\ntron fluxes from 50 eV up to 2700 keV. For a detailed\ndescription of the SEM\u20102 instruments, see Evans and Greer\n[2004]. The SEM\u20102 package is a significant upgrade on the\nSEM\u20101 package [Hill et al., 1985], which operated onboard\nthe NOAA Television and InfraRed Observation Satellite\n(TIROS) spacecraft from 1978 to 2004. We make use of\nSEM\u20102 observations from up to four POES spacecraft, from\nthe earliest date of data availability up to 20 July 2008. The\nstarting dates are 1 July 1998 for NOAA\u201015, 10 January\n2001 for NOAA\u201016, 12 July 2002 for NOAA\u201017, and\n7 June 2005 for NOAA\u201018. All POES data are available\nfrom http:\/\/poes.ngdc.noaa.gov\/data\/; whereas the full\u2010\nresolution data has 2 s time resolution, we work with the\n16 s resolution ASCII files. Table 1 lists the SEM\u20102 detectors\nused in the current study, where \u201ce\u201d refers to electron\ndetectors and \u201cP\u201d proton detectors. The 0\u00b0\u2010pointing detectors\nare mounted on the three\u2010axis stabilized POES spacecraft so\nthat the center of each detector field of view is outward\nalong the local zenith, parallel to the Earth\u2010center\u2010to\u2010satel-\nlite radial vector. Another set of telescopes, termed the 90\u00b0\ndetectors, are mounted approximately perpendicular to the\n0\u00b0 detector. In addition, there is also a set of omnidirectional\nmeasurements made from a dome detector that is mounted\nparallel to the 0\u00b0 telescopes. The telescopes pointing in the\nTable 1.

The nature of\nthe relativistic electron contamination for the P6 and P6omni detectors is\ndescribed in section 4.\nRODGER ET AL.: POES OBSERVATIONS OF EEP A04202A04202\n2 of 13\n0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 directions are \u00b115\u00b0 wide, while the omnidirec-\ntional dome detectors (labeled \u201comni\u201d) are \u00b160\u00b0 wide.\n[8] POES user information suggests that the 0\u00b0 telescopes\nmonitor particles in the atmospheric loss cone that will enter\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere below the satellite when the space-\ncraft is poleward of about 35\u00b0, while at high latitudes the\n90\u00b0 telescopes monitor particles which are trapped in the\nVan Allan radiation belts. Some confirmation of this comes\nfrom Gamble et al. [2008, Figure 5], which shows that the\n90\u00b0 electron telescopes include the drift\u2010loss cone at lati-\ntudes of 30\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 south. The POES SEM\u20102 data files in-\ncludes the IGRF\u2010determined pitch angles of the particles\ndetected by the 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 telescopes at the spacecraft.\nUsing the IGRF magnetic model for the altitude of the\nNOAA\u201015 spacecraft in mid\u20102005, we have determined\nthe angular width of the bounce and drift loss cones at the\nsatellite, and hence the geographical variation of the particle\npopulations was detected. Figure 1 presents a world map of\nthe changing radiation belt population observed by the 0\u00b0\u2010\ndirected \u00b115\u00b0\u2010wide MEPED telescopes onboard NOAA\u201015.\nThis plot is representative for all four POES spacecraft\nincluded in our study and over the entire time period. In\nFigure 1, \u201cT\u201d indicates trapped flux, \u201cDLC\u201d is drift\u2010loss\ncone, and \u201cBLC\u201d is bounce\u2010loss cone. For the highest lati-\ntudes the instrument only measures fluxes inside the bounce\u2010\nloss cone, i.e., precipitating beneath the spacecraft, while at\nlower latitudes it observes a mix of populations. This limit,\nabove which the 0\u00b0 telescope views only the BLC, corre-\nsponds approximately to L > 1.4. Note that at very high\nlatitudes, while the 0\u00b0 telescopes will only be observing\nparticles inside the BLC, they will not view the entire BLC\nand hence may not provide a fully accurate measure of\nBLC fluxes. As an example of the pitch angle range examined\nby this telescope, consider the point 34.5\u00b0E, 61.5\u00b0N (L = 3.9).\nAt this location, the center of the 0\u00b0\u2010directed MEPED tele-\nscopes are measuring electrons with pitch angles of 20.8\u00b0,\nwhile the edge of the BLC angle at the satellite is 58.4\u00b0, and\nthe edge of the DLC is 59.6\u00b0. Clearly the upper and lower\nedges of the \u00b115\u00b0\u2010wide telescopes are viewing only BLC\nfluxes at this location, as the upper (35.8\u00b0) and lower edges\n(5.8\u00b0) of the telescope\u2019s viewing range is entirely inside the\nBLC.Whenmapped to the geomagnetic equator, the center of\nthe 0\u00b0 directed MEPED telescopes measure electrons with\npitch angles of 2.3\u00b0 and are measuring over the pitch angle\nrange from the upper edge of 2.7\u00b0 to the lower edge of 0.5\u00b0,\nwhereas the edge of the BLC angle is 5.6\u00b0.\n[9] Owing to the large angular width of the omnidirec-\ntional dome detectors the \u2018omni\u2019 channels include a mix of\nthe trapped, drift\u2010loss cone and bounce\u2010loss cone popula-\ntions for essentially all locations. Sandanger et al. [2007]\nused observations from the SEM\u20101 instrument package\nonboard NOAA\u201012 and argued that at high latitudes the\ndome instrument could be used as precipitation monitor.\nOur calculations, undertaken for the SEM\u20102 package\nthrough the same process as for the 0\u00b0 telescopes outlined\nabove, show that the \u00b160\u00b0 wide dome detectors will detect\nonly trapped populations at locations that are essentially on\nthe geomagnetic equator, but elsewhere will include con-\ntributions from the T, DLC, and BLC populations up to L \u223c 15\nwhere the field lines become open and the IGRF\u2010calcula-\ntions fail to produce meaningful results. For the specific\nL = 3.9 location described above, the upper edge of the\ndome instrument would sample pitch angles of 80.8\u00b0 at the\nsatellites, which correspond to electrons with pitch angles at\nthe geomagnetic equator of 6.5\u00b0. Thus while the dome in-\nstrument includes a mix of trapped and loss\u2010cone popula-\ntions, the low altitude of the satellite (\u223c800\u2013850 km) means\nthat the trapped populations have pitch angles only slightly\nabove the outer edge of the loss cone. This will be true for a\nwide range of L shells, meaning that while the fluxes from\nthe dome detectors will not represent true loss\u2010cone fluxes,\nit may indeed provide an indication of processes driving\nparticles toward the loss cone. Note that the low altitude of\nthe POES satellites requires that when the 0\u00b0 pointing\ntelescopes measures trapped particles, these will have\nequatorial pitch angles that are only slightly above the outer\nedge of the loss cone at the geomagnetic equator.\n3. Use of \u201cMedium\u201d\u2010Energy Electron\nMeasurements\n[10] In this study the SEM\u20102 particle observations have\nbeen combined to produce mean particle counts varying\nwith L and time, using 0.25\u2010L and 3 h time resolution.\nFigure 1.

Here T indicates trapped flux, DLC is drift\u2010loss cone, and BLC\nis bounce loss cone. For the highest latitudes the instrument only measures fluxes inside the bounce\u2010loss\ncone, while at lower latitudes it observes a mix of populations.\nRODGER ET AL.: POES OBSERVATIONS OF EEP A04202A04202\n3 of 13\nFigure 2.

This plot spans the\nentire period considered from 1 July 1998 to 20 July 2008;\nblack strips early in the plot are due to a lack of spacecraft\ncoverage, as well as occasional data gaps that are present\nin 2007.\n[11] Figure 2 (top) shows observations from the e3 90\u00b0\ntelescope (trapped electrons) behaving largely as expected,\nwith the inner and outer radiation belts visible, and occa-\nsional short\u2010lived injections occurring through the slot\u2010\nregion during intense geomagnetic storms. In addition, there\nappears to be an overall outer radiation belt flux increase\nduring the declining phase of the solar cycle from late\n2002 to mid\u20102004, which is consistent with the variation of\ngeomagnetic activity indices such as Ap during the recent\n11\u2010year solar cycle.\n[12] As noted in the final column of Table 1, the SEM\u20102\ne1, e2, and e3 telescopes suffer from contamination by\nrather low\u2010energy protons, with one proton in the correct\nenergy range leading to one count in the electron detector.\nThe detector energy ranges given in Table 1 have been taken\nfrom Table 3.3.2 of Evans and Greer [2004], and were\nexperimentally determined. In Figure 2 (bottom) there is a\nstrong agreement between the variation and magnitude of\nthe counts from the e3 and P3 0\u00b0 detectors, which is sug-\ngestive of a significant contamination issue in this data set.\nThis is also indicated by the otherwise surprisingly large\nL\u2010range of >300 keV precipitation suggested by the e3 0\u00b0\ntelescope, with large values extending to L = 8, well beyond\nthe extent of the outer of the outer radiation belt as observed\nby the e3 90\u00b0 telescope (trapped electron fluxes). In order to\nquantify the level of contamination in the e1, e2, and e3\ntelescopes, and estimate where the counts from the \u201celec-\ntron\u201d telescopes are most likely to be dominated by elec-\ntrons, we require that the counts reported by the electron\ntelescope be at least twice as large as the counts from the\n\u201ccontaminating\u201d proton telescope because one \u201ccontami-\nnating\u201d proton will produce one incorrect electron count.\nUnder these conditions, we take the electron observations to\nbe \u201cgood\u201d when the following hold:\ne1 > 2\u0001 P2 \u00f01\u00de\ne2 > 2\u0001 P3 \u00f02\u00de\ne3 > 2\u0001 P3 \u00f03\u00de\n[13] Figure 3 shows the application of these conditions to\nthe e3 telescope data, which has the most contamination\nfrom the e1, e2, and e3 detector set. Figure 3 (left) shows the\ncontamination plot for the e3 90\u00b0 detector, while Figure 3\n(right) presents the e3 0\u00b0 pointing telescope. Red sections\nindicate where proton contamination is likely to be signifi-\ncant, while yellow indicates \u201cgood\u201d quality electron counts.\nBlack sections are due to solar proton events (suppressed in\nour plot) or data gaps. Clearly, the trapped electron\nobservations reported by the e3 90\u00b0 detector suffer from\nsignificantly less contamination than the e3 0\u00b0 detector.\nThis is due to lower levels of trapped protons in this\nenergy range when compared to equivalent protons in the\nBLC, as seen in the SEM\u20102 proton telescope observations.\nFor the purposes of radiation belt studies, the 90\u00b0\u2010pointing\n(trapped flux, L > 1.4) e1, e2, and e3 observations are of good\nquality, with most of the contamination occurring beyond\nL = 7, which is in the very outer part of the outer radiation\nbelt. However, the 0\u00b0\u2010pointing (BLC flux) e1, e2, and e3\nobservations have significant levels of contamination in the\n\u201cheart of the radiation belts\u201d (L = 4.5\u20135.5), with a very\nsignificant fraction of the measurements corrupted by\nproton contamination.\n[14] Table 2 indicates the percentage of suspect observa-\ntions across the L\u2010shell range four to seven, with 3 h, 0.25\u2010L\nresolution across the time range 1 December 1998 to 31\nFigure 3.

The time range is limited by the availability\nof geomagnetic auroral electrojet (AE) index from the WDC\nfor Geomagnetism (http:\/\/wdc.kugi.kyoto\u2010u.ac.jp\/). During\ndisturbed geomagnetic conditions (AE \u0003 150 nT; following\nMeredith et al. [2006]), more than 93% of the 90\u00b0\u2010telescope\nobservations are good quality, with the primary contami-\nnation coming from the e3 detector. On average, only 3.5%\nof the data from this telescope suffers from contamination.\nThe situation is considerably more serious for the 0\u00b0\u2010tele-\nscope observations necessary for describing energetic elec-\ntron precipitation. Overall contamination is present 42% of\nthe time for the e3 0\u00b0 telescope and can reach as much as\n55% during geomagnetically disturbed periods. Even in\nquiet periods nearly 30% of the >300 keV precipitation\nmeasurements are potentially contaminated.\n[15] The large levels of proton contamination present in\nthe SEM\u20102 energetic electron precipitation observations\nmay affect the quality of geomagnetically dependant pre-\ncipitation climatologies that have been developed from this\ndata set [e.g., W\u00fcest et al., 2005]. It is not clear from the\nreports published that observations dominated by proton\ncontamination have been removed before the climatology\nwas developed. The >30, >100, and >300 keV electron\ntelescopes in the earlier SEM\u20101 package onboard the NOAA\nTIROS spacecraft (1978\u20132004) also suffered from proton\ncontamination, although for differing energies (>135 keV\n[Hill et al., 1985]) due to the different instrument design.\nPrecipitation climatologies developed using these data [e.g.,\nCodrescu et al., 1997] may also contain significant proton\nprecipitation masquerading as electron events. New proces-\nsing techniques are being developed to remove the proton\ncontamination from the POES SEM\u20102 electron observations,\nrather than simply testing of contamination and excluding\nthat data as we have undertaken in a fundamentally con-\nservative approach. The reprocessed observations should\nallow new and accurate climatologies to be produced. These\ntechniques will be detailed in a future study.\n4. SEM\u20102 Observations of Relativistic Electrons\n[16] As outlined in Table 1, SEM\u20102 proton detectors also\nsuffer from contamination, falsely responding to electrons\nwith relativistic energies [Evans et al., 2008]. The P6 omni-\ndirectional dome detector, intended to measure protons with\nenergies >16 MeV, also responds to electrons with energies\n>800 keV [Sandanger et al., 2007]. The detection efficiency\nof the P6 dome has a value of \u223c0.5 for an incident electron of\nenergy \u223c1.5 MeV and reaches 1 for incident electrons with\nenergy >2 MeV. As such while the P6omni detector responds\nto electrons >800 keV, it is not strictly a >800 keV electron\ndetector due to the varying detection efficiency. While the\nrelativistic electron observations from the omnidirectional\nP6 dome detector may serve to complement those from\nother spacecraft with relativistic electrons (e.g., SAMPEX),\nit is not well suited to understanding relativistic electron\nprecipitation (REP) because it responds to a mix of trapped\u2010\nand loss\u2010cone particles. However, the P6 telescope detec-\ntors, which are designed to measure >6.9 MeV protons, also\nrespond to either trapped or BLC electrons (depending on\nL\u2010shell), with energies starting from 700 keV [Millan et\nal., 2008; R. Millan, personal communication, 2008].\nWhile the detection efficiency profile is not sharp, the two\nnear\u2010orthogonal P6 telescopes provide simultaneous in situ\nobservations of both trapped and precipitating relativistic\nelectrons \u223c700 keV, complicating the information on the\nenergy of the electrons included in the counts. Given that\nthe SEM\u20102 observations start from mid\u20101998, it may be\npossible in the future to produce an estimated precipitation\nclimatology using this data set combined with some addi-\ntional information on the energy spectra of the precipitating\nparticles.\n[17] Figure 4 shows the variation with L and time of the\nrelativistic electrons at low altitudes reported by P6 90\u00b0\ndetector. While these electrons are trapped, as they are\nobserved by the low\u2010altitude POES instruments they have\npitch angles that are relatively close to the atmospheric loss\ncone and as such represent the population of relativistic\nelectrons that are most easily available to pitch angle\nscatter into the atmosphere. The \u201cprimary\u201d data product\nfrom the P6 telescope, >6.9 MeV protons during solar\nproton events (SPE), have been removed by using solar\nproton activity indications from the P7 omnidirectional\ndetector, thus leaving only the relativistic electron counts.\nSuperimposed on Figure 4 is the daily sunspot number\n(white line), and ICME events classified by the ACE\nspacecraft (red crosses). The pattern of relativistic electron\ncounts in the P6 90\u00b0 detector resembles the variability in the\ne3 90\u00b0 detector (Figure 2, top), with a strong enhancement\nduring the declining solar phase, but with observations\nprimarily in the outer radiation belt. It is clear from Figure 4\nthat SPE do not obscure the P6 90\u00b0 relativistic electron\ncounts over significant time periods, suggesting that the\nSEM\u20102 observations may serve as a useful database of rela-\ntivistic electron observations when solar proton levels are not\nsignificant.\n[18] We have attempted to contrast the \u201csize\u201d of the\nenhancements described above, and particularly the P6\u2010\ndetected relativistic electrons, which will penetrate most\ndeeply into the atmosphere. The behavior of the T and BLC\nfluxes shows several characteristic features across the\n\u223c10 years of SEM\u20102 relativistic electron observations. In\ngeneral, there is a strong agreement in the variability of the\ntrapped and BLC relativistic electrons. While it appears that\nthe sensitivity of the P6 0\u00b0 detector (BLC electrons) is low,\nsuch that only rather enhanced relativistic electron precipi-\ntation periods appear in the record, there is strong agreement\nbetween the near\u2010perpendicular telescopes (not shown). A\nnumber of relativistic electron enhancements occur in both\nthe T and BLC fluxes that repeat in a periodic (\u223c27 day)\nTable 2.

Oc-\ncasionally, enhancements in the relativistic electron popu-\nlations occur that extend inward in L to L = 2\u20132.5. These\nlarge and deep enhancements are rare, even over the ap-\nproximately 10\u2010year data set, and tend to involve a combi-\nnation of high solar\u2010wind speeds, a large geomagnetic storm,\nand the arrival of an ICME. As these factors tend to occur\ntogether, it is very difficult to determine if any one factor is\ndominant, although it is clear that most ACE\u2010reported tran-\nsient ICMEs do not always produce such deep enhancements.\n[19] Because it was not designed to measure relativistic\nelectrons, the P6 0\u00b0 detector often reports fluxes near the\nnoise floor of the instrument, and only reports substantial\nrelativistic electron precipitation fluxes during somewhat\nmore intense events. This is less of an issue with the P6 90\u00b0\ndetector, which is measuring trapped relativistic electron\nfluxes, at least outside of SPE times. It may be possible to\nenhance the dynamic range of the SEM\u20102 precipitating\nrelativistic electron observations by noting that during per-\niods when the P6 0\u00b0 detector is responding to REP there is a\nnear\u2010constant ratio between the P6 90\u00b0 and P6 0\u00b0 detectors,\nas shown in Figure 5 for 2006. The same ratio is seen in the\nother years (mid\u20101998 onward). As before, SPE periods have\nbeen removed from the data, leading to black strips. The ACE\nreported solar wind speed (white line), ACE determined\u2010\nICME events (red crosses), and Dst variation (yellow line)\nhave been added for context. When the P6 0\u00b0 detector re-\nports REP, the trapped flux in the P6 90\u00b0 detector is about\n50\u201370 times higher. Figure 5 (bottom) shows the variation\nof the one\u2010day average of this ratio for L = 5. Once the\nresponse of the P6 instrument to relativistic electrons has\nbeen fully explored (following the work reported by Millan\net al. [2008]) it should be possible to use the P6 90\u00b0 ob-\nservations as a proxy for REP. We note that the physics\nbehind this relationship is in itself interesting because it\nsuggests a strong coupling (on average) between the trapped\nand precipitating fluxes, at least on 3 h timescales and at the\nlow\u2010Earth orbit altitudes in which the POES spacecraft are\nlocated. This deserves further investigation. We suggest that\nFigure 5 indicates periods where ground\u2010based data might\nbe examined for precipitation events.\n5. Relativistic Electron Enhancements at Low\nAltitudes and Near the Geomagnetic Equator\n[20] Following on from section 4, we have undertaken a\nmore detailed examination of SEM\u20102 observations during\nthe periodic enhancements in trapped\u2010electron fluxes, which\nare likely driven by high\u2010speed solar wind\u2010streams, and\ncontrasted these with GOES measurements made near the\ngeomagnetic equator. We particularly focus on the periodic\nenhancements because these are well suited to check for\nenergy\u2010dependent time delays. Such periods have been\nidentified using ACE\u2010reported solar\u2010wind speed, as listed in\nTable 3. Figure 6 (top left) shows the time variation in the\nmean electron counts inside a statistically determined plas-\nmapause model [Moldwin et al., 2002] from the e3 90\u00b0 and\nP6 90\u00b0 telescopes over the period 1 July to 31 December\n2007. In this case, we limit ourselves to counts from L = 2.5\nto the plasmapause. Observations from the detectors, at times\nwhich are likely to be affected by proton contamination, have\nbeen suppressed from the plot, using the criteria outlined in\nsection 3. The plot shows one\u2010day average values, which\nhave each been normalized to the maximum daily mean\u2010\ncount rate observed during this period so that they appear\nclearly on this plot. From mid\u2010August 2007 there are a series\nof periodic geomagnetic disturbances, as shown by the vari-\nation in Kp (black line), which has been normalized in the\nsame manner as the electron counts. The periodic geo-\nmagnetic disturbances are most likely driven by the periodic\nFigure 4. Variation with L and time of the relativistic electrons reported by the P6 90\u00b0 detector, which\nresponds to energetic electrons as a contamination product. Solar proton events have been removed to\nshow the relativistic electron response. The white line is the daily sunspot number, while the red crosses\nmark ACE\u2010reported ICME events.\nRODGER ET AL.: POES OBSERVATIONS OF EEP A04202A04202\n7 of 13\nchanges in solar\u2010wind speed (red dash\u2010dotted line). Figure 6\n(lower left) has had an energy\u2010dependant time delay applied\nto the counts reported by each detector, as described in the\nlegend. This causes the electron enhancements to line up with\nthe geomagnetic disturbance variability quite cleanly, sug-\ngesting that the enhancement mechanism progressively raises\nthe energy of electrons through the three \u201cmedium\u201d electron\ndetectors upward toward the relativistic electron observa-\ntions. We have examined the time shifts appropriate for the\ne1, e2, and e3 90\u00b0 telescopes, the P6 90\u00b0 telescope, and the P6\nomnidirectional dome detector over this period. These data\nare displayed in Table 3. While the >30 keV electron\nenhancement occurs about one day after the geomagnetic\ndriver (much like the timescales already reported at the\ngeomagnetic equator), the relativistic electron enhancement\nmeasured by the omnidirectional P6 dome detector is delayed\n\u223c12 days from the driver.\n[21] Figure 6 (top right) shows the nonshifted and time\u2010\ndelayed (bottom right) variation in the mean electron counts\noutside a statistically determined plasmapause; in this case\nFigure 5. The ratio between the relativistic electron counts (electrons above 700 keV) reported by the P6\n90\u00b0 and P6 0\u00b0 detectors during 2006.

The range of the inner\n(L = 2.5) and outer (L = 7) limits come from the observations\ndiscussed in section 4. While the variability in the POES\u2010\nobserved electron counts is different outside the plasmapause\nthan inside, in this case the same set of energy\u2010dependent\ndelays (Table 3) does an equally adequate job of linking the\nenhancements to the geomagnetic driver. The fact that the line\nstructure in the P6 90\u00b0 telescope is quite different inside the\nplasmapause compared with outside the plasmapause sug-\ngests significant differences in the processes of acceleration,\ntransport, and loss either side of the plasmapause in response\nto this HSSWS driver.\n[22] Many of the acceleration processes that produce\nenhancements in the trapped energetic electron fluxes work\npreferentially on electrons with low pitch angles (e.g., <30\u00b0\n[Horne et al., 2005]); thus, one might expect a time delay\nbefore a significant population of relativistic electrons arrives\nat the altitudes of low\u2010Earth orbiting satellites or begin pre-\ncipitating into the atmosphere. However, this is not borne out\nby a comparison of the time delays seen in the low\u2010altitude\nPOES observations with electron flux measurements from\ninstruments onboard GOES\u201012 located near the geomagnetic\nequator. Figure 7 shows the daily average fluxes of GOES\u2010\nobserved electrons with energies >0.6 MeV (magenta line)\nand >2 MeV (cyan line), plotted with the beyond\u2010the\u2010\nplasmapause POES\u2010observations from Figure 6. In Figure 7\n(top) the same format is used to present observations with no\ntime delay. Figure 7 (bottom) includes an energy\u2010dependent\ntime delay. Generally, the time variation of the >600 keV\nelectron fluxes at geostationary altitudes, and thus near the\ngeomagnetic equator, is very similar to those of the >300 keV\nelectron fluxes at low altitudes, and thus near the atmospheric\nloss cone. The same is true of the GOES >2 MeV electron\nfluxes and the POES P6 90\u00b0 telescopes. Note that the two\nGOES energy channels do not cleanly track one another,\nwhich is consistent with the behavior shown by the POES\nmeasurements. Figure 7 (bottom) shows the GOES and\nPOES observations subject to time offsets. As with the POES\ndata, the GOES measurements show an energy\u2010dependent\ntime offset between geomagnetic activity and radiation belt\nelectron fluxes. The delays are seen to be similar at the L =\n6.6 geomagnetic equator when compared with fluxes\nmeasured just above the atmosphere.\nFigure 6.

The contrasting GOES time delays\nfor the same time periods are described in Table 4. In all\ncases there is a similar time delay between the geomagnetic\ndriver and the POES >\u2212300 keV and GOES >600 keV\nmeasurements, and the geomagnetic driver and the POES P6\n90\u00b0 telescope and GOES >2 MeV measurements. While the\nlate 2007 period shows the most extreme and clear example\nof time\u2010delayed relativistic electron enhancements both in-\nside and outside the plasmapause, on average there is a six\u2010\nday interval between the occurrence of the >30 keV electron\nenhancement and the P6omni relativistic electron enhance-\nment (Table 3). In some cases we find that the energy\u2010\ndependent offsets are slightly different for inside and outside\nthe plasmapause, suggesting that the large variations in cold\nplasma density, which produce quite large differences in\nwave activity may influence the pitch\u2010angle diffusion of the\nenhancements from near to the geomagnetic equator toward\nthe atmosphere. The time delay is often slightly smaller\noutside the plasmapause than inside, but this effect is some-\nwhat subtle. This may be due to the significant uncertainties\n(with standard deviations up to \u00b11 L\u2010shell) reported from the\nplasmasphere model [Moldwin et al., 2002].\n[24] All the analysis outlined above was initially under-\ntaken \u201cby eye\u201d looking for the best fit between the plotted\ngeomagnetic variation and electron flux observations.\nHowever, we have also confirmed the scale sizes of the\nenergy\u2010dependent time delays given in Tables 3 and 4 using\ncross\u2010correlation analysis. The cross\u2010correlation analysis\nsometimes becomes unreliable in the case of occasional\ngaps in the data sequences. In addition, at the highest energy\nchannels the delays present can be long enough relative to\nthe fundamental recurrent activity period to confuse the\nanalysis technique, giving negative correlation delays for the\nhighest energy channels. We therefore provide the time\ndelays in Tables 3 and 4, noting that they are reasonably\nconsistent both with a formal cross correlation to determine\nthe time lags and with \u201cby eye\u201d analysis.\n[25] Shprits et al. [2009] and Shprits [2009] examined the\nprocesses required to transfer the relatively rapid accelera-\ntion that initially takes place near the geomagnetic equator\nand might be produced by chorus waves [Horne et al.,\n2005] into precipitating electrons. These studies found\nthat other wave processes (e.g., magnetosonic waves and\nEMIC waves) are required to pitch\u2010angle scatter the near\u2010\nequatorial enhancements toward the atmosphere loss cone.\nThe GOES and POES measurements indicate that these\nscattering processes are comparatively rapid, such that the\nenhancements spread along the entire field line (i.e., spread\nin pitch\u2010angle space) on a similar time scale as the accel-\neration process itself, so that there is a similar time variation\nin the electron fluxes at the geomagnetic equator and near\nthe atmospheric loss cone. The presence of time delays is\nconsistent with a \u201ccartoon\u201d view of electron acceleration\nprocesses, for example through cyclotron interactions with\nVLF waves [Horne et al., 2005] such that electrons are\naccelerated to progressively higher energies over time.\n[26] The link between the geostationary and low\u2010altitude\nelectron flux variation emphasizes the importance of mul-\ntiple wave processes necessary to accelerate and pitch\u2010angle\nscatter energetic electrons, coupling changes in solar output\nto the atmosphere. During typical \u201cambient\u201d conditions,\ndifferent wave activities are concentrated into different\nmagnetic local time (MLT) regions [Summers et al., 1998;\nShprits et al., 2008], and acceleration from processes such\nas chorus would be concentrated into one MLT region,\nwhereas the wave activity driving the electron enhancements\nacross a wide range of pitch angles will occur in different\nMLT regions. However, the energetic electrons in question\ndrift rapidly around the Earth, and thus can be expected to\nsample all wave types in a short time period. In addition,\nduring periods of enhanced geomagnetic activities the\n\u201cnormal\u201d picture of wave activity with MLT can change, as\nhas been reported for equatorial chorus waves that spread\nfrom the morning sector into the nightside [Meredith et al.,\n2003].\n[27] While the POES spacecraft are in Sun\u2010synchronous\norbits that sample small ranges of MLT, the inclusion of\nobservations from multiple satellites allows a consideration\nof MLT dependence. From 2003 onward, there were three\nNOAA POES spacecraft operating with SEM\u20102 instrument\npackages, and four from mid\u20102005 onward. However, the\ntime delays and enhancements seen in the 90\u00b0 telescopes\nconsidered here do not show significant MLT dependence.\nWe have also undertaken tests using a fixed L\u2010shell range,\nrather than making use of the statistical plasmapause model,\nparticularly focused upon the range of L = 4.5\u20135.5, the\n\u201cheart of the radiation belts.\u201d These tests indicated the time\ndelays were still clearly present, such that atmospheric\nprecipitation into this L\u2010shell range are likely to experience\nthese time delays in the energy components.\n[28] These results are consistent with other studies that\nhave examined relativistic electrons at geostationary orbits.\nFor example, Reeves et al. [2003] used observations from\nthe Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) space envi-\nronment monitors to examine the response of outer belt\nrelativistic electrons (1.8\u20133.5 MeV) at geostationary orbits\nto 276 geomagnetic storms. They defined the defined the\n\u201cpost\u2010storm flux\u201d as the maximum flux in the one to five\ndays after the storm. As the average time delay that we\nobserved in the GOES >2 MeV measurements is four days,\nthese two windows will generally overlap. The LANL space\nenvironment monitors have nine energy channels spanning\n50 keV\u20131.5 MeV and an integral detector that responds to\nrelativistic electrons with energies >1.5 MeV. The analysis\npresented in this paper could usefully be applied to the\nLANL data sets to better examine the energy dependence of\nthe time offsets at geostationary altitudes (nominally L \u2248 6.6).\nTable 4.

[2008] shows a\nsuperposed epoch analysis of LANL flux data sets for both\nICME and periodic HSSWS, and appears to show energy\u2010\ndependent offsets in the case of HSSWS\u2010driven storms. We\nacknowledge that this data set is likely to provide a very\nuseful source for such a study, although currently significant\ntime periods are not available for public dissemination\n(R. Friedel, personal communication, 2009).\n[29] The energy\u2010dependent time delays will make it more\ndifficult to produce a representative precipitation climatol-\nogy, particularly for electron energies >100 keV. For ex-\nample, the Codrescu et al. [1997] electron precipitation\nclimatology uses the TIROS\/SEM\u20101 observations to extend\nearlier climatologies beyond 30 keV, organized through a\ngeomagnetic \u201cactivity index,\u201d which is essentially binned\nKp [Fuller\u2010Rowell and Evans, 1987]. However, this will\nmix low\u2010medium Kp periods before storms, when precipi-\ntating fluxes will be low, with low\u2010medium Kp periods after\nstorm\u2010triggered injections, where precipitating fluxes of\n>100 keV electrons can be high due to delayed acceleration.\n6. Summary and Conclusions\n[30] Coupling between the Van Allen radiation belts and\nthe Earth\u2019s ionosphere through precipitating particles is an\narea of increased scientific interest due to a growing focus\non the physics of the radiation belts and also the response of\nthe atmosphere to precipitating particles. Outstanding issues\nsurround our understanding of the precipitation of \u201cmedium\u201d\n(>20 keV) and highly energetic (relativistic) electrons, which\nare needed for comparison with other experimental data sets,\nand also to drive theoretical models. In this paper we examine\nroughly 10 years of measurements of trapped and precipi-\ntating electrons available from the SEM\u20102 instrument pack-\nage onboard the POES. This data set includes both medium\nand relativistic energy\u2010range measurements of trapped and\nprecipitating electrons from the same spacecraft.\n[31] Here we have shown that the POES SEM\u20102 detectors\nsuffer from some contamination issues that complicate the\nunderstanding of the measurements, but that the observations\nprovide additional insight into the precipitation of energetic\nelectrons from the radiation belts andmay be developed into a\nuseful climatology. In particular, the 0\u00b0\u2010directed MEPED\u2010\ntelescopes view only the locally precipitating fluxes in the\nBLC from geomagnetic latitudes corresponding approxi-\nmately to L > 1.4.\n[32] As has been known for some time, the \u201cmedium\u201d\nelectron energy channels in the SEM\u20102 instrument can\nsuffer from contamination by rather low\u2010energy protons.\nThe 90\u00b0\u2010pointing (trapped flux) >30, >100, and >300 keV\nelectron observations are not badly affected, with most of\nthe contamination occurring beyond L = 7, which is in the\nvery outer part of the outer radiation belt. As such, these\nobservations are well suited for the purposes of radiation\nbelt studies. However, the 0\u00b0\u2010pointing (BLC) electrons from\nthese energies have significant levels of contamination in\nthe \u201cheart of the radiation belts\u201d (L = 4.5 to 5.5) with a\nsignificant fraction of the measurements dominated by\nproton contamination. Contamination can reach 55% during\ngeomagnetically disturbed periods. Even in quiet periods\nnearly 30% of the >300 keV precipitation measurements are\npotentially contaminated. The large levels of proton con-\ntamination present in the SEM\u20102 energetic electron precipi-\ntation observations may affect the quality of geomagnetically\ndependant precipitation climatologies that have been devel-\noped from this data set. It is likely that similar issues apply to\nthe precipitation climatologies developed from the early\nSEM\u20101.\n[33] The SEM\u20102 proton detectors also suffer from con-\ntamination, responding to electrons at relativistic energies\n[Evans et al., 2008]. The P6 telescope detectors, which are\ndesigned to measure >6.9 MeV protons, also respond to\nelectrons with energies from 700 keV upward [Millan et al.,\n2008], providing simultaneous in situ observations of both\ntrapped and precipitating relativistic electrons from mid\u2010\n1998. In contrast, the P6 0\u00b0 detector only reports relativistic\nelectrons during somewhat more intense events. However,\ntaking this into account there is very strong agreement be-\ntween the behavior of the trapped and precipitating relativ-\nistic electrons, at least on 3 h timescales. Relativistic\nelectron increases are associated with both ICME and pe-\nriodic HSSWS. It is clear from our investigation that solar\nproton events do not obscure the trapped relativistic electron\ncounts over significant time periods, and that the POES\/\nSEM\u20102 observations may serve as a useful database of new\nrelativistic electron observations and particularly, identify-\ning periods of strong REP.\n[34] Finally, there is an energy\u2010dependent time delay\nobserved in the POES\/SEM\u20102 observations, with an almost\none\u2010week delay between the >30 keV electron enhancement\nand the P6omni relativistic electron enhancement. One pos-\nsible interpretation of this is a two\u2010stage process, where\nrelatively rapid acceleration initially takes place near the\ngeomagnetic equator as predicted by theory and observed\nexperimentally. This is followed by a much slower process,\nwhere the relativistic electrons scatter toward the atmo-\nsphere loss cone at a rate that is energy dependent. Such\nlarge delays should have consequences for the timing of the\natmospheric impact of HSSWS\u2010triggered geomagnetic\nstorms. While there appears to be some cold\u2010plasma density\ndependence in the energy\u2010dependent delay, this effect is not\nparticularly strong, which may reflect the significant un-\ncertainties associated with the statistical plasmasphere\nmodel we employ. In contrast, there are clearly significant\ndifferences in the variability of POES\u2010observed electron\ncounts inside the plasmapause when compared with outside\nthe plasmapause, suggesting significant differences in the\nprocesses of acceleration, transport, and loss either side of\nthe plasmapause in response to this HSSWS\u2010driver.\n[35] Acknowledgments.
