L. SIMONS\u2020 AND S. A. GOURLEY\u2020\nAbstract. We propose stage-structured population models for species whose adult members\nare subject to culling, with a view to understanding the culling regimes that are likely to result in\neradication of the species. A purely time-dependent model is proposed in which culling occurs at\nparticular discrete times, not necessarily equally spaced. Then a reaction-di\ufb00usion model is proposed\nfor a situation in which the adults can di\ufb00use; in this model the culling is continuous in time but\noccurs only at particular discrete points in space. Such a model might be appropriate for pheromone\ntrapping of insects. For both models conditions are obtained that are su\ufb03cient for species eradication.\nKey words. stage-structure, delay, impulse, pest control\nAMS subject classi\ufb01cations. 34K45, 34K20, 35K57, 92D25\nDOI. 10.1137\/050637777\n1. Introduction. Many species are subject to some form of culling. Often this\nis for reasons of pest control, and the aim of culling in this case might well be the\nlocalized eradication of the pest. In other situations the reason for culling is simply\nto keep numbers under control for the protection of habitats or other species, and\ncomplete eradication is not the aim.\nUnlike natural mortality which one might reasonably suppose to occur continu-\nously, the mortality attributable to culling is often more likely to take place only at\ncertain times. Sometimes these times may be prescribed by law, as in the case of\ngame bird and wildfowl shooting in the UK, which takes place in prescribed seasons\nlasting only a few months. Also, where animals such as deer (which as adults have\nno natural predators in the UK or Ireland) are culled for habitat protection, culling\noften occurs only at certain times of the year. In the UK, badgers, which are believed\nto spread tuberculosis to cattle, are subjected to culling by trapping and shooting,\nbut again there are restrictions on the timing of the culls in an attempt to reduce\nthe problem of badger cubs being orphaned and starving to death. Crop spraying as\na way to control insect pests is also a method of control likely to be happening at\ncertain discrete times (sometimes chosen to coincide with critical stages in the insects\u2019\ndevelopment).\nOne might also envisage situations where some form of culling takes place con-\ntinuously in time but only at discrete points in space. A good example would be the\ntrapping system used in Australia to control the blow\ufb02y Lucilia cuprina which is a\nsubstantial nuisance to sheep farmers. Female \ufb02ies lay their eggs in a sheep\u2019s \ufb02eece.\nThe eggs hatch into larvae which feed on the sheep\u2019s damaged skin, creating a wound\nthat can attract other \ufb02ies. The larval and pupal stages may total around 14 days\n[6]. One approach to controlling the \ufb02y populations is by using pesticides, but this\nraises concerns regarding pesticide residue on the wool as well as environmental and\noccupational health and safety. An alternative is to trap the blow\ufb02ies using specially\n\u2217Received by the editors August 8, 2005; accepted for publication (in revised form) May 24, 2006;\npublished electronically August 22, 2006.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/siap\/66-6\/63777.html\n\u2020Department of Mathematics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, United Kingdom\n(s.gourley@surrey.ac.uk).\n1853\n1854 R.

Entrance cones allow blow\ufb02ies to enter but not leave the buckets, which con-\ntain a chemical attractant which smells like the blow\ufb02ies\u2019 food sources\u2014rotting \ufb02eece,\ncarcasses, urine, and feces. Manufacturers of the buckets o\ufb00er advice regarding where\nthey should be placed. The second model of the present paper, which we study in\nsection 3, proposes a possible model for such trapping of blow\ufb02ies continuously in\ntime but only at discrete points in a one-dimensional space. The traps in our model\ndo not have to be equally spaced apart, and neither do they all have to be equally\ne\ufb00ective.\nThe use of impulsive di\ufb00erential equations as models of pest control seems to be a\nrelatively undeveloped application area. Liu, Zhang, and Chen [8], motivated by the\ntopic of pest control, proposed and studied a Lotka\u2013Volterra predator prey model with\nimpulsive e\ufb00ects (but no delay). Their model exhibits complex dynamics including\nquasi periodicity and chaos. Models of vaccination are another obvious application\narea (Hui and Chen [7]). However, impulsive di\ufb00erential equations, as a topic in their\nown right, have received some attention. See, for example, Wu [10] or the book by\nGopalsamy [4]. A number of papers give conditions for existence of periodic solutions\nand oscillation properties more generally, but this is not our interest in the present\npaper.\nSection 2 of this paper analyzes a purely time-dependent model for culling that\noccurs only at particular discrete times, while section 3 analyzes a reaction-di\ufb00usion\nmodel incorporating culling that is continuous in time but discrete in space.\n2. Culling at discrete times. In this section we propose a model for a stage\nstructured population with two stages: immature and mature, in which births and\nnaturally occurring deaths occur continuously but culling or trapping occurs only at\ncertain particular times, namely at times tj with 0 < t1 < t2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < tj < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 and\ntj \u2192 \u221e as j \u2192 \u221e. At the cull which occurs at time tj a proportion bj of the adult\npopulation is culled, causing a sharp decrease in the population and consequently a\ndiscontinuity in the evolution at time tj .\nLet u(t, a) be the density of individuals at time t of age a, and assume that an\nindividual becomes mature on reaching the age \u03c4 . We will assume that the total\nnumber of mature adults um(t), de\ufb01ned by\num(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u03c4\nu(t, a) da,\nobeys an evolution equation of the form\nu\u2032m(t) = u(t, \u03c4)\u2212 d(um(t))\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\nbjum(t\n\u2212\nj )\u03b4(t\u2212 tj),(2.1)\nwhere u(t, \u03c4) is the number of individuals of age exactly \u03c4 and therefore represents\nadult recruitment, \u2212d(um(t)) is naturally occurring deaths, and the last term is the\nculling term. It will be assumed that the immatures are governed by the standard\nMcKendrick\u2013von Foerster model for an age-structured population, namely\n\u2202u\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202u\n\u2202a\n= \u2212\u03bcu, t > 0, 0 < a < \u03c4,(2.2)\nwith \u03bc > 0 constant, the initial condition\nu(0, a) = u0(a) \u2265 0, a \u2265 0,(2.3)\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL WITH IMPULSES 1855\nand also the assumption that the birth rate u(t, 0) is a function of the total number\nof adults so that\nu(t, 0) = b(um(t)).(2.4)\nFor the present section the mathematical assumptions on the death function d(um)\nand the birth function b(um) are listed in (2.7) below. As our results are for the\nlinearized model it is the properties of these functions at low densities that matter\nin this paper. Two typical birth functions used in much of the literature seem to\nbe b(um) = Pume\n\u2212Aum and b(um) = Pu2me\n\u2212Aum , both of which decrease at large\ndensities due to crowding e\ufb00ects. Note that the second of these has b\u2032(0) = 0, which\nis motivated by the fact that in some populations the per capita growth rate at low\ndensities is very small due to lack of group defense and low mating probability. This\nfunction does not satisfy (2.7) below.\nThe solution of (2.2) subject to (2.3) and (2.4) is\nu(t, a) =\n{\nu0(a\u2212 t) exp(\u2212\u03bct), t < a,\nb(um(t\u2212 a)) exp(\u2212\u03bca), t > a.(2.5)\nFrom this expression we see that if t > \u03c4 , then\nu(t, \u03c4) = exp(\u2212\u03bc\u03c4)b(um(t\u2212 \u03c4)),\nwhereas if t < \u03c4 , then u(t, \u03c4) = u0(\u03c4 \u2212 t) exp(\u2212\u03bct). Insertion of these expressions\nfor u(t, \u03c4) into (2.1) yields one nonautonomous evolution equation valid for times\nt \u2208 (0, \u03c4) and another autonomous delay equation valid for all times larger than \u03c4 .\nIt is common practice in the literature on these types of models to consider only the\nlatter equation, but to consider it for all times t > 0 with prescribed initial data on\n[\u2212\u03c4, 0]. This is what we shall do in the present paper (model (2.6) below). This\npractice does raise certain issues related to initial data, an issue which is discussed in\ndetail in Bocharov and Hadeler [2]. Strictly speaking, the initial data is prescribed at\ntime t = 0 only and is just the function u0(a). One should proceed by \ufb01rst solving (2.1)\nwith u(t, \u03c4) = u0(\u03c4 \u2212 t) exp(\u2212\u03bct) for t in the interval (0, \u03c4), and then by solving the\ndelay equation in (2.6) for times t > \u03c4 . One can understand from this procedure that\nonly certain initial data for problem (2.6) is actually related to the original problem.\nHowever, since this paper is concerned mainly with the linearized equations, we do\nnot feel this will be too much of a concern.\nOur model thus takes the form\nu\u2032m(t) = e\n\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b(um(t\u2212 \u03c4))\u2212 d(um(t))\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\nbjum(t\n\u2212\nj )\u03b4(t\u2212 tj), t > 0,\num(t) = \u03c6(t) \u2265 0 for t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0); um(0) = u0m > 0,(2.6)\nwhere \u03bc > 0 represents juvenile mortality, um(t) is the total number of adults at time\nt, um(t\n\u2212\nj ) is the population just before the impulsive cull at time tj , \u03c4 is the maturation\ntime, bj is the proportion of the mature species trapped or culled at time tj , and \u03b4\ndenotes the Dirac delta function. In this model b(um(t)) is a function representing\nthe birth rate of the species, and d(um(t)) is the natural death rate of the mature\nspecies. The e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b(um(t\u2212\u03c4)) term is the rate at which immature individuals become\nmature, known as the maturation rate. This term incorporates the delay \u03c4 and is\nessentially the birth rate \u03c4 time units ago, corrected to allow for juvenile mortality.\n1856 R. R. L. SIMONS AND S. A. GOURLEY\nModels having the form of (2.6) without impulsive e\ufb00ects have been considered in\ndetail by Cooke, van den Driessche, and Zou [3].\nIn the present section we will assume the following:\n0 < t1 < t2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < tj \u2192\u221e as j \u2192\u221e,\nbj \u2208 [0, 1] \u2200j = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\nb(0) = 0, b\u2032(0) > 0, b(um) > 0 \u2200um > 0,\nd(0) = 0, d \u2208 C1[0,\u221e), d(um) > 0 \u2200um > 0.\n(2.7)\nNote that if we integrate the delay equation in (2.6) from t\u2212j to t\n+\nj , we obtain\num(t\n+\nj ) = um(t\n\u2212\nj )\u2212 bjum(t\u2212j ).\nAs a consequence, model (2.6) can be reformulated as\nu\u2032m(t) = e\n\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b(um(t\u2212 \u03c4))\u2212 d(um(t)), t \u0007= tj ,\num(t\n+\nj ) = (1\u2212 bj)um(t\u2212j ),(2.8)\num(t) = \u03c6(t) \u2265 0 for t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0); um(0) = u0m > 0.\nThe two formulations (2.6) and (2.8) of the model are both useful. For most of the\nanalysis in this section we shall be concerned only with linearized versions of these\nmodels near the zero solution. The Laplace transform provides a powerful tool for\nthe investigation of these linearized models, but one has to take careful note of the\nfact that the solution um(t) of either (2.6) or the alternative formulation (2.8) will, in\ngeneral, be discontinuous at the times tj . The well-known formula\nL{u\u2032(t)} = sU \u2212 u(0)(2.9)\nfor the Laplace transform of the derivative of a function assumes the function u(t)\nto be continuous for all t > 0. Here, U is the Laplace transform of u, and s is the\ntransform variable. For a function u(t) which is continuous except for discontinuous\njumps at the times t = tj , the corresponding formula is\nL{u\u2032(t)} = sU \u2212 u(0) +\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\ne\u2212stj\n(\nu(t\u2212j )\u2212 u(t+j )\n)\n.(2.10)\nDue care needs to be taken on this issue; otherwise there is a possibility of the dis-\ncontinuities being taken care of twice over, and if this happens incorrect results are\nproduced by the analysis. Even though the solution of (2.6) will not be continuous, in\nthe treatment of the linearized equation the Laplace transform of the derivative term\nneeds to be calculated using the formula (2.9) which assumes continuity. The dis-\ncontinuities in the solution are correctly furnished by the Laplace transform analysis\nbecause of the presence of the Dirac delta function in (2.6). The alternative approach\nwould be to carry out a Laplace transform analysis of the linearization of (2.8). In\nthis case the derivative term has to be dealt with using (2.10). It can be shown\nthat the two approaches yield the same equation for the transformed state variable\nand are therefore equivalent. It must be stressed, however, that one has to stick to\none approach or the other. The use of (2.10) in a Laplace transform analysis of the\nlinearized version of (2.6) produces incorrect results.\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL WITH IMPULSES 1857\n2.1. Positivity. Next, we shall show that solutions of (2.6) or (2.8) enjoy a\npositivity preserving property.\nProposition 2.1. Assume (2.7) holds; then the solution um(t) of (2.6), or the\nalternative formulation (2.8), satis\ufb01es um(t) \u2265 0 for all t > 0.\nProof. The proof is by the method of steps and starts by establishing positivity\nfor t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ]. First note that positivity (in fact, strict positivity) holds if all the bj\nare zero. In this case,\nu\u2032m(t) \u2265 \u2212d(um(t)) when t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ].\nBy comparison, um(t) \u2265 u\u02c6m(t) where u\u02c6m(t) is the solution of\nu\u02c6\u2032m(t) = \u2212d(u\u02c6m(t)), t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ],\nsatisfying u\u02c6m(0) = u\n0\nm > 0. From the assumptions on the function d contained\nwithin (2.7), it follows by Taylor\u2019s theorem that d(u\u02c6m(t)) = u\u02c6m(t)d\n\u2032(\u03b8(t)) for some\nfunction \u03b8(t). Therefore the above di\ufb00erential equation for u\u02c6m(t) has zero as one of\nits solutions and is also of such a form that, given initial data, we are assured of a\nunique solution. With u\u02c6m(0) > 0 it follows that u\u02c6m(t) > 0 for all t > 0; otherwise\nuniqueness is violated. Therefore um(t) > 0 for all t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ] in the case when the bj\nare all zero. From the method of steps it is clear that if the bj are zero, then strict\npositivity of um(t) holds for all t > 0.\nThe case when some or all of the bj are nonzero does not represent a signi\ufb01cant\ncomplication. They are all in [0, 1], by (2.7), and so by (2.8) the solution is always\nreset from a nonnegative value to a nonnegative value at one of the times tj (note,\nhowever that if one or more of the bj is 1, then the solution is reset to zero at the\ncorresponding time tj , so strict positivity of solutions cannot be anticipated in this\ncase). From what we have already shown the solution is certainly strictly positive\nbefore the \ufb01rst impulse time t1, and at time t1 is reset to some nonnegative value. An\nargument much like that described in the previous paragraph, but with initial time\nt1 rather than 0, then assures us of the nonnegativity of um(t) until the next time t2\nat which a resetting occurs, but then the argument just described applies again until\nthe next time t3 and so on. The proof of Proposition 2.1 is complete.\n2.2. Criteria for extinction. Linearizing (2.6) about the steady state um = 0,\nwe get\nu\u2032m(t) = e\n\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)um(t\u2212 \u03c4)\u2212 d\u2032(0)um(t)\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\nbjum(t\n\u2212\nj )\u03b4(t\u2212 tj).(2.11)\nIntegrating from t\u2212j to t\n+\nj yields the following alternative formulation for the linearized\nequation:\nu\u2032m(t) = e\n\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)um(t\u2212 \u03c4)\u2212 d\u2032(0)um(t), t \u0007= tj ,\num(t\n+\nj ) = (1\u2212 bj)um(t\u2212j ).\n(2.12)\nRemark 1. Positivity preservation, Proposition 2.1, also holds for the linearized\nproblem (2.12).\n1858 R. R. L. SIMONS AND S. A. GOURLEY\n2.2.1. The case when e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4b\u2032(0) < d\u2032(0). In this subsection we will prove\nlinear stability of the zero solution of (2.8) under the condition e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) < d\u2032(0). The\necological interpretation of this condition is that, at low densities, adult recruitment\nis insu\ufb03cient to outweigh naturally occurring deaths. Our result con\ufb01rms that, as we\nwould anticipate, under these circumstances the population will still become extinct\nwhen impulsive trapping or culling is introduced whatever the intensity and however\nfrequent or infrequent the culling occurs.\nTheorem 2.2. Let (2.7) hold and assume additionally that\ne\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) < d\u2032(0).(2.13)\nThen the solution um(t) of the linearized problem (2.12) satis\ufb01es um(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192\n\u221e.\nProof. Applying the Laplace transform\nL{u(t)} =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nu(t)e\u2212st dt\nto (2.12), using formula (2.10) to take care of the anticipated discontinuities in the\nsolution as explained earlier, and also noting that the Laplace transform of the delay\nterm can be written as\nL{e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)um(t\u2212 \u03c4)} = e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\n(\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\num(\u03b7)e\n\u2212s(\u03b7+\u03c4)d\u03b7 + e\u2212s\u03c4U\n)\n,\nwhere U = U(s) is the Laplace transform of um(t), (2.12) gives\n[s\u2212 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)e\u2212s\u03c4 + d\u2032(0)]U = um(0)\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\ne\u2212stj (um(t\u2212j )\u2212 um(t+j ))\n+ e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\num(\u03b7)e\n\u2212s(\u03b7+\u03c4) d\u03b7.\nUsing the impulse condition from (2.12) to replace um(t\n+\nj ), we get\n[s\u2212 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)e\u2212s\u03c4 + d\u2032(0)]U = um(0) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\num(\u03b7)e\n\u2212s(\u03b7+\u03c4)d\u03b7\n\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nj=1\ne\u2212stj bjum(t\u2212j ).\n(2.14)\nNow de\ufb01ne y(t) by\ny\u2032(t) = e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)y(t\u2212 \u03c4)\u2212 d\u2032(0)y(t), t > 0,(2.15)\ny(t) = 0 for t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0); y(0) = 1,\nthe continuous analogy of (2.12) without impulses. It is easy to show (similarly to\nthe proof of Proposition 2.1) that y(t) > 0 for all t > 0.\nApplying the Laplace transform to (2.15), and letting Y = Y (s) = L{y(t)}, gives\nsY \u2212 1 = e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\n[\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\ny(\u03be)e\u2212s(\u03be+\u03c4)d\u03be + e\u2212s\u03c4Y\n]\n\u2212 d\u2032(0)Y\nso that, since y(t) = 0 for t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0),\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL WITH IMPULSES 1859\nY =\n1\ns+ d\u2032(0)\u2212 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)e\u2212s\u03c4(2.16)\nand so\ny(t) = L\u22121\n{\n1\ns+ d\u2032(0)\u2212 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4e\u2212s\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\n}\n.(2.17)\nFrom this it is easy to see that y(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. To deduce this conclusion it\nsu\ufb03ces (by the inversion formula for Laplace transforms) to show that all the poles of\nthe function Y (i.e., the zeros of the denominator of (2.16)) are strictly in the left half\nof the complex plane. For a contradiction, assume a zero s\u02c6 exists satisfying Re s\u02c6 \u2265 0.\nThen\n|s\u02c6+ d\u2032(0)| = e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)|e\u2212s\u02c6\u03c4 | = e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)e\u2212\u03c4Re s\u02c6 \u2264 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\nso that s\u02c6 lies in the closed disk in the complex plane centered at \u2212d\u2032(0) and of radius\ne\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0). But condition (2.13) implies that this disk is entirely within the open left\nhalf of the complex plane, and this contradicts Re s\u02c6 \u2265 0. Thus y(t)\u2192 0 as t\u2192\u221e.\nThe denominator of the right-hand side of (2.16) appears on the left-hand side\nof (2.14).

In this calculation we have used the\nconvolution theorem for the Laplace transform.\nOur intention is to deduce from this that um(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e under condi-\ntion (2.13). We already know that y(t)\u2192 0 under this condition. The second term in\nthe expression (2.18) for um(t) also tends to zero as t\u2192\u221e. This is because it is the\ninverse Laplace transform of a ratio in which the numerator is an analytic function of\ns while the denominator has all of its zeros in Re s < 0 as has already been shown.\nFrom nonnegativity of um(t) for t > 0, and strict positivity of y(t), we know the\nsign of the last term in the expression (2.18) for um(t) and so we can write\n0 \u2264 um(t) \u2264 um(0)y(t) + L\u22121\n{\ne\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4 um(\u03b7)e\n\u2212s(\u03b7+\u03c4)d\u03b7\ns+ d\u2032(0)\u2212 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)e\u2212s\u03c4\n}\n.\nHence um(t)\u2192 0 as t\u2192\u221e.\n1860 R. R. L. SIMONS AND S. A. GOURLEY\n2.2.2. The case when e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4b\u2032(0) > d\u2032(0). In this subsection we shall show\nthat the zero solution of (2.8) can also be asymptotically linearly stable (i.e., the\npopulation will be driven to extinction) in the case when adult recruitment outweighs\ndeaths at low densities if culling occurs in su\ufb03cient measure and with su\ufb03cient fre-\nquency in the sense to be described below. Note that from the alternative formulation\nof the original model (2.8) if the bj \u2019s are close to 1, then it means that aggressive culling\nis taking place and a large majority of the mature species population is wiped out at\neach time tj . We can also see that even if the bj \u2019s were exactly equal to 1 and all\nthe mature species were wiped out, this would not necessarily cause extinction, be-\ncause immatures conceived at a previous time may mature at a later date. However,\nit is reasonable to speculate that if the bj \u2019s are close enough to 1 and culling takes\nplace su\ufb03ciently frequently in some sense, then the population would be driven to\nextinction.\nFor reasons that will become clear later, we need to understand the properties of\nthe function \u03c6(t) de\ufb01ned by\n\u03c6\u2032(t) = e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\u03c6(t\u2212 \u03c4)\u2212 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\u03c6(t),\n\u03c6(t) = 0, t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0), \u03c6(0) = 1.\n(2.19)\nProposition 2.3.

Strict positivity of \u03c6(t) for t > 0 follows from arguments similar to those\nin the \ufb01rst part of the proof of Proposition 2.1. Strict positivity together with (2.20)\nimmediately yields the last statement in the proposition, that \u03c6\u2217 > 0. Therefore,\nit remains to prove only (2.20). Taking the Laplace transform of (2.19) and letting\n\u03a6 = \u03a6(s) denote the Laplace transform of \u03c6, we obtain\ns\u03a6\u2212 1 = e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\n[ \u222b 0\n\u2212\u03c4\n\u03c6(\u03be)e\u2212s(\u03be+\u03c4)d\u03be + e\u2212s\u03c4\u03a6\n]\n\u2212 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\u03a6.\nSince \u03c6(t) = 0 for t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0),\n\u03a6 =\n1\ns\u2212 e\u2212s\u03c4e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\nso that\n\u03c6(t) = L\u22121\n{\n1\ns\u2212 e\u2212s\u03c4e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\n}\n=\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222b \u03c3+i\u221e\n\u03c3\u2212i\u221e\nest ds\ns\u2212 e\u2212s\u03c4e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)(2.21)\nin which the integral is the standard Bromwich integral. The quantity \u03c3 in (2.21)\ncan be taken as any real number which strictly exceeds the supremum of the real\nparts of the zeros of the denominator in the integrand. In this case we can take any\nreal \u03c3 > 0 as we now explain. Evaluation of the integral (2.21) will be via Cauchy\u2019s\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL WITH IMPULSES 1861\nresidue theorem, which requires us to identify the poles of the integrand, i.e., the zeros\nof its denominator. By inspection, one of these is clearly s = 0. We claim that the\nequation s\u2212e\u2212s\u03c4e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)+e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) = 0 has no roots satisfying Re s \u2265 0 other than\nthe root s = 0. Indeed, if Re s \u2265 0, then\n|s+ e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)| = e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)|e\u2212s\u03c4 | \u2264 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)e\u2212\u03c4Re s \u2264 e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\nso that s is in the closed disk in C with center \u2212e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) and radius e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0). But\nthis disk contains no points s with Re s \u2265 0 apart from s = 0. Therefore the poles\nof the integrand in (2.21) consist of the pole at s = 0 (which is easily checked to\nbe simple) together with the remaining zeros of the integrand\u2019s denominator, all of\nwhich satisfy Re s < 0. Evaluation of (2.21) by Cauchy\u2019s residue theorem gives an\nexpression of the form\n\u03c6(t) =\n\u2211\nres\n{\nest\ns\u2212 e\u2212s\u03c4e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) , s \u2208 P\n}\n,(2.22)\nwhere P is the set of all roots of s \u2212 e\u2212s\u03c4e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) = 0. But we know\nthat the roots of this equation are s = 0 together with other roots, all of which satisfy\nRe s < 0. It is well known that for a function f(s) of the form f(s) = h(s)\/k(s) with\nh(s) and k(s) analytic functions of s, h(a) \u0007= 0, k(a) = 0, and k\u2032(a) \u0007= 0, that the\nresidue of f(s) at the simple pole s = a is given by res {f(s); s = a} = h(a)\/k\u2032(a).\nApplying this formula to the calculation of the residue at any s \u2208 P with Re s < 0\nyields that the residue is an exponentially decaying function of t. Therefore\n\u03c6(t) = res\n{\nest\ns\u2212 e\u2212s\u03c4e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) , s = 0\n}\n+ exponentially decaying terms in t\n=\n1\n1 + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\u03c4\n+ exponentially decaying terms in t,\nand thus (2.20) holds. The proof of Proposition 2.3 is complete.\nRemark 2. Although we are assured of the strict positivity of the quantity \u03c6\u2217\nde\ufb01ned in the statement of Proposition 2.3, we point out that \u03c6\u2217 is not necessarily\nequal to the limit in (2.20). It can be shown that the convergence to the limit in (2.20)\nwill be nonmonotone if e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)\u03c4 is su\ufb03ciently large,\nOur next main result, Theorem 2.4 below, presents some conditions under which\nextinction of the population is predicted. Even though the problem under consid-\neration is the linearized problem (2.12), analysis thereof is di\ufb03cult. Our method of\nanalysis involves the use of the Euler\u2013Maclaurin summation formula [1], a technique\nfor converting sums to integrals or vice versa. We can only retain certain terms in\nthe use of this formula (those that do not involve the Bernoulli numbers), and as\na consequence the following theorem must be interpreted in an approximate sense.\nNevertheless, it is quite insightful as we will discuss later. We draw the reader\u2019s at-\ntention to the function t(\u00b7) referred to in the statement of Theorem 2.4 below. This\nfunction is not uniquely de\ufb01ned, but a sensible choice would be one that is piecewise\nlinear but smoothed at the integers so as to be di\ufb00erentiable. The function t(\u00b7) tells\nus something about the spacing of the impulse times tj (for example, if its deriva-\ntive t\u2032 is very small, then the impulse times are rather close together; under these\ncircumstances we might expect that extinction would be more likely, and this is what\nTheorem 2.4 indeed predicts). Condition (2.23) in the theorem essentially states that\n1862 R. R. L. SIMONS AND S. A. GOURLEY\nthe impulses must occur su\ufb03ciently close together in some sense depending on the\nproportion of the species that is removed at each impulse and also, not surprisingly,\non the per capita natural death rate and adult recruitment rate at low densities.\nTheorem 2.4.

Up to now we have examined a purely\ntime-dependent model in which the culling occurs only at speci\ufb01c times. The present\nsection will examine a reaction-di\ufb00usion model for the situation in which the adults\n(but not the juveniles) can move around in a random way and where culling occurs\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL WITH IMPULSES 1865\ncontinuously in time but only at speci\ufb01c points xj in a one-dimensional in\ufb01nite spatial\ndomain x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e). The equation we will analyze is\n\u2202um\n\u2202t\n(x, t) = D\n\u22022um\n\u2202x2\n(x, t) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b(um(x, t\u2212 \u03c4))\u2212 d(um(x, t))\n\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nj=\u2212\u221e\nBjum(xj , t)\u03b4(x\u2212 xj),\num(x, t) = \u03c6(x, t) \u2265 0 for (x, t) \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e)\u00d7 [\u2212\u03c4, 0]\nwith \u03c6(\u00b7, t) \u2208 L2 for each t \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0] and um(x, 0) \u0007\u2261 0.\n(3.1)\nModel (3.1) is only appropriate if the juvenile members do not di\ufb00use. This is because\nwe are using the same derivation for the adult recruitment term e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b(um(x, t\u2212 \u03c4))\nas was used to derive model (2.6). However, if the juveniles di\ufb00use, then a di\ufb00usion\nterm would have to be added to (2.2) with the consequence that the solution of the\nlatter would no longer be (2.5). Thus, our model (3.1) is for the case when only the\nadults di\ufb00use. Fortunately, this assumption is quite realistic in many species. For\nexample, in many insect species the juveniles are larvae and move very little or not\nat all. Locust larvae attach themselves to tree roots and do not move at all, whereas\nadult locusts can move great distances. The blow\ufb02y Lucilia cuprina larvae live in\nsheep and might move a little in the sense of being carried about by their host sheep\nwithin a farm, but it is only the adults that can move great distances and thereby\ntransfer infestations from farm to farm.\nSituations in which the juveniles do move appreciably can be studied too. As\npreviously noted, one would need to add to (2.2) a term representing the mobility of\nthe juveniles, with the consequence that instead of (3.1) we would have an equation\ncontaining a spatial nonlocality caused by the mobility of the juveniles. Such equations\nhave been studied extensively in recent years; see, for example, So, Wu, and Zou [9]\nor the recent survey article by Gourley and Wu [5].\nThe quantities Bj , j = 0,\u00b11,\u00b12, . . . , in (3.1) have a somewhat di\ufb00erent ecological\ninterpretation to the corresponding quantities bj in model (2.6). The quantity Bj is\nnot the proportion removed at xj but rather is a measure of the culling e\ufb00ort at that\nlocation (as will become clear in the next paragraph) and can be any nonnegative\nnumber. It is reasonable to anticipate that if the Bj \u2019s are large, then the population\nwould become extinct if either the xj \u2019s are su\ufb03ciently close together or the di\ufb00usivity\nD is su\ufb03ciently large. This is because in the limiting case when the Bj \u2019s are all\nin\ufb01nite, one can imagine that the problem e\ufb00ectively would decompose into in\ufb01nitely\nmany uncoupled problems each consisting of the partial di\ufb00erential equation in (3.1)\non the \ufb01nite domain consisting of the interval between two adjacent culling locations,\nsubject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.\nThe positioning of the delta function in (3.1) is such that the solution um(x, t)\nwill be continuous in x, but its derivative \u2202um\/\u2202x will not. If we integrate (3.1) from\nx\u2212j to x\n+\nj , the result is\nD\n[(\n\u2202um\n\u2202x\n)\nx+j\n\u2212\n(\n\u2202um\n\u2202x\n)\nx\u2212j\n]\n= Bjum(xj , t).(3.2)\nKeeping in mind that the Laplacian representation for di\ufb00usion comes about from\nusing the formula J = \u2212D\u2202um\/\u2202x for the \ufb02ux J(x, t) (de\ufb01ned as the net rate at\nwhich individuals cross x in the positive x direction), then if we imagine the do-\nmain to be broken up into subdomains de\ufb01ned by the culling locations, (3.2) has the\n1866 R. R. L. SIMONS AND S. A. GOURLEY\ninterpretation that individuals that leave the subdomain [xj , xj+1] at xj do so either\nby being culled at xj , or by entering the adjacent subdomain [xj\u22121, xj ]. The culling\ne\ufb00ort at xj is Bj , and the culling yield at this location is Bjum(xj , t) per unit time,\ni.e., proportional to the density at xj . This leads us to expect that (3.1) should have\na positivity preserving property, which is what we shall prove next. For the analysis\nof the present section, assumption (2.7) will be replaced by the following:\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < x\u22122 < x\u22121 < x0 < x1 < x2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nwith xn \u2192\u221e and x\u2212n \u2192 \u2212\u221e as n\u2192\u221e,\nBj \u2265 0 \u2200j = 0,\u00b11,\u00b12, . . . ,\nb(0) = 0, b\u2032(0) > 0, b(um) > 0 \u2200um > 0,\nd(0) = 0, d \u2208 C1[0,\u221e), d\u2032(0) > 0, d(um) > 0 \u2200um > 0.\n(3.3)\nProposition 3.1. Let (3.3) hold. Then all solutions of (3.1) which decay to zero\nas |x| \u2192 \u221e for all t \u2265 0 remain nonnegative for all t > 0.\nProof. Let us make a C1 extension to the de\ufb01nition of the death function to\num < 0 by de\ufb01ning d(um) = d\n\u2032(0)um when um < 0. Then d \u2208 C1(R). Let us \ufb01rst\nprove nonnegativity of um(x, t) for t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ] only. The proof is by contradiction.\nSuppose um goes negative on this time interval. Since um(\u00b1\u221e, t) = 0, um(x, t) must\nthen attain a negative global minimum on the set (x, t) \u2208 (\u2212\u221e,\u221e) \u00d7 (0, \u03c4 ]. Let us\n\ufb01rst consider the possibility that the minimum is attained at a point (x\u2217, t\u2217) where x\u2217\nis not one of the culling sites xj . Then x\n\u2217 is in some open interval throughout which\nthe delta function in (3.1) is inactive. Thus, um(x\n\u2217, t\u2217) < 0, um,xx(x\u2217, t\u2217) \u2265 0, and\num,t(x\n\u2217, t\u2217) \u2264 0 (noting that the minimum could be at a point with t\u2217 = \u03c4). Since\nt\u2217 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2264 0, the adult recruitment term in (3.1) is nonnegative at (x\u2217, t\u2217). Using our\nextension of the death function to um < 0, it follows that\n\u2202um\n\u2202t\n(x\u2217, t\u2217)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u22640\n= D\n\u22022um\n\u2202x2\n(x\u2217, t\u2217)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u22650\n+e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b(um(x\u2217, t\u2217 \u2212 \u03c4))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u22650\n\u2212d\u2032(0)um(x\u2217, t\u2217)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n<0\n,\nwhich is a contradiction. Now suppose that the negative global minimum is attained\nat a point (x\u2217, t\u2217) where x\u2217 is one of the xj . The delta function is active, and the\nabove argument fails. As a function of x, the function um(x, t) must now show cusp-\nlike behavior, with um(x\n\u2217, t\u2217) < 0, um,x(x\u2217\u2212, t\u2217) \u2264 0, and um,x(x\u2217+, t\u2217) \u2265 0 (if, for\nexample, the second of these were violated, then, for x just larger than x\u2217, um(x, t\u2217)\nwould be below um(x\n\u2217, t\u2217), contradicting (x\u2217, t\u2217) being the global minimum). Using\nthis information in (3.2) at time t\u2217 gives\nD\n(\n\u2202um\n\u2202x\n)\nx\u2217+\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u22650\n\u2212D\n(\n\u2202um\n\u2202x\n)\nx\u2217\u2212\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u22640\n= Bj um(x\n\u2217, t\u2217)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n<0\n,\na contradiction. Thus um(x, t) \u2265 0 for times t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ]. By the method of steps,\num(x, t) \u2265 0 for all t > 0, and the proof is complete.\nThe linearization of (3.1) about the zero solution is\n\u2202um\n\u2202t\n(x, t) = D\n\u22022um\n\u2202x2\n(x, t) + e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0)um(x, t\u2212 \u03c4)\u2212 d\u2032(0)um(x, t)\n\u2212\n\u221e\u2211\nj=\u2212\u221e\nBjum(xj , t)\u03b4(x\u2212 xj).(3.4)\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL WITH IMPULSES 1867\nWe will prove the following theorem giving conditions under which it is predicted that\nextinction will result. The quantity Binf de\ufb01ned below embodies information on the\nspacing of the culling locations. The analysis uses the Euler\u2013Maclaurin summation\nformula and therefore has to be interpreted in an approximate sense.\nTheorem 3.2. Let (3.3) hold. Let X(\u03be) : R \u2192 R be a strictly monotonically\nincreasing di\ufb00erentiable function with the property that X(j) = xj for each j \u2208 Z,\nand let B(\u03be) : R \u2192 [0,\u221e) be the piecewise linear function such that B(j) = Bj for\nall j \u2208 Z. If\ne\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) < d\u2032(0) +Binf ,(3.5)\nwhere\nBinf = inf\ny\u2208R\n{\nB(y)\nX \u2032(y)\n}\n,\nthen, provided the derivative of the function \u03be \u2192 B(\u03be)u2m(X(\u03be), t) is not too high,\nthe solution um(x, t) of the linearized problem (3.4) satis\ufb01es um(x, t) \u2192 0 in L2 as\nt\u2192\u221e, according to an analysis based on the Euler\u2013Maclaurin summation formula.\nProof. First note the following alternative formula for Binf :\nBinf = inf\ny\u2208R\n{\nB(X\u22121(y))(X\u22121)\u2032(y)\n}\n.(3.6)\nWe multiply (3.4) by um(x, t) and then integrate with respect to x over (\u2212\u221e,\u221e). As\nin the previous section, care needs to be taken to ensure that the e\ufb00ect of the delta\nfunction is not taken care of twice over. One approach (the approach we shall adopt)\nis to remove the last term in (3.4) and account for its presence in the way we treat the\nLaplacian term, using (3.2). The Laplacian term will be dealt with via integration by\nparts, and (3.2) will be used to take account of the e\ufb00ect of the discontinuities in the\nspatial derivative of um, thereby fully accounting for the e\ufb00ect of the delta function\nin (3.4).

The proof is complete.\nThe quantity Binf has the interpretation of being an in\ufb01mum culling rate per unit\ndensity per unit length, and (3.5) states that it must exceed the adult recruitment\nrate minus the natural death rate, per unit density per unit length, at low densities.\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL WITH IMPULSES 1869\nLet us discuss the situations in which the Euler\u2013Maclaurin summation as used\nhere might lose its ability to predict accurate results. Essentially, we are assuming\nthat the derivative of the function \u03be \u2192 B(\u03be)u2m(X(\u03be), t) is not too high, and one\nsituation in which this assumption might lose its validity is if the culling is aggressive\nbut the culling sites are spaced far apart. Very aggressive culling would result in the\npopulation being e\ufb00ectively zero at the actual culling sites, but if these are far apart\n(or if there is very low di\ufb00usion), there is no reason why the species should not survive\nwithin at least some of the (now decoupled) subdomains [xj , xj+1], essentially since\nindividuals would be unlikely to wander into a culling site. This can be investigated\nby solving (3.4) (without the summation term) on the domain x \u2208 (xj , xj+1) subject\nto homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Trial solutions of the form\num(x, t) = e\n\u03bbt sin\n{\nn\u03c0(x\u2212 xj)\nxj+1 \u2212 xj\n}\n, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\nexist whenever\n\u03bb+\nDn2\u03c02\n(xj+1 \u2212 xj)2 + d\n\u2032(0) = b\u2032(0)e\u2212\u03bc\u03c4e\u2212\u03bb\u03c4 ,(3.13)\nwhich is another transcendental equation for \u03bb that can be tackled using ideas similar\nto those presented earlier. Speci\ufb01cally it is possible to show that if\ne\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) < d\u2032(0) +\nD\u03c02\n(xj+1 \u2212 xj)2 ,\nthen all roots \u03bb of (3.13) satisfy Re\u03bb < 0 for every n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , giving a condition\nfor extinction of the species inhabiting [xj , xj+1], in this case of intensive culling at\nsites spaced far apart. This condition says that, at low densities, adult recruitment\nis not su\ufb03cient to o\ufb00set deaths together with losses at the ends of the domain where\nculling is occurring. If the above condition is reversed, then one can show that (3.13)\n(with n = 1) has a real positive root \u03bb, so that the species can survive in the subdomain\n[xj , xj+1].\n4. Discussion. For the purely time-dependent model the most important result\nwe have proved concerning (2.8) is Theorem 2.4, which addresses the situation when,\nat low densities, adult recruitment outweighs natural mortality. In this situation\ncondition (2.23) essentially describes culling regimes that will result in extinction.\nThe condition involves the proportions bj removed at the cull times tj , and a function\nt(\u03be), the derivative of which can be viewed as a measure of the spacing of the cull\ntimes tj .\nFrom condition (2.23) one can make several inferences. If the culling e\ufb00ort is very\nsmall, i.e., at each cull only a small proportion bj of the individuals are removed (which\ncould still vary from cull to cull), then no matter how small this e\ufb00ort is, provided\ninfj\u2208N bj > 0, extinction can still result if the culling occurs su\ufb03ciently frequently in\nthe sense that t\u2032(j) is su\ufb03ciently small for each j. A period of more aggressive culling\n(i.e., larger bj for several consecutive j) can result in extinction even when the culls\nare less frequent. An obvious particular case is that in which the culls are equally\nspaced in time; i.e., tj = jT for j = 1, 2, 3, . . . and some constant T > 0, and the\nsame proportion b\u2217 is removed at each cull. In this case the only obvious choice for\nthe function t(\u03be) is t(\u03be) = T\u03be, and thus condition (2.23) can be put in the form\ne\u2212\u03bc\u03c4 b\u2032(0) < d\u2032(0) +\nb\u2217\nT\n1870 R. R. L. SIMONS AND S. A. GOURLEY\nwhich says that, at low densities, the per capita death rate plus the proportion culled\nper unit time is too high to be compensated for by adult recruitment. Thus, the\ncondition makes sense and is what we would expect in this particular case of a \ufb01xed\nproportion being culled at equally spaced culling times.\nCondition (2.23) fails if even just one of the bj is zero; i.e., there is a \u201ccull,\u201d\nwhich we might call a zero cull, at which no animals are killed. However, provided\nonly a \ufb01nite number of the bj are zero, there will exist a time beyond which all culls\nare \u201cproper\u201d culls (i.e., culls with bj > 0), and one could shift the origin of time\nappropriately so that in condition (2.23) the in\ufb01mum would be taken starting at the\n\ufb01rst proper cull having no subsequent zero culls. More interesting is the possibility\nof in\ufb01nitely many zero culls. Mathematically, the most obvious solution is to remove\nthem by relabelling the sequence tj (i.e., passing to a subsequence of the original).\nThis would, however, have the e\ufb00ect of changing the interpolating function t(\u03be) and in\nparticular of increasing its derivative so that (2.23) would be less likely to hold. The\noutcome is that the population is less likely to be driven to extinction as expected.\nFor the model of section 3, which attempts to study culling continuously in time\nbut at discrete points in space, one can draw inferences analogous to those above for\nthe time-dependent model. The condition in Theorem 3.2 predicts extinction if the\nculling e\ufb00ort as described by the function B(y) is su\ufb03ciently large in a sense that also\ninvolves the spacing apart of the culling sites (as described by the function X(y)) as\nwe would anticipate. If the culling sites are close together, then X will have a small\nderivative and so Binf is more likely to be large enough to satisfy (3.5).\nAcknowledgment.
