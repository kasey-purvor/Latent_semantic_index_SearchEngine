We will review and critique a selection of research and\ndevelopment from the past fifty years that has linked pedagogical and learning theory to\nthe design of innovative e-learning systems and activities, and discuss their implications.\nIt will include approaches that are, essentially, behaviourist (Skinner and Gagn\u00e9),\ncognitivist (Pask, Piaget and Papert), situated (Lave, Wenger and Seely-Brown), socio-\nconstructivist (Vygotsky), socio-cultural (Nardi and Engestrom) and community-based\n(Wenger and Preece). Emerging from this review is the argument that effective e-\nlearning usually requires, or involves, high-quality educational discourse, that leads to, at\nthe least, improved knowledge, and at the best, conceptual development and improved\nunderstanding. To achieve this I argue that we need to adopt a more holistic approach to\ndesign that synthesizes features of the included approaches, leading to a framework that\nemphasizes the relationships between cognitive changes, dialogue processes and the\ncommunities, or contexts for e-learning.\nIntroduction\nMost stakeholders at all levels of education expect that innovative, improved and more\nhighly communicative pedagogies will be realized through the exploitation of new\neducational media. But has research and development in this area truly delivered findings\nthat support these anticipations? This paper will argue that it is useful to step back from\ninstitutional and practical concerns about Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) and\nonline courses, so that we can consider e-learning in terms of the underlying learning\nprocesses and interactions that are stimulated, supported or favoured by new media and the\ncontexts or communities in which they are used. (Currently, the term 'e-learning' is used\n4\nALT-J Volume 11 Number 3\nquite loosely in the literature to represent learning that is assisted, augmented or 'delivered'\nby technology. It is this typical and broad coverage of the term that is used in this article).\nWe will review and critique a selection of research and development from the past fifty\nyears that has linked pedagogical and learning theory to the design of innovative e-learning\nsystems and activities and assess the implications for e-learning design. Each initiative will\nbe dealt with concisely, and the most striking findings presented; see Ravenscroft (2001) for\na more detailed and descriptive account of some of the included approaches. This review is\nnecessarily selective and aimed at surfacing important work that is often overlooked, but\nwhich is valuable to contemporary researchers and practitioners. So the omission of\naccounts of some well referenced and relatively recent work, such as that of Laurillard\n(2002), Mayes (1993) and Duffy, Jonassen and Lowyck (1993), as well as those working in\nthe area of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) (for example,\nDillenbourg, 1999; McConnell, 2000; Kirschner, 2002) is not intended to prejudice their\ncontribution to this field. Selections are made in order to refocus and elaborate the\nlandscape of learning technology research and development from an interaction\nperspective.\nLearning as shaping behaviour: Skinner and Gagne\nArguably, the genesis of e-learning dates back to the 1950s, when educational technology\nresearchers applied behaviourist ideas to the development of 'teaching machines'. These .\nimplemented Skinner's (1954) notions of operant conditioning through reinforcement\nschedules in the context of programmed instruction. Skinner believed that behaviour was\nshaped by the reinforcing consequences delivered by the environment to responses, or\noperants, made by the student. Therefore, the emphasis was given to designing an external\nenvironment which shaped behaviour through learner-system interactions. Typically,\ninformation was presented in brief chunks, followed by questions and immediate feedback\nthat reinforced correct responses. Therein lay the main problem with the approach.\nAlthough correct behaviour was reinforced, incorrect responses, and even minor errors,\nsuch as misspellings or correct semantic substitutions, could not be dealt with because no\ndiagnostic, explanatory or remediatory strategies existed in such systems. Further, there\nwas no opportunity for reflection and intervention on the part of the student that deviated\nfrom the prescribed learning tracks.\nTo provide structure to the curriculum elements making up a learning programme, Gagne\n(1974) proposed a methodology of task analysis that enhanced both conceptual and\nprocedural knowledge under his proposed framework of intellectual skills. This enabled\nthe 'conditions' of learning, for achieving the attainment objectives, to be engineered, since\nhis analysis provided advice on both the sequencing and types of instructions required to\nmeet differing objectives. However, it soon became apparent that the interactions in these\nlearning programmes was also too limited and, in practice, the main focus was given to\ndrill-and-practice. Although this scheme can be enhanced through applying Keller's (1983)\nmotivational approach to learning, as specified by his ARCS (Attention, Relevance,\nConfidence, Satisfaction) model, this does not address its somewhat overly pre-structured\nnature.\nSumming up, both these initiatives were essentially, too prescriptive and pre-structured -\non the part of the instructional designers. Cognitive constructivists in line with Piaget\n5\nAndrew Ravenscroft From conditioning to learning communities: fifty years of research in e-learning interaction design\n(1971, 1973) and social constructivists following Vygotsky (1974), who are discussed later,\nwould emphasize that this meant that little initiative was given to the students, who had no\nopportunity for experimentation, dialogue, reflection and 'higher level' conceptual\nthinking and reasoning. Learners are not tabula rasa and they are all different. So the\nknowledge and processes they bring to an educational interaction has a significant bearing\non what and how they learn from these interchanges.\nAddressing individual differences: Pask and his colleagues\nAbout the same time as Gagne, more cognitively orientated, learner-centred approaches to\ne-learning design were also developed that addressed learner differences. Based on\nPiagetian-style experiments, the cybemeticist Pask and his colleague Scott (Pask and Scott,\n1972) identified serial (step-by-step) and holist (global) learning styles, and developed the\nCASTE (Course Assembly System and Tutorial Environment) system to support both\napproaches. This gave students control over curriculum navigation and the types of\nmaterial used in learning. In further experiments Pask and his colleagues constrained the\nsystem to support learning styles that mismatched the one identified for the learner and\nvice versa. He found that this mismatching produced inferior learning compared with trials\nthat matched the learning style with the imposed interaction style. Although the concept of\nlearning styles might be considered problematic, in that it cannot clearly predict\nconsequences, it suggests quite strongly that students have preferred methods of\ninteraction, that should be accommodated by e-learning approaches. Pask also suggested\nthat, to exploit fully the serialist-holist dimension, conversational guidance needed to be\nintroduced to ensure an appropriate mapping between learning styles and teaching\nstrategy. This was because students may not be aware of their predominant learning style.\nIndeed, Pask viewed conversation as critical in both cybernetic and conventional teaching-\nlearning contexts, stating:\nTo summarize the matter, teaching systems ought to be conversational in form and so\ndevised that strategies are matched to individual competence. (Pask, 1975, p. 222)\nA major contribution made by Pask and his colleagues was that, unlike the more\nbehaviourist-inspired approaches to design (Skinner, 1954; Gagne, 1974), they allowed\nmore learner control of the interaction and hence facilitated different learning styles, albeit\nwithin a prescribed knowledge-base. They took account of cognitive individual differences\nsuch as the serialist-holist distinction, whilst still guiding and structuring the interaction by\nplacing constraints on the path through the curriculum materials, thus achieving a blend of\nlearner freedom and tutoring guidance. Although Goodyear, Asensio, Jones, Hodgson and\nSteeples (2003) have recently suggested, in the context of an evaluation of online courses,\nthat good design and management is positive for all types of students, Pask's work points\nout that any relative value for students should be considered and addressed a priori, at the\ndesign stage. Pask also emphasized the role of dialogue, and the necessity for student and\ntutor to negotiate the most appropriate interaction style. Nevertheless there was arguably\nan epistemological drawback in this work, similar to that observed with more behaviourist\napproaches, since all the 'knowledge to be learned' had to be pre-specified. So, intensive\nknowledge engineering was required and there was no opportunity for the learner to\nexplore, assimilate or create unanticipated knowledge and information. In brief, there were\nlimited opportunities for more creative ideas and knowledge construction.\n6\nAvr-J Volume I \\ Number 3\nCognitive constructivism: Piaget, Papert and the creation of\nindividual meaning\nAn emphasis on learner-centred and activity-orientated cognitive processes for knowledge\nassimilation, creation and construction are typical features of the constnictivist paradigm,\nwhich has been developed by a number of researchers (such as Papert, 1980; Fosnot, 1996;\nJonassen, Mayes and McAleese, 1993; see Duffy et al, 1993 for a review) who have been\ninfluenced by the work of Jean Piaget (1971, 1973). Probably the most engaging\napplication of this theoretical stance within e-learning was delivered by Seymour Papert\n(1980) in his book Mindstorms and with the LOGO programming language that he\ndeveloped. Although the work of Piaget and Papert was aimed at understanding and\ndeveloping intellectual development in children, arguably their work carries broader\nsignificance, in that it focuses on processes and mechanisms - such as experimentation,\nreflection and abstraction - that are also prevalent and important in 'adult' learning.\nAccording to Piaget, the child acts on the world, with expectations about consequent\nchanges, and, when these are not met they enter into a state of cognitive conflict or\ndisequilibrium. Thus, they seek to retain an equilibrium state and so accommodate\nunexpected data or experience into their understanding of the context under exploration.\nIn a sense, the child is conceived as a scientist (Driver, 1983), setting hypotheses and testing\nthem by actively interacting with the world.\nInspired by these constructivist ideas, Papert (1980) developed the LOGO language, which\nallowed learners to create and explore their own mental models and programmed\nmicrovvorlds and thus create individual meaning for themselves. As it was originally\nconceived, each child had 'their own machine', and LOGO was designed to prompt a\npurely learner-centred interaction in which the student 'told the computer what to do' and\nobserved its response. It was a curriculum innovation, fostering 'learning by discovery',\nand allowing students to develop their own knowledge and understanding in a principled\nmanner through devising their own curriculum of activities.\nAn important finding from the evaluation studies (Sutherland, 1983; Hoyles and Noss,\n1992) was that teachers who had used LOGO were sceptical about the value of pure\ndiscovery learning, because they needed to support the interactions directly, through\nguided discussions, or indirectly by providing worksheets. So, it had to be grounded in\nauthentic discursive activity. In defence of LOGO, Papert argued that most of the studies\nwere flawed in their philosophy, measuring outcomes instead of examining the richness of\nthe interactions and the learning process. But another critical question, considering the\nparticularity of the language in relation to issues of transfer, remained unanswered. Was\nLOGO an effective cognitive tool supporting conceptual development and learning? Or,\nwas it the case that students learned to think in a 'LOGO way' only about LOGO itself?\nSituated learning: participation in authentic practice\nThe requirement for authentic learning in real situations, as compared with the relatively\nabstract and conceptual approach of LOGO, is a central tenet of situated learning (Seely-\nBrown, Collins and Daguid, 1989; Lave and Wenger, 1991). This stance is often considered\nantithetical to more cognitive approaches to learning such as those above. A position that\nis concisely proposed, in relation to new media technology, by Pea and Seely-Brown (1996):\nAndrew Ravenscroft From conditioning to learning communities: fifty years of research in e-learning interaction design\nThe situated nature of learning, remembering, and understanding is a central fact. It\nmay appear obvious that human minds develop in social situations, and that they use\ntools and representational media that culture provides to support, extend, and\nreorganize mental functioning. But cognitive theories of knowledge representation and\neducational practice, in school and in the workplace, have not been sufficiently\nresponsive to questions about these relationships. And the need for responsiveness has\nbecome salient as computational media radically reshape frontiers of individual and\nsocial action, and as educational achievement fails to translate into effective use of\nknowledge . . . In changing situations of knowledge acquisition and use, the new\ninteractive technologies redefine - in ways yet to be determined - what it means to know\nand understand, and what it means to become 'literate' or an 'educated citizen'. (Pea\nand Seely Brown, 1996, p. vii)\nSo this approach encourages us to 'explore learning as legitimate peripheral participation'\n(Lave and Wenger, 1991, p. 34) in authentic activity rather than conceive it as an ostensibly\nknowledge-based, and often abstract, process.\nWhilst providing an incisive argument for turning our attention to the local, social and\nsocio-cultural dimensions of learning, the approach surfaces some difficulties for e-\nlearning design, because it is essentially analytic rather than predictive (see also Wenger's\n(1998) work on Communities of Practice discussed later). A corollary of this, articulated in\nobjections proposed by Anderson, Reder and Simon (1996) is that situated approaches are\ntoo specific and authenticity-focused. They do not allow us to consider issues of transfer or\nthe common necessity for independent training in sub-components of complex social\nactivity (for example, independently practising your part in the orchestra). Also, work with\ncomputer simulations has illustrated another significant criticism of Anderson et al.\n(1996), that learning often requires the interplay of abstract reasoning and concrete,\nexperiential activity. It does not have to be one or the other.\nAlthough 'hard' situationists may possibly question whether computer simulations are\ntruly representative of this approach, as they predispose transfer to 'real' situations, most\nmoderate researchers are less likely to be so extreme. It is generally accepted that notions\nsuch as 'experiential learning' and 'learning by doing' fostered by simulations map onto\nsome of the central principles of situated learning (for example, see Laurillard, 1993,\n2002), as interaction emphasizes authentic activity with analogues of real situations (for\nexample, see Hartley, Ravenscroft and Williams, 1996). However, recent work has\nillustrated that simulations are more effective when both the description of the conceptions\nunderpinning interaction with the system and reflection on the consequent output is\nguided and elaborated during a dialogue with a tutor (Hartley, 1998; Pilkington and\nParker-Jones, 1996). Although some situationists would point out that this ainounts to the\nlearner 'drawing' resources from their immediate environment, it also emphasizes that in\norder to be truly powerful and effective, situated activity has to be integrated with more\ncognitive and conceptual activity, such as processes of reflection, abstraction and\ngeneralization. And these are typically stimulated, supported or favoured by high-quality\ninstructional dialogue.\nALT-] Volume 11 Number 3\nSocial constructivism: instructional dialogue and intelligent tutoring\nsystems\nThe necessity for an instructional dialogue, of a 'scaffolding' nature, between the learner\nand a tutor, or more capable other, was the focus of Vygotsky's (1978) theory of the\ndevelopment of higher mental processes. His approach makes a substantial contribution\nby linking activity situated 'in the social' to higher-order thinking and reasoning. A central\ntenet of his account is that learning occurs through internalizing dialogical activity and its\nsignification systems (such as languages) that occur in the social. So, for example he would\nargue that we develop critical reasoning skills through internalizing the process and\ncontent of dialogical argumentation.\nThis primacy of language in learning and the requirement to adapt interaction to\nindividual learners was reflected in a number of intelligent tutoring systems (hereafter ITS)\ninitiatives (for example, see Wenger, 1987) that modelled and maintained instructional\ndialogues. A number of early ITS aimed to teach the learner using a 'Socratic dialogue'\nderived from discourse analysis of human tutoring, in order to teach a subject and foster\nthe acquisition of generic reasoning skills. SCHOLAR (Carbonell, 1970) and WHY\n(Collins, 1977) used the method to teach South American geography and causal reasoning\nrespectively. However, although these systems had good semantic and syntactic natural\nlanguage properties, they had limited or shallow strategic knowledge, which remained, to a\nlarge measure, unprincipled. Later work by Clancey (1987) on a system called GUIDON\nattempted to address this through a separation of domain and pedagogical knowledge, but\nthe strategic knowledge that guided the dialogue was still too shallow. McCalla (1993) and\nRavenscroft and Pilkington (2000) have emphasized that this is only part of the problem.\nThey hold that pragmatic, or contextual dialogue features, such as the goals and relative\nroles of interlocutors, the strategies they adopt and the types of speech act they may\nperform (Searle, 1969), are neglected by much of this work, yet they have to be carefully\nconsidered in designing educational dialogue.\nSome recent work (for example, Maudet and Moore, 2000; Ravenscroft and Pilkington,\n2000) has started to reconcile this difficulty through focusing on pragmatic level dialogue\nfeatures, such as the roles and goals of interlocutors, the types of speech act they may\nperform and rules for legitimate educational dialogue. Specifically, some of these\napproaches have integrated domain knowledge within a dialogue-game approach that\nspecifies explicit dialogue strategies and tactics, with rules of initiative-taking and the\ntransfer of commitment through the types of utterances that are made (Ravenscroft and\nHartley, 1999; Ravenscroft, 2000). Ravenscroft (1997) developed a computer-based\npedagogy and approach to interaction design called 'learning as knowledge refinement'\nthat is based on a Vygotskian approach to dialogue and empirical studies of collaborative\nargumentation (Hartley, 1998). Through generalizing this approach to system development\nRavenscroft and Pilkington (2000) proposed a methodology of 'investigation by design'\n(IBD) that is currently being used to develop a number of dialogical cognitive tools that\nemphasize dialectical interaction (for example, see Ravenscroft, 2002).\nEmpirical studies, under experimental conditions, have demonstrated the effectiveness of\nthis dialogue game approach (Ravenscroft, 2000; Ravenscroft and Matheson, 2002).\nHowever, they have also highlighted the need to conceptualize the broader, socio-cultural\nAndrew Ravenscrofi From conditioning to learning communities: fifty years of research in e-learning interaction design\ncontexts and communities in which dialogues occur if we want to foster and support these\nfavoured types of discourse in more naturalistic settings.\nActivity theory: a socio-cultural approach\nAlthough Vygotsky's work is sometimes considered as socio-cultural, activity theory\narguably provides a more rigorous account of relations between learners and their social\nand cultural context. It is a development of Vygotsky's (1978) work that provides a\nframework for learning and development which accepts that meaning arises and evolves\nduring interactions that are influenced by the social relations within a community of\npractice. Or, 'you are what you do' (Nardi, 1996, p. 7) in a natural context that is influenced\nby history and culture. Hence, human practices are conceived as developmental processes\n'with both individual and social levels interlinked at the same time' (Knutti, 1996, p. 25). It\nemphasizes relationships between interactions, processes and outcomes and the relevance\nof social conditions, such as a shared enterprise and the need for mutual engagement of\nconceptualizations. Therefore, the relevance of conceptual similarities and differences and\nchanges and developments over time are taken into account in the design of mediated-\nlearning activities (for example, see Engestrom, 1987).\nIsroff and Scanlon (2001) have recently assessed activity theory in the context of\ncomputer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), and reconsidering some of their\nprevious studies using this framework. They concluded that, as it stands, activity theory is\nmore useful as a framework for describing and communicating findings, and less effective\nas a framework for uncovering 'further insights' into designing and interpreting\ncollaborative learning activities. Similarly, although Baker, Hansen, Joiner and Traum\n(1999) have used it to analyse and examine different forms of grounding in collaborative\nlearning, and Lewis (1997) has employed it in researching interdependent parameters in\ndistributed communities, its value as a prescriptive design paradigm for e-learning remains\nopen to question.\nNevertheless, this and other research (Tolmie and Boyle, 2000) has demonstrated that an\nactivity theory framework does hold some genuine value in shifting our attention to the\nrelevance of social, cultural and historical influences and relationships that are implicated\nwhen we introduce and use innovative educational technologies. It also highlights the\ncomplexities associated with the way a design is operationalized within a context as its use\ndevelops over time, and has pointed out some of the limitations in theory that need to be\naddressed. Specifically, this approach has forced us to focus on the necessity to\nconceptualize the relationship between dialogical activity and the learning communities in\nwhich it occurs.\nE-learning communities\nAccording to Preece (2000), 'The internet has given rise to a new community model of\ncommunication' (p. xii). Currently, however, there is little agreement on what this model\nactually is, how we can conceptualize it, or how it can be operationalized and exploited for\neducational purposes. Preece (2000) herself argues for Community-Centred Development\n(CCD), that accepts the sociology and social psychology of community development and\nmaintenance, putting the 'community' firmly at the centre of the design process in the same\n10\nALT-J Volume 11 Number 3\nway that Norman (1986) conceived the 'user' as central. Within this scheme she points out\nthat we need to support the evolution of communities, design for usability and plan for\nsociability. This approach seems to hold that learning should be conceived as a social\nprocess, but raises a crucial question about whether we can actually build online\ncommunities that truly satisfy the necessary social conditions for effective, and often\ndialectical, discourse interactions. Or, putting this another way, can we be sufficiently\nsocial online to have meaningful conversations, discussions and arguments that lead to\nconceptual change and development?\nThe recent work of Wenger (1998) on 'Communities of Practice' (CoP) considers meaning,\nalong with learning and identity, as important features in the educative process and holds\nthat:\nengagement in social practice is the fundamental process by which we learn and so\nbecome who we are. The primary unit of analysis is neither the individual or social\ninstitutions but rather the informal 'communities of practice' that people form as they\npursue shared enterprises over time. (Wenger, 1998: introductory notes)\nCentral to this notion, inspired by Lave and Wenger's (1991) work on 'situated cognition'\n(discussed earlier), is that these communities have knowledge about practice embedded\nwithin them, and therefore learning occurs through legitimate entry and participation\nwithin the community. Or, 'Learning is a process that takes place within a participation\nframework, not an individual mind' (Lave and Wenger, 1991, p. 15). Wenger (1998) argues\nthat effective CoP are characterized by mutual engagement, joint enterprise, shared\nrepertoire and the negotiation of meaning in practice.\nWhilst this approach, like situated cognition, provides a useful analytic framework, this\ndescriptive emphasis means that it cannot be readily articulated for e-learning design, a\npoint that is emphasized by Wenger (1988) himself. As e-learning designers we have to be\nmore prescriptive and promote learning as well as describe it. The challenge is to stimulate\nand promote the engagement in social practice that in turn leads to the formation of an\nefficient CoP. There is also a problem mapping some of Wenger's features to desired\ndiscourse practices in educational contexts. Whilst we obviously want to promote and\nidentify features such as mutual engagement, shared repertoire and negotiation of\nmeaning, other aspects such as joint accountability, diversity and partiality are not\nnecessarily appropriate in many educational contexts - except perhaps for informal\nlearning. One reason why it is not yet clear how to design, develop and maintain a CoP\nsupporting and engaging e-learning discourse is because in educational settings it is often\nunclear what the 'practice' actually is. In such contexts a greater emphasis is given to\nknowledge-based and conceptual activity rather than cooperative task-orientated activity.\nFinally, although Wenger's work has provided a valuable conceptual resource of socio-\ncultural features that should be considered when designing, cultivating and developing\ncommunication in online communities I argue that the central tenet of this approach is too\nsimplistic. When we consider the pedigree and support for more cognitive and socio-\ncognitive approaches, such as those described, we cannot accept the claim that 'Learning is\na process that takes place within a participation framework, not an individual mind'\nwithout significant qualification. Surely learning is a process that takes place within a\nparticipation framework and an individual mind.\nAndrew Ravenscroft From conditioning to learning communities: fifty years of research in e-learning interaction design\nDiscussion and implications for e-learning research and\ndevelopment\nIn considering the last fifty years in terms of the relationships between learning, or\npedagogical theory, and interaction design, what can we conclude about designing e-learning\nin the twenty-first century? Two general points are highlighted by this review. First, research\nand development that clearly links theory to design has been piecemeal, but yet has delivered\ninteresting and innovative educational systems and activities. However, in performing and\nevaluating these e-learning approaches, we have usually learned more about the learning\nprocess itself than about how to improve or optimize instruction. This is an interesting\nchallenge for researchers, but can be discouraging for practitioners, and it must be admitted\nthat, historically, the link between educational practice and learning theory has been weak.\nPerturbing the instructional process through introducing new learning technologies is bound\nto raise questions about 'what it actually takes to learn', though I argue that forcing the\nconsideration of this issue is an invaluable contribution in itself. Second, these approaches to\ne-learning have developed in a somewhat dialectical manner, where typically new approaches\nhave been adopted to address perceived shortcomings in existing ones. For example, the\nprescriptive, instructor-centredness of behaviourist approaches being superseded by more\nflexible, learner-centred constructivist approaches, that in turn had to accommodate social\nconstructivist ideas - and an increasing current emphasis on online learning communities.\nThis has lead to an increasing diversification and accumulation in approaches, with most of\nthose cited still going strong in research and practice.\nThe key point here is that we have never really 'settled on' a predominant approach or\ntheory, but instead the discipline has been characterized by a developing discourse and\ndebate about the value of particular theories and the role of theory in general (for example,\nsee Ravenscroft, 2001). I argue that familiarity with, and active participation in, this\ndiscourse, rather than favouring a particular theoretical stance, is the best way to inform\nand influence e-learning design. The implications of this point are particularly salient\nwhen we consider the main thrust of current operational developments and activities,\nwhich typically use generic VLEs that predispose rather narrow and didactic pedagogies\nwhich support a rather inflexible 'transmission' model of learning. These developments are\nundeniably driven by the available technology, which provides the sort of facilities (for\nexample, online content, CMC, student management and tracking, online assessment, etc.)\nthat integrate with existing practice rather than support innovation. This point was\nemphasized by leading UK researchers and practitioners in a recent Oxford Union debate\non 'Beyond theory: educational best practice and the use of ICT for teaching and learning'\n(see http:\/\/www.oucs.ox.ac.uk\/ltg\/events\/beyondnewf). Despite this history of relevant\nresearch, within most current institutional practice there is a paucity of innovative\npedagogies that support more dialogical, dialectical and conceptual learning processes.\nThis is the case even though a critique of previous work suggests that pedagogical\napproaches emphasizing these processes are both necessary and essential.\nHowever, I argue that there is a productive way forward if we look to develop a more\nholistic and flexible approach from ongoing and previous research that builds upon lessons\nlearned and findings across various initiatives. A key argument, that repeatedly emerges\nfrom this review - irrespective of theoretical orientation - is that effective e-learning\nusually requires or involves high-quality educational discourse that leads to - at the least -\n12\nAIT-} Volume 11 Number 3\nimproved knowledge, and - at the best - conceptual development and improved under-\nstanding. And I hold that for this to be possible we need to adopt a more sophisticated\napproach to e-leaming design that accounts for necessary relationships between cognitive\nchanges, dialogue processes and the communities, or contexts, for learning. Or, putting this\nanother way, we need a socio-cultural framework for cognitive change (Ravenscroft, 2002).\nThis suggests an approach that does not necessarily favour one theory or approach against\nanother, but instead distils from the debate features that can be transposed, applied or\nsimply used to inform our current and prospective design activities. This may, in practice,\nrequire a blend of pedagogical approaches for addressing particular learning problems (see\nbelow). Although some learning theorists may object to such marriages, arguing that they\nmay involve reconciling conflicting epistemologies, we must remember that our focus is on\nproducing high-fidelity interaction designs. We are not focusing on investigating the\npsychology of learning in the first instance, although given that no theory of learning has\nyet become an oracle, we should consider this a desirable side effect.\nTowards e-learning discourse within a socio-cultural framework for\ncognitive change\nThe framework proposed holds that learning should be redefined as the transformation and\ndevelopment of cognition, identities and communities. So we need to focus on how to\ndevelop thinking and reasoning in learners, support the social skills and presence to apply\nthese cognitive skills and cultivate active participation in improving learning communities\nor communities of practice. This means that we need to approach design in terms of a\nsynthesis of socio-cognitive and socio-cultural levels.\nThus far, work on developing educational dialogue models and system designs linked to\ncognitive change and development, that has been the focus for some investigators (see\nRavenscroft and Pilkington, 2000, for a review), has been successful and necessitated at\nleast ten years of research. So we now have a reasonable idea about what counts as patterns\nof good educational discourse, and how we can design systems that can effectively mediate\nfavoured dialogue processes in ways that, hopefully, lead to the internalization of improved\nreasoning and dialectic processes. So a significant current challenge for e-learning is how to\ndesign or develop the social conditions and communities -in online or blended situations -\nthat give rise to, or accommodate, the dialogue models and discourse practices that are\ndesired in e-learning contexts.\nA next step must be to investigate and examine e-learning communities to develop a better\nconceptualization of how and why they operate successfully, paying particular attention to\nmotivational, empathic and social issues. This should then provide the basis to either\nharmonize the operation of desired dialogue genres within existing community practice or,\nmore prescriptively, to develop communities that are aimed at supporting high-quality\ncollaborative e-learning discourse. We need to better conceptualize the way learners behave\nin e-learning communities with flexibility in the adoption of theory with respect to e-\nlearning. In considering a number of practical and ongoing initiatives Ravenscroft (2002)\nhas highlighted the difficulty of cultivating and maintaining meaningful participation in\nonline learning communities. I argue that some of these difficulties derive partly from a\nbelief that there is a driving (cognitive) intellectualism that leads learners to participate\nmeaningfully in educational discourses. But is this realistic, especially in less formal\n13\nAndrew Ravenscroft From conditioning to learning communities: fifty years of research in e-learning interaction design\nlearning contexts? Wegerif (1998) has pointed out that participants need to move from\n'outsiders to insiders' in relation to the community before they can actively participate and\nengage in meaningful discourses. One way to encourage this is by reconciling\nbehaviouristic and social constructionist approaches, through considering the stimulation,\nmotivation and reward for online behaviour as well as the need for educational discourse\nalong Vygotskian lines. Additionally, in an ever expanding new media milieu we need to\nexamine the 'invitational' features of online interaction, that could be affordances (Gibson,\n1977) provided by the technology or the activities of the online community itself. One\nexample of this approach is represented in the ongoing work of Ravenscroft, Hutchinson,\nBaur and Bradley (2003) who are integrating social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) within\na socio-cultural approach to cultivating online communities, articulated in their MOCCA\n(Maxims for developing Online Communities and Communication using Affordances)\nframework. One way this is realized practically is through devising animateurs or\nAnimator teams (A-teams) who demonstrate and stimulate types of online behaviour,\nacting as catalysts for interaction. We are planning and structuring exemplary interactions\nthat 'invite people in' and get them simply participating in the first instance. As it is hoped\nthat once learners begin to continue their participation and engage intellectually, they will\nbe achieving sufficient cognitive reward and development to continue their active\ninvolvement without animation, and so the animateur or A-team can then 'fade out',\nallowing the community to grow in an organic way.\nConclusions\nAn overarching conclusion drawn from this review is that e-learning should be considered\nwithin a more holistic, socio-cultural framework for cognitive change, that synthesizes\nrelevant features of more partisan approaches. Specifically, this means that we should focus\non relationships between dialogue interactions and the cognitive changes that represent\nlearning, and also conceptualize the contexts and communities that accommodate, favour\nor afford desirable discourse activity. This requirement for an informed theoretical\nflexibility and liberalism makes e-learning design a sophisticated endeavour. But given the\nlack of consensus about, and shortcomings of, initiatives that have adopted a more\nparticular theoretical stance, whether it be predominantly behaviourist, cognitivist,\nsituationist or whatever, I argue that this is a productive avenue for further research and\ndevelopment.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is especially grateful to Professor Roger Hartley of the University of Leeds for\ndiscussions and arguments about many included issues and commenting on this paper.\nRichard Joiner in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath also made some\nuseful comments.
