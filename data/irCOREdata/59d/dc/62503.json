Changes in water chemistry and stable isotope composition \nfrom 3 streams in west Spitsbergen were examined to assess the sources and losses of nitrogen, \nsulfur and carbon in thin organic tundra soils overlying sediments. Studies were undertaken \nfrom snowmelt (mid June) through to the end of the summer (September) in both 2001 and \n2002. Drainage water chemistry was dominated by the solution of Ca-Mg carbonates with \u03b413C \nvalues in the waters being uncharacteristically high (approx. \u20132 \u2030 at the end of the season), \nreflecting a largely open system in which the CO2 is derived equally from the atmosphere and \nplant\/soil sources.

However, as the season progressed the marine influence lessened. \nExtrapolation of the data suggests that the origin of non-sea salt \u03b434S was the oxidation of \nreduced sulfur from coal particles in the subsoil. Concentrations of inorganic N in stream \nwaters were generally very low. However, NO3- values were found to increase as the season \nprogressed, possibly through increased microbial activity in the soil and the early senescence of \ntundra plants reducing demand. Dual isotope analysis of \u03b415N and \u03b418O suggested that the vast \nmajority of snow-pack NO3- was assimilated by the soil microbial biomass before being \nreleased, recycled and lost to drainage waters. Organic N concentrations in drainage waters \nwere generally equal to or greater than losses of inorganic N from tundra soils. The study \ndemonstrated the effectiveness of stable isotope data for understanding biogeochemical cycling \nand soil-water interactions in tundra ecosystems. The implications of the results are discussed \nin relation to climate warming.      \n \n \n   \n 3  \n1. INTRODUCTION  \nStudies of chemical budgets and hydrochemistry in the European High Arctic have largely \nfocused on glacial catchments (Tranter et al. 2002; Wadham et al. 2004; Hodson et al. 2005; \nWynn et al. 2006). These systems have major roles in (i) regulating the biogeochemical cycling \nof nutrients that may impact both freshwater and marine ecosystems and (ii) in our \nunderstanding of cryosphere-atmosphere interactions and the potential feedbacks that \ncontribute to climate regulation (Tranter et al. 2002). The evolution of snowmelt chemistry in \nthese glacial catchments is largely influenced by the presence of meltwater derived from stored \nglacial ice and snow and the substantial contribution of solutes released during the weathering \nand leaching of underlying rock and glacial tills (Hodson et al. 2005). In contrast, relatively \nlittle published work exists regarding the chemistry of soil-water interactions in those parts of \nthe polar tundra free of the complications of glacial systems in the European High Arctic. In \nSpitsbergen, Stutter & Billett (2003) undertook chemical analysis on a range of stream and \ndrainage waters draining different tundra vegetation types from Dicksonland, whilst Pecher \n(1994) examined temporal changes in surface and soil pore waters in Liedefjorden. Hodson et \nal. (2002) and Cooper et al. (2002) both examined changes in the hydrochemistry of glacial \nmeltwater streams that had major drainage contributions from tundra.  \n \nThis paper reports work examining the hydrochemistry of drainage waters from low-lying \ncoastal tundra. These areas are generally drained via small streamlets or drainage gulleys that \noften include an element of overland flow. Sources of water include melting snow, springs that \nare generated partially from melting soil moisture, and precipitation. These areas are often \ncharacterised by thin organic soils overlying sediments, and are a potential source of nutrient \nenrichment to fjords and the ocean. Changes in the major element hydrochemistry of the \ndrainage waters in conjunction with their stable isotope composition were analysed from the \nonset of snowmelt and through the snow free period that occurs during the summer in the High \nArctic.  \n   \n 4  \n \nIt is anticipated that weathering processes of the sub-soil sediment, and biogeochemical cycling \nwithin the thin organic soil will determine the solute composition of the waters draining tundra \nsoils. However, some nutrient enrichment of fjordal and coastal waters from tundra soils may \nalso occur from the long-range transport of pollutants such as reactive nitrogen deposited and \nlater released from the snowpack. A key aim of this study was to assess the relative \ncontributions in the drainage waters of atmospheric (snowpack) and soil (microbially) derived \nNO3-. Increased deposition of atmospheric reactive N, emitted and transported from \nindustrialised areas (Mosier et al. 2001), has been recorded and may impact delicate N-limited \necosystems. Evidence of this increased deposition has been found in firn ice cores from many \nparts of the Arctic, where a doubling of inorganic N concentrations has occurred since the \nindustrial revolution (Laj et al. 1992; Fischer et al. 1998; Simoes and Zagorodnov, 2001). The \ninputs of reactive N have been found to vary with geographical position and proximity to \nanthropogenic sources (Jaffe and Zukowski, 1993). Consequently, yearly atmospheric N \ndeposition is estimated to be ~1.2 kg ha-1 yr-1 in the Norwegian high Arctic, but ~10 kg ha-1 yr-1 \non the Taymyr Peninsular in Russia and parts of northern Alaska (Woodin, 1997). Research \nhas shown that during winter, reactive N is deposited in the snowpack and is released at \nsnowmelt in the early summer. It then contributes to a pulse of N to terrestrial ecosystems that \nare effectively \u2018switching on\u2019 for the summer growing period (Russell, 1990). Initial research, \nlargely on alpine tundra and high elevation catchments, suggested that this pulse of N was \neither a result of: (a) preferential elution of snowpack NO3- and\/or; (b) the flushing of NO3- \nproduced by microbial nitrification throughout the winter. However, recent research has \nsuggested that atmospherically derived NO3- may enter a period of temporary storage in the \nsoil microbial biomass (Sickman et al. 2003) or in plants (Bilborough et al. 2002) before being \nre-released as organic forms of N, back into the terrestrial N cycle. Therefore, this work \nattempts to quantify the inputs of snowpack deposited N and its subsequent fate in a High \nArctic location.   \n   \n 5  \n2. SITE DESCRIPTIONS AND METHODS \n2.1 Streams \nSampling was undertaken at 3 streams on the shores of Kongsfjorden, close to the research \nsettlement of Ny \u00c5lesund, Svalbard (78o54\u2032N, 11o53\u2032E; Figure 1). Kongsfjorden is 20 km long \nand varies in width between 4 and 20 km. The landscape surrounding the fjord has been shaped \nby glacial activity with active glacial, hydro-glacial, periglacial and coastal processes still \ncontinuing (Svendsen et al. 2002). Mean annual precipitation is 412 mm. The prevailing wind \ndirection is from the south east with a second mode from the north-west (Svendsen et al. 2002). \nAverage air temperatures start to drop below freezing in early September, reaching a mean \nmonthly temperature of -17oC in February, before rising above freezing in early June to reach a \nmean monthly temperature of +5oC in July (http:\/\/isohis.iaea.org). Snow starts to accumulate \nfrom December onwards, building to depths of ~ 0.5 m in flat, shoreline areas, and melting in \nJune. Thawing of the soil during the summer extends to a permafrost depth of about 1m (Roth \nand Boike, 2001).  \n \n2.1.1. Stream 1. \nThe principal site, sampled in 2001 and 2002, was a small catchment draining into \nKohamnlaguna, on the shore south of Brandalpynten, about 2 km north west of Ny \u00c5lesund \n(Stream 1, Figure 1). The site has a maximum altitude of 25 m, covers about 2 ha, and in \nsummer comprises a low gradient, boggy basin bounded on the north and south by drier, \nslightly raised gravelly areas, and on the west, at the head of the catchment, by the slopes of a \nseries of rock and gravel terraces. These terraces represent raised beach sequences, which are a \nmajor geomorphological feature of the Br\u00f6ggerhalv\u00f6ya peninsula, and characterise the late \nWeichselian and Holocene history of sea level in this part of Spitsbergen. The Br\u00f6ggerhalvoya \npeninsula emerged when glacial-isostatic rebound exceeded the sea level rise leaving three \nlarge beach ridges that are found at ~29, 37 and 45m altitude. The ridges are between 100 \u2013 \n200 m wide with a relief of ~5m. Below 20m, as in this study site, a series of narrow (5-10m) \n   \n 6  \nand low (< 2m) strandlines are found that reach to the present shoreline where a barrier beach \nridge is actively forming (Forman et al. 1987). Radiocarbon dating of whalebones has been \nused to date relative sea level change on Br\u00f6ggerhalvoya. Deglaciation is considered to have \noccurred in two steps. Initial unloading of the ice could have involved the break up of the \nmarine-based ice sheet on the Spitsbergen bank in the Barents sea approximately 13000 yrs \nB.P., followed by the second step that resulted in the deglaciation of the major fjords by about \n9000 B.P. (Forman et al. 1987). A thin (typically < 4 cm) organic soil horizon has developed \non the better drained areas. Vegetation was similar to that of an adjacent study area described \nby Tye et al. (2005). Bryophytes and Salix polaris grow on the organic soil, with a thick moss \ncarpet common in the basin along with a cryptogamic crust including species of the blue-green \nalgae Nostoc. In summer several streams run east through the basin to the shore. The largest \nstream, Stream 1, was selected for sampling. As the total catchment drainage was over a broad \narea, and not on bedrock, it could not be accurately gauged. \n \n2.1.2. Streams 2 and 3. \nTwo additional streams (Streams 2 and 3 in Figure 1) were sampled in 2002 to provide data \nsupplementary to that obtained from Stream 1. Stream 2 was a small stream running to the \nshore to the west of Brandalpynten, and draining ground similar to that surrounding Stream 1 \nabout 1 km away. Samples were also collected in 2002 from a gauging station of the \nNorwegian Polar Institute (Norsk Polarinstitutt) on a stream draining part of the island of \nBlomstrandhalv\u00f8ya (Stream 3). This catchment is characterised by a higher altitude (369 m at \nthe highest point), steeper gradient slopes, more visible bedrock consisting of the Generalfjella \nFormation Marbles (Harland, 1998) of Devonian age, and relatively little soil cover compared \nwith the area drained by Streams 1 and 2.  \n \n   \n 7  \n2.2. Sampling and analysis \nThe snowpack in the catchment of Stream 1 was sampled in late April of 2001 and 2002. For \nchemical analysis, fifteen snow cores were collected over a 100 x 100 m area using a 4.9 cm \ndiameter plastic tube inserted down to the base of the snowpack, and the snow transferred to a \npre-conditioned plastic bag. Snow depth, volume and weight from each core were determined \nso snowpack density could be calculated. Estimates of NO3- and NH4 inputs on a kg.ha-1 basis \nwere derived by combining depth and density measurements from each core to estimate snow \nwater equivalent (SWE). The concentrations of NO3- and NH4 were multiplied by the SWE to \nobtain snowpack contents (Sickman et al. 2003). Samples for 15N\/14N, 34S\/32S and 18O\/16O \nisotope analysis, of up to 80 kg snow, were collected from a smaller number of pits in the same \narea (Heaton et al. 2004). In 2002, ice samples from the bottom of the snow pack were \ncollected by chiselling ice out from known areas. The ice was weighed, allowing the \ncalculation of density and SWE. Inputs of NO3- and NH4 were calculated in a similar manner \nas for the snow.   \n \nSamples of drainage waters were collected from Stream 1, at approximately weekly intervals, \nduring mid June to early September of 2001, and at Streams 1, 2 and 3 during mid June to early \nSeptember of 2002. For Stream 1 [data for Stream 2 are not presented], estimates of flow rate \n(Figure 2) were determined by damming the drainage channel just above the collection point \nand diverting the flow via guttering pipe from which the volume of water per minute was \ndetermined. Samples for chemical analysis were collected in 1 L LDPE bottles. Samples of up \nto 100 L in jerry cans were collected for 15N\/14N, 18O\/16O and 34S\/32S analysis, and 500 mL in \npolycarbonate bottles for inorganic 13C\/12C analysis. The latter samples, which were free of any \nturbidity, were collected unfiltered to avoid potential loss of CO2, and the TDIC (total \ndissolved inorganic carbon) immediately precipitated as barium carbonate by addition of \nalkaline barium chloride. Two samples filtered before addition of barium chloride showed no \ndifference from their unfiltered counterparts. \n   \n 8  \n \n2.2.1. Post Sample Collection Procedures \nOn return to Ny \u00c5lesund samples for chemical analysis were filtered through 0.45 \u03bcm nylon \nfilters into LDPE bottles. Separate sub-samples were taken for major cation (Ca, Mg, K, Na), \nmajor anion (Cl, NO3-N, SO4-S, HCO3-) and DOC\/DON (dissolved organic carbon \/ dissolved \norganic nitrogen) analysis, and a further sub-sample was acidified with 10 % HCl for NH4+ \nanalysis.  All samples were stored at <4\u00b0C.  Barium carbonate was recovered by filtration and \nwashing through 0.8 \u03bcm filter paper and dried at 50\u00b0C to constant weight. \nOf the large samples for isotope analysis, a small unfiltered portion was retained for water \n2H\/1H and 18O\/16O analysis, and the remainder passed through ion exchange resins in the \nmanner described elsewhere (Heaton et al. 2004). Ammonium recovered from the cation resin \nwas converted to ammonium sulfate on quartz filter paper using a static alkaline diffusion \nmethod (Sigman et al. 1997; Heaton, 2001). Sulfate was eluted from the anion resin and \nconverted to barium sulfate (by precipitation with barium chloride). NO3- was eluted from the \nanion resin using 3M HCl, neutralised with silver oxide (Ag2O) and freeze dried to silver \nnitrate (AgNO3) (Silva et al. 2000; Heaton et al. 2004). \n \n2.2.2. Chemical Analysis \nAlkalinity (predominately HCO3-) was determined within 10 days of collection through \ncolourimetric titration using a BDH pH 4.5 indicator. NO3- and NH4 were determined \nimmedately after collection. Nitrate was determined after reduction to nitrite using the \ncolourmetric method of Mackereth et al. (1989) with 4 cm cells (no initial nitrite was \ndetectable in any samples during this study). The detection limit was 0.21 \u03bcm L-1 and the \nprecision errors were calculated at 0.25 to 2 % at 2.85 \u03bcm L-1 for different analytical runs. \nAmmonium was determined using salicylate and sodium dichloroisocyanurate solutions \n(HMSO, 1981). Detection limits were 0.21 \u03bcm L-1 and analytical precision was < 5 % at 7.13 \n\u03bcm  L-1. In Nottingham, Ca, Mg, Na, K were determined using flame atomic absorption \n   \n 9  \nspectrometery. Analytical precisions were calculated to be between 0.2 \u2013 3.5 % for Ca at 125 \n\u03bcm L-1, 1.2 to 8.3 % for Mg at 411 \u03bcm L-1, 1.4 to 2.3 % for Na at 109 \u03bcm L-1 and 0.4 to 2.3 % \nfor K at 12.8 \u03bcm L-1. Anions (Cl-, SO42-) were measured using ion chromatography. Analytical \nprecision was between 5 to 8 % for Cl- at 282 \u03bcm L-1 and 3.7 to 5 % for SO42- at 124 \u03bcm L-1. \nMean charge balance errors (CBE in %) were calculated as  \n( )( )\u2211 \u2211\u2211 \u2211 \u2212+\n\u2212+\n+\n\u2212=CBE   \nwhere \u03a3- and \u03a3+ are the combined equivalents of the measured anions (HCO3-, SO42-, Cl- and \nNO3-) and the cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) respectively. Analysis of DOC and DON was carried \nout using a Shimadzu Total Organic Carbon (TOC) \/ Total organic nitrogen (TON)-V analyzer. \nAnalytical precision was 3.9% for DOC at 166 \u03bcm L-1 C and 9.8 % for DON at 36 m\u03bc L-1 N.  \n \n2.2.3. Stable Isotope Analysis \n2H\/1H, 13C\/12C, 15N\/14N, 18O\/16O and 34S\/32S ratios were determined in VG SIRA, VG Optima, \nand Finnigan Delta+ isotope ratio mass spectrometers, and are reported as \u03b4 values where: \n\u03b42\u0397, \u03b413C, \u03b415N, \u03b418O, \u03b434S (in per mille) = [(Rsample\/Rstandard)\u20131] x 1000 \nfor R = 2H\/1H, 13C\/12C, 15N\/14N, 18O\/16O and 34S\/32S, respectively. \n \nThe standards are: VSMOW for \u03b42\u0397, and for \u03b418O of water, NO3- and SO4-; VPDB for \u03b413C, \nand for \u03b418O of carbonate; atmospheric N2 for \u03b415N; and VCDT for \u03b434S. Corrections to these \nstandards were undertaken by comparison of samples to within-run materials: waters calibrated \nagainst VSMOW and SLAP; a calcite calibrated against NBS-19 and NBS-18; IAEA-N-1 \nammonium sulfate (assumed \u03b415N = +0.4\u2030); IAEA-NO3 potassium nitrate (assumed \u03b418O = \n+25.6\u2030); and a barium sulfate calibrated against NBS-127 (assumed \u03b418O = +9.3\u2030, \u03b434S = \n+20.3\u2030). \n \n   \n 10  \nPrecision of replicate analyses of samples was generally better than \u00b1 1\u2030 for \u03b42\u0397H2O, \u00b1 0.3\u2030 \nfor \u03b413CTDIC, \u00b1 0.1\u2030 for \u03b418OH2O, \u00b1 0.3\u2030 for \u03b418OSO4, \u00b1 0.3\u2030 for \u03b434SSO4, and \u00b1 0.4\u2030 for \n\u03b415NNH4. As discussed below, precision for \u03b415NNO3 and \u03b418ONO3 was dependent on the degree \nto which the silver NO3- was contaminated by organics (Heaton et al. 2004); uncontaminated \nsamples generally replicate better than \u00b1 0.4\u2030 for \u03b415NNO3, and \u00b1 1\u2030 for \u03b418ONO3. \n \n3. RESULTS \n3.1 Snow at Site 1 \n3.1.1. Chemistry \nThe average compositions of the snowpack at Site 1, based on several cores taken over an area \nof about 1 ha in April 2001 and April 2002, are shown in Table 1. Average snow depths and \ndensities for the sampled cores were 37 cm (range: 25-60cm) at 0.33 gm.cm-3 in 2001, and 25 \ncm (range: 10-45 cm) at 0.31 gm.cm-3 in 2002. Frequent freeze-thaw cycles in the early winter \ncommonly lead to the formation of an ice lens at the base of the snowpack (Gerland et al. \n1999), and this was sampled at four core locations in 2002 (Table 1). Mean thickness of the \nbasal ice layer sampled in 2002 was 14 cm (range 10-22 cm; SD = 5.5 cm). Basal icing across \nour study area was extensive. In 2001 a walk over survey carried out during snowmelt \nsuggested the mean ice layer was approx. 10 cm thick (n = 8). Variations in the thickness of the \nbasal ice reflected the undulations of the surface; ice depth being deeper in depressions where \nmeltwater or precipitation could accumulate on frozen soil, and little ice appearing on the very \nhighest parts on the surface. During the spring melt, much of the ice remained after the \nmajority of the snow had melted. However, it was apparent that meltwater collected on top of \nthe ice during snowmelt as well as infiltrating beneath it. In addition, single samples of fresh \nsnow were collected within a few hours of falling on 23 April 2001, and 5 April 2002 (Table \n1). \n \n   \n 11  \nThe major ion chemistry of the snowpack on Brandalspynten was dominated by Na and Cl-, \nwith snowpack Na\/Cl-, K\/Cl- and Mg\/Cl- ratios similar to those of seawater, and snowpack \nCa\/Cl- and SO4\/Cl- ratios slightly elevated relative to seawater (Table 1). There was less of a \nmarine influence found in the chemical analyses of the ice layers and fresh snowfall. NO3- and \nNH4 concentrations were similar to those reported from other parts of Svalbard (Caritat et al. \n2005; Hodson et al. 2005; Wynn et al. 2006). Combining snowpack chemical and density data, \ninputs of NO3-N and NH4-N from the snow pack were estimated to be 59 and 30 g ha-1 in 2001, \nand 18 and 12 g ha-1 in 2002, respectively. Measurement of the 2002 basal ice-lens, however, \nindicated that it contributed an additional 33 g ha-1 NO3-N and 6 g ha-1 NH4-N. \n \n3.1.2. Isotope data \nThe snowpack displayed large spatial variations in \u03b42HH2O and \u03b418OH2O values (e.g. up to 5\u2030 \nrange in \u03b418OH2O between cores). All samples, however, including the ice at the base of the \n2002 snowpack, lay close to the Global Meteoric Water Line (Rosanski et al. 1993) \ncollectively defining a relationship \u03b42HH2O = 7.8\u00b7\u03b418OH2O +12. Weighted mean \u03b42HH2O and \n\u03b418OH2O values for the 2001 snowpack were -65\u2030 and -10.0\u2030, and for the 2002 snowpack \nplus ice layer were -73\u2030 and -10.4\u2030, and may be compared with the long-term weighted \nmean for October to April precipitation at Ny Alesund: \u03b42HH2O = -78\u2030; \u03b418OH2O = -11.3\u2030 \n(data for 1990-2001 at http:\/\/isohis.iaea.org). \n \n \nThe \u03b434SSO4 values and SO42-\/Cl- ratios of the snowpack were typical of precipitation in coastal \nareas, and suggest a dominant contribution of seawater sulfate with \u03b434SSO4 = +21\u2030, together \nwith a smaller amount of atmospheric sulfate which normally has lower \u03b434SSO4 values \n(Wadleigh et al., 1996, 2001). The \u03b418OSO4 values for the snowpack sulfate were also typical \n   \n 12  \nfor precipitation, but generally do not allow distinction between marine and non-marine \nsources (Wadleigh et al., 1996). \n \nThe \u03b415NNH4 values for snow (Table 1) were within the range of values typically reported for \nprecipitation from a limited number of studies in other areas (c. -8 to +2\u2030), and \u03b418ONO3 for \nthe snow were within the upper range of values reported for other parts of the globe (c. +20 to \n+80\u2030; Heaton et al. 1997; Kendall, 1998; Heaton et al. 2004). In contrast, \u03b415NNO3 values, \nparticularly for the 2001 snow, were markedly lower than the typical c. -5 to +5\u2030 range for \natmospheric NO3- from other parts of the globe. The Ny Alesund snow \u03b415NNO3 values bore \nsimilarities to atmospheric NO3- in Antarctica, and may reflect a component of \nstratospherically-derived NO3- (Heaton et al. 2004). \n \n3.2. Stream 1 \n3.2.1. Flow \nThe earliest stages of snowmelt resulted in slumping of the snowpack, but with the initial \nliquid water still held within the remaining snow porosity. Stream flow, and the collection of \nstream water could therefore only begin towards the end of the snowmelt, when some bare \nground or ice was apparent that allowed overland flow to begin. At this point the tundra \nconsisted of semi-frozen soil with about 75% of the area covered with a patchwork of snow \nand ice. Figure 1 shows the flow rate of Stream 1 at each sampling time shown on the graphs \nas day number. In Tables 2 & 3 day numbers are presented with equivalent dates. In the earliest \nperiod of sampling, corresponding to the main snowmelt phase, high flow in the Stream 1 was \naugmented by wide-scale overland flow via several smaller streams. After snowmelt, flow rate \nrapidly declined and was linked to the melting of a snow bank on the gravel terrace escarpment \nslope at the head of the catchment (persisting to mid-July), thawing of frozen soil moisture \n(sometimes appearing as springs at the foot of the escarpment), and summer precipitation of \n   \n 13  \nsnow or rain (Figure 2). In the summer of 2002, flow completely dried up for 12 days between \nday 189 and 201.  \n \n3.2.2. Chemistry \nTable 2 reports concentrations of major cations and anions in Stream 1. Mean charge balances \nfor 2001 and 2002 were +3.09 and -0.28 % respectively. To compensate for possible dilution \neffects, and on the assumption that Cl- is conservative, water chemistry is examined relative to \nchloride \u2013 i.e. as ion\/Cl- ratios. Thus in Figure 3 we display the temporal changes in water \nchemistry of Stream 1 in terms of ion\/Cl- ratios, and compare these with measured ion\/Cl- \nratios from the snowpack which are marked arbitrarily at day 150.  \n \nCa\/Cl- and Mg\/Cl- ratios (Figure 3a & 3b) in the earliest stream samples rose rapidly above \nthose of the snowpack, and continued to rise slightly throughout the latter part of the drainage \nperiod. These increases were closely matched by increases in HCO3- so that \n2\u00b7(Ca + Mg)\/HCO3-, on a molar basis, maintained a value close to 1. Na\/Cl- and K\/Cl- (Figure \n3c & 3d) ratios in the streamwater showed little change over the 11 week sampling periods, \nwith Na\/Cl- ratios remaining essentially similar to their seawater ratios in the initial snowpack, \nand K\/Cl- ratios being slightly higher than in the initial snowpack. The SO42-\/Cl- ratio (Figure \n3f) started close to that of the snowpack before increasing progressively with time. \nConcentrations of inorganic N are displayed as NO3-\/Cl- ratios and NH4\/Cl- ratios in Figures \n3(g) and 3(h), respectively. During the early part of the summer, from the onset of snowmelt in \nmid-June to about mid-July (2002) or late July (2001), NO3\/Cl- ratios remained similar to those \nof the initial snowpack. Thereafter the ratios rose progressively to the end of sampling in early \nSeptember. The rise in NO3-\/Cl- ratios in July reflected an increase in NO3- concentrations \n(Table 2) whose timing did not appear to correspond to changes in any other chemical \nparameter, but was at a time when the tundra flora was tending towards senescence. In 2002, \n   \n 14  \ntwo samples with particularly high NO3- concentrations and NO3-\/Cl- ratios (days 201 and 231) \ncorresponded to the occurrence of rainfall following prolonged dry periods. \n \nNH4\/Cl- ratios in Stream 1 started similar to those of the snowpack, and remained fairly \nconstant (2001), or declined slightly (2002) during the summer. The exception was a high \nNH4\/Cl- ratio in late June 2001 (day 173), associated with a day of 16 mm rainfall. \n \nConcentrations of both DOC and DON in the stream water peaked during the middle of the \nstudy period in 2002. However, Figure 3(i) shows that the DON\/Cl- ratio remained fairly \nconstant during the study period. The DOC\/Cl- ratio decreased slightly as the season \nprogressed (Fig 3j). The DOC\/DON ratio varied between 13-29, generally slightly lower than \nvalues obtained from high elevation catchment streams reported by Williams et al. (2001) and \nHood et al. (2003) (Fig 3k). Concentrations of DON, measured in 2002, were almost always \nhigher than the total inorganic nitrogen (Table 2). In common with NO3-, enhanced DON and \nDON\/Cl- ratios were associated with rainfall following prolonged dry periods (days 201 and \n231).  \n \n3.2.3. Isotope data \n\u03b42HH2O and \u03b418OH2O values for Stream 1 waters started off similar to those of the initial \nsnowpack, with a change to slightly higher values overall during the summer (Figure 4). The \nrelationships between \u03b42HH2O and \u03b418OH2O, defined by all the stream waters, were \u03b42HH2O = \n4.9\u00b7\u03b418OH2O -22 for 2001, and \u03b42HH2O = 6.0\u00b7\u03b418OH2O -16 for 2002. In both cases these \u2018slopes\u2019 \nwere lower than those of the snowpack (7.8, above). \n \nFigure 5 displays the \u03b434S values of sulfate in Stream 1 as a function of the percentage of \nnon-sea-salt sulfate (NSSS). The latter was calculated on the assumption that sea-salt has a \n   \n 15  \nSO42-\/Cl- ratio of 0.052 and was the source of all Cl in the stream water; thus \n% NSSS = [1-(0.052 x Cl\/SO4)]\u00b7100 (Newman et al. 1991). The data for the 2001 and 2002 \nStream 1 samples display very similar, clearly linear trends of decreasing \u03b434SSO4 with \nincreasing NSSS, and collectively define a relationship: \u03b434SSO4 = -0.21\u00b7(% NSSS) + 18.9, \nr2 = 0.93, with snowpack samples lying close to this line (Figure 4). Bearing in mind the \nsimplified assumptions in calculating % NSSS, confidence is justified by the fact that the \nintercept at +18.9\u2030 is close to the \u03b434SSO4 value for modern seawater (+21\u2030). The pure, 100% \nNSSS end-member has a calculated \u03b434SSO4 value of -2.1\u2030. \n \nThe \u03b418O values for sulfate in all but the first Stream 1 sample of 2001 were between -0.3 and \n+1.4\u2030, and significantly lower than the values for the snowpack (+9.5 and +9.7\u2030). Plotted on \nthe same basis as above, a linear relationship for the sulfate oxygen: \u03b418OSO4 = -0.05\u00b7(% NSSS) \n+ 4.6, r2 = 0.41, is not as clear as that for sulfate sulfur, with the +4.6\u2030 intercept being lower \nthan the \u03b418OSO4 value for seawater (+9.5\u2030). The calculated pure NSSS end-member \u03b418OSO4 \nvalue of -0.4\u2030 is within the large range reported for limited data from glacial catchments \n(Bottrell and Tranter, 2002; Wadham et al. 2004). \n \nAs pH values were close to neutral, the TDIC should be dominantly present as HCO3-. Changes \nin \u03b413CTDIC values are listed in Table 2, and displayed for 2002 in Figure 6. In 2002, the earliest \ndrainage waters of Stream 1, occurring during the snowmelt period of high flow and low \nHCO3-, had \u03b413CTDIC of -7.5\u2030. With the higher HCO3- concentrations found throughout the \nremainder of the season the \u03b413CTDIC values were maintained between -4.4 and -1.5\u2030. These \nvalues are high: considerably higher than those typical of drainage waters in temperate regions \n(usually <-6\u2030), and at the upper end of ranges reported for water from glaciated catchments \n(Aucour et al. 1999; Telmer and Veizer, 1999; Wadham et al. 2004; Spence and Telmer, 2005). \n \n   \n 16  \nYields of inorganic N from the 2001 resins were only sufficient for \u03b415NNO3 analysis of two \nlate season samples (Table 3a), and insufficient for \u03b415NNH4 analysis. For the 2002 samples \n(Table 3b) \u03b415NNO3 values exhibited a fairly narrow range, -1.9 to +1.9\u2030, higher than that of \nthe initial snowpack (-6.9\u2030). Six stream water \u03b415NNH4 values displayed a broader range, -7.2 \nto -0.7\u2030, slightly lower than the snowpack (-0.3\u2030). \n \nDifficulties associated with the preparation of pure silver nitrate, and the resulting \nconsequences for \u03b418O analysis of NO3-, have been discussed previously (Heaton et al. 2004). \nTable 3 displays the measured \u03b415N and \u03b418O values of silver nitrate samples together with \ntheir C\/N (weight) and N\/O (atomic) ratios. The C contents reflect contamination of the silver \nnitrate by organic matter, which should not substantially affect the measured \u03b415N values but, \nthrough the presence of relatively large amounts of organic O, does affect the apparent \u03b418O \nvalues (Heaton et al. 2004). The presence of contaminant O was evident from the N\/O ratios, \nwhich should be 0.33 for pure nitrate, but were commonly much lower than this in the silver \nnitrate prepared from the Stream 1 samples (Table 3). The measured \u03b418O values and N\/O \nratios are plotted in Figure 7 and compared with contamination-corrected values for snowpack \nNO3-. The stream NO3- samples displayed a well-defined linear trend of \u03b418O values from -5 to \n0\u2030 at N\/O ratios of 0.33 (i.e. for pure NO3-), to an extrapolated value between +15 and +25\u2030 \nat N\/O ratios near zero (i.e. for the contaminant end-member). None of the stream NO3- \nsamples had \u03b418O values deviating significantly from this trend. There is therefore no evidence \nfor snowpack NO3-, with its characteristically high \u03b418O values of +70 to +80\u2030, being present \nin the drainage waters of Stream 1. \n \n3.3. Stream 2 and Stream 3 \nThe 2002 chemistry of Stream 2 is shown in Table 4. Low rainfall meant that samples could \nnot be collected during July to mid August. But for the early summer and late summer samples \n   \n 17  \nthe pattern of major ion concentrations, ion\/Cl ratios and isotope compositions were generally \nvery similar to those of the nearby Stream 1. Stream 3, on Blomstrandhalv\u00f8ya, showed \nsimilarities to Stream 1 in the main weathering processes (Table 5): e.g. a marked increase in \nHCO3- matched by increased Ca + Mg (though with a lower proportion of Mg in Stream 3); \nvery similar \u03b413C values; and SO42- displaying a progressive rise, with the proportions of NSSS \napproaching 90% towards the end of summer. In contrast, Stream 3 had considerably lower \nconcentrations of Na and Cl, and quite different abundances of inorganic nitrogen: NO3- and \nNH4 concentrations being significantly lower in Stream 3 compared with Stream 1. DON \nconcentrations were found to be below detection limits whilst DOC concentrations appeared to \nbe highest between Day 176 and 194 before declining towards the end of the season, a pattern \nreplicated by the DOC\/Cl- ratio (results not shown). \n \n4. DISCUSSION \n4.1 General chemistry \nThe chemistry of the earliest stream waters, sampled during the period of high overland flow \nduring the main snow-melt phase in mid-late June, clearly reflected the chemistry of the \nsnowpack, which was dominated by salts of marine origin: high Na and Cl contents, with \nconcentrations of Na, Cl, Mg and K, and the \u03b434SSO4 values, very similar to those of seawater. \nIt is possible that much of this salt, sampled in the snowpack in April, resulted from wind \ntransfer from the neighbouring Kongsfjorden, rather than by precipitation in snow. Transfer of \nsea salts could have been from sea spray blown from the unfrozen fjord. Alternatively, when \nthe fjord is frozen high concentrations of sea salt can accumulate in the surface layers of snow \ncovering sea ice, and this snow is readily swept on-shore by the common easterly winds \n(Domine et al. 2004). This mechanism would account for the concentration of marine salt at \nStreams 1 and 2 being higher than those at Stream 3. The latter site has a catchment elevation \n(up to 369 m) much higher than the former sites (up to 25 m), and is therefore less likely to \nintercept wind drift from the fjord. \n   \n 18  \nDuring the remainder of the summer sampling season, July through August, the water sampled \nin Stream 1 represented drainage through the unfrozen \u2018active layer\u2019 of tundra over a \ncatchment area of about 2 ha. The thermal development of the active layer at a site about 1 km \naway from Stream 1 has been described by Roth and Boike (2001). When air temperatures rise \nabove freezing the downward transfer of heat is greatly increased by the infiltration of water \nand water vapour derived from snowmelt. Thus, for their 1999 season, this warming resulted in \na temperature of 0oC being reached at the soil surface when the snowpack disappeared in mid-\nJune, 0oC at 0.5 m depth after 20 days; and 0oC at 1 m depth after a further 20 days (late July). \nThe depth of the active layer thereafter stabilised at about 1 m for a further 60 days before \nrapid freezing of the whole depth in late September (Roth and Boike, 2001).  \n \nAlthough the flow of the stream clearly responded to occasional summer precipitation (rain or \nsnow), this was a hydraulic response; no observations of overland flow after the mid-late June \nsnow-melt were recorded. Instead, the relative constancy in the chemical concentrations and \n\u03b42HH2O and \u03b418OH2O values of the stream suggests that the sampled waters always passed \nthrough the active layer. As the stream only represents the surface interception of the water \ntable, the measured flow of the stream (Figure 1) will always be an underestimate of the total \ndrainage rate from the catchment. The period of very low flow rates for Stream 1 during July to \nmid-August 2002, however, does correspond to a time when the waters had higher \u03b42HH2O and \n\u03b418OH2O values (Figure 3), and a relatively low \u03b42HH2O\/\u03b418OH2O slope of 6 (above). These \nfeatures are probably a result of slight evaporation (Clark and Fritz, 1997). \n \nThe main changes in chemistry through July and August appear to reflect two types of \nwater-mineral interaction: oxidation of reduced sulfur, leading to increases in the proportion of \nNSSS; and, more dominant, the solution of calcium-magnesium carbonates, leading to \nincreases in Ca and Mg balanced by HCO3-. The dominance of Ca and HCO3- in tundra \ndrainage and soil waters from NW Svalbard, as well as their general increase in concentration \n   \n 19  \nthrough the summer has been noted previously (Pecher, 1994; Hodson et al 2002; Stutter & \nBillett, 2003). Weathering of feldspars by reaction with dissolved CO2 is assumed to play only \na minor role in production of HCO3- in this catchment, because the concentrations of K and Na, \nmajor components of feldspar, were essentially unchanged from snow pack values. From the \nresults of the current study the mechanisms of these processes can be examined using isotope \nanalysis. \n \n4.2 Sulfur oxidation \nExtrapolation of the data in Figure 5 suggests that the NSSS had a \u03b434SSO4 value of about \n-2.1\u2030. Results of analyses of different rock types collected as pebbles from the gravel terraces \nof the catchment are shown in Table 6. Fragments of the Tertiary coal formerly mined at Ny \nAlesund are common, and had by far the highest S content (1580 ppm) with a \u03b434S value of \u2013\n0.9\u2030. As oxidation of reduced S (e.g. pyrite) to SO4: \n4FeS2 + 15O2 + 14H2O \u2192 4Fe(OH)3 + 8H2SO4     (1) \nusually involves very little change in \u03b434S values (Canfield, 2001), we would expect coal-\nderived sulfate to also have \u03b434S values close to \u20130.9\u2030. The isotopic fractionation associated \nwith crystallization of sulfate salts is also small (Raab and Spiro, 1991), so episodes of \nprecipitation and re-solution of gypsum attending dry or wet periods in the active layer \n(Cooper et al., 2002) should also result in little change in \u03b434S values. The \u03b434SSO4 data are \ntherefore entirely consistent with the oxidation of reduced sulfur in coal particles in the subsoil \nbeing the ultimate source of NSSS. \n \nThe factors which can influence the \u03b418O values for sulfate produced by Reaction 1 are more \ncomplex (van Everdingen and Krouse, 1985; Toran and Harris, 1989; Holt and Kumar, 1991; \nBottrell and Tranter, 2002). The SO42- oxygen atoms are derived from both atmospheric O2 and \nfrom water. The former has a \u03b418O value of about +23.5\u2030 (Kroopnick and Craig, 1977), and \n   \n 20  \nthe latter averaged about -9\u2030 for Stream 1 in both 2001 and 2002. This large difference means \nthat the \u03b418OSO4 value is very sensitive to the proportions of atmospheric O2 versus H2O used in \nthe oxidation reaction. Calculating these proportions is complicated by uncertainty in the \nmagnitude of the oxygen isotope fractionations accompanying incorporation of O2 oxygen or \nH2O oxygen (Holt and Kumar, 1991). However, using the criteria of Bottrell and Tranter \n(2002) for an average Stream 1 \u03b418OH2O value of -9\u2030, the \u03b418OSO4 value of -0.4\u2030 we have \ncalculated for the NSSS end-member sulfate would imply that atmospheric O2 supplied about \n40%, and water about 60% of the sulfate oxygen. This is consistent with the aerobic, oxidising \nconditions required for Reaction 1 (van Everdingen and Krouse, 1985; Bottrell and Tranter, \n2002). \n \n4.3 Carbonate solution \nThe sulfuric acid produced by the above oxidation of reduced sulfur has often been cited as \nhaving a significant influence on carbonate dissolution in glacial systems or other areas with \nhigh rates of water-rock interaction (Spence and Telmer, 2005): \n 8H2SO4 + 16CaCO3 \u2192 16Ca + 8SO42- + 16HCO3-   (2) \nThe amount of NSSS in Stream 1 waters, however, was relatively small compared with the \nbicarbonate concentrations. NSSS\/HCO3-, on an equivalents basis, ranged from 0.02 to 0.12, \nand for the average stream water composition the HCO3- produced by Equation 2 would only \naccount for 6% of the total HCO3-. Solution of CO2 from the atmosphere or from soil \nrespiration, and reaction with the resultant carbonic acid, must therefore represent the main \nmechanism for the solution of carbonate minerals. \n \nModelling the chemistry and \u03b413C values of TDIC requires assumptions to be made as to \nwhether the system is \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018closed\u2019 to the soil atmosphere. Since the active layer in the \ncatchment of Stream 1 is thought to average only 1 m at its deepest, and the humus layer and \nplant rooting depths are only a few cm, an \u2018open\u2019 system is assumed in which the TDIC freely \n   \n 21  \nexchanged with the soil atmosphere, and the soil atmosphere was a mixture of atmospheric \nCO2 and plant\/soil-respired CO2. The partial pressure of the total gaseous CO2, pCO2TOT, was \ncomputed from the water chemistry using the PHREEQC programme (Parkhurst, 1995). On \nthe basis that the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 is 360 ppm, the partial pressure due to \nsoil-respired CO2 was then calculated as: pCO2SOIL = pCO2TOT - 0.00036. For most of the \ndrainage season soil-respired CO2 was estimated to make up 40-60% of the total CO2; i.e. \nsoil-respired CO2 and atmospheric CO2 were present in roughly equal amounts. \n \nThe \u03b413C value of atmospheric CO2 is about -8\u2030. For soil-respired CO2 we assume a \u03b413C \nvalue of -23\u2030. This is based on the \u03b413C value for organic matter in the soil being -27\u2030 \n(Table 6), but increased by 4\u2030 to account for possible isotope fractionation due to diffusion \n(Cerling et al. 1991). From this the \u03b413C value of the total gaseous CO2 is: \n\u03b413CCO2TOT = [-23\u00b7(pCO2TOT -0.00036) \u20138\u00b7(0.00036)] \/ pCO2TOT   (3) \n \nUsing the carbon isotope fractionations between gaseous CO2 and dissolved carbon species \ngiven by Zhang et al. (1995), and the proportions of dissolved carbon species computed using \nPHREEQC, the CO2\u2013TDIC isotope fractionation can be calculated and, therefore, the value for \n\u03b413CTDIC (Figure 6). Skidmore et al. (2004) noted how kinetic, non-equilibrium isotope \nfractionation may have a marked effect on the \u03b413CTDIC values of fast-flowing glacial streams \nduring water-carbonate interaction over a few hours. However, as the slow flow rates of Stream \n1 suggest that the residence time of water in the catchment was at least several days, our \ncalculations assume isotope equilibrium. \n \nFigure 6 shows the \u03b413CTDIC values calculated for Stream 1 waters in 2002, compared with their \nmeasured values. Over much of the summer calculated and measured values were in qualitative \nagreement. However, there was a tendency for calculated values to be about 2\u2030 lower than \n   \n 22  \nmeasured value in the earlier part of the summer. This discrepancy suggests that the system \nwas not entirely open. Mineral carbonate in the gravels of Site 1 had a \u03b413C value of +2 to \n+3\u2030 (Table 6). Solution of this carbonate, under semi-closed conditions where there is not \ncomplete exchange with soil CO2, would raise the calculated \u03b413CTDIC values above those \nshown in Figure 5, toward closer agreement with the measured values. \n \nSimilar calculations for Stream 2 and Stream 3, assuming an open model system, again yield \ncalculated \u03b413CTDIC values similar to the measured values; typically agreeing to within \u00b1 2\u2030. \nIn contrast to the three streams in 2002, however, calculations for Stream 1 in 2001 yield \n\u03b413CTDIC values of -16 to -13\u2030, which are much lower than the measured values. This is a \nconsequence of the pH values measured for Stream 1 in 2001 being lower than those in 2002 \n(Table 2). This results in higher estimates for pCO2TOT using PHREEQC, and hence lower \ncalculated \u03b413CCO2TOT and \u03b413CTDIC for 2001. An error in pH measurements in 2001 might \nexplain this discrepancy, though we have no way of accounting for this error. \n \n4.4 Nitrogen \n4.4.1. Nitrate \n\u03b415N values for organic matter in soil near Stream 1 were +1 to +2\u2030 (Table 6). Since isotope \nfractionation during bacterial mineralisation and nitrification of organic matter in nutrient-poor \nsoils is generally thought to be small (Heaton, 1986; Kendall, 1998), similar values might be \nexpected for soil-derived NO3-. On this basis, the \u03b415N values of NO3- in Stream 1 waters of \n2002, typically -1 to +2\u2030 (Table 3), are what might be expected for soil-derived NO3-, but are \nquite different from the snowpack NO3- (c. -7\u2030) (Table 1). \n \nA distinction between soil-derived and atmospherically-derived (i.e. snowpack) NO3-, \nhowever, is more easily based on \u03b418O analysis (Amberger and Schmidt, 1987; Durka et al. \n   \n 23  \n1994; Kendall, 1998). On the theoretical assumption that nitrification derives two thirds of its \noxygen from H2O (average for Stream 1 = -9\u2030), and one third from atmospheric O2 (+23.5\u2030 \n(Kroopnick and Craig, 1972)), this would produce NO3- with \u03b418ONO3 = +2\u2030 for Site 1. In \ncontrast, the snowpack NO3- ranged from \u03b418ONO3 = +60 to +85\u2030 (Heaton et al. 2004). The \npure silver nitrate end-member for Stream 1 waters in Figure 7, having \u03b418ONO3 values of about \n-4 to +1\u2030, is therefore very similar to the value expected for NO3- derived entirely from \nnitrification. The linear trend of all Stream 1 samples in Figure 7 indeed suggests that \nthroughout the season the source of the stream NO3- was entirely of microbial origin, with no \nevidence of atmospheric, snowpack NO3-. Thus, whilst about 50 g NO3-N ha-1 is deposited in \nthe winter snowpack, with further deposition in summer precipitation, this NO3- was entirely \ntaken up into the soil bacterial nitrogen pool, and did not run off directly into the stream water. \n \nThe lack of evidence for snowpack NO3- in the Stream 1 waters is considered a result of the \nrelatively low NO3- inputs. The chemistry and \u03b434SSO4 values of the earliest stream waters \ncollected in both 2001 and 2002, which largely consisted of overland flow, had definite \nsnowpack characteristics. Therefore, it seems that the size of the input of snowpack NO3- to the \ntundra was small enough to allow the majority of it to be immobilised by assimilation into the \nplant \/ soil biomass. Plants and the microbial biomass can start to become active whilst still \nsnow covered, and recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of alpine and arctic tundra \nas sinks for inorganic N released from the snowpack (Bilbrough et al. 2000; Tye et al. 2005). \nTye et al. (2005) applied 15N-labelled inorganic NO3 and NH4 at the last stages of snowmelt to \ntundra close to Streams 1 and 3 of this study, and subsequently recovered about 60% of this \nnitrogen from the microbial biomass, bryophtyes and lichens, even though the applications of 1 \nand 5 kg N ha-1 greatly exceeded snowpack inputs. \n \n   \n 24  \nEarlier studies utilising \u03b418ONO3 analysis of silver nitrate samples prepared from high elevation \nor alpine tundra catchments have tended not to report sample purity, or consider how organic O \ncontaminants might affect interpetation (Burns and Kendall, 2002; Campbell et al. 2002; and \nSickman et al. 2003). Taken at face value, however, their conclusions differ slightly from those \nfor Stream 1, in that they do detect a component (< 50 %) of snowpack NO3- in stream waters \ndraining catchments after snowmelt. This may reflect differences in the soil\/plant biomass, \nand\/or in the relative amounts of snowpack N. Thus many of the previous studies were in \ncatchments with a large amount of bare rock, where biological modification of the snowmelt \nchemistry will be minimised. Sickman et al. (2003) found that ~20-30% of stream water NO3- \nin the first stages of snowmelt was from the snowpack, but this was for an area where the \namount of snowpack NO3-N was ~260 g ha-1, almost 5 times the inputs in this study. \nTherefore, in environments with less soil cover, or greater snow depths or NO3- concentrations \nthan those near Stream 1, saturation with respect to the NO3- assimilation abilities of the \nmicrobial and plant populations may occur during snow melt. \n \nHodson et al. (2002) reported an increase in NO3-\/Cl- ratios during mid-July in drainage \nthrough the developing active layer of moraine soils in a glacial forefield 4 km west of Ny \nAlesund. The increase in NO3- concentrations in samples from Stream 1 started in mid to late \nJuly and corresponded to a time of maximum active layer development and increased soil \ndryness when plants were becoming senescent. This increase could be explained by Sickman et \nal.\u2019s (2003) proposal that increased NO3- concentrations in alpine catchment streams were \nbrought about by continued mineralization\/nitrification by the soil microbial biomass at a time \nwhen plant demand for nitrogen uptake was being reduced through senescence. Such a \nmicrobial nitrification origin is clearly indicated for the unusually high NO3- concentrations for \nStream 1 on 20 July and 19 August 2002 (Table 2, Figure 6). In both cases the samples were \ntaken on days when rainfall occurred after a prolonged dry spell. The \u03b418ONO3 values close to \n0\u2030 rule out any contribution from atmospheric NO3-, and the lack of increased chloride \n   \n 25  \nconcentrations excludes evaporative enrichment as a cause of the high NO3-. The microbially-\nproduced NO3- had presumably been accumulating in the catchment soils until it was flushed \nout with the start of rainfall. \n \n4.4.2. Ammonium \nApart from a single early sample in 2001 (day 173), associated with heavy rainfall, NH4 \nconcentrations and NH4\/Cl- ratios remained constantly low (Fig. 2h). Unlike NO3-, there was \nno rise in NH4 towards the end of summer, and no flush-out of accumulated NH4 by rainfall \nfollowing dry periods. The isotopic characteristics of ammonium in geo-hydrological studies is \nmuch less well studied than nitrate, and the limited \u03b415N data for ammonium in Stream 1, six \nsamples from 2002 with values -7.2 to -0.7\u2030, can not be unambiguously interpreted. \nAmmonium produced by mineralisation in N-limited soils is thought to have, like nitrate, a \n\u03b415N value similar to that of the organic N (Kendall, 1998), and on this basis the \u03b415N values \nfor Stream 1 ammonium were much lower than that of the organic N (+1 to +2\u2030 in Table 6). \nIn addition, the Stream 1 sample \u03b415NNH4 values were also lower than that of the 2002 \nsnowpack (-0.3\u2030); though they are within the range for other snow samples (2001 snowpack, \nand individual snow events in Table 1) and within the published range for rainfall (Heaton et \nal. 1997). It is possible that some process of isotope fractionation has occurred, operating either \non soil-derived or atmospheric ammonium. \n \n4.4.3. Organic nitrogen \nConsideration of overall N budgets must include the role of dissolved organic nitrogen (Neff et \nal. 2003). No data are available for the snowpack at Site 1, but analyses of snow on nearby \nglaciers found that concentrations of DON were generally less than those of inorganic N \n(Hodson et al. 2005). In contrast, and in common with many low N systems, concentrations of \nDON in the stream generally exceeded those for total inorganic N (Table 2b). A strong \ncorrelation between DOC and DON (r2= 0.92) in Stream 1, together with the relatively high \n   \n 26  \nDOC\/DON ratios (Table 2b), suggest that much of this DON may have derived from humic \nsubstances in soil organic matter. These features accord with studies showing that DON of \npredominantly soil humic origin is the main form of N loss via rivers draining the Arctic tundra \n(Dittmar et al. 2001; Kawahigashi et al. 2004). \n \nPerakis & Hedin (2002) suggested that in ecosystems with low N inputs, inorganic N is largely \nretained within the ecosystem, whereas less biologically-available forms of DON may \ndominate in stream waters. Thus N-limited ecosystems with a high biotic demand for N may \nnevertheless lose DON. The forms of DON lost will tend to be the more complex organic \ncomponents resistant to biochemical breakdown, and the factors controlling their loss may be \nless subject to biotic influences (mineralization or biotic uptake) than factors controlling \ninorganic N. Instead, DON concentrations in streams may be more closely linked to factors \ninfluencing the organic retentivity of soil mineralogy \u2013 sandy soils such as those at Site 1 being \nless retentive - and hydrological parameters (Hedin et al. 1995; Neff et al. 2003). These factors \nmay explain the relative constancy of the DON\/Cl ratio in Stream 1 throughout the season, and \nthe similar response of both NO3- and DON concentrations to significant rainfall events where \na positive correlation in molar concentration of NO3- and DON was found (r2=0.78). However, \nwhereas the ratio of DON\/Cl- remained relatively constant through the summer, the NO3\/Cl- \nratio clearly increased towards the end of the season. \n \n5. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS \nResults from this study have increased understanding of the mechanisms involved in \nweathering reactions and nitrogen release in thin organic soils overlying sediment in tundra. In \nparticular, the stable isotope analyses provide insights into how biogeochemical and \nweathering processes may evolve with climate change and the expected increases in the depth \nof the active layer (Anisimov et al. 1997). Snowpack on a near-shore site in the High Arctic \nhas a major element composition dominated by seawater. This seawater chemistry is evident in \n   \n 27  \nthe earliest stream waters draining the tundra at the onset of snowmelt, but is gradually \nmodified by weathering reactions. The main chemical change is associated with solution of \nCa-Mg carbonate. The \u03b413C values of the resulting bicarbonate in the streams are unusually \nhigh, and are presumed to reflect the particular characteristics of these tundra soils. Thus in \nparts of the globe where soils are deeper and better developed, \u2018closed system\u2019 carbonate \nsolution dominated by plant\/soil-respired CO2 is common. In contrast, the chemistry and \n13C\/12C ratios of three streams sampled near Ny-\u00c5lesund in 2002 can be accounted for by a \nlargely \u2018open system\u2019 model in which the CO2 is derived about equally from atmospheric and \nplant\/soil sources. As these sources of CO2 are essentially restricted to a very thin plant\/soil \ncover in the top few centimetres of the active layer, the progressive deepening of the active \nlayer as the permafrost melts during the summer will probably not promote any increase in \ncarbonate solution. This may account for the fact that the Ca-Mg-HCO3- concentrations in the \nstream waters are established early in the season, and display only limited increases in the later \npart of summer. Increases in the depth of the active zone predicted with climate change will \nresult in new mineral surfaces and easily soluble minerals being exposed (Keller et al., 2007). \nHowever, results from this study suggest that the weathering of carbonates in the deepening \nactive zone through solution of CO2 from atmospheric or biological sources may be limited by \nits diffusion as demonstrated with the \u2018open system\u2019 model.   \n \nIn glacial systems the solution of carbonate by CO2 is limited by the relative scarcity of \nbiogenic sources of CO2, and restricted access of atmospheric CO2 to the water-saturated bed \nof a glacier. Sulphide oxidation may therefore be a major contributor to carbonate solution in \nglacially-derived streams (Tranter et al. 2002). Although its role in the non-glacial streams of \nthis study appears to be less important, sulphide oxidation nevertheless represents the second \nmajor weathering reaction whose understanding benefits from isotope data. The \u03b434S values of \nthe stream water sulfate follow a clear two end-member mixing pattern: a seawater sulfate \ncomponent dominant in the earliest part of the summer drainage, with sulfate derived from \n   \n 28  \noxidation of reduced sulfur in coal being progressively added through the rest of the summer. \nIf the fragments of coal are uniformly distributed through the subsoil, as might be expected in \nglacialy-derived gravels, more coal will be exposed to sulfur oxidation as the active layer \ndeepens. This may explain why SO42-\/Cl- ratios, unlike HCO3-\/Cl- ratios, rise progressively \nthrough the summer drainage. The \u03b418O values of the sulfate are consistent with the oxidation \nbeing entirely aerobic, which would be expected given the easy exchange of the atmosphere \nwith a shallow active layer. This is in contrast to the formation processes ascribed to sulfate in \nglacial runoff, where \u03b418O data have been used to suggest that sulphide oxidation at the bed of \na glacier, cut off from the atmosphere, is at least partially anaerobic (Bottrell and Tranter, \n2002; Wynn et al. 2006). Thus, with increases in the depth of the active layer expected with \nincreasing temperatures, the distribution and weathering of newly exposed sulphide minerals in \nthe sediment underlying the thin soils may play an important role in the production of acidity \nrequired for carbonate solution and may be a mechanism that increases losses of Ca-Mg-HCO3 \nand SO42- to surface waters.  \n \nIn contrast to other studied alpine and arctic catchments, the isotope composition (\u03b415N and \n\u03b418O values) of NO3- in drainage waters in this study suggests that none of it is derived directly \nfrom atmospheric NO3-. Possibly because of the low NO3- input, and the existence of a \ncontinuous (if thin) soil cover, the snowpack NO3- was assimilated and re-mineralised before \nbeing released into the stream. The export of this soil-derived NO3- increased during the latter \npart of summer as plant senescence progressed and ecosystem demand for NO3- diminished. \nResults have demonstrated that there are increased losses of NO3- derived through microbial \nactivity from early to mid August. Warmer temperatures would be expected to extend the \nlength of time each summer in which high microbial activity is present. It will also produce a \nshorter frozen period when drainage waters would not be present. This would be expected to \nincrease NO3- losses. However, the extent of NO3- losses in drainage waters may be a balance \n   \n 29  \nbetween microbial activity and the effect of warming on senescence in tundra plants. For \nexample, Marchard et al. (2004) suggested that climate warming may extend the growing \nseason and postpone senescence in plants of the High Arctic, contrary to previous research \nsuggesting that late season phenology is solely controlled by photoperiod. No seasonal change \nwas evident in dissolved organic nitrogen, the other major form of N loss to drainage. This \nmight be a consequence of the DON being largely unreactive, with its concentrations mainly \nsubject to abiological controls. However, increases in microbial activity and the length of the \ndrainage period as a result of increasing temperatures will increase the overall losses of organic \nC and N species in drainage waters to aquatic ecosystems.   \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for \nfunding this work through the GANE programme (grant GST\/02\/2725).

Bars signify the propagated error associated with the analytical precision \nof the ion and chloride measurements. Where bars are absent the error is less than the symbol \nsize. \n \nFigure 4. \u03b418OH2O values of Stream 1 during 2001 (\u25cf) and 2002 (\u25a1).
