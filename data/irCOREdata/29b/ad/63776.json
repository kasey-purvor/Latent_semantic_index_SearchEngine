It reflects \na personal, not a corporate, viewpoint. \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 1\n1 THE OPPORTUNITY \n \nRecent advances in geoinformatics suggest that it is timely to review the system for \nhandling information and knowledge. Many of those involved in geoscience surveying \nmay question the need for further change. This paper attempts an answer, directed at \ngeoscientists, by indicating some possible directions and expected benefits. \nThe acceptance of the concept of the Digital Geoscience Spatial Model (DGSM) as an \napproach to geological survey (Smith, 2001), and the deployment of the Semantic Grid as \ninfrastructure for e-science, combine to offer an unusual opportunity, namely, to \ntransform part of the geoscience knowledge system. The work and proposals recorded at \nthe GEON website on cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences (GEON, 2004a, b) indicate \nthe radical changes envisaged for the broader field of geoscience. The ultimate aim for a \nGeological Survey knowledge system may be to meet user requirements and \nexpectations, but the results will be more effective if they emerge from careful \nconsideration of the subject matter. A successful outcome therefore depends on \ngeological input at scientific, technical and management levels. Some potential benefits \nto geoscience survey are reviewed in section 2, some underlying concepts in section 3, \nand prospects for extending the vision of future geoscience survey in section 4, with \nconclusions in section 5.  \nThe Grid  \nThe revolutionary impact of information technology on society (like the railway, road, \nelectricity grid, or telephone system before it) may occur when it ceases to comprise \ndifferentiated, proprietary technologies and becomes a ubiquitous infrastructure shared by \nall: a commodity, no longer offering a strategic advantage over competitors, but a cost to \nbe managed like office supplies. This is seen as a likely consequence of the current \nevolution of the Internet into a new infrastructure of information and communications \ntechnology referred to as the cyberinfrastructure or Grid (Foster and Kesselman, 2003). \nThe Report of the [US] National Science Foundation Advisory Panel on \nCyberinfrastructure states in its summary (Atkins et al., 2003, page 81): \u2018The scope and \nscale of the ACP [Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Project] will require an annual budget of \nabout $1 billion over and above the current PACI and infrastructure programs in NSF\u2026 \nNevertheless, our recommendations should be considered as only a beginning.\u2019 \nGeoscientists are involved, for example through the GEON project \u2013 a prototype national \nGeosciences Cyberinfrastructure Network. An aim of GEON is helping to weave the \nseparate strands of the solid Earth sciences disciplines and data into a unified fabric. \nInitiatives elsewhere include European Commission funding, which supports the EGEE \nproject (Enabling Grids for E-science in Europe), a two-year project of a four-year \nprogram, with links to government initiatives and funding (EGEE, 2004; e-Science \nInstitute, 2004; UK Research Councils, 2004).  \nThe Grid is bringing a large increase in the capacity and power of computer networks, \nthus allowing more ideas to be expressed, shared, and structured to extend human \nknowledge. It aims to provide facilities that, among other things, enable scientists to \ngenerate, analyze, share, discuss and communicate their investigations in a more effective \nmanner. Hinke (2004) describes how Grid services \u2018could revolutionize the ability of \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 2\ndevelopers to easily construct extensible data handling and processing systems, by \nproviding seamless access to various types of resources including computational \nresources, data archives, scientific sensors and the services to process data into some \ndesired product, which itself could be formulated as a service.\u2019 The Grid might, for \nexample, change the emphasis in a Geological Survey\u2019s objectives, from delivering \npublished end products, to maintaining information resources from which end users could \nselect services that would respond more flexibly to their specific needs. \nThe DGSM  \nGeoscience surveying operates at the interface of the solid Earth and geological \nknowledge, linking them through spatial location. It thus has important roles in collecting \ninformation and testing interpretations. The Digital Geoscience Spatial Model extends \nbeyond conventional map-based survey. The model overcomes constraints of the map, \nsuch as its static two dimensions, fixed scale, inflexible information density, limited \ntopics, rigid sheet boundaries, separation of spatial depiction from text explanation, and \nlaborious and time-consuming drafting and revision procedures.  \nThe model can take a flexible view of the geology as a set of interrelated things of \ninterest (objects), which exhibit attributes such as properties, behavior and relationships. \nIts structure accepts classifications by distinguishing between object classes and instances \n(described in section 3) and recognizing class hierarchies (as in stratigraphy) within \nwhich attributes can be inherited. Potentially, it can relate observed objects to, say, the \noutcome of simulated processes, and track reasoning processes from observation to \nexplanation or vice versa (Voisard, 1999). Being scale-free, the model can accommodate \nmulti-scalar concepts like fractal representations. Objects described in mark-up \nlanguages, such as XML, can combine text, data and images readable by human beings \nwith tags readable by computer, and thereby connect their respective strengths. The \nresults of a DGSM can be stored and maintained in a hypermedia knowledge repository \nor object store, where the semantic web records relationships and reasoning. \nThe Semantic Web  \nExtensions to the Web aim to provide a language expressing both information and rules \nfor reasoning about it (including rules in existing knowledge-representation systems), \nenabling people and computers to work in closer cooperation (CEOS, 2004). Sharing and \nprocessing information by automated tools as well as by people should lead to more \neffective discovery, integration and reuse of the information (Gahegan and Brodaric, \n2002). The Extensible Markup Language (XML) allows users to extend their documents \nby embedding structures in them that computers can interpret (W3C, 2004; Cox, 2004; \nPOSC, 2004). The Resource Description Framework (RDF) gives form to such a \nstructure, as a triple of three linked items, like a sentence expressing the idea that an \nobject has an attribute with a value. A Universal Resource Identifier (URI) can identify \neach of the three items, thus linking them to unique definitions available on the Web. The \nvalue can be another object, and the RDF statement can itself be regarded as an object or \nattribute.  \nThere is thus scope to record, as part of an object\u2019s description or at the appropriate \npoints in a document, inference rules that: define object behavior (its response to types of \nprocess), such as a class of surfaces being appropriately modeled in a specific way; \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 3\nrelationships, such as that the W, X and Y formations lie in a conformable sequence in \nthe south but the W lies unconformably on the Y in the north; and reasoning, such as \nlinking the form of a surface model to that of process simulations and thence drawing \nconclusions about its origin. A URI can point to anything, including a physical object, \nthus bridging the interface from the virtual to the real world.  \nOntologies also play a part in the Semantic Web, each a published specification of a \nconceptual framework for a particular topic (NASA, 2004; W3C, 2004). They typically \nprovide taxonomies that define classes of objects, the relationships between them, and \nsets of inference rules. They aim to be consistent and unambiguous and to integrate \ndiverse viewpoints, facilitating sharing of content and services. \u2018Human endeavor is \ncaught in an eternal tension between the effectiveness of small groups acting \nindependently and the need to mesh with the wider community... An essential process is \nthe joining together of subcultures when a wider common language is needed\u2026 The \nSemantic Web, in naming every concept simply by a URI, lets anyone express new \nconcepts that they invent with minimal effort. Its unifying logical language will enable \nthese concepts to be progressively linked into a universal Web.\u2019 (Berners-Lee et al., \n2001) \nThe Semantic Grid  \nThe Semantic Grid brings together the ideas of the Semantic Web and the Grid. It \nsupports the vision of e-science, helping scientists to work and collaborate more \neffectively by providing a language that expresses both data and rules for reasoning about \nthe data. \u2018Our vision is of a generically useable e-science infrastructure, comprised of \neasily deployed components whose utility transcends their immediate application, \nproviding a high degree of easy-to-use and seamless automation and in which there are \nflexible collaborations and computations on a global scale. The key to this is an \ninfrastructure where all resources, including services, are adequately described in a form \nthat is machine-processable, i.e. knowledge is explicit - in other words, the infrastructure \nprovided by the technologies of the Semantic Web. The goal is semantic interoperability.\u2019 \n(De Roure, 2003).  \nThe Semantic Grid adopts a service-oriented view (De Roure et al., 2001) \u2018based upon \nthe notion of various entities providing services to one another under various forms of \ncontract (or service level agreements).\u2019 Numerous software systems or agents that \nperform useful tasks on behalf of a user would interact in this setting. A service provider, \nsuch as a Geological Survey, would therefore have to ensure long-term digital \npreservation of trusted sources of evaluated, up-to-date knowledge (PADI, 2004). In due \ncourse, individuals and organizations must evolve to meet their changing roles within a \nmore comprehensive and flexible system supporting the repository of scientific \nknowledge. For Geological Surveys, there is an opportunity to gain many benefits, \nmentioned next, provided essential features of the present system are not neglected. \n \n \n \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 4\n \n2 THE BENEFITS \n \nWorldwide, the work of Geological Surveys converges on geoscience maps and their \naccompanying explanations.  These conventional products follow consistent standards \nand give extensive coverage at several fixed scales. The large format and high resolution \nof the maps enable users to focus on points of specific interest within a context supplied \nby peripheral vision. They generally correlate with topographic and other related maps. \nThey are robust, highly portable, and can be used without supporting technology. They \nare assembled with care and consistent quality control. The maps are typically \nsupplemented by text explanations that provide an illustrated background account of the \ngeology of the area as a whole and of salient details, illustrated where appropriate by \ndetailed maps and diagrams. Because they are formal publications, they provide a fixed \nreference point for geoscientists. They are widely available at reasonable cost, and copies \nare held indefinitely in several secure libraries. Revised versions are published when \nappropriate, generally after many years. The qualities of these conventional publications \nmake it unlikely that they will be supplanted in the foreseeable future. But the end \nproducts constrain the approach and procedures of investigation. \nInformation technology (IT) has a growing role in the processes of geoscience surveying \nand in the preparation of maps and associated documents. Digital cartography can make \nthe legacy of old documents available in new forms, which subject experts can enhance \nfor inclusion in a system of digital spatial models. Field mapping can generate digital \nrecords directly. Modern information and communications technology introduces models \nthat may lead to more effective methods of surveying and presentation. Adherence to \nstandards makes it easier to find and exchange information (FGDC, 2004; USGS, 2004a, \nb). New systems can offer many benefits, but require careful design to retain existing \nvaluable qualities, and to ensure that they tie in with related systems of wider scope \n(Brodaric, 2000).  \nAn IT-based system can model spatial and other aspects of geological knowledge, \nincluding concepts and objects, their properties, relationships and processes. Anticipated \nlong-term gains for users of such a geoscience knowledge system include the following: \nCosts  \nThe costs of preparing, storing, finding and using conventional documents are opaque, \nmaking cost comparisons difficult. However, at each stage the corresponding long-term \ncosts of an IT system appear highly competitive, with more transparent costing leading to \nmore efficient procedures.  \nFlexible structure  \nMaps have fixed scales, rigid content, and sheet boundaries unconnected to the \nsignificance and extent of geological objects. Digital spatial models can be seamless with \nno artificial boundaries of area, detail or subject matter. Unlike maps, models can handle \ncomplex systems and multi-scalar views of the geology, as in the self-similar dissipative-\nsystem models of sand bodies (van Wagoner et al., 2003). \n \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 5\nTimeliness  \nConventional publication is slow, and decades may elapse between data collection and \npublication. Much information is now collected digitally, and could be made instantly \navailable, with access controlled by authorization procedures rather than by the \nmechanics and economics of printing and publishing. \nEase of access  \nDiscovering and accessing relevant information from conventional sources is slow and \nlaborious, particularly for users lacking the facilities of a major Survey. Web access, on \nthe other hand, can be made available anywhere. Web search engines, metadata and \nbrowsers help the user to discover, filter and retrieve spatial and related information from \nmany sources. \nConnected information  \nInformation from a single investigation is inconveniently segregated by form of \npresentation, such as: maps; memoirs; journal articles; textbooks; databases; archives of \nfield records, samples and specimens; photographs; sketches; preliminary results; human \nknowledge. Multimedia and mark-up languages can link and combine information types \nat any level of detail. \nFlexible presentation  \nMultimedia records can be filtered for relevance and assembled and presented to meet a \nwide range of purposes and contexts. For example, a map of a rock body could be shown \non screen alongside text accounts of the processes of its formation and photographs of its \noutcrop, with options for, say, superimposing fitted diagrams of its origin and \ndevelopment, or displaying the consequences of cut-and-fill for road building. \nFlexible visualization  \nThe map is a single, rigid visualization. Spatial models provide information that can be \nvisualized as maps, sections, fence diagrams, block diagrams, video sequences, \ncorrelation diagrams and so on, for user-selected areas, content, scales and projections. \nThematic maps and multiple visualizations can overcome the information overload of the \nsingle map, clarifying the interpretation. \nFormal structure  \nThe object-oriented model separates metadata from detail, distinguishes between object \nclasses and instances, and creates object-class hierarchies with multiple inheritance of \nattributes and behavior. It conforms well to patterns of geological thought and provides a \nclear framework for uniform standards on what to call things, what they mean, how they \nrelate, where to put them and where to find them. \nReusing objects  \nBy routinely identifying the properties and behavior of object classes, it should be \npossible to reuse object instances, such as the boundary of a rock body, for various \npurposes, such as thematic studies for land use, geological risk assessment, resource \nestimation, and other products custom-built for specific user needs. The Web and, in due \ncourse, the Grid will enable experts in any field to assemble objects and software from \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 6\ndiverse sources, and record their methods in scripts that in turn may be reused in other \ncontexts. \nReasoning  \nObject-oriented methods can link field evidence and conclusions to an ontology (for \nconsistent terminology) and to objects describing aspects of theory and specific chains of \nreasoning. These could provide the evidence justifying the conclusions, help to evaluate \nthe findings, and identify the wider consequences of new observations or ideas.  \nIntegration  \nThe interpretation depends on many aspects of geological reasoning, such as depositional, \nstructural, and metamorphic models, which may have to be considered together to explain \neven a small feature. The rich connections within and among hypertext records can help \nto clarify links between the separate lines of reasoning at any level of detail. \nReconciling viewpoints  \nObject oriented techniques should enable information from many sources to be \ncombined. Multiple sources reduce uncertainty, and narrow the range of plausible \nhypotheses. But the original sources may have adopted viewpoints with different \nobjectives and emphasis, leading to conflicting results. Reconciling them requires the \njudgment of human experts, and the computer can record their reasons and justification.  \nThe motives for transforming the information systems of Geological Surveys are to \nsupport better science more efficiently. Survey records could be connected in more detail \nwith the historical configurations of geological objects and processes and their underlying \nphysics, chemistry and biology, while positioning geoscience appropriately in the \nmainstream of development of the larger, unbounded knowledge system. It is subject \nspecialists (not computers) that have the background understanding of geoscience and of \ntheir own ways of thinking that enabled them to build the existing knowledge system. \nThey are best placed to reorganize that system by formalizing a framework within which \nIT can help users to record, store, find, relate, select, assemble, communicate and \nvisualize their knowledge. Deploying these mechanical aids effectively calls for some \nunaccustomed introversion by geoscientists about their working practices and the \nconsequences of change made possible by the emerging methods of IT. \n \n3 ASPECTS OF THE GEOSCIENCE KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM \n \nTwo streams of IT development contribute to the potential benefits listed in section 2. \nThe first is knowledge representation (Sowa, 2000), including abstraction and modeling; \nthe second is communication, and its infrastructure of Internet and Web-based \ntechnologies. The two streams converge in the hypermedia repositories and knowledge \nsystems supported by the Semantic Web and Grid. It may be useful here to clarify some \nterms, and to highlight some approaches and suggest how they fit together. Their \ncombined relevance in an integrated system for geological surveying remains largely \nunexplored. \n \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 7\nStandards  \nInternational standards extend the ability to communicate within a comprehensive \nknowledge system. Various information communities (such as CGI, 2004; ISO, 2004; \nOGC, 2004; POSC, 2004; W3C, 2004) are concerned with procedures and standards in \nspecific areas, including easier access to information (GILS, 2004; INSPIRE, 2004; \nNational Geological Surveys Committee, 2004).  \nSystems  \nA system is a collection of elements or components that are organized for a common \npurpose. System boundaries are somewhat arbitrary, but the systems approach brings \ntogether widely used concepts, vocabulary and insights from many fields of study. The \nsystem of geological surveying observes and measures features of the real world. Its \nprocedures represent, record, interpret, explain and communicate the results, extending \nthe system of scientific knowledge with conclusions that can be tested against reality. \nAbstraction  \nThe system that makes scientific knowledge comprehensible to the human mind requires \na process of abstraction; that is, reducing the volume of information while retaining \nsalient features and relationships. Geoscience surveying progressively reduces the full \ndetail of the real world to observations, then to field records, then (by a process of \ninterpretation, reasoning and explanation) to general conclusions drawn from specific \ninstances, and summarization and generalization. It aims (by feedback from higher levels \nto detailed levels of abstraction) to extend or modify a shared paradigm of a \nparsimonious, unified account of the observed phenomena. \nReconciliation  \nThe paradigm is shared at a general level, but detail may be specific to the investigation. \nThe objectives, methods and opinions of the investigators determine which features are \nregarded as salient, and influence how the abstraction proceeds. Using information from \none study in another context therefore requires filtering and adjustment, usually under \nhuman control, to reconcile information from one investigation with that of another, for \nthe purposes in hand (Kent, 1978, Sowa, 2000, chapter 6). \nModels  \nA model is an approximate representation, for a specific purpose, of some limited aspects \nof the real or imagined world. It aims to reduce their inconceivable complexity to a \nmanageable representation. Hierarchical models can represent phenomena at several \nlevels of complexity or detail. Geoscience survey models interface (through spatial \ncoordinates) with the real world, where observations are made and deductions tested. \nObject-oriented analysis  \nThe computer-based system should work in harmony with human thought patterns. \nObject-oriented analysis (Budd, 2000, Coad and Yourdon, 1991) aims to build on the \nmethods commonly used to organize our observations of the real world. It differentiates \nthe observed world into things of interest (objects) and their attributes and relationships; \ndistinguishes between the whole object and its component parts; groups individual \noccurrences (instances) of objects into classes with shared properties and behavior; and \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 8\nprovides for hierarchies of classes and inheritance of properties within them. The objects \ncan potentially be reused in various applications. Object-oriented design and \nimplementation (Brodaric and Hastings, 2002), as opposed to analysis, raise many issues \nnot considered here. \nSpatial models  \nGeoscience spatial models aim to represent the spatial properties and relationships of \ngeoscience objects within a consistent mathematical framework (Mallet, 2002). The \nbehavior of the objects can be defined, relating them to reasoning from process models, \nand tying the interpretation to database management systems and geographic information \nsystems (to discover, filter and retrieve relevant information from the object store), \ninterpolation systems (for filling gaps and estimating uncertainty), and visualization \nsystems (to display the results). \nThe general geoscience spatial model  \nThe observations and interpretations of geoscience are linked to a more general \nconceptual model. This refers at all levels of detail to the three-dimensional disposition \nand configuration (where things are and where they are arranged) of the present-day \nobservable and conceptual objects of geoscience, to their observed and interpreted \nproperties and composition, and also to their history throughout geological time, \nincluding the processes that created or transformed them and are crucial to their \ninterpretation. It is too vast and inaccessible for full representation, and so remains an \nabstract concept. But it provides the essential conceptual framework for relating and \nreconciling various facets of its fragmentary representation. \nThe challenge  \nThe multiplicity of views in geoscience might be reflected in the infrastructure by a \nvariety of big and little ontologies, with working connections established through \nlinkages, in a system that encourages their rationalization, and reconciliation for specific \npurposes, in response to real user needs. The interests and viewpoints of the end users of \ngeoscience knowledge differ from (and may be unknown to) the collectors of the \ninformation, and the ultimate users of geological knowledge are not generally geologists. \nThe future infrastructure will develop to offer links to all areas of general and scientific \nknowledge. There is a need for geoscientists and their information communities to adapt \ntheir knowledge system to a new infrastructure devised by others, and to keep pace with \nchanging user needs.  \nThis points to the need for planning ahead to meet the challenges of geoinformatics. \nPortals, browsers, selection, interpolation, and visualization systems will be subsumed in \nthe infrastructure and accessed through agents (programs that act in a self-interested \nmanner on behalf of their users, while interacting with many other agents in the computer \nnetwork). Collecting, finding and using geological information will be undertaken in a \nmultitude of different contexts, not just on the terms set by one cohesive geoscience \ninformation community. The challenge is therefore, not to prejudge the end result, but to \ninfluence and participate in the development and exploitation of an infrastructure that can \noffer the mechanisms for diversity, evaluation, selection and inheritance that are required \nfor the beneficial evolution of knowledge. \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 9\nThe infrastructure offers no competitive advantage from selective ownership of new \ntechnology. On the contrary, as with purchasers of a camera-phone, the utility of each \nowner\u2019s investment increases as the standard technology is more widely adopted. Early \nadopters might benefit by subsidy from bodies anxious to maintain a country or region\u2019s \nlong-term competitive position. But the main advantages of an organization\u2019s early \ninvolvement lie in gaining time to evaluate the scenarios, analyze the processes within the \norganization, determine priorities, and achieve a smooth adjustment to the developing \nknowledge system without unnecessary disruption to staff and customers.  \nFor example, the British Geological Survey (2004) currently provides a portal and \nbrowser for access to its information. But, in the outside world, enquirers dealing with, \nsay, epidemiology or insurance risks might overlook the possibility that the portal, or \nindeed geology, could be relevant. In the longer run, customers may wish to access \ngeoscience information through a general search engine, where it could be integrated with \ninformation from other sources, rather than through an entry point specific to one \norganization. If so, a flexible plan for transition is required some years in advance. Time \nis essential to plan ahead, explore alternatives and gain experience in unfamiliar fields, \nsuch as establishing trusted, service-oriented, digital systems. \nLong-term adjustments may need immediate attention, such as reviewing the structure \nand boundaries of organizations and information communities, establishing tentative \npathfinder standards, defining areas of priority research, and reconsidering field methods, \nstaff training and balance of staff expertise. Decisions may also be required on the \nassignment and fulfillment of long-term responsibilities, such as digital preservation and \nmaintenance (PADI, 2004, Fedora, 2004) and procedures for rationalizing geoscience \nontologies, maintained in the light of the current general geoscience model. \n \n4 EXTENDING THE VISION \n \nThe vision of IT in geoscience survey is still being adjusted to the concepts of database, \ncomputer aided design, geographic information systems, spatial models, object-oriented \nanalysis, the Internet and the Web. Projects based on these concepts have evolved step by \nstep, and are now incorporated in the procedures of many geological surveys, although \nnot yet bringing the full benefits listed in section 2. Maps can be scanned, stored and \nreproduced; geological features can be vectorized and described in a database; map sheets \ncan be edge matched; GIS-based spatial indexes can record and retrieve a wide range of \nspatial features; metadata can be standardized for geoscience records; spatial models can \nrecord and visualize the three-dimensional form of geological features; object-oriented \nmethods help to rationalize the design; digital field recording integrates the system with \nelectronic surveying tools, the Global Positioning System and (potentially) augmented \nreality; the Web can select and deliver the results. Not only is a vision defined, but also \nmany parts of the system are implemented and doing useful work. Many standards, such \nas those referred to in section 3, are already in place. They give a firm base for planning \nthe next steps. \nThere is now a clear need for extending this vision to match the developments in the \ncyberinfrastructure. For example, a seamless geological map should allow the user to \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 10\nspecify the required area, type of content, scale, projection, and format. But simply edge-\nmatching existing sheets will not meet these needs. Map explanations and marginalia, \nsuch as stratigraphic tables, cross-sections, and generalized vertical sections, prove \ndifficult to keep in step with depiction of the map face for an arbitrary area.  \nThe underlying problem is that the map is a static two-dimensional projection of \nincomplete fragments of the general geoscience model mentioned in section 3. The \nsurveying process organizes the fragmentary information by long-standing procedures \ndesigned for paper documents. They hold back the introduction of user map design and \nother concepts, such as georeasoning (Gahegan and Brodaric, 2002, Pshenichny, 2003), \nor a view of Earth processes sharing the common physics of complex dissipative systems \n(van Wagoner et al., 2003). The problem cannot be resolved by technical advance alone: \nideas are shaped by the manner of their representation, and geoscientists must be \ninvolved. \nLinking models of spatial objects to an account of the reasoning process is desirable for at \nleast three reasons. First, the surveying model must include evidence and reasoning to \nfulfill its role as the interface connecting geoscience knowledge and the real solid Earth. \nSecond, all scientists should be able to explain their procedures, so that colleagues can \nfollow their reasoning, evaluate and test their results. Third, the links are needed to \nestablish how the knowledge base must be amended to respond to the inevitable revision \nof interpretations and observations. Taken together, these issues suggest that the vision of \nfuture geoscience surveying may be too narrowly focused on extending the geoscience \nmap as a spatial model, and that the underlying rationale needs reconsideration. The \nhuman brain appears to handle spatial and narrative information along different pathways \n(Loudon, 2000, parts J, K). The separation reappears in geoscience survey in the \ndistinction between maps or spatial models on the one hand, and text-based narrative \nexplanations on the other.  \nSpace has special properties, reflected in methods (topology, geometry and spatial \ntransformations) for describing spatial pattern and relationships. Spatial thinking takes a \ncomprehensive three-dimensional view, perhaps considering geological time as \nanalogous (in some respects) to a fourth spatial dimension. \u2018We can zoom in to see the \ndetail, zoom out to see the spatial context, pan around to see the situation elsewhere, and \ncompare spatial patterns arising from different topics. Narrative text cannot offer these \nabilities, but can be intimately linked to a spatial representation\u2019 (Loudon, 2000, page \nA89). \nInformation in narrative form may refer to sequences of events, reasoning and \nexplanations. In a similar way, narrative may describe properties by sequences of words \nand sentences, perhaps enumerating the characteristics of a rock, and proceeding from \ngeneral comments to detail. In our memories and in written text or the spoken word, the \nnarrative follows threads of thought, linked and woven together to make sense of our \nexperience by defining objects and processes, drawing analogies, establishing \nrelationships, abstracting and summarizing.  \nMarkup languages enable surveyors to organize their ideas as a set of narrative accounts \n(objects), trace the threads of reasoning through hypertext links between the objects, and \nlink the objects with their counterparts in a digital spatial model. All are potentially tied \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 11\nto a shared ontology through interactive templates, and developed together in the field \nand office. Spatial representations, such as the geological map or spatial model, fill the \nspace depicted, resorting to interpolation, approximation and generalization where direct \nknowledge is inadequate. The spatial coordinates provide additional GIS links to, for \nexample, stratigraphic metadata, cross-sections, databases and explanatory text objects.  \nThe knowledge base cannot record the full general geoscience spatial model, which \nremains only as a concept. However, the overall structure and features of geoscience and \nits general model are described in many textbooks, and implied in bibliographic databases \nsuch as Georef (AGI, 2004) and metadata such as the Epicentre model (see POSC, 2004, \n\u2018Specifications\u2019). They provide the framework, classes and categories for the indexing \nand cataloguing of geoscience information. \nThe same framework guides the surveyors and the users of the completed survey. Within \nsuch a framework, the user should be able to search among the diverse incomplete \nfragments of the general model, select the most relevant, and visualize them as filtered \nextracts, possibly requiring reconciliation by the user. The user\u2019s agent might apply filters \nto select from such aspects as: the area of interest; the business setting; the range of topics \nand levels of detail in each object hierarchy; the user\u2019s objectives and the emphasis \nplaced on particular properties; the sources and evaluation of the information; the levels \nof resolution and generalization that match the scale of visualization; the levels of \nconfidence, ranging from confirmed observation to tentative explanation; the spatial \nrelationships valid at the selected levels; the appropriate spatial properties, such as \nexistence, location, slope, form, texture, arrangement, relationships; the place of the \nobjects and properties in chains of reasoning and process-response models. Visualization \nof the filtered extracts would then involve geometrical transformations including \nprojection. \nThe ontology for the digital Geological Survey model is a component of this more \ngeneral framework. The model might be thought of as representing a self-consistent, \napproved and authorized interpretation and explanation of the disposition and \nconfiguration of the rock units and aspects of their properties, composition, relationships \nand history, within a defined area or volume. The internal consistency of the model \nreduces the need for users to reconcile fragments. The model should enable users to view \nsurveying as a process, not just as a product. It must be flexible to accommodate the \nvariety of routes that surveying procedures can follow, and the levels of detail to which \nthey refer. For example, the framework must be able to accept as input, not just \nmultimedia streams of marked-up field notes and spatial models, but also existing \nvisualizations (such as the legacy of geoscience maps) and related material, reworked or \notherwise. The knowledge system should thus be able to start with conventional \ninformation and incorporate more advanced methods as they prove their worth. \nThe framework must support evolution by modification and replacement of items in the \nintertwined sets of sub-models, objects and methods for processing them. It must be \namended and extended as new topics enlarge its scope. The ontology that specifies this \nconceptualization must accommodate more specialized ontologies referring to sub-\nmodels. Likewise, geoscience ontologies must take their place within the much broader \nframework of the cyberinfrastructure, for geoscience explanations reach out to other \nbranches of science, and users of geoscience information approach it from many different \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 12\nbusiness settings. In the long run, specific markup languages, ontologies and methods \nmay be subsumed in infrastructure products of greater generality, to the advantage of all \nconcerned.  \nNo committee can assemble the wisdom to rationalize the diversity of the knowledge \nsystem. The Semantic Grid may therefore be designed to simplify and rationalize the \nplethora of methods and standpoints by selection through evolutionary processes, perhaps \nguided by the rituals of scientific discourse and of the market place, supported by the \nshared efforts of consortiums, standards committees, Geological Surveys, and other \ninformation communities dedicated to the common good. \n \n5 CONCLUSIONS \n \nThe Grid extends the means of representing, processing and communicating human \nknowledge, by greatly increasing the capacity and power of computer networks and \ninfrastructure services. Geological survey has long focused on cartography, and more \nrecently on its digital equivalents. The large volumes of electronic data from digital \nspatial models and the larger volumes from exploration seismic data can be more readily \ntransmitted through the increased bandwidth of the Grid. But its ability to accommodate \ndetailed relationships may prove more significant. Spatial models and narrative \nexplanations are built side by side, and the Grid provides the opportunity to maintain their \nclose links at all levels of detail, linking data and observational evidence with reasoning, \ninterpretation and explanation.  \nMarkup languages have the potential to link text narrative at all levels of detail with \nspatial models, metadata, Earth processes, experiments, databases, images, material \ncollections, and human experts. Collaborative development of standard frameworks and \nontologies brings unified structures, classifications and vocabularies to this knowledge \nsystem, and encourage their rationalization, thus bringing together the results of many \nindividual efforts. The Grid will enable Geological Surveys and similar organizations to \nprovide services from which users (who best understand their own requirements) can \nobtain appropriate products or create their own. \nBasic geology is at the core of the geoscience knowledge system, and geologists now \nhave an opportunity to embrace a technology free of the constraints of pen, paper and \nprinting press. Geoscientists can move their legacy of existing knowledge into the \nmainstream of a more comprehensive knowledge system, and ensure its appropriate \ndigital preservation. Geological Surveys are well positioned to advance the \ntransformation of this part of the knowledge system, while academic research, such as the \nGEON Program, brings new perspectives to geoscience surveying. \nAcknowledgments  \nI am grateful to the British Geological Survey for making this work possible, in particular \nthe help of Bill Hatton, Ian Smith and John Laxton, and to Boyan Brodaric of the \nGeological Survey of Canada for his encouragement in improving this paper. \nLoudon,TV, 2006 The case for transforming the geological survey knowledge system 13\n \n6 REFERENCES CITED \n \n(Web references as at September 2005) \nAGI, 2004, American Geological Institute: GeoRef Information Services \nhttp:\/\/www.agiweb.org\/georef\/  \nAtkins, D.E., et al.., 2003, Revolutionizing science and engineering through \ncyberinfrastructure: Report of the National Science Foundation Blue-Ribbon Advisory \nPanel on Cyberinfrastructure, 84 p.  \nhttp:\/\/www.communitytechnology.org\/nsf_ci_report\/ExecSum.pdf  \nBerners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., and Lassila, O., 2001, The Semantic Web: \nScientificAmerican.com, May 17, 2001. \nhttp:\/\/www.sciam.com\/article.cfm?articleID=00048144-10D2-1C70-\n84A9809EC588EF21 \nBritish Geological Survey, 2004, BGS GeoPortal: \nhttp:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/scripts\/GeoPortal\/home.cfm, BGS GeoIndex: \nhttp:\/\/www.bgs.ac.uk\/geoindex\/home.html \nBrodaric, B., 2000, Digital geological knowledge: from the field to the map to the \nInternet: Digital Mapping Techniques \u201900 \u2013 Workshop Proceedings.
