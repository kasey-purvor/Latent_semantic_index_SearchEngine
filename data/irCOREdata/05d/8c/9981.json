CdSe QDs were synthesised and purified according to previously \nreported procedures.\n1 Tri-n-butylphosphine selenide (TBP-Se, 1M) was prepared in a \nN2-filled glove box by shaking 0.08 g of selenium powder (Alfa Aesar, 99.999%) in 1 \nmL of TBP. In a typical synthesis, CdO (0.013 g, 0.1mmol) and stearic acid (0.254 g, \n0.89 mmol) were loaded into a three-neck flask and heated to 225 \u00b0C under N2 flow \nand stirring. Once the mixture was completely dissolved, it was allowed to cool to \nroom temperature. Then, 3 g of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and 1 g of \nhexadecylamine were added and the mixture was heated to 225 \u00b0C under N2 flow and \nvigorous stirring. At this temperature, 0.1 mL of the freshly prepared TPB-Se solution \n(0.1 M) was quickly injected into the flask. Following injection the temperature was \nadjusted to ~200 \u00b0C to promote nanocrystal growth.  At various time intervals, \nportions of the mixture were removed and quickly cooled to obtain nanocrystals with \ndifferent sizes (i.e. emission colours). The nanocrystals were dispersed in chloroform \nand precipitated by addition of methanol. After centrifugation the supernatant liquid \nphase was removed. This procedure was repeated at least three times.   The results \nreported in this study are for nanocrystals grown for 3 hours, which had the first \nabsorption band at 574 nm, and a maximum emission peak at 603 nm with excitation \nat 350 nm. The size and concentration of the QD solution was estimated from the \nposition of the first absorption band.\n2 \nFluorescence studies. Equimolar amounts of bipy and MCl2 were mixed in \nacetonitrile and allowed to react for 1 h, after which the solvent was removed under \nvacuum.  The resulting material was dissolved in chloroform for addition to the QD. \nThe fluorescence studies were carried out using freshly prepared chloroform solutions \nof nanocrystals (1.1 \u03bcM). In a typical titration, 0.2 mL of this solution was mixed with \n0.3 mL of the appropriate 1:1 mixture of MCl2 and bipy in chloroform, and the \nfluorescence spectrum was recorded 1-2 hours later. For the titrations of ions in water, \nthe chloroform and water layers were shaken for a few seconds and allowed to stand \nfor 2 hours. Measurements were made with an Edinburgh Instruments FS900 \nfluorimeter.  Excitation was at 350 nm with bandwidths of 2 nm for excitation \n(unpolarised) and emission (unpolarised). Temperature was maintained at 25 \u00b0C. \nElectrochemistry.  Electrochemical studies were carried out using an Autolab \nPGSTAT 20 potentiostat. The cyclic voltammograms were obtained by using a three-\nelectrode configuration consisting of a 0.5 mm diameter Pt disk working electrode, a \nPt rod counter electrode, and an Ag\/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode. All \nmeasurements were made under N2 atmosphere in dry DMF (for bipy) or CH2Cl2 for \nthe metal complexes with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate as the \nsupporting electrolyte at room temperature. \nElectron Microscopy. High-resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies were \nconducted on a JEOL JEM-2011 electron microscope operating at 200 kV. The \nsamples were prepared by depositing a drop of a solution of nanocrystals in pyridine \non a copper specimen grid coated with a holey carbon film and allowing it to dry. \n \nReferences:  \n1.
