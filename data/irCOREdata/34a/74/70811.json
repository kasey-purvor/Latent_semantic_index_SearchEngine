Levels of fire-mediated tree mortality in this study are compared with those in other\nAmazonian forest regions in light of historical factors affecting tree resistance to fires.\nKey Words: Amazonia, bark properties, El Nin\u02dco events, fire disturbance, surface fires, tropical forest\nINTRODUCTION\nFire events within Amazonian forests have been rare over\nthe past 7000 y (Sanford et al. 1985, Turcq et al. 1998)\nand until recently the high rainfall, moist microclimate\nand ability of trees to utilize deep soil water in times of\nlow rainfall (Nepstad et al. 1999) have ensured that trop-\nical rain forests remained largely immune to fires. How-\never, the synergistic effects of forest disturbance, such as\nlogging and extended El Nin\u02dco-mediated dry seasons, have\nalarmingly resulted in increasingly more frequent under-\nstorey fires (Goldammer 1999, Nepstad et al. 1999, Sieg-\nert et al. 2001). Such fires impact severely on the avian\ncommunity (Barlow et al. 2002), cause the mortality of\naround 32\u201344% of trees \u0001 10 cm dbh (Cochrane &\nSchulze 1999, Haugaasen 2000, Holdsworth & Uhl 1997),\nand may switch the lowland Amazon forest from a carbon\nsink (Chambers et al. 2001) to a carbon source (J. Barlow,\nunpubl. data). Recent increases in El Nin\u02dco frequency and\nseverity (Dunbar 2000) and a new wave of forest disturb-\nance and frontier expansion (Nepstad et al. 2001, Peres\n2001) suggest that fire is likely to remain a dominant dis-\nturbance agent in large parts of Amazonia.\nGiven this scenario, a thorough understanding of tree\n1 Corresponding author.

Differential susceptibility of\ntrees to fires would be expected to lead to local extinction\nevents affecting a nested subset of the original species\npool thus altering forest composition. This could have\npotentially disastrous implications for both local people\nwho are heavily reliant on forest resources and for the\nforest fauna as a whole, but particularly frugivorous spe-\ncies dependent on specific food species. While some\nauthors have used standardized burn simulations in order\nto investigate the vulnerability of trees to fires (Pinard &\nHuffman 1997, Uhl & Kaufmann 1990) many of their\npredictions remain largely untested in the field. The\nobjective of this study was therefore to explore the poten-\ntial role of the morphological characteristics of trees in\ndetermining their susceptibility to an unprecedented\nground fire resulting from the 1997\u201398 El Nin\u02dco dry\nseason.\nMany factors may influence tree mortality induced by\nheat stress in Amazonian forests. Holdsworth & Uhl\n(1997) demonstrated that tree mortality was linked to the\ndegree of fire damage received by each tree, whilst Pinard\net al. (1999) found that trees that had died exhibited signi-\nficantly higher char marks. While burn intensity is due to\na combination of many factors, we hypothesized that the\ndepth of the fuel layer around the base of trees could\nJOS BARLOW, BERNARD O. LAGAN AND CARLOS A. PERES292\nexplain some of the variation. Tree size may be another\nimportant factor, and many studies within 18 mo of a fire\nhave uncovered strong size-dependent mortality (Barlow\net al. 2002, Cochrane & Schulze 1999, Peres 1999, Pinard\net al. 1999). Although little is known about the role of\nbuttress roots, both Uhl & Kauffman (1990) and Pinard &\nHuffmann (1997) hypothesized that they might protect\nsome areas of the cambium from fire damage and there-\nfore aid the survival of trees.\nBark thickness is often used as an indication of the fire\ntolerance of trees in fire-adapted ecosystems (Gill 1995,\nHarmon 1984). Within Amazonian forests both Uhl &\nKauffman (1990) and Pinard & Huffman (1997) found\nbark thickness to explain a high degree of the variance in\npeak cambial temperatures (77% and 63%, respectively)\nduring experimental burns. Bark roughness may also be\nimportant as external bark characteristics can affect\nexternal bark temperatures (Uhl & Kauffman 1990), with\nthin exfoliating barks becoming hotter than fissured barks\nwith greater surface areas. Other bark properties such as\nmoisture content and specific gravity appear to have little\ninfluence on the thermal diffusity of bark (Martin 1962,\nPinard & Huffman 1997, Uhl & Kauffman 1990, Vines\n1968) and were not examined here. However, we expli-\ncitly considered the presence of latex and resins because\ntheir functional role in mediating post-fire mortality\nremains poorly known. Tree species possessing latex and\nresins have been found to be more frequent in heavily\ndisturbed forests (Hegde et al. 1998) and it may be that\nthese traits may protect trees from heat stress or from\npost-fire pathogen infections and invertebrate infestations.\nConversely, latex and resins may act to increase mortality\nby increasing bark flammability.\nSTUDY SITE\nThis study was carried out in the Rio Arapiuns region of\nwestern Para\u00b4, central Brazilian Amazonia (02\u00b039\u2032S,\n55\u00b036\u2032W). Most forest plots were located within the\nTapajo\u00b4s\u2013Arapiuns Extractive Reserve, and were distrib-\nuted around four villages: Pasqual and Mentai on the Rio\nArapiuns, and Sa\u02dco Jose\u00b4 and Cachoeira do Maro\u00b4 on the\nRio Maro\u00b4 (one of the two major tributaries of the\nArapiuns). Four burnt forest plots were sampled around\neach village, and eight unburnt plots were sampled in the\nvicinities of Sa\u02dco Jose\u00b4 and Cachoeira do Maro\u00b4. The extens-\nive burn coverage in the Rio Arapiuns meant that it was\nnot possible to examine control plots in the vicinity of\nMentai and Pasqual.\nMuch of this forest had been subjected to a surface fire\nin the period between December 1997 and January 1998\ncoinciding with a prolonged dry season resulting from the\n1997\u201398 El Nin\u02dco southern oscillation (ENSO) event.\nAlthough characterized by low flame heights (usually 10\u2013\n25 cm), such surface fires were sufficiently intense to burn\nthe leaf litter and scorch the forest understorey to a height\nof approximately 2.5 m, but generally caused little struc-\ntural damage to midstorey and canopy trees which in the\nshort term remained largely foliated (Peres 1999). Inter-\nviews with local people confirmed that this was the only\ntime these plots had burnt within living memory. Further\ndetails on the study area can be found in Barlow et al.\n(2002).\nMETHODS\nA total of 24 0.25-ha (10 \u00d7 250 m) forest plots were exam-\nined between September 2000 and June 2001. Sixteen\nplots lay within burnt forest, and were sampled in\nAugust\u2013September 2000 in order to minimize any time-\ndependent variation in the effects of fire disturbance. The\nremaining eight plots were sampled in unburnt forest. To\navoid edge-dependent mortality (Laurance 2000), plots\nwere placed at least 200 m from the forest edge, and at\nleast 500 m from the clearly distinguishable fireline separ-\nating burnt and unburnt forest. We examined all trees \u0001\n10 cm dbh (diameter at breast height, or above the tallest\nbuttress) that lay within each 0.25-ha plot, excluding those\nwith more than half of their basal trunk outside the plot.\nTrees were classed as dead if they were leafless and\nwith a complete ring of dead cambium at breast height.\nThe variables measured for each tree depended on their\nstatus (i.e. alive or dead) and whether they were within\nburnt or unburnt forest. However, the dbh of all trees was\nmeasured and each tree was assigned according to the\ntrunk characteristic of its base (either unbuttressed, but-\ntressed or stilted). Species with strongly canulated\n(channelled) trunks (e.g. such as Minquartia guianensis\nAubl.) were included in the buttressed category.\nWhilst bark thickness was recorded on both living and\ndead trees in all forest plots, only data from live trees are\nused here as we were unable to determine the original\nthickness of the desiccated bark on dead trees. Palms\n(Arecaceae) were also excluded as their phloem and\nxylem tissues run throughout their stems (Gill 1995). For\neach tree the bark thickness was recorded from small\nsamples (c. 10 cm2) taken at 1 m in height. Following\nPinard & Huffman (1997), the maximum thickness was\nmeasured whenever variation was detected in the sample.\nBark texture was also graded as either rough (strongly\nfissured, or very scaly\/flaky), medium (lightly fissured or\nscaly\/flaky) or smooth. On all living trees, the occurrence\nof either latex or resin was recorded from the incision\nmade to sample the bark thickness. Both colour and\nabundance were noted, the latter being classed into four\ngroupings: absent, present but not free flowing, weakly\nflowing and strongly flowing.\nThe visible char height of the fires was noted on the\ntrunk of all trees examined in the 16 burnt forest plots.\nChar heights were then categorized as following: 0 = no\nMorphological correlates of tree mortality 293\nvisible fire marks; 1 = burnt at base to 30 cm; 2 = burnt\nfrom 30 cm to breast height (1.3 m); and 3 = burnt above\nbreast height. Two additional variables were recorded in\nthe unburnt forest. The fuel depth at the base of trees,\ndefined as the vertical distance from the bottom of the\nlitter layer to the highest dead leaf or twig within 5 cm of\nthe trunk, was measured using methods similar to those\nof Uhl & Kaufman (1990). This was recorded at the base\nof all trees measured in six of the unburnt forest plots,\nand for the first 50 m of the remaining two unburnt forest\nplots. In addition, bark thickness at 30 cm height was also\nrecorded for all live trees in the first 50 m of each unburnt\nforest plot.\nAt all plots both fallen wood and canopy cover were\nalso recorded, though only the former is considered here.\nFor each piece of fallen wood \u0001 10 cm in diameter, the\nlength (only sections lying within the 10 \u00d7 250 m plot)\nand diameter (either at 1.3 m from basal tree trunks where\nthe base was within the plot, or at the nearest point within\nthe plot to the base) were recorded. Fallen trees with their\nbases within the 0.25-ha plots were noted, and were sim-\nilarly scored according to the type of basal tree trunk as\neither unbuttressed, buttressed or stilted. Because of the\nsmall sample of stilted trees, only unbuttressed and but-\ntressed trees are considered hereafter.\nDATA ANALYSIS\nWe sampled burnt and unburnt forest plots 3 y after the\nfires, and much of the analysis is based on the assumption\nthat the pre-burn forest structure and composition were\nsimilar across plots. Although this is difficult to ascertain\ndue to the intervening time and the drastic changes in\nforest structure caused by the fires (Haugaasen 2000,\nPeres 1999), ANOVA and \u03c72 were used to check the pre-\nburn structural similarity of two variables (dbh and occur-\nrence of buttress roots) in the unburnt forest, the burnt\nforest plots close to the unburnt forest and the eight burnt\nplots far from the unburnt forest. Where it was not pos-\nsible to check for pre-burn similarity (i.e. for character-\nistics such as latex, resin, and bark thickness and bark\nroughness) we restricted comparisons between burnt and\nunburnt forest to the 16 plots in the Rio Maro\u00b4, minimizing\nthe potential influence of spatial changes in floristics.\nBecause of the high variation in burn intensity within\nburnt forest (Cochrane & Schulze 1999), we pooled data\nfrom all forest plots and carried out all analyses at the\nlevel of individual trees.\nAs we were unable to accurately measure some of the\ntree properties investigated in dead trees (i.e. bark thick-\nness, bark roughness and the presence of latex and resin),\nit was only possible to look for effects within these groups\nby comparing their prevalence amongst the living trees in\nthe burnt and unburnt forest. Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests were\nused to compare bark roughness scores, and the abund-\nance of latex and resin scores in both forest types. Ana-\nlysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to control for\nthe effects of tree size (dbh) in comparing the bark thick-\nness in burnt and unburnt forest, and the fuel build-up\nbetween unbuttressed and buttressed trees. Paired t-tests\nwere used to compare the bark thickness at 30 cm and\n130 cm on buttressed and unbuttressed trees. Bark thick-\nness was square-root transformed in all analyses. Spear-\nman correlations were used to relate fuel-layer depth and\nchar height with tree size.\nDbh, the presence of buttresses and burn height scores\nwere used as independent variables to predict mortality in\nlogistic regression models. Bark thickness was not\nincluded as the desiccated bark on dead trees was not con-\nsidered to give an accurate measure of living bark thick-\nness. Analyses were carried out separately for the burnt\nand the unburnt forest, and data from all sites were\nentered into the model. This was justified as Kruskal\u2013\nWallis tests showed that there was no significant differ-\nence between the prevalence of either the number of trees\n(either as a whole or grouped by dbh class) or of but-\ntresses at the four burnt sites (J. Barlow, unpubl. data).\nFurthermore, site was not significant when entered in the\nmodel as a categorical variable, and did not influence the\noverall results. All analysis was undertaken in SPSS v.\n10, and measures of variance around the mean are stand-\nard errors (\u00b1SE).\nRESULTS\nA total of 2829 standing trees were recorded in all 24\nforest plots, including 1075 within unburnt forest and\n1754 within burnt forest. A total of 93 of these were\npalms, 33 were woody lianas, whereas 10 were trees that\nwere fast-growing pioneer species considered to have\ngrown to a girth of \u0001 10 cm dbh since the fires (Cecropia\nspp. and Palicourea guianensis Aubl.). Overall levels of\ndetected mortality (measured as the death of all standing\nand recently fallen stems) in the burnt-forest plots (34%)\nwere many times higher than the background levels in\nunburnt-forest plots (7%).\nPre-burn forest similarity\nThe burnt forest had fewer trees per plot than the unburnt\nforest, this being due to the lower abundance of trees in\nthe smallest size class (10\u201319.9 cm dbh; Table 1). Many\nmore trees had fallen in the burnt forest (195) than in the\nunburnt forest (36), and there was no difference between\nburnt plots grouped by their location (Table 1). The pro-\nportion of trees with buttress roots per plot was very sim-\nilar between unburnt-forest and burnt-forest plots both\nclose to and far from the controls (Table 1), and buttressed\ntrees were no more likely to have fallen than trees without\nbuttresses (\u03c72 = 2.75, df = 1, P > 0.05).\nJOS BARLOW, BERNARD O.

Only 7% of stems (n = 120) were\nburnt above breast height (1.3 m). Of the three variables\nincorporated into the logistic regression model, burn\nheight score was the best predictor of mortality status\n(Table 2). This strong effect of burn height upon tree mor-\ntality is also shown in Figure 1, where there was a positive\nrelationship between the proportion of dead trees per plot\n(grouped by their char height score) and their char height\nscore.\nTree size\nDbh was a significant predictor of mortality in the burnt\nforest (Table 2) and the only significant predictor of mortal-\nity in the unburnt forest, although the direction of its influ-\nence was reversed (Table 2). As expected from this size-\ndependent mortality, the mean dbh of live trees in the burnt\nforest plots was significantly higher than that in unburnt\nforest (Table 3). Dbhwas also positively correlated with the\nmaximum fuel depth in unburnt-forest plots and the burn\nheight scores in burnt forest, these associations being signi-\nficant for both buttressed and unbuttressed trees (Table 4).\nTable 2.

LAGAN AND CARLOS A. PERES296\nall mean of 5.5 \u00b1 0.13 mm for all trees \u0001 10 cm dbh and\n7.9 \u00b1 0.024 mm for all trees > 20 cm dbh. However, a\nvast proportion of all trees in this central Amazonian flora\nwere typically thin-barked. A total of 59.4% of all trees,\ncomprising 16% of the basal area, had a bark thickness of\nless than 5 mm whereas only 10.6% of trees (or 32% of\nthe basal area) had a bark thickness of at least 10 mm.\nBark thickness was significantly related to dbh (live trees\nonly in unburnt forest; y = 1.76x + 0.016, r2 = 0.35, F1,968 =\n509, P < 0.001).\nThe mean bark thickness of live trees in burnt forest\n(eight plots in Rio Maro only) was significantly greater\nthan that in unburnt forest, even when dbh was taken into\naccount (mean unburnt forest = 55 mm \u00b1 1.3; burnt\nforest = 63 mm \u00b1 1.6; ANCOVA corrected model, F2,1485 =\n422, P < 0.001, forest type, F1,1485 = 26, P < 0.001, dbh\n(covariate), F1,1485 = 26, P < 0.001). Although there was\nno significant difference in bark thickness between heights\nat 30 cm and 130 cm for unbuttressed trees (mean at 30\ncm = 0.49 \u00b1 0.03 mm; mean at 130 cm = 0.49 \u00b1 0.03\nmm; paired-t = \u22120.08, df = 97, P = 0.93), bark thickness\nat 30 cm height was significantly thinner than that at 130\ncm for buttressed trees (mean at 30 cm = 0.38 \u00b1 0.03 mm;\nmean at 130 cm = 0.49 \u00b1 0.03 mm; paired-t = 5.6, df =\n75, P < 0.001). Moreover, amongst all living trees in the\nunburnt forest, buttressed trees had significantly thinner\nbarks at 130 cm than did unbuttressed trees (mean unbut-\ntressed = 0.6 \u00b1 0.02 mm, mean buttressed = 0.48 \u00b1 0.02\nmm; t = 4.6, df = 969, P < 0.001).\nOther bark characteristics\nThere was no significant difference between the bark\nroughness, or the abundance of either latex or resin\nbetween all unburnt-forest and burnt-forest plots (P =\n0.09, 0.23 and 0.39 respectively). However, when this\nanalysis was restricted to the eight burnt plots that were\nclose to the control plots, resins were significantly less\nabundant and barks were significantly rougher in the burnt\nforest (Table 3). Because bark roughness was significantly\ncorrelated with bark thickness (rs = 0.38, n = 1013, P <\n0.001), trees were grouped into six categories according\nto their bark thickness in order to test the effects of bark\nroughness independently of bark thickness. Bark was sig-\nnificantly rougher in trees in the burnt forest with a bark\nthickness of between 0.2\u20130.6 cm (Table 2).\nDISCUSSION\nPre-burn forest similarity\nAlthough there were significantly fewer stems \u0001 10 cm\ndbh in the burnt forest, this was largely a result of a num-\neric decline in the 10\u201320-cm dbh class in the Rio Arapiuns\nplots (Table 1). These smaller midstorey trees account for\nonly a small proportion of forest biomass, and were the\nmost likely to have gone undetected in the survey of fallen\nwood in the burnt forest, especially as some may have\neither combusted or decayed. Furthermore, stems that had\nfallen before the fire were likely to have burnt and there-\nfore been underestimated. Lower standing-stem densities\nfollowing fires have also been found by Holdsworth &\nUhl (1997) and, like them, we do not attribute the margin-\nally lower stem density to any pre-burn differences. Fur-\nthermore, interviews with local communities at the four\nvillages affected by this fire confirmed the assumption that\nthese forests were structurally similar prior to the fires.\nMorphological correlates of tree mortality\nAlthough the size-dependent mortality of trees is not a\nuniversal phenomenon following fires in tropical forests\n(Holdsworth & Uhl 1997) it has been frequently observed\nfollowing low-intensity fires (Cochrane & Schulze 1999,\nPeres 1999, Pinard et al. 1999). The normal expectation\nis that small trees will be more at risk because of their\nthinner bark and the increased chance of complete flame\ncoverage (Gutsell & Johnson 1996, Pinard & Huffman\n1997, Uhl & Kauffman 1990). Although strong size-\ndependent mortality was detected in these forests both 1\u2013\n2 mo after (Peres 1999) and 1 y after this fire (Barlow et\nal. 2002), the effects after 3 y appear to be weaker. Since\nsmall trees were apparently no more likely to fall than\nlarge trees (J. Barlow, unpubl. data), this may be attrib-\nuted to a stronger physiological lag effect delaying the\nmortality of large, and initially more resistant, canopy\ntrees.\nBark thickness of live trees at this site was similar to\nthat observed in Paragominas, eastern Amazonia (Uhl &\nKaufman 1990), and tree dbh explained very similar\namounts of the variance (this study: r2 = 0.35; Uhl &\nKauffman 1990: r2 = 0.38). Because live trees had signi-\nficantly thicker barks in the burnt forest, we can surmise\nthat thin-barked trees were most susceptible to the fires.\nOur results therefore support the conclusions of studies\non fire disturbance in both eastern Amazonia (Uhl &\nKauffman 1990) and eastern Bolivia (Pinard & Huffman\n1997) that bark thickness is an important morphological\ncorrelate of tree survival. Both bark roughness and the\npresence of resins appeared to be important determinants\nof tree mortality. Rougher bark may increase the boundary\nlayer (Dickinson & Johnson 2001) resulting in lower sur-\nface bark temperatures (Uhl & Kauffman 1990). Although\nour findings of fewer resin-secreting trees in the burnt\nforest are contrary to the findings of Hegde et al. (1998),\nthey are not surprising as many of the resins produced by\nProtium spp. and Hymenaea spp. are flammable. How-\never, these results should be viewed with caution because\nof our lack of \u2018before\u2019 control plots providing background\ndata on pre-burn resin and latex abundance. Experimental\nMorphological correlates of tree mortality 297\nburns within smaller areas would allow these effects to be\nexamined in more detail.\nSurprisingly, and contrary to our initial expectation,\nbuttressed trees were significantly more likely to suc-\ncumb to fire-induced mortality. This runs against previ-\nous conjectures that buttresses might be able to protect\nvital cambium tissues from fire damage, thus aiding the\nprobability of tree survival (Pinard & Huffman 1997,\nUhl & Kauffman 1990). This could have two explana-\ntions. First, buttressed trees tended to collect more leaf\nlitter at their bases, which in turn apparently contributed\nto their higher burn heights. Second, the higher probab-\nility of mortality for buttressed trees may relate to bark\nthickness differences. Not only do buttressed trees have\nsignificantly thinner barks for their size, they also have\nthinner bark at their bases, coinciding with the area of\nmaximum flame temperature during surface wildfires\n(see Gill 1995).\nBurn intensity and fuel depth\nAlthough results from this study are generally consistent\nwith the notion that some of the morphological traits of\ntrees can influence their fire tolerance (Pinard & Huffman\n1997, Uhl & Kauffman 1990), local fire intensity\nappeared to be the most important determinant of tree\nmortality. The strong relationship between burn severity\nand mortality rate is very similar to that uncovered by\nHoldsworth & Uhl (1997), whilst Pinard et al. (1999) also\nfound dead trees to exhibit significantly higher char\nheights. Because of the importance of burn intensity in\ndetermining mortality, an understanding of its environ-\nmental determinants will aid our ability to predict and per-\nhaps avert the potential consequences of fires.\nAt one hypothetical extreme, burn intensity could be\npurely stochastic and determined by the local combination\nof humidity, wind and temperature, and the coarse and\nfine fuel-load conditions on the forest floor. Just as log-\nging increases the intensity of fires by opening up the\ncanopy (thereby reducing humidity and augmenting fuel\ndry-down rates: Holdsworth & Uhl 1997) and increasing\nthe fuel load on the forest floor (Uhl & Kauffman 1990),\nso may natural treefall gaps. It is perhaps noteworthy that\nthe figure of 7% of severely burnt trees closely resembles\nthe proportion of typical unburnt primary forest occupied\nby treefall gaps (J. Barlow, unpubl. data). Further vari-\nation in burn intensity may stem from the fact that parts\nof this forest burned twice in the same year, with smoul-\ndering logs re-igniting the fresh leaf fall from severely\nheat-stressed trees in the immediate aftermath of the fires\n(C. Peres, pers. obs.).\nHowever, our measurements of fuel depth in the\nunburnt forest show that the distribution and accumulation\nof fine fuel is not random, with the stem bases of large\ntrees and buttressed trees contacting heavier fuel loads. In\nthe case of tree size, heavier fuel loads may explain the\nweak effect that tree girth had upon the likelihood of mor-\ntality; while the thicker bark surfaces afforded by these\ntrees may have conferred greater insulation from lethal\nheat stress, the greater fuel depth may have contributed to\nthe increased char heights on large stems (although it is\ndifficult to separate this from the effect that leeward vor-\ntices may have had in determining char height: Dickin-\nson & Johnson 2001). Indeed, dbh was not a significant\ndeterminant of mortality in the logistic regression models\nunless the char height was added as a covariate. In the\ncase of buttressed trees, heavier fuel loads may have con-\ntributed directly to their mortality rates, though it is diffi-\ncult to dissociate this from the influence of their thinner\nbark.\nFire tolerance of Amazonian forests\nOverall, the majority of trees in the forests of the Arapiuns\nregion appeared to be extremely intolerant to the levels of\nthermal stress generated by surface fires. Although true\nlevels of tree mortality were probably higher than those\nreported here (some stems may have burnt, or fallen and\ngone undetected in the dense regeneration), the detected\nmortality of around 34% of all trees \u0001 10 cm dbh is still\nhigh compared with mortality rates of between 8\u201323%\ndocumented for forest sites at the fringes of the Amazon\nbasin (Barbosa & Fearnside 1999, Pinard & Huffman\n1997, Santos et al. 1998) where a repeated history of fires\nmay have exerted stronger selective pressure on the evolu-\ntion of fire tolerance, or traits conferring some mechanism\nof fire resistance. As in other regions that could be\ndescribed as core Amazonian forest (Uhl & Kauffman\n1990), trees in our study area are typically characterized\nby thin bark, perhaps reflecting the extremely rare history\nof fires in these regions. Although data on carbon-dated\ncharcoal from the Arapiuns forests remain unavailable at\npresent, we predict that the periodicity of major fires in\nthis area is far less frequent than those at the edges of\nthe Gran Savannah of southern Venezuela (Sanford et al.\n1985). In addition, our measurements of bark thickness\nalong the trunk of a large set of trees in central Amazonia\nare in stark contrast to those in fire-adapted temperate for-\nests where thick bark near the basal tree trunk can aid\nsurvival in low-intensity ground fires (Harmon 1984).\nFire-prone Amazonian forests in the future\nAlthough our results indicate that some morphological\ntraits such as thick bark and cylindrical trunks can confer\nsurvival advantages, the regional extinction of many fire-\nintolerant species following a light burn is unlikely\nbecause of the considerable spatial heterogeneity of burn\nintensity. Furthermore, the future composition of these\nforests will depend on much more than the tolerance of\nJOS BARLOW, BERNARD O. LAGAN AND CARLOS A. PERES298\nmature individuals of each species to low-intensity burns.\nSpecies persistence will be determined by the survival of\ntheir seeds within the seedbank, their abilities to germin-\nate in the post-fire microclimatic environment and com-\npete with light-demanding pioneer vegetation such as\nlianas and herbaceous vines (Pinard et al. 1999, Uhl et al.\n1988) as well as by the responses of their pollinators and\nseed dispersers. Although the ability to resprout from the\nbase following fires has also been considered an important\naid to survival following forest clearance (Uhl et al. 1982)\nand low-intensity burns in terra firme forests (Pinard et\nal. 1999, Uhl et al. 1988), this was rarely observed during\nthis study. This is in agreement with the findings of\nWoods (1989), and indicates that the heat stress at the\nbase of trees that had died was also sufficiently lethal to\ndestroy the dormant meristematic tissue (Uhl et al. 1988).\nBut by far the greatest threat to species persistence is\nthat posed by high-intensity recurrent burns (Cochrane &\nSchulze 1999, Goldammer 1999, Nepstad et al. 1999).\nThe increased severity of a recurrent burn can be expected\nto kill a much greater proportion of the seedbank, whilst\nthe dispersal of many large-seeded species will be\nhindered by the absence of many large-bodied vertebrate\ndispersers from forest that has burnt more than once (J.\nBarlow, unpubl. data). Furthermore, given the frequency\nof the current El Nin\u02dco-mediated fire regime in tropical\nforests (Goldammer 1999, Nepstad et al. 1999, Siegert et\nal. 2001), post-burn saplings and juveniles are unlikely to\nhave enough time to grow into a size class that will enable\nthem to survive a recurrent burn. Moreover, the close\nproximity of any resprouting stems to the woody fuel\nfrom neighbouring dead stems may make them especially\nvulnerable to future fires. It may be that the frequency of\nrepeated fires mediated by the present day El Nin\u02dco period-\nicity will create conditions unsuitable for tree regenera-\ntion, converting forested areas threatened by fire into\nrather simplified scrub savannas.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis study was partly funded by the Center for Applied\nBiodiversity Science of Conservation International.
