Clues to earlier \nmanufacture come from Montemor, where 306 \nfl awed vessels and wasters were found in the fi lls of \nvaults of the 16th-century Dominican priory of \nS\u00e3o Domingos. These pieces are unlikely to have \nbeen transported far and provide evidence for the \nlocal production of vessels in \u2018red clay\u2019,5 among the \npieces collected being a two-handled costrel very \nsimilar to those found in England (see below). \nNearby Crato (Fig. 2) is also known to have been \nan important pottery centre since at least the 14th \ncentury and manufacture was later stimulated here \nin the 17th century by King Alfonso VI\u2019s grants of \nprivileges for the free extraction of potting clay.6 \nProduction continued well into the 19th century, \nwhen most of the inhabitants were potters. Pottery \nrecovered from excavations confi rms the presence \nof local pots in several fabrics, one of them being \ncharacteristically red, but all containing abundant \nquartz and mica. These differences in fabrics can at \nleast partly be explained by potters using local \nclays of differing colour and quality.7 The region \nwas well linked strategically to Lisbon, from where \npots could be exported by sea.\nTHE ASSEMBLAGE FROM \nSOUTHAMPTON\nIn 1973\u201374 large-scale excavations either side of \nthe bailey wall of the castle in Upper Bugle Street \nin Southampton (Fig. 1) produced more than 400 \ndifferent vessels of Merida-type ware (7,164 sherds, \nabout 85kg), the largest assemblage ever found \nin northern Europe. Remarkably, most of these \nvessels came from a single context [B88] and, \nalthough occasional sherds (2.8%) were also found \nin surrounding layers, it is a single substantial \ndeposit of contemporary material.1 \nMerida-type ware is a misnomer for Por-\ntuguese coarsewares of characteristic brick-red \nfabric with quartz and mica inclusions, which were \nprobably manufactured in the High Alentejo, \nan area extending inland from Lisbon and to the \neast.2 Micaceous wares have traditionally been \nmanu factured right across this part of the country, \nover the border into Spain (although fabrics and \nforms differ there) and as far as Merida in Badajoz \n(Fig. 2). The generic term Merida-type ware was \nadopted in the 1960s when it was assumed that \nthe production of early post-medieval micaceous \nfabrics was centred on Merida, a well-known \nRoman pottery centre under active investigation at \nthat time.3 The term \u2018Merida-type ware\u2019 has been \nretained by most scholars until further study is able \nto pinpoint and clarify the range of sources and \nworkshops. \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nPo\nst-\nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\nPORTUGUESE COARSEWARES IN ENGLAND 65\nFIG. 1\nThe sites mentioned in the text located on a reconstructed early 17th-century Southampton, based on Speed\u2019s map of \n1611 and the 1454 terrier (Burgess 1976).

The fabric is very fi ne and hard, \nthe only visible inclusions (x20 magnifi cation) \nbeing sparse transparent rounded quartz, poorly \nsorted, 0.2\u20131mm in size, rare white quartz up \nto 2mm and rare clay relicts up to 0.5mm. The \nmain characteristic of the fabric, however, is the \nabundant quantity of poorly sorted mica fl akes up \nto 3mm across which glint visibly on the surface of \nthe pots with a yellow or red sheen.\nMost of the bases are heavily covered in \npure mica plates, suggesting that the vessels would \nhave stood on mica powder or at least a highly \nmicaceous clay dust while they were being deco-\nrated and the handles added, presumably to avoid \nthe vessel sticking to the working surface or table. \nAll the vessels are unglazed, but the visible \nsurface (exterior of closed forms; interior of open \nforms) has been smoothed over with a narrow tool. \nSometimes this amounts to real burnishing, with \nshiny lines being drawn on the red surfaces. \nFORMS\nAlthough no complete vessels were recovered from \nthe excavations at Upper Bugle Street, several \ntypes were clearly present, including both open and \nclosed forms (Figs 3\u20137). Their distribution across \nexcavated contexts is indicated in Tables 1 and 2.\nThere are a minimum of 36 lebrillos or \nfl ared bowls in several different sizes. The larger \nones range between 400 and 600mm in diameter, \nalthough the smaller ones, sometimes called dishes, \nare half that size, between 200 and 250mm in \ndiameter. All have plain bases, but their rim \nprofi les vary from plain or everted to square. \nThe interiors of the smaller forms are sometimes \nburnished with concentric lines. \nThe most common type of vessel present in \nthe Southampton assemblage is a bowl with \nconvex sides somewhat smaller than lebrillos; 1,237 \nrims of this form alone were recovered (13.1kg). \nAlthough a handful of examples have a carinated \nprofi le (Fig. 4:15\u201317) and a couple of examples \nhave a footring, they are the exceptions; most \nof the bases are slightly concave or even recessed \n(Fig. 4:18) and between 50 and 80mm in diameter. \nTwo main types of rim can be identifi ed, although \nthere were many slight differences and identical \nforms were infrequent. The most abundant is plain \nand everted, usually with an incised line on the \nexterior wall, just below the rim (for example, \nFig. 4:3\u20135). The second most common type of \nrim is clubbed, being square and projecting (for \nexample, Fig. 4:8\u20139). Like the lebrillos, the walls \nof these bowls are sometimes burnished with \nconcentric lines on their interiors. \nThe jars are all very fragmented, although a \nvariety of rim profi les, straight necks and narrow \nbases can still be picked out (Fig. 5). Invariably \nthey have a burnished exterior wall with vertical \nlines, and one has concentric burnished bands \nFIG. 2\nThe Alentejo area of Portugal and other places mentioned in the text.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nPo\nst-\nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\nPORTUGUESE COARSEWARES IN ENGLAND 67\naround the body. On the basis of the rims \nrecovered, at least 46 jars are present. It is possible \nthat a few decorated small body sherds might \nbelong also to jars. These have incised and \nburnished decoration (Fig. 5:26\u201330).\nThe main difference between Merida-type \ncostrels and bottles is the presence of two handles \non the former. Both types are effectively jars \nwith narrow mouths and necks standing about \n200\u2013250mm tall. Given their similarity in shape, it \nis not always easy to differentiate between them, \nalthough bottles are rarely found in Britain at \nthis date. A further type of costrel in the shape \nof a barrel can be also be identifi ed by the rilled, \ntall necks (Fig. 6:1\u20132; the shape here has been \nreconstructed from a complete vessel found in \nPlymouth8). Judging by the number of bases in the \nassemblage, there are a minimum of 44 costrels\/\nbottles. \nSmall jugs have plain rims, globular bodies, \nplain splayed bases and a single handle (Fig. 7:1\u2013\n11). No spouts were identifi ed among a minimum \nnumber of 70 examples in the assemblage, and \nfrom parallels elsewhere it seems they may not \nhave had them. They stand about 120mm tall \n(that illustrated in Fig. 7:10 is reconstructed from \nseveral sherds from different vessels). They are \nalways burnished on the exterior wall, usually with \nFIG. 3\nSouthampton, Upper Bugle Street: Merida-type lebrillos.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nPo\nst-\nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\n68 ALEJANDRA GUTI\u00c9RREZ\na lattice pattern, and are notably delicate and \nthin-walled. \nFinally, the sugar moulds are cone-\nshaped with a hole in the base (Fig. 7:12\u201317). \nTwo different types of rims are present: collared \nand plain, sometimes with one or two incised \nexterior lines around the rim (Fig.  7:12\u201315). \nThe diameter of the rim varies between 200 and \n340mm.

Finds have been retrieved from excavated \ncontexts in the town from as early as the beginning \nof the 14th century. Three different costrels were \nfound in 1300\u201350 contexts in the High Street; and \na further example of mid-14th-century date comes \nfrom Cuckoo Lane.17 Vessels of this type continued \nto be used in the town during the medieval period \nand until the middle of the 17th century. Costrels \nwere the most common form during the 14th\u201316th \ncenturies and, all told, at least 44 of them have been \nfound across the town. Among the other forms \nidentifi ed there are eight bowls and two lebrillos \n(mainly in 16th-century contexts), 21 jars and jugs, \nsix olive jars, two lids, and seventeen sugar moulds. \nIn this latter group, single moulds were found on \nexcavations near Upper Bugle Street and St John\u2019s \nLane, and a much larger group of fi fteen vessels (36 \nsherds) were excavated from the Arcades site by \nthe quay (Fig. 1). Overall, Portuguese coarsewares \nhave been recovered from 28 different excavations \nacross Southampton18 and, although the numbers \nmight not look spectacular in comparison with \nthe quantity of local pottery, they help to put fi nds \nfrom elsewhere in England into context. \nAcross Britain and Ireland Merida-type ware \nhas been found on about 100 sites,19 although it \nonly seems to appear in large quantities in London \nand the southern ports, the main points of entry for \nTABLE 1\nSouthampton, Upper Bugle Street: distribution of \nMerida-type wares in context [B88] (weight and \nnumber of fragments)\nForm Sherd type g No.\nLebrillo rim 1,571 33\n base 1,764 40\nBowl rim 13,193 1,237\n base 5,452 354\n wall 78 6\nBowl\/lebrillo wall 7,487 972\nJars neck 1,085 58\n wall (burnished) 4,981 722\nCostrels\/bottles rim 273 32\n neck 85 27\nCostrel? rim 28 2\nJars\/costrels handle 2,004 78\nJars\/costrels base 1,784 66\nSmall jugs rim 159 72\n base 897 80\n wall 1,917 698\n handle 366 72\nSugar moulds rim 8,340 76\n base 1,423 44\nSugar moulds,  wall 27,048 2,272\njars, costrels\nMisc. rim 706 20\nTotal  80,641 6,961\nTABLE 2\nSouthampton, Upper Bugle Street: distribution of Merida-type wares in other contexts \n(weight and number of fragments)\n  [B106] [B109] [B132] [B143] [B168] [B198] [B226]\nForm Sherd  g No. g No. g No. g No. g No. g No. g No.\nLebrillo rim 285 4 \u2013 \u2013 83 2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 43 2 19 1\nBowl rim 72 6 \u2013 \u2013 111 11 7 1 39 2 29 4 95 6\n base 92 6 \u2013 \u2013 53 5 100 4 \u2013 \u2013 8 2 29 2\nBowl\/lebrillo wall 221 11 \u2013 \u2013 77 9 10 3 21 2 1 1 195 6\n base 236 6 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 43 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nSmall jug wall \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 4 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n base 18 1   \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n handle 6 2   \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nJars rim \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 26 1\n wall 36 7 \u2013 \u2013 100 12 114 8 4 1 88 7 87 8\n base 83 1   \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nSugar cone rim 624 7 \u2013 \u2013 63 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n wall \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 108 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n base \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 69 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nMisc. wall 981 34 22 2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 89 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n handle 101 4   \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nTotal  2,755 89 22 2 595 44 347 19 53 9 169 16 451 24\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nPo\nst-\nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\nPORTUGUESE COARSEWARES IN ENGLAND 73\nPortuguese goods. Finds from London amount \nto about 300 sherds and derive from contexts \ndated between the middle of the 15th and mid-19th \ncenturies; quantities are spread across the capital \nand the largest assemblage so far recorded amounts \nto about 110 sherds of 18th-century vessels from \nexcavations along the waterfront.20\nAmong the southern ports, the main concen-\ntrations are at Poole, Portsmouth and especially \nPlymouth. The role of Bristol remains unknown \nsince fi nds there are as yet unquantifi ed.21 The \nmaterial from Poole amounts to 204 sherds; the \nearliest (11%) dates to the 14th\u201315th centuries from \nbeach sand pre-reclamation and consists only of \ncostrels. A range of other forms including olive \njars, bowls, lebrillos, dishes and small jugs was also \nfound in 16th- and 17th-century town houses and \ntenements there.22 The quantities from Plymouth \nare even greater, with 1,600 sherds recovered from \na single excavation in St Andrews Street.23\nThis coastal urban presence is undoubtedly \nthe most striking feature of the distribution of \nMerida-type pottery in England, but it does not by \nany means account for all known fi nds. Costrels, \njars and bowls have also been collected at magnate \nresidences and religious sites, usually one or two \nvessels at each place only, among them Bishop\u2019s \nWaltham palace, Romsey Abbey and Wickham \nGlebe moated site (Hants), Shapwick moated \nsite, Woodspring Priory and Cleeve Abbey \n(Somerset) and Polsloe Priory (Devon).24 Most of \nthese vessels found are containers of some kind, \nsuch as the olive jar from Romsey Abbey (16th\u2013\n17th centuries) or the costrel from Cleeve Abbey \n(mid-16th century); a possible globular jug was \nalso found at the former and a bowl and lid from \nPolsloe Priory, here dated by the accompanying \nwares to the Dissolution deposits of around 1536.\nOne exception is the much larger group from \nthe moated site at Acton Court, in south Glouces-\ntershire, which is dated to the 16th century and \ntotals 92 sherds. Half of these were found in the \npre-1540s fi ll of the moat where they appear \ntogether with other uncommon imports, such as \nPlain Blue albarelli from Seville,25 Seville white-\nware, Martincamp fl asks, Beauvais wares and Ital-\nian maiolicas.26 The quantity and range of imports \npresent here is unusual; it is most likely that at least \nsome of the vessels were acquired directly by Sir \nRobert Poyntz (1467\u20131520). Although a member \nof the gentry, Sir Robert had commercial interests \nin Bristol, acting as the king\u2019s agent there, and \nhe later became chancellor to Queen Catherine of \nAragon (d. 1536).27 His trading contacts might help \nexplain why he had access to less common types of \npottery. The chapel where he was to be buried, the \nLord Mayor\u2019s Chapel in Bristol, was fl oored with \na unique group of almost 800 brightly decorated \ntiles from Seville, although it is not known if he or \nhis son Sir Frances, who was in charge of fi nishing \nthe chapel after his father\u2019s death, actually bought \nthe tiles. Sir Frances was also an agent in Spain \nand may have brought the tiles back with him.28 \nDirect purchase at source is at least one way of \nexplaining the presence of highly unusual pots and\/\nor extremely high quantities of imports at inland \nsites.29 Whether the acquisition and display of \nsuch exotics was seen as an opportunity to display \ncultural affi nities with the Spanish court in \nEngland (in a time of peace) is more diffi cult to \nprove archaeologically, although there is no doubt \nthat \u2018fashions\u2019 in interior decoration as much as in \nother aspects of life could be infl uenced by royal \npatronage.30 The use of Spanish lustrewares from \nMalaga in English households may have been \nintroduced to England with Queen Eleanor of \nCastile at the end of the 13th century, for example, \nand that of inlaid fl oor tiles with Eleanor of \nProvence in the middle of the same century.31 \nOn the other hand, one may well wonder \nwhat aesthetic attraction could possibly have been \nexerted by Portuguese coarsewares such as those \nat Upper Bugle Street with their red fabrics and \nundecorated surfaces, which were, after all, not \nunlike some of the plainer local pots. Could the \nshapes have added novelty to gentry tables? Or \ncould the shiny fl akes of mica really have been \nenough to attract purchasers and distinguish them \nvisually as being of a more exotic origin? It is \ncertainly true that, in spite of their plain appear-\nance, pots like these were much sought after by \nEuropean courts in the 16th century, becoming \npopular with the gentry class. Individual pieces \nwere collected and specially ordered by queens \nand kings from Portugal to Italy and Flanders, \nthe main attraction being not the colour but the \n\u2018excellent smell and taste\u2019 of the clay.32 The smaller \nvessels were used to serve water and kept it cool, \na quality which was especially sought after in \nwarmer Mediterranean climes, though whether \nthis was much appreciated in Britain is harder to \nsay. After drinking the water, ladies were given \nto biting the clay container, a custom common to \nboth Spain and Portugal. The eating of the tiny \ncontainer, such as that represented by Vel\u00e1zquez \nin Las Meninas, was widespread and even abused \nin some quarters, so much as that this \u2018vice\u2019 was \nleft to priests to moderate in the confessional by \nimposing days of abstinence.33 Surprised witnesses \nto this custom included French and Italian com-\nmentators who wrote home excusing these indul-\ngences as being due to the many properties of this \nparticular clay which could even cure illnesses.34 \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nPo\nst-\nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\n74 ALEJANDRA GUTI\u00c9RREZ\nTRADE \nAlthough of lesser economic importance than \nthat with France and Spain, English trade with \nPortugal was well established during the Middle \nAges and early modern period, cemented by good \npolitical relations throughout. Historical records \nshow that the Portuguese visited mainly South-\nampton, London and Bristol, and occasionally \nExeter too, bringing wine, dried fruit, olive oil, \noranges, dyes, cork, salt and sugar and returning \nmainly with cloth, together with tin and lead.35 \nEnglish merchants themselves also began to visit \nPortugal directly at the beginning of the 14th \ncentury, especially Lisbon and Porto. Importantly, \nexchange was not necessarily direct and it was this \nwhich secured the arrival of goods even at times \nof war or confl ict. Portuguese ships favoured \nFlanders, as well as other stop-over ports along the \ncoast of France, from where goods could have been \nre-exported to England, while Italians established \nin Portugal could also dispatch local goods aboard \nItalian vessels.36 These patterns of trade are further \ncomplicated once it is realized that Portuguese \nproducts which reached the north of England \nwere routinely re-distributed via France and the \nLow Countries,37 just as foreign goods could be \nfreighted out from main ports, such as Southamp-\nton and London, and then along the south coast to \nExeter and other English ports.38 Some of the pro-\nvincial ports, such as Plymouth, also re-directed \ngoods to London along the coast.39\nTRADE IN POTTERY\nThe assemblage from Upper Bugle Street therefore \npresents several diffi culties in its interpretation. \nGiven that it is unique both in the quantity and \ntype of forms found, the suspicion must be that it \nrepresents a cargo load of Portuguese pots, rather \nthan deriving from household occupation. This \nsuggestion is supported by unpublished data from \nthe city archives which refers to this tenement in \n1603 as \u2018the storehouse at the Biddles gate\u2019, com-\nprising \u2018loft, cellar and solar\u2019 and apparently rented \nout to merchants from that date onwards.40 The \ntenement was conveniently placed near the quay, \nin one of the main thoroughfares, and is already \nrecorded in the 15th century as a cellar.41 As well, \nthe recent discovery of a wreck off the Portuguese \ncoast near Aveiro (55km south of Oporto) shows \nthat Portuguese pottery was indeed transported by \nsea in unusual combinations.42 The cargo of this \nsmall boat contained around 200 pottery vessels, \nsome smaller forms found in situ still packed inside \nthe larger ones, and was dated by dendrochronol-\nogy to the middle of the 15th century. Included \nin the shipment were some familiar pottery types \nincluding sugar cones, costrels, small burnished \njugs, bowls, lebrillos and jars which seem to have \nchanged little in profi le until the 17th century. \nThere is thus good reason to suppose that the \nUpper Bugle Street assemblage represents a cargo \nwhich included not only containers like costrels \nbut also smaller forms such as bowls and small \njugs. The implication is that some coarseware \npottery from Portugal was being traded to \nEngland in its own right,43 although admittedly \nthe quantities do seem to have been small and their \ndistribution limited. This would explain why fi nds \nacross Britain are clearly linked to those southern \nports which maintained trade with Portugal and \nwhy fi nds of Portuguese coarsewares other than \ncostrels are rare inland.\nBut, if Portuguese pottery was being im ported, \nwhy was it not recorded? The most striking pottery \nof the medieval period imported into England, \nmainly from Spain but also from Italy, certainly \ndid attract the curiosity of customs offi cers on \narrival and, as a result, quantities arriving at the \nport were sometimes recorded. Problems in inter-\npreting these entries, prices and quantities have \nbeen the subject of a detailed study elsewhere.44 \nOverall, trade in Mediterranean pottery seems to \nhave been limited in Britain, especially in compari-\nson with later stonewares from northern Europe, \nwhich were mass produced and imported by the \nmillion. This was trade of a quite different charac-\nter: steady, voluminous, and widely distributed \nacross the country, saturating all levels of society \nfrom the middle of the 15th century onwards.45 \nBy contrast, Portuguese pottery like the \nMerida-type wares from Upper Bugle Street, was \nnever recorded in the port books, or at least in \na form that can now be readily identifi ed. Some \nawareness of where the pottery was made is recog-\nnized, however, in the entry for the \u2018green pan-\ncheon made in Portugal\u2019 that John Norton named \nin his 1568 will,46 but so far this is a unique refer-\nence in Southampton. It is quite possible that some \nof the entries of pots registered for Portuguese \nboats might refer to Portuguese pots, but their \norigin is not established in the documents. In 1584, \nfor example, three dozen \u2018earthen dishes\u2019 arrived at \nMilford in south Wales from Avero in Portugal,47 \nbut the production centre for the pottery was not \nknown or at least written down.\nTRADE IN SUGAR\nAnother intriguing aspect of the Southampton \nassemblage is the presence of sugar moulds. Sugar \narrived in England throughout the Middle Ages, \nand was fi rst imported from the Mediterranean \nand northern Africa (Barbary), and later from the \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nPo\nst-\nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\nPORTUGUESE COARSEWARES IN ENGLAND 75\nWest Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Pro-\nduction is attested in Spain before the 13th century, \nbut could only be exported northwards once \nMuslim power contracted in the Mediterranean \nand trade channels opened through the straits of \nGibraltar. Local production in Spain and Portugal \nsoon gave way to that in the Canary Islands and \nMadeira, especially the latter, and it was through \nexports from Madeira that Portuguese sugar came \nto dominate northern European ports.48 After a \nfew attempts in the 16th century, sugar refi ning \nonly took off in Britain in the middle of the 17th \ncentury.49 \nThe process of making sugar consisted of \ncrushing the canes between mill stones, then boil-\ning it in water, from which a sweet brown syrup \nwas obtained, the scum and dirt being extracted at \nintervals.50 The syrup was then poured into the \ncone-shaped pots, so shaped as to ease the collec-\ntion of the heavier molasses at the base of the pot. \nThe hole at the bottom of the mould was closed \nwith fl ax or some similar blocking and then opened \n\u2018after a week\u2019 when the sugar had crystallized and \ncould be separated from the molasses, which by \nnow had collected at the bottom of the mould. The \nmould was then placed in a small clay jar where the \nhole could be opened and the molasses drained out \nbelow, leaving a solid sugar \u2018loaf\u2019 above.51 \nSugar could be boiled up to three times to im-\nprove refi nement, the price varying accordingly.52 \nMerchandise books lists up to ten different \ntypes, including white, muscovado, mellis, refi ned \nand molasses, candy sugar being the most expen-\nsive.53 At least some of the sugar, including that \ncoming from Barbary and Brazil, was refi ned in \nEngland.54\nSugar is recorded in the port books as arriving \nin a variety of containers. Most references are to \n\u2018boxes\u2019 or \u2018cases\u2019 and \u2018barrels\u2019,55 but mention is also \nmade of sugar in pottes and in ollis, plainly some \nkind of pottery container. It is clear from later \nreferences that earthen \u2018sugar moulds\u2019 were re gu-\nlarly traded, a cargo of 1,060 of them arrived in \nPlymouth in 1594, for example,56 although it is not \nclear whether they were travelling full or empty, for \nuse in the refi ning process in England. \nTRADED PRODUCTS IN CONTAINERS\nIt is assumed that the costrels reached England \nas containers for Mediterranean products, and \ntherefore that they were acquired not for their \nown value as ceramics but for their content. Among \nthe goods documented as being exported from \nPortugal some could have travelled in pottery \ncontainers, especially oil, salt and wine. Salt was \nimported to England, mainly from France, but \nalso from Spain and Portugal. The request of \na Portuguese factor residing in Venice for 500 \ncantaros or jars of salt57 would suggest that at least \nsome salt could travel in pottery containers.\nUnfortunately, port books simply note quan-\ntities arriving and avoid any description of how \ngoods travelled or how they were packaged, but a \ncouple of exceptional archaeological fi nds can help \nmake up for this lack in the written records. One of \nthem is a Merida-type costrel from Carmarthen \nGreyfriars which was found to contain cinnabar, \na mercuric sulphide which produces a vermillion \npigment used in inks and paints.58 Dyes were \nfundamental for the local cloth industry and a wide \nselection were imported throughout the medieval \nperiod from the Mediterranean, including vegetal \ndyes, such as brazilwood, saffl ower, saffron, \nturmeric and woad, prestigious animal dyes like \nkermes, as well as mineral dyes such as indigo and \ncinnabar.59 \nAnother revealing fi nd is the Merida-type \ncostrel found in the cabin of the \u2018barber surgeon\u2019 \naboard the Mary Rose when the ship sunk in 1545. \nThis costrel was discovered inside a wooden chest \ntogether with surgical tools, syringes, wooden \ncanisters and German stoneware jugs full of oint-\nments and herbal remedies, such as peppercorns.60 \nGiven its fi ndspot, it seems probable that the costrel \nwould have contained some sort of vegetal or \nmineral product used by the apothecary. Those \nimported from the Mediterranean included \nmercury and treacle, both with medicinal applica-\ntions such as the treatment of skin diseases, includ-\ning the great pox, syphilis and colds.61 For lesser \nailments, such as sea-sickness, citrus fruits and \npomegranates, also from the Mediterranean, were \nrecommended, while wine could be used to wash \nand disinfect wounds.62 It is somewhat surprising \ntherefore that the costrel was found to contain \nPolypodium vulgare or polypody root extract mixed \nwith (possibly) milk; this fern extract would have \nbeen used in the treatment of \u2018melancholy\u2019, draw-\ning out \u2018fl eame and cholor\u2019.63 Unfortunately, as the \nplant is found widely across Europe, including \nboth Britain and Portugal, we cannot be sure if the \ncostrel had been reused by the surgeon to contain \none of his own remedies, in the same way as the \nGerman stoneware jugs also found in the chest, or \nif the mixture was made up in Portugal for export. \nThere is, however, little doubt that the costrel \narrived full when it reached England as, whatever \nthe contents, its still surviving stopper was made \nof cork oak from the Iberian Peninsula.64\nWhereas vermillion is recorded as arriving in \nEngland aboard Mediterranean boats, the fact that \nthe costrel aboard the Mary Rose had a possible \nsecondary use should remind us of the practical \nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) S\noc\niet\ny f\nor \nPo\nst-\nMe\ndie\nva\nl A\nrch\nae\nolo\ngy\n76 ALEJANDRA GUTI\u00c9RREZ\nfunction of imported containers, and that \u2014 at \nleast in some cases \u2014 rather than indicating a link \nwith some exotic southern product and a world \nof luxury, they were merely recycled everyday \nwares, good only so long as they lasted. It seems \nlikely that all these imported pots were selected \nspecifi cally by the \u2018barber surgeon\u2019. Probably the \nstonewares offered a resistant, durable and hard \ncontainer when compared against local earthen-\nware jugs, and their narrow necks allowed the \ncontents to be sealed easily,65 whereas the shape \nof the Merida-type costrel, easily closed with a \ncork, would have been ideal for storing a liquid \nremedy. \nCONCLUSION\nFinds of Merida-type coarsewares are few and \nfar across the country. Among this type of Por-\ntuguese pottery, the two-handled container or \ncostrel is the more commonly found, but they \nmay have been acquired for what they contained \nrather than for the value of the pot itself. As the \nMary Rose fi nd indicates, once their original \ncontents were exhausted, containers could then \nbe reused; so their presence on a site does not \nnecessarily imply imported Portuguese products. \nIn the search for explanations for particular \nfi ndspots, the national distribution of Merida-type \ncoarsewares also highlights the impact of personal \ncontacts on the material culture of any one site, \nparticularly in the case of Acton Court, and stres-\nses the value of historical research in the fl eshing \nout of details of ownership and occupancy. The \nmain conclusion to be drawn from this research, \nhowever, is that some trade in Portuguese coarse-\nwares certainly occurred with England. Although \nthe arrival of Portuguese pottery has gone largely \nunrecorded in documents, in contrast to other \nMediterranean pottery which was regularly traded, \nlarge groups of pottery imported from a single \nsource, such as that excavated at Upper Bugle \nStreet, may only be explained by these exceptional \ncircumstances and is best interpreted as a Portu-\nguese cargo. Whether this pottery entered South-\nampton directly or via Flanders and other ports \ncannot now be known, nor do we understand fully \nwhat motivated the purchase. Perhaps fi nancial \nrisk was to be spread widely by serving several \nintended markets, one for sugar moulds, another \nfor bowls and jars refl ecting European fashions. \nWhatever the case, when compared with the \nmovement of other Portuguese goods such as food-\nstuffs and manufactured goods (such as sugar, oil, \nspices and dyes), the contribution of pottery was \nseemingly marginal in economic terms.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nMy warmest thanks to Duncan Brown for \nallowing access to the pottery collection from \nSouthampton and for facilitating the study of \nthe material.
