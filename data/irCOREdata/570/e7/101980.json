Background. There has recently been some interest in the study of stage-\nstructured population models on lattices. The following model, which is of particular\nrelevance to the present paper, was derived and studied by Weng, Huang, and Wu [8]:\ndwj(t)\ndt\n=\n\u03bc\n2\u03c0\n\u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\nB\u03b1(j \u2212 k)b(wk(t\u2212 r)) +Dm [wj+1(t) + wj\u22121(t)\u2212 2wj(t)]\n\u2212 dmwj(t), t > 0, j \u2208 Z,(1.1)\nwhere j \u2208 Z := {0,\u00b11,\u00b12, . . .} are the integer nodes of an in\ufb01nite one-dimensional\nlattice. The r-dependent parameters \u03bc and \u03b1 are given by\n\u03bc = exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b r\n0\nd(a) da\n)\n, \u03b1 =\n\u222b r\n0\nD(a) da(1.2)\nwith d(a), D(a), and r de\ufb01ned below, and the function B\u03b1(l) in (1.1), which we shall\nsometimes refer to as the kernel, is given by\nB\u03b1(l) = 2e\u22122\u03b1\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\ncos(l\u03c9)e2\u03b1 cos\u03c9 d\u03c9.(1.3)\nIn their paper, Weng, Huang, and Wu [8] actually used the symbol \u03b2 for their kernel.\nHowever, it is important that their kernel should not be confused with the correspond-\ning kernel for a \ufb01nite lattice (which we are calling \u03b2 in this paper); thus we shall refer\nto the in\ufb01nite lattice kernel of Weng, Huang, and Wu as B.\nIn (1.1) the parameter r measures the time from birth until reaching maturity and\nwj(t) denotes the total number of adults (i.e., the total number of age at least r) in\nthe jth patch. The function b(\u00b7), which always satis\ufb01es b(0) = 0, is the birth function\n\u2217Received by the editors June 9, 2004; accepted for publication (in revised form) June 1, 2005;\npublished electronically January 27, 2006.\nhttp:\/\/www.siam.org\/journals\/sima\/37-5\/44441.html\n\u2020Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH,\nU.K. (s.gourley@surrey.ac.uk).\n1688\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL ON A LATTICE 1689\nand the constants Dm and dm are, respectively, the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient and death\nrate for the mature population.\nIn (1.2), the functions D(a) and d(a) are the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient and death rate\nfor the immature population. For the immature population these rates can depend\non age a, but for the mature population the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient and death rate must\nbe independent of age and they are taken as Dm and dm.\nWeng, Huang, and Wu [8] derived their model from the following von Foerster\ntype of equation:\n\u2202uj\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202uj\n\u2202a\n= D(a) [uj+1(t, a) + uj\u22121(t, a)\u2212 2uj(t, a)]\u2212 d(a)uj(t, a)(1.4)\nwith D(a) = Dm and d(a) = dm for a \u2265 r. Equation (1.4) incorporates a discrete\nrepresentation of di\ufb00usion. Von Foerster equations for the case of continuous space\nhave been considered also, in which case the Laplacian operator can be used to model\nFickian di\ufb00usion (see [4]). In (1.4), uj(t, a) is the density of age a at time t in the jth\npatch. Furthermore\nwj(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\nr\nuj(t, a) da.\nIn [8] the interest is mainly in the existence of travelling front solutions connecting two\ndistinct equilibria. The highly nontrivial matter of the stability of these fronts is also\ninvestigated. Gourley and Wu [3] continued the study in [8] by providing conditions\nunder which the population will go extinct, and conditions for the existence of periodic\ntravelling waves.\nThe aim of the present paper is to derive and study an equation analogous to (1.1)\nfor the case when the lattice is \ufb01nite, with the nodes being given by j = 1, 2, . . . , N .\nAs we shall see, the model changes in two main respects. The \ufb01rst is that the discrete\nrepresentation of di\ufb00usion will only be wj+1(t)+wj\u22121(t)\u22122wj(t) at \u201cinterior\u201d points of\nthe lattice (i.e., the nodes j = 2, 3, . . . , N\u22121) with a di\ufb00erent expression for the nodes\nj = 1 and j = N . We shall use the expression appropriate for an isolated lattice which\nindividuals cannot escape from or enter into; this is the analogy of the homogeneous\nNeumann problem (i.e., no \ufb02ux at boundaries) in the case of continuous space. The\nsecond and more complicated di\ufb00erence between the model of the present paper and\n(1.1) is that the term with the time delay assumes a rather di\ufb00erent appearance. The\nfunction B\u03b1(l) given by (1.3) is completely inappropriate for the case of a \ufb01nite lattice.\nAdditionally, as we shall see, in the case of a \ufb01nite lattice the time delay term no longer\nassumes a \u201cconvolution\u201d structure (i.e., depending on the lattice index through the\nvariables j \u2212 k and k with summation over k). This convolution formulation cannot\nallow for interactions with the endpoints of a \ufb01nite lattice and therefore is strictly for\nin\ufb01nite lattices only.\nThe derivation in [8] relies heavily on the fact that their lattice was in\ufb01nite (their\nderivation utilizes a discrete Fourier transform technique). For a \ufb01nite lattice a dif-\nferent model derivation is required and this will be the subject of the next section.\nA model on a \ufb01nite lattice similar to the one we propose in this paper was con-\nsidered in Smith and Thieme [7]. Their model has n patches each of which o\ufb00ers\na di\ufb00erent quality of life (the per capita reproduction rates, mortality rates, and\nmaturation delays can vary from patch to patch). Additionally their model permits\nindividuals to migrate from any one patch directly to any other. Their model assumes\n1690 Y. KYRYCHKO, S. A. GOURLEY, AND M. V. BARTUCCELLI\nthe form\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202a\n)\nuj(t, a) =\nn\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b3jkuk(t, a)\u2212\n(\nn\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b3kj + \u03bcj\n)\nuj(t, a)\nwith birth law\nuj(t, 0) = gj\n(\u222b \u221e\n\u03c4j\nuj(t, a) da\n)\n,\nwhere each gj is a bounded function. In some respects this model is more general\nthan the one we propose in this paper, particularly with regard to the migration terms\n(\u03b3jk is the per capita migration rate from node k to node j). Their key assumption\non the migration terms is that the matrix (\u03b3jk) be irreducible. Our model in this\npaper considers migration only on a nearest neighbor basis, but we study our model\nin somewhat more detail.\nOur approach is to start with an age-structured model (the \u201coriginal problem\u201d)\ngiven by system (2.1) below, and derive from it a delay di\ufb00erential equation system\n(the \u201creduced problem\u201d) for wj(t), the total mature population at the jth patch.\nAs we shall discover, the reduced system (system (2.10) below) is valid only after\na transient period of length r. For 0 < t < r the variable wj(t) is governed by\nsome di\ufb00erent nonautonomous equations that involve the initial data u0(a) for the\noriginal problem (2.1). We shall not be concerned in this paper with these other\nnonautonomous equations but will e\ufb00ectively neglect the transient phase and study\nthe reduced problem independently (i.e., we study system (2.10) below for t > 0, sub-\nject to (2.11)). However, there are delicate issues regarding initial data and positivity\nwhich will be discussed later in this paper and which are treated in more detail in\nBocharov and Hadeler [2] for problems without di\ufb00usion. For example, only certain\ninitial data for the reduced problem with delay are related to the original problem.\nAlso, while positive solutions of the original problem lead to positive solutions of the\nreduced problem, the cone of positive solutions of the reduced problem is larger in\ngeneral, since we study the reduced problem for arbitrary nonnegative initial data,\nand not just those initial data that are related to the original problem. These issues\nwill be discussed further as they arise.\n2. Finite lattice: Model derivation. Let uj(t, a) denote the density of the\npopulation of the species at the jth patch at time t \u2265 0 and age a \u2265 0. Let D(a) and\nd(a) denote the di\ufb00usion and death rates of the population at age a. Assume that the\npatches are located at the integer nodes j = 1, 2, . . . , N of a one-dimensional lattice\nand that spatial di\ufb00usion occurs only at the nearest neighborhood and is propor-\ntional to the di\ufb00erence of the densities of the population at adjacent patches. These\nassumptions lead to the model(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202a\n)\nu(t, a) = D(a)Au(t, a)\u2212 d(a)u(t, a)(2.1)\nfor t > 0, where\nu(t, a) = (u1(t, a), . . . , uN (t, a))\nT\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL ON A LATTICE 1691\nand\nA =\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u22121 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n1 \u22122 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 \u22122 1\n0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 1 \u22121\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 ,(2.2)\nsubject to\nuj(t, 0) = b(wj(t)),(2.3)\nwhere wj(t) is the total mature population at the jth patch, given by\nwj(t) =\n\u222b \u221e\nr\nuj(t, a) da(2.4)\nand b(\u00b7) is the birth function, which satis\ufb01es b(0) = 0. Furthermore, it is natural to\nassume that\nuj(t,\u221e) = 0, t \u2265 0, j = 1, . . . , N.\nThe initial data for (2.1) has the form\nu(0, a) = u0(a), 0 \u2264 a <\u221e(2.5)\nwith u0(a) prescribed.\nNote that, at the node j = 1, the di\ufb00usion term is D(a)(u2 \u2212 u1) with a similar\nexpression for the other \u201cend\u201d node j = N . In this way the model (2.1) has been\nset up so as to be the discrete analogue of what is commonly called the homogeneous\nNeumann problem in the continuous case, in which no-\ufb02ux boundary conditions are\napplied. For the heat equation ut = \u0394u on a \ufb01nite domain \u03a9 with homogeneous\nNeumann boundary conditions \u2202u\/\u2202n = 0 on \u2202\u03a9, it is well known that\n\u222b\n\u03a9\nu(t, x) dx\nis constant. An analogous result holds for (2.1) in the case when there are no births\nor deaths (i.e., b(\u00b7) = d(\u00b7) = 0). Indeed, in this case,\nd\ndt\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nuj(t, a) da\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\ntotal population\n=\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u2202uj(t, a)\n\u2202t\nda = \u2212\nN\u2211\nj=1\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u2202uj(t, a)\n\u2202a\nda\n+\nN\u22121\u2211\nj=2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nD(a)(uj\u22121(t, a)\u2212 2uj(t, a) + uj+1(t, a)) da\n+\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nD(a)(\u2212u1(t, a) + u2(t, a)) da+\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nD(a)(uN\u22121(t, a)\u2212 uN (t, a)) da\n= \u2212\nN\u2211\nj=1\n(uj(t,\u221e)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=0\n\u2212 b(wj(t))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=0 if no births\n) = 0.\nOur intention is to derive from (2.1), (2.3) a system of equations satis\ufb01ed by the\ntotal matured population wj(t), j = 1, 2, . . . , N . Before doing so, let us introduce the\n1692 Y. KYRYCHKO, S. A. GOURLEY, AND M. V. BARTUCCELLI\nfunction \u03b2(t, k, j) de\ufb01ned by\n\u03b2(t, k, j) =\n1\nN\n+\n2\nN\nN\u2211\nl=1\ne\u22124 sin\n2( l\u03c02N )t cos\n[\n(2j \u2212 1) l\u03c0\n2N\n]\ncos\n[\n(2k \u2212 1) l\u03c0\n2N\n]\n.(2.6)\nWe will prove the following result which is useful for later calculations.\nProposition 2.1. The function \u03b2(t, k, j) de\ufb01ned by (2.6) has the following prop-\nerties:\n(i) it satis\ufb01es\nd\ndt\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239d \u03b2(t, k, 1)...\n\u03b2(t, k,N)\n\u239e\n\u239f\u23a0 =\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u22121 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n1 \u22122 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 \u22122 1\n0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 1 \u22121\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239d \u03b2(t, k, 1)...\n\u03b2(t, k,N)\n\u239e\n\u239f\u23a0 ,(2.7)\n(ii) \u03b2(0, k, j) is the Kronecker delta:\n\u03b2(0, k, j) =\n{\n1 if j = k,\n0 if j \u0006= k;(2.8)\n(iii)\n\u2211N\nk=1 \u03b2(t, k, j) = 1 for each j = 1, 2, . . . , N and all t \u2265 0;\n(iv) \u03b2(t, k, j) > 0 for all t > 0 and all 1 \u2264 k, j \u2264 N .\nProof. Property (i) is straightforward. Property (ii) is fairly easily seen. Indeed,\n\u03b2(0, k, k) =\n1\nN\n+\n2\nN\nN\u2211\nl=1\ncos2(2k \u2212 1) l\u03c0\n2N\n=\n1\nN\n+\n1\nN\nN\u2211\nl=1\n(\n1 + cos(2k \u2212 1) l\u03c0\nN\n)\n=\n1\nN\n+ 1 +\n1\nN\nRe\n(\nN\u2211\nl=1\nei(2k\u22121)\nl\u03c0\nN\n)\n=\n1\nN\n+ 1 +\n2\nN\nRe\n(\nei(2k\u22121)\n\u03c0\nN\n1\u2212 ei(2k\u22121) \u03c0N\n)\n= 1\nafter some algebra. Similarly, \u03b2(0, k, j) = 0 for j \u0006= k.\nTo show statement (iii) it is clearly su\ufb03cient to prove that\nN\u2211\nk=1\ncos(2k \u2212 1) l\u03c0\n2N\n= 0\nand this is easily shown.\nFinally we prove (iv), that \u03b2(t, k, j) > 0 for all t > 0. We have already noted that\nthe function \u03b2(t, k, j) de\ufb01ned by (2.6) satis\ufb01es the system of di\ufb00erential equations\n(2.7) with the initial condition (2.8). Here, j is thought of as the spatial coordinate\nand k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , N} as \ufb01xed. Certain theorems in the theory of matrices (Berman\nand Plemmons [1]) are useful here. The matrix \u03b2(t) = [\u03b2(t, k, j)]N\u00d7N is the solution\nof the linear system \u03b2\u02d9 = A\u03b2, where A is the matrix de\ufb01ned by (2.2), subject to\n\u03b2(0) = I. Thus\n\u03b2(t) = eAt = e\u22123te(3I+A)t = e\u22123t\n\u221e\u2211\ni=0\nti(3I +A)i\ni!\n.\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL ON A LATTICE 1693\nIt is easily checked that 3I + A is a positive and irreducible matrix. Therefore, it\nfollows [1] that (3I + A)i is a strictly positive matrix for all i \u2265 N + 1. Therefore,\nfor any t > 0 the in\ufb01nite sum above furnishes a matrix all of whose elements are\nstrictly positive. Therefore, \u03b2(t, k, j) > 0 for all t > 0.

For 0 < t < r the variable wj(t) does not obey system (2.10) but\nis governed instead by some di\ufb00erent (nonautonomous) equations that still contain\ninformation about the initial data of the system (2.1). This issue is discussed in detail\nin Bocharov and Hadeler [2] for systems without di\ufb00usion. However, in this paper we\nshall concentrate on the problem consisting of system (2.10) for t > 0, subject to the\ninitial conditions\nwj(s) = w\n0\nj (s) \u2265 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , N, s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0](2.11)\nwith w0j (s) prescribed.\nRemark 2. Related to the above point, is the issue of initial data. If we solve\n(2.10) for t > 0 an important question arises: does an arbitrary nonnegative initial\nfunction w0j (s), s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0], necessarily result, in any sense, from an initial datum\nu0(a) for system (2.1)? The answer is, not necessarily. Given an initial datum u0(a)\nfor system (2.1), one should \ufb01rst evolve the variable wj(t) until time r according to\nthe nonautonomous equations which govern wj(t) for 0 < t < r, and then evolve\nwj(t) for t > r according to (2.10) with initial time r, using as initial data the values\nof wj(t), t \u2208 [0, r], found by solving the nonautonomous equations. Those functions\nwj(t), t \u2208 [0, r], which arise in this way are, once translated r units back in time, those\n1694 Y. KYRYCHKO, S. A. GOURLEY, AND M. V. BARTUCCELLI\nfunctions which are admissible in (2.11) as initial data for system (2.10) with initial\ntime 0. For a class of systems without di\ufb00usion, Bocharov and Hadeler [2] characterize\ncompletely those initial data for their delay equation starting at time r, which result\nfrom a positive initial datum of their analogy to our system (2.1). In this paper we\nshall not develop this issue further but will consider (2.10) for t > 0 subject only to\n(2.11) (i.e., as though the system had not been derived from a structured population\nmodel).\nProof of Theorem 2.2. Letting\nw(t) = (w1(t), . . . , wN (t))\nT ,\nwe have\ndw(t)\ndt\n=\n\u222b \u221e\nr\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nu(t, a) da =\n\u222b \u221e\nr\n[\n\u2212 \u2202\n\u2202a\nu(t, a) +D(a)Au(t, a)\u2212 d(a)u(t, a)\n]\nda.\n(2.12)\nWe obtain from (2.1) and (2.12) that\ndw(t)\ndt\n= u(t, r) +DmAw(t)\u2212 dmw(t) for t > 0.(2.13)\nIn order to have a complete system for wj(t) we need to calculate uj(t, r), j =\n1, 2, . . . , N . For \ufb01xed s \u2265 0 let Vs(t) = (V s1 (t), . . . , V sN (t))T , where\nV sj (t) = uj(t, t\u2212 s) for s \u2264 t \u2264 s+ r.(2.14)\nSince only the mature population can reproduce, we have\nV sj (s) = uj(s, 0) = b(wj(s)),(2.15)\nwhere b : R+ \u2192 R+ is the birth function. From (2.1), we have\nd\ndt\nVs(t) =\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n+\n\u2202\n\u2202a\n)\nu(t, a)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\na=t\u2212s\n= D(t\u2212 s)AVs(t)\u2212 d(t\u2212 s)Vs(t).(2.16)\nWe want to solve (2.16) subject to (2.15). First, let\nV sj (t) = V\u02dc\ns\nj (t)e\n\u2212 \u222b t\u2212s\n0\nd(z) dz\nand V\u02dcs(t) = (V\u02dc s1 (t), . . . , V\u02dc\ns\nN (t))\nT ; then system (2.16) becomes\nd\ndt\nV\u02dcs(t) = D(t\u2212 s)AV\u02dcs(t).\nMaking a further transformation of time t as\nt\u02dc =\n\u222b t\u2212s\n0\nD(z) dz\nso that dt\u02dc\/dt = D(t\u2212 s), we obtain\nd\ndt\u02dc\nV\u02dcs(t\u02dc) = AV\u02dcs(t\u02dc)(2.17)\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL ON A LATTICE 1695\nwhich has to be solved subject to the initial condition (2.15) in the form\nV\u02dc sj (0) = b(wj(s)), j = 1, 2, . . . , N.(2.18)\nWe look for a solution of (2.17) in the form\nV\u02dc sj (t\u02dc) =\nN\u2211\nk=1\nck\u03b2(t\u02dc, k, j),\nwhere the function \u03b2(t, k, j) is de\ufb01ned in (2.6) and ck are unknown constants to be\nfound using the initial condition (2.18). That is, with t\u02dc = 0 one gets\nV\u02dc sj (0) =\nN\u2211\nk=1\nck\u03b2(0, k, j) = cj ,\nby (ii) of Proposition 2.1. Consequently,\ncj = b(wj(s)),\nand the solution of the system (2.17) is given as follows:\nV\u02dc sj (t\u02dc) =\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(wk(s))\u03b2(t\u02dc, k, j),\nor, in terms of t,\nV\u02dc sj (t) =\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(wk(s))\u03b2\n(\u222b t\u2212s\n0\nD(z)dz, k, j\n)\n.\nHence,\nuj(t, t\u2212 s) = V sj (t) = e\u2212\n\u222b t\u2212s\n0\nd(z)dz\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(wk(s))\u03b2\n(\u222b t\u2212s\n0\nD(z)dz, k, j\n)\n.\nRecalling that s \u2265 0 we deduce that, for t \u2265 r,\nuj(t, r) = \u03bc\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(wk(t\u2212 r))\u03b2(\u03b1, k, j),(2.19)\nwhere b(wk(t)) is the birth function introduced above, and \u03bc and \u03b1 are given by (2.9).\nThus, the system for wj has the form (2.10) for t \u2265 r.\n3. Positivity of solutions. In the previous sections we derived the reduced\nmodel for wj(t) and proved various properties of \u03b2(t, k, j). Using the fact that\n\u03b2(t, k, j) > 0 for all t > 0 we shall now prove a positivity-preserving property for\nsystem (2.10).\nThe result which we shall prove in this section is for the system consisting of\nthe di\ufb00erential equations (2.10) for t > 0, supplemented by the initial data (2.11).\nAs noted previously, the reduced system (2.10) is actually only valid for t \u2265 r. For\n0 < t < r another nonautonomous system applies and governs wj(t). Thus there\n1696 Y. KYRYCHKO, S. A. GOURLEY, AND M. V. BARTUCCELLI\nis a subtle relationship between the original problem (2.1) and the reduced problem\n(2.10) as regards positivity. This issue is discussed in detail in [2] for systems without\ndi\ufb00usion, and the issues concerning positivity are basically the same for systems with\nand without di\ufb00usion.\nFirst, we consider the initial value problem\ndv(t)\ndt\n= DAv(t)\u2212 dv(t) + h(t),(3.1)\nwhere v(t) = (v1(t), . . . , vN (t))\nT and h(t) = (h1(t), . . . , hN (t))\nT , subject to\nvj(0) = cj , cj \u2208 R, j = 1, . . . , N.\nFrom the de\ufb01nition of \u03b2(t, k, j) it is easy to check that the solution to this problem is\nvj(t) = e\n\u2212dt\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b2(Dt, k, j)ck +\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u222b t\n0\ne\u2212d(t\u2212s)\u03b2(D(t\u2212 s), k, j)hk(s) ds, j = 1, . . . , N.\n(3.2)\nTherefore if cj \u2265 0 and hj(t) \u2265 0 for all t \u2265 0 and j = 1, . . . , N , then, since \u03b2(t, k, j) \u2265\n0, we have vj(t) \u2265 0 for all j = 1, . . . , N and t \u2265 0. We shall now prove that the\nsolutions of (2.10) enjoy positivity-preserving properties analogous to results that can\nbe proved using the strong maximum principle in the case of continuous space.\nTheorem 3.1. Let b(0) = 0 and b(w) > 0 when w > 0, and let {wj} be the\nsolution of system (2.10), t > 0, corresponding to the initial data wj(s) = w\n0\nj (s),\ns \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]. If w0j (s) \u2265 0 for all j = 1, . . . , N and s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0], then wj(t) \u2265 0 for all\nj = 1, . . . , N and t \u2265 0.\nAlso, if w0j (s) \u0006\u2261 0 on (s, j) \u2208 [\u2212r, 0] \u00d7 {1, 2, . . . , N}, then wj(t) > 0 for all\nj = 1, . . . , N and t \u2265 r.\nProof. We \ufb01rst prove the nonnegativity property wj(t) \u2265 0. This is achieved in\nsteps; we \ufb01rst prove the result for t \u2208 [0, r]. Applying (3.2) to system (2.10) with\nhj(t) = \u03bc\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, j)b(wk(t\u2212 r))\ngives, for t \u2208 [0, r],\nwj(t) = e\n\u2212dmt\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b2(Dmt, k, j)wk(0)(3.3)\n+ \u03bc\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u222b t\n0\ne\u2212dm(t\u2212s)\u03b2(Dm(t\u2212 s), k, j)\nN\u2211\nl=1\n\u03b2(\u03b1, l, k)b(wl(s\u2212 r)) ds.\nNow t \u2208 [0, r] so the right-hand side of the above expression refers only to the initial\ndata for wj(t), which is nonnegative by hypothesis. Since \u03b2 is nonnegative also, we\nconclude that wj(t) \u2265 0 for t \u2208 [0, r]. On the interval t \u2208 [r, 2r] an expression\nanalogous to (3.3) can easily be found, referring in its right-hand side to wj(\u00b7) only at\ntimes between 0 and r, on which interval we have just shown nonnegativity. Therefore,\nwj(t) \u2265 0 for t \u2208 [r, 2r]. This argument can be continued inde\ufb01nitely, and so we have\nshown wj(t) \u2265 0 for all t \u2265 0.\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL ON A LATTICE 1697\nWe now prove the second part of the theorem: strict positivity of wj(t) for all\nt \u2265 r, provided the initial data is not identically zero. From (3.3) we can infer that\nwj(r) > 0 for all j = 1, . . . , N.\nIndeed, if we had wj(r) = 0, then, since \u03b2(t, k, j) > 0 for t > 0 and since b(\u00b7) is positive\nde\ufb01nite, it would follow that wj(s) \u2261 0 on (s, j) \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]\u00d7 {1, 2, . . . , N}, contrary to\nhypothesis. For t \u2265 r an expression for wj(t) similar to (3.3) can be found, and from\nthis expression we can infer that, for t \u2265 r,\nwj(t) \u2265 e\u2212dm(t\u2212r)\nN\u2211\nk=1\n\u03b2(Dm(t\u2212 r), k, j)wk(r) > 0\nfor all j = 1, . . . , N . The proof of the theorem is complete.\n4. Comparison principle: Monotone birth functions. In this section we\nshall prove a comparison theorem for system (2.10) for the case when the birth func-\ntion is increasing, and we shall use it to prove that in this case if a positive uniform\nequilibrium solution exists, then it is globally stable. Theorem 4.1 below can also be\nestablished using results in Chapter 5 of Smith [6] (indeed, for increasing birth func-\ntions system (2.10) satis\ufb01es the quasimonotone condition on page 78 of [6], and (2.10)\nconstitutes a cooperative and irreducible system of functional di\ufb00erential equations).\nHowever, we will include a self-contained proof of our Theorem 4.1 here because, as\nwill become clear later, a detailed understanding of the monotone case throws much\nlight on how one can approach the case of a nonmonotone birth function which we do\nlater in Theorem 5.1.\nTheorem 4.1. Let the birth function b(w) be increasing and di\ufb00erentiable for\nall w \u2265 0 and let \u03b2(t, k, j) be given by (2.6). Let w\u00af(t) = (w\u00af1(t), . . . , w\u00afN (t))T and\nw\u02c6(t) = (w\u02c61(t), . . . , w\u02c6N (t))\nT be such that\ndw\u00af(t)\ndt\n\u2212DmAw\u00af(t) + dmw\u00af(t)\u2212 \u03bc\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(w\u00afk(t\u2212 r))\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, 1)\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, 2)\n...\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k,N \u2212 1)\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k,N)\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u2265 dw\u02c6(t)\ndt\n\u2212DmAw\u02c6(t) + dmw\u02c6(t)\u2212 \u03bc\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(w\u02c6k(t\u2212 r))\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, 1)\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, 2)\n...\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k,N \u2212 1)\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k,N)\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0(4.1)\nfor t > 0 and\nw\u00afj(s) \u2265 w\u02c6j(s), j = 1, . . . , N, s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0].\nThen w\u00afj(t) \u2265 w\u02c6j(t) for all t > 0 and j = 1, . . . , N .\n1698 Y.

We claim that Wj(t) \u2265 0 for all j = 1, . . . , N and\nt \u2208 [0, r]. Suppose this is false, i.e., that Wj(t) goes negative. Then Wj(t) must attain\na negative minimum on the set (t, j) \u2208 [0, r]\u00d7 {1, 2, . . . , N}. Let this happen at time\nt\u2217 and at the node j\u2217.

Convergence to equilibrium. In this section we will prove that if the\nbirth function b(w) is increasing and is such that there exists a uniform equilibrium\nsolution w\u2217 (independent of both j and t) to system (2.10) and is biologically realis-\ntic, then solutions of (2.10) approach the equilibrium w\u2217. Note \ufb01rst that a uniform\nequilibrium state w\u2217 must necessarily satisfy\n\u03bcb(w\u2217) = dmw\u2217.(4.4)\nWe will prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.2. In system (2.10) let the birth function b(w) satisfy b(0) = 0 and\nbe an increasing di\ufb00erentiable function for all w \u2265 0. Assume there exists w\u2217 > 0\nsuch that \u03bcb(w) > dmw when 0 < w < w\n\u2217 and \u03bcb(w) < dmw when w > w\u2217. Assume\nfurther that, in (2.11), w0j (s) \u0006\u2261 0 on (s, j) \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]\u00d7{1, 2, . . . , N}. Then the solution\nwj(t) of (2.10) for t > 0, subject to (2.11), satis\ufb01es wj(t) \u2192 w\u2217 as t \u2192 \u221e, for each\nj = 1, 2, . . . , N .\nProof. To prove this theorem we shall use Theorem 4.1. More speci\ufb01cally, we\nshall show using Theorem 4.1 that the solution wj(t) of (2.10) subject to (2.11) can\nbe bounded above and below by solutions of (2.10) that are functions of t only.\nIndeed, if we denote by w(t) any solution of the scalar equation\ndw(t)\ndt\n= \u03bcb(w(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmw(t),(4.5)\nthen the function\n(w1(t), w2(t), . . . , wN (t)) := (w(t), w(t), . . . , w(t))\nsatis\ufb01es (2.10). Two applications of Theorem 4.1 are required. In the \ufb01rst, we choose\nw\u02c6j(t) to be the solution wj(t) of (2.10) subject to (2.11) and w\u00afj(t) = w\u00af(t) for each j,\nwhere w\u00af(t) satis\ufb01es\ndw\u00af(t)\ndt\n= \u03bcb(w\u00af(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmw\u00af(t),\nw\u00af(s) = max{w0j (s), j = 1, 2, . . . , N} for s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0].\n(4.6)\nThen Theorem 4.1 yields\nwj(t) \u2264 w\u00af(t), t > 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , N.\nFor the second application of Theorem 4.1 the most obvious choices are to take w\u00afj(t)\nas the solution wj(t) of (2.10) subject to (2.11) and, for each j, w\u02c6j(t) = w\u02c6(t) where\nw\u02c6(t) satis\ufb01es\ndw\u02c6(t)\ndt\n= \u03bcb(w\u02c6(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmw\u02c6(t),\nw\u02c6(s) = min{w0j (s), j = 1, 2, . . . , N} for s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]\n(4.7)\nso that\nwj(t) \u2265 w\u02c6(t), t > 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , N,\n1700 Y. KYRYCHKO, S. A. GOURLEY, AND M. V. BARTUCCELLI\nbut this presents a possible problem in that w\u02c6(s) could be zero on all of s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]\nwithout violating the assumption w0j (s) \u0006\u2261 0 on (s, j) \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]\u00d7 {1, 2, . . . , N} (e.g., if\nw0j (s) were zero for all s on one particular node) in which case w\u02c6(t) would be zero for\nall t > 0, which is not helpful for us. The way round this di\ufb03culty is to remember\nthat we showed earlier (Theorem 3.1) that wj(t) > 0 for all t \u2265 r. Consider the initial\nvalue problem starting at time t = 2r and consisting of equation (2.10) for t > 2r, with\ninitial data taken to be the solution wj(t), t \u2208 [r, 2r], of the original problem. The\nsolution of this new initial value problem for t > 2r is clearly the same as the solution\nwj(t) of the original problem, but the new problem has strictly positive initial data.\nThis means that, without loss of generality, the minimum in (4.7) can be assumed to\nbe strictly positive for all s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0].\nTo complete the proof of Theorem 4.2 it therefore su\ufb03ces to prove that every\nsolution of the scalar ODE (4.5) such that w(s) > 0 for all s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0] will satisfy\nw(t) \u2192 w\u2217, if the hypotheses on the parameters and the function b(w) are satis\ufb01ed.\nThis follows immediately from Theorem 9.1 on page 159 of the book by Kuang [9].\nTherefore, the proof of Theorem 4.2 is complete.\n5. Nonmonotone birth functions. Of considerable interest to ecologists, is\nthe case of a birth function b(w) which is increasing up to a certain value of w and de-\ncreasing thereafter (for example, a function qualitatively resembling b(w) = Pwe\u2212Aw).\nSuch birth functions are important in modelling certain insect populations in which\nthe birth rate is observed to be roughly proportional to the number of adults if the\nnumber of adults is small, but e\ufb00ectively zero if the number of adults is large, since\ncompetition for resources then becomes so intense that the adults require all their\nresources for their own maintenance. The aims of this section are to establish a\ncomparison principle that works for very general birth functions, and then to use\nthe comparison principle to prove convergence theorems in the case when the birth\nfunction qualitatively resembles b(w) = Pwe\u2212Aw.\nTheorem 5.1. Let the birth function b(w) be a di\ufb00erentiable function for all\nw \u2265 0 and satisfy b(0) = 0, b(w) > 0 when w > 0. Let w\u02c6 and w\u00af be a pair of sub- and\nsupersolutions for (2.10), (2.11), i.e., a pair of functions satisfying\n(i) w\u02c6j(t) \u2264 w\u00afj(t) for all t \u2208 [\u2212r,\u221e), j = 1, 2, . . . , N ;\n(ii) letting w\u00af(t) = (w\u00af1(t), . . . , w\u00afN (t))\nT and w\u02c6(t) = (w\u02c61(t), . . . , w\u02c6N (t))\nT for t > 0\nand j = 1, 2, . . . , N ,\ndw\u02c6(t)\ndt\n\u2264 DmAw\u02c6(t)\u2212 dmw\u02c6(t) + \u03bc\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(\u03d5k(t\u2212 r))\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, 1)\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, 2)\n...\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k,N \u2212 1)\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k,N)\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 ,\n(5.1)\nand\ndw\u00af(t)\ndt\n\u2265 DmAw\u00af(t)\u2212 dmw\u00af(t) + \u03bc\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(\u03d5k(t\u2212 r))\n\u239b\n\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, 1)\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k, 2)\n...\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k,N \u2212 1)\n\u03b2(\u03b1, k,N)\n\u239e\n\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0(5.2)\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL ON A LATTICE 1701\nfor all functions \u03d5j(t) such that w\u02c6j(t) \u2264 \u03d5j(t) \u2264 w\u00afj(t), t \u2208 [\u2212r,\u221e), j =\n1, 2, . . . , N ;\n(iii) w\u02c6j(s) \u2264 w0j (s) \u2264 w\u00afj(s), s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0], j = 1, 2, . . . , N , where w0j (s) is the initial\ndata for (2.10).\nThen the solution wj(t) of (2.10), (2.11) satis\ufb01es\nw\u02c6j(t) \u2264 wj(t) \u2264 w\u00afj(t) for all t > 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , N.\nProof.

In inequality (5.4), for each j choose \u03d5j(t) to be any\nfunction between w\u02c6j(t) and w\u00afj(t), t \u2208 [\u2212r,\u221e), which is such that \u03d5j(s) = w0j (s) when\ns \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]. From this choice for \u03d5j(t) we infer that, for t \u2208 (0, r] only, the last term in\nthe left-hand side of inequality (5.4) is zero, so that the inequality holds for t \u2208 (0, r]\nwith just the \ufb01rst three terms in the left-hand side. The proof that Wj(t) \u2265 0 for\nt \u2208 (0, r] then proceeds the same way as in the proof of Theorem 4.1 because our\ninequality is the same as (4.3) in the case when the functions fi(t) of the latter are\nzero.\nProving that wj(t) \u2264 w\u00afj(t) for t \u2208 (0, r] and all j is similar. Thus\nw\u02c6j(t) \u2264 wj(t) \u2264 w\u00afj(t) for t \u2208 (0, r], j = 1, 2, . . . , N.(5.5)\n1702 Y. KYRYCHKO, S. A. GOURLEY, AND M. V.

Inequality (5.4) still\nholds for all t > 0 and in particular for t \u2208 (r, 2r]. This time, we choose \u03d5j(t) to be any\nfunction between w\u02c6j(t) and w\u00afj(t), t \u2208 [\u2212r,\u221e), which is such that \u03d5j(t) = wj(t) when\nt \u2208 [0, r]. This choice furnishes for us inequality (5.4), on t \u2208 (r, 2r] only, but without\nthe term involving summation. We thus conclude that Wj(t) \u2265 0 for t \u2208 (r, 2r] and\nit is clear how to continue the proof.\nRemark. A comparison theorem similar to Theorem 5.1 was proved for the case\nof continuous space by Redlinger [5].\n5.1. Convergence to equilibrium when w\u2217 < wmax. We will use Theo-\nrem 5.1 to establish, essentially, that if b(w) qualitatively resembles Pwe\u2212Aw and if\na nonzero equilibrium of (2.10) exists, is unique, and is in the interval of w for which\nb(w) is increasing, then the equilibrium is globally stable as a solution of (2.10).\nTheorem 5.2. In system (2.10) let the birth function b(w) satisfy b(0) = 0\nand b(w) > 0 when w > 0. Also, let b(w) be increasing for 0 < w < wmax, with\nb\u2032(wmax) = 0, and decreasing for w > wmax. Assume further that there exists w\u2217 > 0\nsuch that \u03bcb(w) > dmw when 0 < w < w\n\u2217 and \u03bcb(w) < dmw when w > w\u2217, and\nassume that w\u2217 < wmax.\nThen, if w0j (s) \u0006\u2261 0 on (s, j) \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]\u00d7{1, 2, . . . , N}, the solution wj(t) of (2.10)\nfor t > 0, subject to (2.11), satis\ufb01es wj(t)\u2192 w\u2217 as t\u2192\u221e, for each j = 1, 2, . . . , N .\nRemark. The situation we have in mind is shown in Figure 1.\nProof of Theorem 5.2.

Convergence to equilibrium when w\u2217 > wmax. This section will show\nthat if w\u2217 > wmax, then solutions of (2.10), (2.11) will still converge to w\u2217 if additional\nconditions hold. These additional conditions will hold if w\u2217 is not too much larger\nthan wmax.\nTheorem 5.3. In system (2.10) let the birth function b(w) satisfy b(0) = 0\nand b(w) > 0 when w > 0. Also, let b(w) be increasing for 0 < w < wmax, with\nb\u2032(wmax) = 0, and decreasing for w > wmax.

It is natural to question whether these hypotheses can be satis\ufb01ed. The\ngraph shown in Figure 2 shows that they can, and also suggests that the hypotheses\nare likely to be satis\ufb01ed only when w\u2217 is not too much greater than wmax.\nThe notation b\u22121(b(w\u2217))|[0,wmax] requires some explaining. Under the assumptions\non b(w), b\u22121(w) will, if de\ufb01ned, have in general two values. Thus b\u22121(b(w\u2217)) is either\nw\u2217 or a value in [0, wmax] and b\u22121(b(w\u2217))|[0,wmax] means the latter value.\nProof of Theorem 5.3. Let us de\ufb01ne\nw0max = max{w\u2217,max{w0j (s), j = 1, 2, . . . , N, s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]}},\nw0min = min{w\u2217,min{w0j (s), j = 1, 2, . . . , N, s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0]}}.\nWe can assume without loss of generality that w0min > 0 (this can be justi\ufb01ed similarly\nto the proof of Theorem 4.2).\nThe proof begins with the observation that (w\u02c6j(t), w\u00afj(t)) = (0, V1(t)) is a sub\/\nsupersolution pair for (2.10), (2.11), where V1(t) satis\ufb01es\ndV1(t)\ndt\n= \u03bcb(wmax)\u2212 dmV1(t),\nV1(s) = w\n0\nmax, s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0].\nTherefore,\nlim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\nmax\nj\u2208{1,2,...,N}\nwj(t) \u2264 lim\nt\u2192\u221eV1(t) =\n\u03bcb(wmax)\ndm\n.\nNext it is easy to see that (v1, V1) is a sub\/supersolution pair, where V1 is the above\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL ON A LATTICE 1705\nfunction and v1 satis\ufb01es\ndv1\ndt\n= \u03bcmin {b(v1(t\u2212 r)), b(V1(t\u2212 r))} \u2212 dmv1(t),\nv1(s) = w\n0\nmin, s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0].\n(5.9)\nInequality (5.7) assures us that the solution of\ndv\ndt\n= \u03bcb(v(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmv(t)\nwith positive initial data satis\ufb01es limt\u2192\u221e v(t) = w\u2217. This follows from Theorem 9.5\nin Kuang (see [9, page 165]). On the other hand, any solution of\ndv\ndt\n= \u03bcb(V1(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmv(t)\nsatis\ufb01es\nlim\nt\u2192\u221e v(t) =\n\u03bc\ndm\nb\n(\n\u03bcb(wmax)\ndm\n)\n.\nTherefore the solution v1(t) of (5.9) tends, as t \u2192 \u221e, to either w\u2217 or \u03bcdm b(\n\u03bcb(wmax)\ndm\n)\nand so our proof proceeds by considering two cases.\nCase 1. limt\u2192\u221e v1(t) = w\u2217. In this case we obtain immediately that\nlim inf\nt\u2192\u221e minj\u2208{1,2,...,N}\nwj(t) \u2265 w\u2217.\nIt can be shown similarly that\nlim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\nmax\nj\u2208{1,2,...,N}\nwj(t) \u2264 w\u2217,\ncompleting the proof of the theorem for Case 1.\nCase 2. limt\u2192\u221e v1(t) = \u03bcdm b(\n\u03bcb(wmax)\ndm\n). What we initially get in this case is\nlim inf\nt\u2192\u221e minj\u2208{1,2,...,N}\nwj(t) \u2265 \u03bc\ndm\nb\n(\n\u03bcb(wmax)\ndm\n)\n,\nwhich, by (5.6), strictly exceeds wmax. Therefore, for t su\ufb03ciently large, wj(t) > wmax.\nSince the problem has \ufb01nite delay, this further means that for t su\ufb03ciently large there\nis no history of wj(t) ever having assumed values below wmax, so that for the remainder\nof the proof b(w) can be treated as decreasing in w. In fact we may shift the origin of\ntime such as to assume, without loss of generality, that w0min > wmax. With this fact in\nmind, our proof now proceeds by successive re\ufb01nement of pairs of sub\/supersolutions.\nIn general, for each n = 2, 3, . . . , let (vn, Vn) be de\ufb01ned by\ndvn\ndt\n= \u03bcb(Vn\u22121(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmvn,\ndVn\ndt\n= \u03bcb(vn\u22121(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmVn\n(5.10)\n1706 Y. KYRYCHKO, S. A. GOURLEY, AND M. V. BARTUCCELLI\nwith the initial conditions Vn(s) = w\n0\nmax, s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0], and vn(s) = w0min, s \u2208 [\u2212r, 0].\nWe will show that (vn, Vn) is a sub\/supersolution pair for each n = 2, 3, . . . . According\nto Theorem 5.1, what we need to show is that\nb(Vn\u22121(t\u2212 r)) \u2264\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(\u03d5k(t\u2212 r))\u03b2(\u03b1, k, j)\nwhenever \u03d5j(t) is such that vn(t) \u2264 \u03d5j(t) \u2264 Vn(t) for j = 1, 2, . . . , N and t \u2208 [\u2212r,\u221e).\nSince we are now working in an interval of w in which b(w) is decreasing, it is enough\nto establish that\nb(Vn\u22121(t\u2212 r)) \u2264\nN\u2211\nk=1\nb(Vn(t\u2212 r))\u03b2(\u03b1, k, j) = b(Vn(t\u2212 r))\nand the latter is true if Vn(t) \u2264 Vn\u22121(t) for each n = 2, 3, . . . . Similarly, we need to\nshow that vn(t) \u2265 vn\u22121(t) for each n. In fact, we shall show by induction that\nv1(t) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 vn\u22121(t) \u2264 vn(t) < w\u2217 < Vn(t) \u2264 Vn\u22121(t) \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2264 V1(t).(5.11)\nTo achieve this we assume (5.11) and prove that\nw\u2217 < Vn+1(t) \u2264 Vn(t)(5.12)\nand\nw\u2217 > vn+1(t) \u2265 vn(t).(5.13)\nWe will prove only (5.12). Now\ndVn+1(t)\ndt\n= \u03bcb(vn(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmVn+1(t)\n\u2264 \u03bcb(vn\u22121(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmVn+1(t).\nTherefore\ndVn+1(t)\ndt\n+ dmVn+1(t) \u2264 dVn(t)\ndt\n+ dmVn(t),\nor, equivalently,\nd\ndt\n(Vn+1 \u2212 Vn)(t) + dm(Vn+1 \u2212 Vn)(t) \u2264 0.\nTherefore\nVn+1(t)\u2212 Vn(t) \u2264 (Vn+1(0)\u2212 Vn(0))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=0\ne\u2212dmt\nand so\nVn+1(t) \u2264 Vn(t).\nAlso\ndVn+1(t)\ndt\n= \u03bcb(vn(t\u2212 r))\u2212 dmVn+1(t)\n\u2265 \u03bcb(w\u2217)\u2212 dmVn+1(t)\n= dm(w\n\u2217 \u2212 Vn+1)\nSTAGE-STRUCTURED POPULATION MODEL ON A LATTICE 1707\nso that\nd\ndt\n(Vn+1 \u2212 w\u2217) \u2265 \u2212dm(Vn+1 \u2212 w\u2217).\nTherefore,\nVn+1(t)\u2212 w\u2217 \u2265 (Vn+1(0)\u2212 w\u2217)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u22650\ne\u2212dmt \u2265 0\nand so\nVn+1(t) \u2265 w\u2217\nwhich establishes (5.12).\nDenote V \u2217n = limt\u2192\u221e Vn(t) and v\n\u2217\nn = limt\u2192\u221e vn(t). That these limits exist follows\nfrom (5.10) and an inductive argument. We know v1(t) and V1(t) approach limits as\nt\u2192\u221e. There are theories of asymptotically autonomous di\ufb00erential equations which\nallow us to let t \u2192 \u221e in system (5.10), with n = 2, giving an autonomous system\nof di\ufb00erential equations from which it becomes clear that v2(t) and V2(t) approach\nlimits as t\u2192\u221e. The argument can be continued and we thus conclude the existence\nof the limits as t\u2192\u221e for each n. From (5.10) these limits satisfy\n\u03bcb(V \u2217n\u22121) = dmv\n\u2217\nn,\n\u03bcb(v\u2217n\u22121) = dmV\n\u2217\nn .\n(5.14)\nWe de\ufb01ne V \u2217 = limn\u2192\u221e V \u2217n and v\n\u2217 = limn\u2192\u221e v\u2217n; then (5.14) reduces to a limiting\nsystem\n\u03bcb(V \u2217) = dmv\u2217,\n\u03bcb(v\u2217) = dmV \u2217.\n(5.15)\nThese equations imply that V \u2217 = v\u2217 = w\u2217 (condition (5.8) assures us that they have\nno other solutions). Therefore, limt\u2192\u221e wj(t) = w\u2217 and the proof of the theorem is\ncomplete.\n6. Discussion. The main results in this paper are, \ufb01rst, the derivation of the\nmodel (2.10) itself, which is nontrivial and substantially di\ufb00erent from the case of\nan in\ufb01nite lattice considered previously in [8]. Second, the positivity-preservation\nproperties of solutions which turn out to be analogous to results that can be proved\nusing the strong maximum principle in the case of continuous space. Third, the\ncomparison principle of section 4 for the case of increasing birth functions. Fourth,\nthe use of this comparison principle to prove that the positive equilibrium of system\n(2.10), if feasible, is globally asymptotically stable for increasing birth functions. Fifth,\nin section 5, the comparison principle for the case of nonmonotone birth functions is\nproved. With the help of this principle we have shown that the nontrivial equilibrium\nis globally asymptotically stable if it is in the interval of w for which the birth function\nb(w) is increasing, and that it can remain globally stable if it is larger, but not\ntoo much larger, than the value of w at which b(w) attains its maximum, assuming\nadditionally the delay is not too large.\n1708 Y.
