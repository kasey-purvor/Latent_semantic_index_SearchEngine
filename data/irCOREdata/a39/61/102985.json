The role of ghrelin in nutritional recovery after non-gastrointestinal\nmajor surgery is unknown. We used coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as an example of\nanticipated good recovery post major surgery.\nSeventeen patients undergoing CABG (mean \u00b1 SEM: 70.1 \u00b1 2.2 yrs, BMI 29.1 \u00b1 1.4 kg\/m2, 15 male)\nunderwent fasting and postprandial (45 mins after standard test breakfast) blood sampling pre-\noperatively (day 0), post-operatively (day 6) and at follow-up (day 40). Changes in food intake,\nbiochemical and anthropometric markers of nutritional status were recorded. A comparison was\nmade to 17 matched healthy controls (70.6 \u00b1 2.3 yrs, BMI 28.4 \u00b1 1.3 kg\/m2).\nWe observed significantly increased post-operative and follow-up fasting ghrelin concentrations\ncompared with pre-operatively (pre-op. 402 \u00b1 42 pmol\/L vs post-op. 642 \u00b1 97 pmol\/L vs follow-\nup 603 \u00b1 94 pmol\/L) (ANOVA p < 0.05). Significantly exaggerated postprandial suppression of\nghrelin was seen postoperatively and continued until follow-up (\u2206 pre-op. 10 \u00b1 51 pmol\/L vs \u2206\npost-op. -152 \u00b1 43 pmol\/L vs \u2206 follow-up -159 \u00b1 65 pmol\/L, p < 0.05). This was associated with a\n50% reduction in food intake {post-op. 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 MJ\/D (1076 \u00b1 120 kcal\/D) compared with\nestimated requirements 9.9 \u00b1 0.5 MJ\/D (2366 \u00b1 120 kcal\/D)}, leading to a 4% weight loss and a 5%\nreduction in muscle arm circumference loss over length of follow up.\nOur data support the hypothesis that prolonged changes in fasting and postprandial plasma ghrelin\nconcentrations are associated with impaired nutritional recovery after CABG. These findings\nreinforce the need to investigate ghrelin in other patients groups undergoing major surgery.\nPublished: 8 October 2007\nNutrition & Metabolism 2007, 4:20 doi:10.1186\/1743-7075-4-20\nReceived: 25 May 2007\nAccepted: 8 October 2007\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.nutritionandmetabolism.com\/content\/4\/1\/20\n\u00a9 2007 Nematy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition & Metabolism 2007, 4:20 http:\/\/www.nutritionandmetabolism.com\/content\/4\/1\/20Findings\nMalnutrition remains a largely unrecognised problem in\nhospitalised patients [1]. Moreover delayed nutritional\nrecovery after routine surgery is also under-appreciated.\nPeptide hormones released from the gut have been\nreported to affect appetite and may play a role in the\naltered food consumption of patients [2]. Ghrelin, a 28\namino acid peptide, is produced by the stomach, regulates\nthe initiation of feeding, and its level is highest in the fast-\ning state, falling within one hour of a meal [3].\nThe dynamic response of this hormone in patients who\nundergo major surgery, for example CABG is unknown. In\nthis study we hypothesised that the driving mechanism\nfor decreased energy intake and weight loss in surgical\npatients may be abnormal ghrelin concentrations.\nWe undertook a prospective clinical cohort study in the\nDepartment of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Hammersmith\nHospital, London UK over a 6 month period. Local\nresearch ethics committee approval was obtained for the\nenrolment of both patients and control subjects (05\/\nQ0406\/16); written informed consent was also obtained.\nThe study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki\nDeclaration of 1975 as revised in 1983. Inclusion criteria\nwere patients aged greater than 50 years who were sched-\nuled for an elective CABG procedure. Exclusion criteria\nincluded those requiring urgent revascularisation,\nadvanced renal failure, heart failure and severe chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with weight loss.\nHealthy control volunteers matched for age and body\nmass index (BMI) were recruited by local advertisement.\nAll CABG patients underwent fasting and postprandial\n(45 mins after the start of standard test breakfast) blood\nsampling pre-operatively (day 0), post-operatively (day 6)\nand at follow up (day 40). The vulnerability of CABG\npatients, blood loss postoperatively, and ethical issues\nrestricted us to just one postprandial blood sample. The\n45 mins time point was used as this has previously been\nshown to represent the marked nadir in ghrelin [4-6].\nThe standard test breakfast consisted of 2.76 MJ (660 kcal)\n(17% protein, 54% carbohydrate and 29% fat) (Ensure\nPlus, Abbott Nutrition). 15\/17 consumed all of the test\nbreakfast on each occasion, 2 patients consumed 75%.\nControl subjects visited the hospital on 3 separate occa-\nsions to undergo fasting blood samples. On the third visit\nthey also consumed a test breakfast as above.\nConcentrations of plasma ghrelin immunoreactivity were\nmeasured using an established in-house radioimmu-\nnoassay as described previously [5]. The assay detected\nchanges of 25 pmol\/l of plasma ghrelin with a 95% confi-\ndence limit. The intra-and interassay coefficient of varia-\ntion were 5.5 and 10.1 %, respectively[6]. Appetite, food\nintake, anthropometric and biochemical indices were col-\nlected. Patients and controls were asked to complete a vis-\nual analogue scale (VAS) for appetite before and 45 min\nfollowing each test meal [7]. A 3-day dietary intake was\nrecorded post operation (between days 4\u20136) and prior to\nthe follow up visit. Estimated energy requirements were\nused to compare the total energy intake of patients in hos-\npital and at follow-up visits with their estimated nutri-\ntional requirements [8,9]. Healthy control subjects also\ncompleted a 3-day dietary record. Food intake data were\nanalysed using Dietplan 6 (Forrest Hill Software Ltd, Sus-\nsex, UK). Mid arm circumference (MAC) and body weight\nwere assessed pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at fol-\nlow-up [10,11]. Albumin, protein, C-reactive protein\n(CRP), and haemoglobin concentrations were extracted\nfrom the patient records.\nA power calculation based on a previous study using a\npower of 80% and alpha 5% suggested a sample size of 7\npatients matched to 7 controls would be sufficient to\nshow significant changes between patients and control\nsubjects (mean difference 414 pmol\/l and standard devi-\nation 248). The data were analysed using SPSS 13.0 for\nwindows (SPSS Science, Apache Software Foundation,\nChicago, IL, USA).\nAll data were checked for normality and presented as\nmean plus minus standard error of the mean (SEM). Sim-\nple or repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nwas used for multiple comparison testing; where appro-\npriate, post hoc testing was performed using Dunnett and\nNewmans-Keuls's test respectively. In all cases, p < 0.05\nwas considered to be statistically significant.\nSeventeen CABG patients completed the study (mean \u00b1\nSEM: age 70.1 \u00b1 2.2 yrs, BMI 29.1 \u00b1 1.4 kg\/m2, 15 male).\nPatients were compared with matched control volunteers\n(70.6 \u00b1 2.3 yrs, BMI 28.4 \u00b1 1.3 kg\/m2, 15 male). There was\nno difference in fasting plasma ghrelin concentrations\nbetween CABG pre-operatively and controls (Figure 1).\nWe observed an increase in post-operative fasting ghrelin\nconcentration compared with pre-operatively. Our data\nalso revealed an exaggerated postprandial suppression of\nghrelin concentrations postoperatively and at follow-up,\nbut not pre-operatively nor in control subjects (Figure 1).\nAlthough VAS indicated patients postoperatively reported\na higher fasting hunger rating than controls (postop. 38 \u00b1\n5 mm vs follow-up 45 \u00b1 8 mm vs controls 23 \u00b1 3 mm P =\n0.02 and p = 0.008 respectively), they had greater post-\nprandial appetite suppression compared to controls.\nMean daily energy intake on day 6 was 50% lower in\nCABG patients compared to their estimated energyPage 2 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition & Metabolism 2007, 4:20 http:\/\/www.nutritionandmetabolism.com\/content\/4\/1\/20requirement {4.5 \u00b1 0.5 MJ\/D (1076 \u00b1 120 kcal\/D) vs\nrequirements 9.9 \u00b1 0.5 MJ\/D (2366 \u00b1 120 kcal\/D) p <\n0.001)} and compared with healthy control subjects {4.5\n\u00b1 0.5 MJ\/D (1076 \u00b1 120 kcal\/D) vs 10.21 \u00b1 0.92 MJ\/D\n(2440 \u00b1 220 kcal\/D) p < 0.001}. At follow-up patients still\ndid not meet all of their energy requirements; they had a\n1.73 MJ (413 kcal) lower daily energy intake than their\nestimated energy requirements, or 2.17 MJ (519 kcal)\nlower daily energy intake than control subjects. There was\na 4% weight loss and a 5% decrease in MAC from pre-\noperatively to follow-up, (p < 0.005 and p < 0.008 respec-\ntively). Post-operatively patients had lower albumin, total\nprotein, and haemoglobin and also higher CRP compared\nwith pre-operatively (p < 0.0001). This returned to normal\non day 40 at follow-up visit (data not shown).\nThis is the first report to observe a describe in fasting\nplasma ghrelin concentrations post-operatively and exag-\ngerated ghrelin suppression following a test meal in CABG\npatients, despite pre-prandial appetite being preserved.\nExogenous ghrelin administration has been shown to\nincrease hunger and food intake [12]. Thus our data are\nconsistent with an increase initial motivation for food\npostoperatively that was supported by the VAS data. Our\ndata reveal an exaggerated postprandial suppression of\nghrelin postoperatively, and at follow-up compared to\npre-operatively, which would be expected to be associated\nwith a reduced food intake [5]. The exaggerated ghrelin\nsuppression may be responsible for a reduced drive to eat\nduring meal times, or early satiety. Although ghrelin can\nbe considered as a participant in food intake and body-\nweight regulation, its role in acute illness is not yet fully\nunderstood. It is uncertain whether older individuals with\nsignificant underlying medical problems would also\nadapt appropriately to acute weight loss [13-15].\nResults from various recent studies in healthy subjects\npropose that ghrelin may play a role in appetite regula-\ntion. Cummings et al. studied the pattern of plasma ghre-\nlin concentrations over 24 hours. Levels rose by an\naverage of 78% 1\u20132 h before the onset of each meal, and\nfell to nadir levels within 1 h after food was first con-\nsumed, suggesting that ghrelin concentrations decline\nquickly after each meal, returning to pre-meal concentra-\ntions before the next meal is initiated[3]. Intravenous\ninfusions of ghrelin in healthy human volunteers were\nalso shown to enhance subjectively-rated appetite and to\nincrease energy intake [12]. Furthermore, diurnal rhythms\nin ghrelin concentrations before and after weight loss\nwere in accord with diurnal rhythms in appetite in\nhumans [16,17]. Test meal studies demonstrated post-\nprandial ghrelin suppression is associated with a reduc-\ntion in hunger in normal-weight subjects [5,18]. Recent\nstudies on ghrelin shed light on the possible role of this\nhormone in acute illness. Alterations in ghrelin concentra-\ntion may have a role to play in appetite and energy intake\nin acute illness, thus contributing to hospital malnutrition\n[2]. Previous studies have confirmed the role of ghrelin in\nmeal initiation [3,16]. Results from studies infusing ghre-\nlin in cancer patients [19] and administering subcutane-\nous ghrelin in dialysis patients with mild to moderate\nmalnutrition [20] suggest ghrelin may be helpful to\nincrease appetite in cachectic or malnourished patients.\nIn the current study, an acute phase response to surgery\nwas observed during the whole stay. Acute phase response\nproteins and cytokines release may have affected the gut\nhormone concentrations. It is not fully understood how\nchanges in acute phase response proteins affect ghrelin\nconcentrations. Further research is required before any\ndietary interventions, aiming to manipulate ghrelin\nrelease can be recommended. It appears that ghrelin plays\ndifferent roles in several pathologies. Although ghrelin is\nwell-known as a hormone that is associated with negative\nenergy balance, further work in different patient groups\nmight further reveal the role of ghrelin on appetite and\nfood intake.\nParticular areas requiring elucidation include the relation-\nship between inflammatory cytokines and gut hormone\nactivity and also the impact of medication, especially anti-\nbiotics which affect gut flora, and vasoactive drugs which\nhave an effect on blood flow and motility.\nFasting (light grey bars) and postprandial (dark grey bars) plasma ghrelin concentr tions (me  \u00b1 SEM) 45 minute  fol-lowi  the sta t of  test meal in 17 coronary art ry bypass gr fting patie ts (CABG) and matche  c t ols, + p < 0.05 fasting pos op versus fasting preop & controls, fasti g follow-up versus fasting pr op & controlsigure 1\nFasting (light grey bars) and postprandial (dark grey bars) \nplasma ghrelin concentrations (mean \u00b1 SEM) 45 minutes fol-\nlowing the start of a test meal in 17 coronary artery bypass \ngrafting patients (CABG) and matched controls, + p < 0.05 \nfasting postop versus fasting preop & controls, fasting follow-\nup versus fasting preop & controls ; * p < 0.05 \u2206 change \npostop & follow-up versus preop & controls (ANOVA).Page 3 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nNutrition & Metabolism 2007, 4:20 http:\/\/www.nutritionandmetabolism.com\/content\/4\/1\/20Postprandial ghrelin suppression is a natural response to\neating [5], that appears exaggerated after major surgery. In\nthis study patients consumed only half of their energy\nrequirements in the immediate post operative period and\nhad a significant lower daily energy intake at follow-up.\nOver the 40-day study period they lost 4% body weight\nand had a 5% reduction in MAC.\nGhrelin, an acylated peptide, stimulates feeding and GH\nsecretion via interactions with the GH secretagogue type\n1a receptor (GHS-R1a), the functionally active form of the\nGHS-R. Ghrelin enhances feeding via the neuronal path-\nways of neuropeptide Y\/AgRP and orexin, which act as\norexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus [21]. Central\ndes-acyl ghrelin may activate orexin-expressing neurons,\nperhaps functioning in feeding regulation through inter-\nactions with a target protein distinct from the GHS-R. It is\nnot fully understood how sickness following major surgi-\ncal procedures affect ghrelin receptors and their functions.\nAlthough the mechanism of ghrelin's orexigenic activity is\nrelated to the neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related\nprotein (AgRP) pathways [21], the interaction of ghrelin\nwith other energy-regulating systems is unclear.\nIn spite of the methodological limitation and being\nrestricted to just one postprandial blood sample (45\nmins), we observed an exaggerated ghrelin suppression\npost-operatively and at follow-up; we might have\nexpected less ghrelin suppression in the CABG patients\ndue to their BMI (29 kg\/m2) category [5].\nSeveral previous studies have suggested that plasma ghre-\nlin concentration is associated with the short term regula-\ntion of appetite and nutritional status [3,5,12].  Recent\nwork by our group showed suppressed baseline concen-\ntrations of ghrelin during a 28 day period after admission\nto intensive care [2]. It is possible that ghrelin, may partly\nbe involved in long term regulation of food intake in par-\nallel with their short-term effects in conjunction with sev-\neral other neural, humeral, and psychological factors that\nmanage this complex process, so called \"appetite\". This\nidea is lent support by Cummings et al., who have high-\nlighted evidence indicating that ghrelin can be considered\nas a participant in long-term body-weight regulation [22].\nAlthough this is a first study to assess dynamic responses\nof ghrelin on a small number of CABG patients, it raises\nthe intriguing possibility that appetite regulatory peptide\nconcentrations may be influenced by surgical procedures,\nthus contributing to continuing reduced daily energy\nintake during the recovery period. Further studies are\nrequired to establish definitively the role of ghrelin and\nother gut hormones in post-operative surgical patients.\nAbbreviations\nCABG, coronary artery bypass grafting\nMAC, mid arm circumference\nVAS, visual analogue scale\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nGF, AB, SJB, PIH and MN were responsible for designing\nthe study.
