Measurement\nof the burden of injuries is needed at a global, national and regional level to be able to inform injured people of\nthe likely duration of impairment; to guide policy makers in investing in preventative measures; to facilitate the\nevaluation and cost effectiveness of interventions and to contribute to international efforts to more accurately\nassess the global burden of injuries.\nMethods\/Design: A prospective, longitudinal multi-centre study of 1333 injured individuals, atttending\nEmergency Departments or admitted to hospital in four UK areas: Swansea, Surrey, Bristol and Nottingham.\nSpecified quotas of patients with defined injuries covering the whole spectrum will be recruited. Participants (or\na proxy) will complete a baseline questionnaire regarding their injury and pre-injury quality of life. Follow up\noccurs at 1, 4, and 12 months post injury or until return to normal function within 12 months, with measures of\nhealth service utilisation, impairment, disability, and health related quality of life. National estimates of the burden\nof injuries will be calculated by extrapolation from the sample population to national and regional computerised\nhospital in-patient, emergency department and mortality data.\nDiscussion: This study will provide more detailed data on the national burden of injuries than has previously\nbeen available in any country and will contribute to international collaborative efforts to more accurately assess\nthe global burden of injuries. The results will be used to advise policy makers on prioritisation of preventive\nmeasures, support the evaluation of interventions, and provide guidance on the likely impact and degree of\nimpairment and disability following specific injuries.\nPublished: 8 November 2007\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:317 doi:10.1186\/1471-2458-7-317\nReceived: 27 July 2007\nAccepted: 8 November 2007\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/317\n\u00a9 2007 Lyons et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:317 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/317Background\nThe burden of injury can be assessed from a number of\nperspectives; that of the individual, their family, commu-\nnities, the health service, the economy and society as a\nwhole. The Global Burden of Disease and Injuries Study\n(GBDI) by the World Health Organization has helped to\nestablish international methods of measuring the burden\nof disease and injury on a global basis [1], while the\nnotion of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs [2]) was\ndeveloped to broaden the measurements of the impact of\ndisease and injury. However, the calculation of DALYs has\nbeen subject to a number of different approaches, and\nthere is little evidence relating to their validity, reliability\nand sensitivity as a measurement instrument [3]. The\nGBDI study, whilst representing a marked improvement\nin our knowledge of the global impact of injuries, has\nmajor shortcomings, including a reliance on professionals\nestimates on the severity and duration of post injury disa-\nbility rather than the collection of empirical data and an\nabsence of data on several injury categories, particularly\nthose which are less life threatening [1]. Whilst the GBDI\napproach has been adopted to measure the national bur-\nden of injuries in several countries and there are a number\nof burden of injury studies which have been carried out\nfor specific types of injuries, [4,5] empirical prospectively\ncollected data on comprehensive injury populations is\nextremely rare.\nThe most comprehensive study to date is a Dutch study\nwhich includes substantial numbers of patients but was\nsomewhat limited by a low response rate and absence of\npre-injury measurement of disability, due to recruitment\nby letter some 2 months post injury [6]. There has been\nmuch investigation into how routine measures collected\nin hospitals can provide indicators of severity. However,\nindicators such as hospital admission and length of stay\nmay not be reliable measures of long-term consequences\n[7-10]. For example, Barker et al [7] demonstrated that\nbetween half and three quarters of injuries in children and\nyoung adults that resulted in permanent disability were\ntreated as outpatients and that most of these resulted from\nhand injures. Even within the category of hand injuries,\nseemingly similar categories of anatomical injuries can\nhave widely different consequences. Loss of a little finger\nhad very limited functional consequences, whereas loss of\nthumb is so devastating that transplantation of a big toe is\ncommon practice to reduce the functional severity of the\ninjury [11].\nLangley and Cryer have demonstrated that trends in hos-\npitalisation rates for all injuries and hospital lengths of\nstay are not reliable indicators of the incidence of serious\ninjuries [8,9]. A recently published review of post injury\ndisability studies provided recommended guidelines on\nthe selection of patients and measurement instruments\nand the timing of their application in future burden of\ninjury studies. These guidelines proposed an integrated\napproach whereby [10] complementary measures of\nhealth related quality of life (HUI3 and EQ-5D), time off\nwork and restricted activities are collected simultaneously\nin order to study the inter-relationship between variables\nand more comprehensively describe the burden of injury\nin patients attending emergency departments or admitted\nto hospital. In addition, a 'pre-injury' quality of life meas-\nure is also recommended which can only realistically be\nassessed shortly after injury. This recommendation is sup-\nported by recently published research which shows that\npre-injury quality of life scores in injured individuals dif-\nfer significantly from age and sex matched general popu-\nlation scores [12].\nOne of the authors of this study (RAL) was involved in the\ndevelopment of the guidelines which influenced the\ndesign of this study. In addition, measures of severity of\nthreat to life (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS [13]) and\nInternational Classification of Disease-Based Severity\nScore (ICISS) [14]) have been included in this study to\nfacilitate comparison with international studies using\nhospital separation data [14]. The combination of post\ninjury disability data with injury mortality data is required\nto measure the total burden of injuries and provide com-\nparison with studies using QALYS and DALYS [3,15]. This\nstudy also includes a qualitative component to comple-\nment the largely quantitative approach used in this and\nexisting studies. This mixed methods approach is used as\nit is recognised that no instrument or collection of instru-\nments comprehensively captures all aspects of the burden\nof injury on individuals and their families.\nAims\nThe aim of the study is to provide estimates of the UK bur-\nden of injury in order to help policy makers and practi-\ntioners prioritise intervention measures and to contribute\nto international efforts to more accurately assess the glo-\nbal burden of injuries.\nObjectives\nTo measure the impact of varying severities of injuries for\nchildren and young people, adults and older people in\nrelation to:\n1. The effects on health related quality of life and disabil-\nity.\n2. The consequences for health and social care services in\nterms of resource utilisation.\n3. The effects on the economy and the labour market in\nterms of working days and working life years lost.Page 2 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:317 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/3174. The personal impact of injury to the individual and\ntheir experiences following the injury.\n5. The total UK burden of injuries by combining study\nspecific disability data with administrative health and\nmortality datasets.\nMethods\/Design\nParticipants\nThis is a mixed quantitative and qualitative prospective\nlongitudinal multi-site study involving patients with a\ncomprehensive spectrum of injuries. Four centres in the\nUK (Swansea, Nottingham, Bristol, Surrey) will recruit\nemergency department attendees and those admitted to\nhospital following an injury. Tables 1, 2 and 3 describe\nthe stratified sample of patients to be recruited into the\nstudy. This stratification was designed to include the most\ncommon injuries (e.g. fractures, sprains), the potentially\nmost disabling injuries (e.g. hand or eye injuries) and less\ncommon but important injuries (e.g. head injury, burns).\nPotential participants will be identified by emergency\ndepartment staff. Those who agree to discuss the study\nwith a member of the research team will have the study\nexplained to them, be given the study information sheet\nand a consent form to complete. For younger children or\nadults who can not give consent themselves, a proxy (rel-\native or carer) will be asked to read the information sheet\nand give assent to the study.\nExclusion\/Inclusion Criteria\nInclusion criteria: patients aged 5 years and over, with\ninjury types as specified in tables 1, 2, 3, which occurred\nup to 2 weeks prior to the date of recruitment or within 4\nweeks if the patient is admitted to hospital with a serious\ninjury, who are able to give consent and complete ques-\ntionnaires OR who have a suitable proxy who can assent\nto their participation and complete questionnaires in the\nfuture.\nExclusion criteria: patients with injury types not specified\nin tables 1 and 3, children below the age of 5, those who\nare unable to give consent themselves and do not have a\nsuitable proxy that can assent to their participation and\nthose who are unable to complete questionnaires in the\nfuture. Children less than 5 years have been excluded due\nto a lack of suitable measurement instruments. Patients\nwith no address or those who are leaving the UK perma-\nnently and patients with stings and foreign bodies in the\near have been excluded.\nMeasures\nAt baseline (day of recruitment into the study) partici-\npants will be asked to complete a questionnaire contain-\ning questions on the circumstances surrounding the\ninjury, injury intent, socio-demographic details, use of\nhealth and social services in the 4 weeks prior to the injury\nand the EQ-5D (a measure of quality of life [16]) or the\nPedsQL (Quality of life for children (aged less than 16\nTable 3: Number of participants to be recruited per centre by \nage group and anatomical site of injury [Admitted patients or In-\npatients].\nAge group\n5\u201324 25\u201359 60+\nNumber 220 220 220\nThermal (any site) 20 20 20\nHead\/face 40 40 20\nThorax 20 20 20\nAbdomen\/Pelvis 16 16 20\nHip * * 40\nLeg 40 40 24\nArm 40 40 24\nWrist 16 16 20\nHand 16 16 16\nOthers including neck \ninjuries\n16 16 16\n* Hip can be included in leg injuries in people aged < 60.\nTable 1: Number of participants to be recruited per centre, by \nage group and injury type [Non admitted patients]\nInjury type Total \nnumber\nNumber in each age group\n5\u201324 25\u201359 60+\nFracture\/Dislocation* 200 64 68 68\nLaceration 80 24 28 28\nBruises\/Abrasions 80 24 28 28\nSprains 160 60 60 40\nBurns\/Scalds 60 20 20 20\nHead injury 60 20 20 20\nEye injury 20 Any age\n*See table 2\nTable 2: Break down of fractures\/dislocations and sprains;\nAge group\n5\u201324 25\u201359 60+\nFractures\/Dislocations\nWrist 12 12 12\nUpper arm\/elbow 12 12 12\nAnkle 12 12 12\nDigits 12 12 12\nOthers 16 16 16\nSprains\nWrist 12 12 8\nAnkle 12 12 8\nKnee 12 12 8\nNeck strain 12 12 12\nOther 12 12 4Page 3 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:317 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/317years) [17] relating to the day before the injury. At 1\nmonth, 4 months and 12 months post recruitment, partic-\nipants will be asked to complete a questionnaire contain-\ning questions on whether they are still affected by their\ninjury, use of health and social services and time off work\nin preceding 4 weeks, the EQ-5D\/PedsQL relating to the\nday of questionnaire completion, the Work Limitations\nQuestionnaire (self completed for adults) relating to the\npreceding 2 weeks and version 3 of the Health Utilities\nIndex (HUI [18]) relating to the preceding 4 weeks. The\nchoice of instruments was determined by a review of the\nliterature and published guidelines. [19] All measures will\nbe completed by the injured person or by proxy if neces-\nsary (except for the Work Limitations Questionnaire\nwhich can not be completed by proxy). Follow up ques-\ntionnaires will be administered by post or participants\nwill be able to complete a web-based questionnaire on a\nsecure server with ID and password protection. Non-\nresponders will be followed up by repeat mailed question-\nnaires and\/or telephone reminders. Participants reporting\nthat their injury no longer affects them will not be sent\nfuture follow-up questionnaires. A small incentive (\u00a32\nstore voucher) will be sent with each follow up question-\nnaire. Also, all participants will be entered into a draw at\nthe end of the study with 10 prizes of \u00a3100 of high street\nvouchers.\nData will be extracted from the medical records on date\nand time of injury, whether injury resulted from a road\ntraffic accident, full text of diagnosis and treatment\n(including X-ray reports and surgical procedures), hospi-\ntal admission and recommended follow-up. In the case of\nburns we will also record location, degree and percentage\nof body affected, in the case of head injury we will also\nrecord the lowest Glasgow Coma Score [20] and length of\ntime of loss of consciousness. Socio-economic status will\nbe based on area deprivation scores derived from the post-\ncode of residence.\nWhere possible, the following information will be col-\nlected for patients who do not consent to the study: sex,\nage, place of injury and type of injury.\nQualitative interviews\nSemi-structured interviews will explore issues such as fac-\ntors that facilitate or hinder recovery including access to\nhealth care and social support and issues surrounding the\neffects of insurance and compensation. Interviews will be\nconducted in the participant's own homes or by tele-\nphone and will be audio taped and transcribed. A total of\n90 interviews will be conducted across 3 centres (Swansea,\nBristol and Surrey). In each centre, 10 participants will be\ninterviewed from each of three age groups; 5\u201324, 25\u201359\nand 60 years and over. The sampling frame for the inter-\nviews will be stratified by centre, age and injury severity.\nCentres for recruitment\nRecruitment will be undertaken in four geographic cen-\ntres: Royal Surrey County Hospital in Surrey, Morriston\nHospital in Swansea, Bristol Royal Infirmary in Bristol\nand the Nottingham University NHS Trust in Notting-\nham.\nEthical considerations\nThe study has multi-centre research ethics committee\napproval from the Dyfed Powys Local Ethics Committee\n(Number: 05\/WMW01\/23).\nAnalysis\nThe analysis will provide estimates of the burden of injury\nusing multiple approaches. Effects on disability and qual-\nity of life will assessed using the EQ-5D, the HUI, the\nWork Limitations Questionnaire, time off work and utili-\nzation of health and social care resources, by age (5\u201324,\n25\u201359, 60+), gender, socio-economic status, injury setting\n(home, road, occupational, leisure), type of injury (burn,\nfracture, etc), anatomical site of injury and finally hospital\nadmission status. Estimates will be made of the QALYs\nlost by combining the above variables with mortality data\nfor the entire group and above subgroups. The distribu-\ntion of recovery times will be calculated taking into con-\nsideration variables above (i.e injury type, age group etc).\nWhere results are similar across injury types, sites or age\ngroups the data will be combined to improve the preci-\nsion of estimates. If we are able to successfully apply the\nICISS to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)\n10th Edition codes from hospital admission data (Hospi-\ntal Episode Statistics (HES) in England and Patient Epi-\nsode Database for Wales (PEDW)), we will extrapolate\nfrom these data to produce national estimates of the bur-\nden of injury resulting from injuries requiring hospital\nadmission based on the measures described above. We\nwill also produce national estimates of the burden of\ninjury associated with injuries requiring emergency\ndepartment attendance based on the numbers and types\nof injuries attending hospital emergency departments, uti-\nlising regional surveillance systems where national data\nare not available, such as the All Wales Injury Surveillance\nSystem [AWISS] [21]. Derived estimates of post injury dis-\nability will be combined with published mortality data\nfrom the Office of National Statistics (ONS) to calculate\nthe overall burden of injuries. We will carry out sensitivity\nanalysis to explore possible effects of non-response bias.\nQualitative interviews will be transcribed, analysed using\nthematic content analysis and inter-coder reliability will\nbe assessed. Participants' experiences of life post injury\nwill be described. Responses relating to utilisation of\nhealth and social services will be translated into resource\nimplications using relevant published unit cost data,\nwhile the economic impact of work loss will be estimated\nusing wage rates and measures of national output.Page 4 of 6\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:317 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/317Sample size\nThe sample size will be 1333, comprising 334 participants\nrecruited from each centre over a 20 month period. This\nnumber was derived from the sampling frame in tables 1\nand 3, aiming to recruit a minimum of approximately\n15\u201320 participants in each cell in order that reasonably\nreliable estimates of the each of the measures can be\nobtained for each cell. The overall sample size and num-\nbers within each injury category and group reflect prag-\nmatic decisions based on available finances and a desire\nto cover as comprehensive a population of injury catego-\nries as possible.\nIn order to estimate the UK burden of injury it is necessary\nto extrapolate the findings from this study to all those\nattending similar emergency departments or admitted to\nhospital. Theoretically a large random sample of patients\nattending the emergency departments in each of the cen-\ntres would be the ideal method to assess the overall bur-\nden of injury. However, because minor injuries are more\ncommon than moderate or severe injuries, this would\nresult in large numbers of people with minor injuries\nbeing recruited and very few with moderate or severe inju-\nries; which would result in very imprecise estimates of the\nburden of injury for moderate and severe injuries. There-\nfore, we undertook quota sampling to ensure a mix of dif-\nferent types of injury at different levels of severity. This\nmethod is likely to fail to recruit some uncommon inju-\nries with a total sample of 1333. However, uncommon\ninjuries are unlikely to make a large contribution to the\nestimates of the burden of injury at a national level. If data\nare deficient for certain important injuries we will explore\nthe possibility of imputing data for national extrapola-\ntions from the most comparable study in the Netherlands\nusing relative differences in quality of life in included and\nmissing injury subtypes [6].\nTime scale\nParticipants will be recruited from September 2005 to\nApril 2007 with follow-up completed in April 2008.\nDiscussion\nThe study with a relatively large sample size, measurement\nof pre and post injury status and a potentially higher\nresponse rate than previous studies should constitute the\nmost detailed and comprehensive study of injuries of var-\nying severity to date. conducted to date in a population\nwith a wide spread of injury severities. The methodologi-\ncal developments and data from this study should also\nmake a substantial contribution to the international col-\nlaborative effort to more accurately assess the global bur-\nden of injuries.\nIn addition, this study will provide much improved esti-\nmates of the UK burden of injuries in terms of disability,\ncost and premature mortality. It is intended that this\ninformation will stimulate policy makers and practition-\ners to increase investment in effective injury prevention\ninterventions and to support research into new interven-\ntions where the burden of injuries is high but evidence for\neffective interventions is lacking.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nRL, ET, DK, NC, SB, CP and CC wrote the original grant\nproposal.
