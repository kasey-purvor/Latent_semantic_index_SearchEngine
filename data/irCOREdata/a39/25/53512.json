INTRODUCTION \n \nMany researchers had studied the chaotic behavior of an autonomous system [1]. \n 2 \nSome trajectory equations and sets of initial conditions corresponding to some types \nof trajectories are characterized in [1]. However, practically, various types of input \nsignals are usually applied. As a result, we need to analyze forced-input systems in \naddition to autonomous systems. For the step-input case, some new analytical and \nsimulation results analogous to the autonomous case can be obtained by the method of \naffine transformation [2]. In this paper, we concentrate on the analysis of systems with \nsinusoidal inputs. In this case, the method of affine transformation is not sufficient to \nefficiently explain the trajectory behaviors, and other techniques, such as the \nfrequency-domain technique, have to be employed as well. \n \nII.  SYSTEM DESCRIPTION \n \nFollowing [1], [2], the state space model of a direct form second-order digital \nfilter with two\u2019s complement arithmetic can be modeled as \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kskuk\nkukxakxbf\nkx\nk \uf0d7\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\uf03d\uf0fa\n\uf0fb\n\uf0f9\n\uf0ea\n\uf0eb\n\uf0e9\n\uf02b\uf0d7\uf02b\uf0d7\n\uf03d\uf02b\n2\n0\n1\n21\n2 BxAx . (1) \nIn this paper, we only consider the case when the filter is marginally stable, that \nis 1\uf02d\uf03db  and 2\uf03ca . The external input is represented as \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029kvkcku \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03d \uf071sin  \nfor \uf07b \uf07d0\\\uf0c2\uf0cec , \uf07b \uf07dZ\uf0ce\uf0d7\uf0c2\uf0ce kk :\\ \uf070\uf071 , and \uf028 \uf029kv  is the unit step function. When \n0\uf03dc  or \uf070\uf071 \uf0d7\uf03d k , where Z\uf0cek , the input signal is zero everywhere and the system \nreduces to the autonomous response case, for which detail analysis can be found in \n[1]. \nThe behaviors of the state trajectories of the autonomous response are reported in \n[1]. Based on the method of affine transformation, new results can also be derived for \nthe step response case [2]. However, is the behavior for the sinusoidal response \n 3 \nsimilar to those of the autonomous and step response cases? What are the trajectory \npatterns on the phase portrait? What are the sets of initial conditions for the different \ntypes of trajectories? How do the filter and input parameters affect the trajectory \nbehavior? \n \nIII.

Since \n2\uf03ca , \uf057  is not integer multiples of \uf070 , so 1\uf02d\uf057T  exists. As \uf070\uf071 \uf0d7\uf0b9 k , so \n1\uf02d\n\uf071T  \nalso exists. Hence, we have \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 \uf02a\uf02d\uf02a\uf02d\uf057\uf057\uf057 \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf02d\uf02b\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03d 1111 0 xTATxxTATx \uf071\uf071\uf071 kkk\n\uf029\uf029\n for 1\uf0b3k . (2) \nSince \uf028 \uf029kx  is a superposition of two signals with different frequencies, this \ncauses a rich set of trajectory patterns on the phase portrait. Figure 1 shows some \nexamples of the different types of trajectories. As shown in Figure 1, the trajectory \npatterns are different from, and more complicated than those of the autonomous and \nstep response cases. \nIt can be also seen from Figure 1.1 that there are several ellipses on the phase \nportrait even when no overflow occurs. This trajectory pattern seems to correspond to \nthe type II trajectory (overflow case) for the autonomous and step response cases [1], \n[2]. However, overflow does not occur for the sinusoidal response case. Hence, we \ncannot classify the types of trajectories based on the visual appearances of the \n 4 \ntrajectories. As a result, we have to employ other properties, such as the periodicity of \nsymbolic sequences, for the classification of the types of trajectories. \n \nB. Periodicity of state vector \nBecause \uf028 \uf029kx  is made up of two different components with frequencies \uf057  \nand \uf071 , the frequency spectrum of \uf028 \uf029kx  consists of a finite set of impulses. If \uf057  \nand \uf071  are rational multiples of \uf070 , that is, \uf070\uf0d7\uf03d\uf057 1p  and \uf070\uf071 \uf0d7\uf03d 2p , for \nQ\uf0ce21, pp , then \uf028 \uf029kx  is periodic. So, there are finitely many distinct points on the \ntrajectory as shown in Figure 2.1. However, if \uf057  or \uf071  are not rational multiples of \n\uf070 , then \uf028 \uf029kx  is aperiodic. Hence, there are infinitely many distinct points on the \ntrajectory as shown in Figure 2.2. \nCompared to the autonomous and step response cases, \uf028 \uf029kx  is made up of a \ncomponent with frequency \uf057  and a DC component. If \uf057  is a rational multiple of \n\uf070 , that is, \uf070\uf0d7\uf03d\uf057 1p , for Q\uf0ce1p , then \uf028 \uf029kx  is periodic. So, there are finitely many \ndistinct points on the ellipse. However, if \uf057  is not a rational multiple of \uf070 , then \nthere are infinitely many distinct points on the ellipse [1]-[3]. \n \nC. Set of initial conditions \nIt was found that the set of initial conditions for the autonomous and step \nresponse cases when no overflow occurs can be described by an elliptical region [1], \n[2]. We found a similar result for the sinusoidal response. As no overflow occurs, we \nhave \n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029 \uf02a\uf02d\uf02a\uf02d\uf057 \uf0d7\uf02d\uf0a3\uf02b\uf0d7 1111 10 xTxxT \uf071 . (3) \nHence, the set of initial conditions for the non-overflow case is \n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\uf07b \uf07d\uf02a\uf02d\uf02a\uf02d\uf057 \uf0d7\uf02d\uf0a3\uf02b\uf0d7 1111 10:0 xTxxTx \uf071 . (4) \n 5 \nThis set of initial conditions can be represented as an elliptical region in the \nphase portrait diagram. The center of the ellipse is located at \uf02a\uf02d 1x  and the size of the \nellipse depends on \uf02a\uf02d \uf0d7\uf02d 1\n11 xT\uf071 . Figure 3 shows an example of the set of initial \nconditions for the situation when overflow does not occur. \n \nD. Necessary conditions on the filter parameters \nFor the autonomous response case, there always exist some initial conditions for \nany filter parameter in the set \uf07b \uf07d2: \uf03c\uf0ce aaa  such that the system is free from \noverflow [2]. However, this is not true for the sinusoidal response case because there \nare two more parameters from the input signal, c  and \uf071 . In fact, we have found that \nif the set of filter and input parameters fails to satisfy a particular relation, then \noverflow has to occur no matter what the initial conditions are. \nFrom the inequality (3), we have \n\uf028 \uf029\uf028 \uf029\n\uf028 \uf029\uf071\uf071 coscos2110 1\n1\n1\n1\n\uf02d\uf057\uf0d7\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf0d7\uf02d\uf0a3\uf02b\uf0d7 \uf02a\uf02d\uf02a\uf02d\uf057\ncxTxxT . (5) \nHence, we have \n\uf071coscos\n2\n\uf02d\uf057\uf0a3\nc\n. (6) \nIf the relation (6) is not satisfied, overflow has to occur no matter what the initial \nconditions are. Figure 4 shows the region of the parameter space that satisfies the \nrelation (6). \nFrom the analysis, if \uf057\uf0b1\uf0d7\uf0d7\uf03d m\uf070\uf071 2 , then c  has to be zero. Therefore, \noverflow will occur no matter what the initial conditions are, even when a very small \nsignal ( 0\uf0aec , where 0\uf03ec ) is applied to the system. This phenomenon can be \nunderstood by the resonance behavior. \n \n 6 \n \nIV. ANALYTICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS FOR OVERFLOW CASE \n \nA. Trajectory equation \nFor the autonomous and step response cases, there are more than one ellipses on \nthe phase portrait [1], [2] if the symbolic sequence is periodic.

This is different from the non-overflow case, where there are only \nthe frequency components \uf057  and \uf071 . Because more sinusoidal signals are \nsuperimposed together, the visual appearance for the periodic symbolic sequence case \nmay be different from that of the non-overflow case. For example, if overflow does \nnot occur at a certain initial condition \uf028 \uf0290x , and gives periodic symbolic sequences \nfor another initial condition \uf028 \uf0290x\uf0a2 , while \uf057  and \uf071  are unchanged, the visual \nappearance of periodic symbolic sequence case may be different from that of the \nnon-overflow case. This change of the visual appearance of the trajectory pattern does \nnot occur in the autonomous and step response cases because only elliptical pattern \noccurs in both the type I and type II trajectory for the autonomous and step response \ncases.

Necessary conditions on filter parameters \nThe necessary conditions for the periodic symbolic sequence case can be \ninvestigated by examining the conditions when the relation (9) or (10) is satisfied. To \nunderstand the expression (9) or (10) more, we can look at the expression term by \nterm. For the first term, if those centers discussed in section IVB are inside the unit \nsquare 2I  [1], then one can select the initial condition \uf028 \uf0290x  as close to those centers \nas possible so that the above norms are close to zero. The second term is directly \n 9 \nproportional to the amplitude of the input sinusoidal signal. As the amplitude of the \ninput sinusoidal signal is small, then this norm is also small.

Simulation results for aperiodic symbolic sequence case \nWhen the symbolic sequences are eventually periodic or aperiodic, the dynamic \nof the system is so complex that only some simulation results are obtained. For the \nautonomous and step response cases, it is reported in [1], [2] that there is an elliptical \nfractal pattern on the phase portrait if the symbolic sequences are aperiodic. However, \nwe have conducted extensive simulations and find that both an elliptical fractal \npattern and a rather random-like chaotic behavior may be exhibited for the sinusoidal \nresponse case. Figure 6 illustrates the simulation results. \n \nV. CONCLUSION \n \nThe main focus of this paper is the analysis of second-order digital filters with \ntwo\u2019s complement arithmetic, when there are sinusoidal inputs. For the autonomous \nand step response cases, the trajectories can be classified by their visual appearances \n[1]. However, such classification is not applicable for the sinusoidal response case. \nInstead, we analyze the system behaviors by means of the periodicity of the symbolic \n 10 \nsequences. Hence, instead of study the behaviors, the effect of the initial conditions \nand the filter parameters on different types of trajectories, we study those behaviors \non different types of symbolic sequences. \nEven when overflow does not occur, many trajectory patterns may be exhibited \non the phase portrait. One interesting example is that there are several ellipses on the \nphase portrait, which appears to correspond to the type II trajectory for the \nautonomous and step response cases [1], [2]. The condition for the state vector to be \nperiodic is investigated. The set of initial conditions and the set of filter and input \nparameters are also found. \nWhen overflow occurs, the system dynamics is very complex. If the \ncorresponding symbolic sequences are periodic, some analytical results are obtained \nby employing the frequency domain approach. Based on this approach, the set of \ninitial conditions and the necessary conditions on the filter parameters are derived. \nWhen the symbolic sequences are aperiodic, both an elliptical fractal pattern and \na rather random-like chaotic behavior may be exhibited on the phase portrait instead \nof only the elliptical fractal type of pattern for the type III trajectories found in the \nautonomous and step response cases [1], [2]. Some simulation results are given. \n \nREFERENCES \n \n[1] L. O. Chua and T.
