However, such tiled surfaces can allow contaminants to enter into, \nand exit a space via a tiled surface, through the porous tile grouts used to fill the void between \nadjoining tiles; resulting in water, germs and other harmful agents often permeating into cavities \nbehind the tiles, corroding the bonding agent used to fix the tile to the substrate, the substrate itself or \neven the ceramic tile. Moreover, the predominant problem with commercially available tile grouts is \nthat because they are very difficult to clean, over time they become contaminated, and have to be \nremoved physically or mechanically; an arduous and costly undertaking.  \nAs has been demonstrated in Part I of the paper, using a new form of tile grout, it is feasible to \nproduce a laser induced impervious surface glaze on a vitreous enamel coating applied to the surface \nof an amalgamated compound oxide grout (AOCG) placed in the void between adjoining vitrified \nceramic tiles, thus sealing and joining together the tiles permanently. The AOCG proved to be a most \nsuitable base material, bonding well to the ceramic tiles even at elevated temperatures, and allowing \nthe laser glazed enamel coating to wet, and therefore bond well, to the surface (see Part I of this \npaper). \nIn this paper we report on the mechanical and chemical testing of the laser generated seals in \ncomparison with existing epoxy tile grouts, in order to determine the physical properties of both \nmaterials. Mechanical tests on the seals were conducted to determine such properties as smoothness, \nrupture and impact strength, bond strength and permeability to water. Also, chemical tests were \ncarried out to examine the corrosion resistance of the bonds with regard to mineral acid (nitric and \nsodium hydroxide) and detergent. In order to analyse the laser treated specimens, they were sectioned \nwith a Struers cutting machine using a diamond rimed cutting blade, and then polished using cloths \nand diamond suspension pastes. The sectioned samples were then examined using optical \nmicroscopy, SEM, EDAX, and XRD techniques. \nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND RESULTS \nCurrent British and international standards, in relation to tile grout, are concerned only with water \nabsorption and compressive strength, whilst for actual ceramic tiles, standard tests exist for the \ndetermination of water absorption and chemical resistance. Consequently, it was not possible to test \n 4 \nthe laser generated seals according to, and strictly adhering to, established tests. As such, wherever \npossible tests based on current standards were developed to investigate specific aspects of particular \nrelevance to the laser generated seals; namely the pull-off strength, the surface roughness, the rupture \nstrength, the wear resistance, the permeability characteristics (water) and the corrosion resistance.  \nPull-Off Testing \nIn order to test the bond strength of the laser treated AOCG and the enamel seal to the laser treated \nAOCG and ceramic tile surface, as well as the strength of the enamel coated AOCG, pull-off tests \nwere conducted. For the tests the AOCG, enamel\/AOCG and the enamel\/ceramic tile were prepared \nas large area samples (10mm x 10mm). For the tests on the complete seal the ceramic tiles were cut \ninto smaller pieces (20 x 20mm) and applied in pairs using an Araldite epoxy to an ordinary Portland \ncement (OPC) substrate and allowed to cure for 24 hours. The spacing between the vitrified edges of \neach tile pair was the industry recommended 1.5mm. The samples were then laser sealed as described \nin Part I of this paper. High tensile aluminium test dollies were then attached onto the surfaces and to \nthe axially opposite substrate surfaces using Araldite epoxy and left to cure for 24 hours. In order to \nensure axial accuracy (essential for true results), the test dollies were set in position using identical \nV-blocks. As shown in Figure 1, the samples were placed into an Instron 4507 tensile\/compressive \ntest rig by mounting the test dollies into the jaws of the rig. A tensile force was then applied until \nfailure, with the energy being recorded. \nThe results obtained for the AOCG varied markedly with changes in the laser operating parameters, \nas Figure 2 shows. A post-test analysis of the samples showed that the material failed approximately \n150\u00b5m below the laser treated surface in the HAZ. An optical analysis of the detached surfaces \nshowed that the enamel had detached cleanly and completely from both the AOCG and the ceramic \ntile at the interface. \nFor the enamel\/AOCG and the enamel\/ceramic tile the average bond strength was recorded as          \n60 MPa and 45 MPa respectively. The results obtained from the tests showed little variation within \nthe optimum laser operating parameters (shown in Part I), indicating that neither the power density \nnor the traverse speed influenced the bond strength of the enamel.  \n \nSurface Roughness Testing \n 5 \nAn important feature of the enamel seal is its surface roughness; since it is this that determines the \ncleanability of the tile surface as a whole. Using the Taylor-Hobson Surtonic 3+ surface texture \nmeasuring instrument, a series of measurements were taken on the surface of a layer of an epoxy \ngrout (polished to ensure a measurement could be taken), the vitrified surface of a ceramic tile and \nthe surface of a laser generated enamel seal. On each sample four measurements were taken in \ndifferent positions and in different directions on the surface, with an average being taken. Table 1 \nsummarises the surface roughness (Ra)  measurement results.  \nAs Table 1 shows, the surface roughness of the enamel seal is many times less than that of a \nconventional epoxy grout, even when polished. In ordinary operating conditions where the surface \nroughness of the epoxy grout is not polished, but is determined by the means of application, the \nsurface roughness was measured in excess of 30\u00b5m. Clearly, in this situation the surface roughness, \nand therefore the cleanability, of the enamel seal will be considerably better.  \nRupture Strength Testing \nTests were conducted to determine the rupture strength of the enamel glaze when comprising a \ncomplete seal and the vitreous glaze on the surface a ceramic tile. Test samples were prepared as \ndescribed in Section 2.1. The samples were placed onto the sample stage of the Instron 4507 \ntensile\/compressive test rig and then subjected to a compressive rupture force until the enamel seal \nfailed (cracked), as shown in Figure 3, with the energy being recorded. The rupture force was applied \nby means of a high tensile steel indentor with a 1mm radius point. \nThe results of the test are summarised in Table 2. As one can see there was little variation between \nthe average rupture strength of the enamel seal and the vitreous tile glaze, 2.6 J and 3.0 J; with the \nenamel seal ranging from 2.3-2.7 J, whilst the vitreous tile glaze ranged from only 2.9-3.0 J. \nHowever, because of the shape of the tile edges, the enamel seal, when laser fired, naturally assumes \na concave surface geometry. Thus, the strains within the enamel layer are higher, therefore reducing \nthe strength (if the enamel was of a flat surface profile) by some 40-50% [1]. \nIt is well established that substrate thickness has a significant effect upon the rupture strength of an \nenamel coating [1]. Therefore, because the thickness of the AOCG was not controlled as accurately \nas the thickness of the bulk ceramic tile material, slight variations in the recorded rupture strength are \nperhaps to be expected. \n 6 \nWear Testing \nThe wear resistance of a material in general is determined primarily by the hardness of the material in \ncomparison with the hardness of other materials with which it comes into contact [2]. As such, the \ngreater hardness of the compositional components of the enamels used on ceramic tiles and for the \nsealing of ceramic tiles (principally SiO2, B2O3, Na2O and Mn) in comparison with epoxy tile grouts \n(principally CaCO3 and dolomite) probably results in improved wear resistance. However, wear \nresistance does not always increase with hardness [3]. Tests were therefore conducted in accordance \nwith Figure 4 to determine the exact difference in wear resistance between the conventional epoxy \ntile grout, the vitreous glaze on the ceramic tile surface and the enamel seal itself. In the case of the \nepoxy tile grout and the enamel seal the test samples were prepared as described in Section 2.1, \nwhilst for the ceramic tile the test piece was simply a 25 x 25mm section. The test samples, in all \ncases, were then adhered using a Loctite adhesive to an OPC substrate. The samples were then \nweighed and subjected to a friction force for 8 hours, being removed from the machine and weighed \nat two hourly intervals. \nFigure 5 shows the relationship between weight loss and the friction time for all three tests pieces. As \none can see, the wear resistance of the enamel seal is fractionally greater than that of the vitreous \nglaze on the ceramic tile surface. However, the enamel seal shows a considerable increase in wear \nresistance over the epoxy tile grout, with the weight loss being 4 times lower than for the epoxy tile \ngrout after 4 hours, and 8 times lower after 8 hours. \nPermeability Testing \nPerhaps the most important function of the enamel seal is it\u2019s capability of preventing harmful agents \nfrom permeating through it. In order to test the permeability of the enamel, comparison experiments \nwith conventional epoxy tile grout were conducted in terms of water permeability. The tests were \nbased on BS 6906 [4]. For the experiment, the ceramic tiles were cut into smaller pieces (20 x 20mm) \nand applied in pairs using a commercial tile grout to a ceramic tile substrate and allowed to cure for \n24 hours. The spacing between the vitrified edges of each tile pair was the industry recommended \n1.5mm. The samples were then filled in the conventional way with tile grout or laser sealed as \ndescribed in Experimental Procedure. A scaled glass tube 1.2m long with an outside diameter of \n12mm and an inside diameter of 10mm was luted and sealed completely onto the samples using a \nsilicone sealer and a Loctite adhesive. The tubes were then filled with water to a height of 1m so as to \n 7 \ngive a reasonable pressure head, and bunged to prevent any evaporation. Figure 6 details the \nexperimental set-up. The whole set-up was then weighed. The experiments were carried out in a \ntemperature controlled room held at 150C \u00b130C for 72 hours. \nOn completion of the experiments, measuring and weighing of the test equipment revealed that                 \nthe conventional epoxy tile grout had an average water permeability of approximately                              \n4.18 x 10-3 mg\/h.cm2, whilst the enamel seal displayed no measurable permeability. Such a result \nconfirms that, not only is the enamel seal fully amorphous, but that since there are no cracks or \nporosities in the enamel glaze or the interface between the enamel glaze and the borosilicate glass tile \nsurface, it is reasonable to assume that a continuous impervious surface has therefore been created \nacross the surface of the tiles and the seal.   \nCorrosion Resistance Testing \nTiled surfaces are often subjected to corrosive substances; as part of the normal service environment \nand\/or as a result of routine cleaning. Therefore corrosion resistance tests based upon BS 6431 [5] \nwere conducted using nitric acid, sodium hydroxide and Premier Products MP9 detergent cleaner. \nThe experiments were carried out by dropping small amounts of the corrosive agents in the \nconcentration ratios of 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 10% on to the surface of the epoxy tile grout, the \nAOCG and the enamel seal at hourly intervals for four hours. The samples were then examined \noptically and mechanically tested in terms of compressive strength and wear. High concentrations of \nthe various corrosive agents were used principally to accelerate the tests. However, in practice 60% \nnitric acid is used within the nuclear processing industry as a solvent for nuclear fuels, whilst within \nthe food processing and brewing industries, tiled surfaces are washed repeatedly many times a day \nwith detergent cleaners [6].  \nAll three substances in the concentrations 80%, 60% and 40% were seen to immediately attack the \nepoxy tile grout surface, with the nitric acid and sodium hydroxide attacking with greater severity \nthan the detergent, whilst the enamel seal displayed no discernible microstructural changes or signs \nof divitrification due to corrosion. Also, it was seen that the AOCG displayed a similar resistance to \nreagent exposure as the enamel seal. This similar acid resistance of the AOCG with the enamel seal \nindicates that a seal comprising of the AOCG with a laser gazed enamel coating could function \ncorrectly in situ, even if the enamel coating became damaged. Figure 7 (a, b and c) shows the surface \ncondition of the epoxy tile grout before and after exposure to all three reagents at 80% concentration. \n 8 \nTests conducted according to ASTM C579-91 [7] revealed that exposure of the epoxy tile grout to the \nreagents had a significant effect upon the compressive strength and the wear resistance of the epoxy \ngrout. As Figure 8 shows, exposure of the epoxy grout to nitric acid and sodium hydroxide in the \nconcentrations 40-80% resulted in an average loss of compressive strength of approximately           \n35-71%. In the case of the detergent a significant loss in compressive strength only occurred with \nconcentrations above 40%. Here the average loss in compressive strength for concentrations in the \nrange 60-80% was approximately 15-30%. This compares with no discernible difference in either the \nwear resistance or the compressive strength of the AOCG, and for the enamel seal, neither the wear \nresistance nor the rupture strength. \nFigure 9 shows the variation in wear resistance of the epoxy tile grout when exposed to the reagents \nwith an 80% concentration. As one can see, the wear resistance is significantly affected, particularly \nthrough interaction with the nitric acid and the sodium hydroxide. Here the weight loss was \napproximately 5 times higher than for the unexposed epoxy tile grout after 4 hours, and \napproximately 10 times higher after 8 hours for both acids. In the case of the detergent the weight \nloss was twice as high as that recorded for the unexposed epoxy tile grout after 4 hours, and 5 times \nhigher after 8 hours. \nDISCUSSION \nAs the results of the mechanical and chemical tests show, the enamel seal significantly out performed \nthe conventional epoxy tile grout in all the test areas. Indeed, in many instances the performance of \nthe enamel seal approached, and occasionally surpassed, that of the ceramic tiles themselves. \nMoreover, the superior mechanical and chemical performance of the enamel seal over conventional \nepoxy grout suggests that the life characteristics of the enamel seal are also superior to those of \nconventional epoxy grout. This was especially true in the case of chemical resistance and water \npermeability, where the enamel seal proved to be resistant to both. This marked variation in corrosion \nresistance is due to the difference in composition of the epoxy tile grout and the AOCG and enamel. \nThe epoxy tile grout consists largely of limestone and dolomite which are readily attacked by acids. \nIn contrast, the inherently relatively high contents of SiO2 and B2O3 in the AOCG and enamel \ncomposition ensure an increase in acid resistance [1]. The difference in permeability performance is \ndue to the contrasts in structure of the epoxy tile grout and the enamel seal; with the epoxy tile grout \n 9 \nbeing comprised of a porous pollycrystalline structure, whilst the structure of the enamel seal is of an \namorphous nature.  \nHowever, the in-situ relative thickness of the epoxy tile grout and the enamel coating must be \nconsidered in order to give a true interpretation of the actual life characteristics, particularly when \nconsidering the wear resistance (with and without exposure to corrosive chemical agents). Table 3 \nsummarises the wear rate details and the nominal life increase of the enamel seal over the \nconventional epoxy tile grout.  \nAs Table 3 shows, the enamel seal gives an increase in actual life over the epoxy tile grout regardless \nof the environment. However, as one can see, the increase in actual life of the enamel seal over the \nepoxy tile grout varies markedly depending upon the working environment. But, notwithstanding this, \nthe most common working environment for the enamel seal would involve contact with detergent \nacids, therefore yielding significant economic savings since such a tiled surface lasts around ten-\ntimes longer than one sealed with conventional epoxy tile grout. \nCONCLUSION \nThe use of a HPDL beam to produce a tough, inexpensive seal in the void between adjoining vitrified \nceramic tiles using the newly developed AOCG sealed with an amorphous, impermeable, crack-free \nenamel coating has been demonstrated successfully. Life assessment testing revealed that enamel \nseals had an increase in wear life of 2.9 to 30.4 times over conventional epoxy tile grout, depending \nupon the corrosive environment. Whilst the rupture tests revealed that the rupture strength of the \nenamel seal was comparable to that of the ceramic tiles themselves. Clearly, the economic and \nmaterial benefits to be gained from the deployment of such a more effective and efficient method of \ntile sealing could be significant. \nOptical inspection and water permeability tests revealed that a complete bond between the amorphous \nenamel crack and porosity free glaze and the tiles, as well as the laser treated AOCG substrate, was \nachieved. Mechanical testing of the seals revealed that there was little variation between the average \nrupture strength of the enamel glaze and the vitreous ceramic tile surface, 2.6 J and 3.0 J respectively. \nFor the enamel\/AOCG and the enamel\/ceramic tile the average bond strength was recorded as 60 \nMpa and 45 Mpa respectively. The average surface roughness of the seals and the tiles was 0.36\u00b5m \n 10 \nand 0.06\u00b5m respectively, whilst for the conventional epoxy grout (polished) the average surface \nroughness was 3.83\u00b5m. \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the EPSRC: Process Engineering Group (Grant \nNo. GR\/K99770), the EPSRC: CDP Group (CASE Award No. 95562556) and BNFL for their \nfinancial support.
