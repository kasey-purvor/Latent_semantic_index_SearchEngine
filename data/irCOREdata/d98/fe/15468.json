Introduction\n[2] The Longmen Shan region at the eastern margin of\nthe Tibetan Plateau, adjacent to the Sichuan Basin (Figure 1),\nis characterized by elevations of up to 7500 m above sea\nlevel and by topographic relief of more than 5 km over\ndistances of less than 50 km. The plateau margin has the\nsteepest topographic gradient of any edge of the modern-\nday plateau. It is deeply incised by tributaries to the Yangzi\nRiver, with local fluvial (valley floor to ridge crest) relief in\nexcess of 3 km and steep bedrock river channels [Kirby\net al., 2003]. Thermal histories derived from a variety of\nthermochronometers show rapid cooling rates during the\nlate Cenozoic and up to 7\u201310 km of denudation along a\nnarrow zone within the plateau margin, beginning either\n\u000320 Ma [Arne et al., 1997] or 9\u201313 Ma [Kirby et al., 2002;\nClark et al., 2005].\n[3] The origins of this extreme relief and rapid late\nCenozoic denudation, and the role of upper crustal faults\nin the evolution of the plateau margin, have been a matter of\ndebate [Chen et al., 1994; Kirby et al., 2000, 2002, 2003;\nClark et al., 2005; Richardson et al., 2007]. A network of\nsteeply dipping, generally northeast-trending faults have\nbeen mapped along the margin [Chen et al., 1994; Burchfiel\net al., 1995] (Figure 1). These faults accommodated signif-\nicant crustal shortening during the Late Triassic Indosinian\nOrogeny [Chen and Wilson, 1996; Li et al., 2003], which\nhas led to the identification of the Longmen Shan region as\na major thrust zone that was reactivated in the India-Asia\ncollision [e.g., Avouac and Tapponnier, 1993; Xu and\nKamp, 2000]. Folding and minor faulting of Cenozoic age\nhave been described in the westernmost Sichuan Basin\n[Burchfiel et al., 1995]. Geological evidence for widespread\nQuaternary thrusting, however, is sparse and equivocal\n[Chen et al., 1994; Burchfiel et al., 1995], and Global\nPositioning System (GPS) surveys constrain active shorten-\ning across the entire Longmen Shan to 4.0 \u00b1 2.0 mm y\u00021\nrelative to the Sichuan Basin [Zhang et al., 2004]. Cenozoic\nsediment is thin and discontinuous in the Sichuan Basin\n(Figure 2), with a maximum thickness of only about 500 m\nof Quaternary sediment adjacent to the Longmen Shan\nmountain front [Chengdu Hydrological and Engineering\nTeam, 1979, 1985].\n[4] The combination of high relief, low present shorte-\nning rates, and negligible Cenozoic accommodation gener-\nTECTONICS, VOL. 26, TC4005, doi:10.1029\/2006TC001987, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Institute of Hazard and Risk Research and Department of Geography,\nDurham University, Durham, UK.\n2Center for EarthquakeResearch and Information, University ofMemphis,\nMemphis, Tennessee, USA.\n3National Key Laboratory of Oil and Gas Reservoir Geology and\nExploitation, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.\n4Seismological Bureau of Sichuan Province, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.\n5Department of Geology, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg,\nVirginia, USA.\n6Department of Earth Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology,\nZurich, Switzerland.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0278-7407\/07\/2006TC001987$12.00\nTC4005 1 of 17\nation inspired Royden et al. [1997] to invoke lateral expul-\nsion of fluid lower crust from beneath eastern Tibet into the\nLongmen Shan region. This model of orogenesis, which has\nbeen elaborated by Clark and Royden [2000] and Clark\net al. [2006], implies primarily vertical movement of the\nplateau margin due to impedance of lateral flow by the\nthick, cold Yangzi Craton that underlies the Sichuan Basin\n[Lebedev and Nolet, 2003]. While the model provides\ncompelling explanations of many of the topographic fea-\ntures of the Longmen Shan region [Clark et al., 2006], it is\nnot clear how such large-scale late Cenozoic rock uplift has\naffected the network of faults along the margin nor is it clear\nwhether these margin-parallel faults may have also accom-\nmodated northeast-directed dextral simple shear during the\nIndia-Asia collision, as proposed by England and Molnar\n[1990]. The northwest-trending Xianshuihe and Ganzi\nfaults, southeast of the Longmen Shan, have accommodated\n\u000360 and \u0003100 km of sinistral displacement, respectively,\nsince at least 2\u20134 Ma [Wang et al., 1998; Wang and\nBurchfiel, 2000]. It is not known whether comparable dextral\nmovement has occurred on the margin-parallel faults.\n[5] We suggest that a necessary step in understanding the\nevolution of the eastern Tibetan Plateau is to document the\nlate Cenozoic activity and kinematics of the major faults\nalong the plateau margin. With the exception of work by\nChen et al. [1994] and Burchfiel et al. [1995], and a more\ndetailed study of the Min Jiang fault by Kirby et al. [2000],\nthis has not yet been done. In this reconnaissance study, we\naddress this shortcoming by presenting geomorphic evi-\ndence for late Cenozoic slip along several of the faults in the\nLongmen Shan and western Sichuan Basin. We use a\ncombination of techniques, including field mapping, image\ninterpretation, surveying of offset geomorphic markers,\ntrenching, and cosmogenic radionuclide dating. These\nmethods allow us to examine the history of fault slip on\ntimescales of 103\u2013104 yr, bridging the gap between the\ngeological and geodetic approaches that have been previ-\nously applied in the region.\n2. Geological History of the Eastern Plateau\nMargin\n[6] The present-day Longmen Shan region is roughly\ncoincident with the position of a Mesozoic collisional plate\nmargin that developed during the closure of Paleo-Tethys\nFigure 1.

Deformation began in the Late\nTriassic Indosinian Orogeny [Li et al., 2003] and continued\nthrough to the Late Cretaceous. During the collision, a\ncomplex package of rocks, including Triassic marine sedi-\nmentary rocks of the Songpan-Ganzi remnant ocean basin\n(Figure 2) [Zhou and Graham, 1996], was thrust to the\nsoutheast over the margin of the South China block,\ncreating a Late Triassic foreland basin [Burchfiel et al.,\n1995; Chen and Wilson, 1996; Li et al., 2003]. Shortening\nwas initially accommodated largely on the Wenchuan-\nMaowen and Beichuan faults but later migrated southeast-\nward onto the Pengguan fault (Figure 1) [Chen et al., 1995;\nChen and Wilson, 1996; Li et al., 2003]. Thus, most of the\nmajor margin-parallel faults visible in Figure 1 have existed\nsince at least Late Triassic time [Burchfiel et al., 1995; Chen\nand Wilson, 1996; Li et al., 2003].\n[7] In the Sichuan Basin, deposition of continental clastic\nsediment derived from the collision continued through the\nMesozoic and into early Cenozoic time [Ma, 2002]. These\nsediments are now capped by a widespread erosional\nunconformity that extends over much of the Sichuan Basin\n(Figure 2) [Burchfiel et al., 1995; Richardson et al., 2007].\nOverlying this unconformity is a poorly consolidated,\ngenerally clast-supported cobble to boulder conglomerate,\nup to several hundred meters thick, that is exposed along the\npresent-day mountain front at the western basin margin. The\nconglomerate contains granitic, metamorphic, volcanic, and\nsandstone clasts and is collectively known to Chinese\ngeologists as the Dayi Formation [Burchfiel et al., 1995].\nIt is commonly interpreted as debris-flow fan sediments that\nrecord the initial erosion of metamorphic and igneous\nbasement in the Longmen Shan to the west. While this\nrepresents an important time marker in the Longmen Shan\nregion, the age of the Dayi Formation is unfortunately very\npoorly constrained. Similar rocks exposed to the south of\nthe Longmen Shan region have been assigned depositional\nages of 4.2\u20132.6 Ma on the basis of magnetostratigraphy [Ji\net al., 1997; Jiang and Wu, 1999], although other authors\nhave suggested Quaternary ages [Deng et al., 1994].\nBurchfiel et al. [1995] considered the Dayi Formation and\nrelated rocks to be of probable Neogene age. Undisputed\nQuaternary deposits, which appear to be mineralogically\ndistinct from the Dayi Formation [Richardson et al., 2005],\nare limited to the westernmost Sichuan Basin and consist of\nthin (<500 m; Chengdu Hydrological and Engineering\nFigure 2. Simplified geological map of the Sichuan Basin and surrounding areas, modified from the\nwork of Ma [2002]. Heavy black lines show the major active faults in the Longmen Shan and western\nSichuan Basin, modified from the work of Ma [2002], Burchfiel et al. [1995], and our mapping. Note\nthat Tertiary and Quaternary rocks are limited to the westernmost Sichuan Basin, adjacent to the\nLongmen Shan.\nTC4005 DENSMORE ET AL.: ACTIVE TECTONICS OF EASTERN TIBET\n3 of 17\nTC4005\nTeam [1979, 1985]), low-gradient alluvial fans that radiate\nfrom the major drainage basin outlets.\n3. Methods and Techniques\n[8] There is some disagreement among different inves-\ntigators about the locations, names, kinematics, and activity\non the major margin-parallel faults in the Longmen Shan\nregion [e.g., Chen et al., 1994; Burchfiel et al., 1995; Chen\nand Wilson, 1996; Xu and Kamp, 2000]. In this paper, we\nattempt to synthesize these studies with our own field\nobservations at a number of sites in the Longmen Shan\nregion. Because of the scale of the region, the high local\nrelief (commonly in excess of 3500 m), dense vegetation,\nregionally poor exposure, and locally dense settlement and\nagriculture, this study is necessarily reconnaissance in\nnature. Rather than presenting exhaustive mapping of each\nstructure, we focus here on several key field areas where\neach fault can be observed and constrained.\n[9] The fault names that we adopt, and the locations of\ndetailed site analyses, are shown in Figure 1. From west to\neast, the primary margin-parallel structures are (1) the\nWenchuan-Maowen fault, (2) the Beichuan fault, (3) the\nPengguan fault, and (4) faults and folds in the westernmost\nSichuan Basin, including the Dayi fault. We focus here on\nthe margin-parallel structures that show the most abundant\nevidence for Quaternary displacement. While evidence for\nactive dextral slip on theWenchuan-Maowen fault (Figure 1)\nbetween Wenchuan and Maowen was noted by Burchfiel\net al. [1995], we were unable to find unequivocal signs of\ndatable, Quaternary displacement, and we do not discuss it\nfurther.\n3.1. Fault Mapping\n[10] We mapped the active traces of the Beichuan,\nPengguan, and Dayi faults using a combination of Landsat\n7 panchromatic and ASTER satellite imagery and Chinese\naerial photographs. These preliminary maps were used to\nguide focused field observations at specific sites where\ngeomorphic indicators of Quaternary activity might be\npreserved. In the field, we looked for standard landforms\nassociated with active faults: scarps or offset surfaces in\nQuaternary deposits, offset stream channels, shutter ridges,\nlinear valleys, and benches or beveled hillslopes. Where\nappropriate, offset landforms were surveyed using either an\nelectronic total station or a handheld laser surveying device\n(Laser Atlanta Advantage) and reflector, with a measure-\nment repeatability of better than \u00b110 cm. Positions were\ndetermined using handheld GPS receivers, and elevations\nwere taken from GPS measurements or from Chinese\ntopographic maps (scales of 1:25000 or 1:50000). Positions\nof field locations are given in Universal Transverse Merca-\ntor (UTM) coordinates (zone 48, WGS84 datum).\n[11] It is important to note that unequivocal slip sense\nindicators are very difficult to find in the region because of\npoor exposure of the faults. In addition, the steep terrain\nmeans that strike-slip displacement may lead to apparent\nlocal dip-slip offsets. With this in mind, we discuss our\nobservations below in terms of apparent vertical (throw)\noffset and rates. We regard consistent dip-slip separation\nacross a fault over scales of at least several to several tens of\nkilometers as compelling evidence for a dip-slip component\nof motion. In contrast, variable senses of separation on\nshorter length scales are likely to be localized responses to\nchanges in topography or fault strike.\n[12] While we use the names of the Beichuan and\nPengguan faults to refer to presently active structures in\nthe Longmen Shan, it is worth pointing out that these faults\nformed during the Late Triassic Indosinian Orogeny\n[Burchfiel et al., 1995; Chen and Wilson, 1996; Li et al.,\n2003] and that the presently active faults are largely, but\nnot wholly, coincident with the surface traces of the older\nstructures.\n3.2. Trenching\n[13] To establish the timing of the most recent slip on the\nPengguan fault, we excavated a 1.5-m-deep trench across\nthe fault at Qinshiping (331848\/3391429). Because we did\nnot find suitable piercing lines across the fault, our analysis\nof the trench was limited to the trench wall. One wall of the\ntrench was cleaned and logged at a scale of 1:10 following\nstandard procedures [e.g., McCalpin, 1996]. Age constraints\non the units exposed in the trench face were provided by\n14C analysis of charcoal fragments. We also partially\nreexcavated a trench across the Beichuan fault near Baish-\nuihe (386572\/3459531) that was originally dug and inter-\npreted by Zhou et al. [2007]. We collected several additional\nsamples for 14C analysis from one wall of this trench.\n3.3. Dating of Depositional Surfaces Using Cosmogenic\nRadionuclides\n[14] Most of the geomorphic indicators of fault slip in the\nLongmen Shan region involve deformation of depositional\nsurfaces or landforms, such as fluvial fill terraces or\nsediment fans. In the absence of well-exposed stratigraphy\nor abundant organic material, dating such landforms is\nnotoriously difficult. For this reason, we determined land-\nform ages by measuring the concentration of in situ cos-\nmogenic 10Be in quartz extracted from fluvial deposits in\nseveral locations. Samples consisted of either (1) amalgam-\nated depth profiles of several dozen granitic cobbles col-\nlected from the deposit surface and from various depths\nwithin the deposit, or (2) in one case, a sample collected\nfrom the top of a large (2.5 m) boulder buried within a\nsediment fan. For the amalgamated samples, several dozen\nfluvially transported granitic cobbles, with diameters of 4\u2013\n8 cm, were collected at several depths (\u00b10.1 m) between 0.3\nand 3.5 m below the terrace surface by sampling exposures\ncreated by recent construction within the deposits. We\nselected cobbles only from visibly stratified layers of\nobvious fluvial origin below the cultivated surface layer.\nEach cobble was crushed individually, and equal aliquots\nwere amalgamated into a single subsample from each depth,\nyielding an average 10Be concentration for that depth\n[Anderson et al., 1996]. Quartz was isolated from all\nsamples following a modification of the technique of\nKohl and Nishiizumi [1992]. Isolation of 10Be from quartz\nand measurement of 10Be\/9Be ratios by accelerator mass\nTC4005 DENSMORE ET AL.: ACTIVE TECTONICS OF EASTERN TIBET\n4 of 17\nTC4005\nspectrometry was completed by PRIME Lab at Purdue\nUniversity. The sample locations, measured 10Be concen-\ntrations, and model ages are given in Table 1. Also given are\nelevation, latitude, and horizon shielding correction factors\nused to determine the 10Be production rate, following the\nmethod of Stone [2000]. Horizon shielding was determined\nby measuring the compass direction and azimuth angle to all\nmajor breaks (for example, peaks and valleys) in the\ntopography surrounding the sample site, filling in straight\nlines between each measured point, and integrating this\nsimplified topographic profile to determine the fraction of\nsky shielded by topography.\n[15] The 10Be concentrations were translated to landform\nage using several methods. The age for the amalgamated\ndepth profile with one sample pair (DLS-1; Table 1) was\nevaluated using the sample pairs technique of Anderson\net al. [1996] on the upper two samples in each set. This\ntechnique corrects for the possible presence of inherited\n10Be that may have been acquired during erosion and\ntransport of the cobbles. An inheritance-corrected deposi-\ntional age, t, is obtained from:\nt \u00bc 1\nl\nln\nDP\nDP \u0002 lDN\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere DP is the difference in production rate between the\ntwo sample depths, DN is the difference in 10Be concen-\ntration, and l is the decay constant for 10Be. We use a\nmodification of this inheritance-correction technique for\nevaluating the results of XH-1 (Table 1), where three\namalgamated subsamples from different depths are avail-\nable. Given that the ages obtained on these samples are\nmuch less than the half-life of 10Be, we can safely ignore\ndecay. Hancock et al. [1999] related deposit age (t), depth\n(z), initial inherited 10Be concentration (Nin), and final\nconcentration (N[z, t]) in the absence of decay with the\nfollowing equation:\nN z; t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc P0t exp \u0002 z\nz*\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u00fe Nin \u00f02\u00de\nwhere P0 is the production rate at the surface and z* is a\ndecay length scale given by L\/r, where r is the density of\nthe overlying material and L is the absorption mean free\npath. We use a value of 150 g cm\u00022 for L [Brown et al.,\n1992]. We use equation (2) to obtain an estimate for both\nt and Nin through linear regression of the relationship\nbetween exp(\u0002z\/z*) and N(z, t), both of which are known\nfor each sample depth (Table 1).\n[16] For the surface samples GY-1 and GY-2 (Table 1),\nages were calculated assuming a constant production rate\nover the period of exposure. These samples likely have some\ncomponent of inherited 10Be, but this cannot be evaluated\ngiven the results obtained. The ages shown for these samples\nin Table 1 should therefore be considered maximum ages.\n4. Results\n4.1. Beichuan Fault\n[17] The Beichuan fault (also referred to as the Yingxiu-\nBeichuan fault) formed one of the major active thrusts\nduring the Late Triassic Indosinian Orogeny [Chen and\nWilson, 1996; Li et al., 2003]. Chen and Wilson [1996]\nargued that the Beichuan fault thrusts Mesoproterozoic\nbasement and metamorphosed Paleozoic rocks toward the\nsoutheast over generally unmetamorphosed rocks of the\nfrontal Longmen Shan. Burchfiel et al. [1995] showed that\nthe Beichuan fault both bounds and cuts the southern\nmargin of the Pengguan basement massif (Figure 2). They\nmapped the present-day Beichuan fault as a steeply north-\nwest-dipping structure that has accommodated late Ceno-\nzoic transpressive displacement through a combination of\nthrust and minor dextral movement.\n[18] On satellite imagery, the Beichuan fault can be\ncontinuously traced for approximately 200 km through the\nLongmen Shan region. Where we have examined it, the\nactive trace of the Beichuan fault appears to be steeply\nnorthwest dipping to vertical, and shows abundant evidence\nfor Quaternary dextral strike-slip displacement, with minor\nand locally variable components of dip slip. Below, we\ndescribe detailed observations from four separate sites along\nthe Beichuan fault.\n4.1.1. Gaoyuan\n[19] North of Dujiangyan, the Beichuan fault forms a\nlinear valley that extends northeast from the Min Jiang\nTable 1.

At Gaoyuan, the fault\nforms a prominent scarp trending 040, NW side up, across a\nsmall (\u0003100 m across) sediment fan (Figure 4). Vertical\noffset of the fan surface is 3.0 \u00b1 0.2 m within a narrow\n(10 m) fault zone.\n[20] We collected two sediment samples from the\nGaoyuan fan for 10Be analysis. The first sample (GY-1)\nconsisted of 34 granitic cobbles taken from the fan surface.\nBecause the fan appears to have been cultivated to a depth\nof approximately 0.8 m, this amalgamated sample should\nreflect an average 10Be concentration for the uppermost\n\u00031 m of the fan deposit. In addition, a single sample (GY-2)\nwas collected from the top of a large (2.5-m diameter)\ngranitic boulder protruding \u00031.2 m above the fan surface.\nThe amalgamated sample GY-1 yielded a 10Be exposure age\nof 4.2 \u00b1 1.0 kyr, while boulder sample GY-2 yielded a 10Be\nexposure age of 8.3 \u00b1 1.5 kyr (Table 1). Because the\ncosmogenic 10Be production rate decays exponentially with\ndepth, and because bioturbation and cultivation have mixed\nthe uppermost 0.8 m of the fan deposit, the age given by\nGY-1 is an absolute minimum estimate for the age of\ndeposition on the fan surface. In contrast, the large size\nof the boulder from which sample GY-2 was taken, and\nits depth of burial within the fan, makes it unlikely that\nthe boulder has rotated or otherwise moved significantly\nafter deposition. Because the GY-2 boulder may have\naccumulated an unknown concentration of 10Be during\ntransport to its current position, we interpret GY-2 as a\nmaximum estimate of fan surface age. Taken together, the\n10Be data imply a minimum apparent throw rate of 0.36 \u00b1\n0.07 mm yr\u00021 on the Beichuan fault at this site.\n4.1.2. Baishuihe\n[21] To the northeast of Gaoyuan, the Beichuan fault is\nvisible as a series of generally southeast-facing scarps,\ndextral stream offsets, and aligned saddles near the town\nof Baishuihe (Figure 5). Just north of Baishuihe, the fault\nforms a southeast-facing, 4.5 \u00b1 1.0 m scarp across an\nundated fill terrace surface, \u000360 m above the modern level\nof the Jian Jiang (Figure 6a). Several hundred meters to the\nnortheast, a small stream is offset 6.4 \u00b1 0.2 m in a dextral\nsense (385706\/3458591, Figure 6b). The dextral offset\ncoincides with a linear, southeast-facing scarp that is 0.5 \u00b1\n0.1 m high and trends 062. The stream is incised into\ncolluvium which drapes the fill terrace surface; therefore,\nthe stream offset is younger than the terrace offset. The\nstream offset suggests a strike-slip to dip-slip ratio of at least\n12:1 on the Beichuan fault at this location; given that strike-\nslip displacement of a sloping surface can also produce\nFigure 3.

A 2.5-m-diameter granitic boulder on the\nfan surface yields a 10Be exposure age of 8.3 \u00b1 1.5 kyr\n(Table 1), implying a minimum apparent throw rate of 0.36 \u00b1\n0.07 mm yr\u00021 on the fault.\nTC4005 DENSMORE ET AL.: ACTIVE TECTONICS OF EASTERN TIBET\n6 of 17\nTC4005\napparent dip-slip offset, we regard this as a minimum ratio.\nIn the absence of age control on the terrace or the overlying\ncolluvium, we are unable to assign a slip rate.\n[22] The fault can be followed toward the northeast\nthrough several linear valleys and aligned saddles to the\ntrench site in the work of Zhou et al. [2007], which sits in a\nnarrow, linear depression trending 038 and bounded to the\nsoutheast by a prominent shutter ridge (Figure 5). Note that\nthe sense of apparent vertical separation across the fault here\nis opposite to that at the locations in Figure 6, \u00031500 m to\nFigure 5.

[2007] concluded that the last\nearthquake on this section of the Beichuan fault occurred\nsometime after 11,770 \u00b1 360 yr BP, the youngest 14C age\nderived from their trench. While their trench was flooded\nand partially filled in when we visited in 2003, we managed\nto extract two wood fragments for 14C analysis, one from\nwithin the lowermost exposed prefaulting layer and one that\npostdates the last movement on the fault strands in the\ntrench. The lower sample yielded a measured radiocarbon\nage of >36,430 yr BP, while the upper sample yielded a\nconventional radiocarbon age of 7970 \u00b1 70 yr BP (Table 2).\nThese samples appear to constrain the age of the last\nearthquake along this section of the Beichuan fault to\nsometime between 8 and 12 ka.\n4.1.3. Donglingsi\n[23] Three kilometers northeast of the trench site in the\nwork of Zhou et al. [2007], the Beichuan fault cuts a large\nfluvial terrace at the village of Donglingsi (388495\/\n3461461, Figure 5). The terrace consists of a strath cut on\ngranitic bedrock that lies \u000315 m above the local riverbed,\ncapped by \u000325 m of gravelly fill. The Beichuan fault forms\na low scarp trending 047 across the southeastern margin of\nthe terrace surface. The scarp is northwest-facing and is\napproximately 0.9 \u00b1 0.1 m high (Figure 7).\n[24] We collected amalgamated samples of granitic cob-\nbles from the terrace fill for 10Be analysis. Samples from\ndepths of 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 m and 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 m below the terrace\nsurface yielded coherent 10Be results (Table 1) and are\nconsistent with an inheritance-corrected depositional age\nof 12.2 \u00b1 3.9 kyr. Given this, the minimum apparent throw\nrate on the Beichuan fault at this location is 0.07 \u00b1 0.02 mm\nyr\u00021. In contrast to sites closer to Baishuihe (Figure 5), here\nthe scarp is northwest-facing. Note also that, if this age for\nthe terrace surface is correct, it indicates incision of \u000325 m\nof fill and \u000315 m of bedrock since 12 ka, yielding a\nminimum bedrock incision rate in excess of 1 mm yr\u00021.\n4.1.4. Beichuan\n[25] Near the town of Beichuan (448080\/3521320), the\nBeichuan fault is clearly visible as a zone of subvertical,\nleft-stepping fault strands (Figure 8). Dextral stream offsets\nof tens to hundreds of meters can be found along each fault\nstrand. The fault is marked by a series of benches and linear\nscarps developed on fill terraces of unknown age, with the\nsoutheastern side consistently upthrown. This sense of\nvertical separation is also supported by the presence of an\nabandoned river valley, which begins at a hairpin bend on\nthe Jin Jiang at the active trace of the Beichuan fault\n(Figure 8). The valley, which is flat floored and up to\nseveral hundred meters wide, rises from Beichuan to a\ngentle saddle and then drops to join a much smaller\ndrainage basin to the south. Given the lack of a present-\nday river in the valley, we interpret the saddle as a wind gap\nand the valley as the abandoned paleochannel of the Jin\nJiang. Oblique dextral displacement on the Beichuan fault,\nwith the southeast side upthrown, appears to have allowed\nabandonment of the paleovalley and formation of the\nhairpin bend in the present Jin Jiang. At present, the Jin\nJiang flows \u000310 km northeast, parallel to the Beichuan\nfault, before turning southwest again and crossing the fault.\nTable 2.

Pengguan Fault\n[26] Like the Beichuan fault, the Pengguan fault was\nactive as a major crustal-scale thrust during the Late Triassic\nIndosinian Orogeny [Li et al., 2003]. The structure that we\ncall the Pengguan fault (Figure 1) was considered by Chen\nand Wilson [1996] to consist of two separate, colinear faults,\nthe Xiangshui fault in the north and the Guan Xian-An Xian\nfault in the south. Both faults are northwest-dipping and\nappear to involve thrusting of pre-Indosinian rocks over\nsyn- and post-Indosinian terrestrial sediments of the western\nSichuan Foreland Basin [Chen and Wilson, 1996]. Burchfiel\net al. [1995] showed a northwest-dipping thrust at the same\nposition (for example, their Figure 9) but did not name nor\ndescribe it. Neither Chen and Wilson [1996] nor Burchfiel\net al. [1995] made any mention of Quaternary slip along this\nstructure. Our observations, primarily from the two areas\ndescribed below, show that the Pengguan fault has been\nactive in the Holocene as a dextral strike-slip fault with a\nsmall and locally variable apparent dip-slip component.\n4.2.1. Shuanghe\n[27] The Pengguan fault is spectacularly exposed along a\nlinear, northeast-trending valley that extends for 15 km north-\neast of the town of Shuanghe (329390\/3389000, Figure 9).\nThe active trace of the fault is visible as a series of dextral\nstream offsets, benches, shutter ridges, linear valleys, and\nclosed depressions along several subparallel fault strands on\nboth sides of the valley. The Shuang He (He is also Chinese\nfor river) has an apparent dextral offset of \u00035 km; it flows\nsoutheast into the valley, turns to flow southwest along the\nfault, and then turns southeast again at the town of\nShuanghe (Figure 9). The fault strands show both north-\nwest-up and southeast-up senses of vertical separation; this\nlack of a consistent sense of dip-slip separation across the\nfault strands leads us to conclude that movement here is\ndominantly strike-slip in character. The fault appears to\ndextrally offset the edge of a cobble bar that sits above the\nconfluence of the Shuang He and the Xi He (333272\/\n3393382, Figure 9), but the offset is partially obscured by\ncultivation and we were unable to recover any datable\nmaterial from the bar or adjacent fill terrace remnants.\n[28] At Qinshiping (332065\/3391701), a prominent shut-\nter ridge forms an uphill-facing (southeast-facing) scarp,\ntrending 048 and 2\u201310 m high, which offsets several\nstreams and has led to local ponding of sediment upstream\nof the fault. A small stream at the northeastern end of the\nshutter ridge is offset by 27 \u00b1 2 m (Figure 10). To\nunderstand the recent history of faulting at this site, we\nexcavated a 7 \u0004 1 \u0004 1.5 m trench across the fault near the\nsouthwestern end of the shutter ridge (Figure 11). The\ntrench exposed six distinct sedimentary units (Table 3)\n(mostly sands and clays deposited behind the shutter ridge)\nof which three could be traced across the fault. We found\nevidence for two discrete faulting events on two separate\ngroups of structures. The first is marked by three faults\n(F1\u2013F3) that cut colluvium and the basal part of a wide-\nspread sandy clay unit (unit 3 on Figure 11); these faults are\nin line with the prominent topographic scarp at the surface.\nThe second event is marked by two separate faults (F4\u2013F5),\n3.5 m to the southeast, that cut the sandy-clay unit 3 but are\nFigure 8.

The Jin Jiang is now diverted at\nBeichuan and flows northeast, parallel to the Beichuan fault.\nTC4005 DENSMORE ET AL.: ACTIVE TECTONICS OF EASTERN TIBET\n9 of 17\nTC4005\nsealed by a distinctive upper layer that is rich in anthropo-\ngenic debris (bricks, tiles, and charcoal; unit 5 on Figure 11).\nThree 14C ages constrain the timing of the first event to\nsometime before 930 \u00b1 40 yr BP and that of the second\nevent to between 930 \u00b1 40 and 860 \u00b1 40 yr BP (conven-\ntional radiocarbon years) (Figure 11 and Table 2). Displace-\nment in both events involved minor (10\u201330 cm) dip slip,\nwith the east side downthrown. We cannot constrain the\nmagnitude, if any, of strike-slip displacement in these\nevents, but the local geomorphology of the site and the\nShuang He valley as a whole suggests that recent slip is\nlikely to be dominantly dextral. Thus, it appears that the\nPengguan fault has been active within the last thousand\nyears at this site.\nFigure 9. (a) Uninterpreted aerial photograph of the Pengguan fault near Shuanghe. See Figure 1 for\nlocation. (b) Interpreted photograph of the same area. Active fault trace is marked by thick black lines.\nU and D mark the locally upthrown and downthrown blocks, respectively.

Yongan\n[29] We also examined the Pengguan fault near the\nvillage of Yongan (446829\/3504427, Figure 12) in the\nnortheastern Longmen Shan. Here the Pengguan fault\nbounds the southeastern margin of the broad valley of the\nXi He. The active trace of the fault is visible as a linear,\nsoutheast-facing scarp trending 072 that cuts across the\nfloodplain and low fill terraces of the Xi He (Figure 12).\nNear Yongan, the scarp cuts a fill terrace of the Xi He and\nforms a 15\u0002 right bend over a distance of about 200 m. This\nbend is associated with an elongate sag pond and a local\nincrease in scarp height. Given this geometry, we interpret\nthe sag pond as a small pull-apart basin associated with\ndextral strike-slip movement through the bend.\n[30] At the eastern end of the sag pond, we measured a\nvertical scarp height of 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 m (Figure 13). To\ndetermine the terrace depositional age, we collected a depth\nprofile of three amalgamated subsamples of granitic and\nquartzite clasts for 10Be analysis (Figure 14). Subsamples\nwere collected from depths of 0.3 \u00b1 0.05, 1.7 \u00b1 0.1, and 3.0 \u00b1\n0.1 m below the terrace surface, which sits about 4 m above\nthe modern river bed. Linear regression on 10Be concentra-\ntion as a function of depth (expressed as exp[\u0002z\/z*]) of the\nthree subsamples, ignoring decay, yields an inheritance-\ncorrected depositional age of 4.2 kyr, with a significant\ncomponent of inherited 10Be (Figure 14 and Table 1). The\nerror on the measured 10Be concentrations is relatively high,\nas the abundance of extractable quartz in the samples and\nthe concentration of 10Be in that quartz are both low. Given\nthis, we conservatively estimate a model age error of \u00b150%.\nWhile the percent error is high, the absolute error in age\n(\u00b12100 yr) is small given the goals of this study. When\ncombined with the scarp height, the corrected depositional\nage is consistent with a minimum apparent throw rate of\n0.62 \u00b1 0.31 mm yr\u00021 on the Pengguan fault at this location.\n4.3. Deformation Along the Longmen Shan Mountain\nFront\n[31] Recognition of active faulting in the western Sichuan\nBasin is more difficult than within the plateau because of\npopulation density and intensive agriculture. Nevertheless,\nwe have observed evidence for late Cenozoic deformation at\na number of localities along the margin of the basin. While\nwe generally lack good constraints on the timing of defor-\nmation, our observations complement and extend those\ndescribed by Burchfiel et al. [1995].\n[32] Late Cenozoic deformation along the western basin\nmargin near the town of Dayi (358000\/3385100, Figure 15)\nis most often expressed as a localized zone (generally \u00031\u2013\n2 km wide) of steeply dipping cobble to boulder conglom-\nerate along the mountain front (Figure 16). While the\nmapped extent of Neogene rocks, including the cobble\nconglomerate of the Dayi Formation, is very limited [e.g.,\nBurchfiel et al., 1995], our observations suggest that, in fact,\nup to several hundred meters of conglomerate is exposed at\nnumerous locations along the mountain front between\nDujiangyan and Yaan and on the eastern and western flanks\nof the Xiong Po anticline (Figure 1). Where we have\nobserved it, the conglomerate is generally steeply south-\neast-dipping (up to 78\u0002) and appears to be subparallel to\nboth (1) the unconformity that defines the base of the\nconglomerate and (2) bedding in the underlying sandstone\nand siltstone, which range from Eocene Mingshan Forma-\ntion to Cretaceous Guankou Formation. Particularly good\nexposures of this relationship can be found at Mingshan\n(320061\/3338449), Jindong (350543\/3382169), and Jiezi\n(361477\/3410162) (Figure 1). Dips in both the conglomer-\nate and the underlying sedimentary rocks decrease to near\nzero within 1\u20132 km to the northwest. This localized zone of\ndeformation along the mountain front is probably correla-\ntive with the Southeastern Marginal Fault, a blind thrust\ndescribed by Chen and Wilson [1996]. The lack of a well-\ndeveloped angular unconformity between the conglomerate\nand the underlying rocks suggests that surface deformation\npostdates (Neogene?) conglomerate deposition.\n[33] Localized deformation along the mountain front is\nspectacularly exposed near Baitahu reservoir (365138\/\n3393735), \u000310 km northeast of Dayi (Figure 15). Excava-\ntion of a cemetery has exposed an \u0003200-m section through\ncobble conglomerate and the underlying Cretaceous Guan-\nkou Formation, just west of the mountain front (Figure 16).\nBedding in the conglomerate rotates from 003\/21E at\nthe western end of the exposure to 001\/46E at the center\nand 018\/78E near the eastern end at the mountain front.\nThe conglomerate is pervasively deformed, with numerous\nmeter-scale faults that show dextral strike-slip and thrust\nkinematics. At the mountain front, we observed several\nFigure 10. Map view of small channel offset by the\nPengguan fault at Qinshiping.

The presence of a surface-rupturing fault at Baitahu is\nsupported by a series of dextral stream offsets along the\nmountain front between Baitahu and Dayi (Figure 15).\nFigure 11.

Discussion\n[34] Taken in aggregate, our observations of active fault-\ning in the Longmen Shan region share two important\ncharacteristics. First, evidence for Quaternary dextral\nstrike-slip is ubiquitous on northeast-trending faults in both\nthe plateau margin and at the western edge of the Sichuan\nBasin. The zone of Quaternary dextral slip is broader still if\nwe include the Wenchuan-Maowen fault, as argued by\nBurchfiel et al. [1995]. These observations are in broad\nagreement with the model of distributed dextral shear\nbetween eastern Tibet and south China proposed by England\nand Molnar [1990]. Second, Quaternary vertical separation\nalong the faults examined here is generally small (on the\norder of a few meters), and its sense varies between different\nplaces and different fault strands over length scales as short as\nTable 3.

This variability would appear to rule out\nsignificant oblique (dextral-thrust) Quaternary displacement.\nThe Wenchuan-Maowen, Beichuan, and Pengguan faults\nwere all active in the Late Triassic as large-magnitude,\nnorthwest-dipping thrusts, with transport directions toward\nthe southeast [Chen and Wilson, 1996]. In contrast, Quater-\nnary activity along these faults has clearly been predomi-\nnantly strike-slip, and the simplest interpretation of these\nfault kinematics and the linearity of the active fault traces is\nthat the active faults are subvertical to vertical structures\nwhich may crosscut the older thrusts at depth. Given the\ncomplex network of faults in the Longmen Shan region\n(Figure 2) [Burchfiel et al., 1995; Chen and Wilson, 1996;\nMa, 2002], it is not clear how Quaternary deformation is\ntaken up at the ends of the structures that we have identified\nor how deformation is distributed in the complex region\nbetween the northeast-striking dextral faults of the\nLongmen Shan and the large northwest-striking faults of\nthe Xianshuihe system (Figure 1) [Wang et al., 1998; Wang\nand Burchfiel, 2000].\n[35] Quaternary slip rates on the dextral faults in the\nLongmen Shan remain largely unknown. Our 10Be data\nprovide direct evidence only for the apparent dip-slip\ncomponent of the displacement rates, which is variable\nand ranges from 0.1 to 0.7 mm yr\u00021. Given the widespread\nand compelling geomorphological evidence for a dextral\nstrike-slip to dip-slip ratio of at least 5\u201310 (and possibly\nmore), late Quaternary strike-slip rates are likely to be at\nleast several times greater. Active strike-slip deformation is\nalso permitted by recent GPS studies in the region [Zhang\net al., 2004], which suggest up to several millimeters per\nyear of active slip across the margin. Meade [2007] esti-\nmated fault kinematics and slip rates by inverting GPS\nsurface velocities from the GPS data of Zhang et al.\n[2004]; in his model, the Longmen Shan mountain front\nis characterized by aggregate dextral slip of \u00033 mm yr\u00021\nand convergence of \u00032 mm yr\u00021, broadly consistent with\nour geomorphic observations. GPS-derived rates of fault\nslip, however, are well known to be inconsistent with those\nderived or inferred from geological data, both in the India-\nTibet collision region [e.g., Wallace et al., 2004] and\nelsewhere [Dixon et al., 2003; Oskin and Iriondo, 2004].\nThe relative dearth of seismicity in the Longmen Shan\nregion [Chen et al., 1994], coupled to our observations of\nlatest Quaternary surface ruptures, suggest that the accumu-\nlation of strain may be more complicated than a simple\nlinear increase over time, which is the necessary assumption\nin requiring GPS-derived and geologically derived rates of\ndeformation to match.\n[36] The distributed nature of active dextral strike-slip in\nthe Longmen Shan region, and the lack of consistent\nFigure 14. Depth profile of 10Be subsamples from the\nXH-1 sample site near Yongan. See Figure 12 for location.\nLinear regression of exp(\u0002z\/z*) against 10Be concentration\nyields a model age of 4.2 kyr, with a significant component\nof inherited 10Be (Nin).

Pressure ridges and small-scale channel\noffsets near Baitahu reservoir yield dextral sense of offset.\nTC4005 DENSMORE ET AL.: ACTIVE TECTONICS OF EASTERN TIBET\n14 of 17\nTC4005\ndifferential vertical movement, provide further evidence that\nthe present-day topographic relief between the Tibetan\nPlateau and the Sichuan Basin is not due to late Cenozoic\nslip on upper crustal faults [e.g., Burchfiel et al., 1995;\nRoyden et al., 1997]. Kirby et al. [2003] used river profile\nanalysis to argue against focused, differential rock uplift on\nfaults along the margin, noting instead that river steepness\n(used as a proxy for rock uplift rate) appears to increase\nover a broad zone \u000350 km adjacent to the margin. The lack\nof direct geomorphic evidence for Quaternary crustal short-\nening lends credence to this argument. It seems clear that\nsome alternative mechanism of base level change must be\ninvoked to explain the high present relief of the plateau\nmargin.\n[37] The margin-parallel faults do, however, appear to be\nimportant in controlling the location of large northeast-\ntrending river valleys, and in this sense, they contribute to\nthe local (i.e., valley floor to ridge crest) relief in the\nLongmen Shan (Figure 1). Local relief of 3\u20134 km is\ncommon on the Min Jiang where it flows along the\nWenchuan-Maowen fault, along the Jian Jiang where it\nflows along the Beichuan fault, and on the Shuang He\nwhere it flows along the Pengguan fault (Figure 1). The\nmargin-parallel faults act as conduits along which rapid\nerosion can occur, driven by relative base level change\nbetween the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin\n[Richardson et al., 2007]. In this sense, the present-day\ndrainage system of the Longmen Shan region bears a\nstriking resemblance to that of the Swiss Alps, in which\nthe two largest rivers (the Rhine and Rhone) flow through\ndeep, orogen-parallel valleys, localized along old thrust\nfaults, before turning across strike to debouch into the\nforeland [Schlunegger et al., 2001]. The spatial coincidence\nof the margin-parallel faults, high valley relief, and large\namounts of Cenozoic denudation (up to 7\u201310 km; Xu and\nKamp [2000]) suggests, but does not demand, a causal link,\nwith the possibility that faulting and concomitant weaken-\ning of the upper crust has focused erosion along the margin-\nparallel valleys, promoting rock uplift of the plateau margin.\n[38] Finally, our observations of fault activity in the late\nPleistocene and Holocene have important implications for\nseismic hazard, particularly in the densely populated Sichuan\nBasin. We have shown evidence for surface-rupturing earth-\nquakes along the Beichuan fault since 12\u201313 ka, along the\nnorthern Pengguan fault since about 4 ka, and along the\nsouthern Pengguan fault since 930 \u00b1 40 yr BP. The timing\nof the last earthquake along the Dayi fault and associated\nstructures at the mountain front is unknown, but these faults\nshow some evidence for late Quaternary slip. An additional\nseismic hazard, not discussed here, is the possibility of\ncoseismic rupture on blind or partially blind faults under-\nlying the active Xiong Po and Longquan anticlines in the\nwestern Sichuan Basin (Figure 1) [e.g., Burchfiel et al.,\n1995]. With the exception of the 1933 Diexi earthquake\n[Chen et al., 1994] and the 1976 Songpan earthquake series\n[Jones et al., 1984], the Longmen Shan region has had little\nhistorical seismicity [Chen et al., 1994]. This study shows\nthat this quiescence may not be representative of the longer\ntimescales (\u0003104 yr) relevant to geomorphology.\n6. Conclusions\n[39] We have documented Quaternary activity on a set of\nlarge northeast-striking faults that parallel the eastern mar-\ngin of the Tibetan Plateau, using a combination of field\nFigure 16.

Clasts are dominantly subrounded-rounded\ncobbles of granitic rocks, with minor limestone and\nsandstone. Matrix is reddish-tan silty sand.

The\nnortheast-trending Beichuan, Pengguan, and Dayi faults,\nwhich parallel the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau,\nhave been active in the latest Quaternary with a dominantly\ndextral sense of slip. Apparent throw rates are highly\nspatially variable but are typically <1 mm yr\u00021. Compelling\nand widespread geomorphic evidence for dominant dextral\nstrike-slip displacement suggests to us that total displace-\nment rates may be at least several millimeters per year. The\nBeichuan and Pengguan faults have experienced surface\nrupture during the latest Pleistocene and at some locations\nduring the Holocene. The faults are sufficiently long to\nsustain a strong ground-shaking earthquake, making them\npotentially serious sources of regional seismic hazard.\n[40] Acknowledgments.
