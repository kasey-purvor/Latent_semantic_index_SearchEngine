Despite the challenging nature of the signals\nin these models the long-lived gluino can be discovered with masses above 2 TeV at the LHC. At a future linear collider\nwe will be able to observe the renormalization group effects from split supersymmetry on the chargino\/neutralino\nmixing parameters, using measurements of the neutralino and chargino masses and cross sections. This indirect\ndetermination of chargino\/neutralino anomalous Yukawa couplings is an important check for supersymmetric models\nin general.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nSplit supersymmetry [1] is a possibility to evade many of the phenomenological constraints that plague generic\nsupersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. By splitting the supersymmetry-breaking scale between the scalar\nand the gaugino sector, the squarks and sleptons are rendered heavy (somewhere between several TeV and the GUT\nscale), while charginos and neutralinos may still be at the TeV scale or below. This setup eliminates dangerous\nflavor-changing neutral current transitions, electric dipole moments, and spurious proton-decay operators without\nthe need for mass degeneracy between the sfermion generations. The benefits of the supersymmetry paradigm, in\nparticular the unification of gauge groups at a high scale and the successful dark-matter prediction, are retained.\nIn the Higgs sector, the split-supersymmetry scenario requires a fine-tuning that pulls the Higgs vacuum expectation\nvalue down to the observed electroweak scale. The extra Higgses of a supersymmetric model are located at the\nsfermion mass scale. This fine-tuning is obviously unnatural, but it may (or may not) find a convincing explanation\nin ideas beyond the realm of particle physics [2, 3].\nIn this talk (for more details, see [4]), we investigate the split-supersymmetry scenario from a purely phenomeno-\nlogical point of view. We ask ourselves the question whether and how (i) the particles present in the low-energy\nspectrum can be detected, and (ii) the underlying supersymmetric nature of the model can be verified. The two\ntasks require combining LHC and ILC data.\nThe low-energy effective theory is particularly simple. In addition to the Standard Model spectrum including the\nHiggs boson, the only extra particles are the four neutralinos, two charginos, and a gluino. Since all squarks are very\nheavy, the gluino is long-lived. The gluino can be produced at the LHC only, while the charginos and neutralinos\ncan be accessible both at the LHC and at the ILC.\nRenormalization group running without sfermions and heavy Higgses lifts the light Higgs mass considerably above\nthe LEP limit, solving another problem of the MSSM. Still, the Higgs boson is expected to be lighter than about\n200GeV. Apart from this Higgs mass bound, the only trace of supersymmetry would be the mutual interactions of\n1Heisenberg Fellow\n0205\n2005 International Linear Collider Workshop - Stanford U.S.A.\nHiggses, gauginos, and Higgsinos, i.e., the chargino and neutralino Yukawa couplings. These couplings are determined\nby the gauge couplings at the matching scale m\u02dc, where the scalars are integrated out.\n2. RENORMALIZATION GROUP EVOLUTION\nAlthough, in the absence of sfermions, the overall phenomenology of split-supersymmetry models does not depend\nvery much on the particular spectrum, for a quantitative analysis we have to select a specific scenario. To this end,\nwe note that the popular assumption of radiative symmetry breaking (i.e., a common scalar mass parameter for\nsfermions and Higgses) has to be dropped, and the Higgsino mass parameter \u00b5 is an independent quantity. Assuming\ngauge coupling unification and gaugino mass unification, we start from the following model parameters at the grand\nunification scale MGUT = 6\u00d7 10\n16 GeV:\nM1(MGUT) =M2(MGUT) =M3(MGUT) = 120GeV, \u00b5(MGUT) = \u221290GeV, tan\u03b2 = 4. (1)\nFor the SUSY-breaking scale we choose m\u02dc = 109GeV. Figure 1 displays the solutions of the renormalization group\nequations with the input parameters set in eq.(1) [4]. At the low scale Q = mZ , we extract the mass parameters:\nM1(Q = mZ) = 74.8GeV M\nDR\n3 (Q = 1TeV) = 690.1GeV\nM2(Q = mZ) = 178.1GeV \u00b5(Q = mZ) = \u2212120.1GeV (2)\nThe resulting physical gaugino and Higgsino masses are:\nm\u03c7\u02dc0\n1\n= 71.1GeV, m\u03c7\u02dc0\n2\n= 109.9GeV, m\u03c7\u02dc0\n3\n= 141.7GeV, m\u03c7\u02dc0\n4\n= 213.7GeV,\nm\u03c7\u02dc+\n1\n= 114.7GeV, m\u03c7\u02dc+\n2\n= 215.7GeV, mg\u02dc = 807GeV (3)\nThese mass values satisfy the LEP constraints. Virtual effects of a split supersymmetry spectrum on Standard Model\nobservables have recently been discussed in [5].\nThe neutralinos \u03c7\u02dc01,2,3,4 are predominantly bino, Higgsino, Higgsino, and wino, respectively. The Higgsino content\nof the lightest neutralino is hf = 0.2, so the dark-matter condition [6] is satisfied. To our given order the Higgs mass\nis mH = 150GeV.\ng1\ng2\ng3\nGauge couplings\n0\n1\n1 105 1010 1015\nQ [GeV]\n\u00b5\nM1\nM2\nM3\nMi [GeV]\n0\n500\n1000\n1 105 1010 1015\nQ [GeV]\n\u03bau\n\u03bad\n\u03ba\u2032u\n\u03ba\u2032d\nMixing parameters\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n1 105 1010 1015\nQ [GeV]\nFigure 1: Renormalization group flow of the gauge couplings (left), the gaugino\u2013Higgsino mass parameters (centre), and the\nanomalous gaugino\u2013Higgsino mixing parameters defined in eq.(4) (right). All curves are based on our reference point eq.(2).\nBecause we integrate out the heavy scalars, the neutralino and chargino Yukawa couplings deviate from their usual\nMSSM prediction, parameterized by four anomalous Yukawa couplings \u03ba.

LONG-LIVED GLUINOS\nSince the standard cascade decays of initial squarks and gluinos are absent in this model, there are only two sources\nof new particles left. The gluino is produced in pairs from gluon-gluon and quark-antiquark annihiliation. Pairs of\ncharginos and neutralinos are produced through a Drell\u2013Yan s-channel Z boson, photon, or W boson. These cross\nsections are known to next-to-leading order precision [7].\nUnless we have a-priori knowledge about the sfermion scale m\u02dc, the gluino lifetime is undetermined. Figure 2\ncompares this scale with other relevant scales of particle physics. Once m\u02dc & 103GeV, the gluino hadronizes before\ndecaying. The resulting states that consist of either of a gluino and pairs or triplets of quarks, or of a gluino bound\nto a gluon, are called R-hadrons [8]. For gluinos produced near threshold, the formation of gluino-pair bound states\n(gluinonium) is also possible and leads to characteristic signals [9].\nFor m\u02dc > 106GeV, the gluino travels a macroscopic distance. If m\u02dc > 107GeV, strange R-hadrons can also decay\nweakly, and gluinos typically leave the detector undecayed or are stopped in the material. For even higher scales,\nm\u02dc > 109GeV, R-hadrons could become cosmologically relevant, since they affect nucleosynthesis if their abundance\nin the early Universe is sufficiently high [1].\nIf gluino decays can be observed, their analysis yields information about physics at the scale m\u02dc and thus allows us\nto draw conclusions about the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking [12].\nWithout relying on gluino decays, there are two strategies for detecting the corresponding R-hadrons [4, 10].\n(i) The production of a stable, charged, R-hadron will give a signal much like the production of a stable charged\nweakly-interacting particle. This signal consists of an object that looks like a muon but arrives at the muon chambers\nsignificantly later than a muon owing to its large mass. (ii) While for stable neutral R-hadrons there will be some\nenergy loss in the detector, there will be a missing transverse energy signal due to the escape of the R-hadrons. As\nleptons are unlikely to be produced in this process, the signal will be the classic SUSY jets with missing transverse\nenergy signature.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the expected discovery reach for both channels, based on models for the R-hadron spectrum\nand the R-hadron interaction in the detector that we have implemented in HERWIG [13].\n4. CHARGINO AND NEUTRALINO YUKAWA COUPLINGS\nIf split supersymmetry should be realized in nature, the observation of the gluino, charginos and neutralinos will\nonly be the first task. Once these states are discovered, we will have to show that at the scale m\u02dc they constitute a\nsupersymmetric Lagrangian.\n0205\n2005 International Linear Collider Workshop - Stanford U.S.A.\nFigure 3: Gluino discovery reach at the LHC for (a) charged R-hadrons, (b) neutral R-hadrons, from [4].\n55 95\nM1[GeV]\nLHC\n150 210\nM2[GeV]\n-140 -100\nm[ GeV]\n3 5\ntanb\n-0.5 0.5\nk\nu\n70 80\nM1[GeV]\nLC\n173 183\nM2[GeV]\n-125 -115\nm[ GeV]\n3 5\ntanb\n-0.1 0.1\nk\nu\nFigure 4: Fit to 10000 sets of mass and cross section pseudo-measurements at the LHC (upper) and at the ILC (lower). The\nfitted parameters include only \u03bau with a central value zero. At the LHC tan\u03b2 = 4 is fixed.\nA quantitative trace of this is given by the off-diagonal elements in the mass matrices that derive from the\ngaugino-higgsino-Higgs couplings (4). They determine the mixing of gauginos and higgsinos into charginos and\nneutralinos as mass eigenstates. Simultaneously, they also constitute the neutralino and chargino Yukawa couplings.\nIn split supersymmetry, the renormalization flow below the sfermion scale m\u02dc induces non-zero values of order \u03ba\n(\u2032)\ni =\n\u22120.2 . . .0.2. If we are able to detect deviations of this size at a collider, we can both establish the supersymmetric\nnature of the model and verify the matching condition to the MSSM at m\u02dc.\nTo measure the neutralino and chargino mixing matrices, a precise mass measurement is necessary. This is possible\n(for mass differences, at least) at the LHC and, to a better accuracy, at the ILC. Without gaugino\u2013Higgsino mixing\nthe mass matrices would be determined by the MSSM parameters M1,M2 and \u00b5. The gaugino\u2013Higgsino mixing\nadds terms of the order of MZ and introduces the additional parameter tan\u03b2, leading to four MSSM parameters\naltogether.\nIn e+e\u2212 collisions, for the parameter set (2) almost all chargino and neutralino production channels have cross\nsections larger than 0.1 fb, and the threshold value for \u03c7\u02dc+1 \u03c7\u02dc\n\u2212\n1 production is as large as 1 pb [4]. The NLO electroweak\ncorrections to these production cross sections have been calculated in [15]. A linear collider with moderate energy\nand high luminosity would be optimal to probe all these processes, and some kind of fit is the proper method to\nextract the weak-scale Lagrangian parameters.\nWe compute the masses and the cross sections for all pair-production processes, with the exception of the \u03c7\u02dc01\u03c7\u02dc\n0\n1\nchannel. To all observables we assign an experimental error, which in our simplified treatment is a relative error\nof 0.5% on all linear-collider mass measurements [16], 5% on all LHC mass measurements [17], and the statistical\nuncertainty on the number of events at a linear collider corresponding to 100 fb\u22121 of data at a 1TeV collider after\n0205\n2005 International Linear Collider Workshop - Stanford U.S.A.\n173 183\nM2[GeV]\nLC\n-0.18 0.22\nk\nu\n-0.12 0.28\nk d\n-0.28 0.12\nk\nu\n \u2019\n-0.57 0.23\nk d \u2019\nFigure 5: Fit to 10000 sets of mass and cross section pseudo-measurements at a future linear collider.

For the first five lines,\nall but one \u03ba are fixed to zero, the fitted \u03ba has the central value zero. In the last four lines, all four \u03bai are fitted simultaneously.\nThe very last line assumes the predicted central values of \u03bai in our parameter point.\nall efficiencies.\nAround the central parameter point we randomly generate 10000 sets of pseudo-measurements, using a Gaussian\nsmearing. Out of each of these sets we extract the MSSM parameters by a global fit method. The fit results (see\nFig. 4, top) show that at the LHC we can extract the Lagrangian mass parameters with reasonable precision. There is\nsensitivity to one Higgs-sector parameter, which we can take either as tan\u03b2 or as one of the mixing parameters. If we\nfix tan\u03b2 = 4, the precision on \u03bau is sufficient to verify consistency with a supersymmetric underlying theory. However,\nusing LHC data alone, a simultaneous fit of all parameters gives only very weak constraints on the anomalous Yukawa\ncouplings (Tab. I), so no conclusions about the split-supersymmetry renormalization effects can be drawn.\nThe higher precision of measurements at the ILC, in particular adding cross sections as independent observables,\nallows us to improve the precision on a five-parameter fit (Fig. 4, bottom) or to simultaneously fit all Lagrangian\nparameters (Fig. 5). This is the proper treatment, unless we would have reasons to believe that some of the \u03ba\n(\u2032)\ni are\npredicted to be too small to be measured. The results for the precision in determining the anomalous couplings are\nlisted in Tab. I. (Note that in a complete fit, tan\u03b2 is no longer an independent parameter, so we can fix it to some\ngiven value.)\nThese results for the linear collider indeed indicate that we could not only confirm that the Yukawa couplings and\nthe neutralino and chargino mixing follow the predicted MSSM pattern; for the somewhat larger \u03ba\u2032i values we can\neven distinguish the complete weak-scale MSSM from a split supersymmetry spectrum.\nWhile the elements of the neutralino and chargino mixing matrices depend on the Yukawa couplings in a compli-\ncated way, the cross sections for chargino\/neutralino pair production in association with a Higgs boson are directly\nproportional to these parameters. Decays of the kind \u03c7\u00b12 \u2192 \u03c7\n\u00b1\n1 H or \u03c7\n0\nj \u2192 \u03c7\n0\niH would carry the same information,\nbut typically are kinematically forbidden in split supersymmetry scenarios.\nAssociated production of charginos and neutralinos with a Higgs boson in the continuum can in principle be\nobserved at a high-luminosity e+e\u2212 collider. The cross sections for some of these channels exceed 0.1 fb with little\nbackground [4], so with 1 ab\u22121 of luminosity we would expect some events of this kind to be detectable. However,\n0205\n2005 International Linear Collider Workshop - Stanford U.S.A.\ndue to the small rates for these processes, the achievable precision for parameter determination is limited. The\nmeasurement of masses and pair-production cross sections will be the key for establishing split supersymmetry as\nthe underlying physical scenario.\nAcknowledgments\nW.K. is supported by the German Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft, Contract No. VH\u2013NG\u2013005.\nReferences\n[1] N.
