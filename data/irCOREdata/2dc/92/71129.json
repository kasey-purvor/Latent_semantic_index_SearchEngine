Observations by incoherent-scatter radar have\nbeen applied to explore relationships between the fluxes of\nincident protons and the resulting D-region electron densities\nduring a polar-cap radio-absorption event. Using proton flux\ndata from a GOES geosynchronous satellite, the energy band\nhaving the greatest influence at a selected height is estimated\nby a process of trial and error, and empirical relationships are\ndefined. The height profiles of the effective recombination\ncoefficient are determined for day and night, and the transi-\ntion over the evening twilight is investigated for the height\nrange 60\u201370 km.\nThe results show that the day-night change is confined to\nheights below 80 km, night-time values at the lower levels\nbeing consistent with a balance between negative ions and\nelectrons controlled by 3-body attachment and collisional de-\ntachment. The daytime results confirm that, contrary to the\nprediction of some chemical models, a square-law continuity\nequation may be strictly applied. It is confirmed that, as pre-\nviously reported, the timing of the sunset change varies with\naltitude.\nKeywords. Ionosphere (Ion chemistry and composition;\nParticle precipitation; Polar ionosphere)\n1 Introduction\nIt is 45 years since D. K. Bailey identified solar protons\nof MeV energies as the cause of excess D-region ioniza-\ntion over the polar caps following some major solar distur-\nbances (Bailey, 1959). An important step in the argument\nwas to demonstrate that the relation between proton flux and\nD-region electron density could be explained using reason-\nable mesospheric parameters and appropriate reaction rates\nCorrespondence to: J. K. Hargreaves\n(j.hargreaves@lancaster.ac.uk)\nfor the essential chemistry governing the ionic reactions in\nthe mesosphere. Bailey\u2019s work was based on forward-scatter\ncommunication circuits, but most of the early observations of\nthese events were made with riometers observing the absorp-\ntion of cosmic radio noise (Hultqvist, 1969; Reid, 1974). The\nriometer measures the integrated effect through the whole ab-\nsorbing layer, and when observed in this way the event is\nknown as a polar-cap absorption event (PCA). Rocket flights\ncan provide the profile of electron density through the region,\nthough only twice during a single flight. The body of data\nhas, however, been considerably extended in recent years\nby incoherent-scatter radar (for example Reagan and Watt,\n1976; Hargreaves et al., 1987; Collis and Rietveld, 1990).\nRadar can provide continuous measurements, though there\nare limits to the sensitivity, particularly at the lower altitudes.\nOne practical problem is getting the radar operating for the\nevent if a run has not already been scheduled; in particular,\nthe start of the event has rarely (if ever) been observed by\nincoherent scatter radar. Satellite-borne detectors now pro-\nvide continuous monitoring of the proton fluxes within the\nmagnetosphere.\nIn relating the proton flux to the electron density the great-\nest element of uncertainty is the \u201ceffective recombination co-\nefficient\u201d for D-region electrons, \u03b1eff in the equation\nq = \u03b1effN2e (1)\nq being the electron production rate and Ne the electron den-\nsity. The production rate may be computed from the pro-\nton flux using the basic physics of ionization in air and an\natmospheric model. Thus, observations of electron density\nand proton flux during these events have been applied to\ndetermining values of \u03b1eff experimentally. Unfortunately\nthe values so determined vary widely (Penman et al., 1979;\nGledhill, 1986). Further determinations are therefore of in-\nterest, and the event of 28\u201329 October 2003 provides one\nsuch opportunity since the EISCAT radar in Scandinavia was\n3268 J. K. Hargreaves and M. J.

Proton fluxes in 9 energy bands, GOES-11, 28\u201329 October\n2003.\noperating and the proton fluxes at geosynchronous orbit were\nmonitored on GOES satellites.\nSome authors have presented empirical relationships be-\ntween the proton flux in a selected energy band and the total\nradio absorption or the electron density at selected altitudes.\nWe shall attempt this, also, for the event of October 2003.\n2 Observations and data\nOn 28 October 2003 a proton flare (type X17\/4B) occurred\non the Sun, peaking at 11:10 UT. In terms of its X-ray emis-\nsion it was one of the most intense flares of the present so-\nlar cycle. A coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed at\n10:54 UT, and within the terrestrial magnetosphere the flux\nof energetic protons began to increase at 11:50 UT. This flux\npeaked at 00:15 UT on 29 October, and the event ended about\n13:10 UT on 1 November.\nFig. 3. Cosmic-noise absorption observed by riometers in Scan-\ndinavia, 28\u201329 October 2003, covering invariant latitudes 65\u00b77,\n64\u00b78, 63\u00b77, 62\u00b78, 61\u00b72, and 58.7\u25e6, respectively. The riometers\nat Rovaniemi and Jyvaskyla\u00a8 operate at 32\u00b74 MHz, Kilpisja\u00a8rvi at\n38\u00b72 MHz, and the others at 30\u00b70 MHz. The vertical dotted lines\nshow morning and evening twilight.\nThe fluxes of protons exceeding 1, 5, 10, 30, 50 and\n100 MeV observed by the geosynchronous satellite GOES-\n11 (longitude 113\u25e6 W) are shown in Fig. 1. The increase in\nthe flux at the lower energies in the morning of 29 October\nwas associated with the arrival of the CME, and the sharp\nincrease at the higher energies late that day was due to a sec-\nond flare. Figure 2 shows how the flux varied in 9 energy\nchannels covering the range from 0\u00b74 MeV to >700 MeV.\nRiometers in Scandinavia (Fig. 3) indicated absorption in\nthe PCA rising to about 3\u00b75 dB on 28 October and 12 dB on\n29 October. The effect reduces towards the lower latitudes as\nfar as Sodankyla\u00a8, this marking the latitudinal cut-off which\nis characteristic of PCA (Bailey, 1964). The precipitation at\nlower latitudes shows the greater degree of irregularity typi-\ncal of electron precipitation. The localised event at 11:18 UT\nwas almost certainly the direct solar-flare effect (SFE) due to\nthe arrival of solar X-rays. The increased level of irregularity\nat the lower latitudes will be due, at least in part, to variations\nin the cutoff latitude (Birch et al., 2005).\nJ. K. Hargreaves and M. J. Birch: Proton influx and D-region electron density 3269\nThe 224 MHz EISCAT radar \u201cthe VHF radar\u201d (Rish-\nbeth and Williams, 1985) was operating at Tromso (69\u00b79\u25e6 N,\n19\u00b72\u25e6 E, invariant latitude 66\u00b73\u25e6, L=6\u00b72) from 08:15 until\n21:00 UT on 28 October and from 08:25 until 24:00 UT\non 29 October. The range 60 to 140 km was covered with\nresolution 300 m. The beam was either zenithal or directed\n30\u25e6 to the zenith. The basic sampling interval was 1 min.\nFor the present study the data were averaged over 5 min in\ntime and 1 km in height. Sample plots of electron density\nagainst time are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for 28 and 29 Octo-\nber. The times of ground sunset and solar zenith angle 100\u25e6\nare marked. Generally speaking, the day-night transition in\nPCA occurs between zenith angles 90\u25e6 and 100\u25e6. The gaps\nin these plots are due to glitches in the radar operation (that\nfrom 12:00 to 12:50 UT unfortunately concealing most of\nthe initial phase of the PCA). Some enhancements, particu-\nlarly at the greater heights, are probably the result of auroral\nelectron precipitation.\nThere are similarities between the plots of absorption and\nelectron density (Figs. 3\u20135), though the latter are much the\nnoisier. However, exact tracking is not to be expected be-\ncause the absorption is a height-integrated effect and also\nthe contribution to absorption by a given electron density de-\npends on the height. The most striking features of the absorp-\ntion plots are the large increase and subsequence decrease\non 29 October, the first occurring pre-sunrise but the second\n(which shows also in the electron density) being during the\nday and more related to the decline of proton flux after about\n09:00 UT (Fig. 2). The relation between proton flux and elec-\ntron density is explored in more detail in the next section.\n3 Empirical relations between proton flux and electron\ndensity\nSome studies of PCA events (e.g. Reid, 1970; Potemra,\n1972) have compared the absorption measured with a riome-\nter with the proton flux in some energy band as observed\nfrom a rocket or satellite above the atmosphere. These have\nprovided empirical relationships which have some general\napplication, for example in enabling the particle flux to be es-\ntimated from a measurement of the absorption, though they\ncan only be approximate in the general context because of\nvariations in the proton spectrum.\nCollis and Rietveld (1990) derived empirical formulae re-\nlating the electron densities at 60, 65 and 70 km to the inte-\ngral proton fluxes above 10 and 30 MeV. We shall attempt a\nsimilar approach in the event of October 2003, but now com-\nparing the particle flux in the bands shown in Fig. 2 with the\nelectron densities at selected heights. Although the fluxes\nin these energy bands generally rise and fall together during\nthe event, there are also variations of spectrum. Overall, the\nspectrum is usually more energetic at the beginning of a pro-\nton event and softens as the event proceeds. Superimposed\nmay be other variations due to the commencement of a mag-\nnetic storm or a second emission from the Sun. The spectral\nFig. 4.

The comparisons for 65 km by day are il-\nlustrated in Fig. 6. The dotted lines represent the reasonable\nassumption of a square-law relationship. In the daytime pe-\nriods of this event both the fluxes and the spectrum differed\nsignificantly between 28 and 29 October and the plot with\nbest continuity (by visual inspection) indicates which band\nis the main contributor to ionization at the height in ques-\ntion. Table 1 summarises the results for daytime, including\nempirical equations relating electron density to proton flux.\nThese equations should be of general application to proton\nevents other than this one. The heights most affected by the\nindividual bands are consistent with the calculated heights\nof maximum production rate for protons in the atmosphere\n(Reid, 1974), bearing in mind that the rate of recombination\ndecreases towards greater heights and that protons of a given\nenergy ionize above their stopping height but not below it;\nboth factors which tend to bias the effect upward.\nThis approach does not work well for the night periods. At\nthe lower heights the electron densities are smaller by night\nthan by day and those values are more scattered due to the\nsensitivity limitations of the radar. Also, it so happened that\nthe flux did not vary much between or during the night peri-\nods of 28 and 29 October, so no clear correlation could be es-\ntablished even at the greater heights. It was noted, however,\nthat the rather blobby distributions obtained for night would\nfit onto the linear distributions obtained for day at 80 km and\nabove, which suggests that the same law may apply by day\nand by night at those heights.\n4 Effective recombination coefficients\n4.1 Determinations using raw electron densities\nFrom the proton fluxes, production rates were calculated ev-\nery 5 km from 60 to 90 km, using the method of Reid (Reid,\n1986; Reid et al., 1991). This method takes the integral pro-\nton fluxes from GOES (as in Fig. 1), calculates the ionization\nrate as a function of height for particles of various energy, and\nthen sums over all energies and all pitch angles. The produc-\ntion rates at 55, 65, 75 and 85 km are illustrated in Fig. 7.\nWe note that before the arrival of the shock at about 06:05\non 29 October the ion production rate increases with decreas-\ning altitude. It actually maximised at 50\u201355 km, which is be-\nlow the range of heights covered by the radar. At the shock\nthe spectrum softened and thereafter the production rate was\nmore uniform with height, being within a factor of two over\n60\u201390 km.\nFigure 8 shows how the electron density varies with the\nproduction rate at 65, 75 and 85 km. These plots include\nthe day, transition, and night periods for the observations\non both 28 and 29 October. The dotted lines represent\nthe square-law variation (Eq.

Each plot\nshows a linear distribution extending over a range of q be-\ntween about 102 and 104 cm\u22123 s\u22121, these points being for\ndaytime. At each height Eq. (1) is obeyed over a variation of\nabout two orders of magnitude in the production rate.\nThe clump which appears lower down the plot for 65 km\ncontains the night-time points, the clumping being due to the\nlack of variation during the night periods on 28 and 29 Oc-\ntober. Points between these two groups are for the evening\nday-night transitions. (The radar was not operating over sun-\nrise on either day.) The diagrams for 60 and 70 km resemble\nthat for 65 km, though the amount of the day-night change\ndecreases with increasing height. The diagram for 75 km\nshows only a small change of \u03b1eff over twilight. That for\n85 km shows no twilight effect at all; the night and day points\nlie together and are consistent with a square-law relationship.\nThe same is true at 80 and 90 km, though the latter also shows\nsome irregular enhancements of electron density which are\nprobably due to ionization by auroral electrons at that alti-\ntude.\nTable 2 lists the median values of the effective recombina-\ntion coefficient from 60 to 90 km at 5 km intervals for 28 and\nFig. 8. Variation of electron density with production rate at 65, 75\nand 85 km: crosses for 28 October, diamonds for 29 October.\n29 October (taken together) and for day and night. The inter-\nquartile range is typically a factor of 2 for day and a factor of\n4 for night (all values being based on values of electron den-\nsity averaged over 5 min). The median values, each being\ntaken over about 100 points, are therefore subject to statis-\ntical error of about 3\u00b75% for day and 7% for night. At and\nabove 80 km, where there is no day-night variation, the statis-\ntical error will be about 2%. However, the uncertainties due\nto the calibration of the radar, or, indeed, to real variations\nin the medium, are likely to be larger that this. In this analy-\nsis, data affected by obvious malfunction or other phenomena\n3272 J. K. Hargreaves and M. J. Birch: Proton influx and D-region electron density\n(for example, electron precipitation) have been discounted as\nfar as possible. According to observations on the satellite\nCoronas-F over the polar cap (Panasyuk et al., 2004) a large\nincrease in relativistic electron flux (>1\u00b75 MeV) occurred co-\nincident with that in the proton flux. By reference to the com-\nputations of Gaines et al. (1995) it is estimated that the con-\ntribution to the production rate by the MeV electrons was no\nmore than 1% of that due to the protons at the altitudes of\ninterest.\nFigure 9 plots our best estimates of the effective recom-\nbination coefficient for day and for night, showing also the\ninter-quartile range. Results from some other determina-\ntions by other methods are included for comparison. From\n60 to 70 km in daytime there is good agreement with val-\nues recently obtained using an alternative method based on\nriometer data (Hargreaves, 2005). Between 60 and 80 km\nthe daytime values are also within a factor of two of Gled-\nhill\u2019s (1986) values, which were derived from a review of\nthe literature and expressed as an exponential function of al-\ntitude. Gledhill\u2019s night values, however, do not agree well\nwith the present results.\n4.2 Corrections\nThere are, however, some corrections which should be ap-\nplied. The electron density data from the radar are \u201craw data\u201d\nbased only on the intensity of the ion line in the incoherent-\nscatter signal. At low electron density the Debye length,\ngiven by\n\u03bbD =\n\u221a\n\u03b50kBT\nNee2\n(2)\nbecomes comparable with the wavelength of the radar, and\nthen the raw electron density derived from the ion-line inten-\nsity is reduced as\nN rawe =\n2Ne(1+ 2\u03bb\u2212)\n(1+ \u03b12)[1+ \u03b12 + (1+ 2\u03bb\u2212)Te\n\/\nTi] (3)\nwhere the parameter\n\u03b1 = 4pi\u03bbD\n\/\n\u03bbR (4)\n\u03bbR being the wavelength of the radar. \u03bb\u2212 is the ratio of neg-\native ions to electrons, and Te and Ti are the temperatures of\nthe electrons and positive ions. For the EISCAT VHF radar,\noperating at 224 MHz, the Debye length effect is not impor-\ntant if the electron density is large compared to 8\u00b74.107 m\u22123.\nWe can therefore neglect it in considering our present exper-\nimental data. However, the correction for negative ions be-\ncomes significant in the lower part of the D-region. Putting\n\u03b1\u001c1 and Ti=Te for the D-region gives\nN rawe = Ne\n(1+ 2\u03bb\u2212)\n(1+ \u03bb\u2212) . (5)\nThe presence of negative ions may increase the signal as\nmuch as a factor of two, the effect of which would be to de-\ncrease our estimate of the effective recombination coefficient\nby a factor of four. Where this effect matters we should call\na value derived using the raw electron density (i.e. one based\non the intensity of the ion line) the \u201craw effective recombi-\nnation coefficient\u201d.\nAs daytime values of \u03bb\u2212, Rietveld and Collis (1993) give\n0\u00b78, 1\u00b73 and 4\u00b70 at 70, 65 and 60 km, respectively. The cor-\nresponding values of N rawe\n\/\nNe are 1\u00b74, 1\u00b76 and 1\u00b78, and\n\u03b1raweff should be multiplied by factors of 2\u00b70, 2\u00b76 and 3\u00b72, re-\nspectively to get \u03b1eff at those three heights. The negative-\nion\/electron ratio at night is uncertain, but it is likely to be\nlarge compared to unity at heights of 70 km and below, im-\nplying that \u03b1raweff should be multiplied by a factor of 4 to get\nnight-time values of \u03b1eff . On the evidence of Fig. 8 negative\nions are unlikely to have much effect at and above 80 km.\nValues corrected by these various factors are included in Ta-\nble 2 and Fig. 9.\nIn the simple theory of recombination in the lower D-\nregion, the effective recombination coefficient, \u03b1eff , may be\nwritten as\n\u03b1eff = (1+ \u03bb\u2212)(\u03b1e + \u03bb\u2212\u03b1i) (6)\nthe first term in the second bracket representing the loss of\nnegative charge by electron recombination with positive ions,\nand the second term the loss via negative ions. The raw ef-\nfective recombination coefficient is then expressed by\n\u03b1raweff = \u03b1e(1+ \u03bb\u2212\u03b1i\n\/\n\u03b1e)\n(1+ \u03bb\u2212)3\n(1+ 2\u03bb\u2212)2 (7)\nFor the dominant reactions operating in the D-region,\n\u03b1e\u22485.10\u22127 and \u03b1i\u22655.10\u22126 cm3 s\u22121. If \u03bb\u2212 is small (say,\nabove 75 km by day and above 80 km by night) the recom-\nbination is dominated by reactions between electrons and\npositive-ions, and\n\u03b1raweff = \u03b1e (8)\nIf \u03bb\u2212is large (probably at and below 70 km by night),\n\u03b1raweff = \u03b1i .\u03bb2\u2212\n\/\n4 (9)\nand the recombination is controlled by ionic reactions and\nthe ion\/electron ratio.\nThe transition during twilight is discussed in Sect. 5.\n4.3 Discussion\n4.3.1 Negative-ion to electron ratios at night\nRietveld and Collis (1993) estimated the negative-ion to elec-\ntron ratio for daytime from measurements of the spectral\nwidth of the incoherent-scatter line, quoting values of 4\u00b70,\n1\u00b73, and 0\u00b78 at 60, 65 and 70 km, respectively. From Eq. (7),\nassuming \u03bb\u2212\u03b1i\u001d\u03b1e, and using the values of \u03b1raweff from Ta-\nble 2, we may estimate values of the recombination coeffi-\ncient \u03b1i . The results are 1\u00b76.10\u22126, 4\u00b77.10\u22126 and 6\u00b74.10\u22126, re-\nspectively. Although these values are within an order of mag-\nnitude, it seems unlikely that this coefficient decreases with\naltitude; if not constant, it would be expected to increase.\nJ. K. Hargreaves and M. J. Birch: Proton influx and D-region electron density 3273\nFig. 9. Day and night profiles of effective recombination coefficient determined from the proton event of October 2003. Raw and corrected\nvalues (the latter not being required at and above 80 km) are shown. The bars indicate the inter-quartile ranges. Values determined by\nGledhill (1986) and by Hargreaves (2005) using different methods are included for comparison.\nTherefore, for the purpose of the discussion, we will adopt\nthe average of the values for 65 and 70 km, giving 5\u00b76.10\u22126\nwhich is also consistent with the generally accepted value of\n\u201c5.10\u22126 or greater\u201d. From Eq. (9) and our night values from\nTable 2, we may now estimate values of \u03bb\u2212 for night, assum-\ning that the ionic recombination coefficient is the same by\nnight as by day. The results for 60, 65 and 70 km are respec-\ntively 48, 19 and 7\u00b74. If a larger value is assumed for \u03b1i , the\ndeduced values of \u03bb\u2212 will be smaller.\nOver the range 60\u201370 km the derived night-time values\nof \u03bb\u2212 increase by a factor of about 2\u00b755 for each 5 km de-\ncrease in height, implying an exponential variation with a\nscale height of about 5\u00b73 km, which is approximately the\nscale height of the neutral atmosphere in the mesosphere.\nThis result, which does not depend on the value of \u03b1i , is con-\nsistent with the night-time production of negative ions from\nelectrons being due to 3-body attachment and their loss to\ncollisional detachment.\n4.3.2 The form of the recombination law\nIn the simple continuity equation of D-region aeronomy, ex-\npressed by Eq. (1), the electron production rate and the equi-\nlibrium electron density are related by a square law. Despite\nits common usage, such a law is a gross simplification of\nthe chemistry of the D-region which is actually quite compli-\ncated, involving both simple and complex (or cluster) ions of\nboth signs. To attempt to represent the chemistry more ac-\ncurately, chemical models of various levels of sophistication\nhave been developed. One of the first was the 6-ion model of\nMitra and Rowe (1972) in which the complex ions were rep-\nresented as two single species, one positive and one negative.\nMore recent models (Burns et al., 1991; Kirkwood and Os-\nepian, 1995), which include more individual reactions, are\nconsiderably more elaborate. The first of those, the \u201cSo-\ndankyla\u00a8 model\u201d, included the reactions between 24 positive\nand 11 negative ions (and has since been elaborated further\n(Turunen et al., 1996)).\n3274 J. K. Hargreaves and M. J. Birch: Proton influx and D-region electron density\nFig. 10. Values of effective recombination coefficient computed\nfrom the Sodankyla\u00a8 chemical model of the D-region. (After Harg-\nreaves and Howarth, previously unpublished)\nWhen these models are used to compute electron densities\nfrom ion production rates, the continuity law that they pro-\nduce deviates from the square law at some heights and over\nsome ranges of electron density. The effect may be seen in\nthe results of Kirkwood and Osepian (1995) and of del Pozo\net al. (1997), for example. The implication is that the ef-\nfective recombination coefficient is not exactly constant but\nvaries with the production rate. Figure 10 (which is based\non computations using the Sodankyla\u00a8 model) illustrates the\npoint. Computed values of effective recombination coeffi-\ncient are shown over a range of production rates for several\naltitudes, according to which the effective recombination co-\nefficient at 70, 75 and 80 km decreases as the production rate\nincreases between 102 and 104 cm\u22123 s\u22121. It does tend to a\nconstant value at the greater levels of production rate.\nConsidering the large number of interactions involved in\nthe D-region, deviation from a simple continuity law should,\nperhaps, not be surprising. However, our present experi-\nmental results seem to show that the square law is actually\nobeyed remarkably closely if the production rate is in the\nrange 102 to 104 cm\u22123 s\u22121, and this must cast doubt on the\naccuracy of the computational models. In those models the\nrelative concentration of simple and cluster ions varies with\nthe ion production rate. The positive cluster ions (such as\nH+(H2O)n and NO+(H2O)n), are relatively more numerous\nthan the simple ions (such as NO+) at the lower production\nrates but become relatively less numerous as the production\nrate increases. The cluster ions, being physically larger, re-\ncombine more rapidly than the simple ions with electrons,\nand thus the models predict that the effective recombination\nrate decreases as the production rate increases. The discrep-\nancy with experiment suggests that the complex ions have\nless effect on the overall electron loss rate than has been sup-\nposed.\nFig. 11.

Since the absorption reduces during twilight the plot shows\nthe ratio (daytime value)\/(twilight value). The values have been\ncorrected for the computed variation of production rate at 55 km.\n5 The sunset twilight period\nThe nature of the transition between day and night conditions\nis an intriguing problem of the D-region. The timing and\npattern of the change is unlike that of the main ionospheric\nlayers, occurring rather sharply over a short period just be-\nfore ground sunrise and during a period following ground\nsunset. This phenomenon is well known in VLF propaga-\ntion (Bracewell and Bain, 1952; Hargreaves, 1962) as well\nas in polar-cap absorption. Clearly, the basic mechanism\nmust be photochemical, but the controlling agent cannot be\na solar radiation that is strongly absorbed in the upper at-\nmosphere, which rules out X-rays and extreme ultra-violet\n(EUV). Since the change occurs while the Sun is at very low\nelevation and mainly while it is actually below the horizon,\nattention turned to visible light or some other radiation that\nwas only weakly absorbed in the atmosphere. Attempts to\nJ. K. Hargreaves and M. J. Birch: Proton influx and D-region electron density 3275\nexplain the observations include the hypothesis of a screen-\ning layer which fully absorbs the effective radiation below\nsome altitude but not above it. The question is discussed by\nAdams and Megill (1967) and by Reid (1974) among others.\nIn Fig. 11 we show the change in the effective recombina-\ntion coefficient (as defined by Eq. (1)) at 60, 65 and 70 km\nduring sunset twilight, taking account of the observations on\nboth 28 and 29 October. The variation of the radio absorp-\ntion observed by the riometer at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi (see Fig. 3) on\nthese days is also shown. The latter will of course be af-\nfected by the change in proton flux as well as by the chem-\nistry, and therefore the absorption has been corrected to a\nconstant production rate at 55 km (Fig. 7). The pattern of ab-\nsorption is most similar to that of the effective recombination\ncoefficient at 60 km in Fig. 11(a).\nCollis and Rietveld (1990), in their study of the PCAs\nof October 1989, reported that the timing of the day\/night\ntransition depended on the altitude being observed. In the\nevening the change was found to be delayed linearly with\nincreasing altitude, the solar depression angle at the onset\nof the transition increasing by about 4\u00b75\u25e6 for each 10 km in-\ncrease in altitude. The present results for October 2003 con-\nfirm this effect, the delay here being equivalent to about 6\u25e6\nof solar depression per 10 km of altitude.\nFigure 11 also shows how the altitude of the Earth\u2019s\nshadow overhead varies with the solar depression angle. Al-\nthough the Sun is below the horizon at ground level during\nmost of the transition, the layers of the D-region are still sun-\nlit when the twilight change begins. The 60 and 65 km levels\nalso remain sunlit throughout all or most of the change. (This\nis the kind of observation which suggests the existence of a\nscreening layer.) However, since the solar depression angle\nneeds to increase by less than one degree to lift the shadow\nby 10 km at D-region heights, it is doubtful whether the ob-\nserved delays can be explained in terms of the movement of\nthe Earth\u2019s shadow, with or without a screening layer.\nIt is clear from the discussion of Sect. 4.2 that the changes\nshown in Fig. 11 are the effects of a changing negative-\nion\/electron ratio during twilight, as an increasing fraction\nof the negative charge moves from electrons to negative ions.\nIf we assume that \u03bb\u2212.\u03b1i\u001d\u03b1e and take a value (5\u00b76.10\u22126) for\n\u03b1i , we may estimate how \u03bb\u2212 changes during twilight. Equa-\ntion (9) applies over most of the transition but Eq. (7) has to\nbe used if \u03bb\u2212 is smaller than about 5. The result is shown\nfor 60, 65 and 70 km in Fig. 12, on which the typical day and\nnight values are also marked.\n6 Conclusions\n\u2013 Empirical relations have been derived between proton\nflux and electron density during the PCA of 28\u201329 Oc-\ntober 2003. It is found that the flux in the energy band\n4\u20139 MeV has greatest control over the range 70\u201385 km.\nThe most effective bands are 9\u201340 MeV at 65 km and\n40\u201380 MeV at 60 km;\nFig. 12. Estimated variation of the concentration ratio of negative\nions to electrons during evening twilight.\n\u2013 Values of effective recombination coefficient have been\ndetermined for day and night. There is no day-night\nchange at or above 80 km, but below that level the\nday-night change becomes progressively larger with de-\ncreasing altitude. The height variation of the coefficient\nat night is consistent with negative-ion production by a\n3-body process and loss by collisional detachment;\n\u2013 The observations do not support other than a square law\nof recombination. There is no evidence of the devia-\ntion from the square law which is predicted by chemical\nmodels;\n\u2013 The timing of the sunset transition is such that the solar\ndepression angle at the onset of the effect varies linearly\nwith the height considered, supporting the earlier report\nby Collis and Rietveld (1990). It does not appear feasi-\nble to explain the timing of the twilight effect in terms\nof a single \u201cscreening layer\u201d. Values for the negative-\nion\/electron ratio are estimated for night and during the\nsunset change.\nAcknowledgements. We thank H. H. Sauer for providing the GOES\nproton fluxes and G. C.
