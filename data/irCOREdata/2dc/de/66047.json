One line in anthropological thought leads to cultural rela-\ntivism and an awareness that a cloud of alternative possibilites\nsurrounds any moral code. However, a second line, based in re-\nflection on fieldwork and on the professional ethics arising with\nit, does suggest some basic moral aesthetic standards, including\ntrust, mutual forbearance, and acceptance of others\u2019 worth.\nMoreover, a third line, that investigating the sources of social\nchange and cultural metamorphosis, suggests that moral agency-\ncum-patiency\u2014doing-and-being-done-to in the web of social rela-\ntions\u2014is a basic category of human thought and existence and\nthat moral rhetorical persuasion of agents-cum-patients is like-\nwise a constituent of all cultural arrangements. These reflections\ngive sociocultural anthropologists support, based in the moral\nlogic of the discipline itself and in its understanding of the com-\nplexity of possibilities surrounding any moral judgment, for scep-\ntical and therapeutic criticism of rhetoric exercised in pursuit of\nempire. This argument is illustrated through an analysis of\nAmerican political rhetoric supporting the invasion of Iraq.\nm i c h a e l c a r r i t h e r s is Professor of Anthropology at the\nUniversity of Durham (43 Old Elvet, Durham DH1 3HN, U.K.\n[m.b.carrithers@durham.ac.uk]). Born in 1945, he was educated at\nWesleyan University (B.A., 1967; M.A., 1971) and at Oxford Uni-\nversity (D.Phil., 1978). He has taught at the London School of\nEconomics and at Oxford and has done fieldwork in Sri Lanka,\nIndia, and Germany. Among his publications are The Forest\nMonks of Sri Lanka (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1983), Why\nHumans Have Cultures (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992),\nand the edited volume (with Steven Lukes and Steven Collins)\nThe Category of the Person (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 1985). The present paper was submitted 16 x 03 and ac-\ncepted 1 xi 04.\n1. I thank the Public Culture Research Group in the Anthropology\nDepartment at the University of Durham for their lively, construc-\ntive, and very interesting discussion of these ideas. I hope that the\nfinal version matches their expectations.\nIn a key chapter near the beginning of The Man without\nQualities, Robert Musil introduces both the perspective\nfrom which the book is written and his chief character,\nUlrich, the Man without Qualities himself. To render\nUlrich\u2019s peculiar attitude to life clear, he contrasts him\nwith his father, the old Professor, a man of impeccable\nsocial judgment who has adroitly inserted himself, by\nmany acts of tact and self-effacing support for the aris-\ntocracy, into the very heart of the pre-1914 Austrian rul-\ning class (Musil 1978 [1930, 1933]:16, my translation):\nIf you want to walk easily through opened doors,\nyou need to be aware of the fact that they have a\nfirm frame: this principle, according to which the\nold Professor had lived, is simply a demand of the\nsense of reality. But if there is a sense of reality, and\nno one will doubt that its existence is justified, then\nthere must also exist something which can be called\na sense of possibility.\nWhoever possesses a sense of possibility does not,\nfor example, say: here this or that happened, will\nhappen, or is bound to happen; rather he fantasizes\nthat here something could, might or should happen.\nAnd if someone explains to him of something that it\nis thus, and how it is, then he thinks: now it could\nprobably be otherwise. Thus the sense of possibility\nmay be defined practically as the ability to think of\nwhat could just as well be the case, and not to take\nthat which is as more important than that which is\nnot. One sees that the effects of such a creative tal-\nent can be remarkable, and regrettably they may\nsometimes allow that which people admire to ap-\npear as false, and that which they forbid to appear as\npermissible.\nUlrich is blessed, or cursed, with this sense of possibility,\nwhich makes him the Man without Qualities (or, better,\nthe Man without Fixed Characteristics), the man who\nunderstands that he and others could always do and be\notherwise. This idea of possibilities is, I think, a profound\nand pregnant observation, central to the world of the\nnovel but central too to our conception of the world of\nthe decaying Austrian empire and of the world of Amer-\nican empire today. I think, too, that such an understand-\ning through possibilities goes to the heart of anthropol-\nogy and its place in a world of empire and of seeming\nand being.\nMusil defines the sense of possibility as \u201cthe ability\nto think what could just as well be the case, and not to\ntake that which is as more important than that which\nis not.\u201d In the novel he wields this faculty continuously,\nand the effect is that of a sort of hallucinatory ethnog-\nraphy, a revelation of a world whose customs, values,\nsocial arrangements, and everyday experience are seen\nas from a fourth dimension, as we three-dimensional an-\nimals might look with pity on the inhabitants of Flat-\nland. We know that all the erections and projects of the\nimperial and royal state would come to an end through\nbloody war and therefore that the firm frames and sense\nof reality of the movers of empire would prove the merest\ntissue of gossamer against time\u2019s assaults. The contrast\n434 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nbetween perceived solidity and actual mutability is cap-\ntured in this description of the character Count Leinsdorf\n(Musil 1978 [1930, 1933]:445):\nThe train of time is a train that rolls out its tracks\nin front of itself. The river of time is a river that\ncarries its own banks along with it. The traveler\nmoves between firm walls, on firm ground; but, im-\nperceptibly, ground and walls are moved vigorously\nby the traveler. . . . Count Leinsdorf was protected\nagainst [this realization]. He was protected from it\nby the conviction that he pursued Realpolitik.\nTo what extent is anthropological knowledge like Mu-\nsil\u2019s knowledge, not a knowledge of structures alone but\nalso of spacious possibilities and of unintended conse-\nquences that crowd closely around certainty and lift it\naway from solidity? I should stress that I regard this ques-\ntion as having moral implications as well, as concerning\n\u201cthat which people admire and that which they forbid.\u201d\nMusil and his coolly ironic central character may seem\nto hover above the world of the novel and any supposed\nactual world and therefore beyond questions of morality.\nBut that there are moral implications is clear enough\nfrom the pointed, even sometimes bitter, tone, and, in-\ndeed, the moral implications were recognized, if in a\nbackhanded way, by both the Nazis and the (early)\nGerman Democratic Republic, who banned the book.\nDoes anthropological knowledge too bear an inescapable\nmoral burden? And are we not able to speak, as anthro-\npologists, rather than as, say, citizens of this country or\nthat or of the world, on moral issues of burning import\ntoday?\nThe Argument\nThe first question\u2014whether anthropology is or could be\na knowledge of possibilities and not just of certainties\u2014\nopens, I believe, onto an expansive and promising vista.\nIt is true that anthropologists, like all scholars, write\nassertively, in declarative mood, and trade in (social)\nstructures and firm (cultural) frames. Yet the discipline\nis tinged from the root by the subjunctive mood: given\nthe unity of humankind and the evident malleability of\nour species, anyone could have been someone else, those\nin any one sociocultural order could have participated\nin any other. That subjunctive lays the path to the eth-\nnographic work of empathy\u2014\u201cI could have stood in your\nshoes\u201d\u2014and onwards to the axiom of the comparability\nof one society with another. Latterly that fundamental\nsense of possibility has been amplified by the growing\nconviction that any particular sociocultural arrangement\nis mutable, labile, far less determining or determined,\nfar more historically contingent than we had thought:\neven the rules, anywhere, could have been different and\nare becoming different. It is as if the arc of cultures which\nRuth Benedict invoked had turned out to be fractal in\nnature, each culture dissolving to display further arcs of\npossibilities and alternatives.\nAs against this vision the second question\u2014whether\nanthropological knowledge can ground moral judg-\nment\u2014may seem at first to have little weight. You might\nsay: anthropologists should display the varieties of moral\nimagination, as Geertz (1977) argued many years ago, but\nthey may not judge them. Indeed, we must not judge,\nsince suspension of judgment is the sine qua non of suc-\ncessful ethnographic work. Yet I shall argue in this essay\nthat moral judgment can be drawn from the discipline\nand that such judgments can and should be applied. I\nshall argue that, though anthropology makes a decisive\nand irreversible move away from what Bourdieu (1977\n[1972]) called doxa and so away from moral certainty,\nthis is not a move into a moral vacuum: cultural rela-\ntivism, yes, but moral relativism, no.\nThe spur for my addressing this matter was very spe-\ncific\u2014the war begun in 2003 in Iraq by the American\ngovernment. But I think a useful answer must be general,\napplying to any of those scenes of suffering which so\nmark our world, and therefore I have pursued my argu-\nment in the abstract and in principle. At the end, though,\nI do address the Iraq war specifically, as an instance to\nwhich anthropology\u2019s moral guidance may apply.\nThe path to such guidance is hardly straight or simple.\nThree threads in contemporary anthropology bear on the\nproblem, and I take up each in turn. The first thread is\nthat of cultural relativism, and I argue that this well-\nestablished and well-justified attitude does pose a seri-\nous\u2014but not a fatal\u2014obstacle to any idea that anthro-\npology as such has a moral message. The second thread\nbegins from fieldwork and the conventions that have\ncome slowly to govern both its practice and its use in\nanthropological texts. I argue that a basic moral aesthetic\nsense has grown out of our collective experience of en-\ngaging with and writing about others in very different\nmoral climes from our own. I stress that this is a moral\naesthetic because it allows for wide variations in inter-\nactive performance\u2014on the analogy of musical or artis-\ntic performance\u2014while still delivering firm judgments\nabout the quality of that performance. This moral judg-\nment arises in the interstices of the globe and in inter-\nactive sociality and so in a region that does not fall under\nany single cultural regime.\nThis interactive moral aesthetic is not peculiar to an-\nthropology. It is a more general human trait. Everyone,\nI argue, is possessed of moral agency-cum-patiency (a\nterm which recognizes that we both do and are done by)\nand a moral sense which is informed by but never de-\ntermined by the circumambient moral reasoning of oth-\ners. Furthermore\u2014and this is the third thread\u2014once we\nadmit that there is such a realm of sociality, a realm not\nfully encompassed by cultural reasonings, a more radical\nview of both culture and morality emerges. Culture, on\nthis view, is not only much more mutable than we had\nthought but in fact much more a matter of persuasion,\nof rhetoric, than of a determining software-like program.\nOn this view it would be improper to say that culture\nworks on people but proper to say that people use cul-\ntural tools to work on themselves and others. And that\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 435\nnotion will bring me full circle, to make moral comment,\nas Musil did, on the cultural persuasions of empire.\nThe First Thread: Cultural Relativism\nAs a first pass over this problem let me invoke an ex-\nperience which, I think, defines anthropological knowl-\nedge at the very beginning of one\u2019s discovery of it (I speak\nnow from years of inadvertent fieldwork among anthro-\npology students and teachers), namely, the revelation of\ncultural relativity, of a lavish, apparently endless and\nunpredictable diversity of values and practices among\ndifferent societies. This initial shock of others\u2019 diversity\nis followed closely by a second shock, a new knowledge\nof oneself: one discovers one\u2019s own world reflected in the\nalternatives, the possibilities, of others\u2019 worlds, and\nmany of one\u2019s attitudes and values are revealed to be\ncontingent and arbitrary. It becomes apparent that one\u2019s\nown arrangements are \u201cnever the only way possible,\u201d as\nMarshall Sahlins (1976) put it.\nSometimes I am privileged to see with immediacy and\nvividness the effect this ramifying, overturning knowl-\nedge may have on students, especially older students\nwho have made their way in the world and have learned\nto rely on taking a great deal for granted in, say, the\nraising of their families. For them it can be like stepping\nthrough a one-way entrance from relative simplicity and\nclarity to variety and complexity, often confusion. There\nis no return. As one woman said to me, \u201cI wake in the\nnight. I can\u2019t stop thinking, I can\u2019t stop seeing new things\n[about my life].\u201d\nAnyone who teaches anthropology may count such\nintense awareness of human social diversity and the way\nit redounds on one\u2019s own presuppositions as an achieve-\nment, even a liberation. But there is a cost, for as initiates\ncross the threshold, they go from a single moral universe,\nruled by what may seem a settled or at least an un-\nquestioned standard of the real and the good, to a uni-\nverse which is zerrissen (fragmented, ruptured, torn),2\ndisplaying many moral worlds and indeed many border-\nlands where moral worlds overlap, blend, and conflict.\nLet me tighten the tension between this anthropolo-\ngist\u2019s predicament and any particular moral certainty.\nThis liberating and troubling anthropological knowledge\nis a good deal more than just a handy archive of eth-\nnographic statements. It is that balancing and weighing\nset of mind, that explicitly cultivated sense that one will\n\u201ccompare and contrast\u201d\u2014a phrase beloved of British so-\n2. The notion of Zerrissenheit as an attribute of a torn and fatally\nflawed world was used by Hegel, but I take it from Adorno, whose\nphilosophical style of \u201cnegative dialectic\u201d was directed to showing\nhow the human world, and most specifically the post-Enlighten-\nment world of late capitalism, is sundered by the failure of people,\nideas, and institutions to achieve authenticity and wholeness or,\nas he might put it, identity with themselves. His Minima Moralia\n(2001 [1951]) demonstrates this in most elegant and penetrating\ndetail. I am more optimistic in that I take Zerrissenheit to be a\nnatural condition of human life and one to be dealt with as it arises,\nnot as a pathological condition of capitalism.\ncial anthropology examiners\u2014which brings one\u2019s own\nsociety into doubt. Such comparing is also linked to so-\ncial scientific explanation, that is, to the practice of look-\ning beyond or behind everyday knowledge for larger or\nat least other explanations, a practice which entails re-\nfusing to take people\u2019s own assumptions and explana-\ntions as final or definitive. And these habits and skills\nare heightened\u2014at least for the keen and enquiring stu-\ndent\u2014by reading a literature in which professional an-\nthropologists aim critical questions and arguments not\nonly at the passive subjects of enquiry but also at each\nother and ultimately at the very foundations of anthro-\npological knowledge itself. At this extreme of criticism\nand self-awareness even the authorities, the anthropo-\nlogical writers in whom the seeking student might have\nwished to place confidence, fall under constant, some-\ntimes corrosive scrutiny and doubt (e.g., Clifford and\nMarcus 1986, Geertz 1988).\nThis thread of systemic skepticism is only one of many\nwhich run through social and cultural anthropological\nBildung, but its demands are, once accepted, insatiable:\none may never rest, never settle on certainty, but must\nperpetually cultivate a questioning curiosity and follow\nits consequences wherever they lead. Such continual\ntesting is, no doubt, an ornament and an instrument for\na scholar and, indeed, for a scholar of any discipline, but\nthe implications can be dizzying. Nothing can be taken\nfor granted, and were there world enough and time, all\nthought and all practices could be exposed to rigorous\ninterrogation, to Musil\u2019s injunction that \u201cit could as well\nhave been otherwise.\u201d Some students even find them-\nselves following their own natural youthful skepticism\nto its logical conclusion, so that the resulting doubt can\ninfect not only their confidence in their taken-for-\ngranted world but also their confidence in anyone\u2019s\ntaken-for-granted world and anyone\u2019s authority. They\nmay reasonably find themselves asking\u2014sometimes\nwith pure puzzlement, sometimes with an edge of anx-\niety or disillusionment\u2014what the point was of this en-\ntire (and expensive!) journey through the world\u2019s and the\nanthropologists\u2019 cosmologies.\nIt is a good and perennial question, and not just for\nanthropology undergraduates. If\u2014to take a particularly\npoignant example I use in teaching\u2014even the United\nNations Universal Declaration of Human Rights amounts\nmerely to a time- and culture-bound artefact, an expres-\nsion only of some people\u2019s ideas at a particular time (North\nAtlantic liberal democracies at the end of World War II),\nthen where can we set a moral pivot? What moral ordi-\nnance can compass all that human diversity and with-\nstand the force of all those thronging possibilities?\nLet me refer to this sort of anthropologist\u2019s awareness,\nwhich I have tried here to bring to a pitch of poignancy,\nas ironic. Irony is created in the awareness that there are\ntwo or more perspectives bearing on a matter. For ex-\nample, a friend of mine refers to the present British prime\nminister as Tory Blair (he speaks in a rush, as though\nthat were simply the man\u2019s first name), a conceptual play\nwhich requires the knowledge that Tony Blair is a mem-\nber of the Labour Party but many find his policies to be\n436 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nthose of the last Tory (Conservative) government. From\na purely verbal point of view, the ironic contrast might\narise between his apparently making a mistake in pro-\nnunciation and his in fact not doing so. But I am more\ninterested in the philosophical dimension, namely, that\nsharply differing perspectives, one which regards Blair\u2019s\npolicies as wrong and one which regards them as right,\nare set together in one statement and one act of con-\nsciousness. Musil\u2019s writing sets together the perspective\nof a character, say, Count Leinsdorf, who knows himself\nto be a Realpolitiker with his feet on solid ground, and\nthe perspective of the narrator and reader, who know him\nto be swept away on the rapids of time. Similarly, an\nanthropologist\u2019s awareness might set together the aspi-\nration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nnamely, to be universal and apply to all human beings\nregardless of background or status, alongside the obser-\nvation of substantial social and cultural differences.\nThus, for example, the Universal Declaration\u2019s represen-\ntation of personhood in Articles 6 and 7\u2014\u201ceveryone has\nthe right to recognition everywhere as a person before\nthe law\u201d and \u201call are equal before the law\u201d\u2014must, for\nan anthropologist, stand against the differing forms of\npersonhood and differing attributions of personhood to\npeople of differing ages, genders, or conditions which\nactually exist and are regarded as right and proper around\nthe world (Carrithers, Collins, and Lukes 1985).\nNote how far from moral simplicity and certainty such\nanthropologist\u2019s irony may eventually reach: I choose the\nexample of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nbecause it is perhaps as close as any political statement\nof a universalizing moral project is likely to come to the\nuniversalizing scholarly project of anthropology. Here, if\nanywhere, we might wish to let ourselves down to solid\nground. Yet the logic of possibilities, of seeing every code\nlifted away from solidity in a cloud of alternatives and\nprovisos, prevents us from doing so. As Krupat (1990) has\npointed out, some growing and systematic doubt across\nall fields of the humane disciplines had crept into North\nAtlantic cultures by the end of the nineteenth century\nand was indeed already laced into the thought of Franz\nBoas. In that perspective, the all-penetrating doubt of\nMusil\u2019s fictional world is but one tentacle of a greater\nskepticism.\nOne might even seem to refine oneself by such irony\ninto a terminal loss of seriousness, leaving moral solidity\nfar behind in an ultimate postmodernist or deconstruc-\ntionist vapour state. I do think we need to bear in mind\nthe threat of ending in that state, but I hope to avoid it.\nAs James Fernandez (2001a) has pointed out, irony can\nbe a deadly serious matter. This is the more so because\nthe two perspectives united in one act of consciousness\nare very often, as both Fernandez and Paul Friedrich\n(2001) have observed, stretched across a differential of\npower. Thus my friend\u2019s reference to Tory Blair gains\nboth effect and pathos by being the comment of one\nrelatively powerless for the present to alter the flow of\nevents, and his comment is doubtless meant to bear not\nonly political but also moral force. So what I want to do\nnow is see how, given that we have crossed the threshold\ninto irony, Zerrissenheit, and cultural relativity and can\nnever return to naive moral certainty, some moral di-\nmension and therefore consolation might nevertheless\nbe found in anthropological knowledge.\nThe Second Thread: Moral Aesthetics\nTo do so, I shall follow a second thread in anthropological\nknowledge, namely, the conditions of its production. To\nMalinowski we owe the term, though not solely the prac-\ntice, of participant observation, and that term has served\nand continues to serve today as the explanation and jus-\ntification of what is distinctive in anthropological\nknowledge. But the practice of intensive, relatively long-\nterm fieldwork has also served as the medium for a\ngrowth of other discoveries and other perspectives as\nwell and some quite different understandings of field-\nwork.\nLet me begin gently with one corollary of such field-\nwork that still lies within Malinowski\u2019s sphere of inven-\ntion, namely, the notion that any particular item of\nthought or behaviour is to be explained solely by setting\nthat item\u2014perhaps something particularly exotic or re-\npugnant\u2014against the largest possible backdrop of other\nthought and custom in the society. The principle here is\nthat of holism and holistic explanation, and the connec-\ntion with extended intensive fieldwork is just this\u2014that\nonly such fieldwork can produce the wealth of knowledge\nthat would allow such explanation to succeed.\nAt first glance, holistic explanation may seem a rela-\ntively narrow matter of cognitive style in anthropology,\nbut I believe that Ernest Gellner (1977) revealed more\nthan perhaps he meant to when he wrote of such expla-\nnation as \u201cinterpretative charity.\u201d For Gellner this con-\ntrasted with what he regarded as an altogether more hard-\nheaded explanatory style, one which would not balk at\nusing robust social scientific explanation, concerning the\nplay of power or economic interest, to rip away the il-\nlusions and mystifications of local thought. On his view,\nthe anthropologist plays about the same role in explain-\ning other societies as a sociologist does in explaining our\nown, that of an authority on the actual being rather than\nthe seeming of a society. It is a role not far from that of\na social critic. Interpretative charity, however, amounts\nto a style\u2014perhaps the mainstream in American cultural\nanthropology but also an important line in British social\nanthropology\u2014which places the anthropologist rather as\nan interpreter or, as Evans-Pritchard had it, a translator.\nThis is of course a famous distinction, explanation versus\ninterpretation\/translation, but the contrasting terms also\nentail contrasting views of those targeted by the eth-\nnographer. The act of explanation lends no particular\nvalue to those explained and indeed can quite easily en-\ncompass their being deluded. The twin notions of inter-\npretation and translation, in contrast, cut in quite an-\nother direction. One interprets\u2014and it is difficult to\nthink of this practice without its original setting, the\ninterpretation of the Bible\u2014something of value; one\ntranslates a work of interest from one language to an-\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 437\nother. So whereas the explaining style sets authority\nfirmly on the shoulders of the ethnographer, the trans-\nlating style distributes authority and worth more evenly\nbetween ethnographer and those ethnographized.\nHere there seems to be at least the barest seed of a\nmoral dimension in ethnographic practice. Let me follow\nthis thread for the moment back to fieldwork itself. Some\nyears ago I had occasion to review a book by Clifford\nGeertz, Works and Lives (1988), which was likewise con-\ncerned with ethnography, though the emphasis lay on\nethnography as a practice of writing. Fieldwork had a\nrole only as the prelude to the real action, the writing,\nthe establishing by persuasive rhetorical means the self-\nvalidating, self-authorizing status of the ethnographer\nand his or her interpretation. Fieldwork amounted to\nlittle more than the gathering of corroborative detail to\nlend verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvinc-\ning narrative of \u201cbeing there,\u201d as Geertz puts it.\nThis representation of fieldwork is helpful not because\nit is faithful but rather because it is so completely at\nodds with most ethnographers\u2019 experience. First, the cog-\nnitive ethos of fieldwork requires a thorough commit-\nment to the quintessentially unpredictable experience\nitself, such that whatever arises should be the fruit of\nthat long laborious exposure and opening to those others\u2019\nrationalities and arrangements. Even the carefully pol-\nished hypotheses which earned one a research grant may\nbe cheerfully sacrificed, since all explanation or inter-\npretation must be grounded in the fieldwork process it-\nself, creating what sociological colleagues have usefully\ntermed \u201cgrounded theory.\u201d\nSecond, this exposure in fieldwork entails not only a\ncognitive but also an existential commitment which, for\nmany of us, takes us far beyond any comforting famil-\niarity or well-practised ease of our known social world.\nWe conceive, and many of us have experienced, field-\nwork as being constituted as much by its labours and its\nrigours, its embarrassments and adjustments, as by its\ndiscoveries, so that one\u2019s commitment to the new is\nwritten not only in fieldnotes but also in\u2014well, for some\nof us, anyway\u2014our blood, or at least our blushes. Taken\nfrom this viewpoint, it is the openness to others and the\nestablishment of fruitful and enlightening relationships\nthat not only make fieldwork possible but also constitute\nmuch of both its pith and its pain. Indeed, the pain may\nbecome knowledge, a point famously exemplified in the\nwork of Jean Briggs (1970), whose momentary burst of\nanger before her Inuit hosts led to her being ostracized\namid the harshest circumstances but also gave her in-\ncisive knowledge of Inuit sensibilities.\nWhat I want to suggest so far is this: both the intel-\nlectual practice of ethnographic interpretation and the\nembodied practice of fieldwork carry with them neces-\nsarily the first sketch of a moral position, namely, the\nrecognition of the worth of others. I also want to suggest\nthat this recognition of others is necessarily entwined\nwith the understanding of others that lies at the heart\nof the ethnographic project. This moral dimension in\nanthropology did not really begin to be recognized until\nthe 1960s, beginning with the publication of Casa-\ngrande\u2019s In the Company of Man, a collection of articles\nin which noted ethnographers wrote quite personally of\ntheir chief informants\/consultants. Later in that decade\nKenneth Read (1966) wrote very personally of his own\nexperiences of fieldwork in Papua New Guinea, and in\nthat same year Hortense Powdermaker wrote a memoir\nin which she designated the anthropologist as a \u201chuman\ninstrument\u201d studying other human beings (1966:19).\nJean Briggs\u2019s Never in Anger appeared in 1970.\nIn this continuing and still widening stream of an-\nthropological practice, writers have not only turned to a\nless impersonal, disembodied, and magisterial style but\nin so doing stressed the moral import of ethnography and\nthus transformed our understanding of anthropological\nknowledge itself. The acceptance of named individuals,\nwhether anthropologist or informant\/consultant or both,\ninto written, so to speak official, discourse has allowed\na side of anthropological knowledge to emerge which\nwas otherwise hidden. It has revealed the extent to which\nthe production of the knowledge depends upon the cre-\nation of relationships\u2014which must always be shorthand\nfor morally charged relationships\u2014between anthropol-\nogists and their informants\/consultants. This is far from\na merely practical or technical matter, for the anthro-\npologist\u2019s eventual product therefore depends as much\non what is learned about local moral standards through\nthese relationships as on what is gathered through sys-\ntematic enquiry. One learns the language, to be sure, but\none also learns the pragmatics of the language\u2014its\nproper use in working with people. One learns suitable\nbehaviour, and in so doing one learns too what is appro-\npriate to this person or that and thus to differentiate\nbetween what is generically appropriate to various types\nof person and what is allowable with this or that specific\nperson. And across many genres of activity and social\noccasion one learns\u2014probably with more a passive than\nan active competence\u2014to evaluate and appreciate per-\nformances and even sometimes the nuances of perfor-\nmances. I have elsewhere called this \u201cengaged learn-\ning\u201d\u2014a phrase which I explicitly oppose to \u201cparticipant\nobservation\u201d\u2014and by adding the \u201cengaged\u201d to \u201clearn-\ning\u201d I have meant to stress the existential and moral\ndimension of the labour, the extent to which one\u2019s whole\nperson is exposed and subjected to the judgments and\ncorrections of others in the process (Carrithers 1992). It\nis more like learning right from wrong than like learning\na set of facts.\nThis generalizing image of ethnographic work does not\neasily lead to a generalizing morality, but I think we can\ngo beyond just a recognition of others\u2019 moral worth. The\ndistinction between learning what is proper to various\ntypes of person and what is allowable with some specific\nperson surely constitutes an expertise which would pro-\nduce faithful ethnographic description, but it also cor-\nresponds to a distinction drawn many years ago by the\nsocial phenomenologist Alfred Schu\u00a8tz between Neben-\nmenschen (which he translated as \u201ccontemporaries\u201d) and\nMitmenschen (which he translated as \u201cconsociates\u201d).\nNebenmenschen are those whom we know only as types,\nthat is, distantly, formally, and solely by their roles,\n438 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nwhereas Mitmenschen are those we know as specific and\nidiosyncratic individuals. He characterized the relation-\nship with Mitmenschen thus (Schu\u00a8tz 1962:24): \u201cEach\npartner participates in the onrolling life of the other, can\ngrasp in a vivid present the other\u2019s thoughts as they are\nbuilt up step by step. They may thus share one another\u2019s\nanticipations of the future as plans, or hopes, or anxie-\nties. . . . They are mutually involved in one another\u2019s\nbiography; they are growing older together.\u201d\nThe realities of fieldwork vary immensely, all the more\nso since fieldwork \u201cat home\u201d has now become routine.\nSome, such as the ethnomusicologist David MacAllester,\nhave enjoyed lifetime relationships with their inform-\nants\/consultants and have indeed been involved in their\nbiographies and grown old with them. A more usual\u2014\nmay I say, typical\u2014series of relationships is that de-\nscribed so well by Paul Rabinow (1977), which certainly\nwent as far as mutual involvement in one another\u2019s bi-\nography for a while but which, given the physical and\nsocial distance between the U.S.A. and Morocco, would\nnot necessarily lead to growing older together. This eth-\nnographic variant of mitmenschlich sociality may be\nlimited not just by time and local circumstance but also\nby a more generally compromised character, the fact that\nanthropologists have usually practised what Powder-\nmaker called \u201cdownward\u201d anthropology, working from\na relatively privileged socioeconomic position in the\nworld system on those in a relatively less privileged po-\nsition. Many writers have marked this moral unease for\nus, and I note that it is an unease which is often dis-\ncovered spontaneously by students of anthropology.\nNevertheless, this global unease does not efface the\nmitmenschlich morality that arises with informants\/\nconsultants\u2014and now I must add, friends\u2014during field-\nwork. The key to the morality of this relationship is\ncaptured, I think, in Schu\u00a8tz\u2019s statement that \u201ceach part-\nner participates in the onrolling life of the other.\u201d This\nmutual participation must be built on a sense of the\nother\u2019s worth and on trust, that is, mutual predictability\nand the presumption of mutual aid. And it also requires\nsympathetic forbearance, the ability to enter into an-\nother person\u2019s situation imaginatively without neces-\nsarily sharing the other\u2019s values or cosmology. Rabinow\nshows this clearly, and I can say that I got along very\nwell with a Jain friend in Kolhapur in India who ex-\nplained to me and illustrated with diagrams that the\nworld was basically flat and centred upon the gargantuan\nMount Meru somewhere beyond the Himalayas.\nIt is true that there was some tinge of local cultures,\ntheirs and mine, in many of my relationships in Kol-\nhapur. Older men presumed that, since I was younger, I\nwas to be instructed de haut en bas, Indian-style. There\nwas also some happy coincidence of cultural presuppo-\nsitions in that many found in Jainism a universalizing\nrecognition of other human beings that I could find in\nmy own background. But the actual achievement of such\nrelationships required mutual sympathetic forbearance\nwhich ran beyond such accidents of culture. This was\nevidenced for me by a conversation I had in different\nforms with different men concerning our respective sit-\nuations: they thought themselves independent, since\nthey ran their own businesses and were not, as I was,\nsubservient to an institution and to the will of others; I\nthought myself independent because I could pursue my\nresearch interests and not be bound to the drudgery and\nanxiety of Indian commerce. We never agreed, but we\ndid understand for immediate purposes. We also man-\naged, though with more strain and evasion on my part,\nto agree to differ about Western eating habits versus their\nvegetarianism, which for them touches very closely the\nself-evident practices of Jain living. But in either case it\nis the very conversation itself, with its mutual under-\nstanding and its differing views, that illustrates my\npoint. Here is an ad hoc morality of mutual recognition,\nmutual trust, and mutual forbearance which arises more\nor less spontaneously in the course of interaction, in\nsome part because of and in greater part despite our cul-\ntural differences.\nA little more light can be shed on such relationships\nif we think of them, as I have elsewhere suggested (1992),\nas created by the exercise of social aesthetic standards.\nThe phrase is meant to capture both the moral character\nof human relations\u2014that there are expectations applied\nand judgments made\u2014and the flexibility of a feel for\nrelationships which fits one to meet the unexpected and\nunpredictable exigencies of everyday life. The analogy is\nwith music such as jazz, which must at once fall rec-\nognizably into the genre and leave room for an aesthet-\nically appropriate variation and innovation. My col-\nleague Sal Buckler has suggested to me that this analogy\ncan be taken to encompass encounters by people of dif-\nferent social traditions as well. Thus we are now used\nto hearing music made by players from widely different\ntraditions, a hybrid often called \u201cfusion\u201d music. Such\nmusic is founded in expert facility with the common\nmatters of pitch, rhythm, melody, and polyphony, a fa-\ncility which of course fits musicians to play in their own\ntradition but which is the ground for a graceful adapta-\ntion to hybrid situations as well. So, by analogy, the flex-\nible social skills acquired in growing up\u2014recognizing\nothers\u2019 personhood, establishing trust, and practicing for-\nbearance\u2014fit one for improvising in social encounters\nwith a wide variety of others, including complete\nstrangers.\nLet me summarize the argument so far: First, a moral\naesthetic is already and inevitably built into the condi-\ntions of anthropological research simply because that re-\nsearch is constituted in the creation and understanding\nof social relations. Second, this aesthetic standard has\ncome increasingly to the surface in anthropological writ-\nings and the archive of anthropological knowledge.\nAlongside the admission of personal and interpersonal\nillustration to ethnographic writing, anthropologists\nhave also developed explicit professional ethics, the\ncodes of the American Anthropological Association and\nthe Association of Social Anthropologists of Great Brit-\nain and the Commonwealth. Moreover, a general shift\nin the conditions of anthropological work has meant that\nthose ethnographized are now much more likely to be\nreaders, as well as subjects, of anthropological research.\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 439\nThis is so both because of the spread of literacy and\naccompanying skills among those traditionally studied\nby ethnographers and because ethnography is increas-\ningly practised \u201cat home.\u201d The general awareness of an-\nthropologists\u2019 relative privilege compared with the re-\nstricted life chances of those studied also plays a great\npart, suggesting that we treat our subjects gently and if\npossible support them against the global distribution of\npower. Anthropologists now tend to be more restrained\nin their production of knowledge by the sensibility that\nwhat is said about people cannot differ too much from\nwhat is said to people.\nHow does this morally infused character of anthro-\npological knowledge stand alongside that other trait, its\nzerrissen, fragmented, relative rather than absolute, and\nironic character, its existence in a cloud of possibilities?\nI think the beginning of the answer lies in the mutual\nforbearance I described above. In the immediacy of field-\nwork, such forbearance allows the interlocutors\u2014say, a\nJain trader and myself\u2014to become aware of differences\nin opinion and orientation over a single matter\u2014say, eat-\ning habits\u2014and so to create at least the rudiments of an\nironic awareness of difference in perspective. I suppose\nthat this potential irony was quashed in the minds of\nsome Jain interlocutors straightaway by a judgment from\nmoral certainty to the effect that my open-mindedness\u2014\nor my equivocations, qualifications, and evasions\u2014\nabout diet were simply wrong. End of irony, end of Zer-\nrissenheit. Other Jains, perhaps mostly those aware of\nthe forbearance and compromise useful to life in a cos-\nmopolitan society such as India\u2019s, did not find the matter\nso simple, and certainly I did not. For one thing, in an\nearlier episode in my life I had been an intolerantly doc-\ntrinaire vegetarian who had gone to do fieldwork briefly\nin Navajo country. On my first afternoon there I was\ninvited to eat in the brush shade built for those visiting\none of the very ceremonies I had gone to study. What\nluck!, I thought. Then they graciously offered me fried\nmutton, boiled mutton, mutton stew, or grilled mutton.\nEnd of vegetarianism, end of certainty, beginning of Zer-\nrissenheit. I now live in a cloud of possibilities concern-\ning diet, a cloud which has only been amplified in en-\ncounters with Buddhists in Sri Lanka, Jains in India, and\nhealthy dietary advice in contemporary Britain.\nFor the most part, the existence of such a cloud of\npossibilities can only be inferred from ethnographic writ-\ning. Ethnographers have cultivated a style in which we\nwrite firmly and dispassionately, creating texts which\noffer positive knowledge in a professionally evenhanded\nand, so far as is possible, non-committal tone. However\nnuanced and ironic our understanding of, say, dietary\npossibilities, we learn to thread a narrow, partly asser-\ntive, partly reticent course of interpretation through\nthose possibilities. The gap between the never-quite-said\ncomplexities of ironic awareness and the apparently con-\nfident polish of ethnographic writing was brought home\nto me by Mark Holmstro\u00a8m at a workshop of anthropol-\nogists writing about Indian religions. He suddenly re-\nmarked in medias res to those assembled that we talked\nas though none of us had considered the possibility that\nthe Indian ideas we were discussing might be true. This\nobservation sank below the surface of conversation and\nof convention almost as soon as it was made, but it led\nsome of us later to reflect that there were many more\nattitudes to Indic religion than there were people present\nin that room. Any one of us was capable of entertaining\nor at least simulating many attitudes, and among us we\nrepresented a wide palette of opinion from admiration\nand acceptance through uncertainty to deep rationalist\nskepticism or distaste. What emerged into print and into\nthe archive was deeply informed by this cloud of pos-\nsibilities but trimmed into acceptable form by a deli-\ncately modulated sense of the ethnographic setting, the\npeople studied, one\u2019s colleagues, and the present aes-\nthetics of ethnographic writing.\nPrelude to the Third Thread:\nCosmo-sociological Thought\nIn the picture of anthropological knowledge and its mo-\nrality that I have so far sketched, I have taken our re-\nceived synopsis of the world\u2019s societies and cultures and\nthe consequent doctrine of cultural relativism for\ngranted. This has been the ground against which the\nwork of ethnography is the figure. I now put our view\nof cultural relativism to the question. What if both figure\nand ground were subjected to another and, I think, more\nextreme perspective, that of a radical historicity, radical\nhistorical relativity? Musil wrote: \u201cThe train of time is\na train that rolls out its tracks in front of itself. The river\nof time is a river that carries its own banks along with\nit. The traveler moves between firm walls, on firm\nground; but, imperceptibly, ground and walls are moved\nvigorously by the traveler.\u201d This takes us, I hope, to a\nmore synoptic view, one which embraces not only the\nconditions of anthropological knowledge but also their\nroots in a more generous conception of common social\nlife.\nLet me begin with an instructive ethnographic ex-\nample, one taken from the German social and cultural\nhistorian and social commentator Jan Philip Reemtsma.\nIn a subtle and important article he addresses a question\nsimilar to the one I began with: How, he asks, does the\nWestern Enlightenment program of moral universal-\nism\u2014one moral code that applies to all human beings\nregardless of culture or social origin\u2014fare in the face of\nits cultural and historical limitations, including its re-\nstriction to the Western world as well as its manifest\nfailures in cold historical fact? Although his answer is\ncomplex, it moves toward the doubled conclusion that\neven in the darkest circumstances some morality akin\nto universalism can arise, but such a morality is nev-\nertheless tied to particular places and people. The Danes\u2019\nwidespread refusal to give Jews away to the Nazis, for\nexample, or the refusal by individual doctors to take part\nin the Nazis\u2019 euthanasia program directed to those men-\ntally disabled might seem to show people treating others\n\u201cin a spirit of brotherhood,\u201d to quote the Universal Dec-\n440 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nlaration of Human Rights. But, he argues, people were\nin fact not so much adhering to a universalistic standard\nas \u201cpursuing the universalistic project as [their] partic-\nular morality\u201d (2001:100).\nI would go a step farther and specify that it was rather\na moral aesthetics at work here. To show what I mean,\nI quote two individual cases given by Reemtsma. The\nfirst is that of a German psychiatrist who refused to par-\nticipate in a sterilization program for the mentally hand-\nicapped. When her superior tried to persuade her by say-\ning, \u201cDon\u2019t you see that they aren\u2019t like you?\u201d she\nreplied, \u201cThere are many people who aren\u2019t like me, in\nthe first place, you\u201d (quoted in Reemtsma 2001:100). The\nsecond example concerns a woman who proposed to\nshelter a Jewish girl, thus endangering her whole family.\nThe woman argued successfully for the plan to her hus-\nband by reminding him of the story of the Good Samar-\nitan, but rather than suggesting that they emulate the\nGood Samaritan she said, \u201cDo you really want to act like\nthe first two travellers, who just looked away and passed\non?\u201d (quoted in Reemtsma 2001:99).\nWhat can be inferred most directly from these two\nexamples? If we begin with the psychiatrist, we can see\nthat her speech itself refers to the immediate face-to-face\nsituation, a more or less instantaneous and deeply felt\nresponse to another person. It is a response that, like the\nsecond woman\u2019s, does not make an appeal to a common\nhumanity which would bind psychiatrist and patient,\nwoman and Jewish child, even though that is what one\nwould expect from the humanist morality. Instead, each\nwoman\u2019s is a sharp and immediate rejection, an ad hoc\ndelimitation between the speaker and others, quite im-\nmediately in the case of the psychiatrist and by impli-\ncation in the case of the other woman, who was sur-\nrounded by people conforming to Nazi demands. So, to\nexploit the idea of a moral aesthetic, we can say that\nhere the women applied such an aesthetic\u2014Reemtsma\nwrites of a \u201cfeeling\u201d or \u201cawareness\u201d\u2014to an immediate\nand unprecedented situation. More to the point, these\nwomen improvised, and they improvised on what was\navailable to them in the situation rather than in the light\nof hindsight, of a larger or more comprehensive retro-\nspective knowledge gathered at leisure. Earlier I em-\nployed the analogy of improvisation in music, but in\nthese cases we can see that a better analogy would be\nthat of improvising a response in the middle of an earth-\nquake or a fire, acting on incomplete knowledge under\npressure and looking forward perhaps to life or death and,\nin this case, most certainly to the life or death of one\u2019s\nself-esteem.\nThese cases bring to the fore two matters. The first is\nmoral agency, which here resembles what Durkheim and\nMauss might have called a \u201ccategory\u201d of human expe-\nrience, a basic term by which social life is made possible\nand in the light of which it is conducted. Mauss tried to\nshow that the category of the \u201cperson,\u201d which is the\nclosest their thought came to touching moral agency, is\nalways and ultimately subjected to the coercive force of\nthe collective and of collective representations (see Car-\nrithers, Collins, and Lukes 1985). On that view, appar-\nently individual judgments and acts are always finally\nexplained by the force of culture and social structure,\nand indeed this form of explanation has, in many guises,\nbecome routine in anthropology: social sanctions and\nenculturation are but two ideas that follow in this style.\nReemtsma adopts a similar stance when he argues that\nthe two women are acting according to a particular mo-\nrality, which he understands as a particular culture.\nHowever, the difference between a Maussian idea of\nthe person and moral agency is revealed by Reemtsma\nhimself. He quotes from Lessings\u2019s Nathan der Weise,\nin which Saladin addresses Nathan the Wise in these\nterms: \u201cA man like you doesn\u2019t stay where the accident\nof birth has thrown him; or if he stays, he stays through\ninsight, for good reason and choice of the better.\u201d The\nMaussian idea of the person has room only for \u201cthe ac-\ncident of birth,\u201d that is, having been born into a partic-\nular society and culture and acting wholly under the\ninfluence of that culture, with insight, reason, and choice\nplaying no part. The notion of moral agency, in contrast,\nallows that people exercise insight (or foolishness) and\ngood (or bad) reason. It entails an awareness of people as\nboth acting and reacting, as both agents and patients (in\nGodfrey Lienhardt\u2019s [1961] terms) in their social world.\nAnd because it allows both agency and patiency we can\ngain a picture of society as a web of persons both acting\nupon each other and acted upon and therefore in a state\nof flux and, to a degree, uncertainty. The Maussian no-\ntion, to the contrary, allows for personhood only as pa-\ntiency, as acting solely according to the dictates of col-\nlective representations, and therefore denies uncertainty\nor choice.\nOne implication of moral agency-cum-patiency\u2014one\nof primary importance for anthropology and for my ar-\ngument\u2014is that it allows for mutability in human so-\nciety and therefore for historical change. This is not, I\nmust stress, a \u201cgreat-individual\u201d theory of change but\nrather a theory which attempts to reflect the ceaseless\naction and reaction of people upon each other and so to\nmatch more closely our actual experience of the world.\nHence\u2014and this is another implication of moral\nagency\u2014if we sought to explain both these women\u2019s re-\njection of Nazi ideas and practices and others\u2019 acceptance\nof them, we would have to look to moral agency as part\nof that explanation. I do not presume to offer that ex-\nplanation here, but I do note that there was not just one\nculture-cum-morality then present in Germany, that of\nhumanistic universalism, or just two, that of humanism\nand that of Nazism, but many others, including the then\nsuppressed culture of socialism and the then threatened\nmoral codes and practices of Christianity. The Nazis\u2019\ninstruments of propaganda and terror were aimed at\n\u201cnormalizing\u201d (gleichschalten) this variety, settling the\nprimacy of their own ideology and forcing people into\nline, but these instruments themselves still required at\nbase that people be moral agents-cum-patients, capable\nof being influenced or coerced, of acting correctly or in-\ncorrectly in the Nazis\u2019 eyes.\nHere we have reached the ground, I think, of any ex-\nplanation: the notions of agency and patiency, insight\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 441\nand choice are necessary ingredients of any explanatory\nscheme. One implication of this argument is that we can\nexpect to find moral agency among those whom we\nmight otherwise dismiss, in the absence of closer evi-\ndence, as merely brainwashed or merely unthinking cul-\ntural automata, including those who refused to harbour\nJewish children or who embraced the euthanasia pro-\ngram. And the general lesson would be that, even where\nevents appear to follow a culturally ordained course, un-\ntroubled by accident, we must still understand moral\nagency to be working alongside the persuasions of cul-\nture and social position.\nThe second matter brought out in the women\u2019s cases\nis what might be called the arrow of time. By this I mean\nthe unremitting tempo of events, the inescapable fact\nthat there is no \u201ctime out,\u201d as Harold Garfinkel said, no\nrecess in proceedings in which to think things over, to\ndevise a reasoned response, or to consult moral author-\nities. Events march on, situations unravel, emergencies\nintervene. The women were living forward, dealing with\nuncertainties in prospect rather than with finished sto-\nries in retrospect, for, as Kierkegaard remarked, life is\nlived forward but understood backward.\nIt is difficult to follow fully the implications of Kier-\nkegaard\u2019s insight, since we are, as a species, so very good\nat retrospection, at post hoc justification, and in general\nat understanding what has happened rather than what is\nnow happening. In the very short term, this post hoc\ncharacter of human interaction has been demonstrated\nrepeatedly by conversational analysts, who have shown\nhow \u201cconversational repair,\u201d retrospective adjustment to\nwhat might be regarded as continual mistakes in talk,\nenables conversation to proceed as if mutually planned\nand mutually understandable. On a medium scale, it is\na continuous and perhaps insurmountable challenge to\nhistorical scholarship to understand actions as they were\nunderstood at the time rather than in the light of the\nway the story ended. And on a very large scale, consider\none of the tragic ironies of the twentieth century: that\nthe political, formal, and international recognition of the\nEnlightenment humanist project through its codification\nin such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Hu-\nman Rights, the Helsinki Accords, and the European Hu-\nman Rights Act could only occur in response to the Nazi\nand the Stalinist terror. The narrative sources which un-\nderpin these instruments of humanist morality are tales\nof genocide, extrajudicial violence, and aggressive war-\nfare drawn from those dark decades, the 1930s and 1940s.\nAs many have remarked, if there is a single morality tale\non which at least North Atlantic societies can now agree,\nit is the story of the repression, expropriation, and hu-\nmiliation of the Jews, ending in their murder. This pow-\nerful narrative material supports a retrospective, uni-\nversally applied moralizing, a moralizing which was not\nat all uniformly shared in those disastrous decades but\nhas now gained indisputable authority as the ultimate\nand certain gauge of good and evil.\nLet me summarize this character of human life as his-\ntoricity, which includes both moral agency-cum-pa-\ntiency\u2014the mutable web of human interconnected-\nness\u2014and time\u2019s inexorable arrow or, as J. D. Y. Peel\n(1987) put it, \u201cchange, incompleteness and potentiality,\nmemories and intentions.\u201d The fact of social and cultural\nchange has niggled at the periphery from the very be-\nginning of anthropology, but the creation and exploita-\ntion of ahistorical ideas dominated theory until late in\nthe twentieth century. Durkheimian functionalism and\nlater Parsonian structural-functionalism made it easy to\nunderstand a society as something that works in a com-\nplex way but not as something that changes.\nIndeed, anthropology was in quite an extraordinary\nplight, for it promulgated a view of human life as com-\nprising a vast diversity of cultures and society\u2014our first\nthread\u2014but was quite unable to offer any account of how\nthat diversity had come about, whether in principle or\nin fact. Only in the 1980s did the problem of historicity\nenter the mainstream of anthropological thought. Wolf\n(1982) displayed a human world comprising not auton-\nomous societies-cum-cultures but intertwining and con-\nstantly changing systems created by continuous inter-\naction. Hobsbawm and Ranger (1983) modelled for\nanthropologists the ways in which people constantly\nspin the false impression of age-old traditions, a sort of\npervasive human industry of instant culture, and I (1983)\nshowed how widely varied cultural forms can be re-\nworked out of a common religious tradition. Rosaldo\n(1989) argued that actual borderlands, such as those along\nthe U.S.-Mexican boundary, should now be studied as\nsites of hybridity and of cultural creativity and, more\nimportant, that metaphorical borderlines\u2014borderlines\nof, say, gender, class, or ethnicity\u2014run throughout our\nsupposedly monolithic societies and cultures and these\ntoo are loci of continuous social and cultural invention\nand change.\nIn 1992 I argued that this radically historicized view\nof culture makes for quite a different view not only of\nhuman beings\u2019 existential situation but also of the re-\nsources they bring to that situation. Among the human\nattributes I identified were moral aesthetic standards,\nwhich allow for flexibility and, I would now say, for the\napplication of judgment and insight by human agents. I\nwrote of creativity as a constant, if unremarked, char-\nacteristic of everyday life and of the sensitive web of\ninterrelatedness in which we incessantly act and react\ntoward one another, leading to results which are seldom\nforeseen in any one person\u2019s plan or vision. And I pro-\nposed that we understand flexible narrative thought and\nthe ability to recount convincing stories for others as\nfundamental to our ability to deal with the complexities\nof social life and the emergencies of historicity. These\ngeneral conditions support a finer, more discriminating,\nand certainly more challenging view of human social\nreality, one which matches Musil\u2019s imagery: \u201cThe trav-\neler moves between firm walls, on firm ground; but, im-\nperceptibly, ground and walls are moved vigorously by\nthe traveler.\u201d This is a view which does not replace our\nfundamental doctrine of cultural relativity but renders\nit more radical in seeing constant processes of cultural\ncreation, destruction, hybridization, and diversification\nat work. To return to Musil again, the possibilities raised\n442 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nby the older version of cultural relativity are now mul-\ntiplied by the possibilities\u2014in Peel\u2019s words, \u201cincom-\npleteness and potentiality, memories and intentions\u201d\u2014\nraised by a vision of people in the flow of events, peering\nforward anxiously to the consequences of acts, looking\nback to interpret the meaning of acts already committed,\nand seeking always to find a convincing account of\nevents to guide them.\nThe Third Thread: Persuasion\nThis is an image less comforting, displaying a condition\na good deal more precarious, than previous generations\nof anthropologists had devised. One persistent earlier im-\nage was that of culture as a house which people move\ninto at birth and leave at death but which itself tran-\nscends mortality and endures. Here the imagery is not\nquite so easy. Perhaps we could think of castaways on a\ndesert island left to rely on and to repair for their use a\nmiscellany of rusting tools and ramshackle buildings,\nthat is, culture and social structure. It would be even\nbetter, though, to leave elaborate imagery aside and adopt\na vocabulary which I owe to James Fernandez (1986) and\nother colleagues in the rhetoric theory school. The first\nterm is the inchoate, that is, the unformed, the unca-\ntegorized, the so-far chaotic. Fernandez uses the idea of\nthe inchoate to capture the general human plight of con-\ntinually threatening uncertainty, obscurity, and danger,\nthe as-yet-not-grasped, \u201cthe dark at the top of the stairs,\u201d\nas he puts it. People respond by applying native wit and\ncontrivances of culture plucked from a common store to\nmake a movement away from the inchoate, which I un-\nderstand to mean a move toward sense and policy, toward\nan interpretation of the situation and toward a plan. This\nmovement of mind then leads to performance, to action\nor reaction. This is, so to speak, a skeletal psychology\nfor anthropologists\u2019 use, but it is not an individual psy-\nchology, for that \u201cmaking a movement\u201d is as much in-\nterpersonal and social as it is individual. The key idea\nhere is that of persuasion: by using the conceptual re-\nsources available, people press interpretations and poli-\ncies on others as well as themselves (for self-persuasion,\nsee Neinkamp 2001). Persuasion also leads directly to\nthe useful idea that conceptual resources provided in cul-\nture are used by people in the play of agents and patients\nin social life, so that the shorthand idea that culture itself\nis like an agent, making people act as they do, can have\nno purchase.\nI think that the idea of culture as a resource is far-\nreaching in its implications but does not comprehend\neverything that we might think of as culture, that is,\n\u201clearned as a member of society,\u201d to adapt Tylor\u2019s orig-\ninal definition. Let me speak of the rhetorical edge of\nculture. On one hand, some of what is learned is not\nrhetorical in that it is in effect largely corporeal, such as\ntechniques of production. So one can learn and practice,\nfor example, the use of the mattock in preparing a field\nfor paddy cultivation. That item of culture can, however,\nbe used persuasively: I once heard a Buddhist monk ex-\nplain in a sermon to novice monks in Sri Lanka that one\nshould cultivate virtue and proper monastic behaviour\nas a preparation for wisdom just as one would use a mat-\ntock to prepare a field for cultivation. The cooking of\nthe flatbread chapati in India is a distinct and, in my\nexperience, difficult and purely corporeal skill, but it be-\ncame persuasive when it was used by a Jain ascetic in a\nsermon to explain that the soul can be separated from\nits impurities as the top side of a properly made chapati\nrises away from the bottom as it is heated on the griddle.\nWriters such as Fernandez have discovered for us that\na great deal of human thought and persuasion works\nthrough metaphors such as these. Metaphor is the use\nof ideas and images from a sphere of experience which\nis more or less understood and taken for granted to grasp\nand organize for the mind\u2019s eye another, more problem-\natic sphere. So the skillful Jain preacher uses the every-\nday sphere of cooking to seize and clarify the more neb-\nulous Jain metaphysics of the soul. Similarly, Naomi\nQuinn (1987) has shown how American speakers gen-\nerally reach for imagery about a constructed artefact to\nexplain the more elusive complexities of contemporary\nmarried life: \u201cOur marriage is put together pretty good,\u201d\n\u201cWe built it up slowly,\u201d \u201cWe had to tinker with it,\u201d\n\u201cThen it started to come apart,\u201d etc. The general obser-\nvation that Americans use such imagery is a discovery\nof the anthropologist and can be noted down as an item\nof American culture; the source of the imagery lies in\nthe experience of our technological civilization and its\nabundance of constructed devices, but the particular ex-\npression and particular application of such imagery to\nparticular cases displays an otherwise unremarked cre-\nativity, the poetics of everyday life.\nThis rhetorical edge in culture is by no means confined\nto metaphor or even to that and other devices of rhetor-\nical thought which anthropologists have discussed, such\nas metonymy and synecdoche. It is rather a more general\nhuman trait, an ability to slip in thought from one matter\nto another and to set those matters together in an illu-\nminating or persuasive way\u2014making, if you will, a new\nartefact out of old materials. Consider the synthesized\nand persuasive performance of the Pledge of Allegiance,\nwhich I had to recite every day of my school life, standing\nwith my fellow pupils with our right hands on our hearts\nand addressing our attention to the American flag set\nover the blackboard:\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of\nAmerica and to the republic for which it stands, one\nnation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and jus-\ntice for all.\nI have set this out to emphasize only one of the many\nfeatures of this rich utterance, namely, the linking of the\nconcrete substantives. There are four in italics, but the\nutterance begins with a fifth symbol, the highly pat-\nterned flag on the wall. That is drawn into focal attention\nby the first verbal substantive, \u201cflag,\u201d and allegiance is\nthereby pledged to that already symbolic object. This is\na notable slippage and synthesis by the persuasive cul-\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 443\ntural imagination, not least because allegiance would not\nordinarily apply to anything other than persons. Then\nthe representative purpose of the flag is stated: the flag\n\u201cstands for\u201d the republic, a term which implies both a\nform of government and a particular political state. This\npolitical state is then identified as a \u201cnation,\u201d suggesting\nwhat Benedict Anderson called \u201ca deep horizontal com-\nradeship,\u201d and then the \u201call\u201d gathers up the nation as-\nsertively into an exhaustively comprehensive collective.\nSome of these connections may be so old and widespread\nas to seem self-evident, such as the connection between\nthe \u201call,\u201d the \u201cnation,\u201d and the state, even though sober\nreflection may reveal that the political state is not the\nsame as the nation of people and that the nation may\nnot in practice include \u201call\u201d in equal liberty and justice.\nOther connections, such as the act of pledging allegiance\nto that vivid symbol on the wall, are perhaps more\nplainly the work of the persuasive imagination.\nAs the presence of the flag and the pupils\u2019 posture\nindicate, this play of persuasion is not merely mental\nand verbal but practical. My grandfather, an army officer\ntrained at the United States Military Academy at West\nPoint, taught me as a child how I was help him metic-\nulously to fold, unfold, raise, and lower the flag at his\nhouse daily, a protocol which included the strict injunc-\ntion never to let it touch the ground. Forty years later\nthe flag used at the burial of my father, a veteran of World\nWar II, was solemnly and ceremoniously handed to me,\nfolded in just that same way.\nTo see the flag and the Pledge of Allegiance as an an-\nthropologist is to see it as a work of historicity, of his-\ntorical construction; I witnessed a small part of that con-\nstruction myself when President Dwight Eisenhower\nadded the phrase \u201cunder God\u201d to the pledge when I was\na child. And to see the flag and the Pledge of Allegiance\nin this light is to be aware of a cloud of other possibilities\nand so potentially to see them with the eyes of a skeptic:\nI have, after all, stepped through that one-way door into\nirony and Zerrissenheit. Yet there is a further irony here,\nsince the second understanding does not erase the first,\nthe knot of feelings around the flag created by those\nwords, enactments, and experiences and embodied for\nme in the persons of my grandfather and father. In\nGeertz\u2019s (1973 [1966]) words, this social and symbolic\nwork on me in childhood established \u201cpowerful, perva-\nsive and long-lasting moods and motivations\u201d and\nclothed those feelings \u201cwith such an aura of factuality\nthat the moods and motivations seem uniquely realis-\ntic.\u201d The sense of a \u201cunique reality\u201d has been lost for\nme, but \u201cthe powerful moods\u201d can still respond to acts\ndone, for good or ill, under the aegis of that flag: I write\nin 2003, hardly six months since the American invasion\nof Iraq.\nStories as Persuasion\nI want finally to adduce another feature of persuasion,\nand that is the use of story. I have argued at length else-\nwhere (1992) that our capacity to participate in our\nuniquely human form of complex social life is founded\nin the ability to find and follow a thread of narrative\nthrough a skein of events. This capacity has a passive\nside, being able to interpret human cause and human\neffect, but also an active one, being able to use story-\ntelling to convince others of our interpretation. On this\nview a story includes (1) characters, with their feelings,\nmemories, intentions, and attitudes, (2) their actions, (3)\nthe effects of those actions on others\u2019 feelings, memories,\nintentions, and attitudes, and (4) so on, as those others\nmay respond to the actions of the first, making up an\nunfolding plot. Stories, in other words, are synthetic,\nlinking characters to their thoughts, to their actions, to\nthe consequences of those actions, to the further char-\nacters and reactions of those affected, and onward in po-\ntentially limitless chains.\nMany years ago Malinowski noted that story can work\nas a \u201ccharter\u201d for action, and since then anthropologists\nhave used stories of many kinds, from myth to case\nstudy, in many ways to create ethnographic accounts.\nIndeed, I would say that we have necessarily used stories,\nsince human interaction cannot be woven into an in-\ntelligible form otherwise. It is through stories that we\ncome to understand \u201cthe moral significance of situa-\ntions,\u201d as Evans-Pritchard put it (1969:53). This touches\nagain the skeletal psychology I set out above, for the\nmoral significance of situations is not necessarily im-\nmediately given and intelligible. Situations are initially\ninchoate and require a movement of mind\u2014in this case,\na narrative movement\u2014to create significance. Fernandez\nuses the felicitous idea of an \u201cinchoate pronoun,\u201d that\nis, an as yet barely defined \u201cI,\u201d or \u201cyou,\u201d or \u201cwe,\u201d or\n\u201cthey,\u201d to indicate the salience of persons as the central\npuzzle in situations. It is the mission of narrative, as\nFernandez might say, to promote inchoate pronouns into\ncharacters and in so doing to clarify, specify, and certify\nthe moral nature of those characters, their actions, and\nthe state of the onrolling plot. One sees the rudiments,\nthe barest sketch, of such a narrative movement in the\nPledge of Allegiance: an \u201cI,\u201d the pupil speaking the\npledge, makes a moral commitment to a \u201cwe,\u201d namely,\n\u201cthe nation,\u201d \u201cthe republic,\u201d the \u201call,\u201d and so both the\n\u201cI\u201d and the \u201cwe\u201d gain focus and purpose. Ian Kershaw\u2019s\n(1998) biography of Hitler shows a much more elaborated\nuse of story: the dictator would respond to emergencies\nby subjecting those around him to monologues, usually\nbeginning early in the history of the Nazi movement and\nfollowing events up to the present situation, placing\nhimself at the centre. The force of such monologues,\nwearing as they were, was to reorient Hitler and those\naround him to him as the protagonist of history and to\nthemselves as purposeful and consistent agents as well,\nso that they could deal with onrushing events appro-\npriately.\nNot all elaborated stories are monologues, however:\nmy wife and I, for example, are in the habit of recounting\nthe day\u2019s significant events to one another in the eve-\nning, in part for therapeutic effect. If something difficult\nor traumatic has occurred, the recounting of events by\none and the subsequent discussion and commentary by\n444 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nboth settle \u201cthe moral significance of the situation\u201d and\nhelp to lay the ground for further action. These become\nstories jointly told, like those considered by Ochs and\nCapps (2002).\nStories can also be compact, brief, and allusive. For\nexample, uttered at the right time in the right tone to\nthe right audience with the appropriate experience of the\nsituation, \u201cI thought she was my friend\u201d (Gergen and\nGergen 1984) carries a whole plot line, and nothing more\nneed be said (though it probably would be). Caesar could\nsay simply, \u201cVeni, vidi, vici,\u201d and in the circumstances\nhe spoke volumes. And when, in his televised January\n2002 State of the Union Address to Congress and Amer-\nicans in general, George W. Bush spoke of an \u201caxis of\nevil,\u201d including Iraq, North Korea, and Iran, that brief\nstory seed encapsulated a vast moral tale. In Americans\u2019\nnarrative awareness of the past, the Axis stands for Ger-\nmany, Japan, and Italy in World War II, a war which\nAmericans understand to have been waged justly, against\nevil foes. So through that single phrase, and through the\nslippage of the imagination set off by it, any eventual\naction toward the \u201caxis of evil\u201d would seem self-evident,\ncompelling, blessed in the light of that precedent. Indeed,\nthe sheer brevity of the story seed is in itself persuasive,\nfor in its brevity it demands instant comprehension\nwhile discouraging a search in leisure among other pos-\nsibilities, other interpretations.\nAnd in fact Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union address\ndisplays plainly all the features of reality we would ex-\npect from this third thread in anthropological thought:\nthe inchoate, historicity, and culture-as-persuasion. The\n\u201caxis-of-evil\u201d story seed appears at the end of the intro-\nductory section of the speech, a section which gives a\ncompacted account of events since the destruction of the\nTwin Towers. The gist of that narrative argument is cap-\ntured in its first lines:\nMr. Speaker, Vice-President Cheney, members of\nCongress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens\u2014as\nwe gather tonight, our nation is at war, our econ-\nomy is in recession, and the civilized world faces\nunprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our Union\nhas never been stronger. (Applause.)\nWe last met in an hour of shock and suffering. In\nfour short months, our nation has comforted the vic-\ntims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon,\nrallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid\nthe world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Af-\nghanistan\u2019s terrorist training camps, saved a people\nfrom starvation, and freed a country from brutal op-\npression. (Applause.)\nThe American flag flies again over our embassy in\nKabul. Terrorists who once occupied Afghanistan\nnow occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.)\nAnd terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice\ntheir lives are running for their own. (Applause.)\nThe allusion in the story seed \u201cWe last met in an hour\nof shock and suffering\u201d is to a speech by Bush to Congress\nfollowing the attack on the Towers. But beyond that al-\nlusion it also sets the attack itself as the terminus a quo,\nthe beginning of subsequent events. From our point of\nview, it represents the inchoate, the otherwise unac-\ncountable, and, here, the very threatening \u201cdark at the\ntop of the stairs\u201d which Bush interprets, tames, and sets\nin a story line for his audience. Tom Junod has pointed\nout\u2014concerning those photographing the Towers\u2019 de-\nstruction\u2014that \u201cin the actual moment history is made,\nit is usually made in terror and confusion, and so it is\nup to . . . paid witnesses . . . to attend to its manufacture\u201d\n(Observer, September 7, 2003). From that perspective,\nBush is but one of the paid witnesses, one of the inter-\npreting workers\u2014though much farther down the line and\nwielding much greater power\u2014labouring on the site of\nthe destruction. By setting the Towers\u2019 destruction as\nthe beginning of events he ensures that all subsequent\naction, including the action against Iraq implied by the\nlater \u201caxis-of-evil\u201d statement, will be seen against that\nstarting point. An earlier starting point for the narra-\ntive\u2014one that might ask, Why did the terrorists do this?\nand seek a beginning in America\u2019s confrontations in the\nMiddle East\u2014is thereby cut decisively from consider-\nation. This story, implies Bush, starts with the attack in\nNew York, just as World War II began for Americans with\nthe attack on Pearl Harbor, and so \u201cOur nation is at war,\u201d\neven though it might in sober reflection be difficult to\nsee a compelling analogy between fighting terrorists and\nfighting the armed might of counterpoised nations.\nThe verbs of the plotline show success from that be-\nginning\u2014\u201ccomforted,\u201d \u201crebuilt,\u201d \u201crallied,\u201d \u201ccaptured,\u201d\n\u201carrested,\u201d \u201cfreed\u201d\u2014and the characters show a world\nsimplified, intelligible, and manipulable. On one side\nstand Bush and the officials of Congress and government,\nwho are blended into a \u201cwe\u201d which, in turn, embraces\nhis \u201cfellow citizens,\u201d \u201cour nation,\u201d and \u201cour Union.\u201d\nThis is a play of individual persons, for example, Cheney\nand Bush, set together with those increasingly compre-\nhensive collective nouns which appear in the Pledge of\nAllegiance and is therefore a slippage of the cultural\nimagination creating a great unified collective subject.\nHe also reaches out to include \u201cthe civilized world\u201d and\n\u201ca great coalition,\u201d setting this \u201cwe\u201d in an even larger\nframe. As against that unified \u201cwe,\u201d the \u201cthey\u201d are only\ncharacterized as \u201cterrorists,\u201d persons so far beyond \u201cthe\ncivilized world\u201d that their incarceration in the camp at\nGuantanamo Bay is not only right but celebrated with\napplause. This section is then rounded off by a suggestion\nwhich I, a long-time fan of Western movies, can recog-\nnize easily: the villains \u201crun for their lives,\u201d so \u201cwe\u201d\nmount and gallop after them.\nIn this brief sample Bush lays out for us all the work\nof culture against the flow of historicity. He and his\nspeech writers, moral agents all, man and woman, take\ncultural tools lying to hand\u2014a well-practised rhetoric of\nthe national \u201cwe,\u201d a story line drawn from recent history,\na plot rehearsed in fiction\u2014and weld them into a nar-\nrative which tames the inchoate and leads with a sense\nof inevitability to a plan, war on the \u201caxis of evil.\u201d And\nwhat Bush and his speech writers offer us above all is\nmoral certainty, a world simplified and shorn of para-\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 445\nlyzing doubts and subtle shading. If those events were\nterrible and darkly puzzling, then they have matched\nthem with bright certainty.\nBut of course this speech and others to follow, com-\nbined with the actions explained thereby, were in the\niron grip of historicity and would lead to other inchoate\nsituations and so to the need for further interpretations,\nfurther speeches, further actions. Meanwhile we, the an-\nthropologists, stand to one side, blessed and cursed, like\nMusil\u2019s protagonist Ulrich, with \u201cthe ability to think of\nwhat could just as well be,\u201d the ability to see that quite\ndifferent interpretations could have reigned. Does this\nknowledge have moral worth and import?\nDrawing the Threads Together\nThe work I have done here is not only to think about\ncurrent anthropological knowledge and its moral import\nbut also to test this knowledge in the light of those\nevents which rolled up to the destruction of the Twin\nTowers and onward to the war on Iraq and beyond. Can\nanthropology as such offer a moralizing answer? Can I\nspeak as an anthropologist or only as, say, a citizen of\nthe world like everyone else or as an American?\nThe first thread I have picked up is that of cultural\nrelativism. To experience the insight of cultural relativ-\nism, I have argued, is to step through a one-way door and\naway from naive moral certainties. On one hand, this\nsuggests that the carefully polished moral certainty dem-\nonstrated in Bush\u2019s speech will be unacceptable, but on\nthe other, along with Rorty\u2019s (1989) ironist, I cannot\nplace ultimate confidence in any other single language\nof thought, in any one morality or cosmology. Yet it is\na long way from naive moral certainty to its supposed\nnightmare opposite, total moral relativism. Where can\none balance between the two?\nThe second thread is that of anthropological fieldwork.\nHere I have made, in essence, three suggestions. The first\nis that the scholarly ethic of faithfulness in interpreta-\ntion is matched by a personal ethic which arises in the\nfieldwork situation. That ethic leads from the grass roots\nof experience upwards rather than from abstract princi-\nple downwards. It comprises a sense of others\u2019 worth and\nof mutual trust. I have suggested that anthropological\nknowledge is (increasingly) infected by the sense of oth-\ners\u2019 worth, such that what one says about the others\nshould be reasonably close to what one says to them\u2014\nan ethic now enshrined in our professional codes of con-\nduct. This suggests in turn an intensity of regard based\nin participation \u201cin the onrolling life of the other.\u201d So\nthe question arises: does the political rhetoric of Bush\nand his fellows reflect such a careful sense of others\u2019\nworth? Manifestly it does not. It might be objected that\ncriteria arising in face-to-face relations such as I have\noffered here cannot be applied to matters of state, which\nobey a different logic. But I take heart, first, from the\nexample of Ju\u00a8rgen Habermas (1981), who drew many of\nhis compelling ideas about moral political discourse ul-\ntimately from the moral logic of face-to-face relations,\nand, second, from the evolving thought of international\nlaw, which struggles with some success to apply stan-\ndards of personal accountability to acts of state (Robert-\nson 1999). Nevertheless, the judgment we must make\nhere\u2014that the rhetoric leading to war contravened the\nhard-won moral aesthetic of anthropology\u2014must always\nbe held in balance with those other possibilities and the\nalternative worldviews that crowd around so momen-\ntous an event.\nMy second suggestion from fieldwork is that anthro-\npological knowledge requires forbearance and, indeed, a\nforbearance that will allow one to enter into and under-\nstand another\u2019s point of view while still holding one\u2019s\nown. In practice this is a corollary of interpretative faith-\nfulness, adding only the proviso that one must be able\nto follow, in imagination, others\u2019 reasonings, experi-\nences, and intentions very far indeed and so may find\noneself sometimes very far from one\u2019s home base of ev-\neryday moral action\u2014an observation as applicable to the\nrhetoric of Bush as to that of extreme Islamists.\nMy third suggestion from fieldwork is that we must\nnow, as we have long done, recognize the slant of an-\nthropological knowledge\u2014its orientation to and orien-\ntation by its attention to those less privileged than an-\nthropologists themselves. One could say that anthro-\npologists study in the interest of those less powerful and\nmake a case for an anthropological critique of power in\nthe name of the powerless. In 1966 Hortense Powder-\nmaker noted the difficulties of \u201cupward anthropology,\u201d\nthe study of those more powerful, and in 1972 Laura\nNader took this observation to entail \u201cstudying up\u201d as\ndischarging an obligation to those below. The equivalent\ntoday would be to study, say, the organization of the\nWorld Bank in order to reveal its ideological foundations\nand therefore its systematic affect upon the Third World:\nanthropology as critique of the world order. I think that\nthere is a great deal in this that would suggest a moral\nbasis for the understanding of Bush\u2019s rhetoric and for\nasking the question: what are they trying to do to us\nwith this rhetoric? At the same time, such analysis\nwould still need to avoid tempting simplicities and\ncertainties.\nThe third and final thread is that of historicity as the\nincessantly shifting ground on which anthropological\nknowledge is based. On one hand, this is a more radical\nvision than that of a static array of cultures, for those\ncultures themselves are now seen as temporary, provi-\nsional, subject to change, and so subject to pervading\ndoubt. On the other hand, moral agency-cum-patiency\nis part of that process, and it arises from the same grass\nroots as the ethics of fieldwork. People can and do act\nas if according to some universal morality, even though\ntheir roots lie in particular experience and an improvis-\ning social aesthetics: a difficult doctrine but at least one\nbearing some hope. And finally, these considerations\ngain importance through the observation that the human\nworld is constituted of a myriad of interconnections, a\nweb of actions and reactions which reach far beyond any\none person\u2019s intimate acquaintance. The anthropological\nknowledge of this richly interconnected and continually\n446 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nchanging world is more complex than ethnography once\naspired to be, and the moral charge it bears is at once\nmore poignant and compelling and more difficult to\nconfirm.\nYet here, finally, I think we can alight, at least for the\ntime being. In the human web there are some who have\nmore weight and whose movements shake the web for\nothers more roughly. There is a relationship as I write\nbetween me and those in George Bush\u2019s White House,\njust as there is a relationship between me and those in\nTony Blair\u2019s No. 10 Downing Street, and that is a rela-\ntionship which many others share. I am toward the rel-\natively privileged and comfortable end of the web,\nwhereas there are Iraqis and others in the Middle East\nand elsewhere who are not so privileged. But compared\nwith those in Washington and London who shake and\nmove, I stand with the millions on the weaker side, not\nwith those few on the stronger. It follows from the cat-\negory of moral agency-cum-patiency that these relation-\nships are morally accountable, just because they are re-\nlationships: that is our human condition.\nWhat, then, are we on this side of the web\u2014far greater\nin number, far less in political weight\u2014owed by those\non the other side? Well, we are owed an account, and\nthat account should match our worth and establish trust.\nThis account is a right which we may always demand,\na right founded in intersubjective and in anthropological\nknowledge. I know that the human world comprises tre-\nmendous and constantly changing variety. I know that\nmutual trust and mutual forbearance can arise even\nwhile people on opposite sides of the forbearance still\nraise their children and treat their students according to\nparticular, and differing, moralities. I know that any\nblanket judgment across this variegated landscape must\nbe nuanced, careful, and humble. I demand that these\nconditions be acknowledged and that any account I am\noffered show awareness of the web itself, of its inter-\nconnectedness, of the possibilities that swarm around\nthe certainties of the Realpolitiker. I demand something\nfar less certain, far more difficult, far more than bright\nsimplicities. Can we rely on such possibilities, on a view\nthat, as Musil says, \u201cit could probably be otherwise\u201d?\nCertainly we can.\nComments\ndon brenneis\nDepartment of Anthropology, Social Sciences 1,\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064,\nU.S.A.

His essay points\nto principled ways of wrestling with and coming to un-\nderstand complex moral questions and phenomena and\nto an imaginative and compelling re-visioning of our\nfield.\nI want here to respond primarily to Carrithers\u2019s focus\non narrative and rhetoric. A framing notion in the essay\nis the subjunctive voice often characteristic of anthro-\npological research and writing at its best. Carrithers\u2019s\nown rhetoric in the essay beautifully exemplifies this\nkind of principled subjunctivity. His approach resonates\npowerfully with Jerome Bruner\u2019s (1986) detailed consid-\neration of the subjunctive voice. More recently, Am-\nsterdam and Bruner have suggested the notion of \u201cnoetic\nspace,\u201d an \u201cimaginative space teeming with alternatives\nto the actual\u201d (2000:237)\u2014a resource for the shaping and\ncritical reception of, in their discussion, legal narratives.\nCarrithers\u2019s essay clearly demonstrates the broad use-\nfulness of treating such an imaginative space as highly\nsocial, one in which both stories and the shapes of so-\nciality can be envisioned.\nImplicit in Carrithers\u2019s discussion of narrative is the\ncentrality of analogy, of our capacity for hearing in one\nnarrative the resonances of others and for teasing out\nparallels between story and those quotidian and more\nmarked sequences of events in which we participate and\nthat, as anthropologists, we study. Finding analogies,\nwhether to other stories or to the raw materials of on-\ngoing social life, is rarely neutral. We have our own pre-\nconceptions and interests, and others often are deeply\nconcerned to guide us toward the recognition of some\npossible parallels and away from others. One way of\nthinking about the rhetorical strategies and practices\nCarrithers discusses is, indeed, to consider them as ways\nof pointing toward desired connections, analogies that\nmake sense within the somewhat flexible arena defined\nby culture as resource and repertoire rather than tem-\nplate. Kenneth Burke argued that \u201cidentification\u201d is a\nkey rhetorical goal and that individuals work to move\ntheir interlocutors toward a sense of \u201cconsubstantiality\u201d\nwith the subjects of their performances and writings\n(1950:19\u201327). This Burkean notion of identification is\nanalogous in some significant ways to the Schutzean\nMitmenschlichkeit that Carrithers examines. It also may\nwell, in a more explicitly rhetorical vein, underlie many\nof the specific tactics that Carrithers, following Fernan-\ndez, notes.\nCarrithers\u2019s careful disentanglement of agency and pa-\ntiency is central to his argument. It also is a key insight\nfor thinking about rhetoric, in which strategy and inten-\ntion must always be considered vis-a`-vis the interpretive\nand appreciative capacities that listeners bring to per-\nformance. Skill in sending a message is not enough; the\napparently patient audience often has and frequently ex-\nerts consequential agency.\nNarratives necessarily involve the passage of time, pro-\nviding a sequential rather than a momentary view of\nsocial action. And here Carrithers\u2019s essay is further val-\nuable for pointing to the ongoing, always present moral\njunctures both in the stories we tell and in the lives we\nlive and study. An old Protestant hymn has it that \u201conce\nto every man and nation comes the moment to decide.\u201d\nThings are, however, rarely that simple. In reality we\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 447\ncontinue to be always actively involved in laying down\nour own narrative trajectories. Even within the relatively\nrestricted ambit of an ethnographic research project, for\nexample, anthropologists are engaged in ongoing\nchoices\u2014about what topics are valuable to study, about\nhow we shape our relationships with (and are shaped by)\nour consultants, about how we represent those with\nwhom we have worked, and the like. A system of moral\naccounting that fixes upon only one of these moments\nas the proxy for ethical practice (as do many human-\nsubjects policies) both misrecognizes moral moments\nand limits our moral imaginations.\nCarrithers\u2019s essay focuses in many ways on accounts\u2014\nthe stories through which, as persons and as ethnogra-\nphers, we narrate the social lives of ourselves and oth-\ners\u2014and on the ways in which, at once singular and\ntaken as similar, they shape our shared social worlds.\nSuch accounts contrast dramatically with the notions of\nstrict, measurable accountability that often shape cur-\nrent ethical debates, for example, in the use of formal\nkinds of risk\/benefit analysis. Accountability in this lat-\nter sense reflects a world in which mutual trust is, at\nbest, tenuous. Among the lingering values of this essay\nis its offering a vision of anthropological research in\nwhich such trust can be both imagined and jointly\npursued.\njames w. fernandez\nDepartment of Anthropology, University of Chicago,\n1126 E. 59th St., Chicago, IL 60637, U.S.A. (jwf1@\nuchicago.edu). 10 i 05\nCarrithers offers a welcome argument exploring the in-\nescapable pertinence of the \u201cm\u201d word to anthropological\ninquiry. The predecessors of our human science, the\neighteenth-century Enlightenment philosophers, regu-\nlarly referred to their interest in human nature as \u201cmoral\nphilosophy.\u201d Durkheim (1993) had a pronounced interest\nin the moral implications of his sociological positivism,\nand Geertz (1968) contemplated anthropological think-\ning itself \u201cas a Moral Act.\u201d Yet it has been my experience\nover the years, in exploring the relevance of the idea of\nmoral imagination to anthropology (Fernandez 2001b),\nthat there is a discomfort when one introduces issues of\nthe moral into discussions of anthropological practice\nand understanding.\nThere are various reasons for this discomfort, among\nthem\u2014to use the old Aristotelean dichotomy\u2014a higher\nregard in the academy for intellectual than for moral\nvirtue. We may even recognize, at least in American an-\nthropology, a reaction against that strain of self-congrat-\nulatory and judgmental exceptionalism in our culture,\nfound in its puritan foundations\u2014its manifest destinies,\nits moral majorities, its present politics of evangelical\nconviction.\nWith those contexts in mind, would it be too much\nto understand anthropology, as I believe Carrithers does,\nas a kind of \u201ccalling\u201d? While the \u201cmoral science\u201d he\nsuggests may not want to include the reference to \u201cdi-\nvine presence\u201d often evoked in the word \u201ccalling,\u201d he\ndoes see the profession as a kind of summons to consider\nthe worth of \u201cothers\u201d and their value as interlocutors\nconcerning the consternations of the human condition.\nThis value can arise from the discovery of a certain\n\u201csameness\u201d or coeval condition, a facing together of the\nfact that humans in extended interaction are, as he says,\n\u201cgrowing old together.\u201d This common sense of the in-\nevitabilities of time in the human condition at large sug-\ngests a morality of mutual recognition and sympathetic\nforbearance in the framing of our discussions.3 As a con-\nsequence of that openness and generosity of spirit and\nwhat it enables us to learn, the anthropological calling\nis enriched by a sense of the multitudinous possibilities\nof being human. It is therefore resistant\u2014and this also\nis as much a moral as a scientific posture\u2014to dogmatic\ndefinitions of the human both for culture in general and\nfor the particular cultures under scrutiny. It is enriched\nby the sense that in any particular understandings and\nbalancings of the human equation we espouse \u201cit (or\nthey) could always have been otherwise.\u201d\nThere are of course cultures which are themselves so\nself-regarding and intercultural conditions so full of en-\nmities that the possibility of such a \u201ccalling\u201d and the\npractice of openness is foreclosed. Ethnography would be\npracticable only through questionable subterfuge. And\nthere are also anthropologists who naturally enough en-\nter the field entirely inspired by the ambition to intel-\nlectual virtue. The sense of coevality and time\u2019s hurrying\non may not be as strong with them, their condition as\nMitmenschen less evident. Yet, as I think Carrithers sug-\ngests, as time in the field increases, as anthropology\u2019s\ncommitment to long-term field research warrants, the\n\u201cmoral virtues\u201d challenged by the many voices and sto-\nries present in and prompted by coevality become more\nand more evident. In the field, if we are there long\nenough, we are confronted with the moral problem of\nwith whom to work to gather our materials and, with\nthe Rashomon effect in mind, whose voices, among the\nmany voices, are to be listened to as sources for our\neventual account of \u201cotherness\u201d and \u201csameness.\u201d Even\nthe attribution of otherness is itself touched with moral\nambiguity, since there are those who do not wish to\nthink of themselves as \u201cother\u201d at all.\nI am particularly sympathetic to Carrithers\u2019s view that\nan important part of our openness to the other must be\nan openness to the poetics of everyday life\u2014that is, as\nhe sees it, \u201cthe everyday slippages\u201d by which the un-\ncertainties of daily life are creatively confronted and\ncomposed, often in narrative form. Carrithers speaks of\nthis composition as a moral aesthetics of the everyday,\npresent in the life of the \u201cother\u201d and present as well for\nthe anthropologist at work among others. Perhaps the\nword \u201csynesthesia\u201d would be an enrichment to the no-\n3. Fabian\u2019s (1984) discussion of the long resistance in the discipline\nto the recognition of coevality of anthropologist and informant and\nthe obligation for its acceptance, while distinguished by its intel-\nlectual virtuosity (or virtue), is surely also a book of rare moral\nvirtue in anthropology.\n448 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\ntion of moral aesthetics, for it suggests the way in which\na lifeway is a moving through different realms of expe-\nrience by the cross-referencing of domains of experience.\nAnd this composition of various revelatory domains of\nexperience is of the very nature of the storytelling that\ngoes on so constantly in everyday life. An awareness of\nthis is, as I understand Carrithers, at the heart of the\n\u201cmoral science\u201d that he advances. While I would not go\nso far as to suggest that ethnography itself is simply sto-\nrytelling, it is surely narrative composition dependent in\nimportant part on hearing the storytelling going on in\nculture and faced with the moral dilemma of choosing\nthe voices and events out of which one\u2019s own ethno-\ngraphic \u201ctelling\u201d is to be fashioned. This is perhaps the\nultimate moral to the tale of ethnographic commitment.\njames j . fox\nResearch School of Pacific and Asian Studies, The\nAustralian National University, Building 9, HC\nCoombs Building, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia\n(jjf400@coombs.anu.edu). 9 i 05\nCarrithers has focused much of his engaging and highly\npersonal reflection on \u201canthropology as a moral science\nof possibilities\u201d on ethnographic practice and the expe-\nriences of fieldwork. It therefore seems appropriate to\noffer a response that draws its observations from similar\npractice and experience.\nIn describing the entwined understanding of others\nthat arises in fieldwork, Carrithers gives emphasis to an\n\u201cengaged learning\u201d on the part of the anthropologist that\noccasions new moral possibilities. I would place equal\nstress on the engagement in learning that occurs on the\npart of the community that opens itself to the anthro-\npologist. Most anthropologists spend years training for\nfieldwork and have usually imbibed the folklore sur-\nrounding its practice. By contrast, the community has\nhad no such preparation for the arrival of the anthro-\npologist and only rarely has any glimmer of awareness\nof an anthropological agenda. Acceptance of the stranger\ncan thus be a more radical moment of moral engagement\nthan that experienced by the anthropologist. Accounts\nfrom the perspective of the community are rare indeed,\nand anthropologists\u2019 accounts of these perspectives may\nnot properly represent them. I confess that, to this day,\nI cannot fathom the conflicting motivations and ima-\nginings that percolated among members of the com-\nmunity that accepted me for my first fieldwork.\nInvariably initial acceptance is not unanimous but of-\nfered by just a few members of a community, some of\nwhom may become close partners in a process of mu-\ntually engaged learning. (In Carrithers\u2019s adaptation of\nSchu\u00a8tz\u2019s terminology, these individuals could be re-\ngarded as the anthropologist\u2019s \u201cconsociates or Mit-\nmenschen.\u201d) Nor is it always easy for such individuals.\nAfter some weeks of limited socializing, the elder\u2014\u201cOld\nMeno\u201d\u2014who was to become my closest research partner\nduring my first period of fieldwork on the island of Roti\nconfessed to me that he had had sleepless nights won-\ndering why I had come and what I intended to do. When\nhe finally decided to work with me, he explained that\nhe did so because he realized that I had, with my tape\nrecorder, the possibility of transmitting his knowledge\nto his grandchildren. Mutual acceptance of an engage-\nment of this sort does more than reflect new moral pos-\nsibilities. In a society like that of the Rotinese, it imposes\nmoral rights and obligations. This, years later, imposed\nupon me the responsibility for performing, with his fam-\nily, Meno\u2019s final mortuary rituals (for an account of these\nceremonies, see Fox 1989).\nIn response to Carrithers\u2019s reflections, I would also\nnote that fieldwork is a two-way street in opening for\nconsideration alternative possibilities of human life. On\nstorytelling nights among the Rotinese, I would on oc-\ncasion take my turn by describing other societies, fo-\ncusing on interesting marriage practices such as Nuer\nghost marriage, Nayar matriliny, or Himalayan fraternal\npolyandry. Often I was called upon to retell such ac-\ncounts and give my authoritative assurance that indeed\nothers actually married as I explained. Contemplation of\nthese alternative possibilities probably confirmed most\nof my Rotinese listeners in the rightness of their com-\nplicated bridewealth negotiations, but no one, as far as\nI can recall, expressed outrage. The contemplation of al-\nternative ways of living was well within the scope of\nRotinese consideration. Whereas most members of a so-\nciety may act within their culture, they can think beyond\nit. A few may even act beyond it. This may be no dif-\nferent from the situation of some anthropologists.\nel isa j . gordon\nNeiswanger Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy,\nStritch School of Medicine, Bldg. 120, Rm. 280, Loyola\nUniversity of Chicago, 2160 S.

(egordo1@1umc.edu). 10 i 05\nIn a dramatic and verbose essay, Carrithers ponders a\nvariation on a classic question in anthropology: whether\nit is acceptable for anthropologists to hold a moral com-\npass to political administrations, including the Bush\nWhite House. As an anthropologist, bioethicist, and pub-\nlic health advocate, I propose that his concern, while\nadmirable, is overstated and misdirected.\nCarrithers\u2019s concern about passing judgment is over-\nstated in terms of the restrictions placed on the profes-\nsion (cultural relativism). For example, he asks, \u201cCan I\nspeak as an anthropologist or only as, say, a citizen of\nthe world like everyone else or as an American?\u201d This\nquestion reflects a lack of recognition of applied anthro-\npological work. One need only look to the public state-\nments by the anthropologists William Beeman and Jan-\nine Wedel, among others, to realize that some\nanthropologists do not refrain from participating in pub-\nlic discourse but still hold on to the tenets of our pro-\nfession. Beeman and Wedel, for example, use their an-\nthropological expertise to advocate against the war in\nIraq and the ban on gay marriage.\nCarrithers raises a fascinating point about the possi-\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 449\nbilities that arise from anthropological knowledge of di-\nverse human lifeways\u2014that this knowledge may have\nmoral worth and import. In other words, anthropologists\ncan offer insights into the moral basis of policies by high-\nlighting alternative cultural frameworks guiding those\npolicies. He demonstrates this point by engaging in crit-\nical discourse analysis of the concept of an \u201caxis of evil\u201d\nin President Bush\u2019s 2002 State of the Union address,\npointing out that this statement and the policy upon\nwhich it is based constitute a cultural and historical nar-\nrative. Oddly, he drops the ball on the practical appli-\ncations of this idea of possibilities when he critiques the\nBush administration: he states that it \u201cowes us an ac-\ncount\u201d because it and the public (including anthropol-\nogists) are in a moral relationship. While he passes judg-\nment on the White House for not having accounted for\nits policies and actions, his efforts stop short of providing\na practical way for anthropologists to use the notion of\npossibilities in evaluating political administrations.\nI posit that anthropologists can act upon the moral\nworth and import of anthropological knowledge and\nmake evaluations of political administrations within our\ndisciplinary bounds by examining whether the analysis\nused to justify policy is sound. Unlike politicians and\ntheir supporters, who are focused on maintaining their\npolitical careers and political theories, anthropologists\nare well equipped with cross-cultural insights and the\nability to translate and understand cultures. This helps\nus to make assessments of public policy based on an\nunderstanding of the diverse values of populations and\neven to help policy makers understand people\u2019s likely\nresponses to the policies under scrutiny. This provides\nan avenue for public advocacy: we can determine\nwhether a policy is sound by analyzing whether the cul-\ntural assumptions that inspired it are consistent with\nthe cultural currents (Romney, Weller, and Batchelder\n1986) of the people who are subject to that policy. For\nexample, had the White House heard from anthropolo-\ngists before the war, the president would have under-\nstood that Iraqis would not unquestioningly welcome\nAmerican troops, that imposing cultural values upon a\npeople, even in the name of democracy, is an ineffective\nway to produce cultural change, and even that armies\nare not tapping into \u201chuman nature\u201d by creating a new\nelectoral system but creating pressures that will have\nunpredictable results.\nAnthropologists can critique the assumptions under-\nlying policies rather than the culture or cultural values\nthemselves. Certainly they are no better equipped to as-\nsess morality than others. It is a hopeless endeavor to be\nconcerned with establishing or working with a moral\ncompass; as anthropologists working in the field of\nbioethics point out, there are no universal moral stan-\ndards for ethical decisions. While our knowledge has\nmoral import, no moral compass is required for evalu-\nating policies and political administrations.\ncarl-go\u00a8ran heidegren\nDepartment of Sociology, Lund University, Box 114,\n221 00 Lund, Sweden (carlgoran.heidegren@soc.lu.se).\n6 i 05\nNietzsche\u2014in an aphorism in Beyond Good and Evil\u2014\nremarked that man is \u201cthe not yet fixed animal\u201d (das\nnoch nicht festgestellte Tier). That remark was later\ntaken up by Arnold Gehlen and integrated into the tra-\ndition of German philosophical anthropology. Nietz-\nsche\u2019s remark, according to Gehlen (1950), has a double\nmeaning: first, no one knows what man really is, in the\nsense that no one knows what (for better or worse) man\nis capable of, and, secondly, man is an unfinished being\nor a being still in the making. Gehlen takes as his point\nof departure the statement that man, in comparison with\nother animals, is a \u201cdefective being\u201d (Ma\u00a8ngelwesen).\nHowever, he also suggests that man could just as well\nbe characterized as essentially a \u201cfantasizing being\u201d\n(Phantasiewesen), endowed with a developed capacity to\ntranscend the here and now, that which is the case, and\nto imagine what could have been the case, as well as\nwhat could, might, or should be the case in the future.\nFurthermore, at one point Gehlen speaks of man as es-\nsentially a risk-taking being that does not shun difficult\nand dangerous situations but rather becomes stimulated\nin the presence of danger and challenges. In this sense\nman is a being endowed not only with a sense of reality\nbut also with a strong sense of possibility, a capacity\nwithout which man would probably not have been able\nto survive in the midst of skilful predators and swift-\nfooted prey. However, Gehlen himself opted for what can\nbe called a social-order anthropology in which the basic\nproblem is how the necessity of a social\u2014normative and\ninstitutional\u2014order can be derived from human nature.\nBut given his insistence on man as a fantasizing and risk-\ntaking being, he might just as well have opted for an\nanthropology of transcendence, in which the basic prob-\nlem is how man\u2019s constant readiness to transcend ex-\nisting institutions and social orders can be explained\nwith reference to human nature. All in all, given that\nman is the not-yet-fixed animal, anthropology can no\ndoubt be called a science of possibilities. But is it also a\nmoral science of possibilities?\nAnthropological knowledge, informed by acquain-\ntance and engagement with foreign cultures very differ-\nent from our own, tries to steer its way between naive\nmoral certainty and total moral relativism. The basic\nlesson to be learned from an anthropological view of cul-\nture is that there are different ways to tame the incho-\nate\u2014that there is always another story to be told. The\nbasic moral lesson to be learned, as I interpret Carrithers,\nis to show a readiness to listen to these other stories and\nrespect the human worth of those other storytellers. To\nhave an ear for other versions and interpretations means\nbeing open to other possibilities. In that sense anthro-\npological knowledge amounts to a morality of mutual\nrecognition, mutual trust, and mutual forbearance. In\ncontrast, culture-as-persuasion tries to convey a sense of\nmoral certainty as to the one true version of what is the\n450 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\ncase (whether it is the version of the Bush administration\nor that of Usama bin Laden). To see through culture-as-\npersuasion means to become aware of a cloud of other\npossibilities: to have an ear for stories yet unheard, an\neye for what might perhaps just as well be the case. What\nCarrithers\u2019s interesting article amounts to is an anthro-\npology of transcendence in the sense of a moral science\nof possibilities not with reference to human nature but\nwith reference to human culture. Anthropology, under-\nstood in this way, is a moral science of possibilities with-\nout strong foundational claims but based on contingent\nexperiences that might be gained in anthropological\nfieldwork (although not only there\u2014here as elsewhere,\nthere are other possibilities)\u2014experiences that place the\nanthropologist on the side of those being shaken and\nmoved rather than those who shake and move things in\nthe world, a position from which it is possible to claim\nthat what the latter owe us is a morally convincing ac-\ncount of the actions they take.\nalcida rita ramos\nSQN 107 Bloco I Apto. 601, 70-743-090 Bras\u0131\u00b4lia, DF,\nBrazil (arramos@unb.br). 11 i 05\nFor someone who, as I do, takes anthropology to be an\nethical\/political endeavor, this paper conveys a message\nof reassurance that is rare in the profession. Particularly\ncongenial is the author\u2019s uninhibited use of anthropo-\nlogical resources to ground a moral stance not only with\nregard to our ethnographic subjects but also with regard\nto major issues that affect, at least potentially, the whole\nworld. In his defense of a morally informed anthropology\nCarrithers develops a conceptual framework at once the-\noretically sophisticated, heuristically fruitful, and polit-\nically lucid. That he seeks inspiration in a fiction writer\nto make a point about the historicity of everyday life is\nperhaps a symptom that new ideas in anthropology have\nlittle impact. Ironically, Musil\u2019s \u201cman without qualities\u201d\nor, as Carrithers interprets him, man with virtually un-\nlimited possibilities could easily be an anthropologist for\nwhom established truths have no place and cultural rel-\nativism dissolves uncritical certainties.\nIrony is for Carrithers a privileged trope in unraveling\ncontradictions and differences of opinion that are equally\nlegitimate in the social setting where they occur. How-\never, given its importance in this article and, for that\nmatter, in social analysis in general, it is a pity that the\ndiscussion of irony is not developed here as it deserves\nto be. The reader is left to infer the special importance\nof irony from specific examples, even though the author\nstates that his interest is mostly in its \u201cphilosophical\ndimension,\u201d meaning that conflicting positions are often\nat stake at the same time in the same context. From the\n\u201cTory Blair\u201d example one has the impression that irony\nworks as a sort of conscious slip of the tongue, a delib-\nerate play at saying without actually saying. But else-\nwhere, as in the example of the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights, irony closely resembles what we usu-\nally understand cultural relativism to be. Both concepts\npoint to differences, but what is the difference between\nthem when it comes to orienting the anthropologist\u2019s\njudgment, whether moral, ethical, or political? What po-\ntency is there in the notion of irony that is absent in the\nconcept of cultural relativism but, however understated,\na powerful political dimension? Actually, the less ex-\nplicit the irony, the sharper and more effectual it is.\nWhile the trope of irony remains implicit, the prom-\nising concept of moral aesthetics is more clearly spelled\nout. Reminiscent of Goffman\u2019s relational analyses and\nof Leach\u2019s pragmatics of ritual, moral aesthetics high-\nlights the component of improvisation in social inter-\naction. In trying to interpret meaningful misunderstand-\nings between anthropologist and research subjects (a\nphenomenon that is more common in field situations\nthan is normally recorded or admitted), we can certainly\nbenefit from this notion. Turning seemingly unproduc-\ntive misunderstandings into productive opportunities to\ndeepen our grasp of a world of possibilities is one of the\nmost challenging aspects of doing anthropology, partic-\nularly in societies not our own. Individual creative re-\nsponses to stressful situations are among a range of cir-\ncumstances likely to arise.\nCarrithers\u2019s theorizing on what he calls a \u201cmoral sci-\nence of possibilities\u201d gives the impression of rehabili-\ntating old anthropological issues by means of a refresh-\ningly new outlook. Anthropology\u2019s persistent emphasis\non the value of cultural diversity is duly reinforced with\nadded attention to interpersonal \u201cmorally charged\u201d re-\nlationships and to the mutual influences bound to occur\nbetween anthropologist and research subjects. The au-\nthor\u2019s main point, though, seems to be not simply to\nprovide a programmatic synopsis to help ethnographers\nunveil the complexities of otherness but to expose the\nrhetoric of the powerful at its ironic best. Bush\u2019s war on\nIraq is briefly analyzed with the tools the author has\nsharpened in the course of the article. Carefully selected\nnational symbols are converted into instruments of\npower unleashed by the all-too-powerful president of the\nall-too-powerful United States. But again, the promise of\na penetrating analysis of this overpowering event is un-\nfortunately cut short. Potent cultural symbols are no-\ntorious instruments of power for political leaders who\nchoose persuasion rather than arms as a means of achiev-\ning internal consent. Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s rhetorical\nstrength came from culturally saturated narratives of old\ndeeds of excruciating human suffering and courage (Fi-\nscher 1980). That native cosmologies lend legitimacy to\nambitious rulers has been dramatically demonstrated in\nthe history of such diverse peoples as the Kwakiutl, the\nAztecs, and the Germans (Wolf 1999). The George W.\nBush affair is yet another case of the empowering appeal\nof war-cum-religion rhetoric both in the so-called West\nand in the ill-named Rest. We need a thorough ethnog-\nraphy of Bush\u2019s words and deeds to help ease the world\u2019s\ndisquiet and to test anthropology\u2019s capacity to disclose\nthe ultimate irony of transforming brute force into dem-\nagogical Christian justice.\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 451\na. c . g . m. robben\nDepartment of Anthropology, Utrecht University,\nHeidelberglaan 2, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands\n(a.c.g.m.robben@fss.uu.nl). 4 i 05\nCarrithers has put his finger on an important but un-\ndervalued quality of anthropologists: their ability to\nimagine other cultural realities, to suspend their own\ntaken-for-granted world and learn about other world-\nviews through empathic fieldwork relations. He suggests\nnot only that we practice too little imagining but that\nour capacity to conceive other possibilities can lead to\ninformed moral positions. This view is particularly rel-\nevant to situations of political violence, such as the pre-\nsent war in Iraq, precisely because people often consider\nviolence inevitable. I therefore wholeheartedly endorse\nhis appeal for a public anthropology that provides moral\nguidance and explores alternative realities, but I would\nlike to amend his view of fieldwork.\nCarrithers has a benign, if not romantic, notion of\nfieldwork that is not consistent with contemporary eth-\nnographic practice. He emphasizes the mutual trust, rec-\nognition, and sympathetic forbearance between ethnog-\nrapher and subject, and this seems reasonable and\nrepresents a fieldwork situation which many of us have\nexperienced personally. Yet, a comparison of my own\nresearch on small-scale fishing economies in northeast-\nern Brazil with that on Argentina\u2019s dirty war shows that\ndifferent political stakes lead to different fieldwork re-\nlations. My ties with Brazilian fishermen (resembling\nthose of Carrithers with Indian Jains and Sri Lankan Bud-\ndhists) were characterized by a concerted effort to un-\nravel the local fishing economy and interpret the mari-\ntime culture from the so-called native point of view.\nHowever, more than two years of fieldwork in Argentina\nyielded a different ethnographic reality. Sympathetic for-\nbearance may be consciously pursued by the anthropol-\nogist (and how hard we all try!), but it is undeniable that\nboth questions and answers in an ethnographic interview\nwith, say, a torturer are neither morally nor intersubjec-\ntively neutral but arise from implicit knowledge about\nhuman rights violations. These fieldwork relations have\na veneer of politeness and trust but are more often than\nnot characterized by deceit, lies, and what I have called\nethnographic seduction (Robben 1995, 1996). Ethno-\ngraphic seduction sidesteps the dialectic of empathy and\ndetachment so central to fieldwork. Whereas genuine\nrapport entails a dialogic relation in which informant\nand anthropologist explore the social and cultural reality\nwith sincerity and integrity, the seductive interlocutor\nleads the ethnographer intentionally or unconsciously\naway from his or her research focus through rhetorical\narguments, distorted discourse, emotional displays, and\noutward niceties.\nMistrust rules in the ethnography of violence, front-\nline anthropology, undercover ethnography, or whatever\nother term is used to describe politically charged field-\nwork situations. The ethnographic skill is to present a\npersonal front of trust while being aware that suspicion\nhides in the background for both ethnographer and sub-\nject. Mutual trust makes way for mutual suspicion that\ndevelops into a tug-of-war between attempts to discover\nand attempts to conceal darker worlds and realities that\ncannot be openly acknowledged. As a result, ethnogra-\nphers of violence do not attempt to reconcile what they\nsay to people with what they write about them but rather\ntry to write about people what they do not dare say to\nthem. I regard this lack of sincerity not as unethical but\nas an acceptable practice in the study of political\nviolence.\nCarrithers regards fieldwork as a cooperative research\npractice in which authority is distributed more or less\nevenly between ethnographer and subject in a shared ef-\nfort to translate and interpret cultural knowledge. Again,\nthis reflects my experience in Brazil but not in Argentina.\nAuthority was claimed or even demanded in a self-con-\nscious way by my interlocutors. These military officers,\nguerrilla commanders, bishops, lawyers, and human\nrights leaders tried to control the ethnographic encounter\nin time, place, content, form, and metaphor.\nThe deception, seduction, and power play existed not\nonly within the dynamic of the ethnographic relation\nbut also\u2014and here Carrithers is right on target\u2014in rhe-\ntorical persuasion. Discussing traumatic historical\nevents, my Argentine interlocutors created conflicting\nbut equally persuasive versions with such high degrees\nof detail and internal coherence that they were all con-\nvincing within their particular political discourses and\nmoral aesthetics. Such persuasive stories provided, in\nCarrithers\u2019s words, \u201cinstant comprehension while dis-\ncouraging a search in leisure among other possibilities,\nother interpretations,\u201d precisely the ethnographic se-\nduction I have just described. Together with the suspi-\ncion that pervades such fieldwork relations, this rhetor-\nical and seductive persuasion cannot but have impli-\ncations for Carrithers\u2019s argument. His call for public ac-\ncountability on the part of our political leaders is laud-\nable but must be infused with the awareness that these\nsame leaders order wiretaps at the United Nations and\nthe mistreatment of prisoners at Guanta\u00b4namo and Abu\nGhraib. Suspicion is not a surrender to Realpolitik but\nrather a recognition that ethnographers and citizens may\nbe led astray through deception, seduction, rhetoric, and\nmisinformation. Such ploys and strategies must first be\ndetected and unmasked before we can enter into genuine\nrelations of mutual trust and forbearance.\nneil roughley\nDepartment of Philosophy, Konstanz University, D-\n78457 Konstanz, Germany (neil.roughley@uni-\nkonstanz.de). 10 i 05\nCarrithers asserts that anthropology is a \u201cmoral sci-\nence\u201d\u2014in several different senses of the term \u201cmoral.\u201d\nI shall try to specify four of these senses and to recon-\nstruct the most plausible arguments for them. I have no\nquarrel with claims 1 and 2, am unqualified to assess 3,\nand reject 4.\n1. A first use that can be made of the expression \u201cmoral\n452 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nscience\u201d is as an archaic designation of one of the hu-\nmanities as distinguished from the natural sciences, a\nusage introduced by Mill in his Logic (1973[1843]:\n833\u2013954). In contrast to Mill but in agreement with\nSchu\u00a8tz and Winch (1964), Carrithers insists that the so-\ncial sciences are \u201cverstehende Wissenschaften,\u201d which\ncan provide genuine explanations only if the investigator\nlearns to apply the concepts in terms of which members\nof the society under investigation live their lives (\u201cen-\ngaged learning\u201d). Explanation is thus dependent on un-\nderstanding and will be bogus if it primarily seeks nom-\nological connections between macrostructural entities.\nMoreover, such structural conceptions tend to treat\nmembers of the societies studied as passive bearers of\nthe structures, neglecting the causal role of their active\nchoices. Here the term \u201cmoral\u201d isolates a particular sub-\nject matter and recommends a specific methodology for\nits study.\n2. The bearers of a culture are, Carrithers insists fur-\nther, not just \u201cagents\u201d and \u201cchoosers\u201d but loci of \u201cmoral\nagency\u201d and \u201cmoral choice.\u201d His point here seems to be\nto emphasize that the concepts in terms of which people\nlive their lives do not just pick out items of the world\u2019s\nfurniture but also involve prescriptions concerning what\nis to be done. A second sense of \u201cmoral science,\u201d then,\ndesignates the study of the normative and evaluative sys-\ntems, the \u201cmores\u201d of the societies under investigation.\nThis has consequences for the anthropologist\u2019s work. Be-\ncause evaluation involves adopting emotional stances to-\nwards whatever is evaluated, what the anthropologist\nhas to learn here is ways of being emotional. Engaged\nlearning is, at least in part, a matter of feeling with one\u2019s\ninformants.\n3. The next step appears to involve combining this idea\nwith a psychological fact about most normal human be-\nings: feeling with people tends to lead to feeling for them.\nWithin the anthropological enterprise, this mechanism\nis given a special cognitive framing. Here the shared emo-\ntional perspective results from the anthropologist\u2019s re-\npeatedly putting himself in the emotional shoes of his\ninformants. Carrithers describes how taking this step\nbrings home to the investigator with particular force the\ncontingency of his own deeply felt attachments, a kind\nof corporeal\u2014or \u201caesthetic\u201d\u2014underscoring of what is\notherwise a highly abstract belief. From this experience\nof oneself as another it is small cognitive step to the\nsense of others as potentially oneself. This \u201caestheti-\ncally\u201d underscored cognitive movement can in turn be\nseen as conferring an \u201cobjective\u201d status on the sympathy\nthat arises where shared emotional stances are adopted.\nSuch \u201cobjectified sympathy\u201d is a good candidate for the\nmechanism by means of which we attribute intrinsic\nworth to others. If this is right, then engaged learners\nwill tend to see their interlocutors as the bearers of in-\ntrinsic value. As a result, anthropological knowledge is\nacquired as a result of a process frequently characterized\nby an affirmative evaluative perspective on the objects\nof knowledge. It is this fact that allows Carrithers to\ndescribe anthropology as a \u201cmoral science\u201d in a third\nsense\u2014as a discipline whose methods can be separated\nonly with difficulty from the adoption of a positive moral\nor evaluative stance towards its objects.\n4. However, this notion of the \u201cmorally infused char-\nacter of anthropological knowledge\u201d does not take us to\nthe final sense in which, according to Carrithers, an-\nthropology is a \u201cmoral science.\u201d The discipline is\n\u201cmoral\u201d in this last, normative sense to the extent that\nit provides the basis for the moral criticism of human\nactions such as the Iraq war. Bush\u2019s rhetoric, Carrithers\ntells us, is to be condemned because it \u201ccontravened the\n. . . moral aesthetic of anthropology.\u201d This, I suspect,\nmeans more or less that it is appalling to a sensibility\ntrained in forms of interaction governed by sympathy\nand the knowledge of the contingency of one\u2019s own iden-\ntity. However, anthropological fieldwork provides no\nguarantee that what is felt by a sensibility thus schooled\nis normatively binding. There may well be cases in\nwhich what ought morally to be done meets with un-\njustified resistance from such sensibilities. I happen to\nagree with Carrither\u2019s judgement about Iraq, but for rea-\nsons that have little to do with anthropology: rigorous\nrequirements on the justification of any war, respect for\ninternational law, and the prudential norm that one\navoid aggravating problems one is supposed to be solving.\nPerhaps there are morally normative conditions for cog-\nnitively successful anthropology, but that would not\nmake the discipline itself normative.\nmarilyn strathern\nDepartment of Social Anthropology, Cambridge\nUniversity, Free School Lane, Cambridge, U.K.\n(ms10026@cam.ac.uk). 30 i 05\nI wish to draw out of this engaging piece a rather par-\nticular set of comments. These begin with what at one\nstage Carrithers refers to as holism, a principle of data\ncollecting (in fieldwork) that becomes a principle of ex-\nplanation (where items are set into wider contexts). Al-\nthough anthropologists continue to search for contexts\ninto which to put things, this is not often these days\nlabelled as part of the holistic enterprise, and, indeed, in\nthis very non-Dumontian sense the term is widely dis-\ncredited. It is discredited of course by the empirical\nmind-set that imagines that holism is about whole so-\ncieties. If holism were rewritten as a technique for ac-\ncessing the infinitely possible, we might be on more\ncomfortable ground and on ground that Carrithers has\ncleared for us.\nAs I see it, the axiom of holism that appears to be\nabout gathering everything in fact permits the field-\nworker to gather anything; conversely, rather than ful-\nfilling the promise about encompassing all the relations\nthat might be pertinent to an understanding of a society\nin some kind of totalized state, it achieves the apparently\nmore modest\u2014though in social science terms somewhat\nscandalous\u2014goal of allowing the analyst to pursue any\nconnection of interest. In the issues that Carrithers has\ngathered here, I see something of a similar movement.\nApproaches can hold out promises that no one is going\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 453\nto see realized but accomplish some very interesting re-\nsults. There is a sense, then, in which this science of\npossibilities (anthropology) develops not just from an\nopenness to its subject matter\u2014the axiom that every-\nthing could always be otherwise\u2014but from the manner\nin which work gets done. It often gets done despite the-\noretical inclinations and specific analytics; what happens\nis \u201cotherwise\u201d to initial or imagined intentions.\nWe might take Gellner\u2019s interpretive charity as a case\nin point. Interpretation points to interest in itself, in the\ncalibre of explanations, and asks whether new connec-\ntions can illuminate old ones. What is often produced in\nthe course of seeking explanation is other connections\u2014\nyet we worry about the explanations (is it the right con-\nnection?) rather than observe the (other) connections\nthat have come to the surface. That things link up is\noften in fact as much a puzzle as a solution, in the same\nway as it is not just the exception but the rule that re-\nquires interpretation\u2014not just social change but conti-\nnuity. And just to add to the uncertainty, when does an\ninterpretation become a moral stance? In Carrithers\u2019s\nown terms appreciation of diversity, for instance,\nemerges as a potential ingredient of a moral stance; why,\nthen, should we have to account for (interpret, explain)\nit?\nCarrithers ends on a sombre note. It was desperately\nimportant for us to be able to see otherwise in the la-\nbelling of terrorism and the relentless pursuit of weapons\nof mass destruction. But the trouble is that anyone can\nlocate other possibilities. They too may be pernicious.\nLeaving Bush aside, take the \u201cmoral certainty\u201d of Blair;\nit was barely credible even at the height of its enunci-\nation. Blair had no business referring to his own convic-\ntions. Many people allowed themselves to be led by his\nrhetoric because they assumed that the emotional con-\nviction must have behind it political judgement and in-\nside knowledge. In other words, an \u201cotherwise,\u201d a world\nof other possibilities, was assumed to lie behind the rhet-\noric. Blair might talk of his personal belief in weapons\nof mass destruction, but that surely hid the cool politi-\ncian and rational leader who had access to knowledge\nthat for security reasons he was prevented from sharing.\nHow wrong they\/we all were!\nThere are many issues to be illuminated from this\ncomplex account. In revisiting certain strands in the re-\ncent history of anthropology, the author has pertinently\nsuggested that anthropologists may have more resources\nwith which to construct a science of moral enquiry than\nthey had thought.\nnandini sundar\nDepartment of Sociology, Delhi School of Economics,\nDelhi University, Delhi 110007, India\n(nandinisundar@yahoo.com) 24 i 05\nCarrithers\u2019s elegantly written article is a pleasure to read:\ngently persuasive, leading one through the tensions of\ncultural relativism and moral engagement to arrive at a\ntentative but restful way of inhabiting a fractious world,\na way that recognizes the smallness of one\u2019s being yet\nfrontally challenges power. I particularly like the em-\nphasis on moral judgement as a product not of cultural\ngivens but of consciously constructed interactions, on\nan \u201cad hoc morality of mutual recognition,\u201d and on field-\nwork as \u201cengaged learning\u201d rather than \u201cparticipant\nobservation.\u201d\nCarrithers\u2019s notion of \u201cmoral agency-cum-patiency\u201d\nalso goes some way towards answering my own doubts\nabout the culpability of ordinary individuals in moments\nof collective or national madness\u2014of individual respon-\nsibility for national hubris. However, I wish he had dealt\nmore with the question of how moral agency is formed\u2014\nout of what elements of childhood, location, what con-\njunctures of \u201cpatiency\u201d or \u201cbeing done to.\u201d Are expla-\nnations for agency\u2014for example, resisting forced\nsterilization or acquiescing in and even promoting it\u2014\nmerely contingent, accidental, just part of the way the\nworld is, or is it possible to discern some pattern in\nthem?\nMy second concern is the discipline\u2019s ability to reach\nout to a larger audience. While Carrithers should easily\nconvince anthropologists, as well as anyone who believes\nin forbearance and the equal worth of all human beings,\nabout the resources provided by the discipline for a\ngrounded moral stand, it may have little effect on those\nwho are more certain of their own superior worth\u2014re-\nligious evangelists, white supremacists, oil barons (the\nlist seems to be expanding rather than contracting at the\nmoment). What resources do we have against this? More-\nover, in a world in which social sciences and universities\nare seen as liberal outposts and in which funding for\nresearch on subjects that do not serve empire is vastly\nreduced, it is the fate of anthropology itself that is of\nconcern. There seem to be even fewer chances that Pres-\nident George W. Bush or anyone else will take anthro-\npology and the moral perspective it offers seriously.\nMy last issue is a minor one: Carrithers\u2019s description\nof the International Declaration of Human Rights as a\n\u201ctime- and culture-bound artefact, an expression only of\nsome people\u2019s ideas at a particular time (North Atlantic\ndemocracies at the end of World War II).\u201d In posing the\ntension between the universality of this declaration and\nthe varieties of notions of personhood and rights, Car-\nrithers is ignoring his own understanding of (anthropo-\nlogical) moral judgement as arising \u201cin the interstices of\nthe globe . . . in a region that does not fall under any\nsingle cultural regime.\u201d The ideas embodied in the dec-\nlaration were products precisely of such interactions, of\nstruggles against colonialism and racism and for female\nsuffrage in which ideas and desires swirled across the\nglobe and the fight was waged both within and between\nnations. It is true that the final form of the declaration,\nwith its refusal to embody mechanisms for effective im-\nplementation (which the Soviet Union had wanted), was\nultimately that of the liberal, capitalist North, but the\nprehistory of these rights is that of the whole globe.\n454 F current anthropology Volume 46, Number 3, June 2005\nReply\nmichael carrithers\nDurham, U.K. 3 ii 05\nMany anthropologists have felt that if they could mag-\nically stand aside to let those studied speak for them-\nselves, clarity and justice would be better served. I cer-\ntainly feel something like that here. The comments of\nmy colleagues open further possibilities that I could not\nhave expected and so remind me how rich and various\nour voices, our experience, and our imaginations can be.\nStrecker advocates different moods and models for our\nanthropological imagination, not Musil\u2019s nostalgic irony\nbut the hard-boiled revolutionary insouciance of Brecht.\nAfter the failed uprising in 1953 in the German Demo-\ncratic Republic, the government distributed leaflets say-\ning that the people had forfeited the trust of the govern-\nment and would have to work twice as hard in future.\nIn his poem \u201cThe Solution\u201d (Die Lo\u00a8sung), Brecht pro-\nposed an answer to the problem: \u201cWouldn\u2019t it just be\neasier if the government dissolved the people and elected\nanother one?\u201d Such a model might serve us well in these\ntimes, perhaps to say something about offering freedom\nout of the barrel of a gun. William Beeman (2004, for\nexample) is using knowledge gained in the service of\nanthropology to write less aphoristically but with force\nand learned authority about American policy toward Iraq\nfor different publics in the United States, as Gordon\nrightly reminds us. For my part, I cannot write as a Mid-\ndle East expert or applied anthropologist, but I am happy\nthat matters of such weight can be called by name in\nthe forum of current anthropology for the imagined\ncommunity\u2014and I mean \u201cimagined\u201d in the most con-\ncrete sense\u2014of anthropologists across the world.\nFernandez writes of anthropology as a calling and finds\nits creed, or at least its aspiration, in an \u201copenness and\ngenerosity of spirit\u201d toward our coevals. I am sure he is\nright for many of us, and certainly for me. I also think\u2014\nand here I reply to Sundar\u2019s concern about the sources\nof moral agency\u2014that at least some sources can be found\nfor such a calling, just as they could be found for more\nheroic deeds and lives. In my case the example, when I\nwas a student, of the older students from my university\nwho had returned from the civil rights movement in the\nAmerican South must have contributed, and I dimly dis-\ncern that even childhood church attendance may have\nplayed a part. Sundar will have very different sources for\nher sense of anthropology\u2019s worth. Her welcome correc-\ntion of my too wholehearted scepticism about the Uni-\nversal Declaration of Human Rights suggests that some\nof her sources might reside in part in India\u2019s independ-\nence struggle and the struggle of women there to find a\nvoice. Her reply suggests, too, that the Universal Dec-\nlaration, for all its faults, is still pretty close to being\npart of the anthropologist\u2019s creed as well. But in any case,\nsources are just sources, stories and experiences whose\nimport must still be actively teased out and applied (as\nBrenneis observes).\nIt would probably be healthy to accept that the notion\nof a calling can only take us so far. I have met with\ndisarming scepticism from students about the actual im-\nportance of anthropology\u2019s mission to inform the world\nabout human diversity-in-coevalness. And I have over-\nheard weary remarks from colleagues in other social sci-\nences about the moral fervor of anthropologists who act\nless as missionaries to the natives than as missionaries\nfrom the natives. Something of this scepticism informs\nRoughley\u2019s reply. He makes the point nicely that an-\nthropologists \u201clearn [other] ways of being emotional,\u201d\nand he finds some philosophical cogency in the essay\u2019s\nargument, at least as far as the last movement. There,\nhowever, he observes that anthropology cannot be a\nmoral science in the sense that its conclusions are \u201cnor-\nmatively binding,\u201d by which I think he must mean ra-\ntionally founded and universally applicable.\nHe must be right in this criticism. Anthropology is so\nradically empirical a subject that the notion of \u201cnor-\nmatively binding\u201d would only lead an anthropologist to\nfurther questions\u2014binding on whom? by whose author-\nity? when? in what social circumstances?\u2014and those\nquestions would leave any implied universality in tat-\nters. If the \u201cscience\u201d in \u201cmoral science\u201d means certainty,\nthen anthropology is not a science. But if \u201cscience\u201d refers\nto a schooled sensibility and a commitment to the idea\nthat the human world is not explicable without sus-\ntained investigation, then we are at least as much a moral\nscience as any of the others, such as sociology or political\nscience, that once went under that title in the University\nof Cambridge.\nMuch in the essay and in the comments turns upon\nthe relationship between anthropologist and host. Fox\ntwists this topic in a surprising direction, showing how\nthoroughly reciprocal the existential plight of the two\ncan be. Or the tables may be turned: he had at least\nprepared himself for fieldwork among the Rotinese, but\nthey had to adapt to him unexpectedly. If he had doubts,\nthey had more. And if Fox expanded our sense of pos-\nsibilities through the anthropological imagination, he\nalso found himself expanding theirs. We had perhaps not\nthought it worked that way, but on this evidence it works\nvery well.\nRobben takes us in another surprising but far more\nsombre direction. He is right to say that my image of\nfieldwork is benign, even romantic. In most of my field-\nwork, in Fox\u2019s, and in some of Robben\u2019s, the creed rep-\nresented roughly in the Universal Declaration and the\nmoral practicalities of everyday fieldwork\u2014the polite-\nness, if you will\u2014eventually harmonize. In interviewing\na torturer, in contrast, the creed and the politeness are\ndeeply at odds. Robben says that he regards this \u201clack of\nsincerity not as unethical but as an acceptable practice\nin the study of political violence.\u201d I can agree, but I am\nstill troubled and concerned to know why I agree. One\ndirect answer is this: in a conflict between the contingent\nmorality of a personal encounter and the more general-\nizing creed of human rights, human rights must take\ncarrithers Anthropology as a Moral Science of Possibilities F 455\nprecedence. But there is a subtler answer as well. Robben\nwrites of the \u201cimplicit knowledge\u201d of such violations\nand notes that the conversation moves seductively\naround that knowledge. Here the main consideration is\njust this, that the knowledge that people were tortured\nand killed and that such acts would be condemned is\npresent, active, and shared. It is the elephant in the cor-\nner of the room that no one mentions but of which both\nparties cannot but be aware. Here we can learn some-\nthing from the 1942 Wannsee Conference, where Nazi\nadministrators decided on the Final Solution. It might\nseem peculiar that, in such homogeneous company in a\ncountry that had been \u201cnormalized\u201d (gleichgeschaltet)\nto Nazi beliefs and practices, such a plan should have\nbeen kept secret. Why, amidst apparently total ideolog-\nical and physical hegemony, should the world not have\nbeen allowed to know? Yet it was kept secret, and it was\nsuggested to the participants that their supposed heroism\nin undertaking these measures would be the more heroic\nfor remaining forever secret. So there, too, was the\nknowledge of the enormity of the plan and of the more\ngeneral condemnation it would meet: the elephant in the\ncorner of the room. If we were to ask after the \u201cinformed\nconsent\u201d for Robben to use his interviews in public, then\nwe would have to say that the information was there\nthroughout the interview and the consent to use it was\ndemonstrated in the very fact of the interview. Robben\ncould not compel anyone to speak, but people did.\nRamos asks a deep and challenging question. He first\npoints out that the essay seems to replace the concept\nof cultural relativism with that of irony and that both\nconcepts concern differences of viewpoint across the\nsame topic. What, then, is the difference between the\ntwo concepts in orienting the anthropologist\u2019s judge-\nment, whether moral, ethical, or political? Let me try in\nvery brief compass to say why irony is by far the more\nmuscular idea. The first step is to follow Friedrich (2001)\nin accepting that irony enters into the flow of everyone\u2019s\nexperience at the very source, the temporal stream of\nevents. Any moment in a developing situation or any\nmoment of interpretation of a situation becomes subject\nto further reinterpretation in the following flow of\nthought, dialogue, and events themselves. \u201cAll . . . in-\nstances,\u201d writes Friedrich, \u201cgiven the dialogic situation\nof all communication, involve some slippage or lack of\nfit between the intended meaning and what was under-\nstood, between what was anticipated and what actually\nhappened\u201d (2001:238). One could also note that human\nbeings are \u201cbeings of fantasy,\u201d as Heidegren reminds us,\nand that such fantasy plays continually in the mind and\noften across the lips in the flow of everyday life. On this\nvery radical and noticeably Buddhist view, everything is\nalways subject to irony\u2014and to comedy, if we take it\nthat comedy can also include very sombre material, as\nFriedrich observes.\nThe next step is to note an opposition between irony\nand seriousness (Bohrer 2000). If unruly, fractious, and\ncomedic irony bubbles up constantly, then there are\nmany reasons to value seriousness: to maintain an in-\ntention or plan across events, to maintain a constant and\nconsoling interpretation of events, or to maintain power\nover events and people. Hence the apparatus of culture\u2014\nthe rhetorical means to concentrate the attention of oth-\ners on the matter at (one\u2019s) hand\u2014and of social organi-\nzation. \u201cYou have to summon up social institutions if\nyou want to make serious communication possible. No\none will doubt that before the court, at the doctor\u2019s, in\nan academic seminar, at the church, in the classroom,\nor in commercial dealings, communication is serious\u201d\n(Baeker 2000:390, my translation). (And remember that\nurge to giggle during a dressing down by the teacher:\nhuman nature versus the machine!)\nTo drive the simile further: human beings have in-\nvented many kinds of seriousness machines to keep\nevents and interpretations on track. On an earlier view,\nanthropologists were to be experts on the seriousness\nmachines alone and tried to ignore the constantly up-\nwelling irony. Now\u2014at least if one accepts this sketch\u2014\nwe must track both the machines and the ironic com-\nmentary they attempt to control. There is no prescription\nfor where this sensibility will lead, but a sensitive nose,\nsuch as that of Eric Wolf or Ramos himself, will soon\nsniff out the hot iron of a grinding ideology. Sometimes\neven the money fed to a seriousness machine, such as\nBush\u2019s second inauguration, may gain enough mass to\nemit a distinct odour of its own, an odour of unease in\nthe face of ironically expanding events.\nBrenneis and Strathern throw a slightly different light\non the matter: anthropologists are masters\/mistresses of\nthe connection, of the analogy, of the slippage\u2014and, I\nwould add, of the links between parts of the seriousness\nmachine and between the seriousness machine and the\nrush of events and interpretations. Strathern refreshes us\nwith a reinterpretation of holism in anthropology, and I\nthink we must now follow her in recognizing that holism\nrefers not to some imagined societal whole but to the\nimagined whole (and actual infinity) of connections be-\ntween one matter under scrutiny and another. It is true,\nas Brenneis remarks, that such connections are rarely\nneutral but tend at first to follow our moral compass.\nBut, as they both observe, there is such a radical com-\nmitment to empiricism in anthropology that we are\nbound to follow connections well beyond our expecta-\ntions and prior inclinations. This is what makes anthro-\npology so exciting to its practitioners, so rich in its dis-\ncovery of new perspectives and new moral sensibilities,\nand so adaptable and reassuring a seriousness machine.\nReferences Cited\na d o r n o , t h e o d o r . 2001 (1951).
