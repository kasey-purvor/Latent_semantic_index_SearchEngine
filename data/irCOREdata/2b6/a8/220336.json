Integrated control programmes aimed at tackling these debilitating NTDs have been recently initiated, mainly using preventative chemotherapy. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of these integrated programs presents particular challenges over and above those required for single disease vertical programmes. We used baseline data from the National NTD Control Programme in Burkina Faso in order to assess the feasibility of an integrated survey design, as well as to elucidate the contribution of environmental variables to the risk of either Schistosoma haematobium, trachoma, or both among school-aged children. Methods: S. haematobium infection was diagnosed by detecting eggs in urine. A trachoma case was defined by the presence of Trachomatous inflammation-Follicular (TF) and\/or Trachomatous inflammation-Intense (TI) in either eye. Baseline data collected from 3,324 children aged 7-11 years in 21 sentinel sites across 11 regions of Burkina Faso were analyzed using simple and multivariable hierarchical binomial logistic regression models fitted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation methods. Probabilities of the risk of belonging to each infection\/disease category were estimated as a function of age, gender (individual level), and environmental variables (at sentinel site level, interpolated from national meteorological stations). Results: Overall prevalence at the sentinel sites was 11.79% (95% CI: 10.70-12.89) for S. haematobium; 13.30% (12.14-14.45) for trachoma and 0.84 % (0.53-1.15) for co-infections. The only significant predictor of S. haematobium infection was altitude. There were significant negative associations between the prevalence of active trachoma signs and minimum temperature, and air pressure. Conditional upon these predictors, these data are consistent with the two pathogens being independent.

Integrated control programmes aimed at tackling these debilitating NTDs have been recently initiated, mainly using preventative chemotherapy. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of these integrated programs presents particular challenges over and above those required for single disease vertical programmes. We used baseline data from the National NTD Control Programme in Burkina Faso in order to assess the feasibility of an integrated survey design, as well as to elucidate the contribution of environmental variables to the risk of either Schistosoma haematobium, trachoma, or both among school-aged children. Methods: S. haematobium infection was diagnosed by detecting eggs in urine. A trachoma case was defined by the presence of Trachomatous inflammation-Follicular (TF) and\/or Trachomatous inflammation-Intense (TI) in either eye. Baseline data collected from 3,324 children aged 7-11 years in 21 sentinel sites across 11 regions of Burkina Faso were analyzed using simple and multivariable hierarchical binomial logistic regression models fitted by Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation methods. Probabilities of the risk of belonging to each infection\/disease category were estimated as a function of age, gender (individual level), and environmental variables (at sentinel site level, interpolated from national meteorological stations). Results: Overall prevalence at the sentinel sites was 11.79% (95% CI: 10.70-12.89) for S. haematobium; 13.30% (12.14-14.45) for trachoma and 0.84 % (0.53-1.15) for co-infections. The only significant predictor of S. haematobium infection was altitude. There were significant negative associations between the prevalence of active trachoma signs and minimum temperature, and air pressure. Conditional upon these predictors, these data are consistent with the two pathogens being independent. Conclusions: Urogenital schistosomiasis and trachoma constitute public health problems in Burkina Faso. Sentinel site (at school level) surveys for these two NTDs can be implemented simultaneously. However, to support MDA treatment decisions in Burkina Faso, the protocol used in this study would only be applicable to hypoendemic trachoma areas.

The only significant predictor of S. haematobium infection was altitude. There were significant \nnegative associations between the prevalence of active trachoma signs and minimum temperature, and air \npressure. Conditional upon these predictors, these data are consistent with the two pathogens being \nindependent. Conclusions: Urogenital schistosomiasis and trachoma constitute public health problems in \nBurkina Faso. Sentinel site (at school level) surveys for these two NTDs can be implemented \nsimultaneously. However, to support MDA treatment decisions in Burkina Faso, the protocol used in this \nstudy would only be applicable to hypoendemic trachoma areas. More research is needed to confirm if \nthese findings can be generalized to West Africa and beyond. \n \n \n 3\nBackground \n \nSchistosomiasis and trachoma are among the most prevalent of the so-called \"Neglected Tropical \nDiseases (NTDs)\", an umbrella term that encompasses a group of parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections \ncollectively imposing a similar disease burden to that of malaria and HIV [1, 2]. NTDs are widespread in \nsub-Saharan Africa [3], where they affect more than 500 million people [1]. These NTDs are both the \nresult of, and a major contributor to the poverty of many rural and some disadvantaged urban populations \nin tropical regions of the world [4]. However, the fact that some NTDs are treatable with affordable (or \ndonated), safe and effective drugs has encouraged the implementation of \u2018preventative\u2019 chemotherapy \ncontrol programs. Although these drugs do not prevent such infections, they help prevent or minimize the \nburden of disease that would ensue if left untreated.  \n \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 206 million people are infected with \nparasites of the genus Schistosoma (of whom 120 million have symptoms and around 20 million show \nsevere disease sequelae) [5]. Schistosomiasis is an indirectly (snail)-transmitted disease whose \ndistribution is particularly sensitive to environmental changes, including changes of human origin. \nTransmission of the parasite is highly focal, with heterogeneity reflecting numerous human and snail host \nas well as environmental factors [6]. Identifying the broad scale patterns of schistosomiasis is crucial \nbecause ecological and climatic changes plus human migration may have led to changes in the prevalence \nand distribution of the disease in different parts of endemic countries [7]. The current mainstay for \nschistosomiasis control is to mitigate against the burden of the disease by controlling morbidity through \nchemotherapy with praziquantel (PZQ). It is recommended that mass drug administration (MDA) with \nPZQ be delivered to total at-risk populations defined where a survey shows prevalence of over 50% in \nschool-aged children and to children aged 6\u201316 years where survey prevalence is between 10% and 50% \nin this group [8]. (Although the indicator group for schistosomiasis comprises school-aged children, pre-\nschool-aged children can also be infected, the implications of which are considered below). Because \nschistosomiasis exhibits strong spatial heterogeneity at local levels, there is a need to identify and locate \nhigh-risk communities or schools that require MDA [7] so that cost-effective management of limited \nresources can be achieved.  \n \nTrachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide [9]. Around 80 million people have \nactive trachoma, an inflammatory early stage of the disease caused by recent infection with the ocular \nbacteria Chlamydia trachomatis, with the young children bearing the heaviest burden [10]. Repeat \ninfection leads to scarring of the eyelid, which causes the eyelids to turn inwards and subsequently cause \nthe eyelashes to scratch the cornea, ultimately leading to blindness (WHO estimates that 6 million people \n 4\nglobally are blind from trachoma). The WHO endorses a four-pronged approach to eliminate blinding \ntrachoma by the year 2020 known as SAFE: Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotic against infection, Facial \ncleanliness, and Environmental sanitation [11]. Currently, Pfizer Inc. donates millions of doses of the \nantibiotic azithromycin (Zithromax, ZTX) for trachoma control. MDA with ZTX or tetracycline eye \nointment is at present recommended for entire endemic communities to be conducted annually for three \nyears wherever the prevalence of active trachoma in children of ages 1\u20139 years old at the district level is \nabove 10% [11]. Trachoma is associated with individual and environmental risk factors as well as \nclimatic conditions which may be important determinants of trachoma transmission (which in some cases \ncan occur mechanically through flies) [12-15]. These may vary between settings and hence the need for \nstudies aimed to identify risk factors relevant to specific environments. Indeed, understanding risk factors \nis essential in designing appropriate interventions for the \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018E\u2019 components of the SAFE strategy \n(e.g. water availability for Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvements) [16].  \n \nBased on the argument of co-endemicity of NTDs within countries [17], global advocacy for the \namelioration or elimination of the disease burden imposed by these conditions has recently increased, \nwith a renewed interest in the scaling-up of integrated NTD interventions in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly \nusing preventative chemotherapy distributed through MDA [18]. More particularly, MDA is a relatively \nefficacious tool to control the infection and morbidity caused by the helminthiases and trachoma and such \nan approach offers opportunities for integration. There is also an interest in trying to deliver some of \ntreatments through school-based programmes, and again schistosomiasis and trachoma lend themselves to \nthis approach as the burden of infection is mostly concentrated among the young.  \n \nAn important question in integrated NTD control relates to the spatial scale at which the programs should \nbe integrated. This will depend on the geographical distribution and prevalence of both single and co-\ninfections. Therefore, the principal aim of the current study was to identify whether combined survey \ndesigns based on sentinel sites are useful monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tools for the assessment of \nintegrated schistosomiasis and active trachoma control programmes. A secondary aim was to establish the \ndistribution of these two NTDs in these selected sentinel sites within Burkina Faso pre- and post-\ntreatment (post-treatment data are not presented here). Finally, a post hoc analysis studied associations of \nurogenital schistosomiasis infection and active trachoma disease with demographic and environmental \nvariables; such results should  inform the construction of reliable disease maps [19] and mathematical \nmodeling efforts of these two NTDs. In addition, these results should help highlight potential factors \nrelated to the physiology and behavior of mechanical vectors of these two NTDs which ultimately could \ninform policies aimed at reducing transmission of these diseases. \n 5\n \nMethods \n \nEnvironmental conditions, control programme, sentinel sites and sampling \n \nIn September 2006, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the NTD \nControl Program, the first global effort to support country programs to integrate and scale-up delivery of \npreventative chemotherapy for five targeted NTDs: schistosomiasis, trachoma, lymphatic filariasis (LF), \nonchocerciasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STHs). Burkina Faso, a landlocked country in West \nAfrica, is endemic for all these five NTDs [20] and thus it was selected as one of the first five country \nprograms for implementation of integrated NTD control. The, environmental factors that influence \ndisease transmission are unlikely to be uniform over large geographical areas [21]. Consequently, when \ndesigning integrated control programs, it is essential to know the distribution and abundance of the target \ndiseases, to enable optimizing both the targeting of suitable interventions and the use of available \nresources [22]. Currently, however, there is little evidence on the feasibility of integrated survey designs \n[23].  \n \nBurkina Faso has a tropical climate with two very distinct seasons: the rainy season with between 600 and \n900 mm of rainfall, and the dry season during which the Harmattan, a hot dry wind from the Sahara, \nblows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May\/June to September, and is shorter in the \nnorthern part of the country. Four large agro-climatic regions can be defined, characterized by a strong \nsouth\u2013north decreasing gradient of average annual rainfall. The Sahel in the north receives less than 500 \nmm rainfall a year and exhibits high temperatures [24].  \n \nAlthough initially control programmes for schistosomiasis, trachoma, LF, onchocerciasis and the STHs \noperated autonomously, the Burkina Faso NTD Control Program has recently taken a phased approach to \nintegrated MDA. For instance, Burkina Faso was under the umbrella of the Onchocerciasis Control \nProgramme in West Africa until 2002 and community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) is the \nmainstay of control in areas where the infection was not eliminated. For the case of schistosomiasis and \ntrachoma, in 2007 drugs were distributed for these two infections and STHs as an integrated package in \nthree target districts (Tenkodogo, Koupela and Bogand\u00e9) and in 2008 these efforts were scaled up to \ninclude the LF and onchocerciasis programmes  as a platform for becoming a fully integrated MDA \ncampaign on a national level. At the time these surveys were planned, integrated assessments of \n 6\nschistosomiasis and trachoma as well as their co-infections using sentinel sites were made the main focus \nof these efforts. \n \nIn the current study we used baseline data (collected during November 2007 and February 2008 from 21 \nsentinel sites across 11 regions of the country) from longitudinal surveys which aimed also to contribute \nto the assessment of the impact on schistosomiasis and trachoma disease burden of the integrated NTD \ncontrol programme in Burkina after MDA (i.e. once the follow-up data would be collected a year later). \nWe will present the analyses of the follow-up studies elsewhere. \n \nSentinel sites were schools which were chosen based on a list which encompassed villages to be endemic \nfor onchocerciasis under the surveillance of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC). \nAmong these villages, those which were also endemic for LF and schistosomiasis (based on national \nhistorical data at the time) were selected randomly. Then, once at the sentinel site, the method for \nselecting school children in each of the ages of the 7-11 years olds, was random sampling. An M&E \nmeeting between the National Coordinators and Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) staff preceded \nthese surveys in February 2007 in Ouagadougou in order to decide on the cohort design and sampling. \n \nA fixed cohort was recruited at each sentinel site to allow comparisons to be made across sentinel sites \nand regions. Required sample sizes were calculated using the EpiSchisto software tool \n(http:\/\/www.schoolsandhealth.org\/epidynamics.htm) based on an expected reduction in mean infection \nintensity of 40% (for S. haematobium) following chemotherapy to achieve 80% statistical power and a \nsignificance level of 5%. The value of 40% was chosen as a conservative estimate of the expected \nreduction over a two-year period (two annual PZQ treatments-see Additional file 1, section S1, Figures \nS1A and S1B,  for further details concerning sample size calculations). A cluster random sampling design \nwas not considered appropriate here (despite the fact that this is the most reliable survey method for \ntrachoma prevalence estimation) as one of the purposes of this study was to utilize an integrated method \n[25]. Detailed statistical information has been provided in previous studies [20, 26].  All children enrolled \nin the study were interviewed by appropriately trained personnel at the Ministry of Health, Burkina Faso, \nafter parental consent was acquired. Administrative and religious authorities, among others, were all \ninvolved in these surveys in order to facilitate the implementation in the field. Ethical clearance was \nobtained from the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health and Imperial College London. \n \nIndicators for urogenital schistosomiasis \n \n 7\nExperienced technicians from the National Vertical Schistosomiasis Control Programme (NVSCP) \ncollected from the children one urine specimen to determine the prevalence and intensity of S. \nhaematobium infection by the filtration method. The intensity of S. haematobium infection was expressed \nas the number of eggs per 10 mL of urine. \n \nIndicators for active trachoma \n \nClinical signs of active trachoma, namely, trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) and trachomatous \ninflammation-intense (TI), were graded for each eye separately by two ophthalmologists and an \nophthalmic  nurse according to the WHO simplified grading system [27]. Standardization of the grading \nby the examiners and thus reliability tests were not performed during the baseline surveys but they did \nhappen before the follow-up studies. In this study, active trachoma was taken to indicate trachoma signs, \nand was defined as the presence of either of these signs (TF, TI) in either eye. All children with evidence \nof active trachoma were treated according to national guidelines and advice was then given on face \nwashing. The nurse cleaned his\/her hands with alcohol and the examiner changed gloves after examining \nthe eyes of each child.  \n \nInterpolation of environmental data, exploratory and statistical analysis \n \nEnvironmental information from all nine meteorological stations in Burkina Faso were obtained on a \ndaily basis for 2000 to 2008 for the following variables: altitude (in meters above sea level - MSL), \nprecipitation (in millimeters - mm), minimum, maximum, and average temperature (in degrees Celsius-\n\u25cbC) as well as air pressure (in millibars- mbars) from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) website \n(http:\/\/www7.ncdc.noaa.gov\/CDO\/cdoselect.cmd?datasetabbv=GSOD&countryabbv=&georegionabbv=). \nSuch variables were selected based on their potential biological relevance to the intermediate hosts of \nschistosomiasis and the mechanical (fly) vectors of trachoma. The average values over these years for \neach of these environmental variables at each meteorological station were then calculated. Similar data \nwere not available for the twenty one sentinel sites of this study individually but their geographical \npositions were recorded using Garmin\u00ae GPS devices.  \n \nInverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation was employed to estimate such variables for the sentinel \nsites, by using a weighted sum of the values of the nine known points for each environmental variable. \nMore precisely, IDW assigned weights to sample points (i.e. sentinel sites), which are proportional to the \ninverse distance squared that the particular school sentinel site is separated from the point of estimation \n 8\n(i.e. the meteorological station). The equation for the inverse squared distance weighted interpolation \nused, is as follows: \n\u2211\n\u2211\n=\n=\n= 9\n1\n2\n9\n1\n2\n1\n1\n\u02c6\ni i\ni\ni\ni\nd\nu\nd\nu\n \nwhere di is the distance between the sentinel school site and weather station i. The ui term is the average \nvalues of environmental variables as calculated for meteorological station i. This approach makes use of \nthe spatial autocorrelation in the environmental data because only points relatively close to the point of \nestimation will affect the prediction.  \n \nExploratory analyses were undertaken to explore the structure of the datasets: Firstly, Pearson correlations \nwere calculated for the average values of the environmental variables at each meteorological station \n(Additional file 1, section S2, Table S1). Secondly, Pearson correlations between the school-level \nprevalences of single and dual infections with the interpolated environmental variables were calculated \n(Additional file 1,,, section S2,,Table S2). Thirdly, scatter plots were produced to examine relationships \nbetween school-level prevalences of single and dual infections with the interpolated environmental \nvariables (Additional file 1, section S3). Finally, summary statistics were generated for the environmental \nvariables (Table 1). \n \nFor the modeling of the relationship between the S. haematobium prevalence and the interpolated \nenvironmental variables, binomial logistic regression models were used. Similar models were applied in \norder to examine the relationship between active trachoma prevalence and the interpolated environmental \nvariables. Potential confounding effects (age and gender) were adjusted for in all logistic regression \nmodels. A problem in developing models using environmental variables is that many such variables are \nhighly inter-correlated making it difficult to separate the effects of the independent variables statistically \n[28]. To reduce the dimensionality of these collinear variables, firstly we selected those variables likely to \nhave greater biological significance on infection transmission [29]. To take into account the nested \nstructure of our data we fitted hierarchical models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation \nmethods, including schools as random effects. Children within each school as well as the results from \ndifferent schools were treated as \u2018exchangeable\u2019 in the sense that each pair of children within a school \nwere equally correlated [30]. We used the MLwiN v 2.21 default setting which specify diffuse prior \ndistributions (fixed parameters 1)( \u221d\u03b2p and scalar variances )1( 2\u03c3\np ~ )001.0,001.0(\u0393 ) and which \n 9\napproximate maximum likelihood estimates. The additional variables were included in the models \nfollowing a backward stepwise elimination procedure, comparing the deviance information criterion \n(DIC) at each stage [31] . We considered as potential explanatory variables the interpolated values of \naltitude, precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, average temperature, and air \npressure at all sentinel sites and we calculated 95 % credible intervals (i.e. intervals derived from 2.5 % \nand 97.5 % quantiles of the chains of parameter estimates). Odds ratios from all these models were \nreported relating to differences comparable to rounded standard deviations of the interpolated \nenvironmental variables (see Table 2) to make the results more readily interpretable. \n  \nFinally, we used the map-making facility available at www.spatialepidemiology.net, which utilizes \nGoogle Maps [32], in order to display the NCDC weather stations and sentinel sites visited during the \nM&E surveys in Burkina Faso. We also used this tool to display the observed S. haematobium and active \ntrachoma prevalence and treatment strategy, as well as the need for intervention with the SAFE strategy, \nbased on WHO-recommended implementation thresholds [33]. It should be noted, however, that although \nfor trachoma these thresholds were established based on prevalence of clinical signs of disease in children \n1-9 years of age, the observation that the prevalence in school-aged children is greater than 10 % probably \nmeans that this prevalence is even greater in the younger age groups, warranting treatment.  \n \nResults \n \nA total of 3,324 children aged 7 to 11 years were surveyed from the 21 sentinel sites (Figure 1). Observed \nprevalence values by sentinel site of single and dual S. haematobium and trachoma signs are illustrated in \nTable 2. \n \nFigure 2 illustrates MDA recommendations for S. haematobium and trachoma signs for the 21 sentinel \nsites from observed data on the prevalence of the two diseases. Our data suggest that in only two sentinel \nsites would both PZQ and ZTX be required. In addition, Figure 2 shows that to the north (i.e. in the driest \nareas) of Burkina Faso the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was between 10% and 49% (i.e. \nmedium) but that of trachoma was less than 10% (i.e. low).  \n \nTable 2 contains summary statistics for the interpolated and meteorological station-based values of the \nenvironmental variables. For instance, for altitude, minimum (min) and maximum (max) values were \n259.0 and 440.8 MSL respectively; for precipitation, min and max values were 1.53 and 2.98 mm; for \n 10\nmax temperature, min and max values were 34.0 and 37.3 \u25cbC: for min temperature, min and max values \nwere 21.8 and 23.3 \u25cbC; for average temperature, min and max values were 27.5 and 29.5 \u25cbC and finally \nfor air pressure, min and max values were 961.0 and 978.5 mbars. The distributions of the interpolated \nvalues appear to be similar to the distributions of the original station-based data. \n \nTable 3 contains the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% credible intervals (95 % CrI) of the significant \nenvironmental variables for the risk of S. haematobium infection as being estimated from the simple and \nmultivariable hierarchical logistic regression models. According to simple hierarchical logistic regression \nmodelling, the risk of S. haematobium infection was significantly increased for higher temperatures \n(minimum, maximum and average); higher air pressure; lower altitude; and lower precipitation. Such \nassociations were also noticeable in the scatter plots (Additional file 1, section S3). A multivariable \nhierarchical logistic regression model was then fitted (without including maximum and average \ntemperatures due to collinearity with minimum temperature). The risk of S. haematobium infection was \nindicated to be only negatively and significantly associated with altitude; a 50 MSL increase in altitude \nwould decrease the odds of S. haematobium infection by 99.8 %.  \n \nTable 4 contains the ORs and 95% CrI of the significant environmental variables for the risk of trachoma \nsigns as being estimated from the simple and multivariable hierarchical logistic regression models. Simple \nhierarchical logistic regression models indicated (perhaps counter-intuitively) an increased risk of \ntrachoma signs at higher altitudes and greater precipitation, and a decreased risk of trachoma signs at \nhigher temperatures (minimum, maximum, and average), and air pressure. On inspection of the scatter \nplots of active trachoma prevalence by the environmental variables, such associations were noticeable \n(Additional file 1, section S3). Similarly as before, maximum and average temperatures were excluded \nfrom the multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model building due to collinearity with minimum \ntemperature. On multivariable analysis, the risk of trachoma signs remained decreased at higher minimum \ntemperature and higher air pressure. Altitude and precipitation were finally removed from the final \nmultivariable hierarchical logistic regression on the inspection of credible intervals and the DIC, through \nthe backward elimination method. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThrough sentinel site surveillance defined at the school level, this study showed that urogenital \nschistosomiasis and trachoma surveys can be successfully implemented simultaneously. In addition, the \nprevalence of schistosomiasis infection and trachoma signs in these sentinel sites before integrated \n 11\ntreatment in Burkina Faso was estimated. Results indicated that both of these diseases are prevalent in the \ncountry and they likely do constitute public health problems according to WHO recommended thresholds \n[15, 20, 34-36]. Hierarchical binomial logistic regressions identified, as may be predicted, these diseases \nto be independent (conditional on environmental factors), which further highlight the different \nmechanisms of their transmission. Treatment with both PZQ (for urogenital schistosomiasis) and ZTX \n(for trachoma) was only required, however, for two of the 21 sentinel sites surveyed here.  \n \nWe chose sentinel site surveillance conducted in schools because in the case of schistosomiasis the \nselected methodology is ideal for the following reasons  [37]: (i) schools are accessible and receptive; (ii) \nthe highest prevalence levels of S. haematobium infection are found among school-age children; (iii) data \ncollected in this age range may be used to evaluate not only if schistosomiasis threatens the health of \nschool-aged children, but also if there is need for intervention in the community as a whole; (iv) children \nin intermediate grades (generally between ages 9\u201312) allow for the accompaniment of treatment impact \nover one to two years, before they leave school. In addition, we chose to recruit a longitudinal cohort of 7-\n11 years old at baseline for both logistical reasons (through integrating with the ongoing surveys) and as \nthis would enable us to follow-up these same children during three years.  Furthermore, our past \nexperience with SCI data has demonstrated that morbidity is also detectable in young school-aged \nchildren, which suggests that children may become infected early in life [20, 38, 39]. As we were \ninterested ultimately to monitor changes in the infection and to quantify the rate at which infections \nchange, we suspect that changes in morbidity in the younger age groups of school children would be more \nsensitive to changes in the force of infection (i.e. per capita rate at which a host acquires new infections) \nby MDA. However, we recognize that if we had also included data from the even younger age groups (i.e. \npre- school children) who did not receive schistosomiasis treatment in the monitoring programme, our \nunderstanding of the secular changes in transmission caused by a morbidity control programme could be \nimproved, helping also differentiate between the impact of PZQ on the individual and the community \n[40].   \n \nSchool-based surveys might underestimate the prevalence of trachoma in the community as a whole and \nthey certainly do not determine the priority for surgical intervention [25]. In addition, a key feature of \ntrachoma epidemiology is that of the age-profile of infection prevalence, which increases to a peak at very \nyoung ages and declines at older ages (particularly in heavily infected communities). This feature would \nnot be captured in study designs such as that used in the present study [16, 41-43]. Trachoma \ninterventions using WHO thresholds were established for a different age group than the one analyzed here \nand thus we are aware that inference on this matter should be treated with some caution. Nevertheless, as \n 12\nthe distribution of infection and disease will vary according to endemicity levels, the protocol applied in \nthis study could be of use to hypoendemic trachoma areas of Burkina Faso if MDA treatment decisions \nhave to be made based on results arising from similar study designs but not for planning where SAFE \nimplementation is needed as this is based on district-level prevalence of TF among the preferred 1-9 year \nage group. We draw this conclusion because it has been observed in hypo- and meso-endemic trachoma \nareas the infection prevalence data come to a peak in ages slightly greater than 5 years  [41]. \n \nIn this school-based approach a significant proportion of the school-aged children may not attend school \nand so the practicality of this approach may be limited to areas where school attendance is not too low. In \nBurkina Faso the percentage of attendance for the primary schools (children aged 7-13 years old) is \napproximately 63% and thus we might have missed a significant proportion of S. haematobium infection \nand trachoma signs. Moreover, observer error might have compromised the sensitivity and specificity of \nclinical diagnosis, although the magnitude of this effect is likely to be smaller [44].  \n \nEnvironmental effects on the emergence and re-emergence of pathogens are well recognized and thus a \nsecondary aim of this study was to characterize quantitatively the effect of specific environmental factors \nin addition to demographic factors on the two NTDs of interest here: urogenital schistosomiasis and \ntrachoma.  \n \nAltitude, precipitation, temperature and air pressure were all important predictors of S. haematobium \ninfection (Table 3) by simple hierarchical logistic regression modelling. Temperature and rainfall were \nimportant predictors of prevalence of S. haematobium infection also in Tanzania [45] and such statistical \nrelationships are consistent with the known biology of freshwater snails, the intermediate hosts for \nschistosomes. S. haematobium is transmitted by snails from the genus Bulinus. In Burkina Faso \nB. truncatus and B. senegalensis occur in all endemic schistosomiasis areas of the country [35, 46] and \ntheir dynamics are known to be sensitive to temperature and rainfall [29]. However, multivariable \nanalysis indicated only altitude to be negatively significantly associated with prevalence of S. \nhaematobium infection. \n \nThere were significant negative associations of prevalence of trachoma signs with minimum temperature \nand air pressure (Table 4). The significant negative association between minimum temperature as well as \nair pressure and trachoma signs in our study, strengthens the argument that environmental factors, and \nparticularly climatic conditions, may be important determinants of the physiology and behavior of Musca \nsorbens, a mechanical vector of trachoma in some settings [10, 13, 15]. Even if these are speculative, the \n 13\nfollowing mechanisms can also be envisaged [14]: Preferred breeding sites of M. sorbens are fresh human \nfaecal materials lying on the ground. High temperature and sunshine may induce rapid dryness of faecal \nmaterials, causing them to become inadequate breeding sites. Moreover, the lifespan of M. sorbens \nstrongly depends on temperature, decreasing from 35 days at 24\u00b0C to less than 12 days at 32\u00b0C, yielding \nless frequent contacts of M. sorbens with children's faces, and in turn, lower contamination of M. sorbens \nwith C. trachomatis [47, 48]. We did not find any significant association between age and trachoma \nprevalence and we suspect that this is due to the fact that pre-school aged children are not included in the \ncurrent surveys. Conditional upon these predictors, these data are consistent with the two pathogens being \nindependent. \n \nAs mentioned previously, the present study was designed to be as simple as possible in order to increase \nparticipation and to make it logistically manageable in settings with few resources. We therefore did not \ncollect observational data, such as water-use behavior, evidence of latrine use and hygienic habits\/states. \nPerhaps an investigation of the relationship between fly density, markers of socio-economic status, \nhygienic habits\/states and altitude in these sentinel sites could be informative. Such facts may have led us \nto missing more subtle or complex relationships between risk factors for urogenital schistosomiasis and \nactive trachoma [14] in the current study.  \n \nWe believe that despite the potential limitations contained in terms of age groups selected for the \nassessment of S. haematobium infection and active trachoma, the fact that there was found very low \nprevalence of co-infections in the studied sentinel sites, carries important implications for integrated \nNTDs surveillance and control strategies. The presence of relatively few co-infections has clear \nconsequences for the concept of integration of mapping, planning of drug delivery, and M&E of \nintegrated control programs for these two NTDs. Results of the current study are in accordance with \nobservations reported in the Plateau and Nasarawa States in Nigeria [17]. We agree with these authors\u2019 \nrecommendation that current population-based district level surveys for the mapping of trachoma should \nnot be replaced by school-based surveys. Finally, given that NTD interventions require baseline data for \ntargeting treatment and evaluation, the benefits of including more than one disease indicator in \noverlapping age groups when using an integrated M&E protocol, warrants further study. In particular, \ndifferent study designs would require further investigation. More research would also be needed to \nascertain whether the findings presented here can be generalized to West Africa and beyond.  \n \n 14\nConclusions \n \nTo our knowledge, very few previously published studies-three in Nigeria, Southern Sudan and Togo [17, \n23, 49] and another more recent one offering a conceptual framework around these issues [50]-have \ndiscussed and tested different survey methodologies for M&E of different NTDs in integrated control \nprogrammes. The current study aims to bridge some of these gaps and stimulate further research around \nthe methodologies for M&E for different NTDs by reporting on baseline findings from sentinel site \nsurveillance of S. haematobium and trachoma signs with an integrated M&E protocol in Burkina Faso.  \nWe conclude that the current approach may be useful to monitor and evaluate integrated programs \nincluding trachoma, but not for planning where SAFE implementation should occur. In addition, we \nwould recommend that current methodology to be modified to assess the younger age groups both for \nschistosomiasis and trachoma so that literature gets enriched from such data in the case of \nschistosomiasis, and at the same time key features of trachoma epidemiology can be captured. \n \nCompeting interests \nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests. \n \nAuthors' contributions \nAF obtained funding and AF & JPW were the principal investigators.
