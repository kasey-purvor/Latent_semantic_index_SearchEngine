Introduction 15 \n 16 \n Pyrolysis has been used extensively over the last 20 to 30 years as an analytical technique in which 17 \nlarge molecules are degraded into smaller volatiles species using only thermal energy.  The ultimate 18 \nobjective of analytical pyrolysis is to use the chromatographic information of pyrolysis products to 19 \ndetermine the composition or structure of the original sample.  The complexity of polymeric materials 20 \ncan vary extensively and they can be very challenging to analyse.  Pyrolysis, combined with modern 21 \nanalytical methods, such as gas chromatography and\/or mass spectrometry (Py-GC\/MS) has become a 22 \nquick, convenient and powerful tool for characterising polymers from involatile, complex 23 \nheterogeneous samples.  Previous reviews on Py-GC instrumentation, methods and applications were 24 \npublished by Wampler [1] and Wang [2] in 1999 and Moldoveanu [3] in 2001.  Since this time there 25 \nhave been major instrumental developments in laser pyrolysis systems and non-discriminating 26 \npyrolysis techniques as well as progress in the use of Py-GC for the detection of low level additives in 27 \npolymers. This review mainly covers the period from 1999 to 2007 but also included are references to 28 \nliterature before this period that appear not to have been covered in previous reviews. 29 \n 30 \n 31 \n2. Pyrolysis-GC technique 32 \n 33 \n2.1 Instrumental configuration 34 \n 35 \n The standard configuration of a pyrolysis-GC instrument has been discussed previously and largely 36 \nremains the same in that the pyrolysis device, or pyrolyzer, is interfaced with the analytical column of 37 \nthe GC via the injection port [2].  A flow of inert gas, such as nitrogen or helium, flushes the 38 \npyrolyzates into the column, where components are separated.  As discussed by Wampler, capillary 39 \ncolumns offer the advantage over packed columns of higher resolution [1].  The detection method used 40 \nis typically mass spectrometry but other GC detectors have also been employed depending on the 41 \nintentions of the analysis.  Nevertheless, instrument configuration is often varied.  Newly developed 42 \nthermal analysis equipment designed to enhance performance may replace existing ones or be 43 \nincorporated in order to meet specific applications.  Such developments include the use of lasers as a 44 \nfragmentation source and more recently a technique called in-column or non-discriminating pyrolysis, 45 \nall of which are discussed in detail below.  This constant refinement of instrumental devices and 46 \nparameters during the past 20 years provides an expansive record on the pyrolysis of polymers. 47 \n 48 \n 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \n2.1.1 Types of pyrolyzers 1 \n 2 \n The three most commonly used and recognised pyrolyzers for GC are the microfurnace, Curie-point 3 \nand resistively heated filament [1-2,4-6]. 4 \n The microfurnace rapidly raises the temperature of the sample until the pyrolysis temperature is 5 \nreached and then maintains this temperature for the desired pyrolysis time.  The samples are either 6 \ninjected or dropped into the pyrolysis zone by liquid syringe, solid plunger syringe or by using a small 7 \ncup.  The desired characteristics of this type of pyrolyzer, such as reproducibility, have always been 8 \ndifficult to develop [4].  Although much improved, most available furnaces still suffer from the relative 9 \ndrawback of rise times of several seconds [7].  Tsuge et al. developed a multifunctional microfurnace 10 \npyrolyzer for pyrolysis-GC and evolved gas analysis of various synthetic and natural materials [5,8].  11 \nThe system was composed of a double shot microfurnace pyrolyzer with a sophisticated temperature-12 \ncontrol device; a GC equipped with an ultrahigh-temperature metal, chemically inert capillary 13 \nseparation column; and a quadrupole MS with an electron impact (EI) and\/or chemical ionization (CI) 14 \nsource.  It proved to be a very effective tool for a wider range of applications including, the structural 15 \ncharacterisation of copolymer-type polycarbonates (PCs), the determination of flame-retardant 16 \nmechanisms of PC, trace determination of stabilizers, the rapid characterisation of natural products, and 17 \nforensic identification of various drugs and oils. 18 \n Curie-point pyrolyzers accurately reproduce pyrolysis conditions using ferromagnetic metals.  The 19 \nsample, which is positioned on to the end of a pyrolysis wire made from an appropriate ferromagnetic 20 \nalloy, is inserted into the pyrolyzer and rapidly heated using a high frequency induction coil.  The 21 \ntemperature ceases to rise when the Curie-point of the metal has been reached; that is the exact 22 \nreproducible temperature at which the ferromagnetic material loses its magnetism.  At this point the 23 \ntemperature remains constant until the coil is switched off [7].  In contrast to the microfurnace, the rise 24 \ntime of Curie-point pyrolyzers is much quicker from 0.2 to 0.4 seconds.  However, the choice of 25 \ndifferent pyrolysis temperatures is limited since they are determined by the Curie-points of available 26 \nmaterials [9].  Buco et al. used Curie-point Py-GC\/MS for the determination of polyaromatic 27 \nhydrocarbons (PAHs) in contaminated soil [10].  The technique proved particularly effective for low-28 \nmolecular-mass PAHs but lacked in sensitivity for quantification of high-molecular-mass PAHs.  It 29 \ndemanded a short operating time and required no extraction solvent.  In addition, the results showed 30 \ngood accuracy for the measured PAHs when compared with a certified soil. 31 \n Filament pyrolyzers can acquire a controlled pyrolysis temperature extremely quickly by using a 32 \npiece of resistive metal.  An initial pulse of heating at a high voltage produces a current through the 33 \nmetal causing the filament to heat rapidly until the programmed pyrolysis temperature is reached.  The 34 \npyrolysis temperature is maintained by reducing the voltage.  Various commercial models of the 35 \nPyroprobe appear to be the most widely used filament pyrolyzer.  Samples that are soluble in a volatile 36 \nsolvent are pyrolysed using a ribbon probe, those that are not are heated using a coil probe [4].  Whilst 37 \nsamples are added directly onto the ribbon probe, quartz tubes are used to hold the samples before 38 \nbeing inserted into the coil probe.  With regards to the latter, the exact pyrolysis reaction time is 39 \ndifficult to determine since the sample never comes into direct contact with the filament [9].  40 \nReproducibility with this system is very good providing that care is taken to ensure consistency with 41 \nsample size and positioning [4,11]. 42 \n Heated filament and Curie-point pyrolysis result in less secondary pyrolysis products compared to 43 \nfurnace pyrolysis and thus, the resulting pyrograms are easier to interpret.  A major disadvantage exists 44 \nwith all three conventional pyrolyzers in that because they are mounted external to the GC system, they 45 \nare prone to the deposition of higher-boiling point pyrolyzates and condensation of reaction products in 46 \nthe transfer line.  This often results in sample losses and discrimination of high-molecular weight 47 \ncomponents [9,12]. 48 \n 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \n 1 \n2.1.2 Importance of pyrolysis-GC interface 2 \n 3 \n The rapid and efficient transfer of pyrolysis products from the pyrolysis zone to the GC column is 4 \nvital in order to attain good peak resolution.  The interfacing of these two devices is therefore very 5 \nimportant.  Several parameters for the pyrolyzer have been identified in order to achieve this [1].  The 6 \npyrolyzer needs to heat the sample as instantaneously as possible to prevent drawn out transfer of the 7 \npyrolyzates through the injection port.  It also needs to have a small internal volume and a rapid carrier 8 \nflow to make sure all of the volatiles are swept out and onto the column and are not left in the hot zone 9 \nto undergo secondary pyrolysis.  Finally, a small sample size is essential to ensure that all of it degrades 10 \nrapidly, and that the column capacity is not exceeded.  At too large a sample size, parts of the sample 11 \nmay pyrolyze before others affecting reproducibility.  As a result of these operating conditions, 12 \ninterfacing between the pyrolyzer and the GC injection port should be kept minimal to reduce the 13 \nsurface area and volume through which the pyrolyzate compounds travel.  It should also be kept hot 14 \nand insulated to eliminate cold spots and prevent condensation reactions. 15 \n The above conditions are not always attainable or suitable for particular experiments and variations 16 \nalways occur.  For example, lower temperatures are often used to study the degradation kinetics of a 17 \nmaterial i.e. its thermal stability and degradation mechanisms. 18 \n 19 \n 20 \n2.1.3 Types of detectors 21 \n 22 \n The purpose of a detector used in conjunction with pyrolysis-GC is to monitor the carrier gas as it 23 \nleaves the column and respond to changes in its composition as solutes are eluted.  Ideally a detector 24 \nshould show a rapid response time, a wide range of linear response and high sensitivity.  Mass 25 \nSpectrometry continues to be the most widely used detector in qualitative and quantitative polymer 26 \nanalysis.  The main advantage with MS is that it preserves the complex patterns of the initial sample by 27 \nmeans of a mass spectrum corresponding to each peak in the GC profile, therefore allowing for the 28 \ncharacterisation of polymers, the identification of additives and contaminants in polymeric samples and 29 \nthe determination of degradation mechanisms.  The different methods of sample ionization available 30 \nfor MS allow for different degrees of fragmentation of the sample.  Electron impact ionization involves 31 \nthe bombardment of sample molecules with high energy electrons and is the usual choice for the 32 \nidentification and structural analysis of complex macromolecules because it results in a higher degree 33 \nof dissociation.  Chemical ionization has also been used in polymer analysis for much gentler, more 34 \nselective ionization whereby much less dissociation into ions of smaller mass occurs.  Recently an 35 \nalternative selective ionization method, metastable atom bombardment, has been reported [13-15] 36 \nallowing the direct and fast insertion of samples into the mass spectrometer reducing analysis time.  37 \nQuadrupole MS analysers, in particular, offer different modes by which mass spectra can be acquired 38 \ndepending on the purpose of the investigation.  Selected ion monitoring (SIM) compared to total ion 39 \nmonitoring is a much more sensitive scanning mode for target compound identification.  Instead of 40 \ncompleting full scans of the chromatogram and collecting all of the ion fragments, SIM only measures 41 \nand records pre-selected ions for a given retention time window.  Thus if fragments were created at m\/z 42 \nvalues other than those selected, data regarding those ions would not be recorded.  SIM requires the 43 \nretention data of compounds to perform a scan and in the case of co-eluting pyrolysis products; it is not 44 \nable to distinguish between two compounds with the same mass ions and retention time. 45 \n Magnetic, quadrupole, ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometers have all been successfully 46 \ncoupled to conventional Py-GC instruments.  The rapid analysis of polymers has specifically been 47 \nachieved using time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) [11,13].  TOF-MS can acquire high-48 \ndensity data across narrow GC peaks and has proven to be a suitable detection system for fast GC 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \nseparations without compromising the chromatographic peak information.  There is an extensive 1 \namount of literature available on the use of Py-GC\/MS for a wide range of applications, some of which 2 \nwill be mentioned throughout this review and some of which have been reviewed in a recent paper by 3 \nPeacock and McEwen [16]. 4 \n Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) has also been successfully combined with Py-GC.  IRMS 5 \nallows for the highly precise analysis of the stable-isotopic composition of organic compounds 6 \nseparated by GC.  All IRMS instruments work in EI mode, use a single magnetic-sector analyzer, and 7 \nmultiple Faraday detectors for analog measurement of ion currents.  A more detailed overview and 8 \nevaluation of IRMS is provided in a recent paper by Sessions [17].  Although not yet a widely used 9 \ntechnique, Py-GC\/IRMS has proven to be useful for some applications.  Pel et al. performed cytometric 10 \ncell sorting and compound-specific Py-GC\/IRMS analysis to determine population-specific isotopic 11 \nsignatures and growth rates in cyanobacteria-dominated lake plankton [18].  They reported that Py-12 \nGC\/IRMS was able to analyse very small samples and reduced the chances of contamination and 13 \nsample loss during handling.  Impressed with the resolution achieved, they also recognized the 14 \npotential of Py-GC\/IRMS in the future analysis of plankton dynamics.  A similar study used Py-15 \nGC\/IRMS to determine planktonic community structure and trophic interactions and further 16 \nrecommended the technique for carbon isotope-based food web studies [19].  In a more unusual study, 17 \nPy-GC\/IRMS was used to obtain isotopic and structural information from the macromolecular material 18 \nin meteorites [20].  The results highlighted the ability of the technique to analyse milligram-sized 19 \nsamples without compromising the resolution.  Gleixner et al. studied the individual turnover rate of 20 \nspecific carbohydrates, lignin, lipids and N-containing compounds from French arable soil using Curie-21 \npoint Py-GC\/IRMS [21].  Again its potential as a technique to analyse organic compounds was 22 \nhighlighted. 23 \n Differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) [22] and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) [23-25] are 24 \nrecognized methods for the detection of chemical and biological agents (gases, vapors and aerosols) in 25 \nfield settings.  As advanced portable instruments they are small, highly sensitive, require little power 26 \nand are capable of fast analysis times.  Py-GC\/IMS has proved particularly useful for the detection and 27 \nidentification of certain degradation compounds resulting from the pyrolysis of biological material, 28 \nsuch as bacterial spores which could be used as biological warfare agents. Open and closed sample 29 \nintroduction tubes have been used in the Py-GC\/IMS system for the detection of biological aerosol 30 \nparticulates and chemical compounds in water respectively.  A study in 2001 made improvements to an 31 \nexisting Py-GC\/IMS system in order to increase the amount of pyrolyzate compound information 32 \nreaching the IMS detector [23].  The airflow enhancement through the pyrolysis tube allowed for an 33 \nincrease in the previously observed biomarkers for aerosols.  The altered Py-GC\/IMS instrument was 34 \nsubjected to several outdoor aerosol trials in which it was shown to provide information regarding the 35 \nbiological or non-biological nature of an aerosol and more specifically discriminate between aerosols 36 \nof a gram-positive spore, a gram-negative bacterium, and a protein.  Yinon provides a comprehensive 37 \nreview on instrumental advances and developments in IMS and further assesses its ability as a fast, 38 \ngeneral analytical measurement device [24].  A recent study compared both open tube and closed tube 39 \nsample introduction Py-GC\/IMS systems for the analysis of water contaminated with a surrogate 40 \nchemical warfare agent [25].  Results showed that the limit of detection for the VX nerve agent 41 \nsurrogate was lowered by two orders of magnitude for the closed injector compared to the open tube 42 \nsystem, making the closed tube Py-GC\/IMS system more suitable for detecting chemicals in liquids. 43 \n Besides MS [26-30] and mobility spectrometers, other Py-GC detection methods have been reported 44 \nfor a wide variety of applications.  These include, flame ionization detection (FID) [31-36] and atomic 45 \nemission detection (AED) [37-40]. 46 \n 47 \n 48 \n2.2 Sample preparation 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \n 1 \n Often, time consuming pre-treatments of the sample are required to make it amenable for Py-GC\/MS 2 \nanalysis.  Depending on the nature of the sample, this can involve a simple hydrolysis or dissolution 3 \nstep and\/or a more complex derivatization process. 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n2.2.1 Derivatization 7 \n 8 \n Derivatization involves the conversion of non-volatile polar or thermally sensitive compounds into 9 \nrelated more volatile derivatives.  It is a well established technique in pyrolysis-GC, extending the 10 \ncapabilities of pyrolyzate analysis by improving the behaviour of the analyte during separation in the 11 \ncolumn, modifying the thermal degradation pathway or enhancing detectability of the analyte.  12 \nDifferent methods of derivatization have been reported, namely hydrogenation, methylation and 13 \nsilylation, whereby the hydroxyl, carboxyl and amino functional groups in polar compounds are 14 \nconverted into much less polar methyl, trimethyl or trifluoroacetyl derivatives of greater volatility using 15 \nappropriate reagents.  The most commonly used derivatising reagent is tetramethylammonium 16 \nhydroxide (TMAH) although other quaternary ammonium hydroxides have also been reported as 17 \neffective reagents.  Haffenden and co-workers developed a novel Py-GC\/MS based methodology to 18 \nanalyse the composition of non-volatile residues of Maillard reaction products in two separate studies 19 \n[41,42].  Both studies involved a post-pyrolytic in-situ derivatization technique, the first using 20 \nhexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) and the second using trimethylsilyldiethylamine as silylating reagents.  21 \nThe application of the technique indicated the formation of several derivatives in both cases.  The 22 \nanalytical characterisation of diterpenoid and acrylic resins employed in art works has been achieved 23 \nusing an on-line derivatization method using HMDS reagent and Py-GC\/MS [43,44].  Results obtained 24 \nwere compared with previously reported results from in-situ thermally assisted hydrolysis and 25 \nmethylation with TMAH.  Several non-reported trimethylsilylated derivatives of compounds present in 26 \nthe diterpenoid resins were identified.  In both cases, improved sensitivity, better resolution of the most 27 \nrepresentative peaks and more simplified, well-resolved chromatograms were obtained by using HMDS 28 \nas a derivatizing reagent. 29 \n Thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation (THM) is an alternative on-line derivatization 30 \ntechnique for Py-GC\/MS, which is much simpler and faster compared to wet chemically derivatization 31 \nmethods.  Asperger and co-workers analysed natural waxes using THM in the presence of TMAH, 32 \ncarried out on a filament pyrolyzer [45,46].  They found THM to be a very suitable derivatization 33 \nmethod which was able to overcome problems such as the generation of non-specific pyrolyzates 34 \nobserved in conventional Py-GC analysis of waxes.  The method enabled both rapid fingerprinting and 35 \ndetailed compositional analysis by means of structural elucidation of the THM products.  The effect of 36 \nTMAH used in THM, in comparison with the effect of sodium hydroxide on the slow pyrolysis of 37 \ncotton cellulose has been reported [47].  Information regarding the reactive decomposition of cellulose 38 \nwas obtained using Py-GC\/MS.  In a recent study, Ikeya et al. compared an off-line methylation 39 \nmethod using carbanion and methyl iodide reagent with thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation 40 \nusing TMAH on Py-GC analysis of humic and fulvic acids [48].  The off-line methylation proved to be 41 \nthe better method as it produced additional information on structural unit of humic substances. 42 \n There are a number of excellent reviews available on derivatization methods.  Wang discussed both 43 \npre and post-derivatization techniques adapted for Py-GC analysis [2].  Particular focus was placed on 44 \nthe developments in pre-pyrolysis derivatization, which is used to convert the functional group in the 45 \npolymer to obtain a favourable degradation pathway during pyrolysis.  A review on Py-GC\/MS by 46 \nMoldoveanu in 2001 reported advancements in derivatization techniques including methylation and 47 \nsilylation [3].  The same year, a review by Challinor on the development and applications of on-line 48 \nand off-line thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation reactions in analytical pyrolysis was 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \npublished [49].  Trimethylsulphonium hydroxide (TMSH), tetramethylammonium acetate (TMAAc) 1 \nand N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) reagents provided more specific advantages 2 \nwhen compared to TMAH where particular applications were required.  A recent review by Halket and 3 \nZaikin published in 2006 describes on-line derivatization methods employed in mass spectrometry, 4 \nincluding Py-GC\/MS [50]. 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n2.3 Instrumental developments 8 \n 9 \n Gains in chromatographic sensitivity are continually being made with improved techniques and 10 \ninstrumentation, including the design of sophisticated gas inlet systems and interfaces which improve 11 \nthe efficiency of the trapping and transfer of gaseous products to the GC column.  In addition, progress 12 \ncontinues to be made with GC detectors including mass spectrometry, which also contributes to the 13 \never increasing power of Py-GC systems.  However, details regarding such improvements are beyond 14 \nthe scope of this review.  The most significant instrumental improvements in pyrolysis-GC include 15 \nlaser pyrolyzers for the analysis of microscopic samples, and non-discriminating pyrolysis for the 16 \nanalysis of high-molecular weight pyrolysis products. 17 \n 18 \n 19 \n2.3.1 Laser pyrolysis-GC 20 \n 21 \n Micro analytical techniques that facilitate the separate analysis of distinct regions within complex 22 \nheterogeneous samples have an increasing application in polymer analysis.  Laser pyrolysis-gas 23 \nchromatography (laser Py-GC), or laser micropyrolysis-GC, is one such technique, however studies 24 \nwhich have utilized this method are limited.  Although early works involving the analytical technique 25 \nand its applications date back to the early 1970s, recent studies are still primarily focussed on 26 \ninstrumental development.  This lack of progress is due to a number of factors including i) the 27 \nsensitivity limitations of existing chromatographic technologies required for testing the typically small 28 \nproduct concentrations; ii) the inter-disciplinary skills needed; iii) the financial expense of the different 29 \ninstruments; iv) the difficulties involved with interfacing these instruments; v) the lack of 30 \nunderstanding of the interactions between laser and material; and vi) the issue that not all samples are 31 \ncompatible with laser radiation to produce pyrolysis products [51,52]. 32 \n The laser pyrolysis or micropyrolysis system (Fig. 1) consists of the laser and associated optical 33 \ndevice; the sample chamber and cold trap; and a GC\/MS for separation and detailed molecular 34 \ncharacterisation of the pyrolysis products (i.e. molecular fingerprinting).  Interfacing between the 35 \nsample chamber and the cold trap inside the GC injection port has been achieved using a heated 36 \ntransfer tube, a sophisticated gas inlet system, or more recently using a specially designed pyrolysis 37 \nvalve interface which can function both on-line and off-line (CDS Analytical, model 1500).  Solid 38 \npolymer samples of small size are mounted in the sample chamber and then viewed through the 39 \nmicroscope until a suitable area to be pyrolyzed is located.  The laser is focussed through the 40 \nmicroscope objective and the targeted area is pyrolyzed using either a continuous wave or a number of 41 \nhigh-energy pulses.  The size of the crater formed and thus the intensity of pyrolyzate distribution is 42 \ndependent upon the degree of focussing and the time span and energy setting of the laser.  During 43 \npyrolysis, a helium carrier gas sweeps the pyrolyzates from the sample cell and (ultimately) onto the 44 \ncold trap via a heated transfer line.  Once collected, components are desorbed onto the GC column for 45 \nsubsequent analysis. 46 \n The use of a laser and a microscope in place of a conventional pyrolyzer such as those mentioned 47 \nearlier, facilitates visual observation of the sample and focusing of the laser beam onto a specific area 48 \nand layer to achieve selective heating.  This can therefore provide useful data on the molecular 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \ncompositional units of macromolecules in situ, something that traditional bulk pyrolysis methods 1 \ncannot.  The short duration laser beam is collimated enabling it to target the isolated components with 2 \nan immense amount of thermal energy [53].  This thermal interaction between laser and material 3 \ninitiates a shock which in turn produces a range of pyrolysis products [11].  These extreme heating 4 \nrates are characteristic of laser pyrolysis and also serve a great purpose in minimizing secondary 5 \npyrolysis reactions. 6 \n A variety of different lasers can be used as a fragmentation source depending on the type of material 7 \nbeing pyrolysed.  Greenwood et al. analysed various organic fossil samples, namely Sydney Basin 8 \ntorbanite, Green River oil shale and Tasmanite oil shale, to test the efficiency and potency of laser 9 \nmicropyrolysis-GC\/MS equipped with a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser with a near IR output (1064 10 \nnm) [51,53].  A pulsed ruby laser (694.3 nm) was used to study the in-situ pyrolysis of individual coal 11 \nmacerals [54].  Thomsen & Egsgaard described an instrumental set-up for the pressurized laser-induced 12 \npyrolysis of coal foils using the visible blue-green emission from an argon ion laser (458-515 nm) [55].  13 \nChoi et al. performed direct chemical analysis of UV laser ablation products of organic polymers using 14 \nan ArF excimer laser (193 nm) coupled to a Py-GC\/MS [56].  Other applications involving all of these 15 \nlaser sources have been briefly reviewed by Meruva and co-workers [11,52].  They themselves 16 \ndesigned and developed a novel instrument for rapid characterisation of synthetic polymers using UV 17 \nlaser pyrolysis coupled to fast GC and TOF-MS.  The combined Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, frequency 18 \nquadrupled to 266 nm, was used on a model polymer (polyethylene) in order to measure the production 19 \nand distribution of pyrolysis products.  They provide an excellent discussion evaluating the effects of 20 \nexperimental factors and interactions on the performance of the laser Py-GC\/TOF-MS system in 21 \ncomparison to conventional filament pyrolysis. 22 \n Unlike the filament, Curie-point and furnace pyrolyzer, laser pyrolysis requires very little sample 23 \npreparation or pre-treatment since analysis is performed directly on the solid polymer matter.  The 24 \nsample is therefore much easier to handle and consequently analysis time is greatly reduced.  However, 25 \na common problem encountered with using laser radiation is that a specific laser wavelength may not 26 \nbe appropriate for all types of materials.  The transparency of some polymers at the laser wavelength 27 \nmakes them more difficult to degrade thermally.  To overcome this, researches have found that the 28 \nsample can be indirectly pyrolysed by embedding it in a strongly absorbing matrix such as powdered 29 \ncarbon [57] or graphite, or by depositing the sample on an absorbing surface such as blue cobalt glass 30 \n[58].  However, it has been reported that by heating the sample indirectly, both the heating rate and 31 \nmaximum temperature are decreased [59].  Armitage et al. discussed the difficulties in directly 32 \nanalyzing synthetic fibres using near IR laser radiation (1064 nm) due to their transparency at this 33 \nwavelength [60].  Consequently the fibres were impregnated in a graphite matrix and then pyrolysed.  34 \nThey concluded that the use of additional laser sources such as UV or visible lasers may have enhanced 35 \nthe analytical scope of their method.  Metz and co-workers reported that by using a 1064 nm Nd:YAG 36 \nlaser, frequency quadrupled to 266 nm, the addition of carbon or other sample supports could be 37 \navoided [52].  Since most organic compounds efficiently absorb UV energy, optically transparent 38 \npolymers could be directly pyrolysed. 39 \n The capabilities of laser pyrolysis-GC have been assessed in many areas of research including 40 \ngeochemistry and petrology [61,62], natural and synthetic organic polymers [63,64], and forensic 41 \nscience [60] (Fig. 2).  Laser energy continues to be a suitable source to generate pyrolysis for the in-situ 42 \nmolecular investigation of macromolecules. 43 \n 44 \n 45 \n2.3.2 Non-discriminating pyrolysis-GC 46 \n 47 \n Discrimination of high molecular weight compounds during the pyrolysis of complex mixtures is a 48 \nsignificant problem with all types of conventional pyrolyzers [12, 65-67] as these fragments often carry 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \nvery significant structural information.  Efforts have been made using a laser pyrolysis system to 1 \nanalyse both low and high molecular pyrolyzates [52].  A technique called in-column pyrolysis (Fig. 3) 2 \nestablished in 2000 was designed to overcome this problem by enabling the pyrolysis step to be 3 \nperformed in-line with the GC column [9].  Samples were introduced by hand into a disposable, inert 4 \nstainless steel capillary tube, which was then heated rapidly to the pyrolysis temperature using an 5 \nelectric current.  The entire assembly was contained within the GC oven to prevent cold spots in the 6 \nsystem.  Initial experiments demonstrated no discrimination effects of high boiling point compounds 7 \nand excellent pyrolysis reproducibility.  However, limitations of the in-column pyrolysis system 8 \nincluded disconnection of the column every time a new sample was analyzed and inaccurate control of 9 \nsample amount, position and temperature due to manual sample introduction [68].  Beyer et al. 10 \ndeveloped and evaluated an automated in-column pyrolysis-GC\/MS system which they found to offer 11 \nnew opportunities for quantitation of polymers or other high molecular weight materials due to high 12 \nreproducibility of peak areas [12].  The system included the option to work in normal injection mode 13 \nand in pyrolysis mode simultaneously, thus facilitating the analysis of compounds such as additives in 14 \npolymers, and the characterisation of the non-volatile fraction in a single run. 15 \n Considerations regarding the advantages and disadvantages of in-column pyrolysis have led to the 16 \nrecent development of a new system.  Non-discriminating pyrolysis-GC, like in-column pyrolysis, is 17 \nspecifically designed to minimize the transfer losses of larger fragments from the pyrolysis unit to the 18 \nGC column so that important structural information among other things can be obtained.  Several 19 \ndesigns have been developed and tested but the general configuration of a non-discriminating pyrolysis 20 \nsystem is much like a normal Py-GC\/MS in that the pyrolysis step is performed external to the GC and 21 \nnot in-line with the GC column in the GC oven (Fig. 4).  Instead of a conventional pyrolyzer, pyrolysis 22 \noccurs in an inert, Silcosteel capillary tube which is interfaced to the GC through a septumless injector 23 \nin the GC injection port.  The sample is secured inside the capillary tube using fused-silica wool plugs, 24 \nthe narrowness of the tube assuring that the temperature at the sample remains consistent with that at 25 \nthe heating element at all times.  Pyrolysis of the sample is achieved using an electric current.  The 26 \naddition of a ceramic shield ensures the capillary pyrolysis temperature is not affected by external air 27 \ncurrents.  An inert gas supply to the capillary column during pyrolysis flushes the pyrolyzates out of the 28 \nhot zone thus preventing secondary reactions and allowing for the recovery of higher molecular weight 29 \nproducts through post-heating.  A more detailed description of the instrumentation is available 30 \nelsewhere [68].  The technique can be used for any type of material and despite its novelty, has already 31 \nbeen used to study samples including synthetic and naturally occurring polymers [69].  In a study by 32 \nParsi et al., the performance of non-discriminating Py-GC\/MS in the characterisation of natural organic 33 \nmatter (NOM) was assessed [70].  The results were compared to those also obtained using a filament 34 \nand a Curie-point pyrolyzer.  The study showed that the ambiguity caused by mass discrimination 35 \nagainst larger fragments was dramatically reduced with non-discriminating Py-GC\/MS compared to 36 \nthat of conventional pyrolysis approaches.  Larger fragments such as traces of cholesterol in the 37 \npyrolysis of chitin were detected, which could not be observed with the commercial pyrolyzers.  38 \nFurthermore, the macromolecular pyrolyzates showed a greater abundance in the pyrograms of various 39 \npolyaromatic and long-chain aliphatic compounds obtained via non-discriminating Py-GC\/MS.  In 40 \nanother study, non-discriminating Py-GC\/MS was used for the detection of ergosterol in various 41 \nsamples [70].  As the major sterol constituent in fungi, ergosterol is an essential chemical indicator of 42 \nfungal contamination.  Results showed that it was clearly detected in all of the samples and the authors 43 \nreported that the benefits of non-discriminating pyrolysis including no sample preparation, small 44 \nsample size and short analysis time, far outweighed those of other techniques.  The profiling of fatty 45 \nacids in bacterial biomasses using non-discriminating TMAH induced thermochemolysis Py-GC\/MS 46 \nhas also been reported [71]. 47 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \n On the whole, not only is the performance of the modified non-discriminating pyrolysis system much 1 \nbetter than the original in-column pyrolysis system, it is also much easier to use.  It offers great 2 \npotential for the future analysis of high molecular weight pyrolyzates. 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n3. Thermal degradation 6 \n 7 \n The kinetics of thermal degradation and structure determination of polymers and co-polymers has 8 \nbeen covered in great detail in other reviews [2-3,72] and with little development in this area it is best 9 \nto refer to those papers. 10 \n 11 \n3.1. Degradation properties 12 \n 13 \n Degradation results from free radical reactions initiated by bond breaking within the molecules; the 14 \nbond that is more easily broken will be favoured.  Thermal and environmental conditions, such as 15 \ntemperature and additional reactants, can affect both the extent and route of degradation of a polymeric 16 \nmaterial and the nature (physical and chemical) and quantity of molecular species generated by 17 \npyrolysis.  Molecular degradation of a sample will occur as soon as the temperature is high enough to 18 \ninitiate bond breaking, but at this point will not necessarily yield much useful product [1].  With much 19 \nhigher temperatures, other bonds will break simultaneously, creating very small and non-specific free 20 \nradicals.  Generally, the higher the temperature, the smaller the radicals and molecules produced.  The 21 \noptimum pyrolysis temperature, which will be different for every polymer, is the point at which 22 \ndegradation produces a wide array of chemically useful products.  Poly \u03b1-methylstyrene for example 23 \nyields 100% of monomer at 500\u00b0C, 88.5% at 800\u00b0C and only 37.7% at 1200\u00b0C [73].  These products, 24 \nidentified using GC\/MS, can provide a fingerprint of the original polymer and copolymer composition 25 \nand microstructure and help determine the degradation mechanisms. 26 \n The chemical composition of a polymer can also affect its degradation properties.  Stauffer discussed 27 \nhow the substitution of a hydrogen atom with a CH3 group can alter the point at which the polymer 28 \nchain breaks, affecting the degradation route and amount of product yielded [73]. 29 \n Low level compounds added to a polymer, intended to alter its physical or chemical properties, are 30 \nanother factor which may influence its degradation properties and make the analysis of its products 31 \nvery challenging.  Some additives can be thermally removed from the polymer before they degrade by 32 \nheating the sample to a sub-pyrolysis temperature.  In this instance the polymer undergoes degradation 33 \nat a set pyrolysis temperature and the pyrogram should only contain peaks from the polymer itself.  34 \nHowever, polymer additives present a problem in that they cannot be removed and must be pyrolysed 35 \nalong with the polymer matrix.  The degradation behaviour of the original polymer and the additive 36 \nwill differ due to differences in their size, structure and composition therefore products generated from 37 \nadditives are often overshadowed by products generated from the polymer itself.  More complex 38 \nmacromolecular additives produce even more degradation products upon pyrolysis, significantly 39 \nchanging the appearance of the pyrogram by reducing the size of other peaks.  Recently, a multi-step 40 \napproach has been used to thermally separate compound families at intervals during pyrolysis in order 41 \nto simplify the pyrograms [74]. 42 \n 43 \n 44 \n3.2 Mechanisms 45 \n 46 \n Pyrolysis products reflect the molecular structure, free radical stability, substitution and internal 47 \nrearrangements of the polymers constituting the sample material [1].  Thus, the degradation 48 \nmechanisms undertaken are dependent upon the structure and bond dissociation energies of the 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \npolymers.  Consequently a polymer may take multiple degradation routes simultaneously.  Identical 1 \nmolecules, heated to the same temperature will break apart and rearrange in the same characteristic 2 \nway.  The understanding of these mechanisms has led to improved interpretations of pyrograms.  The 3 \nthree main mechanisms include random scission, side-group scission, and monomer reversion [73].   4 \n Random scission involves the random breaking of the polymer\u2019s C-C bonded backbone as all the 5 \nbonds are of equal strength, resulting in the formation of products including, alkanes, alkenes and 6 \nalkadienes of smaller sizes.  Figure 5 shows the random scission of polyethylene.  Upon pyrolysis the 7 \nproducts formed can be seen clearly on a chromatogram as a familiar series of \u201ctriplet\u201d peaks. 8 \n Side-group scission occurs when the side groups attached to the backbone are broken away resulting 9 \nin the backbone becoming polyunsaturated.  Its subsequent rearrangement produces aromatic 10 \ncompounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene and naphthalene as shown in Figure 6.  11 \nPolymers including styrene, vinyl and some rubbers will undergo side-group scission. 12 \n During monomer reversion, the polymer simply unzips and reverts back to its original monomeric 13 \nversion otherwise referred to as depolymerisation.  Usually only one predictable compound is 14 \nproduced.  Polymers known to undergo this mechanism include polymethylmethacrylate (Fig. 7), 15 \npolytetrafluoroethylene, poly \u03b1-methylstyrene and polyoxymethylene. 16 \n Other mechanisms do exist but are not as common as those mentioned above; cross-linking and char 17 \nformation is one of them.  The occurrence of more cross-linking within the polymer molecules during 18 \npyrolysis ultimately strengthens the product, creating only a small number of volatiles.  Typical 19 \npolymers undergoing this route include polyacrylonitriles or phenolic resins.  The thermal behaviour 20 \nand degradation mechanisms, or rearrangements, in the pyrolysis of natural and synthetic polymeric 21 \nmaterials, as well as other organic compounds, are continually being investigated. 22 \n It has been noted how, under various temperatures for the pyrolysis of polymers, traditional Py-23 \nGC\/MS is unable to distinguish the main degradation mechanism and evolved product distribution at 24 \nspecific temperature regions [75].  Whilst studying the pyrolysis of poly(aryl-ether-ether-ketone) and 25 \npoly(arylene sulfone)s, Perng and co-workers overcame this issue by using stepwise pyrolysis-GC\/MS.  26 \nThe method facilitated consecutive heating of the sample at fixed temperature intervals, thus achieving 27 \nnarrow temperature pyrolysis conditions and enabling the dominant pyrolysis mechanisms to be 28 \nobtained [76,77].  A similar study of the thermal degradation mechanism of poly(ether imide) has also 29 \nbeen reported [75].  The major mechanisms determined were two-stage pyrolysis, involving main-chain 30 \nrandom scission and carbonization.  Guo et al. identified the thermal degradation behaviour of a novel 31 \nphosphorous-containing aromatic poly(ester amide) (ODOP-PEA) compound using Py-GC\/MS [78].  32 \nResults suggested that bond cleavage of the pendant phosphorous groups occurred initially but 33 \nmaximum decomposition was attributed to the main chain scission at higher temperatures.  High 34 \nresolution Py-GC\/MS was applied to analyse the degradation products of benzocyclobutene-terminated 35 \nimide polymers, a kind of thermoset polymer [79].  Degradation mechanisms including, thermal 36 \ncleavage, chain transfer, isomerization and cyclizations, were suggested and the relationship between 37 \npolymer structure and pyrolyzates was discussed. 38 \n It is important to recognize that the dominant degradation mechanisms or pathways undertaken 39 \nduring pyrolysis of a sample might not necessarily be the same for each type of material.  Most 40 \nexamples given above relate to the analysis of synthetic polymers however a significant number of 41 \nsamples analyzed by Py-GC are of natural origin.  For example, Sun and co-workers used a 42 \nmicrofurnace Py-GC\/MS to analyse the thermal behaviour of vitamin D3 [80].  The study was focussed 43 \non understanding what products were formed during the pyrolysis process in an attempt to identify the 44 \ningredient variation of the vitamin D3 that exists as crude and\/or additive forms in foods under high 45 \ntemperatures.  Furthermore, a number of studies on the analysis of natural organic matter using Py-GC 46 \nmethods have reported the formation of carbonaceous residue through charring as one of the major 47 \ndegradation processes [9]. 48 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \n Pyrolysis-GC has also been used to study the influence of additives on the thermal degradation 1 \npathways of polymers.  Ishikawa et al. studied the thermal degradation and flame retardancy of 2 \npolycarbonate with the addition of a variety of different flame retardant chemicals using Py-GC\/MS 3 \n[81].  Different mechanisms were observed including hydrolysis, bond cleavage and cross-linking.  4 \nAnother study focused on the thermal degradation of a polycarbonate containing methylphenyl-silicone 5 \nadditive [82].  With the use of Py-GC\/MS they deduced the addition of silicone could promote cross-6 \nlinking and char formation as the mass loss rate of PC in the major degradation step was decreased.  7 \nBond scission was another proposed degradation route, thought to have produced the main volatile 8 \ndecomposition products of the PC-silicone blends.  Bertini and Zuev investigated the influence of 9 \nfullerene C60 additives on the thermal behaviour and degradation mechanism of fully aromatic regular 10 \npolyesters using Py-GC\/MS [83].  The presence of fullerene, being an efficient radical acceptor, was 11 \nfound to alter the decomposition from a radical pathway to a non-radical pathway.  Jakab and 12 \nOmastova studied the thermal decomposition of carbon black composites, used as a reinforcing agent 13 \nand filler, with polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyisobutylene (PIB) [84].  Results of Py-14 \nGC\/MS experiments determined that the product distribution of polymers was dependent upon the level 15 \nof volatility of the carbon black.  The product distribution of both PE\/carbon black composites and 16 \nPP\/carbon black composites indicated that carbon black participated in a hydrogenation process.  17 \nMoreover, the formation of several other isomers during the degradation of PP composites also 18 \nindicated that carbon black promoted other mechanisms including, chain scission and radical transfer 19 \nreactions.  Depolymerisation was observed in the decomposition of PIB composites in the presence of 20 \ncarbon black. 21 \n 22 \n 23 \n4. Applications 24 \n 25 \n4.1 Art materials 26 \n 27 \n The chemical, physical and structural characterization of materials such as glues, paints, pigments, 28 \nbinders and varnishes used to create artistic masterpieces, continues to provide art historians and 29 \nconservators with precious information.  This knowledge enables restoration and conservation work to 30 \nbe carried out properly without causing any damage to the original artifacts [85] and also helps to 31 \nunderstand the techniques adopted by the artists.  The organic materials used as binders in art media 32 \nhave received considerable attention.  A review by Colombini and Modugno discusses the application 33 \nof chromatographic techniques including Py-GC for the characterisation of proteinaceous binders such 34 \nas animal skins or bones, egg and milk, or casein in artistic paintings [86].  Ling et al. attempted to 35 \ncharacterize the natural binding media used in ancient Chinese artworks including non-proteinaceous 36 \nmaterials such as Chinese lacquer, tung oil, deer glue, and peach gum using Py-GC\/MS [87].  The 37 \nkinds of natural resins used as the main ingredients in varnishes and binding media have also been 38 \nassayed [88], including terpenoid resins [89,90] and triterpenic resins from the Burseraceae family 39 \n[91].  Several studies have focused on the analysis of different artists\u2019 paints.  Chiavari et al. analysed 40 \nlipid materials used in paint layers using an in-situ pyrolysis and silylation method [92].  A paper by 41 \nBruck & Willard discusses the process of deformulation of paints in order to obtain ingredient and 42 \ncompositional information [93], and a paper by Scalarone & Chiantore reviews separation techniques 43 \nfor the analysis of acrylic emulsion paints [94].  Natural dyes used in works of art, namely madder, 44 \ncurcuma, saffron and indigo, have also been analysed by Py-GC\/MS [95], and finally an interesting 45 \nstudy by Bonaduce and Colombini used Py-GC\/MS to characterize beeswax from a sculpture called 46 \n\u201cThe Plague\u201d (1691-1694) by Gaetano Zumbo [96]. 47 \n 48 \n 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \n4.2 Biological samples 1 \n 2 \n Much work continues to be done in an effort to identify and differentiate biological materials such as 3 \nmicroorganisms.  A flash Py-GC\/MS method was reported for the rapid screening of bacterial species 4 \nin order to detect the presence of bacteriohopanepolyols [97] and more recently, Py-GC\/FID was 5 \nemployed for the quantitative pyrolysis of three different bacterial strains [32].  Goodacre et al. [98] 6 \ndetected a simple biomarker for the rapid detection of Bacillus spores using curie-point Py-GC\/MS, 7 \nwhilst Schwarzinger [99] identified specific marker compounds characteristic of fungi type.  The 8 \ndevelopment of a miniaturized Py-GC system for the rapid detection and identification of bacteria and 9 \nother pathogens has also been proposed [100].  Furthermore, the use of analytical pyrolysis in bio-10 \nterrorism studies has been evaluated [101].  In an interesting application, Buckley et al. used Py-11 \nGC\/MS to analyse the complex organic balms on tissues and wrappings from pharaonic animal 12 \nmummies in an effort to understand the mechanism of preservation in comparison to that observed with 13 \nhuman mummies [102].  Other applications of Py-GC in biological studies include the compositional 14 \nanalysis of Copoly(DL-Lactic\/Glycolic Acid) used in the medical and pharmaceutical fields when 15 \napplied to devices for wound closure, orthopedics and controlled drug release [103], and structural 16 \ninvestigations of neuromelanin from the human substantia nigra in the brain in an attempt to determine 17 \nif neuromelanin is involved in cell death in Parkinson\u2019s disease [104,105]. 18 \n 19 \n 20 \n4.3 Environmental 21 \n 22 \n Applications of Py-GC in environmental science continue to grow, as the benefits of the analytical 23 \ntechnique are still being discovered.  This is demonstrated in a paper by White et al. which describes 24 \nfour recent applications of Py-GC\/MS fingerprinting of environmental samples [106].  Several studies 25 \non the analyses of particulate organic matter (POM) suspended in water have been reported, such as a 26 \npaper by Yildiz et al. who used Py-GC\/MS to investigate suspended POM in open and coastal waters of 27 \nthe southern Black Sea and found evidence in the pyrograms of 23 marker compounds characteristic of 28 \nchlorophylls, lipids, carbohydrates and proteins formed during pyrolysis [107].  Volkman and Tanoue 29 \nhave reviewed the chemical and biological research carried out on POM in oceans across the globe and 30 \nin doing so have discussed Py-GC\/MS as a new approach [108].  In addition to the characterisation of 31 \nparticulate organic matter, research has been done on the organic matter in marine sediments.  Fabbri et 32 \nal. compared pyrolytic and lipid markers in the Adriatic Sea using semi-quantitative Py-GC\/MS and 33 \nclassical GC\/MS [109].  Much work has also been published on the analysis of soil [110,111].  A 34 \nrecent review on soil health discusses the progress that has been made in the development of molecular 35 \nand analytical methods, including Py-GC\/MS, and the application of these techniques in determining 36 \nsoil health status [112].  In another application, a Py-GC\/MS method for the analysis of the UV-B-37 \nabsorbing compounds in small numbers of pollen, spores and other microscopic entities was developed 38 \nin order to allow research toward the effect of increased UV-B radiation on plants [113]. 39 \n 40 \n 41 \n4.4 Food and agriculture 42 \n 43 \n Foodstuffs have been routinely analyzed by Py-GC for decades because of its ability to analyse 44 \ncomplex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides and lipids.  Halket and Schulten studied several 45 \nwhole foodstuffs namely ground roast coffee, rosehip tea, wheatmeal biscuit, chocolate drink powder 46 \nand milk chocolate, and were able to differentiate them all by examining the molecular weight 47 \ndistributions of released volatiles and pyrolysis products in their spectra [114].  The identification and 48 \nquantification of soy protein in ground beef has also been reported [115].  Several papers have 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \ndescribed rapid Py-GC\/MS derivatization methods for profiling of fatty acids in vegetable oils and 1 \nanimal fats [116], including a study by Fabbri et al. who used dimethyl carbonate and titanium silicate 2 \nas non-toxic derivatising agents to analyse soybean, coconut, linseed, walnut and olive oil [117]. 3 \n Agricultural applications of analytical pyrolysis are mostly focused on soil chemistry, more 4 \nspecifically soil structure and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics and composition.  Nierop et al. 5 \ninvestigated the differences in the chemical composition of SOM within one soil series from three 6 \ndifferently managed fields in The Netherlands [118].  Results using a combination of Py-GC\/MS and 7 \nthermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation with TMAH determined that SOM composition is hardly 8 \naffected by organic farming compared to conventional management i.e. high tillage intensity and 9 \nintensive fertilization.  Similarly, Marinari and co-workers used carbon fraction pools and pyrolytic 10 \nindices as an indication of SOM quality under organic and conventional management in central Italy 11 \n[119].  Furthermore, Rodriguez et al. evaluated chemical-structural properties of SOM under different 12 \nagronomical practices of the Venezuelan central plains by measuring the relative abundance of volatile 13 \norganic products produced by pyrolysis [120], and the chemical composition of organic matter in 14 \nvarious fresh and composted wastes has been characterized by Dignac et al. [121].  A comparison 15 \nbetween organic and mineral fertilization in the investigation of chemical and biochemical changes in 16 \nSOM has also been reported, in which the detection of high levels of water soluble organic carbon and 17 \naliphatic pyrolytic products confirmed that mineral fertilization caused greater alteration of native SOM 18 \nthan the organic amendments [122]. 19 \n 20 \n 21 \n4.5 Geochemistry and fuel sources 22 \n 23 \n Investigations involving petrochemical related materials, of which there are several categories, are 24 \nnot a new phenomenon in Py-GC studies.  The structural characterisation and differentiation of 25 \nkerogens for example has received much attention in previous years but despite great progress, some 26 \nknowledge of their chemical structure and the mechanism by which they form and change in time on 27 \nEarth is still limited.  Gonz\u00e1lez-Vila and co-workers analysed a set of kerogen concentrates using Py-28 \nGC\/MS both in the presence and absence of TMAH so as to study their structural characteristics [123].  29 \nResults indicated that considerable amounts of functionalized compounds are bound to the 30 \nmacromolecular structure via ester and ether linkages.  Petsch et al. analysed the weathering profiles of 31 \norganic carbon-rich black shales in order to determine the loss and degradation of organic matter 32 \nduring weathering and its role in the geochemical carbon cycle [124].  A model for kerogen weathering 33 \nwas suggested involving non-selective oxidation and hydration followed by cleavage\/dissolution of 34 \noxidized kerogen fragments.  The chemical structure, source(s), and formation pathway(s) of kerogen-35 \nlike organic matter in sediments from the northwestern Black Sea has also been investigated [125], as 36 \nwell as the molecular structure of kerogens from source rocks of the Tarim Basin [126].  A review of 37 \npyrolysis techniques in the molecular characterisation of environmental kerogen and humic substances 38 \nand their application to geochemistry has been published by Yamamoto et al. [127]. 39 \n Another area of geochemical research which has been greatly explored includes the compositional 40 \nanalysis of coal materials.  The release behaviour of hydrocarbon components of pulverized coal has 41 \nbeen investigated using Py-GC [128], as have the pyrolyzates of raw vitrinites and their residues from 42 \nselected coal samples following a novel binary solvent extraction procedure [129].  The co-pyrolysis of 43 \ncoal and petroleum residues has been studied by Suelves et al. in an attempt to examine the synergetic 44 \neffects on the yield of the main petrochemical pyrolysis products [130], and the structural 45 \ncharacterisation of oil and coal tars using pyrolysis techniques have also been reported [131,132].  46 \nOther studies include the analysis of byproducts resulting from the combustion of coal, such as flyash 47 \n[133]. 48 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \n Additional research using Py-GC includes the study of both volatile and involatile organic 1 \ncompounds in extraterrestrial environments during planetary missions [134], and the examination of 2 \ncuticles from fossil arthropods [135]. 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n4.6 Synthetic polymers 6 \n 7 \n Py-GC has developed considerably to become a routine tool for the identification and differentiation 8 \nof synthetic polymers as well as the quantitative determination of monomers in copolymers.  A great 9 \ndeal of research is now focused on the detection of low level chemical compounds in the polymers. 10 \nThere are many publications on this application of Py-GC however here only a brief overview is 11 \npresented. Many examples have already been provided throughout the scope of this review, but the 12 \nmost frequently analysed synthetic products include plastics, rubbers, coatings and composites.  The 13 \ndevelopments in analytical techniques for the analysis of polyolefins with respect to molar mass and 14 \nchemical composition distribution have been addressed by Pasch [136].  A very recent study on the 15 \ncomposition and microstructure of ethylene and propylene copolymers using Py-GC found it to be a 16 \nvery reliable and reproducible method [137].  Future developments regarding the technique were 17 \nsuggested, including the development of a novel pyrolysis and two-dimensional GC system (Py-GC \u00d7 18 \nGC) which would further improve accuracy by facilitating enhanced separation of pyrolyzates and thus 19 \ngreatly reducing detection interferences.  Wampler et al. have demonstrated a Py-GC\/MS method from 20 \nwhich monomer ratios in random and block copolymers of polyolefins, especially polyethylene and 21 \npolypropylene can be obtained [138], and Evans et al. report an approach for the structural analysis of 22 \npolyester thermosets [139].  The chemical composition of multicomponent acrylic resins, including 23 \nethyl acrylate-butyl methacrylate copolymers and ethyl acrylate-styrene-ethyl methacrylate terpolymers 24 \nhas been assayed [140], as well as the quantitative determination of poly(ethylacrylate-25 \nmethylmethacrylate) layers on drug granules for pharmaceutical use [141].  The compositional and 26 \nmicrostructural determination of water-based synthetic polymers in a latex system using a pre-pyrolysis 27 \nderivatization step has also been described [142].  Furthermore, Learner analyzed the synthetic 28 \npolymers used in the formulation of paints such as alkyd, polyvinyl acetate and nitrocellulose [143], 29 \nand many authors have studied the pyrolysis patterns of rubbers using Py-GC [144], including Choi 30 \nwho assayed styrene-butadiene rubbers with differing microstructures [145]. 31 \n 32 \n 33 \n4.6.1 Detection of additives and contaminants 34 \n 35 \n Compounds added to polymeric materials in order to alter their physical or chemical properties in 36 \nsome way consist of fillers, pigments, antioxidants, stabilizers, flame retardants, plasticisers, lubricants, 37 \npreservatives and other modifiers [74].  The effect additives have on the thermal degradation properties 38 \nof a polymer has already been addressed.  The determination of low level polymer additives in complex 39 \npyrograms is a subject briefly discussed by Wang in his earlier review on Py-GC [2], and despite 40 \nseveral studies published since then, analytical development in this area has been slow.  The key to the 41 \nsuccessful analysis of additives is to understand the properties they possess and to have knowledge of 42 \nthe polymers and their applications.  Volatile and semi-volatile additives can usually be extracted from 43 \nthe matrix and analysed independently using GC methods.  A fast Py-GC method has been described 44 \nfor the qualitative identification of plastic additives from samples of recycled and pure acrylonitrile-45 \nbutadiene-styrene (ABS) originating from electronic waste [146].  The method combines the 46 \nadvantages of thermal desorption and flash pyrolysis by using a novel double-shot pyrolyzer; the low 47 \nmolecular weight additives are desorbed before the polymer chain undergoes decomposition. 48 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \n More complex additives however cannot be extracted, and so pyrolysis of both the additive and the 1 \npolymer must occur simultaneously.  Identification of the pure additive is dependent upon careful 2 \ninterpretation of the intricate array of peaks present on the pyrogram and making distinctions between 3 \npeaks which are chemically or chromatographically different.  Recent investigations have found the 4 \nselective ion monitoring mode of MS detectors to be the most informative approach in this case as it 5 \nimmediately simplifies the identification process [74].   Wang has published a series of papers 6 \nanalyzing several types of polymer additives, namely plasticizers, flame retardants, lubricants and 7 \nantioxidants, in order to demonstrate the utility of Py-GC as a good tool for the characterisation of such 8 \npolymeric systems [147-150].  The advantages of using Py-GC in each case have been discussed.  9 \nYang et al. investigated the effects of different inorganic fillers on the natural photo-oxidation 10 \ndegradation of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) using Py-GC\/MS [151].  Results showed that whilst 11 \nsome fillers, e.g. CaCo3 and wollastonite, stabilized HDPE a little, other inorganic fillers including 12 \nkaolin, diatomite and mica, accelerated the degradation.  In an interesting application Py-GC was used 13 \nto analyse the ABS plastic material used to make faulty Takata press release buttons in automobile seat 14 \nbelts, to determine if a UV stabilizer had been added [152].  A UV stabilizer was detected and validated 15 \nusing mass spectrometry. 16 \n Additives are also incorporated into natural polymers for the same reasons as they are added to 17 \nsynthetic polymers and they can be detected using the same methods.  Techniques for applying internal 18 \nstandards for the quantification of typical chemical paper additives using Py-GC with mass selective 19 \ndetection have been suggested and demonstrated by Odermatt et al [153].  Zhu and co-workers studied 20 \nthe pyrolysis products of cotton and flame retardant cotton fabrics in an attempt to understand their 21 \nthermal degradation mechanisms and thus the fire-resisting functions of the materials [154]. 22 \n 23 \n 24 \n4.7 Forensic 25 \n 26 \n Pyrolysis-GC is a well established technique in forensic analysis often used by forensic chemists to 27 \nanalyse a vast array of polymeric materials.  The literature available is therefore extensive and it 28 \nincludes many different applications.  Certainly one of the most investigated areas is document 29 \nanalysis, including the classification and differentiation of photocopy toners and the analysis of inks.  30 \nStudies on the examination of machine copier toners using Py-GC date back to the 1980\u2019s.  31 \nZimmerman et al. analysed thirty-five different photocopy toners and respective machine copied 32 \ndocuments in an attempt to establish a library of spectra from which an unknown toner extracted from a 33 \nquestioned document may be matched [155].  Levy and Wampler used Py-GC\/MS to analyze a variety 34 \nof photocopies produced by different manufacturers of copying instruments and found specific 35 \nchemical differences in the toner materials used in each make of copier [156].  Similarly, Munson 36 \nseparated photocopy toner material from photocopies from 62 different machines into 18 classes 37 \ndepending on the presence or absence of peaks in the pyrograms [157] and Chang et al. described a Py-38 \nGC\/FID method for the differentiation of photocopier toners using a Curie-point pyrolyzer and a 39 \ncomputer-assisted library search method [158].  A less damaging technique for the identification of 40 \nblack toner material using Py-GC with mass selective detection has also been reported involving the 41 \nheat transfer of the toner from the paper to a medium [159].  More recent work includes the forensic 42 \ndiscrimination of photocopy and printer toners using multivariate statistics [160], and a study of 43 \nsolvents in inkjet printings which found varying proportions of different solvents in different inks 44 \n[161].  A review on chromatographic and electrophoretic applications in ink analysis and the 45 \ncomponents of different types of inks has been published [162]. 46 \n Besides photocopy toners and ink, the forensic analysis of packaging tapes and the adhesives is 47 \nanother area in which literature is readily available.  The identification of trace amounts of synthetic 48 \nadhesives has been achieved by Li et al. who incorporated simultaneous methylation in order to 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \nmeasure the polar compounds [163].  Sakayanagi et al. used Py-GC\/MS to identify 20 different 1 \nproducts of colourless, transparent, pressure-sensitive adhesive polypropylene tapes, the results of 2 \nwhich proved it to be such an effective method that it was applied to the analysis of a real forensic 3 \nsample [164].  Furthermore, the deteriorated rubber-based pressure sensitive adhesives of three 4 \npackaging tapes were analysed by Kumooka who determined that tackifiers including Coumarone 5 \nresins, aromatic petroleum resins and \u03b2-pinene resins have higher resistance to oxidation than natural 6 \nrubbers and aliphatic petroleum resins, and can still be identified by Py-GC\/MS even after the 7 \ndeterioration [165].  A multi-step analysis of packaging tape has also been reported by using a 8 \nPyroprobe 5150 model which can be programmed to take the same sample material to a variety of 9 \ntemperatures automatically [166]. 10 \n Py-GC has long been recognized as a standard method for the forensic analysis of other materials as 11 \nwell.  Several papers have described methods for the identification and differentiation of automotive 12 \npaint samples [167,168], and for the analysis of fibers [169].  Drugs and their metabolites have also 13 \nbeen investigated, including a study by Takayasu and Ohshima who devised a Py-GC\/MS method for 14 \nthe rapid analysis of methamphetamine and its analogs [170].  Another study proposed a protocol for 15 \nthe forensic detection and analysis of condom and personal lubricants in sexual assault cases [171,172].  16 \nFurther applications of Py-GC in the field of forensic medicine and toxicology include the postmortem 17 \nalcohol analysis of the synovial fluid and its availability as a biological specimen for the prediction of 18 \nblood alcohol concentration and urine alcohol concentration in medico-legal cases [173], and the rapid 19 \nanalysis of pesticide components in blood and urine [174]. 20 \n 21 \n 22 \n5. Miscellaneous 23 \n 24 \n Future developments regarding Py-GC as a technique have been suggested.  In their work on the 25 \ncomposition and microstructure of synthetic copolymers, Wang et al. discussed the development of a 26 \nnovel pyrolysis and comprehensive two-dimensional GC system (GC \u00d7 GC) designed to further 27 \nimprove the accuracy achieved using conventional GC methods by facilitating enhanced separation of 28 \npyrolyzates [137].  Based on orthogonal separation principles, comprehensive GC \u00d7 GC relies on a 29 \nconfiguration comprising of two columns displaying different separation characteristics.  The entire 30 \nsample is first separated on a normal-bore capillary column under programmed temperature conditions.  31 \nThe effluent is then modulated and each subsequent small portion of eluate is refocused and re-injected 32 \nonto the second column for further separation. As a result, the resolving power of the chromatograph is 33 \nincreased by over a factor of ten and the probability of coeluting compounds or detection interferences 34 \nis greatly reduced.  Comprehensive GC \u00d7 GC not only simplifies sample preparation procedures but 35 \nalso provides higher sensitivity making it extremely well suited for the analysis of complex 36 \npyrolyzates.  The advantages of this system have been demonstrated in a study by Parsi et al. who used 37 \nnon-discriminating pyrolysis combined with conventional GC\/MS and comprehensive GC \u00d7 GC\/TOF-38 \nMS to analyse the organic fraction of airborne particulate matter (PM) [69].  Whilst results obtained 39 \nusing conventional GC\/MS provided insufficient chromatographic resolution to enable identification of 40 \nPM volatiles and semi-volatiles due to many coelutions, those obtained using comprehensive GC \u00d7 41 \nGC\/TOF-MS showed a dramatic improvement in analyte separation and thus identification. 42 \n Other instrumental techniques involving pyrolysis without the GC separation step also exist but are 43 \nbeyond the scope of this review.  Both direct pyrolysis mass spectrometry (DPMS) and direct pyrolysis 44 \nfourier transform infrared spectrometry (DP\/FTIR) involve the direct interfacing of the pyrolysis device 45 \nto the detector.  In both cases, the technique has been used in polymer analysis as a quick way of 46 \nidentifying primary degradation products which avoid secondary pyrolysis reactions, with minimal 47 \nsample preparation.  With DPMS, pyrolysis occurs under high vacuum and the readily volatilised 48 \npyrolyzates are immediately ionised and detected, preventing further thermal degradation.  This 49 \n Journal of Chromatography A 1186 (2008) 51-66   \ntechnique has been used in a number of studies in order to obtain characteristic information much faster 1 \nand to study the primary degradation pathways of polymers [175-181].  With DP\/FTIR, the pyrolysis 2 \ninstrument (usually a platinum coil Pyroprobe) is designed to fit into the sample compartment of a 3 \nstandard FTIR detector with the use of a specially designed interface.  The filament of the Pyroprobe is 4 \nplaced directly in the light path so that upon pyrolysis, the volatile pyrolyzates diffuse immediately into 5 \nthe beam where they are detected.  Rapid analysis in the beam eliminates any chance of condensation.  6 \nDP\/FTIR is therefore a fast and easy method of obtaining a wide range of information on polymeric 7 \nmaterials.  Several studies have demonstrated its potential [182-184]. 8 \n 9 \n 10 \n6. Conclusion 11 \n 12 \n Py-GC has evolved to become a routine analytical tool for the characterisation and differentiation of 13 \npolymers, both natural and synthetic.  Since 1999, several types of thermal analysis equipment have 14 \nbeen developed to improve the analytical scope of Py-GC.  Besides conventional pyrolyzers, the 15 \nintroduction of laser pyrolysis has become a new phenomenon for Py-GC.  Laser energy used as a 16 \nfragmentation source has facilitated controlled pyrolysis of specific regions on a sample, providing 17 \nuseful data on the molecular compositional units of macromolecules in situ.  The very recent 18 \ndevelopment of a non-discriminating Py-GC system has been designed to overcome the problems 19 \nassociated with traditional pyrolyzers relating to sample losses and discrimination of high-molecular 20 \nweight compounds.  Having already been used in a range of applications it offers great potential for the 21 \nfuture analysis of macromolecular structures.  Furthermore, the development of a novel double-shot 22 \npyrolyzer incorporating both thermal desorption and flash pyrolysis, has become a useful instrument 23 \nfor the fast identification of low molecular weight polymer additives.  Future developments in Py-GC 24 \ntechnology have also been suggested, which include the use of comprehensive GC \u00d7 GC for the 25 \nenhanced separation and detection of pyrolyzates. 26 \n 27 \n7.
