We concentrate on Higgs production via central exclusive diffractive processes (CEDP).\nParticular attention is paid to regions in the MSSM parameter space where the partial width of the Higgs\nboson decay into two gluons much exceeds the SM case; here the CEDP are found to have special advantages.\n1 Introduction\nThe Higgs sector is (so far) an elusive basic ingredient of the fundamental theory of particle interactions.\nSearches for Higgs bosons, and the study of their properties, are one of the primary goals of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at CERN, which is scheduled to commence taking data in the year 2007. The conventional\nfolklore is that (under reasonable model assumptions) at least one Higgs boson should be discovered at the\nLHC. In particular, if the light Higgs predicted by the Standard Model (SM) exists1, it will almost certainly\nbe found at the LHC in the first years of running or even maybe before, at the Tevatron. Moreover the LHC\nshould provide a complete coverage of the SM Higgs mass range.\nHowever there is a strong belief that the Standard Model, in its minimal form with a single Higgs, cannot be\nthe fundamental theory of particle interactions. Various extended models predict a large diversity of Higgs-like\nbosons with different masses, couplings and even CP-parities. The most elaborated extension of the Standard\nModel is, currently, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in which there are three neutral (h,\nH and A) and two charged (H+, H\u2212) Higgs bosons, where h and H are CP-even (mh < mH) and A is CP-odd.\n1The theoretical progress in the calculations of the signal and background processes has been enormous in recent years, reaching\nan accuracy of the next-to-next-to-leading QCD corrections for some relevant cross sections, see for example [1] and references\ntherein. At the same time, experimentally related issues of the Higgs search physics have been thoroughly investigated, see for\nexample [2].\nJust as for the Standard Model, this benchmark SUSY model has been studied in great detail; for a recent review\nsee [3]. In the MSSM, the properties of the Higgs sector are characterized by the values of two independent\ninput parameters, typically chosen to be the pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, mA, and the ratio, tan\u03b2, of the\nvacuum-expectation-values of the two Higgs doublet fields. At tree level, the pseudoscalar A does not couple to\nthe gauge bosons and its couplings to down- (up-) type fermions are (inversely) proportional to tan\u03b2. Within\nthe MSSM, the mass of the h-boson is bounded to mh <\u223c 135 GeV (see, for example, [4] and references therein),\nwhile the experimental 95% CL lower limit for a neutral scalar Higgs is mh \u2243 mA \u223c 92 GeV [5].\nBeyond the Standard Model the properties of the neutral Higgs bosons can differ drastically from SM\nexpectations. In some extended models, the limit for a neutral Higgs can go down to below 60 GeV. This\noccurs, for instance in the MSSM with explicit CP-violation, where the mass eigenstates of the neutral Higgs\nbosons do not match the CP eigenstates h,H,A, see, for example, [6]. Further examples are the models with\nextra dimensions where a Higgs can mix with the graviscalar of the Randall\u2013Sundrum scenario [7], which is\ncalled the radion (see for example [8]). In the latter case, due to the trace anomaly, the gluon\u2013gluon coupling is\nstrongly enhanced, which makes this graviscalar especially attractive for searches in gluon-mediated processes,\nassuming that the background issues can be overcome. These extended scenarios would complicate the study\nof the neutral Higgs sector using the conventional (semi)inclusive strategies.\nAfter the discovery of a Higgs candidate the immediate task will be to establish its quantum numbers,\nto verify the Higgs interpretation of the signal, and to make precision measurements of its properties. The\nseparation and identification of different Higgs-like states will be especially challenging. It will be an even more\ndelicate goal to establish the nature of a newly-discovered heavy resonance state. For example, how can one\ndiscriminate between the Higgs of the extended SUSY sector from the graviscalar of the Randall\u2013Sundrum\nscenario (or, even worse, from a mixture of the Higgs and the radion). As was shown in [9], the central exclusive\ndiffractive processes (CEDP) at the LHC can play a crucial role in solving these problems, which are so vital\nfor the Higgs physics. These processes are of the form\npp\u2192 p+ \u03c6+ p, (1)\nwhere the + signs denote the rapidity gaps on either side of the Higgs-like state \u03c6. They have unique advantages\nas compared to the traditional non-diffractive approaches [10, 11]. These processes allow the properties of \u03c6 to\nbe studied in an environment in which there are no secondaries from the underlying events. In particular, if the\nforward protons are tagged, then the mass of the produced central system \u03c6 can be measured to high accuracy\nby the missing mass method. Indeed, by observing the forward protons, as well as the \u03c6 \u2192 bb\u00af pairs in the\ncentral detector, one can match two simultaneous measurements of the \u03c6 mass: m\u03c6 = \u2206mmissing andm\u03c6 = mbb\u00af.\nMoreover, proton taggers allow the damaging effects of multiple interactions per bunch crossing (pile-up) to\nbe suppressed and hence offer the possibility of studying CEDP processes at higher luminosities [11]. Thus\nthe prospects of the precise mass determination of the Higgs-like states, and even of the direct measurements\nof their widths and \u03c6 \u2192 bb\u00af couplings, looks feasible using these processes. A promising option is to use the\nforward proton taggers as a spin-parity analyser [9]. This may provide valuable additional (and in some cases\nunique) information in the unambiguous identification of a newly discovered state.\nIn Section 2 we illustrate the advantages of CEDP, (1), in exploring the Higgs sector in specific parameter\nranges of the MSSM. First in Section 2.1 we consider the so-called \u201cintense-coupling\u201d regime [12, 13] where the\n\u03b3\u03b3, WW \u22c6 and ZZ\u22c6 Higgs decay modes are suppressed but where, on the other hand, the CEDP cross section\nis enhanced, in comparison with the SM. Next, in Section 2.2, we discuss the decoupling limit (mA > 2MZ,\ntan\u03b2 > 5) where the light scalar, h, looks very similar to the SM Higgs. In this case the discovery of the heavier\nscalar H is crucial to establish the underlying structure of the electroweak-symmetry-breaking dynamics. If\nmH < 250 GeV, then the H boson may be observed and studied in CEDP. In Section 2.3 we show that CEDP\nmay cover the \u201cwindows\u201d where, once the h boson is discovered, it is not possible to disentangle the H or A\nbosons by traditional means. In Section 3 we explain how studies of CEDP may help to determine the properties\nof the Higgs-like states, once they have been discovered.\nThe plan of the paper is first to present the predictions and then, in Section 4, to explain how the cross\nsections for the CEDP of the \u03c6 CP-even and CP-odd Higgs states are calculated. In this Section we also\nenumerate the uncertainties in the predictions. Simple formulae to approximate the CEDP cross sections for\n2\npp \u2192 p + \u03c6 + p with \u03c6 \u2192 bb\u00af, and the corresponding QCD bb\u00af background, are given in Section 5. These allow\nquick, reliable estimates to be made of the signal-to-background ratio for a Higgs of any mass, and both CP\nparities.\nIn Section 6 we focus attention on ways to identify the pseudoscalar boson A. It is unlikely that the pure\nexclusive diffractive production process will have sufficient events, and so possible semi-inclusive signals are\nproposed and studied.\n2 Discovery potential of diffractive processes\nThe main aim of this paper is to show how the Higgs discovery potential at the LHC may be enlarged by using\nthe unique advantages of forward proton tagging. Special attention is paid to the cases where the partial widths\nfor the decay of Higgs bosons into two gluons greatly exceed the SM values. As mentioned above, we shall\nillustrate the advantages of using forward proton tagging to study the Higgs sector by giving predictions for a\nfew examples within the MSSM model.\n2.1 The intense coupling regime\nThe \u201cintense-coupling regime\u201d [12, 13] is where the masses of all three neutral Higgs bosons are close to each\nother and the value of tan\u03b2 is large. Then the \u03b3\u03b3,WW \u22c6, ZZ\u22c6 decay modes (which are among the main\ndetection modes for the SM Higgs) are strongly suppressed. This is the regime where the variations of all\nMSSM Higgs masses and couplings are very rapid. This region is considered as one of the most challenging for\nthe (conventional) Higgs searches at the LHC, see [13] and references therein. On the other hand, here the CEDP\ncross sections are enhanced by more than an order of magnitude (due to the large gg \u2192 \u03c6 couplings). Therefore\nthe expected significance of the CEDP signal becomes quite large. Indeed, this is evident from Fig. 1, which\nshows the cross sections for the CEDP production of h,H,A bosons as functions of their mass for tan\u03b2 = 30\nand 50. The cross sections are computed as described in Section 5, with the widths and properties of the Higgs\nscalar (h,H) and pseudoscalar (A) bosons obtained from the HDECAY code, version 3.0 [15], with all other\nparameters taken from Table 2 of [15]; also we take IMODEL = 4, which means the radiative corrections are\nincluded according to Ref. [16].\nLet us focus on the main \u03c6\u2192 bb\u00af decay mode2. This mode is well suited for CEDP studies, since a P -even,\nJz = 0 selection rule [18, 19, 20] suppresses the QCD bb\u00af background at LO. Indeed, at the LHC, the signal-\nto-background ratio is S\/B \u223c 3 for a Standard Model Higgs boson of mass m = 120 GeV, if the experimental\ncuts and efficiencies quoted in [11] are used. This favourable ratio was obtained since it was argued that proton\ntaggers can achieve a missing mass resolution of \u2206mmissing \u2243 1 GeV. Due to the enhancement of the production\nof MSSM scalars, for large tan\u03b2, the QCD background becomes practically negligible. Note that, normally,\nto estimate the statistical significance of the measurement of the signal cross section, we use the conservative\nformula\n\u221a\nS +B for the statistical error. However when we are looking for a new particle, which gives some peak\non the top of the background, the statistical error may be much lower. It is given just by the fluctuation of the\nbackground \u2013\n\u221a\nB. On the other hand for a low number of events, it is appropriate to use a Poisson, rather than\na Gaussian, distribution. Thus the statistical significance to discover a new particle has to be evaluated more\nprecisely. For instance, with the cuts and efficiencies quoted in [11], we estimate that the QCD background is B\n= 40(4) events for an integrated luminosity of L = 300 fb\u22121 (30 fb\u22121), if we take M = 120 GeV and \u2206M = 1\nGeV. Thus, to obtain a confidence coefficient of 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22127 (equivalent to a statistical significance of 5\u03c3 for a\nGaussian distribution[21]), it is sufficient for the cross section of a Higgs signal, times the bb\u00af branching fraction,\nto satisfy\nBr(bb\u00af) \u00b7 \u03c3 > 0.7 fb (2.7 fb) (2)\n2The exclusive diffractive studies in Ref. [11] addressed mainly the bb\u00af decay mode. The use of the \u03c4\u03c4 decay mode requires\nan evaluation of the pp \u2192 p + \u03c4\u03c4 + p background, especially of the possibility of misidentifying gluon jets as \u03c4 \u2019s in the CEDP\nenvironment. Currently, for inclusive processes, the probability, P (g\/\u03c4), to misidentify a gluon as a \u03c4 is estimated to be about\n0.002 [17].\n3\nCentral exclusive diffractive production\ntan\u03b2 = 30\n\u03c3 Br(h\/H\u2192bb)  (fb)\nSM\nmh\/H  (GeV)\nh H tan\u03b2 = 50\n\u03c3 Br(h\/H\u2192bb)  (fb)\nSM\nmh\/H  (GeV)\nh H\n\u03c3 Br  (fb)\ntan\u03b2 = 30\nA\u2192bb\nA\u2192\u03c4\u03c4\nmA (GeV)\n\u03c3 Br  (fb)\ntan\u03b2 = 50\nA\u2192bb\nA\u2192\u03c4\u03c4\nmA (GeV)\nFigure 1: The cross sections, times the appropriate bb\u00af and \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 branching fractions, predicted for central\nexclusive diffractive production of h(0+), H(0+) and A(0\u2212) MSSM Higgs bosons (for tan\u03b2 = 30 and 50) at the\nLHC, obtained using the MRST99 [14] gluon distribution. The dotted curve in the upper plots shows the cross\nsection for the production of a SM Higgs boson. The vertical line separates the mass regime of light h(0+) and\nheavy H(0+) bosons. The curves were computed using version 3.0 of the HDECAY code [15], with all other\nparameters taken from Table 2 of [15]; the radiative corrections were included according to Ref. [16].\nif we take the integrated luminosity to be L = 300 fb\u22121 (30 fb\u22121).\nAs can be seen from Fig. 1, for MSSM with tan\u03b2 = 50 the expected CEDP cross section times branching\nfraction, Br(H \u2192 bb\u00af)\u03c3H , is greater than 0.7fb for masses up to mH \u223c 250 GeV. The situation is worse for\npseudoscalar, A, production, since the cross section is suppressed by the P -even selection rule. Thus the CEDP\nfilters out pseudoscalar production, which allows the possibility to study pure H production, see Fig. 1. This\nmay be also useful in the decoupling limit, to which we now turn.\n2.2 The decoupling limit\nIn the so-called decoupling limit [22], where mA > 2mZ and tan\u03b2 >\u223c 5, the light scalar h becomes indistinguish-\nable from the SM Higgs. The other two neutral Higgs states are comparatively heavy and are approximately\ndegenerate in mass. In this regime the discovery of the heavier non-minimal Higgs scalar H is crucial for estab-\nlishing the underlying structure of the electroweak-symmetry-breaking dynamics. Here, forward proton tagging\ncan play an important role in searching for (at least) the H-boson, if it is not too heavy (mH <\u223c 250 GeV), see\nFig. 1. For illustration, consider the case mH = 150 GeV and tan\u03b2 = 4.5. With an integrated luminosity of\nL = 300 fb\u22121, the CEDP cross section of\nBr(H \u2192 bb\u00af)\u03c3H = 0.8 fb (3)\ngives about 40 events, after applying the experimental cuts and efficiencies discussed in Ref. [11]. The corre-\nsponding background is about 10 events. Thus, if we use a Poisson distribution, as we did in the case of (2),\nthen the expected statistical significance to observe such an H boson will exceed 10\u03c3.\n4\nThe possibility to use exclusive diffractive processes to explore larger masses will depend on various experiment-\nrelated factors. In particular, on the prospects to achieve better mass resolution, \u2206m, at higher mass, m.\n2.3 The \u2018window\u2019 or \u2018hole\u2019 regions\nThere are regions of MSSM parameter space where, after the h boson is discovered, it will be difficult to identify\nthe heavy H or A bosons by conventional non-diffractive processes. Can the CEDP processes help here? First\nconsider the \u2018notorious hole\u2019 in parameter space (sometimes called the \u201cLHC wedge\u201d), defined bymA >\u223c 200 GeV\nand tan\u03b2 \u223c 4\u20137 [3]. In this region, only the lightest Higgs h can be discovered even with integrated luminosity\nof the order of 300 fb\u22121. Its properties are nearly indistinguishable from those of a SM Higgs. Unfortunately\nhere, even for H , the predicted CEDP cross section is too low, assuming the efficiencies and cuts of Ref. [11];\nsee the heavy continuous curve in Fig. 2.\ntan\u03b2 = 6\ntan\u03b2 = 4.5\n\u03c3 Br(h\/H\u2192bb)  (fb)\nh\nH\nmh\/H  (GeV)\nmA= 130 - 200 - 240 GeV\nmA= 130 - 170 GeV\nFigure 2: The cross sections for the central exclusive diffractive production of h andH bosons, pp\u2192 p+(h,H)+p,\ntimes the appropriate bb\u00af branching fraction, as a function of their mass, in two regions of MSSM parameter\nspace where observation of the H using non-diffractive processes is difficult. Note that in the first region the\ncurve changes from dotted to continuous when the mass of the A(0\u2212) bosons reaches 200 GeV; and that the\nvalue of mh is practically unchanged for values of mA in the region mA > 200 GeV.\nHowever, with the present understanding of the capabilities of the detectors it is plausible that similar\nwindows will occur in the interval 130 <\u223c mA <\u223c 170 GeV for tan\u03b2 \u22434\u20136.3 That is, it may be impossible to identify\nthe H scalar by conventional processes at the 5\u03c3 confidence level with 300 fb\u22121 of combined ATLAS+CMS\nluminosity. From the predictions shown by the dashed line in Fig. 2, we see that the part of this \u2018hole\u2019, up to\nmH \u223c 160 GeV, may be covered by CEDP.\n3We are grateful to Sasha Nikitenko for pointing out the importance of the additional (nonconventional) studies in this region.\n5\n2.4 Exotic scenarios\nRecently some interesting applications of the CEDP to studies of the more exotic Higgs scenarios, such as\nmodels with CP violation and searches for the radions, have been discussed [23]. However the feasibility of\napplying these studies will require further critical discussion of the background issues.\n3 Potential of diffractive processes after a Higgs discovery\nAs was discussed in Refs. [11, 9], the use of CEDP, with forward proton tagging, can provide a competitive way\nto detect a Higgs boson. This approach appears to have special advantages for searches of the CP-even Higgses\nof MSSM in the intense-coupling regime. Indeed, the CEDP cross section can exceed the SM result by more\nthan an order of magnitude, see Fig. 1. Once a Higgs-like signal is observed, it will be extremely important\nto verify that it is indeed a Higgs boson. Here we describe where forward proton tagging can provide valuable\nhelp to establish the nature of the newly discovered state and to verify whether it can be interpreted as a Higgs\nboson. We also emphasize that CEDP are well suited to study specific cases which pose difficulties for probing\nthe Higgs sector at the LHC.\nIt is generally believed that a detailed coverage of the Higgs sector will require complementary research\nprogrammes at the LHC and a Linear e+e\u2212 collider. Interestingly, in some sense, the implementation of\nforward proton taggers allows some studies which otherwise would have to await the construction of a Linear\ne+e\u2212 collider. Moreover, in addition to the other advantages, forward proton tagging offers the possibility to\nstudy New Physics in the photon\u2013photon collisions, see for example [24, 25, 26, 10].\nAs mentioned above, if a candidate Higgs signal is detected it will be a challenging task to prove its Higgs\nidentity. Unlike the conventional inclusive approaches, the very fact of seeing the resonance state in CEDP\nautomatically implies that the newly discovered state has the following fundamental properties. It must have zero\nelectric charge and be a colour singlet. Furthermore, assuming P and C conservation, the dominantly produced\nstate has a positive natural parity, P = (\u22121)J and even CP. Recall that the installation of forward proton\ntaggers also allows the attractive possibility of a spin-parity analysis. This may provide valuable additional\n(and in some cases unique) leverage in establishing the origin of the discovered candidate state. In particular,\nassuming CP conservation, the CEDP allow the 0\u2212, 1\u2212, 1+ states to be filtered out, leaving only an ambiguity\nbetween the 0++ and 2++ states. Though without further efforts the 2++ state cannot be ruled out, this would\nnot be the most likely choice.\nAs discussed in [9], studying of the azimuthal correlations of the outgoing protons can allow further spin-\nparity analysis. In particular, it may be possible to isolate the 0\u2212 state. The azimuthal distribution distinguishes\nbetween the production of scalar and pseudoscalar particles [9]. Note that with the forward protons we can\ndetermine the CP-properties of the Higgs boson irrespective of the decay mode. Moreover, CEDP allow the\nobservation of the interference effects between the CP-even and CP-odd gg \u2192 \u03c6 transitions (see [27]).\nFollowing the discovery, and the determination of the basic quantum numbers, of the new state, the next\nstep is to check whether the coupling properties match those expected for the Higgs boson. For this, we need\nto detect the signal in at least two different channels. The CEDP mechanism provides an excellent opportunity\n4 to detect the bb\u00af mode. The other decay channel which is appropriate for CEDP studies is the \u03c4\u03c4 decay mode\n(or WW \u22c6, or \u00b5\u00b5, if the event rate is sufficient). These measurements allow a non-trivial check of the theoretical\nmodels. For example, the precise measurement of the partial decay widths into tau and bottom quark pairs can\nprovide a way to discriminate between supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric Higgs sectors, and to probe\nCP-violating effects (for recent papers see, for instance, [28] and references therein).\nFor illustration, consider the following topical example, namely the intense coupling limit of MSSM. As\nmentioned before, this regime is especially difficult for conventional inclusive studies of the MSSM Higgs [12, 13].\nOn the other hand, with forward proton taggers, CEDP offer an ideal probe.\nFor numerical purposes, we choose the same parameters as in [13], in particular, tan\u03b2 = 30, together with\nresults for tan\u03b2 = 50. The salient features of this regime are that there is almost a mass degeneracy of the neutral\nHiggs states, and their total widths can be quite large (due to the tan2 \u03b2 increase) and reach up to 1\u20132 GeV.\n4Recall that for more inclusive processes the signal is overwhelmed by the QCD bb\u00af background.\n6\nThis can be seen from Fig. 3, where we plot the mass differences \u2206M = mA \u2212mh and \u2206M = mH \u2212mA, and\nthe widths of the bosons, as a function of the pseudoscalar mass mA.

The lower plots show the total widths\nof the MSSM neutral high bosons.\nHiggs bosons in the region around mA \u223c 130 GeV, where all three neutral Higgs states practically overlap [13].\nSince the traditional non-diffractive approaches do not, with the exception of the \u03b3\u03b3 and \u00b5\u00b5 modes, provide a\nmass resolution better than 10\u201320 GeV, all three Higgs bosons will appear as one resonance5.\nAs an example, we give the expected number of CEDP signal and background events for L = 30 fb\u22121 for\nmA = 130 GeV, using the efficiencies and angular cuts adopted in Ref. [11]. For tan\u03b2 = 30(50), the number of\nthe A\u2192 bb\u00af signal events, SA = 0.35(1), while the QCD background is B = 2.5 for \u2206M = 1 GeV. For this choice\nof parameters, mh = 122.7(124.4) GeV, and the number of the h\u2192 bb\u00af events is Sh = 30(71) with background\nB = 3.5(3.2). The corrresponding numbers for the H boson are mH = 134.2(133.5) GeV, SH = 47(124) and\nB = 2.1.\nAn immediate advantage of CEDP, for studying this troublesome region, is that the A contribution is\nstrongly suppressed, while the h and H states can be well separated (mH\u2212mh \u2243 10 GeV) given the anticipated\nexperimental mass resolution of \u2206M \u223c 1 GeV [11], see Fig. 4. Note that precision measurements of the two\nCP-even Higgs states may allow a direct determination of the basic MSSM parameter, tan\u03b2.\nMoreover, the forward tagging approach can provide a direct measurement of the width6 of the h (for\nmh <\u223c 120 GeV) and the H-boson (for mH >\u223c 130 GeV). Outside the narrow range mA = 130 \u00b1 5 GeV, the\n5Recall that in this regime the \u03b3\u03b3 decay mode is hopeless. Moreover, the vector-boson-fusion Higgs production, with the bb\u00af or\n\u03c4\u03c4 decays, does not allow the separation of the h and H peaks due to the poor invariant mass resolution. As shown in [13], only the\ndetection of the rare dimuon Higgs decay mode may provide a chance to separate the Higgs states in inclusive production. Even\nthis would require that the Higgs mass splitting exceeds at 3\u20135 GeV.\n6Note that, strictly speaking, when the Higgs width, \u0393, becomes comparable to the mass resolution, \u2206m, the zero-width\napproximation is not valid any more. Therefore in calculations of the cross sections the mass resolution and large-width effects\nshould be taken into account.\n7\ntan\u03b2 = 30\nm\u03c6 \u00b1 \u0393  (GeV)\nmA  (GeV)\nh\nH\nA\ntan\u03b2 = 30\nm\u03c6 \u00b1 \u0393  (GeV)\nmA  (GeV)\nh\nH\ntan\u03b2 = 50\nm\u03c6 \u00b1 \u0393  (GeV)\nmA  (GeV)\nh\nH\nA\ntan\u03b2 = 12\nm\u03c6 \u00b1 \u0393  (GeV)\nmA  (GeV)\nh\nH\nA\nFigure 4: The mass bands m\u03c6 \u00b1 \u0393 for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons as a function of mA, for different values of\ntan\u03b2. A vertical slice through these plots, at a given value ofmA, indicates the position of the MSSM resonance\nHiggs peaks. The upper right hand plot shows that the h and H bosons are clearly identifiable for tan\u03b2 = 30, if\nA(0\u2212) production is suppressed. The lower plots show how the sensitivity of the widths, to variations of tan\u03b2,\nwill change the profile of the peaks. This way of presentation was motivated by Ref. [13]. Note that the widths\nof the bosons for tan\u03b2 less than about 15 become barely visible on this type of plot.\nwidths of the h and H are quite different (one is always much narrower than the other), see Fig. 3. Recall\nthat the width measurement can play an important role in the understanding of Higgs dynamics. It would be\ninstructive to observe this phenomenon experimentally.\nAs discussed in [9], for tan\u03b2 = 30 the central exclusive signal should be still accessible at the LHC up to an\nH mass about 250 GeV. For instance, for mH = 210 GeV, and LHC luminosity 30 fb\n\u22121 (300 fb\u22121), about 20\n(200) H \u2192 bb\u00af events are produced. If the experimental cuts and efficiencies quoted in DKMOR are imposed,\nthen the signal is depleted by about a factor of 6. This leaves 3 (30) observable events, with background of\nabout 0.1 (1) events.\n4 Calculation of the 0\u00b1 Higgs cross sections and their uncertainties\nTo calculate the cross section for the central exclusive diffractive production of h(0\u00b1) Higgs bosons7 we use the\nformalism of Refs. [29, 20, 10]. The amplitudes are described by the diagram shown in Fig. 5(a), where the hard\nsubprocesses gg \u2192 h(0\u00b1) are initiated by gluon\u2013gluon fusion and where the second t-channel gluon is needed\nto screen the colour flow across the rapidity gap intervals.

Below, we assume factorization of\nthe unintegrated distributions,\nfg(x, x\n\u2032, Q2, \u00b52; t) = fg(x, x\n\u2032, Q2, \u00b52)FN (t), (9)\nwhere we parameterize the form factor of the proton vertex by the form FN (t) = exp(bt) with b = 2 GeV\n\u22122. In\nthe domain specified by (8) the skewed unintegrated densities are given in terms of the conventional (integrated)\ndensities g(x,Q2i ). To single log accuracy, we have [32]\n8.\nfg(x, x\n\u2032, Q2i , \u00b5\n2) = Rg\n\u2202\n\u2202 lnQ2i\n(\u221a\nT (Qi, \u00b5) xg(x,Q\n2\ni )\n)\n, (10)\nwhere T is the usual Sudakov form factor which ensures that the gluon remains untouched in the evolution up\nto the hard scale \u00b5, so that the rapidity gaps survive. This Sudakov factor T is the result of resumming the\nvirtual contributions in the DGLAP evolution. It is given by\nT (Q\u22a5, \u00b5) = exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b \u00b52\nQ2\n\u22a5\n\u03b1S(k\n2\nt )\n2\u03c0\ndk2t\nk2t\n\u222b 1\u2212\u2206\n0\n[\nzPgg(z) +\n\u2211\nq\nPqg(z)\n]\ndz\n)\n. (11)\n8In the actual computations we use a more precise form as given by eq.(26) of Ref.[32]\n9\nHere we wish to go beyond the collinear approximation and in the T factor to resum, not just the single collinear\nlogarithms, but the single soft log 1\/(1\u2212 z) terms as well. Thus we consider the region of large-angle soft gluon\nemission, and explicitly calculate the one-loop vertex diagram. In particular, we do not approximate sin \u03b8 by \u03b8.\nThen we adjust the upper limit of the z integration in (11) to reproduce the complete one-loop result9. We find\n\u2206 =\nkt\nkt + 0.62mh\n. (12)\nThe square root in (10) arises because the bremsstrahlung survival probability T is only relevant to hard gluons.\nRg is the ratio of the skewed x\n\u2032 \u226a x integrated distribution to the conventional diagonal density g(x,Q2). For\nx \u226a 1 it is completely determined [33], with an uncertainty in Rg of the order of 4x2. The apparent infrared\ndivergence of (4) is nullified10 for h(0+) production by the Sudakov factors embodied in the gluon densities fg.\nHowever, as discussed in Ref. [9], the amplitude for h(0\u2212) production is much more sensitive to the infrared\ncontribution. Indeed let us consider the case of small pi\u22a5 of the outgoing protons. Then, from (6), we see\nthat Vh(0+) \u223c Q2\u22a5, whereas Vh(0\u2212) \u223c p1\u22a5p2\u22a5 (since the linear contribution in Q\u22a5 vanishes after the angular\nintegration). Thus the d2Q\u22a5\/Q\n4\n\u22a5\nintegration for h(0+) is replaced by p1\u22a5p2\u22a5d\n2Q\u22a5\/Q\n6\n\u22a5\nfor h(0\u2212), and now the\nSudakov suppression is not enough to prevent a significant contribution from the Q2\n\u22a5\n<\u223c 1 GeV2 domain.\n4.1 Uncertainties in predictions of the cross sections\nTo estimate the uncertainty in the predictions for the h\u00b1(0) exclusive diffractive cross sections we first quantify\nthe above uncertainty arising from the infrared region, where the gluon distribution is not well known. As an\nexample, consider h(0\u2212) and h(0+) production at the LHC, for mh = 120 GeV and \u00b5 = mh\/2, using different\ntreatments of the infrared region. We perform calculations using MRST99 [14] and CTEQ6M [34] partons\nrespectively with the very low Q gluon frozen at its value at Q1,2 = 1.3 GeV. Then we integrate down in Q\u22a5\nuntil Q1,2 are close to \u039bQCD, where the contribution vanishes due to the presence of the T -factor. This will\nslightly overestimate the cross sections, as for x \u223c 0.01 the gluon density has a positive anomalous dimension\n(xg \u223c (Q2)\u03b3 with \u03b3 > 0) and decreases with decreasing Q2. A lower extreme is to remove the contribution\nbelow Q1,2 = 1.3 GeV entirely. Even with this extreme choice, the 0\n+ cross section is not changed greatly; it\nis depleted by about 20%. On the other hand, as anticipated, for 0\u2212 production, the infrared region is much\nmore important and the cut reduces the cross section by a factor of 5.\nAnother uncertainty is the choice of factorization scale \u00b5. Note that in comparison with previous calcu-\nlations [10], which were done in the limit of proton transverse momenta, p1,2\u22a5 \u226a Q\u22a5, now we include the\nexplicit p\u22a5-dependence in the Q\u22a5-loop integral of (4). We resum the \u2018soft\u2019 gluon logarithms, ln 1\/(1 \u2212 z), in\nthe T -factor. So now the T -factor includes both the soft and collinear single logarithms. The only uncertainty\nis the non-logarithmic NLO contribution. This may be modelled by changing the factorization scale, \u00b5, which\nfixes the maximal kt of the gluon in the NLO loop correction. As the default we have used \u00b5 = mh\/2; that is\nthe largest kt allowed in the process with total energy mh. Choosing a lower scale \u00b5 = mh\/4 would enlarge the\ncross sections by about 30%. Recall that the general calculation is performed in the collinear approximation.\nHowever, when we take account of large-angle soft gluon emission in the form factor, that is in the calculation of\nthe virtual-loop correction, as in (11) and (12), we go beyond the collinear approximation. The corresponding\nreal contribution in (10) is represented by Rg and the derivative of the\n\u221a\nT factor. Strictly speaking, for the\ncase of large-angle emission there will be some small deviation from this simplified formula. This gives an extra\nuncertainty of the order of 10%.\nNext there is some uncertainty in the gluon distribution itself. To evaluate this, we compare predictions\nobtained using CTEQ6M [34], MRST99 [14] and MRST02 [35] partons. For 0+ production at the LHC, with\n9An explicit computation of the one-loop vertex contribution from the region of gluon transverse momentum Q\u22a5 \u226a k\u22a5 \u226a mh\/2\ngives (Nc\u03b1S\/\u03c0)[0.212 + ln(mh\/2k\u22a5) \u2212 11\/12]dk\n2\n\u22a5\n\/k2\n\u22a5\n. The last number in the square brackets corresponds to the standard non-\nlogarithmic contribution related to the zPgg(z) term in (11), while the first number stems from the exact treatment of large-angle\ngluon radiation. This result can be incorporated in (11) by simply choosing \u2206 as in (12).\n10In addition, at LHC energies, the effective anomalous dimension of the gluon gives an extra suppression of the contribution\nfrom the low Q\u22a5 domain [30].\n10\nmh = 120 GeV and \u00b5 = mh\/2, we find that the effective gluon\u2013gluon luminosity, before screening, is\ndL\ndyd lnm2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\ny=0\n= (2.2, 1.7, 1.45)\u00d7 10\u22122 (13)\nrespectively. This spread of values arises because the CTEQ gluon is 7% higher, and the MRST02 gluon 4%\nlower, than the default MRST99 gluon, in the relevant kinematic region. The sensitivity to the gluon arises\nbecause the central exclusive diffractive cross section is proportional to the 4th power of the gluon. For 0\u2212\nproduction, the corresponding numbers are (4.2, 2.7, 1.7)\u00d7 10\u22125. Up to now, we have discussed the effective\ngluon\u2013gluon luminosity. However, NNLO corrections may occur in the gg \u2192 h fusion vertex. These give an\nextra uncertainty of \u00b120%. Note that we have already accounted for the NLO corrections for this vertex [10].\nFurthermore, we need to consider the soft rescattering which leads to a rather small probability, S2 = 0.026,\nthat the rapidity gaps survive the soft pp interaction, see Fig. 5(b). From the analysis [36] of all soft pp data\nwe estimate the accuracy of the prediction for S2 is \u00b150%. One check of the eikonal model calculations of S2\nis the estimate of the diffractive dijet production rate measured by the CDF collaboration [37] at the Tevatron.\nThe rate, when calculated using factorization and the diffractive structure functions obtained from HERA data,\nlies about a factor of 10 above the CDF data. However, when rescattering corrections are included, and the\nsurvival probabilities computed, remarkably good agreement with the CDF measurements is obtained [38].\nCombining together all these sources of error we find that the prediction for the 0+ cross section is uncertain\nto a factor of almost 2.5, that is up to almost 2.5, and down almost to 1\/2.5, times the default value.11 On\nthe other hand, 0\u2212 production is uncertain by this factor just from the first (infrared) source of error, with the\nremaining errors contributing almost another factor of 2.5.\n5 Simplified formulae for the CEDP signal and background\nHere we give simple approximate formulae for the cross sections for the central exclusive diffractive production\nof h(0\u00b1) bosons, pp \u2192 p + h + p, and for the QCD bb\u00af background as a function of mass. As was shown in\nRef. [10], the cross section may be written as the product of the effective gluon\u2013gluon luminosity L and the\ncross section for the hard subprocess \u03c3\u02c6\n\u03c3CEDP = L\u03c3\u02c6. (14)\nAt the LHC energy, the luminosity, integrated over rapidity, may be approximated, to an accuracy of better\nthan 10% in the interval 25 < m < 250 GeV, by\ndL\nd lnm2\n=\n\u222b\ndL\ndyd lnm2\ndy =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\n9.1\u00d7 105 \u3008S2\u30090+\n(16 +m)3.3\nfor h(0+) production\n1.94\u00d7 103 \u3008S2\u30090\u2212\n(0.5 +m)3.45\nfor h(0\u2212) production\n(15)\nwhere the mass m is in GeV. The factors \u3008S2\u3009, which are the probability that the rapidity gaps survive the soft\nrescattering, are 0.026 and 0.087 for h(0+) and h(0\u2212) respectively. The 0\u2212 amplitude contains the kinematic\nfactor ~p1\u22a5 \u00d7 ~p2\u22a5, which implies that in impact parameter space the Fourier transform contains the factor\n~b1\u22a5\u00d7~b2\u22a5 [9]. Thus the 0\u2212 amplitude tends to populate larger impact parameters, where the suppression caused\nby soft rescattering is less effective, than does the 0+ amplitude. The gg \u2192 h subprocesses cross section is, in\nthe zero width approximation,\n\u03c3\u02c6h =\n2\u03c02\u0393(h\u2192 gg)\nm3h\n\u03b4\n(\n1\u2212 m\n2\nm2h\n)\n\u223c \u03b12S(m2h)GF , (16)\nwhere GF is the Fermi constant.\nThe bb\u00af background processes were discussed in detail in Ref. [11] for a Standard Model h\u2192 bb\u00af signal, with\nmh = 120 GeV. There were four appreciable sources of bb\u00af background, each with a background-to-signal ratio\n11For example, we predict the cross section for the exclusive diffractive production of a Standard Model Higgs at the LHC, with\nmh = 120 GeV, to be 2.2 fb with an uncertainty given by the range 0.9\u20135.5 fb.\n11\nin the range B\/S = 0.06\u20130.08, after the appropriate cuts. In brief, these give contributions to the background\nsubprocess cross sections of the following approximate forms\n(i) ggPP \u2192 gg (bb\u00af mimicked by gg): \u03c3\u02c6 \u223c \u03b12S\/m2,\n(ii) ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af (Jz = 2 admixture): \u03c3\u02c6 \u223c \u03b12s\/m2,\n(iii) ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af (mb 6= 0, Jz = 0 contribution): \u03c3\u02c6 \u223c \u03b12Sm2b\/m4,\n(iv) NLO ggPP \u2192 bb\u00afg contribution: \u03c3\u02c6 \u223c \u03b13S\/m2,\nwhere the renormalisation scale is specified by \u03b1S(m\n2\/4). The PP superscript is to denote that each incoming\ngluon to the hard subprocess belongs to a colour-singlet t-channel state, see Fig. 5. Note that all background\ncontributions go like \u03c3\u02c6 \u223c 1\/m2, except for (iii). In addition, for fixed missing mass resolution \u2206m, the\nbackground contains a factor \u2206m\/m. Thus for large m > 100 GeV the background cross section behaves\nroughly as\n\u03c3B = L\u03c3\u02c6B \u223c \u2206m\/m6, (17)\nwhile the Higgs signal behaves as\n\u03c3h = L\u03c3\u02c6h \u223c 1\/m3. (18)\nTo obtain a more precise behaviour one can use (15).\nIn Ref. [11] we found a signal-to-background ratio S\/B \u223c 3 for a mh = 120 GeV Standard Model Higgs\nboson. The ratio may, however, be appreciably enhanced for SUSY Higgs with large m, and\/or large tan\u03b2. It\nis interesting to note that, in the region where the background is larger than the signal (B > S), the statistical\nsignificance of the signal S\/\n\u221a\nS +B \u223c m\u22123\/\n\u221a\n\u2206m\/m6 is practically independent of mass, assuming that the\nexperimental resolution \u2206m is mass independent. Moreover, for a low mass, where bb\u00af pairs in the Jz = 0 state,\n(iii), give the dominant contribution to the background, the statistical significance increases with mass, as here\nB \u223c \u2206m\/m8.\nFinally, it is important to note that there are still various open questions which must be addressed by\nexperimentalists in order to establish the feasibility of CEDP for Higgs searches at the LHC. One of the most\nchallenging issues concerns triggering. Assuming that the trigger is based on the central detector only, the main\ntask is to reduce the rate of triggering jets in order not to reach saturation of the trigger. We present below\nsome numbers which may be useful when considering this issue.\nBased on the results of Ref. [10], we see that the cross section for the CEDP of dijets with ET > 30 GeV is\n200 pb. If we assume that the proton tagging efficiency is 0.6, then this yields 0.12 events\/sec for a luminosity\nof 1033 cm\u22122sec\u22121. At the same time, the inclusive cross section for production of a pair of jets, each with\nET > 30 GeV is about 50 \u00b5b. This leads to 50,000 events\/sec, which greatly exceeds the trigger saturation\nlimit. For CMS, for example, this latter limit is 100 events\/sec [39]. Therefore it appears necessary to devise\nadditional topological requirements in the level-1 trigger for the exclusive signal, such as making use of the\npresence of the rapidity gaps.\n6 Identifying the pseudoscalar boson, A\nIf the exclusive diffractive cross sections for scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs production were comparable, it would\nbe possible to separate them readily by the missing mass scan, and by the study of the azimuthal correlations\nbetween the outgoing proton momenta. However, we have seen that the cross section for pseudoscalar Higgs\nexclusive production is, unfortunately, strongly suppressed by the P -even selection rule, which holds for CEDP\nat LO. For values of tan\u03b2 \u223c 10\u201315, the separation between the H\/h and A bosons is much larger than their\nwidths, see Fig. 4(d). Hence it might be just possible to observe the pseudoscalar in CEDP. For example, for\ntan\u03b2 = 15 and mA = 95 GeV, the mass separation, 3.6 GeV, between h and A is about 8 times larger than the\nwidth \u0393h. The cross section\nBr(A\u2192 bb\u00af) \u00b7 \u03c3A \u2243 0.15 fb, (19)\n12\nwhen allowing for the large uncertainties in \u03c3A, could be just sufficient to bring the process to the edge of\nobservability.\nOn the other hand, one may consider the semi-exclusive process\npp\u2192 p+ j\u03c6j + p, (20)\nwhere the Higgs bosons, \u03c6 = H,A, are accompanied by two gluon jets with transverse momenta p\u22a5 satisfying\nm\u03c6 \u226b p\u22a5 \u226b 1 GeV. The emission of soft gluons, with energies (in the \u03c6 rest frame) E \u226a m\u03c6\/2, does not affect\nthe P -even selection rule. Thus in this region the scalar H boson will be dominantly produced in process (20).\nOn the other hand, in the domain\nxi \u2261 2Ei\/m\u03c6 \u223c 1 (21)\nwe lose the selection rule and have comparable H and A production. Moreover the azimuthal angular distri-\nbution12 for the gluon jets is different for the H and A cases. In particular, for gluons with x1 = x2 = 1\naccompanying A production, the azimuthal distribution is practically flat (at LO), whereas for H production\nit has the form 3 + 2 cos(2\u03c6). This observation may be used to distinguish between H and A production, and\nto study better the properties of the A boson.\nOf course, we have to pay a price, of about a factor 1\/20, to produce two extra jets with p\u22a5 in the range\nm\u03c6 \u226b p\u22a5 \u226b 1 GeV, in a rapidity interval with \u2206 ln xi \u223c 1. However, this is less than the suppression of A\nproduction by the P -even selection rule. For tan\u03b2 \u2265 30 and mA < 200 GeV the cross section still exceeds 1 fb.\nTo gain more insight, it is informative to return to the original central exclusive diffractive process, which\nwe sketch in Fig. 5(a). In the equivalent gluon approximation, the polarization vectors ~\u01ebi of the gluons, carrying\nmomentum fractions xi, are aligned along the corresponding gluon transverse momenta (Q\u2212p1)\u22a5 and (Q+p2)\u22a5.\nFor very forward protons with pi,\u22a5 \u226a Q\u22a5, this leads to a correlation between the polarization vectors, namely\n~\u01eb1 is parallel to ~\u01eb2. On the other hand, the \u03c6 production vertices behave as V (0\n+) \u223c ~\u01eb1 \u00b7~\u01eb2 and V (0\u2212) \u223c ~\u01eb1\u00d7~\u01eb2.\nTherefore the exclusive diffractive production of the pseudoscalar A boson is strongly suppressed13.\nTo change the t-channel gluon polarization we need particle emission. The best possibility would be to emit\neither a \u03b7\u2032 or a \u03b7c 0\n\u2212 meson. Unfortunately the corresponding cross sections are too low. We lose more than\na factor of 10\u22124, which is a stronger suppression than that coming from the P -even, Jz = 0 selection rule.\nFor this reason we considered the possibility of emitting a (colour singlet) pair of gluons, that is process (20).\nFor \u2019soft\u2019 (xi \u226a 1) emission, the dominant contribution comes from the term in the triple-gluon vertex which\ncontains g\u03bd\u03bd\n\u2032\n, and so does not change the gluon polarization vector. Here the indices \u03bd and \u03bd\u2032 correspond to the\nt-channel gluon polarization before and after the emission of the s-channel gluon. However for large xi > 1 the\nmajor contribution comes from the term with g\u03bd\u00b5, where \u00b5 is the s-channel gluon polarization index. In this\ncase after the emission, the new t-channel polarization vector is directed along the new transverse momentum\nQ\u2032\n\u22a5\n\u2243 \u2212p\u22a5. Thus for xi \u223c 1 the cross sections for H and A production are comparable, but now the LO QCD\nbackground is no longer suppressed.\nMaybe the best chance to identify the A(0\u2212) boson is to observe the double-diffractive inclusive process\npp\u2192 X + \u03c6+ Y, (22)\nwhere both protons are destroyed. In terms of t-channel gluon polarization, this is equivalent to the limit xi \u226b 1\nin the previous reaction (20). Process (22) has the advantage of a much larger cross section14. However, just as\n12The possibility to discriminate the CP-parity of different Higgs states by measuring the azimuthal correlations of the two tagged\ngluon jets in inclusive \u03c6gg production was mentioned in Ref. [40]. However, the proof of the feasibility of such an approach in\nnon-diffractive \u03c6gg production requires further study of the possible dilution of the effect caused by parton showers (see also [41]).\nAn exclusive environment of the jets may be needed.\n13However, when the polarisation vectors ~\u01ebi are parallel to ~Q\u22a5, it follows, after integration over the azimuthal angle of ~Q\u22a5, that\nthe LO QCD production of bb\u00af pair is also suppressed by a factor (mb\/ET )\n2; which results in a very low QCD bb\u00af background to the\nCEDP.\n14Note that instead of the factors 1\/b, which came from the ti = \u2212p\n2\ni\u22a5\nintegrals limited by the proton form factors, as in (9)\n(see also eq.(8) in Ref.[10]), here we have logarithmic dti\/ti integrals over the intervals Q2\u22a5 \u226a |ti| \u226a m\n2\n\u03c6\n. Moreover, the Sudakov\nsupression (which arises from the requirement that no extra relatively \u2019hard\u2019 gluons are emitted with transverse momenta k\u22a5 in\nthe interval | ~Q\u22a5 \u00b1 ~pi\u22a5| \u226a k\u22a5 \u226a m\u03c6\/2) is much weaker than for the exclusive process due to the larger values of pi\u22a5, see [10, 29].\nTherefore the effective ggPP luminosity for double-diffractive inclusive production is much larger than in the CEDP case.\n13\nfor the above semi-exclusive process, we do not have the Jz = 0 selection rule to suppress the bb\u00af background,\nnor do we have the possibility of the good missing mass resolution15. On the other hand, the ggPP luminosity\nis more than order of magnitude larger than for the pure exclusive case. For example, for double-diffractive\ninclusive production, with the rapidity gaps \u2206\u03b7 > 3, the luminosity is 20 times larger than that for the exclusive\ndiffractive production of a Higgs boson with mass mH = 120 GeV (see for details [10]). So, even for the \u03c4\u03c4\ndecay mode we expect a cross section, \u03c3incl, of about 20 fb for A production in the MSSM with tan\u03b2 = 30 and\nmA = 120 GeV. This looks promising, provided that the probability for gluon misidentification as a \u03c4 is less\nthan 1\/150, which appears to be feasible[17, 42].\nDespite the QCD background, the observation of the A boson also appears to be feasible for the bb\u00af decay\nmode, since then \u03c3 \u223c 200 fb which gives a signal-to-background ratio of S\/B = 1\/24. We have evaluated the\nQCD bb\u00af background using the LO formula for the ggPP \u2192 bb\u00af cross section (without any K factor) with the\npolar angle cut 60\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 120\u25e6 as was done in [11], and assumed a mass resolution of \u2206M = 10 GeV. The\nefficiency of tagging the b jets was taken to be about 0.6 [11]. This results in a statistical significance16 of\nthe signal for the A boson of S\/\n\u221a\nS +B \u223c 8.5\u03c3, for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\u22121. Moreover one can\nmeasure the azimuthal angle \u03d5 between the transverse energy ~ET flows in the forward and backward regions,\nthat is between the total transverse momenta of the X and Y systems. The angular dependence is driven by\nthe momenta transferred across the rapidity gaps, and has the form\ncos2 \u03d5 for H(0+)\nand sin2 \u03d5 for A(0\u2212),\nwhereas for the QCD bb\u00af background the \u03d5 dependence is flat (if we neglect the quark mass (mb \u226aMbb\u00af\/2) and\naverage over the b-jet momentum direction; see Eq.(15) of [43] for Q = 0). Thus we may suppress the H(0+)\nsignal by selecting events with \u03d5 close to \u03c0\/2. We emphasize that here we deal with rather large ET jets,\nET \u223c 5\u221220 GeV, and so the angular dependences are largely insensitive to the soft rescatterings. Furthermore,\ninstead of measuring the ~pT of the jets (as in Ref.[40]), for process (22) it is enough to measure the total\ntransverse energy ~ET in the forward (and backward) regions of proton dissociation.\nRecall that the effective ggPP luminosity for the inclusive process (22) was evaluated using the leading\norder formula. Thus we cannot exclude rather large NLO corrections, particularly for the non-forward BFKL\namplitude. On the other hand, here, we do not enter the infrared domain. Moreover, with \u201dskewed\u201d kinematics,\nthe NLO BFKL corrections are expected to be much smaller than in forward case. So we may expect that the\nuncertainty of the prediction is about factor of 3 - 4 (or even better).\n7 Conclusion\nThe Central Exclusive Diffractive Processes promise a rich physics menu for studying the mechanism of elec-\ntroweak symmetry breaking, and the detailed properties of the Higgs sector. This considerably extends the\nphysics potential of the LHC and may provide studies which are complementary, both to the traditional non-\ndiffractive approaches at the LHC, and to the physics program of a future Linear e+e\u2212 collider. To some extent\nthis approach gives information which otherwise may have to await a Linear e+e\u2212 collider.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Alfred Bartl, Albert De Roeck, Abdelhak Djouadi, Howie Haber, Leif Lonnblad, Walter Majerotto,\nRisto Orava, Andrei Shuvaev, Michael Spira, and especially Sasha Nikitenko and Georg Weiglein, for useful\ndiscussions.
