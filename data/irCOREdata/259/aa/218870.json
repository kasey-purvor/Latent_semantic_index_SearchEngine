This article argues that universals and variation in kin terminology result from the interaction of (1) an innate conceptual\nstructure of kinship, homologous with conceptual structure in other domains, and (2) principles of optimal, \u201cgrammatical\u201d\ncommunication active in language in general. Kin terms from two languages, English and Seneca, show how terminologies that look\nvery different on the surface may result from variation in the rankings of a universal set of constraints. Constraints on kin terms\nform a system: some are concerned with absolute features of kin (sex), others with the position (distance and direction) of kin in\n\u201ckinship space,\u201d others with groups and group boundaries (matrilines, patrilines, generations, etc.). Also, kin terms sometimes\nextend indefinitely via recursion, and recursion in kin terminology has parallels with recursion in other areas of language. Thus the\nstudy of kinship sheds light on two areas of cognition, and their phylogeny. The conceptual structure of kinship seems to borrow its\norganization from the conceptual structure of space, while being specialized for representing genealogy. And the grammar of\nkinship looks like the product of an evolved grammar faculty, opportunistically active across traditional domains of semantics,\nsyntax, and phonology. Grammar is best understood as an offshoot of a uniquely human capacity for playing coordination games.\nKeywords: cognitive anthropology; conceptual structure; coordination games; evolutionary psychology; grammar; kinship; kin terms;\nlanguage evolution; Optimality Theory (OT); recursion\n1. Introduction\nThis article addresses a longstanding puzzle in the human\nsciences: Kinship and language, very different in content,\nare intriguingly similar in form. Kinship has to do with\naunts and uncles, matrilineages and patrilineages, and\nascending and descending generations, while linguistics\nhas to do with phonemes and syllables, morphemes and\nword classes, and heads and phrases. But kinship and\nlanguage are similar in their combinatorial structure,\npointing toward general principles of cognition or com-\nmunication at work in both cases (Kroeber 1909, Le\u00b4vi-\nStrauss 1963).\nThe parallels between kinship rules and language rules\nwere the subject of pioneering work several decades ago,\nin the heyday of structural linguistics and structuralism.\nEspecially in the area of kin terminology, and especially\nfrom the 1960s to the 1970s, researchers demonstrated\nthat the classification of kin reflects not just social facts,\nbut also cognitive and linguistic principles. Cross-cultural\nregularities in kin terminology were documented, compar-\nable to regularities in color terminology (D\u2019Andrade 1971;\nGreenberg 1966; 1975; 1990; Nerlove & Romney 1967),\nand an assortment of formal methods was devised to\nanalyze systematic variation and universals in kin terminol-\nogy (Buchler & Selby 1968; Goodenough 1965; Lounsbury\n1964a; 1964b; Romney & D\u2019Andrade 1964; Scheffler 1968;\nScheffler & Lounsbury 1971; Wallace & Atkins 1960).\nBut intellectual fashions have changed since then. In\nspite of important advances (Gould 2000; Hage 1997;\n2001; Hirschfeld 1989; Kronenfeld 1996; 2009; Leaf\n2006; Lehman 1993; 2001; Read 1984; 2001a; 2001b),\nthe study of kinship, language, and cognition now finds\nitself in a marginal position in anthropology and cognitive\nscience. Cultural anthropology, with some exceptions, has\ngrown increasingly committed to cultural particularism,\nand increasingly divorced from developments in cognitive\nscience. The minority of anthropologists who apply evol-\nutionary theory to kinship mostly have not investigated\nits cognitive aspects. (On the \u201cfall of kinship\u201d in anthropol-\nogy, see Sousa 2003 and commentators, and Shapiro\n2008.) Meanwhile, as linguistics has grown increasingly\nspecialized \u2013 and especially as syntax has moved to a\ndominant position in the field \u2013 some earlier connections\nwith other areas of inquiry have weakened.\nIn this article, however, I argue that the classic topic of\nkinship and language deserves a fresh look in the light of\nrecent progress in linguistics and cognitive science \u2013\nand, in turn, that the study of kinship is relevant to\ncurrent debates about mind and language. The rest of\nthis section introduces advances in two areas \u2013 the\nexploration of conceptual structure at the interface\nbetween semantics and cognition, and the development\nDOUG JONES is Associate Professor of Anthropology at\nthe University of Utah and author of Physical Attrac-\ntiveness and the Theory of Sexual Selection (1996, Uni-\nversity of Michigan, Museum of Anthropology) and co-\neditor (with Bojka Milicic) of Kinship, Language and\nPrehistory (2010, University of Utah). He is interested\nin how the social anthropology of kinship relates to\nrecent advances in the cognitive sciences and evol-\nutionary theory. Jones is also currently doing research\non the cognitive anthropology of race in Brazil.\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33, 367\u2013416\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10000890\n# Cambridge University Press 2010 0140-525X\/10 $40.00 367\nof a new approach to rules of language called optimality\ntheory \u2013 and previews how they apply to kinship.\nConceptual structure. The study of human cognition has\nreceived a major boost from the realization that there are\ntwo distinct levels of language \u2013 ordinary and VIP, as it\nwere \u2013 which differ both in linguistic behavior and in\nmeaning (Grimshaw 2005; Jackendoff 1983; 2002; Pinker\n1989; 2007; Talmy 2000a). The first, open-class or\nlexical, level includes most nouns and verbs. The\nnumber of open-class forms in any language is very\nlarge, and virtually any imaginable concept can receive\nan open-class form.\nThe second, closed-class or grammatical, level is a more\nexclusive club. Forms at this level include prepositions like\nin and on, demonstratives like this and that, inflections like\nthe plural -s and past tense -d, and word classes like mass\nnoun and intransitive verb (but not specific instances of\nnouns or verbs). Within languages, closed-class forms\nare limited in number: Compare the number of preposi-\ntions, demonstratives, tenses, and word classes in\nEnglish with the number of nouns and verbs. Closed-\nclass forms are also restricted in the range of meanings\nthey bear. Across languages, some of the distinctions that\nregularly make it into closed-class forms are: singular\nand plural, bounded and unbounded, figure and ground,\nnear and far, present and past, unmovable\/inalienable\nand movable\/alienable, and human and nonhuman. But\nmany more semantic distinctions \u2013 some quite impor-\ntant \u2013 are seldom or never registered in closed-class\nforms, including odd and even, legal and illegal, and absol-\nute size or duration (e.g., more and less than x feet long or\nt years old).\nThe distinction between two levels of language is not\nonly interesting in its own right, but also potentially impor-\ntant for investigating cognitive universals. Suppose, as\nmany lines of evidence suggest, that in learning about\nwords and the world, people draw not just on perceptual\ndata but also on an inventory of innate concepts. Then\nopen-class and closed-class forms reflect this inventory\nin different ways. With open-class forms, universal con-\ncepts are hooked up with one another to yield a virtually\nunlimited array of culturally variable compound ideas\n(Wierzbicka 1996). With closed-class forms, the internal\n\u201catomic structure\u201d of universal concepts shows up in regu-\nlarities in how related conceptual primitives are merged or\ndistinguished.\nTwo findings stand out from the study of closed-class\nlinguistic forms. First, forms carve out a small number of\nsemantic fields, including space, time, causation, mental\nstates, and social relations like possession. Second, there\nare close parallels across fields. Specifically, nonspatial\nfields seem to borrow much of their organization from\nthe conceptualization of objects and motions in space. In\nlanguage after language, time is treated as a more abstract\nversion of space, change in state as an abstract kind of\nmovement, causation as an abstract push, possession as\nabstract location, and so on (Bierwisch 1996; Hurford\n2003; Jackendoff 1983; Pinker 1989; 2007; Talmy 2000b).\nOptimality Theory. While different linguistic domains \u2013\nsemantics, phonology, morphology, syntax \u2013 have their\nown organizing principles, there are also general prin-\nciples of rule-governed \u201cgrammatical\u201d communication\noperating across domains. Such at least is the implication\nof research in Optimality Theory (OT), a powerful new\napproach to rules of language, originally developed in pho-\nnology but apparently of much wider application (Archan-\ngeli & Langedoen 1997; McCarthy 2001; Prince &\nSmolensky 2004\/1993).\nOT doesn\u2019t say what the rules of language are \u2013 rules\ndiffer among linguistic domains \u2013 instead, it describes\nhow rules interact. According to OT, rules, or constraints,\ndon\u2019t actively transform linguistic representations but act\nas filters on randomly generated variation, with each con-\nstraint weeding out variants that violate it. Constraints may\nbe mutually inconsistent, so grammars manage trade-offs\nbetween conflicting constraints through constraint\nranking. Constraints are put in rank order, with each con-\nstraint strictly dominating lower ranking ones: One viola-\ntion of a constraint outweighs any number of violations\nof all lower ranking constraints. OT covers cross-linguistic\nuniversals and variation in grammar in a unified frame-\nwork: To a first approximation, languages all use the\nsame constraints but differ in their constraint rankings.\nOT has inspired large body of research: As of this\nwriting, one major online resource, the Rutgers Optimality\nArchive (roa.rutgers.edu), has 1,069 articles on file. Yet in\nsome ways OT is still finding its place in linguistics. For\nexample, recent theories of language evolution (Hauser\net al. 2002; Hurford 2007; Jackendoff 2002) have nothing\nto say about the phylogenesis and adaptive significance\nof OT. We may get a better idea of the nature and poten-\ntial of the theory by comparing it to Utility Theory (UT) in\neconomics. Both UT and OT are theories of constrained\noptimization. They posit that people mentally search a\nlarge space of possibilities to discover an optimum,\neither an optimal basket of goods or an optimal linguistic\noutput. Optimal doesn\u2019t mean perfect. It means doing as\nwell as possible in the face of trade-offs between conflict-\ning constraints. Yet optimization works differently in UT\nand OT (Prince 2007; Smolensky & Legendre 2006). In\nstandard UT, trade-offs and potential outcomes vary quan-\ntitatively, so economic optimization involves finding\nmaxima of continuous functions. In OT, rules are ranked\nrather than numerically weighted, so grammatical optimiz-\nation is discrete and combinatorial. UT and OT thus seem\nto cover two contrasting macro-domains of human behav-\nior, the economical and the grammatical.\nBoth theories of conceptual structure (as revealed by\nclosed-class forms) and OT approaches to grammar\napply to kin terminology \u2013 or so I argue here. The\nsurface complexity of kin terminology across cultures\nresults from the interplay of a conceptual system\nadapted for representing kinship and other social relation-\nships, and a \u201cgrammar\u201d system bridging conceptual struc-\nture and language with principles of optimal\ncommunication, as laid out in Figure 1. The rest of this\narticle works its way upstream through this figure, first\nlaying out the principles governing kin terminology (sect.\n2 to 4) and then advancing some hypotheses about the\nconceptual structure of kinship and the human grammar\nfaculty (sect. 5).\nThe specific goals of this analysis are to offer an account\nof why kin terminologies have the shapes they have, and,\nconversely, to use constrained variation in kin terminolo-\ngies as a window on two cognitive domains. What is\nmeant by the \u201cshape\u201d of kin terminologies should\nbecome clearer as the exposition proceeds and I develop\nan input-output account of kin terms: It includes both\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n368 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nsemantic contrasts among categories and the regularities\nthat account for how contrasts get extended out to ranges\nof kinfolk, but it does not cover everything that people\nthink about kinship or all the ways people use kin terms\nto talk or think about other things in the world. It is about\nthe structure, rather than the content, of kin terms.\nLimitations of space mean that some important topics get\nshort shrift here. First, I touch on connections between\nsocial organization and kin terminology \u2013 see the lower\nand left areas of Figure 1 \u2013 but do not explore them at\nlength. I believe the evidence is strong that kin terminology\nreflects, but doesn\u2019t just reduce to, sociology; the focus here\nis on cognition and language. Second, I bring up alternative\nformal approaches to kin terminology where relevant, but\nwithout extended, side-by-side exposition and comparison;\nthere is an outline of the relationship between this work and\nalternative approaches at the end of the next section.\nFinally, this article employs only as much of the formidable\ntechnical apparatus of kinship theory and Optimality\nTheory as seems appropriate to illustrate important\npoints. Other publications (Jones 2003a; 2003b; 2004;\n2010) include more technical discussion, including kin\nterm derivations using OT \u201ctableaus,\u201d and supporting data.\n2. Optimal kin terms, English and Seneca\n2.1. English and Seneca\nThis section and following ones turn to two kin terminolo-\ngies, American English (henceforth English) and Seneca,\nto illustrate basic principles. English kin terms are probably\nfamiliar to most readers (Goodenough 1965). The rules\ngoverning English kin terms are similar to those in most\nmodern Western European languages and Japanese.\nSeneca is another matter. The Seneca Indians are one of\nthe original five (later six) nations in the Iroquois League\nof modern upstate New York. The comparison of English\nand Iroquois provided one of the earliest demonstrations\nthat kin terms in different languages may be organized on\nvery different lines (Morgan 1954\/1851; 1997\/1871; Traut-\nmann 1987).\nPortions of the two terminologies are shown in Figure 2.\nThe figure gives terms in both languages for types of\nsiblings, parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins relative to an\nanchor called Ego. Terms for distant generations (grand-\nparents, etc.), descending generations (niece, grandson,\netc.) and affines (wife, brother-in-law, etc.) are omitted.\nThere is a strong consensus on terms among speakers of\neach language. Spelling of Seneca terms follows Morgan,\nsacrificing accuracy for accessibility.\nWe may note several things about Figure 2. Not only do\nEnglish and Seneca of course have different words for kin,\nthey also have different kin terminologies \u2013 two kin types\ncalled by different terms in English may be called by a\nsingle term in Seneca, and vice versa. Both terminologies\nare regular: In neither case are terms scattered randomly\naround the diagram. For example, English systematically\nlabels every Parent\u2019s Sibling\u2019s Child a cousin. Seneca is just\nas systematic in its own way. Cousins related through\nparents of opposite sex (\u2018cross cousins\u2019 in anthropological\njargon) are ahgareseh, while cousins related through\nparents of the same sex (\u2018parallel cousins\u2019) are equated\nwith appropriate sibling types. (In this article, capitals indi-\ncate kin types, italics indicate native-language kin terms,\nand single quotation marks indicate glosses of kin terms.)\nSome distinctions are quite important in both\nlanguages: Kin in different generations are terminologi-\ncally separate for all kin types shown. Other distinctions\nare moderately important: In both languages a sex distinc-\ntion holds for parents\u2019 siblings and siblings, but not for\ncousins (except where cousins are equated with siblings\nin Seneca). Some distinctions are more important in one\nlanguage than the other: English cares more about the dis-\ntinction between near and distant kin than Seneca, while\nSeneca, but not English, distinguishes some kin by\nwhether they are parallel or cross, and by relative age.\nSome aspects of Seneca kin terminology are probably\nrelated to Seneca social organization. The Seneca were\nmatrilineal, organized in kin groups based on descent\nthrough the female line (Morgan 1954\/1851; Palmer 1934).\nSmall-scale descent groups, or lineages, were associated\nwith residence in longhouses. The core of each lineage was\na group of related women. A man left his family and went\nto live with his wife\u2019s kin when he married; a woman contin-\nued to live with her mother and sisters and their dependent\nchildren and husbands. Inheritance and succession to office\nFigure 1. From conceptual structure and grammar to kin terminology. The top row shows human universals; the bottom row shows\ncultural variables. Arrows show causal links.\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 369\nwere matrilineal as well: not from father to son, but from a\nwoman to her daughters, sisters, and sisters\u2019 daughters,\nand from a man to his brothers and sisters\u2019 sons. On a\nlarger scale, each lineage belonged to one of eight named\nclans, with multiple lineages in each clan. Clans were exoga-\nmous (out-marrying), so that a woman and her husband\ncame from different clans. As a result, Ego belonged to the\nsame clan as his or her Mother, Mother\u2019s Sister, and all\ntheir children, while Ego\u2019s Father along with Father\u2019s\nSister and her children belonged to another clan, as did\nthe children of Mother\u2019s Brother.\n2.2. Applying OT\nSocial factors like those above probably influence English\nand Seneca kin terminologies, but the terminologies are\nalso governed by cognitive\/linguistic principles. Here, I\ntreat these in the framework of Optimality Theory. We\nbegin with two lists of the constraints governing a portion\nof kin terminology in English and Seneca. The same con-\nstraints appear in both lists, but in different order.\nEnglish Seneca\nDISTINGUISH\nGENERATIONS\nDISTINGUISH\nGENERATIONS\nDISTINGUISH DISTANCE DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN\nMINIMIZE COUSINS MINIMIZE COUSINS\nDISTINGUISH SEX DISTINGUISH SEX\nMINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019\nSIBLINGS\nMINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019\nSIBLINGS\nMINIMIZE SIBLINGS DISTINGUISH GRADE\nDISTINGUISH GRADE MINIMIZE SIBLINGS\nDISTINGUISH MATRIKIN DISTINGUISH DISTANCE\nThe constraints are of two kinds. One kind, taking the\ngeneric form DISTINGUISH FEATURE, requires that kin\nFigure 2. Some English and Seneca kin terms, in relation to Ego (center of chart). Circles are females, triangles males, squares either\nsex. Relative age (older or younger than Ego) is shown for siblings and some cousins. Shading indicates different lines of descent\nthrough females (matrilines).\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n370 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nterms be multiplied as necessary to preserve information\nabout distinctions such as generation, genealogical dis-\ntance, sex, and so on. The other kind, of the generic\nform MINIMIZE KIN TYPE, requires that speakers use as\nfew terms as possible for kin types such as Cousin,\nParent\u2019s Sibling, and so on. Clearly these requirements\nfor maximizing information and minimizing terms cannot\nbe satisfied simultaneously. Instead each language makes\na conventionalized trade-off between constraints by\nranking them, with each constraint taking strict pre-\ncedence over lower-ranking constraints. The constraint\nranking defines the grammar of each language, establish-\ning a shared code among speakers and listeners.\nConsider how the left-hand ranking governs the categ-\norization of, say, an Older Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son (i.e.,\nolder than Ego). In English, this relative is merged with\nother parent\u2019s sibling\u2019s children, as cousin. But there are\nother possibilities. The kin type could be merged with\nParent\u2019s Brother or with Older Brother. It could receive\nits own separate expression, or be categorized as \u2018older\ncousin,\u2019 sex unspecified. In OT, all these possibilities \u2013\nall possible distinctions and equations involving a given\nkin type \u2013 are evaluated, in parallel, by the first constraint.\nOnly those candidates that incur the fewest violations of\nthe constraint survive; the rest are eliminated. The survi-\nvors are then filtered through the second constraint, and\nso on, until just one optimal categorization survives.\nThe first constraint in the English ranking, DIS-\nTINGUISH GENERATIONS, demands that different gener-\nations of kin be kept terminologically distinct. This\neliminates any terminology that puts cousins in the same\ncategory as uncles. The second constraint, DISTINGUISH\nDISTANCE, demands that near and distant kin be distin-\nguished. This eliminates any terminology equating\ncousins and siblings. The third constraint, MINIMIZE\nCOUSINS, would be perfectly satisfied if English had no\ncousin terms. But the two preceding constraints have\neliminated this possibility. Instead MINIMIZE COUSINS is\npartially satisfied: it selects as the winning candidate a\nsingle \u2018cousin\u2019 term, with no distinctions by sex or age.\nThe effacement of sex and age distinctions violates two\nother constraints, DISTINGUISH SEX and DISTINGUISH\nGRADE. (The latter enforces distinctions related to senior-\nity and social rank, including relative age.) But these rank\nlower than MINIMIZE COUSINS, so the violations are moot.\nWith the constraints acting in the order given, \u2018cousin\u2019 \u2013\nequivalent to \u2018parent\u2019s sibling\u2019s child\u2019 \u2013 is the optimal\noutput.\nNext, consider parents\u2019 siblings in English. Since DIS-\nTINGUISH DISTANCE and DISTINGUISH SEX outrank\nMINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS, these relatives are distin-\nguished, from parents, and by sex, as aunt and uncle.\nEnglish sibling terms are similar. DISTINGUISH SEX\nranks higher than MINIMIZE SIBLINGS, which ranks\nhigher than DISTINGUISH GRADE, so English has two\nsibling terms, brother and sister, distinguished by sex but\nnot relative age.\nSeneca cousin and sibling terms follow a different logic.\nThe high rank of the DISTINGUISH GENERATIONS con-\nstraint means that Seneca, like English, avoids cross-\ngeneration equations. But the next constraint on the list,\nDISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, does something else. This con-\nstraint dictates that relatives in cross or adjacent matrilines\nbe distinguished, so that cross cousins (stripes in Fig. 2)\nare distinguished from parallel cousins and siblings\n(stippled or white). But the constraint allows kin in the\nsame matriline, or nonadjacent matrilines, to be merged.\n(See next section for more discussion.) In combination\nwith MINIMIZE COUSINS this results in the Seneca combi-\nnation of one term for \u201ccross cousin,\u201d and the equation of\nparallel cousins with siblings.\nParents\u2019 siblings in Seneca follow a similar pattern.\nFather\u2019s Sister and Mother\u2019s Brother get separate terms\nfrom other aunts and uncles, distinguished by sex, reflect-\ning the high rank of DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN and DIS-\nTINGUISH SEX. Mother\u2019s Sister and Father\u2019s Brother are\nequated with the parents in their respective matrilines,\nMother and Father, because MINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIB-\nLINGS trumps DISTINGUISH DISTANCE, the constraint\nthat keeps parents\u2019 siblings and parents apart in English.\nFinally, the ranks of DISTINGUISH SEX, DISTINGUISH\nGRADE, and MINIMIZE SIBLINGS, result in siblings (and\nparallel cousins equated with siblings) being distinguished\nboth by sex and relative age.1\n2.3. Generating variation\nThere are many other ways of classifying cousins and other\nkin. For example, French makes a sex distinction among\ncousins that English and Seneca don\u2019t. Consider the\nFrench movie title Cousin, Cousine: A close translation,\nfollowing anthropological convention, would be Parent\u2019s\nSibling\u2019s Son, Parent\u2019s Sibling\u2019s Daughter. But the\nEnglish language remake of the movie was instead entitled\nCousins, losing the racy cross-sex pairing of the original.\nSuppose, in the English constraint ranking above, we\nmove DISTINGUISH SEX up one place. With this constraint\nnow outranking MINIMIZE COUSINS, the new ranking\ngenerates a kin terminology with a sex distinction among\ncousins as well as siblings. This is how Optimality\nTheory handles variation in kin terminology. The same\nconstraints, in two different rankings, generate English\nand Seneca terminologies. A small change in the English\nranking generates another terminology, and further per-\nmutations generate many more. With the right constraint\nrankings, separate cousin terms disappear completely,\nand Cousin merges with other kin types, in the same or\ndifferent generations. With other rankings, all siblings\nare covered by one generic term, or they are distinguished\nby relative age but not by sex. Each of these possibilities\nis found, fairly frequently, among the world\u2019s languages\n(Murdock 1970; Nerlove & Romney 1967).\nKin terminology is prodigiously variable. Introductory\ntreatments of the topic often limit themselves to listing a\nfew major typological variants of, say, cousin terminology:\nThus English and French have \u201cEskimo\u201d-style cousin\nterms, while Seneca is \u201cIroquois\u201d (Fox 1967; Stone 2000).\nBut no list of manageable size can really accommodate\nthe complex permutations and interdependencies invol-\nved: For example, English resembles Seneca, not\nFrench, in ignoring sex distinctions among cousins. Yet\nkin terminology is also highly constrained. Languages\naround the world have independently hit on similar\npatterns, while largely steering clear of other imaginable\npossibilities. Kin terminologies are not perfectly regular,\nbut overwhelmingly so (D\u2019Andrade 1971; Nerlove &\nRomney 1967).\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 371\nOT offers an account of variation and universals in kin\nterminology, as the outcome of variable rankings among\nuniversal constraints. OT is a generative theory, going\nbeyond surface generalizations and one-culture-at-a-time\nformal analysis to show how interaction between princi-\nples generates terminologies, without overgenerating and\nproducing rare or nonexistent terminologies.\nIn kin terminology, as in phonology, research in the frame-\nwork of OT builds on and synthesizes previous work. The\ntheory I present here very much depends on previous the-\nories of kin terminology, each of which, I suggest, elaborates\non a different aspect of kin terminology to offer a partial view\nof the subject. The organization of terminology around dis-\ntinctive features is the starting point for componential analy-\nsis (Goodenough 1965; 1967). Markedness and prototype\neffects receive particular attention in structural linguistic\nanalysis (Greenberg 1966; 1975; 1990; Hage 2001). The\nextension of kin terms to genealogically distant kin is the\nbasis of reduction rules (Lounsbury 1964a; 1964b; Scheffler\n1968). And the abstract algebra of kin categories, including\nidentity elements, reciprocals, relative products, and abstract\nsymmetries, is where kinship algebra begins (Read 1984;\n2001a). Each of these receives some attention in the rest of\nthis paper: distinctive features in section 3.1, markedness in\n3.2, genealogical extension in 4.1, and formal relations\nbetween categories, and their relation to genealogy, in 5.2.\nYet each of these alternative approaches, I would argue,\nhas its limitations. Componential analysis is particularly suc-\ncessful in discovering semantic contrasts among kin terms,\nless successful in accounting for where contrasts are active\nand inactive, and how contrasts are extended to more\ndistant relations. Markedness theory is a set of observations,\nnot a generative theory. Reduction rules and kinship algebra\nhandle terms for more distant relatives in a more natural, less\npost hoc way than componential analysis, but don\u2019t offer\nmuch explanation of why particular reduction rules or struc-\ntural equations operate, and not others. The rest of this\narticle will suggest how these limitations can be overcome\nin the framework of Optimality Theory.\n3. Constraints and scales\nThe previous section introduced several constraints as\nneeded to illustrate some basics of Optimality Theory. This\nsection proceeds more systematically, proposing a set of viol-\nable constraints on kin terminology, and associated scales\nlimiting allowed permutations in constraint rankings. The\nlist may be incomplete, and some of the rules may turn out\nto need reformulation, but this work has advanced far\nenough to allow this conclusion: Constraints and scales are\nnot a hodge-podge; they form a system.\nThis system is set out in Figure 3. The left-hand column\ngives seven faithfulness constraints. The right-hand\ncolumn lists three markedness scales. The middle\ncolumn diagrams these: Dotted lines show how faithful-\nness constraints distinguish kin types, and arrows point\ntoward less marked types. The figure is divided horizon-\ntally into three parts. The top part shows a nonrelational,\nabsolute distinction, the sex distinction. The middle part\nshows constraints and scales concerned with the position \u2013\nthe genealogical distance or direction \u2013 of kin types rela-\ntive to Ego. Finally, the bottom part shows constraints\nand scales concerned with how the nexus of kinship can\nbe cut to yield bounded groups, such that a kin type may\nbelong to Ego\u2019s in-group, or to an out-group.\nI review constraints and scales following.\n3.1. Seven faithfulness constraints\nKin terms typically fall into natural classes, defined by the\npresence or absence of distinctive features (Goodenough\n1965; 1967). This property of kin terminologies is\naccommodated in OT by faithfulness constraints, which\nforbid terminological mergers of kin types differing with\nrespect to some feature. Here I introduce a set of faithful-\nness constraints, and briefly contrast them with some tra-\nditional distinctive features.\n1. DISTINGUISH SEX. A kin type\u2019s sex is not a relation-\nship, but an absolute category. You are a parent or a\nyounger sibling in relation to someone, but a female or a\nmale on your own. All kin terminologies make some absol-\nute sex distinctions, which can be handled by a DIS-\nTINGUISH SEX constraint.\n2. DISTINGUISH DISTANCE. A distance function for con-\nsanguineal kin types can be defined as follows: Let a consan-\nguineal chain consist of (1) any number of parent types,\nfollowed by (2) at most one sibling type, followed by (3)\nany number of child types. Formulas fitting this format\ninclude Younger Brother, Father\u2019s Daughter, Mother\u2019s\nSister, and Older Mother\u2019s Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son\u2019s Son.\nCount as one link each of the following: Parent, Sibling,\nand Child, except that Parent\u2019s Child, if present, counts as\none link not two. Then Older Brother and Father\u2019s Daughter\nare one link from Ego, Mother\u2019s Sister two links, and Older\nMother\u2019s Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son\u2019s Son five links. DIS-\nTINGUISH DISTANCE is violated when kin at different con-\nsanguineal distances are equated with one another.\n3. DISTINGUISH GRADE. Some kin types are fully reci-\nprocal: if A is grandparent to B, then B is always grandchild\nto A, and the converse. Some kin types are partially recipro-\ncal: if A is aunt to B, then B is sometimes niece to A, and the\nconverse, depending on their sex. Full and partial recipro-\ncals are equidistant from Ego, so the previous constraint,\nDISTINGUISH DISTANCE, does nothing to distinguish them.\nInstead another constraint, DISTINGUISH GRADE, rules\nout any equation of reciprocals.\nBut DISTINGUISH GRADE does more than this. It is con-\ncerned more generally with differences in grade or rank,\ndistinguishing kin who outrank Ego from those outranked\nby Ego. The directed axes along which kin may rank higher\nor lower than Ego include:\n\u2020 Relative age Older Sibling vs. Younger\nSibling, for example,\n\u2020 Ascending vs.\nDescending generations\nParent, Parent\u2019s Sibling, or\nGrandparent vs. Child,\nSibling\u2019s Child, or\nGrandchild,\n\u2020 Matrilateral vs.\nPatrilateral cross kin\nMother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Child vs.\nFather\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child,\nand\n\u2020 Man-to-wife vs. Woman-\nto-husband affines\nMan\u2019s Wife\u2019s Brother vs.\nMan\u2019s Sister\u2019s Husband.\nAny of these axes can be used to assign grades or ranks to\nkin types (not to be confused with constraint rankings!), so\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n372 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nFigure 3.

An arrow points toward near kin, who\nare less marked.\nThe distinction between kin ranked higher and lower than Ego is shown by a dotted horizontal line separating two squares. An arrow\npoints toward high ranked kin, who are less marked.\nLOWER PANEL\nThree group-generating constraints are represented in two different ways.\nFirst, the inset diagram shows the elementary conceptual operations involved in distinguishing matrikin, patrikin, and generations: in\nthe trio of Father, Mother, and Ego, three dotted lines cut off Father only, Mother only, or both, from Ego. Arrows point toward less\nmarked, in-group kin.\nSecond, three peripheral diagrams show how these cuts, applied to all father-child, mother-child, or parent-child links, generate\nmatrilines, patrilines, and generations, respectively.\nThe distinction between consanguines and affines is represented at the bottom by a dotted line separating spouses, with marriage shown by\u00bc.\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 373\nthat, for example, Older Sibling ranks higher than Ego,\nand Younger Sibling lower. Along any axis, DISTINGUISH\nGRADE is violated whenever kin outranking Ego are\nequated with kin outranked by Ego, as long as ranks are\nnot reversed on another axis.\nRank distinctions in terminology commonly have some\nbasis in social hierarchy. The first two axes above are\nbased on the hierarchy of senior and junior kin. The last\ntwo may come into play where \u201cwife-givers\u201d outrank\n\u201cwife-takers,\u201d or vice versa (Needham 1958; Parkin 1997).\nThe two preceding constraints are concerned with\nwhere a kin type is positioned relative to Ego in the web\nof kinship. The next four constraints are concerned\ninstead with where a kin type is positioned relative to a\ngroup or category to which Ego belongs. Since (barring\nclose inbreeding) the open, bilateral network of kin con-\nnections among individuals has no natural borders,\ngroups in kinship space must be constructed by treating\nsome kinds of kinship links as defining within-group\nbonds, and others as defining between-group boundaries.\n4. DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN. This constraint treats a\nmother-child link as a bond, and a father-child link as a\nboundary. It allows terminological mergers among the\nmaternally linked kin around Ego, including Sibling,\nMother, Mother\u2019s Sibling, and Mother\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child,\nbut is violated by mergers between Ego\u2019s matrikin and\nthose across a paternal boundary, like Father and his\nmatrikin (Father\u2019s Sibling and Father\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child) or\nMother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Child. The constraint also allows\nmembers of these out-groups to merge with one another.\nApplied throughout the genealogy, this principle divides\nkin into maternally linked groups bounded by paternal links.\nWith some kin types, it isn\u2019t clear which side of the bound-\nary they fall on. Father\u2019s Brother\u2019s Child \u2013 two paternal\nlinks away from Ego\u2019s matrikin and one paternal link from\nFather\u2019s matrikin \u2013 doesn\u2019t obviously belong to either\ninsider or outsider matrikin. The simplest assumption con-\nsistent with the cross-cultural evidence is that this ambigu-\nous kin type can be equated with either a cross cousin, a\nparallel cousin, or a sibling without violating DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN. Its fate must be settled by other constraints. In\nthe Seneca case, the classification of Father\u2019s Brother\u2019s\nChild is settled by the next constraint in the ranking, MINI-\nMIZE COUSINS, which bars the kin type from being equated\nwith any variety of cousin; it ends up instead being classified\nas some type of sibling.\n5. DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN. This constraint is the sex-\nreversed version of DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, treating a\nfather-child link as a bond, and a mother-child link as a\nboundary. In some cases, this and the preceding constraint\nact interchangeably on aunt, uncle, and cousin terms, con-\nsistent with the fact that many societies with patrilineal\ndescent groups, and presumed high rank for DISTINGUISH\nPATRIKIN, have more-or-less the same kin terminology as\nthe matrilineal Seneca. Two separate constraints are\nnecessary, however, because in other cases DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN and DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN have differing\neffects, producing matrilineal or patrilineal skewing. (For\nthe role of these constraints in skewed Crow and Omaha\ncousin terminologies see Jones 2003b. For effects on sex-\nof-speaker distinctions among siblings, see Jones 2010)\n6. DISTINGUISH GENERATIONS. If we go through a\ngenealogy and snip the connections between parents and\nchildren, but keep siblings together, and their spouses\nand cousins, we divide the network of kin into discrete,\nnonoverlapping generations. The corresponding con-\nstraint requires that kin in separate generations be distin-\nguished from one another. Generational distinctions are\nfound in every kin terminology. In some cases, genera-\ntional and sex distinctions are almost the only ones active.2\n7. DISTINGUISH AFFINES. Let a kinship formula consist\nof any number of consanguineal chains (see above), each\nseparated (and maybe preceded and\/or followed) by a\nspouse term. Then DISTINGUISH AFFINES treats any of\nthe links between consanguines (kin by birth) as a bond\nand the links between affines (kin by marriage) as a bound-\nary. It is violated when affines are equated with consan-\nguines, or affine\u2019s affines with either. A low rank for\nDISTINGUISH AFFINES results either in affines merging\nwith consanguines (e.g., Brother-in-law \u00bc Brother) or\nconsanguines with affines (e.g., Mother\u2019s Brother \u00bc Wife\u2019s\nFather), depending on the rank of different markedness\nconstraints. Sometimes DISTINGUISH AFFINES works\nwith other constraints to divide kin into marriageable\nand nonmarriageable classes. In these cases, the machin-\nery for categorizing kin is enlisted to regulate not just\nkin terminology, but also the moral grammar of marriage\nrights and obligations (Le\u00b4vi-Strauss 1969) \u2013 a vast topic\nabout which I will say no more here.\nBy way of conclusion, it\u2019s worth noting how these faith-\nfulness constraints differ from the traditional distinctive\nfeatures found in other work on kin terminology. Specifi-\ncally, the constraints listed above omit the familiar\nlineal\/collateral and parallel\/cross distinctions. The\nresults here suggest that these distinctions are not part\nof the generative machinery in their own right, but\nderive from the interaction of more elementary con-\nstraints. For example, the distinction in English between\nlineal (or direct) mother and collateral aunt (Romney &\nD\u2019Andrade 1964; Wallace & Atkins 1960) results here\nfrom the interaction of DISTINGUISH DISTANCE with\nmarkedness constraints. No extra constraint is needed\nspecifically to enforce the lineal\/collateral distinction.\nThe parallel\/cross distinction, too, may be derivative. In\nthe present analysis, Seneca Father\u2019s Brother\u2019s Child is\ngrouped with Mother\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child as a kind of sibling,\nnot because the two have \u201cparallelness\u201d in common, but\nby default, because the interaction of DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN with other constraints selects an unmarked\nexpression for the ambiguously positioned Father\u2019s\nBrother\u2019s Child. Two faithfulness constraints privileging\nmaternal and paternal links \u2013 DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN\nand DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN \u2013 seem to obviate a third\nspecifically devoted to distinguishing parallel and cross.\n3.2. Three markedness scales\nThere is more to the grammar of kinship than turning dis-\ntinctive features on or off. This is why, after some initial suc-\ncesses, early attempts to define kin categories purely in terms\nof necessary and sufficient conditions ran into trouble.\n\u201cWhole category definitions have the problem of becoming\nextremely complex and hard to follow (and thus cognitively\nunreasonable. . .) and fly in the face of much ethnographic\nusage information regarding focality and the special status\nof focal referents\u201d (Kronenfeld 2006, p. 210). This other\nside of kin terminology can be handled in OT through\nmarkedness constraints and markedness scales.\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n374 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nConsider this neat sequence, from English terms for affines:\nWife wife unmarked\nexpression\nBrother\u2019s Wife sister-in-law markedness sensu\nstricto\nUncle\u2019s Wife aunt syncretization\/\ncontrast\nneutralization\nCousin\u2019s Wife \u00d8 (null\nexpression)\ndefectivation\nThe list shows a series of linguistic phenomena falling\nunder the heading of markedness. Markedness is the lin-\nguistic flip side of cognitive prototypicality: The less proto-\ntypical a concept, the more marked the corresponding\nexpression (Greenberg 1966; 1975; 1990; Hage 2001).\nMarkedness sensu stricto involves converting a prototypi-\ncal expression into a less prototypical one by adding a mark\n(like -in-law, grand-, or step-). Markedness can also take\nother forms, as shown above.\nThe varieties of markedness above fall along a scale. As\ngenealogical distance from Ego increases, less and less\neffort is made to tailor distinctive terms for kin types.\nWife gets a term to herself. Brother\u2019s Wife wears a term\nborrowed from another relative (sister), but altered to fit\nher (with the added suffix -in-law). Uncle\u2019s Wife wears a\nterm borrowed from another relative (Parent\u2019s Sister),\nand not altered to fit her. And Cousin\u2019s Wife gets no\ngenerally accepted term of her own at all.\nThis sequence illustrates a general rule: More terminological\nresources are allocated to closer kin. This can be phrased as an\nimplicational, or if-then, rule about cross-linguistic variation: If\ntwo kin terms differ in markedness, then the more distant is\ngenerally the more marked, other things being equal. In OT,\nthis can be handled by a markedness scale: not a constraint\nper se, the scale limits allowed permutations of constraint rank-\nings. In the case of genealogical distance, the scale stipulates\nthat markedness constraints minimizing distant terms\nshouldn\u2019t rank lower than constraints minimizing close kin\nterms. For example, MINIMIZE COUSINS should rank at\nleast as high as MINIMIZE SIBLINGS, implying that if DIS-\nTINGUISH SEX outranks MINIMIZE COUSINS, it outranks\nMINIMIZE SIBLINGS too. This implies in turn that if a language\nmakes asex distinctionamongcousins, itmakes a sexdistinction\namong siblings, but not conversely. Similar reasoning applies to\nthe relative age distinction. English, Seneca (both compounds\nand roots), and French all conform to these rules.\nNot just genealogical distance, but other distinctive fea-\ntures and faithfulness constraints in Figure 3 have pre-\nferred, unmarked directions associated with them. There\nis good cross-cultural evidence for the following three\nmarkedness scales (Hage 2001):\nA. MINIMIZE FAR KIN \u0002 MINIMIZE NEAR KIN (associ-\nated with DISTINGUISH DISTANCE and DISTINGUISH\nAFFINITY). Cousins are marked relative to siblings, grand-\nparents relative to parents, children\u2019s spouses relative\nto children, siblings\u2019 spouses\u2019 siblings relative to siblings\u2019\nspouses. More generally, given a compound kin type XY\nat a greater consanguineal or affinal distance than either\nof its component types, X and Y, we expect markedness\nscales of the form MINIMIZE XY \u0002 MINIMIZE X and MINI-\nMIZE XY \u0002 MINIMIZE Y. Note that there is no implication\nabout the markedness of XY relative to some other kin type\nZ. For example, Parent\u2019s Parent is marked relative to\nParent, but not necessarily relative to Child.\nB. MINIMIZE JUNIOR KIN \u0002 MINIMIZE SENIOR KIN\n(associated with DISTINGUISH GRADE). Younger siblings\nare marked relative to older siblings. Nieces and\nnephews are marked relative to aunts and uncles. Grand-\nchildren are marked relative to grandparents. More gener-\nally, other things being equal, if X is senior to Ego and Y is\njunior, we expect a markedness scale of the form MINI-\nMIZE Y \u0002 MINIMIZE X.\nDirectional distinctions other than senior\/junior dis-\ntinctions don\u2019t have consistent associated markedness\nscales. Take brothers-in-law. Cultures vary in whether\nthey assign a higher rank \u2013 and more terminological dis-\ntinction \u2013 to the wife-giver who relinquishes a sister, the\nwife-taker who marries her, or neither. There is no univer-\nsal scale of Wife\u2019s Brother relative to Sister\u2019s Husband.\nC. MINIMIZE CROSS KIN \u0002 MINIMIZE PARALLEL KIN\nThis scale is a summary of two scales. One of these, associated\nwith DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, makes Father\u2019s Sister and\nher children marked relative to Mother\u2019s Sister and her chil-\ndren. The other, associated with DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN\nmakes Mother\u2019s Brother and his children marked relative\nto Father\u2019s Brother and his children. More generally, cross\nkin, linked through opposite-sex relatives, are marked\nrelative to parallel kin, linked through same-sex relatives.3\nLanguages mostly follow the markedness scales above,\nbut otherwise they freely invent markedness constraints\nof the form MINIMIZE KIN TYPE as they see fit. For\nexample, both English and Seneca treat aunts and uncles\nsymmetrically, implying they have a single constraint,\nMINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS, regulating these terms.\nBut other languages observe fewer (or more) distinctions\namong aunt terms than uncle terms, implying that they\nsplit MINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS into two constraints,\nMINIMIZE AUNTS and MINIMIZE UNCLES, with the\nformer ranking higher (or lower) than the latter.\n4. Optimality and derivations\nBefore stepping back to assess these findings, consider one\nmore topic: the extension of kin terms to indefinitely\ndistant kin, like second and further cousins. This has\nbeen an important area of research in kin terminology,\nand it may have a wider significance as well. Kin term\nextension involves recursion, and the revision of OT\nneeded to accommodate it may have implications for\ngrammatical recursion more generally.\n4.1. Further cousins\nAs we have seen, Seneca classifies first cousins as cross cousins\nor siblings, depending on the sex of connecting parents. But\nwhat about a second cousin, an Older Mother\u2019s Mother\u2019s\nBrother\u2019s Son\u2019s Son, say? One might imagine that the machin-\nery of kin classification would choke on such a super-sized\ninput, as English does on Cousin\u2019s Wife. But in Seneca the\nrelative in question as ahgareseh \u2013 \u2018cross cousin.\u2019 Other\nsecond-cousin types are likewise classified as cross cousins\nor siblings, with siblings further distinguished by sex and\nrelative age (Lounsbury 1964a).\nIn some cultures, kin term extensions are socially impor-\ntant \u2013 dividing distant kin into marriageable and unmarriage-\nable categories, for example. This doesn\u2019t apply among the\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 375\nSeneca, but the extension of the parallel\/cross distinction to\nmore distant cousins is highly systematic all the same. Anthro-\npologists have developed several approaches to account for kin\nterm extensions in Seneca and other languages, including\nreduction rules (Buchler & Selby 1968; Gould 2000; Kronen-\nfeld 2009; Lounsbury 1964b; Scheffler 1968) and kinship\nalgebra (Read 1984; 2001a). There are important differences\nbetween these approaches (more on this in the next section),\nbut here we are interested in what they have in common.\nBoth offer what linguists call a derivational account of kin\nterms, in which arriving at appropriate terms for distant kin\ntakes many small steps rather than one giant leap.\nThis is very different in spirit from standard Optimality\nTheory. Given an input, standard OT says, \u201cFind the\noutput, whatever it may be, that best satisfies constraints\n1, 2, 3, and so on.\u201d A derivational theory says, \u201cApply\nrule 1 to transform the input. Apply rule 2 (or maybe\nrule 1 again) to transform the result. And so on.\u201d These\napproaches to kin terminology can be reconciled, but\nthis requires a revised version of OT. The revised\nversion says, \u201cFind the output, whatever it may be, in\nthe immediate neighborhood of the input, that best satisfies\nconstraints 1, 2, 3, and so on. Repeat, using this output as\nthe new input. Keep repeating until a steady state is\nachieved.\u201d The journey from input to output, however\nlong, will proceed in small steps.\nBelow I consider how one widely used derivational\napproach, the method of reduction rules, may be incorpor-\nated into OT. First, the sequence below shows how\nreduction rules work on a second cousin input in Seneca\n(following Lounsbury 1964a). On the left are kin formulas,\non the right, rules that transform one formula into the\nnext. It is convenient (but maybe not absolutely necessary)\nto assume that, with each move, at most one pair of adjoin-\ning elementary kin types changes.\nOlder Mother\u2019s Mother\u2019s\nBrother\u2019s Son\u2019s Son\nReduce \u201c___ Mother\u2019s\nBrother\u2019s ___\u201d to \u201c___\nFather\u2019s ___\u201d\nOlder Mother\u2019s Father\u2019s\nSon\u2019s Son\nReduce \u201cFather\u2019s Son\u201d to\n\u201cBrother\u201d\nOlder Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s\nSon\nDon\u2019t reduce \u201cMother\u2019s\nBrother\u2019s ___\u201d to\n\u201cFather\u2019s ___\u201d. Eliminate\nsex and relative age.\n\u2018cross cousin\u2019 (ahgareseh)\nThe last part of the sequence, from Older Mother\u2019s Broth-\ner\u2019s Son to \u2018cross cousin,\u2019 restates a familiar result for first\ncousins. In Seneca, Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Child cannot be\nsubsumed under a sibling term: this would violate DIS-\nTINGUISH MATRIKIN, the constraint keeping adjacent\nmatrilines apart. Further constraints dictate that cross\ncousins are not distinguished by sex or relative age.\nBut something else is going on at the beginning. Here, the\nformula Mother\u2019s Brother is embedded on both sides in a\nlarger formula. And this doubly embedded Mother\u2019s\nBrother is treated differently. According to the rule on the\nright, a Relative\u2019s Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Relative (written \u201c___\nMother\u2019s Brother\u2019s ___\u201d) should be replaced with that Rela-\ntive\u2019s Father\u2019s Relative (written \u201c___ Father\u2019s ___\u201d). This is\nunexpected, because Mother\u2019s Brother and Father belong\nto adjacent matrikin, and in the case of first cousins, aunts,\nand uncles, Seneca is meticulous about keeping adjacent\nmatrikin separate. But apparently when Mother\u2019s Brother is\nburied deeply enough inside a larger expression, the contrast\nbetween adjacent matrikin is neutralized. This is a marked-\nness effect: A distinction observed with one kin type is\nignored when that kin type is part of a larger formula.\nOT is good at managing trade-offs between distinctive\nfeatures and markedness. One might imagine that a con-\nstraint ranking like the following would handle Seneca\ncousin extensions:\nMINIMIZE 2ND, ETC., COUSINS\nDISTINGUISH MATRIKIN\nMINIMIZE COUSINS\nDISTINGUISH SEX\nDISTINGUISH GRADE\nMINIMIZE SIBLINGS\nThis is a portion of the ranking previously given for\nSeneca, with the addition at the top of one constraint,\nMINIMIZE 2ND, ETC., COUSINS, which decrees that\nsecond and further cousin terms must be eliminated\neven at the expense of merging adjacent matrilines.\nBut it takes more than just adding markedness constraints\nto manage kin term extensions. The ranking above gives the\nwrong results if we follow standard practice and allow moves\nof any size. In the present case, one potential move goes\ndirectly from the second cousin input to a sibling type like\n\u2018older brother.\u2019 This move obeys the MINIMIZE COUSINS\nconstraint, and the next two as well, so \u2018older brother\u2019\nshould be the optimal output. More generally, all second\nand further cousins should be classified as siblings. Standard\nOT effectively short-circuits the piece-by-piece replacement\ngiven by the reduction rules above, giving results contrary to\nthose in Seneca and many other languages.\nWe could get around this by declaring, by fiat, that\nDISTINGUISH MATRIKIN extends cross and parallel distinc-\ntions out indefinitely in the appropriate fashion (Woolford\n1984). But there are several problems with this. First, the pro-\nposed redefinition is ad hoc, with no motivation or grounding\nin markedness theory or otherwise. Furthermore, across cul-\ntures there are several different ways of extending the paral-\nlel\/cross distinction, so we would be forced to introduce\nadditional versions of DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN to accommo-\ndate this variation. Finally, it is psychologically and ethnogra-\nphically implausible that a formula like Older Mother\u2019s\nMother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son\u2019s Son is processed in one gulp.\nA better solution is to incorporate the iterated processes\nfeatured in derivational theories into a revised version of\nOT. This means accepting a restriction on the size of\nmoves, but allowing the output to be fed back into the\ninput repeatedly. It means that on any one move, a con-\nstraint like REDUCE 2ND, ETC., COUSINS will accept\n\u201cpartial payment\u201d \u2013 a small move away from second or\nfurther cousin terms, such as replacing an embedded\nMother\u2019s Brother with an embedded Father. Given this\nrevision, we can generate the full array of Seneca cousin\nterms out to indefinite distances. (In practice, the\nSeneca usually gave up after third cousins.) Thus, by\nswitching from one-shot, global optimization to multistep,\nlocal optimization, OT can capture the advantages of deri-\nvational approaches, with the added advantage that deriva-\ntional rules aren\u2019t just stipulated, but derive systematically\nfrom constraint rankings.4\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n376 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\n4.2. Local optimality and minimal moves\nThe case for a more derivational, local version of Opti-\nmality Theory would be stronger if it applied to more\nthan just kin terminology. Encouragingly, both phonology\nand syntax have been moving in this direction lately.\nIn phonology, standard OT, in spite of its successes, has\ntrouble accounting for some phenomena. For example, in\nAmerican English (McCarthy 2007, pp. 1\u20132), it apparently\ntakes two steps to get to the standard pronunciation of\nplanted, the past tense of plant. On the first step, \/pl\u00e6nt\/\nand \/-d\/ are combined, but an extra [ e] is added \u2013 thus\n[pl\u00e6nt. ed]. This avoids the articulatory challenge of pro-\nnouncing two dental stops in immediate succession. But\nunless speakers are being hypercorrect, there is normally a\nfurther change in pronunciation. The [t] is dropped, yielding\n[pl\u00e6n. ed]. The [ e], introduced to solve the problem of a now-\nabsent [t], is opaque \u2013 not motivated on the surface. For a\nderivational account this is not a problem: [ e] is added at\none step, [t] is dropped at the next. But it is a problem for\nstandard OT. What markedness or faithfulness constraints\ncould possibly account for an added [ e] that makes the\noutput both more marked and less faithful to the input?\nProbably the most promising approach to phonological\nopacity within OT involves moving from global to local\noptimization. The argument is set forth at length in\nMcCarthy (2007). In McCarthy\u2019s revised version of OT,\ncandidate chain OT, only minimal moves in the immediate\nneighborhood of the input are allowed. The optimal output\nis selected in this neighborhood, the output is returned as\ninput, and the process is repeated until no more locally\noptimal changes can be made. Optimization takes place\naccording to strictly ranked constraints, as in standard OT.\nAll of this is very similar to the integration of OT and\nreduction rules proposed above for kin terms. For\nexample, in candidate chain OT, some constraints may be\nwritten so that they are activated only after other constraints\nhave been brought in to play. Similarly, with Seneca cousin\nterms, the parallel\/cross distinction is effectual only after a\nformula has been boiled down to a first cousin expression.\nIn syntax as well, linguists have begun to explore loca-\nlized versions of OT. These involve building up phrase\nstructure trees one small step at a time, with each step gov-\nerned by OT (Heck & Mu\u00a8ller 2006; Mu\u00a8ller 2003). This\nresearch has the potential, if preliminary results hold up,\nof reconciling optimality and derivational approaches to\nsyntax, which have grown far apart in recent decades.\nIn short, there is reason to suppose that kin terminology,\nphonology, and maybe syntax have a common architecture\nreflecting the principles of OT. But in each case, there are\nproblems with the standard, global version of OT. It is\nliable to \u201cshort circuits,\u201d getting wrong answers by taking\nbig jumps from marked input to unmarked output. It\nalso gets computationally implausible as combinatorial\npossibilities multiply. The alternative, local optimization,\nmoving from input to final output in small steps, may be\na general design feature of grammar.\n5. From conceptual structure to grammar\nThe study of kin terminology delineates what look like two\npieces of evolved psychology. These work together in regu-\nlating individual learning and cultural evolution of kin terms,\nbut are functionally distinct. They may be phylogenetically\ndistinct as well, with the conceptual structure of kinship\nancient, partly shared with other primates, and evolutiona-\nrily derived from more primitive domains of conceptual\nstructure (Seyfarth & Cheney 2008), and with grammar\nrecent and uniquely human. I review each in turn.\n5.1. Conceptual structure 1: Constraints and the space\nof kinship\nKinship is normally conceptualized in spatial terms.\nKinship maps always utilize a spatial imagery. I have seen no\nexception to this. People around the world commonly speak\nof \u201csides,\u201d \u201clines,\u201d \u201cdistant\u201d or \u201cclose\u201d relatives, and reckon\nrelationships \u201cupward\u201d or \u201cdownward.\u201d Because of this, the\nbest way to capture the conceptual structure of systems of\nkinship definitions without using one\u2019s own cultural con-\nceptions as an obscuring filter is usually to ask for diagrams,\nnot lists. (Leaf 2006, p. 308)\nHere I take this observation a step further by comparing\nthe conceptual structure of physical space, as revealed\nby previous analyses of closed-class linguistic forms, with\nthe conceptual structure of kinship space, as revealed by\nconstraints on kin terms.\nConsider the following scene: There is a focal object or\nfigure. This object stands at some distance and in some\ndirection and orientation in relation to a background\nobject, or ground. The ground is at least as spatially exten-\nsive as the figure. Information about figure and ground is\nlimited, but includes such distinctions as whether they are\nsimplex (a single object) or multiplex (a group of objects\ntreated as one thing). Information about the relationship\nbetween figure and ground is also limited. It is, roughly\nspeaking, topological rather than metric, and digital\nrather than analog. It may include relationships like near\nand far, above and below, or inside and beside, but not\nactual measurements of distance or position.\nThis description could be a representation of material\nobjects in physical space. It doesn\u2019t fit the rich represen-\ntation of objects and space in conscious perception, but\ncorresponds to a more pared-down conceptual represen-\ntation in which most information about shape, texture,\ncolor and kind of objects, and about spatial metrics, has\nbeen stripped away. This mode of representation is mani-\nfest in English spatial prepositions, and across a wide\nrange of languages in a variety of closed-class forms\nconcerned with space (Levinson & Wilkins 2006). But\n(I will argue) this description also fits the conceptual struc-\nture of kinship. The parallels are evident in Figure 3,\nwhere constraints on kin terms are divided horizontally\ninto those concerned with (1) absolute qualities of the\nfigure (the referent of the kin term), (2) the relationship \u2013\ndistance and direction \u2013 between figure and ground, and\n(3) the nature of the ground (the anchoring individual or\ngroup to whom the figure is related).\nTaking these in turn: In the grammar of physical space,\nthe bare, existential thing-hood of the figure is typically\nindicated by assigning it a noun. In kinship space, likewise,\neven though kinship is a relationship, kin types are mostly\ntreated as abstract \u201cthings\u201d by assigning nouns to kin\nterms. (Dahl & Koptjevskaja-Tamm 2001; for scattered\nexceptions where kinship is indicated by verbs, see Evans\n1999.) And in kinship space, as in physical space, only a\nvery limited subset of potentially relevant information\nabout the figure actually registers grammatically. Usually\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 377\nthe only nonrelational information about kin types that\nmakes it into kin terms is their sex.\nThe second class of constraints, those concerned with\nkinship distance and rank, also shows obvious parallels\nwith spatial grammar. For example, in both kinship\nspace and physical space, the grammatical system mainly\ntrades in quasitopological or qualitative, rather than\nmetric, information. Thus age distinctions in sibling\nterms normally encode whether the sibling type in ques-\ntion is older or younger than Ego (as in Seneca), or, less\noften, the sibling\u2019s birth order: first, second, third, and\nso on. They don\u2019t normally encode age differences in\nyears, or absolute ages. Nor do affinal distinctions register\nhow long a couple has been married.\nFinally, to understand what the third class of constraints\non kin terms is up to, we turn once again to parallels with\nthe conceptual structure of physical space. In closed-class\nforms relating to physical space, a commonly registered dis-\ntinction is that between simplex objects (a bird, an island, a\nstar) and bounded collections of objects (a flock, an archipe-\nlago, a constellation) (Jackendoff 1991; Talmy 2000b). The\nsame distinction is at work in kin terminologies: Kin terms\ncan register the relationships of individuals to other individ-\nuals (near or far, higher or lower), but they may also register\nthe relationships of individuals to more extensive back-\nground groups or categories (inside or across the group\nboundary). In the analysis here, three constraints \u2013 those\ndistinguishing matrikin, patrikin, and generations \u2013 are sen-\nsitive not to the relationship between a kin type and an indi-\nvidual Ego, but to the relationship between a kin type and a\nbounded group to which Ego belongs.\nThus the findings here extend one of the major discov-\neries in the study of conceptual structure: kin terminology,\nlike other abstract semantic domains, such as time, change\nof state, and possession, borrows much of its organization\nfrom the conceptual structure of space. What is new here\nis not the idea that we can talk about kinship space and\nkinship distance, but the tracing of close parallels in con-\nceptual structure in both cases. Optimality Theory is an\nimportant part of the analysis, because the distinctive\nfeatures uncovered using OT manifest the parallels with\nspatial cognition especially clearly.\n5.2. Conceptual structure 2: Genealogy and the nature of\nthe input\nThe conceptual structure of kinship has something in\ncommon with other domains of conceptual structure, but\nit has its own logic as well, deriving neither from concep-\ntual structure in general, nor from Optimality Theory. For\nexample, consanguineal distance is measured in a special\nway, starting from neighboring elements and counting\nlinks up and then down. This is more like pedigree dis-\ntance, as measured by geneticists or genealogists, than\nphysical distance as measured by surveyors. This subsec-\ntion considers what\u2019s special about the structure of kin ter-\nminology, with a focus on what the present theory has to\nsay about one of the most contentious issues in anthropol-\nogy, the relationship between kinship and genealogy.\nAnthropologists distinguish between genealogical defi-\nnitions of kin terms \u2013 how genealogical positions map onto\nterms \u2013 and categorical definitions \u2013 how terms are related\nto one another. Up to this point, our application of OT to\nkin terminology has been straightforwardly genealogical.\nThe input to the machinery of kin classification was stipulated\nto be a kin type \u2013 a genealogical formula \u2013 like Mother\u2019s\nOlder Sister. The assumption, never explicitly defended,\nwas that however much kin terms vary, they are built up\nfrom elementary types shared across cultures. An implication\nis that kin terms are intertranslatable: terms from one\nlanguage can be defined using terms from another language\n(sometimes with the addition of extra distinctions, like Older\nor Younger). For example, in explaining Seneca aunt terms to\nan English speaker, one could say that in Seneca, mother\u2019s\nsister but not father\u2019s sister is equated with mother. Conver-\nsely, one could explain English aunt terms to a Seneca\nspeaker by saying that English equates both the ahje (\u2018older\nsister\u2019) and the kaga (\u2018younger sister\u2019) of noyeh (\u2018mother\u2019)\nwith ahgahuc (\u2018father\u2019s sister\u2019) rather than with noyeh.\nBut there are problems with a strictly genealogical\napproach to kin terms. It is commonly observed that\npeople can, and often do, apply kin terms without knowing\nall the genealogical connections involved (Keesing 1975;\nLevinson 2006a; Read 2001b). To see how this is possible,\nnote that a Seneca speaker can figure out that the ahje of a\nnoyeh is a noyeh without actually knowing whether the kin\ninvolved are genealogical or classificatory older sister and\nmother. Another common observation is that in some\nsocieties even an individual known to be unrelated by birth\nor marriage \u2013 a resident anthropologist, perhaps \u2013 may be\nassigned a place as someone\u2019s daughter or brother, and\nthen enfolded systematically into the whole network of kin.\nNongenealogical kinship is not fatal to the OT approach to\nkin terms; it can be accommodated by expanding the range\nof allowed inputs. Specifically, OT can handle nongenealogi-\ncal inputs as long as these are amenable to evaluation by the\nkin term constraints, which are concerned with questions\nlike \u201cIs the input female or male?\u201d and \u201cDoes the input\nbelong to the same generation as Mother?\u201d\nSuppose, given a Seneca constraint ranking, we try the\ninput \u2018mother\u2019s\u2019 \u2018older sister,\u2019 where the terms in single\nquotes are understood, not as genealogical formulas \u2013\nwhat an English speaker might call \u201creal\u201d mother or older\nsister \u2013 but as glosses on Seneca categories. This input is\nwell-formed, because even without knowing the exact gen-\nealogy, we can say that equating the input with \u2018sister\u2019 violates\nDISTINGUISH GENERATIONS, equating it with \u2018father\u2019s\nsister\u2019 violates DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, and so on. Applying\nconstraints as before we get the correct optimal output:\n\u2018mother\u2019s older sister\u2019 merges with \u2018mother.\u20195 Thus pluralism\nabout allowed inputs in OT makes room for both genealogy\nand category. Allowing nongenealogical input is consistent\nwith evidence that people can figure out appropriate kin\nterms using either explicit genealogical reckoning, or termi-\nnological shortcuts, or both, depending on the context.\nSo what does the formal analysis of the language of kinship\ntell us about the relationship between kinship and geneal-\nogy? Many anthropologists argue that, because kin terms\nare often applied where genealogies are unknown or non-\nexistent, a genealogical definition of kinship is unworkable\n(Read 2001a; 2001b). Some go even further and argue that\ndefinitions of kin terms, and theories about how people\nbecome kin and what kin share, are so widely variable as to\ncall into question whether kinship even exists as a proper\nsubject for cross-cultural study (Schneider 1984). According\nto some skeptics, anthropologists should abandon the study\nof kinship for the study of folk ideas of \u201crelatedness,\u201d an\nopen-ended polythetic domain which might not overlap\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n378 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nmuch with Western notions of parenthood and consangui-\nnity (Carsten 1997).\nBut simply dismissing the connection between kinship\nand genealogy in this way means ignoring one of anthropol-\nogy\u2019s great empirical findings: Pretty much every society has\na system of kin terms. These are recognizable as kin terms by\nthe way genealogy maps onto them. \u201cIt is clear that our infor-\nmants quite generally \u2018know\u2019 which genealogical relatives go\nin which kin categories\u201d (Lehman 1993, p. 99). Figure 2\nshows a portion of this mapping for English and Seneca,\nand similar figures can be found in hundreds of articles\nand books on kinship. Somehow, the distinctive features\nthat kin terminologies care about are systematically related\nto genealogical distinctions. According to the present\ntheory, this follows from the restriction that inputs,\nwhether genealogical or categorical, must be well-formed \u2013\namenable to evaluation by the kin term constraints. The\nresult is a systematic correspondence between genealogical\nand kin term distinctions, mediated by the workings of OT,\nso that, for example, a faithfulness constraint concerned\nwith consanguineal distance helps to generate a kin termi-\nnology with a lineal\/collateral distinction (sect. 3.1).\nThere is a paradox here. Kin terms (according to many\nanthropologists) don\u2019t have genealogical definitions, but\n(according to considerable evidence) are genealogically\nstructured. The present theory offers one possible resol-\nution to this paradox: recognizing two levels of mental rep-\nresentation for kinship, corresponding to the content and\nconceptual structure of kin terms. (For content\/structure\ndistinctions in other semantic domains, see Grimshaw\n2005; Pinker 1989; 2007). While the content of individual\nkin terms may vary widely and idiosyncratically across cul-\ntures and be deeply entangled with local theories of pro-\ncreation and shared substances, the conceptual structure\nof kinship manifest in the grammar of kin terms is more\nuniversal \u2013 and shows every sign of being adapted for\ntracking genealogical connections.\n5.3. The grammar faculty\nTalking about kin \u2013 more specifically, using terms for differ-\nent kin types \u2013 is a different problem than thinking about\nthem. Thinking about kin involves fitting one\u2019s thoughts to\nlocal facts about kinship. Mastering a kin terminology\ninvolves, additionally, fitting one\u2019s words to local communi-\ncational conventions. Talking about kin is one example of a\ncoordination game, in which the goal is to choose, not the\none right answer, but the same answer as everyone else.\nPlaying coordination games is something of a human speci-\nalty \u2013 maybe even the key human behavioral specialization\n(Levinson 2006b; Tomasello et. al. 2005). One approach to\nthe grammar of kinship, then, and to grammar in general,\nis to consider its place among games of coordination and\ncommunication (Blutner et al. 2006).\nOne way to play a coordination game involves a kind of\nmind reading, in which signaler and recipient cooperate by\ncarrying out on-the-spot simulations of one another\u2019s\ninferential and performative dispositions (Sperber &\nWilson 1995\/1986). If you and I both know that we are\ntrying to coordinate our behavior, we may be able to\narrive at a shared understanding through one-off signals\nwe mutually recognize as intentional signs obeying\nmaxims of cooperative communication. This kind of\nmind reading allows human beings to cooperate even\nwithout a shared language, as in situations of first\ncontact between cultures.\nSome communicative acts go beyond one-off exchanges\nby reproducing conventional signs. The learning of conven-\ntional signs is governed by further cooperative maxims\n(Bloom 2000). The learner not only connects a sign with a\nmeaning, but also assumes that other members of the com-\nmunity will make the same connection when they interpret\nor produce the sign. She assumes that novel signs have\nnovel meanings, rather than being synonyms of familiar\nsigns (Diesendruck & Markson 2001).\nFinally, conventionalization may go one step further. The\nprecedents set by communicative acts may be generalized to\nproduce systematic rules for encoding information. Human\ncommunication thus runs along a spectrum, from less to\nmore conventionalized, from pragmatic to grammatical.\nThe contrast between pragmatic-inferential and gram-\nmatical-encoded communication is a commonplace in lin-\nguistics. But for many authors, grammar is just a synonym\nfor syntax or morphosyntax (Sperber & Wilson 1995\/\n1986). This article takes a more inclusive approach. Pho-\nnology is grammatical, and, according to the argument\nabove, so is kin terminology. Grammatical principles may\ngovern other semantic fields \u2013 including body parts,\ncolors (Jones 2010; Kay & Maffi 1999), and spatial relation-\nships (Levinson & Wilkins 2006) \u2013 as well as the interface\nbetween semantics and morphosyntax \u2013 including pro-\nnouns and subject choice (Aissen 1999) and verb argu-\nment structure (Legendre et al. 2006) \u2013 and morphology\nand syntax more generally (Legendre et al. 2001).\nTaken as a whole, this work implies that there is more\nto grammar than semantics, phonology, morphology or\nsyntax in isolation. The rest of this article advances a strong\nhypothesis about this extra something, arguing that part of\nthe uniquely human suite of adaptations for playing coordi-\nnation games is a grammar faculty, adapted to facilitate the\nconstruction of locally shared codes of communication and\ninteraction. This faculty interacts with, but is distinct from,\ndomain-specific adaptations in conceptual structure, phonol-\nogy, and syntax. In each domain, the grammar faculty solves\nseveral problems: (1) using ranked constraints to generate\ngrammatical outputs, (2) matching the learner\u2019s constraint\nrankings with community rankings, and, more tentatively,\n(3) discovering constraints. I consider these in turn.\n1. How ranked constraints generate grammatical output\nis well-trodden ground in Optimality Theory. Not so well\nunderstood is why OT works the way it does \u2013 why, particu-\nlarly, it resorts to ranking rather than quantitative maximiza-\ntion to handle constraint trade-offs. The grammar faculty\nhypothesis implies one answer (suggested independently\nby other researchers: Smolensky & Legendre 2006), that\nconstraint ranking is adapted to the demands of communi-\ncation and other coordination games.\nBy way of illustration, consider the functional demands of\ntwo tasks, allocating assistance to kin, and communicating\nabout them. At its simplest, the first task is a matter of house-\nhold economics, of distributing scarce resources among\noneself and one\u2019s relatives. According to a well-known\nresult in evolutionary theory, this can be treated as a maximi-\nzation problem (subject to some restrictions: Frank 1998).\nThe evolutionarily optimal solution maximizes a quantity\ncalled inclusive fitness. The second problem is different.\nGiven the problem of what to call different kin, there is an\nenormous array of possibilities for separating, marking,\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 379\nmerging, and omitting terms. As members of a language com-\nmunity make trade-offs between supplying information and\navoiding effort, the crucial consideration is that they make\nthe same trade-offs. OT solves this coordination problem\nreadily, asking of speakers and hearers only that they share\na constraint ranking. With a shared constraint ranking, the\nSeneca, for example, can settle on Mother\u2019s Sister being\ncalled \u2018mother,\u2019 with further implications for other relatives\n(every Mother\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child is some type of sibling),\nwithout having to precisely equate quantitative feature\nweights or encyclopedic knowledge. Just as particulate\ninheritance in genetics improves the fidelity of replication\nbetween generations, the strict ranking of discrete constraints\nmakes it easier for language communities to reproduce stan-\ndardized codes. Although more theoretical work needs to be\ndone, it is plausible that OT grammars flourish where they do\nbecause of their advantages for communication.\n2. Since constraint rankings vary across cultures, they\nhave to be learned. This process is fairly well understood,\nat least in outline. Given a shared constraint set, language\nlearners can solve the induction problem of generalizing\nfrom limited input to rules of language by using a\nprocedure called constraint demotion to match their con-\nstraint rankings with those in the local speech community\n(Tesar & Smolensky 2000). Briefly, this works as follows:\nThe learner begins with some constraint ranking \u2013 generally\none in which markedness constraints outrank faithfulness\nconstraints. When she hears others speaking in a way incon-\nsistent with her current ranking, she identifies the con-\nstraints responsible for the inconsistency, and moves them\nfar enough down in her constraint ranking to remove the\ninconsistency \u2013 but no farther \u2013 repeating as often as\nnecessary. This procedure converges fairly quickly on the\ncorrect constraint ranking: With n constraints, the number\nof possible constraint rankings, ignoring scales, is n!, but\nthe number of informative examples needed for the con-\nstraint demotion algorithm to work is a manageablen . (n-1).\nApplied to kin terms, constraint demotion implies that when\na child learns that Mother\u2019s Sister is equated with Mother she\nis not just learning a single word. She is also learning a pre-\ncedent that will affect other kin terms she learns. More specifi-\ncally, she is learning that MINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS\noutranks DISTINGUISH DISTANCE, which blocks the incli-\nnation to learn distinct terms for certain more distant kin,\nlike Mother\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child (given the scale MINIMIZE FAR\nKIN \u0002 MINIMIZE NEAR KIN). But not conversely: If she\nhears a Cousin called Sibling, this will not block her learning\nthat his mother is called something other than Mother\n(D\u2019Andrade 1971). The grammar faculty hypothesis thus has\nstill-untested implications for how kin terms are learned.\n3. The grammar faculty faces one further problem.\nAccording to OT, constraints or constraint schemas are\nuniversal. But where do universals come from? This area\nof OT is not well-understood, but we can at least\ncompare two possible kinds of answer.\nConstraints could be innate. In each of the domains in\nwhich grammar operates, language learners might face a\nfixed menu of constraints ready to be ranked. For each\ndomain there would be a separate evolutionary story about\nwhere constraints come from. Applied to kin terms, this\nwould imply that not just the conceptual structure of\nkinship, but actual constraints on kin terms \u2013 or maybe\nmore abstract constraint schemas for space-like conceptual\nstructure \u2013 are built into humans by natural selection.\nThis simple solution is not very plausible for kin terms, or\nin general. In phonology, where the topic has received most\nattention, a recent review concludes that \u201cthe innateness\nhypothesis faces two obstacles: it fails to provide credible\naccounts of either the epigenesis or phylogenesis of [con-\nstraints]\u201d (Bermu\u00b4dez-Otero & Bo\u00a8rjars 2006). The alternative\nis that constraints are neither innate nor culturally acquired,\nbut discovered. Theories of constraint discovery are not as\nwell-developed as other areas of OT, but in general terms,\nconstraint discovery involves a learner\u2019s grammar machinery\nmonitoring her psychological operations \u2013 perceptual, con-\nceptual, and motor \u2013 on the lookout for salient prototypical\nand distinctive features likely to be mutually relevant to\nspeakers and hearers. (Bermu\u00b4dez-Otero & Bo\u00a8rjars, 2006,\nreview several proposals for phonology.) Constraint discov-\nery is a coordination game, with each player trying to zero\nin on a set of constraints likely be chosen by everyone else.\nOn this view, grammar would have a well-defined function,\nbut its scope would be open-ended. Grammars could grow\nopportunistically, colonizing any \u201cgrammar-friendly\u201d cogni-\ntive or perceptual domain in which universals of psychology\nprovide common ground for developing shared codes.\nThus, the study of kin terms does not lead to the discovery\nof one special-purpose module: there is no Kin Term Acqui-\nsition Device. Instead, there is a conceptual structure of\nkinship, partly homologous with conceptual structure in\nother domains, partly of specialized design. And there is a\ngrammar of kinship, bridging the gap between thoughts\nand words with communicational principles of more\ngeneral application. The study of kin terms, in other\nwords, leads beyond kin terms, to \u201cfundamental structures\nof the human mind\u201d (Le\u00b4vi-Strauss 1969, pp. 75, 84).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author would like to thank Paul Bloom, Matthew Denio, Per\nHage, Steven Pinker, and several anonymous reviewers for com-\nments and advice on various stages of this enterprise, and the\nDepartment of Anthropology and the College of Social and Be-\nhavioral Sciences of the University of Utah for support.\nNOTES\n1. Following the example of Lounsbury (1964a), the constraint\nranking for Seneca glosses over the fact that Seneca \u201cwords\u201d for sib-\nlings are compounds, with no sex distinction in the root (Kay 1975).\nThis can be accommodated in an OT framework by using several\nconstraints distinguishing sex, with different ranks. One set of\nconstraints, part of Seneca rules for compounding, automatically\nimposes sex distinctions on a non\u2013self-reciprocal like Older\nSibling, but not on a self-reciprocal like Cousin (roughly she-\nolder-sibling-me or he-older-sibling-me versus we-cousin-each-\nother). Another constraint, closer to kinship semantics sensu\nstricto, handles sex distinctions among roots.\n2. There is not just one, but a family of generational constraints\nactive across cultures. The extra constraints can be assembled out\nof existing constraints using a standard technique from OT called\nconstraint conjunction (McCarthy 2001, p. 18). A conjunctive con-\nstraint combines two constraints; it is violated only ifboth of its con-\nstituent constraints are violated. A constraint active in many kin\nterminologies combines DISTINGUISH GENERATIONS and DIS-\nTINGUISH DISTANCE. This constraint, DISTINGUISH GENER-\nATIONS & DISTANCE, bars any terminological merger of kin\ntypes in different generations at different distances from Ego,\nbut allows child (generation -1) to merge with parent (\u00fe1), or\ngrandchild (-2) with grandparent (\u00fe2). Another conjunctive con-\nstraint, DISTINGUISH GENERATIONS & GRADE, bars any\nJones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n380 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nterminological merger of kin types between ascending and des-\ncending generations, but allows grandparent to merge with\nparent, or grandchild with child. In other words, if two kin types\nm and n generations away from Ego are merged, DISTINGUISH\nGENERATIONS & DISTANCE is happy as long as m and n have\nthe same absolute value, and DISTINGUISH GENERATIONS &\nGRADE is happy as long asm and n have the same sign. Both grand-\nchild\/grandparent and grandparent\/parent mergers are common\nacross cultures (Murdock 1970). In English they are found in the\nprefixes and roots, respectively, of grandkin terms.\n3. The three scales cover most markedness relations in kin ter-\nminology, but not all. Greenberg (1966) suggested provisionally\nthat female kin are universally marked relative to male. But evi-\ndence for this is conflicting; the relationship seems to be reversed\nin some languages, including Seneca (Lounsbury 1964a). Another\nmarkedness gradient entails that elaborated, specific kin types are\nmarked relative to unelaborated and generic: Parent\u2019s Younger\nBrother is marked relative to Parent\u2019s Brother, which is marked\nrelative to Parent\u2019s Sibling. Instead of adding constraints and\nscales to handle this, we can simply stipulate that more specific\ntypes incur more violations of MINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS\nthan less specific types. Finally, gradations of markedness (as in\nEnglish affinal terminology, above) involve the interaction\nbetween markedness scales for kin terminology and other mark-\nedness scales covering varieties of markedness (Jones 2010).\n4. Some complications should be noted. First, we can better\ncapture how markedness constraints generate reduction rules\nin local OT by rewriting MINIMIZE SECOND, ETC., COUSINS as\nMINIMIZE ___ PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS\u2019 ___, which calls for the\ndoubly embedded material to be replaced, with the replacement\nsubject to the remaining ranked constraints. Second, note that in\nthe reduction sequence, Father\u2019s Son is replaced by Brother. In\nthe OT approach, no explicit rule is needed to produce this\nresult, as long as there is no faithfulness constraint explicitly pre-\nventing it, which fits the cross-cultural data. Third, we give the\noptimal replacement for a doubly embedded Mother\u2019s Brother\nas Father. But this follows only if possible replacements are\nlimited to consanguineal kin in the same generation, which in\nturn follows only if two constraints not shown here, DISTINGUISH\nAFFINES and DISTINGUISH GENERATIONS, have a high rank. If\nwe relax this assumption, and give a low rank to either of these\nconstraints, we get various common non-Iroquois terminologies,\nsuch as Dravidian or Crow (Lounsbury 1964a; 1964b).\n5. Not every possible combination of kin terms is a well-\nformed input. A Seneca speaker couldn\u2019t give the correct term\nfor a child of mother\u2019s ahgareseh (\u2018cross cousin\u2019), for example,\nwithout knowing the cross cousin\u2019s sex, which ahgareseh omits.\nThe corresponding input is ill-formed unless information is\nadded to give DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN enough to work on.\nOpen Peer Commentary\nDoes kinship terminology provide evidence\nfor or against universal grammar?\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001913\nChristina Behme\nDepartment of Philosophy, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4P9,\nCanada.\nChristina.Behme@dal.ca\nAbstract: Jones introduces an intricate machinery of kin classification\nthat overcomes limitations of previous accounts. I question whether\nsuch a machinery is plausible. Because individuals never need to learn\nthe entire spectrum of kin terminology, they could rely on data-driven\nlearning. The complexity of Jones\u2019s machinery for kin classification\ncasts doubt on the existence of innate structures that cover the\ncomplete linguistic domain.\nJones claims that his extended framework of Optimality Theory (OT)\novercomes the limitations of previous accounts of kin terminology.\nHis application of the study of conceptual structure to kin terminol-\nogy and his finding that the latter \u201cborrows much of its organization\nfrom the conceptual structure of space . . . [and] the tracing of close\nparallels in conceptual structure in both cases\u201d (sect. 5.1) promises to\nintegrate kin terminology within human cognition.\nIn spite of these promising aspects of the paper, several problems\nremain. First, Jones has given us no new reason to believe that\nkinship terminology has to have a universal grammar (UG).\nTaking kinship UG for granted, he never addresses standard criti-\ncisms of UG in the linguistic domain from developmental (e.g.,\nBehme & Deacon 2008; Edelman & Waterfall 2007; Elman et al.\n1996; Monahagan & Christiansen 2008; Redington et al. 1998;\nSagae et al. 2004; Solan et al. 2005; Tomasello 2003; 2006) or evol-\nutionary (e.g., Arbib et al. 2008; Botha 1999; Christiansen & Chater\n2008; Deacon 2007; MacWhinney 2005; Studdert-Kennedy 1998;\nTomasello 2008) perspectives. While it seems possible that the uni-\nversal rules Jones discusses exist, he has not shown that all humans\nrely on the same innate \u201ctemplate\u201d to assign kinship terms. Given\nthe complexity of constraints and rankings that become already\nevident in the two languages Jones discusses in detail, it appears\nquestionable that the suggested version of OT could apply to all\nexisting human cultures without spiraling into a computationally\nunmanageable system. Nor is it evident how such an intricate\n\u201cmachinery of kin classification\u201d (sect. 5.2) might have evolved\nthough natural selection. The constraints and trade-offs suggested\njust for the small segment of existing kinship terms Jones discusses\ngive a flavour of the complexity required by a system that covers\nuniversally all human societies. And Jones does not even consider\ncomplicating factors such as within language variation of kinship\nassignments, polygamous or same sex marriages, divorce, and\nremarriage. It would appear that kinship terminology needs to\nremain flexible to account for the fluidity of the input, and Jones\ndoes not make it clear how an innate system could offer such\nflexibility.\nJones observes that kin terminology is highly constrained:\n\u201cLanguages around the world have independently hit on similar\npatterns, while largely steering clear of other imaginable possibili-\nties. Kin terminologies are not perfectly regular, but overwhel-\nmingly so\u201d (sect. 2.3). He takes this as support for his theory. Yet,\nit is also possible that kin terminologies are similar because what\nthey describe is similar: There are limits on how human beings\ncan be related to one another, how property can be passed on to\nthe next generation, how sexual relationships (e.g., marriage) can\nbe executed, and more. When learning kin terminology, individuals\nface a very limited specific subset of the potentially possible kin\narrangements. Thus, it is imaginable that they learn the relevant\nkin terms from the input they receive without having to rely on\nan innate system that has to accommodate all possible arrange-\nments. Furthermore, some of Jones\u2019 examples appear to be post\nhoc. Seemingly, we have to know how English and Seneca assign\nkinship terms before we can design the system that accounts for\nthese assignments. Potential counterexamples are then accounted\nfor by invoking additional \u201crules.\u201d Take the Seneca derivation of\n\u201cOlder Mother\u2019s Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son,\u201d which results in \u2018cross\ncousin.\u2019 Jones admits that this violates constraints invoked earlier\nbecause \u201cin the case of first cousins, aunts, and uncles, Seneca is\nmeticulous about keeping adjacent matrikin separate\u201d (sect. 4.1).\nYet, given that \u2018cross cousin\u2019 is the term used by the Seneca,\nJones holds that \u201capparently when Mother\u2019s Brother is buried\ndeeply enough inside a larger expression, the contrast between\nadjacent matrikin is neutralized. This is a markedness effect.\u201d\n(sect. 4.1). It is not clear how Jones\u2019 system could have predicted\nwhen to invoke the markedness effect had we not already known\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 381\nwhat the output is. This holds true even if we accept that Jones uses\na revised form of OT that incorporates iterated processes which\nrestrict the size of moves and allow the output to be fed back into\nthe input repeatedly. It may be true that this revision \u201ccan generate\nthe full array of Seneca cousin terms out to indefinite distances\u201d\n(sect. 4.1). But, given that \u201ccousin terms to indefinite distance\u201d\nhave no practical application in actual language use and that indi-\nviduals often struggle to assign kin terms to distant relatives, it is\nnot clear that such a system exists and how it could have evolved.\nOverall, it would have been helpful had Jones shown how his\nsystem can predict unfamiliar kinship terms after receiving only\npartial input from an arbitrarily chosen language. If those predic-\ntions do not match with the observed terms, it stands to reason\nthat the proposed system has only limited applicability.\nFinally, Jones may be correct to suggest that even though the\ncontent of individual kin terms varies widely across cultures \u201cthe\nconceptual structure of kinship manifest in the grammar of kin\nterms is more universal \u2013 and shows every sign of being\nadapted for tracking genealogical connections\u201d (sect. 5.2).\nHowever, it does not follow without further argument that a uni-\nversal grammar of kin terms exist. Just as the existence of\nlanguage universals has been challenged recently (e.g., Evans\n& Levinson 2009) it remains to be seem whether or not the\nsuggested kinship universals exist. Given that individuals grow\nup in particular communities and thus encounter there one\nspecific subset of kin-terminology the coordination problem\nJones discusses (sect. 5.3) could be resolved by data-driven learn-\ning. Learning kin terminology does not occur in isolation but is\nembedded in a broader context of language learning. Here like\nelsewhere it is plausible to assume that learners rely on multiple\ncues to arrive at the correct solution. And, considering that kin\nterms only cover a very small segment of human cognition, the\ncomplexity of Jones\u2019 proposed machinery needed to handle this\nsegment casts doubt on the existence of innate structures that\ncover the complete linguistic domain.\nSpace, kinship, and mind\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001925\nGiovanni Bennardo\nNorthern Illinois University, DeKalb, IL 60115.\nbennardo@niu.edu\nwww.niu.edu\/anthro\/faculty_staff\/faculty\/bennardo.shtml\nAbstract: In this commentary, I focus on Jones\u2019 suggestion of a close\nconnection between the domain of space and that of kinship. I expand\non that suggestion by introducing the concept of frame of reference\nand show how it can possibly participate to the generation of kinship\nsystems.\nJones makes extensive use of Optimality Theory (OT) to obtain a\nfresh new look at kinship as mental knowledge. OT has been typi-\ncally used in the study of language, mainly phonology, but also\nmorphology, semantics, and syntax. The successful application\nof OT in the study of kinship opens the possibility for Jones to\nspeculate about general principles of human cognition.\nJones himself, though, is eager to point out that OT has funda-\nmental limitations. In fact, he states \u201cAccording to OT, constraints\nor constraint schemas are universal. But where do universals come\nfrom? This area of OT is not well-understood\u201d (sect. 5.3). This very\nimportant issue about OT reminds me of what I regard as a short-\ncoming of Lakoff\u2019s cognitive semantics (Lakoff 1987; 1988. For a\nsimilar shortcoming see also prototype theory, Rosch 1978). Here,\nfundamental organizations of knowledge are pointed out, but how\nthese essential aspects of cognition come to be is left unexplained\n(Lakoff clearly points out that these organizations are rooted in\nour bodily structures, but he does not delineate what kind of\nmental processes are involved at those critical stages).\nWhat is crucial to both approaches (Jones\u2019 and Lakoff\u2019s),\nhowever, is the realization (and suggestion) that spatial knowl-\nedge contributes in a significant way to the organization of\nother domains of knowledge, for example, kinship and others.\nThat is, it appears that some fundamental aspects of the way in\nwhich human mentally organize knowledge about space is essen-\ntially replicated in other domains, and specifically in the concep-\ntual structures module (see Jackendoff 2002, for mental modules;\nand Bennardo 2009, for the significance of space).\nIt is here that I see the relevance of Jones\u2019s analyses. After\ntaking the OT route to the analysis of kinship, he realizes (and\nstrongly suggests) that \u201ckin terminology, like other abstract\nsemantic domains, such as time, change of state, and possession,\nborrows much of its organization from the conceptual structure\nof space\u201d (sect. 5.1). This is a line of thinking that I have\npursued extensively in the last decade (see Bennardo 2009)\nand that I find very productive in elucidating a number of cogni-\ntive phenomena besides supporting a particular mental architec-\nture such a that proposed by Jackendoff (1997; 2002).\nSpace, as an ontological prime, is assigned a module of its own \u2013\n\u201cspatial representations\u201d \u2013 in Jackendoff\u2019s (1997) modular archi-\ntecture of the mind, wherein it is connected to other modules\nincluding the \u201cconceptual structures\u201d one. I expanded on this\nproposal (Bennardo 2009) and argued for a primacy of the\nmental organization of spatial knowledge that is later reduplicated\nin other domains of knowledge, such as time, possession, traditional\nnavigational practices, traditional religion, kinship, and social\nrelationships. This suggestion is also supported from the evidence\navailable in developmental psychology about the very early pres-\nence of complex spatial knowledge in infants (e.g., Mandler 2004).\nJones\u2019 proposal, then, strikes a familiar chord within my line of\nthinking, and it might be of interest to slightly expand on this\npart regarding space. One fundamental content of the \u201cspatial\nrelationships\u201d module is that of Frame of Reference (FoR) (see\nBennardo 2009; Levinson 2003). Choosing a FoR, or perspec-\ntive-taking, is a universal prerequisite of any spatial description.\nA FoR is a set of coordinates (three intersecting axes: vertical,\nsagittal, and transversal) used to construct an oriented space\nwithin which spatial relationships among objects are identified.\nThere are three major types of FoR: relative, intrinsic, and absol-\nute. A relative FoR is centered on a speaker and it remains cen-\ntered on the speaker when the speaker moves; for example, when\none says, \u201cThe ball is in front of me.\u201d An intrinsic FoR is centered\non an object and it remains centered on the object when the\nobject moves; for example, \u201cThe ball is in front of the car.\u201d An\nabsolute FoR uses fixed points of reference, for example,\nnorth, south, east, west, as in \u201cThe town is south of the river.\u201d\nAnd there are subtypes of the absolute that use one axis (e.g.,\nland-sea), or even only one point (e.g., Mecca, sacred mountain).\nIn Bennardo (2009), I labeled this latter type \u201cradial,\u201d wherein\nEgo is back-grounded and other-than-ego is fore-grounded.\nAll three FoRs share some minimal conceptual content like\n\u201cEgo,\u201d \u201cfield of Ego,\u201d \u201cother-than-Ego,\u201d and \u201cvectorial relation-\nship between the two\u201d (toward or away from). For the intrinsic\nFoR, the \u201cother-than-Ego\u201d element has a field different from\nEgo\u2019s, while the other two FoRs use only Ego\u2019s field. Focusing\non Ego obtains the relative FoR, focusing on other-than-Ego\n(in the same field of Ego) obtains the absolute FoR.\nUsing conceptual organizations of space of this type \u2013 that is,\nFoR \u2013 would generate different kinds of kinship systems such as\nclassificatory (with focus on sibling\/s or other-than-Ego) and\ndescriptive (with focus on Ego) (Bennardo & Read 2008). In\nother words, it is the fact that this complex spatial knowledge \u2013\nin the form of FoRs obtained developmentally very early\n(Mandler 2004) \u2013 contributes to the generation of other\ndomains of knowledge that makes an OT approach appear expla-\nnatory (in this case of kinship phenomena). In fact, any FoR, once\ngenerated, may be thought of as a constraint on the generation\nof other knowledge organizations in many domains, including\nkinship. What is clearer though in this case is the fact that we\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n382 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\ncan now see where constraints come from and how they are gen-\nerated from conceptual primes, for example, Ego, other-than-\nEgo, vectors, and so forth (see Levinson 2003, and Lehman &\nBennardo 2003, for spatial primitives).\nI am convinced that works like Jones\u2019 are pushing the field of\nkinship in the right direction, that is, toward a deeper under-\nstanding of the working, both content and structure, of the\nhuman mind.

I certainly have shared his optimism,\nsince I presented an attempt to apply Optimality Theory to\nreligious rituals elsewhere (Biro\u00b4, in press).\nHowever, for this \u201ccolonizing enterprise\u201d to be fruitful, one\nmust establish its goal and match the strategy. OT can\n\u201cconquer\u201d anthropology and cultural studies in three different \u2013\neven if not necessarily mutually exclusive \u2013 ways. Either, OT is\nused as a pure technique; or, an OT-based linguistic model is\nenlarged to also encompass cultural phenomena; or, OT\nbecomes a general model of the underlying brain mechanisms\nshared by language and other realms of (higher) cognition.\nIn what follows, I review these three \u201ccolonizing\u201d directions,\ndiscussing which strategies potential \u201cconquerors\u201d ought to\nfollow, what pitfalls they must avoid.\n1. Optimality Theory as a technique. To most linguists, OT is a\nmodel accounting for observed typologies. For an oversimplified\nexample, imagine that the languages of the world belong to three\ntypes: some always stress the first syllable of the word, other\nlanguages stress the last one, and other again stress the penulti-\nmate syllable; none of them put the stress on the second syllable\nas a rule. This observation-based typology can be explained using\nthree constraints: 1. prefer early stress; 2. prefer late stress;\n3. penalize word-final stress. The six permutations of these\nthree primitive constraints will reproduce exactly the three\nlanguage types, and importantly, this model also correctly pre-\ndicts the lack of the fourth type. (For a longer explanation, see\nBiro\u00b4, in press; or Biro\u00b4 2006, sect. 1.1.)\nSimilarly, if anthropologists decide to borrow OT as a tech-\nnique to account for kinship terminologies, they should first list\nall attested types; then propose constraints; and finally demon-\nstrate that all attested types correspond to some constraint per-\nmutation, but no permutation corresponds to an unattested\ntype. Ideally, the number of types in the exhaustive typology is\nrelatively low, and the number of documented cultures is large\nenough for the difference between attested and unattested\ntypes to be statistically significant. For the model to be convin-\ncing, a few primitive constraints must explain a larger number\nof complex types. Only by keeping this in mind can scholars of\nculture avoid the quick-rise-quick-fall story so typical of many\ntheories borrowing a method from a different discipline.\nAs the number of constraints grows, the number of their per-\nmutations grows factorially. Yet, software tools (among many\nothers, OTKit by Biro\u00b4, available at: http:\/\/www.birot.hu\/OTKit\/)\nhelp exploring such factorial typologies. These tools force the lin-\nguist to be very concrete: the candidate set and the constraints\nmust be explicitly defined. Unfortunately, these two basic build-\ning blocks of OT are only implicit in too many papers, including\nJones\u2019. It is even unclear to me whether he optimizes kinship\nterms or kinship term systems.\n2. Optimality Theory as a tool to include culture into\nlanguage. The history of anthropology in the twentieth century\nwill probably discourage many cognitive scholars of culture\nfrom adopting yet another linguistic theory. Therefore, those\nchoosing this second, \u201ccolonizing\u201d direction, such as Jones,\nmust make clear how the relation between \u201clanguage,\u201d \u201cthink-\ning,\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d is expressed in the proposed model.\nWithin the OT camp, this approach corresponds to including\nnonlinguistic constraints into the linguistic computations, simi-\nlarly to Jones, who adds vocabulary constraints based on anthro-\npological research. However, for a linguist, the lexicon of the\nlanguage is learnt and arbitrary, and it is unclear how one\nwould apply constraints on the lexicon. When an adult speaker\nproduces a sound stream for the meaning \u2018mother\u2019s older\nsibling\u2019s son,\u2019 the candidates are words in the language with\nalready fixed meanings. True, certain logic transpires the\nsystem of kinship terminology, unlike other terminologies; and\nyet, do we have evidence for the distinction between a mother\nand an aunt, between a noyeh and an ahgahuc, being processed\ndifferently from the distinction between a table and a chair, or\nbetween a dog and a monkey? A possible research direction for\nthis approach would be to demonstrate: a child learning the\nrelative importance of \u201cmatrikin distinction\u201d over \u201cdistance dis-\ntinction\u201d in the target language suddenly improves her perform-\nance even on previously unheard kinship terms, but no such\neffect is discernible with the relative importance of \u201cfour-legged-\nness\u201d over \u201csurface color\u201d in other domains.\n3. Optimality Theory as a shared underlying mecha-\nnism. Smolensky and Legendre (2006) demonstrate how OT\ncan describe linguistic phenomena in a way that is not only\ndescriptively adequate, but also computable, learnable, and\nmost importantly, which can be implemented in a neurologically\nplausible network. Convinced that OT and OT-like approaches\n(such as Harmonic Grammar) have the potential to become a\nframework for research on higher cognition in general, and not\nonly in linguistics in particular, Biro\u00b4 (in press) presents a model\nfor religious rituals. Jones (2004) argued earlier for the same\nOT mechanism lying behind social and linguistic cognitions,\nand kinship constraints being neither linguistic constraints, nor\ntechnical analogues: similarly to linguistic constraints, they exem-\nplify the general building blocks of human cognition.\nThis third research strategy entails that we argue for more and\nmore cognitive domains to share OT as a formalism describing\ntheir underlying mechanism. Moreover, the interest shifts from\nplainly reproducing observed facts in higher cognition (language,\nkinship terminology, religious rituals, mathematics, arts, etc.) to\nother aspects of the underlying mental mechanism. For instance,\nto issues such as the time and memory needed to find the best\ncandidate using psychologically realistic algorithms, or the\nerror rate of these algorithms. It may turn out, for instance,\nthat Harmonic Grammar is more plausible as a model than\nOptimality Theory, because the weights are easier to implement\nwith (artificial or real) neurons (Smolensky & Legendre 2006),\nand its implementation is also less prone to error (Biro\u00b4 2009).\nAnthropologists adopting OT must be aware that they are aiming\nat a moving target: The supposedly universal theory of language cur-\nrently varies from linguist to linguist. Nevertheless, I am confident\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 383\nthat anthropologists can contribute to establishing together a solid,\nOT-based model of general human (higher) cognition.\nKinship terms are not kinship\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001949\nMaurice Bloch\nLondon School of Economics, London WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom.\nm.e.bloch@lse.ac.uk\nwww2.lse.ac.uk\/anthropology\/people\/bloch.aspx\nAbstract: The target paper claims to contribute to the conceptualisation\nof kinship but is, in fact, only concerned with descriptive kinship\nterminologies. It uses Optimal Theory to analyse this vocabulary but it\nis not clear if this is to be understood as a psychological phenomenon.\nJones does not make clear how this special vocabulary might relate to\nkinship in general.\nThe field of kinship is broad. It concerns the representations and\npractices, explicit or implicit, conscious or unconscious, which\nare concerned with the genetic links that exist between individ-\nuals. Culture and history lead to wide variation in this field,\nthus genetic links may be represented saliently or not at all.\nThey may have great significance for what people do or only\nlittle. Kinship representations may be represented as a\nbounded set, or be inextricably mixed with representations\nwhich have nothing to do with genetic links or allusions to\nthese. These representations may involve speech acts or not.\nWhen they do, we find among such speech acts what have\nbeen called \u201ckinship terminologies.\u201d The sociologically most\nimportant type of kinship terminologies are terms of address\nsuch as \u201cDad\u201d and \u201cAuntie.\u201d These terms of address do not\nform a closed system and cannot be understood unless taken\ntogether with other forms of address such as pronouns, names\nand other linguistic and pragmatic phenomena. For example, in\nEnglish, parents do not normally use a kinship term of address\nbut first names when talking to their children. Then, there is\nanother group of terms: the so-called descriptive terms. These\noccur when one wants to specify a relationship. In a natural\nsetting, the use of such terms is less frequent than it is for\nterms of address, and it is the descriptive terms which are the\nsubject matter of this paper. My first point is, therefore, that\nthe title of the paper misleads as to the scope of argument\nsince it purports to be \u201chuman kinship\u201d in general.\nDescriptive kinship terms form a bounded set; but this fact is\nmere tautology because of the meaning of the English word\n\u201ckinship.\u201d Whether descriptive kinship terms form a cognitive\nbounded set must remain an open issue and Jones supplies no\nevidence that they do.\nWords that can be called descriptive kinship form a variety of\ndifferent formal systems. There have been a number of proposals\nfor analysing such systems and these are well reviewed here. The\nproposal to use Optimality Theory for such an analysis is convincing.\nThe question, however, is: What is the significance of this? Jones\nclaims to, at the very least, make a contribution to the study of the\nconceptual structure of descriptive kinship terminology. I am not\nquite sure what is meant by this claim. Does it mean that speakers\nsomehow go through the rule procedures implied by Optimality\nTheory when deciding which word to use? If that is the claim,\nthen I regret that Jones presents little or no evidence for such\nmental procedures. The author also claims that the rule procedure\nfor Optimality Theory explains how the child learns the proper use\nof descriptive kinship term. Again this may be so; but he cites no\ndevelopmental study of the learning of kinship terms.\nThe main conclusion of the article is \u201cthat constraints are\nneither innate nor culturally acquired, but discovered.\u201d This\nmay be so; but I would have thought that none of the three pos-\nsibilities exclude each other and probably all three are true.\nEven, in any case, if the paper has demonstrated this, this dem-\nonstration would then apply to all those apparently systematic\nbits of our vocabulary (closed class forms) and the conclusion\nwould be in no way specific to kinship. The article thus does\nnot advance our understanding of the conceptualisation of\nkinship as such.\nThe cognitive path through kinship\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10002050\nFadwa El Guindi\nQatar University, Doha, Qatar.\nFadwa.elguindi@qu.edu.qa\nwww.elnil.org\nAbstract: Integral to the discipline of anthropology are both science and\nholism. The application of Optimality Theory to two partial kin\nterminologies narrows analysis to descriptive value, fragments\nphenomena, and constrains data selection, which precludes significant\nknowledge. Embedded in this critique is a call to move analysis from\nfragment to whole and from descriptive features to deeper levels of\nknowledge underlying kin terms, thereby leading to a cognitive path for\nholistic understanding of human phenomena.\nAnthropology is a robust, four-field science with kinship studies\nat its heart. The title Human Kinship is misleading. It should\nbe Kinship Terminology. Reducing kinship to terms and terms\nto linguistic referents leaves out much of the anthropology of\nkinship. Kin terms are minimally linguistic phenomena but\ncontain social, cultural, conceptual, cognitive, and algebraic\ndimensions as well.\nHuman kinship is broad and multidimensional, encompassing\nmore than selective kin terms from two cultural systems con-\nsidered as linguistic referents. Jones claims that certain kin\nterm\u2013constraining features based on properties of Optimality\nTheory act as faithfulness constraints whose sequential order\nshifts in correspondence with a specific kinship terminology.\nKin terms used are consanguineal with some mention of the\naffinal. Analysis of kinship terminologies, though, must link\nthree universal forms of kinship: consanguinity and affinity and\nsponsorship, each of which is equally and interdependently sig-\nnificant to understanding human kinship. Consanguinity refers\nto relations conceived in some cultures as sharing the biological\nsubstance of blood, while in others (as in Arab kinship\nsystems), it is metaphorically perceived as a human body with\ncomponents linked by nerves or a central nervous system.\nTerms for kin group segmentation among Badawis (Bedouin\ngroups) are corporeal, referring to body parts (limbs, thighs,\netc.) forming a whole. The central notion of \u2018asabiyya,\u2019 translated\nin the literature as \u201csolidarity,\u201d introduced as a core concept in\nthe first, still current, organized theory of kinship formulated in\nthe 14th century by the Arab social philosopher Ibn Khaldun\n(Ibn Khaldun 1961), is a term referring to a state of bondness\nresulting from shared nerves. Only purity of breed is expressed\nin blood terms. All of this challenges the unsubstantiated gener-\nalization that \u201ckinship is normally conceptualized in spatial\nterms,\u201d which misconstrues the reference from Leaf (2006).\nThe second class of kinship, affinity, is formed by ties created\nthrough marriage. The third, which I expediently refer to as spon-\nsorship, is universal and appears cross-culturally in different\nforms such as spiritual parenthood (godparenthood), adoption,\nsuckling, blood exchange, and so forth, with evidence of its pres-\nence in ancient times. All three forms have kin terms that interest-\ningly may differ, overlap, or supersede each other. A current,\nexploratory research study on suckling kinship among Qatari\nGulf Arabs (El Guindi 2009\u20132010) suggests interdependence\namong terms and behaviors in all three kinship domains. The\npresent study prebiases conclusions by only nominally utilizing\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n384 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nin its set of features affinal terms and altogether leaving out\n(perhaps due to deficiency in existing data records) the third form.\nOther concerns include the following:\n1. A claimed universality even though application is only\ndemonstrated for two partial kin terminologies, English and\nSeneca. For instance, Faithfulness Constraint of Sex is based\non a proposed Male-Female polarity. Can the devised system\naccommodate the many ethnographic cases of a \u201cthird sex\u201d\n(Wikan 1978, among other studies)? However, the other polarity\nof bond-boundary has positive potential if developed further.\n2. An asserted homology between kin terminologies (con-\nsidered a linguistic domain) and other domains, such as spatial\nstructure. A homologous conceptual structure enters analysis at\na different level, and hence seems superfluous to the main goal\nof describing the differences among kinship terminologies.\n3. The social and the mental dimensions are assumed to be at\nthe same level of abstraction. Figure 1 in the target article men-\ntions social organization and social cognition. We know that social\norganization exists at the level of society. But what is social cogni-\ntion? Is it being claimed that cognition, too, exists at the level of\nsociety? Is it cognition of the social? Is cognition social? Or is it a\nDurkheimian-style, societally derived or determined cognition?\n4. Ambiguity in the use of the notion of shape: \u201c[shape] is\nabout the structure, rather than content, of kin terms\u201d (sect. 1).\nIs shape the same as form? Is form structure? If so, then concep-\ntual structure as presented is at a low level of abstraction, quite\ndistant from cognitive structure.\n5. Producing an \u201caccount of why kin terminologies have the\nshapes they have\u201d (sect. 1; emphasis added) becomes a partial\ndescription of the physical features of a particular set of data\nfrom Seneca and English kinship terminologies. A selective\ndata pool is insufficient for conclusive generalizations and analy-\nsis of partial data does not automatically lead to understanding\nthe whole. Nor should the whole be assumed.\n6. The author generously borrows [Optimality theory (OT)] and\n[Utility theory (UT)] from other fields (linguistic, economics, etc.),\nand vocabulary such as time, space, cognition, social organization,\nOT, UT, kin terms, shape, conceptual structure, semantic contrasts,\nconstraints ranking, language, markedness theory, open-class,\nclosed-class, faithfulness constraints, markedness scales. These voca-\nbulary borrowings are neither convincingly motivated nor coherently\nlinked. They might serve interdisciplinarity, but do not serve science.\n7. The stated goal that \u201cconstraint ranking defines the\ngrammar of each language, establishing a shared code among\nspeakers and listeners\u201d (sect. 1.2; emphasis added) presumes,\nbut does not take us onto, a road to cognition.\n8. Jones claims that \u201cIn language after language, time is treated\nas a more abstract version of space\u201d (sect. 1), which is substantiated\nby neither ethnography nor theory (see Hubert 1905). Having\nrecently completed an ethnographically grounded monograph on\nthe notion of time and space, I disagree (El Guindi 2008). Time\nand space are equally abstract notions variably manifested in differ-\nent forms. Time has been theoretically dealt with in isolation from\nspace by nonanthropologists and anthropologists alike, until the\nFrench tradition called L\u2019Anne\u00b4e Sociologique (later Annales Socio-\nlogiques), both school of thought and journal, linked the two. It was\nHenri Hubert who lifted both to the appropriate level of abstraction\n(see El Guindi 2008, pp. 32\u201335, for full discussion of this develop-\nment). His ideas formed the foundation for my building a new\ntheory of Islam (El Guindi 2008) based on the concept of rhythm\nas it penetrates time and space.\nHuman systems are complexly integrated. It is difficult to see\nhow deploying OT by identifying a sequential list of features\nreordered to describe kin terms of two cultural systems will\nlead to understanding human cognition. To advance understand-\ning kinship terminologies, we cannot lose sight of anthropology\u2019s\nholism. I argue that analysis of any sociocultural domain using an\nabstract conceptual structure with generative, processual proper-\nties embedded in cultural knowledge will lead more productively\nto a cognitive path (El Guindi 2006).\nWhy do we need to coordinate when\nclassifying kin?\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001950\nDrew Gerkey and Lee Cronk\nDepartment of Anthropology & Center for Human Evolutionary Studies,\nRutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08901-1414.\nagerkey@eden.rutgers.edu\nlcronk@anthropology.rutgers.edu\nanthro.rutgers.edu\nAbstract: We suggest that there are two coordination games when it comes\nto understanding kin terminology. Jones\u2019 article focuses on the linguistic\ncoordination inherent in developing meaningful kin terminologies,\nalluding briefly to the benefits of these kin terminologies for coordination\nin other domains. We enhance Jones\u2019 discussion by tracing the links\nbetween the structure of kin terminologies and their functions.\nJones hypothesizes that the grammar faculty is an adaptation for\nplaying coordination games (sect. 5.3, para. 6), allowing an indi-\nvidual to discover constraints, match his or her own constraint\nrankings with those of other speakers, and generate mutually\nintelligible classifications of kin. Jones does not fully develop an\nevolutionary account that explains why human propensities for\ncoordination games should be applied to the domain of\nkinship, however. In other words: Why do we need to coordinate\nwhen it comes to classifying kin?\nEvolutionary explanations of human kinship often begin with\ntheories of kin selection (Hamilton 1964). As cultural anthropol-\nogists often remind us (Sahlins 1976), however, kin terminologies\nrarely classify kin in ways that correspond with genetic related-\nness. As a result, many cultural anthropologists see kin selec-\ntion \u2013 and evolutionary theory more broadly \u2013 as irrelevant to\nour understanding of human kinship (McKinnon 2005). Focusing\non the role of coordination games in the structure and function of\nkin terminologies may provide a solution to the apparent dis-\nparity between the ways that kin terminologies define relatedness\nand the evolutionary advantages of nepotistic behavior.\nSeveral researchers, including Jones himself (2000), have\nemphasized how kinship enables individuals to identify common\ninterests and coordinate their actions accordingly (Chagnon\n2000; Cronk & Gerkey 2007; Fox 1979; Irons 1981; Van den\nBerghe 1979). We suggest that there are actually two coordination\ngames when it comes to understanding kin terminology. The first\ngame determines whether two individuals can arrive at a mutually\nintelligible and agreed upon term for different kinds of kin. This is\nsimply a specific instance of the broader coordination game pre-\nsented by language in general (Hume 1740; Lewis 1969; Sugden\n2004). The second game builds on the shared meaning of kin\nterms by combining them with cultural norms and values that\ninform how two individuals should act toward kin. Jones focuses\nprimarily on the first coordination game and alludes only briefly\nto the second. Exploring the relationship between these two\ncoordination games may provide a more comprehensive under-\nstanding of the structure and function of kin terminologies.\nEfferson et al. (2008) demonstrated that individuals can spon-\ntaneously use symbolic markers to solve coordination problems.\nAlthough these markers were arbitrary at the start of the exper-\niment, they acquired meaning and became reliable guides for\nsolving the coordination problem when two conditions were met:\n(1) individuals differed from one another in an important but unob-\nservable way, and (2) individuals were allowed to choose markers\nfreely and flexibly (p. 1848). Efferson et al. note that the conditions\nenabling symbolic markers to serve as guides for solving coordi-\nnation games should apply \u201cwhenever people have a shared interest\nin distinguishing among themselves in terms of their unobservable\ninformation\u201d (p. 1848). Identifying kin and interacting with them\noften requires a significant amount of coordination, and kin ter-\nminologies may allow related individuals to distinguish among\nthemselves in the way that Efferson et al. describe.\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 385\nAlthough there is evidence suggesting that kin can to some\nextent recognize one another without kin terms or other symbolic\nmarkers (Lieberman et al. 2007), there are many important ways in\nwhich related individuals differ from one another that are difficult\nor impossible to observe. Genetic relatedness is one such trait, but,\nas Jones rightly emphasizes, there are others. In human social\ngroups, where kinship is often inextricable from economic, politi-\ncal, religious, and reproductive affairs, an individual\u2019s sex, age,\nrank, descent group, and alliances may be as important as\ngenetic relatedness, if not more so. This is because the kinds of\ncoordination problems that humans need to solve involve\ncomplex calculations of costs and benefits in multiple currencies\nthat eventually have consequences for reproductive success.\nThe next step is to investigate how kin terminologies help individ-\nuals solve coordination problems beyond the domain of classifi-\ncation. Alvard and Nolin\u2019s (2002) research on cooperative whale\nhunting in Lamalera, Indonesia, shows how kinship can help\npeople solve coordination games. In Lamalera, descent groups\ncoordinate whaling by providing the equipment, skill, and labor\nthat lets individuals earn greater returns for their effort than solitary\nproductive activities. Whaling crews are composed of related indi-\nviduals, but Alvard (2003) has shown that descent group member-\nship better predicts the composition of whaling crews than genetic\nrelatedness. Unlike genetic relatedness, which varies from individ-\nual to individual in a whaling crew, descent group membership can\nbe the same for all members. Interestingly, research by Nolin\n(2010; in press) shows that the subsequent distribution of whale\nmeat in Lamalera follows genetic relatedness between households.\nLamaleran whalers use descent groups defined by kin terminolo-\ngies to solve the coordination game of whaling, and then they use\nthe logic of kin selection to spread the spoils.\nIf humans possess an adaptation for solving coordination games,\nwe should expect this adaptation also to apply in contexts that do\nnot necessarily involve kin. Efferson et al.\u2019s experimentswithsymbolic\nmarkers support this idea, and there is evidence from other\napproaches, as well. Cronk (2007) conducted experiments in Kenya\nwith trust games that were framed with a reference to osotua, a\nneed-based gift-giving relationship among Maasai. Maasai partici-\npants responded to the framed games in ways consistent with the\ncentral principles of osotua: They were attuned to signs of need, trans-\nferring more money when the other player appeared to need help.\nGiven that Maasai are familiar with the osotua concept, it may not\nbe surprising that the osotua framing influenced how they played the\ngame. However, when the experiment was conducted with Ameri-\ncans who were learning about osotua for the first time, the results\nwere nearly identical (Cronk & Wasielewski 2008). This quick adop-\ntion of osotua norms and values may stem from a broader human\nsusceptibility to being influenced by cultural norms that facilitate\ncoordination. If solving coordination problems has been important\nthroughout our evolutionary history, then we may have developed\nan alertness for and ability to quickly adopt such norms.\nKinship terminology: polysemy or\ncategorization?\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10002062\nLotte Hogeweg, Ge\u00b4raldine Legendre, and Paul Smolensky\nCognitive Science Department, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD\n21218.\nhogeweg@cogsci.jhu.edu\nlegendre@jhu.edu\nsmolensky@jhu.edu\nhttp:\/\/web.jhu.edu\/cogsci\/people\/faculty\/Legendre\/\nhttp:\/\/web.jhu.edu\/cogsci\/people\/faculty\/Smolensky\/\nAbstract: The target article offers an analysis of the categorization of\nkin types and empirical evidence that cross-cultural universals may\nbe amenable to OT explanation. Since the analysis concerns the\nstructuring of conceptual categories rather than the use of words, it\ndiffers from previous OT analyses in lexical semantics in what is\nconsidered to be the input and output of optimization.\nA hypothesis of the target article is that grammar \u2013 as conceived in\nOptimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky 2004) \u2013 is a general cog-\nnitive capacity underlying cognitive universals in a range of cogni-\ntive domains D; the test case is D \u00bc kinship terminology.\nBecause we find the target article unclear or ambiguous on a\nnumber of key points, and because OT\u2019s route to defining a D-\ntheory \u2013 call it T \u2013 is abstract and unfamiliar, we reformulate the\nhypothesis, through a concrete metaphor involving three machines.\nTo determine the name of Mother\u2019s Sister in Seneca, we begin\nwith machine C, which displays the genealogical tree of Figure 2 of\nthe target article (omitting shading and labeling). We select the\nMother\u2019s Sister node of the tree; the machine produces an\nindigo card I containing a bit-string of n 0s and 1s. Next, on the\nmachine G, we insert indigo card I after setting a dial to\n\u201cSeneca\u201d; G produces an orange card O, also containing a string\nof n bits. Finally, on machine V we insert orange card O after\nsetting a dial to \u201cSeneca\u201d;V responds with a word through its loud-\nspeaker (noyeh).\nC is conceptual structure, which is universal (\u00bc not language-par-\nticular): C has no dial. TheoryT provides C\u2019s genealogical graph, the\ntypes of nodes, and so forth. C produces an indigo card I in a univer-\nsal alphabet. Each symbol on I corresponds to the \u00fe(1) or \u2013(0)\nvalue of a feature f k (e.g., +female). T specifies the universal\nmapping from the tree on C\u2019s screen to the bit-string of feature\nvalues on card I \u2013 defining the universal feature-set f f kg.\nG is an OT grammar, which receives indigo-card-input I and\nproduces orange-card-output O. The bit-string on O depends on\nG\u2019s dial setting, a language L \u00bc Seneca. The elements of L are all\nthe different orange cards\u2019 bit-strings that machine G can produce.\nAll points of C that yield the same orange card can be thought of\nas constituting one of L\u2019s D-categories; for example, Mother\u2019s\nSister and Mother are in the same Seneca kinship category.\nV is the vocabulary; it receives G\u2019s output, the orange card O\nrepresenting a category, and, depending on the setting of its\nlanguage dial, produces a distinct name for that bit-string\/cat-\negory.

If no bit-string A is\npreferred to B, then B is optimal; B is the grammar\u2019s outputO. Cru-\ncially, ranking is language-particular \u2013 determined by the G\u2019s dial.\nThus the hypothesis is that a theory T of a domain D can\nprovide all these specifications: Crucially, the universal con-\nstraints in the grammar G which, via OT computation, explain\ncrosscultural patterns in the conceptual distinctions conveyed\nby different languages\u2019 D-vocabularies.\nAt first sight, the outcome of optimization in kinship seems to\nresult in polysemous terms (one word \u00bc several meanings) for\ndifferent kin types. Previous OT work on polysemy has focused\non the optimization of communication by means of polysemous\nterms (e.g., Fong 2005; Hogeweg 2009; Zeevat 2002; Zwarts\n2004; 2008;). A word is assumed to correspond to a fixed set of\nsemantic features. In production (which means word choice in\nthis domain), the input is the meaning a speaker wants to express\nand the candidates are the bundles of features conflated by the\nlexicon of her language. Similarly, when a hearer interprets a\nword, the input is the bundle of features that are stored for this\nword and the candidates are any combination of semantic features.\nThe optimal interpretation for a word will consist of all features in\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n386 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nthe input that are not in conflict with the (linguistic) context. In con-\ntrast, in the target article, an input is an elementary kin type from a\nset shared across cultures (e.g., Mother\u2019s Sister) and the output is a\nkin type with fewer (or the same) marked feature values (e.g.,\nMother), entailing that the complex and simple type share a term:\nnoyeh in Seneca. It appears that noyeh is not polysemous \u2013 it\nsimply refers to Mother, but can be used to refer to Sister\u2019s\nMother because this latter type has first been \u201creduced\u201d to the\nfirst type. From the perspective of the hearer this view would be\nproblematic when the intended meaning was the more complex\ntype: It is not clear by what process a hearer could arrive at the\ninterpretation Sister\u2019s Mother upon hearing noyeh.\nHowever, according to the reformulated hypothesis above,\nthe output of the interpretation is an abstract category subsuming\nboth Mother and Sister\u2019s Mother and the analysis concerns\nthe structuring of conceptual categories rather than the use of\nwords. In other words, where the optimization in the above-men-\ntioned works takes place in machine V, optimization in the target\narticle takes place in machine G. As such, optimization in kinship\nis simply neutralization of featural differences and, surprisingly,\nhas more in common with previous OT analyses in the domain\nof phonology than with OT analysis in the domain of polysemy.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe first author gratefully thanks the Netherlands Organization\nfor Scientific Research for its financial support.\nConceptual structure is constrained\nfunctionally, not formally\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X1000138X\nRichard Hudson\nUniversity College London, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom.\ndick@ling.ucl.ac.uk\nwww.phon.ucl.ac.uk\/home\/dick\/home.htm\nAbstract: Kinship systems are best explained functionally, in terms of the\nconflicting needs of the society concerned, rather than in terms of\nuniversal constraints, whether Optimality Theory or other; but OT is\nparticularly unsuitable as it rules out taxonomies. A conceptual analysis\nof kinship terminology shows, not that \u201cgrammar\u201d extends to kinship,\nbut that general cognition has the formal power to handle grammar.\nJones argues that any kinship system has to find a balance between\nsplitting and lumping \u2013 between the need to distinguish relatives\nwho are different and the need to generalise about those who are\nsimilar. Needs such as these are part of any functional account of\nhow languages change and develop (Nuyts 2007) as \u201cstable engin-\neering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints\u201d (Evans &\nLevinson 2009). It is easy to imagine a functional account of the\ndata that Jones lays out: of why, for example, English lumps\ncousins together while Seneca lumps older sisters with older\nfemale cousins. As Jones says, these differences are probably\nrelated to the social structures of the societies concerned, so we\nalready have an explanation for them. Why, then, do we also\nneed cognitive constraints, such as his proposed OT constraints?\nOne possible argument would lie in the process by which chil-\ndren learn kinship terminology, which, according to Jones, would\nbe speeded up if the child knew the constraints and just had to\nlearn their rankings (sect. 5.3). This argument would work only\nif constraints were innate; but Jones himself thinks this is unli-\nkely. Moreover, we don\u2019t need innate constraints to explain\nhow the learning of one term and its meaning might facilitate\nthe learning of a later term. An even easier explanation is that\nthe later term\u2019s meaning incorporates the meaning of the\nearlier one. For example, when a child learns to lump a mother\ntogether with her sister, as in Seneca, a concept is created that\ncan then be recycled in lumping together siblings and cousins.\nAnother possible argument would be that the constraints \u201cgen-\nerate\u201d (as Jones puts it) a limited range of kinship systems,\nthereby explaining why only these are found; similarly, but at\nthe level of the individual, once a child has learned the correct\nrankings, the child\u2019s mind \u201cgenerates\u201d the correct meanings for\nthe language\u2019s potential kinship terminology. But once again\nthe explanation fails if not only the rankings but even the con-\nstraints themselves have to be learned. And once again alterna-\ntive explanations are easily available: Languages have only\nthose kinship systems that are socially useful, and children\nlearn only the terminology to which they are exposed.\nMy conclusion is that general cognitive constraints on kinship\nterminology are redundant. Kinship systems themselves evolve\nunder social pressures in a society and are best explained in\nterms of the social, communicative and cognitive benefits to indi-\nviduals of learning to lump and split in one way rather than\nothers. If kinship systems in different societies show differences,\nthat is because different pressures apply to different human\nsocieties; and if there are limits to this variation, it is because\nthese societies are subject to similar social pressures.\nAs for kinship terminology, this evolves to fit the kinship\nsystem, so once the system is explained, we are already heading\nfor an explanation for the terminology. It\u2019s true that the fit may\nbe imperfect; for example, there may be gaps in the terminology\nsuch as the lack of an English equivalent for the everyday\nGerman word Geschwister, meaning \u201csibling.\u201d However, it\nseems unlikely that any general constraint could predict this\ndifference between English and German. (One explanation we\ncan\u2019t give is that a term isn\u2019t needed because the concept\ndoesn\u2019t exist in the English kinship system; this must be wrong\nbecause we can only define \u201ccousin\u201d in terms of \u201csibling,\u201d as\nthe child of a sibling of a parent.)\nIf constraints of all kinds are redundant, there\u2019s little point in\ndiscussing the merits of particular proposals for constraints such\nas the OT account that Jones develops. However, it is worth point-\ning out one general limitation of the OT mechanism when applied\nto the mapping between concepts and words. At least as presented\nhere, it seems to exclude the possibility of a taxonomic organis-\nation of meanings. For instance, if the ranking of DISTINGUISH\nSEX explains why we have to distinguish mothers from fathers,\nhow can we accommodate the term parent? The fact is that, at\nsome points, languages typically give us a choice between splitting\nand lumping; so we can either split our mother from our father, or\nwe can lump them together as our parents. These lumped con-\ncepts don\u2019t seem to be covered by Jones\u2019 analysis, but they play\nan important part in the English system because we recycle\nthem in defining more distant relatives following the pattern\nsuggested above for \u201ccousin\u201d; so an aunt is the sister of a parent\nand a grandfather is the father of a parent.\nIn spite of these reservations about the approach that Jones takes,\nI agree totally that \u201cThe study of kin terms . . . leads beyond kin\nterms to \u2018fundamental structures of the human mind\u2019\u201d (sect 5.3).\nKinship terminology has featured in some of my own work\n(Hudson 1996, pp. 85\u201388; 2007, pp. 237\u201338; 2010, pp. 47\u201350)\nas an example of what I call \u201cI-society,\u201d our mental representation\nof society, comparable with Chomsky\u2019s \u201cI-language.\u201d Like Jones,\nI believe it is important to consider the conceptual structures that\nwe use for kinship, and to consider what they tell us about the\nmind and about language. But my argument runs in the opposite\ndirection from his. Whereas he finds a \u201cgrammar\u201d in kinship ter-\nminology, I find structures like those of kinship in grammar; for\nexample, as he points out, both kinship and grammar allow recur-\nsion. Moreover, my conclusion is that if our minds can cope with\nthe complexities of I-society, then they also have the ability,\nwithout any specialised \u201cmodules,\u201d to cope with the complexities\nof language (Hudson 2009; 2010, pp. 50, 160).\nIn short, the best explanation for the facts of language, includ-\ning kinship terminology, is not OT or any other theory specific to\nlanguage, but a general theory of cognition combined with a\ngeneral theory of the functional demands of communication.\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 387\nKin term diversity is the result of multilevel,\nhistorical processes\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001962\nFiona M.

We argue that his framework can more usefully\nbe applied at the levels of developmental and historical change, the\nlatter especially. A phylogenetic approach to the diversity of kinship\nterminologies is most urgently required.\nKinship is unique as a domain of human experience for which we\nhave a vast cultural and linguistic record. That record has lan-\nguished unattended for too long, and Jones is to be commended\nfor his attempt at reinvigorating kinship studies towards the under-\nstanding of our species-typical cognition. We have many points of\nagreement with the program laid out in the target article (and else-\nwhere: Jones 2000; 2003a; 2003b; 2004), especially with the\ngeneral scientific aim of generating testable hypotheses from\nmodels and theory and seeing what the data have to say.\nWe agree with Jones that there are shortcomings in many\napproaches to kinship terminologies (sect. 2.3). None of these\napproaches provides a workable model that really captures\nwhat is going on in people\u2019s heads when they \u201cdo kinship\u201d \u2013 or\nwhat goes on in speech communities when kinship terms\nchange. Optimality Theory provides an ingenious approach to\nthese problems, and the OT constraints that Jones proposes are\nfor the most part plausibly motivated: They are based on univer-\nsals of human experience, and they articulate human social\npriorities in the domain of kinship.\nA weakness of Jones\u2019 account is that it is not clear about the\ntimescale (or timescales) on which this kinship-directed version\nof OT operates. Within linguistics, OT is invoked at the timescale\nof online processing (McCarthy 2007b). Jones uses OT at this\nproximate level but also discusses OT as part of ultimate,\n\u201corigin\u201d explanations (cf. coordination games and the evolution\nof language, sect. 5.3). We question the plausibility of using OT\nat these two markedly different timescales and find it more satis-\nfying to think of a generalised model operating in language acqui-\nsition and change. Kinship terminologies are semantic systems\nused by speech communities to coordinate social behaviours,\nand therefore in our view the relevant timescales at which the\nconstraint rules of kinship operate are developmental \u2013 how do\nchildren acquire their culture-specific set of constraints and\nthen employ them in the life course? \u2013 and historical \u2013 how do\nthose culture-specific constraint arrangements change over time?\nThese two timescales are crucial components for good expla-\nnations of linguistic diversity. The variation in kinship terminol-\nogy across human societies is not random (sect. 1) because, as\nJones himself has outlined (Jones 2003a), it reflects Darwinian\nconcerns \u2013 for example, sex, status, group membership, and so\nforth. There is a very small cross-cultural literature on the acqui-\nsition of kinship terminology, but developmentalists are unre-\nsolved on the relative importance of semantic complexity in kin\nterms versus the importance of the child\u2019s exposure to sets of\nrelatives as referents (Benson & Anglin 1987; Ragnarsdo\u00b4ttir\n1997). In any case, to the extent that there are reliably recurring\npatterns of human infant experience, ontogenetic processes may\nfurther constrain the available variation. Most important, in any\nsociety the kinship terminology has a history: Individuals are\nnot acquiring a terminology from, and languages are not con-\nstructing a system from, a space of infinite variation. This then\nimmediately reduces the amount of variation that needs to be\naccounted for by the OT framework. Just as evolutionary devel-\nopmental biologists have recognised the importance that both\ndevelopmental constraints and historical evolutionary processes\nplay in explaining organismal diversity (Breuker et al. 2006), so\ntoo are both important in understanding evolved diversity in\nkinship terminologies.\nEvolutionary diversification produces hierarchically related\ntaxa, and because these taxa cannot be considered independent\ndata points, biologists have developed a range of computational\nphylogenetic methods that take history into account for compara-\ntive analyses. These methods have been successfully applied to\nlinguistic and cultural evolution as well, notably with the con-\nstruction of large-scale language phylogenies (e.g., Gray & Atkin-\nson 2003; Gray et al. 2009; Holden 2002; Kitchen et al. 2009).\nThese trees provide statistical models of population history\nwith which we can investigate cultural evolution: Hypotheses\nabout coevolution, rates of change, directional models, ancestral\nstates, borrowing, and the mode of evolution can all be addressed\n(e.g., Gray et al. 2007; Mace et al. 2005). Many studies have\nfocused on kinship traits (Fortunato & Mace 2009; Holden &\nMace 2003; Jordan et al. 2009), and we have begun to apply\nthese methods to kinship terminologies in Austronesian and\nBantu to test sequential models of sibling term evolution that\nare implied by markedness theory (Jordan, in press; forthcom-\ning). We think that Jones\u2019 program holds the most promise if\ncombined with a comparative phylogenetic approach that is\nimplemented at the level of language change. One productive\nintegration would allow us to detect if the outputs of constraint\nrerankings over time (i.e., rule changes throughout a language\nfamily) correlate with the empirical data when phylogeny is\ntaken into account.\nThe constraints Jones proposes (Fig. 3 of the target article) are\nrelatively uncontroversial as a starting point for describing the\nraw conceptual material, but historical affordances will deter-\nmine the nature of how these play out in different language\ngroups. Arguments about the primacy of these basic constraints\ntherefore must wait until the empirical work is done. We need\nto understand the processes that have generated the observed\ncross-linguistic variation; these can inform speculation about\nwhat might be species-typical. As with other domains such as\ncolour (Kay & Regier 2003) or the human body (Majid et al.\n2006) the nature of variation needs to be understood before we\ncan make any grand or ultimate claims about universality and\ninnateness in cognitive mechanisms. One of the attractions of\nthe OT framework is that despite Jones\u2019 presentation it doesn\u2019t\nrequire our buy-in to any universal \u201catomic structures\u201d of\nkinship (sect. 1). They may exist, but we don\u2019t need to appeal\nto them to explain the historically derived patterns of kinship ter-\nminologies across languages.\nSome facts of Seneca kinship semantics\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001391\nPaul Kay\nInternational Computer Science Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA\n94704.\npaulkay@berkeley.edu\nwww.icsi.berkeley.edu\/\u223ckay\nAbstract: Jones\u2019s analysis of Seneca kinship semantics gets some of the\nfacts about close relatives wrong, and his mechanism for extending the\nanalysis to distant relatives does not work.\nJones\u2019 analysis of Seneca kinship is inadequate.

To account for\nmore distant relatives, Jones suggests, but does not provide, a set of\nrewrite rules intended to reduce more distant kin relations to those\njust listed. The OT analysis correctly classifies the restricted set of\nkin relations in Ego\u2019s and the first ascending generation to which\nit is applied, but fails on the close kin of the first descending gener-\nation (children, nephews, nieces). The full model, relying on the\nkind of reduction rules Jones suggests, cannot correctly classify\nthe more distant kintypes.\nFor his OT analysis of close kin, Jones does not consider the first\ndescending generation, that of Ego\u2019s children and niblings (nieces\nand nephews). Here the OT analysis fails. Ego\u2019s sister\u2019s child is a\nmember of Ego\u2019s matriline, regardless of Ego\u2019s sex. So according\nto Jones\u2019s OT constraint ranking, in which DISTINGUISH\nMATRILINE outranks all other relevant constraints, Ego\u2019s\nsister\u2019s children are classed with Ego\u2019s children. In Seneca they\nare not. A man\u2019s sister\u2019s child is not classed with his children\nbecause a man and his sister are of opposite sex. Matriline member-\nship is irrelevant. The classification of a man\u2019s sister\u2019s child as a cross\nrelative exemplifies a semantic distinction that governs the classifi-\ncation of all of the infinity of kintypes in Ego\u2019s and the two adjacent\ngenerations in Seneca. Parallel collaterals are merged terminologi-\ncally with Ego\u2019s lineals or siblings (henceforth, for convenience,\n\u201clineals\u201d tout court) of the corresponding generation; cross relatives\nare terminologically distinguished from Ego\u2019s lineals. This perva-\nsive distinction, to which we now turn, is implicit in Lounsbury\n(1964) and explicit in Kay (1975).\nThe Iroquois cross-parallel distinction is given in (1).\n(1) Lineal relatives (including siblings) are Iroquois parallel.\nTwo collaterally related kintypes are parallel iff the furthest sep-\narated, same-generation nodes on the genealogical path connect-\ning them are of the same sex. Collateral relatives that are not\nparallel are cross.\nThe definition is most easily unpacked in terms of the tra-\nditional terminology of English cousin numbering. The children\nof siblings are first cousins, the children of first cousins are\nsecond cousins; the children of nth cousins are (n\u00fe 1)th\ncousins. These are the \u201cintegral\u201d cousins, cousins of the same\ngeneration. For nonintegral cousins, two relatives are ith\ncousins j times removed iff one is an ith cousin of a jth generation\nancestor of the other ( j . 0). What counts for the Iroquois cross-\nparallel distinction, is the relative sex of the \u201cith\u201d cousins (or sib-\nlings). Iff that pair of integral cousins or siblings are of the same\nsex, Alter is a parallel relative of Ego.\nLooking back at the subset of relatives analyzed by OT, mother\u2019s\nsister and father\u2019s brother are parallel, and mother\u2019s brother and\nfather\u2019s sister are cross because of the relative sexes of those\nsibling pairs. No mention of matriline membership or of minimiz-\ning-kinterm-sets is necessary. Similarly, in Ego\u2019s generation, the\nfirst cousins whose respective parents are of the same sex are paral-\nlel and therefore merged with siblings; those whose respective\nparents are not of the same sex are cross and therefore not so\nmerged. Again issues of matriline membership and\/or minimizing\ncousin versus sibling categories are otiose. In the first descending\ngeneration, alter is classed with Ego\u2019s children (parallel) iff he or\nshe is the child of Ego\u2019s same-sex sibling. Classifying in this gener-\nation on the basis of matriline gets the facts wrong.\nSeneca kinship terminology extends outward from Ego indefi-\nnitely in Ego\u2019s and both adjacent generations. Jones is aware that\neven in Ego\u2019s and the first ascending generation classification of\nmore distant relatives, for example, second cousins, on the basis of\nmatriline membership doesn\u2019t work. He proposes an unspecified\nset of reduction rules, which, successively applied, are intended to\neventually rewrite longer kintype expressions to the small set ana-\nlyzed by OT. (Since the OT analysis on offer does not work for\nany descending generation, we must imagine a new OT analysis\nthat works for a small subset of first descending generation kintypes,\nto which an infinite set of kintypes will be reduced by the reduction\nrules.) These rules are by definition local. \u201cIt is convenient (but\nmaybe not absolutely necessary) to assume that, with each move,\nat most one pair of adjoining elementary kin types changes\u201d (sect.\n4.1, emphasis added). The single example given reduces a genealogi-\ncal path by application of two rules, each replacing two adjacent\nnodes with a single node that shares either the sex or the generation\nof one of the nodes it replaces. But no set of such local rules can\naccount for the Seneca cross\/parallel facts because the Seneca\ncross\/parallel distinction is based on the relative sex of two arbitra-\nrily separated nodes, the two most distant same-generation nodes.\nFor example, Ego\u2019s father\u2019s mother\u2019s father\u2019s mother\u2019s brother\u2019s\ndaughter\u2019s son\u2019s son\u2019s child is terminologically classed as Ego\u2019s\nsibling because Ego\u2019s father and alter\u2019s father are of the same sex.\nNothing else matters.\nOne could of course imagine rewrite rules that looked at nonad-\njacent nodes. Or one might perhaps add some condition(s) on\nstrictly local rules that would have this effect. But any such moves\nwould just come down to a needlessly complicated notational\nequivalent of the definition of Iroquois cross-parallel given in (1).\nThat definition effects the accurate classification of all Seneca kin\nin the relevant generations, without recourse to (a) separate form-\nalisms for close and different kin, (b) ordering of constraints (OT),\nor (c) reduction rules. No set of local reduction rules of the kind\nJones hints at can do the job because the key dependency is nonlo-\ncal. Additionally, the OT analysis of the finite subset fails on the\nfacts in the first descending generation. The rejected model, l\u2019il\nol\u2019 componential analysis, gets the whole job done accurately with\nless machinery (Kay 1975; Lounsbury 1964).\nLanguage and kinship: We need some\nDarwinian theory here\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001974\nChris Knight\nProfessor of Anthropology, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.\nchris.knight@live.com\nwww.chrisknight.co.uk\nAbstract: Common to language and kinship is digital format.

What\u2019s needed here, however, is some Dar-\nwinism. If we\u2019re to come up with a testable model, we need to\nspecify at least some details of the \u201ccoordination games\u201d we envi-\nsage our evolving ancestors to have been playing. Sex isn\u2019t just in\nthe head, any more than are costly burdens such as pregnancy,\nbirth, lactation, or childcare. Behavioural ecology is the relevant\ndiscipline here, dealing as it does with the costs and benefits of\nreal biological strategies operating in the real world.\nAt some point during the evolution of our species, sex and repro-\nduction became subject to the rule of law (Knight 2008; 2009). Like\nany legal system, a formal kinship system is designed to minimize\nscope for disputation: It does this by eliminating shades of grey.\nYou are either a sister or a wife; to a relative of the opposite sex,\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 389\nyou can\u2019t be somewhere in between.

If humans are to\ncoordinate their efforts in defining and enforcing the law, they\nmust necessarily draw distinctions in this way.

These affect\nthe convincingness of his kinship study, and thus the wider conclusions\nthat he wants to draw regarding human cognition and language.\nIt is always interesting to see a new approach emerge \u2013 especially\nin an area as long studied as kinship terminologies. Our under-\nstanding of terminological systems has benefited from the\nmultiple and diverse perspectives represented in the analytic\nwork of Lounsbury (1964a; 1964b), Romney (1965; Romney &\nD\u2019Andrade 1964), Read (2001a), and Gould (2000), among\nothers, and I hope comparable contributions will come from\nJones\u2019 approach. But for that contribution to be realized some\nfurther information is needed, beyond what is in this paper. In\nwhat follows I highlight some of the major needs.\nFirst, major innovative contributions in this area have come\nout of detailed formal treatments of complete systems \u2013 versus\nonly illustrative examples. Jones does provide such an account\nfor part of Seneca, but not for the part that is most distinctive\nand of most theoretical interest \u2013 the range of cousins out\nbeyond what we call first cousins. He does address the issue,\nbut only in a thin programmatic way \u2013 a way whose success\ndoes not seem inevitable or obvious.\nSecond, the Seneca detail is important because it is in that detail\nthat Iroquois-type systems (including Seneca) differ from Dravi-\ndian-type ones. And that difference is very important because Dravi-\ndian-type terms (and thus cross\/parallel determinations) map cleanly\nonto some social groups such as moieties, while Iroquois-type ones\nabsolutely do not (see Lounsbury 1964a). In this sense, \u201cmatriline\u201d\n(sect. 4.1) seems much more relevant to Dravidian than to Iroquois.\nIn a paper such as the present one, complete analyses of a number of\ncontrasting systems is too much to ask, but one would like to have\nseen some illustrative detail concerning how the two types would\neach be dealt with, and thus the two distinguished.\nThird, a similar problem is posed by Crow- and Omaha-type\nsystems (sometimes spoken of as \u201cskewed\u201d systems) in which\nbasic kinterm categories systematically cross generational lines\n(see Lounsbury 1964b). The comment about lowering the rank\nof DISTINGUISH GENERATIONS in note 4 does not do it,\nfor the same reason that the treatment of Seneca cousins did not.\nFinally, there is the \u201cwhat does it buy you?\u201d question. The rel-\nevance of the paper to the linguistics and universals of thought\nissues that open and conclude the paper depends on the success\nof the kin terminology analysis. What is the task whose success is\nat issue? That is, we already have in kinship approaches that rep-\nresent semantic contrasts, approaches that model native speaker cal-\nculations, approaches that facilitate cross-system regularities and\nthus define types, approaches that clarify the relationship of ter-\nminologies to social features, and approaches that aid the inductive\nprocess of finding a system\u2019s regularities. What analytic or theoreti-\ncal kinship questions does this new approach particularly speak to?\nI look forward to seeing treatments of these issues in future\npublications.\nPragmatic and positivistic analyses of kinship\nterminology\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001986\nMurray J. Leaf\nSchool of Economic Political, and Policy Sciences, University of Texas, Dallas,\nRichardson, TX 75083-0688.\nmjleaf@utdallas.edu\nwww.utdallas.edu\/\u223cmjleaf\/\nAbstract: Jones\u2019 article suggests that the anthropological analysis of\nkinship has followed a single line of development based on a single\nunderlying conception of meaning and method. In fact, there have\nbeen two opposed lines of development. Jones\u2019 conception is\npositivistic. The other is pragmatic. Pragmatic theory is superior on\nevery recognized criterion. This briefly describes the differences.\nJones assumes a referential theory of meaning drawn from eth-\nnoscience and logical positivism. He cites Dwight Read and me\nwithout recognizing that we argue for a very different, pragmatic,\nconception (Leaf 1971; 2007; 2009; Read 2001; 2007). Pragmatic\ntheory is demonstrably more parsimonious, precise, and\npowerful.\nReferential theories are set up in terms of words and their\nreferents. Pragmatic theories are set up in terms of ideas and\ntheir uses. Jones offers a list of universal parameters for classify-\ning what kinship terms refer to and justifies it by invoking the\nsupposed success of OT in linguistics. Read and I, by contrast,\nhave demonstrated (not just suggested) that terminologies are\nsystems of interrelated definitions, and that their internal order\nderives from computational rules contained in the core of\nterms that define the \u201cdirect\u201d relations around the user, or self.\nReferring to relatives is just one of the many uses of such concep-\ntual systems.\nJones begins by distinguishing two levels of language: \u201cordin-\nary\u201d and \u201cVIP.\u201d Ordinary is \u201copen class or lexical,\u201d which\n\u201cincludes most nouns and verbs.\u201d He describes VIP as \u201cclosed-\nclass\u201d but otherwise only by example. The examples are gramma-\ntical markers. He puts kin terms in the VIP class. It is a crucial\nstep in the argument, and it is unjustifiable. Languages have\nmany closed classes, including classes of nouns and verbs.\nKinship terminologies do form closed systems, but not classes\nin this sense.\nJones then argues that grammar uses spatial and temporal\nimagery, and this is also true of kinship terminologies. Quoting\nme, he notes that kinship terminologies always use spatial\nimagery. Such spatial categories appear to him to be innate,\nbut their relative weight can vary. The order in which such cat-\negories dominate one another act on random linguistic (referen-\ntial) variation to produce the patterns of meaning in any given\nterminology.\nJones\u2019 Figure 2 offers his comparison of English and Seneca.\nThis represents only three generational levels: self, the one\nabove, and the one below. Both terminologies define more pos-\nitions than these, and more importantly both use categories\nthat Jones\u2019s analysis cannot recognize because they are cultural\nand local.\nIn fact, terminologies can be represented comprehensively.\nThis can be done at several levels of abstraction, beginning\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n390 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nwith the kind of diagram produced during field elicitation that I\nhave called a \u201ckinship map\u201d (Leaf 1971) and carrying through\nalgebraic reconstructions demonstrating their underlying gen-\nerative rules. I have published the kinship map for English pre-\nviously, contrasting it with Punjabi and addressing the same\nissues of spatial representation that are relevant here (Leaf\n2006; 2009, p. 92). Read (1984; Read & Behrans 1994) has\ndemonstrated its mathematical logic, and Read and Fischer\nhave constructed a computer analysis that can regenerate it\nand any other system that is available on the Internet with the\nKinship Analysis Expert System (Read 2006).\nThe English terminology has three important features that\nJones\u2019s analysis obscures or misses entirely, and that OT\napparently cannot encompass. First, positions can be extended\nvertically forever: Just keep adding the prefix \u201cgreat.\u201d The\nsame number of prefixes mark the reciprocal terms. Jones\nrecognizes generation, but not the idea of extensibility.\nSecond, by contrast, in the horizontal direction \u201ccousin\u201d is a\nboundary. There is no relation beyond cousin. All terminolo-\ngies must logically have boundaries in order to be closed,\nbut Jones does not recognize the problem of finding them.\nAnd third, cousin in English is actually not specific to a\nsingle generation, so generation as a constraint does not dom-\ninate all others.\nEvery kinship terminology defines kinship in its own specific\nway based on its own conceptual contrasts. There are resem-\nblances but no precise universals. The English idea of being\nrelated is strongly associated with the idea of common ancestry.\nTo produce it, the terms consistently distinguish lineal versus col-\nlateral relation, sex, and generation in the direct descent line\nonly. Outside the direct descent line, the terms distinguish only\nwhether one is a sibling or sibling-spouse of a lineal or a descen-\ndant of such a sibling-spouse. The idea of an ancestor who is not a\nrelative is a self-contradiction.\nSeneca is indeed very different. Figure 1 is the kinship map for\na female self (indicated by the gray circle). I have constructed it\nby asking the table of terms in Morgan\u2019s Ancient Society for defi-\nnitions beginning with the core positions around self, just as I\nwould have asked a group of live informants. Despite two\nterms that appear to be variant pronunciations of a single\nname, the consistencies emerge clearly.\nHere, the \u00fe2 and -2 generations are boundary positions.\nThe terms for the \u00fe3 and -3 generation are the same, although\nSeneca recognize individuals who are their more distant ances-\ntors. So the second feature is that an ancestor is not necessarily\na relation. The third conspicuous feature is that positions form\ngroups based on a specific contrast between own matrilineal\nclan as against all other clans \u2013 not \u201cmatrikin.\u201d Own brothers\nand sisters are grouped with mother\u2019s sister\u2019s children and con-\ntrasted with all other relations on one\u2019s own generation. Chil-\ndren of ha-nih (father and father\u2019s brother) who are also\nchildren of own mother are in own sibling group, children of\nother ha-nih are in the all others group. The same logic\napplies on the -1 generation. Finally, the difference between\nthe male and female terminologies is that in the male terminol-\nogy own children are grouped with other children of males on\none\u2019s own generation, which Morgan does not explain but\nwhich seems to emphasize again the importance of the differ-\nence between descent through males and descent through\nfemales \u2013 as did Iroquois political organization. What the\nterms consistently distinguish are generation, clan, mother\u2019s\nand father\u2019s side, marital versus descent relation, sex of\nspeaker, and sex of linking relative.\nSeneca terminology embodies Seneca social conceptions\njust as English terminology embodies English social conceptions.\nSeeing how they do so brings us face to face with the cultural and\nsocial basis of thought itself. Empirically unnecessary speculation\non the possibility of innate ideas is a distraction.\nAdvancing our grasp of constrained variation\nin a crucial cognitive domain\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X1000141X\nStephen C.

Humans are the\nFigure 1 (Leaf). Seneca, Female Speaking\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 391\ncategorizing species, and kinship systems categorize our own\nmost significant others, so reflecting fundamental forms of\nsocial organization. In small-scale societies, kinship forms the\nbackbone of the political and economic organization, and even\nin complex societies, it plays a significant role (Kuper 2009).\nMoreover, kinship is one of two primordial foundations for rela-\ntional cognition \u2013 the other being, as Jones notes, spatial\nrelations (kinship identifies a person by a relation to Ego;\nspatial relations identify a place relative to a landmark, where a\nplace is rather more abstract than a person). Advanced relational\nreasoning is the big divide between us and the other primates:\nEven our cousins the chimps have a hard time doing relational\nthinking (Penn et al. 2008). It is likely that language and relational\nreasoning are mutually implicated, although which provides the\nfoundation for the other is controversial (Loewenstein &\nGentner 2005). Many small-scale societies have such complex\nkinship systems that they have exercised professional mathemati-\ncians, while still being mastered by kids.\nSo, Jones has done us a big favor by putting kinship back on the\ncognitive science agenda with an interesting new twist. It has long\nbeen obvious that despite exuberent variation in the kinship\nsystems of the world, there seem to be a limited set of underlying\ntypes (see, e.g., the important work by Godelier et al. [1998], unfor-\ntunately not referenced by Jones). Jones gives us a very neat way to\nthink about this pattern in the diversity, in terms of differentially\nranked principles for grouping and distinguishing kin. Previous\napproaches, such as componential analysis and reduction rule\nanalysis (see Tyler 1969 for a range of approaches), have each cap-\ntured part of the phenomenon but somehow have failed to give us\nan exhaustive way to think about the typology of kinship systems. A\ncomponential analysis, for example, might characterize cousin as\n\u00fecollateral, \u00fesame generation, unmarked for sex, while brother\nmight be \u00felineal, \u00fesame generation, \u00female (Romney &\nD\u2019Andrade 1969), while a reduction rule analysis might tell us\nthat a mother\u2019s brother\u2019s son\u2019s son is like a mother\u2019s brother\u2019s\nson, so counts as a kind of (less prototypical) cousin.\nJones\u2019 system uses just eight \u201cfaithfulness constraints,\u201d or\ninstructions, to group or individuate kin of different kinds, which\nare further constrained by three \u201cmarkedness constraints\u201d giving\nus implicational scales of the kind \u201cif you distinguish different\nkinds of cousins, you should distinguish different kinds of siblings.\u201d\nWhat this actually amounts to is a way of formulating metacon-\nstraints over componential analyses of different kinship systems.\nIf you reorder his constraints, some distinctions will be made\nand others not \u2013 so you can\u2019t have all your cake and eat it too.\nThe markedness constraints will ensure that there is, for\nexample, a greater lumping of distant kinsmen and greater splitting\nof close kinsmen. The whole system of Jonesian constraints then\nacts to constrain the possible componential analyses available to\nkinship systems. This looks as though it might be a major\nadvance in the typology of kin term systems, although it will\nneed testing on a representative sample of the exuberant variation\n(if there are 7,000 languages in the world, there are 7,000 kinterm\nsystems, even if many of these will prove isomorphic \u2013 note\nthough that Tamil, for example, has a dozen or more distinct kin\nterm systems adapted to the different castes: See Levinson 1977).\nNow, this system doesn\u2019t capture the notion of prototype\nkin and their extensions, so nicely captured in the reduction\nrule analysis of Lounsbury (1969), and argued for on psychological\ngrounds by Malinowski. Here Jones plans an addition to the OT\nframework with a recursive application of the constraints. It is\nhard to see exactly what the implications for typology might be,\nbut it must multiply the possibilities enormously, so undermining\nsome of the attractions of the OT approach. It would seem better\nto keep separate the categories from the algorithms that assign\nreferents to them, for the simple reason that we know that individ-\nuals use more than one manner of assigning kin to categories\n(Levinson 2006). This implies that the prototype structure of kin\ncategories should form part of the primary category structure,\nnot part of the assignment algorithm.\nA major issue though is the psychological reality of all this. This is\nthe Achilles\u2019 heel of OT analyses, which are typically derived by\ndetailed comparison across languages: They are thus constructed\nwith all the metalinguistic hindsight of the (hypothetically) omnis-\ncient analyst. It is quite unwarranted (despite the normal claims of\nOT) to think that any one native speaker has this kind of meta-\nknowledge in his or her head. To learn a kin term system a child\nstarts off by learning \u201cnames\u201d for those around her, then grasps\nthe relational character (other kids have \u201cmoms\u201d too), then\nlearns the extensions \u2013 and kin terms are one domain of language\nwhere explicit instruction and correction are common (see Hirsch-\nfeld 1989 for review). Thus an individual can learn to use the\nsystem without having an overview of how it works. Kinship\nsystems are a wonderful example of culture as the second great\ninvisible watchmaker \u2013 intricate systems without a designer.\nThey are honed by cultural evolution, can be exceedingly\ncomplex like the Australian systems, and because they have to\nserve important social functions of regulating reproduction and\nsocial conduct, they are directly under selection by the social\nsystems they must integrate with. Jones\u2019 constraints, if they cor-\nrectly capture the typology of extant kinship systems, may do so\nnot because the categories are antecedently in our mind, but\nbecause these are the ones that societies need to work with.\nJones\u2019 paper bristles with other interesting ideas. Particularly\ninteresting, perhaps, is the idea that kinship systems have a\ndigital character \u2013 unlike the analog (or gradient) nature of\nutility functions \u2013 because they are solutions to communicative\ncoordination games. Here as elsewhere, Jones perhaps fails to\ndraw a sharp enough line between kin term systems (linguistic in\nnature) and kinship systems (systems of reproduction, marriage,\ninheritance and authority). Note how the kin-selection metric\n(Hamilton\u2019s rule) does not map neatly onto any known kin term\nsystem \u2013 a Seneca cousin, for example, is treated as equal to\nEgo\u2019s sibling, even though the cousin shares 12.5% of his or her\ngenes with Ego and the sibling 50%. In some ways the kin-term\nsystem will regulate the kinship system (e.g., in the kind of behavior\nappropriate to categories), but in other ways (e.g., inheritance) the\ntwo may part company. The kin-term system is part of the language\nand communication system, the kinship system is part of a social\norganization. Insofar as they are coincident, and kinship is\ndigital, this is part of the magical power of language to construct\nthe categories of our world (Levinson 2003).\nExploring the conceptual and semantic\nstructure of human kinship: An experimental\ninvestigation of Chinese kin terms\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001366\nChao Liu,a,b Yue Ge,a Xiaoqin Mai,c and Yue-Jia Luoa\naState Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal\nUniversity, Beijing, 100875, China; bDepartment of Psychology, University of\nMichigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1109; cCenter for Human Growth and\nDevelopment, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1109.\nliuchao@umich.edu\ngeyue818@163.com maixq@umich.edu Luoyj@bnu.edu.cn\nwww-personal.umich.edu\/\u223c liuchao\/index.html\npsychbrain.bnu.edu.cn\/teachcms\/luoyuejia.htm\nAbstract:We designed an experiment to test the application of optimality\ntheory (OT) in kinship terminology studies.

However, his arguments focus mainly on the lin-\nguistic aspects of OT and kinship representation and relatively\noverlook the cognitive aspects, such as: How does the human\nmind process kin terms and what are the behavioral conse-\nquences of these processes? As cognitive psychologists, here we\nprovide a discussion of the OT from a behavioral approach.\nSpecifically, we focus on the filterlike OT constraint ranking prin-\nciples Jones proposes and use an experimental design represent-\ning the kinship space to examine how the five linguistic OT\nconstraints Jones proposes fit our behavioral data using\nChinese kin terms, and how these results could modulate the\nconstraint ranking principles.\nOne key feature of the OT, according to Jones, is that con-\nstraints \u201cact as filters on randomly generated variation, with\neach constraint weeding out variants that violate it . . . each con-\nstraint strictly dominating lower ranking ones\u201d (sect. 1; emphasis\nours). From a cognitive psychology perspective, this assumption\nof serial filtering processes has big implications for how people\naccess and process the meaning of kin terms at different con-\nstraint ranking levels. Because cognitive resources are always\nlimited (Halford et al. 1998), kin terms filtered by constraints\nranked higher should be processed differently than those filtered\nby constraints ranked lower, thus resulting in different behavioral\npatterns for kin terms that are governed by different constraint\nlevels. We argue that this cognitive hypothesis is an important\nextension of Jones\u2019 approach, allowing us to examine the cogni-\ntive mechanisms underlying linguistic OT principles.\nTo test this hypothesis, we proposed to (1) develop a behavior-\nal task that can measure kinship representation; and (2) apply the\ntask to a language with kin terms complex enough to distinguish\nbetween constraints and constraint rankings.\nBehavioral task: The Five Elements Kinship Identification\n(FEKI) task. All possible kinship relationships in three gener-\nations can be represented by a schema of \u201ckinship space\u201d with\nfive elements that distinguish SEX, GENERATIONS, DISTANCE\nand Relative age (Liu et al., submitted) (Fig. 1, left). The one\nelement in the first generation represents the grandparent unit;\nthe two elements in the second generation are siblings and rep-\nresent parental units; whereas the two elements in the third gen-\neration are not siblings but corresponding offspring of the second\ngeneration, and represent child units. In the experiment, partici-\npants first saw this schema with only a prime unit (indicated by a\ncircle outline) that was randomly presented around one of the\nfive elements; then another schema was simultaneously shown\nwith a prime unit and several male or female target units. The\ntask was to orally report the kinship term representing the\nrelationship between the prime unit and the farthest target unit\n(e.g., four female units in Fig. 1 left represent mother, grand-\nmother, aunt and cousin, respectively).\nChinese: A language with complex kin terms. Chinese has a\nvery complicated kin term system (Kroeber 1933). In Chinese,\nkinships are distinguished by SEX, DISTANCE, GRADE,\nPATRIKIN, GENERATIONS and AFFINES, resulting in 33\nkinship terms in modern Mandarin Chinese without affines.\nThis number increases dramatically with affines and marks. For\nexample, Huang and Jia (2000) listed 52 Chinese kin terms\nwith affines, whereas Chen and Shryock (1932) identified a\ntotal of 270 terms with affines and marks. For decades, this com-\nplicated kinship terminology system has not received much atten-\ntion from anthropologists using traditional descriptive methods.\nHowever, we argue that Chinese kinship terms provide a rich\nand previously untapped resource in kinship terminology\nstudies and accordingly, in the current discussion, we use\nChinese kin terms to test the filter-like OT principle.\nWe examined the five faithfulness constraints proposed by\nJones using reaction time (RT) data obtained from 22 Chinese\nspeakers with the FEKI task (Fig. 1, right). DISTANCE. RTs\nincreased with four kinship levels, p , 0.001, which is mostly\ndue to the Distance difference. SEX. Sex differences were\nfound only in level 3, between uncle terms (shu, bo, jiu) and\naunt terms (gu, yi), p , 0.05. PATRIKIN. Differences\nbetween Patrikin terms were found only in level 4, such that\ncousin terms in the father-child side with prefix \u201ctang-\u201d received\nfaster RT than those in the mother-child side with prefix \u201cbiao-\u201d,\np \u00bc 0.09. GENERATIONS and MARKEDNESS SCALES.\nWe found significant effects of Generations between contrasts\nof Grandparents vs. Grandchild in level 2, p , 0.05, and\nParent\u2019s Sibling versus Sibling\u2019s Child in level 3, p , 0.01.\nThese Generation effects also intermingled with Markedness\nscales effect. The RTs of kin terms with marks (e.g., \u201cwai-\noutside\u201d and \u201cnu\u00a8- female\u201d for Grandchild and Sibling\u2019s Child)\nwere slower than those without marks (e.g., Grandparents and\nParent\u2019s Sibling). GRADE. We did not find significant difference\nbetween Relative age, the only Grade constraint (see sect. 3.1 of\nthe target article) distinguished in Chinese.\nAs implied by the filterlike OT principle Jones suggests, kin\nterms governed by different constraints (e.g., DISTANCE,\nGENERATION, PATRIKIN, SEX and Relative age) indeed\nshowed different behavioral patterns, although they all are distin-\nguished in Chinese kin terms. How do these behavioral results\nmoderate the constraint ranking principles? We suggest that con-\nstraints that yield more RTs differences should be ranked higher\nthan those that yield fewer differences. According to the assump-\ntion of serial filtering processes, constraints ranked higher might\nFigure 1 (Liu et al.). (Left) An illustration of the Five Elements Kinship Identification (FEKI) task.

Comparing\nthis result from behavioral approach with the one from the lin-\nguistic approach used by Jones may provide interesting insights\ninto the underlying mechanism of why Jones\u2019 OT constraints\nwork, and perhaps even how they work.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Ellen Newman for comments.

Lyon\nDepartment of Anthropology, Durham University, Durham DH1 3LE, United\nKingdom.\nS.M.Lyon@durham.ac.uk\nwww.dur.ac.uk\/s.m.lyon\nAbstract: The choice of emphasis in kinship studies has often resulted in\nincompatible theoretical models of kinship that are mutually undermining\nand contradictory. Jones\u2019 attempts to reconcile disparate approaches to\nkinship using OT is useful, however; seeing kinship as a specialized\nsystem for representing genealogy may be unwarranted in the light of\nrecent advances in mathematical approaches to kinship terminologies.\nJones\u2019 contribution to kinship is remarkably persuasive and coher-\nent. He draws together relatedness-centric approaches to kinship\n(for example Carsten 1997) with what might be understood as\nmore mathematical or formal approaches to kinship (see for\nexample Goodenough 1965; Read 2001). Within sociocultural\nanthropology there seems to be something terribly attractive in\nseeing and understanding the use of kinship as merely an\nadjunct of relatedness in some fuzzy and poorly defined situa-\ntional sense. Jones astutely deals with the mathematical regularity\nthat appears to be pervasive in kinship terminologies while\nattempting to account for empirically demonstrable inconsistency\nand ambiguity in kinship instantiation.\nIt is logical and predictable that simple (and self-consistent)\nsystems produce complex, inconsistent clusters or relationships;\nhowever, the reverse is highly improbable and perhaps impossible.\nJones is well aware of this and skillfully suggests that the innate con-\nceptual structure of kinship (the part with the demonstrable math-\nematical regularity), is subject to principles of optimal grammatical\ncommunication present more generally in language. Optimality\nTheory (OT), Jones argues, renders inconsistency in observed\nusage comprehensible despite what would appear to be strong\nrestriction on the range of algebraic models present in real societies.\nKinship is of course not alone in demonstrating that persistent con-\nceptual structures may be modified by grammars of communication.\nJones makes an intriguing argument about kinship borrowing\nits conceptual structure from that of space; however, rather\nthan being useful for describing physical space, kinship-space is\na specialized genealogy-representing tool. Jones seems to be\nmaking a similar argument to Bennardo (2009), except that\nwhereas Bennardo begins with space and attempts to demon-\nstrate how culturally specific conceptual models of space are fun-\ndamental to a broad range of knowledge domains, Jones instead\nappears to begin with kinship and notes the pervasive spatial\nreferents that appear to form part of the logic of kinship itself.\nBennardo\u2019s work has the advantage of more elaborated formal\nmodels of space, while one of the great strengths of Jones\u2019 contri-\nbution lies precisely in his attempt to reconcile radically different\nanalytical conceptualizations of kinship.\nWhile I must admit to being largely persuaded by Jones\u2019 mas-\nterful analysis, nevertheless, there is perhaps one important\npoint of concern worth noting. The conflation of kinship with gen-\nealogy has a very long history within anthropology (going right\nback to Morgan and arguably earlier), and while Jones is very\ncareful to avoid any clumsy conflation, he nevertheless argues\nsomewhat forcefully that kinship systems are spatially informed\nconceptual systems that are highly specialized for representing\ngenealogy. It is self-evident that kinship is used by people for\nordering genealogical relations; however, there seem to be some\ndangers in such an argument. First, that genealogy somehow\nbecomes reduced to reproduction and subsequently to possibly\nmisleading sociobiological arguments about simplistic Darwinian\nforces operating on kinship via genealogy. Following from this, the\nrisk that correlation coupled with longstanding folk beliefs about\nkinship result in erroneous attributions of causation. Unquestion-\nably, there are constraints on kinship just as there are constraints\non genealogy, but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that\ngenealogy takes the form it does because of the particular form,\nor structure, of kinship systems, which are themselves the result\nof fundamental constraints on ordering, or relation-creating\nknowledge systems produced by human cognition.\nAttempting to understand genealogical ordering through an\nanalytical set of terms a priori assumed to be organizationally hom-\nologous is precisely the problem that leads to the unease with\nkinship studies in the first place (see Leaf 1979 for a more\nfulsome discussion of the move away from rigorous formal\napproaches to kinship). Read (2006), Fischer and Read (2005),\nand Leaf (2005) have recently demonstrated that a number of\nkinship terminologies can be produced without reference to any\nnotion or instance of genealogical relatedness. In other words,\nthe kinship terminologies themselves are constrained by something\nthat has no need for any reference to genealogical relatedness. This,\nthen, renders the idea that kinship is somehow a highly specialized\nsystem for representing genealogy more than a little problematic. If\nthe system can be produced without reference to genealogy then it\nseems at the very least one must consider that genealogies take the\nforms they do because of the independent kinship terminologies\nused by the societies in which they are produced.\nFinally, one might, following Bennardo, make a similar case for\nnotions of space arguably being independently constrained by\nmore rudimentary principles of reciprocity and recursion and\nsuggest that it is indeed genealogy that is the entirely dependent\nvariable in the equation. Such a concern, to be sure, does not\nnegate the significance and utility of Jones\u2019 application of OT\nto make sense of a more comprehensive view of social ordering\nin societies; rather, it suggests that while Jones is right to try to\nmake sense of such phenomena in their entirety, he may inadver-\ntently reinforce a demonstrably unsound assertion that genealogy\nis somehow driving kinship terminologies.\nGetting the constraints right\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001998\nPatrick McConvell\nAustralian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.\nPatrick.McConvell@anu.edu.au\nAbstract: While the idea of applying Optimality Theory to kinship has\npotential, this commentary draws attention to problems with the\nconstraints proposed.

The OT approach can also model change\n(Anttila & Young-Mee 1998), predicting which rerankings of con-\nstraints are possible diachronically, and relatedly, where two\nvariant sets of kin equations cooccur, as in the \u201coverlay\u201d analysis\nof skewing (equations between adjacent generations; Kronenfeld\n2009; McConvell, in press).\nOne of the key desiderata of OT is a universal and robust set of\nconstraints. In this article, some of the constraints incorporate ques-\ntionable assumptions. For example, constraints such as DIS-\nTINGUISH MATRIKIN are said to lie behind the Seneca system of\nclassificatory kinship, with its distinction between cross and parallel\nkin. DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, although not rigorously defined,\nappears to refer to relationships ofdescent, specifically matrilineality.\nLounsbury (1964\/1969 pp.193, 210) analysing the Seneca case,\nrefers to the \u201cclassic but erroneous anthropological view concern-\ning the \u2018Iroquois\u2019 type of kinship systems . . . that this kind of\nsystem classifies kin by membership in unilineal descent\ngroups.\u201d Recognition of this error, and the strong distinction\nthen drawn by Lounsbury between \u201cIroquois\u201d and \u201cDravidian\u201d\nsystems, was a breakthrough in kinship studies, further elaborated\nby Scheffler (1971). It is disappointing to see a constraint appar-\nently so closely related to this same error in this article.\nLounsbury (1964, p. 210) pointed out, \u201cthe classic [erroneous]\ntheory predicts correctly only to the immediate (closest) uncles\nand aunts . . . and first cousins. Beyond this its predictions are\nhalf right and half wrong.\u201d In this article we are initially presented\nwith data from the immediate kin only, so the problem is not mani-\nfest. Once we go beyond that, though, we encounter contradictions\nbetween unilineal descent lines and the Iroquois\/Seneca system.\nIn an \u201cIroquois\u201d system, for example, the child of female Ego\u2019s\nfemale cross cousin is classified as Ego\u2019s son or daughter, even\nthough that child is not in the same matrimoiety or matriclan as\nEgo; presumably this violates DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN. Child of\nfemale Ego\u2019s male cross cousin, on the other hand, is Ego\u2019s\nniece\/nephew (brother\u2019s child).This pattern is in contradistinction\nto the \u201cDravidian\u201d pattern of naming cross cousins\u2019 children and\nother relations which does match well with lineal institutions.\nWe see some more distant kin discussion later in the target\narticle. The application of Lounsbury style \u201creduction rules\u201d to\nsecond cousins, Older Mother\u2019s Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son\u2019s Son\nreducing to Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son, includes a reduction of\nMB to F, a transgression of DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN and appar-\nently ad hoc. This is part of the derivational apparatus imported\nto \u201cfix up\u201d OT constraints to generate correct terms for extended\nkin. The list of constraints used, however \u2013 prominently DIS-\nTINGUISH MATRIKIN \u2013 may be at the root of the problem. The\nstring \u201cMother\u2019s Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son\u2019s Son\u201d (MMBSS) con-\ntains the same substring \u201cchild of female Ego\u2019s male cross\ncousin\u201d (MBSS) as one of the examples discussed above.\nWoman\u2019s MBSS, we saw, is classified as \u201cbrother\u2019s son,\u201d in an Iro-\nquois system, hence MMBSS is reduced to MBS without resort\nto replacing MB by F in the derivation.\nWhat this points to is that the relevant constraint in an OT system\nmust directly cope with such reductions, and not miss the mark as\nDISTINGUISH MATRIKIN does, or have to be propped up by impor-\ntation of Lounsbury-style rules. More globally, the Iroquois and\nDravidian systems include many minor variants in how cross- and\nparallel kin are defined. There is a need for a constraint, or family\nof constraints, which allows for such variation to be captured by con-\nstraint rankings. The distinction between cross cousins and parallel\ncousins (the latter equivalent to siblings) exists in many systems, uni-\nlineal and not. In some form it is certainly a candidate for universal\nconstraint status \u2013 the \u201cclassificatory\u201d principle in kinship as\nMorgan termed it. A related constraint could be DISTINGUISH\nCROSS\/PARALLEL However variations on this compute the same-\nsex\/opposite-sex metric in different ways. This is not the place to\nelaborate, but I am simply illustrating that different ways of imple-\nmenting OT constraints in kinship are open.\nConstraints should be made up of very basic transparent par-\nameters and not draw in notions from outside that like descent. If\nthis methodological principle is followed, it is then possible to\ncompare occurrence of terminological patterns with other pat-\nterns such as lineal descent. If the two are combined in the\nbasic mechanisms such comparisons are compromised.\nDebate about the appropriateness of proposed constraints is\ngoing to be needed to lay a firmer foundation for the further\ndevelopment of this initiative. I would advocate disposing of\nany constraint like DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN. Its meaning is not\nclear, but even if it could be clarified, the patterns it is trying\nto explain have nothing really to do with \u201cmatrikin.\u201d\nThe sections attempting to construct a place for kinship in a\nvery broad ontogeny of cognitive patterning are less than convin-\ncing. Claims that spatial and kinship cognition are closely related\nuniversally evidently so far rest on slim foundations of some ana-\nlogous structuring. In English and other European languages\nthere is certainly to some extent a common language for these\ndomains, but it is not clear how widespread this is in cultures,\nor whether cognitive behaviour in the two domains can be\nshown to be parallel or sharing a common basis. Once again,\nhowever, this is a research area that offers enticing prospects.\nTypological variation of kinship terminologies\nis a function of strict ranking of constraints\non nested binary classification trees\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10002001\nPaul Miers\nEnglish Department, Towson University, Towson, MD 21252-0001.\nmiers@towson.edu\nhttps:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pdmiers\/\nAbstract: Jones argues that extending Seneca kin terms to second cousins\nrequires a revised version of Optimality Theoretic grammar. I extend\nSeneca terms using three constraints on expression of markers in\nnested binary classification trees. Multiple constraint rankings on a\nnested set coupled with local parity checking determines how a given\nkin classification grammar marks structural endogamy.\nJones deserves enormous credit for first applying OT grammar to\nkin classification nearly a decade ago (Jones 2003). His latest\nmodel, however, founders when he extends Seneca terms to\nsecond cousins because he tries to conjure lineal\/collateral\nand parallel\/cross distinctions from interactions among many\nconstraints. This strategy is surprising since he incorporated\nthose distinctions into his earlier model, and he cites Hage\n(2001), who used them in binary tree representations to\naccount for markedness relationships and diachronic change in\nterminologies.\nHere I describe an OT-based model that does properly assign\nSeneca G0 terms. This account illustrates what I think is at stake\nin Jones\u2019s attempt to bootstrap an underlying representation\n(UR) for kin space.\nMy model\u2019s UR is a nested set of asymmetric binary classification\ntrees (Fig. 1). Kin types are classes defined at terminal nodes for\neach generational tree, and second collaterals in a descending gen-\neration are partitioned by projections from collateral terminals\nin ascending generations. Left-to-right precedence is fixed\nrelative to the LIN0 Ego node by the nodal dominance hierarchy.\nInput to the grammar can be any chunk of this nested structure\nand output is the surjective mapping of the input onto itself that\nbest satisfies a strict ranking of one faithfulness and two markedness\nconstraints: MAX, which requires expression of each input marker\nin the output; NOCO, which bans collateral (CO) and side\nmarkers (C, F) in the output; and NOALIGN, which bans\nexpression of side and parity markers (\/\/, X) in the output.\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 395\nThere are four effective rankings of these constraints, each\nof which generates an optimal partitioning corresponding to one\nof the classification systems first proposed by Lowie (1928):\n(1)\nBifurcate collateral rankings mark both cross and parallel col-\nlateral classes; bifurcate merging rankings only mark cross collat-\neral classes and merge parallel collaterals with lineals; lineal\nrankings, indifferent to parity, merge all collaterals; generation\nrankings merge all collaterals with lineals.\nConstraint rankings, coupled with parity checking, cause\nMMBSS (mother\u2019s mother\u2019s brother\u2019s son\u2019s son) to merge with\nMBS in a Seneca cross collateral G0 output class (see Fig. 1).\nUR terminal markers define first collateral parity, but local rules\ndetermine which side marker is used to check the parity of\nsecond collaterals in descending generations. Seneca exhibits\n\u201cIroquois\u201d rather than \u201cDravidian\u201d parity in G\u00fe1 (Trautman &\nBarnes 1998): Parity for a descendent of any G\u00fe1 second collateral\nis determined by checking its sex against the G\u00fe1 side marker that\nmost immediately dominates its G\u00fe2 parent. G0 parity in both\nsystems is inherited from the G\u00fe1 parent. Since MMBS is cross\nin Seneca, MMBSS is also cross. \u201cDravidian\u201d parity for descen-\ndents of G\u00fe2 cross types is checked against the parent kin type\u2019s\ncontralateral side. In that case, MMBS is parallel, and the\nMMBSS G0 descendent type can\u2019t merge with MBS.\nConsistent with Hage\u2019s argument (Hage 2001), different rank-\nings can be applied in parallel to different generations. The\noptimal output tree for Seneca is:\n(2)\nThe G\u00fe2 ranking merges all collateral types with lineal types in the\nLIN\u00fe2 class. The G\u00fe1 ranking merges parallel first and second col-\nlateral types with the LIN\u00fe1 class and combines cross first and\nsecond collateral types into a superordinate X\u00fe1 class that\noccupies the position held by the neutralized CO\u00fe1 marker. The\nG0 ranking merges all child types of LIN\u00fe1 parallel types in a\nsingle LIN0 class and all child types of X\u00fe1 cross types into a\nsingle class defined by the projection of the X\u00fe1 marker onto G0.\nLexical coding trees for each generation are formed from (2).\nThe Seneca G0 tree is:\n(3)\nAn optimal output tree partitions classes only to the level of\nexpressed UR markers. Within-class partitionings, for example\nthe partitioning of the LIN0 class in (3), result from interaction\nbetween constraints on the lexicon and partial ordering of gener-\nations by the number of partitions in an optimal output tree.\nInteractions between parity checking and constraint rankings\nimpose these partial orders. If, for example, G0 parity were\nchecked against Ego\u2019s sex and G0 partitioning were determined\nonly by a ranking rather than by a ranking and the projected\nX\u00fe1 marker, the Seneca output tree (2) could have a different\npartial order. Terminological \u201cskewing\u201d (Lounsbury 1964) is a\nmechanism for subverting partial ordering. A lexical tree for\nthe Omaha terminology (Ackerman 1976) would be a composite\nnested structure that projects seven classes onto G0.\nJones uses many constraints to do all the classification work\nbecause he believes the logic of human kin classification stems\nfrom a domain independent OT \u201cgrammar faculty.\u201d My model\nsuggests a domain specific grammaticalization scenario in which a\ndedicated kin classification mechanism evolved to mark unilineal\ndescent in primate social organizations (Kapsalis 2004; Strier\n2004). The nested tree structure emerged as protohuman repro-\nductive coalitions required representations marking bilateral\nFigure 1 (Miers).

Constraint rankings do\nnot define marriage \u201crules\u201d but rather denominate kinds of related-\nness.

The observed distribution of kinship systems\nacross human societies suggests that some possibilities are preferred\nover others, a result that would indicate Jones\u2019 model needs to be\nrefined, especially in its treatment of markedness.\nThe Optimality Theory (OT) mechanism Jones proposes is a uni-\nversal account of the structure of kinship systems. Such OT\naccounts should relate to typology in two ways. First, they\nshould be able to predict the attested range of variation in a\ndomain using different rankings of a plausible (and, one hopes,\nrestricted) set of constraints. Second, the markedness constraints\nemployed should make predictions about the relative frequency\nof occurrence expected for the different patterns that can be\ngenerated. We explore here the quantitative distribution of kin\nsystems and suggest that it is emphatically nonrandom in a statisti-\ncally significant sense, and that at least some common patterns do\nnot necessarily support the markedness scales proposed by Jones.\nThe notion of an evaluation metric that could select one from\namongst a set of candidate grammars, so important for early\nwork in generative grammar (see, e.g., Chomsky 1965, pp. 34\u2013\n47; Chomsky & Halle 1968, ch. 9), has no relevance to the mech-\nanism of OT. This model uses input values taken from a set of uni-\nversal cognitive categories fed to a universal generative system to\nproduce candidate output forms. The candidate forms are evalu-\nated against a set of ranked constraints; again this is assumed to be\na universal set: \u201cThe ranking in a particular language is, in theory, a\ntotal ordering of a set of universal constraints.\u201d (McCarthy 2001,\np. 6) Different outputs result from varying the relative ranking\nof the constraints, but none of the resulting grammars is simpler\nor more economical than any other; the cognitive machinery is\nthe same in each case. The relatively small range of variation\nobserved in phonologies, the subfield of linguistics where OT ori-\nginated and has been most explored, is attributed to the fact that\nmarkedness constraints are grounded in facts about the articula-\ntion, perception, and processing of speech (Gordon 2007).\nAll other things being equal, Jones\u2019s analysis would predict that\nno kinship system would be more economical to generate than\nany other; however, Jones does propose some markedness con-\nstraints which should restrict the variation. It is therefore an\ninteresting question whether the observed distribution of differ-\nent kinship systems across the cultures and languages of the\nworld is random or not, and whether the distributional evidence\nsupports the proposed markedness constraints.\nWe take as a sample for analysis the kinship systems classified by\nMurdock (1970). This sample is accepted by Jones (2003) as the best\navailable source and provides up to 564 data points for eight subsys-\ntems of kinship. Given that this approaches being a sample of 10% of\nthe world\u2019s languages, we take it as adequate for an initial explora-\ntion of the question. The results of our investigation of the data\nare presented in Table 1. These results were obtained using an\nanalysis based on the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle,\ncomparing a multinomial distribution with all classes equi-probable\nversus a model with probabilities inferred by MML with a uniform\nprior (a \u00bc 1) (Wallace 2005, sect. 5.4.2, p. 248; Dowe 2008, fn. 151).\nBy using only these two rival models, we are being generous with\nour probabilities reported in Table 1.\nTable 1 shows that the probability of any of the patterns in the\nsubsystems of kinship analysed by Murdock occurring by chance\nis vanishingly small. Although in one case (Murdock\u2019s Table 8)\nthe probability is many orders of magnitude larger (undoubtedly\nlargely a result of the smaller sample in this case), that result still\nrepresents a minute possibility. Therefore the possible variation\nin kinship systems is constrained.\nIt is not possible to comment in all cases as to how these results\nrelate to Jones\u2019s markedness scales, but in the cases where a\ndirect relation can be made, the results are equivocal (see Table 2\nfor numerical data). For uncle and aunts (discussed in detail in\nJones 2003), two patterns are almost equally common. One treats\ncross-kin relations as marked, with father\u2019s brother and mother\u2019s\nsister collapsed with the parent terms, while the other pattern has\nspecial terms for both the parallel and the cross-relation. The first\npattern treats cross-kin relations as more marked than parallel\nrelations, in accord with Jones\u2019s markedness scale, but the second\npattern does not. In the case of siblings, the most common\npattern has four distinct terms coding both sex and seniority. In\nTable 1 (Musgrave & Dowe).

But it is not obvious that these data\nconfirm Jones\u2019 view that junior kin are marked relative to senior\nkin. For cross cousins, one of the two common patterns does not dis-\ntinguish this relation at all, while the other does. Again, only one\npossibility matches Jones\u2019s markedness scale. Overall, the match\nbetween Jones\u2019s markedness scales and these results is not strong.\nJones\u2019s analysis of kinship terminology using OT is promising\nwith respect to the first of the typological goals mentioned\nabove. His (2003) discussion shows that it generates the\ncommon possibilities in at least one subsystem. However, the\nsimple test reported here suggests that the analysis has some\nwork to do still to meet the second goal.\nThe applicability of theories of phonological\ncontrast to kinship systems\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10002402\nAndrew Nevins\nUniversity College London, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences,\nLondon WC1N 1PF, United Kingdom.\na.nevins@ucl.ac.uk\nAbstract: With the goal of broadening the range of possible extant\ntheories of phonological contrast from which kinship studies can draw,\nI outline, and briefly apply to the Seneca vs. English kinship systems,\nthree approaches developed for predicting universals and variations of\nvowel system contrast.\nJones\u2019 proposal, that kinship systems can be insightfully handled\nby recent linguistic framework of Optimality Theory (OT), is\nlaudable for modernizing the structuralist hypothesis of\nkinship-language homology. Both phonological and kinship\nsystems clearly share a number of formal properties (e.g., a\nfinite set of elements chosen from a larger contrast space; sym-\nmetric organization; differential treatment of marked categories),\nand kinship terms, being linguistic items, must arguably form\npart of any broad theory of language structure. Jones\u2019 effort\nfalls within the program of Cross-Modular Structural Parallelism\n(see, e.g., Anderson 1992; Nevins 2010), a hypothesis which seeks\nto minimize differences between levels or domains of linguistic\nstructure that are not specifically required from a difference in\nrepresentational \u201calphabet.\u201d In effect, both the organization of\na single existing system and a theory of universals and impossible\nsystems should use the same cognitive architecture, so vowels\nand kinship terms will exploit the same formal mechanisms of\ncontrast and neutralization while differing in the particular\nalphabet of representations, for example, referring to features\nsuch as [\u00fe\/-collateral] and [\u00fe\/-cross] rather than [\u00fe\/-rounded].\nWith the parallelism hypothesis in mind, the question becomes\nhow to deploy the same architecture in different cognitive\ndomains, and what that architecture specifically is. To this end,\nlet us consider three different approaches to paradigmatic con-\ntrast and markedness, drawn from morphology and phonology.\nIn doing so, I wish to make the main point that, despite its\nname, Optimality \u201cTheory\u201d is not in itself a specific theory of\nsuch relations or their constituent parts; it is a procedure for\nexpressing conflict among different formal constraints. As a\nresult, Jones\u2019 endorsement of OT as the right model from phonol-\nogy for representing kinship is arguably a choice at the wrong\nlevel, similar to saying that the best word-processor for typeset-\nting mathematical formulae is a battery-powered laptop. OT is\nmore like a hardware into which many particular constraint soft-\nware applications can be loaded.\nFor example, OT does not determine a phonological analysis\nof, say, Bulgarian unstressed vowel reduction: The \u201cheavy\nlifting\u201d of falsifiable predictions includes OT-independent\ndecisions such as whether stress is represented in terms of metri-\ncal feet or grids; whether mid-vowels form a natural class with\nhigh-vowels to the exclusion of low-vowels, and so forth.\nWhether to implement these analytical claims in a monostratal,\ndeclarative, and parallel model of processing versus a serialist\nand procedural architecture depends on the application to par-\nticular data structures. As Jones himself says, \u201cOT doesn\u2019t say\nwhat the rules of language are \u2013 rules differ among linguistic\ndomains \u2013 instead, it describes how rules interact\u201d (sect. 1).\nWith this in mind, recall the key phenomena Jones sets out to\ncapture in the article: (1) markedness relations between cat-\negories \u2013 the system of contrasts expressed in one language but\nnot another \u2013 and (2) a range of cross-linguistic variation. The\nexample of Seneca kinship as explored in the article shows\nthree differences from the English system:\n(A) A distinction between cross cousins and parallel cousins,\nand a syncretism of parents and their parallel siblings.\n(M \u00bc MZ=MB; F \u00bc FB= FZ, as opposed to English,\nwhere M=MZ \u00bc MB; F= FB \u00bc FZ).\n(B) An elder versus younger distinction in siblings (cf. English,\nwhere both are \u201cbrother\u201d).\n(C) Sibling\/parallel-cousin syncretism.\nWe turn to three frameworks developed for vowel systems\nand\/or inventories of inflectional contrasts and their application\nto Seneca versus English kinship:\n1. Dispersion Theory (e.g., Flemming 1995; see also Lindblom\n1986) views contrasts and inventories as the result of system-wide\npressures to minimize the number of categories crowding the\nvowel space, while maximizing certain important distinctions\nwhere possible. This is effectively Jones\u2019 approach to Seneca,\nFigure 1 (Nevins).

DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN .MINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLING\nTERMS;\nB. DISTINGUISH GRADE .MINIMIZE SIBLING TERMS;\nC. MINIMIZE COUSIN TERMS . DISTINGUISH DISTANCE.\n2. Hierarchical Contrast (e.g., Dresher 2009; see also Goode-\nnough 1967 for kinship) derives an inventory from a pre-existing\nset of binary or privative\/unary distinctions, through a successive\ndivision algorithm that halts when all terms constitute their\nown terminal nodes. In this approach, crosslinguistic variation\nemerges from the order in which features combine, or in which suc-\ncessive divisions are made. Seneca is captured as in the tree below.\n3. Feature-cooccurrence constraints start with universal bans on\nmarked categories and combinations that can be \u201cturned off\u201d in\ncertain languages (Calabrese 2005; Noyer 1997; see also Archangeli\n& Pulleyblank 1994, and see Greenberg 1966 for kinship). Marked-\nness is directly encoded in the definition of a feature. Crosslinguistic\nvariation results from the options to turn on\/off a universal set of\nneutralization rules. Assuming binary features in which the positive\nvalue represents the marked value, Seneca versus English results\nfrom certain features being \u201cdisallowed\u201d:\nSeneca: neutralize [\u00fecollateral] with [-collateral] throughout\nEnglish: neutralize [\u00fecross] with [-cross] throughout\nEnglish: neutralize [\u00feelder] with [-elder] throughout\nMuch work in phonology and morphology is devoted to comparing\ntheories in terms of predictions for typology of possible languages,\norder of the acquisition of elements, and diachronic changes. These\napproaches differ in the data structures assumed and the correspond-\ning discovery procedures for contrast. For example, Dispersion\nTheory assumes no componential features (and thus has less commit-\nment to representational structure); Hierarchical contrast highlights\nthe relations of contrast versus noncontrast in categories, rather\nthan markedness; Feature-cooccurrence invokes no ranking pro-\ncedure, unlike the other two. Deciding among such theories\napplied to kinship includes evaluating their success in expressing\nimpossible syncretisms (e.g., F \u00bcMB= FB), as well as necessary\nimplicational relations (e.g., a gender contrast among cousins\nimplies one among siblings, but not vice versa). The choice among\nthese frameworks is largely independent from implementation\nwithin an OT or other architecture. Just as OpenOffice is the same\nsoftware when running on a laptop or a desktop, the theories dis-\ncussed above can be plugged into OT or into a serial and derivational\nframework. Enthusiasm for OT does not inextricably commit one to a\nDispersion approach to contrast, and nor, importantly, vice versa.\nFurther dialogue and research in the area of applying theories\nof contrast and markedness to kinship, therefore, can disentangle\nwhich predictive components are attributable to architectural\nprinciples, such as a system of ranked violable constraints and\nwhich are attributable to specific analytic components, such as\nsystemic tension between minimizing terms and maximizing\ncertain distinctions, or the choices involving the particular set\nof distinctive features defining the \u201calphabet\u201d of kinship terms.\nThe algebraic logic of kinship terminology\nstructures\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001378\nDwight W.

This,\nhowever, ignores the fact that these definitions can be predicted from\nthe computational, algebralike structural logic of kinship terminologies,\nas has been discussed and demonstrated in numerous publications. The\nrichness of human kinship systems derives from the cultural knowledge\nembedded in kinship terminologies as symbolic computation systems,\nnot the post hoc constraints devised by Jones.\nHuman kinship involves what it means to be kin, to act like kin,\nand how we are kin in a mutually understood manner through\nkinship relations. Kinship relations can be expressed either gen-\nealogically, by recursively tracing from one individual to another\n(Bennardo & Read 2007; Leaf & Read 2010; Read 2001; 2010;\nsubmitted) using parent, child and spouse relations, or by kin\nterms that identify categories of genealogical relations: \u201cif there\nis any universal here . . . all speech communities use both cat-\negory and genealogy . . . in explaining kinship to themselves and\nto others\u201d (Parkin 2009, p. 165). That is, we should view \u201cthe\ngenealogical and the terminological spaces as co-existing concep-\ntual structures with overlap arising through application of the\nsymbols from these two conceptual structures to the same\ndomain of persons.\u201d (Read 2001, p. 80; contra Jones\u2019s misrepre-\nsentation in sect. 5.2).\nBut why two systems, and what is the relationship between the\ntwo systems? Jones does not address the first question and wants\nto answer the second by mapping genealogical relations to kin\nterms with OT rules. To see the problem, start with the usual\nanswer to the first question, namely that categorization makes\nthe combinatorial explosion produced through genealogical\ntracing cognitively manageable.\nThe categories, as we will now show, are determined through\ncomputing kin relations directly and without reference to geneal-\nogy using a kin term product for a pair of kin terms, K and L,\ndefined as the kin term, M, that Ego would (properly) use for\nalter2 when Ego (properly) refers to alter1 by the kin term L\nand alter1 (properly) refers to alter2 by the kin term K (Read\n1984; 2001; 2007 among others). For English speakers, the kin\nterm product of daughter and uncle is cousin, for if you (Ego)\nrefer to a man (alter1) as uncle and that man refers to a girl\n(alter2) as daughter, then you know to refer to that girl as\ncousin from knowledge of your kinship terminology even\nwithout knowing the genealogical relations involved.\nThat people in all societies compute kin relations through\nkin terms products is well documented through numerous\nethnographic examples quoted in Read (2001; 2007). For\nexample:\n\u201cKinship reckoning on Rossel [New Guinea] does not rely on knowl-\nedge of kin-type strings. . .. What is essential in order to apply a kin\nterm to an individual X, is to know how someone else, of a determinate\nkinship type to oneself, refers to X. From that knowledge alone, a\ncorrect appellation can be deduced. For example, suppose someone\nI call a t\u0131\u02c6de\u02c6 \u2018sister\u2019 calls X a tp:ee \u2018my child\u2019, then I can call X a che\u02c6ne\u02c6\n\u2018my nephew\u2019, without having the faintest idea of my genealogical con-\nnection to X\u201d (Levinson 2006, p. 18; emphasis added).\nThis computational knowledge embedded in a kinship termi-\nnology can be made explicit through systematic elicitation of\nkin terms using kin term products with the kin terms for the\ncore, structural positions in a family (Leaf 2006; Leaf & Read\n2010) and displaying the structural relations among the elicited\nterms through a kin term map (see Fig. 1). The form of the\nmap is terminology specific. From this map we can calculate\nkin term products without reference to genealogy; for example,\nthe kin term product, nephew of grandmother, yields first\ncousin once removed since one goes from self to nephew in\nthe map by the kin term product, child of child of parent, and\nthat product takes us from grandmother to first cousin once\nremoved.\nWe now construct (hence predict) the genealogical definitions\nof the English kin terms from the kin term map. First map the\nprimary kin terms to their corresponding genealogical categories:\nmother ! fmg, father ! ffg, son ! fsg and daughter ! fdg.\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 399\nThen express any kin term as a product of primary kin terms and\ncompute the set product for the corresponding genealogical cat-\negories to determine the predicted category of genealogical\nrelations for that kin term. For example, from the kin term\nmap, uncle \u00bc son of grandmother\u00fe son of grandfather\u00fe\nhusband of daughter of grandmother\u00fe husband of daughter of\ngrandfather, so uncle ! fmm, fmgfsg < fff, fmgfsg < fmm,\nmfgfdgfhg < fff, fmgfdgfhg \u00bc fmms, fms, ffs, fms, mmdh, mfdh,\nffdh, fmdhg \u00bc fmb, fb, mzh, fzhg, where < is set union, b is\nthe genealogical relation brother, z is the genealogical relation\nsister, h is the affinal relation husband, and genealogical strings\nare written in the reverse order from kin term products. Using\nthis procedure, we obtain 100% agreement between predicted\nand actual genealogical definitions of kin terms (see Fig. 2).\nThis accounts for the genealogical definitions of kin terms upon\nwhich the OT rules are based. The rules, then, are just describing\nFigure 1 (Read). Kin term map for the American kinship terminology based on kin term products with the primary kin terms parent,\nchild and spouse. An arrow indicates the result of taking the kin term product of the kin term at the base of the arrow with the primary\nkin term represented by that arrow.

Terminology structures begin\nwith a core structure of ascending kin terms generated using\neither (1) a parent kin term as a generating term (this accounts\nfor the properties of descriptive kinship terminologies such as\nthe American\/English terminology) or (2) a parent kin term and\na sibling kin term as generating terms (this accounts for the prop-\nerties of classificatory terminologies such as the Seneca terminol-\nogy discussed by Jones), then expand the structure with a\nstructure of descending kin terms isomorphic to the ascending\nstructure (along with structural equations that define reciprocity\nbetween ascending and descending generating kin terms), then\nintroduce sex marking of kin terms, and lastly generate affinal\nterms through a spouse, generating the term. The kinship termi-\nnology generated in this manner has the form of an algebraic struc-\nture, hence the use of algebraic formalism to express the\nunderlying generative logic. The grammar of a kinship terminology\nlies in this generative account (see Read 2001, table 2; Bennardo &\nRead 2007, Fig. 1), not the OT rules as they only address the con-\nsequences of the generative logic of a terminology.\nLastly, the rules posited by Jones violate the required univers-\nality of constraints: \u201cOptimality theory hypothesizes that the set\nof well-formedness constraints is universal: not just universally\navailable to be chosen from, but literally present in every\nlanguage\u201d (Prince & Smolensky 1997, p. 1605; emphasis\nadded). Jones uses terminology specific constraints (see\nespecially Note 1) and achieves the appearance of universality\nonly through low ranking of constraints irrelevant to a terminol-\nogy. Consider the terminology of the !Kung San, a hunter-gath-\nerer group in the northwestern part of Botswana among whom\nI did fieldwork. Their kin term usage depends on a name giver-\nname receiver relationship established when a newborn is\nnamed for a close relative (Marshall 1976). A constraint based\non the name giver\u2013name receiver relationship would not be uni-\nversal and placing it low in the ranking for other terminologies\ndoes not make it universal. Without universality, OT rules\nreduce to description and hence have unclear connection, if\nany, to cognitive processes.\nGenealogy (and the relationship between\nopposite-sex\/same-sex sibling pairs) is what\nkinship is all about\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10002025\nCarles Salazar\nDepartment of Art and Social History (Anthropology Program), University of\nLleida, 25003 Lleida, Catalonia, Spain.\nsalazar@hahs.udl.cat\nwww.hahs.udl.es\/hs\/csalazar.htm\nAbstract: What are the theoretical implications of a universal genealogy?\nAfter the demise of relativism in kinship studies, there is much to be\ngained by joining old formal-structural analysis of kinship to recent\ncognitive-evolutionary approaches. This commentary shows how the\nlogic of kinship terminologies, specifically those of the Seneca-Iroquois,\ncan be clarified by looking at the relationship between opposite-sex\/\nsame-sex sibling pairs.\nThe target article is a sound, original and well-argued examin-\nation of one of the most fundamental topics in the history of\nanthropological kinship theory. Among its numerous merits,\nI would single out the much-needed connection the target article\nestablishes between traditional formal and structural analyses, the\ncognitive anthropology of the 1960s, and more recent cognitive-\nevolutionary perspectives on the human mind and behavior in\ngeneral. Many post-Schneiderian kinship studies are characterized\nby a relativist and social-constructivist perspective. By contrast, the\ntarget article clearly posits genealogy as the key constituent of any\nkinship system \u2013 not in terms of a substance (biogenetic connec-\ntions) but as a structure, a system of relations (see Salazar 2009).\nArguably, though the relationship between the substance of geneal-\nogy, human biological reproduction, and its structure is not contin-\ngent, the latter can be systematically analyzed independently of the\nformer (cf. Read 2001). That is the reason kinship terms, as Jones\ncorrectly points out, may not have genealogical definitions despite\nbeing genealogically structured. I will focus my comment on what I\nbelieve is perhaps a rather specific but serious limitation in the way\nin which Jones\u2019 use of Optimality Theory (OT) deals with the\nSeneca-Iroquois terminologies.\nThe ranking of constraints, which appears to be one of the main\ncharacteristics of this theory, allows for greater flexibility in the\nidentification of the distinctive features of kinship terms than the\nmore conventional componential and reductionist\/extensionist\napproaches. But what I see as problematic is the faithfulness con-\nstraint of \u201cdistinguish matrikin,\u201d which the author places in the\nsecond position in the ranking order. This gives rise to a number\nof complications; for example, if matrikin need to be distinguished,\nhow can we explain that the Father\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son, who does not\nbelong to Ego\u2019s matrilineage, is classed as a \u201cbrother\u201d together with\nmatrilineal relatives such as Mother\u2019s Sister\u2019s Son? Although Iro-\nquois terminologies have normally been associated with matrilineal\nsocieties (despite numerous exceptions including the Yanomamo,\nAlgonquins, Dakota, and Dogon), Lounsbury\u2019s (1964) reanalysis\nof Morgan\u2019s seminal work (1871) seems to eliminate the possibility\nof any significant connection between Iroquois equations and\n(matrilineal) descent. Stated otherwise, the bifurcate merging\ncharacteristic of Iroquois terminologies (merging of Father with\nFather\u2019s Brother and Mother with Mother\u2019s Sister) is not con-\nnected to the need to single out matrilineally related relatives.\nThus I simply fail to see in what way the \u201cdistinguish matrikin\u201d con-\nstraint makes any improvement on the more traditional cross\/par-\nallel distinction. Admittedly, as other authors have pointed out\n(Allen 1998; He\u00b4ritier 1981: annex 1), a cross\/parallel concept\nthat can be applied equally to relatives of all three central gener-\nations \u2013 G0 (Ego\u2019s generation), G\u00fe1 (Ego\u2019s parents) and G21\n(Ego\u2019s children) \u2013 has not yet been formulated. I think this may\nbe the case, as Jones also intimates, because this distinction\nderives from a more fundamental one. Contrary to Jones\u2019s argu-\nment, however, this has nothing to do with descent but with\nwhat I take to be, following He\u00b4ritier (1996, pp. 62\u201367), the basic\nbinary opposition observable in all kinship terminological\nsystems: that between same-sex and opposite-sex sibling pairs, in\nvirtue of which opposite-sex siblings are never seen as \u201ccloser\u201d\nthan same-sex siblings. He\u00b4ritier contends, correctly in my view,\nthat this fundamental law of kinship originates in the differential\nvalue of the sexes as is culturally recognized in all known societies.\nThe four main terminological systems \u2013 birfurcate merging (Iro-\nquois and Dravidian, plus Crow-Omaha systems), bifurcate collat-\neral (Latin, Sudanese), lineal (our system) and generational\n(Hawaiian) \u2013 can be all seen as specific developments of the\nsame-sex\/opposite-sex sibling relationship. And even the so-\ncalled \u201cfifth possibility,\u201d a theoretically possible but sociologically\nnonexistent terminological system (Hage 1997; He\u00b4ritier 1981, ch.\n1), is a direct result of the infringement of that fundamental law\nof kinship.\nIt would take me far beyond the scope of the present commen-\ntary to elaborate on all the implications of this elementary rule for\neach terminological system. Here I will focus on the Seneca-Iro-\nquois system, which Jones analyzes as an instance of the workings\nof OT. In the Iroquois system, children of same-sex siblings (par-\nallel cousins) call each other brother and sister, while children of\nopposite-sex siblings (cross cousins), are classed simply as cousins.\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 401\nBy the same token, children of same-sex (cross) cousins will call\neach other brother and sister while those of opposite-sex\ncousins will call each other cousins. In keeping with these\nsimple rules, which clearly derive from the principle according\nto which same-sex siblings should be seen as closer than oppo-\nsite-sex siblings, same-sex siblings are \u201cmerged\u201d and become\nthe parents of all their children, while opposite-sex siblings are\nkept separate, becoming \u201cuncles\u201d and \u201caunts\u201d of each other\u2019s chil-\ndren. These rules also account for the fact that the Father\u2019s Broth-\ner\u2019s Son is classed as a \u201cbrother\u201d regardless of the matrilineage he\nhappens to belong to, and explain why the Older Mother\u2019s Broth-\ner\u2019s Son\u2019s Son is a \u201ccousin\u201d and not a \u201cbrother.\u201d Both this individ-\nual and Ego are children of opposite-sex cousins: Ego\u2019s older\nmother and her mother\u2019s brother\u2019s son. The simplicity of this prin-\nciple contrasts with Jones\u2019 argument here, which is unnecessarily\nconvoluted. No further rules, principles or constraints are needed\nto generate all kin terms of the Iroquois system.\nDespite this problem in Jones\u2019 argument, his concern with dis-\nclosing \u201cfundamental structures of the human mind\u201d through\nkinship analysis is highly laudable. Further research along\nthese lines will certainly contribute to enhancing anthropology\u2019s\nposition among the human sciences by deepening our under-\nstanding of the oldest, most universal and most elementary\nform of human relationship.\nThe shared evolutionary history of kinship\nclassifications and language\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001421\nRobert M.

One system\nmaps onto the other, suggesting that during human evolution kinship\nclassifications and language shared a common cognitive precursor.\nJones argues that kinship and language are similar in their dis-\ncrete, combinatorial structure, and that these similarities point\ntoward \u201cgeneral principles of cognition or communication.\u201d\nAlthough he does not discuss evolution explicitly, he suggests\nthat the shared mechanisms underlying kinship classifications\nand language may have evolved from the same cognitive precur-\nsor. Recent studies of nonhuman primates support this hypoth-\nesis. Specifically, they demonstrate that both the recognition\nand classification of individuals and the recognition and classifi-\ncation of vocalizations constitute discrete combinatorial systems\nthat interact closely. One system maps onto the other, suggesting\nthat they share underlying cognitive mechanisms. The close link\nbetween recognition and classification of individuals and vocali-\nzations supports the view that, during human evolution, the cog-\nnitive mechanisms underlying kinship classifications and those\nunderlying language shared a common precursor.\nAlthough the physical features and vocalizations of different\nanimals vary continuously, free-ranging monkeys and apes recog-\nnize each other as individuals, both by appearance and by voice.\nThis in itself constitutes a very simple, discretely coded system of\nknowledge that is probably pervasive among group-living animals.\nMoreover, from this relatively simple starting point, monkeys,\napes, and perhaps many other species make further, more elaborate\nclassifications of individuals. Many monkeys, for example, recog-\nnize other animals\u2019 dominance ranks. They also distinguish pairs\nof individuals who have close behavioral associations from those\nwhose interactions are less frequent and predictable (reviewed in\nCheney & Seyfarth 2007). In monkeys, close bonds typically mani-\nfest in frequent grooming, support in aggressive coalitions, toler-\nance at feeding sites, and other behaviors. They may persist for\nmany years. In baboons and macaques, for example, males disperse\nbut females remain in their natal group throughout their lives, and\nclose behavioral associations are most common among matrilineal\nkin \u2013 mothers, daughters, and sisters \u2013 who almost always form\nsuch bonds; but strong bonds may also occur among less closely\nrelated females, particularly when these individuals have no close\nkin present in the group (Schino 2001; Silk et al. 2006; 2010). In\nchimpanzees, females disperse but males remain in their natal\ngroup throughout their lives, and close bonds are formed\nbetween males and, more rarely, between females. Such bonds\nmanifest in grooming, coalitions, meat sharing, and participation\nin hunts (Langergraber et al. 2009; Mitani 2006; Muller &\nMitani 2005; Nishida 1983; Watts 1998; Wittig 2010; Wittig &\nBoesch 2003).\nIn baboons, experiments suggest that individuals not only recog-\nnize other animals\u2019 dominance ranks and kin relations but also\ncombine this information to create a representation of social\nrelations in which ranked individuals are grouped into families\n(Bergman et al. 2003; Seyfarth et al. 2005; see also Penn et al.\n2008). Observational data on Japanese macaques yield similar\nresults (Schino et al. 2006). The classification of individuals on\nthe simultaneous basis of kinship and rank constitutes a conceptual\nstructure in primates because, while the individual elements may\nchange over time as animals are born, die, join or leave the\ngroup, the overall structure remains constant. Moreover, animals\ntreat one another differently not just because of their own behavior,\nbut also because of their membership in a particular kin group. For\nexample, from the moment of its birth, baboons treat an infant that\nbelongs to a high-ranking matriline differently from the way they\ntreat an infant that belongs to a low-ranking matriline. This differ-\nence in behavior arises not because infants behave differently but\nbecause they belong to different kin groups. In this respect, nonhu-\nman primates\u2019 recognition of kinship and rank can be thought of as a\nconventionalized system, based on discrete elements \u2013 individual\nidentity, kinship, and rank \u2013 combined in a rule-governed\nmanner (Cheney & Seyfarth 2007).\nNonhuman primate vocalizations also constitute a very simple,\ndiscrete, combinatorial system of recognition and classification.\nMost calls are individually distinctive, and individual recognition\nby voice is common. Many call types are also used only in\nparticular circumstances (reviewed in Seyfarth & Cheney\n2010). Baboons, for example, give acoustically different alarm\ncalls only to particular predators, territorial calls only during\nencounters with other groups, screams only by lower-ranking\nto higher-ranking individuals, threat vocalizations only by\nhigher-ranking individuals to lower-ranking individuals, and so\non. Listeners, moreover, recognize these predictable relations.\nIn the playback experiments cited above, where A was dominant\nto B, listeners showed little response to playback of the sequence\n\u201cA threatens B and B screams\u201d but responded strongly to the\nsequence \u201cB threatens A and A screams\u201d (Bergman et al.\n2003). In sum, just as nonhuman primates recognize individuals\nand classify them according to rank and matrilineal kinship, the\nsame animals recognize and classify vocalizations according to\ncaller identity, context, and the \u201crules\u201d of call delivery.\nJones notes that in humans, we sometimes view kinship and\nlanguage as separate cognitive domains. By contrast, among non-\nhuman primates the recognition of individuals, kin groups, and\nrank relations (on the one hand) and the meaning of vocalizations\n(on the other) are inextricably bound together. Both are discrete,\ncombinatorial systems, and each influences the other. When\nyoung animals learn to recognize their matrilineal kin, they do\nso in part by learning to recognize these animals\u2019 vocalizations;\nconversely, a caller\u2019s identity, rank, and kin group membership\nhelp to determine the meaning of a call or a sequence of calls to\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n402 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\na listener. When a baboon hears Sylvia giving threatening\nvocalizations to Hannah and Hannah screaming, the listener\u2019s\ninterpretation of this sequence draws not only on her identifi-\ncation of the call types and the contexts in which they are given\nbut also on her recognition of the callers, their ranks, and their\nmatrilineal kin groups. In this respect, the cognitive processes\ninvolved in the recognition and classification of individuals\noverlap significantly with the cognitive processes involved in the\nrecognition of call meaning. Such data offer indirect support for\nthe hypothesis that, during the course of human evolution, the\ncognitive mechanisms underlying kinship classifications and\nthose underlying language evolved from a common source.\nLexical universals of kinship and social\ncognition\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X10001433\nAnna Wierzbicka\nSchool of Language Studies, The Australian National University, Canberra\nACT 0200 Australia.\nanna.wierzbicka@anu.edu.au\nwww.une.edu.au\/bcss\/linguistics\/nsm\/\nAbstract: Jones recognizes the existence of \u201cprimitives of conceptual\nstructures,\u201d out of which \u201clocal representations of kinship are\nconstructed.\u201d NSM semantics has identified these primitives through a\ncross-linguistic search for lexical universals (\u201cNSM\u201d stands for Natural\nSemantic Metalanguage and also for the corresponding linguistic\ntheory). These empirical universals provide, I argue, a better bridge\nbetween cognitive anthropology and evolutionary psychology than the\nabstract constructs of OT, with dubious claim to conceptual reality.\nA decade ago anthropologist Raymond Fogelson (2001, p. 41)\nwrote: \u201cThe study of kinship, which played such a prominent\nrole in the development of anthropological theory, now seems\nto be a dead topic. . .. Only time will tell whether the subject\nwill be revived, reincarnated, or reinvented. . ..\u201d (See also Sousa\n2003 on \u201cThe fall of kinship\u201d).\nIt is to Jones\u2019 great credit that he is trying to revive this subject,\nwhich is central to the understanding of social life and social cogni-\ntion. I also appreciate Jones\u2019 defence of the inherent link between\n\u201ckinship\u201d and \u201cgenealogy\u201d (or \u201creproduction\u201d) and his recognition\nof the existence of \u201cprimitives of conceptual structure,\u201d out of\nwhich \u201clocal representations of kinship\u201d are constructed (Fig. 1 of\nthe target article).\nOn the other hand, I see as a weakness of Jones\u2019 account its\ndependence on a particular formal theory (OT) and its lack of atten-\ntion to the question of metalanguage. The \u201cconstraints\u201d approach\ndepends on metaterms like \u201cmatrikin,\u201d \u201cgeneration,\u201d \u201csex,\u201d and\n\u201ccousin,\u201d which don\u2019t have equivalents in the languages of the\npeople concerned and so have dubious claim to conceptual reality.\nAs I see it, the fundamental facts are that all languages have\nwords for \u201cmother\u201d and \u201cfather\u201d, and in all probability \u201cwife\u201d\nand \u201chusband\u201d, and that in all languages kinship systems are\nbuilt on the bedrock of these four concepts. This fact is often\nobscured by the polysemy of the words in question (Wierzbicka\n1992; Shapiro 2008), but Jones acknowledged it in earlier work\n(Jones 2004). In the target article, however, the focus is so\nmuch on theory that the empirically established lexical universals\nof kinship seem to disappear from view.\nJones\u2019 approach to kinship, which is wedded to OT, is vulner-\nable to the criticism that D\u2019Andrade (1995, p. 30) directed at\ncomponential analysis of kinship as it was practised in the 1960s:\n\u201cThis type of analysis seems specialized, arcane, and formalistic.\u201d\nThe charge of ethnocentrism aimed at traditional anthropological\nanalyses of kinship by, for example, Wallace and Atkins (1969,\np. 364) applies as well. More recently, Leaf (2006, p. 306)\nnoted: \u201cThe kin types were symbolized by one or two letters so\nas to seem abstract and schematic, but in the end the ideas they\nrepresented were only those of the American kinship system, M\nor Mo for Mother, F or Fa for Father. . .B for Brother, Si or Z\nfor sister. . .sometimes with added qualifiers for age and the like.\u201d\nJones doesn\u2019t use symbols like M, F, B and S, but in his com-\nparison of English and Seneca he, too, relies on kin types taken\nfrom English, such as parent, sibling, child and cousin \u2013 con-\ncepts for which there are no words in Seneca itself. Analysing\nSeneca kinship terminology through such terms means, I think,\nimposing on it a perspective alien to it.\nFor my part, I contend that an adequate, non-Anglocentric fra-\nmework for the comparison of kinship systems can be based on\nempirically discovered lexical and conceptual universals, begin-\nning with \u201cmother,\u201d \u201cfather,\u201d \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife.\u201d In addition,\nsuch a culture-neutral analytical framework can build on the set\nof empirically discovered \u201csemantic primes,\u201d like \u201cpeople,\u201d \u201cdo,\u201d\n\u201chappen,\u201d \u201cbody,\u201d \u201cbefore,\u201d and 60 or so others, which, evidence\nsuggests, can be found as words, or distinct word meanings, in all\nlanguages. (See Table 1.)\nAccording to the findings of NSM-based investigations\n(Goddard 2008; Goddard & Wierzbicka 2002; Wierzbicka\n1996; 2006; 2010 and many other references listed under the\nbibliographical links at http:\/\/www.une.edu.au\/bcss\/linguistics\/\nnsm\/), there are two sets of universal concepts: a few dozen in-\ndefinable semantic primes (\u201catoms of meaning\u201d), and a smaller\nset of \u201csemantic molecules\u201d \u2013 concepts that are complex and\ncan be defined in terms of primes but which function as units\nin the construction of culturally variable compound ideas. (In\naddition, there are many molecules that are language-specific.)\nThe four lexical pivots of kinship \u2013 \u201cmother,\u201d \u201cfather,\u201d \u201cwife\u201d\nand \u201chusband\u201d \u2013 belong to the second set (Wierzbicka, forth-\ncoming). Other semantic molecules which, evidence suggests,\nare universal and which are highly relevant to kinship, are the\nthree mainstays of social cognition: \u201cmen,\u201d \u201cwomen,\u201d and \u201cchil-\ndren\u201d (Goddard 2010; Goddard & Wierzbicka, forthcoming).\nConcepts lexicalised in all languages allow us to bring hypoth-\nesized conceptual structures into the orbit of recognizable\nhuman ways of speaking; they give us an empirically grounded\nanalytical framework that overcomes both the \u201ctechnicism\u201d of\nkinship algebras, old and new, and the Anglocentrism of descrip-\ntions based on language-particular English kin types.\nJones proposes rules and constraints that may make sense from\nthe point of view of OT theorists but which are anything but\n\u201cexperience-near\u201d or psychologically real. How such rules\ncould be learned by ordinary speakers, and how they can be ver-\nified by researchers, is far from clear. It is also far from clear how\nformalization in terms of OT can provide a window onto \u201chow\npeople think about kinship\u201d (as envisaged in Jones 2004, p. 211).\nIn the end, one can\u2019t help feeling that the old key questions of\n\u201cpsychological reality\u201d (Burling 1967), \u201cthe native\u2019s point of view\u201d\n(Geertz 1976), and \u201cthe insider\u2019s understanding\u201d (Shore 1996)\nhave vanished from view in the target article, amid concerns\nabout \u201cfaithfulness constraints,\u201d \u201cscales limiting allowed permu-\ntations in constraint ranking,\u201d \u201cmarkedness scales,\u201d and other\nsimilarly abstract and theory-dependent analytical constructs.\nAs Kronenfeld (2001, p. 158) notes: \u201cThe formal analysis that\nbest represents the regularities of the terminology may not\nnecessarily be best at representing the cognitive operations by\nwhich native speakers navigate the system.\u201d\nThe \u201cseven faithfulness constraints\u201d Jones proposes depend on\nEnglish concepts such as \u201cparent\u201d and \u201csibling,\u201d \u201csex,\u201d \u201cgener-\nation\u201d and \u201cage,\u201d which have no equivalents in most languages\nof the world. By contrast, the seven building-blocks of kinship\nand social cognition recognized in the NSM theory \u2013 \u201cmother,\u201d\n\u201cfather,\u201d \u201cwife,\u201d \u201chusband,\u201d \u201cmen,\u201d \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d \u2013\nare, evidence suggests, lexical universals, experience-near and\nempirically verifiable. If in our portrayal of local systems of\nkinship we rely on such universals (as it is done in NSM-based\nanalyses), we can capture generalizations about the structure of\nsuch systems by recognizing recurrent semantic components\nCommentary\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 403\nand recurrent kin name extensions both with and across languages\nand cultures. Why not start building bridges between cognitive\nanthropology and evolutionary psychology on these empirical,\nculture-neutral, and theory-independent human universals?\nAuthor\u2019s Response\nThinking about kinship and thinking\ndoi:10.1017\/S0140525X1000275X\nDoug Jones\nDepartment of Anthropology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.\ndouglas.jones@anthro.utah.edu\nAbstract: The target article proposes a theory uniting the\nanthropological study of kin terminology with recent\ndevelopments in linguistics and cognitive science. The response\nto comments reaches two broad conclusions. First, the theory\nmay be relevant to several current areas of research, including (a)\nthe nature and scope of the regular, \u201cgrammatical\u201d side of\nlanguage, (b) the organization of different domains of conceptual\nstructure, including parallels across domains, their taxonomic\ndistribution and implications for evolution, and (c) the influence\nof conceptual structure on social structure. Second, the theory\ncompares favorably with alternatives, including (a) the theory that\nkin terminology is not really that complicated, (b) the theory that\nkin terms mirror social categories, (c) componential analysis, and\n(d) kinship algebra. If further research in anthropology,\nlinguistics, and other fields supports the theory, and confirms the\npsychological reality of proposed mechanisms, then kinship may\nemerge as a model system for the study of important issues in\ncognition and social organization.\nThe target article sets forth a theory \u2013 call it the Concep-\ntual Structure and Grammar (CS&G) theory \u2013 of kin ter-\nminology. In presenting the theory, I find myself in the\nposition of a matchmaker, trying to broker a marriage\nsettlement between the anthropology of kinship and\ncurrent work in linguistics and cognitive science. In\nresponding to commentators\u2019 appraisals of the proposed\nmatch, I first say more about how the two sides might\nlive together, then take up objections to the match from\nsupporters of rival theories of kin terminology, and\nfinally say something about the theory\u2019s prospects.\nThe first section of the response is concerned with how\nthe CS&G theory situates the study of kin terms and\nkinship rules within several current research programs in\nthe cognitive sciences. This section addresses comments\nabout the relationship of kinship grammar to grammar\nmore generally, as understood within the framework of\nOptimality Theory. It also discusses comments relating the\nconceptual structure of kinship to other domains of concep-\ntual structure, especially the structure of physical space, and\nrelating human and nonhuman conceptual structure.\nFinally, this section takes up a topic raised by a number of\ncommentators, the relationship of kin categorization to\nkinship and social organization more broadly, positioning\nthe current theory within a larger program of investigating\nhow conceptual structure affects social structure. According\nto Levinson, \u201cThe neglect of kinship in current anthropol-\nogy and in the cognitive sciences is not far short of a\nscandal\u201d: In this section I try to show that the cognitive\nsciences have much to gain from ending this neglect.\nThe second section responds to criticisms and claims\nfrom defenders of alternative approaches. Some commen-\ntators argue that the present theory is too complicated and\ncould be replaced by a simpler, more intuitive approach.\nOthers favor sociocultural rather than cognitive-linguistic\naccounts of kin categorization. And others advocate\nalternative formal theories: componential analysis and\nkinship algebra. This section addresses these comments,\nwhile expanding on the treatment of Seneca terminology\npresented in the target article, and bringing in other ter-\nminologies. Throughout, I try to show that specific criti-\ncisms of the CS&G theory don\u2019t hold up, and that the\ntheory has advantages over the alternatives.\nTable 1 (Wierzbicka).

Conceptual structure and grammar,\nmeet kinship\nA number of commentators respond to a major thesis of\nthe target article: that kinship, and kin terminology specifi-\ncally, is tightly structured, even \u201cgrammatical,\u201d and the\nstudy of kinship has multiple connections with ongoing\nresearch programs in linguistics and other highly struc-\ntured domains of cognition and interaction. Some of\nthese connections are reviewed below.\nR1.1. Kinship grammar as grammar\nThe present theory may have implications for the nature\nand scope of grammar. The distinction between\ngrammar \u2013 the rule-governed, generative part of\nlanguage \u2013 and the lexicon \u2013 the arbitrary, memorized\npart \u2013 is commonly equated with the distinction\nbetween syntax and words-plus-morphemes. (Leaf, for\nexample, seems to equate these as a matter of definition.)\nBut even if we somehow ignore phonological grammar,\nthese two distinctions don\u2019t really line up very well.\nMany items in the lexicon are bigger than words, including\nidioms like \u201ckick the bucket,\u201d and syntactically anomalous\nconstructions like \u201cthe ___ [comparative phrase], the ___\n[comparative phrase]\u201d (e.g., \u201cthe more, the merrier\u201d; Jack-\nendoff 2002, pp. 167\u201382).\nConversely, the evidence from kin terminology implies\nthat, in some semantic fields, words behave like pieces of\ngrammar. More precisely, kin terminologies (the way kin\ntypes are split and merged), rather than kin terms (the\nactual words used for kin), are grammatically structured.\nLike the inflections of frequently used regular verbs, kin\nterm meanings may be memorized but are apparently\nalso subject to an OT-style process of evaluation often\nenough to keep them grammatical.Hogeweg, Legendre,\n& Smolensky (Hogeweg et al.) present their own version\nof the distinction between kin terminology and kin terms.\nThey also clarify the difference between (1) theories of\nhow the contribution of words to meaning varies with\ncontext, and (2) the present theory of how the context-\nindependent meanings of kin categories are structured.\nThe CS&G theory is just one example of the very wide\nrange of application of OT. In his comment, Biro\u00b4 asks,\n\u201cWill Optimality Theory colonize all of higher cognition?\u201d\nThe target article suggests an answer: OT-style grammar\ncan colonize only \u201cgrammar-friendly\u201d domains of\nlanguage, domains that support a successful process of\nconstraint discovery. In constraint discovery, language\nlearners explore their motor, perceptual, and conceptual\ncapacities to discover universal prototypical and distinctive\nfeatures. Since others in the community are doing the\nsame, learners can count on constraints being mutually\nknown and can move on to using linguistic evidence to\ndetermine how constraints are ranked. Different linguistic\nenvironments may differ in how thoroughly they encou-\nrage learners to explore different regions of constraint\nspace, but in any region they explore, learners are\nexpected to discover (not copy) much the same con-\nstraints. For example, most languages don\u2019t encourage\ntheir learners to explore the constraint space for sign-\nlanguage phonology, but in those that do, learners seem\nto end up finding the same constraints (Brentari 1998).\nContraBloch and Hudson, then, theories of constraint dis-\ncovery have more substance than the banal observation that\nlearning plays a role in constraint acquisition; they require\nthat constraints be grounded in precultural universals.\nAnother take on these issues comes from Miers and\nNevins. Miers outlines a version of Optimality Theory\napplied to kin terminology that departs substantially\nfrom the standard version in its treatment of faithfulness\nand markedness. This work might have a place within\nthe framework outlined by Nevins, who discusses a\nrange of theories in phonology that may deliver some of\nthe same results as OT without using OT. Following the\nhypothesis of Cross-Modular Structural Parallelism,\nNevins suggests that phonology and kin terminology may\nrepresent the same linguistic architecture operating on\ntwo different \u201calphabets.\u201d If this proposal can be made\nto work, it may offer a new approach to delimiting the\npotential scope of grammar. Clearly this is a large topic\nthat deserves more attention than I give it here.\nR1.2. Kinship space and other conceptual spaces\nBecause different domains of conceptual structure represent\nvery different sorts of content, we might expect them to be\norganized very differently. However, according to the\ntarget article, the conceptual structure of kinship borrows\nmuch of its organization from the conceptual structure of\nspace. This result is consistent with other research finding\nparallel organization across semantic fields. Together with\nevidence regarding conceptual structure in nonhuman\nprimates, this may have implications for the evolution of\ncognition; I discuss several relevant responses below.\nBennardo\u2019s work considerably advances our under-\nstanding of the extension of spatial thinking to more\nabstract domains (and counters the skepticism on this\nscore of El Guindi and McConvell). He demonstrates a\nrelationship between universals of spatial cognition and\nuniversals of kinship cognition. But he goes further,\nfinding systematic covariation between cultures of space\nand kinship: A culture that prefers one frame of reference\nover another for representing space is likely to make a par-\nallel choice in representing kinship. This work goes\nbeyond the target article in demonstrating the integration\nof culture across cognitive domains.\nSeyfarth & Cheney (see also Cheney & Seyfarth 2007)\nreview evidence that many nonhuman primates not only\nrecognize their kin, but also have abstract representations\nof social categories that facilitate social inference. They\nnote that some of these representations, and the vocaliza-\ntions associated with them, may be categorical rather than\nmetric, digital rather than analog. Their observations\nimply that the organizing principles of human kin terminol-\nogy \u2013 sex, kinship distance and grade (rank), and group\nmembership \u2013 are probably primitives of social cognition\nin nonhuman primates and other social mammals and\nbirds. Thoughts about kinship and other social relationships\nmay be the first abstract thoughts that any animal had.\nWhat are the roots of social cognition? Cross-domain\nparallels in the organization of conceptual structure\nmight reflect the human gift for metaphorical thinking,\nbut the evidence for abstract thinking about social\nResponse\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 405\nrelationships in nonhuman primates suggests an evolution-\nary scenario. The mental organs adapted to representing\nspace seem to have been exapted to represent more\nabstract relationships, starting with kinship and social\norganization. Modeling kin relationships as relationships\nin an abstract kinship space would have some immediate\npayoffs, allowing inferences like: \u201cIf A is above B and B\nis above C, then A is above C,\u201d and so on. This scenario\nimplies that homology as well as adaptation has played a\nrole in the evolution of the mind. The conceptual structure\nof kinship may be adapted for doing genealogy and solving\nsocial problems on Pleistocene savannahs, but it may also\nowe some of its organization to a more ancient history.\nR1.3. Kinship, from conceptual structure to social\nstructure\nConceptual structure is likely used not only in communi-\ncation, but in cognition and social interaction more gener-\nally. In the target article, the focus was on kin terminology,\nwhich gives a particularly clear view of the conceptual\nstructure of kinship. However, as a number of commenta-\ntors remark (or complain), there is more to human kinship\nthan kin terms (Bloch, Gerkey & Cronk, Knight,\nLevinson). This section responds to these comments by\nbriefly sketching the broader relevance of the CS&G\ntheory to social coordination and social structure. The dis-\ncussion covers some of the games people play involving\ntheir kin and how conceptual structure may influence\nthe outcomes of these games. This may be part of a\nlarger story, of how universal conceptual primitives facili-\ntate convergence on shared moral norms in a number of\nsocial domains.\nMarriage, in particular deciding who may marry whom,\nis one social arena in which human beings often find\nthemselves playing coordination games. An accepted set\nof rules, even if partly arbitrary, that divide each person\u2019s\nrelations into marriageable and unmarriageable on the\nbasis of kinship can regulate sexual competition and\nfoster suprafamilial alliances.\nAnother family of coordination games involving kin may\ninvolve what I have labeled group nepotism (Jones 2000;\n2004). Altruism toward kin is a public good. Natural selec-\ntion favors higher levels of kin altruism if people coordi-\nnate their assistance than if each acts separately. When\ntwo brothers, for example, must choose how much help\nto give a needy third brother, their effective coefficient\nof relatedness when they act independently is the standard\nHamiltonian 1\/2; when they act together it ranges up to\n7\/10. (The mathematics involved is covered in Jones\n[2000] as \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov Game.\u201d) Especially\nin large groups of distant kin, the evolutionarily expected\nlevel of altruism toward the needy is much higher if\ngroups can impose enforceable public commitments on\ntheir members. This may be relevant to the distribution\nof gains from collective action in large descent-based\ngroups like the Lamalera whale hunting parties (Alvard\n2003) cited by Gerkey & Cronk, and more generally to\nthe establishment of norms of generalized (rather than\nbalanced) reciprocity among kin.\nThe norms that govern marriage and socially imposed\naltruism toward kin have some of the same structure as\nthe rules that govern kin terminology. Both terms and\nnorms are sensitive to genealogical distance, but allow\nother principles to orient and reshape kinship space. Kin\nterminologies often treat parallel or unilineal relations as\ncloser than cross or non-unilineal; marriage rules often\nuse the same distinctions to divide kin into those too\nclose to marry and those preferred or prescribed as\nspouses. Kin terminologies sometimes move affines into\nthe consanguine category \u2013 for example, treating a\nsister-in-law as a kind of sister; marriage rules sometimes\nfollow suit, extending incest taboos to affines (He\u00b4ritier\n2002). Kin terminologies may treat certain classes of\nsibling as equivalent \u2013 for example, equating a woman\u2019s\nson and her sister\u2019s son; norms of sharing may be built\naround the ideal (often evaded in practice, of course) of\nthe unity of the sibling group. More generally, both\nterms and norms impose categorical distinctions on a con-\ntinuously varying world. \u201c[K]inship systems have a digital\ncharacter\u201d (Levinson) and \u201ca formal kinship system is\ndesigned to minimize scope for disputation: It does this\nby eliminating shades of grey\u201d (Knight).\nThe parallels between kin terminology and social organ-\nization are a familiar topic in social anthropology. They are\ncommonly assumed to result from the influence of each\nculture\u2019s social structure on its terminology (see sect.\nR2.2). But I suggest there is something more going on:\nNorms and terms have some of the same structure\nbecause they draw on the same conceptual building\nblocks. Both of these causal pathways are discernible in\nFigure 1 in the target article. The first pathway starts from\n\u201clocal organization\u201d and follows the arrows along the\nbottom row to \u201ckin terminology.\u201d The second starts from\n\u201cprimitives of conceptual structure\u201d and follows the arrows\neither to \u201clocal organization\u201d or to \u201ckin terminology.\u201d\nThe dependence of both moral codes and semantic\ngrammar on universal conceptual primitives may be a\ngeneral phenomenon, applying to more than kinship\n(Pinker 2007, pp. 228\u201333). For example, in making judg-\nments about the morality of causing and avoiding harm,\npeople normally do not rely on the maxim of the greatest\ngood for the greatest number, but turn instead to intui-\ntions deriving from the conceptual structure of causation\nand agency (Mikhail 2007; see Wierzbicka for the corre-\nsponding conceptual primitives: because, do, and happen).\nThe hypothesis, then, is that the CS&G theory is rel-\nevant to the social organization of kinship because the\ningredients of conceptual structure go into the making of\nsocial structure. The outcomes of coordination games\ndepend not just on material factors, but on the mutual\nknowledge that players bring to the table, including knowl-\nedge deriving from precultural universals of cognition.\nThis hypothesis, although rooted in an evolutionary per-\nspective on human behavior, departs from theories in\nhuman behavioral ecology in which social organization is\nthe unintended by-product of individual strategizing\namong inclusive-fitness-maximizers \u2013 monads with\ngonads. Representations of the social order \u2013 not just as\nit is, but as it should be \u2013 play a role in making society.\nR2. Kinship, meet conceptual structure and\ngrammar\nThe previous section reviewed the potential relevance of\nkinship to several research programs in the cognitive\nsciences. This section considers the other side of the\nResponse\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n406 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nexchange: the relevance of recent work in linguistics and\ncognitive sciences to kin terminology. The section offers\na defense in detail of the CS&G theory against a range\nof criticism, especially from advocates of rival theories.\nSome of Kronenfeld\u2019s remarks serve to frame the dis-\ncussion here. He notes that the target article considers\nonly a portion of English and Seneca terminology, and\nhe asks what the present theory buys us that we don\u2019t\nget from other approaches. This section addresses both\nthese issues. In reply to several commentators who raise\nquestions about the mechanics of the theory, I expand\nthe discussion of the Seneca case, and also show how the\nproposed constraints apply to some of the Chinese data\npresented by Liu, Ge, Mai, & Luo (Liu et. al.) I hope\nthis part of the reply offers some assurance that the\npresent theory can handle not just hand-picked examples,\nbut challenges raised by sharp critics, and additional data.\nSome commentators defend alternative approaches,\nincluding sociocultural explanations of kin terminology,\ncomponential analysis, and kinship algebra. I offer some\ncomments on these, and indicate what seem to be the\nadvantages of the present theory.\nThis section is necessarily somewhat technical. Readers\nunfamiliar with the details of kin terminology might\nchoose to skim in particular sections R2.2 (especially the\nmiddle) and R2.3.\nR2.1. Is the theory too complicated?\nBehme, Hudson, and Wierzbicka argue that the CS&G\ntheory is too complicated and unintuitive. Hudson starts\noff by proposing the \u201ceasier explanation\u201d that the structure\nof kin terminologies is overtly represented in native speak-\ners\u2019 terms. (See Coult 1966 for an early version of this.)\nHudson argues that, for example, the availability of the\ninclusive term parent in English allows the construction\nof further categories like aunt (parent\u2019s sister) and grand-\nfather (parent\u2019s father). But then he takes it back. As he\nobserves, the concept Sibling seems to be involved in\ndefining cousin (Parent\u2019s Sibling\u2019s Child), even though\nthe word sibling is used infrequently or not at all by\nmany English speakers. (In my anthropology classes, stu-\ndents usually define cousin disjunctively, as something\nlike aunt\u2019s or uncle\u2019s child.) Examples like this, rather\nthan an unnatural love of complexity for its own sake,\nhave led anthropologists to postulate extra levels of rep-\nresentation beyond what is overtly expressed. Thus the\nadvocates of componential analysis propose distinctive fea-\ntures as an underlying level of representation of kin terms,\nwhile the practitioners of kinship algebra distinguish the\nabstract structure of kin categories from the actual termi-\nnology, with the latter derived from the former by adding\nsex distinctions and\/or cross-sex equations.\nWierzbicka proposes that kin terms specific to one\nlanguage can be defined based on a few core kin terms lex-\nicalized more-or-less universally, \u201cfather,\u201d \u201cmother,\u201d\n\u201chusband,\u201d and \u201cwife.\u201d This proposal is part of a larger\nprogram of assembling a collection of universal semantic\nprimitives that can serve as building blocks for defining\nculture-specific words and concepts.\nI have no quarrel with the specific primitives on Wierz-\nbicka\u2019s carefully crafted list. However, the principle that\nwe explain the natives\u2019 use of language using only trans-\nlations of terms shared by the natives with everyone else\nruns into problems when we turn from the lexicon to\ngrammar. For example, the difference in verb argument\nstructure between \u201cShe rolled the ball\u201d and \u201cThe ball\nrolled\u201d turns on universally lexicalized concepts from\nWierzbicka\u2019s list, such as because, do, and happen. But\nto explain in detail which micro-classes of verbs take\nwhat constructions, and how this varies across languages,\nit is necessary to look \u201cunder the hood\u201d at the internal\nstructure of these concepts. This level of representation\nis not so evident in the lexicon, nor so readily accessible\nto the consciousness of native speakers (Pinker 2007, pp.\n65\u201373; see Legendre et al., 2006, for an OT treatment\nof verb micro-classes across languages.) The same\napplies to kin terms. We need to know something about\nthe feature structure or other relational properties of kin\ntypes to explain why \u201dmother and father\u201d is a natural\nclass but \u201dmother and husband\u201d is not.\nIn short, kin terminology is not simple. Like other areas of\ngrammar, it involves nonovert representations. It\u2019s not clear\nwhat the metric for complexity is, but the CS&G theory is\nnot notably more complex than any well-developed alterna-\ntive. If anything, the theory has the advantage of borrowing\nsome of its complexity from other domains of language and\ncognition. The machinery of Optimality Theory, and maybe\neven the local version of optimization supported here, is\nimported from outside the domain of kinship, while the con-\nceptual structure of kinship takes some of its organization\nfrom the conceptual structure of space.\nR2.2. Does kin terminology derive from social\norganization?\nVariation in kin terminology is correlated with variation in\nsocial organization. For example, bifurcate merging aunt\nand uncle terms are more common in societies with matri-\nlineal and\/or patrilineal descent groups or other social\ncategories (Murdock 1949, pp. 156, 164\u2013166, 180\u2013183;\nWhiting et al. 1988). (Bifurcate merging aunt terms\nmeans one word for Mother and Mother\u2019s Sister,\nanother word for Father\u2019s Sister; bifurcate merging\nuncle terms means one word for Father and Father\u2019s\nBrother, another word for Mother\u2019s Brother.) The\nSeneca, with bifurcate merging terminology and matrili-\nneal descent groups, fit this generalization.\nCorrelations between kin terminology and social organ-\nization and culture have led some anthropologists to argue\nthat sociocultural explanations can supersede cognitive-\nlinguistic ones in accounting for what is systematic in kin\nterminology. Hudson, Behme, Leaf, and perhaps Levin-\nson support social structural explanations of kin terminol-\nogy. El Guindi argues for understanding kinship as\nholistically \u201cembedded in cultural knowledge,\u201d effectively\ndenying the content\/structure distinction proposed in the\ntarget article. Jordan & Dunn argue that a historical\napproach to kin terminology \u201cimmediately reduces the\namount of variation that needs to be accounted for by\nthe OT framework.\u201d\nThe real question is whether arguments of this kind can\nbe cashed out in the form of hypotheses linking social cat-\negories and statuses to terminology in detail. The record of\npast attempts is not encouraging. A number of anthropol-\nogists have proposed explanations of kin terms along the\nlines of \u201c\u2018K\u2019 means \u2018woman of my mother\u2019s patriclan,\u2019\u201d or\n\u201c\u2018L\u2019 means \u2018resident male of my father\u2019s hamlet,\u2019\u201d but\nResponse\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 407\nthese typically have been shown not to predict the assign-\nment of kin terms very accurately (Gould 2000, pp. 371\u2013\n78; Lounsbury 1965). Seneca cousin terms provide a case\nin point: They are quite regular, but, as Kronenfeld,\nMcConvell, and Salazar note, the division they establish\nbetween classificatory siblings and cross cousins doesn\u2019t\nmap cleanly onto any social-structural divide. On present\nevidence, the effect of social organization on kin terminol-\nogy is mostly loose and indirect, filtered through cognitive-\nlinguistic principles.\nIdeally, then, a theory of kin terminology should be con-\nsistent with two findings: first, kin terminology correlates\nwith social organization; second, there is no one-to-one\nmapping between kin terms and social categories. The\nCS&G theory accounts for both findings by positing an\nindirect connection between social structure and kin ter-\nminology. Local social organization, acting probabilisti-\ncally and with some time lag, influences the local ranking\nof universal kin term constraints. This ranking in turn gen-\nerates kin terminologies through constraint interaction\ngoverned by principles of Optimality Theory. This is\nshown in Figure 1 in the target article, where a series of\narrows runs along the bottom row from \u201clocal organiz-\nation\u201d to \u201ckin terminology.\u201d\nThe rest of this subsection reviews a specific case, the\nrelationship between matrilineal descent and cousin ter-\nminology in Seneca, comparing several alternative\napproaches (Leaf, McConvell, Salazar) and taking a\nside trip through Chinese cousin terms (Liu et al.) to\nshow the strength and flexibility of the present theory.\nThe last two paragraphs summarize the argument.\nAccording to Leaf, \u201cSeneca terminology embodies\nSeneca social conceptions just as English terminology\nembodies English social conceptions.\u201d He writes that\nSeneca cousin terms \u201cform groups based on a specific con-\ntrast between own matrilineal clan as against all other\nclans. . . . Own brothers and sisters are grouped with\nmother\u2019s sister\u2019s children and contrasted with all other\nrelations on one\u2019s own generation. Children of ha-nih\n(father and father\u2019s brother) who are also children of\nown mother are in own sibling group, children of other\nha-nih are in the all others group.\u201d\nBut Leaf\u2019s account of Seneca terminology is wrong.\nMorgan, whom Leaf cites, is quite clear that the Seneca\ncontrast is not between mother\u2019s sister\u2019s children and all\nother cousins, but between cousins linked through same-\nsex parents and cousins linked through opposite-sex\nparents (Morgan 1997[1871], pp. 156\u2013157, 160\u2013161,\n162, Plates VI, VIII) \u2013 not matrilineal versus nonmatrili-\nneal cousins, in other words, but parallel versus cross.\nThe belief that social organization is directly reflected in\nkin terminology seems to have led Leaf to misread the\nevidence.\nMcConvell and Salazar approach the same topic from\nthe other end. Both note the ubiquity of parallel\/cross dis-\ntinctions in kin terminologies and propose that the rel-\nevant distinction is the sexually symmetrical one between\nlinks through same-sex and opposite-sex siblings. McCon-\nvell suggests this could be handled by a DISTINGUISH PAR-\nALLEL\/CROSS constraint. Applied to the Seneca case, this\nwould achieve descriptive adequacy at the cost of severing\nthe connection between kin terminology and social organ-\nization. The two commentators take this course because,\nalthough sympathetic to the use of Optimality Theory,\nthey are skeptical about one of the constraints in the\ntarget article, DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN. This constraint\nrequires that kin in Ego\u2019s matriline (stippled in Fig. 2)\nbe distinguished from kin in the adjacent matrilines of\nMother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Child (vertical stripes) and Father,\nFather\u2019s Sister, and Father\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child (horizontal\nstripes).\nThere are two issues at stake here. One involves the\nplacement of the boundary between adjacent matrikin. It\nmay be possible to redraw this boundary to make more\nroom for the parallel\/cross-sibling distinction McConvell\nand Salazar emphasize.1 But this revision, whatever its\nmerits, is of little consequence in the present case. The\nmore relevant issue is that McConvell and Salazar treat\nparallel versus cross as a single, sexually symmetrical dis-\ntinction. But DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN is asymmetric\nwith respect to sex \u2013 it registers distinctions based on\ndifferent maternal links, not different paternal links, con-\nsistent with Seneca matrilineality.\nClearly some discussion is needed of how a sexually\nasymmetric constraint can generate the sexually sym-\nmetric terminology of Seneca. The rest of this subsection\nsupplies this discussion, showing how DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN interacts with other constraints to generate a\nsexually symmetrical cousin terminology in the case of\nSeneca, while its patrilineal counterpart, DISTINGUISH\nPATRIKIN, interacts with a differently ranked set of con-\nstraints to generate the sexually skewed Chinese cousin\nterminology. This discussion, rather than uncovering a\nfatal flaw in DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, as McConvell and\nSalazar suppose, ends up showcasing a major strength\nof Optimality Theory: one constraint can produce a\nvariety of effects, depending on how it interacts with\nothers.\nTo show how the present theory generates different\ncousin terminologies, we start with the following abbre-\nviated version of the Seneca ranking, DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN \u00bb DISTINGUISH SEX \u00bb MINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIB-\nLINGS. (We ignore relative age here.) We can follow the\nprocess in slow motion if we stick to replacing just adjoin-\ning pairs of elements at each move. With the two parallel\ncousin types, Mother\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child and Father\u2019s Broth-\ner\u2019s Child, the first move is to replace Mother\u2019s Sister\nwith Mother (same matriline, same sex), and Father\u2019s\nBrother with Father (same matriline, same sex), generat-\ning Mother\u2019s Child and Father\u2019s Child respectively.\nThese replacements obey the injunction to MINIMIZE\nPARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS \u2013 including embedded Parent\u2019s\nSibling \u2013 and don\u2019t violate higher ranking constraints.\nThese outputs become inputs on the next round.\nBecause Father\u2019s Child does not belong to Father\u2019s matri-\nkin and so is not adjacent to Mother\u2019s matrikin, it can be\nmerged with Mother\u2019s Child, as some type of sibling.\nOn the other hand, the high-ranking DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN bars mergers of the two cross cousin types,\nMother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Child and Father\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child\nwith Parent\u2019s Child.2 The best the lower-ranking MINI-\nMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS can do is to insist that these\ntwo types be combined into a single cross cousin term.\nThus DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, interacting with other con-\nstraints, can generate a standard parallel\/cross distinction.\nBut in other contexts, DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN and\nDISTINGUISH PATRIKIN produce different effects.\nChinese cousin terms, presented by Liu et al., offer a\nResponse\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n408 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nserendipitous opportunity to show that the present con-\nstraints work well across a wider range of terminologies,\nan important desideratum in OT. In Chinese terminology,\na father\u2019s brother\u2019s children are separate both from sib-\nlings and from other cousins. Other cousins are lumped\ntogether, not distinguished as parallel or cross. In other\nwords, Chinese terms skew patrilineally.\nThe patrilineally skewed constraint, DISTINGUISH\nPATRIKIN, can generate the basic pattern of Chinese\ncousin terms as part of the ranking DISTINGUISH PATRI-\nKIN \u00bb DISTINGUISH DISTANCE \u00bb MINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIB-\nLING\u2019S ____ \u00bb DISTINGUISH SEX. (We ignore sex and\nrelative age of cousins here, and some obvious mor-\nphology.) There are two crucial differences here from\nthe Seneca ranking. First, Chinese assigns high rank to a\nconstraint attuned to patrilineal rather than matrilineal\ndistinctions, reflecting the patrilineal character of tra-\nditional Chinese society. Second, the constraint DIS-\nTINGUISH DISTANCE ranks high, and prevents parents\u2019\nsiblings and embedded parents\u2019 siblings from being\nmerged with parents and embedded parents. The distance\nconstraint prevents Mother\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child from being\nequated with Mother\u2019s Child, thus blocking the parallel\ncousin\/sibling equations seen in Seneca. In this context,\nMINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLING\u2019S ____, in interaction with\nlower-ranking constraints, enforces a merger of nonpatri-\nlineal cousins, rather than cross cousins.3\nIn summary, the asymmetrical constraints DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN and DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN can generate\neither symmetrical parallel\/cross distinctions like those\nin Seneca, or asymmetrical distinctions like those in\nChinese, depending on how they interact with other con-\nstraints. At least for now, it seems that the two skewed con-\nstraints are necessary, but an additional unskewed\nparallel\/cross constraint is superfluous.\nIn the end, the criticisms of Leaf and of McConvell\nand Salazar complement each other. Leaf presumes a\ndirect connection between Seneca matrilineality and\nSeneca terminology, and gets the facts about the latter\nwrong. McConvell and Salazar argue that the parallel\/\ncross distinctions observed in Seneca and other terminol-\nogies reflect the operation of one or more underlying par-\nallel\/cross principles, and leave Seneca terminology\ndivorced from Seneca social organization. In spite of\ntheir different conclusions, these commentators share\nthe assumption that the principles governing kin terminol-\nogies should be visible on the surface. By contrast, the\npresent theory, which distinguishes between underlying\nconstraints and the surface distinctions generated by\nconstraint interaction, has more room to accommodate\nsystematic but indirect connections between social struc-\nture and kin terminology.\nR2.3. Componential analysis\nComponential analysis treats kin terms as bundles of dis-\ntinctive features; the theory lacks separate machinery for\nhandling markedness and kin term extensions. Kay\ndefends \u201cli\u2019l ol\u2019 componential analysis\u201d as an alternative\nto the CS&G theory, which he claims cannot handle\nSeneca descending generation terms or extended cousin\nterms. This subsection corrects several mistakes in Kay\u2019s\ncomment, shows how the CS&G theory deals with some\nspecial characteristics of Seneca kin terms, and compares\ncomponential analysis and other approaches to distant kin\nterms.\nKay claims that the proposed constraint DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN can\u2019t handle Seneca terminology for children\nand siblings\u2019 children. These include sex-of-Ego distinc-\ntions with female and male speakers using different terms\nfor their kin. The pattern to be explained goes as follows:\nthe Seneca term for \u2018daughter\u2019 is also used for Woman\u2019s\nSister\u2019s Daughter and Man\u2019s Brother\u2019s Daughter. The\nterm for \u2018son\u2019 is also used for Woman\u2019s Sister\u2019s Son and\nMan\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son. Four additional terms cover\nWoman\u2019s Brother\u2019s Daughter, Woman\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son,\nMan\u2019s Sister\u2019s Daughter and Man\u2019s Sister\u2019s Son. According\nto Kay, \u201cHere the OT analysis fails. Ego\u2019s sister\u2019s child is a\nmember of Ego\u2019s matriline regardless of Ego\u2019s sex.\u201d\nHowever, the second sentence is true, but irrelevant to\nthe issue at hand. What matters is Ego\u2019s children\u2019smatriline\n(not Ego\u2019s matriline, as Kay has it), because some of Ego\u2019s\nsibling\u2019s children, and not others, are classified with Ego\u2019s\nchildren (not with Ego) as \u2018daughter\u2019 and \u2018son.\u2019 Whether\nEgo\u2019s children belong to Ego\u2019s sister\u2019s matriline depends\non the sex of Ego: \u201cyes\u201d if Ego is female, \u201cno\u201d if Ego is\nmale. DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN gets this right.\nThe machinery for handling a terminology of this sort\nwas discussed in Jones (2003b). It can be used to\naccount for markedness relationships involving sex-of-\nEgo distinctions. We begin with a notation for inverse\nkin terms: if X is K to Y, then Y is K21 to X. If John is\nuncle to Dylan, then Dylan is uncle21 (i.e., Man\u2019s Sibling\u2019s\nChild) to John (ignoring uncles by marriage; see also\nGould 2000, p. 28). In this notation, the six Seneca\nterms above are female and male versions of Child,\n(Father\u2019s Sister)21, and (Mother\u2019s Brother)21. This nota-\ntion shows that Seneca does not distinguish nieces and\nnephews from aunts and uncles as clearly as English\ndoes. This is evident not only in the distribution of terms\nbut in their morphology. The Seneca term for my\nmother\u2019s brother is roughly \u2018he-uncle-me,\u2019 while the\nterms for the inverse, my sister\u2019s daughter\/son (man\nspeaking), are built from the same root and are roughly\n\u2018I-uncle-her\/him\u2019 (Kay 1975). The inverseness of Seneca\ndescending generation terms is there in plain sight.\nThe target article presented a DISTINGUISH GRADE\nconstraint. The constraint keeps ascending and descend-\ning generations separate, and older and younger kin\nwithin a generation. In doing so, it prevents a kin type\nfrom being equated with its inverse. But Seneca presents\nan in-between case, in which some descending generation\nterms are neither completely distinct nor completely sep-\narate from the corresponding ascending generation terms.\nWe can handle this by breaking DISTINGUISH GRADE into\ntwo constraints, one of which is more lax about enforcing\nhierarchical distinctions. Consider the following constraint\nranking:\nDISTINGUISH GENERATIONS & DISTANCE\nDISTINGUISH MATRIKIN\nMINIMIZE COUSINS\nDISTINGUISH GRADE (LAX)\nDISTINGUISH SEX\nMINIMIZE SIBLINGS\u2019 CHILDREN\nMINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS\nMINIMIZE SIBLINGS\nDISTINGUISH GRADE (STRICT)\nResponse\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 409\nMINIMIZE CHILDREN\nDISTINGUISH DISTANCE\nThis repeats the constraint ranking for Seneca from the\ntarget article, with several changes: (1) DISTINGUISH\nGRADE comes in a lax version, which allows partial\nequations of inverses, and a strict one, which doesn\u2019t, (2)\ntwo markedness constraints have been added for the first\ndescending generation, and (3) DISTINGUISH GENER-\nATIONS has been tweaked to allow mergers in equidistant\ngenerations (see Note 2 in target article).\nThe new constraint ranking handles the special features\nof Seneca terms for descending generations (and younger\nsiblings) without much extra machinery. Changing the\nranking can generate distinctions found in other\nlanguages. For example, moving MINIMIZE CHILDREN\nup one place would produce a terminology with distinc-\ntions between Father21 (Man\u2019s Child) and Mother21\n(Woman\u2019s Child). And the same trick of breaking up faith-\nfulness constraints into graded lax and strict versions can\nhandle other sorts of morphological variation, like\nwhether Seneca sex distinctions are carried by roots or\naffixes, or how English -in-law, grand-, and great- affixes\nwork (a topic raised by Leaf).\nKay also rejects the proposed analysis of Seneca cousin\nterm extension by one-adjoining-pair-at-a-time replace-\nment. \u201c[N]o such set of local rules can account for the\nSeneca cross\/parallel facts.\u201d This is wrong. Take the kin\ntype that he gives, the fourth cousin \u201cfather\u2019s mother\u2019s\nfather\u2019s mother\u2019s brother\u2019s daughter\u2019s son\u2019s son\u2019s child.\u201d\nNote that in many cultures, nobody starts with such an\nelaborate formula when reckoning kin terms; they would\nbegin with \u201cMy father\u2019s \u2018cross cousin\u2019 is father to that\nperson\u201d (Levinson, Read). In other words, Kay\u2019s\nformula is to kin terminology what one of Proust\u2019s long\nsentences is to syntax: a possible case that one would be\nunlikely to encounter in everyday life. Nonetheless, a set\nof one-adjoining-pair-at-a-time replacement rules follow-\ning the constraint ranking in section 3.1 in the target\narticle gives the right answer, with no need to \u201cimagine\nrewrite rules that look. . .at nonadjacent nodes.\u201d4\nKay claims that \u201ccomponential analysis, gets the whole\njob done . . . with less machinery.\u201d This is not quite right.\nComponential analysis gets the job done in fewer steps\n(in a highly artificial example), but at the cost of more\nmachinery, in the form of a special Iroquois-cross distinc-\ntive feature. This is problematic, regardless of whether we\nuse componential analysis or Optimality Theory. There are\na variety of ways of extending terms to more distant kin\n(Godelier et al. 1998): Does each of these call for a new\ndistinctive feature or a new constraint?\nPerhaps rules for distant kin term extensions are\nopen-ended and transmitted through explicit instruction,\nmore like rules for games or poetic forms than rules of\ngrammar. In this case, there would be no theoretical\nproblem with multiplying distinctions indefinitely. Or\nperhaps humans have specialized adaptations for classify-\ning kin all the way out to second cousins. This is Miers\u2019\nposition, if I have understood him correctly.\nBut there is a more parsimonious possibility: Distinc-\ntions may emerge through the interaction of a limited\nset of constraints according to rules of local optimization.\nTo explore this further, let us return to the second-\ncousin formula Mother\u2019s Mother\u2019s Brother\u2019s Son\u2019s Son.\nIn Seneca, the categorization of this relative as a cross\ncousin rather than some kind of sibling depends only on\nthe sexes of the two linking relatives in the parental gener-\nation. The sex of the two linking relatives in the grandpar-\nental generation is irrelevant. In other terminologies, the\nopposite is true: A cross-sex connection in the grandparen-\ntal generation determines the classification regardless of\nthe sexes in the parental generation. And in so-called Dra-\nvidian terminologies, sexes in both parental and grandpar-\nental generations make a difference to the outcome. This\nlooks like a markedness\/faithfulness trade-off between\nneutralizing linking-sex distinctions in one generation or\nthe other, and accounting carefully for both generations,\nin the course of local optimization. In other words, it\nlooks like a good fit for the machinery developed in the\ntarget article. At this stage, we cannot be sure this is the\nright approach, but it seems worth exploring.5\nOne final note on distinctive features: while componen-\ntial analysis probably doesn\u2019t work as a complete theory, it\ncan generate some common patterns on its own. For\nexample, we can get from bifurcate merging aunts\n(Father\u2019s Sister=Mother\u2019s Sister \u00bc Mother) to bifurcate\ncollateral (Father\u2019s Sister=Mother\u2019s Sister=Mother)\nby activating a distance (or lineal\/collateral) distinction.\nMusgrave & Dowe, however, think this has to do with\ndifferential markedness: that in the first case, but not the\nsecond, cross-kin are marked relative to parallel. On the\nstandard definition of markedness (Jones 2004) this is\nwrong. The reason the distance distinction doesn\u2019t split\nFather\u2019s Sister in the second case is that there\u2019s no dis-\ntance inside Father\u2019s Sister to split, not because the type\nis marked. For an example that does involve differential\nmarkedness, see the relative age distinctions among\nChinese uncles in Liu et al.\u2019s comment, which are acti-\nvated for the unmarked but not the marked type.\nR2.4. Kinship algebra\nRead lays out the basics of kinship algebra, an alternative\napproach to kin terminology. He argues for a strict separ-\nation between (1) kin terminologies as formal systems to\nbe studied in the framework of abstract algebra, without\nreference to genealogy, and (2) rules mapping kin ter-\nminologies onto genealogy. Lyon also cautions that\n\u201ckinship terminologies can be produced without reference\nto any notion or instance of genealogical relatedness.\u201d\nI respond with a parable.\nOnce upon a time, Professor P developed a formal\ntheory of the shape of pants, called pants geometry.\nPants geometry borrowed from topology and other\nbranches of mathematics, taking into account, for\nexample, that pants are highly symmetrical from right to\nleft, but not from top to bottom. With a modest set of par-\nameters, the theory claimed to account for the shapes of\neverything from bell-bottoms to lederhosen to skorts.\nWith this theory in hand, Professor P announced that\npants could be defined in purely geometric terms\nwithout reference to the human form. He also reminded\nhis readers that many pants, including most of those\ngiven as birthday presents, are never worn. He declared\nthat the old anthropomorphic definition of pants as a\ngarment worn on the lower body and covering the legs\nseparately had at last been overturned, and deplored the\nsloppy habit of referring to pants \u201clegs.\u201d\nResponse\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\n410 BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5\nOf course Professor P\u2019s victory over anthropomorphism\nin the field of pants studies was illusory. It\u2019s not just a\ncoincidence that pants and people have legs and seats,\nthat men\u2019s pants generally have flies and men have . . .,\netc. Similarly, it is not a necessary truth, but an empirical\nfinding in need of theoretical explanation, that every\nsociety has a system of terms systematically related to\none another in such a way that they can be mapped onto\ngenealogical positions, and that the natives themselves\ncan do this mapping \u2013 even if those terms are used for\nnongenealogical purposes as well.\nI suggest that a contrast proposed by Sperber (1996, pp.\n134\u201346) is useful here, between the evolved (or proper)\ndomain of an adaptation, and its cultural domain (see\nalso Sperber & Hirschfeld 2004). For example, humans\nin all likelihood have evolved machinery for assessing the\nmental states of others (the evolved domain of \u201ctheory of\nmind\u201d), but they also employ this machinery in culturally\nspecific ways in attributing mental states to ghosts,\noracles, storms, and agents of disease (the cultural\ndomain of theory of mind). Perhaps the way to break out\nof the seemingly endless argument about what kinship\nterms \u201creally\u201d mean is to ask instead about the evolved\nand cultural domains of kin categorization. From this per-\nspective, Read\u2019s achievement is an exceptionally rigorous\ncharacterization of the machinery for tracking genealogy\n(and maybe for doing other things; see sect. R1.3).\nThere are more down-to-earth differences between\nkinship algebra and the current approach. Part of what\ncharacterizes kin terminologies, according to kinship\nalgebra, are structural equations. Some of these are uni-\nversal, defining the very domain of kinship (e.g., Sibling\nof Sibling \u00bc Sibling), others are found in some terminolo-\ngies but not others (e.g., the English rule Spouse of\nSibling \u00bc Sibling of Spouse). These equations have conse-\nquences that ramify through kinship systems and give\nthem much of their structure. But there is the same\nproblem with structural equations as with replacement\nrules: it\u2019s not clear within the theory what limits there\nare on allowed equations.\nR2.5. Comparing theories\nBy way of a summary, let\u2019s return to Kronenfeld\u2019s ques-\ntion: What does the present theory buy us that we don\u2019t\nget from other approaches? Some of the alternative\ntheories imply that kin terminology is psychologically\nsimple, perhaps because its complexities derive from the\nsocial system rather than the mind. But these theories\nseem to have trouble accounting for kin terminology in\ndetail. The other alternatives, which allow for autonomous\ncognitive-linguistic processes, have different strengths and\nweaknesses. Componential analysis has identified a set of\ndistinctive features, comparable to those in phonology,\nthat help to define the natural classes into which kin\ntypes are organized. Yet markedness effects are generally\nleft out, and descriptive adequacy achieved only at the\ncost of multiplying contrived, undermotivated features.\nDerivational approaches, including reduction rules and\nkinship algebra, are successful in showing how rules for\nextending kinship terms out from a small core can\naccount for patterns of variation in particular cases, but\nleave unanswered questions about what replacement\nrules or structural equations are allowed. As Levinson\nwrites, \u201c[p]revious approaches, such as componential\nanalysis and reduction rule analysis. . .have each captured\npart of the phenomenon but somehow have failed to give\nus an exhaustive way to think about the typology of kinship\nsystems.\u201d\nIdeally we would like to get the best of each of these\napproaches in one package. In a package deal, for\nexample, we might find that the range of possible replace-\nment rules is somehow constrained by the need to respect\ndistinctive features. This deal, I claim, is what the present\ntheory offers, by including distinctive features and mark-\nedness effects in a unified framework, and handling deri-\nvations by stepwise optimization. That the deal also\nincludes a new take on the relationship between social\nstructure and kin terminology, and on the conceptual\nstructure of kinship, makes it even more of a bargain.\nR3. Prospects\nSuppose, as the preceding section argues, that no insuper-\nable impediments stand in the way of the Conceptual\nStructure and Grammar theory of kin terminology. In\nthat case, what are some directions the theory might\ntake in the future?\nSeveral commentators (Behme, Bloch, and Levinson)\nclaim that there is little evidence for the psychological\nmechanisms proposed in the target article. But whatever\ntruth there is in this charge stems not so much from any\nweakness of the theory as from the woefully underdeve-\nloped state of the study of kinship and cognition. The\ninformation we have on kinship terminologies across cul-\ntures is currently some of our best evidence in this area,\nand a lot more could be done with it. However, the typo-\nlogical evidence needs to be supplemented with other\nlinguistic evidence, from morphology, pragmatics\n(Bloch, Hogeweg et al.), and language history (Jordan\n& Dunn), and from semantic fields beyond kinship (Ben-\nnardo). And the methods of cognitive science, including\ndevelopmental studies, need to be brought to bear.\nThe research reported by Liu et al. is an excellent\nexample of what can be done. The authors correctly ident-\nify the major constraints active in Chinese kin terminology\naccording to the present theory, and find significant effects\nin the expected direction for most of these (except for the\nrelative age constraint) on the processing of kin terms.\nThis is an important preliminary indication that work on\nkin terminology has identified real psychological pro-\ncesses. (For additional results along the same lines, com-\nparing the processing of kinship formulas by English and\nTongan speakers, see Bennardo & Read 2010.) It may\nturn out that Levinson\u2019s remark, \u201cIt is quite unwarranted\n(despite the normal claims of OT) to think that any one\nnative speaker has this kind of meta-knowledge in his or\nher head,\u201d is too skeptical.\nFinally, it is possible that the future will demonstrate\nnot just the psychological reality of some version of the\nmachinery proposed here, but its broader value to the\nhuman sciences. In the study of grammar, for example,\nkin terminology may be of interest as involving an elemen-\ntary variety of recursion more tractable than that found in\nsyntax (Read 2008). And in the study of social cognition\nand social structure, the interplay of universals and vari-\nation in the rules dividing kin into marriageable and\nResponse\/Jones: Human kinship, from conceptual structure to grammar\nBEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:5 411\nnon-marriageable may offer new insights into the combi-\nnatorial structure of moral systems. If the CS&G theory\ncan develop as a progressive research program, kinship\nmay emerge as a model system for the study of important\nissues in cognition and social organization.\nNOTES\n1. In the target article (including Figs. 2 and 3) and the reply,\nDISTINGUISH MATRIKIN counts a man as a member of his\nmother\u2019s and sister\u2019s matrikin, and DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN\ncounts a woman as a member of her father\u2019s and brother\u2019s patri-\nkin. Suppose we revise this. Let DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN count a\nwoman, her sisters, and her parents as members of one matrikin,\nand her brothers and their wives as members of an adjacent\nmatrikin. And let DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN count a man, his broth-\ners, and his parents as members of one patrikin, and his sisters\nand their husbands as members of an adjacent patrikin. This revi-\nsion builds a parallel\/cross-sibling distinction into both con-\nstraints. It also lumps wives and husbands together as parallel\n(members of the same matrikin and patrikin), but these can be\nseparated by DISTINGUISH AFFINES as needed. There may be\nsome advantages to this. Together with a new markedness con-\nstraint, MINIMIZE CROSS-SIBLINGS, the revised constraints can\nnow handle parallel versus cross-sibling terms (e.g., Woman\u2019s\nSister versus Man\u2019s Sister). See Jones (2010) for details; either\nof the revised constraints here is equivalent to DBIF there.\n2. DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN bars mergers of cross cousins with\nparents\u2019 children. Here we spell this out on a case-by-case basis\n(with standard abbreviations including Z for Sister): Mother\u2019s\nBrother\u2019s Child (MBC) ! Father\u2019s Child (FC) is barred\nbecause MB and F are in adjacent matrilines; MBC ! MC is\nbarred because MBC and MC are in adjacent matrilines; FZC\n! MC is barred because FZ and M are in adjacent matrilines;\nFZC ! FC is barred because FZC and FC are in adjacent\nmatrilines.\n3. How this works: Mother\u2019s Sister\u2019s Child (MZC) is not\nindexed as falling either inside Ego\u2019s patriline or in an adjacent\none. So DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN allows this kin type to merge\neither with FBC (Ego\u2019s patriline) or with MBC and FZC (adja-\ncent patrilines). The decision falls to a lower ranking constraint.\nHere we assume that DISTINGUISH SEX assigns more constraint\nviolations to the double sex change in MZC ! FBC, thus\npushing MZC to merge with non-patrilineal cousins instead.\nHowever, if the ranking were changed by inserting DISTINGUISH\nMATRIKIN above DISTINGUISH SEX, the decision would go the\nother way, resulting in a merger of MZC and FBC, and a distinc-\ntion between siblings, parallel cousins, and cross cousins, as seen\nin other (Sudanic) terminologies.\n4. The rules are:\n1. Replace a doubly embedded parent\u2019s sibling (___Parent\u2019s\nSibling\u2019s___) with a doubly embedded parent of the appropriate\nsex,\n2. Replace a singly embedded parent\u2019s sibling (Parent\u2019s Sib-\nling\u2019s___) with a singly embedded parent of the appropriate sex\nonly if this is consistent with DISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, and\n3. Replace a parent\u2019s child with a sibling of the appropriate\nsex.\nThe result, applied to Kay\u2019s formula, and using standard abbrevi-\nations including S for Son and Z for Sister, is FMFMBDSSC !\nFMFFDSSC ! FMFZSSC ! FMMSSC ! FMBSC !\nFFSC ! FBC ! FC ! Sibling, where underline and\nbold show what will be and has been rewritten. The role of\nOptimality Theory here is to put constraints on possible replace-\nment rules \u2013 in this case producing a markedness effect where\nunilineal distinctions are neutralized in processing more distant\ncousin terms.\n5. Some more details; put one of the following constraints:\nDISTINGUISH MATRIKIN, DISTINGUISH PATRIKIN, or, if you\ninsist, DISTINGUISH PARALLEL\/CROSS,\nin one of the places marked by a number in the following ranking:\n(1) \u00bb MINIMIZE ___ PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS\u2019 ___ \u00bb DISTINGUISH\nAFFINES \u00bb (2) \u00bb MINIMIZE PARENTS\u2019 SIBLINGS\u2019 ___ \u00bb (3) \u00bb MINI-\nMIZE PARENT\u2019S SIBLINGS \u00bb (4).\nThe corresponding kin terminologies are:\n(1) Dravidian. Four replacement rules,\n(a) MZ ! M,\n(b) FB ! F,\n(c) ___MB___ ! ___EF___,\n(d) ___FZ___ ! ___EM___,\nwhere E is Spouse. Also, nothing bars the standard replacements\nParent\u2019s Child ! Sibling and Parent\u2019s Spouse ! Parent.\nThe result, applied to Kay\u2019s formula, is FMFMBDSSC !\nFMFEFDSSC ! FMFEZSSC ! FMMZSSC !\nFMMSSC ! FMBSC ! FEFSC ! FEBC ! MBC \u00bc\n\u2018cross cousin.\u2019 Moving DISTINGUISH AFFINES further down in\nthe ranking can result in a stronger version of Dravidian termi-\nnology, with rules like MB ! EF and FZ ! EM, and \u2018cross\ncousin\u2019 further reduced to \u2018spouse\u2019 or \u2018spouse\u2019s sibling.\u2019\n(2) Iroquois. See replacement rules in the previous note, and\ndiscussion of Seneca in target article.\n(3) Cheyenne. Cousins equated with siblings, bifurcate\nmerging aunts and uncles.\n(4) Generational. Cousins equated with siblings, aunts and\nuncles equated with parents.\nWe assume generational distinctions rank high and distance dis-\ntinctions low. On this account, Dravidian and Iroquois cousin\nterms fall along a markedness gradient with respect to unilineal\nor parallel\/cross distinctions, addressing the concerns of Kro-\nnenfeld and McConvell about where Seneca extended\ncousins fit into the larger picture.\nReferences\n[The letters \u201ca\u201d and \u201cr\u201d before author\u2019s initials stand for target article and\nresponse references, respectively.]\nAckerman, C.
