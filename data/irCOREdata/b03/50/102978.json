INTRODUCTION\nCarbon nanotubes sCNTsd are one dimensional materials\nwith outstanding mechanical and electronic properties. The-\noretical predictions on single-walled nanotubes sSWNTsd\nsuggest an in-plane elastic modulus equal to a graphene sheet\nof ,1060 GPa.1 This is comparable to the hardest natural\ns001d diamond of 1050 GPa. Electron transportation in\nSWNTs depends on their chirality and diameter, which re-\nsults in either metallic or semiconducting properties. With\nideal electrical contacts, a metallic SWNT can behave like a\nquantum wire, yielding two units of quantum conductance\nsG=2 G0=4 e2 \/\"d and hence ballistic transport.2 Another\npotential application with considerable interest is using\nCNTs as a field emission cathode. Due to its large aspect\nratio and tube-like shape, CNTs are excellent electron field\nemitters which are suitable for cold cathodes in display ap-\nplications. In fact, low emission threshold fields and high\ncurrent densities have been obtained from CNTs. More re-\ncently, studies have illustrated the combination of using both\nmechanical and electronic properties of CNTs, such as exam-\nining bending and stressing of CNTs for electronic\napplications.3\u20135 Atomic force microscopy tips were used as\npoint-like gates to modulate the conductance of SWNT.5 By\napplying strain at a localized point along a SWNT, the con-\nductance decreases by a few orders of magnitude, suggesting\nthe possibility of using this technique for a nanoscale pres-\nsure sensor.\nSimulations have shown that the band gap of SWNTs vary\nlinearly with stress ssd, with a ratio of udEgap\/dsu\n=10.7 meV\/GPa.6 Using a modified semiempirical, tight-\nbinding approach and introducing a deformation potential, a\nsemiconductor to metal transition was predicted when s is\ngreater than 10 GPa.\nThe study of electronic properties with mechanical stress\nis important in view of the ability to manipulate carbon\nadElectronic mail: patrick.poa@surrey.ac.uk\n698 J.

Additionally, it is interesting to investigate the\nfield emission properties when mechanical stress is applied.\nIn this article, the electron field emission sFEd properties of\nmultiwalled carbon nanotube sMWNTd composite films were\ninvestigated as a function of applied mechanical stress.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nThe MWNT composite films were prepared by mixing\npurified MWNTs s8 wt % concentrationd with polystyrene\nsPSd. Sample preparation has been described previously in\nRef. 7. Briefly, the MWNTs were synthesised using a dc arc\ndischarge technique. Two graphite rods were used as elec-\ntrodes in a water-cooled vacuum chamber. Helium gas was\nintroduced into the chamber to a process pressure of\n100 Torr and an arc was struck with a high current s120 Ad\npower supply. The as-produced MWNTs compromise of a\nmixture of small carbon particles with amorphous carbon,\nand no metal particles\/catalysts observed in the tubes. The\ncarbon mixture was first purified using microfiltering to re-\nmove carbon particles and mild oxidation at 400 \u00b0C to re-\nmove unwanted amorphous carbon. After purification,\nMWNTs were mixed with PS in toluene, with the mixture\nthen ultrasonificated for 60 min before transferring to a\nvacuum chamber for drying. To ensure good dispersion of\nCNTs and removal of voids in the composite films, the hard-\nened mixtures were subject to \u201chot pressing.\u201d Finally, the\nCNT\u2013PS films were cut into dimensions of 4325 mm, and a\nfilm thickness of about 250 mm. Figure 1sad shows an image\nof the MWNT\u2013PS film surface magnified to 6500 times in a\nscanning electron microscope. MWNTs can be seen sticking\nout across the PS surface. The distribution of the MWNTs on\nthe surface appears patchy and selective in Fig. 1sad, but the\noverall distribution is considered to be even over a sample\narea of 100 mm2. In Fig. 1sbd, the sample was intentionally\nbroken into half to form a \u201chairy fracture.\u201d The cross-\nsectional view of the composite film shows that MWNTs are\nwell dispersed in the PS matrix and are uniaxially oriented.\n698\/23\u00842\u0085\/698\/4\/$22.00 \u00a92005 American Vacuum Society\nw tha\n699 Poa et al.: Influence of mechanical stress on electron field 699This partial orientation of the nanotubes is due to the effect\nof \u201chot pressing\u201d during the preparation process. It can also\nbe seen from Fig. 1sbd that there is a variation in the nano-\ntube diameter and length but generally, these tubes are about\n10\u201330 nm in diameter and 3\u20135 mm long.\nElectron field emission measurements were performed us-\ning a scanning probe technique. The anode is a 5 mm diam-\neter stainless steel ball bearing suspended directly above the\nsample. The base pressure of the vacuum chamber was kept\nbelow 5310\u22126 Torr during the measurements. The anode is\nattached to a stepper motor where the distance between the\nanode and sample can be varied at a 2.5 mm step size. The\nanode also has an X\u2013Y movement of 25325 mm scan area.\nThe anode to sample separation is maintained between 80\nand 120 mm during the measurements and the applied volt-\nage was swept from 0 to 2200 V. The gap between the\nsample and anode is determined by lowering the probe onto\nthe sample surface while a small voltage is applied. Current\nflow is detected when the probe is in contact with the sur-\nface. The macroscopic electric field is defined here as the\napplied voltage over the anode to sample separation. Thresh-\nold electric field sEthd is defined as the applied electric field\nwhere a FE current of 1 nA is observed. Each sample is\nmeasured four times and the threshold field represents the\naverage value of all four measurements. We find that the\nerror bar is within 5%\u201310%. Mechanical stress was applied\nto the sample using a simple three-point bending technique\nshown in Fig. 2. The samples are bent using an optical fibre\nplaced in the middle of the sample and two glass slides then\nused to clip both ends of the sample to create strain across\nthe sample. Optical fibre diameters ranging from\n50 to 1000 mm were used to allow different levels of\nstresses to be applied to the sample. In this setup, maximum\nstress is concentrated around the center of the sample above\nthe fiber region and the scanning probe was suspended above\nFIG. 1. SEM images of the MWNT-composite film: sad top view showing th\non the film surface. sbd The sample was intentionally cracked in half to shothis region for FE measurements.\nJVST B - Microelectronics and Nanometer StructuresIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe FE characteristics for MWNT\u2013PS films subject to\ndifferent mechanical stress are shown in Fig. 3. The control\nsample, which did not experience any mechanical bending\nshows an emission threshold field of 2.3 V\/mm. The emis-\nsion current shows an exponential characteristic with applied\nfield, which resembles a Fowler\u2013Nordheim sFNd like emis-\nsion process. As the mechanical stress increases with the\nintroduction of larger diameter glass fibers ranging from\n125 to 500 mm, Eth decreases from 2.3 to 0.6 V\/mm. Inter-\nestingly, when the glass fiber size is further increased to\n1000 mm, Eth for this sample increases from\n0.6 to 3.1 V\/mm. Current saturation effects are also ob-\nserved in the emission currents which suggests a ballasting\neffect of the matrix. Plastic deformation of the sample can be\nobserved after bending the sample at 1000 mm. It was noted\nthat the surface of the sample snot shown hered when subject\nto the highest deformation results in the melting of the poly-\nstyrene if suitable precautions are not taken like using a cur-\nrent limiter. In general, polystyrene turns into plastic from\nabout a temperature of 100 \u00b0C and melts at 340 \u00b0C. This\nsuggests that when the films are bent at high curvature, me-\nNTs are embedded in the polymer matrix while some tubes are still visible\nt the tubes are uniaxially oriented along the substrate.\nFIG. 2. Experimental setup of the three-point bending stage, where the\nsample is clamped on both sides with glass clips and the glass fiber size ise MWvaried to introduce different curvature.\n700 Poa et al.: Influence of mechanical stress on electron field 700chanical stress induces changes to the MWNT\u2013PS film re-\nsulting in an increase in the sample temperature when sub-\njected to field emission. This is likely to be due to increased\nlocalised current conduction around the stressed regions.\nThe variation in Eth as a function of the fiber size is sum-\nmarized in Fig. 4. The emission threshold fields in this work\nare much lower that those reported in the literature. Usually,\nfield emission from materials such as amorphous carbon,\nemits in the range of 20\u201330 V\/mm. This again supports the\nfact that CNTs are excellent electron field emitters. The field\nemission mechanism is usually explained by FN type emis-\nsion, and, the high field enhancement is due to the high as-\npect ratio from these nanosized tubes. This field enhance-\nment factor is related to the height over the tube radius ratio.\nHowever, when CNTs are closely packed together, electric\nfield screening effects often affect the emission current and\ndecreases the field enhancement factor. This field screening\neffect can be minimized by increasing the separation distance\nbetween individual tubes. Current saturation effects are also\ncommon in field emission from CNTs. This is attributed to\nthe absorbates on the CNT surface and can be removed by\nconditioning of the tubes.\nRecent work has shown that when CNTs are mixed into\npolymer, the field emission threshold fields8 can improve due\nto the introduction of a triple junction effect. The mixture of\nthe CNT, dielectric, and vacuum creates a space charge re-\ngion which allows enhanced electron field emission. In this\nwork, we observe that those nanotubes found on the sample\nsurface are mainly short tubes embedded in the polymer sand\nthus no high enhancement due to h \/rd. The field emission\nrecorded in our films is enhanced by the triple junction ef-\nfect, which give rise to lower threshold fields.\nOne possible source as to the improvement in field emis-\nsion characteristics is the variation in the physical properties\nwhen straining the CNTs are subjected to stress. At high\nstress, it is possible to create \u201cbuckling\u201d in the compressively\n9\nFIG. 3. Field emission current against applied electric field for samples bent\nwith different fiber sizes.

B, Vol. 23, No. 2, Mar\/Apr 2005studies have shown that in strained MWNT-composite films,\nfractures, and buckling sabout 18% and 5%, respectivelyd are\nobserved. This may suggest that the MWNTs subject to\nhigher curvature is beneficial to the field emission process.\nReports have also suggested that CNTs under strain can have\nan effect on the hybridization. Manipulation of a single\nwalled nanotube shows that deformation along the body of\nthe tube can cause a reversible transition from an sp2 to an\nsp3 bonding configuration in the region subject to the defor-\nmation. This leads to a 2 orders of magnitude decrease in the\noverall conductance.10 Interestingly, this could mean that the\nwork function along the body of the nanotube could be dif-\nferent when subjected to different degree of stress.\nThe work function sFd of a material is the energy re-\nquired to extract an electron from the surface. The F is re-\nlated to the threshold field in cold-cathode field emission of\nmaterials and can be chemically modulated\/enhanced by\ndoping with selected impurities.11 It has been realized that\nco-doping of O or N with low F metals can form metal\ndipoles on the surface and this was suggested to be a prom-\nising route12,13 in lowering the F at the material surface.\nHere we extend our discussion in lowering the work func-\ntion of CNTs by introducing a lattice contraction argument\nwhen the material is mechanically stressed. We extend the\ncurrent bond-order-length-strength sBOLSd correlation\nmechanism14 to the core-level shift in a nanosized material\nby including the effect surface relaxation and bond contrac-\ntion. The current BOLS correlation argument indicates that\nthe bond contraction not only deepens the atomic \u201cpotential\nwell,\u201d but also enhances the charge density in the relaxed\nsurface region. The confined electrons near the surface edge\nare usually denser and more localized. For an isolated nano-\nsolid of size Kj, the F satisfies sV~ sd\u00afdtd,15,16 where V is the\nvolume of a nanosolid, d\u00af is related to the bond distance due\nto lattice contraction, and t=1, 2, or 3 is the dimensionality\nFIG. 4. Variation of threshold fields as a function of different fiber size. The\nthreshold field is defined as the applied field when an emission current of\n1 nA is observed.for a plate, rod, and spherical rod, respectively.\n701 Poa et al.: Influence of mechanical stress on electron field 701The work function is given by F=E0\u2212EF and the Fermi\nenergy can be derived using\nEF ~ n2\/3 = sNe\/Vd2\/3 ~ sd\u00afd\u22122t\/3,\nwhere n is the number of electrons. Therefore, the variation\nin work function can be simplified to\nDFsKjd = \u2212 DEFsKjd . s1d\nIf we consider the total number of electrons Ne of a nano-\nsolid is conserved. At the lower end of the size limit of a\nspherical or semispherical dot sR,1 nm,t=3d, the average\nbond length is around 20% shorter than the bulk value and\nhence the F will reduce from the original value by 30%,\naccording to Eq. s1d. Using an He\u2013II ultraviolet beam source\nof 21.2 eV, Abbot et al.17 measured the F of the diamond\nh111j surface to be about 4.8 eV at a grain size of 108 mm.\nThe F of the diamond decreases with particle size to a mini-\nmum of 3.2 eV at an average grain size of about 4 mm, and\nthen the F recovers to a maximum of 5.1 eV at diamond\nparticle size of 0.32 mm. Rouse et al.18 noded that the field-\nemission threshold decreases from 3.8 to 3.4 V\/mm of poly-\ncrystalline diamond films at room temperature on molybde-\nnum tips as the diamond average grain size increases from\n0.25 to 6 mm. They related the F change to the increase in\nnegative electron affinity within the grain size due to in-\ncreased surface hydrogen bonding and with perhaps a con-\ntribution from surface defect states. The F of Na particles\naround 0.4\u20132.0 nm in size was measured to vary inversely\nwith the size R and lowered the bulk value from\n2.75 to 2.25 eV sby 18%d.19 The majority of the nanotubes\nhave a F of 4.6\u20134.8 eV20 at the tips, which is 0.2\u20130.4 eV\nlower than that of carbon sgraphited bulk. A small fraction of\nthe nanotubes have a F of ,5.6 eV,20 about 0.6 eV higher\nthan that of carbon sgraphited. This discrepancy is thought to\narise from the metallic and semiconducting characteristics of\nthe nanotubes.\nIt appears that the measured size-dependent F change for\ndiamond is in conflict with the BOLS prediction. However,\none needs to note that if the emitters are packed too closely,\nthe system is identical to a smooth surface. It has been\nfound21 that hydrogen-rich or oxygen-containing chemical\nvapor deposition sCVDd precursors could promote electron\nemission from discrete diamond particles and noncontinuous\ndiamond films, but not for high quality and continuous dia-\nmond films, nanocrystalline diamond, and glassy carbon\ncoatings even if they contain conductive graphitic carbon.\nThe F at the tips of individual multiwalled carbon nanotubes\nwas measured using a TEM to show no significant depen-\ndence on the diameter of the nanotubes in the range of\n14\u201355 nm.22 Although the calibrated diamond particles are\nmuch larger, the curvature of the tips should be much higher.\nThe particle size corresponds only to the separation of the\nsharp emitters. This phenomenon indicates the significance\nJVST B - Microelectronics and Nanometer Structuresof CN imperfection on the F reduction that is subject to the\nseparation between the nanoparticles and surface chemical\nstates.\nMechanical stress could raise the atomic binding and the\ntotal energy between a pair of atoms, the same effect as of\nheating and thus weakening the bond. Therefore, heating or\nstraining a nanotube should raise the Ne higher, and as a\nconsequence, minimize the gap between the p and p* bands,\nas proposed by Poa et al.23\nIV. SUMMARY\nIn summary, we have investigated the effects of CNT\ncomposite films under stress. Results show that the emission\nthreshold fields of these films can be varied by bending the\nsample. Threshold fields as low as 0.6 V\/mm have been ob-\nserved in this work, one of the lowest threshold fields ever\nreported. This work also suggests the possibility of using\nCNT-composite films as an electromechanical switch in high\npower applications.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. K.
