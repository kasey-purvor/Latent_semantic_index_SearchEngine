The\nprocedure does give accurate staging without the extra\nmorbidity of regional node dissection and many patients\ngain psychological support from the information gained.\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS OF SENTINEL LYMPH NODE\nBIOPSY FOR MELANOMA\nExcision of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) enables\na prognostic assessment to be made that is more\npowerful than thickness measurements on the\nprimary.1 2 This in itself is sufficient, to many, to\njustify the procedure since it has low morbidity.3\nThe SLN status is an important criterion for entry\ninto clinical trials and therefore until a clear\neffective systemic therapy is established SLN\nbiopsy (SLNB) will have importance and the SLN\nstatus may be the threshold to entry into a\ntreatment programme.\nThe initial reason for development of SLNB was\nto enable selection of patients more likely to\nreceive benefits from regional node dissection\n(RND). It had already been shown that RND\nwas not effective on unselected patients but in the\nabsence of alternatives the surgical treatment\noption was retained. The SLNB seemed a way of\ndirecting RND to a group of patients more likely to\nbenefit from wide excision of nodes. This remains\nthe usual procedure, although evolution towards\noffering RND to an even more restricted group of\npatients is proceeding. Whether SLNB by itself is of\ntherapeutic benefit is not yet established. There is a\nsuggestion of prolongation of disease-free survival\nfor SLNB patients as compared with observation\nfollowed by RND only when clinical evidence of\nmetastases develops. Prolongation of overall survi-\nval has not yet been demonstrated but longer\nfollow-up may reveal this.2\nPOTENTIAL PROBLEMS OF SLNB\nAny disadvantages of SLNB are also not estab-\nlished. The anxieties about an increase in \u2018\u2018in\ntransit\u2019\u2019 metastases4 5 have not been upheld.6 7 The\ntheoretical concern about removal of what is likely\nto be the first line of immunological defence still\nrequires further study. A suggested alternative\nprocedure is high-grade ultrasound,8 but 4.5 mm\nis the smallest size that can be consistently\ndetected with this technique and the majority of\nmetastases in SLN for melanoma are smaller than\nthat and therefore this alternative does not appear\nacceptable as a substitute for SLNB. The SLNB\nprocedure has some associated morbidity but this\nis much less than for RND, and at least 70% of\npatients with melanoma will avoid this morbidity\nby having the lesser procedure. The National\nInstitute for Health and Clinical Excellence\n(NICE) report on skin tumours9 has concluded\nthat SLNB has merit for staging, and that it should\ncontinue to be done in existing centres as part of\nclinical trials, but has not wholeheartedly recom-\nmended SLNB for all melanoma. This recommen-\ndation is in spite of the current paucity of suitable\ntrials into which to enter patients. The NICE\nadvice may need modification in the light of the\nrecent report of MSLT-1 since some prolongation\nof disease-free survival has been demonstrated2 and\nimproved overall survival cannot be ruled out.\nSURGICAL PROCEDURES EFFECTING\nPATHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT\nThe identification of the SLN by the surgeon\nshould be based on preoperative lymphoscintigra-\nphy and intraoperative injection of vital blue dye\nand radiocolloids. The lymphoscintigraphy demon-\nstrates the direction of the lymph drainage from\nany cutaneous site and enables the first or sentinel\nlymph nodes in each basin to be identified and\nmarked on the overlying skin. There is some\nvariation in definitions of SLN and so there may\nbe variation in the numbers of SLN excised\nbetween surgeons or between centres.\nThe SLN should be excised with a cuff of fat and\nwithout trauma to the node. Examination of the\nsubcapsular zone of the SLN is most likely to reveal\nmetastases and so it is important that this should\nnot be damaged by the surgery.10 Confirmation of\nwhat is a true SLN may be obtained by using\ncarbon dye injected at the primary site. This tends\nto be localised in the area most likely to contain\nmetastases and its presence confirms the node as a\ntrue SLN. Unfortunately this carbon preparation is\nnot available in all countries. Where the surgeon\nsees the afferent lymphatics with the blue dye he\ncan use a ligature to identify this aspect of the node\nso that the pathologist is aware of the orientation\nof the node, and this therefore facilitates the slicing\nthrough the median plane.\nHISTOPATHOLOGICAL AND PATHOBIOLOGICAL\nPECULIARITIES OF MELANOCYTIC TUMOURS\nAFFECTING INTERPRETATION OF SLN\nIn contrast to interpretation of SLN for other\nmalignancies, melanoma presents extra difficulties\ndue to its tendency to metastasise in small groups\nMy approach\nJ Clin Pathol 2008;61:897\u2013902. doi:10.1136\/jcp.2006.042036 897\n group.bmj.com on November 23, 2010 - Published by jcp.bmj.comDownloaded from \nor even single cells, which on conventional H&E staining are\nsimilar to other cells normally present in lymph nodes at least at\nscanning magnification. The assessment of the lymph node\nmust be designed to detect as many as possible of these\nmetastases. To detect all of them would involve serial sectioning\nof the SLN to extinction resulting in thousands of sections per\nnode. This is clearly not practicable and a balance between\nworkload and efficiency is required and several procedures have\nbeen developed.\nPATHOLOGICAL PROCEDURES\nDissection\nDissection of the SLN can be by random parallel \u2018\u2018bread loaf\u2019\u2019\nslicing11 or single slicing through the central plane (bivalve\ntechnique).12\nSince Cochran, in an early study,13 showed that the majority\nof metastases are in a central plane (see fig 1), the bivalve\ntechnique, in which a slice is made through the convex capsule\nand the hilum to reveal the maximum cut surface area, has been\nadopted by us.14 The alternative technique recommended by\nStarz et al11 consists of slicing the SLN at 2 mm intervals. It is\nattractive in that it does not depend on the slightly difficult\nidentification of a central plane and also in that it does not\nrequire multiple sections on each slice. However, in larger nodes,\nthere may be a need for several blocks.\nOn balance we have preferred to use the bivalving approach,\nbut using some dissection of the lymph node from the\nsurrounding fat followed by a combined visual assessment and\npalpation to identify the central plane through which the node\nis bisected.\nSectioning and staining\nFurther options exist in the sectioning and staining of the\nbivalved node. Cochran12 recommended serial sections from the\ntwo mid-plane surfaces stained with a combination of H&E and\nmelanocyte markers (S100, HMB45, Melan A). Starz11 examined\nonly two sections from each block dissected in a different way,\nand used H&E and immunohistochemistry. Both of these\nprocedures detected metastases in 15\u201320% of patients.\nSince immunohistochemistry increases the detection rate of\nmetastases by at least 10%15 we have used it from the beginning.\nThe particular antibody used depends on local preference. We\nhave tried HMB45, MelanA, MiTF and S100. Melan A and\nHMB45 are widely used but they can be criticised as being less\nsensitive; however, on the other hand they have the advantage\nof being more specific. S100 has been chosen as the first-line\nantibody since it is the most sensitive, the least demanding\ntechnically, and the cheapest. However, it does require the\npathologist to gain experience in its interpretation, particularly\nin distinguishing melanocytes from clumps of dendritic cells.\nWe have overcome this rare problem by always having\nunstained adjacent sections for more specific antibodies in\nreserve for use in more problematic cases. We use Melan A most\noften for this confirmatory purpose. We have found HMB45\npositivity in only 70% of melanomas and therefore do not\nregard it as sufficiently sensitive. A cocktail of antibodies\nincluding Melan A, HMB45, S100 and tyrosinase such as Pan\nMel+ (Biocare Medical, Concord, California, USA) has high\nsensitivity and specificity but is more expensive and technically\nmore demanding. With experience, S100 has the highest\nsensitivity and particularly in combination with diaminobenzi-\ndine chromogen even single cells can be identified on screening\nmagnification and confirmed on the adjacent H&E. This enables\ndistinction from other potentially positive cells such as dendritic\ncells and nerves. We assess the same cells on immediately\nadjacent sections stained with H&E. Unless we are convinced\nthat the immunohistochemistry positivity corresponds with a\ncell with cytological features of a melanocyte, we do not regard\nthe SLN as positive.\nMelanophages may sometimes be identified without mela-\nnocytes in the SLN and it could be speculated that these\nfeatures represent intranodal regression, but the melanophages\ncould equally well represent drainage of melanophages from the\nprimary melanoma. These are particularly numerous when the\nprimary melanoma shows features of regression.\nBalancing extended sectioning against reverse transcription-PCR\nIn the early stages of development of SLN pathology protocols,\nthe possibility of using molecular techniques such as reverse\ntranscription (RT)-PCR on fresh tissue instead of histology was\nconsidered. Positivity in SLN for melanoma using tyrosinase and\nor MART-1 or gp100 was found to be much higher than that\nobtained using histology, even up to 72% positive.16 This high\npositivity far exceeded what would be expected from our\nknowledge of the natural history of melanoma unless the\nselection of cases was highly selected in favour of extremely\npoor prognosis patients. However the comparison between\nhistology and molecular techniques was not adequately\ncontrolled, most obviously in that the lymph nodes were\ndivided in an unspecified way and the separate parts assessed by\nonly one of the two techniques. This took no account of the\ndistribution of the metastases in the nodes.\nWe decided that the role of molecular biology needed to be\nevaluated in a more controlled manner,14 and we found that a\npositivity of 45% with RT-PCR on frozen sections did exceed\nwhat was obtained from immediately adjacent sections stained\nconventionally (18% positive), but that the discrepancy could be\nexplained partly by the presence of naevus cells, which would\nalso give a positive RT-PCR result, and partly by the presence of\nfurther melanoma deeper in the node only detected by more\nsections.\nWe achieved a detection rate of 33.8% by extending the\nsectioning protocol to six pairs of sections at 50 mm intervals.\nEach pair was stained with H&E and S100. Other unstained\nspare sections were taken at each 50 mm step. Further levels\nFigure 1 Metastases of melanoma are said to occur close to the\nmedian plane of the sentinel lymph node and therefore bivalving, as\nshown, and embedding face down in the cassette are recommended.\nMy approach\n898 J Clin Pathol 2008;61:897\u2013902. doi:10.1136\/jcp.2006.042036\n group.bmj.com on November 23, 2010 - Published by jcp.bmj.comDownloaded from \ndeeper than the sixth pair produced only a minimal improve-\nment in detection rate and therefore the six pairs at 50 mm\nintervals protocol was adopted by us as a reasonable balance\nbetween workload and sensitivity.14\nThe detection rate of 33.8% was still below 45% detected by\nRT-PCR but this is explained almost entirely by the presence of\nnaevus cells. Others17 have suggested that this protocol is too\nlabour intensive or expensive. More importantly the significance\nof the additional metastases needs to be established.\nWe do not regard the extra work as excessive since in more\nthan 70% of SLN that are negative only seven slides need to be\nexamined per lymph node. This is achieved by using S100 as a\npreliminary stain for scanning and one H&E to rule out other\npathology. In the 30% of cases that are positive, more detailed\nassessment is required. Occasional melanomas are S100 negative\n(1% in our experience), but metastases are still identified easily\nas a negative or clear area against the blue counterstained\nbackground.\nThe only variation in the sectioning protocol occurs when\nlymph nodes are unusually rounded rather than approximately\nreniform. In those thicker lymph nodes we use a wider step\nbetween the pairs of stained sections, increasing it from 50 mm\nto 75 or 100 mm.\nIt may be that the protocol we have adopted14 in the long\nterm may be shown to be excessively rigorous since Van Akkooi\net al18 have shown that metastases ,0.1 mm are not associated\nwith further disease. However we consider that all metastases\nhowever small have yet to be shown not to be capable of\nprogressing to more aggressive disease even after many years.\nWe have some experience of metastases remaining small and\nlocalised in lymph nodes for several years after excision of the\nprimary melanoma. This is presumably the explanation of how\nsome melanoma metastases occasionally progress 10 or more\nyears after excision of the primary. It remains to be shown\nwhether some melanoma metastases are not capable of\nprogression by reason of different biology related to their\ngenetic profile, and therefore at least until that is proved and\nsuch cases are identifiable, detection of as many as possible of\nmetastases should be the aim. This is supported by finding that\nso-called isolated tumour cells in groups less than 0.2 mm are\nassociated with a lower overall survival.27\nAt least for the foreseeable future we recommend the protocol\nas outlined in table 1 using S100 as a screening stain so that the\nprocedure is not too time consuming. RT-PCR is not ideal at\nleast for detection of metastases but work of Hoon et al19 and\nChew et al (unpublished) indicate that it may be useful in\nproviding additional prognostic information.\nNaevus cells in SLN\nOne of the main difficulties in interpretation of SLN is the\npresence of benign naevus cells. These are detected by S100 but\nare almost always negative with HMB45, so that marker can be\nused to distinguish naevus cells from metastatic melanoma.10\nHowever, not all melanomas are positive with HMB45 (70% in\nour experience) so that negativity is not a confirmation of\nbenign nature.\nMore importantly, naevus cells can be distinguished from\nmetastases by their site and cytology. We have assessed the SLN\nfrom 2005 patients with cutaneous melanoma, and 14% of\nthem contained naevus cells mostly in the substance of the\nfibrous capsule but occasionally in the fibrous trabeculae. The\ncells are usually characteristically naevoid with small dense\nnuclei or little cytoplasm. However, very occasionally, collec-\ntions of naevoid cells are quite large so that they appear to\nencroach into the adjacent lymph node. In those cases, while\nnuclei are still highly uniform, nucleoli can become evident. In\nthese rare difficult cases we use HMB45 (as recommended by\nMurray et al10) and MIB1. The HMB45 status is an important\nguide but sometimes a more definite conclusion is achieved with\nMIB1. Naevus cells should show no positivity with this stain,\nbut melanoma would be expected to show at least some positive\nnuclei.\nThe interpretation of MIB1 can be difficult in lymph nodes\nbecause of the high proportion of positivity in surrounding\nlymphocytes. P16 can be used in a similar way being usually\npositive in naevus cells and lost in melanoma.\nWe have identified naevus cells in 279 SLN patients. Sixty-\ntwo (22.2%) of these were associated with melanoma metas-\ntases but the majority (217) were not.\nWHICH PATIENTS SHOULD BE OFFERED SLNB\nThe criteria of the primary melanoma that are used to justify\nperforming SLNB are not standardised but most commonly a\nminimum thickness of 1 mm has been used. Others have\nsuggested that there is no benefit in performing SLNB on\npatients with melanomas thicker than 4 mm since these are\nalready known to have a bad prognosis. However, we would\nargue that a large proportion (40%) of the thick melanomas still\nhave long-term survival and therefore the SLN can be used to\nattempt to identify that particular group. We originally\nconsidered that any patients with a melanoma in vertical\ngrowth phase should be offered SLNB and we did identify\nseveral patients with melanomas less than 1 mm down to\n0.6 mm thickness that had metastasised. Nevertheless, the\nnumber of such cases was a small proportion of the total and\ntherefore began to restrict offering SLNB to patients with\nmelanoma thicker than 1 mm. Gimotty et al20 have suggested\nthat thin melanomas (,1 mm) can be graded in risk according\nto their mitotic counts and the gender of the patient. Males\nwith thin and invasive mitotically active melanomas are said to\nhave a 31% risk of metastasis and females a 13% risk. Therefore\nwe have begun to offer SLNB to patients with thin melanomas\nand dermal mitoses that by definition are in vertical growth\nphase.\nRegression has also long been considered as an important\nfeature of melanomas, with implications of an adverse effect on\nprognosis by some. This effect is not accepted universally and\nthere are roughly equal numbers of studies who regard\nregression as having an unfavourable effect on survival as those\nwho consider it to have no or even a favourable effect.21\nNevertheless prognostic tables22 showed regression as a poor\nprognostic factor and for that reason we did use it as a criterion\nfor offering SLNB.\nOur own studies23 comparing melanoma patients with or\nwithout regression in terms of SLN status, as a surrogate for\nsurvival, showed as one might expect intuitively that regression\nappeared to confer benefit to the patient, therefore we have\ndiscontinued accepting regression as a criterion.\nMorton et al2 have identified some prolongation of disease-\nfree survival with SLNB on melanomas with thickness between\n1.2 and 4 mm but this does not imply that SLNB should only be\noffered to patients with this range of thickness of melanoma\nsince the staging benefits also apply to those outside this group.\nAt this stage we think it appropriate to offer SLNB to all\npatients with melanoma over 1.0 mm in thickness and to those\npatients with thinner invasive melanomas in which mitoses are\nidentified in the dermal component unless there are other\nclinical features that override this decision.\nMy approach\nJ Clin Pathol 2008;61:897\u2013902. doi:10.1136\/jcp.2006.042036 899\n group.bmj.com on November 23, 2010 - Published by jcp.bmj.comDownloaded from \nMULTICENTRE SLN TRIALS\nThe first multicentre SLN trial (MSLT-1) has made a\npreliminary report.2 In 1269 patients, this trial has shown that\nSLNB with immediate RND for positive cases had a 4.8%\nimprovement in disease-free survival compared with no SLNB\nand RND only on clinical evidence of metastasis.\nThe SLN status was confirmed as a potent prognostic factor\nin that positive nodes conferred a 5-year survival rate of 72.3%\non the patients compared with 90.2% in patients with negative\nSLN. No overall survival benefit was noted at 5-year follow-up.\nThis does not exclude the possibility of survival advantage being\ndemonstrated after longer follow-up since metastases from\nthinner melanomas tend to occur later if at all.\nThe second multicentre SLN trial (MSLT-2) proposes to\nevaluate whether it is necessary to proceed to RND in all\npatients with positive SLN irrespective of the tumour burden,\nand also to further examine the role of RT-PCR positivity in\nhistologically negative SLN. Some cases that are histologically\nnegative but positive on RT-PCR will still enter the trial.\nThe Sunbelt melanoma trial, which is another multicentre\nstudy,24 emphasises the prognostic and staging value of SLNB\nhistology and also proposes to evaluate the role of RT-PCR in\nassessment of SLN, but has not yet concluded its study. It has\nreported a definition of SLN based on the ratio of radioactivity\nin a node to that in the background. The latter should be 10% or\nless of that in the SLN.\nThe Sunbelt trial has not identified factors in the SLN\nmetastases that enable prediction of metastases elsewhere and\ntherefore they advocate completion lymphadenectomy for every\npatient with a positive SLN. They have noted a lower rate of\nmetastases to SLN in older patients despite the shorter survival\nin the same group, suggesting that the biology of melanomas of\nyounger patients is often different from that of older patients,\nwith the latter showing greater tendency to haematogenous\nmetastases.\nThis is supported by the findings of Viros et al 25 in which\npatients under 55 years were much more likely to have\nmelanomas with BRAF mutation than older patients. This\nsupports the growing support for the idea that melanoma is not\none diagnosis but a collection of melanocytic tumours with\ndifferent behaviours.\nA FUTURE ROLE FOR RT-PCR\nThe MSLT-2 proposals have been stimulated in part by the\nobservations of further RT-PCR studies19 that indicate that RT-\nPCR positive, histologically negative SLN have a worse\nprognosis than those that are negative by both techniques.\nOur recent studies (unpublished) also suggest that nodal\nmetastases detected by melanoma-specific markers such as\nMAGE-3 revealed by RT-PCR on paraffin-embedded tissue from\nSLN gives an added dimension to the prognosis beyond that\nwhich can be obtained with histology alone. However the\nprocess is laborious, therefore potentially expensive, and only\ndissects out an additional group of poorer prognosis patients\nfrom those 70% or so who are negative by histology. Rather\nthan perform this additional assessment on the whole 70% of\nSLN that are negative, there is a need for a way of focussing on\nthose within that group who are more likely to be positive. This\nwould make this procedure more likely to be acceptable. For\nexample, perhaps RT-PCR would be predictably negative in\nSLN-negative patients who were thinner than say 1.2 mm and\nhad no mitoses in the dermis, or were of a histological type with\nsuspected better prognosis such as spindle cell melanomas, or\nhad a diffuse and intense tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte\nresponse.\nConversely SLN-negative cases that are histologically nega-\ntive, but have a high mitotic count, would be expected to be\nmore likely to be positive with RT-PCR.\nIMPROVEMENT OF PREDICTIVE ACCURACY OF HISTOLOGICAL\nASSESSMENT OF SLN ACCORDING TO \u2018\u2018TUMOUR BURDEN\u2019\u2019\nA straightforward record of presence or absence of metastases in\nSLN has great prognostic value,1 but several authors have\nconsidered whether specific features of the metastases or their\ndistribution may give more precise prognostic information.\nStarz et al11 described an index derived from the depth of the\nmetastases from the capsule and the number of slices involved.\nThis index enabled a prediction of the status of the rest of the\nlymph nodes in the same basin to be made with considerable\naccuracy. Cochran12 was able to provide increased accuracy of\nsurvival prediction by using a relative tumour area calculation,\nbased on some computer-facilitated measurement and calcula-\ntions.\nOur group26 noted a correlation between the microanatomic\ndistribution of the metastases in the SLNB and the presence of\nadditional metastases in the RND. Those patients in whom the\nmetastases were entirely subcapsular (fig 2) were found not to\nhave any metastases in the nodes of the subsequent RND. The\nsubcapsular pattern was seen in approximately 30% of all\npositive SLN. More recently Van Akkooi et al18 showed that\nmetastases ,0.1 mm in maximum dimension, irrespective of\nsite, were not associated with further metastases or any\nevidence of tumour progression. Govindarajan et al27 supported\nsimilar findings in noting that patients with metastases\n,0.2 mm maximum dimension did not have positivity in their\nRND. There have been no recurrences in this group although\nTable 1 Sequence of sectioning and staining for sentinel\nlymph node for melanoma\nSection Treatment\nSection 1 (first full section) H&E\nSection 2 S100\nSection 3 Spare\n50 mm gap (+50 mm)\nSection 4 H&E\nSection 5 S100\nSection 6 Spare\nSection 7 Spare\nSection 8 Spare\nSection 9 Spare\n50 mm gap (+100 mm)\nSection 10 H&E\nSection 11 S100\nSection 12 Spare\n50 mm gap (+150 mm)\nSection 13 H&E\nSection 14 S100\nSection 15 Spare\n50 mm gap (+200 mm)\nSection 16 H&E\nSection 17 S100\nSection 18 Spare\n50 mm gap (+250 mm)\nSection 19 H&E\nSection 20 S100\nIn large or round lymph nodes, the 50 mm gap may be increased up\nto a maximum of 100 mm.\nMy approach\n900 J Clin Pathol 2008;61:897\u2013902. doi:10.1136\/jcp.2006.042036\n group.bmj.com on November 23, 2010 - Published by jcp.bmj.comDownloaded from \nthe follow-up period was short. These findings require further\nstudy as the number of such cases that were not subcapsular\nwas very small. In addition28 Scheri et al have noted that\nmetastases ,0.2 mm in maximum dimension have a signifi-\ncantly higher risk of melanoma-specific death than SLN-\nnegative patients thereby questioning the assumption that\nsmall metastases have limited significance.\nThese assessments of tumour burden all have merits, but\nwhether one is more accurate or appropriate than another is not\nfinally decided. All of them depend on careful examination of all\navailable sections since metastases are not necessarily present in\nall.10 The Starz technique is perhaps most simple to assess being\na measure from the capsule to the deepest metastasis. However\none could ask from which part of the capsule does one measure.\nLogically it should be from the afferent aspect, but this is not\nalways obvious.\nVan Akkooi et al recommends the maximum dimensions of\nthe largest deposit; this sounds straightforward but it needs to\nbe understood that they mean the largest cohesive groups of\ncells, even though that may be only one of many, each of them\nshowing only slight separation from each other.\nThe location of the metastases in our hands gives more\nreliable information, very easily assessed, in that subcapsular\nmetastases are only very rarely associated with metastases in\nthe rest of the nodes in the same basin. Even so, the definition of\nsubcapsular site needs to be considered carefully. Subcapsular\nsinuses are not clearly visible and metastases in that zone are\nnot usually identifiable as in a lumen. Their subcapsular zone\nlocation is important, with the configuration of the deposit\nbeing reasonably smooth, that is with no irregular projections\non the parenchymal aspect.\nOn the basis of these studies it seems reasonable to presume\nthat prognosis based on SLN can be refined, and that low\nvolume, small or subcapsular metastases may not need to be\nfollowed by RND, although the criteria accepted may require\nfurther refinement. Whether these small or subcapsular\nmetastases are precursors to larger tumours or represent a\ndifferent character of metastases with more indolent growth\nproperties remains to be established. It seems likely to us that\nthey represent a mixture of early but potentially aggressive\nmetastases with some more indolent ones.\nIn the meantime the European Organization for Research and\nTreatment of Cancer (EORTC) has suggested a clinical trial of\nmelanoma patients with SLN metastases confined to the\nsubcapsular zone or less than 0.1 mm in maximum dimension\nirrespective of site. These will be followed by observation for\n5 years in the first instance. If these metastases are not\nassociated with further disease then there would be some\nvalidation of a more selective approach to RND. It would also\nput more pressure on pathologists to assess the SLNB in greater\ndetail. At the moment these assessments are performed only as\npart of studies or trials, but virtually all patients having SLNB\nare in that category since the procedure is to a large extent still\nbeing evaluated.\nSUMMARY: PART 1\nProposals for SLN assessment\nOn the basis of our work and other published work we suggest\nthat SLN for melanoma should be bivalved according to\nCochran\u2019s method. The resulting paraffin-embedded blocks\nshould be sectioned in our opinion in a stepwise manner.\nWe currently use 50 mm steps producing six pairs of sections\nto an approximate total depth of 0.3\u20130.4 mm. There is an\nargument to make the steps wider or less numerous,29 but\nbearing in mind the small size of many metastases and our lack\nof certainty on the critical dimension of the metastases we feel\nthis change in protocol needs to be done in a systematic way.\nVan Akkooi et al18 suggest metastases ,0.1 mm diameter can be\nignored. The EORTC observation study, in part, is intended to\nvalidate that observation and therefore we will continue with\nthe existing EORTC protocol of six pairs of sections at 50 mm\nintervals at least until that study reports.\nWe have strongly recommended the need for immunohisto-\nchemistry in the assessment partly because the detection rate is\nthen higher and partly because the recognition of metastases is\nmuch facilitated, making the pathologist\u2019s task less onerous.\nWhether S100 or Melan A is used is a matter of personal choice.\nIt is wise to retain some unstained sections at each level for\nproblematic cases.\nThe features that should be recorded are not only the\npresence of metastases but their site and size.\nA metastasis in a subcapsular site but with a markedly\nirregular aspect towards the parenchyma or single cells breaking\naway from the main metastasis should not be regarded as being\nentirely subcapsular in site.\nOther measurements on which further refinements of\nmanagement may be based are the depth of the metastasis\nfrom the capsule to its deepest point, and the maximum\ndimension of the largest deposit. Van Akkooi et al18 have\nsuggested that this last dimension should be applied only to\ncohesive groups of cells rather than looser aggregates. Groups of\n10 cells or less are already regarded by that group as negative.\nOthers are taking a more cautious line and would prefer to\nawait the results of more studies on this point. Since, at least in\nthe UK, the SLNB procedure is not regarded as standard, and in\nall countries is being carefully evaluated, it is not suggested that\nthe pathological assessments should simply be loaded onto\npathology departments without careful consideration of the\nlabour or cost implications. Furthermore, it is important that\ncommitted pathologists are involved in the reporting of SLN to\nensure the reproductibility of the detailed assessments currently\nbeing undertaken in multicentre trials.\nFigure 2 Screening of sentinel lymph node stained with S100\nfacilitates identification of metastatic melanoma. Distinction from\ndendritic cells, seen lower left, is made on the basis of cytology, with the\ndendritic cells having a poorly defined outline and smaller nuclei. The\nH&E-stained adjacent section enables confirmation of the cytological\nfeatures and the site of the metastasis\u2014in this case subcapsular.\nMy approach\nJ Clin Pathol 2008;61:897\u2013902. doi:10.1136\/jcp.2006.042036 901\n group.bmj.com on November 23, 2010 - Published by jcp.bmj.comDownloaded from \nWe accept that SLNB for melanoma is in a phase of\nassessment and therefore we believe that the criteria we have\nset out and any new criteria need to be evaluated critically\nbefore discarding or adopting them formally as recommenda-\ntions for general application.\nSUMMARY: PART 2\nProbable further developments\nA lower threshold thickness of the primary melanoma for entry\nto SLNB could be considered as well as greater reliance on\nmitotic activity, particularly in males, and perhaps in due course\non genetic profile. Since currently at least 70% of patients\nhaving SLNB have negative results, a greater focus on those who\nare more likely to be positive is predicted. This may be achieved\nby changes to the criteria of the primary melanoma used to\njustify performing SLNB.\nIt is also possible that RND will be offered to only those\npatients with metastases involving a parenchymal site or above\na certain size.\nThere is some curiosity that some patients (30%) with\nhistologically negative SLNB nevertheless still develop recurrent\ndisease and have a poor prognosis. Molecular studies may play a\nrole at this point. Attempts will be made to predict who these\npatients are, using more specific markers.\nIf RT-PCR is adequately validated it is possible that the\nprotocol for sectioning and staining could become less extensive.\nIt seems likely that the need for S100 or Melan A will persist.\nOther assessments may be needed since it is clear that the\nstatus of the immunological reaction to the metastases in the\nlymph node may be useful information when deciding upon\nimmunologically mediated therapy. Dendritic cells are one\ncomponent of this reaction that have been shown to correlate\nwith survival.30 Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)22 in the\nprimary melanoma have prognostic significance in some studies.\nTIL in metastases may have a similar significance.\nIrrespective of the controversy that SLNB seems to provoke it\nhas stimulated much interesting analysis of the biological\nprocesses involved in metastasis, some of which may result in\nmore beneficial therapy for the patients than the SLNB itself,\nand therefore it is likely to remain an important part of the\nmanagement of melanoma patients for many years. It provides\na major opportunity for pathologists to play a pivotal role in\nmelanoma research and management.\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nREFERENCES\n1.
