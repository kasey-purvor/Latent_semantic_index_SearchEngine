Cyclic voltammetry in Fe(CN)63- solutions yields \nthree separate pairs of faradaic peaks.

Introduction \n \nElectrode modification has been widely employed to optimise the performance of many \nelectrochemical analyses1-3, with potential benefits including enhanced selectivity4, stability5 \nand sensitivity6. Chemically Modified Electrodes (CMEs) in particular have been used to \nfacilitate electron transfer reactions7 and the preferential accumulation of analytes at \nelectrode surfaces8. A variety of coatings have been used in this context with common \nexamples including conducting polymers9, ion-exchange polymers (viz. Nafion\u00ae)10 and \nmetallic complex films such as the bipyridine complexes11. CMEs have already been \npreviously reviewed elsewhere12-13. \n \nCalix[4]resorcinarenes form a family of resorcinol\/aldehyde oligomers linked in macrocyclic \narrays by alkylene bridges14-15, and may be synthesised by acid-promoted condensation of \nresorcinols with aldehydes16. The term calixarene first appeared in print in 197817, and is \nderived from the Greek calix meaning \u2018vase\u2019 or \u2018chalice\u2019 with the arene adjunct indicating \nthe presence of aryl residues in the macrocyclic array14. Among their properties, calixarenes \nallow for the preferential uptake of ions from solution and may be used to coat, and thereby \nmodify electrode surfaces18. Structural and functional group modification of a calixarene, \noffers the prospect of tailor designing molecules suitable for use as selective electrode \ncoatings for molecular or ionic analytes of differing radii, charge and even chirality14. A \nvariety of regimes might be possible here; for example a polymeric calixarene ester has been \nused as an electrode modifier for the voltammetric analysis of lead (\u0399\u0399), copper (\u0399\u0399) and \nmercury (\u0399\u0399) ions18, while a commercially available calix[4]resorcinarene, \nC-undecylcalix[4]resorcinarene, (Fluka Chemicals, Gillingham, England, UK.) has also been \nshown to be capable of imparting high selectivity for the amperometric detection of \n 3\nneurotransmitters such as dopamine and epinephrine19. Further examples include calixarene \nderivatives that have been used within potentiometric ion-selective electrodes20, chemically \nsensing field effect transistors (CHEMFET\u2019s)21 and gaseous sensors22. \n \nCalix[4]resorcinarenetetrathiols linked to gold, reside with the bowl pointing away from the \nmetal surface, and have been found to show varying selectivities towards the adsorption of \nspecific solutes, such as Vitamin C and glutaric acid23. Coatings of this type have also been \nshown24 to spontaneously self-assemble to form multilayers via a previously unreported van \nder Waals inter-digitation - hydrogen-bonding alternation process, as opposed to the better \ndocumented covalent, covalent - co-ordinate, covalent - ionic and hydrogen-bonding \nmechanisms25. SPR measurements have been made by other authors26 on an identical \ncompound and have shown that the calix[4]resorcinarenetetrathiol forms good quality \nmonolayers with a thickness of about 21 \u00c5, consistent with an array of well packed vertically \norientated molecules. Alkyl-substituted calix[4]resorcinarenes have been shown to give \nthinner, less well-ordered layers26. The electrochemistry for ferricyanide at these substituted \ncalix[4]resorcinarene coated electrodes has been previously reported27. \n \nThis paper reports on the electrochemical behaviour of the ferri\/ferrocyanide couple at a \ncalix[4]resorcinarenetetrathiol coated gold electrode; the electrochemistry of the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene modified electrode is discussed with respect to the approach trajectory \nof the Fe(CN)63- ion and the possible charge transfer mechanisms by which it is (a) first \nreduced to Fe(CN)64-, and then (b) re-oxidised back to the ferricyanide ion. This work is \nfocussed towards characterising the electrochemical properties of such coatings for their \npossible exploitation within electrochemical sensors.  \n 4\n2. Experimental \n \n2.1 Electrochemical Apparatus \n \nAll experiments were conducted with a purpose designed cell, Fig. 1. The Ag\/AgCl \nreference, Au counter and working electrodes were all mounted within \u2018Suba-Seal\u2019 rubber \nsepta and placed so that they were suspended within the cell. A side-arm water-filled air lock \nprevented the ingress of air, whilst a gas bubbler permitted de-oxygenation of the cell\u2019s \ncontents. \n \nMeasurements were performed using an \u2018Eco Chemie PGSTAT20 Autolab\u2019 potentiostat, \nlinked via an IEEE interface to a Dell PC. \n \n2.2 Reagents and Solutions \n \nA 1 x 10-3 M solution of K3Fe(CN)6 (A.C.S. grade, Aldrich Chemical Co., Gillingham, \nEngland, UK.) was prepared in a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer supporting electrolyte, consisting \nof 5.28 x 10-2 M Na2HPO4 and 1.30 x 10-2 M NaH2PO4 (both of \u2018AnalaR\u2019 grade, B.D.H. Ltd., \nPoole, England, UK.) in doubly distilled de-ionised water together with 0.1 M KCl as a \nsupporting electrolyte. Calix[4]resorcinarenetetrathiol  (structure in Fig. 2), was prepared as \npreviously reported23. Solutions (0.25 mmol dm-3) of the calix[4]resorcinarene were prepared \nin a 9:1 v:v EtOH-DMSO mixture for the coating of the gold electrodes. \n \n 5\n2.3 Electrode Preparation \n \nA custom made Ag\/AgCl reference electrode of 1.5mm diameter was fabricated by sealing a \nlength of silver wire within a hollow soda glass tube, to leave approximately 15 mm exposed \nmetal. The electrode was pre-anodised for 10 mins in a saturated KCl solution at +1.0 V (vs. \nStandard Calomel Electrode) to form an Ag\/AgCl interface. The counter electrode was \nconstructed using a similar technique, but with gold wire of 0.5mm diameter consisting of a \ncoiled length of metal to provide a large surface area. \n \nThe calix[4]resorcinarene-coated gold electrodes were prepared by first evaporating a 50 \u00c5 \nlayer of Cr, followed by 500 \u00c5 of Au onto a clean glass slide. Wires were attached using \n\u2018Electrolube\u2019 silver paint which was subsequently coated with epoxy resin to both insulate \nthe electrical junction and provide additional mechanical strength to the junction. The final \ngeometric area of the electrode was ~4cm2. In this study, slides were placed in the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene solution overnight and then washed thoroughly with clean ethanol. The \nformation and reproducibility of gold-thiol linked calix[4]resorcinarene monolayers was \nverified by grazing angle reflection FTIR spectroscopy, as a quality control procedure25. \n \n2.4 Cell Preparation \n \nPrior to each measurement, all glassware was cleaned in chromic acid (25g K2Cr2O7 \/ 500ml \nH2SO4 - Fisons, Loughborough, England, UK.) for 1 hour and then rinsed thoroughly with \ndoubly distilled de-ionised water. After being allowed to dry in air, the cell was assembled \nand 100ml of the prepared K3Fe(CN)6 solution was placed in the cell. The reference, counter \nand working electrodes were then all fixed in \u2018Suba-Seal\u2019 rubber septa and mounted into the \n 6\ncell. The cell was purged with argon for 20mins to remove any dissolved oxygen whilst \nagitating the cell contents. \n \n2.5 FTIR Analysis \n \nFTIR spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer 1725 X spectrometer fitted with a Harrick \nFT80 reflection accessory and a MCT detector. The samples used for grazing incidence were \ncalix[4]resorcinarene-thiol monolayers adsorbed on a 500 \u00c5 Au film which had been sputter \ncoated on top of a 50 \u00c5 Cr-coated glass slide. Spectra were recorded for the samples before \nand after 1 hr exposure to a 1 mM aqueous K3FeCN6 solution. The IR spectrum of K3FeCN6 \nwas measured within a disc of ground KBr. \n 7\n3 Results and Discussion \n3.1 Voltammetry of Fe (III)(CN)6 3- \/4- couple at Au-calix[4]resorcinarene modified \nelectrodes. \nCyclic voltammograms were recorded at a calix[4]resorcinarene modified electrode in a pH \n7.4 phosphate buffer (0.1M KCl) and at a potential scan rate of 20mVs-1, Fig. 3. The \nvoltammograms are clearly devoid of any faradaic peaks; it may therefore be assumed that at \nleast within the +0.8V to -0.8V (vs. Ag\/AgCl) potential window, the calix[4]resorcinarene \ndisplays no electrochemical redox activity of its own. \n \nThe ferri\/ferrocyanide couple provides an ideal electrochemical probe for the study of \nchemically modified surfaces, since its reduction and oxidation both proceed via simple one \nelectron transfer redox processes, Eqn. 1: \n \nEqn 1:                        Fe (III)(CN)6 3-  Fe (II)(CN)6 4-\nCyclic voltammograms were therefore recorded for the ferri\/ferrocyanide couple at (a) a \ncalix[4]resorcinarene coated electrode, and (b) at a plain gold electrode for comparison, Fig. \n4. For a diffusion controlled reversible reaction at a planar electrode surface, reversible redox \npeaks would be expected to show a 59\/n mV separation (where in this case n=1 corresponds \nto a one electron transfer)28. However as we have shown previously gold-sputtered electrodes \nof the type we are using offer faster electrode kinetics than polished planar gold electrodes \ndue to their crystalline, granular structure and so induce some irreversibility to the behaviour \nobserved with some redox reactions29. Electrodes of this type were used in this study since \nthey provide an ideal surface for the thiol-linked anchorage of calix[4]resorcinarenes24. \n 8\n3.2 Identification of Redox Peaks \nFrom Fig. 4, it is immediately obvious that the single pair of ferri\/ferrocyanide redox peaks \nfor the bare gold electrode transmute into three separate and discernible pairs of peaks at a \ncalix[4]resorcinarene modified gold electrode surface. It is clear here that a one electron \nreduction\/oxidation couple may not be further differentiated into simpler component steps, \nand that the presence of three redox peak pairs must therefore correspond to three separate \nreduction\/oxidation processes for each of the redox couples. The redox peaks were matched \nby running voltammograms over smaller potential windows. Voltammograms between \n+800mV through to +250mV vs Ag\/AgCl exhibited only one redox pair of peaks, Fig 5, \nwhich allowed the identification of the \u03b2 redox couple. Voltammograms between +800mV \nthrough to -200mV vs Ag\/AgCl, Fig 6, allowed the identification of the \u03b1 redox couple. The \n\u03b3 redox peaks were then assigned by deduction as denoted within Fig 4. It should also be \nnoted that each of the three pairs of peaks obtained for the calix[4]resorcinarene coated \nelectrode are smaller than the original peaks seen for the plain gold electrode. For clarity the \nferri\/ferrocyanide redox potentials at the bare gold electrode are compared with those for the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene coated electrodes; (table 1).  \n \nThese results differ from those reported previously for alkyl-substituted calix[4]resorcinarene \nwhich gave much simpler single peaks27. However it should be noted that the \nvoltammograms shown in this paper were for calix[4]resorcinarenes which had been \nsubstituted at the hydroxy group. This would greatly alter the binding of these materials as it \nwould be impossible for them to act as hydrogen bond donors and may also alter their \nconformation as substituted calix[4]resorcinarenes often display mobile structures in solution \nrather than a fixed cone conformation27. Calix[4]resorcinarenes in that work with compact \nheadgroups tended to block the electron transfer reaction. Several materials with bulkier \n 9\nheadgroups showed presence of pinhole defects, shown by oxidation\/reduction cycles close \nto that of a bare gold electrode.  The authors also report that the alkyl-substituted \ncalix[4]resorcinarene with unreacted hydroxy groups forms monolayers with surface defects \n(voltammogram not shown), confirming SPR studies26. \n \n3.3. Steric Effects in the Fe (III)(CN)6 3-\/4-\/ Au-calix[4]resorcinarene electrode system. \nIf three separate redox processes are occurring, then it is probable that these each correspond \nto location of the Fe (CN)63- ion in three different environments. \n \nSeveral interesting points should be noted: The first and most interesting observation relates \nto the (\u03b2(RED)) and (\u03b2(OX)) redox couple. These peaks are nearly coincident in potential, \npointing first towards their match (which may be further verified by comparing their \nintegrated charge values), and second towards a surface bound redox process. Variation of \nthe potential sweep rate from 5 through to 50 mV s-1 also yielded peaks coincident in \npotential providing further confirmation that this redox couple corresponds to a surface-based \nprocess. (\u03b2(OX)) is at a lower overpotential relative to the single ferricyanide reduction \npotentials observed at the bare Au electrode. Two scenarios could possibly explain this \nbehaviour; the first explanation could involve the Fe(CN)63- approaching the gold surface in a \nmore favourable position for the electrochemical charge transfer to occur relative to the bare \ngold electrode surface; the second could possibly indicate a facilitated electron transport, \nwith the calix[4]resorcinarene within this context performing the role of a charge transfer \nmediator between the ferricyanide ion and the gold surface. The most obvious charge transfer \nmechanism here could involve the approach and possible retention of the Fe(CN)63- ion \ndirectly into the bowl of the calix[4]resorcinarene. An ion residing within the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene bowl could clearly explain the observation of a surface bound \n 10\nelectrochemical reaction. Estimates within the literature for the ionic diameter for Fe(CN)63- \nrange from 6.2\u00c530 through to 7.2\u00c531, while the calix[4]resorcinarene has a bowl diameter \nwhich may be calculated to be of approximately 13.2\u00c5, which should therefore should permit \neasy access. Even if we take the shortest Oxygen-Oxygen distance around the perimeter of \nthe bowl (~10\u00c5) - the ferricyanide should be able to enter and reside within the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene structure.  \n \nIt should be remembered in this context that the ion\/calix[4]resorcinarene interactions will \noccur via hydrogen bonding between the oxygen atoms around the perimeter of the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene bowl and the ion, and that the bowl itself will, by its structure, possess \nsome flexibility. It therefore follows that it should be possible for ions to reside in the \nperimeter of the calix[4]resorcinarene bowl without having to enter the cavity of the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene itself.  \n \nIf a Fe(CN)63- ion does reside within the calix[4]resorcinarene bowl, it might be expected to \nbe held at a distance of between 18 and 21\u00c5 from the Au surface, as calculated by \ngeometrical modelling and comparison with SPR results26. One possibility here could be that \nthe Fe(CN)63- might pass through the calix[4]resorcinarene molecule and directly access the \nAu surface; steric hindrance would however make such an approach highly unlikely since the \ndiameter at the base of the calix[4]resorcinarene bowl is calculated to be approximately 5.2\u00c5, \nwhilst the diameter of the ferricyanide ion (7.2\u00c5) is at least 1-2\u00c5 than the passage through \nwhich it would have to pass. It appears clear therefore, that the ferricyanide ion must here be \nheld at some distance in excess of 14\u00c5 from the Au surface as its plane of closest approach. \n  \n 11\nA simple consideration of the Marcus28 or Intersecting State theories32 for charge transfer \nmechanisms shows that molecular or ionic coupling - and therefore electron transfer rates \ndecrease exponentially with distance, Eqn. 2:- \n \nEqn 2:    VR2 = VO2 exp (-\u03b2R) \n \nwhere Vo2 represents the maximum electric coupling, R is the distance and \u03b2 is the \nexponential electron tunnelling coefficient.  \n \nIndeed, variations of 20\u00c5 have been shown to change electron transfer rates by as much as \n1012 fold33. \n \nIt should be remembered that the empirical results of Fig. 4, show a facilitation in the \nelectron transfer process and so suggest that the ferricyanide is being held in a favourable \nsteric environment and that charge transfer species (eg H+ or even OH- ions) permit transfer \nbetween the environment of the calix[4]resorcinarene bowl and the gold surface. It should not \nbe forgotten that the calix[4]resorcinarene molecule is immobilised on the gold surface via \nthiol linkages. While insulating proteins typically show an electron tunnelling coefficient of \n1.4\u00c5-1 33, \u03b2 values for Au-thiol linked saturated hydrocarbons have been reported as low as \n0.98\u00c5-1 34, showing that charge transfer of this nature may occur far more easily than was \npreviously thought possible. \n \nIf a Fe(CN)63- ion resides within the calix[4]resorcinarene bowl, the components of the \ncomplex must undergo electronic orbital coupling with each other; although data for the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene\/Fe(CN)63- interaction is not available, it would appear that the \n 12\nentrapment of ferricyanide ion enhances electronic coupling which facilitates electron \ntransport to the electrode via the thiol-linked\/calix[4]resorcinarene structure. The overall \nlowering of the activation barrier, may however be calculated from the change in reduction \npotential, calculated from Eqn. 3:- \n \nEqn 3:    \u2206E = nF (\u03b1RED - \u03b2RED) \n \nwhere F = Faraday Constant and n = no. of electrons involved in reaction. \n \nIn this instance, the activation energy for the reduction of Fe(CN)63- has been found to be \nlowered by approximately 24kJ mol-1. Possible interactions include hydrogen bonding of the \nphenolic groups to the negatively charged ferricyanide ions and interactions of the ion with \nthe electron rich aromatic groups. Should the more electron rich FeII(CN)64- interact more \nstrongly than FeIII(CN)63-, this would cause a net stabilisation of the ferrocyanide and make \nthe reduction of ferricaynide more energetically favourable. \n \nThe next pair of peaks to be considered are those denoted as \u03b1(RED) and \u03b1(OX) respectively. \nThe \u03b1(RED) now occurs at a more negative overpotential (approximately -25mV vs Ag\/AgCl) \nindicating a slightly less favourable environment with respect to the bare gold surface. In this \ninstance the activation energy is calculated to have increased by approximately 10kJ mol-1. \nThe corresponding re-oxidation peak \u03b1(OX), moreover exhibits some loss in reversibility again \nindicating a less favourable environment for the re-oxidation of the Fe(CN)64- ion with \nrespect to the bare gold electrode surface. \n \n 13\nIt is possible in this situation that the Fe(CN)63- ion approaches the gold electrode by \nmigration under the influence of electric field, but encounters considerable steric hindrance \nfrom adsorbed Fe(CN)63- as it is pulled against the calix[4]resorcinarene layer. It is known \nthat direct contact may not be necessary to permit efficient electron transport33. The \nferricyanide ions are held against the layer but not immobilised inside the bowls. The absence \nof any smaller shoulder peaks on the (\u03b1(RED)) peak suggests that the ferricyanide ion is being \nprevented from directly accessing the gold electrode surface which in turn would point \ntowards a complete and homogeneous calix[4]resorcinarene coating at the Au electrode \nsurface which is consistent with SPR results26.  \n \nIn this model one pair of redox peaks (\u03b3(RED) and \u03b3(OX)) has still to be accounted for. A third \nenvironment for the approach of the Fe (CN)63- ion could involve a stacking of Fe (CN)63- \nions above a layer of Fe (CN)63- filled calix[4]resorcinarene cavities; this is indeed probable \nas the ferricyanide will be drawn to the surface of the gold electrode during the cathodic \nsweep. Once the calix[4]resorcinarene cavities are filled, the closest possible approach of the \nFe(CN)63- ion to the electrode will be in excess of 21\u00c5.  \n \nIt is therefore proposed that (\u03b3(RED) and \u03b3(OX)) may correspond to the reduction of Fe(CN)63- \nand the subsequent oxidation of Fe(CN)64- respectively when the ion is held above the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene coating. An increased reduction overpotential of approximately 320mV \n(table 1), shows that the activation energy for this process has been increased by ~45kJ mol-1. \nIf the process has become less favourable energetically, then electronic coupling of the \nFe(CN)63- ion with either the calix[4]resorcinarene or gold surface must also have been \nimpaired and this may indeed be probable if the ions are situated some distance from either \nthe calix[4]resorcinarene structure - or indeed the Au surface. \n 14\n This model for the reduction of Fe(CN)63- ions of three environments could account for all of \nthe considerations thus far. It has been established for some time that ions do indeed reside \nwithin that calix[4]resorcinarene bowl24, and it is probable that the electrical migration of \nions towards the Au surface will cause further ions to be firstly pulled in between and then \nstacked above the individual calix[4]resorcinarene molecules; an electrical double layer type \narrangement of ion association around the electrode might be envisaged here. \n \nTo summarise it is therefore that the three observed pairs of redox peaks observed \nrespectively correspond to the electron transfer processes of ferricyanide ions residing: \n \n(i) directly within the calix[4]resorcinarene bowl (\u03b1(RED) & \u03b1(OX)); and \n(ii) against the  calix[4]resorcinarene layer, (\u03b2(OX) &  \u03b2(RED)), \n(iii) stacked above the calix[4]resorcinarene layer (\u03b3(RED) & \u03b3(OX)). \n \n3.4 IR Spectroscopy of the Fe(III)(CN)6 3- \/4-  couple on the Au-calix[4]resorcinarene \nsurface. \nFurther supporting evidence for this model was found by infra-red spectroscopy of a \ncalix[4]resorcinarene coated Au surface, a calix[4]resorcinarene coated Au surface which has \nbeen exposed to Fe(CN)63- and the Fe(CN)63- complex. The spectra of the \nAu\/calix[4]resorcinarene and Au\/calix[4]resorcinarene\/Fe(CN)63- surfaces were obtained \nusing FTIR spectroscopy; the infra-red spectrum of the Fe(CN)63- was measured within a \nground and compressed KBr disc, Fig 7. The Fe(CN)63- spectrum displays a pronounced peak \nat ~2135 cm-1, Fig 7a (not to scale with a and b). Two discernible peaks are seen for the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene\/ferricyanide coating at ~2115 and 2086 cm-1, Fig 7b, which might \n 15\ncorrespond to the Fe(CN)63- residing between adjacent calix[4]resorcinarene molecules and \nwithin the calix[4]resorcinarene bowl respectively.  Alternatively they could arise because of \nthe difference between axial and equatorial cyano groups in an immobilised ion. The peaks \nare noticeably broader and of lower wavenumber than in the solid, indicating the presence of \na pronounced interaction with the calix[4]resorcinarene, however due to the almost spherical \nsymmetry of the ferricyanide ion, no orientation data can be found. As a control the FTIR \nspectrum of the calix[4]resorcinarene layer on its own was measured and shows no \ndistinguishable peaks within the range studied, Fig 7c.  \n \n3.5 Stability of the Fe (III)(CN)6 3- \/4- calix[4]resorcinarene-Au association. \nIt is known that ion-calix[4]resorcinarene associations may remain stable for some time24, the \nstability of the association between the ferricyanide and the calix[4]resorcinarene coatings \nwas therefore evaluated electrochemically. Electrodes which had already been \nvoltammetrically scanned in a Fe(CN)63-\/ phosphate buffer solution were immersed and then \nrepeatedly voltammetrically scanned within a plain phosphate buffer, Fig. 8. The magnitudes \nof the ferri\/ferrocyanide faradaic peaks clearly diminish with each sweep. This may be \nexplained in terms of loss of ferricyanide with time and successive potential sweeping. Only \none discernible oxidation peak on the anodic sweep (which itself diminishes with each \nsuccessive cycle) is observed. The position for this peak is also curious (~ -0.05 to -0.15 V vs \nAg\/AgCl), since this is considerably less anodic than each of the \u03b1(OX), \u03b2(OX) or \u03b3(OX) peaks. It \nis believed that when the electrode is placed in fresh buffer, loosely associated ferricyanide \nions, in positions other than the calix[4]resorcinarene bowl, are lost under the action of a \ndiffusion gradient. The packing arrangement once disrupted may also possibly perturb the \nFe(CN)63-\/calix[4]resorcinarene bowl association, which in turn may give rise to an altered \noxidation potential, Fig 8. \n 16\n Even more interestingly however, it became apparent that the Au surface is progressively lost \nfrom the glass backing support of the electrode with each successive potential sweep, Fig. 9. \nBy contrast, a calix[4]resorcinarene coated gold electrode that has never been exposed to \nferricyanide, remains stable indefinitely, when voltammetrically scanned in the same \nphosphate buffer. A plain gold electrode also remains indefinitely stable when \nvoltammetrically scanned in buffer. In a similar manner a plain gold electrode \nvoltammetrically scanned in a buffered solution of ferricyanide again remains stable. The \nstripping of the gold therefore only occurs at electrodes that have been calix[4]resorcinarene \ncoated and exposed to ferricyanide. It is not surprising that during the anodic sweep - and \nfollowing the oxidation of Fe(CN)63-, Fe(CN)64- ions will tend to be repelled from the \nworking electrode. If gold is lost during these potential cycles it would therefore appear that \nFe(CN)64- - calix[4]resorcinarene interaction is greater than the adhesive bonding of the \nAu\/Cr film to the underlying glass substrate. In this case the \ngold\/calix[4]resorcinarene\/Fe(CN)64- is stripped as one entity from the glass backing. \n \nUnfortunately, it is difficult to calculate the work expended in removing the gold-thiol \nlinkage as the observed faradaic peak corresponds not solely to the removal of the \ncalix[4]resorcinarene coating, but principally to the oxidation of Fe(CN)64-. \n 17\n4 Conclusions \n \nThree different redox peaks are observed for the reduction of Fe(CN)63- and the subsequent \nre-oxidation of Fe(CN)64- at calix[4]resorcinarene - modified Au electrodes. Each pair of \npeaks is thought to correspond to the inorganic ion residing in three different environments. It \nis thought that one redox pair corresponds to the ion residing in the calix[4]resorcinarene \nbowl, another to the ion between the bowls and the third to ions stacked above a Fe(CN)63- \nsaturated calix[4]resorcinarene layer. It is also postulated that the calix[4]resorcinarene \ncoating acts as a charge transfer mediator towards Fe(CN)63- ions residing within the bowl \nstructure. FTIR spectroscopy lends further support to this argument. \n \nIt appears that the Fe(CN)63-\/calix[4]resorcinarene association may be stronger than bonding \nof the Au\/Cr film to the glass backing of the electrode, since electrodes exposed to \nferricyanide lose their gold and calix[4]resorcinarene coating when voltametrically scanned \nin a fresh phosphate buffer. \n \n 18\nReferences: \n1.
