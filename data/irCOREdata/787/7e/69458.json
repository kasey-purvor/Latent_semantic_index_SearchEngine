E. Ritchie1,2 and F. Honary2\nReceived 18 December 2008; revised 14 February 2009; accepted 8 March 2009; published 25 June 2009.\n[1] Following particle precipitation at high latitudes that occurs as a result of geomagnetic disturbances,\nthe electron density of the E region of the ionosphere undergoes substantial variation. These variations\nmodify the E layer propagation characteristics which adversely affect HF propagation paths both\nunexpectedly and in many cases for long periods of time. This paper presents two case studies of how the\nenhancement of E region electron density immediately following storm sudden commencement affects\nhigh-latitude HF communications links in and through the auroral zone. Using data gathered from\nionosondes, incoherent scatter radar and an oblique sounder, the Advanced Composition Explorer\nSatellite, and riometers and magnetometers, the physical effects of particle precipitation on the ionospheric\nE layer and the resulting effect on HF links is revealed. Both case studies show that besides the expected\noccurrence of severe short-term absorption and the reduction in the critical frequency of the F layer\ncaused by a redistribution of the electron density in the upper layers of the ionosphere, there is the\nlikelihood a sporadic E layer will form and\/or be enhanced because of significant and sustained particle\nprecipitation. When the critical frequency of the sporadic E layer increases above the norm and in cases\nexceeds the critical frequency of the F layer, there are severe implications for many HF radio\ncommunication systems used at high latitudes unless corrective action is taken.\nCitation: Ritchie, S.

Introduction\n[2] This paper contains two case studies that examine\nthe significant propagation mode changes that occur\nimmediately following storm sudden commencement\n(SSC) events. The studies demonstrate the effect of these\nchanges on propagation links operating in and through\nthe auroral zone. The key changes in the ionosphere\nfollowing the onset of a disturbed ionosphere is the\nrapidly dwindling influence of the F layer as a viable\nreflecting layer and the rise of the Es layer as the primary,\nand in many cases, the only available reflecting layer. This\nchange in propagation mode has implications for system\ndesign when reliable HF communications must be ensured\nand, focuses attention on the importance of understanding\nthe Es layer so that corrective action can be taken.\n[3] Sporadic E (Es) is characterized by little or no retar-\ndation at its critical frequency when viewed on an oblique\nionogram, and may be either blanketing (totally reflecting)\nor semitransparent (partly reflecting), up to very high\nfrequencies. It is understood that energetic particles play\na vital role in the production of Es and that at high\nlatitudes the precipitation of energetic charged particles\ninto the upper atmosphere is a regular occurrence. Most\nof the time at high latitudes the ionisation is dominated by\nenergetic charged particles and only rarely is the iono-\nsphere \u2018\u2018quiet,\u2019\u2019 i.e., varying only with solar zenith angle\nand solar activity (M. Friedrich, Data coverage for D-region\nmodelling, paper presented at XXVIIth General Assem-\nbly, International Union of Radio Science, Maastricht,\nNetherlands, 17--24 August, 2002). These precipitating\nparticles, primarily kilovolt electrons produce most of\ntheir ionisation in the E region [Rees, 1963; Walker, 1972].\nThe maximum density in the disturbed dark ionosphere\nnear 65\u0001 latitude usually occurs in the auroral E layer, a\nthick layer (relative to HF radio wavelengths) with typical\nelectron number densities of 2 to 5 \u0001 1011m\u00023 extending\nfor several degrees of latitude, i.e., a dense, thick and\nwidespread in latitude reflecting layer. The density of\nthe auroral E layer is primarily a function of the rate\nat which energy is deposited in the E region by particle\n1Commission for Communications Regulation, Dublin, Ireland.\n2Department of Communication Systems, University of Lancaster,\nLancaster, UK.\nSPACE WEATHER, VOL. 7, S06005, doi:10.1029\/2008SW000461, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union 1 of 20S06005\nprecipitation, and has been shown to be a highly variable\nphenomenon [Baron, 1974].\n[4] The precipitation of energetic particles is modulated\nconsiderably by geomagnetic storms and substorms. In\nthe course of a substorm, the precipitation of the charged\nparticles from the magnetosphere into the ionosphere\ntakes place, the electrojet is increased, the substorm cur-\nrent wedge system is formed and the electron density and\ncomposition of the ionosphere is changed [Buonsanto,\n1999]. It is known that during the substorm growth phase,\naccelerated particles from the solar wind can penetrate\nthrough the entry layer of the magnetosphere into the\nauroral ionosphere [Blagoveshchensky et al., 2005], causing\nEs layers.\n[5] There have been numerous studies of the high-\nlatitude ionosphere to aid in understanding the response\nof the HF communication channel to space weather\neffects. A review of both effects and the associated\nproblems, with many references, is provided by Leid\n[1967], Goodman [1991], Davies [1991], Hunsucker and Bates\n[1969], and Hunsucker and Hargreaves [2003]. More recently\nBlagoveshchensky et al. [2008] examined the impact of\n14 geomagnetic storms, which occurred during 1997--\n1999, on radio propagation conditions. In this study the\nvariation in the delta between the monthly median values\nand actual maximum operation frequency (MOF) and\nlowest operational frequency (LOF) before, during and\nafter storms was characterized.\n[6] Several measurement campaigns covering the Arctic\nand relying on the oblique sounder as the primary inves-\ntigating tool have been undertaken. Jull [1964] combined\noblique sounder data and riometer absorption data with\na view to improving the reliability of HF communications\nchannels over and through the auroral zone during PCA\nevents and geomagnetic storms. Owren et al. [1963]\nreported on a 3 year campaign into HF propagation over\narctic paths with the behavior of multiple circuits studied\nin detail during disturbed periods with respect to absorp-\ntion measurements and magnetic K indices. (This detailed\nstudy is also summarized by Hunsucker and Hargreaves\n[2003]). Goodman and Ballard [2004] reported on a 2 year\ncampaign examining the nonclimatological patterns of\nsignals associated with an elevated maximum observed\nfrequency (EMOF). They describe the diurnal and seasonal\nbehaviors of EMOF signals, the association of these obser-\nvations with polar patches, blobs and the significant impact\nthese have on over-the-pole air transport operations.\n[7] Goodman et al. [1997] examined 28 middle- and high-\nlatitude paths over an 18 month period to determine the\nvalue of path and frequency diversity on overcoming\nvarious deleterious effects and a practical engineering\nsolution was offered to affect a near 100% channel avail-\nability. Bro\u00a8ms and Lundborg [1994] and Lundborg et al. [1995]\nreported on two oblique sounding campaigns undertaken\nin Sweden. The first campaign examined the variation of\nF2MOF, 2-hop F2MOF and LOF on short time scales from\nday to day outside disturbed conditions, noting the good\nagreement between oblique and vertical sounder data\nand the linear relationship between variations in F2MOF\nand 2-hop F2MOF. The later campaign, covering the maxi-\nmum of solar cycle 22, assessed the accuracy of prediction\nmethods during regular and disturbed periods and the\npossibilities of exploiting any additional propagation\nmodes such as backscatter, spread F and sporadic E.\n[8] While the influence of Es on high-latitude propaga-\ntion has been published before [e.g., Blagoveshchensky et\nal., 2008; Jull, 1964; Goodman et al., 1997] this paper presents\na comprehensive assessment of two specific links with a\nvariety of sensors and techniques, some of which were\nnote available until recent years. Both case studies pre-\nsented in this paper use Storm Sudden Commencements\nas the starting point for analysis. Disturbances in the solar\nwind such as shock waves and dynamic pressure pulses\n[Wilken et al., 1982; Tsurutani et al., 1995; Takeuchi et al.,\n2002], when impinging on the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere,\ncompresses it and increases the magnetopause current.\nThis leads to a change in the low-latitude ground-based\ngeomagnetic field intensity, lasting typically for some tens\nof minutes. These signatures in the geomagnetic H field,\nseen suddenly and simultaneously at ground magnetic\nobservatories [Rastogi et al., 2001] are called storm sudden\ncommencements and mark the beginning of a geomag-\nnetic storm or an increase in activity lasting at least 1 h.\n[9] These SSC are understood to be the magnetic signa-\nture of an interplanetary shockwave, for example, Burlaga\nand Ogilvie [1969] report that all seven SSC events in their\nstudy were caused by hydromagnetic shocks in the solar\nwind. The SSC generated by these hydromagnetic shock\nwaves transform the magnetosphere into a new com-\npressed steady state configuration which is in balance\nwith the increased solar wind pressure [Wilken et al.,\n1982, 1986; Tamao, 1975]. In achieving the new steady state\nconfiguration a substantial flux of energetic particles are\ncaused to precipitate into the high-latitude ionosphere.\n[10] The advantages of using SSC events as the point of\norigin of both case studies is twofold. First, the SSC\nidentifies the start of the change of composition of the\nionosphere with associated energetic particle precipita-\ntion. Second, the occurrence and timing of an SSC is\ninternationally agreed [International Service of Geomagnetic\nIndices, 2008] and therefore a very useful reference point\nwhen comparing results from a number of different\ninstruments in different locations.\n2. Importance of the Es Layer for HF\nCommunications at High Latitudes\n[11] The use of HF radiocommunications at high lati-\ntudes still forms the back bone of many communications\nsystems. At high latitudes there are few alternatives to HF\nradio for the merchant and fishing fleets, military forces\n(land, sea and air) and for the civil aviation industry. HF\npropagation at high latitudes during magnetic disturban-\nces has been an enigma, in part because ionograms do not\nalways provide analyzable data because of absorption,\nS06005 RITCHIE AND HONARY: SSC: EFFECT ON HF AT HIGH LATITUDES\n2 of 20\nS06005\nblanketing and spread F. Following disturbances, rapid\nand large changes in ionospheric parameters occur, appar-\nently so randomly that little sense can be made of them.\n[12] Crucial to the importance of the Es layer, is that at\nhigh latitudes the critical frequency of the F2 layer ( foF2) is\nnot much greater than the critical frequency of the Es layer\n( foEs) and therefore most rays are cut off by the Es layer,\nshowing up as one or two hop Es layer reflections instead\nof the expected one hop F2 reflection. However, these Es\nmodes have different frequency\/ground range dependen-\ncies than the F2 mode. This phenomena known as \u2018\u2018E layer\ncut off\u2019\u2019 [Davies, 1965] is significant in high-latitude regions\nbecause any frequency which penetrates the Es layer at a\ngiven point to reach the F layer is also close to the\nmaximum useable frequency (MUF) of the F2 layer at its\npoint of incidence with that layer. Partially reflecting Es\ncan cause serious multipath and mode interference, espe-\ncially detrimental to data transmission systems.\n[13] A further reason for unreliable F2 mode propagation\nat high latitudes is the possibility of complete blockage (or\nscreening) of the F layer by Es. This occurs when the\nelectron density in the E region is sufficiently enhanced\nso that penetration of the layer is not possible and Es\nblocks propagation via higher-altitude layers. Such a layer\nof Es would augment the power in a signal propagated at a\nfrequency below the E layer MUF. For example, a highly\nionised patch of Es may make F2 layer propagation impos-\nsible but may also contribute to a low-loss reflection point\non an E mode propagation path thus enhancing that\nmode\u2019s signal quality.\n[14] While these characteristics can be helpful or harm-\nful to radio communications, either type of Es (i.e., partially\nblanketing and full blanketing) may extend the useful\nfrequency range and its presence can be effectively used\nin system design and operations if it is understood [Lane,\n2001]. Of course, for the Es mode path to be successfully\nused, the antenna at both the receiver and transmitter\nmust have a suitable radiation pattern with sufficient gain\nto take advantage of the different range of transmission\nangles required to achieve the same ground range as a\nF layer using a Es layer reflection path.\n3. Data and Instrumentation\n[15] The primary instrument used in these case studies\nto demonstrate the effect of Es layers on HF communica-\ntions, immediately following an SSC event, is an oblique\nsounder. The University of Leicester oblique sounder\nsystem consisted of a swept frequency HF transmitter at\nIsfjord, Svalbard and a receiving system set up initially at\nthe Collaborative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding\nSystem (CUTLASS) radar site in Hankasalmi, Finland\nand then at Malvern, UK. The transmitter was operated\nby the Defense Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA),\nMalvern, and consists of an exciter unit developed and\nbuilt by the Radio and Space Plamsa Physics Group at\nLeicester University and a transmitter built by DERA. The\nunit transmits a chirp signal ranging in frequency from 2\nto 30 MHz into a broadband antenna. The transmitter\npower is approx 10W and the sweep time is approx 5 min.\nThe receiver consists of the DERA Iris receiving system\nsupplemented by a communication system developed at\nLeicester to provide real-time control and data recovery\n[University of Leicester, 2007].\n[16] Oblique ionograms obtained from the system indi-\ncate the modal structure of signals propagating between\nSvalbard and Hankasalmi and Svalbard and Malvern, at\nfrequencies up to 30 MHz. Soundings are carried out at\n15 min intervals and the results are shown as oblique\nionograms. In the oblique sounder ionograms the abscissa\nis sounding frequency given in MHz and the ordinate axis\nis group delay in milliseconds. The delay indicated on the\nionograms is a relative rather than absolute delay as the\nreceiver locks onto the earliest arriving signal to set the\naxis.\n[17] Supporting data is obtained from vertical sounders,\nmore commonly known as ionosondes, located at Troms\u00f8\nand Gakona. The basic principle of vertical incidence\nionospheric sounding is that HF radio waves are reflected\nat the cut-off frequencies of the ionospheric magneto-\nplasma. To probe the E and F regions of the ionosphere\na vertical sounder scans from 1 to 20 MHz, transmitting\nmodulated radio waves and receiving and analyzing the\nreflected echo signals form the ionosphere [Wright et al.,\n1957; Piggott and Rawer, 1972]. Conventionally the iono-\nsonde presents the demodulated echo signals as time of\nflight (range) versus sounding frequency in the form of\nionograms. Extensive details on ionosondes and their\napplications are given by Ivanov et al. [2003] and Reinisch\n[1996].\n[18] Electron densities in the E and F regions are\nobtained from incoherent scatter radars (ISR), namely\nthe European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF radar\nnear Tromso and the Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) at\nSondrestrom, Greenland. In the ISR method, incoherent\nscatter is produced by backscatter from the thermal irreg-\nularities in the ionization in the upper atmosphere. The\nsignal amplitude and spectral shape yield the electron\ndensity and electron and ion temperature, while the\nspectral shift yields the average velocity of the ions [Bates\nand Hunsucker, 1974].\n[19] Solar Wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)\ndata is obtained from measurements taken by the\nAdvanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft. The\nACE satellite carries high-resolution sensors and moni-\ntoring instruments that sample the parameters of low-\nenergy particles of solar origin and high-energy galactic\nparticles. See Stone et al. [1998] for comprehensive details\nof the satellite and instrumentation.\n[20] Magnetometer datawas collected from theGlenmore\nLodge magnetometer which is part of SAMNET, the UK\nSub-Auroral Magnetometer Network which continuously\nrecords natural variations in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field\ngiving information about the complex interactions within\nthe coupled Solar Wind-Magnetosphere-Ionosphere sys-\nS06005 RITCHIE AND HONARY: SSC: EFFECT ON HF AT HIGH LATITUDES\n3 of 20\nS06005\ntem. Each station records the magnetic field in three\northogonal components: H, D, and Z, these being horizon-\ntal magnetic northward, horizontal magnetic eastward and\nvertically downward.\n[21] Riometer data was obtained from the Imaging Riom-\neter for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS) located at Kilpisja\u00a8rvi,\nFinland. In essence a riometer observes temporal varia-\ntions in ionisation in the D and E regions caused by\ncharged particle precipitation [Hargreaves, 1969]. While\nthe most common form of riometer uses a wide beam\nantenna with bandwidths of in the order of 60\u0001 [e.g., Little\nand Leinbach, 1959], the IRIS has 49 narrow beams of beam\nwidth between 13\u0001 and 16\u0001 [Browne et al., 1995] and\noperates as a fast-scan multiple beam instrument which\nexamines the whole ionospheric sky to 45\u0001 from zenith.\nOperation is passive and the background cosmic radio\nnoise from the sky is constantly monitored. By comparing\nthe background cosmic radio noise from the sky against\nthe received signal for an undisturbed day it is possible to\ndetermine the variation of ionospheric absorption within\neach beam.\n[22] Table 1 details the location of all instruments used\nin these studies which are shown in Figure 1, on a great\ncircle map centered on the oblique sounder transmitter at\nTable 1.

Table 2 details the bearing and range of the\ngreat circle propagation path between the oblique sounder\ntransmitter and both oblique sounder receiver sites shown\nin Figure 1.\n4. Case Studies\n[23] The case studies presented in this paper examine\ntwo north-south auroral propagation paths following the\nonset of a geomagnetic disturbance. The objective of these\nstudies is to understand the changes that occur in the\nionospheric layers and the resultant propagation mode\nchanges that occur. This will reveal how propagation\nmodeling needs to adapt in order to best utilize the\nchanges that occur as well as the practical aspects that\nmust be considered when using the modified ionosphere.\n[24] The key difference in the two case studies is the\ngreat circle path length between the transmitter and\nthe receiver. In the first case study with a path length of\n1807 km the 1E mode of propagation dominates following\nthe SSC. In the second case study, with a path length of\nnearly 3000 km, the 2E mode of propagation dominates.\n4.1. SSC of 31 July 1999\n[25] This case study examines the propagation path\nbetween Isfjord, Svalbard and Hankasalmi, Finland\na distance of 1807 km following an SSC at 1827 UT on\n31 July 1999.\n[26] In the period preceding 31 July 1999 solar activity\nranged from low to high levels [NOAA, 1999a]. Solar\nactivity increased to high levels on 29 July by virtue of\nan impulsive M5 flare on the 29 July at 19:34UT from\nRegion 8651 which was accompanied by minor discrete\nradio emissions. Activity returned to moderate levels on\n30 July with another isolated, low-level M class flare from\nRegion 8649. A coronal mass ejection signature was evident\non 30 July with a velocity increase from 380 to 680 km s\u00021,\nincreased densities, and a period of sustained southward\nIMF Bz with deflections to minus 12 nT (GSM). Activity\ndecreased to low levels on the day following the SSC with\noccasional C class flares from regions 8645 and 8651.\nNo proton events were detected at geosynchronous orbit\nduring the period. The solar wind and IMF data for the\nimmediate period of the SSC is shown in Figures 2a--2d.\n[27] Figure 2a represents the solar wind particle density\n(cm\u00023) against time. At 1740 UT following 7 h of low\nactivity and low density (1.37 cm\u00023) the density increases\nvery quickly to 11.4 cm\u00023. The density remains at elevated\nlevels for more than 1 h before moderating. Figure 2c\nrepresents Bz, the north-south component of the IMF. Bz is\npositive when, in parallel with the Earth\u2019s field, the\nnorthward direction of the magnetic field points upward.\nAt the magnetopause the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and the\nIMF come into contact. If the IMF points southward (i.e., Bz\nis negative) then the IMF can partially cancel the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field at the point of contact, make direct con-\nnection with field lines and allow the injection of energy\ninto the magnetosphere. Southward turning of the IMF\ninitiates changes in the configuration of the magneto-\nsphere, Earthward displacement of the magnetopause\nand tailward stretching of the field lines, where energetic\nparticles are more subject to precipitation because of\nchanges in drift shells [Ranta and Ranta, 1990].\n[28] From 1000 to 1530 UT Bz is mainly northward with a\nfew short excursions southward. Just before 1530 UT Bz\nbecomes predominantly southward with an excursion\nnorthward around 1600 UT. Coinciding with the sudden\nincrease in density (Figure 2a) at 1740 UT is a sudden\nchange in the direction of Bz from south to north. Bz turns\nsouthward again after 2 h of maintaining its northward\ndirection. Figure 2b represents the solar wind particle\nvelocity (km s\u00021) and shows an increasing velocity coin-\nciding with the increase in particle density, IMF field\nstrength and the change in Bz. The values of solar wind\nparticle density and velocity have a direct and strong\ncorrelation to the amplitude of the IMF which in turn\ninfluences the location of the magnetopause [Fairfield,\n1971].\n[29] These sudden enhancements in the solar wind\ndynamic pressure are known to compress the magneto-\nsphere and enhance the magnetopause current [Kaufmann\nand Konradi, 1969], as well as the tail currents [Russell et al.,\n1994]. Zesta et al. [2000] noted in a study of the 10 January\n1977 disturbance that the response of the magnetosphere\nto a pressure front was practically instantaneous, global\nand directly driven by the propagation of the solar wind\ndensity enhancement region through the magnetosphere.\nThe disturbance is transmitted throughout the magneto-\nsphere in the form of hydromagnetic waves and has been\nobserved both at satellite altitudes and on the ground as a\nsudden increase or decrease in the geomagnetic field\nstrength. Corresponding to the changes in geomagnetic\nfield strength are changes in the magnetic field geometry,\nthe electric field configuration as well as changes in\nthermal and energetic particle distributions.\n[30] The geomagnetic field was at quiet to unsettled\nlevels until 31 July when a sudden storm commencement\noccurred at 1827 UT followed by active to major storm\nlevels with brief severe storm periods at high latitudes.\nThe disturbance continued until 1 August (not shown\nhere). Magnetometer data for the immediate period of\nthe SSC is shown in Figure 2e. It can be seen that the\ndisturbance in the solar wind measured at the ACE\nsatellite at 1740 UT took circa 45 min to reach the mag-\nnetosphere and for the effect to be measured by the\nTable 2.

Twenty-five min before the SSC occurred\nthe ionosphere is fairly quiet as the oblique ionogram in\nFigure 3a reflects. Figure 3a shows reflections from 8 to\n11 MHz from the F layer and at the incident angle required\nto achieve a one hop F layer path between transmitter and\nreceiver the F layer oblique critical frequency is approxi-\nmately 11 MHz. At lower-takeoff angles the Es layer\nbecomes usable for signals between 11 and 15 MHz along\nthis path.\n[32] Figure 3b captures the situation 5 min after the SSC\noccurs when particle precipitation and the resultant\nenhanced E layer ionisation has set in. While the F layer\nstill provides a valid path, the enhanced electron density\ndue to precipitation has increased the usable frequency of\nthe E layer well above the initial value to 15 MHz. Between\n9 and 10 MHz there are now two raypaths in existence,\none from the F layer and a new path from the Es layer.\n[33] Figure 3c is 20 min after the SSC when the Es layer is\nenhanced further as evidenced by the higher-power\nreturns, the useful frequency of the Es layer is further\nextended to more than 20 MHz. The F layer path has\ndegraded because of intense D region absorption attenu-\nating the lower frequencies, as will be seen in Figure 4.\nFigure 3d is 1 h after the SSC occurs the F layer is starting\nto recover with a critical frequency of 9 MHz and the\nE layer enhancement, while patchy and a much weaker\npath than the F layer path, can now support frequencies\nup to 30 MHz.\n[34] Figure 4 captures the absorption measured by beam\nnine of the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi riometer. For this study the riometer\nis not ideally located to measure absorption at the exact\npoint where the ray penetrates the D layer and is only\nused to illustrate the general pattern of D layer absorption\nin the area.\n[35] Before the SSC at 18:27UT the absorption measured\nat 38.2 MHz is less than 0.1 dB. Following the SSC the\nabsorption increases and at 18:47UT (Figure 3c) the\nabsorption has increased to 0.4 dB. Neglecting the effects\nof the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, auroral absorption can be\nshown to be inversely proportional to the square of the\noperating frequency [Browne et al., 1995], therefore 0.4 dB\nof absorption measured on the riometer at 38.2 MHz\nequates to 23 dB absorption at 5 MHz and to 6 dB at\n10 MHz. Of course any ray reflecting in the ionosphere at\nthe mid point would suffer twice this absorption as the ray\npenetrates the D layer twice. At 19:32UT (Figure 3d) the\nabsorption has reduced slightly to 0.3 dB and continues to\nfall until 2002 UT (Figure 5a) before increasing again (as\nreflected in Figure 5b) at 2032 UT to values in excess of\nFigure 3. Selection of oblique ionograms from the Svalbard to Hankasalmi path.\nS06005 RITCHIE AND HONARY: SSC: EFFECT ON HF AT HIGH LATITUDES\n7 of 20\nS06005\n1 dB absorption (measured at 38.2 MHz) which equates to\n58 dB absorption at 5 MHz and 15 dB at 10 MHz.\n[36] Figure 5 is a further selection of post-SSC oblique\nionograms. Figure 5a is 90 min after the SSC the F layer\nhas recovered and assuming more of an early evening\nstructure. D layer absorption has reduced sufficiently (as\nshown in Figure 4) so that frequencies as low as 3 MHz\ncan be seen reflecting from the F layer. The Es layer\ncontinues to be enhanced by precipitation and maintains\nan oblique top frequency near 30MHz. Figure 5b is 120min\nafter the SSC the E layer enhancement, while still signif-\nicant, has begun to wane and has become patchy in places.\nReflections from the F layer are again affected by D layer\nabsorption which as shown in Figure 4 has increased at\nthis time.\n[37] Figure 6 is a selection of ionograms from the\nTromso Ionosonde located approximately at the midpoint\nof the propagation path. Figure 6a is 4 min before the SSC\noccurs the ionosphere is quiet and a fairly typical early\nevening ionogram is displayed. The F2 layer vertical crit-\nical frequency ( foF2) is 5.5 MHz and the virtual height of\nthe F2 layer (h\u2019f) is 300 km. The E layer vertical critical\nfrequency ( foE) is 2.85 MHz and the virtual height of the\nE layer (h\u2019E) is 105 km.\n[38] Figure 6b is 20 min after the SSC foF2 remains at\n5.5 MHz but h\u2019f has increased to 385 km. The F layer has\nincreased considerably in height because of electron den-\nsity depletion at lower altitudes. There is some trace\nspread (typical of precipitation events) which makes the\nvirtual heights difficult to determine accurately. The Es\nFigure 4.

The\n0.37 dB of absorption at 38.2 MHz equates to a total\nabsorption of 260 dB at 2 MHz for a ray passing twice\nthrough the D region.\n[39] Figure 6c is 60 min after the SSC particle precipita-\ntion continues to be in evidence as shown by the wide-\nspread occurrence of spread E and spread F. The E layer\nhas taken on a slant characteristic rising from 90 to 220 km\nas the frequency increases. The F2 critical frequency ( foF2)\nis now 5.7 MHz and foEs is 7 MHz (ignore the extraordi-\nnary wave reflection (green trace)). This ionogram falls\njust before the third absorption spike seen in Figure 4 and\nreflections are visible down to the lowest usable iono-\nsonde frequency.\n[40] Figure 7a is 2 h after the SSC the ionosphere has\nrecovered with a blanketing Es layer up to 3.3 MHz. The\nvirtual height of the F layer has reduced slightly. Figure 7b\nis 3 h and 20 min after the SSC the ionosphere is further\ndisturbed by substorms (as evident in Figure 4) which\nprovides further precipitation of high-energy particles\nresulting in the E layer reforming with foEs approaching\n3.5 MHz and the F layer virtual height rising to 450 km.\n[41] To assist in demonstrating the problem a simple ray\ntrace analysis of the path between Svalbard and Hanka-\nsalmi has been undertaken. The geometry of conventional\nmode configurations is shown in Figure 8. Symmetrical\nmode geometry is assumed and the location of the Tromso\nionosonde and the Kilpisja\u00a8rvi riometer is indicated in\nrelation to the distances from the transmitter.\n[42] In the conventional mode and assuming an E layer\nheight of 110 km a 1E raypath is possible with a take off\nangle of 2.8\u0001. A 2E is also possible with a take off angle of\n11\u0001. Three F layer modes are possible with a 1F at 11\u0001, a 2F\nat 26.5\u0001 and a 3F at 38.5\u0001. The 1E and 1F control points and\nthe second 3F control point is very nearly directly above\nthe Tromso ionosonde. Figure 8 shows the option for two\nE layer paths and three F layer paths. Evident on the\noblique sounder is however only the 1E and 1F raypaths\nwhich according to Figure 8 have a reflection point in the\ncenter of the great circle path. The reflection point for any\nother raypaths would require similar ionospheric charac-\nteristics at each of the reflection points. For the 2E and 2F\nFigure 6. Selection of vertical ionograms from the Tromso ionosonde. (The x axis is frequency in\nMHz, and the y axis is virtual height in km.)\nS06005 RITCHIE AND HONARY: SSC: EFFECT ON HF AT HIGH LATITUDES\n9 of 20\nS06005\npaths similar ionospheric characteristics are needed at the\n450 km and 1350 km reflection points. For the 3E and 3F\npaths, similar ionospheric characteristics would be re-\nquired at the 300 km, 900 km and 1500 km reflection\npoints. In highly variable high-latitude ionosphere it is\nnot surprising that the conditions for any path other than\nthe single ionospheric reflection paths (the 1E and 1F\npaths) is achievable. With the availability of the Tromso\nionosonde close to the center of the link path, the actual\nvirtual heights of the E and F layers can be incorporated\ninto the geometry of the mode configurations.\n[43] As shown in Figure 9 while the Es layer modes of\noperation continue to operate around the 110--120 km\naltitude mark the convention of ray tracing the F layer at\n250 km is not valid and a virtual height of 350 km is for this\nsituation a more accurate parameter. At a F layer height of\n350 km the 1F ray angle changes from 11\u0001 to 14\u0001, the 2F\nchanges from 26\u0001 to 35\u0001 and the 3F ray from 38\u0001 to 47\u0001.\nFigure 7b shows that the virtual height of the F layer can\nbe as high as 450 km. With reference to Figure 9, this\nwould require a 1F ray takeoff angle of 22\u0001, a 2F takeoff\nangle of 42\u0001 and a 3F take off able of 59\u0001. In the 450 km case\nand in some of the 350 km case, taking the secant rule into\naccount, it is very likely that the 2F and 3F rays are\npenetrating through the ionosphere and hence not reflect-\ning in any manner.\n[44] Using the modified geometry the F layer path and\nthe Es layer path were modeled using the well known HF\npropagation planning tool, VOACAP [Lane, 2001] in the\npoint-to-point configuration. The validity of using HF\npropagation prediction programs has been addressed by\nBro\u00a8ms and Lundborg [1994] who found good agreement\nbetween the prediction and measurements made during\nquiet conditions and Hunsucker [1999] (as summarized by\nFigure 7. A further selection of vertical ionograms from the Tromso ionosonde. (The x axis is\nfrequency in MHz, and the y axis is virtual height in km.)\nFigure 8. Geometry of conventional mode configurations.\nS06005 RITCHIE AND HONARY: SSC: EFFECT ON HF AT HIGH LATITUDES\n10 of 20\nS06005\nHunsucker and Hargreaves [2003]) who noted the aggregate\ncorrect prediction of these programs was only \u000345%\nunder disturbed conditions. However, using the actual\nlayer height info from the vertical sounder allows some\nlimited but relevant modeling to be undertaken even after\nthe onset of disturbed conditions. The modeling shows\nthat the increase in virtual height of the F layer from\n250 km to 450 km results in an increase in transmission\nloss of 6 dB and an additional spreading loss of 4 dB. As\nthe Es layer maintains its virtual height it does not suffer\nthe same degradation. The result, for this case study, is a\n10 dB increase in losses when using the partially blocked\nF layer during the disturbed period. In terms of signal-\nto-noise ratio (SNR) this results in the SNR of the Es layer\npath exceeding the F layer SNR by 3--5 dB.\n[45] Using 10 MHz as the default frequency of operation,\nthe median SNR of a blanketing Es layer increased by 3 dB\nover the normal (nondisturbed) F layer and increasing the\nfrequency of operation by 3 MHz increased the median\nSNR achievable on the link by 8 dB overall and the\nincrease in SNR has a direct affect on the reliability of\nthe link. The principle being demonstrated is that a small\nincrease in operating frequency during the disturbed\nperiod can assist in maximum utilization of a blanketing\nEs layer.\n[46] The apparent increase in received field strength is\nnot clearly shown in the oblique ionograms. This is most\nlikely as a result of the antenna used at both the trans-\nmitter and receiver sites. The radiation angle of the\nvertical antenna varies considerably as operating frequency\nvaries [McNamara, 1991] and with the wide operating\nrange of the oblique sounder (2 -- 30 MHz) it is very\ndifficult to achieve sufficient gain at low-elevation angles,\nless than 3\u0001 in this case study. As a result the oblique\nionograms do not reflect the increase in SNR in the Es\nlayer returns when compared to F layer returns for which\nthe vertical dipole antenna is better matched. The princi-\nple that must be taken into account if the Es layer is to be\nused as a replacement for the F layer during disturbed\nperiods is that an antenna capable of fully utilizing the\nvery low elevation angles must be used. A further practical\nconsideration in very low angle operations is the need to\nclear any obstruction at the receiver and transmitter site to\nmaximize this mode of operation. The very low angles in\nuse do however restrict the lengths of any 1Es path to an\nabsolute maximum of 2000 km after which the takeoff\nangle is reduced to nearly 0\u0001.\n4.2. SSC of 15 September 1999\n[47] This further example examines the propagation\npath between Isfjord, Svalbard and Malvern, UK a dis-\ntance of 2990 km. This case study is different from the first\nin a number of ways. First the great circle path length is\nlong enough to preclude a 1E mode of propagation and\nthe receiver is well out of the auroral zone. The Bz\ncomponent of the solar wind does not change direction\nfollowing the evening SSC being northward before the\nSSC at 2019 UT and moving further northward in the 5 h\nfollowing the SSC. There is a greater delta change in foE\nimmediately following the SSC followed by similar sub-\nsequent changes to the value of foE. Finally, ISR data is\navailable from two spatially well separated instruments\nshowing the changes in electron density in the ionosphere\nbefore and after the SSC occurs.\n[48] Solar activity was predominately low before and\nafter 15 September dominated by events in Region 8700\nwhich developed a mixed polarity sunspot group and\nproduced numerous C class flares [NOAA, 1999b]. The\nperiod before and after 15 September was dominated by\nhigh-speed coronal hole conditions. Wind speeds were\nhigh, ranging from 550 to 650 km s\u00021 and the IMF Bz\nfluctuated between northward and southward for most of\nthe time with prolonged periods of predominately south-\nward conditions. No proton events were detected at geo-\nFigure 9. Modified geometry of conventional mode configurations.\nS06005 RITCHIE AND HONARY: SSC: EFFECT ON HF AT HIGH LATITUDES\n11 of 20\nS06005\nsynchronous orbit during the period. The solar wind\ndata for the immediate period of the SSC is shown in\nFigures 10a--10d.\n[49] Figure 10a shows solar wind particle density (cm\u00023)\nagainst time. The first disturbance occurred at 0703 UT\nwhen the density increased from 2.9 cm\u00023 to a peak of\n6.6 cm\u00023. The second clearer step change occurred at\n19:41UT when the density suddenly increased from\n2.8 cm\u00023 to 7.5 cm\u00023. In both cases there was more than\na doubling of density. Figure 10b shows the solar wind\nparticle velocity, at the first disturbance the velocity\nincreased from 486 to 605 km s\u00021 a substantial change of\nmore than 100 km s\u00021. At the second disturbance the\nvelocity increased from 560 to 608 km s\u00021, an increase of\n48 km s\u00021.\n[50] Figure 10c shows the magnitude and direction of Bz,\nBz is slightly southward and moves slightly northward just\nbefore the first disturbance and becomes stronger south-\nward following the disturbance. The situation is different\nfor the second disturbance as Bz has been northward for a\nnumber of hours before the disturbance and becomes\neven stronger northward following the disturbance.\nFigure 10d shows the interplanetary magnetic field\nstrength (nT). The magnetic field strength jumps from\n6 nT to 12.1 nT during the first disturbance and from\n4.7 nT to 8.3 nT during the second disturbance.\n[51] The geomagnetic field experienced minor to major\ndisturbances at high latitudes associated with a high-speed\ncoronal hole stream over the week 13 -- 19 September\n1999. On September 15 midlatitudes experienced minor\nstorm level and high latitudes experienced severe storm-\ning in conjunction with the high-speed shock mentioned\nabove. The effects of the high-speed stream began to\ndiminish only four days later. Magnetometer data for the\nimmediate period of the SSC is shown in Figure 10e. The\nfirst disturbance in the solar wind at 07:03UT was mea-\nsured on the Earth\u2019s surface at 07:55UT. The magnetom-\neter displayed a small reduction in the H component, a\nrecovery and then a step decline from 1108 nT to 1045 nT.\nThe second disturbance in the solar wind at 19:41UT was\nmeasured by a change in the magnetometer from 1128 nT\nto a peak of 1156 nT at 2020 UT. Both magnetometer\nsignatures are typical mid- to high-latitude magnetometer\nSSC indicators with preliminary and main impulses as\nexplained by Ferraro et al. [1951] and Araki [1977].\n[52] The UHF ISR at Tromso was in operation from 15:08\non 15 September 1999 to 13:00 the following day. Figure 11\nshows the electron density versus altitude data from\n1508 UT on the 15 September until noon on the next\nday. When the ISR begins measurements the E region\nelectron density above 100 km altitude is already enhanced\nbecause of magnetic activity during the day following the\n0753 UT SSC.\n[53] At the time of the second SSC (2019 UT) the ISR\nshows a sudden enhancement in electron density at alti-\ntudes around 150 km and low as 100 km. The electron\ndensity increases from about 2.5 \u0001 1010 m\u00023 to 6.3 \u0001\n1010 m\u00023, more than a doubling of electron density which\nlasts for more than 3 h. It should be noted that the electron\ndensity values quoted should not be seen as absolute\nvalues but rather as an indication of the scale of change\nthat occurs during this period and the subsequent effect\non ionospheric propagation. The electron density between\n100 km and 150 km altitude decreases after midnight but\njust after 0100 UT the following day the electron density\nundergoes frequent and intense enhancements until at\nleast 1100 UT. This is a result of ongoing precipitation due\nto substorms that followed the SSC.\n[54] Figure 12 covering the same period as Figure 11 is\ntaken from the ISR at Sondrestrom which was in operation\nfrom 2241 UT on 14 September to 2400 UT on 17 September\n1999. The E region enhancement (circled in Figure 12)\nbegins near 20:20UT and lasts for about 2 h, very similar to\nwhat has been seen in the EISCAT data even though the\ntwo ISR\u2019s are spatially well separated (Figure 1 refers).\nFollowing a 3 h period of relative quiet the Sondrestrom\nISR shows a 2 h sudden enhancement in electron density\nreaching peaks of 13 \u0001 1010 m\u00023. Again the electron\ndensity values quoted should not be seen as absolute\nvalues but rather a reflection of the scale of change that\nis possible and the consequences these changes have on\nionospheric propagation.\n[55] A selection of oblique sounder ionograms from the\nSvalbard to Malvern propagation path are shown in\nFigure 13. Figure 13a is 17 min before the SSC occurs\nthe F region is disturbed with only a small window of\nreflection between 2.5 -- 4 MHz. There is a slight return\nfrom the E layer around 11 MHz. Figure 13b is 13 min after\nthe SSC occurs the high-latitude E region is strongly\nenhanced forming an Es layer reflection path between\n10 and 18 MHz. At this point there is virtually no F layer\npath visisble.\n[56] Figure 13c is a further 60 min on and the situation\nremains unchanged. Standard predictions of this propa-\ngation path are useless as the enhanced E region dominates\nand no F layer path is available. Figure 13d is a further\n60 min on, now 2 h and 15 min after the SSC occurs and\nthe situation remains virtually unchanged. The E region\nwindow has reduced slightly to cover 10.8 -- 17.5 MHz.\nThere is a slight return from the F layer around 2 MHz.\nIt is likely that any return of signals below 10 MHz is\neither suffering extensive D region absorption or there is\nsimply no suitable reflecting F layer available because of\nionisation depletion at these altitudes.\n[57] Figure 14 is a selection of ionograms from the\nTromso Ionosonde showing similar characteristics to that\nseen in the first case study. Figure 14a is 7 min before the\nSSC occurs. The F region is disturbed and h\u2019F has already\nincreased to 405 km. This change in reflection height\nwould adversely affect HF links and HF broadcasting\nservices which usually assume an h\u2019F of around 250 km\nin the planning process which in turn determines the\namount of power and type of antenna to be used. The\nantenna type is most often dependent on the takeoff angle\nS06005 RITCHIE AND HONARY: SSC: EFFECT ON HF AT HIGH LATITUDES\n12 of 20\nS06005\nFigure 10.

FoEs is already above the norm at 3 MHz at this\nstage.\n[58] Figure 14b is 11 min after the SSC occurs the Es\nlayer is dramatically enhanced and almost completely\nblankets the F region. Here foEs is 2.9 MHz with a F region\nwindow of only 0.5 MHz between 3 -- 3.5 MHz. Figure 14c\nis the situation continues and more than 1 h later, in the\n21:24UT ionogram, a similar situation exists with FoEs = 3.1\nMHz which is sufficient to completely blanket the F\nregion. Interestingly in this case we do not see the large\nincreases in virtual F layer heights as seen in the first case\nstudy.\n[59] The virtual height of the F layer (>400 km, Figure 14)\nbefore and after the SSC, the low frequencies seen on the\noblique high raypath (>2ms, Figure 13) and the 28\u0001 take off\nangle required; fits in well with the considered view that a\n2F mode occurs normally instead of a 1F mode on this\npath. As the length of the path prohibits a 1E mode of\npropagation, a 2E mode with a take off angle of 5\u0001\ndominates following the SSC.\n[60] Figure 15 is a selection of ionograms from the\nGakona Ionosonde which captured events around the\nSSC that occurred at 0753 UT. This ionosonde, located\non the other side of the polar cap from the link transmitter\nis included to show the extent of the ionospheric distur-\nbance following the SSC.\n[61] Figure 15a is a fairly disturbed early morning iono-\ngram where trace spread makes it difficult to extract any\naccurate parameters, however foF is approximately\n3.2 MHz and foEs is approximately 2.8 MHz. It is difficult\nto determine h\u2019f from the ionogram. Figure 15b is 37 min\nafter the SSC a dense sporadic E layer has formed which\nalmost completely blankets the F region, foEs has extended\nto 5.5 MHz. The second reflection from the E layer is\nvisible at a height of 220 km and a small reflection is\nvisible from the F layer at a height of 280 km. Figure 15c is\nthe now fully blanketing Es layer continues for at least\nanother 2 h after SSC, albeit slightly patchy at the top end.\n5. Conclusions\n[62] Six different instruments have been utilized in these\ncase studies to show the cause and effect of enhanced Es\nlayers immediately following an SSC. These studies\ndemonstrate the profound effects these sporadic layers\nhave on high-latitude HF circuits by dramatically extend-\ning the E layer maximum usable frequency (MUF) and\/or\n\u2018\u2018shielding\u2019\u2019 any F layer raypaths.\n[63] Data from the ACE satellite is used to show the\nmagnitude of changes that occur in the solar wind due to\ndisturbances in the solar wind, such as when shock waves\nand dynamic pressure pulses move past the satellite on\nFigure 13.

The\nstep changes in total magnetic field strength, particle\ndensity and velocity as well as changes in direction of\nthe Bz component are shown. The direction of Bz changes\nfrom south to north in the first case study but starts\nnorthward and becomes progressively more northward\nin the second case study. Changes in the ground-based\ngeomagnetic field intensity due to an increase in magne-\ntopause current, as a result of magnetospheric compres-\nsion caused by solar wind disturbances, are seen in the\nmagnetometer data.\n[64] The observation of sudden changes in the solar\nwind which are the cause of SSC is well understood as\nis the prediction of the time delay between observation by\nthe ACE satellite platform and the arrival of the distur-\nbance at the Earth\u2019s surface. The SSC event is used as a\nproxy to herald the change between a \u2018\u2018quiet\u2019\u2019 and a\n\u2018\u2018disturbed\u2019\u2019 high-latitude ionosphere and the subsequent\nonset of an enhanced E layer. However, for the first time\nthe linkage between SSC and the enhanced E layer ionisa-\ntion is exposed in both case studies detailed in this paper.\n[65] Ionosonde records show how the usefulness of the\nF layer is reduced as its electron density decreases and its\nvirtual height increases following disturbances initiated\nby the SSC. The records further show the enhancement of\nthe Es layer for extended periods, in both cases for at least\n2 h and in one case as long as 3 h. The enhancement is so\ngreat in some cases that the F layer is completely screened\noff from the ground. The Troms\u00f8 ionosonde, close to the\ncenter of the first case study link path demonstrates the\nchange that occurs in the height of the F layer around\nthe single reflecting control point. This knowledge allows\na more realistic ray tracing geometry to be used when\nattempting to model and predict propagation during such\ndisturbances.\n[66] The ISR records reveal the sudden enhancement of\nelectron density in the E region coincident with the SSC as\nwell of the scale of the increase in electron density that can\nbe expected. The affect of storms and substorms on the\nsignificant modulation of electron density at Es altitudes is\nclearly demonstrated. The ISR records support the lon-\ngevity of enhancement of the Es layer electron density that\nis seen in the ionosonde and oblique sounder records.\nFigure 14. Selection of vertical ionograms from the Tromso ionosonde. (The x axis is frequency in\nMHz, and the y axis is virtual height in km.)\nS06005 RITCHIE AND HONARY: SSC: EFFECT ON HF AT HIGH LATITUDES\n16 of 20\nS06005\n[67] The change in cosmic radio noise absorption as\nmeasured by a riometer reflects the effect of particle\nprecipitation on the D layer and supports the interpreta-\ntion of the ionosonde and oblique sounder data. There is\ngood correlation of the affect of absorption, as expected,\nbetween the oblique sounder, the Tromso ionosonde and\nthe riometer measuring the absorption.\n[68] Key to both case studies are records from the\noblique sounder which reveals the practical effects of an\nenhanced Es layer. The majority of all HF communication\nlinks are planned assuming the use of the F2 layer as the\nrefracting layer as well as assuming a fixed reflection\nheight (normally 250 km). A HF system designed to reach\na particular point or area such as point-to-point links and\ntargeted broadcasting use complex antennas that concen-\ntrate the radiated power in both azimuth and elevation.\nThese two assumptions are perfectly valid when dealing\nwith a quiet ionosphere. However, the variations in the\nheight of the F layer, the reduction of the height of the\nexpected reflecting layer from 250 km to 100 km as well as\nthe phenomena of the Es layer screening the F layer, has\nsevere implications. This can be seen when examining\nFigures 9 and 10. Figure 10 shows the modified geometry\nfor a number of different modes at three different fixed\nheights (300, 350, and 450 km). The change in reflection\nlayer from the F to the Es layer has the most drastic effect\nas the elevation angle changes from a maximum peak of\n22\u0001 at h\u2019F of 450 km to a low of 3\u0001 at h\u2019E of 110 km. For\nmany types of specialist antenna this change is greater\nthan the available elevation beam width. The change in h\u2019F\nfrom 250 to 450 km and the corresponding elevation angle\nmodification from 11\u0001 to 22\u0001 has similar antenna issues.\n[69] Following an SSC event or during magnetic storms,\none rational approach toward using the ionosphere for HF\ncommunications in high-latitude regions is to rely solely\non E layer modes and to provide higher power or in-\ncreased antenna gain in bands appropriate for Es layer\npropagation. Overcoming these problems may prove to be\neconomically challenging for operators of fixed links and\nbroadcasting services. However, with relevance to tactical\nlinks and safety of life transmissions, the oblique sounder\nreveals, counter intuitively perhaps, that instead of reduc-\ning the frequency of operation to reestablish disrupted\nlinks, it would be better to increase the frequency of\nFigure 15.

In the first\ncase study, before the SSC occurs the F layer can support\nreflections from 6 to 11 MHz over this link while the Es\nlayer is supporting reflections between 10 and 15 MHz\nafter the SSC. Twenty min after the SSC there is sporadic\nreflections from the F layer but the Es layer is now capable\nof supporting a number of paths using frequencies\nbetween 12 and 20 MHz. During this period of approxi-\nmately 1 h any attempt to reestablish a link by reducing\nthe operating frequency would be futile. The oblique\nionogram shows no link paths are available on this circuit\nif the frequency is reduced. The only solution is to increase\nthe operating frequency, by more than 5 MHz, in order to\nreestablish the link. The same principle is clearly shown in\nthe second case study where the only manner in which a\nlink can be established in the 2 h following the SSC event\nis for the operator to increase frequency by more that\n7 MHz to be able to utilize the Es layer for communica-\ntions. As explained, in order to implement this mitigation\ntechnique, equipment at both ends of the link will need to\nbe sufficiently frequency agile and have access to antenna\nwith takeoff angles appropriate for Es layer operation.\n[70] Both case studies demonstrate: the effect of the\nionospheric disturbance that is an enhanced Es layer that\ndominates the mode of propagation, the durability of the\nenhanced Es layer allowing the reestablishment of a reli-\nable reflecting layer following the demise of the F layer\nand the viability of using the Es layer in supporting HF\ncommunications at high latitudes. Following up on the last\npoint, the extent of the enhanced Es layer is evident in the\nsecond case study. A 2E mode of propagation is relied on\nover the 3000 km path which requires two Es layer reflec-\ntions spaced 1500 km apart, this is confirmed by ISR data\nshowing similar enhancements in different sectors.\n[71] From an operational point of view a technique is\nneeded to address the uncertainties generated by iono-\nspheric disturbances on key ionospheric parameters and a\nnumber of authors have examined this problem [e.g.,\nTsagouri et al., 2005; I. Barnes et al., Real time ionospheric\nmodels for the Australian Defense Force, paper presented\nat Workshop on the Applications of Radio Science, La\nTrobe University, Beechworth, Victoria, Australia, 27--\n29 April, 2000; R.

A num-\nber of authors have proposed the use of oblique and\nvertical sounding data to provide near real-time iono-\nspheric maps and communication performance parame-\nters [e.g., Zolesi et al., 2004; J. M. Goodman and J. W.\nBallard, Dynamic management of HF communication and\nbroadcasting systems, paper presented at Colloquium on\nFrequency Selection and Management Techniques for\nHF Communications, Institution of Electrical Engineers,\nLondon, 1999]. Certainly while each of these approaches\nhas different applications and merits, the authors have\nchosen another approach.\n[72] The use of propagation prediction programs to\nestablish, in advance, the choice of operating frequency\nis still the basis of many operations. For example HF\nbroadcasting requires frequencies and schedules to be\nagreed months in advance of actual usage and military\nexercises at high latitudes are preceded by detailed\nadvance planning and the distribution of set tables of\nfrequencies well in advance. It appears that this method-\nology of advance planning is good enough for operational\nuse and that the range of parameters produced by the\npropagation prediction programs is adequate for opera-\ntional purposes, during quiet conditions. The problem to\nbe overcome is to determine what propagation parameters\nneed to be modified during disturbed conditions, that is,\nwhat consequential modifications need to be made to the\ncommunications system to ensure some form of continued\noperation during disturbed conditions.\n[73] The authors\u2019 approach is that advocated by Lundborg\net al. [1995], \u2018\u2018It seems that priority should be given to the\ndevelopment of propagation prediction methods which\npredict the deviation from the median rather than the\nmedian.\u2019\u2019 Following research into disturbances affecting\nthe D region the median increase in absorption that needs\nto be taken into account following an SSC has now been\nempirically determined [Ritchie and Honary, 2009a]. An\ninvestigation into disturbances affecting the E region has\nlead to the characterization of the change in the median\nvalue of the critical frequency of Es and the occurrence of\nfully blanketing Es follow an SSC [Ritchie and Honary,\n2009b]. This paper details the deviation of foEs (from its\nquiet ionosphere value) for the 4 h immediately following\nthe SSC and establishes a threshold of deviation that\npredicts the onset of fully blanketing Es. The strength of\nthis approach is that system operators can adjust for the\ndeviation of critical frequencies from the quiet ionosphere\npredictive norm following SSC and the onset of storms,\nwithout the need for a supporting network of vertical and\/\nor oblique sounders.\n[74] Acknowledgments.
